<p>時評</p>
<h3>蘇日僞之「互不侵犯條約」又玄</h3>
<p>調查團報告書發表以來。曾引起國際輿論之若干衝動。其中特以遠東有直接關係之中日兩國及北滿接境之蘇聯爲尤甚。日本際此時會。審知世界輿論對日軍武力侵略東北。一致非難。而國際利益均沾之空氣。乃瀰漫世界。被日本軍閥者。强横　頇。雖至於極頂。而於國際間對此。乃不能不加以深密之注意。以自固其旣得利益。就遠東一般情形論之。英雖居於指導地位。但於東北關係亦甚微薄。此中關心最切利害較重者。厥爲美蘇兩國而已。此兩國中。美國則堅持「門户開放主義。」意在開拓對華市塲。以征取資本主義最後之勝利。蘇聯則根本不同。與日本處於不兩立地位。特於北滿關係爭執尤烈。然審情度勢。美國對遠東開拓刻不容緩。而蘇聯則尚濳心於其第二五年計劃之完成。决不對日輕啓衅端。是以日本熟察蘇聯情勢。猜透美國心理。乃一面積極備戰。一面盡量對蘇聯表示好意。</p>
<p>在日人之意。以爲國際間旣具有若干對日防備之意味。一旦而太平洋上發生戰爭。日本且將陷於孤立。而東三省方面義勇軍之風起雲湧。縱未能收復失地。亦可啓發中國民族之自信。動搖日本之統治。是故彼日閥者亟欲外結蘇聯。内使傀儡。圖以北滿作緩衝。對北滿之積極軍事防衛。表示暫時放鬆集全力以經營南滿。（苟有時機且將攻取關内及熱河。）夫如是。則國聯不能不將就旣成事實。美國亦必以蘇聯之猶豫而躊躇也。是即爲日本唆使滿洲僞國進行與蘇聯訂立互不侵犯條之深意。</p>
<p>蘇聯外交素負盛名在帝國時代之俄國。且能戰敗而不賠欵割地。矧現在革命根基已固。豈能不燭知日本之隱謀耶。且也。蘇聯外交原具二重性格。一爲蘇聯本國。循外交之常態。縱横捭闔於國際之間。致歐洲諸國均顚倒於赤羣之下。一爲第三國際。（蘇聯有絶對的指導權）具有充分的一貫政策。對資本主義持否定態度。到處掀動革命。於是蘇聯乃運用此巧妙的二重。性善用各國内自身之矛盾。及國際間對立關係。以前曾以此打開列强之對俄封鎖政策。今後將借此以完成其國内建設。日本對之。旣欲利用蘇聯以牽制北美合衆國機會均等主義。同時更畏懼第三國際煽動日本軍國中瀕於崩壞之社會。是以日本乃嗾使僞國與蘇聯訂立「互不侵犯條約。」以所謂國防第一線置之北滿。彼乃得而坐收其利。外交設計之工。固在善用敵國之長。彌補其自身之短。其最近對中東路沿線用兵。擬請赤色軍官參與指導。尤爲對蘇聯要好之有效手段。</p>
<p>而蘇聯素審日本深意。更明瞭所謂「滿洲國」也者直爲日本之傀儡。乃何以竟不辭與之交涉。此中因由。俄人自拉狄克評國際調查團報告書謂。「調查團欲使世界帝國主義與日本帝國主義聯成一氣。以抵抗蘇聯。一方面挑撥日本。使其反對蘇聯之加緊。他方面又復故留一綫出路。企圖引蘇聯加入反日戰綫…。」由此可知蘇聯對日之眞意何在也。其所以不辭與僞國協商。而又提出「互不侵犯條約」須蘇、日、僞三者共同協定。乃得成立。眞意所在。有以下數端。</p>
<p>第一、日閥之欲兼併東北三省。事實昭然。無可爲諱。現時必欲利用一般漢奸成立所謂「滿洲（僞）國」者。特顧忌國際爭端之突起耳。故蘇聯即乘日人此種弱點。提議蘇、日、僞三者訂立「互不侵犯條約。」俾打破日本大陸政策之一部。使日人不便立即實行併呑「滿洲。」</p>
<p>第二、中東路沿綫。蘇聯利益雖未即被侵占。但確已大受威脅洮昂路旣已剪斷中東路之軍事上政治上價値。日軍對俄之第一防綫。將由長春一帶而移至興安嶺區域。是西比利亞亦有被侵之虞矣。故蘇聯爲自固藩籬起見。借「互不侵犯條約。」拆去日本在北滿軍事上防御。於西比利亞之開發實有莫大裨益。</p>
<p>第三、美日衝突日趨尖鋭。勿待贅述。設使蘇日（僞）公然訂立「互不侵犯條約。」則無異直接助長日美衝突。使日本備戰更力。挑動日美爭鬥。即打破日本在外交上對蘇之利用政策。使日本自暴其短。</p>
<p>然而日本亦非愚騃。未嘗不深悉蘇聯眞意。是以僅謂「蘇滿互不侵犯。」而擺開日本自身。蘇聯則堅持非日本加入不可。竊恐二者相持。將成爲東亞外交上最中心最難解决問題之一。將來太平洋總淸算時。亦不免以此事之結果卜之。</p>
<p>我國本爲東北三角關係之一。蘇日皆屬緊鄰。東北失陷。尤具生死關聯。際此蘇日勾心鬥角暗算激劇。美國堅持不承認武力刦奪主義之時。確爲外交上新轉機苟能乘時自救。羊尚未亡。補牢更未晚也。</p>

<p>世界社譯大孤每日新聞英文版載紐約特電云、美政府現有改變其遠東政策、轉積極態度爲消極態度之形勢、就從國務院方面接近之人探得之情報觀之、美政府在十一月十四日國聯大會之前、對於滿洲問題、似將不發表任何積極的聲明、史汀生國務卿前此屢次發出之警告、不但未克限制日本、反予日本以極大剌激、使其態度益形硬化關於國聯之動作、日本現被視爲其對美之藐視過於其對英或對法者、史汀生之舉動、已使日美關係大爲緊張、致美人現恐再一失策、或可引起切實之糾紛、如是史汀生政策在美人目中已完全失敗、美國公衆感覺日本民族現正、致國以大亞細亞主義羣固其遠東之防衛、美國單獨與抗、在西太平洋恐非日本之敵、史汀生政策之最强阻力、爲華爾街之反對日美衝突、國務院目下之不得不守緘默、殆有三原因、即其遠東政策之失敗、美海軍之比較的軟弱、及美財政之困　是、此三原因存在一日國務院殆將緘默　日、同時史汀生或將以他種方法向他方面活動、如企圖與英法之結合等、關於此點、美國未必顯然主動、而將竭力運動國聯、倘英或法有一國發起、則美將立即響應之、國務院此種政策、似爲在海外之美外交官所深喻、但美之輿論界及產業界領袖間、信日本之大亞細亞主義勢必失敗、因此不爲日本之經濟現狀所許故也、彼等信日本此種主義一經失敗、則美國無須用力、而其所　向之目的自然達成矣、現信國務院亦取此見解、在此情勢之下、國務院將暫守靜默、而向他方面活動、自在意中、惟有須知者、美國目下之改變其遠東政策、不過爲其方法之改變、至其保護美國在遠東之利益、及制止日本領土　張之根本政策、終將不變、唯關於菲島獨立　進對遠東商務及對檀島關係等政策、或將有少改變而已、</p>

<p>國民社十九日華盛頓電　美京統計學者今日估計、美國因哇太華帝國會議而喪失之貿易、不難乘英國取銷英俄貿易協定而作桑榆之收、苟美國能早日承認蘇俄、則其出口貿易、每年當可增益五千萬元之譜、今英人取銷該協定後、立可蒙其利者、當大半屬諸德商、若再假以時日、德國製造家日後將在蘇俄市塲居領袖地位、他人難與爭勝、至美國商家投仍照目前辦法、售貨與俄人須英商爲之媒介則美國對俄貿易難望立即增加云、</p>

<p>國民社十九日羅京電　羅王喀羅爾復請馬柳敎授佐理國務、使羅國穩渡財政政治難關、馬氏業於今日組織新閣、以鐵杜萊斯科任外相、此次内閣之更迭、可謂鐵杜萊斯科與羅王之勝利、然當此國庫空虚、財政百孔千瘡舉債不易之際、衆信其勝利恐亦未必能持久、且羅王之爲人、可與共患難、往往遇國事棘手之際、即請馬柳柄政、迨難　旣渡、立即　之而云、故料新閣即能應付財政困難、要亦未必能久於其位、惟鐵杜萊斯科外交政策、對於羅俄締結不侵犯條約問題與法國政策適相反、逆料此次羅閣之更迭、將有重大結果、再前相威達未久新閣、亦足見政府黨内部已大爲分裂云、</p>

<h3>戴季陶對於川亂之意見</h3>
<p>考試院院長戴季陶氏、對於四川問題、昨日發表談話如下「近來因國難方殷、而内亂又起、尤以四川地大物博、關係於全國安危、與長江下游商業者至大、故國人無不十分注意、希望其糾紛早息、余生長蜀中、祖宗父母墳墓、均在於斯、十餘年來、對於川事、凡個人能力之所及者、無不盡力爲之、每逢戰亂起時、雖明知所爲無效、亦必盡力勸告、而以誠信不孚、無一次有效力、殊屬慚愧之極憶昔民國十一年冬季、奉總理命入川、勸告各軍息内爭、興實業、當在滬山發之前、總理曾邀請旅滬四川同鄕不下數十人、晚餐席間、痛述内爭爲害於公私之大、請大家盡力勸告、嗣後又發出通電千餘言、字字沉痛、言言切實、其結果未蒙川軍將領之一顧、民國十七年、川中將領亦爲防地而爭、是時正當全國統一、首都肇建、全國南北軍政領袖均因赴全體會議來集首都於是大會指定一委員會、審議川案、與議者除胡　古三先生外、辰閻馮二李及何敬之軍長余亦忝參末議、其時委員會經三次討論、然後决議、復請大會交由國府、明令川中各軍將領遵行之、誠所謂聲淚俱下、當時以爲全國旣經統一、川中或不難底定、中央所貢獻之辦法、已屬原情度理、至於其極、只要各將領稍以國脈民命爲意、即不然者、亦只須以各人自身之前途爲懷、亦必肯委曲求全、聽從中央之勸告、乃明令發表後、其無效也依然、今日之事并非特别、雖或當事者各執其說、而要不外乎私爭之反覆、而所謂經濟問題、交通問題、行政問題云云者、文字雖甚普通、意義則屬奇離、惟有令人民聞之痛心疾首而已、蓋凡心目中稍有國家與人民在者、必不忍將此種題目完全用作私鬥之對象也、連日報載中央有意令余入川勸解、此話並未之聞、余於川事、昔年曾稍致微力、而每次皆毫無效力、如上所述兩次、其尤著者耳、國中領袖信仰能力誰如總理、中央即再組織委員會、並豈易如十七年之會、能遍召全國南北之領袖、則雖責令傳賢作勸和之使、豈易爲力哉、總之四川之事、不在此次戰不戰、今年和不和、而在四川政治前途是否有安定改良的辦法、以余所見四川政治之安定與改良、眞是易如反掌、只問現在的軍事領袖肯回心轉意與否、其權柄責任完全在當局的五七個軍人、雖然四川之亂、其歷史甚長、其關係甚複雜、然而在目前的情况之下、五七個軍人只要澈底覺悟、則一切横的環境、　的歷史、盡可一刀兩斷、從新做起、我也並不以他們是罪人惡極、無可希望、古來大好巨惡的人、一旦回心、爲聖爲賢、建立大功的、并非没有即如印度的阿育王、他初期時代的罪惡、比秦皇是過之無不及的、弑父囚母、誅戮弟兄、功臣百姓的生命財產、更視同草芥、然而一旦覺悟之後、便健立印度空前絶後的統一文明、而功續之留於人間者、爲東西各國建國英雄所未有之崇高偉大、四川之各將領、其罪惡不及初期的阿育王百一、則改惡遷善、何嘗不可能、所以二十年來愈做愈壞、弄到今天的緣故、不是他們兇惡、而是他們没勇氣、没事業心、有錯不認錯、不肯犠牲個人一點利益、說到今後的辦法、余之意見、極爲簡單、三五年前所貢獻於中央與四川諸君者、今仍絲毫未動、就是普通與和平四字、和平的意思、極爲明顯、不必解釋、普通的意義、就是四川的一切政制、絶不可與各省立異、定要和各省、樣、遵照中央所頒布的法令、組織合法的省政府、各軍的將領、要尊重省政府的制度、將民政財政統一起來、然後才有辦法、而其進行程序、則十七年明令所指示者十分周到、今後仍宜完全依爲準則、切實奉行、此外無論想任何特别的方式、越是特别、越是害大、至於如何令大家回心轉意、如何分配工作、此要在原則决定了以後才談得到、如果不把根本原則立起、而只從他們的所謂責任、所謂利害上去淸理、則只有愈說愈遠、愈治愈紛的、四川的前途之可慮、足以令人寒心、如果各軍將領再不覺悟、從事改造、則戰爭之範圍愈大、而統率之單位愈小、由大將領之倒、而變爲小將領割據、由小將領之倒、而引起兵變民變、各處共匪已將肅淸、而四川之禍則方興未已、明末之慘、甚可鑑也、至於西康西藏問題、關係於川局者尤大、余之所見、他日將再貢獻之、」</p>

<p>敎育消息</p>
<h3>特載</h3>
<p>改革中國學校敎育芻議（十一）程·天·放·</p>
<p>中國從前的高等師範本來是獨立的、但是最近十年來都歸併於大學而成了敎育學院了、本來大學内要設立敎育學院—或敎育學系—來研究關於敎育的學理、也未嘗不可以、但是以敎育學院來代替師範大學、那就有點錯誤、因爲敎育學院成爲大學的一部分、牠的學生没有法受特殊的訓練、而同時敎育學院　功課、也往往注重敎書的方法、而忽略了所敎的實質、因此故敎育學院畢業的學生、對於敎育原理敎育方法儘管了解、而實際到中學去敎書、却是一無專長、可以敎國文、也可以敎英文、也可以敎歷史、也可以敎數學、樣樣可敎、而無一樣能敎得很好、這種中學敎員决不是我們所希望的中學敎員、所以將來的師範大學應該照從前高等師範一樣、分國文·外國文·史地·數理·等科、除了敎育原理等課程與同研究外、其他各有專學、學國文的到中學就敎國文、學史地的到中學就敎史地、如此、中學生的學業一定得到更良好的影響、</p>
<p>師範大學和師範學校一樣應該由國家設立、政符選擇全國適中的地點、設立兩個或三個師範大學、已足供目前的需要、師範大學招收兩種學生、一種是師範學校畢業生、服務期限已滿、中間没有不稱職的事體的、可以投考、一種是高中畢業生、不願意入其他大學、而願意從事敎育的、也可以來投考、師範畢業生服務期滿、再入師範大學、因爲過去已經受過特殊訓練、而且有敎學經騐、四年就可以畢業、高中畢業生因爲過去没有師範生特殊訓練、所以要先　兩年預科、一共是六年畢業、師範大學生在校時不收學費、并由政府供給膳食制服、但是畢業以後、由政府委派服務四年、在服務期内、地點不能選擇、生活費也由政府照各地最低限度的、生活來規定服務期滿、才可以自由應聘、在校時或出校後如有違背規則不遵約束的行爲、政府就應該嚴格處分、一方面追繳費用、一方面開除學籍、或取消敎師的資格、這種辦法與師範生的待遇完全一樣、因爲負特殊的使命、所以享特殊的權利旣然享特殊的權利、自然要受特殊的制裁了、政治大學爲什麽又要單獨設立呢、因爲中國現在需要政治人才異常迫切、而從事政治的人是和從事敎育的人一樣應該受特殊訓練的、一個國家所以能夠維持秩序、能夠使得人民生活向上發展、不外乎靠兩種力量、一種是敎育的力量、一種是政治的力量、如果國家失掉這兩種力量、或者用之不當、那這個國家一定是紊亂、退步、以至於滅亡、現在中國是危險極了、我們要救轉這個風雨飄搖的國家也祗有靠敎育和政治、這兩種力量、一定要放在受過特殊訓練能夠　任的人手　、然後才可以造福社會、所以國家一方面辦師範大學造就敎育人才、一方面就要辦政治大學造就政治人才、</p>
<p>要聞</p>
<h3>中大校長羅家倫演講形成有機體的民族文化（二）</h3>
<p>第一種便是政治的改革、當時有（Stein）哈登堡（Hadenbergr）一般人出來把德國的政治改良、公務員判度確立、行政效能增進、使過去政治上種種分歧割裂散漫無能的缺點、都能改革過來、第二種是軍事的改革、有夏恩何斯第(Scharnhors)和格來斯勞(Gneisnau)一般人出來、將德國的軍政整理、特别是將微兵制度確立、並使軍事方面各種準備充實、以爲後來抵禦外侮得到成功的張本、第三種便是民族文化的創立、這種力量最偉大、其影響最普遍而深宏、其具體的表現便靠馮波德（ＷilhemVonHumbodt)創立的柏林大學和柏林大學的茀斯德（Fichte）一般人、所以現代美國著名的歷史家古趣、（G·P·Gooch）認定創立柏林大學的工作、不僅是德國歷史上重要的事、並且是全歐洲歷史上重要的事、尤能使我們佩服的便是當年柏林大學的精神、正當法軍壓境、内部散亂的情况之下、德國學者居然能夠在危城之中講學、以創立德意志民族文化自任、茀斯德於一八○七至一八○八年間在對德意志民衆講演裡說、「我今天乃以一個德意志人的資格、向全德意志民族講話、將這個單一的民族中數百年來、因種種不幸的事實所造成的萬般差異、一掃而空我對於你們在坐的人說的話、是爲全德意志民族而說的」、現在我們也需要如此、我們也要把歷史上種種不幸事實所造成的、所有差異、在這個民族存亡危迫的關頭、一掃而空、從此開始新的努力、德意志民族的統一就是由於這種整個的民族精神先打下一個基礎、最後俾士麥不過是收　他時代的成功、柏林大學却代表當時德意志民族的　魂、使全德意志民族都在柏林大學所創造的一個民族文化之下濳移默化而形成爲這個有機體的整個的組織、一個民族如果没有一種有機體的民族文化、决不能確立一個中心而凝結起來、所以我特别提出創造有機體的民族文化爲本大學的使命、而熱烈誠懇的希望大家爲民族生存前途而努力、</p>

<p>本年美國徧西裴尼亞大學籃球隧、雖非若昔之無敵、然該隊敎練喬德特氏LonJourdet所傳之陣法、若本　所表者、苟運用得當、則守者雖加阻擋時、將感無上困難也、</p>
<p>三號佯爲欲將球傳與二號、實則略徧傳與迎進罰球區之四號、一號沿邊綫而下、五號轉回跑、三號將球傳出後、亦沿罰球區圓弧向籃跑去、其（三號）守衛亦必隨之而下、却正好共同阻碍五號之守衛去路、五號可無拘無索接到四號之傳球而投籃、否則、四號亦可轉身避去守衛者、傳與沿邊綫直下之一號、使運球前進投籃也、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>九三老馬相伯語</p>
<h3>人有愛惡等八情</h3>
<p>— 景·記·</p>
<p>相老人論人情、曾有分析的話：</p>
<p>愛—欲—喜—樂</p>
<p>惡—懼—怨—哀　（圖表）</p>
<p>「說明」</p>
<p>先說「惡」方。</p>
<p>第一步，人覺得「厭惡」，便要「恐懼」的：　如：以前鄕下人，厭惡外國人，就拿來嚇小孩子—可是對於恐懼的人物事件，若是又逃避不了；於是便「抱怨」了，抱怨結局、祇有「悲哀」—</p>
<p>次說「愛」方。</p>
<p>若一有「愛」，隨即有「欲」。宗敎家言。基督耶蘇愛人類，欲救世，寗受萬苦萬艱都不辭了！這是「愛」「欲」相關最好的說敎！如果欲望達到了目的，那麽、自然「歡喜」無量。歡喜即有「樂趣」了。</p>
<p>再拿時事來證相老人所謂「八情」的心理學說。</p>
<p>上海人聽到了閘北槍聲，大家心理、都是厭惡，更有點恐懼那無情的槍彈，飛到自已頭上來；自然抱怨我國太弱，受日本無理的侵犯！淞滬自衛大戰結局，還舉行了一次極悲哀的陣亡衛國將士追悼會！</p>
<p>日本人看中了東三省，便想據爲已有；果然，因爲國軍毫不抵抗，幾天工夫，便得到手；歡喜至極，一年後還要舉行軍民同樂的週年紀念！</p>
<h3>朱朱</h3>
<p>— 持·佛·</p>
<p>—寗爲雞口，毌爲牛後—</p>
<p>誰都曉得宋朝有二程夫子、是有名的理學大家，朱考亭（熹）便是研究他們的學問，成以大儒。豈知現在有二位朱先生，是血性的男兒，單槍匹馬，相繼北上，實地參加戰役，于是東北義勇軍，聲勢大盛，日軍四面應付。疲於奔命了。這兩位朱先生是誰？一是朱慶瀾將軍，一是朱霽靑先生，我便稱他爲民國的「二朱夫子。」</p>
<p>「喔」「喔」是雞的啼聲，「朱」「朱」是雞的呼聲，風俗通說：雞本是朱氏翁所化，所以呼雞曰朱朱。這是一個神話，也不必去管他。在下從前讀朱竹垞曝書亭詩集，見裏面用朱朱兩字，去形容雞啼的聲音，是很多的，我因此便得着下面的感想。</p>
<p>戰國策裏不是說麽？「鄙諺曰：寗爲雞口，　無爲牛後。」司馬子長也有「雞口牛後」之說，古人解釋道：「雞口雖小猶進食，牛後雖大乃出糞。」我想：大人先生的口裏没有不喊着抗日啦，長其抵抗啦，震天價響；甚至終軍請纓，北上殺賊，說得像煞有介事。其實，口硬骨酥，牛步化一般的動也不動、情願開子大口，放屁出糞，那裏肯跟二朱夫子到雞林去殺賊呢！唉！我希望我們做國民的、一寗爲雞口，毌爲牛後！」</p>
<h3>兩種態度</h3>
<p>— 濳·</p>
<p>這是朋友告訴我的兩句話。我覺得很有趣味，現在把它記下來：</p>
<p>人，在没有做官以前，態度容易「激化」；做了官以後，態度容易「腐化」。倘若不信，可在上海看看，再往南京看看。爲什麽有這兩種態度？說不出來！</p>
<p>人，没有結婚以前，對於對方拚命的拍馬屁，好像最下等的奴僕一般；結了婚以後，哼哼，下巴一抬，女人不拍馬屁就得討小老婆！爲什麽有這兩種態度？也說不出！</p>
<h3>附條件的奢侈</h3>
<p>— 陶·在·東·</p>
<p>—可名國奢亦可說奢侈救國—</p>
<p>自一般富豪爲種窮奢極慾，激剌反映，當然引起黜奢崇儉之說，但說者自說，奢侈者自奢侈，無益也。計来如低一格，從奢侈中商量，附一條件，條件惟何？即國奢是，何謂國奢？即專用國貨而屏除歐化是。</p>
<p>因爲大多數之金錢，恣意揮霍暴殄而用之，是謂奢侈。在一方享用過度，固覺不平，另一方則金融藉以流通，工商平民，受其沾溉，故奢侈未可斥爲絶對之惡。信如崇儉之說，則富人死財自奉，將如董卓之堳塢，公孫之京樓，甚或如燕王劉仁恭以鐵錢行用，根括金錢以入於山窖，社會何賴焉。</p>
<p>刺奢有格言焉，曰：「富人一夕酒，窮漢半年糧」。聞者憤歎，然此特舉一個窮漢爲比較耳，其實此一夕酒之所費，沾溉不止一窮漢，越暴殄則沾溉越多，何以故？流通金融故。</p>
<p>所惡乎今之奢侈者、惡其歐化也。舶品漏　，有百害而無一利，斷宜糾正，而專用國貨，衣可綢緞，何必呢絨。酒可花雕，何必香檳？即鴉片者，儘可中士，何必波印？其他類推，要以利權不外溢爲宗旨，是在奢侈者心理一轉移間耳。</p>
<p>就奢侈本身論，歐化之奢侈，幕彷矯揉，非所習慣，何嘗舒適，以云舒適，舉凡起居服御飮食娱樂一切，孰有過於中華者哉？數千年來，踵事增華，豐亨豫大，不必遠徵隋焬宋徽，第近代淸乾嘉、乃至慈禧時代所爲奢侈，諸君試考究其方法而踵行之，發揮光大，竟可造成一種國奢，非徒調劑國内金融、爲均貧富之手段也，以麻雀西行例之，將使巴黎學步，紐約效顰，同化於我國奢，則諸君胡天胡帝，雖曰奢侈救國可也，崇儉云乎哉？</p>
<h3>林森小軼事</h3>
<p>— 秋·郎·</p>
<p>—遭衛兵的奚落—</p>
<p>國府主席林森，高年碩德，他是一位黨國的和藹長者，雖然外界有譏諷他是監印主席，勸駕主席，（挽留院部長）等等，但在這國難時期，主席一職，固然也非易爲的吧！而且他爲各方奔波，積勞致疾，來申就醫，最近傳聞又因修譜回閩，他正是貴人多貴事啊。我現在來紀述他一件軼事，當他未曾榮任主席之先，一天因有要公，親去奉訪蔣介石氏，那知走到總司令部的門口，就被守衛的兵士攔阻，他雖向士兵說明我是林某，無奈衛兵總不相信，因爲見他衣服非常樸素，料非要人，直弄得他無計可施，竟與衛兵齟齬起來！那時蔣氏可巧由内出來，見到是他，忙說請進，這些衛兵都莫名其妙，祗得舉槍致敬了，唉！現在的社會上，本是勢利，「只重衣衫不重人」正令人不勝慘嘆啊！</p>
<h3>亭子間程</h3>
<p>— ·魯·丁·</p>
<p>—胡思亂想—</p>
<p>當然囉，這只怪我家庭的貧寒與我自已的不靈，如果家裏是個財主的話，决定不坐亭子間，如果自已是有能力的話，决定不坐亭子間，反過來說，如果没有亭子間，也决不會有區區阿拉在上海。</p>
<p>「僅堪容膝，」不能伸頭，「聯床話風雨，」隔壁聽打架，這兩句話，要不可信以爲眞，然而說起了亭子間，却也是一個確切的描寫呢—即使你退一步想，陋巷之中，早有顏回，破床之側，乃是原憲，安貧樂道固未可厚非，縱搖頭與樓板按摩，縱轉身則家具跳舞，庸又何妨，那芳鄰的　語，那小孩的哭聲，亦未始不是你夢中的音樂，有時，門雖設而常開，吹起了微微之風，有時窗雖有而莫能阻，進來了毛毛之雨，則盡美矣，又盡善也。</p>
<p>縱或不然，你的尊脚或者穿過了廚房，你的貴手或者來到了客堂，固尤要小心翼翼的，恐怕在夢中也會走到了鄰家去，而爲不速之客了！</p>
<p>雖情理上之所必無，而事實上之所難有，但在亭子間呢，說得到，做得到，而且，辦得到。</p>
<p>亭子間和住客的種類不同，有亭子間的文學家，有亭子間的流浪人，還有亭子間的嫂子，阿拉也是亭子間的一位貴客！</p>
<p>短訊　五洲固本皂廠。現爲酬答　國仕女起見。特將大批名貴香皂。分紮成組。每組計二十餘塊。僅售一元。可謂廉極。本埠五洲藥房總店。及各支店。同時舉行。鴻</p>

<p>不拘艱苦和甜蜜的光陰，都一般過得飛快。眨眨眼已到了民國二十一年的夏天，快要做「九一八」的週年紀念了！而整個的東北，死氣沉沉的瀋陽，依然在水深火熱的狀况下，被日本兵的鐵蹄踐踏着，没有一綫的光明，更没有中華民國收復的希望。也許是那老大病夫般的中國，麻木得已失去了知覺，無故被强人割斷了肢體的一部，都昏昏沉沉忘記了這痛苦，而甘心捨棄了吧？</p>
<p>麻木的本身，或者還不感什麽苦痛？只是那被强人硬拖在刀砧上生呑活剝碎剮凌遲的那一部，郤不見得好受，還有那被抛撇下在這上面的三千萬無辜與可憐的民衆，平白地會像没有爹媽管的苦孩子一般，度着求生不得求死不能的俘虜生活，尤其是悲慘絶倫，非尋常人所能想像。</p>
<p>所以魯伯勤幸而尚有愛人慰藉着，而每每蒿目時艱，興懷國恥，總不禁有一股無名的孤憤，時時會在和愛人談情話的當兒，突然奮發衝動起來，要狂歌當哭聲碎碰壺那樣一傾吐爲快，但說話的地點多半是在佟家，佟一貞的叔叔總是聽得見的，起初尚只是面無人色的低聲勸告，要緊記着明哲保身，多言賈禍，莫忘了隔牆有耳，牽累堪虞，及後來日本人一手製造的那個滿洲國出現了；這位叔太爺忽的換了個强硬態度，竟敢當面厲聲駁斥魯伯勤那些咒詛日本的言語爲大不敬。有一次，並自承是個滿洲國的人民，不能容忍一個反動份子在他家裡公然誹謗滿洲國。若不念在一向的私交分上，一定去報告日本憲兵隊給你點利害嘗嘗。再不然，請到别處發這種狂悖的議論去，這裡最輕的懲罰，不惜抬出一道逐客令捧出一碗閉門羡來。似乎滿洲國人民很能凸起肚子充硬漢，再不希罕魯伯勤這個關以内的外國人那點補助家用的小惠了。</p>

<h3>外匯掛牌放長一擋</h3>
<p>内盤英金先硬繼平</p>
<p>美　龍平後俏</p>
<p>昨日銀市仍以英升美平　匯兌續降二分至一分四三七五、至滬市匯興掛牌放長一擋、計英美各長二五、其餘一致改賤、惟香港如　、殆内盤稍有異趨、計英金前市頗硬、後市回平、較前午略長○六二五、而美金前平後俏、尚縮一二五不　明鬆暗緊之景况、總之英美匯兌暴落之故所以大條激漲、國際銀會將開、乃物價應須提高焉、至標金尚稱堅俏、昨市前仆後起、各銀行交易活動、計英金成交十餘萬鎊、金帮稍售、洋商如沙遜續購遠期、又美金約共六七十萬元、各金號供過於求、間有奔回金子、銀公司及沙遜均有納進、</p>
<p>英匯　内盤全日有一二五榮辱、自早開出價十月及十一月同爲一先令九便士四三七五、十二月半便士、正月五六二五、進價九便士半至六二五、華比吃十二月九便士六二五、華比賣與荷蘭台灣十月九便士半、（沙遜進）與業吃正月六二五、華比入十一月五六二五、大英出正月六二五、（沙遜進）花旗吸十二月六二五、午收賣價一先令九便士半至六二五、買價五六二五至六八七五、下午上海出十一月半便士、華比入正月六二五、匯豐賣與華比十月九便士半、收市出價九便士四三七五至五六二至、進價半便士至六二五、</p>

<h3>倫敦銀市無動靜</h3>
<p>國民社二十日倫敦電、大條近期仍爲十七便士八分之七、遠期仍爲十八便士、英美匯價、開三元三角九分、</p>
<h3>釐市進退失據</h3>
<p>昨市洋交方面、依然不十分疎散、可是愈旺而釐價愈跌、其外表一種矛盾景况、頗爲局外有所懷疑、其實個中内幕、確有進退失據之形勢、緣近日銀行方面買賣旣無一定凖　、又鮮十分把握、更以目下存底豐富、一遇滯銷、卽有防跌之虞、而錢業同行有互相扯高之用意、是以一經銀行收買、卽行抬昂、欲詢其漲風之　、則瞠目無可對答、故吾調變幻靡定、亦現象之鐵證也、</p>
<p>釐價早午逕庭銀拆下落　「洋釐」早市釐價忽又高昂一釐、計爲七錢零八釐三毫七忽半、午市忽爾下落八毫七忽半、爲七錢零七釐半、結果較前日午市之價、改好一毫二忽半、經過重大盤旋、而終相彷彿、誠難得焉、「銀拆」早午兩市、同爲三分、較前日頓小三分、劃頭加水則有一錢左右、銀根氣象、大都平鬆如恒、</p>
<p>角洋互有漲跌銅元微縮　江南小洋、較前日趨跌二釐、不及二分、市面僅爲六錢一分八釐、早市兩市均無上落、交易早市七千五百角、午市二千角、廣東小洋、早市爲五錢九分七釐半、午市爲五錢九分八釐半、兩市轉昂一釐、交易早市十一萬五千角、午市九萬五千角、銅元微縮五百文、爲四百二十千零五百文、交易四萬九千餘串</p>
<p>銀收解略覺旺盛頭襯多　銀行收解消息、比較前日旺盛多多、蓋是爲例有之比期、而票欵較多之故、華商收解票欵三百二十餘萬、外商收解票欵二百六七十萬、電匯欵八十萬、墊一百萬、各種貨匯稅雜洋特各欵收解一千三百七八十萬、押欵交易一百五六十萬、進倉一百萬、出倉三十萬、錢莊銀公單收解三千八百餘萬、劃頭欵收解五百十餘萬、各路　欵收解一百餘萬、解現五六十萬、</p>
<p>洋交易亦頗不弱客銷平　市場中匯劃票欵、早市做出九十二萬五千、午市一百四十二萬七千、鈔票早市八萬七、午市六萬五千、場外鈔票早市十四萬四千、午市八萬五千、支單早市萬五千、午市四萬、銀行買賣、早市互市八十五萬、午市一百二十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解二百十餘萬、鈔票收回及發出一百六七十萬、錢莊洋公單收解八百七十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解二百七十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出二百三十餘萬、外埠裝出一百三十萬、洋押欵交易九十餘萬、小錢莊買賣鈔票匯頭及現洋等互市六七十萬、</p>
<h3>長期甬欵交易訉</h3>
<p>本届長期、本埠銀錢業進出情形頗爲冷靜、時　兩旬、面成交額不過千萬、詳情屢誌本報、惟寗波莊友來申已久、上届十五日曾有一度做過交易、然多數轉賬未聞有若何新交易、始於昨日得悉甬莊長期欵有活動訊、聞做與洋行街及　燕帮　約有一百餘萬、廠方做開二三百萬、洋貨帮完全未有見聞、而個中内容互相私交者固屬不少、惟數頗不大、從不及萬、其他綢業方面、亦有少數做定、據錢業中人云、今年我業對於長期放欵雅不欲從事擴充、如果有相當押欵交易、則不　多、司見今年市面凋零、放欵上不易流動之弦外　也、至於息價大約九兩以外、有十一兩以外、其中市價等級、大相懸殊、似未有一定之標準也、</p>
<h3>證劵債價漲市况盛</h3>
<p>—需要較旺各價復好三四角—</p>
<p>—成交共達四百九十餘萬元—</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所各債市况、期貨餘九六金融外、其他本下月期貨均開齊、市面情形、忽頗活潑、各方以需要增盛、買賣進出交易、遠勝前日、計上午成交二百七十餘萬、後市亦有二百十餘萬元、合計四百九十二萬、元内鹽稅佔一百二十七萬五千元、統稅八十四萬五千元、二零關捲裁兵各約六十萬、其他計二三十萬元、惟整六關稅九六仍甚淸、金融續無市、現貨市况則仍　落、全日僅計一萬三千元、至各債趨勢、則爲國内局勢稍較前爲樂觀、且瞬届下旬、掉期交易增盛、各方零星投資及了結補進交易、概頗活潑、以是市面求過於供、遂比前日一致續漲、但以大户仍未有較鉅成交、趨勢依然平和、結果除關稅二零關現貨各漲近一元、統稅現貨裁兵期現貨漲近半元、其他續好二三角左右、趨勢蓋均極一致云、</p>

<h3>糧食米價跌落五六角</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日西路來源被南港口扣押船隻未通、本街交易呆滯、窑種百哥野稻等貨、猛跌五六角、西新陳破亦跟跌二三角、洋杜尖無榮辱、全日浦江斛開五百担左右、</p>
<p>新閘　　路航船已通、城鄕店胃因新貨關係、胃口極淡、新粳破龔窑種各低四角、惟白稻貨稀、鄕胃　好、形勢續挺、新陳洋杜尖及埠尖受洋米影響、形低二角、聞野雞墩一帶船户、約二百餘號、今明二日雙方當可解决、市面看小、</p>
<h3>粉市午後忽起巨大跌風</h3>
<p>—達期跌進八錢關—</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、微呈平堅之象、以洋麥報價、微好一二角左右、故業外人心、稍形堅穩、較之前日收價好五釐左右、惟交易其少、始終居　俏而已、迨至下午　　、　期又起巨大之跌風、因澳洲麥又　價　兜、傳白麥定價、祗三兩大錢二分、大小廠家、又有定開、故自十二月份起、　新·阜豐·信大·　豐·祥新各廠、均一致暢抛、尤以一月份起爲更暢、致市面逐步大落、一二三月均跌進八錢關口、此種價格、　洋麥趨勢而言、尚不能站住、恐跌到一兩七錢半、亦未爲奇、至本月份與廠家現貨、仍喊九錢、故爲帶住、然亦係硬做而已、結果本月份較小五釐、十一月份跌一分七釐半、十二月份至三月份各跌二分二釐半云、</p>
<h3>遠期麥因抵空平穩</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、大致呈平穩之態、以洋麥報價回好一二角不等、故人心堅定、比前日收價回好二三分左右、迨至下午開盤、本月份微見軟弱、遠期因四十三號抵空甚亟、市形穩定、惟各盤交易寂寞、買户無幾、照目下現貨洋麥定價低廉標麥行情恐仍未能穩定也、結果本月份不動、十一十月份較好二分、一月份好三分、二三月份好二分、現麥市面尚見平靜、開瑤灣麥五百包、價三兩四錢、由華豐辦去云、</p>
<h3>糖市惠州白開出千餘包</h3>
<p>—荷赤市勢轉緊—</p>
<p>昨糖市公會劃盤二十四號粗砂白以及中砂白等、平平如前、均乏上落、洋行方面有怡和開出二十四號粗砂白一百五十噸、十一月份裝船、價爲荷幣四元六角三分、尚屬合宣、市形頗俏、荷　　盤因號方扳守、且擬啟價收進、故趨勢突轉緊俏、八號劃過十兩零八錢、九十號十一兩二三錢、庚　號家昨開出惠州白千餘包、價爲十四兩三四錢、建帮號家開出王　白冰一百數十箱、每砠價爲十兩零三錢、統手冰數十箱九兩八錢、</p>
<h3>絲茶無錫新秋繭陸續運滬</h3>

<h3>閘北貨金針菜號盤堅守</h3>
<p>—泉化元後貨减少—</p>
<p>金針菜近日到貨不多、查各號手存、前到者約有千餘包、行家曾按十三兩半至十三兩、由號方打電向地頭探詢意見、昨據復電、均不肯放兌、故號貨均已轉棧一律扳守、市勢因此略緊、惟行存尚多、一時恐難過高云、</p>
<p>泉州大泡桂圓、現市高貨尚俏、然中下莊極疲故開價轉跌、惟據昨日地頭電訊、後船來貨大减、聞裝申貨件、統共僅六百餘、市勢當可平定矣、</p>

<p>「赤老」這個名詞，在上海低級社會裏、時時可以聽見，「赤老」二字的意義和來源、我無從查考，總而言之，大約是個不祥的名詞罷了，但德國現在有個「赤老，」並且是一個鼎乖乖的女「赤老，」</p>
<p>十八日柏林電，德國會復開時，爭議長席者，將有年老議員兩人，一爲李自曼將軍，年八十二，一爲席特金女士，年七十五，乃共產黨健將，人呼爲國會之赤老，此二老者，眞孟子所謂天下之大老矣，惟赤母之名稱，德人呼之固當，在他國人呼之，不能謂之赤母，只能稱之爲「赤老」因老太太而又信仰赤化主義者也，這種「赤老」非但我國下級社會裏尋不出，即上級社會裏也找不到，眞是「赤老」</p>
<p>德國會爭議長席者，一個是將軍，一個是「赤老」將軍年八十二，「赤老」年七十五，均是古稀以上的年齡，像這樣老大的年紀，在我國必定老態龍鍾，索然興盡，而德國這兩位老人，猶復興致不淺，競爭議長，於此可見德人氣體之强悍，精神之　　，至老不衰，宜其國之强盛也，故同是「赤老」一個名詞，我國對之，何等鄙視，而外國對之，何等尊稱，亦全視「赤老」能力之如何矣，</p>
<p>陳獨秀亦主張赤化主義者，近日被捕，解京處辦，然陳僅五十四歲，未及花甲之年，而髮已頒白，精神頽喪，老態盎然，故赤則赤矣，而老則未也。</p>

<h3>幾種化妝品製造法</h3>
<p>— 顧·學·裘·</p>
<p>市上所售化妝品，種類極多，其中固不乏有良佳者，然亦有許多劣貨，充斥市上，並且有許多名貴之品，仰給於外國，每年金錢之外溢，不可勝數。另有一般奸商，專以劣貨發售，騙人賺錢，使用者不但不得其益，而反受害不淺，然欲自製，亦非難事，毫不須深奥的化學知識，更無須有豐富的經騐，且自製價廉物美，不但無被欺之事，而所値比市上所售的便宜多哩！現在將我實騐所得的幾個方法，介紹於后：</p>
<p>冷香脂的製法：</p>
<p>原料　上白石臘油　六十克</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>白臘　十五克</p>
<p>玫瑰香水　二十四克</p>
<p>硼砂　一克</p>
<p>玫瑰油　酌量（數滴）</p>
<p>製法　先拿白臘徐徐溶於石臘油中，其温度約在攝氏表六十度左右，不可過高，同時又將硼砂溶於玫瑰香水中加熱，牠的温度與石硼油相等，大約也在六十长左右，然後再將硼砂與玫瑰香水的溶液，徐徐加入石臘油中，以棒不停的拌攪，使其均和，至成爲白色脂狀時，待稍冷後，將玫瑰油加入，因熱時將香料加入，往往容易使香氣飛散，故不可不注意的，香料加入後，封入大口瓶内即得。</p>
<p>司丹康的製法</p>
<p>原料：　石臘　十克</p>
<p>臘油　　十克</p>
<p>凡士林　五克</p>
<p>燭紅粉　酌量</p>
<p>玫瑰油　數滴</p>
<p>製法先將石臘及臘油混合於鍋中，加熱待其融化，再加凡士林，不絶拌攪，繼又加入燭紅粉酌量之，使顏色呈粉紅色爲佳，頗爲美觀，若要綠色，可加入酌量之燭綠粉，待冷卸時加入香料即成。</p>
<p>以上原料配製的比率，倘不能得最滿意的結果時，可隨意增減臘油或石臘，使其軟硬適中，膏性則以凡士林的多寡而定：</p>
<p>洗鬆劑的製法。</p>
<p>原料：薔薇水　二百五十份</p>
<p>透明肥皂　四十份</p>
<p>酒精　五十份</p>
<p>番紅花　五份</p>
<p>製法：　先將透明肥皂及番紅花加適宜的蒸溜水，煑沸後使其溶解，再加入薔薇水及酒精，靜置數日後，再取出濾過，下面所得的濾液，即可應用。</p>
<p>以上三種方法，手續簡單，原料便宜，讀者不妨一試，至於原料的購置，那麽你們可向西藥房，或中國科學儀器館均可購得。</p>

<h3>建議革除烟酒的惡習</h3>
<p>— 錫··</p>
<p>在現在經濟感到極度困難的我們中國，節約運動正應高唱的時候，在此，我有這一個小小的建議—革除烟酒的惡習。</p>
<p>烟酒本來是最普遍而一件應酬的小事。似乎不値得我們這麽大驚小怪的去「小題大做」。可是你得想想，假如把一天的烟酒的消費早能統計起來，一定會使我們吃驚而戰慄！</p>
<p>「祇會消費，不事生產」的人太多。這大概使我們中國弄到這樣窮的原因之一吧！</p>
<p>在不久的過去，中秋的那幾天，我很記得有許多人得倡不吃月餅，把節省下來的錢去捐助東北的義勇軍。這是很有價値而値得我們欽佩的一件事，但這倒竟還是一年一度難得的機會，良機錯過，未免要嘆聲「可惜」！雖是義軍還是拼命和日人肉搏着！</p>
<p>烟酒之比月餅，其消費量正不知要大幾千萬倍，如果能一巨的廢止，所節省下來的錢，一面去捐助義軍，一面作救國基金，趕造飛機，兵艦，軍械；待我們軍餉豐富了，實力充足了－那時，那怕你有十個象現在這樣的日本，也不過在我們手掌之中。</p>
<p>話雖說得太遠，但如果你能設法革除，於國家亦非小補吧！</p>
<p>而且，烟酒都是富於刺激性，能使你的腦子受了過多的刺激，會愚笨而遺忘　增强。像鴉牌一吸之者，會使你傾家蕩產，身體瘦弱，有時會呌你提早的走入墳墓！</p>
<p>總之，烟酒是有害無益的東西，實有革除的必要。至其革除的方法，如國府明令的禁止。或抽重稅，這都是辦法之一。本席不過是建議，至於能否議决通過。還請各會員詳細的討論。</p>
<p>學堂寫眞</p>
<h3>原來如此</h3>
<p>— 蘇·生·</p>
<p>爲要懂得一點善通法學常識起見，所以本學期要要緊緊地選讀一課法學通論：這和爲了學分而選讀的課程，自然有些不同了。</p>
<p>起初聽見說：今年法學通論的敎授，是一位雙料博士，法學博士還兼着哲學博士，並且歷任國内各大學法學敎授，這樣由他資格和履歷看來，學問的淵博，當無疑義了。</p>
<p>然而事體總有出人意料之外者：迨我聽見這位博士敎授的高論之後，又不得不使我流於失望的深淵了；原來這位博士是如此的，實在是我們所意想不到的，上起課來，儘是亂說，語無倫次，一無頭緒，寫起字來，尤如蟹爬，啊！博士敎授，原來是如此的喲：</p>
<p>敎授旣然如此，學生當然也隨便起來了。因此敎室裏面，則儘出現些花花絮絮的事情了。看儘報哪：打磕睡哪！看小說哪，互相談話哪！胡閙哪！形形色色，無奇不有，當眞是聽的，可說是絶無僅有，這位敎授所講的說的，恐怕只有牆壁能夠感應了。</p>
<p>在這樣的情形之下，敎授當覺感很苦的！旣然是自講自聽，何必要苦着嘴苦着腿費着神做這種徒然的事情呢？在學生方面當然也極感煩悶，坐在敎室裏，旣然是無所獲益，又何必要苦着屁股，和板凳拚命呢？這豈不都是傻子的舉動嗎？</p>
<p>哼！說他們是傻子的人，自已才是傻子呢？要知道，現在的敎員的目的，並不一定是敎道學生，或者是傳授學問，所以學生們不聽，儘管可以；祗要飯碗長長捧牢，或者說是薪水拿到腰包就是了，</p>
<p>那魔現在的學生，又是什樣呢？說來也頗奇怪。誰知他們到學校裏來的目的，又也不是有什麽學問的探討，以及道德和品行的修養。所以敎授拆爛汚，也儘管可以，只要學了半年學分到手，讀讀四年文憑到家就算了。所謂文憑，就是他們唯一無二的目的了。</p>
<p>中國有句俗話：「不是一家，不進一家門，」如拿這句俗話，來譬倣我們現在的大學生和大學敎授，那才是一點不錯呢！有了這種專門爲文憑的學生，所以也有了這種專門爲銅錢的敎授，這的確堪稱是一家人。</p>
<p>家庭問題</p>
<h3>二幕慘劇</h3>
<p>— 小·波·</p>
<p>大約是在一個初秋的晚上，照例我們一家人都聚在一起吃着晚飯，忽然聽見外面一聲救命呀！的狂急而帶些無力的悲哀的慘呌，從東隣的王家發出，傳到我們耳朶裏，不容說，我們就不約而同的放下飯碗，都十分驚疑的飛步走出門去，祗見王家的門口，早已人山人海有湧得水洩不通，陸家媽媽李家婆婆，都在議論着訕笑着，當然的站在評判之列，我就開始作着其中的新聞記者，原來剛纔慘呌的，就是年逾花甲而且非常衰頽，走路要怕風吹倒的王老婆呀，她的丈夫是經營着一個小布店，歷年過着勤儉素樸的日子，所以手頭還有些積蓄，不幸早年就故世了，所遺下的一個十八九歲的兒子，還不到父親死後兩年，因爲害了肺病，也跟着去世了，唉！你想王老婆遭到這們天崩地覆的不測，傷慟也不容說，因此老態也更加衰敗了。</p>
<p>後來她自已打算着，以爲從此王氏没有後代，手邊又缺了奉侍和整理薄產的人，是不行的，就商妥了親戚，替她向别處領一個兒子，這兒子年紀已經十三四歲子，諸位想這樣大的兒子，怎麽養得馴呢？而且他本家還很富有，只因父母生他弟兄八九個，他最頑皮，最會化錢，所以巴不得他們領了去。</p>
<p>他進了王家的門，故態度復萌，一味的揮霍，對他的繼母，好像奴婢一樣，但是可憐的王老婆，竟背地裏落眼淚，唖子吃苦瓜，說不出的苦，</p>
<p>這樣的過了四五年，她還做起望孫的夢來，就替他娶個妻子，當初婆媳倆感情還不算歹，到後來，因爲老年頭腦固執，難免有些嚕囌，你想這精明嬌滑的媳婦，怎肯忍受她呢，就此時常向丈夫面前挑禍，說老骨頭如何不好，如何作孽，這無情的野兒子，居然聽了妻子的話，再三的帮同她辱駡王老婆，</p>
<p>那天事情，忽然凑巧，王老婆因爲常常受他倆的寃曲，跑到鄰近人家去鬥紙牌，想消散心裏的苦悶，那知晚上跑到家裏，他和她兩對虎狼般目光，洶洶的釘在王老婆的面上，她兒子開始厲聲的駡道，你這老骨頭，眞老暈了，你怕不知道這樣窘迫的年景，那裏有錢被你亂化呢，並且……，王老婆忍不住的也駡道，你這逆種，你天天出去軋朋友，賭錢，喝酒，難道不是我的錢麽，怎麽我偶然尋些快活，就這樣犯法麽？豈不渾蛋，話未說完，惹得那兒子聽了惱羞成怒，伸起了鐵拳，向王老婆的胸部猛力的打來，本拳兩脚，立刻把四肢無力的王老婆跌倒在地上，唉，我寫到這裏也不忍再寫了，祇得歎着倫常乖舛，世風日下，並替我國舊思想的家庭悲傷，</p>
<p>羞</p>
<h3>女子在什麽時候最怕羞？</h3>
<p>— 螞·蟻·</p>
<p>昨天去參加Ｘ社的集會，很有趣地遇到了一件别開生面的餘興，本來餘興大都脫不了唱唱跳跳，可是這次的餘興，眞是意外地了，</p>
<p>先由主席就到席的社員中，約略分做幾區，數約十人爲一區，然後出了一個題目，呌做「女子在什麽時候最怕羞」？給每一區各自去討論，須能滑稽有趣，討論結果，每一區推派一善辭令者登臺演說，綜合各區的演說，評定甲乙，其評定方法，即以最博人笑的爲冠，而討論的時間，僅限十五分，以是在限定時間以後，均先後登臺交卷，結果，妙趣横生，聆略了許多的笑料，錄之，讓大家也來一粲吧，</p>
<p>第一個是姓張的先說，這位張先生在Ｘ社中本是滑稽出名的，他常能抓着現成的機會說笑話，這天到會人中，却有對訂婚未久的未婚夫婦，張先生就把他們做了對象，說：「女人怕羞的事多啦，如其單憑理想說空洞的，不如說現實可證明的較佳，即像我們現在要求蜜司梁向着蜜司脫許（即一對未婚夫婦）呌一聲親愛的哥哥，我想蜜司梁一定要感到十分的難爲情，這時候想係最怕羞的時候了，！」一陣掌聲和笑聲，梁小姐的臉上眞個飛了二朶紅雲，襯在白嗶嘰的外衣裏，亦見得嬌羞了，張君奪了第一名，以後還有許多人演講的故事，這裏僅　錄一些言論，</p>
<p>「當着熱天的時候，身上只穿着蟬翼似的衣服，正在大庭廣衆，交際得忙不交開的時候，突然春色關不住，紅杏出牆來，這時候的女子，一定羞得說不出話來，」</p>
<p>「哥哥娶了嫂嫂，隔了半年，嫂嫂的肚皮高了起來，現皮的小弟弟，當着嫂嫂的面問，嫂嫂你的肚皮怎會大起來，這時候做嫂嫂的女子，羞的程度非可言諭了，」</p>
<p>「打扮得齊整的姑娘，頭髮是　得水浪形，旗衫又漂又亮委拖在脚跟，在長衩間露着圓圓腿，襯着一雙淡米色的絲襪，踏了雙　花圓口的白緞鞋子，　娜娉婷，走在馬路上，眞夠令人注目，不幸在這時候，後面衝來了一個魯男子，怱忙地將這位姑娘的鞋子後跟踏脫了，眞尶𡯓，！絲襪的後跟，正有一個破洞，凑巧走過一個小滑頭，看了拍着手喊起來，「啊！破襪子」，過路的人都跟着她，抿着嘴笑，這時候的那位姑娘，尶𡯓的形狀與及怕難爲情的態度，只有用攝影機來收拍了，」</p>
<p>「老是在朋友前唱獨身主義的女子，起先意志極堅强，隔不多年，她的朋友又碰到了她，看她左一個右一個小孩子，問起她從前唱獨身主義的時候的情形，這個女子一定羞得可憐，」</p>
<p>「……」多啦，女子怕羞的事還多啦，如果再把聽到的統統寫出來，連我也要替女子羞答答了，</p>
<p>這些都是在Ｘ社餘興中得來的資料，</p>
<p>覺悟</p>
<h3>從影片得到啓示</h3>
<p>— 一·萍·</p>
<p>自從結婚以來，没有找到過相當的職業，生活當然每天在風雨飄搖之中，從前還能到處爲家，但是有了妻的人，更要顧全共同生活，所以感到明天的麫包將設法的時候，時當發出怨天尤人的咒咀，兩人偶然說話高了一點，就是一幕莫須有的爭吵劇，世界上的一切都建築在物質上面，我們旣是每天要吃飯的人類，天然在不滿足，而不能滿足時想找一個對手方來出氣，所以每次爭吵，總是雙方諒解，更進一步勉職奮鬥，</p>
<p>昨天，在生活的鞭策下，稍能有喘氣的餘地，我們倆到中等影戲院觀經慈善家失慶瀾先生題字，哄動一時的人道，本片的價値如何，早有許多電影附刋及報紙，爲了批判，牠以陜災爲背景，而描寫都市的罪惡，片中的對照文字幕幕可爲醉生夢死的晨鐘暮鼓，</p>
<p>歸來的途上，妻感慨的說「吃樹皮草根那纔苦，我們每天倒底還有白米飯吃，我從今後不羨慕人家的洋房汽車了，比我們苦的人還多着哩！」</p>
<p>女子的虚榮心是天賦的，她和我結婚以來，没有過過都市的闊綽生活，看了人道，能同情於貧苦人的遭遇，我笑着說，「那纔是我的妻子」！</p>
<p>「從前不是？」她恨恨的望了一眼，也隨着笑了，</p>
<p>我們快活的歸來，房中的一切並不像平時的憎厭，每處都顯着活潑的精神，我們的生活還在天堂上，我更增加了奮鬭的勇氣，這是影片給我們的啟示，</p>
<p>突然馬路上發生爭吵，推開窗來，是一個坐汽車在轉灣角上打黄包車夫的耳光，他坐上汽車開定了，</p>
<p>「坐汽車的是人，拉黄包車的也是人，」妻憤憤的說，「喊他去看看人道！</p>
<p>「哼！」</p>
<p>「什麽？」</p>
<p>「他們不過在幾百元鈔票中抽出一張一元的鈔票說，「拿去，我也救了一條命，」（人道一幕）</p>
<p>「嘻…嘻」妻的苦笑，</p>

<h3>The Enigmatic "Non-Aggression Pact" between the Soviet Union and the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Since the publication of the League of Nations' Lytton Report, it has stirred up some international public opinion. Among them, China and Japan, which have direct relations with the Far East, and the Soviet Union, which borders North Manchuria, are particularly concerned. At this time, Japan, recognizing that world opinion unanimously condemns the Japanese military's armed invasion of the Northeast, and that the atmosphere of equal distribution of international interests prevails throughout the world, despite the extreme arrogance and obstinacy of the Japanese militarists, cannot but pay close attention to this internationally to secure its vested interests. Generally speaking, in the Far East, although Britain occupies a leading position, its relationship with the Northeast is very weak. The most concerned and interested parties are the United States and the Soviet Union. Among these two countries, the United States insists on the "Open Door Policy," intending to open up the Chinese market and seize the final victory of capitalism. The Soviet Union is fundamentally different and is in an irreconcilable position with Japan, especially with fierce disputes over the North Manchurian relationship. However, considering the situation, the United States is in urgent need of developing the Far East, while the Soviet Union is still focusing on completing its Second Five-Year Plan and will definitely not lightly provoke Japan. Therefore, Japan, fully aware of the Soviet Union's situation and guessing the United States' intentions, is actively preparing for war while trying its best to show goodwill to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Japanese believe that since there is some sense of international prevention against Japan, once a war breaks out in the Pacific, Japan will be isolated. Moreover, the rise of volunteer armies in the three northeastern provinces, even if they fail to recover lost territory, can inspire the confidence of the Chinese nation and shake Japanese rule. Therefore, the Japanese authorities are eager to ally with the Soviet Union externally and control the puppet regime internally, attempting to use North Manchuria as a buffer zone and expressing a temporary relaxation of active military defense in North Manchuria to concentrate all efforts on managing South Manchuria. (If there is an opportunity, they will also attack Shanhaiguan and Jehol.) If this is the case, the League of Nations cannot but accept the fait accompli, and the United States will also hesitate due to the Soviet Union's hesitation. This is the deep meaning behind Japan's instigation of the Manchurian puppet state to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Soviet diplomacy has always enjoyed a great reputation. Even during the imperial era, Russia was able to win wars without paying reparations or ceding territory. Now that the foundation of the revolution has been consolidated, how could it not be aware of Japan's hidden motives? Moreover, Soviet diplomacy originally had a dual character. One is the Soviet Union itself, following the normal state of diplomacy and engaging in skillful maneuvering in the international arena, causing European countries to fall under the sway of the Red menace. The other is the Third International (the Soviet Union has absolute leadership), which has a fully consistent policy, holds a negative attitude towards capitalism, and stirs up revolutions everywhere. Therefore, the Soviet Union uses this ingenious duality, making good use of the internal contradictions of various countries and the opposing relationships between nations. It previously used this to break through the great powers' blockade policy against Russia, and will use it in the future to complete its domestic construction. Japan, on the one hand, wants to use the Soviet Union to contain the United States of America's equal opportunity policy, and on the other hand, fears the Third International inciting the society within Japan’s militarism that is on the verge of collapse. Therefore, Japan is instigating the puppet state to conclude a "Non-Aggression Treaty" with the Soviet Union, placing the so-called first line of defense in North Manchuria, so that it can reap the benefits. The skill of diplomatic design lies in making good use of the enemy's strengths and compensating for one's own weaknesses. Its recent use of troops along the Chinese Eastern Railway and its plan to invite Red Army officers to participate in guidance are particularly effective means of appeasing the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union has always been aware of Japan's deep intentions and understands that the so-called "Manchukuo" is merely a puppet of Japan. Why, then, does it not hesitate to negotiate with it? The reason for this lies in what the Russian Karl Radek said in his assessment of the International Commission of Inquiry's report: "The Commission wants to unite world imperialism and Japanese imperialism to resist the Soviet Union, on the one hand provoking Japan to intensify its opposition to the Soviet Union, and on the other hand deliberately leaving a way out, attempting to draw the Soviet Union into the anti-Japanese front..." From this, we can see what the Soviet Union's true intentions towards Japan are. The reason why it does not hesitate to negotiate with the puppet state and proposes that the "Non-Aggression Treaty" must be jointly agreed upon by the Soviet Union, Japan, and the puppet state before it can be established lies in the following aspects:</p>
<p>First, the Japanese authorities' desire to annex the three northeastern provinces is obvious and undeniable. The current attempt to use some Chinese traitors to establish the so-called "Manchukuo (puppet) State" is merely out of concern for the sudden outbreak of international disputes. Therefore, the Soviet Union takes advantage of this weakness of the Japanese to propose that the Soviet Union, Japan, and the puppet state conclude a "Non-Aggression Treaty," in order to break part of Japan's mainland policy and make it inconvenient for Japan to immediately implement the annexation of "Manchuria."</p>
<p>Second, although the Soviet Union's interests along the Chinese Eastern Railway have not been immediately encroached upon, they have indeed been greatly threatened. The Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway has already cut off the Chinese Eastern Railway's military and political value. The Japanese military's first line of defense against Russia will shift from the Changchun area to the Xing'an Mountains area. Therefore, Siberia is also at risk of being invaded. Therefore, in order to secure its borders, the Soviet Union is using the "Non-Aggression Treaty" to dismantle Japan's military defense in North Manchuria, which is of great benefit to the development of Siberia.</p>
<p>Third, the conflict between the United States and Japan is becoming increasingly acute, which need not be reiterated. If the Soviet Union and Japan (puppet) openly conclude a "Non-Aggression Treaty," it would be tantamount to directly fueling the conflict between Japan and the United States, making Japan more forceful in its war preparations and provoking a struggle between Japan and the United States, thereby breaking Japan's diplomatic policy of using the Soviet Union and exposing its own shortcomings.</p>
<p>However, Japan is not foolish and is fully aware of the Soviet Union's true intentions. Therefore, it only mentions "Soviet-Manchurian non-aggression" and excludes Japan itself. The Soviet Union insists that Japan must join. It is feared that the standoff between the two will become one of the most central and difficult problems to solve in East Asian diplomacy. In the future, when the Pacific is completely settled, the outcome of this matter will inevitably be used to predict the future.</p>
<p>Our country is one of the three corners of the Northeast relationship. The Soviet Union and Japan are both close neighbors. The loss of the Northeast is particularly related to life and death. At a time when the Soviet Union and Japan are fiercely engaged in intrigue and the United States insists on not recognizing the doctrine of armed seizure, it is indeed a new turning point in diplomacy. If we can take advantage of the situation to save ourselves, it is not too late to mend the fence even after the sheep have been lost.</p>

<p>(Chengdu) Liu Wenhui ordered the garrison in Shunqing on the 18th to withdraw to Suining, showing concession. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

(19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) Deng Xihou decided to lead Huang Yin's troops out of the province to Suining within days to implement armed mediation. Currently, the 28th Army has concentrated eight brigades in Suining, Anyue, and Jianyang. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Wu Peifu telegraphed to the generals in Sichuan, saying that he heard of recent discord in Sichuan, which caused him great concern. He hoped that the gentlemen would understand national affairs, consider the suffering of the Sichuan people, be alarmed by foreign troubles, strive for harmony, and jointly save the country from danger. They should share weal and woe and should not have this. He respectfully expressed his feelings and hoped for tolerance. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhennian Expresses Acceptance of Central Government Orders</h3>
<p>His Troops Temporarily Stationed in Five Counties of Yexian and Laiyang</p>
<p>Han Fuqu Still Has Not Telegraphed to Nanjing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 19th, He Yingqin telegraphed Han and Liu, ordering them to retreat to their original defenses and await disposal. Yang Licuan, Liu Zhennian's representative stationed in Nanjing, said that Liu had already accepted the Central Government's order and his troops were temporarily stationed in the five counties of Yexian and Laiyang, awaiting resolution. Han, however, had not yet telegraphed to Nanjing. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Erzang and others, representatives of public groups from Yexian, Laiyang, Qixia, Penglai, Wendeng, and Rongcheng counties, telegraphed to the government and the Military Council, urging them to use effective methods to stop the Shandong war and strictly order Chairman Han to move troops to suppress bandits and resist Japan. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian telegraphed his representative stationed in Nanjing, saying that Han's troops were still using various types of artillery in a mixed bombardment of Yecheng, with more than 2,000 rounds per day, causing civilian casualties and destroying many houses. His army, in order to comply with the Central Government's orders, had strictly ordered its subordinates not to retaliate. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Xiang, Han Fuqu's representative, said that after the telegram order from Minister He to resolve the Shandong affair was issued, Han had not yet received a response here. However, Han hoped that the Central Government would have a second step of thorough resolution for the Shandong affair, so that there could be long-term stability. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Shajiahe: The Yantai-Weixian highway was previously blocked by Yexian. Now, the provincial army is building a new road north of Yecheng overnight, more than seventy li long, to connect with Longkou and directly reach Yantai. Zhang and Gu Liangmin arrived in Shajiahe today at Weishi. Zhang said that this trip was specifically to inspect the situation between Yantai and Weixian. Chairman Han originally intended to come in person, but he was too busy, so he sent us as representatives and will report the inspection to Jinan on the 21st and return to Jinan within days. According to recent refugees who escaped from Yecheng, Liu's army is running out of food and is extremely panicked. They are thinking of taking the opportunity to break out and are currently digging tunnels in the Ninth Middle School towards the southeast of the city. Judging from the soil dug out, they have dug a lot and are collecting wood to cushion the trenches when they break out. Liu's cavalry regiment of about 800 men dispersed near Titi after starting from western Yantai. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Weixian: The situation of the Jiaodong war was quite tense a few days ago. Since Jiang Bocheng proposed the Central Government's final mediation proposal on the 18th, Han Fuqu has expressed his agreement, and the situation has taken a sharp turn for the better. Han's army will lift the siege of Yexian and Laiyang around the 20th, and at the same time withdraw to its original defense west of the Wei River. Liu Zhennian's army will hand over Yexian and move to Laiyang. Before Han's army enters the city and Liu's army withdraws, the militia and the Public Security Bureau police will maintain law and order. How to deal with Liu's army is still kept secret. Judging from the situation around, it is roughly a compromise between Han and Liu, giving Liu the five counties of Zhifu, Longkou, etc., so as to achieve a peaceful resolution. (20th Electric Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Su Bingwen and Ma Zhanshan's Troops Join Forces to Attack Heihe</h3>
<p>Ma Zhanshan is Now in Taian Town</p>

Pu Bingshan took office as Deputy Commander of the National Salvation Army and Commander of the Eastern Route in Baiquan on the 14th, in order to jointly attack the provincial capital. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Xihe's Brigade Attacks the Enemy and Achieves Great Victory</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Xihe's brigade of Ma Zhanshan's troops destroyed a section of the Qiqihar-Keshan railway west of Taian Town to Yangjiatun on the 7th. His troops ambushed on the road. At 8 p.m., a Japanese troop train passed by and derailed at the destroyed section. Song's troops immediately launched a fierce attack, and the enemy retreated in great defeat to Laha Station. Song's troops continued to pursue and surrounded the station. Ma sent Xu Haiting to assist. Song's brigade killed more than ten enemies, captured 32, and seized more than 100 large and small guns, more than 100,000 rounds of ammunition, and a carload of supplies and military supplies. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Gong Lianshan Station of the National Salvation Army</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the National Salvation Army's Dong Rongzhi troops occupied the Nü'er River Station, more than a dozen Japanese planes bombed the camp every day and sent teams to disturb or threaten with machine guns and artillery. The local people requested the National Salvation Army to temporarily retreat. The army retreated to a certain place nearby on the morning of the 19th. The commander of the second brigade of the army, Wang Yongliang, led more than 3,000 troops to attack Lianshan Station. At dawn on the 19th, they engaged in a fierce battle with more than 800 Japanese troops at Lianshan. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The National Salvation Association Asks for Aid to the Righteous Army</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Xiong Xiling and others from the National Salvation Organizations Federation telegraphed to the Central National Government and overseas Chinese, asking for aid to the Righteous Army. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A Certain Central Committee Member's Opinion on the Report</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain Central Committee member, after the Commission of Inquiry's report was sent to the Central Committee, the Political Affairs Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Central Committee began to carefully study it and held many meetings. At first, there was a general discussion, and then a detailed study of the main points of Chapters IX and X of the report. The basis of this research and discussion was to strive for the integrity of our country's sovereignty and territory in the three northeastern provinces in accordance with public opinion, and at the same time to adapt to the international situation. Based on the above basis, any proposals or principles from which the proposals were derived that hindered the integrity of our country's sovereignty and territory were clearly stated as unacceptable. Some were considered to be internal affairs and should be dealt with independently, and reasonable counter-proposals were made. Some were intended to be accepted in principle within the scope of harmless sovereignty and territory, and other areas were also subject to considerable research. However, it was considered necessary to temporarily remain silent pending the League of Nations meeting. As for the investigative and observational parts contained in Chapter VIII and the previous chapters of the report, there were indeed errors, but on the whole, they were still considered fair. In this regard, in addition to the necessary statements, we not only do not want to criticize unreasonably like the Japanese side, but also recognize their painstaking efforts. However, the success or failure of diplomacy depends entirely on ourselves. There has never been a case where one can seek to invigorate others without first invigorating oneself. Therefore, our country, both upper and lower classes, should, on the one hand, seek ways to achieve diplomatic victory, and on the other hand, continue to actively seek to enrich our strength. Only then can we succeed. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Hu Shi said that his previous criticism of the report was public, so there was no need to reply to Zheng Luosheng's letter. As for their claim to be good friends with Puyi, it was even more of a joke. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wu Peifu said about the report that as a person in the opposition, he should not criticize this. However, he had a simple opinion. The Japanese military occupied the Northeast on September 18, and all the facts were very obvious. The authorities should take responsibility and should not rely solely on the League of Nations. Although the Commission of Inquiry's report was not without bias, it confirmed that the three northeastern provinces were our country's territory, which could be considered a fair statement. However, the Northeast is of no concern to the great powers. We can only recover our lost territory by seeking it ourselves. The diplomatic backing is military force. Without military force, there is no diplomacy. When someone occupies our territory, we can only drive them out with military force. Recovering lost territory with conditions will result in giving the land and sovereignty to the enemy. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tibetan Side Conscripts Troops to Prepare to Invade Yushu Again</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Xining Electric Report: Zha Wu, the commander of the Suman garrison, reported that Tibetan troops were conscripting troops on a large scale in their stationed areas and would invade Yushu again.

<h3>Wu Chaoshu Arrived in Beiping Yesterday</h3>

Wu said that this trip was of a tourist nature. After visiting the Forbidden City and other famous scenic spots, he went to Datong to visit the Yungang Grottoes. The overall criticism of the Report of the Commission of Inquiry could be said to be adding a dog's tail to a sable coat. The previous chapters on the factual part, like the fair trial of a judge, were still satisfactory. As for the recommendations, they were all the attitudes of diplomats who were all-rounders and considerate in every way, which made us difficult to be satisfied. In short, we must work hard on diplomacy with Japan and not rely on others, such as increasing the strength of the military, economic severance, and resisting goods, all of which are for the people to do.

<h3>Russian Newspaper Reports British Attempt to Establish Great Tibet</h3>
<p>Japan Abandons Anti-Dalai Lama Policy</p>
<p>Hoping Britain Will Tacitly Approve Japanese Annexation of the Northeast</p>
<p>Moscow, 19th (National News Agency) Today's Soviet Russian newspapers all carry a message stating that the British are conspiring to expand the Dalai Lama's power, so that in the future they can emulate Japan's precedent in Manchuria and establish a vast Tibetan state. It also says that the Japanese have always secretly supported the Dalai Lama's enemies, but now they will abandon this policy, hoping that the British will tacitly approve their annexation of Manchuria. Although the newspapers in Moscow today all carry this message, apart from calling it a "reference to the Lytton Report" and commenting on it,</p>
<h3>The United States' Far East Policy Group Is Passive</h3>
<p>Temporarily Adopting a Silent Attitude Toward the East Province Incident</p>
<p>Simultaneously Contacting Britain and France in Other Areas</p>
<p>Predicting Japan's Asian Continentalism Will Fail</p>
<p>The Fundamental Policy of the United States Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The World News Agency translated a New York special telegram from the English version of the Chicago Daily News, saying that the US government now has a situation of changing its Far East policy, turning from an active attitude to a passive attitude. According to information obtained from people close to the State Department, the US government seems unlikely to issue any active statement on the Manchurian issue before the League of Nations General Assembly on November 14. Secretary of State Stimson's repeated warnings have not only failed to restrain Japan but have instead given Japan great stimulation, making its attitude even tougher. Regarding the actions of the League of Nations, Japan is now regarded as showing more contempt for the US than for Britain or France. Stimson's actions have greatly strained US-Japanese relations, causing Americans to fear that another mistake could lead to a real dispute. Thus, Stimson's policy has completely failed in the eyes of Americans. The American public feels that the Japanese nation is now causing the country to solidify its defense in the Far East with Pan-Asianism. It is feared that the US alone cannot be Japan's enemy in the West Pacific. The strongest resistance to Stimson's policy is Wall Street's opposition to a US-Japanese conflict. The State Department's current inability to remain silent is due to three reasons: the failure of its Far East policy, the comparative weakness of the US Navy, and the financial difficulties of the US. As long as these three reasons exist, the State Department will likely remain silent for the time being. At the same time, Stimson may take other actions in other areas, such as attempting to combine with Britain and France. Regarding this point, the US may not take the initiative but will try its best to move the League of Nations. If Britain or France initiates it, the US will immediately respond. This kind of policy in the State Department seems to be deeply understood by US diplomats overseas, but among the US public opinion and industry leaders, they believe that Japan's Greater Asianism will inevitably fail because Japan's economic situation does not allow it. They believe that once this Japanese doctrine fails, the US will not need to exert effort, and the goals it pursues will be achieved naturally. It is now believed that the State Department also takes this view. Under these circumstances, it is in the cards that the State Department will temporarily remain silent and take action in other areas. However, it must be known that the United States' current change in its Far East policy is only a change in its method. Its fundamental policies of protecting US interests in the Far East and stopping Japan's territorial expansion will not change in the end. However, policies regarding Philippine independence, advances in Far East commerce, and relations with Hawaii may have some minor changes.</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Refutes the Absurdity of Japanese Propaganda</h3>
<p>Japanese Warlords Control Politics</p>
<p>Especially Enough to Cause a Serious Global Situation</p>
<p>Williamsburg, 19th (National News Agency) Dr. Shi Zhaoji said in a speech to the International Society here today that the Sino-Japanese Manchurian dispute is a threat to the world's orderly international relations. Judging from Japan's refusal to comply with the will of the League of Nations, a fundamental problem has arisen in this dispute, namely, the effectiveness of the League of Nations as a tool for peace. Shi recounted the origins and facts of the Sino-Japanese conflict caused by Manchuria, and refuted the Japanese claim that China's internal affairs were unruly and therefore Japan's military action was justified, declaring that if a powerful country's civilian power cannot control foreign policy and military actions, then its seriousness to the world situation is more than ten times that of a weak government with internal disorder.</p>

<p>Speed 19 Knots Per Hour</p>
<p>Equipped with Large-Caliber Guns for Combat</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Dentsu News Agency) Within the scope of the London Naval Disarmament Treaty, the Navy will build another first-class submarine, which was ordered to be built at the Sasebo factory on the 18th. The submarine has a displacement of 1,638 tons, a total length of 97 meters, a speed of 19 knots, 13cm guns, and six torpedo launchers. It is an excellent ship equipped with other important attack capabilities. It is scheduled to be completed in 1935.</p>
<h3>Japanese Charge d'Affaires in Russia Visits Karakhan</h3>
<p>Requesting Protection for Japanese Residents in Manzhouli</p>
<p>Moscow, 20th (National News Agency) The Japanese charge d'affaires here today visited Karakhan, the acting Foreign Affairs Commissioner, and discussed the Manchurian situation at length. It is said that the Japanese charge d'affaires requested the Soviet Union to protect Japanese residents in Manzhouli, and Karakhan agreed to forward this matter to the Soviet local authorities for attention.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy to Germany Summoned Home</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (National News Agency) According to the latest news obtained by the Japanese Embassy, it has been proven that the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Obata, has received a summons from the Tokyo government to return home and is scheduled to depart for home in early November. It is also said that Obata's return home is to attend an important diplomatic meeting in Tokyo and will soon return to Germany to resume his post. It is rumored that Obata will be appointed to an important position in the puppet state of Manchukuo, but nothing has been heard here yet. Whether Obata intends to accept this is still uncertain.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Municipal Electric Railway Strike</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Japan Federation News) After the Tokyo Municipal Electric Railway Bureau strike occurred, the Electric Railway Bureau authorities were very nervous, calling all staff to monitor the actions of the Transportation Labor Union. The Tokyo Military Police Captain visited the Electric Railway Bureau Chief this morning due to the severity of the case and listened to the strike situation. Military police intervention in strike issues has never happened before, and the future of this case is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Discover Communist Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Reuters) The police arrested three robbers in the robbery case of the Omori Local Bank in the suburbs of Tokyo, thereby discovering a Communist conspiracy. Subsequently, a large number of Communists and extremists were arrested in Tokyo, Osaka, and other places. According to police authorities, the group intended to cause trouble throughout the country on the anniversary of the Russian October Revolution, planning to damage arsenals, police stations, and military and political agencies, and to attack prisons with weapons to release prisoners. A certain Communist organization, upon the order of the Central Executive Committee presiding over the Red movement in Japan, solicited donations and collected military weapons and ammunition in various places to carry out this action. The police's words are not entirely believed, but there must be a reason for it. The authorities have now made various preparations to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3>Cancellation of the Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Russia Intends to Retaliate Against Britain</p>
<p>Germany and the United States Will Benefit First</p>
<p>Moscow, 20th (Reuters) The Russian authorities are very surprised by Britain's decision to cancel the Anglo-Russian trade agreement. They are not yet willing to make any criticism of Britain's move. British people in Moscow predict that Anglo-Russian trade will be greatly affected after the cancellation of the agreement. During the Ottawa Conference, Russian newspapers stated that if trade with Russia were discriminated against, Russia would retaliate. It is likely that Russia will use retaliation as a fundamental argument when discussing a new trade agreement with Britain in the future.</p>
<p>Washington, 19th (National News Agency) American statisticians estimated today that the trade lost by the United States due to the Ottawa Imperial Conference can easily be recovered by Britain's cancellation of the Anglo-Russian trade agreement. If the United States could recognize Soviet Russia sooner, its export trade could increase by 50 million yuan annually. Now that the British have cancelled the agreement, most of the profits will immediately belong to German merchants. If given more time, German manufacturers will dominate the Soviet Russian market in the future, and others will find it difficult to compete. If American merchants continue to sell goods to the Russians through British intermediaries, it is difficult to expect an immediate increase in US-Russian trade.</p>
<h3>No Date Set for the World Economic Conference</h3>
<p>Ottawa, 20th (Reuters) According to sources from the government here, the date of the World Economic Conference will be decided in November. The general opinion is that the conference will be held in January of next year, but everything depends on the results of negotiations between the British government and other governments. According to correspondence regarding this issue, the reason why the date has not been agreed upon is partly due to the issue of US representatives attending. If there are any changes in the US government, the President may consult with the Vice President on the organization of the US delegation.</p>

<h3>Yugoslav Shipyard to Change Hands</h3>
<p>France Plans to Invest in Expansion</p>
<p>Italy Greatly Disturbed</p>
<p>Rome, 19th (National News Agency) According to reports, the Split shipyard in Yugoslavia will change hands and will reportedly be managed by a certain French shipyard. The new owner will expand the factory with French capital to become an important base for the French fleet, and will build warships, especially focusing on submarines. This move will directly and indirectly harm Italy's position in the Adriatic Sea and is in line with France's post-war policy of using political and military alliances and other actions to contain Germany and Italy. Italians are greatly disturbed after reading this.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Passes Chancellor's Motion</h3>
<p>Discussing Ottawa Agreements Together</p>
<p>So That Congressional Meeting Time Can Be Saved</p>
<p>London, 19th (Havas News Agency) Chancellor Chamberlain put forward a motion regarding the procedures to be adopted by the House of Commons when discussing the Ottawa Agreements. The House overwhelmingly passed it. The four resolutions on the Ottawa Agreements will be studied as a whole by Congress.</p>
<h3>Eastern Newspaper Comments on the Ottawa Agreement</h3>
<p>Saying Britain Not Only Will Not Benefit</p>
<p>But Will Also Fall Into a Position of Isolation</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Reuters) Japan's most influential Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun today published an editorial criticizing the Ottawa Agreement, saying that Britain's selfishness and recklessness are shocking. Britain will not only not benefit from this agreement, but will also fall into a position of isolation. Today, the world powers all know that the only way to restore normal world economic conditions is to reduce tax rates. The agreement will inevitably destroy world peace and will betray Britain's ambition to promote disarmament.</p>
<h3>Formation of the Luo Xin Cabinet</h3>
<p>Tătărescu Continues as Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Former Premier Vaida Not Included in New Cabinet</p>
<p>Reuter's, Rome, 20th - The leader of the National Peasants' Party, Maliu, has completed the organization of the cabinet. The list of its key members is as follows: Premier Maliu, Deputy Premier Mironescu, Foreign Minister Tătărescu, Interior Minister Miciarachi, Finance Minister Mai Tega Lu, Industry and Commerce Lu Gu Qiao Nuo. The new cabinet will be sworn in before the King at 1 PM.</p>
<p>National Society, Rome, 19th - King Carol of Romania has again requested Professor Maliu to assist in state affairs, so that Romania can steadily overcome financial and political difficulties. Maliu has formed a new cabinet today, with Tătărescu as the Foreign Minister. This cabinet change can be called a victory for Tătărescu and the King of Romania. However, with the national treasury empty, the finances riddled with holes, and borrowing money difficult, many believe that their victory may not last long. Moreover, the King of Romania is one who can share adversity. He often asks Maliu to govern when state affairs are thorny, and once the difficulties are overcome, he immediately dismisses him. Therefore, it is expected that even if the new cabinet can cope with financial difficulties, it may not be in office for long. However, Tătărescu's foreign policy is diametrically opposed to France's policy regarding the issue of Romania and Russia concluding a non-aggression treaty. It is predicted that this change of Romanian cabinet will have significant consequences. Furthermore, the fact that former Premier Vaida has not joined the new cabinet shows that the ruling party is already greatly divided.</p>
<h3>Mexico's Overture to Restore the Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Nationalization of All Gold Mines</p>
<p>National Society, New York, 19th - It is believed here that the Mexican government's move to bring some of the most important gold mines in the country under state control is further evidence that Mexico will soon restore the gold standard. According to a Mexican government order, starting Saturday, gold mines will be nationalized. For example, the gold-producing centers such as San Miguel, Pilas, and Suilok Kroladu in the state of Oaxaca will all be owned by the federal government. However, those already mined by private individuals will continue to be protected, but no new mines will be allowed to be exploited by private individuals thereafter. The Mexican Ministry of Finance had just announced the Mexican President's order to purchase domestic gold and store it in the Bank of Mexico a few days ago. Now, less than a month later, it has issued the order to nationalize gold mines, which shows that the Mexican government is currently preparing to restore the gold standard.</p>
<h3>Organization of the Sino-Italian Association in Rome</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Rome, 20th - A group of Italians and Chinese have decided to organize a Sino-Italian Association in Rome to promote cultural ties between the two countries, so that the Chinese can understand Italy and the Italians can understand China.</p>
<h3>Hindenburg Stumbles but is Not Injured</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Berlin, 19th - Rumors that President Hindenburg fell and was injured are incorrect. A week ago, the president was walking on wetlands and slipped, but he was not injured.</p>
<h3>Belgian Authorities Hate Buddhism</h3>
<p>English Monk Zhao Kong Deported</p>
<p>National Society, Brussels, 19th - The foreign monk Lincoln, formerly known as an international explorer, whose Chinese name is Zhao Kong, entered Belgium from Germany today. However, after disembarking in Brussels, the Belgian capital, he was immediately arrested by the authorities and escorted out of the country by four detectives, returning to Germany. The reason why the Belgian authorities had to arrest Zhao Kong is unknown. Zhao Kong was still a monk at Jing'an Temple in Shanghai two months ago. A few days ago, he went to Berlin, the capital of Germany, and was warmly welcomed by the local Buddhist Association. He had preached there many times. Later, the Buddhist Association in Beijing heard of his name and invited him to Beijing. Zhao Kong immediately packed his bags and set off, but unexpectedly he was not tolerated by the Belgian authorities. It is said that the Belgian authorities told Zhao Kong that the people of Belgium do not believe in the Buddhist teachings he preaches and do not need to preach to them.</p>
<h3>During the Shanghai War, Japanese Soldiers Feared Death and Deserted</h3>
<p>Robbing Chinese Civilians</p>
<p>Sentenced to Twenty Years in Prison</p>
<p>The World News Agency reported that, according to the Eastern News, Zhu San Denan, a private first class of the 3rd Company, 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment, Toyama Infantry Regiment, 9th Division, deserted during the Shanghai War on March 2 this year when the 9th Division opened fire in Shanghai, abandoning military supplies and entering Chinese civilian homes, committing more than ten burglaries. He was interrogated by the 9th Division Military Court. The chief prosecutor requested an eight-year prison sentence. As a result, the presiding judge, Kamiya, sentenced him to twenty years in prison. It was said that when he deserted, he was waiting for orders. As a soldier, committing this act of destroying the spirit of a soldier should have been punished with the death penalty. Because the soldier had previously made small achievements, the sentence was changed to a first-class sentence, so he was sentenced to twenty years in prison.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>After the Outbreak of the Sichuan War (Continued)</h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui Asks for Peace from Allied Forces The total number of troops in Sichuan is more than 380,000. Liu Wenhui's troops account for only more than 110,000, which is difficult to cope with the attack of more than 270,000 troops. Therefore, he sent his brother Liu Xiusheng to Chongqing to ask Liu Xiang not to launch a war, and to ask the Allied forces for peace. He is willing to cede nine counties of the defense zone to the Allied forces for public garrison. Liu Dao, due to clan relations, has the intention to agree, but other armies do not approve and insist that Liu Wenhui must cede 30 counties of the defense zone. The two sides are still negotiating, so the war is not very intense at present. However, the Allied forces insist on 30 counties, and Liu Wenhui is determined not to agree under any circumstances. The Sichuan War is inevitable.</p>
<p>Generals Negotiate Peace to Govern Sichuan Since the war has expanded, the two-tiered generals of the Allied forces, such as the commanders of divisions and brigades of the 21st Army, 28th Army, 29th Army, 20th Army, Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Defense Army, Li Jiayu, and Luo Zezhou (excluding the commanders of divisions and brigades of the 24th Army), led by Tang Shizun, issued a circular stating that since 1911, the Sichuan chaos has been cyclical, with almost no peaceful years. The army has increased day by day, the need for funds has increased significantly, donations and taxes are heavy, and loans are numerous. People's production is limited, and the supply is endless. As a result, rural areas are bankrupt, industries are unemployed, education is abandoned, and commerce is declining. The parties involved have tried every means to collect taxes, but the supply of troops is still difficult. If this continues, the consequences will be unimaginable. At this time, the violent sun is rampant, Tibetan and Yi tribes are invading the border, and the Communists are expanding. Disasters are coming together. Heaven's will and human affairs are even more alarming. For the sake of saving the Sichuan situation, the generals have discussed and drafted 16 articles on governing Sichuan. They also ask the public to come to Suining to stop the war and revise various plans based on this outline, and submit them to the central government for implementation as soon as possible. (1) The armies pledge to be sincere, break the defense zone system, cooperate effectively, unify the entire Sichuan, and urgently seek construction, using the entire force to solve the country's disputes, resist foreign insults, and solidify the border, without following the old path of mutual jealousy and changing with the overall situation of Sichuan. Break the situation manipulated by cunning people. (Note: It seems to refer to Liu Wenhui, that is, the generals unite to overthrow Liu). (2) Sichuan has been without a government for a long time, and the armies do not yield to each other, and mutual trust is not established. Now, for the sake of seeking perfection and eliminating disasters, in addition to applying central laws, a mutual guarantee governance system is also established as a temporary guideline for the transitional era, so that in various situations, understanding and reconciliation can be achieved easily. (3) Factionalism has caused great harm to Sichuan. Many talents in the province have been abandoned. From now on, all barriers should be broken, and all talents should be included and used, and the bad habit of using county offices as rewards should be abolished. The examination system should be implemented, classified and selected, so that all kinds of talents have the opportunity to advance. The narrow societies organized in the past and the policies of foolish people adopted are all abolished. (4) The armies in Sichuan have increased their strength due to mutual precautions, so the number of soldiers and military strength have increased rather than decreased. The people's strength is insufficient, and the authorities are also running out of tricks. If this is not changed, there will be no benefit. All departments should thoroughly understand and eliminate the attitude of hostility. Build achievements for the country, not offset them in the province. (5) Sichuan has been in turmoil for many years, and the discipline has been lost. If there is anyone who wants to seek undue advantages, and buy troops to reward chaos and show off their strength, they will be jointly denounced in order to rectify the atmosphere. (6) The number of soldiers in Sichuan is too large, and the armies should reduce the establishment in proportion. The salaries and regulations must be unified, and redundant personnel and expenses must be reduced in order to save expenses. (7) After the compilation, establish a budget, and all illegal taxes, donations, and loans must be abolished in stages within the possible scope, and strive to achieve one tax per year and exempt all harsh taxes before stopping. (8) During the period when the army is not used, reduce the standing army to a minimum, so that the young men can return to their hometowns and increase the production capacity of the locality. At the same time, improve the militia system and give them strict training in their spare time, so that they can be called up quickly in case of emergency. (9) Use part of the funds saved from disarmament to prepare for national defense, so as to supplement the central government's shortcomings. (10) Thoroughly publicize military, civilian, and financial affairs, eliminate the habits of private monopoly, and give the leaders and personnel of various departments and the public of parties and associations the opportunity or position to participate, so as to seek governance together. (11) Educational construction and other policies must be thoroughly handled, and progress should be evenly made with military and civilian policies. The various agencies can sincerely implement their functions, and their expenses should be effectively guaranteed. The army should no longer have the act of occupying, extracting, and controlling. (12) Gather various specialized talents, establish various committees, formulate various construction plans, and guide their progress, so as not to make them lean towards the military and violate their strengths. (13) The border areas of Sichuan, such as Sichuan, Kangningyuan, Leimaping, Songli, etc., are waiting to be reclaimed. The armies gather in the interior, and they are in distress, so they should be divided into several groups and sent to reclaim the land in order to maximize the use of the land and consolidate the border. (14) The departments' exchanges with the central government and other provinces should not be different. The representatives sent in the past should be withdrawn uniformly, and the ruling authorities should be responsible for handling them, so as to have a unified view and unified steps. (15) If there is anyone who uses private interests, wants to scrape Sichuan, create a unique army, and violates the principles of this outline, they will be abandoned by everyone. (16) Some of the above articles are inconsistent with the current laws and regulations of the central government, but because the Sichuan situation is complicated, it is difficult to realize it without slightly changing it. Once the various policies are in order and there are no obstacles, they will still be handled in accordance with the regulations of the central government.</p>
<p>The Suining Conference is the Key to Peace and War Although the above articles have now been passed by the second-tier generals of the Allied forces, what are the opinions of Liu Xiang, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, Deng Xihou, and Liu Cunhou? It remains to be decided at the Suining Conference. At present, Suining is preparing to welcome the military leaders of various armies to gather there for consultation. At the same time, Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army is also willing to abide by the 16 articles and is now sending telegrams to the generals, requesting to join the signature. Liu is also preparing to participate in person in the Suining Conference and consult with the generals. Therefore, whether the Sichuan situation will be peaceful and whether the war will expand will depend on the situation of the Suining Conference. (October 15)</p>
<h3>Dai Jitao's Opinion on the Sichuan Rebellion</h3>
<p>Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, made the following statement yesterday regarding the Sichuan issue: "Recently, because the country is in great difficulty and internal strife has risen again, especially Sichuan, which is a large and rich place, is closely related to the safety of the country and the merchants in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Therefore, all Chinese people are paying close attention and hoping that the disputes will end soon. I was born in Sichuan, and the tombs of my ancestors and parents are all there. For more than ten years, I have done my best for Sichuan affairs as far as my personal ability allows. Whenever a war breaks out, even though I know that what I do is ineffective, I will do my best to persuade, but because of the lack of sincerity and trust, there has never been any effect, which is extremely ashamed. I remember that in the winter of 1922, I was ordered by the Premier to enter Sichuan to persuade the armies to stop internal strife and develop industries. Before it was sent from Hushan, the Premier invited no less than dozens of Sichuan fellow villagers in Shanghai. During the dinner, he bitterly described the harm of internal strife to the public and private sectors, and asked everyone to do their best to persuade. Afterwards, he also sent out a telegram of more than a thousand words, every word was poignant and every word was practical. The result was that none of the Sichuan military generals paid any attention to it. In 1928, the Sichuan generals also fought for defense zones. At that time, it was during the national unification and the establishment of the capital. The military and political leaders from the north and south of the country gathered in the capital for the plenary session. Therefore, the General Assembly appointed a committee to review the Sichuan case. In addition to Mr. Hu Hanmin, Gu Yingfen, Chen Guofu, Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, Li Zongren, He Jingzhi, and I also participated in the final deliberation. At that time, the committee deliberated three times before making a resolution, and then asked the General Assembly to submit it to the National Government, ordering the military generals in Sichuan to abide by it. It was truly what is called tearful. At that time, it was thought that since the country had been unified, it would not be difficult to settle Sichuan. The methods contributed by the central government were already reasonable and reasonable to the extreme. As long as the generals took the national pulse and people's lives to heart, or even if they only took their own future into consideration, they would be willing to compromise and listen to the advice of the central government. However, after the order was issued, it was still ineffective. Today's affairs are not special, although the parties involved may hold their own opinions, but it is nothing more than a repetition of private struggles, and the so-called economic problems, transportation problems, administrative problems, etc., although the words are very common, the meanings are strange and far-fetched, and only make the people feel heartbroken. Those who have the country and the people in their hearts will not bear to use these topics completely as objects of private struggle. The newspaper has reported in recent days that the central government intends to send me to Sichuan to mediate. I have not heard of this. I used to devote a little effort to Sichuan affairs, but each time it was ineffective. The two times mentioned above are the most prominent. Who can match the Premier in the leader's belief in ability? Even if the central government organizes another committee, it will not be as easy as the meeting in 1928 to convene leaders from the north and south of the country. Even if the worthy person is ordered to be the peacemaker, it will not be easy to do. In short, the Sichuan affair is not about whether to fight this time or not, whether to make peace this year or not, but whether there is a stable and improved way for the future of Sichuan politics. In my opinion, the stability and improvement of Sichuan politics is as easy as turning one's hand. It only depends on whether the current military leaders are willing to change their minds or not. The power and responsibility are completely in the hands of the five or seven soldiers in charge. Although the chaos in Sichuan has a long history and its relationship is very complicated, under the current circumstances, as long as five or seven soldiers thoroughly realize it, all horizontal environment and vertical history can be cut off and started anew. I also don't think they are evil and hopeless sinners. In ancient times, there were many great and evil people who, once they changed their minds, became saints and sages and established great achievements. For example, Ashoka of India, whose crimes in the early days were worse than Qin Shi Huang. He killed his father, imprisoned his mother, and killed his brothers. He regarded the lives and property of meritorious officials and people as worthless. However, once he realized it, he established India's unprecedented and unrepeatable unified civilization, and his achievements left to the world were higher and greater than those of the founding heroes of Eastern and Western countries. The crimes of the generals in Sichuan are less than one percent of those of Ashoka in the early days, so why is it impossible to change their ways? Therefore, the reason why it has been getting worse and worse for twenty years and has come to today is not because they are fierce, but because they have no courage, no ambition, do not admit their mistakes, and are unwilling to sacrifice a little personal interest. Speaking of the future methods, my opinion is extremely simple. What I contributed to the central government and the gentlemen in Sichuan three or five years ago is still unchanged, that is, the four words of ordinary and peace. The meaning of peace is very obvious and does not need to be explained. The meaning of ordinary is that all political systems in Sichuan must not be different from other provinces. They must be the same as other provinces. Follow the laws and regulations promulgated by the central government and organize a legal provincial government. The generals of the armies must respect the system of the provincial government and unite civil affairs and finance before there is a way. The procedures for its progress are very thorough as indicated by the order issued in 1928. It should still be fully followed as a criterion and earnestly implemented. In addition, no matter what special methods you think of, the more special it is, the greater the harm. As for how to make everyone change their minds and how to allocate work, this can only be discussed after the fundamental principles have been decided. If the fundamental principles are not established and only cleared from their so-called responsibilities and interests, then they will only go further and further and become more and more chaotic. The future of Sichuan is worrying enough to make people feel cold. If the generals of the armies do not realize it and engage in transformation, then the scope of the war will be larger and the unit of command will be smaller. The great generals will fall, and the small generals will divide the territory. The fall of the small generals will lead to mutinies and riots. The Communists have been cleared everywhere, but the disaster in Sichuan is just beginning. The tragedy of the late Ming Dynasty is a good example. As for the issues of Xikang and Tibet, the relationship with the Sichuan situation is even greater. I will contribute my views on it another day."</p>
<h3>Sichuan People in Beijing Ask to Stop the Sichuan War</h3>
<p>Since the news of the outbreak of the Sichuan War spread, the Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing has sent telegrams to the military authorities, urging them to value the overall situation and the people and stop the disputes, and organized a special committee to stop the Sichuan War, specializing in handling the work of quelling the war. Since its establishment, in addition to presenting it to the National Government and the Ministry of Military Affairs, requesting (1) strict orders to stop the Sichuan War, (2) strict orders to the armies not to create names and impose additional harsh levies, (3) stop issuing transportation passes for military supplies, and investigate and punish the perpetrators, it also convened representatives of various Sichuan armies stationed in Beijing on the 14th of this month to solicit the truth about the Sichuan situation. At the same time, it invited famous people from Sichuan in Beijing to exchange opinions, and also sent telegrams to Sichuan fellow villagers in other places to contact and act together. Now, the association believes that the Sichuan army not only does not listen to advice, but also actively uses troops, which shows that they not only have no people in their minds, but also no central government and no laws. Therefore, on the 18th, it sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek in Hankou, requesting him to use resolute means to strictly punish it. Yesterday, it also telegraphed the people of Sichuan, urging them to use force to stop the civil war. It is hoped that after these two telegrams are sent, the ambitions of the warlords may be slightly curbed. The two telegrams are recorded below.</p>
<p>Telegram to Chiang Kai-shek: To Chiang Kai-shek in Hankou, The generals in Sichuan disregard the national crisis and launch an internal strife. Although you have repeatedly telegraphed to dissuade them, and the Executive Yuan has also issued a clear order to cease the war, judging from the facts, all parties are bending their bows and mounting their horses, and the situation is becoming more tense. It seems that they are disobeying orders overtly and complying covertly, not only despising the laws and regulations, but also making foreigners laugh at them. We beg you to make a decisive decision and strictly punish them, and take prompt and effective measures to stop the war and settle the people. The 70 million elders and children in Sichuan will be infinitely fortunate. We humbly present this telegram with utmost respect and longing. The Special Committee to Stop the Sichuan War of the Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing.</p>
<p>Telegram to the People of Sichuan: All 70 million compatriots in Sichuan are aware that the country is in great difficulty, and it is urgent. All Chinese people should be diligent and concerned, unite with each other, and should not fight among themselves and destroy the country's destiny. Unexpectedly, the national crisis is getting deeper and the internal strife is getting fiercer. The struggle between Liu and Han in Qi and Lu has not stopped, and the armies in our Sichuan are meeting each other with swords and spears. It is found that Sichuan raises millions of soldiers and has six or seven powerful chiefs. The entire province is divided, like different countries. The more wars are fought, the more soldiers there are, and the commanders are separated and united from time to time, sometimes friends and sometimes enemies, sometimes peaceful and sometimes warlike. In short, the only thing that remains unchanged is to expand private interests, preserve strength, demand from the people, exploit the locality, impose exorbitant taxes and levies, and have prepaid money and grain for more than fifty years of the Republic of China. The wars are connected and the disasters are connected, and more than 400 wars have been staged in the province. The shuttles are empty and the Xingfa is exhausted. The government has no army to extinguish the fire and save the drowning, and the people have the pain of sucking marrow and knocking fat. What has Sichuan done to deserve this torture? Now, it is becoming even more aggravated, disregarding internal and external troubles, showing off their ferocity, engaging in battles for cities and land, weakening the preparations for resisting Japan, giving international excuses, opening up the hearts of the Tibetan and Tibetan tribes, and giving opportunities to the Red bandits. If they are launched and spread, it will be enough to involve the overall situation in the northwest and southwest, and form a serious situation in China's future. Once the country and the province are destroyed, can the warlords eat their flesh? The members of this association feel deeply and cannot remain silent. In addition to presenting it to the central government and sending telegrams to stop it as soon as possible, and contacting fellow villagers from other provinces to uphold justice and call for peace, we hope that the 70 million compatriots in Sichuan will immediately rise up, get rid of their cowardice, and seek a solution by themselves. Gather local militias, implement armed suppression, followed by strikes and boycotts, and finally resist losses and resist taxes, cut off their resources, and promote their self-destruction. We also hope that the armed comrades in the armies will realize it as soon as possible, do not covet a few yuan of salary, and provide sacrifices for them. At the same time, fathers call their sons and brothers call their younger brothers, so that they can leave the army, carry guns and return to the fields. Once the firewood under the cauldron is removed, the muddy glue will be corrected by itself. You must know that there are no melons on the Yellow Terrace, and there is no hair left on the defeated shoe. If you don't plan now, it will be too late to bite your navel. Rather than groaning under the iron hooves of the warlords to perish, why not die generously to seek life? If you can lead the way forward, this association promises to be your backing. I hereby present this telegram, and I hope you will be aware of it. The Special Committee to Stop the Sichuan War of the Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing. (19th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Bo-cheng Returns to Beiping</h3>
<p>Chiang Claims Provincial Troops Have Been Settled and Will Withdraw Defenses on the 20th</p>
<p>However, Han Indicates This Matter Still Requires Consideration</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After a month of disputes in the Ludong (Eastern Shandong) Incident, a solution, through repeated consultations between Chiang Bo-cheng and Han Fu-qu, is gradually approaching. Han indicated to Chiang this morning that he agreed to withdraw his troops back to their original defenses starting from the 20th (according to the regulations of the Post-War Settlement Outline, provincial troops should withdraw to the west of the Wei River, except for those stationed in Yantai and along the Yantai-Wei River line), awaiting central government disposal. The Ludong Incident seems to have reached a conclusion at this point. It remains to be seen how Liu Zhennian will act afterward. Chiang Bo-cheng, having accomplished a great task, plans to return to Beiping for a trip. He informed Han of this this morning. At 6:20 PM, Han sent Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang as his representative, along with key figures from the party, government, and military, to the station to see him off. After arriving at the station, Chiang shook hands with everyone and boarded the Beiping-Pukou Train No. 102, departing Jinan northward at 6:40 PM. Before Chiang's departure, I visited him at the Central Bank and inquired about everything. According to Chiang, "This morning, I visited Chairman Han and consulted with him on the Generalissimo's intentions. Han readily agreed to withdraw defenses first, awaiting central government disposal. At that time, he immediately ordered Chief of Staff Zhang Guoxuan to telegraph Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang, stationed in Weixian; the 29th Division Commander Cao Fulin, stationed in Yexian; and the 87th Brigade Commander Rong Guangxing, stationed near Laiyang, ordering them to completely withdraw all provincial troops from Laiyang and Yexian back to their original defenses starting from the designated date (the 20th). Simultaneously, telegrams were sent to Chiang Kai-shek in Hankou, President Song of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, Minister He of the Military Administration Department, and Director Zhang (Xueliang) in Beiping, as well as the Military Affairs Commission, stating the progress of withdrawing defenses in accordance with the order, awaiting central government disposal. The Ludong Incident has thus reached a conclusion. This morning, telegrams from Chairman Chiang and Minister He arrived, generally stating that they deeply admired Brother Han's (Han Fu-qu) willingness to compromise and tolerate, showing his deep concern for the country. I have already reported the details of the negotiations to the Generalissimo and Minister Bao. Fortunately, things have turned out well, and I plan to return to Beiping for a trip tonight." However, those who visited Han this morning reported that Han stated, "My original intention in sending troops to punish Liu was to relieve the people's suffering. Now that Liu Zhennian is not leaving, the people's suffering cannot be alleviated. To withdraw defenses hastily would allow Liu Zhennian to further poison the locality. I would truly be letting down the people. Therefore, the matter of withdrawing defenses still requires consideration." Chief Staff Officer Chiang came to talk to me yesterday, only saying at the time that Division Commander Cao (Fulin) should be withdrawn to Weixian, and if Liu Zhennian made no changes, Division Commander Cao should be stationed permanently in Weixian. This seems to be slightly different from what Chiang Bo-cheng said.</p>
<p>This time, the provincial troops attacking Liu were originally divided into two routes, one in Yexian and one in Laiyang. Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang was stationed in Weixian, coordinating everything. The forces in Yexian included the 86th Brigade of the 29th Division, commanded by Chen Dexin; the 85th Brigade, commanded by Li Hanzhang; a portion of the 222nd Brigade of the 74th Division, commanded by Ma Guanyi; the 66th Brigade of the 22nd Division, commanded by Li Zhanbiao; and the directly subordinate artillery regiment of the 29th Division, etc. The forces in Laiyang were the 87th Brigade of the 29th Division, commanded by Rong Guangxing, and the Ludong Militia, commanded by Zhao Mingyuan. In addition, the provincial troops that had arrived to take over defense of counties from which Liu's troops had withdrawn included the Lunan Militia, commanded by Xie Shuxian, stationed near Zhaoyuan and Laiyang; the 64th Brigade of the 21st Division, commanded by Ning Chunxiao, stationed in Fushan and Yantai; and the cavalry brigade, commanded by Li Xuande, stationed in Muping. As for the most recent situation at the front, according to a telegram from Shahe yesterday, Liu's troops in Yexian and Laiyang were still making provocative moves. Inside Yexian City, because the people's grain had been requisitioned early on, many people were starving to death. There were especially many suicides, with wells full of floating corpses, a truly unbearable sight. All of this was a result of the war. One can only wonder whether those involved can stop before it's too late. The original telegram is as follows: (1) The front has been extremely quiet for the past few days. Because the investigator and Liu's representative, Li Henghua, met twice in succession, both sides believed that a peaceful resolution was imminent, so the front defense lines have become relaxed, unlike the tension of previous days. The investigator left Shahe on the 13th. At dawn on the 14th, Liu's troops inside the city suddenly used heavy artillery to bombard the provincial troops' Ma Brigade positions south of the city, firing over a hundred shells, and the situation suddenly became serious again. The provincial troops retaliated with dozens of shells in the evening, but the front has been extremely quiet in recent days. (2) Grain and provisions are extremely scarce inside Yecheng. Soldiers receive grain rations on a pro rata basis every day, but the common people see not a single grain, and many are starving to death. Those unable to bear the hunger often hang themselves or jump into wells. Because no one is rescuing them, the wells are filled with corpses. In many cases, nine corpses are hanging from one tree, a scene that is horrifying to behold. The people have repeatedly requested that the city be opened to release them, but Liu has refused. (3) Du Enpu reported from Muping that a portion of Liu's troops, fleeing from Yexian to Rongcheng, requested that Tang Zaiting, the head of the local Red Cross Society, go to Muping to negotiate their surrender with Du. This unit currently consists of over three hundred soldiers and over two hundred guns. A certain battalion deputy will personally go to Muping to negotiate. (4) Rong Guangxing came to Shahe today to meet with Cao and talk. The Laiyang area is also quiet, but there are minor skirmishes between plainclothes teams at the front. When Fan Yuhuang arrived in Laiyang, Liu's troops were retreating in disarray, and a peaceful resolution had been reached. The next day, they still advanced to their original defenses, maintaining a strict defense. (October 18)</p>
<h3>Remnants of Chen Guohui's Troops Flee to Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>He Xianzhu Escapes from Putian</p>
<p>Fuzhou Taken Over by Training Corps</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After Chen Guohui's troops were intercepted by the 61st Division's Zhang Li Brigade of the 19th Route Army at the border of Yongchun and Xianyou, it is estimated that half of Chen's 1st Regiment was disarmed, one-third of the 2nd Regiment was disarmed, the 3rd Regiment was completely annihilated, and the remaining supplementary regiments and independent battalions were scattered and almost completely destroyed. Only over three thousand remnants, led by Chen Peiyu, the commander of the 2nd Regiment, fled into the mountains of Xishan and Shuikou, at the border of Xianyou and Dehua. The Zhang Li and Tan Qixiu Brigades of the 19th Route Army are still advancing from Xianyou and Yongtai to encircle them, ordering Chen Peiyu to hand over the troops to be reorganized by Hong Wende, the deputy brigade commander of that brigade, and reorganized into a supplementary regiment under the direct command of the 19th Route Army, otherwise they will be thoroughly suppressed to prevent them from causing harm to the region. After Chen's troops retreated from Xianyou County, the Chen Tong Regiment of the originally assigned Provincial Defense Army's 3rd Brigade was to be stationed there. Due to strong opposition from the people, the Huang Zhen Regiment of the Zhang Li Brigade was reassigned to take over the defense. Chen's regiment still returned to defend Putian. However, the complaints against He Xianzhu, the Deputy Brigade Commander of the Provincial Defense Army's 3rd Brigade, are also like a mountain. Since Chen Guohui was arrested in the province, he felt greatly uneasy. Later, as the 19th Route Army advanced into Xianyou, adjacent to Putian, he felt even more cramped. He suddenly disappeared the other day, reportedly taking funds, his wife, and children, escaping from Pinhai by French steamship to Taiwan. The order in Putian is very chaotic. The people also requested that the 19th Route Army send troops to take over the defense. It is heard that the Pacification Headquarters plans to order the Tan Qixiu Brigade, currently stationed in Yongtai, to send a regiment to station in Putian. Furthermore, because the counties of Jinjiang, Nan'an, Huian, Anxi, Dehua, Yongchun, Putian, and Xianyou in the prefectures of Quanzhou and Xinghua have suffered severely from the ravages of Chen and He's troops for years, the people are suffering unbearably. They plan to take this opportunity to convene a Xingquan Yong Pacification Conference on a fixed date, gathering representatives from all sectors of the party, government, gentry, and commerce in each county, to discuss all post-war matters in the region. At the same time, the people's organizations in the prefectures of Quanzhou and Xinghua have also launched and organized committees to investigate and confiscate the assets of rebels, to investigate and register the properties of Chen and He and their accomplices, and petition for their confiscation to be used for local public welfare. As for Chen Wei-yuan, the brigade commander of the Provincial Defense Army's 3rd Brigade, who went south from the province the other day with Hong Wende, the deputy brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, Chen has now arrived in Putian, and Hong has arrived in Yongchun. Chen immediately summoned Liang Jichuan and Chen Tong, the commanders of the two regiments under his command, and the battalion commanders of He Xianzhu's regiment (He served as the regiment commander concurrently as deputy brigade commander) to give them instructions, deciding to await the Pacification Headquarters' orders for reorganization and redeployment, and to block Chen Guohui's routed troops from fleeing into the territory. Therefore, there should be no problems on that front. After Hong Wende entered Yongchun, he also sent personnel to Dehua to negotiate the reorganization with Chen Peiyu. However, another part of Chen Peiyu's troops had already fled from Dehua into the mountains of Anxi to become bandits. The majority was led by Chen Peiyu to Datian County. Datian is located at the central hub of southern and northern Fujian, adjacent to the defense areas of Anxi and Youxi, where the newly formed 2nd Division of the Army, commanded by Lu Xingbang, is stationed. Lu's division has sent troops to the border areas to block them. It is heard that Chen Peiyu has requested to be incorporated into Lu Xingbang's command, but Lu has not yet replied.</p>
<p>The more than one thousand rifles and thirty machine guns seized from Chen's troops by the 19th Route Army in Xianyou, as well as the county magistrate Ye Zuyi and councilors Chen Changhou, captured in Nan'an, were escorted to the province on the 15th and handed over to the Pacification Headquarters for detention, awaiting the arrival of the special commissioner sent by the Central Military Commission to Fujian, who will then open the trial together with Chen Guohui. Furthermore, the various positions held by He Xianzhu, including Deputy Brigade Commander of the Provincial Defense Army's 3rd Brigade, Commander of the 3rd Regiment of that brigade, and concurrent positions as Director of the Putian Xianyou Post-War Affairs Office, were all dismissed by order of the provincial government on the 15th. The Putian Xianyou Post-War Affairs Office was abolished, and the vacancy of the 3rd Regiment Commander was filled by Chen Wei-yuan, the Brigade Commander of the same brigade, concurrently. At the same time, the troops of that brigade also withdrew from Putian County and the Hanjiang commercial port, heading to Guangye and Changtai. Troops from the 19th Route Army were dispatched from Xianyou to take over the defense. The Hanjiang Agricultural and Industrial Bank, opened by He Xianzhu, experienced a run on the bank. Unable to meet the withdrawals, it declared bankruptcy. It is heard that the bank owes a significant amount of debt. The Xinghua Native Place Association in the province has petitioned the provincial government and the Pacification Headquarters to confiscate He's property to compensate. Currently, the Pacification Headquarters has decided to move the Supplementary Brigade commanded by Tan Qixiu to Putian and Xianyou counties to form a line with the 61st Division commanded by Mao Weishou, stationed in Quanzhou. Fuzhou will be taken over by the Training Corps of the 61st Division. The corps departed from Quanzhou the other day and arrived in the province, stationed outside the east, west, and north gates. However, because assassination cases by the Iron Blood Corps have repeatedly been discovered in the provincial capital (most recently, the coal merchant Zhang Qiufan and the foreign cloth merchant Huang Shuige were killed), martial law has been declared, and the search for people privately storing weapons is extremely strict.

<h3>Hong Kong's Sai Kung Merchant Ship, "Da Zhonghua," Robbed En Route</h3>
<p>After Plundering, Pirates Escape Near Shanwei</p>
<p>Several Thousand Dollars Worth of Stolen Goods and Four Hostages Kidnapped</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: British warships have been patrolling the outer waters of Hong Kong recently, and even Paias Bay in Huizhou, Guangdong Province, has British warships anchored there, so the sea lanes have been peaceful for a time. Unexpectedly, with the arrival of winter recently, pirates have taken the opportunity to steal and commit crimes again. On the 20th of this month, news suddenly emerged that the merchant ship "Da Zhonghua," which travels between Hong Kong and Sai Kung, had been robbed. It is understood that the merchant ship is owned by the Hong Kong Wo Fat Shing Steamship Company, weighs 1,219 tons, was built by a Norwegian shipyard, and was purchased by Wo Fat Shing Company in 1929. It specializes in the Hong Kong-Sai Kung route. From Hong Kong to Sai Kung, it mainly carries passengers; from Sai Kung back to Hong Kong, it mainly carries rice and stones. In addition to the captain and chief engineer and other four people being foreigners, the crew numbers 76, and the chief and deputy compradors are both Cantonese. The ship departed from Hong Kong as usual at 7:30 PM on the 11th of this month, heading to Sai Kung, carrying a total of 357 passengers. All was peaceful after the ship started moving. However, at 5:00 PM on the 12th, as the ship was sailing on the open sea amidst turbulent waves, a gunshot suddenly rang out on the ship's gangway. A gang of about 15 robbers on the ship seized the engine room, rudder room, comprador's office, and radio station, and threatened the helmsman, forcing him to change the ship's route. The ship was originally heading south, but the robbers ordered it to turn east. After the robbers seized the various organs on the ship, they dispatched gangs to search the passengers' luggage and extensively search the ship's comprador to extort money. At this time, the chief comprador, Feng Huizhuang, had already changed clothes and secretly mingled with the sailors. The deputy comprador, Feng Naiqi, was discovered by the robbers, and he eventually collected HK$340 to offer to the robbers, and was then released. The robbers took turns searching the passengers' luggage four or five times, and all valuables, jewelry, and money were plundered, with the total value of the stolen goods exceeding HK$3,000. After the robbery, they were still not satisfied, so they resorted to kidnapping, selecting four passengers who appeared wealthy and abducting them. Those kidnapped were Zhao Zhuozhenting, Hong Yuji, Chen Jia, and Zhao Siming. The first three were from Chaozhou, and the latter was from Heshan County. During the kidnapping, two passengers, Hu Huifu and Yi, tried to escape in fear and jumped into the sea, swept away by the waves. Hu left behind a young daughter, Hu Yu. Afterwards, the crew sent the girl to the Hong Kong Police Station to await arrangements. After the robbers had plundered to their satisfaction, they were extremely leisurely, smoking opium on the deck or listening to records for entertainment. The robber chieftain seemed to have a pre-arranged plan, forcing the helmsman to steer the ship eastward, likely wanting to get closer to Shanwei harbor so that a pirate ship there could meet them, and prohibiting the ship from speeding. Midway, they even forced the crew to repaint the yellow smokestack black to confuse targets and prevent pursuit by warships. On the morning of the 13th, the ship had reached Shanwei, but the robbers did not want to go ashore during the day, ordering the ship to meander outside Shanwei harbor to waste time. It was not until about 1:00 AM at night that they allowed the ship to stop at Xu Xiequan Bay outside Shanwei harbor. At this time, a fishing boat was already there to meet them. The robbers left the "Da Zhonghua" in two batches. The first batch took the stolen goods and hostages, and the second batch forced the captain to see them off, using this to control the crew from attacking. After all the robbers had landed in the bay and left triumphantly, the captain and others had no choice but to watch them leave and return to the ship, ordering it to return to Hong Kong and report the case to the Hong Kong government. The ship arrived in Hong Kong at 10:00 AM on the 14th. The Hong Kong government immediately sent police detectives to the ship to investigate the details of the robbery and the lost goods and people. After the matter was concluded, the "Da Zhonghua" merchant ship set sail again for Sai Kung at 4:00 PM on the 14th. (October 15)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandit Work Plan Seized in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Authorities Order Active Prevention and Suppression of Local Communists</p>
<p>Pacification Headquarters to Postpone Abolishment During Winter Defense Period</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province has been extremely strict in preventing communism recently, so the rumors of a communist party plot to riot on Double Ten Day ultimately came to nothing. However, yesterday, the special detective team of the Public Security Bureau's Hong Kong Special Detective Office seized a bundle of communist bandit work plans, including "Resolution of the Communist Party's Pseudo-Central Committee on the Kuomintang's Fourth Encirclement Campaign and Our Tasks," "Letter from the Communist Party's Pseudo-Central Committee to the Party Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee, Yasu Soviet District," "Outline of the Report on Opposing the Kuomintang's Fourth Encirclement Campaign Against the Red Army," "Outline of the Report on Celebrating the New Victory of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army," four copies of the "Declaration of the Interim Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic International to Rescue Niu Lan," and "Outline of the Report on the Summary of the Soviet Union's First Five-Year Plan and the Second Five-Year Plan," in addition to many publications related to the communist bandits' work plans and propaganda inciting reaction. Yesterday, the detective chief Liang submitted the above six communist bandit publications and a summary of the content of the publications to the Provincial Public Security Bureau, which forwarded them to the provincial government and the headquarters of the First Group Army, ordering prevention and suppression to curb any disturbance. Therefore, the military and police in the provincial capital have not yet imposed martial law for several days. The authorities had previously planned to abolish the Pacification Headquarters, but because pacification cannot be delayed during the winter defense period, they also ordered the border defense forces to quickly suppress local communists in the border areas. Recently, the First Independent Division on the Fujian border and the Third Independent Division on the Jiangxi border have been ordered to advance for suppression and have telegraphed successively to report on the situation of suppressing communists on the border. The original telegrams are as follows: (1) Telegram from the First Independent Division on the Fujian border: "Commander Yan's You (13th) electrical message states that the Fourth Regiment Luo Battalion was sent on Wen (12th) to suppress local communists in Guikeng. According to the battalion's report, they departed from Dongliu this morning (13th) and when they reached Guikeng, the local communists, numbering over a hundred, opened fire to resist. The team then bravely launched an attack, killing over ten on the spot. The bandits were then routed and fled to Luotang. In addition to burning a hundred sets of bandit uniforms and supplies, they also pursued them to Beizhai, but could not find any trace of the bandits. The team then returned to defense and reported on their mission." (2) Telegram from Qiu Guixin, Commander of the Third Regiment of the Third Independent Division on the Jiangxi border: "1. A team was sent to suppress local communists in Beijiang Xiapinglin and other places on Huiri, capturing red bandits Ye Fengchun, Huang Bai, Lai Gu, and others, totaling six, and seizing several guns. Furthermore, at Xinlongkou, local communists Ye Shuisheng and others, totaling three, were captured. Each was interrogated one by one, and they confessed to being bandit soldiers, investigation committee members, and finance committee members, and to coercing the people to create household registration and land registers. They have been executed by firing squad in Wujing. 2. According to a report this morning, over a hundred bandits gathered in Yaocun, Guangkou. The Third Battalion was ordered to send two companies to suppress them. When they reached Shangqucun, the bandits opened fire to resist. After a fierce attack for about an hour, the bandits were routed and fled to the high mountains behind the houses. In this battle, the bandit squad leader Peng Zhiwei and over ten other communist bandits were killed on the spot, and four Type 79 rifles and a red flag of the First Brigade were seized. Suppression is still underway. "</p>

<h3>Guangzhou National Products Exhibition Hall Opens</h3>
<p>National Products Parade Held on Double Ten Day</p>
<p>Second National Products Exhibition Opens on the Same Day</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province, due to the current national crisis, government officials and the people, both high and low, know that unless they revitalize national products and block loopholes, it will be insufficient to speak of storing up strength against foreign powers. Therefore, they spare no effort in advocating the use of national products. Fortunately, the National Products Exhibition Hall was completed and opened on Double Ten Day of this year. From now on, national products will have an exhibition agency, and those who purchase and use national products will have a national product standard, so as not to be confused by counterfeit national products. This is also a memorable event on the Double Ten National Day amidst the national crisis. It is understood that the Guangzhou National Products Exhibition Hall was planned and organized by the Municipal Government's Bureau of Social Affairs. The location is the old site of the City God Temple in the city, which is very convenient for transportation. The planning and organization have been ongoing for more than three years, starting with the former Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Wu Boliang, and continuing until now. The director has changed three times, but the construction of the exhibition hall has never stopped slightly. Finally, it was completed on Double Ten Day of this year. On that day, the exhibition hall opened, and the Second National Products Exhibition was held at the same time for the citizens to visit and arouse their enthusiasm for using national products. National product stores also sent goods for display in advance, with dazzling colors and beautiful arrangements. The hall was covered with warning slogans, including "After visiting the National Products Exhibition, you must immediately resolve to refuse to use foreign goods," "To love the country and save the nation, you must start by resolving to purchase and use national products," "Advocating national products can stimulate national spirit and preserve national virtues," "Entrepreneurs must work hard to increase production and improve manufacturing," and "Advocating national products is the duty of citizens." Various exhibits are categorized and arranged in an orderly manner. On that day, the number of people from all walks of life who visited the hall reached six or seven thousand, an endless stream. In the morning, due to layout arrangements, the opening ceremony was not held until about 2:00 PM. Those in attendance included the mayor, various bureau chiefs, representatives from the provincial and municipal party departments, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Women's Federation, and other representatives. The current Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs announced the history of the exhibition hall's preparation. The mayor gave an opening speech, elaborating on the advocacy of using national products. Then, representatives from the provincial and municipal party departments, the Women's Federation, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce gave speeches. Finally, a committee member from the National Products Association gave a reply speech. The meeting adjourned at about 4:00 PM. On that day, the Guangzhou Native Cloth Association took advantage of the grand opening of the National Products Exhibition Hall and launched a large-scale national product costume parade, initiated by all the native cloth merchants in the industry. All the native cloth produced in Guangdong Province was displayed and paraded on freight cars. Various styles were available. A total of twelve teams were divided, each with dozens of people. All were merchants and workers in the native cloth industry, uniformly dressed in native cloth, making a factual publicity campaign. Those in costume were dressed as blood souls, hoes, and good teams to punish unscrupulous merchants, describing the meaning of the purchase and transport of enemy goods being spurned by ten thousand people. There were also those dressed as unscrupulous merchants who smuggled enemy goods, no different from wielding a knife to commit suicide on their compatriots, arousing alarm and leaving a deep impression in the sea of consciousness.

<h3>Anhui Province Re-Orders Export Rice Donation</h3>
<p>Six Additional Branch Bureaus Established Besides the Head Office</p>
<p>Wheel-Transported Rice Donation Taxed at Four Corners Per Stone</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Anhui's collection of rice and grain export taxes was originally a fund to offset the Provincial Government's five million yuan road construction public bond. It had long been divided into wheel, sail, and cart transport, and rice and grain prohibition offices were established at Dashengguan and Bengbu in Wuhu to be responsible for the collection. This year, the province has a bumper harvest, and the export of rice and grain is enormous. In order to rectify this income, the provincial government has specially established a Grain Export Organization Committee to be in charge of it, and reorganized the prohibition offices in various places into Grain Export Management Bureaus, selecting members of the committee to serve concurrently as directors of the management bureaus. The committee has been established in the province, and in addition to the heads of the Finance and Construction Departments serving as ex officio members, Jiang Tonghou, Li Yunqi, Lu Zhongnong, Cheng Fuchu, Yu Youquan, He Duqing, and Xu Xuchu have been hired as members, and Li Yunqi has been designated as the chairman. In addition to the original three locations establishing head offices, directly under the Organization Committee, the Grain Export Management Bureau also established six branch bureaus in Dingbu, Chenjiaqian (belonging to Wuhu), Wuyi (belonging to Dashengguan), Gantai, Hao County, and Jieshou. Li Yunqi served concurrently as the director of the Wuhu Bureau, Lu Zhongnong served concurrently as the director of the Dashengguan Bureau, and Yu Youquan served concurrently as the director of the Bengbu Bureau. Because the Organization Committee decided to be located in Wuhu, Li Yunqi and all the committee members arrived in Wuhu at the same time yesterday. Today (18th) at 2:00 PM, a discussion meeting was held at the County Government, gathering representatives of wheel and sail rice merchants and members of the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce. Those who attended included Li Dachu, the representative of the wheel-transported Guangchao gang, Yuan Zhongyi, the representative of the sail-transported gang, and more than twenty other people. First, Chairman Li reported, generally saying that the provincial government had previously received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang to rush the construction of five major highways, which required a large amount of money at once and could not be raised, so it issued a road construction public bond of five million yuan and decided to levy export rice donations as the fund for the public bond, which had been approved by the Central Political Conference and established offices to collect the taxes. This time, in order to thoroughly rectify the situation, an Organization Committee was established in Wuhu, and rice merchant leaders were specially invited to discuss good methods together, etc. After discussion, it was decided that wheel-transported rice donations would be levied at four corners per stone, with five cents being returned to the Guangchao gang to repay the old debt of 360,000 yuan, and five cents being used to prosper the Wuhu market. Sail-transported rice donations would be levied at six corners per stone, and miscellaneous grains at three corners. Wheat would be exempt from donations due to the unified tax. Sail transport would have two representatives from the rice merchants participate in supervision to avoid difficulties during inspection. However, it is heard that the representatives of sail-transported rice merchants believe that the donation rate is too high and must wait for rice merchants from the entire province to come to Wuhu for consultation before they can agree.

<p>Request to Abolish Pig Boat Tax by Telegram. The Jiangyan Town Chamber of Commerce in this county received a letter from the Pig Industry Association of Taixing and Jingjiang, requesting the abolition of the business tax on pig boats passing through various ports along the river. It is reported that the Chamber of Commerce has forwarded the letter to the Joint Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to forward it to the Provincial Finance Department for a clear order of abolition to alleviate the difficulties of merchants.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Cloth Merchants Donate Funds to Support Volunteer Army. Bao Jiezhi, a cloth merchant from Jiaxing with vast wealth, has been quite stingy in the past. This time, due to competition in the cloth business, he became ill and bedridden for more than ten days, experiencing many feelings and realizing the error of his ways. He is willing to donate all of his assets to the Northeast Volunteer Army to purchase winter clothing. He will remit the funds directly to the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association in the coming days. Upon hearing this news, the Anti-Japanese Association of Hebei plans to build a memorial tower for him in Zhongshan Park to leave a permanent memory.</p>
<p>Pest Control Fund Changed to Education Funds. The Jiaxing County Pest Control Public Bond Fund has been collecting one jiao per dan under the subsidy item. Now that the collection period for this fund has expired, the County Education Bureau, with its extremely depleted education funds, intends to change the expired Pest Control Public Bond Fund to education funds. This has been approved by the Provincial Department, which has ordered the County Finance Bureau to continue collecting it. The County Government has issued a public notice after receiving the order.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Sixth Lottery Redemption of Construction Bonds. The Zhejiang Construction Bonds held their sixth lottery redemption yesterday (the 20th) at 2 p.m. at the Hangzhou City Chamber of Commerce. The amount of the bonds is quite large. The Ministry of Finance and the Auditing Department of the Central Government, as well as various institutions, banks, and money industries, sent representatives to supervise the event. Xu 𢡟, Secretary of the Finance Department, presided over the meeting and reported that the construction bonds amounted to ten million yuan, and that five lotteries had already been held, redeeming 2.5 million yuan. Today is the sixth lottery, and five groups should be drawn, one ticket per group, redeeming 500,000 yuan and paying 310,000 yuan in interest. After the report, attendees were invited to draw tickets in public. The winning numbers were 02, 31, 51, 71, and 97. All bondholders whose last two digits match the drawn numbers, regardless of whether they hold thousand-yuan, hundred-yuan, or ten-yuan bonds, have won. The redemption will begin on October 31 of this year, and interest will be paid at the same time. The Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Local Bank, and the Agricultural and Industrial Bank in this province, as well as the county governments and county treasuries, were designated as the institutions responsible for managing the redemption and interest payments.</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Organizes Association to Promote Domestic Goods. The Hangzhou City Chamber of Commerce believes that China is unfortunate to have suffered military aggression from Japanese bandits and continuous exploitation by foreign capital. Under this dual oppression, the nation is in danger. To avert the crisis, all merchants must consciously rise up and promote and protect inherent domestic products without fail. Therefore, following the example of the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce in organizing a committee to promote domestic goods, a resolution was passed at the first standing committee meeting on the 15th of this month to invite Shou Jingwei, Cheng Xinjin, Wang Wuquan, Shen Jiucheng, Jiang Senyu, Fang Guansan, Fang Jixiang, Wang Yongzhou, and Chen Hanchen to serve as nine preparatory committee members. The first preparatory meeting was held at the chamber at 2 p.m. on the 18th. Six people, including Jiang Senyu, attended. Zhu Huiqing, a representative of the executive committee of the City Chamber of Commerce, served as the temporary chairman and reported on the purpose and process of convening the meeting. Subsequently, three resolutions were passed: 1. Push Committees Shou Jingwei and Jiang Yusen to draft the association's regulations and submit them to the executive committee of the City Chamber of Commerce for approval and implementation. 2. Introduce Zhou Shilu, Chen Shufu, Zhang Xiongfei, Han Zhixue, Du Lubin, and Chen Rongru as members of the association and submit them to the executive committee of the City Chamber of Commerce for consideration and appointment. 3. Push Jiang Senyu to draft a work plan for the association. The meeting adjourned at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Special Document</p>
<h3>Zheng Luosheng et al.'s Letter to Hu Shi</h3>
<p>In Refutation of "Criticism of the Investigation Team's Report"</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Zhi, yesterday I read your work on the criticism of the investigation team's report, and I cannot help but express my opinions. I respectfully present a few points for your consideration: (1) "The issue of the disarmament of the Three Northeastern Provinces." Sir, you believe that the 200,000 troops in the Northeast cannot defend the territory, so you advocate disarmament. Such a fallacious view of "cutting off one's nose to spite one's face," generalizing from one person to the whole, and from one moment to tens of thousands of generations, should not have come from your mouth. Sir, you should know that the non-resistance of the Three Northeastern Provinces came from the orders of the so-called commanders-in-chief, and was by no means the consensus of all generals and soldiers. Consider Ma Zhanshan and others, who are fighting bloody battles today. Are they not the generals of the Three Northeastern Provinces of that day? Without this remaining armed force, there would be no such limited resistance. Would the Japanese warlords not be more eloquent in saying that the entire people of the Northeast unanimously support the puppet state? Even if we concede a hundred steps, assuming that armed forces are harmful and useless, we must disarm ourselves voluntarily and not be forced to withdraw by others. For example, if you resign from the principalship of Zhonggong School, it is because you did it voluntarily, and no one can criticize it. If you were forced by a foreign country, would you still be a free man? This is the first point to reflect on. (2) "The issue of establishing an autonomous government in the Three Northeastern Provinces." Sir, you expressed satisfaction with this proposal and even praised this autonomous government as superior to today's Guangdong and Sichuan. But sir, have you ever considered how this autonomous government was created? It was created by representatives from China and Japan and puppet representatives from the Three Northeastern Provinces under the control of the violent Japanese. Although our government can stipulate methods for the people's representatives in the Three Northeastern Provinces to elect them separately, in the dual oppression of the violent Japanese and the puppet state, who dares to represent the people's will? Only pro-Japanese traitors dare to be elected. With Japanese slaves participating in the meeting, on the surface, it seems that there are three voting rights, but in reality, Japan gets two and we get one. Before the meeting even starts, (the outcome is already determined). It is formed by a joint advisory conference. I ask you, was the Guangdong-Sichuan government ever formed by such a joint management conference? After it is formed, it must be confirmed by a declaration from the Chinese government. This declaration will be regarded as binding on the Chinese government by an international agreement. The Chinese government shall not conclude any agreements that violate the terms of the declaration. In return for an international agreement, I ask you, do Guangdong and Sichuan have this "forever forfeiting" constraint? Outside of the declaration, special police forces must be jointly trained by foreign training officers. The administrative head of the autonomous government may appoint a substantial number of foreign advisors, among whom the Japanese should occupy an important proportion. Two foreign nationals of different nationalities must also be appointed from the list nominated by the Council of the League of Nations to supervise the police and tax authorities and wield broad powers. A foreigner must also be appointed from the list submitted by the board of directors of the International Clearing Bank as the chief advisor to the Central Bank of the Three Northeastern Provinces. I ask you, do Guangdong and Sichuan have this strange phenomenon of selling out sovereignty? According to the proposal of the investigation team, although the central government has the power to manage customs, postal services, salt taxes, and to appoint the administrative head of the Three Northeastern Provinces for the first time, the allocation of these taxes and the future appointment of the administrative head must be decided by the advisory conference. The joint representatives of the Japanese and puppet representatives in the advisory conference will inevitably be detrimental to our side. The so-called management power is nominally illusory, and the so-called power of appointment is also a flash in the pan. I ask you, is the separation of Sichuan and Guangdong from the central government so severe? Sir, you avoid discussing these various harms, only lightly glossing over them with euphemisms. You greatly praise the autonomous government, which replaces the real with the fake, calling it a form of federation. I ask you, does the American-German federation have such a division and fragmentation, being both subordinate to the country and to a foreign country? This is the second point to reflect on. (3) "The issue of Sino-Japanese treaties for Japanese interests." The investigation team believes that the purpose of this treaty is that "Japan should freely participate in the economic development of the Northeast." The breadth of its rights is no different from being the master of the Northeast. Regarding "residence and land lease rights," there is a proposal that "Japanese people should be granted residence and consular jurisdiction in any part of the Three Northeastern Provinces and Rehe." This is ten times more severe than the residence and land lease rights requested in the Twenty-One Demands, which were limited to Southern Manchuria. Regarding "railway disputes," there is a proposal for "merger in name but actually a gift." The result of the merger of Japan and Korea is only Japan and no Korea. The result of the merger of Chinese and Japanese railways is only Japan and no us. Extending this to any form of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, Japan will inevitably be the master and we will be the slaves. All these kinds of disasters are obvious. Why don't you point them out? (4) "The issue of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Reconciliation, Arbitration, Non-Aggression, and Mutual Assistance." Regarding the content of this treaty, the investigation team advocates that "if one of the contracting parties or a third party commits any violation of the demilitarized zone, it shall constitute an act of aggression. The other party—or, in the event of an attack by a third party, both contracting parties—shall have the right to take any measures they deem appropriate to defend the demilitarized zone." According to this claim, the Three Northeastern Provinces will be transformed from "purely Chinese territory" into "joint management by China and Japan," which is greatly contrary to the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Why don't you correct it? (5) "The issue of Chinese commercial treaties." The investigation team does not know that "Japanese aggression is the cause of boycotting Japanese goods" and proposes that "the Chinese government undertakes to take all measures within its power to prohibit and suppress organized movements to boycott Japanese goods" without attaching the condition that "Japan shall not have any aggression or oppression against China." This is tantamount to advocating that Chinese people should recognize the thief as their father and welcome enemy goods, regardless of how oppressed they are by Japan. Disregarding justice and favoring power, why don't you refute it? This is the third point to reflect on. Furthermore, I have heard that you are close to Puyi, and when Puyi was arrested, you spoke out in his defense. This time, you are supporting the investigation team and praising their proposed methods such as "establishing an autonomous government in the Northeast." I suspect you have ulterior motives, so you are making these specious arguments. You even take the small to override the majority, saying, "We cannot but admire their fair judgment," and then saying, "Their seven months of hard work are worthy of our gratitude and respect." We cannot help but question the reason why you misused the word "we." (The rest omitted) Zheng Luosheng, Fang Zhizhen, Lin Youren respectfully submitted (Responsible communication address: No. 1, Sanyi Lane, Huaihai Road, Nanjing)</p>

<h3>Special Feature</h3>
<p>A Preliminary Discussion on Reforming Chinese School Education (11) Cheng · Tian · Fang</p>
<p>Previously, higher normal schools in China were independent, but in the past ten years, they have all been merged into universities and have become colleges of education. It is not necessarily impossible to establish colleges of education—or departments of education—within universities to study the theory of education. However, it is somewhat wrong to replace normal universities with colleges of education. Because colleges of education become a part of universities, their students have no way to receive special training. At the same time, the coursework of colleges of education often emphasizes teaching methods and neglects the substance of what is taught. Therefore, although students who graduate from colleges of education understand educational principles and teaching methods, they have no specialty when they actually go to teach in middle schools. They can teach Chinese, English, history, and mathematics. They can teach everything, but they cannot teach anything very well. This kind of middle school teacher is definitely not the kind of middle school teacher we hope for. Therefore, in the future, normal universities should be divided into departments of Chinese, foreign languages, history and geography, mathematics and physics, etc., just like the former higher normal schools. In addition to studying educational principles and other courses together, each department should have its own specialty. Those who study Chinese will teach Chinese in middle schools, and those who study history and geography will teach history and geography in middle schools. In this way, the studies of middle school students will surely receive a better influence.</p>
<p>Like normal schools, normal universities should be established by the state. The government should choose suitable locations across the country and establish two or three normal universities, which should be enough to meet current needs. Normal universities should enroll two types of students: one is graduates of normal schools whose service period has expired and who have not been found to be incompetent in the meantime, who can apply; the other is high school graduates who do not want to enter other universities but are willing to engage in education, who can also apply. Normal school graduates who re-enter normal universities after their service period has expired can graduate in four years because they have already received special training and have teaching experience. High school graduates must first study a two-year preparatory course, for a total of six years, because they have not received special training in the past. Normal university students do not pay tuition fees while they are in school, and the government provides food and clothing, but after graduation, the government assigns them to serve for four years. During the service period, the location cannot be chosen, and living expenses are also determined by the government according to the minimum cost of living in various places. Only after the service period expires can they freely apply for jobs. If there is any behavior that violates the rules or does not comply with the constraints while in school or after leaving school, the government should impose strict sanctions, on the one hand, recovering the expenses, and on the other hand, expelling them from school or canceling their qualifications as teachers. This method is exactly the same as the treatment of normal school students. Because they bear a special mission, they enjoy special rights. Since they enjoy special rights, they will naturally be subject to special sanctions. Why should a political university be established separately? Because China now needs political talents extremely urgently, and those who engage in politics, like those who engage in education, should receive special training. A country can maintain order and enable its people to live and develop upwards only by relying on two forces: the power of education and the power of politics. If a country loses these two forces, or uses them improperly, then this country will surely be chaotic, regress, and even perish. Now China is in extreme danger. We can only save this precarious country by relying on these two forces, education and politics. These two forces must be placed in the hands of people who have received special training and are capable of holding office before they can benefit society. Therefore, the state must establish normal universities to cultivate educational talents on the one hand, and establish political universities to cultivate political talents on the other hand.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Luo Jialun, President of National Central University, Gives a Speech on Forming an Organic National Culture (2)</h3>
<p>The first type was political reform. At that time, people like Stein and Hardenberg came out to improve German politics, establish civil servant judgments, and increase administrative efficiency, so that the various shortcomings of political division, fragmentation, disorganization, and incompetence in the past could be reformed. The second type was military reform. People like Scharnhorst and Gneisnau came out to reorganize German military affairs, especially to establish a conscription system, and to enrich various preparations in the military, which laid the foundation for later successful resistance against foreign aggression. The third type was the creation of a national culture. This force was the greatest, and its influence was the most universal and far-reaching. Its concrete manifestation relied on the founding of the University of Berlin by Wilhelm Von Humboldt and people like Fichte at the University of Berlin. Therefore, the famous modern American historian Gooch (G·P·Gooch) recognized that the work of founding the University of Berlin was not only an important event in German history but also an important event in European history. What is particularly admirable is the spirit of the University of Berlin at that time. Just when the French army was approaching and the internal situation was chaotic, German scholars were able to lecture in the besieged city, taking it upon themselves to create a German national culture. In his "Addresses to the German Nation" from 1807 to 1808, Fichte said, "Today, I speak to the entire German nation as a German. I will sweep away the myriad differences that have been caused by various unfortunate facts in this single nation for centuries. What I say to you who are sitting here is said for the entire German nation." We also need to do this now. We must also sweep away all the differences caused by various unfortunate facts in history at this critical moment of the nation's survival. From this point on, we will begin a new effort. The unification of the German nation was due to the fact that this entire national spirit first laid a foundation. In the end, Bismarck was merely harvesting the success of his time. The University of Berlin represented the soul of the German nation at that time, allowing the entire German nation to be subtly transformed under the national culture created by the University of Berlin, forming this organic whole organization. A nation cannot establish a center and unite if it does not have an organic national culture. Therefore, I especially propose the creation of an organic national culture as the mission of this university, and I earnestly hope that everyone will work hard for the survival and future of the nation.</p>

<h3>Baoshan Elementary School Teachers Jointly Demand Back Pay</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of last semester, the Baoshan County Education Bureau has repeatedly been in arrears with the funding for the schools for the months of February, March, April, May, June, July, August, and September, as well as reorganization fees and promotion fees. All the elementary school teachers in the county felt that their own lives were not guaranteed at all and that the schools were in dire straits, which was unbearable. Therefore, at 10 a.m. on the 19th, more than 50 teachers from various district vocational schools jointly gathered at Songyang Elementary School in the city and went to the Education Bureau to demand payment. Beforehand, they organized a propaganda team, posted slogans, and distributed declarations and slogans. They also appointed Qian Housan and others as spokespersons to demand six items from Bureau Chief Feng Guohua: (1) Clear payment of funding for the months of February, March, April, May, June, July, August, and September; (2) Clear payment of reorganization fees; (3) Clear payment of promotion fees; (4) Oppose the salary deduction method; (5) Oppose the misappropriation of education funds; (6) Pay education fees on a monthly basis. After Director Feng answered them one by one, the teachers all felt dissatisfied. The two sides debated for a long time, and the atmosphere was very tense. It was not until about 8 p.m. that Director Feng gave a written reply to the teachers' requests as follows: (1) The unpaid fees for February, March, April, May, June, July, August, and September will be jointly answered by the Director of the Pujiang Bureau; the unpaid fees for July, August, and September will be paid in full during this semester; (2) The unpaid reorganization fees will be submitted to the province for allocation; (3) The unpaid promotion fees will be jointly answered by the Director of the Pujiang Bureau; (4) Regarding the salary deduction method, please submit it to the bureau from each school for forwarding to the province; (5 and 6) Items 2 will be implemented. The teachers felt that they were still satisfied, and then they returned to their respective schools.</p>

<p>An American Californian newspaper sports reporter has recently drawn up a list of the world's top ten tennis players for this year, with Vines ranked first and Cochet second. However, compiling this list of ten players was extremely difficult, as most players in the world are currently at a similar level, making it hard to distinguish between them. Even beyond the top ten, many other players possess skills that are no less impressive than those who made the list. The following ten players were selected based on this year's various competitions and the players' actual abilities. As for the women's rankings, Mrs. Moody remains the undisputed champion.</p>

<h3>Davidson on the Responsibilities and Powers of a Soccer Referee, Part 1: The Responsibilities and Powers of a Soccer Referee (Part 2)</h3>
<p>I will now discuss the responsibilities and powers of a referee as stated in the referee regulations.</p>
<p>(1) Field and Ball: The referee's responsibility is to first observe whether the field is accurately marked and whether the goal net is securely attached to the posts. Then, they must check whether the ball's dimensions comply with Rule 1 of the Laws of the Game. As for the weight of the ball in a football association, please ask Kefer. I do not know, and in fact, no one knows, because the Laws of the Game do not specify the weight of the ball. If asked about the weight of an international football, I can say that it is 13 to 15 ounces. A football club can notify a team to prepare a ball of this weight, or they can notify the team to prepare a scale if the referee needs to measure the weight of the ball.</p>
<p>(2) Timekeeping: Rule 3 of the Laws of the Game stipulates that the referee must be the timekeeper and must deduct any pauses or wasted time during the match. Rule 2 stipulates that a match lasts for 90 minutes.</p>
<p>(3) Kick-off: At the kick-off, the referee must ensure that the opposing players are outside the ten-yard radius of the center circle. They must also remember that the sound of the whistle does not start the match; the match only begins after the ball is kicked from the center of the field.</p>
<p>(4) Half-time: Rule 3 states that the referee must limit the half-time break to five minutes.</p>
<p>(5) Goal: If a shot knocks the goalpost down, it is the referee's right to count it as a goal. It must be understood that, except in the circumstances stipulated in Rule 4, no one on the team has the right to claim a goal.</p>
<p>(6) Corner Flags: Rules 1 and 17 relate to the corner flags. The referee must ensure that the flagpoles are five feet from the ground to the top and that the flags do not move when a corner kick is taken.</p>
<p>(7) Goalkeeping: Rule 8 is known as the "goalkeeper protection rule," but the referee does not need to treat the goalkeeper as weak and protect them with cotton or wool. If the goalkeeper has the ball in their hands, attacking, charging, or extending a foot in front of the goalkeeper is not a foul and should not be penalized.</p>
<p>(8) Rough Play: Rule 9 authorizes the referee to stop rough play during the match. This depends entirely on how the referee applies the Laws of the Game. Whether the match being officiated is easy or difficult, pushing or striking with the arm is absolutely forbidden. Stop it at the start of the match, even if it requires penalizing 99 free kicks.</p>
<p>(9) Charging: It must be remembered that charging that is not forceful and dangerous is permitted and constitutes a legal charge that should not be penalized. Penalizing it would violate the Laws of the Game, but in practical terms, the referee is the sole judge.</p>
<p>(10) Boots: Rule 13 concerns the players' boots. It is the referee's responsibility to inspect the players' boots at the start of the match or during half-time. In the Scottish League, the referee does not need to be asked but can inspect the boots of both teams.</p>
<p>(11) Rule 13 of the Laws of the Game: Rule 13 states that the referee's responsibilities and powers are as follows: (1) The referee must enforce the Laws of the Game and ensure they are effective. (2) They must resolve points of contention. (3) They must not argue with players, officials, or spectators. (4) They must record the result and time of the match.</p>
<p>(12) Foul Language: The referee must stop unsporting behavior and foul language, first with a warning, and if repeated, by ordering the player off the field. If foul language is directed at the referee, an immediate order to leave the field is permissible without a warning.</p>
<p>(13) Suspension of Play: In cases of rough play, the referee can order the offending player off the field. Rough play includes unsporting language. The referee must report the name of the cautioned player to the club. Any time lost due to the suspension of play must be deducted. In necessary situations, the referee can stop or declare the match finished. Rough play that occurs after play has stopped or when the ball is not in play must also be dealt with.</p>
<p>(14) Linesmen: The referee can report or directly replace the linesmen if they obstruct the referee's actions or engage in improper conduct. Linesmen may not shout or instruct players.</p>
<p>(15) Free Kicks: Rule 17 authorizes the referee to award free kicks, as do two other rules in the Laws of the Game.</p>
<p>(16) Penalty Kicks: Rule 10 also authorizes the referee to award penalty kicks. If a defender commits a foul within the penalty area that violates Rule 9, it must be known that regardless of the ball's location on the field, if the referee observes a violation of Rule 9, they can award a penalty kick.</p>

<h3>Donghua Football Team Defeats Jiaotong University</h3>

Early in the match, Donghua's Li Yichen scored two goals in quick succession, followed by a goal from Chen Hongguang, making the score 3-0 at halftime.

<h3>Registration Status for Public Amateur Sports</h3>
<p>The fourth Public Amateur Sports Meet, organized by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, has seen enthusiastic participation from citizens who have been going to the Municipal First Public Sports Ground to register since the 15th of this month. It is predicted that by the registration deadline on the 23rd, the number of registrants will reach 300. It is understood that the purpose of the meet is to promote mass sports and encourage widespread interest, which differs from the citywide sports meet held last year. Therefore, Chinese athletes who participated in this year's International Sports Meet and the top ten athletes who participated in the International Walking Race will not be invited to participate in order to avoid a situation where a small number of people win medals while the majority are left disappointed. It is believed that all sports leaders, embracing the enthusiasm for promoting sports, will agree with this decision.</p>
<h3>New Basketball Techniques (15) (Not to be Reproduced) Original Author: Clauro Burcky. Joint Translation by Zhang Guoxun and Qian Yiqin</h3>
<p>Although the University of Pennsylvania basketball team in the United States is not as invincible as in the past, the formations taught by the team's coach, Mr. Lon Jourdet, such as the one shown here, if properly applied, will make it extremely difficult for defenders to block.</p>
<p>Number 3 feigns an intention to pass the ball to Number 2 but instead passes it slightly off-center to Number 4, who is moving into the free-throw area. Number 1 runs down the sideline, and Number 5 turns back. After passing the ball, Number 3 also runs towards the basket along the arc of the free-throw line. Their (Number 3's) defender will inevitably follow them, effectively obstructing Number 5's defender. Number 5 can then receive the pass from Number 4 without obstruction and shoot for the basket. Alternatively, Number 4 can also turn away from the defender and pass to Number 1, who is running straight down the sideline, allowing them to dribble forward and shoot.</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei to Leave for Germany Tomorrow for Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen and Others Came to Shanghai Yesterday to Meet with Him</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Held Farewell Gathering Last Night</p>
<p>And Discussed Opinions on the Report</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, is scheduled to depart for Germany tomorrow aboard the French mail steamer "André Lebon" for medical treatment. Song Ziwen, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan, and other ministers arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Nanjing to meet with Mr. Wang. The remaining ministers of the Executive Yuan will also come to Shanghai this morning to see him off. Mr. Wang issued a farewell address yesterday, outlining his personal views on the Lytton Report. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Ministers Arrive in Shanghai: In addition to Railway Minister Gu Mengyu and Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan, who had already arrived in Shanghai, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, Industry Minister Chen Gongbo, Education Minister Zhu Jiahua, Minister of the Civil Service Niu Yongjian, and Chu Minyi all arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:00 AM on the overnight train from Nanjing. Except for Song, who disembarked at the Zhenru Railway Station, the others disembarked at the North Station. Foreign Minister Luo Wengan and others are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<p>Meeting Between Wang and Song: Mr. Wang left the Noel Hospital at 9:30 AM yesterday morning and went directly to Chu Minyi's residence on Avenue Albert. At 10:30 AM, Song Ziwen arrived at Chu's residence to meet with Mr. Wang, and they talked until 11:40 AM, when Song left in a hurry. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, Railway Minister Gu Mengyu and others went to pay their respects again. Mr. Wang returned to the Noel Hospital to rest at 8:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<p>Song Ziwen's Remarks: After meeting with Mr. Wang, Mr. Song Ziwen told reporters that he had met with Mr. Wang today (i.e., yesterday) because Mr. Wang was about to leave the country. As the Acting President of the Executive Yuan, he sought Mr. Wang's instructions on all policy directions. Mr. Wang is scheduled to set sail for Germany on the 22nd to receive treatment at the Hamburg Institute of Tropical Diseases. Mrs. Wang and secretaries will accompany him. Railway Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming has decided not to go due to departmental affairs. The Central Committee has accepted the proposal for Chiang and Wang to convene the Third Plenary Session in early December. The proposal was submitted to the Central Standing Committee this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) to discuss detailed measures and dates. The issue of the President of the Executive Yuan will be resolved at the Third Plenary Session. Before the Third Plenary Session is convened, he will continue to act as the responsible agent, and there will be no changes to the ministers. In addition to those who have already arrived in Shanghai to meet with Mr. Wang, the remaining ministers will come to Shanghai tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning) to visit Mr. Wang for a further discussion.</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo's Statement: Industry Minister Chen Gongbo told reporters yesterday that Mr. Wang would return to China during his three-month leave. The position of President of the Executive Yuan will definitely not change before the Third Plenary Session. He has not yet heard whether Mr. Sun Zan-sheng is the successor. The Central Committee has largely decided on its views on the report but cannot yet announce them. There are indeed measures to recover lost territory. Although no measures have been seen recently, this does not mean that the claim to recover lost territory has been abandoned.</p>
<p>Wang Issues Farewell Address: Mr. Wang issued a farewell address last night, outlining his personal views on the League of Nations Investigative Committee report and hoping that the Chinese people would unite to save the nation from peril. The full text is recorded below: In early September, Zhao-ming's illness worsened, and he requested leave for treatment, thinking that a few days of rest would be enough to recover fully. However, after the publication of the diagnosis report by four doctors in early October, he realized that his illness was serious and that it was necessary to seek medical treatment abroad. The Central Government therefore granted him leave so that he could seek medical treatment. At a time when national affairs are critical, to leave so readily goes against my wishes. However, rather than being confined to bed, lingering without help, it is better to follow the doctors' advice and temporarily go abroad to seek specialized treatment, in the hope of recovering and continuing to work for the country. Since falling ill, I have received condolences from my comrades, and I have long delayed in responding. As I am about to leave temporarily, I would like to share a few of my humble opinions as if we were talking face to face. Zhao-ming has not changed his mind about sharing the national crisis since he arrived in Shanghai from Guangzhou last October and entered Nanjing in January of this year. However, out of ten political measures, only one has been achieved, and I feel ashamed before the gods, beyond words to describe. If politics is not refined, then even if one wants to share the national crisis, there is no way to do so. However, regarding the pace of political measures, comrades may have different views, so it is necessary to unite under the banner of shared national crisis. These two things seem contradictory but are actually complementary. I hope that all comrades will remain sincere and work cautiously. The Standing Committee of the Central Political Conference was originally composed of Chiang, Hu, and Zhao-ming. Comrade Hu has not been to Nanjing for a long time, and Zhao-ming is now absent due to illness, leaving Comrade Chiang to shoulder the burden alone. It makes me feel uneasy. Since Zhao-ming has been ill, the duties of the President of the Executive Yuan have been bravely undertaken by Vice President Song, allowing me to rest and recuperate, for which I am extremely grateful.</p>
<p>Thoughts on the Report: Mr. Wang then continued to express his thoughts on the League of Nations Investigative Committee report, saying: "I have read the League of Nations Investigative Committee report during my illness, and I would like to share my thoughts as follows: First, the Chinese government's submission of the case against Japan to the League of Nations was the most reasonable and legal position and method. The League of Nations Covenant is the only law that member states and those who agree with the League of Nations Covenant should jointly abide by. Only when all countries in the world abide by this covenant can world peace be maintained. The Chinese government has never forgotten to maintain peace, so it submitted the case to the League of Nations, which is responsible for ensuring peace. Second, implementing the League of Nations Covenant is the responsibility of the League of Nations. Since the Chinese government submitted this case, the League of Nations has made resolutions based on the principle that the League of Nations must implement the covenant. The purpose of sending this investigative committee was to investigate the truth of the facts and determine who was responsible. Third, the Investigative Committee's report is clear and fair in its account of the facts and its observation of the causes and effects of the Northeast Incident. It clearly recognizes that Japan deliberately undermined China's territorial integrity in order to pursue its policy of aggression, which was the country's pre-determined plan. We should praise the Investigative Committee's efforts and fair judgment. However, I cannot help but feel regret that the solutions proposed by the Investigative Committee after recounting the facts do not seem to be consistent with the facts it describes itself. Fourth, judging from the intent of the report, the Investigative Committee seems to place full legal, political, and moral responsibility on Japan. The Investigative Committee knows that Japan's past actions and plans in the three eastern provinces are the source of all disasters in the Far East, and it clearly recognizes that the so-called Manchurian state is only a puppet organization nurtured by Japanese force. However, the Investigative Committee does not dare to hold Japan fully responsible for this incident, but instead resorts to twists and turns to propose so-called peaceful reconciliation measures. If this proposal by the Investigative Committee is fully accepted by the League of Nations, it will only show that the League of Nations has fair observations and sympathy for justice, but its power of sanctions is not sufficient to support it. Not only will world peace lose all guarantees, but also the League of Nations' commitment to eliminating international disputes will not be fulfilled. For the sake of the future of peace, China must call on the world to pay close attention to this point. Fifth, what our country should seriously consider now is how to deal with the current problem: war or peace? If we choose the former, then everything that Japan has seized by force in the past will be recovered by force. This is seeking justice by force. If we choose the latter, then we will seek justice peacefully. The most important method is to accept the League of Nations' sympathy for us and to seek to correct and increase its weakness in sanctions in order to achieve final victory. However, in any case, the government and the people must unite. Otherwise, if we talk about peace, we will only be singing high-sounding words that are of no practical benefit. If we talk about war, we will not be able to organize our own unified front, which will only hasten our country's demise. The past failures were caused by this. If we can avoid repeating this mistake in the future, we will gain a lot. Sixth, unity is strength. The way to save the country today is unity. Comrades, the government and the people, the central government and the local governments, should all regard this as a matter of course and work together. As for the local governments, internal wars caused by territorial conflicts are intolerable in China. Those who dare to defy public opinion and become warlords will only destroy themselves. I have outlined my humble opinions as far as they go, and I hope you will consider them carefully." Twentieth of October, Twenty-first year, Wang Zhao-ming</p>
<h3>General Li Du Sends a Clever Telegram</h3>
<p>Twelve Counties in Jilin Have Not Been Lost</p>
<p>My Personal Existence Will Be Shared with This Corner</p>
<p>General Li Du is currently stationed with General Ding Chao in Muling. Of the twelve counties defended by Li, the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun is still flying in those counties. Recently, postal service has returned to normal. Yesterday, he sent a telegram to his friend Wang Bokang, former Director of Education of Jilin, in extremely somber terms. The original telegram is recorded below: "Brother Bokang, I have received your telegram. I deeply appreciate your long-standing concern for the country, which has led to your serious illness. Fortunately, Heaven has blessed the righteous, and you have recovered without medicine. I am comforted from afar. The Three Northeastern Provinces Incident is a painful example of miscalculations due to non-resistance. Friendly forces have united to rise up in self-defense, at a time when the Japanese army is seizing our political power and the people are losing protection. I originally hoped that the Central Plains would send troops as soon as possible to recover the lost territory and avenge our shame. However, the people have been trapped in deep fire and water for more than a year. Our army is isolated in a corner and has fought in over a hundred battles, long exhausted. The Central Government still has no thorough solution, and the situation is becoming increasingly depressing. It is truly heartbreaking to speak of this. However, from the beginning of the uprising, we have resolved to sacrifice ourselves. Now, we are maintaining a corner of the Northeast, with twelve counties that have not been lost. In the future, my personal existence will be shared with this corner. Fortunately, the morale of our soldiers is extremely high, and in every battle, they often fight with bare chests. The Japanese invaders have long been running for their lives. If the hearts of the people in the Three Northeastern Provinces are not dead and world justice is not extinguished, we can still achieve final victory. Looking afar at the clouds and mountains, I cannot help but feel my spirit soaring. Your brother, Li Du, sealed with his chop."</p>
<h3>Luo Wengan and Others Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, Military Affairs Minister He Yingqin, Chief of the General Staff Zhu Peide, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Shi Qingyang, Railway Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming, Central Committee Member Ye Chucang, Vice President of the Academia Sinica Yang Xingfo, Central Committee Member Bai Yunti, Liu Ruiheng and others, all left Nanjing by overnight train last night and are expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Liu Cunhou Telegrams Regarding Dispatch of Troops</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang's representative stationed in Shanghai received a telegram from Liu Xiang, saying, "Fan Chongshi, confidential: I recently received a telegram from Zi Hui (Yang Sen) forwarded from Governor Liu (Liu Cunhou), which stated, 'Tang Shizun and others have telegraphed the Tongdian [circular telegram], proposing that generals lead troops to Sui (Suining) to stop the Sichuan conflict. We also strongly agree with this proposal. We have dispatched Zhaoqian (Liu Cunhou's younger brother) to lead over 10,000 troops, one route via Zi Yu, Changjia, Fuyi, and Huangdu River, and the other via Sanhui, Jingbian Temple, to camp at Yingshan and Pengxi for centralized command and await your (Liu Xiang's) orders.' This information is specially conveyed, Liu Xiang."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance to Impose Import Tax on Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Tax Rate Currently Under Consideration</p>
<p>According to banking sources, in order to restrict the sale of foreign rice in China, the Ministry of Finance, based on the principles of the National Food Conference, has decided to impose an import tax on foreign rice. It is reported that the tax rate and measures are still under consideration. Historically, China has not taxed food imports. This move by the Ministry of Finance is intended to help the domestic agricultural sector.</p>
<h3>County Food Administration Association Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>First Committee Meeting to be Held Next Wednesday</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received a provincial order to organize a County Food Administration Committee, which was to be established by the 20th of this month. After receiving the order, the County Government actively prepared and appointed local fair-minded individuals as committee members in accordance with regulations. In addition to the County Magistrate, who is an ex-officio member and serves as Chairman, and the Director of the Finance Bureau, Wang Huazhao, who is a designated member, seven individuals were selected, including Jiang Shijie (current Director of the Land and Property Management Office) from the first district, Kang Yongnian (Deputy Director of the Land and Property Management Office) from the second district, Zhang Yi (Director of the Farmers' Education Center) from the third district, Tang Fuqian from the fourth district, Qin Xitian (former Director of the Land and Property Management Office) from the fifth district, Zhang Jingye (Standing Committee Member of the County Party Headquarters) from the sixth district, and Shen Tong. The County Government sent notices to all committee members for their information. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a meeting was held at the County Government to announce the establishment of the committee. However, as all committee members were not present, it was decided to hold the first committee meeting on the 26th of this month (next Wednesday). It is reported that the County Government has instructed the district heads to organize and establish district food administration associations within a specified period.</p>
<h3>Standing Committee Meeting of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce</h3>
<p>Case of Assisting the Guangzhou Water and Electricity Company</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce held a standing committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock. Wen Lanting, Chen Riping, and Chairman Lin Kanghou were present. They discussed three proposals from the Beiping Chamber of Commerce: (A) Relief for the rural economy and prohibition of imported foreign rice. The resolution was to forward the proposal. (B) Shops must join trade associations, and trade associations must join the Chamber of Commerce. The resolution was to forward the proposal. (C) Prohibition of selling enemy goods. The resolution was to file it. (D) Regarding the Guangzhou Chinese Merchants Water and Electricity Company's letter requesting assistance, as the Guangzhou Municipal Government was unreasonably trying to run the company as a municipal enterprise, the chairman reported on the case's progress. After discussion, it was generally agreed that the Guangzhou Municipal Government did not provide assistance when the former Huatong Water and Electricity Company was in difficulty. Now that the company is showing signs of recovery, the government is trying to take it over, which seems inconsiderate of the difficulties faced by businesses. The resolution was to send a telegram to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee to find ways to prevent this and keep it as a commercial enterprise. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Governments to Issue Silk Industry Treasury Bonds</h3>
<p>Enthusiastic Registration of Stored Silk and Cocoons</p>
<p>Disputes over Bond Funds Have Been Resolved</p>
<p>Silk factories register stored silk and cocoons for export. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments issue treasury bonds and allocate subsidies for relief. The issuance is imminent. The silk market still has not improved compared to before. The labor unrest in silk factories in this city has completely subsided. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Treasury Bonds: The Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments, to fundamentally rescue the silk industry, are issuing Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Treasury Bonds, with a total amount of four million yuan. It has been decided to first issue two million two hundred thousand yuan. For all stored factory silk that has been registered and approved by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Committee for Consolidating Stored Silk and Cocoons, a subsidy of one hundred taels of silver will be allocated for each dan (unit of weight) exported. The treasury bond fund management committee has now been established, and all procedures are fully in place. The issuance is imminent. However, before the issuance, the procedures for exporting stored factory silk are as follows: All stored silk that has been registered and approved will be assigned a number by the consolidation committee and stored in warehouses. After it is sold, the committee will be notified for verification, and an export permit will be issued. After inspection by the Commodity Inspection Bureau and issuance of a public measurement certificate, it will be reported to the Jianghai Customs for export. The Jianghai Customs will stamp the export declaration as proof and return it to the silk merchant for safekeeping. After the treasury bonds are issued, the receipt will be exchanged with the consolidation committee, and the treasury bonds will be collected from the fund management committee.</p>
<p>Consolidating Stored Silk and Cocoons: A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency specifically interviewed Shen Huachen, a member of the Committee for Consolidating Stored Silk and Cocoons of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, yesterday to inquire about the status of the consolidation of stored silk and cocoons. According to him, since the committee was established, it has been handling the registration of stored silk and cocoons. As of yesterday, a total of 7,930 bales of stored silk that had been registered and approved and exported, or silk reeled from stored cocoons, had been registered. As for the report that exports of stored factory silk would be exempt from taxes and given subsidies only until the end of this year, the committee has not received an order from the Ministry of Industry to date. Moreover, the number of stored factory silk that has been exported is very small, and the silk industry treasury bonds have not yet been issued. Therefore, the case ending at the end of this year may not be a fact. Recently, the sales of Chinese silk in the European and American markets have been normal, but there has been no improvement compared to before.</p>
<p>Labor Unrest Completely Subsided: The labor dispute in silk factories in this city, caused by workers demanding the restoration of wages, holiday pay, and overtime pay, has completely subsided after the party and government organs vigorously mediated and persuaded them. The workers reluctantly returned to work due to contract restrictions. The method of the labor-capital contract of July 8 is maintained. The original text of the contract is as follows: (1) Due to the decline of the silk industry, the capital side has suffered a great blow. For the sake of labor-capital mutual assistance, the wages of female workers of the first class will be temporarily reduced to 45 cents of foreign currency per person per day. The wages of other workers will be determined in proportion to this. (2) Female workers' overtime pay and holiday pay will be temporarily suspended. (3) Working hours will remain the same at eleven hours and will not be extended. (4) Employees' salaries will be calculated and paid monthly according to the original treatment conditions. (5) Employees' silkworm moth subsidies and overtime work will temporarily maintain the status quo. (6) This condition will be valid from the date of signing until December of this year.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Industry Telegraphed Zhejiang Provincial Government Requesting Reduction of Business Tax for Wholesale Merchants</h3>
<p>The Silk and Satin Industry Association of this city sent telegrams to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Department of Finance yesterday, saying: "We believe that Zhejiang Province is the richest area for silk production, and Shanghai is the main distribution center for more than 90% of silk sales. Therefore, the price of silk in Shanghai depends entirely on the size of production costs in the producing areas. This is an unchangeable principle. Recently, we heard that your province is collecting business tax on silk fabrics, regardless of whether they are sold retail or wholesale, and charging the same tax rate. We fear that wholesale merchants will not be able to afford it, affecting the production of the entire silk industry. The impact is significant, and we cannot help but speak out. Our association is the citywide silk and satin industry organization in the sales area and has a related relationship. Seeing the daily decline of domestic silk and satin in recent years, we fear the industry will perish if no relief is sought. Therefore, we dare not hesitate to express our views and respectfully present the principles that should be used to distinguish between retail and wholesale taxation to your esteemed leaders. Those who do not understand the true essence of business may view retail and wholesale as the same thing, with no distinction. However, they do not know that retail merchants sell directly to consumers, and once sold, there is no further obligation to pay taxes. Wholesale merchants are different. Often, A sells to B, and B sells internally. They are mutually wholesaled and sold through various wholesale merchants before reaching the hands of retail merchants, which is difficult to predict. Each sale must pay a business tax. The total amount of taxes paid may exceed several times the business tax paid by retailers. If no distinction is made, it is tantamount to driving small wholesale merchants who only receive commission into the realm of extinction. The production of the entire silk industry will also be fundamentally shaken. Wholesale businesses account for 80% of our association's members. We sincerely believe that this is unacceptable. We have found in item 4 of the Interim Measures for Business Tax in your province that 'wholesale merchants in the special product sales industry shall be charged half of the business tax rate for retail businesses.' The interim measures are about to be implemented. We have heard that various industries are distinguishing between retail and wholesale, but the silk and satin industry is not distinguishing between retail and wholesale and is taxed at the same rate. The Hangzhou Silk and Satin Industry Association has repeatedly appealed for a reduction, but it has not been approved. Is it possible that the silk and satin industry, on the verge of death, still has the remaining strength to bear exceptional taxation compared to other industries? We also read the Jiang-Zhe Silk Industry Relief Case passed by the Central Political Conference on March 11, 1931, and stipulated the principles: (A) Taxation should not be listed as luxury goods but as daily necessities; (B) Taxation should be uniform everywhere. Based on this, we know that the tax rate for the silk and satin industry must be uniformly levied in any region of the country. The highest meeting has already passed a resolution and ordered it to be implemented. However, now, Hangzhou City is not only unable to share the government's relief but also unable to enjoy the same treatment as other industries in the same province. How can it be possible to move a mountain with the strength of a mosquito? Therefore, we dare not presume to present the reasons why the tax rate for the silk and satin industry should be distinguished between retail and wholesale to your esteemed leaders. We respectfully request your review and understanding of the pain of silk merchants losing their businesses. Allow wholesale businesses to be taxed at half of the 2/1000 rate for retail businesses to avoid shaking the entire silk industry and maintain the livelihoods of all Zhejiang silk merchants. We are anxiously awaiting your orders. Sincerely, Lu Bing, Chairman of the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association, seal.</p>
<h3>Measures for Taxing Goods Transported by Civilian Ships After the Northeast Customs Blockade</h3>
<p>Civilian ships transporting goods to and from various ports were previously exempt from taxes after reporting to the regular customs. Since the Northeast Customs implemented a blockade, how should civilian ships transporting goods to and from ports such as Niuzhuang, Andong, and Dalian, which were previously exempt from taxes, be handled? This matter is of great concern to commerce. According to the Xin Sheng News Agency's inquiry to the Jianghai Customs Tax Department, the customs previously received a clear order from the government that native goods transported to Andong and Niuzhuang, which were previously tax-exempt, should still be handled as before. However, if the same goods are transported to Dalian by civilian ships, export tax will be levied. All goods transported from Dalian will be subject to import tax. As for imported foreign goods transported by civilian ships from the ports of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, import tax will also be levied. All of these measures have been announced to all merchants by the Nanshi office of the customs for compliance.</p>
<h3>Numerous Requests to Abolish the Pig Tax in Jiangbei</h3>
<p>United Pig Industry Association: The United Association of Fresh Pig Traders of various counties in Jiangsu Province submitted another petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, stating: "We are petitioning regarding the illegal interception and collection of pig taxes on passing pigs by the business tax bureaus of Jing, Ru, and Tai counties in Jiangbei, which is destroying farmers' sideline businesses, oppressing merchants and travelers, and is unbearable. We respectfully request your review and swift order to strictly prohibit this matter. We, the representatives, believe that the collection of business tax has clear provisions in the law and should be the same everywhere. Illegal interception and collection is not allowed. It violates the national authority to reduce the levy and remove the threat, disturbs farmers' sideline businesses, and endangers the safety of merchants and travelers. However, after collecting business tax, the business tax bureaus of Jing, Ru, and Tai counties suddenly established arbitrary checkpoints at the ports of each county from September 21st of this year, calling them sub-offices and illegally intercepting and collecting pig taxes on passing pigs. They charge two jiao of foreign currency per head, calling it business tax. Regardless of the size of the pig, they estimate the price at 20 yuan per head and forcibly extract 10/1000, completely disregarding the provisions of Articles 3 and 7 of the Business Law and the interpretation of the Ministry of Finance on May 2nd of the 20th year of the Republic (1931). Under the National Government's glorious order to reduce levies, they attempt to revive the likin tax. Is this not illegal and dereliction of duty? Moreover, Jiangbei is a barren and impoverished land, and its agricultural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. The only thing that can support their livelihoods is the sideline business of pig raising. Now, they disregard everything and arbitrarily collect taxes, increasing the burden on farmers. Is this not destroying farmers' sideline businesses? Our country is founded on agriculture, and liberating farmers is a principle clearly stated in our party's platform. One or two lower-level officials are courting favor and undermining national discipline. Is it not necessary to build the administrative foundation of the country on the people? And can the people be fooled by one or two lower-level officials? A single spark can start a prairie fire. This is evident from past history. Guanzi said, 'When clothing and food are sufficient, people will know honor and disgrace.' The people are poor, and their wealth is exhausted, which is rampant today. If they are allowed to continue to be squeezed, the farmers of Jiangbei, after the disaster, will never have a chance to catch their breath. The weak will have no means of survival, and the strong will take risks, which is to be expected. This is not a false alarm from the representatives but because the tax bureaus disregard the law, disregard the people's livelihood, are accustomed to deceiving superiors and suppressing inferiors, and public opinion is in an uproar. We have no choice but to report to seek redress. Therefore, we jointly submit this petition and respectfully request your review and swift order to strictly prohibit this matter in order to maintain the rule of law and relieve the people of Jiangsu. This is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce: The City Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, stating: "To the Nanjing Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Zhenjiang Provincial Government: We have notified that the business tax bureaus of Jingtai and four counties have set up checkpoints along the ports and are intercepting and collecting pig taxes. The method is completely a disguised likin tax. We telegraphed your Yuan and Ministry on the 5th of this month, requesting the abolition of the tax in accordance with the law. It has been almost half a month, and we recently received a reply from the Ministry, which is being forwarded to the county for investigation. According to a report from the Fresh Pig Traders Association, the bureaus have recently intensified their efforts. Initially, they only sent police to extort money. Now, they are detaining ships. Fresh pigs need to be fed, and once detained, they are in danger of starving to death. The bureaus are violating law and order and may cause incidents. We request your Yuan and Ministry to swiftly forward a telegram to abolish the checkpoints and stop collecting the tax and to punish the members of the bureau for illegally and arbitrarily collecting taxes in order to maintain the tax law. Sincerely, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, Hao.</p>
<h3>Population Statistics of the French Concession</h3>
<p>Translated by the Foreign Affairs Society from the "Zi Lin West News" on the 20th, "The population statistics of the residents of the French Concession as of September 20th total 478,552 people. Last year, it was 456,012 people. The rapid increase in population can be further proven by its figures. For example, in 1925, it was 297,072 people, and in 1920, it was only 170,229 people. At the beginning of this century (i.e., 30 years ago), the total number of residents was 92,268 people, of which only 622 were foreigners. The most recent figures consist of 462,342 Chinese and 16,210 foreigners. The total number of Chinese also includes 24,178 transients and 20,325 people living on boats on the river. Among the foreigners, 748 are transients.

<h3>Villagers in Jiangwan Urgently Request Relief</h3>
<p>The Municipal Committee Reported to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Jiangwan District of this city suffered the most damage in the recent war. The houses destroyed account for almost 80% or 90% of the houses. For the past few days, more than 100 villagers, bringing the old and the young, have been requesting relief from the municipal committee office in the district. It is reported that Committee Member Wu Xuen, according to the situation, telegraphed the municipal government and the Shanghai War Zone Relief Committee, requesting swift relief. The telegram is recorded below (excerpt):</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>"This afternoon, more than 100 villagers from the four villages of the district, bringing the old and the young, came to the office to request that houses be built on the spot and used the relief methods in the Dachang area of Baoshan County as proof (it was learned that universal relief was provided). The committee member politely declined and advised them, and there were no accidents. However, considering that Jiangwan suffered more than 100 times more damage than neighboring districts in this disaster, he has repeatedly requested swift relief in the name of the United Association of Compatriots in Distress. According to the previous situation, the committee member has no way to silence the people. Therefore, he urgently telegraphed this matter and respectfully requested relief and instructions on how to handle it." It is also reported that Committee Member Wu believed that the city government had exempted the Jiangwan district from this year's busy transportation tax but that the tenant farmers had not yet received practical benefits. He is preparing a document requesting instructions on how to reduce the rent.</p>
<h3>Congratulatory Telegrams Received by the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Since its establishment on Monday, the Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council has been actively preparing everything. However, because many councilors have not yet returned to Shanghai, it is temporarily impossible to hold a meeting. It is reported that the first meeting must be held by the end of this month at the latest. Yesterday, the Guangzhou Municipal Council sent a telegram congratulating the council, which read, "The Guangzhou Municipal Council to the Shanghai Municipal Government transferred to the Shanghai Special Municipality Council for inspection: Your council's establishment is a model of magnanimity. Hearing of this from afar, we are overjoyed. We will rely on your guidance and support in the future. We respectfully send this telegram to express our deepest regards. The Guangzhou Municipal Council, Xiao et al." Shanghai immediately replied with a telegram, saying, "To the Guangzhou Municipal Council for inspection: We have received your telegram with thanks. Our council is just beginning to be established, and we are just starting to discuss various matters. We are honored by your praise and are even more alarmed. We respectfully send this telegram to express our gratitude and hope that all the seniors will provide guidance at any time to correct our shortcomings. The Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council, seal."</p>
<h3>Sixteen Trade Associations Send a Letter to the City Chamber of Commerce Requesting the Prohibition of Customs Searches of Shops</h3>
<p>And Request a General Meeting of Members for Discussion</p>
<p>Sixteen trade associations in this city, including the Mineral Ash Factory Industry, the Lime Sales Industry, the Color Printing Industry, the Mercerized Cotton Velvet Industry, the Cotton Cloth Industry, the Sugar Industry, the Gunny Sack Cloth Industry, the Floss Industry, the Silk and Satin Industry, the Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry, the Paper Industry, the Intestine Industry, the Local Goods Industry, the Eyeglass Industry, the Watch and Clock Industry, and the North and South Goods Exchange Industry, jointly sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "Regarding the recent dispatch of personnel by the Jianghai Customs to search shops and demand verification of tax bills for goods in stock over the years, and confiscating goods if there are no tax bills. Even if foreign firm invoices are submitted for verification, they are deemed insufficient proof. It is heard that many have been punished. The majority of Shanghai shops purchase goods from foreign firms, and the foreign firms are responsible for the taxes. The invoices are the only proof of the goods. Even those who directly import goods from overseas with tax bills do not attach importance to the tax bills after the goods arrive because there is no clear order from the Jianghai Customs to require their safekeeping. Now, the customs has changed the rules without first notifying merchants to keep the tax bills and suddenly demanding that shops submit tax bills for goods in stock, while invoices are not sufficient proof. This makes law-abiding shops inevitably subject to unwarranted punishment, which is no different from punishing without teaching. Once a shop is searched, its business immediately comes to a standstill. All those who have transactions with the shop are panicked. The city's financial situation is chaotic. Thinking of this, everyone is in danger. Moreover, the fines amount to tens of thousands of yuan. At a time when all industries are declining, how can our merchants bear this? We have always admired your leadership of the merchants. At this time of emergency for the shops, we urge you to quickly telegraph the government to correct the customs' actions for relief and to convene a general meeting of members to discuss and seek a way to fundamentally secure the situation. This is in the public interest."</p>
<h3>Disaster Area Associations in Three Provinces Beg for Relief Telegram</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Provisional Charity Relief Association for the Disaster Areas of the Three Provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei telegraphed the provincial governments and department heads of the provinces according to the resolutions of the first executive and supervisory committee meeting, saying, "Previously, we received a letter from the Relief Committee informing us that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram asking us to collect funds in various ways to provide relief to the areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei that had been recovered for a long time and suffered severe disasters. Our colleagues immediately held meetings to discuss and decided to organize the Shanghai Provisional Charity Relief Association for the Disaster Areas of the Three Provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei according to the charity relief methods and began collecting funds immediately. However, the disaster area is vast and the number of disaster victims is very large. Without raising large sums of money, it is impossible to provide relief. Your government's benevolent administration and concern for the people are admired by all. We urge you to take pity on the disaster victims and widely promote the collection of large sums of money to rescue the disaster victims. We also ask you to order the county governments, chambers of commerce, and charity organizations to collect funds within a specified period and remit them to our association for distribution so that benevolent grain and righteous soup can flow continuously. The poor people of the three provinces will receive the blessings of rain and dew. We are awaiting your kind words. Chairman Xu Shiying, Vice Chairmen Wang Zhen and Wang Xiaolai of the Shanghai Provisional Charity Relief Association for the Disaster Areas of the Three Provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, hao." The telegram to the general chambers of commerce, chambers of commerce, charity organizations, professional organizations, and academic organizations in various places was generally the same and is omitted.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Donates to Northeast Refugees</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeast Refugees, it reported the association's charter and donation forms to various agencies, requesting them to promote the cause and widely solicit donations. The association has now received replies from the Jiangxi Provincial Government and the General Staff Headquarters, and donations have been collected. The two letters are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangxi Provincial Government: "Regarding your letter stating that our compatriots in the Northeast have suffered from both war and floods and are in urgent need of relief, and urging us to widely solicit donations, we are deeply moved by your concern for the hungry and drowning. We dare not spare any effort to help. However, our province has been plagued by bandits for a long time and lacks reserves. Disasters have occurred frequently for years, and small harvests cannot make up for them. The hardship of the survivors is equal to the displacement of those in the Northeast. This is not an exaggeration. We have long been grateful for your sympathy. Therefore, we are not in a position to open our mouths in various ways. We also know that collecting small amounts is useless, but considering the importance of the matter, we should try to repay the mission. We have delivered 500 yuan in cash to the Nanchang Central Bank for remittance and request that you inspect and receive it. We also hope to be informed of your response. The two donation forms will still be sent by mail. We are deeply grateful and hope you will understand."</p>
<p>General Staff Headquarters: "Regarding your letter and ten copies each of the charter report and two donation forms, requesting promotion and wide solicitation of donations, we have learned that our compatriots in the Northeast have suffered from war and floods and are extremely pitiful. Although our headquarters is short of funds, we should try our best to help. We have decided to donate 200 yuan and return the two donation books for your inspection and receipt. Please prepare a receipt and send it to the headquarters. We will send the donation immediately."</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Putian-Xianyou Relief Association to Petition in Beijing Tonight</h3>
<p>The Putian-Xianyou Township Relief Conference held its opening ceremony yesterday afternoon at the Xing'an Hall, followed by a preparatory meeting that lasted until 9:00 PM. It is reported that Huang Xingge, Shuo, and Chen Kan were elected as the presidium, and Huang Xingge, Zheng Shouyu, Yao Jieyu, Huang Hansheng, and Liu Shaocang were elected to the secretariat, responsible for reviewing proposals. Liu Shaocang and Cheng Kan were appointed as drafting committee members, and it was decided to hold the first general meeting at 2:00 PM tomorrow (today). Due to Bao Xianzu and others not yet being released from Min, a temporary motion was made to decide that representatives from various places would go to Beijing to petition tomorrow night. The general meeting will continue to be held after the representatives return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Zhu Lin and Others Scheduled to Welcome He Minhun</h3>
<p>He Minhun, the highest military leader of the anti-Japanese forces in Rehe, arrived in Shanghai the night before last. Citizens Zhu Lin, Wang Xingyong, Wu Zhiqian, Xiang Guozhong, Wei Yuelü, Huang Qiming, Geng Gongxia, Wang Yingming, and more than 50 others have initiated a welcome meeting to be held at the Youth Association this Sunday afternoon at 2:00 PM. The Teachers' Association of Secondary Schools, the Film Education Association, the National Endeavor Association, and the Xinhai Revolution Comrades Association will participate. It is reported that He has agreed to report on (1) the Japanese invasion of Rehe, (2) the organization and plans of the volunteer army, and (3) the latest situation of the anti-Japanese resistance in Rehe in order to awaken public awareness and increase the strength of the anti-Japanese forces.</p>
<h3>Unified Measures for Assisting the Volunteer Army by the Northeast Anti-Japanese Association</h3>
<p>Fears that Those Who Establish Separate Names and Engage in Activities Have Other Purposes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association has repeatedly received requests for assistance from the Northeast Mengbian National Salvation Army, the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Rebellion Army, and others. The association sent a letter to the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, asking it to conduct a thorough investigation for reference. The replies were received yesterday as follows: (1) "Regarding your letter stating that the Northeast Mengbian National Salvation Army Commander Feng Guanxiong and Deputy Commander Liu Yuyuan reported on their combat experience over the past year and requested assistance, we have found no record of the location of the unit's defense area or the number of units under its command in our files. We asked them to clarify the situation and reply to us for consideration. We have found no Northeast Mengbian National Salvation Army under the command of our association's volunteer army, and there are no Feng Guanxiong and Liu Yuyuan among our members. We have only seen publicity texts from these officers in the newspapers. If the unit has actual strength and has actually fought in the field for a year, it would not be out of touch with our association. Therefore, we are not sure whether the claims are true and can ignore them. Regarding the above, we hereby reply for your information." (2) "Regarding your letter stating that the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Rebellion Army representative in Shanghai, Hong Yaodou, reported on the attack on Shenyang and requested assistance to launch another attack, we have not seen the name of the army before, and the description of the battle situation is quite different. We asked them to clarify the situation and reply to us for consideration. We have found no Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Rebellion Army under the command of our association's volunteer army, and the description of the battle situation does not match the facts. The Shenyang area has now been assigned to the Sixth Army of the Northeast Volunteer Army under the command of Xiong Hui. All work in the area will be under the command of Commander Xiong to ensure accountability. In addition, our association has unified measures for assisting the volunteer armies, providing assistance separately. We are concerned that those who establish separate names and engage in activities have other purposes. Please ignore them. Regarding the above, we hereby reply for your information."</p>
<h3>Two Theatres Perform to Support the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>The personnel of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway lines have jointly established the "Donation Raising Committee for the Northeast Volunteer Army of the Two Railway Lines" to donate funds to the Northeast Volunteer Army. On the afternoon of the 18th, at 3:00 PM, Zheng Shizhao, the Director of the Transportation Department, was elected to convene the first meeting at the Transportation Department. It was decided that colleagues from this railway line would perform Peking Opera, scheduled to travel to Shanghai, Beijing, Changzhou, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places to raise funds through performances. Matters such as theatrical affairs and ticket sales are currently being actively carried out, with the aim of raising substantial funds in the shortest possible time and remitting them to the Northeast to assist our brave soldiers fighting on the frontiers.</p>

<h3>Customs' Chinese Star Patrol Vessel Completed</h3>
<p>Already Received and Put into Use Yesterday</p>
<p>Due to rampant piracy off the Jianghai Customs, two patrol vessels were specially commissioned from the Jiangnan Shipyard to increase police strength. The Chinese Star vessel was fully completed the day before yesterday after being launched, and all artillery positions were also fully installed. The shipyard notified the Customs, so the Customs dispatched personnel to the shipyard yesterday to negotiate the handover procedures. Ye Zaifu, the head of the shipbuilding department of the shipyard, handed over all parts of the vessel to the Customs personnel for acceptance. The vessel also set sail from Gaochangmiao and berthed in front of Lujiazui.</p>
<h3>International Settlement Volunteer Corps Adds Air Defense Unit</h3>
<p>According to the Municipal Council Gazette, the International Settlement Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession established an air defense unit starting on the 18th of this month, under the command of Lieutenant Holland. This unit is composed of members of the machine gun group of the Light Cavalry Corps, just as the US Marine Corps machine gun unit is composed of the Lewis gun group of the US Marine Corps. Most of the personnel in the machine gun group of the Light Cavalry Corps are members of the Air Force Association, and the International Settlement Volunteer Corps has not yet had a team specializing in air defense research. Therefore, it is appropriate to form a new team with this group. The uniforms of this team will be largely the same as the uniforms of the British Air Force in 1914.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Company's Labor Strike Negotiations Ineffective</h3>
<p>Party and Government Organs to Mediate</p>
<p>Since the British-owned Taikoo Steamship Company stipulated standards for the middle cabin workers on the Yangtze River routes, it will inevitably reduce workers, which has aroused the public anger of all seamen. In addition to sending personnel to Beijing to petition, the Seamen's Union also sent Zhou Youting and others, along with Xie Baosheng and others from the China Navigation Mutual Aid Association, to conduct four direct negotiations on September 26, 29, October 4, and 14, but to no avail. In addition, the company's implementation period is approaching, resulting in a serious situation. The China Navigation Mutual Aid Association has reported the situation to the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, requesting prompt mediation to avoid major strikes at that time and affect navigation. It is reported that the party and government organs will discuss measures and assume the role of mediation.</p>
<h3>Armed Police Protect Chinese Merchants' Trams</h3>
<p>Due to labor disputes at the Chinese Merchants' Electric Company, employee conflicts occurred. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, deeply concerned about accidents, dispatched a police brigade to be stationed at the company. In addition, the fourth security police squadron stationed at the Chao Hui Hall and Maojia Nong was ordered to dispatch armed police to protect each tram starting yesterday (20th).</p>
<h3>Extraterritorial Road Section Telephone Negotiations Nearing Resolution</h3>
<p>Both Sides are Close to Agreement</p>
<p>New Contract May be Signed Soon</p>
<p>The issue of installing concession telephones in the extraterritorial road sections of this city has been negotiated by this municipal government and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications with the Public Concession Municipal Council and the Shanghai Telephone Company for several times. Both sides are already close to agreement. According to reliable sources, the draft of the new installation contract has been submitted to the municipal government for approval after being drafted by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. The spokesperson of the municipal government told the reporter of the Central News Agency that what the municipal government cannot concede is a matter of sovereignty. Now the concession authorities have been able to accept the opinions of the municipal government, so it can be completely resolved in the near future. A final meeting of all relevant parties will be convened in about the next few days. If there are no objections at that time, the new contract can be signed.</p>
<h3>Road Association Concludes Membership Drive</h3>

<h3>Leprosy Relief Association Requests Enactment of Special Laws and Regulations</h3>
<p>A petition is submitted requesting the enactment of laws and regulations on leprosy to provide relief and prevent its spread. Leprosy has long been considered a malignant disease. Because the public has not paid attention and the government has not enacted special laws, the disease has spread wider and its harm has become more severe. Its impact on national health and the future of the nation is indeed significant. Yuan Xinzhi and Jian Zhijian, witnessing this with heartache, initiated the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association in 1926 to promote relief. After its establishment, it cooperated with the International Leprosy Relief Association and the American Leprosy Relief Association to carry out activities, especially sparing no effort in establishing and funding leprosy hospitals, compiling and printing publications, and conducting publicity, in order to arouse the attention of the people and achieve the goal of eradicating leprosy. They also noted that European and American countries all</p>
<p>have enacted laws regarding leprosy, so that patients can receive appropriate isolation and treatment, so as to control transmission and achieve therapeutic effects. In contrast, our country is still trapped in superstition, believing that those who suffer from this disease are suffering the consequences of sins in their previous lives, without pity, and arbitrarily killing them. Such situations are extremely wrong. The five-province health conference convened by your department (December 26, 1928) has already passed the proposal to enact leprosy laws and build leprosy hospitals, which shows that your department has a compassionate attitude and treats the people as if they were injured. However, it has been a long time, and this law has not yet been enacted and implemented. The National Leprosy Conference held on October 5th and 6th opened in Shanghai, and experts from China and abroad gathered on the sea. They all advocated requesting your department to enact special leprosy laws and regulations and promulgate them for implementation as soon as possible. This was also discussed and approved as item 4 of the roundtable meeting held at 2:00 PM on October 6th (the second day of the conference): "The proposal to request the government to enact special laws and regulations on leprosy was resolved and handed over to the board of directors of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association for handling." Therefore, a special petition is submitted to your department, requesting that leprosy laws be enacted and promulgated for implementation as soon as possible, so that millions of victims can be relieved, and the disaster of its spread can also be prevented, which is of great benefit to the future of the nation. We are in urgent need of your reply. Respectfully submitted to Liu, the Director of the Department of Health, Li Yuanxin, the Chairman of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, and Wu Zhijian, the General Secretary. Respectfully submitted on October 18, 1932.</p>
<h3>National Products Exhibition to Close</h3>
<p>Scheduled to End on the 23rd</p>
<p>The National Products Exhibition, organized by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, has been open since National Day. People from all walks of life have been visiting every day, and the situation has been very enthusiastic. The business of the participating factories and shops has also been very prosperous. The exhibition was originally scheduled to last for two weeks, but it would be extended if necessary. Cao Zhendong, the director-general of the exhibition, said that the operating expenses of the exhibition are entirely provided by the government. The rent and advertising fees of the participating manufacturers are not charged, and only a weekly fee of five silver dollars for water and electricity is charged. If the closing date is extended, the expenses will inevitably exceed the budget, which is actually very difficult. Therefore, it has been decided to follow the scheduled date and close the exhibition on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemums in Full Bloom at the Municipal Garden and Nursery</h3>
<p>The planting of chrysanthemums in the Municipal Garden and Nursery of this city has been going on for years, and it is well known to the people of Shanghai. This year, the garden has collected even more varieties, reaching more than 500, totaling 7,000 to 8,000 plants. Recently, they are blooming vigorously, with a dazzling array of colors, which is quite beautiful. Many famous varieties have been carefully collected and efforts have been made to study cultivation methods. For the sake of the public, all those that are not kept for breeding can be sold at low prices. Those who have a penchant for Yuanming (Tao Yuanming) should visit it. The garden is located along the river and by the sea, with natural beauty, fresh air, and convenient transportation. Stepping into it will surely make people feel refreshed. It is truly a scenic spot in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yu Tang in the County Initiates Chrysanthemum Exhibition</h3>
<p>Thousands of Rare Varieties Stretching for Four Li</p>
<p>Exhibition to be Held for Three Days Starting Next Month on the 4th</p>
<p>Yu Tang Town, located 50 li from Shanghai along the Songjiang Road, belongs to the county and is the hometown of Niu Yongjian, the Vice President of the Examination Yuan. In recent years, the Qiang Shu Horticultural School, the Yu Tang Public Education Center, and the Rural Experimental Area Cooperative have been established, becoming a distinctive new village. Great attention has been paid to the facilities for national training, the rectification of village appearance, and the promotion of horticulture. Now that the chrysanthemums are in full bloom, chrysanthemums have been arranged along the Songjiang Road, stretching for more than four li. It has been decided to open the exhibition to the public for three days on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of next month. The abundance of varieties and the novelty of colors are truly rare everywhere. They are also willing to sell them at low prices for the benefit of fellow enthusiasts. It is expected that there will be a bustling scene with many visitors at that time.</p>
<h3>French Concession Cracks Down on Wireless Broadcasting Stations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that there are no less than 40 wireless broadcasting stations in this port. Due to the lack of appropriate management by the local authorities, the wavelength and broadcasting programs often cause interference, and there are even hostile stations that deliberately obstruct each other, causing great harm to listeners. If this is not remedied for a long time, it will quickly fall into chaos. In view of this, the authorities of the French Concession have issued regulations by the French Consul General, stipulating that all radio stations within the concession must be registered immediately and obtain licenses from the Public Works Bureau in accordance with the licensing regulations. When applying for a license, the location of the radio station, the purpose of its establishment, the names of all employees, fire prevention and sanitation designs, and the station's drawings must be stated in detail, and written evidence of the Consul General's approval must be attached. Police officers can enter and inspect at any time, and if there is any violation, they can be ordered to stop operating immediately to facilitate supervision and management. However, most of the current wireless broadcasting stations are located in the Public Concession, and it is hoped that the Public Concession authorities will cooperate with the French Concession and follow up on supervision to eliminate the malpractices in the wireless broadcasting industry.</p>
<h3>Entomologist Fei Gengyu Passes Away</h3>
<p>Fei Guxiang, styled Gengyu, was a native of Haining, Zhejiang, and a famous entomologist. He served as an entomology instructor at the Second Agricultural School of Jiangsu for many years, as well as a member of the Jiangsu Rice Borer Control Committee. In 1921, he founded the Zhejiang Provincial Entomology Bureau, serving as both the Director and Technician. He dedicated himself to his duties for six years, laying the foundation for the insect control industry in Zhejiang, and his efforts were quite successful. At that time, the provincial government issued an order to commend him, and the farmers of the province also praised him. Later, he became ill due to overwork and retired as a technician to reduce his workload, but his illness worsened. However, he still devoted himself to research, publishing many works one after another. On the advice of doctors, he resigned from his job and recuperated in his hometown of Xia Shi. Unfortunately, he passed away on the 8th of this month at the age of only 37. He was gifted, and his knowledge of entomology was entirely self-taught. He was proficient in English and German, and often corresponded with entomologists around the world. His posthumous works include a study of the English treehopper and a record of the butterflies of West Lake in English, which have not yet been published. The Chinese entomological community is saddened by the loss of this scholar.</p>

<h3>Telephone Price Increase Issue</h3>
<p>Statement by Investigator Anson</p>
<p>On June 24 of this year, the Municipal Council published a statement in the gazette regarding the telephone price increase, stating that the Municipal Council granted the company's request to increase prices according to the ratio recommended in Anson's 1929 report, with slight supplements to make it feasible. Recently, Anson sent a letter from London to Chung Sze-kwan, the Chief Secretary of the Municipal Council, regarding this matter: "I have read the Municipal Council's gazette of June 24 and saw in your statement that 'Anson's proposal has significant shortcomings. If the various items in the report are implemented literally, the company will lose the benefits that Anson wanted to give.' I find it difficult to remain silent on this matter. In Section 12 of my original report, I stated that 'The proposed price increase can only be regarded as a temporary and satisfactory solution.' After three years of delay, the situation has changed a lot. At the time of my investigation, I did see a general need for a 25% increase. If I were to be asked to consider this matter again today, I would suggest a method that would allow the company to obtain the same value as the 1929 recommendation. The three years of delay in the middle (originally intended to test whether the company could fulfill its promises) should not cause the company to suffer losses. Therefore, it should be given a higher increase rate than 25% today to recover the losses in the past few years. However, the above-mentioned changes in Shanghai's economic situation during this period have not been taken into account. I am far away in England and have no way to discuss how these changes have affected telephone prices. I would be grateful if this letter could be forwarded to your board of directors."</p>
<h3>Assassination of Wu Guangzong Case</h3>
<p>The Accused Were Escorted to the Municipal Public Safety Bureau Yesterday</p>
<p>Li Nianyuan, a detective chief of the Second Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Team, and Pang Yutang, a Chinese detective from the Old Zha Patrol Station of the Public Concession, etc., arrested Song Jiande, Wu Jigui, Zhang Shaoliang, Yao Jechen, and four other suspects in the case of the murder of Lu, the police chief of the Changxing Coal Mine Bureau, at locations such as the Majestic Hotel. Two "box cannon" pistols with the seal of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau were confiscated. It was also discovered that Wu Guangzong, the Director of the Hydrographic Office of the Navy Department, was also targeted by them. Song and the others confessed that Zhou Mingshan (also known as Zhou Asi) and Zhang Changlin (also known as Zhang Baiyin), both detectives from the Zhejiang Provincial Security Team, were the masterminds. The patrol station and the Municipal Public Safety Bureau first apprehended Zhou and Zhang. It was found that they had also committed robbery cases in the Public Concession: (1) the home of Chen Rongsheng at 1040 Wuzhou Road, (2) the home of Chen Xingsheng at 14 North Suzhou Road. The patrol station first prosecuted Song and the other six suspects for the theft cases. The First Special Court had interrogated them several times, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Feng Shide, the criminal judge of the Special Court, continued the interrogation. Ru Baoyi, the patrol station's lawyer, stated the details of the case and the articles of prosecution. Then, the victims and witnesses successively filed reports and identified the suspects. Later, Li Nianyuan of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Team requested a transfer of custody. Zhan Jifeng, a lawyer and legal advisor to the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, also appeared in court, stating that the criminal acts of the defendants in the assassination of Wu Guangzong were committed within the Chinese territory of this city. According to Article 13 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the trial jurisdiction of the defendants should belong to the court in Shanghai. He requested permission to transfer the defendants to the Public Safety Bureau for interrogation. Judge Feng then questioned each defendant one by one and announced the verdict: Song Jiande was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, Zhang Shaoliang to seven years, Yao Jechen to five years, and Zhang Changlin to six months. The number of days of detention before the verdict was finalized would be offset against the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. Zhou Mingshan was found not guilty. Song Jiande, Wu Jigui, Zhang Shaoliang, Yao Jechen, Zhou Mingshan, and Zhang Changlin, along with the guns and bullets, were all handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau to be taken into custody for interrogation. Song and the other six suspects were then escorted away by Gu Liancheng, the squad leader of the Public Safety Bureau's detective team.</p>
<h3>Police-Civilian Conflict in Maqiao Town Resolved</h3>
<p>Quarrel over Gambling Leads to Strike</p>
<p>Police Station Smashed, Police Officers Beaten</p>
<p>All Shops in the Town Resumed Business Yesterday</p>
<p>The police-civilian conflict in Maqiao Town, a southwestern suburb of this city, was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, some of the facts reported were slightly inaccurate. Here is what we have learned from our investigation: On the 18th day of the ninth month of the Jiazi year [1924], the town suffered from the Qi-Lu War, and the merchants and residents suffered significant losses. Therefore, on each anniversary of that day, there was a local commemoration, and temporary vendors were set up, which was quite a spectacle. This autumn, a Shaoxing opera troupe was hired to perform for three days from the 16th to the 18th of this month, and an extra day was added on the 19th. Therefore, more men and women from all directions came to watch than in previous years. Wang Jun, the director of the Sixth Branch of the County Public Safety Bureau in charge, fearing that it would disrupt public order, politely advised against it. However, after repeated requests from the business community, and considering the custom in the countryside for many years, he found it difficult to refuse out of consideration for personal relationships. He then reported the situation to the bureau chief for approval. At 8:15 p.m. on the 18th, it was reported that there was gambling and commission drawing in the Central Teahouse opened by Ma Fulan and Zhang Quansheng at No. 54 in the town. Director Wang sent Bureau Officer Zhao Wanli and Patrol Chief Liu Yongjiang to lead police to arrest the gamblers. Unexpectedly, before the police reached the entrance of the gambling den, Zhang Zhonghua (the landlord of the Central Teahouse), the owner of the Yisheng Grocery Store behind, sounded the gong to warn the gamblers. The gamblers, hearing the alarm, thought it was a fire and fled outwards. Director Wang also heard the sound and rushed to the scene. After inspecting the surroundings and finding no sign of fire, he took the gamblers Pan Bingsheng, Zhang Chengquan, and Jiang Xianglin to the bureau (one of them was bailed out by the Chamber of Commerce). This arrest of gamblers caused a quarrel, leading to misunderstandings and resentment. Yesterday morning (the 19th), all the shops in the town went on strike in unison. In the afternoon, there was supposed to be an extra day of opera, so spectators from other places were still coming in a continuous stream. As more and more people gathered, they could not help but vent their anger on the Public Safety Bureau, and Director Wang became the target of public criticism. With a single voice, they marched to the office of the Sixth Branch Bureau in front of the City God Temple in the town. First, they snatched the firearms of the guards Zhu Baoshu and Zuo Xuebin and beat them on the head, legs, and back in multiple places. Because Director Wang saw that all the shops in the town were on strike, he had taken an early car to Shanghai to see the bureau chief and ask for instructions, so he did not suffer the humiliation of the crowd. The crowd then piled all the files in the bureau and Wang's bedding, clothes, and other belongings at the entrance of the bureau and burned them all. The portrait of Sun Yat-sen was also torn down. They then broke into the bedrooms of the police officers upstairs and smashed everything. Fortunately, the chief police officer deeply understood the situation and did not resist. (Yesterday's newspaper mistakenly reported that they opened fire to demonstrate and injured many farmers, which was not true.) Later, the Sixth Security Regiment heard the alarm and arrived at the scene to suppress the crowd, who then dispersed. After the incident, it was found that one Mauser rifle, one eight-inch pistol, three bayonets, more than two hundred rounds of ammunition, and clothing and silver dollars belonging to the police officers, worth about several hundred yuan, were lost. The five injured police officers, Song Xueshu, Zuo Xuebin, Wang Tiekai, Kong Qingbao, and Yang Pei, were immediately sent to a Shanghai hospital for treatment. After the incident, the County Public Safety Bureau immediately sent Yao Fusheng, the chief of the Public Security Section, and Ji Yi, the chief inspector, along with armed police officers, to maintain order. The night before last, they went to the town's Chamber of Commerce President Yang Shunfan, Sixth District Chief Wang Chengyao, County Party Department Zhang Jingye, District Party Department Sun Jianjun, He Shoumei, Lu Huisheng, and business community representatives Yan Dianyu, Shen Hongwen, Jiao Yongyu, etc., and held an emergency meeting to resolve the aftermath. On one hand, they first issued a notice to resume business, so yesterday morning, all the shops in the town opened as usual. The temporary police officers who were sent were also immediately withdrawn to their original defenses. During the turmoil, two gambling criminals were released by the crowd, and a certain Jia was arrested for arson and robbery, and Director Wang's leather suitcase was seized on the spot. The storm finally subsided.</p>
<h3>Wife Forced to Divorce, Angered and Commits Suicide by Slitting Her Throat</h3>
<p>The Way of Husband and Wife is Bitter</p>
<p>Yu Ye, a woman of twenty years old, lived at No. 1426 Yangshupu Road. Her husband, Yu Zhenrong, was not on good terms with her and lived separately in Wusuo Road, Zhabei. He had previously gathered several people to negotiate with her, wanting to end the marital relationship and forcing her to sign a divorce agreement. The woman was extremely angry. On the evening of the 11th of this month, at 6:00 p.m., she slit her throat with a kitchen knife. Her roommate, Ru Xiaoqiang, caught a glimpse of it and quickly snatched the sharp weapon, but her throat had already been severely cut, and blood gushed out like a spring. She was immediately reported to the local patrol station, which sent detectives to the scene and rushed Yu Ye to Guangren Hospital for treatment. She died from her injuries the night before last. After receiving the report, the patrol station ordered detectives to carry the body to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, came to the office to conduct a forensic examination. During the court hearing, the witness Ru Xiaoqiang stated that the deceased was her roommate. She went upstairs, and on that day, she saw her coming downstairs with blood on her neck and a kitchen knife in her hand. She was shocked and quickly snatched the knife and reported it to the patrol station, etc. Shi Jiwan also surrendered himself, stating that he was from Yuyao and the deceased was his cousin. He had already negotiated with the aunt of the deceased and had filed a lawsuit with the local court, etc. Prosecutor Guo then stated that the deceased Yu Ye had indeed committed suicide with a knife, and the body was handed over to Shi Jiwan with a guarantee to take it back for burial. The kitchen knife was stored in the court's property depot.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Report Republished</h3>
<p>The Great Contribution of Shen Bao</p>
<p>The Chinese version of the League of Nations Report, edited and printed by Shen Bao, is a complete book of more than one hundred and fifty pages, totaling one hundred and sixty thousand words. In addition to the full text of the report, it also includes the opinions of newspapers and celebrities from various countries around the world for mutual reference, which is the most distinctive feature. The first edition of ten thousand copies was sold out yesterday. In order to promote the attention of the Chinese people to the Manchurian Incident, the company decided to reprint ten thousand copies at no cost to spread it widely. However, the purpose of the company in editing and printing this book was originally to arouse readers' deep attention to the Manchurian question. Now, seeing that the first edition has just been sold out, and various bookstores in this city have printed and sold this book one after another, it is sufficient to prove the concern of the Chinese people for diplomacy. The company is not using this to make profits. Now that the original intention has been achieved, it has been decided not to print any more after the second edition is sold out. The second edition will still be sold from today at the Shen Bao office on Hankou Road, the Xinwen Bao office, the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road, the Eight Immortals Bridge, the Jing'an Temple Road, and various branches and bookstores. The actual price is fifty cents, without any discount. The combined Chinese-English edition is a thick book of about four hundred sixteen open pages. It is currently being printed and will be published within a week. The special price is only one silver dollar, which is an unprecedented initiative in the publishing industry this year. Even in terms of the English part alone, compared with those on the market, it is only one-third of their price, and it is a combined Chinese-English edition, well-printed, and easy to read. Those who like to read the original English version should regard this as the best. Special price coupons are available at the above-mentioned sales locations.</p>
<h3>Key Suspects in the Assassination of Wang Bin</h3>
<p>Tried at the Third Branch of the High Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Wang Bin, an inspector of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters Detective Team, and Cao Qingcheng, an inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau, were assassinated by enemies in Vilmont Road and Jia Le Road in the French Concession this summer, one after the other. When Cao was killed, the murderer mistakenly identified Jin Shoupei from Jiangwan as Cao because they looked alike, resulting in his accidental death. Later, detectives from the French patrol station successively arrested four key suspects, Liu Guobao from Sichuan, Li Shiying from Henan, Zhu Jinming from Hangzhou, and Li Zhexia from Anhui, and confiscated items such as handguns and bullets. They were first escorted to the Second Special Court, and a public prosecution was filed according to law. After interrogation, it was ruled that the case was related to political jurisdiction and was transferred to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for trial. The Third Branch of the High Court accepted the case and opened several investigation hearings, deeming them to be concluded. Yesterday, the patrol station detectives and the victims' family members, as well as witnesses, were summoned to the court. At 3:00 p.m., Judge Zhou Yunhui, together with Assessors Guo Dezhang and Zhao Zhenhai, and Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei and Clerk Huang Lixiang, arrived at the Third Criminal Court for a formal trial. The Police Department was represented by Lawyer Yuan Jiahong, and the defendants also hired lawyers to appear in court to defend them. Because public attendance was prohibited, the details of the interrogation could not be recorded. As a result, the court ordered a postponement for further hearing, and the defendants were still held in custody separately.</p>

<h3>Huang Zicheng Ordered to Go to Hankou to Escort Criminals</h3>
<p>Ling Jiannan, a resident of Chuansha, Ningkang Lane, Ximen, was killed by Wang Wencai and others. The accomplice, Chen Tugeng, escaped from the detention center of the local court, causing a major dispute. The case involved Huang Zicheng, an inspector of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, who is currently not in Shanghai. According to a statement from someone in the Inspectorate, Huang Zicheng was ordered by Wen, the director of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, to escort eight accomplices to Hankou.</p>
<h3>Chairman Bell of the Shanghai Municipal Council Sends Letter of Thanks to the Portuguese Consul General</h3>
<p>And Asks the Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to Convey Congratulations</p>
<p>Chairman Bell of the Shanghai Municipal Council sent a letter to the Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai yesterday, stating that the Qing Envoy had previously presented the Christ Medal to the Portuguese detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. He, on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Council, expressed his deep gratitude for this honor. The Council was greatly pleased that the government of Portugal had given such high recognition to the Portuguese detachment for its service to the public in Shanghai. During the previous martial law period, the Portuguese detachment was ordered to mobilize, and the individual members of the detachment made great sacrifices. The detachment's loyalty and diligence in ensuring public order under difficult and dangerous circumstances were truly worthy of gratitude from all residents of the city, etc. Chairman Bell had also asked Lieutenant Colonel Thomas, the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, to convey the congratulations of the Shanghai Municipal Council to the detachment and expressed that the Council was deeply grateful for the detachment members' dedication to public service, even though their homes were close to the war zone, without any concerns.</p>
<h3>Qin Aifang Counter-Sues Huang Jianliang</h3>
<p>Huang and Aifang Signed Two Kinds of Contracts</p>
<p>One Acknowledges Her as His Wife, One Sets a Deadline for Marriage</p>
<p>Qin Aifang, a woman from Jiading currently residing at No. 61 Zhoushan Road, cohabitated with Huang Jianliang, a Shanghainese construction supervisor at the Chuangxin Construction Factory, in 1928 due to love. Recently, because Huang neglected to provide for her, Qin Aifang sued him in the First Special District Court for seduction and abandonment. After Judge Wu Tingqi heard the case, he ordered the criminal part of the case to be suspended because Huang had already filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court to terminate the relationship. After receiving this ruling, Qin Aifang immediately entrusted Lawyer Yu Congdao to file an appeal. Yesterday was the date for Huang's lawsuit against Qin to terminate the relationship. The case was heard in the Civil Court's Seventh Division. The defendant's side requested that the civil lawsuit be suspended, but the court did not allow it. Therefore, the defendant has now presented reasons for defense and filed a counter-suit. The counter-suit states: "I, the counter-plaintiff, was seduced and bewitched by the original plaintiff, Huang Jianliang, in many ways. At that time, I was only eighteen years old and weak-willed, and I eventually became reckless. Initially, the original plaintiff falsely promised to make me his official wife. Therefore, on the second day of the seventh lunar month of 1928, I voluntarily signed a contract acknowledging me as his official wife. Then, the original plaintiff falsely promised to marry me soon. Therefore, on the twenty-third day of the ninth lunar month of 1929, I voluntarily signed a contract setting a deadline for marriage. These are all the circumstances when the original plaintiff and I were together. However, the original plaintiff became tired of me over time and regarded me as a thorn in his side, subjecting me to various illegal abuses that are unspeakable. Without mentioning the distant past, as recently as the evening of the fourteenth day of the seventh lunar month of this year, the original plaintiff used both hands to tightly strangle my throat and took advantage of the situation to kick me hard in the waist with his leather shoes, causing serious injuries and tearing several pieces of clothing. There is a bundle of torn clothes as proof. After I cried and complained to my father, he rebuked him, and he bought some medicated ointment to apply. Later, because the injury did not heal, my father accompanied me to the Min Injury Clinic for treatment. Afterwards, the original plaintiff came to my father's house to apologize. Because I remembered our years of marital relationship, I did not investigate the matter deeply. However, not only did he not know how to repent, but on the nineteenth day of the ninth lunar month of this year, he took three hundred yuan from my exclusive savings (which were stored in my father's Yuanxing Lumber Company) without authorization and spent it privately. He disappeared and did not return. After searching everywhere, I was unable to meet him. On the twenty-second day of the same month, I suddenly received a summons from your court and learned that the original plaintiff intended to abandon me. He fabricated that I had been fierce in the past and colluded with my enemy, Chen Juquan, to give false testimony. He also falsely claimed that my father and I had forced him to borrow six hundred yuan without success and even dared to say that the two written contracts, which he had voluntarily signed, were drafted in advance while my father and I had him drunk and forced him to sign them. This is truly an unprecedented tale. If what he said is true, if he was forced to sign them while drunk in 1928, why would he be forced to sign a second one while drunk again in 1929? The original plaintiff is not made of clay or wood. How could he be fooled again and again? And since he claims to have been drunk, he should have been muddled. Why are the characters in the contract written so neatly and meticulously? Moreover, how could I know the original plaintiff's family trivia? Even if it were after the fact, why didn't the original plaintiff publish a notice to cancel the contract or file a criminal lawsuit to investigate it? He only mentioned it today, which is obviously deceiving himself and trying to cover up the truth. Even if we take a step back, if the contract was not signed, and the original plaintiff recognizes me as his concubine, he should be responsible for alimony if he wants to terminate the relationship. Otherwise, he brings me here and then dismisses me. What rights do women have? Therefore, in addition to filing a complaint with your court's Criminal Division, I also request that your court reject the original plaintiff's lawsuit and order the original plaintiff to pay 7,500 yuan in retirement expenses and 300 yuan for the borrowed money he used privately, as well as 2,100 yuan in consolation money, based on the contract. If this cannot be approved, then order a one-time payment of 9,900 yuan in alimony based on the contract submitted by the original plaintiff."</p>
<h3>Forensic Examination of a Child Burned to Death in a Fire on Taurfeis Road</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 18th, a fire broke out at the printing shop opened by Shi Ajin at No. 17 and 18, Nanshen Lane, Side Lane, No. 41 Taurfeis Road in the French Concession, destroying two rooms. It is now known that mahjong was being played downstairs in the printing shop that evening, and Shi's four-year-old daughter, Yuying, was already asleep. The fire was caused by a tipped-over kerosene lamp. By the time Shi's wife noticed, the flames had filled the room. The child was sleeping in bed and could not be rescued. She was buried in the fire pit. It was not until 9:00 a.m. the next morning that the firefighters dug out the body. It was charred and had incomplete limbs, which was a tragic sight. The body was immediately taken to the forensic examination office of the Tongren Fuyuantang Branch. At that time, the local patrol station sent detectives to investigate the cause of the fire. Shi Ajin, the owner of the shop, had already fled, and only his wife, Shi Shi, was taken to the patrol station for questioning. Yesterday, the patrol station reported to the Second Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Deng Baosun to conduct a forensic examination. It was confirmed that the body was burned to death. According to the report of the Bao detective, the official stated that the body would be handed over to the family members with a guarantee for burial.</p>
<h3>Forensic Examination of a Man Who Committed Suicide by Poisoning in the Xinhuizhong Hotel</h3>
<p>Although the Wife Was Rescued, Her Situation is Pitiful</p>
<p>Patrol Station Colleagues Donate Money for the Coffin</p>
<p>Zhu Zhiming, a 25-year-old man from Suzhou, used to run a foreign goods store in his hometown. Later, due to business failure and the successive deaths of his parents, he was heavily in debt. Zhu was particularly unable to turn things around and was very distressed. On the 16th of this month, he came to Shanghai with his wife, Wang, and rented a room at the Xinhuizhong Hotel on Hankou Road. After booking a room, the two of them took poison together. At that time, one died and one lived, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. After investigation by the Old Zha Patrol Station, Fan Zhiming's body was taken to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road, and the rescued Wang was taken back to the patrol station. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court was notified, and Prosecutor Guo Wei was appointed to conduct a forensic examination. During the court hearing, Zhu Wang stated that she was 24 years old and the deceased was her legal husband. They got married and lived together on the ninth day of the third lunar month of the previous year. They used to live in the gate of Suzhou and ran a shop there. Recently, due to the closure of the shop, the economy was extremely difficult. Therefore, her husband and she came to Shanghai together. At that time, she and her husband went to buy opium and ingested it. He was the one who initiated it. Now, she is willing to return home, etc. After receiving the statement, Guo Jun, fearing that she would commit suicide again, earnestly advised her not to repeat the old tragedy. Later, the West Deputy Head stated that he had already escorted Zhu Wang to the First Special Court and had been instructed to send the woman to the Women and Children's Relief Association. Guo Jun then stated that the deceased Zhu Zhiming had indeed died of opium poisoning. The body was handed over to his wife, Zhu Wang, with a guarantee to take it back for burial. It is heard that there is no one left in Zhu Zhiming's family, and Zhu Wang is left alone, but she has no money. Therefore, the colleagues in the patrol station, seeing the pity of this matter, voluntarily donated money for the coffin and all other expenses.</p>
<h3>Suspect Wang Yiying Arrested in the Case of the Murder of a Dance Hall Girl's Family</h3>
<p>The Girl Died Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Boy's Injuries Are Still Severe</p>
<p>Liang Xiuzhen and Li Huiqing, Cantonese dance hall girls at the Anle Palace Dance Hall, lived together in a pavilion at No. 263 Changyuan Lane, Haining Road. On the morning before last, at about 1:00 a.m., the mother of Xiuzhen, Liang Li, and her students, Zilun, younger sister Qiaolan, and Li Huiqing's adopted son, Dong Lijiao, were stabbed by the enemy Tian Duhuo. The murderer escaped on the spot. After receiving the report, the Hongkou Patrol Station sent Chief Detective Wei Jinfu and West Detective to investigate. The injured were sent to Tongren Guangci Hospital for treatment. Liang Li and Dong Liguang died from their injuries, and their bodies were sent to the forensic examination office for examination. It is now known that the detectives in charge of this case have arrested the suspect Wang Yiying and escorted him to the patrol station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Shen Bingrong conducted the preliminary hearing. Zhang Tianyin, the patrol station's lawyer, stated the details of the case, stating that after the case occurred, it was learned that the defendant Wang Yiying was Wang Jigeng, 21 years old, from Shaoxing, living at No. 20 Dekang Lane, Fusheng Road, Bazilu. Detectives were sent to arrest him, but he was already gone. His brother, Wang Jisheng, was arrested and questioned and found to be unrelated, so he was released. His wife, due to panic, confessed that the defendant Wang Yiying was staying at the Da Hu Hotel in the French Concession. Detectives were sent to arrest the defendant. It was found that the defendant had been working as a bookkeeper at the Jin Ying Dance Hall on Qiujiang Road a year ago. At that time, Li Huiqing went to the dance hall to dance, and they became acquainted. The relationship between the two sides was very close. Recently, Li heard the words of others and broke away from the defendant. Li delivered two letters, threatening words. However, it is not certain whether the defendant is the main culprit. It was found that before the case occurred, at about 10:00 p.m. on the 18th, a certain Jia, speaking Cantonese, came to the door of the victims' house and called out for Li Huiqing. The second landlord, He Wang, asked what was the matter. The Jia said that he wanted Li to dance. Because Li had already gone out, the Jia left. When the incident occurred, He Wang heard someone shouting in the pavilion. She suspected that Liang Li was beating her son. After a while, she heard Liang Li calling for help. She got up to check and saw a person dressed in black jumping out of the window and escaping. Currently, He Wang, Liang Xiuzhen, etc. have not been brought to justice and should be detained. The boy, Zilun, who is being treated in the hospital, is still seriously injured. The girl, Qiaolan, died of her injuries at 2:00 a.m. this morning, etc. Judge Shen then questioned the defendant and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further hearing. At about 10:00 a.m., Prosecutor Guo Wei from the Special Court came to the forensic examination office and confirmed that the deceased girl, Qiaolan, had indeed been stabbed in the head with a knife and died. The body was handed over to her family for burial.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Thieves Who Hid Weapons Arrested One After Another</h3>
<p>Two Others Accused of Hiding Morphine</p>
<p>Remaining Thieves to be Tried Together with the Wang Liutao Case</p>
<p>The Xinzha Police Station arrested a thief named Wang Liutao and sent him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Wang then confessed that a large number of accomplices and weapons were hidden in house number two of Tianxi Lane, Zhengjia Mu Bridge, French Concession. At 12:00 noon the day before yesterday, West Inspector Bao Tai and Chinese Detective Zhao Fuhai, along with Detective Ma Derong, Yang Feizhang, and Weng Peiyu, went with detectives from the French Concession police station. They arrested Wang Zisheng, Wang Wenxiang, Lu Maoda, Zhang Kunjin, Zhou Tangshi, Tang Zhaoshi, Ding Fubao, Ding Liushi, and eight others in succession. They confessed that the guns were in Ding's house. Chinese and Western detectives searched Ding Fubao's house at number three, Huacheng Fang, Mintini Road, but found no weapons, only a large quantity of morphine pills. Ding then confessed that they were secretly hidden under the floor at the doorway of the house. The floor was pried open and four handguns, twenty-nine bullets, and four magazines were found. While the search was in progress, the telephone rang suddenly. The Chinese and Western detectives answered and learned that A Mao from room 302 of the Zhongnan Hotel was calling, inviting Ding to go there to discuss something. The detectives pretended to agree, told him to wait a moment, and that they would come soon. Ding Fubao and Ding Liushi were suspected of hiding morphine, so the French Concession police took them back to prepare for prosecution. The other six people, Wang Zisheng, etc., were taken back to the police station. They then rushed to room 302 of the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, where they arrested Zhang Bingsheng, Weng Yixing, Fei Wenlin, Zhang Er, Gao Fugen, Cheng Derun, Zhao Xuechu, Tan Wenbing, Qin Jiangshi, and nine others. When asked who A Mao was, no one admitted it, so they were all taken to the police station and detained temporarily. Yesterday morning, fifteen people, including Wang Zisheng, were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the defendants in this case were confessed by the already arrested Wang Liutao. Seventeen people were arrested one after another yesterday. However, Ding Fubao and Ding Liushi were not included in the case because the French Concession police station had filed a lawsuit against them in the Second Special District Court today for hiding morphine. The other fifteen people were not prosecuted because the police station did not have time to investigate. He requested permission to detain them until the 22nd and try them together with Wang Liutao. The bullets were presented to the court, and West Inspector Bao Tai reported the circumstances of the case. When questioned, Weng and Cheng hired lawyers Yan Zhendong and Li Shoufa to the court, requesting permission to post bail first. Judge Ge Shixun reviewed the report and ordered that the defendants be detained until the 22nd and tried together.</p>
<h3>A Traveler Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Claims to be Named Tan Hanjing</p>
<p>Leaves a Suicide Note on the Table</p>
<p>At the Qinghe Hotel in Qinghe Fang, Zhejiang Road, Public Concession, at around 6:10 PM the day before yesterday, a young local man, claiming to be named Tan Hanjing, booked room number 225 upstairs. He then handed over six cloth packages he brought with him to the hotel cashier for safekeeping. The waiter immediately asked him for the room fee of one yuan (the room fee for that room is eight jiao per day). The man said that he had many packages stored in the cashier's office, and that they should not worry, and he would pay tomorrow. The waiter repeatedly asked for the money, but he never paid it. Later, at around 11:00 PM, the man closed the door and went to sleep. At around 12:00 noon yesterday, the waiter knocked on the door to wake him up because it was lunchtime, but there was no sound. He felt alarmed and pried open the door, where he saw the man lying stiffly in bed, bleeding from all seven orifices, his face covered in blood, a tragic sight. He was already dead. He immediately reported it to the cashier. Upon investigation, a suicide note was found on the table, stating that he was 21 years old and committed suicide by taking medicine because he was heavily in debt and could not repay it. It was clear that he had died of poisoning. The man was wearing a dark grey serge robe and had a square, fat face. The hotel sent someone to report it to the police.</p>
<h3>Fifteen-Year-Old Boy's Disgusting Behavior</h3>
<p>Parents Should Be Held Responsible</p>
<p>Yu Zhoushi, a woman living at number nine, Mingyuan Fang, Huade Road, works as a female worker in a yarn factory. She leaves early and returns late. Her husband, Yu Jun, and her seven-year-old daughter, Lin Mei, take care of the house. At around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Yu Jun went out, leaving only Lin Mei at home. Gu Dekang, a bad boy from number 768 on the same road, who is fifteen years old, used to live in the same house. He tricked her into the bedroom, pressed her onto the bed, stripped off her underwear, and injured her lower body with his middle finger. The girl cried out in pain. Gu gave her a copper coin, told her to buy candy, and told her not to tell her parents. He then escaped. Later, the girl's mother, Yu Zhoushi, returned home, but Lin Mei did not dare to say anything. It wasn't until 8:30 PM that the girl cried out in pain when she urinated. Yu examined her private parts and found them red and swollen. She questioned her and learned the truth. She went to Gu's house to negotiate with his parents, but to no avail. She took her daughter to the Fu'an Hospital on Nanjing Road to be examined, but because she did not have a certificate, she was sent to the Renji Hospital. The doctor examined Lin Mei and found that the labia of her lower body were injured and contained pus and blood. It would take several weeks to heal. She negotiated with the boy's father, Gu Yushun, who claimed that he was willing to sever the relationship between father and son. Yu asked Gu to pay 40 yuan for medical expenses to avoid further entanglement, but Gu still refused and told Yu to sue. Yu reported the incident to the police station, who ordered detectives to arrest Gu. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Judge Fu Lin opened the court for interrogation. Police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the situation and presented the examination report. Yu Zhoushi then brought her daughter Lin Mei to court to testify to the facts. When questioned, the defendant Yuan Dekang stammered and hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to defend him. The court asked the plaintiff what if the defendant's family paid the medical expenses. Yu replied that if she received compensation for medical expenses, she would not pursue the matter further. Lawyer Yuan stated that the defendant's father, Gu Yushun, was in court and requested to be questioned. Gu then stated that he could comply with the order to pay the medical expenses. Judge Fu announced that he would be lenient considering the boy's youth and ignorance, but that committing such a dirty and despicable act was punishable by up to five years in prison according to the law. Now that the plaintiff had withdrawn the lawsuit, the boy would be returned to his custody and must not commit indecent acts again in the future. Gu Yushun immediately paid the 40 yuan for medical expenses to the court, which was then given to Yu Zhoushi. After Judge Fu thoroughly reprimanded Gu, he ordered that the case not be accepted.</p>
<h3>Chongming Boat Encounters Danger Due to Wind</h3>
<p>People and Goods Lost to Water</p>
<p>Six Boat Partners Still Missing</p>
<p>The Chongming boat Wu Yitai, which had been carrying 400 packages of floral cloth and sand cloth and other goods from the Shanghai Yueji merchant in the Chonghai area, encountered a strong wind and waves while sailing off the coast of Haimen the day before yesterday. The boat's draft was very heavy. The helmsman, seeing the situation, was about to steer towards the shore to take shelter from the wind, when a gust of wind and waves came and was unable to support the boat, causing it to capsize. The boat owner, Wu, and more than a dozen partners, seeing that the boat was in danger, grabbed onto the awning and floated with the wind and waves on the awning, or held onto the floral cloth packages and floated on the sea surface calling for help. The wind and waves were too strong and there were no boats to rescue them. Later, when the wind and waves subsided, two pig boats passed by and rescued the boat owner, Wu, and twelve others. The floral clothes in the boat were floating on the sea surface. Wu hired a boat to salvage the goods and sent people to Chongming to hire a steamer to tow the boat. Yesterday, the boat owner, Wu, arrived in Shanghai on the Baohe boat and reported to Yueji that the boat had capsized due to the wind. Although it had not sunk, the hull was overturned and the floral clothes were all washed away. He has hired a boat and is paying five yuan per package to salvage the goods. Only about a hundred packages have been salvaged so far. It has been checked that six of the boat partners are still missing. The losses are estimated to be huge.</p>

Unexpectedly, three thieves suddenly came along the way. One was wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, one was wearing a black cloth short shirt and pants, and one was wearing a black raincoat. They blocked the way, displayed a handgun, and threatened him not to make a sound. They snatched the 1,000 yuan in cash that Xia was carrying in a paper package, and escaped with the stolen money. Afterwards, Xia reported it to the manager of the store, Gao, who then reported the situation to the district's first police station and requested a pursuit.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, it is reported that the family members of Huang Zicheng claim that they have recently read in the local news column of your newspaper on October 19 that the Chen Tugeng case involved Huang Zicheng, an inspector of the Public Security Bureau, and that he has fled. After reading it, I was extremely surprised. The case in which Ling Jiannan was killed by Wang Wencai and others has nothing to do with Huang Zicheng. This time, Huang Zicheng was ordered by the director on the 14th of this month to go to Hankou on official business, and there is a record to check. How can there be a fact of escape? The published sections are obviously inaccurate. Please correct them in accordance with the regulations. Sincerely, Mr. Editor-in-chief of Shen Bao, Lawyer Xu Heling, October 20th</p>

<p>The Words of Old Man Ma Xiangbo at Ninety-Three</p>
<h3>People Have Eight Emotions Such As Love and Hate</h3>
<p>— Jing Ji —</p>
<p>Elder Xiang once analyzed human emotions:</p>
<p>Love—Desire—Joy—Pleasure</p>
<p>Hate—Fear—Resentment—Sorrow (Chart)</p>
<p>"Explanation"</p>
<p>First, the "hate" side.</p>
<p>First step, people feel "disgusted", and then they will "fear": For example: In the past, villagers hated foreigners, and they used them to scare children—but for people and events that they fear, if they can't escape; then they "complain", and the result of complaining is only "sadness"—</p>
<p>Next, the "love" side.</p>
<p>If there is "love", there will be "desire" immediately. Religious saying. Jesus Christ loves mankind and wants to save the world, and he does not hesitate to suffer all kinds of hardships! This is the best sermon about the correlation between "love" and "desire"! If the desire achieves its purpose, then there will naturally be "joy" without limit. Joy means there is "pleasure".</p>
<p>Let's use current events to prove the psychological theory of the "eight emotions" of Elder Xiang.</p>
<p>The Shanghai people heard the gunfire in Zhabei. Everyone's psychology was disgusted, and they were even a little afraid that the ruthless bullets would fly onto their heads. Naturally, they complained that our country was too weak and suffered unreasonable aggression from Japan! At the end of the Songhu Defense War, a very sad memorial service was held for the fallen national heroes!</p>
<p>The Japanese took a fancy to the three eastern provinces and wanted to take them for themselves. Sure enough, because the national army did not resist at all, they got it in a few days! They were extremely happy, and a year later they had to hold an anniversary of the military and civilians enjoying themselves!</p>
<h3>Zhu Zhu</h3>
<p>— Held · Buddha ·</p>
<p>—Better to be the Mouth of a Chicken than the Behind of an Ox—</p>
<p>Everyone knows that in the Song Dynasty, there were two Masters Cheng, who were famous scholars of Neo-Confucianism. Zhu Kao-ting (Xi) studied their knowledge and became a great Confucian. Who knew that now there are two Mr. Zhu, who are men of courage, going north alone, one after the other, to participate in actual battles. As a result, the Northeast Volunteer Army has gained great momentum, and the Japanese army is dealing with them on all sides, exhausted. Who are these two Mr. Zhu? One is General Zhu Qinglan, and the other is Mr. Zhu Jiqing. I call them the "Two Masters Zhu" of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>"Ooh," "ooh" is the crowing of a chicken, and "zhu," "zhu" is the call of a chicken. According to popular custom: the chicken was transformed from Zhu Weng, so calling a chicken is "zhu zhu." This is a myth, and there is no need to pay attention to it. I used to read the Poetry Collection from the曝書亭 by Zhu Zhuyu, and saw the words "zhu zhu" used to describe the sound of a chicken crowing many times, so I got the following feeling.</p>
<p>Isn't it said in the Strategies of the Warring States? "A humble saying goes: 'Better to be the mouth of a chicken than the behind of an ox.'" Sima Qian also has the saying "mouth of a chicken, behind of an ox." The ancients explained: "Although the mouth of a chicken is small, it still eats; although the behind of an ox is large, it only excretes." I think: The mouths of the big shots and gentlemen are full of calls for resistance against Japan, prolonged resistance, sounding like thunder; even Zhong Jun volunteering to go north to kill the enemy, they talk as if it were a real thing. In fact, their mouths are hard but their bones are soft, moving as slowly as an ox, not moving at all, willing to open their big mouths to fart and excrete, how could they be willing to follow the two Masters Zhu to Jilin to kill the enemy! Alas! I hope that we as citizens, would rather be the mouth of a chicken than the behind of an ox!"</p>
<h3>Two Kinds of Attitudes</h3>
<p>— Qian ·</p>
<p>These are two sentences a friend told me. I find them very interesting, and now I write them down:</p>
<p>Before a person becomes an official, their attitude is easily "radicalized"; after becoming an official, their attitude is easily "corrupted." If you don't believe it, you can take a look in Shanghai, and then take a look in Nanjing. Why are there these two kinds of attitudes? I can't say!</p>
<p>Before a person gets married, they desperately flatter the other party, like the lowest kind of slave; after getting married, huh, they lift their chins, and if the woman doesn't flatter them, they will take a concubine! Why are there these two kinds of attitudes? I can't say either!</p>
<h3>Luxury with Conditions</h3>
<p>— Tao · Zai · Dong ·</p>
<p>—Can Be Called National Luxury or Luxury to Save the Country—</p>
<p>Since wealthy people generally engage in extravagant and excessive desires, triggering a backlash, it is natural to raise the idea of rejecting luxury and advocating frugality, but those who speak speak, and those who are extravagant are extravagant, which is useless. It is better to lower the standard a little and discuss it from the perspective of luxury, attaching a condition. What is the condition? That is national luxury. What is national luxury? That is, exclusively using domestic goods and excluding Europeanization.</p>
<p>Because most of the money is wantonly squandered and wasted, this is called luxury. On one hand, excessive enjoyment is felt to be unfair, while on the other hand, finance is circulated, and industry, commerce, and ordinary people benefit from it. Therefore, luxury cannot be condemned as absolute evil. If the idea of advocating frugality is believed, then the rich will hoard their wealth for their own enjoyment, like Dong Zhuo's Mei Wu, Gongsun Zan's Jinglou, or even like King Yan Liu Rengong using iron money, collecting gold and silver money to put into mountain cellars, what would society rely on?</p>
<p>There is a saying that satirizes luxury: "A rich man's one night of wine is a poor man's half-year of food." Those who hear it are angry and sigh, but this is just comparing it to one poor man. In fact, the cost of this one night of wine benefits more than just one poor man. The more it is squandered, the more it benefits. Why? Because it circulates finance.</p>
<p>What is hated about today's luxury is its Europeanization. Imported goods have hundreds of harms and not a single benefit, and should be corrected. One should exclusively use domestic goods. Clothing can be silk and satin, why must it be wool? Wine can be Huadiao, why must it be champagne? Even opium can be domestic, why must it be Bo Yin? Other things can be inferred by analogy. The main purpose is to prevent the outflow of economic rights, which is just a change in the psychology of the extravagant.</p>
<p>Judging from luxury itself, Europeanized luxury is imitation and affectation, which is not what people are accustomed to. How can it be comfortable? Speaking of comfort, in terms of daily life, clothing, food, and entertainment, what is better than China? For thousands of years, things have been improved and embellished, and prosperity and abundance have increased. There is no need to go far to the Sui Yang Emperor and Song Huizong. Just look at the luxury of the Qing Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, and even the era of Empress Dowager Cixi. Gentlemen, try to study its methods and follow them, develop and expand them, and it can create a kind of national luxury, which is not only a means of regulating domestic finance and equalizing wealth. Taking the example of sparrows flying west, it will make Paris learn to walk and New York imitate. If they are assimilated into our national luxury, then you gentlemen can indulge in extravagance, and it can be said that luxury saves the country. What about advocating frugality?</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Lin Sen</h3>
<p>— Qiu · Lang ·</p>
<p>—Mocked by Guards—</p>
<p>Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, is a senior and respected figure. He is an amiable elder statesman of the Party and the country. Although there are criticisms that he is a chairman who only affixes seals or persuades people (to retain ministers), in this time of national crisis, the position of chairman is certainly not easy to hold! Moreover, he travels around for all parties and falls ill from overwork. He came to Shanghai for medical treatment, and recently there were rumors that he returned to Fujian to revise the genealogy. He is indeed a noble person with many noble affairs. Now I will describe an anecdote about him. Before he was honorably appointed chairman, one day he went to visit Chiang Kai-shek in person because of important official business. Who knew that when he arrived at the entrance of the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters, he was stopped by the guards. Although he explained to the soldiers that he was Lin Mou, the guards did not believe him because they saw that his clothes were very simple and thought he was not an important person. He was so helpless that he even had a dispute with the guards! At that time, Chiang happened to come out from inside, saw that it was him, and hurriedly said, "Please come in." These guards were all confused and had to salute with their guns. Alas! In today's society, it is inherently snobbish. "Only valuing clothes and not valuing people" is truly lamentable!</p>
<h3>A Room in the Attic</h3>
<p>— · Lu · Ding ·</p>
<p>—Random Thoughts—</p>
<p>Of course, this is only because my family is poor and I am incompetent. If my family were rich, I would definitely not live in an attic room. If I were capable, I would definitely not live in an attic room. Conversely, if there were no attic rooms, there would definitely be no humble me in Shanghai.</p>
<p>"Just enough to fit the knees," unable to stretch the head, "sharing a bed and talking about the wind and rain," hearing fights next door, these two sentences may or may not be believed to be true, but when it comes to attic rooms, it is indeed an accurate description—even if you think a step back, in a humble alley, there was Yan Hui, and beside a broken bed, there was Yuan Xian. Being content with poverty and finding joy in the Way is certainly not to be blamed. What harm is there in shaking your head and massaging the floorboards, or turning around and making the furniture dance? The whispers of the friendly neighbors, the cries of the children, are not necessarily the music in your dreams. Sometimes, although the door is there, it is often open, and a gentle breeze blows in. Sometimes, although there is a window, it cannot be blocked, and fine rain comes in, then it is perfect, and it is all good.</p>
<p>Even if that's not the case, your honorable feet may pass through the kitchen, and your noble hands may reach the living room, so you must be very careful, lest you walk to the neighbor's house in your dreams and become an uninvited guest!</p>
<p>Although it is certainly impossible in reason and difficult to have in reality, in an attic room, it can be said, done, and accomplished.</p>
<p>Attic rooms and residents come in different kinds. There are attic room writers, attic room wanderers, and even attic room sisters-in-law. I am also a distinguished guest of an attic room!</p>

Now, in order to reward the ladies of the country, a large number of famous and expensive soaps will be bundled into sets, each set containing more than twenty pieces, sold for only one yuan. It can be said to be extremely cheap. The Wu Zhou Pharmacy Head Office in this city and all its branches are holding this event simultaneously. Hong</p>
<h3>Fellow Postal Travelers Entering the Pass (18)</h3>
<p>— Seeking Happiness Studio Owner</p>
<p>Whether the time is hard and bitter or sweet and pleasant, it all passes quickly. In the blink of an eye, it is already the summer of the 21st year of the Republic of China, and the anniversary of the "September 18th Incident" is approaching! The entire Northeast, the lifeless Shenyang, is still under the iron heel of the Japanese soldiers in a state of deep water and scorching fire, with no light in sight, and no hope of recovery by the Republic of China. Perhaps that old, sick man-like China is numb and has lost consciousness, and has forgotten the pain of being severed by force by a strong man, and is willing to abandon it?</p>
<p>The numbness itself may not feel any pain? It is only that part that is forcibly dragged onto the chopping board by a strong man and skinned alive bit by bit is certainly not feeling well. And those 30 million innocent and pitiful people who have been abandoned on it will live the life of prisoners, unable to live or die, like poor children without parents, especially miserable and unparalleled, beyond the imagination of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Therefore, Lu Boqin is fortunate to still have his lover to comfort him, and whenever he looks at the difficulties of the times and remembers the national humiliation, he cannot help but have an unnamed feeling of loneliness and indignation, which will suddenly erupt when he is talking sweet words with his lover, wanting to vent his feelings by singing wildly and crying loudly like smashing a pot, but the place where he speaks is mostly at the Tong's house, and Tong Yizhen's uncle can always hear it. At first, he only quietly advised him with a pale face to remember to protect himself wisely, to speak less and avoid trouble, and not to forget that there are ears on the walls and that it is easy to implicate others. But later, when the Japanese-made "Manchukuo" appeared, this great-uncle suddenly changed to a strong attitude and dared to rebuke Lu Boqin's words cursing Japan as disrespectful to his face. Once, he even confessed that he was a citizen of Manchukuo and could not tolerate a reactionary openly slandering Manchukuo in his house. If it were not for the sake of their past friendship, he would definitely report him to the Japanese military police to give him a taste of the consequences. Otherwise, please go somewhere else to express such mad and rebellious opinions. The lightest punishment here is to issue an eviction order and offer a bowl of cold shoulder. It seems that the people of Manchukuo can stick out their bellies and act tough, and no longer cherish the small favor of Lu Boqin's subsidies for household expenses from foreigners within the Pass.</p>

<h3>Little Change in Financial Bullion</h3>
<p>A slight increase of one or two taels. Yesterday the bullion price slightly changed, initially weak but then strong, but there was no major turmoil. The daily difference was four taels and seven qian, totaling a further increase of more than one tael. Trading in the market was still agile and the will of the industry was firm. The overseas money market remained the same, with British up and American flat, similar to yesterday's market conditions, but the exchange rate continued to fall and the American flower (dollar) increased significantly. Therefore, the gold price initially fell, then fluctuated by more than one or two taels, once returning to the 700 taels mark. Because foreign exchange was long, sellers increased again, and the market trend was mostly bullish. The bulls took the lead, and finally it was outside of 34 taels, and the spot was opened by the Central Bank by 210 bars, sold by Taikang, Runrun Changyu, etc. All of the November futures were sold by the bulls Hengxing to Tongtaichang and Kaitai, etc., for 300 bars, with a premium of 5 taels to 5 taels and 5 qian.

<p>Bullish momentum in the afternoon. The afternoon market opened weakly, at 30 taels and 0.05 qian. It is rumored that the United States plans to issue 500 million gold notes to help industry and commerce, so people's hearts were frustrated, and then they looked up, because the American dollar was 5.625 in January, and Huabi Huixing Citibank absorbed it, and Huayin Bank sold it. Yixing Yongheng Yu Zhifeng Yong Zhaofeng Chang and others aggressively bought in, and the Central Bank opened 105 cash bars, reaching 33 taels and 3 qian at 3:30.

<h3>Booming Stock and Bond Prices</h3>
<p>—Demand is Relatively Strong, Prices Recover by Thirty to Forty Cents—</p>
<p>—Total Turnover Reaches Over Four Million Nine Hundred Thousand Yuan—</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the bond market was booming. Except for the '96 Finance' futures, all other current and next-month futures opened. The market was quite active. Demand was strong from all sides, and trading volume far exceeded the previous day. Morning trading totaled over 2.7 million yuan, with the afternoon market adding over 2.1 million yuan, bringing the total to 4.92 million yuan. Of this, salt tax bonds accounted for 1,275,000 yuan, consolidated tax bonds 845,000 yuan, and '20 Customs', troop disbandment bonds each about 600,000 yuan. The remaining 2-300,000 yuan were from other bonds. However, the 'Entire 6 Customs' 96 bonds remained sluggish, and financial bonds continued to have no market. The spot market continued to decline, with only 13,000 yuan traded throughout the day. As for the trend of various bonds, the domestic situation was slightly more optimistic than before, and with the end of the month approaching, swap trading increased. Scattered investments and short-covering by various parties were quite active, leading to demand exceeding supply and a consistent rise compared to the previous day. However, since major players did not engage in significant transactions, the trend remained generally stable. As a result, 'Customs 20', 'Customs' spot bonds each rose by nearly one yuan, 'Consolidated Tax' spot and troop disbandment bonds both spot and futures rose by nearly half a yuan. Other bonds continued to improve by about twenty to thirty cents. The trend was generally consistent.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Turns Strong</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: On Wednesday (the 19th), the New York stock market initially showed weakness, fluctuating for some time. Later, rumors circulated in the market that the automobile magnate Ford planned to purchase 75,000,000 bushels of wheat at a price of six corners per bushel, and resell it to China with a seven-year credit arrangement. Various commodities immediately rebounded, and stocks also rose accordingly. As a result, prices rose slightly more than the previous day, with Case agricultural implements up four dollars, American Telephone and Telegraph, and New York Consolidated Gas up two and a half dollars, and Union Pacific Railroad, and Union Carbide up three dollars. The total trading volume for the day was 1.3 million shares. Furthermore, according to Iron Age magazine estimates, steel production this week was 19.5%, a 0.5% increase from last week. It is unlikely that there will be any changes before the presidential election. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Markets Gradually Showing Upward Trend</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is firming up and gradually showing an upward trend. This is because the bullish Rongxing group is holding firm, only closing out this month's sales and rolling them into forward positions. They are unwilling to loosen their grip on their long positions. At the same time, spot demand in the market has slightly increased, and raw cotton prices have risen, leading to the rise in the yarn market.</p>
<p>Manbiao Trends Towards Progress: The Manbiao market opened with a slight rise in American cotton. Sellers were scarce in the market, and prices rose by three to four qian. The afternoon market was even stronger, with each month rising by one to four qian. The total trading volume for the day was 16,200 bales. According to inquiries, 600 bales were sold by Mingde, 400 bales by Daji, 400 bales by Jifeng, 650 bales by Changyu, and 550 bales by Yicheng. Buyers included 600 bales by Huai Dachengchang, 800 bales by Changfeng, 600 bales by Yukang, and 350 bales by Renfeng. The Manbiao closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Shantou 85, Xiamen 20, Sichuan 650, Fellow Traders 50, Jiangxi 3</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Extremely Buoyant, Trending Higher</h3>
<p>The cotton market is firm due to a slight rise in American cotton. According to private sources, there are reports of price increases in Hankou. With the October delivery period approaching, a certain manufacturer is dumping a large amount and is preparing to purchase spot goods for delivery. According to inquiries, the number of those with optimistic views has increased again, with estimates exceeding 10,000 dan. However, open interest still stands at over 100,000 dan, although about half of this is inter-firm open interest. Nevertheless, Yong'an Factory and most bullish speculators are holding firm, causing the market to suddenly turn tight.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Rises by as Much as 4.5 Qian This Month: The Zheng Biao market opened with a rise in American cotton. Sellers were scarce in the market, and prices rose by two qian for each month. In the afternoon, due to issues regarding October deliveries, the market tightened further, with each month rising by another 1.5 to 2 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 51,900 dan. According to inquiries, 2,700 dan were sold by Jifeng, 2,800 dan by Yuanda, 3,700 dan by Gengfeng, 2,100 dan by Mingde, and 1,300 dan by Taixing. Buyers included 2,900 dan by Changfeng, 1,900 dan by Mingde, 1,800 dan by Changhe, 1,000 dan by Delong, and 1,100 dan by Yichang. The Zheng Biao closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Holders of Raw Cotton Adopt a Tougher Stance: Although spot cotton demand is not strong, the rise in futures has caused holders of goods to adopt a tougher stance and selling prices have become firmer. Incoming cotton included 3,474 bales of Yao flower and 600 bales of Tongzhou flower. Sales offers are as follows:</p>
<p>Tongzhou Flower, 31.91, Su Lundai, 2,500 bales, Spot goods delivered to Suzhou</p>
<p>Xia Sha Flower, 31.80, Tongyi Jin, 200 bales, Spot goods delivered to factory</p>
<h3>American Cotton Finally Good at 14 Pounds Sterling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to positive news from Liverpool, then weakened due to selling from the South, and finally rose again due to strong support on Wall Street. Futures rose 9 to 15 points, and spot prices rose 10 points. English cotton futures rose 3 to 4 points, and spot prices rose 18 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 20 points. The Indian cotton market was firm, with Pinkole down 1.25 rupees, Omlah down 2.75 rupees, and Bai Luoqi down 6.25 rupees. The original telegraph record is on the left (telegram of the 19th):</p>

<h3>Food and Rice Prices Fall by Fifty to Sixty Cents</h3>
<p>Hu Nan: Yesterday, the ships from the West Road source detained at Nanhang Port were not cleared, and trading in this street was sluggish. Kiln-grown Baige, Yeda, and other varieties of rice fell sharply by fifty to sixty cents. Xixin and Chenpo also fell by twenty to thirty cents. Yangdujian showed no change. The total volume traded in the Huangpu River was about 500 dan.</p>
<p>Xin Zha: The roads for sailing ships have been opened. Due to the new crop, the appetite of urban and rural shops is extremely weak. Xin Jing, broken rice, Gong kiln-grown, all fell by four corners. However, white rice is scarce and liked by rural customers, so the situation continued to be firm. New and old Yangdujian and Bujjian were affected by foreign rice, and the price fell by two corners. It is reported that about 200 boatmen in the Yejiadun area can resolve the issues within the next two days. The market outlook is slightly lower.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Suddenly Experiences a Huge Drop in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>—Deferred Contracts Drop into the Eighty-Cash Range—</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for each month showed a slight firmness. Because the quoted price for foreign wheat was slightly better by one to two jiao, those outside the industry were slightly firmer, about five li better than the closing price of the previous day. However, trading was minimal and remained quiet. In the afternoon, a huge drop in deferred contracts occurred again because Australian wheat was being offered at a lower price. It was rumored that the price of white wheat was set at only three liang and two fen. Large and small factories were setting prices to open, so from December onwards, Xin, Fufeng, Xinda, Yifeng, and Xiangxin factories all dumped their holdings, especially for contracts from January onwards, which led to a gradual decline in the market. The prices for December, January, February, and March all dropped into the eighty-cash range. This price, in terms of the trend of foreign wheat, cannot be sustained. It would not be surprising if it dropped to one liang and seven qian and a half. The current price for this month and spot goods from the factories is still ninety qian, so they are holding up. However, this is just a forced effort. As a result, the price for this month was slightly better by five li, November fell by one fen and seven li half, and December to March each fell by two fen and two li half.</p>
<h3>Forward Wheat Stabilizes Due to Short Covering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the forward wheat market was generally stable. The quoted price for foreign wheat recovered by one or two jiao, so sentiment was firm, about two to three fen better than the closing price of the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, this month's contracts showed slight weakness. Forward contracts were stable because No. 43 was eager to cover their shorts. However, trading was quiet and there were few buyers. Given the current low price of spot foreign wheat, it is feared that the price of Manbiao wheat will still not be stable. As a result, this month's contracts were unchanged, November was better by two fen, January was better by three fen, and February and March were better by two fen. The spot wheat market was still calm. 500 bags of Kai Yaowan wheat were opened at a price of three liang and four qian, and were handled by Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Over a Thousand Bags of Huizhou White Sugar Offered</h3>
<p>—Dutch Red Sugar Market Turns Tight—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association's prices for 24 Coarse Granulated White sugar and Medium Granulated White sugar remained unchanged, with little fluctuation. On the foreign firm side, Jardine Matheson offered 150 tons of 24 Coarse Granulated White sugar for shipment in November at a price of four yuan and sixty-three cents in Dutch currency. This was still considered reasonable, and the market was quite buoyant. Due to the Hao Fang's defense and plans to raise prices to buy in, the Dutch Red Sugar market suddenly turned tight. No. 8 was marked at ten liang and eight qian, and Nos. 9 and 10 were at eleven liang and two to three qian. Yesterday, Geng Family offered over a thousand bags of Huizhou white sugar at a price of fourteen liang and three to four qian. The Jian trading house offered over a hundred boxes of Wang Yibai rock sugar at a price of ten liang and three qian per zhu, and dozens of boxes of Tongshou ice at nine liang and eight qian.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Autumn Cocoons from Wuxi Are Continuously Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>—Total Reaches Over One Thousand Dan—</p>
<p>The autumn cocoons cultivated by farmers in the cities and villages of Wuxi are mostly of improved varieties. Although the cocoon production is not abundant, the quality of the cocoons is excellent. Shanghai silk merchants are actively going to Wuxi to purchase autumn cocoons. After the cocoon market closes, the collected dry cocoons are now being transported to Shanghai continuously by both land and water routes. In the past half month, over 1,300 dan of new autumn cocoons from Wuxi have been shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Goods: Lily Flower Number Plates are Firmly Guarded</h3>
<p>—Fewer Goods After Quanhua Yuan—</p>
<p>Not many lily flowers have arrived recently. According to inquiries, each trading house has about a thousand bags of previously arrived goods in stock. Traders once contacted the producing areas through the trading houses and offered thirteen liang and a half to thirteen liang. Yesterday, the replies from the producing areas indicated that they were unwilling to sell. Therefore, the goods from each trading house have been transferred to warehouses to be guarded uniformly, so the market is slightly tight. However, there are still many goods in stock, so it is feared that the price will not rise too high in the short term.</p>
<p>Quanzhou Big Bubble Longan: High-quality goods in the current market are still popular, but the middle and lower grades are extremely weak, so the opening prices have turned downwards. However, according to yesterday's telegram from the producing area, the incoming goods on subsequent ships have been greatly reduced. It is heard that there are only about 600 pieces being shipped to Shanghai. The market should be stable.</p>

<p>Supplement to the Shanghai Shen Bao</p>
<p>Speech</p>
<h3>A German "Old Red"</h3>
<p>— Fo.</p>
<p>The term "old red" can often be heard in Shanghai's lower-class society. I have no way of investigating the meaning and origin of the term "old red," but in short, it is probably an ominous term. However, Germany now has an "old red," and it is a very well-behaved female "old red."</p>
<p>According to a Berlin dispatch on the 18th, when the German Parliament reconvenes, there will be two elderly members vying for the position of Speaker: one is General Litzmann, aged 82, and the other is Ms. Sittkin, aged 75, a prominent Communist Party member, who is called the "Old Red of Parliament." These two elderly people are truly what Mencius called "great elders of the world." However, while it is appropriate for Germans to call her "Red Mother," people in other countries cannot call her that; they can only call her "Old Red," because she is an elderly woman who believes in Communism. This kind of "Old Red" cannot be found not only in the lower-class society of our country, but also in the upper-class society. It is truly an "Old Red."</p>
<p>One of the contenders for the position of Speaker of the German Parliament is a general, and the other is an "Old Red." The general is 82 years old, and the "Old Red" is 75 years old. Both are over seventy years old. At such an advanced age in our country, they would surely be senile and have lost all interest. However, these two elderly people in Germany still have great enthusiasm and are competing for the position of Speaker. From this, we can see the strength of the German people's physique and the spirit that does not diminish with age, which is why their country is so strong. Therefore, while "Old Red" is the same term, our country despises it, while foreign countries respect it. It all depends on the ability of the "Old Red."</p>
<p>Chen Duxiu is also an advocate of Communism. He was recently arrested and sent to Beijing for trial. However, Chen is only 54 years old, not yet sixty, but his hair is already gray, his spirit is flagging, and he looks old. Therefore, while he is "red," he is not "old."</p>

<h3>Lamenting the Ravages of Autumn's End, I Impulsively Compose This</h3>

<p>Why does autumn always bring so much sorrow?</p>
<p>Black waters and white mountains frequently enter my dreams,</p>
<p>The fires of Lu Rong are painful to bear.</p>
<p>It's hard to get drunk on Mount Tianheng,</p>

<p>The desolate frontier is filled with smoke.</p>
<p>This trouble originated in Yinghuan,</p>
<p>And holds an irreconcilable grudge that cannot be filled.</p>
<p>It's sad to see the division between Han and Hu,</p>
<p>And it's painful to see the old general die in Youyan.</p>
<p>White waters and black mountains all change color,</p>
<p>And the red blood turns into warp threads over the years.</p>

<h3>Several Methods for Making Cosmetics</h3>
<p>— Gu. Xue. Qiu.</p>
<p>There are many types of cosmetics sold on the market. Among them, there are indeed many good ones, but there are also many inferior goods that flood the market. Furthermore, many expensive products rely on foreign countries, and the outflow of money each year is countless. There are also some unscrupulous merchants who specialize in selling inferior goods to deceive people and make money. Users not only do not benefit from them, but also suffer a lot of harm. However, making your own is not difficult. It does not require profound chemical knowledge, nor does it require rich experience. Moreover, self-made products are cheap and of good quality. Not only are you not deceived, but the value is much cheaper than those sold on the market! Now, I will introduce several methods that I have learned from experimentation:</p>
<p>Method for Making Cold Cream:</p>
<p>Ingredients: High-quality White Vaseline Oil, Sixty Grams</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>White Wax, Fifteen Grams</p>
<p>Rose Water, Twenty-Four Grams</p>
<p>Borax, One Gram</p>
<p>Rose Oil, Appropriate Amount (Several Drops)</p>
<p>Method: First, slowly dissolve the white wax in vaseline oil, at a temperature of about 60 degrees Celsius. It should not be too high. At the same time, dissolve the borax in rose water and heat it to a temperature equal to that of the petroleum borax oil, about 60 degrees Celsius. Then, slowly add the solution of borax and rose water to the vaseline oil, stirring constantly with a stick to make it uniform. When it becomes a white, fatty substance, wait for it to cool slightly, then add the rose oil. Because adding the fragrance when it is hot will often easily cause the fragrance to dissipate, so you must pay attention to this. After adding the fragrance, seal it in a wide-mouthed bottle to obtain the product.</p>
<p>Method for Making a Cold Cream Stick:</p>
<p>Ingredients: Paraffin Wax, Ten Grams</p>
<p>Wax Oil, Ten Grams</p>
<p>Vaseline, Five Grams</p>
<p>Candle Rouge Powder, Appropriate Amount</p>
<p>Rose Oil, Several Drops</p>
<p>Method: First, mix the paraffin wax and wax oil in a pot, heat and wait for them to melt, then add vaseline, stirring constantly. Then, add an appropriate amount of candle rouge powder to make the color pink, which is more beautiful. If you want green, you can add an appropriate amount of candle green powder. When it cools down, add the fragrance to complete the process.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the ratio of the above ingredients, you can increase or decrease the wax oil or paraffin wax at will to make it moderately soft and hard. The consistency of the paste is determined by the amount of vaseline.</p>
<p>Method for Making Hair Wash:</p>
<p>Ingredients: Rose Water, Two Hundred and Fifty Parts</p>
<p>Transparent Soap, Forty Parts</p>
<p>Alcohol, Fifty Parts</p>
<p>Saffron, Five Parts</p>
<p>Method: First, add the transparent soap and saffron to an appropriate amount of distilled water, boil and dissolve them. Then, add rose water and alcohol. After standing for several days, take it out and filter it. The filtrate obtained below can be applied.</p>
<p>The above three methods are simple to perform, and the ingredients are cheap. Readers may wish to try them. As for the purchase of ingredients, you can purchase them from Western pharmacies or the China Scientific Instrument Museum.</p>

<h3>Proposal to Eliminate the Bad Habits of Smoking and Drinking</h3>
<p>— Xi ··</p>
<p>In China today, where we are experiencing extreme economic difficulties, and where the economy is calling for austerity, I would like to make this small suggestion—the elimination of the bad habits of smoking and drinking.</p>
<p>Smoking and drinking are originally the most common and trivial things for socializing. It doesn't seem worth making such a big fuss about "making a mountain out of a molehill." But you have to think, if you can add up the daily consumption of cigarettes and alcohol, it will definitely surprise and terrify us!</p>
<p>There are too many people who "only consume and do not produce." This is probably one of the reasons why China has become so poor!</p>
<p>In the recent past, during those few days of the Mid-Autumn Festival, I remember that many people advocated not eating mooncakes, and donating the money saved to the Volunteer Army in the Northeast. This is a very valuable and admirable thing, but this is still a rare opportunity once a year. If the good opportunity is missed, one can't help but sigh "What a pity!" Even though the volunteer army is still fighting the Japanese desperately!</p>
<p>The consumption of cigarettes and alcohol is many millions of times greater than that of mooncakes. If we can completely eliminate it, the money saved can be used to donate to the volunteer army and to create a national salvation fund to build airplanes, warships, and armaments. When our military salaries are abundant and our strength is sufficient, we won't have to fear ten such Japanese as we have now, and they will only be in the palm of our hands.</p>
<p>The words may be too far away, but if you can find a way to eliminate these habits, it will not be a small supplement to the country!</p>
<p>Moreover, cigarettes and alcohol are both stimulating and can cause your brain to be overstimulated, which can make you foolish and forgetful. Like opium addicts, it can cause you to lose your family fortune and become weak, and sometimes it can cause you to enter the grave early!</p>
<p>In short, cigarettes and alcohol are harmful and useless things, and it is necessary to eliminate them. As for the method of elimination, such as the government's explicit prohibition or the imposition of heavy taxes, these are all methods. This seat is only a suggestion, and whether it can be passed or not, please discuss it in detail among all members.</p>

<h3>It Turns Out That...</h3>
<p>— Su Sheng</p>
<p>In order to grasp some basic common sense of jurisprudence, I have chosen to study "General Principles of Law" this semester with great care. This is naturally different from courses selected for credit.</p>
<p>Initially, I heard that this year's professor of "General Principles of Law" is a double doctorate, holding both a Doctor of Law and a Doctor of Philosophy, and has served as a law professor in various universities in the country. Judging from his qualifications and experience, there is no doubt about his profound knowledge.</p>
<p>However, things always turn out unexpectedly. After hearing this doctor professor's high-sounding theories, I couldn't help but fall into the abyss of disappointment. It turns out this doctor is like this, which is really beyond our expectations. When he starts lecturing, it's all nonsense, incoherent, and without any clues. When he writes, it's like a crab crawling! Ah! Doctor Professor, so that's what you're like!</p>
<p>Since the professor is like this, the students naturally become casual as well. Therefore, all sorts of trivial and frivolous things occur in the classroom. Reading newspapers, dozing off, reading novels, chatting with each other, making noise! All kinds of things, nothing is too strange. It can be said that listening is absolutely rare. I'm afraid only the walls can sense what this professor is saying.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, the professor must feel very bitter! Since he is lecturing and listening to himself, why bother to suffer and strain himself doing such futile things? On the students' side, they naturally feel extremely bored. Since they gain nothing by sitting in the classroom, why bother to suffer their butts and fight with the benches? Aren't these all foolish actions?</p>
<p>Hmph! Those who say they are fools are fools themselves! You must know that the purpose of current teachers is not necessarily to teach students or impart knowledge. So, it's okay if students don't listen. As long as they hold onto their jobs and receive their salaries, that's all that matters.</p>
<p>Then what about the current students? It's quite strange to say. Who knows that their purpose in coming to school is not to explore knowledge or cultivate morality and character. So, it's okay if the professor teaches poorly, as long as they get the credits after half a year and the diploma after four years. The so-called diploma is their one and only goal.</p>
<p>There is a Chinese saying: "People of the same kind come together." If we use this saying to compare our current university students and university professors, that would be absolutely correct! With this kind of student who is solely for the diploma, there is also this kind of professor who is solely for the money. This is indeed a family.</p>
<p>Family Issues</p>
<h3>A Two-Act Tragedy</h3>
<p>— Xiao Bo</p>
<p>It was approximately an early autumn evening. As usual, our whole family was gathered together eating dinner when suddenly we heard a desperate and feeble cry for help from the Wang family next door. Without a word, we simultaneously put down our rice bowls and ran out the door with great surprise and suspicion. We saw that the Wang family's doorway was already swarming with people, packed like sardines. Mrs. Lu and Granny Li were all gossiping and sneering, naturally standing in the ranks of judges. I started working as the on-site reporter. It turned out that the person who had just screamed was Old Mrs. Wang, who was over sixty years old, very frail, and afraid of being blown over by the wind when she walked. Her husband ran a small fabric store. Over the years, they had lived a frugal and simple life, so they had some savings. Unfortunately, he had passed away early. The only son he left behind, who was eighteen or nineteen years old, also passed away less than two years after his father's death due to lung disease. Alas! You can imagine the shock and grief Old Mrs. Wang suffered from such an earth-shattering misfortune. Therefore, her old age became even more dilapidated.</p>
<p>Later, she decided that since the Wang family would have no descendants from now on, and she lacked someone to serve her and manage her meager assets, it would not do. So, she consulted with her relatives and had them adopt a son for her from elsewhere. This son was already thirteen or fourteen years old. Now, think about how difficult it is to tame such an old son! Moreover, his own family was very wealthy, but because his parents had eight or nine children, he was the most mischievous and spent the most money, so they couldn't wait for them to take him away.</p>
<p>After he entered the Wang family's door, his old habits resurfaced. He spent money lavishly and treated his adoptive mother like a servant. But poor Old Mrs. Wang shed tears in secret, a deaf person eating bitter melon, unable to express her suffering.</p>
<p>After four or five years of this, she even started dreaming of having a grandson. So, she married him a wife. In the beginning, the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was not bad, but later, because the old woman's mind was stubborn, she inevitably became a little nagging. You can imagine that this shrewd and cunning daughter-in-law would not tolerate her. So, she often stirred up trouble in front of her husband, saying how bad the old bones were, how wicked they were. This heartless adopted son actually listened to his wife's words and repeatedly joined her in insulting and scolding Old Mrs. Wang.</p>
<p>On that day, things happened to coincide. Old Mrs. Wang, because she often suffered injustice from the two of them, went to play cards at a neighbor's house to dispel the bitterness in her heart. Who knew that when she returned home in the evening, his and her wolf-like eyes were fiercely fixed on Old Mrs. Wang's face. Her son began to shout sternly, "You old bones, you're really senile! Don't you know that in these difficult times, where is the money for you to waste? And..." Old Mrs. Wang couldn't help but scold back, "You rebellious wretch! You go out every day to hang out with friends, gamble, and drink. Isn't that my money? Why is it illegal for me to seek some pleasure occasionally? What a bastard!" Before she could finish speaking, the son became enraged, raised his iron fist, and struck Old Mrs. Wang's chest with force. The punch and kick immediately knocked the weak Old Mrs. Wang to the ground. Alas, I can't bear to write any further. I can only sigh at the perversion of ethics, the decline of morals, and grieve for the tragedy of our country's old-fashioned families.</p>

<h3>When Is a Woman Most Ashamed?</h3>
<p>— Ant</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to attend the X Society's gathering, and I encountered a very interesting and unique after-party event. Originally, after-party events mostly consisted of singing and dancing, but this time, it was truly unexpected.</p>
<p>First, the chairman roughly divided the members present into several groups, about ten people per group. Then, he presented a topic called "When Is a Woman Most Ashamed?" Each group was to discuss it and come up with something humorous and interesting. After the discussion, each group would send a good speaker to the stage to present their findings. The presentations from each group were then compiled and judged, with the method of judging being whoever evoked the most laughter was crowned the winner. The discussion time was limited to only fifteen minutes. After the allotted time, everyone took to the stage to submit their answers. As a result, it was full of fun and laughter. I have recorded some of the humorous material below for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>The first to speak was a Mr. Zhang. This Mr. Zhang was known for his humor in the X Society. He was always able to seize any opportunity to tell jokes. On this day, there were a pair of engaged couples among those present, and Mr. Zhang took them as his target, saying: "There are many things that women are ashamed of. Instead of relying on ideal abstract talking, it is better to talk about realistically provable things, such as asking Miss Liang to call Miss and Mister Tuo Xu (namely an engaged couple) 'dear brother', I thought Miss Liang would definitely feel very difficult and shy, this time I think is the most ashamed." A burst of applause and laughter followed, and Miss Liang's face really had two red clouds flying onto it, lining her white serge coat, also see her bashfulness, Mr. Zhang won first place. After that, many more people lectured on various stories, and I will only record some of the speeches here:</p>
<p>"When it's hot, and she's only wearing cicada-wing-like clothes, in a large crowd, socializing busily, suddenly spring colors can't be contained and red apricots come out of the wall, at this time, women must be too ashamed to speak."</p>
<p>"Older brother married sister-in-law, after half a year, sister-in-law's belly rose, the mischievous little brother asked sister-in-law in front of her, 'sister-in-law, how did your belly get so big?' The degree of shame for the sister-in-law at this time is indescribable."</p>
<p>"A neatly dressed girl, her hair styled in waves, wearing a pretty and bright cheongsam trailing at her heels, with her round legs showing between the long slits, paired with light beige stockings and embroidered floral round-toe white satin shoes, gracefully walking on the road, truly attracting attention. Unfortunately, at this time, a boorish man rushed from behind and hastily stepped off the heel of this girl's shoe, truly embarrassing! The back of the stocking had a hole in it, and coincidentally a little rascal walked by, saw it, clapped his hands and shouted, 'Ah! Broken stocking!' The passersby followed her, pursing their lips and laughing. At this time, the girl's embarrassing shape and shameful attitude can only be captured with a camera."</p>
<p>"A woman who always advocates singleness in front of her friends, initially with a very strong will, but after not many years, her friends encounter her again, see her with one child on the left and one on the right, and when they ask her about the situation when she used to advocate singleness, this woman must be pitifully ashamed."</p>
<p>"..." There are many more things women are ashamed of. If I were to write down everything I heard, even I would be shy for the women.</p>
<p>These are all materials obtained from the X Society's after-party event.</p>
<p>Awakening</p>
<h3>Inspiration from Film</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Since getting married, I haven't found a suitable job, and life has been precarious. I used to be able to make a home anywhere, but having a wife means having to take care of our shared life, so when I feel like I have to find a way to get bread for tomorrow, I tend to curse fate. If we accidentally speak a little louder, it becomes an unnecessary drama of arguing. Everything in the world is built on material things. Since we are humans who have to eat every day, we are naturally unsatisfied, and when we can't be satisfied, we want to find an opponent to vent our anger on. So, every time we argue, it always ends with mutual understanding and further encouragement to work hard.</p>
<p>Yesterday, under the whip of life, we were able to catch our breath a little, and the two of us went to a mid-range movie theater to see "Humanitarianism," which was titled by philanthropist Mr. Shi Qinglan and caused a sensation. Many movie supplements and newspapers have already criticized the value of this film. It uses the Shaanxi disaster as its background and depicts the sins of the city. The contrasting texts in the film serve as a wake-up call to those living in a drunken dream.</p>
<p>On the way back, my wife said with emotion, "Eating tree bark and grass roots is really bitter. We still have white rice to eat every day. From now on, I won't envy other people's Western-style houses and cars. There are many people who are more miserable than us!"</p>
<p>A woman's vanity is innate. Since she married me, she hasn't lived a lavish life in the city. After seeing "Humanitarianism," she was able to sympathize with the plight of the poor. I smiled and said, "That's my wife!"</p>
<p>"Wasn't I before?" She glanced at me resentfully and then laughed along.</p>
<p>We returned happily, and everything in the room didn't seem as hateful as usual. Everything seemed to have a vibrant spirit. Our lives were still in heaven. I felt even more courageous to fight. This is the inspiration the film gave us.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an argument broke out on the street. I opened the window and saw someone in a car slapping a rickshaw puller at a street corner. He got in the car and drove off.</p>
<p>"Those who sit in cars are people, and those who pull rickshaws are also people," my wife said angrily. "Tell him to go see 'Humanitarianism'!"</p>
<p>"Humph!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"They just take out a one-dollar bill from a stack of hundreds of dollars and say, 'Take it, I saved a life too,' ("Humanitarianism" scene)"</p>
<p>"Heh...heh," my wife's bitter smile.</p>
