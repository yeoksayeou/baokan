<p>時評教育經費急應獨立　目前我國教育破產之情狀。吾人既已於日前「教育破產與政府責任」一評中。予以詳盡之陳述矣。政府視教育為裝飾門面之點綴品。故一任經費之積欠。學校之關門。教職員之饑餓。青年之失學全國教育界之號泣呼籲。皆置若不聞不見。軍費不可不按月開支一千八百萬元之鉅。而教育經費。則儘可拖延停發逹半載之久。坐致全國弦歌絕響。危及立國之根基。此種誤國甚且禍國之舉措。就言國家財政支絀。亦難曲予原諒。立國於二十世紀之國家。而有若斯之現象。此誠為咄咄怪事。　　依據中國國民黨之政綱。其對外政策第五項有云。「庚子賠欵。當完全劃作教育經費。」對內政策第十三項有云。「勵行教育普及。以全力發展兒童本位之教育。整理學制系統。增高教育經費。並保障其獨立。」今國民黨已主政五年矣。此政綱實行之程度究如何。十七年七月舉行之全國財政會議。對於教育經費獨立並保障一案。曾經大會决議通過。十七年至今已四年矣。此議案實行之程度如何。十九年四月第二次全國教育會議宣言有云。「我们希望政府能不辭任何艱難。就本方案所定的預算內籌足必需的經費。並且實行保障經費的獨立。使得現有的整理和逐期的改進。都不受絲毫的影響」關於經費的來源。亦有具體决議。而於教費獨立一案。更鄭重决議云。「教育经费。应保障其獨立。乃總理之遺教。無庸贅述。根據教育經費獨立之原則。應採用特别會議制度。其地方税收指定用作教育經費者。一經確定。不能移作他用。中央税收指定用作教育經費者。一經確定。亦不能移作他用。」十九年至今。近兩年矣。此决議實行之程度如何。去年五月間舉行之國民會議通過之約法中第五章第五十二條亦有云。」中央及地方應寬籌教育上必需之經費。其依法獨立之經費。並予以保障。」約法至少限度。當為中央政府先自應恪守者。今約法確立已近一年。其遵守並實行之程度又如何凡此政綱與約法以及各種會議之宣言與决議。昭示煌煌固十分神聖荘嚴不容政府首先違犯者今黨綱不能實現。約法不能恪守。决議不能實行徒日以不兑現之宣言文吿昭示國人。是欺民也。吾人在今日目擊全國教育破產青年失學。教育界泣血呼籲之慘狀。更一念及我國家民族根基摇動臾來日危機之深重。誠不能不痛心疾首於政府之忽視教育與貽害青年也。教育為立國之命脈。吾人既已三復言之矣。以今日情勢而觀。政府殆無覺醒之動機。政府而長不覺悟。則為拯我民族固我國本計。全國教育界亟應奮起。堅决奮門。挽救教育。爭取教育經費。並保障其獨立。即以保存我國家之一綫生命。從當前事實之教訓。吾人當可以灼見泣血呼籲。於實際毫無補。益絕不足以醒政府諸公之迷萝。而動其惻隱。就令泣血乞憐之結果。得特蒙優渥。撥給少數之經費。而下月又將如何。明年又將如何。長此以往又將如何。故教育界人士為維護國本計。培植青年教育計。職責所在。應一反請願乞憐之方式。奮起抗爭。作廣大之救教運動。抗爭之道則如何。曰集合全國教育界之力量。以抗爭之方式。要求政府實現教育經費獨立。并予以確切之保障。其具體之辦法為（一）教育經費之標準。應照現代國家佔税收全数之普通百分比。（二）劃定某一種或數種税收專充教育經費。（三）劃定充作教育經費之税收。由教育界組織委員會直接微收并保管。（四）劃定之税收。絕對不准提作他用。（五）全部庚欵仍須維持用之於發展教育之原議。不准移作他用。駐漢日領要求取銷反日運動（漢口）聞日領向警部提出要求、取銷反日運動、（二十五日專電）何竸武談平漢鐵路積弊（漢口）何競武談、此次視察平漢路、發現積弊甚深、如用煤過多、及軍隊包運商貨之事、所在皆有、沿途枕木多腐朽、致二十五晨煤車在廣水出軌、今後當先查積弊所在、再定整理方法、（二十五日專電）喩育之赴鄂財廳視事（漢口）喩育之二十五赴財廳視事、據談、管業執照税徴收與否、尚在審查擬議中、開源仍待匪患肅清、節流由各機關曾商、統籌全局、盡量核减、至積債一律設法酌還、俾維信用、俟難關過後、再從發展生產着手、同時省府准前廳長吳國楨辭職、並代轉中央、（二十五日專電）于右任赴中山　　中央擬設西南綏靖區　　　　伍朝樞就主席否未定　（香港）于右任二十五午、偕张惠长唐紹儀赴中山、留一二日即來港北返、（二十五日專電）（香港）中央擬設西南綏靖區、設正副主任各一內定陳濟棠白崇禧充任、（二十五日專電）（香港）馮祝萬呈中央、由一月起、月撥關餘二百萬、為償還粵民歷年擔負革命損失、（二十五日專電）（香港）陳濟棠二十五函十九路後方、派員赴士敏土廠、點收該路存械、（二十五日專電）（香港）伍朝樞二十四晚由省來港、談就省主席否未定、但俟陳策愈後即赴瓇、（二十五日專電）（香港）白崇禧定二十六回桂、（二十五日專電）粵執行部常會（香港）執行部二十五三次常會到陳濟棠蕭佛成鄒魯等十餘人、除商定整理西南黨務辦法外、對留粵中委赴京出席國難會議、亦有討論、議决除推定數人出席外、并擬定提案多種、携京提出、（二十五日專電）陳其采堅辭主計長（南京）陳其采由杭電國府、堅辭主計長職、（二十五日專電）公務員懲委會將成立（南京）公務員懲戒委員會定二月一日成立、委員長擬居正兼任、其餘委員名單、已呈國府任命、（二十五日專電）財部昨開部務會議（南京）財部二十五日開部務會議、討論縮减經費辦法、决由各署司處長、就可能範團內、定一職員减薪辦法、在三十一日前送到、再定期開會討論、（二十五日專電）</p>

<h3>國聯會議開幕</h3>
<p>法代表彭古任主席</p>
<p>通過衛生工作報告</p>
<p>顏惠慶將發表遼案宣言</p>
<p>秘書長德魯蒙提出辭職</p>
<p>▲路透二十五日日內瓦電國聯行政會於今日正午開會、由法總代表彭古主席、中國由顏惠慶博士為總代表、日代表為駐比日大使佐藤、英總代表西　爵士須涅數日到此、現由薛西爾動爵代出席、宣布開會後、薛西爾起立、對於前法外長白里安未能與會、表示憾忱、繼由佐藤表示對薛西爾之同意、謂日本尤或白里安解决中日争端之努力、颜惠慶博士亦起稱譽白里安、谓後此時事之進行、惜未能如前外長之計晝云、行政會今日下午將討論滿洲間題、因中國代表催請從速討論也、路透社探悉顏博士將對全局發表長宣言、並將涉及上海之事變、顏博士以後之步驟、將視行政會之態度而定、今日午後似不致提及對日施經濟裁判部題、公共會議歷一小時之久、於午後一時宣布延會至五時三十分、於是乃舉行非公開會議、討論國聯秘書長德魯蒙爵士辭職事、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯社電國聯會行政院已通過前届衛生委員會工作報告、其中最重要者為關於中國水災之救濟、▲哈瓦斯日內瓦電今日午後行政院各會員國代表舉行秘密會議、當由德魯蒙宣讀其辭職書、德魯蒙此舉關係重要、經行政院各會員請其注意此次會議為時甚短、全體意見均以為德魯蒙若允打銷辭意、其有禆於國聯會實非淺鮮、結果行政院與德魯蒙約定於星期四開一秘密會議、將此部問題從長討論、</p>
<p>▲國民二十四日日內瓦電國聯秘書長德魯蒙爵士、久有辭職之說、今日傳之益為確鑒、謂渠將於明日理事會開會時提出辭呈、國聯中人既未否認、亦不作徴實之言、國聯今日正在多事之秋、而爵士忽萌退志、衆殊為之不解、據消息靈通方面稱、爵士辭職非全出本心、蓋有人隂謀排擠、故與為難、而使不安於位、俾其引退後可以法人繼其闞云、</p>
<h3>商订不侵犯约俄羅談判决裂</h3>
<p>▲國民二十四日巴黎電據羅馬尼亞京城消息、俄羅兩國間關於締結互不侵犯協約之談判、已完全决裂、其原因為羅馬尼亞堅决要求蘇俄承認羅國對比薩拉比亞之主權、而蘇俄則視該地為共聯邦之完整部份、故力加拒絕、據政界消息、法國擬乘俄外長李維諾夫參與日內瓦軍縮會議之機、勸俄對羅讓步、蓋俄羅談判之失敗、將令法俄協約不能批准、因法國前聲明非蘇俄與波蘭訂成同樣之協約、則法國不能批准、羅為法之聯盟國、俄羅協約之成立、固類於俄波協約也、</p>
<h3>土耳其波斯邊界協約簽字</h3>
<p>亞洲五國同盟先聲</p>
<p>▲國民二十四日德黑蘭電土耳其波蘭邊界協約、已於今日在此由波外相阿禮及土外長魯煦第簽字、魯氏昨日由安戈拉專誠乘飛機抵此、簽字前曾入觀波王該約之成功、多由蘇俄撮合之力、魯氏公畢、劉乘飛機赴報逹、擬力勸伊拉克加入俄波士所凝組織之亞洲集團、</p>
<h3>西班牙事變方興未艾</h3>
<p>共黨煽動民衆反共和</p>
<p>▲國民二十四日瑪德里電革命形勢今日未有進步、國內表面雖見安靜、但危機潛伏、隨時有爆發之虞、巴塞洛那總罷工仍堅决維持、目下雖除搶刦糧食店外、未有其他事端、但大規模事變正在醖釀中、京中現甚安謐、惟軍隊均留營戒備、當局刻仍從事搜捕極端派之首領、與封閉彼等之報館、但於大局未見若何效果、共產黨發表宣言散播全國、謂初以時機未至、不欲反對共和、今則對壘之勢已成、共產黨擬領導民衆、竭力實行其計劃云、</p>
<h3>倫敦大條巿價㣲長</h3>

<p>教育消息</p>
<p>（要聞）</p>
<h3>蘇教廰長發表談話</h3>
<p>一保障優良局長</p>
<p>二澈底清查教費</p>
<p>蘇教廰長周佛海氏、昨對記者發表整頓江蘇地方教育公共談話、其言頗關重要茲紀於次、本人自蒞事以來、察見各縣教育、多因糾紛迭起、致事業停頓、成效不彰𢲕厥主因、皆由為教育局長者或以經費陷於絕境、無從設施、或以控案糾纏不清、窮於應付、僅圖旦夕之苟、安聊為敷衍以塞責甚至請假辭職、不待核准而遽行、致本廰大部精力、均用於解决地方糾紛之消極方面、幾無睱致力於積極方面之計劃與進行、長此貽誤、胡堪設想、今後對於地方教育、擬極力整頓、惟積重難返、勢非短時期內所能成功、茲擬於第一步、先行下列兩點、</p>
<p>一、保障優良局長、二澈底清　教費、近查教育局長因事被控、已達三十餘、縣廰中案牘如鱗、終日忙於批答、茲姑勿論是非曲直、試檢來牘、其用團體名稱者、如某某學會某某促進會、有無此種團體、是否呈准立案、均屬疑、問其用私人名義者、動輙數十人、名章皆一手造成、迨經澈查、匪惟所陳各節、多係含沙射影之詞、即具呈之輩、亦空中樓閣、渺無其人、公文往復、已稽時日、更使潔身自好之局長治事灰心、刻擬通飭所屬、剴切佈告、嗣後如遇地方控告案件、不准越級呈訴、凡各縣控告校長案件、先呈由教局受理、控告局長案件、先呈由縣府受理、不能裁决時、再由本廰核奪、如不遵令、逕呈來廰者、概不批答、以免稽時廢事、本廰督學、亦必時往各縣、勤加考察、如果局長公正亷明、不辭勞怨、成績優良者、任何控告、鄙人當依法切實保障、决不為其動搖、並實行實究虛坐之法、但遇局長舞弊營私劣跡昭著者、查實後不惟撤職、定即依法懲儆此其一、</p>
<p>本省地方教育經費、近年度統計、已逹一千二百餘萬元教費最多縣分有至五六十萬者、乃往往經費愈多而糾紛愈大夷考其故、殆由主管機關監督不嚴、考核不力、由是預算因濫增、而擴大、教費因侵蝕而短虧、寅支卯糧、甲挪乙欵、已臻羅掘俱窮之境、倘天災人禍、相逼而來、更成不可收拾之局矣、夫以全省年徴一千餘萬之地方教費、現有四百餘萬之學齡兒童、入學者不及百分之二十、耗費公帑、如此其鉅、造就兒童、如此其微、言之可為痛心、刻擬由廰訂定嚴密審核各縣教費决算辦法、並通令各縣未成立稽核委員會者、尅日成立、已成立者、須切實實行稽核、不得敷衍塞責、同時實行縣長及局長辦學考核規程、務使地方教費、澈底清　、剔除積弊、漸循軌範、此其二、</p>
<p>以上兩端、不過為鄙人感想偶及、自忖無當於高深、然教育之基礎、繫乎地方、基礎不固、一切設施、無由進展、以後當就此潛心探討、如有所獲、當更請益於教育界同人、至於地方服務教育界同人、應視教育為神聖事業、勿存派系觀念、勿逞私人意見、勿懹攘奪愆望、平時與教育行政人員、須和衷共濟、遇經費拮据之秋、尤須共體時艱、若故意為難、纏訟莫解、實為教育前途、莫大之障碍、此則本人所切望於地方教界同人者也、</p>
<h3>蘇省中校聯會宣言</h3>
<p>▲教費本年度結虧三百餘萬</p>
<p>教職員已總辭職校長亦將總辭職</p>
<p>江蘇省立中等學校聯合會為教費不勝侵占學校</p>
<p>勢將停頓事宣言云、</p>

<h3>縣長的資格（上）</h3>
<p>前溧陽縣長李君晋芳聲明放棄江蘇省第二届考取縣長資格時附帶的說：『至前在湖北政務委員會試取縣長資格雖無用處自願存留。』這種資格，既已知道它没有用處，何不早點摔到字紙簍裏去？李君對於湖北的縣長資格之所以戀戀不捨，怕是因為他還没有把文憑資格這類東西澈底的看破。</p>
<p>我可以說：縣長資格文憑不但是江蘇的靠住，就是湖北的也靠不住：不但是湖北的靠不住，運那考試院院長親自主試的都靠不住。</p>
<p>何以見得呢？縣長考試，就已經舉行過的說，有筆試有口試。筆試是考文章：口試是考說話。會做文章會講話的人不一定會做好縣長。有人說在口試時可以在一個人的容貌舉止上看出他的品行的正邪。這樣一來，典試官豈不兼做了看相先生嗎？我從前考錄新進學生也用口試。十幾年的經騐吿訴我，在容貌辭令上判不出眞人才。口試是和筆試一樣的靠不住，分數不代表一個人的眞本領。</p>
<p>戴君傅賢因為一個考生的考試分數算錯自請處分。我當時批評考試的方法說：『考試院的分數怕是全部都算錯了。』你如果把考試院第一次考試的卷子再發給原來閱卷人請他重新批過，將後批分數與前批分數比一比，便知道我的假設可以得到有力的證明。</p>
<h3>亡韓追痛錄</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>黄海涯瀚中。有半島焉。厥為朝鮮。朝當讀若昭。世俗之讀為潮者誤。蓋旭日東升。朝而鮮曄也。人民為箕子後裔。素為我國藩屬。降至清季。倭奴啓覬覦之心。而中日之戰。因之以起。即日俄之　。其爭端亦為朝鮮。倭人之亡韓也。巧為飾辭。其外部覆中國公使云。查朝鮮王常蓄陰謀。致釀禍亂。大為敝國之害。乃其自主力。又屬太薄。不足以鹰重任。其關係於敝國者。不特通商一端而已。地之相去甚近。又有干涉遠方之處。敝國萬難坐視。以妨榮名。是以決計代為設法。以保太平之局。倭人之狡猾。於此可覩。然韓人素沐我國之文明化澤。一旦失其依憑。且苦倭人之壓迫也。於是遂有排倭之運動。漢城西門外。鐘鼓天洞一帶。集會演說。有所謂保安會獨立協興國協會一心會等。皆愛國青年所結合者也。其中一二小軼事。可以歌。可以泣。有不容湮没者。培方學堂之學隆李冰如。斥資以濟愛國志士之所需。為倭警所偵悉。乃搜括其家產而盡没之。冰如至貧窶無以為活。且監視嚴。無敢恤助之者。遂凍餒而死。臨死之頃。猶頻呼韓國萬歲。聲慘烈。聞之令人悚然。又某貴家女。國亡後。隱易姓名。輾轉至倭。入音樂學校。故作唱後庭花之商女。獻媚於倭相伊蕂氏。伊藤好色。素有牡丹宰相之號。遂納之為姫妾。既而伊藤氏赴韓。抵哈爾濱時。安重根伏車驛間狙擊之。蓋女預以氏之行期密報於安也。安被執。慷慨就義。韓人有金澤雄者。賦詩以快之云。平安壯士目雙張。快殺邦仇似殺羊。末死得聞消息好。狂歌亂舞菊花觴。海參港裏　摩空。哈爾濱頭霹火紅。多少六州豪健客。一時匙箸落秋風。其一腔義憤。可於言外見之。韓人固多能詩者。更有某志士不忍目睹亡國之慘。背鄉井而浮海他去。其去國吟云。欲哭不堪哭。欲行不忍行。乾坤雙淚眼。</p>
<p>無處覓秦庭。蒼涼悲感。不堪卒讀。夫朝鮮之亡。我國之殷鑑也。篝鐙寫此時。窗外風聲　颼。有似鬼雄之瞅泣。為之擲筆三歎。</p>

<h3>記國貨仇貨流通展覽會</h3>
<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>自瀋陽事變以來。瞬届四月。我國朝野上下。莫不義憤塡膺。眦裂思報。而抗日救國工作中。尤以抵貨一事。為制敵死命之上策。各界人士。羣策羣力。數月來成效卓著。已陷日人於經濟衰落之地位。國人宣傅抵貨。大抵不外二策。一為舉行國貨展覽會。羅列土產。以昭示於社會。俾人人樂用而利賴之。一為舉行劣貨展覽會。就日常用品之類。凡國人往往購用之日貨。彙列一室。俾人人喬其為仇貨。然後摒棄不復用。二者所採之方法雖不盡同。顧寓意則初無二致。比者于役南翔。復見國立同濟大學抗日救國會有流通國貨仇貨比較展覽會之舉。綜合上述之二策。加以比較。尤見匠心獨運。發人深省。該項展覽。陳列於南翔中心小學。計分二室。簽名後即可入觀。第一室所陳列者為國貨。分學校用品．嗶嘰．布疋．玩具．瓷瓶．日用品等。每項產品。有一標　。上書品名．出產廠家．廠家地址．價値等。不壓求詳。頗具提倡國貨之苦心。予等繞室一週。方知如嗶嘰．花呢等。常人均目為舶來品者。今國人已可自製。不禁喟然感想近年工業界之進歩。而吾儕負提倡之責者。更宜作進一步之研究也。繼入第二室。室之四壁。大書「東洋貨不要買」等標語。及拒絕日貨進口之巨盡。另列日商行名及出品等。率皆精密無遺。日貨所陳列者。以日用品為多。絲綢布疋等次之。食物亦佔一部分。另集東北事變之攝影片五十餘幀。公開展覽。並附說明。該會職員。復殷勤勸導參觀者宜具愛用國貨拒絕日貨之决心。熱忱如此。可佩也。聞該項展覽。前曾於上海及寶山各舉</p>
<h3>北遊影象及其他（七）</h3>
<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>▲電影明星胡蝶女士之自述</p>
<p>北平的女學生「學生時代」這一個可愛的名詞，到現在是已經成為我自已的萝衷的憧憬。我也曾挟着書包在北平的街上走過，我還得想起當我在學生時代的北平的女學生們的風氣，那種帶有幾分靦覥的神情而低着頭走的，彷彿給時代的輪子轉將過去了；我這一次來，所見到的一切，顯然要活潑得多。伊們的自由車常常追踨着我們的行動，伊們對於我們的工作，似乎比我們還要感覺得有興趣。往往在每一個夜裏，能够從電話中間聽到許多清爽的女子的音吐，來探詢我們明天的工作場合，還有人拿了我的現成的照片很珍重地請我簽名留個紀念；還有人拿着啼笑因允緣的書本給我對着攝影時的談話。自然；我應該給我自已</p>
<p>以悵惘的，為什麼我自已的學生時代僅僅給予我以渺小的回憶呢？▲熱烈的　衆當然，不僅是北平時女同學們給我們以相當的鼓勵；在我們工作的時候，實在没有一次能够避去　衆的秩序的包圍的。他們對於這一個影片裏情節，似乎比我們還要知道得多些，往往不等到我們的表演開始，他們就能够預先測知我們所表演的是那一節事情了。後來，在我們攝製另外三個影片時，他們也一樣能夠知道這不是啼笑因緣；於此，</p>
<p>可以反證出他們對於何麗娜沈鳳喜關秀姑樊家樹等人的故事的熟習。▲有聲有色我們的工作，並不專為「啼笑因緣」，同時，還有其他的三個影片同時開攝。我自已，工作固然繁重得多，但興趣也新奇得多，因為在影片的攝製方面，顯然和在上海攝製「紅涙影」與「如此天堂」是大不相同了：「四逹通」片上發音機給我們收取最清晰的聲音，「美的顏色」五彩攝影機給我們盡出最自然的景象；我們托庇於奇妙的科學之下，使我們的工作能够有兩重最眞實最美滿的保障。我想起了在「歌女紅牡丹」中的幾聲「香姐」的呌喊，我又想起了在「紅蓮寺」中的幾朶「紅雲」的浮昇；此後，應該有更好的成功吧！</p>

<h3>記夢</h3>
<p>— 冥飛</p>
<p>夜中忽夢見吾友卓吾。鳴呼．吾日冀吾卓吾之持還也。今旬有餘日矣。卓吾以十二月十二日由上海之如阜。十三日午。船行至七望沙而火。卓吾遂無消息。天寒海闊。卓吾其尚生耶。母老子幼。卓吾而竟死耶。我不能不絕望。而不忍絕望。乃今寗遂僅能於夢中見之耶。嗚呼。我何以為心乎卓吾之行也。以放江北冬振。且臨其友馬述之之喪。與外姑及友葛序東又一小婢俱。方火之作。其鄉人于姓夫婦倉皇乞計。卓吾率以登舵樓。俾各持浮水具。且縋小婢於水。其從容如是。今于姓夫婦皆自水中獲救。其外姑之尸亦</p>
<p>得諸常熟縣境之海灘。（葛君尸旋亦尋獲）而卓吾之或生或死。迄不敢知。我懸懸心目。亦既有曰。夢之所以作耶。我生窮愁潦倒。卓吾語人。冥飛侘傺。多遭不幸竊𢣷其以狂死。同於徐文長。嗚呼。生我者父母。知我者鮑子。卓吾果何往耶。中華民國二十年十二月二十八日。</p>

<h3>戎馬雙樓記（一二）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第三回瑜亮同来竟使筵席易散君邢相避不知盒誰遺然而一個演員在將要登場演劇之先。也自有一種演員們心理上的踧踖不安。安玉田就在這個誠惶誠恐狀態下。陡又似患了心臟木症一般。無知無覺不聞不見的呆站在那裏。後來還是梁笑雲工作完畢。恍惚存了一點女為悦已者容的念頭。轉過臉來對他笑了一笑。想問問他臉上粉可曾擈匀。却見他兩眼發直。似乎魂靈兒已經出舍。這倒反而又害得梁笑雲大吃一驚。忙放下那金盒子。走過來。</p>
<p>拍了他一下肩膀道。㕭㕭你怎麼又艱呆啦。我看你近來受的剌激過甚。腦子受了重傷。别要變成神經病才好。我現在雖要去了。私下實是不放你的心。回頭你等那位客來過了之後。我勸你還是早早安歇。别更要胡思亂想。多找愁煩。顧住了你自已寶貴的身體罷。你家如今已剩下你一個人。你再不愛惜你自已。教我旁邊看了多麼難過。安玉田經這一拍。如夢初醒。運忙揺揺頭回答道。没有會什麼。請你放心走罷。梁笑雲整了整身上的衣裳。順手又摸着那手提皮子。仍望着安玉田說道時候已不早了。你那個客怕就要來了。我這就回去。明天在家裏靜等着你來。你不來可不行的呀。規規矩矩。我與你說實在的。你不要再那麼發愁。不拘有什麼天大的事。都與我想開些。若肯和我商量。我認為什麼事都自有辦法。明天你去到我那裏。我自會細細的與你談。你記着了嗎。說時。就此走出室外。安玉田自也並着肩</p>
<p>兒送伊一程。在路上伊千叮嚀萬吩咐的那些纏綿情話。安玉田總是唯唯諾諾。表示出於衷心的接受。一直送到大門外。親扶伊上了汽車。還瑣瑣碎碎囑咐了一陣。才行分别。這裏安玉田在門外石階上守侯着伊汽車走遠了以後。胸口下所有七上八下的吊桶。好似全已平靜。不由重重的噓了一口氣。暗䀞了聲好險。可是又還算僥倖。到底没被李問霞趕來碰着。如今郤已不要緊了。一時心病全消。渾身輕快。在走回房去的路上。脚步都矯捷得多。及到屋裏再一看。桌上杯盤狼籍。是剛才没　得呌人將筵席撤去。料想李問霞總快來到。被伊看見這些殘肴剩酒。難免還要動問。一不小心回答得不妥。仍是有些糾葛。便又把茶房呌來。命他趕快把這些碗盞收拾了走。誰知剛撤去了一半。室外又聽得一片高跟皮鞋格登格登的聲響。。</p>

<h3>標粉初疲繼俏</h3>

<h3>麥巿堅穩</h3>

<h3>小論壇浪費幸</h3>
<p>英國的大思想家威爾士對於「浪費」，認為是「人類的殃禍」，與老，病，貧，死，同列為「人類之敵」，而極力攻擊。當然，這裏所說的「浪費」，是總括着物質的浪費，精神的浪費，與時間的浪費三者而言。</p>
<p>我以為浪費還應分為無意的與有意的兩種看法。各腦力已極度疲勞而仍繼續讀書，必至書自書而我自我，毫無心得，白費精神與時間．這種浪費是不自覺的，無意的。至於嫖，賭，鴉片，賽馬，酒地花天等，物質，精神，時間，同時蒙受無可補償的損失，這種浪費是有意的，自覺的，簡直是一種罪惡。有意的犯這種罪恶的人，在上海，</p>
<p>舉自皆是。你試一注意一般人的生活：上午十二時起床，已經成為上海人的「習慣法」，否則除非你是天生就的賤骨頭，不得不藉出賣血汗維持一家人的殘生。起床以後，自然是早點一道，繼之以麻雀八圈，其不能麻雀者，則茶樓酒館烟館亦足以消永書，等到萬家燈火初上，精神更是飽足，有汽車的坐汽車，没有汽車的做包車，其尤下者則坐黄包車，電車，分向舞台，俱樂部，賭窟，遊戲場，咖啡店，電影院，跳舞場，妓院拼命地擠，擠，擠，土也似的揮霍金錢，發狂似的斵喪精力消耗時間，等到興致闌珊，打馬回府，已是半晚一二時了，上海人的一天便是這樣混過，上海人的一生也便是這樣的混過。這種極可痛恨的浪費，自然是有其「哲學基礎」，而并不是偶然的，「今朝有酒今朝醉，明日無錢明日憂」。「人生不滿百，常懷千秋憂，盡短苦夜長，何如秉燭遊」，這種「人生哲學」，上海人最能窺其奧秘，最能實踐，所以見面便是：「今天作何消遣呀」？上海人的字典裏只有「消遣」，没有「浪費」人應該生活在消遣裏，應該為，消遣而生活，大舞台的鑼鼓，咖啡店裏的梵華鈴，舞塲裏妖媚的眼睛與白肉，都永盡地招上海人走向消遣之路，上海人，消遣啊，消遣即人生啊！亞門，我當為聰敏的上海人祝福。</p>
<h3>大眾科學空氣是什麼?冰冰</h3>
<p>清清：『上次我們研究出來的是你我一天要吃七千兩百碗空氣，我現在要問究竟空氣是什麼呢？』瑩瑩：『空氣中有兩種氣體：一種是養氣(氧)；一種是淡氣（氮）。』清清：『氧氣是什麼？淡氣是什麼』瑩瑩：『養氣是助燃的；淡氣是不助燃』的。』清清：『什麼呌做助燃？什麼呌做不助燃』瑩瑩：『助燃的意思是帮助東西燃燒；不住然的意思是不帮助東西燃燒。隨便什麼東西在養氣裏就能燃得着，所以養氣有助然性。隨便什麼東西在淡氣裏都燒不着，所以淡氣是有不助燃性。』清清：『你把這兩樣氣分給我看看吧！』瑩瑩：『我們做一個簡單的試騐就知道了。你用臉盆打半盆水，拿一個玻璃杯，用火柴點着一條破紙，放在玻璃杯裏，乘火焰正盛時候，立刻把杯平平的罩在水的中央，停一忽，再提起半寸光景，（不可提出水面）看有什麼變化？清清：『杯裏有許多水進去了這是什麼緣故！』瑩瑩:『氧氣帮助破紙燃燒，破紙燒成炭，與氧氣化合變成炭酸氣，溶化在水裏。所以杯中的氧氣差不多都變了别的東西溶在水裏，騰出的地位給外面大氣把水壓上來佔據了。杯裏除了水之外，現在多半是淡氣了。』清清：『怎麼知道餘下來的氣多半是淡氣呢？』瑩瑩：『因為牠不助燃。東西放在裏面燒不着。你若不信，我們試試看。你把左手放在臉盆的水底，手掌向上，把玻璃杯口移在手掌上，當心不要把玻璃杯口離開水面，不耍給氣進去，然後用右手指拿着杯底，左手掌密密緊緊的托住杯口，翻過來，手掌還耍密密的將杯口壓緊。你看杯底下是水，上面是氣；這氣大部分是淡氣，火在裏面點不着。我來括根火柴試試看.........擦！你把左手拿開，我把點着的火柴放在杯中的淡氣裏。.........你看！』清清：『火柴熄得這麼快呀！』</p>

<p>消息子（消息子即竹製挖耳）絲</p>
<p>馬路轉角鬧盈盈，大車小車如龍行，有人手托消息子，水門汀上冷清清，一領長衫多破洞，滿面風霜瘦伶仃。朋友生意好不好？一天能賣錢多少？偶然來個行路人，問他此言面含笑，他先不答意茫然，後來反問要不要？聞說不要即無言，眼光散蕩馬路邊。</p>
<p>多時賣幾錢？少時賣幾錢？行路人依然問，多少可夠過一天？多時賣一個四開，少時賣幾個銅圓，停了片刻重開口，牙齒震震涕泗漣，不管賣得錢多少，總是耍過一天天。何不改改行？何行最適當？我無靠山難作官，我無本錢難經商，我無學問作才子，我無氣力作强梁！</p>

<p>（★街頭社會學★跪在那裏！一厂）</p>
<p>我每於工作完了之後或晚間，走到西藏路跑馬廰一帶，吸受一些比較清新的空氣。常見着有幾位鬚眉皆白的老太公和幾個雞皮鶴髪的老太婆，跪在跑馬塲圍的鐵欄下，兩眼深陷，無力撑開，在那兒有氣無力似斷似續的央求着要錢。</p>
<p>有錢無錢給與他們，那就要碰摩登先生和摩登小姐的高興了。有時倒還是那些穿粗布衫的男女朋友們，多給他們一兩個銅板。</p>
<p>「老有所終，」是人畢的要則。為什麽逼得他們「老無所終，」天天跪在那裏？孤老院亦有從速設立之必要，使他們「老有所終」吧。「老吾老以及人之老，」願全上海人士注意及之。</p>

<h3>上海故事</h3>
<p>（十九）周容編譯</p>
<p>（上海故事）</p>
<p>×刀匪據城之影響</p>
<p>自官匪交爭以來，十七月之問，租界方面之商業大受影響。時太平天國亦正興盛，自鎭江以上，長江流域，皆為太平天國所封鎖．故長江沿岸各商埠，貿易幾完全解體，一蹶不振，浙江省大部亦同時為太平天國所佔，故上海之內地貨物，全無進口者，刀匪雖即吿平，然人心惶惶，仍感不安，購買力亦隨之減低。進口各貨，如棉紗之類，皆屯積棧房，毫無銷路。</p>
<p>當時各種商業皆形停滯，獨鴉片一項，入口突然激增，此物仍係英人所包運．來自外洋運至吳淞口即用小船輸入，偷運上岸。在一八四七年至四九之間，一年之鴉片平均入口總數為一萬八千八百十四箱，平均價値為一千一百十八萬五千元；至一八五三年，遂增至二萬四千二百箱，價値為一千四百四十萬元。此後數年之間，又增至三萬三千零六十九箱。當時小刀會人皆吸食鴉片為一大僱客，故英商暗中庇護至為盡力，唯法商不能享有此種原利，故租界內之英人助匪，而法人助官，此帝國主義者在華因各人之利益不同而自相紛歧之一證也。」刀匪佔城，對於各項貨品之進口除鴉片外，雖大有影響，但海外對於華貨入口之需要反而大增。即以華茶而論，安徽，江西，福建，浙江等省之茶，由陸路運至上海出口者，在一八五三年，為六千九百萬磅，次年因刀匪佔城，驟減至五千萬磅，至一八五五年，刀匪退出縣城，又激增至八千萬磅，較之一八五三年，增加一千一百萬磅，可見當時海外對於華茶需要之增加頗速。</p>
<p>絲業亦如茶市。一八五一年，出口絲為二萬零三百六十包，一八五三年增至五萬八千三百十九包。自南京為太平軍所據，人民困苦不堪。無力購買絲織物．故蘇杭一帶所產之絲，不得不向海外尋覓市塲，因此出口超過進口，現銀流入，足以維持對外貿易均衡之勢。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Provoke Trouble on Qin Island (Beiping)</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Japanese troops on Qin Island suddenly claimed that 500 meters of installed wiring had been stolen, forcing our side to acknowledge this as a fact and setting a deadline for a response, otherwise they would take independent action and conduct a search. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Mail Plane Flies to Heihe (Harbin)</p>

<p>Central Provisional Standing Committee Resolves to Retain Sun Ke (Nanjing)</p>
<p>After Sun Ke went to Shanghai on the 24th, he submitted a request to the Central Government to resign from the position of President of the Executive Yuan. His secretary, Chen Jianru, also went to Shanghai that night. The Central Provisional Standing Committee held a meeting on the afternoon of the 25th and resolved to retain Sun in his position. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing)</p>
<p>He Yingqin, Zhang Ji, Ju Zheng, Ye Gongchuo, Zhang Renjie were ordered by the Standing Committee to take the night train to Shanghai to persuade Sun Ke to stay. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing)</p>
<p>After today's Standing Committee meeting, Wang [Jingwei] met with Ye Gongchuo at the Party Headquarters and talked for a long time about the matter of retaining Sun Ke. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing)</p>
<p>The reasons for Sun Ke's resignation are: first, there is no solution to the diplomatic situation; second, the establishment of three agencies in Guangzhou is contrary to the original agreement made in Shanghai on the thorough abolition and unification of the Guangzhou government. In addition, Hu Hanmin's departure is delayed, and Sun feels that it is difficult to support a responsible government, so he submitted his resignation. After today's Standing Committee resolved to retain him, Wu Tiecheng was also asked to persuade Sun nearby to return to the Yuan immediately and reluctantly continue his work. There are still many Central Committee members who are not in the capital, some are unable to spare time due to local affairs, and it is difficult to guarantee that there are none who are afraid to share responsibility for the unsolvable diplomatic problems. The Central Government has decided to send a letter urging them to come, and said that Central Committee members should embrace a position of leadership and be willing to endure hardship and share the national crisis. If they intend to evade responsibility, it will prevent the participants in the National Crisis Conference and the National Salvation Conference from enthusiastically participating, so they should set an example. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Li Wenfan, carrying a central mandate, went to Shanghai on the morning of the 25th to meet with Sun Ke for consultations. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Executive Yuan Continues to Appoint Members of the National Crisis Conference and Urges Members from All Regions to Proceed to the Meeting Place at the Lishi Society (Nanjing)</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan continued to appoint 28 members to the National Crisis Conference. The list is as follows: Wang Fu, Wang Zhenwu, Zuo Shunsheng, Guang Sheng, Ren Hongjun, Song Yuanyuan, Li Yongxiang, Li Genyuan, Gu Zhengding, Yu Jiaju, Wu Gongyi, Wu Pengling, Lin Xueheng, Yu Xianting, Zhou Zhenlin, Xu Fosu, Lu Jingshi, Tao Yin (Tao Zhigong), Xu Kecheng, Chen Anren, Chen Qitian, Zhang Zigui, Zhang Xunqin, Chang Naide, Wen Zongyao, Niu Yongjian, Peng Yunyi, Huang Zhanyun, Ye Xiasheng, Zhao Zhengping, Zhao Shuyong, Zhao Hengti, Liu Tianyu, Liu Shumo, Liu Fu, Xu Xiu, Xie Yingbo. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing)</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan telegraphed the Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Beiping, Zhou Dawen, and the Mayor of Tianjin, Zhou Longguang, on the 25th, stating that the date of the National Crisis Conference is imminent and that the letters of appointment may not be delivered before the deadline. Please urge the members living in the city to proceed to Beijing immediately to share the national crisis, and telegraph the travel schedule in advance for reception. The railway and transportation departments have been instructed by the railway and shipping bureaus to allow them to travel free of charge, as was done for the representatives of the National Assembly. Please contact them nearby and issue passports to prove their identity. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing)</p>
<p>The Secretariat of the National Crisis Conference has scheduled its first meeting for the 26th to discuss preparatory matters and the allocation of responsibilities. The meeting place has been decided to be the auditorium of the Lishi Society and preparations are underway. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing)</p>
<p>The Secretariat of the National Crisis Conference plans to use the Lishi Society, the Overseas Chinese Reception Center, and the Central Hotel as reception centers for members. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping)</p>
<p>There are many appointed members of the National Crisis Conference in Beiping and Tianjin. It is planned to hold a discussion meeting in Tianjin in the next few days to exchange opinions before deciding on their course of action. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing)</p>
<p>It is feared that the National Crisis Conference will not be able to open in one day. A certain committee member said that the National Crisis Conference is neither a legislative body nor an executive body, but only discusses solutions for the central government's reference. In the past, the one-party dictatorship did not allow other forces to participate in political work. Now that the national crisis is urgent, it is necessary to broaden the channels of communication so that talents outside the party can also have an opportunity to participate in politics. That is the significance. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping)</p>
<p>According to reliable sources today, Duan Qirui has refused the Central Government's invitation to participate in the National Crisis Conference. Zhang Xueliang also seems unlikely to go south due to the pressure of official duties in the north. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Prepares to Protest the Shanghai Incident (Nanjing)</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers the Shanghai Incident to be a local matter and plans to have the municipal government handle it first. If it cannot be resolved, then a protest will be lodged through diplomatic channels. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared a letter of protest, which will be presented when necessary.

<p>Amidst the Japanese's constant provocations, the defenses along the Yangtze River have been arranged by the naval authorities to deploy various warships in key locations to effectively protect foreign nationals. The security along the route from Nanjing to Shanghai has also been allocated by the Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison Commander's Office to various units for close patrol. Therefore, although there have been rumors in recent days, order can be maintained without worry. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Central Committee Members Talk at Lishi Society, Wang Jingwei Talks about Finance and Diplomacy (Nanjing)</p>
<p>Central Committee members Wang Zhaoming and others went to the Lishi Society on the morning of the 25th after the Central Commemoration Week to hold a discussion meeting to exchange opinions on the Standing Committee meeting held in the afternoon. Ju Zheng, Chen Gongbo, Feng Yuxiang, Gu Mengyu, Li Jishen, Li Zongren, and others attended. After the meeting adjourned at 12 o'clock, Wang went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to visit Chiang [Kai-shek] for discussion. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing)</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei answered questions from reporters from various newspapers at the Central Party Headquarters on the morning of the 25th: (1) On the issue of Japan, the central government's opinions have become consistent, and the countermeasures taken are not convenient for individuals to express opinions to the outside world. However, it can be stated that no matter how difficult it is, the principle of not losing national prestige or humiliating sovereignty will be upheld. This time, our country has requested the League of Nations to invoke Articles 15 and 16 to sanction Japan. If the League of Nations cannot accept it, our country will take further effective measures. Regarding the riots of Japanese nationals in Shanghai this time, the central government has countermeasures. If the Japanese side actually implements violent actions, our country should make the greatest determination to deal with them. In short, since the other side started it, there should be a limit to forbearance. The international opinions in Shanghai in recent days can already prove where right and wrong lie. (2) Regarding the issue of reorganizing finance, there is no other strategy than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. However, increasing revenue must take into account the actual situation before it can be started. As for reducing expenditure, the central government has already implemented a austerity policy. The most important thing now is the reorganization of public debt. If it is not absolutely necessary, we will never issue more public debt and increase the burden on the people. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Concrete Decisions Made on Foreign and Financial Policies (Nanjing)</p>
<p>Concrete decisions have been made on various foreign and financial issues by the Central Provisional Standing Committee on the afternoon of the 25th. According to Central Committee member Chen Gongbo, various issues will be submitted to the Central Political Conference for voting on Wednesday. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chen Youren Submits Resignation, Central Government Decides to Approve Immediately (Nanjing)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary: Educational Funding Must Be Made Independent Immediately</p>
<p>The current state of bankruptcy in Chinese education. We have already given a detailed account of this in our previous commentary "Educational Bankruptcy and Government Responsibility." The government regards education as a mere decoration, so it allows the accumulation of arrears in funding, the closure of schools, the starvation of teachers and staff, and the loss of education for young people. The crying and appeals of the national education community are ignored. Military expenses must be paid monthly with a huge sum of 18 million yuan, while educational funds can be delayed and suspended for as long as half a year, resulting in the extinction of music and education throughout the country and endangering the foundation of the country. Such a move, which harms the country and even brings disaster to the country, is difficult to forgive even in terms of the country's financial difficulties. It is truly an astonishing thing for a country established in the 20th century to have such a phenomenon.</p>
<p>According to the political program of the Kuomintang, the fifth item of its foreign policy states: "The Boxer Indemnity should be completely allocated to educational funds." The thirteenth item of its domestic policy states: "Practice popular education to fully develop child-centered education, reorganize the school system, increase educational funds, and guarantee its independence." The Kuomintang has been in power for five years now. What is the degree of implementation of this political program? At the National Financial Conference held in July of the 17th year [of the Republic], a resolution was passed on the case of independent educational funding and guarantee. Four years have passed since the 17th year [of the Republic]. What is the degree of implementation of this proposal? The declaration of the Second National Education Conference in April of the 19th year [of the Republic] stated: "We hope that the government can overcome any difficulties and raise the necessary funds within the budget set by this plan, and implement the guarantee of independent funding, so that the existing reorganization and gradual improvement will not be affected in the slightest." There were also specific resolutions regarding the source of funding, and a more solemn resolution on the case of independent educational funding stated: "Educational funding should be guaranteed its independence. This is the teaching of the President Sun Yat-sen and need not be reiterated. According to the principle of independent educational funding, a special conference system should be adopted. Once the local tax revenue designated for educational funding is determined, it cannot be used for other purposes. Once the central tax revenue designated for educational funding is determined, it cannot be used for other purposes." Nearly two years have passed since the 19th year [of the Republic]. What is the degree of implementation of this resolution? Article 52 of Chapter 5 of the Provisional Constitution passed by the National Assembly held in May of last year also states: "The central and local governments should generously raise the necessary funds for education, and the legally independent funds should be guaranteed." At the very least, the Provisional Constitution should be the first to be observed by the central government itself. It has been nearly a year since the Provisional Constitution was established. What is the degree of compliance and implementation? All these political programs and the Provisional Constitution, as well as the declarations and resolutions of various conferences, are bright and sacred and should not be violated by the government first. Now, the party program cannot be realized, the Provisional Constitution cannot be observed, and the resolution cannot be implemented. Empty, unfulfilled declarations are used to announce to the people. This is deceiving the people. Today, we witness the tragic situation of national education bankruptcy, the loss of education for young people, and the weeping and appeals of the education community. Moreover, with the thought that the foundation of our country and nation is shaking and the crisis in the near future is profound, we cannot help but be heartbroken by the government's neglect of education and harm to young people. Education is the lifeblood of the country. We have already said it three times. Judging from today's situation, the government has almost no motivation to awaken. If the government does not awaken for a long time, then, in order to save our nation and consolidate the foundation of our country, the national education community should rise up urgently, stand up resolutely, save education, fight for educational funds, and guarantee its independence, so as to preserve a glimmer of life for our country. From the lessons of current facts, we can clearly see that crying and appealing are of no practical help and are absolutely not enough to awaken the government officials from their confusion and move their compassion. Even if the result of crying and begging is to be specially favored and allocate a small amount of funding, what will happen next month? What will happen next year? What will happen if this continues in the long run? Therefore, for the sake of maintaining the foundation of the country and cultivating youth education, educators should, as their duty, reverse the method of petitioning and begging, rise up and fight, and carry out a broad educational salvation movement. What is the way to fight? That is to gather the power of the national education community to demand that the government realize the independence of educational funds and give it a definite guarantee. The specific methods are: (1) The standard of educational funding should be the ordinary percentage of the total tax revenue of modern countries. (2) Designate a certain type or several types of tax revenue specifically for educational funding. (3) The tax revenue designated for educational funding should be directly collected and kept by the committee organized by the education community. (4) The designated tax revenue must never be used for other purposes. (5) All Boxer Indemnity funds must continue to be used for the original proposal of developing education and must not be used for other purposes.</p>

<p>Tan Zhen Delivers a Speech in the Legislative Yuan (Nanjing)</p>
<p>In the morning of the 25th, at the Legislative Yuan Commemoration Week, Tan Zhen reported that although the Chinese people have recently known to pay attention to mass training, most of the expressions of the mass movement are superficial habits, simply shouting slogans and pasting slogans, unable to unite the spirit. In this process, unexpected delays have been discovered. For example, the Japanese goods detained and sealed by the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association are worth 130 million yuan. These goods have already been paid for by the Chinese. In the future, they will either be burned or thrown into the ocean. The losses are still borne by the Chinese merchants, and the Japanese side does not suffer the slightest loss. Just imagine, if merchants in one port suffer such a major loss, how can the society, finance, and national economy not be greatly affected? For example, the gradual decline of public bonds on the market is not without reason. Extrapolating from this, there are countless contradictions. He sincerely hopes that everyone will clearly recognize the goal in the future and work hard in practice, taking the four words "sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall" as a good proverb, which can be used to save the country.

It is currently not intended to mobilize the fleet due to the Sino-Japanese dispute. ▲National Society, Washington, 24th: The State Department and the Navy Department remain extremely concerned about the situation in Shanghai. In addition to the destroyer "Pope" sailing from Manila tonight, another destroyer, "McCormick," has already departed from Manila and will first arrive in Hong Kong, then Fuzhou. Wherever an emergency occurs, it will sail at full speed. State Department officials stated that Secretary of State Stimson is currently on vacation and not in Washington.

<h3>League of Nations Conference Opens</h3>
<p>French Representative Poncet Serves as Chairman</p>
<p>Report on Health Work Passed</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing Will Deliver Statement on Liaoning Case</p>
<p>Secretary-General Drummond Submits Resignation</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 25th: The League of Nations Administrative Council met at noon today, chaired by the French representative, Poncet. China was represented by Dr. Yan Huiqing, Japan by Sato, the Japanese ambassador to Belgium, and the UK by Sir Cecil Hurst. After declaring the meeting open, Sir Cecil stood up and expressed his regret that the former French Foreign Minister Briand could not attend. Sato then expressed his agreement with Cecil, saying that Japan also valued Briand's efforts to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. Dr. Yan Huiqing also stood up to praise Briand, saying that it was a pity that the progress of events could not follow the plan of the former Foreign Minister. The Administrative Council will discuss the Manchurian issue this afternoon, as requested by the Chinese representative. Reuters has learned that Dr. Yan will deliver a long statement on the overall situation, which will also involve the Shanghai Incident. Dr. Yan's next steps will depend on the attitude of the Administrative Council. The issue of imposing economic sanctions on Japan is unlikely to be mentioned this afternoon. The public meeting lasted for an hour and was adjourned at 1:00 PM until 5:30 PM, when a closed meeting was held to discuss the resignation of League of Nations Secretary-General Sir Drummond.</p>
<p>▲Havas News Agency: The League of Nations Administrative Council has passed the report of the previous Health Committee, the most important of which is the relief of the floods in China. ▲Havas Geneva: This afternoon, representatives of the member countries of the Administrative Council held a secret meeting, during which Drummond read his resignation letter.

The unanimous opinion was that if Drummond agreed to withdraw his resignation, it would be of great benefit to the League of Nations. As a result, the Administrative Council and Drummond agreed to hold a secret meeting on Thursday to discuss the issue at length.</p>
<p>▲National, Geneva, 24th: There has been talk of League of Nations Secretary-General Sir Drummond's resignation for a long time, and today it is confirmed.

The League of Nations is currently going through a difficult period, and everyone is puzzled by the sudden resignation of the Duke. According to well-informed sources, the Duke's resignation is not entirely of his own free will, but rather a conspiracy to squeeze him out so that he can be replaced by a Frenchman.</p>
<h3>Negotiations Between Romania and Russia Break Down Over Non-Aggression Pact</h3>
<p>▲National, Paris, 24th: According to news from the Romanian capital, negotiations between Romania and Russia on the conclusion of a non-aggression pact have completely broken down. The reason is that Romania insists on Russia recognizing Romania's sovereignty over Bessarabia, while Russia regards the area as an integral part of the federation and strongly refuses. According to political sources, France intends to take advantage of Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov's participation in the Geneva Disarmament Conference to persuade Russia to make concessions to Romania. The failure of the Romanian-Russian negotiations will prevent the ratification of the Franco-Russian pact, because France previously stated that it could not ratify the pact unless Russia and Poland concluded the same pact. Romania is an ally of France, and the conclusion of the Romanian-Russian pact is similar to the Russian-Polish pact.</p>
<h3>Turkey and Persia Sign Border Treaty</h3>
<p>Prelude to the Five-Nation Alliance in Asia</p>
<p>▲National, Tehran, 24th: The Turkish-Persian border treaty was signed here today by Polish Foreign Minister Arlet and Turkish Foreign Minister Rushti.

<h3>Situation in Spain Continues to Escalate</h3>
<p>Communists Incite People to Oppose the Republic</p>
<p>▲National, Madrid, 24th: The revolutionary situation has not improved today. Although the country appears calm on the surface, a crisis is lurking and may erupt at any time.

The capital is currently very peaceful, but troops remain in their camps on alert. The authorities are still engaged in arresting extreme leaders and closing their newspapers, but this has had little effect on the overall situation. The Communist Party has issued a declaration spreading throughout the country, stating that because the time was not yet ripe, it did not want to oppose the republic, but now that the battle lines have been drawn, the Communist Party intends to lead the people and strive to implement its plan.</p>

<h3>Official Telegrams</h3>
<p>Telegram from Chinese Overseas in the United States to the Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association, for the attention of officials of the National Government: Japanese invaders are attacking China, and the demise of the nation is imminent. We request an immediate convening of a National Salvation Conference to collectively confront the national crisis. We, the overseas Chinese, are willing to provide support. Huang Qiao Fu, Chairman of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association in the major cities of America, earnestly pleads.</p>
<p>Telegram from Liuzhou to all newspaper offices for the attention of all fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, aunts in the nation: Disaster has befallen China. Internal strife is frequent, and the Japanese invaders enslave and abuse us, seizing our North and Northeast. With Liaoning and Jilin already fallen, Heilongjiang is in greater peril. The Ma army rises up, fighting bitterly for months. Although their spirit is enough to chill the enemy's courage, their strength is difficult to sustain for long. Our country has many troops, but none have come to join the fight. Our army's generals and soldiers bear the nation's trust and grieve over the loss of territory. With the country in imminent danger, it is our duty to die for the cause. On the first day of the first month, we swore an oath in Yining, pointing our spears northward, willing to sacrifice the entire army rather than let the Japanese invaders succeed. We hope that all compatriots throughout the country will be of one heart and one mind, sharing the same hatred for the enemy and fighting together. The survival of the nation depends on one battle. We humbly present our sincere plea, hoping for your clear understanding. Zhang Fakui, Fourth Army Commander, Wu Qiwei, Deputy Commander, and all officers and soldiers, earnestly plead.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Advances on Rehe</h3>
<p>▲ The Story of the Fierce Battle around Mount Hongluo</p>
<p>▲ Cavalry Third Brigade and Brave Soldiers Fight to the Death</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Officers Suffer Over Ten Deaths and Dozens of Injuries</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: Since the fall of Jinzhou, the majority of our regular army has been ordered to retreat into Shanhaiguan. Remaining outside the pass are only the entire Third Cavalry Brigade and the volunteer army organized by the people. The Japanese army has dispatched a large force to continue the attack. After more than ten days of standoff, both sides have suffered losses. An officer of the volunteer army has come to Tianjin by way of Luan River and Lingyuan, recounting the details of the battle. A record of the account follows: After the Japanese army broke through our army's front line on the Daling River on the second of this month, our volunteer army, led by Geng Jizhou, and the Third Cavalry Brigade, led by Zhang Shusen and Xu Liang, including the 654th and 658th Infantry Regiments, totaling over 5,000 men, detoured through Nuanchitang and Mount Hongluo to concentrate on Jinxi in preparation to intercept the Japanese army entering Luan River. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army dispatched seven or eight planes every day to bomb the positions of our army around Mount Hongluo. The main force, consisting of the Itata and Muroya Brigades, took the road through Dayao Gou and began directly assaulting the rear of our army on the evening of the ninth, hoping to encircle our forces. At that time, our army was in an isolated and unsupported position and had no choice but to make a final sacrifice. They fought with all their might. After running out of bullets, they resorted to hand-to-hand combat, fighting fiercely all night, killing Japanese Colonel Koga, commander of the regiment, and four other officers of the rank of major and below, as well as fifteen junior officers. Over fifty Japanese officers were wounded. It was reported that the quartermaster troops under the command of Lieutenant Matsuo and a large Japanese cavalry unit fell into the chaotic mountains during the night and were ambushed by our army, suffering heavy casualties. On the morning of the tenth, the Japanese army sent a large number of reinforcements and over ten planes to continuously bomb the area around Mount Hongluo and Mount Bijia. Our army suffered over 300 casualties in this desperate situation, and the Japanese army also suffered significant deaths. At this time, our generals, in the absence of weapons and ammunition inside and reinforcements outside, had no choice but to await death. They drafted a final declaration and sent it out by special envoy, stating: "Since the breakthrough of the Daling River front, the people of western Liaoning have been subjected to the ravages of Japanese planes and iron hooves every day. Even the Ten Days of Yangzhou and the Three Massacres of Jiading cannot compare to its cruelty. Our volunteer army, the 678th and other two large battalions, after retreating with our Northeast army and cavalry units to the north side of Mount Hongluo, have exhausted their strength and run out of ammunition and food. The Japanese army continues to advance inch by inch, step by step. Their intention is not to defeat the thousands of remaining defeated troops but to drive straight into Luan, which is already very obvious. Since the brief recovery of Xinmin and Tieling, the Japanese army has become even more concerned about our volunteer army. Therefore, from 6 p.m. on the ninth to 6 p.m. today, our army has engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army in the chaotic mountains around Jinxi. The intensity of their artillery fire and the number of our casualties are many times greater than the battles at Dahugou and Yingxian. The number of enemies killed is also unprecedented. Knowing that Japanese reinforcements are continuously surrounding us, our volunteer army and the remnants of our army, as long as there is a glimmer of hope, will never abandon Jinzhou. We hope that the central government will quickly decide on peace or war, and that the leaders of the Guangdong faction will cease their power struggles. If this is done, our four thousand sons and daughters in the Northeast, even if they all die in battle within a day or two, will smile in the afterlife without regret. If some unrighteous people in the country still use foreign forces as tools for political struggles, so that our four thousand sons and daughters in the Northeast cannot even have an upright name after dying on the battlefield, then there will inevitably be successors to expose their conspiracies after death. We lament in our dying breath, hoping that our countrymen will take heed." On the eleventh, although a large number of Japanese troops arrived, they could not break through the encirclement. Moreover, the number of Japanese deaths on the ninth and tenth was extremely high, so they dared not advance rashly, only using planes to drop bombs and bombard. On the twelfth, the Japanese army, having suffered heavy losses, changed its strategy, shifting westward through Dalu Road, one force entering Kailu from Tongliao, one entering Suidong from Zhangwu, and one entering Fuxin from Xinlitun, in order to form a connected line. There are over 10,000 men of our volunteer army in the Dalu Road area. The Japanese army, starting from Tongliao, reached Qianjiadian and came into contact with the First Cavalry Brigade's Wang Regiment and the Eighth Route of the volunteer army. The Japanese army used armored vehicles to carry infantry, cavalry, and artillery to fiercely fire upon our army. Our army, displaying skill in cavalry archery, resisted with all its might. The Japanese army also used planes to drop bombs and bombard. Our army retreated to the vicinity of Liujia Yuanzi. Meanwhile, the Japanese army in the Jinxi area, using planes for cover, attacked and entered Jinxi City. The Japanese army in the Yixian area also used planes to cover the advance of tanks. Our army had no choice but to retreat to Chaoyang Temple. (January 23rd)</p>

The Shanghai issue is very serious. Such incidents may occur everywhere in the future. Under such circumstances, all comrades must rise up and work hard. Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang have already decided on a solution, but it is not convenient to announce it at this time.

Lin Sen presided and Qin Zhen reported, saying: "In the past week, the environment has been very dangerous and the situation extremely serious. However, there is one thing that can be comforting, that is, Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang and the members of the National Government have successively come to Nanjing, consolidating the central government and discussing ways to deal with the difficult situation. I believe that the difficulties of the current situation are not worth worrying about. As long as we can unite, everything can be solved. As for the government's recent implementation of austerity policies, it is not only due to financial constraints but also to show the spirit of enduring hardship and striving for self-improvement, so that the people are aware and vigilant. The government's recent order to rectify discipline is also of great significance and should not be seen as mere formality. At this time of national crisis, the government and the people must strive forward with the spirit and determination of 'saving the country with personality' in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, so that we can overcome this difficult situation."</p>
<h3>Local Correspondence, Suzhou</h3>
<p>Construction of the military road has stalled. The construction of the road around the city, previously undertaken by the 60th Division stationed in the area, particularly the eastern section, has been delayed because the proposed route requires the destruction of many graves. The Tomb Protection Association, in consultation with local gentry, and chaired by Li Genyuan, resolved to: (1) request the county government to petition the provincial government to change the route; (2) request the Construction Bureau to survey along the pond; (3) stipulate the width of the road to be five meters; (4) send representatives to the province to state their case; and (5) request that representatives be sent to the 60th Division to request a temporary suspension of construction until further notice.</p>

<p>Search for kidnapped victims in Chanpu yields nothing. County Police Captain Ding Zhiyan, to handle the matter of joint coastal defense, went to the Daoyuan Qinchong outer dyke area yesterday, accompanied by the First District Office, to carry out an inspection. Upon arriving at the 11th district, he received a secret report that the Qian Azhao family was harboring kidnapped victims. He immediately rushed to search the house at night, but the kidnapped victims had already been moved elsewhere. Only Qian Azhao and Qian Asi were arrested. According to their confession, on the 28th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, someone, along with Qian Asi, had brought six kidnapped victims from Yanpu (four men and two women) to be guarded on their behalf. However, due to the emergency, they moved them to another location on the night of the fifth day of the twelfth month of the lunar calendar. They have consistently refused to reveal the location of their hideout. The captain has already prepared a document to transfer them to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Jiangbei flood victims are successively sent back.

After receiving the report, Chief Xu immediately dispatched fifteen plainclothes police officers to search the area. They seized over fifty liang of opium on the spot, two sacks containing over thirty thousand red pills, and a opium smoker named Song Genfu. The main culprit, Guo Xiyuan, had already fled upon hearing the news and could not be apprehended. The police brought the captured opium smoker, opium, and red pills to the bureau.

<h3>Sun Ke Expresses Resignation</h3>
<p>Telegraphed Central Government Yesterday Submitting Resignation</p>
<p>Zeng Zhongming Specially Came to Shanghai to Urge Him to Stay</p>
<p>Executive Yuan President Sun Ke, due to the resignation of Foreign Minister Chen Youren, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday. That evening, he met with Chen Youren and others at his private residence. Regarding the diplomatic policy towards Japan, the various committee members in Nanjing held differing views, and a decision could not be reached. Sun's political views could not be implemented, so he also expressed his resignation. After further discussion yesterday morning, Sun also decided to resign, telegraphing the Central Government to submit his resignation as Executive Yuan President. Wang Jingwei specially sent Zeng Zhongming to Shanghai yesterday with a personal letter from Wang, representing a sincere plea to stay. There has been no result. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>▲ Resignation Telegram Sun Ke telegraphed the Central Government yesterday to resign. The original telegram stated: "To the Central Executive Committee Standing Committee, for your consideration, and to Chairman Lin of the National Government, for your consideration: I, Sun Ke, with my limited intelligence, have been entrusted by the Central Government with the position of Executive Yuan President. Considering that the national crisis is urgent, unification has just been achieved, leaders are scattered, and the central government is empty, compelled by the duty to love the party and save the country, I disregarded the advantages and disadvantages and my own limited ability, and reluctantly accepted the great commission, not daring to resign. I hoped that I could exhaust my foolish loyalty, promote unity, and overcome the difficult situation. My sincere intentions are known to you. For the past month, I have been running around and appealing, exhausting my mind and strength. Fortunately, I have received the understanding of Mr. Chiang and Mr. Wang, who resolutely entered the capital, and the central government's major plans have been taken over by others. I have thought again and again that at this time of crisis, the heavy responsibility of the Executive Yuan President cannot be borne without great ability. Considering my own insignificance and lack of ability, although I want to do my best to help resolve the difficulties, I am constrained by circumstances and my views are futile. What benefit is there in being burned out? I believe that the responsibility of transition has been completed, and the worry of repeated advice should be avoided. How can I continue to delay, harming myself and the country? Therefore, I express my sincere feelings and earnestly request permission to resign from the position of Executive Yuan President immediately and select a worthy successor to avoid misleading the country. I am overwhelmed with sincerity and fear. As for the position of Executive Yuan President after my departure from Nanjing, it should be temporarily filled by Deputy Executive Yuan President Chen Mingshu. This is also stated. Respectfully, Sun Ke, on this day."</p>
<p>▲ Refuses to See Guests After Sun Ke suddenly became negative, he refused to see any guests yesterday. This newspaper's reporter met with Mr. Wu Tiecheng yesterday and asked if he had met Sun since his arrival in Shanghai. He replied that he had not met him yet. Minister of the Interior Li Wenfan also arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 5 PM yesterday and went to Sun's residence to discuss matters for a long time.</p>
<p>▲ Sincere Plea Wang Jingwei, who is in Nanjing, heard the news of Sun's resignation and immediately asked Central Committee member Zeng Zhongming to represent him and sincerely plead. Zeng arrived in Shanghai at around 5 PM yesterday, carrying a personal letter from Wang with extremely sincere wording. He immediately went to visit Sun on Moliere Road, asking him to put the party and the country first and go to Nanjing immediately to withdraw his resignation. There has been no result yet.</p>
<p>▲ Temporarily Does Not Leave Shanghai According to sources close to Sun, although Sun has resigned, he will remain in Shanghai temporarily and will not go elsewhere. He hopes to support the central government in a non-official capacity. According to Zeng Zhongming, Sun is still in Shanghai. The report yesterday that he had left Shanghai was inaccurate. However, at this time of national crisis, the central government will not allow him to resign on his own. The mission of my trip to Shanghai is to comfort Mr. Sun and Mr. Chen and persuade them to return to Nanjing and withdraw their resignations.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Ji, Zhang Jingjiang, and Ju Zheng, to persuade Sun to stay, accompanied He Yingqin and Ye Gongchuo, took the night express train from Nanjing last night and will arrive in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Chen Youren Resigns as Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>▲ Telegram to National Government</p>
<p>Before leaving Nanjing, Foreign Minister Chen Youren verbally expressed his resignation to Executive Yuan President Sun Ke. On the 24th, he telegraphed the National Government from Shanghai to formally resign. The original telegram stated: "To the Nanjing National Government, for your consideration: I, Chen Youren, with my meager talents, have been honored to be entrusted by the Central Government with the important task of Foreign Minister. I originally intended to exhaust my humble abilities to repay the party and the country. However, I am shallow in wisdom and short in handling matters. Although I have tried my best to offer my foolish advice, there are many obstacles and difficulties. The national crisis is urgent, and diplomacy is of great importance. Decisions cannot be delayed, and resignation cannot be hesitated. Therefore, I submit my resignation and earnestly request your approval. I am overwhelmed with anticipation. Respectfully, Chen Youren, kowtowing."</p>
<h3>The Japanese Consul Visited the Mayor Yesterday</h3>
<p>Inquiries About Japanese Price Case and Protest Replies</p>
<p>The Embassy Fire Case Requires Detailed Investigation</p>
<p>Envoy Shigemitsu Expected to Arrive Tomorrow</p>
<p>Japanese Consul-General Kuramatsu Murai visited Mayor Tieh-cheng Wu yesterday morning at around 11 a.m. at the Municipal Government to discuss matters. Later, due to circumstances, the appointment was changed to 3:30 p.m. When the time arrived, Mayor Wu was already waiting at the Municipal Government. Subsequently, Japanese Consul-General Kuramatsu Murai, accompanied by Vice-Consul Yasushi Shirai, arrived on time. Mayor Wu, accompanied by Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, received the Japanese Consul-General in the Mayor's reception room. The meeting lasted until 4:50 p.m., when the Japanese Consul-General departed. The meeting lasted for one hour and twenty minutes. The content of Mayor Wu's statement to the New Voice News Agency reporter is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The Japanese Consul Presses for Resolution According to the content released by Mayor Wu, Japanese Consul-General Kuramatsu Murai came to me to ask when a reply could be given to the protest regarding the assault on Japanese monks on Mayushan Road on the 18th. Given the seriousness of the current situation, the attitude of Japanese residents in Shanghai is extremely indignant. If a quick resolution is not reached and there is too much delay, and an accident occurs as a result, the Municipal Government should bear the responsibility. At the same time, he also mentioned that someone set fire to the Shigemitsu Embassy in the French Concession the night before, and anti-Japanese emblems and proclamations were found afterward, and asked for my opinion on this matter.</p>
<p>The Mayor gave a clear response, stating that regarding the four points of the protest raised about the assault on Japanese monks on the 18th, considerable time is still needed to request instructions from the Central Government and to solicit opinions from various foreign entities in Shanghai. This is currently under careful consideration, and a reply will be given as soon as possible. As for the seriousness of the situation, the Mayor is of course very aware, but it is hoped that both Chinese and Japanese people will maintain a calm attitude and wait for the authorities to negotiate through diplomatic channels so that the case can be resolved peacefully. Therefore, both sides should bear the responsibility for this. As for the arson at the Shigemitsu Embassy, even though anti-Japanese emblems and proclamations were found, the truth of the matter requires a detailed investigation. It is possible that someone forged them, hoping to shift the blame onto others. Moreover, leaving behind such evidence after arson seems too foolish. Therefore, this matter requires further study before a statement can be made. At this point, the Japanese Consul-General then departed. The general situation of today's conversation is like this. Because both sides used translators, it unknowingly took a long time, etc.</p>
<p>Shigemitsu Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow Japanese Envoy Mamoru Shigemitsu previously returned to his country to report on the situation in China to Yoshizawa. Due to the tense situation in Shanghai, he shortened his planned stay in Japan and hurried back to his post. According to Consul Iguchi, who told our reporter, Envoy Shigemitsu has already departed from Tokyo yesterday on the Shanghai Maru and will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. The reporter further asked Consul Iguchi what would happen if the Municipal Government's reply was unsatisfactory. Consul Iguchi replied that before the Japanese Navy takes appropriate action, the Japanese Consul-General would issue a final warning to the Municipal Government. The reporter then asked what the scope of the so-called appropriate action was, but Consul Iguchi remained tight-lipped, saying that he could not reveal it.</p>
<p>▲ Three Deny Committing Assault Gong Shouzhong, Gong Shoucheng, and Zhang Huagui, three workers from the Sanyou Industrial Society's main factory who were accused of assaulting Japanese monks, were arrested by order of the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District and sent to the Municipal Police Bureau. Yesterday, they were transferred to the District Court for investigation. Subsequently, Prosecutor Wang held a preliminary hearing, and the defendants all stated that they did not assault the Japanese. They claimed that at the time of the alleged assault, the workers were still working, etc. They were all detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Foreign Residents in Shanghai Uneasy</h3>
<p>▲ But the Consular Corps' Attitude Remains Calm</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Media Reports The Shanghai Evening Post reported that British, American, and French residents in the city were quite uneasy as a result of the tension between China and Japan. However, the diplomatic and military representatives of the three countries stationed in Shanghai remained calm as usual. All told representatives of The Shanghai Evening Post that there was no need to take extraordinary measures to protect foreign residents in Shanghai at this time. Colonel Hawke, commander of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment, said that the current situation did not require stepping up the Marine Corps' defenses. He had not received orders to increase the patrol force, nor had he received notice of any plans to do so. The Fourth Marine Regiment will continue to serve as usual until it receives orders. French Consul-General Gangelin said that the French Consulate believed that there was no need to take special steps in the current situation. The developments in recent days have been regrettable. We have prepared everything and the security of the French Concession can be guaranteed. British authorities said that although they were prepared to deal with any extraordinary situation that might arise, the Sino-Japanese dispute had not yet reached a point where British residents needed special concern or special precautions.</p>
<p>The American Consul Expresses His Opinion Regarding the situation in Shanghai, the attitudes of various countries are noteworthy. A reporter from the China Eastern News Agency visited U.S. Consul-General Edwin S. Cunningham yesterday. He said that the conflict between Japanese residents and Chinese people was a truly unfortunate incident in Shanghai. Yesterday, I received a telegram from the Washington government, instructing me to do my best to protect the lives and property of American residents in Shanghai. If necessary, U.S. warships and sailors will land to protect them. The U.S. authorities in Washington have now dispatched the warship the USS Paul Jones from Manila to Shanghai to prepare for any eventuality. We are paying close attention to the Shanghai case. However, I sincerely hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities can make concessions to prevent the incident from escalating.</p>
<p>▲ The British Navy Expresses Its Opinion A reporter from the China Eastern News Agency then visited the British Navy's Shanghai office. Regarding the attitude towards the Shanghai case, it was said that since the conflict between Japanese residents and Chinese people in Shanghai, people in Shanghai had been panicking. Japan has dispatched a large number of warships to Shanghai. However, the British Navy maintains a calm attitude. In my observation, the Shanghai case can hopefully be resolved peacefully and will not escalate further. Therefore, the British naval community is not sending ships to Shanghai for the time being. However, if the Japanese stage another riot that endangers the lives and property of Chinese residents, the soldiers on the ships stationed in Shanghai will land to protect them.</p>
<p>▲ The Municipal Council Expresses Its Opinion Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, told a reporter from the China Eastern News Agency yesterday that since the Japanese residents' riots, the Concession's defenses had become strained. Since the rumors that the Japanese would riot again the day before yesterday, the Concession authorities had immediately put in place serious security measures. Fortunately, no accidents occurred. However, the people of Shanghai are panicking. Therefore, in the future, the authorities will cooperate with the Chinese authorities on defense matters and do everything possible to deal with the situation. It is hoped that the people of the city will remain calm and stable and not be overly alarmed.</p>
<h3>Labor Representatives Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Maintain Order and Release Workers</p>
<p>According to the Daily News, representatives from more than ten organizations, including the Shanghai Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union, the Fourth District Shipbuilding Industry Union, the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union, the Fourth District Cotton Textile Industry Union, the Seventh District Eleventh Branch Publishing Industry Union, the Postal Workers' Union, the Ninth District Soap and Pharmaceutical Industry Union, the Mercerizing and Dyeing Industry Union, and the Pharmaceutical Industry Union, a total of twenty-two people including Gong Yuting, Wang Baoru, and Chen Yungeng, petitioned the Municipal Government at 10 a.m. yesterday, demanding that Shanghai's security be effectively maintained and that the three arrested workers from the Sanyou Factory be released. Mayor Wu was out on official business, so Secretary-General Yu Hongjun received them. Yu replied that the local government would always be responsible for maintaining security. He was currently coordinating with the Garrison Headquarters to deploy defensive engineering. As for the three arrested workers, they had been transferred to the court. He hoped that representatives could go to the court during the trial and testify that the workers did not assault the Japanese monks, in which case they could be released immediately. The representatives expressed satisfaction and left.</p>
<h3>The National Crisis Assistance Association and Others Urged Mayor Wu to Reject Japanese Demands Yesterday</h3>
<p>Saying Not to Dissolve Anti-Japanese Groups</p>
<p>Wu Expressed That He Would Not Go Against Public Opinion</p>
<p>Since Japan dispatched its fleet to Shanghai, there have been widespread rumors that the municipal authorities will comply with Japanese demands and dissolve various anti-Japanese and national salvation organizations. Last night at 11 p.m., Yin Zhiling and Liu Liumin from the National Crisis Assistance Association, Tan Bozhi and Huang Jingyi from the Xiaonian Assistance Corps, Feng Chu et al. from the Chinese Revolutionary Student Federation, specifically selected Wu, Liu Liumin, Tan Bozhi, and Yin Zhiling to visit Mayor Wu Tiecheng to discuss this matter. Mayor Wu personally received them. Wu Mai, representing them, stated their intentions and said that recently, there have been widespread rumors in the city that the authorities will dissolve the anti-Japanese and national salvation organizations. If the rumors were true, the mayor, as the city's chief official, would likely not escape the public's sense of justice. Mayor Wu replied that, in any case, he would not violate public opinion or yield to Japan's unreasonable demands. He greatly admired the patriotism of all present. It is now reported that the National Crisis Assistance Association plans to convene an emergency meeting to discuss this matter, scheduled for 7 p.m. on Wednesday, the 27th of this month, at the YMCA on Sichuan Road, to convene a general assembly of representatives from all walks of life in the city to discuss emergency public self-defense measures and to ask Wu to report on the latest diplomatic situation to the Central Government. Notices have been sent to all sectors, inviting them to send one to three representatives to participate on time.</p>
<h3>Ke Shaomin and Others Advocate for the Convening of a National Representatives Assembly</h3>
<p>▲ Telegram to Ma Xiangbo and Others</p>
<p>Ke Shaomin from Shandong, Chen Ziyou from Shanxi, Huang Yunpeng and Hui Yiyi from Sichuan,</p>
<p>Duan Yongxin from Gansu, Ding Jin, Shui Junshao, Wang Shaojian, Xu Fude, Chen Yuzhi, Zhang Hesheng, Guo Yiyuan from Jiangsu, Huang Gongsu from Jiangxi, Chen Guangpu from Anhui, Liu Fengzhu from Jilin, He Jihong from Hebei, Wang Jingfang and Hu Rulin from Henan, Zhang Shusen from Shaanxi, Zhang Dongsun from Zhejiang, Tu Wenjun and Hu Jun from Hubei, Fu Yufen from Hunan, Xiang Naiqi, Wu Jianfeng, Yang Yue, Guo Shengxi, Liu Baizhao from Hunan, Tang Shixing from Guizhou, Jiang Han and Chen Ding from Fujian, Gao Jianguo and Yang Daguan from Suining, Ma Jiaju, Li Zifang, Wu Guanyin, Xu Fulin, Chen Shihua, Yi Ruilin from Guangdong, Shen Zhifu and Lin Zhibei, Overseas Chinese, telegraph to Mr. Ma Xiangbo in Shanghai and the gentlemen of the National Crisis Relief Association, and to all citizens of the country via various newspapers: You, along with others, responded to the telegram requesting an inquiry into the facts of He Yingqin's winter telegram of last June. Your righteous voice is admired by the entire nation. After a few weeks of listening, there has been no response. We only see the leaders lying sick, with all the children thinking of themselves. Flattering the enemy to borrow money, and different claims are horrifying. The cries of the soldiers on the front lines and the wishes of the people are completely ignored. The government has isolated itself from the people. Why should the people put their hopes in the government? Since today, it has been either a military or a party state. The Republic is only in name. It is feared that after today, it will be either a communist or a co-managed state. The Republic is still nonexistent. Externally, we entrust our lives to the League of Nations, only to condone the enemy in undeclared war. Internally, we use the National Crisis Conference as a pretext to shift the responsibility to the trained people. Is this all for a nation with six thousand years of history and four hundred million people? In our humble opinion, there is no hope other than the self-awareness, self-action, and self-determination of our people. There is no hope for the current authorities other than being passive. The way for our people to take action is to immediately organize a National Representatives Assembly Promotion Association, and within the shortest period of time, have all provinces elect representatives to gather somewhere to convene a National Representatives Assembly. We must discuss and decide on the major policies of peace and war with Japan, and formulate a constitution. At the same time, we must demand that the Kuomintang return power to all the people. Anyone who is a citizen should be allowed to participate, regardless of party or faction, whether they are from the South or the North. We should only ask about their common views on this, and not count past grievances. Only in this way can we be worthy of a true Republic and a true Republic. The civil wars of the warlords, the control of one party, and the red and white mutual attacks of foreign enemies can be swept away. The transformation of the nation from weak to strong, and the transformation of the people from misfortune to happiness, all depend on this. The people are the foundation of the nation. We should not use it in times of danger and doubt. Human determination can overcome Heaven. Let us all fulfill our responsibilities. We respectfully ask for your advice.</p>
<h3>Three Important Telegrams from the Shanghai Citizens' Association</h3>
<p>▲ Commend and Encourage Members of the National Crisis Conference</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association issued three important telegrams based on the resolutions of the previous day, recorded as follows: (Telegram to the National Government) To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government: The National Crisis Conference has been officially ordered to be held on February 1st, and its members have also been announced by the Executive Yuan. At a time of national crisis, although the people have unlimited pain in their hearts, after shedding tears, the people have endless hopes and expectations for this conference. Whether the nation and the people live or die depends on this meeting. If the meeting is good, we will live. If the meeting is bad, we will die. The government must attach great importance to the convening of the National Crisis Conference. Do not use it as a tool for diverting blame or a source of advice. If the position is not respected, and the power is not great, the results of the National Crisis Conference will be no better than the National Economic Conference convened by the Ministry of Finance in June and July of the 17th year of the Republic of China. The people believe that the government should regard the status of the National Crisis Conference as equivalent to that of the government, and the powers of the National Crisis Conference should be equivalent to those of the National Assembly of a democratic country. The term of the National Crisis Conference should be at least two months. All resolutions passed by the government should be implemented, with at most one veto. Are these appropriate? We respectfully ask that they be adopted and implemented. Respectfully, the Shanghai Citizens' Association. (Telegram to the Members of the National Crisis Conference) To the members of the National Crisis Conference across the nation, sent to you by various newspapers: Having read the news that you have been appointed by the government as members of the National Crisis Conference, how can we not express our endless hopes and expectations amidst our sorrow? It has been twenty years since the founding of the Republic of China. What has been achieved? The nation is in trouble, and you have been asked to come up with solutions. How sad and painful are the people? You are the elders, politicians, lawyers, military leaders, diplomats, economists, educators, financiers, entrepreneurs, literary figures, and philosophers of the country, bringing together the best minds in one place. You will surely benefit the nation and the people. However, the people have something they must say. Since China is suffering from such a national crisis, the people should first bear the blame for their "neglect of national affairs." However, many of you should directly bear the responsibility. We hope that you will "forgive the past and pursue the future," and have the heart to "lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot." Immediately go to Beijing to participate in the meeting. First, respect the equal status with the National Government. Second, set the corresponding powers of the National Assembly. Third, the term of the meeting should be at least two months. Foreign affairs should aim to maintain national sovereignty and integrity. National defense should restructure the army that cannot resist foreign aggression into workers who manage rivers, build roads, and reclaim wasteland, and implement a compulsory military service system. The bureaucracy should impeach all corruption and create honest civil servants. Financial affairs should establish a budget and strive for frugality. Although you have served as officials and commanded troops, this conference is an organization of the people's will. You should speak for the people. Although you are invited by the government, you are different from officials. You should be regarded as if you were elected by the people. The survival and death of the Chinese nation are in your hands. We especially hope that you will not repeat the mistakes of the members of the National Assembly in the past. The people will be your backing and will also fulfill their supervisory responsibilities. Urgency does not allow for careful wording. Please understand. Respectfully, the Shanghai Citizens' Association. (Telegram to Compatriots Across the Nation) To all fellow countrymen across the nation, please be notified by various newspapers: The National Crisis Conference is scheduled to be held on February 1st in the capital. The members of the National Crisis Conference have also been announced by the Executive Yuan. It can be said that new and old are combined in one furnace, and thoughts and grievances are gathered in the same boat. In times of peace, we celebrate, but now in times of national crisis, we can only mourn. These one hundred and eighty-nine members hold the power over the survival and death of our nation and people. They should lower their status to be equal with the National Government. They should be given powers and responsibilities equivalent to those of a legislative body. The term of the conference should be lengthened to avoid the hasty completion of various conferences in the past four or five years. Moreover, many of the members bear the responsibility for "destroying national power" over the past twenty years. We hope that they will repent and reform themselves. On the one hand, our compatriots should be their support, and on the other hand, they should vigorously supervise them, so that the conference does not become a tool for diplomacy that will lead to the destruction of the country, or an organ that takes the blame for others. The national crisis is becoming more urgent. Please be aware. Respectfully, the Shanghai Citizens' Association.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the National Salvation Army Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>▲ Report on the Progress of the War Against Japan</p>
<p>Since its establishment at the beginning of this month, the Chinese National Salvation Army has gathered people's regiments and volunteer armies from outside the pass and converged in the Yixian area in the front line. They have fought against Japan. Now, the commander-in-chief of the army, Zhang Minli, has come to Shanghai to report to the central government and public groups in the city on the establishment of the army and the course of resisting the enemy. He also plans to recruit volunteer soldiers along the way to fight on the front lines. Mr. Zhang felt unwell and sent Mr. Zhang Shijing, representative of the Shanghai office, to Beijing yesterday to pay respects to Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, report on the war against Japan, and ask the government for its policy towards Japan. After his representative returns to Shanghai with a reliable report, he will prepare to leave Shanghai for the front lines. The report made by Mr. Zhang Minli when he received the news media is recorded below:</p>
<p>I am very grateful to the gentlemen of the news media in this city for coming today. The current national situation has reached a very dangerous point. Our government officials only know how to rely on the League of Nations, which is used by the great powers and imperialists to jointly dominate weak and small nations. They have watched us lose territory and armies, and allowed the Japanese invaders to run rampant everywhere. They are helpless. The hundreds of thousands of troops that we, the common people, have raised with our hard-earned money only know how to be brave in civil wars. When the Japanese invaders approach, they flee in the wind with a policy of non-resistance. This is truly a great humiliation for our great Chinese nation. The officials who scrape the people's wealth only care about their own interests. The life and death of the nation are irrelevant to them. Even if they give the entire Republic of China to Japan, they can still run overseas to enjoy a prosperous life. The pain of national subjugation is unfelt by them. The vast majority of our poor people will not only be subjected to the inhumane ravages of the Japanese, but our children and grandchildren will also be forever trapped in hell. Based on what I have recently witnessed in the two provinces, the tragic state of our compatriots who have lost their country is indescribable. Brothers, I feel that we now only have two paths to take. One is to shamelessly become a subjugated people of Japan, and the other is for the people to rise up on their own and resist Japan to the death. Except for a few shameless descendants who are willing to be subservient to foreigners, all the masters of our great Republic of China will never be so shameless. Therefore, we have resolutely taken the latter path, which is to resist Japan to the death. The comrades of the National Salvation Army are determined to fight to the end with an indomitable and desperate spirit. Now, I will briefly report to you on the progress of our work. (1) Organization process. In the recent two months, the people of the Northeast, seeing that the government was ignoring the loss of the Northeast, united themselves and implemented self-determination and self-rescue. For a time, volunteer armies arose everywhere. However, the volunteer armies lacked military experts to command them, lacked overall cohesion, and lacked effective communication. After prolonged fighting, they suffered huge sacrifices. Some volunteer armies supported Zhang Xueliang, while others opposed him. Their positions differed. Therefore, in addition to the name of the volunteer army, there was also the organization of the National Salvation Army. (2) Combat process. What I command is the National Salvation Army, with a total of about 77,000 people. Brothers first went out of the pass once and made arrangements. When Jinzhou was in danger, brothers went to the battlefield to command the killing of the enemy. Although I telegraphed and took the position of commander-in-chief of the National Salvation Army of the Republic of China on the 9th of this month, my troops have been fighting for several months and have repeatedly defeated strong enemies. A total of more than 1,100 Japanese bandits have been killed, seven cannons, more than twenty machine guns, and more than 700 rifles have been captured, and several enemy aircraft have been shot down. Our army commander, Ren Xiaobo, known as the Little White Dragon of war, has repeatedly tricked the enemy out of 200,000 yuan in enemy currency, more than 2,000 rifles, and countless military supplies. The Japanese bandits hated him to the bone. This time, in Gongzhutun and other places, we fought a bloody battle for more than 20 days. The Japanese bandits used dozens of aircraft to drop hundreds of 250-pound bombs. Ren's troops suffered more than 5,000 casualties, which was the most tragic and heroic bloody battle for our troops. This is a general overview of the progress of our repeated battles. (3) Current situation. Now, our army is divided and is fighting and attacking the Datong line and the Anfeng line due to the Japanese aircraft's rampant operations. We have been engaged in difficult battles. I will issue a limited-time announcement. However, I have seen that the bloody battles have been going on for a long time, and our equipment and ammunition are in short supply. Sacrifices are difficult to sustain. If we do not go to the government to ask for real assistance, it will become a tragic situation of putting all our eggs in one basket. In the middle of this month, I met a certain foreigner, a friend of Gou, at the Shijia Camp military camp in Yixian (due to diplomatic relations, his name cannot be announced). I left the Yixian military camp with him on the 16th, and arrived in Shanghai by sea on the 21st. Today, the Japanese are conspiring to disrupt Shanghai again. The government officials still have no definite solutions. We are extremely grieved. Brothers, I am here to receive news media colleagues, requesting assistance in two matters. (1) Urge the government to quickly provide assistance to our army and provide us with equipment and ammunition. (2) Awaken the people of the whole country and urge everyone to rise up and seek self-determination and self-rescue to strengthen our deterrent. However, brothers must solemnly declare that this time I left the pass to assemble troops and was determined to resist Japan to the death. As for the funding for our troops, we are generally self-sufficient. We would rather see wealthy families relieve the difficulties and never raise a cent from society or the government. If there are patriotic compatriots who are willing to sacrifice themselves for the country and are willing to go to the Northeast with their brothers to fight a bloody battle, it is what their brothers most desire.</p>

<p>I would also like to offer my blessings. Finally, brothers, on behalf of all the officers and men of the National Salvation Army, I would like to thank all of you gentlemen and respectfully wish you happiness.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Special Envoy Lei Zhen Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Report on the Conclusion of the Military Commission</p>
<p>The Guangdong Military Commission has been concluded, and Major General Lei Zhen, special envoy and advisor, is going to Beijing to pay respects to President Sun of the Executive Yuan, President Tang Shengzhi, and Commissioner Li Zongren to report on the conclusion of the commission. It is reported that Mr. Lei arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and is scheduled to go to Beijing within days.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of the Gunpowder Boat Explosion in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>▲Factory Director Song Returns to Shanghai from Beijing</p>
<p>▲Plans to Provide Generous Compensation to the Deceased</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, while the Gaochang Temple Arsenal was transporting gunpowder, an explosion occurred on the large, medium, and small vessels and two barges transporting gunpowder in the Huangpu River off the Beipiao Wharf in Rihui Hong Port. More than thirty crew members and workers were completely destroyed. Yesterday, the arsenal offered a reward to retrieve the bodies. Factory Director Song also arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning to handle the aftermath and ordered the Engineering Department to carefully budget for future safety measures for transportation. The various circumstances are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>▲Continuing Loading and Transportation After the accident at 3:35 PM the day before yesterday when the Dachung vessel had an accident at Longhua Bay while loading explosives to Pudong; the shock waves reverberated far and wide, and the smoke and miasma in Puxi were especially dangerous. However, the arsenal authorities considered it important for military preparedness to not stop the shipments. While handling relief efforts, they planned transportation to continue. At 6 p.m., the Songyun vessel towed a barge and continued to load explosives at the Pudong storage depot. However, the captain of the vessel, being overly cautious, dared not attempt it. Therefore, the barge loaded with one hundred boxes of black explosives was not towed by the Songyun vessel but instead, rowed by oarsmen, back to the West Fort Wharf to be unloaded for use by the factory.</p>
<p>▲Factory Director Rushes Back Factory Director Song Shi, had recently been summoned to Beijing by the Ordnance Department because of urgent military equipment needs. When the explosion occurred, the Engineering Department and General Affairs Department of the factory jointly sent an urgent telegram to the Nanjing Ordnance Department reporting the incident. The telegram read roughly: "To Director Chen of the Nanjing Ordnance Department and Director Song of the Shanghai Arsenal, today, while the Dachung vessel was towing the load to the factory from Pudong, an explosion occurred at Longhua Bay at 3:35 p.m., killing approximately thirty crew members and workers. A detailed report will be submitted after investigation. Engineering Department Liu, General Affairs Department Li, respectfully." Upon receiving the telegram, Song immediately took the night train from Beijing to Shanghai, arriving at 8 a.m. yesterday morning. He immediately went to the factory to investigate the incident and plan for the aftermath. He also believed that the cause of the accident, though due to the ignition of gunpowder, might also have been due to carelessness during transport. Yesterday, he specifically ordered the Engineering Department and the Inspection Department to carefully review and improve future transportation and installation procedures to prevent such unfortunate events from happening again.</p>
<p>▲Escaping Death When loading explosives, the factory assigned seven guard soldiers to escort the cargo. The day before yesterday afternoon, when the Songyun and Dachung vessels were loading, four guards were originally assigned. When the Dachung vessel left the shore from Pudong heading west, one of the guards, Sun Dexing, was supposed to be onboard, however, when he was untying the mooring rope, he did not have time to board the vessel, therefore, he remained at Pudong and did not perish. In the Longhua Bay bombing, the First Mate of the Dachung vessel, Kuai Xianfa, narrowly escaped. At the time, his injuries were severe, and blood was flowing backward, gushing out of his mouth. He was unconscious and was rushed to the Shanghai Hospital for emergency treatment. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the Red Cross Hospital on Haik Road. After surgery, his condition improved slightly, the bleeding stopped, and he could speak. His life did not seem to be in danger.</p>
<p>▲Handling the Aftermath After the incident, the factory immediately began investigating the number of deaths. Once the names were confirmed, a list was presented to the Ordnance Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, for generous compensation in accordance with the regulations for those who died in the line of duty. The temporary workers who were hired would also be compensated in the same manner as factory workers. Factory Director Song telegraphed the handling plan to the Ministry of Military Affairs at 5 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>▲List of the Deceased The names, ages, and positions of the employees who died tragically are investigated as follows: The Dachung vessel had a total of ten employees: Qian Runjin (chief engineer), Gu Yuesheng (second engineer), Wang Jinkun, Kuai Xianfa, Wei Asi, Cheng Defa, Yang Shoutian, Yuan Yicai, Wang Runda, etc. On that day, Cheng Defa and Yang Shoutian were on leave. Yuan Yicai had asked Gong Yanlin, a worker from the Mechanical Factory, to fill in. Except for Kuai Xianfa, who was seriously injured, all others died, and their bodies were missing. The two barges were hired by the deceased chief engineer of the Dachung vessel, Qian Runjin. About a dozen workers on the boats were killed. Their names could not be ascertained because Qian Runjin was dead. The temporary workers were hired by Liu Anfeng and Liu Ankui, the foremen of the small car service at No. 2, Lane 90, Jiangbian Road, Gaochang Temple, who specialized in supplying laborers to the arsenal. A total of eleven people were killed. Their bodies were searched for in the river by Liu Changxing and Li Youde, workers from the small car service, who were dispatched by the service at around 7 a.m. and hired sampans. Until 4 p.m., there was still no trace of them. The names of the eleven people are as follows: Li Youcai, Funing, 23 years old, lived in a thatched hut on Jiangbian Road; Lu Naichang, Funing, 27 years old, lived in a thatched hut on Jiangbian Road; Xia Qibi, Heicheng, 33 years old, lived at No. 95, Jiangbian Road; Wang Haiqing, Nanjing, 42 years old, lived at No. 2, Lane 90, Jiangbian Road; Peng Chunsheng, Lü City, 36 years old, lived at No. 2, Lane 90, Jiangbian Road; Wang Peiyuan, Anhui, 31 years old, lived at No. 3, Jiangbian Road; Wang Xidong, Anhui, 32 years old, lived at No. 3, Jiangbian Road; Liu Guoming, Gaoyou, 22 years old, lived in a thatched hut on Jiangbian Road; Wu Wenhong, Gaoyou, 23 years old, lived at No. 101, Zhuhu Road; Wang Xiucai, Gaoyou, 23 years old, lived at No. 42, Zhuhu Road; Wei Guanglou, Gaoyou, 30 years old, lived at No. 38, Zhuhu Road.</p>
<p>▲Reward for Retrieving Bodies The Navy Guard Camp's Wanhe vessel recovered the body of Wang Zhuangda, the cook of the Dachung vessel, the night before last. Yesterday, his relatives claimed the body. Yesterday, the arsenal requested assistance from the Navy Guard Camp, the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, the Arsenal Workers' Union, and the Municipal Health Bureau's Tongren Fuyuantang to retrieve the bodies, and offered a reward. If any local citizens retrieve the body of a victim of this incident, they will be rewarded with twenty silver dollars.</p>
<p>▲Union Compensation The Arsenal Workers' Union has accumulated compensation funds. When a member dies, whether in the line of duty or due to illness, a compensation of twenty dollars is given as a matter of routine. In this accident involving the Dachung vessel, the Union has already distributed the compensation to the families of the deceased. Additionally, they will request the factory to allow the surviving family members to fill positions at the factory. However, the temporary workers are especially poor, and their families, often with elderly and young, are weeping and petitioning the Union and the factory for compensation. It is said that the most tragic death was that of three generations of a family, all of whom were factory workers who died on the Dachung vessel, leaving behind many women with no means of livelihood, which is extremely tragic. Also, at about 8 a.m. yesterday morning, all the directors of the Union requested to meet with Factory Director Song to generously compensate the deceased employees. The factory agreed to forward the request to the Ministry of Military Affairs of the National Government.</p>
<h3>Austrian Consul Visits the Municipal Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Requests that personnel be sent to handle the aftermath of the accidental killing of an Austrian citizen</p>

The Garrison Headquarters has placed the soldier, Tang Chaofu, who shot Bausch, under guard, awaiting a military trial. The Austrian Consul, Winkler, specifically went to the Municipal Government yesterday to request that personnel be sent to the International Funeral Parlor to handle the aftermath.</p>
<h3>Special Maritime News</h3>
<p>▲Japan Increases New Ports</p>
<p>▲Developing Transportation to Manchuria and Mongolia</p>
<p>▲Japanese Ship Catches Fire En Route The Nikko Maru, belonging to the Japanese Mail Steamship Company, is a regular mail ship operating between Osaka and Qingdao. On the 22nd of this month, after departing from Qingdao and heading back to the Orient, when it was approaching Moji, a fire suddenly broke out in the ship's cargo hold. The shipowner, Hisakuba Masaaki, supervised the crew and sailors in an effort to extinguish the fire while telegraphing the head office to report. Yesterday, information was received here that the company has dispatched the rescue ship Nasu to the site of the accident to assist in the rescue. The extent of the losses is currently unknown.</p>
<p>▲American Ship Owner Still Not Safe The American businessman, Boughton, the owner of the second riverboat of the American Jiejiang Company, who was kidnapped by bandits at the Felt Hat Shoal upstream of Yuezhou, along with five sailors and passengers, has been held for a week. The ship has been towed to Yichang. As for the shipowner, passengers, and sailors who were kidnapped by the bandits, the bandits demanded a ransom of 200,000 yuan. Yesterday, according to a telegram received by the company, they are currently negotiating ransom procedures with the bandits. Because an agreement has not yet been reached, the shipowner and others have not been released. Also, the Yibin ship of the company ran aground upstream of Yuezhou. The hull has been wedged into the reef. The Qichun ship that was dispatched to tow the vessel has failed. Only a portion of the cargo has been transferred to Yichang.</p>
<p>▲Great Virtue Compensation Issues Since the accident of the Great Virtue vessel of the Da Da Company, the families of the passengers who were in distress have sent representatives Liu Shen, Chen Dexue, and Man Xue Li, and over twenty others, to Shanghai yesterday to seek compensation for the passengers who perished. The secretary of the company, Wang Songqiao, received them on behalf of the company, saying that there is no set precedent for compensation for passengers who die in accidents. The company can only provide appropriate assistance out of sympathy, but it is necessary to first investigate the actual situation of those in distress. After discussion, it was decided that the representatives should first submit evidence of the deceased for review in order to process the claims. ▲Japan Opens New Seaport Since Japan organized the plan for the puppet Manchukuo and Mongolia, regarding the completion of the Jihui Railway, Governor Ugaki and Railway Bureau Chief Omura of the country and the President of the South Manchuria Railway recently discussed merging a new seaport at both the terminal locations of Onggi and Chongjin, so as to connect it with Huining. Therefore, in the future, goods exported from Manchuria, Mongolia, North Korea, and the back of Japan can be transported to European and American countries from this seaport. The plan that the Korean Railway Bureau has been planning for a long time has finally achieved its desire to be realized today. The construction cost will require three to four million yuan. It is heard that the South Manchuria Railway will fill half of the expenses. After the new port is established, it will not only be convenient for commercial transportation, but it will also be very important militarily.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Businessmen and Citizens Fight for Legislation and Oversight of Elected Committee Members</h3>
<p>▲Special Telegram to the National Government Expressing Serious Concern</p>
<p>▲Please all Legal Entities Support Unanimously</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Road Business Community United Association and the Citizens' United Association, because the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan have not added popularly elected members according to the National Government Organization Law, telegraphed the National Government, expressing serious concern. At the same time, they telegraphed various legal entities, requesting unanimous support. The various telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Telegram to the National Government To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, it is noted that the current National Government Organization Law was promulgated and implemented on December 20th of last year. Your government has reorganized the five Yuan in accordance with the law, and the presidents and vice-presidents have also been appointed in accordance with the law. When a new law is implemented, the old law naturally becomes ineffective. Agencies created under the old law, if their organization conflicts with or does not comply with the new law, should also be abolished or reorganized. It is impossible to continue to exercise authority based on the old law that has become ineffective. The original members should not cling to their positions, using the unexpired terms of the old law as an excuse. According to the current National Government Organization Law, both the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan should have half of their members elected by the people. Before the popularly elected members are added, the organization of the two Yuan is fundamentally inconsistent with the law and cannot exercise the powers conferred by the law. The Legislative and Supervisory Yuan have the duty of creating and supervising laws, but if they themselves do not act in accordance with the law, how can they regulate the people with the law? We request that your government instruct the two Yuan to promptly reorganize in accordance with the law, so as to avoid the suspicion of violating the law and depriving the people of their legal rights. Furthermore, the National Government Organization Law is part of the fundamental law of the country, and only the highest authority can review it. The Legislative Yuan is a subordinate of the law, so how can it make any claims? We request that your government instruct them to correct this. For the sake of upholding the dignity of the nation's fundamental law, we dare not avoid offending. We beseech you to consider it. Shanghai All-Road Business Community United Association, respectfully.</p>
<p>▲Telegram to Various Legal Entities To the Shanghai China National Chamber of Commerce United Association, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Municipal Bankers' Association, Municipal Money Dealers' Association, Municipal Lawyers' Association, National Lawyers' Association, Shanghai Daily Press Association, regarding the matter that the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan have not been reorganized in accordance with the current National Government Organization Law and have not added popularly elected members, the telegram to Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government says (see above). It is noted that before the people obtain the addition of popularly elected representatives to the two Yuan, they all know what to fight for. Now that there is a National Government Organization Law with the same effect as the constitution, stipulating that half of the legislators and supervisors are elected by the people, it is puzzling that the Legislative Yuan, etc., are allowed to not immediately reorganize in accordance with the law and continue to exercise their powers according to the old law, without asking questions, and that the rights of the people conferred by the law are deprived without fighting. How can this not be strange? Your associations are all leading groups, and your legal knowledge should be much higher than that of our association. We respectfully request unanimous support. Sincerely praying for success, Shanghai All-Road Business Community United Association, respectfully.</p>
<p>▲Telegram from the Municipal Federation To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, it is noted that the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan should be instructed to promptly reorganize in accordance with the current National Government Organization Law, so that half of the people's representatives can immediately join as members, in order to protect the dignity of the law and show cooperation with the people. Shanghai Citizens' United Association, respectfully.</p>

<h3>Shui Qingan Tragically Murders His Own Infant Daughter</h3>
<p>▲Outraged by His Wife's Immorality, He Took Drastic Action</p>
<p>▲How Unfortunate That the Infant Daughter Died a Tragic Death</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a tragic incident occurred at No. 201 Dajing Road, Jiumudi, Nanshi, in which a father brutally murdered his own daughter with a knife. The detailed situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Two Young Daughters Shui Qingan, a native of Ningbo, is 36 years old. He has been working as a substitute waiter on various ships, so he has no fixed income. He married a woman named Shu, 31 years old, from Wujin. Shu married into the Shui family at the age of 26 and had two daughters: the elder, Jin Yuan, is 5 years old, and the younger, Jin Feng, is just 2 years old. The whole family lives in the three-story attic of a tiger stove at No. 201 Dajing Road, Jiumudi, Xiaobeimen, Nanshi.</p>
<p>▲Sudden Suspicion The other day, a certain ship departed from Shanghai to Hankou, lacking workers. Someone recruited Shui as a substitute. Shui initially wanted to go and had already obtained three yuan in wages. However, when the ship was about to depart, Shui suddenly refused to substitute, but Shu repeatedly urged him to go. Shui suddenly became suspicious and decided not to go.</p>
<p>▲Twice Scolded That night, the husband scolded upon returning home, and the scolding continued all night. The next morning, Shu went out to conduct her daily business of selling wood chips. That day, another ship needed a substitute, and Shui refused to go again. Until yesterday morning, Shui declared to Shu that she should return to Ningbo, her hometown, immediately, otherwise he would send her to the Jiliang Institute. A verbal dispute ensued again, almost leading to violence.</p>
<p>▲Murder of Infant Daughter Yesterday morning, Shu took her elder daughter, Jin Yuan, out. When she returned home after finishing her errands, it was around noon. As soon as she stepped into the door, the second landlord, Zhang Along, told Shu in a panicked manner that her daughter, Jin Feng, had just been murdered by her husband with a knife, and that if she rashly went upstairs, she would surely encounter misfortune. Shu was shocked and desperately sought help from patrol police Zhao Shichang and Tong Wenkui.</p>
<p>▲Husband's Paramour Upon hearing the news, Zhao and Tong rushed upstairs and arrested the murderer on the spot, along with the murder weapon, and took them to the second district, first precinct of the Chenxiangge Police Station. After Chief Xu personally interrogated them, Qingan confessed that his wife, Shu, had an affair with Chen Weisheng, a native of Ningbo, and that he had repeatedly warned her without success, and that she had repeatedly forced him to leave Shanghai, so he was extremely angry and killed his young daughter.</p>
<p>▲Husband's Violence Interrogated, Shu confessed that her husband was inherently violent and would beat her at every turn, which was unbearable. This time, he wanted to send her to the Jiliang Institute. She had no prior knowledge of his murder of their young daughter. Chief Xu, based on the confessions, considered the case to be a tragic murder of a daughter, which was a very serious matter. He would submit a report on Shui and Shu along with the murder weapon to the Judicial Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for review and the child's body would be reported to the court for examination.</p>
<h3>Municipal Library Postpones Opening</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Library has been under preparation for several months. It was originally planned to open on the 25th of this month. However, due to some books still needing to be sorted, it was unable to open as scheduled. However, over the past month, various organizers, after being appointed as members by the Municipal Education Bureau, and the library director, Zhuang Yun, took sick leave, so the directors and secretaries of each group urged the staff to actively organize the interior. Therefore, it is planned to resolve the various group projects within a possible range and complete them by a deadline, so that it can be officially opened as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Change of Director of the International Telegraph Bureau</h3>
<p>▲Wang Chongzhi Takes Over Within Days</p>
<p>Director Lu Guixiang of the International Telegraph Bureau has devoted his efforts to rectifying bureau affairs since taking office. He has now been ordered to be transferred. The successor is Wang Chongzhi. Wang is from Yushan, 34 years old, and graduated from the Electrical Engineering Department of Nanyang College with a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. He was formerly the Director of the Wireless Radio Management Office of the Construction Committee and the Director of the Public Works Bureau of the Qingdao Municipal Government. He is well-versed in both academic knowledge and experience. He is scheduled to take over the position in the next day or two.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Prices Slightly Increased</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has now approved the public bus company to increase the prices of routes 1, 2, 6, and 10, and has allowed the company to study the prices for three to four months before reporting to the Municipal Council. After the price increase, (A) Routes 2 (Edouard Road to Hongkou Park) and 10 (Avenue Petain to Linqing Road) will be changed to 20 copper coins during busy peak hours, an increase of 4 coins. Most of the passengers on these two routes are Chinese. It will be determined after the price increase whether they are willing to pay slightly more for a more comfortable ride. (B) Route 6 (Whangpoo Road to Hongkou Park) will be changed to a fixed price of 18 copper coins, an increase of 3 coins. (C) Route 1 (Jingan Temple to Hongkou Park) will be increased from 16 to 20 copper coins. All of the above changes are on a trial basis. When the Shanghai Municipal Council Superintendent sent a letter to the company, it stated that the Council was deeply concerned about the congestion experienced by passengers and hoped that the company's service would meet the needs. It hoped that the company would quickly add vehicles and put the new vehicles into operation as soon as possible, and that the company would put forth effort in its consideration of double-decker vehicles.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Seeks to Accommodate Beggars</h3>
<p>▲ Detailed plan drafted by the Bureau of Social Affairs</p>
<p>▲ Responsible for education and training to provide them with employment</p>
<p>Our city is a prosperous industrial and commercial area in the country, with a large population and a prevalence of beggars, causing considerable disturbance to residents. According to recent surveys, there are estimated to be more than 20,000 beggars in the Chinese, French, and Public Concessions. Considering the large number of beggars, the municipal government believes that failure to take measures to suppress them will have a detrimental impact on local security, sanitation, urban appearance, and international image. Furthermore, these beggars cannot be dealt with by law, so the only solution is to find ways to accommodate them and assign them to forced labor. Therefore, it has been decided that the Bureau of Social Affairs will formulate a detailed accommodation plan in the shortest possible time, and the municipal government will consult with the authorities of the Public and French Concessions to properly discuss ways to accommodate beggars, taking responsibility for education and training so that they can obtain suitable employment and avoid becoming beggars.</p>
<h3>### Major Theft Case on the Jinghu Railway Solved</h3>
<p>On the night of the 13th of this month, the 203rd train on the Jinghu Railway departed from Mackinnon Road Station. While passing Yangqi outside Huangdu Station, the guard noticed a dark shadow falling from the front of the train. At the time, due to the darkness of the night and the speed of the train, he could not see clearly. Upon arriving at Kunshan Station, the guard, Wang Fu, inspected the train and found that the door of car number 6433 was half-open, indicating a loss of goods. He immediately ran back along the track, searching along the way. Outside Yangqi Station in Huangdu, he found two bags of flour abandoned on the ground. He took them back and reported to the police chief of the section, Jian Huanjian. Jian Huanjian immediately telegraphed Jing Station to investigate and confirmed that a total of five bags of flour and three bundles of medicinal herbs had been stolen, with significant value. The police chief noted that recently, thieves had repeatedly climbed onto trains between Shanghai and Kunshan to steal goods, but the cases had not been solved, causing the thieves to become increasingly rampant. He believed that unless this case was solved and the perpetrators severely punished, it would not deter future thieves. Therefore, on the 20th of this month, he personally led three plainclothes officers to the Kunshan and Huangdu area, spending heavily to gather information along the way. He learned that in the sixth district of Jiading County, near the 25th lane, a resident named Zhou Jinsheng had been selling large bags of flour with unclear origins. Since the area was rural and he did not have an arrest warrant, and the officers were not in uniform, Jian Huanjian did not proceed with an arrest. Instead, he notified the local district office and requested that four armed police officers assist in the search of Zhou Jinsheng's home. During the search, the suspect and his wife were apprehended on the spot, and more than a hundred bags of stolen flour, as well as tools used for theft, were found in their home. According to the suspect's confession, he and his brother had stolen items from trains on numerous occasions, selling over four hundred bags of flour to nearby residents. At that time, the sixth district office refused to hand over the suspects because Jian and his officers did not have official documents and were not in uniform. Therefore, the suspects were temporarily detained at the district office. Jian Huanjian returned to the police station to prepare official documents and went to retrieve the suspects at 8:00 a.m. the next day. However, the sixth district office had already transferred the suspects to the Jiading County government. Jian Huanjian then met with the county magistrate to explain the situation and request the suspects' return for further investigation. However, the request was denied. The Jinghu Railway Police Headquarters plans to prepare another document and send officers to retrieve the suspects from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Housheng Cotton Mill Lawsuit</h3>
<p>▲ Bei Jiansheng and Li Dixian found not guilty</p>
<p>▲ Xue Gansheng's case partially dismissed</p>
<p>More than 3,000 workers from the Housheng Zi Ji Cotton Mill on Yangshupu's Lan Road elected representatives Ji Weishan, Le Haitang, Zhou Gaochen, and Pan Bingxiang, among others. They recently hired lawyers to file a criminal lawsuit against the mill's shareholders, Xue Gansheng and Bei Runsheng, and manager Li Dixian, for breach of trust and embezzlement in the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over the hearing in the No. 1 courtroom. The defendants hired lawyers Lu Shaozong and Li Zuyu to defend them, stating that Xue Gansheng had left Shanghai due to urgent matters and had gone to Hong Kong, with an uncertain return date. According to the plaintiffs' representatives, Ji Weishan and others, they were formerly workers at the Housheng Cotton Mill. The mill stopped work on December 21st of the previous year, promising to resume work on January 3rd. However, the reopening was indefinitely postponed. In October, the mill was taken over by others under a different name, causing the majority of the workers to lose their jobs. The relief funds they received were only six or seven yuan per person, an insufficient amount even for travel expenses back to their hometowns. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the lawsuit included civil claims, demanding 700,000 yuan in wages and 420,000 yuan in severance pay, as well as bonuses, for the period of the work stoppage. When questioned, Bei Runsheng stated that after the work stoppage that year, the mill's accounts showed significant losses, preventing the syndicate from providing funds for the mill to reopen on schedule. They had to close the mill and distribute the workers' savings. In June, the workers elected ten representatives to file a lawsuit with the French Concession Court. The case was later mediated, resulting in a total severance payment of 125,000 yuan. At that time, a person named Yuan handled the matter and published a notice in the newspaper. Lawyer Lu Shaozong presented newspapers and receipts from all 5,000 workers for receiving the money. Li Dixian stated that he was the former manager of the Housheng Mill. After the work stoppage, the mill syndicate did not have funds to reopen, so a notice was posted in late December of that year, distributing all the workers' savings as a sign of dissolution. Later, the workers filed a lawsuit in the French Concession Court, and the severance payment of 125,000 yuan was not handled by him. He only learned about it later through the foremen. Lawyer Lu Shaozong further stated that the workers were represented by lawyer Jiang Yiping at the time. He requested that Jiang be questioned in court to confirm this. Jiang Yiping testified that the workers elected ten representatives and hired him to file a lawsuit in the French Concession Court, resulting in a severance payment of 125,000 yuan. The ten representatives published a notice, and all the workers received the money, which was a fact. The court then instructed both sides to begin their arguments. Lawyers Lu and Li refuted the plaintiff's claims one by one. Judge Shen then announced the verdict in court: Bei Runsheng and Li Dixian were found not guilty, and the plaintiff's civil claims were dismissed. Xue Gansheng's portion of the case was not accepted.</p>

<h3>French Police Appeal Zhao Weixian Case</h3>
<p>▲ Person related to the Wei Tingrong kidnapping case</p>
<p>Wei Tingrong, the former commander of the Chinese Volunteer Corps in the French Concession, was kidnapped by bandits on July 24th of the 18th year of the Republic of China, on Zhu Bao San Road. The French police apprehended the perpetrators Chen Zhongheng, Zhu Jingcheng, and Tang Shiliang, who were interrogated by the former French Concession Court and sentenced to death. In August of the previous year, the French police apprehended key figures in the case, Shao Yuren, Lu Mingwang (from Pudong), Cai Weicai, and Zhao Weixian (Wei's brother-in-law, the current commander of the 6th Battalion of the Ministry of Finance's Tax Police Special Task Force). They were handed over to the Second Special District Court. The police prosecuted them for kidnapping under criminal law. After review by the presiding judge, Lu Mingwang was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Cai Weicai was sentenced to 20 years in prison. However, due to Zhao Weixian's status as an active-duty military officer, the court ruled that the public prosecution was inadmissible and transferred the case to military courts for trial. Dissatisfied with the verdict regarding Zhao Weixian, the French police filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court based on Article 2 and the attached note of the agreement between China and France regarding the establishment of Chinese courts after the recovery of the concession. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., Criminal Court Judge Guo Dezhang, along with Judges Zhang Chaozuo and Li Changnian, and Prosecutor Xie Zhijing, and Clerk Huang Lixiang, convened a hearing in the Second Courtroom. The court ordered that the appellant, Zhao Weixian, be brought to the stand. After questioning him about his age, place of origin, and occupation, the police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, gave a detailed account of the appellant's criminal actions and the police's disagreement with the first instance verdict, as well as Article 2 of the agreement between China and France regarding the establishment of Chinese courts after the recovery of the concession. Following this, the appellant's lawyers, including Jun Yuhua, defended him based on the Military Regulations of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and criminal procedure regulations. The court then announced the end of the debate and adjourned to deliberate the verdict.</p>

<h3>The Robbers Were Shocked When They Stepped Outside</h3>
<p>▲ Detectives were everywhere, and there was no escape</p>
<p>At around 10:00 a.m. the day before, three robbers, armed with weapons, broke into the home of Huang Mugui, resident of No. 1153 Hengji Lane, Gordon Road, under the pretext of asking for his surname. One robber stood guard at the entrance, while the other two entered the house. They pulled out handguns, demanding silence, and began to ransack the house, searching through boxes and cabinets. At that moment, Huang's wife seized the opportunity to sneak out the back door and saw a neighbor's maid, Su Fei, at the entrance. She secretly informed her of the situation. The maid then reported to the Gordon Road police station, and the police chief immediately dispatched Chinese detective Zhang Liang, police officer Liang Yuliang, as well as Western and Indian police officers numbered 138. They closed the lane entrance. The robber on lookout, seeing that something was wrong, took the opportunity to escape. The two robbers inside had already stolen 410 yuan in cash and silver, as well as silver ornaments. They happily carried the loot and attempted to escape, but were shocked to see detectives everywhere. They panicked and ran in all directions. Fearing that the robbers would resist arrest, the detectives fired a total of six shots, eventually apprehending both robbers. All the stolen goods were found on one of the robbers and taken back to the police station. The robbers were identified as Hu Xingsheng, from Pudong, who had a gunshot wound on his left arm, and Xia Tianjiu, from Jingjiang (the one with the stolen goods). The police chief ordered them to be detained and transferred to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, presented the details of the case, requesting a postponement for further investigation to determine if the defendants had committed other crimes. The recovered stolen goods were presented as evidence. The victim, Huang Mugui, also testified about the robbery and identified the two defendants as the robbers present at the scene. Hu and Xia's statements were evasive. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the evidence and ordered that they be detained for further interrogation in seven days.</p>
<h3>Two Organizations Request Reduction of Municipal General Tax</h3>
<p>▲ The City Chamber of Commerce writes to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, yesterday wrote to the Shanghai Concession Taxpayer Association, the letter states: On the 23rd of this month, Shanghai Special District City Residents United Association No. 91 letter was received, the letter was addressed to Shanghai Concession Taxpayer Association, and the Public Concession Bureau, to the effect that recent floods have occurred in various provinces, the violent Japanese are invading the Northeast, the world economy is in recession, and the Shanghai market is extremely depressed, resulting in a large number of unemployed people and an increase in risk-taking. If the tax burden is not reduced, this adverse situation will become increasingly serious. We respectfully request your association to forward this letter to the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau, requesting that the municipal tax be reduced by two percent from April 1st of this year, in order to alleviate the burden on taxpayers and maintain the prosperity of the market. This matter concerns public interests, so we respectfully request your association to advocate for this proposal. We have learned that citizens of our country who reside in the concession bear a heavier tax burden than those in the Chinese territory. Although we have repeatedly appealed for a reduction, it has been difficult to obtain approval. The people are truly unable to bear it. Recently, since the floods in various provinces, as well as the world economic recession, Shanghai has a direct and indirect connection. The depression in the market has become an undeniable fact. The request of the City Residents United Association to reduce the municipal general tax by two percent from April 1st of this year is the unanimous call of the citizens of the concession. We respectfully request your association to investigate and forward this information to the Public Works Department to strive for this reduction, in order to alleviate the burden on the citizens, we are deeply grateful.</p>
<p>▲ The City Federation writes to the Citizens' United Association Yesterday the Citizens United Association wrote to the Taxpayer Association saying: It is understood that residents and municipal organs are interdependent, and they share both prosperity and decline. If the municipal organs are insufficient, and the residents are sufficient, then they should do their best to make them sufficient. If the residents are insufficient, their source has dried up, and even if the municipal organs want to be sufficient, it is impossible. Since last year, Shanghai's business situation has been greatly affected by various adverse factors, and its prosperity has withered. The current situation of rampant bandits and the huge number of unemployed is due to very complex reasons, but the decline of industry and commerce is the biggest reason. If we do not urgently seek remedies, the downward trend will be unstoppable. As usual, under this situation, the municipal organs should allocate funds for relief, to nurture the tax source, but it is not enough to talk about it today. The only solution is to request the Public Works Department to adopt austerity policies, abolish the subsidy for the music team's exchange losses, stop the road widening plan, and change the first-class form of buildings to be built to the second-class form, use fewer foreigners and more Chinese. If this is the case, then about two million taels can be saved annually, and thus the municipal general tax can be reduced by two percent, so that the citizens can recuperate, and industry and commerce can return to prosperity, unemployment can be reduced, the bandits can be reduced, and the defense fee can also be reduced. There are many benefits, and the cause fee can be increased. We respectfully request your association to check and transfer to the Public Works Department for inspection and implementation, which is a public cause. Sincerely, This to (There is also a letter to the Chief of the Public Works Department, the text is omitted)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cotton Mills Decide to Close Down Completely</h3>
<p>▲ Actually trying to blame us</p>
<p>The Japanese-managed cotton mills in this port have been difficult to support due to the impact of the boycott of Japanese goods, so they held a meeting on the 23rd, and the majority opinion advocated a complete closure. However, because the consent of all parties was not obtained, they did not dare to implement it. Details have been reported in this newspaper. As of the day before, the Japanese cotton mill operators, having obtained the opinions of the Japanese Navy and the Consulate General, and after discussion by the directors at the Japanese Club, finally decided to close down completely. The date is within a week. It is said that they have telegraphed the Osaka branch, and the cotton mill operators in Osaka have also expressed their approval. At 4:30 p.m. on the 24th, the operators of the Japanese Cotton Spinning Association in China submitted a statement to the municipal government, stating: Our spinning operators, since the past five months, sales have been completely cut off, and products are piled up like mountains. Although we have repeatedly protested severely, the anti-Japanese atmosphere has not diminished. We are in a desperate situation. At that time, we were deeply afraid that if all the cotton mills closed down completely, the 60,000 unemployed workers and the more than 300,000 family members who depend on this for their livelihood would be on the verge of starvation, causing all kinds of disputes, so the industry has repeatedly endured and reluctantly maintained until now. If the Anti-Japanese Association is not immediately disbanded in the future, we plan to decisively close down within days, and all responsibility will be borne by the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Japanese Factory Strike Union</h3>
<p>▲ Jointly initiated organization with Jiahe</p>
<p>The strikes at the Xihe and Tongxing factories in West Shanghai have lasted for over half a month. However, the relationship between the two factories has not been adequately coordinated, preventing them from taking strict steps to deal with the Japanese capitalists. In view of this, the workers of the two factories held a joint meeting of representatives yesterday (25th) to discuss and decide to organize the Shanghai Japanese Factory Strike Union. Both parties signed a contract, expressing their serious intentions to the Japanese imperialist capitalists. The contents of the contract have been obtained as follows: The strike contract states that the Tongxing Cotton Mill No. 1 factory and the Xihe No. 1, 2, and 3 factories, in order to consolidate the spirit of worker unity and protect worker interests, have agreed that both parties must wait for satisfactory answers to the conditions before both parties can agree to resume work. If one party answers and one party does not answer, they must not agree, nor must they resume work. Or, if one party answers unsatisfactorily and one party answers satisfactorily, both parties must not agree, nor must they resume work. Violators will be treated as traitors to the workers, and the truth will be announced to the society, calling on all sectors to jointly condemn them. Each party will hold this as proof.</p>

<h3>Verdict in Gu Er'er's Child Loss Lawsuit</h3>
<p>▲ Xia Qiaolin partially exempted from prosecution for abduction</p>
<p>▲ Part of Ma Daxing's case dismissed due to improper jurisdiction</p>
<p>Hong Sheng, the four-year-old only son of Gu Er'er from Suzhou, who lived in the Xue Wanshun foreign iron shop on Huanghe Road in the French Concession, was abducted and sold by the kidnapper Xia Qiaolin in June of last year. The case was solved by the Jing'an Temple police station in the Public Concession, and the child was found. Gu learned of this and went to identify the child. However, the child had already been claimed by Ma Daxing, a Suzhou native living in Dehe Lane, Parker Road, and taken home. Xia was handed over to the First Special District Court by the police and sentenced to imprisonment after interrogation. Gu, whose child had been abducted and falsely claimed, hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation in the Second Special District Court, accusing Xia and Ma of abducting the child. Judge Xiong conducted a hearing some days ago, and both parties argued in court. The court concluded the debate and adjourned for a scheduled verdict, the details of which have been reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, the date of the verdict arrived, and both parties arrived at the court on time. At 2:00 p.m., Judge Xiong presided over the Criminal Court No. 1, ordering that Xia be brought to the court and the verdict be announced. The main text reads: Xia Qiaolin is exempted from prosecution for the part of the self-accusation by Gu Er'er for abduction. Ma Daxing's self-accusation of abduction is dismissed due to improper jurisdiction and transferred to the First Special District Court of Shanghai, Jiangsu Province for trial. After the verdict, the informant said that Xia Qiaolin had already been sentenced by the First Special District Court for his crime, and according to precedent, a case cannot be tried twice, so the court ruled for an exemption. Ma Daxing lives in the Public Concession, and now the court will transfer the case to the First Special District Court for trial, so you can wait for the summons. However, Gu did not understand the reasoning and waited outside the court with his wife, Ni, intending to make things difficult for Ma Daxing. The bailiffs stopped them, and with the persuasion of bystanders, the couple left in frustration.</p>
<h3>Fishing Boat in Distress Rescued</h3>
<p>Wu Zhennan, Director of the National Coast Guard of Wusong, said that recently, pirates have repeatedly gathered outside the port of Wusong, occupying the towns of Lvsi and Sanjia in Tongzhou, and their power is quite rampant. He has specially dispatched the Changfeng patrol ship to patrol the port every other day to deter them. At around 9:00 a.m. yesterday, Ding Wenqing, the owner of a Liyuan fishing boat, with a total of eight sailors on board, loaded water from this port and planned to sail to Shenjiamen to load fresh fish for sale to Wenzhou. However, after the boat left the port and sailed to the waters near the Dragon King Temple, the rudder suddenly broke. The boat immediately lost its steering ability. At that time, the sea was turbulent, and the boat body was tossed around in the sea, almost capsizing repeatedly, in great danger. The boat was also poorly equipped, with no whistle and no lifeboat. Boat owner Ding Fangqing and the sailors could only wait to die. At that moment, the Changfeng patrol ship was patrolling the waters outside the port and saw the boat in danger from a distance. It immediately sped forward and managed to rescue the boat from danger. It was towed back to Wusong for repairs at 1:00 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Murder and Robbery Suspects from Jingjiang</h3>
<p>Yu Mazi and Dai Dianzhang, from Jingjiang, committed serious crimes such as robbery and murder in their hometown and fled to Shanghai, hiding in houses No. 154 and No. 103 on Zhoujia Pailou, Yangshupu. Because Jingjiang officials arrested the robbers Zhu Guangfu and others, they confessed that Yu and Dai were accomplices. The Jingjiang County government sent judicial police officer Li Yuan to Shanghai the day before, petitioning the Yangshupu police station to assist in the arrest. The police chief signed an arrest warrant with the First Special District Court and sent detectives to arrest Yu and Dai. Yesterday morning, they were sent to Court No. 1. According to the police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, the police station did not object to the transfer of the two defendants. Judge Shen Bingrong interrogated them briefly and ordered that the two defendants, Yu Mazi and Dai Dianzhang, be handed over to the police from the Jingjiang County government for transfer.</p>
<h3>Customs Brokers to Convene National Representatives Conference</h3>
<p>▲ Discuss measures to oppose the management regulations</p>
<p>▲ The customs brokers in this city believe that the customs' announcement of the management regulations and the deadline for registration are too restrictive for both domestic and international shipping and their own business. They have repeatedly convened meetings of members to discuss countermeasures. At the same time, customs brokers in various places have also sent letters and telegrams expressing consistent steps and actively opposing the regulations. Yesterday morning, Shi Zhikun, Xu Youren, and Zheng Renye were sent to the Customs to meet with Tax Commissioner Robert to request the cancellation of the management regulations. Robert stated that the registration date could be extended to March 1st (originally February 4th), but the cancellation or modification of the articles could not be accommodated. The representatives then withdrew. It has now been decided to go to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Finance. If there is no result, a national representative conference of customs brokers will be convened to jointly discuss countermeasures. The incident may escalate.</p>
<h3>Examination of a Chinese Constable Killed by a Tram</h3>
<p>▲Zhang Xiu-fu's Body Claimed by Wife for Funeral Arrangements</p>
<p>Last night at 9:40 PM, Chinese Constable No. 3108, Zhang Xiu-fu from Huizhou, along with Chinese Constable No. 3095 from the Putuo Road police station, were walking north on the west side of Gordon Road when tram No. 215, driven by Wang Guozhen, suddenly struck Zhang Xiu-fu against a wooden utility pole. The impact was so severe that he died instantly. Constable No. 3095, witnessing the incident, immediately noted the tram number and reported it to the police station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate, and the body was taken to the Fielun Road morgue for examination. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Liu Chun, arrived at the morgue to conduct an official autopsy. Zhou Changgen and Lu Chunquan testified that there were few pedestrians on the road at the time and that the tram was traveling very fast. Wang Guozhen testified that he had been driving trams for over eleven years and that on that day, he saw a car approaching from the opposite direction and tried to avoid it.</p>
<p>At that time, the road was uneven, making it impossible to brake immediately. The front of the tram slid westward, hitting and killing the constable. After hearing the testimony, Prosecutor Guo concluded that Chinese Constable No. 3108, Zhang Xiu-fu, was indeed struck and killed by tram No. 215, and that the driver, Wang Guozhen, was suspected of a crime and should be prosecuted by the police and sent to court for handling. The body was released to the deceased’s wife, Zhang Li-shi, who signed a guarantee to take it back for coffin arrangements.</p>

<h3>Chinese Typewriter Amidst the Anti-Japanese Sentiment</h3>
<p>The inventor of the latest Chinese typewriter produced by the China Products Company is reportedly Mr. Yu 　qi from Taoyuan Township, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province. In 1930, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government approved its manufacture and reserved its patent. According to those familiar with the machine, it is exquisitely made and completely different from other typewriters. Since its release, it has gained a reputation for both quality and practicality. The China Post Office and major banks have adopted it and found it very satisfactory. Recently, the National Goods Factory Federation issued a certificate of invention, publicly recognizing it as an excellent domestic machine. Although malicious individuals have previously attempted to sabotage it, the raw materials, manufacturing, and distribution are all domestically sourced, and the evidence is conclusive. After a period of uncertainty, the facts have been clarified, and the promotion of the machine has received significant support. The manufacturing plant and general distributor are located at 141 Guizhou Road, Shanghai. There are no branch offices or authorized distributors in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Political Track to Stability</p>

<p>People’s Livelihood</p>
<p>........</p>
<p>Ms. Zhu Shuangyu</p>
<p>Hu Wenzhong once said, "The chaos in the world today lies not in powerful enemies, but in people's hearts. The difficulty is not in governing ignorant people, but in the literati's love of profit and forgetfulness of righteousness, and their impunity." Zeng Wenzheng also said, "The lack of soldiers is not a cause for deep worry; the lack of surplus is not a cause for weeping bitterly. But when I look around this world, seeking someone who does not rush to seize profits, who fears to lag behind in pursuing righteousness, whose loyalty and indignation burn brightly, I cannot find one easily. This is truly lamentable." Today, the state of people's hearts in China is worse by many times than it was when Hu and Zeng said these words. This is truly the most dangerous phenomenon in China. Why are people's hearts in China so bad? I believe that the fundamental problem is the instability of life. As for why life is unstable, that is due to the fact that politics is not on the right track. Because politics is not on the right track, there is favoritism everywhere. People are hired based on emotions, and layoffs are based on personal connections. As a result, those who work hard and diligently have no place to stand, and those who work hard have no guarantee. People only seek to grab a rice bowl, regardless of whether they are using their skills, and focus on enriching themselves, knowing that their tenure is only for a short time. Government officials are like this, so public affairs are naturally a mess. How can we talk about construction and improvement? When Li Hongzhang went to Maguan to negotiate peace with Japan, Ito Hirobumi told him, "It has been ten years since I last saw you, and your country has not changed at all in the past ten years, which has led to today." In fact, has China changed at all today? If there is any change, it is only that it has become worse. Therefore, not only can we not avenge our humiliation, but we are "adding humiliation upon humiliation." If politics were on the right track, public-minded and selfless, pragmatic and realistic, and people were used to their fullest potential, without the need for opportunistic advancement, and everyone devoted their skills to serving the public, why would there be no progress in our undertakings? If advancement and retreat were based on merit and not on emotions, and promotion and demotion were based on performance and not on personal connections, then people would not worry about gains and losses and would naturally focus on their work. How could they rush to seize profits and disregard their work? The stability of government officials' lives and their efforts in public service are essential for discussing psychological construction and material construction, and for discussing the reorganization of the economy, military, education, and culture. People often say, "To resist foreign aggression, we must first pacify the country; to defend against insults, we must first strengthen ourselves." These two sentences are self-evident and unbreakable. However, where should we begin to "pacify the country and strengthen ourselves"? I believe we should start with "putting politics on the right track to stabilize people's lives," because this is the fundamental task of pacifying the country and the prerequisite for strengthening ourselves. To save China from its hidden crises and the current catastrophe, we must first urge the government to work hard on this aspect. (B)</p>

<h3>Speech by the Commissioner of Education of Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>1.  Guarantee Excellent Directors</p>
<p>2.  Thoroughly Investigate Education Funds</p>
<p>Yesterday, Zhou Fohai, the Commissioner of Education of Jiangsu Province, made a public statement to reporters regarding the rectification of local education in Jiangsu. His words were quite important and are recorded below. Since taking office, I have observed that education in various counties has been stalled and ineffective due to frequent disputes. The main reasons for this are that the directors of education bureaus either find themselves in dire financial straits and unable to implement plans, or are entangled in endless lawsuits and unable to cope. They are only concerned with surviving from day to day and perfunctorily fulfilling their duties. Some even take leave or resign without waiting for approval, causing the office to devote most of its energy to resolving local disputes in a passive manner, leaving little time to focus on active plans and implementation. Such delays are unthinkable. In the future, I plan to vigorously rectify local education, but due to the accumulation of problems, it will not be possible to succeed in a short period of time. I plan to take the following two steps first:</p>
<p>3.  Guarantee Excellent Directors</p>
<p>4.  Thoroughly Investigate Education Funds</p>
<p>Recently, I have found that the number of education bureau directors accused of wrongdoing has reached more than 30. The files in the county offices are piled high, and officials are busy answering them all day long. Leaving aside the question of right and wrong for the time being, I have examined the documents and found that those using group names, such as "X Association" or "X Promotion Association," are questionable as to whether such groups exist or have been approved for registration. Those using private names often have dozens of signatures, all made by the same hand. Upon thorough investigation, not only are the allegations often based on insinuations, but the petitioners themselves are non-existent. The exchange of official documents has wasted much time, and has discouraged directors who wish to maintain their integrity from governing. I plan to issue a notice to the subordinates, stating that in the future, if local cases are reported, they should not be appealed above their level. All cases accusing school principals in the counties must first be handled by the education bureau, and cases accusing the bureau director must first be handled by the county government. If a decision cannot be made, the office will then review and make a decision. Those who do not comply with the order and report directly to the office will not receive a reply, so as to avoid wasting time and effort. The inspectors of the office will also frequently visit the counties to conduct investigations. If a director is fair, honest, and does not shirk his responsibilities, and has achieved excellent results, I will resolutely protect him according to the law, and will not be swayed by any accusations. I will also implement a system of rewarding those who work hard and punishing those who do not. However, if a director is found to be involved in corruption or is clearly incompetent, I will not only dismiss him from his post, but also punish him according to the law. This is the first point.</p>
<p>The local education funds in this province, according to recent statistics, have reached more than 12 million yuan. The counties with the most education funds have up to 500,000 or 600,000 yuan, but the more funds there are, the greater the disputes. Upon investigation, this is mostly due to the lack of strict supervision and assessment by the responsible authorities. As a result, budgets are expanded due to excessive increases, and education funds are short due to embezzlement. Funds are used to cover previous deficits, and funds are diverted from one purpose to another, reaching a state of exhaustion. If natural disasters and man-made calamities come together, the situation will become unmanageable. With more than 10 million yuan of local education funds collected annually in the province, and more than 4 million school-age children, less than 20 percent are enrolled in schools. The waste of public funds is so great, and the education of children is so small. It is heartbreaking to say. I plan to have the office establish strict measures for auditing the final accounts of education funds in each county, and to order all counties that have not yet established audit committees to establish them immediately, and those that have already established them must implement audits in a practical manner and not simply go through the motions. At the same time, regulations for assessing the performance of county magistrates and bureau directors in running schools will be implemented, so that local education funds can be thoroughly investigated, accumulated malpractices can be eliminated, and order can be gradually restored. This is the second point.</p>
<p>The above two points are only my occasional thoughts and reflections, and I think they may not be profound. However, the foundation of education depends on the local level. If the foundation is not solid, all facilities cannot be developed. In the future, I will devote myself to studying this issue and, if I gain any insights, I will ask for advice from colleagues in the education field. As for colleagues in the local education service, they should regard education as a sacred cause, not harbor factionalism, not indulge in personal opinions, and not harbor any hope of usurpation. In normal times, they must work together with education administrators in harmony. When finances are tight, they must share the burden of the times. Those who deliberately create difficulties and engage in endless litigation are a great obstacle to the future of education. This is what I sincerely hope from colleagues in the local education community.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Middle School Union Declaration</h3>
<p>▲ Tuition fees incurred a deficit of over 3 million this year</p>
<p>Teachers and staff have resigned en masse, and principals are also about to resign en masse.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Union declares, regarding the encroachment on education funds, that schools are on the verge of closure:</p>
<p>The advancement of education requires sufficient economic resources to develop, and its retreat requires a solid foundation to maintain. Comrades throughout the country and elders of the province, are you aware that the Jiangsu provincial education system is currently on the verge of collapse and is about to go bankrupt? The reason for this is the increasingly severe shortage of allocated funds and the forced continuation of burdens that should not be sustained. There has been no successful resolution for replenishing the increasingly short funds, and the Ministry of Finance has yet to implement it. Appropriate funds have already been planned for the burdens that should not be borne, but National Central University is willingly abandoning them. This prolonged dispute and incessant seizure, with National Central University straddling the national and provincial levels, benefiting from both sides without fear of advance or retreat, is like a chronic disease attached to the bones for Jiangsu province's schools, draining them without end. In the near future, they will be searching in a dry fish market. The current situation cannot be maintained, so how can the education system develop? We, as colleagues, personally witness and experience this precarious situation. Can we remain complacent and silent, without appealing to our national compatriots and provincial elders?</p>
<p>In terms of facts, when the cigarette tax was transferred to the central government in the past, it was agreed to offset it with the land tax. Any shortfall would be subsidized by the central government. As a result, the cigarette tax revenue has continued to increase, far exceeding previous levels. However, the land tax has been in deficit for years, reaching over 2.5 million yuan, without receiving a single cent of subsidy from the Ministry of Finance. In addition, the severe floods in the province last year led to a sharp decline in land tax revenue, and the slaughter tax revenue averaged only about 80%. After offsetting the accumulated deficits, the net income was only about 1.32 million yuan. Compared to expenditures, the shortfall reached a staggering 3.3 million yuan. As a result, the provincial education system is on the verge of collapse. In this difficult situation, it is still being asked to bear the annual cost of 1.32 million yuan for National Central University. To expect one family to provide when their own food supply is about to be cut off, and still want them to generously feed friends and relatives and assist neighbors, is simply unreasonable. What else can be said about forcing them to do so, other than wanting to cut off their lifeline and hasten their demise?</p>
<p>In terms of legal principles, Jiangsu province initially bore the annual cost of 1.32 million yuan for National Central University only because the slaughter tax had been included in the national treasury revenue. Since the slaughter tax was clearly designated as local revenue, the allocation of National Central University's funds from Jiangsu province has long lost its basis. Moreover, since the central government promulgated the trial budget regulations and budget revenue and expenditure classification standards for the 19th year of the Republic, what constitutes national revenue and what constitutes local revenue, what the national tax covers, and what the provincial tax covers, are as clear as the sun and stars, and are known to all. National Central University is "national" and "central" in name and function. Its funding should be provided by the national treasury, which is a matter of course. How can we allow confusion in the system and violation of laws, using provincial taxes to fund national schools? The Jiangsu provincial government recently made a righteous decision that from the 21st year of the Republic, the amount that National Central University used to take from Jiangsu province's education funds should be reallocated by the central government from the special cigarette tax collected in Jiangsu. This is in line with the national and provincial revenue and expenditure standards promulgated by the central government. Since the cigarette tax is a prosperous tax revenue, it would be better for National Central University to follow the precedent of Wuhan University and rely entirely on the special cigarette tax, which is both legal and stable. Why not be happy to do so? However, the Executive Yuan recently abandoned the budget regulations and revenue and expenditure standards promulgated by the national government and decided that Jiangsu province should bear 1.32 million yuan of National Central University's funding, adding the word "permanently," without knowing what legal basis it has. If this decision is implemented, it would be equivalent to changing the law by order, starting with the Executive Yuan. From then on, would there be anyone in the country who abides by the law?</p>
<p>In conclusion, National Central University is abandoning the legal and calculable special cigarette tax and clinging to the heavily indebted Jiangsu province's education funds, determined to cause mutual harm and perish together with Jiangsu province's education. Even if this is what National Central University wants, it is not what Jiangsu province's education colleagues want, and it is even less what the elders of the province and the compatriots of the country allow. The facts are all there, and the legal principles are clear. What is right and what is wrong should be judged by public opinion. Currently, all teachers and staff of secondary schools in the province have jointly submitted their resignations to the principals because of this matter. The principals are earnestly trying to persuade the teachers and staff to stay, while taking responsibility to appeal to all parties and strive for a resolution. If there is no hope of a solution, the principals will have no choice but to take responsibility and resign, respectfully yielding to those with greater ability. This is what we must pre-emptively present to our national compatriots and provincial elders. At a time when foreign aggression is rampant and the national crisis is imminent, the whole country, from top to bottom, does not know how to unite against external enemies and work together for survival. The education system, which is related to the national lifeline, and education funds are not being handled fairly. Instead, they are constantly provoking and hindering each other. Brothers and colleagues believe this is extremely painful and shameful. Especially when national policies are uncertain and discipline is lax, emotions prevail, and actions often cross the line, relying on power and taking advantage of the crowd is considered normal, and surrounding and demonstrating are not considered strange. If young people are not restrained, how can middle-aged people follow suit? We, as colleagues, bear the responsibility of education and are always mindful of our role as teachers. The trend of the times and the social atmosphere are closely related, so we dare not benefit ourselves at the expense of others, and even more dare not forget righteousness for the sake of profit. We vow to uphold the principles of morality and law, and protect the foundation of our nation's survival and prosperity. We encourage ourselves with this and teach with this. Gentlemen of the country, please take note.</p>

<h3>Middle School Union Delegation Petitions the City Government and Garrison Headquarters Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Yu Hongjun responded to various points of inquiry</p>
<p>▲ Commander Dai was away on official business and sent representatives to meet with them</p>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Union considers the arson and murder incidents by Japanese ruffians in western Shanghai to be of great importance to the overall security of Shanghai. After a resolution by the Representative Assembly to petition the municipal government and the Garrison Headquarters, it specially dispatched representatives from over twenty schools, including Modern, Anhui, Daxia, Qixiu, Shanghai Middle School, Fudan Experimental Middle School, Pudong, Qingxin, Jingye, Wusong, Patriotic, Zhi Ren Yong, Xinmin, Huiling, and Zhu Zhang, yesterday. It also elected Zhang Chengxiu from Daxia, Ding Dezhao from Huiling, Xiao Sizhi from Pudong, Yang Xikun from Shanghai Middle School, and Gui Xinyi from Xinmin as the presidium. At around 11:00 AM, they gathered in the City Hall reception room, and the situation was quite tense. The Public Security Bureau specially dispatched Captain Huang Ming and over ten guards to maintain order. After Secretary-General Yu of the City Hall responded to each inquiry, they went to the Longhua Garrison Headquarters in the afternoon at 2:00 PM to petition. The following is a detailed record of the response process by a Shanghai News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>▲ Petition to the City Government: The petition delegation gathered in the City Hall reception room, where Secretary-General Yu met with them. He said that Mayor Wu was out on official business to plan for security issues and that everyone's patriotic sincerity was admirable. If there were any inquiries, he would answer them one by one, and the City Hall would sincerely accept all criticisms. First, Xiao Sizhi, the representative of Pudong, raised several questions and requests to the City Hall as follows: (A) Questions: (1) The City Hall is the highest administrative body in Shanghai. How can the City Hall not be held responsible for the security after the arson and murder incidents by Japanese ruffians in western Shanghai? (Answer) The City Hall is very sorry to the citizens for this unfortunate event. Because the city's police force is weak and was not fully prepared in advance, the City Hall, as the highest administrative body, should be held responsible for security. As for the military and police, there should be adequate preparations now, but the security plan involves military secrets and cannot be announced. (2) Why was there no defense in advance? (Answer) The City Hall's allocation of police officers is proportional to the population density. The Yinxiang district is remote, and there was no prior knowledge of this unfortunate event, so it was impossible to have a large number of police officers stationed there. (3) Why did the City Hall not file a serious protest against this major event? (Answer) A serious written protest has already been filed. (B) Requests: (1) Request the release of the arrested compatriots. (Answer) This will be carefully judged by the court. If they are found innocent, they will be released immediately. (2) Provide assistance to the striking workers of Tongxing. (Answer) The responsible bureau (Social Affairs Bureau) will be instructed to handle it properly and arrange for accommodation in Chinese factories. (Request for compensation to the victims. (Answer) If the trade union reports the suffering of the victims to the City Hall, they will find ways to provide compensation. The City Hall will also ask the Shanghai Municipal Council to provide compensation for the killed Chinese police officers. He also said that the events requested by everyone will be handled promptly, and the progress will be reported to everyone this Wednesday (i.e., tomorrow). It is still difficult to predict whether everyone will be satisfied, but he greatly admired everyone's enthusiastic patriotic spirit this time. After Secretary-General Yu responded to each inquiry, the representatives immediately went to:</p>
<p>▲ Petition to the Garrison Headquarters: Commander Dai was running around all day for the security issues in the Chinese areas of Zhabei, Wusong, and Caojiadu. When the representatives arrived at the headquarters, Commander Dai was out. Secretary Xu Yiheng and General Duty Officer Zheng Youyou met with them. According to the response, at this critical moment of national crisis, the people of the country should all engage in practical national salvation work. Since we are members of the country, who can not take responsibility for national salvation? The headquarters already has a practical plan regarding the city's military security, but this concerns military secrets and cannot be announced. The headquarters is responsible for defending the territory and will take practical responsibility for military security, and will never hold a policy of non-resistance. If you have any other questions, if we cannot answer them, we will convey them to our superiors. Because of the time constraints, the representatives did not have the opportunity to meet with Commander Dai and the Staff Office and left.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association's Zhizhi Team Defeats Jianhua</h3>
<p>▲ Result: 52 to 38</p>
<p>││ No Group A Games Tonight ││</p>
<p>The Zhizhi basketball team's spirits remain high since Kong and Xia rejoined, and their coordination and shooting accuracy are unmatched by other teams. Yesterday's game against Jianhua saw Zhizhi win with a score of 52 to 38. Both teams put on a good show. The two Group B games were also worth watching in terms of skill. (1) Qingxin defeated Quanguang. The score was 7 to 6 in the first half, and the final score was 21 to 13. (2) [Blank] Team defeated Red Team, 29 to 23. The Red Team led 15 to 12 in the first half. The following is a detailed account of the Group A game:</p>
<p>▲ Zhizhi Got a Scare: When Zhizhi and Jianhua first met, Jianhua was in high spirits and quickly took the lead with a score of 14 to 4. Zhizhi got a scare and quickly caught up. The momentum gradually shifted, with three shots in the middle, and the situation became tense. After a long stalemate, Yang Linyu added another point. In the blink of an eye, Zhizhi tied the score at 16 to 16. Qian Dingshen added two more points, and Zhizhi took the lead with a score of 18 to 16. From then on, they had smooth sailing, and every long-range shot and close-range shot hit the target. At the end of the first half, Zhizhi won with a score of 27 to 18. ▲ Jianhua Declined: When the second half started, Zhizhi was in even better form. The defense was solid, and the offense was sharp and unparalleled. Coupled with their close unity and beautiful coordination, Jianhua was not weak, but they lacked special performances. Dong Xiaopei was the most outstanding player on the team. The defense was ultimately not solid enough, so they were often countered by the opponent. Zhizhi made repeated gains, and Jianhua lost more than they gained. The score difference was as high as 16 points at one point. In the end, Zhizhi won with a score of 52 to 38.</p>

<p>The County Magistrate's Qualifications (Part 1)</p>
<p>When Li Jun Jin Fang, the former county magistrate of Liyang, declared that he would give up his qualifications as a county magistrate in the second Jiangsu Provincial Examination, he added: "As for the qualifications as a county magistrate obtained in the Hubei Political Affairs Committee examination in the past, although they are useless, I am willing to keep them." Since he already knows that these qualifications are useless, why not throw them into the wastepaper basket sooner? The reason why Mr. Li is reluctant to give up his Hubei county magistrate qualifications is probably because he has not completely seen through things like diplomas and qualifications.</p>
<p>I can say that the county magistrate qualification diploma is not reliable, not only the one from Jiangsu, but also the one from Hubei. Not only is the one from Hubei unreliable, but even the ones personally tested by the President of the Examination Yuan are unreliable.</p>
<p>Why is this so? The county magistrate examination, judging from the ones that have already been held, has both a written test and an oral test. The written test is to test writing skills, and the oral test is to test speaking skills. A person who can write well and speak well will not necessarily be a good county magistrate. Some people say that the moral character of a person can be seen from his appearance and demeanor during the oral test. In this case, wouldn't the examiner also be a fortune teller? I used to use oral tests to recruit new students. More than ten years of experience tell me that it is impossible to judge true talent based on appearance and speech. The oral test is as unreliable as the written test, and the score does not represent a person's true ability.</p>
<p>Dai Jun Fuxian requested punishment for himself because a candidate's examination score was miscalculated. I criticized the examination method at the time, saying, "I'm afraid that all the scores from the Examination Yuan are miscalculated." If you reissue the examination papers from the first examination by the Examination Yuan to the original graders and ask them to regrade them, comparing the later grades with the previous grades will provide strong proof for my hypothesis.</p>
<h3>Record of Lamenting the Fall of Korea</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>In the vastness of the Yellow Sea lies a peninsula, known as Korea. The character "朝" (chao) should be pronounced "zhao," not "chao" as commonly mispronounced. It signifies the fresh and brilliant appearance of the rising sun. Its people are descendants of Jizi, and it had long been a tributary state of our country. However, during the late Qing Dynasty, the Japanese invaders harbored covetous intentions, leading to the Sino-Japanese War. The Russo-Japanese War also originated from disputes over Korea. The Japanese cleverly crafted justifications for the annexation of Korea. In a communication to the Chinese envoy, their foreign ministry stated: "We have discovered that the King of Korea frequently harbors secret schemes, resulting in disturbances and causing great harm to our nation. Furthermore, his capacity for self-governance is too weak to shoulder significant responsibilities. Our relationship with Korea extends beyond mere trade. Due to our geographical proximity, we are obligated to intervene in affairs beyond our borders. Our nation cannot stand idly by and risk our reputation. Therefore, we have resolved to take action to ensure peace and stability." The cunning of the Japanese is evident here. However, the Korean people, deeply influenced by the civilization of our country, and having lost their reliance on China, suffered greatly under Japanese oppression. Consequently, an anti-Japanese movement emerged. Gatherings and speeches were held around the Bell and Drum Tower and Tiandong areas outside the West Gate of Seoul, organized by patriotic youth associations such as the Security Association, the Independence Club, the National Prosperity Association, and the One Heart Society. Among them, a few small anecdotes are worthy of song and tears, and should not be forgotten. Li Bingru, a student at Peifang School, funded the needs of patriotic volunteers with his own resources. The Japanese police discovered this, seized his family's property, and left him destitute. Bingru became impoverished and unable to survive, and he was closely monitored, with no one daring to help him. He eventually died of cold and starvation. In his dying moments, he repeatedly shouted "Long live Korea!" His voice was tragic and horrifying, sending shivers down one's spine. Furthermore, a noblewoman, after the fall of her country, changed her name and traveled to Japan, enrolling in a music school. She deliberately became a courtesan singing "Flowers in the Backyard," to ingratiate herself with Japanese Prime Minister Ito. Ito, known for his fondness for women and nicknamed the "Peony Prime Minister," took her as his concubine. Later, when Ito went to Korea and arrived at Harbin, Ahn Jung-geun ambushed him at the train station. It was the woman who secretly informed Ahn of Ito's itinerary. Ahn was arrested and executed heroically. A Korean named Kim Taek-ung wrote a poem to express his joy: "The brave man of Pyeong'an glares with both eyes wide, Killing the national enemy is like slaughtering a sheep. Glad to hear the good news before death, I sing wildly and dance with a chrysanthemum cup. In the port of Vladivostok, dust sweeps the sky, A thunderbolt strikes in Harbin. How many heroes from the six provinces, Suddenly drop their chopsticks in dismay." His righteous indignation is evident in these words. Koreans have always had many talented poets. Moreover, a certain patriot, unable to bear witnessing the tragedy of his country's demise, left his homeland and sailed overseas. His poem upon leaving his country reads: "I want to cry but cannot cry, I want to go but cannot bear to go. Heaven and earth are filled with tears,</p>
<p>There is nowhere to find the Qin court." It is desolate and sorrowful, unbearable to finish reading. The fall of Korea is a warning to our country. Writing this by the flickering lamp, the sound of the wind outside the window is like the weeping of ghosts and heroes. I throw down my pen and sigh three times.</p>

<p>The World's Largest Reservoir: The Littleton Reservoir located outside London, England, is considered the largest artificial body of water in the world. Its perimeter covers four and a half acres. The water within can accommodate an entire fleet of ships at anchor.</p>
<p>▲ Sixteen-Year-Old Bride and Groom: According to British marriage statistics from 1931, there were 22 grooms aged 16, while there were 699 brides of the same age. The age of marriage has been decreasing in recent years, and it is possible that men and women under the age of 16 may marry in the future.</p>

<p>▲ Wireless Radio Expenses: Entertainment via wireless radio is popular around the world, as common as the gramophone. In 1931 alone, the cost of radio entertainment amounted to approximately 25 million British pounds.</p>
<h3>Record of the National Goods and Anti-Japanese Goods Circulation Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>It has been four months since the Mukden Incident. Throughout our country, from the government to the common people, everyone is filled with righteous indignation and yearns for revenge. Among the efforts to resist Japan and save the country, boycotting Japanese goods is the most effective strategy to defeat the enemy. People from all walks of life have worked together, and in the past few months, they have achieved remarkable results, placing the Japanese in a position of economic decline. There are generally two strategies used by the Chinese people to promote boycotting Japanese goods. One is to hold national goods exhibitions, displaying local products to the public, so that everyone can happily use and benefit from them. The other is to hold exhibitions of inferior goods, gathering all the daily necessities that Chinese people often buy from Japan in one room, so that everyone recognizes them as enemy goods and then abandons them. The methods adopted by these two strategies are not entirely the same, but the underlying meaning is the same. Recently, while working in Nanxiang, I saw that the Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association of the National Tongji University held a comparative exhibition of circulating national goods and enemy goods. Combining the two strategies mentioned above and making comparisons, it is even more ingenious and thought-provoking. The exhibition was displayed at the Nanxiang Central Primary School and divided into two rooms. After signing in, visitors could enter and view the exhibits. The first room displayed national goods, including school supplies, serge, cloth, toys, porcelain bottles, daily necessities, etc. Each product had a label, which listed the product name, manufacturer, manufacturer's address, and value, etc. They strove for detail and showed a sincere effort to promote national goods. After walking around the room, we learned that products such as serge and woolen cloth, which ordinary people often thought were imported, can now be produced by the Chinese themselves. We couldn't help but sigh at the progress of the industrial sector in recent years, and those of us who bear the responsibility of promotion should make further research. Then we entered the second room. On the four walls of the room, large slogans such as "Don't Buy Oriental Goods" and the merits of rejecting Japanese goods imports were written. The names of Japanese merchant houses and their products were listed in detail without omission. The Japanese goods on display were mostly daily necessities, followed by silk and cloth, and food also accounted for a portion. In addition, fifty photographs of the Northeast Incident were collected and publicly displayed, with explanations attached. The staff of the association also earnestly persuaded visitors to have the determination to love national goods and reject Japanese goods. Their enthusiasm was admirable. It is said that the exhibition has been held in Shanghai and Baoshan</p>
<h3>Northern Travel Images and Others (7)</h3>
<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>▲ Autobiography of Movie Star Hu Die</p>
<p>"Student days," this lovely term, has now become a nostalgic yearning for me. I also walked along the streets of Beiping with a schoolbag. I still remember the fashion of female students in Beiping during my student days, walking with a somewhat shy expression and lowered head, as if they had been swept away by the wheels of time. Everything I saw this time was obviously much more lively. Their bicycles often followed our actions, and they seemed more interested in our work than we were. Often, every night, I could hear many clear female voices over the phone, inquiring about the location of our work the next day. Some people brought my existing photos and asked me to sign them as a souvenir. Some people brought the book "Tears and Smiles" to talk to me about the filming. Naturally, I should feel</p>
<p>disappointed in myself. Why did my student days only give me such small memories? ▲ Enthusiastic Crowds of course, it was not only the female students of Beiping who gave us considerable encouragement. During our work, we really could not avoid the encirclement of crowds. They seemed to know more about the plot in this film than we did. Often, before our performance even started, they could predict what scene we were going to perform. Later, when we were shooting three other films, they could also tell that it was not "Tears and Smiles." From this,</p>
<p>it can be proved that they were familiar with the stories of He Lina, Shen Fengxi, Guan Xiugu, and Fan Jiashu. ▲ Sound and Color Our work is not only for "Tears and Smiles," but also for three other films that are being shot at the same time. My work is certainly much more burdensome, but also much more interesting, because in terms of film production, it is obviously very different from shooting "Red Tears" and "Such a Paradise" in Shanghai: The "Sida Tong" sound machine captures the clearest sound for us, and the "Beautiful Color" color camera gives us the most natural scenes. We rely on the wonders of science to give our work two of the most realistic and satisfying guarantees. I thought of the few cries of "Sister Xiang" in "The Singing Girl Red Peony," and I also thought of the few floating "Red Clouds" in "Red Lotus Temple." There should be even better success in the future!</p>
<p>once. Now I have come to Xiang again, and perhaps I will go elsewhere soon. Therefore, it is called the Circulation Exhibition, in order to arouse the interest of the majority of the people. According to someone, the meaning of our creation of a comparative exhibition is twofold. One is to make the people of the country understand the progress of national goods in recent years. For everything that Japanese goods have, we almost have too. On the one hand, to make the people of the country understand the inside story of Japanese goods, so that they know what to choose when buying, and not get confused. It is a pity that the time is short and the collection is not extensive. It is planned to gradually increase it in the future. After the visit, the association asked for criticisms in writing. I casually wrote, "Doing practical publicity work is ten thousand times better than empty slogans." This was also inspired by my feelings.</p>
<h3>A Dream</h3>
<p>— Mingfei</p>
<p>I suddenly dreamed of my friend Zhuowu in the middle of the night. Alas, I have been hoping for the return of my Zhuowu every day. It has been more than ten days now. Zhuowu left Shanghai for Fu on December 12th. On the 13th, at noon, the ship caught fire while traveling to Qiwangsha. Zhuowu has been missing ever since. The weather is cold and the sea is wide. Is Zhuowu still alive? His mother is old and his children are young. Is Zhuowu really dead? I cannot help but despair, but I cannot bear to despair. Now can I only see him in my dreams? Alas, what should I think of Zhuowu's trip? He was going to Jiangbei to provide winter relief and attend the funeral of his friend Ma Shuzhi, along with his aunt and friend Ge Xudong and a young maid. When the fire broke out, a couple surnamed Yu from his hometown desperately begged for help. Zhuowu led them to the rudder, gave them floating devices, and lowered the little maid into the water. He was so calm. Now the Yu couple have been rescued from the water. The body of his aunt was also</p>
<p>found on the beach in Changshu County (Ge's body has also been found). But whether Zhuowu is alive or dead is still unknown. My heart is hanging in the balance, that is why I am dreaming. My life is full of poverty and sorrow. Zhuowu told people that Mingfei is desolate and unfortunate, and he suspects that he will die mad, like Xu Wenchang. Alas, my parents gave me life, and Bo Ya knew me. Where has Zhuowu gone? December 28, 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>Correction: In the article "Mud Emperor" the other day, the word "百" (hundred) in "夏間從湘中覓得百年前丹砂" (I found cinnabar from Hunan in the summer that was a hundred years old) was mistakenly written. It should have been the word "四" (four). This is to be corrected.</p>
<h3>Record of Rongma Shuanglou (12)</h3>
<p>— The Owner of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Three: Yu and Liang Arrive Together, Causing the Feast to Disperse; Lord and Prime Minister Avoid Each Other, Unsure Who Left the Box. However, an actor has a kind of nervous and uneasy psychological state before going on stage to perform. An Yutian was in this state of fear and trepidation. Suddenly, it was as if he had a heart attack. He stood there blankly, unaware, unhearing, and unseeing. Later, Liang Xiaoyun finished her work, and vaguely had the thought that a woman pleases herself. She turned her face and smiled at him, wanting to ask if the powder on her face had been applied evenly. But she saw that his eyes were straight, as if his soul had already left his body. This, on the contrary, startled Liang Xiaoyun. She quickly put down the golden box and walked over.</p>
<p>She patted him on the shoulder and said, "Hey, why are you spacing out again? I think you've been too stressed lately and your brain has been seriously injured. Don't turn into a mental case. Although I'm leaving now, I'm really worried about you. When that guest of yours comes, I advise you to go to bed early and stop thinking wildly and worrying so much. Take care of your precious body. Now you're the only one left in your family. If you don't take care of yourself, it makes me so sad to see it." An Yutian was awakened from his dream by this pat. He shook his head and replied, "Nothing's wrong. Please leave without worry." Liang Xiaoyun straightened her clothes and touched the handbag again. She looked at An Yutian and said, "It's getting late. Your guest is probably coming soon. I'm going back now. I'll be waiting for you at home tomorrow. You have to come. I'm telling you seriously. Don't be so worried. No matter what big things happen, try to think it through. If you're willing to discuss it with me, I think there's a solution for everything. When you come to me tomorrow, I'll talk to you in detail. Do you remember?" As she spoke, she walked out of the room. An Yutian also walked shoulder to shoulder</p>
<p>to see her off. On the way, he agreed to all the tender words she painstakingly told him, showing his heartfelt acceptance. He escorted her all the way to the gate, helped her into the car, and gave her some more instructions before finally saying goodbye. Here, An Yutian waited on the stone steps outside the gate until her car drove away. The buckets hanging up and down in his chest seemed to have all calmed down. He couldn't help but heave a heavy sigh of relief and secretly said, "What a close call." But he was lucky after all. Li Wenxia didn't happen to come and run into them. Now it doesn't matter anymore. All his worries disappeared and he felt light all over. On the way back to the room, his footsteps were much more agile. When he got back to the room and took another look, the table was a mess of cups and plates. He had just forgotten to tell someone to clear the table. He expected Li Wenxia to arrive soon. If she saw these leftovers, she would inevitably ask questions. If he didn't answer properly, there would still be some entanglements. So he called the tea room and ordered him to quickly clear away the dishes. Who knew that just as they were clearing half of it away, there was the sound of high-heeled leather shoes tapping on the floor outside the room. .</p>

<h3>Financial Spot Gold Rebounds and Rises</h3>
<p>▲ After Consecutive Declines: Yesterday, it Rebounded by Six Taels and Six Mace</p>
<p>▲ Gold Market Fluctuations Unpredictable: The spot gold market situation on the 25th was quite chaotic, like a stormy sea, the momentum was unstoppable and the changes were unpredictable. The daily high and low points had a difference of fourteen taels. People in the industry were confused and could not decide what to do. In the end, it rebounded by more than six taels, which was a reversal of the consecutive days of decline. The morning opened high, indeed because the silver market suddenly fell unexpectedly the day before. With righteous courage, it turned to the downside. Because the foreign exchange seemed to be trending sideways, the gold price also fluctuated around seventy taels. Later, the market suddenly rose sharply, because the exchange rate rebounded, and the buyers in the market were numerous and their state was sharp. It once rose to seventy-six or seventy-seven taels, but there were slight ups and downs in between.</p>
<p>▲ High Opening Seen in the Morning: It opened sharply higher by six taels and eight mace in the morning, to six hundred and seventy-six taels. The next was seventy-six taels and five mace. Although the large bar fell by one-sixteenth, the US silver shrank by three-eighths. Soon the buyers were active. As Dayun Gang and Hongkang Yongheng Yu Tong Taichang and others sold, the price was unsustainable and fell by more than seven taels. There were occasional two-odd tael tops, until 9:20 am to 68 taels and 8 mace. But the various exchange rates were flat. When the British gold was announced, Yifeng Yongda Decheng and others bought, and then it increased to 71 taels. The HSBC quote did not move, but the internal affairs were flat. Huabi Mitsui offered March US dollars at 9375. Head-of-line traders came to sell, and it fell to 66 taels. Banks traded at 9375 with each other, and Tong Taichang Yifeng and others bought, slightly raising it by three taels and zero. At 10:00, it was 69 taels and a half. Then Hongkang Yongfu Yu Yuanmao Yongzhifeng Yongshunli and others sold together. Since US dollars could be traded at a difference of three yuan, it had depreciated by more than five taels. At 10:20, only 64 taels were recorded. Then it was flat. At 10 o'clock, Tong Taichang Yuancheng Yongzhifeng Yongyifeng Hengxing and others were buying. When US dollars could be sold at three yuan, it broke through 70 taels again. Dalian Gang also had a hand in it. At 11:00, it was 70 taels and five mace. However, Qian Changxiang Yongfeng Zhifeng Yongyifeng Yongyong and others sold on the market. And US dollars were settled at three yuan, so the price showed a weary trend again and plummeted by seven taels. At 11:30, it was 63 taels. Tong Taichang Hengyu goods and other purchases in a short time, then closed at 67 taels and a half. Then it jumped up two or three taels to 70 taels, which was actually bought by Tong Taichang. The listed price was still 744 taels. The total was calculated at 73 or 74 taels to 80 taels, and the noon close was 75 or 76 taels. ▲ After Lunch, the Shorts Were Fierce: The afternoon market opened at 70 taels, the next at 71 taels and 2 mace. Then, because Hengxing Shunli and others sold, it retreated to 69 taels. Later, the trend was good, because the US dollar was excellent. It initially settled at 875, then only 625. Mitsui Wheat and others all came out, and the buying trend on the surface was also strong. Hengyu Fuyu Hongkang Yong Yuanmao Yong Yifeng Yong Runchang Chuzhao Fengchang Yuhe and others competed to enter. Until 2:30 pm, it was 77 taels. Then, Tong Taichang Qian Changxiang Dadecheng goods and others sold. HSBC offered US dollars at 625, and Huabi offered 6875. So it went back down more than four taels. At 3:00, it was 72 taels and 2 mace. After that, US dollars at 625 were still hard to buy. Especially because the general shorts were eager to cover, Daxing Yongyu Da and others bought on behalf of Qiao Zhifu, so the price regained its fierceness and went forward bravely. At 4:10 pm, it was 76 taels and 8 mace. US dollars at 5625, British gold at 75. After entering, Yifeng came on the market to sell, and it retreated to 74 taels. However, people's hearts were unsettled. At 4:30 pm, the market closed at 75 taels and 8 mace, an increase of six taels and six mace compared to last Saturday. After the close, it traded at five taels or so. The daily high was 77 taels, and the low was 63 taels, a fluctuation of fourteen taels.

<h3>The Situation of Lixi and Chai Borrowing During the Final Account Period is Settled</h3>
<p>▲ Jiangjiao Soars by Four Li</p>
<p>▲ Market Overview: Silver businesses believe that due to the difficult market conditions during this final account period, it is not as easy to collect overdue payments as in previous years. Therefore, the scope of business is also smaller than last year. As a result, the prices of Lixi and Chai, due to supply and demand, are naturally not as high as in previous years. It is appropriate to settle the situation, and the prices will not change significantly.</p>
<p>▲ Lixi and Chai Prices: "Foreign Lixi" The buying and selling of foreign funds was sparse in the morning, and the prices were very flat.

<p>▲ Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small foreign coins were 6 qian, 6 fen, and 3 li in the early market, and 6 qian, 6 fen, and 5 li in the afternoon market.

Special funds collected and remitted more than 2.9 million dollars, settled more than 3.5 to 6 million dollars, entered the warehouse 600,000 dollars, and left the warehouse 1 million dollars. The number of money houses and silver public single collections and remittances was slightly higher due to the fact that it was the 25th of the month.

The number of head-of-line payments collected and remitted was 6.4 to 5 million dollars, the number of remittances from various routes was 600,000 dollars, and the cash collected was 300,000 to 400,000 dollars.

<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Suddenly Rise by One or Two Yuan</h3>
<p>▲ Market Sentiment Still Good, Market Conditions Average ▲ Trading Halted for Two Days Starting Today for Settlement</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 25th), the market conditions for various bonds on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were as follows: the January futures contracts were in their final day of trading, and trading will be halted starting today to prepare for settlement. This will allow for the processing of account transfers and pre-settlement calculations. Market conditions were average, remaining unchanged. Trading in the market remained sporadic, with spot trading being more active in the morning and less so in the afternoon. Regarding the trend of various bond prices, the overall bond market environment was slightly better than before, and the diplomatic situation seemed to have improved slightly. Additionally, with the January contracts reaching settlement, some retail investors were still investing in the market, while sellers remained cautious. Demand in the market exceeded supply, and prices suddenly rebounded across the board compared to the previous day. In fact, the market performance throughout yesterday was consistently good, with all bonds showing a gradual upward trend, which was unprecedented in recent weeks. As a result, compared to last weekend, only the 96 bonds remained sluggish and unchanged. The January demobilization bonds fell slightly by 0.02 yuan, while the February contracts and the January Nianjuan and Nian Customs bonds each rose by 0.06 or 0.07 yuan. Most other bonds rose by about 1.5 or 1.6 yuan, while the January contracts for customs consolidated debt and the 1929 Customs bonds rose by as much as 2 yuan, and the 1929 Customs bonds rose by 3.2 yuan. The January market unexpectedly showed signs of a short squeeze. Looking at the overall situation, there doesn't seem to be a significant shift in the situation at present. This may be a reaction to the excessive price drops and a temporary change, so we should not be overly optimistic. The total spot trading for the day was 28,600 yuan, while futures trading was 5,120,000 yuan in the morning and over 4,900,000 yuan in the afternoon, totaling 10,030,000 yuan. Furthermore, the Securities Exchange will be closed today to handle account transfers and settlement calculations. Tomorrow is settlement day, and there will be no trading in the market.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Still Difficult to Consolidate</h3>
<p>The yarn market started rising and then fell again, with the situation still weak. This is because of various rumors in the market, which have led to poor sentiment and retail investors selling off. However, due to the large trading volume this month, buyers have maintained a strong and firm stance, refusing to let go. The actual demand in the market is still not bad. In short, the unstable situation makes it difficult for people to feel secure, making it even harder for the market to consolidate.</p>
<p>▲ Morning Rise, Afternoon Fall in the Cotton Yarn Exchange Pit Trading</p>
<p>At the opening of the Cotton Yarn Exchange pit trading, the price of American cotton was average, and the sentiment for this month was very strong, which influenced the distant months. The prices of each month rose by 0.04, 0.05, and 0.06 yuan. However, at the close of the afternoon session, the prices suddenly fell, with each month falling by 0.03, 0.05, and 0.08 yuan due to numerous rumors about the current situation. The total trading volume for the day was 14,800 bales. The selling was as follows: Changfeng 400 bales, Hengyi 500 bales, Gongtai 550 bales, and Rongxing 900 bales. The buying was as follows: Jifeng 400 bales, Gongtai 400 bales, Yiyu 800 bales, and Yiyu 550 bales. The closing prices for the pit trading are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Contract Month | Closing Price (Yuan) | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| January | 15.60 | +0.03 | 24,300 |</p>
<p>| February | 15.60 | +0.06 | 48,150 |</p>
<p>| March | 15.56 | +0.03 | 59,400 |</p>
<p>| April | 15.54 | -0.01 | 53,300 |</p>
<p>| May | 15.55 | +0.01 | 44,850 |</p>

<p>▲ Sales of Spot Goods Are Still Not Bad</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn are still good. According to statistics, various groups purchased a total of 1,950 bales throughout the day. 55 bales were purchased by fellow merchants. Out-of-town merchants purchased 305 bales from inland, 200 bales from Changsha, 610 bales from Jiangxi, 500 bales from Guangdong, 15 bales from Ningbo, and 217 bales from Yunnan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Still Trending Upwards</h3>
<p>The overall cotton market is stable. This is because the price of American cotton is firm, and there is still no market for Indian cotton, which has calmed people's minds. Moreover, the spot market is relatively tight, and factories are slightly more active. The supply of Han-style cotton is becoming increasingly scarce, and local inventories are low. Therefore, some bulls are becoming increasingly strong, refusing to let go.</p>
<p>▲ More Rises Than Falls in Han-Style Cotton Bidding</p>
<p>At the opening of the Han-style cotton bidding at the exchange, American cotton prices were flat, and the situation in the market was still tight. Prices for various months rose by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan. The afternoon session was relatively flat. The total trading volume for the day was 49,800 dan. The selling was as follows: Tongxing 3,400 dan, Gengfeng 1,400 dan, and Jifeng 3,400 dan. The buying was as follows: Tianlong 2,200 dan, Changfeng 1,400 dan, Hengyi 1,400 dan, and Yichang 2,000 dan. The closing prices for the Han-style cotton bidding are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Contract Month | Closing Price (Yuan) | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| January | 32.50 | +0.01 | 49,400 |</p>
<p>| February | 32.90 | -0.05 | 150,800 |</p>
<p>| March | 33.10 | +0.10 | 179,900 |</p>
<p>| April | 33.35 | +0.10 | 158,500 |</p>
<p>| May | 33.65 | +0.15 | 112,200 |</p>
<p>| June | 33.80 | +0.10 | 86,800 |</p>
<p>▲ No Trading in Spot Cotton</p>
<p>There was no trading in spot cotton. The sources were 1,000 bales of Tonghua cotton and 350 bales of Yaohua cotton.</p>
<h3>Indian and British Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>▲ Bombay futures remained suspended last week due to political unrest. Bulls in Omra and Pingol have recently liquidated their positions, leading to a slight weakness in market conditions. Currently, Indian cotton prices are above any other cotton prices in the world, leading to a large-scale substitution of foreign cotton for Indian cotton. Indian holders are now inclined to sell, so Omra cotton has lost its firm foundation. There are slight inquiries for spot goods, but no transactions. Transporters are only buying for urgent needs, and local factories are also buying very little. Transactions with Japan are quite good. The attached statistics for the past week are as follows (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>|  | 1931 | 1932 |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Cumulative receipts since September 1 | 1255 | 527 |</p>
<p>| Weekend inventory | 745 | 422 |</p>
<p>| Cumulative exports since September 1 | 930 | 428 |</p>
<p>| Shipped to Europe | 216 | 73 |</p>
<p>| Shipped to China | 154 | 129 |</p>
<p>| Shipped to Japan | 552 | 206 |</p>
<p>| Other regions | 8 | 18 |</p>
<p>▲ Liverpool spot sales were very strong last week, and the futures market was firm due to a lack of hedging sales, limited speculative shorts, lower local inventories than usual, and a reduction in the power of the Indian Congress. Market prices were also supported by better buying power and remained strong. The Egyptian cotton market situation is gradually improving.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Downriver Continues Weak</h3>
<p>▲ Many ships arrived in South Shanghai yesterday, but trading in this area was sluggish. There is a large amount of inventory, and due to the warmer weather, people are bearish. Wholesale transactions are not smooth, but retail sales are not weak, which has led to a softening of prices. Sales of foreign rice are minimal, and prices are unchanged. White glutinous rice and early thin rice from Suzhou and Changzhou are each down by 0.10 to 0.05 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ The Xinchang rice market has not improved. The appetite of various shops is weaker than before, and customers are uniformly closing their positions. Northern glutinous rice, thin rice, and early rice have fallen by about 0.10 yuan. A survey at 4:30 PM yesterday found approximately 250 rice boats around the Sampan Factory, Xinqiao, and Wuzhen Road Bridge, with approximately 30,000 shi of total white glutinous rice and indica rice.</p>
<h3>Spot Foreign Rice Customer Demand Stagnant</h3>
<p>▲ Expectations Good for Futures Xiaojiao Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market had signs of looking up, but there was still no demand from customers, and the local market had no appetite. The market was instead soft. Although there were continued expectations of price increases for futures West-style rice, foreign firms were still selling, and prices did not rise. The opening price for spot goods was 11.70 yuan for 400 bags of No. 1 Saigon West-style debt, 9.75 yuan for 300 bags of Xiaojiao rice, and 10.01 yuan for 100 bags of Baisheng Xiaojiao rice. For futures, Yuanli offered 700 tons of No. 1 Saigon for immediate shipment at 5.32 taels, and Lidain offered 500 tons for March shipment at 5.28 taels. Returned goods included 100 tons of Xiaojiao rice for April shipment at 4.80 taels.</p>
<h3>Taizhou Rice Arrives with Strong Sales</h3>
<p>Since the bridge was cut off for Xiang and Gan indica rice in the Shanghai market, it has relied only on the railway line and goods from Anhui province, but the supply has been intermittent and small. Recently, Taizhou rice has continued to arrive, which has been welcomed by the local market. Yesterday, 1,000 bags of newly arrived Taizhou white rice were opened for sale at 11.10 to 11.50 yuan, and 300 bags of early rice were opened for sale at 10.03 to 10.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Starch Bidding Initially Weak, Then Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the starch market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month generally showed a trend of initially being weak and then becoming strong. This was because the price of foreign wheat was down by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan or 0.05 to 0.06 yuan, which made people feel quite weak. The settlement for this month is approaching, and there are few buyers, so the market remains average. However, for February to May, the bullish sentiment of outside investors is quite strong. Based on the recent situation, the traditional "red market" may see a period of high profits, with people buying goods for the New Year in the hope of selling them for a good price in the future. Therefore, all prices have seen increases. However, manufacturers are still releasing inventory, and the amount for June is smaller than for May, so the future outlook is still uncertain. As a result, the price for this month is 0.005 yuan higher than the previous day, February is 0.02 yuan higher, March is 0.0225 yuan higher, April is 0.03 yuan higher, and May and June are 0.015 yuan higher.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Firm</h3>
<p>▲ Grain and Miscellaneous Goods Exchange Halted Forward Trading until the 27th</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month generally showed a stable trend. This was because the price of foreign wheat was down by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan in Chicago and down by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan in Canada, which made people feel uncertain. However, this month was the last day of trading. There was no movement in the morning, but in the initial afternoon session, the price rose to a maximum of 3.47 taels due to a squeeze of outside shorts. However, in the second session, the price fell back down as bulls liquidated their positions. In a flash, supply exceeded demand again. For the distant months, people's sentiment was initially flat and then stable. Although the New Year is approaching, some bulls are taking in profits, which has led to a stabilizing trend. As a result, the prices for this month and February are unchanged from the previous day, March is 0.03 yuan higher, April and May are 0.02 yuan higher, and June is unchanged.</p>
<p>The Grain and Miscellaneous Goods Exchange has decided to halt forward trading until the 27th. Trading for this month ended yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Flat, Quiet, but Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received news from the production areas. The spot price of Cuban sugar was still 1.09375, while the futures prices for New York sugar were 1.05 for March, 1.08 for May, 1.17 for September, and 1.23 for December, each down by 0.02 yuan from the previous telegram. Only May was down by only 0.01 yuan. The spot and futures prices for Javanese sugar were still unchanged. The market was flat, and transactions were quiet, but the market sentiment was particularly strong. The daily transaction price for No. 24 coarse sand Dutch sugar was still 9.75 taels, and the supply was very limited. Cotton Dutch white sugar was 11.7 taels, No. 16 medium sand white sugar was 9.5 taels, and No. 8 Dutch red sugar was 8.4 taels. The trends were all bullish. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 11.725 taels, HX mark was 11.65 taels, and HM mark was 11.35 taels. Transactions were very quiet, and the market conditions for each were stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, European and American Silk Telegrams Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign merchant silk market in Shanghai became even more quiet. According to inquiries, there was still no demand for Chinese silk in the European and American markets, and the silk telegrams were unchanged. Chinese silk merchants were preparing to close, and the market atmosphere was bleak. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others purchased 10 bales of dried Dada silk at flat prices.</p>
<h3>Lyon Italian Silk Down 5-6 Francs</h3>
<p>The Lyon market has seen no improvement in the sales of raw silk factories recently, and silk prices have been consistently weak. Last weekend, Italian silk Variété grade was only 195 francs per kilo, Spécial grade was 163 francs, and Superior grade was 130 francs, each down by 5-6 francs per kilo.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firm Tea Market Suddenly Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm tea market in Shanghai suddenly became quiet. European firms were mostly watching due to the lack of inventory in the market and the firm attitude of Chinese merchants. The entire market saw only Tongfu Foreign Firm buying more than 40 cases of Zhenmei green tea, and the selling price was unchanged. There were no other transactions.</p>
<h3>Textile Settlement Period Approaching, Textile Market Gradually Declining</h3>
<p>The textile market situation remains sluggish. In reality, the vitality of the country has been greatly damaged after the domestic floods, and it has not yet recovered. The sluggishness of sales has reached its extreme. Recently, as the final settlement period approaches, people are becoming increasingly panicked. Holders are eager to sell off their goods, so prices are rapidly declining. The quotation for Yuanfang this period has seen another decline. Yuan Yu silk and bleached cloth have fallen by about one to two yuan. Although the price of 1.6-foot Yuan velvet has also fallen, there are few inquiries. The prices of domestically produced Zhigong ni, serge, and white flannel have seen more declines than increases. Coarse cloth is down by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan. 9-pound goods are 0.45 to 0.55 taels, 10-pound goods are 0.70 to 0.75 taels, and 11-pound goods are 0.485 to 0.90 taels. The previously firm 16-pound goods have also fallen to 7.8 taels. 13-pound double-ply goods opened at 6.3 taels yesterday, while Shuang Ma Ma Gou was 2.5 yuan, but there are few buyers. Fine cloth is relatively stable due to the scarcity of goods. Peacock is 7.4 taels, Siping Lian is 7.3 taels, and Ren Zhong is 7.25 taels, but there is also a lack of market.</p>
<h3>Coal, Shanxi White Coal Sales Sluggish and Secretly Weak</h3>
<p>Recently, purchasing by various groups of Shanxi white coal customers has been lax, and sales by local coal shops have also been sluggish. Therefore, daily market transactions are exceptionally quiet, and selling prices are unstable, secretly weakening day by day. Yesterday, the market opened at 134 tons, with each ton selling for only 20 taels.</p>

<h3>Mini-Forum: The Misfortune of Waste</h3>
<p>The great British thinker H.G. Wells considered "waste" to be a "calamity of mankind," ranking it alongside old age, sickness, poverty, and death as an "enemy of humanity," which he vehemently attacked. Of course, the "waste" he referred to here encompasses material waste, spiritual waste, and waste of time.</p>
<p>I believe that waste should be further divided into two types: unintentional and intentional. If one continues to read when their mental faculties are already exhausted, it will inevitably lead to a situation where the book is just a book, and the reader is just a reader, with no real understanding gained. This is a waste of spirit and time, and it is unconscious and unintentional. As for things like prostitution, gambling, opium, horse racing, and extravagant spending, these simultaneously inflict irreparable losses on material possessions, spirit, and time. This type of waste is intentional and conscious, and it is essentially a sin. Those who intentionally commit such sins in Shanghai are ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Just pay attention to the lives of ordinary people: waking up at noon has become a "customary law" for Shanghainese. Otherwise, unless you were born with a lowly destiny, you would be forced to sell your blood and sweat to support your family's dwindling existence. After waking up, the natural thing to do is have breakfast, followed by eight rounds of mahjong. Those who can't play mahjong can spend their time in tea houses, pubs, and opium dens. By the time the city lights begin to illuminate, their spirits are even more invigorated. Those with cars take cars, those without cars take chartered cars, and the worst off take rickshaws and trams, all heading towards theaters, clubs, gambling dens, amusement parks, cafes, cinemas, dance halls, and brothels, desperately squeezing in. They squander money like dirt, frantically diminish their energy, and waste time. By the time they are bored and head home, it is already one or two in the morning. This is how a Shanghainese spends their day, and this is how a Shanghainese spends their life. This extremely hateful form of waste naturally has its own "philosophical foundation" and is not accidental. "Drink today, for tomorrow we may have no money and be filled with worry." "Life is less than a hundred years, yet we harbor worries of a thousand autumns. Since the short nights are filled with hardship, why not light candles and enjoy ourselves?" Shanghainese are most adept at understanding the mysteries of this "philosophy of life," and they are the most capable of putting it into practice. Therefore, the common greeting is: "What are you doing for entertainment today?" The Shanghainese dictionary only contains the word "entertainment" and not "waste." People should live in entertainment and should live for entertainment. The gongs and drums of the Great Stage, the violins in the cafes, and the alluring eyes and white flesh in the dance halls all endlessly draw Shanghainese towards the path of entertainment. Shanghainese, entertainment ah, entertainment is life ah! Amen, I should bless the clever Shanghainese.</p>
<h3>Popular Science: What is Air?</h3>
<p>Bingbing:</p>
<p>Qingqing: "Last time, we figured out that you and I eat 7,200 bowls of air a day. Now I want to ask, what exactly is air?"</p>
<p>Yingying: "Air contains two kinds of gases: one is oxygen, and the other is nitrogen."</p>
<p>Qingqing: "What is oxygen? What is nitrogen?"</p>
<p>Yingying: "Oxygen supports combustion, and nitrogen does not support combustion."</p>
<p>Qingqing: "What does it mean to support combustion? What does it mean to not support combustion?"</p>
<p>Yingying: "To support combustion means to help things burn; to not support combustion means to not help things burn. Anything can be burned in oxygen, so oxygen has combustion-supporting properties. Nothing can be burned in nitrogen, so nitrogen has non-combustion-supporting properties."</p>
<p>Qingqing: "Can you show me these two gases?"</p>
<p>Yingying: "We can find out by doing a simple experiment. You fill a basin with half a basin of water, take a glass, light a strip of waste paper with a match, put it in the glass, and immediately cover the glass flat in the center of the water while the flame is burning strongly, stop for a moment, and then lift it up by half an inch (without lifting it out of the water). What changes do you see?"</p>
<p>Qingqing: "A lot of water has entered the cup. What is the reason for this?"</p>
<p>Yingying: "Oxygen helps the waste paper burn, and the waste paper burns into charcoal, which combines with oxygen to become carbon dioxide, which dissolves in the water. Therefore, almost all the oxygen in the cup has turned into something else and dissolved in the water, and the space that is freed up allows the outside atmosphere to push the water up to occupy it. Apart from water, the cup now mostly contains nitrogen."</p>
<p>Qingqing: "How do we know that the remaining gas is mostly nitrogen?"</p>
<p>Yingying: "Because it does not support combustion. Things cannot be burned inside. If you don't believe me, we can try. You put your left hand at the bottom of the basin of water, palm up, and move the mouth of the glass onto your palm, being careful not to let the mouth of the glass leave the water surface and not to let gas in. Then, hold the bottom of the glass with your right fingers, and tightly support the mouth of the glass with your left palm. You see, there is water at the bottom of the cup and gas at the top; most of this gas is nitrogen, and a fire cannot be lit inside. I'll strike a match to try... Strike! You take your left hand away, and I'll put the lit match into the nitrogen in the cup... Look!"</p>
<p>Qingqing: "The match went out so quickly!"</p>

<p>News Boy (news boy referring to a bamboo ear pick), poem</p>
<p>At the street corner, bustling and noisy,</p>
<p>Cars, big and small, move like dragons in a row.</p>
<p>Someone holds news boys in hand,</p>
<p>On the cement pavement, desolate and still.</p>
<p>A long gown, with many holes,</p>
<p>A face weathered, thin and frail.</p>
<p>"Friend, is business good or not?</p>
<p>How much money can you make in a day?"</p>
<p>Occasionally a passerby asks,</p>
<p>His face bears a smile as he speaks.</p>
<p>He does not answer at first, seemingly lost,</p>
<p>Later he asks in return, "Do you want one?"</p>
<p>Hearing "no," he is silent,</p>
<p>His gaze wanders along the street.</p>
<p>"How much do you sell in good times?</p>
<p>How much do you sell in bad times?"</p>
<p>The passerby asks again,</p>
<p>"How much is enough to get by for a day?"</p>
<p>"In good times, I sell one for four coppers,</p>
<p>In bad times, I sell several copper coins."</p>
<p>He pauses for a moment, then speaks again,</p>
<p>His teeth chatter, tears flow freely.</p>
<p>"No matter how much money I make,</p>
<p>I always just scrape by, day after day."</p>
<p>"Why not change your trade?</p>
<p>What trade is most suitable?</p>
<p>I have no backing to become an official,</p>
<p>I have no capital to engage in commerce,</p>
<p>I have no learning to become a scholar,</p>
<p>I have no strength to become a bandit!"</p>
<p>News boy, no news,</p>
<p>The questioner turns and walks away.</p>
<p>Many come, but none stop.</p>
<p>The sun sets, the lights come on, the night market opens,</p>
<p>On the cement pavement, silence reigns.</p>
<p>News boy, no news.</p>
<p>(★Street Sociology★ Kneeling There! One Factory)</p>
<p>Every time after work or in the evening, I walk to the area around Tibet Road Race Course to breathe some relatively fresh air. I often see several old men with white beards and several old women with wrinkled skin and white hair, kneeling under the iron fence of the race course, their eyes sunken and weak, barely able to open, begging weakly and intermittently for money.</p>
<p>Whether they get money or not depends on the pleasure of the modern gentlemen and modern ladies. Sometimes, it is the men and women friends wearing rough cloth shirts who give them one or two more copper coins.</p>
<p>"Providing for the elderly until their end" is a fundamental principle of humanity. Why are they forced to "have no end in old age," kneeling there every day? There is also a need to quickly establish orphanages and homes for the elderly so that they can "have an end in old age." "Respect the elderly of my family, and extend that respect to the elderly of others." May all the people of Shanghai pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(East, South, West, North) Six-Jiao Stamps, Gold Exchange, by Jin Huan</p>
<p>"The widowed Mrs. X has a small inheritance and only one daughter. The daughter has a rudimentary understanding of literature and wishes to find a young man aged twenty to thirty, of mild temperament, to marry into the family. Having a current occupation would be even better. Those interested please send letters to ×× County, × Gate, ×× Street, No. ×××, care of Ms. ○○ (the daughter's name), sent by Ms. ○○ (the mother's name)."</p>
<p>An advertisement of this kind was published in a certain newspaper a month ago.</p>
<p>A friend of my friend, Mr. Wang, is an employee in a certain factory in this city. His parents have both passed away, and he is the only one left, living a monotonous life in this world of "deceit and suspicion." Fortunately, he still has a job, and his life is not bad. In this year, he often feels the pain of "being of age, but finding no kindred spirit." Now there is such an advertisement, with an address and a name, for "seeking a son-in-law." He doesn't think he will be cheated, so he makes up his mind to respond.</p>
<p>After he sent out his response letter, his heart was never at peace, and he was constantly waiting for their reply. He was responding with 120,000 percent sincerity and also holding 120,000 percent hope, hoping that "their fate was predestined from a previous life." It's here! The letter is here! He opens the envelope happily. The content is:</p>
<p>(Above omitted) "We have received your letter and are honored by the overwhelming number of responses from all over the country. We are especially notifying those who have been preselected. My daughter is 24 years old and graduated from ×× junior high school. If you are willing to join our family, you will of course be treated as our own son. You can engage in business or continue your studies, but you are limited to advancing your study in engineering. This matter should not be taken lightly. We plan to first communicate directly and then arrange a meeting. Please send us a photo of yourself with a six-jiao stamp for postage. We will send you a photo of my daughter after we receive your photo. Please keep it safe and confidential. With best wishes for the winter, Ms. ×× (the mother's name)." This tone is extremely gracious, and Mr. Wang is really about to encounter "peach blossom luck." However, the "six-jiao stamp" aroused suspicion again. Since they are formally seeking a partner, why do they need to care about this six jiao? Ah! Could it be that they are actually a scheme?</p>
<p>Never mind it, don't miss the opportunity. They want postage anyway, so I'll just attach it every time. Mr. Wang replied in this way.</p>
<p>However, the "six-jiao stamp" is their only prerequisite!</p>
<p>Six jiao...six jiao...angered Mr. Wang greatly. He no longer thought about the beautiful wife or the inheritance. He determined that they were a scam. Six jiao per person, and it would be considerable with a large number of people. He unhesitatingly sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau of ×× County, requesting "investigation, arrest, and interrogation." Sure enough, evidence and witnesses were obtained, but the person involved was completely unaware. It was actually the daughter's older brother, ××, who did this. "I am testing social psychology," he argued. Result: Six-jiao stamp │ Half a year in prison.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Story</h3>
<p>(19) Compiled and Translated by Zhou Rong</p>
<p>(Shanghai Story)</p>
<p>×The Impact of the Knife Society Occupation</p>
<p>Since the conflict between the government and bandits began, the commerce of the concession area has been greatly affected for seventeen months. At that time, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was also prospering. From Zhenjiang upwards, the Yangtze River basin was blocked by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Therefore, the trade of various commercial ports along the Yangtze River almost completely disintegrated and suffered a setback. Most of Zhejiang Province was also occupied by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom at the same time, so Shanghai had no inland goods imported at all. Although the Knife Society was quickly suppressed, people were still panicked and felt uneasy, and their purchasing power also decreased. Various imported goods, such as cotton yarn, were all stockpiled in warehouses and had no sales.</p>
<p>At that time, various businesses were stagnated. Only the import of opium suddenly increased sharply. This item was still transported by the British. It was shipped from abroad to Wusongkou and then smuggled ashore in small boats. Between 1847 and 1849, the average total import of opium was 18,814 boxes, with an average value of 11,185,000 yuan. By 1853, it increased to 24,200 boxes, with a value of 14,400,000 yuan. In the following years, it increased to 33,069 boxes. At that time, the members of the Small Sword Society all smoked opium as a major customer, so British merchants secretly protected them as much as possible. However, French merchants could not enjoy this kind of original profit, so the British in the concession area helped the bandits, while the French helped the government. This is a proof of the division among imperialists in China due to their different interests. "The occupation of the city by the Knife Society had a great impact on the import of various goods except opium, but the overseas demand for the import of Chinese goods increased instead. Taking Chinese tea as an example, the tea from Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang and other provinces transported by land to Shanghai for export was 69 million pounds in 1853. In the following year, due to the occupation of the city by the Knife Society, it suddenly decreased to 50 million pounds. By 1855, after the Knife Society withdrew from the county seat, it increased sharply to 80 million pounds, an increase of 11 million pounds compared with 1853. It can be seen that the increase in overseas demand for Chinese tea at that time was quite rapid.</p>
<p>The silk industry was also like the tea market. In 1851, the export of silk was 20,360 bales, and in 1853 it increased to 58,319 bales. Since Nanjing was occupied by the Taiping Army, the people suffered unspeakably and were unable to buy silk fabrics. Therefore, the silk produced in Suzhou, Hangzhou and other places had to seek markets overseas. Therefore, exports exceeded imports, and the inflow of silver was enough to maintain the balance of foreign trade.</p>
