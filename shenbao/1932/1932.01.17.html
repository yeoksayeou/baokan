<h3>日本覆美照會</h3>
<p>藉口中國政局不靖</p>
<p>希圖卸除公約責任</p>
<p>結語對美隠含冷嘲</p>
<p>(東京)新外相芳澤今晨以答覆美國照會請注意九國公約義務事之文、送交美大使福白斯、此文措詞、固可令人安心、但出以冷峻的禮貌、其結句曰、有不妨確信者、美政府以友好精神對於時局之正確了解、現加以若是殷勤之注意云、此句殆含有不滿於美政府此舉之意、覆文要點如下、</p>
<p>㈠重行聲明滿洲門户開放政策、而以中國各處狀况不定、致使此政策之效力大爲減少爲憾、㈡承認美國不能承認凡可損害其條約權利的·或因用非凱洛格和平公約所許方法而產生的事件之合法、㈢中國現有之不寗靜狀態、非列强在華盛頓締結公約時所料及、雖該約條文之束縛性質不能受其影響、但在實際上、此種局勢可變更該約條文之適用、因條文必參酌現有之事態而適用之也、㈣滿洲行政人物之任何變更、乃由地方官吏大都非逃即辭、而不安於其位、致使行政機關傾覆、而不得不由他人代行職權、以謀地方安全所致、㈤日本在滿不抱土地目的或野心、此可無須再行聲明、惟美國所須知者、滿洲之戰爭與安全、及其可利於一般貿易之情形、乃日本人民深切注意、並視爲非常重要之事件云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>(東京)日本對美覆牒、已於今晨十一時三十分送出、同時由外務省發表其内容、再三申辯日本之尊重非戰公約與九國公約、重行聲明承認滿州門户開放政</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>策、但以滿蒙之不安定情形、致門户開放之利益未能實現、引爲遺憾、其中最不合情理處、則係聲稱凡當援用涉及整個中國之條約時、應就中國目前政局之變動加以考慮、當華府會議締結九國公約之際、不能預料邇來中國歷年之不安靖等語、此外又狡辯日人不負滿蒙華人政府機關更迭之責任、諉爲東北三省人民自組獨立政府、并一再聲明日本在滿蒙并無土地野心、僅要求地方之和平安靖、與自由貿易及經濟發展之機會而已、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>(東京)日本之復文草就已一星期、惟因候芳澤之返國、故遲遲至今始能發出、日本復文之内容、據云、係不承認日本在東三省之軍事行動、爲違反國際間之和約、而對於佔領錦州之舉、尤堅執其採行之必要、按美國原有牒文係一月八日發出同時致中日二國、而中國之復文已於日前送達、極贊同美國之舉動、并表示願美國繼續努力維持國際條約之尊嚴、以制止日本在華之侵略行爲、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>日本對英表示</h3>
<p>保證東省門户開放</p>
<p>英國取不干涉態度</p>
<p>(倫敦)日大使松平今日至外部向英政府傳述日政府所發日本在滿並無土地野心之保證、查美政府照會日本請其注意九國公約義務時、英國請日本重行聲明日本未有土地野心、並尊重滿洲門户開放之原則、及九國公約之條文、故今日松平有此答覆、聲明日本對於上述諸點、並未變更政策、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>(倫敦)據此間一般人預料、日大使旣有此保證、英國對於遼案在日内瓦國聯理事會重開以前、未必再有所行動、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>(東京)日本許多要人現以爲滿洲主要軍事行動現已完成、建設階叚、行將開始、但觀過去一星期中、匪軍加於小隊自兵之打擊、似表示日軍尙須從事於肅淸匪患之工作也、滿洲各處匪氛甚熾、而勝利辄屬於匪軍、以其出没不定、組織簡單且有騎隊能伺日軍弱點、倐出襲擊、而日軍則未有充分力量、在此廣大區域内維持强大兵也、滿洲日軍當道遂有再調兵三師入滿之請、聞諸可恃方面、日政府未必能依允此請、同時本莊部下現以剿匪爲務、尤注重新民與錦西一帶、並令滿洲新政府採行同樣計畫、以恢復和平、據日人言、日本對於滿洲政府將用何種政體之問題、不甚介意、祗欲其能保障和平與秩序、而便日本行使其合法權利耳、但就有勢力日人之新近言論觀之、日本頗有在滿洲採用門羅主義之意、其答覆英國所發保證滿洲門户開放政策之請也、對於英國不干涉之態度、表示謝意、而其答覆美國照會也、則其結語中所含之反請語、似使人確信日本將以門羅主義施於滿洲、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>日機轟炸賓州事我國報告國聯</h3>
<p>(日内瓦)中政府今日致文國聯秘書處報告日飛機於一月十日以炸彈擲擊賓州城事、謂此舉實大背及蔑視國聯行政會之决議案云、（十六日路透電）</p>

<p>(華盛頓)中國公使顏惠慶今夜乘快車赴紐約、乘輪往歐、代施肇基出席國際聯盟理事會議、并將領袖中國代表團出席下月二日開幕之軍縮大會、顏氏在此間啓程前聲稱、國聯理事會本月二十五日續行開會討論遼案時、中國將重行要求國聯義務之履行、與尊重各和平公約條約之神聖、謂我人不欲要求他國爲中國作戰、但將詢問其有無遵行手簽條約之心、顏氏又論及日政府所稱一九○五年中國允不築鐵路與南滿並行之約、謂日方之要求、僅根據於會議錄、但亦祇爲當時討論南滿鄰近建築鐵路之結果、至對於外間盛傳中國將要求援用國聯會章第十六欵對日施行經濟制裁之說、顏氏不願有所表示、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>義勇軍官佐請派飛機助戰</h3>

<h3>立法院常會接開秘密會議</h3>
<p>各部長出席報告政情</p>
<p>長時間討論對日方針</p>
<p>衛挺生攻擊公債停息</p>
<p>(南京)立法院十六上午舉行一七五次大會、覃振主席通過閩贛魯豫四省徵收營業稅條例、及施行細則條例後、即囑旁聽人一律退席、由内長李文範·外次傅秉常·海軍部長陳紹寛出席、報告内政外交海軍各項情形、財軍兩長未及出席、（十六日專電）</p>
<p>南京　十六晨九時、立法院一七五次會、九時半改開秘密會、内長李文範·海長陳紹寛·外次傅秉常·均到會報告、先由傳報告外交經過及外部採取方針、次李報告國難會議已定二十五日開會、次陳報告海軍近狀、各委對外部採取對日方針、及絶交問題、發言極多、衛挺生對政府財政上採取停付内債本息問題、認爲根據錯誤之理論、造成經濟上絶大糾紛、實爲不當、至財政方面非絶無辦法、并列舉數字以證明之、時已十二時一刻、主席覃振發言、以爲今日是請行政當局報告、不必有所辯難、定下星期二再開會討論、遂宣告散會、（十六日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）立法院代理院長覃振談今晨大會、特請行政當局列席、對外交財政各問題、交換意見、政府如無非常之策略、以展開新局面、恐難渡此危關、覃對外交不主張與日絶交、對國内銀行家有不恕之詞、且主張停付公債本息云、（十六日專電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>異哉所謂「淸日密約彬」</h3>
<p>日本突然對我東北實施暴力發動强佔我半壁河山。據其所宣傳之理由。爲維護其在我東北之正當權益。在暴力掠奪之下。其所謂「正當權益。」今應亦已足以「維護」而滿足其帝國主義侵掠之野心矣。但最近復忽由外務省正式公佈所謂「淸日密約。」並謂當明治三十八年十二月訂立中日關於東三省條約及附約時。日本曾要求將約束事項挿入條文中。淸廷方面因對内關係。不能公表。遂决定不公布。此種事實。適足以顯示其手段之陰險。直無所不用其極。此種國際間不名譽之行爲。吾人不能不從事實上予以嚴正之駁斥。</p>
<p>日政府公布此一所謂「密約」之用意。當着重在第三條不准敷設與滿鐵並行之路綫一條。此一密約之毫無根據。吾人覓得多方面之反證。第一唐紹儀氏爲一九零五年中日會議秘書之一曾於一九零八年一月二十八日在奉天巡撫任時發表談話斷言「並無禁止中國建築南滿鐵路平行綫任何協定之存在」並謂「當時並未簽訂密約此事當爲北京公使團所熟知。」唐氏當時旣已公開否認假如果眞有此「密約」日本當時何不公布。第二。此項公文假如果眞。日本何以終始未向國際聯盟秘書廳登記。又未按華盛頓會議關於遠東事件議决案第十一項向美國國務院登記。第三。當一九零六年一月二十三日中日新訂東三省條約及附約交換批准書之時。同時並未含有任何附帶之議定書或其他之承認。第四。滿鐵平行綫問題。於光緒三十三年秋曾一度發生。當時淸政府郵傳部擬將關外鐵路由新民展至法庫。以備續展至洮南而達江省。日本代理公使阿部聞之。致文郵傳部詰責。引所謂光緒三十一年之「密約」爲抗議之根據。淸政府外務部曾致文制覆有云。「貴大臣援引中日會議錄爲據。謂中國置成約於不理。有侵害南滿鐵路利益之舉動。不知當日中日全權大臣商定此條之時。中國全權即以並行二字範圜甚廣。必須定以里數。明言在若干里以内不能築造並綫。日本全權以爲若定里數。自他國視之。必有限制中國造路之意。繼又請按照歐美通例。定出並行綫相距里數。又以通例亦不一律。不必載明。並由日本全權聲明。中國將來凡有發達滿洲之舉。日本决不阻攔。其言自是出於至誠。兼具篤念友邦之意。自應彼此遵守。」第五。依據日俄所訂朴茨茅斯和約第四條之規定。「日俄兩國。互相約定。對於凡中國所採各國通用一般計劃以開發東三省工商事業者不加阻撓」朴茨茅斯和約中旣有如斯之約定。則所謂不准建築與滿鐵平行之鐵路之密約。自無存在之。理第六。日本政府對於一八九九年美國國務卿海約翰提出之門户開放節略。曾於一八九九年十二月二十八日答覆。聲明日本願無條件接受此項政策。如此「密約」果眞。則是違背門户開放主義之精。神美克萊德在國際競爭中之滿洲一書中亦曾有云。「日本曾因所謂「密約。」而受人攻擊。因爲她欲破壞滿洲門户開放主義的精神。」第七。假如此項「密約」果眞。則又是違背一九二二年二月六日簽訂之九國遠東公約。依據上述七項事實與理由之反證。則此項「密約」之無存在之價値。蓋昭昭綦明。日政府此時乃忽然公佈。冀欲以增多其暴力發動之藉口之資料。嗚呼。天下耳目。果能以一手掩盡耶。</p>
<p>總之今日之事。在日人暴力威脅之下。固復有何是非曲直可說。中日間一切不平等條約。何莫非日人用狡猾陰毒之手段威迫簽訂。吾人今日如果能以武力收回失地。驅逐暴軍出境則是非典直不明自明。「密約」之有。無更無須計較。如其不能。則無亦有。是亦。非强權之世界。固尙有公道是非之可言耶。</p>

<p>▲路透十六日莫斯科電蘇俄太斯通信社今晨披露蘇俄政府欲與日本締結侵不略條約、與蘇俄前與歐洲隣邦所締結者同之意、據該社稱、日外相芳澤於十二月三十一日過莫斯科時、俄外長李維諾夫曾向之提議、俄日可締結不侵略條約、今國外軍事與冒險界方作種種推測之詞、以爲兩國邦交有變劣之可能、在此時期若成立此約則極關重要、李維諾夫又請芳澤注意於俄國與西方諸國關於不侵略條約之談判、並聲明蘇俄隣邦之未締結此約或談判此約者厥爲日本一國、該通信社又謂一月十二日駐日俄大使晤日相犬養、談滿洲事、尤注重北滿境内日軍事、俄大使詢問犬養對於俄外長向芳澤提議事之態度、犬養答稱、日本絶無侵犯滿洲俄國利益成中東路利益之意、至於不侵略條約一層、則日政府尙未加以研究云、</p>

<p>▲國民十六日莫斯科電今日俄官塲力闢日人消息所稱日前俄大使訪見犬養毅時、曾探測日本對於締結日俄同盟態度之說、鄭重聲明俄國從未向日本新外相或前外相作締結同盟之說、謂俄大使與犬養毅相晤時、所談以東三省事情爲主、尤其關於北滿白俄份子政治與軍事準備之復活問題、但亦承認俄大使於談話、時曾提及日俄商訂不侵犯條約之說、詢問日方態度曾否决定、此說係俄外交委員李維諾夫於芳澤過境時提出、據聞犬養毅答稱、日政府尙未暇研究此事、但同時向俄大使保證日本無意侵犯蘇俄利益與中東鐵路云、</p>

<h3>一家人何分勝負</h3>
<p>昨日之、戰雙方原自一家、人勝敗利鈍不足計、重在中華之各别人才及其整個團體之工、作爲將來正式出戰陣線之張本、馬來隊不過居賓客地位耳、然其敗挫、由於中衛線柔弱、内衛欠平穏、而前鋒動作、尤見緩慢、惟守門獨成績驚人、上半時倍受困阨、連失六球、下半時扎掙甚力、奪來一球、似乎中華有敬客之嫌疑、結果六對一、中華勝、裁判陳吉、祥</p>
<h3>二守門勞逸不同</h3>
<p>中華之周賢言、馬來之黄錦柏、同具驚人材能之守門也、惟因内衛輔佐之得力與否、遂生勞逸不同之結果、終九十分鐘内、周賢言撲空一次、是其失着、　寗刀奪出險、幸免大難、最後所失一球、周氏乃盡地主之誼耳、黄錦柏身成衆矢之的、滿城風雨、難免顧此失彼、第四球由陳洪光乘𨻶闖入、乃黄氏觀望之過、大屢將傾、一木焉能支住、此外所失五球、咎在輔佐之不得力耳、</p>
<h3>老伴侶久别重逢</h3>
<p>李寗馮運佑樂華黄金時代内之老伴侶、後此各奔前程、分道揚鑣今番服務中華、久别重逢刦奪欄擋、金城鐵壁無異矣、下半時江善警之表演亦甚滿意、總之大有天壤之别馬來五鋒、處處碰壁、誠有行不得也之慨矣、</p>
<h3>中衛綫攻守兼施</h3>
<p>雙方高下最顯明之點、厥在中衛綫之强弱、馬來黄克厚尙能應付一而、然不克統顧全局、限於資質也中華三人、則極有作爲中堅屠開元無論矣、蓋方今華人中堅之第一人也、而陳家球梁樹棠軟硬攻守四美皆俱上半時安内攘外、爲凈勝六球之功臣、下半時改換陣綫、不及上半時緊凑多矣、</p>
<h3>五虎將生氣勃然</h3>
<p>中華前鋒五將、個個生氣勃然就事論事、戴麟經身領三軍無役不從、假勢射擊、打破馬來第一聲戴之力也、傳送得勢、接濟有方、是其專長、梅洪寳石翼、極有供獻、行動迅速、挑撥適、中不可多得之、才陳洪光鋒芒十、足獨得三球、占全數半、其福至心靈之謂乎、錢敬鏞大可造就、咎在求勝過切、時有越位犯規、陳虞添身段靈巧、射中一球、即在善於本人之特長也如果陳鎭和丘東炎在塲、當更有不少驚人之表演矣、</p>
<h3>一口氣呵成六球</h3>
<p>再論戰事經、過初十分鐘、中華雖得風助、局勢尙平穏、迨至梅洪寳自右挑左、錢洪光側身讓去、錢敬鏞還送、戴麟經順水推舟、射入門内、和平局而已破中華遂源源中的不三分鐘、陳洪光挑中、又五分鐘、戴氏切中木柱彈入、再八分鐘、洪光連中二次、最後一球、由陳嗔添踼入、拼成半打之數、上半時遂告終局、</p>
<h3>敬遠客奉送一隻</h3>
<p>馬來前鋒、在初未尙不盡力進展、顧難深入腹地、施其射擊手段、下半時中華前鋒意在敷延了事、馬來反攻之時較多、然病在緩慢、門前失去機會、不可勝紀、如能準確有力、必有造就、彼時戴氏先後三射莫不驚人、守門置之有方、化險爲夷、末後馬來關信德在對方不抵抗表示中射中一球、保全凈敗紀錄、結果一對六、爲馬來來滬之第四次失敗、</p>
<h3>逸園冷淸淸樂華敗於海軍</h3>
<p>▲二比四丨甲組賽</p>
<p>樂華足球隊昨日冷淸淸之逸園中、以二比四敗英海軍、此爲甲組賽陣線不齊、表演減色、遂令水手得以報復前之七比一之宿仇焉、</p>
<h3>冷落之情景</h3>
<p>球員除外、廣大之座位上、統共不滿三十人、新聞記者佔其四、尙有園中之職員侍役等、亦在此三十人中、女賓絶無僅有、向之車如游龍者、昨則僅三輛而已、不勝凄淸之至、豈知樂華之必敗而恐掃興耶、</p>
<h3>水手之進步</h3>
<p>海軍昨日出戰者、仍爲康衛兩艦、自以一比七敗於樂華後、上星期六、突然以八比四打敗臘克斯、聞者大驚、球藝確已進步多多、昨日在樂華門前機會甚多、脚頭不準、失去無算、</p>
<h3>樂華之零亂</h3>
<p>樂華陣線、昨日欠緊、亦失敗原因、大將相率缺席放假歸去、加入新人不少、聯絡攻射、因此相形減色、結果爲水手所窘、</p>
<h3>失敗之經過</h3>
<p>上半時二比一、海軍佔先、下半時亦二比一、合計成爲四比二、樂華敗北、海軍右内漢生最先射入、樂華右翼陳超、打成平手、史蒂文再中、上半時終結、下半時萬象華得楊人偉來球、造二二再平手、不意海軍連得二球、漢生及考克生、各中一次、四比二完畢、</p>

<h3>關於國貨製造的答案心秀</h3>
<p>吾。國。紗。廠。急。須。自。製。需。要。的。物。件。</p>
<p>我是個國貨紗廠的職員、（現在外貨工廠、喧賓奪主的充滿了國内、所以我加上國貨二字、以資區别、而誌哀痛、）我們廠内一切設備管理、雖然不能說怎樣的完善、却也不是怎樣的腐敗、但我默察現在、顧念將來、深深地覺得若不急謀改良、不但不能發展、怕就像從前的苟延殘喘、也不得了、茲就管見所及、歸納起來、就是應該要有嚴密的組織、完備的設施、寛猛兼濟的管理、機噐固然要求新頴、一工人的技術也要求精進、所謂</p>
<p>設施科學化、工作標準化、技術機械化、而最要緊的根本辦、法應該趕快籌備自己製造物料、如滑機的油啊、拖機的皮帶啊、這兩種物品、看起來雖然是狠小的、但我們自己不能製造、仰賴外貨、一旦不幸發生戰事、或是抵制、來源斷絶、那就要使全部機器因之停止工作、而影響到全廠營業了、這事雖小可以喻大、還有一點、大家應該注意的、我們創辦新式紡織工業以來、也已經有四十多年了、可是共計紡綻、還只二百四十萬枚、所以無錫申新紗廠總理榮氏、爲擴充國内紡織業起見、前曾向政府建議、借用外錠、幾度磋商、政府已允許把庚欵一百三十萬鎊作擔保、向英國借用紡錠六十萬、枚驟然添加原數四分之一、可以增加出產、固然是件幸事、但我們還得設法自己製造、不要永遠倚賴外錠、以免仰外人的鼻息而塞鉅大的漏巵、我國</p>
<p>紗廠當局、應該放開遠大的眼光、來作永久的計劃、若是苟圖僥倖、利用現在抵制日貨的機會、冀獲厚利、只顧目前、而不計及將來、那末恐怕抵制的聲浪一息、我國才呈蓬勃氣象的紗業界、又要頓呈萎靡不振的慘狀了、當然、國貨的製造、不僅紗廠一方面的物料而已、希望凡百工、業所需要的一切原料、和物品、而爲我國所缺乏的、都要大家研究、羣策羣力的各盡其才、各竭其智的合作製造、這樣纔可以談得到根本的提倡的國貨、抵制外貨、願我國人努力、積極的努力罷、（丙）</p>

<h3>日本與中國相煎之一徵</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>日本與吾國同處東亞。考之史。秦始皇二十八年東巡。封泰山。禪梁父。遂游海上。求神仙。及南渡江。東行郡縣。召魯儒生。復至泰山下。議封禪。嗣東游海上。祠山川八神。南登瑯琊。燕人宋無忌羡門子高之徒。稱有仙道。得形解銷化之術。乃使人入海求蓬萊方丈。以及瀛州。云此三神山。在渤海中。諸仙人及不死藥皆在焉。於是有方土徐市（或作福）者上書。請得齋戒。與童男女三千求之。甫入海。船交海中。皆以風爲解。曰『未能至。望見之焉』。然不載其生還。以是後之考求此史蹟者。踵疑莫能信。而三島開山之祖。必屬諸徐氏無疑。</p>
<p>顧考諸日本史籍。亦無紀載。或云因種族關係。恐與彼邦進取前途不利。故遂削之。僅存秘閣中之一種墳典而已。迺前三年余聞諸旅東之某君。則云徐福之墓。確在日之紀州角熊野浦附近之新宮町。其面積極廣。墓碑屹立。古柏參天。圍可合抱。旁有從葬者墓七。皆有碑文可考。散見於紀伊續風土記一書。恨未寓目。故徐氏東渡之詳。訖不得摉采其佚聞。以資傳信。昨於秦君吉了處。乞得海東諸國記一書。中有『始皇好仙方。命徐福率三千童男女。携帶五穀種子。及百工器具。乘船赴蓬萊求之。不得。畏誅。不敢回。時在日本孝靈帝七十二年。遂入日籍』。則徐氏之一去不復返。考之是書。而又益信。</p>
<p>猶憶淸光緒二十六七年間。駐日公使黎庶昌。曾渡海訪其墓穴。並爲文紀之。惜其文今已無從覓得。否則。必能尋其所自。而島夷卉服。首見之禹貢。自漢以後。不聞倭患。蓋以其欲愛鮮華。地多饒沃。五州七道。三島五百七十三郡。率皆樂土。環以瀛海。君臣自保。不愛慕中國。也然研人種學者。以其地同屬亞洲。其膚色又同爲黄種。其姓氏生活習俗。皆與中土無異。唯北海道之蝦夷。絶不相類。則以箕子之封於朝鮮。鄭成功之避居臺灣例</p>
<p>之。亦非無稽。相傳今日人姓秦者。多福之子孫。極繁衍。自明治維新。始易他姓。有藤澤驛福岡平一郎者。爲福之後裔。而和歌山縣著名之醫家徐。某則又亢宗之嫡傳。雖無譜牒可徵。而徐之血　。支庶必多。今之木屐兒忘其所出。而日與吾中國爭衡。不思唇亡則齒。寒唯以侵略爲得計。噫。吾誦『本是同根生。相煎何太急』之句。而不僅爲吾哀。亦復爲彼惜焉。</p>
<h3>馮煥章與蔣介石</h3>
<p>— 自在</p>
<p>馮玉祥與蔣中正。本來是拜把兄弟。其二人之致治黨見主張如何。暫且不談。現祗述其軼聞一二。用供茶餘酒後之談助耳。</p>
<p>蔣馮在鄭州第二次會晤時。馬福祥當時爲馮之親信。見彼二人决意合作。便勸換帖。結爲兄弟。蔣馮首肯。於是交換塡就祖宗三代之金蘭譜。聯爲異姓兄弟。後馬氏辄對人言。「蔣馮之拜把子。是我做媒的。」欣欣然而有喜色。</p>
<p>蔣馮雖結爲兄弟。而馮對蔣文電之稱謂。封套必書鈞啓。上欵必稱總司令鈞鑒。稱呼則鈞座。下欵則自稱職馮玉祥。蔣即去函謙辭。謂彼此誼同手足。不應如此稱呼。此後請仍以兄弟相稱。較爲親切。馮則以公事公辦。不能以私廢公。論私情誼雖兄弟。論職務則上官下屬。不得不如此。旣如是則彼此相約除公事外。仍用鈞職等字。餘則稱介石我弟。小兄祥等。以示區别。而全公私。</p>
<p>當蔣之北上蘭封會馮。請蔣閱軍時。駐蘭封隊伍適爲石友三軍。西北大好隊夙著威名。尤以石軍爲最。軍士刀法純熟。使觀者眼眩神奪。旋又令士官操演上槓術。石友三當塲獻技。卸下軍衣。赤膊上槓。生平絶技。澈底表演。蔣嘖嘖稱羨。蓋石自十六歲即投馮軍。頭腦聰慧。身體矯捷。由當兵而至下級軍官時。考試戰術。辄冠其曹。上槓術爲其絶技。堪稱全軍第一云。</p>

<p>余曩赴張家口時。曾由南口徒步越居庸關。登八達嶺。而抵靑龍橋。作萬里長城游。一日與友人嚴文錦君偕詣李鳳姊墓。履險登危。始達其地。墓在居庸關北口外八達嶺之膂。倚山面谷。白壤瑩然。旁有破屋數椽。皆懷來人移住者。牧羊爲業。據彼土人云。昔有居民三四十户。旗漢參半。後因兵匪相循。多南徙昌平。然頽垣敗瓦。故迹猶存。最奇者。在黛巒墨嶂。横互百里。危巖峭壁。聳峙千尋之中。何來此一坏白土。埋葬芳魂耶。今殘碑斷碣。已不可辨。而土人傳言。均謂墓本黄土。因遭雷殛。遽變白脂。後人咸斥爲妄。並謂鳳姐當時與帝同駕還京。而正史又以涉及顚倒予奪亦不載錄。故後人無由判其眞膺。惟野叟奇談中。有述明正德游龍戲鳳韻事。足證鳳姐中途暴卒則八達嶺上之墓。其爲鳳姐也無疑。當明宸濠反叛。御駕親征。途次宣化。帝微服外行。驟見一酒肆中。有一女子。年可十五六。風神綽約。審諦之。情益顚倒。帝見肆中無人。入肆沽飲。時鳳姐父適在外。由鳳姐當爐。因鳳姐送酒來席。誤認爲娼妓之流。神魂搖蕩。突起擁抱。鳳姐驚喊。帝掩其口曰。朕爲天子。苟從我。富貴可立至。先是。鳳姐夜夢身變明珠。爲蒼龍繞戲。驟化烟雲而散。聞帝言頓悟。任帝闔户。而羅襦衿解。儼然處子。帝大悅。時李父聞喊趨救。門已嚴扃。急奔呼救守備蜂擁而入。疑爲盜焉。及門啓。帝拔劍而立兵士伏謁。叱令將鳳姐歸豹房。爵其父三品卿。賜黄金千兩。欲封鳳姐爲嬪妃。命其自擇。鳳姐固辭不受。帝覩其衣玄裳。益顯嬌媚。故不强易宮裝。後帝欲與鳳姐並輿還京。駕至居庸關。風雷交作。鳳且目覩關口所鑿四大石像。面目生動。眩暈墜馬。帝親扶之。疾外退。駐蹕行宮。鳳姐自知福薄。不能傳宮禁。勸帝速回。帝不忍棄。鳳姐哀慟而絶。帝命葬於關山之上。寵以殊禮。用黄土土塋。一夜盡變爲白脂。蓋陰靈猶不敢受也。此雖爲燕書　說之言。然今日親登八達嶺謁鳳姐墓者。咸信山東李白而嗟其出處無訛也。况正史亦載帝在豹房。百官交章勸諫。皆不納。旋暴卒途中。至梨園以父誤兄。是不可考已。</p>
<h3>倭刀瑣話</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>倭人尙武好殺。常以倭刀爲佩。有大小二種。大者謂之太刀。小者謂之脇差。趙宋間。倭人曾以入貢。歐陽永叔有日本刀歌。傳誦於世。據倭志籍。製刀之術。始於平安朝。（當我國唐代）至承平天慶。（當五代時）其制始精。宇多天皇時。（當元世祖時）有吉光正中二匠尤著名。不啻我國造劍之干將莫邪也。茲右刀已罕見。皇家常以之爲饙贈之品。猶憶曩歲倭皇贈我蔣中正氏倭刀一柄。今未知是刀尙存否。深願氏之慷慨誓師。直抵夷島。即以其刀。還殲其人之爲快也。</p>
<p>故文學家畢幾庵光緒宮詞。若干首之一云。瓊簫銀管唱金丹。妙舞淸歌動聖顏。太息倭刀留恨事。櫻桃憔悴落人間。末附識語。章鑑翠娛堂詩話云。德宗頗賞識優人余莊兒。在大内演十粒金丹新劇。未解妝。德宗召之殿内。携手顧后曰。此子可稱文武全才。后以其近御座。將訴之西后。帝懼。乃以余所佩倭刀爲眞者。將律以御前持械罪。揮之出曰。送刑部。余遂報故不復召。有詠其事云。殿前歌舞鄭櫻桃。十粒金丹别調高。畢竟聖明持大體。曲欄花下解倭刀。此一段宮闈故事。涉及倭刀。倍覺嫵媚。</p>
<p>倭之武士道。實起始於源賴朝。懼平氏末流之陷於柔道弱。於是提倡尙武。習種種武術。名遂大著。直至於今。皇家仍有蓄武士道以自衛者。每年舉行比賽一次。得勝者。衆餽金以禮之。可以致富。武士道大都擅内功。與之搏。不能掣其肘。否則運氣之餘。所掣之手不能脫。或爪甲脫指而反之。痛極自踣。使弄倭刀。尤爲武士道之絶技。某名流旅倭時。竹枝詞有仗有倭刀喚國魂之句。蓋紀實也。</p>
<h3>故都見聞錄</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>奇鐘</p>
<p>西淸華記云。「交泰殿大鐘宮中咸以爲準殿三間。東間設刻漏一座幾滿。日運水斛許。貯其中乾隆以來久廢不用西間則大鐘所在。高大如之。躡梯而上啟鑰上弦。一月後始再啟之。數十年無少差。聲遠直達乾淸門外。猶萬歷時舊製也」又云。「内府有一鐘。下格有一銅人。長四五寸許。屈一足跽。前承以沙盤。鐘鳴時铜人則一手執管於盤中劃沙作天下太平四字。鐘聲寂而書亦竟矣。聞亦利馬　初來時所製者。</p>
<p>往時讀此記載。輒以爲誕。今故宮開放。内府球圖之珍無不披露。始知沈氏實據所目覩而言也。交泰殿本貯藏寳壐之所。平日絶不御幸。故殿中足有餘以庋大鐘。國中時鐘。之大而且古者。殆無與比矣至古物陳列所武英殿所藏舊鐘表之珍異者。尤不可勝計民國十七年。曾覓内府造辦處老工師一一修復其機件以之列演。皆有可觀中有一具。每屆鐘鳴。則匣門自啟。晶沙交流。蔽蔽有聲。儼若瀑泉。旣而枝上鳥鳴。嚶婉可聽。振翼飛過别枝。復引吭良久始歇。其工巧殆非人力餘亦類比。舊人傳說嘉道間粤東某督覓工製機。出一人執筆書萬壽無疆四字。擬獻宮中。以吝於使費。爲内豎所詰。云設使其機書至無字突然而壞。禍且不測。某督遂懼而止。彼時機工專注意於玩好之物如此。宜乎老輩力詆西人之奇技淫巧矣。</p>
<p>乾隆甲申。西洋某國貢銅鈴十八人。能演西廂一部。人長尺許。身軀耳目手足悉以銅鑄。心腹賢腸皆用開鍵凑結。如自鳴鐘每齣插匙開鎖有定程。誤開則坐臥行止辭矣。張鶯紅娘惠明法聰諸人能由開箱加衣。身段交接揖讓進退儼然如生。惟不能歌耳一　畢。自脫衣臥箱中。臨値塲中。自行起立仍立。於毯此某筆記所載也。今故宮無此物。故宮所藏鐘表多英國十七世紀製品。有製造廠家標識。不徒以裝綴華珍音奏諧美見長。其機件之精確歷久不差舛。亦今日所無。此外世家舊族所藏。正復不尠。其小者固多流落市廛。其重不可致者尙所在有之。吾意有癖此者。能網羅之撰一故都鐘譜必極可傳。又都人呼表亦曰鐘。亦沿自古昔也。</p>

<p>魏卓謀碰了一鼻子灰。略停了一停。仍復沉住了氣。像戲白上道白一般。怪聲怪調的問道。喂呀。我看你今天有什麽很沉重的心思。吧閒暇無事。待我來猜上一猜。隨又搔首抓腮。另來了一套細緻的做工。才哦哦連聲的又道。我一猜就猜着了。且先問問你。安玉田這兩天來過了没有。你怕是在想念他吧。梁笑雲轉過臉兒來道。你又在這裏胡猜一氣。我平白想念他幹什麽。只是這幾天他的確未曾來。我們說正經的。你究看見過他嗎。可知道他爲什麽事好幾天不出門。魏卓謀笑道。你怎麽能料定他是好幾天没出門。難道你這兒他幾天不曾來。他就不作興到别的地方去嗎。這一個反問。問得伊啞口無言。還有點兒羞臊。使粉頰上陡湧起微微一陣燥熱。便更爲嬌嗔着道。我不來。你這人太可恶了。我原是很正經的向你探聽他。你怎麽竟與我過不去。我不同你說啦。你請走吧。魏卓謀笑道。我不能走。他的事還焆有我知道得最詳細。我今天到這兒來。就是你不向我打聽。我本預備在課後對你說一說的。如今你惱了我。我郤又不能隨便的就詳細告訴你。姑且先露一點風。他出了一大亂子啦這個亂子還是頂大。不獨不得了。而且了不得。欲知後事如何。且聽下回分解。你旣然不高興同我說話。我就不必再說下去。對不起。我向你告假。我就走啦。决用不着你再來鬨。說罷。抄起一部書。果然立起來裝做邁步要走的樣子。急得伊趕忙一手將他拉住。跌跌脚道。得啦。你這位俏皮的先生。不要再裝作勢。緊急不啦。謝謝你。他究鬧了什麽大亂子。要緊不要緊。快快告訴我罷。魏卓謀說着要走。本是鬧着玩的。自然就穏定了身體。徐徐說道。看你急成這副形象。可見你眞是關切他呢。我若照實把他這悉不幸的大禍事說出來。倒有些怕你驚嚇不起。然而你要苦苦問我。我又那能不說。没法子。請你定一定神。放大了膽聽吧。梁笑雲忽然挿嘴道。你說得這般可怕。我想起來了。他前回來這裏。說有點頭痛莫非他眞病倒了嗎。魏卓謀忙搖手道。不是的。你不要打岔。他身體怪結實的。點把你病難不倒他。你瞎灼急點什麽。這回他的禍事比一切都重大呢。我與他是同鄉。他老家裏的事。我全曉得。他有老年的父母在堂。又還有一個弱小的兄弟。　他一人　　劉　。　餘家族　在老家　。</p>

<h3>日輪復興與華員被排幸</h3>
<p>據十四日本報載：在華日輪，自九一八事變以來，幾全數受抵制之打擊而輟業停班。長江一路，原有日輪二十餘艘，减至三輪，仍都航空班；日郵船會社中日一路，共有四條航線，有九輪開行，生意極佳，每月客票一項，亦有九萬至十萬的收入，去年十月十一月，每月僅收一萬二三千元，較平時跌落十分之八。但最近以來，我國排貨運動鬆懈，長江日輪復乘機减低輪價百分之五十，於是出口貨物頓時激增，每次往來三特艙均皆擠滿。而中日一路，營業收入，也突然曾加，上月份由一萬餘元增至四萬元左右。</p>
<p>又據十五日本報載：大連灣日本商輪已經會議，自本月份起决計將各船所用中國水手生火等一律停歇失業人數，至少在千名以上。另外更有一個奇離的消息，我國政記輪船公司，總理張政本忽不顧一切，將所有二十三輪的高級船員，盡易日人，並呈請交通部，謂中國航員人材缺乏，非用日人不可，要求發給日人船主執照。</p>
<p>我們將上面兩則新聞對照看過以後，眞是欲哭無淚，東北失地還未恢復，錦州最近又告陷落，敵騎正咆哮而西來，而我們曾經一時激昻蹈厲的民氣，又入於睡眠狀態了，第八次的排斥日貨運動，又將告一結束了，反之，日人且正將我國的船員完全解雇，誰排誰呢？誰是最後的勝利者呢？日人譏刺我們的排貨運動爲「小兒病」，又說「一次排貨之後日貨的銷額，必反而激增」，我們眞被人家看透了，你不爭氣的民族呀，當你手中最後僅存的武器被敵人奪去以後，究將何以自存呢？</p>
<p>至於政記輪船公司經理甘心認賊作父，心已死盡，更復何說，即寸磔之，當亦不足以蔽其辜。</p>
<p>國人啊，爲自救計，爲救國計，我們忍心放棄我們手裏最後僅存的自衛武器嗎？</p>

<h3>死灰復燃</h3>
<p>— 陶小桃</p>
<p>死灰復燃是一個養氣的把戲。牠可以使吹滅的火復燃。我們旣然要實騐這個養氣的把戲，對於養氣的歷史也該知道一點。</p>
<p>養氣相傳是英人普利斯特利氏（Ｊoseph　Priestley)發見的。他在１７７４年把紅色養化銾（即三仙丹）加熱而得這種氣體。但在普氏之先，有一瑞典化學家社勒氏（Ｓcheele)實在是養氣發明之第一人。</p>
<p>社勒發明養氣用的材料是二氣化錳，我們也可以來幹他一次。你取一個實騐管，管的四面要用布擦乾，以防燒炸。實騐管中放二氣化錳，和氧酸鉀各一匙，管口塞一軟木塞，軟木塞的中間，鑽一個和玻璃管般大的洞插一根變曲玻璃管。次取一個臉盆（或玻璃缸）臉盆中放大半盆水，</p>
<p>再取玻璃杯一個，中間放滿陰，水倒放在臉盆水中。次把變曲玻璃管在實騐管外面的一頭放在玻璃杯底。次把酒精燈點着燒那實騐管管中的二氣化錳，和氮酸鉀起了化學作用，把一種氣體吐了出來，只見玻璃杯中冒氣泡。這氣泡。就是氧氣泡，一個個的往玻璃杯中跑，玻璃杯中的水被養氣漸漸壓了下來。</p>
<p>等到杯中的水一起被壓出來的時候，你用一根鐵絲繫着一根洋火把洋火點着，一面把杯拿出來，一面把洋火吹熄凑火柴頭還紅時急速放進杯中去，只見洋火又燒了起來把鐵絲都燒紅了。牠發出來的火比從前點着的火還要大，一直燒到火柴没有了爲止。</p>
<p>這個實騐證明養氣有助燃性。你們做這個實騐，要做得很快才能得到很好的結果。這個實騐只要化二三角錢便可以做成功。</p>
<p>這養氣和空氣中之養氣是一樣的。空氣中有十分之二爲養氣。火在空氣中燒得着也就是因爲有養氣的緣故。</p>

<h3>生活方洗種種（四）杏子</h3>
<p>讀者諸君有點閒暇的時間嗎？倘使你有點閒暇，不妨作一個臨時「馬路巡閱使」，視察一週就可以使你發現許多貧苦的良善百姓的生活計。</p>
<p>俗話說得好：「人無生活計，吃盡斗量金」，何况那些貧苦的良善小百姓，旣没有斗量金可以坐吃現成，又没有銅筋鐵骨去當苦力，他們也不甘心爲非作歹，在罪惡滔天的上海灘上，不騙，不偷，不掠，不刦，却也難爲了他們，他們靠了十個指頭糊住一張嘴·這種良善百姓也値得我們一談。</p>
<p>有一天在北四川路橋看見一個臉色焦黄的同胞，站在郵政局的高牆下曬太陽懷中挾着一隻森匣，上面挿滿了竹製的挖耳搔癢，和洗頭的小竹器，他的手中正在削一枝細小的竹籤，挖耳一枝値銅元二枚，洗頭竹箆一個値銅元四枚至六枚，好奇心使我開始問他：</p>
<p>『儂格生意好嗎？』</p>
<p>他很稀奇地瞅了我一眼，並没有答覆我。可是「打破沙鍋問到底」的我，還是要問第二句：</p>
<p>『儂一天好賣幾多銅鈿』</p>
<p>『好呢，可賣幾隻角子，不好就只有幾個銅板』。他很安閑地說。</p>
<p>『幾隻角子夠吃嗎？』</p>
<p>『不夠吃又那樣呢！有銅鈿格用錢賺錢，綁票格用性命賺錢，阿儂這行生意，有吃就吃，没吃就餓。』</p>
<p>他這幾句話倒是本心話，可是我却覺得他是在教訓我了。</p>

<h3>五元一天的亭子樓雯卿</h3>
<p>我的同學好友周女·士因了家庭的慘變環境的壓迫，中途輟了學，她離開上海，飄泊到他方去謀生活，差不多有兩年了。現在又重來海上，想找一個學校繼續她的學業。她在</p>
<p>以前住熟了的一個弄裏，找了一間亭子樓，做暫時安身的處所。</p>
<p>她剛剛把行李搬進了樓房，那房東太太就催她繳五元房租。她把行李整理淸楚了·房子裏的電燈也開了。正安安靜靜地坐在床沿上休息房東太太又走進來了·</p>
<p>「小姐·請你出去找保人吧！」房東太太說：</p>
<p>「找什麽保人？」她很詫異的睜着眼睛望着房東太太說：</p>
<p>「現在住華界的房子，要有擔保人才行。若是今天你不找保人到公安局去具保單，他們來查着了，一定要處罰的」。房東太太又說·</p>
<p>「我是讀書的人·在這裏住不得多少時候，就要搬到學校裏去的。在上海我一個人也不認識，到那裏去找保人哩！那末，要保人，就請你保吧。」她又說：</p>
<p>「本來，做别的生意的人，二房東是可以到公安局去具保單的。因爲你是學生，在學生中不安分的人很多··所以公安局一定要舖保的·」房東太太說</p>
<p>「學生又不是洪水猛獸，眞討厭，在上海居住的自由都没有了！」她又詫異地說：</p>
<p>到了這個時候要她找舖保的事，眞是爲難。如不找舖保，公安局又要處罰，没有辦法只得想再搬回旅館去·於是和房東太太交涉，要她退還房租。但房東太太聽了她要還五元房租的話，馬上就變了面色說：</p>
<p>「上海交了房租，没有退出來的規矩。」她和房東太太爭辯了許久，但始終没有結果。周女士氣得面紅耳赤，她一面痛恨那婦人㚥險狡詐一面又恨執政的當局没有根本的方法來維持社會的治安，害得一些行人旅客左右爲難。</p>
<p>時候很晚了，她冒險地在亭子樓過了一夜：第二天早上，她又把行李束裝起來·呌了一部黄包車，一直往她先住過的那旅館裏去了。</p>

<p>Ｘ現在的英領事館址</p>
<p>英領事巴爾福原來原在上海縣城内，這時候，急於想在租界以内購買地皮重建新署。但是按照當時英國政府的法律，凡駐外領事不得購買地土建築公署，僅只可以租借駐在國的房屋作爲館址。然而英領巴爾福竟不顧本國的法律，在膽在租界内覓得土地建造領事署。</p>
<p>在一八四六年四月二十八日，巴爾福在英租界北首購得黎姓地皮一塊，共計百畝，地價一萬七千元，因爲未得英政府之許可·巴爾福自行墊欵四千元。五月之後，巴爾福卸任，由阿爾苛克（Ｒutherfkrd　Alcock)繼任領事，接事之後經過許多困難，始得英政府批准承認購置領事館所費的置價。英領事館的新址始得確定，至一八四九年七月二十一日，英領事始由城内遷入租界内新址。</p>

<p>Japanese Third Route Army Driven Back by Our Forces at Xinqiu</p>
<p>Xinmin Volunteers Retreat After Night Attack by Japanese Troops</p>
<p>Japanese Marines Land at Qinhuangdao, Opening Yuguan</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army invaded Rehe in three routes. The third route entered Fuxin from Xinlitun and advanced towards Xinqiu. It was jointly repelled by the 3rd Cavalry Brigade and volunteer forces. The main force of this Japanese route was the Murai Brigade. Although its strength was formidable, it was unfamiliar with the terrain and found it difficult to advance. Our army held a more advantageous position. The cavalry regiment and air squadron of the Suzuki Brigade were advancing to join the main forces on the Kailu and Suidong routes. The volunteer forces in the Datong Line and Jinxi areas offered strong resistance, temporarily delaying the advance. Another detachment engaged the enemy, while some utilized Mongol bandits as internal collaborators. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) A Japanese newspaper reported that Rehe Province must be captured in order to end military operations in Manchuria. (Fifteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese troops attacking Jinxi were mainly from the Yoda Brigade, with support from detachments such as Tsuranami, Sakurai, and Hirata, as well as an independent air squadron. They ravaged every village and town they passed through, indiscriminately massacring innocent civilians, resulting in numerous deaths. (Fifteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) A certain mixed brigade of the Jinzhou army made contact with friendly forces near Renyitun at 3:30 PM on the 14th. Their vanguard cavalry arrived in Jinxi at 5:30 PM that afternoon. (Fifteenth dispatch from Japanese Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese have been continuously transporting large numbers of troops from Shenyang to Jin to attack the Jinxi volunteer army. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) A large number of Chinese troops appeared at the Baimiaozi Station on the Beining Line and were subsequently driven back by Japanese armored vehicles. (Fifteenth dispatch from Japanese Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Xinmin volunteer army was subjected to a large-scale attack by the Japanese Miyazaki unit on the night of the 14th. After a long and bloody battle, the volunteer army retreated. Japanese troops have heavily fortified Xinmin City both inside and outside. Mail to the three northeastern provinces is now routed by sea via Dalian, according to a postal service announcement today. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Volunteer forces are very active on both flanks of the Jinbei and Ning lines. The Muro Division headquarters and the Himeji Brigade of the New Army will challenge them. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Army Chief of Staff in Tianjin, Takeichi, returned to Tianjin by train at noon. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) More than forty Japanese naval marines landed at Qinhuangdao and opened Yuguan last night. Japanese planes were scouting in areas such as Huangdi and Zhaoyang Temple. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Transport Unit Annihilated in Jinxi Area</h3>
<p>Thirty-Two People, None Survived</p>
<p>(Shenyang) According to information received here, a Japanese transport unit of thirty-two men, led by Quartermaster Matsuo, was ambushed en route to resupply Jinxi one week ago. As the transport unit was returning to Jinzhou from Jinxi, thousands of bandits were attacking Jinxi. The transport unit was ambushed between Jinzhou and Jinxi by 300 bandits. All thirty-two members of the team were killed. Also, according to news from Jinzhou, the bodies of these Japanese soldiers were burned, leaving no trace. (Sixteenth dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Jinzhou) The Japanese supply transport unit commanded by Lieutenant Matsudaira, after delivering military provisions to the Koga Regiment a few days ago, was ambushed by 300 Chinese soldiers at Dujiatun on its return to Jinzhou, and contact was lost. It is reported that the unit fought hard against the intense fire from Chinese machine guns and rifles, but they were outnumbered and overwhelmed, resulting in the complete annihilation of the thirty-two men. However, their bodies have not yet been found. The Japanese suspect that the Chinese army burned them and are currently investigating the truth. (Fifteenth dispatch from Japanese Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>(Jinxi) The remains of Lieutenant Colonel Koga and fifteen others who died in battle in Jinxi were cremated at a vacant lot in the city at 1:00 PM on the 15th. (Fifteenth dispatch from Japanese Allied News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Completely Withdraw from Suizhong</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese troops have completely withdrawn from Suizhong, and passenger trains can now travel to Suizhong. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the 14th, approximately one battalion of Japanese troops from the Yu, Kai, Jin, and Chao lines stayed overnight in Suizhong. They advanced on the morning of the 15th, and in the afternoon, over a hundred people returned to replace them. An armored train stationed in Suizhong returned to Jin on the 15th. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<h3>Employees of the Beining Railway Terminate Service Outside the Pass</h3>
<p>Three Conditions Presented to the Railway Bureau</p>
<p>(Beiping) Employees of the Beining Railway who were dispatched to stations outside the pass yesterday, stopped midway due to the ongoing atrocities committed by Japanese troops east of Suizhong and the extreme danger of the journey ahead. They will only proceed after the Railway Bureau reaches a compromise with the Japanese side and ensures the safety of all employees. The Railway Bureau has dispatched a foreign employee to negotiate with the Japanese side again. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Employees of the Beining Railway outside the pass presented three conditions to the Railway Bureau: 1. The safety of employees outside the pass must be guaranteed, and the Railway Bureau outside the pass must have concrete measures in place to respond to incidents; 2. Year-end bonuses from last year, wartime service bonuses, and special allowances for losses incurred by railway staff for the four months after September must be paid; 3. Senior officials must be assigned to lead the service outside the pass. The Railway Bureau is currently discussing these conditions.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday afternoon, the train from Yu to Kai to Jin experienced a delayed departure of one hour because railway workers competed to board the train to Tianjin and petitioned the general bureau. Eventually they were persuaded to stop. After the train departed, five Japanese soldiers issued a warning to Section Chief Chen, claiming that, according to the Boxer Protocol, he was obstructing the train. Section Chief Chen replied that the train's delay could not be considered an obstruction. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Over one hundred employees of the Beining Railway Bureau outside the pass boarded train number 102 last night and returned west. The Railway Bureau sent staff to dissuade them, but they were unsuccessful. Two individuals took the initiative to remain. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Enter Shulan City</h3>
<p>Japanese Air Squadrons Assist in the Attack on Yushu</p>
<p>(Harbin) Ten Japanese planes from Changchun, divided into two squadrons, flew to Shulan to cover the rebel army's attack on Yushu. One Japanese plane flew from Hei via Harbin to Changchun this afternoon. (Fifteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Japanese troops advanced from Jilin towards Shulan to attack Zhang Zuozhou's forces. The battle was quite fierce, and Japanese troops have already entered the city. Japanese planes have been bombing Yushu for days, causing many casualties among soldiers and civilians. (Fifteenth dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jilin Provincial Government Prepares to Relocate to Yilan</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinghui Serves as Mediator</p>
<p>Cheng Yun Unwilling to Compromise</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Jilin Provincial Government in Bin County appointed Li Shuzi as a representative to negotiate a peace agreement. Zhang Jinghui's mediation proposal for the conflict between Jilin and Bin includes: 1. Dividing Jilin Province into two zones, Jilin and Bin, and implementing separate governance; 2. Averaging the collection of taxes to temporarily maintain the status quo; 3. No interference in each other's politics. Xi Qia's representative, Jin Wuxuan, has telegraphed Xi for instructions. Cheng Yun, Acting Chairman of the Bin Provincial Government, advocated for relocating the provincial government to Yilan and is unwilling to compromise. He continues to order his troops to defend key locations. Zhang Zuoxiang has yet to send instructions. (Fifteenth dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Conduct Review in Heihe</h3>
<p>Compromise Between Ma and Zhang Still Not Reached</p>
<p>(Harbin) The commander of the 8th Mixed Brigade of the Japanese Army, Suzuki, arrived in Heihe on the 14th. On the 15th, the Japanese troops in Heihe held a review, and important Chinese officials were forced to attend. (Fifteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to Japanese sources, a compromise between Ma Zhanshan and Zhang Jinghui has not yet been reached. The original agreement was for Zhang to be the Chairman of Heilongjiang Province and Ma to be his deputy. Both were required to formally assume their positions in Heihe, but this did not happen. The Japanese attributed this to disruption by student and Kuomintang propaganda. They allege this compromise was agreed upon by the Japanese. However, the only Kuomintang branch in Manchuria is the Harbin branch, which may now be closed. Japanese sources have repeatedly stated that Chinese local officials are about to close it, and there may be reason for this belief as the Japanese dislike their anti-Japanese propaganda.

<h3>Japanese Reply to the U.S. Note</h3>
<p>Justifying Actions Based on the Unsettled Chinese Political Situation</p>
<p>Attempting to Evade Responsibilities Under the Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<p>Conclusion Contains Subtle Sarcasm Towards the U.S.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, the new Foreign Minister Yoshizawa delivered a response to the U.S. note concerning the Nine-Power Treaty obligations to U.S. Ambassador Forbes. The wording of the response is reassuring, but delivered with cold politeness. The final sentence reads: "It is trusted that the U.S. government, with its friendly spirit, will have a correct understanding of the situation." This sentence likely contains dissatisfaction with the U.S. action. The main points of the response are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Reiterates commitment to the Open Door Policy in Manchuria, but regrets that the unstable conditions in China have greatly reduced the effectiveness of this policy.</p>
<p>2.  Acknowledges that the U.S. cannot recognize the legality of any events that damage its treaty rights or that arise from methods not permitted by the Kellogg-Briand Pact.</p>
<p>3.  The current unstable state in China was not anticipated by the powers when they signed the treaties in Washington. While the binding nature of the treaty provisions cannot be affected, in practice, this situation may alter the application of the treaty provisions because the provisions must be applied in light of the current state of affairs.</p>
<p>4.  Any changes in the Manchurian administration are due to the fact that local officials have largely fled or resigned, making it necessary for others to assume their duties to maintain local security.</p>
<p>5.  Japan does not harbor territorial ambitions or designs in Manchuria, and this need not be stated again. However, the U.S. must understand that the security and peace of Manchuria, and the conditions there that benefit general trade, are matters of great concern to the Japanese people and are regarded as extremely important events. (Sixteenth dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's reply to the U.S. was sent out at 11:30 AM this morning, and the Foreign Ministry simultaneously released its contents. Japan repeatedly reiterated its respect for the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, reaffirming its commitment to the Open Door Policy in Manchuria, but expressing regret that the instability in Manchuria and Mongolia has prevented the realization of the benefits of the Open Door Policy. The most unreasonable part of the reply is the claim that any treaties involving all of China should be considered in light of the current political changes in China, stating that the unrest in China in recent years was not foreseen at the Washington Conference when the Nine-Power Treaty was concluded. Furthermore, it sophistically claims that Japan is not responsible for the changes in the Manchurian and Mongolian Chinese government organs, attributing them to the people of the three northeastern provinces forming an independent government on their own. It also repeatedly declared that Japan has no territorial ambitions in Manchuria and Mongolia, only seeking peace and tranquility in the region, as well as opportunities for free trade and economic development. (Sixteenth dispatch from National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The draft of Japan's reply was completed a week ago, but its issuance was delayed until Yoshizawa's return to the country. The content of the Japanese reply reportedly does not acknowledge that Japan's military actions in the three northeastern provinces violate international treaties and agreements, and it strongly maintains the necessity of its occupation of Jinzhou. The original U.S. note was issued on January 8th and sent to both China and Japan. China's reply was delivered a few days ago, expressing strong support for the U.S. action and indicating its willingness to have the U.S. continue its efforts to maintain the dignity of international treaties to restrain Japan's acts of aggression in China. (Sixteenth dispatch from National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Japan Expresses to Britain</h3>
<p>Guaranteeing the Open Door Policy in the Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>Britain Adopts a Non-Interventionist Stance</p>
<p>(London) Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira today conveyed to the British government at the Foreign Office the Japanese government's guarantee that Japan has no territorial ambitions in Manchuria. When the U.S. government sent a note to Japan asking it to pay attention to its obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty, Britain asked Japan to reaffirm that Japan had no territorial ambitions, would respect the Open Door Policy in Manchuria, and would respect the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty. Matsudaira's response today declared that Japan's policy on the aforementioned points has not changed. (Fifteenth dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) It is generally expected here that, given the Japanese Ambassador's assurances, Britain will likely take no further action on the Liaoning issue before the League of Nations Council reconvenes in Geneva. (Fifteenth dispatch from National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Many prominent Japanese figures now believe that the main military operations in Manchuria have been completed and that the construction phase is about to begin. However, the bandit attacks on small detachments of soldiers over the past week suggest that the Japanese army still needs to engage in the work of suppressing banditry. Bandit activity is rampant throughout Manchuria, and victories often go to the bandits because of their unpredictable movements, simple organization, and cavalry units that can exploit the weaknesses of the Japanese army, launching surprise attacks. The Japanese army in Manchuria, therefore, requested that three more divisions be dispatched to Manchuria. Reliable sources indicate that the Japanese government may not approve this request. At the same time, Honjo's forces are now focused on bandit suppression, especially in the areas of Xinmin and Jinxi, and have ordered the new Manchurian government to adopt a similar plan to restore peace. According to the Japanese, Japan is not very concerned about what kind of political system the Manchurian government will adopt, as long as it can guarantee peace and order and allow Japan to exercise its legitimate rights. However, recent statements from influential Japanese figures suggest that Japan has the intention of adopting a Monroe Doctrine in Manchuria. In its reply to Britain's request for guarantees on the Open Door Policy in Manchuria, it expressed gratitude for Britain's non-interventionist attitude, while its reply to the U.S. note contained counter-requests, which seemed to assure people that Japan would apply the Monroe Doctrine to Manchuria. (Sixteenth dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>China Reports the Bombing of Bin County by Japanese Planes to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese government today sent a letter to the League of Nations Secretariat reporting the bombing of Bin County by Japanese planes on January 10th, stating that this action is a serious violation and contempt of the League of Nations Council resolution. (Sixteenth dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<h3>Restoration Sentiment High Again in the Shenyang Area</h3>
<p>Fake Provincial Government Convenes Important Meeting</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reports from Shenyang, the fake Liaoning Provincial Government convened an important meeting starting on the 16th to discuss the issue of establishing a constitutional monarchy and restoring Puyi to the throne. The meeting will last for half a month. Zheng Xiaoxu, Jin Liang, and others have traveled from Pangangzi to Shenyang. It is unknown whether Puyi will come, as the Japanese are keeping it strictly secret. Zang Shiyi, Xi Qia, Jin Liang, Jin Bidong, and others have long had a tacit understanding about the restoration, but they fear falling into the Korean trap and being condemned by the world. Therefore, they are holding a meeting under a false pretense to deliberate on the conditions for a long time. Most of the secret treaties in the Northeast were concluded during the late Qing Dynasty, and it would be simpler to reaffirm them after the restoration than to use other methods.

<p>Travels to Europe by Ship from New York</p>
<p>(Washington) Chinese Minister Yen Hui-ching took an express train to New York tonight to travel to Europe by ship to replace Shi Zhaoji at the League of Nations Council meeting. He will also lead the Chinese delegation to the Disarmament Conference, which will open on February 2nd. Before departing, Yen stated that when the League of Nations Council reconvenes on the 25th of this month to discuss the Liaoning issue, China will reiterate its demand for the fulfillment of League of Nations obligations and respect for the sanctity of various peace treaties. He stated that the Chinese do not want to ask other countries to fight for China, but will ask whether they are willing to abide by the treaties they have signed. Yen also discussed the Japanese government's claim of a 1905 agreement in which China agreed not to build railways parallel to the South Manchurian Railway, saying that the Japanese demand is based only on the minutes of a meeting, and only on the results of discussions at the time about the construction of railways adjacent to the South Manchurian Railway. Regarding rumors that China would invoke Article 16 of the League of Nations Charter to impose economic sanctions on Japan, Yen declined to comment. (Fifteenth dispatch from National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army Officers Request Air Support in Battle</h3>
<p>(Beiping) All officers of the Second Route of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army issued a circular telegram requesting that aircraft be sent to assist in the battle.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Standing Committee Holds Closed-Door Meeting</h3>
<p>Ministers Attend and Report on the Political Situation</p>
<p>Lengthy Discussion of Policy Towards Japan</p>
<p>Wei Tingsheng Criticizes Suspension of Interest Payments on Public Debt</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 175th plenary session on the morning of the 16th. After Chairman Tan Zhen approved the regulations for levying business taxes in the four provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, and Henan, and the detailed rules for implementation, he instructed all visitors to leave the room. Interior Minister Li Wenfan, Vice Foreign Minister Fu Bingchang, and Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan attended and reported on the situation in internal affairs, foreign affairs, and the navy. The finance and military ministers did not attend. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 9:00 AM on the 16th, the Legislative Yuan held its 175th session. At 9:30 AM, it convened a closed-door meeting. Interior Minister Li Wenfan, Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan, and Vice Foreign Minister Fu Bingchang all attended and reported. First, Fu reported on the progress of foreign affairs and the policies adopted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Next, Li reported that the National Crisis Conference has been scheduled to convene on the 25th. Then, Chen reported on the recent state of the navy. Many members spoke about the policies adopted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs towards Japan and the issue of severing diplomatic relations. Wei Tingsheng stated that the government's adoption of the policy of suspending the payment of principal and interest on domestic debt was based on flawed theories, creating a major economic crisis and was inappropriate. He argued that there were alternative solutions to the financial problems and listed figures to prove his point. By 12:15 PM, Chairman Tan Zhen stated that today was for the administrative authorities to report and there was no need for debate. He scheduled another meeting for next Tuesday and adjourned the session. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tan Zhen, Acting President of the Legislative Yuan, spoke about this morning's meeting, stating that administrative authorities were specifically invited to attend to exchange views on foreign affairs and financial issues. If the government does not have extraordinary strategies to usher in a new situation, it will be difficult to overcome this crisis. Tan stated that he does not advocate severing diplomatic relations with Japan, and expressed disapproval of domestic bankers, also advocating for the suspension of principal and interest payments on public debt. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Legislative Yuan member stated that the meeting today did not allow for a clear understanding of the actual situation because no military or financial representatives attended. New plans are also difficult to complete at this time. Another meeting has been scheduled for next Tuesday. China has more than 80 divisions in its standing army, with over a million soldiers. During this Japanese seizure of the three northeastern provinces, no one except Ma Zhanshan has been heard of resisting, and no supporting troops have been seen going to help. In this situation, having many soldiers is equivalent to having no soldiers. No military commanders have been heard of formulating military strategies for defense. Financial officials have not begun to reorganize tax revenues, and now they cannot borrow and are at a loss. The diplomatic policy still lacks a clear direction. The people have been running around and crying out for months, but there has been no clear statement from the government. All of the above are symptoms of the current situation. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan will formulate a new strategy based on the current facts and request the government to adopt and implement it. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 16th, Fu Bingchang reported on the progress of foreign affairs at the Legislative Yuan and the current difficulties. He stated that the former Guangzhou government believed that relations with Japan and Russia were the most important for China's foreign affairs. In order to understand Japan's situation with regard to China, it sent people to Japan to solicit the hopes, demands, and goals of various factions towards China as reference points for negotiations and did not sign any secret treaties that would betray the country's interests. The current Executive Yuan is ostensibly responsible for actual administrative responsibilities, but in fact, everything must be determined by the Central Political Committee, so although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has proposals for policy towards Japan, they cannot be implemented without the Committee's decision. It is hoped that the Committee will make a decision soon so that we can comply. He then explained three methods for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to sever diplomatic relations with Japan, which prompted numerous questions from members. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When the Legislative Yuan met today, Vice Foreign Minister Fu Bingchang presented the latest progress in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' handling of diplomatic affairs with Japan, the direction for future progress, and the issue of severing diplomatic relations with Japan for discussion by the General Assembly. The members expressed their opinions one after another, and repeatedly debated the points of interest and harm. The meeting lasted a long time. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>

<p>Important Domestic Telegrams 2</p>
<h3>Special Committee Discusses Suspension of Principal and Interest Payments on Domestic Debt</h3>
<p>It is Generally Hoped That it Will Not be Brought Up</p>
<p>Zhang Jingjiang Assumes the Role of Mediator</p>
<p>Requests the Banking Sector to Raise Funds for Relief</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The issue of suspending principal and interest payments on domestic debt was discussed at the Legislative Yuan meeting this morning, but no decision was made because no responsible official from the Ministry of Finance attended. During the discussion at the Special Committee meeting this afternoon, Zhang Jingjiang assumed the role of mediator and spoke extensively. It has generally been decided that the issue of suspension will not be brought up. However, the government's income, excluding customs duties, is only seven million per month. With customs duties, it is eighteen million. This is only enough to allocate for principal and interest payments on domestic debt. If it is diverted to military and political expenses, the principal and interest payments on domestic debt will inevitably be affected, and banks and pawnshops across the country will be wiped out. As a result of the discussion, political expenses can be drastically reduced to two million. On the military expenditure side, it will be difficult to reduce further due to the resurgence of domestic communists. The Shanghai banks previously agreed to lend five million per month, but this is not enough. We still request that they raise funds to address the issue. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Special Committee held its second meeting at the Foreign Minister's residence at 3:00 PM this afternoon. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A Legislative Yuan member stated that if the suspension of principal and interest payments on domestic debt is implemented, domestic industry and commerce will be completely paralyzed, and tax revenue will also be affected. Moreover, the principal and interest payments on public debt are only sixteen million per month, which is just over one hundred and ninety million per year. There is no need to adopt a suspension approach. We only need to effectively reorganize other expenses to overcome the difficulties. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Diplomatic Plan Proposed by Chen Youren</h3>
<p>Sever Diplomatic Relations with Japan</p>
<p>The Special Committee Sympathizes with the Principle</p>
<p>The Method Still Needs Careful Consideration</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that Chen Youren's new diplomatic plan has three key points: 1. Sever diplomatic relations with Japan; 2. Request the United States to convene a second Washington Conference; 3. Submit Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. Although some prominent figures agreed with the first point, they all advocated for a cautious approach. Chen repeatedly explained at the temporary meeting of the Central Political Committee on the 14th, the first meeting of the Special Committee on the 15th, and the second meeting on the 16th that severing diplomatic relations with Japan is not the same as going to war with Japan, but rather a means of arousing international sympathy. The members of the Special Committee have agreed that the principle can be proposed, but the method must be carefully considered. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japan's reply to the U.S. note was telegraphed by the embassy in Japan and arrived in Nanjing at 4:00 PM on the 16th. At that time, Chen Youren was attending the Special Committee meeting at the Foreign Minister's residence. Upon hearing the news, he left the meeting and rushed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to study the contents. At around 5:00 PM, Gan Jihou translated the Japanese reply into Chinese and personally sent it to the members of the Special Committee for circulation. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A Legislative Yuan member stated that severing diplomatic relations with Japan is not difficult. The difficulty lies in whether there is genuine internal unity and whether there are adequate preparations after the severance of diplomatic relations. This matter is of great importance and should be carefully considered. The member also stated that China's reply to the U.S. note was too vague in content and also contained inappropriate wording.

<h3>Sun Ke Publishes Statement Explaining the Truth of the Guangdong Situation</h3>
<p>Chen Jitang Sends Representatives to Report on Recent Situation</p>
<p>Mei Lehe States that Guangdong and Guangxi Have Not Intercepted Taxes</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 16th, Sun Ke, the President of the Executive Yuan, made a responsible statement to reporters regarding the recent truth of the Guangdong situation as follows: Since the Guangdong side organized the Executive Department, Political Affairs Committee, and Military Branch of the resolution, those concerned about the current situation generally believed that Guangdong and Guangxi were once again splitting from the Central Government, and there were rumors that Guangdong and Guangxi were intercepting customs duties. Public opinion in Beijing and Shanghai, in particular, expressed great consternation. However, to the best of my knowledge, the truth of the Guangdong situation is far less serious than the outside world has reported. The cause of this matter was that the Guangdong Central Party Headquarters and the National Government in Guangdong had not yet been abolished on December 30th and 31st of last year, and had held two joint meetings. At that time, the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee had just concluded, and the unified government had been scheduled to be established on New Year's Day this year. Guangdong believed that, according to the resolutions of the Fourth National Congress held in Guangdong, after the Guangdong Central Party Headquarters and the National Government in Guangdong were abolished, an Executive Department should be established for party affairs, a Political Affairs Committee should be established for political affairs, and a Military Branch should be established for military affairs to implement the principle of shared power and joint governance. However, due to the distance between Beijing and Guangdong, and the fact that most of the Central Committee members from Guangdong went to Beijing to attend the meeting, the members who stayed in Guangdong had little knowledge of the situation of the First Plenary Session. Therefore, they hastily decided to organize three types of institutions, which was not in accordance with the procedures. According to the original agreement of the Shanghai Peace Conference, the resolutions of the Fourth National Congress of both sides should be submitted to the First Plenary Session for handling. During the First Plenary Session, it was decided to transfer the resolutions of both congresses to the Central Standing Committee for handling. Now, the Central Standing Committee is still studying the issues of the Executive Department and the Political Affairs Committee, and has not yet resolved them. Guangdong suddenly announced its establishment, which is legally incomplete. At that time, the Central Committee members from Guangdong in Beijing and Shanghai sent telegrams to the members who stayed in Guangdong, strongly urging them not to do so. Later, they received a reply from the members who stayed in Guangdong, explaining that although the organization of these three types of institutions had been decided, the draft regulations were still submitted to the Central Government for approval. These three institutions are subordinate to the Central Government and are subject to the guidance and supervision of the Central Government, and are not confronting the Central Government. As for the Military Branch, since the Central Government has not established a Military Affairs Commission, it can be abolished and a Pacification Zone can be established according to the precedents of various provinces to be responsible for suppressing bandits in the area. Ten days ago, the Central colleagues discussed a remedial measure for this problem, and in the future, the Central Government can consider the situation and issue separate regulations so that the legal principles and facts can be taken care of, and the unity of the overall situation will not be hindered. Yesterday, I received a telegram from Chen Jitang stating that because the communist scourge in southern Jiangxi has resurfaced, he sent Chief of Staff Miao Peinan to Beijing the day before yesterday to discuss and coordinate the bandit suppression plan with the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, and decided to send troops to Jiangxi to cooperate with the garrison troops in the area to suppress the bandits, which can also prove that Guangdong is not separating from the Central Government. As for the interception of customs duties, Guangdong has never actually implemented it. However, because Guangdong has borne a very heavy burden for the revolution in recent years, it hopes that the Central Government can consider assisting with the bandit suppression expenses. Yesterday, Mei Lehe, the Director-General of Customs, came to see me and reported that since New Year's Day this year, the customs duties of Guangdong and Guangxi have been remitted as usual. It can be seen that the recent rumors from the outside world are exaggerating. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mei Lehe, the Director-General of Customs, came to Beijing on the morning of the 15th to contact the Central Government on tax revenue issues and visited Sun Ke. He reported on the recent situation of tax payment in Guangdong and Guangxi. Since January 1st of this year, there has been no obvious tax interception in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. He completed his official duties and left Beijing by night train on the evening of the 16th to return to Shanghai. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Jitang sent Sun Jiazhe, the Director of the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian Unified Tax Bureau, to Beijing. He visited Sun Ke on the afternoon of the 16th to report on the recent financial situation of Guangdong and Guangxi, and to report on the recent situation of the Guangdong Bureau.

<h3>Hu Hanmin's Residence Discusses the Two Institutions Case</h3>
<p>Chen Ce and Zhang Huichang Strongly Oppose</p>
<p>Xiao Focheng and Deng Zheru Both Arrive in Hong Kong</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xiao Focheng and Lin Yizhong arrived in Hong Kong on the evening of the 15th and went to Stanley to visit Hu, talking for two hours before leaving. On the morning of the 16th, they went to Kowloon to visit Wu, talking for three hours. At 3 pm, a meeting was held at Hu's residence, attended by Xiao, Lin, Wu, Yu, and Zhang Huichang also rushed to attend. Deng Zheru had arrived in Hong Kong on the evening of the 14th, but did not attend the meeting. Guangdong's attitude towards the three institutions, due to the strong opposition of Chen Ce and Zhang Huichang, has decided to make further concessions. It is said that Wu has agreed to take the position of Chairman of Guangdong and will return to the province on the 17th. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>The Central Political Council Did Not Meet Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The temporary meeting of the Central Political Council, which was originally scheduled to be held at 8 am on the 16th, was temporarily postponed because the new foreign policy plan towards Japan was telegraphed to the three standing committee members Jiang, Wang, and Hu for their opinions, but no reply was received.

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Replies to Jinling University Students' Letter</h3>
<p>In Private Capacity, Inconvenient to Meet</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Chiang's reply to the petition group reads: To the students of Jinling University, I have read your letter carefully. The enthusiasm of the students for national affairs is admired by all Chinese people. Zhongzheng is especially moved by the kindness of the students. My personal situation is based on the premise of benefiting the party and the country. I have reported the details in the published talks, and I will never give up the duty of a citizen. However, in my private capacity, it is inconvenient to talk with the students, and I also have no time to meet with you. I especially entrust Comrade Xu Shaodi to convey my humble opinion. I hope you will send representatives to talk. I only hope to tell the students to work hard for the country and take care of themselves. Chiang Kai-shek. The petition group will return to Shanghai and then to Hong Kong on the 18th. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Proposes Civil Servant Protection Act</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Legislative member Peng Yangguang and others, considering that many departments have been reorganized and many civil servants have been changed, especially proposed a civil servant protection plan on the 16th, which was decided to be submitted to the Legislative Committee for review. It is reported that the Legislative Committee will advance the review on the morning of the 18th and submit it to the general meeting for approval before submitting it to the National Government for promulgation and compliance. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Assembly of the Legislative Yuan proposed that the promotion and demotion of civil servants should be different from those of political officials, and there is no need to change with the change of superiors. Since the 18th year of the Republic of China, the appointment and performance evaluation of civil servants have been clearly stipulated by laws and regulations. There are examinations and departments for merit-based promotions and appointments. Now, regardless of diligence or laziness, regardless of the virtuous or the foolish, all are based on the likes and dislikes of the superiors and other relationships, which will only lead to endless disturbances. How can the improvement of civil service examinations and merit-based promotion and appointment institutions be equivalent to being set up in vain? It is proposed to formulate the following plan for your decision: 1. Civil servants shall not be replaced except for incompetence, unsatisfactory performance evaluation, or other circumstances where dismissal is required by law. 2. In the event of the abolition of an institution or the reduction of personnel in various institutions, the personnel to be laid off shall be screened and the best shall be given priority for transfer. 3. If the head of an institution considers it necessary to eliminate subordinate personnel but the performance evaluation period has not yet arrived, he shall request the Examination Yuan to send personnel to jointly inspect the performance. Only those whose performance is unsatisfactory shall be subject to dismissal. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Inauguration of Heads of Capital Garrison and Police</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Qun took office as the head of the Capital Police Department on the morning of the 16th.

<p>(Nanjing) The Second Brigade of the Gendarmerie, Zhang Dingming's unit, has been transferred to Beijing to protect the capital and has arrived. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Strange, the So-Called "Qing-Japan Secret Treaty"</h3>
<p>Japan suddenly launched a violent occupation of my Northeast, seizing half of my country's territory. According to its propaganda, the reason is to maintain its legitimate rights and interests in my Northeast. Under the violent plunder, its so-called "legitimate rights and interests" should now be sufficient to "maintain" and satisfy its imperialist ambition of plunder. But recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs suddenly officially announced the so-called "Qing-Japan Secret Treaty," and said that when China and Japan concluded the treaty and supplementary treaty on the three eastern provinces in December of the 38th year of Meiji (1905), Japan had requested that the binding matters be inserted into the article. The Qing court could not make it public due to internal relations, so it decided not to announce it. This fact is enough to show its insidious means, and it does everything it can. We cannot but give a solemn refutation to this kind of dishonorable behavior in international relations based on the facts.</p>
<p>The Japanese government's intention in announcing this so-called "secret treaty" is to focus on Article 3, which prohibits the laying of railway lines parallel to the South Manchuria Railway. We have found many aspects of evidence to refute the baselessness of this secret treaty. First, Tang Shaoyi, who was one of the secretaries of the Sino-Japanese conference in 1905, once issued a statement on January 28, 1908, when he was the governor of Fengtian, asserting that "there is no agreement prohibiting China from building any parallel lines to the South Manchuria Railway," and said that "there was no secret treaty signed at that time, and the Beijing diplomatic corps should be well aware of this." Tang had already publicly denied it at that time. If there was really such a "secret treaty," why didn't Japan announce it at that time? Second, if this official document is true, why hasn't Japan registered it with the Secretariat of the League of Nations from beginning to end? Nor did it register with the US State Department in accordance with Item 11 of the resolution on the Far East issue at the Washington Conference. Third, when the newly revised treaty and supplementary treaty on the three eastern provinces between China and Japan were exchanged and ratified on January 23, 1906, there was no collateral agreement or other acknowledgment at the same time. Fourth, the issue of the parallel line of the South Manchuria Railway once occurred in the autumn of the 33rd year of Guangxu (1907). At that time, the Ministry of Posts and Communications of the Qing government planned to extend the Guandong Railway from Xinmin to Faku, in preparation for extending it to Taonan and reaching Jiangsu Province. Abe, the acting Japanese minister, heard about it and sent a letter to the Ministry of Posts and Communications to question it, citing the so-called "secret treaty" of the 31st year of Guangxu (1905) as the basis for the protest. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Qing government sent a reply, saying, "Your minister cites the record of the Sino-Japanese conference as the basis, saying that China has disregarded the treaty and has taken actions that infringe on the interests of the South Manchuria Railway. I don't know that when the Chinese and Japanese plenipotentiaries negotiated this article, the Chinese plenipotentiary believed that the scope of the two words 'parallel' was very broad. It must be determined by the number of miles, and it must be clearly stated that the parallel line cannot be built within a certain number of miles. The Japanese plenipotentiary believed that if the number of miles was determined, other countries would inevitably think that there were restrictions on China's road construction. Then, he asked to determine the number of miles between the parallel lines according to European and American practices. Also, because the general practice is not uniform, there is no need to specify it. The Japanese plenipotentiary also stated that Japan will never hinder China's development of Manchuria in the future. His words were sincere and had the intention of respecting friendly countries. We should abide by each other." Fifth, according to Article 4 of the Treaty of Portsmouth signed by Japan and Russia, "Japan and Russia mutually agree not to obstruct any general plan adopted by China for all countries to develop the industry and commerce of the three eastern provinces." Since there is such an agreement in the Treaty of Portsmouth, the secret treaty that prohibits the construction of railways parallel to the South Manchuria Railway does not exist. Sixth, the Japanese government responded on December 28, 1899, to the note of Secretary of State Hay of the United States in 1899 regarding the Open Door. It stated that Japan was willing to accept this policy unconditionally. If this "secret treaty" is true, it violates the spirit of the Open Door policy. McLeod also said in his book Manchuria in International Competition, "Japan has been attacked for the so-called 'secret treaty' because she wants to undermine the spirit of the Open Door policy in Manchuria." Seventh, if this "secret treaty" is true, it violates the Nine-Power Treaty on the Far East signed on February 6, 1922. According to the above seven facts and reasons of refutation, the value of this "secret treaty" that does not exist is clear. The Japanese government suddenly announced it at this time, hoping to increase the data of the excuse for its violent launch. Alas, can the eyes and ears of the world be covered by one hand?</p>
<p>In short, in today's events, under the violent threat of the Japanese, what is right and wrong can be said? Which of the unequal treaties between China and Japan was not signed by Japan using cunning and insidious means? If we can recover the lost land by force today and drive the violent army out of the country, then the right and wrong will be clear. It is not necessary to calculate whether the "secret treaty" exists. If it cannot, then it does not exist. Is it not possible to say that there is justice and right and wrong in the world of power?</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Proposes to Japan to Conclude a Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>Aizawa Passes Through Moscow</p>
<p>Litvinov Makes Oral Proposal</p>
<p>Japan Has Not Yet Made a Clear Statement</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Moscow, 16th. The Soviet Taas News Agency revealed this morning that the Soviet government intends to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan, similar to those previously concluded by the Soviet Union with European neighboring countries. According to the agency, when Japanese Foreign Minister Aizawa passed through Moscow on December 31st, Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov proposed that Russia and Japan could conclude a non-aggression treaty. Now, the foreign military and adventure circles are making various speculations, believing that the relations between the two countries may deteriorate. If this treaty is concluded at this time, it will be extremely important. Litvinov also asked Aizawa to pay attention to the negotiations between Russia and Western countries regarding non-aggression treaties, and stated that Japan is the only neighboring country of the Soviet Union that has not concluded or negotiated such a treaty. The news agency also stated that on January 12th, the Russian ambassador to Japan met with Japanese Prime Minister Inukai to discuss the Manchurian issue, especially the Japanese military presence in northern Manchuria. The Russian ambassador inquired about Inukai's attitude towards the Russian Foreign Minister's proposal to Aizawa. Inukai replied that Japan had absolutely no intention of infringing upon Russian interests or the interests of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Manchuria. As for the non-aggression treaty, the Japanese government has not yet studied it, he said.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 16th. This morning, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs neither acknowledged nor denied the news from the Moscow Russian News Agency about Russia and Japan planning to conclude a non-aggression treaty. However, those responsible on the Russian side stated that when Aizawa passed through Tokyo, the Russian authorities did make this proposal.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 16th. Japanese Foreign Minister Aizawa acknowledged today in a conversation with others that Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov did inquire about his opinion on Russia and Japan concluding a non-aggression treaty. This proposal from the Russian Foreign Minister has not yet been submitted to the cabinet. The general opinion here is that Japan does not want to conclude this treaty, because the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which Russia and Japan have signed, is already sufficient to guarantee non-aggression. Moreover, Japan has never concluded such a treaty with other countries and has no intention of occupying Russian territory, it is said.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Moscow, 16th. Today, Russian officials strongly refuted the Japanese news that the Russian ambassador had visited Inukai Tsuyoshi a few days ago to explore Japan's attitude towards concluding a Russo-Japanese alliance, solemnly stating that Russia had never proposed to the new or former Japanese Foreign Minister the conclusion of an alliance. They said that when the Russian ambassador met with Inukai Tsuyoshi, the discussion mainly focused on the situation in the three eastern provinces, especially the revival of the political and military preparations of the White Russian elements in northern Manchuria. However, they also admitted that the Russian ambassador did mention during the conversation the possibility of Russia and Japan negotiating a non-aggression treaty, asking if the Japanese side had made a decision on their attitude. This proposal was made by Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov when Aizawa passed through the country. It is reported that Inukai Tsuyoshi replied that the Japanese government had not yet had time to study the matter, but at the same time assured the Russian ambassador that Japan had no intention of infringing upon Soviet Russian interests or the Chinese Eastern Railway, he said.</p>
<h3>Draft Disarmament Treaty Established</h3>
<p>The Result of Five Years of Preparation</p>
<p>Will Serve as a Basis for Discussion at the Conference</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Geneva, 15th. The World Disarmament Conference will be convened here on February 2nd. It is heard that a draft agreement has been established among the countries, which can serve as the basis for discussion at the Disarmament Conference. The draft agreement is the result of five years of hard work by the League of Nations Preparatory Commission for Disarmament, and has evolved from the previously failed Geneva Three-Power Naval Disarmament Conference in 1927 and the now-abolished Anglo-French Naval Agreement, and the London Naval Conference of 1928. The International Preparatory Commission for Disarmament declared its closure on December 9, 1930. The reason for its lack of results was due to the opposition of Germany and Russia. Germany's opposition to the 1930 draft agreement was not against disarmament, but against the incompleteness of the disarmament. Because countries such as Japan and France all have long-trained reserves and are countries with conscription systems, if these are not restricted, disarmament will still be empty talk. Russia's opposition was largely the same as that of France and Germany, believing that the draft agreement could only consolidate the existing armaments of the countries and was not sufficient to prevent future military aggression. Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov had previously stated that he wished to reserve his right to present his personal proposal for a disarmament plan at the future Disarmament Conference, and Litvinov strongly advocated that all countries should completely abolish all armaments, or else they should abolish half of their armaments according to the current level of armaments in each country. Litvinov's proposal had previously been rejected by the representatives of various countries during the discussion in the Preparatory Committee. After deep and lengthy mutual deliberation and consultation, the draft agreement was finally established this time.</p>
<h3>Open and Covert Struggle Between Capitalist and Communist Systems Intensifying</h3>
<p>Planning a German Political Movement</p>
<p>Determining the Fate of the Soviets</p>
<p>Trotsky Publishes a Thesis</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 15th. Trotsky, an old comrade of Lenin who was expelled from Russia by the Red Army, wrote an article for the London Evening Standard today, telegraphed from Berlin. It said that the great struggle between the capitalist and communist systems for the world's power will be seen in Germany. This will be a fierce and cruel war, and the fate of the world may be decided within the next few months. If capitalism wins due to the movement of the Nazi Party in Germany, Bolshevism will be eliminated and the Russian Soviet government will inevitably collapse. But if Hitler fails in Germany, Germany will become a platform for world revolution to spread throughout the world. Conversely, if Hitler wins, he will definitely wage war against Russia. A Nazi-style German government can independently wage war against Russia, and Poland, Romania, the Baltic countries, and Japan will also stand on the same front as Germany. The result of this war is clearly visible, that is, Soviet Russia, in a very difficult situation, will be in a sad state of isolation and will encounter a life-and-death struggle. If the German Nazi Party succeeds, the Red Army will devote all its efforts to defend Germany, so as to defend itself, he said.</p>
<h3>Prelude to a Future Great War</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Will Start Next Month</p>

<h3>US Secretary of War Opposes Philippine Independence</h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Washington, 15th. Secretary of War Hurley has verbally informed President Hoover of the main points of the report on the investigation of the Philippine independence issue. However, the original report has not yet been released. It is heard that the report opposes allowing the Philippines to become independent, and this can only be done when its economic and political situation can make its position stable. The Philippine Independence Committee visited Hurley today. Hurley did not have a political discussion with them. The Associated Press has learned that the government intends to listen to the independence procedures proposed by the committee, because the government does not want to deny Philippine independence, but it cannot be easily allowed until the necessary economic and political goals have been achieved today. The government can accept the committee's procedures that are acceptable, and should amend those that need to be amended. If the committee demands immediate independence, the government will have to ignore it.</p>

<h3>US House of Representatives Passes Financial Rehabilitation Corporation Act</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 15th. The House of Representatives has now passed the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation Act. This bill was passed by the Senate on January 12th. It is expected that the company will start operating within a week. President Hoover will use this organization to assist industries throughout the country. Although both houses have passed this bill, it still needs to go through a joint conference of the two houses to reconcile the differences between the two houses. Then President Hoover can formally establish it. This company is managed by seven directors.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 15th. Important bankers here are very pleased to hear that the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation Act has been passed. They say that the fears in Europe that this act will cause prices to rise and that the United States will eventually abandon the gold standard are completely unfounded. The United States currently has approximately $4.5 billion in gold reserves. The purpose of this act is to stop the catastrophic fall in prices, which is actually caused by unwarranted panic about the current economic situation.</p>
<h3>Briand Declines Politics</h3>
<p>Pangul Appointed Permanent Representative to the League of Nations</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Paris, 15th. Today, it was firmly announced here that Briand will not assist in the reorganization of Laval's government. Due to old age and physical weakness, Briand must rest at least temporarily, so he firmly refused to accept the position of minister without portfolio and is unwilling to serve as France's permanent representative to the League of Nations in Geneva. It is now expected that Laval will invite Pangul, known for his promotion of peace, to serve as a minister without portfolio and permanent representative to the League of Nations. Although the position of Foreign Minister is currently held by Laval himself, it is generally expected that this position will eventually belong to Pang. Pang is fifty-eight years old and started as a lawyer and journalist. He won a medal for bravery during the European War.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Paris, 16th. This morning, Briand took a car to his villa in the Goche area to rest and will return to Paris on Monday.</p>

<p>Interfered with by the Police</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Madras, 16th. Picketers employed by the All-India Congress Emergency War Office surrounded the post office today to persuade people to withdraw their savings bank deposits. The police first used kind words to persuade them to leave, then threatened them, and even slapped them from time to time. Then they used fire hose to shoot water at them, but after these people left, they soon returned wearing raincoats and leather shoes, showing no sign of surrender. The picketers did this because they resented the authorities' arrest of Gandhi and insulted the All-India Congress.</p>
<h3>Berlin Busts Counterfeiting Case</h3>

<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 16th. German police actually busted a case of counterfeiting five-mark silver coins at the villa of Dr. Salepeng, a famous international law expert, in the suburbs of Berlin. In recent weeks, these counterfeit silver coins have flooded the Berlin market. After a strict investigation by the police, they finally found a clue.

However, Sal had wealth and fame, and had a lot of income, and the silver coins he minted were all in accordance with the legal fineness, and the profits he obtained were not equal to the danger he risked, so the police still do not know his intentions.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>French Legal Persons Attempt to Occupy Laoxikai in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Laoxikai area within the Second District and Sixth Precinct of Tianjin originally belonged to our country's jurisdiction. It was previously occupied by French legal persons, causing negotiations. After the Tianjin Incident occurred last year, the French Concession authorities initially set up outposts in the area in the name of protecting local security. Then, they effectively occupied the area, recruiting 120 Chinese police officers and establishing the Second Branch of the French Police in Tianjin. Starting from the first day of last month, they ordered all local residents and shops to pay taxes. After receiving the report, the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately sent Inspector Wang Song to investigate. According to the report, in the fifth year of the Republic of China, France intended to expand the concession by using Laoxikai as a base. This was opposed by the entire Chinese people and the entire strike by Chinese workers in the French Concession, and it remains an unresolved issue to this day. After investigating Laoxikai, which originally belonged to the Second District and Sixth Precinct, it has requested the former Director Ceng to negotiate with the French Consul. However, there was no result. During the Tianjin Incident this year, France took this opportunity and occupied Laoxikai in December. All houses and shops were required to pay taxes, and 120 Chinese police officers were recruited. Twenty-seven outposts were set up in the area, and the Second Branch of the French Police in Tianjin was established at 59 Yongji Li, etc. Then, Liu Zhicun, the leader of the Investigation Division, was sent to investigate again. According to the report, according to the Gengzi Treaty, the border of the French Concession was limited by the Qiangzi River. At that time, there were many desolate areas within the Qiangzi River, and the French had no intention of aggression. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, the French Consul Bao set up outposts in the so-called Laoxikai area outside the Qiangzi River using force. At that time, our Chinese police also set up a branch outside the Qiangzi River. Consul Bao used force to abduct our police to the French Bureau of Public Works. The people of Tianjin were furious for a while and established the National Land Maintenance Association to implement a strike against France and established a strike group. All Chinese who used French legal persons in the French Concession went on strike. The French Consul was extremely tough and deployed troops to defend, as if facing a formidable enemy. Later, the French Minister and the French government feared that a war would be provoked by a small matter and telegraphed the French Consul to privately release the captured Chinese police, and the guns were confiscated. The weapons are still in the French Bureau of Public Works to this day. This is one point of national humiliation. Afterwards, two, three, or four months later, the workers' strike group lacked funds and gradually disbanded. Consul Bao transferred from Tianjin, and Consul Gan, along with Yang Yide, the Chinese police chief at the time, peacefully resolved the issue. The workers also gradually resumed work. As a result, the French Bureau of Public Works gradually set up outposts outside the Qiangzi River, and the French never set up outposts further west. And our police, from that time on, invisibly cancelled the establishment of police outposts and secretly abandoned Laoxikai. For several years, the land and houses outside the Qiangzi River have no Chinese contracts, nor do they have French contracts to the French Church, only receipts are used as proof, but ninety percent of the Laoxikai area is controlled by the French Church. Regarding police power, the French Concession method has implicitly become the area in front of and behind the church. In the past, although Laoxikai did not set up outposts, it has repeatedly handled cases and investigated household registration on behalf of the area, and the area has gradually become prosperous. However, there is no house or shop tax, which is equivalent to a no-man's-land. In recent years, only the Chinese provincial government has required five jiao of foreign currency per mu and per person in the area. As for people's lawsuits, they still go to the French Bureau of Public Works, and France also accepts them. When our country's courts summon cases, they must be registered at the French Bureau of Public Works. At that time, both sides were in a hesitant state. Since the Tianjin Incident this time, the French Bureau of Public Works has fooled a number of local people and requested the establishment of outposts. The French Bureau of Public Works added outposts in this way and openly recognized the area as a concession. They began to collect industry and patrol taxes from December 1 of this year and set to collect taxes according to the regulations of the concession starting from January. Our people suspect that our government has given it away, and the people inside dare not ask about the street lights in the area. The electricity company has been selling electricity, but the French Concession has never dared to sell electricity. Now the French are discussing getting their hands on changing the Laoxikai map and incorporating it into the concession, which is completely contrary to the treaty, etc. After investigating and confirming the facts, the Municipal Public Security Bureau submitted a request to the Municipal Government at the end of last year to negotiate with the French. On the 9th of this month, the Municipal Government sent a letter to the French Consul General to raise questions. Yesterday (13th) at 11:00 am, the French Consul replied to the Municipal Government, stating that the French Bureau of Public Works was maintaining public order in Laoxikai and denied that they had collected taxes. At 3:00 pm, the French Bureau of Public Works sent Detective Chief Rao to meet with Liu Butong of the Municipal Party Headquarters to explain that the French set up outposts in Laoxikai because people requested them during the chaos. They acted out of good intentions to maintain local order, so the French Bureau of Public Works did not interfere with the people's actions. It was all handled by the Public Assembly, that is, the French Bureau of Public Works did not collect taxes, etc. The Municipal Government's letter and the French Consul's reply are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Municipal Government's Letter to the French Consul: Dear Sir, According to the Public Security Bureau's report, the Laoxikai area under the jurisdiction of the Second District and Sixth Precinct, during the Tianjin Incident on November 8 last year, the French Patrol Police took this opportunity to recruit 120 Chinese police officers and set up more than 20 outposts in the area. The Second Branch of the French Police in Tianjin was established at 59 Yongji Li, and various house and shop taxes were collected starting from December 1. This matter concerns national sovereignty, and we are obliged to submit a report for your review. The Tianjin Special Municipal Party Committee also sent a letter with the same reason. The Laoxikai area is under our country's jurisdiction, and the boundaries are clear. The treaty is there, and it cannot be confused. According to reports, during the Tianjin Incident, your side even had the incident of overstepping boundaries, expanding police power, and collecting taxes. Based on the previous information, in addition to issuing separate instructions and replying in writing, we should send a letter to your honorable Consul for review, asking whether the establishment of bureaus, outposts, and tax collection by your side in Laoxikai are true and what the situation is. To maintain friendship, this is addressed to Li Bili, the French Consul General in Tianjin.</p>
<p>▲French Consul's Reply: Dear Sir, I have received your government's letter of January 9, which stated, etc., in detail. The fact that the French Police Bureau maintains public order in the Laoxikai area is not a new fact. This issue has been decided for years and has been agreed upon with the Chinese authorities. There is no change to this. During the recent disturbances, at the request of the people and in response to the gradual increase in requests from the Chinese Police Bureau and the Chinese Court, the number of police officers has only increased. Furthermore, your officials have expressed their gratitude to our side. As for the issue of donations, I am very confused by the accusations. The French Bureau of Public Works has not collected any taxes in Laoxikai, nor will it collect them in the future. The details of its management are in the hands of the Public Council. This is just a malicious attack, which I, the Consul, have already requested your Mayor to pay attention to in my letter of January 6, 1932. I believe your Mayor will be able to take strict measures to stop it. This is addressed to Mayor Zhou of Tianjin, French Consul General in Tianjin, Li Bili, January 13, 1932.</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial Committee Cancels Resignation Intentions</h3>
<p>▲However, the Finance Director's Determination to Leave Remains Strong</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Chiang Kai-shek resigned and returned home, and the unified government was completed, the issue of the reorganization of the Hubei Provincial Government has become the focus of public attention. At the same time, the saying of the Nine-Province Joint Defense was widely spread in Beijing and Shanghai, making outsiders want to know the truth. The Yangtze and Han Rivers can originally be used to tip the scale. When He Yingqin and He Chengjun denied this matter, the doubts of the public gradually dissipated, but there was still no strong proof of the reorganization of the Hubei Provincial Government. Recently, it was suddenly reported that He Chengjun and the entire Provincial Committee had submitted a general resignation to the central government. After many inquiries, it was learned that He and the entire Provincial Committee did have this proposal at first, and the presentation had already been drafted. However, due to the urgency of diplomacy and the importance of provincial administration, they cancelled their intentions to resign. The central government also relied heavily on them. Sun Ke, the President of the Executive Yuan, sent Representative Zhang Guoyuan to Hankou on the 10th to discuss with He, which was quite satisfactory. He returned to Beijing yesterday to report. Currently, He and the directors of the Civil Affairs, Construction, and Education Departments go to the Provincial Government and various departments every day to handle affairs and are very enthusiastic. However, Wu Guozhen, the Director of Finance, is very determined to resign. On the 13th, Wu submitted his resignation to the Provincial Government again, stating that "Guozhen has shallow knowledge and mediocre talent, and has mistakenly managed the treasury. I should try my best to serve with diligence to repay your appreciation. However, since the beginning of my appointment, I have been faced with accumulated deficits. I have tried every means to maintain the status quo. I hoped that I would have some time to reorganize so that all tax revenues would increase and all expenditures would be less difficult. However, since the summer, there have been continuous rains and disasters, and in the autumn, the embankments have collapsed. The tax sources have been cut off, and disaster relief is not possible. Recently, the Northeast has fallen, the national crisis is in full swing, and the financial situation is extremely tight, which is rare in history. The central government subsidies and special tax agreements that I relied on in the past have been difficult to pay on time. The loans that I relied on to seek relief have been exhausted, and the mortgages have been used up. For months, I have been worried that I would not be able to support the security, and I have been worrying about it day and night, and my mind and body are exhausted. Although the New Year has been barely passed, the great difficulties of the coming days cannot be dealt with by my strength. I am afraid that there will be some delays, and the impact will be significant. I should resign and retreat to make way for the capable. I should submit a request for your review and forwarding to the higher authorities, and send someone to take over in advance." The Provincial Government discussed this at the political affairs meeting on the 14th and resolved to retain him. Due to the lack of government funds, it was decided to borrow rent for one month in Wuchang, Hanyang, and Hankou, using the unpaid subsidies from the central government for October, November, and December of last year as a principal repayment fund. If the subsidies cannot be received within three months, the 3 million short-term rehabilitation bonds previously approved by the central government will be used to repay. At the same time, the loan rent will be used as collateral to borrow 800,000 yuan from the Hankou General Chamber of Commerce to meet emergency needs. At the same time, it was also decided to increase the tax rate on business tax. The original rate of 10 per mille will be collected as before, and the 5 per mille will be increased to 6 per mille. The 2.5 per mille and below will be doubled, and the Finance Department will submit it to the Provincial Government for approval and implementation. (January 15)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Central Banknotes Experience a Run</h3>
<p>▲ Authorities Actively Curb Panic to Calm the Situation</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the cessation of military operations in Guangdong Province, financial authorities have successively sought ways to maintain the value of banknotes issued in the province. The one-yuan denomination of the central banknotes has now resumed redemption, and the five-yuan denomination also resumed redemption on the 8th. If the situation stabilizes somewhat, the implementation would proceed smoothly. Unexpectedly, the day after the five-yuan banknotes resumed redemption, many rumors circulated in the market. Some rumors claimed that Wang Jingwei had resigned, and the situation might change drastically. Others claimed that the banknotes previously sealed up in the province would be unsealed on the 11th, and interest would be paid simultaneously. At that time, the market would be flooded with central banknotes, and the price of the central banknotes would inevitably be affected. Various opinions abounded, and no consensus could be reached. Therefore, those who usually held central banknotes rushed to the provincial bank (formerly the Guangdong Central Bank, which was reorganized into the Guangdong Provincial Bank on January 1st) to redeem them. From the morning of the 9th, the provincial bank was overwhelmed with redemption requests. By about 5 p.m., there were still two or three hundred people standing in front of the provincial bank. In order to maintain credit, the president of the provincial bank supervised the staff to expedite the process and redeem banknotes as quickly as they were received. It is reported that the provincial bank redeemed about 350,000 yuan in cash throughout the 9th. On the 10th, many exchange shops in the city dared not open for business, and they politely refused to redeem central banknotes by claiming they had no cash. Although shops dared not explicitly refuse to accept them, they secretly raised prices. As a result, the central banknotes that had been redeemed were discounted, and the price of those that had not been redeemed dropped from 97 to 91 cents on the dollar. However, observing the situation in Guangdong, the security is currently stable, and it is expected that this banknote panic will soon subside. On the day the panic suddenly erupted, the financial authorities immediately convened a meeting to discuss ways to curb the panic. In addition to Shen Zaihe and Huang Guanzhang, the president and vice president of the provincial bank, there were also representatives from the Department of Finance, such as Ye Qing and Liang Zhiguang. As a result, four measures were agreed upon: ㈠ The 10th is a bank holiday, and the provincial bank decided to comply by suspending redemption for one day. ㈡ Redemption will continue on the 11th. ㈢ All revenue collection agencies will strictly enforce the rule that taxes must be accepted in full with redeemed central banknotes. ㈣ The unsealing of the central banknotes on the 11th will be temporarily suspended, and the date for unsealing will be rescheduled after the panic subsides. Furthermore, in order to fundamentally maintain the credit of the banknotes, the Department of Finance is implementing the third phase of its plan to maintain the value of the central banknotes. This plan involves issuing 5 million yuan in prize-bearing bonds, divided into 1 million bonds, each worth 5 yuan, with the province's consolidated tax revenue as collateral. A lottery will be drawn each month to repay the principal and pay interest, with 530,000 yuan of consolidated tax revenue allocated each time to be managed by a fund management committee as a fixed fund. The temporary solution is to use the 10 million yuan in funds currently held by the provincial bank for redemption, and to entrust reputable banks to redeem the banknotes on its behalf. It has been verified that the regulations for the issuance of 5 million yuan in prize-bearing bonds to maintain the value of the central banknotes were announced by the Department of Finance on the 9th, and the issuance will begin on the 15th.

<p>Local Dispatches</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>The Origin of the Bandit Scare in Tuolin: The county Public Security Bureau has investigated and reported that the bandit scare in Tuolin is inaccurate. However, regarding the origin of the rumors, according to a report from Ma Teng, the director of the seventh branch of the local Public Security Bureau, a large gang of salt smugglers suddenly arrived in the area several days ago. There were two or three hundred of them, and they were buying smuggled salt in various coastal towns, loading it onto ships, and planning to export it. The salt police authorities discovered the situation and immediately dispatched an anti-smuggling patrol team to intervene. However, the smugglers firmly insisted that if the authorities did not accommodate them, they would rather fight to the death. The police team, in addition to mobilizing its forces to prepare for a thorough suppression, also notified the Public Security Bureaus of Songjiang and Fengxian counties, informing the public not to panic. Fortunately, local figures intervened to mediate, averting a disaster, but the community had already suffered a considerable scare. It is now learned that, in order to maintain security along the coast, the military and police authorities specially dispatched the first platoon of the first company of the fourth battalion of the Second Regiment of the Provincial Security Infantry from Jinshanwei to be stationed there yesterday to maintain order.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Compensation Dispute at Rentang Pawnshop in Jintan: Previously, the Rentang Pawnshop in Jintan County was robbed, and a fire was set. The county's party and government organs decided to compensate 80% of the value and deduct 1% interest, and submitted the decision to the Civil Affairs Department and the Construction Department for approval. Later, due to an appeal from the pawnshop's shareholders, the Civil Affairs Department and the Industry Department sent a telegram to the county on a good day, changing the compensation to 50%. This caused conflict between the pawnshop staff and the pawn customers. Police and civilians were injured. Currently, pawn customers have gathered, firmly requesting that the original plan of compensating 80% be followed. The situation is serious.

<p>Correspondence</p>
<h3>Letter from the Adjutant Office of the 121st Brigade</h3>
<p>Sir, after reading your newspaper's Zhenjiang news column on the 15th of this month, which stated that the 121st Brigade reportedly sent a team to Wuchang wheel to seize more than 10,000 taels of opium, it was found that it was not entirely consistent with the facts. It is feared that the report from afar may be inaccurate. The details of that day are hereby sent to you in a letter, hoping that you will correct the record. On the 12th, according to a confidential report, bandits Qian Song and others secretly boarded the Wuchang wheel in Anqing, carrying dangerous goods, and came to Zhenjiang and Shanghai to form gangs, endangering security and order. In order to maintain security, this brigade could not but take precautions. Immediately, personnel were sent to the wheel together with customs officials from the Zhenjiang Customs to check. One person who looked suspicious was found and searched. Eight packages of opium were seized. This brigade, in addition to transferring the opium to the customs in accordance with the procedures to take back the receipt, and the Qiu comprador of the Wuchang wheel also signed a document proving the inspection of the eight packages of opium, the wheel did not have other losses, there was really no other situation. The so-called seizure of more than 10,000 taels of opium is even more untrue. The Adjutant Office of the 121st Brigade.</p>

<h3>Anhui Province's Education Sector's Demand for Arrears is Increasingly Urgent</h3>
<p>▲ Middle School Principals Go to the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Education to Petition</p>
<p>The presidents of Anhui Provincial Secondary Schools and the heads of social education institutions have come to Nanjing to demand arrears. Although the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance agreed to sign a report to Minister Huang, requesting that 100,000 yuan be issued, only 20,000 yuan was actually issued. The principals believe that only 20,000 yuan was issued out of a total of 445,000 yuan in arrears, which is less than 1/22 of the total amount, making it difficult to return to Anhui. Just as the Ministry of Finance was changing hands, it was decided to launch a large-scale movement after the new Minister of Finance takes office.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 16th - On the morning of the 16th, more than 20 principals, curators, and superintendents of various middle schools in Anhui Province went to the Ministry of Finance to demand arrears, but no one received them.

Chairman Yu Hongjun gave a welcome speech, saying that the alma mater's motto is "Light and Truth," and alumni should follow this motto when serving society in order to save the country. Then, Huang Yingbai was invited to give a speech. Mr. Huang said that St. John's has a history of more than 50 years, and talented people have emerged in large numbers. The alumni association should be organized like the alumni of Cambridge University. During the annual meeting, members should report on their experiences in serving society, and it is hoped that St. John's alumni will work hard to build a Greater Shanghai.

The five generals, Donghua Tu Kaiyuan, Chen Jiaqiu, Li Yichen, as well as the businessmen Feng Yunyou and Liang Shutang, will participate in the Malayan team to play, one as a forward, two as a center defender, and one as a defender. With the five pillars inside and outside Malaya, it is enough to support the precarious situation and open up a new situation. However, Chen Zhenhe, the left winger of the Shanghai team, has not recovered from his leg injury and has been replaced by Lie Telei. Right defender Ma Sair has left Shanghai and has been replaced by Li Ningcan. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>

<h3>Why Distinguish Between Victory and Defeat in One Family</h3>
<p>Yesterday's battle was originally between two sides of the same family. Victory and defeat are not worth counting. The focus is on China's individual talents and the teamwork of the entire team, as the basis for the lineup for future formal battles. The Malayan team is only a guest, but its defeat is due to the weakness of the center defense line, the instability of the inner defense, and the slowness of the forwards' actions. Only the goalkeeper's performance was amazing. He suffered a lot in the first half, losing six goals in a row. He struggled hard in the second half and won back one goal. It seems that China had a suspicion of respecting the guests. As a result, China won 6-1. Referee: Chen Jixiang</p>
<h3>Two Goalkeepers, Different Levels of Ease</h3>
<p>Zhou Xianyan of China and Huang Jinbai of Malaya are both goalkeepers with astonishing talent. However, due to the effectiveness of their respective internal defense and support, they experienced different levels of ease. Throughout the ninety minutes, Zhou Xianyan missed one save, which was his mistake. Ning Dao bravely cleared a dangerous shot, narrowly avoiding a disaster. The final goal conceded was simply Zhou showing hospitality as the home team. Huang Jinbai, on the other hand, became the target of public criticism, facing immense pressure and inevitably missing some shots. The fourth goal, when Chen Hongguang seized the opportunity to break through, was Huang's oversight. With the defense collapsing, one man alone could not hold it. The blame for the other five goals conceded lies with the ineffective support.</p>
<h3>Old Partners Reunite After Long Separation</h3>
<p>Li Ning and Feng Yunyou were old partners during the golden era of Yue Hua. Later, they pursued their own paths and went their separate ways. Now serving China, they reunite after a long separation, their interceptions and blocks forming an impenetrable defense. Jiang Shan's performance in the second half was also very satisfactory. In short, there was a world of difference. The five Malayan forwards constantly hit walls, truly feeling the despair of being unable to advance.</p>
<h3>Central Defenders Excel in Both Offense and Defense</h3>
<p>The most obvious difference between the two sides was the strength of their central defense lines. Malaya's Huang Kehou could handle one opponent, but he couldn't manage the overall situation due to his limited abilities. China's three players, however, were extremely effective. Tu Kaiyuan is undoubtedly the number one central defender among Chinese players today. Chen Jiaqiu and Liang Shutang excelled in both soft and hard defense, contributing to the six-goal lead in the first half. Changing the formation in the second half made them less cohesive than in the first half.</p>
<h3>The Five Forwards Bursting with Energy</h3>
<p>China's five forwards were all bursting with energy. Speaking objectively, Dai Linjing led the troops and followed every command. Feigning a shot, he broke the Malayan defense with his power. His specialty was delivering effective passes and providing timely support. Mei Hongbao, on the right wing, made significant contributions with his quick movements and well-timed crosses, a rare talent. Chen Hongguang's brilliance was evident as he scored three goals, accounting for half of the total. It seemed as if fortune was smiling upon him. Qian Jingyong has great potential, but his eagerness to win sometimes led to offside fouls. Chen Yutian was agile and scored a goal, leveraging his strengths. If Chen Zhenhe and Qiu Dongyan had been on the field, they would have undoubtedly put on some more amazing performances.</p>
<h3>Six Goals in One Breath</h3>
<p>Reviewing the course of the battle, in the first ten minutes, although China had the wind advantage, the situation was still stable. Then, Mei Hongbao crossed from the right to the left, Qian Hongguang stepped aside, Qian Jingyong passed it back, and Dai Linjing pushed it into the goal, breaking the deadlock. Subsequently, China scored one goal after another. Within three minutes, Chen Hongguang scored. Five minutes later, Dai's shot hit the goalpost and bounced in. Eight minutes later, Hongguang scored twice in a row. The final goal was kicked in by Chen Yutian, completing the half-dozen. Thus, the first half concluded.</p>
<h3>Respectful Guest, a Consolation Goal</h3>
<p>The Malayan forwards didn't initially exert their full effort, making it difficult to penetrate deep into the opposing territory and execute their shooting skills. In the second half, the Chinese forwards seemed intent on simply finishing the game, and the Malayan counterattacks increased. However, their slowness resulted in numerous missed opportunities in front of the goal. With accurate and powerful shots, they could have achieved more. At that time, Dai made three impressive shots, all effectively saved by the goalkeeper. In the end, Malaya's Guan Xinde scored a goal when the opponent showed no resistance, salvaging a narrow defeat. The result was a 6-1 loss for Malaya, their fourth defeat in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yiyuan Deserted, Yue Hua Lost to Navy</h3>
<p>▲ 2-4 | Group A Match</p>
<p>The Yue Hua football team lost to the British Navy by a score of 2-4 yesterday in the deserted Yiyuan. This Group A match saw an incomplete lineup and a lackluster performance, allowing the sailors to avenge their previous 7-1 defeat.</p>
<h3>Desolate Scene</h3>
<p>Excluding the players, there were fewer than thirty people in the vast stands. Newspaper reporters accounted for four of them, and the thirty also included the park's staff and attendants. There were no female spectators. The usual stream of cars was reduced to only three, creating a desolate atmosphere. Did people know Yue Hua would lose and fear disappointment?</p>
<h3>Navy's Progress</h3>
<p>The navy's team yesterday still consisted of players from the Kangwei and Liangwei ships. After losing to Yue Hua 1-7, they surprisingly defeated Lax 8-4 last Saturday, shocking many. Their skills had indeed improved significantly. They had many chances in front of Yue Hua's goal yesterday, but their poor shooting resulted in countless missed opportunities.</p>
<h3>Yue Hua's Disarray</h3>
<p>Yue Hua's lineup was disorganized yesterday, which was also a reason for their defeat. Many key players were absent, taking leave and going home. Several new players joined, which diminished their coordination and shooting, resulting in the sailors cornering them.</p>
<h3>Course of Defeat</h3>
<p>The first half ended 2-1, with the navy taking the lead. The second half also ended 2-1, making the final score 4-2, and Yue Hua lost. The navy's right inside forward, Hansen, scored first. Yue Hua's right winger, Chen Chao, tied the score. Stevens scored again, ending the first half. In the second half, Wan Xianghua received Yang Renwei's pass and tied the score again at 2-2. Unexpectedly, the navy scored two consecutive goals, with Hansen and Cox each scoring once, ending the game at 4-2.</p>

<h3>Wu Tiecheng Continued Discussing Financial Problems with All Sectors Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Even Closer Than Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, representatives from all sectors continued the financial conference at Mayor Wu's residence. On the government side, Wu Tiecheng, Cai Zengji, Zhang Qun, and Chen Mingshu attended. On the representatives' side, besides Qin Runqing, who was unable to attend due to business and was replaced by Pei Yunqing, the remaining six were still Zhang Gongquan, Li Fukun, Wang Xiaolai, Shi Liangcai, Du Yuesheng, and Zhang Xiaolin. After adjourning the previous night, the representatives scrambled in all directions, raising five million. The meeting began at around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The representatives reported on the fundraising situation. The government side still believed that it was far from sufficient and urged the representatives to work harder to raise more funds. At that time, the representatives put forward proposals, stating that the current situation was urgent. If they waited for the new Minister of Finance to take office, it would be too late. It would be better to ask Huang Hanliang and Lin Kanghou to temporarily not step down and handle the loan procedures. It was heard that the general idea of ​​their proposals was to consolidate the public debt fund on the one hand and ease the financial atmosphere on the other. From then on, the government's finances must be made public. In short, all the representatives were very willing to cooperate with the government in borrowing money and make efforts to proceed in the hope of maintaining the status quo of the government. Finally, Chen Mingshu stated that the proposal to suspend the payment of principal and interest on public debt was truly a last resort. If the finances could be managed, the government would definitely not want to resort to this tactic. The previous rumor that there were 20,000 soldiers who would use force if the loan could not be managed was a misunderstanding. Fortunately, through repeated meetings between the two sides, they were very close, so the government and the people would definitely be able to cooperate effectively in the future. It was said that a meeting would still be held today.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng's Talk</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng issued a statement to reporters yesterday, saying that at 3 p.m. on the 15th, he made an appointment with the Shanghai financial community to discuss financial issues at the Bankers Association. A certain newspaper reported the situation at that time, and there were some discrepancies in his remarks. For example, he reported that "Sun Yat-sen and others returned to Beijing this time, originally intending to discuss the special committee, deciding to sever relations with Japan and stop paying principal and interest," and so on. He did not make these remarks. It must be understood that Sun Yat-sen took on the important responsibility of the executive this time and was responsible to the Central Political Council. With the national crisis at hand, the situation was becoming increasingly serious, and the three gentlemen, Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, and Hu Hanmin, had not yet gone to Beijing. There was no way to adhere to the major policy. In order to cope with the current emergency situation, it was proposed to set up a special committee under the Central Political Council before the standing committee members of the Central Political Council arrived in Beijing. According to the policy decided by the Central Political Council, the emergency political affairs will be dealt with. As for the rumors from the outside that the government has implemented a policy of severing relations with Japan and stopping paying principal and interest, this is just an unavoidable method proposed by someone, and it is not a decided policy. People outside do not know the truth and think it is a fact. This is where the rumor comes from.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Leaves Hospital and Goes to Hangzhou to Meet Chiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Ms. Chen Bijun and others traveled with him.</p>
<p>▲ Wang also telegraphed Hu Hanmin to urge him to come.</p>
<p>After Wang Jingwei was admitted to Rohrer Hospital, the German doctor injected him with medicine, and his condition improved slightly. Wang was urged by all parties to go to Beijing very enthusiastically in recent days. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek replied to Wang, inviting him to Hangzhou for talks. Therefore, at 5:40 PM yesterday, he urged him to leave the hospital and go directly to Fanhuangdu Station to take the 6:20 PM train to Hangzhou to meet Chiang, expressing his active desire to serve the country. His wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, traveled with him. The details of his departure from Shanghai are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chen Mingshu, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai at around 6 a.m. yesterday, holding Chiang Kai-shek's personal letter to Wang, accompanied by Fan Qiwu. After resting briefly at his residence, he went to Haig Road to meet Mayor Wu Tiecheng at 9 a.m. and talked for about an hour. At around 10 a.m., he went to Gu Mengyu's residence on Pushi Road and talked for about two hours. Chen left at around 12 p.m. After Chen left, Gu immediately took Chiang's letter to see Wang Jingwei and conveyed Chen Mingshu's message that Chiang hoped to invite Wang to meet him in Hangzhou. After discussion, Wang decided to leave the hospital and go to Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Wang Leaves Hospital</h3>
<p>Wang ordered his family to prepare at 4 p.m. yesterday and left the hospital at 5:40 p.m. Wang wore a gray leather robe and looked listless. He was supported down the stone steps by his nephew Chen Yaozu, and then helped into the car by his wife, Chen Bijun. The reporter, seeing that Wang was going to Hangzhou while ill, did not have time to ask him in detail. After asking about his health, Wang only answered "slightly better." At that time, the car had already started. There were also two cars traveling with Wang, carrying his relatives and followers.</p>
<h3>Fanhuangdu Station</h3>
<p>Wang's three cars left the hospital one after another. After about fifteen minutes, they arrived at Fanhuangdu Station in West Shanghai. The 32nd Shanghai-Hangzhou night express train had not yet departed, so Wang and his wife temporarily entered the station master's office to wait. At 6:35 p.m., the Hangzhou night train arrived at the station, and Wang and others boarded the last carriage, car number P·C503, which was pre-ordered to be attached to the end of the night express train. After stopping at Fanhuangdu for about two minutes, it departed southward. It was expected to arrive at the city station at 10:15 p.m. that night.</p>
<h3>Accompanying Family Members</h3>
<p>In addition to his wife, Chen Bijun, those traveling with Wang yesterday included his daughter Ms. Mei Yi (transliteration), nephew Chen Yaozu, relatives Mr. Li, Mr. Liu, and others, a group of six or seven people. All of his secretaries were not in Shanghai, so none of them accompanied him.</p>
<h3>Doctor's Talk</h3>
<p>The reporter, seeing that Wang was suddenly going to Hangzhou, drove to Rohrer Hospital on Avenue Joffre to visit the dean, Rohrer, who kindly made the following remarks: (Question) Is it true that Mr. Wang went to Hangzhou this afternoon? (Rohrer replied) This is true. (Question) Then Mr. Wang has fully recovered from his illness? (Answer) Mr. Wang's health has generally recovered. Mr. Wang's diabetes in his salt has reached 98 points, which is no different from ordinary people, and his liver disease has also been cured by injections.</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu's Talk</h3>
<p>The reporter met with Chen Mingshu yesterday. According to the talks after meeting with Chiang, Chiang expressed very well and was willing to do his best to assist the government in finances, foreign affairs, etc. Chiang also hoped that all sectors could unanimously support the government and overcome this difficulty. Moreover, I have rarely expressed any opinions to reporters in the past, but recently newspapers have said that I will do this and that in terms of finance, which is really strange. My political speeches completely set aside my military status. If I put pressure on the financial community, then why don't I use this spirit against foreigners as a revolutionary soldier? As for Chiang Kai-shek's going to Beijing, there is no problem, but I hope that no accidents will happen in Guangdong at this time, then Mr. Chiang will make a statement soon. Furthermore, as far as I know, there is no such thing as Guangdong withholding taxes.</p>
<h3>Urge Hu to Go North Telegram</h3>
<p>Wang telegraphed Hu Hanmin before leaving Shanghai, saying: Hong Kong China Telegraph Bureau transfers to Mr. Hu Hanmin: My brother has been sick for ten days, and he has only recently recovered slightly. During his illness, he has repeatedly received telegrams and letters from Nanjing and comrades from all parties urging my brother and others to go to Beijing to jointly overcome the national crisis and save the country. He is anxious and cannot express himself. Brother Jie has now arrived in Hangzhou and invited my brother to meet him. My brother intends to go and discuss everything. How is my brother's health recently? I miss you very much. I hope you can set off north immediately so that you can be taught in case of trouble. This telegram is to inform you and ask for a reply. Wang Zhaoming sincerely,</p>
<h3>Telegram to Sun Ke, etc.</h3>
<p>Another telegram to Sun Ke and others said: Nanjing Executive Yuan President Sun and Vice President Chen are both informed. My brother informed the two brothers earlier that the injection would be completed on the 10th of this month, and he could go to Beijing to recuperate. Later, due to dizziness on the 6th and 7th, the injection was stopped and extended until this morning. It has been completed. I heard that Brother Jie has come to Hangzhou, and I plan to go and meet him immediately. I hope to go to Beijing with him. First report this to you. Wang Zhaoming sincerely,</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun's Talk</h3>
<p>▲ The Process of Going to Hangzhou to See Chiang</p>
<p>Zhang Yuejun issued a statement to reporters yesterday, saying: (Reporter asked) Mr. went to Hangzhou yesterday afternoon and returned to Shanghai last night. Why are you in such a hurry? Can I hear about it? (Zhang replied) I originally wanted to stay in Hangzhou for a few days this time. Because I visited Mr. Chiang and talked about the Shanghai community's opposition to the financial policy of suspending the payment of principal and interest on domestic debt proposed by the capital, and the process of Mayor Wu's consultation with Shanghai bankers on relief. Chen, the vice president, also arrived in Hangzhou from Beijing and urged Chiang to go to Beijing. Chiang believed that the suspension of the payment of principal and interest on domestic debt would be enough to cause a national financial shock and the panic of national economic bankruptcy. However, the government's finances were in a desperate situation, and if it did not seek to save it, it would not be the way to overcome national difficulties together. The government and the banking industry groups should be based on the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation and do their best to help the government within the scope of possibility to overcome the difficulties. He specifically asked me to rush back to Shanghai with Mr. Chen to convey this intention to the leaders of the banking industry and make it a success, so as to fulfill his responsibility to assist the government in the field. (Reporter asked) Can Mr. Chiang be bound to go to Beijing in the near future to comfort the expectations of all parties? (Zhang replied) Mr. Chiang is not impossible to go to Beijing, but because of the current environmental relationship, it is better to go there. The reason is that Mr. Chiang's remarks published in the Shanghai newspapers the day before yesterday have already explained it very clearly. At this time, going to Beijing, especially going to Beijing alone, is not only useless to the overall situation, but also gives an excuse to prevent the resurrection of dictatorship, and in fact seeks to split the agitation materials, which will only increase the disputes. Although Chiang is in the field, he will do his best to eliminate difficulties, strive to maintain, and consolidate the current unified government in Nanjing, whether he is in Beijing or not, and there are various pieces of evidence to prove it. (Reporter asked) What will Mr. do in the future? (Zhang replied) I have been exhausted recently, and I still feel overwhelmed in Shanghai. I plan to leave Shanghai temporarily in the next few days to take a rest.</p>
<h3>Today's Citizens' Assembly</h3>
<p>▲ The Police Authorities Took Strict Precautions</p>
<p>At 10 a.m. today, people from all walks of life will hold a citizens' assembly at the West Gate Public Stadium. Representatives from the city's agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic circles will participate. Fearing that unscrupulous elements may infiltrate, the police authorities have pre-assigned detectives and police officers to the venue today for strict protection.</p>
<h3>Joint Announcement by Military and Political Authorities</h3>
<p>▲ The Communist Party Has a Conspiracy to Disrupt</p>
<p>▲ Reiterate the Prohibition and Strictly Suppress It</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Command issued a joint announcement yesterday, saying: To announce the matter, it has been found that since the Northeast Incident, the patriotic people of this city have been stirred by righteous indignation and have held demonstrations from time to time. However, the Communist Party and reactionaries have often been mixed in among them, resulting in numerous incidents of illegal and out-of-bounds actions. The Public Security and Social Education Bureaus have been ordered to properly persuade and suppress them. According to secret reports, the Communist Party and reactionaries have still been active recently, attempting to use the power of the masses to carry out their conspiracy of sabotage. The mayor and commander are responsible for maintaining local stability and cannot shirk their responsibility. Therefore, the prohibition is reiterated. If any lawless people disregard local security and plot to cause trouble, the mayor and commander will definitely enforce the law and punish them and will never forgive them. All patriotic people, please do not blindly follow and fall into the trap of the law. It is appropriate to announce this, and everyone must abide by it.</p>
<h3>The Three District Party Headquarters Ask All Sectors to Carefully Consider Strikes and Stoppages</h3>
<p>Zhonghua News Agency reported that the executive committee of the Second District Party Headquarters of this city, due to the urgent national crisis, had telegraphed the party and state leaders Wang, Chiang, and Hu to go to Beijing immediately to jointly overcome the national crisis and save the country. However, it has been reported in the newspapers in recent days that a citizens' assembly will be held in this city today and that strikes and stoppages will be advocated as a diplomatic backup. The association believes that in the autumn of foreign aggression and national crisis, these actions should be carefully considered. Therefore, it issued a declaration yesterday, saying that the invasion of Japan has made the national crisis deeper. During this period, the people of the whole country should unite as one, support the government in hard work and struggle, and cooperate sincerely to resist aggression and save the country. However, there have recently been advocates for strikes and stoppages. According to strikes and stoppages, the most painful sacrifices of the people can promote the responsibility of the authorities internally and show their weaknesses externally. For the sake of resisting aggression and violence and for the sake of the nation and the country, I deeply feel that this is not something that can be easily tried. People from all walks of life should understand the righteousness, carefully consider the situation, and clarify the advantages and disadvantages before carefully considering it in order to maintain the ambition of resisting Japan and saving the country. In addition to telegraphing the authorities to quickly save the country, this association dares to present its humble opinions and sincerely advises, hoping to be examined.

<h3>Two Route Party Headquarters Telegraph Three Leaders to Come to the Capital</h3>
<p>The Two Route Special Party Headquarters telegraphed Wang, Chiang, and Hu, saying: "To Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, Mr. Wang Jingwei, and Mr. Hu Hanmin, as relayed by various newspaper offices: Foreign aggression has deepened, and the national crisis is imminent. National ruin is pressing. Some of you may have retreated into the mountains, claiming purity and seclusion, while others have health issues and cannot be expected to worry and toil. Consequently, the supreme authority remains vacant, the central government lacks a leader, and the public is anxious and unable to endure the situation. We believe that you are leaders of the party and the nation, and the center of the revolution. At this time of national crisis and widespread misery, we hope you will prioritize the party and the nation, heed public opinion, and immediately come to the capital despite your health concerns. With the initial intention of peace and unity, devise grand strategies for internal stability and external resistance. Sharing the same boat in stormy weather, alleviate the national crisis together. Stabilizing the precarious situation is at stake. Please convey our respects, etc. Great fortune for the party and the nation, great fortune for the people. Sincerely, the Special Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways."</p>
<h3>National Salvation Association Telegrams Wang, Hu, and Chiang</h3>
<p>The National Salvation Association telegraphed the three Standing Committee members, saying: "To Mr. Wang Jingwei in Shanghai, Mr. Hu Hanmin in Hong Kong, and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek in Fenghua: Since the border conflicts began, the three of you were elected as Standing Committee members, bearing the burden of responsibility and being the hope of the people. However, for over a month, you have not assumed office, some claiming illness, others engaging in leisurely pursuits. The central government is in a precarious state, with no one in charge. The establishment of branch offices and the interception of national taxes have led to increased disputes, making unification impossible. The three of you have pledged to sacrifice for the nation and the party. Your lofty actions are untimely, and your devotion is incomplete. You are collectively acting passively, causing bewilderment and alarm. Do you view the nation as a broken earthenware pot or the party as worn-out shoes? This should not be the intention of the three of you. Moreover, the diplomatic situation is urgent, and the nation is in peril. We previously over-relied on the League of Nations and failed to prepare for military defense, resulting in the daily shrinking of our territory and the increasing aggression of our enemies. If the three of you do not wish to be guilty of ruining the nation and the party, you should shoulder the heavy responsibility of saving the nation and the party. Observation is not wisdom, jealousy is not benevolence, and fear is not courage. We propose that you immediately go to Beijing to assume office, quickly decide on a grand strategy, vigorously address the current difficulties, and act as a pillar in the midst of the storm. Do not be divided in your aims, otherwise the party will be in grave danger. If you hesitate and look back with unclear intentions, and treat the perilous nation lightly, you will be ridiculed by other nations. The three of you should consider the nation, the party, and yourselves. How can you afford to do so? We present this candidly and hope for your consideration. Sincerely, Qian Chengxu, Xiong Zhefan, Wang Yunzhang, Shen Jingzhong, Zhao Yun'an, and others of the National Salvation Association."</p>

However, in reality, Jinzhou has recently fallen, and the situation within the country is precarious. The government, lacking a central leader, has no solution. If we, the people, are unwilling to sit and wait for our doom, we should discuss self-defense measures. Today's meeting was born out of this mission."

<h3>Sheng Minxiu Telegraphed Encouragement to He Zhuguo</h3>
<p>In view of the escalating aggression by the violent Japanese and the successive retreats of our troops in Jinzhou and Suiyuan, He Zhuguo, the commander of the Second Brigade of the Northeast Border Defense Army, had expressed his determination to defend Shanhaiguan and fulfill his military duty while governing the army at Luan River. Sheng Minxiu (former advisor to the Central Route Army during the anti-Russian war), an old friend of He's in Shanghai, specially sent a telegram of consolation yesterday. The original telegram is recorded below: "Commander He Zhuguo, distinguished merit: In the summer of the eighteenth year, I wandered in Jin, Yi, and Chaoyang. You did not abandon He Fei, and I gathered information from you. I secretly admired you greatly. Later, when the Sino-Russian Incident occurred, I, with the feeling of treating the symptoms in an emergency, served as an advisor to the Central Route Army, followed Brother Chu (Huang Shiyue)'s army to Jiang. When I arrived at Nenjiang, the military situation was tense. The Central Route Army only had two brigades, Huang and Ma. Through Brother Chu's introduction, I met General Ma Zhanshan. At that time, his troops numbered only over three thousand, but their morale was high. Although Russia was arrogant, it did not dare to invade. How long has it been since the September 18th Incident occurred and the Northeast fell? Compatriots across the country were indignant and wanted to die. However, General Ma defended with a lone army and defended the country with loyalty and courage. Although he could not protect the territory for a while, his military might shocked the bandits. From then on, he shone brightly in the world, and I was fortunate to know him. I originally intended to pack my bags and go east, but because I was in Shanghai, I devoted myself to social work, only making propaganda to save the country, so that those who defend the country would be more successful. For the past two weeks, Jinzhou has fallen again, and Shanhaiguan is in danger again. Knowing that you are guarding the Luan River and protecting this remnant fortress, I predict that you will be the one to rise up after General Ma Zhanshan. I regret that I have received little military training in my life and find it difficult to wield a weapon and defend the country. However, I have a responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation. I plan to come north, hoping to offer some small assistance. I hope that you will maintain your consistent personality of matching words with actions, firmly defend Yuguan. The bandits may be fierce, but they will never be able to shake the soldiers touched by our sincerity. 'The city falls with us,' is an ancient saying. You have been in the military since you were young. If you can understand this, then someone as mediocre as I will have no more regrets. It is bitterly cold outside the pass. I pray that you will cherish your health for the sake of the country. My mind races as I write this telegram, and I cannot express all my thoughts. Sincerely, Sheng Minxiu."</p>
<h3>The Life Weekly's Announcement of the End of the Aid-to-Ma Donation Campaign</h3>
<p>▲Total Amount Reached Over 125,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Life Weekly initiated a campaign to raise funds to assist the patriotic soldiers in Heilongjiang Province, it has been trusted by people from all walks of life at home and abroad, who have enthusiastically donated and entrusted remittances. As of January 15th, the total amount received was 125,454.53 yuan. Of this amount, 106,507 yuan has already been received by General Ma (the receipts for each donation were specially made with copperplate and published in the magazine). Another 13,500 yuan is being processed for delivery through a bank in Harbin, and 5,447.53 yuan remains in the Shanghai bank. It is now learned that the magazine received a telegram from General Ma on January 5th from Hailun, stating that the current military pay is still self-sufficient and requesting that remittances be stopped to help the disaster victims. Therefore, it was decided to end the aid-to-Ma donation campaign on January 16th. Apart from continuing to remit the remaining funds that have already been donated and designated for aid to Ma in order to fulfill the donors' intentions, only disaster relief donations will be accepted in the future, and no more aid-to-Ma donations will be accepted for the time being. Furthermore, for the sake of ensuring the integrity of the various account books and receipts for this aid-to-Ma donation campaign, accountant Pan Xulun will be invited to audit them after the campaign is concluded and issue a certificate to be published in the magazine to complete the procedures.</p>

The Municipal Government believes that the organization of the Federation of Trade Unions has no legal basis and submitted a request to the Central Government for instructions on how to handle it. The Central Government then forwarded it to the National Government for handling. The Municipal Government received an order from the National Government, relayed by the Central Government, a few days ago, stating that the establishment of the North and South Municipal Federations of Trade Unions should be investigated and prevented in order to maintain the law and discipline and prevent disputes.

Upon review, the Merchant Movement Committee has no legal basis and has been ordered to be stopped by the Executive Yuan.

<h3>The Strike at the Cloth Weaving Section of the Japanese-Owned China Cotton Mill Was Resolved with a Breakdown in Mediation</h3>
<p>▲The Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus Reported to the Municipal Government for Review</p>
<p>After all the workers in the cloth weaving section of the Japanese-owned China Cotton Mill in Pudong went on strike, the Japanese used force to prevent them from returning to work. Despite repeated mediation by the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus, the mediation broke down due to the Japanese side's strong attitude. They reported to the Municipal Government for review. The workers, with no avenue for appeal and facing a precarious livelihood, had no choice but to convene another general assembly at the trade union at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss solutions. Chairman Zheng Xiechen: (1) Regarding the matter of how to handle the failure of the Social Affairs Bureau to negotiate with the seller on several occasions regarding the cloth weaving section turmoil, it was resolved to petition the Social Affairs Bureau for review again and to send representatives Huang Linxiang and Wang Haiqing, etc., to petition. (2) Regarding the matter of the employer canceling the monthly bonus for no reason and illegally dismissing a large number of workers, it was resolved to handle it in conjunction with item 1. (3) Regarding how to handle the contractor of the carrying-pole section violating the contract, it was resolved to send a letter ordering the contractor to submit the original prices for verification. (4) Regarding the request to punish the female yarn gatherer for fawning over the employer and forcibly confiscating the trade union certificates of female workers, it was resolved to send a letter ordering the association to severely reprimand her. (5) Regarding the prevention of female workers from collecting monthly fees for assisting workers in other sections by patrol police from the Fourth Squad while they are advising them outside the cloth weaving section, it was resolved to send a letter to the Third District Public Security Bureau to notify the Fourth Squad not to interfere. (6) Regarding the request to finalize the liquidation accounts for the December 20th year of the Republic of China and to publish the list, it was resolved to finalize and publish the list by the 30th of this month.

<h3>The Japanese Cotton Mills' Response to the Monthly Bonus Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>▲An Emergency Meeting of Representatives Was Held Yesterday</p>
<p>▲The Secret Meeting Adopted a Tough Stance</p>
<p>▲Unemployed Japanese Workers Are Likely to Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>Since over 30 Japanese-owned cotton mills in this city, including Rihua, employing over 60,000 Chinese workers, aroused a full-scale strike after the factories unilaterally canceled the monthly bonus, several days have passed without a solution. While the Japanese cotton mills are superficially maintaining a calm attitude, they are actually panicked. Since the East Incident occurred, our country, both from top to bottom, has been vigorously boycotting Japanese goods. The cotton textile industry in our port has been replacing Japanese raw materials with British goods. Japanese products are temporarily unable to sell, and the business has indeed suffered a drastic blow. By today, the inventory of each factory has gradually been sold out, and the business has slightly improved. However, the Japanese factories have always adopted a high-pressure policy towards Chinese workers. Therefore, after the occurrence of this strike, our party and government agencies sent personnel for mediation several times, but were rejected by the Japanese side. The conditions proposed by the workers have not been accepted. On the other hand, representatives from all Shanghai yarn factories were summoned to hold a joint meeting to find a fundamental solution. It has been learned that the Japanese Cotton Mills Association in China, seeing the increasingly serious situation of the Chinese workers' strikes in various factories recently, is discussing countermeasures, and no time can be lost. It specially convened an emergency joint meeting of representatives from various factories at 8:00 PM last night, which continued until 11:00 PM without adjourning. When the representatives of the Japanese cotton mills held the meeting, plainclothes Japanese were densely deployed around the meeting place. Only representatives with official certificates from the factory were allowed to enter. All others were uniformly refused to eavesdrop. Therefore, the content of the meeting is unknown. However, according to another source from the Japanese side, it is said that the emergency meeting will adopt a tough stance on the Chinese workers' strike events in various factories, insisting to the end and refusing to accept mediation from any party. If the Chinese workers do not return to work at the factories within the next ten days, their back wages will be settled, and they will be dismissed. Other Chinese workers will be recruited to supplement them. If Chinese workers cannot be recruited temporarily, workers from other countries or Japanese workers will be recruited as much as possible to temporarily maintain operations. At the same time, a telegram was sent urgently to the Osaka Textile Committee in China, requesting them to find ways to recruit a large number of unemployed Japanese people to come to Shanghai quickly to replace the work of Chinese workers.</p>

<p>▲ Crying for Food, Unable to Find Work</p>
<p>▲ Without Proper Relief, Reduced Entirely to Vagrants</p>
<p>The National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) Disaster Relief Committee specially dispatched two female officers, Tian Cuibao and Wang Fuying, to the disaster areas in Wuhan at the end of September last year to provide on-the-ground services. It has now been learned that Ms. Tian returned to Shanghai from Hongshan, Wuchang, the day before yesterday to report on the situation. According to her, there are over ten thousand flood victims residing in shelters in Wuhan. Since November 10 of last year, the Hubei Provincial Emergency Relief Association has ceased operations, and the porridge kitchens and temporary hospitals operated by various organizations have also gradually closed, causing widespread panic among the flood victims. Subsequently, the Emergency Relief Association issued five sheng of rice to each flood victim, ordering them to return to their hometowns. However, the flood victims still did not leave. Therefore, the Flood Relief Committee issued six jin of flour and a set of cotton clothing to each person. Recently, local philanthropists have provided each person with one sheng of rice and five jin of flour. Therefore, the flood victims are constantly at risk of starvation. However, the Relief Committee has established women and children's shelters in Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang, each capable of accommodating 2,000 people. A small number of philanthropists have also established children's shelters and orphanages in Wuchang, all of which have already reached their capacity of 500 children. As for the YWCA's shelter for orphans and the elderly in Hongshan, it is the first pilot shelter for orphans and the elderly in Wuhan. The shelter uses the Baotong Temple as its address. In addition to nurses, there are ten other staff members, all of whom are YWCA officers. Unfortunately, the shelter can only accommodate 300 orphaned and elderly flood victims. The remaining over 90,000 flood victims are unable to return to their hometowns and lack sufficient food to stay warm. Most pitiable is that diseases such as smallpox, measles, and dysentery are still prevalent. However, in Hongshan, for example, there are only three nurses for over 10,000 flood victims, and they are crying for food all day long, unable to find work. Cases of women selling themselves are frequently heard of. If this continues without proper relief measures, then these over 90,000 flood victims will all become vagrants.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Discusses Using New Measuring Instruments</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Soy and Rice Trade Association, the Rice Shop Trade Association, the Rice Milling Industry Association, the Nanshi Rice Merchants Association, and the Changshu Rice Merchants Association, etc., previously received orders to abolish all previous weights and measures and adopt the weights and measures of Shanghai Municipality as stipulated by the authorities. The associations have been rushing to produce dozens of city hu, city dou, city sheng, and other measures and have submitted them to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures for inspection and approval before distributing them to their members for use. In order to schedule the implementation of this matter, the associations specially dispatched representatives to hold a joint meeting at Cuixiu Hall at around 2:00 PM yesterday. After the temporary chairman, Zhu Zixiang, reported the purpose of the meeting, the old-style Haihu and the city hu were compared in terms of weight, and then a lengthy discussion was held. It was then decided that from February 10, 1932, all members of the associations would uniformly adopt the new-style city weights and measures. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Tobacco and Exchange Industry Opposes Increased License Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association's North Shanghai Office convened a meeting of all committee members at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the illegal increase of 20% in the tobacco and liquor license tax. Chairman Wang Chengdong resolved: (A) The association's main purpose is to protect the interests of its members. If the tobacco and liquor license tax is handled by the association, a letter should be sent to the association requesting a detailed report of the accounts to determine whether it is legal, so that it can be announced. (B) If it is not organized in the name of the association, the office should also protect the reports of its members according to the law.</p>
<h3>Additional Single Fee for Mail to Southern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Post Office, parcels sent to places such as Lijadu, Linchuan, Nancheng, Xuwan, Jinxi, Nanfeng, Chongren, Yihuang, Licuan, and Zixi in Jiangxi Province now require an additional single fee at the time of delivery, in addition to the prescribed rates, due to high transportation costs.</p>
<h3>Chicken and Duck Shops on the Bund Restricted to Relocate to Dongjiadu Within One Month</h3>
<p>▲ Joint Notice from the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the County Finance Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and the County Finance Bureau jointly notified the chicken and duck shops, stating that the Bund area is prosperous with bustling traffic and many pedestrians. The chicken and duck shops along the road obstruct traffic and sanitation. The Public Security Bureau has repeatedly ordered the first district in charge to strictly ban them. The County Finance Bureau has also stipulated that when the chicken and duck shops in the area renew their licenses, those with housing facilities must obtain a shop guarantee to ensure that chicken and duck cages are not placed along the road. Those who violate this will be punished before being granted a license. Open-air vendors will not be allowed to pay for licenses in order to rectify the situation and benefit traffic. Recently, it was found that 18 chicken and duck shops, including Yitaifeng, still placed chicken and duck cages along the road for open-air business, which is inappropriate. Therefore, Yitaifeng and other 18 chicken and duck shops are notified to relocate to a suitable location south of Dongjiadu within one month of receiving this notice, otherwise their licenses will be revoked and they will be ordered to close down in order to serve as a warning to others. You must abide by this. This notice is given to the chicken and duck shops on the [day] of January, 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>News from Shanghai on the Funeral of Mr. Chu Minyi's Father</h3>
<p>Mr. Xing Tian, father of Central Committee member Chu Minyi, was buried and had his memorial tablet enshrined on the 15th of this month. The funeral began on the 16th. Committee member Chu arrived in Xun on the afternoon of the 14th. Several hundred representatives from his hometown in Shanghai and various circles, including Zhou Xiangling, Zhou Peizhen, Wang Junqing, Lu Liankui, Shao Ruxin, Zhang Shouyong, Gao Lu, and Peng Shaoan, were present. Due to the recent incidents of robbery by bandits, Chu requested the Jiang-Zhe authorities to specially dispatch several naval vessels to protect the convoy. When they arrived at Dongpeng in Nanxun, the entire town's military police lined up to greet them. For a time, men, women, old, and young from all walks of life went to observe, and the road was blocked. It was truly an unprecedented display of mourning and honor.</p>
<h3>Theft of Over 20,000 Taels of Raw Silk</h3>
<p>▲ Hidden in the Home of Wang Yanchun</p>
<p>▲ The Case Was Tried and a Fine Was Imposed</p>
<p>The Ruilun Silk Factory, located at No. 217 Feilun Road, had 12 bundles of raw silk worth 27,000 taels of silver stolen between the 26th of last month. The case was reported to the Hongkou Police Department. Later, Chinese Detective Shi Deyu discovered that the stolen goods were hidden in the home of Wang Yanchun, a Hangzhou native, at No. 10 Yide Lane, Linyin Road, in the Chinese area of Nanshi. He secretly went with detectives from the Public Security Bureau there, arrested Wang, and learned that a portion of the original stolen goods had been sent to Ma Hanru, a native of Changzhou, a friend at the Xilin Temple on Xilin Road. They immediately went to the address, apprehended Ma, and brought back the stolen silk in three wooden boxes to the Police Department, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The stolen goods were first returned to the owner. Yesterday, Judge Jiang presided over a continued interrogation in the Third Criminal Court. Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case and questioned Wang Yanchun. Wang confessed that the silk belonged to a Zhang surname, his tenant, who said that he intended to open a sock factory and that the silk came from the sale of mortgaged goods from a certain Qianzhuang [money exchange]. He said that he knew Ma, so he temporarily sent the goods there. He said that he did not know that it was stolen goods and that the Zhang surname had already fled. Ma Hanru confessed that on the 27th of last month, Wang Yanchun delivered three wooden boxes of silk, saying that they were materials for his tenant, the Zhang surname, to weave socks, and that they would be taken away in a few days. He did not suspect that they were stolen goods of unknown origin. He asked the court for clarification and hired lawyer Fan Gang for his defense. Judge Jiang, after hearing the arguments of both lawyers, sentenced Wang Yanchun to a fine of 240 yuan and acquitted Ma Hanru. Police Lawyer Qian abandoned the appeal for Ma Hanru and released him in court.</p>
<h3>Detective Team Cracks Auto Theft Ring</h3>
<p>▲ Ring Located on Sanguantang Street, West Gate</p>
<p>▲ Previously Stole as Many as Nine Vehicles</p>
<p>Lu Yingjin, Captain of the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, having noted the increasing number of stolen car cases in both the Chinese and foreign concession areas, ordered his subordinates to conduct a thorough investigation. On the 10th of this month, he received a tip that he had identified a gang, led by Lin Quangen, specializing in stealing cars, dismantling them for sale, and secretly setting up a ring at home to hide stolen goods. The thieves were hiding at No. 73 Sanguantang Street, West Gate, and requested immediate arrest. After receiving the report, Captain Lu dispatched Detectives Zhang Yingpin, Li Xiaobao, Zhang Xinlong, Zhao Huairen, etc., to go to the address the next day with the court's warrant, and secretly went to No. 73 to arrest the suspects. Five suspects, including Lin Quangen, Cao Alin, Hu Fusheng, Guo Youfu, and Lin Wangshi, were arrested on the spot. One blue Chrysler sedan, one dark blue Chevrolet roadster, and one dismantled carriage were recovered. In addition, automobile licenses No. 11510, 2820, 6706, 5839, 11673, and 8680, totaling six vehicles, and numerous scattered parts such as horns, cylinders, screws, and other items used on vehicles, were found hidden under the floor. At the same time, the receiver of stolen goods, Zhu Yinhua, and a witness were arrested at No. 32 Tongguang Street and brought to the team. After personally interrogating them, Captain Lu learned that the thieves, including Lin Quangen, confessed to repeatedly stealing cars. The receiver of stolen goods, Zhu Yinhua, claimed that he did not know that the items were stolen goods and that he was selling them on behalf of others. Since the suspects had repeatedly stolen cars, as many as eight or nine vehicles in total, which was extremely illegal, he immediately prepared a document and submitted it to the Judicial Section for interrogation and handling along with the evidence.</p>
<h3>Another Embezzlement Lawsuit Arises in the Housheng Bonus Case</h3>
<p>▲ Jiang Zhonghe and Four Others Accused</p>
<p>▲ Plaintiff Must Supplement Procedures</p>
<p>Seven shareholders and directors of the Housheng Ziji Yarn Factory in Yangshupu, including Bei Runsheng and Xue Gansheng, were criminally prosecuted by representatives of the factory's employees, Jiang Zhonghe, Sun Kezhen, Xu Dianhuang, and Zhou Qichang, last winter for embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars in dividends over the years (from 1926 to 1929) in the First Special District Court. Judge Feng interrogated them several times without a conclusion. Later, the matter was settled through mediation for 59,000 yuan. After deducting mediation fees, legal fees, and all other expenses, the net amount was only 43,000 yuan. The employees, believing that they were entitled to more than 100,000 yuan, sued Jiang Zhonghe and the other three for fraud and breach of trust in the original court, Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xieben specially opened the Fifth Criminal Court to summon the defendants. The plaintiffs' representatives, Li Bo, Ying Chengzong, Xing Haoqi, and Li Jingfu, were chosen. Li Bo stated that during the litigation, at a meeting at the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road, it was said that at least 100,000 yuan or more must be obtained. This statement was made by Zhou Qichang, and the goal must be achieved. Unexpectedly, the result of the mediation was only 43,000 yuan net, which was far less than the expected amount. Please investigate. The defendant Jiang Zhonghe confessed that during the case, they were indeed chosen as representatives, and after a detailed investigation of the accounts, the amount that should have been obtained was no more than 59,000 yuan. After deducting the fees of the mediators Ma Changshu and Tang Jiapeng and lawyer fees of 16,000 yuan, the remaining amount should be distributed to the employees, and 130 people have already received it. Only 80 people have not received it. Furthermore, the funds from the factory were transferred by Ma and Tang. The confessions of the defendants Sun and Xu were the same. Zhou Qichang denied that he had said at the Central Hotel that 100,000 yuan or more must be obtained. Judge Xiao ordered the four defendants, including Jiang, to provide reliable shop guarantees, and ordered the plaintiffs to supplement the power of attorney procedures, and then set another date for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Pengpu Militia Captures a Giant Thief Who Climbs Walls</h3>
<p>▲ Escaped Twice after Being Handcuffed, Finally Captured</p>
<p>At around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, a thief was stealing lead sheets on the roof of the newly built Daxing Grocery Market at the intersection of Zhongxing Road and Datong Road in Zhabei. His method was to roll the entire new lead sheet into a roll like a bolt of cloth, and then carry it away to flee. This was probably not the first time. A member of the Pengpu Militia watching over the construction site discovered this, went forward to question him. The thief replied that he was a laborer. The militia member, knowing that it was theft, pretended not to notice and retreated, secretly reporting to the Second Team headquarters, and called a foreman, Mr. Jia, to assist several militia members in going to the scene. The thief was still seriously rolling up the lead sheets. Jia identified that he was not a laborer, so they arrested him and took him to the team headquarters. According to the interrogation, he confessed that his name was Chuan San, 26 years old, from Tongzhou, living at No. 3 Sanyili, Pushan Road. He has a 59-year-old mother, Yang, and an elder brother, Chuan Yi, 33 years old, and a second elder brother, Chuan Er, 28 years old, who all live by farming. He came to Shanghai more than a year ago and made a living by stealing. He has two scars on his right shoulder, which he said were marks from carrying salt illegally when he was at home, but they looked like knife scars. The team planned to send him to the vagrant factory, but the thief was very strong and could not be subdued by a small number of team members, so his hands were handcuffed to prevent accidents. However, the thief acted as if nothing had happened. At around 10:00 PM, he took advantage of the inattentiveness of others, stole the key, took off the handcuffs, and tried to escape. He was noticed by someone and relocked. This morning at around 2:00 AM, the team members were all asleep, with only one night watchman on duty at the door. The thief actually took off the handcuffs, escaped to the eaves of the building, jumped to the opposite wall to the entrance of the alley, saw someone on guard, jumped into the courtyard of No. 1 resident, and accidentally broke a flower pot in the dark, making a loud noise. Someone shouted for help, and he was captured again by the team. Yesterday, he was sent to the vagrant work practice center but was not accepted. He is still being held at the team headquarters, and it is unknown how to dispose of him. Yesterday, seeing that the thief's clothes were tattered and his eyes were sideways, everyone called him a giant of thieves.</p>
<h3>Child Dies After Taking Medicine, Doctor Accused</h3>
<p>Zhang Tingzhen, 47 years old, a native of Yanzhou, Shandong, residing at No. 47 Chongxin Workshop, Caojiadu, West Shanghai, worked as a factory worker. He had a son named Wu Jing, only ten years old, who was clever and loved by his father. However, the child had suffered from vomiting since childhood, sometimes recurring and sometimes recovering, so his body was very weak. Recently, due to the cold weather, the old illness recurred and was even more severe than before. His father, Tingzhen, specially invited Dr. Wang Dianchen, who lived at No. 1500 Jisi Fei Er Road, to his home for a diagnosis on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Wang immediately prescribed a prescription of three liang of licorice powder, a bottle of heart-pain pills, and two flavors of Maoshu and cloves to be decocted in soup and taken. Zhang Tingzhen took the prescription to the Gongjitang Pharmacy in the town to purchase the medicine, brought it home, and immediately prepared it and administered it. Unexpectedly, the child took half a dose of the medicine and, at around 10:00 PM, suddenly suffered from abdominal pain, gasped, and became congested. By the time the sky was about to break, he died. Tingzhen believed that the child's death was obviously caused by the quack doctor's murder and the wrong medicine. Yesterday morning, Tingzhen brought the medicine and evidence to the police station, arrested Dr. Wang Dianchen and Shi Yongsheng, a worker at the Gongjitang Pharmacy, and took them back to the Sixth District Police Station, requesting interrogation. After District Chief Ren interrogated the plaintiff Zhang Tingzhen and recorded the above statement, Dr. Wang Dianchen, 67 years old, a native of Qingfeng, Hebei, residing on Jisi Fei Er Road, admitted to prescribing the medicines. Shi Yongsheng, 26 years old, a native of Yangzhou, claimed that he gave the medicine according to the prescription and there was no mistake. After obtaining the confessions, District Chief Ren believed that the case involved accusations against the doctor for prescribing the wrong medicine and causing death, and he immediately prepared a document and sent it to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhong Zhangyao's Concubine-Taking Dispute Is Full of Troubles</h3>
<p>▲ Sometimes Gang Up for Intimidation, Sometimes Send Warning Letters</p>
<p>▲ Sometimes Bring Civil Lawsuits, Making It Difficult to Grasp</p>
<p>Chen Xiuying, a woman from Huzhou, Zhejiang, is 22 years old this year. When she was young, her mother betrothed her to Fan Dayong, a fellow villager, as his wife. Fan works in the military and is stationed in Han Gao. Due to his occupation, he has not yet discussed marriage. Unexpectedly, on May 18 of last year, Chen Xiuying suddenly changed her name to Ruizhi. Through the introduction of a woman named Shen Peizhen, she suddenly married Zhong Zhangyao as his concubine. On the 27th of that month, she changed her name to Jingfang and posted a notice in the newspaper warning her fiancé Fan Dayong. Fan saw the notice in the newspaper in Han and rushed to Shanghai to negotiate. At the same time, Fan's mother, Jiang, sued Zhong in the First Special Court for adultery. Subsequently, Zhong Zhangyao was acquitted. Fan then filed a lawsuit to confirm the marriage contract. While the lawsuit was in progress, Chen Xiuying suddenly ran away from Zhong's house and hired a lawyer to warn Zhong. Zhong carefully considered the situation and believed that there was a conspiracy to defraud him of money in the previous events. Therefore, he hired lawyers Xu Bingcheng and Xu Fuji to file a criminal complaint with the First Court against Chen Xiuying, Fan Dayong, Fan's mother Jiang, and Chen's mother, accusing them of conspiracy to defraud him of money. The reason was that Ruizhi (i.e., Xiuying) claimed after entering the house that her ex-husband was Jin Baimin and that she had a son, but because both her husband and son had died, she had no way to survive and had to remarry. However, within ten days, she came up with a whimsical idea, changed her name to Jingfang, and posted a notice in the newspaper warning her fiancé Fan Dayong to come to discuss the matter as soon as possible. Fan soon came and asked Zhong to compensate him for his losses, at least 2,000 yuan. Zhong entrusted a lawyer to pay the money and break off the engagement with Fan. Unexpectedly, they then ganged up to file a criminal complaint, which failed. Then they filed a civil lawsuit against Chen, requesting confirmation of the marriage contract. Zhong ignored it. Seeing that their purpose could not be achieved, Chen Ruizhi swept away the jewelry and ran away. Moreover, she hired a lawyer to warn Zhong, and the lawyer they hired was Huang Xiubo, Fan Dayong's agent. Shanghai, located in a corner, is a gathering place for all evils, so fraud is rampant, setting up scams and releasing pigeons. It happens almost every day. However, Chen Ruizhi's various behaviors, sometimes ganging up for intimidation, sometimes sending warning letters, sometimes bringing criminal lawsuits, and sometimes bringing civil lawsuits, not only make it impossible for people to grasp, but also make people exhausted to deal with them. She has the means of a god. Her design is ingenious, and her intentions are sinister, which is very different from the general pigeon releasers. If she is not severely punished according to the law, the harm to society in the future will be unimaginable. It is requested that the defendants be punished with the punishment they deserve according to Article 363 of the Criminal Law, and that the clothing and other losses be recovered. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Gongliang opened the court to summon the defendants. First, Zhong Zhangyao and his agent lawyer Xu Bingcheng stated the intent of the prosecution. Chen Xiuying confessed that she was still young when her parents betrothed her to Fan Dayong, so she did not know about it. Last year, she came to Shanghai and wanted to work in a silk factory but failed. Through the introduction of Shen Peizhen, she married Zhong as his wife. At that time, it was made clear that she was to be a stepmother, but unexpectedly she was a concubine. However, what is done cannot be undone. Judge Jiang believed that the case required the summon of the matchmaker Shen Peizhen, so he ordered that the case be adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Xi Yaojin and His Brothers Were All Stabbed</h3>
<p>▲ Resentment Due to Forcing Debt Collection</p>
<p>Xi Yaojin, a 32-year-old native of Wuxi, lives at No. 885 Wenxingfang, Baikai Er Road, and works as a worker in the Huaan Box Factory at No. 13 Huaji Road. Yesterday evening, he returned home with his brothers A San and Yaohai for dinner. Just as they sat down, more than 30 thugs holding axes and iron rulers broke into the gate and stabbed the three brothers. All three suffered serious injuries. Later, the police arrived and sent the injured to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that one of the assailants was known to Xi, surnamed Yu, named Quanlin, who owed Xi Yaojin money. Xi constantly demanded repayment from him, and he harbored resentment in his heart, so he gathered a group of hooligans to commit this crime.</p>
<h3>Imprisonment for Falsely Claiming Official Status to Extort Money</h3>
<p>▲ Zhang, Tong, and Qiu Each Sentenced to One Year in Prison</p>
<p>Zhang Jifu, Tong Jianzhong, and Qiu Yaoshan obtained a forged white silk letter of appointment from Zheng Guoping, a native of Taizhou, stating that Wu Zhuowei, a division commander of the Fourth Group Army of Guangdong, appointed Qian Jingren as deputy brigade commander. At 9:00 AM on December 14 of last year, they gathered a group to the home of Wu Zhuohui (i.e., Zhuowei), a native of Jinhua and former captain of the Liang-Zhe Anti-Smuggling Brigade, at No. 1 Lianyifang, Xiafei Road, French Concession, accusing Wu of posing as a division commander and issuing letters of appointment indiscriminately. They claimed that the National Government had offered a reward of 5,000 yuan for his arrest. At the time, Zhang posed as a detective from the French Concession, and Qiu posed as a detective from the Siyu Department. They told Wu that the National Government had official business with the Jiangsu Security Team, which would transfer it to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for the French Concession police to assist in the arrest. If he could pay 2,000 yuan, they could find a way to let him escape. Wu did not have money at home, so he invited his friend Hu Shuang to borrow 100 yuan, which he paid first, and agreed to pay the rest the following afternoon. At 10:00 AM on the 16th, Zhang and the other two went to Wu's place to collect the money. Wu notified the Guanlong Police Station and reported to the French Concession Police Station. Detectives Liu Jinrong and Miao Yongxing went to arrest Zhang and the other two, sent them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention, and then arrested Zheng Guoping, retrieved the forged letter of appointment, and sent them to the Court Police Station for prosecution on charges of extortion under Article 370 of the Criminal Law. The case was previously reported. Judge Luo Renji repeatedly held court hearings. The defendants, except for Zheng Guoping, who hired a lawyer to represent him, were assigned pro bono lawyers by the court. After the debate was declared over, the date for sentencing was set. Yesterday was the date of sentencing. At 10:00 AM, Judge Luo presided over the First Criminal Court, ordered the defendants to be brought to court, and sentenced Zhang Jifu, Tong Jianshan, and Qiu Yaoshan to one year of imprisonment each for the crime of jointly using their illegal actions to extort the possessions of another through intimidation. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined to be two days offsetting one day of imprisonment. Zheng Guoping was acquitted.</p>
<h3>Robbers Wandering with Guns Planning to Rob</h3>
<p>▲ Pretending to Urinate When They See Detectives Approaching</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaosan and Yang Zewu, two robbers from Jiangbei, were wandering on the French Concession's Sapo Sai Road with handguns at around 2:00 AM the night before last, hoping to rob passersby of their property. They were discovered by Detective Zhang Daorong of the Fourth French Concession Police Station and arrested. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Special Court. First, Police Lawyer Gu Shouxian stated that the police charged them with attempted robbery under Article 348, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Law. The defendants were seen on Sapo Sai Road hoping to rob passersby of their property. When the detective passed by, the first defendant squatted on the ground, pretending to defecate, and the second defendant was talking on the side. After a while, the second defendant also squatted on the ground, pretending to urinate. The detective found their situation suspicious and arrested them. Later, a handgun was found under a brick in the grass and brought to the police station. Due to the limited time, they were unable to investigate and requested a postponement to investigate whether the defendants had committed other crimes before sending them for interrogation. The detective also reported the circumstances of the arrest of the two defendants. After Judge Luo briefly interrogated the defendants, he ordered them to be returned to custody and waited for a continued hearing on a later date.</p>
<h3>Sentencing for Forcibly Taking Over a Trade Union</h3>
<p>Li Changgui, Zhang Tingsheng, Li Menggeng, and others, on the morning of December 21st of last year, under the name of the Shanghai Special Municipality Workers' Sports Committee, led a mob of over thirty people, wielding iron bars and other weapons, and stormed into the Pudong Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union, intending to forcibly take it over. Unexpectedly, the union had been forewarned and was well-prepared, resulting in Li and others being ambushed and captured on the spot. They were transferred to the Third District Police Station and then handed over to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Subsequently, the other followers were deemed to be uninvolved and were ordered to be released. The principal culprits in the case, Li and the other two, were transferred to the local court. After repeated hearings, a verdict has been announced: Li Changgui, Zhang Tingsheng, and Li Menggeng were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment for the crime of publicly gathering a crowd to use violence and intimidation to assist in the takeover; and each fined fifty yuan for the crime of jointly damaging the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, to be executed concurrently. If the fines were not paid after compulsory execution, they would be converted to imprisonment at the rate of two yuan per day. The number of days of detention prior to the final judgment would be deducted from the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The five long and short iron bars and three badges were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Refugees Passing Through Lujiadu</h3>
<p>Yesterday evening, over sixty refugees, men and women, from Zhengyang County, Henan, arrived at the Lujiadu Wharf in Pudong. Since they had no place to stay, they sat on the ground by the roadside. Subsequently, the refugee representatives Yan Jiuru and Yang Fuyun, carrying passports, went to the Third District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting relief. District Chief Zhang intends to instruct the local bailiffs to raise travel expenses and quickly order them to leave the area to avoid causing trouble by lingering.</p>
<h3>Grand Joint Celebration of Six Major Companies</h3>
<p>The six major companies in the local financial sector, presided over by Lei Wenbai, Dong Mao, Bain, and Sun Dao, namely Puyi Trust Company, Puyi Real Estate Company, Meifeng Bank, Meidong Banking Company, Guangyi Real Estate Company, and Puyi Advertising Company, have experienced rapid business growth and a surge in staff in recent years. In order to strengthen the bonds among the colleagues of these companies and banks, a joint celebration for all employees was held last night (the 15th) at the International Recreation Club on Jing'an Temple Road. In addition to tea and refreshments, there were various recreational activities, including Chinese and Western string music, silk and bamboo instruments, solo singing, competitions, comedy, and magic. Over three hundred Chinese and Western ladies attended, creating a scene of shimmering hairpins and flowing skirts, like clouds. Gathering talents in one hall and enjoying conversation over tea and refreshments, it was indeed a grand event.</p>
<h3>The Eurasia Air Route to Be Realized in March</h3>
<p>▲ Board of Directors to Meet Soon to Discuss Everything</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Berlin Eurasia air route has been actively pursued since the successful trial flight of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation on the Northwest route. The Northwest route's operability means that the route from Shanghai to Berlin can pass through the Northwest, entering Russia and then Germany. According to sources from the company yesterday, the board of directors is scheduled to meet soon to decide on the purchase of aircraft for the Northwest route from Germany and to discuss the official flight date. It is currently anticipated that the route can be opened in March of this spring. The route will be from Shanghai to Dihua in Xinjiang, from Dihua to Tacheng on the border with Russia, and then from Tacheng across the Russian border to Berlin. It is estimated that the journey between Shanghai and Berlin will only take five to six days, which is much faster than the route through Manchuria, Irkutsk, and into Germany.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Commercial Transportation on the Yangtze River Line</h3>
<p>▲ Reduced Load and Increased Freight Rates</p>
<p>▲ Navigation Marks and Lightships Remain Open</p>
<p>▲ The Great Recession of River Water: During last year's major flood in Wuhan, sand and mud on both banks of the Yangtze River were washed away and subsided, accumulating at the bottom of the river. Since winter, the river water has receded sharply, resulting in an unprecedented drought. The water level in the Xun and Wan sections is only above nine feet. Yesterday, a telegram from Hankou stated that the water level had dropped to eight feet seven inches, making it impossible for large river steamers to pass.</p>
<p>▲ Customs Erects Marks: At Taiziji in the lower reaches of Anqing, many commercial vessels were stranded due to the receding river water, numbering as many as seven. It has now slightly increased to ten feet. In order to maintain traffic on the Yangtze River, the Jianghai Customs has dispatched survey vessels to the area to erect markers in shallow waters, allowing river steamers to avoid them. Marker lights are added at night to prevent them from mistakenly entering shallow waters again. This has already been implemented.</p>
<p>▲ Scheduled Vessels Not Suspended: After the river steamers were pulled out of the shallows and sailed to Hankou, in view of the fact that the river water could not rise immediately, the Sanbei, Fengpu, Xinning, Xing and other vessels sent telegrams to Shanghai to inquire whether the general office would suspend scheduled services and wait for the water to rise before resuming operations. Yesterday, it was heard that the companies had agreed that the scheduled vessels would not be suspended no matter how shallow the water was. It was also agreed that vessels going up and down the river would only be allowed to load up to 40% of their capacity. It is feared that many merchants will be delayed.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<h3>Continued Increase in Water Freight Rates</h3>
<p>The Yangtze River shipping companies had already agreed to increase shallow water freight rates by 15% from the 16th of last month. However, at that time, it was only limited to goods going to the ports of Gou and Han in the upper reaches, while Anqing, Wuhu, and other places were not increased. Now, due to the decline in water levels in both the upper and lower reaches, the companies held another meeting yesterday and decided to revise the previously set shallow water freight rates. Starting tomorrow, the previously increased 15% will be cancelled, and the shallow water freight rate for goods transported from Shanghai to Jiujiang and Hankou will be increased by 30%. After the public discussion and decision yesterday, a notice was issued to all passengers and merchants.</p>
<h3>Ye Xiasheng Advocates Improving National Defense Organization</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Ye Xiasheng, a former National Assembly member of the Kuomintang, issued a telegram yesterday advocating the improvement of national defense organization. The original text is as follows: To the members of the Central Party Headquarters of Nanjing, the Chairman of the National Government, all members, the heads of all ministries and commissions, the military and civilian officials of the capital and various provinces, all legal entities, all newspapers, all celebrities out of office, Mr. Wang Jingwei of Shanghai, Ms. Soong Ching Ling, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek of Fenghua, Mr. Hu Hanmin of Hong Kong, Mr. Yan Xichuan of Taiyuan, Mr. Feng Huanzhang of Nanjing, Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Beiping, and Mr. Ma Zhanshan of Hailun, for your consideration. Since the national crisis occurred, all of us commoners, and even patriotic compatriots, have been hoping that the authorities will analyze the situation and adapt accordingly, and make plans as soon as possible. Gu Weijun, the Ningyue government, all regard unified national salvation and decide on the success or failure of peace negotiations. Fortunately, a government of united and unanimous opposition to foreign countries has been established. However, the political structure has three commissions, but it has not yet entered the capital, and the special affairs committee has also been organized. The veteran heroes are the pillars of the country, and they need to choose a place to preside over the overall plan. The Japanese Saionji and others all live permanently in the mountains and forests, but what is the difference in deciding on plans and resolving doubts? Moreover, at a time of emergency and survival, when the situation is critical, saving the country is not a matter of humility, and saving the country is not a time for concession. I know that the three elders are in the forest springs, but they have the party and the country in their hearts. The overall plan has been decided long ago, and there is no need to wait for the elders. However, what the people of the country have not yet finished hoping for is that in this extraordinary change, the whole country is in a state of crisis and shock, like suffering from a sudden illness. Emergency treatment can only treat the symptoms, and it cannot be saved by ordinary soup. Looking at the beginning of the European War, even in the advanced constitutional country of England, in the face of German aggression, it could not follow the old ways. Lei Zuo Zhi used the general superintendent of military supplies to form a national defense cabinet, which supported the crisis for several years. Today, China's crisis is a hundred times greater than England's. The enemy is at hand, and the daily reduction is hundreds of miles, but it is said that we can calmly sit and discuss, and bow our hands to govern. Can we or can we not? The people of the country already look to the government to deal with foreign affairs, and the government still does not comfort the people with foreign affairs, then it is not only contrary to the nature of the people, but also the world has never gained the trust of the people as it does today. If we lose this good opportunity for the whole country to unite, and do not mention the efforts of the whole country to deal with the national crisis, if the people of the country cannot seek it from the government, can they not save themselves together? Then what can the government say? I think that the officials in charge of our party and country should urgently respond to the people's hearts and quickly change the current government into a national defense organization. (A) Elect responsible persons with military and financial strength from all over the country, establish national defense government ministries and commissions, and strive to put their words into action and implement plans. And follow the example of the European War and set up several marshals of the navy, army, and air force, who are solely responsible for national defense. (B) Announce a general mobilization of all sectors of the country, suspend non-urgent government affairs, personnel, and consumer goods, and professions that are not suitable for war preparations, and order them to be changed to war preparation industries. (C) Implement national compulsory military service and compulsory labor service. One out of every two adults is conscripted to ensure that there are no surplus adults in the room and all are used for war preparations. (D) All factories, vehicles, and machines in the country shall be changed to direct and indirect war preparations. (E) All students of school age and professional personnel from all walks of life in the country shall be compiled into volunteer military service. (F) Follow the example of European and American citizens to bear war expenses, issue national defense bonds of 400 million yuan, and distribute and sell them in five years, so that each national will bear two yuan of war expenses per year. At the same time, establish a National Defense Fund Committee, which will be openly distributed and used by all sectors of the country to provide war preparations and to reorganize finances. (G) Each area with 1,000 people in the country shall set up a national shooting range, and the government shall supervise the implementation of live ammunition or reduced-medicine shooting, and stop all recreational sports. (H) During the national crisis, with a guarantee method, the people shall be allowed to freely possess self-defense guns. (I) During the national crisis, allow the Green Forest and the Communist Party to surrender and atone for their crimes. (J) During the national crisis, grant an amnesty once and forcibly conscript prisoners for military service and labor service, so that they can rehabilitate themselves. The above ten strategies are to revitalize the people's spirit and strengthen national power. If there is no other way, the government can truly determine the time limit and implement it in a unified manner on a specific date, and predetermine the implementation period on the day the national defense government is established, so as to relieve the people's difficulties. In this way, the day the national defense government is established will be the time when the people unanimously oppose foreign countries. Not only can it concentrate the strength of the whole country and unify the will of the whole country, but also the current chaotic political situation can avoid the futile efforts of neglecting cooperation. Even if the people of the country endure the pain for a moment, they will eventually reap the benefits in the long run. Even in diplomatic negotiations, it can truly receive the power of a solid backing. The rise and fall of the nation, the safety of the party and the country, depend on this move. The officials care about the national crisis and must have sympathy. Whether or not my humble opinion is appropriate, please guide and decide on it. I am an incompetent commoner who has been abandoned for a long time, and I should not raise my head and talk about national affairs. However, I have followed the Prime Minister for more than 20 years, witnessed the difficulty of creation, and participated in the development of the grass roots. How can I bear to sit idly by and watch the beautiful rivers and mountains be captured by our party? I feel that it is dangerous, so I dare not be silent. I shed tears and make a statement, hoping to be enlightened. Ye Xiasheng.</p>

<h3>Recent News from the Youth Support Ma Group</h3>
<p>▲ Organizing a Vanguard Team to Depart for the Front Line for a Bloody Battle</p>
<p>Since the Youth Support Ma Group left Shanghai last month for Yi, the situation along the way has been reported in various newspapers in this city. The group arrived in Beiping on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month by train from Pukou on the 30th of last month, passing through Xuzhou, Jinan, Tianjin and other places. Except for a few who could not endure hardship and those with "five-minute heat," most of them remained in Beiping and intensified military and political training, and organized a vanguard team to prepare to depart for the front line for a bloody battle. The rear advisory office of the group received a letter from the group yesterday, reporting on the recent situation of the group and the situation along the way to Beiping in detail. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Detention at Pukou Station: The group departed from Jinling University in Nanjing on the morning of the 28th of last month and arrived at Pukou Station. Due to the sudden drop in temperature and the flying snow in the air, many members of the group were thinly clothed. The leader of the group, Zhang Shaojie, instructed to temporarily park the train at the station and prepare coats on the other side of the river. The clothing problem was solved on the 30th, and then the special train departed, arriving in Xuzhou on the morning of the 31st.</p>
<p>▲ Welcome in Xuzhou: After the group arrived in Xuzhou, local people from all walks of life held a meeting at the Public Education Hall at 10:00 a.m. to welcome them. Many groups attended, totaling several thousand people. There were extremely passionate speeches. They left Xuzhou for the north at 2:00 p.m. on the first day. Representatives from all walks of life saw them off at the station and presented two flags.</p>
<p>▲ The Train Travels North: After leaving Xuzhou and heading north, the train did not stop at any stations along the way. On the morning of the 2nd, the train stopped in Jinan. The provincial government specially sent people to the station to welcome them, and the municipal government sent porridge and steamed buns to the station for the members to eat. At 1:10 p.m. on the 3rd, they arrived in Tianjin and stopped for two hours before changing trains to Beiping.</p>
<p>▲ Situation Upon Arrival in Beiping: They arrived in Beiping at about 4:00 p.m. on the 3rd. The train stopped at Fengtai, the station before Beiping. The Pacification Commissioner of Ping Sui specially sent an adjutant to inquire about everything. After arriving at the Qianmen Railway Station, the Commissioner's Office sent people to greet them and get off the train. The leader led the members into the city on foot and temporarily borrowed the Industrial University in Duan Wangfu Alley.</p>
<p>▲ General Situation of the Group: Since leaving Nanjing, the group has expelled one member for bad behavior and added five members. Mr. Bao Keming, who rushed from Suzhou to Beiping to register, has also joined. Now there are a total of 249 members of the group in Beiping. The office is now located in the Industrial University in Beiping. It plans to intensify military training in the shortest possible time and prepare everything for departure to the front.</p>

Yesterday, he specially ordered officials to summon the township chiefs who defaulted on grain taxes to urge them to pay within a time limit. However, Zhou Zhenqing, the township chief of the Third District of Beiqiao, and others defaulted on grain taxes and delayed payment, intending to embezzle them.

<h3>An Answer Regarding Domestic Goods Manufacturing: Heart Show</h3>
<p>Our. Nation's. Yarn. Factory. Urgently. Needs. To. Self. Manufacture. Necessary. Items.</p>
<p>I am an employee of a domestic goods yarn factory (now foreign goods factories, usurping the role of the host, are filling the country, so I added the words "domestic goods" to distinguish them and express my grief). Although the equipment management in our factory cannot be said to be perfect, it is not so corrupt either. But I silently observe the present and consider the future, and I deeply feel that if we do not urgently seek improvement, not only will we not be able to develop, but I fear that even the previous prolonged existence will be impossible. Now, based on my limited perspective, I summarize that we should have a strict organization, complete facilities, and management that combines leniency and strictness. The machinery should be new and advanced, and the skills of the workers should be refined. The so-called</p>
<p>facilities should be scientific, the work should be standardized, and the technology should be mechanized. But the most important and fundamental method should be to quickly prepare to manufacture our own materials, such as lubricating oil and towing machine belts. Although these two items seem very small, we cannot manufacture them ourselves and rely on foreign goods. Once a war unfortunately occurs, or there is a boycott and the source is cut off, all machines will be forced to stop working, affecting the entire factory's operation. This matter, though small, can be used to understand larger issues. Another point that everyone should pay attention to is that we have been establishing modern textile industries for more than forty years, but the total number of spindles is only two million four hundred thousand. Therefore, Rong, the general manager of Wuxi Shenxin Yarn Factory, in order to expand the domestic textile industry, previously suggested to the government to borrow foreign spindles. After several consultations, the government has agreed to use the Boxer Indemnity of 1.3 million pounds as collateral to borrow 600,000 spindles from the United Kingdom. Adding one-quarter to the original number will increase production, which is certainly a fortunate event, but we still have to find a way to manufacture them ourselves, and not always rely on foreign spindles, so as not to be controlled by foreigners and plug the huge leakage. Our country's</p>
<p>yarn factory authorities should open their eyes to the future and make a permanent plan. If they seek only short-term gains and take advantage of the current opportunity to boycott Japanese goods, hoping to obtain huge profits, only considering the present and not the future, then I am afraid that once the wave of boycotts subsides, the yarn industry in our country, which is now flourishing, will suddenly show a miserable and depressed state again. Of course, the manufacture of domestic goods is not limited to the materials of yarn factories alone. I hope that for all the raw materials and items needed by various industries that are lacking in our country, everyone should study, pool their efforts and talents, and cooperate to manufacture them. Only in this way can we fundamentally promote domestic goods and boycott foreign goods. May our countrymen work hard and actively strive for this. (Bing)</p>

<h3>An Indication of Japanese Internal Conflict with China</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Japan and our country are both located in East Asia. According to history, in the 28th year of Qin Shi Huang's reign, he toured the east, sealed Mount Tai, and performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices at Liangfu. He then toured the sea, seeking immortals. He also crossed the river south, touring the counties in the east, and summoned Confucian scholars from Lu. He returned to the foot of Mount Tai to discuss the Feng and Shan sacrifices. Afterwards, he toured the sea to the east, sacrificing to the eight gods of mountains and rivers. He ascended Langya to the south. Song Wuji and Xianmen Zigao from Yan claimed to have the Dao of Immortality, with the techniques of dissolving and transforming the body. Therefore, he sent people into the sea to seek Penglai, Fangzhang, and Yingzhou. It was said that these three divine mountains were in the Bohai Sea, where immortals and the elixir of immortality were. Thereupon, a Fangshi, Xu Fu (or Xu Shi), submitted a memorial, requesting to be allowed to fast and with three thousand young men and women to seek them. As soon as he entered the sea, the ships encountered the sea, and they all used the wind as an explanation, saying, "We have not been able to reach them, but we have seen them." However, there is no record of his return. Therefore, those who have studied this historical site have repeatedly doubted and could not believe it. However, the ancestor of the three islands must undoubtedly belong to Xu.</p>
<p>However, there are no records in Japanese historical books. It is said that because of racial relations, it was feared that it would be detrimental to the future progress of the country, so it was deleted. Only a type of burial code remains in the secret cabinet. Three years ago, I heard from a gentleman who had traveled to the East that Xu Fu's tomb is indeed located near Shingu Town near Kishu Kumanoura in Japan. Its area is extremely vast. The tombstone stands tall, and ancient cypresses reach the sky, with a circumference that can be encompassed. There are seven tombs of those who were buried with him nearby, all with inscriptions that can be examined. They are scattered in the "Continued Topography of Kii". I regret not having seen it. Therefore, the details of Xu's eastward crossing have not been collected. To verify its belief. Yesterday, from Qin Jun Jiliao, I obtained a book "Records of Countries East of the Sea", which contains, "The first emperor liked the immortal method, and ordered Xu Fu to lead three thousand young men and women, carrying grain seeds and hundreds of tools, to go to Penglai to seek it. Not finding it, he feared punishment. He dared not return. At that time, it was the 72nd year of Emperor Kōrei in Japan. He then entered the Japanese nationality.” Therefore, Xu's departure and no return can be verified in this book.</p>
<p>I still remember that in the 26th and 27th years of the Qing Guangxu period, the envoy to Japan, Li Shuchang, crossed the sea to visit his tomb and wrote a record of it. Unfortunately, his text cannot be found now. Otherwise, it will definitely be possible to find its origin. The first record of the islanders wearing grass garments can be found in "Tribute of Yu". Since the Han Dynasty, there have been no reports of Japanese pirates. This is because they want to love fresh flowers, and the land is rich and fertile. The five states and seven roads, and the five hundred and seventy-three counties of the three islands, are all happy lands. Surrounded by the sea, the rulers and ministers protect themselves and do not admire China. Those who study human races also believe that because their land belongs to Asia and their skin color is also yellow, and their surnames, lifestyles, and customs are no different from those in China, except for the Ezo of Hokkaido, who are completely different. This can be compared with Ji Zi being enfeoffed in Korea and Zheng Chenggong's refuge in Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is not unfounded. It is said that today people with the surname Qin are mostly descendants of Fu and are extremely prosperous. Since the Meiji Restoration, they began to change to other surnames. There is a Fujisawa Station Fukuoka Heiichirō, who is a descendant of Fu. And the famous doctor Xu of Wakayama Prefecture is a direct descendant of Kangzong. Although there are no genealogies to prove it, the bloodline of Xu must be abundant. Today, the wooden clogs forget where they came from, and are competing with China. If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold. Only considering aggression as a good strategy, alas. I recite the sentence "We are originally from the same root, why are we so eager to harm each other?", and I am not only sad for myself, but also regret it for them.</p>
<h3>Feng Huanzhang and Jiang Jieshi</h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang and Jiang Zhongzheng were originally sworn brothers. How their two people’s views and policies about governing the party and state, will be discussed later. Now, I will only describe one or two anecdotes for after-dinner conversation.</p>
<p>When Jiang and Feng met for the second time in Zhengzhou, Ma Fuxiang was Feng's confidant at the time. Seeing that the two were determined to cooperate, he persuaded them to exchange pledge cards and become brothers. Jiang and Feng agreed. So, they exchanged sworn brotherhood agreements with the ancestral three generations records, and became brothers of different surnames. Later, Mr. Ma often said to people, "I was the matchmaker for Jiang and Feng's sworn brotherhood." He was happy and joyful.</p>
<p>Although Jiang and Feng became brothers, Feng's salutation to Jiang's telegrams was always with "respectful start”. The salutation at the top always called him "Commander-in-Chief Revered Examination", and the title was "Your Excellency". The closing signature was "Your subordinate Feng Yuxiang". Jiang immediately sent a letter of humble refusal, saying that their friendship was like siblings, and they should not address each other in this way. In the future, please continue to call each other as brothers, which is more intimate. Feng then stated that public affairs are public, and private matters cannot be abolished. Although private friendship is as brothers, in terms of official duties, he is a superior and I an subordinate, and I must do so. If so, then both agreed that except for public affairs, the words "Your Excellency" etc. should still be used, and for everything else they would call each other "Brother Jieshi" and "Little Brother Xiang" etc. to show the distinction and to maintain both public and private matters.</p>
<p>When Jiang went north to Lanfeng to meet Feng, and Feng invited Jiang to review the troops, the troops stationed in Lanfeng happened to be those of Shi Yousan. The Northwest Army was famous for its well-disciplined forces, especially the Shi Army. The soldiers' swordsmanship was superb, making the viewers dazzled and astonished. Then he ordered the officers to demonstrate the pole climbing technique. Shi Yousan showed off his skills on the spot, took off his military uniform, and went bare-chested on the pole. He thoroughly demonstrated his unique skills. Jiang praised him in admiration. Shi joined Feng's army at the age of sixteen. He was intelligent and agile. From the time he was a soldier to the time he became a junior officer, he always topped his class in the tactical exams. The pole climbing technique was his unique skill, and he could be called the best in the entire army.</p>
<h3>The Tomb of Li Fengjie</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>When I went to Zhangjiakou in the past, I walked from Nankou across the Juyong Pass, climbed the Badaling, and arrived at Qinglongqiao, taking a tour of the Great Wall. One day, I and my friend Yan Wenjin went to the tomb of Li Fengjie. Enduring dangers and climbing steep slopes, we finally reached the place. The tomb is located on the ridge of Badaling, north of the Juyong Pass, backed by mountains and facing the valley. The white soil is bright and clean. There are several dilapidated houses nearby, all moved in by people from Huailai, who are engaged in sheep herding. According to the local people, there used to be thirty or forty households, half Manchu and half Han. Later, due to the continuous cycle of soldiers and bandits, many moved south to Changping. However, the ruins and broken tiles still remain. The most peculiar thing is that among the dark blue mountains and black peaks, which are interlaced for hundreds of miles, and the steep cliffs that stand thousands of feet high, how could there be a pile of white soil to bury a fragrant soul? Today, the remaining steles and broken pillars are indistinguishable. However, the local people have passed down the story that the tomb was originally yellow soil, but it suddenly turned into white fat after being struck by lightning. Later generations dismissed this as a lie and said that Fengjie returned to the capital with the emperor in the same carriage at that time. However, the official history does not record it because it involves reversal and appropriation. Therefore, later generations have no way to judge its authenticity. Only in the anecdotes of the wild scholars is there a description of the romantic affair of Emperor Zhengde of the Ming Dynasty playing with dragons and phoenixes, which proves that Fengjie died suddenly on the way. The tomb on Badaling is undoubtedly Fengjie's. When Chen Hao rebelled, the Emperor went on a personal expedition. On the way to Xuanhua, the Emperor went out in disguise and suddenly saw a woman in a tavern. She was about fifteen or sixteen years old, with a graceful appearance. The Emperor carefully examined her and became increasingly infatuated. The Emperor saw that there was no one in the tavern and entered the tavern to buy wine. At that time, Fengjie's father was out, so Fengjie was tending the stove. Because Fengjie brought wine to the seat, the Emperor mistakenly thought that she was a prostitute. His soul was shaken, and he suddenly embraced her. Fengjie screamed. The Emperor covered her mouth and said, "I am the Emperor. If you follow me, wealth and honor can be achieved immediately." Before that, Fengjie had a dream that she had turned into a bright pearl and was being played with by a blue dragon. Suddenly, she turned into smoke and clouds and dissipated. Hearing the Emperor's words, she suddenly realized and allowed the Emperor to close the door. Her silk dress was loosened, and she was still a virgin. The Emperor was overjoyed. At that time, Fengjie's father heard the shouts and rushed to rescue her. The door was tightly locked. He quickly called for help from the guard, who swarmed in. They suspected that it was a thief. When the door opened, the Emperor stood with his sword, and the soldiers prostrated themselves. The Emperor scolded them and ordered them to send Fengjie back to the Leopard Room, ennobled her father as a third-rank minister, and bestowed a thousand taels of gold. He wanted to ennoble Fengjie as a concubine and ordered her to choose for herself. Fengjie firmly declined. The Emperor saw that her black dress made her even more charming, so he did not force her to change her palace clothes. Later, the Emperor wanted to return to the capital with Fengjie in the same carriage. When they arrived at Juyong Pass, the wind and thunder roared. Feng also saw the four large stone statues carved at the entrance of the Pass, their faces lifelike. She became dizzy and fell off her horse. The Emperor personally helped her up and retreated quickly. He stationed at the traveling palace. Fengjie knew that her fortune was thin and that she could not pass the palace ban. She persuaded the Emperor to return quickly. The Emperor could not bear to abandon her. Fengjie cried bitterly and died. The Emperor ordered her to be buried on the mountain of the Pass, with special honors. The yellow soil tomb was used, and it turned into white fat overnight. It can be said that the spirit did not dare to accept it. Although this is the saying of the "Yan Shu", those who personally visited Fengjie's tomb on Badaling today all believe that the Shandong Li Bai lamented that his origin was correct. Moreover, the official history also records that the Emperor was in the Leopard Room and that the officials presented memorials to persuade him, but he did not accept them. He suddenly died on the way. As for the fact that the father mistook the brother at Liyuan, it cannot be verified.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Japanese Swords</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The Japanese respect martial arts and like to kill. They often wear Japanese swords as ornaments. There are two types, large and small. The large ones are called "Tachi," and the small ones are called "Wakizashi." During the Zhao Song Dynasty, the Japanese once paid tribute with them. Ouyang Yongshu had a "Song of the Japanese Sword," which was widely recited. According to Japanese historical records, the art of making swords began in the Heian period (during the Tang Dynasty in China). By the Chengging era (during the Five Dynasties period), its production began to be refined. During the reign of Emperor Uda (during the Yuan Dynasty in China), two craftsmen, Yoshimitsu and Masamune, were especially famous. They were no less than Gan Jiang and Mo Xie, who made swords in our country. Now, these swords are rare. The imperial family often uses them as gifts. I still remember that the Japanese Emperor gave Chiang Kai-shek a Japanese sword a few years ago. I don't know if this sword still exists. I sincerely hope that he will swear an oath and go straight to the barbarian island. Then, with this sword, he will quickly annihilate the barbarians.</p>
<p>Therefore, the literary scholar Bi Jian'an's Guangxu Palace Poem, one of several poems, says: "The Qiong flute and silver pipes sing the golden elixir, the wonderful dance and clear song move the holy face. Alas, the Japanese sword leaves a matter of regret, the cherry blossoms are withered and fallen to the human world.” The postscript says that Zhang Jian's "Tsui Yu Tang Poetry Talks" says: Emperor Dezong greatly appreciated the actor Yu Zhuang'er and performed a new play "Ten Golden Elixirs" in the palace. Before he could remove his makeup, Emperor Dezong summoned him to the palace and took his hand and looked back and said, "This son can be called both talented and virtuous." The Empress, because he was near the throne, was about to complain to the Empress Dowager Cixi. The Emperor was afraid and used the Japanese sword that Yu was wearing as a real weapon. He was about to be charged with the crime of carrying a weapon in front of the Emperor. He waved him out and said, "Send him to the Ministry of Justice." Yu then reported his illness and was never summoned again. There is a poem about this matter: "Zheng Yingtao danced and sang in front of the palace, the ten golden elixirs were unusually high-pitched. After all, the sage was holding the big picture, and the Japanese sword was taken off under the carved balustrade." This palace story involves Japanese swords, making it even more charming.</p>
<p>The Japanese Bushido actually began with Minamoto Yoritomo. Fearing that the last members of the Taira clan would fall into Judo and be weak, he advocated martial arts and practiced various martial arts. He became famous and well known. Until today, the imperial family still has Bushido to defend themselves. They hold a competition once a year. The winner will be rewarded with gold. They can become rich. The Bushido mostly excel in internal skills. If you wrestle with them, you cannot restrain their arms. Otherwise, after the luck has gone, the hands cannot be removed, or the nails will come off and the fingers will be reversed, and the extreme pain will make you fall down. Using Japanese swords is the ultimate skill of Bushido. When a certain celebrity traveled to Japan, his bamboo branch words had the line "Relying on Japanese swords to awaken the national soul," which is a factual record.</p>
<h3>Record of Things Seen and Heard in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>Strange Clock</p>
<p>"Notes on the West Qinghua" says, "The Great Bell of Jiaotai Hall in the palace is considered the standard. The hall has three rooms. The east room is equipped with a clepsydra, almost full. It uses about a bucket of water a day. Since the Qianlong era, it has long been abandoned. The west room is where the Great Bell is located. It is as tall as the room. Climbing up the ladder, the key is turned and the spring is wound up. It is only opened again a month later. There has been no difference for decades. The sound travels far, reaching outside the Qianqing Gate. It is still the old system from the Wanli period." It also says, "There is a clock in the Neifu. The lower frame has a copper man. He is about four or five inches long. He is kneeling with one foot bent. In front of him is a sand tray. When the clock rings, the copper man holds a tube in one hand and draws sand in the tray to make the four characters 'Tian Xia Tai Ping' (world peace). When the sound of the clock disappears, the writing is also finished. It is said that it was also made when the Italian priest came to China for the first time.”</p>
<p>In the past, when I read this record, I always thought it was absurd. Now that the Forbidden City is open, the treasures of the inner government's celestial sphere are all revealed. I realized that Shen Shi was actually speaking based on what he saw. Jiaotai Hall was originally the place where the imperial seals were stored. It was rarely visited on weekdays. Therefore, there was enough space in the hall to store the Great Bell. Among the clocks in the country, the largest and most ancient one is probably unparalleled. The old clocks and watches stored in the Wuying Hall of the Ancient Cultural Relics Exhibition are even more numerous. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, old craftsmen were hired to repair the machines one by one for display. They were all worth seeing. One of them had a box door that opened automatically every time the clock rang. Crystal sand flowed, making a rustling sound, like a waterfall. Then, birds sang on the branches, their songs were melodious and pleasing to the ear. They fluttered their wings and flew to other branches, and then they lingered for a long time before stopping. Its workmanship is hardly human. There are also similar legends from the past. It is said that a certain governor of Guangdong during the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods sought a craftsman to make a machine that would write the four characters "Wan Shou Wu Jiang" (long live the emperor). He planned to present it to the palace. Because he was stingy with his expenses, he was questioned by the eunuch. He said that if the machine suddenly broke when writing the word "Wu," the disaster would be unpredictable. The governor was afraid and stopped. At that time, the craftsmen's attention was so focused on playthings. It is no wonder that the elders strongly criticized the strange and ingenious skills of Westerners.</p>
<p>In the year of Jia Shen in the Qianlong period, a certain country in the West presented eighteen copper puppets who could perform an entire play of the West Chamber. The puppets were about a foot tall. Their bodies, ears, eyes, hands, and feet were all cast in copper. Their hearts and intestines were all connected by keys. Like an automatic clock, each scene had a fixed process of inserting the key and opening the lock. If it was opened incorrectly, they would sit, lie down, walk, and speak incorrectly. Zhang Ying, Hong Niang, Hui Ming, Fa Cong, and others could put on clothes from the box. Their body movements, gestures, salutes, advances, and retreats were all lifelike. They just couldn't sing. After a scene was over, they would take off their clothes and lie in the box. When it was their turn, they would stand up again. In the middle of the scene, they would stand up on the carpet. This is what a certain notebook recorded. There is no such thing in the Forbidden City today. The clocks and watches in the Forbidden City are mostly products from 17th-century England. They have the manufacturer's mark. They are not only known for their gorgeous decorations and harmonious sounds. Their precision has lasted for a long time without any error. There is nothing like this today. In addition, the collections of old families and noble clans are also quite numerous. Many of the smaller ones have fallen into the hands of merchants. The heavier ones that cannot be obtained are still there. I think that those who have a fondness for this can compile a "Chronicle of Clocks in the Old Capital," which will surely be widely circulated. The people of the capital also call watches "clocks," which is also a tradition from ancient times.</p>
<h3>The Story of Ma Shuanglou (12)</h3>
<p>— Seeking Happiness Studio Owner</p>
<p>Episode 2: Mocking Good Teachers, Spreading Bad News, Home Encountering Robbery, Pitying Intimate Friends, Comforting Sad Feelings, Spring Awakening in the Inn</p>
<p>Wei Zhuomou ran into a wall. He paused slightly, but then regained his composure. Like an actor reciting lines in a play, he asked in a strange voice, "Hey, I see you have something very heavy on your mind today. Since I have nothing to do, let me guess." Then he scratched his head and cheeks and did another set of delicate acting. Only then did he say, "Oh, oh, oh, I guessed it. Let me ask you first, has An Yutian come these past two days? You're probably missing him, right?" Liang Xiaoyun turned her face away and said, "You're guessing wildly again. Why would I miss him for no reason? It's just that he hasn't come these past few days. Let's talk about serious matters. Have you seen him? Do you know why he hasn't been out for several days?" Wei Zhuomou smiled and said, "How can you be sure that he hasn't been out for several days? Just because he hasn't come to you, does that mean he can't go anywhere else?" This counter-question left her speechless and a little ashamed, causing a slight flush to rise on her powdery cheeks. She became even more coquettish and said, "I don't care about you. You're too hateful. I was just asking you about him seriously. Why are you always going against me? I'm not talking to you anymore. Please leave." Wei Zhuomou smiled and said, "I can't leave. I know the most details about his affairs. I came here today because even if you didn't ask me, I was originally going to tell you about it after class. Now that you've angered me, I can't just tell you the details casually. Let me just reveal a little bit. He's gotten into big trouble. This trouble is very big. It's not only terrible, but also unbearable. If you want to know what happens next, listen to the next episode. Since you're not happy talking to me, I don't need to say any more. Excuse me, I'll ask for leave. I'm leaving. You don't need to make a fuss." After saying that, he picked up a book and really stood up, pretending to take a step to leave. She hurriedly grabbed his hand and stamped her feet and said, "Okay, you playful Mr. Don't pretend anymore. Hurry up and tell me. What big trouble did he get into? Is it serious? Tell me quickly." Wei Zhuomou said he was leaving, but he was just playing around. Naturally, he stabilized his body and said slowly, "Seeing how anxious you are, it's obvious that you really care about him. If I tell you the truth about his unfortunate disaster, I'm a little afraid that you won't be able to bear it. But you're asking me so hard, how can I not tell you? There's no other way. Please calm your mind and be brave enough to listen." Liang Xiaoyun suddenly interjected, "You're saying it's so scary. I remember he said he had a headache when he came here last time. Could it be that he's really fallen ill?" Wei Zhuomou hurriedly waved his hand and said, "No, that's not it. Don't interrupt. He's very strong. He can't be knocked down by your illness. Why are you being so anxious? This time his disaster is more serious than anything else. I'm from the same hometown as him. I know all about his family's affairs. He has elderly parents in the hall, and also a weak younger brother. He alone … Yu family is in the hometown…</p>

<h3>Renewed Rise in Gold Standard Speculation</h3>
<p>▲ Added Swap Rose Approximately Thirteen Taels</p>
<p>▲ The swap was offered by the shorts. Yesterday, the downward trend of the gold standard subsided, and the situation looked sharp. Although there were ups and downs, the sharp rise slightly receded. Due to the swap date, business started as early as 8:30 in the morning. However, brokers were already trading outside the market before 8 o'clock. The February to March swap was still offered by the shorts, initially at four taels and several cents to four taels and seventy-eight cents. When the market officially opened, it was calculated at three taels and ninety cents. Later, as large clients were willing to swap out, it gradually became smaller, eventually only costing one tael and seven cents. All February contracts were no longer traded and were changed to March contracts. The opening price was 673 taels and 4 qian, and the closing price was 80 and a half taels, a rebound of 13 taels and 2 qian from the previous day, reversing the multi-day decline. This was a shift based on the March listing for swaps.</p>
<p>▲ March Already on the Market Yesterday. Buyers of March contracts were excited, and the price had already exceeded 670 taels in the morning, due to the reported decline in the silver market. Subsequently, swap prices became cheap, and sellers were active. There were also reports from foreign news agencies that supporting unemployed workers might lead to a rise in silver prices, causing a slight setback. However, the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar continued to rise, tightening the British gold situation in Shanghai. Furthermore, the US dollar was secretly strong, and the forward rate shrank from 33.75 yuan to 1.25, with British gold also breaking into 11 pence. Demand exceeded supply in the market, and the price exceeded 680 taels. In the afternoon, due to Saturday, there was no market, and the week's complex situation was reviewed. It initially saw a high rise, once rising to 700 taels. Due to the current situation, it then broke into 670 taels, before returning to a moderate state. The whole week saw a difference of 34 to 35 taels. Looking back, the February contract fell by 13 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Buying Enthusiasm Pushed Prices Above Eighty Taels. Yesterday morning, the opening price of March contracts was 669 and a half taels. Large bars of silver fell by five-sixteenths, and forward silver fell by one-quarter. Both public and private telegrams reported a fall in silver prices by one-eighth. There were always more buyers from various firms. This then increased to 71 taels and 7 qian. However, it was learned that large bars were being settled, and the United States was selling and then buying again. Furthermore, due to downstream swaps, firms such as Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Da Xing Yong, and Yi Feng came to sell, and the price declined to 66 taels and 2 qian at just after 9:10. Additionally, banks such as the British Gold, Sino-Japanese, etc., were selling, such as 11 pence and 125 for March and April, and 75 for the US dollar. Until the British gold announcement reduced to 125, and the US dollar slightly increased to 125, the price then increased to 69 taels and 3 qian. The internal trend was favorable, with Mitsui absorbing 33.625 for April, and absorbing 125 for British gold. The market trend was good, and Fu Yu, Yuan Da Yong, Da De Cheng, Tong Tai Chang, etc., all stepped in to buy, and the price quickly exceeded 70 taels. After 10:15, the situation became even more vibrant, with the Cantonese banks settling short positions in British gold at 0625, and US dollars settling at only 375. After 10:30, it was 76 taels and 2 qian, with only a little over one tael of retracement. Afterwards, Fu Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, and hedgers sold, and the price dropped by three taels, to 73 taels at 11:15. However, bills of exchange were still strong, so it rose again. It was calculated that Mitsui and Zhengjin sold US dollars for April at 1875, and Sumitomo sold British gold at 11 pence to 10 pence 9375. In addition, Da Xing Yong, Da De Cheng, Yuan Da Yong, Hong Kang Yong Fu Tai Heng, Yuan Tai, Qian Chang Xiang, etc., were constantly pushing in, and the price rose even higher, jumping to 78 taels. At 11:50, it reached 81 taels. At this time, Sino-French sold US dollars for April at 1875 to HSBC. In an instant, it fell slightly by more than two taels, as sellers seemed diligent, and retail investors who had long positions took profits and sold off, so it retreated to 78 and a half taels. By the closing price of 78 taels and 8 qian, it continued to trade around 9 taels, a gain of approximately 13 taels compared to the previous day (with swaps). According to the statistics, the maximum fluctuation in half a day was 14 taels and 8 qian, with a maximum of 81 taels and a minimum of 66 taels and 2 qian. The opening price for goods was 69 taels and 3 qian, and the closing price was 79 taels. The listed price was changed to 724 and a half taels, with a difference of 55-56 taels to 44-45 taels. The registered prices were 81 taels for January-February, 79 taels for March, 81 taels for water replenishment, and a premium of 9 and a half taels for red bars. Transactions were scattered.</p>
<p>▲ Extremely Busy Market Trading. Trading on the trading floor was still active. Firms such as Tong Tai Chang, Xie Xing Yong, Da Xing Yong, Hong Kang Yong, Tong Chun, Yuan Mao, Ri Chang, Wan Xing, Da De Cheng, Yuan Da Yong, Yuan Tai, and Fu Tai Heng all bought in. Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Yu, and Yi Feng all sold out. Heng Xing sold 2100 bars and bought in 1200 bars. Qian Chang Xiang, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Heng, Heng Yu, Shun Li, Da Kang, Yi Feng Yong, Yuan Chun, and Tai Feng Cheng were very active in handling transactions. Speculators frequently entered and exited, arbitraging bills of exchange and swapping out bars. The Dalian banks traded a total of 1200-1300 bars, breaking even. The Cantonese banks sold over 1000 bars and bought in over 200 bars.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: Both British and American Currencies Strong</h3>
<p>▲ Foreign Firms Settled Accounts… Gold Market Transactions Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, British and American silver markets both rebounded, with the market soft but resilient. Exchange rates continued to rise. The British pound to the US dollar was calculated at $3.485, and the US dollar to the British pound was $3.48375. HSBC's listed price for British gold shrank by half a grade (125), calculated as 1 shilling and 10 and 875 pence. The US dollar conversely lengthened by 125, calculated at 33.125 yuan. Hong Kong added 125, calculated at 75.875 taels. Other currencies, such as German marks, did not change, while Japanese marks increased by 1.5 yuan. Indian, French, and Singaporean currencies all tightened. In practice, banks were trading at tighter prices. Although exchange rates were large, British gold should tighten, and the US dollar was also profitable. As a result, compared to the previous day, British gold shrank by 375, and the US dollar shrank by 625. Indeed, foreign firms such as British American Tobacco Company had all settled accounts. Therefore, there was a sharp rise in gold prices, and gold market transactions were very active. The volume of British gold traded was 100,000 pounds, with some arbitraging. The volume of US dollars was approximately 700,000-800,000 yuan, mostly purchases, with some hedging. Additionally, Guang Bang Sheng Da offset previous short positions, as that firm was settling. In the afternoon, due to Saturday, the market was closed as usual.</p>
<p>▲ British Exchange: There were twenty-five differences in the domestic market in half a day. The tightest forward rate was 1 shilling, 10 pence, 875. The loosest price was 11 pence, 125. The asking price in the morning was 1875 to 125, and the selling price was 25 to 1875. Mitsui sold 125 for March. Zhejiang, Mitsui Shanghai sold 125 for April. Mitsui bought 125 for March.

The recent trend still seems loose.</p>
<p>▲ US Exchange: There was a fluctuation of 625 in the domestic market between morning and noon. The tightest forward rate was 33.125 yuan, and the loosest price was 33.75 yuan. In the morning, the asking price was 625, and the buying price was 75. Sumitomo and American Express traded 75 for April. Mitsui and Sumitomo sold 75 for March and April.

Recently, the spot price shrank by 3125, to 19 pence 625, and the forward price also fell by 25, calculated at 19 pence 75. Domestic settlements in China advanced and then retreated. The United States slightly sold off, but there was a lack of support. After the market closed, the market was stable, and the United States tended to buy. A telegram was also received from New York that the price of American silver also fell by 125, with the spot price calculated at 3 angular 025. The British pound to the US dollar rose by 1/125, to 3.485 yuan. The US dollar to the British pound increased by 1/625, calculated at 3.48375 yuan. The British pound to Shanghai shilling shortened by 125, calculated at 1 shilling and 11 pence 625. Mumbai was closed.</p>

<h3>Rumors of a Short Squeeze in This Month's Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and rose in the afternoon, and the situation turned tight. Due to the large number of transactions in the current month, the account balances of Rong Xing and Yi Chang were over 12,000 bales. It was expected that there would be a shortage of deliveries, and there were rumors of a short squeeze in the market, and market sentiment turned firm. Distant months were also pulled up by it, but based on the facts, there was no great upward force. With the country in such a state and the financial situation so dire, the securities turmoil had not yet subsided. However, recent spot demand was good, and yarn stocks in warehouses were low, which was also a major reason for the rise.</p>
<p>▲ Standard Yarn Good: 7, 8, 9 Qian. Before the public bidding, the American cotton market was stable, and the situation was flat. Each month rose slightly by 1 or 2 qian. In the afternoon, the market sentiment for the current month suddenly tightened, and sellers were short and rose by 8 qian. Distant months rose by 4, 5, 6, 7 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 12,700 bales. It was found that Sen Kang sold 1,100 bales, Yi Chang sold 550 bales, Rong Xing sold 600 bales, and Shen Chang sold 400 bales.

The transaction volume among peers was 1,150 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton: In a Stable State</h3>
<p>The cotton market turned firm. As the trend of American cotton stabilized and Indian cotton was difficult to obtain, people's hearts were firmer. However, sellers were still bearish due to the low price of American cotton. Although there were many deliveries this month, there were also many buyers. Therefore, the overall situation was still one of consolidation.</p>
<p>▲ Han Standard Rose by 2 Qian. The Han Standard market opened with American cotton being flat. Each month rose slightly by 5 fen to 1 qian. In the afternoon, the market sentiment suddenly increased, and each month rose by 1-2 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 22,500 dan.

<p>▲ Cotton Demand Flat. The transaction of spot cotton was flat. Yuan Ji Tong Hua sold 300 bales.</p>
<p>Egyptian Cotton: 38.50. Pu Yi Factory sent 100 pieces to the factory.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Stable, British Cotton Weakened</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to foreign merchant purchases, but then weakened due to the slump on Wall Street, and finally firmed again due to short covering. The futures price rose by 1-3 points, and the spot price was unchanged. British cotton futures fell by 4 points, and the spot price fell by 7 points. The spot price of Egyptian cotton fell by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 15th):</p>
<p>American Cotton Compared to the Previous Day (Converted to Shanghai Standard) British Cotton Compared to the Previous Day (Converted to Shanghai Standard)</p>

<h3>Last Week, American Cotton Was Still Considered Firm</h3>
<p>▲ Domestic and Foreign Demand Gradually Increased… Southern Hedging Weak</p>
<p>▲ But the Focus of the Market Was on Economic Recovery</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 15th reported on the cotton market for the week. Domestic and foreign demand gradually increased, and the support of brokers was also stronger. At the same time, there was progress in legislation in Washington, so there was more room for expansion. When prices rose, long positions were slightly closed, but Southern sales were very thin, so the base remained firm. At the beginning of the week, the news that Germany would not repay its debts caused considerable panic, but later, Europe resumed buying, and the Bremen market was also firm, which was the reason for the market's recovery. The improvement in piece goods transactions also boosted morale. However, the development of actual demand was often limited by abundant supply. Cooperatives Executive Director Cremo estimated that the reduction in cotton fields would be at most 10% to 15%. However, the current focus of the market was on economic recovery, which was more important than the new cotton situation.</p>

<h3>Rice Market: Small Arrivals, Active Sales</h3>
<p>▲ At the Shanghai South City God Temple and Cuixiu Hall Public Association Yesterday, the standards for sea dou were compared in the period market. There were about 30-odd sources from the West Road. There were slight transactions on this street. Changshu and Xibei Japonica and Sutong assistance increased by nearly one jiao. Thin rice and early rice also followed and increased by one jiao and a half. No one cared about Pingli white Japonica, and there was a downward trend. The sources of foreign Du Jian were very scarce, and customer assistance was the best, so the trend became hard.</p>
<p>▲ At Xinzha Morning, those near the market were still enthusiastic. Buyers were not smooth. The thick Japonica countryside assistance handled nearly a thousand stones, and the price was raised by one or two jiao. Early thin rice and Port Du Jian felt even tighter. In fact, there were still many arrivals on the inner road, and due to the financial situation, people's hearts turned hard. The general trend was that arrivals and sales were balanced. There were no ups and downs in the market. Rare and light sales of customer goods were neither prosperous nor declining.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Has Zhendong Banks Pilot</h3>
<p>▲ Price Increased by One Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation: spot sales on this street were still good, but the North and Han banks stopped. However, Zhendong Banks piloted 1,000 bags of small twisted rice, and the price increased by one jiao, to 9 yuan and 7 jiao. This street handled 500 bags of imported small twisted rice, at a price of 9 yuan and 4 jiao and a half. 2,000 bags of Saigon Number One, at a price of 11 yuan and 1 jiao and a half and 5 taels and 3 qian and a half, were sold by foreign firms and this street. There were not many transactions in glutinous rice, and the market slightly turned firmer.</p>
<h3>Forward Flour: Loose in the Morning, Recovered in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>▲ Rumor: Australian Foreign Wheat Factories Have Made a Deal Again</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market: After the market opened in the morning, the market for each month was unstable again. Because on the factory side, it was heard that Australian foreign wheat had been dealt again, and the combined price was only 3 taels and 6 qian. The exchange's dumping of goods naturally turned smooth. With the exchange rate loosening, Japanese merchants were also seen soliciting business. If this statement was true, it was not a blessing for the future. As a result, it was a little less than one fen to one fen and a half compared to the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the current month was still consolidating. The distant months were slightly absorbed by the inner banks due to the factory dumping slackening, and the market sentiment was relatively firm. As a result, the current month was better than the previous day by two li and a half, February was unchanged, March was slightly less by five li, April was slightly less by two li and a half, May was slightly less by seven li and a half, and June was slightly less by one fen and two li and a half.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the morning and afternoon wheat market, each month generally showed a consolidation trend. As foreign wheat quotations were only good for about two jiao, all parties were buying and selling very little due to the year-end closing. Although it was rumored that factories would continue to order foreign wheat, dumping was not smooth, and the market was able to stand firm. However, with the poor environment, it would eventually be difficult to rise. As a result, each month from the current month to May was slightly less by one fen, and June was slightly less by two fen.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Coarse White Granulated Sugar Suddenly Rose Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market sent a telegram from the producing areas. The current price of Cuban sugar was still 1.5625, and the price of New York sugar futures was 1.07 for March and 1.08 for May. There was no increase or decrease compared to the previous telegram. The price was 1.19 for September and 1.24 for December, down by one cent. There were also no fluctuations in the current and forward prices of Java sugar. The Shanghai Public Association Market's planned plate, with the Dutch exchange rate shrinking and people's hearts turning better, buying sentiment suddenly turned active, but sellers were very lacking and the asking price was quite high. The initial transaction price was 9 taels and 6 qian. Nan Shenglong sold 500 bags, and there were also sporadic transactions, but buyers did not slacken, and the price rose to 9 taels and 6 qian and a half. Sellers were still lacking, and the trend was quite firm. In the subsequent market, the asking price rose to 9 taels and 7 qian. The asking price for medium white granulated sugar also rose, but there were few transactions. The price of Taikoo Sugar B Mark was 11 taels and 9 qian, and the price of HM Mark was 11 taels and 4 qian. Although there were slight transactions, the market was stable and not surprising.</p>
<p>North and South Goods</p>
<h3>Orchid Rice: Tianjin Price Turned Upward</h3>
<p>Orchid rice is a necessary item in spices. The Shanghai market had been quiet in sales from all sides, and the listed price had fallen by three or four taels. Recently, it was heard that the demand in Tianjin had increased. According to the letter, the high-quality goods had risen to 40 taels. Although the trend here was tired, it did not mean that it would not bring luck. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship arrived from Xiamen with another batch. If it was a high-quality commodity, there was hope for a rebound in the listed price.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>White Factory Telegram Still Not Turning</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign firm silk market in Shanghai still found it difficult to make progress. The American market silk sales were still stagnant, and the white factory telegram had not yet turned. Although the European firms' appetite was strong, the factory was selling at a loss and found it difficult to sell. Yesterday, only Yongxing bought one package of yellow silk, and Zhonghe and others bought ten packages of white silk. The price was still flat and tired.</p>
<h3>London Weaving and Spinning: Sales Stagnant, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>▲ Exchange Rate Increased and Each Pound Fell Two or Three Pence</p>
<p>In the London market, recently, due to the intense political struggle in British India, the sales of yarn-woven products were sluggish. The silk factories' purchase remained slack. In addition, with the exchange market, the price of weaving and spinning fell. The top-grade dry silk was only ten shillings and four pence per pound, the middle-grade was ten shillings, and the low-grade was nine shillings and five pence, each falling by two or three pence.</p>
<h3>Special Treasures Tea Transactions Prosperous</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the tea market of foreign firms in Shanghai, Xiehe Foreign Firm, in view of the reasonable tea prices, conducted a large-scale search for special treasure teas from Wuyuan and Tunxi. Baochang and Tianyu and other firms also had scattered purchases, and transactions were prosperous. However, the selling opening price had shrunk to 123-124 taels, a drop of hundreds of taels compared to the previous price. Chinese tea merchants suffered significant losses. As for other green teas such as needle eyebrows and tribute treasures, and low-grade treasure eyebrows, there were no transactions in the whole market.</p>
<h3>Hardware: British White Iron Sales Were Active</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions: Recently, due to the urgency of the year-end, market transactions were scarce. However, sales of British white iron were unusually active yesterday, so there were as many as 500 to 600 dan. The quoted price was 1 tael and 1 qian and a half for 7 feet, and 9 qian and 5 fen for 6 feet. However, investigations found that the Yangtze River banks had been very strong in recent transactions, so the market outlook was still very optimistic.</p>
<h3>Ribbed Steel Fell Back 2.5 Taels</h3>
<p>The stock of ribbed steel bars has been thick recently, with little transaction, and the market is depressed. The standard has a feeling of going downhill. It is currently selling for 75 taels, which is 2.5 taels less than before. The market transaction is only that construction gangs, who need it for practical use, have added some, otherwise, there is almost no business.</p>

<h3>The Resurrection of Japanese Ships and the Unfortunate Exclusion of Chinese Employees</h3>
<p>According to this newspaper's report on the 14th, almost all Japanese ships in China have ceased operations and stopped classes due to the boycott since the September 18 Incident. On the Yangtze River route, the original number of Japanese ships, more than 20, has been reduced to three, all of which are air-borne. On the Sino-Japanese route of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company, there are four routes and nine ships in operation. The business is excellent, and the monthly income from passenger tickets alone is 90,000 to 100,000 yuan. In October and November of last year, the monthly income was only 12,000 to 13,000 yuan, a drop of eight-tenths compared to normal. However, recently, my country's anti-Japanese goods movement has been relaxed, and Japanese ships on the Yangtze River have taken the opportunity to reduce fares by 50%. As a result, exports have suddenly surged, and the three special cabins on each trip are all crowded. On the Sino-Japanese route, business income has also suddenly increased, increasing from more than 10,000 yuan last month to about 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>According to this newspaper's report on the 15th, the Japanese merchant ships in Dalian Bay have already held a meeting and decided that from this month onwards, all Chinese sailors, stokers, etc. used by each ship will be suspended, and the number of unemployed people will be at least 1,000 or more. In addition, there is an even more bizarre piece of news: Zhang Zhengben, the president of my country's Zhengji Shipping Company, suddenly disregarded everything and replaced all the senior crew members of all 23 ships with Japanese, and submitted a request to the Ministry of Transportation, saying that there was a lack of talent among Chinese sailors and that Japanese had to be used. He requested that Japanese be issued shipowner licenses.</p>
<p>After we have read the above two news items, we really want to cry without tears. The lost territory of the Northeast has not yet been recovered, and Jinzhou has recently fallen again. The enemy cavalry is roaring and coming west, and the public spirit that we once agitated and encouraged has returned to a state of sleep. The eighth boycott of Japanese goods is about to end. On the contrary, the Japanese are completely dismissing the Chinese crew members on my country's ships. Who is boycotting whom? Who is the ultimate victor? The Japanese ridiculed our anti-Japanese goods movement as a "childhood disease" and said, "After one boycott, the sales of Japanese goods will inevitably surge." We have really been seen through. O nation that does not strive, what will you use to survive when the last weapon you have in your hand is taken away by the enemy?</p>
<p>As for the manager of Zhengji Shipping Company willingly recognizing the thief as his father, his heart is completely dead, so what more can be said? Even if he were to be hacked to pieces, it would not be enough to cover up his guilt.</p>
<p>Compatriots, for the sake of self-salvation and national salvation, can we bear to give up the last remaining weapon of self-defense in our hands?</p>

<h3>Gambling with Destiny</h3>
<p>— Zhou Wu'ai</p>
<p>A bright red large X is squarely pasted on the greasy lamppost. Annoying, ear-splitting gongs and suonas play unnatural tunes from the hands or mouths of several children, reflecting in the doorway that the value of a young woman's life is being gambled away in a game of fate.</p>
<p>The master of ceremonies, wearing a jade-green jacket over a torn cotton robe, chants practiced eulogies that have nothing to do with him from his yellow face, tightly wrapped around bones, and between his teeth stained with grime. Relatives and friends filled the room, and idle onlookers from the neighborhood crowded the courtyard, all quietly holding their breath. Only the master of ceremonies constantly spews out his authority, directing a busy group of men and women and the newlywed bride, adorned with powder and pearls. The bride, under a pair of brightly lit, flickering red candles,</p>
<p>is a nineteen-year-old miss. Her petite figure, adorned with such gorgeous attire, walks gracefully and stands elegantly, further enhancing her inherent beauty with artificial adornment. The silent ones all stirred. The eyes of parents and sisters seemed somewhat reddened. Idle onlookers discussed irrelevant criticisms.</p>
<p>Twisting her slender waist, following the master of ceremonies' direction, she bows and bids farewell incessantly. The emotions of parting make those involved feel lonely. Sadness covers the smiling face that dominates everything, leading her mother to gamble on hope, unable to hold back tears of mixed emotions. A lonely atmosphere occupies several moved hearts amidst the lively scene.</p>
<p>In turn, she approached me. Her lowered face occasionally lifted. Before I could discern the external expression of her inner self, she lowered it again with the repeated words "bow." As I returned the bow, my heart and mind were surging with chaotic memories and fantasies.</p>
<p>She entered the flower sedan chair, its curtain already lifted – a flower sedan chair decorated so that she could not breathe fresh air or see a ray of light. As the curtain was drawn, eight coarse and repulsive porters hoisted her up on their shoulders. Amid shouts and the blare of music, she hid in the darkness, waiting quietly for the gamble of fate to bet on the value of her life!</p>
<p>Smiling in dreams of love, she never walked through a rosy garden, only entrusting her color-blind ideals to the flower sedan chair, waiting for the mystical world to be revealed when the sedan curtain is raised again.</p>

<h3>Resurrecting from Ashes</h3>
<p>— Tao Xiaotao</p>
<p>"Resurrecting from Ashes" is a trick of nurturing air. It can make an extinguished fire reignite. Since we want to experiment with this trick of nurturing air, we should also know a little about the history of nurturing air.</p>
<p>Tradition has it that nurturing air was discovered by the Englishman Joseph Priestley. In 1774, he obtained this gas by heating red mercuric oxide (i.e., elixir). However, before Priestley, a Swedish chemist named Scheele was actually the first to discover nurturing air.</p>
<p>Scheele used manganese dioxide to invent nurturing air. We can do it once, too. Take a test tube, wipe it dry with a cloth on all sides to prevent it from bursting when heated. Put a spoonful each of manganese dioxide and potassium chlorate into the test tube. Seal the mouth of the tube with a cork. Drill a hole in the middle of the cork, the size of a glass tube, and insert a bent glass tube. Next, take a washbasin (or glass tank) and fill it with a little more than half a basin of water.</p>
<p>Then take a glass, fill it with water, and place it upside down in the water in the washbasin. Next, put the end of the bent glass tube outside the test tube into the bottom of the glass. Then light an alcohol lamp and burn the manganese dioxide in the test tube. The potassium chlorate will react chemically and emit a gas. You will see bubbles emerging in the glass. These bubbles are oxygen bubbles, running one by one into the glass. The water in the glass is gradually pushed down by the nurturing air.</p>
<p>When all the water in the cup is pushed out, use a wire to tie a match, light the match, blow it out, and quickly put the red-hot match head into the cup. You will see the match burn again, even redder than before it was lit, burning until the match is gone.</p>
<p>This experiment proves that nurturing air has the property of helping combustion. You must do this experiment quickly to get good results. This experiment can be done successfully for only two or three dimes.</p>
<p>This nurturing air is the same as the nurturing air in the air. Air contains two-tenths nurturing air. Fire can burn in the air because of nurturing air.</p>

<h3>Various Ways of Making a Living (4) Apricots</h3>
<p>Do readers have some spare time? If you have some spare time, you might as well act as a temporary "road inspector" and inspect for a week. You can discover the livelihood of many poor and good people.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "If a person has no means of livelihood, they will eat up a peck of gold." Moreover, those poor and good common people not only have no peck of gold to sit and eat, but also have no copper tendons and iron bones to work as coolies. They are also unwilling to do evil. In the sinful Shanghai, it is difficult for them not to cheat, steal, plunder, or rob. They rely on their ten fingers to feed their mouths. These good people are also worth talking about.</p>
<p>One day, I saw a compatriot with a sallow face on North Sichuan Road Bridge, standing under the high wall of the post office, basking in the sun, holding a fir box filled with bamboo ear picks and head-scratching and head-washing bamboo utensils. He was sharpening a small bamboo stick in his hand. An ear pick is worth two copper coins, and a head-washing bamboo comb is worth four to six copper coins. Curiosity made me start asking him:</p>
<p>"Is your business good?"</p>
<p>He glanced at me strangely and did not answer. However, I, who "break the casserole and ask to the end," still asked the second sentence:</p>
<p>"How much copper money can you sell in a day?"</p>
<p>"If it's good, I can sell a few dimes, if it's not good, only a few copper plates." He said calmly.</p>
<p>"Are a few dimes enough to eat?"</p>
<p>"If it's not enough, what can I do! Those who have copper money use money to make money, those who kidnap use their lives to make money. People in my business eat when they have food, and starve when they don't."</p>
<p>These words were sincere, but I felt that he was teaching me a lesson.</p>

<h3>Wen Qing in a Pavilion for Five Yuan a Day</h3>
<p>My classmate and good friend, Miss Zhou, dropped out of school due to the tragic changes in her family and the oppression of her environment. She left Shanghai and wandered elsewhere to seek a livelihood for almost two years. Now she has returned to Shanghai to find a school to continue her studies. She</p>
<p>found a pavilion in an alley she used to live in, as a temporary place to settle down.</p>
<p>She had just moved her luggage into the building when the landlady urged her to pay five yuan in rent. She tidied up her luggage and turned on the electric lights in the house. She was quietly sitting on the edge of the bed, resting, when the landlady came in again.</p>
<p>"Miss, please go out and find a guarantor!" the landlady said.</p>
<p>"Find what guarantor?" She stared at the landlady in surprise and said.</p>
<p>"Now, to live in a house in the Chinese Concession, you need to have a guarantor. If you don't find a guarantor to file a guarantee at the police station today, they will come and check, and you will definitely be punished." The landlady said again.</p>
<p>"I am a student, and I will not live here for long. I will move to the school. I don't know anyone in Shanghai. Where can I find a guarantor! Well, if you need a guarantor, please be my guarantor." She said again.</p>
<p>"Originally, for people doing other businesses, the sub-landlord can go to the police station to file a guarantee. Because you are a student, there are many unruly people among the students, so the police station must have a shop guarantee." The landlady said.</p>
<p>"Students are not floods or wild beasts. It's really annoying. There is no freedom to live in Shanghai!" She said in surprise again.</p>
<p>At this time, it was really difficult for her to find a shop guarantee. If she didn't find a shop guarantee, the police station would punish her again. There was no way but to think about moving back to the hotel. So she negotiated with the landlady to return the rent. But when the landlady heard that she wanted to return the five yuan rent, her face immediately changed and she said:</p>
<p>"There is no rule in Shanghai that rent can be returned after it has been paid." She argued with the landlady for a long time, but there was no result. Miss Zhou was so angry that her face turned red. On one hand, she hated the woman's cunning and deceit, and on the other hand, she hated the ruling authorities for not having a fundamental way to maintain social order, causing some pedestrians and travelers to be in a dilemma.</p>
<p>It was late at night, and she risked spending the night in the pavilion. The next morning, she packed her luggage again, called a rickshaw, and went straight to the hotel she had stayed in before.</p>
<h3>Small Consumption Statistics</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuilin</p>
<p>X Opium and Gambling</p>
<p>Last year, the French envoy ordered the French Concession to ban opium and gambling. It was reported that about 50,000 people in the French Concession rely on opium and gambling for a living. If it is banned, public security cannot be maintained. By analogy, in the combined concessions of the North and South Municipalities, no less than 200,000 people rely on opium and gambling. These people make profits and share profits every day, with direct and indirect living expenses of about 1.5 yuan.</p>

<p>X The Current Site of the British Consulate</p>
<p>British Consul Balfour was originally in Shanghai County. At this time, he was eager to purchase land within the concession to rebuild the new office. However, according to the laws of the British government at the time, foreign consuls were not allowed to purchase land and build public offices. They could only rent houses in the host country as the consulate. However, British Consul Balfour ignored his own country's laws and boldly sought land within the concession to build a consulate.</p>
<p>On April 28, 1846, Balfour purchased a piece of land from the Li family at the northern end of the British Concession, totaling one hundred acres, for a price of 17,000 yuan. Because he had not obtained the permission of the British government, Balfour advanced 4,000 yuan himself. After May, Balfour was discharged and Alcock (Rutherfkrd Alcock) succeeded as consul. After taking over the matter, after many difficulties, he finally obtained the approval of the British government to acknowledge the purchase price of the consulate. The new site of the British Consulate was finally determined. On July 21, 1849, the British Consul moved from the city to the new site in the concession.</p>
<p>The new consulate built in 1852 was destroyed by fire on December 23, 1870. Many documents were reduced to ashes. The current British Consulate was rebuilt in 1872.</p>
