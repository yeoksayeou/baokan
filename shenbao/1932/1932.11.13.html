<p>時評</p>
<h3>最近了版界之文字案敬</h3>
<p>任何宗敎。凡其經歷之時間。達千百年。其皈依之信徒。達千百萬。則必具有一種特殊精神。乃能感動多數之羣衆。久傳而不敝。故一敎之成立。其基礎之固。如山岳之屹立。决非一二人之力所能撼動。者第萬物萬情。趨舍不同入主出奴。人之恒情。故自奉之敎。備致尊崇。而對於他敎。輙無好評。在昔專制時代。菲薄宗敎。目爲大逆不道之行爲。甚至置其人於死地。秦西哲學之祖蘇格拉底。即因發揮眞理。有背敎旨。而遭殺身之禍。後人莫不痛惜之。但至近代。自由主義。日見發達。於是信仰得自由。言論得自由。雖高唱無神之論。亦莫或禁之。而宗敎亦由神秘性轉爲社會化。且成一種專學。供人研究研究。之餘。自不免論列其短長。彼不滿意於其所論列者。或亦著爲文章以駁之。或另著一書以攻其人所奉之宗敎。此種書籍。在歐美出版界中。頻頻見之。無所畏忌。蓋眞理愈辯而愈明。正如寳鏡愈磨而愈瑩也。然此僅爲極少數著作家之工作。至於普通信徒。對於宗敎之批評。咸恝然置之。恬不爲怪。誠以物之眞性。具於本體。非毀譽所能損益。此如日月之經天。雖偶爲浮雲所蔽。而固無損其光明也。且自近代新潮流磅　全宇之後。一切學術。咸有「新」的趨勢。於是各宗敎亦有革新之派。應運而生。新舊兩派。亦不免彼此相非。但咸以辯論眞理爲立塲故罕見發生任何衝突焉。</p>
<p>是以吾人對於各宗敎若出以學者莊重之態度。論列其短長。言之而成理。以供一般人士之探討。則爲言論自由之所許。若出以傖夫駡人之口吻。穢褻之文字。而使對方難堪以爲快。是爲侮辱宗敎。而當加以禁懲者也。此次南華文藝社與北新書局所刋布之文字。即屬此類。第此種文字。初視之。似覺嚴重細按之。正如行政院通令所謂事端殊微。何則。譬諸有人毀一金肆曰。彼肆之金攙合銅質。則影響於是肆之營業必巨。蓋金銅相混。不易察辨也。設有人曰。彼所鬻金。直土塊耳。則聞者咸將目爲囈語。蓋土塊之不詣爲金。固人人知之也。故南華北新之文字等於嘆語。不値識者之一顧。且不足損回敎之毫末。第其汚及多數人之祖宗。刺激性非常重大。此如糞穢雖不足殺人。然驟擲人身縱平心靜氣者當之。亦莫不勃然大怒。而加斥逐。故無怪此文之激動回敎全體之公憤。鳴鼓而攻之也。今焉。回敎代表之晉京請願於政府者。旣已滿意而歸矣。軒然巨波。頓告平息。回敎徒固爲歡忭。而非回敎徒以此案未因細故。而釀事端。亦莫不引以爲慰也。</p>
<p>以記者立於第三者地位而論。此番回敎同人。努力所獲之結果。其效率之最大者。厥爲行政院通令告誡全國。以後一切刋物。不得侮視任何宗敎一文。此不僅回敎受其益。而各敎連帶沾其惠者。且將深切感謝回敎矣。而文中「回敎人民。爲中華民國之重要成分。翊贊黨國。勞續昭著。夙爲全國所愛重」數語。尤足表彰回敎之榮譽。增高回敎之地位。其他如南華停刋。北新查封。此案負責諸人之交法院嚴懲種種。皆不能及此文價値之萬一。何則。蓋前者能受益至無窮。後者徒取快於一時耳。</p>
<p>北新之查封。是否實行或仍爲一般回敎徒注意之事。惟記者之意。回敎同人此次請願力爭之點。一爲欲明侮辱之罪。一爲欲杜後來之再犯。今者罪狀巳明。且北新亦自己認過矣。至於後來之再犯。則已有政府明令之保障。縱北新繼續存在亦决不致甘蹈法網。自貽伊戚。所謂一之爲甚其可再乎。且查封之實行與否。今責在上海市政府與特區法院。故回敎同人。不必於此再事營營。以求達其目的。北新苟實行查封。固屬快事。倘萬一竟能邀免。則回敎同人。宜本回敎仁慈之主義。不爲已甚。以表示回敎之眞正精神。而博得社會之一致好感。</p>
<p>回敎同人此次之爭是案也。鋒芒四射。照眼眩人。在局之人。義憤塡膺固無怪其無所不用其極。然局外者則以爲回敎於此似應稍加寛恕。竊嘗讀漢譯古蘭經見開卷第一句。即爲「遵奉大仁大慈安喇尊名。」讀未終卷。「主固能恕能慈。」「主固仁慈。恒宥悔罪者」之句。屢見不鮮。而其尤顯著者。厥爲第四卷泥撒宜章第三段。「主允悔過。其無知誤犯。旋即悔過者。主亦嘉納。主固至智至公。」又第五卷同章第十六段。「爲非者。自棄者。果乞宥於主主亦恕之。「又第九章愛爾拉符章第十八九段記母撒入山面主時。命其弟哈盧代理民族。哈盧於母撒去後。塑造犢象。奉之爲主。母撒歸後大怒。握弟髮。扭之至前。哈盧悔罪。母撒乃乞赦於主曰。「吁主乎其赦余。與余弟。使余輩納入慈愛中。主固慈愛之尤。」而卒邀主赦曰。「若旣搆惡幡然乞宥。矢以誠恪。主亦能恕能慈。」夫奉犢爲主。襄凟主宰。其罪之大。孰甚於此。而一旦悔罪猶蒙主赦。噫大哉回敎之「恕」道。天人一致。主所恕者。人自當恕之。孰謂回敎不重「恕」道哉。上引古蘭經譯文。回敎中之牧師與夫敎中信徒之研究經典者。當然深知之。而記者局外人復加引述者。蓋望回敎同人之篤崇此義耳。</p>
<p>記者言此。非有愛於北新而欲予以維護也。一肆之存亡。何足縈恞。且記者草此文時。當局對於封閉北新事或已佈置就緒。則記者所言。等於贅詞。特以内地各省漢回相處。彼此久已忘形。故希望回敎同人。本其經旨。得可而止。弗因一肆之存亡。而使漢回之間。長留芥蒂。况今已有第三者團體出而緩頰耶。　　此次行政院通令曾有言曰。「回敎人民。爲中華民國之重要成分。翊贊黨國。勞續昭著。」記者觀夫回敎同人之對付侮辱案也。一呼萬應。衆心如一。以是得如願以償。記者於此。不禁深有所感。以爲假使中國人民。咸能如回敎徒之受侮必報。則國勢亦何致若今日之危弱。東三省亦何致於數旬間爲日人所佔有。回敎人民。所以在吾國佔重要成分者。蓋受古蘭經薰陶所致也。古蘭經百格賴章第二十四段有言曰。「汝輩遇敵即戰。彼逐汝輩。汝輩亦還逐。以復汝居。（指此恢復失地言）暴虐之慘。過於屠戮。」噫。今日日人在東三省所施之暴虐。豈不慘於屠戮乎。使當局能如古蘭經之所言。起與敵戰。則三千萬同胞。今日亦何致陷於水深火熱中哉。回敎人民。旣於往日翊贊民國勞續昭著。竊願其今後更能遵古蘭經之遺訓。以萬衆一心之團結力。擴其愛敎之心以愛國。秉大無畏之精神。禦外侮而紓國難。則功業彪炳史册。不特爲全國人民所敬重。即全世界之人民。亦將景仰之矣。今日所受國人之區區侮辱。旣已伸其不平。而施侮者又已悔過道歉。則復何屑再予深究哉。</p>

<p>日前胡佛總統在接受共和黨推戴候選總統演說中、曾建議英國當予美國特殊貿易權利、以抵償一部份戰債、但英政府對此迄未有顯明之表示、此次牒文内、曾否提及此項建議、美京人士、刻正紛紛揣測、而尤亟盼該牒之公布、</p>
<p>此項債欵係十二月十五日到期、德國業已利用展期協定、向美政府聲明緩付英國則於此次牒文内提議重行整理查英政府共欠美國戰債四十六萬美金元、照戰債協定規定、分六十二年償付、至一九八四年償淸、迄今已償過十二萬八千六百十四萬金元、今美國財政界及實業界、亦多認英政府及其他外國政府擔負此項債務時世界經濟勢難完全回復原狀即數星期前、胡佛總統作競選演說時、亦稱歐洲國家、實無力照現行辦法付欵、故此間皆信戰債問題、必將另行協定新解法、惟美總統欲與各債務國分别考慮、反對商訂債務國集合一起之總辦法、歐洲各國亦知美總統此旨、故先由英國單獨提出云、</p>

<h3>費唐法官研究上海公共租界</h3>
<p>情形報告書第四卷（二十一）</p>
<p>（一）地產章程之修正</p>
<p>二六、倘依照業經提出之建議而進行、將地產章程之其他方面修正、則顯宜利用此項機會、將該章程第二十四欵之附伖帶條件删除、俾工部局得免受拘東、並使對於關係職員之事宜、無庸取得納稅人大會之核准、而得將現有養老金計畫内所包涵之政策、貫澈至其合乎論理之結局如此乃使一部份職員所處地位與文官相同、果能如是、則可訂立一種規則、以規定僅適用於某級間、卽列入「永久」職員名錄之内、可以列入此種規則之主要規定、經由鄙人在本報告書之一附錄内撞要叙述、（註九）、</p>
<p>二七、所可注意者、雖所擬之規定、其目的在於限制工部局所有於職員得有領取現所稱爲「最低額養老金」資格以前、得將該員罷免之權、但除職員之行爲不端外、尙有各種理由、當使該局之仍得行使此種權力、惟須將依照服務年數比例計算之一部份養老金、或其他酬報、給予該員、關於此層、工部局所有斟酌辦理之權、誠爲廣大、一般人或致以爲、「永久」字樣、並不適用於須受此種規則所控制之服務、但此種計畫所包括之原則、倘經承認、當可使在該項計畫範圍以内之該局職員所有關於任期保障之現有地位顯然大有進步、</p>
<p>關於任何此種計畫之待决問題、在如何爲所用人員、訂立合乎情理之任期保障、並如何保障工部局、使其在辦事方面、不至因職員之不勝任或不相宜而受累所謂不勝任或不相宜之職員者、即爲一般不能辦事之人、或其所任職務、適爲非其所克簷任者、</p>
<p>二八、上文所擬辦法、有一種主要之特色、即應特别組織一市府服務委員會、其任務之一、在於永久職員倘被指爲有行爲不當情事、由該委員加以調查、設使調查之結果、認爲該員確爲行爲不當、而應撤職降職或減薪、應由工部局照辦、如一永久職員、因行爲不當以外之其他理由、而經工部局擬予以撤職處分、該員得請將此項擬議、提交委員員考量、但被撤職之職員、倘仍得領取依照服務年數比例計算之一部份養老金或其他酬報、則工部局不受該委員員報告書之約束、而得將該報告書考量後、依照其所視爲適宜者辦理、</p>
<p>二九職員經撤職而被沒收其養老金及退職儲金、與被撤職而無此種沒收情事者、即此認爲判然有别、雖關於後者之事件、職員之得請求委員會出而干涉、與前者相同、便關於不牽涉沒收權利之事件、工部局在將委員會報告書考量後得自由斟酌辦理、</p>
<p>此外尙有某某數種其他任務、爲或可使所擾之委員會擔任者、當在下文叙述之、</p>
<p>（二）納稅人大會之决議</p>
<p>三○倘城最近之將來、不能將地產章程修改、則解决此項問題之第二種辦法、爲隨時由納稅人大會通過决議案、俾工部局得依照地產章程第二十欵之規定、以取得納稅人之認可、而將特殊之服務條件如第（一）項標题下之所建議者、適用於該局所欲將其列入永久名錄内之職員、如此該局可以有標、以與有關係之職員訂立合同、而不受現有地產章程所定三年期限之限制、（註十）、</p>
<p>（三）養老金條例之修改</p>
<p>三一、所擬之第三種辦、法僅爲將養老金條例修改、俾可享受養老金利益之職員、倘在達到可以享受現有養老金條例所定最低額養老金之年齡以前離職得在一定限制之内、領受依照服務年齡比例計算之一部份養老金、（未完）</p>

<h3>菊花配喚隱士麽？</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>任何文人都可以不假思索地念出一句周茂叔說的：「菊·花之隱逸者也。」因此，文人一見了菊花，便自以爲和隱逸之士相對，所有發表的作品，總把菊花當做隱士看待唉　丨菊花配喚隱士麽？不見得吧。</p>
<p>菊花配喚隱士，那麽，近兩月中，任憑到什麽地方，都可以和隱士會面，上茶寮喝茶，茶寮中有隱士：上酒樓飲酒，酒樓中有隱士：上戲館看戲，戲館中有隱士。這些隱士，都是任人搬弄的，搬到東，便東；搬到東，便西；只爲它們已抛棄了東籬故土專在熱鬧塲中供人奔走，幹那錦上添花的生活：假使周茂叔生在今日，一定不喚它們爲花中隱士，而喚它們爲共花中政客了。</p>
<p>有時開一個盛大的菊花會·菊花盆内都挿着種種的標記；便似舉行什麽盛大的政客會議，五花八門的政敹，胸前都掛着什麽徽章一般。唉丨菊花，菊花，你的政治色彩，未免太濃厚了啊！</p>
<p>我從菊花，又聯想到三春的楊花；人稱楊花輕薄，其實不然，楊花是花中的烈士。春光一去，楊花便紛紛辭樹，不怕粉骨，碎身，沾泥，入水，拚着和春光同盎；這等犧牲精神，是値得我人欽敬的。</p>
<p>與其欣賞那政客式的菊花，不如崇拜那烈士式的楊花。</p>

<p>靑蛙們在荷花池中的蓮葉上面遨遊着，歌唱着，多麽富有天趣啊！這時却來了一頭水牛，它在池邊喝水；不知怎樣地引起了靑蛙和牛比肚子的興趣來了。你想，靑蛙的肚子有幾多鼓脹的能力，終於將薄嫩的肚皮脹得四分五裂。丨博得同類的譏笑和辱詈！</p>

<h3>微婚趣話</h3>
<p>— 金不同</p>
<p>丨受欺欺人丨</p>
<p>從前我有一位同學要找配偶，高不攀，低不就，過了五六年，索性連做媒的都絕跡了。他躭心着不孝有三，無後爲大，於是乎異想天開的登報徵婚，三天廣告登過後，往報館信箱裏一取，居然取到了七封應徵信，他喜得合不攏嘴來，想這七封信之中，總可以遷遷就就的找到一位八分如意的夫人奶奶了。豈知不看還可，看了之後，幾乎回不過氣來。一封裏面說，「你要老婆，往靑蓮閣去找。」（靑蓮閣，爲上海下等娼妓最多之箎。）一封說，「待我娶妻生女後嫁你。」一封說，「這是我的小像，尊意如何？」信内附有仕女月份牌一張。一封說，「我家的老媽子，貌尙不惡，芳齡六十二，願爲介紹。」其餘三封，大同小異，都是尋開心的，一時朋友之間，都傳爲笑柄。</p>
<p>後來同學之中，看他一天一天的老大了，勸他將就些，成了家罷。於是由友人作伐，娶了一位夫人。但是他前次受了氣，心有不甘於是又去登了一天女子徵求配偶的廣告，一共收到了二十二封信。他一封一封的剪開來看，每封信裏，都附着一張照片，有的還是美術照相咧。其中穿西裝的十七張，便服的四張，軍裝的一張。穿軍裝的，還是一位參謀咧。二十二封應徵信裏面，一式的自報年齡，籍貫，學籍，職業。家　最少的有一萬，月入最少的有八十。信裏的話，比了羔羊還要和順。我那朋友，看一封·哈哈的笑一下。臨了，一封一封的退回去。他對我說，「這一下，我報了仇了。」一時朋友之間，又傳爲笑柄。</p>
<h3>鄕下人的口號</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>丨都市生活的矛盾和不平丨</p>
<p>華麗的都市中，所見的房屋，層樓高聳，電炬輝映：所走的街道，平坦寛廣，車水馬龍；所遇的人們，鮮衣華服·滿塗香澤，此外的一切一切，都呈着貴族化，摩登化，足夠使鄕下的人目眩神昏。然而還有一邊呢！鴿棚式的房間，住着大小一家，寢於斯；食於斯：連大小便亦在於斯，這也使鄕下人奇怪，因爲經濟到這般地步，鄕下是尋不到的，窮得無「一椽之庇」的乞丐，他到土地廟裏去煨砂鍋，也要比他舒服些。上海人的住，眞是不公，好的勝過瓊樓玉宇，苦的的欄豬栅都不如。</p>
<p>不論中午·晚上，任您走過那一條馬路，鼻子裏總聞着一股烹炙香味，使您饞涎欲滴。觸動了鄕下人好奇心，他細細的一考查，上海人的吃，也着實花樣多，口福好，說番菜吧，有英式·美式·法式··意式德式·日本式·俄羅斯式·說中菜吧，京帮·川帮·福建帮·本地帮·還有許多的帮，倘使您留食各飯館，遍嘗各種口味，恐怕一年亦輪不完全咧。鄕下人正在艷羡的當兒，忽然看見一副飯擔挑過，弄裏跳出幾個小小的搶飯英雄，把那殘羹冷餚都倒了去。鄕下人又想道：吃的吃，餓的餓，一個花樣眞多一個肚子呌苦。</p>
<p>穿西裝的，他身上甚麽衣料，鄕下人是呌不出名色，不過他很知道是外國來的，一寸的價錢，要抵到鄕下老布一丈多咧！摩登女郎的身上不要講，單拿伊一雙脚來算，高跟皮鞋來路貨，要幾十兩銀子；襪子純絲的，又要幾兩銀子。鄕下人想：這些銅錢在鄕下。可以蓋一座草屋，着實可以住幾個人，現在給伊們的一雙脚踐踏還不上一個月。鄕下人又不禁暗暗的眼熱，不過他走過一垜大墻壁，看見幾位伸手好漢，正拚命地撕墻上的招貼，預備當件大衣用，抵禦那尖利的西北風，他又暗暗的稱奇了。</p>
<p>鄕下人到了上海，他所看見的是矛盾，不平，他忿怒，他痛恨，因此他亦高呼着口號道：鄕間是公平的是樸實的是純潔的所在。快到鄕間來！</p>

<h3>死之贫道㈩㈢</h3>
<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>四·不可磨滅的創痕</p>
<p>愛姑在獨居生活裏，也曾想到翠微村裏的故夫劉阿根，伊也厭惡那糙黑的皮膚，蓬鬆的髮辮，大聲大氣，毛手毛脚，斷乎難認爲終身的伴侶了。那麽，别尋蹊徑罷，今年還只十九歲，寳貴的靑春，尙未過完，如何可以久蟄不動呢。動啊，怎樣的動法？動向那一條路上去？種種的問題，常在伊的腦海裏起伏着，白天有新認識的小姊妹來閒談，晚上，就感到異樣的寂寥，以前的一切，不斷地憧憬到心上來。</p>
<p>毫無家方婦經騐的伊，毫無生產能力的伊，在三個月裏，已化去了一百三十多塊錢，伊方知道夏律師對伊說的，「每月的利息，是夠衣食住了」，是一句誑話，是騙伊答應離異的一塊糖，現在這塊糖的外緣，漸漸消去了，核子是苦澀的。但是已在一張紙上畫上了「十字」，伊也知道這是無論如何，不能翻變動的一個鐵證，旣然不能從這上面生發，只好在另一方面去開源，因爲一個月三十塊錢，是最低限度了，無可再節流了。</p>
<p>伊從各個小姊妹嘴裏，打聽到伊們的生財之道，除掉有丈夫的，靠着丈夫供養以外，那香水，絲襪，小點心，剷麻將的賭本，都是自己用本能，手段去賺來的。伊雖於貞操上，毫無躊躇，恨不得把負心的韓慕良咬掉一塊肉，那裏還肯顧到他的面子，况且他又登報聲明脫離關係了呢。不過生張熟魏，朝秦暮楚，終日終夜在虚僞的，權許的操縱應付裏厮混，覺得太苦了，因此伊還不敢踏進這堕落之窟的門檻，在窟外徘徊着。却也不忍恝然舍去。</p>

<h3>銀洋市况平寂</h3>
<p>銅元回長五千</p>
<p>向例每逢星期六、以銀行祇有半天營業、故金融界市况異常　寂、卽錢莊方面、因本星期中爲秋　封關、收解手續亦殊簡略、更以市場中各種價格平安無事、可見市氣之穩固漹、惟輔幣中銅元市價、自前日大縮後、昨則回　耳、</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格（洋厘）早市釐價與前日同爲七錢一分、午市改小一毫二忽半、爲七錢○九釐八毫七忽半、（銀拆）早午兩市間爲三分、較前日較小一分、劃頭加水亦祇三四分銀根鬆懈如故、</p>

<p>丨成交四百四十萬元丨</p>
<p>昨（十二日）華商證劵交易所各債劵市况、現出貨寥落如前、全日祇開六千元、期貨市况亦不及前、市塲賣買人氣愈見沉靜、上下午合計成交四百四十萬零五千元、而鹽稅八十三萬、餘均僅在五十萬左右、整六關稅仍淸、九六金融續無市、至言各債價之趨勢、以市場人心、較前安定、新交易漸稀、各方交易似以掉期佔較多、故求供形勢甚平、各價遂仍陷於盤旋狀態、結果以賣出稍佔優勢、比前日跌三四五角不等、僅鹽稅及一九關小票現貨以連日無市、較前均漲、市面之趨勢已益見靜定矣、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>紗市受環境之影響</p>
<p>丨謠言孔多···銀根奇緊丨</p>
<p>棉紗市情、始漲繼跌、晨間以美棉上漲、致散戶抵空、市盤趨堅、但有一部份廠商套出、聞實需沉滯午後商塲上謠言驟起、時事消息不佳、空氣頓起變化、又有一說天津紗有大批來滬之說市面忽趨下游、總之環境太劣、銀根奇緊、故美棉雖漲、人心仍雖激昂、</p>
<p>▲人標續跌七八錢人禁前市開盤、隨外棉而漲、旋至二三盤回落、結果跌一二錢午後人心突變、因空氣不佳、各月跌六七八錢、全日成交統計二萬八千五百包、查賣出吉豐六百五十包、振大五百五十包、長餘六百包、同和一千五百五十包、買進明德一千包、愼記一千包、長豐七百五十包、義成五百包、茲將收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>棉市晨漲午跌</h3>
<p>棉市晨漲午跌、但美棉連漲、市勢尙好、故人心帶緊、嗣至午後商塲上謠　甚多、紗市大落、致唇齒相關之棉市、隨之而降但市上廠需漸現發展、且各路產地之價雖以鬆落、故有一部份心思較堅、美棉漲力能穩固、棉市前途恐無跌面也</p>
<p>▲鄭標近疲遠堅之局鄭標前市開盤、因美棉趨高而緊、各月漲一錢半至二錢半、午後隨紗市而跌一錢五分、全日成交總計九萬一千三百担、查賣出泰昌五千六百担、　　三零九百担、劦　四千二百担、昶記三千二百担、明德二千四百担、買進長豐五千九百担、遽記二千七百担、德降二千担、賡豐二千担、源大二千六百担、茲將收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>上週美棉趨勢漸高</h3>
<p>紐約十一日來電報告、一週中之棉市云、上週棉市初以棉貨交易起色、現棉售出較旺、及實際地位亦轉穩固而漲、不久即以套賣發旺、及週三之政府估計報告復形大增、致行回跌、惟近月價格在六分以下之時、需要即旺、且市面過軟、南方之套賣轉滯而内地之供給亦減、據上週統計一週中上市之棉、較前一週爲减、故有若干專家以爲市面之疲弱、業已過去、同業需要於買氣活躍時轉减、據另一消息、十一月期裝船之貨、有大宗額子須行抵補也、附錄週末統計於后、（單位千包）</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市日見下游</h3>
<p>滬南昨日來船仍多、約六七十號、城鄕店銷究受金融暗棉、惟同業更覺凄凉、故連日市面步鬆、尙難暢銷、是以人心一厥不振、厚糧行情復短三角　、早晚稱及雖　元步步下　、杜尖客帮略動、形勢平穩、</p>
<p>▲新閘昨日來源四十餘號、本街交易寥寥無幾、常錫北粳與江陰米各低二角、薄稻無榮辱、埠杜尖到銷二平、河下斛開二千五百石左右、</p>
<h3>客秈價跌暢銷</h3>
<p>丨閩帮辦胃復濃···北洋帮亦有問津丨</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、完全停頓、客秈未有續到、惟市價回跌後、已引起客帮之過問、福州帮辦胃又濃、天津帮亦稍問津、市面似有由疲轉定之象、統市售開江西機晚一百包、價八元六角、湖南機元米一百零九包、價十元、湖南機油四百三十六包、價八元八角半至八元八角、又機靖江三百五十包、價八元四角至八元中除湘機元爲天津帮辦去外、統係福州一帮購進、價格比之前日續小四五分、比之月初小去四五角、較之最高市價則小有七八角之鉅、惟昨日又經閩津採辦、市形或能站定云、</p>
<h3>標粉買活市穩</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈初平繼穩之象、以洋麥均無報價、雙方人心、均見沉寂、惟因抛戶不盛、買氣則尙活動、所以初開雖平、後則漸見俏利、致近期幾月、反見微好、迨至下午開盤、大戶心思甚見堅俏、因近遠各期、均明出暗進、頗欲重振旗鼓、惟早豐則南洋麥又有成交、各盤出數、約又十萬包左右、不過人心屹然不動、迨以大戶之撑擯非至山窮水盡、不肯放手也、結果本月份較前日漲七厘半、十二月份漲一分半、一月份漲二分、二月份漲一分半、三月份漲一分二厘半、四月份漲一分云、</p>
<h3>麥市初平繼挺</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈初平繼穩之象、以洋麥均無報價、人心平疲、十一十二月份不動、一二月份未開、三月份曾小三分、四月份小一分、迨至下午開盤、十一月至二月份均未開出三四月份因粉市良好、傳某廠將暢進、故人心遂爲帶好、不過洋麥續有成交、標準過好、難免壓迫也、結果三月份較小一分、四月份好一分云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白市勢略振</h3>
<p>丨價升二分半丨</p>
<p>昨日糖市、以標金堅定、荷匯微縮、人氣轉佳、並據古巴電訊、大風爲災、糖產不無損失、故公會劃盤、趨勢漸緊、廿四號粗砂白劃十四兩八錢半、比前日升二分半、同時洋行方面亦隨勢開出二十四號粗砂白現貨一批、計華新售出五百包、昌興售出一千七百包、價與劃盤同、其餘十八號中砂白以及八九十號荷赤、劃價均無上落、市象因進戶轉增、已由疲軟而穩定矣、</p>
<h3>南北貨糯米枝地價轉升</h3>
<p>丨紅米隨到隨銷···普通貨仍俏丨</p>
<p>糯米枝糯米枝近來到貨寥寥、而號行家手存亦不多、故市象已入堅穩地位、茲據產區函訊、辦價已升至一百三十五元、則申須合八十五六兩之譜、决難合逄、故乏續到、現市行盤高莊糯米枝售八十兩、却較他價爲廉、蓋係前進之貨、成本較輕所致、茲地價旣已轉昂、後市勢必隨高也、</p>
<p>▲紅米紅米前因軋缺、號貨早經斷檔、茲悉潮帮各號近有續到、連日已有開出、如上莊透心紅米開二十九兩、顆莊紅米二十七兩、上中莊二十三四兩、惟普通莊走塲較暢、因北路封河在卽、近有採辦、價至十八兩半、頗爲緊手、查市存甚缺、或須　緊也、</p>
<h3>絲茶封關洋莊絲無市</h3>
<p>昨（十二）爲總理誕辰、江海關循例封關、加以昨係本埠秋賽最後之一日、又爲星期六、各洋行大半上午休假、洋莊絲市、均無市面云、</p>
<h3>海外絲市彙誌</h3>
<p>紐約意絲輸入大暢紐約生絲市塲、因日本絲拉力不足、如單獨上機織綢容易損斷、必須搭用他國生絲、故各絲織廠對於優等意絲需要激增、存底日稀、输入大旺、上月（即十月）中意大利生絲紐約進口數量共達二千八百五十一包較九月份增一千九百三十一包云、</p>
<p>▲上月中美生絲銷量較减上月中紐約市場因選舉總統風潮、商市備受影響、絲綢銷路步趨疲滯、生絲銷費大减、昨據紐約絲綢業協會電告上月（卽十月）中紐約全市共計銷耗中日意法等國生絲五萬三千七百零三包、較九月份减六千包左右、其中華絲及意絲均各增一千或七八百包惟日絲則减七千七百九十七包、</p>
<p>▲英倫華絲價難上漲英倫市塲、涵來因日本裝到大批絲織品、售價異常低廉、較英廠出品、廉十之五六、致英倫絲織廠仔貨山積、生絲銷費大减、更兼日絲濫跌傾銷、故華絲市價難望上漲、優等白廠經開價扯合華銀每包不滿六百兩、輯里經祇扯五百五六十兩云、</p>
<h3>平水大帮美銷活動</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、湖州平水綠茶、美銷又復活動、全市共由怡和洋行及華茶公司、買進二千五百餘箱、售價四十四五兩、較前略爲堅挺、路莊綠茶、去路亦頗活躍、婺源屯溪珍眉、均有零星交易、針眉秀眉等花色、法國市場、近來略見活動、亦均電訊交易、惟售開市盤、依然有跌無漲云、</p>
<h3>五金五金行市陡起漲風</h3>
<p>昨日五金行市漲風陡起考其原因、多半因市貨斟少、客銷綿連所致、而本街實用之廠家、點綴亦繁、市情異常良好、英鋼板·馬口鐵·新鉛絲·小分釘·竹節鋼·新洋光等貨莫不紛紛提漲、而出路方面、異常鋒俏、聞昨日開出六七千担、係天津·烟台·靑島以及長江一帶客帮辦去云、</p>
<h3>純鐵洋莊已有動辦</h3>
<p>湖南純鐵、近來洋莊已有添辦、市面比前活動、行情因到貨寥少、紛紛加漲、刻市每噸估二百五十五兩、比前漲五兩、而市上現貨異常斟少人心奇好云、</p>
<h3>馬口鐵昨到五六千箱</h3>
<p>馬口鐵市上盛傳有缺貨之虞、致一般採辦者莫不抱無貨可購之嘆、昨新太古棧裝到新貨共有五千八百餘箱、一時購者雲集、成交頗多、聞巴開出千餘箱、惟將來到貨　聯不絕、市上方面定無缺貨恐慌、而行情聞目下庚子赔欵委員會現貨尙有二萬餘箱未售、因此被其東縳、殊無升漲之可能也、刻市售盤分誌於後、</p>

<h3>疋頭斜花羽紗走銷大活</h3>
<p>斜花羽紗、專製西服裏子之料、其銷埸以目下冷天爲最暢、現國貨亦有出品、質地較舶來品爲柔軟、兼有絲光而極美觀、因有人造絲混合織成、刻　批單幅售六錢半、海上西服裁縫帮齊有購用、因之舶來品大受打擊、售價曾幾次下跌、新向洋行定落者銳减、昨日該斜花羽紗市氣忽見大活、售盤復又升漲、上漲之由、因到存兩缺、供不敷求、買方四出搜多、致身價突增高昂、　批减售一兩五凈盤、零剪每碼計二元四五角不等、</p>
<h3>馬褲呢市面見好</h3>
<p>近日呢絨同益會市氣頗佳、售開出貨者甚熱鬧、馬褲呢更見良好公盤售價續漲孔士·魯麟·華綸馬褲呢一律售六兩一錢、銷場極暢因市存日缺、買方等用相率開進、下檔貨好華牌子售開五兩、大多數有行無市、均無實貨、榮泰貨售五兩七錢、比上週漲起錢餘、馬褲呢夾大衣之盛行、推昨今二年爲最興旺、</p>
<h3>煤炭博山煤價難望好</h3>
<p>丨山西煤水脚每噸漲八角丨</p>
<p>博山煤昨日成交三百噸、大盤行情表面見漲二錢半、但實際因存煤太多、且日煤又極活動、故暗盤仍售九兩七錢半、悅昇煤昨做開百餘噸、行情則未見好、計售每噸十兩云、</p>
<p>▲山西白煤日來市價步漲、並聞最近兩三日内、又有大批新貨裝來、約有四千餘噸、聞大盤尙須再漲、篩塊煤須十六兩出關、統煤亦須十五兩外、堅挺之由來、因此次裝來水脚、每噸漲起八角之故云、</p>

<h3>罩牌頭</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>丨處世藝術之八丨</p>
<p>古人所謂「擇能而使。」或曰「用當其才」等等。這種話頭現在都成過去。絕不適用。現在所最適用的。就是『罩牌頭』三字。罩牌頭三字。大約亦是上海低級社會裏所發明。但到是各級社會裏一個抽象的名詞。其中頗具至理。處處可以適用所以好。</p>
<p>今天同幾個朋友去吃酒。但是身邊「畢跌。」一切大英牌京莊羊糕荳腐湯等等的牌頭。多罩在朋友身上。昨天與小三子打架。吃了大虧。今天就去請一位「大亨」的老頭子出來。拉了幾只檯面。就把面子摘了回來。也是罩牌頭的挺硬。故牌頭越硬越好。越多越好。有了牌頭就不怕無面子。</p>
<p>上海社會裏是如此，去找尋到各個社社裏也都是如此。你要吃飯。先要去罩牌頭。你要摘面子。也要去罩牌頭。但是牌頭當中。亦顯分許多等級。有天牌牌頭。有地牌牌頭。有人牌牌頭。有我牌牌頭。從前班氏人物表。分爲九等。現在把牌頭細分起來决不止九等。假定代罩着天牌頭。自然一身吃著不盡。洋房汽車。儘你受用。就是罩着我牌牌頭。開門七件事。也包你不担心事。所以。罩牌頭最是要緊。</p>
<p>溥儀罩了日人的牌頭。做了僞國的執政。牌頭可謂硬矣。然而一些得不到實權。一切任日人的擺布。牌頭雖硬。也是無用。徒然被人駡「傀儡。」駡「漢奸」。駡冷血動物。我國罩國聯的牌頭。要想請他們來帮忙。但原來是一隻紙糊的老虎。表面雖硬。其實不硬。罩到現在。還是無聲無臭。牌頭還是罩不住。可知罩牌頭也不是容易的一件事。先要有牌頭可罩。又要罩的得法。牌頭方始有用。</p>
<p>小牌頭罩牌頭。大牌頭罩特别老牌。只此一家。别無分出的硬牌頭。罩來罩。去煞是好看。</p>

<h3>簡便易製小玩具</h3>
<p>— 可權</p>
<p>最近我做重心試騐，製造幾種物理的儀器，都告成功。這幾種儀器，也就是兒童的玩具。平常有用蠟做的，也有用木做的，學校裏買這種儀器做試騐，每件就得一元多錢，兒童賀件小的做玩具，也需洋數角，可是這種東西，多半還是由外國來的，我們自己來製造，不過費洋二三角，如能利用廢物，一個铜元不化，也可以做成。旣是這樣，我們就應該自己製造，何必化錢去買外國貨呢？所以我以所得不敢自秘，現在選出最簡便易制並且極容易成功的方示，寫之於下：</p>
<p>不倒翁我們祇要預備一個鷄蛋壳和少許泥土，就可以着手製造不倒翁。日常吃鷄蛋的時候，從小頭打個小洞，流出蛋白蛋黃，於是就拿這不要的蛋壳，把泥土裝到裏面去，再在蛋壳的上面糊上幾層紙，然後用毛筆在尖端畫上耳目算鬚，這京成爲不倒翁。</p>
<p>這個不倒翁是不用化錢，可以做成的，用來研究物理也可，用來做兒童的玩具也可。把牠放檯面上，能搖能擺動，這就是重心作用·因爲牠是上部輕來下部重。</p>
<p>奔馬京是先用一個長約七八寸，寛約四寸，厚約一寸的木板，在上邊畫個馬形，拿窄條鋸按畫綫鋸下來，再在腹部斜鑽一洞，洞中安一粗鐵絲，鐵絲的下端繫一重物，（如小磚塊石子均可）使馬的後足，放在一根横棍上，如若墜得平衡，就按那重物的重量，做一個黏土球，把牠安在鐵絲上。這樣做好後，另外再做一個木架，用來支持馬的後足，就成爲奔馬。</p>
<p>這個奔馬，用手壓牠一下，他就一上一下的動，也掉不下來，確是一種很有意思的玩具。這種物理，因爲牠的後足在木架上的地方是支點，牠的重心，却在支點以下，不在鐵絲上，是在支點下的空中，也就是支點的埀直綫上。這就可以證明，凡物的重心在支點以下，重心雖小亦不倒。</p>
<p>一足人這種玩具有製法，比奔馬更爲容易。用長約七八寸，寛約三四寸，厚約一寸的木板，在上面畫一人形，拿窄條鋸鋸下來，然後就在腰部左右，各鑽斜洞，洞中各安鐵絲，鐵絲約比牠的脚，長出二寸許，鐵絲的頭上，各安上個泥球的重物，兩個泥球，每個約三四兩重就行，再就另用一根鐵絲，穿過脛部，使牠兩手扶之，鐵絲的兩頭，捆上點碎草等物，如同人担担子的形狀。回頭就在牠直立的脚下，釘一個小釘子。另外又用一塊木板，圓的方的均可，在木板的中間鑿一洞·洞中安個木柱，把牠一個直立的足放在木柱上，牠就能站立得住，這京是一足人。</p>
<p>這個一足人，把牠放在木柱上，用手推歪牠的上部，牠左右搖動·也掉不下來，給小孩做玩具，更有趣味，這個物理·因爲牠的重心，是在牠的足以下，所以支點雖小，也是倒不了。</p>
<h3>大学堂　　如此目的！綏萬</h3>
<p>學堂寫眞</p>
<h3>國文敎員</h3>
<p>— 勗予</p>
<p>同學們坐在課室，談笑正歡的當兒，那位不識時務的國文敎員李先生，挾了講義·踱着八字步的走了進來，大家頓覺掃興</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>幾位西裝少爺，和摩登小姐，都在面部表示着鄙棄和厭惡的態度，尤其是蜜絲黃，更裝出噁心嘔吐的樣子，向地下「碎」着，並且取出那馥郁芬芳的手怕，掩鼻他顧，好像怕李先生那寒酸之氣，要沾染了她似的，</p>
<p>但李先生總是「誨人不倦」的，講得很詳細，很起勁，並且大聲疾呼道，「國文者，國粹之文也，其文化之悠久遠非世界萬國所可幾及，乃爾等後生，今竟弁髦國學，而醉心於蟹行式的西文，口有言，言西文也，筆有書，書西文也·豈非舍己從人乎？斯文又安得不掃他哉······」</p>
<p>李先生滔滔不絕，唾沬四濺的講着·但「言者諄諄，聽者藐藐·」似乎是風馬牛不相及的，學生們，有的只顧低着頭，津津有味的看「啼笑姻緣，」及其他小說，有的聚精會神的寫情書，尤其滑稽的·竟有伏在書桌上，鼾聲大作，倒像奏着有節拍的音樂，和先生的講書聲，互相唱和似的，</p>
<p>而那位熟讀李涵秋小說的吳女士s却替先生寫了一張肖像，上面題着「×××先生玉照，」遞給大家傳觀，引得哄堂大笑，</p>
<p>李先生雖然瞪了諸生一眼，但終於「敢怒而不敢言」等到大赦鐘一敲，便急急地出了課堂，</p>
<p>於是沉寂而枯瑟的課堂·頓時又一室生春·談笑歡洽，那位穿着洋裝洋氣十足，密斯脫王便首先駁斥國學的無用道，『什麽呌做「國粹」？這簡直是個落伍的廢物，不然我們這位博通國粹·滿口「之乎者也」的李先生，怎麽會終身潦倒的坐冷板橙呢？可憐他物質上的報酬，還不及一個目不識丁的工頭哩，』</p>
<p>老許附和道，「眞的，倒是英文還有些出息，我們英文敎員梁先生的束修，不是就比李先生多麽？而且他還兼職，洋行的翻譯，一個月總有幾百多塊錢的進益，這是多麽可羨······」</p>
<p>正說着，那位引起學生們羨慕的英文敎員，梁先生來了，穿首很漂亮的西裝，挾着許多金字輝煌的西書，昂然登了講座，衆學生們都被他的闊綽的洋氣征服了，大家都屛聲靜氣洗耳薛聽着</p>

<h3>一個驕者受窘</h3>
<p>— 永炯</p>
<p>火柴的價値</p>
<p>多年不見的許君，恰巧昨天在××路碰着了。</p>
<p>「密司脫許，長久不見了，你好嗎」？我含笑的問。</p>
<p>「托福，托福，」他也點着頭笑咪咪的答。</p>
<p>我倆招呼了一番，立着談了一回别後的境况，據他說剛從南京來的，蒙他告訴我一椿很有趣味的事情，今特地錄出來，以供讀者一閱：</p>
<p>今天：我（許君自稱）趁早班火車來，坐在頭等車，車廂裏只有我和一個穿西裝的少年倆人，我很覺寂寞，吸吸香烟消消遣，所以將一盒火柴也放在面前的桌子。</p>
<p>他神氣活現，也不招呼一聲，伸手將我的火柴盒拿去，劃着吸得烟，用後又毫不客氣煌擲還我的面前。當時我本想駡他一頓，仔細一想，不如裝着不學得的樣子，將計就讦的懲戒他一下。</p>
<p>車過××站，車裏檢查員必定將搭客們車票檢查一回，以防漏失。剛查到我的時候，我就裝着很鎭靜的樣子，慢慢地將火柴盒抽開來。　　「咦丨奇怪了丨我車票明明藏在這盒裏，一霎時怎麽沒有了，」我裝着很驚慌樣子的說。</p>
<p>他好似吃了一驚，呆呆地看着我一聲也不響。</p>
<p>「這裏車廂·只有我和你兩個人，别人沒有進來過的，我好像記得你曾拿過我的火柴盒呢？」我有意釘着他的問。</p>
<p>「我丨我丨拿是拿過的，但沒有見着車票」他面孔頓時紅起來了，嘴裏囁嚅着的答。</p>
<p>「車票的的確確藏在這盒裏，哈哈·笑話·沒有人拿去·怎麽會沒有呢？</p>
<p>」我更進一步釘着他。</p>
<p>「快些，快些，我們要到别處去查了，」檢查員不耐煩地的催着。</p>
<p>「好···好···我賠，我賠，」他現出侷促不安的樣子。又對着檢查員的說：「補張票要多少錢呢？」</p>
<p>「照理頭等車要十一塊一角錢，現在要補票，照章罰一倍，共要二十二塊二角錢」檢查員很神氣的答。</p>
<p>他照數給了檢查員，補着一張車票交給我，他好似很懊惱地朝着車窗出神了。</p>

<h3>愛國的小偷</h3>
<p>— 芮禹成</p>
<p>黑暗的戶口已把地球呑沒了；萬有的一切都套上玄色的衣裳，顯不出淸楚的輪廓；惟有閃爍的街燈，睜開惺忪的倦眼，在夜色濔漫中戰慄。</p>
<p>已近三更的時分了，衖裏發出狺狺的吠聲；原來有一條糢糊的人影在牆脚根下搖幌。狗子彷彿也懷着勢利的心理，對這個鶉衣百結的人影越呌越起勁了，一直等到他躡進一個人家的大門。</p>
<p>那人家實際幷不是住戶，還是一個辦公的機關；中堂裏七横八竪地安置着幾張寫字檯，果皮栗殻狼籍面上。書報文具之類，都遮着濃厚的塵灰，伏在案頭生病。迎面的壁　上懸着總理的遺容，黨國旗傾斜地掛在兩邊。遺囑已斯去一半，看不出牠的全文。</p>
<p>進門的人影無欵地是一個小偷了。他摸出電筒來亮了一亮，看見總理的遺像，兀自嚴肅地鞠了三躬。然後側耳細聽，西首的房裏有一種鼾睡的呼聲露透出來。他先在中堂裏四顧了一回，怎奈搜不出些微値錢的什物，他只有悄悄地鑽進房門了。</p>
<p>偶然睡熟者發出囈語的音響，小偷就接着假裝幾聲的貓呌。這樣約莫過了一刻鐘的光景，他担心弔膽地挾着許多衣物出來了。他將衣物放在檯上，喘了一口氣，便亮起電筒檢視一番；只見衣物裏夾有一面國旗和一面黨徽，他躊躇起來了；最後好像毅然地决定主張，將黨國旗再送到房裏去。</p>
<p>轟然一聲，不知是什麽東西碰倒了，驚醒了睡熟的主人，狂呼着『有人！</p>
<p>听賊！』接着就是擦火柴的聲音，人起牀的聲音，終於聽見小偷呌饒的話語了。</p>
<p>『啊，饒饒我吧！我若不是敬重黨國旗，把牠送還給你，我老早就走脫了！東西都在外面，一件不少；原物奉趙，也就算了，請你饒恕吧！』聽了他的語音很爽利，斷定他必然不是平凡的小偷。</p>
<p>『胡說！撒謊！你還知道愛國嗎？</p>
<p>你還知道敬重黨國旗嗎？我老實告訴你，此地辦公的許多先生，都是在黨國服務的，你這小偷還能夠認眞地愛國嗎？···』一陣說話的聲音過後，就是手掌與耳光接觸的響聲。</p>
<p>『啊喲，你不要打我，我的確是句句實言！我幷不是甘做小偷的人，何嘗不是高級中學的畢黹生？只怪社會上沒有吃飯的地方，又沒有姊姊妹妹許配闊人；眼看要活活地餓死，才墮落到這步田地！其實，什麽「革命主義」，「黨義知識」，我那一樣不知道呢！···』</p>
<p>『我也不信你這些鬼話，還因爲你沒有偷去東西，饒你初次；下回再碰到手裏，就沒有好生活給你吃了！滾了吧！』</p>
<p>他沒粗打采地走出大門，月光下顯出他頰旁的兩行熱淚犬·吠聲送他出了衖口，不知他再到那裏去覓他的生計呢，</p>

<h3>爲兒童們呼籲</h3>
<p>— 張逸菲</p>
<p>在上海，我們的兒童太可憐了，沒有一家影戲院是爲了兒童們而設立的，也沒有一張影片是爲了兒童們而映演的。</p>
<p>電影，原本是敎育的利器，我們應該如何的充分利用來發揮他的敎育的功能，使與學校敎育相得而益彰。可是理論固然是如此，事實却明明擺在眼前，上海雖然多的是高聳雲表的電影院，但我們若仔細的檢討了一下，可以說沒有一家電影院是懸有敎育的目標的。</p>
<p>他們所映的片子，或者是「香艷」的，或者是「神怪」的，而以前者爲尤多，無非是供結「有閒階級」的成人作消閒品，一方面是忽略了電影藝術的表演，一方面也忘掉了電影的敎育的功能了。專誠爲了敎育，爲了兒童而攝一張片子，那簡直是奇事。所以在上海，要找幾張兒童値得看的片子，簡直是沒有。兒童們或是被擯斥於門外，或是看了反受惡劣的影響。</p>
<p>一般家長們因了愛護子女的緣故，在自己到電影院裏去的時候，常常的帶着自己的子女一同去看那實在不適宜於他們看的影片。其結果，是反增加了這般家長的罪戻，使兒童純潔無瑕的心版上，刋上了着色的汚點。這就是說，兒童從惡劣的或不適宜於他們看的影片中，得到了惡劣的敎育，或許會影響到他的一生。</p>
<p>現在世界進步的國家，像英美日本蘇聯等，對於電影的敎育的功能，都非常的注意，所以兒童電影院的設立和給兒童看的電影的映演，簡直是極普通的事。難道我們中國在這一點上也要落後於他國麽？</p>
<p>前幾天我在報上看見說上海將有兒童電影院的設立，這也許是事實，也許不能成爲事實，我們只好等待着將來的來到，詥彰這消息的確否。</p>
<p>總之，在這樣廣大的上海社會中，是很需要着爲兒童們的電影的。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>談「愛的創痕」</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>愛的創痕（BorntoLove）是多麽著名的片子啊，但是看了以後，你大約會說一句，有負盛名，實際上，牠仍是一張很好的片子，不過我們對於牠，希望如果太奢的話，就會覺得牠是平淡。</p>
<p>情節是採用歐戰作背景，和無聲的戰地之花有聲的飛鷹軍，走了同一的路，這種片子，給我們太多了，所以不能人呌太高興，也是覺得牠平淡的一因，牠述一個女子的情人，上沙塲去和平消息傳到倫敦，而那情人死耗，也傳到了那女子耳中，她不得已才下嫁。以後有了一個孩子，才知道她情人沒死，却又到了英倫，爲了丈夫的見疑，就離婚了，不過唯一的愛子，被丈夫取去，而情人也巳回國，不久，情人二次歸來，但是不幸的事，也就在她們重聚的一霎時，她得到了情人但是久别的愛子，却是死了。</p>
<p>故事這樣的，前一半非常鬆弛，精彩</p>
<h3>十全的女明星</h3>
<p>— 心</p>
<p>西席地密爾，又有一張新片子了，呌作TheSignfotheCross·但是籌備了許久，仍不能開攝，因爲他在「明星多於天上」的米高美公司，和别的地方，都找不到一位適合於這牉中，飾Ancaria一角的女子。地密爾定的標準太苛了，他一定要一個十全的女明星；有一雙像蘭瑙爾烏麗克LenoveUlric那樣閃爍和熱情的眼睛，有一雙像Pavlowa那種嬌柔和優美的玉手，腿要有瑪琳黛德的匀稱，聲音要像JorephineBaher一樣動人，而含有幽鬱，以外還要有同GildaCray一樣的天才表情，和像嘉寳的神秘誘惑性，這樣十全的人，那裏有呢？</p>
<p>完全在後半部。</p>
<p>康絲登裴奈特ConstanceBennett,，是很好的，比如說那離婚的一幕，和情人的歸來，都有極動人的表演，傑爾麥克利JoelMcCrea,，也是好的對手，可惜給他表演的機會太少了，保爾卡文那夫，PaulCavanagh,，飾一個純粹英國貴族派，非常稱職，其餘人就只有極少的表演了。</p>
<p>有許多地方，用側寫和暗寫，都證明導演的手腕和能力，增加了這片子許多力量，攝影光線，都還不錯，有幾個鏡頭很妙。</p>
<p>康絲登發見愛子之死的一段，和屢次點示金十字架，（定情紀念物，）都是很可注意的，末幾幕，愁雲慘霧，更加了摧動心情的音樂，給觀衆臨行時一個深深的刺激。</p>
<p>這片似乎太長了，大約有一萬多尺吧，有許多可減的，如描寫軍醫院，和慶祝和平紀念，都延到三百尺以上，實在太虚耗，而對於歐戰空軍，却攝得不夠　結論是，牠是一張很不錯的片子，不過看牠以前，不要先有奢望。</p>

<h3>眼高手低的聰敏人</h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>美國的「銀幕美男子」范倫梯諾曾經說過，「今日銀幕上的幾位明星，每一位都是從前刻苦用功的靑年男女」。朋友！　你不要誤信那些不成器的話，以爲明星是由放蕩浪漫的生活造成的。你要知道，不刻苦用功而希望成功明星，那是草創時代的徼倖事。你要在未來的攝影場裏去顯出好身手，你就非刻苦用功訓練自己不可！</p>
<p>有人嘲笑你，挖苦你，說你練習是徒勞無功的。你不要去怕他，我告訴你說，這社會是不容人的丨這社會裡充滿了一班專批評人而自己决不實行的聰敏人。這些聰明人自己知道，他們犯一個通病就是「眼高手低」專批評人纔可以顯出他們的「眼高。」自己不幹纔可以遮掩他們的「手低。」這些聰敏人是忌恨人向上進步的！對於刻苦用功的人是不會同情的！我們中國凡百事業不如東西各國京因爲這樣的聰敏人太多的緣故。</p>
<p>愛藝術的同志！我老實告訴你說吧！用十字架釘殺耶穌的就是他！在大西洋的海面上想謀殺哥倫布的就是他！不許牛敦證明地球是圓形的就是他！高呼打倒用水蒸汽推動機器的瓦德的也就是他！他是忌恨人成功的！他是喜歡人失敗的！這社會裏到處充滿了這樣的魔鬼！</p>
<p>以配音的默片。蘇俄之所以仍注意默片之攝製，是爲了要銷行國際的緣故。</p>
<p>（第三）德國算是第三，預算表中有一百五址部出品，準備在來年攝製。</p>
<p>（第四）英國緊跟着德國，預備出一百四十部。</p>
<p>（第五）法國的攝影塲也計算攝製差不多有九十部的樣子。</p>
<p>（第六）富國也巳經宣佈過要出二十部片子。</p>
<p>總上所述，共有一千五百四十部，除了蘇俄的默片三百四十部外，其餘的一千二百部都是聲片。這一千二百部出品只是一種語言的普通長片，其他的短片和未經正式宣佈的一切出品都不在内。　　談到我國，關於這種有系統的預算，根本沒有，大槪是「無庸多此一舉」吧！因此當然也無從知道民國二十二年的中國影片有多少了！</p>

<p>海外珍聞</p>
<h3>電影女明星牛奶淴浴</h3>
<p>— 桀克</p>
<p>從前上海雜上有一個無　的謠旨，說我國鼎鼎大名的外交家，有一個姨太太，愛淴牛奶浴。據說牛奶浴有使皮膚光白肌肉豐潤的功效。這個謠言畢竟無從證實。現在好萊塢的電影女明星，居然眞的淴起牛奶浴來了。我們不久就能夠在銀幕上看見。</p>
<p>影片上利用女明星淴浴以誘惑觀衆的一幕是大導演家西席地密爾發明的。好幾年來，他把這淴浴一幕盡量發揮。其他導演也相率效尤。因使電影劇生色不少。最近他更便使女明星大淴其牛奶浴，造成了電影史上的新紀錄。</p>
<p>在地密爾的JheSignoftheCross新片裏，有一個很大很大的黑大理石羅馬式浴池，滿滿的盛着潔白的牛奶，以女明星克樂特珂爾佩扮荒淫的羅馬皇后蒲比亞，在裏面淴浴。在製片的時候，她赤條條的在牛奶浴池裏而浮沉了八小時之久，製成製片塲淴浴一幕最長的紀錄。可是收映到銀幕上的只不過一刹那就完了。</p>
<p>地密爾在導演這幕浴景的時試用過别種白色流質，因爲在攝影上終不及牛奶，白粉恐怕有損克樂特的肌膚，所以也沒有用。後來就拿一千加侖的牛奶，傾倒在巨大的羅馬浴池裏。</p>
<p>據說地密爾考據出蒲比亞是用驢奶淴浴的，所以他爲眞確起見，也想用驢奶，不過觀對於驢奶牛奶看不出什麽分别，所以也就馬虎一些。</p>
<p>克樂特是電影明星中淴牛奶浴的第一人。她說古羅馬的女人是不錯的，牛奶浴確有美容的功效。牛奶浴身之後，她覺得肌膚溫柔滋潤。牛奶浴身太浪費了，她想以後用牛奶洗面凈臂</p>

The Ogawara Detachment is constructing solid trenches, five feet wide and seven feet deep, in the Hou Yaokule area, relying on the terrain to attack the 700 volunteer soldiers commanded by Sun Hongyu. With the help of air cover, they occupied Hou Yaokule at 1:00 PM the same day. In this battle near Fularji, the Japanese army suffered losses, with 13 killed and over 50 wounded.

After the Japanese army finally occupied Hou Yaokule, investigations revealed that it was guarded by the 2nd Brigade of Heilongjiang Province under Su Bingwen and 2,000 Red Spears. Inspection of the captured goods revealed that they possessed Type 3 machine guns and other advanced weapons. The base's walls were fortified with moats three meters wide and deep, and the ramparts had corner bastions for defense, creating a very solid position. As a result, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses, with 20 killed and 50 wounded. (December 12th Rengo News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Dagu Mountain Recaptured by Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Military news from the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association reports that correspondent Sun Dejian telegrams that (1) our army recaptured Dagu Mountain at 5:00 AM on the 5th of this month. In this operation, the commander of the puppet army, Li Shoushan, was shot, ingested gold, and died. The reason was that the Japanese army in the rear forced him too harshly, the attack in the front was too fierce, and he could not retreat or surrender. Furthermore, the families of the puppet army were guarded by the Japanese army, placing Li Shoushan in a dead end. Therefore, our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the puppet army and the Japanese army were defeated. About three regiments surrendered with their weapons. Over 300 puppet and Japanese soldiers were killed, 57 Japanese soldiers were captured, and two enemy machine guns and over 300 rifles were seized. (2) Our soldiers now have cotton clothing, but the weather there has suddenly turned cold, and it has already snowed. It is not uncommon for hands and feet to be frostbitten, which is extremely pitiful. (December 12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Electric Fences Around Harbin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Military news from the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association reports that a person from Harbin states that there are electric fences around Harbin. The Majiagou airfield covers over 100 acres and has 56 aircraft. The garrison is the 10th Division, commanded by Commander Hirose, who also serves as the commander of the Harbin Japanese-Manchu Joint Temporary Garrison. Local administration is also under his control. Volunteer armies nearby attack every few days. The Russo-Japanese agreement does not allow anyone to stay east of Haining Station. Currently, between Haining and the border, Ding and Li's troops maintain the status quo, often operating east of Ashihe, over 900 li west of Haining. (December 12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military news from the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association reports that Commander Gao Wenbin of Kangping reports that, according to a captured Japanese spy, enemy officer Huang Mu (a Japanese national) is gathering the East Asia Alliance Army, recruiting local militias, village guards, and bandits, attempting to eliminate the volunteer army. Due to the generous treatment offered, many in Liaodong counties have turned traitor. The situation on the front lines is increasingly urgent. The Japanese are using threats and inducements, doing everything possible. If we continue to neglect this, the starving army will be left waiting for food, which is very worrying. We earnestly request that supplies be provided as soon as possible. (December 12th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sun Yat-sen's Birthday Commemoration Conference</h3>
<p>Wu Zhihui Reports on Sun Yat-sen's Doctrine</p>
<p>Foreign Ships at Xiaguan All Raise the Chinese National Flag</p>
<p>All Agencies and Schools Work as Usual</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a Sun Yat-sen's Birthday Commemoration Conference on the morning of the 12th. Participants included Central Committee members Wu Zhihui, Ju Zheng, He Yingqin, Chen Shuren, Chen Guofu, and other ten people, as well as representatives from various agencies and all colleagues, about 700 people in total. The meeting was presided over by Ju Zheng, a member of the Standing Committee. Wu Zhihui reported, stating that today is the 67th birthday of Sun Yat-sen. We should have celebrated it with great fanfare, but due to the current national crisis, we have stopped large-scale celebrations. Sun Yat-sen is the creator of our party. Now we cannot even celebrate his birthday with great fanfare. This is such an unpleasant thing. Sun Yat-sen was born in a time of national crisis and was meant to solve all the difficulties. He submitted a letter to Li Hongzhang proposing several things, intending to use his power to solve small difficulties. However, Li Hongzhang never understood the great principle of making the best use of people, land, things, and the smooth flow of goods. Sun Yat-sen felt that these things could not be taught, so he took on all the responsibilities himself. Speaking of Sun Yat-sen's doctrine, it has unique aspects. For example, nationalism is not about expanding one's own power to conquer others, like imperialism. Imperialism will never succeed. Even with many years of preparation, William II could not conquer other nations. Japan is far inferior to Germany, yet it is complacent and wants to repeat Germany's mistakes, without any sense of shame. Sun Yat-sen's doctrine cannot be understood by their superficial perspectives. After the report, the meeting was adjourned. (December 12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 12th, Sun Yat-sen's birthday, at noon, our naval ship "Yi Xian" at Xiaguan fired a 21-gun salute.

<p>Current Events Commentary</p>
<h3>A RECENT LITERARY CASE INVOLVING BOUNDARIES</h3>
<p>Any religion that has existed for thousands of years and has tens of millions of followers must possess a unique spirit that can move the masses and endure the test of time. Therefore, the foundation of a religion is as solid as a towering mountain, and it cannot be shaken by the efforts of one or two individuals. However, all things and emotions tend to differ in their preferences, with some embracing and others rejecting, which is the constant nature of humans. Therefore, people tend to revere their own religion and rarely speak well of others. In the past, during autocratic eras, religions were often belittled and viewed as acts of great treason, even punishable by death. Socrates, the father of Western philosophy, was killed for expressing truths that contradicted religious doctrines, a tragedy that is still lamented by later generations. However, in modern times, with the increasing development of liberalism, freedom of belief and speech has been granted. Even the open advocacy of atheism is not prohibited. Religions have also shifted from being mysterious to becoming more socialized and have even become a specialized field of study. After studying them, people inevitably discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Those who are dissatisfied with these discussions may write articles to refute them or publish books to attack the religions that others follow. Such books are frequently seen in the publishing world of Europe and America without any fear or restraint. This is because truth becomes clearer with debate, just as a precious mirror becomes brighter with polishing. However, this is only the work of a very small number of writers. As for ordinary believers, they generally ignore criticisms of religion and are not surprised by them. This is because the true nature of things lies within their essence, and cannot be enhanced or diminished by praise or criticism. It is like the sun and moon in the sky, which, even when occasionally obscured by passing clouds, still retain their brilliance. Furthermore, since the modern trend has swept across the globe, all academic disciplines have shown a "new" trend. As a result, reformist factions have emerged within various religions in response to the times. These new and old factions inevitably criticize each other, but they all take the position of debating the truth and rarely engage in any conflicts.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we adopt a scholarly and solemn attitude towards various religions, discussing their strengths and weaknesses in a logical manner to provide a basis for exploration by the general public, then it is permitted under freedom of speech. However, if we use the vulgar language of a boor to insult others with obscene words, causing them distress for our own amusement, then this constitutes an insult to religion and should be prohibited and punished. The writings published by the Nanhua Literary Society and the Beixin Bookstore fall into this category. However, at first glance, these writings may seem serious, but upon closer inspection, they are, as the Executive Yuan's circular stated, a "minor incident." To illustrate, if someone were to slander a gold shop, saying that the gold it sells is mixed with copper, it would definitely have a huge impact on the shop's business, as gold and copper are not easily distinguishable. However, if someone were to say that the gold sold by the shop is just a lump of earth, then the listener would regard it as nonsensical, as everyone knows that earth cannot be mistaken for gold. Therefore, the writings of Nanhua and Beixin are like sighs, not worthy of attention by knowledgeable people and not capable of harming Islam in the slightest. However, they insult the ancestors of many people, which is extremely provocative. It is like dung, which, while not capable of killing someone, would cause even a calm and collected person to become enraged and retaliate if it were suddenly thrown at them. Therefore, it is no wonder that this article has stirred up the public outrage of the entire Islamic community, leading to a full-scale attack. Now, the representatives of the Islamic community who went to Beijing to petition the government have returned satisfied. The huge waves have subsided, and the Islamic community is rejoicing. Non-Muslims are also comforted that this case did not escalate into a conflict due to a minor matter.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a third-party reporter, the most effective result of the efforts of the Islamic community in this matter is the Executive Yuan's circular warning the entire country that all publications must not insult any religion in the future. This not only benefits Islam but also brings benefits to all religions, who will deeply appreciate the Islamic community for this. Furthermore, the phrases in the circular, such as "Muslim people are an important component of the Republic of China, and their contributions to the party and the country have been remarkable and consistently recognized, and they have always been loved and respected by the entire nation," are sufficient to express the honor of Islam and enhance its status. Other measures, such as the suspension of Nanhua's publication and the sealing of Beixin, as well as the severe punishment of those responsible for this case by the court, cannot match even one ten-thousandth of the value of this circular. This is because the former can bring endless benefits, while the latter only provides temporary satisfaction.</p>
<p>Whether the sealing of Beixin will be implemented is still a matter of concern for the general Islamic community. However, in the reporter's opinion, the points that the Islamic community has been fighting for in this petition are: first, to clarify the crime of insult; second, to prevent future offenses. Now that the crime has been clarified and Beixin has admitted its fault, the government has issued a clear order to guarantee against future offenses. Even if Beixin continues to exist, it will never dare to violate the law again and bring trouble upon itself. As the saying goes, "Once is more than enough, how can it be repeated?" Furthermore, whether or not the sealing will be implemented is now the responsibility of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Special District Court. Therefore, the Islamic community does not need to continue to work towards this goal. If Beixin is indeed sealed, it would be a joyous occasion. However, if it is spared by chance, then the Islamic community should adhere to the benevolent principles of Islam and not go too far, in order to demonstrate the true spirit of Islam and win the unanimous approval of society.</p>
<p>In this case, the Islamic community's struggle was fierce and dazzling. Those involved were filled with righteous indignation, so it is no wonder that they used every means at their disposal. However, outsiders believe that the Islamic community should show some leniency in this matter. I have read the Chinese translation of the Quran and found that the first sentence of the opening chapter is "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful." Throughout the book, the phrase "Allah is Forgiving and Merciful" is frequently seen. The most prominent example is in the third section of the fourth chapter, "Women": "Allah accepts repentance from those who do evil in ignorance and then repent soon afterwards; it is they to whom Allah will turn in forgiveness, and Allah is ever Knowing and Wise." Another example is in the sixteenth section of the fifth chapter, "The Table Spread": "Those who do wrong and abandon themselves, if they seek forgiveness from their Lord, He will forgive them." Also, in the eighteenth and nineteenth sections of the ninth chapter, "Repentance," it is recorded that when Moses went up the mountain to meet with God, he ordered his brother Aaron to lead the people. After Moses left, Aaron molded a calf idol and encouraged the people to worship it. When Moses returned, he was furious and grabbed his brother by the hair, dragging him forward. Aaron repented, and Moses prayed to God, saying, "O my Lord, forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of the merciful." And God granted forgiveness, saying, "If they do evil and then repent and act righteously, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful." Worshipping the calf as God is a great blasphemy against the Lord. Yet, once they repented, they were still forgiven by God. Ah, how great is the "forgiveness" of Islam, consistent with heaven and humanity. What God forgives, people should also forgive. Who says that Islam does not value "forgiveness"? The above translation of the Quran is certainly well known to imams and those who study the scriptures in the Islamic community. As an outsider, I have added these references in the hope that the Islamic community will earnestly uphold this principle.</p>
<p>I say this not because I have any affection for Beixin and want to protect it. The existence or demise of a bookstore is not worth worrying about. Furthermore, when I drafted this article, the authorities may have already made arrangements to close Beixin, in which case what I have said would be redundant. However, because the Han and Hui people in various inland provinces have long lived in harmony, I hope that the Islamic community will adhere to its religious principles and stop when appropriate, and not allow a bookstore's existence or demise to leave a lasting rift between the Han and Hui people. Moreover, there are already third-party organizations coming forward to mediate. The Executive Yuan's circular stated, "Muslim people are an important component of the Republic of China, and their contributions to the party and the country have been remarkable and consistently recognized." I have observed the Islamic community's response to the insult case, and their unanimous and united action has enabled them to achieve their goals. I cannot help but feel deeply impressed by this. I believe that if the Chinese people could all retaliate against insults as the Muslims do, then the national strength would not be as weak as it is today, and the three northeastern provinces would not have been occupied by the Japanese in a matter of weeks. The reason why Muslim people occupy an important component in our country is due to the influence of the Quran. In the Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 191, it is said: "And fight them until there is no more fitnah (disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah) and (all and every kind of) worship is for Allah (Alone). But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun (the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)." Alas, is not the brutality inflicted by the Japanese in the three northeastern provinces today more cruel than slaughter? If the authorities could have risen up to fight the enemy as the Quran says, then the thirty million compatriots would not be trapped in misery today. The Muslim people have already made remarkable contributions to the Republic of China in the past. I sincerely hope that they can continue to follow the teachings of the Quran in the future, and with the united strength of all people, expand their love for their religion to love their country, and with a spirit of great fearlessness, resist foreign aggression and relieve the national crisis. Then their achievements will be recorded in history, and they will not only be respected by the people of the country, but also admired by the people of the world. The petty insults they have suffered from the Chinese people today have already been redressed, and the offenders have already repented and apologized. Why bother to investigate further?</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>The War Debt Issue Will Take a Sudden Turn</h3>
<p>The French Government Follows the British in Sending a Note to the US Government</p>
<p>President Hoover Reads the Dispatch and Sets Off to Return to Beijing</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Simon Meets with the French, Italian, and Belgian Ambassadors</p>
<p>National News Agency, November 11, Bar Harbor dispatch: President Hoover departed from here at 8:57 PM tonight to return to Beijing.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, November 11, Washington dispatch: Secretary of State Stimson stated today that the British note regarding the war debt issue has been submitted to President Hoover and will likely not be released within two days. The French note to the US government regarding the war debt issue was received this evening and is largely similar to the British note.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, November 11, Washington dispatch: It is now confirmed tonight that the war debt issue will transcend the political realm and be based purely on the global economic situation for resolution. With the US government having received the British and French notes, there is no doubt that the war debt repayment methods will be revised.</p>
<h3>Important French Financial Figures Gather in London</h3>
<p>Reuters, November 11, London dispatch: Foreign Minister Sir John Simon has met with the French, Belgian, Italian, and other ambassadors to report on the contents of the British note to the US government regarding the war debt issue. It is rumored that the contents of the British note will be kept strictly confidential for the time being, pending Stimson's response before deciding whether to publish it. News from Paris states that the French government, following the British precedent, has also sent a note to the US government regarding the war debt issue, making certain claims. It is noted that the French debt to the US due this time is to be paid on February 15th of next year. Former French cabinet member and current chairman of the Finance Committee, Malvy, will come to London soon. His purpose may be to discuss extending the deadline for suspension of war debt payments before a formal war debt conference is held. In addition, former French Finance Minister Flandin will also come to England to meet with the British Trade Minister Runciman. The arrival of these figures in England is sufficient to show the importance attached to the war debt issue by all parties. So far, the French government has not expressed its attitude on the war debt issue, but Reuters' Paris reporter has learned that the financial attaché of the French Embassy in the United States has been ordered by the French government to request the US government to extend the deadline for suspension of war debt payments. ▲ Havas News Agency, November 11, Paris dispatch: Finance Minister Germain Martin, accompanied by senior officials from the Ministry of Finance, visited Prime Minister Herriot today to discuss the debt to the United States due on December 15th. After the discussion, the Finance Minister told people that the government had consulted with the United States on this matter, but due to diplomatic etiquette, it was not convenient to disclose the details.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, November 11, Washington dispatch: US President Hoover has prepared to return to Beijing. He received the British dispatch on reorganizing war debts at the Bar Harbor home. It is now reported that Secretary of State Stimson stated that after receiving the dispatch, he immediately forwarded it to the President. As for its content, Stimson refused to disclose or comment, but said that it would soon be announced simultaneously by the British and American governments. France and Italy have not yet sent dispatches to the United States, but it is expected that they will follow Britain soon, as Britain, adhering to its traditional policy and adding the results of the Lausanne Conference, occupies the leading position among debtor nations regarding the war debt issue.</p>
<p>During his speech accepting the Republican nomination for presidential candidate, President Hoover suggested that Britain grant the United States special trade rights to offset a portion of the war debt. However, the British government has not yet made a clear statement on this matter. Whether this suggestion was mentioned in the dispatch is currently being speculated by people in Washington, and they are eagerly awaiting the publication of the dispatch.</p>
<p>This debt is due on December 15th. Germany has already used the extension agreement to declare to the US government that it will postpone payment to Britain, while the British government has proposed reorganizing it in this dispatch. The British government owes the United States a total of 4.6 million US dollars in war debt, which is to be repaid in sixty-two years according to the war debt agreement, until it is cleared in 1984. So far, over 12.8614 million US dollars have been repaid. Now, many in the American financial and industrial circles also believe that the world's economy is difficult to fully recover when the British government and other foreign governments bear this debt. A few weeks ago, President Hoover also stated during his campaign speech that European countries are indeed unable to pay according to the current method. Therefore, it is believed here that the war debt issue will inevitably be subject to a new agreement and a new solution. However, the US President wants to consider each debtor country separately and opposes negotiating a general solution for all debtor countries together. European countries also know the President's intention, so Britain took the lead in submitting the proposal independently.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, November 11, Washington dispatch: It was learned tonight that France has also sent a dispatch to the US government proposing to reorganize the war debt issue. It is rumored that both the British and French dispatches will be sent to President-elect Roosevelt for consultation before the US government decides on its position. The contents of the French dispatch have not been published.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, November 11, London dispatch: Sir Robert Kindersley arrived in Southampton, England from New York today. He briefly stated to reporters that he believed the United States would adopt a sympathetic and reasonable attitude towards the debt issue.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, November 12, Washington dispatch: The fact that the British government has proposed the war debt issue shortly after the US presidential election has aroused considerable and cautious criticism here. Politicians say that the United States can gain something in return for revising European debts. President Hoover will take a short break after the election campaign and return to Washington within two days. The British document will be published simultaneously in Britain and the United States. Democratic Senator Robinson stated today that if the President declares that the current debt payment method is the final solution and cannot be changed, then the global economic situation can tend to stabilize and not cause so much turmoil.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, November 12, Washington dispatch: Senator Reed, as the President's personal representative, traveled to Europe. He has already declared that Congress may not approve of further extending the war debt issue. Even if the debtor countries default next Tuesday, he believes that Congress will immediately bring it up for discussion. Reed knows the attitude of Congress well and, as he represents the President after inspecting the European economic situation, his statements are often considered to have the President's approval. Now that Reed has stated that Congress does not approve of delaying, it is enough to punish the United States, which also wants to start talks with the debtor countries as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As for President Hoover, today he telegraphed that his special train would only stop briefly at Greendale to see his son, indicating that the President also believes that this matter must be paid attention to immediately, and he must explain his attitude when reporting on the state of the nation to Congress on December 5th.</p>
<p>It is expected that President-elect Roosevelt, along with his future Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury, will also participate in the discussion. The British and French dispatches to the US government decision may not be published temporarily, but will be disclosed when the President reports on the state of the nation to Congress, and the Democratic Party's attitude on this issue can also be learned at that time. It is heard that the Democratic Party's internal opinions are not yet fully consistent. For example, Smith advocates extending the repayment, even for one or two decades is fine, while other leaders support appropriate reductions. Before Roosevelt expresses his views to Hoover, he must first unify the party's views.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, November 11, Paris dispatch: The French government decided today to follow Britain's example and consult with the Washington government on the deferred payment of war debts. Part of the French debt to the United States, about 25 million US dollars, is due on December 15th. France plans to extend the payment period. The Paris newspaper "Le Matin" reported that the financial counselor of the French Embassy in Washington has contacted the US State Department to re-discuss the war debt issue.</p>
<h3>Issue of Equality in Armaments</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Simon Will Go to Geneva</p>
<p>New British and French Proposals Can Be Submitted Soon</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, November 11, Geneva dispatch: According to those familiar with the League of Nations, British Foreign Minister Simon will come to Geneva around Sunday or Monday to submit the British solution to the issue of equality in armaments to the main committee of the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>A new plan for French construction armaments and safety, etc., will also be passed by the French cabinet on Monday and will be sent simultaneously to the authorities in Geneva, Rome, London, Berlin, etc., around Thursday or Friday next week. As for the final negotiations on the issue of equality in armaments, it must wait until British Foreign Minister Simon, French Foreign Minister Herriot, and German Foreign Minister Neurath come here to participate in the League of Nations Administrative Council before they can be held.</p>
<h3>Riots Occur on Armistice Day</h3>
<p>South Irish Republican Army Clashes with Police</p>
<p>Communists and Royalists Clash in Paris</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, November 11, Paris dispatch: Today, the 14th anniversary of the Armistice was held here with extremely grand ceremonies. All institutions, shops, and most civilian homes hung national flags to express celebration. The morning was foggy. Government personnel gathered in front of the Arc de Triomphe, and the onlookers on both sides were crowded. At around 11 o'clock, President Lebrun arrived by car, first shaking hands with the speakers of both houses of parliament and cabinet members, and then taking off his hat and walking to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to pay his respects. The tomb was filled with wreaths. After a minute of silence, General Giraud conducted the military parade. Participants included students from the École Polytechnique, the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, various army, navy, and colonial troops, and motorcycle teams. During the ceremony, several reserve officers held war-damaged military flags and joined the parade. After the event, they were returned to the Les Invalides for display. People who paid their respects to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier continued into the evening.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, November 11, Dublin dispatch: A major riot occurred here on Armistice Day. More than a thousand members of the Irish Republican Army marched through the streets, burning British flags, snatching poppies worn by passersby, singing "We will crown Valera as King of Ireland," and shouting "Dublin does not need to wear poppies!" (Note: This flower is a symbol of peace.) During the disturbance, many small shops were vandalized, and cars were overturned, with people dragged out and beaten. The authorities then ordered the mobilization of the security team, along with the police, to surround the disturbed area and carry out suppression. It is heard that after the melee, a total of twenty-six people were injured and sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, November 12, Dublin dispatch: Police stated that one person died and several were arrested during yesterday's riots. The demonstrators resisted for four hours. Finally, the police were forced to fire blank shots, and the crowd dispersed. At that time, several women and children were squeezed to the ground and trampled.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, November 11, Dublin dispatch: Several thousand members of the South Irish Republican Army gathered in Dublin today to march through the streets, causing disruption. The police then mobilized all personnel to prevent the Republican Army's march and dispersed their ranks with batons. The Republican Army then smashed the glass windows of shops displaying poppies with bricks. Precautions were particularly strict at night. The central area of Dublin was surrounded. Many people were injured and sent to the hospital, and several were arrested. General Mulcahy, a supporter of the opposition party Cosgrave, protested in parliament against the government's threat to execute Cosgrave and others. Valera replied that the government would use all its power to maintain the right to freely discuss public issues and would not allow individuals or private groups to perform functions belonging to the state.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, November 11, Paris dispatch: Today is the 14th anniversary of the Armistice. This afternoon, peace activists, socialists, communists, and royalists all gathered their followers to hold demonstrations in front of the statue of the famous socialist leader Jaurès at the Panthéon. First, the peace activists placed a "palm of glory" in front of the statue. When the socialists did the same, a conflict broke out between the communists and royalists, and the order was disrupted. The police dispersed them. The royalists regrouped and seven people were arrested. The communists then flocked to the city hall, which was farther away, intending to regroup there, but they were prevented due to the precautions. Other than that, nothing else happened.</p>
<h3>Turmoil in Geneva</h3>
<p>The 24-Hour General Strike Has Begun</p>
<p>National News Agency, November 12, Bern dispatch: The situation in Geneva has suddenly deteriorated. The turmoil on Wednesday may extend elsewhere. Yesterday, the Zurich public meeting passed a resolution supporting the Socialists and Communists of Geneva, and the Zurich Communists even announced a general strike. However, whether the workers will comply is not yet certain. The 24-hour general strike in Geneva today has begun. Except for the railroad and tram workers, all other workers have joined. The state's Third Infantry Regiment and 103rd Reserve Regiment have been dispatched by the authorities to the villages this morning to sound horns and drums to summon mobilization. However, the mobilization notices posted in the city were quickly torn down by the workers. The Vaud region, a French-speaking area of the state, has also dispatched an infantry regiment to garrison the Geneva train station, while the Lausanne authorities have dispatched the 8th Cavalry Regiment to garrison the Mouji area, where the Lausanne-Geneva railway line connects. These troops are all under the command of Colonel York. All opinions everywhere say that the situation in Switzerland has never been as dangerous as it is today. If a serious conflict occurs between the workers and soldiers in Geneva, it is feared that bloody riots will also erupt in other industrial centers.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, November 11, Geneva dispatch: The trade union committee notified the entire Geneva region that it would stage a 24-hour general strike tomorrow to protest the official handling of the Geneva disturbances this week. It has been investigated that twelve people died and about sixty were injured during the disturbances. The riots were caused by a conflict between the crowd and socialist leaders. The police were unable to stop it, so they mobilized troops to suppress it. However, the rioters attacked the army and seized their guns. Although the army retreated, they were still pursued by the rioters. The army then opened fire with machine guns on the crowd, causing several deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, November 12, Geneva dispatch: Since the Socialists wanted to petition the League of Nations for peace and disarmament, they were stopped by the police, which led to the major conflict on Wednesday. Today, the workers' groups have announced a general strike on Saturday for all private enterprises and Geneva tram workers, involving nearly 10,000 people. To prevent further disturbances, the authorities have ordered all troops and reserves to mobilize, and another cavalry regiment will be dispatched to Geneva tomorrow morning at 7:00 AM to strengthen the force. It is also heard that troops have been sent to patrol the streets of Lausanne, but no disturbances have occurred so far. The authorities anticipate that there will be some demonstrations when the general strike begins, so they are taking strict precautions and warning residents not to go out during the march.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, November 12, Geneva dispatch: The main committee of the Disarmament Conference met today under the protection of Swiss army machine gunners to discuss ways to make disarmament a reality. This strange situation is due to the Geneva trade union's announcement of a general strike today. The Swiss authorities have mobilized four infantry battalions and a reserve battalion to prevent further riots. Tunnels carrying machine guns are hidden in the gardens of the League of Nations headquarters to prevent demonstrations against the League of Nations. So far, the response to the general strike has been sparse. The trams are still running as usual, and there is very little panic on the streets except for the presence of troops.</p>
<h3>Netherlands Increases Tariffs</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, November 11, The Hague dispatch: It was learned today that the Dutch government will levy a 20% import tax on sugar to make up for the budget. Import taxes will also be levied on other goods, but limited to those that the Netherlands cannot produce.</p>
<h3>The Disaster in Cuba is Extremely Severe</h3>
<p>Twenty-Foot Waves Penetrate Inland</p>
<p>The Death Toll Exceeds Two Thousand Seven Hundred</p>
<p>National News Agency, November 11, Havana dispatch: After Cuba's southern coast suffered a catastrophic hurricane, the government announced today that the death toll has exceeded 1,500 and the number of injured is similar. Santa Clara Province reported 1,200 deaths, and all industries have stopped. Disaster reports from other places are still coming to Beijing, and it is feared that the total number of deaths and injuries will far exceed the aforementioned number. The government is organizing rescue teams to rush to the disaster area with medicine and food for emergency rescue.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, November 11, New York dispatch: A dispatch from Camagüey, Cuba, states that Santa Cruz was the epicenter of the hurricane. Dozens of injured people from that area have arrived here by car. At least a thousand people have died in the storm. According to the latest news, two hundred and sixty bodies have been buried in Santa Cruz, and hundreds more remain in the forests and rubble. About four hundred people have been injured. No houses there are intact. Sea waves twenty feet high were whipped up by the wind and penetrated fifteen miles inland, causing many deaths and injuries. The disaster victims who arrived in Camagüey described the disaster as extremely tragic, saying that the hurricane began at dawn on Wednesday, the tide surged over the dike and flooded the city, with a water depth of twenty-one feet. About seventy ships were lost in the storm. The storm in Jamaica was also severe, but the disaster situation is unknown due to the lack of telephone communication. The weather is now fine, and traffic is expected to resume soon.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, November 12, Camagüey, Cuba, dispatch: The death toll from the storm is currently estimated to be about 2,700. The worst-hit areas are the provinces of Santa Cruz del Sur and Guáimaro in eastern Camagüey, as well as Long Island and Rum Cay in the Bahamas. The city of Santa Cruz has become a wasteland. After urgently recruiting burial workers, they found hundreds of corpses and cremated them all to prevent the spread of epidemics. According to a telegram sent by the British ship "Frosvik," Camagüey Island was completely destroyed, with about sixty residents killed and hundreds injured. The New York "Journal of Commerce" estimates that the loss from this storm will reach as much as 5 million US dollars.</p>
<h3>The Bolivia-Paraguay War Continues</h3>

<h3>The Japanese Emperor Falls Ill During Military Review</h3>
<p>Reuters, November 12, Tokyo dispatch: According to the Imperial Household Ministry, the Japanese Emperor is currently reviewing troops in Osaka and has contracted a minor cold, which is not a cause for concern.</p>
<p>▲ Japan Allied News Agency, November 12, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Emperor was originally scheduled to oversee the army's large-scale exercise at the field headquarters today, but he decided to cancel the trip to the field due to a slight illness last night.</p>
<h3>The United States Budget Deficit</h3>
<p>Reaches Eight Hundred and Fifty Million</p>
<p>Tax Revenue Can Increase by Thirty Million After Repealing Prohibition</p>
<p>Reuters, November 12, Washington dispatch: It is estimated that the US budget deficit at the end of the current fiscal year will reach at least 850 million US dollars. Congress will have to implement a manufacturer's sales tax during the December session. Senator Reed stated today that the useless taxes under current law have failed to generate the necessary revenue.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, November 11, Washington dispatch: Before the Democrats take over both houses of Congress, Congress will hold one more session, lasting three months. It is expected that there will be some disputes between the political parties. The House of Representatives, with a small Democratic majority, and the Senate, with a Republican majority, must consider the ordinary annual expenditure bill, tax cuts, and the prohibition issue. There will be heated debates on these matters. More than a hundred congressmen have been defeated in this election, and they will no longer be members after the new government takes office in March next year. Therefore, they will undoubtedly deliberately engage in strange tricks in the next meeting. According to the Tax Commission, the government can increase its revenue by 300 million US dollars annually after taxing the sale of beer and light wine.</p>
<p>The World News Agency said that in the US election, the Democrats won, and the prohibition is likely to be relaxed. According to opponents of the US prohibition, there are great economic losses. The New York statistician Mr. Teledt has created a table of prohibition losses, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>219,000 lawbreakers caused by prohibition, 200,000 bootleggers, £92,000,000 annual cost of enforcing prohibition, £200,000,000 annual loss of federal revenue, £4,000,000 annual loss of state revenue, £4,600,000 annual loss of city revenue, 170,000 people imprisoned for prohibition violations, 700,000 people unemployed due to prohibition, 23% increase in mental illness caused by illegally produced spirits.</p>
<h3>Democratic Party Completely</h3>
<p>Controls U.S. Congress</p>
<p>Kuomintang News Agency, Washington, 11th—According to the results of the Senate and House of Representatives elections announced today, which can be considered final, the Democratic Party has achieved a great victory.

In addition, 17 states, while not entirely Democratic, have at least one member from that party. Furthermore, the five members of the Farmer-Labor Party were all elected from Minnesota. Although there are still some close vote counts that need to be recounted, it is not expected to affect the established outcome.

<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 12th—Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi Katsuji, departed from Tokyo Station at 9:00 PM last night, traveling to America via Siberia and Europe to resume his post. The ambassador told reporters who visited him in the train that he had the opportunity to engage in sincere discussions with the government and various sectors of the public during his home leave and had gained much. Since the Manchurian Incident, relations between Japan and the United States have gradually deteriorated. However, Japan and the United States have close economic ties and have maintained the most intimate relationship for over half a century in other aspects. He believes that they will soon return to a friendly state. Although his return home was short, he personally inspected the solid development of Manchuria and gained much. After returning to his post, he plans to explain the freedom of Manchuria's independence and the relationship between Japan and Manchuria in detail to American officials and civilians, and strive for their understanding. He believes that the United States will be able to understand Japan's just position. When he arrives in Geneva, he will meet with various representatives, report on his discussions with Foreign Minister Uchida, and discuss everything frankly. He plans to go to Washington via England in mid-December.</p>
<p>▲ Japan United News Agency, Tsuruga, 12th—Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi Katsuji, arrived here this morning at around 8:00 AM with his wife, daughter, and secretary Sugahara. They transferred to the Amakusa Maru to Vladivostok and will return to their post via Europe.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, Paris, 13th—Matsuoka Yosuke, a member of the Japanese Lower House, former Vice President of the South Manchuria Railway, and current chief Japanese representative to the League of Nations, arrived in Paris at 11:20 AM today. The Japanese Ambassador to France, Nagaoka, the Ambassador to Belgium, Sato, the Minister to Switzerland, Yada, the Director of the Japanese Secretariat of the League of Nations, Sawada, and the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in France all went to the Gare du Nord to greet him. Mr. Matsuoka, along with General Sato and Mr. Yosizawa, the former secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Berlin, stayed briefly in Berlin to meet with Mr. Ding Shiyuan, the representative of "Manchukuo" in Berlin, and to inquire of German Foreign Minister Neurath and discuss the Manchurian issue with him. He then went to Hamburg to visit the commercial port. When Matsuoka was in Berlin, he gave a speech to the German heavy industry newspaper "Daily Mann Report," stating that his trip to Moscow was of a private nature, but he had free talks with key Soviet Russian government officials in order to improve relations between Japan and Russia. Matsuoka also said that at this moment, Japanese public opinion is more favorable towards Soviet Russia and that he hopes the import of Japanese goods into Russia can continue to increase. He then spoke about the establishment of the "New Manchurian Nation," saying that Japan should take various measures to support it. When a reporter from the newspaper asked Matsuoka whether "Manchukuo" would grant Japan preferential tariff rates, Matsuoka replied that he did not know about "Manchukuo's" intention in this regard. He also stated that "Manchukuo" should grant equal rights to the powers in accordance with the open-door principle. Matsuoka did not confirm the rumor that "Manchukuo" would raise funds in Japan. As for the commercial situation in Manchuria, Matsuoka said that he was satisfied, and that the value of "Manchukuo" currency in Shanghai was higher than that of Chinese silver dollars. Speaking of the "Manchukuo" army, Matsuoka said that this army currently has 100,000 personnel and is being trained by a large number of Japanese instructors. As for Japan's attitude towards the Lytton Report, there is no need to mention it at this moment. He believes that if a country signs an agreement with another country and recognizes its independence, the League of Nations should not make any decisions or interfere.</p>
<h3>Mussolini Reviews Defense Forces</h3>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 11th—Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today reviewed a nine-regiment parade of the Rome defense forces as part of the celebrations for the Italian Emperor's birthday. Hundreds of carrier pigeons were released in the parade ground, first flying in a circle in the sky, and then flying away in formation. Italian Air Minister Balbo, who previously led many aircraft to South America, is scheduled to personally lead an air force on a round-trip flight across the Atlantic again next summer.</p>
<h3>Japanese Expand Market Through Illegitimate Means</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th—Recently, there have been repeated reports that Japanese people are using English trademarks and the names of British merchants to harm British trade. The Parliamentary Secretary of the Board of Trade, Mr. Runciman, also mentioned the Japanese infringement of human commerce during a debate on economic events in the House of Commons today. It is said that the Japanese only entered the British rubber shoe market last year, but within a year, Japan has become the largest supplier of this kind of commodity. The impact of Japan's active exports on world trade and the efforts of the Japanese to expand their market by adopting means that we consider unfair competition can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th—The House of Commons has approved an order to increase import tariffs on Japanese rubber shoes and other items. According to the original tariff, the tax was 20% ad valorem. From now on, rubber shoes will be subject to an additional tax of three to five pence per pair.</p>

<h3>Record of Fierce Battles by Righteous Armies</h3>
<p>Righteous Flags Everywhere in Southern Liaoning and Andong</p>
<p>Killing Sounds Resound in Liaoyang and Yixian</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Righteous armies in various parts of Northeast China have sprung up like mushrooms. Although they are in the midst of icy and snowy conditions, they continue to fight fiercely with the enemy. There are many tragic acts among them. Unfortunately, due to traffic obstruction and the lack of propaganda personnel, many have been buried. Here are a few reports of the righteous armies obtained from a certain source, which are unknown to people within the Pass. They are recorded below because the heroic act of fighting for the survival of the nation should not be erased.</p>
<p>Report from Cao Zhen, commander of the 30th Division of the Northeast People's National Salvation Army, and Wei Yuntai, deputy commander: 1. In September, they received military supplies such as bullets, sabers, and bombs in Tianjin. After all kinds of dangers and hardships, they safely transported them to their destination in southern Liaoning on September 24th. They immediately distributed them to various regiments and battalions to step up their work. They then received a secret order from Chief Supervisor Zhu Jiqing, instructing them on combat tactics. On October 2nd, they ordered Regiment Commander Wang Kuiyi to lead his unit to attack Gushan. They fought against the Japanese garrison and the local Datong team at Jiudaogou. The enemy had a total force of about 1,000 people, with five aircraft supporting them in the air. Our army, with 800 men, bravely fought the enemy in a bloody battle all day long. Our Regiment Commander Wang took the lead and bravely moved forward. Due to the enemy's fierce artillery fire, he was seriously injured. He still shouted to advance and kill the enemy. He died smiling for his country due to his serious injuries and lack of medical treatment. The army retreated to Huangtukang due to the loss of its commanding officer and sent a telegram requesting reinforcements. In this battle, more than 30 enemies were killed and many were injured. Our army suffered more than 20 officers and soldiers killed and 14 wounded due to enemy aircraft bombing. After receiving the report, Zhen and others immediately led their troops and the Big Sword Squad to reinforce and fought a major battle with the Japanese soldiers at Huangtukang. Japanese aircraft came to assist again. Our soldiers used water-cooled Maxim guns to shoot them down while lying down. The enemy was surrounded by us and broke through, retreating to Zhuanghe. This battle was fierce for up to eleven hours. More than 50 enemies were killed, 35 rifles, more than 2,000 bullets, two mule carts, and many military supplies were seized. Nine soldiers of our army were killed and 14 wounded. Nearby villages were bombed by Japanese aircraft, and the tragic situation was unbearable to witness. However, the people admired Chief Supervisor Zhu's determination to save the country, and although they suffered sacrifices, they had no complaints. The weather here is getting colder, and all officers and soldiers do not have cotton clothes or fur coats. In addition, nine out of ten households in the countryside are empty, and supplies are difficult to obtain. They urgently need considerable assistance. 2. Since the September 18th Incident, the local military and political power in Liaoning and Andong counties has been controlled by Li Shoushan, who was appointed by Japan as the overseas commander. He recruited bandits and ruffians and had two brigades of troops. Japan supplied them with guns, artillery, and ammunition. They were very well-equipped and repeatedly fought with the army, massacring our compatriots. It cannot be overstated. The Japanese Emperor commended Li for being able to kill Chinese people and specially awarded him a precious sword as encouragement. Li has become more powerful as he recognizes the enemy as his father. Last month (October) on the 20th, he personally led a mixed brigade, together with a Japanese garrison regiment, to Dagushan and attacked our army. Our side immediately sent Regiment Commander Xu Huchen to lead his entire regiment to resist. They fought fiercely at Qingduizi all day long. Both sides suffered casualties. Zhen led his troops to assist at dawn on the 21st, and the morale was greatly boosted. Li Shoushan's younger brother, Battalion Commander Li (Model Battalion, consisting of four infantry companies, one machine gun company, and one mortar company), was killed on the spot, along with more than 50 other officers and soldiers and more than 10 Japanese soldiers. More than 20 were injured, and 23 rifles, more than 50 mules and horses, and many bullets and military supplies were captured. The Japanese and their puppet troops immediately collapsed. Our army was pursuing, originally intending to wipe them out in one fell swoop, but Japanese aircraft arrived and bombed our army. In order to preserve our strength, we had to order a retreat, and temporarily stationed at □□gou □□gou. Because this place is a convenient route to Tongxiuman, the liaison between the Japanese and puppet troops in Zhuanghe and Xiuyan was cut off. Liu, the county magistrate of Xiuyan and commander of the militia regiment, sent a representative to contact our army on the 24th to implement a revolt. They were submitted to Chief Supervisor Zhu and appointed as commander of the 36th Route of the National Salvation Army. Deng Houmei, the county magistrate of Fengcheng, also led his troops west to cooperate with us. Even more people from nearby villages brought their guns to join us, no less than 100,000 people, and the military might was greatly boosted. Li led the remnants to retreat to Dagushan. Our army surrounded Dagushan in three routes on the 28th, waiting for them to run out of food and ammunition, and they would collapse on their own. It is expected that the elimination of Li will make it easier to recover the counties in southern Liaoning.</p>

<h3>Continued Important News</h3>
<p>Report from a special correspondent in the Liaoshen area □□□: 1. Nanyu District of Liaoyang was completely recovered by Zhang Huamin, commander of the 2nd Regiment of the Independent 5th Division of our army. The entire armed population of the five districts united to resist Japan. The strength and power of our army are growing stronger day by day. It is easy to attack and defend, relying on the mountains and rivers. The Japanese army is quite anxious. Ten days ago (mid-October), the Japanese sent more than 500 troops to attack, but they were surrounded by our army, and more than 20 enemies were killed, and seven vehicles of baggage were seized. The remnants fled in a panic and were surrounded by our friendly forces, and more than half were annihilated, with few surviving. 2. Since my work began, in addition to guiding the formation of various units to actively attack the enemy at any time, I have also sent many comrades to various places to carry out activities. Previously, Mr. □□□ used the name of an education inspector to go to the fourth and fifth districts to promote resistance against Japan, and then led more than 2,000 armed people to rise up against Japan. 3. Now, the righteous armies in the Liaoshen area have no place to hide because the green gauze curtains have fallen, and they are often bombed by Japanese aircraft. Except for a few who surrendered to the enemy due to environmental constraints, the majority regarded surrendering to the enemy as a great shame and contacted our army to cooperate. Although our army has a safe and solid base, it is difficult to obtain salaries and weapons, and we urgently hope that the headquarters will provide sufficient assistance. Gao Pengzhen, the second commander of the National Salvation Army, reported on the order of Zhu to lead troops to attack Yixian: 1. On September 29th, he led seven cavalry companies, departed from Heishan County □□. At 6:00 PM on the same day, he arrived at Beixiagouzi, Beizhen County (60 Chinese miles from the county seat) and camped. At dawn the next day, just as he was preparing to move forward, Dezi, Shuangshan, and Xinlai, leaders of the puppet Nationalist Corps of Beizhen, led more than 2,000 infantry militia to surround us. Fortunately, our army was prepared early and was able to respond calmly. After fierce fighting until noon, the enemy side killed a squad leader and 17 militiamen, and many were injured. Our side only injured three people and killed three horses. The enemy side deceived our isolated army and was trapped, and at 6:00 PM, they carried out a close-range encirclement. Peng saw that the time had come to dusk, and the opportunity could not be missed, so he selected strong and brave men with handguns to form a commando team, and separately sent the sixth company as a left flank to attack the Dashanzhu Village in the left front, and sent the seventh company as a right flank, and detoured to the enemy's rear to disrupt, in order to cover our army's safe retreat. At 10:00 PM, all retreated to Xiaonanshan to reorganize and rest. Three of our soldiers were injured and one horse was killed. The number of enemy deaths and injuries is unknown. At 12:00 PM, they marched towards Laoye Ridge. At 8:00 AM on October 1st, they arrived at Minjia Dianzi (the village originally had the Fa Zi unit of the People's National Salvation Army). They rested at Xiaobaitun, a few miles away from the village. At 9:20, Shan, the director of the Beizhen Puppet Public Security Bureau, led 500 public security teams, two field guns, and received orders from the Japanese army to attack from the left rear. Because our cavalry had difficulty fighting in the mountains, all of them immediately retreated to Minjia Dianzi, occupied the position, and confronted the enemy. The Fa Zi unit of the National Salvation Army in the village also had 200 people and 35 Big Sword Squads who joined the battle, and the morale was boosted. About half an hour later, our army occupied Xiaobaitun and killed a puppet public security director, a puppet battalion commander, and two squadron leaders in the Dayuan of West Street, and killed 25 public security teams. The exact number of injured is unknown. Our Big Sword Squad seized 15 large and small guns and one cannon (which was damaged). At 3:00 PM, the Japanese army used aircraft to bomb from the air and snatched the corpses. The enemy did not escape until it was dark. Our army was exhausted after repeated battles and rested temporarily. At 5:00 AM on the 2nd, according to intelligence, the Japanese army ordered Hu Laohuan (Hu Ni Zeng sent his own daughter to marry a Japanese officer) to lead 2,000 Luhuahui to attack from Zhengnanshan. Our army immediately selected 350 commando troops, together with 2,000 Fa Zi troops and 35 Big Sword Squads, to launch a fierce attack and occupy Nanshan. Taking advantage of the victory, they pursued for 50 miles, to the north of Goubangzi for more than ten miles. The remnants were supported by the Japanese army, and our army retreated back to Minjia Dianzi. In this battle, 13 enemies were killed and the injured are unknown. One of our men died, one gun was lost, and one horse was lost. At 5:00 AM on the 4th, according to espionage, the Japanese army sent two companies from Goubangzi, one company from Beizhen, one aircraft, two cannons, 15 cars, two tank cars, and the entire county public security team to surround us, blocking the mountain passes. Peng then led the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 7th companies to retreat to the Yijieshimenzizi. The 1st, 2nd, and 6th companies were surrounded by the Japanese army and trapped in the valley. Three assaults were unsuccessful. In this battle, 19 enemy officers and soldiers were killed and one gun was obtained. Eighteen of our men were killed, 39 were injured, 31 guns were lost, and 161 horses were killed. Our army was hit hard, and ammunition and supplies were exhausted. The future is still unknown. They had no choice but to reorganize the team and detour to the back of Heishan that night at 8:00 PM, etc. (November 10th)</p>

<h3>Guizhou Army's Joint Suppression of Communist Bandits in Suichuan</h3>
<p>Li Zhenqiu Reports on Bandit Suppression Situation Upon Returning to Guizhou</p>
<p>Southern Jiangxi is Peaceful, Only Anyuan Still Has Bandit Traces</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Southern Jiangxi Defense Army has recently stepped up its guard on the Southern Jiangxi defense line, because the eastern and western Guizhou have simultaneously launched a large-scale crackdown on communists. Yu Hanmou, the commander of the 1st Army of Guizhou, has dispatched the Zhao Lian unit of the 1st Training Regiment of the army to be responsible for guerrilla warfare in the Nankang area to clear out the remaining bandits in the area and to facilitate timely information from the front. He ordered the Ganzhou Camp to plan to set up relay posts in the counties of Ganzhou, Nankang, Shangyou, Chongyi, and Xinfeng. Once the budget is approved, it can be established. Li Zhenqiu, the commander of the 1st Division of the 1st Army stationed in Jiangxi, returned to Guizhou by plane on the 4th. It is said that the whereabouts of the communist bandits in Jiangxi Province are elusive, and the main force is unknown. Our army has no choice but to take a step-by-step approach and respond to the situation as it arises. The bandits who recently disturbed Suichuan were the remnants of Lin Biao's bandit gang in Dawangdong. Because the Dawangdong bandit's nest was broken by our army last month, Lin Biao's bandits scattered to Zuoyingqian. For strategic reasons, our army did not send troops to pursue, so the remnants of Lin Biao continued to gather in Tanggang Suichuan and united with the Xintang local communists, gathering more than 5,000 people and about 2,000 guns, and attacked the Central Army's 28th Division stationed in Suichuan County. At that time, only a small part of the 28th Division was stationed in the city, and due to the disparity in numbers, they were forced to withdraw. Later, when our army heard the news, they sent ten battalions of troops to Shangyou and assisted in the suppression of bandits in Xintang. The Zhou Division of the Central Army also attacked from Wanan and finally defeated the Suichuan bandit. The bandits fled in two routes, one route fled back to Xintang along the original route, and the other route dispersed to eastern Hunan. Suichuan is still guarded by the Central Army, and there are no more bandit traces in the vicinity. As for the area below Ganzhou, our army has set up defenses at every point and formed a mutual defense with the troops stationed in Sannan. The Sannan area is currently stationed by the 4th Division of the 2nd Army and the Wang Division of the Guizhou Army. Local communists have been cleared out from Xinfeng to Longnan, but in Anyuan, there are still several thousand Red Guards belonging to the bandits, who appear from time to time. However, this unit is not the main force of the Red Bandits, and its combat effectiveness is weak and not enough to worry about. (November 7th)</p>

The Long-Distance Bus Company is responsible for the repairs, and the expenses are deducted from the road maintenance donation. During the road repair period, long-distance buses reduced the number of runs, and ordinary cars were all suspended. Small car companies believe that their livelihood has been cut off and have repeatedly requested a change of plan, but to no avail. Therefore, they continued to operate.

<h3>Hangzhou Municipal Government Prevents</h3>
<p>Japanese Students from Visiting the Mainland</p>
<p>Shirai Ko, the Japanese Consul stationed in Hangzhou, stated that students from the Dongwen College were scheduled to come to Hangzhou this month and visit Ningbo, Shaoxing, and other places. Yesterday, he specifically met with Zhao Zhiyou, the Mayor of Hangzhou, to request protection. Zhao replied that the government could be responsible for protection within the scope of Hangzhou. However, most of the areas along the way to Ningbo, Shaoxing, and other places were rural areas.

The Japanese Consul repeatedly requested that the Municipal Government specifically describe the contact situation at that time and submit it to the Provincial Government for review.

<h3>The Reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Arrival of Orders in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The General Manager's Office Completes Preparations</p>
<p>The New General Manager to Take Office Tomorrow</p>
<p>Consideration of Stock Value Requested by Li</p>
<p>Explanation of Wharf Loan Procedures</p>
<p>Since the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) was discussed and decided upon separately by the Central Political Council and the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications yesterday issued an order to the Supervisory Office, instructing it to order General Manager Li Guojie to hand over his duties.  It also ordered General Manager Liu Hongsheng to take office immediately, and notified the directors and supervisors to perform their duties.  General Manager Li has completed the handover, and the new General Manager is scheduled to take office tomorrow.  Regarding the wharf loan mortgage case, the staff firmly opposed it, and General Manager Li specially published the details of the process.  The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' Order Arrives in Shanghai: New General Manager Liu Hongsheng, Standing Director Ye Zhuotang, Director Hu Bijang, and Supervisor Lu Xuepu, etc., formally received the appointment order from the Ministry of Communications yesterday.  Supervisor Chen Fumu also received instructions from the Ministry of Communications yesterday to hand over his duties one by one.  He then forwarded the order to General Manager Li Guojie to comply with.  The original order is recorded as follows: Order to Comply with Instructions.  It is hereby ordered that the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau has been discussed and decided separately by the Central Political Conference and the Executive Yuan, and the Executive Yuan has presented a request to the National Government to appoint Ye Zhuotang, etc., as Standing Directors, Hu Bijang, etc., as Directors, Lu Xuepu, etc., as Supervisors, and Liu Hongsheng as General Manager. The Ministry hereby orders the said General Manager Liu Hongsheng to proceed to the Bureau to take office immediately and notify the Directors and Supervisors to convene a meeting to perform their duties. In addition to informing the said Manager, the Ministry also forwards the information to the former General Manager of the Bureau, Li Guojie, to acknowledge and handle accordingly, and to report separately. It is appropriate to order you to comply with this order and hand over your duties one by one. We hereby order the said General Manager to immediately comply with this order and hand over your duties.</p>
<p>▲ Completion of Handling in Compliance with Orders. After Supervisor Chen Fumu of the Supervisory Office submitted his resignation, he was immediately ordered to complete the handover and prepare to hand over his duties. All kinds of documents have been compiled with numbers and completed. General Manager Li Guojie of the General Manager's Office, after the Executive Yuan's meeting resolved to reorganize, immediately instructed the heads of the Secretariat and the General Affairs, Business, Shipping, Wharf Affairs, Accounting, and Commercial departments to be responsible for handling the handover separately in order to prepare for the transfer. The various departments have been rushing to complete this work for several days, and it is expected to be completed within a few days. In the future, the functions and powers of the Supervisory Office will be replaced by the Board of Supervisors in accordance with the resolution of the Executive Yuan, and the Supervisory Office will naturally be abolished.</p>
<p>▲ Liu Dingming to Take Office. New General Manager Liu Hongsheng received instructions from the Ministry of Communications yesterday morning, ordering him to go to the China Merchants Bureau to take office immediately. Today is Sunday. According to sources from the Bureau yesterday, Liu Dingming will come to the Bureau to take office on the 14th.</p>
<p>▲ Minister Zhu's Attitude. After the Central Government decided to nationalize the China Merchants Bureau, the Bureau's General Manager Li Guojie secretly mortgaged the Bureau's four wharves to the American-owned China General Edison Company for debt, and signed a contract to implement the takeover the day before yesterday. The Ministry of Communications received a telegram that day and immediately dispatched Gao Tingzi, Director of the Navigation Administration Department, to fly to Shanghai to investigate the truth. He returned to Beijing by night train that evening to report to Minister Zhu and request instructions on how to deal with the matter. Zhu Jiahua stated, "This matter is of utmost importance to national sovereignty. The Ministry had no prior knowledge of Li Guojie's mortgaging of the Bureau's assets to foreign merchants for a huge amount of money. It was only after the contract was signed the day before yesterday that we received a telegram from General Manager Liu Hongsheng. We immediately dispatched Gao Tingzi, Director of the Navigation Administration Department, to fly to Shanghai to investigate. He brought back the contract for the mortgage signed by both parties to Beijing this morning (the 12th). It is currently under thorough study. The amount of the loan reached more than 20 million. General Manager Li's reasons are nothing more than to repay various urgent debts and to circulate funds. However, since the Central Government has resolved to nationalize the China Merchants Bureau, it should await instructions. It is suspected of exceeding his authority to sign a loan to foreigners without authorization. How to deal with this in the future will be discussed after reviewing the contract. In short, national sovereignty will not be allowed to be abandoned in the slightest." Gao Tingzi also stated, "I was ordered by the Ministry to fly to Shanghai to investigate the loan matter of the China Merchants Bureau. After arriving in Shanghai, I met General Manager Li Guojie and obtained the signed contract and a large number of other documents related to this case. Although Li made some explanations for handling this matter, it is inevitable that people will find it puzzling that he did not report to the Ministry for instructions beforehand. While in Shanghai, I also consulted the new General Manager Liu Hongsheng and the directors about their opinions on this case and remedial and follow-up measures. This morning, I personally presented the original text of the contract to Minister Zhu and requested instructions on how to deal with it. Due to foreign relations, it cannot be published. However, the Ministry of Communications will handle it impartially due to the issue of jurisdiction. There will be a strict disposition of this case." It is also heard that Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua telegraphed Han yesterday to report to Jiang and Song and request instructions on how to deal with the matter. A reply has not yet been received. Also, Li only sent Secretary Yang with the contract he signed and a written explanation to the Ministry on the evening of the 11th. It is said that the original case is very long. The Ministry of Communications is currently studying the content of the contract. Since this matter has been formally signed, there is a legal basis. Although we intend to cancel it, we are afraid that the foreign merchants will not agree. After research, it is planned to negotiate with the company. The Ministry of Communications will handle this case on the principle of not losing sovereignty. It is also heard that Zhu Jiahua plans to go to Shanghai on the evening of the 13th to personally investigate the truth and meet with the new General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, Liu Hongsheng, to discuss everything.</p>
<p>▲ Li Guojie's Telegram to the Ministry. Li Guojie, Chairman and General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, telegraphed to Song, President of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, and Zhu, Minister of Communications, "Respectfully to the attention of Song, President of the Executive Yuan, and Zhu, Minister of Communications: Reports state that the China Merchants Bureau was resolved by the Central Political Council on the 9th to be nationalized, and all stocks will be returned to shareholders at the market price of 50 taels per set. While the government is indeed showing consideration for the difficulties of merchants, the shareholders still suffer significant losses. An investigation reveals that the total assets of the China Merchants Bureau and its accumulated property company are estimated to be worth 50 to 60 million taels at current prices. After deducting more than 17 million to repay debts, there remains 30 to 40 million. If the company were to be dissolved and liquidated, each set of shares would be worth more than 1,000 taels. Now, only 5% of the value is being used to nationalize the shipping assets and the real estate unrelated to the shipping industry that has been analyzed and reorganized into a separate company. Not only are the shareholders unable to legally enjoy the profits that have been generated and grown over the past 60 years, but even the initial investment of capital is being lost by more than half. This does not seem to be the intention of our wise government to treat merchants with fairness and generosity. Based on the regulations on supervising privately-owned public utility enterprises promulgated by the government and passed by the Legislative Yuan, the nationalization, the counting of the amount of assets of private enterprises, and the evaluation and recovery of assets are all clearly stated in the laws, which are visible to all at home and abroad and are jointly respected. How can we only use the current low price of buying and selling stocks by one or two shareholders as the standard? Moreover, the rise and fall of stock prices are uncertain, while the amount of asset value is fixed. If we abandon the fundamentals and only pursue the superficial, it will inevitably make domestic industrialists hesitate. Especially for the accumulated property company unrelated to the shipping industry, it should be handled separately. Because I have been heavily entrusted by the shareholders and the matter concerns the interests of the entire body, I dare not remain silent. I humbly request that you adopt this suggestion, reconsider it, and I am extremely grateful and moved. Furthermore, I have heard that a capable person has been selected for the position of General Manager. Please instruct him to come to the Bureau as soon as possible to take over, so that I can be relieved of my heavy burden. I respectfully submit this combined telegram. Li Guojie, Chairman and General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau."</p>
<p>▲ Explanation of Wharf Loan. The loans recommended by Li Guojie to the Supervisory Office before taking office included three types: one was a construction loan, the second was a wharf loan, and the third was a purchase of new ships on credit. The one that has been implemented by signing a contract is the wharf loan. The explanation of the wharf loan is recorded as follows: The wharf loan is to re-borrow and mortgage the wharves of the five new wharves of Central, Northern, China and Southern China owned by the China Merchants Bureau, which had already been mortgaged to the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, to the American-owned China General Edison Company. The company will issue bonds with a total face value of 10 million Shanghai taels, which will be used to repay the old HSBC debt and redeem the mortgaged properties in various ports at home and abroad, in order to create a new plan for activities. The points that need to be explained for this loan are: ㈠ The urgency of the HSBC debt and the concern of bankruptcy. The largest creditor of the China Merchants Bureau is the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, with a debt of 5 million taels of principal, plus interest, donations and taxes paid on its behalf over the years, totaling approximately 2 million taels, for a total of more than 7 million taels. The mortgages are the five wharf of Central, North, China, South (i.e. Jin Liyuan) and New (i.e. Yangjiadu) in this port, and the real estate in Hankou, Tianjin, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Shantou, Qianjiang Wuhu, Jiujiang, Shashi, Yichang and other foreign ports. According to the valuation made by Tongli Foreign Firm four years ago, the above-mentioned mortgages are worth about 20 million taels of silver. However, a loan of less than a quarter of the value has caused such valuable property to be completely mortgaged and unable to be used, which is a pity. In recent years, the bank has expressed dissatisfaction with the excessive arrears of interest. According to the original contract, the bank demanded repayment of principal and interest, and the momentum was strong. Last year, former Commissioner Guo also promised to repay it at the end of the year, but was unable to do so. Therefore, the urging was even more urgent. Although the Board of Directors has made every effort to respond, it has fortunately not broken down. However, how can it be possible to get away with empty words for a long time? If we do not take this opportunity to quickly raise a huge sum of money to repay the bank and redeem all the mortgaged properties to get rid of this disaster and find another way out, in case of a breakdown, and the bank disposes of the mortgaged properties everywhere, other creditors will inevitably follow suit. Then, in the midst of the Chu song on all sides, it will be impossible for the China Merchants Bureau to avoid bankruptcy. ㈡ The only main reason for the sluggish business. The reason why the debts of the China Merchants Bureau have become increasingly heavy is purely due to the sluggish business. The only tools that the business relies on are ships and warehouses and wharves. However, the Bureau only has 25 ships left, and most of them are too old to be used. The warehouses and wharves are also old and dilapidated, and have lost their production capacity, resulting in more expenditure and less income. The shortfall is all made up by borrowing money, so it loses money every year and incurs more debt every year. The debt platform is getting higher and higher, and the life is becoming increasingly difficult. Therefore, if we do not urgently seek to add ships and actively repair the warehouses and wharves to revitalize the business and increase revenue, then those who rely on borrowing money to live will inevitably die from the suffering of the debt burden. This can be said with certainty. ㈢ The negotiation and conditions of the loan. The negotiation of this loan began in the winter of last year, after Guojie and former Commissioner Guo agreed on the overall plan. Then, in connection with the aforementioned construction loan, negotiations were started with the American-owned China General Edison Company. After the company fully accepted it, it went on to discuss the conditions. The China General Edison Company will provide the Bureau with a loan of up to 10 million Shanghai taels, with the wharves and real estate of the five Central, Northern, China and Southern wharves under the jurisdiction of the China Merchants Bureau as collateral. The term is 20 years and the interest rate is 9% per annum. However, because this kind of huge loan is beyond the company's ability to bear, it is allowed to issue bonds worth 10 million taels in its own name or in the name of the designated person. In order to encourage bondholders to sell easily in view of the current tight world financial situation, it was agreed by both parties that the actual amount of this loan must be received at a discount of 85%. The company is responsible for whether the bonds can be sold and how to pay interest and repay principal, which has nothing to do with the Bureau. In addition, the interest of 9% is initially considered to be slightly heavy, but since the Shanghai War, the money market has not eased. According to the past lending practices, the HSBC debt interest rate was already 8% ten years ago, and the Citibank interest rate was even 8.5%. Moreover, before the wharves and warehouses are completed, the income is limited, and the interest is not enough for the company to pay for us every year. Therefore, the number of 9% is still not considered to be a heavy interest under the current market situation. Even the 2.5% commission it demanded is also a customary practice in fact and cannot be admitted without pain. The above-mentioned loan is used to repay all the HSBC mortgages, the interest payable, and the various donations and taxes paid on its behalf, totaling approximately 7 million taels. In addition, the old debts that should be cleared for the wharf, such as the debts owed to the Siming Bank and Sandetang, totaled approximately 100,000 taels. In addition, 250,000 taels will be paid to the commission that should be paid for this loan. The first half of the plan for this loan is to repay the debt, redeem the mortgaged properties, and its conditions are as follows. ㈣ The lease and transfer of the wharf. In the above-mentioned conditions, the China Merchants Bureau, except for reserving the Southern Wharf (i.e. Jin Liyuan Wharf) for its own use and the New Wharf (i.e. Yangjiadu Wharf) for its own operation, the China General Edison Company will lease all of the Central, Northern and China three wharves from the date of signing this loan. The annual rent is stipulated to be a total of 300,000 Shanghai taels for a period of 20 years. After the expiration date, the lessee is willing to continue to continue for another 10 years. The Central, Northern and China three wharves are used to promote foreign shipping and have nothing to do with domestic shipping. In peacetime, they only solicit foreign ship business. Over the years, the annual income is only more than 200,000 taels in addition to expenses. If the rent that should be obtained by leasing to others is measured, not only is there no pure profit to be said, but also tens of thousands of taels are still collected less every year. Now, the Central, Northern and China three wharves have a guaranteed rent of 300,000 taels per year without any effort on our part. All the donations and taxes currently and in the future levied on the leased wharf by the Shanghai Municipal Council or the Chinese government are the responsibility of the lessee to pay. The amount saved every year is not small, and the New Wharf is still reserved for its own operation. The total income is higher than before, and it can be guaranteed. It is also agreed that the lessee may sub-lease or transfer it to a third party at the same rent, but the term shall not exceed the final due date stipulated in these conditions. This third party is the Dalae Shipping Company, which was previously jointly accepted by the Bureau for this loan. Because the Bureau's previous lease term was too long, although the rent was not short, it was still not very cost-effective when the property price and interest were compared. Therefore, it was agreed with the Dalae Company to jointly establish a Central, Northern and China three wharves company with the Bureau to operate the ship mooring and cargo piling business, and to regain half of the business rights of the wharf, etc. The second half of the plan for this mortgage to protect property and develop business and its conditions are as follows. ㈤ The right to jointly establish a wharf company. After the China General Edison Company agrees to transfer the three leased wharves to the Dalae Shipping Company, it will be used to jointly establish a wharf company with the Bureau. Both parties will each invest 1 million taels of capital. The company is also willing to raise debts and provide advances for this capital required by our side. All the conditions shall be in accordance with the bond method of this loan. It is difficult for the Bureau to raise this huge capital separately, and it has regained half of the business rights of the three wharves. The Dalae Shipping Company is very large in scale and has dozens of ocean-going vessels that regularly travel to Europe, America, Japan, and Southeast Asia. The Bureau's original business customers, coupled with the ocean-going vessels that regularly berth at Dalae, are the basis. The interest on wharf rentals and cargo handling will naturally not be less, and Dalae can also solicit other Southeast Asian shipping business. The surplus profit is divided equally in half. Compared with completely self-operation, the degree of development cannot be counted by kilometers. Moreover, there is a guaranteed rent of 300,000 yuan per year. Although the term is longer, the profit is also larger. In any case, the Bureau will definitely not suffer a loss. ㈥ Preparation for paying principal and interest. In order to prepare to pay the interest on this mortgage and to plan to have funds every year in order to pay the money into the debt repayment reserve account, the following income is designated for its use: ㈠ The annual rent of the Central, Northern and China three wharves, ㈡ The wharf rentals that the Southern and New wharves should pay on schedule. ㈢ 25% of the net profit from the shipping business in the future. The above income will first be used to pay the interest on this mortgage. If there is a surplus in the total amount of income, it will be included in the reserve account for the China Merchants Bureau to repay the debt for future payment of the principal. This accumulated reserve fund will be managed by the China General Edison Company and must be devised to generate the maximum possible interest. However, if the China Merchants Bureau has a good strategy that can make the interest generate generous returns, it is suggested that the company adopt it. This generated interest will also be included in the debt repayment reserve account and shall not be used for other purposes. ㈦ All related benefits. In summary, the main purpose of this loan is to raise a sum of money to repay the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in order to avoid the danger of bankruptcy. The related benefits are: ㈠ To repay the old debts of the Siming Bank and Sandetang, ㈡ To redeem the real estate in various ports, which can be used as collateral for the purchase of new ships on credit, ㈢ The Central, Northern and China three wharves can be leased at the same time, with a guaranteed annual rent income, ㈣ The Southern and New wharves can still be used and operated by ourselves without any restrictions, ㈤ To borrow other people's capital to build and add various houses on the Central, Northern and China three wharves and the rest of the wharf land, ㈥ To jointly establish a wharf company, develop the business, and receive half of its rights, and to borrow other people's capital to raise this capital for us. It is a good opportunity to prepare for several good things at once. Therefore, Guojie believes that this kind of good opportunity should not be missed, lest the China Merchants Bureau fall into a state of poverty and sit and wait to die.</p>
<p>▲ Chen Supervisor's Report. Regarding this loan plan, Li Guojie reported to Chen Fumu, Supervisor of the Bureau, last month. We can understand its content by reading it. The original report stated, "For the matter of reporting, I, Guojie, previously submitted a report on the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau's loan situation, attaching copies of the construction loan contract with the Shanghai Bund Fuzhou Road area, the mortgage contract, the Shanghai Central, Northern, China, New and Southern five wharves loan contract, the mortgage contract, the Shanghai Central, Northern and China three wharves lease contract, and the memorandum on purchasing ships on credit, requesting your approval. I received instructions stating, "The report and various mortgage contracts, loan contracts, leases and explanatory documents have been received. An investigation reveals that the China Merchants Bureau's debts are accumulating, and the ships and warehouses are dilapidated, resulting in a decline in business and a monthly deficit of more than 100,000. If we do not plan to thoroughly improve it as soon as possible, it will become bankrupt. According to the report, the agreements with the American-owned China General Edison Company and the Dalae Shipping Company, such as the construction loan in the Shanghai Bund Fuzhou Road area, the Shanghai Central, Northern, China, New and Southern five wharves mortgage loan, the Shanghai Central, Northern and China three wharves lease contract, and the memorandum on purchasing ships on credit, have been repeatedly discussed by former Commissioner Guo Waifeng and the General Manager. Now, the various contracts and articles have been reviewed by this office and are still feasible. In accordance with the provisions of the regulations, they should be approved for record. The General Manager should separately sign the above-mentioned contracts with the American merchants, etc. In addition to using the borrowed funds to repay the accumulated debts, the remainder should be designated for construction and production, so as to enable the stagnant situation to be revived and avoid wasting the funds and increasing the debts. You should comply with this order." I, Guojie, complied and contacted the American-owned China General Edison Company, and formally signed the above-mentioned construction loan contract, the mortgage contract, the wharf lease contract, and the memorandum on purchasing ships on credit on September 5th and 6th this year. However, the Yi Company stated that the signing of the above-mentioned contracts was approved by the Supervisor, and the Supervisor should affix the official seal to complete the legal procedures. I hereby attach the original and duplicate copies of the various contracts, mortgage contracts, and memorandums that have been signed, and request your approval to affix the official seal and return them for separate possession. Furthermore, according to the China General Edison Company, the issuance of bonds for the above-mentioned loans still requires a considerable period of preparation. Before the arrangement is in place, both parties should temporarily keep it secret, etc. I hereby report this combined information and request your examination. Respectfully presented by Chen, Vice Minister of Communications and Supervisor of the China Merchants Bureau, and Li Guojie, General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau. (Huadong News Agency)"</p>
<p>▲ Secretary-General Zeng's Talk. Yesterday, a reporter visited the Secretariat of the Bureau's Supervisory Office, and according to Hui Huaiwen, the loan reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau was planned by Guo Waifeng when he was in office. The loan from the American-owned China General Edison Company was 10 million taels for a construction loan and 10 million taels for a wharf loan. In addition, because the American-owned China General Edison Company and the Dalae Shipping Company are related, Dalae will purchase new ships from abroad on credit. It is planned to purchase 30 ships, each with a deadweight of 10,000 tons. This will also cost about 10 million taels. The loan will be used as the China Merchants Bureau's debt. The mortgages are the existing ships and wharves in this port and other ports. It is estimated that it can be repaid in 20 years. As for ㈠ the 10 million taels for the construction loan, the China General Edison Company will not deliver actual funds. The company will issue public bonds to renovate the buildings of the China Merchants Bureau. Because the Bureau's real estate currently only earns 200,000 yuan per year, if a 13-story building is renovated, at least 1 million yuan of rent can be earned per year. ㈡ The wharf loan will be used to reorganize the wharf, and all the old and scattered mortgages will be redeemed at the same time. After the China General Edison Company takes over, it will only have the right to supervise, manage, design and reform. If the business develops and various payments are received every day, the company will be responsible for the safekeeping. Because Dalae has a loan relationship, all Dalae's incoming and outgoing vessels will rely on the wharves of the China Merchants Bureau, and an annual rent of 300,000 taels will be subsidized. In the future, a wharf company will be established to be solely responsible. ㈢ The purchase of new ships on credit is because the China Merchants Bureau's vessels are old and were purchased 30 or 40 years ago. Not only is the tonnage small, but it is also very dangerous to sail at sea. This method is indeed needed now. The wharf dispute was indeed unclear beforehand. Therefore, after the representative came to the Bureau, it was resolved. However, the shareholders believe that the previous face value of the shares was 100 taels, but the Ministry of Communications ordered the shares to be repurchased at 50 taels, which they feel is too much of a loss and there is a slight problem. The Supervisory Office will be abolished after the establishment of the Board of Supervisors, etc. (Guowen News Agency)</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Contract Content. Although the loan contract signed between the China Merchants Bureau and the China General Edison Company is for 30 million taels, the preliminary agreement for building houses for 1,000 taels was signed in September this year. The official contract was signed by Li after he took office and Sadeley, the General Manager of the China General Edison Company. The loan will be distributed to the China Merchants Bureau by issuing public bonds at 85% of the actual amount. The China General Edison Company is responsible for everything. 4 million taels will be issued first for the following purposes: A. To repay the 1 million taels loan and interest that was previously mortgaged at Citibank. B. To repay the 470,000 taels loan and interest that was previously mortgaged at the China General Edison Company. C. To pay the Bureau 500,000 taels to meet the needs of business. D. To pay the construction costs of building the newest office building at the corner of Sichuan Road and Fuzhou Road. E. To pay the China General Edison Company the 2.5% commission that should be obtained according to the face value of the first batch of bonds issued for the mortgage loan. (Guowen News Agency)</p>
<p>▲ Observation of the Four Wharf Manager's Office. After Ling Jingshan submitted his resignation to General Manager Li of the General Management Office of the China Merchants Bureau on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, he handed over his affairs to Deputy Section Chief Hong Dezhao as an agent. Li Guojie approved Ling's leave for 15 days because Ling refused to hand over his affairs to the China General Edison Company but had handed over his affairs, and appointed Hong Dezhao to succeed Ling. At the same time, the China General Edison Company sent Zhong Ketuo to the Four Wharf Manager's Office to jointly take charge. Yesterday was the birthday of General Sun Yat-sen. The office was ordered by the General Management Office to close for one day and still hung the national flag to commemorate the event.</p>

<p>▲ Wharf Workers Petition. The Five Wharf Workers' Union decided on three measures at a joint meeting of all group leaders regarding the wharf mortgage matter. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., a council meeting was held, presided over by Yu Xianting, who reported on the process. Then, the discussion began, and the resolutions of the joint meeting of group leaders were unanimously passed. It was decided that tomorrow at 10:00 a.m., all matters would be handled by Yu Xianting, Xue Yinkui, Shi Tiezhang, Zhang Guiqing, Cheng Changsheng, etc., together with all group leaders Xia Zhende, Wang Xingcun, Lin Sheng, Xue Xingbiao, Zhao Zule, etc., to petition the General Bureau. ㈠ Oppose the mortgage as the highest principle and protect livelihood as the minimum. ㈡ Expedite the case of the salary arrears in October. (Xinsheng News Agency)</p>
<p>▲ General Bureau Workers Oppose. Regarding the wharf mortgage, the General Bureau Workers' Union, in addition to sending a letter to the General Manager stating its firm opposition, also sent a telegram stating, "Respectfully to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, all levels of Party Headquarters, all organs, all organizations, and all newspaper offices: Recently, a Westerner suddenly came to take over the Central, Northern, and China three wharves of this Bureau. We learned that the three wharves' properties and business management have been transferred to foreign merchants. The colleagues are extremely shocked. The China Merchants Bureau is the only remaining transportation enterprise in our country. Now that the government has determined to actually take it over and run it as a national enterprise, we are looking forward to proper rectification and daily prosperity. The Central, Northern, and China three wharves are the only business tool of this Bureau. The several wharves in Shanghai have long been coveted by foreign merchants. The Chinese people are unable to wait to protect and support them, how can we bear to abandon them like worn-out shoes and hand them over? In this reorganization of a storm-tossed and precarious situation, there is suddenly a move to transfer the three wharves to foreign merchants. Such a blatant sacrifice of shipping tools is a loss of sovereignty and humiliation. The colleagues and the China Merchants Bureau share weal and woe and are closely related. What we feel is dangerous, and we cannot remain silent. We vow not to recognize this illegal act. In addition to stating our firm opposition to the Supervisor and General Manager of this Bureau, we also hope that all compatriots in the country will unite to support us in saving the nation's shipping industry, we are most fortunate. Respectfully, the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation General Bureau Workers' Union. (Xinsheng News Agency)"</p>
<h3>The Second Day of the Chinese Children's Education Society Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>丨Discussing Health Education and Elementary School Textbook Issues丨</p>
<p>Holding a Ceremony to Celebrate the Birthday of the Premier</p>
<p>The third annual meeting of the Chinese Children's Education Society continued at Nanzhong Elementary School on the morning of the 12th at about 9 o'clock. Because that day was the Premier's birthday, Chairman Ma Ketan and Master of Ceremonies Tian Shuren held a ceremony to celebrate the Premier's birthday. Ma Ketan then spoke about the greatness of the Premier's life and career, followed by an introduction of Dr. Jiang Benkuan, who lectured on the state of mental health in the United States.</p>
<p>▲ Details of Proposal Discussions</p>
<p>Ma Ketan then reported on the formal discussion of the proposals. Cha Shouhong and He Erchao took records. First, they reported that some organizations were planning to join the society through introductions. However, individual members only needed approval from two executive committees, while group members required approval from the general assembly. The names of the schools were then put forward, including the Veterans' School, Jiangsu Provincial Women's Normal School, Fujian Jimei Experimental Rural Normal School, and Fujian Provincial Fuzhou Elementary School, all of which were approved one by one. The report then stated that the proposals had been sorted into five categories: ㈠ Health Education, ㈡ Curriculum, Teaching Materials, and Textbook Research, ㈢ Children's Publications, ㈣ Society Affairs, ㈤ Other. The first category was then discussed: ㈠ Proposal to formulate specific standards for health performance evaluation. (The method: ㈠ Health knowledge and skills 40%, ㈡ Health habits 40%, ㈢ Physical fitness 5%, ㈣ Diseases 5%, ㈤ Overall evaluation of other academic performance 5%, ㈥ Practical ability 5%.) Chen Jianheng said that in addition to health, sociology should also be included. Some advocated that, in addition to this, attention should also be paid to sports, hygiene, safety, etc. Some said that special attention should be paid to health habits and that schools should be designated for experimentation. Some said that there are many issues related to health education and that a permanent health education committee should be organized to focus on research. It was then resolved to organize a health education committee to review and research the proposal. As for the organizational methods, given the situation of the executive committee, they would be planned and organized by the executive committee. Opinions expressed during the daytime session would be submitted to the established committee for reference. ㈡ Proposal on what method should be adopted for editing health teaching materials for senior elementary schools (the proposer reported examples: ㈠ Central question, ㈡ Small questions, ㈢ Summary, ㈣ Homework, ㈤ Habit formation, ㈥ Formal testing, ㈦ Diagnostic testing.) Some advocated submitting it to a committee for research, while others advocated free experimentation by each school. It was resolved to submit it to the Health Education Committee for research. ㈢ Proposal on standardizing children's education. Xue Tianhan and others proposed that the society should urgently standardize the normal weight standards for children that are more applicable nationwide or in various provinces and regions and that the proposals should be discussed together. With the consent of the public, it was jointly resolved to submit them to the Health Education Committee for review and research. ㈣ Proposal to compile the materials displayed at the Health Education Achievement Exhibition into an annual report. Li Qingsong and Chen Heqin advocated entrusting the Beijing Municipal Annual Report Team to handle it, which was resolved by entrusting it to the Annual Report Team. Xia Chengfeng said that this year's products are so beautiful that it may be difficult to select them in the future. Xue Tianhan said that the established selection objectives should be divided into several categories, and the best should be selected from the same achievements. Shi Renfu, Li Qingsong, and Luo Tingguang, etc., all expressed opinions on how the exhibition should be jointly organized as a reference. The second category is curriculum, teaching material, and textbook research: ㈠ Current elementary school textbook proposal (the method: the first step is for the society to investigate the elementary school textbooks adopted by group members this year and the subjects they voluntarily experiment with and research; the second step is for the society to formulate experimental record forms and distribute them to group members and allocate experimental textbooks; the third step is for the results of experimental research to be submitted to the society two months before the next general meeting; the fourth step is for the society to collect a majority of opinions and submit them to the next annual meeting for discussion and sorting; the fifth step is to publish the discussions and sorting in the monthly magazine (and suggest them to the Ministry of Education for reference in compiling textbooks). Wu Yan and Chen Heqin advocated a textbook research committee. Jiang Xicen advocated making corrections to textbooks as teaching materials, because textbooks have a small scope and teaching materials have a larger scope. Xue Tianhan seconded the motion. It was then resolved to organize an elementary school teaching material research committee. Li Qingsong proposed that the executive committee hire an organization, and everyone agreed without objection. It was past noon, and due to a visit to the mausoleum at 1 pm, it was decided to continue the meeting at 9 am on the 13th.</p>
<p>▲ Afternoon Visits and Socializing</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to primary and secondary schools in this city yesterday, stating that extracurricular activities for students in various schools are very important. The central plan for this year is health education, so extracurricular activities should also focus on health education. In addition, national crisis and labor should be used as supplements.

<h3>Education Department Commissioners Inspect Jiangnan College</h3>
<p>Since Jiangnan College was approved by the Ministry of Education, Chairman Ye Kaixin and President Li Zuo have been determined to rectify it. The students in the law, political science, and economics departments this year are particularly developed. The Ministry of Education has now specially hired commissioners Yi Guanmao, Shi Shangkuan, and Guo XinSong, who arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday and are scheduled to inspect the school the day before tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Pays Attention to Film Education</h3>
<p>The acting superintendent of education of the Shanghai Municipal Council suggested that the council subsidize the International Educational Film Company with silver two thousand taels so that the films it produces can be shown for free in the schools established by the council. The Education Committee discussed that educational films are very beneficial, but the methods are not yet known. It should wait for the representative of the company to return to Shanghai before discussing it again. Also, there are still old film projectors in the schools established by the council. If they can be sold, it is planned to sell them immediately.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Normal School is Full</h3>
<p>The Acting Superintendent of Education of the Shanghai Municipal Council recently reported to the Education Committee that the Normal School has admitted 60 students, including 35 external students, who have paid a total of 520 yuan in tuition. Because the number of students has increased, four additional lecturers have been hired. School has been open for two weeks and it is not planned to accept new students. A committee member suggested that students who have graduated and are specializing in English should be required to pay additional tuition. After deliberation, the chairman proposed that the increase in students this year is largely due to the announcement of the news. The increase in fees should be discussed after the outside world has determined this need. This proposal was approved by the public. Also, the work of the department should be paid attention to by the teachers of various Western children's schools.</p>
<h3>Wusong Tongji University Expands Campus</h3>
<p>Since Wusong was devastated by the violent Japanese, most of the school buildings were destroyed by ruthless artillery shells.

After the Medical College of National Central University was changed to Shanghai National Medical College, it was decided to move to a new site on Haig Road for operation. The remaining Wusong campus was decided to be transferred to Tongji University for the expansion of its affiliated middle school. It is heard that President Weng Zhilong and President Yan Fuqing negotiated back and forth several times to form a transfer contract. It is reported that the formal handover will take place on the 17th of this month. Tongji has now hired workers to bid for the renovation, and the construction will be completed this year. The affiliated middle school will then move in.</p>
<h3>Jinda Chrysanthemum Exhibition - Day One</h3>
<p>Thousands of Guests Yesterday, Continuing Today</p>
<p>Also Holding an Exhibition of Japanese Army Relics</p>
<p>Jinru Jie Li Jinan University held a chrysanthemum exhibition yesterday, starting on the Premier's birthday, for two consecutive days. The reporter drove there yesterday afternoon and saw that the three public buses running between Shanghai and Jinru were full of passengers going to visit the school. Inquiring with the school's signatory staff, it was said that there were a total of two or three thousand guests that day. Everyone regards the school as the only overseas Chinese university in China. This Shanghai incident was just the headquarters of our heroic 19th Route Army stationed to resist the violent Japanese, and then the Japanese army was stationed for four months, and the site was severely damaged. Therefore, they took this opportunity to take a look. The school gate had a white cloth banner hanging high, "Post-War Chrysanthemum Conference." The Science Museum and Zhiyuan Hall, two major buildings, stood on a vast plain of grass. It was late autumn, and the grass had turned goose yellow, and the shadows of the sun and shadows were very lovely. Following the sign, we proceeded to the Hongnian Library Chrysanthemum Exhibition. The museum was surrounded by flowers and trees, in good order, as if it were not after a robbery. Outside the museum, the roads were lined with plane trees, and there was a small stream. The wind blew the falling leaves, which was quite poetic.</p>
<p>The venue was guarded by boy scouts. From the entrance to the signing place, after signing, the reception staff gave each person a chrysanthemum special issue and a chrysanthemum cultivation method. There were more than a dozen pots of large chrysanthemums on the road, all of rare varieties. Then, we entered the eastern exhibition room. At first glance, it was like entering a country of fragrance. There were three major rows in total. Although the number of pots was less than that of the Municipal Agricultural Field, the room was densely packed. Among them, varieties such as Longyan, White Jade Belt, Xueqing Maoci, and Bai were valuable. The main building of the East Room displayed the school's library club works, as well as the works of Xie Gongzhan, a well-known chrysanthemum artist from China. Xie is a painting professor. In addition, there are Shen Weisou and other books collected by Long Zhengsheng, director of the Chinese Language Department of the school, as well as true manuscripts of famous artists from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. In the West Room, there are dozens of Han monument tree books recently unearthed, as well as photographs of Ming artifacts, which are not easily seen outside. On the long table in the north, there were also wooden clogs, monk's robes, blood canvas beds used by the National Rescue Team, pictures sent by Japanese elementary school students to encourage the Japanese army to fight, and hand-slipped bombs dug out of the school ditch, which were reminiscent of the horrors of the Shanghai war at that time. On the west side, there were many photos of the school being damaged, with the title (A View of Jinan After the War). Comparing the various destroyed and messy situations in the film with the currently repaired ones, we cannot help but feel indignant at the astonishing destructive power of the war.</p>
<p>The school's girls' dormitory was also open for two days at the same time. Many female guests visited. According to the person in charge of the school, tomorrow there will be additions of calligraphy and painting by celebrities and stone inscriptions collected by a professor.</p>

<h3>Chinese Open Race Walking</h3>
<p>Starting at 8 am this morning at the Intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road</p>
<p>Women's Race Held at 11 am at the Chinese Athletic Field</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Open 13-mile race walk, which caused a sensation for a while, started at 8 am this morning at the intersection of Carter Road and Jing'an Temple Road, with Father Laos Road Chinese Athletic Field as the finish line. At the same time, an unprecedented 1-mile women's race walk was held on the track and field track. In order to maintain order at the venue, the authorities sold admission tickets at a uniform price of two cents each to show restrictions.</p>
<p>It is also reported that athletes will enter the venue through the west gate, and visitors and leading members will enter the venue through the east gate.</p>
<p>The Race Walking Association pays great attention to maintaining order throughout the course and in the athletic field. In addition to sending letters to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Xiangfa Patrol Station to send special police officers and patrol officers to the area under their jurisdiction at that time, the Shanghai Boy Scout Council was also asked to send more male and female boy scouts to assist in everything. It is heard that the council has designated Guangyi Shangzhong, Guanghua, Moore Hall, Fudan, Wuyu, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Huizhong, Liangjiang, Youth Association, Guanggong, Yucai, Yousheng, Female China, and  Industry, a total of 1,000 male and female boy scouts, to be directed by Wang Gang, Leng Xueqiao, Qu Yue, Zhao Weizu, Yu Kuiyuan, etc. to maintain order.</p>
<h3>The Second Interport Football Trial Today</h3>
<p>3 PM at Recreation Ground</p>
<p>The Shanghai Western Football Association will hold its second interport trial at the Recreation Ground at 3 pm today. The association is divided into two teams, white and mixed, and the configuration is quite flawed. The most obvious is that Li Feng and the others should join forces. In short, under today's circumstances, the association should select a formal team and form another mixed team to play against each other. It seems to be a better plan to have more games and increase cooperation. Also, if the weather is not good today, you can call 443333 between 10 am and 12 pm to inquire.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Opening of the Ancient Artifacts Museum at Baosheng Temple in Jiaozhi</h3>
<p>A large crowd attended the opening ceremony yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Three people tragically drowned in a boat capsizing accident between Suzhou and Kunshan.</p>
<p>The Ancient Artifacts Museum at Baosheng Temple in Jiaozhi Town, under the jurisdiction of Kunshan and Wu Counties in Jiangsu Province, was planned and constructed by the Committee for the Preservation of Tang Sculptures in Jiaozhi of the Ministry of Education. The project took three years to complete and finally opened yesterday. Many people from Beijing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and other places attended the opening ceremony, creating a grand spectacle. However, a small passenger boat carrying passengers from Suzhou to Jiaozhi capsized en route. Three passengers tragically drowned, which is truly unfortunate. Details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Grand Opening Scene</p>
<p>Attendees at yesterday's ceremony included Central Committee member Cai Yuanpei and his wife, former Minister of Railways Ye Gongchuo, Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Gu Zhutong's representative Dong Xiu, Jiangsu Provincial Finance Director Shu Shiwen, Central Research Institute Vice President Yang Xingfo, Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee members, Jiangsu Higher Court President Lin Biao, Kunshan County Magistrate Cheng Ruji, and about 500 guests from various locations. Those traveling from Shanghai took the 7:00 AM express train from the North Station to Kunshan, then boarded a special boat prepared by the Ancient Artifacts Museum Board of Directors at the Zhengyang Bridge Liutong Steamboat Wharf for Jiaozhi, arriving at 11:30 AM. Those traveling from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Suzhou boarded a special boat prepared by the association at the Guangji Bridge pier outside the Changmen Gate in Suzhou at 7:00 AM, heading to Jiaozhi. Along the way, water patrol teams had patrol boats stationed along the Wusong River, and the Public Security Bureau's police patrol team had sentries stationed on land for patrol and security. The opening ceremony was held at noon, with the following program: (1) Opening the door, (2) Opening the meeting, (3) All stand at attention and bow three times to the Party flag, the national flag, and the portrait of the Premier, (4) Silent tribute, (5) Chairman's speech, (6) Report on the process, (7) Guest speeches, (8) Photography, (9) Adjournment. Chairman Cai Yuanpei rang the bell to open the meeting. The crowd gathered at the gate of Baosheng Temple, and the national flag was raised. Mrs. Zhou, Cai Yuanpei's wife, performed the opening ceremony, inserting the key into the lock, unlocking the door, and the crowd entered the temple to begin the meeting.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Cai Yuanpei delivered a speech, saying:</p>
<p>"Today is the opening day of the Ancient Artifacts Museum at Baosheng Temple in Jiaozhi. I am very grateful for the presence of local officials and guests from all walks of life. Today is the Premier's birthday. In his lectures on nationalism, the Premier strongly stated that we have the ability to restore our national heritage. This ability lies not only in scientific inventions and applications but also in artistic creation and documentation. Holding the completion of this Ancient Artifacts Museum on the Premier's birthday signifies that we are doing our part to restore our inherent capabilities, which is a meaningful act. Statues are a unique art form in our country. Among the ancient works that survive to this day, the Song Dynasty Arhat statues in Lingyan, Shandong, and the Yuan Dynasty Buddhist and Taoist statues sculpted by Liu Lan in Beiping are the most famous. However, Tang statues are still lacking. (I do not know if there are any surviving objects in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, or Shandong). The discovery of the Tang Dynasty Arhat statues in Baosheng Temple in Jiaozhi shocked the art world in our country. According to legend, Baosheng Temple was founded during the Xiao Liang Dynasty, but its origins are difficult to trace. The sculptures on the walls and the eighteen Arhats are detailed in the records as sculpted by Yang Huizhi of the Tang Dynasty. Huizhi was originally a painter who was as famous as Wu Daozi during the Tang Dynasty. Because he did not want to compete with Wu, he turned to sculpture. Whether the sculptures in Baosheng Temple were actually created by Yang Huizhi is not definitively proven outside of historical records. However, the Kunshan Zhi (Kunshan Gazetteer) details the fact that Yang Huizhi sculpted statues at Huiju Temple in Yufeng, so it is possible that Baosheng Temple, which is not far away, was also sculpted by Huizhi. Mr. Gu Jiegang first noticed these statues, announced them to the public, and aroused the interest of people at home and abroad. I once proposed to raise funds for their preservation but did not implement it in time, and the main hall was destroyed. Of the sculptures on the walls, those on the east, west, and north sides, only the east side remains. Including the Arhat statues that had been dismantled and stored, only nine remain. Concerned that all would be destroyed, my colleagues reported to Mr. Cai Zimin, taking photos (Li Zunyong, photographer)</p>
<p>and agreed on a plan to properly preserve them. A new building should be built to cover the relics, the old fragments should be mounted on the new walls, and the Arhat statues should also be installed. When I was in charge of the University Council, I proposed allocating 10,000 yuan for this purpose. Subsequently, the provincial government agreed to allocate 3,000 yuan, and philanthropists raised more than 10,000 yuan. The Ministry of Education formed a committee to oversee the project, and Yuanpei, Ye Gongchuo, Chen Qubing, Ma Xulun, Chen Wanli, Chen Jianxiu, and Jin Jiafeng were elected as standing committee members. After three years of operation, it has finally been completed today. This is indeed a matter of celebration for the art and archeological community in our country. Not only can the works of famous Tang Dynasty masters be extended in life, but also the true image of the art of that time can be seen, and the interest and clues of research can be aroused. In this era, this must be regarded as a small contribution. Moreover, Baosheng Temple is a famous ancient temple, and the architecture of its main hall was confirmed to be from the Song Dynasty. Unfortunately, it has collapsed. Now, we can only collect its old materials and put together two dougong brackets to preserve its form. We have also tried our best to collect the ancient objects in the temple for reference. Any imperfections are hoped to be pointed out. Jiaozhi is located in a remote rural area, and we are particularly ashamed of our inadequate hospitality to the guests. We hope you will forgive us."</p>
<p>▲ Ye's Report</p>
<p>Next, Ye Gongchuo reported on the restoration process, briefly stating that the restoration of the Tang Dynasty sculptures at Baosheng Temple began in November of the 18th year and has taken three years. The progress seemed rather slow because construction could not be carried out in the winter. Furthermore, this spring, Zhu Tianle died tragically in a boat accident.</p>
<p>Restoration was also halted for several months due to the war. Various tasks could not be carried out simultaneously. For example, sculpture walls could not be installed during the construction of the walls, and sculpture installation could not be arranged before the house was painted. Furthermore, those in charge could not be stationed here permanently, and the project could not fully meet the pre-determined requirements. Often, dismantling and rebuilding were required, or photos were sent to Shanghai to determine what to do. Therefore, it has taken until today to complete. The progress should be briefly reported as follows: (1) The construction project fully complied with the decisions of the Standing Committee. The wall behind the sculptures was entirely built with cement to ensure solidity. The museum door was changed to iron. Two flower beds were built in the courtyard to display iron bells and Tang Dynasty sutra pillars, and stone roads were paved around the perimeter, which was an increase from the original plan but did not exceed the budget. The contractor was Yao Xinji, who had built the mausoleum for Sun Yat-sen. This spring, part of the project remained unfinished, and he did not want to continue. Therefore, engineer Shi Jiagan introduced another construction company to complete the project. The payment for labor and materials was 2,000 yuan, but only 1,100 yuan was paid, with the remainder being a donation, which is deeply appreciated. (2) The sculpture repair section was the responsibility of architects Jiang Xiao'e and Hua Tianyou. The Arhats originally sculpted by Yang Huizhi were arranged on three sides of the main hall. After the hall collapsed, they were surrounded by walls. The first step was to carefully dismantle and move the enclosure walls and sculpture walls, which took more than twenty days. After the three-section clay wall was built in the back, it was found that the sculptures were old and loose, making it difficult to install them firmly. After several discussions, iron feet were installed on the wall. The original sculpture wall was badly damaged, and Mr. Jiang Xiao'e repaired it, restoring the shape and color to their original state. Of the original eighteen Arhat statues, only two were perfect and undamaged, and four were incomplete. In order to preserve the true appearance of ancient art, they were not repaired. The arrangement of the nine Arhats and the configuration of the sculpture wall were based on old photographs. (3) Economically, the Ministry of Education allocated 10,000 yuan, the Jiangsu Provincial Government allocated 3,000 yuan, and donations totaled more than 10,160 yuan, plus more than 500 yuan in interest, for a total income of more than 23,700 yuan. In terms of expenses, engineers Fan Wenzhao and Shi Jiagan, sculptors Jiang Xiao'e and Hua Tianyou, and accounting director Jin Zongcheng all performed their duties free of charge, and I also managed the paperwork. Therefore, although the administrative expenses lasted for three years, they were less than 1,000 yuan. The rest was used for construction costs of 14,500 yuan, sculpture repair costs of nearly 4,000 yuan, and other items of about 5,000 yuan. The two offsets are still less than 1,400 yuan. (4) Jin Gang Hall in front of the museum has now been verified by archeologists, part of which is Song and Yuan Dynasty architecture. It is also of great value for preservation. There must be many other ancient artifacts of Baosheng Temple that have been lost, and attention should be paid to collecting them. I hope everyone will actively contribute to see the completion soon, etc. Finally, speeches were given by Dong Gejia, Director of the Construction Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Director of the Ancient Artifacts Museum, and Yuan Ying, Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association. Photos were taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>▲ A Glimpse of the Ancient Artifacts</p>
<p>The Ancient Artifacts Museum is located on the original site of the main hall of Baosheng Temple, west of Jiaozhi Town. The new building has three bays and is surrounded by a low wall. Inside the museum, the front is the nine Arhats sculpted by Yang and the repaired sculpture wall. Next to it are the remnants of the beams, ridges, dragon heads, and owl horns of the original temple's main hall, as well as an ancient stone tablet. In the right front corner against the wall stands a tablet with an inscription by Cai Yuanpei and calligraphy by Ma Xulun, recording the preservation of the Tang sculptures. There are two flower beds in the courtyard, an ancient bell in the east, and a Tang Dynasty stone sutra pillar in the west. In front of it is the Jin Gang Hall, which is on the verge of collapse. There is a large Buddha statue in the middle, which is dilapidated. To the right of the temple is the gate to Duck Pond, where Mr. Lu Guimeng studied. He was also buried here after his death.</p>
<p>▲ Boat Capsizing Incident</p>
<p>During yesterday's opening ceremony, one thing was quite unfortunate. At about 11:00 AM, the Yuanxing, a boat carrying passengers from Suzhou to Jiaozhi, suddenly capsized midway. The Yuanxing was a small diesel boat with a total of fourteen people on board, including four water patrol team members, Suzhou writer Zhu Liangren and his son Shilong, Shanghai News Agency special reporter Fu Ziwen, and reporters from Suzhou and other places. The Yuanxing, Zhizhong, and other three boats were connected by a cable in a straight line. The Yuanxing was in the middle. At that time, the three boats were moving forward. The front wheel was too fast, and the rear wheel was slower. When turning, the cable suddenly turned sideways, and the Yuanxing capsized immediately. At that time, the wind was piercing, and the boat windows were closed, causing the Zhu family and Fu to drown. Others were rescued by patrol boats and sent to Suzhou for treatment. Zhu used to teach at Dongda and other schools and was 68 years old. His son, Shilong, is currently a teacher at the Cheng Lie Physical Education School in Suzhou. Fu had just returned to Suzhou the day before, representing Suzhou archeologist Jin Songcen to Jiaozhi. Unexpectedly, he also tragically drowned yesterday.</p>
<p>According to Suzhou news, there was a special boat from Suzhou to attend the Tang Dynasty Sculpture Opening Ceremony in Jiaozhi yesterday. The ships were Yuanxing, Xinxin, and Zhizhong steamboats from the Third District of the Water Public Security Bureau, and Anjing patrol ship. The Yuanxing, Xinxin and Zhizhong three steamboats were connected with fierce ropes, running in a line. Xinxin was in the front, Yuanxing was the second, and Zhizhong was at the end. When sailing, because Anjing's speed was very fast, and the three steamboats were lagging far behind, so they also opened up the speed. When they arrived at San Shuang Banqiao, fourteen miles away from Jiaozhi, because the river port there was narrow, and there was a stone bridge, when turning, the central Yuanxing steamboat suddenly capsized due to front and rear squeezing. There were fourteen passengers on board, all of them fell into the water. Those who drowned on the spot were Zhu Liangren and Zhu Tianlu fathers and son (Zhu Tianlu, 30 years old, Suzhou people, now the director of Cheng Lie Physical Education School, ) and Fu Ziwen from No. 11, Xizhi Jialong, Yangyu Lane. All the others were rescued with only minor injuries. Now the dead and the passengers who fell into the river have been transported back to Suzhou by Zhizhong steamboat, and the injured in the water included Suzhou reporters Xia Youwen, Hong Xiaohong, Lv Lv, and Feng Qiunong, a cadre of the County Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>▲ Yang Huizhi Examination</p>
<p>Yang Huizhi, the sculptor of the Baosheng Temple statues, was from the Kaiyuan period of the Tang Dynasty. He studied painting with Wu Daozi, Liang Zhang Sengyao, and Hua Fa. Later, Yang focused on sculpture and made rapid progress. His work and Wu Daozi's painting were equally important at the time. There was a saying at the time that "Daozi's painting and Huizhi's sculpture capture the divine brushstrokes of Sengyao." Yang's works were numerous. According to records, there is the Jade Emperor statue in the Taihua Temple in Changle Township, Jingzhao, the Buddha statue in the Jingshi Courtyard of Anle Temple in Haozhou, the Thousand Buddhas, the door gods behind the three gates of the Eastern Sutra Library, the Vimalakirti statue in the hall, the five hundred Arhats on the three gates of Guangai Temple in Luoyang, and Mount Lengjia in Shangaoyuan, all of which are extremely miraculous. During the Huang Chao Rebellion, all the temples in Jingluo were burned to the ground without exception. Only Yang's sculptures survived. In addition, the sculpture wall of Fuyan Temple on Mount Lishan in Linzi County, Shaanxi, and the Bishamonten statue and the two attendant girls of Huiju Temple in Kunshan are also works of Yang. In Jingzhao, Yang was said to have sculpted a statue for the actor Liubei Pavilion. After the statue was completed, it was placed against a wall in the street. People on the road, seeing its back, thought that Liubei Pavilion was traveling and competed to exchange greetings. The statue's divinity is conceivable.</p>
<h3>Merchants and Residents of Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>Re-inspecting Inferior Goods</p>
<p>Permanently Eliminating Economic Ties</p>
<p>Certificates for Not Buying or Selling Inferior Goods to be Issued Today</p>
<p>The member stores of the Nanjing Road Business Association and the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association are all located in the Nanjing Road area. Nanjing Road is the center of the city and is watched by both Chinese and foreigners. All stores should conscientiously save the country and strive to resist inferior goods to be a model for the city. Therefore, many stores have voluntarily filled out written pledges to never buy or sell inferior goods and requested joint certification from the two associations to ensure and demonstrate sincerity. It is now reported that the two associations have prepared the certification plaques. However, to be cautious, the former members of the Goods Inspection Committee set off in three groups at 9:00 AM yesterday to conduct a fair and thorough inspection. Specialists from various industries were also invited to assist in each group. The results confirmed that all stores had indeed eliminated inferior goods.

<h3>Strong Winds at Songkou Hinder Navigation</h3>
<p>Ningbo-bound Vessel Returns to Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the 11th, a hurricane occurred in Little Luzon, moving north, affecting the South China Sea area. Many sea vessels were hit by the wind. The Taikoo Company's New Beijing vessel, heading to Ningbo on Friday, sailed out of Wusong on the same day. When it reached the sea area of Daqishan, the wind became stronger, and the navigation was dangerous. In order to ensure the safety of the voyage, the shipowner temporarily suspended the voyage. Then, because the wind was not calming down, it was decided to return to Shanghai. It arrived at Wusong at about 10:00 PM that night. Because it was late at night, it could not enter the port and was changed to Shanghai yesterday morning. All passengers on board were refunded their tickets and disembarked. The vessel is scheduled to depart on Monday.</p>
<p>▲ Wind Heading North</p>
<p>According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday, there is still a hurricane east of Little Luzon, heading north. It has reached the vicinity of Shandong.

<h3>Shanghai University Bus and</h3>
<p>Tram Collide in Tragic Accident</p>
<p>Bus Driver Driving Too Fast</p>
<p>Tram Speed Also Too Fast</p>
<p>Worker Thrown to Death After Collision</p>
<p>Four Students Injured</p>
<p>Shanghai University Bus Smashed to Pieces</p>
<p>Yesterday at 9:45 AM, a bus and a tram collided at the intersection of Yangshupu and Shengs Road, causing casualties. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Two Vehicles Collide</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Premier's Memorial Day, and all schools in the city were closed. Shanghai University of Shanghai also closed as usual. Therefore, a group of students at the school took the school's own No. 16114 bus at about 9:00 AM to go out. Because the driver saw that this place was quiet, he drove at full speed. When it reached the intersection of Broadway and Huasheng Road near the Ewo factory, the driver still did not slow down. At this time, a No. 73, 8th Route tram from the 16th Pu to Yangshupu was speeding from west to east. The bus driver originally thought of crossing over, but when he saw that the tram was too late, he quickly turned the car. At the same time, the tram driver braked seeing the car coming out sideways, and was also too late to brake. Therefore, the tram crashed into the bus.</p>
<p>▲ Worker Dies Tragically</p>
<p>With a loud bang, the bus was smashed to pieces, and the windows of the tram were shattered. A worker-like person standing on the front platform of the tram could not dodge when the two vehicles collided and was thrown out of the vehicle. His abdomen was broken, and his intestines flowed out. He died on the spot. The students in the bus were seriously injured when the vehicle overturned. They were groaning in the car. Fortunately, the workers and residents of the nearby Ewo Company and other factories heard the alarm and rushed to the scene of the accident to rescue the injured from the vehicle. At the same time, they reported to the police.</p>
<p>▲ Condition of the Injured</p>
<p>The police notified the Yangshupu Fire Brigade to send an ambulance. On one hand, Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched to rush to the scene and send the injured to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The body of a worker who had died by the road was also sent to the Forensic Examination Office on Filun Road for examination. Then, the dimensions of the intersection where the accident occurred were surveyed. On one hand, the destroyed bus was transported away, and the blood stains on the ground were washed away. The tram driver was immediately taken to the police station for questioning. All passengers on the tram, except for Wen Xichang and Cheng Wenda, whose hands and feet were seriously injured and were hospitalized, were slightly injured, so they were discharged from the hospital after being bandaged by the hospital. The students in the bus who were sent to Tongren Hospital due to injuries were Dai Jiaju, Zhu Dezhou, Li Haichun, and Xu Huandi. Among them, Dai and Zhu were slightly injured and were discharged from the hospital. The other two are still under treatment. The police are investigating the family members of the worker-like person to identify them.</p>
<p>According to Shanghai University news, at 9:00 AM yesterday, several students from Shanghai University of Shanghai asked for leave to take the public bus prepared by a private individual in the school to the city. The car arrived in Yangshupu. On the way, the vehicles were crowded and suddenly collided with a 9-way tram. Four students, Li Ruchun, Xu Huandi, Lu Zhongyu, and Chen Qi, were injured and sent to Tongren Hospital. At that time, the school was holding a memorial week. The school's President Liu heard the news and went to the hospital with Dean Fan and Chen Qishan, director of the high school, to visit. It was heard that the injuries of the injured were not very serious.</p>
<h3>The City is Preparing to Build Grain Storage Warehouses</h3>
<p>Allocating the Remaining Funds from the Former Shangbao Grain Storage Funds</p>
<p>Ordering Bean and Rice Businesses to Prepay 5% Donation</p>
<p>The City Government to Provide Funding for the Deficit</p>
<p>In view of the fact that this year's grain harvest is abundant and grain prices have fallen drastically, which has had a significant impact on the rural economy, and in response to the recent central government order to promote the construction of grain storage warehouses in the city, the City Government, in order to realize the city's warehouse plan and relieve grain prices, first formulated a grain storage warehouse plan by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and submitted it to the City Government. The City Government approved it separately and ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to comply with it. The situation and methods of the old Shangbao county grain storage funds are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Historical Overview</p>
<p>According to the investigation, the existing funds and assets of the two counties of Shangbao were used up by He Fenglin during the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Qi Lu war in the Republic of China. Therefore, despite the proposal for warehousing, it has not been implemented due to the lack of funds. During the summer and autumn of the 18th and 19th years, rice prices in the city soared, causing extreme panic. Although the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, together with local people, handled Ping Tiao as an emergency measure, it had little effect because the city had no grain storage. Therefore, in November of the 19th year, a fundraising committee was formed for the city's warehousing fund to raise one million yuan of warehousing funds in order to seek a fundamental plan for regulating the people's food. However, fundraising was difficult, and it is still less than 50,000 yuan. During the serious floods in the autumn of last year, in order to prevent the city from becoming unprepared, the Fundraising Committee for the Warehousing Fund petitioned the City Government to order 50,000 bags of foreign rice. However, after the order, due to the sudden outbreak of the incident in the three northeastern provinces, the exchange rate with the British exchange rate lost about 4 yuan, with a loss of 200,000 yuan. In addition to the 50,000 taels that have been paid and another 50,000 yuan offset, the city government has re-filled more than 70,000 yuan, (which is a donation) and still lost 63,442 taels and 4 cents. After the war, the city's finances are no longer what they used to be, but the city government agreed to pay 25,000 taels to settle the outstanding case. There is still a loss of 38,000 taels. 13,400 taels of which are the responsibility of the Warehousing Fund Committee, Gu Xin, to solicit donations from the rice industry. Still missing 25,000 taels, there is no way to make up for it, but at present the foreign rice is full, and the harvest is everywhere, and the rice price continues to plummet, so the city government in order to take emergency measures, will divide the funds from the Liangxian grain accumulation, the city should get 300,000 yuan, and the first year the bean rice industry voluntarily donate to fill in 300,000 yuan as a fund, by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau together with the land finance bureau to build grain storage warehouses,</p>
<p>▲ Current Methods</p>
<p>The city's grain storage construction method has been approved by the city government, and the Social Affairs Bureau is ordered to handle the following: (1) The Bureau, together with the Land and Finance Bureaus, shall quickly find a way to divide the old grain storage funds of the two counties of Shangbao and hand over the amount that the city should receive, about 300,000 yuan, to the city government for the construction of a new-style warehouse capable of holding 500,000 shi (about one month's grain supply for the city's population. If the 30,000 yuan is not enough, the city government will make up for it.) (2) The Bureau shall quickly discuss with the Bean and Rice Industry and other trade associations to formulate a specific plan for the industry to voluntarily donate a warehouse fund of 5 cents of silver per shi and submit it to the city government for approval. (3) The aforementioned donation fund of 300,000 yuan in the first year shall be raised by the industry first so that the first batch of 37,500 shi of indica rice can be purchased immediately (valued at 8 yuan per shi). (4) For the purchase of the aforementioned rice and grain, the city government may negotiate with the silver and money industry to borrow 600,000 yuan to 1 million yuan in cash so that it can continue to purchase and store it. In this way, the equipment warehouse and the purchase and storage of grain will proceed simultaneously, and there will be no difficulty in the city's economic situation.</p>
<h3>French Concession Local Bully Secretly Selling National Territory</h3>
<p>Purchased by Toa Dobun Shoin</p>
<p>Hua Dong News reports that the sale of national territory to foreigners violates the ban, and the Party and government authorities have issued repeated warnings. However, recently, Xu Jiyu, a local bully and land guarantor of the 28th Bao 6th Tu in the French Concession, colluded with land vendors Zhu and Ji to privately sell 1.53 mu of land from single household He Dianzhang in the 212th Shanhu of Duanzihui and 0.88 mu of land from number 314, (current property owner He Genfa and He Xiangen, who live at Nantangzi Jing, Hongqiao) to Toa Dobun Shoin through a private contract. The local bully and land vendors dared to take advantage of the anti-Japanese sentiment to profit from greed and violate national law. Therefore, the residents of the area have petitioned the authorities to thoroughly investigate and punish them severely.</p>

<h3>The Northern New Bookstore Has Not Yet Been Sealed</h3>
<p>The Booksellers' Association Cables Request for Legal Handling</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the "Little Pig Bajie" published by the Northern New Bookstore insulting Islam, the Executive Yuan has already instructed the Shanghai Municipal Government to, together with the court, seal up the Northern New Bookstore. Upon hearing this news, the bookstore immediately announced a temporary closure. At the same time, after receiving the Executive Yuan's instructions, the Municipal Government immediately sent a document to the First Special District Court requesting the execution of the sealing. However, as of last night, the First Special District Court had not yet executed it.</p>
<p>The Booksellers' Association cabled the Central Government yesterday, stating: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan, re: the misunderstanding between Nanhua and the Northern New Bookstore and Muslims caused by the article 'Little Pig Bajie'. The method of handling Nanhua is clearly appropriate. Today's newspaper reported that the Executive Yuan's approval included the words 'the Northern New Bookstore should be sealed immediately,' which is deeply alarming. Firstly, in a country governed by law, no matter what the crime, it should be judged by the court according to law, and there seems to be no reason to seal it immediately. Secondly, since the publisher, editor, and author are being investigated according to law, why must the bookstore be sealed first? Moreover, it is the same crime but different punishment compared to Nanhua. The association has already resolved to order the Northern New Bookstore to publish an apology in the newspaper and send the book to the Shanghai Municipal Government to await legal handling. We earnestly request that the sealing order be revoked immediately in order to comply with the rule of law and maintain commerce. We are filled with trepidation as we await orders."</p>
<h3>Representatives of Hebei Muslims Arrive in Shanghai from Beijing</h3>
<p>The delegation of Muslim petitioners from Hebei arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Beijing. In addition to the four representatives, Wang Zixin, Wang Mengyang, Liu Boshi, and Ma Ziwen, Tang Kesan, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and Sun Shengwu, the former Director of Finance of Anhui Province, also arrived. When the cars arrived at the North Station, about several hundred Muslims from Shanghai lined up to welcome them with banners that read "Welcome the Petition Representatives from Hebei to Shanghai." They were greeted by Da Pusheng, Ha Decheng, Jin Xusheng, Ha Shaofu, Su Zixiang, and others, and were taken in more than ten cars directly to the Islamic Mosque on Fuyou Road in the city to rest. The Islamic Fellowship hosted a banquet in the temple to welcome the representatives of the petitioners from both the north and south, and invited religious leaders and elders from various places to accompany them. After taking their seats, Su Zixiang, the representative of the Islamic Fellowship, stood up first to deliver a welcoming speech, which briefly stated that it was a great pleasure to welcome the representatives of the petitioners from both the north and south, as well as Mr. Tang Kesan and Mr. Sun Yanwing, and that the northerners and southerners were gathered together. The meaning of the welcome was divided into four points: (1) trust, (2) hard work, (3) success, and (4) cooperation. Then, he recited the welcoming speech. Subsequently, Wang Zixin, Tang Kesan, and Liu Boshi, representatives from the north, delivered speeches thanking them for their welcome. Finally, Da Pusheng, the religious leader, lectured on the 110th chapter of the Quran to encourage his fellow believers, and his words were extremely cautionary. They did not disperse until 11:00 p.m., when they had all enjoyed themselves.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Compatriot Association Sends a Letter Requesting</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government to Announce the Facts of Wang Xinfu's Case</p>
<p>Business License Certifies Legitimate Merchant</p>
<p>Newspaper Reports of Municipal Government Wanted Case</p>
<p>Therefore, Please Publicly Announce the Case</p>
<p>Wang Xinfu, a native of Ningbo, opened the Huaxing Soap Factory on Yuezhou Road. On the 23rd of last month, a fire broke out in the soap-making oil pot at the factory, leading to a misunderstanding with the fire brigade. He was summoned by the Public Security Bureau of the district. Later, it was rumored that someone accused him of being a traitor, and pointed out that Wang Xinfu was actually the fleeing Wang Du, using a pseudonym. He was escorted to the Ministry of Military Affairs by the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. His family, feeling that the matter was unjust, appealed to the Ningbo Compatriot Association in Shanghai to redress the grievance, and the factory and business firms there jointly sent a letter guaranteeing that Wang Xinfu was indeed a legitimate merchant. The association, based on the facts, sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting them to announce the facts of Wang Xinfu's case to clarify the truth. The letter stated: "Respectfully, according to the letter from fellow villager Wang Lichang, (above omitted), my father, Wang Xinfu, was rumored to have been falsely accused of being a traitor, and it was pointed out that my father was the alias of Wang Du. This is a bizarre case of mistaken identity. During the January 28th Incident, our factory was close to the war zone and was forced to close. My father led his family back to his hometown to take refuge. The facts are all there. How can he be called a traitor? Moreover, Wang Du is said to be from Anhui, while my father has lived in Yin County for generations. Such a case of calling a deer a horse and framing someone is unjustifiable. My father is a member of your esteemed association, and we ask you to uphold justice and provide assistance. In addition, fourteen business firms, including Shun Kang Factory, have jointly sent a letter guaranteeing that Wang Xinfu is indeed a merchant and that he has been framed this time, which is indeed a grievance. The association, based on the facts, sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau requesting them to investigate and release him. Afterwards, we read in the local newspapers of the 11th of this month a news item that the traitor Wang Xinfu was escorted to Beijing for trial. The report stated that the Municipal Government had issued an arrest warrant. My colleagues in the association are deeply suspicious. If Wang Xinfu is a traitor, we should all abandon him and never protect him because of our friendship as fellow villagers. However, the factories and business firms in the neighborhood are all willing to jointly guarantee that Wang Xinfu is indeed a legitimate merchant and are willing to be held jointly liable if there is any falsehood. These factories and business firms all have families and businesses and are so responsible for their guarantees, which proves that Wang Xinfu has absolutely no improper behavior. Is the arrest warrant issued by your government, as reported in the newspaper, true? If it is true that there is an arrest warrant, please publicly announce the facts of the case to clarify the truth and redress the grievance. Therefore, we respectfully request the Mayor to examine and verify the facts and provide a reply. We are deeply grateful."</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Public Works Department to Demolish Unregistered Straw Sheds</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent demolition of unregistered straw sheds in the eastern district of the concession, various rumors are actually caused by three people who call themselves representatives of the shantytown residents. Two of them are shantytown residents, and the other one is an employee of a yarn factory in Yangshupu and not a shantytown resident. The Public Works Department has always been very considerate of the people living in the straw sheds, but in order to limit the number of these straw sheds, which are detrimental to public health, and to improve the cleanliness of the surrounding environment, the Public Works Department established conditions with the Shantytown Association in July last year to register all existing sheds and prohibit any additional construction in the future. However, after the chaos this spring, many more sheds were added. The Public Works Department, in view of the difficult situation after the war, did not immediately punish them. After the normal state had been restored, the Public Works Department issued a one-month notice in September, ordering the 800 newly built straw sheds to be removed, otherwise they would be demolished. The deadline was already very generous, so after the deadline, people were sent to demolish them, and no one actively opposed it. Now, although the three people who call themselves representatives are making various propaganda, the Shantytown Association knows that these new sheds violate the conditions, and there is no reason to oppose the demolition. Some people may think that the demolition of the straw sheds is only because they are not registered, but they do not know that the original condition was that they were not allowed to be built in the first place.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Could Not Find the Eight Provinces Righteous Army Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>Said to Be Liu Jue's Claim</p>
<p>It was reported that a certain Liu Jue (alias Meng'an) was staying at Room 811 of the YMCA dormitory. Because he interfered with the business of a store, he was arrested by the French police. At the police station, he claimed to be the secretary of the Chinese consultant of the League of Nations Investigation Team. The police suspected his claims and sent people to investigate the YMCA dormitory. In his room, they searched and removed 17 irrelevant letters, drafts, pawn tickets, etc. The next morning, he was released. Unexpectedly, as soon as Liu regained his freedom, he printed 500 copies of a quick mail telegram in the name of the Preparatory Committee of the Volunteer Allied Army of Eight Southwestern Provinces and distributed them everywhere, and sent them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing and other places. The telegram stated that the office of the committee was suddenly searched by the armed police of the French Concession on the 3rd, and a number of telegram copies from various provinces, a copy of the English secret code of the Chinese Embassy in Paris, a purchase order for military supplies from the Hong Kong Swiss Foreign Company, a short-term deposit slip from the Shanghai Bank, a deposit certificate in Liu Jue's name from the Northern Continental Bank, and important official documents and seals were all taken away. It was reported that the committee's director, Liu Jue, was under surveillance and shackled. He was released on bail by Gan Jiehou, Zhang Shizhao, and others. According to the report, the Municipal Government immediately sent personnel to investigate the case, since it had never heard of the Volunteer Allied Army of Eight Southwestern Provinces and the case involved the illegal arrest of Chinese citizens in the concession. The investigation revealed that all the claims in Liu's telegram were false. The French police also absolutely denied that he had been shackled. As for the items seized, apart from eleven pawn tickets, three receipts for small sums of money remitted from the Shanghai Bank to Hangzhou, four letters from Zhang Shizhao, and nine bundles of miscellaneous drafts, there was nothing of value. Further investigation at the Shanghai Bank revealed that there was no short-term deposit account in Liu's name. Zhang Shizhao's law office denied that he had posted bail on his behalf, and Gan Jiehou was not in Shanghai at the time. Inquiries at the YMCA dormitory revealed that Liu owed a lot of room and board, barbers fees, etc. The large number of pawn tickets on his bed showed his poverty. The so-called Shanghai office of the Preparatory Committee of the Volunteer Allied Army of Eight Southwestern Provinces was merely Liu's claim. His words and actions seemed to be those of a neurotic.</p>
<h3>The Volunteer Army Medical Team</h3>
<p>The First Batch of Team Members Will Leave the Pass</p>
<p>Since the first batch of team members of the Northeast Volunteer Army Medical Team arrived in Ping, they have been contacting various parties to discuss matters related to leaving the pass, and they have made considerable progress.

We will definitely leave the pass on the 15th. We hope that the funds for medicines will be remitted to Ping one after another. Jiang Xing bows."</p>
<p>▲Successful negotiations The leader of the team, Fei Jian, went to Hangzhou by car on the evening of the 10th to contact various circles for assistance. According to a letter from Fei Jian from Hangzhou yesterday, after arriving in Hangzhou, he contacted various party and government agencies, anti-Japanese associations, and charity associations, and the negotiations were quite satisfactory. The Charity Association has scheduled a meeting for next Monday and asked Jian to attend and report on the progress. Therefore, he will not be able to return to Shanghai until next Tuesday. The Bank of China has agreed to collect donations on his behalf without charging any fees. He hopes that the work in Shanghai will be carried out carefully, etc.</p>
<p>▲Team affairs progressing In order to develop the team affairs and achieve the goal of real rescue, the team has been working actively in recent days.

<h3>Two Companies Donate Salaries to Help the Northeast Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Bookstore, the Shanghai Chinese Bookstore, followed the government's order on the National Day and did not take a holiday during the difficult period. All employees worked as usual and did not receive double pay. The company donated the amount equal to one day's salary of all employees to the Northeast Volunteer Army, totaling 1,028 yuan, which was sent to the Jin Cheng Bank for collection. On the birthday of the Prime Minister this time, it still followed the government's announcement and handled it according to the National Day precedent. The company also donated the amount equal to one day's salary of all employees, totaling 1,028 yuan, to the Northeast Volunteer Army for winter clothing, which was sent to the Jin Cheng Bank for collection.</p>
<p>▲The Zhabei Shanghai Chinese Public Bus Company, the Shanghai Chinese Public Bus Company in Zhabei, resumed operations after the war. In view of the fall of the Northeast and the widespread disaster among the refugees, it is urgent to provide assistance and relief to fulfill the duties of a national citizen. Huang Zhongwen, the general manager of the company, specially launched a donation campaign and solicited donations from the company's employees to provide assistance. It is reported that the employees were very enthusiastic. In addition to the company's donation of 50 yuan, each employee donated one day's wages.</p>

<h3>The Initiation of the Sanmen Bay Production Cooperative</h3>
<p>Since the government sent personnel to investigate and give instructions for the opening of Sanmen Bay, capitalists at home and abroad have risen up to establish companies and purchase properties in the area, or engage in construction. The news has been reported repeatedly in previous newspapers. However, those who start from the production business to develop Sanmen Bay are still rare. Recently, it was heard that Yuan Ludeng and others initiated the Sanmen Bay Production Cooperative, aiming to develop Sanmen Bay from the production side. The first step is to plant 1,000 mu of pyrethrum. It is said that the cooperative has hired experts to conduct in-depth research, which can certainly recover the original capital within three to five years. The office is currently located at No. 322, Shanghai Bank Building, Jiangxi Road, and it will soon begin to formally solicit members.</p>
<h3>The Yan Maoyuan Hotel was Suddenly Cut Off from Electricity</h3>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association Asks the Public Works Department to Order a Stop to the Action</p>
<p>The Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the General Manager of the Public Works Department regarding the electricity company cutting off the electricity to the Yan Maoyuan Hotel, stating: "Respectfully, according to a letter from the Lao Yan Maoyuan Luji Hotel in Zhongshi, Fuzhou Road, since taking over the business on September 1, 1932, the business has been affected by the war and the business has been in a slump. There are very few customers on the second and third floors, and there are even many nights when no lights are turned on. The electricity consumption downstairs is extremely limited. The monthly fee is clearly marked on the meter. The company sends personnel to verify the meter and issue receipts for payment. There is no allocation arrears or any violation of regulations. However, the company sent someone to the store seven days ago to replace the meter without any prior notice, so we were confused. Unexpectedly, after many days, the company sent someone to the store and ordered us to send someone to the company to negotiate. According to the director, we must pay more than 2,000 taels of silver for electricity bills from September 1, 1931, to the present day within 48 hours, otherwise the electricity will be cut off. The electricity bills are clearly stated on the meter and should be paid monthly. There is no default in payment, which is in accordance with the law and reason. If the electricity is cut off, the business losses will be unimaginable. We respectfully ask your association to uphold justice and strive for our rights to maintain our business. In addition, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Shaoxing Wine Industry Association with the same request. While we were verifying the matter, we received a report from the store stating that the electricity company had cut off the electricity on the afternoon of November 11. Based on this, we have paid the electricity fees according to the meter, which fulfills the responsibility of the user. It is incomprehensible to demand the supplementary payment of electricity fees afterwards. Furthermore, it is improper to ask users to pay supplementary electricity fees based on the unilateral claim of the electricity company without any basis. It is even more outrageous to set a deadline to cut off the electricity. Such actions are close to oppression and cannot be convincing, and will make all users in the concession feel chilled. Everyone is afraid of being coerced into paying supplementary electricity fees under the threat of power outages based on the electricity company's own intentions. Based on the above facts, we hereby send this letter to your office, requesting that you immediately stop the electricity company's power outage and restore the original situation. Please also investigate and determine the basis for demanding that users pay supplementary electricity fees. Sincerely, Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department."</p>
<h3>The Water Supply to Yuanyuli was Suddenly Cut Off</h3>
<p>Requesting Fair Mediation</p>
<p>The Real Estate Department of the China Reclamation Bank appealed: "Respectfully, our office has 45 houses in Yuanyuli, Songpan Road, Yangshupu, in the Eastern District, with monthly rentals of approximately 400 yuan. Most of the residents are poor laborers. Since the January 28th Incident, the economy has been sluggish and life has been difficult. However, the British Shanghai Waterworks Company forcibly installed water meters and charged according to the meter at this time. The monthly bill is often around 4,000 gallons, totaling more than 240 yuan, which is almost half of the total rent and more than seven times the rate of 0.075. Our office has been complying with the notice of your association and temporarily paying at the original price before the problem is resolved. However, the company refused to accept the payment and suddenly closed the main pipe at 10:00 a.m. on November 11, cutting off the water supply. The lives of hundreds of residents are at stake. The company's actions are likely to harm more than just our office. We hereby report this to your association and request that you quickly mediate fairly to protect the lives of the people. We are extremely grateful."</p>
<h3>Attention to Concession Stores</h3>
<p>Installing Wireless Radios</p>
<p>Recently, many stores in the concession have installed wireless radios at the entrance, with the sole purpose of attracting business. However, the sound of the radio often causes passersby and idlers to stop outside the door and listen, causing crowds to gather on the sidewalk, obstructing traffic. Sometimes, these listeners also stand on the road, which really obstructs the traffic of vehicles. The Police Department of the Public Works Department, in view of this, has decided to prohibit such traffic-obstructing behavior. A few days ago, it specifically requested four summons from the Special District Court and summoned the managers of the stores at No. 183, 398, 596, and 688 Xinzha Road on the 9th of this month. After the managers were tried by a certain judge, the police charged them with violating Article 36 of the By-laws of the Public Works Department. Although there was no penalty as a result of the trial, the judge warned the store managers that they must move the wireless radios elsewhere in the future to avoid causing crowds to gather on the sidewalk and obstructing traffic.</p>
<h3>Director of the Bureau of Education</h3>
<p>Orders Against Arbitrary Intrusion into Homes</p>
<p>Gong Kui, the Superintendent of the Municipal Police Bureau, recently noted that some inspectors from this bureau, without orders, had been arbitrarily entering homes to arrest those involved in flower gambling, leading to the growth of unscrupulous individuals. Some even impersonated public officials, using the guise of arresting flower gamblers to commit fraud. He ordered all inspectors under his command to refrain from arbitrary arrests without specific instructions from him, to prevent abuse and maintain public order. Yesterday, the Director of the Bureau of Education also instructed all bureau staff that the responsibility for apprehending flower gamblers rested solely with the district offices and detective squads, and that they should not arbitrarily search homes. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3>Guanshengyuan Restaurant's Charity Drive</h3>
<p>Today's Entire Revenue Donated to the Northeast Refugee Relief Association</p>
<p>The Guanshengyuan Food Company on Nanjing Road, recently, due to the successive natural disasters and wars in the Northeast provinces, leading to the suffering and displacement of our compatriots, who have lost their livelihoods. At this time of howling winds and bitter cold, the misery of those starving and freezing is unimaginable. In the spirit of human mutual aid, the company is emulating last year's flood relief efforts and donating today's entire revenue from the second-floor restaurant, including the standard 10% service charge and tips for waiters, to the Northeast Refugee Relief Association for aid. All dishes are priced as usual, and no donations will be collected within the premises. This approach has garnered much support from various sectors. It is expected that many will come to support this righteous cause.</p>
<h3>Two Hotels Net a Large Group of Robbers</h3>
<p>Robbers Leave Restaurant Tickets in Hotel</p>
<p>Detectives Find Clues</p>
<p>Franco-Chinese detectives from the French Concession, acting on information received in the afternoon, discovered a large group of robbers hiding in the Oriental and Far Eastern Hotels at the intersection of Xizang Road and North Sea Road in the Public Concession. They immediately joined forces with detectives from the Laozha Police Station of the Public Concession. They first went to room 453 on the fourth floor of the Oriental Hotel, where they apprehended three robbers. Detectives then disguised themselves as waiters and waited in the room. By late night, they had captured a total of twenty-one members of the gang. Yesterday, they caught three more. Then, they went to the Far Eastern Hotel and apprehended five more robbers. All were taken to the Laozha Police Station to await interrogation. It is reported that the reason for breaking this robber case was that the robbers had robbed a resident with the surname of a certain resident in the French Concession of their belongings. At the time, they robbed silk clothing and exchanged their old clothes, leaving one piece behind at the victim's home. The detectives from the French Concession took it back to the police station, where they found a restaurant ticket for room 453 of the Oriental Hotel and another for a room in the Far Eastern Hotel in the pocket. They went to the addresses and waited to make the arrests. Among these criminals were robbers, kidnappers, and hooligans. All were captured in one fell swoop by the detectives.</p>
<h3>Record of the Zhang-Xu Wedding</h3>
<p>At 4 PM on the 12th of this month, Mr. Zhang Shenrong, a current commissioner of the Ministry of Railways, and Miss Xu Huiyuan held their wedding ceremony at the Moore Memorial Church on Sanma Road in this city. The wedding was officiated by Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of the Finance Department of the Ministry of Railways Chen Yaozu, former Minister to Belgium Wang Jingqi, and Chief Commander Liu Zhilu. Many dignitaries and guests attended, making it a grand affair. The groom, Mr. Zhang, holds a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of London and studied law in Paris, followed by academic research in Berlin for many years. The bride is the daughter of Mr. Xu Shaoqiu. Mr. Xu followed Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing in his early years, engaging in revolutionary work, possessing military and political knowledge, and serving in important military and political positions. He devoted himself to the revolution, achieving great accomplishments early in life. His daughter is also well-versed in both Chinese and Western learning and proficient in martial arts. The marriage of these two families, both prominent Cantonese clans, is truly a celebrated event of the time.</p>
<h3>Groom Opens Gambling Den, Arrested</h3>
<p>Boss Sentenced to Two Months, Gamblers Fined Twenty Yuan Each</p>
<p>Detective Guan Binliang and Western Detective Lin of the Xinzha Police Station, discovered that a stable groom from the Race Club was operating a gambling den at No. 444 Dazhan Road, allowing stable grooms and doormen to gamble inside, profiting from the cut. They secretly arrested the boss, Bei Rongsheng, and gamblers Wang Zhengpeng, Chen Zhengtian, Tang Qingsheng, and others, totaling twenty-two people, mostly stable grooms from the Race Club. They confiscated the Pai Gow tiles, mahjong tiles, wooden tiles, and gambling money and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the summary court of the First Special District. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the case, presenting the gambling paraphernalia and money. Judge Huang Risheng questioned each defendant one by one and sentenced the boss, Bei Rongsheng, to two months of imprisonment, and the remaining twenty-one people, including Wang Zhengpeng, were fined twenty yuan each. The gambling paraphernalia and money were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Restaurant Employee Conspires Unlawfully after Dismissal</h3>
<p>Discussing Robbery in Hotel</p>
<p>Plans Discovered Before Implementation</p>
<p>Zhao A'san, from Wuxi, used to work in a restaurant next to the Grand Theater on Sanma Road. Recently, due to being dismissed for several days, he was short on money and in dire straits, so he came up with the idea that the neighboring liquor and food store did not do so poorly, that there was a chance to rob it. He invited fellow villagers Zhu Fuqian and Zhu Ayin, and Fuqian brought a handgun loaded with five bullets. They went to the Champagne Hotel at 114 Yunnan Road and opened room 34 to discuss how to carry out the robbery. However, the plan was discovered by the Huishi Police Station's Chinese Detective Shang Wu. At 10 PM the previous evening, he brought detectives Wang Youshan and Liu Shaotian, and secretly arrested Zhao and the two Zhus, and confiscated the gun and bullets under the pillow, taking them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the case, saying that the case still needed to be investigated and had not yet been prosecuted, and requested permission to detain them. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the report and questioned the three defendants and approved the detention until the 16th of this month for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Public Works Bureau Employee for Extortion</h3>
<p>Gao Zhengqi and Wang Zhengnan Await Sentencing</p>
<p>Gao Zhengqi, a Jiangbei servant in the Public Works Bureau's Sanitation Department on Yulin Road, colluded with Luo Decai at a shed near Yanshan Road and Qiwu Street on the afternoon of the 5th of this month. He demanded two yuan in "dismantling fees" from Zhou Tongren, a pig farmer from Yancheng, and took a pig's head. The case was discovered, and he was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao Linyu held a hearing for further questioning. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the case was being rescheduled and that Gao Zhengqi had been found to have impersonated a Public Works Bureau employee on the 23rd of last month. He went to the Dai Tongxin noodle shop at 350 Yangshupu Road, claiming that there was an fee to obtain a license, of fifty yuan. As a result, his friend Wang Zhengnan mediated and paid ten yuan. However, Gao Zhengqi admitted to this money at the police station. Chu Kunfa, an inspector from the Sanitation Department, obtained eight yuan, and Chen Ronggao, a worker, obtained one yuan. He only got one yuan, but he had no right to investigate licenses in shops. Today, the Sanitation Department's foreigner and Chu and Chen had all come to court to testify. Dai Tongxin then testified that the defendant Gao Zhengqi came to extort money that day, taking ten yuan, etc. Chu Kunfa testified that he was an inspector in the Sanitation Department and had to be accompanied by a foreigner to investigate licenses in shops. The defendant's statement was completely false. Chen Ronggao also denied getting one yuan. When questioned, the two defendants were evasive. After reviewing the statements, Judge Zhao ordered them to be returned to custody and scheduled a sentencing date.</p>

<p>Truly Incomprehensible</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 1:00 PM, Police Officer Zhang Yinian of the 24th post of the First Section of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, found a Russian beggar named Fei Xilifu (transliteration) in Da Wang Miao Street in the South City, carrying a young girl of about ten years old. They were acting suspiciously. The police officer immediately brought the two of them to the station. During the preliminary hearing by the director of the station, because the two sides could not understand each other's language, the Russian beggar Fei Xilifu could not explain the origin of the girl. When the girl was asked, she was a mute, speaking incoherently and gesturing, which was incomprehensible. Because one was a foreigner and the other was a mute, the case could not be investigated. An official document was prepared and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>Warehouse Shortage Acknowledged</h3>

Yan Maosheng, a fellow villager, often visited her. Because of the relationship with the village, the woman did not find anything to be amiss. Unexpectedly, Yan took advantage of an opportunity to abduct her daughter Yaomei under the pretext of seeking flower associations in the countryside. Then, he delivered the girl to the Xuyi Quan of Bai Mayi in Nanyao to sell to Qingpu. When it was discovered by the Nanyao police team of Qingpu County, Xu and Yan's actions were deceptive. They were immediately detained and escorted to the team headquarters by Team Leader Bian Jingcheng and Special Agent Shu Changsheng for interrogation in detail. Yan Maosheng frankly admitted that he had abducted her from Shanghai. Team Leader Bian Jingcheng prepared a letter to inform the mother to come to Qingpu to identify her daughter. Wang Xu, bereaved of her beloved daughter, the only daughter and the bone remains of her husband, was crying and wishing to die. Receiving this letter, she smiled through her tears and rushed to the Nanyao police team of Qingpu County. The mother and daughter were reunited. The police team leader, in light of Wang Xu's loneliness and poverty, did not allow the woman to spend a penny on all expenses. Therefore, the mother and daughter did not stop praising the benevolence of Team Leader Bian.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Judge Fessenden's Report on the Shanghai International Settlement, Volume 4 (21)</h3>
<p>(1) Amendment of the Land Regulations</p>
<p>26. If proceeding according to the suggestions already made to amend other aspects of the Land Regulations, it would be clearly appropriate to seize this opportunity to delete the appended conditions of Clause 24 of the Land Regulations, so that the Board of Directors would be free from restraint, and would not need to obtain the approval of the taxpayers' meeting regarding matters related to staff members, so that the policy contained in the existing pension plan could be carried out to its logical conclusion. In this way, the position of some staff members would be the same as that of civil servants. If this could be achieved, then a rule could be established to stipulate that only those within a certain grade, that is, those listed in the "permanent" staff roster, could be included. The main provisions that can be included in this rule are briefly described in an appendix to this report by me. (Note 9)</p>
<p>27. It may be noted that, although the proposed provisions are intended to limit the power of the Board of Directors to dismiss staff members before they are eligible to receive what is now called the "minimum pension," there are various reasons other than misconduct of staff members, that should allow the Bureau to continue to exercise this power, but a portion of the pension or other remuneration calculated in proportion to the years of service, must be given to the staff member. In this regard, the power of the Board of Directors to deliberate and handle the matter is indeed broad. Some people may think that the word "permanent" does not apply to services that must be controlled by such rules, but the principles included in this plan, if recognized, should obviously greatly improve the current status of the Bureau's staff members within the scope of the plan regarding tenure security.</p>
<p>The outstanding question regarding any such plan is how to establish a reasonable tenure security for the personnel employed, and how to protect the Board of Directors, so that it is not burdened by the incompetence or unsuitability of staff members in handling affairs. The so-called incompetent or unsuitable staff members are those who are generally incapable of handling affairs, or whose positions are not suitable for their abilities.</p>
<p>28. One of the main features of the above-proposed method is that a municipal service committee should be specially organized, one of its tasks is to investigate permanent staff members who are accused of misconduct. If the result of the investigation shows that the staff member is indeed guilty of misconduct, and should be dismissed, demoted, or have their salary reduced, the Board of Directors should follow suit. If a permanent staff member is to be dismissed by the Board of Directors for reasons other than misconduct, the staff member may request that the proposal be submitted to the committee for consideration, but the dismissed staff member, if still able to receive a portion of the pension or other remuneration calculated in proportion to the years of service, the Board of Directors is not bound by the committee's report, and may handle the report after considering it, in accordance with what it deems appropriate.</p>
<p>29. Staff members who are dismissed and have their pensions and retirement savings confiscated are recognized as clearly different from those who are dismissed without such confiscation. Although staff members have the same right to request the committee to intervene in events regarding the latter, as in the former, in events not involving the confiscation of rights, the Board of Directors is free to deliberate and handle the matter after considering the committee's report.</p>
<p>In addition, there are several other tasks that the committee may be asked to undertake, which will be described below.</p>
<p>(2) Resolution of the Taxpayers' Meeting</p>
<p>30. If the Land Regulations cannot be amended in the near future, the second way to solve this problem is for the taxpayers' meeting to pass a resolution at any time, so that the Board of Directors can obtain the recognition of the taxpayers in accordance with the provisions of Clause 20 of the Land Regulations, and apply special service conditions, such as those suggested under heading (1), to staff members whom the Bureau wishes to include in the permanent roster. In this way, the Bureau can have a standard to sign contracts with relevant staff members, without being restricted by the three-year term stipulated in the existing Land Regulations. (Note 10)</p>
<p>(3) Amendment of the Pension Regulations</p>
<p>31. The proposed third method is only to amend the pension regulations, so that staff members who are entitled to pension benefits, if they leave before reaching the age at which they can enjoy the minimum pension stipulated in the existing pension regulations, can receive a portion of the pension calculated in proportion to the years of service within certain restrictions.

<h3>Do Chrysanthemums Match Reclusive Hermits?</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Any literati can effortlessly recite Zhou Maoshu's saying: "Chrysanthemums are the recluses of flowers." Therefore, upon seeing chrysanthemums, literati automatically consider themselves to be facing a reclusive hermit, and all published works invariably regard chrysanthemums as hermits. Alas! Do chrysanthemums match reclusive hermits? I don't think so.</p>
<p>If chrysanthemums match reclusive hermits, then, in the past two months, one could meet hermits anywhere. Go to a teahouse for tea, and there are hermits; go to a restaurant for drinks, and there are hermits; go to a theater for a play, and there are hermits. These hermits are at everyone's beck and call, moving east when told to move east, and moving west when told to move west, solely because they have abandoned their homeland by the eastern fence and specialize in bustling places to provide flowery embellishments to life. If Zhou Maoshu were alive today, he would certainly not call them hermits among flowers, but rather call them politicians among flowers.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a grand chrysanthemum exhibition is held, with all sorts of labels inserted in the chrysanthemum pots; it is just like holding a grand meeting of politicians, with diverse political views, all wearing badges on their chests. Alas! Chrysanthemums, chrysanthemums, your political color is a bit too strong!</p>
<p>From chrysanthemums, I also thought of the willow catkins of spring; people call willow catkins frivolous, but they are not. Willow catkins are martyrs among flowers. Once the spring is gone, willow catkins flutter away from the trees, unafraid of being crushed to pieces, stained with mud, and entering the water, determined to share the same fate as the spring; this spirit of sacrifice is worthy of our respect.</p>
<p>Rather than appreciating the politician-like chrysanthemums, it is better to worship the martyr-like willow catkins.</p>

<p>In your right hand, you hold a foreskin-like thing, stuffing it full of old newspapers, thinking you are hiding doctoral and master's diplomas from Tokyo, New York, London, Paris... advertising that you truly understand the languages of Japan, America, Britain, France... Thus, you spread it before your friends under your sway, how they foolishly listen and admire. As for you! How proud and self-satisfied you are!</p>
<p>Frogs frolic and sing on the lotus leaves in the lotus pond, how full of natural interest! At this time, a water buffalo comes along, it drinks water by the pond; somehow it aroused the frogs' interest in comparing bellies with the buffalo. Think, how much bloating ability does a frog's belly have, finally bloating the thin and tender belly to pieces. 丨Earning the ridicule and insults of its kind!</p>

<p>The pig locked in the fence, getting sustenance from its owner, is complacent and sleeps soundly. It often makes a few deep nasal sounds in a dazed state, never thinking about how far and deep its future is, or the gains and losses. Even during the day, it is generally asleep, unless it is time to eat.</p>
<p>The young masters who inherit their ancestors' estates also know that the pigs locked in the fence have the same symptoms, but they also have the same fate.

<h3>Funny Talk about Minor Marriages</h3>
<p>— Jin Butong</p>
<p>丨Deceiving and Being Deceived丨</p>
<p>Once, I had a classmate who wanted to find a spouse, not aiming too high, not settling too low, after five or six years, even matchmakers disappeared. He was worried about the three unfilial acts, the greatest of which is having no offspring, so he came up with the whimsical idea of ​​posting a marriage advertisement in the newspaper. After three days of advertising, he took a trip to the newspaper's mailbox and actually retrieved seven response letters. He was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth, thinking that among these seven letters, he could always find a wife who was eight-tenths to his liking. How could he know that it would almost take his breath away after reading them. One letter said, "If you want a wife, go to Qinglian Pavilion to find one." (Qinglian Pavilion is where the most low-class prostitutes in Shanghai are.) One said, "Wait until I marry and have children and then marry you." One said, "This is my small portrait, what do you think?" Enclosed in the letter was a calendar girl picture. One said, "My old nanny is not bad looking, 62 years old, willing to introduce her to you." The remaining three letters were similar, all trying to have fun, and for a time, it became a laughingstock among friends.</p>
<p>Later, his classmates, seeing him getting older day by day, advised him to compromise and get married. So, with the help of a friend, he married a lady. But he was still upset after the last incident, so he posted a female advertisement seeking a spouse for one day, and received a total of twenty-two letters. He cut them open one by one to read them. Each letter had a photo attached, some of which were artistic photos. There were seventeen wearing suits, four in casual clothes, and one in military uniform. The one in military uniform was a staff officer. In the twenty-two response letters, all uniformly reported their age, place of origin, education, and occupation. The least amount of family property was 10,000, and the least monthly income was 80. The words in the letter were more gentle than lambs. My friend laughed haha after reading each letter. In the end, he returned them one by one. He said to me, "This time, I took revenge." For a time, it became a laughingstock among friends again.</p>
<h3>Slogans of Country Folks</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>丨Contradictions and Injustices of Urban Life丨</p>
<p>In the splendid city, the houses seen are tall and towering, with electric lights shining brightly; the streets walked are flat and wide, with bustling traffic; the people encountered are dressed in bright clothes, covered in perfumes, and everything else is aristocratic and modern, enough to make country folks dizzy. But there is also another side! Pigeon-cage-like rooms, where a family of all sizes lives, sleeping and eating there; even urination and defecation are done there. This also makes country folks strange, because the economy has reached this point, which cannot be found in the countryside. Even beggars who are so poor that they don't have "a tile to cover their heads" are more comfortable cooking casseroles in the temple of the earth. The living conditions of Shanghai people are truly unfair, the good ones are better than jade pavilions and jade buildings, the bitter ones are not even as good as pig pens.</p>
<p>Whether it's noon or night, no matter which road you walk on, your nose always smells a cooking fragrance, making your mouth water. Arousing the curiosity of country folks, he carefully investigated. Shanghai people's eating habits are indeed diverse and their taste is good. Speaking of foreign food, there are British, American, French, Italian, German, Japanese, and Russian styles. Speaking of Chinese food, there are Beijing style, Sichuan style, Fujian style, local style, and many other styles. If you stay in each restaurant and taste various flavors, I am afraid it will take a year to complete. Just as the country folks were admiring it, they suddenly saw a meal carrier passing by, and a few small rice-grabbing heroes jumped out of the alley to pour away the leftovers. The country folks then thought: those who eat, eat, those who are hungry, are hungry, one has so many styles and the other is suffering from hunger.</p>
<p>The clothes worn by those in suits, the country folks cannot name the fabric, but he knows very well that it comes from abroad, and an inch of the price is worth more than ten feet of old cloth in the countryside! Not to mention the clothes of modern girls, just take her feet to calculate, high-heeled leather shoes are imported goods, costing dozens of taels of silver; pure silk socks also cost a few taels of silver. The country folks thought: these coins in the countryside can build a thatched house, which can indeed accommodate several people, but now it is not enough to be trampled on by their feet for a month. The country folks couldn't help but secretly feel envious, but as he walked past a large wall, he saw a few brave heroes desperately tearing off the posters on the wall, preparing to use them as coats to resist the sharp northwest wind, and he secretly admired them again.</p>
<p>When country folks arrive in Shanghai, what he sees is contradiction and injustice. He is angry and hates it, so he also shouts slogans: the countryside is a fair, simple, and pure place. Come to the countryside!</p>
<h3>Short Messages</h3>

Thank Shakespeare for being so affectionate, secretly tying the red silk thread. This matchmaker is hard to find in the world. The osmanthus is fragrant and the weather is fine, don't waste the good time in vain. Ask Lang to tidy up the clouds." "Is the old story of the stage still remembered? Selling the coffin was a fluke!

<h3>The Poor Taoist's Death (13)</h3>
<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>4. Inerasable Scars</p>
<p>In her solitary life, Aigu also thought about her late husband Liu Agen in Cuiwei Village. She also disliked his rough black skin, loose braids, loud voice, and clumsy hands and feet, and it was difficult to recognize him as a lifelong partner. So, find another way out. She is only nineteen years old this year, and her precious youth has not yet passed, how can she stay inactive for a long time. Move, how to move? Which way to move? All sorts of questions often surged in her mind. During the day, newly acquainted sisters came to chat, and at night, she felt an unusual loneliness, and everything in the past kept coming to her mind.</p>
<p>She, who had no experience as a housewife, and had no productive capacity, had spent more than 130 yuan in three months. She then knew that what Lawyer Xia had said to her, "The monthly interest is enough for food and clothing," was a lie, a piece of candy to deceive her into agreeing to a divorce. Now, the outer edge of this candy is gradually disappearing, and the core is bitter. But she had already drawn a "cross" on a piece of paper, and she also knew that this was an ironclad proof that could not be changed in any way. Since she could not develop from this, she had to open up sources of income in other areas, because 30 yuan a month was the minimum, and she could no longer cut costs.</p>
<p>From the mouths of her sisters, she learned about their ways of making money. Apart from those who had husbands and relied on their husbands for support, the perfume, silk stockings, snacks, and gambling capital for playing mahjong were all earned by their own instincts and means. Although she had no hesitation about her chastity, and wished she could bite off a piece of flesh from the ungrateful Han Muliang, how could she care about his face, especially since he had already issued a statement in the newspaper severing ties. However, she felt too much bitterness from mixing day and night in the false and tentative manipulations of getting acquainted with strangers and drifting from one relationship to another. Therefore, she still did not dare to step into the threshold of this den of depravity, hovering outside the den, but she was unwilling to give up easily.</p>

<p>Gold Market Reaction</p>
<p>Price Drops by 6 Taels and 4 Mace</p>
<p>After several days of consecutive gains, the gold market suddenly weakened yesterday. The price retreated from the 750 tael level. Dealers were hesitant, with fluctuations limited to about one tael. The range from morning to noon was no more than 3 taels and 6 mace. Overall, this was a reaction to the consecutive days of gains, with a total drop of 6 taels and 4 mace. The initial drop was sharp, driven by a surge in British and American exchange rates, a slight decrease in large silver bar prices, and a near-term rise in American silver, further impacted by continued growth in American cotton. Later, the price seemed to recover by two or three taels, mainly due to foreign exchange trends, with British exchange rate firm and American exchange rate stable, causing slight changes. Gold prices fluctuated around 46 taels. Different parties showed varying buying and selling intentions, with a sudden surge to 47 or 48 taels at the end. The Central Bank purchased 105 gold bars on the spot market at a price of 52 taels, sold by Tai Kangrun. As the market will be closed on Saturday, and considering the chaotic market conditions this week, fluctuating between weakness and strength, the range was significant. The lowest price at the beginning of the week was 734 taels and some mace, while the highest price at the end of the week was 753 taels and 7 mace. After a subsequent decline, the total range for the week was 19 taels and 4 mace. Overall, this was still an increase of 1 tael and 8 mace compared to the previous Saturday. However, the volatility was unpredictable. Details of yesterday's morning market are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Initial Drop of 8 Taels and 4 Mace The December market opened with a drop of 8 taels and 4 mace, at 744 taels and 7 mace. (Before the market opened, the unofficial trading of goods saw fluctuations, initially at 46 or 47 taels, then 3 or 4 taels, and later around 6 taels.) Afterwards, Zhifeng, Yongyuan, and Chun, among others, sold, causing an immediate rise of over 2 taels. This was due to purchases by Yuanmao, Yongheng, and Xing. When the foreign exchange market opened, it was flat. Then, the Korean market bought US dollars for the current month at 93.75, wheat firms offered 8.75, and Citibank bought January at 1.25, resulting in a price of 46 taels and 6 mace. Dadecheng and Yuanchun, among others, sold at 9:15 for 5 taels and 3 mace. Subsequently, the British gold quote contracted by 0.25, and the US dollar remained unchanged, resulting in a price of 47 taels. After 9:30, Hengyu, Yuantai, Yuanmao, Yong, and others bought, pushing the price from 6 taels and 8 mace to 7 taels and 3 mace. The domestic US dollar market strengthened, with January dollars available for sale at 30 yuan. Before long, Yuanxing, Yongfutaiheng, and general speculators sold, causing a retreat to 6 taels. At 10:00, Yifeng, Yongfeng, Hengyu, Zhaofengchang, and others eagerly bought, especially as November US dollars were priced at only 75, and the spread for February was 0.0625. This pushed the price up by 1 tael and 6 or 7 mace, reaching 47 taels and 7 mace by 10:10. Afterwards, Hengxing, Fuyu, Xiexingyong, and others heavily sold, causing a sudden drop in the market, falling by 2 taels. However, from 10:15 to 11:00, there was a slight recovery of a few mace. (Qian Changxiang bought, as it was opening for the Central Bank's spot purchase of 105 bars.) Subsequently, it was only 5 taels and 5 mace. Soon after, Yuanmao, Yongqian, and Changxiang bought again, and HSBC's absorption of February US dollars at 1.25 immediately pulled the price up by 1 tael and 2 mace. Hengxing continued to sell, and at 11:15, it retreated slightly by 1 tael, settling at 5 taels and 7 mace. Dadecheng, Bingxing, Yifengyong, and others increased their bids, adding another tael. At 11:30, it reached 6 taels and 6 mace. In an instant, retail investors came to sell, and Hengxing limited its sales, resulting in a price of 5 taels and 6 mace at 11:45. Soon, wheat firms absorbed January at 30 yuan, and Zhifeng, Yonghengyu, and others competed to buy, pushing the price up by another tael. By the close at noon, it was 46 taels and 7 mace, a drop of 6 taels and 4 mace compared to the previous day. Unexpectedly, goods and other items were suddenly added, pulling the price up to 8 taels. The highest price for half a day was 7 taels and 7 mace, while the lowest was 4 taels and 1 mace, a difference of 3 taels and 6 mace. Pure silver bars still added 10 taels and 2 mace and 5 fen.</p>
<p>▲ Discounted Price Mostly at 6 Taels The announced price remained at 814 taels, a discount of 67 or 68 taels. Later, it was 66 taels, 68 taels at noon, and 66 or 67 taels at the end, a discount of 6 taels more than the previous day. Book price was 49 taels to 47 taels, with a make-up price of 47 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Trading Fairly Active Trading on the exchange was not light. According to statistics, Yuanmao, Fan Changxiang, Yongfeng, Zhifengyong, Bingxing, Hengchangyong, Yuantai, Hengyu, Zhengfengyong, and Dadecheng Yuan Kangxiang all bought, while Taichang, Xiexingyong, Yuanxingyong, Futaiheng, Richang, Yuanchun, and Fuyu all sold. Daxingyong, Shunli, Wanxing, and Zhaofengchang had occasional transactions, but in small amounts. Speculators bought. The Ningbo gang bought over 200 bars in total and sold over 100 bars. The Guangdong gang was slightly different. (Hengxing) sold 600-700 bars and bought over 200 bars. (Yifeng) bought 200-300 bars. These are the sales details reported by other firms.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate: British Firm, American Flat</h3>

When HSBC announced its exchange rates, the British gold quote contracted by 0.125, while the US dollar and Hong Kong rates remained unchanged. Most other rates were higher. In the domestic market, the British gold quote was initially flat but then firm, remaining the same as the previous day. Trading volume was approximately 100,000 pounds. The gold shops tended to buy, while Sassoon sold. The US dollar initially weakened but then strengthened, before fluctuating slightly, resulting in a flat close, up 0.125 from the previous day. The trading volume for half a day was approximately 600,000-700,000 yuan. Chinese gold shops mostly sold, because mark prices were weak, and the spread for speculators widened again. Thus, they bought silver bar futures, which was still favorable. Banks such as Maijia, Lao, and Citibank had limited appetite. It is rumored that Chinese gold firms held bullish positions of approximately 100,000-200,000 pounds in shillings and short positions of approximately 2 million US dollars.

<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Fall Back by 4-5 Jiao</h3>

Regarding the trends in bond prices, market sentiment was more stable than before, new transactions were gradually decreasing, and most transactions seemed to be for switching contracts, so the supply and demand situation was very flat, and various prices were still in a state of fluctuation. As a result, selling was slightly more advantageous, and prices fell by 3-4-5 jiao compared to the previous day. Only spot salt tax bonds and 19 customs small notes rose compared to the previous day due to lack of market in recent days. The market trend has become increasingly stable.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Market Affected by the Environment</p>
<p>丨Many Rumors ··· Extraordinary Tightening of Silver Market丨</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market started rising and then fell. In the morning, the rise in US cotton caused retailers to cover short positions, and the market trend became firm. However, some manufacturers took profits. It was reported that demand was sluggish. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly arose in the market, and the news about the situation was not good, causing a change in atmosphere. It was also said that a large number of Tianjin yarns were coming to Shanghai. The market suddenly trended downwards. In short, the environment was too bad, and the silver market was unusually tight. Therefore, although US cotton rose, people's hearts were still not enthusiastic.</p>
<p>▲ Renbiao Continues to Fall 7-8 Mace In the morning market, Renbiao opened, rising with foreign cotton, and then fell back in the second and third sessions, eventually falling by 1-2 mace. In the afternoon, people's hearts suddenly changed. Due to the unfavorable atmosphere, prices fell by 6-7-8 mace in various months. The total transaction volume for the day was 28,500 bales. It was found that Jifeng sold 650 bales, Zhenda 550 bales, Changyu 600 bales, and Tonghe 1,550 bales, while Mingde bought 1,000 bales, Shenji 1,000 bales, Changfeng 750 bales, and Yicheng 500 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>▲ Sales of Spot Yarn Few There were very few sales of spot yarn. Statistics show that only 242 bales were bought by various gangs throughout the day. The market conditions were firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon. The amounts bought by various parties are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 100 Xiamen 5 Guangdong 20 Same Trade 20 Zhenjiang 12 Fujian 15 Shantou 25 Ningbo 5 Luzhou 25 Hankou 5</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Rose in the Morning and Fell in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, but the US cotton continued to rise, and the market was still good, so people's hearts were tight. Later, in the afternoon, there were many rumors in the market, and the yarn market fell sharply, causing the related cotton market to fall as well. However, the demand from factories in the market gradually showed development, and although the prices in various producing areas fell, some had more firm intentions. The rising power of US cotton could be stabilized, and the cotton market may not fall.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Biao's Situation of Weak in the Near Term and Firm in the Distant Term Zheng Biao opened in the morning, tightened due to the rise in US cotton, and rose by 1.5-2.5 qian in each month. In the afternoon, it fell by 1.5 fen following the yarn market. The total transaction volume for the day was 91,300 dan. It was found that Taichang sold 5,600 dan, Sanling 900 dan, Xie 4,200 dan, Changji 3,200 dan, and Mingde 2,400 dan, while Changfeng bought 5,900 dan, Juji 2,700 dan, Dejiang 2,000 dan, Gengfeng 2,000 dan, and Yuanda 2,600 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>▲ The Appetite of Foreign Factories for Spot Cotton is Especially Strong The demand from spot cotton factories is strong, and foreign factories are particularly diligent in procurement. The source includes 390 bales of Yaohua and 1,293 bales of Tonghua.</p>

<h3>US Cotton Covers Shorts</h3>
<p>Continues to Rise Over 20 Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton rose strongly due to short covering, strong support from Wall Street, and buying. Futures prices rose by 17-23 points, and spot prices rose by 25 points. British cotton futures rose by 18-19 points, and spot prices rose by 16 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 2 points. Indian cotton initially rose with US cotton, but later weakened due to profit-taking by longs. Pingguoer rose by 4.25 rupees, Aubmra rose by 3.75 rupees, and Bai Luoxi rose by 5.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 11th):</p>

<h3>The Trend of US Cotton in the Past Week Has Gradually Increased</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 11th reports on the cotton market in the past week: The cotton market initially rose due to the start of cotton transactions, strong sales of spot cotton, and a stable actual position. Soon, it rebounded due to active short selling and a large increase in the government's estimated report on Wednesday. However, when near-month prices were below 6 points, demand was strong, and the market was too soft, so short selling in the South became sluggish and the supply in the mainland decreased. According to statistics for the past week, the amount of cotton listed in the week was less than the previous week. Therefore, some experts believe that the weakness of the market has passed, and the industry's needs have decreased when buying is active. According to another source, a large number of November shipments need to be covered. The weekend statistics are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3>Grain Market: River Down Rice Market Deteriorating Daily</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were still many ships arriving in the south of Shanghai, about 60-70. Retail sales in urban and rural stores were affected by the financial cotton market. Traders were even more miserable, so the market has been easing for days and sales are still difficult. As a result, people's morale is flagging, and the price of thick grain has fallen by another 3 jiao. Although the opening and closing prices were called yuan, they were falling step by step. The Ke-type rice merchants were slightly active, and the situation was stable. About 2,500 shi of River Down rice were opened.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday, there were more than 40 ships arriving at Xinzha. There were very few transactions on the street. Changshu, Xibei, and Jiangyin rice were each 2 jiao lower. There was no boom or bust in thin rice. The arrival and sales of Budu sharp were balanced. Around 2,500 stone of River Down were opened.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Price Falls, Sales Brisk</h3>
<p>丨Minnan Merchants Have a Stronger Appetite··· North Ocean Merchants Are Also Asking丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market completely stagnated. Ke Xian has not continued to arrive, but after the market price fell back, it has aroused the concern of Ke merchants. The appetite of Fuzhou merchants is stronger, and Tianjin merchants are also inquiring slightly. The market seems to be turning from weak to stable. A total of 100 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice were sold at a price of 8 yuan 6 jiao. 109 bags of Hunan machine-milled yuan rice were sold at a price of 10 yuan. 436 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice were sold at a price of 8 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen to 8 yuan 8 jiao. 350 bags of machine-milled Jingjiang were sold at a price of 8 yuan 4 jiao to 8 yuan medium. Except for Xiang machine yuan, which was purchased by Tianjin merchants, all of them were purchased by Fuzhou merchants. The price continued to be 4-5 fen smaller than the previous day, 4-5 jiao smaller than the beginning of the month, and 7-8 jiao smaller than the highest market price. However, with the purchase of Min and Jin yesterday, the market situation may be stabilized.</p>
<h3>Flour Futures Market Active, Market Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of each month generally showed a flat and stable trend. Because there were no quotations for foreign wheat, the sentiments of both parties were calm. However, since the selling was not prosperous, the buying was still active, so although the initial opening was flat, it gradually became more profitable, and the prices of the recent months were slightly better. When the market opened in the afternoon, the major players' intentions were very firm. Because the prices in each period, near and distant, were clearly high and secretly active, they wanted to revive their morale. However, Nan Yang wheat has sold, and the number of lots issued by each dealer was about another 100,000 bags. However, people's hearts remained unmoved. Before the large buyers exhausted their resources, they would not let go. As a result, the price of this month rose by 7.5 li from the previous day, the price of December rose by 1.5 fen, the price of January rose by 2 fen, the price of February rose by 1.5 fen, the price of March rose by 1 fen 2 li, and the price of April rose by 1 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Initially Stable, Then Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon with prices for various months generally showing an initial stability followed by a steady trend. As there were no quotations for foreign wheat, market sentiment was lackluster. November and December remained unchanged, January and February did not open, March decreased slightly by three cents, and April decreased slightly by one cent. However, during the afternoon session, November to February did not open. March and April benefited from a good flour market, with rumors of a certain factory making large purchases, which improved market sentiment. Nevertheless, continued transactions in foreign wheat at favorable standards inevitably exerted downward pressure. Consequently, March decreased slightly by one cent, while April increased by one cent.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Prices Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>丨Price Increase of 2.5 Cents丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a shift to better sentiment due to firm benchmark prices and a slight contraction in Dutch exchange rates. In addition, reports from Cuban telegrams indicated storm damage and potential losses in sugar production. As a result, the association's trading trends gradually tightened. No. 24 raw white sugar was priced at 14 taels and 8.5 cents, an increase of 2.5 cents from the previous day. Simultaneously, foreign firms also opened a batch of No. 24 raw white sugar spot goods following the trend. Huaxin sold 500 bags, and Changxing sold 1,700 bags, with prices matching the association's quotations. The quoted prices for No. 18 medium white sugar and Nos. 8, 9, and 10 Dutch red sugar remained unchanged. The market outlook has stabilized from weak due to an increase in incoming goods.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Glutinous Rice Branch Land Prices Rise</h3>
<p>丨Red Rice Sells Quickly Upon Arrival... Ordinary Goods Remain Popular丨</p>
<p>Glutinous rice branch: Recent arrivals of glutinous rice branches have been scarce, and the stock held by trading houses is also limited. As a result, the market outlook has entered a firm and stable position. According to letters from the production area, the procurement price has risen to 135 yuan, which translates to 85 or 86 taels in Shanghai, making it difficult to match offers. Therefore, there are few continued arrivals. Currently, high-grade glutinous rice branches in the market are selling for 80 taels, which is relatively cheap compared to other prices because these are goods that were acquired earlier with lower costs. Now that land prices have risen, the future market will inevitably follow higher.</p>
<p>▲Red Rice: Red rice was previously in short supply due to a milling shortage, and trading houses had long been out of stock. It is now known that various Chaozhou firms have recently received new shipments, which have been released in recent days. Top-grade "through-heart" red rice is priced at 29 taels, ke-grade red rice at 27 taels, and upper-middle grade at 23 or 24 taels. However, ordinary grades are selling better in the market because the northern river routes are about to freeze, leading to recent purchases. Prices have reached 18.5 taels, making them quite tight. Market stock is very scarce, and may need to be tightened further.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Customs Closure, Foreign Firms' Silk Market Inactive</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 12th) was the Premier's birthday, and the Jianghai Customs House was closed as usual. In addition, yesterday was the last day of the autumn races in the city and a Saturday. Most foreign firms were closed for the morning, and the foreign silk market was inactive.</p>
<h3>Overseas Silk Market Summary</h3>
<p>New York Italian Silk Imports Soar: The New York raw silk market has seen a surge in demand for high-quality Italian silk from silk mills due to the insufficient tensile strength of Japanese silk, which can easily break when used alone for silk weaving and must be mixed with raw silk from other countries. As a result, inventories are dwindling and imports are booming. The total quantity of Italian raw silk imported into New York last month (October) reached 2,851 bales, an increase of 1,931 bales compared to September.</p>
<p>▲US Raw Silk Sales Decline Last Month: The New York market was affected by the presidential election last month, and the silk market was sluggish, leading to a significant decrease in raw silk consumption. According to a telegram from the New York Silk Association yesterday, the total consumption of raw silk from China, Japan, Italy, France, and other countries in New York City last month (October) was 53,703 bales, a decrease of about 6,000 bales compared to September. Chinese silk and Italian silk each increased by 1,000 or 700-800 bales, while Japanese silk decreased by 7,797 bales.</p>
<p>▲Chinese Silk Prices Difficult to Rise in London: The London market has seen large shipments of Japanese silk products arriving, with exceptionally low selling prices, 50-60% cheaper than British factory products. This has resulted in a pile-up of goods in British silk mills and a significant decrease in raw silk consumption. Furthermore, the excessive dumping of cheap Japanese silk has made it difficult for Chinese silk prices to rise. The quoted price for top-grade white silk from factories is less than 600 taels per bale when converted to Chinese silver, and Tussah silk is only worth 550-560 taels.</p>
<h3>Ping-Shui Tea Actively Sold in the United States</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in this city saw renewed activity in the sale of Huzhou Ping-Shui green tea to the United States. The Jardine Matheson and China Tea companies purchased a total of more than 2,500 boxes at a selling price of 44-45 taels, which was slightly firmer than before. The sales of Lu-grade green tea were also quite active. There were sporadic transactions in Wuyuan Tunxi Zhenmei tea. Needle and Xiu mei teas have seen some activity in the French market recently, with transactions also being conducted via telegram. However, the opening market prices still show a downward trend with no rise.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Hardware Market Suddenly Sees a Rising Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the hardware market suddenly saw a rising trend. The reason is mostly due to the limited market supply and continuous customer sales. In addition, local factories in this street also need a lot of parts, and market conditions are exceptionally good. English steel plates, tinplate, new lead wire, small nails, ribbed steel, and new Yangguang goods have all increased in price, and sales are exceptionally brisk. It is reported that 6,000-7,000 dan were sold yesterday to customers from Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and the Yangtze River area.</p>
<h3>Pig Iron: Foreign Firms Already Active in Procurement</h3>
<p>Foreign firms have recently started procuring Hunan pig iron, and the market is more active than before. Prices are rising due to the limited arrivals. The current market price is estimated at 255 taels per ton, an increase of 5 taels from before, and the market has exceptionally limited spot goods with very good market sentiment.</p>
<h3>Tinplate: 5,000-6,000 Boxes Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>There are widespread rumors in the tinplate market that there is a shortage of goods, causing general buyers to lament that there is nothing to buy. Yesterday, New Taikoo Wharf received a new shipment of 5,800 boxes, attracting a large number of buyers and resulting in many transactions. It is reported that Ba opened more than 1,000 boxes. With continuous arrivals in the future, there should be no shortage panic in the market. However, it is also reported that the current spot goods of the Boxer Indemnity Committee still have more than 20,000 boxes unsold, which is a hindrance to price increases. Current market selling prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Pound Goods Taels Pound Goods Taels</p>
<p>90 English 10.75 90 American 14.0</p>
<p>100 English 11.75 100 American 21.50</p>
<p>180 English 21.00 180 American 28.00</p>
<p>200 English 21.75 200 American 31.50</p>
<p>25 Thin Plate 40.00</p>
<h3>Serge Twill Sells Actively</h3>
<p>Serge twill is a material specifically used for lining Western suits. Its sales are most brisk in the current cold weather. Domestic goods are also being produced, with a texture that is softer than imported goods and a silky, beautiful appearance because it is woven with rayon. Currently, a single-width bolt sells for 6.5 cents, and tailors who make Western suits are all buying it, which has greatly impacted imported goods. The selling price has fallen several times, and new orders from foreign firms have decreased sharply. Yesterday, the Serge twill market suddenly became very active, and the selling price rose again. The reason for the increase is the shortage of both arrivals and stock, with demand exceeding supply. Buyers are searching everywhere, causing the price to suddenly rise sharply. Wholesale discounts are 1 tael and 5 cents net per bolt, and retail is priced at 2.4-2.5 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>Riding Breeches Market Seen as Good</h3>
<p>The market atmosphere at the recently organized woolen fabric trade association is quite good, and sales are very lively. The market for riding breeches is even better, with the public selling price continuing to rise. Kongsi, Luxun, and Hualun riding breeches are all selling for 6 taels and 1 cent, and sales are extremely brisk. Because market stock is dwindling, buyers are rushing to purchase. Lower-grade goods from the Hualun brand are selling for 5 taels, but most of them are only quoted and not actually available. Rongtai goods are selling for 5 taels and 7 cents, an increase of more than 1 cent from last week. The popularity of riding breeches and overcoats is at its peak in the last two years.</p>
<h3>Coal: Boshan Coal Prices Unlikely to Improve</h3>
<p>丨Shanxi Coal Water Transport Fee Increases by 8 Cents per Ton丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, 300 tons of Boshan coal were traded. The nominal market price appeared to increase by 2.5 cents, but in reality, due to excessive coal inventories and the very active Japanese coal market, the actual price remained at 9 taels and 7.5 cents. More than 100 tons of Yuesheng coal were traded yesterday, but the market price did not improve, with sales at 10 taels per ton.</p>
<p>▲Shanxi white coal prices have been gradually rising recently, and it is reported that a large batch of new goods, about 4,000 tons, will be shipped in the next two to three days. It is said that the overall price will need to rise further, with screened lump coal needing to be 16 taels at the customs clearance and run-of-mine coal needing to be 15 taels. The reason for the firm prices is that the water transport fee for this shipment has increased by 8 cents per ton.</p>

<h3>Brand Awareness</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>|The Eighth of the Art of Living|</p>
<p>The ancients spoke of "choosing the capable and employing them," or "using talents appropriately," and so on. These sayings have now become a thing of the past and are no longer applicable. What is most applicable now is the phrase "brand awareness." The phrase "brand awareness" was probably invented in the lower classes of Shanghai, but it has become an abstract noun in all levels of society. It contains profound truths and can be applied everywhere, which is why it is so good.</p>
<p>Today I went to have a drink with some friends, but all the famous brands like "British Brand" and "Beijing Store" lamb cake and bean curd soup were associated with my friends. Yesterday I had a fight with Little Sanzi and suffered a great loss. Today I went to invite an old man, a "tycoon," to come out and show off a few connections to regain face. This is also a strong use of brand awareness. Therefore, the stronger the brand, the better, and the more, the better. With a brand, you don't have to worry about losing face.</p>
<p>This is the case in Shanghai society, and it is also the case in various associations. If you want to eat, you must first establish brand awareness. If you want to save face, you must also establish brand awareness. However, there are many levels of brand awareness. There is heavenly brand awareness, earthly brand awareness, human brand awareness, and personal brand awareness. In the past, the Ban family's "Table of People" was divided into nine ranks. Now, if we were to divide brand awareness into detail, there would be far more than nine ranks. Assuming that you are associated with heavenly brand awareness, you will naturally have inexhaustible wealth, foreign houses, and cars at your disposal. Even if you only have personal brand awareness, you won't have to worry about the seven necessities of life. Therefore, establishing brand awareness is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Puyi established brand awareness with the Japanese and became the ruler of a puppet state. His brand can be said to be strong, but he did not gain any real power and was at the mercy of the Japanese. Although his brand was strong, it was useless and he was merely scolded as a "puppet," a "traitor," and a cold-blooded animal. Our country has established brand awareness with the League of Nations, hoping to ask them for help, but it turned out to be a paper tiger. Although the surface is strong, it is actually not. After establishing it, there is still no sound or smell. The brand still cannot be established. This shows that establishing brand awareness is not an easy task. First, you must have a brand to establish, and then you must establish it properly for the brand to be useful.</p>
<p>Small brands establish brand awareness with big brands, and big brands establish brand awareness with particularly old brands. This is the only genuine, strong brand that cannot be divided. Establishing brand awareness back and forth is quite a sight to see.</p>

<h3>Simple and Easy-to-Make Small Toys</h3>
<p>— Ke Quan</p>
<p>Recently, I have been conducting experiments on the center of gravity and have successfully manufactured several physical instruments. These instruments are also children's toys. Usually, they are made of wax or wood. Schools buy these instruments for experiments, and each one costs more than one yuan. Children need to pay several jiao for small toys. However, most of these things still come from foreign countries. If we manufacture them ourselves, it will only cost two or three jiao. If we can utilize waste materials, we can even make them without spending a copper coin. Since this is the case, we should manufacture them ourselves. Why spend money to buy foreign goods? Therefore, I dare not keep my knowledge a secret and will now write down the simplest, easiest-to-make, and most easily successful methods below:</p>
<p>We only need to prepare an eggshell and a little soil to start making a roly-poly toy. When eating eggs, make a small hole in the small end and pour out the egg white and yolk. Then, take this unwanted eggshell, fill it with soil, and paste several layers of paper on top of the eggshell. Then, use a brush to draw eyes, ears, and whiskers on the tip. This will become a roly-poly toy.</p>
<p>This roly-poly toy can be made without spending any money. It can be used to study physics or as a children's toy. Put it on a table and it can rock and sway. This is the effect of the center of gravity because the upper part is light and the lower part is heavy.</p>
<p>To make a galloping horse, first use a wooden board that is about seven or eight inches long, four inches wide, and one inch thick. Draw a horse shape on it and use a narrow saw to cut it along the drawn lines. Then, drill a diagonal hole in the abdomen and install a thick iron wire in the hole. Tie a heavy object (such as a small brick or stone) to the lower end of the iron wire to make the horse's hind feet rest on a horizontal rod. If it is balanced, make a clay ball based on the weight of the heavy object and attach it to the iron wire. After this is done, make another wooden frame to support the horse's hind feet, and it will become a galloping horse.</p>
<p>When you press this galloping horse with your hand, it will move up and down and will not fall down. It is indeed a very interesting toy. The physics behind this is that the horse's hind feet are the fulcrum on the wooden frame, but its center of gravity is below the fulcrum, not on the iron wire, but in the air below the fulcrum, which is on the vertical line of the fulcrum. This proves that if the center of gravity of an object is below the fulcrum, it will not fall even if the center of gravity is small.</p>
<p>To make a one-legged man toy, the method is even easier than making a galloping horse. Use a wooden board that is about seven or eight inches long, three or four inches wide, and one inch thick. Draw a human shape on it and use a narrow saw to cut it out. Then, drill diagonal holes on the left and right sides of the waist and install iron wires in the holes. The iron wires should be about two inches longer than the feet. Attach clay ball weights to the ends of the iron wires. Each of the two clay balls should weigh about three or four liang. Then, use another iron wire to pass through the shin, allowing it to be supported by both hands. Tie some broken grass and other things to both ends of the iron wire to resemble a person carrying a load. Then, nail a small nail under its upright foot. Use another piece of wood, round or square, and drill a hole in the middle of the wood. Install a wooden pillar in the hole and place its upright foot on the wooden pillar. It will be able to stand up. This is a one-legged man.</p>
<p>When you put this one-legged man on the wooden pillar and push the upper part of its body, it will sway left and right but will not fall down. It is even more fun for children to play with. The physics behind this is that its center of gravity is below its feet, so it will not fall even if the fulcrum is small.</p>

<h3>Chinese Language Teacher</h3>
<p>— Xu Yu</p>
<p>While the students were sitting in the classroom, chatting and laughing merrily, Mr. Li, the impractical Chinese language teacher, walked in, carrying his lecture notes and striding with his splayed gait, causing everyone to feel disappointed.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Several young men in Western suits and fashionable young ladies all expressed their contempt and disgust on their faces. In particular, Miss Huang even pretended to be disgusted and nauseous, spitting on the ground and taking out her fragrant handkerchief to cover her nose and look away, as if she was afraid that Mr. Li's shabby air would contaminate her.</p>
<p>But Mr. Li was always "tireless in teaching." He lectured in great detail and with great enthusiasm, and shouted loudly, "Chinese language is the language of the national essence. Its culture is so long and ancient that it cannot be compared to any other country in the world. Yet you, the younger generation, now disregard Chinese studies and are absorbed in the crab-like Western language. You speak Western languages and write Western languages. Is this not abandoning yourselves and following others? How can this culture not be swept away...?"</p>
<p>Mr. Li lectured endlessly, with saliva flying everywhere, but "the speaker was earnest, the listeners were indifferent." It seemed as if they were completely unrelated. Some students only cared about looking down at "The Fate of Tears and Laughter" and other novels with great interest, while others were concentrating on writing love letters. What was especially funny was that some were lying on their desks, snoring loudly, as if they were playing rhythmic music, harmonizing with the teacher's lecture.</p>
<p>And Ms. Wu, who was well-versed in Li Hanhui's novels, drew a portrait of the teacher with the title "Mr. ×××'s Precious Photo" and passed it around for everyone to see, causing a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Li glared at the students, he finally "dared to be angry but dared not speak out." When the bell for the end of class rang, he hurried out of the classroom.</p>
<p>As a result, the silent and dreary classroom suddenly became lively again. Talking and laughing were heard everywhere. Miss Wang, who was dressed in Western clothes and exuded a Western air, was the first to refute the uselessness of Chinese studies, saying, "What is called 'national essence'? This is simply an outdated piece of junk. Otherwise, how could our Mr. Li, who is well-versed in the national essence and speaks nothing but 'zhi hu zhe ye,' be impoverished and sitting on the sidelines for the rest of his life? Sadly, his material reward is not even as good as that of an illiterate foreman."</p>
<p>Old Xu echoed, "That's right. It's the English language that has some prospects. Isn't our English teacher Mr. Liang's salary higher than Mr. Li's? Moreover, he also has a side job as a translator in a foreign company, earning several hundred yuan a month. This is so enviable..."</p>
<p>Just as he was speaking, Mr. Liang, the English teacher who aroused the envy of the students, arrived. He was wearing a very beautiful Western suit and carrying many gold-lettered Western books. He strode confidently to the podium. The students were all conquered by his extravagant Western air, and they all held their breath and listened attentively.</p>
<p>A Corner of Society</p>
<h3>A Proud Man in Embarrassment</h3>
<p>— Yong Jiong</p>
<p>The Value of a Match</p>
<p>I happened to meet Mr. Xu, whom I had not seen for many years, on ×× Road yesterday.</p>
<p>"Mr. Xu, long time no see, how are you?" I asked with a smile.</p>
<p>"Thank you, thank you," he replied with a nod and a smile.</p>
<p>After exchanging greetings, we stood and talked about our situations since our last meeting. According to him, he had just come from Nanjing. He told me a very interesting story, which I am now recording for the readers to read:</p>
<p>Today: I (Mr. Xu referring to himself) came on the early train, sitting in the first-class carriage. There were only me and a young man in a Western suit in the carriage. I felt very lonely and smoked a cigarette for entertainment, so I also put a box of matches on the table in front of me.</p>
<p>He looked alive, did not even say hello, reached out and took my matchbox, struck a match to light his cigarette, and then unceremoniously threw it back in front of me. At that time, I wanted to scold him, but after thinking carefully, I thought it would be better to pretend not to understand and use a trick to punish him.</p>
<p>When the train passed the ×× station, the train inspector had to check the tickets of the passengers to prevent any omissions. Just when they were checking my ticket, I pretended to be very calm and slowly opened the matchbox. "Huh! That's strange! My ticket was clearly hidden in this box, how could it be gone in an instant," I said, pretending to be very flustered.</p>
<p>He seemed to be taken aback, staring at me blankly without saying a word.</p>
<p>"There are only you and me in this carriage, no one else has come in. I seem to remember that you took my matchbox?" I asked, deliberately staring at him.</p>
<p>"I...I...I took it, but I didn't see the ticket," he replied, his face turning red instantly, stammering.</p>
<p>"The ticket was definitely hidden in this box, haha...joke...if no one took it, how could it be gone?" I pressed him further.</p>
<p>"Hurry, hurry, we have to go check elsewhere," the inspector urged impatiently.</p>
<p>"Okay...okay...I'll pay, I'll pay," he looked uneasy. He said to the inspector, "How much does it cost to replace a ticket?"</p>
<p>"In principle, a first-class ticket costs eleven yuan and one jiao. Now, if you want to replace the ticket, you will be fined double according to the regulations, for a total of twenty-two yuan and two jiao," the inspector replied pretentiously.</p>
<p>He gave the inspector the exact amount, replaced a ticket, and handed it to me. He looked very frustrated and stared out the window in a daze.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>The Patriotic Thief</h3>
<p>— Rui Yucheng</p>
<p>The darkness had swallowed the earth; everything was clothed in mysterious black, and clear outlines were indistinguishable; only the flickering streetlights opened their sleepy eyes, trembling in the permeating night.</p>
<p>It was already close to midnight, and a barking sound came from the alley; it turned out that a blurred figure was swaying at the foot of the wall. The dogs seemed to have a snobbish mentality, and barked more and more vigorously at the poorly dressed figure, until he tiptoed into the gate of a house.</p>
<p>The house was actually not a residence, but an office; several writing desks were placed haphazardly in the hall, with fruit peels and chestnut shells scattered on the surface. Books, newspapers, stationery, and other items were covered with thick dust, lying on the desk, sick. The portrait of the Premier hung on the wall facing the entrance, and the national flag and party emblem hung diagonally on both sides. Half of the will had been torn off, and its full text could not be seen.</p>
<p>The figure entering the gate was undoubtedly a thief. He took out a flashlight and turned it on for a moment, saw the Premier's portrait, and bowed respectfully three times. Then he listened carefully, and a snoring sound leaked out from the room on the west side. He first looked around the hall, but could not find any valuables, so he quietly slipped into the room.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the person who had fallen asleep made a mumbling sound, and the thief then imitated a few cat meows. After about a quarter of an hour, he came out with a large number of clothes, looking anxious. He placed the clothes on the table, took a breath, and then turned on the flashlight to inspect them; he saw that there was a national flag and a party emblem in the clothes, and he hesitated; finally, he seemed to resolutely decide to send the national flag and party emblem back into the room.</p>
<p>With a loud crash, something fell and awakened the sleeping owner, who shouted, "Someone! Thief!" Then there was the sound of striking a match and the sound of someone getting up, and finally the sound of the thief begging for mercy was heard.</p>
<p>"Ah, spare me! If I didn't respect the national flag and party emblem and send them back to you, I would have escaped long ago! Everything is outside, nothing is missing; the original items are returned, so please forgive me!" His voice was very straightforward, and it was determined that he was definitely not an ordinary thief.</p>
<p>"Nonsense! Lies! Do you even know how to love your country? Do you even know how to respect the national flag and party emblem? Let me tell you honestly, many of the gentlemen working here are serving the party and the country. Can you, a thief, really love your country...?" After a burst of words, there was the sound of hands and slaps coming into contact.</p>
<p>"Ouch, don't hit me, I am indeed telling the truth! I am not willing to be a thief, wasn't I a graduate of a senior high school? I only blame the fact that there is no place to eat in society, and I don't have any older sisters or younger sisters to marry rich people; seeing that I was about to starve to death, I fell to this point! In fact, what about the 'revolutionary doctrine' and 'knowledge of party principles'? What don't I know...?"</p>
<p>"I don't believe your lies either. Because you didn't steal anything, I'll spare you this time; if I catch you in my hands next time, you won't have a good life! Get out!"</p>
<p>He walked out the door in a melancholy manner, and two lines of hot tears were visible on his cheeks under the moonlight. The dogs' barking sent him out of the alley, and it is unknown where he went to seek his livelihood.</p>

<h3>An Appeal for Children</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifei</p>
<p>In Shanghai, our children are so pitiful. There isn't a single cinema established for children, nor a single film screened for them.</p>
<p>Movies were originally a powerful tool for education. We should fully utilize them to develop their educational function, complementing and enhancing school education. However, while the theory is such, the reality is clearly before our eyes. Although Shanghai has many towering cinemas, if we examine them carefully, we can say that not a single one has educational goals.</p>
<p>The films they show are either "sensual" or "supernatural," with the former being more prevalent. They merely serve as entertainment for adults of the "leisure class," neglecting both the performance of cinematic art and forgetting the educational function of movies. It is almost a miracle to make a film solely for education and for children. Therefore, in Shanghai, it's nearly impossible to find films worth watching for children. Children are either rejected at the door or suffer adverse effects after watching them.</p>
<p>Because of their love for their children, general parents often take their children with them to the cinema when they go, to watch films that are really not suitable for them. As a result, the parents increase their own guilt, staining the pure and flawless minds of their children. That is to say, children receive bad education from bad or unsuitable movies, which may affect them for life.</p>
<p>Now, progressive countries in the world, such as England, America, Japan, and the Soviet Union, pay great attention to the educational function of movies, so the establishment of children's cinemas and the screening of movies for children are very common. Should our China lag behind other countries in this regard?</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw in the newspaper that a children's cinema would be established in Shanghai. This may be true, or it may not become a reality. We can only wait for the future to confirm the truth of this news.</p>
<p>In short, in such a vast Shanghai society, there is a great need for movies for children.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Talking about "Born to Love"</h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>"Born to Love" is such a famous film, but after watching it, you might say, "It doesn't live up to its reputation." In reality, it is still a good film, but if our expectations for it are too high, we will find it bland.</p>
<p>The plot uses the European War as its background, following the same path as the silent "The Battlefield Flower" and the sound film "The Eagle Squadron." We have seen too many of these films, so we can't be too excited, which is also one reason why we find it bland. It tells the story of a woman whose lover goes to the battlefield, and the news of peace reaches London, but the news of her lover's death also reaches the woman's ears. She has no choice but to marry. Later, she has a child and learns that her lover is not dead, but has returned to England. Because of her husband's suspicion, she divorces, but her only beloved son is taken away by her husband, and her lover has already returned home. Soon, her lover returns a second time, but unfortunately, at the moment of their reunion, she gets her lover back, but her long-separated beloved son dies.</p>
<p>The story is like this. The first half is very loose, but the exciting part is entirely in the second half.</p>
<p>Constance Bennett is very good, for example, the scene of the divorce and the return of her lover both have very moving performances. Joel McCrea is also a good counterpart, but he has too few opportunities to perform. Paul Cavanagh plays a purely aristocratic Englishman and is very competent. The others have very few performances.</p>
<p>In many places, side writing and dark writing prove the director's skill and ability, which increases the power of the film. The photography and lighting are not bad, and there are several wonderful shots.</p>
<p>Constance's discovery of her son's death and the repeated pointing to the golden cross (a keepsake of their love) are both very noteworthy. The last few scenes are full of sorrow and gloomy fog, which further stimulates the music and gives the audience a deep stimulation when they leave.</p>
<p>This film seems too long, about more than 10,000 feet. There are many parts that can be cut, such as the description of the military hospital and the celebration of the peace memorial, which are extended to more than 300 feet, which is really too wasteful, while the European War Air Force is not filmed enough. The conclusion is that it is a very good film, but don't have high expectations before watching it.</p>

<h3>Preview of the Number of Films Produced by Countries Around the World in 1933</h3>
<p>— A Friend</p>
<p>The United States Still Leads</p>
<p>Italy Ranks Last</p>
<p>Russia Has Silent Films</p>
<p>Our Country Has No Preview</p>
<p>The preview of new films from various countries from 1932 to 1933, the total number of films that have been decided to be produced is more than 1,500, which is another new record.</p>
<p>(First) The United States is still the world's hegemon in terms of the number of films produced. The films that have been announced to be produced, including various independent film companies, are almost 700, and 550 have been confirmed.</p>
<p>(Second) It is said that Soviet Russia will produce 440 films. Only 100 of them are sound films, and the remaining 340 are silent films with dubbing. The reason why Soviet Russia still pays attention to the production of silent films is to sell them internationally.</p>
<p>(Third) Germany is the third, with 150 films budgeted, preparing to be produced next year.</p>
<p>(Fourth) The United Kingdom closely follows Germany, preparing to produce 140 films.</p>
<p>(Fifth) The French photography studio also plans to produce about 90 films.</p>
<p>(Sixth) Wealthy countries have also announced that they will produce 20 films.</p>
<p>In summary, there are a total of 1,540 films. Apart from the 340 silent films in Soviet Russia, the remaining 1,200 are ordinary feature films in one language. Other short films and all productions that have not been formally announced are not included. When it comes to our country, there is no such systematic budget at all. Perhaps it is "unnecessary to do this"! Therefore, it is of course impossible to know how many Chinese films there will be in the 22nd year of the Republic of China!</p>

<h3>Smart People Who Are High-Eyed and Low-Handed</h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>The American "screen idol" Valentino once said, "Every one of the stars on the screen today is a young man and woman who used to work hard." Friends! Don't be misled by those unachievable words, thinking that stars are made by a licentious and romantic life. You need to know that hoping to become a star without working hard is a lucky thing in the pioneering era. If you want to show your skills in the future photography studio, you must train yourself hard!</p>
<p>Some people laugh at you, ridicule you, saying that your practice is in vain. Don't be afraid of him. I tell you that this society is intolerant! This society is full of a group of smart people who only criticize others and never do anything themselves. These smart people know that they suffer from a common problem, which is "high-eyed and low-handed." Only by criticizing others can they show their "high eyes." Only by not doing it themselves can they cover up their "low hands." These smart people are jealous of people who are progressing! They will not sympathize with those who work hard! The reason why all our Chinese careers are not as good as those in the East and West is because there are too many smart people like this.</p>
<p>Comrades who love art! Let me tell you honestly! It was him who crucified Jesus! It was him who wanted to murder Columbus on the Atlantic Ocean! It was him who did not allow Newton to prove that the earth is round! It was also him who shouted to overthrow Watt, who used steam to drive the machine! He is jealous of people's success! He likes people to fail! This society is full of such devils!</p>
<h3>Silver Screen Star Dust</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>These days, the air in Hollywood is filled with a thicker "romance," although many couples in the film industry have broken up in divorce court.</p>
<p>The latest and most talked-about information is about Estelle Taylor and Lyle Talbot. Lyle Talbot is a very handsome new movie star. We can see the pair of them everywhere now, but they both deny having any plans to marry.</p>
<p>Since Sean Harlow married Paul Bern, Joan Marsh is now the most sought-after and beautiful new star in Hollywood. She is currently in love with Bick Powell, who is the most moving singer in Blessed Event (a new Warner film, probably not yet screened in Shanghai).</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin is currently immersed in a new love life. His object is the seductive Paulette Goddard. Do we want to see her? She will soon meet us in the new film "The Kid from Spain."</p>
<p>Tala Birell's recent fame is no less than that of Prince Ferdinand Lichtensteiu. Since the romantic history of Constance Bennett, Gloria Swanson, and Polax Negri was discovered, nothing has attracted more attention than her sacred love affair.</p>
<p>The sudden disappearance of Johnny Weissmuller and Luo Po Fan'er's love affair is just like their love, which broke out suddenly. Luo Po Fan'er vowed that she only favored one man, a prominent government official of a famous company, but the name has not been confirmed!</p>
<p>In the process of this pair of couples changing their love, people in Hollywood are stretching their necks, waiting for a season full of wedding events. At the same time, those stars who only want to be brides and not bridesmaids are hoping to get the first chair in preparing for many big weddings.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Racecourse Ballroom</h3>
<p>— Mai</p>
<p>The other day, Xuan Jinglin, Li Minghui, and Xu Lai, three modern women, danced wildly in a ballroom by the racecourse. This night was a special banquet hosted by Miss Zhang, a Shanghai socialite, inviting them to dance. At the same time, Mr. Yan Gongshang, a senior executive of the Star Film Company, was also present, dancing madly with the dancers. Although he is over half a century old, his enthusiasm for dancing surpasses that of young people. His long beard flutters, and his long gown sways as he steps to the beat at will. Xuan Jinglin saw him and called him "Godfather," and danced past him with others.</p>

<h3>Movie Star Milk Bath</h3>
<p>— Jieke</p>
<p>In the past, there was a baseless rumor in Shanghai that a concubine of our country's famous diplomat loved to take milk baths. It is said that milk baths have the effect of making the skin fair and the muscles plump. This rumor has never been verified. Now, movie stars in Hollywood are actually taking milk baths. We will soon be able to see it on the screen.</p>
<p>The scene of using movie stars to take baths to seduce the audience on the film was invented by the great director Cecil B. DeMille. For several years, he has made full use of this bath scene. Other directors have followed suit, adding a lot of color to the film. Recently, he even had the movie stars take milk baths, creating a new record in film history.</p>
<p>In DeMille's new film "The Sign of the Cross," there is a very large black marble Roman-style bath, filled with pure white milk. The movie star Claudette Colbert plays the licentious Roman Empress Poppaea, bathing in it. During the production, she floated in the milk bath naked for eight hours, creating the longest record for a bath scene in a film studio. However, it only lasts for a moment when it is shown on the screen.</p>
<p>When directing this bath scene, DeMille tried other white liquids, but they were not as good as milk in photography. Powder was probably harmful to Claudette's skin, so it was not used either. Later, 1,000 gallons of milk were poured into the huge Roman bath.</p>
<p>It is said that DeMille researched that Poppaea used donkey milk to bathe, so for the sake of authenticity, he also wanted to use donkey milk, but the audience could not tell the difference between donkey milk and milk, so he was a little careless.</p>
<p>Claudette is the first movie star to take a milk bath. She said that the women of ancient Rome were right, and milk baths do have a beautifying effect. After bathing in milk, she felt that her skin was soft and moisturized. Milk baths are too wasteful, she wants to use milk to wash her face and arms in the future.</p>
