<p>時評</p>
<h3>注意日軍之殘酷行動彬</h3>
<p>自上海禍變爆發以來。日軍在上海殘酷屠殺。造成世界大恐怖的景氣。據連日中西文報紙上的記載。和戰區難民的口述。如飛機遍處無目的的抛擲炸彈。任意轟炸民房居民。捕殺難民平民。如貫胸剖腹。剜眼割乳。截手斷足之事。不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>這是一筆血賬。而且這筆血賬。還正在日益增多。我們知道造成這一筆血賬的。不是拚着性命受人欺騙的日本士兵。也不是無能無力的日本國民。而只是日本殘暴的軍閥政客。和兇惡的浪人。在這一種兇惡的行爲之下已經澈底的揭破了所謂文明國家虚僞的面幕。從此我們可以知道一切「文明」「人道」「公理」與「正義。」都只是欺騙弱小民族的口號。而且正當日軍閥爲欲維持其殘喘。益努力於猛烈的進攻。故這次對於我們的屠殺。或正是太平洋上不可避免的狂風暴雨的開端。</p>
<p>我們基於正義與人道。對於這種殘酷的屠殺。特嚴重抗議我們認爲在二十世紀的人類社會。不容有這種野蠻暴行。以遺人類之羞辱。故我們此次已認淸這一筆血賬。實係日本軍閥政客及浪人所造成。當以堂堂正正之手段。向他們算賬。客覆其一切暴行。而對處於同一命運之日本國民。則我們决不效其慘酷行左。以相報酬。蓋我們一方始終抱定維護人道公理主義絶不能稍自違反。一方始終抱定盡力抵抗强暴以圖自存而决不稍有所畏縮。</p>
<p>日軍憑藉進可以攻退不必守之租界而後。日以砲火向我軍進攻。不足又肆其種種暴行戮及手無寸鐵之婦孺國際聯盟向對日本。委曲求全。不敢說一句强硬話。今亦義形於色。嚴詞提出抗議。蓋亦有見乎日人之蠻橫行動非特足以破壞和平。抑且摧殘世界公共之人道。倘日人於此日暮途窮之時。仍不回頭覺悟。尙想立足於今後的世界嗎。</p>
<p>上海事件</p>
<h3>敵軍大炮猛轟我軍還擊</h3>
<p>昨晨敵軍砲轟閘北</p>
<p>我軍還擊敵受重創</p>
<p>無淞昨無劇烈戰事</p>
<p>敵援到齊準備總攻</p>
<h3>閘北劇烈砲戰</h3>
<p>我砲隊昨晨開始還擊</p>
<p>轟燬敵防線損失奇重</p>
<p>閘北方面、雙方陣地、均築有堅固工事、敵以迭次衝鋒、均遭慘敗、故連日改用大砲轟擊、威嚇我、軍閘北廬舍、遂爲敵軍砲火下之犧牲品損失不可以估計、我軍深以敵之殘暴爲可恥、故迄未以重砲還擊、至前晚敵砲隊挑釁不已、我軍忍無可忍、爰亦發砲還擊、雙方砲戰至今晨八時始止、敵損失奇重、茲綜合各方關於閘北消息、分誌如次、</p>
<p>拂曉砲戰激烈前日下午四時十五分起、敵以重砲轟擊我閘北天通庵路八字橋一帶陣地、至十一時始漸停止、昨晨一時後、敵復以大砲射擊、時稀時密、致中興路永興路口一帶房屋、又被燬甚巨、至是我軍不能復忍、於昨晨二時十分起、開始以大砲還擊、至三時三十分雙方砲聲漸密、自四時十分至五時十間最爲激烈、每分鐘平均有三五砲、六時後砲聲極稀、至昨晨八時、雙方始停砲戰</p>
<p>敵軍損失奇重昨晨砲戰結果、我砲隊發砲異常準確、以日司令部爲目標、砲彈均中其要害、敵損失奇重、其第一二道防線、幾全爲我砲所轟燬、我軍乘勢進擊、陣地又有新擴展、又大美晚報云、昨日（十六）深夜至今日（十七）黎明、中日兩方之砲單、結果、公共租界與界外馬路、死中國平民五人、又傷十六人、房屋受損者四十所、此爲今日下午所確悉者、其不能查明者、尙不知凡幾也、今晨三時起、至六時止、日軍陣線後之損失、</p>
<p>、共値數萬元、蓋華軍第一次用開花彈猛轟日軍陣地也、</p>
<p>江灣路敵敗退昨晨六時許、在江灣路之敵軍約四五十名、藉大砲之掩護、又作衝鋒戰、一時槍聲大起、砲轟不絶、雙方相持約半小時、敵不支敗退、據軍事家之推測、敵軍之衝鋒、似係試探我江灣方面之軍力也、</p>
<p>中校科長楊繼章氏</p>
<h3>寳興坊昨大火</h3>
<p>昨晨三時許、閘北中興路寳興坊、被日軍開砲百餘響、開花砲彈落地炸裂起火、火光獨天、因無人救火、該處四區公安局中興路派出所、恐有流氓槍刦、警長羅明啓程鈞陳茂修等、皆到塲維持、前天、共各新路（中興路南）被日飛機擲下炸彈數枚、一彈在該路之東旁炸裂、馬路毁壞三丈餘、炸彈毁壞之處、已成大水潭、潭深一丈餘、水管亦炸斷、故該處自來水已斷絶、昨日下午、見水管中有水汨汨流出、就近住民咸向潭中汲水炊餐、故寳興坊一帶、完全斷水、致所有房屋延燒殆盡、共計市住房、約有二百餘間云、</p>
<h3>吳淞昨日戰况</h3>
<p>張華浜敵軍退縮</p>
<p>寳山被敵艦砲轟</p>
<p>敵軍數次向我吳淞要塞總攻均遭失敗乃兩日來、一面等待援軍、一面在張華浜附近一帶、趕築防禦工事、預備援軍齊集後、再行大舉進攻、故前昨兩日、僅不時開放大砲及機槍、並派遣飛機偵察擲彈、向我軍示威、有時亦以小隊步兵襲擊、但結果終被我軍擊退、至於敵方之軍艦、現均停泊吳淞口外及白龍港一帶、每日在潮水高漲時、即向我開砲、但我軍在防綫内靜守、毫不爲動、同時非待敵軍進到相當地點時、决不消耗一彈也、茲將昨日吳淞及薀藻浜一帶之戰况、與敵軍之行動、以及其他各種情狀、分紀如後、</p>
<p>敵艦昨砲攻寳山停泊寳山東門外海面之二日艦、昨日上午、突向寳山方面開放大砲七八發、轟擊城市、故南門金伯賢宅鮑思仁宅、均中砲彈炸燬、又吳淞大火焚燒二日一、夜直至昨晨一時始熄、東鎭南昌路廟弄文昌路等處市房、均已化爲灰燼、七區公安總署沿浦之房屋、前次已被敵艦砲毁、所有剩餘後進房屋、此次亦已焚毁無存矣、七區全體官警、自敵進攻薀藻浜、即經區長趙澤周率領、並將公文案卷械彈遷至楊行暫駐、</p>
<p>鼎興沙發現日軍吳淞口外、現泊有敵艦七艘、均距砲臺火綫甚遠、昨晨八時許、有敵兵約二十餘人、乘小划二艘、駛至口外鼎興沙登岸、該沙農民、瞥見敵兵、大爲驚駭、相率棄家奔逃、匿於遠處蘆　中、敵兵見農民逃逸、即向各處農家搜刦米糧、並在田間拔割菜蔬、屑挑背、負滿載下船、向敵艦而去、該處農民、於敵兵去後、方敢返家、農民之稍有資產者、深恐敵兵再來騷擾、業已棄家、紛乘民船、逃往崇明海門及高橋等處逃避矣、</p>
<p>敵攻孫家宅失敗盤據張華浜附近之敵軍、於十六日晚間十時許、突有步兵一大隊、向孫家宅夏家橋之我軍防綫攻擊、我軍初時靜伏壕内、沉着不應、</p>
<p>、俟其密集隊進到相當地點後、乃齊入來福槍機關槍、及擲手溜彈掃射、奮勇迎擊、互戰約五六小時、直至昨晨二時餘、始將敵軍全部解决、我軍亦即乘勝挺進、該處敵軍、已退縮至錢家浜侯家木橋等處駐紥、</p>
<p>水兵偷渡被擊退昨晨四時許、天將拂曉之際、有敵海軍陸戰隊百餘名、分乘敵艦小划船四艘、由一灰色小汽油船拖帶、由吳淞口外駛進三夾水、希圖在海岸巡防處前面濬浦局所築之石梗、（即分水堤）偷渡登陸、製擊砲台、當被我岸上防軍覺察擊退、詎是時停靠糧米站碼頭前之敵艦、因聞砲台灣一帶突起緊密之槍聲、遂發砲向該方轟擊、不意砲彈非特未傷我軍、竟誤中敵之小划一艘、斃敵兵二十餘人、餘划亦險遭不測敵兵當疑係被我軍擊沉、以形勢不佳、小汽油船、遂急行拖帶小划三艘、向口外駛逃而去、</p>
<p>、又停泊於張華浜糧米站碼頭之敵艦、每晚放射探海燈、照耀我軍各陣地、澈夜不絶、</p>
<p>張華浜敵築砲台昨據報告、敵軍連日在張華浜附近趕築砲台一座、四圍用水泥造成、上架大小砲各數尊、砲口對準薀藻浜陸家宅兩處、又張華浜車站西軍工路之左邊、自十六日起、設有野砲七尊、砲口亦向西北方面、敵軍之前敵指揮官均在車站附近之民房内、又據張華浜西唐家橋逃出之居民云、日軍現駐重兵於肇家浜丁家橋一帶云、</p>
<p>昨晨敵機擲炸彈㈠昨晨有日飛機四架、由江灣方面向西至大塲鎭時見有我軍出入、該機遂抛擲百念磅重量炸彈兩枚、一彈未爆、一彈則落於西市之前爆烈、炸成大洞並將傍側之老樹一粿、連根拔起、竪立泥土中、石柱兩根、亦被轟起、飛過雷祖殿及居民樓房五六幢、落於田内、故未傷人、㈡昨日忽有日飛機四五架、盤旋於該鎭天空、或開放機關槍轟擊、或抛擲炸彈、因而該鎭房屋坍塌者有之、傾倒者有之、或全毁無遺、或祇損一角、惟鎭前落有大炸彈四枚三彈未爆、㈢十六午後五時許、吳淞鎭東後街文昌路一帶天空忽來日飛機一架、抛擲炸彈、該處落一硫磺彈、當即爆發、以致延燒房屋、火勢燎原不可收拾、加之無人援救、因此向東延燒、直至昨晨、始行熄滅共計被焚去市房百餘間之多</p>
<p>敵機受傷後逃逸昨日攻吳淞之敵飛機一架、右面下翼、被我軍用高射砲擊壞、機師腰部亦受傷、勉强飛歸敵機塲下落、但已損壞不能使用、</p>
<p>敵軍飛機之調查大美晚報云、今晨（十七日）日軍仍在自楊樹浦起越江灣區至吳淞止之陣線佈置一切、故未有戰事、僅偶有機關槍與來福槍聲、今日所可注意者、爲日陸軍飛機九架已運登岸上、日軍陣線已向江灣方面擴張、日軍在正向跑馬塲移動、聞曾與中國哨兵以來福槍交轟、今日聞日軍循翔殷河前進者、已將懸掛美旗之民生雞塲佔據、華軍已將通江灣之各橋樑炸斷、日軍現又在上海方面築造飛機塲一所、此爲開戰以來所築之第三飛機塲、近二十四小時内、日飛機已見增多、在今晨計之、共有大轟炸機十六架、追逐機十架、另有九機、今晨向虹口方面飛去、因飛行太高、不能辨明其陸軍式、抑海軍式、</p>

<h3>Note on the Cruel Actions of the Japanese Army in Bin</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, the Japanese army has been cruelly massacring people in Shanghai, creating a scene of great terror worldwide. According to reports in Chinese and Western newspapers over the past few days and the accounts of refugees from the war zone, airplanes indiscriminately drop bombs everywhere, arbitrarily bombing civilian houses and residents, and killing refugees and civilians. Acts such as piercing chests, dissecting abdomens, gouging out eyes, cutting off breasts, severing hands, and breaking feet are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>This is a debt of blood, and this debt of blood is increasing daily. We know that those responsible for this debt of blood are not the Japanese soldiers who risk their lives and are deceived, nor the powerless Japanese people, but only the brutal Japanese military and political leaders and the vicious rogues. These vicious actions have completely exposed the hypocritical facade of so-called civilized nations. From this, we can understand that all "civilization," "humanity," "justice," and "righteousness" are merely slogans to deceive weak nations. Just as the Japanese military leaders are striving to maintain their last breath, they are intensifying their fierce offensive. Therefore, this massacre of our people may be the beginning of an inevitable storm on the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Based on justice and humanity, we strongly protest against this cruel massacre. We believe that such barbaric acts should not be allowed in the human society of the 20th century, leaving a disgrace to humanity. Therefore, we have now clearly recognized that this debt of blood was created by Japanese military and political leaders and rogues. We will settle accounts with them in a dignified manner and retaliate against all their atrocities. As for the Japanese people who share the same fate, we will never imitate their cruel acts in return. On the one hand, we are always determined to uphold humanitarian principles and never violate them. On the other hand, we are always determined to resist violence to survive and never shrink back in the slightest.</p>
<p>Relying on the concessions where they can attack but not need to defend, the Japanese army daily uses artillery to attack our army. Moreover, they carry out all kinds of atrocities, killing innocent women and children. The League of Nations has always tried to appease Japan and dared not say a single harsh word. Now, it also expresses its indignation and strongly protests, as it sees that the Japanese's barbaric actions are not only sufficient to destroy peace but also to devastate the common humanity of the world. If the Japanese, at this time of desperation, still do not turn around and realize their mistakes, do they still want to have a foothold in the world in the future?</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Enemy Artillery Shells Our Army Fiercely; Our Army Retaliates</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, enemy artillery shelled Zhabei.</p>
<p>Our army retaliated, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.</p>
<p>No fierce fighting in Wusong yesterday.</p>
<p>Enemy reinforcements arrive, preparing for a general offensive.</p>
<h3>Fierce Artillery Battle in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Our artillery began to retaliate yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Destroying enemy defense lines and inflicting heavy losses.</p>
<p>In the Zhabei area, both sides have built solid fortifications. The enemy's repeated offensives have all resulted in disastrous defeats. Therefore, they have changed to using artillery bombardment to intimidate our army. The residences in Zhabei have become victims of enemy artillery fire, and the losses are incalculable. Our army deeply shames the enemy's brutality, so we have not retaliated with heavy artillery. Until the enemy artillery provoked us relentlessly the night before, our army could no longer endure it and also fired artillery in retaliation. The artillery battle between the two sides lasted until 8:00 AM this morning. The enemy suffered heavy losses. The following is a comprehensive summary of the news from all sides regarding Zhabei, divided as follows:</p>
<p>Fierce Artillery Battle at Dawn: Starting from 4:15 PM the day before yesterday, the enemy used heavy artillery to bombard our positions in the area of Tiantong'an Road and Baziqiao in Zhabei, gradually stopping at 11:00 PM. After 1:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy resumed artillery fire, sometimes sporadically and sometimes densely, causing the houses along Zhongxing Road and Yongxing Road to be heavily damaged again. Thereupon, our army could no longer endure it and began to retaliate with artillery starting at 2:10 AM yesterday morning. From 3:30 AM, the sound of artillery gradually intensified, and it was most intense from 4:10 AM to 5:10 AM, with an average of three to five shells per minute. After 6:00 AM, the sound of artillery was extremely sparse, and the two sides stopped the artillery battle at 8:00 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses for the Enemy: As a result of yesterday morning's artillery battle, our artillery fired extremely accurately, targeting the Japanese headquarters. The shells all hit their vital points, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. Their first and second lines of defense were almost completely destroyed by our artillery. Our army took advantage of the situation to attack, and the positions were further expanded. Also, the Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that yesterday (16th) late at night until today (17th) at dawn, as a result of the artillery shells of both the Chinese and Japanese sides, five Chinese civilians were killed and sixteen were injured on the public concession and the roads outside the concession. Forty houses were damaged. This is what was confirmed this afternoon, and the number that cannot be ascertained is still unknown. From 3:00 AM to 6:00 AM this morning, the losses behind the Japanese army lines amounted to tens of thousands of yuan, because the Chinese army used shrapnel for the first time to bombard the Japanese army positions fiercely.</p>
<p>Enemy Retreats on Jiangwan Road: At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, about forty or fifty enemy soldiers on Jiangwan Road, under the cover of artillery, launched another assault. The sound of gunfire rose sharply for a time, and the artillery bombarded continuously. The two sides held each other for about half an hour, and the enemy retreated in defeat. According to military experts' speculation, the enemy's assault seemed to be testing the military strength of our army in the Jiangwan area.</p>

<h3>Major Fire in Baoxingfang Yesterday</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, Baoxingfang on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei was shelled by the Japanese army with over a hundred shells. The shrapnel exploded upon landing and ignited a fire. The fire blazed brightly into the sky. Because no one was fighting the fire, the Zhongxing Road Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau feared that hooligans would loot with guns. Police Chief Luo Mingqi, Cheng Jun, Chen Maoxiu, and others all arrived at the scene to maintain order. The day before yesterday, several bombs were dropped by Japanese planes on Gongge Xin Road (south of Zhongxing Road). One bomb exploded next to the road to the east, destroying more than three zhang of the road. The place where the bomb exploded has become a large pool of water, more than one zhang deep. The water pipe was also blown off, so the water supply in that area has been cut off. Yesterday afternoon, water was seen gurgling out of the water pipe, and nearby residents drew water from the pool to cook their meals. Therefore, the water supply in the Baoxingfang area has been completely cut off, causing all the houses to be burned to the ground. It is estimated that there were about two hundred houses in the city.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Wusong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops Retreating from Zhanghuabang</p>
<p>Baoshan Bombed by Enemy Warships</p>
<p>The enemy army's several general offensives towards our Wusong Fortress have all failed. For the past two days, on the one hand, they have been waiting for reinforcements, and on the other hand, they have been rushing to build defensive fortifications near Zhanghuabang, preparing for a major offensive after the reinforcements have gathered. Therefore, in the past two days, they have only occasionally fired artillery and machine guns and dispatched airplanes to scout and drop bombs to demonstrate to our army. Sometimes, they also launch attacks with small squads of infantry, but the result is always being repelled by our army. As for the enemy warships, they are currently anchored outside the Wusong Estuary and the Bailonggang area. Every day when the tide rises, they fire artillery at us, but our army remains stationed inside the defense line and does not move. At the same time, we will not expend a single bullet until the enemy army advances to a considerable point. The following is a record of the battle situation in the Wusong and Yunzaobang areas yesterday, the enemy army's actions, and other various situations, divided as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy Warships Bombed Baoshan Yesterday: Two Japanese warships anchored off the east gate of Baoshan yesterday morning suddenly fired seven or eight artillery shells at the Baoshan area, bombarding the city. As a result, the residences of Jin Boxian and Bao Siren in the south gate were hit by artillery shells and destroyed. Also, the fire in Wusong burned for two days and one night until 1:00 AM yesterday morning. The city houses in Dongzhen, Nanchang Road, Miaonong, and Wenchang Road have all been reduced to ashes. The buildings along the Pu River of the Seventh District Public Security Headquarters were previously destroyed by enemy warships, and all the remaining rear buildings have also been burned down this time. All the officers and police officers of the Seventh District, since the enemy attacked Yunzaobang, have been led by District Chief Zhao Zezhou and have temporarily moved the official documents and ammunition to Yangxing for temporary residence.</p>
<p>Discovery of Japanese Troops on Dingxing Sand: There are currently seven enemy warships anchored outside the Wusong Estuary, all far from the artillery fire line. At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, about twenty enemy soldiers rode two small boats to the shore of Dingxing Sand outside the estuary. The farmers on the sand, glimpsing the enemy soldiers, were greatly alarmed and abandoned their homes, fleeing and hiding in the reeds in the distance. Seeing the farmers fleeing, the enemy soldiers searched the farmers' homes for rice and vegetables, picked and carried them on their backs, and loaded them onto the boats, heading towards the enemy warships. After the enemy soldiers left, the farmers dared to return home. Those farmers with a little property are deeply afraid that the enemy soldiers will come to harass them again, and they have already abandoned their homes and boarded civilian boats, fleeing to Chongming, Haimen, Gaoqiao, and other places to escape.</p>
<p>Enemy Attack on Sunjiazhai Fails: The enemy troops entrenched near Zhanghuabang, at around 10:00 PM on the 16th, suddenly had a large detachment of infantry attacking our army's defense line at Sunjiazhai and Xiajiaqiao. Our army initially lay hidden in the trenches, calmly not responding.</p>
<p>, waiting for their densely packed troops to advance to a considerable point, then all fired rifles, machine guns, and threw grenades to sweep and bravely counterattack, fighting each other for about five or six hours, until 2:00 AM yesterday morning, when the entire enemy army was resolved. Our army also took advantage of the victory to advance. The enemy troops in that area have retreated to Qianjiabang, Houjia Wooden Bridge, and other places to camp.</p>
<p>Sailors Attempting to Cross Were Repelled: At around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, as dawn was breaking, more than a hundred enemy naval marines, divided into four small boats on enemy warships, towed by a small gray gasoline boat, sailed from outside the Wusong Estuary into Sanjiashui, hoping to land secretly on the stone embankment (i.e., the dividing dike) built by the Junpu Bureau in front of the Coast Guard Office and capture the fort. They were detected and repelled by our shore defense forces. Unexpectedly, at that time, the enemy warships docked in front of the grain station pier, hearing the sudden dense sound of gunfire from the vicinity of the Fort Taiwan, fired artillery to bombard that side. Unexpectedly, the artillery shells not only did not injure our army but actually mistakenly hit one of the enemy's small boats, killing more than twenty enemy soldiers. The remaining boats were also in danger. The enemy soldiers suspected that they had been sunk by our army. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the small gasoline boat hastily towed the three small boats and fled towards the estuary.</p>
<p>, and the enemy warships anchored at the Zhanghuabang grain station pier shine searchlights every night, illuminating our army's positions throughout the night.</p>
<p>Enemy Builds Fort at Zhanghuabang: According to reports yesterday, the enemy army has been rushing to build a fort near Zhanghuabang for several days, made of cement on all sides, with several large and small artillery pieces mounted on it, the muzzle pointing at Yunzaobang and Lujiazhai. Also, on the left side of the Xijungong Road of Zhanghuabang Railway Station, there have been seven field artillery pieces since the 16th, with the muzzle also pointing to the northwest. The advance commanding officers of the enemy army are all in the civilian houses near the railway station. Also, according to residents who escaped from Xitangjiaqiao in Zhanghuabang, the Japanese army is currently stationed with heavy troops in the Zhaojiabang and Dingjiaqiao areas.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Drop Bombs Yesterday Morning: 1. Yesterday morning, four Japanese planes flew from the Jiangwan area westward to Dachangzhen. Seeing our army coming in and out, the planes dropped two hundred-pound bombs. One bomb did not explode, and one fell in front of the West Market and exploded, blasting a large hole and uprooting an old tree beside it, standing it upright in the soil. Two stone pillars were also blown up, flying over the Leizu Temple and five or six residential buildings, falling in the field, so no one was injured. 2. Yesterday, four or five Japanese planes suddenly circled in the sky over the town, either firing machine guns or dropping bombs. As a result, some houses in the town collapsed, some tilted, some were completely destroyed, and some were only damaged in one corner. However, four large bombs fell in front of the town, and three of them did not explode. 3. At around 5:00 PM on the 16th, a Japanese plane suddenly came to the sky above Wenchang Road in the Donghou Street area of Wusong Town and dropped a bomb. A sulfur bomb fell there and exploded immediately, causing the houses to catch fire, and the fire spread uncontrollably. In addition, no one came to rescue, so it spread eastward and did not extinguish until yesterday morning. A total of more than a hundred houses in the city were burned down.</p>
<p>Enemy Plane Damaged and Escaped: Yesterday, an enemy plane attacking Wusong had its right lower wing damaged by our army's anti-aircraft guns, and the pilot's waist was also injured. He barely managed to fly back to the enemy airfield and landed, but it was damaged and could not be used.</p>
<p>Investigation of Enemy Planes: The Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that this morning (17th), the Japanese army is still arranging everything on the line from Yangshupu across the Jiangwan area to Wusong, so there was no battle, only occasional machine gun and rifle fire. What is noteworthy today is that nine Japanese army planes have been transported ashore. The Japanese army's line has expanded towards the Jiangwan area. The Japanese army is moving towards the racecourse and is said to have exchanged rifle fire with Chinese sentries. Today, it was heard that the Japanese army advancing along the Xiangyin River has occupied the Minsheng Chicken Farm, which was flying the American flag. The Chinese army has blown up the bridges leading to Jiangwan. The Japanese army is now building an airfield in Shanghai, which is the third airfield built since the start of the war. In the past 24 hours, the number of Japanese planes seen has increased. This morning, there were sixteen large bombers, ten pursuit planes, and another nine planes that flew towards Hongkou this morning. Because the flight was too high, it was impossible to distinguish whether they were army or navy planes.</p>

<p>The Current Situation of the Wusong Waterway: The navigation route of the Wusong Estuary has been obstructed since the lighthouse was destroyed by Japanese artillery. Regarding the situation of the Wusong Waterway, the following is the result of the reporter's investigation: 1. The lighthouse is damaged and cannot navigate at night. The Jianghai Customs outside the Wusong Estuary has set up a lighthouse to indicate the channel for merchant ships entering and exiting, which is to guide the ships coming and going to avoid reefs and shallows, which is the compass of Shanghai's navigation and is of great importance to maritime safety. When Japanese warships bombarded Wusong, they suddenly destroyed the lower end of the lighthouse with artillery the day before yesterday, and most of the tower body collapsed. The warning light on the top has also been extinguished. During daytime navigation, each ship can still see this remaining tower as a standard. Once at night, the waterway traffic is completely cut off due to the destruction of the tower, because merchant ships have no way to travel back and forth. 2. All Japanese pilots are conscripted for military use. Shanghai has pilots divided into Westerners, Japanese, and Chinese, and each has its own association. When the Japanese troops came to Shanghai and the warships entered the port this time, if our country could have recovered the right to pilot the river earlier, how could they have entered? This time, at the beginning of the war, the Japanese pilots in this port were all hired by the Japanese navy and stationed on various warships and transport ships for long-term military use, so they can come and go freely in the Wusong Estuary. 3. Yesterday, Japanese warships traveled to and from Wusong and Shanghai. There were a total of twenty-three Japanese warships outside the Wusong Estuary yesterday, including thirteen stationed between Bailonggang and Apo Sha, and ten ships from Shitousha to the Wusong Estuary. The muzzles of each Japanese warship were aimed at our fort when the tide was high, and when the water fell, the ship's body was horizontal, and the muzzles of each cannon were scattered in all directions. Yesterday, those entering Shanghai from outside Wusong included twenty-two ships in Team Three at 9:10 AM and twenty-six ships in Team Two at 11:15 AM. There was one ship in Team Two leaving the port at 3:00 PM. 4. Searchlights illuminate our merchant ships. Merchant ships that came to Shanghai yesterday included the Ningbo steamer Xing Shi and other ships. Each ship was anchored outside Wusong, waiting for dawn before entering. The Japanese warships in Wusong once searched Chinese ships the day before yesterday. Yesterday, each Japanese warship did not search or inspect our national Shanghai-Ningbo steamers arriving in Shanghai, but only used searchlights to illuminate each merchant ship. At around 8:00 AM, the Anning Xing Shi and other Ningbo steamers successively entered the Huangpu River without danger. 5. Jiangbei workers concentrated at the Huishan Wharf. Huishan, Huangpu, and other wharves have become the concentration point for Japanese military transportation. Yesterday, a certain ship passed the Jiang surface outside the wharf and saw a large number of Jiangbei workers, about four or five hundred, led by a worker, entering the iron gate. Later, a certain gentleman learned through detailed investigation that these Jiangbei people were hired by them, paid two yuan a day, and were sent to the battlefield to dig trenches, and the Japanese selected them very strictly. Only three hundred out of five hundred people were selected and escorted away by the Japanese. Such workers who are greedy for profit and betray the country are truly hateful.</p>
<h3>Stray Bullets Injured People Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Intensity of Japanese Artillery Fire</p>
<p>From the night before last night until yesterday morning, the Japanese army repeatedly used artillery to bombard our army. Stray bullets flew to the public concession and the French concession, destroying houses and killing and injuring many people. In the Zhabei area, such as Zhongxing Road and Gonghe Xin Road, houses in the area caught fire one after another after being hit by enemy bullets. As of yesterday afternoon, the fire had not yet been extinguished. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Major Fire on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei: A residential house next to Zhongfuli on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei was set on fire at 7:30 AM yesterday due to the explosion of enemy artillery shells, and more than ten houses were burned. As of 3:00 PM, the embers had not yet been extinguished. Also, houses in the area of Song Park Road, Gonghe Xin Road, Yongxing Road, and Hanqiao also caught fire after being hit by bullets.</p>
<p>Stray Bullets Fly to North Zhejiang Road: The Yuanheguan Restaurant at No. 240 and 41 at the corner of North Zhejiang Road and Haining Road was struck by stray bullets from the roof yesterday morning, shattering seven glass windows upstairs, and crossing the road, breaking the glass windows of the Lu Yongchang Shoe Store at No. 450. Fortunately, none of the employees of the two stores were injured. The area is under the jurisdiction of the Huizi Patrol Station, so the patrol station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate after hearing the report.</p>
<p>Many People Injured by Bombing on Yuanfang Road: Several artillery shells flew to Yuanfangli on Yuanfang Road in Hongkou at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, killing two residents and injuring seven. The names are as follows: Deceased: Wang Jing, 50 years old, Yu Liancheng, 17 years old. Injured: Zhang Liu Shi, 44 years old, Zhu Hongkui, 27 years old, Zhang Kangmai, 14 years old, Fu Wulin, 16 years old. All of the above are Ningbo people, with injuries to the head and face. Gu Ansan, 15 years old, Jiang Wang Shi, 47 years old, Fang Renlin, 29 years old. All of the above are Jiangbei people, with injuries to the head, face, shoulders, hands, etc.</p>
<p>Stray Bullets on Xiangyan Bridge in Hongzhen: Several artillery shells fell on Xiangyan Bridge in Hongzhen yesterday morning, injuring five people. The names are as follows: Xie Xiaowu's son was injured in the shoulder, Ding Si was injured in the leg, Chen Zhao Shi was injured in the leg, Yang Desheng was injured in the chest, Wang Chen Shi was injured in the shoulder.</p>
<p>Artillery Shells Kill Two Japanese Soldiers: An artillery shell landed at No. 187, North Sichuan Road, the Park Motor Company, at around 4:30 AM yesterday morning. Two Japanese soldiers were inside, one was killed on the spot, and one was injured in the leg.</p>
<p>The Disaster Spreads to the Shanghai West Area: An artillery shell landed on the roof of the residence of a Mr. Liu at No. 1264, Xiaoshadu Road, Lubersheng Road, Shanghai West, at around 4:00 AM yesterday morning and exploded on the spot, injuring a tenant, Fan Li Shi, in the head. Another person, Jiang Shixin, was also injured in three places on his left hand, right leg, and waist. Also, Lu Shouxing, an employee of the Dalun Foreign Goods Store across from the Pan Yitai Rice Store north of the Big Ben clock on Lubersheng Road, was also hit by stray bullets on his shoulder and other places. A shrapnel fell on an open space next to Yuqingli on the same road, creating a deep pit of several feet.</p>
<p>Damage to Residences on Wagenaar Road: At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, a small artillery shell suddenly exploded on the roof next to the sun deck of Dr. Yu Meifang's building at No. 249, Ren'anfang, Wagenaar Road. The sound of the explosion was very loud at the time, and the residents on the left and right were panicked. The roof tiles were blown away, forming a large hole the size of a square table. Fortunately, no one was injured. The Special District Court's Precautions: After the glass window of the office of Judge Wu Tingqi on the fourth floor of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court was shattered by stray bullets the day before yesterday, the court ordered workers to carry sandbags to the fourth and fifth floors to block the glass windows everywhere as a precaution yesterday morning, leaving only a small gap to allow air to circulate. With this precaution, even stray bullets are not enough to cause harm.</p>
<p>Tragedy at the Peace Memorial Monument: The Continental Daily reported that a Chinese man surnamed Wang, after escaping from Zhabei, was looking for his wife who had escaped earlier but could not find her. He sat down to rest in front of the Peace Memorial Monument at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII. Suddenly, a stray bullet flew from the Hongkou area and hit him in the head, causing him to fall to the ground and die. It was truly a tragedy.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Run Rampant</h3>
<p>Reconnoitering Military Situation and Randomly Dropping Bombs</p>
<p>Affecting Innocent People and Refugees</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers dispatched a total of six reconnaissance planes and bombers at 7:00 AM yesterday, circling around the Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei areas, hoping to reconnoiter our army's situation and bomb civilian houses. The planes were divided into two teams, each team with one reconnaissance plane and two bombers. The reconnaissance planes flew very low. Because they were swept by our army's rifles, they circled for several weeks and flew towards the Zhenru area in the northwest without dropping bombs. However, when they reached Zhenru, they were forced back by our army. At around 1:00 PM, two Japanese planes flew to Liuhang again and dropped more than ten bombs in the town. Only one bomb exploded and was repelled by our army's rifles. In the Jiangwan and Wusong areas, Japanese planes were afraid of being bombed by our army, so they flew extremely high and did not stay. It seems that their intention was to reconnoiter our army's movements, but in the end, they gained nothing. Also, it was reported that four Japanese planes arrived in Liuhang Town on Hutai Road at around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon and dropped more than ten bombs, none of which exploded. One bomb fell into a fish pond, making a loud noise. The carp raised in the pond were all killed by the explosion. They also flew to Luodian and dropped several bombs. One bomb fell on the roof of a certain family's ancestral hall in the town and exploded, and several refugees inside were killed.</p>
<h3>Sympathetic Remarks from the North China Daily News on China</h3>
<p>The Bravery of Chinese Soldiers is Astonishing</p>
<p>Admirable Good National Character</p>
<p>The North China Daily News published a short commentary yesterday, saying that in recent times, various parties have been commenting on the major events that have occurred in the past one or two weeks, perhaps neglecting the emotions aroused in the hearts of the Chinese people after the resistance of the Chinese army in Zhabei against the Japanese army. The Chinese army has often been the target of criticism from all parties, but now they have astonished everyone. Given the vast difference in the quality of weapons between the two sides, we cannot help but admire the bravery of the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army. At the same time, thousands of refugees, although losing their property and having their livelihoods cut off, still do not lose their perseverance and steadfastness, which is also unforgettable. If we do not make Chinese men and women truly know that all parties sincerely admire this good national character and do not do anything more tragic and sad, it is fortunate that relief is actively underway, although it is a drop in the bucket, it is not without supplementation. As for the Chinese soldiers, in addition to the enemy, they all know how to treat people from China and abroad with kindness and self-respect. Even the most stubborn people cannot but recognize this record created by the Chinese soldiers. (Translator's note: This article from the North China Daily News is extremely noteworthy.)</p>
<h3>French Concession Rumors - Great Hope That the Authorities Will Reiterate a Solemn Denial</h3>
<p>Recently, rumors in the French Concession have flourished, and people's hearts are uneasy. It is said that these rumors originated when the Japanese army's Commander Ueda visited the French Consul-General, accompanied by many armed Japanese soldiers, passing through the French Concession in automobiles. This caused misunderstandings among outsiders, especially since the French Concession authorities had previously stated that they would strictly adhere to neutrality, and that all Chinese and Japanese armed forces passing through the French Concession must disarm. Although Ueda's visit was ostensibly a courtesy call, it did, in fact, cause great anxiety among the residents. Yesterday, our reporter personally went to the French Concession to investigate, and all the rumors were found to be completely unfounded. However, it is hoped that the French Concession authorities, for the sake of reassuring the public, will issue another solemn denial.</p>
<p>Two British Soldiers Injured - Said to Be Due to Careless Handling of Ammunition</p>
<p>At about 5:00 AM yesterday morning, British garrison troops employed several Chinese laborers to unload ammunition at the Ewo Wharf. During the unloading, one of the laborers accidentally struck the body of a shell against a copper plate, causing an immediate explosion, which injured two British soldiers. Several laborers may have been in mortal danger. It was rumored that they were injured by a cannon shell, but this is not the case.</p>
<p>Chinese Citizens Should Temporarily Refrain From Going to the North Sichuan Road Area of Tiantong Road - Japanese Army Searches Are Very Strict</p>
<p>Recently, someone came from North Sichuan Road and reported that Japanese troops are stationed at street corners in the area north of Tiantong Road and east of North Sichuan Road. All men and women passing by are subjected to strict searches, their clothes are removed, and they are subjected to all sorts of indignities. It is hoped that Chinese citizens will temporarily refrain from going there to avoid unnecessary accidents.</p>
<p>American Report on the Shanghai Incident Indicates Losses of 170 Million Yuan - The Actual Number is More Than This</p>
<p>According to a Japanese newspaper, the American investigation report on the Shanghai Incident states that the losses of factories and workshops in the Zhabei and Hongkou areas are valued at approximately 170 million yuan, and approximately 110,000 people have lost their jobs. (Note: This report is far from accurate; our losses are much greater than this.)</p>
<p>Chinese Ratepayers' Association Sends Letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, Suggesting a Convention of Chinese and Foreign Ratepayers to Discuss Methods of Eradicating Violence and Protecting Commercial and Economic Security</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, which states:</p>
<p>"To the esteemed Sirs,</p>
<p>We have received a joint letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation, and the China National Salvation Ten-Person Corps, which states:</p>
<p>'Since the European War, benevolent people from various countries have exhausted their minds and resources to build a foundation of peace to safeguard the happiness of mankind in the world. However, under the actions of the Japanese militarists' occupation of Liaoning and Jilin, this foundation has been severely damaged. Not only has the Nine-Power Treaty's articles on respecting China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity been destroyed, but also the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which unanimously abandons the use of war as an instrument of national policy, has also been trampled upon.</p>
<p>Thus, the actions of the Japanese militarists have become today's world, where they are ignorant of the law, ignorant of humanity, and behave like bandits, violently seizing and holding good people hostage. Because various countries in the world fear their ferocity and dare not stop them, the League of Nations Council's three proposals to prevent the expansion of the scope of the conflict, and the joint warning of 44 countries that signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact to pay attention to treaty obligations, have been insufficient to satisfy their arrogance and have lost their value.</p>
<p>Our country's attitude of loyalty to the League of Nations, safeguarding the common interests of the world, and humbly seeking peace in good faith, is also regarded by them as weakness and deceit, and as an opportunity to take an inch and seek a mile. Thus, they conquered Longjiang, disturbed Tianjin, continued to occupy Jinzhou, and carried out all kinds of massacres that are not permitted in formal warfare.</p>
<p>On January 28 of this year, after the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai accepted the reply from the Mayor of Shanghai, who, in order to protect the commercial and economic relations of various countries, was forced to unconditionally endure humiliation and surrender, and clearly expressed his satisfaction, the militarists in Shanghai, ignoring trust and righteousness, openly used the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Defense Committee to order the maintenance of security in the neutral zone of the concession north of the Suzhou Creek, directing the Japanese troops, who had abandoned their defense responsibilities and acted like traitors, and the Japanese plainclothes teams, who were killing, arsoning, kidnapping, and robbing citizens like bandits, to implement their planned invasion of Zhabei.</p>
<p>This not only caused unprecedented damage and terror in all areas under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Government, including the areas surrounding the Auditorium Theater (photographed by Wang Xiaoting) which was burned down after it had ties to the flourishing of the concession, but also, as far as the concession area is concerned, the dignity of the entire neutral zone has been tragically destroyed, the police authority to maintain security has been seized, and the security guarantees purchased by Chinese and foreign taxpayers with huge taxes and fees have suffered painful violations under violence that is worse than bandits and exceeds the police authority of the concession.</p>
<p>In this dangerous situation, Chinese and foreign taxpayers, as well as the Shanghai Municipal Council, which receives tax revenue, have a shared responsibility to work together, rise up, and put out this violence for the sake of the authority of municipal administration and for the sake of public safety.</p>
<p>In view of this, our association specially suggests to your council that you promptly urge the Shanghai Municipal Council to convene a conference of Chinese and foreign taxpayers to discuss ways to gather strength, make adequate preparations, and eradicate violence, so as to ensure that actions that affect the lives, property, commercial and economic security, and development of Chinese and foreign taxpayers are not allowed to carry out any activities within the concession area. If taxpayers who have not been harmed sit idly by and ignore taxpayers who have been harmed, it is not only a disregard for responsibility, morality, and humanity, but also carries the risk of extending the danger to themselves.</p>
<p>All members of our association, standing in the position of taxpayers, are willing to do their utmost to bear and assist the Shanghai Municipal Council in any responsibility. We are sending this special letter to your council, hoping that your council will lead all Chinese taxpayers in the city to take immediate action, and please do your best to awaken the attention of taxpayers of other countries and work together.'"</p>
<p>We have examined the letter. The Japanese army's chaos in Shanghai has placed the neutral zone, which has been considered relatively safe for 88 years, in a dangerous state. Moreover, its destructive actions are not only directed at China but also cause extremely serious damage to various countries related to the concession. Maintaining the safety of the Public Concession is the responsibility of all related countries and the host country, and Japan is also one of the related countries. Even if it is hostile to the host country, it should still respect the common interests of all related countries. However, its atrocities are so serious, which shows that Japan has no regard for international interests. If this is not punished, the current situation of the Public Concession will undergo drastic changes. This is what your council, the related countries, the host country, and Chinese and foreign taxpayers should pay serious attention to.</p>
<p>In response to the above letter, we are sending this letter for your information and prompt resolution.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>To the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Refutes Rumors, Denounces Divisive Agitation, Reports Facts</p>
<p>Yesterday, Reuters reported from Tokyo that the Japanese side claimed that Mayor Wu had agreed on January 28 to withdraw Chinese troops stationed in Zhabei. Our reporter specifically visited Mayor Wu to inquire about the truth. Mayor Wu replied that he had never made such a statement to the Japanese side, and that this news was clearly fabricated by the Japanese to confuse the public.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the cable stated that the Japanese side would send an ultimatum to the 19th Route Army, and that Chiang Kai-shek's troops were not included in the demand for withdrawal. Its intention is nothing more than to sow discord and achieve its goal of aggression. It must be known that our 19th Route Army and other troops are all Chinese troops, and under the command of the entire government, when the enemy invades, we can only resist, etc.</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters Telegraphs the Central Government, Requesting the Swift Dispatch of Large Troops to Resist Japan, and the Deployment of Guangdong Troops to Jiangxi to Suppress the Communists - One Move to Secure the Interior and Resist Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Party Headquarters sent a telegram to the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, which states:</p>
<p>"In this time of national crisis, to the esteemed Central Executive Committee in Luoyang, and forwarded to the Military Affairs Commission for their consideration. We have just sent a telegram to Mr. Chen Bonan, Mr. Li Delin, and Mr. Bai Jiansheng in Guangzhou, which states (summary): 'The violent Japanese are invading Shanghai. Although our loyal and brave soldiers are resisting to the death, the Japanese army, having suffered repeated defeats, is continuously reinforcing Shanghai, and the war is expanding. Most divisions and brigades are engaged in suppressing the Communists in Jiangxi, which makes it difficult to attend to both tasks. Guangdong and Jiangxi are adjacent, and troops can arrive quickly. We should request that, in accordance with the resolution of the First Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, the armed comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi be quickly deployed to Jiangxi to take over the task of suppressing the Communists, so that the Central Army can move east along the Yangtze River and return to defend against the Japanese. This would be convenient for both military supplies and transportation, and would achieve twice the result with half the effort. We believe that defending against calamity and saving the country share the same goal, and we trust that you will sympathize with our situation. The situation is urgent and pressing, and we earnestly request that you quickly respond to the exigency, deploy troops to Jiangxi, and swiftly deploy the large troops in Jiangxi eastward to resist the Japanese. One move to secure the interior and resist foreign aggression. We are eagerly awaiting your response.'</p>
<p>We respectfully request that you telegraph the armed comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi to deploy to Jiangxi to take over the task of suppressing the Communists, and swiftly deploy the large troops in Jiangxi eastward to resist the Japanese. One move to secure the interior and resist foreign aggression. The telegram is urgent and pressing, and we cannot express our anticipation enough.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Kuomintang, respectfully."</p>
<p>The Business Community Requests the Power Company to Protest to Japan - Expel the Japanese Army Airfield - In Order to Protect Bondholder Interests</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Businesses on Avenue Edward VII has sent a letter to the Shanghai Power Company, requesting that it protest to Japan for forcibly building an airfield on the vacant land east of the Yangshupu Power Plant, in order to avoid losses to the holders of the 6% bonds.</p>
<p>The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>"To the esteemed Sirs,</p>
<p>We have recently received a letter from Mr. Wang Xiaozhai, manager of the Yaoming Mast Light Factory, stating that upon reading the newspaper, he was shocked to learn that the violent Japanese were forcibly building an airfield on the vacant land east of the Yangshupu Power Plant. It is understood that the power plant is operated by the American-owned Shanghai Power Company, and the company has issued a large number of 6% bonds in Shanghai over the years. Most of the holders of these bonds are Chinese, and they rely on the power plant as a guarantee. Now that the Japanese pirates are rampant and have forcibly established an airfield near the power plant, once military action approaches, the flames of war will inevitably endanger the plant. Then, our bondholders may be affected.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are sending this special letter to your association, requesting that you immediately send a letter to the Shanghai Power Company, asking them to protest to Japan and immediately expel the Japanese airfield. At the same time, convene all bondholders and file a protest, or demand the return of the loan to avoid losses, etc.</p>
<p>In view of this, we are sending this letter to your company for your information and action. Please promptly lodge a serious protest with Japan to protect the interests of bondholders, and please let us know the progress of the negotiations.</p>
<p>Liang Shiyi Sends Telegram to British Prime Minister Requesting Non-Obfuscation by Japanese Propaganda</p>
<p>It is rumored that Liang Shiyi will go to Tianjin to speak. Now, Mr. Liang is still living in Shanghai. It is also heard that two weeks ago, he sent a telegram to British Prime Minister MacDonald, which states:</p>
<p>"To Prime Minister MacDonald in London,</p>
<p>The recent atrocities committed by Japan in China have forced the peace-loving Chinese people to unite with the most intense determination to resist Japan and defend our territory. Since its invasion of Manchuria, Japan has made clear its intention not only to destroy China's sovereignty and territory, but also to trample on the international conventions and obligations that all countries in the world abide by. Therefore, even at the risk of jeopardizing the rights of countries related to the Far East, it does not care. Related countries should unite at this time to defend their rights.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a world-famous commercial port, which has been painstakingly developed by various countries for 80 years. British business occupies an important position. However, because the Japanese army occupied the Public Concession as a base for war against China, Shanghai has suffered heavy losses. If its atrocities are not stopped, in order to achieve its goal of destroying Chinese business and economy, Japan will inevitably launch attacks on commercial ports in the Yangtze River basin, and even in Hong Kong and Singapore. If so, the rights of various ports and countries will also be sacrificed. We deeply hope that your country and related countries will immediately take joint measures for self-defense, and hope that various countries will no longer be blinded by Japan's previous and future deceptive propaganda. Japan's intention to use deceptive propaganda will surely cause an unprecedented catastrophe in the Far East.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhijiang Cables Chiang Kai-shek to Request Permission to Assist Shanghai - Jiangsu Pacification Supervisor Zhang Zhijiang Recently Sent a Telegram from Yangzhou to Xue Ziliang, Cheng Songyun, and others Staying in Shanghai, which States:</p>
<p>"To Mr. Chiang Kai-shek on New Year's Day, a telegram stating: 'I have just received news from Shanghai that Japan is continuing to send troops to Shanghai to assist in the war, and has declared that it will not be threatened by any great powers to stop its military actions, and that it will not hesitate to mobilize the entire country if necessary, etc. Judging from the increasingly fierce fighting in Shanghai today, this letter should not be a rumor. The 19th Route Army is loyally resisting with unparalleled bravery. If Japan uses its entire national army to launch a joint attack, the disparity in numbers is a cause for great concern.</p>
<p>I believe that the outcome of the current war in Shanghai is related to the survival of the nation. Since Japan is coercing with force, we should also fight to the death with all our might. If we can continue to work hard and inflict heavy damage on the violent Japanese, our nation will have an opportunity to revive. Your Excellency is planning for the long term and must have already made plans. However, what I am deeply concerned about is that the violent Japanese are very close to Shanghai, and reinforcements can arrive in three days. Our army's transportation is inconvenient, and although we are in our own country, troop movements are slow, and we must first concentrate our forces in time for the opportunity.</p>
<p>The area north of the Yangtze River is still safe, and I will mobilize my troops to await orders. If there is any dispatch, I will be in the vanguard to fight to the death with the violent Japanese, etc.' I have not yet received a reply. Please inform me of any instructions. Your younger brother, Zhang Zhijiang, respectfully."</p>
<p>Information from the Shanghai Municipal Council: The Director-General Clarifies the Views on the Neutral Zone, Saying it is Not Irresponsible</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office sent a letter stating:</p>
<p>"The public has many misunderstandings about the relationship between the Public Concession and the great powers during this most critical period. It is hoped that the following opinion letter submitted by the Council's Director-General to the Board of Directors may have some effect in clarifying the situation. Most of these misunderstandings are obviously due to the difficulty for ordinary residents to distinguish between neutral countries and what can be called a stipulated neutral country.</p>
<p>The Director-General's opinion letter is translated as follows:</p>
<p>'In any sense, the Public Concession is not an independent country. However, the concession has certain unique characteristics that make it similar to an independent country in some respects. There is good reason to explain the term "neutrality" as used in modern international law, and to clearly distinguish between neutral countries and stipulated neutral countries.</p>
<p>A neutral country is a country that chooses not to join a war. In other words, the actions of a neutral country are voluntary and not dictated by external forces or coercion. The term "neutrality" has a wide range of applications. The state of neutrality can be artificially created. This method of creating neutrality is called "stipulated neutrality." A country's stipulated neutrality may be due to common practice or treaty. Common practice means tacit approval, or a custom based on such tacit approval.</p>
<p>The purposes a country seeks to achieve by being stipulated as neutral are often not completely the same, but there is always a fundamental purpose: to ensure that it is not invaded or attacked by neighboring countries. For the overall interests of neighboring countries, this method is generally considered to be a good strategy.</p>
<p>A country stipulated as neutral not only anticipates that it will not join any wars of its neighboring countries, but also anticipates that it will not itself be the subject of war. The freedom of action of a stipulated neutral country is subject to this restriction. The reward is that the country is guaranteed not to be invaded or attacked by its neighboring countries. Belgium, Switzerland, and Luxembourg are examples of countries stipulated as neutral by treaty.</p>
<p>It can generally be frankly admitted that the previous boards of directors of the Council have恪守 the principle that the Public Concession is a neutral zone similar to a neutral country, and have never involved the concession in the whirlpool of any wars or international disputes between the countries to which the residents of the concession belong.</p>
<p>Regarding the study of the status of the Public Concession, whether it can be a regulated neutral zone and be similar to a regulated neutral country is not so simple. As stated above, the regulated neutral country can only be created by common practice or treaty. Anyone who believes that the Public Concession has been created as a neutral zone by treaties concluded between the countries with political or other relations within the concession is doubtful as to whether their claim is valid.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, whether the Public Concession has become a stipulated neutral zone by common practice, or in other words, by the tacit approval or agreement of the countries concerned, or based on the custom of this tacit approval or agreement, or whether it is a problem on which the governments of the countries concerned cannot agree.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, suppose the Public Concession has been stipulated as a neutral zone by the countries concerned. Then, when necessary, it is the responsibility of the countries concerned, not the Shanghai Municipal Council, to cooperate in preventing the armed forces of any country from destroying the neutrality of the zone.</p>
<p>Closely related to the complex issue of concession neutrality is the issue of the status of the troops sent to Shanghai by the foreign governments. Since its establishment, the foreign community of the Public Concession has, in accordance with the principle of self-defense, demanded the right to self-protection against external attacks and internal disturbances, and has often maintained an armed neutral attitude when China has been in civil war, which has endangered the political and territorial integrity of the concession.</p>
<p>There have been many times when the military police in the concession were insufficient to protect the concession against attacks by any country, political party, warlord, or mob by force or thugs. Assistance from the navies and armies of several foreign countries has been requested. The landing of some foreign naval and military forces in the concession is clearly for the purpose of protecting the lives and property of the people of those countries.</p>
<p>However, in practical terms, the best way to effectively protect the people of the various countries is for the troops of the various countries to act jointly under unified command in accordance with a predetermined plan or method to protect the entire concession and with the consent of the commanders of the various countries. In this case, it can hardly be denied that at least some foreign countries have, by agreement, established and maintained the neutral situation of the Public Concession to resist any armed or transgressive actions by the Chinese government, political party, or mob that would damage the political or territorial integrity of the concession.</p>
<p>Whether the scope of this neutral situation is limited to this or is a contentious issue. The establishment and maintenance of this limited neutral situation of the Public Concession is purely for defensive purposes and is never for the purpose of attacking China or any other country.</p>
<p>Prior to the declaration of martial law on January 28, 1932, the commanders of the troops stationed in Shanghai, including the Japanese commander, had agreed on a plan for defending the Public Concession that was purely defensive in nature. The plan did not take into account that, in practice, there would be a state of war between China and Japan.</p>
<p>According to this plan, the outer perimeter of the concession was divided into districts, and each country's troops were assigned to a designated district to be responsible for the protection of that district. The dispatch of Japanese troops to Shanghai was to protect the people of that country. The northern district had a large number of Japanese residents and extensive Japanese interests. Therefore, the Japanese commander naturally hoped that the northern district would be assigned to the Japanese army. The distribution of the various districts to the various countries' troops was not the responsibility of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The assignment of the Japanese troops to the northern district was purely for defense purposes, and its intention was the protection of the Public Concession as a whole. The assignment of the other districts to other countries' troops was based on the same principle.</p>
<p>If the Japanese troops were to act beyond the purely defensive actions defined by the defense plan, then the Shanghai Municipal Council should not be held responsible, nor should the commanders of the other countries' troops stationed in Shanghai. In this regard, it should also be remembered that the Shanghai Municipal Council does not have any authority or jurisdiction over the troops of the great powers. Therefore, it cannot be held responsible for the actions of these troops. These troops are not directly responsible to the Shanghai Municipal Council, but only to the governments of their respective countries.'"</p>

Unfortunately, domestic construction has not yet been completed, and foreign insults have been repeatedly inflicted, to the point where the survival of the nation is hanging by a thread. Rather than succumb to the oppressive neighboring violent Japanese, lose our sovereignty, and humiliate ourselves and our country, we have no choice but to take the path of active resistance. We hope that all our armed comrades will remember the hardships of our predecessors in establishing the nation, and lament the suffering of the people. With a spirit of great fearlessness, we must engage in a long-term struggle, to suppress violence, promote justice, protect the dignity of the nation, and strive for the survival of the race. This is a crucial moment. Over the past few years, disputes among our armed comrades due to differences of opinion have been completely swept away by the common desire for sincere unity to jointly face the national crisis. From now on, the living will work together on the battlefield, and even the dead will smile in the afterlife, to witness our ultimate success. We sincerely express our heartfelt wishes, and urge all to strive together." (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>The Army and Navy Marshals Hold a Meeting</p>
<p>Unanimously Advocate Not Expanding Military Operations</p>
<p>The Cabinet Meeting Focuses on External Propaganda Regarding the Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>The Tokyo and Osaka newspapers of the 11th reported on the proceedings of the army and navy meeting, saying that yesterday (the 10th) at 2:00 PM, an important meeting of the army and navy marshals and military councilors was held at the residence of the Minister of the Navy in Kasumigaseki to discuss the Shanghai incident. Those present from the army included Prince Nashimoto, Yoshizumi Shirakawa, Takao Suzuki, Ikutaro Inoue, Jotaro Watanabe, Takashi Hishikari, all generals, as well as Army Minister Araki, Director-General of Military Education Muto, Vice Chief of Staff Masaki, and Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Koiso, among others.

Minister Osumi first reported on the sudden outbreak of the Shanghai Incident and the measures taken to respond, explaining the general outline. Then, Directors Toyota and Koiso gave a detailed supplementary explanation. After that, they jointly discussed various future military actions. All those present advocated that in order to ensure the maintenance of peace in East Asia, they would devote all their efforts to adopting the best methods and did not wish to expand military operations. Everyone was of one mind. (Note: Togo is a respected elder in the Japanese military, currently 86 years old. He performed outstanding service in the Russo-Japanese War and therefore holds considerable influence in the Japanese military. Regarding important army and navy matters in the current Shanghai Incident, it is necessary to consult Togo. It is said that Togo strongly advocates peace.)</p>

<p>Japanese Troops Capture Harbin After Days of Fierce Fighting with Self-Defense Forces</p>
<p>They Have Now Returned to the Huhu-Hailun Road</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Harbin, the Self-Defense Forces organized by Ding Chao and Li Du this time, united to resist Japan. The troops are vast and complex, and it has been difficult to unify command. Ding and Li are equal in rank and status. Li's嫡系 direct troops consist of Ma Xianzhang's 24th Brigade and Chen Zong's two battalions, totaling over 5,000 men. Ding Chao's 28th Brigade is commanded by Wang Ruihua, but in reality, it is no more than a regiment. In addition, the units of Gong Zhanhui, Feng Zhanhai, Song Wenjun, and Zhao Yi have not experienced major battles, and their equipment is not as good as the enemy's. Therefore, command is not as effective as desired. On the 2nd of this month, Li and Ding invited Wang Zhiyou to be the commander-in-chief, but Wang had orders but no authority. The brigades had differing opinions, and the deployment lacked coordination. Li Du and others knew that it would be difficult to sustain the resistance for long, but on the one hand, they hoped that 平方 (Ping Fang) would launch an attack from Shanhaiguan to restrain the Japanese army. On the other hand, they were making every effort to persuade Ma Zhanshan to rise up again and send troops along the Tao'ang Line to divide the Japanese forces. Gu Zi (顾自) After Li and Ding issued the telegrams, Ping Fang (平方) made no sound. Only Ma Zhanshan sent a telegram on the 5th, stating that he was leading his troops in a final struggle. At the same time, Ma immediately dispatched Cheng Zhiyuan's cavalry independent 8th Brigade from Qiqihar to take advantage of the situation and recover Longsha, and then advance along the Tao'ang Line to attack Tongliao, linking up with the volunteer army. Another unit, Yuan Chongshe's 1st Infantry Brigade, with two companies of cavalry attached, advanced east along the Huhu-Hailun Road to 　鐡廟台子站 (Tie Miaotai Station), stationed 15 li north of Harbin to 　应自卫军 (support the Self-Defense Forces). When this news reached Harbin, all circles celebrated, thinking that within the lunar year, the military situation in northern Manchuria would not change. The Japanese army stationed in Heihe, with more than a thousand men of the Suzuki Brigade and cavalry artillery, mobilized early on the 2nd, and seized the Dongqing (Eastern Qing) Railway Ang'angxi station passenger and freight cars, wanting to advance on Harbin to attack the Self-Defense Forces from behind. When they arrived at Yanluotun, they heard Ma Zhanshan's telegram resisting Japan, and also dismantled the Dongqing Railway tracks above Anda Station, blocking their advance. They then stopped coming to Harbin that night and hurriedly returned to Heihe. Cheng Zhiyuan's brigade, hearing the news, also stopped midway, not daring to advance further. The Japanese then mobilized troops from the Tao'ang Line to the Qiqihar Line overnight, with strict defense. Thus, the plan for our army to advance along the Tao'ang Line did not materialize. The Japanese army was able to gather a large force to deal with the Self-Defense Forces on the Harbin-Changchun Line at their leisure, and the Domon Division was also transferred from the Jinxi area, totaling more than 6,000 men. The 3,000 men of the Binben Regiment first advanced to Caijiagou Station of the Dongqing Railway. Because they were blocked by the Chen Decai Brigade of the Self-Defense Forces, they stopped there and did not immediately attack. Later, Chen's brigade was ordered to transfer to Shuangcheng to form a joint defense line. The Japanese army then continued to arrive with over 3,000 men, who boarded nine trains and headed towards Shuangcheng. Along the way, any demolished tracks were repaired by the workers of the Mantetsu (South Manchuria Railway). At 3:00 PM on the 3rd, they arrived at Shuangcheng. The Zhang Guangxi团 (regiment) of the 25th Brigade and the Wang Xiaozhi团 (regiment) of the 26th Brigade retreated without a fight. Li Du urgently transferred Ma Xianzhang's brigade from Wujia Station to resist. Ma's brigade discovered three enemy armored vehicles 70 li from Harbin at Sanjianbao. They装换东铁车轮载工人数十 (Changed the wheels of the Dongqing Railway and carried dozens of workers), wanting to repair the Shuangjingzi Railway Bridge. They were repelled by Ma's brigade. That night, the Japanese army occasionally harassed with cavalry, but there was no formal contact. At 5:00 AM on the 4th, the Japanese army attacked in two routes, one along the railway line, covered by four aircraft, and the other along the side of the railway, covered by armored vehicles and cavalry, attacking our army's flanks. Ding and Li, seeing the urgency of the battle, personally went to the front line to督战 (supervise the battle) and did not allow the soldiers to retreat, so the battle was extremely fierce. Two Japanese tanks were destroyed by our army's direct-fire cannons. The 28th Brigade of Ding Chao, the 26th Brigade of Song Wenjun, the 24th Brigade of Ma Xianzhang, and the two brigades of Gong Zhanhai and Feng Zhanhai had more than 15,000 men, all fighting desperately. However, the Japanese used aircraft to threaten them, causing the cavalry, infantry, and artillery to lose contact. At 2:00 PM, they gradually retreated. After 5:00 PM, the defense was withdrawn to Guxiangtun in western Harbin. The front line retreated to Sangu屯 (Tun), only 20 li from Harbin, and the situation was extremely urgent. However, Ding and Li were not discouraged. They discussed with Ma Zhanshan overnight to send reinforcements. Ma immediately ordered Yuan Chonggu's brigade to assist. At about 7:00 AM on the 5th, the Japanese army began a fierce attack, concentrating its main force at Guxiangtun, Pianlianzi, Hejiagou, and Xinzhenhe. Japanese aircraft dropped hundreds of bombs, and any place where our troops were concentrated was bombed. The cavalry suffered heavy damage because they had no cover. Yuan Chonggu's brigade suffered particularly heavy casualties in Hejiagou. By about 10:00 AM, the artillery fire intensified, and traffic in Harbin was completely stopped. All businesses closed their doors, and there were almost no pedestrians on the streets except for a few police officers. At 2:30 PM, the Japanese Wakamatsu Regiment attacked and occupied from Xiangfang, Shanghao, and Lanhan in southern Harbin. They occupied the radio station and the barracks of the 26th Brigade. A large force invaded Ximajiagou. At 3:00 PM, they arrived at Xiba Zashi and the Railway Bureau in Nangang. Because our army was being pursued by aircraft in the air, they retreated to the northeast. At 4:40 PM, the Japanese Binben Regiment entered and occupied Harbin Main Station along the Dongqing Railway. All units stopped attacking at the same time. Only a few aircraft were still circling in the sky, reconnoitering the direction of our army's retreat. After the Japanese occupied Harbin, Japanese residents, veterans, and White Russians held victory flags and went to the station to welcome them. At about 5:00 PM, two armored vehicles, led by a car from the Japanese consulate, paraded around the city for a week. However, our compatriots all avoided them. The Self-Defense Forces made a general retreat after 5:00 PM on the 5th, dividing into two branches, one retreating to Sanliangshu in Dongbu, and the other retreating to Machuankou in Jiangbei. By 8:00 PM, all units had gathered there. Li, Ding, and others arrived at Songpu Town one after another, and discussed all night, deciding that the main force would retreat to Huhu-Hailun Road, and a part would be led by Ding Chao to Acheng, while Li Du would lead the 24th Brigade back to Yilan, seeking to replenish their forces and then join Ma Zhanshan to counterattack. On the morning of the 6th, the units set off separately. However</p>
<h3>British Protest Against Japanese Bombing of Refugee Camp</h3>
<p>The General Secretary of the Flood Relief Association, a Briton named Simpson, previously protested to the Japanese Consul General regarding the bombing of a disaster refugee camp by Japanese aircraft. The Japanese Consul General subsequently responded to Simpson with a letter containing evasive and deflective language regarding each point of the protest. Mr. Simpson, believing that the reasons given were inconsistent with the facts, sent another letter of rebuttal. The second letter stated: "Dear Sir, Your letter of February 15th was only delivered to me by your messenger at 12:30 pm today (i.e., February 17th). Your letter mentions receiving my letter of February 15th, which is incorrect, as I sent my letter on February 10th. Regarding the last section of your letter, I am enclosing copies of my original letter to your office dated February 12th and my telegram to the League of Nations dated the evening of February 11th for your review. As for the delivery of my letter of February 12th to your office, the seal of the Japanese Consulate General stamped on my office delivery book serves as proof. Regarding the content of your letter, my response begins with the matter of the bombing of the disaster victims. The Japanese naval authorities have asked you to convey their deepest apologies. I would very much like to report this expression to the President of the Disaster Relief Association so that he can relay it to all members of the association. Your letter states that the disaster refugee camp was connected to Chinese military positions and had barbed wire. I know that the disaster refugee camp is two miles away from the North Railway Station, and the closest point to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is one mile away. Therefore, it cannot be considered connected to Chinese military positions. This point was already made in my letter of February 12th. As for the claim about barbed wire, it is completely incorrect. I sent people to fully investigate the cause of the bombing. According to the investigation, one Japanese aircraft flew near the refugee camp before the bombing on February 2nd. The pilot waved to the disaster victims in the refugee camp. At that time, there were 3,000 children in the refugee camp. How could it be considered a place where troops were stationed? Furthermore, on February 5th, the aircraft strafed with machine guns before dropping bombs. At that time, a Mr. Ma was injured in the refugee camp as a result. The pilot lowered the aircraft very close to the ground to facilitate opening fire on the refugee camp with machine guns. To still claim that the disaster refugee camp was mistaken for a military post is truly incomprehensible. I received the report of this incident on February 7th, after the bombing had already occurred. The reason I did not protest to you earlier is that I did not receive the report until then. Had I received the report at the time of the incident, I would have protested to you on February 5th without delay. One final point that I would like to bring to your attention is that a Red Cross flag was hung on the door of the disaster refugee camp, and a Blue Cross flag was hung above the hospital."</p>
<h3>Japan's Tough Stance</h3>
<p>Demanding Chinese Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>Hopes for Peace Vanish</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports: The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury has learned that talks to resolve the Shanghai Incident based on mutual concessions between China and Japan are currently underway. It is reported that the Japanese side has requested that the Chinese troops withdraw from the Shanghai area to a suitable distance, and the Japanese troops are also willing to withdraw within the defense zone boundaries. They also stated that after the Chinese troops withdraw, the Japanese troops will no longer take aggressive actions. Furthermore, the Japanese troops plan to withdraw from the Wusong area and a small portion of Zhabei that they occupy. Once both sides have completed the troop withdrawal, diplomatic negotiations will begin to discuss plans to prevent a recurrence of this incident. There are rumors circulating that the Japanese side has sent an ultimatum to the Chinese troops, but the Japanese Consulate General stated at noon today that the Japanese military authorities have not taken such action. However, they may issue a notice requesting the Chinese troops to withdraw at a later time. However, the issuance of this notice will depend on the progress of the peace talks, or it may not even be necessary. It is hoped that a mutually agreeable agreement can be reached soon to achieve a peaceful resolution. According to the current plan under discussion, Wusong will not be occupied by either Japanese or Chinese troops, but rather maintained by Chinese police. According to Japanese sources, the Chinese troops do not need to retreat too far, only beyond the range of small cannons, which would satisfy the Japanese. Their intention seems to be seven or eight miles, not the previously reported twenty or thirty miles. However, according to a Tokyo cable received by the Associated Press this morning, the Japanese Ministry of the Army has ordered General Ueda, commander of the Japanese forces in Shanghai, to send an ultimatum to the Chinese commander, demanding withdrawal within twenty-four hours (see the National News Agency cable in another column). Judging from the attitude of the Japanese authorities, it remains extremely tough.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Peace Movement News</h3>
<p>British Minister Continues Mediation</p>
<p>American Minister Leaves Shanghai Today</p>
<p>Regarding the peace movement, British Minister Sir Miles Lampson is still making every effort to mediate. The principle of the British Minister's mediation is to promote a ceasefire between the two armies without harming the dignity of either China or Japan. As for the Shanghai Incident itself, it will be negotiated separately through diplomatic channels after the ceasefire. A person close to the British Minister told our newspaper reporter yesterday that Sir Miles Lampson has been conducting conciliation talks with the Chinese and Japanese authorities for several days. There is still no concrete decision, but it cannot be said that the prospects for the peace movement are entirely hopeless. Although peace talks are taking place here, the final decision rests in Nanjing and Tokyo. Sir Miles Lampson is very friendly with both the Chinese and Japanese sides, and he is now using this friendship to mediate for peace. The Chinese and Japanese authorities are currently consulting with their respective governments. As for the content of the British Minister's mediation, it involves the simultaneous withdrawal of the frontline troops of the Chinese and Japanese armies, with the Chinese troops withdrawing five miles away from the concessions, and the Japanese troops withdrawing into the concession lines. The neutral zone will be maintained by Chinese police, etc. The Italian Chargé d'Affaires, Cianno, hosted a banquet yesterday afternoon for the British, American, and French ministers. American Minister Johnson is scheduled to leave Shanghai by destroyer this morning to return to Beijing. The American Minister met with our newspaper reporter yesterday afternoon and briefly discussed the peace movement. The American Minister expressed pessimism, but seemed quite concerned about the number of residents in Zhabei. British Minister Lampson and French Minister Wilden will remain in Shanghai for a few more days.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Japanese Troops Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Totaling Over 5,400</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, over 2,000 Japanese troops arrived in Shanghai again. After landing, they went directly to Avenue du Marechal Joffre. In the afternoon, another 3,400 troops arrived and were billeted in Japanese cotton mills such as Yue Feng, Donghua, and Gongda. According to reliable sources, the total number of Japanese troops in Shanghai has already reached over 30,000. It is reported that another 40,000 troops will be transported to Shanghai successively, bringing the total to 80,000. The transport of the troops, both when boarding the ships in Japan and when disembarking in Shanghai, is carried out at night, with extreme secrecy, to avoid criticism from other countries. Furthermore, according to investigations, the artillery regiment and chemical warfare battalion of the Japanese 9th Division, whose soldiers wear white clothing and masks, landed at the Dada Wharf at 10:00 PM on February 14th, carrying over twenty boxes of gas.</p>
<h3>Summary of Important Japanese News</h3>
<p>Japan Opposes Opening the League of Nations General Assembly. A Japanese newspaper reports a Tokyo dispatch stating that the Japanese government, recognizing that the convening of the League of Nations General Assembly is inevitable, has instructed its representative, Sato, to raise objections. At the Board of Directors meeting on the 16th, Sato strongly argued that there was no need to convene the meeting, and even if a majority voted in favor of holding the meeting, the statement submitted under Article 15, Paragraph 2 should not be considered. He also criticized the League's understanding as insufficient.</p>
<p>Shigemitsu Hosts Diplomatic Corps Banquet to Smooth Things Over. A Japanese newspaper reports that at 9:00 PM the night before, Japanese Minister Shigemitsu hosted a dinner party on the American flagship Augusta for the British, American, French, and Italian ministers and the senior commanders of various countries to smooth things over regarding the Shanghai Incident. The party did not break up until 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>Ueda and Suematsu Inspect Defense Lines. The Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun reports that Commander Ueda, guided by Commander Uematsu, inspected the battle lines at 1:00 PM on the 16th. Rear Admiral Suematsu, commander of the Second Fleet, also went to the Zhabei and Avenue du Marechal Joffre areas to inspect the defensive positions.</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Restricts Activities of Japanese Residents. The Great Evening News reports that the Japanese Consulate General, due to numerous complaints from outside about the activities of Japanese residents in Hongkou, sent a letter yesterday (the 16th) to the chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Union, cautioning the Japanese residents that all future actions should be extremely cautious and should not exceed their inherent authority. The letter stated that Shanghai has a complex international character and that dealings with Westerners should be especially prudent. There have been several instances recently of foreigners with proper credentials being treated rudely by members of the Japanese guard corps. Therefore, it is hoped that Japanese residents will be extremely cautious in the future to avoid any further such unfortunate incidents.</p>
<p>Three Million Citizens Support the 19th Route Army</p>
<h3>Declaration to Fight to the End</h3>
<p>No Room for Reconciliation Unless Japanese Troops Withdraw</p>
<p>Firmly Oppose Establishing a Neutral Zone</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Federation, representing three million citizens of Shanghai, yesterday issued a solemn declaration expressing opposition to the establishment of a neutral zone in Shanghai, supporting a national mobilization for self-defense, and endorsing the 19th Route Army to fight to the end. The original text is as follows: "Since the brutal Japanese army used its military force to invade our three northeastern provinces, its hideous face has become increasingly exposed. On the 28th of last month, the Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai, after their consul had replied to our municipal government that they were satisfied, violated faith and provoked war. Our 19th Route Army, for the sake of defending our national territory, swore to resist to the death and fought fiercely for ten days, repeatedly defeating strong enemies. Our people, united in hatred of the enemy, are determined to be shattered jade rather than whole tiles, striving for a lifeline for our nation and people, and doing everything in their power to support our loyal and courageous 19th Route Army. Unexpectedly, while we are shedding blood and fighting the enemy in a moment of crisis, the ruling gentlemen suddenly hesitate between war and peace, and are indecisive. The Japanese are even shameless enough to propose various unreasonable conditions in the hope of forcing us to surrender, thus causing unnecessary fears. If we are determined to sacrifice, then justice will eventually triumph over power. Material losses are only minor matters. Our association dares to represent three million citizens of Shanghai and firmly make the following declarations: (1) There is absolutely no room for reconciliation unless the Japanese troops first withdraw from Chinese territory. (2) We oppose the establishment of a neutral zone. (3) We support the 19th Route Army in resisting Japanese aggression by force to the end. (4) We demand a national mobilization and the implementation of legitimate self-defense, rejecting any demands from the Japanese side. The above four points are our minimum demands today. If they cannot be achieved and we end up softening, then the sacrifices of tens of millions of lives and properties in Shanghai will be in vain. The rise and fall of the nation depends on this one action. We hope that all our compatriots across the country will uphold their responsibility as individuals, urge the authorities to unite and rise up together, and prevent Qin Hui and Zhang Bangchang from reappearing today. May the nation be fortunate, may the people be fortunate. This is our declaration."</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Criticizes Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Reports Truthfully</p>
<p>The Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News reports that London newspapers are quite concerned about the Japanese army landing from the public concessions. The Geneva correspondent of the News Chronicle criticized the Japanese proposal to force Chinese troops to withdraw twenty miles as extremely brutal and unreasonable, and said that all foreign ambassadors to Japan could completely withdraw from Japan.</p>
