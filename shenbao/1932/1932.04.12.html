<p>時評</p>
<h3>論綏靖彬</h3>
<p>多時藴釀之國難會議。今已於本月七日在洛陽開幕矣。原聘會員五百餘人。茲到會者纔百餘人。僅及三分之一。則斯會之不滿人意。從可覘知。斯會討論範圍。早經規定爲綏靖救災禦侮三項。不能逾越。吾人對於斯便之限制。亦不能認爲滿意。然而此綏靖救災禦侮三項。亦誠爲當前之大問題。故願分别貢陳所見。以供國人之商討。今請先言「綏靖」。</p>
<p>今日之所謂「綏靖」。其最大目的。自爲共產黨紅軍。誠然。邇年以來。共黨勢力。已如火燎原。日益盛熾。一般人談虎色變。日怵於大禍之即在目前。然而共黨究何自而來乎。究何由而日益蔓延乎。此乃爲吾人所應探討之根本問題。不探其根因。而徒談「綏靖」。是正有類於「緣木而求魚」。今之談撲滅共黨者。曰應「斷絕赤匪思想言論與其出版物之流傳」。也日</p>
<p>應「大舉圍剿根本撲滅」也。似是矣。而實則皆非。吾人認爲今日之共產黨。不同於明末張獻忠李自成等因綠會之流宼。彼有嚴密之組織。有共信之主義。有實行之政綱。而又有國際之背景。其產生。其擴大。非爲偶然。即如普通一般人所想像。共黨勢力之所以日益擴大爲。由於一般窮苦工農之盲從。然而彼窮苦之工農。究何從而來乎政治之黑暗。内亂之綿延。捐稅之榨壓。官吏之敲詐。豪紳之吸吮。於是而國民經濟日益凋敝。人民生計日益窮蹙。民無生路。自挺而走險。是孕育共產黨而且日益助長其勢力者。皆政治黑暗所致也。去年七月間。楊杏佛氏在「赤禍與中國之存亡」一文中。亦曾有言。「農民生計不能解决地方政治不能修明。雖無赤匪。國豈能久。而况土劣貪污窮困即爲赤禍之製造廠乎」此其言至足供吾人之長慮而深思</p>
<p>共產主義。今已成爲一種根深蒂固之學說。世界各國皆可公開討論。其宣播。其流傳。固絕非斷絶其出版物。禁止其研究所可遏抑者也。假如一種學說。可以權力禁止而絕其流傳。則秦皇坑儒焚書。今世應無一人能識字矣。假如</p>
<p>青年之思想。可以管朿而禁錮。則沙皇今應仍爲俄國之君主如日大舉園勦可以撲滅。則民不畏死峻罰刑。將安所施。去年數次園勦。動員數十萬大軍。成效如何。或者勦之結果。適爲助長其勢力之擴大何以軍隊之騷擾官吏之貪污。豪紳之誣陷。皆適爲淵驅魚爲叢驅雀也。</p>
<p>以故吾人認爲今日之「匪」。絕非「勦」所可「滅」思想不可禁錮亦絶　　非禁錮所可阻遏。欲言「綏靖」必從澄清政政治建立適合大多數人民之利益之民主政治着手民主政治建立。由解决土地問題進而建設非資本主義</p>
<p>之民生主義的社會。而後民乃得生。社會乃得繁榮。社會秩序乃能永久安定。除此而外吾人誠未見綏靖之道如其有之應亦不過殘民以逞耳</p>
<h3>停戰會議大會延期</h3>
<p>期限問題交國聯解决小組委員會繼續開會停戰會議暫行停開之說、已略誌昨日本報、迄至昨午、外交部情報司長張似旭奉命、正式通知英公使藍溥森、告以我方行政院長汪精衛、現正在洛陽、舉行國難會議、滬洛交通不便、政府訓令尚未到滬、停戰會議祗有暫行展期並請轉達日方等語、預定昨日下午三時、在英總領事館舉行之第十五次停戰會議遂未開成停戰會議、原擬展期一天、至今日再開惟今日是否照開仍屬未定、</p>
<h3>大會延期原因</h3>
<p>據本報記者所得非正式消息、停戰會議軍事小組會議、雖决定照常開會、但大會恐尚有數日之停頓、蓋大會撤結、在日軍完全撤退至一月二十八日前原防期限問、題終未得圓滿解决、我政府對於中日爭端之確定政策早已完全信賴國聯解决、即上海停戰會議、亦根據國聯議會三月四日之决議案進行、今國聯議會特别委員旣於昨日開會、則宜根據原來方針將此間爭議不决之日軍最後撤退期限問題仍交國聯方面處理、以冀得一公平之解决外交部長羅文幹、聞已訓令日内瓦顔惠慶代表、决定在國聯議會特别委員會開會時將此案提出故此間停戰會議再開日期、須視日内瓦方面形勢而定軍事小組委員會、在大會停頓期間、决定繼續進行</p>
<h3>代表會勘地點</h3>
<p>軍事小組委員、會昨日因江灣引翔等撤兵區之查勘其範圍及詳細地點之畫分、不如吳淞一帶之困難故中日雙方及友邦代表於上午九時、齊集英領署、預備出發時遂又臨時變更、中日友邦三方派代表四人出發視察、計我方派十九路軍秘書張益東·日方派參謀西村·副官黎岡·中立國方面派法軍事參贊彭那維泰四人分乘汽車三輛、經虹口出發赴江灣萬國體育塲至殷行鎭、然後再至引翔一帶視察至十二時許即歸、旋我代表向參謀長黃强報告據英參贊桑希爾談閘北方面不甚重要、如須視察、亦將派代表前往、各代表遇有困難時、全體代表再行出發、桑氏最後謂、渠爲中立國人、各地均以不偏爲本旨、故上次視察吳淞時日記者行至中途、亦被阻止折回云云、</p>
<h3>小組昨晨會議</h3>
<p>小組會議於昨日午後三時在英領署舉行、出席代表、我方黃强·郭德華·日方田代·西村·阿部·梶原·英參贊桑希爾·美參贊特萊斯台爾·法參贊彭那維泰·意參贊法拉鐵尼·討論浦東及蘇州河南之華軍駐防問題、且詢我方代表、日軍撤退時、在浦東及南市之華軍、是否須加以干涉、我方代表、即答以現所討論者、係日軍之撤退問題、而非中國之主權問題、此已離撤兵之基本原則甚遠、不能討論於是日代表與我方作長時間之辯論爭執頗久未能解决、至是遂爲友邦代表提出折衷辦法居中緩和但雙方對此種折衷辦法仍有激烈之辯論歷久未决、該會於五時廿分完畢、定今日午後三時、繼續討論、</p>
<h3>着手起草方案</h3>
<p>昨日小組會中、對於江灣引翔港兩地之日兵撤退區刻由美國出席代表起草規定區域線起草畢後再交中日雙方代表决定現該項方案正在着手進行中、</p>

<p>軍事小組委員會昨晚公報云、日軍暫行退駐地點業由中立國代表視察完畢、且已由小組委員會同意、午後續開會議、討論中國軍隊防地、稍有進展、休會至明日下午三時再開、</p>
<h3>上海停戰談判將移國聯辦理</h3>
<p>顔移國聯辦理顔惠慶聲稱折衷辦法勢難接受國聯將考慮新建議國民新聞社十日日内瓦電云中國總代表顔惠慶今日聲稱渠將請國聯辦理中日爭執之十九委員會注意上海停戰談判未能實現國聯决議案内條件、並謂上星期六、上海所謂之折衷辦法、勢難接受、因其中未曾規定日軍實行退出中國境内之期限、因此渠意國聯勢將被迫考慮新建議云、</p>
<h3>各團體代表昨謁郭泰祺</h3>
<p>反對屈辱協定本埠中國學生救國會·中華民族自决會·中國青年救國會·華僑同志會等團體昨推代表沈祖儒·王志聖·燕金·張鵑聲·鄧次侯·李嶠峙·戴天道等、於昨日上午九時、赴外交辦事處携帶質問書面質郭代表幾點、㈠江灣閘北吳淞引翔四要區、爲何承認日軍佔據所謂六個有内地方情形恢復至平常交通狀態時完全撤退、此種欺騙愚弄人民之協定、郭代表何以接受並聞今日下午簽字、郭代表是否甘心賣國、㈡盛傳上海設立自由市、此項滅亡國土及剝奪我人民資格之消息、究竟難否、㈢浦東蘇州河以南我軍駐守情形與據兵談判轟無任何關係、日本無理提出詢問郭代表何以承允報告、在在屈辱投降、何如此無能、㈣上次晋謁郭代表時、提出凡暴日海陸空軍未完全撤退反對任何談判當時郭代表完全採納並表示如有困難時自願退位現聞即將簽定屈辱協定、郭代表何以戀位甘爲賣國工具乎等等、原擬面呈適郭代表因公外出、鵠候至十二時由情報司長張似旭代表報告、㈠本日下午會議停開、㈡滬案已呈請政府提出國聯解决、該代表等聞之氣憤萬分該代表等因無結果、遂出、</p>

<h3>倫敦人士預測上海談判前途</h3>
<p>路透社十一日倫敦電云上海中日談判之决裂、倫敦政界不甚驚異當局視中日雙方提出之要求、完全不能融合、幾可料定其必成僵局、惟料談判之决裂、不致使敵對行動復作、今料上海討論之不成功、唯有移至日内瓦討論、但日内瓦能否成功、亦不能預定也、日本之要求數種保障使引起此次戰爭之狀態、不致再見倫敦人士視爲非不公允政界則對於中國不接受、因以可令日軍卒能完全撤退之建議、頗以爲異、</p>

<p>烏乎。自海上軍興以來。將士之死者多矣。未有如蕰藻浜一役。决死者六十輩赴死之烈也。六十輩者。隸十九軍。多粤籍。不能詳其名氏。今歲二月。倭旣屢敗不獲逞。十三日。復驅五千餘衆誓必死。犯我蕰藻浜之陳壘。勢如摧山排海。呼聲動天地。數里之内。血肉橫飛。我軍苦戰。自已達申未已。勢瀕危。六十輩者大忿。慷慨請决死各纏大爆彈環其胸背及四體。並以火油濡上下衣分伍潛入敵陣。突仆地搪掌。彈齊發。骨肉皆糜碎賊出不意。當者亦糜碎。遠近相應。倉卒中。賊以爲大軍襲至。遂大潰。我軍乘勢逐北。十餘里而後止。浜水爲之不流。後十餘日。復有四十輩以此法破江灣之賊軍數千。</p>
<p>王蘧常日。昔人有言日。殺一賊而死。足自償。死無恨。殺二賊而死。則爲國立功矣。况諸烈士之什伯於此者乎。吾知諸烈士其身雖死。其志彌樂而無所恨。獨念泯泯無所償而受死者爲可恨也。無所償</p>

<h3>人不如狗</h3>
<p>— 鸚哥</p>
<p>南通張謇曾謂「人不如狗」說這名話是有着後述的一個原因的。</p>
<p>某洋行買辦。原籍是如皐人。某日曾携其愛犬由滬回如皐家去看看家裹的人。那時他的妻子因丈夫多年未歸。已經姘上一個本地的漢子。度他們甜蜜的生活。他們的情愛黨然也高速度的升漲到火熱一團。當然女的丈夫回家是必得要破壞他們的好夢。斷送他們至於悲苦孤寂的地步。於是他倆就把心狠一狠把女的才夫謀殺了把屍體埋葬在鄰近的地下。但是死人的愛狗却還活着。並且終天對着警察署哭。打它它也不走。於是警察很奇怪。便跟着它走幾步。這狗是受過高深訓練的。看見有人跟着。於是它便領路。一直領到死屍葬埋的地方。用它的脚挖土。終於把死屍挖了出來。一件謀殺案才得破案。張謇知道這狗的義行。立刻請它坐綠呢轎子。並且大做其文章。大意都是講「人不如狗」。並且贈它一匾云。「愧我不如。」這自然已經是舊話。而今之漢奸。比此狗何如。</p>

<p>試問外侮這麽厲害，眼看即將亡國滅種，一個人祗要不是良心死透，血冷透，如何還肯懷私心，拉軍隊，拓自已勢力，爭個人地位？馮玉祥氏說這幾名句大澈大悟的話，把歷來新舊軍閥造孽作辭的表裹，說得痛快淋漓，在現役軍人中，也還差强人意。全國軍事領袖們，要是眞誠愛國衛民，對此數語，應下一番深長省察的功夫，而立刻表現「精誠團結，共赴國難」的一顆赤心！</p>
<p>坐而言不如起而行！希望練兵數十年堅部，開赴前線殺敵！倘如安居泰山之巔，清唱高調，究屬無濟於事，即使眞的生病，也當排除萬難，力疾從公。要知國難急如火燒眉毛，不是軍人們逍遙遊的時期了。）（</p>
<h3>滬戰與軍器）六（</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>至義和團事變。八國聯軍進京。青鋼砲被日本奪去幾尊。他們遂仿造青銅七纏野山砲。甲午之戰。受日本野山砲的威脅。損失很大。自此以後。歐美各國。都傾力改良製造高射砲。日俄大戰。日本已創製有阪式野山砲。與二十八纒榴彈砲。因此旅順大連方面。都爲砲火所蹂躪？一八九七年。法國發明砲身後坐式野砲。其後因科學進步。關於砲口制退機。砲身自緊法。自由交換式。内管法等。逐漸改革完善。恰這時無熔劑火藥也發明。於是軍器上的變革。大有一日千里之勢。而射發的速度。砲架的構造。觀測機關的精巧。尤不可以言語形容了</p>
<p>這回上海大戰。日軍所用的砲。有野砲中的坦克車砲。步兵砲。野砲。山砲。騎兵砲。輕榴彈砲。野戰重砲。與特種砲中的迫擊砲。高射砲。機關砲。遠程射砲等十餘種。被我軍俘獲的。以迫擊砲野砲坦克車砲爲最多。上列各砲的口徑。小自七緾。大至五十二緾。其射程的距離。單說野砲一種。能達一萬四千米突。中等口徑的砲。能達幾萬米突。至於遠程射砲。更不必說了。</p>
<p>歐洲大戰時候。德國攻擊巴黎的時候有一種裴泰Belta砲。口徑不過二十一緾。砲彈重量百二十　。可以射達百二十粁(二十七里以上)的距離一秒鐘的初速廣爲千六百米突彈路的最高。點能高射到二十八粁(即九里半)的空中。當時法國上下莫不心驚膽裂。到了大戰末期。德軍有裴爾泰砲七門。聽說在十年間。德國又新造了極厲害的砲。現在他們秘而不宣。萬一世界大戰再發。自然出現於世。最近法國也製造一種遠程射砲。可以射達百八十粁(四十里左右)這種利器。逐年的進步。使人類的命運。隨之而愈形不安了。</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記（三二）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第四回婚約逼人來游移自擾宼氛掠地去釁始重開若在平時。本來這種事是全由先父經管。用不着我去問。只因出了這塲重大變故。家產蕩然。我在外邊所需要的費用。來源斷絕。才想起先父從前提起過。大奎叔所經理的那份買賣。多一半的本錢是我們的。再加上這兩天手頭正窘。故而寫信去請他匯錢。不想他竟藉此賴賬。根本要吃没我這筆僅存的財產。其實不論這個合夥領東的關係。單講叔侄的情誼。看我目前這樣不幸。他就慷慨與我一些補助。又待何妨。何况我這筆費用。是向來由他那裹撥慣的。一旦咬住牙不肯承認。在情理上他也未必講得通。果然。他就預占脚步。反在信上說我從來已挪欠了他的欵項不少。如今償還無望。勢難再借。乾脆請我往後要自尋獨立的生活。别再倚賴他這個叔叔。旣占了我了便宜。還須受他一頓敎訓。我這眞是寃苦透了。說罷。兩眼潮濕着只不住的暗暗埀涙。魏卓謀一壁將信接過來翻開細看。一壁聽安玉田那樣悲憤塡膺的告訴。不由也歛住了詼諧的本色。將信放下來長嘆着道。你這位堂叔眞不是個人。你還不知道你家裹這回的大岔子。實是他招惹上的完全受了他的害呢。不然。牛黑風雖是個萬惡的竿子頭。郤與你家無寃無仇。又何致於平白地就下這種毒手。我原先也不清楚這番内情。只因今早也接著家鄉一封信。是梅村梅子柯寫來的。他又是你那堂房小兄弟玉源的娘舅。事後玉源幸得無恙。的。但又怕傳聞失實。說出來徒傷你　叔侄的感情。安玉田聽到這裹。便急急追問道。如今你總已明白我與他無情義可言了。有什麽特别内情。就請你快說罷。欲知魏卓謀究說出些什麽來。下回自有分解。</p>

<p>谈言</p>
<h3>馬占山與香烟金·</h3>
<p>昨天我看見周君瘦鵑，把馬占山造像打碎的一段趣話，我便想起了所見的一件事實·</p>
<p>我的亭子間，賃在法租界，天天早上坐十七路無軌電車，到公司去辦公，到晚間回來·這是我風雨無阻固定的一種勞工生活·一日電車經過大世界附近，忽見一堵粉壁上，發見一個很大的廣告，廣告上面畫一位年約五十左右的一位將軍·立馬横刀，英氣勃勃，大有不可一世之槪，上面題着馬占山香烟幾個大字·</p>
<p>其時馬占山正在嫩江，昻昻溪等處，與日人血戰，慷慨激昻，奮勇殺敵，國内外憂國之士·莫不解囊捐助·函電慰勞·該香烟公司景慕馬占山大名，亦應運而生的出子一種馬占山牌香烟·聞此種香烟，一時異常風行，正可說一名是名利雙收了·</p>
<p>不意近日這個很大的香烟廣告，忽然不見，依舊是一堵粉壁，而在白粉的中間，還隱隱露着馬占山一種可憐的印像，似乎表演着我實在無顔，對不起國人的樣子，我想該公司所以取消這香烟的綠故亦，是與周君打碎馬占山造像一樣地憤激，因此馬占山倒霉，連香烟也倒霉·</p>
<p>我想起了這樣一段事實，便發生一種感想，同是一個人，同是馬占山，先後的時間還不及三月。爲什麽昔的馬占山，使人崇拜，使人做造像，使人出香烟留爲紀念，曾幾何時，造像打碎，香烟取消，令人十分痛恨吐駡，古人說不能流芳千古，孰若遺臭萬年，乃馬占山於二三月間把「流名千古」與「遺臭萬年」的兩件大事，一齊做盡，原是一椿奇聞·</p>
<p>馬占山旣有流芳千古的價值，何以舍之不爲，而爲此遺臭萬年的事，世人莫不替馬占山可惜·或日·馬占山本是綠林豪客，無所謂流芳與不流芳，當時抗日，亦不過激於一時義憤·偶而出此·世人崇拜馬占山，本來是受馬占山的欺騙，這話也是很有見地，倘使正眞曉得義憤的人，决不會變節如是的迅速·</p>
<p>我的見解，却不如此，　馬占山雖是綠林豪客，但是他的義氣雖不能激發於永久，尚能激發於一時到底馬占山尚有一些義憤可取，尚有一時可以激發·我引領北望，見坐擁兵權而操不抵抗主義者，其血已冷盡，并且没有這一時，更没有方法可以去激發·試問比較馬占山何如·</p>

<h3>滬戰哀白蕉</h3>
<p>一馬降，三省失，不抵抗，禍乃烈，田中執政昭和初，大陸遺策謀貫澈，碩鼠逐逐竟無厭，又向江南圖囊括，敵艦如鯨啣尾來，要塞之砲成廢鐵，戰雲攘攘一月寒，不夜城頭天如漆，噫嘻賊氣一何驕，誇謂攻城月可掇，糾糾三將軍，聞言怒難遏，拔劍斫地吼如獅，蕞爾么麽爾何物，今日之事無他言，寗爲玉碎不瓦全，别妻揮手上馬去，民族生存唯向前，深宵傳令出虎幃，槍如聨珠砲如雷，疎鐘不語簫聲咽，昏夜漫漫飛劫灰，廬舍爲墟火半天，血流漂杵欲紫泥，一以當十聲勢闊，前仆後繼敵氣奪，敵機如鶻鶻時落，敵艦如鯨鯨身裂，利器疇言烟幕彈，渡河渡河盡魚斃，一戰先捷蕰藻浜，再戰又見捷江灣，三戰三捷廟行鎭，敵屍不收堆如山，又須十萬劍横磨，碧眼胡兒驚則那，十九軍非埀辮比，青白旗豈黃龍科，昔言華軍善屈服，此日方知昔言訛，嗚呼認仇作父當時任宰割，不屈男兒今日有南八，如何後援意不至，坐使蝦夷逞豕突，全師總感將軍威，謀國何人眞咄咄，不見蝦夷重洋隔，源源增援來倐忽，嗚呼援兵援兵，如何聞聲不見臨，抵抗抵抗，中樞何曾有决心，和戎自古誤大計，秦庭哭訴羞喑喑，狐裘蒙茸國三公，洛陽冠蓋徒淫淫，君不聞壯士沙塲爲國殤，臨死高呼中華民國萬歲聲，君不見後方折臂斷足衆勇士，創口未廖奮起欲從征，</p>

<h3>木材造肉的發明庶民</h3>
<p>木材造内，說來大家不以爲是神話就以爲是吹牛，其實都不是，這是一件科學上千眞萬確的事實，如不信，聽我道來··</p>
<p>當歐戰時，德國困於協約國的封鎖，從前仰給於外國的原料，特别是食料立告缺乏，於是國内的科學家，發狂似的爭先恐後來發明自製原料以濟要需，例如缺乏樹膠製造車胎等等之用，化學家就從一種不飽和的炭水化合物Isopren製出一種與樹膠相似的物質來代替了,　甘油不但製造炸藥之用,也有人藉細菌作用從澱粉裹製出甘油補充了,等等,只有營養料中之三大重要原素,澱粉質,脂肪質,蛋白質,　科學家爲想另外發理這三種物質的來源,不知費了幾許心力,終究因爲這個問題不能解决,國内食糧缺乏打了敗戰,</p>
<p>在那時,即一九一六年,海得堡的化學家Bergius白鳩斯氏也是研究這個問題之一，經他十四年的苦心思索和實地試騐，到一九三十年，硬把這問題實際解决了，即當時哄動全世的「白鳩斯的木材造肉的發明」是也</p>
<p>法用廉價木料或木削，浸於濃鹽酸内，經一定時間後，木材内所含三分二的纖微質完全變爲糖質，再用眞空蒸溜法將鹽酸原量柝出，以備二次之用，其次析出糖與少量醋酸，最後所餘佔全量三分一的物質Lignin可作燃料，</p>
<p>如此製出的糖，成本極廉，用以養猪，在較短的期内，就可長得肥而且大，將猪殺了，脂肪與蛋白質兩個問題，都可同時解决，</p>
<p>這個木材造肉的發明，曾經普魯士政府一度的試騐，成績非常之好，遂由普魯士的農林部長史台格提出議會討論，可惜在這尋不著出路的世界經濟恐慌情形裹，如白鳩斯木材造肉的方法實現，農民破產的更要不可思議的加多，恐將釀成農民的暴動，遂不爲當道所採納，被蘇俄以巨資把這木材造肉的專利法買去了，</p>
<p>一九三一年春，白鳩斯曾到蘇俄督造工廠，想不久的將來，美利堅的凍肉與豚脂，將不能再獨佔全世消塲吧，按白鳩斯敎授，因發明石炭取煤油與木材造肉二法，得了一九三一年全世界的諾貝爾獎金的榮譽</p>

<h3>一個傷兵的死吾</h3>
<p>這一天上午，我偕弟妹們將所有儲金買了些餅乾和襪子去慰問我忠勇奮鬥爲國捐軀的戰士。這種工作使我們感受無限的愉快，因爲這樣可以使我們出於眞誠的「愛」得貢獻於我民族最有覺悟而勇敢的壯士之前。</p>
<p>在紅十字會之一隅，從前是門診處，而今變爲我傷兵們的病室了。因爲醫院的病床不敷應用，於是我們受傷的兄弟們只得蓆地而臥了。我們都爲此凄慘的情景而傷心，尤其是我的小弟弟簡直流出涙來。我們慚愧的將所有的禮物分獻給他們，然而他們那種熱忱的感謝眞使我要感慚大哭。</p>
<p>他們的身體之一部或幾部裹扎着白色的綳帶，並染着點滴的血迹斑爛。他們有的在痛苦的呻吟着，有的在興奮的和同伴們談着殺敵的經過。忽然一陣慘痛的呼號起於屋裹最暗處，簡直使人不忍卒聞，於是我便匍伏的尋着聲音跑去，我遇着他的眼光在我身上悲哀的掃射。我撫摩着他，我哀憐着他，我想用我的嘴去吮盡他的痛苦，我切齒痛恨日帝國主義所加諸我們的殘暴。不久一個年輕的女看護拿了一袋冰來，慈藹的爲他敷在他的痛處。然而這並不能使他安靜。仍是那樣嘶着喉音狂號，於是我那可愛的妹妹便伏下身去以小手摩着他的臉無言的勉强對他苦笑，許久，她始終吐出一口嗚咽的哭聲。</p>
<p>「你受了傷，你··不能··呌喊的呀！····」</p>
<p>於是那重傷的戰士便弛緩的伸出手來緊緊的握着我妹妹的雙手許久，他搖着頭凄楚的說··</p>
<p>「啊丨我家裹也正有一個像你這樣的可愛的·······小·····妹妹的呢丨」兩粒豆大的涙珠同時流下。其後我說··（未完）</p>
<p>東西南北</p>
<h3>一角洋鈿小妮</h3>
<p>老早就動過了心，想去龍華看一看桃花，今天才得如願。</p>
<p>雖然不是前清的秀才，怕兵是一樣的。以前提起龍華，不知受了什麽影響地帶些懼意··現在又把他當作「夾岸桃花」的仙境。横直都是想像的，要看了才能知道。</p>
<p>在灰塵烟氣中奔走了許多的路，總算到了龍華。那時，天已經晚來了，心裹跳盪得非常利害，恨不得把風光一口氣呑在眼裹·，最初，是决定向龍華寺的大殿走去。</p>
<p>廟是看夠了的，没有什麽希罕。很有此摩登小姐在佛前膜拜，一如即「巴巴頭」的小脚婆婆一樣。</p>
<p>廟旁的園子裹有攝電影的，一位武俠明星很吃力地在抱起另一位女角，當即把被抱的人搬不起來的時候，攝影機是停住了聲音。</p>
<p>蜂擁着看攝電影的人，溝邊，樹上，任是怎樣都不能禁止他們的喧嘩，隨着「殺砍」的動作亂吼着。</p>
<p>廟裹是團過了一遍，除了殿前有兩株凋零的桃花外，一切都不如我先所猜想的。</p>
<p>很興會地跑到對街的塔中，一個人在那裹攔着，旁邊還有一位武裝的警士，他這樣地帶着訽問式的說道··「一角洋鈿。」</p>
<p>我們退到街心裹仰望塔上，彷佛那塔上的人是用了「一角洋鈿」在向我們顯</p>
<p>示驕傲。</p>
<p>桃花還是没有看到，問了問人，才知道附近有個五色桃花園的，跑去的時候，賣票的伸着手，「一角洋缳！」</p>
<p>戴着失望歸來，爲人們買回去的桃花，散落些瓣兒在地面上。也不知是美人面上掉下來的胭粉·，也不知是殷紅的血斑也不知那兒的幻象。</p>
<p>風好似還嘘送着聲音，耳邊是「一角洋鈿」「一角洋鈿」地响着。</p>

<h3>On Pacifying the Bandits</h3>
<p>The National Crisis Conference, long in the making, has now opened on the 7th of this month in Luoyang. Originally, over five hundred members were invited, but only a little over a hundred have attended, barely a third. This shows the dissatisfaction with this conference. The scope of discussion for this conference was pre-determined to be limited to three items: pacification, disaster relief, and defense against aggression. We are also not satisfied with this limitation. However, these three items of pacification, disaster relief, and defense against aggression are indeed major issues of the moment, so I would like to offer my views separately for the consideration of the nation. Let us first speak of "pacification."</p>
<p>Today's so-called "pacification" has the greatest objective of dealing with the Communist Party and the Red Army. Indeed, in recent years, the power of the Communist Party has become like a prairie fire, growing stronger day by day. People in general turn pale at the mention of it, constantly fearing imminent disaster. But where does the Communist Party come from? How has it spread so rapidly? This is the fundamental question that we should be exploring. To talk about "pacification" without exploring its root cause is like "climbing a tree to catch a fish." Those who talk about eliminating the Communist Party say that we should "cut off the circulation of Red bandit ideology, speech, and their publications." They also say we should "launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression to fundamentally eliminate them." This seems right, but in reality, it is not. We believe that today's Communist Party is different from the roving bandits like Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng at the end of the Ming Dynasty. They have a strict organization, a commonly believed ideology, a practical political program, and an international background. Their emergence and expansion are not accidental. As ordinary people imagine, the power of the Communist Party is growing due to the blind following of the poor workers and peasants. But where do these poor workers and peasants come from? From the darkness of politics, the endless internal strife, the oppressive taxes, the extortion of officials, and the exploitation of wealthy gentry. As a result, the national economy is increasingly declining, and people's livelihoods are becoming increasingly impoverished. People have no way out, so they resort to taking risks. It is the darkness of politics that breeds the Communist Party and increasingly fuels its power. In July of last year, Mr. Yang Xingfo also said in an article entitled "The Red Peril and China's Survival," "If the livelihood of farmers cannot be resolved and local politics cannot be improved, even without Red bandits, how can the country last? Moreover, local bullies, corruption, and poverty are factories for manufacturing the Red Peril." These words are worthy of our long-term consideration and deep thought.</p>
<p>Communism has now become a deeply rooted theory. All countries in the world can openly discuss it. Its dissemination and circulation cannot be suppressed by cutting off its publications or prohibiting its research. If a theory could be banned by power and cut off from circulation, then after Qin Shihuang's burying of scholars and burning of books, no one in the world would be able to read today. If the thoughts of young people could be controlled and imprisoned, then the Tsar should still be the monarch of Russia. If large-scale encirclement and suppression could eliminate them, then the people would not fear death, and severe punishments and penalties would have no effect. Last year, several encirclement and suppression campaigns mobilized hundreds of thousands of troops. What was the result? Perhaps the result of the suppression was to help expand their power. Why is it that the harassment of the army, the corruption of officials, and the false accusations of wealthy gentry all drove fish into deep waters and birds into dense forests?</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that today's "bandits" cannot be "eliminated" by "suppression." Thoughts cannot be imprisoned, nor can they be stopped by imprisonment. If we want to talk about "pacification," we must start by clarifying politics and establishing a democratic political system that suits the interests of the majority of the people. The establishment of democratic politics should proceed from solving the land problem to building a non-capitalist</p>
<p>socialism for the people's livelihood. Only then can the people live, society prosper, and social order be permanently stabilized. Other than this, we have not seen a way to pacification. If there is one, it should only be to indulge in oppressing the people.</p>
<h3>Postponement of the Ceasefire Conference General Assembly</h3>
<p>The question of the deadline to be handed over to the League of Nations to resolve the group committees continue to meet. The rumour that the ceasefire conference will be temporarily suspended has been briefly noted in this newspaper yesterday. Until yesterday afternoon, Zhang Sixu, the Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was ordered to formally notify the British Minister, Lampson, that the President of our Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei, is currently in Luoyang holding a National Crisis Conference, and that transportation between Shanghai and Luoyang is inconvenient, and that the government's instructions have not yet arrived in Shanghai. The ceasefire conference will be temporarily postponed and the Japanese side will be informed. The fifteenth ceasefire conference, scheduled to be held at the British Consulate General at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, was not held. The ceasefire conference was originally scheduled to be postponed for one day and will be reopened today. However, whether it will be reopened today is still uncertain.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Postponement of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>According to unofficial sources obtained by our newspaper reporter, although the military subcommittee of the ceasefire conference decided to meet as usual, the General Assembly may be suspended for several days. The General Assembly was to conclude after the issue of the deadline for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops to their original defense positions before January 28 had not been satisfactorily resolved. Our government has long fully trusted the League of Nations to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, and the Shanghai Ceasefire Conference is also proceeding based on the resolution of the League of Nations Council on March 4. Now that the Special Committee of the League of Nations Council has met yesterday, it should hand over the issue of the final withdrawal deadline of Japanese troops, which has not been resolved here, to the League of Nations for a fair resolution in accordance with the original policy. Foreign Minister Luo Wengan is reported to have instructed Yan Huijing, the representative in Geneva, to submit the case when the Special Committee of the League of Nations Council meets. Therefore, the date of the reopening of the ceasefire conference here depends on the situation in Geneva. The military subcommittee decided to continue its work during the suspension of the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Representatives Inspect Locations</h3>
<p>The Military Subcommittee met yesterday because the inspection of the withdrawal areas such as Jiangwan and Yinxianggang and the division of detailed locations were not as difficult as in the Wusong area. Therefore, the representatives of China, Japan, and friendly countries gathered at the British Consulate at 9:00 a.m. to prepare to depart, but the plan was temporarily changed again. The three parties, China, Japan, and friendly countries, sent four representatives to inspect. They were Zhang Yidong, Secretary of the 19th Route Army, Nishimura, Staff Officer of the Japanese side, Li Gang, Aide-de-Camp, and Pennaveta, French Military Attaché on the neutral side. The four people took three cars, departed from Hongkou, and went to Jiangwan Wanguo Sports Ground to Yinhangzhen, and then to the Yinxiang area for inspection. They returned at about 12:00 noon. Then our representative reported to Chief of Staff Huang Qiang. According to British Attaché Sang Hill, Zhabei is not very important. If inspection is required, representatives will also be sent. If the representatives encounter any difficulties, all the representatives will depart again. Mr. Sang said at the end that he is a neutral person, and his aim is to be impartial in all places. Therefore, when he inspected Wusong last time, the Japanese reporter was stopped and turned back halfway.</p>
<h3>Subcommittee Meeting Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The subcommittee meeting was held at the British Consulate at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. The attending representatives were Huang Qiang and Guo Dehua from our side, Tashiro, Nishimura, Abe, and Kajiwara from the Japanese side, Sang Hill, British Attaché, Trelaister, American Attaché, Pennaveta, French Attaché, and Fallatini, Italian Attaché. They discussed the issue of the Chinese troops stationed in Pudong and south of the Suzhou River, and asked our representatives whether the Chinese troops in Pudong and Nanshi should be interfered with when the Japanese troops withdraw. Our representative immediately replied that what is being discussed now is the withdrawal of Japanese troops, not the issue of China's sovereignty. This is far from the basic principle of withdrawal and cannot be discussed. Thereupon, the Japanese representatives had a long debate with our side, and the dispute lasted for a long time without being resolved. Then, the representatives of friendly countries proposed a compromise solution to mediate, but both sides still had a fierce debate on this compromise solution, which was unresolved for a long time. The meeting ended at 5:20 p.m. and was scheduled to continue the discussion at 3:00 p.m. today.</p>
<h3>Starting to Draft a Plan</h3>
<p>In yesterday's subcommittee meeting, for the area of ​​Japanese troop withdrawal in Jiangwan and Yinxianggang, the US representative drafted the designated area line, and then submitted it to the Chinese and Japanese representatives for a decision. The plan is currently in progress.</p>
<h3>Subcommittee Meeting Bulletin</h3>
<p>The Military Subcommittee issued a public statement last night stating that the temporary locations for Japanese troops to withdraw have been inspected by neutral representatives and have been approved by the Subcommittee. The meeting continued in the afternoon to discuss the defense zones of Chinese troops and made some progress. The meeting was adjourned until 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Ceasefire Negotiations to be Handled by the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Yan to the League of Nations for handling Yan Huijing claims that the compromise solution is difficult to accept. The League of Nations will consider new recommendations. The National News Agency, Geneva, 10th. China's chief representative Yan Huijing said today that he would ask the 19th Committee of the League of Nations to pay attention to the Shanghai ceasefire negotiations that failed to implement the conditions of the League of Nations resolution. He also said that the so-called compromise solution in Shanghai last Saturday was difficult to accept because it did not stipulate the deadline for the Japanese army to withdraw from China. Therefore, he believes that the League of Nations will be forced to consider new recommendations.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Various Groups Visited Guo Taiqi Yesterday</h3>
<p>Oppose the humiliating agreement. The representatives of the Shanghai Chinese Student Patriotic Association, the Chinese National Self-Determination Association, the Chinese Youth Patriotic Association, and the Overseas Chinese Compatriots Association, including Shen Zurong, Wang Zhisheng, Yan Jin, Zhang Juansheng, Deng Cihou, Li Qiaozhi, and Dai Tiandao, went to the Foreign Affairs Office at 9:00 a.m. yesterday to question Representative Guo on several points in writing: ㈠ Why did you agree to the Japanese army occupying the four key areas of Jiangwan, Zhabei, Wusong, and Yinxiang, and the so-called complete withdrawal when the six inner areas return to normal traffic conditions? How could Representative Guo accept this deceptive and misleading agreement, and is it true that he will sign it this afternoon? Is Representative Guo willing to sell out the country? ㈡ Is it true that Shanghai will be established as a free city? Is this news of the destruction of our territory and the deprivation of our people's qualifications true? ㈢ The situation of our army stationed in Pudong and south of the Suzhou River has nothing to do with the negotiation of soldiers. Japan has unreasonably inquired about it. Why did Representative Guo agree to report it? Everywhere is humiliation and surrender. Why is it so incompetent? ㈣ When I visited Representative Guo last time, I proposed that we oppose any negotiations until all the violent Japanese naval, land, and air forces have completely withdrawn. At that time, Representative Guo fully adopted this proposal and said that he was willing to resign if there were any difficulties. Now that I heard that the humiliating agreement is about to be signed, why does Representative Guo covet his position and be a tool for selling out the country? The original plan was to present it in person, but Representative Guo was out on official business. Zhang Sixu, Director of the Intelligence Department, reported on behalf of him until 12:00 noon: ㈠ Today's meeting is cancelled. ㈡ The Shanghai case has been submitted to the government for resolution by the League of Nations. The representatives were very angry when they heard this and left without any results.</p>
<h3>Collection of Military News from the Front</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 11th, special telegram: 60-70% of the refugees in Kunshan have returned home. On the Taicang front, there is only contact with sentries. The front is calm.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Cause Unbearable Harassment</h3>
<p>Kunshan, 11th, special telegram: Japanese soldiers in Yuewang City ordered residents to provide food and forced all shops to open and change to hang the Rising Sun flag. Most residents avoided the Japanese soldiers searching the city.</p>
<p>Suzhou, 11th, special telegram: Enemy troops in Yuewang City forced shops to hang the Rising Sun flag and forced the people to provide chicken, beef, and supplies. More than 150 enemies between Xintang City and Qianjing built trenches and laid electrical networks. All the wheat in the area has been taken by the Japanese as horse feed. There is no hope for a harvest.</p>
<h3>Londoners Predict the Future of Shanghai Negotiations</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: The breakdown of the Sino-Japanese negotiations in Shanghai is not surprising to London political circles. The authorities believe that the demands made by China and Japan are completely irreconcilable, and it is almost certain that they will become a deadlock. However, it is expected that the breakdown of the negotiations will not lead to a resumption of hostilities. Now it is expected that the failure of the discussions in Shanghai will only be moved to Geneva for discussion. However, it is not possible to predict whether Geneva will succeed. Japan's demands for several guarantees to prevent the recurrence of the situation that caused this war are not considered unfair by Londoners. Political circles are puzzled by China's failure to accept the proposal that would allow the Japanese army to withdraw completely.</p>
<h3>Sichuan General Ren Zhuozhang Donates Silver to Console</h3>
<p>Feng Yong Returns to Ping Today. Suzhou, 11th, special telegram: Sichuan General Ren Zhuozhang sent a telegram to the 19th Route Army saying that due to environmental reasons, he could not exert his strength to drive forward. He is willing to donate 5% of the monthly salary of his subordinates starting from April and remit it to the Bank of China to serve as a reward. The 19th Route Army has replied with thanks, but is unwilling to accept his donation. Kunshan, 11th, special telegram: Feng Yong is scheduled to go to Ping on the 12th.</p>

Election and discussion of important proposals,</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Xu Jiqing delivered an opening speech, saying: Representatives of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, representatives of the Municipal Government, distinguished representatives, this year's representative assembly and the representative assembly of the Republic of China in 17 years have the same special importance in the history of this association and the history of Shanghai. The representative assembly of the 17th year was the first representative assembly in the history of this association. Its task was to elect the second board committee and join the Public Concession Municipal Council, creating a new record in the history of the city. The task of this year's representative assembly is to legally and rationally safeguard the prosperity of Shanghai, which has been directly and indirectly destroyed by Japanese soldiers, to the point of extinction. In modern independent countries, the existence of concessions should not be allowed legally and rationally. However, the status of the concession is not what it is now, and its return should have a transitional period. Although it cannot be said that it must be decades, a period of five or ten years may be acceptable to us, because drastic changes are not as good as evolution. People who have relations with the concession are always worried about the safety of the concession being sabotaged by others, and actively prevent its sabotage. Therefore, for eighty-eight years, its neutrality has been maintained. We can deeply believe that foreigners and even our compatriots believe that the concession is a safer area. However, from 11:25 p.m. on January 28 this year until today, this trust in the safety of the concession has been completely destroyed by foreign troops. These foreign troops are not the troops of a sovereign country, but the troops of one of the countries related to the concession, namely Japan. This is not what we could have expected, and perhaps not what people related to the Japanese would have imagined. From this, we can see that world affairs are impermanent, human affairs are unstable, and disasters often come from preconceived notions. However, after the Japanese troops used force on the night of September 18 last year, after Gong occupied our Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, Shanghai was already harboring chaos. This association has repeatedly notified the Municipal Council in advance to take precautions. Our important evidence is that the Japanese army occupied the Hongkou Police Station because the Municipal Council detained the surging Japanese Marines, and the matter was resolved after an apology. It is known that the Japanese have no respect for the position of the concession. The concession serving as a base for operations, even if the defense forces of the related countries are sufficient, they are also unable to do anything. If you don't believe it, please read President Fei Xindun's explanation of the neutrality of the concession. The explanation said that the concession is not a country and has no sovereignty. Therefore, the Municipal Council is not responsible for the destruction of neutrality. The responsible parties are the governments of the related countries. We believe that this explanation is extremely legal, extremely reasonable, and extremely factual. However, the fact of the concession is like this, and the method of maintaining safety, like the safety of the past eighty-eight years, can be maintained without being destroyed is really lucky and not a human plan. All related parties should be able to realize this by now. The concession is related to more than one country. If one country uses the concession as a base for operations today, and the Municipal Council is unable to resist the defense forces of the related countries, even if it is able to resist, it will not dare to move before receiving orders from its own government. And the governments of the related countries also have different relationships and goodwill, and they will never be willing to fight with the destroyer for the concession, a small piece of land in our country's territory. If we speculate like this, who can guarantee that the integrity of the concession will not be shaken at any time? From the above, this year's representative assembly has a heavy mission. We should do our best to use our intelligence, follow the law, follow the truth, use the spirit of peaceful struggle, and seek to maintain safety, so that the declining prosperity will not be destroyed again, and seek to revive it. As for the important work of the previous session of this association, there is a special subject that will not be repeated. However, there is now a sad report that Xiang Songmao, one of the creators of this association, has been missing in the area that has always been considered safe, and his life and death are still unknown. In addition, I don't know how many residents in the boundary are missing or have been killed. If so many foreigners were missing or killed in our Chinese administrative jurisdiction, what would be the world's public opinion attacking and blaming us? Therefore, it further proves that no matter where, the actions of warlords are despised by any civilized person. Alas,</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Chinese Director</p>
<h3>Report of the Chinese Committee Members</h3>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng, representative of all the Chinese directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, reported: We, the undersigned, were elected by the previous session of the representative assembly on April 10th of last year to serve as directors and committee members of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. Now, after a year, our term is complete. Today, we are pleased to attend the first meeting of the twenty-first annual representative assembly. We respectfully present the following report on our participation in the major municipal affairs of the past year: 1. Allocation of Administrative Committees and Increase of Chinese Committee Members: The number of administrative committees established by the Municipal Council has increased or decreased over the years. The current session has a total of twelve committees. The allocation of Chinese and foreign committee members and their numbers are as follows: Finance Committee: a total of seven members, two Chinese members, held by Director Xu Xinliu and Committee Member Qin Runqing; Police Committee: a total of five members, two Chinese members, held by Director Yu Qiaqing and Committee Member Chen Tingrui; Public Works Committee: a total of six members, two Chinese members, held by Director Yuan Ludeng and Committee Member Lin Kanghou; Staff Committee: a total of six members, two Chinese members, held by Director Liu Hongsheng and Committee Member Li Fusun; Public Utilities Committee: a total of six members, two Chinese members, held by Director Hu Mengjia and Committee Member Yunzhai; Health Committee: a total of seven members, three Chinese members, held by Director Liu Hongsheng, Committee Member Qian Longzhang, and Doctor [blank] E; Transportation Committee: a total of six members, two Chinese members, held by Committee Members Wu Yunzhai and Chen Tingrui; Education Committee: a total of nine members, four Chinese members, held by Director Yuan Ludeng, Committee Member Lin Kanghou, President of Shanghai University Liu Zhan'en, and Vice President of Great China University Ou Yuanhuai; Music Committee: all previous members were foreigners. This session added one Chinese member, making a total of four members, held by Huang Jinwu, Director of Academic Affairs of the National Conservatory of Music; Library Committee: all previous members were foreigners. This session added one Chinese member, "making a total of five members," held by Wang [blank] Wang, General Manager of the Commercial Press; Film Censorship Committee: a total of eight members, two Chinese members, originally held by Xia Niuhuizhen and He Deben. Later, due to the resignation of Ms. Xia and Mr. He, they were replaced by Chen Panyumei and Zhu Boquan; House Assessment Committee: a total of five members, one Chinese member, held by Yan Fang of the Shanghai Real Estate Association. In addition, the following committees were temporarily established due to administrative needs: Waterworks Case Committee: a total of nine members, four Chinese members, in addition to the original Public Utilities Committee members Hu Mengjia and Wu Yunzhai as ex-officio members, the then Director of the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, Guo Chengen, and Xiao Qingyun, a technician from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, together with American expert Hill and four other foreign members; Hospital Committee: a total of twelve members, held by Doctors Niu Huisheng and Yan Fuqing; Doctor Registration Committee: a total of eight members, two Chinese members, held by Doctors Niu Huisheng and Xu Naili; Intelligence Committee: a total of seven members, two Chinese members, held by Wang Yingbin of Shen Bao and Dong XianGuang of Da Lu Bao; Chinese Private School Subsidy Committee: This committee was proposed by the Education Committee specifically to discuss the allocation of subsidies for Chinese private schools. The committee has ten members, all of whom are Chinese. In addition to the Education Committee members Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Liu Zhan'en, and Ou Yuanhuai as ex-officio members, it is held by educational experts Wei Que, Liao Shicheng, Ge Zulan, Cao Yunxiang, and Shen Yang Baokang, and Xia Niuhuizhen. From the organization of the above committees, a significant point to note is that at the beginning of Chinese participation in municipal administration, there were only three directors and six committee members. Now, the number of directors has increased to five, and the number of committee members has increased from six to forty. However, except for the six seats elected by this assembly, all others are recommended by the Chinese directors and appointed by the Municipal Council. Now, all committees of the Municipal Council have Chinese participation, which cannot be said to be an obvious improvement. Moreover, Chinese staff members are gradually being selected for middle and senior positions. If the national political situation improves and citizens continue to work hard, the status of Chinese directors in municipal administration will advance with the times. (II) Appointment of Senior Chinese Staff and Establishment of the Intelligence Department: The selection of Chinese staff to fill senior positions in the Municipal Council is not only the general wish of the Chinese residents but also the demand of the times. The report of the Salary Committee of the previous year proposed the establishment of an assistant to the General Office to assist in municipal affairs. The Board of Directors has already approved this and appointed Chairman MacNaughten, President Fessenden, and Directors Tongben, Qiaqing, and Xin Da to form a special committee to discuss the title, functions, and candidates. After deliberation, it was decided to appoint a Chinese person as assistant and to establish a municipal advisor, also to be filled by a Chinese person, with a position above the paid staff of the Municipal Council, to be consulted by the Board of Directors from time to time. It was decided to appoint Wu Jingxiong, the former President of the Shanghai Provisional Court, as advisor, and He DeKui, Secretary of this Assembly, as assistant. The Board of Directors approved the appointments, and they took office on June 1st. Both gentlemen are knowledgeable and capable and have won the trust of the public, making them suitable for these positions. For other administrative departments, the promotion of existing Chinese staff and the recruitment of Chinese trainees have been gradually implemented, and a savings program for Chinese staff has also been drafted and adopted by the Finance Department. In addition, in order to impart municipal knowledge and make residents understand the administrative situation of the Council, the Municipal Council, on the suggestion of the Intelligence Committee, established an Intelligence Department and hired an Englishman, Sell, as director, and appointed one Chinese and one Japanese specialist each. Zhu Minzhang, former Counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was appointed as the Chinese specialist. Furthermore, the Municipal Council Gazette and the annual report were translated into Chinese last year for the convenience of the citizens. (III) Chinese Education Facilities: The main points regarding Chinese education administration this year are: (1) Subsidies for Chinese Private Schools: The Municipal Council annually allocates funds to provide subsidies to Chinese private primary and secondary schools within the concession that are well-managed and have financial difficulties. A committee of Chinese education experts has been hired to discuss and distribute the subsidies. The regulations are being drafted and should be implemented soon. (2) Promotion of Chinese Education: Last year, the Chinese Education Committee proposed a plan to expand Chinese education within the concession, proposing to establish sixteen Chinese primary schools and two girls' middle schools within eight years, starting from 1931. The principles were approved by the Board of Directors, and the first year's construction funds were approved by the taxpayers' meeting. One girls' middle school was established last autumn, and primary schools in the western and eastern districts are under construction. By 1932, two more primary schools should be established. Houses have been rented and will be opened in the spring and autumn seasons, and land will be purchased successively for permanent school buildings. In addition, Chinese teachers have been added to the four Chinese Children's Public Schools, and they will be gradually converted into new-style middle schools. Currently, there are four Chinese primary schools, one girls' middle school, and four boys' middle schools within the concession. (IV) Increase of Chinese Land Committee Members: According to the Land Regulations, the Municipal Council established a Land Committee of three members, one appointed by the Municipal Council, one elected by the Western Ratepayers Association, and one elected by the foreign property owners, with a term of one year and paid a stipend. The Municipal Council, according to the power conferred by the regulations, used private land for public facilities, health facilities, and public works. If the landowner does not agree or there is a dispute over compensation, it is submitted to the Land Committee for resolution and then sent to the courts of the relevant countries for execution. The Land Committee has always been composed of Westerners. Last year, the Board of Directors decided to add two Chinese members to represent the Chinese ratepayers and Chinese property owners, respectively, together with the three Western members, making a total of five members. However, the number of members and responsibilities of the Land Committee are clearly stipulated in the Land Regulations and cannot be easily changed. Therefore, the Board of Directors decided that the addition of Chinese members must be done through legal procedures. The Municipal Council has now drafted the procedures for adding Chinese directors, and after approval by this session of the Taxpayers' Meeting and the Chinese and Western authorities, it will have legal effect. The Chinese members should be elected by the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the Real Estate Association, respectively, to comply with the regulations. Many Chinese people within the concession hold property, so this move also respects property rights and is a way to achieve practical cooperation. (V) Completion of the Feetham Report: The Municipal Council hired Mr. Feetham, a judge of the Supreme Court of South Africa, two years ago to investigate the administrative situation of the concession for a period of one year. He drafted a three-volume report, which was completed last summer in July. The report is particularly rich in the collection of historical facts about Shanghai, and the description of various current systems (such as Daoqi) is also detailed. However, the conclusion regrettably fails to fully meet the wishes of the Chinese people. However, the diligence of his investigation and the specialization of his work are also admirable. We believe that Mr. Feetham's report is currently Mr. Feetham's personal opinion, and the Municipal Council's hiring of Mr. Feetham is only in the nature of a consultant. This must be clearly stated. (VI) Review of the Waterworks Price Increase Case: The waterworks price increase case has come to an end after the Municipal Council decided to hire Chinese and foreign experts to review the entire management of the waterworks company and formed a waterworks case committee to seek a solution. The Chinese expert was Guo Chengen, Director of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration, and the Western expert was Hill, an American waterworks engineer. The Real Estate Association also recommended Xiao Qingyun, a technician from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, as a representative to participate in the committee. Hill's report was published on October 10th of last year. The main points advocated that the capital of the waterworks company should be calculated in silver, and the company should be responsible for the gains and losses of exchange. The interest rate should be 8.5%. Director Xu Xinliu [blank] believed that it would be appropriate to use water meters for calculation in the future. The new water price rate has been negotiated by the Municipal Council and the waterworks company. The details have been published in the gazette on December 11th. Hill's report has not yet been adopted. The size of the estimated silver capital is very important to the users. Residents should study it carefully. (VII) Protest Against the Japanese Military's Violation of the Concession's Neutrality: On the night of January 28th, the Japanese military attacked Zhabei from Hongkou, and the Shanghai war broke out. The concession was originally a neutral area, but the Japanese military used it as a base of operations. Therefore, we formally protested to the Municipal Council and the leaders of the Shanghai Consular Corps the next day. However, the police force of the Municipal Council was only sufficient to maintain law and order and could not use force to stop the Japanese military's combat operations. Moreover, the troops stationed in Shanghai by various countries each had their own national policies. Therefore, the municipal power in the Hongkou area was horizontally occupied for almost two months. Our army respected the neutrality of the concession and did not have a single soldier enter. The Municipal Council declared martial law throughout the city for more than a month during the Shanghai war, cutting off traffic at night. The Board of Directors held daily meetings and only recently announced the lifting of martial law. (VIII) Maintenance of the Old Tax Rate: Last year, the Municipal Council believed that the price of gold was soaring and expenses were huge, and the budget was difficult to balance. There was a proposal to increase the tax rate by two tenths. Later, various administrative departments vigorously implemented austerity measures, the exchange rate situation gradually improved, and the regular and special expenditures in the budget were reallocated. Therefore, at the time of the final accounts, there was actually a surplus of 350,000 taels in 1931. Since the Shanghai Incident, commerce has declined, and the taxpayers' economic ability has been greatly affected after the war. The Municipal Council, in order to take into account the difficulties of the people, decided to maintain the old tax rate and vigorously implement economic policies to maintain the balance of the 1932 budget. This is something that can be comforting to everyone. The above eight matters are worth mentioning in the Municipal Council's administration during our term of office. We have briefly listed the beginning and end and reported them to you. There are many other routine matters that will not be repeated. We have been entrusted with the heavy responsibility by the Chinese ratepayers, and we have worked hard for the happiness of the locality and the legal rights involved, hoping to make a small contribution. However, we are still ashamed that we have not lived up to the expectations of the society and the encouragement of you all. We hope that you will understand.</p>

Japanese residents who came to Shanghai by ship from Japan, such as the Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru, arrive every two days, with five or six hundred people arriving in Shanghai each time. The number of Japanese in Hongkou has also increased greatly. Yesterday, Japanese residents in Shanghai publicly elected representatives to meet with Shirakawa, Shigemitsu, Ueda, Nomura, etc., requesting that since the September 18th Incident, Japanese merchants have suffered huge losses due to Chinese resistance to Japanese goods. If the resistance to goods is not permanently abolished this time, Japanese residents will have no foothold in Shanghai. They also proposed that Shanghai be designated as a permanent safe zone, that is, Chinese troops should not be allowed to station there. Shirakawa, etc. have already received this petition.</p>

<h3>Feng Ziyou's Geng Telegram</h3>
<p>Feng Ziyou sent a telegram to the National Government, The Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang in Luoyang, and the members of the National Government, Since the September 18th tragedy occurred, the people of the country have blamed the Kuomintang rulers for the result of years of civil war. The Kuomintang's credibility with the people of the country has almost gone bankrupt. This is undeniable. I believe that in order for the Kuomintang to remedy its past mistakes and restore its reputation, it should immediately implement three things: First, in accordance with the revolutionary strategy of the Tongmenghui, it should lift the provisions of the Provisional Constitution and the Founding Program's political tutelage period within a limited period of six years, and announce that the day of the Nanjing Capital in March 1927 will be the beginning of the political tutelage, and that the political tutelage will be cancelled and the Constitution will be promulgated by April 1933. The procedure is to complete local autonomy and draft a draft Constitution within nine months from May 1932, and to convene a National Representative Assembly to formulate the Constitution and create a Constitutional Government within one year. Second, in order to prepare for constitutional government and cope with national crises, the country should concentrate national talents and organize a national defense government, and there should be no restrictions on freedom of speech, publication, and association that do not violate the Three People's Principles. The above is presented in the hope that it will be adopted. The future of the Republic of China and the reputation of the people's party depend on it. Please examine it. Feng Ziyou, Geng,</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Comfort Mission Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>This time, the violent Japanese invaded Shanghai, and our loyal and brave soldiers on the front line bravely resisted, bringing glory to the nation. The people of Shaanxi heard of it and were very impressed. For the sake of material and spiritual assistance, the Comfort Association was specially organized by various groups and organs to collect comfort items, and Bai Yuyu, Xie Xiangyin, Lin Zuohai, and others were publicly elected to come and comfort the soldiers on the front line and the wounded soldiers in the rear. They are currently coming to Shanghai from Hangzhou and are in the process of arranging the comfort program.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Zhejiang Public Association to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Letter from the Zhejiang Public Association to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Dear Sir, The violent Japanese, indulging in their military dream, use airplanes, warships, tanks, bombs, cannons, poisonous gas, and smoke bombs to massacre the people of Liaoning and Shanghai. We have no weapons and can only resolutely and permanently refuse to use Japanese goods as our only weapon. However, since the anti-Japanese work has stopped, a large amount of Japanese goods has been smuggled into the country. Our business colleagues should each adhere to their conscience, supervise each other, and strive to resist, no matter how they are tempted or threatened, and resist with a spirit of non-compromise. The Sino-Japanese armistice negotiations are especially unreliable. We will never cooperate with them until the Japanese troops have completely withdrawn from Chinese territory. Your association is in charge of the commercial center and has always sympathized with the anti-Japanese cause. It has already established an economic severance committee. Your patriotic enthusiasm is truly admirable. You should continue to proceed, set a date for the meeting as soon as possible, and convene all trade associations to explain the real interests and advise their respective trades. Do not import Japanese goods again. If there is any double-dealing, once discovered, each trade should formulate its own disciplinary measures and severely punish them. In this way, commerce can avoid disturbances, and the anti-Japanese movement can avoid being interrupted. In short, the country may have humiliating conditions, but the people must not be without the spirit of struggle. The situation is critical and urgent. I hope you will be aware of it. I look forward to it. Sincerely, Zhejiang Public Association.</p>
<h3>Petition Representatives from Beiping Arrive in Shanghai</h3>

Mr. Ling has already arrived in Beijing a few days ago to pay respects to the authorities and came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday.</p>
<h3>Jinan University Establishes a School in Guangdong</h3>
<p>All Departments in Guangzhou Have Commenced Classes; President Zheng is About to Return to Shanghai.  Since the outbreak of war, approximately 300 students of National Jinan University who were in war zones left the school and returned to Guangdong. Initially, they planned to audit classes at Zhongshan University.  However, students from various war-zone schools who came to Guangdong from Shanghai requested to audit, reaching over a thousand people.  This made it impossible for Zhongshan University to accommodate them. To address the academic needs of students remaining in Guangdong, President Zheng personally traveled south last month to discuss relief measures with President Zou of Zhongshan University.  President Zou graciously granted the university's facilities for use.</p>

<h3>Wei Daoming, Zheng Yuxiu, and Others Sail Overseas</h3>
<p>To Return with Wang Chonghui Within Six Months. Zheng Yuxiu, Wei Daoming, Mrs. Wang Chonghui, Mrs. Kong Xiangxi (Soong Ailing), and others sailed from Shanghai yesterday at 9 AM aboard the Italian Empress, bound for overseas.  Those seeing them off at the Xinguancheng Wharf included Li Shizeng, Yang Zhaoyun, Liang Renjie, Shen Jiayi, Zhou Xianjue Ying Shi, Shen Xiqing, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, and dozens of others.

<h3>Prohibition of Unauthorized Seizure of Civilian Ships</h3>
<p>The 19th Route Army Takes Care of Transportation and Shows Consideration for the People. The Shanghai Office of the General Headquarters of the 19th Route Army stated that since the outbreak of military affairs, due to frequent transportation needs for military purposes, steamships were required.  The Shanghai Municipal Bureaus' Joint Office was entrusted to hire steamships and barges, providing reasonable fares and food expenses to maintain them. Recently, it has been found that military police in the interior sometimes seize ships on the pretext, causing commercial ships to hesitate and boatmen to flee, hindering transportation.  This is extremely serious. Failure to correct this will not only impede military operations but also cut off public transportation. Recently, some unscrupulous police stations have even used this as an opportunity for extortion, which is even more hateful.  A letter has been sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to instruct all county public security bureaus and sub-bureaus that any ships of this army should be inspected and released, and civilian ships should not be seized without authorization.</p>
<h3>Four Organizations Send Letters Requesting Expedited Trial of the Wu Case</h3>
<p>Requesting Justice Be Upheld. The Joint Association of Middle School Faculty, the National Endeavor Association, Shanghai Women's Middle School, the Film Education Association, and other four organizations stated that although lawyer Wu Mai was illegally beaten by the Public Security Bureau and a lawsuit was filed with the local court, there has been no indication of progress. Therefore, they jointly sent a letter to the local court and the bar association yesterday, urging an inquiry. The original text reads: "Esteemed sirs, since lawyer Wu Mai was illegally beaten and seriously injured by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau on March 12th, a request was made to your court to investigate and prosecute in accordance with the law. People from all walks of life believe that this matter can reach a fair conclusion through the law. However, a considerable amount of time has passed, and your court has not yet taken any thorough investigation measures. We do not know why. The public is indignant about this case, and the facts are all there. Is it that your court, as a sacred judicial institution, cannot exercise its powers, or that the law cannot be applied to the officials of the Public Security Bureau? Today, people are wise and clear. Therefore, we specially write to request your court to uphold justice, implement the spirit of rule of law, severely punish the illegal acts of the Public Security Bureau, protect human rights, and comfort public opinion. With sincere wishes, we hope to receive a reply. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Local Court."</p>
<p>Another letter was sent to the Shanghai Bar Association: "Esteemed sirs, it is reported that your association has publicly appointed lawyers Wu Jingyi, Lian Kui, Wu Shou Gong, Shen Junru, Yu Zhongluo, Pan Zhenya, and Shan Yuhua to file a lawsuit regarding the illegal insults to lawyer Wu Mai by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. This shows that your association values the rule of law and admires justice. However, a considerable amount of time has passed, and the court has not given any indication. Could it be that the sacred law cannot be applied to the officials of the Public Security Bureau? This is extremely shocking. Wu is a member of your association and should be protected by your association's powers and the laws of the country. If officials are so rampant, the law cannot take effect, and the court, as a judicial institution, cannot execute the sacred law, then what is the point of so-called human rights? Therefore, we specially write to request your association to uphold justice and thoroughly investigate the matter with a fearless spirit. We hope to receive a reply. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Bar Association."</p>

<h3>Customs Patrol Team Protects Fishing Boats</h3>
<p>Wang Shiqin, captain of the Jiangsu's five district salt affairs customs sea patrol team, has been very serious about customs enforcement since taking office. Recently, fearing that unscrupulous people may extort and harass good people during the fishing season, he issued a notice to his subordinates to strictly enforce the law. The notice is recorded below: Notice regarding customs patrol work. It is known that the duty of this team is to enforce customs laws and increase revenue. Since taking office, this captain has prioritized honesty and eliminating malpractices. However, with so many members of this team, there are inevitably some who engage in improper behavior. Now that the fishing season is approaching, it is feared that unscrupulous merchants may collude with team members to harass fishermen or abuse their authority to impose unreasonable fines. Therefore, a notice is issued to all personnel to be aware that if any fishing boat is found to be smuggling illicit salt, it will be dealt with according to the law without any unreasonable harassment or disturbance to the fishing industry. After this notice, if any of the above situations occur, the victims are allowed to report the perpetrators by name, and a strict investigation will be conducted without any leniency. All must strictly abide by this notice.</p>

However, the defendants in the same case, Ma Zhiyun, Zhang Yuting (aka Zhang Longfa), Xing Genda, and Shen Liansheng, are still at large and still working in the police force. The family of Xu Yan are unwilling to let this go, and based on information, they reported it to the court. The court has ordered the arrest of the defendants, but they cannot be found and they have been ordered to be wanted.</p>

<h3>Large Number of Male and Female Robbers Arrested</h3>
<p>A total of twelve people, most of whom were arrested in hotels. Lu Liankui, the Chief Detective of the General Patrol Room, learned on the 9th of this month that a large group of robbers was hiding in room 158 of the Sutai Hotel on Hubei Road. He led Detective Liu Shaokui, Tang Jian, Detective Feng Zhiming, Wu Hanzhang, and Western Detective Xie Men to secretly arrest robber Qian Ahai. He then successively arrested accomplices Ye Arong, Bao Yongmei, Miao Yishun, Yao Asan (aka Xiao Amao), Xu Ziqing, Shen Ada, Bao Zhangmin, Pan Ayuan, Pan Gushi, and prostitute Li Aiyuan, Li Xiaomei, and others from room 240 of the Andong Hotel on Hubei Road, 303 Dongzilaihuo Street, and 55 Tongkang Lane on Huasheng Road in the French Concession, totaling thirteen men and women. Three pistols and thirty-five bullets were found under the floor in the room of Yao Asan and Pan Ayuan in Tongkang Lane. All were taken to the patrol room and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the first criminal court of the First Special District Court. According to the patrol room's lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, due to the short time, the patrol room had not yet conducted a detailed investigation, so he requested that the defendants be detained. Judge Qian Hongye questioned each defendant about their age and origin, and ordered that they be detained and interrogated again in seven days.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Arrested for Extortion</h3>
<p>Husband sends extortion letter demanding a thousand gold coins; wife loiters on the left side of the road waiting for the money. Zhang Songzhou, an employee of Datong Bank, who lives at 27 Xinxin Street, Nanshi, suddenly received an extortion letter from a gang in March of this year, intending to extort 1,000 yuan. Zhang reported the situation to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and requested an arrest. Due to the situation at the time, Zhang Songzhou moved to the French Concession. The gang did not know where Zhang had moved, so they changed the extortion letter and sent it to Zhang's office at 6 Jiujiang Road in the Public Concession. The letter stated that the money should be sealed in an envelope and sent to a poor woman on the corner of Xizang Road and Fuzhou Road at 1 PM on the 9th of this month, and an additional small foreign coin (20 cents) should be paid. Zhang reported the situation to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which sent Detective She Maolong to secretly wait at the location with Detective Li Shugui of the Laozao Patrol Room on the 9th. Detective Li hid on the balcony of the nearby Tianchan Teahouse and observed. After a while, he saw a Jiangbei woman named Liu Shi, dressed in rags, loitering and peeping, as if waiting for something. Detective She stepped forward and handed the two foreign cents and the envelope containing 180 yuan of counterfeit coins to her. She took them and walked north, turning them over to her husband, Liu Enhong, at the corner of Xizang Road and Hankou Road. The detectives immediately arrested Liu and his wife and took them to the patrol room for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The patrol room lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, detailed the case, stating that there was a jurisdictional issue. After receiving the extortion letter, the victim, Zhang Songzhou, went to Nanshi and reported the matter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which handled the case. Due to the impact of the war, he moved to the concession, and the criminals also changed their strategy, sending the letter to 6 Jiujiang Road in the concession, and the agreed location for the contact was also in the concession. Therefore, both the court and the local court have the right to handle this case. The patrol room initially intended to prosecute based on Article 370, Section 3, and Article 319 of the Criminal Law. Now, for the sake of cooperation between the Public Security Bureau and the patrol room, the patrol room is willing to waive the right to prosecute, and does not object to the transfer, and is willing to help the Public Security Bureau present evidence. Following the arrival of an officer from the Municipal Public Security Bureau requesting the transfer of the case, Liu Shi and Liu Enhong denied colluding with the criminals during questioning. Judge Qian approved Liu Enhong and Liu Shi, along with their twelve-year-old daughter, Xiulan, to be taken away by the officer from the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation. He also ordered the supplementary submission of official documents for review.</p>
<h3>Caojiadu Robbery Case Solved</h3>
<p>Robber Zhang Rijin gathered his gang the night before last, carrying weapons, and went to 3 Licheng Lane, Houmalu, Caojiadu, Huxi, to rob property. While they were ransacking the boxes and cabinets, the Sixth District Public Security Bureau learned of the situation and immediately sent police detectives to encircle and arrest them. Robber Zhang Rijin was arrested on the spot. He confessed the whereabouts of the remaining robbers and weapons. The police were dispatched to continue to arrest six accomplices, and a Browning pistol and eight bullets were found, all of which were taken to the district and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Old Baidu, Pudong</p>
<h3>Gangsters Openly Extort Good Citizens</h3>
<p>Zhang Chaoquan Almost Goes Insane. Zhang Chaoquan, a Jiangbei native who runs an oil cake shop attached to the Chunjiang Teahouse in the Sixteenth Pier, went to Old Baidu in Pudong to visit a friend the day before yesterday afternoon. He was carrying several silver coins and some fractional currency. As he was passing the five-bay section of the weaving factory on Gaoyou Road, five or six men resembling gangsters suddenly approached and dragged Zhang into the fifth bay, claiming that they were acting under the orders of the bureau chief and were checking for bandits. When they heard Zhang speaking with a Jiangbei accent, they immediately accused him of being a traitor and threatened him in every way. As a result, Zhang's silver coins and fractional currency ended up in the pockets of these gangsters. Zhang was so frightened that he rushed back to Puxi and almost went insane when he returned home. After a detailed investigation, it is said that the place has become an open extortion machine, and many people have been victimized. It is said that the ringleaders are Shen Ruizhi and Fang Xiaoruzi, Xiaoruxizi and other notorious gangsters. It is also reported that the police station has ordered a crackdown and punishment to ensure local peace.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Respected Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing in response to an article in your esteemed newspaper from the 4th of this month, which discussed a treatment for meningitis involving calcining alum (heating it until it turns red) and blowing it into the nostrils. My child happens to be suffering from epidemic meningitis (or some say tuberculous meningitis, which requires a pre-existing lung condition, but both epidemic and tuberculous meningitis are chronic). The onset included fever, chills, headache, vomiting (due to dizziness), and a slight rash (possibly due to sweat). Now, after more than twenty days, the teeth are clenched shut and cannot be pried open. Eating is difficult on the right side of the body, which is partially paralyzed. The whites of the eyes are slightly red, and the pupils are dilated.</p>
<p>There is frothing at the mouth, and the fever is low, which seems to confirm chronic meningitis. Several pharmacists have tried to calcine the alum, but it cannot be turned red, only a light yellow. Trying it has been ineffective. It seems that the calcination method is incorrect. I am writing specifically to earnestly request that you provide a small amount of the prepared medicine, or provide information on other treatment methods.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hu Shuming, April 7th</p>
<p>Reply from Physician Qu Shaowei:</p>
<p>Tuberculous meningitis and epidemic meningitis have different causes and symptoms and require detailed examination for accurate diagnosis. Generally, tuberculous meningitis is chronic, while epidemic meningitis is acute. Tuberculous meningitis does not necessarily occur after pulmonary tuberculosis. Currently, there is no good treatment method for it. If epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis can be treated early by an experienced doctor, there is still hope for recovery. The main treatment is to reduce intracranial pressure by injecting serum for this disease into the cerebrospinal fluid. Other treatments include applying ice packs to the head, maintaining cardiac function, shielding from light to darken the room, avoiding sounds, and keeping the patient quiet. Once symptoms such as clenched teeth, inability to speak, dilated pupils, and drooling are present, there is little hope of survival. The mention in the letter of calcining alum and blowing it into the nostrils is ignorant talk, and has no value in medical theory. Do not lightly believe it, as it may lead to fatal consequences.</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Welcoming Speech at the Banquet</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Tonight, Zhang Xueliang hosted a banquet for the League of Nations Investigating Commission at Huai Ren Tang. Zhang delivered an impromptu speech, stating: "Lord Lytton and distinguished members of the Investigating Commission, today I extend a most joyous and sincere welcome to you. I welcome you because you represent a world organization formed on the principles of international cooperation and justice. This organization has made great achievements in promoting peace and tranquility over the past twelve years. Our people, in the midst of this deep national crisis, are especially delighted by your arrival, knowing that friendly nations and the League of Nations will surely do their best to use peaceful means and open a path for China and Japan to restore fair and honorable relations in order to resolve the disputes between the two countries. The success of your mission is the restoration of peace in the Far East, which we all know is of great importance to world peace. The Chinese people, like the civilized countries of the world, deeply believe in the necessity of peace and the futility of war. There is no need to elaborate on this point. It is for this reason that we are deeply indignant at Japan's military aggression and arbitrary destruction in the Northeast provinces and coastal areas such as Shanghai. Since the September 18th Incident last year, China has consistently adhered to the policy of恪遵the obligations defined in the League of Nations Covenant. Unfortunately, Japan, disregarding the repeated resolutions of the League of Nations Council, has implemented a profound policy of military provocation and aggression against China. Motivated by the natural desire for international peace, goodwill, and national security, China has only sought to defend itself and has repeatedly warned Japan to pay attention to its obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League of Nations Covenant, as it is a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and a member of the League of Nations. I hope that my government's representatives and you will discuss the legal and political events surrounding the Sino-Japanese dispute. I do not wish to discuss them further here, but I would like to draw your attention to a few fundamental points for fair consideration: 1) The three eastern provinces are historically, politically, and economically an integral part of China. The residents of the Northeast are a large collection of diverse ethnic groups with a long history. They are all free citizens of the Republic of China. Economically, the Northeast is an indivisible part of China's national economy. Politically, it has played an important role in China's development for centuries. Therefore, today, the 450 million people of the country regard the Northeast as an important part of the motherland, just like Shandong, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and other provinces. The designation of Manchuria as a part of China outside its borders and the establishment of an illegal puppet government in the Northeast entirely by force is an attempt to conceal the ambition of territorial aggression and is aimed at violating the principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty signed in Washington in 1922. 2) Our country is now undergoing a major transformation. Foreign observers can see significant and real social, economic, and political changes everywhere. This change is a necessary consequence of restructuring to seek a new equilibrium. We believe that China's reform will be an important event of the 20th century. Just as the 19th century witnessed the rise of Germany, Italy, and Japan, the 20th century will witness the rise of China. However, during any major social and political reform, there must be some disturbances and disorders. Europe after the Industrial Revolution, France after 1789-1799, and the United States after independence and the Civil War all experienced tragic turmoil. These are all clearly documented. China today is a country in transition and cannot escape the historical laws experienced by Britain, France, and the United States, and cannot be expected to achieve a perfect political order overnight. Moreover, China has a vast territory, exceeding the combined area of the entire European continent and the Japanese Empire, so its task must be even more arduous. China's population, according to recent estimates, exceeds the total population of the entire European continent, and the Kuomintang movement aims to carry out political, social, industrial, and literary revolutions simultaneously. We hope that China's friendly nations and the powers can understand the greatness of this reform. We firmly believe that the vigorous spirit of work is a new driving force in the new world that can further consolidate world unity and world peace. Some Japanese politicians have openly stated that China is not a unified country, and others have stated that China is not a country of the new era. In our view, this kind of rhetoric contains political motives, hoping to conceal the true strength of China's management from the eyes of the world. 3) The real cause of this Sino-Japanese dispute lies in the progress of China's economy and society and the gradual achievement of political unification, rather than in the bad government or social stagnation in China. Japan has long harbored the ambition to divide and rule the three eastern provinces, which has been particularly evident since 1915. Japan has always used the development of railways in the three eastern provinces as a tool for its division and rule, and has tried its best to hinder our development of transportation and natural resources. Therefore, the railway issue is the primary cause of the Sino-Japanese dispute. It is said that Lord Lytton, the head of your commission, stated in a speech in Nanjing that China, as such a large country, inevitably encounters difficulties due to the lack of railways and other transportation methods. We in the three eastern provinces have long been aware of this point, so in the past thirty or thirty-five years, we have strived to expand transportation in order to connect the whole country, protect the borders, and lay the foundation for the economic well-being of the people.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the three eastern provinces have made great progress in social and economic construction. Many roads and railways have been built, many schools and cultural institutions have been opened, many factories have been established, and much wasteland has been reclaimed. In recent years, more than one million people have migrated from the Chinese mainland to the three eastern provinces every year. Although Japan has tried to control the economic undertakings of the Northeast, the economic and social development of the area is mostly the result of China's own efforts. Politically, although Japan has repeatedly warned the authorities of the Northeast provinces not to interfere in the politics of other parts of China, the participation of the Northeast in the development and unification of Chinese politics has been real and complete. Therefore, the progress of industry and culture, and the gradual achievement of political unification, especially my cooperation with the central government to manage and seek national unification, and the central government's emphasis on the politics of the Northeast and my appointment as Deputy Commander of the Chinese Army, Navy, and Air Force, aroused Japan's hatred, and eventually, it illegally occupied the three eastern provinces by force." Zhang Xueliang then asked the Investigating Commission to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute with clear insight and a spirit of justice, because only a fair resolution can maintain peace between the two countries. He also promised to assist the Investigating Commission in collecting information and to discuss all relevant issues sincerely. Finally, he raised his glass to toast the health of the members of the Investigating Commission and the success of their great mission. (Reuters Dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<h3>Original Text of the Manchukuo Foreign Ministry Telegram</h3>
<p>Causing a Bad Impression in All Circles of the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Beiping) The telegram sent by the Manchukuo puppet government to Foreign Minister Luo was returned by the telegraph bureau as undeliverable. The following is the original text of the telegram received from a certain source, to show the absurdity of its wording: "To His Excellency Luo Wengan, Foreign Minister of the Republic of China: Recent reports indicate that Your Excellency will send Mr. Gu Weijun, along with his entourage, to Manchuria with the members of the League of Nations Investigating Commission. Our Manchukuo is a new nation with lofty ideals, established by the public will of 30 million people to drive out warlords. We sincerely desire to establish friendly relations with Your Excellency's country. If any representatives or important officials come from afar, we will naturally welcome them with courtesy. Recently, Your Excellency's country has arbitrarily spread propaganda, denouncing our country as a puppet state and falsely accusing our officials of being traitors. As a result, our people's feelings towards Your Excellency's country are extremely激刺. If Mr. Gu's party enters our territory, it is difficult to guarantee that unscrupulous elements will not take various opportunities to hinder future goodwill between the two sides. We respectfully request that Your Excellency's Minister make proper arrangements to prevent Mr. Gu's party from coming, in order to avoid any accidents. We hereby decline your request, and request your kind consideration. Xie Jieshi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Manchukuo." (Special Dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Investigating Commission received a telegram from Nanjing today stating that the puppet state refused to allow Gu Weijun to go to the Northeast. The commission will send the original text to Geneva within the next few days. (Special Dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The League of Nations Investigating Commission is about to leave for the Northeast to conduct an on-site investigation in accordance with the League of Nations resolution. However, Xie Jieshi, the Foreign Minister of the Manchukuo puppet state, telegraphed Foreign Minister Luo on the 9th, refusing to allow the Chinese representatives to travel with them, claiming that the people there were激昂and that unscrupulous elements might take the opportunity to harm the Chinese representatives and other personnel, causing accidents. After receiving the news, Representative Gu contacted the Investigating Commission to discuss appropriate countermeasures. On the one hand, the Foreign Ministry made a thorough representation to the League of Nations. It is reported that the government believes that since there are unscrupulous elements in Manchuria who intend to cause trouble, the safety of the Investigating Commission and the accompanying representatives must be prearranged. It is planned to select elite guards to escort them to avoid accidents. (Special Dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The refusal of the Manchukuo puppet government to allow Dr. Gu Weijun to accompany the League of Nations Investigating Commission into Manchuria has caused an extremely bad impression in all circles of the League of Nations. It is generally felt that if this view is adhered to, it will create a serious situation. Lord Lytton has telegraphed the League of Nations Secretariat stating that if Dr. Gu cannot accompany him, he will not be willing to go to Manchuria. It is now expected that the Chinese delegation will request the Special Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly to convene a meeting. This matter will be brought before the Special Committee at the end of this week. If this is the case, the Special Committee may take a tough stance towards Manchuria. It is widely believed that Manchuria's attitude is actually instructed by Japan. (Reuters Dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A spokesperson for the League of Nations Investigating Commission told a foreign press reporter tonight that the report that the Manchukuo puppet government refused to allow Dr. Gu Weijun to enter Manchuria was slightly inaccurate. The Manchukuo puppet government's message to Nanjing only stated that it earnestly hoped that Your Excellency would find a way to prevent Dr. Gu Weijun from coming to Manchuria. The Investigating Commission did not consider this statement to be a refusal to allow Dr. Gu to enter Manchuria, but only regarded it as a kind of request, knowing in its heart that it could not be effective.

<p>The Jin army initially consisted of fourteen divisions, each with nine regiments. Later, Director Zhang stipulated a reduction to four regiments per division, with military pay issued at 80%. Monthly allocation was 1.6 million [currency unit]. Only the units of Fu Zuoyi, Wang Jingguo, Li Fuying, and Li Shengda were reduced to four regiments. The remaining units still had six or seven regiments, with each soldier receiving seven yuan in pay. Previously, Jin-Sui self-raised one million [currency unit], but Zhang provided monthly assistance of 300,000 [currency unit], leaving a significant shortfall. Li Fuying immediately urged payment of arrears. From March onwards, Jin-Sui military pay was to be issued by the Bing-Sui Office. After Yan assumed office, redundant agencies were cut and the existing army was reorganized, with each division reduced to six regiments. Currently, the Jin-Sui army consists of eight divisions and three independent brigades. The division commanders are Fu Zuoyi, Wang Jingguo, Li Fuying, Li Shengda, Yang Xiaoou, Yang Chengyuan, Yang Yaofang, and Sun Chu.

<h3>Hindenburg Re-elected German President</h3>
<p>Second Vote Results Exceed Hitler by Six Million Votes, National Socialist Party Still Maintains a Strong Political Party, Hopeful for the Prussian State Elections Reuters, Berlin, 11th: Hindenburg has been re-elected as German President, receiving six million more votes than National Socialist leader Hitler. Communist candidate Thaelmann received less than one-fifth of Hindenburg's votes. On the night of the 9th, conflicts repeatedly broke out between the Communists and the National Socialists, with one Communist killed and 200 people arrested by the police, but most were later released. Yesterday, the weather was overcast and the number of voters increased, as many abandoned their plans to travel to the countryside for leisure. Aside from armed police patrolling the streets and red flags hanging in worker areas, the city of Berlin presented a typical Sunday scene. The polling places closed at 6:00 PM, and the final official results of the election have not yet been announced, but by around 10:00 PM last night, it was known that Hindenburg had won an absolute majority. Unofficial data indicates the following results: Hindenburg 19,376,768 votes; Hitler 13,419,603 votes; Thaelmann 3,705,898 votes. Hindenburg's victory this time exceeded the expectations of his supporters, but Hitler's vote share of one-third of the total vote indicates that the National Socialist Party remains a strong political party. They are hopeful for the Prussian non-parliamentary elections on April 24.</p>
<p>Hindenburg, Re-elected German President</p>
<h3>Havas, Berlin, 10th</h3>
<p>Based on a partial announcement of the German presidential election results at 9:00 PM tonight, the impression is as follows, but with some reservations. Generally speaking, Hindenburg's vote count has slightly decreased compared to before, while Hitler's vote count has increased compared to March 13th. If this impression is confirmed, then the difference between the number of votes for the two this time should not be as</p>
<p>significant as before. Also, the voting results in East Prussia seem to be unfavorable to Hindenburg.</p>
<h3>Hindenburg Issues Declaration</h3>
<p>Pledges to Serve the Nation with a Non-Partisan Attitude, Hopes for National Unity to Avert Calamity Havas, Berlin, 11th: Hindenburg issued a declaration to the German people, stating, "I will keep my oath and fulfill my responsibility with an attitude that transcends all parties, a spirit of impartiality, and a firm and resolute will. I will restore Germany's freedom and equality in diplomacy, and seek national unity internally to revive the nation. Let you cease strife, for only sincere unity can save the fate of the country."</p>

<h3>Commentary from Various Newspapers</h3>
<p>National, Berlin, 11th: After President Hindenburg's re-election, the government's newspapers today celebrated the success, but at the same time, they were concerned about the fact that the National Socialist Party was able to increase its vote count by a huge margin and now has the support of 37% of the country's voters, making it the most powerful political party in Germany. However, the Berlin Daily, the organ of the Democratic Party, stated that the majority of voters elected Hindenburg this time to express their determination not to allow the government to lightly make changes and attempt to use the country as an experiment. This is the most significant lesson of this election. The Forward, the newspaper of the Socialist Party, stated that this election proves that the National Socialist Party cannot govern through legal means. It urged the government to do its best to prevent it from attempting to seize power through illegal means. The opposition newspapers stated that Hindenburg's election was only due to the people's admiration for his personality and had no important political significance. The conservative Morning Post stated that at least one-third of Hindenburg's votes came from members of the opposition party. At the same time, it also stated that Hitler's votes cannot be entirely attributed to members of the National Socialist Party, as many voters do not approve of the current system and therefore voted for Hitler to indirectly express that they do not want to change to a militaristic National Socialist state. The National Socialist Party's newspaper believes that gaining two million new voters in less than a month can be said to be a great victory for the party.</p>
<h3>The World's Eyes Focus on Geneva</h3>
<p>It Is Necessary to Prohibit Cruel War Implements, Let Us See the Results of the Disarmament Conference Reuters, London, 11th: In the coming weeks, the eyes of the world will again focus on Geneva, where politicians from all countries will gather to seek to dispel the insecurity concerns held by various countries. The most important issue is the Disarmament Conference. Generally speaking, it is believed that most countries are on the verge of bankruptcy, and even the two richest countries are suffering from not being able to use their money. Therefore, countries should be able to quickly reach an agreement to reduce national defense expenditures and promote trade. The initial stages of the Disarmament Conference have revealed the world's aversion to cruel war implements such as bombers, tanks, artillery, and poison gas. According to a report from Washington, if countries abolish submarines, the United States plans to propose the abolition of bombers. The countries that are most unwilling to give up submarines are France and Japan. During the recess, Chairman Henderson advised the delegates to submit detailed plans for prohibiting the most cruel war implements. When the conference resumes, all plans must be submitted to the General Committee for processing. Washington has prepared a table showing the percentage of budget items for repaying US debt and military spending in European countries. From these figures, it can be seen how the poor people of Europe are being abused by the demon of insecurity. The figures in the table are as follows:</p>
<p>Debt Repayment Percentage Military Spending Percentage</p>
<p>Italy 0.6 25.4 France 2.2 42.1 Britain 4.2 14.0 Belgium 2.0 110.3 Germany spends more on debt repayment than on military spending, with percentages of 22.04 for debt repayment and 11.6 for military spending.</p>
<h3>Japan's Rampant Violence Has Not Ceased</h3>
<p>Sufficient to Promote the US-Russian Alliance, Radek Warns in Writing</p>
<p>The Meeting of US-Russian Political Leaders Is Not Far Away, Former British Home Secretary Denounces the Incompetence of the League of Nations National, Moscow, 10th: Soviet Russian political and economic circles now believe that after US Secretary of State Stimson arrives in Geneva, he may meet with Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov, believing that the United States must recognize Soviet Russia as an important factor in resolving the Far Eastern situation. Even an informal meeting of the two politicians may produce important results. Prominent Communist leader Radek indirectly warned Japan today in an article published in the Communist Party's organ, Izvestia, that if it wants to attack Soviet Russia, it will force the Russians to ally with the United States. If the Soviet Union and Russia unite, Japan will inevitably suffer a great defeat. Radek claimed that if anyone provokes the Soviet Union, it will seek a temporary alliance with capitalist countries that do not harm its interests or invade its territory. The article hinted that the United States is naturally the country that the Soviet Union can rely on and assist in times of emergency, and emphasized that anti-Japanese sentiment is increasing in the United States, making an alliance with the Soviet Union possible. Finally, it stated that for the sake of self-preservation, Japan can only cooperate in friendship with Asian nations.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th: Former Home Secretary Clynes criticized the countries in a speech in Portsmouth today for condemning the dispute between China and Japan on the one hand, and supplying arms to the belligerent countries on the other. He said that if the League of Nations issued more straightforward statements to the aggressor countries than some politicians deemed necessary, it would be more beneficial. He hoped that in the future, the League of Nations would no longer express mildness towards those who commit atrocities when it has been clearly determined that atrocities have occurred.</p>

<h3>Japanese Extraordinary Cabinet Meeting Discusses Policy Towards Manchuria</h3>
<p>Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 11th: The government convened an extraordinary cabinet meeting this morning to deliberate on its policy towards Manchuria. Prime Minister Inukai and all cabinet members attended and discussed important issues carefully for five hours. First, the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Army Minister explained in detail the course of the construction of the Manchurian puppet state, diplomatic relations, industrial policy, railway issues, tariff issues, loan issues, and the defense relationship between Japan and Manchuria. The Finance Minister and other ministers asked questions about these items, and the relevant ministers answered them. Finally, the fundamental policy of Japan towards the Manchurian puppet state was decided, and the meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Issues of the Independence of the Three Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Conflicting Opinions Between Japanese Business and Military Circles, the Former Only Caring About Private Interests, the Latter Holding Other Aspirations Reuters, Tokyo, 7th: At the beginning of the Japanese army's launch in the Three Eastern Provinces, all circles in Japan unanimously supported the army. But today, the conflicting opinions between the business and military circles have become an open secret. The business circles that previously supported the military felt that there was no other way to make Zhang Xueliang and others respect Japan's rights in the Three Eastern Provinces other than to make them understand that Japan's patience had run out. Since Zhang could not automatically fulfill his obligations, the only option was to use force to make him realize his mistakes or replace him with someone who could fulfill his obligations. What the business circles demand is the protection of various rights based on treaties, and a peaceful and stable situation in which they can engage in industry and commerce under a reasonable guarantee of safety of life and property. This is what the business circles expect from the army and why they provide assistance. Although many people believe that the establishment of an autonomous government in the Three Eastern Provinces that expresses friendship with Japan is sufficient to meet their needs, they do not seem to support the idea of the Three Eastern Provinces declaring independence, as it may cause misunderstandings abroad. Even if the Japanese government has the sincerity not to be involved in the independence of the Eastern Provinces, it is undeniable that Japanese private citizens and military personnel are indeed significantly participating in the independence of the Eastern Provinces. The business circles believe that since this is the case, it is inevitable that foreign countries will misunderstand. This is the first difference between the business circles and the military circles. Capitalists want to seek concessions in the Eastern Provinces and develop their markets to promote the sale of domestic industrial products, while the military circles have other aspirations, wanting to use the Eastern Provinces as an outlet for Japan's surplus population. According to the military circles, it seems that the benefits gained through their sacrifices should be enjoyed by the Japanese people and should not be controlled by a small number of capitalists. This is the second difference between the business circles and the military circles. Whether Japanese immigration to the Eastern Provinces can be achieved in reality is highly doubtful, but the fact that the military circles are thinking from the perspective of the people benefiting and do not want to let the capitalists enrich themselves is also very relevant. The military circles certainly have shortcomings, but their concern for the people is something that capitalists and politicians cannot do. A faction of Japanese politicians and capitalists has always only cared about private interests, causing the party government to be gradually despised by the people, and the trend of opposing capitalism is now gradually spreading everywhere, which is not without reason. The military expresses sympathy for the common people in this matter, and the current shock-and-awe movement in Japan has a special meaning. The military circles oppose capitalists developing the Three Eastern Provinces, and oppose the appointment of positions such as the president of the South Manchuria Railway and the Governor-General of Kwantung as objects of party politics. All of this must be studied from the observation point of the Japanese shock-and-awe trend in order to see its truth.</p>
<h3>Pacific Cruise Group Arrives in Japan</h3>

<h3>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Discusses Japan's Diplomatic Situation</h3>
<p>Britain and France will not benefit from Japan's actions, only worried about the United States and the small countries in the League On the 6th, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun commented on Japan's diplomatic situation, saying that at present, the Far Eastern issues such as Manchuria and Shanghai, except that Shanghai has started ceasefire negotiations and the situation is relatively calm, the League is still stubbornly applying Article 15 of the Covenant, and has not changed its reserved attitude towards our side (Japan). Therefore, it is feared that the situation of convening a general meeting in May will not be optimistic. Therefore, we must pay attention to whether the future of the actual diplomacy of today's related countries will be beneficial to Japan. Because according to the report of the newly appointed Ambassador to France, Nagaoka, French Prime Minister Tardieu has stated that he will not be detrimental to Japan. Since France is the pillar of the League of Nations and respects the Treaty of Versailles with Germany, it must use strong measures. Therefore, France can understand our country's actions in China. The second is Britain. Since the election in October last year, the power of the Unionist Party has increased, and the three-party coalition cabinet has been shaken. The success of the Unionist Party in the future will be beneficial to our country. Although the small countries that occupy the majority in the League are currently strongly opposed to Japan, coupled with the anti-Japanese attitude expressed by British territories such as Canada and Australia, and the British Empire's diplomatic powers, the territories have the right to participate. Therefore, although the British mainland is pro-Japanese, it is feared that it will be greatly affected by the opposition of the territories. Among them, the visit of US Secretary of State Stimson to European countries in Geneva is particularly noteworthy. Although he is nominally dedicated to the Disarmament Conference and the Central European issues such as Germany, he is paying particular attention to the Far Eastern issues. Therefore, his visit to Europe will inevitably discuss the Sino-Japanese issue with strong countries such as Britain and France. It is difficult to predict how it will change. Therefore, our country's diplomacy at the above time is a major key to the country. For the theorists of the small countries who criticize "Japan did not entrust the Manchurian dispute case to peaceful means for resolution," our country should make a special statement, otherwise future disputes will be more difficult to resolve.</p>
<h3>Fluctuations in the Guangdong Financial World</h3>
<p>The Sudden Closure of Eight or Nine Large Banks Impacts Central Bank Notes, Leading to Discounts, Guangzhou Correspondence</p>
<p>The Guangdong financial world has recently experienced significant fluctuations. The reason for this is the Shanghai war's impact on the decline of commerce, the inflexibility of money markets, and the resulting suffering of banks. The first to close were Baohua Bank and Hede Bank in Guangzhou. These two banks were operated by a Mr. Yang and owed a total of one million yuan in foreign debt. All assets have been sealed by creditors to await sale and repayment. Other banks that had financial dealings with these two banks have also been affected. Recently, the Finance Department also implemented a crackdown on banks issuing receipts, further straining the capital of the banking industry. The public, having witnessed the sudden collapse of Baohua and Hede, became wary and rushed to withdraw their deposits from various banks. The banks were unable to meet these demands, leading to the continued collapse of Dalong, Mianxiang, Jinxiang, Houxiang, Juyi, Huixiang, and Dongxiang banks. These banks also owed over a million yuan in foreign debt. The banking industry immediately convened a meeting to discuss measures to maintain depositors' faith in banks, in order to prevent citizens from transferring their cash to foreign banks. They planned to publicly recommend that the municipal chamber of commerce step in to liquidate the closed banks, but before this proposal could be realized, a run on the provincial bank (formerly the Central Bank) occurred. As depositors withdrew their funds from the banks, the banks had no choice but to take their Central Bank notes, which they usually kept in reserve, to the provincial bank to redeem them for cash in order to repay depositors. As a result, starting from the first of this month, over a hundred people a day crowded outside the provincial bank to demand redemption. Cunning elements in the banking industry took the opportunity to manipulate discounts, so from the second day, one yuan of Central Bank notes on the market fell</p>
<p>to a discount of ninety percent. By the fourth day, the run on the provincial bank intensified, causing the value of Central Bank notes to fall further and further to eighty-eight percent. Although there were no official exchange rates on the market, shops raised prices on goods to avoid the stigma of accepting discounted Central Bank notes. Many in the market were reluctant to use Central Bank notes. The financial authorities have now announced that they are seeking ways to maintain the value of the currency. (April 5th)</p>

<p>Japanese Planes from Songjiang Reconnoiter the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</p>
<p>Since the ceasefire, it has been almost continuous. Every day, the planes pass over this county around 8 or 9 AM, as if on a schedule. At first, the people were quite alarmed, and those with some wealth and a timid disposition moved to Shanghai, seeking refuge in the concessions. However, over time, they became accustomed to it and were no longer surprised. However, in the past three days, the time the planes pass over Songjiang seems to have moved earlier. Yesterday (the 9th), the sound of their engines was heard as early as 6 AM. They flew very low, almost as if they were only a few yards above the rooftops, making it possible to see the plane's number.</p>

<h3>Biographies of Sixty Nameless Martyrs</h3>
<p>— Qu Chang</p>
<p>Alas! Since the outbreak of war at sea, many soldiers have died. None, however, have been as courageous as the sixty men who died in the Battle of Wenzaobang. These sixty men belonged to the 19th Army, mostly from Guangdong. Their names cannot be known in detail. In February of this year, the Japanese, having suffered repeated defeats, were not to be outdone. On the 13th, they drove more than 5,000 men, swearing to die, to attack our fortified positions in Wenzaobang. Their force was like a mountain collapsing and the sea overturning, their shouts shaking the heavens and the earth. Within several miles, flesh and blood flew in all directions. Our army fought bitterly, reaching a critical point between Shen and Wei. The sixty men were greatly angered and requested permission to die. Each wrapped large explosive charges around their chests, backs, and limbs, and soaked their clothes in kerosene. They divided into groups and sneaked into the enemy ranks. They suddenly fell to the ground, striking their palms. The explosives detonated simultaneously. Their bones and flesh were pulverized, and the enemy, caught by surprise, was also pulverized. From near and far, the explosions corresponded. In the chaos, the enemy thought a large army was attacking and collapsed. Our army took the opportunity to pursue and defeat them, stopping only after more than ten miles. The water in the river stopped flowing. More than ten days later, forty men used this same method to break the enemy army of several thousand at Jiangwan.</p>
<p>Wang Quchang said: "The ancients had a saying, 'To kill one enemy and die is enough to compensate; to die without regret. To kill two enemies and die is to make a contribution to the country.'" How much more is this true of these martyrs? I know that although these martyrs have died, their will is ever more joyful and without regret. The only thing to lament is that those who die without compensation are to be lamented. Those who die without compensation are like cattle and horses. Yet the world only seeks the death of cattle and horses, not knowing how to kill the enemy to compensate themselves. Alas!</p>
<h3>Not as Good as a Dog</h3>
<p>— Yingge</p>
<p>Zhang Jian of Nantong once said "Not as good as a dog," and there was a reason for this statement.</p>
<p>A comprador of a certain foreign firm, originally from Rugao, once took his beloved dog from Shanghai back to his home in Rugao to visit his family. At that time, his wife, because her husband had not returned for many years, had taken up with a local man. They lived a sweet life, and their love was rising to a fever pitch. Of course, the wife's husband returning home would inevitably ruin their dreams and consign them to a sad and lonely fate. So the two of them hardened their hearts and murdered the wife's husband, burying the body in the nearby ground. But the dead man's dog was still alive, and it cried at the police station day after day. Even when it was beaten, it would not leave. So the police were very curious and followed it a few steps. This dog had received advanced training. Seeing someone following it, it led the way straight to the place where the corpse was buried. It used its paws to dig up the dirt and finally unearthed the corpse. Only then was the murder case solved. Zhang Jian, knowing the dog's righteous act, immediately invited it to sit in a green sedan chair and wrote extensively about it, saying "Not as good as a dog." He also presented it with a plaque that read, "Ashamed to be less than you." This is, of course, an old story. But what about today's traitors compared to this dog?</p>
<h3>Drops</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Let me ask, with foreign aggression so severe, and the nation on the verge of destruction, how can anyone with a conscience still harbor selfish intentions, pull troops, expand their own power, and compete for personal status? Mr. Feng Yuxiang's few enlightened words exposed the hypocritical motives of past and present warlords. Among the active soldiers, it is still barely satisfactory. If the nation's military leaders sincerely love the country and protect the people, they should deeply reflect on these words and immediately show a sincere heart of "unity and cooperation to overcome national difficulties"!</p>
<p>It is better to take action than to talk about it! I hope that the troops that have been training for decades will go to the front line to kill the enemy! If they remain at the top of Mount Tai, singing high-pitched songs, it will be of no avail. Even if they are really sick, they should overcome all difficulties and work diligently for the public. Know that the national crisis is as urgent as fire burning eyebrows. This is not a time for soldiers to take leisurely tours. ) (</p>
<h3>The Romance of the Military Double Building (32)</h3>
<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Four: Forced Marriage Approaches, Restless Self-Disturbance, Enemy Air Raids, War Begins Anew</p>
<p>In normal times, this kind of thing would be entirely managed by my late father, and I wouldn't need to ask about it. But because of this major incident, the family fortune has been lost. The source of funds for my expenses outside has been cut off. Only then did I remember that my late father had mentioned that the business managed by Uncle Da Kui, more than half of the capital was ours. Plus, I'm short of cash these days, so I wrote to him asking him to remit money. Unexpectedly, he used this as an excuse to default on the debt, fundamentally trying to swallow my only remaining property. In fact, regardless of the partnership relationship, just speaking of the affection between uncle and nephew, seeing me in such misfortune, it wouldn't hurt him to generously give me some assistance. Moreover, this expense has always been allocated by him. Once he bites down and refuses to admit it, he may not be able to justify it reasonably. Sure enough, he anticipated my move and instead said in the letter that I had already misappropriated a lot of money from him in the past, and now that repayment is hopeless, it's difficult to lend any more. He simply asked me to seek an independent life in the future and stop relying on him, this uncle. Having taken advantage of me, he still has to give me a lecture. I am truly wronged. After saying this, tears welled up in my eyes, and I couldn't help but cry silently. Wei Zhuomou took the letter, opened it, and read it carefully, while listening to An Yutian tell him with such grief and indignation. He couldn't help but suppress his humorous nature, put the letter down, and sighed, "Your cousin is really not a person. You don't know that the big trouble in your family this time was actually caused by him, completely harmed by him. Otherwise, Niu Heifeng, although he is a completely evil gang leader, has no grievances or enmity with your family. Why would he take such a poisonous hand for no reason? I didn't know the inside story before. Only this morning did I receive a letter from home, written by Mei Cun's Mei Zike. He is also the uncle of your cousin Yuyuan. Fortunately, Yuyuan was unharmed afterwards. ." However, he was afraid that the rumors would be inaccurate, and it would only hurt your uncle and nephew's feelings. When An Yutian heard this, he quickly asked, "Now you understand that I have no affection with him at all. If there is anything special, please tell me quickly." To know what Wei Zhuomou said, there will be a resolution in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The Lowest Price in Ten Years for Foreign Coin</p>
<h3>Seven Qian Zero Five Li Two Hao Ban</h3>

The noon market actually continued to fall by one li, to seven qian zero five li two hao ban. The difference between the fall in the two markets was a total of one li seven hao ban. The weakness of people's hearts can be imagined, and if this continues, what will become of the future of the Shanghai coin market?

Copper coins were increased by 1,500 wen to 412,500 wen.</p>
<h3>A Comprehensive Look at the Inside Story of the Coin Drop</h3>
<p>A Key Reason is the Shrinking Commercial Scope and the Suspension of Tea and Fan Loans. The Required Use of Silver Has Greatly Decreased, and Sources from the Yangtze River Have Flooded In</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, the Shanghai coin has tended to shrink, and although the decline has not been rapid, the figures for each day's downward trend are truly alarming. Judging from these two weeks, the difference has reached more than one cent. The outside world only knows that there are many sources, but there are actually hidden reasons that the outside world does not know. What are these hidden reasons? The following is the situation.</p>
<p>Because the drop in coin prices has a great impact on the Shanghai market, the reporter made various interviews to obtain the underlying truth. The biggest reason is the shrinking commercial scope of Shanghai. Previously, although the concessions were the commercial center, the areas adjacent to Zhabei and the South Market, as well as the small towns and cities of Nanxiang, Songjiang, and Zhenru, etc., used a large amount of spot silver for commercial operations. Recently, due to the war in these places, they have all concentrated in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Currently, the tea season has begun, and foreigners use a very large amount of money. Financial institutions have a large amount of reserves prepared for this time to launch and irrigate, but now, due to the situation, loans have been suspended. Therefore, this kind of tea trade that uses foreign money will naturally lose the opportunity and dare not take risks rashly, leaving the money stored for a long time without being released.</p>
<p>The banks, since the war, have been unwilling to supply banknotes as much as possible, so circulation has decreased, and the demand for goods is not high. The buying and selling in the market still belongs to the increase or decrease of cash. This is also a reason. The sources from various ports and the Yangtze River basin had already been clarified by the outside world, but although the outflow has not been completely cut off, the exports are not many. In summary, it is appropriate that the price is declining.</p>
<h3>Yarn Mills Are Extremely Accommodating to Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>With Accumulated Inventory and Sluggish Sales, the Future is Pessimistic. The spot market for cotton yarn is extremely pessimistic. Due to the confusing situation and abnormal anxiety, the financial situation is extremely tight. The various gangs have no excitement, and the actual demand is very calm. The selling price is falling more and more fiercely, with a trend of decline. The reason is that the mills are gradually recovering their work, and the number of output is expected to increase. This spring sales season has been completely affected by the war, and the economic situation in the interior is becoming more and more difficult, so most of the 20-count yarn is shipped directly to Shanghai, which shows the dimness of the market. The accumulated inventory in Shanghai is gradually thickening. According to actual observations, the future of the current yarn is still at risk of falling, so the mills are extremely willing to accommodate sales. According to the statistics of the various gangs that bought yesterday, the market fell by five cents and one tael. The guest gangs entered 180 bales from Qinhuangdao, 40 bales from Guangdong, 32 bales from Shantou, 14 bales from the interior, 10 bales from Hankou, 5 bales from Ningbo, and 105 bales from the same industry. Shenxin Factory opened 180 bales of 16-count Ren Zhong yarn, priced at 165 taels and 5 qian to 2 qian and a half.</p>
<h3>Shenxin Continues to Procure Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable, but the trend is still softening. Because the foreign cotton situation is weak, it is still difficult to boost people's confidence, and the yarn sales are sluggish. The mills are very lax in their procurement of raw materials, so there are few actual transactions. However, the various sources are still depleted, so the selling price can still be maintained. It is heard that Shenxin Factory has a large amount of imports. Today, it purchased 500 bales of Indian cotton. The following is a record of the sales:</p>
<p>Xingheng Flower 32.50 Shenxin Factory entered 500 bales, which will be shipped to the factory.</p>
<h3>Weekly Report on Indian and British Cotton Industry</h3>
<p>Last week, Bombay's market prices followed the weakness of American cotton. Only 2,200 bales were delivered for the April-May term. However, bullish sentiment in the market was also disappointed due to unfavorable overseas news, leading to widespread liquidations. Currently, the price drop here is more severe than in Liverpool, resulting in a wider price gap between Bombay and Liverpool. There is a need for hope of export revival. Exporters are purchasing Bai Luo Xi Southern cotton in the mainland due to the decline in market prices. Cotton farmers are hoarding, but soon new arrivals will flood the market. Kangtai experienced rain, causing slight damage, but most cotton has already been harvested. The statistics for the past week are appended below (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>|                       | 1931 | 1932 |</p>
<p>|-----------------------|------|------|</p>
<p>| Cumulative receipts since September 1 | 2513 | 1249 |</p>
<p>| Inventory at the end of the week | 963  | 648  |</p>
<p>| Cumulative exports since September 1 | 1709 | 658  |</p>
<p>| To Europe              | 435  | 97   |</p>
<p>| To China              | 235  | 158  |</p>
<p>| To Japan              | 1024 | 377  |</p>
<p>| Other regions          | 152  | 6    |</p>
<p>Liverpool's spot market last week was quiet. Regarding futures, speculators were wary due to silver prices. The reduction in American cotton fields was less than generally predicted, causing public selling. However, due to excessive selling at the end of the week, prices rebounded due to short covering. Simultaneously, Japan and Bombay also made purchases. Egyptian cotton fluctuated along with American cotton, but most transactions were speculative.</p>
<h3>Increase in US Cotton Imports by China and Japan</h3>
<p>Following Japan's re-imposition of the gold export ban, an increase in US cotton imports is predicted. As a result, continued purchases will gradually deplete existing cotton stocks. It is found that since August 1st of last year, Japan has purchased 1,569,902 bales of cotton, compared to 716,304 bales during the same period last year, an increase of 853,598 bales, exceeding half the amount. The increase rate of US cotton purchased by China is even greater than that of Japan. Purchases made before February 27th totaled 883,769 bales, compared to 246,676 bales during the same period last year, an increase of 637,093 bales, reaching more than three times the amount.</p>
<h3>Food: Shanghai Rice Market Affected by Rain</h3>
<p>Yesterday in Shanghai South, there was continuous rain. Early in the morning, sources from West Road No. 34 reported that Tongfeng and Tai Hongsheng opened trade with both thin indica and northern japonica rice at 20 cents each. Particularly special goods were offered in the grey market at 15.5 yuan. Due to the continuous drizzle yesterday, the entire city suspended rice measuring for the day. However, goods already open for trade can be measured tomorrow if the weather clears up. It is also reported that rice measuring in the North City was also suspended due to the rain.</p>
<h3>Large Military Demand for Foreign Rice Depleted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market along the Changjiang Gang (Yangtze River shipping guild) was very smooth. The market unexpectedly saw a surge in activity due to a large military demand depletion. Customers from various routes along the Changjiang Gang, such as Hankou, Nanjing, and Chongming, as well as inland villages in the vicinity of the street, also contributed to the depletion. Consequently, the market became extremely active and prices are expected to improve. The total market transaction amounted to over 9,000 bags of Xiao Jiao rice, priced at 9.65 yuan to 9.52 yuan, and then at 9.38 yuan. 300 bags of Min Dang rice were traded at 9.85 yuan. 200 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice were traded at 10.09 yuan. There were no new futures transactions. The total market only saw the return of 300 tons of goods at a price of 4.63 taels for April delivery.</p>
<h3>Spot Flour and Foreign Wheat Show Conflicting Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign wheat prices rose by 6 or 7 jiao, while the flour market showed weakness. Because a large number of bulls unwound their positions at the end of last week, market sentiment was wary of further gains and foreign wheat had arrived at port. This caused both spot and futures flour prices to decline by more than one fen in the morning. Subsequently, the market rebounded due to strong real demand from the Northern shipping guild, and reports indicated that the Soviet Union had ordered a large batch of spot flour in railway cars, and that factories had limited flour inventories and were unwilling to release them. This improved market sentiment. Spot flour from the "Green Soldiers Ship" reached 2.07 taels, and May futures remained at 2.0825 taels.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Trading Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw little activity with slight transactions of Taikoo sugar. No telegrams from producing areas arrived at the guild. The market assessment remained quiet. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white was quoted at 13.1 taels with no movement. Finely ground granulated white sugar was quoted at 13.15 taels with scarce transactions. This was likely due to recent sluggish sales everywhere, gradually stabilizing the market. However, market sentiment remained firm. Trading at Taikoo Sugar Refinery saw slight activity. B mark was traded at 16.2 taels, DY mark at 15.5 taels, HM mark at 13.6 taels, and HX mark at 14.6 taels. Demand remained strong and the trend was quite good. Quotations and other market segments remained extremely quiet.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Water-Resistant US Raincloth Breaks the 4-Tael Barrier</h3>
<p>Single-sided water-resistant US rainwear cloth, which had been enjoying brisk sales, has now seen a decline in market sales due to the current situation and tight monetary conditions, causing the market to continuously decline. The highest price for this type of water-resistant US rainwear cloth last year was 4.75 taels, and the lowest was 4.4 taels. The opening price this spring was also 4.4 taels. Rongtai, Deji, Hongsheng, Haohua, Ningfeng, Taihe, and Zhengchang all initially maintained the same price, later reducing it to 4.25 taels, but there were still no inquiries. Last week, it fell an additional 1 jiao. Yesterday, it fell again, breaking the 4-tael barrier. Most merchants were quoting 3.95 taels. Due to the rain, there were slight transactions, totaling just over ten cartons. However, the actual selling price was only 3.875 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: All Wuxi Silk Stockpiles Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the National Army retreated to Kunshan, Japanese planes have frequently flown over the Suzhou-Wuxi area, causing public panic. Merchants are also reluctant to stockpile goods. Wuxi is a famous silk-producing region in our country. Although the silk mills have all ceased operations, the silk stored in the warehouses is worth a considerable amount. In addition to most of it having already been scheduled for shipment to Shanghai, in recent days, another 300-plus packages of white filature silk have been transported by truck to Zhenjiang and transferred to Yangtze River steamers for shipment to Shanghai. It is expected that the silk stockpiles in Wuxi warehouses will be cleared soon.</p>
<h3>European and American Silk Telegrams Remain Unclear for Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market remained sluggish. Telegrams from European and American firms sent to overseas destinations last week regarding white filature silk had not yet been relayed to Shanghai as of yesterday morning. Both Chinese and foreign parties were observing and refraining from action. Yesterday, only Shen Yu imported 15 packages of yellow filature silk and Zhonghe imported 20 packages of white dried silk. Prices remained stable.</p>
<h3>Metals: British Steel Plates Show Gradual Easing</h3>
<p>Although recent transactions in British steel plates have shown activity, excessive arrivals and negative market sentiment have caused prices to decline. Currently, 2.5-li steel plates are selling for 8.75 taels per dan (unit of weight), 6.375-li for 6.2 taels, and 1.5-fen steel plates for 5.5 taels. Steel plates of half a fen or more are only selling for 5.25 taels. It is found that recent transactions have been most active for 0.75-fen steel plates. The main buyers are from Qingdao and Tianjin, with some activity also in the Yangtze River region.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Talks</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan and Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I saw Zhou Jun Shoujuan smashing a statue of Ma Zhanshan, which reminded me of something I saw.</p>
<p>My room is rented in the French Concession. Every morning, I take the Route 17 trolleybus to the office and return in the evening. This is my regular working life, rain or shine. One day, the trolleybus was passing near the Great World when I suddenly noticed a large advertisement on a whitewashed wall. The advertisement featured a general around 50 years old, standing with a horizontal saber, full of heroic spirit and an aura of invincibility. Above the image were the words "Ma Zhanshan Cigarettes."</p>
<p>At that time, Ma Zhanshan was fighting fiercely against the Japanese in Nenjiang and Angangxi, displaying great courage and determination. Patriotic people at home and abroad were donating money and sending telegrams of support. The cigarette company, admiring Ma Zhanshan's great name, also launched a "Ma Zhanshan" brand of cigarettes in response to the situation. I heard that these cigarettes were very popular at the time, truly achieving both fame and profit.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this large cigarette advertisement has recently disappeared. The wall is once again whitewashed, and in the middle of the white paint, a faint image of Ma Zhanshan remains, as if displaying a pitiful expression of shame towards the people of the country. I think the reason the company cancelled the cigarettes is the same as Zhou Jun smashing the statue of Ma Zhanshan: a feeling of anger. Therefore, Ma Zhanshan's misfortune also brought misfortune to the cigarettes.</p>
<p>Recalling this incident, I have a feeling. It is the same person, the same Ma Zhanshan, and the time difference is less than three months. Why was the Ma Zhanshan of the past worshipped, made into statues, and commemorated with cigarettes? In what short amount of time were his statues smashed, his cigarettes discontinued, and he was deeply hated and cursed? As the ancients said, it is better to leave a bad name for ten thousand years than to achieve eternal glory. However, Ma Zhanshan, within two or three months, completed both "achieving eternal glory" and "leaving a bad name for ten thousand years," which is truly a strange tale.</p>
<p>Since Ma Zhanshan had the potential for eternal glory, why did he abandon it and instead commit such acts that would leave a bad name for ten thousand years? Everyone feels sorry for Ma Zhanshan. Some say that Ma Zhanshan was originally a bandit hero, and the concepts of eternal glory and disgrace are irrelevant to him. His resistance against the Japanese was merely a temporary outburst of righteousness. The world's worship of Ma Zhanshan was originally a deception. This argument is insightful. If he truly understood righteousness, he would not have betrayed so quickly.</p>
<p>However, my view is different. Although Ma Zhanshan was a bandit hero, his righteousness, although not permanent, was able to be aroused temporarily. After all, Ma Zhanshan still had some righteousness to be commended, and there was still a moment when it could be aroused. Looking north, I see those who hold military power and advocate a policy of non-resistance, their blood has completely cooled, and there is no moment, nor any method, to arouse them. Compared to Ma Zhanshan, what are they like?</p>

<p>Popular Science</p>
<h3>Invention of Meat Made from Wood by the Common People</h3>
<p>Meat made from wood—when I say this, everyone thinks it's either a myth or bragging. Actually, it's neither. This is a genuine and factual scientific development. If you don't believe me, listen to my explanation.</p>
<p>During the European War, Germany was restricted by the Allied blockade. Previously, they relied on foreign countries for raw materials, especially food supplies. This suddenly became scarce. As a result, scientists in the country frantically rushed to invent homemade raw materials to meet essential needs. For example, lacking rubber to manufacture tires, chemists extracted a substance similar to rubber from an unsaturated hydrocarbon called Isopren to replace it. Glycerin was used not only to manufacture explosives but also extracted from starch through bacterial action to supplement supplies. However, when it came to the three major essential elements of nutrients: starch, fats, and proteins, scientists spent countless efforts trying to find alternative sources for these three substances. In the end, because this problem could not be solved, the country suffered a food shortage and lost the war.</p>
<p>At that time, in 1916, Bergius of Heidelberg was also one of those studying this problem. After 14 years of painstaking thought and experimentation, he finally solved this problem in 1930, resulting in the world-famous "Bergius's Invention of Meat Made from Wood."</p>
<p>The method uses inexpensive wood or wood shavings, soaked in concentrated hydrochloric acid. After a certain period, the fibrous material contained in the wood is completely converted into sugar. Then, the hydrochloric acid is extracted in its original quantity using vacuum distillation, ready for secondary use. Next, the sugar and a small amount of acetic acid are analyzed. Finally, the remaining substance, Lignin, which accounts for one-third of the total quantity, can be used as fuel.</p>
<p>The sugar produced in this way is extremely cheap. When used to feed pigs, they can grow fat and large in a shorter period. Once the pigs are slaughtered, the problems of fats and proteins can be solved simultaneously.</p>
<p>This invention of making meat from wood was once tested by the Prussian government, and the results were very good. As a result, Steiger, the Prussian Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, submitted it to the parliament for discussion. Unfortunately, in this world of economic panic where no solution can be found, if Bergius's method of making meat from wood were implemented, the bankruptcy of farmers would increase unimaginably, potentially leading to farmer uprisings. Therefore, it was not adopted by the authorities. The Soviet Union bought the patent for making meat from wood with huge funds.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1931, Bergius went to the Soviet Union to supervise the construction of factories. It is expected that in the near future, frozen meat and lard from the United States will no longer monopolize the world's markets. Professor Bergius received the Nobel Prize in 1931 for his invention of extracting petroleum from coal and making meat from wood.</p>
<p>Casual Talks</p>
<h3>The Death of a Wounded Soldier by Wu</h3>
<p>This morning, my siblings and I used all our savings to buy some biscuits and socks to visit our loyal and brave soldiers who fought and sacrificed for the country. This kind of work fills us with infinite joy because it allows us to contribute our sincere "love" to the most conscious and brave soldiers of our nation.</p>
<p>In a corner of the Red Cross, which used to be an outpatient clinic, has now been turned into a sickroom for our wounded soldiers. Because there were not enough beds in the hospital, our wounded brothers had to lie on the floor. We were all saddened by this tragic scene, especially my little brother who simply cried out. We offered them all our gifts in shame, but their ardent gratitude almost made me cry.</p>
<p>Parts of their bodies were wrapped in white bandages, stained with splashes of blood. Some were groaning in pain, while others were excitedly telling their companions about their experiences of killing the enemy. Suddenly, a terrible cry arose from the darkest part of the room, almost unbearable to hear, so I crawled to find the sound. I met his eyes, which swept over me sadly. I stroked him, I pitied him, I wanted to use my mouth to suck out all his pain, I gnashed my teeth hating the cruelty that Japanese imperialism inflicted on us. Soon a young nurse brought a bag of ice and kindly applied it to his pain. But this could not calm him down. He still screamed hoarsely, so my lovely sister lay down and stroked his face with her little hands, forcing a bitter smile at him without a word. After a long time, she finally uttered a sob of tears.</p>
<p>"You are injured, you...cannot...cry out!..."</p>
<p>Then the severely wounded warrior slowly reached out and held my sister's hands tightly for a long time. He shook his head and said sadly...</p>
<p>"Ah, I also have a lovely...little...sister like you at home!" Two large tears flowed down at the same time. Then I said... (To be continued)</p>
<p>From All Directions</p>
<h3>A Dime, Little Girl</h3>
<p>I had been thinking about it for a long time, wanting to go to Longhua to see the peach blossoms, and today I finally got my wish.</p>
<p>Although I am not a scholar from the Qing Dynasty, I am still afraid of soldiers. Before, when I mentioned Longhua, I did not know what influence had brought to me, it was quite scary... Now I regard it as the fairyland of "peach blossoms on both banks". Anyway, it's all imagination, and you can only know when you see it.</p>
<p>After walking many roads in dust and smoke, I finally arrived at Longhua. By that time, it was already getting late, and my heart was beating very badly, and I couldn't wait to swallow the scenery in my eyes in one breath. At first, I decided to go to the main hall of Longhua Temple.</p>
<p>I've seen enough temples, and there's nothing rare. There are many modern young ladies worshiping in front of the Buddha, just like the little old ladies with bound feet who are "Babatou".</p>
<p>In the garden next to the temple, there was filming of a movie. A martial arts star was trying very hard to pick up another actress. When he couldn't lift the person being picked up, the camera stopped recording.</p>
<p>People swarmed to watch the filming. The edges of ditches and the trees, no matter what, they could not be prohibited from making noise, following the movements of "killing and slashing" and roaring randomly.</p>
<p>I went through the temple in a circle, and except for the two withered peach trees in front of the hall, everything was not what I had guessed.</p>
<p>I ran to the tower across the street with great interest. Someone was blocking there, and there was also an armed policeman next to him. He said in an inquiring way, "A dime."</p>
<p>We retreated to the center of the street and looked up at the tower, as if the person on the tower was using "a dime" to show pride to us.</p>
<p>I still didn't see the peach blossoms. I asked someone, and they told me that there was a Five-Colored Peach Blossom Garden nearby. When I ran over, the ticket seller stretched out his hand, "A dime!"</p>
<p>I returned disappointed, and the peach blossoms bought back by people had some petals scattered on the ground. I don't know if it's rouge powder falling from a beauty's face... I don't know if it's crimson bloodstains, and I don't know what illusions are there.</p>
<p>The wind seemed to be sending sounds, and in my ears, "A dime" "A dime" was echoing.</p>
