<h3 id="c28">今後日本帝國主義對華之行動乃 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>中蘇復交聲中𤍠河形勢忽告緊張日本帝國主義今後對華之侵略究將採取如何之步武乎</p>
<p>以言大勢則國際間一切之演變均不外經濟關係之策動吾人旣一再言之矣往昔東省當局之失策即爲一面在經濟上對滿鐵及大連港口作强烈之競爭而一面於軍事上不作適當之設防九一八事變旣起猶認爲偶然之變端而不知其爲經濟鬭爭必然之結果委地撤兵三省盡失往事不忘後事之師吾人欲推測今後日本帝國主義之行動其必仍以經濟關係爲基點蓋無疑也</p>
<p>日本帝國主義因工業資本發展生産膨脹之結果關於原料之獲得及過剩商品之銷售原有殖民地漸不足以供其刮削之需不得不進圖略取東三省爲其新殖民地殖民地略取之通常步驟始之以甘言利誘使愚昧之領袖與之訂立種種條約以囊括該地之主要經濟利益迨甘言利誘之不足而所詐取之經濟利益無由得充分之發展與保障則不得不終之以武力之爭奪世界恐慌以還國際間關稅鹽疊權長增高生産過剩之病態日積日甚此先天不足之日本失業銳增現金銳減國民經濟及國家財政同　捉襟見肘之窘態對於東三省之呑併本已成爲計無所出刻不容緩之要圖而當時東省當局對於鐵道建設與葫蘆島築淃工作之猛進復與日人以重大之威嚇卒以促成九一八之事變吾人對於過去之不幸雅不欲重加論列其不惜一再申說者不過欲使國人勿貿然再以單純對日經濟抗爭爲已足而須知經濟之抗爭必更須以武力爲後盾也</p>
<p>經濟之鬭爭必招武力之掠奪更可於滬變徵之九一八事變以後抵貨風潮以長江流域爲最烈上海爲長江門户因地理之關係遂成抵貨運動之中心惟其爲抵貨運動之中心乃終有一二八之事變「對滬之用兵在掃蕩長江抵貨之高潮」此固日人之所公然昭告於世界者</p>
<p>由已往以察將來則日人今後對華行動之緩急必須視其國内經濟狀况之進退爲轉移吾人而有武力抗日之决心與準備也則經濟上之鬭爭自爲必然應有之手段倘吾人而無武力抗日之决心與準備也則無寗簟食壷漿迎敵人於千里之外奴顔婢膝以事此東亞大陸之新主人如猶徒侈談經濟抵抗日以敵人經濟社會之動摇自鳴得意則須知日本帝國主義整個顚覆之前夜必猶傾巢向中國作猛烈之進攻背城借一以試其最後之掙扎吾人志滿意得之日恐即爲大難臨頭之時</p>
<p>由歷史路線以觀察帝國主義覆亡已不在遠日本自難例外日人對滿之用兵旣爲日暮途窮迫不獲已之舉臨渴掘井其不足以救其現制度之危亡已昭然若揭則自今以後國内之危機日迫對我國之侵略自必日益加緊東三省之經營旣非咄嗟間所能收效而義軍之活動已先使國外之農産銳减經濟混亂其必遷怒他方對𤍠河平津作軍事之行動殆爲意中之事以中國民族之碩大中日民族間歷史關係之惡劣國人一息尙存决不能受任何人之率領以乞降於敵人之前則今後中日間之鬭爭其將日趨擴大日趨激烈殆爲理有固然勞所必至</p>
<p>吾人於此有須鄭重爲國人告者則日本帝國主義對華侵略之加緊旣爲其國内資本主義發達必然之結果而並非出於一二政客軍閥之野心倘猶欲望其覺悟冀其退讓則貽誤於旣往者將更貽戚於將來吾人唯一之出路厥唯準備犧牲積極奮鬭而决非任何和平之述夢</p>

<p>我國首席代表顔惠慶博士、於行政院開會之先一日、特在代表處招待各國新聞記者、說明中國對於聯盟之希望、並謂「軍國主義爲吾人所反對、但至不得已時、中國或亦被迫援用、」各報對於此語多表而出之、蓋自十九路軍在上海抵抗日本後、歐人已不敢輕視中國人也、演詞大意爲中國政府並無推翻李頓調查團報告書中事實之指陳之意、中國政府對報告書中所述各點、容有未能完全同意者、然調查團之委員、皆屬一時人望、且經雙方同意、調查之性質、純爲中立無偏、故調查團調查所得、尤其當眞理極爲顯明之時、若從而向其挑戰、自　　　、中國代表來此、亦非爲宣告中國政府已採取並堅持直接違反調查團之建議及勸告之政策、而不顧國聯及條約義務之約束、吾人來此、亦非爲贊揚黷武主義、中國赤手空拳抵抗日本之侵略、已一年有餘、刻已準備再接再厲、堅持到底、必要時、爲求解脫計、即迫而運用一切黷武工的方法、亦所不惜、然中國政府固深痛黷武主義、厭惡戰爭、而渴求和平者也、中國代表之來日内瓦、乃在請求聯盟予吾人以和平及正義、過去十四個月中、中國雖感受極端痛苦、仍始終不失信於國聯、而日本之侵略行爲、則日甚一日、其不宣之戰、且對軍縮會議及歐洲和平前途、横加不少阻力、吾人從知控制日本之軍閥之所渴望者、並非和平、而爲戰爭、渠等對國聯之行動、不視爲一種公平之解决方法、而視爲遷延時日、並獲得一種負面的國際不干涉的保證之機會、同時對於一年前開始之不宣而戰之侵略計畫、則仍猛進不怠、中國政府對於國際聯合會之善意及効忠、其能帮助補救此項悲劇者、過去已然將來亦然、吾人深信吾人旣能對國聯守信義、則届時國聯各會員國亦必能對中國守信義、諸君對於國聯盟約各條所規定之義務、舉凡已由中國政府提請援用·或尙未提請援用·而日後或將被迫提請援用者、當均已深知熟悉、但對於調查團報告書中主要事實之指陳與此等義務有關者、則或尙未能一一明瞭、敢爲諸君綜括陳之、以爲參考、第一、調查團對於「中國現狀如此、應取消其國際聯合會會員國之資格、所有盟約中之保護各條欵、均不適用於中國」之理由、加以渺視、認爲不當、報告書稱一九二二年華盛頓會議中所始創、而包含於九國條約中之政策、其目的即在予中國以充分之時間及自由、俾不受外國之侵略、而得致力於國家之建設、此項政策、刻仍爲有關列强所關心、而爲維護世界和平之所必需、諸君若一觀去年二月間美國國務卿史汀生致參議員波拉之函、即可知其内容、特别致力所在、亦即在此點、調查團又稱、華府會議後十年以來、中國對於國家建設及鞏固工作上、已有不少可注意的進步、中國中央政府所受之唯一威脅、厥爲共黨主義、政府對於剷除共産主義、十分努力、並已擬定一種經濟復興政策、然日本侵略行動之結果、共産之活動、甚受鼓勵、而政府之努力、則横遭阻礙、惟余可爲諸君告者、自報告書完成後、中國政府對於剷共進行、已有確切的成功、軍事方面、大獲勝利、而種種造路計畫·農村計畫·徵信計畫·及其他扶助農民之計畫、均在逐一實施、成績極佳、爲計畫並實施此項工作及其他建設工作計、中國政府已聘請國聯專家多人、策助進行矣、至於東三省一地、報告書中固已指出其爲無庸置辯不可移易的中國國土、其居民之百分之九十三、皆爲華人、故在許多方面言、東三省與中國其他部份、完全相同、中間不過隔一長城、若强使與中國其他各部分裂、則將發生困難、危害和平、東三省之偉大農業發展、亦全係華人之力、東三省與中國其他各部之關係、在過去二十五年中、其密切程度、與日俱增、而在該地之實業及商業發展上、中國人民亦日見活動、東三省爲中國之庫藏、爲鄰近各省剩餘人口之出路、爲中國之第一道防線、而同時報告書又稱、東三省並不適宜於日本之移民、日本在滿洲之經濟利益、較之日本對中國全部市塲之利益、或對印度及美國之利益、尙地其次、日本在滿洲之條約上的權利、有時頗可疑問、而日本之對此項權利、往往出以偏面富有挑撥性的解釋、調查團稱、日本在滿洲之地位、乃得之於兩次戰事、實則兩次戰事之外、更可加一戰事的威脅、即一九一五年二十一條及最後通牒是、日本以是項方法等所獲得之權利、使中國在運及其國權上感受極大之牽制、故若是項地位、並非由雙方同意情願或接受者、則衝突之起、殆不可免、報告書又稱、日軍侵犯滿洲之前、絶無所謂獨立運動、「滿洲國」之計劃組織、以至成立、均係日本官員稟承日本軍部之命而進行、一切主權、悉握日當局之手、而爲中國居民所深痛疾惡、吾人若竟與以容忍及承認、實與現行條約義務不符、報告書又稱、中日爭端之起、即由於日軍之預定的侵略行爲、中國當局竭力避免任何挑釁行動、而解决中日懸案之和平方法、亦並未逐一用盡、報告書又稱、日本侵略行爲之結果、致東三省全境盜匪横行、種種不法事件、層出不窮、爲歷史上所未有、有組織的戰事、各處均在進行、人民所受痛苦、不可言狀、中日交誼形同開戰、前途亦僅見荆棘、最後、報告書中對日軍在陸相領導之下、公然計劃此項侵略計劃、並在報紙上鼓吹直接行動之事、亦已作一謹愼的暗示、日本開始其侵略計劃後、迄今已逾一年、中國政府始終以鎭靜正直的態度、以全案提交國聯、請求解决、中政府對日軍武力暴行及政治陰謀之控訴、已得調查團充分之證明、故中國及全世界之希望國際聯合會採取迅速决斷的步驟以求解决、此實其時矣、吾人深信日本之遷延時日、以實行其用武力或政治陰謀以增進形勢嚴重性之毒計、應不再爲吾人所容忍、而日内瓦世界和平機關之國際聯盟會、最後乃終將對全世界表示國聯之所代表者、乃爲公道與正義、並自有其决定解决爭議之辦法、及實施此項决定之勇氣也、</p>
<p>又在開會之前一夕、國聯廣播台請調查團團長李頓爵士演說、對於日本在報告書發表後之言論、竭力加以辯正、又百代公司請顧代表在有聲影片中演說中日關係、二人行動、最爲時人所注意云、</p>
<p>據一般觀察、此次松岡出席聯盟、可見日本已實行軍事外交、松岡在招待各國新聞記者時、竟公然謂「軍國主義、有時較善於外交政策、故吾人希望國聯能採取積極辦法、以解决東北問題、無殊望梅止渴、而且時日愈延長、義勇軍在東北之勢力愈削弱、反求諸已、萬不可全恃外交、除援助義勇軍繼續奮鬥、抵制日貨加緊經濟自衛外、並須從速與俄復交、與全國武裝起來也、</p>
<p>松岡演說、强詞奪理、不值一笑、但可供吾人參考、其攻擊吾人處、有則改之、無則加勉、故附錄焉、</p>
<h3 id="c50">日本之左傾團體 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>日本之左傾團體、就理論上言之、乃自馬克司主義至於無政府主義、自實際行動觀察、則應較社會民衆黨爲急進、換言之、即其所理想之前途爲社會主義、而其改革方案無論爲合法抑非合法、皆以打破現狀建立新社會爲目標、更無與軍部作尾尻之嫌、乃能謂之爲左傾團體也、然日本無産政黨、自一九二五年以來、如雨後春笋、到處萌芽、内容旣不甚堅實、分裂運動亦頗顯著、故普通選舉實施之初、僅有議員八名、迄於去年軍國主義突盛、法西斯帝國家主義普遍化以來、無産政黨各派、左制於非合法之地下運動、右脅於法西斯蒂之暴力、乃不能不趨於更加分裂之途、故現在議會中無産黨勢力微乎其微、四百六十六議席中、社會大衆黨僅有安部磯雄·杉山元治郎·編井貫一郎三名、脫離社會大衆黨而另立一派之松谷與二郎一名、此外掛無産黨招牌、暗中與軍部接近之國家社會黨議員小池四郎一名、總計僅有五個議席、設使國社黨除外、則無産政黨議員只四席而已、如不能得國民同盟之援助、則提案發言均無確實之地位、由此可見議會爭鬭之於左傾運動、因緣殊淺也、蓋日本衆院議員之選出、非有二十萬元日金之運動費不可、無産者代表安能舉出（？）、然而在此風雨飄諷中、議會政治根本動摇之際、信仰社會主義者竟能在軍國主義雰圍之議會聊作點綴、表示另一方面之意味、亦一奇觀也、</p>
<p>無産黨合法運動各派、内容原極複雜、（結黨之初、其派别計有十五以上）、不過經多次洗刷之後、現僅有社會大衆黨、（社會民衆黨與大衆黨合併而成）其政治綱領、㈠爲擁護工人·農民·及一般勤勞大衆之生活而爭鬭、㈡打倒資本主義、促成無産業及金融機關、皆由國家管理、勞動要産業及金融機關、皆由國家管理、勞動工人之生産的自給、建立確保生産者生活之勞動制度、完成社會保險、㈡土地國有、建立確保耕作權之土地制度、農業經營之（自主的）協同合作化、農業生産之機械化、國家統制重要農産物品、㈢經濟會議之建設、建立公費的勞動子弟敎育制度、住宅及醫院之公共經營、㈣工業與農業之融合、都市與農村之均衡化、㈤世界民族平等、世界和平之建設、</p>
<p>社會大衆黨之黨員總數約十二萬、其所能影響之工人農民、約計在二十五萬左右、城市工人因市面恐慌過甚、雖有失業威脅、加以合理化之實施、以致縮短工作時間、減低工資、於是社會情形愈趨惡化、去年一年中、罷工事件竟達二千四百五十六件之多、較之一九二六年時多至二倍以上、今年罷工事件、至十一月止已近二千、較之一九二九年當時竟至二倍半、此種運動、固非大衆黨所能指導、羣衆運動中、尙别有一種非合法的組織暗中活躍、</p>
<p>此非合法組織爲何、（？）盤施於歐洲之怪物、移至東亞之日本、即共産黨是也、該黨自始即爲一種秘密團體、且人數甚少、又多爲智識分子之組織、其實力原極脆弱、雖在各種公開的組織中、有敏㨗之活動然而經一九二八年三月十五及一九二九年四月十六兩次大檢舉之後、被捕人數逾一千名、重要分子多數被囚、指導運動乃完全停頓、加以政府之嚴重取締、右傾團體之極度壓迫、於是共黨之在日本、乃不能不入於地下運動狀態、但就所知、分述如下、</p>
<p>㈠共黨所影響之工運爲全（日本）國勞動組合同盟中左派羣衆、其人數約在三萬之下、</p>
<p>㈡共黨在全（日本）農民組合中、有農民委員會之活動、於佃農中已殖相當勢力、每次與地主爭鬥均有農民委員從中活動、（其所影響之羣衆不下五萬）、</p>
<p>㈢在軍隊中在右傾團體中、皆有共黨之黨團作用、且利用右傾團體之武器、實行其一部分之暴行計劃、如川崎第百銀行大森支店之刦案、共黨所保有之手槍、（經右傾團體入手者）、有百枝以上、</p>
<p>（四）宣傳刋物、有［紅旗］（月刋）但發行極困難、受其領導之刋物、有「國際」、（月刋）專門介紹共産黨之國際現勢、「産業勞動通信」、（旬刋）專門記載工農運動狀况、銷數頗不惡、「我們的科學」（月刋）則從馬克司列寗主義之觀點、解釋現狀「普羅文藝」（月刋）則爲純公開刋物、然其鋒利亦不在秘密刋物之下、故常被禁止發行、殊不知禁止愈嚴、而銷行愈快、</p>
<p>處此嚴厲壓迫之下、乃因社會矛盾過多、一般生活異常困難、縱有嚴刑峻法、亦不能阻止一般思想之「赤化」、而左傾之刋物、反而銷行極速、甚至司法尊嚴亦侵入「赤化」、由此可知日本社會問題之嚴重、雖肆力侵略、亦難遏抑革命運動之進行也、（十二月十九日於東京）</p>

<p>屠殺之後慘聲四起</p>
<p>浴血歸來還疑是鬼</p>
<p>北平通信、撫順平頂山日軍大屠殺事件、業由美國國際新聞社記者漢特氏前往視察後、發表紀事　譯載前報、茲有撫順難民張榮久者、於昨日逃來北平、詳述當時日軍行暴情况、張爲栗子溝人、當時舉家被騙上平頂山、家人全數遭難、其本人則以身被血浴　得以不死、乃於事後逃生、轉來北平、言時猶有餘悸、語畢、並謂若有半字謊言、必被天誅地滅、具見其悲憤之情、茲將其所談詳誌如次、</p>
<p>「我是撫順縣栗子溝的人、在九月十六的早晨、我們村裏、忽然來丁一隊日本兵、帶着一個會說中國話的繙譯、挨家的告訴、說日本軍隊　要借我們村莊、來演習戰鬥、敎我們住户、全都躱避到附近的平頂山山溝裏去、那時我們一家子六口人、我母親妻子兒子和我的兄弟朋久弟媳趙氏等、正在吃飯、我們正要告訴他吃完飯再走、可是那些兇悍的日本兵、一個個横眉瞪眼、手托着槍說、走、走、我們便顧不得收拾吃飯的傢伙、狠狼狽地跑出來、及至村口一看、全村裏的人、一個個扶老携幼、在一隊日本兵押解之下、向着平頂山而行、行到平頂山時、看見平頂山村的人、早就在那裏三五成羣、團坐起來了、有的說、日本軍隊要演砲、有的說、宣統皇帝派出欽差來放賑、可是正在議論紛紛的時候、又來了六七百莊稼人、有女人懷抱着小孩、有受人摟扶七八十歲的老太太、一樣由日本兵押着、來到這平頂山溝來了、原來這是千金堡的人、其中有我一個遠房親戚、呌佟二哥的、正揹着他的母親、我便向他招呼、敎他和我合坐在一起、忽然聽見一聲哨號、就看那些押解我們來的日本兵、及押解其他村民的日本兵、集合起來、又一陣口令聲、便在我們的四週分開、當中那幾個會說中國話的人、就對我們說、「現在皇上要分給你們錢、你們一個個跪起來謝謝恩、待我們先給照個相、然後來領賞」、說時、那些日本兵、正忙着在許多三脚架上、排佈像圓筒似的黑亮亮的東西、我們還以爲是照相機、可是看見我們村裏有幾個人一邊立起來要跑、一邊嚷着說、「不好啦、日本人要放機關槍啦」、說聲未了、便看見那我們想像的長筒照相機、乒乒乓乓冒出火光來、一時三千餘人、在東奔西跑、呼天喊地、呌兒喚女的大亂中、個個應聲而倒、我的兄弟、比我機警些、是先站起來要逃的樣子、可是那無情的槍彈、衝他個正着、一股鮮血直由腦門子衝出來、跌下來、剛剛伏在我的身上、我也隨之扒伏在地面上、一陣子鬼哭神嚎、天翻地覆的大亂過去、就聽見四週遠近、隠隠有哼哼聲、呻吟聲、哀痛聲、繼則聽有日兵說笑聲、叱咤聲、辱駡聲、槍刺使用聲、驚呼悽慘聲、悲鳴將絶聲、我在驚慌、和被我兄弟的屍體壓伏、並嚇得動彈不得的時候、半昏半醒的、覺得日本兵用皮鞋踢了我兩脚、可是我渾身全浸着我兄弟的鮮血、血淋淋地、日本兵以爲我是定死無疑了、又過了不知若干時、我聽見四週全無聲響、天也似昏暗了、我偷眼一看、見四週都是屍體、有的仰臥、有的伏倒、滿地都是些殷紅的鮮血、我好容易掙扎起來一看、活人是没有一個了、我的母親、我的妻子、我的弟媳、我的兄弟、一個個死去已久、創口還在流血、我的兒子、死的更慘、面目模糊、腦漿迸裂、我經過這陣慘變、我是瘋子一樣、傻子一般、自己也不知自己是人是鬼、是死了是活着、便竭力狂奔、想跑回村裏去、可是遠遠一望、我們村裏、熊熊的火光迄未熄滅、我這時神智已略略清醒、忽然想起對河的龔家溝還有一家親戚、我便連爬帶滾的、跑到那裏去、那親戚一看見我血鬼一般、驚得渾身發抖、他把我放進屋裏去、給一碗凉水喝、我半天才說出話來、第二天、他恐怕日本兵搜出我、連累他家、給我換上一身舊衣裳、凑集幾個盤錢、打發我進關投另外一家親戚來、我想我是吓壞了、我晚上常常在睡夢中起來狂奔、或是驚嚎、我的家人都死、我也不願意活着些、咳、這就是「滿洲國」國民所享的幸福、這就是無數東北人天天嘗着的滋味、我以上所說的、是我張榮久個人死裏逃生的親身經歷、若有半字謊言、必被天誅地滅」、（二十二日）</p>

<p>｜東北人民奮起爭鬥｜</p>
<p>東北人民之對於日本雖然懷恨、但在九·一八以前、却不十分激烈、即九·一八以後、也還没有成爲眞正的生冤家死對頭、所以「滿洲傀儡國」成立的時候、還有許多人替　捧塲、其中固然有些人是哭臉裝笑臉勉强應付、爲的是暫忍一時之氣、有的確實歡迎清朝復辟、特别是文化落後的地方、更覺着眞命天子出世是未來的幸福、然而經過了幾個月之後、非但他們的夢想不會實現、原來就以爲這是苦事的人、自然更覺得有涙無處流、當然絶對不許說話（如果三個人對話就容易犯罪）即原來贊同傀儡出世的人、也覺得有苦說不出、動輒得答、在傀儡墳堆裏做官的人、固然惟有在私室裏以涙珠洗面、一般商人·農人·也有些食不甘味、臥有安枕、其所以不安的原因、第一、是日本官一天比一天多、（據說凡是日本的失業知識分子和流浪者都羨慕滿洲做官的榮華、全來到滿洲做官、）他們的權力也一天比一天大、第二、是朝鮮的農民川流不息到東北來墾地、甚至驅逐原有地主、逼迫原地主佃户遷徙、由他們來居住耕種、於是弄得有地的人没有地而失業、原來做零工的人、就只好去當呌化子、因此東北人民憤恨日人已經由和數而轉變爲多數、各階級的人民、幾乎没有不痛恨日本的、這已經不是簡單的地主關係、而是民族仇恨的普遍擴大、我們東三省的人、大都另有一翻新認識、尤其是對日本的關係、眞正清算的時期、雖然還没有到、但已總有一天要和牠清算的、</p>
<p>現在大股頭的義勇軍、無疑地是失敗了、例如蘇炳文司令·張殿九·吳德林諸位將軍、舉義兩月、在冰天雪地之中勉强支撑着、子彈是打一粒少一粒、糧食是吃一天少一天、加以日兵一隊一隊的增加不已、同時　的迂迥攻擊、從索倫方面渡大興安嶺而北、以側擊海拉爾、飢寒交迫的義軍、焉能抵擋、然而失敗雖失敗了、東北的民衆從此醒覺、反日的情緒、却因失敗而愈加增高、蘇司令和他的部下縱然離了東北、可是東北的人民、并不曾自己出賣、至少是心裏不屈服、甘心替日本帝國主義作走狗的是少數中之少數、</p>
<p>所以自命爲征服者的日本、對義勇軍的活動、也十分戒備、據日本人說今年八九月間義軍人數不下二十五萬、照我們的計算、則在三十萬左右、不過現時「青紗帳」旣消、大股義軍不能不化整爲零、暫時潛伏、以待來年、可是目下還繼續活動、不斷對敵軍襲擊的各路義軍綜合計算、還不下十萬、所以打不贏的原故、是我軍較散漫、組織力不甚堅固、槍枝子彈、糧𥞊服裝、都很缺乏、人自爲戰的戰法、未免太舊了、不過四鄕騷擾到處勒索魚肉人民的所謂「靖安遊擊隊、」事實上可說班禪就西陲宣化使時攝影</p>
<p>（南京中華攝）</p>
<p>他是「侵安遊擊隊、」因爲牠來了、人民就不得安枕、大家没有法子、在遼寗各縣才有大刀會的組織、本月十五日　所謂「靖安隊」一大隊、跑到大石橋（南滿路的一個大車站）西邊土城子地方去打遊擊、和當地大刀會開了一仗、把牠的大隊長森大佐和小隊長木下中尉當場擊斃　還有永田·阿部兩少佐、高橋軍需等重要官佐、都受了重傷、現在日本方面正在調動大部隊準備施行牠屠殺的故技、</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>自從日軍侵入東北傀儡國成立以來、非但在長春地方日本官吏掛着「滿洲國」的招牌、横行無忌、即在各縣公署裏有新立名目的參事·秘書·指導官、和警查署的巡查、都由日本人充任、兩三個月前、大批的日本浪人、跑到滿洲來做官、與軍部或駒井·大橋一流人有特殊關係的、就可以做大官、否則也可以做做小官過癮、總之大軍事勢力支配之下、日本人眞是難犬飛昇、做大官當然支配「滿洲」全局、盡量剥削、而小官在各縣裏更是直接的榨取者、其魚肉老百姓、較之前清時代的官吏、何止數十百倍、因爲前清時代的官吏、大都粗疏、其榨取的方法也很笨拙、所以窮苦的百姓還可以在粗疏和笨拙當中求生存、而現在的日本人、學到了許多的新式榨取方法　確是密如牛毛、其取財之道、也是殺人不見血、例如烟草專賣、似乎還有可說、而人口清查的需索、眞弄得雞犬不安、凡是人民所有的利益、都一齊被他們奪去、甚至田地（墾出來了的）任他們隨意圈佔、弄得種地的農民無地逃生、因此東北人民對日本人的怨恨與時日俱增、凡是下鄕去的日本官和日本狗、都惹起當地人民的反感、所以前月鳳凰城的參事友田俊昭·秘書西辰喜·指導官白井成名·巡查藤井·賀門、表面上日本軍部稱他們是去說降義勇軍的勇士、其實他們是下鄕去搜刮、隨便那一個安分的老百姓、只要他家有幾個錢、就加給他一個「匪賊」的頭銜、敲詐些錢財、飽他們的私囊、殊不知恰巧遇着鄧鐵梅所部義軍、就給他們一個硬硑、五個「貪財好貨」的傢伙、一齊送命、現在日本開出去了一聯隊的步兵、附以砲隊·飛機·騎兵、正與鄧部約四千之衆、相持於蓋平之東摩天嶺　帶、不久的將來、終不免一場血戰了、（十二月十七日於瀋陽）</p>

<p>｜張天白君來信｜</p>
<p>（關於鮑祖宣君所提「鄕村敎育問題」之討論，鮑君原函見本月二十三日本欄）</p>
<p>鮑宜宣君所提出的「鄕村敎育」問題、確實是一個重要問題，然而我對於鮑君提出這一問題的態度，首先要加以商榷，然後再說他所謂鄕村問題是如何的一種問題。鮑君說··「打破現在的經濟組織的說法，未免有點好高務遠」。接着又說··「眼前的急迫問題，必須在眼前打破」。這是胡適的實騐主義的「玄學鬼」，在附着鮑君的身上說話。在鮑君的意思是說，眼前的急迫問題，不是中國整個社會的經濟組織（其實就鄕村說，不如說「土地所有的關係」）的改造，乃是鄕村敎育。這裡有個好比方，你在上海的工人區，拉着一個失業的工人告訴他說「你的問題不在你現在失業没工作，没飯吃，却在你没受到敎育，你且慢着，等我們來提倡工人敎育」。我們閉着眼睛可以猜到工人給你的回答··「請罷！請罷！」老實告訴你··現在鄕村的最急迫問題，不是什麽敎育不敎育，識字不識字，更不是如偉人們所說的，什麽提倡「孝悌忠信禮廉」，乃是鄕村極迅速地，極普遍地破産·，換句話說，鄕村的經濟關係的改造，才是「眼前」最急切的問題。至於鄕村敎育，倒不是普遍餓肚子，做盜賊。　妻賣子，流離失所的農民的急迫問題。這用是我們這些坐在租界上的洋房中，至少有衣着有飯吃的書呆子們的腦壳中所幻想出來的急切問題。鮑君所言，未免輕重倒置，這是一。鮑君說··「理論上的見解同時亦須顧到現實性的」。哈哈！這又是同樣的玄學鬼在作怪！假使你稍稍注意現在這樣不注重農村問題的中國報紙，你都可明白，各省的農民運動，如揚州的農民圍攻縣城，靈璧縣農民大騷亂等等，已經普遍地而且急切把農村經濟即農業問題提到議事日程上來了。鮑君還說是「好高務遠」！那我們的鮑君的「高遠」，眞敎人莫測了！鮑君還說是「須顧到現實性」，意思就是「鄕村經濟」的改造，還不成爲現實性的，那更是「高」矣，「遠」矣！「蔑以加矣」！這是二。我們曉得「敎育爲整個政治的一部門」。（申報十二月二十三日時評），而政治又是社會的經濟結構之上層的建築物。若果只談政治改革，而忽視了經濟結構的改造，那便是「與虎謀反」，也可以說是「皮之不存，毛將焉傅」。若果只談敎育而忽視了政治的根本問題與經濟的根本改造，那更是「不揣其本而齊其末」！更是「空中樓閣」！做那改良主義的烏托邦的迷夢！我並不是說鄕村敎育不可辦，更不是說，只注意政治與經濟的改造而不注意「普及敎育」的問題，乃是說，經濟組織不根本改造，政治没有相當的清明，什麽「普及敎育」，什麽「鄕村敎育」，都是白紙上寫黑字，欺人之談而已！說到這裏，篇幅已經不少了，暫以此請敎大衆。牠日再來討論「鄕村敎育」的實施問題。</p>

<p>我的丈夫是一個小商人，商業常識，非常熟練，他同我的感情，雖不能說十二分好，也還融洽，從結婚到如今幾年，我兩人愛情從未破裂過。我們在結婚後之第三年，就脫離家庭，另立門户，繼續又産生了一個小孩子，今年剛是三歲。可是，不幸得很，我們家庭經濟狀况，本已非常窘迫，在這當兒，我丈夫又突遭失業，消息傳來，幾乎我要自殺！不過，我因爲丈夫的關係，還是鎭靜着，反而時時想出種種說話，勸導我丈夫，給他以精神上的安慰，甚而比往日更體貼他，逢事必笑容可掬的同他商量。如此不知不覺，又過了八個月的光陰，我們日常生活幾全靠借債來維持。後來我丈夫實在再無心住在家裏「守株待兔」，就出門去謀事，但是，談何容易呢？他出門至今，共有四個月了，仍是一無眉目，四個月中，共寫回來四封家信，信裏的話頭，不是灰心悲僨，便是一些自殺的隠語，這情形實在危險極了！我們的家庭，實在再無法維持了！先生，我究竟怎樣來應付這個危險的家庭呢？我想去敝人家的女傭，可是在我們這窮鄕僻壤裏，誰人家要你？况且縱然我得到人家，我這三歲的小孩，又如何處置？讓他丢在家裏嗎？那末這種枯寂的環境，一定更使我丈夫增重悲觀，我萬萬不願的！先生，我究竟怎樣辦才對呢？請你以豐富的經騐，來指導我一下！</p>
<p>覆··士女來信，的的確確是現社會緊緊壓迫之下的一種悲慘痛苦的呼聲，而這呼聲，也不是女士個人的呼聲，而是很多很多的「大衆」的呼聲！從這裏面，我們可以嗅到不少血腥味！不過，女士要我們想個辦法來「指導」一下，這却非常爲難，因爲女士的痛苦，旣是「大衆」的痛苦，我們就决雖丢開「大衆」，單替女士想「辦法」，這一點，要請女士原諒！在這裏，我們祇有請女士同你的丈夫「忍耐應付」着，｜能同惡勢力奮鬥好。！「自殺」不但不能將問題解决，反更增重痛苦，聰明人是不幹的。目前是只有向前奮鬥，才能衝開一切，「光明」相信不久便會來臨的罷！</p>

<p>第四、實施方法槪要</p>
<p>（一）作業要項</p>
<p>通常初級中學歷史課程、往往僅由敎員講授、學生除受幾次考試外、卽尠其他作業、茲略舉本課程之各項重要作業如次、</p>
<p>㈠預習與複習　每一小時之敎材、須於前一小時規定敎本之頁數、令學生預爲閱看、使在聽講之前已有簡單槪念、敎授之後　並隨時令學生複習、隨時在敎室發問</p>
<p>㈡敎室筆記　敎本外之補充敎材、除尤重要者當編印講義或鈔示學生外、其他可令學生在敎室中就聽講所得、自作筆記、於課外加以整理敎者於相當時間檢查修改之、</p>
<p>㈢試作網要　敎者宜應用網要、以驭繁博之史實　助學生了解一面亦可指定敎本中簡明易曉之部分　令學生試作網要（卽將原文歸爲若干節、每節依次分爲小目、）</p>
<p>網挈領了解大意之能力</p>
<p>㈣試作歷史地圖與圖表　敎者於講授時除應用歷史地圖與圖表等外　同時可指導學生從事於此類地圖圖表等之製作、淺易地圖、可令學生試作　各圖表解、或定爲全級之課外作業、或指定數人繪製、又如歷史的圖畫或意想畫　亦可酌定原片　令長於圖畫者仿繪之、（此項地圖圖表之詳密有用者、卽可由校中歷史陳列室保存　以供永久應用、）至於空白歷史地圖中塡入地名、更可定爲共同作業</p>
<p>㈤閱書筆記報告試作短文　敎者宜指導學生閱覽簡明參考書、以培養其自學習慣閱覽所得　宜令學生摘錄筆記、輪流在敎室中報告、此外並可酌量程度　令學生作簡單問答題或短文、</p>
<p>㈥試作時事報告　重要的時事、除由敎者酌量報告外、同時亦可偶爾指定學生在敎室中報告本國時事與世界時事　報告後、由敎者加以指正與解釋、</p>
<p>㈦其他　此外可舉行古蹟考查之旅行、令學生就所見聞作成報告、於本國各項紀念日、校中舉行集會時　可令學生試行講演　或作聽講筆記又如歷史上大事或歷史上名人誕生紀念　敎者可酌量發起特殊的集會、學校舉行游藝會時　可應用敎材　編演歷史劇、此類特殊作業、均可由敎者因時因地酌定、</p>
<p>（二）敎法要點</p>
<p>㈠支配敎材　通常敎者於部敎材、往往詳於前而略於後、而在歷史課程、卽造成詳古略今之結果、或甚至因時間不足而遺棄最重要之近代史　欲免此弊　敎者應將全部敎材　預計時間　作輕重恰當之支配、製成「敎材進程」表、</p>
<p>㈡補充敎材　敎者於敎本之外、自當隨時補充敎材　但敎室中之鈔錄、不宜佔上課時間太多</p>
<p>特載</p>

<h3 id="c130">全國人民的分柝 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>▲普通的分柝</p>
<p>享上等生活之政界商界游界（守産者）　全國至多一百萬人　一·０００·０００人</p>
<p>工商界的職員　全國到多一千數百萬人　一五·０００·０００人</p>
<p>大中學生　全國不過三十餘萬人　三００·０００人</p>
<p>軍人　全國約二百萬人　一·０００·０００人</p>
<p>急需救濟的農民與工人　全國足有三萬萬六千萬人　三六０·０００·０００人</p>
<p>▲特殊的分柝</p>
<p>日本鐵蹄下的難民　約三千萬人　三０·０００·０００人</p>
<p>全國的烟民　至少數百萬人　五·０００·０００人</p>
<p>匪區的災民　至少數百萬人　五·０００·０００人</p>
<p>各省窮民　至少數百萬人　五·０００·０００人</p>
<p>對於特殊資料、應隨時自編補充講義、或節取他書以供應用</p>
<p>㈢提出中心　敎者於每個時期應提出本期歷史的中心　以昭示學生　使學生得收敎材聯絡及尋求系統槪念之效、</p>
<p>㈣善用講演　歷史敎法、自當標準　而以講演事實上不能不採用一種課本爲標準　而以講演爲敎法之中心、惟欲引起學生之興味與注意、講演法尤宜運用有方、如酌用故事式的講述、應用圖片　挿入問答、提出特殊問題等、</p>
<p>㈤採用網要　歷史事實緊複、學生常苦不易得其要領、爲輔助演講法揭示統係以增進學生了解起見、敎者宜將敎材提出網目、隨時說明、最好根據課本與必要的補充資料、編印網要、與敎本相輔而行、旣可供講演之參考、又可爲學生自習之助、</p>
<p>㈥注意比較聯絡　人類進化原是綿續不斷的、卽異地之史蹟、亦可互相印證、故敎者不但須注意前後之比較與聯絡、並當隨時謀本國史與外國史之比較與溝通（比較如中國與歐洲人用羅盤針之先後、溝通如漢與羅馬間之接交通、）則雖不取所謂混合形式、却已採納混合敎法之優點、</p>
<p>㈦指導參考書閱覽　敎者須酌量學生之程度、隨時指定簡明之參考書、令學生閱覽、或規定全級閱覽、或指定輪流閱覽、敎者均須與以充分指導、實現「輔導學習」之精神、</p>
<p>㈧注意時事與史事之聯絡　研究歷史、可知時事之由來、注意時事、可明歷史之應用、故敎者對於史事　在可能範圍内、當竭力使與現代社會發生關係、且於講授本國史時、可酌量報告國内時事　而與以解釋、以講授外國史時、可酌量報告國際時事而加以解釋、此外對於學生之閱覽報章雜誌、敎者亦當與適當的指導、</p>
<p>㈨參用公共紀元　中國歷代君主紀元紛更、歷史上的紀元標準遂成一大問題、爲求年代之準確與中外史蹟之聯絡起見、參用西歷紀元爲公共紀元、實爲比較便利之辦法、</p>
<p>㈩應用地圖圖表圖片　歷史地圖對於敎授歷史爲必要的工具、因大部份史蹟離去地理之背景、卽不能明瞭、此於講授各時間之疆域　戰爭、交通等時尤然、非就特殊之地圖或在普通地圖中指示不可、此外如歷史的圖表以及圖片古物模型等均有增進學生興味了解之效用、</p>
<p>㈩㈠其他　此外如歷史古蹟之訪問、足以引起學生對於前人或史事之相像、古學校可於學期中就附近古蹟、作考查的旅行、旅行中卽可爲學生講解關於本古蹟之故事、或令學生就聽講及參考所得作筆記、程度較深者、可指定局部問題、試作短文、方法甚多、須由敎者隨機應變、留心試騐</p>
<p>㈩㈡附歷史課程之設備　歷史學所研究之對象極廣、而已切合人生、故欲使學生得眞切之了解、必須有相當設備、學校當局必須打破歷史爲文學一類科學之觀念、而將歷史科設備與理化生理等科的標本儀器、視爲同樣重要、學校當特闢歷史陳列室或敎室、至少與地理科合設一史地敎室、大槪歷史科設備、主要者爲一·歷史地圖（掛圖）、二·歷史的圖表、三·名人畫像與歷史的圖片、四·各種古物（例如器物古碑雕噸等）、五·模型　如古物模型古建築模型）、此種設備或由購置、或由搜集、或由自製、均可在室内收藏或陳列、不惟敎授時可後說明、平時亦可爲觀摩之助、卽使限于經費、亦可就力之所及、先爲草創　漸謀擴充、</p>

<p>今日比賽之勝負、惟質嚴重、與錦標不無影響、此爲東華第一循環之末一比賽、目下成績東華七勝一負、得十四分、西捕六勝一負、得十二分、如東華得勝、則東華第一循環將得十六分、西捕最多不過十四分、如西捕得勝、則西捕一躍而上、將超出東華、第一循環可反以十六比十勝東華、第二循環東華欲努力、困難亦多、但深望東華今日能打倒此勁敵　分數之比例如下、</p>

<p>— 瑞典GustowCassel著謝菊曾譯</p>
<p>左文爲瑞典著名經濟學家開西爾氏最近所著、對於目下世界不景氣的主因、及今後救濟方法、有剴切的見解、未來的世界經濟會議中、對之將加以考慮、茲特譯載如下、</p>
<p>吾們處在這個從來不曾有遞的最富庶的世界、但是依然有幾千百萬的人、頻於餓死、同時世界上一部分人、暴露出可怕的貧窮來、一天多似一天、至少有二千萬的良善的工人、没有工作可找、而只能找到半天工作可做的人、日見增加、許多的私人商店和整個的貿易、後先毀滅、而無法償付他們債務的國家、也一天多似一天、</p>
<p>賴債不還和欠債還不出、旣然是這般普遍　他們已開始抛棄自然的事實、再也没有尊重義務的觀念、這樣的下去、眞是整個社會秩序的極大危險、横流所及、不知底止、爲什麽人類不能充分利用偉大的富源加以處置呢、爲什麽吾們不能提高生産、好使繁榮一年增加一年、以便大家來亨用這個繁榮呢、</p>
<p>這個問題的一個最普通的解答、就是在一九二０年以後的八九年中、進步得實在太快、所以結果免不掉開倒車、但是切不要相信這些話、</p>
<p>有許多人的見解、以爲今後必須減低生産率、給予消費的時間、以便供求趨於平衡、還完全是没有意義的話、消費量是决於生産本身的、生産的結果、决不致形成吸收量過分狹窄、</p>
<p>復次、在統計上可以證明一九二二年至一九二九年間、關於生産的發展、就通常論並没有異乎尋常的增加、當時的經濟生活、僅不過恢復戰前的進行率、這是没有理由爲什麽這樣的進行、不應繼續下去呢、</p>
<p>所以那些認定一九二九年投機狂的登峯造極、爲日後經濟衰落的重要原因、也一般地不能成立、當然、在美國、像證券交易所的狂抬股價、爲後來股價猛跌的主因、但若說證券交易所這一種的調節、就是使生産和消費的機械、給牠一個大搗亂、竟是不成話說、</p>
<p>那末、爲什麽這健全的發展、半途裏會遭逢這般的不幸挫折呢、除了說世界貨幣結構破裂之外、再也没有别的回答、而且也没有别種回答的必要、這是很簡單的一種貨幣結構管理極不善的結果、當一九二０年以後的初期　世界大多數國家都回復到金本位、這事著者在一九二０年已經說過、爲了金貨的供給無多、只有各大國從事合作於一個熟慮的金貨節約政策、對於貨幣上的需要金貨、爲一種有制度的限制　如此方能使金本位具有充分的穏定性、這個政策、天然包含異國間金貨的合理分配在内、倘有幾國要拖進許多金貨向自己腰包裏去塞　那就當加抑制、假使在某一時間内、眞能大家施行這個金貨節約政策、如此世界也可享受大大的進步和繁榮了、</p>
<p>但是、這個平衡繼續受着一種嚴重局勢的威脅　這就是賠欵的償付和戰債的負擔了　這類的支付、顯然是越出世界的尋常支付機能之外、倘使這　機器不能調節、橡把戰債弄成有支付的可能之顃、那末最後的一着、便是債務國被迫輸出金貨、由債權國來接收這些金貨、來抵充償付、</p>
<p>這其間便是要推美法兩國爲最了、假使他們减低了他們的關稅率一面又表示盡力予債務國以償付的便利　不論用貨物或服務來代替、都可接受、如是這椿支付轉賬的特别困難、就可免除了、但是事實正好相反、兩國都增加了他們的關稅率、并且用盡九牛二虎之力來限制這等方法的償付、因爲恐爲他們的内國市塲遭受外貨競爭的排擠、</p>
<p>但是、雖然有了這個關稅保護政策、而支付平衡的調節、暫時仍能達能、因爲受欵國願意擴展巨量的信用於世界、例如法國大都積存短期餘額於海外、而美國則供給世界巨量資金、已歷多年、因此國際的支付平衡、總算還能很順利的維持着、</p>
<p>不過這個制度、並没有眞正的穏定性、只要那幾國對於輸出資金一旦表示不願意、那末這個制度立見崩潰　這可以拿法國爲證、當一九二八年中間、法國恢復金本位　她便開始積聚大宗金貨、半由她前此所置的海外餘額的帮助、於是資金輸出一變而爲輸入　再說美國　國内對於資金的需要、日見增加、而自一九二九年證券風潮以來、美國的資金輸出力量、天然大受打擊、同時歐洲的德意志、也已耗盡她的借欵能力了、</p>
<p>處在這種情形之下、戰債的繼續償付、不過𦔳成法美兩國堆置大宗的金貨、而結果遂將世界其他各國的金貨存量、大形减少、這些存量在平時每年約增加百分之三、爲了上面的變遷、結果到了一九三一年、竟歉缺了百分之二三、至於法定限度以上的金凖備比例的减少、當然不在話下、結果遂予世界市場上的物價競爭以一種嚴重的壓迫、而全世界物價、遂呈空前的慘落、</p>
<p>在這裏需要說明一下、就是爲什麽法美堆積了大宗的金貨、從不曾産生出一些償付的功能、來好使受欵國的國内物價、爲之提高、根據金本位自動作用的古典主義　這般的物價上漲乃是金貨流入後所立起的影響、而一發生了這個影響之後　就可阻遏金貨的流入、最後便成爲一個反轉的局面、</p>
<p>但是、法美兩國對於所得的新金貨　力戒利用於這顃目的上面、所有大部分的金貨、僅不過窖藏於中央銀行的金庫、而信用限制政策的結果之一、不但這些國内的物價不能提高、甚且大見下落、不因金貨的繼續流入而稍變、</p>
<p>槪括地說、戰債的償付、同了不願接受尋常的貨物來替代、遂使對於世界貨幣上的金存貨、起了不合情理的需要、而原告們又不將積聚的金貨、供適當的利用、於是全世界的物價、又安得而不大跌特跌呢、</p>
<p>許多喪失了金貨的國家、到了山窮水盡、便被迫放棄金本位、他們鑒於國内有幾種的物價和工資、不能撓屈、尤以他們公私債務的負担爲最、因此覺得減低國際間的物價平準、實不可能、他們没有别的改變辦法、只有放棄金本位、以便割斷國内物價與金價的關係、結果世界上的整個金本位制度、遂完全瀕於破裂、</p>
<p>處在這環境下第一椿要做的事情、就是我們目下所面對着的、顯然是設法移去這等不幸發展後面所伏着的最後結果、因爲這個緣故、所以爭嚷着賠欵與戰債必須取消、不過、吾們應該明白此項取銷運動的眞意義、</p>
<p>現下差不多已有十二年以上的經騐、證明戰債和賠欵的償付、乃使世界的貨幣機構趨於毀滅之途、目前的恐慌、已足證實世界的經濟生活、再也没有忍受這等境遇的可能、因此世人們絶端關心於此等政治性的償付的革除、這事看上去犧牲似乎很大、但若和目下恐慌所釀成的種種禍患比較起來、簡直如滄海之一粟罷了、</p>
<p>美國全年所得的戰債償付、實際還不到美國人民因現下不景氣所遭受的損的的百分之一、所以取銷戰債　實是繁榮商業的好方法、而全世界也可以因之有昭蘇之望、</p>
<p>這是無可疑的、戰債的歷次償付、已使世界遭受了這般的破壞、所以今後單只取銷戰債、還是不夠、必須再用積極的手段　來恢復繁榮、這其間最理要最迫切的需要、便是提高物價、因爲那些物價、完全没有自然下降的必要、只因世界貨弊制度的管理不善、生生地把批發物價、零賣物價、生活費、工資、及債務利息間的關係、弄得崎嶇不平、要使這個不平衡變成平衡、惟有提高批發物價的一法、</p>
<p>人們惑於已往的敎訓、所以一聞提高物價之說、便竭力反對、要知道在平常環境之下、膨脹確不是一件十分好事、但是假使吾們方纔從强迫的緊縮裏出來、那末實有採用相當的膨脹方法的必要、藉以療治因緊縮所致的病症、</p>
<p>但是、這一種膨脹計畫、在開始的當兒、必須置於當局控制之下、并且必須使大衆明白一個嚴確的膨脹程序、其目的當以提高物價與一九二八年的物價標準相接近篤準則、</p>
<p>假使這個計畫被認做國家的正式政策、施行自易收效、人民便可瞭解這不是無節制或無限制的膨脹、對於他們貨幣的前途、用不着憂慮、在另一方面說、他們相信物價的上漲、自然地會引導生産家再努力於生産、至於這事所仰仗於當局方面的、只要制定一個確切的目標、和採用一個確切的政策、努力以赴之便是、</p>
<p>自然、這個計畫、假使世界上一般主要貿易國、像英美等、能携手合作、更可增加許多的信用、如果他們對於提高自己貨幣的物價的一個普通政策、能夠達到諒解、他們便有左右世界的能力、其他各國、自然也爭先恐後來加入這個政策了、</p>
<p>這椿舉動、當然没有延到國際經濟會議召集以後的必要、如果這二個領袖國家　對於提高物價的第一步工作、先行着手做起、無可疑地可使這個會議的進行、格外來得容易、</p>
<p>關於恢復金本位的一事、那是不成問題的、在眼前若努力去幹這椿事情　未免失之過早　而國際貨幣制度是否有恢復金本位的可能、也是疑問、在若干重要條件未曾履行之前、當然是不可能的、</p>
<p>取銷戰債、是這些條件的第一步、第二步但是協定一種有組織的金貨節約政策、包括減削各國中央銀行對於金準備的慣例需要在内、第三條件便是恢復國際貿易及國際資金移動的相當自由、你决不能有一種任何穏定的國際貨幣制度、假使牠不曾根據着一種連帶的可靠和穏定的國際經濟制度、</p>
<p>凡是嚴切注意於這些條件的人、立刻可以認識如果在經濟會議之前、提出一個恢復國際金本位制度的問題、不但没用、而且反形不美、惟一的結果、便是無窮盡的討論、終於不成一事、</p>
<p>國際間對於經濟上的合作、像恢復國際間貨物及資金的移轉自由和安定、一如歐戰以前的情狀、這實在有不可須臾緩之勢、所有限制外國匯兌交易及進口數量的整個制度、必須首先撤銷、繼之則爲减低關稅率、而後國際間的貨物交換、始能儘量潑展、這實在是緊榮世界的必要條件、</p>
<p>照我們看來、這個恢復工作、必須三方面同時進行、戰債必須取銷、物價必須提高、而某種貿易自由、必須恢復、若互相觀望、或是後先施行、那是一些没有用處、我們必須立刻就做我們不能再行觀望、否則不但我們的經濟破産便在眼前、而西方文明、也隨之完結、好在洛桑會議已做下了很好的工作、將横亘在復與途上的主要障礙除掉、這正是積極工作開始的時候了、</p>
<h3 id="c152">廣東省鹽務最近槪况 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>全國鹽務稽核機關之增設、係根據借欵合同而起、考民國二年、五國善後借欵成立、吾國鹽政遂受外人之監督、迄今已二十年矣、吾國鹽基南京、前財長古應芬氏曾一度將鹽務稽核機關歸併於各該當地之鹽運使署、是稽核與行政兩部份由分而合者也、議成未久、宋子文氏繼任、又將原併之稽核機關重行恢復、是則又由合而分者也、廣東卽其一例、茲將廣東省鹽務之最近槪况、略述其要焉、</p>
<p>粤省一隅、地處四南、因政治上之情形特殊、迄今仍維持原狀、未便有所變更、故雖有最近稽核長官兼任行政之議、如兩浙·兩淮·山東·以及揚子四岸等處然、而粤省則仍循舊規、行政與稽核獨立如故、粤省之鹽務行政機關爲兩廣鹽運使署、各地之運副署及榷運局鹽警隊等、均歸其統轄、至稽核機關、則由廣東鹽務稽核分所主其事、於汕頭北海兩處、設有潮橋及平南櫃二稽核支所、於惠州陽江汕尾三處、則設有東江恩春及海陸豐三稅局、綜計全區大小局卡、約有七十餘處、征收稅欵　年計鉅萬矣、</p>
<p>粤鹽行銷兩廣及閩黔贛滇等省、其在廣東行銷者、爲南海等八十縣、其在廣西行銷者、爲懷集等七十五縣、其在湖南行銷者、爲鄙縣等十一縣、其在江西行銷者、爲贛縣等十七縣、其在福建行銷者、爲長汀等八縣、其在貴州行銷者、爲荔波等十縣、而淮粤並銷者、僅貴州之錦屏一縣而已、至運銷辦法、則由專商承包、月銷若干擔、例如在廣州、則由宏泰公司承包月銷二十一萬七千擔、運商復有上下河之别、下河運商、均得赴塲運鹽、回省開配、上河運商、則專司販運矣、凡包商請放鹽斤、均須向該地稽核所領取繳稅單、持向中央銀行繳納稅欵、經銀行蓋章證明收訖後、再持向發單之稽核機關、領取放鹽准單、再携同准單、赴運使署會蓋關防、領取運照一切手續、方稱完備、至按月承銷餉額、得分次繳、惟大多已有預借數月餉額者矣、</p>
<p>前節旣述粤省鹽務行政及稽核部份仍係獨立、其權限亦不互相混雜、凡簽發運照、管理鹽塲、以及緝私等事宜、均歸兩廣鹽運使署執行之、至凡征收鹽稅、發給放鹽准單、秤放鹽斤、彙總鹽稅報告表册、及清償鹽務外債等事項、則由廣東鹽務稽核分所負責執行之也、</p>
<p>粤省鹽稅之收入、以民國二十年之指數算、約佔全國鹽稅之總歲人十分之一、計國幣千萬元强、其稅類名目、亦殊繁多、綜其大者、則有國省稅之别、屬於國稅者、有正稅·外債附加稅、及雜稅三項、如坐配稅·附塲路担稅·漁鹽稅·及私鹽補稅、均屬於正稅者、而水程費·配費·料船用鹽憑准費·漁船用鹽憑准費·鹹餉·包餉·私鹽充公變價罰欵·𧒄捐·漁水捐·閩鹽運汕釐金·閩鹽運汕附加稅、則屬於雜稅者也、至省稅一項、前有二成中央紙幣附加稅、現已停止征收、現有購造緝私艦附加稅、在汕頭一處、則前有潮梅治河捐、今已改爲剿匪捐矣、至歲支情形、除按月撥支行政緝私經費、及稽核經費以外、尙須匯解攤還外債額欵、其餘存稅欵、除省稅項下之購艦附加稅、送兩廣鹽運使署收存、及剿匪捐交東區綏靖公署移用外、彙總解財政特派員公署、轉撥粤省一切軍政費之用途也、</p>
<p>粤省稅率、爲每担課正稅大洋二元五角、及外債附加稅大洋三角、省稅另加　至料船漁船用鹽憑准單、則分級征收、各有定額、其他亦同一律</p>
<p>粤省鹽務稽核部份之會計制度、自民國二十年七月一日起、劃分前後爲二大時期、以前時期而論、所謂財務賬目、僅係編製一種報告、並無有一定系統之會計制度或賬册可供隨時參閱、蓋稽核所成立之初、卽襲用海關所採用之舊式賬目也、至去年七月一日、稽核所推行葛佛倫氏（Dr·F·A·Cleveland現任稽核總所會辦）之新式會計制度、於賬目上遂起爲一大改革、推行迄今、爲時僅一載又半、而成績斐然、殊爲難能可貴、是不得不推頌葛氏及稽核長官銳意整頓之功也、蓋會計制度之要點、厥在出納會計與稽核三部份之獨立、俾得内部牽制、而减少舞弊、是葛氏推行新式會計之所在意也、至其他賬目簿册報告等之編製、均甚精密、吾愛好會計同志、盍興乎來作一詳細研究哉、</p>
<p>上述廣東鹽務情形、僅屬鳥瞰、掛一漏萬、在所不免、蓋爲作者思憶所及、隨筆述要、尙望讀者有以敎之、（弘毅）</p>

<p>— 珂譯</p>
<p>第二章　貨幣之本位</p>
<p>由此觀之、在此制度下、金銀之價格有一定之標凖、惟此種情形又可以另一方式表示之、卽可謂錢幣之價格係固定者、每一錢幣可易若干之金或銀、（註一）</p>
<p>在此種情形中、有一至要之點蕴涵於内、而此點卽爲一切困難之源、在複金本位之制度下、金銀之交易價格、由政府以法令規定之、於一相當之比率下、此比率一經厘定後、如欲更改之、則非費極大之力不爲功、而其間又恒引起各種之財政上及商業上之紊亂、此金銀間之法定比率多少爲一武斷者、彼雖間或能反映二者之比較價值、然亦祇能相符於一極短之時間内、而不能經久不變也、其所以然者、因金銀亦係商品也、與米麥皮革等正同二者間之價值固時有起落也茲姑假定、當令下之日、金銀之交易、價值在供求、勞働及運輸成本之公式下　爲一對十六之比、故金銀之比價卽定爲一對十六、但在第二日、忽有新金礦發現、吾人由之可以較低之成本、取得大量之黃金、同時又有一大銀礦爲水所掩而不能生産、隧此之外、尙有一新工業勃興、需用大量之生銀、其結果金漸充斥而白銀乃感稀少、設金銀有一公開之市場、則二者價格間之比率將立起變化、金價將跌而銀價必漲二者價值之比率、必不能止於十六對一之平線上矣、</p>
<p>近數十年來、銀之産額大增、一方面因由新銀礦之開發而來、而在另一方則冾金術之進步、使大量之純銀、能由其他金屬中提煉而出、因之純銀之供給、乃遠超出於其需要量之上、而其價格亦隨以大跌反之在黃金方面、則一般之專家恒憂其少、每慮不足以供用、雖其中不無杞人之思、而其價格則固已激漲矣、</p>
<p>吾人於上文已曾言之、金銀如有公開之市塲、則其價格之起落、亦將與其他物品之價格起落同　卽由供求兩方决定之是也在複金本位之國家中、則並無此等公開之金銀市塲、其政府恒以固定之價格、於任何時期下、購進或售出金銀、惟公開之金銀市塲、雖不能得之於複金本位之國家中、而在國際間則恒可得之、世界各國初未曾團結爲一、而遵守一共同之金銀價格比率、在各國中、其金銀價格之比率恒各各不同、有時單本位之國家又恒以其非法幣之一金屬作爲普通商品而任意買賣之、其結果則金銀價格之比率紊、而複金本位制度之弊害叢生矣、</p>
<p>任何國家採行複金本位後、則經過相當之時期、其國所有之貨幣、必有一種將掃數流之外國、此項損失力能破壞商業之進行減少進出口貿易之數量、使公衆成爲貧乏、而造成一般之混亂、</p>
<p>何以其國貨幣之一種將掃數流之國外、稍一察之、卽可知其中之理由至爲簡單、依據經濟原理、商品流至價格最高之市塲、故以金爲價高之國家得金而失銀、以銀爲價貴之國家、失金而得銀、其間之流轉初非任何法律或威力所能阻止、因人固願冒險以求利、金銀流轉之間、大利存焉、故雖有法禁仍將趨之而不顧也</p>
<p>此次情形可以例明之、美國於一七九八年、經罕密頓AlexanderHamilton之努力、由國會通過、採行複金本位、規定一盎司之純金可易十五盎司之純銀、其後法國釐定金銀之比價爲十五·五對一、於是美金競流至法、而法銀乃充斥於美國市場、一八三四年、美政府改定金銀之比價爲十六對一、其結果、則美國市場上之現銀乃悉數流至其他銀價較高之國而歸烏有矣、在英國亦有同樣之情形發生</p>
<p>此種情形之敎訓、究屬何在　以金易銀與以銀易金間、究有何差别、吾人稍一深察　卽可知其間困難至多、今姑舉其一以槪其餘、在此情形下一國對於市場上流行之貨幣數量卽無法以調節之其理由約有三端、㈠以金易銀、在價值及數量上或可相等、但所易得之金銀乃異國之貨幣或地金也　故必須重鑄方可流通於市面、㈡貨幣之出入、途中延擱頗久、故無人能知一時所有之確實數目、㈢有時一種貨幣之價格較大於他種貨幣、凡此種一切、咸使貨幣之供給發生摇動而其品質亦時時變易、於是葛蘭香之定律即發生效力、良幣流出而劣幣充斥、一切之價格隨以變動、而經濟之安寗爲之破壞矣、</p>
<p>且一國採行一種之硬幣爲本位而以他種硬幣供用、在事實上亦至不便也、</p>
<p>諸如此類之困難至爲繁多、今不再縷述、但此並非謂複金本位之學說謬謨者、亦非謂在國際統一金銀比價下、此制亦不能順利進行也、在事實上、複金本位之制度、在法國曾有良好之效果、卽在其後之拉丁貨幣同盟中、（包括法·意·比·瑞士·希臘）亦曾順利運行也、</p>
<p>主張複金本位制度者之學說大致如下、</p>
<p>金銀二物、如同時鑄爲法幣而可相互爲用、則市場上對於貨幣之需要將使二者以相當比數之數量流通於市面、雖此二者同爲商品而有不同之工業或其他用途、然其影響不足以轉移其流行之數量比率也、（未完）</p>

<p>燕子姑娘（二）</p>
<p>— 葉風</p>
<p>老靶子路一家臨街三層樓的一間小房，她把我領到那裏，說是她臨時的住所，已經住了五天的住所。</p>
<p>「是我的朋友瑪麗住的，瑪麗在藍花咖啡店做招待，是我在菲律濱的朋友，今天到南翔辟克惶克去了。我在上海祇認識她一個人。」</p>
<p>望着單人的小鐵牀，撩起一半的窗帘布，愛爾蘭陶器的小壷，開着蓋的柯狄面粉，我覺得這就是我自己臥室的化妝像，一個飄泊靈魂的没有住所的住所。</p>
<p>「那麽，你一人住在此地，預備怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>讀了半生的小說，做了半生的流浪人，我慣於用自己的腦經想着不是自己的事。</p>
<p>「你看，這就是他，是他呌我來的。」</p>
<p>她揭開放在牆角没有鎖上的箱子，眼睛也不望，很練熟的摸出了一張照片，走過來　給我，站在我的一旁。</p>
<p>一個大輪廓的中年男子，濃濃的眉毛，闊嘴唇，可是却有兩隻憂鬰的小眼睛。</p>
<p>照片的下角傾斜的寫着··</p>
<p>ToMyLitterSwallow</p>
<p>再底下是一個不易認識的簽名。</p>
<p>「這就是你的名字嗎？」我問。</p>
<p>「他們總愛這樣的呌我。」</p>
<p>「他在上海做什麽呢？」</p>
<p>她笑了一笑，似乎是要爲她朋友不名譽的職業抱歉的笑。</p>
<p>「從前在菲律濱做水手酒吧裏的助手。現在在上海做｜我不知道他現在究竟做什麽。」</p>
<p>「認識了很久嗎？」</p>
<p>她打開手提袋，拿出了兩根長長的紙烟，送一根到自己的嘴上，遞一根給我。</p>
<p>我摇摇頭。</p>
<p>「此刻不用了。」</p>
<p>她將給我的一支紙烟丢在牀上，劃亮了火柴，點上自己嘴上的烟，吸了一口，噴出一口的烟圈。</p>
<p>「你們男子總是這樣的。有用的時候就要，不用的時候就摇摇頭。認識了他三年，他丢了我六次。受了旁人的騙，再回到我這裏。忘記了旁人的騙，又跑到旁人那裏。我從菲律濱跑到檀香山，從檀香山跑到澳門，從澳門回到菲律濱。上海已經是第二次來了。跟着他，像春天一樣，我度着燕子的生活。」</p>
<p>她微微的嘆了一口氣，望着窗外的天空，吸了一口烟，仰着頭，緩緩的將吸進去的烟噴了出來。</p>
<p>「我不是這樣的。」我說，「她跟旁人走了，從不曾再回來過。我等了好幾個春天了。」</p>
<p>「不過，」她說，像是安慰我，又像是安慰自己，「我相信，他一定會回來的。她也一定會回來的。你說是嗎？」</p>
<p>我早已不相信，可是我祇好說··</p>
<p>「是的，我相信，一定會回來的。」</p>
<p>第一次見到她小小的臉上展出了笑容。</p>
<h3 id="c159">外强中乾的文人 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 蘆隱女士</p>
<p>不錯，要想把一塊文人的招牌，掮在肩上，至少不能不放浪形骸之外，最漂亮的是在錢上看得輕鬆，好像當了褲子去玩妓女，最是曠達的人生。本來從前唐朝詩人李太白他就是個文人們最好的榜樣｜所謂「五花馬，千金裘，呼兒將出換美酒，與爾同消萬古愁」！又說··「千金散盡還復來」！這種浪漫的𤍠情的行爲，夠多值得人們的艷羨，也就難怪現在文人滿嘴裏不在乎錢了。</p>
<p>文人們雖然把錢看得非常輕鬆，但是一切非文人｜如米店的掌櫃，煤店的老闆，他們可是非錢不交易，這可眞和文人過不去，文人在大庭廣衆中，把錢看作糞土，而骨子裏呀，他們却深切的了解錢的偉大，和壓迫，因此裏外不調協，遂生出種種的矛盾的結果｜</p>
<p>············</p>
<p>在一天日麗風和的下午，一羣不衫不履的文人，圍在一張長方形的餐桌旁。</p>
<p>什麽危士忌呀，三砲台呀，土司，啤酒，堆了一桌子，那些文人得其所哉的便放浪於形骸之外了。你一瓶我杯豪哉飮也！</p>
<p>不久太陽下山了，文人中的一位尤先生站了起來說「是時候了，我們散吧」！茶房早已預備好的賬單，用了個小盤裝着，恭而且敬的遞了上來，尤先生接過來一看三十塊零五角，便很慷慨的從皮夾子裏拿出一束票子來，悄悄一數整整三十一塊二角，他把三十一元大洋遞給茶房，本想說聲不要找了，但是一想到家裏的妻子還等着買糖回去給孩子吃呢，於是他連忙嚥下一口吐沬道··「找來」。茶房哼了一聲走了，找了五角錢來，尤先生從袋裏掏出原先剩下的那兩毛小洋放在茶盤裏，那五毛大錢，就收在皮夾子裏了，那茶房冷笑着「呸」了一聲，當他們走出去時，聽見茶房喃喃的說，什麽「赤老」也來充闊少，尤先生聽了這話，只反耳朶聳了聳，算是滿不在乎的包涵了。</p>
<p>尤先生回到家裏，剛一遍門妻便趕了出來說「喂，你到底怎麽打算，房東又派人來催房錢，他說已經三個月不給房錢了，如果再没有辦法，不客氣要請我們搬家呢，」</p>
<p>尤先生『哦』了一聲，舉起右手摸着腦袋，自心裏計算··「要說弄錢，我老尤的本領不算壞，只要有可鑽的窟窿，我都鑽到了，這個月好和歹也弄到三百塊錢，可是我身體不好，要吃些滋陰的補品，南興居每天𤍠窩甲魚，就去了一百多塊。還有呢，阿蘭那個俏妮子，也敲了我一百多元，唉，眞他媽的該倒霉｜本來還可以發一筆小横財，偏偏碰見那個姓張的寃家，要查起書局的賬來，不然那一筆印書的欵至少也可以扣下三分之一救救急啊！」</p>
<p>妻子見他只是出神，不作聲，但耐不住，發氣道··「你到底打的什麽主意，莫非就擱下不管嗎？」</p>
<p>「你别急，這算什麽呢？難道我這樣一個大名鼎鼎的作家，還養活不了你嗎？你們女人們總是這麽小器，」</p>
<p>「别吹牛了吧？你們文人除了一張嘴外還有什麽？······平常日子我稍稍勸勸你，你就什麽文人不在乎錢，又是什麽偉大，看你現在去偉大去，我眞不明白，偉大賣多少錢一斤？···」妻說着不禁噗哧一笑，尤先生也就趁此忙下臺階，恭恭敬敬和太太作了一個大揖說道「好了，太太！」</p>
<p>「你不用和我裝這副面孔，我從裏到外看透了你！」</p>
<p>「你看透了我什麽？」</p>
<p>「看透你呀，哼，一個外强中乾的無聊文人」</p>
<p>「好駡！好駡！」尤先生右手摸着後腦枸子，嚥了一口吐唾，仍然是大量的包涵了。</p>
<h3 id="c160">聖誕節的禮物 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 王女士</p>
<p>靈巧的，美麗的，花的紙匣中，放着一個紅的聖誕老人和三隻會唱歌的小鳥。｜琪姐冒着冬的嚴寒遠遠的把這禮物送來給我。</p>
<p>夜間，在工作的疲勞中，在陌生的一羣裏，剛道過無謂的寒喧後，腦子昏亂着，挾着一顆孤寂的心，從十分閙𤍠的人羣裏，悄悄地踱了回來。</p>
<p>子裏是寂莫的。</p>
<p>推開了玻璃窗，仰望着天空，星星熌燿着清澄的光輝，我輕微的透了一口氣，回轉頭來，桌子上立着一手拿着紗袋，一手拿着冬青樹，有着雪一般的白的長鬚的聖誕老人，在望着我笑，我驀然的憶起是聖誕的季節了！却感傷的笑了起來。</p>
<p>在夢一般的朦朧的記憶裏，喚回了天眞的，快樂的童年生活和糢糊的可愛的母親的面影。</p>
<p>時光像水一般，很快的流去了十年。</p>
<p>那時，我和别的一些幸福的孩子們一樣，有仁慈而善良的母親，更有一個快樂的家庭······</p>
<p>小時候，最高興最歡迎的，便是過新年了，然而，爲了母親是一個虔誠的基督敎徒的原故，聖誕節的印象在幼時却很深的刻在腦海裏。</p>
<p>每一個敎徒的家庭，都忙着慶祝的典禮，我的家也同樣的·，父親總在十天前便忙着買冬青樹，買光亮的銀邊，買紅白的　燭，買聖誕老人，更買許許多多好玩的東西。母親專忙着替我織絨繩外衣，做花鞋子，在晚間彈着披亞娜敎我唱「至聖夜」的歌。</p>
<p>在聖誕節的夜裏，把費了幾天工夫裝飾好了的大聖誕樹，放在屋子的中央，地上散滿了雪片似的白紙，台子上點了大而輝煌的燭，和聖誕樹上的許多紅白燭映成幽默而恬靜的光輝，散在油綠的墻壁上，爐子裏燃燒着紅紅的火，我換了新的衣服，在猜想父親和母親送給我的聖誕禮物。母親幽靜的彈披聖娜，於是「至聖夜」的歌聲，在這深夜裏傳了出來。</p>
<p>我們的心跳躍着喜悅的𤍠情。｜</p>
<p>就在十歲的那年，母親便抛棄了我離開這黑暗的世闆長逝了！</p>
<p>時光像水一般，很快的流去了十年。</p>
<p>然而，有時引起了這傷心的回憶時，我會漫然的感到苦惱，我用堅强的毅力來壓抑我的眼涙，我獨自的跑到墓塲，跑到鐵軌的旁邊，對着天空，對着枯了的老樹，在心靈的深處，靜靜的傾吐着我的哀愁。</p>
<p>我想到母親曾經是怎樣的愛過我，爲了要使我在這世闆做一個「眞正的人」，曾經費過了多少可貴的犧牲，我更一再想到幼時的快樂的家園。</p>
<p>今夜，在工作疲勞中，在陌生的一羣裏剛道過無謂的寒暄後，腦子昏亂着，挾着一顆孤寂的心，從十分閙𤍠的人羣裏悄悄的踱了回來。</p>
<p>屋子裏是寂寞的。</p>
<p>紅的聖誕老人在望著我笑，我却感傷的哭了起來！</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>散會後。曹世光和那位姓廖的都笑嘻嘻地走上來招待他。</p>
<p>「林先生，演講得好，頂括括」。</p>
<p>「請敎？」</p>
<p>海泉紅着臉問他的姓名。</p>
<p>「廖海峯」。</p>
<p>他說着，從衣袋裏摸出一張名片來交給海泉。</p>
<p>他是本會的副牧師。</p>
<p>曹世光忙替他介紹。</p>
<p>「我們到老哈的花園裏吃茶點去吧」。</p>
<p>廖海峯伸一伸他的袖筒，表示領導他們進裏面去。</p>
<p>「不忙。讓我介紹他見見我的内人」。</p>
<p>曹世光說着走過那一頭去拉了一位女性過來。</p>
<p>「林先生，自己人，你没有見過吧？」</p>
<p>那個女人笑嘻嘻地走向着海泉行了個鞠躬禮。</p>
<p>「没有見過」。</p>
<p>她含羞般地說。</p>
<p>海泉很留心的看了看她。覺得隔遠地望她，似乎是一位美人。但是走近前來，看見她面上的凹凸的輪廓太明顯了，有點剌目，同時白粉也塗得過多了，只是表示着滿臉的凡俗。</p>
<p>簡單的茶點吃過了，海泉看看時錶近六點半了。他始終没有忘記卓淑華約他的時刻。</p>
<p>「還差一個半鐘頭」。</p>
<p>他看了一下敎會裏的情勢，知道哈巴牧師請吃晚餐的話，完全是曹世光的撒荒了。</p>
<p>「我們走吧」。</p>
<p>「好的。到那個地方去玩玩好麽？」</p>
<p>曹世光很高興般的說。</p>
<p>「有什麽地方好玩的？」</p>
<p>廖海峯反問曹世光。</p>
<p>「到那一家小館子去吃一個晚飯也好」。</p>
<p>曹世光笑着望了望海泉。但海泉懷疑他的做東道的資格。</p>
<p>「我也要去」。</p>
<p>曹夫人聽見後，撒嬌般地說。</p>
<p>「瞎鬧｜還不給我快點回去看小孩子」｜</p>
<p>「那你也一路回去，不准你一個人去享樂」！</p>
<p>她也反起臉孔來反駁她的丈夫。</p>
<h3 id="c162">偉人與「死」 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 趙家壁</p>
<p>死是生的盡頭，世上許多偉大的心靈，在向這生的世界訣别的當兒，他們從心底吐出的最後的一句話，是值得我們在這一刻裏還生存着的人去紀念的。</p>
<p>希臘人對於死的見解是看做再平淡也没有的事，人生像是一顆在生長着的樹木，瓜熟蒂落的時光，就非到另一個世界去不可了，所以死是「在快樂的一天的盡頭去睡覺」一樣的平凡。蘇格拉底臨死時，就告訴送終的人說··「我的朋友，我還欠愛斯古來伯斯一只鷄呢！」希臘的傳記家地奥格尼斯當朋友問他··「誰會來葬你的屍身呢？」他說··「誰買我的屋子，誰就得替我埋葬。」</p>
<p>在法國本來有一句俗話，呌做「没有講一句話而死」但是法國的大人物，臨死時總有一句話說出的，拉布萊說··「完了，我那雙走長路的脚帶我到這裏了。」龍沙說··「再見，我親愛的朋友，我先走一步，去預備一個位子。」至於法國大革命時代的英雄，更有許多可寳貴的遺語。</p>
<p>許多話是在斷頭台上說的，佩萊看到了斷頭台，這位革命的英雄在戰慄了，觀衆們喚着說··「你在怕死啊」。他說··「不，我覺得冷啊！」但東被刨子手拒絶，不許他去和他同時受刑的朋友擁抱時，他恨恨的說··「滾你的，你總禁止不了我們的頭顱在籃子裏接吻罷！」因爲那時用刑以後的頭顱是合放在一個籃子裏的。這些英雄的遺語，也正可以和我們中國的革莽英雄，在定上弄塲的時光，大聲的說··「再過二十年，又是一條好漢··」同樣是夠使我們佩服的。</p>
<p>在近代的許多文　人物中，有些遺語也是值得記下來的，法國詩人繆窑說··「死是多麽費事的一件事啊！」因爲他死的時光，年紀還輕，但是在他短短的一生中已受夠了愛和苦的磨折。盧校死的時光，說了這樣的話，「這是上帝，太陽喚着我！上帝開了我的胸門了。」德國詩人海湼臨死的時光，一個牧師在祈禱着上帝求「他」恕免，海湼說··「爲什麽要求呢？這是「他」的職務啊！」法國詩人唯尼臨死時對着上帝說··「要到上帝問人類請求恕免他不應當創造人類的一天，那才是最後的審判了」。</p>
<h3 id="c163">已故詩人韓蓍伯 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 平</p>
<p>韓蓍伯先生，江蘇丹徒人，幼時受業於通州張季直之門，然而他的才氣横溢，光芒四射，却與張四先生不相容。他的詩，尤其是絶詩，眞是唐宋以來所僅見的，我說還話，一定有人說我淺見，說我誇大，但是我們且看他的詩究竟怎樣。</p>
<p>弔楊仁山居士··</p>
<p>草衣捫虎坐城頭，風繞蒲團萬　秋·，爲說仁山老居士，天摇地動湼槃遊。</p>
<p>楊仁山居士是中國佛學大師，辛亥革命起，居士適在南京招邀請佛學巨子，付與衣鉢，卽歸道山，詩中云云，殆紀實也。</p>
<p>月夜登安慶城一絶··</p>
<p>一塔忽騎江水住，城陰凉月白紛紛，菱湖欲　大龍尾，片片荷花夜入雲！</p>
<p>我們就拿後一首詩做比罷。牠第一句破空而至，好似泰山飛來，擋住去路，然而却是紀實，並不是詩人的空想，其妙一·，第二句非常難接，常人想來，牠一定是雄壯慷慨的句子，才不致「佛頭着糞，」然而「城陰凉月白紛紛」這一接，又是異想天開，把一個月夜的冷靜世界，全盤收入眼底，這是多麽美麗啊！其妙二·，第三句又忽然做大勇無畏的想像，與第一句相應，第四句又入了清凉世界，飄飄欲仙，而作者的偉大的想像力與偉大的人格都在其中脫化出來了。其妙三。然而你若僅以詩人之詩如蘇曼殊之流的作品相擬，那簡直是相去天淵。蓍伯之詩，不但聲韻雄麗，且其色澤光芒，亦如登大雄寳殿，至其胞與之　與夫積極的精神，更屬並世無兩，唐宋以來的絶詩，大都注全力於後兩句，而老韓之詩，一開始便是龍騰虎拿，字字墮地作金石聲，此我之所以珍重介紹者也。</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>作者還要勸舊醫先生們。即使覺悟。千萬要從新。而萬不要標新。現在頗有一部份舊醫先生說。舊醫學。已經由舊醫自己在那裏用科學方法整理。呌作什麽現代醫學「科學化」。這種沐猴而冠的方法决不是學問之成功並且「我們舊醫。你們新醫」。的門户觀念太深。所以我要勸舊醫先生們如果閣下的自己對科學眞正了解以後。來整理舊醫藥。那麽閣下也就是一個新醫了。我們當然十分歡迎。如果閣下鑑於潮流趨向。呌你們令郎習了科學。那麽令郎就是新醫了。於是舊醫藥自然而然用科學方法整理。與現在新醫整理舊醫藥的趨向一般無二。如嫌醫界太多好麽以後我的小犬。只讓他學旁的學問。决不有絲毫傳統的衣食觀念。而必須以醫世其家的。我嘗比喻說。銅壼滴漏和自鳴鐘。同是計時刻的東西。與新舊醫同是治病的目標相同。不過時代上嫌銅壼漏滴已經太不準確了。。所以必須用鐘表。何以只許銅壼滴漏的舖子裏。把壷漏裝上玻璃框子。冒稱鐘表。而不許鐘表廠裏的工程師。到銅壼滴漏舖中去取材造鐘呢。可見得爲適應潮流而造銅鐘表。才是公的。爲要保持舖子而只造銅壼滴漏未免是私的了。現在許多舊醫先生作的文字。已經承認細菌解剖諸學不可磨滅。並且用Ｘ光察視臟腑。已列入診斷之學。這是新醫大聲疾呼的效果。也是舊醫從善如流的可敬。可是說到後來。往往又說什麽「分經辨絡」。用「想像印像」以斷病。漸漸地又入玄學了。這種情形。不是舊醫界特性。乃是我國敎育的本身。没有拿自然科學打切實　抵之故。人們利用汽車代步。却没有知道淺顯的物理。如何怪他。</p>

<p>㈡圓周内另畫之小圓形乃表示一種結合。而箭頭表示來源與方向。</p>

<p>㈣國中以角度分門别類表示各種醫藥業務之大小。而以半徑表示其器械之設備。經濟與學術之並進　但皆係一種約計並非精密之比例。茲將各種醫藥分述如后。</p>
<p>（甲）新醫界　約占全部四分之一。而實際恐猶不及此數。其中雖分各項系統。然而都因學校書籍文字上的分别。其學說靡不相同。其人材與科目亦靡不具備。故而社會上誤稱新醫有英美德日等派。則新醫不能承認。至各系的醫院設備。各系的學府規模。容或因經濟關係略有參差而已。惟圖中所畫僅以示意。並非確有計算。然後下筆。讀者諒之。</p>
<p>醫師公會雖成立於此項新醫界。而亦有一部份人尙未入會者。有人戲謂醫師公會胡不仿照律師公會例。凡不入會者不得應診。其意至善。然而非所以語今日醫師法令不全。混沌醫藥尙未肅清之時也。况律師執業。乃多數律師出庭於當地一二法院。而醫師應診乃少數醫師診治千萬病家。一正一反。不易取締乎。此外則上海有外國醫師多人。及外國醫院多處。與醫師公會絶不相干。（故圖示實線）彼輩經費充裕。代價特昂。而設備絶精。然而祇供少數資本家及貴族與外國人專用。去平民愈遠。其業務與我上海一般市民關係絶少。</p>
<p>（乙）舊醫界　眞舊醫界大别可分爲三類。其一爲眞正傳統式之舊醫。如某某夫子授某某門人之類。而其一則爲近年來新發生之中醫學校畢業生。此二種舊醫之業務。亦不過佔全部醫療四分之一。而盛名之下之舊醫人數尤少。至中央國醫館則爲此中之一團體。頗思推進其已經退化之學說者也。然而玄學研究。限於古籍。似未易進步。勢必夾雜科學之皮毛。而成所謂「試爲溝通之新舊醫術」。决非眞正玄學科學一貫相通之醫學也。</p>
<p>（丙）混沌醫界　此項醫藥與一般民衆最爲接近。約計之當佔全部醫療事業之半。表面似爲經濟而平民化。其實乃吸收平民之金錢。其份子亦最複雜。如新醫醫院之院役看護。以及不容於正式新醫全市大多數居民龍罩栏混沌窗葯之下而並不能節省其經濟者何止百萬人</p>
<p>之敗類。藉以投機貿利者。次則舊醫中之自稱儒理方脈。自謂無師自通者。旣於舊醫界無立足點。遂流入此混沌界以謀衣食。再則少數中醫學校之畢業生。因受新學說之皮毛。略知生理解剖。略識横行文字。偶用西藥。爲人注射一二皮下針。即欄入西醫公會。以售其不新不舊之技者皆是也。</p>
<p>西醫公會之份子。吾人至今不能斷其爲有一種標準。其造成此會。實由於法令之反響。該會最初份子。固不乏技術尙佳。執業多年之看護生。或則各院之所謂實習生等人。然其入會資格無依據。（圖以虚線表示。作者嘗以其會員錄爲證。皆不標明出身。）而又處於混沌醫藥界之中。久而久之。内容尤雜矣。（一切詳醫政篇。</p>
<p>此外等而下之。則推大車與人注射九一四者。蓋布棚爲人治牙者。以神權爲人開方者曰三老爺。陳太爺。辰州符。祝由科之類。更無論矣。旣有此混沌之醫藥界。用醫藥頭銜爲庇護。於是外界任何人可以加入謀生。如流氓。巫祝。藥店小夥。俄國浪人。印度眼科等不一而足。中西僞藥亦即肆無忌憚。斯眞洋洋奇觀。而中央主宰者之目光。固猶在迷離惝恍間也。（未完）</p>

<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>第一章　心理槪論</p>
<p>第一節　研究之方法</p>
<p>病情隨年齡，性别，性情，環境而異其變化，異其預後，異其治療，病人之心理亦隨年齡，性别，性情，環境而異其趨向，醫者當善爲觀察而異其待遇。故善能分析病人之心理者，謂之良醫。蓋必其具精細之頭腦，機警之手腕，然後始可臨機致變，應付裕如。昆蟲能避免前途之危險，恃其觸鬚，人類能解决一切之困難，恃其靈敏之觀察，夫所謂精細，機警雖受之於遺傳，亦可謂之於訓練。不能分析人之心理者，不能爲醫而開業後，必受精神與經濟上之損失，如於醫學果有特殊之興味，亦祇能置身試騐室中，而不能設診也，</p>
<p>欲知病人之心理，非表同情，示好感於病人不可，務使病人於醫生前，能盡量傾吐其胸肌。然後病家之心理，醫家乃可洞悉，雖然，病人之言，亦未可盡信，更須留心於其舉動，及其談吐之態度，面目之神形，參互研究，然後所分析之心理，始能歸予確實。</p>
<p>學生於醫院實習時，能注意上述之工作者，將來必爲良醫，無可疑也。</p>
<p>第二節　㈠醫生與病人意見之鑿柄及其救濟之方法</p>
<p>醫生與病人意見鑿柄之處，約有四點··</p>
<p>㈠地位之殊異　醫病兩方之地位，每有貴族化與平民化之分。貴族化出身之醫生，爲平民診病，不難於平民化也，如平民化出身之醫生，一旦爲貴族化之病人診病，則每致失其常態，此則於學校時期，即須練習儀表言詞，以求免於庸俗，而具學者風度。總之適應環境，爲行道之要訣，祇可以醫生屈就病人，而不可使病人屈就醫生也。</p>
<p>㈡思想之抵觸　病人與醫生每談及治社會等問題，因雙方思想之不同，而發生衝突者有之。唯一之救濟方法，即在關於診病以外之問題，一槪不談可也。即病人侃侃而言，而醫家亦祇可以唯唯否否之態度對之，不當與之辨論。蓋醫者當視病人爲病人，則其所云云，自無與之衝突之必要。</p>
<p>㈢言語之隔閡　一地有一地之方言，醫生與病人每因言語之隔閡，而發生困難，故醫生於某地開業，必先練習某地之通行語言。又病人之程度不同，醫者於言語之際，尤需隨病人之文野而定其雅俗。</p>
<p>㈣信仰之不同　有略識醫理之病人，於醫生之處方用藥，妄加辨論者。亦</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>有頭腦固執之病人，於新醫前，表示崇拜中醫者，斯皆謂之信仰不同。醫者於此，唯有善爲開導，不可極端排斥之也。（未完）</p>

<p>— 愚公</p>
<p>㈤光線治療　太陽光及超紫光之療肺癆。錠之治惡性腫瘤。成效卓著。在各種治療法中。占重要位置。術極專門。非淺甞者所能悉其奥𥨆。</p>
<p>㈥精神治療　若干疾病。出於環境不佳。以致抑　寡歡。精神頽敗。昔日有一婦人。哺乳嬰孩。乳汗稀少。求治於醫。醫者察其憂形於色。因問其家庭歷史。知失和於姑。因勸之分居。不久乳汁即增。嬰孩之體重亦加。是精神上之慰藉。遠勝於藥。如上述病症。苟乞靈於藥。不能見效。可斷言也。</p>
<p>上述各法。苟欲其運用適宜。非有充分之學力。嫺習之技能。豐富之經騐。及相當之設備不可。故往往醫師一人之力量不足。轉商他醫。或門診處之設備不夠。將病人送入殹院。若病即服藥。除藥非醫。醫學决不若是之簡單也。况所謂特效藥者。如鷄納之於瘧疾。六０六之於梅毒。及血清之於白喉。爲數寥寥。其他藥物。只能治病狀。不能治病因。病狀解除。不能謂病源已去。譬之患扁桃體炎者。用「阿細斐耐替汀」。解除頭痛。不能謂「阿細斐耐替汀」。乃治扁桃體炎之特效藥也。患白喉者。每痛不能眠。可用「嗎啡」或「可的因」鎭靜之。不能謂「嗎啡」或「可的因」乃白喉之特效藥也。患麻疹者。用「安息香」蒸氣以止咳嗽。不能謂「安息香」乃麻疹之特效藥也。患肺癆者。用「阿刀平」以止盜汗。用「稀鹽酸」或「龍膽侵酒」以開胃口。不能謂[稀監酸]或[龍膽浸酒]乃肺癆之特效藥也。患腎臟炎者。用「疋羅卡平」以發汗。「硫酸鎂」以瀉腹。不能謂「疋羅卡平」或「硫酸鎂」乃腎臟炎之特效藥也。凡此種種。皆用藥以治病狀。然病狀之解除。用「非藥方法」亦有異曲同工之妙。故病人就醫。愼勿以藥爲唯一治病之武器可也。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>㈠腥紅𤍠�</p>
<p>問　什麼呌做腥紅𤍠。</p>
<p>答　腥紅𤍠是一種很強的傳染病，俗王稱爛喉痧，</p>
<p>問　腥紅𤍠的病原是什麼，</p>
<p>答　近來發見腥紅𤍠是因爲一種鏈狀球菌的傳染而起的，這種球菌，呌做溶血性鏈狀球菌，（HaemsyticStrepococcus)</p>
<p>問　這種病原菌，怎樣侵入人體的，</p>
<p>答　從鼻道和咽頭部的粘膜或扁桃脈，咽頭淋巴脈，侵入，也有從皮膚的外傳口侵入的，</p>
<p>問　這種病，在什麽年紀時最容易被傳染，</p>
<p>答　在二歲到十歲的小兒最多，乳兒和成人較小，</p>
<p>問　腥紅𤍠病菌傳染之後，經幾纔發病，</p>
<p>答　經三天到六天的潛伏期，纔發病變，</p>
<p>問　發病的起初，身體覺得怎樣，</p>
<p>答　起初覺得惡寒戰慄，體温很急的上昇，也有嘔吐和痙攣的，不久，就起頸部病，嚥下困難，扁桃脈和軟腭發亦腫脹，</p>
<p>問　後來怎樣，</p>
<p>答　後來，就在第二天的時候，頸部和胸上部的地方，發出紅疹，經三四天達極度，漸漸波及軀幹和四肢，但面部的發疹很少，口唇的周圍，是絶對不發紅疹的，所以反呈蒼白色，</p>
<p>問　這種發疹，大小和形狀怎樣，</p>
<p>答　每顆疹子像别針的頭這樣大小，起初是一顆一顆的淡紅生，還能看出皮　面，對後來發出會多，混成一片，變成深紅色，所以有腥紅𤍠的名稱，</p>
<p>問　發𤍠到第幾天，可以退去，</p>
<p>答　到第十天，可以回復平温，</p>
<p>問　腥紅𤍠病人的舌面，是怎樣的，</p>
<p>答　舌面粘膜剥落，也呈腥紅色，粗糙，很像楊梅顆粒，也像貓舌，</p>
<p>問　發腥紅𤍠的人，爲什麽大都兼患爛喉，</p>
<p>答　因爲咽頭合併發生咽頭炎而致糜爛之故，</p>
<p>問　患腥紅𤍠的時候，還有合併什麽病症嗎，</p>
<p>答　量多的是合併腎臟炎，病人的尿中合有蛋白質，體温又昇高起來，面部發浮腫，全身水腫，腹水，尿量减少，混有血液，終則發尿毒症，非常危險，</p>
<p>問　心臟有發合併症嗎，</p>
<p>答　也有的，像心内膜炎，心肌炎，心囊炎，頻數脈搏等，</p>
<p>問　病後皮膚怎樣恢復原狀，</p>
<p>答　發腥紅𤍠疹的皮膚，要脫皮，這種脫皮成一大塊落下的，</p>
<p>問　腥紅𤍠病人，應當怎樣療治，</p>
<p>答　應當安靜臥牀，病室中要温暖濕潤，食物要吃流動性，口内常用過養化輕水嗽口，注射强心劑服用利尿劑，口渴時給與牛奶，腥紅𤍠血清注射，也很有效，</p>

<p>不抵抗不能生存</p>
<p>吾人四周。病菌環伺。待隙而動。欲圖擴張其生命綫。吾人有皮膚等之城廓。有淋巴腺等之溝池。有白血球等之戰士·相與抵抗。以圖自存。而吾人之生命綫即呼吸飮食如呼吸器消化器之不能不與外界相交通。以吸收營養者。當然又有相當之設備。以防其偷渡暗襲。故病菌之由呼吸器侵襲者。發喷嚏。咳嗽。咯痰。以驅逐之·若由消化器侵襲者。發嘔吐。瀉泄。以驅逐之。此乃天賦之抵抗機能。亦即人類生存之要素也。</p>
<p>吾人之失於調護者。病菌乘虚嚴入。佔據要津。奪取營養。於是發生戰鬥之現象。即所謂疾病。如發𤍠等症狀。不失爲發揮抵抗力之象徵也。抵抗之力不足。則體力日衰。而病菌猖獗。病益增劇。抵抗勝利。則病菌死滅。而病體恢復。故病有不藥而愈者。醫學上稱之曰自然治愈機能。良醫之治病也。主以營養及等於武器之藥物。供給病人。以扶植其抵抗力。若有摧殘其自然治愈機能。即抑制其抵抗作用者。不啻助長病菌。此即所謂庸醫殺人。</p>

<p>— 天方</p>
<p>讀本報本月二十日東京南京兩專電使我這個宗敎的叛徒，深深感到佛法的無邊，現在且把這兩個專電照錄如下，</p>
<p>中央社十九日南京電班禪十九日午假華僑招待所宴記者，班禪致詞，略謂，余離藏已將十載，康藏糾紛，幸告一段落。余始終抱和平宗旨，往來蒙古及内地，宣傳德意，欲以宗敎慈悲，補政治所不及。有謂余將藉武力回藏，實則無此心，亦無此力。切望藏人輸誠中央，以紓西顧之憂云云。又電通社十九日東京電··因破産問題解决不久復歸宗籍之東本願寺法主大谷光演師，决以布敎謀日滿之親善而渡滿。於一兩日前到京已得軍部與外務當局之諒解，預定一月上旬實現。關於此東本願寺當局語人日前法主爲融和日滿而渡滿，爲非常佳事，即本派目下正努力開放滿洲，故非常歡迎。好兩個慈悲爲懷的和尙，其行事雖有不同，然而都願以宗敎補政治之所不及則並無不同。祇是東洋和尙的「宣傳德意」，似比國産和尙只行之於國内，而還蒙着借用「武力之嫌」的來得勇猛，來得精進。這於産地大有關係。本來「懶惰聖人」多産於𤍠帶的印度，原因是𤍠帶地方，謀食容易，一般人　食終日，無所事事，於是常以幻想自娛，儘管天有三十三天，地有十八層地獄，等等瞎嚼咀，使天文地質學家聞而咋舌，但一逾國界，便起化學作用，到中國與黃老相合，到日本便帶足「武士道」的氣味。雖然我們的「護國ＸＸ大師」｜全銜記不清楚了。｜也曾祈禱和平，綿延國運，但要施法於槍砲之前，似乎未及東洋和尙行之於槍砲之後來得有效。雖說日本佛法自中國傳去，但這點，却「青出於藍」了，我們的「國師」未免有點愧色。以上所說，都是廢話，我獨贊嘆「佛法無邊有求必應」，「侵略」與「抵抗」一手作賬，事情未免有點滑稽，讀楞嚴謂『一切衆生，如百蚊蚋，聚一器中，鼓發狂閙，』我佛有靈，其亦懊悔生前嚼舌，死後｜佛說「湼槃」｜徒作人間傀儡，要聲明本不干我事吧</p>
<p>勘誤　前天本刋談言「答毅會君的幾句話」中一切文學多好爲什麽好？是新詎知新字被工友脫去未曾校出以致祇有問句而無答語幾至不成文理特此補正</p>

<h3 id="c173">好厲害的綠氣 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 冷梅</p>
<p>一提到「綠氣」，我想大家會這樣地嘘出一口氣來說··「好厲害的傢伙」｜的確，它是一種劇毒的氣體，吸其少量，已能使人發生不愉快的感覺，若吸之過多，那末，就要上鬼名簿去掛號了。</p>
<p>在世界大戰的時候，所用的毒瓦斯砲，以及各種毒氣彈，是皆含有綠氣，這種無人道的戰器，不知有多少人在這上犧牲了生命｜至今｜它那厲害，慘毒的影象，尙深印在吾人的腦際。</p>
<p>綠氣之所以有劇毒的原因，恐怕是因爲吸入後與肺中的水份相化合而成鹽酸，而這鹽酸足可腐蝕肺臟，至使呼吸停止而死。</p>
<p>綠氣是一種黃綠色的氣體，有剌激喉鼻的奇臭，且有劇毒，較之空氣約重二倍有半，在平常温高及壓力之下，一體積的清水可溶二體積半的綠氣，其涪液稱爲氣水。</p>
<p>在自然界裏，汲有游離的氣原案，因爲它的活動力極强，易與他種原素化合，所以它的化合物在地面上産生的很多，說來也很希奇，我們日常不可缺少的食鹽，却係劇毒的綠氣與鈉的化合物。（化學上謂之氣化鈉SodiumChloride)說句笑話，如將上面二種東西給人吃起來，恐怕誰也承受不了，可是我們的小菜中如缺少了食鹽，那恐怕一定要大發脾氣呢｜</p>
<p>綠氣果然是一種毒物，但是它的用途却很煩廣，它具有强有力的漂白作用，濕潤之色布，若與此氣相遇，則即褪色，如用乾燥之色布，則無變化發生，由此可知，綠氣的漂白作用並非直接的，因　能先使水分解，發生養氣，此種新生氣活動力極强與色質相遇，即起氧化作用而使之褪色，又綠氣具有顯著之殺菌力，故可用作消毒劑，氯供以上二項目的之用者爲量極廣，因爲携帶不便，所以在工業上多製成漂白粉Bleachingpowder以供使用。</p>
<p>氣之用途頗廣，故在工業上製造多量之氯時，皆直接由其化合中製取之。茲述數則如下·，</p>
<p>電解食鹽法ElectrolysisPrccess</p>
<p>以電流通過食鹽，氣化鉀或鹽酸之溶液，則此等　化物即被分解，綠氣由陽極放出。</p>
<p>2NaCl＋H2O＝2NaOH＋H2＋Cl2</p>
<p>第根製氯法Deaconsprocess</p>
<p>加大𤍠於鹽酸，使與空中之氧相化合，即有一部分之綠氣放出。</p>
<p>4HCl＋O2＝2H2O＋2Cl2</p>
<p>但此法須用一種氯化物如二氯化銅ＣuCl2以作觸媒，始起變化，因爲如以二氯化銅强𤍠之，則即變爲二氣化二銅Cu2Cl2而放出一部分之氯。2CuCl2＝Cu2Cl2＋Cl2</p>
<p>同時，二氯化二銅與氧相遇，則變爲一氧二氯化二銅Cu2OCl2</p>
<p>2Cu2Cl2＋O2＋2Cu2ocL2</p>
<p>此一氧二氯化二銅與鹽酸起作用，復變爲二氯化銅及水Cu2OCl2＋2HCl＋2CuCl2＋H2O</p>
<p>如此即成一循環作用，以少量之二氯化銅可繼續之不竭。</p>
<p>柏衛二氏法PechineyWeldonprocess</p>
<p>此法在工業上頗有價值，</p>
<p>用氯化鎂MgO與氯化鎂MgCl2之溶液加大𤍠，即變爲一氧二氯化二鎂Mg2ICl2，再𤍠之，即成鹽酸及氯。鹽酸中之氫從水中分出，</p>
<p>氯則由空氣中之氧置換氯化鎂中之氯而來。此二種混合之氣體，可通過水中以除去鹽酸，則氯即放出，此中氧化鎂不受變化，仍可繼續使用。</p>
<p>在實騐室中製氯時，最普通之法，用二氧化錳與濃鹽酸一同加𤍠，即有綠氣放出。</p>
<p>MnO2＋4HCl＝MnCl2＋H2O＋Cl2</p>
<p>或以稀鹽酸加入漂白粉中caocl2中，不用加𤍠，即有綠氣放出。</p>
<p>CaOCl2＋2HCl＝H2O＋CaCl2＋</p>
<p>Cl2</p>
<p>氣能直接與各種金屬化合，如鈉及涕等。（此種金屬能燃燒於綠氣中，而直接與之化合成氣化物，）2Na＋Cl2＝　　2NaCl</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>遠在哈巴狗兒𤍠得伸出舌頭的時候，我因爲受不住南京蟲（日人的臭蟲之謂也）的侵擾，便舉遷避到這野草荒蕪的鄕村中來了。我住的是新造的房屋，當然，這裏没有南京蟲的窠巢，於是我不禁以手加額，慶祝天下太平。</p>
<p>這裏是建築未久的新莊，在不久以前的一次大火之後，這裏的一切，俱化灰燼，均待重新建設，没有自來水，没有瓦斯，也没有電燈。於是我們貧賤夫妻親自動手，掘井泉以代自來水，割野</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>草以代瓦斯，燃石油以代電燈了。</p>
<p>我們貧弱得可憐，我們自愧缺乏建設能力，但是我們却也怡然自得，因爲我們可以從此平安的生活下去。夫復何求？</p>
<p>在深夜，我憑桌讀書，每當石油將盡燈光顯得微弱的時候，於是我閉目靜思·仰靠着椅背，雙手放在膝踝上，譏自己溶侵在陰暗的死空氣中。</p>
<p>昨晚偶然來了兩個朋友，一個是西裝整潔，風雅翩翩，一個是長袍大袖，胸襟上還洒着幾塊油漬。可是我對他們一樣恭而敬之，親手在白金龍的烟筒裏拿出仙女牌來奉上，還躬着腰爲他們劃着火柴。因爲我深深的引爲榮幸，在如此簡陋的居室中居然能邀得友人的光降。</p>
<p>但是我却擔心友人會不滿意我這暗昏昏的石油燈，因爲這多少對於他們有點不合脾胃。果然，西裝朋友開口了··　　「你爲什麽搬到這連電燈也没有的地方來呢？」</p>
<p>「呃······」我侷不安了。</p>
<p>「這是多麽氣悶呀」</p>
<p>「呃」，我只能這樣的憋着。敎我還能說什麽呢？</p>
<p>「不過這也没有關係，」另一友人開口了，我知道略有轉機，我得救了。</p>
<p>「這有什麽關係呢？」他再重覆着說··「只要看得見就得了。爲什麽一定得有電燈呢？」</p>
<p>「不過······」西裝朋友還要說話，可是我因爲那天開水喝得太多，恰好忍漲不住，便跑到屋後小便去了。回來時便不再聽着他們談着關於石油燈的事了。眞的，我得救了。</p>

<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>······亭子間隨筆······</p>
<p>請坐　大凡呐喊人道主義者，視坐黃包車是一件最不人道的事，果然，人拖人，坐的寫意煞，拖的苦辣煞。但我想在現社會裏·旣有這制度的存留，與其戴了人道幌子而不坐，使他們無以爲生，倒不如揭開面具，壓下良心，量力而坐，使他們每日也能撈到半升米飽肚皮。話說滬寗鐵路每晚十一時例有一班快車駛進北站，在七八點鐘的時候，四處的黃包車便都麕集到了站的附近。有一晚上已是十一點多了，我從朋友家裏回去，經過界路，眼見許多的車子還擺在路的兩旁，顯然證明這次的快車脫了班。他們的呵欠聲，嘘氣聲，嘆息聲，融成一片，漁火似的油燈，好像都在對他們的主人｜車夫慘笑，我正縮瑟瑟地在走，　地裏右邊擠出一部車子，那車夫長長地向我作個揖，而且哀求地說··「請坐，隨儂給幾個銅板，火車脫班了，半天還不見粥水」！說着他竟涙眼汪汪地跪下了，當時我眞被窘得走也不是，站也不是，慌張地把衣褲袋裏摸索，給了他僅有約五個銅板說··「我也是没有辦法，雖然樣子似乎比你好」！我走了，一路上耳邊似乎還有聲浪··「請坐，隨儂給幾個銅板······」！</p>
<p>名敎授的話　當九一八事變爆發以後，滬上有一位名敎授在ＸＸ雜誌上發表言論曰··「日本人眞不自量，要知道我們中國有進樣大，喪失了東北，依然還是個大國，還可以自强。」這確是名敎授的千古名論，中國果然不小，從前即有二十一行省，現在更加劃了好幾省。只是我想大雖大，也不過是幾塊東北那樣大的土地湊合而成，若如名敎授說來，東北失去，依然還是個大國，那末，再失去𤍠河，平津，也還是大國，甚至連本部十八省全都送掉，四萬萬同胞都遷到葱嶺去，那也還不小。唉，我們的名敎授，我們的名敎授的千古名論！</p>
<p>妙對　ＸＸ學院的門口近來發現這樣一首妙對··</p>
<p>敎育敎育</p>
<p>學生學生</p>
<p>是的，我們很知道，ＸＸ學院是配稱得「野鷄」二字的學府，由幾位失意政客做撑脚（校董），由一位得意政客做院長，更由幾位窮途的四五等官僚充敎授，更有一羣羣的官僚子孫滿載着平民血汗染化的金錢去做角色｜學生，於是學府儼然像學府了。關於「戀愛」一道，聽說確有成績，敎授倡導於上，學生效倣於下，於是「愛」的氛圍，便充滿了整個學府，恰恰應到了門口頭的那首妙對。我只深深地嘆惜，若是他們所充所生出來，子孫，依然像老種，則中國一切官僚化的局勢，大有永續的希望，嗟乎粲者｜</p>

<p>— 禹成</p>
<p>阿根在上海做了幾年的生意，好像剥了一層皮，態度和從前完全兩樣·，一套半新的嗶嘰西裝，一雙擦得漆亮的皮鞋，花條布的襯衫，紅花緞的領帶，直嚇壞而且羨煞了他故鄕裏一切黃泥腿的人們。</p>
<p>「上海聽說是神仙的境界，究竟是什麽樣的情形？」他回到家裏，鄰友親戚都一齊聚集來了，一個個懷著求知和好奇的心理，同來追問剛從仙地歸來的阿根。</p>
<p>「······」他將上海的繁盛說得天花亂墜，加倍過火，直把一班鄕下人仰慕極了·，尤其是阿根的父親還嘆了一口氣道··「我今生如能夠到上海去一趟，死也閉眼了！唉，没福！」</p>
<p>「爹爹說那裏說？停幾日隨我一道去好了！」阿根忽然孝心發現，就毅然地這樣允承。於是過了幾天，他父子倆便一同就道。</p>
<p>路程中阿根父只在猜想著上海的情狀，想到决樂時頰旁不禁浮現出笑容·，但阿根却非常地敗興，懊恨著不該帶父親同來，因爲他父親仍舊穿著破壞的棉襖，補掇處已重疊得好似寳塔的模樣，　際　到上海被人恥笑，丢落他虚僞的排塲··但也無可奈何，只常常在輕輕嘆息。</p>
<p>抵到上海，就往各處遨游·，阿根的朋　見了他同來的土𧈢蜡兒，兀自十二分地疑惑，便悄悄地探問他道··「那是你的什麽人？窮像！」</p>
<p>阿根眞有點爲難了，想了幾想，還算他聰明而機警，便掩飾著答道··「只因他的媳婦和我相好，所以帶他同來白相的。」</p>
<p>這幾句話語將他朋輩說得愈加疑惑起來了，於是背著阿根向那土𧈢蜡兒打趣道··「瞧不起你這土老，家裏還有一朶鮮花呢！」</p>
<p>「這話從何說起？我不明白！」</p>
<p>「還要裝羊！你媳婦居然和阿根哥相好，你難道不曉得嗎？」</p>
<p>「哦，你們諸位只知其一，不知其二··你們僅知道我的媳婦和他相好，你們還不曉得他的母親陪我睡覺呢！」</p>
<p>「······」</p>
<p>「·························」</p>
<p>這一番話不知怎樣竟被阿根聽見了，他知道誑語已經拆穿，只得具實以告。像這種奇怪的現象在如今畸形的社會裏只怕是層出不窮，闊綽的生人也許可以認作父母叔伯，否則雖係自身的爺娘，也推作陌生的路人一樣！</p>

<p>因此，我時常在打算·，雖然我不是一個革命偉人，也不是一個名震全國的頂兒，尖兒，但是在一般智識階級的心目中，對於我至少還有幾分認識·，如其我能夠慷慨地抛下了我所有的一切，擯棄了眼前的一切物質上的享受，而單身出走，上東三省去加入義勇軍的話，報紙上少不得要有幾篇極醒目的記載。（他們是不會知道我的眞正的用意的！）或者這樣也可以喚起幾許人的覺悟，更由這先覺悟的幾許人去警醒其餘，這才不枉我老子撫養了我二十五年</p>
<p>爲着我的心愛的人而犧牲自己的念頭，旣已决定，犧牲的方法，我便挑中了這一種·，所謂一舉兩得，雖不能說是「死有重於泰山」，至少也不輕如南京的紫金山了！</p>
<p>所要說的話似乎是全說完了！滑稽可笑的也有，慷慨激昂的也有，想不到我｜朱近赤｜在臨死之前，還有這麽一篇大文章留下呢！</p>

<p>方才我不是賭過一句很滑稽的咒嗎？我說··「十年之内，中國不亡，來生我願意變成一頭烏龜。」這話原是說着笑的。我當然不願意讓我們的大中華民國在十年之内，果眞滅亡掉，我當然也不願意來生眞去投胎，做一只遺臭萬年的小烏龜··不過我對於來生的趨向，却大可極坦白，極眞誠地說給你聽聽。雖然，所謂來生也者，根本上還是一件虚無漂渺的事情咧！</p>
<p>記得我最後一次見到你的時候，你的肚子似乎已比尋常高了幾分，再把以前幾天的情形來引證之下，你和大經的第二次的結晶品，顯然是已在製造之中了。我更預計我自已前程九月底出關，十月中到達目的地；依我這樣的體格和作戰的經騐而論，大槪至多在明年的勞働以前免不掉要名登國殤之列了。那末待到你肚子裏的小動物長得成了形，準備出世的當兒，我儘可以趕得及，把我的靈魂鑽入他成她的軀壳中來了。</p>
<p>如其這樣的事情果然可以實現，那我這一死，眞比神仙屍解以後昇天得道還快活了！美麗的小猪玀！我但願做你的兒子，做你的女兒，整天儇在你的懷抱裏，永遠不讓你離開我！我一定比王祥老萊子們更孝順！我不要一個小朋友，我不要情人，我不願意娶妻子，或是出嫁，我祇希望終身隨侍着你這位小朋友！但是，請你記着··你千萬不要讓大經給我雇乳母，否則我寗願依舊餓死！</p>
<p>哈哈！廢話倒又說了一長篇。此刻車子，已過了唐官屯，馬上要到天津了。到天津，我便把這封信交給郵務局，預料寄到你跟前的時候，大槪是在五天之後。</p>
<p>這一封信的封面上，寫得很神秘，除非大經有袖裏陰陽，他是决不會知道的·，不過你如其願意讓他瞧瞧，也是不妨的。或者還可以使他從此放下了一顆心。</p>
<p>完了！一切是完了｜祝你</p>

<p>土木工程。由申泰興記營造廠承包。其餘煖汽衛生電線鋼牕電梯各種工程。均爲滬上著名廠家承造。於去年五月正式開工。預定來年正月。即可完竣。嗣因滬戰影響。約至五月始能完成。總價共一百餘萬兩。</p>

<p>樓共十層。前面高一百十五英尺。屋頂另闢餘房。爲銀行職員俱樂部。其地窨樓下及假二樓歸銀行自用。保險庫及機器間佔地窨之大部。而最新式之保險箱。則置於假二樓。</p>
<p>所有庫門保險箱均由美國（Mosler）公司特别計畫安裝。置有機器。能於辦公時後。雖庫内發生最細微聲音或音浪。均可報警。全樓更密布警鐘。以資防護。而於保險箱保衛尤爲周全。</p>
<p>樓上共有樓面七層。備代出租。面積共計五十三萬方尺。每房光線異常充足。各能從走郎直達房間。但欲分間亦甚適易。房間多爲兩面開牕。使得空氣流通。每層安置水汀煖氣。及新式衛生設備。而每房更留備各種電線電話線。以備房客與外線連接。</p>
<p>全樓置最新式沃的斯電梯兩乘。速率每分鐘能升五百尺高。而各層上下地位寛闊。縱房客上落雖多。亦絶不致有擠擁之虞。</p>
<p>現據建築師觀察。樓上部份。約於來年二月中旬可以租用。銀行部份。則因雲石古銅及内部裝飾稍費時日。約比樓上略遲三個月即可完成也。</p>

<p>美國二十五尺長。十二寸方尺之松木。每椿周圍距離爲三尺六寸。占全部建築費幾及三分之一。故地盤甚爲結實。在普通貨棧中。可謂首屈一指。故貨物保險。亦照最低率計算。每層高度第一層。爲十七尺半。第二層爲十二尺半。三層以上均爲十二尺。前後均用鋼窗流通空氣。係採取歐美最新式樣。并聞該棧職員。對於堆存貨物。具有科學經騐。所有各種貨物之裝置。及其性質與夫氣候關係。均能辨别入微。由分類適當之處置。至堆存該棧貨物。可隨時向該行國立青島大學建造科學館工程進行時攝影由申泰興記營造廠承造</p>

<p>上海是成爲現代中國首屈一指的大　。　　的貿易。工商業的繁盛。也在世界大都市中。占了第六位。這是大家所　　　　不過我們細細的一加考察。雖則看到上海的區域是這樣的遼闊。但是　　　　繁盛的中心地。方圓恐怕也不過只有幾里罷。試想在這點僅僅幾里方圓　　　地域。要聚集無數中外新舊的工商業。事實上是然很湧擠緊凑。難乎其難了。所以他排我擠。甚至你占我奪。那力量比較得雄厚點的。還免强可以獲得寸尺之地。那力量薄弱的。那末只得被排擯在市外了。現在有多少的大工廠大商店。因爲得不到一個中心地位。來陳列樣品。或是營業所。退而取其次。因此事業不能發展。到後來失敗。甚至虧蝕。看來眞可痛惜。那裏是他們資本不厚，人才不優，出品不良的原故呢？</p>
<p>成功一個繁盛的中心市區。也是絶對不能以一朝一夕。一人一力。可以做得到的。他有他的形勢和歷史。那末上海的繁盛中心。旣是這樣的陜遏。所以要想救　這個緊急的需要。就不得不想個特殊的方法了。上海大陸銀行信託部。他以服務社會的職志。和補助工商業的使命。他鏖到了這個的重大缺憾。尤其是我國落後的工商業。所感受到的痛苦。更爲深刻。所以非馬上的來解决不可。於是就有這大陸商場創辦的動議。其間經過了很久的研究和討論。就覺得選擇塲址。最爲困難。後來終以上海現代商務的情形。和將來發展的趨勢。就勘定了北臨南京路。東臨山東路。南臨九江路。西臨又新街的一方大地。爲建造商塲的塲址。至於這個地位的優越。形勢的重要。和交通的便利。的確是在上海繁盛中心地内。可算數一數二的了。他東面距離黃浦是十分接近。西面又緊接着畫錦里（山西路）日升樓（浙江路）一帶。南面從法租界來。又不遠。北面到火車站虹口去。又極方便。所以成爲一個全市的衝衢。貿易的途隘。而且面積的容量也很大。足有九畝多地。有了這個的大好區處。來建築一所偉大輝煌的商塲。是再也適合没有了。不過地主。雖是哈同洋行。但是大陸信託部早已具了遠大的計劃。已經訂好了很久的租約（三十二年）。</p>
<p>正在建築中之大陸大樓由基泰建築工程司設計申泰興記營造廠承造</p>
<p>莊俊建築師設計</p>
<p>公記營造廠承造</p>
<p>大陸信託部勘定了塲址以後。就在民國二十年春。交付上海著名建築師莊俊先生設計打樣。莊先生就參考了世界各國最新的計劃作爲標準。再補充以現代的需要。和我國的習慣。本來莊先生有了很深的經騐。就很迅速的計劃完成這個偉大建築。同時就由本埠公記營造廠以規元七十餘萬兩的造價得標承造。在同年三月十九日就行開工大吉的典禮了。本來預定是七個半月可以全部交屋。但是不幸的滬戰爆發。因而中間停頓了幾個月。後來等到恊定簽字。社會恢復了原有狀態之後。公記營造廠趕即完成他未竣的建築。到今年的國慶時候。於是這所上海破天荒的大商塲。方得與我們相見。再看興建這樣一所大厦。其間總合只需要僅短短幾個月的工夫。眞是不得不欽佩公記營造廠力量的偉大與神速</p>
<p>房屋大槪與</p>
<p>飯店弄堂之今昔</p>
<p>查公共租界工部局工務處。列來所發給出來的建築執照。要算建造大陸商塲爲最大。那末這商塲面積的廣大。和全厦建築的雄偉。當然在現代的上海市區内。是數一數二的。而且屋基的四面。都是臨接大路。靠南京路方面的正中部分。有高屋八層。兩旁亦都有七層。在山東路轉角處。建有巍塔。計九層。高聳入雲。也是全屋的最高峯。沿九江路的一面。都是四層。全屋係由水泥工程師繆凱伯先生的設計。築成極堅實的幹骨。所以在莊嚴雄秀之外。十分的結固。專配置上東方和上海二鋼窗公司承辦的全部鋼窗。看上去。自然是更覺得優秀美麗了。</p>

<p>(Beiping) Japanese troops advanced towards the Jin-Chao Line. The foremost positions were in Chaoyang Temple, where they came into contact with the righteous armies of Zhu Jiqing, Wang Yunping, Meng Zhaoyan, Li Haifeng, Ma Zidan, and others. Japanese planes flew to the Rehe border for days, dropping intimidating leaflets. Japanese armored vehicles were stationed at Chaoyang Temple Station. To guard against the righteous army, the Japanese army fired artillery at night as a show of force. On the morning of the 23rd, five trains departed from Dahu Mountain on the pseudo-Fengshan route, each carrying five to six hundred Japanese soldiers with heavy ammunition, arriving in Jinzhou without disembarking, turning onto the Jin-Zhi Road towards Yixian. Two Japanese transport trains travel daily on the Jin-Chao Line, and people are prohibited from observing when they arrive at the station. Japanese soldiers patrol back and forth with guns. On the night of the 23rd, Japanese armored vehicles fired four shots near Wanjiatun, and the sound of artillery was heard in Shanhaiguan, attacking the righteous army. The Zheng Guilin's troops in Jinxi sometimes dismantled the road at night, so the Japanese armored vehicles fired artillery as a show of force. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Straw and Saddles to Ward Off the Cold</p>
<p>Grass Roots and Tree Bark to Fill Their Stomachs</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Feng Zhanhai sent representative Xia Yunlong to Nanjing to appeal for aid from all sides. According to reports, his unit has fought over a hundred battles, large and small, with the Japanese and rebel armies. To date, there are over 80,000 men, fully equipped with artillery, infantry, and cavalry, with complete firearms and horses. Because of the lack of economic resources in the defense area, the troops have been rotated back to Rehe for replenishment since last month. Currently, 40,000 men are stationed in Kailu, Jianping, Fuxin, Suidong, Lingyuan, and other counties. The Sun and He units are engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in the Zhan Yu area. There are about 45,000 men remaining in Jilin, two-thirds cavalry and one-third infantry, stationed in Lalin Yushu, Wuchang, Acheng, Shulan, and other counties. They have repeatedly attacked the Japanese army, but all the soldiers have no houses to live in, and due to lack of nutrition, they are all sleeping in the open. The sentries are mostly wrapped in straw and carrying saddles to ward off the cold. Sometimes, supplies are insufficient, and they eat grass roots and tree bark to fill their stomachs. During battles, they often go three to five days without a full meal. Families of soldiers who died in battle have no means of support. There are currently over two hundred women and children following Commander Feng to seek food. Therefore, he urgently hopes that the central government and all parties will provide material assistance. Recently, the Japanese have been increasingly eager to invade Rehe. Japanese armored vehicles frequently travel to the Chaoyang Nanling area to fire artillery in provocation, and airplane bombings and bombings occur almost daily. The reason they have not yet launched an immediate attack is to first eliminate the righteous army before attempting a major offensive. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The seventh division of the tenth district of Beijing City raised 6,000 yuan to aid the righteous army from the staff of various agencies, schools, workers, and friends in the district.

All the strong troops were dispersed in the important fortresses, and another elite team of more than two thousand men was selected and ambushed on the left side of the mountain, waiting for the right time to penetrate deeply and strike hard. The enemy continued to increase reinforcements, gathering more than five thousand troops, and suddenly bombarded our side.

<h3 id="e22">Ministry of Railways Plans to Build Central Station <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Station construction plan of the Ministry of Railways will connect the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai), Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou), Xiangshuo (Hunan-Guangxi), and Jingyue (Beijing-Guangzhou) lines. The Central Station will be located north of the Houzaimen (Back Gate) of the Ming Palace, bounded by Houzaimen to the south, the Central Military Academy and the Lishi Society to the west, and the city walls to the northeast. There are three lines connecting various roads. (1) The connection of the Jinghu Line is stipulated to bifurcate at the Mule House place at the west end of the fork in the line, pass through Tangjiashan and Xinzhuang, and then fold south into Ziyoumen (Freedom Gate) to the Central Station. (2) The connection of the Jinpu Line is stipulated that the current capital railway ferry across the Yangtze River bifurcates near Hepingmen (Peace Gate) on the Jinghu Line, travels west of Xinzhuang, goes south, enters Ziyoumen, and reaches the Central Station. In the future, if a bridge or tunnel can be built across the river, it is planned to cross the river at Beihekou (North River Mouth) outside Shuiximen (Water West Gate), connect to the industrial area and travel east, then connect to Jingxiang and Jingyue and travel north into the city to the Central Station. (3) The connection of the Jingyue and Jingxiang lines is measured to be two lines, one line circling Zijin Mountain, meeting Jinghu, entering Ziyoumen, and the other line going north along the city wall from Yinxiang Town to the north of Zhongshanmen (Sun Yat-sen Gate) and entering the city to the Central Station. After comparison, it was decided to adopt the second line to the Central Station. If you take the road from Xuancheng to Wuhu to Beijing, then pass through another line to Hexiang Town at the Jianggu Li Village along the river, and then take the second line to the Central Station.

<h3 id="e28">Future Actions of Japanese Imperialism Towards China <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Amidst the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations, the situation in Rehe suddenly became tense. What steps will Japanese imperialism take in its future aggression against China?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, all international developments are driven by economic relations, as we have repeatedly stated. The past failures of the authorities in the Northeast stemmed from fiercely competing with the South Manchuria Railway and Dalian Port economically while failing to establish adequate military defenses. After the September 18th Incident, they still regarded it as an accidental event, unaware that it was the inevitable result of economic struggle. They withdrew troops and lost the three provinces. Learning from past mistakes, we believe that Japanese imperialism's future actions will undoubtedly be based on economic relations.</p>
<p>As a result of the development of industrial capital and the expansion of production, Japanese imperialism found that its original colonies were increasingly insufficient to meet its needs for raw materials and the sale of surplus goods. It had to seek to seize the three northeastern provinces as its new colonies. The usual steps for seizing colonies begin with sweet words and enticements, persuading ignorant leaders to sign various treaties to encompass the region's main economic interests. When sweet words and enticements are insufficient and the economic interests obtained by fraud cannot be fully developed and protected, they inevitably resort to military struggle. Since the global panic, international tariffs have increased, and the disease of overproduction has worsened. This innately deficient Japan has seen a sharp increase in unemployment and a sharp decline in cash. The national economy and state finances are in a state of utter destitution. The annexation of the three northeastern provinces had already become an urgent plan with no other options. At that time, the vigorous advancement of railway construction and the Huludao port construction work by the authorities in the Northeast posed a significant threat to the Japanese, which ultimately led to the September 18th Incident. We do not wish to dwell on the misfortunes of the past. The reason for repeatedly stating this is only to prevent the people of our country from rashly regarding simple economic resistance against Japan as sufficient and to realize that economic resistance must be backed by military force.</p>
<p>Economic struggles inevitably lead to military plunder, as evidenced by the Shanghai Incident. After the September 18th Incident, the boycott of Japanese goods was most intense in the Yangtze River basin. Shanghai, as the gateway to the Yangtze River, became the center of the boycott movement due to its geographical location. Precisely because it was the center of the boycott movement, the January 28th Incident occurred. "The use of force against Shanghai was to sweep away the high tide of boycotting Japanese goods in the Yangtze River." This is what the Japanese openly declared to the world.</p>
<p>Looking at the future based on the past, the urgency of the Japanese's future actions against China must depend on the progress or decline of its domestic economic situation. If we have the determination and preparation to resist Japan by force, then economic struggle is a necessary and inevitable means. If we do not have the determination and preparation to resist Japan by force, then we should not feed the enemy with food and drink from afar and serve this new master of the East Asian continent with servile and obsequious behavior. If we still indulge in empty talk of economic resistance, taking pride in the enemy's economic and social turmoil, then we must know that on the eve of the complete overthrow of Japanese imperialism, it will still launch a fierce attack on China, betting everything in a last-ditch struggle. The day we are complacent may be the time when disaster strikes.</p>
<p>Observing from the historical trajectory, the demise of imperialism is not far off, and Japan will hardly be an exception. Japan's use of force in Manchuria was a desperate measure when it was at its wit's end, like digging a well when thirsty. Its inability to save its current system from crisis is already clearly revealed. From now on, as the domestic crisis intensifies, the aggression against our country will inevitably become increasingly intense. The management of the three northeastern provinces cannot be effective in a short period of time, and the activities of the volunteer army have already led to a sharp decline in agricultural production and economic chaos. It will inevitably vent its anger elsewhere and take military action against Rehe and Tianjin, which is almost expected. Given the vastness of the Chinese nation and the historical animosity between the Chinese and Japanese nations, the people of our country, as long as they have a breath, will never accept being led to surrender to the enemy. Therefore, the struggle between China and Japan will inevitably become increasingly expanded and increasingly fierce, which is a matter of course.</p>
<p>Here, we must solemnly inform the people of our country that the intensification of Japanese imperialism's aggression against China is the inevitable result of the development of its domestic capitalism and is not due to the ambitions of a few politicians and warlords. If we still hope for its awareness and expect its retreat, we will continue the mistakes of the past and bring even more grief to the future. Our only way out is to prepare for sacrifice, actively struggle, and definitely not dream of any peaceful solutions.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Anti-Japanese Incidents Among Taiwanese People <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The First Batch of Sixty People Deemed Guilty and Sent to Court</p>
<p>Five People Tragically Suffered Private Torture, Burning of Corpses, and Destruction of Evidence</p>
<p>China United Press, Taipei, 25th - The 4.7 million Taiwanese people have fiercely resisted Japan ever since the Qing government ceded Taiwan to Japan after the First Sino-Japanese War. In the past 38 years, there have been more than 30 revolutions, and approximately 200,000 Taiwanese people have been massacred by the Japanese army. Recently, due to being isolated by the surrounding seas and with no way to receive weapons, they have changed their military resistance to resisting through strikes and various civilized means using the power of national unity. After the Wanbaoshan Incident last year, the anti-Japanese situation suddenly became tense. The Japanese military police then imposed great oppression, so many anti-Japanese fighters fled to southern Fujian and Shanghai, gathering overseas Chinese and students to organize groups to respond to anti-Japanese resistance with their comrades on the island. This was especially intense after the September 18th Incident. At the time of the January 28th Incident, more than 500 people were arrested for anti-Japanese activities in Taiwan, and more than 100 people were arrested from various parts of China (Shanghai, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, etc.) and escorted back to Taiwan. Five people were beaten to death in prison, including two people from Zhushan, Mr. Chen and others, who were moved to Taichung Hospital in late November last year and died in less than two days. More than 30 soldiers and police guarded the hospital, not allowing idlers to enter the hospital. The Japanese police secretly summoned their families to the hospital, threatening them with guns and swords to sign their names, allowing the cremation of the corpses, and prohibiting them from talking about the truth of their wrongful deaths. The reason why the Japanese police cremated them immediately was to prevent people from all walks of life from demanding an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Although the police department lifted the ban on reporting on the anti-Japanese case of the Taiwanese people yesterday, the content was limited to police announcements, and newspapers were not allowed to publish anything else, in an attempt to obscure the truth. Therefore, very few Taiwanese people know the truth. Yesterday, it was decided that the first batch of 60 people were guilty and sent to court. The rest are still in prison, and it is not known whether they are guilty or not. It is heard that among those arrested in China, some were handed over to the Japanese police by the Chinese police. Because the Japanese police used the name of communist party members to coerce our country's police, our country's police, not knowing the truth, believed them to be reactionaries and agreed to hand them over. In fact, they are not communists but national heroes who resist Japan. The Taiwanese people hope that our country's military police will be strictly wary of the Japanese's conspiracies.</p>

At the same time, the 17 divisions across the country will be divided into two types, A (excellent) and B (inferior), to implement the scientificization of the army.</p>

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 25th - The US Navy's recurring budget for next year is 317,583,591 US dollars, plus 1,332,550 US dollars for permanent and non-fixed expenses, totaling 318,906,141 US dollars, which is equivalent to a huge amount of 637,812,282 Japanese yen when calculated in Japanese currency. This is a difference of 265,204,000 Japanese yen compared to the Japanese Navy's budget of 372,608,000 Japanese yen for next year. The notable items are as follows: (1) The maintenance and repair costs of the air force are 13,435,520 US dollars, plus 5,715,000 US dollars for aircraft and catapults, totaling 19,150,520 US dollars. However, the Japanese air force and aircraft weapon costs are 15,594,000 Japanese yen. If calculated at par, the US Navy is 22,270,740 Japanese yen more. (1) The construction cost of warships is 15,053,000 US dollars, and the construction cost from the Navy's supply fund is 6,000,000 US dollars, totaling 21,063,000 US dollars, while the additional amount for Japanese warship construction is 15,000,000 Japanese yen, which is a huge difference compared to the US. Even if the new warship maintenance cost of 15,195,000 Japanese yen is added, there is still a difference of 11,931,000 Japanese yen. (1) The cost of armored vehicles and ammunition is 3,000,000 US dollars, but the Japanese armament enrichment cost of 21,710,000 Japanese yen is larger. The right is to supplement the Shanghai Incident and other usage and repair costs, so when compared with ordinary times, the United States is larger. (1) The reconstruction cost of the US battleships 組, Mexico, Mississippi, etc., is 14,000,000 US dollars, which is 28,000,000 Japanese yen when calculated at the Japanese par value. Compared with the Japanese warship reconstruction cost of 20,068,800 Japanese yen, it is 7,311,200 Japanese yen more. However, 12 of the 15 US battleships have been retrofitted, so it is an additional cost for the reconstruction of the remaining three. However, Japan is for the entire refurbishment. (1) The construction cost is 24,920,000 US dollars, but the Japanese workshop maintenance cost is only 394,000 Japanese yen, which is a huge difference.</p>

Other suffering includes the increasing disagreement and mutual strife among nations due to the worsening economic panic. The people who work hard should receive just assistance and compassionate sympathy, and the impact of the panic on them is especially severe. As for the joyous events of this year, the most important is the success of the Eucharistic Congress in Dublin, the capital of the Irish Free State. Amidst the various difficulties in the world, the missionary work is gradually expanding, which is gratifying. The Pope is also happy to have installed a radio station, saying that with this radio station, he can bless all countries in the world. The blessings he expresses to all nations are "peace, tranquility, mutual trust, friendship, and mutual assistance." The Pope also wants to hold a commemoration for the 1,900th anniversary of Jesus's death. The commemoration ceremony will last for a year, from April 2nd (Good Friday) to April 2nd of the following year. However, whether it will be held from 1933 or 1934 cannot be determined yet.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Saito, Seeing Through the Weaknesses of the Seiyukai, Refuses to Be Outdone <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Threatening to Dissolve the Diet</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 25th - While it is rumored in Japanese political circles that the Seiyukai will strengthen its tough stance against the government and attempt to overthrow the Saito cabinet, the government originally intended to yield and beg for forgiveness from the Seiyukai. Because there are many important bills in the 64th Diet, once it shows weakness, the government's proposals will be difficult to pass and it will gain nothing in the end. Saito, seeing that public opinion still supports the current government, has made the greatest determination. If the Seiyukai dares to challenge, he will dissolve the Diet and break the Seiyukai's absolute majority. If the Diet is dissolved, the Seiyukai will not be able to maintain its current power and may have to share the world with the Minseito. Therefore, leaders such as Suzuki want to avoid war, manipulating the hardliners in the party, and maintaining the government on the condition that power will be handed over to the Seiyukai after the Diet in the spring. However, Saito, seeing through the internal weaknesses of the Seiyukai, still adheres to a tough policy to deal with the Seiyukai. The two sides are scheming against each other, fighting fiercely in the open and in secret. Because the Genro still maintains the Saito cabinet, if the Seiyukai challenges, dissolving the Diet may be unavoidable.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Pengu Visits the US Ambassador Suddenly to Discuss War Debt Issues <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 24th - French Prime Minister Pengu suddenly visited US Ambassador Edge today. This was not just an ordinary visit as initially expected. The two talked for more than fifteen minutes before parting. This unexpected action has attracted the attention of diplomatic and political circles. It is reported that Pengu suggested that the United States put forward a proposal so that war debt negotiations could be reopened and expressed that although he was bound by the Congress's refusal to pay before negotiating war debts, if the United States expresses some measure to reopen negotiations, then the congressional bill can be amended. Although no press release has been issued regarding what the two talked about, newspapers mostly believe that direct US-France negotiations have actually begun. "Le Matin" stated that after the US Ambassador explained the situation in Washington in detail, Pengu put forward some concrete proposals, which will be telegraphed to the White House by the US Ambassador. "Le Journal" stated that, in any case, the chaotic situation previously caused by conflicting messages from Washington has been clarified.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Warlike and Oppressive, Japanese People's Suicide Craze <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Root Cause is the Hard Life</p>
<p>Most are Young People</p>
<p>Tokyo News - According to statistics from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's Identification Division, 1,851 Japanese people committed suicide last year (Showa 6), including 1,160 men and 691 women. As of the end of September this year, it has reached 1,846 people. The reasons are suicide pacts (men and women dying together), broken hearts, family discord, difficult life, illness, disappointment, old age pessimism, mental disorder, etc. The root cause is the oppression of life. Secondly, in terms of age, those between 20 and 25 years old are the most numerous. For example, among the 178 suicides (105 men, 73 women) from September 1 this year, 48 were between 21 and 25 years old, followed by 36 between 16 and 20 years old, and 29 between 26 and 30 years old. The above and below are all in the minority. Also, among those who committed suicide between the ages of 16 and 20, women are more than twice as many as men. For example, in September, there were 13 men and 23 women, while in other age groups, women were less than half as many as men. As for the method of suicide, the most recent is using sleeping pills, followed by poisonous gas. According to statistics, 32 people committed suicide with poisonous gas last year, increasing to 75 people as of the end of September this year, followed by jumping off buildings. All of these are new methods that have not been seen in previous years. (World News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e49">Northeast Problem and the League of Nations (9) <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The day before the Administrative Yuan meeting, our country's Chief Representative, Dr. Yen Hui-ching, especially hosted a reception for foreign news reporters at the representative office, explaining China's hopes for the League of Nations. He stated, "Militarism is what we oppose, but when it becomes absolutely necessary, China may also be forced to resort to it." Many newspapers highlighted this statement, as Europeans no longer dare to look down on the Chinese after the 19th Route Army resisted Japan in Shanghai. The gist of the speech was that the Chinese government has no intention of overturning the facts presented in the Lytton Report. The Chinese government may not completely agree with all the points mentioned in the report, but the members of the investigation team were all respected figures of the time, and were mutually agreed upon. The nature of the investigation was purely neutral and impartial. Therefore, challenging the findings of the investigation team, especially when the truth is so clear, is self-evident. The Chinese representatives have come here not to declare that the Chinese government has adopted and insisted on a policy that directly violates the suggestions and advice of the investigation team, and disregards the constraints of the League of Nations and treaty obligations. We are not here to advocate militarism. China has been resisting Japanese aggression bare-handed for more than a year, and is now prepared to persevere to the end. If necessary, in order to seek liberation, we will not hesitate to use all possible militaristic methods. However, the Chinese government deeply abhors militarism, detests war, and longs for peace. The Chinese representatives have come to Geneva to ask the League to grant us peace and justice. In the past fourteen months, although China has suffered extreme pain, it has consistently maintained its faith in the League of Nations, while Japan's acts of aggression have intensified day by day. Its undeclared war has also created many obstacles for the disarmament conference and the future of peace in Europe. We know that what the militarists who control Japan desire is not peace, but war. They do not see the League of Nations' actions as a fair solution, but as an opportunity to delay and obtain a negative guarantee of international non-interference, while still relentlessly advancing the aggressive plans for the undeclared war that began a year ago. The Chinese government's goodwill and loyalty to the League of Nations can help remedy this tragedy, and has done so in the past and will continue to do so in the future. We firmly believe that since we can keep faith with the League of Nations, the member states of the League will also keep faith with China. You are all deeply aware of the obligations stipulated in the various articles of the League of Nations Covenant, whether they have already been invoked by the Chinese government, or have not yet been invoked, but may be forced to be invoked in the future. However, you may not yet fully understand how the main factual assertions in the investigation report relate to these obligations. I venture to summarize them for your reference: First, the investigation team disregarded the reason that "China's current situation is such that it should have its membership in the League of Nations revoked, and all protection clauses in the covenant do not apply to China," considering it inappropriate. The report states that the policy initiated at the Washington Conference in 1922, and included in the Nine-Power Treaty, aimed to give China sufficient time and freedom to devote itself to national construction without being subjected to foreign aggression. This policy is still of concern to the relevant powers and is necessary for maintaining world peace. If you look at the letter from US Secretary of State Stimson to Senator Borah in February of last year, you can see its contents and the special focus is on this point. The investigation team also stated that in the ten years since the Washington Conference, China has made considerable progress in national construction and consolidation. The only threat to the Chinese central government is communism. The government has made great efforts to eradicate communism and has formulated an economic recovery policy, but as a result of Japan's aggressive actions, communist activities have been greatly encouraged and the government's efforts have been thwarted. However, I can tell you that since the report was completed, the Chinese government has had definite success in its anti-communist campaign, achieving great military victories, and various road-building projects, rural projects, credit projects, and other projects to help farmers are being implemented one by one with excellent results. The Chinese government has hired many League of Nations experts to plan and implement this and other construction work. As for the three northeastern provinces, the report clearly points out that they are undeniably and immovably Chinese territory, and 93 percent of their residents are Chinese. Therefore, in many respects, the three northeastern provinces are completely the same as other parts of China, separated only by the Great Wall. Forcing them to separate from other parts of China will create difficulties and endanger peace. The great agricultural development of the three northeastern provinces is also entirely due to the efforts of the Chinese. The relationship between the three northeastern provinces and other parts of China has become increasingly close in the past 25 years, and the Chinese people have become increasingly active in the industrial and commercial development of the area. The three northeastern provinces are China's treasury, an outlet for the surplus population of neighboring provinces, and China's first line of defense. At the same time, the report also states that the three northeastern provinces are not suitable for Japanese immigration. Japan's economic interests in Manchuria are secondary to Japan's interests in the entire Chinese market, or in India and the United States. Japan's treaty rights in Manchuria are sometimes questionable, and Japan often interprets these rights in a one-sided and provocative manner. The investigation team stated that Japan's position in Manchuria was obtained through two wars. In fact, in addition to two wars, there was also the threat of a third war, namely the Twenty-One Demands and the ultimatum of 1915. The rights obtained by Japan through these methods have greatly constrained China in exercising its national sovereignty. Therefore, if this position is not agreed upon, willing, or accepted by both parties, conflict is almost inevitable. The report also stated that there was no so-called independence movement before the Japanese army invaded Manchuria. The planning, organization, and establishment of "Manchukuo" were all carried out by Japanese officials under the orders of the Japanese military, and all sovereignty was in the hands of the Japanese authorities, which was deeply hated by the Chinese residents. If we were to tolerate and recognize it, it would be inconsistent with existing treaty obligations. The report also stated that the Sino-Japanese dispute arose from the premeditated acts of aggression by the Japanese army. The Chinese authorities made every effort to avoid any provocative actions, and the peaceful methods of resolving Sino-Japanese pending issues had not been exhausted. The report also stated that as a result of Japan's acts of aggression, bandits were rampant throughout the three northeastern provinces, and various illegal incidents occurred one after another, unprecedented in history. Organized warfare is taking place everywhere, and the suffering of the people is indescribable. Sino-Japanese relations are in a state of virtual war, and the future is full of thorns. Finally, the report also made a careful suggestion about the Japanese army openly planning this act of aggression under the leadership of the Minister of the Army, and advocating direct action in newspapers. More than a year has passed since Japan began its aggression plan. The Chinese government has consistently submitted the entire case to the League of Nations for resolution with a calm and upright attitude. The Chinese government's accusations against the Japanese army's acts of violence and political conspiracies have been fully proven by the investigation team. Therefore, it is time for China and the world to hope that the League of Nations will take swift and decisive steps to resolve the issue. We firmly believe that Japan's delaying tactics to implement its sinister plan to use force or political conspiracies to exacerbate the situation should no longer be tolerated by us. The League of Nations, the world peace organization in Geneva, will finally show the world that what the League of Nations represents is fairness and justice, and that it has the courage to decide on a solution to the dispute and implement this decision.</p>
<p>Also, the night before the meeting, the League of Nations Broadcasting Station invited Sir Lytton, the head of the investigation team, to speak, and he made every effort to refute Japan's comments after the report was released. Also, the Pathé company invited Representative Gu to speak about Sino-Japanese relations in a sound film. These two actions have attracted the most attention from the public.</p>
<p>According to general observations, Matsuoka's attendance at the League of Nations shows that Japan has implemented military diplomacy. Matsuoka openly stated when hosting foreign news reporters that "Militarism is sometimes better than diplomatic policies. Therefore, we hope that the League of Nations can take positive measures to resolve the Northeast issue. It is like quenching thirst with plums, and the longer the time, the weaker the Volunteer Army's power in the Northeast. It is essential to seek solutions from within. It is absolutely impossible to rely entirely on diplomacy. In addition to supporting the Volunteer Army to continue fighting and intensifying economic self-defense by boycotting Japanese goods, we must also restore diplomatic relations with Russia as soon as possible and arm the whole country."</p>
<p>Matsuoka's speech is forceful and unreasonable, not worth laughing at, but it can be used for our reference. If there is anything to correct in his attacks on us, we will correct it; if there is nothing, we will encourage ourselves. Therefore, it is attached as an appendix.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Japanese Left-Leaning Groups <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Japanese left-leaning groups, in theory, range from Marxism to anarchism. From the perspective of actual action, they should be more radical than the Social Democratic Party. In other words, their ideal future is socialism, and their reform proposals, whether legal or illegal, aim to break the status quo and establish a new society, without any suspicion of colluding with the military. Only then can they be called left-leaning groups. However, since 1925, Japanese proletarian political parties have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, sprouting everywhere. Their content is not very solid, and the split movement is quite obvious. Therefore, at the beginning of the implementation of general elections, there were only eight members of parliament. Since the sudden rise of militarism and the universalization of fascist national states last year, the various factions of the proletarian political parties have been restricted to illegal underground movements on the left and threatened by fascist violence on the right, and have had to tend towards further division. Therefore, the proletarian party's power in the current parliament is very weak. Out of 466 seats, the Social Democratic Party only has Isoo Abe, Genjiro Sugiyama, and Kanichiro Eda, a total of three members. Yojiro Matsutani, who broke away from the Social Democratic Party and established another faction, has one member. In addition, Shiro Koike, a member of the National Socialist Party who is flying the banner of the proletarian party but secretly approaching the military, has one member. In total, there are only five seats. If the National Socialist Party is excluded, there are only four proletarian party members. If they cannot get the assistance of the National Alliance, their proposals and speeches have no real status. From this, it can be seen that the connection between parliamentary struggle and the left-leaning movement is very shallow. The election of members of the Japanese House of Representatives requires an election campaign fund of no less than 200,000 yen. How can the representatives of the proletariat afford it (?) However, in this time of storms and fundamental shaking of parliamentary politics, it is a strange sight that believers in socialism can actually serve as a embellishment in the parliament surrounded by militarism, expressing another meaning.</p>
<p>The various factions of the proletarian party's legal movement are originally extremely complex (at the beginning of the formation of the party, there were more than fifteen factions). However, after many reshuffles, there is only the Social Democratic Party (formed by the merger of the Social Democratic Party and the Masses Party). Its political program includes: 1. Fighting to protect the lives of workers, peasants, and the general working masses; 2. Overthrowing capitalism and promoting the management of non-productive and financial institutions by the state. Workers must ensure the productive self-sufficiency of labor, establish a labor system that ensures the lives of producers, and complete social insurance; 3. National land ownership and establishment of a land system that ensures cultivation rights, (autonomous) cooperation in agricultural management, mechanization of agricultural production, and state control of important agricultural products; 4. Construction of economic conferences, establishment of a publicly funded education system for the children of working people, and public management of housing and hospitals; 5. Integration of industry and agriculture and balancing of urban and rural areas; 6. Equality of world nations and construction of world peace.</p>
<p>The total number of members of the Social Democratic Party is about 120,000, and the number of workers and peasants it can influence is estimated to be around 250,000. Urban workers are facing the threat of unemployment due to the excessive panic in the market and the implementation of rationalization, which has led to shorter working hours and lower wages. As a result, the social situation is deteriorating. Last year alone, there were as many as 2,456 strike incidents, more than twice as many as in 1926. This year, there have been nearly 2,000 strike incidents up to November, two and a half times more than in 1929. This kind of movement cannot be guided by the Masses Party. In the mass movement, there is also another kind of illegal organization secretly active.</p>
<p>What is this illegal organization? (?) The monster that lingers in Europe has moved to Japan in East Asia. It is the Communist Party. The party has been a secret organization from the beginning, with a small number of members and mostly intellectuals. Its strength was originally very weak. Although it had agile activities in various public organizations, after the two major arrests on March 15, 1928, and April 16, 1929, the number of people arrested exceeded 1,000, and most of the important figures were imprisoned. The guidance of the movement was completely stopped. With the government's severe crackdown and the extreme oppression of right-wing groups, the Communist Party in Japan had to enter an underground movement state. But as far as we know, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>1. The labor movement influenced by the Communist Party is the left-wing masses in the National Labor Union Federation (Japan), with a number of about less than 30,000.</p>
<p>2. The Communist Party has farmer committee activities in the National Farmers Union (Japan). It has cultivated considerable power among tenant farmers. Every time there is a struggle with landlords, farmer committee members are involved (the number of people influenced is no less than 50,000).</p>
<p>3. In the army and in right-wing groups, there are Communist Party groups, and they use the weapons of right-wing groups to carry out some of their violent plans. For example, in the robbery case of the Kawasaki 100th Bank Omori Branch, the Communist Party possessed more than 100 pistols (obtained through right-wing groups).</p>
<p>4. The propaganda publications include [Red Flag] (monthly), but it is extremely difficult to publish. The publications led by it include "International" (monthly), which specializes in introducing the international situation of the Communist Party, "Industrial Labor Communication" (ten-day publication), which specializes in recording the situation of the workers' and peasants' movement, and sells quite well, "Our Science" (monthly), which explains the current situation from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism, and "Proletarian Literature" (monthly), which is a purely public publication, but its sharpness is no less than that of secret publications, so it is often banned from publication. However, the stricter the ban, the faster the sales.</p>
<p>Under this severe oppression, because there are too many social contradictions and general living is extremely difficult, even severe penalties cannot stop the "reddening" of general thought, and left-leaning publications are selling extremely fast. Even judicial dignity has invaded "reddening." From this, it can be seen that the social problems in Japan are serious. Even if it exerts its strength to invade, it is difficult to suppress the progress of the revolutionary movement. (Tokyo, December 19)</p>

<h3 id="e51">Another Report on the Fushun Massacre <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Rongjiu's Story of Escaping from Death</p>
<p>More Than Three Thousand People Killed by a Single Bullet</p>
<p>Tragic Voices Heard After the Massacre</p>
<p>Returning Covered in Blood, Still Suspecting It Was a Ghost</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Fushun Pingdingshan Japanese Army Massacre incident has been reported in previous newspapers by the American International News Agency reporter, Mr. Hunter, after inspecting and publishing a report. Now, Zhang Rongjiu, a Fushun refugee, escaped to Beiping yesterday, detailing the situation of the Japanese army's atrocities at the time. Zhang is from Lizigou. At that time, his family was tricked into going to Pingdingshan, and all his family members were killed. He himself was able to survive because he was covered in blood. After the incident, he escaped and came to Beiping. He was still horrified when he spoke. After finishing, he also said that if there was half a word of lie, he would be punished by heaven, which shows his grief and anger. The details of his conversation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"I am from Lizigou, Fushun County. On the morning of September 16, a team of Japanese soldiers suddenly came to our village, led by a translator who could speak Chinese. They told each household that the Japanese army wanted to borrow our village to practice combat, and told us residents to all hide in the nearby Pingdingshan mountain ditch. At that time, my family of six, my mother, wife, son, my brother Pengjiu, and my sister-in-law Zhao, were eating. We were about to tell him to wait until we finished eating before leaving, but those fierce Japanese soldiers, one by one, glared their eyes, holding their guns and saying, 'Go, go.' We didn't bother to pack up the eating utensils and ran out in a very embarrassing manner. When we got to the entrance of the village, we saw that all the people in the village, one by one, supporting the old and carrying the young, were heading towards Pingdingshan under the escort of a team of Japanese soldiers. When we got to Pingdingshan, we saw that the people from Pingdingshan Village were already sitting there in groups of three or five. Some said that the Japanese army was going to practice artillery, and some said that the Xuantong Emperor had sent an imperial envoy to distribute relief. But while they were discussing, six or seven hundred more farmers came, some women carrying babies, some old ladies in their seventies or eighties being supported, and they were also escorted by Japanese soldiers to this Pingdingshan ditch. It turned out that these were the people from Qianjinbao. Among them was a distant relative of mine, called Tong Erge, who was carrying his mother on his back. I greeted him and told him to sit with me. Suddenly, I heard a whistle, and I saw that the Japanese soldiers who had escorted us and the Japanese soldiers who had escorted other villagers gathered together. After another round of commands, they separated around us. The few people who could speak Chinese said to us, 'Now the emperor is going to give you money. You all kneel down and thank him. Let us take a picture first, and then you can receive the reward.' As they spoke, the Japanese soldiers were busy arranging things that looked like cylindrical black and shiny things on many tripods. We thought they were cameras, but we saw a few people in our village standing up and running, shouting, 'It's not good, the Japanese are going to fire machine guns.' Before they finished speaking, we saw that the long筒-shaped cameras we imagined were spitting out flames with a ping ping pang pang sound. At that time, more than three thousand people were running around, calling for help, shouting for their children and daughters in great chaos, and everyone fell down in response. My brother was more alert than me. He was the first to stand up and try to escape, but the ruthless bullet hit him right in the head. A stream of blood shot out from his forehead and he fell down, just lying on top of me. I also fell down on the ground with him. After a period of ghosts crying and gods howling, the earth-shattering chaos passed. Then, I heard the faint humming, moaning, and wailing sounds coming from all around. Then, I heard the Japanese soldiers laughing, scolding, cursing, the sound of bayonets being used, screams of panic, tragic sounds, and fading sounds. While I was panicked, and being pressed down by my brother's body, and scared to move, half-conscious, I felt the Japanese soldiers kicking me twice with their leather shoes. But my whole body was soaked in my brother's blood, dripping with blood. The Japanese soldiers thought I was definitely dead. After I don't know how much time passed, I heard no sound around me, and the sky seemed to be dim. I peeked and saw corpses all around, some lying on their backs, some falling face down, and the ground was full of crimson blood. I barely struggled to get up and looked around. There was not a single living person. My mother, my wife, my sister-in-law, my brother, each of them had been dead for a long time, and the wounds were still bleeding. My son died even more tragically, his face blurred and his brains splattered. After this tragic change, I was like a madman, like a fool, and I didn't know whether I was a human or a ghost, whether I was dead or alive. I tried my best to run wildly, wanting to run back to the village, but looking from afar, the raging fire in our village had not yet been extinguished. At this time, my mind had become slightly clearer. I suddenly remembered that there was a relative in Gongjiagou across the river. I crawled and rolled to that place. When the relative saw me looking like a blood ghost, he was trembling with fear. He put me in the house and gave me a bowl of cold water to drink. It took me a long time to speak. The next day, he was afraid that the Japanese soldiers would find me and implicate his family. He changed me into a set of old clothes, gathered some travel money, and sent me to another relative inside the customs. I think I was frightened. I often woke up in my sleep at night and ran wildly, or screamed. My family is all dead, and I don't want to live anymore. Alas, this is the happiness enjoyed by the citizens of "Manchukuo." This is the taste that countless people in the Northeast taste every day. What I have said above is my personal experience of Zhang Rongjiu escaping from death. If there is half a word of lie, I will be punished by heaven." (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e52">Japanese Atrocities <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>｜Northeast People Rise Up in Struggle｜</p>
<p>Although the people of Northeast China harbored resentment towards Japan, before September 18th, it wasn't very intense. Even after September 18th, it hadn't truly become a matter of sworn enemies. Therefore, when the "Manchukuo Puppet State" was established, there were still many people who put on a show of support. Some of them were, of course, forcing a smile through tears and reluctantly complying to endure the situation temporarily. Some genuinely welcomed the restoration of the Qing Dynasty, especially in culturally backward areas, where they felt that the appearance of the true emperor was a future blessing. However, after several months, not only did their dreams not come true, but those who initially thought it was a bitter affair naturally felt even more that there was nowhere to shed their tears. Of course, they were absolutely not allowed to speak (if three people talked, it would easily be a crime). Even those who originally supported the puppet regime's emergence felt unable to express their suffering. They were constantly scolded. Those who held official positions within the puppet government could only wash their faces with tears in private. Ordinary merchants and farmers also found their food tasteless and their sleep restless. The reasons for their unease were: first, the number of Japanese officials increased day by day (it is said that all the unemployed intellectuals and vagrants in Japan envied the glory of holding official positions in Manchuria and came to Manchuria to become officials), and their power also grew day by day; second, Korean farmers streamed into the Northeast to cultivate land, even driving out the original landowners and forcing the original landlords and tenants to relocate, allowing them to reside and cultivate the land. As a result, people with land lost their land and became unemployed, and those who originally did odd jobs had no choice but to become beggars. Therefore, the Northeast people's resentment towards the Japanese has shifted from a few to a majority. People of all social classes almost universally hate the Japanese. This is no longer a simple landlord-tenant relationship but a widespread expansion of national hatred. The people of our three eastern provinces have mostly gained a new understanding, especially regarding relations with Japan. Although the time for a true reckoning has not yet arrived, there will eventually be a day to settle accounts with them.</p>
<p>Currently, the large-scale volunteer armies have undoubtedly failed. For example, Commander Su Bingwen, Generals Zhang Dianjiu, and Wu Delin raised the flag of resistance for two months, struggling to survive in the freezing snow. Bullets were being used up one by one, and food was being consumed day by day. Moreover, Japanese soldiers were continuously increasing their numbers. At the same time, the flanking attacks by the invaders, crossing the Greater Khingan Range from the Solon area to the north to strike Hailar from the side, made it impossible for the starving and freezing volunteer army to resist. However, although they failed, the Northeast people have awakened since then, and their anti-Japanese sentiment has increased even more due to the defeat. Even though Commander Su and his subordinates left the Northeast, the Northeast people did not sell themselves out, at least not in their hearts. Only a very small minority were willing to be lackeys of Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>Therefore, Japan, which considers itself a conqueror, is also very wary of the activities of the volunteer army. According to the Japanese, the number of volunteer soldiers in August and September this year was no less than 250,000. According to our calculations, it was around 300,000. However, now that the "green curtain" [crops that can hide soldiers] has disappeared, the large-scale volunteer army has had to break into smaller units and temporarily lie low to wait for the coming year. However, at present, the combined number of volunteer armies that continue to operate and constantly attack the enemy is still no less than 100,000. The reason for not being able to win is that our army is relatively scattered, its organizational strength is not very solid, and it lacks guns, bullets, food, and clothing. The tactic of each person fighting on their own is too outdated. However, the so-called "Peace Preservation Guerrilla Force," which harasses the countryside and extorts and oppresses the people everywhere, is in fact a "Aggression Guerrilla Force," because when they come, the people cannot sleep peacefully. Everyone has no choice. In various counties in Liaoning, there are organizations of the Big Sword Society. On the 15th of this month, a large unit of the so-called "Peace Preservation Force" ran to Tuchengzi, west of Dashiqiao (a major station on the South Manchuria Railway), to fight guerrillas and engaged in a battle with the local Big Sword Society. They killed their commander, Colonel Mori, and Lieutenant Kinoshita on the spot. In addition, Majors Nagata and Abe, and Chief Quartermaster Takahashi, and other important officers, were all seriously injured. Now, the Japanese side is mobilizing a large force, preparing to carry out their old trick of massacre.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army invaded Northeast China and established the puppet state, not only are Japanese officials in Changchun flaunting the "Manchukuo" signboard and acting recklessly, but also in the county governments, newly established positions of councilors, secretaries, instructors, and patrol officers in the police stations are all filled by Japanese. Two or three months ago, a large number of Japanese ronin ran to Manchuria to become officials. Those who had special relationships with the military or the likes of Komai and Ohashi could become high-ranking officials; otherwise, they could also become small officials to satisfy their ambitions. In short, under the control of the great military power, the Japanese truly rose like dogs and chickens to heaven. High-ranking officials naturally controlled the entire "Manchukuo," exploiting it as much as possible, while small officials in the counties were even more direct extortionists. Their oppression of the common people was dozens or hundreds of times worse than that of the officials in the previous Qing Dynasty. This is because the officials in the previous Qing Dynasty were mostly crude, and their methods of extortion were also very clumsy, so poor people could still find a way to survive amidst the crudeness and clumsiness. But now the Japanese have learned many new methods of extortion, which are as dense as hairs on an ox. Their ways of making money are also bloodless. For example, the tobacco monopoly seems to have some justification, but the demands of the population census truly cause unrest even among chickens and dogs. All the interests of the people are taken away by them, even the fields (that have been cultivated) are arbitrarily occupied, leaving the farmers who till the land with nowhere to escape. Therefore, the Northeast people's resentment towards the Japanese increases day by day. All Japanese officials and Japanese dogs who go to the countryside arouse the resentment of the local people. Therefore, last month, the councilor of Fenghuang City, Tomota Toshiaki, the secretary, Nishi Tatsuki, the instructor, Shirai Narumi, and the patrol officers, Fujii and Kamon, were ostensibly sent by the Japanese military to persuade the volunteer army to surrender, but in fact, they went to the countryside to plunder. Any law-abiding commoner, as long as their family had some money, would be labeled as a "bandit" to extort money and fill their own pockets. Little did they know that they would happen to encounter the volunteer army led by Deng Tiemei, giving them a hard blow. The five "money-loving and greedy" fellows all lost their lives. Now, Japan has sent a regiment of infantry, attached with artillery, aircraft, and cavalry, which is confronting Deng's approximately 4,000 troops in the Motianling area east of Gaiping. In the near future, a bloody battle will be inevitable. (December 17th, in Shenyang)</p>
<h3 id="e53">He Chengjun to Go to Shaanxi to Supervise Troops <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Chiang Orders Tian Songyao to Increase Troops in Northern Sichuan to Prevent Bandits from Roving</p>
<p>Banditry in Southern Hubei Intensifies Again, Zhu Shaoliang Orders General Offensive</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xu Xiangqian's remnants, after fleeing to Hanzhong, were blocked by the Shaanxi army and retreated south. After He Long's bandits dispersed, they had already fled to the border of Shaanxi and Sichuan. With their strength divided, it is easy to eliminate them. He Chengjun returned to Hankou from Nanjing a few days ago and planned to go to Xi'an soon to supervise the suppression. However, due to his poor health, he could not travel, so he could not make the trip. Now, because the task is important and should not be delayed, he has decided to depart from Hankou on the 25th. The personnel accompanying him to Shaanxi have already been appointed today (the 23rd). They include Chief of Staff Guan Linshu, Senior Staff Officer Xu Chengxi, Director of the Office Chen Guangzu, Adjutant Cao Zhenwu, Secretary Li Peng, Staff Officers Xu Xuzhong, Guan Wenhui, Wang Shuxian, Chen Yucang, Chief of the Military Supplies Section Fu Benhou, Section Member Ma Zhicheng, Chief of the Public Relations Section Peng Shuyou, Adjutants Zhao Yixue and Wang Xiongfei, Telegraph Operators Pan Tingzhen, Zhang Mingzhai, Liu Jiahua, and Che Zhaoyi, and Clerks Wang Boyin and Zhou Jisheng, totaling more than 20 people. After He's deployment, he immediately ordered the Pinghan Railway Bureau to prepare a special train and keep the fires lit. According to what He told the press, he will set up his headquarters in Xi'an for this trip to supervise the suppression of the remaining bandits and will be able to return to Hankou in at most one month. After He goes to Shaanxi, the affairs of the Pacification Headquarters will be handled by Chief of Staff Yang Kui on his behalf. As for the reserve team accompanying He to Shaanxi, the 1233rd Regiment, a supplement to the 44th Division, received He's order on the 22nd to take two trains to Zhengzhou and then to Xi'an. One battalion of infantry and one platoon of special service troops will be stationed in Huayuantun to escort He when he passes by. In addition, the 29th Army of Sichuan, under Tian Songyao, received a telegram from Chairman Chiang on the 17th, ordering them to increase their defense in northern Sichuan to prevent the remaining bandits from fleeing into Sichuan. He has sent Liu Hanxiong with three regiments to garrison in Guangyuan, and Li Weirui with four regiments to garrison in Tongjiang and Nanjiang. Together with the brigade previously dispatched and a brigade of border defense troops from Sichuan and Shaanxi, there are a total of two brigades and seven regiments. Although the bandits are fierce, they dare not easily enter this shady place.</p>
<p>The Kong bandits in southern Hubei have recently become rampant again. On the 14th, with a fake 7th, 8th, and 9th regiment, numbering several thousand, with more than 3,000 guns, they launched a surprise attack on Maojiapu in Lingma Township near Jinniu in Echeng County. The area only had four platoons from the first and third companies of the local militia, and their strength was weak. They were eventually defeated by the bandits. Two platoon leaders of the first company and more than 20 soldiers were killed in action, and more than 20 guns were lost. The commander of the third company was captured, along with 20 squad leaders, and 20 guns were lost. The bandits then occupied Maojiapu as a temporary nest. At the same time, there were bandit disturbances in other places. Zhu Shaoliang, the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in the border area of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, returned to Puqi from Changsha on an armored train on the 20th. On the 22nd, he ordered Guo Runao, Rong Jingfang, Xie Bin, Li Dingwu, and Zhang Gang to launch a general offensive against the bandits. Zhu was stationed on the armored train, personally directing the operation. On the 23rd, he sent his adjutant Li Dingmin to Hankou to report the progress of the suppression to the General Headquarters and the Pacification Headquarters. It is said that Zhu will go to northern Jiangxi to supervise the suppression after the remaining bandits there are eliminated. The General Headquarters may be moved to Jiujiang. (December 23rd)</p>

<p>People's Livelihood Declines, Selling Wives and Children</p>
<p>The Cock's Crow at Dusk Is Universally Considered Ominous</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since the Xinhai Revolution in Shaanxi, the ravages of soldiers and bandits and the cruelty of natural disasters over the past 20 years have been extremely tragic. In particular, the two "tigers guarding the city" and the two major famines have caused immense suffering to the people and devastation to the region, which is most lamentable. Recently, a friend arrived in Taiyuan from Chang'an, describing the recent situation in Shaanxi in great detail. The disasters in Shaanxi are still as they were in the past. According to reports, remnants of the Communist Party, due to the disasters in Hubei and Henan provinces, have entered Shaanxi again. They were originally divided into two routes, one led by Xu Xiangqian, who is from Wutai, Shanxi, and a graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy, and the other led by He Long. Xu's troops entered Shaanxi from Laohekou, passing through Shangnan and Lantian, exiting the Ziwu Valley, and heading towards Hu, Feng, Qi, and Baoji, entering the Southern Mountains and Foping, plotting to occupy Hanzhong. He's troops followed the Han River around Baihe, attempting to flee into the Xing'an area. The northward flight of these two groups is similar to the White Wolf's actions in the early years of the Republic. Upon receiving the report, the central government initially ordered the Shaanxi army to suppress them. Later, seeing the situation was serious, they ordered He Chengjun to supervise the troops and coordinate with Yang Hucheng, the chairman of the Shaanxi provincial government, to block and suppress them. Currently, the anti-Communist troops entering Shaanxi include Liu Maoen, Xiao Zhichu, Hu Zongnan, and Huang Jie's troops, totaling four divisions. Aside from Sun Weiru in Gansu and Ma Qingyuan's troops, which have been disbanded due to suspicion, only Feng Qinzai and Wu Mianzhi's troops remain in Shaanxi under Yang Hucheng. Currently, Huang Jie's troops (Huang's troops were reorganized from the remnants of Fan Zhongxiu, Cui Erdan, and his own troops) and Feng Qinzai's troops are responsible for the defense of the Tongguan to Weinan area. Liu's troops are cooperating with Wu's troops, pursuing and suppressing from Shangluo all the way to Zhouzhi, where they are stationed. Xiao's troops are stationed in Hu County, and Hu's troops are stationed between Zhouzhi and Hu County. Wu Mianzhi's other troops are also stationed nearby. This is the current situation of the anti-bandit troops' deployment and the areas they are responsible for encircling. When the Communist Party first fled into Shaanxi, their numbers were no less than 50,000 to 60,000. After being blocked and suppressed by the government troops from all directions, the number of casualties and those who fled was not small. Moreover, the Communist Party was under pressure from both the front and the rear, and they were extremely exhausted upon entering Shaanxi. Some fell asleep while eating, and some fell asleep while standing. Their clothing was also mixed and messy, with men wearing women's clothes and women wearing men's clothes, because everything was looted from the people, so they didn't have time to distinguish them. When He's troops fled to Baihe, the troops of Zhang Feisheng's division made every effort to block them. The fierce fighting was extremely intense, with countless people killed. Baihe turned into a sea of blood, and its cruelty was unprecedented. Now, Xu and He each lead remnants into the Southern Mountains, relying on the mountains to occupy the area. After many fierce battles between the government troops and the Communist bandits, they have gained experience. They are taking a cautious attitude and are not easily engaging with the bandits. They are only sitting and watching the situation, waiting for an opportunity to change. Therefore, although the Communist Party in the Southern Mountains is said to be remnants, it will not be easy to eliminate them all at once. There is a rumor that the Communist Party's plan to flee into Shaanxi is to go from Shaanxi to Gansu to Mongolia, hoping to connect with Russia and communicate with each other. This is probably just the bandits exaggerating their strength. With their remaining troops, they probably do not have this power. However, the people of Shaanxi are eagerly hoping that the central government will eliminate these bandits as soon as possible.</p>
<p>A student movement occurred in Shaanxi a few days ago. It is said that it was incited by members of the Communist Party. However, the military and political authorities in the province immediately took swift action, arresting those who should be arrested and expelling those who should be expelled, responding severely and dissolving all schools above the middle school level. In order to protect themselves, people in all circles in the province often act like silent golden statues. Therefore, it is simply difficult to distinguish between Communist and non-Communist. In conversations, if one makes a slight slip of the tongue, they are either labeled as Communist or as a reactionary element. Living as one of those two carries extreme danger. Therefore, those who know how to protect themselves dare not comment on current affairs. As for the social economy, it is extremely depressed. The land is barren for thousands of miles, and farmers and workers are unemployed. The local officials are mostly military men. The tax collectors are illiterate, do not ask about people's livelihood, and only want silver dollars. One leaves and another comes, but they are all the same. Therefore, the people are unbearably oppressed. Some are dismantling their houses and selling them piecemeal, and some are posting their land deeds outside their doors and scattering them in all directions, each fleeing to save their lives. As for selling wives and children, it is indeed a common occurrence. However, even if one calls someone else "father," they will not care. If they themselves have no way to make a living, who would buy wives and children, inviting trouble for themselves? Shaanxi people are in this tragic and terrifying environment, and their future is dark. It is unknown when they will be able to see a glimmer of dawn.</p>
<p>Even more strange is that, in terms of heavenly and human affairs, there have been two recent events: (1) In the vicinity of Chang'an, within two or three hundred li, there has been a drought. The wells in all villages and communities have been reported to be dry. Every one or two days, the water drawn becomes mud and sand. This is happening everywhere, and it is not a coincidence. Perhaps it is related to the years of severe drought. (2) In various places, the crowing of roosters is heard at dusk. This is also happening everywhere, and everyone hears it together. According to historical records in our country, roosters crowing at unusual times is called "barren roosters" and is considered an ominous sound. The elders in Shaanxi folklore also have an old saying: "The rooster's crow early urges the delivery of grain and grass." At present, Shaanxi people speculate that the rooster's crow at dusk is actually a sign of military disaster. As for the situation in the various villages, it is desolate everywhere. Not a single tree can be seen, because they have all been felled by the troops or disaster victims for fuel. In the past, Zuo Zongtang, when he governed Gansu, ordered that green willows be planted from Tongguan along both sides of the main road, all the way to Lanzhou, for more than two thousand li. The soft branches and green canopy, the orioles singing at dawn, and the crows cawing in the evening were not only lovely scenery but also a blessing to travelers. A certain poet from Guanzhong once wrote a poem: "The road out of Xiaohan has ten thousand branches of willows, and travelers sing the Ode to the Great Wind." How lovely that was! But now, not only is not a single official willow tree left, but also not a single official or private tree in the various villages and towns has survived. It is truly a case of even the trees being in such a state, how can people bear it? But the authorities in Shaanxi turn a blind eye to it. Based on this, the problem of developing the Northwest is probably not easy to realize. (December 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Fujian's New Provincial Government Decides to Ban Opium and Gambling <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>And Has Already Strictly Banned Flower Gambling</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Before the establishment of the new provincial government, it was widely rumored in Fuzhou and Xiamen that opium would be publicly sold and gambling dens would be opened to collect donations to alleviate financial difficulties. Therefore, after the establishment of the new provincial government, people in society paid great attention to these two matters. Opium addicts and gamblers were even more active, hoping to secure the franchise. A few days ago, Lei Shoupeng and Chen Zuguang, members of the Provincial Anti-Opium Association, specifically visited Fan Qiwu, the newly appointed Director of Finance, to inquire about the future anti-opium policy and request the allocation of funds owed to the association to facilitate its work. Fan replied that Chairman Chiang and Director Cai had recently discussed a plan to reorganize Fujian's finances and decided that, no matter how difficult it was, they would never seek military funds from within the scope of anti-opium measures and would absolutely adhere to the principle of complete prohibition. The association could continue to work hard according to this principle, and if there were difficulties or if military assistance was needed, he would do his best to help. He then allocated half a month's worth of funds to the association for its use. At the same time, the provincial government also issued a notice to the governments and public security bureaus of various counties in the provincial capital and northern Fujian, as well as to the commanders of the garrison troops, strictly prohibiting the prevalence of flower gambling, as it not only hindered the livelihood of ordinary people but also disrupted local security, and ordered the arrest of the ringleaders and punishment according to law. The notice stated: "Recently, reports from various sources indicate that flower gambling is prevalent in the villages surrounding the provincial capital and in various villages in northern Fujian, which is extremely detrimental to public morals. It is imperative to strictly investigate and prohibit it in order to curb the gambling trend and rectify public customs. Local administrative organs and garrison troops should assist in the investigation and prohibition, strictly arrest the ringleaders, and punish them according to law, and report back at any time." It is learned that in previous years, every winter, unscrupulous people in various villages would open flower gambling sessions in the mountains, inviting people to guess the results. Each session could collect thousands of yuan if there were many people, and hundreds of yuan if there were few people. The military and police agencies had regulations for collecting fees as protection. Villagers who lost their fortunes and committed suicide due to gambling were not uncommon. This trend is particularly prevalent this year. In the Fuzhu session in the southern countryside of the provincial capital alone, five or six thousand yuan could be collected every day, without interruption from autumn to winter. Everywhere in the city, there are "Ba Zai" [runners], with the foreign firms opened by Taiwanese people acting as the general collection agency. Every evening, groups of three or five people can be seen on the streets and alleys, inquiring about the results of the flower gambling or settling accounts for the wins and losses. After this strict prohibition, the gambling trend may be slightly curbed, and the rumors of opening gambling dens and selling opium may also be eliminated. (December 22nd)</p>

<p>Regarding the bankruptcy of Songjiang Bank, after the county court pronounced its verdict on the 12th of this month, the creditors had many doubts. Yesterday (the 25th) at around 1:00 PM, they convened a creditors' meeting at the law office of Liu Zhimou. More than 70 people attended, including Zhuang Laotai and Shen Youren. Lawyer Qu Yue also attended the meeting. Zhang Zuoliu was elected chairman and Wu Boti was elected recorder. The matters resolved at the meeting were as follows: Regarding the county court's public notice of doubt, it was decided to: (A) Appeal according to law, (B) Petition the Ministry of Justice to investigate and correct the situation, (C) Send representatives to petition the Ministry of Justice. Regarding how to repay the appeal fees that have already been raised, it was decided that this fee will be shared proportionally by each creditor in the future. Regarding various procedural matters, it was decided to continue to request Lawyers Qu and Liu to act as agents.</p>

<p>Due to a conflict between the police and the people, the 13th branch of the Public Security Bureau in Yanqiao Town, Fifth District, caused a town-wide strike, the details of which were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the merchants in Yanqiao Town still resolutely insist on suspending business, and slogans condemning the head of the branch are plastered everywhere. Zhang, the head of the branch, has also presented the offending police officer, Zhang Sanbao, and five others who were detained at the branch to the general bureau. Director Wu personally held a court session and ordered the police officer to return to his post, and Zhang Sanbao and the others were released on bail pending investigation. At the same time, Director Wu issued a handwritten order to Inspector Jin Wuqi to go to the countryside to investigate. After Jin accepted the assignment, he went to the countryside to investigate yesterday morning and returned to the city to report at 6:00 PM in the afternoon. At the same time, Hua Meixuan and other representatives of the people went to the county government to petition. Secretary Liao received them and the representatives stated their grievances and the details of the incident, requesting that Zhang be dismissed and punished. Because the county magistrate has not returned from Shanghai, he replied that Zhang Xin will be replaced after the county magistrate returns to Wuxi. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>

<p>Zhu Bingdie, the main writer for the local newspaper, was falsely accused of being a member of the Communist Party last month. The Capital Gendarmerie Headquarters secretly ordered the 5th Regiment of the Gendarmerie stationed in Wuxi to cooperate with the local county party headquarters and public security bureau to search Zhu's residence in the city's New Field, and planned to arrest Zhu and send him to Nanjing. Because Zhu was in the countryside collecting rent, he was not arrested. Later, the Newspaper Reporters Association petitioned the county party headquarters, proving that Zhu was usually law-abiding and was indeed falsely accused out of malice, requesting that the injustice be redressed. The county party headquarters has already sent a telegram to the Garrison Headquarters and a letter to the 5th Regiment of the Gendarmerie stationed in Wuxi, stating everything. Yesterday, the Gendarmerie Regiment received an order from the Garrison Headquarters to dismiss the case.</p>

<p>The cadre corps of the Jiaxing County Security Regiment has now been fully recruited and has begun training. Zheng Binggeng, the training director of the Security Regiment, was dispatched by the Department of Civil Affairs to inspect the corps in He on the 24th. On that day, 158 members of the county cadre corps, 56 members of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th squads of the district cadre corps, 28 members of the standing corps of the Yue and Wumu townships, and 132 squad leaders were all present for inspection by Director Zheng and County Magistrate Jiang. At that time, the special cadre corps (i.e., the Volunteer Security Regiment run by merchants) was unable to gather for inspection because they were all merchants. Director Zheng immediately took a car to Jiashan that day. After completing the inspection in Jiashan, he will then inspect Haiyan, Pinghu, and other places.</p>

<p>Yesterday, those who sought an audience with Chiang Kai-shek were as follows: At 8:50 AM, Yang Hu, the Director of the Security Bureau, arrived and spoke until 10:20 AM before departing. At 10:50 AM, Zhao Zhiyou, the Mayor of Hangzhou, and at 11:10 AM, Yu Qiaqing, the Chinese Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, arrived, but both were unable to be received due to prior commitments. At 11:30 AM, Huang Shao-xiong, the Minister of Interior, sent in his card and was received by Mi Xi, Chiang's adjutant, who conducted a brief meeting before he left. Subsequently, Mao Bangchu, the Principal of the Aviation School, arrived seeking an audience, as he had heard that Chiang was coming to Hangzhou to give instructions and had a special request. At 11:40 AM, Sun Yuanlang, the Commander of the 88th Division, and Zhang Ming, a member of the Military Affairs Commission, also arrived seeking an audience, but neither was received. Song Ziwen, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan, along with Song Ziliang and Song Zi'an, visited at 12:20 PM and departed at 1:05 PM. In the afternoon, Yang Hu, the Director of the Security Bureau, visited again for half an hour. At 2:40 PM, Chiang Kai-shek left for Hongqiao to visit the grave of Soong's mother, while Tang Shengzhi, a Central Committee member, and Zhu Yaohua, the Commander of the 18th Division, also visited, but did not meet him and returned.</p>

They first went to Nanjing Road on Fourth Avenue to purchase wreaths and fresh flowers before proceeding to Hongqiao Road and arriving at the International Cemetery at 3:20 PM. They walked inside, paid respects at the grave of Soong's mother, bowed, laid flowers, and returned.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Visiting Madame Sun <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>

<p>It has also been learned that Chiang Kai-shek has decided to return to Fenghua from Shanghai today, without detouring to Hangzhou. The Haijun department had originally planned to prepare the Yongsuei warship for Chiang's use, but this has now been changed to the Chuyu warship to escort him to Fenghua.

<h3 id="e66">### Sun Ke Discusses Resisting Violence to Achieve Survival <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>A Shanghai Dispatch from the Shanghai Times News Agency: Yesterday, Sun Ke told reporters that he had not met with Chiang Kai-shek during his visit to Shanghai. He plans to go to Nanjing at the beginning of the New Year to assume his position as President of the Legislative Yuan. Reports that Japan intends to "settle accounts" with the Kuomintang because of the anti-Japanese resolutions passed by the Third Plenary Session are absurd. Although China is de facto conquered today, Japan's atrocities are evident to the world, surpassing even those of Germany before the European war. Universal justice has not disappeared, and there will surely be a day when the world delivers impartial judgment. At this critical moment of survival, we must strive for unity, act in concert as a nation, and resist violence together to achieve survival. If we rely solely on others without self-improvement, we will fall into decline, and who will be willing to support us? Subsequently, when the reporter inquired whether our country had made any military preparations in light of the urgent situation on the Rehe border, Sun replied that the military authorities must have made defensive arrangements. He hoped that the people would rise up to support them so that they could be implemented thoroughly, preventing violence from succeeding.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Following the Rehe Emergency, All Sectors Telegraph Requests for Resistance Against Japan <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Asking Tang Yulin to Swear an Oath to Resist to the Death</p>
<p>Hoping that All Military Personnel Will Voluntarily Enlist</p>
<p>Telegrams from Various Trade Associations: More than 160 trade associations in the city, including the silk industry, mercerized cotton weaving industry, colored printing industry, rice business, coal ash business, north-south goods business, sugar industry, flying flower industry, woolens industry, paper industry, etc., telegraphed Tang Yulin in Rehe yesterday due to the violent Japanese actively invading Rehe, stating: "Most Urgent, Must Arrive Immediately." A message for Chairman Tang Yulin of Rehe: The violent Japanese plot to seize Rehe has long been their ambition. Recently, taking advantage of our national officials' lack of resolve, and using our country's policy of distant friendship and close attack as a pretext, they have invaded the Rehe border. The situation is dire. It is hoped that Your Excellency will swiftly mobilize the army and resist to the death, not becoming a sequel to the three eastern provinces, to show the national sentiment. The survival of the nation is at stake; defending against aggression and saving the country, now is the time. Our associations swear with 120,000 sincere hearts to be your rear support. We are temporarily anxious and eagerly await news of victory. The various trade associations of Shanghai pay their respects, with seal.</p>
<p>Telegram from the National Joint Association for National Salvation: The National Joint Association of National Salvation Organizations telegraphed all military personnel because of the Rehe emergency, stating: (Titles omitted) Last year, the violent Japanese took advantage of our natural disasters to seize the Eastern Provinces. Our troops, responsible for defending the country and guarding its territory, retreated without bloodshed, handing over a vast and beautiful land to the enemy. National sentiment was indignant and boiling over, and international observers were deeply shocked. Fortunately, the righteous army, lacking both weapons and ammunition, fought bitterly with the strong enemy for years, striving for the survival of the motherland, earning the respect of the world. Recently, the defeats of Generals Su Bingwen and Feng Zhanhai were unrelated to this. Looking at the military personnel of the enemy country, who are serving the country, the call for "going to Zhixing and removing Xing" resounded to the skies, causing us great pain. Now that the attitude of the League of Nations is becoming clearer, the violent Japanese are emboldened, their greed insatiable. They are increasing troops to the Rehe border, hoping to swallow North China whole. The gains and losses of Rehe are tied to the survival of our country. Our association now tearfully appeals to all military personnel in the country to voluntarily enlist with the government, send troops to suppress the rebellion, and recover the lost territories. Our people nationwide will pledge our loyalty and be your rear support. The situation is urgent and the danger imminent. We respectfully submit this telegram and eagerly await your service to the country. We await your actions with the greatest anticipation. The Standing Directors of the National Joint Association of National Salvation Organizations, Zhang Junguang, Long Xiangsan, Chen Zhenquan, Dong Mosheng, Zhang Zhiyuan, Xie Naishi, Feng Guo, Tu Liang, etc., pay their respects, with seal.</p>

<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters Convened a Meeting</p>
<p>Li Liejun Drank Bitterly and Composed Poetry</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters held a Yunnan Uprising Commemoration Meeting yesterday at 10:00 AM in the assembly hall on the third floor of the headquarters. Over 300 representatives from various organizations and party headquarters at all levels attended. Committee Member Long Tiyao chaired the meeting, with Zhang Hanyun acting as master of ceremonies. After the meeting was convened as usual, the chairman reported on the significance of the meeting. Subsequently, Committee Member Jiang Huaisu gave a speech on the recent situation of the Northeast Volunteer Army and how to provide effective relief. The original speech was quite long, so it is omitted. The meeting concluded with slogans at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>The Two Road Party Headquarters held a Yunnan Uprising 17th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting yesterday in the assembly hall of the headquarters. Over 80 representatives from various organizations and all staff members signed in, totaling over 80 people. After the meeting was convened as usual, Chairman Wang Cheng reported on the historical facts of the Yunnan Uprising. This was followed by speeches by Tan Gengxin and Zhang Yunhe, whose words were passionate. The meeting then concluded with slogans.</p>
<p>The China Society: Yesterday, to commemorate the Yunnan Uprising, Li Liejun invited dozens of former colleagues from the Second National Protection Army to the China Society, where they discussed the past, full of impassioned songs and shedding many tears. Li stated at the meeting, "It has been sixteen years since Yunnan and Guizhou initiated the uprising against Yuan Shikai. Looking back now, I am deeply moved. Recalling the war against Yuan in the second year of the Republic, Yuan Shikai sent Li Chun, Cao Kun, and Ni Sichong to lead troops south, defeating the anti-Yuan army. After achieving their goals, they went their own way, thinking there was nothing to worry about. Those who worry about the country are always prepared for what is feared, but neglect what is not suspected. Yuan had no way to extend his influence over Yunnan and Guizhou, but the fact that Yunnan and Guizhou were able to initiate the uprising against Yuan had its reasons. Many of those who participated in and went through the uprising can speak about it, and the central government and various provinces have concise reports on the anniversary every year. Since the late Qing Dynasty, many members of the Tongmenghui who studied at military academies were distributed in Yunnan and Guangxi provinces, with Yunnan having even more. At that time, the completion of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the emergency at Pianma caused panic among the people of Yunnan, who were already showing signs of revival. Members of the Tongmenghui served among them and proposed establishing a military academy, primary military school, and physical education school in the provincial capital to gather and educate talented individuals. The revolutionary spirit was thus spread throughout the province. When Li Zhongsheng was the governor of Guizhou and Yunnan, he worked hard on border affairs and was determined to train new troops. New and old talents were still able to be used together, and the foundation of the revolution was thus consolidated. At the same time, a small number of revolutionaries in Guizhou were also planning in secret, and Yunnan and Guizhou became a mutually supportive force. In the sixth year of the Republic, the provinces along the Yangtze River launched an uprising against Yuan. Because Yunnan and Guizhou were unable to participate, their strength was preserved. The financial and social situation was not destroyed, and all party members worked hard to govern the country, as if waiting for the time to arrive. When Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor and sold out the country, the righteous indignation of Yunnan and Guizhou erupted. Those who directly led the matter at that time were Tang Genggeng, Liu Ruzhou, Cai Songpo, as well as Luo Rongxuan, Ren Kecheng, Li Yuegai, Zhou Huangfu, Dai Xunruo, Huang Feizhang, Fang Yunshong, Xiong Jinhan, and Cheng Songyun. Liejun also participated. Those who indirectly helped its success included Liang Rengong, Li Yinquan, Zhang Muxin, Du Yinqing, and Gong Zhenpeng. It cannot be said that all the talented people gathered, but the situation at that time was quite overwhelming. The value of the righteousness of Yunnan and Guizhou lies in its ability to pacify Sichuan in the north, stabilize Guangdong in the east, create a new situation in the southwest, and lay the foundation for the Northern Expedition in later years, completing the situation of the seventeenth year of the Republic. Its relationship is worthy of recording. However, past events are fleeting, and time flies. Recalling the friends who presided over military and political affairs, only Liejun, who is over fifty years old, is still lingering in the world. Foreign troubles are encroaching, and internal worries have not ended. Today's situation is truly beyond what was expected in those years. The first thing to do to save the crisis and seek survival is to unite and resist Japan. However, in order to unite and resist Japan, we must first seek national unity, and implementing national politics quickly is a clear path. Liejun and his friends have repeatedly suggested this to the central government and awakened the people for this reason. Although the National Political Council decided by the Third Plenary Session is almost comical, the National Assembly can still be expected to succeed, bringing it into the constitutional track. It is up to all comrades in the central government to sincerely plan for success, and the people of the whole country must rise up to form political organizations and go to it together." Afterwards, he recited a quatrain to show to the others present, with the poem: "Galloping in splendor, I recall the past, the drums of Yunnan and Guizhou reached the clouds. The sound of righteousness spread far and wide, moving You and Yan. How can we get Tang and Liu to defend the border again?" Zhong Bisheng then followed up with a poem: "How can there be the heroism of that year? Tang and Liu left, leaving it cold and desolate. The common people do not call for the Qin Emperor, but when the border horses are mute, they remember the phoenix feathers. Generously waving the whip, discussing the past, today, the Northeast is startled again. Can the Liaodong boar not lose to the Golden Horse? Why did Tang and Liu also defend the border?" Zhong was the Secretary-General of the Second National Protection Army in those years, and Li Heng described him as Chen Lin. The manifesto against Yuan in those years was written by Zhong, a famous scholar from Guangdong. The next one to follow was Yang Sugeng, with the poem: "The urgent messages are delayed for sixteen years, the troops moved from Yunnan to the Great Wall. In this seat, one drinks the Yellow Dragon, and it is given to the Jade Gate on the desolate border." The next one was Yu Dishan, who composed the poem: "The war has subsided for sixteen years, the Biji and Jinma are dim in the south. The walls of Yuantan are still unharmed, only the brave general is still guarding the border." The next one was Tao Xingru, who composed the poem: "Counting the years, it has been sixteen years, the righteous indignation of that time reached the clouds. If Tang and Liu were still here today, how could they bear to see the eastern neighbors cut off our borders?" The next one was Wu Zhaoxuan, who composed the poem: "Following the whip and stirrup for twenty years, one pillar in the southeast is enough to support the sky. Now the national crisis is even more dangerous, I wish to rise up in the east and defend the border in history." The whole room was filled with a lively atmosphere, and everyone raised their glasses and drank together, no less than the heroism of those years. The gathering only dispersed joyfully at 3:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Public Bond Tickets Were Sent to Shanghai by the Ministry of Finance the Night Before</p>
<p>The Foundation Entrusted the National Products Bank to Handle It</p>
<p>The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, in order to rescue the silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, specially requested the Ministry of Finance to issue 3 million yuan in public bonds. Any silk factory that had stockpiled silk or silkworm cocoons, and had been registered and qualified by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Stockpiled Silk and Silkworm Cocoon Committee, would be given a subsidy of 100 taels per dan when exporting, equivalent to 140 yuan in public bonds. The joint office of the Stockpiled Silk Sales Committee and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Stockpiled Silk and Silkworm Cocoon Committee began operating on the 16th of this month. The public bond tickets were also brought to Shanghai by a special commissioner sent by the Ministry of Finance the night before, and were temporarily kept by the Public Bond Verification Committee of the Ministry of Finance. The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces had previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the silk industry public bonds be issued by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bond Foundation Committee. Yesterday, Zheng Lai, the Director of the Public Bond Department of the Ministry, received a telegram from the Ministry notifying the Foundation Custody Committee, and the Chairman of the Committee, Tai Runqing, and the Standing Committee Member, Ye Zhuotang, claimed the bonds and entrusted the National Products Bank on Third Avenue in the city to issue them on their behalf. Any silk merchants who have already exported stockpiled silk can exchange the subsidy certificate from the Organizing Committee for public bond tickets from today.</p>

<h3 id="e75">The Postal Savings Bureau to Be Merged; Zhu Jiahua's Letter to Wu Tiecheng <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Name Changed and Subordinated to the Postal Administration</p>
<p>Senior Staff to Be Selected from Specialized Talents</p>
<p>Strict Screening and Examination System to Be Implemented</p>
<p>A reporter from the Shen Shi Telegraph Agency visited Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua yesterday and inquired about the merger of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. Mr. Zhu kindly showed a recent letter to Mayor Wu of this city. The details are disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully, Mr. Tiecheng: Previously, the Postal Economic System Research Committee delegated representatives to submit a draft plan for the merger of the Specialized Savings and Remittance Bureau and sought the Ministry's opinion. At that time, due to the beginning of my term and the Ministry of Education not yet handed over, matters were complicated. Moreover, this case is of great importance, and a response could not be given hastily without thorough consideration. Subsequently, after reviewing old files and studying the draft plan along with various opinions and other reference materials, I deeply felt that the key to consolidating the postal foundation lies not in the separation or combination of postal services and savings and remittance but in the need for improvement in both businesses themselves. In the past two years, following the Northeast Incident and the Shanghai War, the national public and private economies have suffered the same difficulties. As a result, the postal service has been hit hard, and the savings and remittance business, which relies on the transfer of its surplus for support, has also been affected. Now, in terms of the improvement that should be sought in the savings and remittance business, what we should pay urgent attention to is how to ensure the safety of savings and make good use of them to seek the interests of depositors, and how to develop the savings and remittance business in order to achieve financial circulation and increase the people's savings strength. This is a fundamental plan. The development of the savings and remittance business can help the postal foundation to be consolidated with its assistance, and the benefits to the country and the people will be even greater. Therefore, in order to enable the savings and remittance business to achieve this mission, two important principles should be implemented in its system: strict supervision and professional development. Since the separation and specialized operation of the savings and remittance business, savings have increased from more than 11 million yuan to more than 27 million yuan, and remittances have increased from more than 13.33 million yuan to more than 16.11 million yuan. It seems that this cannot be said to be the result of moving towards professional development. However, upon examining the actual situation, the scope of savings investment is not strict, and it is almost competing with ordinary commercial banks. This may be the source of criticism. Moreover, since savings are the accumulation of the people's scattered hard-earned money, ensuring safety is the primary task. The current method has not yet been implemented to the best possible level, which is undeniable. However, looking back to the past when they were combined, what was the situation regarding these two important principles? In the past, when post offices handled savings and remittance business, all systems and methods followed everything of the postal service. There were no strict supervision regulations, and those in charge often did not understand financial matters. Most of their savings investments were deposited in foreign banks, purchased foreign stocks and foreign bonds. This was not a comprehensive consideration for the interests of the country and the people. The so-called strict supervision means that accounting must be independent, auditing must be thorough, and examining the scope and nature of capital utilization and whether the collateral is safe and profitable are all extremely important points. The so-called professional development means that savings and remittance business is different from postal business. Savings and remittance belong to the financial nature and are not like postal business, which only requires handling internal work, being quick in handling affairs, and meticulous in procedures. More attention must be paid to the situation in the economic and financial circles. Therefore, the personnel in charge must have financial knowledge and experience, and the management methods must also adapt to the environment and actual conditions of the market. How can it be appropriate to order the post office to handle it completely in a mixed manner? Therefore, in order to consolidate the postal foundation, we should also strive to improve the operation of the savings and remittance business, so that its system has the characteristics of strict supervision and professional development. The reasons and necessity are very obvious. Some commentators often say that in the early years, savings and remittances were not very developed, and it seemed too early to separate and specialize them. This statement is not without merit. However, now that it has been specialized for two years, the scale has been established, and the business has gradually developed. Even if we examine its expenses, it is not as huge as the criticisms claim. If it is suddenly cancelled and restored to the old system, it is inevitable that it will cause too much disturbance and affect the credit of savings and remittances. Moreover, even this is not a truly fundamental consideration. Therefore, the current plan is to urgently improve its system, correct the inadequacies of the past, and establish a permanent and good foundation. On the one hand, a strict supervision system is used to ensure that the interests of the people are truly emphasized and the safety of depositors is protected. On the other hand, its professional development is maintained to make its content sound. At the same time, we should also strive to increase the spirit of cooperation between savings and remittance and postal services in order to achieve mutually beneficial results. After several studies, based on the above principles and spirit, it is planned to change the name of the Postal Savings and Remittance General Bureau to the Postal Savings Bureau and subordinate it to the Postal Department, so that it can be connected and cooperate with the postal business. In terms of personnel and administration, strict laws and regulations will be formulated to establish a good system. Senior staff will be carefully selected from those who have knowledge and experience in the financial business, so that they are all specialized talents in order to achieve the goal of professional development. As for the rest of the middle and lower-level staff, in addition to screening the current staff, an examination system should be adopted in the future. Laws and regulations should also be established for those engaged in postal work to have the opportunity to participate in the examination. The treatment should be guaranteed so that they can work with peace of mind and improve work efficiency. In terms of expenditure, efforts should be made to economize, and those that should be cut should be cut in order to ensure that people are not used in vain and money is not wasted in vain. As for the accounting aspect, at the beginning of the establishment of savings, the accounting was originally independent, and there was a savings name. However, the director of the bureau was concurrently the director of the Postal General Bureau. After the separation, the savings and remittance income was transferred to the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, while in terms of expenditure, all post offices that concurrently handle savings and remittance business had all expenses incurred due to savings and remittance business listed as postal expenses. This is not very consistent with the principle of independent accounting. In the future, the Postal Savings Bureau will be subordinate to the Postal Bureau, and all income and expenditure accounts of savings and remittance business should be set up separately, except that the surplus should be included in the postal accounting general report, so that it is not mixed with postal income and expenditure. The expenses incurred by post offices that concurrently handle savings and remittance business due to savings and remittance should also be verified and borne by the Savings and Remittance Bureau as appropriate. In addition, for the method of strict supervision, it is planned to establish a Postal Savings Supervision Committee. In addition to representatives from the public opinion organs and the Control Yuan, the Accounting Department, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Postal General Bureau, the Ministry of Transportation will also select representatives with outstanding qualifications from several important industrial, commercial, and financial groups. The Ministry will select several people to jointly form a committee to implement effective supervision. The committee will also appoint accountants at any time to review the accounts and publish reports in order to make them public, so as to ensure the safety of savings and make the savings and remittance business sound. In addition, detailed laws and regulations will be strictly formulated to strictly limit the scope and types of savings investment and its amount in order to prevent unexpected risks. All of these are intended to emphasize the principles of strict supervision and professional development, and to achieve the intention of consolidating the postal foundation and increasing the spirit of cooperation in improving the savings and remittance business itself in order to achieve mutually beneficial results. Originally, the postal service and remittance business are both national transportation businesses. The surplus of savings and remittance belongs to the surplus of transportation, and the deficit of the postal service belongs to the deficit of transportation. It is reasonable to use this to support that. Looking at past examples, it is even more evident that if the credit of savings is affected by the dispute over separation and combination of related businesses belonging to the same entity, how can this be the original intention of protecting the postal service and savings and remittance? In short, various businesses have been in a state of decline in recent years, partly due to the dangerous environment and partly due to their own unsoundness. There is nothing that does not need to be reorganized and improved. There is no way to improve that does not require us to sacrifice the spirit of public service beyond the system. My humble opinions on seeking the root of the matter and discussing the matter are honored to be inquired, and I dare to report them. I hope that the committee members of your esteemed society will give me their advice. I wish you all the best. Sincerely, Zhu Jiahua. December 22, 21st year of the Republic.</p>

<p>Requesting Assistance, Which Was Granted, and Undertaking Mediation</p>
<p>The Labor Union Issued a Declaration Explaining the Process</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reported that after the messengers of the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific Telegraph Companies went on strike, the situation became deadlocked. The workers delegated representatives to petition the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Concession and the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council and issued a declaration. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Petitioning the Taxpayers' Association: The striking workers, seeing that the company's attitude was tough and the mediation of the party and government agencies was ineffective, had no choice but to delegate representatives to petition the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession, requesting assistance. They then went to the Municipal Council and requested assistance from Chinese directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and others to avoid unemployment. They were all received and agreed to undertake mediation in order to resolve the situation as soon as possible and avoid affecting social order. As for the company, since it hired Western children to take over the delivery work, it has often been delayed due to unfamiliarity with Chinese characters. For example, Dongjuchang Neiyutai Dongshenzhuang on Sichuan Road and Tongrenchang in the South City have all sent letters to the company criticizing the delays caused by Western children's delivery.</p>
<p>Labor Union's Declaration Seeking Assistance: The Shanghai Third District Foreign Merchants' Telegraph Delivery Industry Workers' Union issued a special declaration yesterday seeking assistance, stating, "Our workers serve in the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific companies. We work hard and dare not slack off. For example, during the January 28th Incident this year, we often went into the dangerous war zone amidst gunfire and within the defense lines of the dwarves. Because there were places where the language was not understood, there were also those who were injured by the Japanese soldiers' gun butts, but there was nowhere to complain, so we had to endure it in our hearts. All telegrams were delivered as usual without any obstruction, so that the company's business could develop. However, the capitalists did not give any rewards, but instead despised our workers and did not think about the dangerous and laborious achievements. They used cunning methods to oppress the workers. If the workers made any mistakes, they would be fired immediately. For example, in November this year, the number eight messenger of the Great Northern Company was occasionally ill. The company did not allow him to take leave. He personally delivered telegrams to nearby places, but it was difficult to support the faraway ones. He entrusted the Great Eastern Company to deliver a telegram on his behalf and mistook the door number ten, which happened to be the residence of the Great Northern Company's manager. He was immediately reprimanded. After sending it accurately and returning to the company, the manager reported it to the general manager, who immediately fired the number eight messenger. The workers believed that the mistake of mistaking the door number was very minor. Why should he be fired? The workers begged the general manager twice to reinstate him. If there were other mistakes in the future, he could be fired, but the capitalists insisted on the imperialist policy and resolutely refused. Thinking about this situation, the capitalists are completely using oppressive methods to treat the workers. In recent years, postal services, customs, and railways are all transportation agencies. The wages and benefits enjoyed by the workers are generous and can barely provide food and clothing, while the telegraph is also one of the transportation agencies, but its wages are comparatively very different, and it is difficult to maintain a livelihood. The workers consulted each other and made nine requests to the capitalists on November 25, but the company first accepted and then reneged, and then perfunctorily. The workers urged repeatedly, but there was no sincere response. Our workers could not bear it and were forced to go on strike on the 20th of this month, hoping that the company would realize it. However, the capitalists still used tough methods to treat the workers, intending to destroy them and wanting to put all the members of our union in a desperate situation. Representatives were sent to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate, but it was ineffective. The capitalists are really said to be ignorant of human feelings. Our workers are suffering from this environmental oppression under the clear blue sky and bright sun. It is very painful! We beg the labor unions of all circles to give public assistance so that the workers of our union can have a glimmer of glory and the labor unrest can be resolved. Then all the workers of our union will be infinitely grateful! A declaration by all the workers."</p>
<h3 id="e82">The County Government Sent a Letter Requesting the Bean and Rice Industry to Donate Grain Reserves <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Rice Industry Association of this city received a letter from the county government yesterday, which stated, "Regarding the excessively low price of rice, which is harmful to people's livelihood, we urgently need to provide relief. The only way to provide relief is to dredge the rice supply and establish grain reserves. The government has already established measures for dredging the rice supply. The establishment of grain reserves is of great importance. The people's livelihood in this county is declining, and public funds are exhausted, making it difficult to proceed. We intend to request your association to advocate, in addition to benefiting merchants, to donate funds for grain reserves in this county on an annual basis to benefit people's livelihood. This is not a small matter. We should communicate this to you, hoping that you will investigate and consider the matter and reply. We are deeply grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e83">Record of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Jiangsu Rice Federation <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Ninghu City and County Rice Industry Association Federation held the fourteenth meeting of the second session of the executive and supervisory committees at Cuixiu Hall at 3 pm yesterday. The members present were Li Zhongchen, Qian Jingsheng, Lu Zhuqing, Zhao Zixin (representing Ren Xunxian), Gong Zhaoming, Chen Junyu, Yan Xiaoquan, Zhu Zhaoxi, Zhu Zixiang, and others, totaling nine people. Zhu Zixiang was publicly elected as chairman. After performing the rituals, the chairman reported that the previous telegram requesting the provincial government to quickly circulate rice to alleviate the suffering of farmers in Jiangsu has now received approval from the provincial government No. 2337, stating, "We have received your telegram. After investigation, the provincial government's 551st committee meeting decided to allow the temporary sale of rice and wheat out of the province. However, it must be submitted by the county government and transferred to this government for the issuance of a passport for investigation. Passports will not be charged. If they are transported out of the province without a passport, they will still be punished according to the regulations. Please be informed." Following this, there was a discussion on the case of whether the rice industry peers in Shanghai City should implement a new system of measuring instruments starting next year and whether peers in the interior should consult in advance. It was decided to hold the next standing committee meeting early for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e84">The Overseas Chinese Federation Welcomed Returning Overseas Chinese <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>A 72-Year-Old Man Is Willing to Fight the Japanese</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation held three special committee meetings at 2 pm yesterday to separately deliberate on the new charter, the establishment methods of the Overseas Chinese Club, and various preparations related to the election of new directors. At 4 pm, a tea party was held in the hall of the association to welcome returning overseas Chinese Zhang Wenbing, Chen Bingsan, Ding Hongnan, and Xu Youfan. Zhang Wenbing is a major mine owner from Selangor, British Malaya. Chen Bingsan is the former secretary-general of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Group in Luzon. Ding Hongnan is the principal of the Sentaro Chinese School in the Philippines. Xu Youfan is the president of the Burmese Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. First, Chairman Xu (Jigong) and Secretary-General Huang (Jianzhong) gave welcoming speeches and reported on the association's affairs. Then, Zhang Wenbing talked about his work upon returning to China, saying that he is an overseas Chinese from Guangdong and a 72-year-old man who operates tin mines in Malaya with more than 20,000 workers. Currently, due to the very bad economic situation, the workers will lose their jobs. He returned to China to discuss with the government to move these 20,000 workers to the three northeastern provinces to reclaim wasteland. Before he arrived in China, the three northeastern provinces had already fallen into the hands of the enemy, so he discussed with the Nanjing government to choose a location near the three northeastern provinces to reclaim wasteland and arm themselves against Japan. The government expressed its approval. After returning to Shanghai, he inspected Songhu, where there was war everywhere, leaving not a tree or a blade of grass, which was really heartbreaking. He said this with tears in his voice, and the audience was moved. Zhang then said that there are tens of thousands of young people and veterans in Guangdong who are willing to go to the customs to kill the enemy, but they have no travel expenses and there is nothing they can do. The rich people of our country should have considerable feelings. After he returns to Malaya, he will find a way to send this batch of workers back to China. This old man is also willing to go to the customs with the strong men to kill the enemy. With only a few years left in his old age, it is time to risk his life at this time. Even if he dies, he is willing to die under the guns of the dwarfs. Then, Chen Bingsan reported that there are more than 100 national salvation groups in the Philippines, with 130,000 overseas Chinese. The workers donated very enthusiastically to the volunteer army, borrowing money and saving household expenses to donate voluntarily. In less than ten days, they reached more than 50,000 yuan. In three weeks, they donated tens of thousands of yuan for air defense. There are many overseas Chinese who love the country, but there are also many shameless traitors who are rich and powerful and live comfortably. The young people are angry at their shamelessness, so they secretly formed assassination groups and bloodbath groups to eliminate these scums. In legal terms, many lawsuits are lost for detaining Japanese goods, so they adopted other boycott methods. Chinese businessmen in various places successively sued traitors in batches, making the traitors exhausted. This method is quite effective. We should thank the Philippine customs and the Filipinos. They have helped us a lot in our work to resist Japanese goods. Xu Youfan and Ding Hongnan also reported the overseas Chinese situation in various places in detail, which is omitted. More than 50 people attended the meeting that day and dispersed happily at 6 pm.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Colonel Hawke of the U.S. Passes Away Suddenly in Zhejiang <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Friends Express Regret</p>
<p>Colonel Hawke, commander of the Fourth Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, went out to buy Christmas items the morning before yesterday (the 23rd). He was in good spirits and showed no signs of illness. He returned to his residence at 927 Avenue Joffre before noon for lunch, then began wrapping gifts for children. Suddenly, his heart failed, and he died instantly. Colonel Hawke was born in California, USA, in 1877. He served in the Marine Corps for 32 years. In October 1930, he was promoted to commander of the Fourth Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai. He was respected by his subordinates and was particularly devoted to public welfare. He had a wide circle of friends. Therefore, when the news of his death spread, Chinese and foreign friends expressed their regret. The date of the funeral has not yet been determined, as it is necessary to await instructions from Washington.</p>

<p>Shanghai Telegraph Bureau to Implement on New Year's Day</p>
<p>Telephone Numbers to Replace Names and Addresses</p>
<p>In order to improve the speed and reduce the cost of sending telegrams in various places, the Ministry of Communications had previously drafted a plan to use the recipient's installed telephone number as their name and address, thereby reducing the number of characters and saving on telegraph fees. It is now learned that this measure has been approved by Minister Zhu Jiahua and has been circulated to telecommunications agencies under his jurisdiction to implement it in accordance with local conditions. It is reported that the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications in this city, the Shanghai Radio General Station, and the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau have decided to implement it starting on New Year's Day next year. However, if the recipient has not installed a telephone, the procedure will remain the same to ensure delivery.</p>

<p>United Relief Association of Shanghai Charities Has No Funds Available</p>
<p>The United Relief Association of Shanghai Charities for Disaster Relief of Northeastern Refugees received a telegram from the Tianjin National Survival Society, stating: "It has been found that there are already thousands of Northeastern youths who have lost their schooling in Tianjin and Peiping. It is proposed to establish a National Crisis Industrial Arts Society, which will not only provide relief to refugees but also develop industrial and commercial enterprises, offset foreign goods, and restore our rights. This is truly a move with multiple benefits. If approved, please allocate 130,000 yuan from the funds raised by Special Envoy Kong Xiangxi and send personnel to supervise the use of funds to ensure accountability. Otherwise, first allocate 60,000 yuan to open a pencil factory, and other funds can be allocated in installments to complete the project gradually," and so on. It is reported that the association has replied by telegram, stating that the current fundraising for disaster relief of Northeastern refugees has been greatly affected by the commercial depression and financial stagnation. The funds raised have been very meager. The funds currently being distributed are being advanced by the united charitable organizations. No funds have been received from Special Envoy Kong's fundraising. The request is impossible to grant.</p>

We have received a reply stating: "To whom it may concern, we received your letter this morning, along with a check from the Silk Industry Bank for 20,000 yuan.

For the sake of helping Northeastern refugees, the remaining association added a beauty treatment to the venue. After scientific cosmetic surgery, elderly people with white hair can return to their youth. It is heard that this cosmetic surgery was originally priced at 5 yuan per person for each treatment, but in order to give preferential treatment to visitors to the variety show, the price has been reduced to 1 yuan per person.

<p>A Bailiff Jumps Down to Chase</p>
<p>But Sprains His Ankle</p>
<p>Hu Zhaoyu, a native of Wuxi, was detained by the Shanghai Local Court for a rape case in Shanghai. Because he appealed, the court dispatched bailiff Wang Benchu on the 24th of this month (the day before yesterday) to escort the criminal on the 7:30 a.m. fourth-class train to Suzhou. When the train traveled about five or six li from Nanxiang Station, the criminal suddenly wanted to defecate. The bailiff escorted him to the toilet and monitored him. However, the toilet of the fourth-class train was equipped like an ordinary train station toilet, so its height was parallel to the window. Unexpectedly, the criminal intended to escape and took the opportunity to jump out of the window. Because his body was agile, as if he had been trained in sports or martial arts, he ran away as soon as he jumped down. The bailiff saw this and immediately leaned over to grab him, but it was too late. The bailiff immediately handed over four large packages of files, three official letters, and his own hat to the ticket inspector for safekeeping, and then immediately jumped down, resulting in a sprained ankle. However, he was already four or five li away from the place of escape. The bailiff immediately chased after him with all his might, but has not yet caught him. All files and official letters have been handed over by the Nanxiang Station staff to the First Section Railway Police Department for safekeeping. Yesterday, the Police Department telephoned the court to report the situation and requested that personnel be sent to retrieve the files.</p>

<p>And Comes Out of the Room in Response</p>
<p>Four Kidnappers Were Arrested</p>
<p>And Another Girl Was Rescued</p>
<p>Deng Baozi, the six-year-old son of Guo Hongming, a vegetable vendor from Jiangbei who lives at No. 12 Xixiang Lane, Lafayette Road, in the French Concession, was abducted by bandits at the Tangjiawan vegetable market on the 12th of this month and hidden in the home of a Yangzhou woman, Shi Jiang, on the upper floor of No. 30, Orre Road. That afternoon, Guo struck a foot stove cover to search for him and shouted the child's name along Orre Road. Deng Baozi heard the sound and escaped. Father and son met, and after inquiring about what had happened, they reported it to the police station. The police sent detectives to arrest kidnapper Shi Jiang, Shi Chen, and suspected accomplices Tian Qigui and Jiang Yin, and also rescued another abducted six-year-old girl, Chen Amao. The detectives investigated and confirmed that the girl was Chen Ai Jin, the daughter of Mr. Chen of Pike Road, and that she had been renamed after being abducted. They issued a notice for her to be claimed. The kidnappers were escorted to the Second Special District Court, where the police lawyer filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law. After the interrogation was completed, Shi Jiang and Shi Chen were ordered to await sentencing. Tian Qigui and Jiang Yin were released on the grounds of no involvement in the case. On the day of sentencing the day before yesterday, Judge Li Changnian presided over the case and sentenced Shi Jiang to three years and six months of imprisonment for the crime of hiding men and women under the age of twenty who were abducted for profit, and Shi Chen (for the same crime) to two years and six months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Christmas, the fourth feast of the Catholic Church. Chinese and French Catholics went to the Catholic Church outside the New North Gate at midnight the night before to attend the midnight Mass with the priests. Yesterday morning, bishops and others held a grand feast. French consuls and other officials and gentry went to the church to observe the ceremony. The front of the church was crowded with people and vehicles all day long, and it was very lively. The Emre Road Police Station, fearing that the congestion of vehicles would obstruct traffic, specially sent Chinese and foreign police officers to take care of it. The French Consulate, the Public Works Bureau, and the French General Police Department all had a day off. Because the day happened to be a Sunday, they will have an extra day off today. The criminal public prosecution cases of the Second Special District Local Court today are suspended for one day because the police department is on vacation. Private civil and criminal cases will still be heard as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Unfortunate Incident Before Christmas: American Newspaper Reporter Gray Commits Suicide <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Body Found in the Alley of the National City Bank</p>
<p>It is Still Unclear Whether He Jumped from the Building or Fell by Mistake</p>
<p>The Letter He Left Behind Suggests He Committed Suicide</p>
<p>Gray Has a Long History in Journalism</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the body of a Westerner was suddenly found in the alley in the southwest corner of the National City Bank on the Fourth Avenue yesterday morning (the 24th). It was learned that he was Gray, a veteran of the newspaper industry, who had been in Shanghai for six months and resided in the National City Bank. Later, they went to Gray's residence on the fourth floor of the bank and found that everything was in order, with no signs of disorder. There were two letters left on the table, one addressed to the U.S. Consulate General and one addressed to the National City Bank Boarding Committee, both typewritten. The letter to the U.S. Consulate General reportedly mentioned the disposition of the estate. The circumstances suggest that he committed suicide. The reason for his suicide and the truth behind it will probably be revealed when the U.S. Procuratorate opens the trial on the 28th. The deceased went to Honolulu twenty years ago and served as a telegraph editor for the Honolulu Broad Knowledge Newspaper. Later, he went to Hilo Island to found the Maiyi News, serving as editor and publisher. He sold it just a year ago and went to Manila to join the Manila Newspaper, but soon came to Shanghai as a semi-retired resident, residing at the National City Bank for six months. He had been suffering from heart disease for some time and his eyesight was also declining. It is not known why he suddenly became tired of the world. Whether he jumped from the building and committed suicide or fell by mistake is still unclear. However, the police and U.S. authorities believe it was suicide based on his letter. After the discovery yesterday morning, they immediately reported it to the U.S. authorities. U.S. Prosecutor Salede, Judge Creswell, and Coroner Bode went to the scene of the incident.</p>
<p>After examining the body and asking a few questions, they ordered it to be transported to the International Funeral Home for burial.</p>

<p>The Price of Food Rice Exceeds the Market Price by More Than Ten Yuan per Dan</p>
<p>President Shen Believes There Is Obvious Inflation</p>
<p>There Are Also Suspicious Alterations in the Rice Shop's Ledgers</p>
<p>The Branch Superintendent Was Temporarily Detained After Being Interrogated</p>
<p>Since the accounting affairs of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court were merged with those of the Second Branch Court of the Jiangsu Higher Court under the order of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, all financial revenues and expenditures have been handled by the Second Branch Court. President Shen Jiayi of the court has a reputation for being energetic and capable in the judicial field. Now, he must personally audit the entry and exit of various funds to determine approval or rejection. A few days ago, Warden Lu of the Second Branch Prison of Jiangsu applied to the court for prison rations, and the price of rice was more than ten yuan higher per dan. President Shen believed that the current market price of white rice was no more than ten yuan per shi, and the warden had obviously inflated the price and was not clean. He immediately sent Warden Lu and the prison's general affairs officer to the Prosecutor's Office of the First Special Court. Chief Prosecutor Wang opened the court for interrogation one evening last Friday and temporarily detained them. The prosecuting prosecutor summoned the owner of a rice shop selling rice to the court for questioning on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (Saturday). The shop's ledger was also brought to the court. Under interrogation, it was found that there were suspicious alterations in the ledger. Therefore, the shop owner was ordered to post bail and await investigation.</p>

<p>More Than 800 Pieces Are Available for Those in Need to Claim from the Association</p>
<p>The Zhabei War Zone Disaster-Stricken Industry and Commerce Federation, due to the sudden Shanghai Incident on January 28, the war-torn people escaped naked under the fire, and none survived. Now, most of the houses have been destroyed by artillery fire, resulting in displacement. At this time of winter, they are suffering from hunger and cold. The sight of sorrow is heart-wrenching. Therefore, the special commissioners have been going to the areas more severely affected by the disaster in recent days to distribute cotton clothes, of which more than 800 pieces have been issued. Those in need can claim them from the association. Rice is also being planned.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Petition from the China Commoners' Association <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Limit the Time to Use Domestically Produced Clothing</p>
<p>Please Establish Women's Uniforms</p>
<p>Cheng Yu, the initiator of the China Commoners' Association, submitted a petition to the Third Plenary Session, requesting that all government officials and people in charge of military and academic circles be required to switch to domestically produced clothing within a limited time, and that a women's uniform style be promulgated and implemented nationwide. The tone was extremely serious. The original manuscript is recorded below: "Because cloth, silk, millet, and soybeans are indispensable to the people every day, and clothing, food, housing, and transportation, the word 'clothing' is the first thing advocated by the Premier. It is regrettable that there is still no practical solution. Looking at the meeting places everywhere, those wearing Western clothes, from head to toe, are all foreign goods. Among those wearing Chinese clothes, very few use completely domestic goods for their outer and inner garments. As for women in the middle and upper classes of society, none seen on the road wear clothes made entirely of domestic goods. This kind of extravagant and luxurious situation is very alarming. At a glance, it can be seen that it is an unorganized country, which does not need to be said by foreigners. Reports state that Japanese goods worth 140 million yuan came to China in September, mainly silk and cotton fabrics, cotton yarn, and rayon. Another report from Japanese merchants states that the shipment of Japanese goods to China has exceeded that of Britain and the United States. In the item of fabrics, Japan accounted for one-third this time, with more than 165,000 pieces. It is also reported that Japanese goods imported to the Yangtze River area last month reached 50,000 to 60,000 tons, with fabrics accounting for the majority. According to Japanese merchants, from December to January, surplus goods worth 50 million yuan will be sold throughout China. The Japanese Qing Shipping Company has already increased the number of ships to transport them. Another report states that more than 800 Russian overseas Chinese in Tianjin are engaged in the cloth industry. Russian standard foreign cloth sells well in provinces, counties, towns, and villages in North China. According to Japanese newspapers, Russia's five-year plan has been completed, and it will dump goods abroad at the lowest prices. Japanese goods will be greatly affected, and even airplanes and cannons cannot reverse the anti-Japanese goods trend. The economic war is most terrifying. Therefore, they are very panicked. However, the Tianjin telegram in the Chinese newspaper stated that Chinese merchants were very happy to see the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia and discussed purchasing Russian goods to replace Japanese goods when the goods arrive in China. Now, I respectfully submit various newspapers and ask you to review them. To resist foreign goods is one thing, and to promote domestic goods is another. To resist foreign goods, we should stop them with strength, and to promote domestic goods, we should proceed with strength. In recent years, our country has not failed to talk about promoting domestic goods, but there is only discussion and no action. The reason is that people's hearts are dead, and there is nothing we can do. Now, I plan to ask the government to implement the important conditions of the Three Principles of the People, starting with the word 'clothing' in the easiest to implement aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. That is, to strictly define the method immediately. All government officials and people in charge of military and academic circles must switch to domestically produced clothing starting from January next year (old-fashioned non-Chinese goods can be worn at home until they are worn out). If it cannot be done in January, then February; if it cannot be done in February, then March. If it cannot be done in March, then they will never change. Then, those in charge will be dismissed or removed from their positions. The momentum must be vigorous and resolutely handled. Government officials and military leaders should set an example and encourage each other at any time. As for the clothing of women in our country today, it is extremely strange. In summer, it cannot cover the body, and in winter, it cannot keep out the cold. At a glance on the road, it can be seen. Therefore, please stipulate a uniform, with lengths and sizes that must not be violated. Any modern women who encounter violence will not be protected by the law. Otherwise, what is the meaning of propriety, justice, integrity, and shame? In short, our country is in a state of backward production today, and the economy has completely collapsed. If we do not make a painful determination and vigorously reform, we will never be able to recover. Look at India. No matter what class of people, they all wear coarse cloth made in their own country and engage in civil movements. Their patriotism is like this. Why are the descendants of our gentry not as good as black people and as foolish as fish? Although the words are sharp, there is no other intention. If you are willing to investigate, China will be fortunate." Cheng Qing lives at No. 21, Xin Chang Li, Xin Zha, Shanghai.</p>

<p>Directors and Supervisors Elected on the Spot</p>
<p>To promote the insurance business of Chinese merchants, the trade associations of this city, together with leaders of various industries, specially organized the General Management Office of Insurance for Various Industries. Yesterday, a preparatory meeting was held at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.

<p>Results Exceed the Planned Goal</p>
<p>The 32nd Shanghai YMCA Fundraising Campaign closed at 8 p.m. on the 24th. The goal of this campaign was 50,000 yuan. In the first three announcements, only half of the goal was achieved. However, in the last three days, the general captain, Mayor Wu, and the deputy general captains, Shi Liangcai and Rong Zongjing, made every effort to call on the captains and members of each team to cooperate and forge ahead, and they jumped to exceed the goal. Among them, the one who made the most effort was the captain of the fourth team, Mr. Wen Hongen, who won the championship. Although the ranks of the teams of Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, Li Yuanxin, and Lin Kanghou were different, the scores were very close, and they all exceeded the goal. In this year's extremely panic-stricken economy, and in the autumn of tight year-end funds, the fact that the fundraising campaign of the association achieved such results shows the concern of the social community for the association and the needs of the association for social affairs. The total score of the association is attached as follows: (1) Mr. Wen Hongen, captain of the fourth team, obtained 6,147 points; (2) Mr. Wang Xiaolai, captain of the tenth team, obtained 5,711 points; (3) Mr. Pan Gongzhan, captain of the first team, obtained 5,543 points; (4) Mr. Li Yuanxin, captain of the second team, obtained 5,492 points; (5) Mr. Lin Kanghou, captain of the third team, obtained 5,000 points; (6) Mr. Qian Xinzhi, captain of the seventh team, obtained 4,030 points; (7) Mr. Cao Yunxiang, captain of the eighth team, obtained 3,204 points; (8) Mr. Qin Yuqing, captain of the ninth team, obtained 2,679 points; (9) Mr. Guo Shun, captain of the fifth team, obtained 1,518 points; (10) Mr. Zhong Ketuo, captain of the sixth team, obtained 1,050 points.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Verdict on the Xia Family Guanyin Temple Property Case <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Unauthorized Disposal is Inappropriate</p>
<p>Failure to Prove Rejection is Upheld</p>
<p>The temple committee of Xia Family Guanyin Temple (now Pengnan Elementary School) on Qiujiang Road West, Zhabei, previously sued Lu Chaomian, a member of the committee, for donating the land base of the Guanyin Temple and the grain certificates to Shanghai College of Law, which caused disputes among other temple directors. Both parties hired lawyers and litigated in the Shanghai District Court for a long time. It is now known that the land base of the temple property was purchased and built by the female nun Gu Quan of the Guanyin Temple from Zhuang Dejiu and Ma Yuanji during the third year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, the name of the grain certificate account in the third year of Guangxu was still Zhuang and Ma, and the grain certificate after the fourth year of Guangxu was changed to Xia Family Guanyin Temple. It is unknown how the land certificate and grain certificate were handed over to Lu Chaoxiu for safekeeping. The female nun died of illness in the nineteenth year of Guangxu, and afterwards, the temple directors entrusted the abbot monk to manage it. However, Shi Mingjing also passed away in the sixth year of the Republic of China, so there is no way to prove it. Therefore, the court's judgment stated that the defendant (referring to Lu Chaoxiu) was unqualified. He privately disposed of public welfare property, which was inappropriate. However, it is impossible to prove whether the plaintiff has the right to sue. Anyone who sues the current occupant for ownership should present reliable evidence to prove the truth of their claim. If the plaintiff cannot provide proper proof, the current state of possession should be maintained and the plaintiff's request should be rejected. The plaintiff in this case cannot prove the source of the land in question and the fact that the certificate was handed over to the defendant, so the plaintiff's lawsuit is without reason, and a judgment is made as the main text. The plaintiff's lawsuit is dismissed, and the litigation costs are borne by the plaintiff. It is also heard that the temple directors said that this temple is the public property of more than 500 households in the area, so they refused to accept the first-instance judgment and will file an appeal.</p>

<p>Two Sampans are Damaged at the Same Time</p>
<p>An Old Woman and a Young Girl Fall into the Sea</p>
<p>The Ningbo-class ship Ningxing, which departed from Shanghai at 5:50 p.m. the day before yesterday, arrived at Wusong. At that time, there was a heavy fog. The ship wanted to avoid two importing ships, causing the bow to crash into the stone pier on the east Bund of Songjiang Town. The pier and two sampans of Lu Sanlang parked next to the pier were damaged, and Sanlang's mother (over seventy years old) and Sanlang's niece Jinbao, 20 years old, were knocked into the sea. Fortunately, nearby sampans rescued them. After causing the accident, the Ningxing ship was stuck in the shallows and lost its ability to sail. It quickly hung two red life-saving lights to ask for help. Li Lisheng, the manager of Wusong Maoxing Towing Company, caught sight of it and sent two small towing boats to tow the Ningxing out of danger. At that time, the Zhanghuabang River Management Office also heard the news and rushed a small boat to the scene. After Deputy River Manager verified that the Ningxing ship was not damaged, it was ordered to sail out of port and go straight to Ningbo. However, it was delayed in Songjiang for more than two hours, so it was anchored at eight o'clock.</p>

<p>The Hongkou Grand Hotel on North Sichuan Road, Shanghai, closed down after the January 28th Incident. The waiters in the hotel department have not been dismissed yet. The hotel originally had more than 100 waiters, each with a cash guarantee. It has been a year since the incident. The workers' representatives have repeatedly asked the capitalists to dismiss the waiters early and return the cash guarantees. The person in charge of the capitalists initially made excuses for sorting out the accounts, then agreed on a date for resuming business, and finally mediated, but there was no sincerity. This caused great dissatisfaction among all the workers. Yesterday, the workers held a meeting and publicly elected representatives to petition the business community, requesting assistance from Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Wang Binyan, and other celebrities, and to uphold justice. The petition representatives also described the various hardships of the workers' environment, pleading that the workers were all working in other places, and the losses were huge and the pain was deep. Moreover, it was in the cold winter, and it was difficult to maintain a livelihood. It is said that Yu Wang and others have agreed to mediate.</p>

His encounter was a new record in the driver's world. Unexpectedly, the ship's business was sluggish, with accumulated losses, and it was difficult to maintain. He recently resigned and hired a lawyer to sue Yang in the First Special District Court for obstructing his freedom. He said that Yang's sixteen-year-old younger sister, Fazeng, wanted to marry him, but because he was of lowly occupation, Yang's sister asked Yang's mother and Yang to borrow 10,000 yuan from him to obtain the comprador position. Unexpectedly, on the night of February 28 of this year, Yang suddenly ordered two strong men to forcibly take away the photos and love letters given to him by Yang Fazeng. Yang broke his promise, not only refusing to marry his sister to him, but also cutting off the economic assistance for the steamboat comprador position, causing him to be unable to repay his debts. The court had held two hearings, and the defendant Yang Fansheng completely denied the accusations. His lawyer also defended him, saying that the date of the crime alleged by the plaintiff was before the promulgation of the amnesty decree. Even if there were such facts, it would be exempted under the amnesty regulations. The presiding judge announced the verdict in the afternoon the day before yesterday. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant was present. Judge Liu then acquitted Yang Fansheng. The outside world regards it as the second Huang Lu case, which has now come to an end.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Prerequisite Issues for Improving Rural Education <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>| Letter from Mr. Zhang Tianbai |</p>
<p>(Regarding the discussion of the "Rural Education Problem" raised by Mr. Bao Zuxuan, Mr. Bao's original letter can be found in this column on the 23rd of this month)</p>
<p>The "Rural Education" problem raised by Mr. Bao Yixuan is indeed an important one. However, my attitude towards Mr. Bao's raising of this issue must first be discussed before addressing the nature of the so-called rural problem. Mr. Bao said, "...the notion of breaking the current economic structure is somewhat overly ambitious." Then he said, "...the pressing problems at hand must be resolved immediately." This is the "metaphysical ghost" of Hu Shi's pragmatism speaking through Mr. Bao. In Mr. Bao's view, the pressing problem at hand is not the transformation of China's entire social and economic structure (in fact, for rural areas, it would be better to say "the relationship of land ownership"), but rural education. Here's a good analogy: you go to a working-class district in Shanghai, grab an unemployed worker, and tell him, "Your problem isn't that you're unemployed, don't have a job, and don't have food to eat, but that you haven't received an education. Wait a moment while we promote workers' education." We can guess with our eyes closed what the worker would answer you: "Please stop! Please stop!" Let me tell you honestly, the most urgent problem in rural areas right now isn't education or illiteracy, and it's certainly not, as great men say, promoting "filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, and integrity," but rather the extremely rapid and widespread bankruptcy of rural areas. In other words, the transformation of rural economic relations is the most urgent problem "at hand." As for rural education, it's not the pressing problem of peasants who are starving, becoming thieves, selling their wives and children, and becoming displaced. This is the urgent problem that we, the bookworms sitting in foreign-style houses in concessions, with at least clothes to wear and food to eat, have fantasized about in our minds. What Mr. Bao said puts the cart before the horse, and this is the first point. Mr. Bao said, "...theoretical insights must also take into account reality." Ha! This is the same metaphysical ghost playing tricks again! If you pay a little attention to Chinese newspapers that don't pay much attention to rural issues, you can understand that peasant movements in various provinces, such as the peasants in Yangzhou besieging the county seat, the large-scale riots of peasants in Lingbi County, etc., have already universally and urgently brought rural economic issues, that is, agricultural issues, to the agenda. Mr. Bao still says it's "overly ambitious"! Then our Mr. Bao's "high and far" is truly unfathomable! Mr. Bao also said that it "must take into account reality," meaning that the transformation of the "rural economy" has not yet become a reality, which is even "higher" and "farther"! "Nothing could be added!" This is the second point. We know that "education is a department of the entire political system" (Shen Bao, December 23rd, Current Affairs Commentary), and politics is the superstructure of the social and economic structure. If we only talk about political reform and ignore the transformation of the economic structure, then it is "seeking cooperation with a tiger," and it can also be said that "when the skin is gone, what will the fur attach to?" If we only talk about education and ignore the fundamental problems of politics and the fundamental transformation of the economy, then it is even more "ignoring the root and focusing on the branches"! Even more of a "castle in the air"! Doing the utopian dream of reformism! I am not saying that rural education cannot be done, nor am I saying that we should only pay attention to the transformation of politics and the economy and not pay attention to the issue of "popularizing education," but rather that without fundamental transformation of the economic structure and without considerable clarity in politics, any "popularization of education" or "rural education" is just black characters written on white paper, nothing but deceiving people! Having said this, the article is already quite long, so I will temporarily offer this for public discussion. I will come back another day to discuss the practical issues of "rural education."</p>
<h3 id="e116">How Should I Maintain This Dangerous Family? <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>| Letter from Ms. Chen Xu Jingrong |</p>
<p>My husband is a small businessman, very skilled in commercial knowledge. Although his feelings for me cannot be said to be twelve points good, they are still harmonious. From marriage until now, for several years, our love has never been broken. In the third year after we got married, we separated from the family and established our own household. Later, we had a child who is just three years old this year. However, unfortunately, our family's economic situation was already very difficult, and at this moment, my husband suddenly became unemployed! When the news came, I almost wanted to commit suicide! However, because of my husband, I remained calm. Instead, I constantly thought of various things to say to persuade my husband, giving him spiritual comfort, and even being more considerate of him than before, consulting him with a smile on my face in everything. In this way, unknowingly, another eight months passed, and our daily life almost entirely depended on borrowing money. Later, my husband really had no heart to stay at home "waiting for a rabbit," so he went out to look for work. However, how easy is that? He has been out for four months now and still hasn't made any progress. In those four months, he wrote back four letters home. The tone of the letters was either discouraged and pessimistic, or some veiled allusions to suicide. This situation is really extremely dangerous! Our family really can't be maintained anymore! Sir, how should I deal with this dangerous family? I thought about working as a maid for someone else's family, but in our poor and remote countryside, who would want you? Besides, even if I got a job, what would I do with my three-year-old child? Leave him at home? Then this desolate environment would definitely make my husband even more pessimistic. I absolutely don't want that! Sir, what should I do? Please guide me with your rich experience!</p>
<p>Reply: Ms.'s letter is indeed a tragic and painful cry under the tight pressure of the current society. And this cry is not just the cry of Ms. herself, but the cry of many, many "masses"! From this, we can smell a lot of blood! However, Ms. wants us to think of a way to "guide" her, which is very difficult, because Ms.'s pain is the pain of the "masses." We cannot abandon the "masses" and only think of a "way" for Ms. This, we must ask Ms. to forgive! Here, we can only ask Ms. and your husband to "endure and cope" with it. | Being able to fight against evil forces is good! "Suicide" will not only not solve the problem but will also increase the pain. A smart person would not do it. At present, only fighting forward can break through everything. "Light" will surely come soon!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Zhang Zhijiang's Christmas Speech: Mr. Zhang Zhijiang, the Pacification Commissioner of Jiangsu, accompanied by Councilor Weng Guoxun, responded to the invitation of the Sino-Western Pharmacy Broadcasting Station yesterday. Starting at 1:00 p.m., he gave a speech on Christian doctrine titled "The Birth of Jesus" at the radio station. He briefly stated that Christ came into the world to save people, to turn them away from evil and towards good. His great spirit and personality cannot be erased for all ages. Nowadays, human desires are rampant, and greed is insatiable, which has led to the tragedy of internal strife in China and the situation of contention in the international community. How can Christ be resurrected to point out the path for those who are lost? He concluded by saying that the Three Principles of the People are the principles for saving China. If we can proceed step by step, we can make China stronger day by day and eliminate all unnecessary struggles.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Puppet State Deletes and Revises Elementary School Textbooks <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Deleting and Revising Old Textbooks from the Commercial Press and China Bookstore</p>
<p>Cultural Aggression Subtly Shifts Our Ethnicity</p>
<p>A previous Japanese newspaper report from Harbin stated that the puppet "Manchukuo" has methods such as revising elementary school textbooks and adding Japanese language instruction. The purpose is to use cultural aggression to subtly shift our ethnicity and implement the annexation of our Northeast. The sinister intention is evident. To prove this fact, we have obtained a notice from the Education Department of Fengtian Province of the puppet state to the education bureaus of various counties, stipulating the methods for deleting and revising elementary school textbooks, in order to see a glimpse of the puppet state's elementary education and to alert our education community.</p>
<p>▲ Instruction from the Education Department of Fengtian Province of the Puppet State</p>
<p>For issuing orders: Upon investigation, the school opening dates of this province have been submitted for approval and have been notified. Textbooks should be reviewed and ordered in advance to avoid confusion. However, educational undertakings are related to a century-long plan. All items such as reviewing the academic system, textbooks, and examining teaching materials cannot be done by one province alone to set a trend, nor can they be hastily completed in a short time. We should respectfully wait for a unified overall plan and follow the instructions. Now that the school opening is imminent, we have to formulate temporary measures for relief. This department has invited well-known educators in the province, as well as department staff and school principals, to organize a Textbook Preparation Committee. After repeated discussions, it was decided that the compulsory subjects for junior elementary school should be temporarily: Moral Cultivation, National Language, Arithmetic, Handicraft, Drawing, Singing, and Physical Education, ten subjects. The weekly teaching time and curriculum distribution will remain the same for the time being. Regarding textbooks for moral cultivation, it is proposed to temporarily adopt the New School System National Language textbooks previously published by the China Bookstore. For history and geography, it is proposed to temporarily adopt the new textbooks previously published by the Commercial Press. If the content is inconsistent with the times, it should be slightly deleted and corrected, and a temporary deletion and correction table will be formulated for reference. Most schools have existing copies of these textbooks, and bookstores may also have some old books in stock. Even if it is not easy to collect them all at once, each school or education bureau can temporarily print loose-leaf teaching materials. Otherwise, the teacher can write the textbook on the blackboard during daily class or student self-study, and have the students copy it in regular script. This is also acceptable. The words in the elementary school lessons are not numerous and can be written in a short time, which can achieve the effect of previewing and also the effect of practicing calligraphy. It is twice the result with half the effort and is definitely not difficult. In recent years, students' calligraphy has been careless, and it has become a common practice. It can be used to correct this, which is also an important goal. The remaining textbooks will be temporarily allowed to remain as before. The ten-subject curriculum must not contain any anti-foreign materials, and the directors of the education bureaus and school principals must be responsible for handling this matter, strictly supervising and evaluating, and correcting it at any time. On the one hand, this department will send personnel to review it at any time to promote progress. After the textbooks have been decided and printed, this method will be abolished. The above has been submitted to the provincial government for instructions and approval for handling, etc. In addition to distributing it, this original document is urgently copied and ordered to the bureau and schools to comply with it. This order,</p>
<p>▲ Attached Table of Textbook Deletions and Revisions</p>

(3) The Small Citizen Textbook has both colloquial and classical Chinese versions. The principle is to adopt the colloquial version. If there is no colloquial original, the classical version can be adopted.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Junior High School Curriculum Standards (11) <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Fourth, Summary of Implementation Methods</p>
<p>(1) Key Operational Items</p>
<p>Ordinarily, history courses in junior high schools are only taught by instructors. Aside from a few exams, students rarely have other assignments. The following briefly lists the important assignments for this course:</p>
<p>(1) Previewing and Reviewing: For each hour of teaching material, specify the pages of the textbook in the previous hour, instructing students to read in advance so that they have a simple concept before listening to the lecture. After the lecture, instruct students to review at any time and ask questions in the classroom at any time.</p>
<p>(2) Classroom Notes: Supplementary teaching materials beyond the textbook, except for those that are particularly important and should be compiled into handouts or copied for students, others can be taken down as notes in the classroom based on what they learn from the lecture, and then organized outside of class. The teacher should check and revise them at appropriate times.</p>
<p>(3) Practice Outlining: The teacher should use outlines to manage the complex and extensive historical facts and help students understand. On the other hand, they can also assign students to create outlines of the clear and easy-to-understand parts of the textbook (i.e., dividing the original text into several sections, each section further divided into subsections).</p>
<p>The ability to grasp the main points and understand the general idea.</p>
<p>(4) Practice Making Historical Maps and Charts: In addition to using historical maps and charts during lectures, the teacher can also guide students in making such maps and charts. Students can practice making simple maps. Explanations of various charts and diagrams can be assigned as extracurricular work for the entire grade or assigned to a few students to create. Furthermore, historical drawings or imaginative drawings can also be based on selected originals, and those skilled in drawing can copy them. (Detailed and useful maps and charts of this kind can be preserved by the school's history display room for permanent use.) Filling in place names on blank historical maps can also be assigned as a collaborative assignment.</p>
<p>(5) Reading Notes, Reports, and Short Essays: The teacher should guide students to read simple reference books to cultivate their self-study habits. Students should be instructed to take notes on what they have read and report in the classroom in turns. In addition, simple Q&amp;A questions or short essays can be assigned to students based on their level.</p>
<p>(6) Practice Making Current Affairs Reports: Important current events can be reported by the teacher as appropriate, and students can also be occasionally assigned to report on domestic and world affairs in the classroom. After the reports, the teacher should make corrections and explanations.</p>
<p>(7) Other: In addition, field trips to historical sites can be organized, and students can create reports based on what they see and hear. During gatherings held by the school on various national memorial days, students can be asked to give speeches or take lecture notes. For major historical events or the anniversaries of historical figures' births, the teacher can initiate special gatherings as appropriate. When the school holds recreational activities, teaching materials can be used to create and perform historical dramas. Such special assignments can be determined by the teacher based on the time and place.</p>
<p>(2) Key Teaching Points</p>
<p>(1) Managing Teaching Materials: Usually, teachers tend to be detailed at the beginning of the teaching materials and brief at the end, which in history courses results in being detailed about ancient history and brief about modern history, or even abandoning the most important modern history due to insufficient time. To avoid this, the teacher should properly manage the entire teaching material, estimate the time, and make an appropriate distribution of emphasis, and create a "Teaching Material Progress" chart.</p>
<p>(2) Supplementary Teaching Materials: In addition to textbooks, teachers should supplement teaching materials at any time, but copying in the classroom should not take up too much class time.</p>

<p>For special materials, self-compiled supplementary handouts or excerpts from other books should be prepared at any time for application.</p>
<p>(3) Presenting Central Ideas: The teacher should present the central ideas of the history of each period to enlighten students and enable them to achieve the effect of linking teaching materials and seeking systematic concepts.</p>
<p>(4) Making Good Use of Lectures: The history teaching method should be standardized, and in practice, one should adopt a textbook as the standard and lecturing as the center of the teaching method. However, in order to arouse students' interest and attention, lecturing methods should be applied skillfully, such as using storytelling, applying pictures, inserting Q&amp;A, and raising special questions.</p>
<p>(5) Adopting Outlines: Historical facts are complex, and students often struggle to grasp the key points. In order to assist the lecturing method, reveal the system, and enhance students' understanding, the teacher should present the teaching materials in outline form and explain them at any time. It is best to compile and print outlines based on the textbook and necessary supplementary materials to complement the textbook, which can be used as a reference for lectures and as an aid for students' self-study.</p>
<p>(6) Paying Attention to Comparison and Connection: Human evolution is originally continuous, and even historical sites in different places can corroborate each other. Therefore, the teacher should not only pay attention to the comparison and connection between the past and the present, but also seek the comparison and communication between national history and foreign history at any time (comparison, such as the order in which the Chinese and Europeans used the compass; communication, such as the traffic between the Han and Roman empires). Then, although the so-called mixed form is not adopted, the advantages of the mixed teaching method have been adopted.</p>
<p>(7) Guiding the Reading of Reference Books: The teacher must assess the students' level and assign simple reference books for students to read at any time, either for the entire grade to read or for assigned reading in rotation. The teacher must provide full guidance to realize the spirit of "assisted learning."</p>
<p>(8) Paying Attention to the Connection between Current Events and Historical Events: Studying history can reveal the origin of current events, and paying attention to current events can clarify the application of history. Therefore, the teacher should strive to relate to modern society as much as possible within the possible range when discussing historical events. When teaching national history, domestic current events can be reported and explained as appropriate, and when teaching foreign history, international current events can be reported and explained as appropriate. In addition, the teacher should also provide appropriate guidance to students' reading of newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>(9) Referencing the Common Era: The era names of Chinese emperors changed frequently throughout history, and the standard of historical era names has become a major problem. In order to ensure the accuracy of dates and the connection between Chinese and foreign historical sites, using the Western calendar as the common era is a more convenient method.</p>
<p>(10) Applying Maps, Charts, and Pictures: Historical maps are necessary tools for teaching history, because most historical sites cannot be understood without geographical background. This is especially true when lecturing on the boundaries, wars, and transportation of various times. It is necessary to indicate them on special maps or in ordinary maps. In addition, historical charts, pictures, and ancient object models all have the effect of enhancing students' interest and understanding.</p>
<p>(11) Other: In addition, visiting historical sites can arouse students' imagination of predecessors or historical events. Ancient schools can organize field trips to nearby historical sites during the semester. During the trip, the teacher can explain the stories about the historical sites to the students, or instruct the students to take notes on what they hear and refer to. For those with a deeper level, specific problems can be assigned for them to try to write short essays. There are many methods, which must be adapted by the teacher as needed, and pay attention to experimentation.</p>
<p>(12) Equipment Attached to the History Course: The objects studied by history are extremely broad and closely related to life. Therefore, in order to enable students to have a true understanding, there must be considerable equipment. The school authorities must break the concept that history is a type of literature and science, and regard the history subject equipment and the specimens and instruments of physics, chemistry, physiology, and other subjects as equally important. The school should set up a special history exhibition room or classroom, or at least combine a history and geography classroom with the geography subject. The main equipment for the history subject is: 1. Historical maps (wall charts), 2. Historical charts, 3. Portraits of celebrities and historical pictures, 4. Various ancient objects (such as utensils, ancient steles, sculptures, etc.), 5. Models (such as ancient object models, ancient architectural models). This equipment can be purchased, collected, or self-made, and can be stored or displayed indoors. Not only can it be explained later during teaching, but it can also be used as a help for observation at ordinary times. Even if it is limited to funding, it can first be created in a rudimentary way and then gradually expanded.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Labor (Crafts) <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>

<h3 id="e132">Resolution of the Student Unrest at Taiyuan First Normal School <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Students Causing Trouble Expelled and Escorted Back to Their Hometowns</p>
<p>Principal Removed from Office and Personnel Dispatched by the Education Department to Act as Agents</p>
<p>(Taiyuan Correspondence) The once sensational Bingyu student unrest was purely caused by the expulsion of the director of the Provincial First Normal School. The provincial government repeatedly formulated measures and ordered the Education Department to handle it. Only the issue of the principal was not resolved immediately, and internal factions became increasingly intense. Many students from other schools also rose up to support it, which expanded the situation and made it almost unmanageable. The provincial government believed that the actions of all parties exceeded the scope, so it sent personnel to Fenyang to urge Ji Gongquan of the Education Department to return to the province immediately to properly consider measures to rectify the school spirit and uphold discipline. On the 20th, it ordered the Education Department to instruct the school to expel eight students, including Chen Xiyu, Zhang Xingtu, Liu Ying, Yang Yuanrui, Guo Jingyi, Zhang Jinma, Song Xiu, and Li Changgeng. Together with the five students who were expelled for expelling the director, namely Du Lianxiu, Zhang Yaohua, Li Qifeng, Zhang Hanzhang, and Tian Tiande, a total of thirteen students were sent to the Taiyuan Garrison Headquarters by the provincial government order. The students were strictly summoned to the department, and soldiers were dispatched to escort them back to their hometowns and hand them over to the local county government to instruct their parents to take them back on bail and strictly restrain them. Principal Huang Quan was also removed from office for many improper handling issues and replaced by personnel dispatched by the Education Department to strictly reorganize. According to the news, Principal Huang Quan of the First Normal School went to Ping a few days ago. In addition, the inside story of this First Normal School unrest is extremely complicated and has already affected various schools. It is still difficult to predict whether the Bingyuan student unrest can be calmed down from now on. (Evening of December 20)</p>
<h3 id="e133">Jiangsu Education Department Issues a Notice to Elementary Schools in Rural Villages to Allow Agricultural Leave <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Fohai, the head of the Jiangsu Education Department, after personally visiting and inspecting education in Jiangbei this time, felt that the opening and holiday dates of elementary schools in rural villages in various counties were not suitable for the actual rural life situation. For example, students mostly need to help their parents with work during the busy farming season and have no time to study. During the winter and summer vacations, they suffer from sitting idle at home and have no books to read, etc., wasting time and losing learning opportunities, resulting in greatly reduced efficiency. It is now heard that the Education Department, in order to adapt to the actual rural life, has specially formulated a standard for the opening and holiday dates of elementary schools in rural villages in accordance with the academic qualifications issued by the Ministry and has issued a notice to the education bureaus of various counties to allow agricultural leave according to the actual situation in the rural villages and reduce the winter and summer vacations. They will draft measures and submit them for approval and instruction, striving to ensure that the annual study time of students in elementary schools in rural villages can meet the limits set by the Ministry of Education. The order and standards are fully recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department instructed the County Education Bureau: It is found that children in elementary schools in rural villages in various counties mostly need to assist their families in work during the busy farming seasons of silkworm breeding, wheat harvesting, rice transplanting, and rice harvesting and cannot go to school on time. During the stipulated summer and winter vacation periods, the busy farming season has passed, and the children are very idle at home, and they also suffer from the school being on vacation and having no books to read, so that the annual study time at school does not meet the limits set by the Ministry of Education, and the holiday dates often exceed the stipulated restrictions. Such wasted time and abandoned learning reduce efficiency and delay progress, and it is not suitable for the actual rural life, which is very inappropriate. It is found that the academic qualifications issued by this department have the following provisions in the footnotes for elementary schools in rural villages: "The summer vacation dates should be reduced, and silkworm leave, wheat leave, and autumn harvest leave should be granted according to the agricultural situation in each locality." In addition, the county education bureaus should draft change measures and submit them to this department for approval and implementation, which has already been instructed to comply with. Recently, it has been reported that elementary schools in rural villages in various places allow students to be absent from class during the busy farming season, and those who still take summer vacations as scheduled are everywhere. The education bureaus in various places have also witnessed this situation and allowed it to happen without making corrections. They do not implement the provisions of this department to change the holidays, which is a mistake for children and a waste of their studies. This department now aims to focus on children's learning opportunities, improve the efficiency of elementary schools in rural villages, and meet the actual needs of society. It has specially formulated standards for the opening and holiday dates of elementary schools in rural villages in accordance with the academic qualifications issued by the Ministry and will implement them through a notice. All county elementary schools in rural villages that must take busy leave during the busy farming season should first investigate the actual situation in the area by the directors and stipulate the busy leave period according to the standards, and report them to this department for approval and transfer to the schools for compliance before the start of the next semester. If any elementary school principals or teachers disobey orders, take leave on false pretenses, or neglect their duties, they will be severely punished once discovered. It must be known that this is the first point that this department should pay attention to when rectifying elementary schools in rural villages. The directors of the bureaus and the principals and teachers of the affiliated elementary schools should earnestly comply with it and must not neglect it, so as not to incur blame. In addition to separate orders, you must comply with this order.</p>
<p>Standards for the opening and holiday dates of elementary schools in rural villages: (A) Opening dates: (1) First semester: August 1 to January 31 of the following year, 146 days; (2) Second semester: February 1 to July 31, 145 days, 146 days in leap years; (B) Holiday dates: (1) Summer vacation 50 days, July 3 to August 21; (2) New Year's Day 3 days, January 1 to 3; (3) Winter vacation 14 days, January 18 to January 31; (4) Spring break 7 days, April 1 to 7; (5) Memorial holidays: 1. Confucius' birthday memorial day, August 27; 2. National Day memorial day, October 10; 3. Premier's birthday memorial day, November 12; 4. Founding of the Republic of China memorial day, January 1; 5. Premier's death memorial day, March 12; 6. Revolutionary martyrs' memorial day, March 29; 7. Children's Day, April 4; 8. Revolutionary government memorial day, May 5; 9. National Revolutionary Vow Day Memorial Day, July 9; (6) Each school's own school anniversary holiday, no more than two days each year; (7) Various gatherings of each school should be held on Sundays; (8) Each locality may reduce the summer vacation dates or not take the summer vacation according to the agricultural situation, and take silkworm leave, wheat leave, spring plowing, and autumn harvest leave separately, but the total number of holiday dates must not exceed 50 days.</p>

<p>Private Shanghai Middle School on Rue Robert has seen rapid progress in its affairs and a daily increase in students in recent years. The previously rented premises of the former Qunzhi University are no longer sufficient. This summer, there were numerous students who applied to study but were turned away due to reaching the quota. Consequently, last month, the school leased the former site of Great China University at 301 Jiaozhou Road as its campus. The location is ideal, and the buildings are magnificent, capable of accommodating over a thousand students, making it one of the finest properties in Shanghai. It is reported that the school authorities have already prepared expansion plans and increased enrollment. The first enrollment examination for high school and junior high school students of all grades will be held on January 15th next year.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Two Giants of the Western Union Football League, Donghua and Western Police, to Have a Fierce Battle Today <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>At 3:00 PM at the Recreation Ground Football Field</p>
<p>The Outcome Affects the First Division Championship</p>
<p>Donghua and Western Police are the two strongest teams in the Western Union Football League's First Division, each with one loss. Donghua lost to Jinan, while Western Police lost to Lancashire. Today, the two teams will meet for the first time in the First Division, and a fierce competition is expected.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Outcome Affects the Championship <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The outcome of today's match is crucial and will affect the championship. This is Donghua's last match in the first cycle. Currently, Donghua has seven wins and one loss, with fourteen points, while Western Police has six wins and one loss, with twelve points. If Donghua wins, they will have sixteen points in the first cycle, while Western Police can have a maximum of fourteen points. If Western Police wins, they will leap ahead and surpass Donghua, possibly winning the first cycle with sixteen points to Donghua's fourteen. It will be difficult for Donghua to strive for success in the second cycle. It is hoped that Donghua can defeat this strong opponent today. The score comparison is as follows:</p>
<p>Current Score　If Donghua Wins　First Cycle　If Western Police Wins　First Cycle</p>
<p>Donghua　14　16　16　14　14</p>
<p>Western Police　12　12　14　14　16</p>
<p>(Western Police still has one match against Agal in the first cycle, assuming Western Police wins)</p>
<h3 id="e144">Today's Situation for Both Teams <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the season, Donghua and Western Police played each other in the Coupe Reith, with Connaught winning twice against Western Police. Since then, Donghua has had smooth sailing until their defeat by Jinan. Western Police, after the official start of the First Division, lost 2-1 to Lancashire. However, their strength has greatly increased recently, defeating strong opponents in succession with significant victories. Their three midfielders are unmatched in Shanghai. Forward Parker fills the center forward position, Marseille plays left wing, and Jack has also made great progress, so their ferocity is no less than Donghua's. Today's encounter is truly a meeting of equals. The lineups for both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua Team</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Guan Xun'an, Tu Kaiyuan, Feng Yunyou, Wu Youliang, Qian Jingyong, Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Yutian, Cao Qiuting</p>
<p>Western Police Team</p>

<h3 id="e151">The Way Out of the Current Economic Panic: The Relationship Between Recession and a Poor Monetary System <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Gustav Cassel of Sweden, Translated by Xie Juceng</p>
<p>The following article was recently written by the famous Swedish economist Cassel, and it contains keen insights into the main causes of the current global recession and the ways to alleviate it in the future. It will be considered at the upcoming World Economic Conference. It is specially translated and published below.</p>
<p>We live in the richest world that has ever existed, but there are still millions of people on the verge of starvation. At the same time, a portion of the world's population is exposed to terrible poverty, and the situation is getting worse day by day. At least twenty million good workers have no jobs to find, and the number of those who can only find half-day jobs is increasing daily. Many private shops and entire trades are collapsing one after another, and more and more countries are unable to pay their debts.</p>
<p>Since defaulting and the inability to repay debts are so widespread, people have begun to abandon natural facts, and there is no longer any respect for obligations. If things continue like this, it will truly be a great danger to the entire social order, with no end in sight. Why can't humanity make full use of the great resources at its disposal? Why can't we increase production so that prosperity increases year by year, so that everyone can enjoy this prosperity?</p>
<p>One of the most common answers to this question is that progress was too fast in the eight or nine years after 1920, so the result was inevitably a reversal. But do not believe these words.</p>
<p>Many people believe that production rates must be reduced in the future to give consumers time to absorb, so that supply and demand can be balanced. This is completely meaningless. Consumption is determined by production itself. The result of production should never lead to an excessively narrow absorption.</p>
<p>Furthermore, statistics can prove that the development of production between 1922 and 1929 did not increase unusually in general. The economic life at that time only recovered to the rate of progress before the war. There is no reason why such progress should not continue.</p>
<p>Therefore, the assertion that the climax of the speculative craze in 1929 was an important reason for the subsequent economic decline is also generally untenable. Of course, in the United States, the soaring stock prices in the stock exchange were the main reason for the subsequent sharp drop in stock prices. But to say that this kind of regulation of the stock exchange caused a major disruption to the machinery of production and consumption is simply nonsense.</p>
<p>So, why did this healthy development encounter such unfortunate setbacks halfway? There is no other answer than to say that the world's monetary structure collapsed, and there is no need for any other answer. This is simply the result of extremely poor management of the monetary structure. In the early years after 1920, when most countries in the world returned to the gold standard, the author had already said in 1920 that because there was not much gold supply, only the major countries could cooperate on a deliberate gold-saving policy. For the monetary need for gold, there should be a systematic restriction, so that the gold standard would have sufficient stability. This policy naturally included a reasonable distribution of gold between foreign countries. If a few countries want to drag a lot of gold into their own pockets, it should be restrained. If everyone could truly implement this gold-saving policy at a certain time, then the world could enjoy great progress and prosperity.</p>
<p>However, this balance continued to be threatened by a serious situation, which was the payment of reparations and the burden of war debts. These payments clearly exceeded the world's ordinary payment function. If this machine cannot be adjusted, and war debts cannot be made payable, then the last resort is for the debtor countries to be forced to export gold, and for the creditor countries to receive this gold to offset the payments.</p>
<p>Among them, the United States and France were the most prominent. If they lowered their tariff rates, on the one hand, and expressed their best efforts to facilitate the repayment of debts by debtor countries, whether by goods or services, it would be acceptable. In this way, the special difficulty of this payment transfer could be avoided. But the opposite was true. Both countries increased their tariff rates and exhausted every effort to restrict this method of repayment, because they feared that their domestic markets would be subjected to foreign competition.</p>
<p>However, even with this tariff protection policy, the adjustment of the payment balance was temporarily possible, because the receiving countries were willing to extend huge amounts of credit to the world. For example, France mostly accumulated short-term balances overseas, and the United States supplied the world with huge amounts of capital for many years. Therefore, the international payment balance was still maintained very smoothly.</p>
<p>However, this system did not have true stability. As soon as those countries expressed their unwillingness to export capital, the system would collapse immediately. This can be exemplified by France. When France restored the gold standard in the middle of 1928, she began to accumulate large amounts of gold, partly helped by her previously held overseas balances. As a result, capital exports turned into imports. Furthermore, in the United States, domestic demand for capital increased daily, and since the stock market turmoil in 1929, the United States' ability to export capital was naturally greatly affected. At the same time, Germany in Europe had also exhausted her borrowing capacity.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the continued repayment of war debts only resulted in France and the United States accumulating large amounts of gold, and as a result, the gold reserves of other countries in the world were greatly reduced. These reserves usually increased by about 3% each year, but as a result of the above changes, there was a shortage of 2-3% by 1931. As for the reduction of the gold reserve ratio beyond the legal limit, it goes without saying. As a result, the competition of prices in the world market was subjected to a severe pressure, and world prices showed an unprecedented disastrous fall.</p>
<p>It needs to be explained here why the accumulation of large amounts of gold by France and the United States never produced some repayment function to raise the domestic prices of the receiving countries. According to the classical theory of the automatic operation of the gold standard, such price increases are the result of the influx of gold, and once this effect occurs, it can curb the influx of gold, and finally become a reversal of the situation.</p>
<p>However, France and the United States tried to avoid using the new gold they obtained for this purpose. Most of the gold was only stored in the vaults of the central banks, and as a result of the credit restriction policy, not only could these domestic prices not be increased, but they even fell sharply, regardless of the continued influx of gold.</p>
<p>In summary, the repayment of war debts, along with the unwillingness to accept ordinary goods in exchange, caused an unreasonable demand for the world's monetary gold reserves. Moreover, the plaintiffs did not make proper use of the accumulated gold. How could the world prices not plummet?</p>
<p>Many countries that lost gold were forced to abandon the gold standard when they ran out of resources. They felt that domestic prices and wages could not be reduced, especially the burden of their public and private debts. Therefore, they felt that it was impossible to reduce the international price equalization. They had no other way to change except to abandon the gold standard in order to sever the relationship between domestic prices and the price of gold. As a result, the entire gold standard system in the world was completely on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>Under this environment, the first thing to do is obviously to find a way to remove the ultimate results lurking behind these unfortunate developments that we are currently facing. For this reason, there are calls for the cancellation of reparations and war debts. However, we should understand the true meaning of this cancellation movement.</p>
<p>Now, almost twelve years of experience have proven that the payment of war debts and reparations has led the world's monetary mechanism to destruction. The current panic is enough to prove that the world's economic life can no longer tolerate such a situation. Therefore, the world is extremely concerned about the removal of these political payments. This seems like a great sacrifice, but compared with the various disasters caused by the current panic, it is simply a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>The annual war debt payments received by the United States are actually less than 1% of the losses suffered by the American people due to the current recession. Therefore, canceling war debts is a good way to prosper commerce, and the whole world can hope for recovery as a result.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the previous payments of war debts have caused such destruction to the world, so it is not enough to simply cancel war debts in the future. We must also use active measures to restore prosperity. Among them, the most important and urgent need is to raise prices, because those prices have no natural need to fall at all. Only the poor management of the world's monetary system has artificially made the relationship between wholesale prices, retail prices, cost of living, wages, and debt interest rates uneven. To make this imbalance balanced, there is only one way: to raise wholesale prices.</p>
<p>People are confused by past lessons, so when they hear about raising prices, they try their best to oppose it. You should know that under normal circumstances, inflation is indeed not a very good thing. But if we have just come out of a forced contraction, then it is necessary to adopt a considerable method of inflation to cure the diseases caused by contraction.</p>
<p>However, this kind of inflation plan, at the beginning, must be placed under the control of the authorities, and the public must understand an accurate inflation procedure. The purpose should be to raise prices and make them close to the price standard of 1928 as the accurate criterion.</p>
<p>If this plan is recognized as the official policy of the country, it will be easy to achieve results. People can understand that this is not an uncontrolled or unlimited inflation, and they do not need to worry about the future of their currency. On the other hand, they believe that the rise in prices will naturally lead producers to work harder on production. As for what this relies on the authorities, it is only necessary to set a clear goal and adopt a clear policy and strive to achieve it.</p>
<p>Naturally, this plan can increase much credibility if the world's major trading countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, can cooperate hand in hand. If they can reach an understanding on a common policy to raise the prices of their own currencies, they will have the ability to influence the world. Other countries will naturally scramble to join this policy.</p>
<p>This move, of course, does not need to be delayed until after the International Economic Conference is convened. If these two leading countries first start working on the first step of raising prices, it will undoubtedly make the progress of this conference easier.</p>
<p>As for the restoration of the gold standard, that is out of the question. It is too early to try to do this now, and it is also questionable whether the international monetary system can be restored to the gold standard. It is certainly impossible before certain important conditions are fulfilled.</p>
<p>The cancellation of war debts is the first step of these conditions, and the second step is to agree on an organized gold-saving policy, including reducing the customary needs of central banks in various countries for gold reserves. The third condition is to restore considerable freedom of international trade and international capital movement. You can never have any stable international monetary system if it is not based on a connected, reliable, and stable international economic system.</p>
<p>Anyone who pays close attention to these conditions can immediately realize that if the issue of restoring the international gold standard system is raised before the Economic Conference, it will not only be useless, but it will also be unsightly. The only result will be endless discussions that will eventually lead to nothing.</p>
<p>International economic cooperation, such as restoring the freedom and stability of international movement of goods and capital, as it was before the European War, is really indispensable and cannot be delayed. The entire system of restricting foreign exchange transactions and import quantities must first be abolished, followed by lowering tariff rates, and then the international exchange of goods can be expanded as much as possible. This is really a necessary condition for the prosperity of the world.</p>
<p>In our opinion, this restoration work must be carried out in three aspects simultaneously. War debts must be canceled, prices must be raised, and some kind of trade freedom must be restored. It is useless to wait and see each other or implement them one after another. We must do it immediately. We cannot wait any longer, otherwise not only will our economic bankruptcy be imminent, but Western civilization will also end with it. Fortunately, the Lausanne Conference has done a good job in removing the main obstacles that stand in the way of recovery. This is exactly the time to start active work.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Recent Overview of Salt Affairs in Guangdong Province <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The establishment of national salt affairs audit agencies originated from loan contracts. Upon the establishment of the Five-Nation Consortium Loan in the second year of the Republic (1913), our nation's salt administration became subject to foreign supervision. Twenty years have passed since then. The salt base of our country is Nanjing. Former Finance Minister Gu Yingfen once merged the salt affairs audit agencies into the local salt transport commissioner's offices. This was a unification of the audit and administrative departments from a state of separation. However, not long after the proposal was made, Song Ziwen succeeded him and restored the previously merged audit agencies, thus separating them again. Guangdong is one such example. Here is a brief account of the recent situation of salt affairs in Guangdong Province:</p>
<p>Guangdong Province, located in the southern part of the country, has maintained its original state due to special political circumstances. It has not been convenient to make changes. Therefore, although there has been a recent proposal for audit chiefs to concurrently hold administrative positions, as in Liangzhe, Lianghuai, Shandong, and the four areas along the Yangtze River, Guangdong Province still follows the old rules, with administration and auditing remaining independent. The salt affairs administrative agencies in Guangdong Province are the Liangguang Salt Transport Commissioner's Office, along with various deputy transport commissioner's offices and tax and transport bureaus, and salt police teams, all under its jurisdiction. The audit agency is the Guangdong Salt Affairs Audit Sub-office, with audit branch offices in Chaoqiao and Pingnan Gui in Shantou and Beihai, and three tax bureaus in Huizhou, Yangjiang, and Shanwei, namely Dongjiang, Enchun, and Hailufeng. In total, there are about seventy bureaus and checkpoints of various sizes in the entire region, collecting tens of millions in taxes annually.</p>
<p>Guangdong salt is sold in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Guizhou, Jiangxi, and Yunnan provinces. In Guangdong, it is sold in eighty counties, including Nanhai, etc. In Guangxi, it is sold in seventy-five counties, including Huaiji, etc. In Hunan, it is sold in eleven counties, including Bixian, etc. In Jiangxi, it is sold in seventeen counties, including Ganxian, etc. In Fujian, it is sold in eight counties, including Changting, etc. In Guizhou, it is sold in ten counties, including Libo, etc. Only Jinping County in Guizhou Province sells both Huai salt and Guangdong salt. As for the transportation and sales methods, they are contracted by specialized merchants, with a monthly sales quota of a certain amount. For example, in Guangzhou, Hongtai Company contracts to sell 217,000 dan per month. Transport merchants are further divided into upper and lower river merchants. Lower river transport merchants can go to the salt fields to transport salt and return to the province to obtain allocations. Upper river transport merchants are solely responsible for transportation and sales. All contracting merchants who request the release of salt must obtain a tax payment slip from the local audit office, pay the tax at the Central Bank, and after the bank stamps it to prove receipt, bring it back to the audit agency that issued the slip to obtain a salt release permit. Then, they bring the permit to the Transport Commissioner's Office to affix the official seal and obtain a transport license. Only after all procedures are completed is it considered satisfactory. As for the monthly contracted quota, it can be paid in installments, but most have already borrowed several months' quota in advance.</p>
<p>The previous section described that the administrative and auditing parts of the Guangdong salt affairs system are still independent, and their powers are not intermingled. All matters such as issuing transport licenses, managing salt fields, and suppressing smuggling are handled by the Liangguang Salt Transport Commissioner's Office. All matters such as collecting salt taxes, issuing salt release permits, weighing and releasing salt, compiling summary reports of salt taxes, and repaying foreign debts related to salt affairs are the responsibility of the Guangdong Salt Affairs Audit Sub-office.</p>
<p>According to the index of the twentieth year of the Republic (1931), the income from Guangdong salt tax accounts for about one-tenth of the total annual salt tax revenue of the country, amounting to more than ten million national currency. The categories of taxes are also very numerous. Broadly speaking, they are divided into national and provincial taxes. Those belonging to national taxes include three items: regular tax, foreign debt surtax, and miscellaneous taxes. Such as assigned taxes, surcharge on field and road transport tax, fishery salt tax, and private salt supplementary tax, all belong to the regular tax. Water transport fees, allocation fees, salt permit fees for material boats, salt permit fees for fishing boats, salt rations, contracted rations, confiscation of private salt, price of fines, miscellaneous donations, fishing water donations, Min salt transport Shantou transit duty, and Min salt transport Shantou surcharge belong to the miscellaneous taxes. As for the provincial tax, there was previously a 20% Central Paper Currency Surtax, which has now been discontinued. Currently, there is a surcharge for purchasing anti-smuggling ships. In Shantou, there was previously the Chao-Mei River Governance Donation, which has now been changed to the Bandit Suppression Donation. As for annual expenditures, in addition to monthly allocations for administrative, anti-smuggling, and auditing expenses, it is also necessary to remit and repay foreign debt installments. The remaining tax revenue, except for the purchase of ship surcharge under the provincial tax item, is sent to the Liangguang Salt Transport Commissioner's Office for safekeeping, and the Bandit Suppression Donation is handed over to the Eastern District Pacification Commissioner's Office for use. The total is remitted to the Finance Special Commissioner's Office and transferred to the Guangdong Province for all military and political expenses.</p>
<p>The tax rate in Guangdong Province is 2.5 yuan in silver per dan for regular tax, 0.3 yuan in silver for foreign debt surtax, and an additional provincial tax. Salt permit fees for material boats and fishing boats are collected in grades, each with a fixed amount. Other taxes are also the same.</p>
<p>The accounting system of the Guangdong Salt Affairs Audit Department was divided into two major periods from July 1, 1931. In the previous period, the so-called financial accounts were merely the preparation of a report. There was no fixed accounting system or books for reference at any time. At the beginning of the establishment of the audit office, it adopted the old-fashioned accounts used by the customs. On July 1 last year, the audit office promoted the new accounting system of Dr. F. A. Cleveland (currently the director of the audit head office), which brought about a major reform in the accounts. It has been implemented for only one and a half years, and the results are remarkable, which is very commendable. It is necessary to praise the efforts of Dr. Cleveland and the audit chief in their efforts to rectify the situation. The key point of the accounting system lies in the independence of the three parts of the cashiers, accounting and auditing, so that internal checks and balances can be achieved and fraud can be reduced. This is what Dr. Cleveland intended to achieve by promoting the new accounting system. As for the preparation of other accounts, books, and reports, they are all very precise. Accounting comrades who love accounting, why not come and do a detailed study?</p>
<p>The above description of the salt affairs in Guangdong is only a bird's-eye view. It is inevitable that there will be omissions. It is a brief account of what the author can recall. I hope that readers will correct me. (Hongyi)</p>
<h3 id="e153">A Simple Explanation of Modern Currency (3) <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Ke</p>
<p>Chapter 2: The Standard of Currency</p>
<p>From this point of view, under this system, the price of gold and silver has a certain standard. However, this situation can also be expressed in another way, that is, the price of coins is fixed. Each coin can be exchanged for a certain amount of gold or silver. (Note 1)</p>
<p>In this situation, there is a crucial point contained within, and this point is the source of all difficulties. Under the bimetallic standard, the transaction price of gold and silver is stipulated by the government by law. Once this ratio is determined, it is extremely difficult to change it, and it always causes various financial and commercial disorders. The statutory ratio between gold and silver is somewhat arbitrary. Although it can sometimes reflect the comparative value of the two, it can only match for a very short period of time and cannot remain unchanged for a long time. The reason for this is that gold and silver are also commodities, just like rice, wheat, and leather. The value between the two is often fluctuating. Let us assume that on the day the order is issued, the transaction value of gold and silver is under the formula of supply and demand, labor, and transportation costs, and the ratio is one to sixteen. Therefore, the price ratio of gold and silver is set at one to sixteen. But on the second day, a new gold mine is suddenly discovered, and we can obtain a large amount of gold at a lower cost. At the same time, a large silver mine is flooded and cannot be produced. In addition, a new industry is booming and requires a large amount of raw silver. As a result, gold is flooded and silver is scarce. If there is an open market for gold and silver, the price ratio between the two will change immediately. The price of gold will fall and the price of silver will rise. The ratio of the value of the two must not stop at the flat line of sixteen to one.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the production of silver has increased greatly, on the one hand due to the development of new silver mines, and on the other hand due to the advancement of metallurgy, which has enabled a large amount of pure silver to be extracted from other metals. Therefore, the supply of pure silver far exceeds its demand, and its price has also fallen sharply. On the other hand, in terms of gold, experts are always worried about its scarcity and fear that it will be insufficient for use. Although there is no lack of杞人憂天, its price has already risen sharply.</p>
<p>We have said above that if there is an open market for gold and silver, the rise and fall of its price will be the same as the rise and fall of the price of other goods, that is, it is determined by the supply and demand. In countries with a bimetallic standard, there is no such open market for gold and silver. The government always buys or sells gold and silver at a fixed price at any time. However, although an open market for gold and silver cannot be obtained in countries with a bimetallic standard, it can always be obtained internationally. The world has not been united into one, and abides by a common gold and silver price ratio. In each country, the gold and silver price ratio is different. Sometimes, countries with a single standard also buy and sell a metal that is not legal tender as an ordinary commodity at will. As a result, the gold and silver price ratio is disordered, and the drawbacks of the bimetallic standard system are rampant.</p>
<p>After any country adopts the bimetallic standard, after a considerable period of time, one of the currencies of that country will be swept away to foreign countries. This loss can destroy the progress of commerce, reduce the amount of import and export trade, impoverish the public, and create general confusion.</p>
<p>Why will one of the currencies of that country be swept away to foreign countries? A little observation will show that the reason is very simple. According to economic principles, commodities flow to the market with the highest price. Therefore, countries with high gold prices gain gold and lose silver, and countries with high silver prices lose gold and gain silver. The circulation between them cannot be stopped by any law or power. Because people are willing to take risks to seek profit, and there is great profit in the circulation of gold and silver. Therefore, even if there is a legal prohibition, they will still tend to it regardless.</p>
<p>This situation can be illustrated by an example. In 1798, the United States, through the efforts of Alexander Hamilton, adopted the bimetallic standard through Congress, stipulating that one ounce of pure gold could be exchanged for fifteen ounces of pure silver. Later, France set the price ratio of gold and silver at fifteen and a half to one. As a result, American gold flowed to France, and French silver flooded the American market. In 1834, the US government changed the price ratio of gold and silver to sixteen to one. As a result, all the silver in the American market flowed to other countries with higher silver prices and disappeared. The same situation also occurred in England.</p>
<p>What is the lesson of this situation? What is the difference between exchanging gold for silver and exchanging silver for gold? A little deeper investigation will show that there are many difficulties. Now, let us give one example to illustrate the rest. Under this situation, a country cannot regulate the amount of currency circulating in the market. The reason for this is about three points: ㈠ Exchanging gold for silver may be equal in value and quantity, but the gold and silver obtained are the currency or bullion of foreign countries. Therefore, it must be recast before it can circulate in the market. ㈡ The entry and exit of currency are delayed for a long time in transit, so no one can know the exact number of all at one time. ㈢ Sometimes the price of one currency is greater than the price of another currency. All of this makes the supply of currency fluctuate and its quality changes from time to time. As a result, Gresham's Law takes effect, good money flows out and bad money floods in, all prices change accordingly, and the economic stability is destroyed.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is also very inconvenient in fact for a country to adopt one kind of coin as the standard and use other kinds of coins for supply.</p>
<p>There are many such difficulties. Now, I will not describe them one by one. But this does not mean that the theory of the bimetallic standard is a fallacy, nor does it mean that this system cannot run smoothly under the international unified gold and silver price ratio. In fact, the bimetallic standard system has had good results in France, and it has also run smoothly in the later Latin Monetary Union (including France, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, and Greece).</p>
<p>The theory of those who advocate the bimetallic standard system is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>If gold and silver are both coined into legal tender and can be used interchangeably, the market's demand for currency will cause the two to circulate in the market in a considerable ratio of quantity. Although these two are commodities with different industrial or other uses, their influence is not enough to shift the ratio of the quantity of their circulation. (To be continued)</p>

The turnover was about 400 bags. The 20th and 18th grade medium white China Star (華新) goods were tight and not loose, and the asking price was the same as before, with no intention to open if the goal was not achieved. The 80th and 90th grade Dutch red (荷赤) were firm, with little fluctuation. More than 3,000 bags of new Chao green sugar arrived on the Zesheng Wheel the day before yesterday. Because of the strong sales, they were all cleared yesterday. Ordinary goods rose slightly compared to the previous, with high-grade being 9 taels, and then 8 taels and 8 qian to 8 taels and 6 qian. According to the data yesterday, 715 bags were transported to Guisheng Wheel, which was a small number. The sample can be opened today, and the market is expected to be tight.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Coal Market: Both Shanxi and Fushun Coal Prices Rise <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>With the Lunar New Year approaching, wharves and warehouses are required to stop work as usual, and coal is a daily necessity. Therefore, in the last few days of the year, all parties are purchasing and installing coal frequently, especially various stove coals are the most popular. Due to the small amount of inventory of Shanxi coal, and the new goods must be loaded in mid-January of the New Year, most of the selling prices are expected to rise. Yesterday, 350 tons were traded, and the price has risen by more than 1 qian. Fushun lump coal has been selling very well recently, with 400-500 tons traded every day, all purchased by major factories in this port. The selling price has therefore greatly improved. Yesterday, the market price was 12 taels and 5 qian for the first-class block coal, 9 taels and 5 qian for the third ore block, 9 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen for the first-class shoulder coal, and 8 taels for the third ore shoulder.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Miss Swallow (2)</p>
<p>— Ye Feng</p>
<p>She led me to a small room on the third floor of a building facing the street on Old Target Road (老靶子路). She said it was her temporary residence, where she had been living for five days.</p>
<p>"It's where my friend Marie lives. Marie works as a hostess at the Blue Flower Coffee Shop. She's a friend I made in the Philippines. Today she went to the Pik Huang Kek (辟克惶克) in Nanxiang. I only know her in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Looking at the single iron bed, the half-drawn curtain, the small Irish pottery pot, and the open-lidded Coddy flour, I felt that this was like a made-up image of my own bedroom, the homeless home of a wandering soul.</p>
<p>"So, you're living here alone. What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>Having read novels for half my life and wandered for half my life, I'm used to thinking about things that aren't my own.</p>
<p>"Look, this is him. He's the one who asked me to come."</p>
<p>She opened a box in the corner of the room that wasn't locked. Without looking, she skillfully pulled out a photo, came over, and stood next to me.</p>
<p>It was a photo of a middle-aged man with a large face, thick eyebrows, and a wide mouth, but with two sad little eyes.</p>
<p>The lower corner of the photo was scrawled with...</p>
<p>ToMyLitterSwallow</p>
<p>Below that was a signature that was hard to recognize.</p>
<p>"Is this your name?" I asked.</p>
<p>"They always like to call me that."</p>
<p>"What does he do in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>She smiled, as if she was apologizing for her friend's disreputable occupation.</p>
<p>"He used to be an assistant at a sailor's bar in the Philippines. Now he's in Shanghai doing... I don't know what he's doing now."</p>
<p>"Have you known each other for a long time?"</p>
<p>She opened her handbag, took out two long cigarettes, put one in her own mouth, and offered one to me.</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>"Not now."</p>
<p>She threw the cigarette she had offered me on the bed, lit a match, lit the cigarette in her own mouth, took a puff, and blew out a smoke ring.</p>
<p>"You men are always like that. You want something when you need it, and you shake your head when you don't. I've known him for three years, and he's left me six times. He gets cheated by other people and then comes back to me. He forgets about the other people and runs off to them again. I've followed him from the Philippines to Honolulu, from Honolulu to Macau, and from Macau back to the Philippines. This is the second time I've been to Shanghai. Following him, like spring, I'm living the life of a swallow."</p>
<p>She sighed slightly, looked at the sky outside the window, took a puff of her cigarette, and slowly blew out the smoke that she had inhaled, with her head tilted back.</p>
<p>"I'm not like that," I said. "She left with someone else and never came back. I've been waiting for several springs."</p>
<p>"But," she said, as if comforting me and herself, "I believe he will definitely come back. She will definitely come back too. Don't you think so?"</p>
<p>I no longer believed it, but I had to say...</p>
<p>"Yes, I believe she will definitely come back."</p>
<p>For the first time, a smile appeared on her small face.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Outer Strength and Inner Weakness of Men of Letters <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Luyin</p>
<p>Indeed, to bear the signboard of a man of letters on one's shoulders, one must at least be unrestrained beyond the confines of social norms. The most admirable thing is to take money lightly, as if selling one's trousers to visit a prostitute were the epitome of a carefree life. Originally, the Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai was the best example for men of letters—the so-called "Five-flower horse, thousand-gold fur, call the boy to exchange them for fine wine, to dispel with you the sorrow of ten thousand ages!" And also, "A thousand gold spent, will return again!" Such romantic and extravagant behavior is much to be envied, so it's no wonder that contemporary men of letters are always talking about how they don't care about money.</p>
<p>Although men of letters take money very lightly, everyone else—such as the rice store owner and the coal store boss—won't do business without it. This really puts men of letters in a difficult position. In public, men of letters treat money like dirt, but deep down, they deeply understand its power and oppression. Therefore, this discord between their inner and outer selves leads to various contradictory outcomes—</p>
<p>············</p>
<p>One fine afternoon, a group of casually dressed men of letters gathered around a rectangular dining table.</p>
<p>Whiskey, "San Pao Tai" liquor, toast, and beer piled up on the table, and the men of letters, feeling right at home, indulged themselves beyond the bounds of propriety. One bottle, one cup, what a heroic drinking session!</p>
<p>Soon, the sun set, and one of the men of letters, Mr. You, stood up and said, "It's time for us to leave!" The waiter had already prepared the bill and presented it respectfully on a small tray. Mr. You took it and saw that it was thirty dollars and five cents. He generously took a wad of bills from his wallet and quietly counted out thirty-one dollars and two cents. He handed the thirty-one dollars to the waiter, intending to say, "Keep the change," but then he thought of his wife waiting at home to buy candy for the children. So, he quickly swallowed a mouthful of saliva and said, "Bring back the change." The waiter grunted and left, returning with five cents. Mr. You took the two small coins he had left in his pocket and put them on the tray, keeping the five-cent piece in his wallet. The waiter sneered and spat, muttering as they walked out, "What kind of 'Chilao' is pretending to be a big spender?" Mr. You only shrugged his shoulders, acting as if he didn't care.</p>
<p>Mr. You returned home, and his wife rushed out to meet him, saying, "Hey, what are you going to do? The landlord sent someone to urge us to pay the rent again. He said we haven't paid rent for three months, and if we don't come up with something soon, he'll have to ask us to move out."</p>
<p>Mr. You said "Oh" and raised his right hand to scratch his head, calculating in his mind: "When it comes to making money, my skills aren't bad. As long as there's a loophole to exploit, I'll exploit it. This month, I managed to get three hundred dollars, but I haven't been feeling well and need to eat some nourishing tonics. The soft-shelled turtle at Nanxing Residence cost me over a hundred dollars every day. And then there's that pretty girl, Ah Lan, who squeezed me for over a hundred dollars. Alas, I'm really cursed! I could have made a small fortune, but I ran into that enemy of mine, Zhang, who wants to audit the bookstore's accounts. Otherwise, I could have kept at least one-third of the printing money to help with the emergency!"</p>
<p>Seeing him lost in thought and silent, his wife couldn't help but explode, "What exactly are you planning? Are you just going to ignore it?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry, what's the big deal? Can't a famous writer like me support you? You women are always so petty."</p>
<p>"Stop bragging, what do you men of letters have besides your mouths? ... I usually try to reason with you, but you're always saying that men of letters don't care about money, and that you are great. Let's see how great you are now, I really don't understand, how much does greatness sell for a pound? ..." As she spoke, his wife couldn't help but chuckle. Mr. You seized the opportunity to step down, respectfully bowing to his wife and saying, "Okay, Madam!"</p>
<p>"Don't put on that act with me, I see right through you!"</p>
<p>"What do you see through me?"</p>
<p>"I see through you, hmph, a pretentious and useless man of letters with outer strength but inner weakness."</p>
<p>"Well said! Well said!" Mr. You scratched the back of his head, swallowed his saliva, and continued to be tolerant.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Christmas Gifts <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Wang</p>
<p>In a clever, beautiful, floral box, there was a red Santa Claus and three singing birds. Sister Qi braved the winter cold to bring me this gift from afar.</p>
<p>At night, amidst the fatigue of work, surrounded by a group of strangers, after uttering meaningless greetings, my mind clouded, carrying a lonely heart, I quietly walked back from the noisy crowd.</p>
<p>The room was lonely.</p>
<p>I pushed open the glass window, looked up at the sky, and the stars shone with clear brilliance. I took a slight breath and turned around. On the table stood Santa Claus, holding a gauze bag in one hand and a holly branch in the other, with a snow-white beard, smiling at me. It suddenly reminded me that it was the Christmas season! But I smiled sadly.</p>
<p>In dreamlike, hazy memories, I recalled the innocent, joyful childhood and the blurred, lovely image of my mother.</p>
<p>Time flowed like water, and ten years passed quickly.</p>
<p>At that time, like other happy children, I had a kind and gentle mother, and a happy family—</p>
<p>When I was little, the happiest and most welcome time was the New Year, but because my mother was a devout Christian, the impression of Christmas was deeply etched in my mind.</p>
<p>Every Christian family was busy with celebratory ceremonies, and my family was the same. My father would start buying holly trees, shiny silver tinsel, red and white candles, Santa Claus, and many other fun things ten days in advance. My mother was busy knitting woolen outerwear and making flower shoes for me, and teaching me to sing "Silent Night" while playing the piano in the evening.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, the large Christmas tree, which had taken several days to decorate, was placed in the center of the room. The floor was covered with snowflake-like white paper, and large, bright candles were lit on the table, along with many red and white candles on the Christmas tree, creating a humorous and peaceful glow, scattered on the oily green walls. The stove was burning with red flames. I changed into new clothes, wondering what Christmas gifts my father and mother would give me. My mother quietly played the piano, and the song "Silent Night" echoed in the deep night.</p>
<p>Our hearts leaped with joyful extravagance.</p>
<p>When I was just ten years old, my mother abandoned me and left this dark world forever!</p>
<p>Time flowed like water, and ten years passed quickly.</p>
<p>However, sometimes, when these sad memories were evoked, I would feel overwhelmed with distress. I used strong willpower to suppress my tears, and I would run alone to the cemetery, to the side of the railroad tracks, and silently pour out my sorrow in the depths of my soul to the sky, to the withered old trees.</p>
<p>I thought about how my mother had loved me, and how many precious sacrifices she had made to make me a "true person" in this world. I also repeatedly thought of the happy home of my childhood.</p>
<p>Tonight, amidst the fatigue of work, surrounded by a group of strangers, after uttering meaningless greetings, my mind clouded, carrying a lonely heart, I quietly walked back from the noisy crowd.</p>
<p>The room was lonely.</p>
<p>The red Santa Claus was smiling at me, but I burst into tears of sadness!</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>After the meeting, Cao Shiguang and the man surnamed Liao walked up to him with smiling faces to greet him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, your speech was great, top-notch."</p>
<p>"May I ask your name?"</p>
<p>Haiquan asked, his face reddening.</p>
<p>"Liao Haifeng."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he took out a business card from his pocket and handed it to Haiquan.</p>
<p>He was the associate pastor of the association.</p>
<p>Cao Shiguang hurriedly introduced him.</p>
<p>"Let's go to the Old Harry Garden for tea and snacks."</p>
<p>Liao Haifeng stretched out his sleeves, indicating that he would lead them inside.</p>
<p>"Not so fast. Let me introduce him to my wife."</p>
<p>Cao Shiguang said as he walked over to pull a woman over.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, this is one of us, haven't you met her before?"</p>
<p>The woman smiled and bowed to Haiquan.</p>
<p>"I haven't."</p>
<p>She said shyly.</p>
<p>Haiquan looked at her carefully. From a distance, he thought she was a beauty. But up close, the uneven contours of her face were too obvious, a little harsh, and the white powder was also applied too thickly, revealing a commonness.</p>
<p>After a simple tea break, Haiquan looked at his watch and it was almost 6:30. He had not forgotten the time he had agreed upon with Zhuo Shuhua.</p>
<p>"Still an hour and a half to go."</p>
<p>He looked at the situation in the church and knew that Pastor Habar's invitation to dinner was a complete lie by Cao Shiguang.</p>
<p>"Let's go."</p>
<p>"Okay. How about we go somewhere fun?"</p>
<p>Cao Shiguang said happily.</p>
<p>"What fun places are there?"</p>
<p>Liao Haifeng asked Cao Shiguang.</p>
<p>"It would be good to have dinner at that little restaurant."</p>
<p>Cao Shiguang smiled and looked at Haiquan. But Haiquan doubted his ability to host.</p>
<p>"I want to go too."</p>
<p>Mrs. Cao said coquettishly after hearing this.</p>
<p>"Don't be silly! Hurry back and take care of the children!"</p>
<p>"Then you go back too, you're not allowed to enjoy yourself alone!"</p>
<p>She retorted to her husband, also raising her voice.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Great Men and "Death" <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jiabi</p>
<p>Death is the end of life, and the last words spoken from the bottom of their hearts by many great souls as they bid farewell to the world of the living are worth remembering by those of us who are still alive at this moment.</p>
<p>The Greeks viewed death as nothing more than an ordinary event. Life is like a growing tree, and when the fruit is ripe, it must go to another world. Therefore, death is as commonplace as "going to sleep at the end of a happy day." Socrates, on his deathbed, told those who were seeing him off, "My friends, I still owe Asclepius a rooster!" The Greek biographer Diogenes, when a friend asked him, "Who will bury your body?" He said, "Whoever buys my house will have to bury me."</p>
<p>In France, there used to be a saying, "to die without saying a word," but great French figures always had something to say on their deathbeds. Rabelais said, "It is finished, my feet that have walked the long road have brought me here." Ronsard said, "Farewell, my dear friends, I will go ahead and prepare a place." As for the heroes of the French Revolution, there are even more precious last words.</p>
<p>Many words were spoken on the guillotine. Peletier trembled when he saw the guillotine, and the spectators shouted, "Are you afraid to die?" He said, "No, I feel cold!" But when he was refused by the executioner and was not allowed to embrace his friend who was to be executed at the same time, he said bitterly, "Damn you, you can't stop our heads from kissing in the basket!" Because after the execution, the heads were put together in a basket. These heroes' last words can be compared to those of Chinese revolutionary heroes who, at the execution ground, loudly proclaimed, "In twenty years, I will be a good man again!" Both are admirable.</p>
<p>Among many modern literary figures, some last words are also worth noting. The French poet Musset said, "How troublesome a thing death is!" Because he died young, but in his short life he had suffered enough from love and pain. When Renan died, he said, "It is God, the sun is calling me! God has opened the door of my chest." When the German poet Heine was dying, a pastor was praying to God to ask "him" to forgive, Heine said, "Why ask? That is 'his' job!" The French poet Vigny said to God on his deathbed, "The final judgment will come on the day God asks mankind for forgiveness for creating mankind."</p>
<h3 id="e163">The Late Poet Han Shibo <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Mr. Han Shibo was a native of Dantu, Jiangsu. He studied under Zhang Jian of Tongzhou in his youth, but his talent was overflowing and radiant, yet he was incompatible with Mr. Zhang Si. His poems, especially his quatrains, are truly rare since the Tang and Song dynasties. If I say this, some people will say that I am short-sighted and that I am exaggerating, but let's see what his poems are really like.</p>
<p>Lamenting Layman Yang Renshan:</p>
<p>Dressed in grass, sitting on a tiger at the city wall, the wind circles the cattail cushion for ten thousand autumns. To speak of the old Layman Yang Renshan, heaven and earth shook as he entered Nirvana.</p>
<p>Layman Yang Renshan was a great master of Chinese Buddhism. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, the layman happened to be in Nanjing, inviting great Buddhist scholars to entrust them with his robe and bowl, and then he returned to the Dao and passed away. The poem is probably a factual record.</p>
<p>Moonlit Night Climbing Anqing City - A Quatrain:</p>
<p>A pagoda suddenly rides the river, the city's shade is cool, the moon is white and scattered. Ling Lake wants to swallow the dragon's tail, petals of lotus enter the clouds at night!</p>
<p>Let's take the latter poem as an example. The first line breaks through the void and arrives, like Mount Tai flying over, blocking the way, but it is a factual record, not the poet's fantasy, which is its first wonderful aspect. The second line is very difficult to follow. One would think that it must be a majestic and慷慨 sentence, so as not to "place dung on the Buddha's head," but the reply "the city's shade is cool, the moon is white and scattered" is another imaginative idea, taking the entire calm world of a moonlit night into view, which is so beautiful! This is its second wonderful aspect. The third line suddenly makes a bold and fearless imagination, corresponding to the first line, and the fourth line enters a cool world, ethereal and wanting to become an immortal, and the author's great imagination and great personality are transformed into it. This is its third wonderful aspect. However, if you only compare it with the poems of poets such as Su Manshu, then it is simply worlds apart. Shibo's poems are not only majestic in sound and rhyme, but also have the color and light of ascending the Great Buddha Hall. As for his fraternity and active spirit, they are unparalleled in the world. Most of the quatrains since the Tang and Song dynasties have focused their efforts on the latter two lines, but Lao Han's poems are like dragons rising and tigers taking hold from the beginning, and every word falls to the ground with the sound of gold and stone. This is why I cherish and introduce them.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>The author also wants to advise old-style doctors. Even if you are enlightened, you must start anew, and never try to be novel. Now, there are quite a few old-style doctors who say that old-style medicine has already been organized by old-style doctors themselves using scientific methods, and is called modern medicine "scientization." This method of putting on airs is definitely not a success in scholarship, and the concept of "we are old-style doctors, you are new-style doctors" is too deep-rooted. Therefore, I want to advise old-style doctors that if you truly understand science yourself, then you can organize old-style medicine. Then, you will also be a new-style doctor, and we will certainly welcome you very much. If you see the trend of the times and have your son study science, then your son will be a new-style doctor. Then, old-style medicine will naturally be organized using scientific methods, which is the same as the current trend of new-style doctors organizing old-style medicine. If you think there are too many doctors, then in the future, I will only let my little dog study other subjects, and there will be no traditional concept of making a living. It is necessary to use medicine to help the world. I have often compared it to a copper clepsydra and a grandfather clock. They are both things that measure time, and old-style and new-style doctors have the same goal of curing diseases. However, in terms of the times, the copper clepsydra is already too inaccurate. Therefore, we must use clocks and watches. Why only allow the shop of copper clepsydras to put glass frames on the clepsydras and pretend to be clocks and watches, and not allow engineers from clock and watch factories to go to the copper clepsydra shop to take materials to make clocks? It can be seen that it is public to create copper clocks and watches to adapt to the trend, and it is private to only create copper clepsydras in order to maintain the shop. Now, many of the articles written by old-style doctors have already acknowledged that bacteriology, anatomy, and other subjects cannot be erased, and that using X-rays to examine the internal organs has been included in the science of diagnosis. This is the effect of the loud cries of new-style doctors, and it is also admirable that old-style doctors are willing to follow good advice. However, when it comes to later, they often say something about "distinguishing meridians and identifying collaterals," and using "imagination and impression" to diagnose diseases, and gradually enter metaphysics again. This situation is not a characteristic of the old-style medical community, but of our country's education itself, which has not taken natural science seriously. People use cars to travel, but they do not know the simple physics, how can they be blamed.</p>
<h3 id="e165">(II) Explanation of the Map of the Medical Situation in Shanghai <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>(I) This map is a circle, representing medicine in the broad sense. All those who use methods to treat diseases belong to it, regardless of whether there is a theory or not.</p>
<p>(II) The small circle drawn inside the circle represents a kind of combination, and the arrow represents the source and direction.</p>
<p>(III) Wherever dashed lines are drawn in the country, it indicates that the boundary is unclear or not strict, and those covered with dense parallel lines indicate its chaos.</p>
<p>(IV) The country is divided into categories by angle to indicate the size of various medical businesses, and the radius indicates the equipment, economy, and academic progress of its instruments, but these are all estimates and not precise proportions. The various medicines are described as follows.</p>
<p>(A) The new medical community accounts for about one-quarter of the total, but in reality, it is probably less than this number. Although it is divided into various systems, it is only because of the differences in schools, books, and texts. Its theories are all the same, and its talents and subjects are all complete. Therefore, the public mistakenly calls new-style medicine English, American, German, Japanese, and other schools, which new-style medicine cannot recognize. As for the hospital equipment of each department and the scale of the academy, there may be slight differences due to economic relations. However, the drawing in the figure is only for illustration and is not based on accurate calculations. Readers should understand this.</p>
<p>Although the Doctors' Association was established in this new medical community, there are also some people who have not yet joined. Someone jokingly said that the Doctors' Association should not imitate the example of the Lawyers' Association, where those who do not join the association are not allowed to practice medicine. The intention is good, but it is not the time to talk about incomplete medical laws and regulations and the lack of clearance of chaotic medicine. Moreover, lawyers practice law mostly by lawyers appearing in one or two local courts, while doctors practice medicine by a small number of doctors treating millions of patients. One is positive and the other is negative, so it is not easy to ban them. In addition, there are many foreign doctors and many foreign hospitals in Shanghai that have nothing to do with the Doctors' Association. (Therefore, the figure shows a solid line.) They have abundant funds, charge high prices, and have excellent equipment. However, they are only for the exclusive use of a small number of capitalists, nobles, and foreigners, and are far away from ordinary people. Their business has very little to do with the general citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>(B) The old-style medical community can be roughly divided into three categories. One is the truly traditional old-style medicine, such as a certain master teaching a certain disciple. The other is graduates of traditional Chinese medicine schools that have emerged in recent years. The business of these two types of old-style medicine also only accounts for one-quarter of the total medical care, and the number of old-style doctors with great reputations is even smaller. As for the Central National Medical Center, it is a group that is very interested in promoting its already degraded theories. However, metaphysical research is limited to ancient books, and it does not seem easy to progress. It is bound to be mixed with the fur of science, and it becomes the so-called "new and old medical techniques that try to communicate," which is definitely not a truly metaphysical and scientific medical science that is consistent.</p>
<p>(C) The chaotic medical community is the most accessible to the general public. It is estimated to account for about half of the total medical business. On the surface, it seems to be economical and popular, but in fact, it absorbs the money of ordinary people, and its members are also the most complex. Such as hospital servants and nurses in new-style hospitals, and the dregs that cannot be tolerated in formal new-style medicine. A large majority of residents in the city are under the chaotic medicine of the dragon cage. How many millions of people are unable to save their money?</p>
<p>who take the opportunity to speculate and trade for profit. Secondly, there are those in the old-style medical community who claim to be Confucian theory and those who claim to be self-taught without a teacher. Since they have no foothold in the old-style medical community, they flow into this chaotic world to make a living. Thirdly, there are graduates of a small number of Chinese medicine schools who have received a superficial understanding of new theories, know a little about physiology and anatomy, and can recognize a few horizontal characters. They occasionally use Western medicine and give people one or two subcutaneous injections, and then are included in the Western Medical Association to sell their skills that are neither new nor old.</p>
<p>As for the members of the Western Medical Association, we cannot determine whether there is a standard for them to this day. The creation of this association is actually due to the reaction of the law. The initial members of the association were indeed not lacking in nursing students with good skills and many years of practice, or so-called interns from various hospitals, etc. However, the qualifications for joining the association are not based on anything. (The figure is indicated by a dashed line. The author has used its membership list as evidence, and they are all unmarked by origin.) Moreover, it is located in the chaotic medical community. Over time, the content has become even more mixed. (See the Medical Administration section for details.</p>
<p>In addition, lower than that, there are those who push carts and inject people with 914, those who set up stalls to treat teeth, and those who use divine power to prescribe prescriptions, calling themselves San Lao Ye, Chen Tai Ye, Chenzhou Talisman, Zhu You Ke, and so on. There is no need to mention them. Since there is such a chaotic medical community, using the title of medicine as a cover, anyone from the outside world can join to make a living, such as gangsters, witches, clerks in drug stores, Russian vagrants, Indian ophthalmologists, etc. There is no need to mention it. Chinese and Western fake medicines are also rampant. This is truly a magnificent spectacle, and the eyes of the central masters are still in a state of confusion. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Psychology of the Sick <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Chapter 1: General Introduction to Psychology</p>
<p>Section 1: Methods of Research</p>
<p>The condition of an illness varies with age, gender, temperament, and environment, differing in its development, prognosis, and treatment. Similarly, the psychology of a patient varies with age, gender, temperament, and environment in its tendencies. A physician should be skilled in observing and treating them differently. Therefore, one who is adept at analyzing the psychology of a patient is considered a good doctor. For only with a keen mind and dexterous skill can one adapt to changes and handle situations with ease. Insects rely on their antennae to avoid dangers ahead, while humans rely on their keen observation to solve all difficulties. The so-called keenness and dexterity, though received through heredity, can also be acquired through training. One who cannot analyze the psychology of others cannot practice medicine. After opening a practice, they will inevitably suffer spiritual and economic losses. If they have a special interest in medicine, they can only confine themselves to the laboratory and cannot set up a clinic.</p>
<p>To understand the psychology of a patient, it is essential to show empathy and goodwill to the patient, ensuring that the patient can fully express their feelings to the doctor. Only then can the doctor fully understand the patient's psychology. However, the patient's words should not be taken entirely at face value. Attention must also be paid to their actions, the manner of their speech, and the expressions on their face. By cross-referencing and studying these aspects, the analyzed psychology can be grounded in reality.</p>
<p>Students who pay attention to the above-mentioned tasks during their hospital internships will undoubtedly become good doctors in the future. There is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Section 2: ㈠ Sources of Disagreement Between Doctors and Patients and Methods of Resolution</p>
<p>There are roughly four points of contention between doctors and patients:</p>
<p>㈠ Differences in Status: The status of doctors and patients is often divided into aristocratic and common. It is not difficult for a doctor of aristocratic background to treat a common patient in a common manner. However, if a doctor of common background treats an aristocratic patient, they often lose their composure. Therefore, during their school years, they must practice etiquette and speech to avoid vulgarity and cultivate a scholarly demeanor. In short, adapting to the environment is the key to practicing medicine. Only the doctor should defer to the patient, not the other way around.</p>
<p>㈡ Conflicts of Thought: Conflicts sometimes arise between patients and doctors when discussing social issues due to differences in their thinking. The only solution is to avoid discussing issues unrelated to the diagnosis and treatment of the illness altogether. Even if the patient speaks at length, the doctor should only respond with polite agreement and should not engage in debate. After all, a doctor should view the patient as a patient, and there is no need to conflict with their opinions.</p>
<p>㈢ Language Barriers: Different regions have different dialects. Doctors and patients often encounter difficulties due to language barriers. Therefore, a doctor opening a practice in a certain area must first learn the local language. Furthermore, patients have varying levels of education. Doctors must tailor their language, making it either refined or common, according to the patient's level of literacy.</p>
<p>㈣ Differences in Beliefs: Some patients with a superficial understanding of medical principles may presumptuously argue with the doctor's prescriptions and medications. Others, with stubborn minds, may express their admiration for traditional Chinese medicine in front of a modern doctor. These are all instances of differing beliefs. In such cases, the doctor should gently guide them and avoid extreme rejection. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e167">Theory of Treatment (Continued) <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Gong</p>
<p>㈤ Light Therapy: The use of sunlight and ultraviolet light to treat tuberculosis and radium to treat malignant tumors has remarkable results and occupies an important position among various treatment methods. The technique is highly specialized and cannot be fully understood by those with only a superficial understanding.</p>
<p>㈥ Mental Therapy: Some diseases arise from unfavorable environments, leading to depression and melancholy, causing mental decline. Once, a woman who was breastfeeding her child had scarce milk supply. She sought treatment from a doctor. The doctor observed the worry on her face and inquired about her family history. He learned that she was at odds with her mother-in-law, so he advised her to live separately. Soon, her milk supply increased, and the child's weight also increased. This shows that mental comfort is far more effective than medication. In the case of the aforementioned condition, relying on medication would not be effective, it can be stated with certainty.</p>
<p>To ensure the proper application of the above methods, sufficient academic knowledge, skillful techniques, rich experience, and adequate equipment are essential. Therefore, the strength of one doctor is often insufficient, so they consult with other doctors. Or the facilities of the outpatient clinic are inadequate, so the patient is sent to the hospital. If treating a disease is simply a matter of taking medication, then medicine is not so simple. Moreover, the so-called miracle drugs, such as quinine for malaria, Salvarsan for syphilis, and serum for diphtheria, are few in number. Other drugs can only treat the symptoms, not the cause. The relief of symptoms does not mean that the source of the disease is gone. For example, if one suffers from tonsillitis, "acetophenetidin" can be used to relieve the headache, but it cannot be said that "acetophenetidin" is a miracle drug for tonsillitis. Patients with diphtheria often suffer from pain and cannot sleep, so morphine or codeine can be used to calm them, but it cannot be said that morphine or codeine is a miracle drug for diphtheria. Patients with measles use benzoin steam to stop coughing, but it cannot be said that benzoin is a miracle drug for measles. Patients with tuberculosis use atropine to stop night sweats and dilute hydrochloric acid or gentian tincture to stimulate appetite, but it cannot be said that [dilute hydrochloric acid] or [gentian tincture] is a miracle drug for tuberculosis. Patients with nephritis use pilocarpine to induce sweating and magnesium sulfate to induce bowel movements, but it cannot be said that pilocarpine or magnesium sulfate is a miracle drug for nephritis. All of these involve using medication to treat the symptoms. However, the relief of symptoms can also be achieved by "non-pharmacological methods." Therefore, when seeking medical treatment, patients should be cautious not to regard medication as the only weapon against disease.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Common Knowledge Questions About Diseases <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>㈠ Scarlet Fever</p>
<p>Q: What is scarlet fever?</p>
<p>A: Scarlet fever is a highly contagious disease, commonly known as "rotten throat rash."</p>
<p>Q: What is the pathogen of scarlet fever?</p>
<p>A: Recent discoveries indicate that scarlet fever is caused by the transmission of a type of streptococcus, known as hemolytic streptococcus.</p>
<p>Q: How does this pathogen invade the human body?</p>
<p>A: It invades through the mucous membranes of the nasal passages and throat, or through the tonsils and pharyngeal lymph nodes. It can also invade through external wounds on the skin.</p>
<p>Q: At what age is this disease most easily transmitted?</p>
<p>A: It is most common in children between the ages of two and ten. It is less common in infants and adults.</p>
<p>Q: After infection with the scarlet fever bacteria, how long does it take for the disease to develop?</p>
<p>A: The incubation period is three to six days before the disease develops.</p>
<p>Q: What are the initial symptoms of the disease?</p>
<p>A: The initial symptoms include chills and shivering, a rapid rise in body temperature, and sometimes vomiting and convulsions. Soon after, neck problems develop, with difficulty swallowing, and swelling of the tonsils and soft palate.</p>
<p>Q: What happens later?</p>
<p>A: Later, on the second day, red rashes appear on the neck and upper chest, reaching their peak in three or four days and gradually spreading to the torso and limbs. However, rashes on the face are rare, and the area around the lips is completely free of red rashes, so it appears pale.</p>
<p>Q: What is the size and shape of these rashes?</p>
<p>A: Each rash is about the size of a pinhead. Initially, they are pale red spots, and the skin's surface can still be seen. Later, more rashes appear and merge into a single area, turning deep red, hence the name scarlet fever.</p>
<p>Q: On what day does the rash begin to fade?</p>
<p>A: By the tenth day, the temperature may return to normal.</p>
<p>Q: What does the tongue of a scarlet fever patient look like?</p>
<p>A: The mucous membrane of the tongue peels off and is also scarlet red and rough, resembling the texture of a bayberry or a cat's tongue.</p>
<p>Q: Why do most people with scarlet fever also suffer from a rotten throat?</p>
<p>A: Because pharyngitis occurs in conjunction with throat inflammation, leading to erosion.</p>
<p>Q: What other complications can occur during scarlet fever?</p>
<p>A: The most common complication is nephritis. The patient's urine contains protein, the body temperature rises again, the face becomes swollen, the whole body swells, there is ascites, the amount of urine decreases, and it contains blood. Eventually, uremia develops, which is very dangerous.</p>
<p>Q: Are there heart complications?</p>
<p>A: Yes, sometimes there are complications such as endocarditis, myocarditis, and pericarditis, as well as a rapid pulse.</p>
<p>Q: How does the skin return to its original state after the illness?</p>
<p>A: The skin affected by scarlet fever rashes peels off in large pieces.</p>
<p>Q: How should scarlet fever patients be treated?</p>
<p>A: They should rest quietly in bed, and the sickroom should be warm and humid. The diet should consist of liquids. The mouth should be rinsed frequently with hydrogen peroxide. Injections of cardiotonics and the administration of diuretics are also effective. Milk should be given when the patient is thirsty. Injections of scarlet fever serum are also very effective.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Our Country Urgently Needs to Manufacture New Drugs to Meet the Needs of Both Traditional and Modern Medicine <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Guang</p>
<p>Modern medicine has made rapid progress. The depth of its research and the greatness of its inventions are truly advancing at a rapid pace. This is because scientific medicine is based on experimentation and emphasizes accuracy. It does not engage in empty talk or lean towards idealism. It is committed to the truth, even unto death. Therefore, even the slightest evidence or the slightest efficacy of a drug, if it is truly proven, will be recognized and adopted by the whole world. Our country has been impacted by the new trends, and in recent years, it has gradually begun to emphasize scientific medicine. Those who go abroad to study are constantly on the road. Those who return with a wealth of knowledge are too numerous to count. As for public and private medical schools in the country, and medical schools established by foreigners, there are no less than several dozen. Each year, a number of new doctors are inevitably produced. The increasing number of new doctors is inevitable. However, all the medical drugs and equipment used by these new doctors are sourced from foreign countries. Suppose there are fifty thousand new doctors in the country, each spending five hundred yuan per year on new drugs, that would amount to two hundred and fifty million yuan. If there are one hundred thousand new doctors, then it would be fifty million yuan. If we calculate based on hospitals, the expenditure per hospital is ten times greater. The more new doctors there are, the greater the need. With such a huge amount of money flowing abroad, is it not a huge leakage? This is why it is urgent to manufacture new drugs to counteract this. Furthermore, new medicine is scientific medicine, world medicine. Its treatment of diseases is often based on a global perspective and on-site observation. Any scientific doubts or profound mysteries of diseases that need to be elucidated are thoroughly researched. If something is discovered, it is made public and disseminated so that the whole world can benefit from it and alleviate human suffering. There is no room for secrecy. Therefore, prescriptions are only for scientific drugs, only those with true and reliable effects are chosen, only the purest products are accepted, and only those that are absolutely harmless are included. It does not promote heresy or encourage empty words. Its standards are extremely strict. However, today's pharmaceutical factories take advantage of the weaknesses of the people and, while our country's drug laws have not yet been promulgated, often advertise their products without the adoption of doctors. Posters are pasted in the streets, and anyone can buy and take them. Patients, because of the appealing words and the suitability of the condition, are happy to try them, often sacrificing their lives. No wonder the people often criticize the deception of new drugs and ridicule the uselessness of new medicine. I know that if this continues, new drugs will lose their inherent value, and new doctors will indirectly lose their credibility. The future of science is fraught with danger. To correct this, we must establish large-scale chemical pharmaceutical factories, based on pure medical principles, to create completely scientific drugs, to overturn all foreign medicines, and to maintain the reputation of new drugs. This is why the manufacture of new drugs cannot be delayed. With our country's thousands of years of medical history, traditional Chinese medicine has used no less than a thousand kinds of drugs. Among them, there are many effective kinds. If we can select the most effective ones, analyze them chemically, and refine their pure forms, we will surely make a great contribution to the development of new medicine. For example, ephedra and angelica have already been adopted by the world and have become precedents. Those who shoulder this responsibility are only the domestic pharmaceutical factories. The identification is true, and the materials are easy to obtain. This is the third reason why it is urgent to manufacture new drugs. Moreover, our country has a vast territory and abundant resources. What place does not have the raw materials for manufacturing new drugs? Why must we buy them from foreign countries? What worries us is that there is no one to manufacture them and that the procurement is hesitant, so that goods are abandoned on the ground, without knowing how to use them. If there is a need, we have to rely on others. What a shame. At a time when gold is expensive and silver is cheap, foreign medicines, manufactured with extreme precision, are suitable for the use of new medicine, but their value is incredibly high. They can only be used by the wealthy class. As for the common people and small workers, the number of patients is the largest. When they hear about the price of new drugs, they shake their heads and click their tongues. They cannot afford to buy them. Even if they want to seek medical treatment, they dare not. The inability to make new medicine accessible is undeniable. If new drugs are manufactured domestically, wages will be low, costs will be lower, and they will not be affected by the price of gold, nor will they be monopolized by others. The price will naturally be lower. To make them accessible is easy. Therefore, for the convenience of new doctors, for the sake of accessibility, and for the benefit of patients, we must urgently manufacture new drugs and produce them in our own country. Only then can we truly promote the progress of new medicine.</p>
<h3 id="e171">My Philosophy of Life <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Shenchu</p>
<p>Non-Resistance Leads to Extinction</p>
<p>We are surrounded by germs, lurking and waiting for an opportunity to expand their life lines. We have the city walls of skin, the moats of lymph nodes, and the warriors of white blood cells, resisting together to survive. Our lifelines, such as breathing and eating, like the respiratory and digestive systems, must communicate with the outside world to absorb nutrients. Naturally, there are also corresponding devices to prevent stealthy attacks. Therefore, germs that invade through the respiratory system trigger sneezing, coughing, and expectoration to expel them. If they invade through the digestive system, they trigger vomiting and diarrhea to expel them. This is the innate resistance mechanism and the essential element of human survival.</p>
<p>When we fail to take care of ourselves, germs seize the opportunity to enter, occupy key positions, and seize nutrients. This leads to the phenomenon of battle, known as disease, such as fever, which is a symbol of exerting resistance. If the resistance is insufficient, the body weakens day by day, and the germs rage, and the disease intensifies. If the resistance is victorious, the germs die, and the sick body recovers. Therefore, some diseases heal without medicine. In medicine, this is called the natural healing mechanism. The treatment of a good doctor primarily involves providing nutrition and drugs that are equivalent to weapons to the patient to support their resistance. If anything impairs their natural healing mechanism or inhibits their resistance, it is tantamount to helping the germs grow. This is what is meant by a quack doctor killing people.</p>
<p>If the patient does not use their natural healing mechanism, even good medicine is useless. Weapons are supplied to the warriors for continuous use, but they cannot fight on their own. Therefore, some diseases are not cured by any medicine, and good doctors are helpless.</p>

<h3 id="e172">The Boundless Power of Buddhism <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Reading the two special dispatches from Tokyo and Nanjing in this newspaper on the 20th of this month has made me, a religious rebel, deeply feel the boundless power of Buddhism. Now, let's reproduce these two special dispatches as follows:</p>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 19th: The Panchen Lama gave a banquet for reporters at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center at noon on the 19th. In his speech, the Panchen Lama said, "It has been almost ten years since I left Tibet. Fortunately, the conflict between Kham and Tibet has come to an end. I have always adhered to the principle of peace, traveling to Mongolia and the interior, promoting virtue and goodwill, hoping to use religious compassion to supplement what politics cannot achieve. Some say that I will use force to return to Tibet, but in reality, I have no such intention, nor do I have the strength. I sincerely hope that the Tibetan people will pledge allegiance to the central government to alleviate the worries about the west," and so on. Also, Tokyo, Telegraphic News Agency, 19th: The Abbot Otani Kōen of Higashi Honganji Temple, who recently returned to the sect after the bankruptcy problem was resolved, has decided to cross over to Manchuria to promote friendship between Japan and Manchuria through proselytization. He arrived in Beijing a day or two ago and has obtained the understanding of the military and foreign affairs authorities. It is expected to be realized in early January. Regarding this, the authorities of Higashi Honganji Temple told people the other day that it is a very good thing for the former abbot to cross over to Manchuria to reconcile Japan and Manchuria. Our sect is currently working hard to open up Manchuria, so we are very welcome. What a pair of compassionate monks! Although their actions are different, they both want to use religion to supplement what politics cannot achieve, which is no different. However, the "promoting virtue and goodwill" of the oriental monks seems to only be carried out domestically by the national monks, and they are still suspected of using "military force," which is more courageous and diligent. This has a lot to do with the place of origin. Originally, "lazy saints" were mostly produced in the tropics of India, because it is easy to make a living in the tropics. Most people do nothing all day long, so they often entertain themselves with fantasies, chewing on nonsense about thirty-three heavens and eighteen levels of hell, making astronomers and geologists gasp. However, once it crosses national borders, it starts a chemical reaction, merging with Taoism in China and taking on the flavor of "Bushido" in Japan. Although our "National Protection XX Master" - I can't remember the full title - also prayed for peace and the extension of national fortune, it seems that using magic before guns is not as effective as the oriental monks using it after guns. Although Japanese Buddhism was transmitted from China, in this regard, it is "blue surpassing blue." Our "National Master" is a bit ashamed. What I have said above is all nonsense. I only praise "the boundless power of Buddhism, granting all requests," "aggression" and "resistance" are accounted for in one hand, and things are a bit comical. Reading the Shurangama Sutra says, "All sentient beings are like hundreds of mosquitoes gathered in a container, buzzing and making a frenzy." My Buddha is divine, and he must also regret chewing his tongue during his lifetime, and after death - the Buddha said "Nirvana" - he is merely a human puppet. Let me declare that this has nothing to do with me!</p>
<p>Corrigendum: In "A Few Words to Mr. Da Yi" in yesterday's issue of this newspaper, "Why is all literature so good?" It should have been "Why is the new literature so good?" It was discovered that the word "new" was dropped by a worker and was not proofread, resulting in only a question without an answer, almost making it incoherent. We hereby make the correction.</p>

<h3 id="e173">The Terrifying Green Gas <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Leng Mei</p>
<p>At the mention of "green gas," I imagine everyone would exhale and say, "What a fearsome thing!" Indeed, it is a highly toxic gas. Even inhaling a small amount can cause unpleasant sensations, and inhaling too much means signing your name on the ghost registry.</p>
<p>During the World War, poison gas artillery and various poison gas bombs all contained green gas. Countless lives were sacrificed to this inhumane weapon. To this day, the horrifying and tragic images remain deeply imprinted in our minds.</p>
<p>The reason for green gas's extreme toxicity is likely because, upon inhalation, it combines with the water in the lungs to form hydrochloric acid. This hydrochloric acid can corrode the lungs, leading to respiratory arrest and death.</p>
<p>Green gas is a yellowish-green gas with a peculiar and pungent odor that irritates the throat and nose. It is also highly toxic, approximately 2.5 times heavier than air. Under normal temperatures and pressures, one volume of clean water can dissolve 2.5 volumes of green gas, and this solution is called chlorine water.</p>
<p>In nature, there is no free chlorine element because its activity is extremely strong and it easily combines with other elements. Therefore, its compounds are abundant on Earth. Surprisingly, the table salt indispensable in our daily lives is a compound of highly toxic green gas and sodium (chemically known as Sodium Chloride). Jokingly speaking, if you were to give someone those two things separately, they probably couldn't handle it. However, if our dishes are lacking table salt, we are likely to throw a fit!</p>
<p>Green gas is indeed a poisonous substance, but its uses are very broad. It has a powerful bleaching effect. When moist colored cloth encounters this gas, it immediately fades. However, dry colored cloth shows no change. This shows that the bleaching action of green gas is not direct, but rather it first decomposes water to release oxygen. This nascent oxygen has extremely strong activity and oxidizes colored substances, causing them to fade. Green gas also has a significant sterilizing power, so it can be used as a disinfectant. The amount of chlorine used for the above two purposes is extremely large. Because it is inconvenient to transport, it is often manufactured into bleaching powder for industrial use.</p>
<p>Because chlorine gas has a wide range of uses, a large quantity of chlorine is manufactured in industry, usually directly from its compounds. Several methods are described below:</p>
<p>Electrolysis Process</p>
<p>When an electric current is passed through a solution of table salt, potassium chloride, or hydrochloric acid, these compounds decompose, and chlorine gas is released at the anode.</p>
<p>2NaCl＋H2O＝2NaOH＋H2＋Cl2</p>
<p>Deaconsprocess</p>
<p>Heat hydrochloric acid to a high temperature and combine it with oxygen from the air, and a portion of chlorine gas will be released.</p>
<p>4HCl＋O2＝2H2O＋2Cl2</p>
<p>However, this method requires a chloride, such as copper dichloride (CuCl2), as a catalyst to initiate the reaction. If copper dichloride is strongly heated, it will transform into copper dichloride (Cu2Cl2) and release some chlorine. 2CuCl2＝Cu2Cl2＋Cl2</p>
<p>At the same time, when copper dichloride encounters oxygen, it turns into copper dichloride oxide (Cu2OCl2).</p>
<p>2Cu2Cl2＋O2＋2Cu2ocL2</p>
<p>This copper dichloride oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid, turning back into copper dichloride and water. Cu2OCl2＋2HCl＋2CuCl2＋H2O</p>
<p>Thus, a cycle is formed, and a small amount of copper dichloride can be continuously used.</p>
<p>PechineyWeldonprocess</p>
<p>This method is quite valuable in industry.</p>
<p>When a solution of magnesium chloride (MgO) and magnesium chloride (MgCl2) is heated to a high temperature, it transforms into magnesium dichloride oxide (Mg2ICl2). Further heating produces hydrochloric acid and chlorine. The hydrogen in the hydrochloric acid comes from the water,</p>
<p>and the chlorine is displaced from the magnesium chloride by oxygen from the air. This mixture of gases can be passed through water to remove the hydrochloric acid, releasing chlorine. The magnesium oxide is not changed and can continue to be used.</p>
<p>When producing chlorine in the laboratory, the most common method is to heat manganese dioxide and concentrated hydrochloric acid together, which releases chlorine gas.</p>
<p>MnO2＋4HCl＝MnCl2＋H2O＋Cl2</p>
<p>Alternatively, dilute hydrochloric acid can be added to bleaching powder (caocl2) without heating, which also releases chlorine gas.</p>
<p>CaOCl2＋2HCl＝H2O＋CaCl2＋</p>
<p>Cl2</p>
<p>Chlorine gas can directly combine with various metals, such as sodium and antimony. (These metals can burn in chlorine gas and directly combine with it to form chlorides.) 2Na＋Cl2＝　　2NaCl</p>
<p>2Sb＋3Cl2＝2sBCl32Sb＋5Cl2＝2</p>
<p>SbCl5</p>
<p>If a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen gas is exposed to sunlight, a violent explosion will occur, forming oxygen chloride. The same result occurs when a burning candle is inserted into this gas mixture.</p>
<p>Phosgene, used in the Great War, is even more toxic than green gas and is also a chlorine compound. Chemically known as carbonyl chloride (COCL2), it can be produced by mixing chlorine gas and carbon monoxide and exposing it to sunlight. It is a volatile liquid with a boiling point of eighty-two degrees.</p>
<p>The reaction of chlorine with water is very important and is the principle behind the bleaching action of chlorine water. When chlorine gas is bubbled into water, two types of acids are formed: hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid.</p>
<p>Cl2＋H2O＝HCl＋ClO</p>
<p>Hypochlorous acid is extremely unstable and decomposes rapidly in sunlight.</p>
<p>2HClO＝2HCl＋O2</p>
<p>The nascent oxygen produced by this reaction has the function of bleaching. Chlorine can combine with nonmetals. For example, phosphorus can burn in chlorine gas, producing phosphorus trichloride (PCl2) vapor. Sulfur, when heated, can also slowly combine with it, forming sulfur dichloride (S2Cl2), which can be used to make sulfur-containing rubber. Although carbon does not easily combine directly with chlorine, several carbon-chlorine compounds produced indirectly are extremely important and have a wide range of uses, such as dichloromethane CHCl3 (Chloroform) and carbon tetrachloride CCl4.</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>When the pugs were so hot they were sticking their tongues out, I, unable to bear the harassment of the Nanjing bugs (the Japanese bedbugs), moved to this desolate countryside. I live in a newly built house, and of course, there are no Nanjing bugs here. So I couldn't help but put my hand to my forehead and celebrate peace on earth.</p>
<p>This is a new village that hasn't been built for long. After a great fire not long ago, everything here turned to ashes and needed to be rebuilt. There is no running water, no gas, and no electric lights. So we, a poor couple, personally dug a well to replace running water, cut wild</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>grass to replace gas, and burned kerosene to replace electric lights.</p>
<p>We are pitifully weak, and ashamed of our lack of construction ability, but we are also content because we can live peacefully from now on. What more could we ask for?</p>
<p>Late at night, I lean on the table and read. Whenever the kerosene is about to run out and the light becomes dim, I close my eyes and meditate, leaning back in the chair, my hands on my knees, mocking myself for being immersed in the dark, stagnant air.</p>
<p>Last night, two friends happened to come. One was neatly dressed in a Western suit, elegant and refined, and the other wore a long robe and sleeves, with a few oil stains splashed on his chest. But I treated them both with respect, personally taking out Fairy brand cigarettes from the White Dragon cigarette holder and offering them, even bending over to light their matches. Because I was deeply honored to be able to invite friends to visit such a simple residence.</p>
<p>But I worried that my friends would be dissatisfied with my dim kerosene lamp, because it was somewhat incompatible with their tastes. Sure enough, the friend in the Western suit opened his mouth: "Why did you move to a place that doesn't even have electric lights?"</p>
<p>"Uh..." I felt restless.</p>
<p>"This is so stuffy."</p>
<p>"Uh," I could only stammer. What else could I say?</p>
<p>"But it doesn't matter," the other friend opened his mouth, and I knew there was a slight turning point, I was saved.</p>
<p>"What does it matter?" he repeated, "As long as you can see, that's enough. Why do you have to have electric lights?"</p>
<p>"But..." The friend in the Western suit wanted to say more, but because I had drunk too much boiled water that day, I couldn't hold it in and ran to the back of the house to urinate. When I came back, I no longer heard them talking about the kerosene lamp. Really, I was saved.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Please Sit and Other Things <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>...Essays from a Tiny Room...</p>
<p>Please Sit: Generally, those who champion humanitarianism regard sitting in a rickshaw as the most inhumane thing. Indeed, one person pulls another; the one sitting is comfortable, and the one pulling suffers. But I think in today's society, since this system exists, rather than wearing a humanitarian mask and not sitting, which would leave them without a livelihood, it is better to take off the mask, suppress your conscience, and sit within your means, so that they can earn enough for half a liter of rice each day to fill their bellies. It is said that the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway has a fast train that arrives at the North Station every night at eleven o'clock. Around seven or eight o'clock, rickshaws from all over gather near the station. One night, it was already past eleven o'clock, and I was returning from a friend's house, passing through Boundary Road. I saw many rickshaws still parked on both sides of the road, clearly proving that the fast train was delayed. Their yawns, sighs, and groans blended together, and the firefly-like oil lamps seemed to be smiling sadly at their owners, the rickshaw pullers. I was walking shivering when a rickshaw suddenly emerged from the right side of the road. The puller bowed deeply to me and pleaded, "Please sit, give me a few coppers, the train is delayed, and I haven't seen any congee all day!" As he spoke, he actually knelt down with tears in his eyes. At that moment, I was so embarrassed that I couldn't walk or stand. Frantically, I rummaged through my pockets and gave him the only five coppers I had, saying, "I can't help it either, although I seem to be a little better off than you!" As I walked away, it seemed like I could still hear the voice, "Please sit, give me a few coppers..."!</p>
<p>The Words of a Famous Professor: After the September 18th Incident broke out, a famous professor in Shanghai published an article in XX magazine, saying, "The Japanese are really overestimating themselves. You must know that China is so big. Even if we lose the Northeast, we are still a big country and can still become strong." This is indeed a famous saying of the professor. China is indeed not small; it used to have twenty-one provinces, and now it has even more. But I think even if it is big, it is just a combination of a few pieces of land the size of the Northeast. If, as the famous professor said, losing the Northeast still makes us a big country, then losing the Yellow River and Tianjin will still make us a big country, and even if all eighteen provinces of the mainland are lost and all four hundred million compatriots are moved to the Pamirs, we will still not be small. Alas, our famous professor, our famous professor's immortal words!</p>
<p>A Wonderful Couplet: Recently, a wonderful couplet was discovered at the entrance of XX College:</p>
<p>Education, education</p>
<p>Students, students</p>
<p>Yes, we know very well that XX College is worthy of being called a "wild chicken" institution, supported by several frustrated politicians (trustees), with a successful politician as the president, and several fourth- or fifth-rate officials who have reached the end of their road as professors. There is also a group of children of officials who are loaded with money dyed with the blood and sweat of ordinary people to play the role of students, so the college looks like a college. Regarding "love," I heard that there are indeed achievements. Professors advocate from above, and students follow below, so the atmosphere of "love" fills the entire college, which is exactly what the wonderful couplet at the entrance says. I only deeply sigh that if the children they produce are still like the old types, then the bureaucratization of China has the hope of continuing forever. Alas, how brilliant!</p>
<h3 id="e176">A Strange Phenomenon <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Cheng</p>
<p>A Gen had been doing business in Shanghai for several years, and it seemed like he had been skinned alive. His attitude was completely different from before. A half-new serge suit, a pair of shiny leather shoes, a striped cloth shirt, and a red satin tie scared and envied all the mud-legged people in his hometown.</p>
<p>"Shanghai is said to be a fairyland. What is it really like?" When he returned home, neighbors and relatives all gathered around, each with a thirst for knowledge and curiosity, to ask A Gen, who had just returned from the land of immortals.</p>
<p>"..." He described the prosperity of Shanghai in flowery language, exaggerating it many times over, making a group of villagers extremely admire it. In particular, A Gen's father sighed and said, "If I could go to Shanghai once in my life, I could die with my eyes closed! Alas, I'm not blessed!"</p>
<p>"What are you saying, Dad? Why don't you come with me for a few days!" A Gen suddenly had a burst of filial piety and resolutely agreed. So, after a few days, he and his father set off together.</p>
<p>On the way, A Gen's father only imagined the situation in Shanghai, and his cheeks couldn't help but show a smile when he thought of the pleasure. But A Gen was very disappointed, regretting that he had brought his father along, because his father was still wearing a tattered cotton-padded coat, the patches on which were stacked like a pagoda. He was afraid that he would be ridiculed in Shanghai and lose his false display of status... but there was nothing he could do, and he often sighed softly.</p>
<p>When they arrived in Shanghai, they went to roam around everywhere. A Gen's friends saw the country bumpkin who came with him and were twelve parts confused, so they quietly asked him, "Who is that person with you? So poor!"</p>
<p>A Gen was really a little embarrassed. After thinking for a few moments, he was considered clever and alert, so he concealed the truth and replied, "Just because his daughter-in-law and I are on good terms, I brought him along to play."</p>
<p>These words made his friends even more confused, so they teased the country bumpkin behind A Gen's back, "Don't look down on this old bumpkin, there is still a flower in his house!"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? I don't understand!"</p>
<p>"Still pretending! Your daughter-in-law is actually on good terms with Brother A Gen, don't you know that?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you only know one thing, but not the other... You only know that my daughter-in-law and he are on good terms, but you don't know that his mother sleeps with me!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"....................................."</p>
<p>Somehow, A Gen heard these words. He knew that the lie had been exposed, so he had to tell the truth. This kind of strange phenomenon is probably endless in today's deformed society. A wealthy stranger may be recognized as parents, uncles, and elders; otherwise, even if they are one's own parents, they are treated as strangers on the road!</p>
<p>Ah, the strange phenomenon of a deformed society! The evil psychology of base people!</p>
<h3 id="e177">The March of National Crisis <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Mingdao</p>
<p>Eastern Province, Eastern Province, our country's territory, sovereignty belongs to us.</p>
<p>Today, the barbarian horses trample at will... Tombs and graves are not protected, property is not guarded, alone in sorrow, my beloved wife is not mine!</p>
<p>Everywhere, we are called cattle and horses, the sleeping lion should roar!</p>
<p>Holding knives, generous and courageous, spirits high, fresh blood splashes on the ugly invaders!</p>
<p>First song, the singing is strong, let us not forget the national humiliation for a moment!</p>
<p>........................</p>
<p>Countrymen, countrymen, do not hesitate, tigers have entered our homes!</p>
<p>With one heart and one mind, let us drive them out together... Thirsting to drink the enemy's blood, hungry to eat the enemy's flesh, leaping foot Fuso, drunk with wine smashing the Eastern Capital.</p>
<p>Vow to avenge this nine-generation feud, sharpening the Kunwu sword.</p>
<p>Blood like roses, bones like coral, adorning the map of our land!</p>
<p>Second song, the singing is loud, the mountains and rivers are unharmed, the wind is vast!</p>
<p>........................</p>
<p>Sons, sons, be brave and unparalleled, look again at the Wu hook,</p>
<p>With spirit, nothing is difficult... Holding swords to the horizon, reining horses at Helan Mountain, the sad bugle sounds sadly, the iron armor shines cold.</p>
<p>Relying on hot blood to wash away the national shame, leaping forward to be the first.</p>
<p>Heroic ambition reaches the sun, heroic spirit embraces the sky, wrapped in horse hide, we return!</p>
<p>Third song, the sound is intense, the sad rain outside the window stops!</p>
<p>........................</p>
<p>Divine land, Divine land, there are many winds and clouds... the East Sea waves,</p>
<p>The vast Yuyang drums are beating! Hidden steeds neigh in the wind, brave men don their armor. Unrestrained attire, drunk faces in the sand field.</p>
<p>Hang bows on Fuso, destroy the dwarf slaves, return my mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>Whips knock on golden lanterns, people sing paeans of victory, all nations sing of peace.</p>
<p>Fourth song, the energy is like a rainbow, riding the long wind for ten thousand miles, breaking the waves!</p>

<p>On the 18th of this month, I saw Ms. Cheng Qin's "Self-Occupational Introduction" in your esteemed publication. Our school is now planning to hire a Chinese and English typing teacher. I hope you will forward this message to Ms. Qin and ask her to come to our school in person on Sunday (the 25th of this month) at 10:00 AM for an interview.

<p>Therefore, I am often thinking that although I am not a great revolutionary or a national superstar, in the minds of the general intellectual class, there is at least some recognition of me. If I could generously give up everything I have, abandon all the material enjoyment I have before me, and leave alone to join the Volunteer Army in Northeast China, the newspapers would inevitably have several eye-catching reports. (They would not know my true intentions!) Perhaps this could awaken some people, and these awakened people could alert the rest. This would not be in vain for my father who raised me for twenty-five years.</p>
<p>Since the idea of sacrificing myself for the person I love has been decided, I have chosen this method of sacrifice. It is a win-win situation. Although it cannot be said to be "death heavier than Mount Tai," at least it is not as light as Zijin Mountain in Nanjing!</p>
<p>It seems that everything I wanted to say has been said! Some of it is funny and ridiculous, and some of it is passionate and intense. I didn't expect that I, Zhu Jinchi, would have such a great article left behind before I die!</p>
<p>Dear little friend! You may be tired of reading it? But please forgive me. This letter is my last expression to the outside world. After this, if you want to see a word from me or hear a word from me, I am afraid it will not be a fact that can be encountered during the day—perhaps it can still be found in a dream—so I really don't want to end it easily.</p>
<p>Didn't I make a very funny curse just now? I said, "If China does not perish within ten years, I would like to become a tortoise in my next life." This was originally said in jest. Of course, I don't want our Great Republic of China to really perish within ten years, and of course, I don't want to be reincarnated as a little tortoise that will be infamous for ten thousand years—but I can be very frank and sincere in telling you about my direction in the next life. Although the so-called next life is fundamentally a vague and ethereal thing!</p>
<p>I remember the last time I saw you, your belly seemed to be a few points higher than usual. Based on the situation of the previous few days, your and Da Jing's second crystallization is clearly in the process of being manufactured. I further predict that I will leave customs at the end of September and arrive at my destination in mid-October. Based on my physique and combat experience, I will probably have to be listed among the national martyrs before the labor of next year. Then, when the little animal in your belly has grown and is ready to be born, I can catch up in time and drill my soul into his or her body.</p>
<p>If such a thing can really be realized, then my death will be even happier than immortals ascending to heaven after corpse liberation! Beautiful little piglet! I only want to be your son, your daughter, to revolve in your arms all day long, and never let you leave me! I will be more filial than Wang Xiang and Lao Laizi! I don't want a little friend, I don't want a lover, I don't want to marry a wife or marry, I only hope to serve you, this little friend, for life! But please remember—you must never let Da Jing hire a wet nurse for me, otherwise, I would rather starve to death as before!</p>
<p>Haha! I have spoken a long string of nonsense again. At this moment, the car has passed Tangguantun and is about to arrive in Tianjin. When I get to Tianjin, I will hand this letter to the post office. I expect it will be about five days before it reaches you.</p>
<p>The cover of this letter is written very mysteriously. Unless Da Jing has yin and yang in his sleeve, he will never know it. But if you want to let him see it, it doesn't matter. Or it can make him put his mind at ease from now on.</p>
<p>Finished! Everything is finished! Wishing you</p>
<p>Work hard to be your virtuous mother and good wife! Dear little friend, little piglet, little brother! (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e181">A General Outline of the Continental Bank <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The bank was established in Tianjin in the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919). The main organizers were Mr. Tan and Mr. Sun. The bank had a total capital stock of five million yuan and handled all commercial banking business. It also allocated additional capital to engage in savings and trust services. Subsequently, it established a branch in Beiping. In the ninth year of the Republic of China (1920), it established a branch in Shanghai. Branches and offices were then successively established in Hankou, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, and other places. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China (1923), it jointly established the Four Banks Savings Society and the Four Banks Reserve with the Yien Yieh, Kincheng, and China &amp; South Sea Banks, operating together and jointly issuing China &amp; South Sea banknotes. The bank's concurrent operation of savings and trust businesses was originally approved by the Ministry of Finance when it was registered. Two years ago, it established a special department, opened a separate storefront on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, and separated the savings department to operate independently at the same time as the trust department. The Continental Emporium, built by the trust department, has now been fully completed. The savings and trust departments moved into the new location on Double Tenth Day (October 10th) of this year. The Shanghai branch was originally located at the corner of Tianjin Road and Henan Road, renting land to build its own building. Now, due to business development, it has purchased two mu of land on the east side of Jiujiang Road and Sichuan Road to construct a ten-story building, which is expected to be completed around April or May of next year and will then be relocated. In addition, land was purchased between North Suzhou Road and Guangfu Road to build a warehouse specifically for storing mortgaged goods. The warehouse is very large and was completed a year ago. Attached are the architectural drawings and descriptions of the bank's three major buildings in Shanghai, as reference material for those in the country who are concerned about new buildings.</p>
<h3 id="e182">The Continental Building is About to be Completed <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Designed by the Murphy and Dana Architects</p>
<p>Constructed by the Shen Tai Hing Kee Construction Company</p>
<p>The Continental Bank of Shanghai has seen its business flourish for more than ten years since its opening, becoming a leader among Shanghai's banks. The original location at Tianjin Road and Henan Road gradually became insufficient. At the end of the previous year, it purchased a land base at the corner of Jiujiang Road and Sichuan Road to build a building, making every effort to operate. It has been over a year, and it is heard that it will be completed in the coming spring. The building is majestic and magnificent, rarely seen in Shanghai. In addition to being used for business operations, the building has multiple floors upstairs for rent. The entire building is designed and supervised by the Murphy and Dana Architects, assisted by Mr. Luo Bangjie, the bank's architect, who is responsible for handling all matters.</p>
<p>The civil engineering is contracted by the Shen Tai Hing Kee Construction Company. Other projects such as heating, sanitation, electrical wiring, steel windows, and elevators are contracted by well-known manufacturers in Shanghai. Construction officially started in May of last year and is scheduled to be completed in January of the coming year. However, due to the impact of the Shanghai War, it will be completed around May. The total cost is over one million taels.</p>
<p>The overall structure, exterior, and interior are mainly simple and solemn. The layout is modern, and all patterns and clues are implicit and have profound meanings. The architect's original intention was to win with the charm of the layout and the majesty and solemnity of the building.</p>
<p>The building has ten floors. The front is 115 feet high. An additional room is opened on the roof as a bank staff club. The basement floor and the mezzanine floor are for the bank's own use. The vault and machine room occupy most of the basement floor, and the latest type of safe deposit boxes are placed on the mezzanine floor.</p>
<p>All vault doors and safe deposit boxes are specially planned and installed by the American (Mosler) company. Machines are installed that can sound an alarm even if the slightest sound or sound wave occurs in the vault after office hours. The entire building is densely covered with alarm bells for protection, especially for the protection of safe deposit boxes.</p>
<p>There are seven floors available for rent, with a total area of 530,000 square feet. The light in each room is exceptionally sufficient. Each room can be directly accessed from the corridor, but it is also very easy to divide the rooms. Most of the rooms have windows on two sides, allowing for air circulation. Each floor is equipped with water heating and modern sanitary facilities, and each room is also equipped with various electrical and telephone lines for tenants to connect to external lines.</p>
<p>The entire building is equipped with two of the latest Otis elevators, which can rise 500 feet per minute. The upper and lower floors are spacious, so even if there are many tenants going up and down, there will be no crowding.</p>
<p>According to the architect's observation, the upper part of the building can be rented out around mid-February of the coming year. The bank portion will take about three months longer due to the time-consuming marble, bronze, and interior decoration.</p>
<h3 id="e183">The Construction of the Continental Warehouse <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Blueprint by Tonghe Foreign Firm</p>
<p>Constructed by Shen Tai Hing Kee Construction Company</p>
<p>The Continental Bank Warehouse in Shanghai is located on the west side of the New Rubbish Bridge, on the border of the International Settlement, and faces the Suzhou River, making water and land transportation very convenient. The warehouse is a five-story building designed by Tonghe Foreign Firm. It was fully completed in May of last year. The interior is divided into two warehouses. No. 1114 North Suzhou Road is the first warehouse, and No. 1 Guangfu Road is the second warehouse, covering a total area of over two mu and three fen. As for the engineering aspect, in addition to the walls being built with ten-inch bricks, the entire structure is made of reinforced concrete, making it strong and durable. The drilling and driving were undertaken by the West Public School and Gong Kee Construction Company.</p>
<p>American pine wood, 25 feet long and 12 inches square, with a distance of 3 feet 6 inches around each pile, accounts for almost one-third of the total construction cost, so the foundation is very solid. It can be said to be one of the best among ordinary warehouses, so cargo insurance is also calculated at the lowest rate. The height of each floor is 17 and a half feet for the first floor, 12 and a half feet for the second floor, and 12 feet for the third floor and above. Steel windows are used in the front and back to circulate air, adopting the latest European and American styles. It is also heard that the warehouse staff has scientific experience in storing goods. They can distinguish the arrangement of all kinds of goods, their properties, and their relationship to the climate in detail, and can handle them appropriately by classification. Goods stored in the warehouse can be mortgaged to the bank at any time, which is of great benefit to customers. The warehouse was constructed by Shen Tai Hing Kee Construction Company. When the construction of the Science Museum of the National Qingdao University was in progress, photography was undertaken by Shen Tai Hing Kee Construction Company.</p>
<h3 id="e184">One Aspect of Gong Kee Construction Company's Service to the Country During the Shanghai War <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Emporium, constructed by Gong Kee Construction Company, has a total area of over 60,000 square feet and cost over 700,000 yuan. The completion time was only seven and a half months, which is truly remarkable. This is due to the rich engineering experience of the person in charge. When the Japanese invaded Shanghai, the company's project had not yet been completed and handed over. At that time, there was constant gunfire and mourning everywhere. After Mr. Li Denghui and Mr. Zhao Jinqing consulted with the owner, the entire first, second, and third floors of the building were used as a refugee shelter, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth floors were used as a women's wounded soldier hospital. All the walls, doors, windows, floors, paint, etc., were damaged and dirtied. The company voluntarily repaired them completely. All water and electricity were supplied by the company at that time, which was also quite costly. This is sufficient to prove that the company is well-managed and spares no effort to serve the country. The projects undertaken by the company include the six-story building of Renji Hospital on Shandong Road, the church opposite the Municipal Council, and the West Public School. The achievements are outstanding, and all owners and architects who have entrusted the company to undertake projects are satisfied and are often in the industry as well.</p>
<h3 id="e185">A Brief Biography of Architect Zhao Shen <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>

<p>Shanghai has become China's leading modern metropolis. Its trade and industrial and commercial prosperity also rank sixth among the world's major cities. This is something everyone knows. However, if we examine it carefully, although we see that Shanghai's area is so vast, the prosperous center is probably only a few miles in radius. Just imagine that in this area of only a few miles, countless Chinese and foreign, old and new industrial and commercial enterprises are gathered. In fact, it is very crowded and compact, making it extremely difficult. Therefore, they push and squeeze each other, and even occupy and seize each other. Those with stronger financial resources can barely obtain an inch of land, while those with weaker financial resources can only be excluded from the city. Now, how many large factories and large stores cannot develop their businesses, and eventually fail or even lose money because they cannot obtain a central location to display samples or set up business offices. It is truly regrettable to see. Is it because they lack capital, talent, or have poor products?</p>
<p>The success of a prosperous central urban area cannot be achieved overnight, by one person or one force. It has its own situation and history. Since Shanghai's prosperous center is so narrow, to solve this urgent need, we must think of a special method. The Continental Bank Trust Department of Shanghai, with its dedication to serving society and its mission of assisting industry and commerce, has keenly realized this major shortcoming. Especially the pain felt by our country's backward industry and commerce is even more profound, so it must be resolved immediately. Therefore, there was a motion to establish this Continental Emporium. After a long period of research and discussion, it was found that selecting a site was the most difficult. Later, based on the situation of modern business in Shanghai and the trend of future development, a large piece of land was surveyed and determined to be the site for building the emporium, bordering Nanjing Road to the north, Shandong Road to the east, Jiujiang Road to the south, and Youxin Street to the west. As for the superiority of this location, the importance of the situation, and the convenience of transportation, it can indeed be counted as one of the best in the prosperous center of Shanghai. It is very close to the Huangpu River in the east, and it is close to the Huajinli (Shanxi Road) and Rishenglou (Zhejiang Road) areas in the west. It is not far from the French Concession in the south, and it is very convenient to go to the railway station and Hongkou in the north. Therefore, it has become a thoroughfare for the whole city and a trade passage. Moreover, the area capacity is also very large, with more than nine mu of land. It is most suitable to build a great and magnificent emporium in this great location. However, although the landlord is Hartong Foreign Firm, the Continental Trust Department has already had a long-term plan and has signed a long-term lease (32 years).</p>
<p>The Continental Building Under Construction, Designed by Murphy and Dana Architects, Constructed by Shen Tai Hing Kee Construction Company</p>
<p>Designed by Architect Zhuang Jun</p>
<p>Constructed by Gong Kee Construction Company</p>
<p>After determining the site, the Continental Trust Department entrusted Mr. Zhuang Jun, a famous architect in Shanghai, to design the blueprint in the spring of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931). Mr. Zhuang referred to the latest plans from various countries in the world as a standard and supplemented them with modern needs and our country's habits. Mr. Zhuang had very deep experience and quickly completed the plan for this great building. At the same time, Gong Kee Construction Company of this city won the bid to undertake the construction at a cost of more than 700,000 yuan. On March 19th of the same year, the ceremony for the auspicious start of construction was held. Originally, it was expected that the entire building could be handed over in seven and a half months, but unfortunately the Shanghai War broke out, and therefore, it was suspended for several months in the middle. Later, after the agreement was signed and society returned to its original state, Gong Kee Construction Company immediately completed its unfinished construction. By the National Day of this year, this unprecedented grand emporium in Shanghai was finally able to meet us. Looking at the construction of such a large building, the total time required was only a few months. It is truly admirable for the greatness and speed of Gong Kee Construction Company.</p>
<p>The General Aspect of the House and</p>
<p>The Past and Present of Hotel Lanes</p>
<p>According to the building permits issued by the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the construction of the Continental Emporium is the largest. Therefore, the vast area of this emporium and the magnificent construction of the entire building are undoubtedly one of the best in modern Shanghai. Moreover, the four sides of the foundation are all adjacent to major roads. The central part facing Nanjing Road has eight floors, and both sides also have seven floors. A towering tower is built at the corner of Shandong Road, with nine floors, soaring into the clouds, which is also the highest peak of the entire building. The side along Jiujiang Road is four stories high. The entire building was designed by concrete engineer Mr. Miao Kaibo and built into an extremely solid skeleton. Therefore, in addition to being solemn and magnificent, it is very solid. It is specially equipped with all steel windows undertaken by the Shanghai East Asia and Shanghai Er Steel Window Companies. Looking at it, it naturally feels more excellent and beautiful.</p>
