<h3 id="c1">留學制度急應改革 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>暑假已届。國内各大學又將有大批學生「畢業」而出。其中更將有若干人正準備分赴歐美或東洋作進一步之研究。以竟其所學。此似爲吾國數十年來敎育上應有之事。初無可予以疵議或反對。然而就我國目前之敎育而言。吾人則認爲對於此種「盲目」之留學。「浪費」之留學。以及「爲留學而留學」之留學。實有予以考慮改革之必要。</p>
<p>吾人言此。初非反對留學也。爲作精深之研究。爲吸入并考察外國之文化。派人留學。自斷不可少。不過我國之派人留學。從無全盤之計劃。國家之所急需者爲何種人材。留學生之學成歸國者究作何用。實毫未計及。即留學生自身亦毫未計及。派者盲目而派。學者盲目而學。每年分佈各國之留學生。爲數之多。或冠於世界各國。然其生活情形如何不知也。其學業如何。亦不知也。二三年後。留學者即昂然回國。曰我博士也。我碩士學士也。一批博士碩士渡洋而回。又一批候補之博士碩士渡洋而去。循環往復。博士碩士之數日增。而我國敎育之衰落如故。政治之混亂如故。實業之敝凋如故。科學之不發逹文化之不進步亦如故。敎育之成效安在。留學生之貢獻又安在。</p>
<p>吾人初非敢抺煞一切之留學生。謂其對於國家與社會遂毫無貢獻。然而檢閱近二十餘年來之成績。則與其謂留學生之致力於敎育事業或其他實業文化事業爲多。母寗謂其投身於政治舞台。變爲新政客新官僚者爲多。其肯致力敎育事業者則又大多徒知侈談主義。搬演學理。而不求其適合我國之實際情形。行而不通。輒憤憤然歸咎於中國之落後。與外國相差太遠。則灰心喪氣。不可復振。其尤不肖者。則徒知以博士碩士之榮冠炫耀於社會。成爲社會一徒能消費之蠢虫。或則劃分黨派。各立門户。曰我美國派也。我法國派也。或我日本派也。徒知競奪。徒知爲個人之衣食而營逐。此雖非完全爲留學生本身之罪。要亦即所以題示留學制度之在今日亟應改革也。</p>
<p>夫以國内大學甚至中學畢業之學生。旣從未一措意於我國之實際情形。復不曉民間疾苦。一出國門。耳聞目覩。皆表面上物質文明發逹之國家之完美現象。留洋數年。除一身而外。自必全染歐化。學成歸國。其所行與我國之實際情形。鑿枘不入。蓋爲勢所必然。曾有人譏留學生謂。「携一隻狗歷遊世界。」</p>
<p>歸國後其所得者。仍僅爲一隻狗。」雖謔近於虐。然而不先了解本國之情形。不先確定求學之方針。盲目渡洋而去。貿然渡洋而返。學業之無所長進。要亦不能否認其與此喻相差無幾也。</p>
<p>尤其進者。满淸之科舉制度。雖爲愚民政策。不足爲訓。然而以考試拔取優秀之士。究尙能使貧寒子弟有自由競爭之機會。而今日之留學生。則類皆爲富貴之子弟。有錢者雖笨如鹿豕。即自由留學。無錢者雖有可造之資。則惟有望洋興歏。至官費名額。亦大抵爲有欋有勢者捷足先登。貧寒之學生已無力進國内中學大學。於留學則更無由問津。也國内之小學中學日益减少。靑年之失學者日益增多。敎費長年積欠不發。國内敎育幾瀕斷絶。而此特殊階級之留學生。則似獨爲天之驕子。得天獨厚。持故國父老兄弟之血汗。逍遙於國外。事之不平。又孰有逾於此者。</p>
<p>以故吾人認爲今後留學制度。亟待改革。一停止無計劃之派遣。國内大學生畢業後。必在國内服務若干年。先確實了解國内之實情。國家之實際需要。二。確立全盤之計劃。選派農工商敎育政治等各方面服務多年。經騐或學術豐富之士。分往各國學習。以適應國内之需要。必如是。庶幾其能收得留學之實效。庶幾留學不至爲精神與物質之浪費。</p>

<p>鴉片公賣未决舉行</p>
<p>國民黨中央留京辦事處、二十七日晨、舉行紀念週、由汪兆銘報告、兹錄其演詞如下、</p>
<p>「各位同志、今天中央黨部要兄弟報告上一週間的工作、在未報告以前、首先要和各位說明的、紀念週的報告、可分兩種、一種是關於某種問題或某種制度提出作學理上的討論、這種報告、是没有秘密之必要的、可以在報紙上完全披露、使大家來討論批評、一種是關於事實的報告、和前者不同、（中略）淞滬停戰以後、東北形勢、依然嚴重、舉個譬喻、兩個人相打、一個人以一手又住另一個人的喉嚨、同時又以一手搥他的心胸、九一八的事變發生、彷彿我們的喉嚨被人以手叉着、一二八的事變繼續發生、彷彿我們的心胸、又被人搥着了、淞滬停戰以後、對方搥着心胸的一只手、雖已放鬆了、但他可以兩只手叉住我們的喉嚨、同時我們亦可以兩只手來抵抗他、所以日本移淞滬之兵力於東北、是當然的事、我們以全國的力量來集中東北、亦是當然的事、如果不能集中力量、那就是我們自暴自棄、這無異於人家以兩手死力叉住着我們的喉嚨、而我們朿手以待斃了、（中略）在這種嚴重情形之下、我們應該怎麽樣、所謂長期抵抗、决不單靠軍事、一定從種種方面來着手、至少財政與敎育、物質上與精神上、同時要着手、如單以武力作長期抵抗、這就誤解長期抵抗的意義、好似一個人的身體强健了、才可以與人相打、但是使身體强健的條件在那裏呢、至少要做到精神與物質之充實、所以長期抵抗、必先使財政敎育種種方面充實了、才可以作長期抵抗、决不是單靠武力的、這一次與財政外交當局宋羅兩位同志去北平、就是爲此、現在有人責問在抗日的時候、爲什麽還要勦共呢、關於這一點、不能不說明、照道理講、同是中國同胞、在此危急存亡的時候、應一致共赴國難、幾年來、本黨同志四分五裂、彼此相打、固是一個事實、但九一八事情發生、提倡「精誠圑結共赴國難」八個字的口號、則四分五裂彼此相打的事實、立刻打消、使大家專心一致、共赴國難、本黨同志、可以圑結、全國人民、爲甚麽不可以、故在道理上講是對的、但事實還是事實、共產黨不但没有意思和我們共赴國難、並且乘國難的時候、要推翻國民黨、以推翻中華民國、這是一個事實、很明顯地放在我們目前、當一二八情發生、我們因軍事的關係、不能把事實宣佈、現時過境遷、不妨對各位說明、自一二八事情起後、人民紛紛責問政府爲什麽不派援軍、其實當時政府大部分的軍隊、都被共產黨在江西一帶牽制住了、如十八軍陳誠部、在贛州正與共產黨相持、受其種種牽制、不能調離、又如蔣鼎文的第九師調滬、本可於二月二十四日抵滬、至少瀏河可不受日本威脅、但是由江西經福建以入浙江、沿途被共產黨追來襲擊不已、以至遲到三月五號、始能抵滬、這是很明顯的、共產黨不許我們赴援淞滬、不許我們救國、是一個極顯著的事實、所以現在何應欽同志、担任閩贛剿匪總司令、蔣介石同志、担任豫鄂皖剿匪總司令、努力於剿匪工作、期望將五省共匪消滅、方纔可以并力禦侮、至於北方軍事、同時亦正在那裏規劃、（中略）至於財政、宋子文同志辭職、其意義是極嚴重的、現在財政之困難、大家都已明瞭、半年以來、政府並未因軍政費絀而舉行公債、僅就稅收所入、竭蹶維持、以致軍政諸費、祇發五成、臨時經費、全無着落、我們知道節流不能再節的了、而開源如鴉片公賣、雖然有人提及、但是鴉片公賣、雖然法良意美、却是徒法不能以自行的鴉片公賣的精義、在寓禁於徵、未吸者不給牌照、已吸食按照牌照所開數量買吸、而牌照所開數量、是取遞减主義的、至戒絶爲止、所以鴉片公賣、一方政府可以得大批收入、一方可以厲行戒烟、但是如果不得其人、則正可以藉鴉片公賣的名義、大種大賣、勢必至四萬萬人都成了烟鬼、所以鴉片公賣、是不可以隨便舉行的、例如某某省政府、不許人民種鴉片烟、賣鴉片烟、而他一人獨種獨賣、鴉片烟苗、遍於全省、都是他私人所有、及至鴉片太多了、便提煉出來做海洛英、四處出售、這種鴉片公賣、簡直是滅種、不但亡國而已、（中略）兄弟以爲財政當取决於政治、必須政治修明、財政始能充實、所以財政充實、是政治修明之結果、不是政治修明之原因、如有人問兄弟有没有應付財政的辦法、兄弟就問他有没有政治修明的辦法、所以今天我們要下一最大的决心、澈底改革各省政治、而某某省尤其要第一步的改革、這是保存領土最好的方法、也是收復失地最好的方法、促進財政改良敎良的先决問題、請大家一致努力、今天兄弟槪略的報告是如此、」（中央社）</p>

<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>四十一朱先生爲什麽老人不過？這是出我意料之外的一個消息。我起初只道是老</p>
<p>道是老許造謠，决不相信。那裏料得到朱先生竟自認不韓，反而把我弄我弄糊塗了。依我看來，朱先生是决不會背榜的。我想來想去，想不不通，終於老老實實的去請問朱先生。</p>
<p>朱先生說：『我糼時聽見一句俗話，呌做：「老鼠鑽進牛角筒」。你知道牛角這個東西是口兒大大的，越進去越小，一直小到不能再再小才到角尖。牛角，是趨鑽越不能出來，到了最後，只是死路一條條。老鼠鑽進牛角筒便是中國傳統敎育之小影。成千成萬的學生是向向着這牛角筒裏鑽去。學生後面有敎師，敎師後面有督學，督學後面面有局長，廳長部長拿着鞭兒一羣一羣的望牛角筒裏趕。敎官拼命的的趕學生使不得不拼命的鑽。趕得頂起勁的升官。鑽得頂起勁的得一百一百分、領最優等文憑、我只是在角口徘徊不進、雖有人在後面趕也也不情願鑽，鑽不得幾步路，又回過頭來。我不是應當背榜嗎？老許許何曾造謠？我只恨當時旣不願鑽牛角筒、何不痛痛快快的向那海闊闊天空投奔而去。那牛角筒邊有什麽可以眷戀？於今竟因此一念之差差留下這個痕迹，也是我當時没有斬没有斬釘截鐵的决心，纔閙出這這個亂子。』</p>
<p>原來如此，我這悶葫蘆是完全打破了。</p>

<p>— 福記</p>
<p>這六十年來，世界學風的變遷，眞有滄海桑田之槪！　　六十年前，在外國讀書、從小學到中學，都要讀拉丁，希臘等古文字，尤其是在中學，須以拉丁，希臘爲必修科。同樣六十年前，中國正在八股時代，那時讀書人除了文藝以外，没有其他智識。</p>
<p>一八八○年，吾到英國，那時，英國的學風，仍裴歐洲大陸的傳統，英國人也要讀拉了，希臘。其後，美國逐漸注重科學敎育，學生加緊吸收科學智識，對於文藝的研究，也逐漸偏廢，拉丁和希臘等書也就不讀了。直到現在，歐洲大陸的中小學還是敎拉丁，希臘，不過没有像以前那樣注重。重實學而輕文藝，這一個學風的變換，完全受近代科學文明的影響！</p>
<p>在同時代，我們的曾文正公正在大張其桐城派文學的旗幟，倭仁正在大講其「君君，臣臣，父父，子子，：：」的理學。一面提倡策論式的文藝，一面高唱神秘的倫理學。其時，西洋勢力東漸，桐城派和理學那裏抵得住科學文明的狂潮，於是桐城派的文藝和理學派的倫理，遭與希臘拉丁同樣的命運。</p>
<p>西洋的學風已到質勝文野的時代，而中國的學風，文是每况愈下，質更不堪設想了。</p>

<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>本年二月間。十九路軍與第五軍在淞滬一帶努力抵禦日軍時。京滬滬杭兩路附近之軍隊。奉政府命令。相率建築防禦工程。以符長期抵抗之口號。及停戰協定在滬簽字後。此種工程遂半途而廢。徒留陳跡。但一般農民。限於政府命令。不敢擅毁。受累無窮。爰將松禾兩處情形。分誌如次。</p>
<p>松江南門外。於滬戰劇烈時。經軍政部派員勘定爲飛機塲、特圍九圖農田三百餘畝。將河流塡满。阡陌剷除。施工月餘。變成一片平地。　事結束後。農民紛請發還。以備耕種。乃由欵產管理處主任李祖華轉呈軍政部。請迅予發還。以維農民生計。厥後雖奉部復。謂咨江蘇省政府。飭縣查明地畝數目價格。及如何補償損失。詳細核議具報。以憑核辦。飭令靜候云云。奈農民方面。以農時已届。發還尙待核議。阡陌不分。安能下種。故莫不憂形於色。希望勿打官話。從速解决。以維生計。　　嘉興附近鄉鎭。在滬戰時。所駐軍隊。均在田野挖掘戰壕。厥後停戰協定簽字。軍隊逐漸調回原防。浙江省政府恐農民誤以爲此項防禦工程已無需用。或且加以毁滅。故特令飭縣政府轉知人民。如築有防禦工程之處。則農民耕作。務須離去該項工程八尺以外。方可種稻。而在八尺以内者。祇准種植木棉及荳。庶爲兼顧防禦工程及農民生計。縣政府奉令後。當即轉令各區公所。轉知各鄉鎭公所。通告農民切實遵辦。但據老於農事者云。禾地土質。宜稻而不宜棉。荳與稻植時不同。此令表面雖兼顧農民生計。實際則仍受累無窮也。</p>
<h3 id="c154">兆豐公園古鐘之歷史 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 烟雨</p>
<p>靠近兆豐公園的北部，在一座中國式的軒屋面前，有一座碩大的古鐘，穏立在一塊平方的石頭上。大凡遊過兆豐公園的客人，都曾看見過的。</p>
<p>這座碩大的古鐘，並不是放在那裏給遊園的小孩子們爬上去玩耍的；也並不是給遊客們採作攝影資料的。固然，倘若他們喜歡這樣幹的时候，誰也不會前去加以阻止或干涉，而且還是絶對歡迎的。然而，這座古鐘的所以要安置在那裏，唯一的目的，却是因爲它値得保存起來，作爲一種歷史上的紀念物。這是經過了一度激烈辯論以後，才决定這樣安放的。</p>
<p>這座古鐘是在西曆一千八百六十五年，由美國紐約一家鐵廠製造。大約在三十年以前，上海市民决定組織一義勇救火會，而以山東路鐘塔舊址，作爲中央區救火會所，當時這座五千一百五十一磅重量的古鐘，便是懸掛在那裏的。有一位守望者，日常站在鐘塔上，瞭望着四週有無火警。同時，在虹口及新閘方面，也都各有一個分區會所。當時的上海市民，祗消聽鐘聲次數的多少，便可以得知火警發生在那一個區域内。至於本文中所講的，當年懸掛在山東路鐘塔上的這座古鐘，每逢區内發生火警的時候，却是規定鳴鐘六下。</p>
<p>這樣經過了二十年，那座山東路的鐘塔，經不起風摧雨襲，不免現出衰頽的樣子！後來，每逢刮大風的時候，甚至搖搖欲倒了。於是，便决定把這座古鐘，設法卸下，這是一千九百二十一年的事，當時的問題是這樣，一座笨重的大鐘在卸下以後，將怎樣處置它呢！倘若把它投在黃浦江裏，那又未免太可惜了。</p>
<p>當時便有人提議，把這座古鐘，放在靜安寺萬國公墓内。但是一般憑弔者，都起來反對，訴說着鐘聲的可厭。一時社會上議論紛紛、有許多人都主張把這座古鐘，放在不論那一個租界行政機關的門前或是裏面。最後，在一千九百二十二年的十月裏，决定把它保存在兆豐公園内，就是現在放置的地方，一直到今天，以資遊客們摩挲憑弔！</p>
<p>這座古鐘的底周的直徑，是六英尺三英寸，高度四英尺稍强，原價美金一千五百元。</p>

<p>書畫雖小技。然國家之氣運。可以於此覘之。清乾嘉盛時。書法多宗趙董。畫法多宗四王吳惲。承平景象。宛然在目。及同光時。國運稍衰。書家如吳蝯叟翁松禪。畫家如趙撝叔任伯年。皆以風骨魄力相尙。而雍容華貴之意亡矣。降至近日。每下愈况。論書非北魏不尊。論畫非八大石濤不重。支離怪誔。不可究詰。此誠留心世運者所引以爲隠憂焉。昨徇友人之招。驅車寗波路慈安里藝海迴瀾社。參觀扇面展覧會。瞻仰之餘。頓覺令余欣慰不置。蓋藝林風氣。已由衰頽而復於鼎盛。　年闊筆狂塗之習。至此已絶無僅有。不意永嘉之末。復聞正始之音。昔人此言。正堪移贈。未書畫旣與國運有關。當此國步阢隉之際。而書畫界竟能有此佳象。剝極則復。貞下起元。我將於藝海迴瀾社覘之矣。</p>
<p>短訊　程硯秋氏於五月十日遊柏林。國聯考察敎育圑培開爾爲之設宴。介紹柏林各大戲曲音樂院經理。分日參觀。留德學生亦於十六日開開歡迎。遠東協會於二十一日開盛大茶話會。來賓要求程君唱中國戲劇。辭以未帶琴師。僉謂不必伴樂。但求清唱。乃唱荒山淚一段。未唱之前。由林德說明爲非戰和平之劇。大衆拍掌歡迎。要求再唱。於是又唱駡殿數句。合坐稱快。程以酬應稍繁。考察未畢。决留兩月。再往他國云。</p>

<p>在男女之間只隔着一道板壁訟那壁，並不高，一個急於想賞鑑異性的肉體美的人，如果鬰着壁頂顚起脚來看，那是一定可以看個飽的，但是那樣勇敢的人大槪現在是不會有了罷。</p>
<p>這樣的浴室，設備雖然簡單，但是收拾得很清潔。除此之外，也有佈置更完備更精美的浴堂，不過中國人却不許進去。在青島，「不許中國入：：」的事多着呢！日本賣海洛英，開鴉片烟館，私運軍火，不許中國警察去捉，全市不許駐一個中國兵，今年日本神社裏開櫻花時節，不許中國人去看，（大槪是爲了滬戰，聯以洩債罷）：：豈止這區區浴堂而已啊。聽說在生活程度那麽高的東京，浴堂專收費也不過數分呢。</p>
<p>公園的破壞者　　海濱公園落成之初，園裏裝了許多光線充足價錢很貴的電燈炮。但是常給不知什麽人投石子打破了，你裝一次，他打破一次。這個殘暴的破壞者大槪地拿這些公物來當做靶子，衆練他自已的眼光罷。</p>
<p>當局曾爲了此事提出一種賞格，凡捉得這破壞者的賞五十元，但並没有捉到。這殘暴的破壞者爲什麽要破壞這屬於公衆的公物呢！他懷的是什麽種變態心理呢？唉！我從這一點上，看出中國民族性裏具着一種說出來自已覺得可恥的劣性，那就是以殘忍爲樂以破壞自娱的劣性。看見一個人（尤其是女人）在街中央滑跌了一交，兩旁的店夥便打哈哈，甚至於拍掌大笑，從没有一個想走過去扶起他來的人。同樣，當耀武揚威的將軍們將敵方的軍隊打得血流成河而凱捷歸來受着同僚們恭維的時候，他的嘴角也現着基於這種殘忍心理而發出的容。</p>
<p>如果，這一種殘忍心理不從全民族的個個人心中拔去，中國會有一天變成太平的人道的國家麽？我非常他懷疑。</p>

<p>嫁巨商薛炎生　豐衣足食、自訴人迭次夾人向被告接洽履行養老之約、詎被告汩没天良、堅决拒絶、依刑法三百十條之規定、對於無自救力之人、依法令或契約應扶助養育保護而遺棄之或不爲其生存所必要之扶助養育保護者、應搆成刑事罪責、自訴人風燭殘年、貧病交迫、子然一身、别無依靠、其困實有不堪言者、故特依法起訴、請治被告應得之罪、並附帶</p>

<h3 id="c211">自製的小檯燈 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 慶</p>
<p>市上所售的檯燈，大槪都是大的，所費的電力也很不少，我們覺得有些不經濟，現今有個方法，就是自已製造小檯燈，非但用電節省，並且很饒興趣；牠的光亮也很足夠供給案頭上的用處，讀者不妨做一個試騐；方法是這樣的：（原料）方棚（即變壓器Transformer普通　　電鈴上用的，可使普通電壓變成３１２Ｖ·弗脫者爲適用，）一只</p>
<p>小電燈泡（在６Ｖ左右，俗稱汽車燈泡）一只</p>
<p>小燈頭（挿小電燈泡用）一只花線（長短以離接電處之遠近爲定）一條</p>
<p>紗皮包線（二十號左右二呎）一條雪茄烟木箱（長寛高各約五吋左右）一只</p>
<p>小木板（約四吋六七分左右方）一塊陰陽撲落各二只</p>
<p>（以上各物，除木箱及木板外，其餘的在大電料行裏都有賣，有時舊貨攤上也有賣，價格與新的比便宜得多，不過壞的不可用。）</p>
<p>（裝法）將花線一端之兩頭，接在方棚一端之兩頭：紗皮包線二條，各接在方棚另一端之兩頭：然後將方棚釘在板上，放入箱中，把牠釘住，箱邊開一個洞，以備花綫穿出箱外。另一邊再開兩個洞，各裝陰撲落一只，以方棚一端之兩條紗皮包綫的兩頭，接在這兩個陰撲落上：再另拿兩條紗皮包綫，一端接在燈頭上，他一端接在陽撲落上；然後拿燈泡裝上燈頭：這樣裝好了，再把花綫之他一端接在通電流的電綫上（即普通所用的交流電，約２００左右）用時，將陰陽撲落挿在一起，燈就亮了！不過有一點是要注意的，就是方棚裏出來電壓的高低，是否適合電泡所需要電壓的高低，倘使太低，燈就不能亮：太高，就容易把燈絲燒斷，要避免這患處，最好再買一個電阻器rheostar嵌在中間；器之一端接在方棚的一頭，他一端接在一個陰撲落上，用時，只要他電阻器徐徐旋動，燈就慢慢亮了。不過不可太過，看他亮足爲止，不然，就要把燈絲燒斷；倒旋後，就漸漸暗了。旋到底，就熄了。好似煤油燈一般地可以暗、亮、熄自如，而且燈絲也不容易燒斷，較之大檯燈有趣得多哩！</p>
<p>以上是裝接的主要原理，至於外表裝璜，讀者可以自已去想，任意如何裝法？只要依照這原理就行！</p>

<h3 id="c212">老李的日記 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 否今</p>
<p>今天上英文課，上課鐘已敲過了許久，我們的女先生還不見來，同學們都等得有些不耐煩起來了。</p>
<p>「老李」，周同學把手掩着他的口，就近我的耳朶，聲音很小的說：「恐怕黃先生又是月月紅來了，不然怎麽還不來？」</p>
<p>「不一定罷？也許她有别的事情呢」，我笑着這樣說。</p>
<p>眞的，我們的女英文先生實在使同學們太多話了：如果有那一點鐘她因事請假，或者來遲了五六分鐘，頑皮的同學就乘着機會說便宜話，不是說和周同學那樣粗魯的話，就是說她找受人去了。你一句，我一句，說長道短，頂難聽的話也說得出口。這在男同學聽來就破口大笑，女同學聽來就面紅耳赤。可是這些頑皮的同學，見話就說，你實在没有辦法阻止他。</p>
<p>不過，黃先生實在有點便同學多話的地方：雖然三十來歲了，臉兒還是塗得紅紅的：而且，每次來都換一件旗袍。據我的統計，她來敎了四個星期課，每星期三點鐘，足足就換了十二件。好像新娘換嫁裝一樣，眞所謂人老心不老。</p>
<p>然而黃先生的英文敎得很不錯，一字一句，解釋得很清楚，發音也很正確。因爲這個緣故，許多同學都很有心來上她的課，很少有無故缺課的，甚至别班的同學也來揩油旁聽，凑凑熱閙。這一來可就糟了：因爲今年自「一二八」上海的中日戰事發生後，各大學的校舍，大都化成日本帝國主義的砲灰；因之，這個學期，各大學都挾着尾巴跑到租界裏來租洋房子開學。Ｃ校租的洋房子，雖有十多個敎室，可是又狹又小，弄得同學上課下課，都要搶椅子，好像難民搶米一樣，力小的女同學，就被男同學擠進角落裏去，眼巴巴的只是看。因此，每次上英文課，女同學都來得很早；尤其是今天，因爲前點鐘下課時，黃先生曾經告訴我們，說今天這點鐘要問。不單女同學來得很早，就是男同學也來得很早。</p>
<p>同學們還是坐着等，五分鐘，十分鐘，一刻鐘過了，黃先生還是没有來。　　「老李，是不是：我剛剛一句就猜中了。」當同學們一閧而散均走出敎室門口時，周同學拍拍我的肩子，用很滑稽口氣問我。</p>
<p>「不一定罷？也許她有别的事情呢」，我仍然這樣說。</p>

<h3 id="c213">一個婦人 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 問白</p>
<p>社會愈貧困，奸猾欺詐的勾當愈多。這是天經地義萬古不拔的必然的因果。不幸生生今日的中國而爲一個毫無生活保障的平民，就常常會遭逢没工做的危險；一到没工做，便没飯吃，没衣穿，没屋住了。於是，老實一點的便行乞，調皮一點的就爲盗，爲賊了，盗案，我們不是已在每天的日報上看得厭倦了嗎？而那種欺詐的事，大的也見諸於日報，小一點的，祇要你能常常去到十字街頭溜溜，不患不觸目累累。如像賣假約指，假珠寳：：：等等，是大家都早已知道了的，可是那天我所看見的一個婦人，她的騙術却是新鮮的｜｜至少在我是初次發現。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的：那天我同一個朋友去理髮，路過偷鷄僑的時候，忽然有一個穿柳條短衫的婦人來問路：</p>
<p>「先生，對不起！這裏到高昌廟是怎樣去法的？」她說。</p>
<p>「你從這裏趁五路電車到西門；西門再換電車就可直逹高昌廟。」我的朋友告訴她。</p>
<p>「不，我說走去是怎樣走法的？」</p>
<p>「走去？有很多的路呢，你還是趁電車去的好！」朋友看她是一個不甚健康的婦人時，說：</p>
<p>「可是先生，我身邊一個銅子也没有，呌我怎樣趁得成電車呢！你先生能做一點好事，給我兩毛錢嗎？我死也感激你！」她突然現出了一腔憂鬰的情緒，淚像要落下來了。</p>
<p>這樣子，看上去實在呌你不忍，於是我那位慈悲的朋友便很慷慨地給了她兩毛錢。她再三道謝了之後，我們顧自走了。</p>
<p>不多時，我們理髮回來，經過原地方的时候，却見那個穿柳條短衫的婦人仍在偷鷄橋那片敎門館的門口，而且正有一個商人模樣的男子在給她錢。我們看了，情知她是個騙子，立刻想去同她交涉，可是她見了我們，便一溜烟地逃了，你奈何她？</p>

<h3 id="c214">少女和玩具 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>據電通社消息，有下面如此這般的一段記載：</p>
<p>「满洲國之少女使節雷靜淑，楊雲，津田澄子，十泉雪子，金君媛等一行，昨夜八時抵東京，今早赴二重橋向皇城遙拜，次即參拜明治神宮及靖國神社，上午十一時謁田市長，交付满洲國之公文，下午一時出席東京市在日比谷堂之歡迎會，東京市即贈以人像之玩具。」</p>
<p>「女人是玩具？」這樣的說話，是早爲我們大中華民國的太太小姐們所恥認，而向本國的政府取得其男女的平等權了。想不到满洲的這些少女們，居然甘心下氣去向着日本帝國主義者低頭乞憐，向着皇城遙拜，而接受東京市所贈與的玩具，這一幕又滑稽又痛心的傀儡喜劇，是何等的可悲，可恥，可嘆可笑！</p>
<p>本來所謂满洲國的政府？原是日人暴力下傀儡的組織，而這些使節的少女，乃是傀儡下的傀儡！满洲國的所謂執政諸人，原是日人股掌之間的玩具，而這批使節的少女，也不過是玩具者之玩具，由間接的進而爲直接的貢獻禮物。這樣西洋鏡式的老把戲，早爲世界各國所拆穿，我們祇做了可憐的孩子，明知受了那賣藝者的硬逼軟騙，却不敢向他們漢一聲氣。</p>
<p>有人說：這些使節的少女，她們又何嘗甘作玩物？她們也正像山東人變把戲者所雇的孩子一樣，被强暴所壓迫而不得不如此啊！我道：可憐啊！可憐這些少女，不但給日人强姦了她們的身體，並且給日本人强姦了她們那純潔的心窩了！我們除了可憐她們之外，祇好怪我們的家主懦弱，以致把自已的妻女，去供異族的蹂躪！唉！可痛！</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Urgent Need to Reform the Overseas Study System <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Summer vacation has arrived. Universities across the country will soon have a large number of students "graduating." Among them, some will be preparing to go to Europe, America, or Japan for further studies, to complete their education. This seems to have been a normal part of our country's education for decades, with no cause for criticism or opposition. However, considering the current state of education in our country, we believe that there is a need to consider reforming this kind of "blind" overseas study, "wasteful" overseas study, and overseas study that is "for the sake of overseas study."</p>
<p>We say this not to oppose overseas study. Sending people abroad for in-depth research and to absorb and examine foreign cultures is undoubtedly essential. However, our country's overseas study programs have never had a comprehensive plan. What kind of talent does the country urgently need? What will returned students be used for? These questions have never been considered. Even the students themselves have not considered them. The senders blindly send, and the students blindly study. Each year, the number of students distributed across various countries may be the highest in the world, but their living conditions are unknown, and their academic achievements are also unknown. After two or three years, these students return home proudly, declaring themselves doctors, masters, or bachelors. One batch of doctors and masters crosses the ocean to return, and another batch of prospective doctors and masters crosses the ocean to leave. This cycle repeats, and the number of doctors and masters increases daily, but the decline of our country's education remains the same, the chaos of politics remains the same, the decline of industry remains the same, and the lack of scientific development and cultural progress also remain the same. Where is the effectiveness of education? Where is the contribution of the returned students?</p>
<p>We certainly do not dare to deny all returned students, saying that they have made no contribution to the country and society. However, reviewing the achievements of the past twenty years, it seems that more returned students have devoted themselves to the political arena, becoming new politicians and new bureaucrats, than those who have dedicated themselves to education or other industrial or cultural endeavors. Those who are willing to devote themselves to education often only know how to talk about doctrines and act out academic theories, without seeking to adapt them to the actual conditions of our country. When their methods fail, they resentfully blame China's backwardness and the vast difference from foreign countries, becoming discouraged and unable to recover. The most disgraceful among them only know how to flaunt their doctoral and master's degrees in society, becoming parasites who only consume, or they divide into factions, each establishing their own camp, declaring themselves to be of the American faction, the French faction, or the Japanese faction. They only know how to compete and pursue personal gain. Although this is not entirely the fault of the returned students themselves, it does indicate that the overseas study system urgently needs reform today.</p>
<p>Students who graduate from domestic universities, even middle schools, have never paid attention to the actual situation of our country and do not understand the hardships of the people. Once they leave the country, they only hear and see the superficial perfection of materially advanced countries. After studying abroad for several years, they will inevitably become completely Westernized, except for their physical bodies. When they return home, what they practice and the actual conditions of our country are incompatible. This is inevitable. Someone once ridiculed returned students, saying, "They take a dog on a tour around the world. After returning home, all they gain is still just a dog." Although this is a cruel joke, it is undeniable that those who leave without first understanding the situation of their own country and without first determining their study goals, blindly cross the ocean to return, and whose academic progress is insignificant, are not far removed from this analogy.</p>
<p>What is even more advanced is that the imperial examination system of the Qing Dynasty, although a policy of keeping the people ignorant, is not a model to follow, but it still provided poor students with the opportunity to compete freely through examinations. Today's overseas students are mostly children of the wealthy and noble. Those with money, even if they are as dull as deer or pigs, can freely study abroad, while those without money, even if they have potential, can only sigh in despair. Even the government-funded quotas are mostly seized by those with power and influence. Poor students already have no ability to enter domestic middle schools and universities, let alone inquire about studying abroad. Domestic primary and secondary schools are decreasing day by day, and the number of young people dropping out of school is increasing. Education fees are owed for years without being paid. Domestic education is on the verge of collapse, while these overseas students from special classes seem to be the darlings of heaven, enjoying unique advantages, spending the blood and sweat of their fathers, elders, and brothers in their homeland, leisurely abroad. What injustice could be greater than this?</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the overseas study system urgently needs reform in the future. First, stop unplanned sending. After graduating from domestic universities, students must serve in the country for several years to first understand the actual situation of the country and the actual needs of the country. Second, establish a comprehensive plan, selecting and sending experienced or academically accomplished individuals who have served in agriculture, industry, commerce, education, politics, and other fields for many years to study in various countries to meet the needs of the country. Only in this way can we achieve the practical benefits of studying abroad and prevent overseas study from becoming a waste of spirit and resources.</p>

<p>A Certain Important Person Telegraphs Two Chens to Temporarily Ceasefire</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai Scheduled to Go to Guangzhou from Hong Kong This Morning</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Zhangfu only sent planes to bomb the Qiong Xiuying Fort on the 26th, without sending troops across the sea. There was no fighting on the 27th and 28th. A certain important person telegraphed Chen Jitang and Chen Ce, asking them to temporarily cease fire no matter what. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Li Zongren and Chen Jitang Meet and Talk <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Because of Chen Jitang's telegram, Li Zongren requested not to bring troops to Guangdong. On the morning of the 28th, he only led more than ten staff members to the province by Guangsan train. He then went to Chen Jitang to meet with him and talked for two hours. Afterwards, they went to the political meeting together to attend the discussion on the current situation. A decision has been made on the naval issue. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The troops that arrived in Sanshui on the evening of the 26th were actually the Guangdong Training Corps. The Railway Bureau mistakenly thought they were Guangxi troops, causing Guangzhou to be temporarily under martial law. On the morning of the 28th, Li Zongren arrived in the province, and the matter became clear, and martial law was lifted. Li Zongren talked in Wuzhou on the 25th. This trip to Guangdong was entirely for sending troops to suppress bandits in Fujian and Jiangxi. As for which unit to assign and from where to enter Guangdong, it will be decided after meeting with Chen Jitang in Guangdong. The Hainan incident is only a local issue of one group, and there is no need for the four groups to participate. Jiang is now working hard to suppress bandits in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, and is far away from Jiangxi and Fujian. It is unbelievable that he is rumored to be using the name of suppressing bandits to plan for Guangdong. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) On the 28th, Huang Guangrui dismissed Ning Mingjie, the captain of the 3rd Air Force Squadron, Yang Guanyu, the principal of the Aviation School, and Deng Yueming, the captain of the Training Corps.

<p>(Guangzhou) The members of the Southwest Political Council have drafted a telegram to be sent immediately to Nanjing to inquire about the results of the Kuling Conference, and to request that the minutes of the meeting be shown. A month ago, this leader had telegraphed to inquire whether there were any secret annexes to the Shanghai Truce Agreement. This telegram has not yet been answered. At the same time, official newspapers here still publish circular telegrams from various district party headquarters opposing the Shanghai Agreement. (25th Reuters)</p>

<p>Took the Yingrui Warship Westward from Xun</p>
<p>Visited Chibi for an Hour</p>
<p>Strict Security Along the Way in Hankou</p>
<p>Went Straight to the Headquarters After Landing</p>
<p>(Hankou) Chiang Kai-shek took the Yingrui warship west from Xun at 6 p.m. on the 27th, escorted by Yong Sui. Song Meiling, Wang Shihe, and more than 30 guards, and six or seven staff members from the headquarters accompanied him. At 8 a.m. on the 28th, he passed Chibi and landed for an hour's visit, then boarded the ship and continued westward. The Sui Office sent the Qian Si aircraft to Huangzhou at 10:15 a.m. to inspect the Yingrui's itinerary and returned to Hankou to report at 11:15 a.m. The ship had passed Tuanfeng at 11 a.m. Here, preparations were made for Chiang to land at the Sanbei Wharf in the former Russian concession, and troops were sent to guard the area. The police department sent a company of police to guard the Jianggan, and the special service battalion guarded the route to the Yihhe Village headquarters. The Public Security Bureau sent a battalion of security guards to assist in the guard. The river surface was patrolled by the Water Police Bureau and the headquarters guard team. The headquarters also sent a platoon of transport troops to wait at the Sanbei pontoon to prepare for transporting luggage. He Chenjun, Xu Yuanquan, Xia Douyin, Wei Lihuang, Cao Haosen, and others were all waiting at Jianggan to welcome him. At 3:35 p.m., the Yingrui arrived, followed by the Yong Sui. Because Chiang's flagship did not raise its flag, no Chinese or foreign ships fired salutes. The Yingrui was docked at the Jianghan Pass. He Chenjun and others boarded the ship on a special wheel to pay their respects. Chiang shook hands with them one by one. Chiang was dressed in a gray Zhongshan suit, wearing glasses and a top hat. He then led Song Meiling and a child to board a special wheel with He Chenjun and others to land. The Yingrui fired an 18-gun salute and played music. Chiang landed at 4 p.m. and immediately took a car to the headquarters to rest. He Chenjun and others all went to listen to his instructions. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Chiang Kai-shek left Lushan at 3 p.m. on the 27th and took a ship west in the evening. Wang Shihe, Liu Zhenhua, He Zhonghan, and Zhang Zhenhan all accompanied him. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Meeting with He Chenjun at Yihhe Village <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) At 4:30 p.m., Chiang Kai-shek met with He Chenjun at the Yihhe Village mansion and inquired about the situation in all directions. He did not talk much. According to what He Chenjun told others, Chiang is very clear about the bandit situation in the three provinces, and the arrangements are in place. A large-scale campaign will be launched to eliminate them in a short period of time. Chiang decided to advance bandit suppression and post-disaster reconstruction at the same time, in order to restore local vitality and eradicate the bandit scourge forever. The bandits are currently being suppressed by Ma Hongda's troops, and Xinyang is safe. It is also heard that Chiang plans to visit Luojia Mountain in the next few days and will temporarily sit in Hankou. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e46">Comparison of Water Levels on the Yangtze River at Hankou Over the Years <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) The river water here has risen again, and local residents are terrified, thinking that the flood of last year will reappear. Because the pain they suffered was deep, they are alarmed by even a slight rise in water. It is not surprising. If we compare the current water level with the higher water levels in the past that did not cause disasters, we will know that the current water level is not high and is not as serious as reported in various newspapers. The water level in Hankou on June 25 this year was 36 feet 9 inches. If you refer to the table below, you will know that there is no basis for suspicion and fear.</p>
<p>Year Date Highest Water Level 1901 June 2 37 feet 15th day</p>
<p>1906 Same as above 40 feet</p>
<p>1909 Same as above 39 feet 2 inches</p>
<p>1911 Same as above 43 feet</p>
<p>1913 Same as above 39 feet 5 inches</p>
<p>1914 Same as above 39 feet 7 inches</p>
<p>1917 Same as above 37 feet 2 inches</p>
<p>1918 Same as above 39 feet</p>
<p>1920 Same as above 38 feet</p>
<p>1921 Same as above 40 feet 5 inches</p>
<p>1931 Same as above 39 feet</p>
<p>The water level there on June 25 last year was 39 feet. Floods are caused by rising river water and sudden heavy rain. It is difficult to predict whether there will be floods in August this year because no one can predict the rainfall at that time. However, judging from the current water level, it is still relatively low, so there is no need to be overly alarmed. The rise and fall of the river water this year is more normal compared to previous years. Because from June 1 to the most recent telegram, it only rose one foot six inches in 25 days.

<p>Germany Reiterates Inability to Pay and Refuses to Issue Promissory Notes</p>
<p>French Representatives Still Firmly Refuse to Cancel All Reparations</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 27th - Before 5 p.m. today, German and French representatives reopened direct negotiations, but there was still little progress in reconciling the German and French positions. German Finance Minister Kroisegg first refuted the argument of French Finance Minister Martin last Friday, reiterating Germany's inability to pay reparations. He then outlined Germany's proposed economic recovery plan as a reward for the cancellation of political debts. The German Prime Minister then explained this further. Then both sides argued fiercely. The French Prime Minister made several important reservations, but it was heard that everyone was able to speak frankly during the debate. Although no concrete results were obtained, it was not without hope. The meeting adjourned at about 8 p.m. German Prime Minister von Papen then drove to meet with British Prime Minister MacDonald to report on the latest progress. Later, French Prime Minister Herriot also visited the British Prime Minister for a long talk. It is heard that the Franco-German negotiations will be suspended for two days at the request of the French side, so that the French representatives can make a detailed reply to Germany's proposals today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 27th - During the meeting of the German and French delegations today, the German representatives read a 20-page statement. The statement did not add any practical suggestions as expected by the French side, but only reiterated that the cancellation of reparations is the only reliable way to restore world vitality, and said that Germany can no longer pay reparations and is unwilling to issue any promissory notes, which would hinder its future.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 27th - Today, the French Prime Minister told French journalists that Germany's plan to cancel reparations is not acceptable to France. However, our reply will take time. Perhaps at the meeting with the German representatives on Wednesday morning, Mr. Martin (Finance Minister) will be able to present a complete reply.</p>
<p>Havas, Lausanne, 27th - After the meeting of the Franco-German delegations, the following announcement was issued: "The German Finance Minister, in the parliament, explained in detail the reasons why he believed that reparations should be cancelled, as well as the initial measures he expected to restore the European economy. Prime Minister von Papen explained and supplemented the general views of the Finance Minister's declaration. Prime Minister Herriot raised several reservations that he considered indispensable, and then the meeting adjourned. The next meeting is scheduled to be held at 10 a.m. on Wednesday morning."</p>

Regarding the meeting's proceedings, neither British Prime Minister MacDonald, French Prime Minister Herriot, nor German Prime Minister von Papen made any statements. It is said that the purpose of the meeting was to break the deadlock caused by Germany and France each adhering to their own views and refusing to compromise. German Foreign Minister Neurath, French Finance Minister Martin, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, and expert Leith-Ross all participated in the meeting.</p>

<p>Advocating Repeal of Prohibition and Reduction of Tax Rates</p>
<p>Roosevelt Most Likely to be Nominated for President</p>
<p>Reuters, Chicago, 27th - The Democratic Party Convention opened here today, attended by 1,154 delegates from various places. Senator Barkley of Kentucky delivered the opening remarks, advocating the repeal of prohibition, reduction of tax rates, and the convening of an international business conference to open up world trade routes. The banking system and government subsidies for agriculture should also be handled as much as possible.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Chicago, 28th - Governor Roosevelt of New York is the most likely to be nominated for president by the Democratic Party. Roosevelt suddenly sent an urgent telegram to his campaign manager, Farley, saying: "Please ask all friends who support his election not to engage in changing the Democratic Party platform, which requires a two-thirds vote to be elected," because he does not want to cause internal disputes within the party. According to the Democratic Party's platform, the election of a presidential candidate requires more than two-thirds of the attendees of the convention to be valid. Therefore, Roosevelt's election as a presidential candidate requires at least 750 votes to be hopeful. However, according to recent statistics, Roosevelt has indeed obtained 664 supporting votes, while 417 oppose Roosevelt, and about 73 are unverifiable. Therefore, Roosevelt still needs at least 100 votes to have hope of being elected. Currently, Roosevelt's subordinates have agreed to Roosevelt's so-called abandonment of the attempt to change the platform and are engaging in efforts to win over figures from the opposition camp in order to gather the required number of votes. Furthermore, Roosevelt's campaign manager Farley stated that although Roosevelt has requested the abandonment of the movement to change the platform, he still hopes to change the platform in the future if the disputes cannot be resolved. On the other hand, Smith, the mastermind of the anti-Roosevelt faction, is still singing his high tune, opposing the change of the platform, saying that those who aspire to the position of head of state should have the self-confidence to manipulate at least two-thirds of the votes.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Chicago, 27th - Today, the Democratic Party Rules Committee passed a compromise measure by a vote of 30 to 20. If a presidential candidate cannot be elected after six ballots, then on the seventh ballot, the candidate with a majority of the votes can be used as the party's selection. It is now expected that those who oppose Roosevelt will oppose this proposal, because they believe that all six ballots will become a deadlock, but Roosevelt can get a majority of the votes and be elected on the seventh ballot.</p>

<p>Hope for Peaceful Resolution of German Private Army Ban Crisis</p>
<p>Raising Powers of Each State's Police</p>
<p>Suppressing the Arrogance of the Brownshirts</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (National Society Telegram) - The dispute between the German Federal Government and the local governments of Bavaria and Baden regarding the lifting of the ban on the National Socialist Brownshirt uniforms has suddenly shown hope for a peaceful resolution. A new order drafted by President Hindenburg was presented today by Interior Minister Geer to the meeting of state interior ministers for discussion. The new order, expected to be issued tomorrow, will essentially maintain the previous ban on lifting the restrictions, but will increase the powers of local state police, allowing them to ban the appearance of Brownshirt uniforms within a specific area and for a specific period, as needed. It is expected that after the publication of this new order, the dissenting local governments of southern Germany will submit and no longer insist on their original positions. It is also reported that Bavarian Prime Minister Held had previously sent a letter to President Hindenburg regarding the National Socialist Party incident. Hindenburg has now replied to Held, but these two letters are unlikely to be published. However, it is known that Hindenburg's reply was worded quite gently, so there is hope that the conflict between the federal government and the Bavarian local government will be resolved.</p>

Knox also asked if the British Minister to China could report on the general situation in China.

<p>Tokyo, 28th (Dentsu) - A cabinet meeting to decide on changes to local officials was held this morning. Interior Minister Yamamoto explained the government's proposal and requested understanding. Ministers Hatoyama and Mitsuchi raised objections, saying that this was merely a revival plan for local officials affiliated with the Minsei Party. The opinions of Yamamoto, Mitsuchi, and Hatoyama did not align, and no decision was made. The conflict of opinions between the government and Minsei Party cabinet members on this matter was quite deep. At midnight, Prime Minister Saito held talks with Yamamoto and Goto, and then met with Hatoyama and Mitsuchi in an effort to mediate between the two factions.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 28th (Chinese Allied News) - Manchuria's pseudo-Foreign Vice Minister, Ōhashi Chūichi, and Fukumoto, visited Yasuya Uchida, President of the South Manchuria Railway, to report on the seizure of customs and to discuss future countermeasures. The Japanese Foreign Ministry, concerned about the deteriorating attitude of Western countries towards Japan, also intends to act as a mediator. According to opinions from key figures in the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Japan still insists on paying the remaining customs revenue to the pseudo-state and dividing it equally with China, thereby seeking tacit recognition of the pseudo-state by various countries.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Auto Racing Disaster Case <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Paris, 27th (National Society) - The wife of Mr. Cardina, the secretary of the Venezuelan Embassy in France, is the daughter of the Venezuelan president. Last week, during an auto race at the Purolone-Linsay track, her car suddenly veered off the track and injured about twenty people. Today, the Paris police court questioned the case. The defendant's lawyer requested that Mrs. Cardina be granted the privilege of diplomatic extraterritoriality (i.e., not subject to the laws of the host country) and demanded that the case be dismissed. The prosecutor strongly protested, and it has now become a legal point of contention. Today, all the newspapers in Paris also do not recognize the legitimacy of the defendant's lawyer's request and demand a thorough revision of the regulations on the special rights of diplomats. However, Cardina has issued a statement to defend himself, saying that all his wife's actions should be treated the same as those of a diplomat, and that he is willing to use his family fortune to compensate for the damages in this case and will do his best to satisfy all the demands of the victims.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Japan also Feels Thorny About Manchurian Economy <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Colonial Affairs Establishes a Public-Private Deliberative Council</p>
<p>Hoping to Solve Agricultural Difficulties</p>
<p>Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reports that people in Japan, both in and out of government, have high expectations for the revitalization of the Manchurian economy. However, due to the global economic panic of recent years and the deterioration of the domestic financial situation, many people are pessimistic about the future of the Manchurian economy. Now, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has established a public-private deliberative council as a passive measure to win back public confidence. However, the relationship between agriculture in Manchuria and agriculture in the interior is very close, making it very difficult to solve this problem. This is because domestic rural areas are currently in dire straits, and the government is unable to help itself, let alone develop Manchuria. The same is true for forestry and mining. The general view is that if huge amounts of capital are spent on development, it will inevitably put pressure on the same industries in the interior. Moreover, investing in newly developed Manchurian industries is not only unprofitable, but also less secure than operating businesses in the interior. Therefore, recently, people in the interior have been hesitant and unwilling to invest in Manchuria easily. As for other various industries, due to raw materials, labor, and other factors, establishing factories in Manchuria would also greatly impact the products manufactured in the interior. Furthermore, the five-year plan to revitalize domestic industry is bound to be fundamentally shaken due to the Manchurian situation. However, if we only consider the interior, we will not be able to achieve the goal of Manchurian revitalization. Regarding the iron imported from Manchuria recently, the Manchurian side is quite dissatisfied. In addition, there are many urgent cases to be resolved. Although the Ministry of Colonial Affairs is determined to study countermeasures, whether they can proceed smoothly is also a major question.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Wang Jingwei Explains the Meaning of Long-Term Resistance <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>It is Definitely Not Relying on Military Force Alone</p>
<p>Finance and Education Must Be Strengthened First</p>
<p>The Failure to Aid Shanghai Was Due to the Communists</p>
<p>Opium Monopoly Not Yet Decided</p>
<p>The Kuomintang Central Committee's Office in Nanjing held a memorial week ceremony on the morning of the 27th, with Wang Zhaoming giving a report. The following is a transcript of his speech:</p>
<p>"Comrades, today the Central Party Headquarters asked me to report on the work of the past week. Before I report, I must first explain to you that the memorial week report can be divided into two types. One is a discussion of a certain issue or a certain system from a theoretical perspective. This type of report does not need to be kept secret and can be fully disclosed in the newspapers for everyone to discuss and criticize. The other is a factual report, which is different from the former. (Omission) After the Shanghai armistice, the situation in the Northeast remains serious. To give an analogy, two people are fighting. One person is holding the other person's throat with one hand and punching his chest with the other. The September 18th Incident was as if our throat was being held by someone's hand, and the January 28th Incident continued to occur, as if our chest was being punched. After the Shanghai armistice, the other party's hand that was punching the chest has been released, but he can hold our throat with both hands. At the same time, we can also resist him with both hands. Therefore, it is natural for Japan to transfer its troops from Shanghai to the Northeast, and it is also natural for us to concentrate the strength of the whole country in the Northeast. If we cannot concentrate our strength, then we are abandoning ourselves. This is no different from someone holding our throat with all their might, while we wait to die with our hands tied. (Omission) In this serious situation, what should we do? The so-called long-term resistance does not rely on military force alone. We must start from various aspects, at least finance and education, material and spiritual, at the same time. If we only use military force for long-term resistance, then we misunderstand the meaning of long-term resistance. It is like a person can fight with others only when his body is strong. But what are the conditions for making the body strong? At least we must achieve spiritual and material fulfillment. Therefore, for long-term resistance, we must first fulfill all aspects of finance and education before we can carry out long-term resistance. It is definitely not relying on military force alone. This time, Comrade Song and Comrade Luo from the financial and diplomatic authorities went to Beiping for this purpose. Now some people are questioning why we are still suppressing the communists while resisting Japan. Regarding this point, we must explain. In principle, we are all Chinese compatriots. At this critical time of survival, we should unite and overcome the national crisis together. For years, our party comrades have been divided and fighting each other, which is a fact. However, after the September 18th Incident, the slogan "Unite sincerely and overcome the national crisis together" immediately dispelled the fact that we were divided and fighting each other, so that everyone could concentrate on overcoming the national crisis together. Our party comrades can unite, so why can't the people of the whole country? Therefore, in principle, it is correct. But the fact is still the fact. The Communist Party not only has no intention of overcoming the national crisis with us, but also wants to overthrow the Kuomintang and the Republic of China during the national crisis. This is a fact, clearly placed before us. When the January 28th Incident occurred, we could not announce the facts due to military considerations. Now that time has passed, we might as well explain to you. Since the January 28th Incident, the people have been questioning the government why it did not send reinforcements. In fact, at that time, most of the government's troops were being held back by the Communist Party in the Jiangxi area. For example, the 18th Army of Chen Cheng's department was in a stalemate with the Communist Party in Ganzhou, subject to various constraints, and could not be transferred. Another example is Jiang Dingwen's 9th Division, which was transferred to Shanghai. It could have arrived in Shanghai on February 24th, at least Liuhe would not have been threatened by Japan. However, it passed through Jiangxi and Fujian to enter Zhejiang. It was attacked by the Communist Party along the way, and it was only able to arrive in Shanghai on March 5th. This is very obvious. The Communist Party does not allow us to go to the aid of Shanghai, does not allow us to save the country, which is a very obvious fact. Therefore, now Comrade He Yingqin is serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in Fujian and Jiangxi, and Comrade Chiang Kai-shek is serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in Henan, Hubei and Anhui, working hard on the bandit suppression work, hoping to eliminate the communist bandits in the five provinces before they can join forces to resist foreign aggression. As for the northern military affairs, they are also being planned there at the same time. (Omission) As for finance, Comrade Song Ziwen's resignation is of extremely serious significance. Everyone is now aware of the financial difficulties. For the past six months, the government has not issued public bonds due to the shortage of military and government expenses, and has only maintained itself by exhausting tax revenues, resulting in only 50% of military and government expenses being paid, and no temporary expenses being settled. We know that we can no longer reduce spending, and although some people have mentioned opening up new sources of revenue, such as the opium monopoly, although the law is good, the essence of the opium monopoly, which aims to ban it through taxation, is that licenses are not issued to those who have not smoked, and those who have smoked are allowed to buy and smoke according to the amount specified in the license, and the amount specified in the license is subject to the principle of decreasing until they quit. Therefore, the opium monopoly can not only allow the government to obtain a large amount of revenue, but also vigorously implement smoking cessation. However, if the wrong person is in charge, it can be used in the name of the opium monopoly to grow and sell opium on a large scale, inevitably turning all 400 million people into opium addicts. Therefore, the opium monopoly cannot be carried out casually. For example, the government of a certain province does not allow people to grow opium or sell opium, but he alone grows and sells it. Opium seedlings are all over the province and are all privately owned by him. When there is too much opium, he refines it into heroin and sells it everywhere. This kind of opium monopoly is simply a destruction of the race, not only will the country be destroyed. (Omission) I believe that finance should depend on politics. Politics must be enlightened before finance can be enriched. Therefore, financial enrichment is the result of political enlightenment, not the cause of political enlightenment. If someone asks me if I have a way to deal with finance, I would ask him if he has a way to enlighten politics. Therefore, today we must make the greatest determination to thoroughly reform the politics of the provinces, and a certain province in particular must take the first step in reform. This is the best way to preserve territory, and it is also the best way to recover lost territory. It is a prerequisite for promoting financial improvement and educational improvement. Please work together. This is a brief report from me today." (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Harbin Residents Harassed <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Japanese-Controlled Pseudo-Police Search Civilian Households</p>
<p>Citywide Search Held Late on the 22nd</p>
<p>Residents Awakened from Dreams, Panicked and Helpless</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch, Japanese military police in Harbin are searching for so-called bandits, abusing their power against Chinese people, and arresting and detaining them, which has aroused general resentment among foreigners. However, the Japanese side cannot stop the operation because of this, so they ordered Xi Qia to order Ji Xing, the pseudo-Jilin provincial police commander, to come to Harbin, using the pretext of preventing communism and consolidating local security, to organize the city's security headquarters, command the city's military police, prevent everything, and assist the Japanese military police. The regulations were all drafted by the Japanese side, stipulating that a citywide inspection or partial search should be conducted every three to five days. The headquarters was established on the 21st. At 11 pm that night, Ji Xing was ordered by the Japanese side to convene a meeting of pseudo-military police officers to secretly discuss the method of searching the city. They departed at 1 am on the 22nd. The city was heavily guarded by military police in shifts. The remaining military police, in groups of five or six, led by Japanese military police, searched for the places of Chinese people revealed in their secret letters, either jumping over walls directly or prying open doors. Because it was late at night, the merchants and residents who were searched were all awakened from their sleep. Those who were timid did not dare to open the door to look out, and if they were slow to respond, they would often break in directly. Therefore, many people were either beaten or arrested. At the same time, inspections were also carried out on various streets and alleys. Various vehicles coming and going, except those used by the government, which were covered with red gauze on the headlights to show identification, were all subject to inspection. Among the passengers, if there were diaries with words that the inspectors did not understand, they would be arrested under the guise of being plainclothes soldiers or Zhang Xueliang's secret envoys. Those who were allowed to pass were issued a permit indicating that they had been inspected. Such harassment continued all night, and the whole city was in turmoil until about 6 am on the 22nd, when it finally ended. As a result of the search, eleven Chinese people were identified as plainclothes soldiers, and five Chinese people were identified as secret envoys and were detained separately in the pseudo-Binjiang Public Security Bureau and the Japanese military police's Daowai branch. Zhao Chantang, the manager of the Tongji Commercial Firm, a law-abiding businessman in Harbin, was arrested for having a copy of the Three Principles of the People and was later released on bail by the Chamber of Commerce. The remaining eleven people were released after providing a guarantee, and three people were still detained in the Japanese military police headquarters, and one person was detained in the pseudo-Binjiang Public Security Bureau. This kind of search will be held again in about five or six days. People in Harbin now feel that it is difficult to live in Chang'an. When the military police searched Daowai that day, they received a secret letter saying that the Huadong Company (insurance company) of the Binjiang Chamber of Commerce had anti-animal goods. After searching without finding anything, they uncovered the roof and searched for a long time, but still found nothing before stopping. Other merchants and residents suffered countless losses due to this search. At the beginning of this month, Ma Zhongjun, the former director-general of the Heilongjiang Negotiation Bureau, who was arrested by the Japanese military police, was released on the 21st after being bailed out by Li Shaogeng, the pseudo-director of the East Railway, and others. Ma is old and lame and cannot walk well. Now, after being detained for many days, his feet have lost their function. (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Zhu Jiqing Discusses the Anti-Japanese Situation in the Northeast <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Success or Failure of the Anti-Japanese Army is Within the Next Month</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch, It has been nine months since the September 18th Incident. The land between Changbai Mountain and Heilongjiang has been trampled by iron hooves. Our 30 million people have risen up to resist and have fought bitterly with the Japanese army for several months. Zhu Jiqing, a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee, recently went to western Liaoning to conduct an on-the-spot investigation, which lasted for three months. He has now entered the pass. This morning (26th), he passed through Jinan on the Pingpu Railway and was interviewed by reporters on the train about his trip to the Northeast and the current situation of the various righteous armies. Zhu said, "I went to various places in western Liaoning in late March for an investigation that lasted three months, and I returned to Beiping on June 20th. Anti-Japanese sentiment is extremely high in various parts of the Northeast, and anti-Japanese troops have sprung up everywhere. The most difficult to deal with for the Japanese are the troops of Ma Zhanshan, Wang Delin, Ding Chao, and Li Du. The people's hearts are also extremely angry, for several reasons: (1) The Japanese army harasses and rapes everywhere, and women must take off their tops to be inspected when entering and leaving the city gates. (2) Rifles are the second life of the people's militias. The Japanese ordered them to be registered, and then planned to confiscate them after registration. (3) The former Qing Dynasty Interior Ministry's Banner Land is now being forcibly recovered by the pseudo-state according to the maps, and those who own the land are immediately bankrupt. The Japanese are also using Koreans to gradually occupy the land. (4) Chinese traitors are colluding with the Japanese army to extort wealthy households and choose the fat ones to devour. Because of these reasons, everyone is in danger, so they have all risen up. In total, the anti-Japanese army has more than 2 million rifles and fights anytime and anywhere, making the Japanese army exhausted and妄想扑灭 thinking of extinguishing them. However, the so-called invasion of Pingjin before the Japanese army has extinguished the anti-Japanese forces is a propaganda effort by the other side. In fact, the Japanese army does not have time for this. The next month will be the critical moment for the success or failure of the anti-Japanese army. If the Japanese army cannot extinguish the volunteer army in this month, then the green gauze curtain will rise, and the Japanese army will be even more helpless. However, the anti-Japanese armies lack ammunition and urgently need replenishment, and they also lack unified command, which is their shortcoming. While I was in western Liaoning, the Japanese gradually paid attention to me and sent detectives to follow me. After arriving in Ping, I met with Premier Wang Jingwei and learned that there were already some solutions, but a drop in the bucket is still useless. This time I came to Nanjing to report my findings to the central government. The Japanese are now unscrupulous in the Northeast, so diplomatic tactics, no matter how good, are no longer applicable and must be resisted by force. At this time when the volunteer army is active, if the central government does not think of using them again, I am afraid that it will be too late, and they will be destroyed by the Japanese, anesthetizing their thoughts, and it will be even more difficult to recover at that time."

<h3 id="e94">Banditry on the Pinghan Railway <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Red Bandits Claiming to be the Fourth Division Attack Wusheng Pass with Main Force</p>
<p>Tracks Destroyed, Stations Burned, Employees Kidnapped</p>
<p>Hubei and Henan Send Troops to Suppress, Fierce Fighting Occurs at Lijiazhai</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch, The southern section of the Pinghan Railway between Xiaogan and Guangshui has been harassed by bandits three times recently, causing passenger and freight trains to derail three times. On the morning of the 26th of this month, at 3 am, there was another bandit alarm at Lujiashan, 96 kilometers from Hankou. It was reported that a force claiming to be the Fourth Division, which attacked Guangshan and Hanchuan, intended to disrupt the Pinghan Railway. The bandits first dismantled the tracks on a small bridge north of Lujiashan, causing locomotive No. 613, which was pulling empty slag cars, to derail completely at that location. The Lujiashan station was also destroyed by the bandits, and a portion of the guard car No. 914 attached to the train was burned. Stationmaster Wang Gongchang, ticket seller Cai Pingqi, brakemen Zhang Fusheng, Liu Fa, Chen Shuwu, track worker Li, gateman Hong, flagman Yang, and patrol officer Sun, a total of eleven people, were guarded by the bandits and then kidnapped. At the same time, twelve rails were also dismantled by the bandits at the 1012-kilometer mark of Dongshuanghe, and four track workers from Section 274 were kidnapped. Electric poles between Dongshuanghe and Liulin were also cut down. The No. 12 long-distance passenger train from Hankou to Ping ceased operation immediately that day, and the No. 52 short-distance passenger train only traveled to Xiaojiagang. The long-distance passenger train from Ping to Hankou traveled to Guangshui and was changed to No. 12 and returned to Beiping. The Pinghan Railway Bureau repeatedly received reports from stations along the line and telegraphed He Chengjun, the pacification commissioner stationed in Hubei, and Wang Renliu Zhi, the pacification commissioner stationed in Henan, to request the dispatch of troops to suppress the bandits. At the same time, many technicians and workers were dispatched, carrying heavy materials, and traveling to the site under the escort of armored cars to rush the repairs, and ordered the heads of the Xinyang transportation, mechanical, and engineering sections to cooperate in the repairs. On the 27th, continued reports from various stations stated that the bandits had retreated, and five of the kidnapped employees had escaped. However, there were still many bandits hiding in the mountains near the 1010 and 1020-kilometer marks, and the main force of the bandits in the Lijiazhai area was engaged in fierce fighting with the 15th Route Army of Ma Hongkui. In addition to the 2nd and 3rd Divisions stationed in Henan, which had departed from Zhengzhou to Minggang, and Ma Hongkui's troops, which had departed for Lijiazhai, the 13th Division of Wan Yaohuang, stationed in Hubei, had first departed for Lujiashan to cover the repairs. Division Commander Wan Yaohuang went to Hankou that day to command. The 10th Division of Li Mo'an, recently arrived in Hankou, was also ordered to depart and cooperate in the suppression. According to railway bureau officials, the troop strength protecting the railway has been increased, and the damaged tracks can be repaired. Therefore, the second special express train has been allowed to pass first. The bureau had previously telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to report the incident, and the following are the two telegrams: (1) To Minister Gu, according to the telegram from the police section chief of Xinyang, the defeated bandits attacking Huangguang are now gathering the strength of the Fourth Division and dividing into two routes to harass the west, one attacking Guangshui and the other attacking Liulin. The 15th Route Army has been ordered to rush to defend, and the Xinyang station has been ordered to prepare cars to transport reinforcements. Also, the director of the Xinyang office, Zhou Xiaochao, telegraphed that the 2nd and 3rd Divisions and Chairman Liu's special train, and three regiments of special forces, were heading south and stationed in Minggang. Special report. (2) To Minister Gu, regarding the derailment of the No. 11 train yesterday, the situation this afternoon is reported further for your inspection: 1. Since last night, the main force of the bandits and Ma Hongkui's troops have been fighting fiercely near Lijiazhai. Many electric poles between Shuanghe and Liulin have been dismantled by the bandits. 2. A demolition team of about 1,000 bandits arrived at Lujiashan station on the 26th and kidnapped more than ten people, including the stationmaster. Telegraph, road signs, and tracks were all destroyed. Locomotive No. 613, carrying a train of sleepers, derailed at a small bridge north of the station. Many electric poles and sleepers were destroyed. 3. The radio report from the defense forces stated that the bridge on the Yanhe River near Weijiadian was also dismantled before dawn, causing heavy damage. Two trains of empty cars were also destroyed. 4. According to the above situation, the bandits are attacking Wusheng Pass with their main force and sending demolition teams to dismantle the roads everywhere. It is difficult to guarantee that major incidents will not occur tonight. In addition to requesting the stationed troops to protect the area and sending personnel to rush to repair the tracks for traffic, this report is hereby submitted. (June 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Flooding Disaster in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Gan River and Fu River Banks are a Vast Expanse of Water</p>
<p>Newly Constructed Dikes from Work Relief Efforts Also Collapsed in Many Places</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: For several years, the various districts of Jiangxi Province have been ravaged by bandits. The only areas that can be considered relatively peaceful are a few counties in the lower reaches of the Gan River and near Poyang Lake in northern Jiangxi, more than ten counties near Nanchang, and Fuzhou, where transportation is relatively convenient. However, last year's floods caused more than half of the dikes in the counties along the Gan River and near Poyang Lake to collapse. Even places that had not suffered from human disasters were struck by natural disasters. The Provincial Relief Committee and the Provincial Government, together with the Central Relief Committee, organized work relief projects, recruited displaced refugees, and rushed to repair the collapsed dikes. By this spring, the collapsed dikes in Jiujiang, Poyang, Yongxiu, and Xinjian had been repaired. At the same time, seeds were distributed, and spring plowing began. The flood victims along the Gan River were hoping for a harvest to survive, but since the beginning of summer, the weather has been cold and overcast, as if it were spring. As the saying goes, "If you don't use a fan in April, you can see the early rice." Even without floods, the rice harvest would inevitably be reduced. However, since the middle of this month, the weather has changed even more, with continuous cold rain. Even in the height of summer, people are still wearing lined clothing. Those in the know had long recognized this as a sign of a coming flood. Indeed, in the past ten days, the river water has continued to rise. By the 20th, water level measurements at the Water Conservancy Bureau showed that the water level was only one meter lower than during last year's major flood. From the 23rd to the 26th, torrential rain fell day and night. The lower-lying areas of the city were flooded. The Jiaojiao Bridge area could only be crossed by vehicle. Upon inspection outside Zhangjiang Gate, the water of the Gan River had already reached the road. Across the river, a vast expanse of water could be seen. The houses of the people on the洲 (zhou, islands in the river) and along the banks were level with the water. Hundreds of acres of lush and lovely rice fields had become a boundless expanse of water, with only a few treetops visible, dotting the surface. According to reports from the Water Police Bureau, the Water Conservancy Bureau, and other sources, the Jiangfeng dike, located two li below 市 (shi, city) on the east bank of the Gan River, sixty li from the provincial capital, was in imminent danger due to the overwhelming force of the water. Engineers from the Water Conservancy Bureau and philanthropists such as Huang Wenzhi purchased a large number of sacks and wooden stakes to reinforce the dike. Nearby residents also gathered crowds, day and night, to help. However, on the 24th, the dike still collapsed for more than ten zhang (丈, traditional Chinese unit of length) in the midst of strong winds and heavy rain. The area within the dike, hundreds of li in length, immediately turned into a swamp. Residents climbed trees and roofs to survive. The rice seedlings and livestock had no chance of survival. The Fuyou and Dayou dikes, which are closely related to the provincial capital, have also been almost level with the water in recent days. According to the Water Conservancy Bureau, if the heavy rain continues, there is little chance of reinforcing them. If these two dikes collapse, the Yuzhang Ditch and the Guangrun Gate South Gate will have to be closed to prevent floodwaters from entering the provincial capital. Other districts have also reported flooding. According to boatmen from the upper reaches of the Gan River, the Jiao River in Xingguo has flooded, with the water in the county seat being more than one zhang deep. The water level in the Ji'an area is much higher than usual. According to express boat messages from the Fu River, the area along the river from Linchuan and above is a vast expanse of water. The Dabao dike in Xiefu, near the provincial capital, has only a foot or so above the water. Farmers are desperately sounding gongs to call for help. Inquiries from boats from the Yuan River and the Xiu River all reported that the river water was overflowing. The water from all of these rivers flows into the Gan River and Poyang Lake. It is said that the water level of the Yangtze River has been very high recently, with the river water flowing backward into Poyang Lake. The water of the Gan River is flowing southward, causing flooding. The newly built dikes around Jiujiang and Poyang Lake are all in danger. Residents in the vicinity, having suffered the hardship of displacement and starvation last year, are instinctively fearful and have reported the disaster to the Provincial Government and the Provincial Relief Committee, requesting funds for reinforcement. In response, Chairman Xiong has allocated several thousand yuan to the Water Conservancy Bureau for reinforcement and ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate food supplies to prepare for famine relief. The Provincial Relief Committee has sent a telegram to the central government requesting funds and plans to organize emergency relief to help refugees who are unable to cook in the water. In terms of transportation, the floods in various districts have had a significant impact. The Dagangkou Guangfu dike area on the Gan-Guangdong Road, the Wenzhen area on the Gan-Zhejiang Road, and the Yunshan sections of the Gan-Fujian Road have all been flooded, and traffic has been suspended. It is reported that the low-lying areas of the Nanxun Railway near the Xiu River are also about to be flooded. If the weather does not clear up, the Nanxun Railway may also be forced to shut down.

<h3 id="e96">Great Flood Enters Changsha <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Areas Along the River Become a Swamp</p>
<p>Fortunately, Rice-Producing Areas Are Not Affected</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: For the past two weeks, it has been raining continuously, causing flash floods. As a result, the water level of the Xiang River has risen sharply, and countless houses and fields along the river have been submerged. The provincial capital of Changsha is also about to become a swamp. As of the 23rd, the water level at the Changsha Customs had risen to 31 feet 6 inches. All the river streets on the waterfront, from Liupu Street to Lingguan Ferry, Chuxiang Street, Banxiang Street, Xiaoximen River Street, Daximen River Street, Fuxingmen River Street, Caohe Street, and the Xinyao River area outside the North Gate, have become a swamp. About 20,000 to 30,000 residents from 5,000 to 6,000 households along the river have moved into the city to escape. The godowns at Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, China Merchants, Hong An, and Nissin docks are all submerged in six to seven feet of water. These shipping companies have notified merchants to quickly remove goods stored in warehouses, otherwise they will not be responsible for any damage. Poor families living along the river have nowhere to live and have moved into public temples in the city for temporary shelter. The cries of children are extremely pitiful. Commercial activities and transportation outside the city have been completely cut off. From the 23rd to the evening of the 24th, the heavy rain continued. At 4:00 PM on the 24th, the water level at the Changsha Customs was 33 feet 9 inches, which was 2 feet 3 inches higher than on the 23rd. As a result, floodwaters entered the city from the river streets. In the southern district, the water rushed in from Gutan Street and went straight to the Xuegong Gate, with the water inside the city being about a foot deep. In the western district, the water entered from the Xiaoximen and Daximen Gates and reached Luopeng Bridge, going straight up West Chang Street. In addition, Fuxingmen and Caochao Gates have also been flooded. The water on Zhongshan Road has submerged the entrance to Xiaodong Street. In the northern district, the water has reached the Martyrs' Shrine and is about to reach the city gate. However, the Tongtai Gate is located in a lower-lying area, where the water is five to six feet deep. The Mingde Middle School and Zhou Nan Girls' School inside the Tongtai Gate have been completely submerged, and classes have been suspended. Only the tops of newly planted trees along the river streets above Caochao Gate are visible. At higher points along the river streets, the water has sealed off the doors, while at lower points, the water is about to reach the rooftops. Small boats are moving along the streets, transporting people. Many houses have collapsed along the streets. Except for large ships between Xiangtan and Hankou that continue to operate as usual, all other ships have been suspended. Five to six thousand longshoremen have lost their jobs because they cannot load or unload cargo. The Dalv Middle School and Guangyi Middle School, as well as the municipal and private elementary schools at the North Gate have become underwater palaces. Teachers and students have moved into the city and cannot attend classes. Car services from Changsha to various places have been suspended. The Changtan Road has been closed due to flooding in Yijiawan. The Changheng Road cannot be opened because the water at the Xiasesi Station is six to seven feet deep. The Changbao Road has not been opened due to road damage caused by mountain floods in the Xiangtan and Xiangxiang areas. Transportation throughout the province has been greatly affected. The losses to dikes and levees along the Xiang River are even greater. The 十萬壠 (Shi Wan Long), 楊梅洲 (Yang Mei Zhou), and other places in Xiangtan County, as well as 爛泥圍 (Lan Ni Wei), 韓家湖 (Han Jia Hu), 梅溪灘 (Mei Xi Tan), 三里壠 (San Li Long), 三汶磯 (San Wen Ji), 施家港 (Shi Jia Gang), 羊湖 (Yang Hu), and other places in Changsha County, have all become swamps. Countless rice seedlings have been submerged. The entire city of Xiangtan County has also been flooded. Xiangyin, You County, Xiangyin, and Hengshan counties have also telegraphed reports of flooding. As a result, the price of rice in Changsha has soared, with the price of rice per dan (石, traditional Chinese unit of volume) rising by five jiao (角, a monetary unit) in two days. The price of vegetables has also risen by more than one-third compared to the previous few days due to the flooding of nearby vegetable gardens. As of today (the 25th), the heavy rain has not stopped, and the water level continues to rise. There is no hope for the weather to clear up in the near future. People are worried about their livelihoods. Fortunately, this flood is from the southern rivers, so the affected areas are only in the southern and central parts of Hunan. The counties around Dongting Lake, which are known for their abundant rice production, are affected by the western rivers. The water level has not risen significantly, and the dikes and levees should be safe for the time being. As long as they can hold out for half a month, the early rice can be harvested. This will not only benefit the finances and livelihoods of the people of Hunan, but also ensure that there will be no shortage of food for the people in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. If the weather does not clear up and the southern rivers affect the western rivers, the future will be unthinkable. (June 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Dangerous Condition of the Grand Canal Project <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Without 500,000 in Relief Funds</p>
<p>The Project Will Inevitably Fall Short</p>
<p>The Jiangbei Canal is the general hub for the downstream waters of Shandong, Anhui, and Henan provinces. It relies entirely on the east and west dikes for protection. Last year, the Gao Shao breach caused more than twenty breaches, with a total length of nine hundred zhang. The fields, houses, and property of the counties east of the dikes suffered losses of over 300 million, and countless lives were lost. It can be described as an unprecedented catastrophe. The breaching and dike restoration project initially faced difficult fundraising and repeated delays. Until Han Guojun, as a respected elder from his hometown, took on the difficult task and established an office in Yangzhou. The entire construction cost was reduced as much as possible. In addition to the preliminary expenditure of nearly 400,000 yuan by the provincial government for the breaching project, there was still a net need for more than 3.6 million yuan. In recent months, thanks to the Water Disaster Relief Committee, the US Wheat Relief Program, and the funds allocated by various parties in the provincial government, as well as the subsidies from the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, eight-tenths of the entire project has been completed despite all the difficulties. Farmers in various counties are eating Guanyin clay and engaging in agricultural work, hoping for a good autumn harvest to extend this lifeline. However, recently the construction funds have been exhausted, and there is still a shortfall of over 500,000 yuan, leading to concerns that the project will fall short. Earthwork accounts for four-tenths of the unfinished sections, especially the materials needed for each section, such as lining, crushed stone, and accumulated soil, which are the most important. The water level is rising rapidly, and the opportunity to rush the transport is urgent and cannot be delayed. Han Guojun went to the province to request funds. The provincial government, facing a financial crisis, was unable to respond. It is reported that they have jointly requested the National Government Water Disaster Relief Committee to allocate funds from the central relief fund in accordance with the amount needed, in order to overcome this difficulty. It is uncertain whether the association can provide as much assistance as possible, so that the entire canal project will not fail before completion and suffer another catastrophe.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Qingdao Citizens Oppose Japanese Merchants Contracting for Pier No. 5 of the Grand Port <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Rumors Spread That a Contract Has Been Signed with Japanese Merchants</p>
<p>Government Officials Have Not Formally Announced It</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The construction of Pier No. 5 of the Grand Port in Qingdao is a matter of great importance to the prosperity and decline of Qingdao City. Since the city government proposed the construction, citizens and various organizations have been happy to cooperate with the city government to discuss raising construction funds, hoping to see the project completed as soon as possible. The Chamber of Commerce has been particularly active and has organized a fund management committee to carefully plan. In the previous bidding process, the Japanese-owned Fuchang Company won the bid with a price of 3.9 million yuan. Citizens opposed it, and public opinion was outraged, demanding that the authorities revoke Fuchang's construction qualifications. Recently, Japanese newspapers in Qingdao suddenly reported that the mayor and Chuanbian, the representative of Fuchang, had signed a contract at the city government at 6:30 PM on the 18th. However, inquiries from various parties to the city government and the fund management committee have been vague, without any formal or reliable statement. The situation is deeply suspicious. The details of the process are explored and recorded below.</p>
<p>The Motivation for Constructing Pier No. 5: Pier No. 5 of the Grand Port is the key to the prosperity of Qingdao's commerce. Because it is deep enough to accommodate large ocean liners, they can dock and unload cargo, which is extremely convenient. The project is also huge, with a total construction cost of 4 million yuan. Although the city government has drafted a construction plan, the pier fund management committee only has 600,000 to 700,000 yuan, which is far from the total amount. Therefore, it was decided to use a method of paying in installments, with the construction period set at four years. After the commencement of construction, payments would be made every four months, in twelve installments. This amount can be accumulated gradually within four years. To establish the fund and maintain credit, the city government and various organizations jointly formed a fund management committee to demonstrate cooperation between officials and the people.</p>
<p>The Process of Advertising and Bidding: After the construction plan was drafted, the city government advertised for contractors in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. Many merchants from China, Germany, Denmark, and Japan submitted bids. For the sake of prudence, the city government formed a procurement committee to review the qualifications of each bidder and decided to award the contract to the lowest bidder.</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>Important News</p>
<p>As a result, the bids were: 孤山 (Gu Shan), a Japanese merchant, 2.7 million yuan; Fuchang Company, a Japanese merchant, 3.9 million yuan; Kangyi 洋行 (Yanghang, foreign firm), a joint venture between Chinese, German, and Danish interests, 3.95 million yuan; Okura Corporation, a Japanese merchant, 4.15 million yuan; Fuji Construction Company, a Chinese merchant, 4.445 million yuan; and Sinli 洋行, a German merchant, 4.875777 million yuan. However, 孤山 (Gu Shan) of the Japanese merchant attached a condition to the bid, requiring the city government to pay 700,000 yuan in advance when signing the contract and not using Qixin 馬牌 (Ma Pai, Horse Brand) cement in accordance with the regulations, so it was rejected by the procurement committee. Therefore, the lowest bidder was Fuchang Company of the Japanese merchant. After review by the procurement committee, it was submitted to the mayor for approval, and Fuchang Company was awarded the contract.</p>
<p>Reasons for Citizen Opposition: It is found that the Japanese merchant Fuchang Company is located in Dalian, and only a representative is stationed in Qingdao. Last year, when bidding for the construction of Qingdao's Qianhai pier, they won the bid with the lowest price of around 230,000 yuan. After promotion by the Japanese Consul and others, the contract was about to be signed, but they intended to change the drawings and regulations, so they bribed a key member of the Qingdao City Government with a large sum of money, intending to seek protection. Unexpectedly, the official presented the赃物 (zangwu, bribe) to the city government, and Mayor Hu Ruoyu was furious and immediately revoked their qualifications, and the German Sinli 洋行, whose bid was about 40,000 yuan higher, was substituted. The Japanese Consul was also unable to help. This time, the procurement committee failed to investigate and awarded such a large project to them, which caused citizens to have deep doubts. Therefore, several representatives were sent to the city government to petition, state the advantages and disadvantages, and demand the cancellation of their contract. As for the lowest bidder besides 孤山 (Gu Shan) Kiln, it was not Fuchang Company, but Kangyi 洋行, a joint venture between Chinese, German, and Danish interests, because the bid of 3.95 million yuan of this company included the excavation cost of 60,000 yuan for submarine rocks. The actual bid was only 3.89 million yuan, which was still 10,000 yuan lower than that of the Japanese merchant Fuchang Company. The submarine rock layers at the construction site of Pier No. 5 are uneven. Some places are as low as several feet, all of which are silt. If they are not excavated and filled with cement foundations, the pier foundation will not be firm. This is completely an engineering problem. Because this point was not considered in the city government's plan, the engineer of Kangyi 洋行, a Dane, who has rich experience in pier construction, specially explained this point, so he added a clause in the bid, calculating the engineering cost of 60,000 yuan. This amount was not included by other bidders, but it was actually necessary to include it. However, the city government and the procurement committee disregarded the importance of the project and the expectations of the people and rashly announced that Fuchang won the bid, no wonder the citizens rose up in opposition.</p>
<p>Rumors of Both Parties Signing the Contract: The Qingdao City Government notified the Japanese merchant Fuchang Company on May 16 this year, after the bidding was opened, that it should provide a guarantee (must be a wealthy Chinese merchant) and sign the contract within one week in accordance with the bidding regulations. However, in the face of the current national crisis, the unresolved Northeast issue, and the Japanese arson attack on the city party headquarters, etc., these events are still lingering in the minds of citizens. Therefore, Fuchang, in addition to finding Mitsubishi 洋行 as a guarantor, had no possibility of finding another wealthy Chinese merchant as a guarantor in accordance with the regulations. For this reason, the signing of the contract has been delayed for a month. However, the Japanese are cunning and scheming. On the 22nd, a Japanese newspaper in Qingdao announced that both parties had signed the contract and would start construction soon, and claimed that Mayor Shen Honglie had formally signed the contract with Mr. Chuanbian, the representative of Fuchang, at the city government at 6:30 PM on the 18th. However, inquiries from various parties to the city government and the procurement committee have not been able to confirm this. Such a huge project, the signing of the contract is of course very important, and there is no case where it has been signed without being formally announced. It is inevitable that the Japanese are using treacherous tactics to probe social opinion and to further promote the Japanese merchants. Now that the citizens of Qingdao are firmly opposed to Fuchang Company undertaking the construction, the mayor should pay close attention to this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Major Fire in Songjiang West Gate <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Songjiang West Gate Street is the most prosperous commercial area. Less than ten days after the robbery of the Chinese Industrial Bank at Yue Miao Kou, Dafeng Silk Store and other neighboring stores opposite were struck by fire, and many neighboring stores were burned. The intensity of the fire was rarely seen in recent times. The fire started at 12:30 PM today (28th) on the upper floor of Dafeng, when a gasoline lamp was being tested. It was said that the shop owner had a happy event and was going to use the lamp for lighting. The apprentice Cao Xiaoliang, who was only fourteen years old and was testing the lamp, accidentally caused the gasoline bottle to explode with a loud bang. The shop assistants downstairs and the neighbors on the left and right suspected it was a bomb. Then they saw the apprentice covered in fire running downstairs. He stumbled and fell in the center of the shop, rolling around on the ground. The shop assistants knew that a disaster had occurred and quickly used cloth to put out the fire on his body. Unexpectedly, the cloth also caught fire, and more than ten pieces were used. Not only was the staircase burned, but the shop was filled with smoke and flames, making it impossible to approach. The police on duty blew the whistle to warn, and soon pumps from various places rushed to the scene. Dafeng had already burst through the roof, spreading to Tang Sanju Shoe Store on the left and several stores on the opposite side, including a meat store, a candy store, and a pipe store. The Chinese Industrial Bank was spared because of its high and thick walls. The county magistrate, district chief, public security bureau chief, regimental commander of the garrison, and land and water police all arrived to suppress the situation. Cai Zhongyu, the president of the fire brigade, ran back and forth, directing each team with great effort. The military and police stood guard to maintain traffic. When the fire at Dafeng first started, there was a visitor wearing a Zhongshan suit who broke in and snatched three pieces of Zhongshan ge cloth before trying to escape. He was arrested by the police and identified himself as Li Feipeng from Hunan. He was immediately handed over to the Public Security Bureau and then to the court for interrogation. For a time, all the shops on the street closed their doors and took strict precautions. By 2:00 PM, the fire had weakened slightly. The kitchen at the rear of Dafeng, which was connected by a cement bridge, was also affected. Therefore, at the height of the fire, flames erupted on all four sides, left, right, front, and back. Fortunately, the fire brigade members were brave and enthusiastic, and Yang Shijie, the inspector of the Public Security Bureau, and his entire team of detectives also helped with the extinguishing, preventing the fire from spreading. However, neighboring stores such as Changshun Restaurant and Zhengda Silk Shop suffered minor damage to their storefronts and roofs. By 2:30 PM, the fire was extinguished, but embers remained, making a rekindling possible. Some pumps were left at the Yue Temple and other locations to prepare for any further firefighting. After the investigation, the apprentice who was injured was the son of the owner of the Hu Tong Silk Thread Store. The family was extremely saddened upon hearing the news. Dafeng Silk Shop was completely destroyed except for the account books that were taken out. Tang Sanju Shoe Store had no time to take anything away. The total losses from this incident amounted to more than 100,000 yuan, a true catastrophe.</p>

<p>Meeting of the Defense Committee: The county defense committee has been established and is officially in operation. Wu Dingchang from the Provincial Committee is the director of the office. A meeting of the defense committees of various districts was convened today (28th), presided over by the county magistrate and committee chairman, to discuss the funding for the defense committee. It was generally agreed that when former County Magistrate Jin was planning to establish a police brigade, he proposed to collect household registration donations based on the amount of household property, dividing them into different levels to collect donations for the police brigade. However, this was not implemented. Now that the defense committee is in urgent need of funds, it was decided to re-propose the old plan and submit the household registration donation plan of former County Magistrate Jin to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval and implementation. The issue of operating expenses for district branches was also decided to be temporarily borrowed from the respective district offices and repaid when the household registration donations are collected in the future.</p>

<p>Misunderstanding Caused by Disinfecting Wells: The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, in view of the inevitable outbreaks of epidemics after the war, sent special personnel to the affected areas to provide free epidemic prevention injections to the people. On the 24th of this month, the Mu'ertang Boy Scouts first came from Jia to Tai and contacted the county government. Then they posted slogans along the way and informed households that they could disinfect their wells with medicine, which caused misunderstandings among the people. For a time, rumors spread among the streets. Upon hearing this, the county government immediately issued a notice to dispel doubts, and the Boy Scouts gave oral propaganda at key intersections. The doctors have already come from Jia to Tai yesterday and set up their office at the Education Bureau. Injections are scheduled to begin on the 27th.</p>

<p>Dishonest Merchants Privately Import Inferior Goods: A certain large merchant in Nanqiao recently entrusted a certain clothing merchant in Songjiang to purchase a large batch of inferior goods in Shanghai, worth as much as ten thousand taels of silver. In order to avoid being detected on the way, the goods were packed into clothing packages and secretly transported to Nanqiao on a Wuxi express boat the day before yesterday, where the persons in charge were changed in an attempt to mix the goods and sell them. All circles in this county were angered by the fact that this dishonest merchant had been privately transporting inferior goods more than once. Yesterday afternoon, the various trade associations reported this to the local National Salvation Association in writing and convened an emergency meeting. As a result of the discussion, it was determined that the matter was of great importance. In addition to sending a letter of warning from the association, it was also learned that the inferior goods imported by the store this time were mostly fabrics with the brands of Double Child, Flying Fish, Four Gentlemen, and Yang Crane. The trademarks, as well as the fabric patterns, were drawn and displayed on the thoroughfare for people to identify and avoid being deceived.</p>

<p>Death of Mr. Xu Jianqing: Mr. Xu Jianqing, a gentleman of this county, was always enthusiastic about local public welfare. Last year, he served as the manager of the Sulian Land Bank. When the Japanese invaded Shanghai, the financial situation in Suzhou was quite panicked. It was thanks to Mr. Xu's efforts that the situation was maintained. Recently, he died of illness. The funeral was held yesterday (26th) with white horses and plain carriages, which moved many people.</p>

<p>Major Murder Case: Jiang Jufa's adopted son Jiang Tianzhen from the fifth district of Wu County, two or three li from Dongqing Town, was secretly murdered by his wife and his uncle and 田夥 (tianhuo, field laborer) due to their adultery. His body was cut into three sections and moved to a mulberry field near Xuejiatou Village in Cheng County for burial. Recently, Yang Kongyi, the chief prosecutor of the county court, heard about this and reported it. Secret agents were dispatched to investigate and confirmed the facts. Then, detectives from the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau took measures to arrest the key suspect Wang Fada, who confessed to the crime during preliminary interrogation. He was escorted to the city for interrogation yesterday (27th).</p>
<p>County Budget Deficit of 50,000 Yuan: The Wu County government convened a county budget meeting on the 27th. At that time, after comparing various items of income and expenditure, there was a deficit of more than 50,000 yuan. After much deliberation, there were few ways to make up for the deficit. It was decided to submit the entire case for review and appoint Lu Yongchuan and eight others as reviewers to convene a review meeting first to discuss solutions.</p>

<p>Rejection of Jiang Hong's Fraud Appeal:  The case of Jiang Hong, former director of the relief institution, being accused by Ji Sha for fraudulent acquisition of property in the 19th year of the Republic, was judged by the county to be a fine of two hundred yuan and the return of twenty yuan to Ji Sha. Jiang refused to accept this and appealed to the Wu County District Court, which upheld the original verdict. Jiang again refused to accept it and appealed to the High Court, which sent it back to the District Court for retrial, sentencing Jiang to a fine of one hundred yuan and the return of twenty yuan to Ji Sha. Jiang still refused to accept this and appealed to the High Court again. Cao Yuanmo, the director of the relief institution, also participated, presenting to the High Court that Ji Sha's twenty yuan was donated to the institution, and the court's decision to return it was unfair. Zhang Yipeng was hired as a lawyer for defense. The District Court Prosecutor Lu Wenqin also presented a defense, stating that the grounds for appeal were solely based on the argument that the two thousand yuan from Ji Sha was donated to the relief institution, denying any intention of fraud. However, it was found that Ji Sha's payment was made when her son was detained by the county government on suspicion of being a communist. Her purpose was for the defendant to find a way to rescue her son from prison, which Ji Sha had testified to in detail. Ji Sha and the defendant had no prior animosity, so her words were credible. The defendant, serving in public office and being a party member, should have known that judicial cases cannot be influenced by money. Yet, he deposited the money under his own name. His fraudulent acquisition of property under false pretenses was very obvious. The original judgment was appropriate. All grounds for appeal were without merit and should be rejected according to the law.</p>
<p>County Party Department Seals "Ke Bao" Newspaper Office: The County Party Department recently received a petition from Wang Xianzhao and 126 other citizens from Beiwai, accusing "Ke Bao" of extortion under false pretenses and endangering the life of Jiang Benli. They requested the county to severely punish and close the newspaper office.  Additionally, Ren Yulin and 194 other farmers from Qingyang Township submitted a petition stating that "Ke Bao" fabricated facts, falsely accusing Gui Nü Wang Yaliang of causing a death, requesting the county to order the police to close the newspaper office and punish the editor to redress the grievance. Furthermore, Wang Tixin and other neighbors of the victim Wang Yaliang submitted a petition stating that "Ke Bao" published false news, violating the publishing law, and causing a death. After receiving the petitions, the County Executive Committee, after its 53rd committee meeting, decided to send a letter to the County Government, ordering the Public Security Bureau to send Inspector Zhao Yuting to the Zhongjie Gongci at 3 PM yesterday (the 27th) to seal the editorial department.</p>

<p>Raising Funds to Build a Water Diversion Dam:  Due to continuous heavy rain, the water level of the Qiantang River rose rapidly, and the sand dunes on the northern bank were eroded for tens of zhang. The stone dikes along the river were in imminent danger due to the rising water. Workers had been hired to collect silk cocoon bags for emergency repairs. Although the weather cleared up yesterday, the water level had not yet receded. The river water level at the dike entrance, which was only a zhang deep during last year's flood, was measured by the Water Conservancy Bureau and found to be three zhang deep, making the situation much more dangerous than in previous years.  Hangzhou Mayor Zhao Zhiyou inspected the area with the Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau yesterday and sent over seventy city government officials to supervise the workers and intensify the defenses. He also went to the Construction Department to discuss relief measures with Zeng Yangfu. It was decided to build three additional water diversion dams. The largest one would require 60,000 yuan, and the other two would require 20,000 yuan each. Repairs to the stone dikes would also be needed, with the total estimated cost being 100,000 yuan.  Besides allocating 30,000 yuan from the special war donation from property rentals, the remaining 70,000 yuan would be borrowed from the banking industry, using the 8 jiao per mu tax on the 100,000 mu of sand dunes on the northern bank as collateral.

<h3 id="e111">Letter from the Huainan Xiang-E-Xi-Wan Four-Shore Transportation and Merchant Guild: <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor of the Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Greetings. I recently read in your newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on June 23rd that Liang Guanying's troops, due to financial difficulties, borrowed 100,000 yuan from the Yangzhou Huai Merchants Four-Shore Guild. The Guild accused Liang of extortion and filed a complaint with the Military Affairs Commission, requesting a thorough investigation. The Military Affairs Commission forwarded it to the Ministry of Military Administration for reply. The Ministry has now telegraphed Liang, instructing him to submit a report on the matter so that it can be verified and resolved.  Upon reading this, we were very surprised. The 25th Route Army Headquarters, due to a shortage of funds, had indeed sent representatives to Yangzhou and sent a letter to Chairman Wang of the Jiangdu County Chamber of Commerce, requesting him to contact the Huainan Salt Transportation Association to prepare 100,000 yuan in military funds. The merchants originally lacked the capacity, but considering the importance of military needs and local security, they reluctantly agreed to seek loans from banks and money shops and pay them in installments. They also reported the loan details to the salt affairs authorities for record, requesting that the loan be offset against salt taxes to avoid losses. This did happen, but the report that they filed a complaint with the Military Affairs Commission is completely false. Your newspaper's report is inaccurate. We are writing specifically to request a correction to avoid misunderstanding. We would be extremely grateful.  Sincerely, The Huainan Xiang-E-Xi-Wan Four-Shore Transportation and Merchant Guild.</p>

<h3 id="e112">National Central University Students Petition, President Wang Responds with Conditions <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Ren Hongjun Resigns as President of National Central University. On the 27th, National Central University suspended classes for a day.  Starting at 8:00 AM, a general student meeting was held in the school's gymnasium, attended by over 700 students. Jiang Jiong, Yu Jizhong, and Yang Deqiao served as chairmen, and Du Zhongwen and Han Pei recorded the minutes. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Request the Executive Yuan to promptly approve Liu Guanghua's resignation as acting president and explicitly order the Dean of Academic Affairs to serve as acting president. (2) In the name of the general assembly, send letters to professors Liu Yunchou, Yang Gongda, Ji Renhao, and Fang Guangqi, asking them to immediately leave the school to apologize to the students. (3) Request the government to thoroughly investigate the corruption of disaster relief donations at National Central University and request the Control Yuan to file an indictment. (4) In the name of the general assembly, send a letter to the former president, Zhu Jiaju, requesting him to return the misappropriated disaster relief donations to the accounting department within three days and promptly remit them to disaster relief agencies. (5) Regarding the selection of the new president, the results of the previous general assembly election should be maintained. (6) Before the new president takes office, please ask the Dean of Academic Affairs to act on his behalf. (7) In the name of the general assembly, warn Zhu Jiaju. (8) In the name of the general assembly, send a telegram nationwide opposing Zhu Jiaju as Minister of Education and request the Executive Yuan to dismiss Zhu Jiaju. (9) Regarding the issues of the president and funding, the Funding Standing Committee and the Student Union will be fully responsible for handling them. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM. Afterwards, all the students, led by Yu Jizhong and others, went to the Executive Yuan to petition. When they passed the Ministry of Education gate, they were fortunately stopped by a student-organized disciplinary team, which advised them not to rush in and to discuss the matter after reaching the Executive Yuan. All the students then marched along the street, shouting slogans such as "Down with Zhu Jiaju!" and "Support the financial independence of National Central University!" and went directly to the Executive Yuan to petition. At 12:10 PM, as they arrived near the Executive Yuan, President Wang happened to arrive in a car and was immediately surrounded. They strongly requested him to get out of the car. After Wang's polite explanation and agreement to meet them in the auditorium of the Executive Yuan, they swarmed into the building, surrounding him both in front and behind. Ten minutes later, Wang instructed the petitioners to appoint three representatives to report the details of their requests in detail. He would then reply to them in the auditorium. He stated that regarding their requests: (1) To approve Liu Guanghua's resignation and explicitly order the Dean of Academic Affairs to serve as acting president: Wang said that although Acting President Liu had left the school, his letter of resignation had not yet arrived at the Executive Yuan, so it was inconvenient to send another person to act on his behalf. If Liu's resignation letter was already at the Ministry of Education, then it could be resolved at tomorrow's Executive Yuan meeting. (2) Due to the regulations on the exchange of notes for Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds, it was not convenient to allocate Boxer Indemnity interest as a guarantee for National Central University's funding. He would need to investigate and reply later. (3) The dismissal of Minister of Education Zhu Jiaju involved the entire administrative situation of the Executive Yuan, so it was inconvenient to reply at this time. Regarding points (1) and (2), representatives could be appointed to come to the Executive Yuan to listen to the results of the meeting. Then, Vice Minister of Education Duan Xipeng replied, stating that regarding the president issue, Mr. Ren had agreed to come to Nanjing within the next few days. If Mr. Ren did not come, one of the three people you designated would be appointed to take the position. Mr. Zhu Kezhen had been telegraphed several times, and I had also discussed it with him in person. If President Ren firmly resigned, he could come to Nanjing. When reporters arrived at the Ministry of Education in the afternoon, they learned that Ren Hongjun had telegraphed that day, saying that due to illness, he could not handle the heavy workload and requested approval for his resignation from National Central University, and to appoint another capable person to succeed him.</p>

The National Labor University has made a unique contribution to the promotion and improvement of agricultural and industrial labor culture over the years, which is an undeniable responsibility for the country and society to initiate and preserve. Although it has been devastated by the violent Japanese, recovery is still easy. However, the disposition of closing it is unbearable for general public opinion. Now, the teachers and students of the Nursing School, with the enthusiasm of patriotism, earnestly request to uphold justice and leave a glimmer of hope for agricultural and industrial education, which is vital to the life of the country. I humbly petition on their behalf, hoping for your care to comfort the eager expectations of the people. The future of the country truly depends on it. I respectfully wish you peace, Ma Xiangbo Liangqi, June 28th. Another letter to Minister of Education Zhu Jiaju and Presidents Yu Youren and Jiao Yitang of the two Yuan, with the same content except for the change of titles, contains the phrase "long-term resistance must focus on agriculture and industry."</p>

<p>Achieves Six First Places ｜ Best Results in the Long Jump and 100 Meters ｜ The Two Jiang Women's Physical Education School Games of this city, due to repeated rain, were not held until yesterday afternoon (i.e., Tuesday). At that time, Father Raoult Road [likely a location], was crowded with visitors, about three thousand people. Although the sun was scorching, all the athletes were in high spirits. The officials of the Games were: Chief Referee Gu Lihua, Track and Field Referee Chief Zou Yinlu, Starter Zhang Yuansheng, Chief Recorder Wang Long. As a result, Zhuang Mingzhen broke the national records for both the 50-meter dash and the long jump. Ms. Zhuang's high jump result was also impressive. It was only because she participated in too many events that she was unable to achieve a special record. The meeting was adjourned as the sun set. Also, the school originally planned to award prizes after the Games, but because there were so many prizes, it plans to hold an awards ceremony on another day. The results and rankings are listed below: 50 meters (1) Zhuang Mingzhen (2) Huang Zhenqi (3) Fang Qiaosheng 6.7 seconds 100 meters (1) Zhuang Mingzhen (2) Huang Zhenqi (3) Fang Qiaosheng 14.2 seconds 200 meters (1) Zhuang Mingzhen (2) Huang Zhenqi (3) Fang Qiaosheng 33 seconds Long Jump (1) Zhuang Mingzhen (2) Ren Yaohua (3) Fang Qiaosheng 4.80 meters High Jump (1) Zhuang Mingzhen (2) Shang Shuzhen (3) Qian Jingshu 1.25 meters Shot Put (1) Zhuang Mingzhen (2) Ying Minjun (3) Tu Ling 8.10 meters Javelin (1) Ying Minjun (2) Wang Ling (3) She Manjun 18 meters</p>

<p>Defeats Cao Weilin in the Final 2-0 Yesterday at 5 PM, Cao Weilin and Ma Xiaoche played a public singles handball final in the China Youth Basketball Hall, which was packed with spectators. The match was started by referee Hong Yukui. After two hours of bloody battle, Ma Xiaoche emerged as the final victor. The two games are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Game 1 Cao Weilin served first. The two sides competed point by point, from 1-1 to 2-2 to 3-3 to 4-4, alternating leads until 12 points. Then, Old Ma roared and scored six consecutive points, taking an 18-12 lead. However, Cao did not show weakness and chased closely, making it 17-18. At this point, both sides used their strengths and tied at 19 points. Then, Old Ma showed great power and won two consecutive points, thus winning the first game.</p>
<p>Game 2 At the beginning, both sides fought hard but gained nothing. Then, Cao's spirit seemed to wane, and Old Ma seized the opportunity to score seven points, while Cao only got one point. Old Ma then added four points, and Cao then had a chance to serve, scoring three consecutive points, making it 12-4. At this time, both sides served eight or nine times without success, making no progress. Before long, Cao's spirit suddenly revived, chasing to 11-14. But the goddess of luck still favored Old Ma, who won the final victory.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary on Skills The two players each have their own strengths. Old Ma is strong and powerful in his shots, while Cao is good at saving the ball. However, Cao ultimately could not defeat Old Ma because his strength was insufficient.</p>

<p>Huddleston's Cramp Leads to Tragic Defeat In the match between Hillan and Mrs. Huddleston, Huddleston had already won the first set and was leading 4-3 in the second set. Suddenly, she suffered a cramp, so she couldn't resist, losing nine consecutive games.</p>
<p>Nutthall's French Stroke Errors Mrs. Mathieu vs. Nutthall's match was over in just half an hour. In the four minutes after the match, Mrs. Mathieu won four games. Nutthall's strokes were completely wrong, the baseline shots often went out of bounds, suicide touches on the net, the serve was repeated mistakes, and so on. Mrs. Mathieu had almost no opponent.</p>
<p>Jacobs' Triumphant Work Jacobs defeated Mrs. Krahwinkel. Jacobs' performance was top-notch. Krahwinkel was the finalist last year. In the French Open, she had a fierce battle with Mrs. Moody. Today, Helen actually defeated her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Moody Remains Invincible Ms. Round had no way to return Mrs. Moody's heavy strokes and beautiful corner shots, and there was no room for attack on Mrs. Moody's iron walls.</p>

<p>Old Xu was spreading rumors, and I didn't believe it. What kind of material can I expect from Mr. Zhu, who actually admits that he is not a Korean, but instead makes me confused. In my opinion, Mr. Zhu will never go against the list. I thought about it again and again, but I couldn't figure it out, so I honestly asked Mr. Zhu.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said: "When I was young, I heard a saying, called: "A mouse gets into a cow's horn." You know that a cow's horn has a big opening and gets smaller and smaller as you go in, until it can't get smaller until you reach the tip of the horn. The more you drill the cow's horn, the less you can get out. In the end, there is only a dead end. A mouse getting into a cow's horn is a small shadow of traditional Chinese education. Thousands of students are drilling towards this cow's horn. Behind the students are teachers, behind the teachers are supervisors, behind the supervisors are directors, and the heads of the department and ministers are holding whips and driving groups of people into the cow's horn. The instructors desperately drive the students so they have to desperately drill. The one who drives the most vigorously is promoted to officialdom. The one who drills the most vigorously gets 100 points, and gets the most excellent diploma. I am just wandering at the entrance of the horn and don't want to go in. Even if someone is driving me from behind, I am not willing to drill. After drilling a few steps, I turn back. Shouldn't I go against the list? Why did Xu ever spread rumors? I only hate that at that time I was unwilling to drill into the cow's horn, so why not happily run to the vast sky? What can I miss about the cow's horn? Today, because of this difference in thought, this trace is left behind. It was also because I didn't have the determination to cut the nail and cut the iron at that time, that this mess was made."</p>
<p>So that's the way it is. My stuffy gourd has been completely broken.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Financial Gold Price Rises Four Liang Three <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Minimal Fluctuations Throughout the Day Yesterday, the benchmark gold price rebounded slightly, but the state was quite flat, with little fluctuation, at most two taels or more. It was often around 752 or 3 taels. The total for the day was nearly four taels. As a result, it rebounded by four taels. People were still hesitant and unsure. At first, it exceeded the 750 tael mark, probably because the silver market rose in the UK and remained flat in the US, and buyers were active. Afterwards, there were slight advances and retreats, and the foreign exchange rate was stable. Suddenly, sellers became agitated at noon and abruptly weakened, falling to the 50 tael mark. The after-market was particularly mediocre, and trading was also rare. Finally, it was calculated to be within 53 taels. The day's developments are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opened well, rising four taels and two qian At the opening in the early morning of August, it rose by four taels and two qian to 752 taels and five qian. Although the large bars were one-sixteenth longer, they were still lacking. Furthermore, the public and private telegrams of silver prices did not fluctuate. Especially Hongxing Bingxing and others first bought in, followed by a small decline of six or seven qian. Then Bingxing Hongli Hengyu and others came to buy, and immediately increased by more than one tael, to 53 taels and five qian. Shortly thereafter, Dadecheng Shunli sold off, and then decreased by two taels, to 51 taels and three qian. The exchange rate was still flat. This month's US dollars are calculated to be 5625, and July is 625. Because Fuyu Yuanmao Yongyifeng Zhifeng Yongbingxing and others bought in, and HSBC also bought US dollars for this month for 625, the price suddenly increased, and at 9:20 it was 54 taels. After entering, general bulls and hedgers came out, slightly dropping by two taels. The price of English gold was not changed, and then it was 51 taels and three qian. There was no major change in the domestic market. The banks mutually traded August English gold at 1775, and HSBC issued US dollars for October at 30 yuan. Before long, Yuanheng Hongkang Yongqian Changxiang Yuantai Futaiheng and others bought in, raising it by two taels, and at 9:30 it was 53 taels and three qian. Since then, the rise and fall have not been determined. Until 10:15, there was more than one tael up and down. Yifeng Yong and other households came out, and Zhifeng Yong Hengxing Hengyu Hongkang Yongyuan Kangxiang entered. Then the price hovered around 52 or 3 taels. Then, Tongyu Run Hongkang Yong Hengyu sold, and the market was sluggish, until at 11:10 it was 51 taels. However, the foreign exchange rate was still flat. At this time, Tongtaichang bought more than 200 bars, and HSBC absorbed US dollars for July for 625, and in just seven or eight minutes it pulled up one tael to 52 taels and seven qian. But the sellers seemed to be moving, and Hengchang Yong Wu Pin Zhifeng Yong and others sold off. Maixing issued 75 for August, and 30 yuan for October was difficult to sell. Then Zhejiang entered ○625, so the price depreciated by two taels. At 11:20, it was 50 taels. Yuhe and the surface people dragged in, adding 1.8 taels. But the suppliers were not slack, and the people's hearts were not firm, and it was seen again at 50 taels. As the market was about to close, Yuanxing Yong and the Dalian Gang bought in, so the closing price was 51 taels and six qian, and continued to add up to two and a half taels, and because the material was raised by nine qian,</p>
<p>Delivering and clearing enters a stagnant path At the beginning of the after-market, it was 52 taels and one qian, and then it was two taels and nine qian. Dadecheng Qian Changxiang Hongkang Yong came to the court to sell off, and then it was 52 taels. HSBC issued English gold at 75 for August, and Zhongfu issued US dollars at 625 for July. After entering, Yifeng Yong bought in, at two taels and seven qian. After 2:30, Zhifeng Yong and others came to sell, slightly less than one tael, at 51 taels and six qian. Later, Pan Gen Mitsui entered US dollars for October at 30 yuan, and Dafeng Heng and others hedged into bars, so the price suddenly increased by more than one tael, at 52 taels and seven qian. However, from 3:00 to 4:00, the market was extremely flat, with only a few qian in the market. Later, Hengxing came out and then came in, and Zhifeng Yong Daxing Yong also bought, and immediately increased by one tael, and at 4:20 it was 53 taels and three qian. The Guangdong Gang slightly came out, at two taels and four qian, and then raised to two taels and nine qian, but the transaction was weak. By 4:30, the closing price was 52 taels and six qian, an increase of four taels and three qian compared to the day before. According to the largest price of 54 taels and the smallest price of 50 taels during the day, the difference is four taels, and the bare bar is calculated to add 9 taels and 7.5 qian.</p>
<p>Quoted price is 5 taels less The quoted price is still 820 taels, calculated to be 70 taels to 67 or 8 taels. In the afternoon, 67 or 8 taels to 69 taels. The last 67 taels, 5 taels less than the day before, are recorded in July at 57 taels, August at 52 taels, water replenishment at 57 taels, and after-market at 58 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions mostly buy in There are constant transactions on the surface, and it seems that there are more buyers. According to statistics, Hongxing, Bingxing, Zhifeng Yong, Hongkang Yong, Tongtaichang, Qianchangxiang, Yuanxing Yong, Futaiheng, Tongchang, Yifeng Yong, and Yuankangxiang all entered. Fuyu, Wanxing, Hengyu, Yuantai, Yuanmao Yong, and Hongli are very busy with receipts and payments. Yuanda Yong, Shunli, Hengxing, and Hengchang Yong all came out. Dadecheng, Daxing Yong, and Zhaofengchang are unpredictable in and out. In the afternoon, Zhifeng Yong and Yifeng Yong all entered. Wanxing, Hongkang Yong, Hengxing, Yifeng, and Liangxing all came out. Daxing Yong, Dadecheng, and Yuanmao Yong made different receipts and payments. Exchange bills were hedged before and entered later. According to the total day, the Dalian Gang came out with more than 600 bars, and entered more than 300 bars. The Guangdong Gang came out with 7 or 800, and entered more than 400 bars. The amount of each number is still calculated to be within 19,000.</p>
<p>The market is closed for two days on Friday and Saturday This week's Friday and Saturday (i.e., July 12) are holidays due to the bank's semi-annual closing, so the gold exchange will be closed for these two days. Including Sunday, there must be a market until the next week.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Foreign Exchange Market Forms a Hovering Situation <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's silver market, the UK rose and the US was flat, and the foreign exchange rate was slightly lower. When HSBC quoted, only Hong Kong rose again by 125, calculated to be 77 taels and 75. The German exchange rate increased by half a yuan, calculated to be 124 marks. The rest such as the UK and the US did not change. The internal UK was flat and the US was strong, but the overall situation was peaceful throughout the day, and the benchmark gold price rebounded. As a result, the English gold was smoothed out compared to the night before, and the US dollar was reduced by 125. The transactions of the banks were still fresh, and only tens of thousands of pounds were traded in English gold, which was a mutual transaction between banks. There were about 5 or 600,000 yuan in US dollars. The gold industry rushed to the front market, and slightly sold in the after-market, mostly hedged, so the price was pulled apart at 41 or 2 taels, and the market price was also slightly less than 4 or 5 taels. However, there was no important news abroad, and the market situation almost formed a hovering situation. The transaction price is recorded below:</p>
<p>English Exchange Rate The internal market only fluctuated by 0625 throughout the day. The selling price in the early market was 1 shilling 7 pence 6875 to 8125, and the buying price was 75 to 875.

<h3 id="e133">Silver Settlement is More Complicated at the End of the First Half of the Year <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market was very light, so the market prices in the early and late markets were not very different. There was not much worth recording in the market situation. However, because the banks were approaching the end of the first half of the year, the settlement and delivery of funds were quite complicated. According to the investigation yesterday, it was no less than 10 million. Other receipts and deliveries were as usual, so the financial situation was relatively stable.</p>
<p>The price of interest reduction continues to fall The "foreign interest" rate was the same for both the early and late markets at 6 qian 9 fen 01 hao 2 hu and a half, which was 2 hao and a half smaller than the afternoon market the day before. The situation was very weak, and there was a sign of continuing to fall. The "silver interest" rate was also the same for both the early and late markets at 1 qian 2 fen, which was also 1 fen smaller than the day before.

The late market rebounded by 7 hao and a half to 5 qian 8 fen 3 li and 7 hao and a half. The transaction was 135,000 jiao in the early market and 45,000 jiao in the late market. The copper coin suddenly created a new market, at 427,000 wen.</p>
<p>There are many silver coins in and out The "silver coins" were received and delivered by the banks yesterday, but there were many settlements, probably because the end of the first half of the year was due, and various collections and deliveries that should be returned were merged and sorted out. It is estimated that the Chinese banks received and delivered 2.67 million bills, and settled more than 5 million. The foreign banks received and delivered 1.89 million bills, and settled and delivered more than 4 million. Various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous collections and deliveries were about 9 million, 1.3 million were entered into the warehouse, 1.8 million were taken out of the warehouse, and the silver received and delivered by the money shops and silver companies was more than 24 million.

The cash was received 7 or 800,000, and the "foreign coins" were made 675,000 for the early market, and 520,000 for the late market.

The foreign receipts and deliveries of the money shops were more than 6.2 million, the head exchange of foreign coins was received and delivered more than 1.7 million, the special loan of foreign coins entered and exited more than 1.2 million, and the small money shop traded 4 or 500,000.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Securities Situation Is Pessimistic, Bond Prices Plummet <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Troop Reduction Falls by 2 Yuan and 7 Jiao in July</p>
<p>The Rest Fall by About 1 Yuan and a Half, Transactions Amounting to 5 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday's bond market of the Chinese Securities Exchange, there were few spot goods in and out, and only 8,000 yuan was opened throughout the day. The futures market had particularly strong price fluctuations, and the transactions were quite active. Although the August period was newly opened, other than the two types of 96 and 6, almost all of them were opened. It is estimated that more than 1.8 million were transacted in the morning market, and about 3.2 million yuan in the late market, a total of 5.05 million yuan. The internal salt tax accounted for 1.385 million, the unified tax 775,000, the 20 customs rolls each about 700,000, the 19 good about 600,000, and the other each accounted for 2 or 300,000. Only 96 and 6 are still clear. As for the situation of each bond, it is because the situation of the times is becoming worse, the war in the south is in full swing, and there are changes in the north, and strong neighbors are watching, which is just what they want to do. Therefore, the future of the times can be described as pessimistic. In yesterday's market situation, the initial disk in the morning fluctuated slightly, and there was little rise or fall compared with the day before. Later, the northern gang sold off on a large scale, and the selling popularity was very strong for a while. The market opening in the late market was even worse, and the situation of supply and demand was even more different. The price of each bond then fell very sharply. Although the disk at the closing was slightly stronger, it still fell greatly compared with the day before. Looking at the future of the bond market, it is very chaotic.</p>

<p>Bad News Is Coming:: Throwing the Wind Is Very Strong</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market has changed suddenly, and the market disk has fallen sharply. In fact, the environment has deteriorated. The situation in Guangdong Province is urgent and serious, so people's hearts are floating, and the financial situation in all directions is unusually exhausted. The inland situation is becoming more and more desolate. At present, the water volume in all directions is rising sharply, and all kinds of bad news are frequently reported. As a result, the public tends to sell, and some yarn factories are hedging out. In addition, Japanese merchants are working hard to invade in the back, and the yarn is being controlled by them. The market is tired, and the selling wind is even more fierce, so the decline is so drastic that it cannot be maintained. However, Rongxing is still buying in and adding chips, and is still struggling. However, on the whole, the trend is treacherous and the future is bleak, and there is no great upward force for a while.</p>
<p>Human Bids Fall Sharply Two or Three Liangs Before the market opening, the human bid was still flat, but it turned down in the second and third disks. As a result, each month fell by three, four, or five qian. In the afternoon, the air in the market changed suddenly, rumors were very prevalent, and the falling wind was also fierce. Each month fell by two, three, or four qian. Statistics show that the total transaction volume for the day was 35,100 bales. It was found that Yi Da sold 2,350 bales, Xiesheng 1,300 bales, Mingde 1,100 bales, and Jifeng 750 bales. Rongxing bought 850 bales, Changfeng 3,200 bales, Taichang 1,350 bales, and Senkang 950 bales. The closing prices are listed as follows. Human Bid Closing Price Rise and Fall Account Balance 91391 Down 27 33,900 July 1393 Down 30 18,150 November 1394 25 69,300 August 1930 29 39,350 November 1397 22 46,850</p>
<p>Actual Flow Is Relatively Active Actual yarn removal is more active. It was found that each gang bought a total of 1,000 bales throughout the day, 10 bales were entered from the same industry, 10 bales were entered from Fujian, 50 bales from Sichuan, 100 bales from Shantou, 115 bales from Luzhou, 20 bales from Changsha, 3 bales from Ningbo, 15 bales from Guangdong, 54 bales from the inland, and 610 bales from Yunnan. The market fell by 2 qian and a half to 1 liang.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Cotton Market Is Brisk in the Morning and Tired in the Afternoon <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. The situation is more expensive than the yarn market. It is found that most of the mentality is that the US exchange rate has been short recently, and the silver disk for foreign cotton is high. The price of Mitling cotton arriving in Shanghai plus tax silver must be about 31.2 taels. The price of standard cotton is only 28 or 9 taels, which is 2 taels lower than the price of foreign cotton. Therefore, there is a lot of intention to do more. However, in fact, the cotton market is already in a stalemate. Because the factories purchased a full amount of foreign cotton last year, there is no need for this cotton at all. Therefore, the prices of producing areas such as Tianjin, Henan, and Shandong have previously seen a sharp fall, which shows the sluggishness of sales. As for the situation of American cotton, it is still hovering.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Finally Falls Zheng Biao opened in the early market, and American cotton rose by 5.0 to 6 pounds. The buyer was excited, and each month rose by 1 qian and 5 fen. In the afternoon, the yarn market was unstable, and there was a sharp fall, and each fell by 3.5 qian. Statistics show that the total transaction volume for the day was 45,600 bales. It was found that Gengfeng sold 3,300 dan, Yifeng 1,300 dan, Yu Chang 1,500 dan, and Tongxing 1,000 dan. Yi Chang bought 1,300 dan, Changhe 2,300 dan, Daji 1,900 dan, Xiesheng 1,900 dan, and Deji 1,200 dan. The closing prices are listed as follows. Zheng Biao Closing Price Rise and Fall Account Balance 12840 Down 25 149,900 July 2800 Down 25 59,200 November 12860 20 165,800 August 2810 40 110,500 Total 486,400</p>
<p>Demand for Raw Cotton Continues to Be Sluggish Actual cotton consumption is still sluggish. It seems that the factories will see a tragic fall in the yarn market again, and there is no intention to do it. Shaanxi flower 28.00 Shenxin entered 92 pieces and sent them to the factory</p>
<h3 id="e137">Foreign Cotton Still Firm <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm due to good news from Liverpool, unfavorable weather, and buying by spot traders. Futures rose 3-6 points, spots rose 5 points. English cotton futures rose 2 points, spots fell 5 points. Egyptian cotton spots fell 5 points. Indian cotton was firm due to favorable news from Liverpool and buying of July-August futures of White Rosey and selling of April-May futures of White Rosey next year by Japanese traders. Pingol rose 2.75 rupees, Omra rose 3.75 rupees, and White Rosey rose 2.25 rupees. Originally telegraphed from Electrical Recording Left. (27th Telegraph)</p>

<p>New York, 27th. Chicago’s Clement Company estimates the condition of new cotton at 73.0%, and the cotton acreage at 38.3 million acres.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Shanghai Japanese Factory Yarn and Cloth Exported to the Northeast <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Japanese-U.S. exchange rate has fallen, and the Japanese yen has fallen sharply.  The Japanese yarn and cloth, which were unsalable in this port, became very active during the two days of the 23rd of this month.  Dalian purchased 2,500 bales of Japanese yarn and 3,000 bales of Japanese cotton cloth, which will soon be transported to the Northeast.  Recently, with the puppet state of Manchukuo seizing our country's customs duties, Japanese cotton merchants generally fear that new tax rates will be implemented, so they are eager to sell.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Summer Silkworm Rearing in Yuhang Declines Sharply <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Only two or three tenths of previous years</p>
<p>Cold weather further damages cocoons</p>
<p>Farmers in various cities and towns of Yuhang have recently paid attention to raising summer silkworms. However, due to the unusually poor spring cocoon harvest this year, silkworm eggs are not cheap, and cocoon prices are extremely low. Silkworm raisers have suffered great losses. Therefore, they are very discouraged about summer silkworms. Only families with mulberry leaves raise a little. The rearing of silkworms is only two or three tenths of previous years. After collecting the silkworm eggs, the weather was warm, and the silkworm eggs developed well. Early batches have abundant leaves, and late batches have also begun their first molt. Unexpectedly, the heavy rain two days ago brought severe cold, causing the silkworm eggs to shrink and delay their growth. Some have died. It is said that the future silkworm harvest will again be disappointing.</p>

<p>Mitsui Advances 30 Bales</p>
<p>Since the economic boycott against Japan, the sale of Japanese raw silk has been stagnant for a long time. Recently, as the situation has eased, Japanese goods shipped to Shanghai and various routes along the Yangtze River have become increasingly smooth. Japanese firms have also begun to dump and buy factory silk. It is heard that Mitsui &amp; Co. has recently purchased 30 bales of grade B Shanghai white factory silk with a count of 13 to 22 threads. The selling price ranges from 530 to 580 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Needle, Eyebrow, and Pearl Tea Sells Well, Prices Firm <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign firms' tea market, foreign firms from England and France showed great interest in needle, eyebrow, and pearl tea from Lu Zhuang and Pingshui. Transactions were not deserted, and because inventories were not large, prices rose firmly by three or four taels. However, the market for Chunmee was not very developed. Only Tianxiang, Jinlong, and other firms slightly took interest in picked-core goods from various routes and ordinary Chunmee from She County. Selling prices remained unchanged. Waxed Chunmee from the northwest countryside of Wuyuan has recently arrived in Shanghai in the first batches from various tea houses. Although Baochang, Yihe, and other firms have inquired about market prices, Chinese merchants have been firm on their high purchase prices, and new deals have not yet been opened.</p>
<h3 id="e143">New Statistics on Qihong Tea Production <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Qimen black tea is the highest grade tea among domestic foreign firms. The quality of its leaves and the fragrance are unparalleled in the world. Those in Europe and America who value and enjoy tea highly value Qimen tea. Therefore, market prices have gradually increased in recent years. This year, due to extremely poor weather, poor production, and harvest shortfalls, combined with low selling prices, it can be said that this is the most precarious year for Qihong tea in more than a decade. According to Qimen tea merchants, the poor tea quality this year is due to excessive rain and little sunshine from the beginning to the end of the harvesting and processing. The tea leaves were light, thin, and not supple due to water, and the green tea was not exposed to sunlight for drying, so the fragrance was naturally not good. Moreover, the processing and drying were greatly lacking. Every dan of tea leaves yielded only three and a half times its weight in dry tea. This rate is rare. It is estimated that the total number of boxed tea produced by all tea houses in the county is no more than 40,000 boxes, a decrease of more than 30,000 boxes compared to last year. The unfavorable prices for Qihong tea this year are also due to the inferior quality of the tea itself. Fortunately, the number of boxes is not large, and all tea houses have closed their operations. All boxed tea has been shipped to Shanghai. Because the Shanghai warehouses have stopped processing stem tea for a year, the production volume is even scarcer. If foreign merchants have a strong demand, the new goods arriving in Shanghai will soon be cleared.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Grain: Riverfront Rice Market Slightly Tight, Price Stable <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday's rice market had few sources of supply from various gangs, about seven or eight firms. Inventories in the Pudong area remained high. Urban and rural transactions were active. Thick japonica prices were flat to slightly softer. Prices did not rise or fall. Thin early rice was scattered. However, demand was not weak, and prices rose slightly. Demand for Luyang pointed rice was scarce, showing a downstream trend. Transformed Yuan currency flooded in, causing a weak two-foot situation.</p>
<p>New Zha: Yesterday, the sources of supply from various gangs were limited. Riverfront inventories were also scarce. Sales in this street were sluggish. Fresh goods moved slightly. The opening price of northern japonica was stable. Although there was not much thin rice, the demand from customers remained dull. The city also selected fresh rice. The situation tended to be tight. Due to sharp price declines, ocean pointed rice showed signs of firmness.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign rice turned to a stalemate as the arrivals were scarce. Sellers were unwilling to sell at lower prices. Sentiment improved. After the market opened yesterday morning, Wuxi and this street continued to buy. Zhenjiang gang showed even better interest. A total of 3,000 bags were sold in the upper and lower markets. A total of 5,000 bags of small silk reels were sold, with prices ranging from 9.625 to 9.42. Although the market situation was similar to the previous market, the atmosphere of customer activity has turned positive. If sales continue today and tomorrow, market prices may gradually increase.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Factories Continue to Dump Futures Flour <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning and afternoon, prices generally tended to be flat and sluggish. With ocean wheat quoted down by 0.01-0.02 yuan and favorable weather prospects, flour factories, due to a decline in actual sales and difficulties in selling inventories, continued to dump futures flour despite lowering prices, as sales in the north could not proceed on a large scale. The market trend was thus extremely weak. Given this situation, the 0.08 yuan level may have to be broken. As a result, July futures fell by 0.0125 yuan compared to the previous day, August and September futures each fell by 0.01 yuan, and October and November futures each fell by 0.005 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market showed a downward trend in all months after the opening in the morning. Ocean wheat quotations continued to decrease by 0.01-0.02 yuan, and the favorable weather caused significant pessimism. July futures fell to a minimum of 0.014 yuan, and August futures fell to 0.024 yuan, a drop of 0.04 yuan compared to the previous day. Distant months also fell by 0.01 yuan. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, due to a large number of short positions urgently needing to be covered and traders intending to buy, both near and distant months recovered by 0.02-0.03 yuan compared to the morning. As a result, July futures fell by 0.01 yuan, August futures were unchanged, September futures rose by 0.01 yuan, October futures were unchanged, and November futures fell by 0.03 yuan. The spot wheat market was stable. Factories selectively purchased at higher prices. Although the volume was not large, the market was very active. Kaihengjing wheat was priced at 2.93 yuan, Shuangfeng wheat at 2.92, 2.90 yuan, Taicang wheat at 2.875-2.885 yuan, Huangdu wheat at 2.85 yuan, and Anting wheat at 2.85 yuan. Waigang wheat was priced at 2.80 yuan and Shisong wheat at 2.80 yuan. A total of 2,000 bags were traded by Shen Da Fumaoxin.</p>

<p>Prices Have Already Declined</p>
<p>Longan meat has recently arrived in general. Sales are also not large. Checking the market shows that the number of purchases is limited. However, sales are sluggish, and prices have declined. It is heard that first-grade Guangzhou longan meat recently opened at 50 taels. Hainan longan meat is currently selling at 41-42 taels, second-grade at 40 taels, and lower-grade at 12-13 taels.

<p>Since the arrival of Eastern goods, the market for galvanized iron sheets has been exceptionally good. Shipments are booming. However, recently many goods have arrived, and the Construction Committee has also released large quantities of goods to the shops. Therefore, the market is heavily stockpiled. In terms of sales, except for a few points from factories and various gangs in the Yangtze River inland, everyone is buying and selling normally. Therefore, the market situation is sluggish, and the standard is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. The current market price is estimated at 0.089 yuan per sheet for 7-foot, 0.079 yuan for 6-foot-7, 11.25 taels per picul for 28-gauge, 10.04 taels for 26-gauge, and 9.5 taels for 24-gauge.</p>

<p>Due to the hot weather recently, the use of various types of white coal dust has decreased, sales have been weak, and selling prices have quietly fallen. For example, Mack dust is only selling for 9 taels, Indian dust for 8.75 taels, Hayden dust for 8.8 taels, Liujiang dust for 6.25 taels, and Great Wall dust for 6 taels. However, although the sales of Hongqi coal dust are weak, the market price is strong. It is currently selling for no less than 10.5 taels per ton.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Changes in World Academic Trends <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>--Fu Ji</p>
<p>The changes in world academic trends over the past sixty years are truly like changes from seas to mulberry fields! Sixty years ago, when studying abroad, from elementary school to middle school, one had to study ancient languages such as Latin and Greek, especially in middle school, where Latin and Greek were required subjects. Similarly, sixty years ago, China was in the era of the Eight-Legged Essay. At that time, scholars had no other knowledge besides literature and art.</p>
<p>In 1880, I went to England. At that time, English academic trends still followed the traditions of the European continent. The English also had to study Latin and Greek. Later, the United States gradually emphasized scientific education. Students intensified the absorption of scientific knowledge, and the study of literature and art gradually declined. Latin and Greek books were no longer read. Until now, elementary and middle schools on the European continent still teach Latin and Greek, but not as much as before. Emphasizing practical learning and downplaying literature and art - this change in academic trends is entirely influenced by modern scientific civilization!</p>
<p>At the same time, our Zeng Wenzhenggong was vigorously promoting his Tongcheng School of Literature, and Wo Ren was vigorously preaching his "ruler, ruler, subject, subject, father, father, son, son..." neo-Confucianism. On the one hand, he advocated policy-oriented literature and art, and on the other hand, he promoted mystical ethics. At that time, the Western powers were gradually spreading eastward. How could the Tongcheng School and neo-Confucianism withstand the tide of scientific civilization? Thus, the Tongcheng School's literature and art and the neo-Confucian School's ethics met the same fate as Greek and Latin.</p>
<p>Western academic trends have reached the era of valuing substance over style, while Chinese academic trends are declining in literature and art, and the substance is even more unimaginable.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Post-War Farmers' Burden <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>--Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>In February of this year, when the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army were working hard to resist the Japanese army in the Shanghai area, the troops near the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways were ordered by the government to build defensive works to comply with the slogan of long-term resistance. After the ceasefire agreement was signed in Shanghai, this project was abandoned halfway, leaving only traces. However, the general farmers, limited by government orders, did not dare to demolish them without permission, and suffered endlessly. The situations in Songjiang and Jiaxing are recorded separately as follows.</p>
<p>Outside the South Gate of Songjiang, during the intense fighting in Shanghai, the Ministry of Military Administration sent personnel to survey and designate it as an airfield, specifically enclosing more than 300 mu of farmland. Rivers were filled and fields were leveled. After more than a month of construction, it became a flat land. After the matter ended, the farmers requested its return for cultivation. Then, Li Zuhua, director of the Property Management Office, forwarded it to the Ministry of Military Administration, requesting a swift return to maintain the livelihoods of the farmers. Later, the Ministry replied, saying that it had consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government to instruct the county to ascertain the number of acres of land, prices, and how to compensate for losses, and to report the details for verification and handling, ordering them to wait quietly. However, on the farmers' side, the farming season has arrived. The return is still awaiting verification, and the fields are not divided. How can they sow? Therefore, they are all worried and hope that officials will not give lip service and resolve it quickly to maintain their livelihoods. Near the towns of Jiaxing, during the Shanghai war, the troops stationed there dug trenches in the fields. Later, after the ceasefire agreement was signed, the troops gradually returned to their original defenses. The Zhejiang Provincial Government feared that farmers would mistakenly believe that these defensive works were no longer needed or would destroy them. Therefore, it specifically ordered the county government to inform the people that if there are defensive works, farmers must cultivate eight feet away from the works before planting rice. Within eight feet, they can only plant cotton and beans to take care of both the defensive works and the livelihoods of the farmers. After receiving the order, the county government immediately forwarded it to the district offices, which forwarded it to the township offices, to notify the farmers to strictly comply. However, according to experienced farmers, the soil quality of paddy fields is suitable for rice but not for cotton. Beans and rice are planted at different times. Although this order seems to take care of the livelihoods of the farmers, in reality, they still suffer endlessly.</p>
<h3 id="e154">History of the Ancient Bell in Zhaofeng Park <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>--Yan Yu</p>
<p>Near the northern part of Zhaofeng Park, in front of a Chinese-style pavilion, there is a large ancient bell, standing steadily on a square stone. Almost all visitors to Zhaofeng Park have seen it.</p>
<p>This large ancient bell is not placed there for the children visiting the park to climb and play on, nor is it used by tourists as photographic material. Of course, if they like to do that, no one will go to stop or interfere, and it is absolutely welcome. However, the only reason why this ancient bell is placed there is because it is worth preserving as a historical monument. This was decided after a heated debate.</p>
<p>This ancient bell was manufactured by an iron factory in New York, USA in 1865 AD. About thirty years ago, the citizens of Shanghai decided to organize a volunteer fire brigade and used the old site of the bell tower on Shandong Road as the central fire brigade station. At that time, this ancient bell, weighing 5,151 pounds, was hung there. A watchman stood on the bell tower every day, looking around for fires. At the same time, there were also sub-stations in the Hongkou and Xinzha areas. At that time, the citizens of Shanghai could know in which area the fire occurred by the number of times the bell rang. As for the ancient bell mentioned in this article, which was hung on the bell tower on Shandong Road, it was stipulated to ring six times whenever a fire occurred in the area.</p>
<p>After twenty years, the bell tower on Shandong Road could not withstand the wind and rain and inevitably showed signs of decay! Later, it even swayed in strong winds. Therefore, it was decided to find a way to remove this ancient bell. This was in 1921. At that time, the question was this: after unloading such a heavy bell, how should it be disposed of? If it were thrown into the Huangpu River, it would be a pity.</p>
<p>At that time, someone suggested placing this ancient bell in the Jing'an Temple International Cemetery. However, the general mourners rose up in opposition, complaining about the annoying sound of the bell. For a while, there was much discussion in society. Many people advocated placing this ancient bell in front of or inside any concession administrative agency. Finally, in October 1922, it was decided to preserve it in Zhaofeng Park, where it is now placed, until today, for visitors to touch and remember!</p>
<p>The diameter of the bottom circumference of this ancient bell is six feet three inches, the height is slightly more than four feet, and the original price was 1,500 US dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Calligraphy, Painting and National Fortune <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>--Han</p>
<p>Calligraphy and painting are minor arts, but the nation's fortune can be glimpsed from them. During the prosperous era of Qianlong and Jiaqing in the Qing Dynasty, calligraphy mostly followed Zhao and Dong, and painting mostly followed the Four Wangs and Wu Yun. The peaceful scene is vividly displayed. By the time of Tongzhi and Guangxu, the nation's fortune had slightly declined. Calligraphers such as Wu Changshuo and Weng Tonghe, and painters such as Zhao Zhiqian and Ren Bonian, all valued style and strength, and the meaning of elegance and nobility was lost. Descending to the present day, it is getting worse and worse. In calligraphy, only Northern Wei is revered. In painting, only Bada Shanren and Shi Tao are valued. The disjointed and strange talk cannot be investigated. This is indeed a hidden worry for those who care about the world's affairs. Yesterday, following the invitation of a friend, I drove to the Yihai Huilan Society in Ci'an Lane, Ningbo Road, to visit the fan painting exhibition. After looking at it, I felt gratified. The atmosphere of the art world has recovered from decline to prosperity. The habit of wild scribbling with a rough brush has become almost non-existent. Unexpectedly, at the end of Yongjia, I heard the sound of Zhengshi again. The ancients' words are suitable to be given to this occasion. Since calligraphy and painting are related to national fortune, at this time of national turmoil, the calligraphy and painting circles can have such a good image. When decline reaches its extreme, prosperity will return. When the negative is exhausted, the positive begins. I will see it at the Yihai Huilan Society.</p>
<p>Short News: Cheng Yanqiu toured Berlin on May 10th. The League of Nations Education Delegation, Pei, opened a banquet for him and introduced the managers of the major drama and music academies in Berlin. He visited them on different days. Students studying in Germany also held a welcome on the 16th. The Far East Association held a grand tea party on the 21st. Guests requested Mr. Cheng to sing Chinese opera. He declined because he did not bring a pianist. They all said that no accompaniment was necessary, but only a solo performance. Then he sang a section of "Tears of Desolation". Before singing, Linde explained that it was a non-war and peace drama. The audience clapped and welcomed him, requesting another song. Then he sang a few lines from "Scolding the Temple". The whole audience praised it. Cheng decided to stay for two months and visit other countries because he was busy with social engagements and the survey was not completed.</p>

<p>Between men and women, there is only a plank wall separating them. It is not high. If someone who is eager to appreciate the beauty of the opposite sex's body stands on tiptoe while leaning against the top of the wall, he can definitely see his fill. However, there are probably no such brave people now.</p>
<p>Although the facilities in such a bathroom are simple, they are cleaned very thoroughly. In addition, there are also bathhouses with more complete and exquisite arrangements, but Chinese people are not allowed to enter. In Qingdao, there are many things that "Chinese are not allowed to enter..." Japanese sell heroin, open opium dens, and smuggle military supplies. Chinese police are not allowed to arrest them. No Chinese soldiers are allowed to be stationed in the city. This year, during the cherry blossom season at the Japanese shrine, Chinese people are not allowed to visit (probably to vent their debts for the Shanghai War):... It is more than just this small bathhouse. I heard that in Tokyo, where the cost of living is so high, bathhouses charge only a few cents.</p>
<p>The Destroyer of Parks: When the seaside park was first completed, many well-lit and expensive light bulbs were installed in the park. However, they were often smashed by stones thrown by unknown people. You install them once, and they break them once. This brutal destroyer probably uses these public properties as targets to practice his own eyesight.</p>
<p>The authorities once offered a reward for this matter, offering 50 yuan to anyone who catches this destroyer, but no one was caught. Why does this brutal destroyer want to destroy these public properties that belong to the public? What kind of perverted psychology does he have? Alas! From this point, I see a despicable nature in the Chinese national character that is shameful to speak of, that is, the nature of taking pleasure in cruelty and entertaining oneself with destruction. Seeing a person (especially a woman) slip and fall in the middle of the street, the shopkeepers on both sides laugh out loud, even clapping and laughing, and no one wants to go over and help him up. Similarly, when the swaggering generals defeat the enemy's army, causing blood to flow like rivers, and return in triumph to receive the compliments of their colleagues, a smile appears on the corners of their mouths based on this cruel psychology.</p>
<p>If this kind of cruel psychology is not removed from the hearts of every individual in the entire nation, will China one day become a peaceful and humane country? I am very doubtful.</p>

<p>— Master of the Studio Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: A Modest Town Awaits the Commander's Banner, Humble Crowds Humble Attend the Retinue</p>
<p>These people, upon hearing that Commander An's background was so significant, and that Fourth Master Wu had been honored as Commander An's only trusted chief of staff, were naturally both astonished and admiring. They flocked to flatter and congratulate Fourth Master Wu, saying, "With Fourth Master's talents, you are unmatched in our county. Everyone believed that you would rise to prominence sooner or later. Who would have thought that you would ascend so quickly, and now you have been promoted to chief of staff in one fell swoop? Our entire county will surely benefit from your light, Fourth Master. Although we lack great abilities and are not worthy of holding your horse or assisting you, if there is anything we can do to help you in this area, Fourth Master, please just give us your orders. Surely, we should be wholeheartedly loyal and serve you, even if it means running errands and doing small tasks?" Fourth Master Wu, being vigorously flattered by them, immediately became elated and lost his sense of proportion. He invited them all to help, promising them various commissions, and raised a jumble of suggestions for pacification matters. Among them were civil servants from the county government, so it was easy to talk about the county government. They suggested that everything could be handled by informing the county magistrate to deal with official business, which would be very convenient. But as soon as Fourth Master Wu heard the words "county magistrate," his eyebrows suddenly shot up, and flames of anger erupted from his forehead. He slammed the table furiously and cursed, "Are you talking about that old dog, County Magistrate Li Pinzhai? Hmph. Hmph. Now I don't need him. He's not fit to be an official anymore. It's my turn to deal with him and eliminate the hatred in my heart, and let him know who I, Wu Siye, am!" As soon as these words came out, the others were taken aback and looked at each other. Although they were eager to know the root cause of this inside story, they were intimidated by Fourth Master Wu's power and dared not ask rashly. Who knew that Fourth Master Wu, in his expansive mood, couldn't keep his mouth shut and lightly told them everything. "I, surnamed Wu, am a straightforward person and don't do things in secret. To be honest, the reason I went to the provincial capital this time was because that old dog Li Pinzhai looked down on people too much. He only knew how to be lawless and arbitrarily set up rules to demand money, but he didn't care about the local gentry at all. Others can tolerate it, but I, Fourth Master Wu, who has always mediated lawsuits for people and made a golden reputation, cannot tolerate him casually ruining my good meal ticket. Going to the provincial capital, I was prepared to fight him to the death, to go to both the military and civilian yamen to sue him."</p>

<p>Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu Presided over the Ceremony</p>
<p>Groundbreaking Ceremony for the Monument Held in the Afternoon</p>
<p>On the evening of January 28th, the Japanese army suddenly launched an invasion of Zhabei. Our defending troops fought bravely and resisted for more than a month, withdrawing completely. The soldiers' loyalty and bravery for the country are admirable. The Japanese plan was to seize the railway station in one battle, driving straight in to force our surrender. The importance of Shanghai North Station in this battle was not limited to the transportation of supplies to the rear and the deployment of soldiers to the front lines. The Japanese plan failed, so they dispatched planes to bomb North Station to block our transportation and cut off our communication. However, all the railway employees, amidst the smoke and fire, still had a patriotic heart to defend the country. Some even served day and night, without rest for five days and nights. Many also sacrificed their lives under the enemy's atrocities. Therefore, the two railway administrations held a memorial service yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to comfort the loyal souls of the martyrs. The monument will be built next to the Paotaiwan Station and the groundbreaking ceremony was held there yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. The railway administration provided a special train for representatives from all walks of life to attend. The construction of the monument will begin within days. The details are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e161">Details of the Memorial Service <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Arrangement of the Venue: The venue was in the open space east of North Station. A temporary bamboo shed was erected, with a plain white archway in front. There were horizontal plaques with inscriptions by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, "Sacrifice for the Country," and Chen Xinghan, "Public Loyalty and Service to the Country." Below was a banner that read, "Memorial Service for Railway Employees Sacrificed in the National Crisis." Mourning couplets were hung on both sides of the gate, all the way to Baoshan Road. The venue was also filled with mourning couplets. The altar was in the center of the north end, with the Party and National emblem and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, as well as the portraits of the martyred employees. The altar table was set with flowers and spirit tablets, inscribed with "The Spirit Tablets of Railway Employees Sacrificed in the National Crisis." In front of the tablets were offerings. The flower wreaths presented by Chiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, and others were placed in front of the altar. To the right of the altar was the seating area for the families of the martyred employees, and in front of it was the military band. To the left of the altar was the seating area for the representatives attending the ceremony, and in front of it was the seating area for the guests.</p>
<p>Attendees: Including Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu, Counselor of the Ministry of Railways Gu Zhengding, Mayor Wu's representative Chen Kecheng, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce representative Wang Xiaolai, High Court representative Shen Jiayi, Local Court representative Wang Xun, International Trade Bureau representative Cao Sen, Social Affairs Bureau representative Hou Dachun, as well as the directors of the two railway administrations, Chen Xinghan, Chief of the Transportation Department Zheng Baozhao, and over a thousand representatives from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Memorial Ceremony: As the clock struck ten, the whistle sounded mournfully. The master of ceremonies announced the start of the ceremony. The presiding officer, assistant officers, representatives from various organizations, and guests entered the hall one after another. Everyone stood in solemn silence. First, the music band of the Municipal Public Security Bureau played funeral music, sang the Party song, and performed the rituals. Then, they bowed three times to the portraits of the martyred heroes, and observed three minutes of silence. At this time, the alarm bell rang loudly, shaking people's hearts, and the cries of the martyrs' families could also be faintly heard. Then, the presiding officer Gu Mengyu delivered a eulogy (recorded below) and presented flower wreaths. Representatives from various organizations offered sacrifices and read eulogies. Then, Min Luoheng, the representative of the two railway administrations' Party headquarters, reported on the circumstances of the martyrs' deaths. Wang Xiaolai and others gave heartfelt speeches. Finally, they shouted slogans, took photos, and the ceremony ended.</p>
<p>Presiding Officer's Eulogy: Presiding officer Gu Mengyu delivered a eulogy, saying, "Today, colleagues from the two railway administrations are mourning the employees who sacrificed themselves in the national crisis. We are deeply saddened. Recalling the suffering of the martyrs when they sacrificed themselves, we are even more mournful. The martyrs' death in the national crisis is very great and cannot be compared with death in disasters or robberies. It is said that death can be lighter than a feather or heavier than Mount Tai. The martyrs' death in protecting the railway can be said to be heavier than Mount Tai. As we mourn here, we should always remember the martyrs' great sacrifice and strive to recover the lost territory and coexist with the country. Therefore, in today's memorial service, in addition to mourning the dead, the living should work harder."</p>
<p>Assistant Officer's Report: Min Luoheng, the representative of the two railway administrations' Party headquarters, on behalf of the directors of the two railway administrations, Chen Xinghan, reported on the details of the martyrs' deaths, saying, "Since the January 28th Incident, colleagues from the two railway administrations have felt that serving the railway this time is completely different from serving during previous civil wars. Therefore, everyone was determined and, with a spirit of fearlessness, tried their best to protect the railway. The railway administration had made considerable preparations before the outbreak of the war, so they did not feel very difficult after the incident. During the fierce fighting between the two sides, our colleagues from the two railway administrations bravely entered the hail of bullets and artillery fire. The Japanese army's weapons were sharp and their artillery fire was fierce. Therefore, twelve employees of our two railway administrations died under Japanese guns, artillery, and bombs, sixteen were injured, and twelve were missing (list of deaths, injuries, and missing persons below). There are still some who have not been identified due to time constraints. In short, the service spirit and great sacrifice of our colleagues from the two railway administrations this time are truly worthy of mourning."</p>
<p>Guest Speeches: Shanghai Chamber of Commerce representative Wang Xiaolai said in his speech, "In this sad memorial service, the cries of grief and suffering from the families of the martyrs are truly heartbreaking and make it impossible to speak. The martyrs of the two railway administrations sacrificed their lives for the country, dying for the sake of the living. Their death is glorious and great, and will be remembered forever. The martyrs are dead, but how will the living work hard to comfort the dead in the afterlife?" After Mr. Wang finished his speech, representatives from the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce Federation also gave heartfelt speeches.</p>

<p>Cries in the Venue: Most of the families of the martyred employees also participated in the memorial service. After arriving at the venue, they were located on the right side of the stage. There were elderly people with white hair, young women with red faces, and young children. When they entered the venue, their eyes were already swollen and red from crying. When the eulogy was read, the tone was gentle and mournful, like weeping, which aroused the sorrow of the families of the victims. Sobbing uncontrollably, they burst into loud wails. The guests who heard them also felt sympathy and wiped away tears of compassion.</p>

<p>Special Train to Wusong: Over 300 assistant officers, representatives from various organizations, guests, and families of the martyrs went to Wusong Station after the ceremony. They boarded several special trains prepared by the railway administration in advance. They were warmly received by the reception staff and provided with tea and refreshments. At 1:15 PM, the special train headed straight to Wusong. At 1:45 PM, it arrived at Paotaiwan Station. They got off the train one after another and walked to the site a few steps in front of the station.</p>
<p>Order of the Groundbreaking Ceremony: (1) Gathering, (2) Officials for the groundbreaking ceremony take their seats, (3) Representatives from various organizations take their seats, (4) Guests take their seats, (5) Standing in solemn silence, (6) Bowing three times to the Party and National flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, (7) Three minutes of silence, (8) Groundbreaking ceremony performed by the officials, (9) Ceremony concluded, (10) Photographing.</p>
<p>Performing the Groundbreaking Ceremony: After the guests arrived at the site, they encircled the base in a circle. At exactly 2:00 PM, Chen Xinghan, the official for the groundbreaking ceremony, walked to the center of the base, took a hoe, loosened the soil, and the ceremony was completed. While Mr. Chen was performing the ceremony, the families of the martyrs cried loudly again, even prostrating on the ground and unable to get up. They were later comforted by the railway administration staff before they stopped. At 3:00 PM, they returned to Shanghai by the original train.</p>

<p>Building the Monument: The design of the monument has not yet been finalized. It will generally be a white stone base, with a square stone pillar on top. Bronze plates will be inlaid on the front and back. The front will have the four characters "Sacrifice for the Country" personally inscribed by Commander Cai Tingkai, three feet high and about two feet wide. The back will have the names of the martyred employees and their families. The two sides may be inscribed with prefaces personally written by the directors of the two railway administrations to commemorate them. The location has been designated in front of the Paotaiwan Road Police Training Institute, with ten acres of land set aside as a garden to be planted with flowers and trees for decoration. The monument will be in the center of the garden. The buildings of the training institute have been destroyed in the war and may be rebuilt as a memorial hall to display portraits and relics for future generations to pay their respects, and for tourists to rest. The cost of building the monument has been decided to be allocated 10,000 yuan from the public welfare fund of the employees of the two railway administrations. If the cost of building the memorial hall is insufficient, more funds can be allocated. In the future, the new Shanghai-Nanjing Station will also have a special room to display commemorative items.</p>
<p>Comforting the Survivors: After the groundbreaking ceremony, the directors of the two railway administrations, Chen Xinghan, expressed his condolences to the families of all the martyred employees and reported on the measures for comforting the survivors, saying, "After the September 18th Incident, some employees of the Beining Railway were injured or killed in the line of duty. The railway administration then submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways for preferential compensation. The Ministry then issued the Beining Railway Compensation Measures for Railway Employees Martyred in the Line of Duty, which were quite generous. When the January 28th Incident occurred, the two railway administrations were in the line of fire. The service of the employees of the two railway administrations was very dangerous. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways issued the same measures to the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations for reference. The regulations stipulate that in addition to providing clothing, coffins, and compensation, the original salary of the martyred employees will be increased by one grade and given to the direct relatives of the deceased. Their children can also attend schools run by the railway administration for free. If they want to pursue further studies after graduating from the primary school there, the railway administration can also sponsor their studies. If their wives and daughters want to find a job to support their lives, the railway administration can also help them find a job. Those who are injured and disabled and want to do light work will still be employed by the railway administration and paid their original salary. Those who are unable to work will be given preferential treatment in accordance with the compensation measures."</p>
<p>Statistics of Deaths and Injuries: The statistics of the martyred employees of the two railway administrations are listed below: Twelve dead, including Ji Youqing, Ye Keqing, Zhang Jinbin, Xu Bin, Wang Jingxian, Gao Shaoquan, Zhang Shengrong, Xue Sanlang, Zhu Yonglin, Xuan Quanduo, Luo Yi, and Hu Dejuan. Sixteen injured, including Dong Yifeng, Tang Xudong, Wang Pin, Chen Decheng, Wu Xiangshan, Wang Qichang, Wu Zhonglun, Qiu Zhiyuan, Yang Gumin, Li Jingsheng, Jiang Guochen, Zheng Daqi, Zhu Yaoqing, Pan Bingquan, Chen Pingzhang, and Tang Asan.

<h3 id="e165">No Reply Yet from Japan Regarding Troop Withdrawal from District D Yesterday <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Our side reported to the chairman of the joint committee and notified Okazaki of the withdrawal of Japanese troops from District D and the three cotton mills of Huafeng, Toyota, and Gongda. At 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, Yu Hongjun, a member of the joint committee, urged Okazaki. Okazaki also replied to our side at 11:00 AM, saying that a formal reply could be given yesterday afternoon. However, no reply was received from Okazaki all day yesterday. Mr. Yu believed that the Japanese side was showing too little sincerity and reported the situation to the chairman of the joint committee, Sterling, in a letter at 3:00 PM, asking him to pay attention to the inquiry. At the same time, he also invited Okazaki to meet at the joint committee and notified the Japanese side in writing of the report to the chairman. Therefore, this issue will depend on whether Sterling can urge the Japanese side to show sincerity in a short period of time. Otherwise, the joint committee will hold a major meeting to resolve this outstanding issue. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Report to the Chairman: Yesterday, joint committee member Yu Hongjun, in accordance with Okazaki's previous appointment, waited quietly until 12:00 PM. Seeing that the Japanese side had not replied, he decided to report the Japanese side's repeated procrastination and breach of contract to the chairman of the joint committee, Sterling, asking him to inquire and urge the Japanese side. The original letter was personally delivered by Mr. Yu's secretary, Langge, at 3:00 PM yesterday. The content of the letter was roughly as follows: "Regarding the Japanese troops in the three cotton mills of Huafeng, Toyota, and Gongda, and District D, although the Japanese side has repeatedly stated that they will withdraw, as of June 28, there has been no sincere indication of a definite date for withdrawal. The situation in this city has long returned to its state before the January 28th Incident. There is no possibility for the Japanese troops to linger any longer. According to the ceasefire agreement, all Japanese troops in Shanghai should have been withdrawn within four weeks. At that time, the Chinese government authorities, considering the large number of Japanese troops in Shanghai, were afraid that they would not be able to withdraw completely in a short time, so they agreed to have four temporary garrison areas as a temporary arrangement for the Japanese troops. This move was for the sake of the Japanese troops. Today, the Japanese troops are lingering and procrastinating repeatedly, which has violated the spirit of the agreement. Please, Mr. Chairman, investigate the situation and pay attention to it, and urge the Japanese side to fulfill the agreement as soon as possible and withdraw the Japanese troops from the above-mentioned locations as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Notify Okazaki: At the same time, Mr. Yu invited the Japanese representative Okazaki to meet and notified Okazaki of the report to the chairman of the joint committee. In addition to the verbal statement, he also handed over to Okazaki a letter prepared in advance to notify the Japanese side. The content of the notice stated that the reason why our side reported to the chairman of the joint committee was due to your side's lack of sincerity and violation of the agreement. However, on the one hand, we still hope that your representative can continue to urge the naval marine corps authorities to withdraw as soon as possible within days. At that time, Okazaki, after receiving this written and verbal notice, expressed that the Japanese naval marine corps was preparing and would urge again, and promised to reply to our side immediately. The talks ended at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Final Resolution: The future progress of this issue will depend on the Japanese side's reaction after Sterling urges the Japanese side, and on whether Okazaki will give our side a satisfactory reply within days. Therefore, it is expected that if the Japanese side shows no sincerity again, Sterling will convene a meeting of the joint committee in his capacity as chairman to discuss the matter. At the same time, according to Mr. Yu Hongjun's words to the New Sound News Agency, if the Japanese side disregards the treaty and still gives no definite reply, I will also request the joint committee to hold a meeting to discuss and resolve the matter.</p>

<p>Mayor Wu the Day After Tomorrow: Minister to the UK Guo Taiqi and Minister to Japan Chiang Tso-pin have returned to Shanghai from Beijing one after another to prepare for their posts. Recently, relatives and friends of the two have been inviting them to farewell banquets. Mayor Wu and his wife have also scheduled a banquet for the couples of Guo and Chiang at their private residence on Haig Road the day after tomorrow (July 1st). Invitations have already been sent out. The following is a record of the conversations of the two:</p>
<p>Chiang Tso-pin Talks: The Central News Agency reported that Minister to Japan Chiang Tso-pin has been suffering from stomach problems and has not yet recovered. His blood pressure is often around 160 degrees and he is still seeing a doctor and taking medicine. He needs to rest. However, because the League of Nations investigation team is scheduled to leave for Japan from Peiping last night, Minister Chiang is eager to go to Japan to resume his post so that the members of the League of Nations investigation team can consult him at any time and convey the government's opinions. Mr. Chiang is now scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan on July 4th on the Changxing Company's Japanese Empress, accompanied by his wife and embassy secretary Ding Shaoji, army officer Yang Tingpu, and naval attaché Yang Xuancheng. The tickets were entrusted to the China Travel Service yesterday. As for the army and navy attachés, they are now returning to their hometowns to take care of personal matters. Minister Chiang sent a telegram the day before yesterday to urge them to arrive within a few days. Foreign newspapers reported the day before yesterday that Minister Chiang's return to his post this time carries the important mission of negotiating and resolving the outstanding issues between China and Japan. When reporters asked Mr. Chiang about this yesterday, Mr. Chiang denied this statement. According to Mr. Chiang, resolving the outstanding issues between China and Japan depends on whether the Japanese side has sincerity. At present, we cannot talk about "negotiations."</p>
<p>Guo Taiqi Talks: The Central News Agency reported that Minister to the UK Guo Taiqi returned to Shanghai from Beijing the night before last and is scheduled to take the Changxing Company's Japanese Empress to Vancouver on July 4th and then go to London. Reporters visited Mr. Guo at his residence yesterday and had the following conversation: Reporter (Q): Has the minister brought the letter of credence from Beijing this time? Guo (A): The letter of credence has not been brought, but it should be sent from Beijing before going abroad so that it can be presented to the UK. (Q): Will the minister attend the League of Nations General Assembly convened in Geneva in September? (A): This depends on the government's orders. If the government orders me to attend the League of Nations General Assembly, I will obey the order and attend. I have not received any orders yet. (Q): The League of Nations special conference is scheduled to be convened on the 29th. Japan has decided not to send representatives to attend. Is there any impact? (A): No impact.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Great Flood in the Yangtze River, Wuhan Will Not Suffer Disaster <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Hunan is Also Building Dykes</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Flood Control Work</p>
<p>Xi Dejiong's Statement</p>
<p>In the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the plum rains have not stopped for days, and the river water has surged. Many places in Hunan and Jiangxi have been flooded and breached. This matter has been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. The water level in Hankou has exceeded 38 feet, and people are increasingly afraid, deeply worried that they will see the disaster of the land sinking again this year. Reporters went to the Flood Relief Committee yesterday to meet with Mr. Xi Dejiong, chief engineer of the Engineering and Relief Office, and Mr. Zhou Houkun, and others, to inquire about the flood situation in the Yangtze River. According to Mr. Xi, the recent flooding in Hunan and Hubei is due to the continuous heavy rains, which have caused the river water to rise. However, a water level of 38 feet is common. The reason why people are afraid this year is because of the disaster last year. The long dykes along the Yangtze River have been completed, starting from Jingjiang and ending at Cihu River in Zhenjiang. The dykes along the river will be completed, and their height will be three feet higher than the highest water level last year. Compared with the current water level, the difference is still large. The dykes in Hankou are three feet higher than the 52 feet when the land was flooded last year, which is 55 feet. Now it is only 38 and a half feet, which is 16 and a half feet away. We can be sure that there will not be a repeat of the tragedy of last year. If there were no newly built dykes, some places along the river might have been flooded already. As for the Zhanggong Dyke project in Hankou, it was transferred from the Engineering and Relief Office to the Wuhan Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau for construction. The Engineering and Relief Office is only subsidizing relief wheat. Regarding Hunan, such as Changsha, Yiyang, and Changde, there are reports that they have already been flooded. The terrain of the above places is very low-lying, and it is easy to be flooded when the river water rises slightly. The Flood Relief Committee and the Engineering and Relief Office have also allocated a large amount of relief wheat, more than 17,000 tons, to the Xiangjiang and Yuanjiang Rivers to carry out engineering relief and build dykes. The Tenth District Engineering Bureau was established in Changsha, entrusted to Mr. Tan Changkai to manage the engineering relief and dyke construction in Hunan. From Lulin Dyke to Xiangyin, Changde, and Yiyang, which surrounds the lake, to Wanzi Lake, a total of 376 kilometers of dykes have been built. After the completion of this project, the Xiangjiang and Yuanjiang Rivers will be able to avoid the flood of water forever. As for the river dykes built in Hankou, from Ertaokou in the north to Dajun Mountain, and from the opposite bank of Wuxue in the south to Jinkou, connecting Jiangxi and linking Chenglingji in the upper reaches, a total of 421 kilometers, which were managed by engineer He Baochu, have now been completely completed. Therefore, Wuhan can be guaranteed not to have another major flood this year.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Zhu Qinglan's Report on Flood Relief <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, permanent member of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee and director of the disaster area working group, reported that in the summer of the 20th year, the heavens sent floods and people lost their defenses, resulting in the devastation of eighteen provinces. Qinglan was appointed to work in the disaster area and will end his term in ten months. I dare to extract the essentials to report to you all. Qinglan has been handling drought relief in the provinces of North China, Lu, Ji, Yu, and Shan for seven years, although the area is smaller, the collection of comrades and their own energy, still can barely gather, as for the size of this disaster area, the severity of the disaster, it has not been seen in hundreds of years, so its relief is not easy, it must be known to the world, relief funds, talents, time, are all related and essential. Therefore, according to its situation, the work is divided into three parts, namely emergency relief, engineering relief, and agricultural relief, emergency relief offices, engineering relief offices, and agricultural relief offices are set up, and then the transportation of relief wheat is regarded as the element of three relief, and the transportation and storage offices are added, and in order to prevent the occurrence of corruption in all parts, an inspection office is added.

Yesterday, the representative and Wang Zhisheng and others from the local Shanghai Public Organizations Federation went to the war zone to pay their respects. Seeing the scenery, they could not help but feel the emotions of the past and present. They also took many photos of the bombed-out buildings to take back to Peiping as a souvenir. Mr. Bao was originally scheduled to return to the north today, but the national federation has not yet been concretely established. Once all parties have been properly contacted, he will leave Shanghai immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e172">The Bureau of Public Works Submits a Petition to the Municipal Government to Continue the Downtown Project <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Establishment of a Committee to Manage Funds for the Construction of the Downtown Area</p>
<p>The Municipal Government’s New Building and Roads Within the Concession Will Resume Work</p>
<p>Recently, as the order of the city gradually returns to normal, the Municipal Government has decided to continue the construction of the downtown area according to the original plan and steps. The matter has been discussed and resolved in the Municipal Council. It is now known that the Bureau of Public Works has notified the contractors to prepare for the resumption of work on the Municipal Government’s new building and road projects within the first phase of the concession. It is expected that the original state will be restored within the next month. In addition, the Municipal Government has notified the concessionaires to elect representatives so that the committee for the management of construction funds for the downtown area can be established as soon as possible. According to the original plan, the outstanding quarter of the land price was to be paid in full within four months of receiving the land. This deadline has long passed. However, out of consideration, the Municipal Government has revised the plan. Starting from July 1st, the payment will be made in three installments, with two months for each installment, and each installment will be a quarter of the land price. The original document submitted by the Bureau of Public Works to the Municipal Government is recorded below. It is submitted for the continued development of the downtown area construction project. Respectfully presenting our humble opinions, we request your review and deliberation. We believe that the downtown construction plan has long attracted the attention of both Chinese and foreigners. For the past three years, we have worked diligently, sparing no effort. Although it is not yet fully complete, it has already taken shape. To name a few major projects, such as the construction of the Municipal Government’s new building and the paving of important trunk roads, some are halfway completed, and others are nearing completion. This year, the sudden outbreak of the incident caused the area to become a war zone, and all projects were suspended. Recently, various parties have been discussing the reconstruction of the war zone, and the relocation of the North Railway Station may gradually become a reality. Compared to the so-called reconstruction of the war zone, rather than focusing on partial reorganization, it would be better to take a holistic approach and make fundamental improvements. Otherwise, the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas before the war were extremely narrow and crude. Even if they were restored to their former state, what would be worth praising? Therefore, to seek prosperity in Zhabei, the North Railway Station must first be moved to a suitable location. To see a rapid revitalization of Jiangwan and Wusong, the downtown plan must be continued. This is the only way to rebuild the war zone, and this can be asserted. Now, regarding the various points that should be addressed in the downtown area, they are listed as follows: (1) Continue the construction of the Municipal Government’s new building (this point has been submitted separately for instructions). (2) Continue the excavation and earthwork for roads within the first phase of the downtown concession. (3) Establish a committee for the management of construction funds for the downtown area and urge the payment of land prices. It is found that three-quarters of the land price remains unpaid. Given the current situation, it may be advisable to change the original plan and re-establish a method for phased payments. As for the concessionaires, the regulation requiring construction to begin within one year of receiving the land should also be extended as appropriate to show flexibility. The above three matters are all urgent tasks. If we do not catch up quickly and devote all our efforts, the grand Shanghai construction plan will have no hope of realization. The Municipal Government’s efforts in the area over the years will be in vain, and the achievements will be lost. It would be a pity. Therefore, we present our humble opinions and respectfully request your review and deliberation. This would be in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Mayor.</p>

<p>On July 1st, the Municipal Government, considering the special circumstances of the city, believed that the local defense could not be handled solely by the police force. Therefore, the proposal to organize a city security force was made. Preparations have been underway for over a month, and now it is largely in order. Regarding the uniforms, submissions have been made to the central government ministries. Recently, a reply was received from the Ministry of Interior, temporarily approving the record. It is now learned that the Municipal Government has completed the tailoring of the aforementioned uniforms and will distribute them to the officers and soldiers of the various units for use on July 1st.

<h3 id="e175">Mortar Test Fired in Longhua <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Song Ziwen Personally Attends the Observation. The Longhua Garrison Headquarters announced that mortar tests were conducted at the airfield yesterday afternoon. The mortars were German-made and managed by Kong Shiyang Trading Company on Jiangxi Road in the city. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the trading company used the French Concession Public Works Bureau's vehicles to transport two mortars (one for reserve). The accompanying French personnel arranged and placed them properly at the airfield. The targets were placed in Shandong Province, along the nearby Pujiang Airfield. The Garrison Headquarters first sent personnel to liaise with Sun Liren, the head of the Tax Police Regiment. By 2:30 PM, those who came to observe the test firing included Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, Song Ziliang, Song Zian, former Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian, Garrison Headquarters staff officers Zheng Youshang and Gu Gaodi, and the Tax Police Regiment commander's staff, including foreigners, totaling fifty or sixty people. A total of twenty rounds were fired, each round hitting the target. The results were excellent. Moreover, the mortars were equipped with movable supports and rangefinders, which were more responsive and complete than previous models. The test ended at 3:30 PM, and everyone dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Record of the Establishment of the China Aviation Construction Association <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The China Aviation Construction Association was organized and prepared by leaders from all sectors of the city. Its purpose is to promote aviation construction and cultivate aviation talents. The preparations for the association have been completed, and the inaugural meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Representatives Attending: Xu Shiying, Li Gang, Xiong Xiling, Zhu Ziqiao, Zha Liangzhao, Weng Zhaojing, Qiu Guozhen, Shen Dexie, Yin Zhiling, Li Cishan, Chen Liting, Wang Chengzhi, Liu Shixiong, Tan Bozhi, Jiang Jiemin, Chu Huiseng, Wu Shan, Lin Yunshan, Huang Menggui, and more than seventy others were publicly elected Yin Zhiling as chairman and Tao Shuyuan as recorder.</p>
<p>Meeting Details: The meeting was called to order at 4:30 PM. (1) Chairman Yin Zhiling delivered the opening speech. (2) Initiator Li Cishan reported on the progress of the preparations. (3) Speeches were given by Qiu Guozhen, Chief of Staff of the 156th Brigade of the 19th Route Army, Shen Dexie, Director of the Shanghai Aircraft Factory, Huang Menggui, Lin Yunfan, and others. (4) Discussion of the articles of association. (5) Election of directors. (6) Refreshments. (7) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Excerpts from Speeches: Qiu Guozhen briefly stated that the Japanese once boasted that they had one thousand aircraft, enough to destroy China. In light of the facts, China certainly does not have aircraft capable of defending the airspace. The existing aircraft are not only structurally unsound and difficult to transport, but also have limited flight time. If the aircraft is flown for too long, the parts may be damaged, making it impossible to fly, let alone fight. Therefore, the business of manufacturing aircraft must be vigorously promoted. He also cited the various constraints faced during the anti-Japanese war. (2) Shen Dexie said that it is easy for Europe and the United States to manufacture aircraft, but difficult for China to manufacture its own aircraft because of the lack of materials and talent. Therefore, it is appropriate to establish factories with Chinese and foreign joint ventures to manufacture aircraft. Air defense requires various types of aircraft, such as fighter planes, bombers, attack aircraft, and reconnaissance aircraft. China has no more than five aircraft that can be used for air defense. Furthermore, they are all concentrated in Nanjing. During the anti-Japanese war, some people questioned why naval aircraft could not be used in combat. However, they did not know that the naval aircraft were only training aircraft. They had no machine guns or bomb racks. Therefore, the only way to avoid unnecessary sacrifices was to move these aircraft elsewhere. Regarding the promotion of the aviation industry, the government may not have the resources or the desire to be comprehensive. If the public can invest in setting up factories, there is a precedent in foreign countries for governments to purchase aircraft from private aircraft factories. Although this is a new undertaking in China, it may be a way to promote production and defend the country. (3) Huang Mengshu reported on the efforts of overseas Chinese to promote aviation construction in their homeland.</p>
<p>Discussion of the Articles of Association: The association's articles of association consist of twelve articles. Five articles were passed yesterday, but due to the lateness of the hour, Tan Bozhi, Yin Zhiling, and Zheng Xitao were appointed to review the entire text and submit it to the first plenary meeting of the board of directors for approval.</p>
<p>Election of Directors: Next, according to the articles of association, thirty-one directors of the first session were elected.

<h3 id="e177">The Silk Factory Strike in Hongkou Was Heard Yesterday <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Labor and Management Held Separate Meetings</p>
<p>Central Government Dispatched Special Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>Since the silk factories in the Hongkou district successively declared strikes, representatives sent by the labor unions negotiated with the factory owners, but no solution has been reached. Yesterday, both the labor unions and the factory owners convened meetings to discuss the matter. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Report to the Party Headquarters: The Fourth District Silk Industry Workers' Union yesterday reported to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs, reporting the truth about the labor strike. The report stated that since the invasion of Shanghai by the Japanese, the silk merchants had taken the opportunity to increase working hours from eleven to twelve hours and reduce wages for male and female workers by 50-60%. The wages of female workers were reduced from 58 cents to 42 cents. All existing benefits, such as overtime subsidies for male workers and rewards for female workers, were canceled. Workers were also forced to prioritize increased output over quality, causing great suffering. The union repeatedly received reports from workers requesting a fair fight. The union immediately contacted the trade association to negotiate based on the situation. Initially, the factory owners used the excuse of the Japanese army not having withdrawn to delay. After the Chinese police took over, the union actively negotiated with the factory owners. On June 25th, a reply was received from the trade association, stating that working hours and careful production had been communicated to all factories and that the wage issue would be discussed at a meeting next week (this week) before a reply would be given. After receiving the reply, the union planned to continue negotiations. However, workers at the Yichang Silk Factory, possibly under the instigation of reactionary elements, acted impatiently and went on strike on the afternoon of June 25th. After receiving the news, the union immediately negotiated seriously with the factory owners in order to achieve the goal of freeing our workers from suffering. Therefore, the details of the strike are reported in writing, hoping for your review and guidance.</p>
<p>Meetings Between the Two Sides: The labor union convened a joint meeting of group leaders and staff members at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss ways to resolve the labor strike. The decisions were: (1) Send representatives to petition party and government agencies. (2) Negotiate seriously with the factory owners to quickly resolve the labor strike. (3) Workers should wait patiently for a resolution and refrain from taking rash actions or creating trouble. (4) Closely prevent reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to cause chaos. At the same time, the factory owners also held a meeting at 1:00 PM at the Hujiamuqiao Fire Station, chaired by Zhang Peishen. After exchanging views, they decided to submit the issues of resumption of work and resolution of the labor strike to the Silk Industry Trade Association's general meeting to be held today for discussion.</p>
<p>Central Government Investigation: Jiang Hao, a special commissioner of the Central People's Movement Steering Committee, received instructions from the Central Government to investigate the truth about the silk factory labor strike. Jiang visited the union on Tiantong Road at 2:00 PM yesterday and met with Chen Xiupu, a director of the union, to inquire in detail about the causes of the strike, as well as treatment and working conditions. Jiang has submitted the results of the investigation to the Central Government for further instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Hope for the Resolution of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry Labor Strike <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Good Results from Yesterday's Negotiations</p>
<p>Peaceful Resolution Expected Soon</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the pharmaceutical industry workers in the city, due to their opposition to the management's refusal to use substitute workers, have caused a serious dispute. Yesterday, the labor representatives negotiated with the trade association. The negotiation results were quite satisfactory, and a resolution is expected soon. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Negotiation Situation: At 2:00 PM yesterday, the Salary Increase Movement Committee sent Zhao Zhenhui, Fang Qinghe, Feng Xingkang, Chen Yantao, Zhu Xiaqing, and other five people to the Traditional Chinese Medicine Trade Association to negotiate. Zhang Meian, a representative of the association, met with them. The labor representatives put forward three demands: (1) The original contract remains valid, and the management shall not arbitrarily breach it (and reported the breaches by various pharmacies). (2) Each person receives a monthly salary increase of ten yuan. (3) Placement of unemployed workers. Mr. Zhang expressed his acceptance of the principles of the three demands put forward by the labor representatives with the utmost sincerity, but they need to be submitted to the meeting for discussion and a formal reply can be given within three days. Finally, it was decided that labor and management would jointly form a joint committee to discuss salary increases, placement of unemployed workers, and other unfulfilled contract issues in order to seek a resolution so as not to expand the strike and achieve a peaceful resolution, so as not to cause panic among patients and put society in a state of unease. At that time, the negotiations between the two sides were very close, and the strike is expected to be resolved.</p>
<p>Workers' Declaration: All outfield workers in the traditional Chinese medicine industry issued an important declaration yesterday in opposition to joining the trade association. To all workers and people from all walks of life across the country: Since the establishment of the Pharmaceutical Friendship Association in the ninth year of the Republic of China under the warlord railways, although it has undergone several reorganizations with the change of environment, the entire organization has never had any shortcomings. Unexpectedly, recently, the management of our industry, because they could not arbitrarily oppress us, actually fantasized about falsely accusing our outfield workers of having no skills and being completely commercial employees. They should join the traditional Chinese medicine trade association, which has no membership qualifications in the municipal chamber of commerce, so as to divide our organization and follow their destructive plot. It must be known that our industry's workers have no internal or external distinction. The initial learning period requires three years. After completing their studies, they must practice for one or two years before choosing to work inside or outside according to their own preferences. Whether or not they have skills is very clear. Moreover, the same worker who is an outfield worker in one store is an infield worker in another store, which is very common. The facts are all there, so how can they be erased? Even if we consider it according to legal principles, freedom of assembly and association is absolutely guaranteed and is recorded in the provisional constitution. Moreover, there is a signing of the entire labor-management conditions. How can the trade association of the traditional Chinese medicine industry threaten and lure us, forcing us to join, disregarding national laws and labor-management conditions, and acting recklessly in a way that blinds them with greed? For the sake of their own interests and to preserve their dignity, we unanimously vow not to join. We will not count any sacrifices. In addition to requesting the labor union to fight for justice, we fear that workers and people from all walks of life across the country may not understand the truth, so we have briefly explained the situation. We hope that you will review and uphold justice, which will not only be a fortune for our colleagues, but also a fortune for workers across the country. This is our declaration.</p>
<p>Letter to the Labor Union: The Traditional Chinese Medicine Trade Association sent a letter to the Labor Union, stating: In reply, we have read the letter you sent. We found that the labor-management conditions of this association were signed in the spring of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. At that time, the National Revolutionary Army had just reached Jiangnan, and the Kuomintang had not yet purged Shanghai. In this chaotic period, the temporary labor-management contract was originally intended to take into account the overall situation and support the revolution. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and the five branches were established at the same time, various industrial and commercial laws and regulations were promulgated in order. All private agreements concluded in the revolutionary process that are contrary to current laws should be amended in accordance with the law. The reason why the central government ordered this industry to amend the conditions last year was for this reason. Moreover, the contents of the labor-management conditions of this industry do not contain the words "permanent implementation." Therefore, if both parties feel that there are obstacles and terminate the conditions privately, they can still do so even without an order from the central government. If it is said that the existing contract cannot be changed, then this association's salary increase plan has already been recorded in the conditions, but your association does not abide by it and has plans to propose a salary increase. How can this be so contradictory? The minutes of the meeting disclosed by this association in various newspapers on the 16th of this month concerned the division of internal and external workers and the free recruitment of substitute workers. The former was in accordance with the instructions of the Central Training Committee, and the latter was in accordance with the instructions of the Bureau of Social Affairs. Neither has anything to do with this association's labor-management conditions. The newspapers are all there and can be checked. The letter stated that this association had completely destroyed the labor-management conditions without leaving any trace. What is the basis for saying that? As for the words "responsible personnel of your association have repeatedly advised us, but it is difficult to take effect," since the incident, this association has not met with any of your association's members. This kind of embellishment has no value in arguing. However, at this time of hot summer and abundant money, with severe epidemics, if your association instigates a strike because your demands are not met, brazenly disregarding the health of the people and society, then all the responsibilities will be borne by your association. This association does not dare to take credit for other people's achievements. This is a special reply to show a warning. We hope you will reflect on it. This is our earnest hope. Addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry Workers' Union.</p>
<p>Reply to the Warning: The Pharmaceutical Workers' Union sent a letter to Feng Cunrentang and other major pharmacies, issuing a warning. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Trade Association replied on their behalf, stating: We have received your association's warning and request to reply on behalf of our members, such as Feng Cunrentang. After investigating, we found that Feng Cunrentang and others refused to send outfield substitute workers in accordance with this association's notice and the instructions of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, which is not inappropriate. Moreover, these pharmacies have always abided by the labor-management conditions set by this industry and have never destroyed them. The letter from your association is completely a false accusation. Furthermore, this time, this association's order to refuse outfield substitute workers is a city-wide issue, not a local issue for a few pharmacies. If your association has any negotiations, it should contact this association to handle them. The procedure for issuing a separate warning to these pharmacies lacks legality. This is a special reply to the previous letter. Please check and handle it accordingly. Addressed to the Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union.</p>
<p>Medical Association's Advice: The Shanghai National Medical Association, fearing that the pharmaceutical industry strike would harm the people's health, sent a letter of advice to both labor and management in the pharmaceutical industry, stating: Recently, we have read reports that the labor and management of your association have failed to reach an agreement, which is regrettable. It is summer, and diseases are rampant. The need for medicines is all the more urgent. We believe that your members understand the overall situation and will be able to work together in harmony to prevent the strike from escalating. This association has a close relationship with your association and is like brothers in the same boat. We cannot remain silent about this unfortunate event. In addition to sending a letter to the Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry Workers' Union, we especially request your association to consider the difficult times and prioritize the lives of the people, quickly resolve the issue peacefully, which would not only be a fortune for this association, but also a deep hope for all citizens.</p>
<p>Trade Association's Petition: The Traditional Chinese Medicine Trade Association, based on the resolution of the Emergency Executive Committee, sent Zhang Meian, Cen Zhiliang, Zhou Gansheng, and Feng Jinpu, four representatives, to various agencies this morning, including the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to submit petitions.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Jiangsu Province Rice Association Telegraphed Request to Abolish Special Business Tax <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>A telegram was sent to the Jing authorities by the Jiangsu Ninghu City and County Rice Industry Association Federation regarding the special business tax levied by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, urging the abolition of the tax. The telegram stated that the special business tax levied by Jiangsu Province harms businesses and harms the people, even more so than the likin tax. Various trade associations have repeatedly appealed for relief. The Executive Yuan and the Ministry sympathized with the difficulties of businesses and ordered the abolition of the tax, which brought joy to the people. However, according to the members of the association, the Jiangsu Provincial Government is disregarding everything and still plans to establish offices and collect the tax starting on July 1st, allowing the government's credibility to be swept away, the people's livelihood to be destroyed, laws to be disregarded, and the hardships of businesses to be ignored, which is shocking. Although this association is based in the rice industry, most of the inland rice businesses also operate in soybeans and wheat. In reality, there is no distinction between primary and secondary. Moreover, soybeans and grains are both essential daily necessities. If heavy taxes are levied, they will be directly levied on businesses and indirectly taken from the common people. How can they bear this heavy tax after surviving the disaster? Even from the perspective of the system, Jiangsu Province is not a foreign land. How can it disregard the orders of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry? In order to respect national laws and take into account the difficulties of businesses and the people, the special business tax planned to be levied by Jiangsu Province cannot be allowed to be implemented freely. This association deeply feels the pain and cannot remain silent. We earnestly telegraph and request that the leaders review and instruct the Jiangsu Provincial Government to strictly abide by the express orders and quickly abolish the special business tax similar to the likin tax in order to respect the law and relieve the hardships of Jiangsu businesses. We are waiting for orders with the utmost urgency. Ye Huijun, Chairman of the Jiangsu Ninghu City and County Rice Industry Association Federation.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Approval from the Ministry for Anhui Province to Abolish Egg Tax <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Egg Industry Trade Association, previously concerned about the decline in egg exports and the imposition of heavy transit duties (lijin) in Anhui Province, petitioned the Ministry of Finance for relief. The association has now received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, document number Guan Zi 503, which states: "Your petition is noted. Regarding the request to abolish the export egg tax, the repeated petitions from the Shanghai Special Municipality Egg Factory Trade Association's Standing Committee member, Wang Xinqi, have already been submitted to the Ministry and approved on record. As for issuing a general order to all provinces and cities to protect egg merchants, after the transit duty has been abolished, provinces are not allowed to arbitrarily establish new taxes or fees, as has been repeatedly emphasized. Therefore, there is no need to issue another protection order. Regarding the case of Anhui Province's harsh egg tax collection, this Ministry has already instructed the Anhui Finance Department to adhere to the approved business tax rates and to abolish the egg tax bureau. You are hereby notified."</p>

<h3 id="e183">Cotton Association's Petition to Stop Borrowing American Cotton <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Industry Association presented a document to the central government, stating: "Petition Regarding the Nation-Damaging and People-Harming Issue of Borrowing American Cotton – Requesting Your Consideration and Intervention to Prevent This, for the Sake of National Stability and the Benefit of the People." We have read in the Nanjing Political News of the 24th of this month that Rong Zongjing, a prominent Shanghai flour and cotton merchant, recently borrowed 400,000 bales of American cotton at a weekly interest rate of 4%, to be repaid over four years, guaranteed by the government, and that Finance Minister Song is planning to submit this for approval at the Central Political Council meeting. The government authorities reportedly view this matter as having a significant impact on the domestic cotton industry and are mostly in favor of proceeding with caution. Upon reading this, the general sentiment is one of alarm. We believe that under the current circumstances, given the severe decline in our country's agricultural products, there are several reasons why borrowing American cotton is absolutely unacceptable. We respectfully present these to your ministries and departments. Our country is based on agriculture, and agricultural products, particularly silk, tea, cotton, and grain, have traditionally been the most important. Among these, the exports of silk and tea are substantial, generating significant annual revenue. However, due to the influx of foreign goods, the prices of silk and tea have plummeted. This year, there have been particularly large imports of Japanese silk, to the point where Chinese silk has no place to stand, leading to widespread closures. The underlying reason is undoubtedly the pressure from foreign goods. This is the first reason, based on silk and tea, why American cotton should not be borrowed. Our country produces many varieties of cotton, and the yield is considerable. If the harvest is at or above average, the domestically produced cotton should be sufficient to supply the domestic textile industry. In the past, the import of foreign cotton was limited, generally not exceeding 500,000 to 800,000 dan. After last year's floods, the harvest of Chinese cotton decreased, and foreign cotton flowed in continuously. From last autumn to the present, imports have reached 5 million dan, a truly alarming quantity. Furthermore, the existing stock of Chinese cotton in North and South China is still over 1 million dan, and the price per dan is 300-400 liang lower than that of foreign cotton. If we borrow another 1.5 million dan of foreign cotton, how will our existing stock of cotton be sold? This is the second reason, based on the existing stock of cotton, why American cotton should not be borrowed. Cotton farmers in our country account for at least one-tenth of the entire population. These cotton farmers, with their families, rely on the annual income from cotton production for their livelihood. Recently, due to the import of foreign cotton, prices have already fallen by more than 10 liang compared to last year, and even compared to foreign cotton, the price is 300-400 liang lower. If we borrow more foreign cotton, the price of Chinese cotton will fall further, and those who previously relied on it for their livelihood will have no means of survival. Driven by hunger and cold, the old and weak will perish, and the strong will resort to desperate measures. There is no greater hidden danger for the nation. This is the third reason, based on the people's livelihood, why American cotton should not be borrowed. The more foreign cotton is imported, the greater the outflow of cash. In our country, which is currently facing a financial crisis, such a large outflow of cash will deplete our financial lifeblood, leading to imminent collapse. How can social order be maintained? This is the fourth reason, based on social concerns, why American cotton should not be borrowed. Furthermore, the oversupply of American cotton has been widely discussed both domestically and internationally. The American government, in order to maintain the livelihoods of cotton farmers and businesses, is using the surplus cotton to achieve the reputation of lending while enjoying the benefits of increased sales. The merchants borrowing American cotton are considering the interests of American cotton farmers and businesses. Shouldn't they be considering the interests of our country's farmers and businesses? To abandon the root and pursue the branch is the ultimate folly. This is the fifth reason, based on the overall situation, why American cotton should not be borrowed. In conclusion, Chinese cotton is a major agricultural product, and the cotton industry is the source of livelihood for farmers and businesses. It is of utmost importance to both the national economy and the people's livelihood. As an association engaged in the cotton industry, we are familiar with the situation. Therefore, we dare to present this petition to your ministries and departments, hoping that you will consider the people's difficulties, promptly intervene, and firmly reject this proposal in order to strengthen the nation's foundation and benefit the people's livelihood. This is our urgent plea, and we respectfully request your consideration."</p>
<h3 id="e184">Russian Citizen Gletzky's Disappearance Case <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reports that Gletzky, a Russian proofreader at the Shanghai Russian-language newspaper Volimia, was arrested on the night of June 16th for disorderly conduct in the French Concession, along with three other Russian companions. The next day, they were sent to the Second Special District Court on Rue Chévaslier for trial, where Gletzky was sentenced to seven days in prison. On June 23rd, the other three Russians were released and went to Gletzky's residence at 108 Hua Long Road to inform his brother that Gletzky had disappeared. They said they had last seen him around 10 a.m. on the 19th. Two of them even claimed to have seen Gletzky bleeding, apparently from a blow to the chest, allegedly because Gletzky repeatedly asked for water, which angered the prison guards. Another heard Gletzky calling for help, followed by angry voices from the guards. Gletzky then reportedly claimed to be ill and requested to be sent to a hospital for treatment. After that, Gletzky reportedly disappeared. Upon hearing this, Gletzky's brother went to the prison to demand his brother's body, but the prison guards claimed to know nothing. Gletzky's brother then reported the matter to Mr. Meizige, the chairman of the Russian Emigrant Association. Mr. Meizige has sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government authorities inquiring about the matter. Upon hearing the news, the French police have reportedly reported the matter to the French Consulate General and are conducting a thorough investigation. This morning, the French police claimed that if evidence is found, the French Concession authorities plan to protest to the Chinese authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Little Luzon Hat Cleaning Shop Sues for Trademark Infringement <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Sun Pianshi, manager of Little Luzon Hat Cleaning Shop, recently hired lawyers Chen Zhongyin and Ye Fukang to sue Lu Rongde, manager of Meili Na Hat Cleaning Shop on Sima Road, in the First Special District Court for using a similar trademark, requesting the court to stop the infringement. The grounds for the lawsuit are as follows: "Little Luzon" is the popular name for the capital of the Philippine Islands, its English name being Manila. The plaintiff registered the name "Little Luzon" with the National Trademark Bureau of the National Government. The defendant also translated the English name of the capital into Chinese as "Meili Na". According to Article 19 of the Effective Business Practices, in the same city or town, others are not allowed to imitate a registered business name to engage in the same business. Article 20 states that if a registered business name is imitated by others or a similar business name is used for unfair competition, the merchant of the original business name may petition to prohibit its use and request compensation for damages. The defendant's use of the plaintiff's name in the same city or town is obviously illegal, and therefore a lawsuit is filed to stop the infringement. In addition to imitating the plaintiff's business name, the defendant also uses the trademark "Little Luzon Method". After the plaintiff discovered this, they applied to the Trademark Bureau for identification. They have now received identification letter No. 99, which recognizes that there is a suspicion of counterfeiting. "Little Luzon" is the name of the plaintiff's business name and trademark. There is no special hat cleaning method, commercially or chemically, called the "Little Luzon Method". Therefore, it is a deliberate infringement. According to Article 14 of the Trademark Law, the plaintiff is entitled to request a prohibition of its use. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Su opened a court session for questioning. Yuan Yangan and Ma Yizhong, lawyers for Meili Na, argued that the plaintiff only registered the business name "Little Luzon Hat Shop" and cannot claim ownership of the name "Little Luzon" itself. For example, Shen Bao has never sued to prohibit the publication of newspapers such as "Shanghai," "Hu," and "Xin Shen" simply because the newspaper is named after "Shen," a place name. Similarly, regarding Jinling Restaurant versus Nanjing Restaurant, and West Lake Hotel versus Lakeside Hotel, if there is no identical or similar wording on the face of it, how can it be considered infringement? Furthermore, the defendant is also registered and has provided detailed rebuttals regarding trademark matters. The court ordered that the hearing be adjourned to another date.</p>

<p>Farewell to Mrs. Simpson. Yesterday afternoon, starting at 4:00 PM, the Shanghai War Zone Orphanage held recreation and entertainment activities to bid farewell to Mrs. Simpson. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Those present yesterday included Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, General Zhu Ziqiao, Shen Junwen, Xu Rufa, Xu Jigang, Yang Shuping, Sun Fuzhang, Fang Chongde, Qian Zhesheng, Mrs. Bonard, Mrs. Bao Chuanxian, Mrs. Mason, Mrs. He Chenger, Mrs. Byler, Ms. Ma Mulan, Ms. Xu Xiuzhen, Ms. Wu Yuxun, Ms. Hu Zhou Shuan, Ms. Zhou Shujing, Luo Yunyan, Vice President of the Compassionate Infants Association, Wu Weide, Director General, Chen Tiesheng, Deputy Director General, Chen Zhengfan, Zhang Yueru, Xuan Bokun, Ms. Xu Yunru, Mrs. Zhang Xuelou, Director of the Orphanage, staff members Huang Zhenyong, He Yuren, Ms. Zhu Hanwen, Ms. Gong Xiyin, Xu Yong, He Yuren, Ms. Zhu Hanwen, Ms. Gong Xiyin, Ms. Xu Baozhen, and over 100 other people, plus participating children, totaling over 500 people.</p>
<p>Exhibition of Achievements: The War Zone Orphanage has been established for nearly five months. The children in the orphanage attend classes daily, learning Chinese language, arithmetic, music, physical education, games, calligraphy, etc. In their spare time, they learn paper crafts, clay crafts, bamboo crafts, woodworking, and sewing. The operation is quite well-managed. For this recreation and entertainment event, a special room was set aside to display student achievements, which were dazzling and delightful. It is said that the various works were all designed by Ms. Zhu Hanwen, a female teacher at the orphanage.</p>
<p>Inspection of Boy Scouts: At about 4:00 PM, an inspection ceremony of the orphanage's Boy Scout troop was first held on the playground. Under the command of instructor He Yuren, the students performed various activities, which were lively, precise, and very beautiful, showing that their usual training had been effective. Finally, they formed a square formation to listen to Mr. Simpson's address (translated by Wu Weide), the main points of which were: "Seeing you perform so skillfully is truly commendable. I hope you will always maintain the wisdom, benevolence, and courage of the Boy Scout spirit, and become useful talents for the country and society, serving the people of the world." Then, Boy Scout representative He Guibin gave a thank you speech, expressing sincere acceptance.</p>

<p>Entertainment Program: After the Boy Scout inspection, entertainment performances were held, sometimes with double acts, sometimes with pantomime, sometimes with boxing matches, accompanied by music and supplemented by dramas, which were humorous and funny, making people laugh uncontrollably. Various toys were displayed on the stage for the children to play with. The children were focused and excited, and the audience was also very enthusiastic and fascinated.</p>
<p>Farewell Speech: After the entertainment, Chairman Luo Yunyan, on behalf of the orphanage, gave a farewell speech to Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, saying: "In ancient China, Mencius went to see King Hui of Liang. King Hui of Liang asked, 'Old sir, have you come from a thousand miles away to bring some benefit to my country?' Mencius replied, 'Why must the king speak of profit? Let there be benevolence and righteousness.' Now, Sir Simpson has come to China from England to assist the National Government in relieving the flood disaster. When the war broke out in Shanghai, he spoke out righteously, strongly condemning the Japanese military's indiscriminate bombing. Mrs. Simpson is kind and benevolent, sparing no effort in protecting war-zone children. Since the establishment of this orphanage, we have received much assistance from them. It can be seen that Mr. and Mrs. Simpson have come from a thousand miles away, and what they have left for us is only benevolence and righteousness. Today, we bid farewell to Mr. and Mrs. Simpson as they return to their country, and we hope that they will be able to return to this land as soon as possible to benefit this country. We are extremely fortunate."</p>
<p>General Zhu's Remarks: After the chairman's farewell speech, General Zhu Ziqiao stood up and gave a speech, saying: "The longer I interact with Sir Simpson, the more I admire him. This afternoon, two other places invited me to attend meetings, but my coming here to attend this meeting is for unavoidable reasons. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson are doing their best to seek happiness for the Chinese people, making us feel that we met them too late. I hope that Sir Simpson will be able to widely publicize the true situation here to his compatriots and advocate for justice for China overseas."</p>
<p>Simpson's Reply: After Zhu's speech, Mrs. Zhang Xuelou (British), the director of the orphanage, also stood up and gave a speech, expressing her gratitude to Mrs. Simpson. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson then gave a reply, saying: "What we have done in China is only to seek peace of mind. How dare we speak of merit? The more we interact with the Chinese people, the more we feel that the Chinese nation is the most benevolent nation in the world. The friendship they have bestowed upon us is extremely precious and will always be remembered. We also deeply regret that we did not meet them sooner. The happiness of children is the foundation of national happiness. We have recently received 1,400 pounds from friends in England, instructing us to use it to promote the happiness of children. We hope that China's foundation can be consolidated as soon as possible and enter the realm of prosperity and strength. We also hope that the children here today will all strive to make progress, set lofty goals, and become healthy citizens in the future, serving the country and serving humanity."</p>
<p>Student Speech: Finally, Yang Huiming, a student representative from the orphanage, gave a farewell speech to Mrs. Simpson, saying: "We will remember the favors we have received from Mrs. Simpson in our hearts and never forget them. We have lost our parents and families today because of the crimes of Japanese imperialism. We must set our goals to fight for the liberation and freedom of the Chinese nation, and use Mrs. Simpson's great love to help other oppressed small nations." The entire audience applauded continuously. Afterwards, Chinese and foreign photographers came to take pictures, and then the meeting was adjourned. It was already 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Lu Lanchun Sued <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Biological Father Sues Her for Neglecting Support</p>
<p>Lu Countersues, Denying Father-Daughter Relationship</p>
<p>Court Hearing Today Afternoon</p>
<p>Kunqu actress Lu Lanchun, who was once famous in the opera world and highly regarded in the performing arts, disappeared from the stage after marrying Xue YanSheng, the second son of wealthy merchant Xue BaoRong. Recently, her biological father Yu WeiWen (号致案) came from his hometown of Yancheng to Shanghai and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court for abandonment, claiming that when Lu Lanchun was seven years old, after her mother Zhu was divorced, she was sent to a Chen to learn opera. Later, Zhu took her away and she was subjected to abuse by Zhu and her lover Zhang DaMianzi. Zhang even forced her to be a concubine. The plaintiff traveled to Shanghai and Hankou and provided financial assistance to rescue her. Grateful, the defendant acknowledged that she would support the plaintiff for the rest of his life. Now that the defendant has married the wealthy merchant Xue Yansheng and has abundant food and clothing, the plaintiff has repeatedly contacted the defendant through intermediaries to fulfill the promise of support, but the defendant, with a hardened heart, has resolutely refused. According to Article 310 of the Criminal Law, a person who abandons someone with no ability to support themselves, whom they are legally or contractually obligated to assist, nurture, or protect, or who fails to provide necessary assistance, nurture, or protection for their survival, should be held criminally liable. The plaintiff is in his declining years, impoverished and ill, alone and without any support, and his plight is unbearable. Therefore, he has filed a lawsuit according to law, requesting that the defendant be punished accordingly, and incidentally</p>
<p>Requests Reservation of Civil Suit. Upon receiving the complaint, the court immediately issued a summons, notifying the defendant Lu Lanchun to respond according to law. Lu also hired lawyers Wang Fuchang and Wu Linkun to submit a statement to the court, in addition to defending herself and filing a countersuit. Her defense is divided into two points: (1) Procedure: Yu Zhicai once filed a similar lawsuit in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), suing Lu for abandonment, which was dismissed by the court. Now, Yu Zhicai has suddenly become Yu Weiwen, first claiming to be her biological father, and then claiming to be her foster parent, constantly litigating, only hoping to defraud her of money. Based on the principle that a criminal case cannot be tried twice, the lawsuit should be dismissed. (2) Substance: The plaintiff is neither Lu's biological father nor her foster parent, and he has</p>
<p>Sold Lu Repeatedly. The relationship of gratitude and obligation was severed long ago. As early as the 8th year of the Republic of China (1919), the plaintiff had civil lawsuits filed in the Jiangsu Local Court, the Jiangsu High Court, and the Beijing Dali Yuan, all of which resulted in judgments on record. Upon review of the above judgments, not only is there no parental relationship between the defendant and the plaintiff, but she was sold repeatedly, severing all ties of gratitude and obligation long ago. Therefore, there is no obligation to support her, and the crime of abandonment cannot be established. Previously, when Lu was singing opera, her income was substantial. Now that she has married into the Xue family,</p>
<p>He is Driven by Greed. He has been involved in criminal and civil litigation, causing endless entanglement. However, the defendant's loss of reputation and suffering are unspeakable. Therefore, the lawsuit should be dismissed. As for the reasons for the countersuit, they are based on Article 180 of the Criminal Law, which states that anyone who intends to subject another person to criminal or disciplinary punishment and falsely accuses them to the relevant public official shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than seven years, and Article 363, which states that anyone who intends to illegally possess property belonging to themselves or a third party and uses fraudulent means to cause a person to deliver property belonging to themselves or a third party shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years, or detention, and may also be fined or have their fine commuted for an amount not exceeding 1,000 yuan. Yu has no parental relationship with Lu and has repeatedly sold her, and Lu has no obligation to support him. However, he disregards the reputation of others, repeatedly resorts to criminal charges, and publishes them in newspapers, hoping to defraud her of money. Therefore, he is undoubtedly guilty of false accusation and attempted fraud.</p>
<p>A Countersuit is Filed According to Law. Requesting punishment to warn against evil and protect the good. The case was originally scheduled to be heard yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, with Judge Wu Tingqi specially opening a criminal court. Therefore, Yu Weiwen arrived on time and sat in a corner waiting for the hearing. Yu, who is nearly 60 years old, was wearing a blue cloth gown yesterday, looking like someone from the countryside. Lu Lanchun did not appear in court. Judge Wu ascended the bench at 1:30 PM and first heard a theft case, but the hearing did not conclude until 3:30 PM. Realizing that the Lu case could not be heard, he informed the lawyers of both parties to reschedule the hearing for 2:30 PM this afternoon (the 29th). This caused the general public to make a wasted trip. With the hearing being held today, Shanghai residents, impressed by Lu's fame, will likely flock to the court to listen in.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Yesterday Morning's Assassination on Min Guo Road <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Cao Akun Had Enmity with Others</p>
<p>Thugs Broke in and Fired Three Shots</p>
<p>Cao Requested an Emergency Injection</p>
<p>His Wife Arrived Only to Find Him Dead</p>
<p>Cao Akun, a 31-year-old man from Jiangyin living at No. 50 Renji Road, Pudong, used to work as a foreman at the wharves along the Bund in the French Concession. In reality, he specialized in insurance and transporting contraband. He had many followers, which led to him making enemies. Cao often went to the Heliyuan Inn, a three-story building at No. 78 Min Guo Road outside the Xiaodongmen in the French Concession, to play cards in the Ruiji Zhuang room. The Heliyuan Inn was opened by a Ningbo native named Sang Dingsheng, nominally as a cargo storage facility, but in reality, it was a</p>
<p>Disguised Association, exclusively for gatherings and card games among dockworkers. Cao arrived at Ruiji Zhuang in Heliyuan around 5 or 6 PM the day before yesterday and played mahjong with Shen Hongquan, Zhu Ajin, and Wang Wangshi. His enemies found out and sent three thugs in plain clothes armed with weapons to wait outside Heliyuan,</p>
<p>Loitering in the Middle of the Road, waiting to attack Cao when he came out. Cao seemed to have sensed something while playing cards upstairs, so he dared not come downstairs until late at night, continuing to play mahjong until dawn, not ending the game. He intended to leave when the street was bustling with pedestrians, hoping to avoid trouble. Unexpectedly, the thugs waited until 5 AM this morning, and unable to wait any longer, the three rushed up to the third floor, straight to the Ruiji Zhuang room. Seeing Cao still playing cards, two guarded the door while one entered, calling Cao's name directly. When Cao responded, they</p>
<p>Opened Fire with a Handgun, firing three shots in succession. The bullets hit Cao's chest, with two penetrating and one lodged in his back. Cao fell wounded. Seeing their objective achieved, the assailants turned around and fled downstairs in a panic. The three who were playing cards with Cao were all terrified and ran to hide. Later, his companions and his girlfriend, Zhang Axiang, hired a car to take Cao to Renji Hospital for treatment. Upon hearing the news, the Xiaodongmen police immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate the scene, recovering a bullet casing and inquiring about the appearance and clothing of the assailants, reporting back to the head detective for review. When Cao arrived at the hospital, he was still conscious and able to speak. After the doctor applied medicine and bandages, he still felt unbearable pain and requested</p>
<p>An Emergency Injection, wanting to wait for his wife to arrive to meet and talk, and to identify the number and names of the assailants. He also told his girlfriend, Zhang Axiang, that he knew his life was in danger and instructed Zhang to tell his wife to avenge him. At 5:50 AM, his wife, Mrs. Dai, heard the news at home and rushed to the hospital. Cao had already died of his injuries, and the couple did not get to meet. The hospital notified the Xiaodongmen police, who sent detectives to carry the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for an autopsy. At 10 AM, the criminal division of the General Police Department reported to Wu Xiaoke, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, who, accompanied by a forensic doctor, arrived at the location to examine the body. After confirming the identity of the body, he took his seat in court. According to the report of the detective, Cao Dai, the wife of the deceased, claimed,</p>
<p>Her Husband was Tragically Murdered, requesting the arrest of the murderer and seeking justice. The official ordered that it be verified that Cao Akun had indeed died from gunshot wounds before his death. The body was handed over to his wife for funeral arrangements, pending the police's arrest of the murderer for investigation. After the examination, the police took photos of the body and had the family prepare a coffin for burial. Meanwhile, the police found out that the Heliyuan Inn, where the incident occurred, was operating without a license, violating the regulations of the工部局 (Municipal Council), and took the inn owner, Sang Dingsheng, into custody for further investigation. Since the occurrence of this case, the police department has dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to search for the perpetrators, and it is reported that one person has been arrested and taken back to the police station for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Further Trial of a Land Deed Dispute of Several Years <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Redemption Money Paid, Land Deed Not Retrieved</p>
<p>Transfer of Ownership Not Clearly Stated</p>
<p>Supreme Court Deems All Suspicious</p>
<p>High Court Second Branch to Open Trial on the 9th</p>
<p>The financial circle of Shanghai is paying close attention to the land deed dispute between a large bank at No. 198 Dexin Lane, Nanjing Road, and the Spanish Church of Wangde Hall at No. 10 Yangshupu Road. The case has been in litigation for several years and has now been sent back for retrial by the Supreme Court. Initially, in 1927, the large bank received a mortgage on a piece of land located on Avenue Joffre under the name of Zhang Zuyong. At that time, Zhang provided not only the land deed but also various mortgage and sale contracts from owners such as the Oriental Bank. Wangde Hall claimed that these documents were later lost by the Oriental Bank when they were entrusted to transfer the ownership, and they had issued a public statement, etc. In the first trial, the large bank won the case. Wangde Hall appealed to the High Court Second Branch, which ruled that the large bank should return the land deed and other documents to Wangde Hall. The large bank then hired lawyer Ma Junshuo to appeal to the Supreme Court, which resulted in a ruling to send the case back for retrial. The reasons for the ruling were roughly as follows: "The matter that should be investigated in this case is whether the disputed English land deed No. 11199 has been redeemed by Wangde Hall. Reviewing the records, the land deed was mortgaged by Tai Mi Qu Lei Adiesi to Kaden on September 27, 1922, and then transferred by Kaden to the Oriental Bank. The term expired on September 27, 1925, without redemption. According to the agreement, the Oriental Bank mortgaged it to Zhang Zuyong as collateral. Therefore, it is difficult to say that Zhang's acceptance of the mortgage was invalid. Although Wangde Hall claimed to have paid off the mortgage debt for redemption, if it had indeed redeemed the mortgage, it should have retrieved all the mortgage documents as proof of the extinction of the mortgage right. Why allow them to remain in the hands of the large bank, and even not reclaim the land deed? This is even more incomprehensible. If they entrusted the Oriental Bank to transfer the ownership, the Oriental Bank should have indicated 'transfer of ownership on behalf' in the receipt after receiving the land deed. Why is there not a single word? All of these are suspicious. If a detailed investigation is conducted, the truth can be easily obtained. As to whether the large bank has an obligation to return the land deed, it should be determined by whether Wangde Hall can definitively prove that Zhang Zuyong had not mortgaged the land to the Oriental Bank before he redeemed it." The case is now scheduled to open trial on August 9. Liu Hongyuan, the manager of the large bank, has submitted a petition to the High Court Second Branch, stating that in the Shanghai business community, mortgages are the key to financial turnover, and land deed mortgages are especially important. If there is a formal land deed, a proper mortgage document, and a transfer of ownership certificate, the procedure is complete. Therefore, he requests a judgment based on custom.</p>

<p>Fiancé Files a Lawsuit to Confirm the Marriage Contract</p>
<p>Wu Ailin, a 17-year-old dance hall girl at the Xin Xin Dance Hall, had her story of falling into the dance hall previously reported in the newspapers. Her fiancé, Wu Quangen, who works as a boatman, learned that Ailin had been lured to Shanghai by the wife of Chen Jinghua to work as a dance hall girl, so he also tracked her down, wanting to take her home. However, Ailin at this time had completely modernized and refused to acknowledge Quangen as her fiancé. Therefore, Quangen filed a petition with the civil mediation office of the First Special District Court, but mediation was unsuccessful. Now, he has gone a step further and filed a lawsuit against Ailin to confirm the marriage contract, requesting a judgment confirming that the marriage contract between the plaintiff and the defendant is legally established. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang of the First Special Court opened the court to summon them. The plaintiff, Wu Quangen, wearing short coarse clothes and cloth shoes, did not lose his rural character. The defendant, Wu Ailin, wearing a printed silk shirt, silk stockings, and leather shoes, with puffy short hair covering the back of her head, one rural and one fashionable, were worlds apart. A clumsy husband and a beautiful wife facing each other in court attracted even more attention. After Judge Yang took his seat, the plaintiff's lawyer, Fang Jiazhen, stated the case. Wu Quangen then</p>
<p>Detailed the reasons why he married the defendant as a child bride through his parents years ago, and then sent her to his aunt's house for upbringing. Unexpectedly, in May of last year, she was lured to Shanghai by a woman surnamed Chen to work as a dance hall girl. He also claimed that the defendant's real name was Hou Panmei, also known as Gendi. When questioned, Wu Ailin refused to acknowledge that the plaintiff was her fiancé. After debate by the lawyers of both parties, Judge Yang announced that the verdict would be announced at a later date.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhiqing, a Chinese detective of the Central Police Department of the Public Concession, received a tip yesterday morning around 6 AM that robbers were hiding in a hotel on Hankou Road. He immediately went to the address and arrested one person. After strict interrogation, he arrested another person on Rue Robert. He also cooperated with French Concession police to arrest a total of fifteen male and female bandits at three locations, including No. 39 Renji Lane and on Avenue Paul Beau and Rue Bayle. Three handguns and over a hundred bullets were confiscated and taken to the police station for interrogation at the First Special District Court.</p>

<p>Wound Near the Anus</p>
<p>Clearly Moved After Death</p>
<p>At 9:10 PM last night, a female corpse that had been discarded was suddenly discovered near the back door of No. 16, Lane 1, Fukang Lane, Avenue LaFayette, in the French Concession. The deceased was around 20 years old, short in stature, with short, disheveled hair, and a gold tooth in her upper right jaw. She was naked from the waist up, with only a pair of red willow-striped foreign cloth short pants on her lower body, barefoot and without shoes. The body was wrapped in a foreign cloth single mattress and an old mat. When passersby discovered it, they initially suspected it was a beggar curled up there. Upon closer inspection, the head and feet were not visible at both ends of the mat, and they kicked it repeatedly without movement, arousing suspicion. They then notified the lane manager to inspect it together. Upon unfolding the mattress and mat, a naked female corpse was revealed. They immediately reported it to the police, who rushed to investigate. There were no wounds on the body, but upon close inspection, it was clear that the body had been moved there after death. The Tongren Fuyuan branch was notified to dispatch a coffin bearer to carry the body to the autopsy center, pending a report to the Second Special District Court for examination. However, after the body was taken to the autopsy center and examined again, a wound was found near the anus. The police are currently investigating whether she was murdered.</p>

<p>Since the ceasefire, the Seventh District of the Wusong Public Security Bureau has been established for over a month. District Chief Li, fearing that the police officers' marksmanship would deteriorate, has decided to conduct live ammunition drills at Paotaiwan today. Fearing that the people would misunderstand and panic, he has specially announced to all residents of the area to be aware and not to enter the shooting range at that time to avoid danger.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Compilation of Rent Disputes <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Tenants on Dongmen Road: Businesses on Dongmen Road in Nanshi have found that since the reconstruction of the road, rents have increased several times compared to before. Now that the Shanghai Incident has just subsided, the social economy is tight, and the market is sluggish, they are truly unable to bear the burden. They have jointly decided to send a letter to the landlords, requesting a reduction based on the method stipulated by the municipal government in previous years, calculating rent at 8% of the combined land price and construction cost, to provide relief. However, the landlords have not clearly indicated anything. Yesterday, all the tenants on the road jointly signed a petition and publicly appointed Chen Yongnian, Ying Jiuxiang, and Xu Runsheng as representatives to go to the municipal government, the social affairs bureau, and the municipal party headquarters to seek assistance. Chen, the secretary of the municipal government secretariat, Zhang Binghui, the section chief of the fourth section of the social affairs bureau, and Zhu Yangwu of the municipal party headquarters, successively met with them. They found the reasons presented to be quite legitimate and expressed their willingness to accept the case. The representatives were then satisfied and returned. The text of the petition is recorded below for reference. For the matter of petitioning, since the completion of Dongmen Road, its situation has been superior, and its location is important. Shanghai people have called it a model road. However, its commerce has not seen any improvement compared to the former Jishui and Fangbang Roads. After the Shanghai Incident, it has become even more desolate, with some businesses unable to sustain themselves and seeking to close down. There are still several new buildings that have not been rented out. Seeing this situation, the businesses are frightened. Upon investigation, the amount of rent has increased several times compared to before, which is far from the current commercial situation. Reorganizing the road administration is nothing more than creating an opportunity for the landlords. Considering the level of housing rents at home and abroad, it always shifts based on the rise and fall of industry and commerce. There has never been industry and commerce</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Rising without any good reason. If</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Only private interests are considered, industry and commerce will be oppressed.</p>

<p>The hope of prosperity, if not quickly corrected, will</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>, will follow suit and increase rents, which will have a great impact on the city's municipal administration.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Therefore, they have jointly prepared and organized the Dongmen Road Business Tenant Association, wanting to seek prosperity for this road through legal procedures.</p>
<p>Rent is closely related to municipal administration and commerce. Its increase</p>
<p>Must be in line with the times, considering the environment and the economic strength of the citizens, and revised accordingly. At present, although a few landlords are aware and voluntarily reduce rents for free, the majority remain stubborn and ignorant. The fairest method is to follow the former regulations of the city government, calculating rent at 8% of the combined land value and construction cost. The current rent exceeds this standard many times. They have specially prepared a detailed table comparing the land and building prices and rents on this road. After sending the above-mentioned reasons to the landlords, whether they will accommodate them is still unknown. The businesses urgently hope to resolve this issue so that they can live and operate in peace. Furthermore, the former Shanghai South District was affected by the war, and the trade associations discussed and agreed on rent reduction measures and submitted them to the municipal government and the city government for review. However, they have not been promulgated to this day, so the landlords and tenants do not know what to do. Some landlords who do not understand the situation inevitably oppress the tenants in various ways, resulting in frequent disputes and social unrest. Therefore, they have attached a copy of the Dongmen Road Municipal Real Estate Construction Cost Valuation Survey Form and a list of landlord addresses, and dispatched representatives to present everything to the authorities. They respectfully request that they be accepted, and that the landlords be guided to comply with the previous 8% standard set by the city government, implement rent reductions, and that the temporary rent reduction measures for the Shanghai South District be promptly promulgated so that they can be observed and the market can be stabilized. They are anxiously awaiting orders to the highest degree. Respectfully presented, etc.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, After reading the news about the labor unrest in today's newspaper, I found that the note about my conversation with the Dagong News reporter</p>
<p>There are some discrepancies. For example, the phrase "The labor unrest arose</p>
<p>From</p>
<p>Breaking the labor-management contract signed in 1927" was based on the workers'</p>
<p>Announcement. I think the reporter made an omission, so I must clarify. Also, the section about handling</p>
<p>The method, which was the municipal party headquarters and the social affairs bureau discussing</p>
<p>Management principles, is not a separate proposition of this bureau, and there is no order to "send the previous</p>
<p>Conditions to the bureau for review," so I specially ask to correct this in the letter.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Xu Yefu, June 28.</p>

<p>—Mengtiao Master</p>
<p>Not gentle and honest poetry. I know my own faults. Who deliberately makes deceptive words? Praising the besieged city's yuefu lyrics. (Jin Yabao's Yabao's criticisms of the times were sharp, and in his later years, he indulged in sensual pleasures and became increasingly vulgar, not worthy of taking his pepper rain collection's own preface that the language is quick and has lost the ancient people's gentle and honest style. He also regretted it quite a bit. Recently, Chen Yan, Liang Qichao, Hu Shi, and others have praised him highly.)</p>
<p>It is most pitiful to be an old poet. The desolation of the country and family is felt in those years. What world is it now with merchant tones filling the land? Unrolling the scroll, one gazes blankly at Nanshan. (My uncle, grandfather, Weng Wengong's saying "The merchant tones fill the heaven and earth like cicadas and like boiling" is also a line from the poem that my grandmother planted chrysanthemums to mend the fence.)</p>
<p>Han Fu's reputation is known overseas. Late in the year by the Cang River, there is much sorrow. How much is known of Zongchen's lingering regrets? Tears exhaust the satirical poems of Xiangshan. (Zhang Wenxiang)</p>
<p>Wisteria flowers in the capital imprint poetic traces. How many generations of the Zhejiang school of romance remain? The peerless beauty leaves a smile. Autumn waves still captivated when departing. (Li Cunk客)</p>
<p>Poetic quality is as clear as jade, like a person. In dreams, returning to the green palace, one is overwhelmed with emotion. The afterglow of the river tower is clearly present. Listening to the water and listening to the wind, one sends off a lifetime. (Chen Qian'an)</p>
<p>Fan Yi's talent is admired. The difficult passes and mountains oppress the Xian and Tong eras. Who can understand the true man in the heavens? Only the Sea Sun Elder in his life. (Yuan Zhongjie)</p>
<p>The Three Barriers theory is determined in his remaining years. He brings out the only gate of poetry. Who would have expected to add a public case? The dispute over the mound has reached Sanyuan today. (Shen Yi'an Yi'an used to discuss with Shi Yi about the theory of Sanyuan. In his later years, he easily changed to Sanguan. Recently, Shi Yi's disciples wrote a preface to Shi Yi's chronicle, insisting on attributing the theory of Sanyuan to Shi Yi, which is ridiculous.)</p>
<p>The young master is romantic, Hou Xueyuan. The heart of the remnant people is like Du Chacun. Unable to stand by and watch the events of China, he rises the national soul in the poems. (Chen Boyan)</p>

<h3 id="e211">Homemade Small Desk Lamp <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>The desk lamps sold in the market are mostly large, and the electricity they consume is also quite considerable. We find them somewhat uneconomical. Now there's a method to make a small desk lamp yourself. Not only does it save electricity, but it's also very interesting. Its brightness is sufficient for desk use. Readers may want to try it. The method is as follows: (Materials) A square transformer (commonly used for doorbells, which can convert ordinary voltage into 3-1/2 volts), one</p>
<p>A small light bulb (around 6V, commonly known as a car bulb), one</p>
<p>A small lamp holder (for inserting the small light bulb), one. Insulated wire (length determined by the distance from the power source), one length</p>
<p>Cloth-covered wire (about 2 feet of size 20), one length. A cigar box made of wood (approximately 5 inches in length, width, and height), one</p>
<p>A small wooden board (approximately 4 and 6/7 inches square), one piece. Male and female plugs, two each</p>
<p>(Of the above items, apart from the wooden box and board, the rest are sold in large electrical supply stores. Sometimes they are also sold at used goods stalls, and the prices are much cheaper than new ones, but broken ones are unusable.)</p>
<p>(Assembly) Connect both ends of one end of the insulated wire to both ends of one end of the transformer. Connect two pieces of cloth-covered wire to both ends of the other end of the transformer. Then nail the transformer onto the board, put it in the box, and nail it down. Make a hole in the side of the box for the insulated wire to pass through. Make two more holes on the other side, each with a female plug installed. Connect the two ends of the two cloth-covered wires from one end of the transformer to these two female plugs. Then take two more cloth-covered wires, connect one end to the lamp holder, and the other end to the male plugs. Then install the light bulb into the lamp holder. Once this is assembled, connect the other end of the insulated wire to a power source (i.e., ordinary AC power, about 200V). When in use, plug the male and female plugs together, and the light will turn on! However, one thing to note is whether the voltage output from the transformer matches the voltage required by the light bulb. If it's too low, the light won't turn on. If it's too high, it will easily burn out the filament. To avoid this issue, it's best to buy a rheostat and install it in between. Connect one end of the rheostat to one end of the transformer, and the other end to one of the female plugs. When in use, simply slowly turn the rheostat, and the light will gradually brighten. However, don't turn it too far, just until it's bright enough, otherwise, you will burn out the filament. Turning it backward will gradually dim it. Turning it all the way to the end will turn it off. It's like a kerosene lamp, where you can freely adjust the brightness and turn it off, and the filament is not easily burned out, making it much more interesting than a large desk lamp!</p>
<p>The above are the main principles of installation and connection. As for the exterior decoration, readers can think for themselves. You can decorate it however you like as long as you follow these principles!</p>

<h3 id="e212">Old Li's Diary <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Fojin</p>
<p>Today in English class, the bell had rung a long time ago, but our female teacher still hadn't arrived, and the students were getting a little impatient.</p>
<p>"Old Li," classmate Zhou covered his mouth with his hand, leaned close to my ear, and said in a very small voice, "I'm afraid Ms. Huang has her 'monthly red' again, otherwise why isn't she here yet?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, maybe she has something else," I said with a smile.</p>
<p>Indeed, our female English teacher really gives the students too much to talk about. If she takes leave for an hour or is late by five or six minutes, the naughty students take the opportunity to say inappropriate things. Some say rude things like classmate Zhou, while others say she went to find a lover. One person says one thing, another says another, gossiping and saying the most awful things. The male students burst out laughing when they hear it, while the female students blush. But these naughty students say whatever comes to mind, and you really can't stop them.</p>
<p>However, Ms. Huang really does give the students something to talk about. Although she is in her thirties, her face is still painted red, and she changes her cheongsam every time she comes. According to my calculations, she has taught for four weeks, three hours each week, and she has changed twelve cheongsams in total. It's like a bride changing wedding dresses, truly "old in years but young at heart."</p>
<p>However, Ms. Huang teaches English very well, explaining each word and sentence clearly, and her pronunciation is also very accurate. Because of this, many students are very eager to attend her class, and very few are absent without reason. Even students from other classes come to freeload and join in the fun. This is a problem because after the "January 28th Incident," when the Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai broke out, most of the university campuses were turned into ashes by Japanese imperialism. Therefore, this semester, all the universities tucked their tails between their legs and ran to the concession to rent foreign houses to start school. The foreign houses rented by C University, although there are more than a dozen classrooms, are narrow and small, so the students have to fight for chairs when class starts and ends, like refugees抢米 (抢米 means to grab rice), the weaker female students are squeezed into the corners by the male students, and they can only watch helplessly. Therefore, the female students come very early to English class, especially today, because when the previous class ended, Ms. Huang told us that she would be asking questions today. Not only did the female students come very early, but the male students also came very early.</p>
<p>The students were still sitting and waiting. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour passed, and Ms. Huang still hadn't arrived.</p>
<p>"Old Li, isn't it: I guessed right with just one sentence." When the students dispersed and walked out of the classroom door, classmate Zhou patted me on the shoulder and asked me in a very funny tone.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, maybe she has something else," I still said.</p>

<p>— Wenbai</p>
<p>The poorer the society, the more fraudulent and deceitful activities there are. This is a natural and immutable causal relationship. Unfortunately, being born in China today as a commoner with no livelihood security means you often face the danger of unemployment. Once unemployed, there is no food to eat, no clothes to wear, and no house to live in. So, the more honest ones beg, and the more mischievous ones become thieves. Aren't we already tired of seeing theft cases in the daily newspapers? And those kinds of fraudulent things, the big ones are also seen in the daily newspapers, and the smaller ones, as long as you often stroll around the crossroads, you can't avoid encountering them repeatedly. Like selling fake rings, fake jewelry: etc., are things that everyone already knows, but the trick of the woman I saw that day was new ｜｜ at least it was the first time I discovered it.</p>
<p>The matter is like this: that day, I went to get a haircut with a friend, and when we passed by Stealing Chicken Bridge, a woman wearing a willow branch short shirt suddenly came to ask for directions:</p>
<p>"Excuse me, sir! How do I get to Gaochang Temple from here?" she said.</p>
<p>"From here, take the Route 5 tram to Ximen; at Ximen, transfer to another tram and you can go directly to Gaochang Temple," my friend told her.</p>
<p>"No, I'm asking how to walk there?"</p>
<p>"Walk there? There are many ways to go. You should take the tram!" my friend said, seeing that she was not a very healthy woman.</p>
<p>"But sir, I don't have a single copper coin on me. How can I take the tram! Can you do a good deed, sir, and give me two dimes? I would be grateful to you even in death!" She suddenly revealed a look of sorrow, and tears seemed about to fall.</p>
<p>Seeing this, you really couldn't bear it, so my compassionate friend generously gave her two dimes. After thanking us repeatedly, we went our own way.</p>
<p>Not long after, when we came back from the haircut and passed by the original place, we saw that the woman wearing the willow branch short shirt was still at the entrance of the mosque on Stealing Chicken Bridge, and there was a merchant-like man giving her money. When we saw this, we knew she was a swindler, and we immediately wanted to confront her, but when she saw us, she fled in a puff of smoke. What could we do?</p>

<h3 id="e214">Maidens and Toys <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Songlu</p>
<p>According to a report from the Electric Communication Society, there is a record as follows:</p>
<p>"The delegation of maidens from Manchukuo, Lei Jingshu, Yang Yun, Tsuda Sumiko, Toizumi Yukiko, Kim Kunwon, etc., arrived in Tokyo at 8 PM last night. This morning, they went to Nijubashi Bridge to pay their respects remotely to the Imperial Palace, and then visited Meiji Jingu Shrine and Yasukuni Shrine. At 11 AM, they met Mayor Taida and delivered the official documents of Manchukuo. At 1 PM, they attended a welcome meeting held by Tokyo City at Hibiya Hall, where Tokyo City presented them with dolls as toys."</p>
<p>"Women are toys?" This saying has long been scorned by the ladies and gentlemen of our Republic of China, and they have obtained equal rights for men and women from the government. Unexpectedly, these maidens from Manchukuo are actually willing to lower themselves and beg for pity from Japanese imperialists, to pay their respects remotely to the Imperial Palace, and to accept the toys given by Tokyo City. This puppet comedy, which is both comical and heartbreaking, is so sad, shameful, lamentable, and laughable!</p>
<p>Originally, the so-called government of Manchukuo was a puppet organization under Japanese violence, and these maiden envoys are puppets under puppets! The so-called rulers of Manchukuo are originally toys in the hands of the Japanese, and this group of maiden envoys are merely toys of the toy players, offering gifts indirectly and then directly. This magic lantern-style old trick has long been exposed by countries all over the world. We are just pitiful children, knowing that we have been coerced and deceived by the performers, but we dare not utter a word to them.</p>
<p>Some say: How can these maiden envoys willingly act as playthings? They are just like the children hired by Shandong street performers, forced to do so by violence! I say: Poor them! Poor these maidens, not only have their bodies been raped by the Japanese, but their pure hearts have also been raped by the Japanese! Besides pitying them, we can only blame our family head for being weak, so that our wives and daughters are offered for the trampling of foreign races! Alas! How painful!</p>
