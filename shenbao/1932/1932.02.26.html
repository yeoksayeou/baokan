<p>時評</p>
<h3>收回失地與討伐僞國彬</h3>
<p>東北淪亡已經將近半年了。它是淪亡在日本軍閥的手裏而且直至現在還是在日本軍閥鐵路之下被踐踏着。所以我們的目標。應該是「收回失地。」　　或者有人認爲東北現在已將建立新政權。正式建立所謂「大同國。」而這僞國的籌備者。正是熙洽傅儀等及一班漢奸。所以我們應該明令討伐。我們的目標。應該是「討伐僞國。」</p>
<p>我們認爲這兩件事。很容易矇蔽一般人的耳目。轉移一般人的目標。因爲「收回失地」的目標是對外。而「討伐僞國」却是對內。我們最大的敵人。是日本的軍閥「收回失地。」便是動員我國人一致對日的一個正確的目標。　　去年九一八日本軍閥實力攻取我東北。這事我們還記得。日軍刧持溥儀赴瀋陽。這事我們也還記得。所謂「新政權」「新國家」等名詞。都是從日本軍閥的口裏喊出來的。國聯日本代表佐藤在二月十九日國聯行政會議席上。曾公然聲言。「日本對於東三省獨立運動。頗表同情。」在日軍滿佈東北的情勢之下。東北却有所謂建立新國家獨立政權的醞酿。很顯然的這幕滑稽劇主演。者是日本的軍閥。正是甲午戰後日本由承認韓國獨立進而滅韓的手段。復演一次</p>
<p>熙洽與溥儀及一羣漢奸算什麽。他們不過是一羣被人玩弄的木偶。被人驅使的工具。他們在日本軍閥的利誘與威脅之下只有服從。没有自已的意志。正如行獵一樣。他們只是被豢養的鷹犬。而日本的軍閥。却是發縱指示的獵。人我們與其討伐漢奸。毌寗打倒漢奸所賴以生存的日本的軍。閥所以我們的目標。應該是「收回失地。」</p>
<p>東北淪亡已經將近半年了。我們忍令白山黑水長此變易顔色　如其不然則目前已經到了全國動員「收回失地」的時候了。</p>

<h3>美國遠東政策</h3>
<p>在史汀生函中宣布</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務卿史汀生函政參議員波拉擁　在華門戶開放政策言及其一月一日關於遠東時局之牒文略謂世界他國</p>
<p>政府如採行與此同樣之地位則可對於破壞公約之行爲予以警告而使此後欲以破壞和平的壓力而維持之任何名義或權利不能合法有效云史汀生未責備中國或日本但謂九國公約乃互有關聯互相維繫的數種公約之美國前所之願放棄造艦運動中之控制地位而不增加甘姆島與斐列濱羣島之防禦工程者因賴九國公約有自制條文也此約擔保各國有在東方貿易之均等機會不受任何國家不利於中國之軍事侵略云官塲謂美國對於遠東之態度可於史汀生致波拉函中所稱「吾人堅力擁護門戶開放原則與九國公約」一語見之史汀生並稱九國公約之締結也中國時方發展其自由制度而各簽約國亦願抛棄可干涉中國之任何侵略政策云紐約晚郵報評論史汀生此函稱爲「最近十年中美國政策之最重要的宣佈」並謂華盛頓會議所發動之全部政策聽令日本在其世界一部份中享有海上覇權者將視中日問題之有無可接受的解决爲轉移如日本妄用其地位則美國或將抛棄其政策而造成在太平洋中有根據地之海軍以阻止日本支配中國及中國所有之偉大商塲云今日參議院海軍委員會對於就倫敦海軍條約所許範圍積極造成艦隊之案已予以美滿之審查報告覯此則國會在此時局中對於海軍方面之反響已可由此見之（二十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）史汀生致波拉之函切實聲明九國公約之「自制的條件」中有美國放棄其建造戰艦之領袖地位並約　美國不再增加甘姆島與斐列濱之防禦工程今欲修正約文而不注意此種允諾實不可能（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本輿情對於史汀生致波拉之函認爲一重在錯誤足興無量之害而無裨益日人曾否認違背九國公約故以爲此函不特將激起全國之憤慨且將堅固上海華軍之抵抗力而增日軍擊退十九路軍以安定大局之困難（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>紐約共和黨與民主黨各報評論國務卿史汀生致波拉之函稱爲美國遠東政策偉大这宣言講壇導報謂史汀生之宣言可爲對芳澤脆弱諍議之痛快的反駁並光明無落表示如何及曷爲保障中國免受侵略之條約一旦失其效力將即擾害一九二一至二二年所訂各種條約成立之太平洋均勢（二十五日路透社電）</p>

<h3>Recovering Lost Territory and Punishing the Puppet Regime of Manchukuo</h3>
<p>The Northeast has been lost for nearly half a year. It was lost to the Japanese militarists, and even now, it is still being trampled under the iron heel of the Japanese militarists. Therefore, our goal should be "Recovering Lost Territory." Some people may think that the Northeast has now established a new regime, formally establishing the so-called "Great Harmony State." And the preparers of this puppet state are precisely Xi Qia, Pu Yi, and other traitors. Therefore, we should issue a clear order to punish them. Our goal should be "Punishing the Puppet Regime."</p>
<p>We believe that these two things can easily deceive the public and divert their attention. Because the goal of "Recovering Lost Territory" is external, while "Punishing the Puppet Regime" is internal. Our greatest enemy is the Japanese militarists. "Recovering Lost Territory" is a correct goal to mobilize all our people to unite against Japan. We still remember the incident last year on September 18th when the Japanese militarists forcibly seized our Northeast. We also still remember that the Japanese army kidnapped Puyi to Shenyang. The so-called "new regime," "new country," and other terms all came from the mouths of the Japanese militarists. At the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on February 19th, the Japanese representative Sato openly stated, "Japan expresses considerable sympathy for the independence movement in the three eastern provinces." Under the circumstances of the Japanese army being all over the Northeast, the so-called brewing of establishing a new country and an independent regime in the Northeast is obviously a farce directed by the Japanese militarists. It is a re-enactment of the means by which Japan recognized Korea's independence and then destroyed Korea after the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>What are Xi Qia, Puyi, and a group of traitors? They are nothing more than a group of puppets being played with, tools being driven. Under the enticements and threats of the Japanese militarists, they can only obey and have no will of their own. Just like hunting, they are just hawks and hounds being raised. And the Japanese militarists are the hunters who give the instructions. Instead of punishing the traitors, wouldn't it be better to defeat the Japanese militarists on whom the traitors depend for their survival? Therefore, our goal should be "Recovering Lost Territory."</p>
<p>The Northeast has been lost for nearly half a year. Can we bear to let the white mountains and black waters change color for a long time? If not, then now is the time for national mobilization to "Recover Lost Territory."</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Full-Scale Bloody Battle: Our Army Victorious</h3>
<p>Over 1,700 Enemy Soldiers Killed at Xiaochangmiao</p>
<p>Enemy Troops at Jiangwan Collapsed by Our Flanking Attack</p>
<p>Our Army's Positions at Miaohang and Zhabei Solid</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting at Wusong: Shell Hits Enemy Headquarters</p>
<h3>Latest News This Morning</h3>
<p>Our Army Slightly Retreated on the Side of Miaohang Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Counterattack in the Afternoon and Progress in the Evening</p>
<p>Our Army Lured the Enemy to Xiaochangmiao and Surrounded Them</p>
<p>Over 1,700 Enemy Soldiers Killed</p>
<p>News at 1:00 AM This Morning: Starting from yesterday morning, the enemy used over a hundred artillery pieces to fiercely suppress our army's positions along the entire line from Jiangwan to Miaohang. On the Jiangwan front, our army resolutely defended its lines without moving. On the side of Miaohang, because the enemy had a total of fifty or sixty artillery pieces concentrating their firepower, our army slightly retreated to Shuichetou around 9:00 AM, but Miaohang was still firmly defended by our army. Around 12:00 PM, our reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce counterattack, thus driving back the enemy and regaining the original positions in the afternoon. Around 9:00 PM in the evening, our army's attack became even stronger, and the enemy was unable to resist and retreated. Our army's front line advanced to Xiaochangmiao. At the same time, our army also made new progress in the Jiangwan area. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in this battle, and our side also suffered losses.</p>
<p>News at 2:00 AM This Morning: After the Japanese reinforcements arrived yesterday afternoon, they all joined the front line in the Jiangwan area to fight. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, the enemy launched a fierce offensive towards Jiangwan, Miaohang, and other places, using dozens of tanks to cover their charge and heavy artillery to bombard our positions. Our army waited for them to rush close and then engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Before long, our army feigned defeat and lured the enemy to Xiaochangmiao, between Jiangwanzhen and Miaohangzhen. Our army then adopted a large encirclement formation. The enemy charged more than ten times but ultimately failed. By 10:00 PM last night, over 1,700 enemy soldiers had been killed, and countless weapons and other spoils of war had been seized. A small number of enemies broke through the encirclement and fled. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue them. The front-line positions have not changed.</p>
<h3>Situation on the Miaohang Front</h3>
<p>Although the Enemy's Artillery is Fierce, Our Army Firmly Defends its Positions</p>
<p>Fighting is Fierce on Both Sides; Fire Breaks Out in Miaohang</p>
<p>The enemy army launched a fierce attack on our entire line. Since the 20th, it has lasted for four days and nights. It is even more intense in the Miaohang area. Our side firmly defends its position, and the enemy cannot succeed. Starting from around midnight yesterday morning, they used extremely fierce heavy artillery to bombard us. After dawn, eight or nine planes bombed our lines in the air. The area between Houjia Muqiao and Jinmuzha is the most critical. In the afternoon, the enemy's artillery fire was dense, and shells rained down. In order to concentrate our main force, our side slightly shortened the line of defense and also used heavy artillery to return fire. In the afternoon, the enemy gradually became unable to support themselves and moved backwards. Our side still firmly defended the original line of defense.</p>
<p>The Remaining Enemy in Jinmuzha is Eliminated; Surrounded in Miaohangzhen</p>
<p>The remaining enemy in Jinmuzha was ambushed by our army on both sides after 12:00 PM the day before yesterday, killing over 200 of the surrounded 400-plus people on the spot and seizing over 200 rifles. The remaining enemy fled wounded. Later, the enemy received reinforcements after 2:00 AM yesterday morning, gathering the remaining enemy of about 3,000-plus people and launching another fierce counterattack, attempting to break through our army's positions near Wujiazhai, northeast of Jiangwanzhen, using their heavy artillery cover. Our army bravely resisted and engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat. The situation was intense. During the fierce battle, nine enemy planes simultaneously flew out to assist in the battle, throwing bombs downwards. However, because the enemy army had suffered repeated defeats, they had lost their fighting spirit, while our army advanced wave upon wave, fighting more and more bravely, and obtained news that troops were taking a shortcut to copy their rear and prepare to cut off their retreat. Thus, the enemy army felt increasingly unable to support themselves and retreated one after another. Our army pursued them, and many enemies trampled on each other. The enemy suffered more than half the casualties in this battle and were extremely embarrassed. It took about ten hours before they could catch their breath, but the enemy regrouped again after 11:00 AM at noon and charged towards our army's position. At that time, many enemy soldiers were already fearful and unwilling to advance. Our army fought with them for about an hour and then retreated in defeat. In the afternoon, the enemy still attacked from time to time, but it was not as fierce as before.</p>
<p>The Enemy Attacks Miaohang in Three Teams; The Enemy Army Continued the Previous Night's Battle, Attacking the Northeastern Part of Miaohangzhen, Starting at Dawn Yesterday Morning, and Using More Than a Dozen Planes and Many Artillery Pieces to Assist in the Battle, Dividing More Than 4,000 Infantry Soldiers into a Large Left, Center, and Right Unit. The Left Team Was Stationed in the Taojiawan Area, the Right Team Was Between Houjia Muqiao and Jinmuzha, Advancing Toward Jinmuzha, and the Center Team Was Between the Taojiawan and the Right-Center Teams, Attacking Mengjiazhai Fiercely. Our Army Stationed a Large Force in Front of Jinmuzha and Mengjiazhai to Meet the Enemy and Used Artillery to Bomb the Enemy Fiercely. The Artillery Fire of Both Sides Was Extremely Fierce. The Two Armies Engaged in Combat Between the Artillery Shells. After Several Hours of Hand-to-Hand Combat, the Enemy Army Gradually Became Unable to Support Itself. At About 11:00 AM, Our Army Continued to Work Hard and Vowed to Resist to the Death. The Enemy's Casualties Reached Hundreds of People. Our Casualties Were Not Even Half of the Enemy's. At Noon, the Enemy's Right-Wing Unit Slightly Slanted Southward, Intending to Connect with the Center Route Team, but Was Separated by Our Army's Fierce Artillery Fire. The Enemy Began to Retreat in Defeat in the Afternoon. Our Army Still Defended the Original Defense.</p>
<p>A Great Fire Broke Out in Miaohangzhen Yesterday Morning; The Fierceness of the Resistance of Our Army and the Enemy Army in the Miaohangzhen Area Was the Only One in Recent Days. The Enemy Used Planes to Assist in the Abuse, Throwing Bombs Everywhere. At 7:00 AM Yesterday Morning, Enemy Planes Flew to Miaohangzhen, Three Rows of Nine, and Threw Bombs at Our Army's First Line of Defense. Our Army Fired at Them with Anti-Aircraft Guns, Almost Hitting Them, and Then Threw Several Sulfur Bombs Behind Our Army, Causing Disasters to Civilian Houses and Thatched Huts. The Burning Was So Intense That the Fire Was Bright, and the Smoke Reached Miles Away. From 7:00 AM to 1:00 PM Yesterday Morning, the Ashes Floated Between Dachang and Pengpu and Had Not Stopped. Because the Place Where the Fire Started Was Close to the Front Line, It Was Impossible to Rescue It. The Magnitude of the Loss Caused by the Destruction of the Enemy Planes Can Be Imagined. It Is Truly Heartbreaking.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Military Affairs Announced the Battle Report; Reuters Nanjing Telegram, 25th: The Ministry of Military Affairs' Communiqué Declared That This Morning, Our Army in Miaohangzhen Slightly Retreated Due to the Enemy Army's Fierce Offensive. In the Afternoon, a Counterattack Was Launched and the Enemy Army Was Driven Back. It Was Heard That After Hours of Fierce Fighting, the Chinese Army Had Recovered the Lost Ground.</p>
<p>Wounded Soldiers Describe the Reality of the Battle; Yesterday, a soldier named Pei Shengjun, a member of the local militia who fought on the front line of Miaohang, sent a letter to this newspaper from the wounded soldier hospital describing the situation of the battle on the 22nd and 23rd. Apart from slightly correcting and polishing the wrong words and sentences, the rest remained the same. He said that the main force of the enemy army was about 100 meters away directly in front of the area defended by my unit the day before yesterday (22nd), attempting to capture our Miaohangzhen with a strong position. At that time, the enemy side used heavy artillery to cover and planes to bomb. The sound of artillery was rumbling and the sound of the planes was rattling. Those who had not gone to the front line were shaken by the sound. Our soldiers are duty-bound to defend the country, but the thought of the lives and property of civilians being lost for no reason makes our hearts ache. The officers and soldiers of the local militia of my unit defended stubbornly and fought hard for about several hours, determined to annihilate the enemy, and everyone was determined to die. Later, troops from the local army arrived to reinforce us. At this time, the enemy's artillery fire had gradually thinned out. That night, the drizzle was hazy and the cold wind was blowing. The enemy side was silent, as if resting and waiting for the intention of launching a counterattack at dawn. The troops that had arrived immediately seized this opportunity to prepare thoroughly. As a result, each battalion of the local militia was ordered to send a company of soldiers to encircle and attack them. The enemy was caught in our plan and retreated several miles, not only restoring the original defense area of my unit but also advancing several meters. The number of enemy soldiers wounded or killed was countless. We obtained more than a hundred pieces of spoils of war. The number of dead and wounded on our side was only ten-odd people. Yesterday morning (23rd), the enemy launched another counterattack, but the Japanese soldiers were too scared to move forward because they had been hit too hard. In short, this group of young masters was in a very embarrassing state. At this time, I was injured, and I was no longer aware of the situation after that.</p>
<h3>Situation on the Jiangwan Front</h3>
<p>The Enemy Army Secretly Attacked in Two Ways</p>
<p>Our Side Sent Out Surprise Troops for a Flanking Attack</p>
<p>As a Result, the Entire Enemy Army Collapsed</p>
<p>Our Army's Front Line Greatly Advanced</p>
<p>The Situation in Jiangwan Yesterday Morning Was All in Artillery Battles. Japanese Planes Dropped Bombs in the Air, and There Were Occasional Rifle Sounds, but It Was Only Contact Between Sentries. Around 6:00 PM in the Afternoon, Japanese Soldiers Protruded from the Sports Association Road and Tianle Temple, Advancing to Attack. Our Army Rose Up to Meet the Attack. Around 7:00 PM in the Evening, the Enemy Army Was Unable to Support Itself and Retreating One After Another. Our Army Took Advantage of the Victory to Pursue Them. Gunfire and Cannon Sounds Were Heard in the Yangshupu Area. Our Army's Front Line Had Advanced Forward and Was Still Advancing at the Time of Writing. The Details Are Recorded Below: Around 6:00 PM Yesterday Afternoon, After the Japanese Army Dropped Bombs from Planes, They Took Advantage of the Artillery Cover to Send Two Routes of Heavy Troops, About 1,000 People, to Advance and Reconnoiter Our Army's Defensive Lines. One Was from the Sports Association Road, and One Was Along the Tianle Temple, Rushing Towards Jiangwan and Using Tanks as Guides. Our Army Immediately Launched Fierce Attacks in Two Ways. In Addition to Bombing with Hand Grenades, Our Army Had a Big Knife Team in Front to Break Through the Formation. Most of the Enemy Soldiers Were Annihilated and Were Unable to Support Themselves and Retreat. Before Long, the Enemy Army's Reinforcements Charged Again and Again. Shells Were as Dense as Raindrops. Our Army Artillery Team Also Returned Fire to the Enemy's Formation, Bombing the Railway and the Area Around It. A Few Shells Also Hit Jiangwanzhen. After Many Hours of Fierce Fighting, the Enemy Army Could Not Succeed. Around 7:00 PM, the Enemy Soldiers Became More and More Numerous, and Our Army Sent Out Surprise Troops to Flank the Enemy on the Sports Association Road. The Enemy Army's Lines Were Shaken, and the Enemy at the Tianle Temple Also Seemed Unable to Support Itself. Before Long, They Were Completely Defeated by Our Army. Our Army on the Sports Association Road Had Approached the Racecourse, and the Enemy Army Also Made Progress in the Tianle Temple Area. Seeing That the Line Was Critical, the Enemy Army Urgently Used Artillery to Bomb It. Our Army's Artillery Position Was Also Moved Forward to Return the Fire. Until 10:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Situation on the Zhabei Front</h3>
<p>The Enemy Army's Artillery Attacks Were Violent</p>
<p>All Were Repelled by Our Army</p>
<p>Starting from 2:00 PM Yesterday Afternoon, the Japanese Army on the Zhabei Front Continued to Use Artillery to Bomb Our Army's Various Lines. Our Army Also Returned Fire with Artillery. Most of the Japanese Army's Shells Fell on Zhongxing Road, Yongxing Road, Gonghe Xin Road, Datong Road, and Other Places Without Major Losses. One Shell Fell into a Thatched House Between Huta Road and Pushan Road, Killing Two Coolies and Wounding One Woman and One Child. Japanese Planes Dropped Bombs in Zhabei Around 12:00 PM, Causing a Fire in the 民房 Near Baoxing Road. Our Army Used Anti-Aircraft Guns to Aim and Shoot and Hit an Enemy Plane. The Japanese Army Still Occasionally Shot at Tiantong'an Road, Baziqiao, and Jiangwan Road. A Fierce Battle Suddenly Broke Out at 6:00 PM. Our Army Also Pressed Towards Hongzhen. The Artillery Fire of Both Sides Did Not Cease All Day. The Various Situations Are Recorded Separately Below.</p>
<h3>The Fierce Battle at Baziqiao The Japanese Army at Baziqiao Still Used Rifles to Shoot at Our Army's Defensive Line from Time to Time After Failing to Attack in the Morning. Our Army Laid in Ambush in the Trenches Without Making a Sound. Although the Japanese Army's Artillery Team Used Artillery to Bombard Them, It Did Not Damage Our Army's Line at All. Most of the Enemy's Shells Hit Nearby 民房. Our Army Returned Fire Accordingly. Around 6:00 PM in the Afternoon, More Than 500 Enemy Soldiers Again Attacked Our Army in That Area Under the Dark Dusk. The Momentum Was Quite Fierce. Our Army Rose Up to Resist. Although the Enemy's Shells Were as Dense as Rain, They Were Not Afraid at All. The Machine Guns and Mortars of Both Sides Did Not Cease for Half an Hour. They Stopped and Started Again, Which Shows the Fierceness of the Charge and Hand-to-Hand Combat at That Time. Our Army Also Used Hand Grenades Well, So There Were Many Casualties Among the Enemy Soldiers. Around 7:00 PM, the Enemy Army Gradually Felt Unable to Support Itself and Retreat Towards Diswei Road After Repeated Attacks Failed and Casualties Followed. Our Army Took Advantage of the Situation to Force Them to Retreat Until Around 9:00 PM. Gunfire Could Be Heard Very Clearly in the Hongzhen Area. At the Time of Writing, It Had Not Stopped. It Is Thought That Our Army Was Still Pursuing Them. At the Same Time, More Than a Dozen Trucks Carrying Wounded Enemy Soldiers in Yangshupu Were Transporting From East to West.</h3>
<h3>Defeating the Enemy on Tiantong'an Road After the Enemy Attacked Baziqiao, More Than 700 Enemy Soldiers Again Attacked Our Tiantong'an Road Around 7:00 PM in the Afternoon. They Took Artillery and Armored Vehicles as Cover to Charge. Machine Guns Fired at Our Army Intermittently. Our Army Calmed Down and Did Not Respond. We Waited for the Enemy to Charge Closer Before Our Army's Machine Guns and Rifles on Both Sides Fired at the Same Time. The Pioneer Enemy Soldiers Fell Down in Response. The Enemy's Armored Vehicle Rose Up to Charge. Our Army Used Hand Grenades and Mortars to Bomb Them. They Were So Dense That They Were Like Rain. The Enemy Vehicle Rapidly Retreat. Seeing the Opportunity, Our Army Charged Out Together. The Enemy Army Could Not Support Itself and Re-banded, Fighting and Retreating. Our Army Still Firmly Defended the Original Defensive Line. The Enemy's Artillery Team's Artillery Suddenly Became Dense Again. Our Army Continued to Return Fire Until Around 11:00 PM. The Gunfire Turned Sparse and Went Back Into Artillery Battles.</h3>
<h3>Small Contact on Qiujiang Road Qiujiang Road is Connected to Sichuan Road, So the Japanese Army Disturbed That Place From Time to Time With a Small Number of Soldiers. But Once Our Army Retaliated, They All Retreated. Around 6:00 PM Last Night, the Japanese Army Used the Same Trick Again. After About 20-Plus Minutes of Battle, the Enemy Was Unable to Support Itself and Collapsed in Defeat. This is Where the Sound of Machine Guns and Rifles That Were Heard on the Zhabei Front Last Night Came From.</h3>
<h3>Damaging Japanese Planes on Baoxing Road At 12:15 PM Yesterday Noon, Three Japanese Planes Flew to the Sky Over the Baoxing Road Area in Zhabei, Inspecting Our Army's Position in That Area and Dropping 12 Huge Bombs One After Another. Two Bombs Exploded Immediately, Causing Another Big Fire in the Nearby 民房, Which Spread to 1:45 PM in the Afternoon Before It Was Extinguished. Our Defensive Line Was Not Damaged at All. The Troops Stationed There Immediately Aimed the Anti-Aircraft Guns at the Largest of the Two Planes and Fired. The Shell Hit the Left Wing of the Plane. It Somersaulted in the Air and Fell to the Ground. When the Plane Was About 200 Feet Above the Ground, the Body of the Plane Suddenly Rotated to the Left and Flew Upward Again. At That Time, Two Japanese Planes That Were Not Damaged Were Still Flying and Inspecting in the Air. They Protected the Injured Plane and Fled to the Gongda Yarn Factory.</h3>
<h3>Situation on the Wusong Front</h3>
<p>Our Army's Artillery Hit the Enemy's Headquarters</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Again Massacred People in Yinhangzhen</p>
<p>The Captured Workers Cursed the Enemy's Brutality</p>
<p>On the Wusong and Yunzaobang Fronts, Since the Night Before, the Enemy and Our Army's Lines Still Held Firmly Across the Bang. From Time to Time, There Was Small Contact Between the Outposts of Both Sides, But It Was Not Very Intense. Only the Enemy's Warships and Planes Had Several Times Bombed Our Fort and the Yunzaobang Area. As a Result, Our Army's Defensive Line Was Still Not Moved. The Battle Situation of Both Sides and the Enemy's Brutal Acts Are Recorded Separately Below.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Ships' Artillery Attacks Had No Results On the Wusong Front Yesterday (25th), the Enemy Army and Our Army Still Remotely Defended Across the Yunzaobang and Did Not Have Very Fierce Contact. But the Enemy Navy Sent Three Enemy Ships From Time to Time From the Night Before (23rd) to Yesterday Afternoon to Bomb the Fort, Songzhen, Yunzaobang, and Other Places. The First Time Was From About 8:20 PM to 10:40 PM the Night Before. The Second Time Was From About 2:00 AM to 4:10 AM Yesterday Morning. The Third Time Was From About 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM Yesterday Morning. The Fourth Time Was From About 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM Yesterday Afternoon. Each Time the Enemy Ships Bombed More Than a Hundred Shells. When the Enemy Ships Bombarded Each Time, Our Army Was Exceptionally Calm and Defended to the Death, So the Defensive Line Was Not Changed at All. The Enemy Army Wasted Hundreds of Shells, Which Can Be Said to Be Completely Without Results.</h3>
<h3>Fierce Battle Between Both Sides at Jijiqiao Yesterday Morning At About 9:00 AM, An Enemy Yuanjiang Maru Loaded With About 500 Enemy Soldiers Sailed From Shanghai to the Liangmizhan Wharf to Land. The Contact Between the Sentries of Our Two Armies From Yunzaobang to Jijiqiao From Dawn to 3:00 PM Yesterday Was in All Places. Intermittent Rifle Sounds Came From East to West. From 7:00 PM the Night Before, More Than 2,000 Enemy Soldiers Used Heavy Artillery and Field Artillery to Cover Several Fierce Attacks on Our Army's Position. As a Result, All Were Repelled by Our Army. The Fierce Battle Between Both Sides Continued All Night Until the Enemy Army Began to Retreat Yesterday Morning.</h3>
<h3>Enemy Planes Dropped Bombs One After Another At the Same Time As the Enemy Ships' Third Attack, Four Enemy Planes Flew to Our Army's Position and Threw Bombs Randomly. Two Bombs Fell on the Jinjiazai of the North Shore of Yunzaobang and the Hujiaqiao of the South Shore, Which Immediately Caused a Fire at the Same Time. Our Army Then Opened Anti-Aircraft Guns to Shoot at the Enemy Planes. At About 11:00 AM, One Enemy Plane Was Almost Hit by Our Army's Anti-Aircraft Guns. The Enemy Plane Fled in Panic to the Outside. According to Another Report, Twelve Enemy Planes Flew From the Outside Sea at About 8:00 AM Yesterday Morning, First Flying and Reconnoitering Over the North and South Forts, and Then Flying South. When the Enemy Planes Passed Our Army's Position in Yunzaobang, They Threw More Than a Dozen Bombs One After Another. Our Army's Position Was Not Damaged Much. One Bomb Accidentally Fell on the Houjia Tomb Near the Yangjiazai of Zhanghuabang, Destroying the Corpse Coffin in the Tomb and Killing Two Enemy Sentries Who Were Lying Behind the Tomb. The Enemy Planes Were Soon Repelled by Our Army's Anti-Aircraft Guns and Flew to the Southwest.</h3>

<h3>Residents of Yinhangzhen Suffered Misfortune A Reporter Met Nanmin Yin Amu at Donggukou Yesterday Who Had Escaped From Yinhangzhen the Night Before. According to Him, After the Enemy Army Attacked Yunzaobang, That Zhen Fell Into the Enemy Army's Battle Line. There Were Hundreds of Male and Female Residents in That Town Who Had Not Been Able to Escape. The Enemy Soldiers Had Not Disturbed Them at First, So the Hundreds of Male and Female Residents Were Still Able to Live in Peace Despite Being Frightened. Unexpectedly, At About 10:00 AM the Day Before Yesterday, More Than 30 Enemy Soldiers Suddenly Came to That Town and Searched Door to Door, Startling the Residents. They Hurriedly Scattered and Fled. When the Enemy Soldiers Saw This, They Opened Fire. More Than 20 Men and Women Died or Were Injured by Gunfire Immediately, and Most of the Rest Were Captured by the Enemy Soldiers and Whipped Severely. Yin and a Man Named Lin Were Faster to Flee and Fortunately Escaped. They Then Fled to Waisha to Hide on the Bank of the Pu River Until 9:00 PM the Night Before When They Found a Small Boat and Escaped to Donggou by Boat to Escape the Danger. According to Residents of Donggukou, on the Eve of the Previous Day, They Saw the Japanese Ship Chishima Maru Fully Loaded With Enemy Soldiers Entering the Port and Sailing to Shanghai. At the Same Time, They Saw Two Enemy Warships Following in Front and Behind to Protect It.</h3>
<h3>The Enemy Army's Brutal Acts were Reported in Detail Yesterday to This 館 by Shen Yingsheng, a Worker Who Escaped From Jijiazhai, Wusong. I Will Record His Report Below. Shen 君 Said That I Was Originally a Worker in the Mud Dredging Department of the 本埠浚浦局 and Lived Near Jijiazhai, Wusong. Unfortunately, I Was Captured by the Zhanghuabang Brigade of Japanese Soldiers and Sent to Serve, and Was Unable to Escape for Several Days. On the Day of My Capture, the Japanese Soldiers Completely Took Off My Clothes and Pants and Tied My Flesh Body to a Pillar in the House for Two Days and One Night. After the Liberation, They Forced Me to Serve as a Guide. There Were Also Many Young Women Who Were Captured to Wash Clothes and Cook. If They Did Not Do Well, They Would Be Tortured or Beaten, or Killed With Rifles or Killed With Sharp Knives. When Their Animal Nature Erupted, They Would Commit Lewd Acts. Six Japanese Soldiers Raped One Woman in Turns, and Even Elderly Women Who Were 52 Years Old Could Not Escape. All the Chickens, Ducks, Pigs, and Sheep in the Village Were Killed, Clothes and Objects Were Looted, and Houses Were Burned to the Ground. The Various Illegal Acts Cannot Be Described With Pen and Ink. It Is Also Said That After I Was Captured, the Japanese Military Headquarters Was Stationed in the Residence of Gu Xizhong in Nian Ertu. There Were About 200 Japanese Soldiers and They Could Speak Shanghai. In the Previous Days, the Japanese Army Launched Four Sneak Attacks on Our Army's Position. Fortunately, Our Army's Position Was Solid and the Japanese Army Could Not Cross the Leichi Pool.</h3>
<h3>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun Admits That a Brigade Was Annihilated</h3>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun Carried a Special Telegram From the Joint Society on the 22nd. The Artillery Battle Between the Two Sides Has Been Extremely Fierce in Recent Days. Our Navy, Army, and Air Force (Japanese Army) Attacked Simultaneously on the Zhabei and Jiangwan Fronts. Unexpectedly, When Our Army (Japanese Army) Arrived Near the Siming Guild Hall, the Entire Artillery Team Led by the Artillery Commander Jinshi Was Suddenly Surrounded by the Enemy Army and the Brigade Was Completely Annihilated. Also, the Okubo Brigade Was Attacked From the Side by the Enemy Army (Our Army) in Zhoujiazhen and the Entire Army Was Annihilated. Since the 21st, 116 People Have Been Recovered From the Jiangwan Field Hospital. The Number of Deaths Was Not Counted, and About 60 or 70 People Who Could Not Be Recovered Were Left on the Front Line. The Magnitude of the Loss Is Self-Evident.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Xinlonghua for Days</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Six More Large Bombs Were Dropped</p>
<p>Destroying Five Western-Style Houses and Civilian Houses</p>
<p>The Japanese Army's Repeated Bombing of Cultural Institutions and Innocent Civilian Houses Violates International Law and Humanitarianism. European and American Public Opinion Has Repeatedly Expressed Indignation at This Brutal Act. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Army's Brutal Acts Have Increased. On the Previous Two Days, Japanese Planes Flew to Xinlonghua Again and Dropped More Than a Dozen 200-Pound Bombs. Xinlonghua Is Located in the Remote South of Shanghai and Is Far Away From the Weapon Yard. All the Destroyed Buildings Are Farm 民房. On the Previous Day, Six Japanese Planes Dropped 12 Bombs in Xinlonghua. Yesterday Morning, Three More Planes Flew to Xinlonghua to Reconnoiter and Did Not Drop Bombs. Unexpectedly, At 4:00 PM, Three Japanese Planes Came to Xinlonghua Again and Dropped Six Large Bombs. The Sound of the Bombing Was Heard for Miles. A Reporter Heard the News and Rushed to Investigate. He Saw That a Tall Western-Style House South of Xinlonghua Station Was Destroyed. On the East Side, the Farmhouses Were Closely Arranged and All Were Old-Style Flat Houses. Yesterday, Four Buildings Were Bombed. When the Reporter Arrived, the Local Farmers, Men and Women, Were Tearfully Searching for Clothes and Bedding in the Rubble. An Old Woman Was Weeping With a Child in Her Arms. The Old Woman's Feet Had Been Injured in the Bombing. She Was Helped to See a Doctor by Neighbors. Many Local Farmers Were Watching in the Crowd, and All Were Filled With Grief and Indignation. A Middle-Aged Woman Was Standing in the Crowd Crying and Asked About Her Husband's Disappearance. She Was Afraid That He Had Been Killed in the Bombing. Before Long, a Man Came Out From the Broken Wall With Bedding. It Was Her Husband. The Woman Began to Suppress Her Sadness, but Her Property Was Gone. A Huge Hole Was Found in the Field, Which Was More Than Ten Feet Deep and As Big As a Pond. The Huge Tree Next to It Was Broken and Fell to the Ground, Which Shows the Fierceness of the Bombing. The Bones of the Corpses Whose Coffins Were Blown Up and the Coffin Boards Were Shattered Were Even More Tragically Unrecognizable. It Can Even Be Said That It Affected the Fish in the Pond Because the Fish Killed in the Nearby Small River by the Bombing Were Turned Up From the Bottom of the River and Scattered All Over the Ground.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Enemy Aircraft Bombing Everywhere</h3>
<p>The Target Remains the Zhabei and Zhenru Areas</p>
<p>Bombing of a Passenger Train in Nanxiang Kills and Injures Six People</p>
<p>The enemy army, suffering successive defeats and shamed to the point of desperation, has had no choice but to dispatch batches of planes for indiscriminate bombing to vent their frustration. Yesterday morning, reporters from this newspaper inspected Zhenru and learned from a certain military officer that enemy planes have been flying over our military positions for days, reconnoitering and dropping bombs constantly. Moreover, they fly at extremely high altitudes, making it difficult for anti-aircraft guns to hit them. Yesterday afternoon (the day before), four trucks of the Boy Scouts Battlefield Service Corps happened to be passing by when an enemy plane flew in a triangular formation and dropped three 200-plus-pound bombs simultaneously. Fortunately, the planes were flying too high, and none of them hit. Otherwise, the four trucks would have been reduced to powder, they said. Yesterday, the enemy planes were even more active, flying all day long, and their target remained the Zhabei, Zhenru, and Dachang areas. They even flew to Nanxiang, attempting to disrupt transportation. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Fiercely Bomb Zhenru. The night before last, seven enemy</h3>
<p>planes flew over Zhenru, dropping three bombs, four of which landed on the eastern embankment of Yangjia Bridge. Two sections of the railway tracks along the railway line were destroyed, but they were immediately repaired. Two bombs landed on the wasteland south of the railway. The others landed in the fields of Dajidong, causing no casualties. Only a bloody dog tail was found in the bomb crater at the railway site. According to eyewitnesses, the enemy's original intention seemed to be to destroy the railway bridge parallel to the Yangjia wooden bridge, but they dared not fly low due to our artillery fire. At 9:30 yesterday morning, another plane came and dropped two bombs in an open area before flying towards Nanxiang. Around 2:00 p.m., three Japanese planes flew over the Zhenru area, firing guns and dropping bombs. Three bombs were dropped near Gujiazhai, all in the fields, injuring two farmers. One bomb was dropped near Xiao Chenjiazhai, knocking down a large tree. Several bombs also landed near the back temple of Zhenru, all in the fields, only creating several deep holes, it was said.</p>

<h3>Bombing of a Passenger Train in Nanxiang. At approximately 9:00 a.m. yesterday,</h3>
<p>nine Japanese planes suddenly reappeared over Nanxiang. At that time, more than ten sections of our Beijing-Shanghai passenger train were parked next to the station. The Japanese planes then dropped more than ten bombs, two of which landed on the parked passenger cars, which were then destroyed. At the same time, they used machine guns to strafe the civilians. According to people from Nanxiang, in addition to the more than ten sections of passenger cars being bombed, it was reported that an old woman was killed and five pedestrians were injured.</p>
<h3>Houses Destroyed and People Injured in Zhabei. Yesterday, at around eight</h3>
<p>o'clock in the morning, nine Japanese planes, divided into three groups, came to the Zhabei area, including Qiujiang Road, Baoxing Road, and Qingyun Road, firing guns and dropping bombs to assist the fighting. Our army used machine guns and anti-aircraft guns to bombard them. At around ten o'clock, one plane was damaged and fled eastward, and the rest also flew westward. More than ten bombs were dropped on areas such as Gonghe Xin Road, Yongxing Road, and Zhonghua Xin Road, destroying two civilian houses and killing three poor people. A hole more than a foot deep was blasted on Liuying Road, injuring one pedestrian. They only left when it got dark.</p>
<h3>Wounded Soldiers Determined to Defend the Country</h3>
<p>Eager to Fully Recover Immediately</p>
<p>And Return to the Front to Kill Enemies</p>
<p>According to a wounded soldier in a certain hospital yesterday, he had experienced many battles and had been wounded before. But in the past, when he was wounded, almost no one cared, and death was as light as a feather. Now, he is fighting for the country, and not only is he well-fed and clothed, but anything he needs is provided immediately. Therefore, his comrades all believe that this time, death would be heavier than Mount Tai, and they all have a firm determination to defend our country against the Japanese invaders. My injury is not serious, and I am eager to fully recover immediately and return to the front to kill enemies, he said. The morale of our army is evident from this.</p>

<h3>Nanshi Tightens Martial Law</h3>
<p>To Prevent Counter-Revolutionary Elements from Sabotaging</p>
<p>Yesterday, the security in the Nanshi area was further tightened. Police were stationed at every post near Laoximen, and the Bao'an Tuan (Security Corps) was also armed and patrolling. There were also soldiers stationed at Xiaoximen. According to the City Public Security Bureau, this security measure was based on a secret report that counter-revolutionary elements were plotting sabotage, so it was specially tightened.</p>
<h3>Our Wounded Platoon Leader Talks About the Joy of Killing Enemies</h3>
<p>Platoon Leader Chang Zhi, from Kaifeng</p>
<p>One Person With the Courage of Several</p>
<p>Killing Two Enemies and Wounding One</p>
<p>Says He Will Have No Regrets Even If He Dies</p>
<p>The Japanese army has repeatedly been defeated in its invasion of Shanghai. In order to maintain its reputation as a strong country, it gathered a large army on the 20th to attack Miaohang. The enemy army repeatedly launched fierce assaults, but our army's heroic killing of the enemy ultimately prevailed. Yesterday, the reporter met Chang Zhi, a platoon leader from Kaifeng, with the 00th Division, 00th Regiment, at a certain hospital. Chang Zhi told the reporter that our army has been fighting fiercely with the enemy in Miaohang for several days. Although the enemy army charged fiercely at us with sharp weapons, our soldiers all had a determination to die and fought with all their strength. As a result, thousands of enemy soldiers were annihilated and countless spoils of war were seized. The Japanese army was almost routed. Later, a large number of reinforcements arrived the night before last, and the remnants were reorganized to attack together. The fighting is still fierce. At dawn yesterday, the two sides were engaged in hand-to-hand combat. I immediately fixed my bayonet and stabbed a Japanese soldier in the leg. The Japanese soldier fled wounded. Seeing two Japanese soldiers approaching, I immediately fired two shots from my rifle, and the two Japanese soldiers fell to the ground. Later, I was shot twice, once in the left arm and once in the chest, and collapsed. I was rescued by my comrades and taken to the hospital by the Red Cross ambulance. However, I have killed two enemies and wounded one. My wish has been fulfilled, and I will have no regrets even if I die. If I can recover my health in a short period of time and go to the front line to kill a few more enemies, I would be even more delighted. After hearing these words, the reporter deeply admired Platoon Leader Chang's loyalty and bravery, and repeatedly encouraged him before taking leave.</p>
<h3>Important News from the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>The Consulate Moves into Warships The Japanese Consul-General stationed in Shanghai, Murai Kuramatsu, in view of the occasional stray bullets falling near the consulate, has moved all important documents and files of the consulate to warships yesterday to avoid danger, and has also moved important parts and office personnel to warships to work.</p>
<h3>Enemy Equipment Moved from Waibu Since the start of the war,</h3>
<p>the Toyama Wharf of the Japanese Post Office in Yangshupu has been the base for the Japanese army, and also the storage place for a large amount of military supplies. The military equipment shipped from Japan to Shanghai is stored in the warehouses of the wharf. Since the Japanese army was defeated on the 22nd, 50 Japanese soldiers guarding the warehouse fled in a hurry. Since then, the enemy army has not dared to store military equipment in Waibu and has moved it elsewhere. Even the reinforcements that arrived in Shanghai recently have changed to landing at the Osaka and Huangpu wharves.</p>
<h3>More Japanese Soldiers Arrived Yesterday Japan continues to send the 11th</h3>
<p>Division to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, more than 3,000 soldiers were transported and landed at Zhanghuabang. There were also a large number of military supplies. In the afternoon, a Japanese 30th torpedo boat entered the port at 1:50 p.m., also carrying nearly a thousand Japanese soldiers, and sailed into the Osaka Wharf in Huangpu to disembark.</p>
<h3>Number of Japanese Officer Casualties In the Battle of Miaohang,</h3>
<p>the Japanese army used all of its land forces and joined the front line in an attempt to break through our line. Our army met them head-on and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The fierceness of the fighting on both sides was the first since the start of the war. The corpses of Japanese soldiers who died in battle piled up like mountains. According to Ueda Radio Tokyo, in the battle of Miaohang on the night of the 24th, the Japanese officers who died in battle included eight captains, twelve first lieutenants, and fifty-seven second lieutenants. The positions of captains, first lieutenants, and second lieutenants are the positions of battalion, company, and platoon leaders. If the death toll of officers is so high, then the casualties of their soldiers can be imagined.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Evening Post Refutes the Japanese Note</h3>
<p>Denies That the Japanese Army is Fighting for the Citizens</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post stated that the Japanese government, through its ambassador to Washington, notified the US government that its reinforcements to Shanghai were because the security of Shanghai required the removal of Chinese troops who were endangering the city from the range of artillery fire. The implication is that the Japanese army's fighting is to protect the citizens of Shanghai. This unreasonable claim must be refuted. We deny that the Japanese army is fighting for our citizens. We deny that the security of Shanghai requires more Japanese troops or any Japanese troops. We deny that Shanghai is currently endangered by anyone or anything. The only thing that exists is the artillery fire exchanged between the Chinese and Japanese armies. The war in front of our homes was entirely caused by the Japanese. We deny that Japan's reinforcements to Shanghai have any other purpose than to defeat China. We denounce the Japanese for instigating this tragic war, which is an attempt to occupy Zhabei, Chinese territory, by force, in order to force the Chinese government to recognize Japan's demands regarding Manchuria and to cancel the boycott movement caused by the Manchuria incident. We denounce the Japanese army for using the concessions as a base for war against China, which has put us in danger and greatly strained the Chinese authorities' restraint of their indignant army and people. We denounce the Japanese for the massacre and mistreatment of innocent Chinese civilians who should be protected by the concession authorities, which has further put us in danger, because the Chinese are demanding that Chinese troops be allowed to protect their compatriots because the concession police or defense forces cannot stop this brutality. We completely reject any attempt to link the citizens of Shanghai to the military aggression and atrocities being carried out around us. Bombing quiet villages and massacring innocent villagers is by no means defending the citizens. Whatever the concessions are entitled to, and should never have, Japan's so-called danger does not exist. What we have stated above is indeed the danger. Alas, Japan's evil will eventually be repaid in kind.</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Awaits Orders to Kill Enemies</h3>
<p>Reply to Wei Daoming's Telegram</p>
<p>Wei Daoming, the former mayor of Nanjing, telegraphed Song Zheyuan on the 20th of this month to report on the situation in Shanghai. Yesterday, he received his reply, which read: "Mayor Wei Bocong Jian, your telegram received with respect. The fact that our army in Shanghai is resisting the strong enemy and repeatedly thwarting their attacks is truly a matter of national survival and is deeply admired. I am currently inspecting the troops and inspiring the courage of the officers and soldiers, sleeping on our weapons awaiting orders to fight the Japanese invaders. Sincerely, Song Zheyuan, bowing respectfully."</p>
<h3>Traitors and Merchants Who Have Lost Their Minds and Gone Mad</h3>
<p>Selling Out the Country Under Enemy Fire</p>
<p>Traitors Executed The day before yesterday, two traitors were apprehended by police officers outside Ximen, on Huining Road, while attempting to sabotage. Explosives were found, and they were immediately sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. They were executed by firing squad in a wasteland near the South Railway Station yesterday afternoon. Furthermore, yesterday, detectives from the City Public Security Bureau, Hu Baoxiang, Zeng Huatang, Chen Caifu, etc., arrested a traitor, Shen Yasun, while inspecting pedestrians in the Zhongshan Road area. A Japanese copper coin and secret symbols were found on his person. After questioning, he confessed that he had been bought by the Japanese side to scout military intelligence in Dachang and did not deny it. He also stole two large bags of clothes, 65 pieces of clothing, and a lot of gold and silver jewelry from there. He was sent to the Sixth District Headquarters for disposal.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Throw Bombs Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m., two rickshaw pullers suddenly pulled empty rickshaws to the Xiaoximen entrance, each taking out bombs and throwing them. People panicked for a moment and threw the bombs on sandbags, fortunately they did not explode. Pedestrians had already seen them and shouted, and were joined by police officers and members of the Bao'an Tuan to arrest them. At that time, there were about a dozen rickshaws running away in the road, and the two rickshaws in question escaped in the crowd and were not apprehended.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of Treacherous Merchants The City Chamber of Commerce, based on secret reports from various places, has already investigated the behavior of treacherous merchants assisting the enemy. Excerpts are listed below: 1. Zhenxin Rice Store at the intersection of Zhaofeng Road and Youheng Road has been assisting the enemy. The goods are shipped out around 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. every night, escorted by Japanese trucks, etc. The association has instructed the Rice Store Association to conduct a strict investigation. 2. Chen Huipin, the owner of Xiangtai Automobile Company on Xin Dagu Road, is blinded by profit and manufactures nine military transport trucks for the enemy. It is reported that the Public Security Bureau has sent personnel to investigate. 3. A person resembling a White Russian went to Pan Shunji Automobile Company at the entrance of Yihe Lane, Gordon Road, to rent four or five trucks to transport coal. Later, it was seen that the trucks were transporting flour. The association believes that although the person renting the trucks was a White Russian, the instigator must be Japanese, and the White Russian is just a puppet. The association immediately forwarded a letter to the Automobile Association to send personnel to investigate. Furthermore, at approximately 8:00 a.m. yesterday, Shunchang Mechanical Stone Powder Factory, which opened on Bailinan Road, was secretly selling a truckload of stone powder, escorted by the factory staff Ma Renquan and Lu Gengsheng, intending to supply it to the enemy army. They were questioned by Chinese police officers near the Fanhuangdu Station on Yuyuan Road. The factory's deliverymen stammered and acted suspiciously. Chen from the Transportation Group of the 19th Route Army saw them and immediately stepped forward to question them strictly, increasing their suspicions. It was proven that they were indeed assisting the enemy. Ma Renquan and Lu Gengsheng were immediately detained and sent to the headquarters of the 19th Route Army for verification. The truck of stone powder was then lost.</p>

<p>Support Government's Active Resistance Plan</p>
<p>The Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai telegraphed He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Affairs, in reply, stating: "Minister He Jingzhi of Nanjing, your respectful telegram received with respect. With the great enemy pressing on the border, there is no other way than to endure the pain and fight to the death. Your words are truly commendable. Yesterday, we received Minister Chen's telegram from Zhenru and learned that the Central Government has decided on a national active resistance plan, and the reinforcements sent by the government are also arriving one after another. We are all pleased to hear this. With the overall plan set, from now on, the entire party and the entire country must unite and strive for the country's defense. We believe that the final victory will surely belong to us. The Central Committee members in Shanghai have been notified to rush to the meeting. Special telegram reply.

<h3>The Association for the Nurturing of the Families of Patriotic Martyrs</h3>
<p>Initiated by Xu Shiying and Others</p>
<p>Meeting to be Held on the 27th</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, when the violent Japanese invaded Shanghai, we have relied heavily on the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers of our 19th Route Army to resist insults and swear to resist to the death, repeatedly thwarting the enemy and bringing glory to the nation and the country. However, the number of those who sacrificed their lives for the country is also considerable. Therefore, celebrities in Shanghai, Xu Shiying, Zhu Qinglan, Wang Zhen, Du Yuesheng, and other elders have initiated the Association for the Nurturing of the Families of Patriotic Martyrs to raise funds to comfort the loyal souls and care for the bereaved families. The inaugural meeting will be held on the 27th of this month at Renji Hall. Now, the reasons for the initiation of the association are excerpted below: "The violent Japanese have destroyed international conventions and carried out armed aggression. They have already occupied our three northeastern provinces and are now attacking our Shanghai urban area. They have driven their barbaric land, sea, and air forces and launched fierce artillery fire and bombs to destroy our cultural institutions and massacre our unarmed people. Robbers rampage, causing concern both domestically and internationally. Fortunately, our 19th Route Army has sworn to resist to the death, fighting bravely and relentlessly, and repeatedly thwarting the enemy's attacks. Over the past two weeks, countless enemies have been killed. This is not only for the nation to survive and for the country to fight for its dignity, but also to uphold justice and maintain world peace, and to express the grievances of the League of Nations. The loyal and courageous sacrifices of the officers and soldiers have their own great significance. The public should admire their merits and repay their kindness, and should comfort the loyal souls. Shiying, Qinglan, Zhen, Hanzhi, Qicai, Xiaolin, Yuesheng, Xiaolai, Jin, etc., have initiated the Association for the Nurturing of the Families of Patriotic Martyrs to raise funds for the bereaved families of officers and soldiers of the land, sea, and air forces who died in battle while defending the country and resisting Japan, providing them with care and education according to their age, so that each can live a full life. Together, we will gather the strength of the people to fulfill the responsibilities of those who come after, etc."</p>

<h3>Rescue Work</h3>
<p>Urgently Rescue the Wounded Soldiers at the Forefront. It is heard from the wounded soldiers rescued from the front line that there are numerous wounded soldiers in the areas where the two armies are fighting fiercely. However, because there are too many airplanes and bombs in the area, most of the rescue teams only work in areas relatively far from the front line. As a result, the front line cannot act freely, and the wounded soldiers groan in pain, suffer from hunger and cold, and there is no one to rescue them. The number of those who lose their lives due to excessive blood loss is countless. If they can be rescued immediately, there is a good chance of recovery. The wounded soldier also said that the front-line soldiers are busy responding to the enemy and have no time to take care of their injured compatriots. He earnestly hopes that the Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, and the rear people will organize more rescue teams to bravely go to the forefront to rescue the loyal and brave soldiers who have been wounded for the country.</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan and others are enthusiastic about rescue. The 23rd Wounded Soldiers Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society has been established for only a few days, and all internal facilities are quite perfect. This is entirely due to the enthusiasm and hard work of the staff and the dedicated service of the volunteers. It is heard that General Zhu Qinglan, President Zhang Peinian, and Deputy Section Chief Gao Dajing are particularly enthusiastic about the hospital affairs. In addition to being responsible for supplying all the supplies to the hospital, they must personally visit and comfort the wounded soldiers every day. Director of Medical Affairs Wang Min also shows great medical skills. His medical methods are quick, and the wounded soldiers are all pleased. The responsible personnel in the hospital, such as Wu Jialong, Wang Zugui, and Shen Jixian, are able to represent the spirit of the Lishi Society in serving the military. Their attitude is sincere, their work is quick, and their handling of affairs is appropriate. They are models of those who serve the military and talented members of the Lishi Society. Most of the staff in the hospital are young men and women who bravely enter the hospital to serve. Among them, there is an American woman named Shao who also volunteered to enter the hospital as a nurse. It is heard that General Zhu, President Zhang, and Deputy Section Chief Gao are now planning a larger hospital, which will be established in a few days.</p>
<p>Zheng Yuxiu Borrows a School to Run a Hospital. The Wounded Soldiers Hospital of the National Crisis Soldiers Rescue Association, initiated by Mrs. Chen Mingshu, Mrs. Cai Tingkai, Mrs. Jiang Guangnai, Mrs. Liao Zhongkai, and Mrs. Liu Peiquan, was originally intended to be established and begin accepting wounded soldiers who had been wounded while defending the country as soon as possible. However, because there was no suitable hospital site, Mrs. Chen and others searched outside, forgetting to eat and sleep, and were extremely uneasy. It was learned that the buildings of the French College of Political Science and Law on Jin Shenfu Road in this city were spacious, the location was suitable, and it was very suitable for a hospital site. Since school had not yet started, they went to discuss with Dr. Zheng Yuxiu, the president of the college, to borrow it for temporary use. After receiving the request, President Zheng readily agreed. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, the association sent staff and all items to arrange the site. Unexpectedly, a small number of students came out to stop them, claiming that they had to attend classes on a regular basis, and they also removed the white cloth banner of the temporary hospital that the association had hung up. Before long, President Zheng heard the news and was very dissatisfied. She immediately drove to the school and gave a generous speech to the small number of students staying at the school, saying that at this time when the violent sun is invading the country and the life and death of the country are at stake, our 19th Route Army is loyal, and all the soldiers are loyal to the front line, bravely fighting the enemy and adding glory to the country. If we hold selfish ideas and refuse to sacrifice, what can be said about the destruction of the country? Before she finished speaking, one or two female students shed tears. Then, Yang, the director of the school, continued to explain the matter, and it was settled, and preparations were carried out as usual. Mrs. Chen and others thanked President Zheng for her enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Father Qiao of Aurora University is enthusiastic. After Aurora University allowed the Red Swastika Society to use the west dormitory to accommodate Chinese wounded soldiers, at first only dozens of people were sent there for treatment. However, the number of people who arrived yesterday and today suddenly increased. Father Qiao of the school specially allowed the newly built auditorium in the playground to be used by the Chinese Red Cross Society to accommodate wounded soldiers. Yesterday, more than a hundred people arrived there, and the entire hall was filled in an instant. Medical students from the unified school diligently served, and Chinese people went to express their condolences in an endless stream.</p>
<p>Customs officials are enthusiastic about relief. Customs officials have always been enthusiastic about social welfare undertakings. This time, when the Shanghai war broke out, the donations were even more enthusiastic. The donation director of the 7th Rescue Team of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Mrs. Chen Mingshu, Mrs. Zeng Zisheng, and Ms. Ouyang Huizhen, raised 4,800 yuan from the General Taxation Department and the Jianghai Customs, plus 990 taels of cash. It is heard that Mrs. Chen and others have reported it separately.</p>
<p>The Buddhist Association's Departure for Rescue. Since the Buddhist Association established its rescue team, it has been working on the front line for days. Today, Abbot Zhenya and Lay Buddhist Sha Shouzhong and others went to the Dachang Zhenji Temple for rescue. Dharma Masters Hongsan and Changxing and Lay Buddhist Zhao Xueshao and others prepared a large number of items to comfort the wounded soldiers. It is also heard that the association is expanding its publicity and expanding its promotion to Buddhist followers across the country.</p>
<p>Famous doctors organize temporary medical teams. Famous doctors in Shanghai, Dugu Zi, Chen Qixiang, and Wang Songnan, and others, in view of the fact that the refugees in Zhabei and Hongkou in this city, although sheltered, lacked medical teams, have each raised funds to set up a general office opposite Moore Church on Sanma Road. They first elected doctors from various departments to set off in teams to dispense medicines. However, the economy is extremely difficult, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate. The declaration of the team is recorded as follows: The country is in a state of decline, and the Japanese invaders are invading. Not only have they lost our Northeast, but they are also disturbing our Songhu. As a result of the war, residents are displaced, and the Qiu Jian is in ruins. Fortunately, our 19th Route Army is resisting and fighting bravely. More than a week has passed, and the loss of life and property of the people is countless. Those who endure hunger and thirst, brave the wind and rain, and cross the fire line only reside in safe areas. Unfortunately, many of them suffer from diseases. Colleagues and others are familiar with medicine and witness the difficulties of the times, so they organized the Shanghai Bingzai Refugee Temporary Medical Team. They set off in groups every day to provide practical diagnosis and treatment to various shelters and places where refugees gather. It is hoped that benevolent gentlemen will support us with one heart. Those who have the strength will contribute their strength, and those who have money will contribute their money, so that the refugees who groan in pain can all enjoy a healthy area. The small and foolish loyalty is fortunately observed. Office: Opposite Moore Church on Sanma Road. Initiators of the Shanghai Bingzai Refugee Temporary Medical Team: Dugu Zi, Chen Qixiang, Wan Zaichun, Zhang Li, Chen Shengchu, Zhan Tianmin, Kong Jinghong.</p>

Determined to kill the enemy and eager to be discharged from the hospital, yesterday they sent a letter to the Red Cross Society for transfer to the front line. The courage of these soldiers is commendable, and the spirit of our country can be seen here. The day before yesterday, Mr. Xu Jilong went to the hospital to express his condolences to the injured officers and soldiers and distributed towels and fruits to them. Yesterday, Mrs. Chen Mingshu and Mrs. Jiang Guangnai went to express their condolences and gave each person shirts, cotton trousers, jackets, vests, and food. The acting director of the hospital, Shen Yibin, expressed his sincere thanks and entrusted the two ladies to convey their condolences to all the soldiers on the front line and asked them to persevere to the end and win the final victory.</p>
<p>Pudong begins to investigate and provide rice. The Pudong Fellow Villagers Association convened local gentry and merchants at the Pudong Second District Public Security Bureau the day before yesterday afternoon to discuss ways to provide relief to refugees. Director Zhang was temporarily elected as chairman. The following methods were agreed upon as a result of the discussion: ① Establish shelters in Zhoupu and Yangsi Towns first, and then continue to establish them in Xiangji in Tangji, Sanlin, Nanmatou, Laobaidu, Lannidu, and Qichangzhan. ② Investigate the number of unemployed poor people in each village lane who are truly poor and give them rice tickets in three types: one sheng, two sheng, and five sheng. This investigation will first be reported by honest and reliable people in each village lane, and then the association will review the report to ensure its accuracy before rice tickets can be issued. ③ If there are those who are willing to return to their hometown but have no travel expenses, the association can help them obtain free tickets to avoid wandering in other places.</p>
<h3>The Law Society Sends Telegrams to Various Countries Asking Them to Pay Attention to the Situation in the Far East</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Law Society yesterday (25th) telegraphed Yan Huiqing, the Chinese representative to the League of Nations, to be forwarded to the representatives of various countries, lawyers of various countries, and parliaments of various countries, asking them to pay attention to the crisis in the Far East and not to be onlookers. The original telegram was translated into English, French, and Russian and distributed to newspapers in various countries for disclosure. The original telegram is published as follows: To Dr. Yan, Chinese Representative in Geneva, to be forwarded to the Law Societies of various countries, representatives of various countries to the League of Nations, and members of the parliaments of various countries for your consideration: World peace is superior to law, and force survives, while force prevails and law perishes. The European War lasted for eight years and exhausted the power of the world to strike a force. If it is so difficult to contain power with power, then after the pain has subsided, the masses will seek a way to bend power and extend the law. This is the origin of the League of Nations and the Washington Kellogg Pacts. Now the crisis in the world is approaching again! Although the chaos of 1914 may not reach as far as the current situation, its depth has already surpassed it. Why? At that time, the strong did not acknowledge the law, but they still did not lose their ambition to be the heroes of the overlords. However, Japan, as a civilized country in the world, is well aware of the international situation, and its desire for law is like the desire for years. It bears the title of a civilized power, and its envoys chant about non-war, but it uses all kinds of methods to eliminate thieves and indiscriminately bullies neighboring countries that are warm and unprepared. At first, it lightly attacked the border provinces that were thousands of miles away, and then it wantonly disturbed the ports of the Yellow River with thugs (such as Tianjin and Qingdao). Finally, it used a large army of sea and land forces to bombard Shanghai, the first commercial port in East Asia, and it did not dare to declare peace to the envoys of Britain, the United States, and France. The humiliating ultimatum was mixed with traces of its military actions, and it did everything it could to abuse women and children (women who were raped and then subjected to torture such as cutting breasts and gouging eyes), slaughter innocent civilians, destroy industrial and cultural institutions, and endanger the Red Cross Society and refugee shelters. All kinds of tyranny have never been seen in the history of both near and far. This shows its knowledge of the law, its destruction of the law, and its control of the power of the law. The market is full of honesty, stealing dogs and stealing wolves, greedily devouring sheep, and it is enough to betray civilization and shame mankind. Therefore, it is said that the depth of the situation exceeds that of the past. China is not incapable of fighting. Since January 28, the Japanese army has been exerting its strength, rushing and attacking, and suffering excessive casualties, but it has not succeeded. The fate of the war can be roughly known. Before this, not fighting was actually due to love of the law. Because of its love of the law, it loudly appealed and widely sought sympathy from the world. Are we colleagues who take the law as our profession, gentlemen of the League of Nations who command peace, and representatives of the national assembly who are one with the people, if they take the disaster in Shanghai as a corner and view the Far East as an onlooker, and are greedy for the momentary peace and security, and ignore the great plan of eternal peace, and remove the Tokyo diplomacy of distant alliances and close attacks, and erase the covenant of Geneva Dong Shengzai (such as Articles 10 to 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations), then if China dies in war, it will have its own price of seeking benevolence, and there is nothing to regret. However, the ancient sages commented on the political murderers that this person's ambition is to have no food. Today, the same is true for Japan. If this country's ambition is achieved, those who suffer will not only be China. Even if you do not seek for me, why not ask the world whether you will allow this to breed in the original war? Where will China stand in the world if this is the case? Sincerely, I implore you to examine it. Shanghai Law Society, You.</p>
<h3>Jiang Guangnai Comforts the Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Each person is also given 10 yuan.</p>

Therefore, yesterday, he specially issued a large amount of condolence money to the division commander for distribution to the wounded soldiers. The division commander received the condolence money and sent Xu Jingbo, the director of the medical office of the division, and Zhu Zhichen, a staff member of the office, to various Red Cross hospitals yesterday morning.

<h3>Wu Peifu Sends Telegrams to Comfort the Shanghai Army</h3>

The original telegram read: To General Commander Jiang, General Cai, General Zhang, Commander Dai, Division Commander Yu, and Division Commander Song, and to all division and brigade commanders: In the past two weeks, you and your officers and men have made repeated efforts to destroy the violent bandits. All countrymen deeply admire you. Yesterday, I received a telegram from Mr. Wu Ziyu from Beijing, asking me to express my condolences on his behalf and saying that the Japanese are increasing their troops, and although our army is not afraid of strong enemies, it is still hoped that more troops will be added to be more cautious and achieve complete victory for the entire army. I am sending this to you for your reference. Li Jingxun respectfully.</p>

<p>Domestic and Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>U.S. Far East Policy</h3>
<p>Announced in the Stimson Letter</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Stimson's letter to Senator Borah upholds the Open Door Policy in China, referring to his January 1st memorandum on the Far Eastern situation, stating that if other governments of the world adopt the same position, they can warn against acts that violate the covenant and prevent any title or right that seeks to maintain itself by pressure in violation of peace from being legal and effective. Stimson did not blame China or Japan but stated that the Nine-Power Treaty is a series of covenants that are interconnected and mutually supportive. The United States was willing to abandon its controlling position in the naval construction movement and not increase the defense projects of Guam and the Philippine Islands because it relied on the self-restraint clauses of the Nine-Power Treaty. This treaty guarantees equal opportunities for all countries in trade in the East, free from any military aggression by any country against China. Officials say that the U.S. attitude toward the Far East can be seen in Stimson's letter to Borah, which states "We firmly uphold the Open Door Principle and the Nine-Power Treaty." Stimson also said that at the time of the conclusion of the Nine-Power Treaty, China was developing its free system, and the signatory countries were willing to abandon any aggressive policies that could interfere with China. The New York Evening Post commented that Stimson's letter was "the most important announcement of American policy in the last ten years," and said that the entire policy launched by the Washington Conference, allowing Japan to enjoy maritime hegemony in one part of the world, will depend on whether a settlement of the Sino-Japanese question can be accepted. If Japan abuses its position, the United States may abandon its policy and create a naval base in the Pacific to prevent Japan from dominating China and all of China's great markets. Today, the Senate Naval Affairs Committee has given a favorable review report to the case of actively building a fleet within the scope permitted by the London Naval Treaty. The congressional response to naval matters in the current situation can be seen from this. (25th Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Stimson's letter to Borah clearly stated that the "self-restraining conditions" of the Nine-Power Treaty included the United States abandoning its leading position in building warships and agreeing that the United States would not increase the defense projects of Guam and the Philippines. It is impossible to amend the treaty without paying attention to this promise. (25th Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese public opinion regards Stimson's letter to Borah as a mistake, creating immeasurable harm and no benefit. The Japanese have denied violating the Nine-Power Treaty, so they believe that this letter will not only arouse national indignation but also strengthen the resistance of the Chinese army in Shanghai and increase the difficulty for the Japanese army to defeat the 19th Route Army to stabilize the overall situation. (25th Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>New York Republican and Democratic newspapers commented that Secretary of State Stimson's letter to Borah was a great declaration of American Far East policy. The New York World said that Stimson's declaration was a forceful rebuttal to Yoshizawa's weak arguments and clearly indicated how and why the balance of power in the Pacific established by various treaties signed in 1921-1922 would be disrupted once the treaty guaranteeing China's immunity from aggression lost its effect.

<h3>French Ambassador to the U.S. Denies Franco-Japanese Secret Agreement</h3>
<p>The U.S. and France have always cooperated fully</p>
<p>(Washington) French Ambassador to the United States Claudel, in view of widespread reports in American newspapers that France and Japan had a secret agreement on Manchuria and Annam, and that France was not cooperating sincerely with the major powers on the Sino-Japanese dispute, especially harboring doubts about the United Kingdom and the United States, specifically requested instructions from his government. The Paris government has now instructed Claudel to issue a declaration in Washington, strongly denying the claim that France is not cooperating with the major powers. Claudel stated that the French government has fully cooperated with the United States on the Far Eastern incident and does not recognize any secret agreement, conditions, or understanding between the French and Japanese governments. Claudel said that he was quite concerned about these rumors but knew that they were merely rumors without any basis. According to the diplomatic community here, French Foreign Minister Weldon is quite anxious about the trend of American public opinion. American views on France's financial policies and the rumor that France would withdraw reserve funds from the United States are all sufficient to stimulate the psychology of Americans and endanger the friendship between the two countries. However, diplomatic observers feel that France did withdraw a large amount of funds from New York in the early winter of last year. The impact of this move by France on the politics between the two countries is extremely great, no matter what France's intentions are, the result is clearly visible. In addition, the recent rumors that France will withdraw deposits from the United States have made Americans even more uneasy. Furthermore, before issuing today's declaration, French Ambassador Claudel visited Undersecretary of State Kessler at the State Department and later stated to others "no comment." It is said that the French ambassador is constantly communicating with the United States on how to deal with the situation in the Far East. (24th Kuomintang News Agency telegram)</p>

<h3>Japan Sends General to Shanghai</h3>

Shirakawa is a member of the Supreme Military Council and participated in the Russo-Japanese War. In 1921, he commanded the 11th Division in Siberia. From 1925 to 1927, he commanded the Kwantung Army. From 1927 to 1929, he served as Minister of the Army. (25th Reuters telegram)</p>
<h3>British League of Nations Society Calls for Ceasefire in the Far East</h3>

<h3>Soviet Foreign Minister's Statement on Disarmament</h3>
<p>(Geneva) At today's meeting of the Disarmament Conference, when it was unanimously agreed to adopt the report of the Preparatory Committee as the basis for discussion, a conflict arose again between the Soviet Union and the other countries. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov pointed out that the report had many shortcomings and applied to postpone the vote in order to present a complete disarmament resolution. Litvinov also said that the League of Nations had applied for a Sino-Japanese ceasefire. The Disarmament Conference mourns the bloodshed in the Far East, but arms are still being shipped from governments that are involved. This is a contradiction. If the war in the Far East were to use fistfights instead of shells and bombs that harm thousands of lives, then civilization could be spared great harm. Litvinov's proposed amendment for complete disarmament was then put to a vote, with only Russia and Turkey in favor. (25th Reuters telegram)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Note to the Envoys of the Four Powers</h3>
<p>Regarding the Japanese Army Using the Public Concession for Combat Operations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the incident of the Japanese army using the public concession for combat operations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the envoys (or chargés d'affaires) of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy in China on the evening of the 25th, stating that with regard to the report that the Chinese army had shelled various locations within the public concession, the consuls-general of your country stationed in Shanghai, together with the heads of other consulates, protested to the local authorities of our country. Although the Chinese government is truly regretful for the safety of the residents within the public concession and the danger they have suffered as a result, the minister must solemnly declare that our country is hardly responsible for this situation, regardless of whether the so-called shelling came from the Japanese side or our own side. The government of our country has repeatedly pointed out that the Japanese army completely disregards the special status of the public concession and uses it as a base of operations, allowing the army to land and carry out improper attacks on innocent civilians and troops of our country within the area under our country's jurisdiction. Since the government of our country has to resist this kind of aggression to safeguard national honor and lives, the responsibility for all the damage to the public concession caused by this resistance should be borne by the party that mainly uses the public concession as the starting point for its aggressive actions. This has already been notified by the authorities of our country to the countries concerned. The Chinese government now reports that in recent days, Japanese troops have arrived in Shanghai, and more reinforcements are being dispatched from Japan. The minister hereby requests your envoy (chargé d'affaires) to take the necessary steps immediately to prevent Japanese troops from landing in the public concession and using it as a base of operations for military action. The minister also requests your envoy (chargé d'affaires) to use the most effective methods to prevent the current state of the public concession from continuing to exist, as the bloody struggle near the public concession is causing it. The ardent hope is that the public concession authorities will no longer allow the Japanese army to continue to use the concession to commit crimes in violation of international law and humanity. Accordingly, this note is sent to your envoy (chargé d'affaires) for review and action. (25th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Government Decree Designates Funds for Domestic Debt</h3>
<p>Slightly Reducing Interest Rates and Extending the Repayment Period</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The National Government issued a decree on the 24th stating that since the Liaoning Incident, the prices of various bonds have plummeted, causing difficulties for the national finances and the social economy. The government has never been in arrears in repaying principal and paying interest. With the Shanghai Incident following, the market lost circulation and finance was paralyzed. The government and the people are one, with shared interests and common destiny. In this time of national crisis, with financial difficulties, it is better to slightly reduce interest rates and extend the repayment period than to allow the bond market to drift and the finance of society to be exhausted. The financial resources for resisting aggression can be slightly eased. The Ministry of Finance and various groups are ordered to discuss the matter in detail and re-propose appropriate standards based on the original regulations. It has been decided that 8.6 million yuan will be allocated monthly from the customs tax as a fund for managing various debts. The interest rate will be fixed at 6% per annum, and the repayment period will be handled according to the schedule proposed by the Ministry of Finance. The decree is to be issued by the Executive Yuan to the Ministry, which is to order the revenue officials and the chief tax inspector to allocate the principal and interest of various bonds in full each month until the principal and interest are cleared, without any delay. This is the final decision of the government and the people to maintain credit and regulate finance. Once the order is issued, it will be permanently fixed, and the aforementioned fund shall not be shaken in the future, and no changes shall be made to show great credit. This decree. (24th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This morning, major newspapers here carried reports that there were rumors that Song Ziwen had proposed issuing National Crisis Bonds for 100 million yuan, but inquiries from reliable sources said that this news was probably not reliable.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>A Report from the Provisional Capital</h3>
<p>Rural Towns with Simple Customs</p>
<p>Office Locations Narrow and Cramped</p>
<p>The central government, in order to avoid the enemy's armed pressure during the Japanese invasion of Shanghai and to freely exercise its functions, resolutely moved to Luoyang to conduct its business. The political center thus shifted from the east to the central province. The reporter went to visit the provisional capital, and the following are his observations along the way.</p>
<p>On the Jinpu Railway, military vehicles traveled back and forth frequently, but order was quite stable, and the local areas were peaceful and quiet. In the Shandong section, Liu Guitang, who accepted amnesty, divided and reorganized his bandits into smaller units. Most of them followed Liu in being incorporated into the army. The remaining small groups were suppressed by the army and hid in the mountains, not daring to be rampant and therefore not a cause for concern. The old troubles have completely disappeared, and the people are celebrating. Around 9 p.m. on the 17th, the reporter arrived in Xu. Since Wang Jingwei, Feng Huanzhang, and others were stationed in Xuzhou, the reporter stayed there briefly to conduct interviews.</p>
<p>The reporter visited Wang at 10 a.m. Wang was represented by Secretary-General Zeng Zhongming, who gave the following statement: "Premier Wang went to Nanjing last time to discuss military, diplomatic, and financial matters with ministers Ying Qin, Song Ziwen, and Luo Wengan. Concrete plans have already been made. The Military Affairs Commission is responsible for military affairs and has made full preparations to support the Shanghai war and has also made sufficient preparations for various regions. In terms of finance, Mr. Song Ziwen is in contact to raise funds. There are considerable methods in Nanjing to make every effort to reduce expenditures, and we can get through this difficult situation. Diplomacy is the most important issue today. Premier Wang's only insistence is to resist the Japanese military on one hand so that the Japanese army does not achieve its ambitions. On the other hand, we use diplomatic means to show that we abide by our faith and love peace in order to arouse international sympathy. The three ambassadors of Britain, the United States, and France contacted Minister Luo in Nanjing to mediate the Shanghai war and expressed sympathy for us, which shows that there is indeed a turning point in diplomacy. What the current government can announce to the people is that all parties have indeed united to face the national crisis together and are determined to deal with the difficult situation with an unyielding spirit. No matter how difficult the situation is, we will not sign treaties that lose power and humiliate the country in order to isolate ourselves from the people. I hope that the whole people will unite to support the government's spirit and save the country from danger. I hope that the press will provide vigorous publicity. Finally, he said that Wang will not leave Xu for the time being in order to facilitate the liaison between the two parties in Nanjing. Generalissimo Jiang Jieshi is inspecting the south and will return soon. Mr. Feng Huanwei is currently ill in Xu."</p>
<p>Observations from the Provisional Capital: The reporter boarded the Shanghai Special Express train westward at 8 a.m. on the 15th. The traffic along the way was heavy, and this kind of lively scene was definitely not normal. The scenery along the way was desolate and there was nothing to appreciate, so I felt quite lonely. Around 11 p.m., I arrived in Luoyang. It was difficult to find accommodation after getting off the train. I first went to Dajintai, but it was already full. Then I went to several cramped hotels, but there were no vacancies. So I returned to Dajintai and bargained with the accountant several times before finally getting a place. The city has been quiet for a long time, and once the capital was moved here and the political situation was initially settled, its staff and those seeking employment followed, and the few cramped hotels were naturally unable to meet the demand. Luoyang's streets are narrow, and the old-fashioned and small shops in the rural towns have no merchandise displays. The so-called "First Commercial Center" is the only place to visit in the city. There is a stage in the middle, which is currently not performing. On both sides are small shops selling groceries, which are actually larger stalls. However, the number of hooligans in the city has recently increased sharply due to the arrival of drivers brought by various important people. Because the roads are not wide, pedestrians and rickshaws stand aside when they hear the horn. The customs of the people are simple and honest. Men mostly wear blue or blue cloth, and women wear red and green clothes, which are quite ancient. The shop coolies generally expressed their happiness at the visit of the national government, as if the life of Luoyang would suddenly become prosperous. In fact, the move was only temporary, but the central personnel, who had been in the extravagant and luxurious Nanjing for a long time, suddenly felt something in this simple place.</p>
<p>Visiting Mr. Lin: At 9 a.m. on the 20th, I went to the Luoyang Library to visit Chairman Lin. Chief Staff Officer Lü was sent to represent him. We talked about the unanimous opinions of all parties regarding resisting aggression and saving the country. Zhang Xueliang's representative and Yang Aiyuan, representative of Shanxi, came to Xu and had very satisfactory results in their contact with the central personnel. Guangdong gave the Central Government active assistance in military and diplomatic affairs. Central committee members are scattered everywhere, and all can come to Luoyang immediately, but due to transportation relations or according to the Central Government's intentions, they were told to temporarily postpone their arrival, but their opinions are unanimous, and they will all do their best to save the country and resist aggression. The government is fully prepared militarily, diplomacy has made progress, and finance is also in order. It is determined to deal with the difficult situation with an unyielding spirit. Chairman Lin is stationed in the provisional capital, and the other gentlemen who are actually responsible for military and diplomatic affairs, such as Wang and Feng, travel back and forth on the Jinpu and Longhai Railways in order to give instructions nearby.</p>
<p>Locations of Government Offices: (1) Central Party Headquarters, National Government, located in the Heluo Library in the city. (2) Central Political Council, Executive Yuan, two offices for civil and military staff of the National Government, Ministry of Interior, and Ministry of Industry, located in the Third Vocational School.

<h3>Japanese Ambassador Forcibly Argues Regarding Ultimatum</h3>
<p>League of Nations Representatives Consider It Inadequate</p>
<p>The Tokyo Jiji Shimbun reports that Consul General Murai delivered an ultimatum to Mayor Wu at 9 p.m. on the 18th. Representatives of the League of Nations in Geneva were shocked and horrified when they heard the news, and all said that this kind of ultimatum was no different from what is called breaking off diplomatic relations in international law and sending an ultimatum to the plenipotentiary minister. Therefore, the representatives of various countries were greatly shocked. In order to avoid misunderstandings about the meaning of the word "ultimatum," our government (the Japanese government) specially instructed Representative Sato to vigorously argue that this ultimatum to the mayor of Shanghai was only issued by the consul and that the demand attached to Cai Tingkai by Ueda to withdraw the Chinese army was not from the Japanese government to the Chinese government, so it cannot be regarded as an act of international severance of relations stipulated in international law by one country to another. However, the representatives of the League of Nations considered this response to be inadequate.</p>
