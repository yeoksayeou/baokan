<p>時評</p>
<h3>租界應保持其中立性　彬</h3>
<p>上海惨變自上月二十八晚爆發以迄今日屈指已近一旬，此旬日。間吾人但日聞炮聲隆隆。機聲軋軋。但日見屍體狼藉遍地。難民擁擠於途。東亞第一之大巿塲已渝爲極可恐怖之塲麵所。凡屬關心遠東和平之人士。應都瞭然於此一惨變性質之嚴重。凡足以弭止此嚴重禍變之有效方法。應立即採取施行。同時更基於公理與正義之立塲上。對此一惨變作公道之判斷。</p>
<p>然而就事態之現狀而觀吾人對於負有維持租界治安責任。及可能維持和平重責之公共租界當局尚有數點。爲吾人所大惑不解者。敢提以質之公共租界當局。</p>
<p>第一。當惨變積極醖釀行將爆發之初。租界當局。分配防務。特劃蘇州河以北北江西路以東。東至楊樹浦沿淞滬鐵道線一帶。歸日本軍隊警備。夫泥城橋以北及楊樹浦一帶。原爲美租界於一八六三年與英租界合并。成立公共</p>
<p>租界。與日人固無與也。今劃此極易與我軍接觸衝突之地帶爲其警備區。不無予日人以軍事上便利之。嫌此吾人所不解者。一</p>
<p>第二。公共租界。固保有絶對的中立性質者也。自一八四三年成立以至目前。凡八十九年。中經中法之戰。清日之戰。與一九一四年至一九一八年之世</p>
<p>界大戰。公共租界及。上海港。都被公認爲絶對的中立。性不加侵犯。而此次日人竟不惜破壞其中立性。憑藉租界爲根据地。進以襲擊我軍。退以防守。城狐社鼠。有所恃而無畏。虹口一帶。概成戰區。同時日軍負責警備虹口一帶。其自身已成爲惨變之禍首。是否仍能負荷警備之責。亦已大明。乃租界當。局迄今尚未採取緊急有效之處置。以弭止禍變之擴大。此爲吾人所不解者二。</p>
<p>第三。虹口以至楊樹浦一帶租界内居民。對於租界當局。平時負有納税及其他種種義務。則租界當局。對於界内居民。應負有保障生命財產安全之義務。亦毫無可疑。今虹口一帶。已渝爲戰區。在日人暴行下。居民之生命財產。已毫無保障可言居民遭受無辜之屠戮而無可告訴似租界當局於其所應負荷之義務。尚未能盡。此爲吾人所不解者三。</p>
<p>總之。上海惨變。非單純之上海局部問題實即太平洋以至全世界之居問題。日人之横暴無信。藐視列國。勃勃野心。尤爲全世界人士所共見。据前日電訊。日駐美大使出淵謂美聯社代表曰。「野村海軍中將現赴上海。與美海軍總司令台納少將作球。戲兩領袖作球戲。時兩軍亦必作球戲也。」其趾高氣揚目中無人之神態。蓋活躍可掬。故全世界主張公道之人士。亟應起而共同制裁。而負有維持租界治安之當局。尤不可不恪守嚴格之中立者也。</p>

<h3>日機襲擊眞茹</h3>
<p>昨晨十一時、日飛機九架、在閘北擲彈後、即飛向眞</p>
<p>茹、圖炸國際無線電台、我軍即發高射砲及機關槍步槍射擊、一時炸彈槍砲聲並作、激戰至爲劇烈、</p>
<h3>空中作戰勝利</h3>
<p>當時我空軍六七兩隊聞警、亦趕到眞茹、與日機在天空作戰、我軍自始即佔優勢、時時居高臨下、以機關槍射擊、而高射砲瞄準復極準確、上下夾攻、日機漸覺不支、十一時三十分、日機一架、首被高射砲彈所中、機身着火、儲藏之炸彈爆裂、未幾即墜地粉碎、其餘兩架、亦被擊中、受傷後向南翔方面飛遁、旋即降落、据目睹者云、遁去之二日機、機尾已發青烟、一架墜地後即不起、另一架仍飛起逃逸、究竟如何、尚待證實、至其餘六架日機、狼狽遁走、我空軍追逐甚急、在虹橋道上、復有激戰、至下午一時許、我空軍始全勝言旋、</p>
<h3>日飛機師焚斃</h3>
<p>在眞茹擊落之日機、係打落在眞茹車站西南之楊家橋空地、該機在空中着彈後、即已焚焼、儲藏之炸彈亦復爆炸、聲如巨雷、落地、時機身已全部粉碎、日機師三人皆焚斃、腦漿流出、屍體幾已不能辨認、聞死者其一爲海軍大尉矢野讓五郎、當由英士在機内搜獲機師所帶之手槍三支、及焚壞之機關槍二架、機身甚大、祇顾骨、骼機頭有「三菱航空機株式會社修理昭和六年七月十八日」字樣、羣衆圍觀者數匝、多將機身之銀灰色撕下小塊、什　珍藏、謂以作抗日之紀念也、</p>

<h3>閘北我軍優勢</h3>
<p>日本陸軍參加作戰</p>
<p>分向我軍陣地進攻</p>
<p>我軍共分三路迎敵</p>
<p>擊退敵軍并獲戰品</p>
<p>昨日（五日）爲日兵下令總攻擊後之第三日、因前日（四日）日軍受我軍巨創、亟謀恢復、故昨日日兵方面、陸戰隊與陸軍全部動員、分向我軍各陣地進攻、我軍早已嚴陣以待、沉着應戰、發槍準確、且非待日軍衝入槍砲有效地點概不發槍、因此我軍均彈無虚發、日兵則槍砲亂發、一無戰鬥經騐、徒致損兵折將而尚欲屢屢派援、亦惟平添無數異鄕鬼魂而已、自昨晨五時至下午五時、亘十二小時有餘、日兵仍利用大砲飛機掩護、猛向我軍防地衝鋒、前後二十餘次、共發六百餘砲、均爲我軍擊退、始終未得進展寸土、反爲我軍右翼包圍、奪獲日軍鐵甲車三輛、一輛當塲炸毁、并獲機關槍四架、茲將昨日我軍分三路殲敵情、形分誌於次、</p>
<p>[PI&gt;昨日抵滬之我國空軍一部分隊員（李尊庸攝）</p>
<h3>邢家橋虬江路</h3>
<p>日兵前日在東寳興路曾被我軍一度包圍、後故昨日改變方向、出重兵以、攻在晨五時起、日兵即由奥迪安影戲院旁川弓路向邢家橋路偷襲、此處均係居民住宅、因我軍利於巷戰、日兵乃用大砲轟炸該房屋、同時用機關槍·迫擊砲·步槍、向我軍猛射衝鋒、我軍亦奮勇還擊、故日兵死亡相繼、我軍持戰約一小時、即漸向後詐敗、日兵以爲敗退、乃一擁而上、衝過廣東街、先前預伏在廣東街之我軍、即由兩旁衝出、將日兵全部包圍、一時彈如雨下、日兵戰鬥力全失、屍横枕藉、所有機槍四架、當被我軍截獲、同時北四川路形勢頓見緊張、日兵在北四川路以東一帶陣綫、有被壓迫搖動之勢、惟我軍爲自衛而抵抗、故不予追擊、仍守原防、</p>
<h3>天通庵江灣路</h3>
<p>該處日兵戰線甚長、一在青雲路、一在天通庵路、一沿淞滬路、總出發點在天通庵站、日兵主動力仍依砲隊及飛機鐵甲車、於昨晨八時許、向各路猛衝、而又以鄰近天通庵路寳興路處爲最烈、我軍鄧旅劉光營、向日兵防綫進出者數次、當日兵幾乎全部敗退時、日機在空中向我軍抛擲炸彈三次、均未轟炸、同時又用鐵甲車三輛、進攻我軍陣線、我軍中部士兵即向後移動、放其深入、待接近時、即抛擲手溜彈、並移動左右兩部、包抄其、後機關砲迫擊砲同時俱發、因此擊獲日兵鐵甲車二輛、被逃回一輛、我軍即時反攻、同時在青雲路八寺橋譚家弄北、日兵五六百名亦失利、被我軍包圍、至繕稿時、尚在被我軍圍擊中、我軍死傷二十餘人、日兵死亡甚衆、我方最前線、已進展至天通庵站左近、</p>
<h3>福生路新民路</h3>
<p>至十時許、日兵以兩處失、利乃調重兵側擊福生路新民路、及沿淞滬綫北一帶、仍憑臨高射下、用迫擊砲及鐵甲車二輛、由新民路猛向北車站進衝、我軍一在淞滬路寳山路車站及虬江路抵住日兵並用鋼砲·迫擊砲·機關轟擊掃射、一在寳山路北火車站路口新民路作戰、我軍士兵均用手溜彈·步槍·機關槍還擊、我後方砲隊、亦用大砲掩護我軍進展、日兵被我壓迫約一小時左右、即漸不支後退、鐵甲車二輛、尚圖衝散我軍陣綫當被我軍以炸彈將該車炸燬一輛、被逃逸一輛、斃敵五十餘名、我軍受傷三人、我軍陣綫、已逼近北四川、路至午後二時後、日兵已無攻意、祇日兵砲隊發砲轟擊閘北一帶、圖燬民房、自晨至晚、計發六百餘、砲</p>
<h3>日機又炸民房</h3>
<p>昨日聞日兵飛機在閘北一帶、投擲炸彈、自晨七時起至午後三時左右、不下百餘起、大半均落天通庵路以北、香山路公興路青雲路總計有四五處之多、濃烟密起、火舌隨之、祇見天空烟封冪冪、吹向西南、經過租界、如同日蝕、所焼灰燼、租界中區、均可得見、在空飛舞、因當時正在劇戰、以致延焼、刻正由警備司令部消防隊撲濊、</p>
<h3>我軍顾及租界</h3>
<p>大美晚報云、据西人以望遠鏡視察、見日飛機飛於閘北與公共租界天空者、其機下皆繫有炸彈、故華兵陣地高射砲不常發砲擊之、尤其在日飛機飛於租界天空之時、蓋恐飛機炸裂、殃及平民也、</p>
<h3>蔣蔡親臨前敵</h3>
<p>我軍總指揮蔣光鼎、軍長蔡廷楷、師長區籌年、昨日自晨至午、均親在前綫督戰、故我前綫將士、勇氣頓形倍增、無不以一當十、午後蔣蔡區三長官、並在各防綫視察防務、規劃一切、旋返司令部、</p>
<h3>雙方戰鬥能力</h3>
<p>据昨日前綫視察者言、昨晨日兵向我軍各路進攻時、意爲旣有重兵、定可一鼓而下、故衝鋒次數、爲列日來所未有、詎均爲我軍挫敗、且被我軍反攻、至上午十一時、幾全部崩潰、乃於十二時半急調生力軍分向各路應援、至下午一時半左右各路又有敗退之勢、正擬再調生力軍前往、但日兵已爲氣餒、鬥志全無乃亟令退守、故昨日午後二時後、日兵始終未敢進犯者、緣在於此、並云日兵衝鋒時、傴僂灣腰而進、一見我軍施射、即爲却步、我方士兵、則一聲令下、挺身捨命前衝、雖彈如雨下、未爲少怯、因此凡曾目睹之中外人士、無不佩嘆我軍將士之神勇、</p>
<h3>吳淞昨無戰事</h3>
<p>僅敵機六架擲彈</p>
<p>當即被我軍擊退</p>
<p>英美艦監視敵艦</p>
<p>三四兩日、日軍派軍艦十餘艘、轟擊我吳淞南北砲台、均被我軍痛擊敗退、但至昨日、吳淞方面、並不見敵軍艦來攻、僅派軍用飛機六架、希圖轟炸、當被我軍用高射砲擊退、隨後遂無動靜、故昨日吳淞方面、甚爲安靜、茲將敵軍飛機擲彈及其他各種情、形分記如下、</p>
<h3>敵機圖炸工廠</h3>
<p>吳淞方面、昨日並無正式戰事、吳淞南口外洋面、仍有敵艦踪跡發現、距砲臺火綫甚遠、要塞戒備嚴密異常、惟下午一時許、突有敵機六架、自滬飛出、至張華浜·京滬杭甬兩路工廠抛擲炸彈十餘枚、希圖轟毁該廠、幸所擲諸彈、均未命中、大都墜落糧米站碼頭前面鐵軌兩旁、絶無損害、有一彈落附近甘家橋馬姓草棚上未炸、復有一彈落鐵路煤棧、即行爆發、當將煤數十噸炸去、煤塊飛舞高空、幸該棧工人、迅速逃、避未受傷害、、另有一彈落南徐家灣田間炸一大坑、嗣經我防軍用高射砲及步槍射擊、敵機始向南逃去、、旋至下午四時許復有敵機二架、飛至吳淞偵察、並未擲彈、即行飛去、我軍因敵機飛行甚高、亦未擊射、</p>
<h3>吳淞口視察紀</h3>

During these days, we have only heard the booming of cannons and the rattling of engines. We have only seen corpses scattered all over the ground and refugees crowding the roads. The largest market in East Asia has been transformed into an extremely terrifying scene. All those who care about peace in the Far East should be fully aware of the seriousness of this tragic incident. All effective methods to stop this serious disaster should be adopted and implemented immediately. At the same time, based on the standpoint of public reason and justice, a fair judgment should be made on this tragic incident.</p>
<p>However, based on the current state of affairs, we have several points regarding the Public Concession authorities, who are responsible for maintaining the security of the concessions and who may bear the important responsibility of maintaining peace, that we find greatly puzzling. We dare to raise them to question the Public Concession authorities.</p>
<p>First. When the tragic incident was actively brewing and about to erupt, the Concession authorities, in allocating defense duties, specifically designated the area north of the Suzhou River, east of North Jiangxi Road, and east to the Yangshupu area along the Songhu Railway line, to be guarded by the Japanese army. The area north of the Mud City Bridge and the Yangshupu area were originally merged by the American Concession with the British Concession in 1863 to establish the Public</p>
<p>Concession. It has nothing to do with the Japanese. Now, designating this area, which is extremely prone to contact and conflict with our army, as its security zone is not without giving the Japanese military convenience. This is what we do not understand. One.</p>
<p>Second. The Public Concession inherently maintains absolute neutrality. Since its establishment in 1843 until now, 89 years have passed. It has gone through the Sino-French War, the Sino-Japanese War, and the World</p>
<p>War from 1914 to 1918. The Public Concession and the Port of Shanghai have both been recognized as absolutely neutral and inviolable. However, this time, the Japanese have disregarded its neutrality and used the Concession as a base to attack our army and retreat for defense. Like city foxes and shrine rats, they have something to rely on and are fearless. The Hongkou area has generally become a war zone. At the same time, the Japanese army is responsible for guarding the Hongkou area. The Japanese army itself has become the main culprit of this tragic incident. It is unclear if it can still shoulder the responsibility of guarding the area. The Concession authorities have not yet taken emergency and effective measures to stop the expansion of the disaster. This is what we do not understand. Two.</p>
<p>Third. Residents in the concession area from Hongkou to Yangshupu bear the obligations of paying taxes and various other obligations to the Concession authorities in normal times. Then, the Concession authorities should bear the obligation to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the residents in the area, which is also beyond doubt. Now, the Hongkou area has become a war zone. Under the brutality of the Japanese, the lives and property of the residents are no longer guaranteed. Residents are being slaughtered innocently without recourse. It seems that the Concession authorities have not fulfilled their obligations. This is what we do not understand. Three.</p>
<p>In summary. The Shanghai Incident is not simply a local issue in Shanghai, but a global issue concerning the Pacific Ocean and even the whole world. The Japanese are brutal, untrustworthy, and disregard other countries. Their ambitious desires are especially evident to people all over the world. According to a recent telegram, the Japanese ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, told the Associated Press representative: "Vice Admiral Nomura is now going to Shanghai to play golf with Rear Admiral Taussig, the commander of the U.S. Navy. When the two leaders play golf, the two armies will also play golf." His arrogant and supercilious attitude is indeed vivid. Therefore, people all over the world who uphold justice should rise up and impose joint sanctions. The authorities responsible for maintaining the security of the concession must strictly adhere to neutrality.</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Our Army's Progress on All Fronts Yesterday Was Smooth</h3>
<p>Our air force began operations yesterday and shot down three Japanese planes. The Japanese army participated in the battle in Zhabei yesterday. Our army captured three Japanese armored vehicles. Wusong was safe. There was a small battle in the southern city in the evening.</p>
<p>After the Japanese navy, army, and air force failed in two general offensives, the Wusong Fort area has been in a state of truce. Japanese warships have retreated far beyond the Sanjiashui area. Only Japanese planes went to Wusong twice to drop bombs, causing minor damage. The fighting in the Zhabei area was still very fierce yesterday. The Japanese army focused on attacking the central route of our army. Our army fought bravely and captured three enemy armored vehicles and four machine guns at Tiantong'an Road and Fusheng Road. Our army counterattacked successfully at Baoshan Road and Baoxing</p>
<p>Road, making new progress. Two detachments of our air force arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and engaged in aerial combat with Japanese planes in Zhenru, shooting down one enemy plane. All three Japanese pilots were burned to death. Last night at 9:00 PM, more than 40 Japanese soldiers dressed as civilians were discovered attempting to land and attack from Japanese warships, under the cover of machine gun fire. The police force bravely fought them off. Residents were greatly alarmed. The details of each situation are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Detailed Record of the Zhenru Air Battle</h3>
<p>Two Detachments of Our Air Force Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>First Operation Shoots Down Japanese Plane</p>
<p>Japanese planes have been bombing Zhenru and other places in Zhabei for days, destroying houses and injuring people, which is inhumane. At 10:00 AM yesterday, nine Japanese planes flew into the sky again, bombing everywhere in Zhabei and then flying over Zhenru, attempting to bomb the wireless telegraph station next to Zhenru Station and Jinan University, dropping several bombs that caused minor damage. Our air force arrived in time and engaged in aerial combat. At 11:30 AM, one Japanese plane was shot down and two were injured. They still struggled to fly and crashed near Nanxiang. The remaining planes were chased by our air force and fled quickly. The details are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Two Detachments of Planes Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday, the Sixth and Seventh Detachments of our air force, including several fighter planes and destroyers, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing and flew over the sky west of Shanghai for a week. It is said that more will arrive in the coming days. According to our air force personnel, our air force is acting entirely in legitimate self-defense and will not fly to the concessions for the time being. If Japanese planes come to the Chinese airspace to drop bombs, they will do their best to deal with them.</p>
<h3>Air Force Generals' Telegram</h3>
<p>To all newspapers and all sectors of the country, the Northeast Incident has been going on for months, and the lost territories of the three provinces have not been recovered. The tragic violence in Shanghai continues to unfold. Public reason has fallen and the world is indignant. Our air force carries the earnest hope of the people. The officers and soldiers embrace the shared hatred of the enemy and are determined to die for the country. They have been sharpening their swords and sleeping on their shields, not just for a day or two. They only hope that the government will bear the burden and seek peace, so that they have been enduring humiliation and procrastination, unable to die. Now, the airspace and territory are being wantonly devastated. The enemy's flames are spreading. The country will perish. Bingheng and others are responsible for air defense and swear to resist the strong. They are using assembly to seek self-defense. The sea may dry up and the rocks may rot, but this ambition will not change. May our people take note.

<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Zhenru</h3>
<p>At 11:00 AM yesterday, nine Japanese planes, after dropping bombs in Zhabei, flew towards Zhenru, attempting to bomb the International Wireless Telegraph Station. Our army immediately fired high-angle guns and machine guns. The sound of bombs and guns rang out at the same time, and the fierce battle was extremely intense.</p>
<h3>Victory in Aerial Combat</h3>
<p>At that time, the Sixth and Seventh Detachments of our air force heard the alarm and also rushed to Zhenru, engaging in aerial combat with Japanese planes in the sky. Our army had the upper hand from the beginning, always being in a superior position, shooting with machine guns, and the high-angle guns were extremely accurate in aiming. Attacking from above and below, the Japanese planes gradually felt overwhelmed. At 11:30 AM, one Japanese plane was first hit by a high-angle gun, the fuselage caught fire, and the stored bombs exploded. Not long after, it crashed to the ground and was shattered. The other two planes were also hit. After being injured, they fled towards Nanxiang and landed soon after. According to witnesses, the tails of the two Japanese planes that escaped were emitting green smoke. One plane crashed and did not take off again. The other plane still took off and escaped. What exactly happened remains to be verified. As for the remaining six Japanese planes, they fled in panic. Our air force pursued them urgently. There was another fierce battle on the Hongqiao Road. At about 1:00 PM, our air force returned in complete victory.</p>
<h3>Japanese Pilots Burned to Death</h3>
<p>The Japanese plane shot down in Zhenru crashed in the open space of Yangjia Bridge, southwest of Zhenru Station. After the plane was hit in the air, it was burned, and the stored bombs also exploded, making a sound like thunder. When it landed, the fuselage was completely shattered. All three Japanese pilots were burned to death, and their brains flowed out. The corpses were almost unrecognizable. It is said that one of the dead was Lieutenant Commander Yano Gogoro of the Navy. The British soldiers searched the plane and found three pistols carried by the pilot, as well as two burned machine guns. The fuselage was very large, only the bones remained. The head of the plane had the words "Mitsubishi Aircraft Co., Ltd. repaired on July 18, Showa 6." Crowds of people watched, many tearing off small pieces of the plane's silver-gray skin to treasure, saying that it was a souvenir of resisting Japan.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Our Losses</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, Japanese planes dropped a total of eight bombs in the Zhenru area. Seven bombs were dropped at Zhenru Station, three bombs landed in the open space east of the station, all more than ten feet deep, two bombs landed on the platform, and two bombs landed on the train. Station staff were not injured. One bomb landed on each of the left and right corners of the platform. The roof was bombed, and wooden planks and iron sheets flew several feet away. The glass windows on all four sides of the ticket office, staff room, waiting room, etc. were all shattered. The two bombs that fell on the train destroyed two carriages, resulting in few casualties. A total of five soldiers and four horses died in the fifth carriage, and six soldiers and three horses died in the sixth carriage. Three people died on the platform, one person died in front of the waiting room, and more than ten people were injured. In addition, a bomb was also dropped in front of Zhiyuan Hall at Jinan University, but fortunately it did not explode.</p>
<h3>Our Army Has the Upper Hand in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Participates in the Battle</p>
<p>Attacks Our Army's Positions</p>
<p>Our Army Is Divided Into Three Routes to Meet the Enemy</p>
<p>Repel the Enemy and Seize War Spoils</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th) was the third day after the Japanese soldiers ordered a general offensive. Because the Japanese army suffered a heavy blow from our army the day before (the 4th), they urgently sought to recover. Therefore, yesterday the Japanese soldiers mobilized all their marine corps and army, and attacked our army's positions in separate ways. Our army was already waiting in strict formation, responding calmly, firing accurately, and generally not firing until the Japanese army rushed into the effective range of guns. Therefore, our army fired every bullet, while the Japanese soldiers fired their guns and cannons indiscriminately, without any combat experience, only resulting in the loss of soldiers and generals, and still wanting to send reinforcements repeatedly, only adding countless foreign ghosts. From 5:00 AM to 5:00 PM yesterday, for more than twelve hours, the Japanese soldiers still used artillery and aircraft to cover, and stormed our army's defense line fiercely, more than twenty times before and after, firing more than six hundred cannons, all of which were repelled by our army. The Japanese soldiers ultimately did not make an inch of progress, but were surrounded by our army's right wing, and three Japanese armored vehicles were seized, one of which was blown up on the spot, and four machine guns were seized. The following is a record of our army's three-way annihilation of the enemy.</p>
<p>[PI&gt;Some of the members of our air force who arrived in Shanghai yesterday (Photo by Li Zunyong)</p>
<h3>Xingjia Bridge, Qiujiang Road</h3>
<p>The Japanese soldiers were once surrounded by our army in Dongbaoxing Road the day before, so they changed direction yesterday and sent heavy troops to attack. From 5:00 AM, the Japanese soldiers sneaked into Xingjia Bridge Road from Chuangong Road next to the Odeon Theater. These are all residential houses. Because our army is good at street fighting, the Japanese soldiers used artillery to bomb the houses, and at the same time used machine guns, mortars, and rifles to shoot at our army fiercely. Our army also fought back bravely, so Japanese soldiers died one after another. Our army held the battle for about an hour, and then gradually retreated in a feigned defeat. The Japanese soldiers thought they had retreated, so they rushed up and crossed Guangdong Street. The Chinese soldiers who had been ambushed in Guangdong Street rushed out from both sides and surrounded all the Japanese soldiers. For a time, bullets rained down, and the Japanese soldiers completely lost their combat power, and the corpses were lying all over the place. All four machine guns were intercepted by our army. At the same time, the situation on North Sichuan Road suddenly became tense. The Japanese soldiers' front line in the area east of North Sichuan Road was under pressure and shaking. However, our army resisted for self-defense, so it did not pursue and still defended the original position.</p>
<h3>Tiantong'an, Jiangwan Road</h3>
<p>The Japanese soldiers' front line in this area was very long, one in Qingyun Road, one in Tiantong'an Road, and one along Songhu Road. The general starting point was Tiantong'an Station. The main force of the Japanese soldiers still relied on artillery teams, aircraft, and armored vehicles. At about 8:00 AM yesterday, they launched fierce attacks on all routes, with the area near Tiantong'an Road and Baoxing Road being the fiercest. Deng Brigade and Liu Guangying of our army advanced and retreated several times to the Japanese soldiers' defense line. When the Japanese soldiers were almost completely defeated, Japanese planes dropped bombs on our army in the air three times, but none of them exploded. At the same time, three armored vehicles attacked our army's front line. The soldiers in the middle of our army moved backward, letting them penetrate deep. When they approached, they threw hand grenades and moved the left and right sides to encircle them from behind. Machine guns and mortars fired at the same time, so two Japanese armored vehicles were captured and one was escaped back. Our army immediately counterattacked. At the same time, 500 to 600 Japanese soldiers in Qingyun Road, Basi Bridge, Tanjiagang North were also defeated and surrounded by our army. At the time of writing, they were still being attacked by our army. More than 20 people from our army were killed or injured, and many Japanese soldiers were killed. The front line of our side has advanced to near Tiantong'an Station.</p>
<h3>Fusheng Road, Xinmin Road</h3>
<p>At about 10:00 AM, the Japanese soldiers, because of the losses in the two places, transferred heavy troops to flank Fusheng Road, Xinmin Road, and the north of Songhu Line. Still relying on the high ground, they used mortars and two armored vehicles to rush towards the North Station fiercely from Xinmin Road. One part of our army resisted the Japanese soldiers at Songhu Road, Baoshan Road Station, and Qiujiang Road, and used steel cannons, mortars, and machine guns to bombard and sweep. Another part fought at Baoshan Road, the North Railway Station intersection, and Xinmin Road. Our soldiers used hand grenades, rifles, and machine guns to counterattack. Our rear artillery team also used artillery to cover our army's advance. The Japanese soldiers were suppressed by us for about an hour, and then gradually retreated. Two armored vehicles were still trying to break up our army's front line. Our army used bombs to blow up one of the vehicles, and one escaped. More than 50 enemy soldiers were killed, and three soldiers from our army were injured. Our army's front line has approached North Sichuan Road. After 2:00 PM, the Japanese soldiers had no intention to attack. Only the Japanese artillery team fired cannons to bombard Zhabei, trying to destroy civilian houses. From morning to night, more than 600 cannons were fired.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Civilian Houses Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that Japanese soldiers' planes dropped bombs in the Zhabei area. From 7:00 AM to about 3:00 PM, there were no less than a hundred incidents. Most of them fell north of Tiantong'an Road, Xiangshan Road, Gongxing Road, and Qingyun Road, totaling four or five places. Thick smoke rose, followed by flames. Only the sky was seen covered with smoke, blowing to the southwest, passing through the concession, like a solar eclipse. The ashes burned can be seen flying in the central area of the concession. Because there was a fierce battle at the time, the fire spread. It is currently being extinguished by the fire brigade of the garrison headquarters.</p>
<h3>Our Army Takes the Concession Into Consideration</h3>
<p>The Great American Evening News said that according to Westerners' observation with telescopes, the Japanese planes flying in the sky over Zhabei and the Public Concession all had bombs tied under them. Therefore, the high-angle guns of the Chinese soldiers' positions do not often fire cannons to attack them, especially when the Japanese planes are flying in the sky over the concession, fearing that the planes will explode and cause harm to civilians.</p>
<h3>Jiang and Cai Personally Go to the Front Line</h3>
<p>Jiang Guangding, the commander-in-chief of our army, Cai Tingkai, the army commander, and Qu Chounian, the division commander, all personally supervised the battle on the front line from morning to noon yesterday, so the courage of our front-line soldiers was greatly increased, and everyone was able to fight against ten enemies. In the afternoon, Jiang, Cai, and Qu, the three senior officers, inspected the defense in each defense line, planned everything, and returned to the headquarters.</p>
<h3>Combat Capabilities of Both Sides</h3>
<p>According to observers on the front line yesterday, when the Japanese soldiers attacked our army's positions yesterday morning, they thought that with heavy troops, they would be able to take it down in one go. Therefore, the number of attacks was unprecedented in recent days, but they were all defeated by our army and counterattacked by our army. By 11:00 AM, they had almost completely collapsed, so at 12:30 PM, they urgently transferred reinforcements to support each route. By about 1:30 PM in the afternoon, each route was about to retreat again. They were planning to transfer reinforcements again, but the Japanese soldiers were already discouraged and had no fighting spirit, so they ordered them to retreat. Therefore, the reason why the Japanese soldiers did not dare to attack after 2:00 PM yesterday was because of this. It was also said that when the Japanese soldiers charged, they leaned over and advanced. As soon as they saw our army firing, they stepped back. The soldiers on our side, at a command, stepped forward and charged desperately. Even though bullets were raining down, they were not afraid at all. Therefore, everyone who has witnessed it, both Chinese and foreigners, has been admiring the bravery of our army's officers and soldiers.</p>
<h3>No Fighting in Wusong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Only Six Enemy Planes Drop Bombs</p>
<p>Were Immediately Repelled by Our Army</p>
<p>British and American Warships Monitor Enemy Warships</p>
<p>On the 3rd and 4th, the Japanese army sent more than ten warships to bombard our Wusong North and South Forts, and they were all fiercely defeated and retreated by our army. But until yesterday, no enemy warships were seen attacking in the Wusong area. Only six military planes were sent, hoping to bomb them. They were repelled by our army's high-angle guns. Then there was no movement. Therefore, yesterday the Wusong area was very quiet. The following is a record of the enemy planes dropping bombs and other various situations.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Try to Bomb Factories</h3>
<p>There were no official battles in the Wusong area yesterday. Traces of enemy warships were still found outside the Wusong South Estuary, far away from the fire line of the fort. The fortress was heavily guarded. However, at about 1:00 PM, six enemy planes suddenly flew out of Shanghai and threw more than ten bombs at the factories in Zhanghuabang, the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, hoping to destroy the factories. Fortunately, the bombs thrown did not hit the target. Most of them fell on both sides of the railway tracks in front of the grain and rice station wharf, with no damage at all. One bomb fell on the thatched shed of a Mr. Ma near Ganjiabao and did not explode. Another bomb fell on the railway coal yard and exploded, blowing away dozens of tons of coal. The coal flew into the high sky. Fortunately, the workers in the yard quickly escaped and avoided injury. Another bomb fell on the field in Nansujiawan and blasted a large pit. Later, our defense army used high-angle guns and rifles to shoot at them. The enemy planes fled to the south. Then, at about 4:00 PM, two enemy planes flew to Wusong for reconnaissance. They did not drop bombs and flew away. Our army did not shoot at them because the enemy planes were flying very high.</p>
<h3>Record of Inspection of Wusong Estuary</h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency went to the Wusong area yesterday morning and saw that the defense there was still very solid. After the Japanese destroyers were defeated and retreated the day before, the 30th Kaisara I (transliteration) and the 15th Shushuji were all docked at the Osaka Wharf and the Huangpu Wharf. A cruiser was docked at the Huishan Wharf. The 7th Wuzhuji destroyer was docked opposite the West Ferry of Yangshupu. Another cruiser was docked at the Huangpu Wharf. Except for the Japanese aircraft carrier anchored at Chuansha Bailonggang, no cruisers or destroyers were seen at the Wusong Estuary. However, at 12:15 noon, six Japanese planes, except for two planes patrolling Pudong, the other three planes attacked the Wusong Estuary and dropped three bombs. Our army fired cannons and repelled them. At 12:40 PM, no trace of enemy planes was seen. But at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, another plane came for reconnaissance and left without any action. The coast of our army is very heavily guarded. Anyone who lands will be shot.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Being Monitored</h3>
<p>The Japanese warships that attacked the Wusong Fort and failed retreated to Sanjiashui and stopped there. They still intended to continue the attack. The naval vessels of the British, American, and French embassies stationed at Pukou had dispatched several ships to outside the Wusong Estuary in the afternoon of the day before and the morning of yesterday, stopping inside Sanjiashui to isolate the Japanese warships, making it impossible for them to attack Wusong again. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, only nine Japanese planes came to Wusong to drop bombs, hoping to disturb them.</p>
<h3>Guanghua Oil Storage Intact</h3>
<p>At about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the reporter took a small steamer to Wusong. When the boat approached Zhanghuabang, it saw eight enemy planes dropping bombs in the air above the North and South Platforms of Wusong, making a loud noise. The town of Zhanghuabang was also affected. The small steamer returned immediately. Also, the Guanghua Oil Storage, which was previously reported to have been burned, was actually not true.</p>
<h3>Details of House Destruction</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, enemy warships attacked the fort twice, and the artillery fire was quite fierce. The civilian houses in the Pai-T'ai-wan area and the Outer Main Road along the Pu of Wusong East Town were all destroyed by artillery. Yesterday, the reporter went to various places to investigate. The houses of Pai-T'ai-wan Radio Station, Seaside Hotel Sanatorium, Merchant Marine School, Fisheries School, and China Public School were all attacked by artillery, causing great damage. The houses destroyed by artillery fire on the Outer Main Road along the Pu of Wusong East Town, from the Life Saving Bureau Wharf to the Mingyuan Building, were everywhere. The broken walls and ruins were shocking to see, showing the fierceness of the artillery fire at that time. The Yong'an Yarn Factory and Flower Clothes Yard in Yunzaobang were also bombed and burned at 4:00 PM the day before. The factory's fire brigade did its best to extinguish the fire, and the rest of the buildings were preserved. Also, the roof of the Hua Feng Yarn Factory's office building was also bombed away at the same time. In addition, the Wusong branch of the Guanghua Oil Company was also bombed and destroyed (the oil storage of the company was mistakenly reported yesterday), Songxing Road is the center of the entire town of Wusong, and many houses have also been destroyed. In total, the losses are quite heavy.</p>
<h3>Submarine Cable Interrupted</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News said that as a result of the Japanese warships bombarding the Wusong Fort yesterday (the 4th), three submarine cables were broken. Yesterday morning, only the Great Northern Telegraph Company was able to send telegrams as usual. The cables of the Pacific Business Telegraph Company and the Great Eastern Company were broken, but it was impossible to find out whether they were intentionally cut off or damaged during the war. The submarine cable between Shanghai and Nagasaki was also interrupted in Wusong.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Attempts to Attack Southern City</h3>
<p>Was Repelled by Our Police</p>
<p>At 8:45 yesterday afternoon, in the river area of the Datong Wharf at the 16th Pier in the Southern City, a small gasoline boat carrying more than 40 Japanese soldiers dressed as civilians was suddenly discovered next to the small steamers and barges originally docked there, preparing to land, intending to attack the Southern City. It was seen by the security team of the 1st District Public Security Bureau, who immediately opened fire. At the same time, the Japanese warships anchored nearby also opened a machine gun to cover the civilians landing. The police team made every effort to shoot and repelled the civilians and the small steamboat. Special martial law was immediately declared.</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi's Talk</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Incident is the Whole Problem in Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>The National Government appointed Deputy Foreign Minister Deng Taiqi to Shanghai to be responsible for handling diplomatic issues because the Japanese army attacked our army's defense zone in Shanghai based on the concessions. The reporter of this newspaper visited Deputy Minister Guo yesterday and asked about the government's policy towards Japan. Guo said that Japan regards the Shanghai Incident as a local issue, but we regard the Shanghai issue as the whole problem in Sino-Japanese relations. We will proceed according to the five points of the peaceful solution proposed by the four countries of the United States, Britain, France, and Italy. I will be stationed in Shanghai temporarily and wait for development.</p>
<h3>News from Various Sources</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a Japanese military transport ship docked at the Huishan Wharf and unloaded thirteen steel cannons and over three hundred boxes of military supplies. After landing, they were immediately loaded onto numerous trucks and driven directly to the Japanese Marines headquarters. Simultaneously, approximately six hundred marines landed.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops originally stationed in the Caojiadu area of western Shanghai began moving to the Hongkou area around 7:30 yesterday morning. There are no longer any Japanese troops in western Shanghai.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, two teams of Japanese Marines have been stationed at the Donghua and Dakang yarn factories in Yinxiang Township, eastern Shanghai. Around 3:00 PM yesterday, they all withdrew.</p>
<p>On the Pudong side, Japanese planes flew from the Donghai beach area of Chuansha towards Shanghai, some heading directly towards Yangshupu, others flying west towards the Nanshi area and then turning north. Starting at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, they flew from southeast to northwest, two at a time. Observers say that these planes do not seem to be scouting the situation, but rather transporting explosive munitions, as there is indeed a Japanese aircraft carrier anchored offshore of Chuansha.</p>
<p>The 大陆报 (Dalu Bao) reports that last night (the 4th), it was confirmed by official sources that a Japanese junior officer with the rank of lieutenant committed suicide. However, the headquarters of the Japanese command would not release his name or unit. After being ravaged by the Japanese army, Zhabei suffered heavy losses. Yesterday,</p>
<p>the Guangdong Primary and Secondary School near Guangdong Road in the district was also damaged by the Japanese army. All the teachers and staff there have fled. Furthermore, a female student named Huang Xi, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, is missing. Huang is a boarder at the school and resides at 18 Peifu Lane, Huanghe Road, French Concession. Her family is currently searching for her.</p>
<p>Due to repeated defeats in battle, the Japanese Naval Ministry has ordered Vice Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura to succeed Shiozawa. Nomura has already arrived in Shanghai and yesterday went to the Hongkou area to inspect the Japanese troops.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Incident Investigation Team's News</h3>
<p>Report Transmitted to Geneva by Cable</p>
<p>It has been learned that Italian Consul General Ciano, Earl of Ciano, has delivered a note from the Italian government to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The note strongly supports the proposals of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France regarding the Shanghai Incident. According to Ciano, Italy fully agrees with the proposals to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the report of the International League of Nations investigation team on the Shanghai Incident was transmitted to Geneva by cable last night (the 5th). It is reported that it expresses deep dissatisfaction with the actions of the Japanese army and contains many critical remarks. The investigation team is led by Italian Consul General Ciano.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Talks About the Trip to Hong Kong and Guangdong</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Youren arrived in Shanghai at noon on the 5th aboard the 大来公司 (Da Lai Company) steamer, the President McKinley, from Hong Kong. Accompanying him were Central Committee member Wang Luyi and Secretary Liu Kaihui. They provided the following account of the trip:</p>
<p>"This time, I was ordered by the Central Government to go to Hong Kong and Guangdong to explain the situation of the Central Government and to express the ardent hope that comrades in the South would join in overcoming the national crisis. I met with Mr. Hu Hanmin three times in Hong Kong. Mr. Hu's spirit has improved and he indicated that he would be able to come north soon. In Guangzhou, I met with the Central Committee comrades and generals in Guangdong, and the situation was very good. They absolutely support the Central Government without any reservations.</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>After the Shanghai Incident occurred, the generals were particularly indignant. When I was in Hong Kong, I telegraphed all parties, saying that the national affairs are now extremely difficult, and only if the elders and generals immediately make a clear and consistent expression, strengthen the government's determination to resist aggression, and enable the whole country to</p>
<p>unite and work together to save the country from danger. Soon, I received replies from Mr. Tang Shaochuan, Chen Jitang, Bai Chongxi, and other comrades, expressing their very strong feelings. I reported this situation to the Central Government. I went to Zhongshan County to visit Mr. Tang Shaochuan in Tangjiawan. Tang Guangsheng still showed the same heartfelt concern for the Central Government. When I was in Zhongshan, I did not yet know about the Shanghai Incident. After learning about the Shanghai Incident, Mr. Tang sent a telegram that was particularly concerned about saving the country. I just returned to Shanghai and everything is still unclear. Because I was very anxious when I was in Hong Kong, I returned in a hurry. As for my opinions on the current situation, as well as my actions, they still depend on various inquiries, so I cannot tell you at this time. However, it is natural for me to report back to the Central Government first. Also, when the war in Shanghai started, the people of Guangdong and Hong Kong were all inspired, expressing their great wishes for the glorious victory of the 19th Route Army, and also their great hopes for the officers and soldiers fighting on the front lines to work hard for the country. I earnestly hope that our comrades on the front lines will unite and work together to save the country and the nation from danger."</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Issues Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Explaining the Situation of the 19th Route Army</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan, came to Shanghai yesterday and issued a statement saying, "There seems to be much misunderstanding in Shanghai's public opinion regarding the Central Government's support of the 19th Route Army. People from all walks of life suspect that the government has not provided sufficient supplies and ammunition to the loyal and courageous 19th Army comrades who are defending the country. I am certain that the 19th Army has sufficient ammunition. As for military expenses, since I resumed my position as head of finance, there has been adequate support. As for the dispatch of reinforcements, the information I know is as follows: At the government meeting last Friday, Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, Garrison Commander of Songhu, and former Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army Chen Mingshu, former Commander-in-Chief Jiang Jieshi, former Commander-in-Chief of the National Army Feng Yuxiang, and former Commander of the 4th Army Li Jishen all said that the Japanese bombing of Shanghai is only part of Japan's plan to subvert our country's grand scheme. Our country should be fully prepared for self-defense and strongly advocated moving the capital to Luoyang. When the troop strength of the 19th Army was discussed, Mr. Chen Mingshu said that there was no need for reinforcements in the coming weeks, and that the current troop strength could support it. There is also one thing to tell the people of the country. When the meeting was held at the Lizhi Society in Nanjing at 4:00 PM on Tuesday of this week, all the generals and officers of the troops guarding the capital firmly requested Minister He Yingqin and Garrison Commander of Songhu Chen Mingshu to send them to Shanghai to assist the 19th Army in combat. Mr. Chen told them that only a few battalions were currently joining the front line, and there was no need for assistance. Military officers who acted freely without the orders of the Minister of Military Affairs, even though they were motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, would be subject to punishment for disobedience. However, the generals and soldiers' determination to share the defense of Shanghai was extremely firm. Mr. Chen finally gave a long reply, saying that comrades in each army could be transferred to assist when necessary. However, based on the current situation, each army should adhere to the overall plan of national defense, hold their original defenses, and await orders. At this time of national crisis, the entire population should be united as a backing for the government. Each person may have their own plans to save the country, but it should be known that a unified plan is superior to countless contradictory and conflicting plans, which are equivalent to having no plan at all."</p>

The innocent civilians have suffered enormous losses in lives and property, which is plain for all to see. We earnestly hope that you will show human compassion, uphold justice, and await your orders with the utmost urgency.

Not only have they occupied Liaoning and Jilin, attacked the Heilongjiang Province, oppressed Tianjin and Fuzhou, and disturbed Fujian and Xiamen, but their wolfish ambitions have become increasingly arrogant. Now they are attacking Shanghai, invading the capital, slaughtering our people, and destroying our essence, with increasing ferocity and rampage. Our 19th Route Army is fulfilling its duty to defend the country and territory, vowing to resist to the death, one falling after another, and winning repeated victories. However, the isolated army is fighting a bloody battle and urgently needs assistance. We beg the government to quickly dispatch troops to Shanghai to help overcome the crisis. If they remain indifferent and sit idly by, then if Shanghai is lost, the whole country will be shaken. How will the governing officials apologize to the country? At this critical moment of survival, all our comrades should rise up to support the 19th Route Army. In particular, Whampoa alumni who command troops should assist Shanghai without waiting for orders from their superiors, and those without positions should organize volunteer armies to fight the Japanese寇 (kou) to the death. They have weapons, but we have hot blood. With one heart and one mind, we vow to coexist with the 19th Route Army and the citizens of Shanghai. This urgent telegram is respectfully presented, and we await your response with the utmost anticipation. The National Salvation Association of the Chinese Kuomintang Whampoa Alumni, Cao Xiaoqing, Luo Beihai, Cao Qinyu, Jia Yi, Feng Pingxia, Yang Yuchun, Jiang Kang, Wang Xiaoyun, Wang Zhichao, Chen Gongquan, Zhang Chao, Wu Zizhen, Chen Gongshu, Duan Hao, Li Hongxiang, Li [omitted], Wang Wujin, Lian Zhongshan, Niu Jiesan, Qi Qingbin, Wang Shenzhi, Zhang Kexing, Jia Daren, Chen Jie, Li Su, Li Qizhong, Yu Jingfang, Wu Shengzu, Wang Zhitie, Shang Gufeng, Lei Qingchen, Hu Changyuan, Yu Qi, Han Jiwen, Zhou Sidi, Zhang Siyin, Tang Yongxian, Zhang Yongli, Wu Hengshan, Mou Xiang, Jiang Tian, Zhou Ruilong, Wu Jigao, Sun Cheng, Wang Meisheng, Xie Lisheng, Qin Dunren, Peng [omitted], Chen Zhenya, Xiong Yusi, Lü Jin Yuan, Wen Wangzhou, Long Fabai, Liu Xianjue, etc., 1,235 people respectfully bow."</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions: The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the National Government, stating (titles omitted): "Since the 19th Route Army first raised the banner of resistance, it has repeatedly won great victories, and the morale of the military and civilians has been high. The policy of non-resistance, which our country has followed, has been unanimously awakened from top to bottom and is no longer reliable. Moreover, we deeply believe that timely and proper self-defense is not only for the sake of China's future but also for the benefit of all humanity and is an urgent and unavoidable obligation. Therefore, we swear to solemnly telegraph and implore your government to make a decisive decision, immediately issue an order to all the soldiers and officers of the country to be ready to defend the country at any moment, and order the navy, army, and air force to come to Shanghai to reinforce, so as to achieve the full success of annihilating the enemy. This telegram is sent with tears, and our desires cannot be fully expressed. We only ask for a prompt solution."</p>
<p>The Municipal Citizens' United Association: The Shanghai Special District Citizens' United Association telegraphed the National Government yesterday, stating, "To Chairman Lin of the Luoyang National Government and all members: This time, the Japanese寇 (kou) invaded Shanghai, and our 19th Route Army bravely killed the enemy, bringing glory to our nation. The righteous voice has spread and the whole country is moved. However, the isolated army has been fighting a bloody battle for a week, and we have not heard that our government has sent a single soldier or a single bullet to assist. The three million citizens of Shanghai are filled with fear and cannot fathom the depth of the situation. This time, the 19th Route Army vowed to resist Japan to the death, which is not a local issue in Shanghai but is related to the safety of the whole country. If your government does not abandon the people, it should quickly send real assistance to secure the foundation of the country and reassure the people. We cannot but crane our necks and await orders. The Shanghai Special District Citizens' United Association respectfully bows 微 (Wei)."</p>
<p>The Architectural Association: The Municipal Architectural Association telegraphed the National Government, stating, "The country is in danger! To Chairman Lin of the Luoyang National Government, Director Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Member Jiang of the National Government: The Japanese寇 (kou) invaded Shanghai, and the gods and men are filled with indignation. If it falls, the local area will inevitably be devastated. The safety is related to the survival of the country. We beg you to make a decisive decision immediately, quickly dispatch strong troops to assist in the battle, and urge Member Jiang to come to Shanghai to supervise the army and annihilate the remaining enemies as soon as possible. We vow to use our hot blood as the government's backing. This urgent telegram is respectfully presented, and we hope that you will consider it carefully. The Shanghai Municipal Architectural Association respectfully bows 微 (Wei)."</p>
<h3>National Salvation Association Requests All Armies to Voluntarily Assist Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Salvation Association issued a circular telegram, stating: "To all commanders-in-chief, commanders, army commanders, division commanders, and brigade commanders of the national navy, army, and air force: Since the Shenyang Incident, the atrocities committed by the Japanese寇 (kou) against us have been extreme in every way. They are assessing our eastern provinces, spying on our hot zones, oppressing Tianjin and Beijing, and disturbing Fuzhou and Xiamen. The various tragedies are outrageous. Now they are taking it a step further, attacking Shanghai, threatening the capital. Our 19th Route Army, holding the determination to defend the territory, is resisting for the sake of righteousness. They have been fighting bloody battles for several days, winning repeatedly. We are delighted by the frequent reports of victory. However, the Japanese寇 (kou) are successively sending reinforcements to Shanghai, exerting all their strength, hoping to destroy our 19th Route Army, which is protecting the country and defending the people. Our government has not yet provided any supplies or reinforcements. The healthy sons who are resisting Japan and saving the country will inevitably be sacrificed, and the financial center of Shanghai will be lost, followed by the disaster of national extinction. Our association is indignant at the rising flames of the Japanese and pained at the imminent demise of the country. Therefore, based on the meaning of saving the country, we dare to ask all our compatriots in the national navy, army, and air force to embrace the common determination of hating the enemy, the desire to defend the country and save the people, and to rise up in unity, voluntarily go to Shanghai to assist and reinforce, so as to strengthen the anti-Japanese strength and fight the Japanese 寇 (kou) to the death. The survival of the country depends on this one action. Time is pressing, and we hope you will quickly act. The Chinese National Salvation Association bows 冬 (Dong)."</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Drop Bombs Everywhere</h3>
<p>Many Dead and Injured in the British and French Concessions</p>
<p>Repeated Protests Treated as Nothing</p>
<p>Yesterday, Bombs Were Again Dropped in the Concessions At noon yesterday, 12:00, a bomb suddenly dropped by a Japanese plane on the Yang family's residence at 1164 Siwen Lane, Xinzha Road. The bomb penetrated the roof and landed in the small room on the roof, immediately exploding. At that time, Wang Yang, a Ningbo native, was residing in that small room, having lunch around the table with his eldest son Jin Yong (15 years old), his second son Genbao (12 years old), and his niece Qin Yujing (26 years old). The bomb landed squarely on Jin Yong's back. All four were seriously injured. Genbao's left foot was blown off (from the knee up). Jin Yong's right leg was also wounded by the explosion, and blood and flesh were blurred, rendering him unable to move. Wang Yang was wounded in the head, with relatively minor injuries. Qin Yujing's right hand had two fingers blown off. The property damage inside the house was also considerable, including the destruction of a square table and the shattering of three glass windows. After the incident, four detectives from the Xinzha Road Police Station were dispatched to first send the injured to the Red Cross Hospital on Xinzha Road for treatment and to bring the exploded bomb back to the police station for filing and investigation. It is also heard that the authorities of the concession, given the recent frequent bombing by Japanese planes, which has affected the concessions and greatly disrupted the security and order within the concessions, will once again make a serious representation to the Japanese side to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again, in order to protect the lives and property of residents within the concessions.</p>
<p>Japanese Plane Bombs Tongren Hospital Yesterday afternoon,</p>
<p>a bomb was dropped by a Japanese plane at the intersection of Xihua Road and Peng Road, attempting to bomb Tongren Hospital. The large glass windows of the hospital's writing room were damaged, and the buildings of the Jishengtang Pharmacy, a Japanese merchant across the street, were also affected. A Japanese man passing by the area was killed instantly, his flesh and blood blurred.</p>
<p>Machine Guns Strafe Downward Yesterday (the 5th) at approximately 11:10 AM, two Japanese aircraft circled in the sky over Caojiadu and Fanhangdu in western Shanghai. When they flew over the town of Caojiadu, they frequently strafed downward with machine guns. The roof of the Tianhetang Pharmacy in the town was hit by one bullet, which penetrated into the bedroom of a shop assistant upstairs. The bullet hit the top of the mosquito net and bedding, immediately igniting a fire. Fortunately, the shop assistants worked hard to extinguish it. Afterward, a bullet was found under the bed. It was about two and a half inches long and half an inch in diameter, resembling a toy whistle bullet that ignites upon impact, which is also rare.</p>
<p>A Bomb Injures Three People At Heifeng Lane, Roberts Road, western Shanghai, at approximately 2:00 PM yesterday, a bomb dropped by a Japanese plane injured three people, who were immediately sent to the hospital.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ruffians Harass Chinese Concessions</h3>
<p>Using All Kinds of Tricks, Doing All Kinds of Evil</p>
<p>Extra Caution When Staying at Home and Going Out</p>
<p>Throwing Bombs from Cars Yesterday afternoon at 12:15, a car in the French Concession, Bund, heading north from the south, was driven very fast by what appeared to be two Japanese people. When passing in front of number 43, they dropped a bomb and sped away northward. The names of the dead and injured are as follows: (1) Jiang Xiexing, 26 years old, injured in the throat and left intestine, sent to Renji Hospital and died of serious injuries at 3:35 PM, later sent to the coroner's office; (2) Pan Asan, 41 years old, from Wuxi, unemployed, living at 5 Ruiqing Lane, Nancang Street, injured in both feet; (3) Wu Ayin, 20 years old, from Hubei, dock worker, injured in the left hand; (4) Tang Linbao, from Baoshan, 26 years old, noodle maker, living at 167 Ruiqing Lane, Jiaxing Road, injured in both feet.</p>
<p>Robbing a Maid of Her Belongings Lu Tong, a woman from Changshu, 30 years old, has been working as a maid for the Wang family from Hangzhou near the Sanjiao Small Vegetable Market in Hongkou for nearly two months. The owner gave her 25 yuan in banknotes and told her to flee. She was suddenly encountered by Japanese soldiers and nearly shot. Then, the Japanese soldiers searched the banknotes from inside her clothes and seized them all before releasing her, sending her to the Public Concession at the Waibaidu Bridge. She cried bitterly on the way. She was sent to the reception center of the Guangrentang Shelter on North Chengdu Road by service personnel.</p>
<p>Injuring People in Yongyu Lane Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, a Japanese ruffian mixed into the fifth alley entrance of Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road, in the French Concession, secretly threw a bomb, which suddenly exploded. At that time, Yao Yuanding, a Jiangsu native who lived at number 48 in the lane and currently works at the local court, was passing by the area and injured his foot. He immediately sought treatment at the Huilv Hospital at 130 Avenue Edward VII, staying in room number 31 of the hospital. Upon hearing the news, the French police immediately dispatched officers to investigate.</p>
<p>Disguised as Chinese Sailors Last night, the Xinzha Road Police Station detectives arrested three Japanese ruffians in their jurisdiction at 10:30 PM. The reason for the arrest was that the three Japanese were disguised as Chinese sailors, walking along the road, and planned to rob a car of a certain number parked by the roadside. When detectives noticed, they arrested the three since martial law had been announced at that time. After questioning, it was revealed that they were Japanese ruffians in disguise. They were immediately detained and awaiting orders.</p>
<p>Stray Bullets at the Post Office The North Sichuan Road Post Office, north of Tiantong Road, is located very near the Japanese military defenses. Since the Merchant Corps stationed there, the interior has continued to operate as usual. The day before yesterday, because of the intense fighting, several stray bullets hit the north-facing toilet on the third floor of the building and the glass windows along Tiantong Road in the large package room downstairs, but no one was injured.</p>
<h3>National Goods Factory Association Investigates the Whereabouts of Xiang Songmao</h3>
<p>Requests the Municipal Council to Negotiate with the Japanese Consulate The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating, "Our Supervisory Committee member Xiang Songmao went to the Old Racecourse Road on January 30 to inspect the Wuzhou Pharmacy and has gone missing. It is rumored that he has been detained and harmed by the Japanese plainclothes team. Since the Japanese soldiers invaded our territory, the Japanese plainclothes team has been killing and arsoning in the Hongkou area, doing everything possible. The concession authorities have not taken effective measures to protect the residents of the concession, allowing them to run rampant and act lawlessly, which is alarming. We hereby specifically request your bureau to seriously negotiate with the Japanese consulate, ordering the plainclothes team to withdraw from the concession and investigate the whereabouts of Mr. Xiang."</p>
<h3>Gradually Returning Hongkou Police Authority to the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reports that after a special meeting of the Municipal Council yesterday (the 4th) afternoon, the authorities of the Public Concession have agreed with the Japanese naval commander to gradually return police authority in the Hongkou area to the police force. It is said that the Japanese attitude was initially quite strong, insisting that if the Japanese marines were to withdraw, the Japanese residents in the area could not fully trust the police force's capabilities. After much debate, both sides agreed on a compromise solution: the management of the area would be gradually returned, with Chinese and Indian constables cooperating with Japanese marines in patrols. It was agreed that the Municipal Council would first restore electricity to the Hongkou area and, starting today (the 5th), organize patrol teams of ten people each, consisting of one European constable, one Japanese constable, two Indian constables, four Chinese constables, one Japanese marine soldier, and one Japanese consulate policeman. Everyone entering Hongkou would be searched. The Japanese side also guaranteed that once the police force demonstrated its ability to maintain order, all marines would be withdrawn. Furthermore, the Japanese marines and veterans in the area along Route Puto and Route Macgregor have withdrawn to the Whangpoo Wharf and the Postal Steamship Company Wharf. The area, originally defended by British and American forces, is now entirely defended by British and American troops. However, Japanese troops are still stationed inside the Japanese cotton mills. The Zilin News reports that the Japanese troops stationed in the cotton mills inside and outside the Roberts Road and Penang Road area withdrew on Wednesday night and were replaced by British troops. The Da Mei Evening News reports that the situation in the Yangshupu and Hongkou districts this morning (the 5th) is gradually becoming calmer. A small number of police patrols are visible on the roads, and streetcars and automobiles are traveling more frequently. The number of Japanese sentries is less than in previous days, and they have probably been transferred to other areas for service. The arrogance of armed Japanese civilians has also diminished somewhat, and some people are acting as interpreters for the Japanese soldiers.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Investigates Missing Citizens</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, there have been repeated reports of Chinese citizens residing in the Hongkou area disappearing without cause. Yesterday, a Westerner inquired with the Municipal Council about what the concession authorities were doing about this serious matter. According to Mr. Zhong Si, the chief of the Municipal Council, the police force is doing its best to investigate the missing citizens. Anyone who has lost a single person can report it to the Hongkou Police Station. If an entire family is missing, it can be reported to the Chief Inspector's Office of the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Major Case Yesterday: American Warships Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>A total of seven destroyers</p>
<p>More than 1,200 soldiers</p>
<p>When the U.S. Navy's 31st Fleet sailed to Manila, all of its 1,200+ marines were also ordered to Shanghai to protect American nationals. They were transported to Shanghai on the transport ship USS Chaumont and arrived yesterday morning. After entering the port, the transport ship moored at the Northern Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. The U.S. Naval authorities decided to station the troops at the New World on Nanjing Road for temporary accommodation in order to deploy them as needed. Arrangements have already been made at the New World. The troops remained on the ship yesterday, awaiting orders to disembark. Since the arrival of the 31st Fleet, there are now a total of twelve American warships and six thousand soldiers in Shanghai, including 2,800 marines and the rest being naval personnel.</p>
<p>Ship Names The seven American warships that recently sailed to Shanghai from Manila entered the port at 9:00 AM yesterday and berthed along the Meifu Oil Depot wharf area in Yangshupu and Pudong opposite the river. In addition to the original sailors, each ship carried over three hundred marines, totaling approximately two thousand men. The names of the ships are listed below: (1) USS Robinson, (2) USS Ford, (3) USS Teary 226, (4) USS Whipple 217, (5) USS Topee 229, (6) USS Edwards, (7) USS Borker 213. A torpedo ship, named Chaumont, entered the port at 4:00 PM and moored with the previous seven ships.</p>
<h3>British Naval Commander-in-Chief Kelly Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Lands from Flagship HMS Kent Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>British Navy Far East Fleet Naval Commander-in-Chief Kelly, since the Japanese military's attack on Zhabei in Shanghai, immediately sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the flagship HMS Kent. The HMS Kent arrived in the Huangpu River yesterday morning, mooring at the British Navy's river buoy in the middle of the Huangpu River. The British cruiser HMS Cornwall, originally docked at the river buoy, moved to the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong. British Commander-in-Chief Kelly has already landed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Secretly Transport Army to Shanghai</h3>
<p>4,000 Arrive Yesterday</p>
<p>No Visitors Allowed</p>
<p>Four thousand Japanese army soldiers were transported to Shanghai yesterday on a special service ship, arriving yesterday morning. After landing at the Wayside Wharf, they were immediately sent to the front lines to join the fighting. It is said that the newly appointed Japanese naval commander in Shanghai, Nomura, will also arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that 4,000 Japanese sailors arrived in Shanghai today (the 5th) to reinforce the marines under Shiozawa's command. However, Japanese diplomats and naval authorities refused to disclose any information about the troop movements. This batch of reinforcements was brought in on a large transport ship and is now berthed at the Wayside Wharf. Ordinary officials who went to inquire were politely refused. A representative of the Da Mei Evening News tried to enter the wharf to board the ship for a look, but was driven back by Japanese soldiers with bayonets. According to sources from the foreign staff at noon today, a Japanese transport ship has transported 4,000 reinforcements. When the Japanese embassy was consulted, they feigned ignorance. The Japanese Naval Headquarters at 207 North Sichuan Road also remained silent. However, the transport ship, full of Japanese soldiers, was visible from the Huangpu River. It is possible that this is the first batch of an army division that the Japanese cabinet decided to send to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Furthermore, several more Japanese warships arrived in Shanghai yesterday, including: (1) the small warship Izumi, which entered the port at 7:00 AM yesterday and moored at the coal depot of the New Mitsui Wharf; (2) two Japanese destroyers, 22et3c, which entered the port at 7:10 AM yesterday and moored at buoys 21 and 22 in Yangshupu; (3) the transport ship Itada, which entered the port at 8:00 AM and moored at the Wayside Wharf in Tilanqiao. It is said that the ship carried twenty-four mountain guns, twenty heavy machine guns, fifty light machine guns, three hundred boxes of shells (fifty rounds per box), two hundred boxes of heavy machine gun bullets, two hundred boxes of light machine gun bullets, four hundred boxes of rifle bullets, and one thousand soldiers. After arriving at the port, the military equipment was immediately transported to the front lines, and the supplies were stored in warehouses at the Wayside Wharf.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the International Peace Promotion Association</h3>
<p>Given the unbridled actions of the violent Japanese and the widespread war in the Far East, prominent figures from political and academic circles in this city have been discussing for days how to sanction Japan for disrupting international peace and how to eliminate the war in the Far East. Yesterday, they formally established the International Peace Promotion Association. The initiators are Li Shizeng, Cai Jiemin, Wang Jingqi, Chu Minyi, Gao Lu, He Shangping, Song Wusheng, Zhu Fengqian, Zhu Xiaowei, Ge Jingzhong, Cai Wuji, Gu Shouxi, Xiao Jirong, Lin Junli, Ling Qihan, etc. They have already telegraphed famous figures in Europe and the United States, strongly pointing out Japan's various crimes of disrupting peace and hoping for a swift response to sanction Japan.</p>
<h3>Chaozhou Native Association Proposes Relief for Families of Soldiers</h3>
<p>Patriotic Soldiers Free from Worries Back Home</p>
<p>Posterity to Repay With Gratitude</p>
<p>Various groups in Shanghai, various provincial, municipal, and county groups, and various groups of overseas Chinese in overseas ports are all aware that the violent Japanese are acting like bandits, occupying our Northeast, and now using force at sea. Only General Ma Zhanshan, who rose up in Heilongjiang Province, has spoken for the people. Only our 19th Route Army officers and soldiers alone. I recently read in the newspaper that the officers of the 19th Route Army have sworn that the entire army officers and soldiers are willing to die to resist Japan and save the country. In addition, after the events of the past few days, we are convinced that the 19th Route Army can truly die to save the country and is not simply advocating high-sounding rhetoric. From now on, with a single call, the whole country will respond, and the strong men of the whole country will go to the rescue together. The survival of our country depends on this one action. Our association is filled with sorrow and indignation at this time of national crisis. We believe that no matter what army or unit dies for the country, they have died before us. We who are still alive have a great responsibility. What is this responsibility? It is none other than to plan for the well-being of the families of the officers and soldiers who have sacrificed themselves for the country. Indeed, the dead are gone, but what about the living? If this problem is solved, we can reward the soldiers who died in battle and encourage brave men to go to the rescue. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be supported by one group alone. Our association has now passed the principles of this important issue and is raising a large sum of money in preparation for relief. We hereby telegraph to your organization to agree and stipulate the method, so that the country's soldiers can be free from worries about their families, and the future generations will have the opportunity to repay them. Chaozhou Native Association, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Generous Donation from Germans</h3>
<p>1,700 Yuan Worth of Medicated Plaster</p>
<p>Benefits Our Wounded Soldiers and Civilians</p>
<p>The German company, Messengers &amp; Co., located at 6 Jiangxi Road in Shanghai, recognizing the large number of medical supplies needed due to the injuries suffered by our soldiers and civilians during the recent Japanese invasion, specifically donated rubber plaster, cotton, gauze, and bandages worth 1,700 yuan to the Red Cross Societies on Second Avenue and Haig Road to treat the wounded soldiers and civilians. It is evident that justice still exists, and the benevolence and righteousness of the Germans is truly admirable.</p>
<h3>Relief Efforts from Various Parties</h3>

<h3>The Question of a Neutral Zone in the Concession</h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in opposition to the establishment of a neutral zone, telegraphed the National Government on the 4th, stating: "To the National Government Executive Yuan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Your Excellencies: The four nations of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy have suggested to China and Japan to cease hostilities. It is reported that our government has completely accepted the five proposed conditions. However, the fourth condition, the establishment of a neutral zone to protect the Public Concession, is of great importance. We dare to present our views for consideration. During the Zhabei war, it was the Japanese army, not the Chinese army, that violated the neutrality of the Concession. Allowing the Japanese army to take over the security of the Concession and the adjacent areas of Zhabei as a base for attacking the Chinese army constitutes an abandonment of neutrality. Whose responsibility is it for violating the obligations of neutrality? It is very clear. Currently, for the sake of protecting the safety of the Public Concession, the four nations of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy only need to correct their previous mistakes, completely reclaim the security of the section of the Concession adjacent to Zhabei, and station international troops to strictly guard it. This is sufficient to ensure the safety of the Concession. Shanghai itself has a neutral zone, which is the so-called Public Concession. The original intention of establishing a neutral zone was to alleviate the conflict between the two armies. Since Shanghai already has an existing neutral zone that can separate the two conflicts, then to avoid the ravages of war, the Concession authorities must be able to maintain it with force. It is absolutely impermissible to establish a so-called neutral zone outside of the existing neutral zone, resulting in redundant measures. Therefore, this Chamber dares to suggest to the National Government in simple and clear terms that we oppose the establishment of a so-called neutral zone outside the existing neutral zone (i.e., the Public Concession). We earnestly request your adoption of this suggestion. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows, Zhi."</p>
<p>Su Jiarong: Su Jiarong's opinion on the neutral zone is as follows: "The governments of various countries have proposed five measures to mediate a ceasefire between China and Japan, and our government has fully accepted them. Today's newspapers report that the Japanese side has also accepted some of them. If a neutral zone is factually needed and properly demarcated, it would not harm our national sovereignty and could avoid war, then it seems that we do not need to oppose it. Therefore, instead of empty opposition to the establishment of a neutral zone, it is better to study the location and nature of the neutral zone for the reference of our diplomatic authorities and citizens, which would be more helpful to the facts. Before discussing the neutral zone, we should recognize the following undeniable facts: Zhabei is our country's territory. The areas between Zhabei and the Public Concession, such as the area north of Laobazi Road up to the Bazipark and North Sichuan Road, the so-called extraterritorial road areas, are also our country's territory. However, in fact, the Concession authorities exercise police power on the extraterritorial roads without any legal basis. Japan has even less right to them. Even within the Concession, it is still our country's territory, but it is a residence for foreigners with consular jurisdiction. In fact, during peacetime, Japan and other countries stationed a certain number of troops in Shanghai. When the situation between China and Japan became tense and before the war broke out, the Concession authorities designated the Hongkou area of the Concession for Japanese troops to guard. This was the same nature as the British and American troops guarding the central and western districts of the Public Concession, only to assist the Municipal Council's police in maintaining public order and protecting citizens, not to allow the Japanese marines transported by Japanese warships to use the Hongkou area as a base of operations. However, in fact, the Japanese army used the area for which they were responsible for security as a base for attacking our Chinese troops in Zhabei, and used all sorts of inhumane methods to massacre our Chinese people, and prevented the Municipal Council's police from going on duty. When the Japanese army won, they entered the Chinese territory; when they lost, they retreated into the Concession. Their reinforcements, large numbers of combat teams, landed from warships at the wharves in the eastern district of the Public Concession in Yangshupu, and rushed to the front line through the eastern district. On the North Station Jielu side, the Concession police line retreated from Jielu to Ai'erjin Road, which greatly benefited the Japanese army and greatly harmed our army. In addition, in the past two days, the Japanese army has also used large trucks to transport troops to the western district of the Concession, passing through the central district of the Concession without obstruction. Although the fighting in western Shanghai is not as intense as in Zhabei, it is also a fact that they occasionally provoke our army. Considering the above facts, a major reason for the expansion and persistence of the Shanghai war is that the Concession authorities abandoned part of the neutrality of their Public Concession, which invisibly gave the Japanese army a great advantage. If the security responsibility of the Hongkou area of the Concession had not been entrusted to the Japanese army in advance, or if the Concession authorities could have quickly stopped the Japanese army from using the security area for combat with force, then the Japanese marines would have no place to land, and no route to reach the war zone. The small part of the extraterritorial road area would have been completely swept away by our army, and why would there have been fierce fighting for seven or eight days, and it has not ended yet? The Concession authorities entrusted the Hongkou Concession to the Japanese army, and have not been able to impose the necessary sanctions on the Japanese army to restore the neutrality of the Concession. We do not want to speculate or criticize the intentions of the Concession authorities. We only hope that they will quickly remedy this great mistake. Therefore, if we want the war to stop expanding and end as soon as possible, we must quickly restore the neutrality of the northern district (Hongkou) and eastern district (Yangshupu) of the Public Concession, which is enough to avoid contact between the two armies. The Concession was originally a neutral zone, and there is no need to seek a neutral zone outside the neutral Concession, and even less should we sit by and watch the neutrality of the Concession being violated by the Japanese army without any remedy, but instead set up some kind of neutral zone. This is what we cannot but hope that friends from various countries will pay great attention to. In this war, the Japanese army is the aggressor and our army is being attacked. If the neutrality of the Concession is restored, there is still a need for a neutral zone outside the Concession to avoid contact between the two armies. Then, as a matter of course, this neutral zone cannot be within our invaded territory. In other words, there is absolutely no reason to establish a neutral zone in Zhabei. From our observation, this neutral zone can at most be in the narrow, elongated area north of Laobazi Road and North Sichuan Road to Bazichang, i.e., the extraterritorial road area. The temporality of this neutral zone is also only temporary, not permanent, limited to the time when the area is not safe and the pre-war order is restored. At most, it may be extended until the Northeast Incident is resolved, but it is definitely not a permanent sentry line as the Japanese side claims. As for the so-called Japanese district claimed by the Japanese side, it is even less worthy of the knowledge of those who laugh. Songhu Road and Jinghu Road are our lines of communication between the Wusong Fortress and the capital and Shanghai. In any case, they cannot be included in the neutral zone. This is what our authorities and the people must pay special attention to. As for what I said earlier about establishing a neutral zone in the extraterritorial road area, it may be something that our people are unwilling to hear. However, before the mediation of the various countries is realized and a ceasefire is agreed upon, if our army drives the Japanese army out of this area, which was originally Chinese territory, our army does not have to worry about anything. Then, it is another matter to only restore the neutrality of the Concession. There is absolutely no need to set up a neutral zone."</p>

<h3>Soong Zi-wen Reappointed as Governor of the Central Bank</h3>
<p>Xu Jiyun Resigns from Both Positions</p>
<p>Since the National Government appointed Soong Zi-wen as Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, all the heads of departments under the Ministry of Finance have been the same as those during Soong's previous term. Yesterday, Soong was ordered to be reappointed as Governor of the Central Bank. The former Deputy Governor, Chen Xing, was also reinstated at the same time, and he requested that Tang Shoumin be reappointed as General Manager of the Business Bureau and Li Jue as Director of the Issuance Bureau. They will take office immediately. Chen Qinghua will remain as Chief Secretary of the Secretariat. The directors and supervisors of the bank will also be appointed as before: the directors are Soong Zi-wen, Chen Xing, Ye Zhuotang, Wang Shilun, Tang Shoumin, Qian Yongming, Chen Guangfu, Rong Zongjing, and Zhou Zongliang. Soong Zi-wen, Chen Xing, Ye Zhuotang, Wang Shilun, and Tang Shoumin are designated as executive directors.

<h3>He Yingqin Telegraphed Request for Huge Sums for Military Expenses</h3>
<p>He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Affairs in Nanjing, sent a telegram to Mayor Wu of Shanghai, forwarding it to Mr. Sun Zhesheng and Mr. Gu Mengyu, and all members of the Central Committee: "The military expenses are extremely urgent. When Mr. Huang Han was in office at the Ministry of Finance, he only found 3.2 million in cash for the military expenses. After distributing it to the various units, there was very little left. Even the soldiers' half-full rations are insufficient. For a while, we may still be able to temporarily borrow tax revenues or various public funds from the provinces where they are stationed to support them. This month, there is nothing left to borrow. If this continues, the army will inevitably become hungry and dispersed. How can we maintain it? At this time of national crisis, you gentlemen cannot bear to ignore it. I beg you to jointly raise huge sums of money in Shanghai to provide relief. This is my earnest prayer, He Yingqin, Zhi You, Seal."</p>
<h3>What We Hear About the Activities of the Japanese Army in the Concession</h3>
<p>It is undeniable that the Japanese marines rely on the Concession to carry out various military activities. However, the rumor that the Japanese have set up an ammunition depot inside Mitsui at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Fujian Road has been found to be untrue. As for the Sanyuan Palace on East Wuchang Road, only a few Japanese soldiers are stationed there, and there are not as many as 500.</p>
<h3>The Songkou Sea Route is Open</h3>
<p>There are still many Ningbo people in Shanghai who want to return to their hometown to avoid the disaster. Yesterday, because there was no more fighting in Wusong, merchant ships could pass through. Therefore, the Taikoo Company's Zhoushan ship was fully loaded with refugees in Shanghai and went directly to Ningbo Port.</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company also scheduled four ships, Nanning, Xin Beijing, Yingzhou, and Ningbo, to sail to Ningbo at 10 AM today (6th). The ships are docked at the Taikoo Wharf. The Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai has chartered a Guangfu ship, which can accommodate more than 2,000 passengers, and will also depart directly to Ningbo Port at 10 AM this morning. The ship is docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants.</p>
<h3>Good News for Passengers Evacuating to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Travel Agencies Sell Tickets as Usual Today</p>
<p>The number of passengers evacuating to Hangzhou has been increasing recently. The ticket office at the South Station is unusually crowded. Some people wait at the station all day to buy tickets but are unable to do so and return home. Others rush to board the train without buying tickets and suffer unspeakable hardships. The China Travel Service at Baxianqiao (New Building of the YMCA), in view of this situation, will continue to issue passenger tickets for the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway today to facilitate the evacuation of passengers.</p>

<p>Proposing Measures to Stop the Sino-Japanese Conflict</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs unofficially announced on the 4th the note from Britain, the United States, and other countries to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The original text is as follows: "For the matter of note, I have received instructions from my government to forward to your government the following notification regarding the proposals of the nations to stop the conflict: (1) Both parties shall immediately cease all acts of violence based on the following conditions. (2) The two countries shall no longer mobilize or prepare any hostile acts. (3) The Chinese and Japanese combatants in Shanghai shall withdraw from the points of contact with each other. (4) A neutral zone shall be established to separate the combatants of both sides to protect the Public Concession. This area shall be garrisoned by the military police of neutral countries. Various measures shall be formulated by the consular body. (5) Once the two countries accept these conditions, they should first raise requests or reservations and then, in the spirit of the Non-Aggression Pact and the UN Resolution of December 9, promptly conduct consultations with the assistance of neutral observers or participants to resolve all outstanding disputes. I have the honor to address this note and request your Minister to take note of it. (Special Dispatch, 4th)"</p>

Similar notes have been successively received. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' replies are also addressed to the five countries of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. (Special Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Replies to Notes from Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied: "For the matter of reply, I have received your Excellency's note notifying the Chinese National Government of your government's various proposals for resolving the current incident. Because the National Government is earnestly willing to strictly abide by the international agreements sufficient to ensure world peace, as well as the independence of national sovereignty and the integrity of territorial administration, it hereby accepts the proposals notified by your government. Furthermore, since the friendly nations have a great relationship with the Far Eastern situation, not only for the general interests of peace, but also for the dignity of the aforementioned international agreements jointly signed by the friendly nations, the Chinese National Government earnestly hopes that the friendly nations, rather than as observers, will participate in future consultations as participants. As for the terms neutral area and neutral persons used in Section 4 of the proposal, what the National Government wishes to point out is that said terms are not applicable to the current situation on the Chinese side. Therefore, it is proposed that they be changed to peaceful area and third country. I have the honor to reply accordingly. (Central News Agency, 4th)"</p>
<h3>Japan Lacks Sincerity for Peace</h3>
<p>Rejects Two Peace Proposals</p>
<p>Advocates Setting Up a Permanent Sentry Zone</p>
<p>(Washington) The Japanese response has only been received in outline today. The original text still awaits transmission by the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Fuku Shiraishi. Relevant members of the State Department are currently studying it. It is reported that the response rejects the second and fifth items of the original plan. It is claimed that Japan is willing to cease hostilities if China provides sufficient guarantees for a ceasefire. The second item is the cessation of military preparations, and the fifth item is the immediate and unconditional commencement of negotiations based on the spirit of the Non-Aggression Pact and the UN Resolution of December 9 to resolve all outstanding issues. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is reported that the State Department feels that Japan's rejection of the Anglo-American peace proposals has not closed the door to further suggestions from the countries concerned. It is reported that the Japanese Foreign Minister told the US Ambassador to Japan that Japan would welcome further suggestions from the great powers. It is reported that the State Department has not yet formulated new suggestions and will probably consult with the British government and other countries concerned before formulating them. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>London</h3>
<p>Although Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa stated to reporters yesterday that Japan could not agree to the great powers' proposals regarding the Shanghai case, London has not yet received a formal reply. It is reported that although Japan agreed to the proposal to establish a neutral zone, it will suggest establishing a permanent sentry zone in place of a temporary neutral zone. Although the Japanese reply may not mention this, it is certain that Japan will take this action. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today it was learned that the Japanese government has invited the Western powers to continue to make suggestions in the hope of resolving the Shanghai case. People in the State Department now expect that the US response may not be sent out until the evening of tomorrow. Stimson met with General MacArthur and Rear Admiral Brite today, presumably to discuss the Shanghai matter.</p>
<p>(National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>London</h3>
<p>Responsible circles here are now carefully considering Japan's reply to the five-item peace plan. Since China has fully accepted this plan, and Japan has rejected two items out of the five, this matter seems likely to become a problem for the exchange of telegrams between Geneva and the capitals of the countries concerned. Therefore, the reply to Japan may not be issued until next week. However, there is now hope of accepting Japanese assurances in order to provide some respite and at the same time seek a new plan for the fifth item that can satisfy the great powers. This plan must dispel US fears about the open door. All Conservative newspapers are now paying attention to the development of the tariff issue, while Liberal newspapers this morning still express great dissatisfaction with Japan's reply. The Manchester Guardian says, "Regardless of any expressions of good faith and desire for peace, the reply has proven its falsity with the constant attacks of brutal schemes and brutal practices." Japan's move is actually an attempt to occupy a large part of Shanghai's territory and administrative power by force. The newspaper also said that the powers may be able to prove their ability to deal with the situation better, as their own interests are now at risk. For now, it is appropriate to apply real pressure, otherwise Japan's violence will not end. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Peng Gu and Yan Huiqing met and declared that since Japan has rejected two of the conditions proposed by the great powers, it now seems doubtful whether the Sino-Japanese conflict will be resolved by the Executive Yuan. (Havas, 4th)</p>

The various decisions listed in the document have been agreed upon by General Pétain and General Weygand. This plan has been kept strictly confidential so far.

<h3>French Member of Parliament Proposes to Restrict Imports of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Impose a Surtax in Addition to the Regular Tax</p>
<p>(Paris) Member of Parliament Torales proposed a draft resolution, proposing that the government issue an order to impose a surcharge to regulate exchange rates on Japanese goods imported into French territory, in addition to the regular tax. Since the fall of the Japanese yen, Japanese goods have been increasingly competing with French goods, so this tax is set to restrict them. This additional tax is temporary, and negotiations should still be conducted with Japan in the future to conclude a commercial treaty. The Tariff Committee of the House of Representatives expressed great approval of Torales' proposal. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Import Tax Increase Bill</h3>
<p>Moderate Protective Tariff System</p>
<p>(London) British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons tonight that the government has decided to introduce a moderate protective tariff system. This system is scientifically suitable for the needs of British agriculture and industry in order to reorganize the unfavorable balance in trade. From March 1st, all imported goods, except for wheat, meat, fish, raw cotton, wool, tea, and other items that already require taxation, will be subject to a basic tax of 10%. A surcharge will also be levied based on this basic tax. However, the surtax may only be levied by the Ministry of Finance after the Super-Advisory Committee decides. Before the Imperial Economic Conference is held in Ottawa, goods from India or autonomous territories will not be subject to the basic tax or the surtax. Products from territories and protectorates are generally exempt from tax. The British government attaches great importance to the Ottawa Economic Conference and is eager to expand trade between the various parts of the British Empire. Any goods that discriminate against British goods will be subject to a surtax of no more than 100% by the British government. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Sends Telegram from Luoyang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, issued a telegram from Luoyang today, stating that the Liaoning case has been delayed for four months and has not yet been resolved. This is because China is determined not to sign a treaty that damages Chinese land and administrative sovereignty. If the Chinese government were willing to sign the Twenty-One Demands like Yuan Shikai, this case would have been resolved long ago. The result would inevitably lead to the loss of rights and humiliation of the country. It is precisely because of not signing the treaty that Japan has attacked places such as Shenyang, Qiqihar, Jinzhou, Harbin, and Rehe. Japan's actions are purely to use force to coerce China into abandoning its sovereignty. Japan has decided to continue with its methods because the Chinese government has resolutely refused to sign such a treaty. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
