<p>時評</p>
<h3>學者會談救國　彬·</h3>
<p>最近行政院長汪精衛爲研究敎育經濟外交財政等問題。特邀集國内（學者）（名流）胡適之了文江陶希聖等三十餘人蒞京。舉行談話會。此次集議。據云僅就私誼立塲。以學術專家研究態度。貢獻意見。並不受會議形式之拘束。政治當局爲廣徵民意。博採輿論。對於某一艱難問題。徵集全國學者。共同討論。交換意鑡。本爲極尋常之事。獨是徒有會議。從不實行。空談闊論。無裨實際。此爲我國政治上之大病。古有云（爲政不在多言。）吾人謹就此點一陳所見。</p>
<p>我國今日誠已臨到非常之時期。言經濟則凋敝不堪。言敎育則窳敗已極。言財政則已至山窮水盡之窘境。言外交則更惟有任人操持。任人宰割。國勢至此。是誠惟有集合全國人民之智力。以共謀此非常時期之打破。初不容以此重任。獨責之於少數之政治當局。但自東省禍發迄今。全國人民。對於如何改革内政。如何樹立外交方針。亦已盡所欲言。如樹立廉潔政治。如以自力謀自衛自救。泣血呼籲。實已舉國同聲。如曰博採民意。則是即輿論也。即民意也。政府如能本此民意努力。以謀當前艱難之打破。則何至目前日即於艱境。　且不能自拔。不能接受眞實之民意。而欲從（學者）（名流）之清談中。謀民族之出路。斯亦異已。</p>
<p>即以會議而言。東省禍變而後。殆亦無日不會。無日不議。舉其大者。在黨有統一和平會議。二中三中會議。在徵詢民意。亦已有（羣賢畢集）之國難會議。每一次會議。於内政外交無不成立决議。定有方案。同時每一次會議之後。政府昭示人民。亦無不曰内政外交。都已有具體。辦法。然而事過境遷。則此所謂具體辦法。從未見諸事實。而長被擱置紙上。迨一時清夜夢醒。或迫於事實。則又倉促徵集（學者）（名流。）倉促集會。而此種種之問題。又重新提付討論研究。則又照例成立决議。定下方案。會議日多。方案日積。而國難則終始原封未動。清談誤國。得母類是。吾人誠不敢謂今日行政院召集（學者）（名流。）討論種種問題爲非是。但吾人敢問和平統一會議二中三中會議以及國難會議所决議之方案。進行已至若何之程度。如决議早已擲諸字簏。方案早被遺忘。則今日之集議。殆爲無謂。或更且近於兒戲。蔣介石氏日前在廬山對各省軍政長官訓話。謂今後爲政。應（快做）（硬做）（實做。）吾人今亦敢以此語恭獻諸當局。</p>
<p>抑吾人尚有未能已於言者。邇近關於解决東北問題之方針。傳說紛紜。有謂將劃東省爲自治區者。有謂東省將由中日共管者。更有謂將實際承認二十一條者。雖傳說不必眞。但我人民則不無疑懼。同時此次會議。胡適之氏亦被邀列席。胡氏在獨立評論第五期上發表對日外交方針一文。提出綱領九項。其最要者爲。</p>
<p>中國政会應該表示願意依據十月中日本在國聯提出的五項原則。進行與日本交涉東三省的善後問題。</p>
<p>中國不妨自動的主張東三省的解除軍備。中國與日本俄國皆不得在東三省駐紮軍隊。</p>
<p>關於鐵路的爭議。應該由兩國鐵路專家會議。依據現有各種條約。作切合事實的協商。</p>
<p>關於土地商租的問題。中國應該要求在政治改良與司法革新的條件之下。日本臣民在東三省居住或經營農工商業者不得享受領事裁判權。中日兩國締結的新條約。不但應該解决該久懸的爭端。並且應該遠矚將來。確立遠東兩大民族可以實行共存共榮的基礎。</p>
<p>胡氏此種主張。實即變相的放棄東省。實際的承認二十一條。換言之。即於張學良以不抵抗主義陷東北於淪亡後。復加以條約上之保障。如此學者之見解。與其謂爲超越一般人民。母寗謂爲眞正民意之障礙。如此外交方案。與其謂爲（實際的救國。）母寗謂爲（永遠的誤國。）此絕非我人民之公意。更非我人民所敢贊同。此又爲吾人所不得不向政府當局鄭重聲明者也。</p>

<h3>麥相致詞含意深遠</h3>
<p>簽字畢、麥唐納乃以非常深沉之音調致詞曰、吾人之工作、確已告竣、吾人經三星期後始獲妥協、因舊事之在記憶中者過多、而一旦欲拔除之、較任何事爲難、以故妥協不易即達、吾人在此之工作、已於歷史中置一新頁、此非一章之結局、而實爲新卷之起點、彼加諸一國之巨數欵項、實非兩肩之担負、而爲各國之創痛、前加於德國之担負、曾擾亂世界之貿易、遠如紐絲輪澳大利亞变爲波及、即　可支持之美國、亦如吾人之大受打擊矣、公共之繁榮、實有　乎各個之繁榮、歐洲不能獨自存在、吾人不認在歐洲周圍築一壁壘、在此間簽字之協定與條約、必須有他處之回應、余之希望、乃在日内瓦告成大功、而終止濫費金錢於軍備、惟軍縮今尚未成熟、吾人在各國間必須具勇氣與信任、及行道德的軍縮、吾人必須邁步前進、俟達安寗與和平之目的而後已、今日德國所取之態度、實須具大無畏之精神、吾人必須伸出親善之温手、並鼓勵各國奮鬥、擺脫舊日之束縛、吾人需各國之共同工作、欲達此目的、吾人東方之友必須加入、（麥氏語至此、面向日代表團）日本必須加入、並對國聯表示忠誠、同於他國、以待吾人均可坐於自己之無花果樹下、以享和平云云、會衆聞麥氏質樸而含深意之演說、皆大爲感動、喝采之聲、震耳欲聾、麥氏致詞畢、赫禮歐以表象的花球、分贈各職員秘書新聞家專家及與會議工作有關之人、麥氏於最後用其主席之小錘前聲稱、渠對於會議結果、不無抱憾、但渠對於洛桑之成就、固可傲然欣然離此而歸也、會議於十一時二十五分閉幕、嗣由洛桑市議會以榮譽證分贈各代表及各報代表等、</p>
<h3>洛桑公約條文内容</h3>
<p>▲路透社九日洛桑電昨日下午一時外間始悉歐戰後阻碍世界政治經濟恢復之賠欵問題、已獲解决矣、是時英相麥唐納從　塲出、告記者曰、（不久將有極好消息）法總理赫禮歐美亦離會、與奮異常、大聲呼曰（已辦妥矣）、時記者　中適有妙齡女郎二人、一德一法、赫覩之趨吻其頰、表示其欣悅也、議妥之條約、將稱爲一九三二年恪桑公約、内容分三部、（一）導言、（二）政治宣言書、（三）决議案五項、宣言書最重要之部分如次、（各簽字國爲應付因歐戰而發生種種問題之　起見、特於洛桑召集會議、各抱决心、謀闢新局面、俾世界各國互相信任、和平友好精神日益增長、洛桑會議之結果、已使賠欵完全終止、各簽字國非敢自詡、即此可以保障各國同心願望之和平、但望歐洲及世界之和平份子、明瞭在若此艱辛困難中所獲結果之重要、并望繼洛桑會議之後、將有新貢獻、如各國一致擁護爲謀眞正和平之努力、則今之初步成就、可更趨穏固、但此項努力必並施於政治經濟兩方、且拒絕一切採取軍事行動或武力之可能、方得稱爲完全、各簽字國將繼續努力、依此協定之精神、謀當前或嗣後發生一切問題之解决）云云</p>
<p>第一條决議案　言對德協定、關於供給價值三十萬萬馬克之債券事、規定此項債券、照實收九十、年息五釐、提百分一充凖備金、但非至三年後、市塲情形可許此項債券依照上述辦法發行書、不得發行、如從批准日起逾十五年、猶未能將此債券發行、則須作廢、此項債券由國際清理銀行保存、專充歐洲善後基金、</p>

<p>接國外要電</p>
<p>第三條决議案　言及德國以外之賠欵、聲明比英德法意五國已依允進行援助奥國之一種計畫、而以爲趨向歐洲東部與東南部善後之第一步驟、此案並規定布國與匃牙利賠欵償付之履行、應保留至十二月十五日、</p>

<h3>政治附件禁用干戈</h3>
<p>▲國民社八日洛桑電洛桑協定尚有一政治附件、惟措辭殊含混、略謂簽約國意見認洛桑會議之工作、雖極重要、並需各方面巨大犧牲、但仍不能充分獲致永久之和平、爲鞏固此工作維持政治與經濟方面之和平計、各國今後應禁止重用干戈或任何方式之武力云云、</p>
<h3>美準備履行諾言</h3>
<p>考慮戰債問題</p>
<p>▲路透社九日倫敦電據華盛頓路透訪電稱、美國務院對於洛桑協定、表示欣悅、國務院人員聲稱、美國前曾允許俟歐洲諸國議定賠欵問題時、可考慮債欵之改訂、今美國可準備履行其諾言、但歐洲諸國必須各個提出其辦法、因美國始終以分别考慮歐洲十五債務國事爲政策也云、</p>
<p>▲路透社九日洛桑電華盛頓傳來對負債國商請美國手續之警告、此爲全世界對洛桑解决之反響之最有關係者、華盛頓表示意見、謂就策略上之觀察點而論、</p>
<p>負債國如在本年十一月美國選舉總統以前商諸美國、實屬不智、蓋此種行動、不特有固結國會反對整理債務情緒之可能、且將使全國趨於此途也、以衆院接解决消息所發生於反響、可爲明證、衆議員麥克法登現以美國喪失數萬兆金之歸咎於胡佛總統與共和黨、麥氏曾發痛言曰、此爲美國光榮的孤立政策之結果云、著名美國銀行家、則視洛桑解决、爲祛除全世界復原重大障碍之一、惟彼等對於洛桑解决將爲商業凋敝中之轉機點一層、尚不敢輕發豫料、</p>
<h3>德意志復興可期</h3>
<p>▲國民社八日洛桑電按照楊格計劃、德國自目下至一九八八年三月三十一日止、尚需繳付一千一百十五萬八千九百二十萬馬克、今在洛桑協定祇須繳付三十萬萬馬克、相差何啻天壞、不可謂非德國復興途徑上之一大成功、</p>
<h3>巴本發播音演說</h3>
<p>國社黨猶抨擊不遺餘力</p>
<p>▲國民社八日柏林電今晚德總理巴本自洛桑用無線電向德國廣播演說、巴本氏稱、德國從今以後、不需再向任何國家作任何方式之供奉云云、巴氏之宣言、實已引起全國人民自歐戰後第一次之歡欣、巴氏並宣稱、依據楊格計畫、德國應付出賠欵三百三十萬萬馬克之鉅、今此鉅欵担負、已由洛桑會議一筆勾銷、從此過去一切、將作一總結束、而開此後歐洲復興之新局面、並恢復世界之信用、此種重要措施、復可認爲德國在國際　信用之復元、及德國經濟財政自主權之重建、而德國境内一切鐵道國家銀行等等、將從此脫離國際間之束縛云、巴氏復稱、德國爲脫離賠欵之担負起見、已允在不損及德國經濟利益之相當條件之下、再付一總數共三十萬萬馬克、此數代表在胡佛緩付賠欵計畫中所遲付之數、及德國與歐洲各國所共同担負之歐洲善後經費、巴本氏復稱、在洛桑會議中歐戰責任問題及同等待遇問題等、曾由各國政治領袖加以詳盡之討論而解决時期則己極接近、雖有某某等國不願直接承認德國所爭持之各點、然德國之態度已爲各國所共見共諒、嗣後政府將竭力利用洛桑會議中所取得之國際政治行動自由權、以謀德國見解之宣傳、而促以上各問題即速解决之實現、故政府對於全國人民在此外交緊急期中竭誠擁護之熱心毅力、實深欣感云云、</p>
<p>▲國民社九日柏林電柏林報紙抨擊洛桑協定頗烈、對於總理巴本個人攻擊尤力、大多數報紙均稱、德國債務之負担依然未釋、國家社會黨要人更斥現政府同意於法國條件、要求打倒巴本政府、倡言德國母須受洛桑所簽條約之拘束、按國家社會黨與其他方面之反對、實有數種動機、其主要者、當德代表赴會時聲稱、决意不再付一芬尼、今仍允付三十萬萬馬克、德人希望獲得軍備之均等、未能辦到、再德代表未能取消和約戎首條欵、尤爲衆怒之的、</p>
<h3>英各界表示欣慰</h3>
<p>▲國民社八日倫敦電今日英王致電麥唐納、對於洛桑會議之成功、表示私人賀忱、</p>
<p>▲路透社九日倫敦電倫敦政界與商界、聞洛桑公約之消息後、表示極大滿意、希望危險的戰爭心理之時代、從此告終、而商業凋敝之狀况、或將由此轉機、英相麥唐納在洛桑工作中最著勤勞、屢次挽回已漸渙釋之希望、雖辛勞過甚、體力幾不可支、然猶勉力撑持、必達到其最後目的而後已、故英人因其有志竟成、尤覺欣慰、賠欵問題解决之消息、首由英相以電話告知英政府、時自治地大臣湯姆士在下院發言、參加愛爾蘭問題之辯論、聞此消息、即終止其辯論詞、而以洛桑好消息報告下院、</p>
<h3>法德感想之異同</h3>
<p>巴黎訪電稱、法國對此消息雖無歡忭表示、但亦覺寬慰、法人謂法國犧牲多而無所獲、但法人亦賀赫禮歐之能顧全大局、柏林電稱德國輿論分兩派、穏健派以德國在此協定中、有所成就爲慰、彼等以爲世界經濟恢復之途、應由此而開放、但國家主義派則不滿谥巴本總理之放棄政治要求、謂將於七月三十一日國會選舉中、重伸其主張云、</p>
<p>▲路透電柏林各報之評論、謂洛桑解决所可令人告慰者、德國終已脫除賠欵之極重擔負、而令人失望者、德國未如所願、而博得政治上之讓步、法報皆稱讚會議之成功、惟右黨各報、則雜以訾議、著名著作家裴蒂那謂此約之價值不能即現、因一切擊於美國之進退故也、</p>
<h3>意政策始終貫澈</h3>
<p>又據羅馬訪電稱、意人歡迎洛桑恊定、認爲墨索里尼十年來所抱一筆勾銷政策之實現、意人對於英相麥唐納始終不懈之堅忍精神、極稱讚之、羅馬敎廷亦甚愉快、謂此協定與一九二二年起敎皇所抱之主張、若合符節云、</p>
<h3>日本財政困窘</h3>
<p>對華輸出銳减　軍費支出浩繁</p>
<p>外匯價格跌落　資金不斷外流</p>
<p>▲路透社八日東京電此間財政專家與路透訪員談時、均表示日本財政問題之嚴重、據稱、國家財政之狀况、農區之恐慌、東省之事態、皆爲極端緊急問題、日本證劵在國外交易所價格之低落、足以證明各國對於日本地位之顧慮云、日本輸入仍較輸出爲多、當局殊抱不安、但某方面稱、自今而後將見輸入銳减、輸出增加、經營出口事業者甚望日金價格之跌落、將使日絲之需求較增、日本閣員中有謂日金之匯兌價、不足證明日本之眞正財政况狀、彼等深信日金匯兌價、將逐漸增加、另一方面有勢力者預料日金將跌至合美金一角八分之低度、惟負責方面指此爲無慮的政客與投機家之談、大藏省已發出取締資金流出之嚴峻條例、苟不得官塲核准、資金不得移入他國、日本境内銀行不得接收外幣存欵、非經特許、不得發行外幣債劵、大藏相有權頒發將各種外國證劵及外幣存欵售與日本銀行之命令、且有權索取關於外國匯兌與證劵交易之報告、商行或個人有外幣或外國資產或外國債務在日金四千元以上者、必須於三十天内詳報、此種防止資金流出之法律、將如何切實辦理、現尚無把握、大約大藏省可便宜行事、以實施此條例、綜之日本現狀、可謂爲刻在流動不定之狀態中、或將績行募債、以應付其義務、但此舉是否適當、有數方面對之、不無疑慮、</p>
<h3>調查團會見日陸相</h3>
<p>荒木表示决意承認僞國</p>
<p>絕對不容第三者之干預</p>
<p>▲日聯社九日東京電國聯調查委員長代理馬柯迪·及委員麥考益·克勞代·希尼·今晨十時偕秘書長哈斯及隨員五人、往訪荒木陸相作重要會見、日陸軍方面荒木陸相·小磯次官·山岡軍務局長·山下軍事課長·古城新聞班長·鈴木中佐·久健·田海軍大佐·調查團參員吉田大使·及津島書記官出席、先由外務省川崎作翻譯、陸相與馬柯迪寒暄後、調查團對軍部提出如次三項質問、（一）日本國防與滿洲之關係、（二）日本對於滿洲治安恢復之方針、（三）滿洲國之將來、及日軍部對此態度、荒木陸相對此說明日本建國之本義及文化、國民之理想、明治維新以來國際關係、中日·日俄·兩戰役與滿洲之關係等事項、並力說日本與滿洲之國防不可分離、謂（滿洲國之存在、日本爲自衛關係、不能不負責任指導該國、故嗣後滿洲國内部如有擾亂秩序者、或受外部的脅威時、吾人爲日本建國精神與理想、不能不用充分之覺悟與力量、至於撤兵時期、尚未考慮、）陸相最後表示軍部重大决意、謂（吾人絕對反對中國主權之及於滿洲國）、至十二時二十五分會見始畢、</p>
<p>▲路透社九日東京電今晨國聯調查團各員除李頓勳爵外、曾往晤陸相荒木、歷時約一句鐘、談話情形、未經當局公布、但據下午各報載稱、荒木曾向調查員發表意見、如下、（一）日本願見（滿洲國）之穏健發展、（二）日本一俟（滿洲國）組織完備、當予承認、（三）日本何時撤兵、渠猶未考慮及之、蓋第一步須先恢復治安也、（四）永不許滿洲歸還中國、（五）滿洲爲日本生命所繫、故日本防務問題與滿洲防務問題、實不能分開云云、李頓勳爵因體未復原、故不能會晤日政府人員、但希望能於下星期二日謁見新外相内田、</p>

<h3>上台纔及兩月　齋藤暴露無能</h3>
<p>▲日聯九日東京電齋藤首相自從五月拜受大命以來、組織舉國一致之超然内閣、然人事問題、屢次曝露無氣力、無定見、及内閣不統一之狀態、尤其在調動地方長官及更换樺太長官時關於人事更動之根本方針、受政友會閣員之痛擊、又滿鐵總裁問題、竟在白日之下曝露政府部内無統制以政治手段之事、永井拓相與荒木陸相爲此問題互相傾軋、政府一旦决定之重大人事問題、又復搖動、所謂聯立内閣之前途、頗堪憂慮、</p>
<h3>滿鐵總裁繼任問題</h3>
<p>荒木與拓相傾軋</p>
<p>▲電通九日東京電滿鐵總裁後任問題、因軍部反對、陷於停頓狀態、永井拓相昨夜九時訪齋藤首相、商善後策後、繼訪荒木陸相、說明推薦梶原之事情、求其諒解、陸相不允、另提總裁後任之新候補者、求其再行考慮、永井拓相以旣得各閣員之贊成、决始終堅持原案、萬一不能通過、則成爲永井拓相之面目問題、預料政局必掀起軒然大波、至陸相所新提出軍部意中之人、爲預備陸軍大將之技術本部長吉田豐彥、</p>
<p>▲電通社九日東京電荒木陸相於今日下午四時、往外務相訪内田外相、報告今日陸相與調查團會見之内容、後對滿鐵總裁問題、互相交換意見、兩相意見一致、反對即時解决、荒木陸相歸陸軍省後、即以電話通告永井拓相、謂問題重大、不宜即决、望深加考慮後再决定、</p>
<p>▲電通社九日東京電政友會山口幹事長於今日下午四時、往訪三土鐵相及鳩山文相、謂擬任梶原氏爲滿鐵繼任總裁事、實質上梶原氏係民政黨黨員、又非處理非常時局之人物、故在政友會則舉黨反對該氏、請代請齋藤首相加以考慮、</p>
<p>▲電通社九日東京電今日下午二時、柴田内閣秘書長往訪齋藤首相、謂梶原繼任滿鐵總裁事、鑑於軍部仍主强硬反對之態度、本問題不能早日解决、不若管至下星期一日解决之、首相深諒此言、</p>

<h3>日本陰謀</h3>

<h3>牛蘭夫婦</h3>
<p>繼續絕食情况</p>
<p>▲醫生診察後已進藥數次</p>
<p>▲候證人到庭再定審訊期</p>
<p>牛蘭案經江蘇高等法院三次之審訊後、現因尚須另傳證人、故八日並未開庭審訊、牛蘭夫婦八日仍繼續絕食、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>▲牛蘭夫婦仍絕食牛蘭夫婦因堅持移轉管轄、八日仍繼續絕食、此已爲第七日矣、江寗地方法院院長周韞輝·首席檢察官樓榮·看守所所長龔寬等、八日屢次規勸牛蘭夫婦進食、對管轄問題、靜候法院裁定、但牛蘭夫婦、毫不爲動、聞牛蘭夫婦、七日經醫生診察後、曾進藥二次、八日上午、該院又聘請南京醫院院長夏禹鼎、前往診察、下午五時、又請鼓樓醫院之西醫斐蘭特診證、先後進藥二次、裴醫士診察時、牛蘭夫婦均仰臥床上、言語時聲音微弱、身體谱極疲乏、裴醫士遵法院之請、力勸牛蘭夫婦進食、二人均連呼否否、當由裴醫士留給藥水藥粉、牛蘭夫婦均先後服食、據牛蘭表示、彼現尚願延長其生命、俾移轉管轄問題、得以解决、由上海第二分院審訊、但在未解决前、則繼續絕食云、</p>
<p>▲裴醫士之診斷書鼓樓醫院之美籍醫士裴蘭特、七日診斷牛蘭後、八日將診斷書送至、八日之診斷書、須九日方能送達江寗地方法院、該院看守所所長龔寬、將根據此項診斷書、呈報江蘇高法院、診斷書爲英文、其槪要如次、牛妻今（七日）日爲絕食之第六日、據其自述、除水外未進其他食物、且無力起立、已數日未運動、决意繼續絕食、診斷舌稍乾燥、且有苔、一般情狀尚佳、脈摶八十八、牛蘭、今（七日）爲絕食之第六日、據其自述、除水外未進其他食物、彼並不覺餓、但無力起立、彼並云、現已不能看書、即其本國文字之書籍、入目時亦覺眼花撩亂、並云、除非移至上海法院審訊、决繼續絕食、診斷脈搏八十四、據哈佛大學敎授拉桑之著述、凡完全絕食者、其生命不能延長至六日或十日、但善於禁食者、若進水料、可延長至四十一日、絕食者不感痛苦、但全身感覺極度疲乏、醫士裴蘭特、七月七日、</p>
<p>▲管轄問題候解决關於牛蘭夫婦聲請移轉管轄一節、江蘇高等法院院長林彪、七日特由蘇來京、與承審該案之刑庭長黎晚及推事等商洽、八日上午已返蘇、按照刑事訴訟法、裁定移轉管轄之權、在最高法院、故江蘇高等法院不能裁定、但據另一消息、該院有將准牛蘭夫婦辯護律師陳瑛之請求、先將牛蘭夫婦送上海醫院、以便診治之說、至究否移轉管轄、則待最高法院之裁定、確否待證、</p>
<p>▲再審日期尚未定在未確定移轉管轄之前、江蘇高等法院、决仍繼續進行審判、聞該院將傳訊與該案最有關係之證人洛思、（Ｒoss）因捕獲扣蘭及開牛蘭之鐵箱時、洛思均在塲、但洛思現在青島養病、須二週後、始能返滬、至高特摩爾等·亦將傳訊、但日期尚未决定、</p>
<p>▲牛蘭遺囑已送滬牛蘭夫婦、因决心候死、故已訂立遺囑、遺囑内容、殊爲簡單、祗載明其四歲幼子托馮傑思撫養、七日已由馮傑思携往上海、牛蘭夫婦、本擬請江寗地方法院首席檢察官樓榮簽字、但樓首席以牛蘭夫婦如不幸而死、則其原因、係因其自願絕食而非病死、法院不能負責、故拒絕簽字、</p>
<h3>劉守中　考察西北實業</h3>
<p>▲劉翼飛報告察省情况</p>
<p>天津通訊、國民黨中央委員劉守中、奉命考察西北實業、抵張家口後、即訪晤察哈爾主席劉翼飛、垂詢工商敎育農礦財政情形、劉均一一報告、頃接張函述劉報告之内容、亟錄如次、足資注意西北者之參考也、</p>
<p>察省所轄、祇有十六縣、北接内外蒙古、西與綏晋兩省接壤、雖幅　遼闊、但半係沙漠、一切生產、與内地迥異、氣候寒冷、植物不豐、最普通之土地產、爲馬苓　、曾經科學家化騐、可製酒精、可惜吾國工業落後、無人注意於此、其最著之特產、即爲牛·羊·馬·駝·等家畜、然以喂養墨守舊法、不知改良、以致近年產量大减、</p>
<p>本省礦產頗富、以煤礦爲最、可惜開採者多係人工土法、出品有限、而以機器開採者、祇有兩處、產量尚豐、除供本省燃料外、並可運銷平津一帶、雞鳴山藴藏之煤尤富、此外則有龍烟鐵礦、民國元年、經農商部設爐鍊取、嗣因政變、更兼需欵浩繁、無力經營、遂告中止、今則利棄於地、國内需用鋼鐵、求於外國、良可歎也、</p>
<p>本省輸出產物、以羊毛爲大宗、惟吾國工藝不振、未能加工製造、致將此大好原料、皆運銷於歐美各國、經各國毛線工廠、加以精良製造、仍運銷吾國、祇此一項、每年漏巵、當在千萬元、昔年庫倫交通未斷時、察省最稱繁榮、自從中俄斷絕國交、庫倫之貿易、即已封鎖、以致商號相繼倒閉、市面乃日益蕭條、</p>
<p>西北交通、向賴平綏鐵路、孫中山雖有建築張多路（張家口至多倫）之計劃、惟迄未實現、以致人民智識、仍極簡陋、風氣文化、依然落後、此實交通不便之最大原因、</p>
<p>本省最高學府爲中學師範、若以提高學術造就人材論之、大學之設、刻不容緩、</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>敎育廳曾迭次籌辦大學、均以經費無着、未能遂顧、幸近年以來、各村小學校、新設三十餘處、敎育狀况、較昔已有進步、本省財政、在昔年與庫倫通商時、因稅收暢旺、尚不甚困難、又自裁釐後、全省稅收銳減、全年共收國稅不滿百萬元、地方稅約二百十餘萬元、而本省各項擔負及政費支出、年虧一百六十萬元之鉅、</p>
<p>本省面積、荒野遼闊、村鎭甚稀、對於修築鄉村道路、因欵絀實難作到、即以各縣應設之電話言之、亦多不完備、昔日裝置之電桿、今已多半腐朽、欲換新桿、無欵購置、至於興修河堤、修補市道、建築橋樑等事、或爲人民生命財產攸關、或爲觀瞻所繫、需欵雖鉅、亦不能不勉力籌辦、移東補西、誠非得己也、</p>
<p>察哈爾原爲邊陲閉塞之區、國人對之、向不注意、前曾擬有五年計劉、茲以目前財政艱窘情形觀之、恐難如期作到云云、</p>
<h3>江浙海面劃界會議</h3>
<p>▲議定以黄龍島爲界</p>
<p>實業部以江蘇浙江兩省沿海界址不明、致兩省當局對於交界地方之漁村區域管理權、時起爭執、呈部請示、實部以事關省界問題、爲免除此後糾紛起見、特咨請内政部會同派員查勘、確實訂定界址、以明行政權限、内政部准咨後、爰於本月四日在南京召集江浙兩省代表、開江浙海面劃界會議、</p>
<p>▲劃定海界出席會議者、有蘇省代表實業廳技正侯朝海等、浙省代表定海水產學校校長金炤華等、雙方當時將詳細海洋地圖披覽研究、首由浙省代表發言、謂依據宋代歷史、蘇省海州以南之洋面島嶼、均屬浙之舟山管轄、堅請仍以海州以南爲海界、蘇省代表繼起辯論、以海州爲蘇屬江北地段、明明在蘇省現行政區域之中段地點、此次會議係研究江浙兩省交界地方、俾確定詳明海界、浙代表此種主張、顯係超出會議範圍以外、雙方爭持甚久、結果劃定杭州灣口之黄龍小島爲兩省分界、以黄龍歸浙省管轄、黄龍以北爲蘇省海界、當將會議情形呈報内政部實業部備案、並分呈江蘇浙江兩省省政府、</p>
<p>▲崇明反對長江口之崇明島爲江蘇省之三等縣、該縣之海面屬地頗廣、自江北岸之北沙於十七年另設啓東縣與該縣脫離外、浙江省舟山羣島以北之各小島、如馬蹟山·洋山·泗礁山·綠華山·花烏山·大戢山·小戢山·佘山·均爲該縣所管轄、各島在海洋中、盡係漁村、漁業甚盛、泗礁並出產建築用之黄沙甚富、佘山則設有大規模之燈塔、前清設蘇淞鎭總兵、即駐節崇明、而各島爲其水師汎地、黄龍島亦屬崇明、爲一七百餘戸居民之大漁村、該縣派有警察、並設區籌備自治、每年所費不貲、此次劃界會議、竟將黄龍劃歸浙屬定海、雖另以浙之滸山白山歸蘇省管轄、作爲交換、但滸山白山均係荒島、且劃分以後、將來蘇省對於該處勦捕海盜、保護漁船、必以省界關係、軍事當局將失聯絡之效、保漁因此益感困難、故崇明縣各界認爲此事喪權辱省、已聯呈電部、請求重劃、</p>
<p>▲專家意見蘇浙兩省之爭議已如上述、遠東社記者昨特赴江蘇省立水產學校、訪該校敎授海洋學專家王喻甫張楚卿兩氏、叩以對於江浙兩省海面劃界之意見、據談、内地劃界、可以山川·地勢·民情·風俗·歷史·等爲研究之標準、今江浙兩省海面界線、應以水勢爲最適當之標準、蓋在蘇省境内有揚子江、在浙江境内有錢塘江、此兩大巨川衝入海面之水勢極大、揚子過南匯嘴·錢塘·出杭灣、揚子水濁、錢塘水清、在洋面衝接時、清濁界線井然、實爲天然之分界、而其地點、則適在黄龍島之南三哩、故當局若採用天然之水勢分界、則黄龍仍應屬蘇省云云、</p>

<p>自由談	二一技谭摩登口號  座　　三十年前的學校，科學没有完備，大槪只注重著國文英語算學三科；當時潮笑没知識没程度的少年，有這幾句口號：　　中文不識孔夫子，　　洋文不懂哀克司，　　算學不明二錢四，　　不成其爲學生子丨　辦了三十多年的敎育，科學漸形完備，當然有相當的進步了；但是，進步的固然很多，退步的却也不少，那些有名無實的男女學生，進了學校，只受了摩登化的洗禮；其它，切的一切，都可以不論不議了！他們又有這般的口號：　　中文不識孔夫子，不識也不妨，　　洋文不懂哀克司，不懂也不妨，　　算學不明二錢四，不明也不妨，　　爲了要受摩登化，方才進學堂！　　摩登兩個字，本是譯音，含有時代化的意思；要是，男女青年，注重着摩化的科學，摩登化的製造，摩登化的思想！那麽，越是摩登，越見得時代化的精神，可惜，他們的摩登，又有那般的口號；　　摩登化的科學，不用忙；　　摩登化的製造，不用忙；　　摩登化的思想，不用忙；　　忙在摩登人经的新妝！　　忙在摩登化的西裝！　　少爺學生史丹康！　　小姐學生做女皇！值得介紹之國貨工廠（一）  何躬行　　　　編者按。中華職業敎育社此次調查上海國貨工廠。費數月之時間。搜羅頗富。何君躬行。製成統計。一目瞭然。茲由本刊表而出之。亦提倡國貨之一道也。　　（一）硬科飾物工廠　　假玳　洋翠等。來自德美。成板形。每方長三尺。（闊二尺。價以磅計。以板之厚薄。色之透明。定價格之大小。大約每磅洋一元左右。俗稱硬科。）近年國人亦有能製造者。閘北有一小工廠。曰大元昌。城内老街有顧姓者。賃小樓一角。居中製造之。無牌號。蓋含有秘密性也。原料爲松香石綿樟腦等。用蒸汽溶之。候冷凝結。使成板形。　　製飾物者買之。先在硬料上繪飾物圖形。用鐵絲逐部雕出。或雕空。如舊時雕花木工狀。銷路最多者以假玳瑂一類之（軋髮）（頭箍）爲大宗。雕成方圓長及蝴蝶形各式。面上均嵌有銀星和水鑽。市價每打洋三元至四元不等。　　上項水鑽係德貨。每包一千二百料。價洋六七角。大號水鑽有每包價洋六七元者。銀星用最薄銅皮撞之。小如芥末。買以兩計。每兩洋一元左右。有自製者。用縫衣機。在裝針處。去針換以鋼模型。以銅皮承之。脚踏機動。銀星如雨而下。法至善也。　　圈軋髮頭箍。照形製就後。在其上面。依花紋先鑽小孔。後以膠水將鑽星一一嵌入。完全手工業。用磋力而已。　　上海福佑路爲該業集彙之區。廠肄林立。合計有三十餘家。如永泰昌馬鴻興永秀齋唐信昌裕明華昌等等是也。　　細察該業。似頗有發達可能。製造品類。亦有推陳出新之必要。惟現除承造一二種飾物外。只製問形賭博用之籌碼。據云銷路甚佳。幾求不應供。社會需要如是。長歎而己。　　（二）手電筒工廠　　三年來。上海製造手電筒者風起。現計有十家之多。如華德路盈豐之飛鷹牌。會文路義成之鷄牌。永興路和泰之和泰牌。北成都路昌明之三光牌。北成都路昌明之三光牌。他若德餘永豐永明耀華　華等廠。亦皆專製手電筒者也。　　查製造手電筒。係半機械手工業。其工作手續。（一）開銅片（二）滾絲（三）焊成圓筒（四）噴漆或電鍍（五）抛光（六）撞頭底（七）加銅絲及扳手（八）配玻璃及燈頭。　　上項燈頭。向係日貨。每一百價洋四元。現在上海愛麥虞限路文元坊二百另二號。有大昌明工廠。專製上項小燈頭。亦創造之國貨也。　　手電筒分三百尺。五百尺。一千尺。一千五百尺等四種。其價目。每打計洋十元十二元十八元二十元四等。古廟敲鐘錄（四七）  不除庭草齋夫　　五十一　　從此以後，國術的指導便依照張師傅所畫的路線進行，我是不斷的一一追問：（這是不是眞本領？可有武八股雜在裏面？）因爲張師傅雖是一位出類拔萃的國手，但是他的荷包裏也裝了不少的傳統觀念，我是必得帮助他像剥芭蕉樣一層一層的把　們剥掉。他是從善如流，只要我說得有理，他無不採納。因此，我們便發生了一種新希望要創造一種新國術，打破那些裝飾品的武八股。　　朱先生，江營長都加入了我們的隊伍裏來，（張師傅的方法和我們的簡直像得是一個祖宗傳下來的！）朱先生一面學鷹眼一面贊歎說。（你看，張師傅是取萬物之長以成己之長。我們人什麽事都不如畜生，只有一個長處，這個長處便是會學。人之所以爲萬物之靈就是因爲他會拜萬物做老師。若生而爲人，不肯跟萬物去學，那便成了世間之蠢物，必受天然淘汰。）空手打空拳，有些人是覺得單調。我探得農友們的心理，商得張師傅的同意，幾天内便把刀隊，槍隊，棍隊，劍隊一起成立。我們是太精明了，因爲一開始便向張師傅要秘訣。這個張師傅是有求必應。他說初學也記不得許多，每門先指點幾個字，練熟了再求上進。這是張師傅對於各隊的指點：　　（棍訣：劈，𢭪，點，撩。　　槍訣：剌，扎，抖，進。　　刀訣：攄背榻弓；盤頭裏腦。　　劍訣：描眉護膝；到手按門。）　　張師傅分隊指黭後又給了大家一個總訣。他說：（傢伙響，往裏闖！）又說：（剌劍要剌急；剌急人不知。若知剌急法，敢把敵人欺。）他的意思是：制勝之法，貴在神速，總要學得（迅雷不及掩耳）的本領纔能以巧劈力，以少敵衆。　　我自從聽了江營長說起劍比刀好，便心要學劍術。張師傅說：（你學劍也好，但不可性急。古語說：　　（一年棒，　　二年刀，　　學劍十年見分毫。）　　你要學劍，必得有恒心才行。）恒心我是有的。十年纔能學得一分一毫·那末，活到老學到老總會學成吧？玩諸掌股之上  施爲烈　　這是一段絕對的忠實紀載，告訴我這故事的朋友是向不說謊的，不過，迷信不抵抗主義的人讀了，或者以爲是故神其說罷了·　　在一月二十八的晚上，我（朋友自稱以下均仿此）突然被困在一間亭子樓中，外面的槍砲，將我的逃生之路截斷，本來，我是個膽小如鼠的弱者，這時會忽然的變成個勇往直前的健兒，我追隨在位英俊的衛士身傍，在他工作！殺敵丨的當兒，我不顧那無情的彈珠降臨，我祇竭力的襄助他：當然，木屐兒是和繡花枕一樣的，雖則穿着漂亮的軍服，佩了新式的武器，實在不堪一擊的，我們祇有個武裝軍人和一個普通的平民守在要隘上，倭奴便不能超雷池一步·　　有一天，大約是二月三日吧，我們很鎭靜地伏在沙袋下面，忽然碰碰的幾響，將死寂的空氣衝破，從沙袋的槍眼中，我們瞭望到八九個倭兵傴僂着向這邊窺探，他們想侵入我軍的陣地，填滿那貪得無厭的慾壑，可是死神在他們的面前獰笑着，好似弱者走過一個墳墓而咳幾聲壯自己的鼠膽一般，沈寂的環境裏，便發生疎落的槍聲·　　（喂，送禮的人到了，我們給他個照單全收）·我敬愛的人微笑地對我輕輕的說·雖是還不到一個星期的工夫，可是機關槍的使用，我　得些了，他一方面呌我預備，一方面效着影片裏羅克的故智，將軍帽套在槍尖上，些微地透出了沙袋，很有節次的移着，移着，果然，木屐兒的槍彈，便連珠般飛過來，他突然把槍桿跌倒，好像這裏的兵士飲彈而仆一般，倭兵門欣喜了，以爲奏功了，握住槍很迅捷地衝過來·　　計算到槍彈有相當効力的距離，他接了我的工作，將對着外面的武器搖着，一刹那間，那些野心的殘暴者，都紛紛倒地，自然，貪而又暴的人，是逃不了這裏結果的，不過，我們祇有二個人就可以將幾倍的敵人消滅，這未免太笑話了，在陣地上，我可以大膽地說，倭兵是被我們玩諸掌股之上華南墾殖塲  許晚成　　華南墾殖塲。距杭州四十里。在餘杭附近之大陽塢地方　　（華南）兩字意思，華指（中華），南指（南洋）。南洋僑胞集資爲多。　　大陽塢有山有水，山土適宜農林。塲分三處，以一二三名稱區别。面積共約二萬八千畝，環境幽雅，空氣清潤，溪水潺潺，水波不興。此地最適宜建設新農村。山上有果子如桃李梅杏梨枇杷杮等。樹木有松柏檫杉拉松樹最多，共約有一百五十萬株。老樹參天，别有景地，他若茶桑麻竹，各種蔬菜稻麥頗富，畜牧亦發達。　　居民之柴料，可由山中任意取求，鄉民生活，一任自然，殊快美云！　　此間爲富饒之地，開闢新村，發展民生，以救貧窮，實屬迫切！　　黄君警頑，主持一二八難民工廠，現汪蓉卿·張午雲·李順朝·諸公願各出資萬元·促黄君發展華南墾殖塲，聞一二八難民工廠，如有人主持，渠决前往效勞。黄君昨自大陽塢回滬，晤談如上，記之以示國人！點滴  萍　　　北伐誓師紀念，這是第六度了，憶當年廣州誓師，大軍北伐的時候，黨的聲威與黨軍的精神，確是給民衆萬分的同情，處處得民衆的愛戴與助力；所以不到兩年，就統一中國。本來這一天很值得紀念的，但如今國人受盡内亂外侮的創傷，都感覺非常悲痛與失望，悲痛是爲了北伐陣亡將士犧牲得無意義；失望是爲了國事已到不可收拾的境地，向日對於黨國所存的熱望，也由沸點隆到了冰點！　　黨治以後，平添了許多紀念日，以民衆的立塲上說這些都没有意義，只有九一八東省失地紀念，一二八淞滬抗日紀念，給我們深深地敎訓，應當記牢心田，永矢勿忘。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　言于院長難過  佛　　于右任先生爲什麽難過？因爲于先生是監察院院長，到中央黨部去出席，環顧前後左右，多係被彈劾之人，均怒目嫉視，于院長如坐針氈，殊覺難過！　　此原是于院長的不見機，亦是一般監委的不識相，因爲中央懲戒，只能懲戒薦任官吏，簡任以上官吏，就無法懲戒，一般監察委員，明知其如此，何苦結了許多空心寃家，去得罪一般中央大亨呢？　　于院長眞是一位好好先生，没有知道做官的經騐與訣竅，監院組織法，雖堂皇規定，無論何人，均得彈劾，其實這原是一篇官樣文章，不能認眞去幹，就是彈劾，亦祇能去彈劾無勢力的幾位芝麻綠荳官，丨如縣長等等丨已足夠裝了監院的塲面，你若要去彈劾幾位大亨麽？非但弄得你一點没有面子，反而弄得自己不好意思，連中央黨部不好去出席呢。　　做官的訣竅，大槪是如此，何論你什麽官，决不要認眞去做，只要馬馬虎虎罷了，倘若你能植黨營私，勾結舞弊，到也未始不可，這句話原是一個做官者從經騐中得來，于院長不曉得這樣門檻，宜其（好呌我左右爲人難）呢。　　譬如做敎員，也是如此，對於學生，千萬不可去認眞，如在上課的時候，不必定要去講課本，隨便與學生講講空頭閒話，敷衍了一點鐘，也算了事，若在考試的時候，學生偷偷地抄書本，或有學生（派司）過來或過去，你也當做不看見，這樣的敎員，學生定是歡迎，你若要認眞麽？對不起，你的飯碗恐怕難保！　　這原是一個做官的秘訣，亦是一個吃麵包的秘訣。文藝壬申四月奉母遊杭歸來賦此  陳安來　　　滄桑世事幻雲烟，古塔靈蛇已作仙，名勝也遭歐化刼，可憐風景不如前。道傳協定竟成眞，岳廟門前感慨新，嬌女無知頻笑問，墓旁長跪是何人。女兄天竺敬求神，幸得靈籤示遠因，克儉克勤應記取，不流奢侈不憂貧。涉水登山復苦吟，歸來海上夜沈沈，小人有母常離别，（家母遊杭後即回里）寸草春暉感更深。科學薄荷錠製法  沈敏　　夏天到了，我們到人多或是不甚清潔地方去，總臭到一種污氣，使人難堪，所以夏天出去，最好備點吸入劑或臭劑，這類藥品可用單方亦可用複方，種類很多，如那普塔丸Ｎaphtaline　Ball（俗稱洋樟腦丸），龍腦ＢＡorneal阿母尼亞水Ｌalution　of　Ammoia等，都有興奮作用和避菌功效，本篇所說的是吸入劑一種，因携帶便利，氣味清香，無强大剌激性，所以很受人歡迎，這就是薄荷錠，薄荷錠並且可治頭痛，從前的輸入都是Ｘ貨，現在我國藥房也自製了，他的製法很是單簡，今說其大略如后，　　（一）原料藥品薄荷腦Ｕush　Xylal樟腦Ｃmphor那普塔片Ｎaphtaline　Felakes（西藥房和工業原料店均有出售）　　（二）設備與材料　火酒燈搪瓷杯，（或熱水玻璃杯亦可）面盆，錠底木盤，（大小由各人意思而定，可向車木店定製　　如屬試騐，則用　舊木盤非可　　底盤上之圓罩、刮有圓形（大小能容納在底盤的中心），孔窩底木板，（此種模型每板二十孔或五十孔都好，孔窩上大下小，四面須光滑）。錫紙，　（三）製法用薄荷腦七十分那普塔征二十分樟腦十分（純用薄荷腦則更佳，惟價較昻，若以發售爲目的者，則以加入那普塔爲合算），放入搪瓷杯或玻璃杯中再拿此杯到預貯熱水的面盆中燉熱，使他化爲溶液，另外把錫紙撳入模型板的窩孔中，用手指摸圓。再將溶液倒入有錫紙的窩孔内，侯他冰結了。剪去餘外的錫紙，用火酒燈微烘，將木船粘上，輕輕拉出，錠劑就算做好了。因爲他有揮發性所以用木罩旋上，性的問題醜的犯罪  蓓蕾從阿Ｑ（他是我以前的同學因他名字裏有個（侃）字，故名，非未莊人也），那裏，我知道一年多未晤面的Ｃ君，因肺病在家療治，而半途放棄他已經得到很充滿了的大學學分輟讀了，　　想起這Ｃ君，確曾使我感到快慰。那時候，我們同在Ｓ校讀書，他雖比我高二級，可是我們始終同一宿舍，我向他探討過他的高深的文學意識，我也陶治過他的超然思想，他也坦白地告訴我他犯着極重的醜的罪惡，以致患了神經衰弱的色斯的里症，他說；（我自知這是最害身體的一種病徵，我極端想根本戒除，可是在無法阻止的本能的衝動時，竟逐漸的躭溺下去，肯定的意志又破裂了。）　　我還明晰地記得，在某一個下午，當我圖書館借得了所要借的書之後回到宿舍裏時所見到的一幕，是怎樣的使我驚奇Ｃ君竟這樣的大膽而肆無忌憚？　　那是一個星期六的下午，照例，本來除掉我們少數外埠住讀生因往返不便而依然住校外。本埠的寄宿生，誰也回去享受家庭所賦予的快感了，有愛人的人，也遵約去領略愛的甜蜜，即使外埠住讀生，大多數也因一星期上課的苦悶，出去看看電影，買點東西，好大一個宿舍，冷清清的眞大可享一點清福，於是在我藏書樓出來想到宿舍去乘機看幾頁書的时候，我發現房門虚掩着，而Ｃ好像在牀上有一種動作，極神秘的發出一點響聲，我脚步跨到房門外時，眞怕，Ｃ突然從很稀薄的帳子裏跳出來，眼睛火般的紅，像瘋狗似的飛奔，眞令人驚駭。他看見我了，深陷着的眼眶子，微微顯着羞慚，我一時還不知他究竟在閙什麽玩意，等到我撩開帳門發現一根圓形的研究化學盛酒精用的玻璃管時，我恍然了，我一切知道。　　他說：（不幸，又犯罪了，但幸虧你來。）　　事後，有一次敎授生理的Ｗ先生，在講到Ｓemen的變化時，我就提出質疑：（一個人在變態生理下，將怎樣去防止犯罪？）聽的同學，哄然怪呌起來，然而Ｗ先生倒很以吾言爲應發，於是說：（諸位不必這樣少見多怪，恐怕這裏犯罪的人，十個有九個半呢。只自己一諱莫如深）吧了。我勸你們這一個因循成習的醜事不要幹。）接着他詳晰地替我們一一剖白，設法。　　從此，我知道這一個青年通同犯的醜惡，是怎樣的普通而沉溺，不禁悚然自懼！　　Ｃ君終於成肺病了，焉怪呢？事實告訴我；這樣不自主，不理性，勢必要走向這條路的。　　朋友，你不是喊着想用一點力在這國難時期工作嗎？那没，請先以至高無上的理智，自己去克服這十個人有九個半犯的罪惡。因爲偉大艱苦的事業，决不是精神萎頓的人所能成就的。觸目驚心瘋人語　（續）　　（六）　　昨天我只在王公館門前望了一眼，他那看家狗便拚命的向我撲來似乎要撕碎我似的。我耐住性子問牠；（爲什要這樣的？）牠說我是奉了主人的命令的呀！）啊！原來如此，那末王老爺自己不是要整個的吞我下去嗎？　　（七）　　今天我在大馬路看見許多Ｘ國兵，一隊又一隊，一羣接上一羣，一羣後面還是一羣，他們都對我怒目嫉視，我不懂我是否成了他們的槍靶？據人說；他們是向我示威，因爲我是一個瘋人的原故。　　（八）　　萬惡的廚司問我；（許久以前縛在廚房間的小雞到那裏去了？那是老爺必需的食料。）我老實的告訴他說：（我解放了牠！）　（九）　　我親耳聽着說；他們將不給飯我吃，算是加諸我瘋人的懲罰。誠然，平心靜氣的說；（不做事的没飯吃），我不做事，所以我應該没飯吃。假如大家都能如此，那末人類的死活眞是十分公平了。　　（十）　　雖然有許多人說：（反對毆打吳大哥！）可是我却明明的知道，西街的李老板又在唆使姜流氓，賀光棍以及許多許多兇神惡煞又在第四次圍打。···　　所以說，只有將專事欺凌人的强者殺盡了天下才得太平。</p>

<h3>Scholars Discuss National Salvation 　Bin·</h3>
<p>Recently, Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, in order to study issues such as education, economy, diplomacy, and finance, specially invited more than thirty domestic (scholars) (celebrities) such as Hu Shi, Zhi Wenjiang, and Tao Xisheng to come to Beijing to hold a symposium. It is said that this gathering was only to contribute opinions from a private perspective, with an academic and expert research attitude, and was not restricted by the form of a meeting. It is extremely common for political authorities to broadly solicit public opinion, widely collect opinions, and gather scholars from all over the country to jointly discuss and exchange ideas on a certain difficult issue. The only problem is that meetings are held in name only, never implemented, and empty talk is of no practical benefit. This is a major flaw in our country's politics. There is an ancient saying that "governing does not lie in much talk." We would like to offer our views on this point.</p>
<p>Today, our country has indeed reached an extraordinary period. Speaking of the economy, it is extremely desolate; speaking of education, it is extremely corrupt; speaking of finance, it has reached a state of utter exhaustion; speaking of diplomacy, it can only be manipulated and slaughtered by others. The national situation has reached this point, and it is truly necessary to gather the wisdom of the people of the whole country to jointly seek a way to break through this extraordinary period. At the beginning, this heavy responsibility cannot be solely placed on the shoulders of a small number of political authorities. However, since the outbreak of the disaster in the Eastern Provinces, the people of the whole country have expressed their desires on how to reform domestic politics and how to establish diplomatic policies. For example, establishing clean governance, seeking self-defense and self-salvation through self-reliance, and crying out in anguish have become the unanimous voice of the country. If one says to widely collect public opinion, then that is public opinion and the will of the people. If the government can work hard based on this public opinion to seek a way to break through the current difficulties, then how could it be that it is still in a difficult situation today and cannot extricate itself? It is also strange indeed to fail to accept the true will of the people and to seek a way out for the nation through the empty talk of (scholars) (celebrities).</p>
<p>Taking meetings as an example, since the disaster in the Eastern Provinces, there has hardly been a day without meetings and discussions. Among the major ones, within the party, there have been the Unity and Peace Conference and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions. In terms of soliciting public opinion, there has also been the National Crisis Conference where "all the wise men gathered." At each meeting, resolutions and plans were established on domestic and foreign affairs. At the same time, after each meeting, the government announced to the people that there were concrete measures for both domestic and foreign affairs. However, as time passed, these so-called concrete measures were never seen in reality and were long shelved on paper. When one wakes up from a dream in the clear night, or is forced by reality, (scholars) (celebrities) are hurriedly gathered and hastily convened, and these various issues are once again submitted for discussion and research, and resolutions are established and plans are made as usual. The number of meetings increases daily, the number of plans accumulates, but the national crisis remains unchanged from beginning to end. Empty talk harms the country; things like this are common. We dare not say that it is wrong for the Executive Yuan to convene (scholars) (celebrities) today to discuss various issues. However, we dare to ask to what extent the plans resolved at the Unity and Peace Conference, the Second and Third Plenary Sessions, and the National Crisis Conference have been implemented. If the resolutions have long been thrown into the wastepaper basket and the plans have long been forgotten, then today's meeting is almost meaningless, or even close to childish play. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek recently gave a speech to the military and political leaders of various provinces in Lushan, saying that in the future, governance should be done "quickly, firmly, and practically." We now also dare to respectfully offer these words to the authorities.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is something we still cannot refrain from saying. Recently, regarding the policy of resolving the Northeast issue, there have been various rumors. Some say that the Eastern Provinces will be designated as autonomous regions. Some say that the Eastern Provinces will be jointly managed by China and Japan. Still others say that the Twenty-One Demands will be actually recognized. Although rumors need not be true, our people cannot help but be doubtful and fearful. At the same time, Mr. Hu Shi has also been invited to attend this meeting. Mr. Hu published an article on diplomatic policy towards Japan in the fifth issue of "Independent Review," putting forward nine points. The most important of these are:</p>
<p>The Chinese government should express its willingness to negotiate with Japan on the aftermath of the Three Eastern Provinces based on the five principles proposed by Japan in the League of Nations in mid-October.</p>
<p>China may as well take the initiative to propose the demilitarization of the Three Eastern Provinces. Neither China, Japan, nor Russia shall station troops in the Three Eastern Provinces.</p>
<p>Regarding the railway dispute, it should be discussed by a conference of railway experts from both countries, based on existing treaties and in accordance with the facts.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of land leases for commerce, China should demand that, under the condition of political improvement and judicial reform, Japanese subjects residing in the Three Eastern Provinces or engaged in agriculture, industry, or commerce shall not enjoy consular jurisdiction. The new treaty concluded between China and Japan should not only resolve the long-standing disputes but also look to the future and establish a foundation for the two major nations of the Far East to coexist and prosper together.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's proposal is in fact a disguised abandonment of the Eastern Provinces and an actual recognition of the Twenty-One Demands. In other words, after Zhang Xueliang's non-resistance policy led to the fall of the Northeast, a guarantee is added in the treaty. Such views of scholars, rather than being said to transcend ordinary people, are rather an obstacle to the true will of the people. Such a diplomatic plan, rather than being said to be "practical national salvation," is rather said to be a "perpetual mistake for the country." This is by no means the public opinion of our people, nor is it what our people dare to agree with. This is also what we must solemnly declare to the government authorities.</p>

If matters have to wait for a meeting to be held, opportunities are often missed. Because the capital is in Luoyang, the office remains in Beijing, and someone is assisting with military affairs in Wuhan. In addition, Beijing and Shanghai are not far apart, and many committee members often go to Shanghai to rest, so many central committee members cannot always gather in the new capital.

<h3>The Noulens Have Fallen into a Comatose State</h3>
<p>The Warden of the Detention Center Advises Them in Writing to Eat</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mr. and Mrs. Noulens have been on a hunger strike for nine days, which is the eighth day. The two of them are increasingly exhausted, their eyes are deeply sunken, and they look haggard.

Gong Bao, the warden of the detention center, drafted a written advice to Noulens today, saying that since the case has been transferred from the Military and Political Department to the court, he is unlikely to die. Even if he is sentenced to imprisonment, he can appeal, and a hunger strike is meaningless, etc. The rumor that the authorities have approved the transfer of the Noulens case to Shanghai for trial is not true.

<p>(Lausanne, 8th, by National News Agency) The Lausanne Conference convened a plenary session tonight to discuss and pass a new agreement to replace the Young Plan, scheduled for formal signing tomorrow morning. It is reported that since the armistice of the European War, countries have convened more than 40 international conferences, large and small, for the issue of reparations. Today, a final resolution has been reached, and the financial clauses of the Treaty of Versailles have been cancelled in one stroke. It is remembered that during the Versailles peace talks, the German delegation expressed its willingness to pay reparations of 10,000 trillion marks. At that time, the representatives of the Allied Powers sneered at this, ridiculing the difference as too great and immediately rejecting it. However, today, the total amount of reparations paid by Germany, including the agreed 3 billion this time, is still less than half of what they were initially willing to pay. This shows that times have changed, and all countries have been able to lower their minds and agree. After the main committee met at 4:00 p.m. today, it was decided to convene a plenary session at 9:00 p.m. that evening to read out and distribute the full text of the agreement, and to hold a final plenary session tomorrow morning, where Chairman MacDonald will deliver a closing speech and formally sign the agreement. Then, at around 6:00 p.m., the invited representatives of various countries were invited to the Pouilly-Weg Hotel to study the content of the agreement. At that time, due to the urgency of time, British experts shuttled between the invited representatives of various countries to persuade them separately, hoping to gain their approval, and they were very busy. At 9:10 p.m., the plenary session was opened to read out the full text of the agreement. Herriot, Chamberlain, and von Papen all gave speeches, praising the countries for their willingness to sacrifice and finally reach an agreement, as well as its significant impact on the world. Italian representative Mosconi praised MacDonald's tireless efforts, which finally led to success, while Belgian representative Leng Kejing praised the successful conclusion of the conference, hoping to increase world confidence. Before the speeches, representatives of Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Portugal made reservation statements, requesting that they carefully study the agreement and consult with their national governments before signing. Chairman MacDonald then declared that only the inviting countries would sign tomorrow, and the invited countries did not yet have time to study the agreement and would sign on another day. He also said that a conference would be held in the near future -- Central, please prohibit the various armies from freely recruiting troops in Hunan. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<p>Historically Significant and Worthy of Commemoration</p>
<p>The Lausanne Agreement is Formally Signed</p>
<p>Reparations Cease, Dawn of Peace</p>
<p>The Obstacle to European Recovery is Removed</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Lausanne, 8th: Tonight, the Lausanne Conference convened a plenary session to discuss the new agreement replacing the Young Plan, which was then passed. It is scheduled to be formally signed tomorrow morning. Since the armistice of the European War, international conferences, large and small, have been convened more than forty times by various countries to address the issue of reparations. Only now has a final resolution been reached, completely writing off the financial clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. It is recalled that during the Versailles peace negotiations, the German delegation expressed its willingness to pay reparations of ten trillion marks. At that time, the representatives of the Allied Powers sneered at this, ridiculing it as being too far off and immediately rejected it. However, the total amount of reparations paid by Germany today, including the three hundred billion agreed upon this time, is still less than half of what they were initially willing to pay. This shows how times have changed, and countries have been able to lower their expectations and accommodate each other. The Steering Committee held a meeting at 4 PM today and decided to convene a plenary session at 9 PM that evening to read and distribute the full text of the agreement. A final plenary session will be held tomorrow morning, with Chairman MacDonald delivering a closing speech and formally signing the agreement. At 6 PM, the invited representatives from various countries were invited to the Puliweiqi revolving restaurant to study the content of the agreement. Due to the urgency of time, British experts were working hard to communicate with the invited representatives of various countries, hoping to gain their approval. They were very busy. At 9:10 PM, the plenary session was convened, and the full text of the agreement was read. Herriot, Chamberlain, and Papen all gave speeches, praising the sacrifices made by various countries, which ultimately led to the agreement. They also emphasized the significant impact of the agreement on the world. Italian representative Mosconi praised MacDonald's tireless efforts, which ultimately led to success. Belgian representative Hymans praised the successful conclusion of the conference and hoped it would increase global trust. Before the speeches, the representatives of Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Portugal raised reservations, requesting a detailed study and consultation with their respective governments before signing. Chairman MacDonald then announced that only the inviting countries would sign tomorrow, as the invited countries did not have time to study the agreement. He said they would sign at a later date. He also stated that a meeting would be held in the near future to clear up all technical doubts. He further announced that the final session was scheduled to convene at 10 AM tomorrow morning. After speeches by various dignitaries, the meeting adjourned at 11:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Six Inviting Countries Sign the Convention</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Lausanne, 9th: At 10 AM this morning, the reparations conference held a historically memorable plenary session amidst public excitement. Gold pens were placed on the table for the six major countries to sign the agreement. Three hundred journalists gathered in the meeting hall beforehand, eagerly witnessing the final act of the conference. After the meeting began, British Foreign Secretary Simon, on behalf of the British government, read a statement declaring that the creditor nations would extend the suspension of payments until the Lausanne Agreement was ratified or any relevant country refused to ratify it. Subsequently, French Finance Minister Germain-Martin, on behalf of the French government, and Italian Foreign Minister Grandi, on behalf of the Italian government, successively read the same statement. Then, the agreement and its annexes were signed in turn by MacDonald, Runciman, Herriot, Papen, Yoshida, and Mosconi. The entire agreement was written in parallel columns of English and French, with the same meaning. Representatives from Canada, Australia, Poland successively signed. Papen finally affixed the seal of the city of Lausanne, cast in 1525, to the agreement.</p>
<h3>MacDonald's Address Carries Profound Meaning</h3>
<p>After the signing, MacDonald, in a very deep tone, delivered an address, saying, "Our work is indeed completed. We have reached a compromise after three weeks, because there are too many old events in memory, and once we want to remove them, it is more difficult than anything else. Therefore, compromise is not easy to achieve. Our work here has placed a new page in history. This is not the end of a chapter, but the starting point of a new volume. The huge amount of money imposed on one country is not a burden on two shoulders, but a pain for all countries. The burden previously imposed on Germany has disrupted world trade, affecting even far-flung places like New Zealand and Australia. Even the strong United States has been greatly affected. Public prosperity is indeed dependent on the prosperity of each individual. Europe cannot exist alone. We do not recognize building a barrier around Europe. The agreements and treaties signed here must have a response elsewhere. My hope is that a great success will be achieved in Geneva, and the wasteful spending of money on armaments will be stopped. However, disarmament is not yet ripe. We must have courage and trust among nations, and carry out moral disarmament. We must move forward until we reach the goal of peace and tranquility. The attitude taken by Germany today requires a great spirit of fearlessness. We must extend a warm hand of friendship and encourage all countries to strive to break free from the shackles of the past. We need the common work of all countries. To achieve this goal, our friends in the East must join in (MacDonald turned to the Japanese delegation at this point). Japan must join in and show loyalty to the League of Nations, as other countries do, so that we can all sit under our own fig trees and enjoy peace." The audience was deeply moved by MacDonald's simple yet profound speech. The sound of applause was deafening. After MacDonald finished speaking, Herriot distributed bouquets of flowers to the staff, secretaries, journalists, experts, and those involved in the work of the conference. MacDonald, in the end, used his chairman's gavel and declared that he had some regrets about the outcome of the conference, but he could proudly and happily leave here because of the achievements of Lausanne. The meeting adjourned at 11:25 AM. Subsequently, the Lausanne City Council presented certificates of honor to the representatives of various countries and newspapers.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Lausanne Convention</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Lausanne, 9th: Only at 1 PM yesterday did the outside world learn that the issue of reparations, which had hindered the political and economic recovery of the world after the European War, had been resolved. At that time, British Prime Minister MacDonald emerged from the venue and told reporters, "There will be very good news soon." French Prime Minister Herriot also left the meeting, extremely excited, shouting, "It's done!" At that time, there were two young ladies among the reporters, one German and one French. Herriot saw them and rushed to kiss their cheeks, expressing his joy. The agreed treaty will be called the 1932 Lausanne Convention. It consists of three parts: (1) Introduction, (2) Political Declaration, and (3) Five Resolutions. The most important part of the declaration is as follows: "The signatory countries, in order to address the various problems arising from the European War, convened a conference in Lausanne, determined to open up a new situation so that the spirit of mutual trust, peace, and friendship among the countries of the world would grow stronger. The result of the Lausanne Conference has completely ended the issue of reparations. The signatory countries do not dare to claim that this alone can guarantee the peace desired by all countries, but they hope that the peace-loving elements of Europe and the world will understand the importance of the results achieved in such hardship and difficulty, and they hope that after the Lausanne Conference, there will be new contributions, such as the united support of all countries for efforts to achieve true peace. The initial achievements can be further consolidated, but this effort must be applied to both political and economic aspects, and it must reject all possibilities of military action or force in order to be complete. The signatory countries will continue to work, in the spirit of this agreement, to seek solutions to all problems that arise now or in the future."</p>
<p>The first resolution addresses the agreement with Germany regarding the supply of bonds worth 3 billion marks. It stipulates that these bonds should be issued at 90% of their face value, with an annual interest rate of 5% and 1% set aside for reserve funds. However, these bonds cannot be issued until three years later when market conditions allow for the issuance of these bonds in accordance with the above-mentioned method. If these bonds have not been issued within fifteen years from the date of ratification, they must be cancelled. These bonds will be held by the Bank for International Settlements, dedicated to the European Relief Fund.</p>
<p>The second resolution stipulates the transitional measures for the bonds.</p>

<p>The third resolution mentions reparations other than those of Germany, stating that the five countries of Britain, Germany, France, Italy have agreed to a plan to assist Austria, which they believe is the first step towards the rehabilitation of Eastern and Southeastern Europe. This case also stipulates that the fulfillment of the reparations of Bulgaria and Hungary should be reserved until December 15th.</p>
<p>The fourth resolution stipulates that the committee should report to the organizational committee of the European Union the plans needed to eliminate the difficulties of the present day, and transfer the issue of food prices and general related issues.</p>
<p>The fifth resolution mentions the World Economic and Financial Conference, deciding that this conference will be convened by the League of Nations, the location of the conference will be decided by public vote, and it does not have to be in Geneva. It also decided to organize a committee of experts to study the financial and economic issues to be addressed by the conference. The United States is invited to send personnel to join the committee of experts.</p>
<h3>Political Annex Forbids the Use of Force</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Lausanne, 8th: The Lausanne Agreement also has a political annex, but the wording is rather ambiguous. It vaguely states that the signatory countries believe that the work of the Lausanne Conference, although extremely important and requiring huge sacrifices from all parties, cannot fully achieve lasting peace. To consolidate this work and maintain peace in political and economic aspects, all countries should henceforth prohibit the overuse of force or any form of military power.</p>
<h3>The United States Prepares to Fulfill Its Promise</h3>
<p>Considering the Issue of War Debts</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 9th: According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, the US State Department has expressed its pleasure with the Lausanne Agreement. State Department officials stated that the United States had previously allowed for a revision of debt payments to be considered when the European countries had agreed on the issue of reparations. Now the United States is ready to fulfill its promise, but the European countries must each submit their plans because the United States has always followed a policy of considering the affairs of the fifteen European debtor countries separately.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Lausanne, 9th: A warning about the procedures for debtor countries to negotiate with the United States has been transmitted from Washington. This is the most important reaction in the world to the Lausanne solution. Washington expresses the opinion that from a strategic point of view, it is unwise for debtor countries to negotiate with the United States before the US presidential election in November of this year, because this action may not only solidify the mood of opposition in Congress to debt reorganization, but will also lead the entire country in this direction. The reaction in the House of Representatives to the news of the solution can serve as clear proof. Congressman McFadden is now blaming President Hoover and the Republican Party for the loss of trillions of dollars to the United States. McFadden issued a painful statement, saying that this was the result of the United States' glorious policy of isolation. Famous American bankers view the Lausanne solution as removing a major obstacle to global recovery. However, they dare not lightly predict that the Lausanne solution will be a turning point in the midst of commercial decline.</p>
<h3>The Revival of Germany is Expected</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Lausanne, 8th: According to the Young Plan, Germany would still need to pay 11,158,920,000 marks from now until March 31, 1988. Now, under the Lausanne Agreement, it only needs to pay 3 billion marks. The difference is like heaven and earth. This cannot be said to be a major success on the road to German revival.</p>
<h3>Papen Broadcasts a Speech</h3>
<p>The National Socialist Party Still Relentlessly Criticizes</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 8th: Tonight, German Chancellor Papen broadcast a speech from Lausanne to Germany via radio. Papen stated that Germany would no longer need to make any form of tribute to any country from now on. Papen's declaration has indeed aroused the joy of the people of the whole country for the first time since the European War. Papen also declared that, according to the Young Plan, Germany should pay a huge amount of 330 billion marks in reparations. Now, this huge burden has been written off by the Lausanne Conference, and everything in the past will come to a complete end, opening a new era of European recovery and restoring world credit. This important measure can also be regarded as the restoration of Germany's international credit and the reconstruction of Germany's economic and financial autonomy, and all railways, national banks, etc. within Germany will be freed from international shackles. Papen also stated that in order to get rid of the burden of reparations, Germany has agreed to pay a total of 3 billion marks under considerable conditions that do not harm Germany's economic interests. This number represents the amount delayed in the Hoover Moratorium Plan and the European Relief Fund jointly borne by Germany and other European countries. Papen further stated that at the Lausanne Conference, the issue of responsibility for the European War and the issue of equal treatment were thoroughly discussed by the political leaders of various countries, and the time for resolution is very close. Although certain countries are unwilling to directly acknowledge the points defended by Germany, Germany's attitude has been seen and understood by all countries. Subsequently, the government will make every effort to use the international political freedom of action obtained at the Lausanne Conference to promote Germany's views and promote the realization of the immediate resolution of the above issues. Therefore, the government is deeply appreciative of the enthusiasm and determination of the people of the whole country to sincerely support it during this urgent diplomatic period.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 9th: The Berlin newspapers are harshly criticizing the Lausanne Agreement and are particularly critical of Chancellor Papen personally. Most newspapers say that Germany's debt burden has still not been released, and leading members of the National Socialist Party have even denounced the current government's consent to French conditions, demanding the overthrow of the Papen government and advocating that Germany should not be bound by the treaty signed in Lausanne. The opposition from the National Socialist Party and other parties is motivated by several factors. The main one is that when the German representatives went to the conference, they claimed that they were determined not to pay another penny, but now they are still willing to pay 3 billion marks. The Germans hoped to obtain equality in armaments, but failed to do so. Furthermore, the German representatives failed to cancel the war guilt clauses of the treaty, which is the target of public anger.</p>
<h3>British Circles Express Gratification</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, London, 8th: Today, the King of England telegraphed MacDonald, expressing his personal congratulations on the success of the Lausanne Conference.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 9th: The political and business circles in London expressed great satisfaction after hearing the news of the Lausanne Agreement, hoping that the era of dangerous war psychology would come to an end, and that the state of commercial decline might be transformed by this. British Prime Minister MacDonald worked hardest in Lausanne, repeatedly salvaging the gradually dissipating hope. Although he worked too hard and his physical strength was almost exhausted, he still勉力撐持, and would not stop until he reached his final goal. Therefore, the British people are particularly pleased that he has achieved his aspirations. The news of the resolution of the reparations issue was first told to the British government by the British Prime Minister by telephone. At that time, Colonial Minister Thomas was speaking in the House of Commons, participating in the debate on the Irish issue. Upon hearing the news, he ended his debate speech and reported the good news from Lausanne to the House of Commons.</p>
<h3>Differences and Similarities in the Feelings of France and Germany</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Paris stated that although France did not express joy at this news, it felt relieved. The French said that France had sacrificed a lot and gained nothing, but the French also congratulated Herriot for being able to take the overall situation into account. A telegram from Berlin stated that German public opinion was divided into two factions. The moderates were comforted by the fact that Germany had achieved something in this agreement. They believed that the road to world economic recovery should be opened up by this. However, the nationalists were dissatisfied with Chancellor Papen's abandonment of political demands, saying that they would reaffirm their position in the July 31st parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters telegram: The comments in the Berlin newspapers said that the Lausanne solution was gratifying in that Germany had finally been relieved of the extremely heavy burden of reparations, and disappointing in that Germany had not obtained the political concessions it had hoped for. The French newspapers all praised the success of the conference, but the right-wing newspapers mixed in criticism. The famous writer Petitna said that the value of this agreement cannot be realized immediately, because everything depends on the advance and retreat of the United States.</p>
<h3>Italy's Policy Has Been Consistent</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Rome, the Italians welcomed the Lausanne Agreement, considering it the realization of Mussolini's policy of writing off debts, which he has advocated for ten years. The Italians greatly praised the unwavering perseverance of British Prime Minister MacDonald. The Roman Papacy was also very pleased, saying that this agreement was in line with the Pope's position since 1922.</p>
<h3>Japan's Financial Difficulties</h3>
<p>Sharp Decline in Exports to China, Enormous Military Expenditures</p>
<p>The Price of Foreign Exchange Drops, Capital Continues to Flow Out</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 8th: Financial experts here, when talking to Reuters reporters, all expressed the seriousness of Japan's financial problems. It is said that the state of the national finances, the panic in the agricultural areas, and the situation in the Eastern Provinces are all extremely urgent problems. The low price of Japanese securities on foreign exchanges is enough to prove the concerns of various countries about Japan's position. Japan's imports are still more than its exports, and the authorities are very uneasy. However, some aspects say that from now on, there will be a sharp decline in imports and an increase in exports. Those engaged in the export business hope that the fall in the price of the Japanese currency will increase the demand for Japanese silk. Some Japanese cabinet members say that the exchange rate of the Japanese currency is not enough to prove Japan's true financial situation. They firmly believe that the exchange rate of the Japanese currency will gradually increase. On the other hand, influential people predict that the Japanese currency will fall to as low as 18 US cents. However, those in charge point out that this is the talk of reckless politicians and speculators. The Ministry of Finance has issued strict regulations to crack down on the outflow of capital. Without the approval of officials, capital cannot be transferred to other countries. Banks in Japan cannot accept foreign currency deposits and cannot issue foreign currency bonds without special permission. The Minister of Finance has the power to issue orders to sell various foreign securities and foreign currency deposits to the Bank of Japan, and has the power to request reports on foreign exchange and securities transactions. Commercial firms or individuals with foreign currency or foreign assets or foreign debts of 4,000 yen or more must report in detail within 30 days. How effectively this law to prevent the outflow of capital will be implemented is still uncertain. It is likely that the Ministry of Finance will be able to act at its own discretion to implement this regulation. In summary, Japan's current situation can be said to be in a state of flux. It may continue to raise debts to meet its obligations, but some quarters have doubts about whether this is appropriate.</p>
<h3>The Investigation Team Meets with the Japanese Minister of the Army</h3>
<p>Araki Expresses His Determination to Recognize the Puppet State</p>
<p>Absolutely No Interference from Third Parties Allowed</p>
<p>▲ Japan United Press, Tokyo, 9th: The Acting Chairman of the League of Nations Investigation Committee, Macartney, and members McCoy, Claudel, and Heine, along with Secretary-General Haas and five attendants, visited Army Minister Araki this morning at 10 AM for an important meeting. From the Japanese Army side, Army Minister Araki, Vice-Minister Koiso, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Yamaoka, Chief of the Military Affairs Section Yamashita, Chief of the Press Section of the Ancient City, Lieutenant Colonel Suzuki, Hisaken, Navy Colonel Tagai, Investigation Team members Ambassador Yoshida, and Secretary Tsushima attended. First, Kawasaki from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs acted as the translator. After Army Minister Araki exchanged greetings with Macartney, the Investigation Team raised the following three questions to the military: (1) The relationship between Japan's national defense and Manchuria; (2) Japan's policy on restoring security in Manchuria; (3) The future of Manchukuo and the attitude of the Japanese military towards it. Araki explained Japan's founding spirit and culture, the ideals of the people, the international relations since the Meiji Restoration, the relationship between China and Japan, the Russo-Japanese War, and Manchuria. He emphasized that Japan's national defense and Manchuria are inseparable, saying that "Japan has a responsibility to guide Manchukuo for the sake of self-defense in relation to the existence of Manchukuo. Therefore, if there is any disturbance within Manchukuo or if it is threatened from the outside, we must use sufficient awareness and strength for the sake of Japan's founding spirit and ideals. As for the timing of the withdrawal of troops, it has not yet been considered." Araki finally expressed the military's important determination, saying that "We absolutely oppose China's sovereignty extending to Manchukuo." The meeting ended at 12:25 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 9th: This morning, all members of the League of Nations Investigation Team except Lord Lytton met with Army Minister Araki for about an hour. The details of the conversation have not been announced by the authorities, but according to the newspapers this afternoon, Araki expressed the following opinions to the investigators: (1) Japan hopes to see the steady development of Manchukuo; (2) Japan will recognize Manchukuo as soon as its organization is complete; (3) Japan has not yet considered when it will withdraw its troops, as the first step must be to restore security; (4) It will never allow Manchuria to return to China; (5) Manchuria is vital to Japan's life, so Japan's defense issues and Manchuria's defense issues cannot be separated. Lord Lytton was unable to meet with Japanese government officials due to his health not being restored, but hopes to meet with the new Foreign Minister Uchida next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Japanese National Convention</h3>
<p>Urging the Government to Immediately Recognize the Northeastern Rebels</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 9th: This afternoon, a public meeting was held in Tokyo to urge the government to immediately recognize Manchukuo. Famous reactionary leaders Toyama and others attended. Subsequently, a resolution was passed, arguing that Manchukuo must be recognized immediately, and declaring that further hesitation will cause the powers to suspect Japan's lack of confidence. Representatives of the conference then presented the passed resolution drafts to the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister.</p>

<h3>Only Two Months in Office, Saito Exposes His Incompetence</h3>
<p>▲ Japan United Press, Tokyo, 9th: Since receiving the imperial command in May, Prime Minister Saito has organized a non-partisan cabinet that unites the whole country. However, personnel issues have repeatedly exposed a lack of energy, lack of vision, and a state of disunity in the cabinet. Especially when transferring local governors and replacing the governor of Karafuto, the fundamental policy regarding personnel changes was severely criticized by the Seiyukai cabinet members. Furthermore, the issue of the President of the South Manchuria Railway exposed the government's lack of control over political means in broad daylight. Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai and Minister of the Army Araki quarreled with each other over this issue. The important personnel issues that the government had decided on once again faltered. The future of the so-called coalition cabinet is quite worrying.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Succession for the President of the South Manchuria Railway</h3>
<p>Araki and Takushoku Minister Engage in Conflict</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 9th – The issue of who will succeed the President of the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) has stalled due to opposition from the military. Last night at 9 PM, Takushoku Minister Nagai visited Prime Minister Saitō to discuss a solution. He then visited Army Minister Araki to explain his recommendation of Kajiwara and seek his understanding. The Army Minister refused, proposing a new candidate for the position, urging further consideration. Minister Nagai, having secured the approval of other cabinet members, is determined to adhere to his original proposal. If it fails to pass, it will become a matter of Minister Nagai's reputation, and a major political upheaval is anticipated. The individual newly proposed by the Army Minister as the military's preferred candidate is Yoshida Toyohiko, a reserve army general and director of the Technical Headquarters.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 9th – Army Minister Araki visited Foreign Minister Uchida at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4 PM today to report on the content of his meeting with the investigation team. Afterwards, they exchanged opinions on the Mantetsu presidency issue. Both ministers agreed to oppose an immediate resolution. Upon returning to the Army Ministry, Army Minister Araki telephoned Takushoku Minister Nagai, stating that the matter was significant and should not be decided immediately, urging him to consider it further before making a decision.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 9th – Secretary-General Yamaguchi of the Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government party) visited Railway Minister Mitsuchi and Education Minister Hatoyama at 4 PM today, stating that the Seiyūkai as a whole opposes the appointment of Mr. Kajiwara as the next President of Mantetsu because he is essentially a member of the Minseitō (Constitutional Democratic Party) and not the type of person to handle an extraordinary situation. He asked them to convey these concerns to Prime Minister Saitō for consideration.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 9th – At 2 PM today, Chief Cabinet Secretary Shibata visited Prime Minister Saitō, stating that due to the military's continued strong opposition to Kajiwara's succession to the Mantetsu presidency, the issue could not be resolved quickly and suggested postponing a resolution until Monday of next week. The Prime Minister understood this sentiment.</p>
<h3>Sudden Dismissal of the Governor of Karafuto</h3>
<p>Causes Resentment Within the Seiyūkai</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 9th – Former Governor of Karafuto, Masao Kishimoto, was en route from Tokyo with his family to assume his post when he suddenly received a dismissal order. He went to the Colonization Ministry at 10:30 AM today to hand over his duties to the newly appointed Governor Imamura, and afterwards issued a statement expressing resentment at the government's inappropriate grounds for dismissal. He then visited Prime Minister Saitō at 11 AM to request an explanation for the dismissal. Prime Minister Saitō made efforts to appease him. The Seiyūkai is also deeply resentful of this sudden dismissal, and the issue appears to be escalating significantly.</p>
<h3>Political Instability Leads to Stock Market Decline</h3>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 9th – In the late afternoon session of the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, stock prices all fell due to political instability surrounding the Mantetsu presidency issue, cheap goods, and pessimism about the prospects of the disarmament conference. Near-term Shin-Toto (new eastern) stocks fell from 147 yen in the morning session to 141 yen 10 sen in the afternoon session, a decline of 5 yen 60 sen compared to yesterday's afternoon session.</p>
<h3>Poland's Request for a Loan from France</h3>
<p>For National Defense Expenses is Rejected</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin, Lausanne, 9th – According to reliable sources in France, Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski requested a loan of 300 million marks from France to expand the port of Gdynia, newly built to compete with Danzig. French Finance Minister Germain-Martin reportedly refused, stating that France had insufficient funds to meet the request.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japanese Conspiracy</h3>
<p>To Expel Soviet Influence</p>
<p>▲ Uchida Summons Li Shaogeng to Dalian to Give Instructions</p>
<p>▲ A Plot by Russians to Usurp the Soviet Position on the CER</p>
<p>▲ The Cunning Scheme of French Financial Leaders to Come to Harbin</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Li Shaogeng, the puppet superintendent of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER), along with Deputy Director-General Shen Ruilin, went to Dalian on June 28th to visit the newly appointed Japanese Foreign Minister Yasuya Uchida. It is said that Li et al. were summoned by Uchida and that Li et al. had two matters to report. One was the recent division of the 1931 net profit of the CER. Since the occupation of Shenyang last year, traffic on the routes in northern Manchuria had been blocked, but traffic on the CER remained normal, resulting in a surplus of more than 2 million gold rubles. The puppet state instructed Li Shaogeng to negotiate a prepayment of 2 million rubles in accordance with Article 1, Section 3 of the Fengtian-Russian Agreement, to be split equally between Manchuria and Russia. Manchuria would receive 1 million rubles, converted into $447,587.35, which Li Shaogeng would personally deliver to Changchun. It is said that this money has already been transferred to the hands of the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters, from which Honjo took a portion, creating 100,000 gold tickets to reward Cheng Zhiyuan's rebel army in Heilongjiang. The CER's business this year has been extremely poor. From spring to summer, it has lost more than 50,000 rubles per month. The budgeted expenditure is 37 million, but the actual revenue cannot exceed 25 million, resulting in the 1932 budget not yet being compiled. Last year's slight surplus could have been used to offset this year's losses, but it was instead split up. What is Japan's intention towards the CER? What is the Soviet Union's intention towards the CER? This is clear without saying. The other matter was the Soviet Union's constant pressure on Japan. Although they have been constantly retreating, to the point where some people already suspect that they cannot endure it any longer, the Soviet Union has actually been able to endure it. However, Japan has a desire to swallow the Northeast whole, and although the Soviet Union is retreating, it is not considered a good neighbor. Therefore, Li Shaogeng proposed at the CER Board of Directors to revise the partial Fengtian-Russian and Sino-Russian agreements in advance as a way to expel the Soviet Union and sever its relationship with the CER. This is why Li et al. went to Dalian to see Uchida. Because Li's relationship with the puppet state is relatively shallow and because of the puppet groups engaging in factionalism, they are secretly thinking of overthrowing Li et al., and Li is losing the trust of the Japanese. Recently, the Japanese have been spreading rumors that Li will resign, but Li himself has no intention of doing so. Uchida summoned him to Dalian this time, it is said, with a compromise plan, ordering Li to follow through in the Board of Directors. If Li does well, his position may not be in question, but if not, he will inevitably be squeezed out. It is said that Li met with Uchida on July 1 and returned to the puppet capital on July 2. The CER Board of Directors' new trick will be unveiled soon.</p>
<p>Before Li Shaogeng went to Dalian, one person who attracted worldwide attention came to Harbin. This was none other than Mr. Métais, the leader of the French financial community who loaned Japan 25 million in cash. Mr. Métais is currently the chairman of Banque Franco-Asiatique and the chairman of the liquidation committee of the former Russo-Asiatic Bank (i.e., the French shareholder representative of Banque de Daqing). He arrived in Harbin from Tokyo, Japan, on June 24, telling people that he planned to stay in Harbin for two months. After Mr. Métais arrived in Harbin, the Japanese began to spread rumors that Japan and France would jointly lease the CER for a term of 15 years, with an annual rent of 3.5 million yuan. However, the lease would only be limited to business rights, and Soviet employees would still be allowed to work. Japan and France plan to have Soviet and Manchurian puppet state employees each account for about 40% of all railway employees, with Japan and France accounting for 20%. Salaries and wages will still be maintained under the gold ruble system. The Soviet Union insists that Soviet and Russian railway workers account for 78%, the puppet state 13%, and Japan and France 17%. It is said that this matter has been discussed by a certain party with Slawutskij, the Soviet consul in Harbin, and the Russian side has agreed. Several days after this report was published, Mr. Métais made a statement to a White Russian reporter, saying that his visit had nothing to do with leasing the CER, but was only to represent the French shareholders of the Russo-Asiatic Bank to liquidate Banque de Daqing and to further reorganize the CER's shares. Frenchmen have invested heavily in the CER and are therefore most concerned about the CER. Whether the shares will be effective on the CER in the future is not yet clear. A definite answer can be given in a month and a half. His words have subtly revealed that France is inserting itself into the Chinese Eastern Railway through the CER's shares. Judging from Japan's recent actions towards the CER, it intends to expel the Soviet Union and prevent it from gaining a foothold in Manchuria and Mongolia. If the Soviet Union gives up the rights to the CER, there may be no dispute; otherwise, Japan will bring in France with its shareholder status, and the puppet state will speak for Japan on the surface, abolishing the Fengtian-Russian and Sino-Russian agreements, so that the Soviet Union will lose its status as a joint owner of the Chinese Eastern Railway. If the Soviet Union still does not use force to compete at this time, there is no way to maintain its CER status. Japan's plan is truly poisonous. Moreover, this strategy can both establish friendship with France, allowing France to join the CER in a private capacity without causing conflict with its prospects for operating the new colony, and also remove the Soviet Union's forces in northern Manchuria, which stand on the front line of opposition to Japan. It is not only that the forbidden fruit will not be shared by others. Mr. Métais has been very active recently. In addition to the CER's shares in France that have already been sorted out, those scattered here have been recovered by means of a method. The Soviet Union is paying close attention to this. Deputy Director-General Kuznicov originally planned to return to his country at the end of last month, but has therefore stopped. Luther, the Russian director of the Road Bureau, may return to his country recently on behalf of Kuznicov to report on this matter. Since the French have this intention, their relationship with the Japanese is even closer. This is something that our country must not neglect. (July 2nd)</p>
<h3>Harbin Merchants'</h3>
<p>Appeal Under Violence</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Military Police Conduct Midnight Raids and Arrest Innocents</p>
<p>▲ Please Ask the Puppet Government to Request the Japanese to Stop</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Japan treats Manchuria like Second Korea, so its methods are extremely cruel. Here is an official document from the Harbin Chamber of Commerce representatives of merchants to the puppet government to be forwarded to the Japanese side, describing the Japanese military police's midnight raids on people's homes and arrests of innocents. The wording is very angry. It is urgently recorded as follows, in order to see the suffering of the people of the Northeast. The letter roughly states: (Recently, in the corner of Harbin, good merchants have often been searched and arrested by Manchurian and Japanese military police for no reason. At 1 PM on the 21st of this month, several Japanese military police suddenly went to the Yanshou Tang Pharmacy at the intersection of Zhengyang Sixth Road in Fuzia Dian, tied up the person in charge, Ding Xuchu, and rummaged through the boxes and cabinets for a long time, but did not find any contraband. They then took Ding Xuchu to the Japanese Maritime Military Police Team for detention. At 1 AM on the 22nd (in the middle of the night), more than ten police officers from the Binjiang Public Security Bureau and two or three Japanese military police from Fuzia Dian came to the front gate of our Chamber of Commerce with guns and shouted at the door. The people inside the Chamber of Commerce were all awakened from their dreams. At first, they thought it was bandits robbing and were terrified and afraid to open the door. After detailed investigation, they realized that it was military police and opened the door to invite them in. The police officers asked where the Huadong Company was. The people inside the Chamber of Commerce replied that the southern side of the house was it. (Because the Huadong Fire and Water Insurance Company was founded by our Chamber of Commerce and rents the Chamber of Commerce's courtyard) The military police went over, shouted at the door and entered, searching everywhere, even digging up the roof and floor, but did not find any contraband. They still took away Li Jiexuan, the accounting director of the company, and detained him at the Japanese Military Police Detachment on Zhengyang Fourth Road in Fuzia Dian. At the same time (still in the middle of the night), another two or three Japanese military police officers, together with four or five Binjiang police officers, went to the home of Zhao Chantang (the owner of Tongji Shopping Center), a merchant on Baozhang Street, shouted at the door and entered, tied up Zhao Chantang, and searched the house, but did not find any illegal items. Later, Zhao Chantang was detained at the Binjiang Public Security Bureau. All of the people arrested above were detained for several hours or more than ten hours. Although they were all released one after another because no criminal suspicion was found, they were all good and weak merchants who suffered great fright for no reason, and their spirits were disturbed and uneasy, and they have not yet recovered. In addition to the above three cases, there are several others, but because the details are unknown, we dare not mention them. However, upon investigating the reasons for the searches and arrests in each case, it turns out that they were all reports from anonymous letters, which are the same from beginning to end. Now the entire city of Harbin is uneasy and everyone is panicked. Upon investigation, anonymous accusations cannot be effective in any country ruled by law, and even in the former Republic of China, they were all ignored, so as to prevent malicious accusations and harm to good people. Japan's rule of law is enlightened, and there is no need to discuss it. Although the establishment of Manchuria is temporary, our executive decree No. 2 first promulgated the Human Rights Protection Law, and its first article clearly stipulates that people's bodies shall not be violated. It is clear that military police, administrative and judicial organs cannot arrest people based on anonymous letters. Anonymous accusations are not something that upright people would do. They are all vicious schemes of villains to harm good people. If the official authorities actually search, arrest, and detain people based on them, even if they say that no evidence has been found and release them soon, if their bodies are arbitrarily tied up and their homes lose their security, who dares to live here for a long time? Good people will move elsewhere. In this way, there will be fewer and fewer good people and more and more bad people, making it more difficult to govern and there will be no hope for security forever. Moreover, searches and arrests mostly occur at night. No matter how frightened and helpless the people are, the situation is pitiful, and the bandits in Harbin are lurking and kidnapping in every way. It is difficult to guarantee that they will not falsely claim to be police and military police at night, knock on the door and rob. The danger is extreme. Our Chamber of Commerce is foolish and intends to request that in the future, those who report in letters of accusation must be required to sign their names and find a guarantor, search for the accused, confront and interrogate them, and investigate the truth and sit down for the false. Do not let them escape. Anonymous letters of accusation will not be accepted at all, so as to avoid false accusations. We also ask that this intention be announced to all, so as to reassure the people. The matter concerns the safety and stability of the entire city, and the hearts of the people. Our Chamber of Commerce offers this humble opinion in sincerity. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Korea: The Communist Situation is Expanding</h3>
<p>▲ Police Stations Have Reported Up to 500 People</p>
<p>Osaka Asahi Shimbun, Daegu dispatch: The Korean Communist Party, based on the Comintern's December memorandum, is attempting to resume activities. In addition to the three provinces of Gangwon, Hamgyeongbuk-do, and Pyeonganbuk-do, the ten provinces in Korea have each assigned more than 30 organizing members to connect with laborers, farmers, and small citizens and to echo comrades in Beijing, Shanghai, Vladivostok, etc., striving to incite peasant and worker uprisings and recruiting Red Guardsmen, planning for the expansion of the Communist Party. The Gyeongbuk Police Department and the Daegu Police Station conducted searches, cooperating with the Hwanghae, Gyeongnam, Hamnam, and Jeonbuk provinces, detaining as many as 500 members of the party, which is an unprecedented marvel in the history of the Korean left-wing movement.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Army</h3>
<p>Defeats Peng Bandit in Dayu</p>
<p>▲ Bandit Activity Resumes After Guangdong Army Withdraws</p>
<p>▲ Chongyou Bandit Nest Still Occupied by Bandits</p>
<p>▲ Peng Bandit Suffers a Disastrous Defeat with Over a Thousand Deaths</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After Chen Jitang of Guangdong Province withdrew the two independent brigades of Chen Zhang and Fan Dexing, who were suppressing the Red Army in the border areas of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Guidong, Suichuan, Chongyi, Shangyou, Lechang, and Renhua, the two divisions of Li Ming and Liu Shaoxian, stationed in Dafencao and Fenyi in Chongyou, because of their weak strength and the deep entrenchment of the bandits in the area, the residents were completely coerced by the bandits to bring grain into the mountains, and there was no way to purchase any supplies, and there was a risk of being attacked everywhere, so they also withdrew to Zuoan and the vicinity of Suichuan City. And the Yu Hanmou troops in southern Jiangxi, with the Zhu, Mao, and Peng factions, successively fled back from Fujian to southern Jiangxi, and the situation was serious. They also shortened the defense line. The three divisions of Ye Zhao, Zhang Mei Xin, and Li Zhenqiu were completely stationed in Nankang, Dayu, Xinfeng, and the San'nan area south of Ganzhou to secure the Guangdong border, resulting in the formerly recovered areas of Yingqian, Jieba, Guoping, and Yangmeisi being completely occupied by bandits. Fortunately, Yu Hanmou of the Guangdong Army supervised his troops and defended strictly, so that the bandits in southern and western Jiangxi could not cooperate with each other. However, the Peng bandit, because the Guangdong Army cut off its transportation lines to Yudu, Ruijin, and western Fujian, angrily concentrated its pseudo-3rd Army Corps' 3rd Army and pseudo-4th Army Corps' 7th Army, led by Zheng Bingsheng and Hou Zhongying, on the 2nd, in the area of Changlong and Yangmeisi, which borders Chongyi, Shangyou, Nankang, and Dayu, to fiercely attack Xincheng and Chijiang north of Dayu and south of Nankang, in an attempt to attack the rear of the Guangdong Army. Li Zhenqiu of the 1st Division, who was in Nankang, Ganzhou, had already received the news, so he led his troops to attack the bandits in Chijiang fiercely. Yu, the commander of Dayu, also transferred another unit to copy the bandits' rear from Chongyi, Ganzhou. The two sides attacked from both sides. Although the bandits charged fiercely, they were attacked from both sides, suffering heavy casualties, and were finally defeated by Yu's army. Yesterday, the Joint Suppression Headquarters of the three provinces received a telegram of victory, which stated: (After the Peng bandit was painfully suppressed by the National Army on the border of Jiangxi and Hunan, he led the remnants to flee to Hunan, attempting to invade Chaling and You County. They were followed by the Hunan Army and blocked by the garrison troops of Chaling and You County, and were given a heavy blow. Seeing that the plan could not succeed, the bandits fled back to Yingqian again, hoping to prolong their last gasp. Now the troops of the three provinces on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi have approached the bandit's nest. The Peng bandit is surrounded by enemies on all sides, knowing that he is exhausted, but in order to make a final struggle, he secretly fled from Yangmeisi in Chongyi to Xincheng, (the gateway to Guangdong through Dayu in Nankang) and on the morning of the 2nd, he used all his strength to attack the Guangdong Army's positions in Chijiang in Dayu County. Li, the division commander stationed there, calmly led his troops to fight back and sent another unit to attack the rear of the bandit's position. After being attacked from both sides, the bandits were panicked and fled in confusion. Division Commander Li led his troops to take the opportunity to charge and kill, killing more than 1,000 bandits and seizing 500-600 rifles. According to the captured bandits, the name of the pseudo-division commander was also killed on the spot. (July 5th)</p>
<h3>Situation of the Noulens</h3>
<p>Continuing Their Hunger Strike</p>
<p>▲ Doctors Have Administered Medicine Several Times After Examination</p>
<p>▲ Trial Date Will Be Set After Witnesses Appear in Court</p>
<p>After the Jiangsu High Court held three trials for the Noulens case, no court session was held on the 8th because additional witnesses still need to be summoned. The Noulens continued their hunger strike on the 8th. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The Noulens Continue Their Hunger Strike. Because the Noulens insist on transferring jurisdiction, they continued their hunger strike on the 8th, which is already the seventh day. Zhou Yunhui, the president of the Jiangning District Court, Lou Rong, the chief prosecutor, and Gong Kuan, the warden of the detention center, repeatedly persuaded the Noulens to eat on the 8th, and to wait for the court to rule on the jurisdiction issue, but the Noulens were unmoved. It is reported that the Noulens had been given medicine twice after being examined by doctors on the 7th. On the morning of the 8th, the court hired Xia Yuding, the president of Nanjing Hospital, to examine them, and in the afternoon, they hired Dr. Ferrant, a Western doctor from Gulou Hospital, to examine them. Medicine was administered twice successively. When Dr. Ferrant examined them, the Noulens were lying in bed, and their voices were weak and their bodies were extremely tired. At the request of the court, Dr. Ferrant strongly urged the Noulens to eat, but the two repeatedly said no. Dr. Ferrant left some medicine and powder, and the Noulens took them one after another. According to Noulens, they are now willing to prolong their lives so that the issue of transferring jurisdiction can be resolved and the trial can be held by the Shanghai Second Branch Court, but they will continue their hunger strike until it is resolved.</p>
<p>▲ Dr. Ferrant's Medical Certificate. Dr. Ferrant, an American doctor from Gulou Hospital, sent the medical certificate to the court on the 8th after examining Noulens on the 7th. The medical certificate for the 8th will be sent to the Jiangning District Court on the 9th. Gong Kuan, the warden of the detention center, will report it to the Jiangsu High Court based on this medical certificate. The medical certificate is in English, and its outline is as follows: Noulens' wife is on the sixth day of her hunger strike today (7th). According to her description, she has not eaten anything other than water, and she is unable to stand up and has not exercised for several days. She is determined to continue her hunger strike. The diagnosis is that her tongue is slightly dry and has moss, and her general condition is still good. Her pulse is 88. Noulens is on the sixth day of his hunger strike today (7th). According to his description, he has not eaten anything other than water, and he does not feel hungry, but he is unable to stand up. He also said that he can no longer read books, and even books in his own language make his eyes feel dizzy when he looks at them. He also said that he will continue his hunger strike unless he is transferred to the Shanghai Court for trial. The diagnosis is that his pulse is 84. According to Harvard University Professor Lasson's writings, those who are completely fasting cannot prolong their lives for six or ten days, but those who are good at fasting can prolong their lives for up to 41 days if they drink water. Fasters do not feel pain, but their whole body feels extremely tired. Dr. Ferrant, July 7th.</p>
<p>▲ The Jurisdiction Issue is Waiting to be Resolved. Regarding the Noulens' application for transfer of jurisdiction, Lin Biao, the president of the Jiangsu High Court, came to Beijing from Suzhou on the 7th to discuss the matter with Li Wan, the head of the criminal court in charge of the case, and the judges. He returned to Suzhou on the morning of the 8th. According to the Criminal Procedure Law, the power to decide on the transfer of jurisdiction lies with the Supreme Court, so the Jiangsu High Court cannot decide. However, according to another source, the court is said to be considering approving the request of Chen Ying, the Noulens' defense lawyer, to send the Noulens to a Shanghai hospital first for diagnosis and treatment. As for whether the jurisdiction will be transferred, it will depend on the decision of the Supreme Court. The truth remains to be seen.</p>
<p>▲ The Retrial Date Has Not Been Set. Before the transfer of jurisdiction is determined, the Jiangsu High Court has decided to continue the trial. It is reported that the court will summon Ross, the witness who is most related to the case. Ross was present when Couland was arrested and when the Noulens' iron box was opened. However, Ross is currently recuperating in Qingdao and will not be able to return to Shanghai until two weeks later. Gotemor and others will also be summoned, but the date has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>▲ The Noulens' Will Has Been Sent to Shanghai. Because the Noulens are determined to wait for death, they have made a will. The content of the will is very simple, stating only that their four-year-old son should be raised by Teufon Gediss. It was taken to Shanghai by Von Gediss on the 7th. The Noulens originally wanted to ask Lou Rong, the chief prosecutor of the Jiangning District Court, to sign it, but Chief Prosecutor Lou refused to sign, saying that if the Noulens died unfortunately, the reason would be that they voluntarily starved themselves rather than died of illness, and the court could not be responsible.</p>
<h3>平湖</h3>
<p>▲ Criminals Handed Over to County for Legal Action. The chief of Jia Village of Quan Gong Pavilion, Lu Mingzhi, secretly investigated and found that Zhou A'quan, a bandit formerly under the command of Tai Bao A'shu, had returned to his hometown. He led the local militia and captured him. He was handed over to the county government yesterday. The judge, Qu, opened court for interrogation. Due to the seriousness of the case, he was ordered to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<p>▲ Change of River Patrol Chief. Zhou Hao, the chief of the river patrol stationed in Pinghu, has been well-regarded by the locals since taking office. It is now rumored that Zhou will be promoted. Wu Jinchun has been appointed by the Civil Affairs Department to fill the position of patrol chief.</p>
<p>Incoming letter from the Vietnamese Fujian Overseas Chinese Association for National Salvation</p>
<p>Respectfully, we overseas Chinese, leaving our homes and venturing across the ocean, have experienced countless hardships in pursuit of a means to survive. Relying on our innate diligence and thrift, and our spirit of perseverance, we have accumulated wealth and possess great resources. However, if we cannot return to our homeland and remain in foreign lands for generations, how can we prevent our descendants from becoming assimilated into foreign cultures and becoming uncivilized people? In that case, the construction and management efforts of overseas Chinese will be futile, and our efforts will be worthless. The crisis of potential destruction and the seeds of decline are secretly planted. This is something our overseas Chinese cannot but be wary of and pay close attention to.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in recent times, the economies of various countries around the world have been in extreme decline. The impact has spread to Southeast Asia, causing a disastrous collapse in business and the decline of all industries. We overseas Chinese are in a precarious situation. In addition, there have been instances of anti-Chinese actions and voices heard in various places in order to protect the unemployed people of their own countries. We overseas Chinese are already in a dangerous position. In addition to uniting to survive, we must also find suitable outlets in our motherland in advance, and formulate strategies that allow us to advance and attack, and retreat and defend, so as to avoid being trapped on both sides and falling into a desperate situation. This is another thing that we overseas Chinese must be aware of.</p>
<p>However, when we turn our heads and look north to the Central Plains, we see a land full of wounds. The road home is blocked, causing heartache and tears to stain our clothes. We sigh at the vast ocean and think of our homeland under the bright moon, unable to suppress our sorrow. Speaking only of Fujian, warlords have been wantonly running rampant in recent years, leaving no piece of pure land, and the people cannot make a living. The recent intrusion of the communists has caused great pain and suffering, placing the people of Fujian in a living hell. As overseas Chinese, can we bear to sit idly by while our compatriots suffer? For the sake of our own return, how can we remain indifferent? Therefore, the emergence of a Fujian rescue group cannot be delayed. However, learning from past experiences, sending telegrams of appeal will have little effect. In the future, actions should focus on practical measures. Although Fujian support associations have been established in various ports, it is necessary to unite as one. A conference of Fujian rescue representatives from various places will soon be convened in Hong Kong to coordinate the overall plan, raise large sums of money, and send representatives back to Fujian to negotiate and carry out all tasks, in order to avoid being scattered and powerless, and merely having empty names. This is the first step in rescuing Fujian.</p>
<p>Now, the brave 19th Route Army has already entered Fujian to clear out the communists. However, being unfamiliar with the local conditions, they are easily surrounded by communist-style troops and local tyrants and evil gentry. It is imperative to send personnel to assist the army in their work, sweep away the communist atmosphere, and then work to eliminate the evil forces and establish a new administration in Fujian. This is the second step in rescuing Fujian. Both of these steps must be implemented one by one in order to achieve practical results and achieve the true goal of rescuing Fujian. Only then can the suffering of the people of Fujian be fundamentally resolved, and the overseas Chinese will have room to retreat and a clear path to return.</p>
<p>We have always admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for social undertakings and concern for national and people's livelihoods. You must have great plans for the transformation of Fujian affairs and the relief of overseas Chinese. We dare to ask for your guidance to correct our shortcomings. We sincerely value your friendship.</p>

<p>▲ Three Robberies in a Row, Victims Injured by Knives. In Panqiao Township, the third district of the county, the homes of Ye Yulin of Ye Family Residence and Gao Zhicai of Xiao Gao Family Residence were robbed in succession on the night of the 8th. When the robbers first arrived at Ye's house, the householder heard the noise and opened the door. The robbers immediately fired more than ten shots and shouted in a strong foreign accent, warning them not to make a sound. Ye Yulin's son, Junbao, firmly hugged one of the robbers, and was slashed on the left hand with a kitchen knife by a nearby robber. Junbao's wife, mother, and sister were all robbed of their gold bracelets, and their ears were slightly injured. 55 silver dollars, one bracelet, and three gold bracelets were stolen.</p>
<p>Gao Zhicai did not have much property to begin with, but because his daughter had just returned from Ningbo, the robbers noticed. The amount of jewelry stolen was not much.</p>
<p>▲ Food Management Committee Sells Rice at Reduced Price. The County Food Management Committee, due to the severe famine last year, purchased 10,000 bags of foreign rice with accumulated funds, intending to sell it to the poor at a reduced price this summer to provide relief. After the寇祸 disaster, the county's War Zone Relief Sub-Committee, seeing the wailing of the people after the looting, allocated 3,000 silver dollars from the relief funds to reduce the selling price. The committee has scheduled the sale to begin today (the 10th) at the South Warehouse. Each twenty-day period is considered one phase, and there will be a total of four phases. The quantity for each phase is three 合 per mu for each village, and two 升 per person for the urban and rural areas. Each household that suffered destruction, casualties, or death due to the寇祸 will receive an additional two 升 per person. The selling price is set at nine silver dollars per shi.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the native association of this county in Shanghai has raised relief funds in Shanghai, and there is still some remaining. 4,500 silver dollars will also be allocated to further reduce the selling price of the rice in the warehouse. Therefore, each shi will only be sold for eight silver dollars and six 角.</p>

<p>▲ Hungry Villagers in Southeastern Suburbs Arrive in Town to Seize Rice. At around 9 a.m. the day before yesterday, in Linghu Town, about 300 poor old men, women, and children from the countryside suddenly appeared. Each carrying a bag or basket, they went to various rice shops and took rice on their own. The town's Public Security Bureau and militia came forward to maintain order.

County Magistrate Li and Town Leader Sun Meizheng went to the town's Chamber of Commerce together. Unexpectedly, the hungry villagers surrounded the entire Chamber of Commerce, requesting immediate relief. County Magistrate Li immediately went to the scene and personally persuaded them to return home and wait patiently for relief. He would do his best to petition the provincial government and would come personally to provide relief as soon as a relief plan was obtained. He also gave each hungry person 20 copper coins, and the crowd dispersed.</p>
<p>It is also reported that in Shuanglin Town on the 5th of this month, 70 to 80 hungry people each brought containers for rice and went to various rice shops in the town to take rice on their own. Director Zhang of the town's Public Security Branch received the news and immediately led the police to persuade the hungry people and ordered them to go to the bureau. Each hungry person was given three 升 of white rice, and they dispersed. It is also heard that similar incidents occurred in the towns of Shanlian and Lianshi on the 4th and 5th.</p>

Unexpectedly, when the boat passed Zhangjiabu that evening, a misunderstanding occurred between him and the soldiers led by Ying Weishui of the Security Office, and they opened fire on each other. A soldier named Qiu was killed. Afterwards, the responsible parties from both sides went to the Zhangjiabu Public Security Bureau and recounted the misunderstanding. Wu and Ying then led their teams back to their original posts in Yong and Hangzhou respectively.</p>
<p>▲ Village Chief's Son Flees Back from Bandit Den. The son of Lu Azhang, the village chief of Luojiaojiao Village in the eastern district of Fenghua, was kidnapped by bandits in April of this year and has not been heard from since. His father was heartbroken and became ill with worry. Recently, his son suddenly fled back from the bandit den, and the family was overjoyed. According to him, the bandit den was in the mountains near Xikou in Fenghua. He took the risk of escaping while the bandits were asleep in the dark.</p>

The 55th Division stationed in Fei received a telegram yesterday from Shucheng on the 29th, stating that the 28th Regiment of the First Division had captured Sujiabu, the old nest of the Su Zizhi government. The original telegram reads as follows: "After the Hu Zongnan Department of the First Division recovered Qingshan Town, the right-wing army advanced on Sujiabu, which had been occupied by the Red Bandits for many years and where a puppet Soviet government was established. The fighting was fierce, and the town was occupied at noon. The Red Bandits fled westward, with countless casualties. The important secret documents of the puppet Soviet government were mostly not taken out. Troops are being dispatched to pursue them while arranging for the aftermath. After the 7th and 12th Divisions arrived in Liuan, Army Commander Wang Jun also arrived in Liucheng on the 27th, where he was warmly welcomed. Army Commander Wang Jun, believing that the Red Bandits had fled far away, opened the southeastern city to facilitate travel and ordered the Chamber of Commerce to open for business.

<p>Professors' Association of Various Universities in Shanghai</p>
<p>Declaration on the Current Situation at Zhongda University</p>
<p>The Shanghai Professors' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association (referred to as the Professors' Association) convened a board meeting to discuss the recent student unrest at Zhongda University, and issued the following declaration as a result:</p>
<p>The current unrest at Zhongda University was caused by the injury of Acting President Duan Cipeng by students. As a result, the government dissolved the entire university and dismissed all professors. Most students have been forced to leave the university, and a few have been arrested. All professors are still demanding salaries from the government. We, who serve in education, feel deeply moved and cannot help but express our serious views on this major issue:</p>
<p>(1) We believe that the government's appointment of Duan as acting president was inappropriate. In recent years, bureaucracy and factional forces have infiltrated the pure education field, leading to endless disputes. For the sake of national education, the government should avoid such erroneous policies and preserve a line of vitality for the country. The government first accepted the students' demands, but then suddenly appointed Duan Xipeng, the vice minister of education, as acting president, contradicting itself and repeating mistakes.</p>
<p>(2) We believe that the act of a few students using violence and injuring the acting president was barbaric and excessive. We are deeply saddened and advocate handling the matter according to the law. We oppose indiscriminate arrests, which allow the guilty to go unpunished and imprison the innocent. It should be noted that while it is illegal for students to act rashly and assault others, it is also illegal for the government to arbitrarily arrest people.</p>
<p>(3) We believe that the government's decision to dissolve the entire university and dismiss all professors was excessive. The misbehavior of a few students could have been resolved by punishing them according to the law. Why dissolve the entire university, sacrificing the education of most students and leaving them displaced? Why involve all the professors and allow the sacred cause of education to be interrupted by the authorities' whims?</p>
<p>(4) We believe that the issue of the former president of Zhongda University, Zhu Jiahua, now the Minister of Education, embezzling flood relief funds should be thoroughly investigated. We absolutely do not allow for perfunctory handling. As a professor of the highest national university, one cannot casually damage the reputation of others. As the head of the highest national education administration, one should not have the despicable act of embezzling funds. If the investigation reveals that Zhu Jiahua did indeed embezzle funds, he should be severely punished as a warning to those who are corrupt. If it is completely fabricated, the professor should be punished for false accusation. This matter is of great importance to the government's credibility and public sentiment. If the government does not thoroughly investigate and reveal the truth, it will be either shielding corruption or condoning slander.</p>
<p>(5) We believe that the demand of the Zhongda University professors to fulfill their employment contracts and pay their salaries is a reasonable action. Zhongda University is a national university, and the professors are personnel hired by the government. Although the government has the authority to dissolve a national university, it cannot evade its obligation to fulfill its employment contracts. If the government fails to fulfill its obligation to pay salaries, the professors have the right to disobey the government's order to take over the university. The government can breach its contract, the professors can resist the order, and the government can dissolve the university, but the professors can demand fulfillment of their employment contracts.</p>
<p>The above is purely in relation to the issue of Zhongda University. However, the student unrest at Zhongda University is merely a symptom of the overall malaise of education in the country. If the source of the disease is not fundamentally clarified, the future of education is unimaginable, and the coming of unrest may be even more severe than this. We believe that to seek remedies, the following points must be achieved at a minimum:</p>
<p>(1) Safeguard the purity of education and eliminate the intrusion of bureaucracy and factionalism. The selection of principals should be extremely cautious, and all parties should not buy or exploit young people as tools for their power struggles, so that educational institutions are not drawn into the vortex of dark politics.</p>
<p>(2) Guarantee the funding for education. The funds designated by the government should not be diverted at will. Education is the lifeline of the nation, and the authorities should know how to cherish it.</p>
<p>(3) Safeguard academic freedom. At least within universities, party-based education should not be implemented, restricting students' thinking and hindering academic progress.</p>
<p>(4) Safeguard the treatment of professors. Schools should not be treated as officialdoms, where they advance or retreat with the authorities. The salaries stipulated in the employment contracts should not be delayed.</p>
<p>General Meeting of the Labor University Faculty and Staff School Protection Association</p>
<p>▲ Report on the Process of Petitioning in Beijing</p>
<p>The Labor University faculty and staff held their fourth school protection meeting yesterday. All faculty and staff, including Li Biao, Han Yanmen, and Wang Huangyin, attended. Chen Zhenlu chaired the meeting, and Wang Chengyin served as the recorder. The meeting proceeded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Representatives who went to Beijing reported on the petitioning process. Chen Zhenlu reported that on the second day after the representatives arrived in Beijing, they hosted the capital news reporters. Reporters from all major and minor newspapers and news agencies attended. Chairman Zhang Yuanruo explained the motives for protecting the school, the achievements of Labor University, and the reasons for rejecting the Ministry of Education's decision. The reporters responded with enthusiastic applause. Zheng Fuyuan, a reporter from the Central Daily News, spoke at length and expressed the most sympathy. The representatives then went to the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education to petition. The Central Party Headquarters sent a Secretary Zhou to receive them and endorsed the petition, stating that the requests had been forwarded to the competent authorities for processing. The Executive Yuan sent Zeng Zhongming to receive them on the morning of the 5th, who stated that Minister Zhu initially intended to close Labor University, but after meeting with the founders, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and Cai Yuanpei, he changed his tone. The university will not be permanently closed, and the revival plan will be presided over by Mr. Wu Zhihui, who will form a board of directors to take more responsibility in the future, determine funding, and further consolidate the foundation of Labor University. Chu Minyi's remarks to the representatives in Beijing were consistent with the key points made by Zeng Zhongming. That afternoon, the representatives returned to the Central Hotel and immediately received a reply letter sent by Dean Wang's staff, which was satisfactory. The Ministry of Education was visited several times, but Minister Zhu was not seen, as he was dealing with the student unrest at Zhongda University. As for the founders, the representatives telegraphed Wu Zhihui in Beijing and requested Cai Yuanpei to return to Beijing. He also stated that Labor University would not be permanently closed. After returning to Shanghai, the representatives met with Li Shizeng, who immediately telegraphed Beijing to formally appoint someone responsible for the revival of Labor University. In summary, the opinions of all parties, including the Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the media, and the founders, were not only against closing Labor University, but also actively advocating for its revival, due to its labor education characteristics and the fact that Labor University is the only one of its kind in the country. Wang Chengyin then reported on the expenditure of funds for the petitioning trip to Beijing.</p>
<p>(2) Severely Repudiate the Ministry of Education's Telegram Insulting Faculty and Staff. While the Labor University representatives were petitioning in Beijing, the Ministry of Education sent a telegram to President Wang, ordering him to recall the faculty and staff and stating that some faculty and staff were in Beijing, expressing their opinions, and should be recalled immediately. During the discussion of this telegram, it was pointed out that the Faculty and Staff School Protection Association was an organization formed by the faculty and staff to protect the school, and the president had no right to interfere with their actions. The opinions expressed by the representatives in Beijing were the consensus of the faculty and staff, and it was their duty to protect the school and promote labor education. It was decided to request the Standing Committee of the School Protection Association to draft a telegram severely repudiating the Ministry of Education and to have the president send it.</p>

<p>▲Union's Petition to the Party Department:  To petition for certification that the former executive director Mr. Xu A'mei is definitely not a communist and to request the esteemed department to forward a request to the Supreme Court for a fair judgment to redress injustice.  The following is a detailed account of Mr. Xu's experiences. Mr. Xu has resided in Shanghai his whole life, living at 495 Kangti Road in the French Concession. He began working at the French Water and Electricity Company in 1922.  In 1927, the National Government promulgated the Trade Union Law. In accordance with the law, the union was approved by the Party Department's Social Affairs Bureau. Mr. Xu was then elected as a standing committee member. In 1929, due to various oppressions by the capitalists, the workers could not bear the suffering. After a resolution by all members, a request was submitted to higher authorities for mediation. However, the capitalists ultimately refused to compromise, and negotiations failed, leading to a strike. Mr. Xu, as a standing committee member, witnessing the escalating situation, believed it was not beneficial for either party. In an effort to salvage the situation, he specifically consulted with Mr. Zhang Tinghao, the third section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Mr. Du Yuesheng, among others, for a solution. As a result, both sides made concessions, signed a treaty, and work was resumed immediately.  From the day of the strike to the day the treaty was signed, it lasted only twenty-one days. Mr. Xu's efforts were crucial for this swift resolution. After the treaty was signed, the capitalists delayed in implementing it and even intensified their actions. The members, filled with righteous indignation, submitted another request to the authorities to order the capitalists to improve their treatment. The capitalists also showed no sincerity in responding and, on June 18, tightly closed the iron gates, preventing workers from entering, deliberately expanding the labor unrest. Under these circumstances, the union members had no choice but to strike again to awaken the capitalists. After fifty-seven days of stalemate, fortunately, Mr. Xu, tirelessly consulted with Central Committee member Mr. Li Shizeng, Chinese Director Du Yuesheng, City Secretary Geng Jiaji, and French Consul General Gangelin, among others, and was willing to sacrifice his own position by temporarily leaving the factory, finally resolving the labor unrest. On July 28, 1931, Mr. Xu was reinstated through the introduction of Chinese Director Du Yuesheng. Regarding union affairs, due to the election of new responsible personnel, he no longer served as an advisor. However, all the workers, because of Mr. Xu's enthusiastic service, specially requested him to assist in the standing committee affairs. On August 1 of the same year, the Central Government revised the Trade Union Law, stipulating that the workers' working hours should be eight hours in principle. The capitalists disregarded the law and delayed compliance. After several negotiations, they finally agreed to comply. Since then, the capitalists believed that these actions were instigated by Mr. Xu, and they deeply resented him, ultimately trying to find a way to harm him. However, they had no opportunity. On September 4 of the same year, workers had a conflict with the police regarding the installation of fire meters. The capitalists then instigated the police to take revenge and falsely accuse Mr. Xu, arresting him and sending him to court, where he was sentenced to ten years and six months in prison. This is the whole story. It is found that on the day of the incident, four workers were arrested. All the workers, upon hearing the news, were furious and went on strike, demanding the company to bail him out. However, Mr. Xu insisted that it was not permissible. He then arranged with Zhang Renjun, Lu Guohong, Zhang Yinsheng, and others at the Tianchan Tea House on Fourth Horse Road to discuss resuming work. These three individuals have been summoned to court by the Third Branch Court and have all unanimously stated that Mr. Xu strongly urged them to resume work. Therefore, Mr. Xu did not instigate the incident beforehand and strongly advocated for resuming work afterward. The Third Branch Court's conviction under Article 202 of the Criminal Law is clearly inappropriate. Furthermore, the main text of the judgment states that Xu A'mei organized a group with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China and sentenced him to ten years and six months of imprisonment. It is questionable whether the reactionary leaflets found by the police belonged to Mr. Xu or were planted by others as a trap. Furthermore, according to the police, these reactionary leaflets were found in Mr. Xu's bedroom, while Mr. Xu was arrested inside the New World Company. Mr. Xu neither possessed reactionary leaflets outside, nor engaged in propaganda, nor participated in illegal gatherings. His intentional conduct is manifestly obvious. Even if these leaflets belonged to Mr. Xu, according to Interpretation No. 502, it does not constitute a crime under Article 6 of the Counter-Revolutionary Punishment Law. Moreover, during a strike a few years ago, communists suddenly took the opportunity to riot. The union arrested two undesirable elements, and Mr. Xu ordered them to be sent to the Second District Police Station on Garden Road. This was reported in the local news section of the Shen Bao on July 8, 1930, and there is a record at the Public Security Bureau. If Mr. Xu were a communist, he would have tried to release them, why would he have ordered them to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for transfer? This is solid proof that Mr. Xu is definitely not a communist. Furthermore, the original judgment stated that he organized and directed the party department, how can it be called an illegal group, and how can it be said to be a group organized with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China? The original judgment has lost its basis, how can it deliberately convict an innocent person? Therefore, we provide this factual certification and implore you to review and approve it and request to forward it to the Supreme Court for a fair judgment to redress the injustice. Respectfully submitted to the Municipal Party Department.</p>
<p>National Pharmaceutical Industry Guild, Regarding the Labor Dispute Responsibility.</p>
<h3>Union to Hold General Meeting to Decide Policy</h3>
<p>The labor dispute in the national pharmaceutical industry in this city appears to be gradually easing. After the Hangzhou pharmaceutical worker representatives were rejected by the union for mediation, they have become quite passive and have stepped aside. The union is scheduled to hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss solutions. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Representatives Passive</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou pharmaceutical worker representatives Ye Zifen and Wang Yongjian sent a letter to the National Pharmaceutical Industry Guild, stating: "Respected sirs, as the saying goes, 'Heavenly principles, national laws, and human sentiments are all maxims for remedying current affairs in every stage of life.' Without further elaboration, since the Shanghai Incident on January 28, the resulting nationwide economic downturn has created a societal and national poverty problem that has alarmed and deeply saddened those who are concerned about the times. In addition, internal and external troubles are coming one after another, and the people of the nation are reflecting deeply. Internally, we must jointly seek to develop broad and abundant production, and externally, we must plan to expand trade operations in order to revitalize industry and commerce, gradually consolidate the foundation, and cultivate the social economy, which benefits the people's livelihood and is also an important policy of the authorities. However, in modern trends, the labor issue, especially between industry and commerce, is closely related to society. Therefore, the strategy for safeguarding labor issues must break through the barriers created by a few capitalists who have amassed great wealth by exploiting the blood and sweat of workers, in order to regulate all aspects of society. Should there be any emphasis or favoritism, it will undoubtedly promote disputes between labor and capital. We have learned from newspapers that the labor-capital dispute in your port is causing quite a stir in the market, and we are deeply concerned. Unexpectedly, a labor-capital dispute has also occurred with Feng Cunrentang, a member of your guild, and there is a fear that the situation will become more serious or expand day by day. Because of the friendly relationship between our association and the National Pharmaceutical Industry Guild in your port, we have specially dispatched representatives at our own expense to Shanghai to visit our colleagues and explore the truth, and if possible, to serve as mediators in a third-party capacity, which is also a necessary stage of human affairs. Moreover, when the skin is gone, what can the hair cling to? We hope to avoid serious situations above all else. Currently, the labor union of the pharmaceutical industry in your port has different views from our representatives and has consistently expressed a lack of cooperation. Therefore, third parties like us can only retreat and not interfere. In addition to sending a letter to the labor union to bid farewell, we are writing again to your association to resign. We hope you will take note of this. Sincerely, to the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Guild."</p>
<h3>Guild Statement</h3>
<p>The National Pharmaceutical Industry Guild issued a statement yesterday regarding the responsibility for this labor dispute, which was announced to all sectors of society. The original text is lengthy, so here is an excerpt of the main points: (1) The cause of this labor dispute is due to the labor side using the excuse that the capital side refused to employ substitute workers from outside. In order to safeguard social tranquility and avoid expanding the labor unrest, our association, after a five-day meeting of members, resolved to accept the item of substitute workers for a limited period. This compromise is truly a painful and unavoidable measure to cope with the environment, disregarding laws and facts. If the labor side has sincere repentance and prioritizes the people's welfare, they should deeply sympathize with the capital side's concessions and negotiate other issues in a reasonable manner. How could they become more demanding and push harder, leading to this point? Our association has received reports from members in recent days that the labor union secretly dispatched representatives to various districts to organize strike support teams and collect special donations from members, preparing for a major action. Why is this so? Since our association has accepted the preliminary condition raised by the labor side regarding the issue of substitute workers, if the labor union still recklessly disregards everything and intends to harm society by instigating a strike, all responsibility should not be related to the capital side, and the labor union should bear the blame. This is the first point that our association urgently needs to declare to society. (2) The Hangzhou pharmaceutical industry union representatives Ye and Wang made a special trip to Shanghai in the hot weather to mediate in good faith, and our association sincerely accepted their offer. Our association's executive committee member Zhang Meian exchanged opinions with Ye and Wang and the labor representatives in his personal capacity. However, the labor union resolved to reject the mediation, refusing the mediators from afar. Even when China and Japan are in conflict, friendly nations are allowed to mediate. What deep-seated hatred could there be between labor and capital in our pharmaceutical industry to cause such jealousy? Moreover, the third party's offer to mediate is purely out of good intentions, yet the labor side rejects the mediation with the same animosity. This kind of out-of-control behavior betrays trust, and the responsibility lies entirely with the labor side. This is the second point that our association urgently needs to declare to society. (3) The proceedings of our association's resolution through the general meeting are fully based on law and in accordance with orders. There is absolutely no dishonesty or selfish motive to exploit the labor side. Our sincerity and integrity can be attested by heaven and earth. The consistent stance upheld by our capital side over the years seeks legal protection. We would rather abide by the law and await death than survive through violence and coercion. The labor union's heavy oppression and various controls have been fully experienced and deeply felt by our capital side. However, even a trapped beast will fight back, and how can a human endure? The outbreak of this labor dispute is entirely the responsibility of the labor side, but our capital side will definitely exert its last effort in this environment of forced smiles. As the saying goes, "Better to be a shattered jade than an intact tile," and "burn the boats and sink the pots" is decided today. As for who is right and who is wrong in this labor dispute, it should be determined by the effectiveness of the law. This is the third point that our association urgently needs to declare to society.</p>
<h3>Union to Hold General Meeting</h3>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry labor dispute has not yet found a concrete solution. The pharmaceutical industry union is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting at the Yaowang Temple at 1:00 PM on the eleventh to discuss the direction of action, and a general meeting of members will be held on the seventeenth to decide on a solution. It is heard that the workers are fully prepared for the strike, but they will postpone it until the general meeting of members is held.</p>
<p>Electric Power Company Continues to Dismiss Workers</p>
<h3>Workers Hold Meeting to Resolve to Raise Serious Concerns</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company's manager, Hogens, previously dismissed more than 120 old workers from the Feilun Road Old Factory, causing a backlash from all the workers. The union has repeatedly petitioned party and government agencies and sent letters to the Public Works Bureau's Feixin Dun, requesting assistance, but without satisfactory results. Unexpectedly, the company has recently continued to dismiss workers, causing further indignation among all the workers. They specially convened an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss solutions. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Continued Dismissals</h3>
<p>After the electric power company dismissed a large number of workers on the first of last month, it has caused a serious backlash from the workers. The company not only does not understand the workers' suffering, but also refuses to reinstate the workers. Moreover, it has recently continued to dismiss several workers from the factory warehouse, such as Ma Jinsheng, and it is said that it will continue to dismiss workers one after another.</p>
<h3>Union Meeting</h3>
<p>The Electric Power Workers' Union, because the company continues to dismiss workers without reason, specially convened a general meeting of group leaders and representatives at the union hall at 2:30 PM yesterday, with more than 100 people attending. Chen Baogen, Ni Wenfu, Pan Genglin, Zhu Ruizhi, and Zhu Haoshen were elected as the presidium. The presidium first reported, stating that the workers are suffering from the factory's unreasonable oppression, which is becoming increasingly worse. Therefore, the workers of this factory have established a union in order to seek the workers' own interests and strive to protect all workers to resist unanimously. Then, the discussion began, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) A proposal to hold a regular general meeting of members at the union hall was resolved to be held next week. (2) A proposal to designate representatives to raise serious concerns with the company was resolved to designate Ni Wenfu, Zhu Haoshen, Fan Liren, and Gong Yuesheng. (3) Omitted. (4) A proposal to designate members of the union's economic management committee was resolved to designate Sun Fusheng, Zhu Ruizhi, Sun Yuelin, An Hongqing, and Wang Xingen. (5) A proposal to demand that the company recognize the union's right to represent all factory workers was passed. (6) A proposal that the company shall not dismiss workers without reason, and if the work is light and workers must be laid off, the factory should provide workers with six months' severance pay, and the pension should be calculated at a rate of 5% was passed. (7) A proposal that if the factory is busy and needs to recruit additional workers, unemployed workers from this factory should be given priority was passed. (8) A proposal that the company should subsidize the union's operating expenses of 500 yuan per month was passed.</p>
<p>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Telegraphs for Mori's Return to Japan</p>
<h3>Scheduled to Depart on the Eleventh</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that Mori, the secretary of the Japanese Embassy in China, was previously telegraphed by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be promoted to Consul General in Fuzhou. Mori intended to make arrangements to take office after the arrival of acting Chargé d'Affaires Yano in Shanghai. It is now learned that Mori suddenly received an urgent telegram from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, summoning him to return to Tokyo immediately to discuss diplomatic affairs. After receiving the telegram, Mori did not dare to delay and has scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan on the Nagasaki Maru on the eleventh of this month (tomorrow). He has already completed the embassy affairs and is expected to return to Shanghai in a week to complete the handover. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs's urgent recall of Mori this time is quite significant and is not without considerable relevance to Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>Water Fee Incident</p>
<h3>Correspondence Between the Real Estate Association and the Public Works Bureau</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of water fee surcharges, the British-owned Water Company suddenly notified members of the Shanghai Real Estate Association last month that the original contract would be cancelled and a new contract must be signed within a certain period. The final notice stated that if the contract was not signed as scheduled, the water supply would be stopped. The Shanghai Real Estate Association specifically sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Bureau yesterday, stating that the Water Company's actions appeared to be coercive and requested that they be stopped. A reply has been received, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Real Estate Association Letter:</p>
<p>Respected sirs, the question of whether or not to collect water fee surcharges remains unresolved. Unless those concerned specifically express their opinions, any good method can only temporarily maintain the status quo to avoid further disputes. However, last month, the British-owned Shanghai Water Company notified members of our association that the original contract would be cancelled, and if a new contract was not signed by a certain date (some set for May 31), the water supply would be stopped. Our association was quite shocked. Upon investigation, the new method of calculating water fees based on meter readings would inevitably increase the burden on the common people. If the landlords were to bear the costs, it would be difficult to implement in terms of reason, law, sentiment, and fact. We understand that your bureau has secretly commissioned a special water committee to discuss this matter, but we will not comment on that for now. However, we regret that our association has had no opportunity to express our views on the new contract signed between your bureau and the Water Company, which affects the interests of our members. The Water Company's cancellation of the original contract is based on a one-sided opinion, and threatening to cut off the water supply if the new contract is not agreed to makes the nature of this contract not a contract but an order from the authorities. Even if it is considered a contract, it is obtained through violence and coercion and is naturally invalid under the law. If a contract between a customer (landlord) and a shop (Water Company) can be freely and unilaterally cancelled by the shop, what is the sacred spirit of the contract? If your bureau, as the highest administrative authority in the city, believes that the original contract with the Water Company is unfavorable to the users it represents, it can also directly cancel it and present the Water Company with a new contract to sign. Otherwise, its monopoly will be cancelled and its business will be stopped. The Water Company will certainly not resist legally, but your bureau will certainly not dare to take this unilateral action to cancel the contract. The Water Company once claimed to have the right to handle its affairs, but if that were the case, why would it need to sign a new contract and arbitrarily handle matters? Finally, our association has an opinion that we know will be considered naive and ignorant by your bureau. However, if the common people cannot use inexpensive tap water, then we request your bureau to restore the filled-in rivers and ditches and allow residents to draw water from the rivers for use, which would also be a logical conclusion. For the sake of the public interest, we hereby write to your bureau for review and verification to benefit the people's drinking water, which is a common concern.</p>
<p>Public Works Bureau Reply:</p>
<p>Received your letter of June 27 regarding the calculation of water prices by water meter. On December 8 of last year, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association held a meeting and approved the installation of water meters. Later, Mr. Hill, an expert hired to Shanghai because of the Chinese citizens' opposition to the increase in water prices, also stated that selling water based on meter readings is a fair and reasonable method that should be adopted by those engaged in the water business. The installation of water meters is the only economical and effective way to prevent waste. When the board of directors of this bureau resolved to adopt Mr. Hill's report, it attached a statement that the water fee under the meter reading system should be differentiated to benefit the poor users. Before your association criticizes this bureau, it should give this bureau the opportunity to implement the above statement and note that the number of users to be considered in implementing this statement is not small. This is in response to your letter, and we hope you will be satisfied.</p>
<p>Fifth Day of National Salvation Propaganda Week</p>
<h3>Meeting Held Yesterday at Zhenxiu Primary School in Pudong</h3>
<h3>Held Today at Shanghai Girls' High School in Ximen</h3>
<p>The National Salvation Propaganda Week initiated by the National Salvation United Association of various groups in Xiaoximen of this city was held yesterday for the fifth day at Zhenxiu Primary School in Yangjiadu, Pudong. Over two thousand representatives from various groups and guests attended. The chairman was Chen Peide, the recorder was Yu Zhenhui, the master of ceremonies was Qian Dongye, the general affairs director was Chen Yafu, the lecture director was Zhang Tianbai, the entertainment director was Ye Huixun, the secretary-general was Song An, the chief host was Zhang Yuliang, and the chief inspector was Xu Xuezeng. The meeting began at around 1:00 PM. The chairman reported briefly, stating that for national salvation, we must automatically recognize the overall crisis and earnestly seek self-defense. Tanaka of Japan once said that he wanted to annex the whole world, and his first step was to destroy China. Now that the three northeastern provinces have been taken away, this is the first bite of the whole thing. Although China is large, it cannot withstand many bites. Everyone must think that if this place is occupied by the Japanese army, even this association cannot be opened. However, the areas where the Japanese troops have not withdrawn are not far away. If we do not thoroughly awaken, no matter when or where, there is always a danger of being occupied. We launched this propaganda week to make all the compatriots in the city and the country truly rise up to seek self-salvation. Then, Xing and Yu Zhen gave speeches, the content of which is omitted. Immediately afterward, entertainment performances and broadcast lectures began. Today, it will be held at Shanghai Girls' High School in Ximen, and the school will also participate with new dramas and dances.</p>
<p>The Pond Project Relief Association is in Urgent Need of Funds</p>
<h3>Wire Request to President Wang for Immediate Allocation</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Pond Project Relief Association sent a telegram to President Wang, stating: "President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, you are aware of the critical situation of the Jiangnan Pond Project and the safety of Shanghai Port, which have been reported repeatedly and noted by you. The funds for the various projects that this association has already started are insufficient. Please order the Ministry of Railways to remit 150,000 yuan in advance from the accumulated relief donations, which has been reported to your esteemed yuan and requested by telegram on Qi Ri. However, according to recent reports from the heads of various construction offices and local elders, in addition to the projects that this association has already started, there are new dangerous projects that must be completed within a limited time, totaling more than 1,500 zhang for both the provincial and municipal sides, which require actual labor and material costs of more than 700,000 yuan. Colleagues have repeatedly inspected these projects, and they are all real. Upon investigation, the Jiangnan Pond Project was estimated by experts to require 3 million yuan to complete all the superficial treatment projects. Now the projects that this association has already started are less than one-third of the estimated amount, so new dangerous projects will inevitably occur. After the Shanghai war, the people are impoverished and the finances are exhausted. The projects that have already started still need to raise funds to complete them. This project, which urgently needs to be continued, cannot be funded by this association. The seawall is a major national project, and according to the verified cases, the expenses are all paid from the national budget. After the great flood last year, the dikes in Jiangsu and Anhui were all granted large sums of money by the central government, plus American wheat. However, this place is a commercial port with a seawall critical to its safety, and it has not received any benefits, causing great resentment. We dare not suppress this information. We implore your esteemed yuan to quickly allocate funds so that the seawall can be permanently strengthened, and we beg you to reply by telegram first to reassure the people. Respectfully, Mu Xiangxian, Du Yong, Zhang Jiaao, Chen Huide, Lin Kanghou, Wang Zhen, Wu Yunzhai, Zhu Yinjiang, Xu Baoying, Jin Houcheng, Zhao Xi'en of the Jiangnan Pond Project Relief Association."</p>

<p>28 Incident.</p>
<p>Is it a National War?</p>
<h3>A Big Problem Caused by the Termination of a Ship Lease</h3>
<h3>Yu'an Company Sues Zhongwei Shipping Company</h3>
<p>In the January 28 Incident in Shanghai, the enemy mobilized elite troops from the army, navy, and air force to launch a fierce attack for a month. This large-scale military operation was unprecedented since the European War, shocking both China and foreign countries. Many people worried that it might be the trigger for a second world war. Unexpectedly, some people in the country who only cared about their personal interests advocated a different view, saying that this battle did not constitute a so-called national war in the legal sense. This is nothing but a delusion! This absurd and outrageous statement was made by Chen Shuntong, the manager of the Shanghai Zhongwei Shipping Company. The company had a ship called "Taiping" with a load of 3,500 tons, which Chen leased to Yu'an Shipping Company in December of last year. Both parties signed a lease agreement, stating that if China was at war with a foreign country, either party to the agreement could terminate the lease relationship unconditionally, and the prepaid funds would be settled between them. Therefore, when the January 28 Incident occurred, Zhao Yuntai, the manager of Yu'an, requested to terminate the contract and demanded the prepaid funds. Unexpectedly, Chen claimed that there was no war between the two countries. After repeated negotiations, there was no result. Yu'an then hired lawyers Yang Linzhi, Zhang Jiahui, and Ye Shaoying to sue Zhongwei Company and its manager Chen Shuntong in the Shanghai First Special District Court. In the lawsuit, they cited the facts of undeclared wars in various Western countries, as well as the writings of foreign jurists who recognized such facts as acts of war, for reference. Originally, the Japanese side's undeclared war against us this time was to avoid their responsibility as the aggressor, and their intentions were insidious, as everyone knows. Unexpectedly, Chen is still speaking up for them. Now that this issue has been brought to law, it is not only related to the outcome of the case, but also to the success or failure of future negotiations with Japan. A copy of the original complaint has been obtained and is hereby disclosed for the attention of the people of the country.</p>
<p>For the matter of terminating the contract and requesting the return of rental deposits, the plaintiff hereby states the facts and reasons for the lawsuit as follows: (Facts) On December 5, 1931, the plaintiff entered into a time transportation contract (commonly known as a long-term ship lease contract) with the defendant, stating that the defendant would provide the plaintiff with the entire "Taiping" ship, which belonged to Chinese nationality and had a load of 3,500 tons, for transportation within a period of three months from the date of delivery. Article 5 of the contract stated that the plaintiff should pay a freight fee (commonly known as ship rent) of 13,500 yuan per month. If it was less than a month, it would be calculated daily based on 30 days per month. Article 21 stated that if the ship was lost, all freight fees paid (commonly known as rent) would be calculated up to the date of the ship's loss, and the remaining amount would be returned to the plaintiff. Article 34 stated that all disputes regarding this contract should be arbitrated jointly by one person selected by the ship owner and one person selected by the shipper (commonly known as the charterer). If the arbitrators could not agree, they could jointly select a third arbitrator to arbitrate, and the result of the arbitration should be regarded as the final judgment and obeyed by both parties. Article 42 also stated that if China was at war with any country, and this contract was affected in any way, either party could terminate this contract without compensation. After the above contract was signed, the defendant delivered the above ship to the plaintiff for transportation on December 26, 1931. The plaintiff paid a month's freight fee in advance, totaling 13,500 yuan. On January 28 of this year, war suddenly broke out between China and Japan. On February 3, the plaintiff notified the defendant in accordance with the provisions of Article 42 of the contract, declaring the termination of the contract and notifying the captain that the voyage segment should be under the command of the defendant from the date of termination. Unexpectedly, the defendant refused to terminate the contract on the grounds that although there were hostile acts between China and Japan, war had not been officially declared, so it did not constitute a so-called national war in the legal sense. The plaintiff believes that whether the hostile acts between China and Japan constitute war has international law as a guideline. Therefore, the plaintiff requested the defendant to restore the original state and return the following funds, or submit to arbitration in accordance with the contract, but the defendant refused. The funds requested by the plaintiff to be returned are listed on the left: (1) The plaintiff prepaid a freight fee of 13,500 yuan, and the defendant is liable to return 23 days of freight fee from February 3 to February 26, totaling 10,350 yuan. (2) The plaintiff prepaid the ship fee, and the defendant should return 810.7 yuan. (3) The plaintiff prepaid the long smoked ship license, and the defendant should return 63.46 yuan. (4) The plaintiff prepaid 182 tons of coal, which the defendant should return, totaling 2,906.95 yuan. (5) The plaintiff prepaid the kitchen coal, which the defendant should return, totaling 19.7 yuan. The total of the above five items is 14,150.081 yuan. The above is the fact of this lawsuit. (Reason) Article 42 of the contract signed by both parties in this case states that if China is at war with any country, and this contract is affected in any way, either party may terminate this contract. As for whether the January 28 Incident constitutes a national war, there is international law that can be used as a reference. In 1813, British Judge Scott ruled on the Airey Bot ship case, citing Vanderlay's definition of war, stating, (War is a state in which a country uses force to exercise its rights, and the parties should be two independent countries). Also, American Judge Clay Hou stated, (If a country invades the territory of another country, the president not only has the right to resist by force, but also has the obligation to resist by force). Field said in his draft of international law, (National war is an act of force between two countries competing for supremacy). Brownsley said, (War is an act of self-help by force). Lawrence said, (War is an act of war by force between two public entities). According to the above, it is beyond doubt that non-independent countries are engaged in armed conflict, which constitutes a state of war. Furthermore, before two countries go to war, there are those who issue advance declarations of war or deliver letters of aid-de-camp, but there are also many cases where there are no advance warnings or declarations of war. The famous international law expert Dai Lou said that in recent international customs, a declaration of war is not a necessary act, and there can be a state of war even before a declaration of war. He also said that when Britain occupied New York in 1664, it did not first declare war on the Netherlands. Also, in the Seven Years' War, before the declaration of war, Britain had captured hundreds of French ships and thousands of people. He also said that since 1763, it has not been necessary for a country to declare war before going to war. In summary, the January 28 Incident between China and Japan constitutes a national war, which is undoubtedly the case. The plaintiff's reason for terminating the contract is justified. This is the first point. Furthermore, Article 259 of the Civil Code states that when a contract is terminated, both parties have the obligation to restore the original state, unless otherwise provided by law or stipulated in the contract, in accordance with the following provisions: (1) The items received from the other party should be returned. (2) If the payment received is money, interest should be added from the date of receipt. Since the above contract has been legally terminated, the plaintiff is entitled to request the defendant to restore the original state and return the freight, ship fee, and coal fee in accordance with the Civil Code. Therefore, the plaintiff requests a judgment ordering the defendant to return the plaintiff's freight fee, ship fee, ship license fee, and coal fee, totaling 14,150.081 yuan, plus interest at an annual rate of 5% from February 3 of this year until the date of execution. Secondly, the defendant shall bear the litigation costs. Respectfully submitted, the First Special Court, based on the complaint, immediately notified the defendant to respond in accordance with the law. When the trial opens in the future, both parties will have an extremely fierce debate on whether the January 28 Incident was a war.</p>
<p>The Chinese Ship, which has been Suspended for Half a Year, will Resume Sailing</p>
<h3>Military Transport Completed</h3>
<h3>Returned to Service</h3>
<p>After the end of the Shanghai war, Chinese ships in this port were affected by the situation and the slight adjustments in military transport. The Yangtze River and North-South Ocean ships were suspended one after another. From January of this year, almost all Chinese ships on the Yangtze River and at sea were suspended, and the losses in business for half a year were no less than several million yuan. Now, the requisitioned ships have been returned one after another, and the Chinese ships that have been suspended for half a year are now resuming operations. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Yangtze River</h3>
<p>There are more than 20 Chinese ships on the Yangtze River, belonging to three companies: China Merchants, Sanbei, and Ningshao. Last month, due to the suppression of bandits and the transfer of troops, the Ministry of Military Affairs sent personnel to Shanghai to requisition all the ships of the three companies on the Yangtze River, leaving only five ships in operation. Now that the anti-communist troops have been successively deployed to northern Anhui and Hubei, and the transportation ships have been released after repeated telegram requests from the ship bureaus, Jiangxin, Jianguo, Jiangjing, Jiangyu, Jiangda, and various Sanbei ships have returned to Shanghai from Nanjing. After minor repairs, they are scheduled to resume sailing on the Yangtze River line from tomorrow. Those that have not been released can also be released and resume operations in three or four days.</p>
<h3>Coastal</h3>
<p>After the Japanese troops withdrew, the 19th Route Army was ordered to go to Fujian to suppress the communists. The Ministry of Military Affairs telegraphed Shanghai ship bureaus to send 16 ocean-going ships to Zhenjiang and Nanjing to transport the divisions and brigades of the army to various places in Quanzhou and Xiamen. The Wanxiang, Jiahe, and Yongxing ships on the Shanghai-Fujian line and the Gongping, Yushun, Tongshan, and Xin Ningxing ships on the North-South Ocean line were completely suspended and used exclusively for military transport, which has been more than a month. Yesterday, the ships received news that the 19th Route Army can be fully loaded within a week, and the military transport merchant ships can be fully returned after the 15th of this month and resume operations on the coastal routes. The North-South Ocean ships, which have been absent for a long time, will resume operations soon.</p>
<p>Fatal Tragedy of Washing in Cold Water: Five Children Killed by Bomb</p>
<h3>A Bomb was Fished out of the River</h3>
<h3>Exploded When Hit with a Stone</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM, Shen Asi, a nineteen-year-old child from Jiangbei, led six other children, all around fourteen or fifteen years old, to wash in the cold water of a nearby stream in the thatched shed area of Yokohama Road, Baziqiao, Zhabei. Before long, one of the children found a bomb in the stream, about three inches in diameter, and took it to the river beach to play with it. Then, they hit it hard with a stone. One of them, named Sanxiao, saw this and said to the striker, "This is a bomb, don't play with it!" As soon as he finished speaking, he ran away. Before he had gone a few steps, he suddenly heard a loud explosion behind him, like a thunderclap. Five children were killed on the spot, Shen Asi was injured in the abdomen and was dying, and Shen Sanxiao was slightly injured in the hands and feet. Later, the local Public Security Bureau heard the news and went to the scene, sending them to the Tongren Hospital for treatment by car.</p>
<p>National Salvation Relief Association's Five Proposals</p>
<h3>Telegraphing the Nation</h3>
<p>To the military, civilians, and public of the entire nation. Since September 18 of last year, the violent Japanese have invaded and occupied our three provinces, creating a puppet state. The people of the country are heartbroken and cry out loudly. It has been ten months, and we are still struggling</p>
<h3>Liu Shouzhong Inspects Northwest Industries</h3>
<p>▲ Liu Yifei Reports on the Situation in the Province of Chahar</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Liu Shouzhong, member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, was ordered to inspect industries in the Northwest. After arriving in Zhangjiakou, he immediately visited Liu Yifei, Chairman of Chahar Province, inquiring about the state of industry, commerce, education, agriculture, mining, and finance. Liu reported on these matters in detail. We have now received a letter from Zhangjiakou outlining the content of Liu's report and hereby record it for the reference of those concerned with the Northwest.</p>
<p>The province of Chahar governs only sixteen counties, bordering Inner and Outer Mongolia to the north and the provinces of Suiyuan and Shanxi to the west. Although the area is vast, half of it is desert. All production is quite different from the interior. The climate is cold, and vegetation is not abundant. The most common agricultural product is potatoes, which, according to scientific testing, can be used to produce alcohol. Unfortunately, our country's industry is backward, and no one pays attention to this. The most famous special products are livestock such as cattle, sheep, horses, and camels. However, feeding methods are old-fashioned, and there is no improvement, leading to a sharp decline in production in recent years.</p>
<p>The province is rich in mineral resources, especially coal. Unfortunately, most mining is done using manual, rudimentary methods, resulting in limited output. Only two places use machinery for mining, and their output is still substantial. In addition to supplying fuel to the province, it can also be transported and sold to the areas of Beijing and Tianjin. The coal deposits in Jimingshan are particularly rich. In addition, there is the Longyan Iron Mine. In the first year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce set up furnaces to smelt iron, but due to political changes and the massive funds required, operations were halted, and the resources were abandoned. The country's demand for steel is met by foreign countries, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>The main export product of the province is wool. However, our country's craftsmanship is weak, and we are unable to process and manufacture it. As a result, this excellent raw material is all transported and sold to European and American countries. After refined manufacturing in foreign woolen mills, it is transported and sold back to our country. This single item causes a loss of at least ten million yuan each year. In the past, when trade with Kulun (present day Ulaanbaatar) was uninterrupted, Chahar Province was very prosperous. Since the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, trade with Kulun has been blocked, leading to the successive closure of businesses and a gradual decline in the market.</p>
<p>Transportation in the Northwest has always relied on the Ping-Sui Railway (Beijing-Suiyuan Railway). Although Sun Yat-sen had plans to build the Zhang-Duo Railway (Zhangjiakou to Duolun), they have not been realized to date. As a result, the people's knowledge is still very rudimentary, and customs and culture remain backward. This is truly the biggest reason for the inconvenience of transportation.</p>
<p>The highest institution of learning in the province is the middle school normal school. If we are to improve academics and cultivate talent, the establishment of a university is imperative.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>The Department of Education has repeatedly planned to establish a university, but it has been unable to do so due to a lack of funds. Fortunately, in recent years, more than thirty new village elementary schools have been established, and the state of education has improved compared to the past. In the past, when trade with Kulun was open, the province's finances were not too difficult due to brisk tax revenues. Since the abolition of the likin tax, the province's tax revenues have been sharply reduced. The total annual national tax revenue is less than one million yuan, and local tax revenue is about two million one hundred thousand yuan. However, the province's various burdens and government expenses result in a huge annual deficit of one million six hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<p>The province's area is vast and desolate, and villages and towns are very sparse. Due to a shortage of funds, it is really difficult to build rural roads. Even the telephone lines that should be installed in each county are mostly incomplete. Most of the telephone poles installed in the past are now rotten. There are no funds to purchase new poles. As for the construction of river embankments, the repair of city roads, and the construction of bridges, these are either related to the lives and property of the people or to the overall appearance of the region. Although the funds required are huge, we must still strive to raise them, shifting funds from one place to supplement another, which is truly unavoidable.</p>
<p>Chahar was originally a closed border area, and the people of the country have not paid much attention to it. Previously, a five-year plan was proposed, but given the current difficult financial situation, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Conference on Demarcating the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Sea Boundary</h3>
<p>▲ Agreement Reached to Use Huanglong Island as the Boundary</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, noting that the coastal boundary between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was unclear, has resulted in frequent disputes between the authorities of the two provinces over the administrative rights of fishing villages in the border area. The ministry has been petitioned to investigate this issue. To avoid future disputes, the Ministry of Industry specially requested the Ministry of Interior to jointly dispatch personnel to investigate and accurately define the boundary to clarify administrative authority. After approving the request, the Ministry of Interior convened representatives from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in Nanjing on the fourth of this month to hold a conference on demarcating the Jiangsu-Zhejiang sea boundary.</p>
<p>▲ Those attending the conference to demarcate the sea boundary included Hou Chaohai, a technician from the Industry Department representing Jiangsu Province, and Jin Zhaohua, the principal of the Dinghai Fisheries School, representing Zhejiang Province. Both sides thoroughly examined and studied detailed marine maps. The Zhejiang representative spoke first, stating that, according to Song Dynasty history, the ocean areas and islands south of Haizhou in Jiangsu Province all belonged to the jurisdiction of Zhoushan in Zhejiang Province. They insisted that the sea boundary should still be south of Haizhou. The Jiangsu representative then rose to debate, arguing that Haizhou is a part of Jiangbei in Jiangsu Province and is clearly in the middle of the current administrative area of Jiangsu Province. The purpose of this conference is to study the border area between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to determine a clear sea boundary. The Zhejiang representative's claim clearly exceeded the scope of the conference. After a long dispute, it was decided to demarcate the small island of Huanglong at the mouth of Hangzhou Bay as the boundary between the two provinces. Huanglong was placed under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province, and the sea area north of Huanglong was designated as the Jiangsu sea boundary. The details of the conference will be reported to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Industry for record-keeping and will also be submitted to the provincial governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>▲ Chongming Opposes. Chongming Island in the mouth of the Yangtze River is a third-class county in Jiangsu Province. The county has a vast sea area under its jurisdiction. Since Beisha on the north bank of the Yangtze River was separated from the county in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China to establish Qidong County, the small islands north of the Zhoushan Archipelago in Zhejiang Province, such as Majishan, Yangshan, Sijiaoshan, Lvhua Mountain, Huawu Mountain, Daji Mountain, Xiaoji Mountain, and Sheshan, have been under the jurisdiction of the county. All of these islands in the ocean are fishing villages with thriving fisheries. Sijiao also produces abundant yellow sand for construction. Sheshan has a large-scale lighthouse. During the Qing Dynasty, the General of the Su-Song Garrison was stationed in Chongming, and these islands were the cruising grounds of his navy. Huanglong Island also belongs to Chongming and is a large fishing village with more than seven hundred households. The county has stationed police there and is preparing for local self-government. The annual cost is not small. At this demarcation conference, Huanglong was assigned to Dinghai in Zhejiang Province, although Hushan and Baishan in Zhejiang were assigned to Jiangsu Province as an exchange. However, Hushan and Baishan are both uninhabited islands. Moreover, after the division, Jiangsu Province will lose contact with the military authorities in the future when suppressing pirates and protecting fishing boats in that area due to the provincial boundary, making it even more difficult to protect fishermen. Therefore, all sectors of Chongming County believe that this matter is a loss of rights and a humiliation to the province and have jointly sent a telegram requesting a re-demarcation.</p>
<p>▲ Expert Opinions. The dispute between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been described above. Yesterday, the reporter of the Far East News Agency specially visited Professor Wang Yufu and Zhang Chuqing, marine experts at the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries School, to ask for their opinions on the demarcation of the sea boundary between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. According to them, when demarcating boundaries on land, mountains, terrain, local customs, habits, and history can be used as standards for research. However, the sea boundary between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces should be based on water currents as the most appropriate standard. The Yangtze River is within Jiangsu Province, and the Qiantang River is within Zhejiang Province. The currents of these two great rivers flowing into the sea are extremely strong. The Yangtze River passes Nanhuizui, and the Qiantang River flows out of Hangzhou Bay. The Yangtze River is muddy, and the Qiantang River is clear. When the two rivers meet in the ocean, the clear and muddy water are distinctly separated, which is a natural boundary. And that location is exactly three miles south of Huanglong Island. Therefore, if the authorities adopt the natural water current boundary, Huanglong should still belong to Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>▲ National Economic Committee Inspects Road Construction. Zhao Zukang, an engineering specialist of the National Economic Committee, was ordered to inspect the Shanghai-Hangzhou provincial highway project. He arrived in Fengxian yesterday, taking a detour through Zhejiang. Chen Wangong of the Fengxian Engineering Office of the Construction Department and Zhou Jiuxu, the head of the local Construction Bureau, accompanied him in hired sedan chairs this morning to inspect each section of the road. The specialist also had detailed discussions on the laying of telephone lines along the road and the construction of stations. It is said that the entire route is divided into twenty-six stations. In addition to building six garages in central locations such as Nanqiao, oil depots will also be built in Minhang Duipu and Zhapu to facilitate operations. Now, in Fengxian County, the section of the road south of Nanqiao has been completed and connected to the Shanghai-Minhang South Road. Therefore, many foreigners have been taking cars from Shanghai, crossing the river, and visiting here in recent days. As for the sections of the dike along Tuolin, the roadbed has been built to near Jipu, so the entire road can be completed by September 1st at the latest.</p>
<p>▲ Fundraising Begins for Plague Emergency Treatment. The plague situation in Fengxian County is getting worse day by day, with especially many cases in the areas of Jinhui, Xuli, and Nanqiao. Therefore, County Magistrate Shen Qingchen, in order to facilitate treatment for the people, has, in addition to ordering the County Public Security Bureau and the County Clinic to immediately start emergency plague treatment, also organized an epidemic prevention team from these two agencies. Yesterday, they began going to various towns and villages to forcibly encourage vaccinations in order to prevent transmission. Regarding funding, the County Government has already convened an epidemic prevention committee to find ways to raise funds.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>▲ Robberies Recorded. The home of a resident surnamed Zhang in Nanheshangjing, Caojiawan Township, District 12 of Qingpu County, was suddenly attacked by more than twenty bandits armed with weapons late at night the other day. They broke down the door and entered the house, arbitrarily searching and looting. After about an hour, they fled with their loot, causing a loss of about three hundred yuan. Also, the home of Shen Yunting, a wealthy resident of Sikan Tou Village, Hongmiao Township, District 8, was suddenly attacked by several bandits armed with torches and sharp weapons. They pushed open the door and entered, tied up Shen, and forced him to hand over his hidden silver, taking about a thousand yuan. They also robbed the entire village for about three hours before leaving with a roar.</p>
<p>▲ Bandits Executed by Firing Squad. At 7:00 a.m. yesterday, the County Government approved the execution of two bandits, Lu Heshang and Zhang Akun, who had previously robbed in Renteng Village, Caihang, and Taozhuang in District 4, and kidnapped the son of Shen Yongru in Xisong Township in the same district. After verifying their identities, they were taken to the execution ground and executed by firing squad as a warning to the public.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>▲ Plague Worsens Outside the West Gate. Cases of cholera have been discovered inside and outside Taicang County for a week. Patients vomit, have diarrhea, and quickly turn blue, with more than ten people dying without being treated. In recent days, due to the unfavorable weather, the plague has worsened outside the West Gate and is spreading very rapidly. Yesterday (the 7th), there were more than ten cases in the Xiheyan area, with the Huang family being the most severely affected. All eight members of the family were suffering from the disease, and two had already died by the afternoon. Although the Shanghai Health Bureau has recently sent two doctors to provide free epidemic prevention injections for the public, the number of doctors is too small to meet the demand, and the villagers, with their rudimentary knowledge, are all hesitant to come forward.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>▲ Organizing an Anti-Civil War Alliance. The Wuxian Agricultural Education and Commerce Association, the Lawyers' Association, the Silver and Money Industry Association, and others held a meeting at the Beiju YMCA on the afternoon of the 9th to organize an Anti-Civil War Alliance, discussing joining the alliance and actively proceeding to awaken the entire country to resist foreign aggression together.</p>
<p>▲ Lake Bandits Continuously Rob Merchants. On the night of the 7th, thirty lake bandits suddenly attacked Pochegang in District 10 of Wujiang County, continuously robbing merchants Yu Xiesheng, Yu Bingyin, Zhu Fengtian, Ge Yongjiao, and others. The bandits also shot and wounded Zhao Taifang, the owner of one of the stores. The 14th Water Public Security Team has reportedly departed to pursue and suppress the bandits. In addition, the 3rd Water Public Security Office stationed in Suzhou has reported that Geng Mazi, a bandit from Anhui, is privately transporting a large quantity of military cotton into West Taihu, preparing to launch a large-scale uprising in the Sanshan and Zeshan areas. Shen Gaozhen, the district chief, decided to lead the 11th Team to depart on the 9th to search and suppress the bandits. At the same time, the Suzhou-Songjiang Bandit Suppression Headquarters, due to the rampant banditry in Dianshan Lake, has scheduled a meeting for the afternoon of the 12th to convene the magistrates of the four related counties of Wuxian, Wujiang, Kunshan, and Qingpu to discuss suppression measures.</p>
<p>▲ Actively Expanding Long-Distance Telephone Service. The Provincial Construction Department intends to reconnect with six counties in Jiangbei, including Yangzhou, in order to actively expand long-distance telephone service in the ten counties of Jiangnan. It is currently preparing to lay an underwater cable across the Yangtze River. As soon as the installation is complete, formal telephone service can be implemented.</p>
<p>▲ Plague Rampant in Suzhou. The plague has been rampant in Suzhou in recent days, with as many as fifty or sixty deaths, especially in the northern part of the city. The County Government and other agencies plan to convene a meeting of the Public Security Bureau and various hospitals to discuss prevention and control measures.</p>
<p>▲ Rent Maintained at Original Level. County Magistrate Zou went to Beijing to request instructions on special business tax and rent issues. He returned to Suzhou yesterday. According to him, the province has decided to stop collecting the special business tax and will reorganize the ordinary tax. Rent will be maintained at the original level and actively collected. The Rent Solicitation Committee decided yesterday to continue to have the Public Security and Finance Bureaus responsible for the collection and to consult with local people to persuade them to pay.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Residents Return to Suzhou. The Japanese residents have now returned to Suzhou led by Kawanami, a representative from the Japanese Consulate. A total of twenty-eight people were escorted to the concession under the protection of the Gendarmerie Corps and the Public Security Bureau. Kawanami visited various agencies yesterday to pay his respects.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>▲ The Provincial Government Orders Haimen Private Middle School to Stop Examinations. This spring, a strike by students happened at Haimen Private Middle School, which lingered for over a month before it was resolved. The newly appointed Principal Tang Fan Di is now holding examinations for all grades to prepare for promotion or graduation. Yesterday, the Department of Education instructed the county that the school has too many missed classes and should seek remediation, not promotion or graduation, and ordered the cessation of examinations. The more than three hundred students of Haimen Middle School were shocked and frightened upon receiving the order. Yesterday (the 5th), they sent representatives to the Provincial Department of Education to petition for remediation.</p>
<p>▲ Opening of Special Agent Training Class. The County Defense Association was ordered to open a special agent training class for the Defense Corps and preparations are now complete. Yesterday the sixth meeting of the Defense Committee was held, deciding on eighteen important cases. Regarding the special agent training class, it was decided that all districts must send the trainees before July 10th, and the training class will officially open on July 15th.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲ Jiangsu Province Decides to Reorganize Business Tax. The Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly appealed to the Provincial Government regarding the special business tax issue. After a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on the 6th, it was decided that the special business tax proposed by the provincial government had been explicitly revoked by the Central Government, and that the proposal to suspend the business tax and replace it with a business license tax had no legal basis. Now that the province insists on continuing to collect the business tax, the Chamber of Commerce should agree, and five key points were decided: (1) The original tax rate of 1/1000 will be changed to 2/1000; (2) The original tax rate of 2/1000 will be changed to a maximum of 4/1000; (3) The original tax rate of 4/1000 or higher will remain unchanged; (4) Charitable causes will be taxed at half the rate; (5) The above five points will be implemented starting in the autumn of the 21st year of the Republic of China. The above five points were discussed with the provincial government by Yu Xiaochuan, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. Chairman Gu has expressed his approval in principle. However, the province's budget is still largely insufficient and advocates for following the Zhejiang Province method, taxing all businesses based on their turnover with a starting point of 5/1000. On the 7th, the members of the Chamber of Commerce continued the meeting and decided: (1) The government should reorganize and manage the original business tax, and the county chambers of commerce should assist in the process; (2) Request the government to have the Finance Bureau directly collect the tax, without establishing a separate bureau, to save expenses; (3) The gold and silver industry should be taxed according to its capital; (4) The chambers of commerce in the old prefectures are allowed to separately invite chambers of commerce from each prefecture to convene a meeting to decide on the implementation before the 20th of this month. After the above decisions, the opinions of officials and merchants have largely converged. However, the provincial government convened a joint meeting of the members of the Chamber of Commerce yesterday (the 8th) to jointly decide on how to stipulate the tax rate and how to improve the collection method.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>▲ Kidnapped Victim From Shazhou Commits Suicide. On the morning of the 16th of last month, at 3:00 a.m., more than twenty sea pirates suddenly attacked the Xiaosha area of Changyinsha in the Nansha District. They first tied up six members of the town's defense corps and confiscated their firearms. Then, they went to the Dexin Company in the Shierwei Port and kidnapped the manager, Liu Defeng, and three female servants. At the beginning of this month, the Liu family received a letter from Shanghai sent by the bandits demanding a ransom of 100,000 yuan. However, although Liu was well-off, how could he produce such a huge sum? His family was in distress day and night holding the letter. One night, Liu's wife suddenly discovered hidden writing in the blank spaces of the letter, presumably written secretly by Defeng to avoid the bandits' attention. The content was roughly as follows: "Since I was kidnapped by the bandits, I have been hiding day and night in the lower cabin of the bandit ship, dark and without sunlight, eating, sleeping, and relieving myself here, filthy and stinking beyond description. The boat sometimes moves and sometimes stops, and storms occur from time to time, tossing me about terribly, making me suffer unspeakably. Whenever the bandits are in the mood, they tie me with ropes and beat me with whips and bamboo sticks, which is almost routine, leaving me covered in bruises, which is unbearable. The most hateful thing is that the bandits keep pressing me for details about my family's property." Since I have nothing to answer, they beat my toes with hammers, causing serious injuries everywhere, making it difficult for me to move. My family's property is only enough to keep us warm and fed. Since I cannot move anymore and cannot contribute to my family and country, there is no need to prepare a ransom." The family was shocked and saddened. Since there was no way to raise the ransom, they could only resign themselves to fate. It was rumored earlier that Liu Defeng had committed suicide in the bandit den because he could not bear the abuse, but this could not be confirmed for a while. Yesterday, Liu's body was suddenly discovered on the beach in the Xiasha area, apparently by hanging. The local villagers informed the Liu family to collect the body. It was found that Liu's body was covered in bruises.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>▲ Criminals Arrested in Robbery and Murder Case. The home of Chen Yugeng in Gaomei Township, District 7 of Wujin County, was previously robbed, and Chen was injured by the bandits. He later died in Wujin Hospital. At the same time, the home of Feng Xinghe in the same district was also robbed. Afterwards, after Detective Team Leader Ni Gusheng of the County Government investigated everywhere, a key suspect named Wei Genda was captured in disguise in Futai Township. He confessed to the robbery and revealed how the criminals involved in the case came up with the idea. He was sent to the county for interrogation on the 8th.</p>
<p>▲ Cholera Outbreak Unusually Rampant. Cholera has been prevalent in Wujin County recently and the situation is rampant. On the 8th, Chen Baosai, Fang Shengcai, Zhou Rongjin, Jiang Zhenshu and four other people were sent to Wujin Hospital for emergency treatment. Among them, Zhou and Fang were in serious condition.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>▲ Deadline for Demolition of Buildings on Zhongshan Road. The Construction Department of Jiangsu Province is building the first section of Zhongshan Road from the West Gate Station through Nanma Road Square to Luzhou Guild Hall Lane, and another section of the road from the Square to Baixian Park. Previously, a notice had been issued setting a deadline for the demolition of buildings and obstacles along the road. Later, residents requested a change of route. The Construction Department stated that the route had been determined by the former Construction Engineering Office last year and submitted to the Provincial Government for approval and record-keeping. The demolition line had been determined. This time, the route was carefully studied again and it was felt that the original route was not inappropriate and was in line with the principles of modern urban planning. A route map was drawn and submitted to the Provincial Government for approval. The Provincial Government decided at a meeting to proceed according to the original plan and ordered the Construction Department to implement it faithfully. Now, after receiving this instruction, the Construction Department issued a notice today ordering the residents and merchants along the relevant sections of the road to demolish all the buildings within the demolition line that have not been demolished by the 16th of this month. If they fail to demolish within the deadline, workers will be hired to demolish them, and no demolition fee will be paid, and the materials will be used to offset the wages.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>▲ Chen Jun Passes Through Yangzhou Heading North to Fill Defensive Positions. The Military Affairs Commission ordered Chen Tiaoyuan to lead his troops to various counties in Jiangbei to fill the defensive positions previously held by Liang's army. On the 8th, he arrived in Zhenjiang from Nanjing, boarded four small steamers, and towed three or four civilian boats. He passed through Yangzhou northward in the afternoon to prepare for taking over the defensive positions. The unit consisted of about a regiment. The Zhenjiang-Yangzhou evening shift was canceled as a result.</p>
<p>▲ Arrest of the Main Culprit in the Unauthorized Construction of a Private Dam. Zhang Fengshan, the Deputy Head of the Kuanglaiji Township in Yang County, previously accused Zhang Qingguo of unauthorized construction of a private dam, which hindered public water conservancy. The County Magistrate and the Second District Office, together with the local Public Security Bureau, ordered him to remove it but he failed to comply. He was summoned for questioning but avoided it. Yesterday, the Second Branch Bureau arrested Zhang and sent him to the County Government for handling.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>▲ Kidnapper Who Fled to Shanghai Apprehended. Cao Longsi, a kidnapper from Dongxiang in Nantong, fled to Shanghai due to strict pursuit. He was apprehended by the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. After interrogation, it was confirmed that the crime occurred in Nantong. The case was transferred to Nantong County Government, which was notified to send police to escort him back.</p>
<p>▲ Question of Choosing a Superintendent for the Relief Center. The Department of Civil Affairs found that Zhao Jianhua, the Director of the Nantong County Relief Center, had engaged in misconduct in Zhenjiang and ordered the County Government to immediately remove him from office and appoint a suitable replacement. County Magistrate Zhang then selected Xu Gengqi and Zong Weichuan as Director and Deputy Director respectively. However, both Xu and Zong firmly declined the positions, so a candidate has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>▲ Chief of Water Police Accused of False Charges and Extortion. Gao Zhongkui, the former commander of the 25th Detachment of the 6th District of Water Police, stationed in Xinghua, and also the head of the Gaoyou, Jiangdu, Xinghua and Taixian four county Luyanghu Bandit Suppression, arbitrarily arrested farmers Wu Zhihe and Bai Guishan in Shuangwang Village, Yizong, Liuli, Gaoyou County, this spring. They were falsely accused of being connected to bandits and colluded with local ruffian Wu Bangnian to testify, with the intention of extorting a large sum of money. The victims' families reported to the County Government and telegraphed the Civil Affairs Department to appeal for justice. County Magistrate Li sent police to Xinghua to escort Wu and Bai back, but was unsuccessful. Gao Zhongkui's subordinates sent the witnesses in the case to the Yangzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office for interrogation. After repeated investigations and inquiries by Director Zhang, it was determined that the case was indeed a conspiracy to frame the victims for extortion. He immediately telegraphed Cheng, the District Chief of the 6th District of Water Police stationed in Guazhou, to quickly send Gao Zhongkui and Li Zhenhong, the detective chief of the detachment, to Yangzhou for questioning. Gao and Li confessed that they had arrested people and extorted money. They were immediately arrested and detained. Wu and Bai were released on bail. Later, because the Commissioner's Office was ordered to be abolished, Wu Bangnian was sent back to Gaoyou for disposition. Gao Zhongkui and Li Zhenhong were sent to the 6th District Office for custody. County Magistrate Li ordered all the witnesses in the case to be summoned. The court was held yesterday by Judge Zhang. Wu Bangnian was found to be clearly suspected of conspiracy to extort and was ordered to be returned to custody. It is now heard that County Magistrate Li has reported the interrogation in this case to the Civil Affairs Department and ordered the 6th District Office to send the two criminals, Gao and Li, back to Gaoyou for trial.</p>
