<h3 id="c1">一年來之上海金融動態 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>仁</p>
<p>世界銀價自一九二九年而後急轉直下至於昨年五六月之際已發見空前之新低價我國爲用銀國家其直接所誘發之影響爲商品價格之上騰其間接所釀成者爲外商企業利潤之再投資而我國連年内戰頻仍内地遊資爲求安全計都漸次集中於上海一埠同時數年以來國家財政支絀賴舉公債以彌補昨年一年先後凡七次總額達四萬萬六千八百萬元是項公債之應募者都爲銀行其結果遂造成銀行紙幣之增發</p>
<p>故昨年一月以降在上海金融市塲上曾有一度通貨澎漲現象之出現而此通貨澎漲之結果形成物價之昂騰及資本之澎漲據國定稅則委員會之報吿一月份之上海物價總指數爲一一九　七九月份爲一二九　二上騰幾及百分之十至資本澎漲之程度則可於後述四項之現象中窺之其一爲地價之昂騰自一九二六年至一九三Ｏ年之五年間上海住宅地價格計上騰二十萬萬兩而就中半數之十萬萬兩爲一九三Ｏ年中所增高者至昨年昂騰之程度如何吾人雖不能具體作答然以前昨兩年之上海土地買賣額而觀則昨年爲一萬萬三千萬前年爲六千五百萬其增高額幾及一倍其二爲證劵之上漲昨年公債價格平均漲百分之七此外外商公司之股票價格大約漲百分之十左右其三爲工業之發展據中行報吿十九種國貨工業中除一二種稍遜者外平均每種工業之營業約增加百分之五十左右其四爲銀行之發達昨年一年中上海新設之銀行計有十一家之多而全年上海二十七會員銀行之純益爲二千九十九萬六千八百四十七元與已繳之　萬萬四千五百七十八萬四千七百八十五元資本額相對比時平均純益爲百分之十五左右</p>
<p>此通貨澎漲現象至昨年九月以後以銀價之恢復公債之過多災害之頻臨及九一八事變之突發遂引起一通貨萎縮之反響於是物價下落地價暴跌公債價格狂降紙幣减少銀行存欵減退現金死藏資本减縮而曩日蓬渤之假景氣遂繫破無遺矣</p>
<p>今年一二八滬戰爆發排貨之空氣益熾而直接因戰事之公私損失尤鉅加之滿洲僞國成立各種稅收被攫於是上海金融市况益形恐慌而通貨萎縮之現象益顯據中國銀行之調查本年六月分上海各銀行之紙幣發行額爲一萬萬八千二百三十八萬一百三十四元較之昨年八月分之二萬萬八千一百九十七萬五千五百二十七萬相差爲九千九百五十九萬五千三百九十三元幾减少二分之一左右至資本减縮之程度如何尙無確實之統計可稽然去年水災損失五萬萬元滬戰損失十五萬萬元封貨損失一萬萬元要皆在今日通貨萎縮現象下所可注意者也</p>
<p>在經濟學之理論上過度之通貨澎漲與過度之萎縮皆足以引起社會之不健全蓋通貨澎漲之極度可以促成水沬景氣而結果造成恐慌時代之襲來反之在通貨萎縮之極度必致引起物價激落產業不振失業迭出之非常狀態故今日我國有識之士都主張節約消費排除不生產之［信用］以救濟目前及今後通貨萎縮之弊害然而今日我國經濟之不平衡其原因千頭萬緒至爲複雜固不僅浪費與不生產信用之澎漲而已</p>

<h3 id="c83">財宋重要談話 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>關於日本攫取東省海關事件</p>
<p>國民新聞社云、財政部長宋子文昨日發表關於日本攫取東省海關事件之談話如下、</p>
<p>［東三省各海關、自於本年三月間、爲日本强制接收以來、迄今未有分文匯解中央、以爲償付債欵之用、且不僅此也、即各銀行之存欵、在日本未攫取各關之前存在總稅務司名下者、至今尙有三分之二、在日本或僞滿洲國掌握之中、而中國政府尙竭力繼續支付各項借欵賠欵等、每月約滬銀一千三百萬兩之鉅、日本旣完全蔑視持有債劵者之利益、故其國際信用、遂有墮落之象、今試將中日兩國政府所發行同時滿期之債欵二種之價格、一加比較、即可見其大槪矣、其比較約如下、</p>
<p>中國五厘善後債欵、期限一九一三年至一九六Ｏ年、在本年四月一日、約在日本開始干涉東省海關之際、價格爲六十二、惟在本年九月一日、已增至六十八、</p>
<p>日本六厘金借欵、期限一九二四年至一九五九年、在本年四月一日之價格、爲七十九、而在本年九月一日之價格、已降至六十八又二分之一、</p>
<p>中國債劵、依據九月一日之價格計算、其利息爲七厘八、而日本債劵之利息、約爲九厘二、由此觀之、中國五厘債劵之價値、今實與日本六厘債劵之價値相等也、</p>
<p>再則日本新聞聯合社、近發表所謂關東租借地政府編製之統計報吿、内稱、本年上半年、大連海關稅收、大見增加一節、宋氏對此、亦有以下之談話云、</p>
<p>［該關之稅收、若以銀位論、則已低減、據總稅務司報吿、本年自一月一日至六月二十五日、即在日本未攫取大連海關以前、其稅收之總額、爲關平銀六百六十二萬八千三百四十八兩七錢一分、若以滿六個月計算之、其總收入當在關平銀六百八十一萬二千兩之譜、此數較之去歲上半年之稅收、實减收二十五萬三千兩之譜、因去歲上半年、大連稅收總額、爲關平銀七百零六萬五千七百十三兩零四分也、而日本報吿中、乃用日金計算、表示稅收之增進、實則該關之稅收、毫無增加、而徒令人駭悉日金價格之大落、一年之前、日金每元値美金四十九分、今日已降至美金二十二分半矣、此皆日本軍閥、在中國東北及上海之狂行所致、由此可見、日本外相内田、雖大言滿洲如何可望和平繁榮、實則日本强佔該地、徒令其幣値慘落、及國内經濟、益覺不堪］云云、</p>
<h3 id="c84">昨日北市市民又起恐慌 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>當局力謀息謠辦法</p>
<p>本市近來謠諑紛紜、人心驚惶、中日雙方、雖一再聲明、上海不致發生第二次戰事、而人民仍覺未安、加之昨日下午一時許、閘北一帶、忽有二架飛機、低飛過境、好事者又妄加猜度、遂益引起該處居民之恐惶、住居北四川路·老靶子路以北·狄司威路·及閘北等處居民、自昨日清晨起、即紛紛遷至租界中段、直至深夜、搬塲汽車、不絶於途、</p>
<p>▲吳市長之談話　據市長吳鐵城語中央社記者云、本市治安、安謐如常、謠諑紛紜、都屬臆度、本人忝長滬市、全市治安、負責維持、對於該項漫無稽考之謠諑、决用極嚴厲之手段、加以制止、藉以安定人心、且本人深悉本市决無二次戰事發生、日方亦無再造成上海二次戰爭之計劃、至於愛國運動、亦當納入正軌、否則愛國適足以誤國云云、</p>
<p>▲溫局長之談話　公安局長溫應星昨亦負責表示云、日來滬上之緊張空氣、均係市民輕信謠言自相驚擾所致、本人負地方治安之責、各方面如有圖擾治安之陰謀、當秘密偵查、報吿中央、以謀制止、至傳日方將再度擾滬、本人未獲報吿、不能證實、况共同委員會遇有事變、亦可出而制裁、故希望市民有以鎭靜處之云、</p>
<p>▲日再發聲明書　華聯社二日本埠消息、虹口一帶搬家者甚多、日方决家、乘吳市長聲明書宣佈後、將日本電信局内陸戰隊、定明晨實行撤去、今日下午、杉坂司令官、再發聲明書云、</p>
<h3 id="c85">日陸戰隊未向市府抗議 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>市府負責人聲明</p>
<p>日來盛傳日陸戰隊司令、向市府抗議各報登載其軍隊示威消息、並將以嚴厲手段對付各節、記者特於昨午、驅車赴市府叩詢眞相、承某負責人說明、此項消息、全係奸人造謠、並非事實、並稱各記者負指導社會之責、對於全屬子虚、足以擾亂市民心理之各種記載、亦應隨時設法糾正云、</p>

<p>昨日下午八时許、有日本陸戰隊兵士約七八十人、分乘二卡車、過外白渡橋、當駛至黃浦灘路南京路口時、交通燈正打紅燈、而該日兵卡車、因急欲通過、幾將管理電車岔道兩小童撞倒、値崗華捕見狀、以其違章、上前質問、日兵反遷怒兩童子、下車毆打、華捕立即攔阻、内有一童乘機逃逸、該兵士等即將在旁一童拘捕上車、希圖開駛、時在旁觀看者、中外人士甚多、見狀咸爲不平、中有一西人、曾上前交涉、遭日兵侮辱、於是西人方面、亦起憤慨、内有一西人、即將自備汽車開出、横梗路中、以阻日卡車行動、管理交通燈之印捕、以事將擴大、亦前來交涉、以致該處交通頓時阻斷、車輛擁塞不堪、華捕即亟用電話、向總巡捕房報吿、當即指派大批中西探捕到塲彈壓、設法將該兵士等圍住、令其上車、押至捕房、所有中外證人及被毆童子亦隨同到案、經詢問一過、即由捕房用電話通知該管長官、命其押回、各證人亦簽字外出、惟該被毆童子暫留捕房、以便詳詢一切、</p>
<h3 id="c87">日本承認僞國後東北航權全失 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>航運界將起變化</p>
<p>日本已定本月十五日、承認滿洲僞組織、從此以後、我國航行東北之商輪、將受重重束縛、而營口安東各港之航行權、恐屆時完全斷送日商之手矣、</p>
<p>▲東北將徵噸鈔　東北海關被以奪後、我國雖高唱封鎖政策、但遲迥郤顧、總未實現、而僞組織以成立以來、迄未得國際上之承認、故營口安東等處、海關雖强占、而始終未敢徵收進出口稅與船舶噸稅、蓋恐引起國際糾紛也、因之中外商輪、仍可照舊通行、未有阻碍、今日本贸然承認僞國、在東北範圍内安東營口各海關、其已經計擬而未敢實行之船鈔、將在九月十五日以後、即就日輪起開始徵收、凡不納噸稅之船、便實行禁止進口、</p>
<p>▲行輪先訂商約　查輪船往來、凡國與國之間、彼此通行、商船互相贸易、須先訂立通商條約、日本與僞組織、已先訂有密約、此固盡人而知、今承認其國、凡屬開往東北之商輪、不問英美各國船舶、在未立通商條約以前、即不得駛入安東營口等口岸、刻下世界各國、均未承認僞國、更談不到通商立約、則東北海口、即外輪亦不能駛往、本埠太古怡和等、對此事亦在討論及探聽中矣、</p>
<p>▲華船發生問題　華商輪航行東北者、有招商·肇興·政記·毓大·海昌·等局、上年九一八以後、肇興·毓大·海昌·政記·各輪、均任用日本船員、添備僞國旗號、燃用東北劣煤、得以准許行駛、招商局圖南輪上月擬開赴營口、因船主爲國人、曾經去電探問、得到復電、阻止前往、免生意外、圖南遂未敢開去、今後日本承認僞國、恐肇興毓大等許行之華輪、亦將發生問題、因我國係否認僞組織最力者也、</p>
<p>▲日船獨占優勢　九月十五日以後、東北航權、將爲日本商輪獨占、蓋東北出產雜糧藥材荳油荳子等項、每年運赴歐美各國者、僅大荳一項、須數十萬噸、而我國汕頭厦門各埠去路亦不少、向來近海各路、由滬上中外各輪派船往裝、今則中國船旣不能前往、外商輪亦以未曾承認問題而坐棄大好航業、則每年數十萬噸之出口貨、完全爲日本船獨運、故在去年大連·大阪·日郵近海等、均添造大批商輪、一若預知有九一八事者、今則已各派航東北矣、東北航業被奪、單就我國航輪而言、每年損失運費、至少六七千萬元也、</p>

<p>郭致訓詞　略謂、本人奉國民政府命令、來任本廠廠長、深懼學騐不足、能力勿勝、以前雖歷任工程機械職務、對造幣情形、則少有研究、好在本廠同人中、很多兄弟之舊同學、必能予以良好之協助、本廠開鑄不遠、本人對於鑄造新幣方面、有希望兩點、（一）新幣成色、務求準確、（二）鑄造方法、力求經濟、所幸本廠一切造幣機器、非特爲全中國各地造幣廠冠、抑且足以媲美歐西、將來出品迅速、成色完足、可以預期、同時兄弟對於本廠同人、亦有希望二點、一·遵守辦事程序、考程序二字之定義、在軍隊曰紀律、在學校曰校規、在工廠則曰廠規、各同人各工友、如均能切實聽從上級人員之指揮、則必可達到有條不紊秩序井然之目的、二·要具合作精神、本廠如僅有正副廠長科長等少數人員、决不能成功一個工廠、必須各同人各工友、犧牲個人私意、開誠相見、互相聯絡、分工合作、始克有濟、而最緊要者、即須明瞭本廠爲帶有營業性質之工廠、各同人應認清此點、切不可稍有官塲習氣、對於一切政治活動、尤須抛諸腦後、務必專心致力廠務、以求新幣產量之增多、成色之精良、本人有厚望焉、</p>
<p>聞郭廠長俟該廠正式開鑄時、再補行宣誓典禮云、</p>

<p>荷蘭庚欵之退還問題、經外部與荷使磋商後、已將協定擬就、經雙方請訓復到、即可正式簽字、惟荷方對中荷公私借欵、要求須有一種辦法、至上次所傳之荷庚欵數目、據海關方面人員稱、略有錯誤、茲分誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>▲不久簽字　昨據滬外交界人談、荷庚欵協定、現雙方在請示中、我方大致無甚問題、僅待荷政府之訓令到、雙方正式簽字、即可生效、然該協定是否荷方退還、抑係放棄、現尙不得而知、蓋中荷庚欵問題、當荷使歐登科氏在任時、曾於民國十四年十月間、奉該國政府訓令、照會我國外部、表示善意、願將庚子賠欵荷蘭一部份之餘額放棄、而以全數欵項、用於中國治理黃河水道之用、荷蘭可派一二工程師、幷附設一監察委員會、辦理此事、嗣經我國外交財政内政三部集議後、適因我國國内多事、以致完全停頓、現在該協定是否由外部與荷使另擬退還辦法、抑仍係根據前議所商定、將餘額放棄、當局尙未明白宣示、如係放棄、則現下餘額已無多、殊不如民十四年之餘額數目上算矣、</p>

<p>▲借欵數目　該協定之成立、聞荷方表示、須對中荷公私借欵有辦法、據新聲社記者由海關方面調查結果、知中荷借欵僅兩項、一爲民國七年二月間荷蘭銀行之轉賬期票兩紙、共計銀四二七、一三九·七六兩、至民國十四年十二月三十一日、本利增至七三九、七六八·二九兩、嗣經虞和德一再與政府接洽後、始改爲借欵、此爲私方者、再關於官方者、係民國九年十二月、荷政府照料我國遣送回國之德奥等國僑民、於經過荷境所代墊之欵項、共計一七、七二五·八九盾、利息八九仙、該欵本應由德奥等國擔付、但因當時係戰事時期、我國無從向德奥等國接洽、故暫由我國擔付云、</p>

<p>贓物股主任利令智昏</p>
<p>韓退之秘書涉有嫌疑</p>
<p>萬兩烟土已潛自運出</p>
<p>溫局長希望澈底查究</p>
<p>自市公安局第三科贓物股主任　章紹毅、盜換烟土鉅案發覺後、社會人士、僉認爲自上海警務成立以來、空前未有之奇聞、大多主張澈查根究、務使本案眞相大白、免貽警界前途之羞、記者昨特親訪溫局長及從各方刺探所得、覺案情異常複雜、主從人犯牽涉甚多、茲將詳情、分述於後、</p>
<p>▲贓物庫防範嚴密　近數月來、市公安局所轄水巡隊及各區分所共破大批土案、前後約計三四萬兩、曾經各該區隊於破獲時、悉用火漆固封、另加封條印記、完全申解第三科、交贓物股保存、俟日後轉解市政府監視銷燬、故該股責任異常重大、而防範警備亦較嚴、平日除該股主任或科長等上級人員、得以進出檢閱證物外、其餘在局人員、一槪不得擅入、此外如無贓物取存、庫門均加封下鍵、以資愼重、故每屆局長更替時、贓物股主任一席、非局長之親信或具　有戚族關係者、絶不能輕易蟬聯、</p>
<p>▲笨重麻袋大可疑　市公安局自溫應星局長蒞任後贓物股主任即易章紹毅繼之、而章年少老成、向爲溫局長所器重、詎料天下事竟有出人意料之外者、上月二十八日十一時許局中警察大隊正在局内四週梭巡之際、内有巡邏警林某、忽然瞥見贓物股僕役季阿四·吳得裕·及偵緝隊僕役小麻子等三人、在贓物庫附近搬運甚多之笨重麻袋、而形色倉倉皇皇、鬼鬼祟崇、同時又見該處停有黃包車二輛、形似專候運用該項麻袋者、</p>
<p>▲將僞土掉換眞土　該警等異之、趨前細察、見有最大麻袋兩個、袋内完全眞正烟土、約近萬元、更有較小之袋七只、袋上蓋有水巡隊印記、而細察袋内、乃均係僞土（俗稱料子、）警等遂向其盤詰、據季阿四稱、頃奉章主任之命、特來將僞土掉換眞土、警等更詰其僞土從何而來、據答係由本局某某隊自備汽車陸續潛運局中、以作掉換眞土之用等語、</p>
<p>▲章紹毅奉命扣押　該警等聞語、更覺駭異、遂立報大隊長將季等三僕扣留、專候明晨報吿局長、詎至翌晨、章紹毅主任到局聞訊後、立將三僕一併保釋、而同時大隊長及三科科長吳芷泉、亦據情報吿局長、當時溫局長即將章細詰一過、正在澈查、其時市長吳鐵城業經聞悉、以公安局旣發生如是鉅案、異常震怒、當即飭令溫局長、先行將章扣押、訊明詳復、</p>
<p>▲案中牽涉韓秘書　溫局長奉令後、遂將章交大隊部扣押、一面交由第三科研訊、業經兩度詳審、因案關秘密、未允發表、但據司法科傳出確息、謂第一次預審時、章之供内牽及本局人員甚多、待二次審訊時、供詞即加以修正、而此時章僅稱本案主使爲主任秘書韓進　（字退之）一人、並稱事前曾由韓數度向渠密商掉換烟土事、渠均未允、最後更謂當時雖有人將七袋僞土送到局中時、渠尙疑係正式贓物、</p>
<p>▲溫局長發表談話　昨日午後、記者特往訪溫局長、據稱、韓秘書前歷任京漢·京奉·京綏·津浦·各鐵路重要任務、與余（溫自稱）相交有素、向無越軌行動、且人格亦頗高尙、渠於上月二十八日、即請假三日、返杭州原籍掃墓、已於昨日期滿、尙未銷假、今日忽接其來電一通、請求續假、關於此事、今晨已報吿吳市長、市長命令將韓通緝、現已電請杭州市公安局協助設法將其弋獲、歸案嚴究、依法應送法院辦理、在韓未弋獲、靜候市府命令辦理、本日車站輪埠等處、已派探員嚴偵彼之踪跡矣、末謂余深知此案内容、異常複雜、個中定有特殊情形存在、况韓秘書年近耳順、上海市情、並不十分熟諳、即以購辦僞土論、若非老於此道者、絶無從購得、即此一端、絶非韓與章兩人所能辦到、余甚希望本案澈底究明、俾余一片坦白、得能昭示社會、而獲長官諒解也、</p>

<p>斜徐路滬南公共汽車公司宣吿停業後、公司欠薪、早經黨政决定發給、但公司當局爲限令工人繳還制服銅牌及離廠等問題、引起爭執、故欠薪至今仍未發給、工人認爲資方無誠意、除分向各界請求援助外、並定今日上午、全體工人、向黨政當局請願、茲將各情分紀於後、</p>
<p>▲欠薪未發　公司欠薪問題、早經黨政機關决定勞資雙方派員核對工賬後、卽行發給、惟其他要求、則另案調處、但資方堅欲工人將制服銅牌及離廠等各節承認後、方可發給欠薪、而工人方面、對離廠問題、可以接受、至於繳還制服銅牌、爲生活保障攸關、一致拒絶、公司欠薪、至今仍未發給、現雙方爭持甚烈、工潮有擴大之可慮、</p>
<p>▲工人大會　全體工人、以公司負責之董事及經理、均避不見面、而祗有清理人江萬平會計師出面料理、深覺欠薪尙多週折、則所提要求、更難有實現可能、故不得不籌劃對付方法、爰於昨日下午二時、召集全體大會、决定（一）反對公司限令繳還制服銅牌、（二）全體工人請願黨政機關、要求嚴令公司恢復營業、（三）停業期内工資、應由公司一律照發、（四）倘公司當局故意延長日期、不願工友生活、則以全力誓死應付、（五）泣告各界秉公援助、</p>
<p>▲黨政疏通　自公司於八月三十日宣告停業、市黨部·社會局·據勞資雙方呈報後、卽派樊國人·彭振球·分向雙方調查、並設法調處、但工方爲要求先發欠薪、而資方則限令工人繳還銅牌制服及離廠、雖經該員等連日奔走疏通、並擬定處理辦法、煞費苦心、但勞資雙方各走極端、情勢突變、較前尤感棘手、茲據市黨部代表樊國人語記者云、業已擬具解决辦法、按次進行、務必使此項工潮、早日解决、</p>
<p>▲今日請願　全體工人、以公司停業後、欠薪未發、生計已呈恐慌、且公司又無切實誠意解决之表示、特經大會决定於今日上午全體整隊向黨政機關請願、要求嚴令公司復業、</p>

<p>網球大將邱飛海氏、自香港來滬、已於昨日下午二時抵此、搭法郵阿多斯二號、昨日往碼頭歡迎者、本報記者外、有林寶華、沈昆南等、下船後乃與林君合攝一影、邱君雖長途跋途、精神甚佳、後趨車往鄧祿普公司梅爾斯君住宅、將下榻是處、邱君此來、據談乃特來參加滬上各項比賽、因如國際羅泊松公開雙打、但爲與林君二人所保持者、仍將努力保持已得光榮、明年則將退息休養、與新進諸人如鄭兆佳等以機會云、</p>

<p>記者以前日本報所刊送鄭兆佳赴美洲意見、詢林君寳華、林君之談話頗具遠見、爲述之如次、</p>
<p>▲鄭兆佳赴美時機未熟　鄭君兆佳宜送之赴美、余（林自謂）二年前、卽有此建議、盡人皆知、惟此時舊事重提、未必有所收效、而於鄭君球藝之進步、反恐生阻礙、宜待鄭君在滬得一二錦禁後、社會之信仰較佳、收效必更可、至於鄭君宜仍努力於自已球藝之增進、</p>
<p>▲妄加攻擊殊令人悔心　至於近來攻擊余個人者、實不値一笑、余自信對於祖國之效力、殊無愧對、中國網球興趣之日增、未始非邱君與余獲八屆遠東錦標所鼓起、余曾在美洲獲三州錦標、在滬奪得各項中西錦標、於祖國之光榮、皆已竭盡微力、而有以台維斯杯爲口實者、則須知吾等劈頭所遇、卽爲美國、試問誰能擊敗鐵爾豋、評者不加鼓勵、反而甚至謂余與邱君、皆已告完結、誠不能不令人悔心慨嘆、今歲與邱君仍合作奮鬥後、明季則讓新進者以機會云、</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語録</p>
<h3 id="c161">對内不許枉費一槍彈 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>日前廢止内戰大同盟大會推定馬相伯等十五人爲名譽委員·據我回想相老人前次答覆發起此同盟函件，當然是始終贊助此義舉：因爲相老人早已默契！可惜因康健關係，未能參與此會。</p>
<p>當相老人接得廢止内戰大同盟的發起通啓，就吿訴我寫封回信，大意說道：</p>
<p>［我去年不是發表過一篇警吿國人書麽？已經表示過，今後希望眞正民意，澈底充分表現：如非國民公意許可，對内絶對不許枉費一槍彈；對外必要不許吝惜一槍彈！現在旣有人提出實行的方略，快覆發起人信，說我欣然贊成！］</p>
<p>因此，我又想起兩件事。</p>
<p>一是相老人述及日本仿製美國手槍的奇速。他吿訴那來訪的日本記者說過，美國軍艦於明治開國前後，有一次航到日本，船上的美國人，送到岸上的日本人手裏兩樣禮物，］柄手槍和一把傘：那料到第二天，日本人將仿製成功的手槍和傘，一禮還一禮，送還美國人。相老人並不以日本人善於仿製爲奇；他倒很奇異我們至今還不能完全利用國產，由國人自製一現代新式的槍砲。</p>
<p>一是相老人述及日本仿製美國手槍的奇速。他他吿訴那來訪的日本記者說過，美國軍艦於明治開國前後，有一次航到日本，船上的美國人，送到岸上的日本人手裏兩樣禮物，］柄手槍和一把傘：那料到第二天，日本人將仿製成功的手槍和傘，一禮還一禮，送還美國人。相老人並不以日本人善於仿製爲奇；他倒很奇異我們至今還不能完全利用國產，由國人自製一現代新式的槍砲。</p>
<p>一是相老人閱報，常見火藥庫失愼的消息，不禁長嘆；［領薪俸的有人；負責任的無人：所以中國要亂到這地步！即如對於火藥一事，旣無有科學的知識的來保管，讓那些不負責的燬盡了！］</p>
<h3 id="c162">自家事 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 許厪文</p>
<p>上海人可哀</p>
<p>東坡說：［一老人，對於生死之際，看得透澈，臨終訓諸子曰［只宜第一五更起］又言［唯五更又勾當自家事，自家事者，即是死時將得去者也。按之儒訓，此［自家事］即修身立命的大道，所以重在五更者，即孟氏所謂［平旦之氣也。］凡人惑於名利，耽於淫逸，心之所思，身之所行，什九以上皆損人利已之事，獨至午夜夢回晨鐘侵曉，當陰盡陽生之際，惡念寂而善心忽生，具大知慧者，常能力持此一點靈機，守而勿失，擴而充之，一心瑩澈，俗慮漸蠲，［天君安泰，］生死兩忘雖至最後五分時，未嘗感得絲毫慚恨，即到了死後，亦可以清凈無業之力，往生極樂，這便所謂［死時將得去者］眞自家事也。</p>
<p>我爲什麽寫出這一叚迂話來哩。因爲寄居上海這等地方，幾個朋友，隨便頑幾圈談幾句，或跑來跑去，東吃吃西頑頑，糊糊塗塗地一攪，不知不覺，就弄到兩三點鐘。而且重要的辦事時間，和朋友的約會，大多數總在午後三四點之後。假如八九點鐘起身，出門訪友，多半是要擾人清夢的。什麽五更？什麽平旦？情勢和事實，只纔合上眼皮子，一日十二時，最難得的一時間，都從睡夢中過去，所謂［自家事，］簡直無從着想，更不必高談實行了。然而偏是上海人頂忙，忙得一生，一逕不曾替自家辦得</p>
<p>些些事，因此我覺得上海人、（其實不僅上海）、可哀！尤其覺得上海的社會可怕！</p>
<p>然而我本人，也是上海人之一……</p>

<p>如果說：大家是有職業的，那就不該去了正事不幹，來到這塲合嚼白蛆。因爲，不做正經事情而偷着貪圖安逸，是最要不得的。</p>
<p>况且，這一夥里，佔居多數的，仍是那些被社會排擠出來的失業人們。</p>

<p>離合易　手績簡</p>
<p>在去年聖誕節的後二天，我們的廂樓裏搬來了一家新鄰居，。男主人約有五十餘歲了，瘦得像一根樹桿兒。女主人約二十歲左右，完全是一位少女的模型。據說他們倆的關係，不是父女也不是翁媳，倒是不折不扣的夫妻。</p>
<p>過了沒有多少時候，淞滬戰事爆發了。我們所住的房屋，適同鐵絲網做了很密切的鄰居，於是乎大家都忙着逃難，我們的廂房樓嫂嫂，當然也不能例外。待到今年三月裏，大家逃難也逃得乏味了，於是乎陸續的搬回來，廂房樓嫂嫂，當然也不能例外，做了一個認巢的舊燕。</p>
<p>但是新奇的事兒發現了。我們的廂房樓嫂嫂逃難時，是同了瘦得像樹桿兒的丈夫逃的，回來時，却同了一個三十左右的矮胖子回來的。據說，伊的丈夫往漢口去了，這位矮胖子，是伊的丈夫［招盤］得來的。</p>
<p>到七月上旬的某一個晚上，廂房樓裏突然的夫婦衝突起來了。據矮胖子說，是爲了伊不守婦道；據廂房樓嫂嫂說，是爲了他不顧赡養。哭，呌，打架，鬧了一夜。第二天，二人一同出去了。從此一星期，廂房樓嫂嫂。沒有回來過。二房東太太去探問廂房樓裏的娘姨（女傭）娘姨只說不知道。</p>
<p>第八天下午，門口汽車嗚嗚的響着，廂房樓嫂嫂回來了。奇怪得很，伊背後却跟着一位穿着很漂亮的西裝少年。明天，我們的二房東太太，偷偷地問廂房樓娘姨道，［昨天你們奶奶領來的少年是誰］？娘姨笑着道：［他是我們的少爺，我們奶奶的丈夫。］</p>

<p>爲黎明暉和鄭國有而發</p>
<p>香港一位朋友到上海來，閑譚到了黎明暉和鄭國有吃官司的事，他說：馮德謙的死，鄭國有主使是大約不會錯的。好得英國的法律重證據，凶手是鄭的車夫，此刻仍舊沒有捉到，那末，或者鄭國有的罪名會得不成立，也未可知。鄭是一個財主，他有好幾百萬家私，全是他的父親傳給他的，他曾經帶了八萬塊錢到上海來，因爲迷戀着黎妹妹，能在幾個月的工夫都化盡了，回去的時候，盤費還是借工纔能動身。這回歌舞團到南洋，他同黎妹妹是舊相識，自然格外親熱，但是，黎妹妹爲什麽不受人抬舉，她不願跟鄭國有偕老，反而去同一個一無恒產的馮德謙去要好？我問那位朋友，是不是鄭的相貌不及馮呢？他說也不盡然。因爲鄭國有也是一位濁世翩翩的佳公子，外表未必不及馮德謙，如此說來，眞是佛說的因緣前定了。</p>
<p>我聽了朋友的一席話，不免迂氣發作，我想：假使鄭國有沒有那許多遺產，倒不至於會發生這種苦惱，像他二十二歲的年紀，正在發奮向學的時代，他如其是一個平民，倒或者將來可以成功有爲的表年。此刻有了那麽多的遺產，吃着勿愁，正應了飽暖思淫慾的一句古諺，這還不是遺產給他的害嗎？現社會像鄭國有的人眞多，不過，不發生那種驚人的舉動，所以，也無從去調查，但我所曉得的已經很多了。</p>
<p>我所說的這一節事實忒含混，不過爲了有遺產，使這一個有爲的青年，爲了戀愛陷入法網，聽說明星的新片［國魂的復活，］開頭就描寫遺產的流毒，凡是已做父母的同未做父母的，都應得去看上一看才是。</p>

<p>（二）</p>
<p>全鎭的人，都恨袁瘋子，但是在戰事時期内，全鎭都逃空，而只留一個瘋子在鎭上的時候的情形，只有袁瘋子可以講述。所以在戰事平定了以後，大家都去問袁瘋子，想得到一些戰區内的實况；尤其是那位土豪劣紳式的市政委員諸伯方先生，因爲他的職責上，一定要把那時的情形，做一個呈文，報告當地的政府。</p>
<p>袁瘋子所述的大槪情形是這樣的—他講述得沒有系統，但是很生動，使全鎭的居民，都很激昂慷慨。</p>
<p>［在鎭外的小石橋，已被我軍拆斷，駕了一條臨時木板橋，沿河浜都掘了壕溝，這個戰壕直通到前面的趙家竹園。竹園裏藏着一尊小鋼砲，幾個砲手，日夜的躱在那裏，　伏着不動。那時　聽見砲聲隆隆，和頭頂飛機軋軋的聲音，尤其是機關槍，連續不斷地施放，震得耳朶也聾了。</p>
<p>我當時不會逃出鎭，後來竟不能給我一個機會再走；但是我後來决心不逃，想看看打仗究竟是一個什麽樣子。起初鎭上的軍隊，誰也沒有知道我還躱在我的屋子裏，直到那一天，我自已也不知道怎麽會跑到壕溝裏去了，他們才十分驚駭與奇怪。也許是我的瘋態，證明了我不是敵的奸細，否則早已被軍隊所槍斃的了。他們都按住了我，不許我動，不許我喊，不許我仰頭出去望前面。在那個時候，前面有零落的槍聲，接上便有嘘嘘的聲音，從我頭上掠過。</p>
<p>［全鎭上像死寂了一般，一些人犬的聲音都聽不見，但是槍砲聲是很例外。有一次，我也有些驚惶了。我在家裏煮飯的時候，忽然聽見一個鉅聲，像天翻地覆的樣子，我住着的屋子也震得要像坍下，桌子上的碗盞，都震到地下，我忙跑到屋外去逃避啊！天呀！余二姊住的那宅屋子，已完全倒翻，天殺的敵人飛機，一共有三隻，還在天上廻旋。</p>
<p>［有一位兵士，告訴我說：全鎭的軍隊，只有五十二個弟兄。有一次，前線潰了下來，這小鎭是十分吃緊，但是我們的袁團長嚴令我們不許後退。我們的連長連連去告急，請求把砲向後移動，但是袁團長也不許，只加派了一枝機關槍，到竹園裏去佈置。</p>

<p>昨粉市上下午各月份　大致呈平疲之象、以洋麥報價、又小一二三角左右、業外人心、觀望居多、一部份之經紀人、多數赴錫致交易頓寂、惟洋麥連小不已時局又謠言甚盛、此後如北路銷場、果受打擊、前途之蕭瑟、或者較一二八之情形、將更重大也、結果本月份較前日跌五厘、十月份跌七厘半、十一十二月份跌五厘、一月份跌七厘半、二月份跌五厘云、</p>

<p>昨期麥市面、上下午各月份市面　呈平靜之態、以洋麥雖又報小一二三角、惟實際問訊者實無其人、而國内之麥價、則以交通及時局、均無過落之可能、所以交易異常寂寞、下午更甚　九十二一二月份均空拍、市氣之無聊、可以想見、惟賣氣不暢、略趨昂勢、如十月份較好二分、十一月份好一分、餘未動、現麥因到銷兩寂、又無做開云</p>

<h3 id="c183">賣古董 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>販賣古董，原是一椿很好的生意經，就上海一部分言，古董掮客，每日靠此營生，衣食住行，人生四大要素，得以解决者的確不少。</p>
<p>我國古董，天然以故宮爲最夥，故古董掮客，往往埀涎六尺，百計想法者，天然大有其人，不料前日故宮古物，被人控吿盜賣，又昨據持載，北大敎授請中央勿遷故宮古物，上海大學敎授，詢問出賣古物眞相，此事雖經易院長培基聲明，曾賣去皮貨藥品三十一萬元，我相該院長無論如何說法，總覺得有些不負責任。</p>
<p>［蚊虫不釘無黃鴨蛋，］原是一句有經騐的土語，盜賣故宮古物的風聲，早已人言嘖嘖，現在易院長被人控吿，果然承認了，賣去皮貨藥品三十一萬元，我相故宮博物院院長，祗有保存之權，並無販賣之權，即稍明事理者，亦當明其責任。</p>
<p>［瓜田不納履，李下不整冠，］故宮古物，並非私有物品，該院長身處嫌疑之地，不得已而欲賣去古物，也應該先事呈明國府，經國府會議通過後，方可出售，現在並未聞有此項手續，直至人民發覺控吿，方始承認賣去皮貨藥品，此可疑者一也。</p>
<p>柴米油鹽，乃有市價，而古董則並無市價可言，即欲出售古董，爲表明心跡起見，亦應該公開標賣，始得免人非議，現在雖易院長承認賣去皮貨藥品三十一萬元，但是是否眞實，殊難憑信，此可疑者二。</p>
<p>故宮古物，原是甚多，皮貨藥品，僅其二類，現在皮貨藥品，不聲不響，潛然售去，則其他物品，是否能完全保存，亦是疑問，故宮古物，因爲覬觎的人很多·故一次二次被人盜賣偷竊，所以有保管委員會之組織，現在保管其名，而不保管其實，將如何說法呢。</p>
<p>本來，這種古物，我絶對不主張保存，因爲我國比較古物再重要的再寳貴的東西，尙不能保，區區古物，不過僅供一般大人先生的玩物，有何保管之足云，不過要賣，决不要如此賣法。</p>

<p>潦倒窮途日，英雄落魄悲，人情看冷暖，城下尙垂絲，何圖逢漂母，一飯恩早施，枯木逢春日，千金報母時，昻藏軀七尺，媿我寄人籬，幸得垂青睞，巾幗勝鬚眉，</p>

<p>河山裂帛苦烽烟，凄絶瀋陽碧血鮮，七日哭秦終有救，十年興越豈徒然，和戎盡是將軍策，報國應揚祖逖鞭，寄語熱河諸戰士，揮戈東指莫遲延，</p>

<p>— 江天覽</p>
<p>絲經雖爲吾國大宗出品，然因供不應求，價甚昻貴，今有人發明一種假絲，光亮色澤，與眞絲完全無二，非操是業者，幾莫能辨其眞僞，但質比絲稍鬆，僅可用以爲緯，不可用以爲經也，</p>
<p>濕絲製法　將棉花浸於硫酸硝酸中，乾後，復化於酒醇及以脫内用火力燒之，約汽水表四十度至五十度爲率，於是將棉花漿，舀入沙漏缸中，瀝清渣滓，乃用機器壓出膏水，置大管子内，　爲重壓，用力至四五十度，水已澈底澄清，隨灌入裝有Cook之小管子，考克孔小如針眼，故壓出之絲，與蠶吐無異，即將絲浸入水中，漂清酒醇氣味，即成有光有色之絲矣，</p>
<p>乾絲製法，與濕絲製法相同，蓋酒醇與以脫，其性甚燥，絲於水中撈起即乾，搖於筒管上，便不粘滯，但硫酸硝酸，必須漂盡，否則觸火即燃，爲害甚烈，其漂清酸水之法，祇須將絲放在亞德摩尼硫内立退，</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3 id="c186">也來談改良敎育 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 奕頤</p>
<p>八月十六日，本會有欣奚君的改良敎育一文發表，拜讀之下，不禁亦有所感，願爲一談：</p>
<p>是的，敎育與社會之關係是很密切，敎育事業發達，則社會事業日見繁榮，社會幸福日臻進步，不然，則國家怎能有發達强盛之理，是故而中國現在所以弄得如此之糟者，我認爲敎育的不發達，至少是一個最大的原因，</p>
<p>意大利的復興，賴乎敎育，土耳其的强盛，賴乎敎育，近而日本的稱雄一世，亦惟賴乎敎育之功而已，况且在歷史上吿訴我們，敎育的發達，與國家的强盛，確是有着深切的關係，如周如漢如宋……</p>
<p>但是·先哲們呐喊了十多年的提倡普及敎育，迄今却沒有看見過敎育的普及，不識字的人，還是佔着極大的多數，其中癥結究在何處？我認爲這就是敎育自身的腐敗，</p>
<p>社會敎育家庭敎育姑且不談，光談學校敎育吧！</p>
<p>從資本主義的制度侵襲到了中國以後，中國社會上的一切都是資本主義化了，學校是在社會上居於撫導地位的機關，然而亦何能免此？所以，非是中產階級以上人家的子弟，便不能向高貴（？）的學府之門有所問津，</p>
<p>記得五年前，一個師範生繳了五元或十元的保證金，就可安心吃飯讀書，如今則不然，飯錢至少須貼四元，講義體育圖書醫藥實騐等費各二元，每學期非二十元不辦，轉念到農村社會的日趨崩潰，惟有望洋興嘆而已也，</p>
<p>呵！　哉！曾有着無數的奇世英才，於此而埋歿，</p>
<p>我覺得現今的辦敎育者，免不了有一種私利之心（其實什麽事都如此），因爲這樣，所以本領差一些的敎師，也可以靠了大脚力而噉飯，學識不高明的學生，也可以把他按步就班的升級，證諸任何學校，任何學校都免不了這種事實，敎育前途，焉能設想？國家前途，安能樂觀？</p>
<p>我還覺得現今的一般辦敎育者，每不注意於［學以致用］四個大字［雖然形式方面，似乎是很整潔美化，但實質方面，亦宜有一種良好切實的訓導！每年總有整批的畢業生出來，但是結果，往往有許多是遭到失業的痛苦，這爲什麽呢？就是學非所用，用非所學，也就是畢業的學生，不能盡力於社會，更就是１１１１學校敎育的指針，並非指着社會的需要，</p>
<p>十年生聚十年敎訓，救國賴乎敎育，敎育不不良，國家不能强盛；這是我對於改良敎育的意見，高明者以爲如何？</p>
<p>環境</p>
<h3 id="c187">突變 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 薪傅</p>
<p>陽光斜射在玻璃窗上，精緻而整潔的書室，更顯得驕氣揚人了，好滿臉堆笑的把剛從郵差遞來的一封信摩弄着，猜想到以往他給好信的深情蜜意，臆料這正蘊藏着的内容，一定依然是很甜蜜，想到這裏，不由得豐圓的臉上，起了二個小渦。</p>
<p>好翼翼地將信拆開了，二顆飽含着熱情的眼珠，不瞬地貫注在白紙藍墨水字的一行一行間，從第一頁，第二頁，第三頁，她讀完了，但是她的神色也由着信紙的推移而變易了，本來泛現着紅色的皮膚，顯得白了，臉上二個笑渦，早已消滅了，眼睛先是睜得開開的，現在亦已合了下去，照此情形，明明是遭了打擊了</p>
<p>［莫非我看錯了吧？］她從呆去的神態中掙回來自語着，她終不信任第一次的看，重複伸展了信紙溫一下。</p>
<p>Ｍ妹　我自已也不相信念寫這麽一封信給你，我眞不該有這樣的信給你丨但我又不能不這樣寫給你，深知這信經過你的眼簾，會使你悲哀，痛苦丨或則竟有使我想像不到的難堪籠罩你丨Ｍ丨我罪孽了，但是……唉！我希望你能明瞭我的痛苦或更甚於你吧！</p>
<p>你不是曾經因我的家庭横暴而代我憂慮過嗎？記得當時我還在你跟前也說過，［雖則我的家庭横暴，但總不能把我們的愛情摧殘的，我憑我的奮勇而報答你的愛我。］唉！曾幾何時，竟使我的話慘吿失敗，你的憂慮成了效應，我終在横暴的家庭下屈服，我們的愛情終久給我的横暴家庭摧</p>
<p>殘了！</p>
<p>本來一個男子僅屈服於淫威下而放棄了心愛的，多少是人類的懦弱者，唉！我竟是個人類的懦弱者，（我只有這樣承認了，否則我將怎樣吿答你呢？）</p>
<p>［你如其不信認我和你作主的婚姻，那末，你去自由吧！就今始去吧，一切我都不管。］</p>
<p>這是我父親下的［覺書］我可憐正求學半途的青年，更可憐我僅依我父親支配而生存的孤零青年，明知這種覺書是絶無理由的，但我又何能替他抗爭呢？可是我的學業畢竟要成就，並且我還要爲社會服務而生存，我也想過假如因壓迫而自殺，倒不如屈服而留着爲社會做個服務者，我只有犧牲了我生命的幸福，更只有忍痛放棄了你的愛我。</p>
<p>Ｍ妹：我愛你，唉！於今我是不能愛你了，我是深負了你！過去的想像，未來的甜蜜，就此都完了。</p>
<p>傷心！我是不能再想！我更不能再寫了，在這最後，我還得懇求你，切不要爲這不幸事情重創了你的心，你是個天眞活潑的少女，你該明亮你的前途還多幸福，你就當了我是個薄倖人吧！</p>
<p>Ｍ：你或則就迷信了婚姻的因果罷！前生我們也許還沒曾種［因］，自然不能享得［果］的權利，唉！［情深緣未結］均作如是解罷丨祝健。Ｍ上</p>
<p>她第二次讀完了，她是不再說讀錯了，只覺得每一個字都有猙獰的魔鬼要抓她的心一般，出於意外的剌激，她畢竟嘗到了人生最難堪的痛苦，二顆淚珠捺不住的從將合的眼睛的長睫下溜了下來。</p>

<h3 id="c188">賣人丹的女子 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 天熊</p>
<p>當那華燈雪亮照耀如同白晝的當兒，熱鬧的四馬路一帶，各餐館中，便有一個二十餘歲的截髮時裝女子，手裏拿了一大匣的人丹，向各餐客兜售，瞧她的芳容，雖不能說如花似玉，倒也略具風姿、不過她的臉上、好似隱含着一種悲戚的樣子，</p>
<p>在下前天同了一位朋友，在ＸＸ菜館晚餐，她自然照例拿了人丹也向我們兜售，我因喝酒過多，那時倒也用得着人丹清清口，便向她買了一包，我因瞧她的舉止行動，不類一般浪漫式的輕狂女子，心想她怎樣會抛頭露面，出來賣人丹，再觀她面藏愁容，一定有說不出的苦衷蘊藏在她的内心，我很堅决的這樣揣想着，隨後便鼓起了我的好奇心，不期然而然的向她問起身世來，她也以爲是一個知音者，便把她的身世和我們開始作下列的談話，</p>
<p>唉丨像我這樣的人，眞命苦啊，我的丈夫，三年沒有生意，在鄕間又沒有人照應，今年三月間，同我來上海，他想托朋友謀一位置，可是朋友又找不到，直到如今，實在弄得無法可想，所以我才出來賣人丹的，她嗚咽地這樣說着，</p>
<p>那末你男人倒反在家裏嗎？我這樣問着，</p>
<p>是呀！我的丈夫，實在是一個沒用的人，起初是他出來賣的，賣了兩天，一包都沒有售掉，我眼看生活即將斷絶，死守在家裏，怎能過去，不得不自已出來想想法兒，他現在家看領小孩呢，她說，</p>
<p>那末你一天能賣多少錢哩？我的朋友問她，</p>
<p>咳！實在可憐，前幾天天熱，一天約賣一二塊錢，現在天氣風凉了，一塊錢都賣不到，先生你想！上海地方坐要坐錢，立要立錢，這一些些的微利，怎夠我們的開銷咧，她說，</p>
<p>那末將來天時漸漸地風凉了，人丹生意也漸漸地清淡了，你們夫妻三個人，在上海就拿最低的生活來講，非二三十元，不能維持你們的生活，那如何得了呢？我又這樣問她，</p>
<p>她這時又嗚咽起來，回答我道，現在我們弄得吃盡當光，一天不做，就一天不活，起初原想租房子居住，因爲沒有錢，祗得暫借一天半元大洋的小客棧寄宿，要是還到鄕間去罷，仍沒有法想，也是等死罷了，唉！</p>
<p>那末你鄕間可有什麽人？我又繼續問着，</p>
<p>婆婆早經去世，公公還是去年死的，姑娘小叔都沒有，我們從前是開洋貨店的，在湖州地方，很有聲名，後來家產蕩然，全是被我公公敗掉的，現在累得我們小輩受苦，不知前世作了甚麽孼，噫！她這樣回答我，</p>
<p>我聽了上面的話，便起了同情之心，接着就安慰她幾句，再想問下去，她因時間過久，就現着苦臉，和我們吿别了·（却酬）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Shanghai Financial Dynamics Over the Past Year <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Ren</p>
<p>Since 1929, global silver prices have plummeted. By May or June of last year, unprecedented lows were reached. As a country that uses silver, China was directly impacted by rising commodity prices. Indirectly, foreign businesses reinvested their profits. Meanwhile, due to frequent internal conflicts, mobile funds from the interior gradually concentrated in Shanghai for safety. At the same time, for several years, the national fiscal deficit has been covered by issuing public bonds. Last year alone, seven issues were made, totaling $468 million. Banks were the subscribers to these public bonds, resulting in increased issuance of paper money by banks.</p>
<p>Therefore, since January of last year, Shanghai's financial market experienced a period of inflation. This inflation led to soaring prices and capital expansion. According to a report by the National Tariff Commission, the general price index in Shanghai was 119 in January and 129 in September, an increase of nearly 10%. The extent of capital expansion can be seen in the following four phenomena: First, land prices soared. In the five years from 1926 to 1930, residential land prices in Shanghai increased by 200 million taels, with half of that, 100 million taels, added in 1930. While we cannot give a specific figure for last year's increase, judging from land sales in Shanghai in the past two years, last year's sales were $130 million, compared to $65 million the year before, nearly doubling. Second, securities prices rose. Last year, public bond prices rose by an average of 7%. In addition, foreign companies' stock prices rose by about 10%. Third, industrial development occurred. According to a Bank of China report, among 19 types of domestic industries, except for one or two that performed slightly worse, the average business volume of each industry increased by about 50%. Fourth, banks flourished. Last year, 11 new banks were established in Shanghai. The total net profit of the 27 member banks in Shanghai throughout the year was $20.996847 million. Compared to the paid-up capital of $145.784785 million, the average net profit was about 15%.</p>
<p>This inflationary phenomenon, after September of last year, due to the recovery of silver prices, the excessive amount of public bonds, frequent disasters, and the sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident, triggered a deflationary reaction. As a result, prices fell, land prices plummeted, public bond prices collapsed, paper money decreased, bank deposits declined, cash was hoarded, and capital shrank. The false prosperity of the past vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>This year, the January 28th Shanghai Incident broke out, further intensifying the boycott of Japanese goods, and the public and private losses directly caused by the war were enormous. In addition, with the establishment of the Manchurian puppet state, various tax revenues were seized. As a result, Shanghai's financial situation became even more panicked, and the phenomenon of deflation became more pronounced. According to a survey by the Bank of China, in June of this year, the amount of paper money issued by Shanghai banks was $182.380134 million, a difference of $99.595393 million compared to $281.975527 million in August of last year, a decrease of nearly one-half. There are no reliable statistics on the extent of capital contraction. However, the $500 million loss from last year's floods, the $1.5 billion loss from the Shanghai Incident, and the $100 million loss from blocked goods are all noteworthy in today's deflationary environment.</p>
<p>In economic theory, excessive inflation and excessive deflation can both lead to social instability. Extreme inflation can lead to bubble economies, ultimately resulting in a time of panic. Conversely, extreme deflation will inevitably lead to sharp price declines, industrial stagnation, and frequent unemployment. Therefore, enlightened people in China today advocate saving, reducing consumption, and eliminating non-productive [credit] to alleviate the current and future harm of deflation. However, the imbalance of China's economy today has myriad causes and is extremely complex, not just due to waste and the expansion of non-productive credit.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Ma Zhanshan Cables Report on Combat Operations, Preparing for a Major Counteroffensive Against the Japanese Army <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Guerrilla Forces on the Outskirts of Shenyang Bombard Arsenal and Airfield</p>
<p>Japanese Army and Guerrilla Forces Engage in Artillery Battles Across the Hun River All Day Long</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan's telegram from the 30th states: "Since passing through Hu Hai at the end of June, I have led my troops forward to Suileng, Dongxing, Qingcheng, and other counties. The battle situation is as follows: (1) On July 7th, our army encountered over 900 enemy infantry and six aircraft northwest of Dongxing County, engaging in fierce fighting until the evening, when the enemy retreated. (2) On the 22nd, 600 enemy infantry and four mortars surrounded our 7th Engineer Company, engaging in several hours of fierce fighting, with the enemy leaving behind over 30 bodies before retreating. (3) On the 25th, when our army was crossing the river at the Yang Yong River mouth, two enemy aircraft and about 500 infantry, cavalry, and artillery launched a rear attack. We fought against the river, shooting down one enemy aircraft, and the enemy was defeated and suffered heavy losses. (4) On the 27th, Wu Songlin, the brigade commander of our cavalry, led the 4th Regiment to Wang Rong Temple, engaging over 400 enemies in seven hours of fierce fighting, killing dozens of them, and the enemy retreated. (5) On the 28th, Zhang, the regimental commander of our cavalry, and Liu, the battalion commander of our engineers, engaged over 600 enemy infantry and cavalry at Shixiaying, fighting day and night, with the enemy leaving behind over 40 bodies before retreating. (6) On the morning of the 29th, when my troops were marching near the forest south of Fuyuan Shop, they encountered over 1,000 enemy infantry, cavalry, and artillery, who surrounded them from all sides. My troops fought bravely, engaging in fierce battles until night, defeating the enemy. The enemy suffered particularly heavy casualties this time, and the fighting was the fiercest. Our losses were also significant. My face was also injured by shrapnel in this battle, but it has fully recovered. On August 5th, we marched to Badaohezi, and were again attacked by six enemy aircraft and over 500 cavalry, engaging in half a day of fierce fighting, killing over 100 enemies, and we only suffered 11 casualties of officers and soldiers. On the 14th, we occupied the county seat of Tongbei. (7) According to the report from Southern Commander Tingfang, on July 20th, the county seat of Dedu was captured. In total, although the stubborn enemy has not been eliminated in the above battles, the repeated fierce battles have frightened the enemy. Moreover, aircraft are unique to the enemy, and our army lacks air defense and air control capabilities. Otherwise, although our firearms are not as sophisticated as the enemy's, the morale of our officers and soldiers is extremely high. I am currently in a certain location, ordering Deng and other southern units to launch separate actions, planning a major counteroffensive soon." (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Stray Bullets Fly Within Shenyang City <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The guerrilla forces attacking Shenyang are still in the areas of Gujiazi, Wujiatun, Qianjinzai, and Hun River on the outskirts of Shenyang, engaging in fierce battles with Japanese troops and police. The guerrilla forces continue to bombard the arsenal, aircraft factory, and Beidaying with artillery, causing fires in several places within Shenyang City. Stray bullets are flying everywhere, causing extreme panic. Qi Enming, the chief of the Shenyang puppet police department, has been arrested by the Japanese for allegedly colluding with the guerrilla forces. Puppet officials are all in a panic. One unit of the guerrilla forces attacking Shenyang retreated to Wangjuntun, Dongling, and Lixiazai on the morning of the 1st, with about 500 people. Japanese aircraft pursued and bombed them, destroying many buildings, but the guerrilla forces suffered no major losses. Tianxiahao's unit retreated to the Hun River, concentrating in Masanjiazi, and attacking Shenyang City from time to time. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) The guerrilla forces have temporarily retreated to the areas of Shilihe, Nantai, Tantawan, and Qianjinzai on the outskirts of Shenyang, echoing the guerrilla forces in Fushun, causing the enemy to be attacked from both sides. Recently, residents of Shenyang have been innocently killed by Japanese invaders, likely numbering several. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Shanhaiguan) The guerrilla forces that occupied Zhan Yu a few days ago have advanced on multiple routes to Taonan, Zhengjiatun, and Siping Street, engaging in fierce battles with Japanese police and Zhang Haipeng's rebel army in Kaitong, Taipingchuan, Xinghong Street, and other places.

<p>(Tianjin) A person from Yixian reported that Ma Zidan, commander of the 8th Independent Division of the National Salvation Army, led by Zhu Jiqing, learned that the Japanese army planned to invade Rehe from the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Railway. On the night of August 18th, he sent a team to dismantle the rails near the Nanling Station northwest of Chaoyang Temple and south of Xuedong. The enemy dispatched over 30 armed Japanese and Koreans, and over 60 traitors, on armored vehicles to repair the rails, resulting in a fierce battle. Ma's troops almost completely annihilated the enemy traitors and intercepted two armored vehicles. On the 19th, the Japanese army clashed with Tang's troops. Ma also joined forces with the militia in the area of Aoluotai in Yixian to contain the enemy's rear, preventing the enemy from daring to go deep. This battle was indeed one of the most impressive scenes of the volunteer army in western Liaoning recently. (2nd Dispatch from the China United News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e13">Gu Weijun Arrived in Nanjing by Plane Yesterday <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Italian Envoy Ciano Arrived with Him</p>
<p>Plans to Fly to Wuhan Today to Meet Chiang and Luo</p>
<p>Decided to Set Sail with Lytton and Others</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun, accompanied by Italian Envoy Ciano, Secretary Xiao Jirong, Yu Guanxiong, Gu Shanchang, and others, arrived in Nanjing at 1:00 PM on a Ford plane from Beiping. Those welcoming him at the airfield included Vice Foreign Minister Xu Mo, Director-General of General Affairs Yin Shangde, and Xiang Zhejun, secretary of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. After Gu got off the plane, he shook hands with those who welcomed him as a courtesy. He then went to the foreign ministry official residence for lunch. Italian Envoy Ciano needed to go to Shanghai urgently due to business and left Nanjing by the original plane at 2:00 PM. After lunch at the diplomatic residence, Gu immediately went to see President Wang to report on the progress of our delegation's work in Beiping and the situation of the League of Nations Investigation Team compiling the report, and to discuss the main policies that our side should adopt when the League of Nations General Assembly convenes. At 4:30 PM, he went to the Lixingshe with Xu Mo to rest and meet with the press. It is reported that Gu plans to use this half-day to request a decision on the entire strategy of foreign affairs with Japan and the recovery of the Eastern Provinces. On the morning of the 3rd, he will fly to Wuhan to meet with Chiang and Luo, and on the 4th, he will fly to Shanghai to set sail with Sir Lytton and his party on the 5th. Sir Lytton and his party are scheduled to fly from Beiping to Shanghai on the 4th to catch the outward-bound ship on the 5th, and they hope that our diplomatic authorities will have another meeting. The government has appointed Song Ziwen to receive them in Shanghai, and Luo Wen'gan is also scheduled to fly to Shanghai with Gu Weijun on the 4th to meet with Lytton. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei held a banquet for Gu Weijun at the No. 1 official residence of the Ministry of Railways at 4:30 PM on the 2nd, with the Central Committee members and ministers of various departments in Nanjing in attendance to discuss the diplomatic policy towards Japan in detail. Gu told reporters at the Lixingshe that whether the future of Sino-Japanese diplomacy is optimistic depends on the rapidly changing situation of the League of Nations and the different interests of various countries, so it is difficult to predict in advance. However, our country has always trusted the League of Nations and will strive to find a fair solution. The League of Nations' only mission is to measure international equality, and the purpose of the investigation team's visit to China is to seek the realization of this spirit. The League of Nations General Assembly and the Executive Yuan will naturally make peaceful and fair decisions based on the investigation team's report. The Japanese side's attitude towards the League of Nations is insincere, which has become obvious. However, everyone believes that Japan will hardly disregard international treaties in the end. In other words, Japan will find it difficult to survive apart from other countries. As far as I can tell, its stubborn attitude seems difficult to change in the end. If the League of Nations resolution is extremely fair and Japan still does not accept it, I am afraid it will be unforgivable by world opinion. It must be known that the power of public opinion far exceeds that of warships and bombs. Regarding Japan's preparation to withdraw from the League of Nations, the Japanese press and government have been promoting it a lot, but the true attitude of their government is not necessarily all that. The Japanese side is accustomed to using propaganda policies, especially on diplomatic issues. Even if they withdraw from the League of Nations, it will be difficult to avoid the collective condemnation of world opinion. The representatives of the investigation team are unwilling to express their opinions on Foreign Minister Uchida's speech due to their position, but private comments are inevitable. However, because I am a member of the investigation team, for the sake of good faith, I am not convenient to announce it, even if I have heard it. But I believe that no country can sympathize with rights acquired by military aggression. The fact that US Secretary of State Stimson's speech was able to win worldwide sympathy proves this. The East and West countries do not have the same interests and feelings towards Japan's preparation to recognize the puppet regime, and it is still difficult to predict what attitude they will take in the future. As for the rumors of a Japan-France-Britain alliance, I believe that although Japan has the ambition to invade our country, other countries do not have the same mentality because it is of no benefit to them. If they help country A illegally seize the rights of country B, and turn themselves into the object of the world's jealousy, even a fool would not do this. Regarding the issue of the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, I have repeatedly contributed my opinions to the central government on the advantages and disadvantages of this, but because it involves diplomatic secrets, it is not convenient to tell you before it is implemented. The contents of the League of Nations Investigation Team's report are confidential. The committee members have agreed to not disclose it to the outside world before it is submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly in order to avoid disputes. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shuren said: 1.

There is no proposal in the central government to welcome Sun, nor has anyone been sent to Guangdong to welcome Sun. 3. Wang will definitely not leave Beijing to go elsewhere. 4.

The government is not convenient to stop the patriotic movements of the people, but the government should take action against any actions that deviate from the right track. Therefore, all movements should follow the right track to avoid giving foreigners an excuse. As for the rumors of Japanese warships coming to China, they are completely the Japanese side's spreading of rumors, and they are not true. The central government is carefully planning our diplomatic policy and how to deal with the Northeast issue. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Mayor Wu's Attempt to Maintain Peace</p>
<p>May Not Be Able to Restrain Japan's Ambitions</p>
<p>▲Reuter's, London, 2nd - Mayor Wu Tiecheng's announcement banning anti-Japanese outrages was prominently featured in today's Times. Well-informed sources in London were deeply gratified by this, as news of increasingly tense relations between China and Japan has frequently reached here recently, and the Geneva crisis is imminent. Some argue that Mayor Wu's acceptance of Japanese demands last year failed to prevent the Japanese army from entering Zhabei, so what good is this article today? However, there is widespread hope that the situation has not become so tense that Mayor Wu's advice will be ineffective. A Reuters reporter met with Minister Quo Tai-chi, who said that he felt Mayor Wu's attempt to maintain peace was made more difficult by recent developments in the Japanese parliament. The British authorities are silent on the developments in Shanghai, but are closely monitoring them.</p>

<p>To Conclude a Treaty of Alliance with the Puppet</p>
<p>Stipulating Japan's Right to Station Troops in the Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>British Newspapers Believe This Move Will Only Increase Mutual Resentment Between China and Japan</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd - According to reliable sources, the defense alliance treaty signed between Japan and [Manchukuo] has already been signed and will take effect before the 15th of this month. The treaty stipulates mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. [Manchukuo] allows Japan to station troops throughout Manchuria, and Japan is responsible for the internal and external defense of [Manchukuo]. Apart from stationing troops, Japan is not granted any new rights, only old rights are confirmed. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on the treaty, saying that there is no issue of establishing a protectorate in the treaty, and that [Manchukuo] enjoys complete freedom in diplomacy and finance. It is also said that the two countries will soon conclude a military agreement stipulating all the details. The new treaty does not contain any secret clauses. The treaty will be sent to major countries before it is signed. It has not yet been decided whether the treaty will be registered with the League of Nations. The spokesman also said that the treaty is called the Japan-Manchukuo Agreement, and the wording is extremely simple. The entire treaty has only one sentence and occupies one and a half pages in length. The cabinet has approved the treaty, and the Privy Council will consider it next week, and then it will be submitted to the Emperor for approval. After this routine procedure, General Muto, the newly appointed commander of the Japanese army in Manchuria, will be ordered to sign it in Changchun, which will take effect immediately, and it has already been approved by the Emperor before signing, so there is no need to initial it. It is expected that after the treaty is signed, Muto will be appointed as the Japanese ambassador to [Manchukuo].</p>
<p>▲United Press, Tokyo, 2nd - The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from the Japanese personnel in Peiping, stating that the Lytton Report values reason and undervalues the current situation created by force, which is detrimental to Japan. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs then decided to sign a treaty with the pseudo-organization and officially recognize it before the League of Nations Council meeting. According to a statement from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the press corps, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will submit the newly signed treaty between Japan and the pseudo-organization to the Privy Council in the next two or three days, seeking its review, and then seeking the Emperor's consent. Major General Itagaki (formerly a senior staff officer of the Kwantung Army), the advisor to the executive of the pseudo-state, will take it back to Changchun and discuss it with Commander Muto. It will then be signed by Pu Yi as a formal recognition. The date will be before September 15th.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 2nd - The Daily Mail this morning carried a headline in large letters: [New Danger of Sino-Japanese War], with a dispatch from Shenyang stating that the [Manchukuo] authorities have organized a committee, headed by its foreign minister, to negotiate a defense alliance treaty with Japan. The Daily Mail calls this an [ominous] development, fearing that it will cause renewed hostility between China and Japan. The Shenyang news also said that if the treaty is concluded, it will give Japan full power to govern the Manchurian army. The report concluded that a large-scale war seems inevitable.</p>

<p>The Toyo Keizai Lists Seven Difficulties for America</p>
<p>Implying that France, Britain and Russia Will Side With Japan</p>
<p>▲Osaka Mainichi Shimbun writes, because Japan's diplomatic policy is established, causing America's Far East policy to waver. Namely: (1) The general public believes that Secretary of State Stimson places too much emphasis on logic, which will inevitably lead to a major deterioration in US-Japan relations. (2) According to reports from the United States, the Lytton Report will be unfavorable to Japan. As a result, when the United States cooperates with the League, the United States will inevitably be the leader and hold the reins of the League, and Britain and France will also cooperate with the United States in the League. To this end, various countries will also consider other interests. This is the only position for the United States to make public, and it is in a dilemma. (3) If the investigation team's report is favorable to Japan, the United States will only be resented by Japan and fall into isolation. (4) According to information obtained from London, Paris and other places, the attitudes of the United Kingdom, France and the United States are very different. Also, the recent friendly relations between Russia and Japan are another cause for concern for the United States. However, whether the United States will be isolated in the future or Japan will be isolated is still difficult to predict. (5) If Stimson's theory is to be implemented, the United States will have no choice but to resort to war, but the United States is the initiator of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, so there is no reason to use force to solve the problem. (6) Stimson and President Hoover do not agree. If Hoover is re-elected in the next presidential election, Stimson may not be able to stay in office. From the above points of view, American diplomacy is encountering major difficulties in this League meeting. Therefore, the United States is trying to shift its direction and break the new opportunity of the current situation. Currently, the State Department is keeping silent before the League meeting, but the fact that the Atlantic Fleet has postponed its concentration in the Pacific and the recent precise investigation of the Aleutian Islands airfields in the Pacific Ocean are worthy of our attention.</p>

<p>Inherently Stupid and Lacking Unity</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Heildel, 1st - It is heard that the Soviet Russian International Committee has decided to stop propaganda among people of color in the United States. This move has aroused protests from representatives of people of color attending the meeting. The headquarters of the committee issued an article explaining the reasons for this decision, saying that people of color are inherently stupid, making unity impossible. This can be seen in the recent fighting between Fijians and West Indians in New York. These people are short-sighted, like the Hindus and Muslims in India. Therefore, the committee now believes that it is more appropriate to shift its attention to the more civilized European proletarians, and no longer waste time and money on the useless work of enlightening the congenitally foolish.</p>

The newspapers also speak highly of the importance of the conference, and say that the German government had previously proposed practical suggestions for the economic recovery of the Danube countries, but with the condition that the considered plan is not limited to the countries of Southeastern Europe, and that in practice, special attention should be paid to the natural markets of Germany and Italy, such as the Southeastern countries.</p>

<p>And the Amendment of the Treaty of Versailles</p>
<p>Negotiations with France Alone</p>
<p>The Consequences of the Lausanne and Geneva Conferences</p>
<p>Britain Expresses Temporary Non-Participation in the Discussion</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 1st - Regarding Germany's negotiations in Paris to reorganize the German army and amend the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, the British government may not participate in these negotiations at present, but the French and German governments will notify the British government of the details at any time. Because Germany's move is a direct result of the Lausanne Anglo-French Agreement, and all major European countries abide by this agreement, Germany is speaking in its own name, but can be regarded as speaking on behalf of the entire body. A dispatch from Berlin said that Germany did not send a formal note to France. Only Foreign Minister Neurath and the French ambassador to Germany recently discussed the matter in Berlin. The reason for this conversation was that French Prime Minister Herriot had agreed in Lausanne and Geneva to listen to Germany's demands for military equality in August. Therefore, Neurath recorded his views in the conversation and sent them to the French ambassador for reference. According to Berlin sources, the reason why Germany is negotiating with France alone is that all the governments gathered in Geneva and Lausanne, except France, agree with Germany's demand for military equality. Anglo-French cooperation is the main focus of Herriot's policy, so Herriot may not make a decision until he consults with London. Furthermore, the Treaty of Versailles is related to the League of Nations, so in any case, this matter will take a long time to exchange views diplomatically. The details of Germany's demands have not been disclosed in Paris. It is heard that Germany wants to have an army of 300,000, heavy artillery units, and tank units, as well as a larger navy, and wants to establish 35 factories for manufacturing military equipment. Paris news said that the memorandum on military equality sent by Germany has been considered by the cabinet for three and a half hours. After the meeting, a concise communiqué was issued, stating only that the Prime Minister had reported to the cabinet on the foreign situation. Le Débat of Paris learned from reliable sources the outline of the contents of the German memorandum. According to the newspaper, the memorandum contains numbers and details, but asks France to have a frank and confidential conversation so that the agreement can be concluded. If France is willing, Germany will notify Britain and the United States, so that the two countries can also participate in the discussion. The memorandum clearly states the necessity of finding a basic method to reduce armaments and ensure the security of all countries, and declares that Germany will do its best to assist in this regard, but Germany must also consider its own security in national defense. Germany is willing to abolish military weapons that are prohibited by other countries, but Germany should also have the right to use those that are permitted by other countries. The newspaper also said that a copy of the German memorandum will now be sent to other countries. Before the cabinet meeting, Paris newspapers all issued calls for a firm response, but Prime Minister Herriot urged people to remain calm and cautious after the cabinet meeting, as this document still needs to be carefully studied.</p>

<p>The Nazi Party and the National People's Party are Incompatible</p>
<p>▲Kokumin, Berlin, 1st - The representatives of the German National People's Party and the Nazi Party have now issued a joint communiqué, which is the first time since the two parties have negotiated. There is nothing exciting in the text. It only says that negotiations will continue to consolidate the internal political situation in Germany in order to restore trust at home and abroad and prevent Germany from being isolated in Europe. This move is necessary, etc. The truth of the negotiations and their possible results cannot be determined from this communiqué. However, the incompatibility between the German National People's Party and the Nazi Party is becoming more and more serious. Today, Hugenberg's organ newspaper declared that Vice President of the Reichstag Graf would do his best to oppose Nazi Party President Goering's attempt to pressure the President with his political views. It means that the National People's Party intends to persuade the President not to easily believe Goering's remarks in the Reichstag speech on Tuesday that the Reichstag already has a cooperative majority.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 1st - Nazi Party leader Hitler delivered a speech to 12,000 people here tonight, which was extremely impassioned and made the audience excited. Goering, the new president of the Reichstag, accompanied Hitler. Guards were stationed around the platform, and Agnew William, the son of the abolished German Emperor, was also among the guards. This was the first day after the end of the political truce. Hitler took this opportunity to strongly criticize the government and attack Prime Minister von Papen and his aristocratic party, saying that their attempt to reverse the tide would fail. Germany would eventually tend to align with the Nazi Party, and at that time the Nazi Party would take on the task of German innovation. Hitler denied the claim that he would join the Papen cabinet, saying that we will take over the government, which is our right. We do not need the army to guarantee us, the country itself is backing us. Hitler went on to mention the age gap between him and Hindenburg, saying that even if he hears them dissolve the Reichstag a hundred times, we will soon win because we have the strongest power. The audience cheered until they were exhausted.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 2nd – Five National Socialist Party members sentenced to death for killing a Communist Party member have now been pardoned. Their death sentences have been commuted to life imprisonment with hard labor. The announcement of the death sentences for these five individuals caused a major uproar in Germany, becoming one of the biggest conflicts between the National Socialist Party and the government. National Socialist Party leader Hitler championed these five, and the clamor for their pardon spread throughout the nation. The authorities' decision not to impose the death penalty on these individuals is due to this reason.</p>

<p>▲ Regulations on Opium Addiction Treatment – Commander-in-Chief Chiang, considering that personnel and students in Party, government, and military services in the three provinces are addicted to opium and seem unwilling to change, has issued strict orders to quit opium within a specified time limit. He has specially stipulated measures for opium addiction treatment. On the 31st, he sent letters to the Party departments, high courts, and schools in the provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, ordering each pacification headquarters, provincial government, army, and division to comply. The original letter stated: [Opium is deeply poisonous. Once addicted, it erodes ambition, ruins reputation, destroys careers, and devastates the body. It is harmful in every way to individuals and society. The people of our country are drinking poison willingly, without the slightest awareness. Every time I think about this, I feel deeply pained. The personnel of our Party, government, and military services are models for the people, and our young students are the backbone of society. If they do not improve themselves and become addicted to this evil habit, it will inevitably lead to national destruction, racial extermination, and personal ruin. The Commander-in-Chief deeply knows that many social evils originate from opium. If we want to transform society and reverse the decline, we must thoroughly and quickly ban it, especially starting with personnel in Party, government, and military services and students.

<h3 id="e73">Investigation of Embezzlement of Dike Funds by Hubei High Court <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Wuchang District Court Handles Case Without Corruption</p>
<p>Liu Wenjin Returns to Custody Awaiting Trial by the District Court</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondent: The case of Liu Wenjin, the former accountant of the Hubei Dike Project Expenditure Management Committee, and Cha Wenqu, the manager of the local merchant Chuanjianglong Company, jointly embezzling dike funds, has been pending for over a year without resolution. This time, Zhang Nanxian secretly investigated the case and learned that the suspect Liu had been released on bail by the Wuchang District Court. He reported this to Commander-in-Chief Chiang on suspicion of illegal release. He ordered the arrest of the Chief Prosecutor of the court, Hu Shu, for interrogation by the High Court. Coincidentally, Liu Wenjin arrived to surrender. The investigation revealed that the Wuchang District Court did not appear to be corrupt. Yesterday, the High Court reported the progress of the investigation to Commander-in-Chief Chiang. The original text is as follows: [Report on the matter of reporting the progress of handling the case of Liu Wenjin's embezzlement, as reported by Li Shi’en, the Acting Chief Prosecutor of the Wuchang District Court, requesting review and forwarding. This office received an order from your office on April 2nd and April 18th, which was forwarded by the Hubei Provincial Government, regarding the investigation of the case of Liu Wenjin's embezzlement, along with eleven copies of documents and the suspect Liu Wenjin. Prosecutor Chen Zhenggang was assigned to investigate according to law. During repeated interrogations, Liu Wenjin stated that the deposits of Chuanjianglong were transferred to me by the previous accountant, Li Wenbao, and were promissory notes. I have submitted the transfer document to the Provincial Government, and there is a receipt from the General Affairs Section of the Provincial Government as proof. He also claimed that he did not embezzle over 36,000 yuan of dike funds, but only embezzled over 5,000 yuan. He sold 3,280 yuan of property to repay the embezzled funds, which he submitted to the Provincial Government. There is a receipt from the Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau for receiving the title deeds of the land and houses. He still owed over 1,800 yuan, which he transferred to the subsequent accountant, He Zhidao, when he was detained. He also provided a receipt from the Hubei Provincial Bank and two promissory notes from the Xucheng Qianzhuang, totaling 5,631 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen, which can be verified by He Zhidao's receipt. He added that his confession was evasive, and Cha Wenqu, a person involved in the case, was summoned for interrogation. The bailiff reported that Cha Wenqu had absconded with dike funds and his whereabouts were unknown. On June 27th, we sent a letter to the Hubei Provincial Government to verify whether the payment claimed by Liu Wenjin was true, and how the interest of over 22,100 yuan was embezzled, requesting a prompt reply for verification. Later, Liu Wenjin claimed that he had been detained for two years due to a one-sided accusation and requested the detention to be stopped according to law. We checked that Liu Wenjin had been in custody since April 2nd, and by June 1st, the detention period had reached two months. We applied for an extension of the detention period for two months according to Article 73, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, deducting it until August 1st. The extended period had also expired. According to Article 73, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law, further detention would be illegal. The case was complicated, and it was not appropriate to prosecute without a reply from the Hubei Provincial Government. Therefore, on August 1st, in accordance with the provisions of Article 75, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2, and Article 76 of the Criminal Procedure Law, we entrusted the accused Liu Wenzhan to Chen Dinghua, the manager of Hankou Dingfeng Hardware Store, and Li Qinlian, the manager of Xintai Mining Farm, two reputable guarantors, and ordered them to pay a deposit of 1,000 yuan, with the requirement that they be available at any time. Later, on August 11th, the Hubei Provincial Government replied, only stating that it had instructed the Hubei Dike Project Expenditure Management Committee to investigate and reply, and would forward it according to the situation upon receipt. It was not until August 16th that the Hubei Provincial Government forwarded the Hubei Dike Project Expenditure Management Committee's copy, along with three attachments. With the facts now clear, we drafted an indictment on August 20th. On one hand, we limited the bail to ensure Liu Wenjin's return, and on the other hand, we organized the case file. On August 27th, we first transferred it to the Criminal Court of our court for review. Liu Wenjin was bound on August 28th and transferred to the Criminal Court for custody on August 29th. This is the situation of our office in handling the case of Liu Wenjin's embezzlement. We hereby submit this document to your office for review and forwarding to the Judicial Administration Department and the General Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. This is for public convenience. Based on this, our office first sent Prosecutor Yang Gong to the Wuchang District Court Prosecutor's Office on the 26th to review the case file of Liu Wenjin and personally consulted the prosecutor Chen Zhenggang in charge of the case. His statement was consistent with the original report. Now, after further questioning the defendant Liu Wenjin, he stated that the detention period expired on August 1st, and he submitted a request for bail and paid a deposit of 1,000 yuan, which was true. There was no solicitation of favors or spending for influence. From the situation provided by the defendant Liu Wenjin, it appears that the Wuchang District Court Prosecutor's Office did not handle this case corruptly. The defendant Liu Wenjin has now arrived and is awaiting trial by the Criminal Court of the Wuchang District Court. In addition to a separate report to the Judicial Administration Department, we hereby submit this report for your review. Respectfully submitted to Chiang, the Chairman of the Military Commission and the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. ] (September 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Jiangsu Construction Department Coordinates Provincial Highway Construction <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Concentrating Resources for Overall Development</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Province highway expenditure comes mostly from the farmland tax collected by various counties to be used for road construction. The funds are managed by the county construction bureaus and are specifically used for road construction. However, over the years, the road construction in various counties has been mostly independent and not interconnected. The roads built are mostly branch lines within the counties, and the main lines connecting the traffic of various counties have not been started, so the network cannot be connected. Therefore, over four or five years, hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent, but the roads in the province rarely have a connected and smooth effect. This spring, the Shanghai Incident led to frequent military transportation in the rear, and the counties rushed to build military roads, as urgent as sparks, showing even more that the previous road construction work was not in accordance with the meaning of prioritizing urgency. The Jiangsu Construction Department has seen this and is planning to improve, because the province's highways are an overall cause that must be planned by the province as a whole, and the major trunk lines connecting the various counties must be built first to meet the current needs, and the branch lines of the counties will not be limited to one corner, with no way to reach all directions. The department previously suggested to the provincial government that from July of the 21st year, all the road construction funds collected from the farmland tax in various counties should be turned over to the province by half and stored in special funds for the construction of major trunk road projects throughout the province. The purpose is to concentrate financial resources to develop the province's highways as a whole and remedy the past problems of fragmented and divisive branches. The case was resolved by the provincial government and implemented accordingly. The Construction Department also formulated regulations for reporting and remitting funds and table formats for weekly and monthly reports, and notified all counties to report and remit funds on schedule to meet the needs of the project. Recently, it has been heard that after the counties received the order, more than 40 counties have replied and are complying with the regulations for reporting and remitting funds. More than 10 counties have begun to submit weekly and monthly reports. It is also heard that 15 counties have remitted half of the funds collected in July to the Construction Department for verification and receipt.</p>

<p>Detailed Account of the Sealing of the Moxie Newspaper – The Moxie Newspaper in this county was sealed by Zhou Wenqing, a special agent sent by the county government, and the director of the newspaper, Zhu Tieying, was arrested and imprisoned. County Magistrate Zhao personally interrogated him and sentenced Zhu to one year of imprisonment and a fine of 100 yuan. The reason for Zhu's arrest was that the newspaper published news and commentary on the collection of business tax inspectors and a second accusation against Hu Jiacong, the director of the business tax bureau. County Magistrate Zhao believed that it incited merchants to resist national taxes, so he gave him the most severe punishment. After the incident, the whole city was in an uproar. The business community believed that Zhu's arrest was for pleading on behalf of the merchants, and unfortunately he was imprisoned. Qian Chunyi, the chairman of the county's business association, and committee member Lu Songlun met with the county magistrate to request bail and to request that the judgment be sent out as soon as possible, but both were rejected. The local newspaper industry believes that the principle of a journalist is to record everything that is heard, but he was suddenly detained, so all journalists are in danger. They jointly united and discussed rescue methods, and issued an urgent extra from all the newspapers in Taicang, announcing the truth of the case and the rescue situation, and asked all sectors to uphold justice and provide assistance.</p>

<p>▲ Requesting Clarification on the Truth of Public Opium Sales – The Wuxian National Anti-Drug Association stated that the public opium sales in Jiangsu Province are about to be realized, and a special commissioner Feng has come to Suzhou to negotiate everything with the county government. Under this clear blue sky, a strange play of openly selling opium is being staged. Legal sentiment and trust have been completely lost. Where are the late Premier's instructions placed? Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government, requesting clarification of the truth to dispel public doubts. The association also heard that the Jialu patrol ship of the Public Security Second District of the Water Police transported opium to Pingwang and other places in Wujiang, and plans to apply to the judicial organs to ban it when it is transported to Suzhou.</p>
<p>▲ Anti-Japanese Association Seizes Enemy Goods – The Wuxian Anti-Japanese Association sent personnel to the Hongsheng Match Company and seized 2,002 bundles of Japanese poplar wood, ordering the factory to not use it temporarily, and took a piece of poplar wood back for identification. In addition, the Shanghai Red Blood Anti-Traitor Group's Suzhou branch sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the Liuzao Silk Border Factory in Shilin Lane used all enemy wax threads, and asked them to send personnel to inspect and verify, stop work, and seal up the enemy goods, otherwise they would take strict measures.</p>
<p>▲ Traitor Hu Lifu Escorted to Suzhou – The Jiangsu High Court sent Secretary Pang and four police officers to Ning to escort the famous traitor Hu Lifu. They escorted the prisoner to Suzhou at 2:35 PM on the second. After getting off the train, they took a carriage to Xumen and walked into the city to the High Court, where he was taken into custody to await interrogation. Hu was wearing a light gray woolen short shirt, ecru Indian silk trousers, ecru silk socks, and ecru double-beam satin shoes, but his expression was panicked and his face haggard.</p>
<p>▲ Sun Yuan Released Yesterday – Sun Yuan, the director of the former San Francisco Consulate General in the Gao Ying opium trafficking case, had his sentence changed to imprisonment by the High Court after the prosecutor in the original trial appealed. He has now served his sentence, and the fine of 1,000 yuan has also been paid. Therefore, he was released from court yesterday (the 2nd).</p>

<p>▲ Young Girl Commits Suicide Due to Illness – Yuan Shenggen, a resident of Tangtou Middle Street in the Sixth District (Tianxiashi), had a daughter named Fengjin, who is now 19 years old. She was betrothed to a Zhou in the vicinity through her parents' arrangement and a matchmaker's words, but she has not yet married. Last year, Fengjin suddenly contracted tuberculosis and was bedridden for more than a year without recovery. Recently, she suddenly developed a sense of world-weariness. One night, taking advantage of the fact that no one was prepared, she secretly took scissors and stabbed herself fiercely in the throat, instantly causing blood to flow like a river and her breath to cease. By the time her family discovered it, it was too late to revive her. Yesterday morning, the village chief Chen Guozhu came to the city to report to the county court and requested an autopsy. Inspector Du brought officials to verify that it was self-inflicted and instructed the family to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Important Speech by Song <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Japanese Seizure of Customs in Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Finance Minister Song Zi-wen issued the following statement yesterday regarding the Japanese seizure of customs in the Eastern Provinces:</p>
<p>[Since the customs houses in the three northeastern provinces were forcibly taken over by Japan in March of this year, not a single penny has been remitted to the central government for debt repayment. Furthermore, not only that, but also two-thirds of the bank deposits in the name of the Inspector General of Customs before Japan seized the customs houses are still in the hands of Japan or the puppet state of Manchukuo. However, the Chinese government is still trying its best to continue paying various loans and indemnities, amounting to about 13 million taels of Shanghai silver per month. Japan completely disregards the interests of bondholders, so its international credibility has begun to decline. Now, if we compare the prices of two types of loans issued by the Chinese and Japanese governments that mature at the same time, we can see the general situation. The comparison is approximately as follows:</p>
<p>China's 5% Rehabilitation Loan, with a term from 1913 to 1960, was priced at 62 on April 1 of this year, around the time Japan began interfering with customs in the Eastern Provinces. However, by September 1 of this year, it had increased to 68.</p>
<p>Japan's 6% Gold Loan, with a term from 1924 to 1959, was priced at 79 on April 1 of this year, but by September 1 of this year, it had dropped to 68 and a half.</p>
<p>Based on the price on September 1, the interest rate on Chinese bonds is 7.8%, while the interest rate on Japanese bonds is about 9.2%. From this, it can be seen that the value of Chinese 5% bonds is now equal to the value of Japanese 6% bonds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Japanese News Agency recently published a statistical report compiled by the Kwantung Leased Territory Government, which stated that Dalian Customs revenue increased significantly in the first half of this year. Mr. Song also made the following remarks on this:</p>
<p>[If the customs revenue is calculated in silver, it has decreased. According to the report of the Inspector General of Customs, the total amount of customs revenue from January 1 to June 25 of this year, before Japan seized Dalian Customs, was 6,628,348 taels, 7 mace, and 1 fen of Haikwan silver. If calculated for a full six months, the total revenue should be in the range of 6,812,000 taels of Haikwan silver. This figure is actually 253,000 taels less than the customs revenue in the first half of last year, because the total revenue of Dalian Customs in the first half of last year was 7,065,713 taels and 4 fen of Haikwan silver. However, the Japanese report uses Japanese yen to calculate and indicate the increase in customs revenue. In fact, there is no increase in customs revenue, and it only makes people aware of the sharp fall in the price of Japanese yen. A year ago, each Japanese yen was worth 49 US cents, but today it has fallen to 22 and a half US cents. This is all due to the reckless actions of the Japanese warlords in Northeast China and Shanghai. From this, it can be seen that although Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida boasts that Manchuria can look forward to peace and prosperity, in reality, Japan's forcible occupation of the area has only caused a tragic fall in its currency value and made the domestic economy even more unsustainable,] etc.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Panic Among Citizens in Northern City Again Yesterday <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Authorities Vigorously Seek Ways to Quell Rumors</p>
<p>Recently, rumors have been rampant in this city, and people are panicking. Although both China and Japan have repeatedly stated that a second war will not occur in Shanghai, people still feel uneasy. In addition, at about 1:00 PM yesterday, two planes suddenly flew low over the Zhabei area, and those who like to make trouble added speculation, which further aroused the panic of the residents there. Residents living north of North Sichuan Road, Lao-ba-zi Road, Di-si-wei Road, and Zhabei have been moving to the central section of the foreign concessions since early yesterday morning. Until late at night, moving trucks were constantly on the road.</p>
<p>▲Mayor Wu's Remarks According to Mayor Wu Tie-cheng, who spoke to a Central News Agency reporter, the city's public security is as peaceful as usual. The rampant rumors are all speculation. As the mayor of Shanghai, he is responsible for maintaining the city's public security. He will use extremely strict measures to stop these baseless rumors in order to stabilize people's hearts. He is also deeply aware that a second war will not occur in this city, and the Japanese have no plans to create a second war in Shanghai. As for patriotic movements, they should also be brought back on track, otherwise patriotism will be enough to harm the country, etc.</p>
<p>▲Director Wen's Remarks Public Security Bureau Director Wen Ying-xing also stated responsibly yesterday that the tense atmosphere in Shanghai in recent days is all due to the public's gullible belief in rumors and self-inflicted disturbance. He is responsible for local public security. If there are any conspiracies to disrupt public security in various aspects, he will secretly investigate and report to the central government to seek a stop. As for the rumors that the Japanese will disrupt Shanghai again, he has not received any reports and cannot confirm them. Moreover, the Joint Committee can also come out to sanction any incidents. Therefore, he hopes that the public will deal with it calmly, etc.</p>
<p>▲Japan Issues Another Statement According to a Hualian News Agency report from Japan, there are many people moving in the Hongkou area. After Mayor Wu's statement was announced, the Japanese decided to remove the Japanese Telegraph Bureau's Marine Corps tomorrow morning. This afternoon, Commander Sugi-saka issued another statement stating:</p>

<p>Municipal Government Spokesman</p>
<p>Recently, there have been widespread rumors that the Japanese Marine Corps Commander protested to the Municipal Government about the publication of news about his troops' demonstrations in various newspapers and that he would take strict measures to deal with them. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter drove to the Municipal Government to inquire about the truth. A person in charge explained that this news was entirely fabricated by villains and was not true. He also said that reporters are responsible for guiding society and should also find ways to correct various records that are entirely fictitious and sufficient to disturb the public's psychology at any time, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Japanese Soldiers' Trucks Caused Disturbance at Nanjing Road Intersection Last Night <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Chinese and Western Detectives Arrived to Suppress</p>
<p>Beaten Child Temporarily Held in Police Station</p>
<p>At about 8:00 PM yesterday, about 70 or 80 Japanese Marine Corps soldiers, divided into two trucks, passed the Waibaidu Bridge. When they drove to the intersection of Huangpu-tan Road and Nanjing Road, the traffic light was red. Because the Japanese soldiers' trucks were eager to pass, they almost knocked down two children who were managing the tram tracks. A Chinese policeman on duty saw the situation and, because they violated the regulations, stepped forward to question them. The Japanese soldiers turned their anger on the two children, got out of the car and beat them. The Chinese policeman immediately stopped them. One of the children took the opportunity to escape. The soldiers arrested a child next to him and put him on the truck, hoping to drive away. At that time, there were many Chinese and foreigners watching, and they were all indignant when they saw the situation. A Westerner stepped forward to negotiate and was insulted by the Japanese soldiers. Therefore, the Westerners also became angry. One of the Westerners drove out his own car and blocked the road to prevent the Japanese trucks from moving. The Indian policeman managing the traffic lights also came forward to negotiate because the matter was about to escalate, causing the traffic there to be blocked immediately and the vehicles to be congested. The Chinese policeman immediately used the phone to report to the General Police Station, which immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to suppress the situation, trying to surround the soldiers, ordering them to get on the car and escort them to the police station. All Chinese and foreign witnesses and the beaten child also went to the police station with them. After questioning, the police station used the phone to notify the officer in charge and ordered him to escort them back. All the witnesses also signed out, but the beaten child was temporarily detained at the police station for detailed inquiry.</p>

From then on, Chinese merchant ships sailing to the Northeast will be subject to heavy restrictions, and the navigation rights of Yingkou and Andong ports may be completely lost to Japanese merchants at that time.</p>
<p>▲Tonnage Tax Will Be Levied in the Northeast After the Northeast Customs was seized, China has been chanting the slogan of a blockade policy, but it has been hesitant and has not yet been realized. Since the establishment of the puppet organization, it has not been recognized internationally. Therefore, although the customs of Yingkou, Andong, and other places have been forcibly occupied, they have never dared to collect import and export taxes and ship tonnage taxes, fearing international disputes. Therefore, Chinese and foreign merchant ships can still pass as before without any obstacles. Now, Japan rashly recognizes the puppet state. Within the scope of the Northeast, the ship tax, which the customs of Andong and Yingkou had planned but dared not implement, will be levied on Japanese ships starting from September 15. Ships that do not pay tonnage tax will be prohibited from entering the port.</p>
<p>▲Shipping Companies Must First Sign Commercial Treaties According to regulations, the passage of ships, whether between countries or the mutual trade of merchant ships, must first have a commercial treaty. Japan and the puppet organization have already signed a secret treaty, which is known to everyone. Now that it has recognized its country, all merchant ships sailing to the Northeast, regardless of British, American, or other countries' ships, will not be allowed to enter the ports of Andong and Yingkou until a commercial treaty is signed. At present, all countries in the world have not recognized the puppet state, let alone sign a commercial treaty. Therefore, foreign ships cannot sail to the northeastern ports. Taikoo, Jardine, and other companies in this city are also discussing and investigating this matter.</p>
<p>▲Problems Occur with Chinese Ships Among the Chinese merchant ships sailing to the Northeast are the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Zhao Xing, Zheng Ji, Yu Da, and Hai Chang companies. After the September 18th Incident last year, Zhao Xing, Yu Da, Hai Chang, Zheng Ji, and other ships employed Japanese crew members, added puppet state flags, and burned inferior northeastern coal, so they were allowed to sail. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Tu Nan" ship planned to sail to Yingkou last month. Because the shipowner was Chinese, he sent a telegram to inquire and received a reply, stopping him from going to avoid accidents. "Tu Nan" did not dare to go. In the future, after Japan recognizes the puppet state, it is feared that the Chinese ships such as Zhao Xing and Yu Da, which are allowed to sail, will also have problems, because China is the most vigorous denier of the puppet organization.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Ships Dominate The Northeast navigation rights will be exclusively dominated by Japanese merchant ships after September 15. The grains, medicinal materials, soybean oil, soybeans, and other items produced in the Northeast, which are transported to Europe and the United States every year, require hundreds of thousands of tons for soybeans alone, and there are also many routes to Shantou and Xiamen in China. In the past, ships from Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, were dispatched to load them. Now, since Chinese ships cannot go, foreign merchant ships will abandon the great shipping industry due to the issue of non-recognition. Then, the hundreds of thousands of tons of export goods every year will be transported exclusively by Japanese ships. Therefore, in the past year, Dalian, Osaka, Japan Mail Coastal Shipping, and others have added a large number of merchant ships, as if they knew there would be a September 18th Incident. Now they have all sent ships to the Northeast. The loss of the Northeast shipping industry, in terms of Chinese shipping alone, will result in a loss of at least 60 to 70 million yuan in freight every year.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Guo Cheng-en, New Director of the Central Mint, Took Office Yesterday <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Oath Ceremony Will Be Held After Official Minting Begins</p>
<p>Xu Ji, the director of the Central Mint, was approved to resign. After deliberation by the State Council, Guo Cheng-en was appointed as the successor. The new director, Guo, held a handover ceremony at the auditorium of the factory yesterday (the 2nd) morning and officially took office.</p>
<p>▲Participants All employees of the factory, from the deputy director downwards, participated. Because it was not a formal inauguration ceremony, all the ceremonies were simple. After the ceremony, Vice Director Wei Jing-zhou gave a welcome speech on behalf of all the employees. The speech briefly stated that today is the day when the new director of the factory, Director Guo, came to the factory to take office. All the staff and workers of the factory should express their utmost welcome. Director Guo has served as the director of the Hanyang Iron Works, the director of the Shanghai Arsenal, the director of the Ordnance Department, and the director of the Lianglu Railway Bureau. He has excellent qualifications and knowledge. This time, he was ordered to come to the factory, and we are deeply grateful for his appointment. We are even more fortunate to have a good leader. Therefore, the welcome of our colleagues cannot be expressed in words. I have weak talents and hold the position of deputy director. Not only am I personally willing to do my best to assist the director, but I also hope that all colleagues in the factory will work hard for the public and live up to the long-term expectations of the factory. Then,</p>
<p>Guo delivered a training speech, which briefly stated: I was ordered by the National Government to come to this factory as director, and I am deeply afraid that my knowledge and experience are insufficient and that I am not up to the task. Although I have previously held engineering and mechanical positions, I have little research on the situation of minting. Fortunately, among the colleagues in this factory, there are many old classmates of my brothers who will be able to provide me with good assistance. The opening of the mint is not far away, and I have two hopes for the minting of new coins: (1) The fineness of the new coins must be accurate; (2) The minting methods should be economical. Fortunately, all the minting machines in this factory are not only the best in all mints in China, but also comparable to those in Europe and the West. It is expected that the output will be fast and the fineness will be complete in the future. At the same time, brothers also have two hopes for the colleagues in this factory: 1. Abide by the office procedures. The definition of the word "procedure" is discipline in the army, school rules in the school, and factory rules in the factory. If all colleagues and workers can earnestly listen to the instructions of superiors, then the goal of order and neatness can be achieved. 2. It is necessary to have a spirit of cooperation. If there are only a few people in this factory, such as the director, deputy director, and section chiefs, it is impossible to successfully run a factory. All colleagues and workers must sacrifice personal selfishness, be open and honest, communicate with each other, and cooperate to achieve success. The most important thing is to understand that this factory is a factory with a business nature. All colleagues should recognize this point and must not have any official habits. All political activities must be put out of mind, and we must concentrate on factory affairs in order to increase the output and improve the fineness of new coins. I have high hopes.</p>
<p>It is reported that Director Guo will hold a supplementary oath ceremony when the factory officially starts minting.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Dutch Refund of Boxer Indemnity Agreement <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Signing Can Be Done When Instructions Arrive</p>
<p>After negotiations between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Dutch Minister, the agreement on the refund of the Dutch Boxer Indemnity has been drafted. The agreement can be formally signed after both parties request instructions and receive them. However, the Dutch side requires that there be a way to deal with Sino-Dutch public and private loans. As for the amount of the Dutch Boxer Indemnity previously reported, according to personnel from the Customs, there is a slight error. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Signing Soon According to a person in the Shanghai diplomatic community yesterday, the Dutch Boxer Indemnity agreement is currently under instruction from both parties. Our side generally has no major problems. The agreement can only take effect after the Dutch government's instructions arrive and both parties formally sign it. However, it is not yet known whether the agreement is a refund by the Dutch side or an abandonment. When the Sino-Dutch Boxer Indemnity issue was handled by Dutch Minister Oudendijk, he was instructed by his government in October of the Republic of China's 14th year to send a note to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressing goodwill and willingness to abandon the remainder of the Dutch portion of the Boxer Indemnity and use the full amount of the funds for the purpose of governing the Yellow River waterway in China. The Netherlands may send one or two engineers and attach a supervisory committee to handle the matter. After a joint meeting of the three ministries of foreign affairs, finance, and interior affairs in our country, it was completely stalled due to the many affairs in our country. It is not yet clear whether the current agreement is a separate refund method drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Dutch Minister, or whether it is still based on the previous agreement to abandon the remainder. The authorities have not clearly stated. If it is an abandonment, then the current balance is not much, which is not as good as the balance in the 14th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>▲Accurate Amount of Dutch Funds The total amount of the Dutch Boxer Indemnity and the years for repayment listed in the previous newspapers are slightly different. The accurate amount obtained by the reporter of the New Sound News Agency from the investigation of the Customs is recorded as follows. The total amount of the Boxer Indemnity of various countries is determined according to the customs taels of our country, and the total amount is 450,000,000 taels, which is approximately equivalent to 67,500,000 gold pounds. The interest rate is 4% per annum. The Dutch portion is 782,100 taels, which is approximately equivalent to 1,404,651.6 Dutch guilders, calculated at 1.796 guilders per tael. The total amount of principal and interest is estimated to be 3,066,005.289 guilders. The repayment period is 39 years, not 29 years, from 1902 to 1940. During the European War, our country joined the Allied Powers, and various countries agreed to suspend payment for five years. However, because the Netherlands did not join the Allied Powers, it did not suspend payment. Our country has always paid as usual. As of last year, a total of 2,102,957.92 guilders have been paid, and 963,047.369 guilders are still unpaid.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>▲Loan Amounts The establishment of the agreement is heard to have been expressed by the Dutch side that there must be a way to deal with Sino-Dutch public and private loans. According to the results of the New Sound News Agency's investigation by the Customs, it is known that there are only two Sino-Dutch loans. One is two transfer promissory notes from the Dutch Bank in February of the Republic of China's 7th year, totaling 427,139.76 taels of silver. By December 31 of the Republic of China's 14th year, the principal and interest had increased to 739,768.29 taels. After Yu Hede repeatedly contacted the government, it was changed to a loan. This is a private loan. The other is an amount of 17,725.89 guilders that the Dutch government took care of and paid on behalf of our country when sending back German, Austrian, and other overseas Chinese who had passed through the Netherlands in December of the Republic of China's 9th year. The interest is 89 cents. The amount should have been paid by Germany, Austria, and other countries, but because it was a time of war, our country could not contact Germany, Austria, and other countries, so it was temporarily paid by our country.</p>

<p>Exploded on the Spot... Fortunately No One Was Injured</p>
<p>Rong Chang Xiang Clock and Watch and Glasses Store at No. 128 Fujian Road has been open for more than ten years. The owner, Wan Rong, is from Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, and is 45 years old. The manager is Wan Zhong-jie. There are a total of five employees. Someone had previously sent warning letters one week ago, but the store did not reply. Therefore, at 7:15 PM last night, someone threw a bomb. The floor at the entrance of the store was blown away by a foot. The glass cabinet and clocks and watches and glasses in the middle were all destroyed. The glass items in the cabinets on both sides were also shattered, and glass fragments were scattered all over the ground, which was very messy. The store employees were having dinner and were far away from the counter, so they were not injured. The bomber escaped. However, according to store employees in nearby stores, at around 7:00 PM, two young men dressed in short clothes resembling workers had been lingering at the entrance of the store for a long time. Later, there was a loud bang, and the two young men disappeared into the crowd.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Sun Ke Did Not Come to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Liang Han-cao Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday on the "Fu Sheng" Ship</p>
<p>Sun Zhe-sheng, a Central Committee member staying in Hong Kong, was previously said to arrive in Shanghai on the "Grant" ship on the 28th of last month. Yesterday morning, when the ship arrived in port, Sun himself did not come to Shanghai. Only Sun's aides, Li Xian-gen and Sun Jing-ya, arrived in Shanghai on the ship. After arriving, they stayed at the East Asia Hotel. Also, Sun's secretaries, Liang Han-cao and Zhong Tian-xin, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the French postal ship "Fu Sheng". At about 2:00 PM, they landed at the China Merchants Wharf. Chen Chuang-ru and Zhou Yi-zhi and others came to the port to welcome them. According to Liang Han-cao, Member Sun had originally decided to set off for Shanghai on the 28th of last month, but because of Sun's wife's illness, he extended his medical treatment in Hong Kong, which was quite effective. Therefore, fearing that he would have to change to another doctor after arriving in Shanghai, he temporarily postponed his trip. It is not yet known exactly when he will be able to come to Shanghai. As for the situation in Guangdong, because I am in Hong Kong, I am very ignorant of everything. However, there have been no changes.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Letter from Zhu Ji-qing from the Front Line <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>A Very Large Number of Participants Along the Way</p>
<p>Telegraph Continues to Request Prompt Relief Supplies</p>
<p>Zhu Ji-qing, the commander-in-chief of the Northeast National Salvation Army, has arrived at the front line after escorting weapons and ammunition out of the pass from Tianjin last month. Now, Zhu has sent a letter to his friends in Shanghai reporting the situation outside the pass, which is recorded as follows: Dear sirs, Respectfully, Qing left Beijing for Tianjin, stayed for a few days, and arrived at a certain place on the 13th of the month. Now, I have led comrades to escort weapons and ammunition and set off out of the pass to the front line. The participants along the way are more enthusiastic than ever. Qing has separately designated concentration points and will distribute work after reaching the destination. Now everything is ready, but the number of people is increasing day by day, and ammunition and supplies will also increase day by day. The existing ammunition and supplies may be difficult to sustain. I hereby send this letter and ask you to forward it to all fathers and brothers from all walks of life at home and abroad. I wish you a pleasant summer.</p>
<h3 id="e94">No Changes to Procedures for Sending Mail to the Northeast <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The handling procedures for mail to the Northeast were previously stipulated by the Directorate General of Posts, instructing all bureaus to comply. It is now feared that mail originating from the puppet state of Manchukuo or the South Manchuria Railway zone may be sent via Dalian to avoid being penalized for underpaid postage. Therefore, stricter measures have been re-stipulated. If such circumstances are discovered, the domestic rates will be applied, and the postage will be doubled as a penalty. This was reported in various newspapers on September 1st. However, the headlines of some newspapers contained the words "[Changes to Postal Bureau's Mail Delivery Procedures for the Northeast]". Upon reviewing the content, there have been no actual changes. The Postal Bureau's supplementary strict measures are solely to prevent opportunistic exploitation by the puppet state. There has been no change to the previously established mail delivery procedures for the Northeast.</p>

<p>The Issue of Stock Reduction is Gradually Approaching Resolution</p>
<p>During the last shareholders' meeting of the Commercial Press, the issue of reducing share capital arose due to war losses in Shanghai. The views of the directors and shareholders were quite divergent, so it was decided to postpone the meeting for further discussion. Later, the Lianyi Society, organized by the shareholders, agreed on several proposals and publicly appointed Fu Zhuo, Wang Wanbai, Xu Yizhuang, and Dong Jing'an as representatives to negotiate with the directors. The chairman of the board, Zhang Jusheng, the general manager, Wang Yunwu, the manager, Xia Xiaofang, and others explained in detail the various points raised by the representatives and clarified the truth about the company. Last night, the directors hosted a banquet at the New YMCA, inviting members of the Lianyi Society of shareholders to dine together.

<h3 id="e101">Trade Associations Request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Resolve Fire Insurance Compensation in Disaster Areas <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>If No Compensation Is Paid, the Insurance Premiums Should Be Refunded</p>
<p>The fire insurance compensation issue in the disaster areas of this city has not been resolved. Various Chinese and foreign insurance companies have refused to pay compensation, citing war disasters. Although the Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Promotion Association and others have argued reasonably and organized a compensation claim group to sit and demand compensation from various insurance companies, it has been to no avail. The association even convened a general meeting of policyholders a few days ago to carry bedding and sit and demand compensation from Chinese and foreign companies, and even discussed starving to death. More than fifty trade associations of various Chinese and foreign grocery businesses in this city believe that the fire insurance compensation issue in the disaster areas has been delayed and not resolved, and the future is worrying. If the insurance companies refuse to pay compensation and do not refund the insurance premiums, then the policyholders have suffered huge losses of property and thrown the insurance premiums into nothingness. According to the principles of law and human sentiment, how can this be fair? In the future, those who insure fire insurance will be in danger, and regard insurance as a fearful thing. It is also not a good plan for the future of the various insurance companies' business. Therefore, they jointly sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting a quick resolution.</p>

<p>Telegram to Supervisory Authorities</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, based on reports received from various sources in recent days regarding the implementation of opium public sales in Jiangsu Province, and in accordance with the resolutions of the National Congress of Representatives, has launched a protest. The text of the association's telegram to the supervisory authorities is recorded as follows: Urgent. The National Government Supervisory Yuan, the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department Supervisory Committee, and all supervisory committee members, are informed that according to reliable news received from various sources, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has implemented an opium public sales system. The province has appointed Feng Zhizha as the director in charge, leasing the Fengshen Temple on the riverbank in Zhenjiang as the bureau's location, and calling it the Hubei Special Tax Bureau's Office in Jiangsu. The authorities have dispatched land and water police teams to provide protection, and four steamboats to provide transportation. The first batch of raw opium, totaling 116 boxes, has arrived and will be distributed to Suzhou, Taixing, Nantong, and other places. Fourteen opium merchants have registered, with a registration fee of 300 yuan per household. It has also been reported in the news in recent days that the Railway Bureau is responsible for transportation, and that it is also related to the public sale and transfer of opium. Although we dare not say whether this is true, rumors do not come from nowhere. Not only is this association distraught upon hearing this, but all sectors are in an uproar, resentment fills the air, and hate resonates everywhere. This association, upholding the resolutions of the recently held National Anti-Drug Representatives Congress, takes thoroughly resisting the public sale of opium as its primary goal, and rises up with determination, with no shirking of responsibility. Your Yuan/Committee are responsible for impeaching treacherous individuals and maintaining law and order. The actions of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which is adjacent to the capital, should be known. The public sale of opium is a policy that will destroy the country and exterminate the race. The situation is not small. We dare to pray that your Yuan/Committee will immediately initiate impeachment and do everything possible to stop this evil system of poisoning from spreading, and prevent the supervisory mechanism from becoming a mere formality. We would be deeply grateful. Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, respectfully. Winter Seal.</p>
<h3 id="e103">After the Ruling of the Sanyou Factory Dispute <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The long-delayed shutdown dispute of Sanyou Industrial Society has been formally adjudicated by the arbitration committee organized by the municipal government on the 31st of last month. The original text of the arbitral award has also been officially published. The attitudes of both parties are as follows:</p>
<p>▲The Labor Side Expresses Acceptance. The Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Association issued a notice to all sectors yesterday, saying: To all compatriots in the country, our workers of Sanyou Factory, under the unreasonable long-term announcement of shutdown by the factory, have no food or clothing, their livelihoods have been cut off, and they have groaned and wailed, calling for help repeatedly, even resorting to hunger strikes and cries of despair, in the hope of arousing the conscience of the capital side, and showing sympathy for the suffering of the workers over the years, and resuming work as soon as possible, in order to save them from their critical situation. However, it has ultimately failed to move their heart of stone. The Central People's Movement Committee, the Ministry of Industry of the National Government, and the party and government organs of this city, could not bear to see a national goods factory with a long-standing reputation suddenly shut down due to slight setbacks, plunging the future of industry into pessimism, and even more could not bear to see more than a thousand workers awaiting death, causing great panic in society. Therefore, the position of this party, the legacy of the Three Principles of the People, has repeatedly urged the resumption of work, but the capital side remains stubbornly unyielding, refusing to comply. The firmness of its attitude and the depth of its preconceptions are unprecedented in labor-capital disputes. Now this case was submitted to arbitration in the municipal government on the 31st of last month, and yesterday we read in the newspaper that it has been formally adjudicated. The main text of the award is still far from what this association had hoped for. The entire workforce, after the wailing of August, called for the full restoration of production, but now only one-fifth of it has been achieved. The pain of the matter cannot be overstated. However, this association, in view of the current national crisis and the eventful autumn in society, cannot bear to re-ignite other disturbances, giving the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of. This can be proved by reviewing the past facts. Now, although the arbitration decision has not satisfied the expectations of the workers, this association, in order to uphold the good faith mediation of the government, maintain the dignity of national laws, understand the difficulties of the capital side, and maintain the peace of the local public, is willing to sincerely and painfully accept it, in order to fulfill our people's obligation to obey the government, so that this long-delayed dispute can come to an end. From now on, we will also often order those workers who have resumed work to thoroughly implement the spirit of cooperation in the past, work together in harmony, step up production, and work together to promote the prosperity of the company's business and the development of domestic industry, in order to live up to the government's good intentions in this mediation and the kindness of the community in assisting, then the members of this association can also be comforted in the country. Sincerely, we ask for your public understanding. Shanghai Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Association.</p>
<p>▲Meal Expenses Not Received. This Wednesday (31st) was originally the date for the eleventh installment of meal expenses. The Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Association sent representatives Xia Zhongzhao and Gong Huanshan, accompanied by Zhu Guilin, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, to the Sanyou Society distribution office on Nanjing Road at about 11:00 AM to claim the expenses. However, they did not receive them because Wang Xianhua, the person in charge of the company, was not present. Yesterday morning, Xia Zhongzhao and Gong Huanshan were sent again, accompanied by Tan Peiyan, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, to collect them, but they still did not meet. In the afternoon, they went again, accompanied by Zhu Guilin, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau. The two representatives, Xia and Gong, waited outside, and Zhu Guilin went to the manager's office alone to negotiate. Wang Xianhua said that he had to ask Shen Jiucheng for instructions before he could issue the expenses, and asked them to come again tomorrow (i.e., today). The representative was helpless and withdrew. It is reported that the labor side owes Hongtai Rice Company money, but the company is demanding it very urgently, and it is difficult to cope with it for a while.</p>
<p>▲The Capital Side Will Have Objections. The New Voice Agency says that since the arbitration committee made the ruling, the arbitral award has been sent to the labor and capital sides. In addition to the labor side expressing reluctant agreement, the capital side believes that the arbitration decision, such as resuming a part of the work within three months, with the minimum being the capacity to accommodate one-fifth of the workers, and the remaining workers being dismissed according to the original contract, cannot be done in reality. They will clarify their objections within five days after the delivery of the arbitral award and prepare to appeal according to the law.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Major Case of Theft and Exchange of Raw Opium in the Public Security Bureau <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Director of the Stolen Goods Department Driven by Greed</p>
<p>Secretary Han Tuizhi Suspected of Involvement</p>
<p>Ten Thousand Taels of Raw Opium Have Been Secretly Shipped Out</p>
<p>Director Wen Hopes for Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Since the discovery of the major case of Zhang Shaoyi, the director of the Third Section's Stolen Goods Department of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, stealing and exchanging raw opium, people in society have generally regarded it as an unprecedented scandal since the establishment of Shanghai police affairs, and most advocate a thorough investigation to clarify the truth of the case and avoid future shame for the police force. This reporter personally visited Director Wen and probed from various sources yesterday, and found that the case is unusually complex, involving many principal and accessory offenders. The details are described separately below.</p>
<p>▲Stolen Goods Warehouse Heavily Guarded. In recent months, the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team and various district branches have cracked down on a large number of opium cases, totaling about 30,000 to 40,000 taels. When each district team cracked the cases, they all used fire lacquer to seal them firmly, and added seals and stamps, and submitted them to the Third Section for preservation in the Stolen Goods Department, pending transfer to the municipal government for supervised destruction. Therefore, the department's responsibility is extremely important, and the prevention and control are also stricter. On weekdays, only the department director or section chief and other senior personnel can enter and exit to inspect the evidence. Other personnel in the bureau are generally not allowed to enter without authorization. In addition, if there is no stolen goods to be stored, the warehouse door is sealed and locked to ensure prudence. Therefore, whenever the director changes, the seat of the director of the Stolen Goods Department cannot be easily held by anyone other than the director's confidant or someone with close family ties.</p>
<p>▲Heavy Jute Bags Are Suspicious. Since Director Wen Yingxing took office at the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Zhang Shaoyi has succeeded as the director of the Stolen Goods Department. Zhang is young and mature, and has always been valued by Director Wen. Unexpectedly, there are things in the world that are beyond expectation. On the 28th of last month, at about 11:00 AM, while the police brigade in the bureau was patrolling around the bureau, a patrolling police officer Lin suddenly caught sight of the servants of the Stolen Goods Department, Ji Asi and Wu Deyi, and the servant of the Detective Team, Xiao Mazi, and others, carrying many heavy jute bags near the stolen goods warehouse, looking flustered and sneaky. At the same time, he saw two rickshaws parked there, seemingly waiting to transport the bags.</p>
<p>▲Switching Real Opium with Fake Opium. The police officers felt strange and stepped forward to examine them carefully. They saw two of the largest bags were full of real raw opium, worth nearly 10,000 yuan. There were also seven smaller bags, with the seal of the Water Patrol Team on them. Upon closer inspection, the bags were all fake opium (commonly known as "liao zi"). The police officers interrogated them, and Ji Asi claimed that he had been ordered by Director Zhang to switch the fake opium with the real opium. The police officers further asked where the fake opium came from. They replied that a certain team in the bureau had used cars to secretly transport them to the bureau in batches to switch with the real opium.</p>
<p>▲Zhang Shaoyi Ordered to Be Detained. Upon hearing this, the police officers felt even more shocked and immediately reported to the brigade commander and detained the three servants, waiting for the director to be notified the next morning. However, the next morning, after Director Zhang Shaoyi arrived at the bureau and heard the news, he immediately bailed out the three servants. At the same time, the brigade commander and Wu Ziquan, the director of the Third Section, also reported to the director based on the information they had. At that time, Director Wen questioned Zhang in detail. While he was thoroughly investigating, Mayor Wu Tiecheng had already heard about it and was extremely angry that such a major case had occurred in the Public Security Bureau. He immediately ordered Director Wen to first detain Zhang, question him, and report the details.</p>
<p>▲Secretary Han Involved in the Case. After receiving the order, Director Wen handed Zhang over to the brigade headquarters for detention and asked the Third Section to interrogate him. Two detailed interrogations have been conducted, but because the case involves secrets, it has not been allowed to be published. However, according to reliable information from the Judicial Section, during the first preliminary hearing, Zhang's confession involved many personnel in the bureau. During the second interrogation, the confession was revised. At this time, Zhang only claimed that the mastermind behind the case was Chief Secretary Han Jin (Zi Tuizhi), and claimed that Han had secretly discussed the switching of raw opium with him several times before the incident, but he had not agreed. Finally, he said that although someone had brought seven bags of fake opium to the bureau at that time, he still suspected that it was formal stolen goods.</p>
<p>▲Director Wen Issued a Statement. Yesterday afternoon, this reporter specially visited Director Wen, who said that Secretary Han had previously held important positions in the Jinghan, Jingfeng, Jingsui, and Jinpu Railways, and had a long-standing friendship with Yu (Wen referring to himself), and had never had any out-of-line behavior, and his personality was also quite noble. He had asked for three days of leave on the 28th of last month to return to his hometown of Hangzhou to sweep the tomb, and the leave had expired yesterday, but he had not yet canceled the leave. Today, he suddenly received a telegram from him, requesting to extend the leave. Regarding this matter, he had reported to Mayor Wu this morning, and the mayor ordered Han to be wanted. He has now telegraphed the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau to assist in finding and arresting him, and bringing him to justice for strict investigation. According to the law, he should be sent to the court for handling. Before Han is arrested, he will wait for the municipal government's orders to handle the matter. Today, detectives have been dispatched to the railway station and wharves to strictly monitor his whereabouts. Finally, Yu said that he knew the contents of this case very well, and that there must be special circumstances. Moreover, Secretary Han is nearly sixty years old, and is not very familiar with the situation in Shanghai. Even if it is to buy fake opium, those who are not experienced in this way will never be able to buy it. Just from this point alone, it is impossible for Han and Zhang to handle it alone. Yu hopes that this case will be thoroughly investigated so that Yu can show his honesty to society and gain the understanding of his superiors.</p>

<p>Sheng Yishao, the young owner of Yufengxiang Silk Shop at No. 32 Shandong Road, is 27 years old and a native of Shanghai. Yesterday at 6:00 PM, while he was settling accounts in the accounting room of the shop, four kidnappers suddenly arrived. Two bandits with guns entered the room and dragged Sheng out of the accounting room without asking any questions, forcibly pulling him into a car parked outside and driving away. His family and shop assistants tried to chase after him, but it was too late. They immediately reported to the police station and sent detectives to investigate.</p>

<p>First Batch of More Than 10,000 Bags</p>
<p>Hunan has a bumper harvest this year, and the price of rice is very low. The Hunan government has opened up exports, charging a certain amount for each stone. After hearing the news, Chinese and foreign shipping companies in Shanghai competed to send steamships to Changsha to load Hunan rice to Shanghai. The China Merchants Bureau's first Jiangda ship has arrived with the first batch of more than 10,000 bags of Hunan rice, which has been imported and unloaded yesterday. The ship must be opened for loading. Sanbei Company has also sent four ships to Changsha to transport Hunan rice to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e107">New Huangpu River Navigation Markers Established by the Jianghai Customs <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Common Knowledge for Ships Navigating the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The tidal currents within the Huangpu River are very strong. In recent years, the number of merchant ships entering and leaving the port has gradually increased. In narrower sections of the river, merchant ships often collide and sink while turning around. This is often caused by sampans, barges, and small boats traversing the river without knowing how to avoid larger vessels, leading to capsizing accidents. News of drownings is heard almost daily. To maintain the safety of the Huangpu River, Mr. Gu Lien, Acting Director of the Port Authority, has specially revised various markers and issued a public notice to merchant ships in the port, instructing them on how to navigate and avoid accidents such as capsizing and falling into the water. New regulations have also been established regarding daytime and nighttime warning signs for dredgers and pump boats in the river, which are now being communicated to all ships, large and small, for compliance. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>▲ Warning Markers for Dredgers: There are many dredgers in the Huangpu River, dredging the riverbed and moored in various locations. The current regulations stipulate the flags, lights, and mooring symbols to be displayed: (1) A red flag and a solid black oblique square shape should be displayed to indicate that the dredger is moored in the middle of the Huangpu River. (2) A black sphere should be displayed to indicate that the dredger is moored closer to the Pudong side of the river. (3) Two black spheres should be displayed to indicate that the dredger is moored closer to the Shanghai side of the river. At night, warning signals should consist of a white light at both the bow and stern of the ship. (1) At night, three red lights arranged in a triangle, with one at the top and two at the bottom, should be displayed to indicate mooring in the middle of the Huangpu River. (2) Three red lights in a triangle, with a white light at the top and a red light at each end of the base line, should be displayed to indicate mooring closer to Pudong. (3) Three red lights in a triangle, with a red light at the apex and a white light at each end of the base line, should be displayed to indicate mooring closer to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Warning Markers for Pump Boats: The warning markers for pump boats also stipulate that a red flag should be displayed during the day to indicate that the boat is connected to the riverbank with a hose. At night, three white lights should be displayed in a triangle, with the apex pointing upwards, to indicate that the boat is connected to the riverbank with a hose. All of the above-mentioned dredgers and pump boats must display these newly revised warning flags and lights when obstructing navigation in the Huangpu River. The lights used are quite powerful and can be seen from up to a mile away in clear weather. Yesterday, the Jianghai Customs Port Authority notified all shipping companies to distribute these new regulations regarding navigation markers in the Huangpu River to their ship personnel so that they can navigate the river with a clear basis and reduce unfortunate accidents.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Silk Loan for Sichuan to be Issued <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Amount Set at 2.5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Li Kui'an Traveled to Beijing Last Night for Negotiations</p>
<p>The failure of China's silk trade in recent years has placed silk merchants across the country on the verge of bankruptcy. Sichuan, as a silk-producing region of China, has suffered from the exclusion of foreign silk for years, as well as domestic competition from rayon, leading to a situation of near collapse. Mr. Li Kui'an, Chairman of the Sichuan Chongqing General Chamber of Commerce and the Silk Trade Association, came south to negotiate with the Ministry of Finance regarding the issuance of silk loans for Sichuan. He took the overnight express train to Beijing last night. Before leaving, he told reporters that Sichuan silk merchants had previously requested the Ministry of Finance to issue 2.5 million yuan in relief silk loans, which had been approved. As he was about to leave Shanghai, he was going to Beijing to negotiate the issuance procedures with the Ministry of Finance, and would return to Shanghai in two days. Mr. Li, who is a standing committee member of the Anti-Civil War League, attended the second standing committee meeting on the 6th of this month and left Shanghai for Chongqing the next day.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Shanghai Stamp Tax Bureau Streamlines Tax Collection <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Xu Zhicheng, Director of the Shanghai Stamp Tax Bureau, issued a proclamation yesterday, stating: "This is a proclamation regarding stamp tax, which is a good tax universally practiced worldwide and a legitimate source of national revenue. The original intent of implementing stamp tax was to have very low tax rates with broad application. All personnel certificates, once stamped in accordance with regulations, are recognized as legal evidence. Therefore, merchants and the public fulfill their obligation to pay national taxes and enjoy the right to protection under the law. If this can be understood by every household and universally applied, the burden on the people will be small, and the public revenue will gradually increase. This is beneficial to both the national economy and the people's livelihood. Shanghai is located in the central business district, where personnel matters are frequent and public awareness is high, surpassing other regions. In recent years, the sales volume of tax stamps has gradually increased. However, due to the vastness of the jurisdiction and the crisscrossing waterways, while the majority adhere to the regulations and diligently comply, there are still many instances of intentional evasion and disregard for the law. The Director of this Bureau is now under orders from the provincial bureau to urge stricter supervision and assessment. It is our duty to rectify tax collection. In addition to instructing sales personnel to comply and dispatching personnel for inspection at any time, we hereby issue this proclamation to all merchants and people transporting goods by land and water within our jurisdiction. All account books, receipts, permits, and licenses that require stamp duty must be handled in accordance with regulations and must not be evaded. In recent years, shops of various kinds often attempt to avoid stamp duty by not issuing invoices and using a type of informal note or slip that only lists the prices of goods without the year or the shop's stamp. Such cases have been discovered from time to time. This type of disguised invoice clearly constitutes illegal tax evasion, which greatly harms tax revenue. The Ministry of Finance previously issued a proclamation strictly prohibiting this practice. All shops selling goods worth one yuan or more must issue invoices and affix stamps in accordance with regulations. The use of disguised notes or delivery slips as substitutes, or the failure to affix stamps, is prohibited. Violators will be punished in accordance with the penalty provisions without leniency. This has been posted and announced in the past. We now urge all merchants to thoroughly eliminate all forms of tax evasion. For any goods worth one yuan or more, an invoice must be issued and stamped accordingly. Other documents such as receipts and settlement statements must not be replaced by letters or notices to avoid stamp duty. It should be understood that whether a business document violates regulations depends on its nature, not its form. Investigations and crackdowns will be based on documented evidence and will not allow for pretense. The Director of this Bureau understands the difficulties faced by merchants and is committed to balancing legal requirements with public concerns. We do not want anyone in our jurisdiction to mistakenly violate the penalty provisions due to opportunism. Therefore, we do not hesitate to provide prior warning. If the above-mentioned situations still occur in the future, once discovered or reported, we will only handle them in accordance with the law. Do not say that you were not warned in advance. Everyone must comply and not violate this proclamation."</p>

<p>Totaling 10,000 Yuan in Two Remittances</p>
<p>Regarding relief funds for refugees from Outer Mongolia, Mr. Wang Yiting of the Shanghai charitable organizations had already raised 10,000 yuan, and previously remitted 5,000 yuan to Mr. Xiong Bing'san of the Red Swastika Society in Beiping, requesting him to transfer it to Representative Li Fenggang for distribution on the ground. The remaining funds were to be remitted within three days. It is now heard that these relief funds have been remitted. The original telegram from Mr. Wang Yiting to Mr. Xiong Bing'san is reproduced below: "To Mr. Xiong Bing'san of the Red Swastika Society on Shifuma Street, Beiping, with deepest respect: Your telegram has been received. The relief funds for Outer Mongolian refugees were delivered today to the Bank of China for remittance, totaling 5,000 yuan. Please transfer it to Representative Li Fenggang for distribution on the ground, and please have your organization send personnel to assist. As the funds were remitted several days ago without any response, I am deeply concerned. I am writing again today to have another 5,000 yuan remitted through the Bank of China, and request that you follow the instructions in the previous telegram. The total amount remitted in two installments is 10,000 yuan. Please telegraph a confirmation when the funds are received, for which I will be eternally grateful. Your younger brother, Wang Zhen, kowtows, Winter Seal."</p>

<h3 id="e112">No Results from Shanghai Social Bureau's Inquiry into Xu Chongdao Labor Dispute Yesterday <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Workers Propose Six New Conditions</p>
<p>Over two hundred workers from ten branches of the Shanghai Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Store went on strike in support of their colleague Zheng Pei, who was allegedly falsely accused. The Shanghai Social Bureau convened an inquiry yesterday, but no results were achieved. The workers put forward six new conditions, while the management petitioned Party and government authorities. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Inquiry Results: Regarding the strike by all employees of Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine headquarters and branches, the Municipal Social Bureau convened representatives from both labor and management at the Bureau at 10:00 AM yesterday for an inquiry. Those present included Zhang Meian, representative of the Chinese Medicine Trade Association; Fang Qingjian and Yuan Pinzhang, representatives of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union; Cen Zhiliang, representative of Xu Chongdao's management; and Cen Yongkang and Sun Zhenkui, representatives of the labor side. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Wang, representative of the Social Bureau. First, representatives from both labor and management presented the details of the case. The Chairman then summarized the opinions of all parties and decided on two measures: (1) The report by Zheng Peiran, an employee of the seventh branch of the store, alleging that Qu Ming, the manager of the first branch, had falsely accused him of theft, involved personal disputes and fell within the scope of the judiciary, and should be resolved separately by Zheng and Qu through legal means. (2) The strike by the store's employees was sudden, and was not approved by Party and government authorities or permitted by the relevant higher-level union, and was therefore illegal. Therefore, all employees were advised to resume work as soon as possible. However, the labor side insisted on the dismissal of Qu Ming and refused to accept the previous measures, leading to a fruitless conclusion and dispersal.</p>
<p>▲ New Demands: At 2:00 PM yesterday, all employees of Xu Chongdao headquarters and branches held an emergency meeting. Cen Yongkang, the representative who attended the Social Bureau meeting, reported on the situation of the inquiry and proposed that the store be required to accept six new conditions: (1) Equal treatment for all employees within Xu Chongdao. (2) A uniform monthly wage increase of three yuan for all employees in all branches. (3) Apprentices who perform work should be treated as employees and should not work night shifts during their apprenticeship. (4) A uniform monthly wage of sixteen yuan for veteran employees. (5) Student subsidies: one yuan per month in the first year, two yuan per month in the second year, and three yuan per month in the third year. Bonuses: five yuan in the first year, ten yuan in the second year, and fifteen yuan in the third year. The minimum cost for meals should be 24 cents per table. (6) Restoration of the original holiday schedule: ten days for the Dragon Boat Festival, ten days for the Mid-Autumn Festival, and twenty days for the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>▲ Management Petitions: At 3:00 PM yesterday, the store's manager Cen Zhiliang, accompanied by Zhang Meian, representative of the Chinese Medicine Trade Association, went to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau to request a solution. Xu Yefu, Chief of the Third Section of the Social Bureau, received the representatives and stated that the Party and government authorities had decided on measures for handling the case after consultation and would implement them in the coming days. He asked the management to remain calm and await a legal resolution from the Bureau and the Party Headquarters. Subsequently, they went to the Municipal Party Headquarters, where they were received by Zhu Yangwu, Secretary of the Civil Training Section, who gave a similar response to that of the Social Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e113">After the Suspension of the Shanghai South Public Bus Service <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Workers Convened a General Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Solutions</p>
<p>Petition to Party and Government Authorities Scheduled for Today</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the suspension of operations by the Shanghai South Public Bus Company on Xie Xu Road, the company's outstanding wages, which the Party and government had already decided to pay, have been the subject of a dispute due to the company's insistence that workers return their uniforms, badges, and leave the factory. As a result, the outstanding wages have not yet been paid. The workers believe that the management lacks sincerity. In addition to seeking assistance from various sectors, they have decided that all workers will petition Party and government authorities this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Outstanding Wages Unpaid: The issue of the company's outstanding wages had already been decided by the Party and government authorities, with both labor and management required to send representatives to verify the wage accounts before payment. However, other demands were to be dealt with separately. The management insisted that the workers agree to return their uniforms, badges, and leave the factory before the outstanding wages could be paid. The workers were willing to accept the issue of leaving the factory, but unanimously refused to return their uniforms and badges, as they were crucial for their livelihood. The company's outstanding wages have not yet been paid, and the dispute between the two sides is intensifying, raising concerns about the escalation of labor unrest.</p>
<p>▲ Workers' General Meeting: All the workers, noting that the directors and managers in charge of the company had been avoiding meetings and that only the liquidator, accountant Jiang Wanping, had been appearing to handle matters, deeply felt that there would be many obstacles to receiving the outstanding wages and that it would be even more difficult to realize their demands. Therefore, they had no choice but to plan for countermeasures. They convened a general meeting of all workers at 2:00 PM yesterday, and decided on the following: (1) Oppose the company's demand to return uniforms and badges. (2) All workers petition Party and government authorities, demanding that the company be ordered to resume operations. (3) The company should continue to pay wages during the suspension of operations. (4) If the company deliberately prolongs the situation and is unwilling to provide for the workers' livelihoods, they will fight with all their might to the death. (5) Appeal to all sectors to provide impartial assistance.</p>
<p>▲ Party and Government Mediation: Since the company announced the suspension of operations on August 30th, the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau, after receiving reports from both labor and management, dispatched Fan Guoren and Peng Zhenqiu to investigate both sides and attempt to mediate. However, the workers demanded that outstanding wages be paid first, while the management insisted that the workers return their uniforms, badges, and leave the factory. Although these officials have been working hard to mediate for days and have drafted solutions, the situation has taken a turn for the worse, as both labor and management are taking extreme positions, making it even more difficult to resolve. According to Fan Guoren, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, they have drafted a solution and are proceeding step by step to resolve the labor unrest as soon as possible.</p>
<p>▲ Petition Today: All the workers, facing a precarious livelihood due to the suspension of operations and the non-payment of outstanding wages, and feeling that the company has no sincere intention to resolve the matter, decided at a general meeting to organize a team petition to Party and government authorities this morning, demanding that the company be ordered to resume operations.</p>

<p>Union Requests Protection from Party and Government Authorities</p>
<p>Most of the brewing workshops in this city are located in the Pudong area, with a total of approximately 500 workers. These workshops have generally prospered over the years. Since the establishment of the brewing industry union, a labor-management contract has been signed with the employers. Recently, the terms of the contract have been under revision, and the Municipal Party Headquarters, together with the Social Bureau, will convene both parties today to discuss all matters. However, three workshops, including Wan Yuan Fu Ji and Xin Ji, dismissed over twenty workers, including Yu Yongqiao. Upon hearing the news, all the workers were outraged, believing that the employers were taking advantage of the revision of the contract to dismiss a large number of workers without cause, with the intention of suppressing and undermining the labor movement. They convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures and submitted a request to Party and government authorities yesterday for protection.</p>

<p>Conditions for Preferential Treatment of Workers Must Be Discussed Item by Item</p>
<p>Regarding the labor unrest at the British American Tobacco Company's Pudong factory, where all workers opposed the factory's management rules, the Social Bureau has convened several inquiries for mediation, but without results. The Social Bureau convened another inquiry the day before yesterday and immediately decided on two principles: (1) Both the union and the factory must abide by the current labor law. (2) If the factory traditionally provides workers with benefits superior to those stipulated in the current law, those benefits should be maintained. After these two decisions were made, the management representatives agreed to consider them at the time and responded yesterday. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the management again sent representatives Yang Deke and Chen Yunxiang to the Bureau to respond. They were received by Wang Gang, the original case officer, and stated that the previous preferential treatment conditions must be discussed item by item and could not be fully accepted. It is now heard that the Social Bureau has scheduled another date for formal mediation.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Situation of Fire Insurance Claim Group Yesterday <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Temporarily Stopped from Departing</p>
<p>According to the Riri News, policyholders of the Disaster Area Fire Insurance Claim Assistance Association previously organized a fire insurance claim group and requested compensation for losses from various insurance companies, but without results. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, over fifty households from the group went to the Fire Insurance Claim Assistance Association at No. 1 Liu Ma Road and elected Jin Weisan and Ma Rugen as representatives to lead a team to the Xiangzhen Insurance Company on Beijing Road to request compensation for fire insurance losses. The company sent a Western comprador, Leske, to receive them. The representatives stated their intentions and requested prompt compensation for losses based on the principles of fire insurance. They were told that the company was a managerial office and would forward the request to the head office, Sanyi Insurance Company, for review and response. Later, they went to the Wilili Insurance Company on Sichuan Road to request compensation according to precedent. However, as both the Chinese and foreign compradores of the company were out, no one received them. They then withdrew and will seek compensation again at a later date.</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Municipal Council, concerned that the Fire Insurance Claim Assistance Association's organization of policyholders into claim groups to seek compensation from various insurance companies would lead to prolonged disputes and increasing conflicts, which would negatively impact public order, sent Inspector-General Dus to the Association yesterday to advise them to stop organizing teams to seek compensation for now in order to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts. The Municipal Council would attempt to mediate between the parties. It is now known that the Association has notified its policyholders to temporarily suspend organizing teams to seek compensation and await mediation. It is said that the Association plans to convene a general meeting of all fire insurance policyholders next Wednesday (the 7th) to discuss all measures.</p>

<p>The Great American Evening Post reported that the International Telegraph Union is scheduled to hold a meeting in Madrid, the capital of Spain, on September 10 of this year. It is reported that the meeting will discuss the issue of coded telegrams and may change existing regulations and increase the cost of submarine telegraph cables to Shanghai. Upon receiving this news, the American Chamber of Commerce in this city believes that this measure would harm business and is especially inappropriate at a time when the market is depressed and business is sluggish. Yesterday, it protested to the local wireless and submarine telegraph companies, requesting that they convey to their head offices not to increase telegraph rates for Shanghai at the Madrid meeting in order to add to the difficulties faced by foreign merchants in Shanghai.</p>

Chen Shaofu, Director of the Industrial Department Exhibition Hall, attended. Because Mr. Chen and his wife Youdi had gone to Hangzhou to collect domestic goods and had not yet returned, they sent Zhou Wenwei, Chief of the General Affairs Section, as their representative. Chen Yiting, Hu Xiyuan, Shen Mengshi, Xian Guansheng, Sun Xueni, Chen Binghui, Wang Honghui, Xu Genghua, Yi Zhiyun, Zhu Gengtao, Tang Qiongxiang, Wang Hanqiang, Sun Daosheng, Yu Baosan, Yang Yucheng, Zhang Qingfa, Dong Boying, Lin Guyun, Wang Zhaolin, and thirty-six others were also in attendance.

Now, Mr. Yu Binqi, the inventor of the Chinese typewriter patented by the National Government, has succeeded through careful research due to the needs of his own machines and other typewriters. The type is suitable for all kinds of Chinese typewriters and remains unchanged after repeated use, truly a weapon of culture. In order to facilitate procurement from all sectors, a distribution office has been specially set up at the China Industrial Company, No. 9 Hankou Road, Shanghai.

<h3 id="e125">Zhengda Bank Sues Huang Zhiqing et al. for Fraud <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Court Orders Out-of-Court Reconciliation</p>
<p>Saying Litigation Leads to Ruin</p>
<p>Zhengda Bank on Jiangxi Road recently commissioned lawyer Wu Guochang to file a complaint with the First Special Court of the Special District, accusing Huang Zhiqing, resident at No. 41 Xianmianci Road in Shanghai city, and Zou Jiabai, resident at No. 35 Gu Yuan Road in the French Concession, of the crime of fraudulently obtaining property by forging documents. The reasons for the prosecution are that Huang, in January of the 19th year, claimed that the Chongming Electric Power Co., Ltd., of which he was the chairman, was his own electric power plant. With Zou as guarantor, he borrowed 30,000 taels of standard silver. He drew up a mortgage loan agreement and a list of property, with items such as the factory building land license and insurance policy attached, with a promise to submit supplements later. He repeatedly delayed without submitting them, and failed to pay interest installments. Upon urging the guarantor, he said he would find a way to transfer the Chongming Electric Power Plant to settle the debt. Unexpectedly, there was no news afterwards. The court was forced to transfer the case to the Chongming County Government for prosecution. When shareholders of Chongming Electric Power Co., Ltd., such as Shi Yuming, came forward to file a principal intervention lawsuit, Huang admitted in court that it was a joint-stock company and that he had written "self-owned" because it was difficult to explain the debt at the time. Zou also hid and did not appear. In May of this year, the Chongming County Government ruled that the mortgage contract signed between Zhengda Bank and Huang Zhiqing, regarding all the property of Chongming Electric Power Co., Ltd., was invalid as collateral. Therefore, the defendants' behavior constituted two crimes under Articles 224 and 363 of the Criminal Law. This case was heard by Judge Fu Lin. Because the defendant claimed that Zhengda Bank was a legal entity, the chairman of the bank should come forward as the plaintiff so that he could bear the responsibility of the criminal lawsuit. If the complaint was inaccurate, a false accusation could be filed. Therefore, a responsible person had to sign his name. The plaintiff immediately added Wang Wenzhi, chairman of Zhengda Bank, and Zou Jiabai as the representative. The defendant argued that Zou was not the chairman, and according to the law, the chairman himself should be present in court. This point was still the focus of debate between the two sides at yesterday's hearing. Judge Pu advised Huang Zhiqing that the money he owed must eventually be repaid, and it would be better to reconcile out of court. Litigation leads to ruin. If reconciliation was not possible, Wang Wenzhi must be brought to court, and the hearing was adjourned to next Friday.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Wu Runsheng's Appeal to Confirm Identity in Inheritance Dispute Rejected <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>There was a Wu Meisheng, who had some property. He lived at No. 96 Xinzha Road. He married Lian, his first wife, who died early and left a son named Guoliang. His second wife, Bao, had no children. In April of this year, Wu died of illness. At that time, Guoliang attended to the funeral arrangements. Later, on May 21, Wu Runsheng, a distant nephew of Meisheng's clan (currently the Chinese manager of He Kang Foreign Firm on Beijing Road, i.e., the only son of Wu from the same township), sent a letter through lawyers Jiang Yiping and Zou Shengzu to Wu Bao, saying that Guoliang was not Meisheng's biological son but an adopted son. He claimed to be Meisheng's adopted son and opposed Guoliang's identity, severely questioning him and demanding the handover of property. As a result, Wu Bao hired lawyers Li Zuyu and Chen Ying to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the First Special Court against Wu Runsheng, requesting a judgment confirming that the defendant was not the adopted son of her late husband Wu Meisheng. The reason given was that Wu Runsheng was a distant nephew of Meisheng's clan and lived separately, having no connection with the plaintiff's family. During Wu Meisheng's mourning period, he sent elegiac couplets and tin foil paper items in the capacity of a clan nephew. The couplets even marked the relationship as uncle and nephew. Runsheng took the couplets away on the afternoon of May 19 under a pretext, which was removed by the doorman Xu Cheng, which could be proven. The defense of the defendant Wu Runsheng stated that Meisheng had no descendants, only an adopted son Guoliang. In the intercalary June of the 19th year, Guoliang had a daughter who celebrated her full month at the Yipinxiang Hotel. Wu Meisheng convened a meeting of relatives and decided that the defendant would inherit as a collateral heir, to continue the bloodline of the family. The relative Wu Xu could testify to this. However, the plaintiff did not notify the defendant of the mourning. He completely denied the plaintiff's claim of taking back the elegiac couplets and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected. The presiding judge Lou Ying ruled that Wu Runsheng was not the adopted son of the plaintiff's late husband Wu Meisheng. The litigation costs were to be borne by the defendant. Wu Runsheng refused to accept the judgment and hired the same three lawyers, Jiang Yiping, to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Wu Bao also filed a defense, requesting that the original judgment be upheld and the appeal be rejected. The Second Branch of the High Court concluded the hearing and, at 3:00 PM yesterday, the Chief Judge of the Civil Division, Hu Yigu, convened a collegial panel to announce the judgment. The main text stated: The appeal is dismissed, and the litigation costs of the second instance are to be borne by the appellant.</p>

<p>Wang Chonghao, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, arrested Xu Jia Kui, an Anhui native, at No. 56 Taopeng Road at 1:10 AM on the 19th of last month. He also confiscated a pistol and four bullets. Subsequently, he apprehended three other fellow villagers, Wu Yeming, Zhu Yeyu, and Yuan Peicai, in a teahouse near the Pingliang Road vegetable market. They were all sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong continued the hearing in the Fourth Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated that the second defendant, Wu Yeming, had previously committed a kidnapping case in the Tianran River area of Zhujing, Deqing County, Zhejiang. The local water police had arrested three suspects, and Wu was one of them. He later escaped to Shanghai. However, the firearms and ammunition were handed over to Xu Jia Kui with the intention of committing robbery in Shanghai again, hoping that his accomplices could share the ransom after it was paid. The police station is prosecuting the four defendants under the Military Firearms Control Regulations and requested the court to handle the case according to the law. Today, Gu Liancheng, an investigator from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, arrived and requested a transfer. The police station did not object but required a formal announcement. According to Detective Gu's statement, the Deqing County Government in Zhejiang had sent a letter of notification. When questioned, Yu Jia Kui confessed that the pistol was indeed brought by Wu Yeming and given to him, but he knew nothing about Wu's kidnapping case in the interior. Wu Yeming denied participating in the kidnapping case in the interior. He admitted that he brought the pistol to Shanghai and gave it to Xu Jia Kui, but he did not intend to commit illegal activities in Shanghai. Zhu Yeyu and Yuan Peicai stated that they had just met Wu and knew nothing else. Judge Shen concluded the debate on the case and scheduled a pronouncement. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Accomplice Liu Xigen Arrested</p>
<p>Zhou Dianchen, a 36-year-old native of Xuzhou, lived at No. 39 Xinshunli, Yangshupu Road. At about 10:00 AM on the 31st of last month, he went to the Jixing Bicycle Shop at No. 8 on the same road to rent a bicycle and had a disagreement with the shop's apprentice, slapping the apprentice in the face. At 8:20 PM that evening, the shop owner, Ji Youdao, gathered several people and went to the vicinity of Xinshunli to reason with Zhou. They disagreed and started fighting. As a result, Zhou was stabbed in the leg and fell to the ground. A patrolling police officer arrived and arrested the people involved in the fight, who all fled. The injured Zhou was taken to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment but died of his injuries at 6:00 AM the next morning. The body was sent to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road for examination. Subsequently, the police arrested Liu Xigen, an accomplice from Wuxi, and detained him at the Yangshupu Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated the case. Ms. Zhu Xu, a woman from Ningbo, testified that the deceased was her foster father and that she had witnessed the defendant's complicity at the scene. Zhu Cailin stated that he heard a fight and went to mediate but was pushed into the river. When he got up, Zhou Dianchen had already been beaten and injured and was being sent to the hospital. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he also went to mediate and did not beat Zhou, which the employees of the Zhengmao Clothing Store and Liu Mao's Bicycle Shop nearby could testify to. He asked for verification. Judge Shen Bingrong adjourned the hearing to re-examine the evidence. At about 10:00 AM, a prosecutor from the court went to the site and examined Zhou Dianchen's body, ordering the family to claim the body for coffining and burial. Liu Xigen was returned to the police station for custody.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Continental Daily's Reactionary Opinions <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Printer Suffers as a Result</p>
<p>Tang Bao, an inspector from the Public Security Bureau, was ordered on the morning of the 23rd of last month to forward a notice to the Old Gate Police Station to dispatch detectives to assist in searching No. 352 Fusenli, Beihai Road, for printing reactionary newspapers. At that time, the printing house was printing the Continental Daily. The staff members Qian Jingao and Yang Enpei were arrested. The next day, the police station applied to the Second Branch of the High Court for their detention. Yesterday was the date for the trial of this case. Tang Bao, an inspector from the Public Security Bureau, stated that the Public Security Bureau had received a telegram from the Central Government and Chairman Liu of Henan, stating that Wang Aoxi was running the Continental Daily in Shanghai and that its opinions were close to being reactionary. He was asked to arrest him. So, at 3:00 AM on the 23rd, he went to the China Commercial Printing Company, which was printing the newspaper, to search and arrest. Thirty copies of the Continental Daily had already been printed, and the two staff members Qian Jingao and Yang Enpei were arrested. At the same time, 7,000 copies of the old Continental Daily were found in No. 180 Funingli, Zhejiang Road. He requested to be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Qian Jingao stated that the printing of the Continental Daily was introduced by the Dajing Newspaper House and the Dajing Printing House. The printing contract was witnessed by the famous lawyers Li and Liu, and the legal advisors of the Continental Daily were also Li and Liu. Moreover, the distribution of the newspaper was public. He really did not know it was reactionary. The contract for printing this newspaper could prove that he did not know the situation. The police station's lawyer stated that Qian and Gao were not principal offenders, and the crime of printing reactionary newspapers occurred in the Public Concession. Therefore, the police station opposed the transfer and believed that the Second Branch of the High Court should try the case. Since the defendant claimed that there was a contract to prove his innocence, he should be ordered to produce the contract for review. The Presiding Judge Yu Ye ordered the 7,000 copies of the newspaper found on Zhejiang Road to be taken away by the Public Security Bureau and ordered Qian Jingao to go home to retrieve the contract and submit it to the court for further review.</p>

<p>▲Postal Workers' Union: The third joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees was held on August 31. Chairman Lu Keming presided over the meeting. The following matters were reported and discussed: (1) The First Special Group suggested: 1. Pension payments should be divided into three periods: 10 years, 15 years, and 25 years. 2. Postal workers in Shanghai should be given special housing subsidies. 3. Modify the long-term leave regulations and attach a letter of justification for each of these suggestions. Is this feasible for discussion? (Resolution) Regarding items 1 and 3, the National Postal Workers' Union has already made a resolution in the Second Congress and should be submitted to the General Union for joint handling. As for item 2, the Northeast issue is currently occurring, and the postal economy has suffered greatly. The request should be discussed later. (2) The Thirty-fourth Branch submitted a request for 20 yuan in subsidies to organize a football team and a loan of 100 yuan, to be repaid in ten months. Should this be approved for discussion?

<p>To the esteemed editor,</p>
<p>We have reviewed the news article published in your newspaper yesterday entitled [Shanghai South Public Bus Company Pays Back Wages After Shutdown]. There is no such provision in item 3 of the alternative solutions [Workers leave the factory after receiving payment]. The party and government agencies convened both parties on the day before yesterday (September 1) to resolve the issue of wage arrears independently. Although the capital side proposed returning the uniforms and badges at that time, the workers immediately declared that if the company reclaimed the uniforms, badges, and workers leaving the factory, all other conditions must be resolved before that could happen. In the stalemate, Peng Zhenqiu of the Social Affairs Bureau ordered that the back wages be paid first, and other issues be mediated in another case. Therefore, the statement that workers left the factory after receiving payment is completely inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, we request that it be corrected as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai South Public Bus Workers' Union</p>
<p>September 2</p>

<h3 id="e145">Luo Jialun, President of National Central University, Scheduled to Take Office Today <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Submitted to the Executive Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>Detailed Presentation of Opinions on Reorganizing and Developing National Central University</p>
<p>And Statement of Term of Office Limited to One Year</p>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd - Luo Jialun is scheduled to take over as President of National Central University on the 3rd. The qualifying examination will be implemented as scheduled.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd - Luo Jialun, the newly appointed President of National Central University, recently yielded to the exhortations of various parties, unable to bear to see National Central University stagnate for so long, leading to an unmanageable situation. Therefore, he upheld the spirit of accepting a mission in times of crisis and agreed to do his best to maintain it. Yesterday, he submitted a detailed report to the Executive Yuan, presenting his opinions on reorganizing and developing National Central University, requesting guidance on policies, and declaring that his term of office would be limited to a maximum of one academic year. The text of his submission is as follows:</p>
<p>Submitting a request for guidance on policies and declaration of term of office: If one does not worry about accepting the order of President of National Central University, one is either foolish or reckless. To see scholars who cherish their reputation shy away from the highest institution of national education is heartbreaking. Although Jialun is incompetent, does he not know how to cherish his reputation? It is only because various parties have held him responsible with righteousness, on the one hand, he cannot bear to see National Central University stagnate for so long, which will lead to an unmanageable situation, and on the other hand, considering the difficulties faced by the government and the future of the national cultural undertaking, he cannot bear to ignore the difficulties and dangers during the national crisis. Therefore, he does not hesitate to contribute his meager abilities, regardless of success or failure, and takes the spirit of accepting a mission in times of crisis to go. Moreover, the education undertaking is not absolutely impossible to do, and personal sacrifice is not something to be cherished. It depends on whether there is an educational ideal as a goal and whether there are steps to achieve this goal as a price for sacrifice. Jialun believes that managing National Central University should take forming an organic national culture as the ideal, so that the national university and the nation's survival have a close and unbreakable relationship. In the current national crisis, National Central University should especially bear the responsibility that the University of Berlin bore for Germany in the early and mid-19th century. With this advocacy, it becomes the academic style of the whole country. However, after the twists and turns of National Central University, if one wants to achieve this ideal, there must be practical steps. These steps can be divided into three periods. The first period is the stabilization period, which must be stable before it can be developed, and it must cultivate a spirit of academic research before it can be developed. Seek progress in stability. The second period is the enrichment period, striving for the concentration of talents and the increase of equipment. The third period is the development period, carrying out large-scale construction according to the planned plan to make it a modern university. Except that the first and second periods can be assumed to be combined into one year, the third period can last indefinitely. However, there must be the first period before the second period can be mentioned, and the second period must be passed before the third period can be reached. Otherwise, National Central University and a part of the nation's vitality will inevitably perish together in the midst of turmoil. If one wants to put National Central University on the right track, there are many factors, and the understanding of objective facts and the future of the nation by all parties is particularly important. Jialun hopes that the Executive Yuan will pay attention to three points in particular. First, the funds should be continued to be effectively maintained and guaranteed, and the full amount should be paid monthly according to the budget. Second, for the President of the University, please follow the established rules and give him special responsibility and deep trust. If there are any changes that should be made to the University Organization Law, please consider changing them during the reorganization period. At this time when we are striving for stability, we also hope to have the determination to help him solve difficult problems. Third, if there is a construction plan, please do your best to urge its implementation. If approved, Jialun is willing to sacrifice for an educational ideal. Success is the success of the national education undertaking, and failure is failure for martyrdom of his advocacy. Otherwise, he would not dare to increase his sins with his incompetent body. Moreover, Jialun has a request to make. Although Jialun has set three stages for the planning of National Central University, Jialun himself only dares to try to run it in the first stage. Please give him half a year first. If there is a factual necessity, then continue for another half year at most, to make it one academic year. When the time comes, he will resign resolutely, and must first search for virtuous and capable people to take over. However, within this period, Jialun will never have the intention of being a temporary official. He will hold on to public loyalty and courage, in addition to striving for reform, and he will also set a long-term plan for National Central University to promote its future development. If it is beneficial to the country, success does not have to be self-serving. Moreover, it is not convenient to take care of the Central Political School for a long time. For the sake of morality, Jialun cannot leave the political school for other places. If this stabilization period cannot be achieved or if funds cannot be supported, then any continued sacrifice by Jialun will be useless. He should immediately return what was entrusted to him by the Executive Yuan to the Executive Yuan, and ask it to make plans immediately to avoid leaving behind mistakes. His sincere words are respectfully presented, and he begs for guidance. He is extremely anxious. In addition to submitting a copy to the Ministry of Education, he respectfully presents it to the President of the Executive Yuan.</p>

The number of those who have submitted applications for registration is 24 middle schools and 112 elementary schools. In addition, there are still 7 middle schools and 61 elementary schools that have not complied with the regulations on private schools to apply for registration. The bureau has compiled a list and sent letters to the Public Security Bureau, the Special Zone Court, and the patrol station to strictly ban them.</p>
<p>▲Schools That Have Not Been Approved for Establishment May Not Enroll Students: The bureau recently published a notice in the newspaper stating that if a private individual or private legal person wants to establish a middle or elementary school in the city, they should comply with the regulations on private schools and apply for approval in order before they can open and start enrolling students. New specialized schools above the junior college level should be submitted to the bureau in order for review and transfer to the Ministry of Education for approval. Otherwise, they will be immediately banned, and the bureau has sent letters to major newspapers to refuse to publish enrollment advertisements.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Shanghai Municipal Council Allocates Subsidies to Private Schools <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>In order to promote education, the Shanghai Municipal Council has specially designated funds in the budget to subsidize appropriate private middle and elementary schools in the concession. Due to certain reasons, the payment of this subsidy to Chinese private schools was suspended last year. This year, with the assistance of the Municipal Education Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Council reviewed the applications of various schools for subsidies and selected a Chinese committee within the bureau to formulate implementation methods and review the subsidies and the amounts to be given. Subsequently, it was decided to grant subsidies to a total of 57 schools, divided into four categories: nine schools in category A, sixteen schools in category B, fifteen schools in category C, and seventeen schools in category D. The total annual subsidy is 82,500 taels of silver, the highest of which is 14,000 taels for the YMCA Middle School, and the lowest is 150 taels for certain elementary schools. Now, the amount for the first half of the year is being issued first, totaling 41,250 taels. This case has been approved for implementation by the board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council at its meeting this Wednesday. However, before the next payment, the Shanghai Municipal Council may still review it again. The schools that receive this subsidy should use it to improve the school's facilities, and the sanitation facilities should be handled first to emphasize hygiene. The sanitation conditions of each school are also inspected by personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department to facilitate improvement. The financial reports submitted by each school have also been deemed satisfactory by the Shanghai Municipal Council Finance Department. As for the private schools of various foreign nationals, the subsidy for the first half of this year has also been allocated, and the distribution method is roughly the same as last year.</p>

<p>The Chinese Cultural College was planned to be established by Wang Shengshan, chairman of the board of directors of Guanghua University, Professor Zhang Shoujian, Li Xuchuan, Hu Pu'an, Feng Bingnan, Wu Zhongwen, etc. The preparatory office was established at 55 Huayuanfang, Jinshenfu Road, and has been in existence for more than a year. In addition to surveying 118 mu of land for the campus on Meiren Peak in Hangzhou, engaging in the construction of school buildings, and starting to raise a fixed fund of 300,000 from Nanyang and other places, recently, due to the feeling that there are many people in society, school students, and those who are interested in studying national studies who lack the foundation of national studies and have no opportunity to study, the National Studies Training Institute was specially established. The purpose is to promote and promote the national culture. For this semester, the institute temporarily rents a Western-style house at 4 Huanlong Road in the French Concession as its address. National studies expert and former Jiangsu Civil Affairs Director Hu Pu'an has been appointed as the president, and Ben Xuchuan has been appointed as the director of institute affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Qiu Feihai Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>After Completing this Season's Competition</p>
<p>Will Retire and Rest Next Year</p>
<p>Lin Baohua Talks About Zheng Zhaojia Going to the United States</p>
<p>Tennis star Qiu Feihai has arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, arriving here at 2 PM yesterday, aboard the French postal ship Ados II. In addition to reporters from this newspaper, Lin Baohua, Shen Kunnan, and others went to the pier to welcome him yesterday. After disembarking, he and Mr. Lin took a photo together. Although Mr. Qiu was tired from the long journey, he was in good spirits. Afterwards, he drove to the residence of Mr. Mears of Dunlop Company, where he will be staying. According to him, Mr. Qiu came here specifically to participate in various competitions in Shanghai, such as the International Robertson Open Doubles, which he and Mr. Lin have maintained. He will continue to work hard to maintain the glory he has already won, and he will retire and rest next year, giving opportunities to newcomers such as Zheng Zhaojia.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Lin Baohua's Lament <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>When the reporter asked Mr. Lin Baohua about the opinions published in the Japanese newspaper about sending Zheng Zhaojia to the Americas, Mr. Lin's remarks were quite far-sighted.</p>
<p>▲The Timing of Zheng Zhaojia's Trip to the United States is Not Right: It is appropriate to send Mr. Zheng Zhaojia to the United States. I (Lin referring to himself) made this suggestion two years ago, as everyone knows. However, revisiting the old topic at this time may not be effective, and it may hinder the progress of Mr. Zheng's tennis skills. It is better to wait until Mr. Zheng wins one or two championships in Shanghai, and the society's belief is better, the effect will be even better. As for Mr. Zheng, he should continue to work hard to improve his tennis skills.</p>
<p>▲Making Unwarranted Attacks is Regrettable: As for those who have recently attacked me personally, it is not worth laughing at. I am confident that my service to the motherland is worthy of me. The increasing interest in Chinese tennis is not without the impetus of Mr. Qiu and I winning the Far Eastern Championship for eight times. I have won three state championships in the Americas and various Chinese and Western championships in Shanghai. I have done my best for the glory of the motherland. As for those who use the Davis Cup as an excuse, they must know that the first thing we encountered was the United States. Who can defeat Tierdeng? The commentators did not encourage us, but even said that Mr. Qiu and I have come to an end, which is truly regrettable. After cooperating with Mr. Qiu to fight hard this year, we will give opportunities to newcomers next season.</p>

<p>Jiang Daozhang published a letter in the Continental Daily yesterday regarding sending Zheng Zhaojia to the United States, expressing strong support and praising Mr. Zheng endlessly. He said that based on past experience, Zheng is indeed one of the most promising people in the Far East. If Zheng can be sent to the United States to study for one or two years, he will surely amaze the Japanese at the 1934 Far Eastern Games, and it is not impossible to forget Boer Deng and American Lin Shanzhong and make a name for himself.</p>

<p>The Chinese Tennis Club has over forty members. Those who are highly skilled participate in various competitions in Shanghai. The others rarely have the opportunity to compete. Therefore, taking advantage of this spare time, they held an internal practice tournament, so as to benefit from observation and mutual improvement. The Fu Hsing Tobacco Company generously donated two silver cups, large and small, to provide encouragement.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Sayings of the 93-Year-Old Ma Xiangbo</p>
<h3 id="e161">Not a Single Bullet Allowed to Be Wasted Internally <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The other day, the Grand Alliance to Abolish Internal War Assembly appointed Ma Xiangbo and fifteen others as honorary members. Recalling the previous time Elder Ma replied to the letter initiating this alliance, he certainly supported this righteous cause from the beginning, as Elder Ma had long understood it. It's a pity that due to health reasons, he was unable to participate in this meeting.</p>
<p>When Elder Ma received the announcement initiating the Grand Alliance to Abolish Internal War, he told me to write a reply, roughly saying:</p>
<p>[Didn't I publish a warning to the people last year? I already expressed that from now on, I hope that genuine public opinion will be thoroughly and fully expressed. Unless permitted by public will, not a single bullet should be wasted internally; externally, not a single bullet should be spared! Now that someone has proposed a plan for implementation, quickly reply to the initiators, saying that I gladly agree!]</p>
<p>Therefore, I was reminded of two things.</p>
<p>One is Elder Ma's description of the astonishing speed with which Japan copied the American pistol. He told the visiting Japanese reporter that an American warship sailed to Japan around the time of the Meiji Restoration. The Americans on board gave the Japanese on shore two gifts: a pistol and an umbrella. Unexpectedly, the next day, the Japanese returned the copied pistol and umbrella, gift for gift, to the Americans. Elder Ma was not surprised by the Japanese ability to imitate. He was amazed that we still cannot fully utilize domestic products and have our own people manufacture modern new-style guns and cannons.</p>

He was amazed that we still cannot fully utilize domestic products and have our own people manufacture modern new-style guns and cannons.</p>
<p>One is that Elder Ma, reading the newspaper, often saw news of gunpowder depots being carelessly lost, and couldn't help but sigh: [There are people receiving salaries, but no one taking responsibility. That's why China is in such a mess! For example, with gunpowder, there is no one with scientific knowledge to take care of it, letting those irresponsible people destroy it all!]</p>
<h3 id="e162">One's Own Affairs <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Jinwen</p>
<p>The Sad People of Shanghai</p>
<p>Su Dongpo said: [An old man, seeing through the matter of life and death, instructed his sons on his deathbed, saying, "It is only appropriate to rise at the first fifth watch," and also said, "Only at the fifth watch are one's own affairs to be attended to. One's own affairs are those that can be taken away at the time of death." According to Confucian teachings, these "own affairs" are the great path of self-cultivation and establishing one's destiny, so emphasis is placed on the fifth watch, which is what Mencius called the "vitality of dawn."] Ordinary people are deluded by fame and fortune, indulge in licentiousness and extravagance, and most of what they think and do is to harm others and benefit themselves. Only when midnight dreams return and the morning bell faintly sounds, when yin reaches its end and yang begins to rise, do evil thoughts subside and good intentions suddenly arise. Those with great wisdom are often able to hold onto this spark of inspiration, guard it and not lose it, expand it and fill it, so that the mind is clear and mundane worries gradually disappear. [The inner ruler is at peace,] and life and death are both forgotten. Even in the final five minutes, one does not feel the slightest regret. Even after death, one can, with the power of pure and karma-free energy, be reborn in the Western Paradise. This is what is meant by "that which can be taken away at the time of death," truly one's own affairs.</p>
<p>Why am I writing this roundabout statement? Because living in a place like Shanghai, a few friends, casually playing a few rounds, chatting a few words, or running around, eating here and playing there, muddledly stirring things up, unknowingly, it becomes two or three o'clock. Moreover, important office hours and appointments with friends are mostly after three or four o'clock in the afternoon. If one gets up at eight or nine o'clock and goes out to visit friends, it is mostly disturbing their sleep. What fifth watch? What dawn? The situation and the facts are that as soon as one closes one's eyes, the most precious time of the day, twelve hours, passes by in sleep. So-called "own affairs" are simply impossible to contemplate, let alone talk about practicing them. Yet it is precisely the people of Shanghai who are the busiest, so busy all their lives that they have never managed to take care of a few things for themselves. Therefore, I feel that the people of Shanghai (in fact, not just Shanghai) are pitiable! Especially, I feel that Shanghai society is terrifying!</p>
<p>However, I myself am one of the people of Shanghai…</p>
<h3 id="e163">Going to Teahouses <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Ping</p>
<p>Living in the inland areas, unlike the gentlemen of the cities, they know how to seek enjoyment. Their pastime, when they are idle, is only [going to teahouses].</p>
<p>Therefore, every afternoon, the teahouses are always crowded with teahouse patrons who cannot be dispersed. Not all of these people necessarily have jobs, right?</p>
<p>If we say that everyone has a job, then they should not abandon their proper duties and come to this place to chew on idle gossip. Because not doing proper things and secretly indulging in ease is the most unacceptable thing.</p>
<p>Moreover, the majority of this group is still those unemployed people who have been squeezed out of society.</p>
<p>Friends, friends who love going to teahouses, look back and see if this era is one where you can idly [go to teahouses]!</p>

<p>— Bai Shi</p>
<p>Easy to Separate and Reunite, Simple Handiwork</p>
<p>Two days after last year's Christmas, a new neighbor moved into our side building. The male owner was about fifty years old, as thin as a tree trunk. The female owner was about twenty years old, completely a model of a young girl. It is said that their relationship was neither father-daughter nor father-in-law and daughter-in-law, but truly husband and wife.</p>
<p>Not long after, the Shanghai Incident broke out. The house we lived in happened to be a very close neighbor of the barbed wire, so everyone was busy fleeing. The sister-in-law in our side building was of course no exception. When everyone became tired of fleeing this March, they gradually moved back. The sister-in-law in our side building was of course no exception, doing the work of an old swallow recognizing its nest.</p>
<p>But a new thing was discovered. Our side building's sister-in-law fled with her husband, who was as thin as a tree trunk, but when she returned, she came back with a short, fat man of about thirty. It is said that her husband had gone to Hankou, and this short, fat man was [recruited] by her husband.</p>
<p>One evening in early July, a sudden marital conflict broke out in the side building. According to the short, fat man, it was because she was not behaving as a wife should; according to the side building's sister-in-law, it was because he was not providing for her. Crying, shouting, fighting, it lasted all night. The next day, the two went out together. Since then, for a week, the side building's sister-in-law did not return. The landlady went to inquire with the maid in the side building. The maid only said she didn't know.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the eighth day, a car honked loudly at the door, and the side building's sister-in-law returned. Strangely, she was followed by a young man in a very stylish Western suit. The next day, our landlady secretly asked the side building's maid, [Who is the young man that your madam brought back yesterday?] The maid smiled and said: [He is our young master, our madam's husband.]</p>
<h3 id="e165">Do You Want Inheritance? <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>Inspired by Li Minghui and Zheng Guoyou</p>
<p>A friend from Hong Kong came to Shanghai, and in idle conversation, he mentioned the lawsuit between Li Minghui and Zheng Guoyou. He said: Zheng Guoyou's instigation of Feng Deqian's death is probably not wrong. Fortunately, English law emphasizes evidence. The murderer is Zheng's chauffeur, who has still not been caught. Then, perhaps Zheng Guoyou's crime will not be established, which is also possible. Zheng is a wealthy man; he has several million in assets, all inherited from his father. He once brought 80,000 yuan to Shanghai, and because he was infatuated with Miss Li, he managed to spend it all in a few months. When he returned, he had to borrow money to travel. This time, the song and dance troupe went to Nanyang. He and Miss Li are old acquaintances, so naturally, they are especially intimate. However, why does Miss Li not accept being promoted by others? She is unwilling to grow old with Zheng Guoyou, but instead becomes close to Feng Deqian, who has no property? I asked my friend if Zheng's appearance was inferior to Feng's. He said not necessarily. Because Zheng Guoyou is also a handsome young man in this turbid world, his appearance may not be inferior to Feng Deqian's. If that's the case, then it's really as the Buddha said, the karma is predetermined.</p>
<p>After listening to my friend's words, I couldn't help but become pedantic. I thought: If Zheng Guoyou didn't have so much inheritance, he wouldn't have had this kind of distress. At the age of twenty-two, he is in the era of striving for learning. If he were a commoner, he might have become a promising young man in the future. Now that he has so much inheritance, eating without worry, it is exactly the ancient saying that "when one is full and warm, one thinks of licentiousness." Isn't this the harm that inheritance has brought him? There are many people like Zheng Guoyou in the current society, but they don't commit such shocking acts, so there's no way to investigate. But what I know is already a lot.</p>
<p>What I said in this section is too vague, but because of the inheritance, this promising young man fell into the trap of love and ended up in legal trouble. I heard that the new film "Revival of the National Soul" by the star [company] depicts the evils of inheritance at the beginning. All those who are already parents and those who are not yet parents should go and see it.</p>

<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>(Two)</p>
<p>Everyone in the town hates Yuan the Madman, but the situation when everyone in the town had fled empty during the war, and only a madman was left in the town, can only be described by Yuan the Madman. Therefore, after the war was over, everyone went to ask Yuan the Madman, wanting to get some real information about the war zone, especially Mr. Zhu Bofang, the local tyrant-gentry-style municipal committee member, because his responsibility was to make a memorial to report the situation at that time to the local government.</p>
<p>The general situation described by Yuan the Madman was like this - he described it unsystematically, but very vividly, making all the residents of the town very excited and慷慨.</p>
<p>[The small stone bridge outside the town has been dismantled by our army, and a temporary wooden bridge has been built. Trenches have been dug along the river bank. This trench leads directly to the Zhao family bamboo garden in front. A small steel cannon is hidden in the bamboo garden. Several gunners are squatting there day and night, lying still. At that time, I heard the rumbling of cannons and the rattling sound of airplanes overhead, especially the machine guns, continuously firing, deafening my ears.</p>
<p>I couldn't escape the town at that time, and later I couldn't even get another chance to leave. But later I decided not to escape, wanting to see what war really looks like. At first, none of the troops in the town knew that I was still hiding in my house, until one day, I myself didn't know how I ended up running into the trenches. They were very shocked and surprised. Perhaps my madness proved that I was not an enemy spy, otherwise I would have been shot by the army long ago. They all held me down, not allowing me to move, not allowing me to shout, not allowing me to look up and look ahead. At that time, there were scattered gunshots in front, followed by whistling sounds passing over my head.</p>
<p>[The whole town was as silent as death, not even the sound of people or dogs could be heard, but the sound of gunfire was a big exception. Once, I was a little panicked. When I was cooking at home, I suddenly heard a huge sound, like the sky falling and the earth cracking. The house I was living in was shaking as if it was about to collapse. The bowls and plates on the table were shaking to the ground. I hurried out of the house to escape! God! The house where Second Sister Yu lived had completely collapsed. The damned enemy planes, there were three in total, were still circling in the sky.</p>
<p>[A soldier told me that there were only fifty-two brothers in the entire town's army. Once, the front line collapsed, and this small town was very tight, but our Regiment Commander Yuan strictly ordered us not to retreat. Our company commander repeatedly asked for help, requesting that the cannons be moved back, but Regiment Commander Yuan did not allow it, only adding a machine gun to be deployed in the bamboo garden.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Financial and Gold Markets Fluctuate <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>▲ Small Fluctuations, Dropped Two Taels The Gold Market yesterday was still full of incessant waves, rising and falling, with a total fluctuation of nine taels throughout the day. The market situation was unpredictable and unstoppable, finally falling slightly by two taels. The opening was slightly soft, likely because the silver market was flat in England and down in America. Although the forward market also fell again, it was not affected, really because the current situation was not without influence. Later it weakened further, and with the exchange rate firm, Chinese merchants rushed to cover their short positions. Further, because large institutions were actively buying, with a certain bank trading USD for cash, people's confidence was easily improved, and the market rose steadily, suddenly breaking through the 710-tael mark. Later, because rumors were rife and the local situation deteriorated, selling pressure spread. When the exchange rate turned from firm to weak, the price of gold plummeted, from a range of 712 taels to 703.4 taels. In short, people were terrified and uncertain. The detailed situation of the market before and after is described as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Morning Market Low then High From an early opening of 705.5 taels for October, slightly lower by 0.04 taels. The expected continued narrowing of the margin from the day before did not materialize. However, with American silver down 0.25 from both public and private banks, and the exchange rate flat in England and down in America, the gold price stabilized. Then it increased to 706 taels. However, sellers were active, with Hengxingyuan, Hengchangyong, and others selling aggressively. Because the exchange banks initially bought October at 68.75, the gold price immediately fell more than 3 taels, with a quick reversal of over 1 tael, reaching 702.8 taels at a little after 9:10. Soon after, Zhenchangxiang came to buy, and banks dealt for September at 702.5, immediately adding 1 tael. At 9:30 it was 704.5. HSBC's listing did not change, and with Dalian Gang and others selling, it became 703.5 taels. After a while, Zhifeng, Yongyi, and Fengyong bought in, reaching 705 taels at 10:15. But with HSBC issuing September USD at 702.5, and Hengxingshunli, Hengyu, and others selling aggressively, it fell back 2 taels, reaching 702.9 taels close to 11:00. Suddenly, the Central Bank opened with cash, immediately becoming popular. Jichang, Bingxing, and others bought like clouds. At 11:30 it was 709.2 taels, with fluctuations of no more than 1 tael in between. At this time, Tongtaichang, items, etc. came to sell, and only a few minutes apart, it was suppressed by a little over 1 tael, to 707.6 taels. Afterwards, the market situation was quite good. Jichengfeng Yong covered by selling USD, and Fuyu entered the market to buy. By the afternoon closing it was 710.2 taels. China Bank absorbed this month's USD at 700.625, and the previous order of this month at 704.375 was available for sale.

<p>▲ Afternoon Market Softening, Colors Gradually Clear The afternoon market opened at 711.3 taels, then went from 710 taels to 711.9 taels, with Shunli and others buying in. Later, because China Bank released October USD at 701.875, December at 700.5, HSBC released this month's English gold at 704.375, and the market like Zhaofeng and Chang were selling aggressively, it immediately retreated to 708.8 taels. Suddenly it increased to 710 taels, because at a little after 2:30, the exchange banks had changed to narrowing the margin by 0.125 USD to 702.5. But the domestic market did not show good signs. September English gold was traded for half a penny. Mumbai sold December at 706.875. Instantly, rumors flourished in the market, and people's confidence immediately plummeted. The price fell by 3 taels, and Zhifengyong and others tried hard to sell. At 3:20 it fell to 707.5 taels, then it increased to 708.3 taels. After 3:30 the atmosphere was particularly bad. Zhifengyong, Zhaofengchang, and others sold vigorously, but the buyers were unhappy, and the exchange rate became weaker. Therefore, the price of gold plummeted by 5 taels, but the position was less than 1 tael. At a little after 4:20 it was only counted at 703.3 taels. Soon after it was 704.1 taels. By the closing at 4:30 it was 703.9 taels, a small decrease of two taels compared to the previous day. It then rose by about 2 taels, to 704.78 taels, then generally individual positions were covered. According to the maximum of 711.9 taels and the minimum of 702.8 taels in one day, there was a fluctuation of 9.1 taels. The open interest increased by 9 taels. The initial listed price was 777 taels, with a margin of 72-73 taels, 67 taels at noon, and in the afternoon the USD was changed to a small margin of 0.25, so it was also changed to 784 taels, with a margin of 74 taels, to 81 taels later, more margin than the previous day by about 10 taels. The ledgered price was 710 taels in the morning market and 704 taels in the afternoon market, with a water payment of 10 taels. There was already double closing at 704 taels in the afternoon market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the financial market situation, with the external situation turning better, the market situation was invigorated.

<p>Extremely Few Transactions, Prices Increasingly Stagnant</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 2nd), the situation in the various bond markets of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed no sign of improvement. The bleakness was unprecedented. Only the 1929 and 1931 Customs Bonds saw a total of 2,000 yuan transacted in the spot market; there were virtually no other transactions. October futures remained completely inactive. There were also only small transactions in the September bonds, totaling just over 400,000 yuan in the morning session and only 600,000 yuan in the afternoon, a total of 1,095,000 yuan. Regarding price fluctuations, the increasingly depressed overall environment further dampened market sentiment. Moreover, the situation on all fronts is currently brewing, and it is extremely difficult to predict what the future holds. This is why the market has shown no signs of recovery recently and is increasingly stuck in a state of stagnation. Yesterday, the price of each bond fluctuated by only a few jiao (tenths of a yuan), and even compared to the previous day, the difference was only a small fraction.</p>
<p>| Bond Type | Spot/Future | Previous Opening | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day | Volume Traded |</p>

The Dow Jones indices are listed below (in yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e173">Cotton Yarn Market Continues to Decline <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market continues to decline. Due to numerous rumors in Shanghai, people are panicked, and more retail investors are speculating, causing a widespread sell-off. The market is extremely weak, but Rongxing's buyers remain unmoved and are absorbing a large amount of volume. In short, the inventory of yarn is too low, estimated to be around 20,000 to 30,000 bales, making those taking long positions even more determined. However, some people are selling short due to the turbulent times. The fundamental issue still lies in consumption and stockpiling.</p>
<p>▲Renbiao Falls One or Two Li: The Renbiao market opened lower due to the further decline in American cotton, increasing pessimism. Coupled with many rumors in Shanghai, there was more retail selling. Prices for each month fell by four, five, or seven qian. The market remained weak in the afternoon, with prices falling another five or six qian for each month. The total volume traded for the day was 20,750 bales. Hengyi sold 1,000 bales, Yuanda 1,550 bales, Yilong 1,000 bales, and Yichang 1,000 bales. Taichang bought 650 bales, Yichang 850 bales, Changfeng 800 bales, and Rongxing 800 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Renbiao | Closing Price Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| December 1537 Down 11 | 119,300 |</p>
<p>| September 1535 Down 8 | 47,500 | January 1558 Down 11 | 186,400 |</p>

<p>| November 1535 Down 10 | 122,250 | Total | 555,400 |</p>

<p>| Inland | 70 | Amoy | 5 | Swatow | 5 | Ningbo | 10 |</p>

<p>| Sichuan | 175 | Luzhou | 25 | Zhenjiang | 5 | Fellow Traders | 25 |</p>
<h3 id="e174">Cotton Market Mostly Leaning Towards Selling Short <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market remains weak, and the situation is still unstable. Although the Shanghai cotton harvest is underway, the weather is crucial. Prolonged dampness would cause significant cotton rot. However, most are inclined to sell short due to the decline in American cotton, so the market continues to fall. However, a certain yarn factory is buying on dips in October. It is said that last year at this time, the factories agreed to a large quantity of American cotton. There are few reports of transactions this year, so they are taking steps to increase the price of local cotton. If there are no major changes in American cotton, there will be fewer downward pressures in the future.</p>
<p>▲Zheng Biao Drops 2-3 Qian: The Zheng Biao market opened lower due to the further decline in American cotton, dampening sentiment. Prices for each month fell by 0.5 to 2 qian. The market remained weak in the afternoon due to the poor yarn market, with prices falling another 0.5 to 1.5 qian for each month. However, private estimates for American cotton were greatly reduced, to about 11.37 million bales, a decrease of about one million bales compared to the previous estimate. The total volume traded for the day was 63,000 dan. Jifeng sold 4,000 dan, Hengyi 3,800 dan, Yuda 1,800 dan, Tongxing 1,000 dan, and Yuanda 1,500 dan. Yicheng bought 2,800 dan, Tianlong 2,600 dan, Yuchang 1,900 dan, Shenchang 1,400 dan, and Shenji 1,300 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Zheng Biao | Closing Price Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| October 3400 Down 31 | 202,100 | February 3420 Down 25 | 21,200 |</p>

<p>| November 3415 Down 25 | 289,200 | January 3420 Down 25 | 537,400 |</p>
<p>▲Raw Cotton Consumption Gradually Starting: Raw cotton consumption is gradually starting, and the factories are showing some appetite. The source is said to be 410 bales of Yao flower:</p>
<p>| New Yao Flower | 32.00 | Puyi purchased | 3,000 bales | Delivery to factory in September/October |</p>

<p>▲Cotton Market Rising Steadily: (31st) Tianjin report: The Xihua cotton market is showing a strong upward trend. The market was firm in the morning, and transactions were made at 29 taels in the afternoon's grey market. However, the increased appetite for raw cotton was affected by the sudden price increase, with just over 200 bales being traded. Furthermore, the Xihua American cotton market is booming and the Shanghai market also benefits. Yuji &amp; Co. bought 400 bales, with an opening price of 32 taels. After the transaction was completed, momentum remained strong, with continued reports of 32 taels and 5 qian.</p>
<p>▲Yarn Market Weakens: (31st) Tianjin report: Cotton yarn transactions remain undeveloped, and the market is flat and weak. Only 16 bales of Songhe brand 16-count yarn were sold for 138 taels, and 10 bales of Songhe brand 10-count yarn were sold for 124 taels and 5 qian.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Foreign Cotton Continues to Fall <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to positive news from Liverpool, but later weakened due to profit-taking and hedging in the South. Futures fell 8 to 13 points, and spot prices fell 10 points. British cotton futures fell 39 to 40 points, and spot prices fell 22 points. Indian cotton initially fell slightly following American cotton, but later weakened further due to profit-taking. Pingguoer fell 5.25 rupees, Aomula fell 9 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell 8.75 rupees. The original telegram records are on the left (1st dispatch):</p>

<p>▲South Shanghai: Yesterday, the supply from various groups was scarce, about seven or eight firms. Transactions between the city and countryside were more active. Dongxin Japonica rice rose by about 3 jiao due to scarcity. Changxi and Northern Japonica rice from villages continued to be traded and rose by 1-2 jiao. Sales of ordinary early and late rice were quite good, with prices increasing by almost 1 jiao. Fresh rice, on the other hand, was weak. There were no gains or losses for Xin Yang Du Jian rice.</p>
<p>▲Xinzha: The situation was in a slump, initially falling and then rising, boosting confidence. Transactions were not very enthusiastic. Northern Japonica rice from Zhongguan was bid up by 2 jiao.

<h3 id="e178">Wheat Flour Market Flat and Weak <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>A Glimpse of Market Stagnation</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat flour market was generally flat and weak in all months, both morning and afternoon. Foreign wheat quotations were down by about 1 or 2 jiao. Most people outside the industry are taking a wait-and-see approach. Many brokers have gone to Wuxi, leading to a standstill in transactions. However, with foreign wheat continuously falling and many rumors circulating, if sales in the northern routes are indeed affected, the future bleakness may be even more severe than the situation during the January 28th Incident. As a result, the current month fell by 5 li compared to the previous day, October fell by 7.5 li, November and December fell by 5 li, and January fell by 7.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Wheat Market Extremely Dull <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Weak Selling Pressure: Slight Upward Trend</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was calm in all months, both morning and afternoon. Although foreign wheat quotations were down by another 1 or 2 jiao, there were virtually no actual inquiries. The price of domestic wheat, however, is unlikely to fall significantly due to transportation and the current situation, so trading was exceptionally quiet, especially in the afternoon. September, December, and January all went unsold, reflecting the market's dullness. However, selling pressure was weak, leading to a slight upward trend. October was up by 2 fen, November was up by 1 fen, and the rest were unchanged. Spot wheat saw no transactions due to both supply and sales being quiet.</p>

<p>In Zhejiang Province, in the areas of Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Huzhou, and Jiaxing, the feeding of silkworm eggs for the autumn silkworm season is relatively smooth this year. There are also instructors making rounds to provide guidance, so the silkworm eggs are progressing well. However, purchasing leaves is difficult, and leaf prices are relatively high. The damage from the previous thunderstorms was minimal. Currently, the early silkworms have already gone onto the frames, while the late silkworms are still in their third molt and opening their leaves. However, continuous strong winds and rain in recent days, coupled with a sudden drop in temperature, have caused changes in the silkworms. The early silkworms on the frames are spinning silk slowly, while the late silkworms are showing diseases such as white muscardine, yellowing, and blackening. The silkworm farmers are all worried.</p>

<p>Metal Sales Show Slight Activity</p>
<p>Yesterday, various groups from Fujian, Sichuan, Shantou, Tianjin, and Yantai showed slight activity in the metal business. Therefore, the volume of goods traded in the market was higher than before. The total volume of goods opened at tea gatherings and market surveys reached as high as 2,000 to 3,000 dan. Among them, the Sichuan group was the most active in making additions, followed by the Fujian and Shantou groups. The Tianjin and Yantai groups were only making additions of assorted goods. The main markets for various goods in the market are listed below:</p>
<p>▲Galvanized Iron Sheets Becoming Increasingly Scarce: Various groups rushed to purchase galvanized iron sheets yesterday, leading to a decrease in inventory. Standards are increasingly strong. Even unpopular sizes like #24 rose accordingly, with asking prices of 10 taels per dan. #26 and #28 are also scarce, with market prices estimated at 11 taels and 5 qian. It is said that the arrival of the next batch of goods is far off, raising concerns about supply shortages in the market.</p>
<p>▲British Steel Plates Cannot Recover: Since the drop in prices for British steel plates after the spring in Fujian, there has been no hope of recovery to this day. Although the Iron Industry and Metals Associations have both expressed discussing price increases, no practical way to do so could be found and the market's price plans proved illusory. As a result, market sales continue to shrink, leading to a situation where recovery is unlikely. Currently, 2.5 li sheets are estimated at 8 taels per dan, 5 li sheets at 5 taels and 2 qian, 7.5 li sheets at 4 taels and 9 qian, and 1 fen sheets at 4 taels and 6 qian, all down by 2-3 qian compared to the previous market. If this continues, the future will be precarious.</p>
<p>▲Ribbed Steel Crisis Remains: Ribbed steel is currently estimated at 64-5 taels, lacking buyers. However, compared to the cost for other merchants, that is still a loss of over 10 taels. Although merchants in this business all want to maintain prices, the environment is bad, and foreign firms are selling off inventory, so the market's future is not optimistic. Moreover, recent overseas pricing is reported to be low, so the Shanghai crisis has not yet passed. Maintaining the recent situation can already be considered fortunate.</p>
<p>▲New Lead Wire Internal Demand Exhausted: The quantity of new lead wire opened yesterday was high, at 500-600 dan. However, the market price is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. Currently, #16 to #20 is estimated at 13 taels and 2.5 qian per dan, and #21 to #25 is estimated at 18 taels and 5 qian. However, actual transactions are down by 3-4 qian. It is said that the reason for the poor market is the low pricing and large quantity of incoming goods.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Selling Antiques <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Selling antiques is originally a very good business. In Shanghai, there are many antique brokers who make a living from it every day, solving the four major elements of life: clothing, food, housing, and transportation.</p>
<p>Chinese antiques are naturally most abundant in the Forbidden City, so antique brokers often covet them and try to find ways to get them. Unexpectedly, a lawsuit was filed against the Forbidden City for allegedly selling antiques the other day. Also, yesterday, it was reported that a Peking University professor asked the central government not to move Forbidden City antiques, and a Shanghai University professor inquired about the truth of selling antiques. Although President Yi Peiji of the Executive Yuan declared that he had sold 310,000 yuan worth of furs and medicines, I feel that no matter what the president says, it still feels somewhat irresponsible.</p>
<p>[Mosquitoes don't bite yellow ducks without eggs,] is a seasoned folk saying. Rumors of the theft and sale of Forbidden City antiques have long been rife. Now that President Yi has been sued and has indeed admitted to selling 310,000 yuan worth of furs and medicines, I believe that the director of the Forbidden City Museum only has the right to preserve them, not the right to sell them. Even those who are slightly knowledgeable should understand their responsibilities.</p>
<p>[Don't adjust your shoes in a melon patch, don't fix your hat under a plum tree,] Forbidden City antiques are not private property. The president of the museum, being in a position of suspicion, should have reported to the National Government in advance if he wanted to sell antiques, and could only sell them after they were approved by the National Government Council. Now, there is no record of this procedure. Only after the people discovered the lawsuit did he admit to selling furs and medicines. This is the first suspicious point.</p>
<p>Rice, firewood, oil, and salt have market prices, but antiques do not. To show his sincerity, the president should have openly auctioned the antiques to avoid criticism. Although President Yi admitted to selling 310,000 yuan worth of furs and medicines, it is difficult to believe whether this is true. This is the second suspicious point.</p>
<p>The Forbidden City originally had many antiques, and furs and medicines are only two categories. Now that furs and medicines have been quietly sold, it is questionable whether other items can be fully preserved. Because there are many people who covet them, Forbidden City antiques have been stolen and stolen once or twice, so there is an organization for the Preservation Committee. Now, they have the name of preservation, but not the reality of preservation. What are they supposed to say?</p>
<p>Originally, I absolutely do not advocate preserving these antiques, because even more important and more precious things than antiques cannot be preserved in our country. Petty antiques are only playthings for adults and gentlemen. What is there to preserve? But if you want to sell them, don't sell them this way.</p>

<p>— Chen Peizhi</p>
<p>Impoverished and desperate days, the hero's downfall is sad, people are cold and warm, but there is still a silk thread hanging under the city, why did he meet Mother Piao, a meal of grace was given early, when the withered tree meets spring, repay the mother with a thousand gold, a tall man of seven feet, ashamed to live in someone else's house, fortunately to be favored, women are better than men.</p>
<p>Feeling the Times</p>
<p>The mountains and rivers are broken like silk, the beacon smoke is bitter, the blood of Shenyang is tragically fresh, the seven-day cry of Qin will eventually be saved, the ten-year prosperity of Yue is not in vain, peace and harmony are all the plans of generals, reporting to the country should promote the whip of Zu Ti, to the warriors of Rehe, wave your spears to the east and don't delay.</p>

<h3 id="e185">The Method of Making Silk from Cotton <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Tianlan</p>
<p>Although silk is a major product of our country, it is very expensive due to insufficient supply. Now someone has invented a kind of artificial silk whose luster and color are completely identical to real silk. Non-professionals can hardly distinguish between them. However, the texture is slightly looser than silk, and it can only be used as weft, not as warp.</p>
<p>Wet Silk Manufacturing Method: Immerse cotton in sulfuric acid and nitric acid. After it dries, dissolve it in alcohol and denaturant and burn it with heat. The ratio should be about 40 to 50 degrees on the soda water meter. Then, pour the cotton pulp into a sand hourglass tank to filter out the slag, and then use a machine to squeeze out the paste, place it in a large tube, and apply heavy pressure to force it to 40 to 50 degrees. The water has been completely clarified. Then, pour it into a small tube equipped with a Cook. The Cook hole is as small as a needle eye, so the silk that is squeezed out is no different from what silkworms spin. Then, immerse the silk in water to bleach out the smell of alcohol, and it becomes shiny and colorful silk.</p>
<p>Dry Silk Manufacturing Method: The method is the same as wet silk manufacturing. Since alcohol and denaturant are very dry, the silk is dry as soon as it is scooped out of the water, and it does not stick when it is shaken on the bobbin. However, sulfuric acid and nitric acid must be completely bleached out, otherwise they will ignite when touched by fire, causing great harm. The method of bleaching out the acid water is to simply place the silk in an ammonium sulfide solution and immediately remove it.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Let's Talk About Improving Education <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>On August 16th, this association published an article by Mr. Xin Xi on improving education. After reading it, I couldn't help but feel something and would like to share my thoughts:</p>
<p>Yes, the relationship between education and society is very close. When education is developed, social causes will prosper and social happiness will progress. Otherwise, how can a country be developed and strong? Therefore, I believe that the reason why China is in such a bad state now is that the underdevelopment of education is at least a major cause.</p>
<p>The revival of Italy depended on education, the strength of Turkey depended on education, and in recent times, the dominance of Japan in the world has also depended on the merits of education. Moreover, history tells us that the development of education is indeed deeply related to the strength of the country, such as the Zhou, Han, and Song dynasties...</p>
<p>However, for more than ten years, the sages have been shouting to promote universal education, but to this day, they have not seen the popularization of education. The number of illiterate people still accounts for a very large majority. Where is the crux of the problem? I believe this is the corruption of education itself.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about social education or family education, let's just talk about school education!</p>
<p>Since the capitalist system invaded China, everything in Chinese society has become capitalist. Schools are institutions that hold a leading position in society, but how can they avoid this? Therefore, only the children of middle-class or upper-class families can inquire about the gates of noble (?) institutions.</p>
<p>I remember five years ago, a normal school student could pay a deposit of five or ten yuan and eat and study with peace of mind. But now it is not the case. Meal money must be subsidized at least four yuan, and textbooks, sports, library, medical, and experimental fees are two yuan each. Each semester, it cannot be done without twenty yuan. Thinking of the increasing collapse of rural society, one can only sigh helplessly.</p>
<p>Ah! Alas! Countless extraordinary talents have been buried here,</p>
<p>I feel that those who run education today cannot avoid having a kind of self-interest (in fact, everything is like this). Because of this, teachers with poorer skills can also earn a living by relying on powerful connections, and students with low academic ability can also be promoted step by step. Looking at any school, any school cannot avoid this kind of fact. How can the future of education be envisioned? How can the future of the country be optimistic?</p>
<p>I also feel that today's educators often do not pay attention to the four big characters of [learning for application][Although the formal aspects seem very neat and beautified, there should also be a good and practical guidance in the substantive aspects! Every year, a whole batch of graduates comes out, but as a result, many of them often suffer from unemployment. Why is this? It is because what is learned is not applied, and what is applied is not what is learned, that is, the graduating students cannot do their best for society, that is, the pointer of school education is not pointing to the needs of society.</p>
<p>Ten years of building up strength, ten years of teaching, saving the country depends on education, if education is not good, the country cannot be strong; this is my opinion on improving education, what do the wise think?</p>

<p>— Xin Fu</p>
<p>Sunlight slanted through the glass window, making the delicate and tidy study seem even more arrogant and self-satisfied. With a face full of smiles, she fondled a letter just delivered by the postman, guessing at the deep affection and sweet tenderness that he used to convey in his letters. She imagined that the contents within were sure to be just as sweet. Thinking of this, two small dimples appeared on her plump cheeks.</p>
<p>Carefully, she tore open the letter. Two eyes, full of fervent passion, unwaveringly focused on line after line of blue ink on white paper. From the first page, the second page, the third page, she read it all. But her expression changed along with the progression of the letter. Her skin, which had been flushed with red, turned pale. The two dimples on her cheeks had long since disappeared. Her eyes, initially wide open, were now closed. Judging from the situation, she had clearly suffered a blow.</p>
<p>[Could I have misread it?] She muttered to herself, struggling back from her dazed state. She still didn't trust her first reading and unfolded the letter again to reread it.</p>
<p>M sister,</p>
<p>I myself can't believe I'm writing such a letter to you. I truly shouldn't be giving you a letter like this, but I can't help but write it to you. I know that when this letter passes your eyes, it will cause you sorrow and pain, or even inflict unimaginable distress upon you. M, I have sinned, but... alas! I hope you can understand my pain, which may even be greater than yours!</p>
<p>Haven't you been worried about my tyrannical family? Remember when I told you, [Even though my family is tyrannical, they will never be able to destroy our love. I will repay your love for me with my courage.] Alas! How long ago was that? My words have ended in tragic failure, and your worries have become reality. I have finally succumbed to my tyrannical family, and our love has ultimately been destroyed by them!</p>
<p>Originally, a man who yields to tyrannical power and abandons the one he loves is, to some extent, a weakling of humanity. Alas! I am indeed a weakling of humanity. (I can only admit this, otherwise, how else can I answer you?)</p>
<p>[If you don't agree to a marriage arranged by me and you, then, go be free! Start from now, I don't care about anything.]</p>
<p>This is the [declaration] issued by my father. I pity myself, a young man still halfway through my studies, and even more, I pity myself, a lonely young man who can only survive by relying on my father. I know that this kind of declaration is completely unreasonable, but how can I resist him? However, I still have to complete my studies, and I still want to live to serve society. I also thought that instead of committing suicide due to oppression, it would be better to yield and stay alive to be a servant of society. I can only sacrifice the happiness of my life, and only painfully give up your love for me.</p>
<p>M sister: I love you, alas! Today, I can no longer love you. I have deeply failed you! The past imaginations, the future sweetness, all have ended here.</p>
<p>I'm heartbroken! I can't think anymore! I can't write anymore. In this final moment, I must still beg you, please don't let this unfortunate event devastate your heart. You are an innocent and lively young girl, you should realize that your future holds much happiness. Just consider me an unfaithful man!</p>
<p>M: Perhaps you can just believe in the karma of marriage! In a past life, perhaps we didn't plant the [cause], so naturally we can't enjoy the right to the [effect]. Alas! [Deep love, but fate not sealed] should be interpreted this way. Wishing you health.</p>
<p>From M</p>
<p>She finished reading it for the second time. She no longer thought she had misread it, but felt that every word was like a hideous demon trying to claw at her heart. Due to the unexpected shock, she finally tasted the most unbearable pain in life. Two tears couldn't be held back and trickled down from the long lashes of her closing eyes.</p>

<h3 id="e189">The Woman Selling Rendan <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Xiong</p>
<p>At that moment when the bright lights shone like daylight, along the bustling Fourth Avenue, in each restaurant, there was a fashionable woman in her twenties with bobbed hair, holding a large box of Rendan pills in her hand, peddling them to the diners. Looking at her beautiful face, though one couldn't say she was as beautiful as flowers or jade, she did possess a certain charm. However, her face seemed to hide a kind of sorrow.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I had dinner with a friend at the XX restaurant. Naturally, she came by as usual, holding her Rendan pills and offering them to us. I had drunk too much, and at that time, I could use some Rendan to freshen my mouth, so I bought a pack from her. Because I observed her demeanor and actions, which were unlike those of typical frivolous and unrestrained women, I wondered how she could be exposing herself in public, selling Rendan. Furthermore, observing the sorrow on her face, I was certain that there must be unspeakable suffering hidden within her heart. I firmly believed this and then aroused my curiosity, and unintentionally began to ask her about her background. She also thought that I was a kindred spirit, so she began to tell us about her life, as follows:</p>
<p>Alas, someone like me really has a bitter life. My husband has had no business for three years, and there is no one to take care of things in our hometown. In March this year, he came to Shanghai with me. He wanted to ask friends to find a position for him, but the friends couldn't find anything. Up until now, we really can't think of any way. That's why I came out to sell Rendan, she said, sobbing.</p>
<p>Then your husband is at home instead? I asked.</p>
<p>Yes! My husband is really a useless person. At first, he came out to sell them, but after selling for two days, he didn't sell a single pack. Seeing that our livelihood was about to be cut off, how could I just stay at home and do nothing? I had to come out and think of something myself. He's at home taking care of the children now, she said.</p>
<p>Then how much money can you make in a day? my friend asked her.</p>
<p>Alas! It's really pitiful. A few days ago, when it was hot, I could sell about one or two dollars a day. Now that the weather is getting cooler, I can't even sell one dollar. Sir, you think! In Shanghai, it costs money to sit and it costs money to stand. How can these meager profits be enough for our expenses? she said.</p>
<p>Then as the weather gradually gets cooler, the Rendan business will gradually become slow. For the three of you in Shanghai, even if you just talk about the lowest standard of living, you need no less than twenty or thirty dollars to maintain your life. How will you manage? I asked her again.</p>
<p>At this point, she began to sob again, answering me, Now we've lost everything. If we don't work for one day, we can't live for one day. At first, we wanted to rent a house to live in, but because we didn't have money, we had to temporarily borrow a small inn for half a dollar a day. If we still return to our hometown, we still have no way to think of, it's also just waiting to die, alas!</p>
<p>Then do you have anyone in your hometown? I continued to ask.</p>
<p>My mother-in-law passed away long ago, and my father-in-law also died last year. We don't have any daughters, younger brothers, or younger sisters. We used to run a foreign goods store in Huzhou, and we had a very good reputation. Later, the family property was completely squandered, all ruined by my father-in-law. Now we younger generations are suffering, I don't know what sins we committed in our past lives, alas! she answered.</p>
<p>After hearing the above words, I felt sympathy, and then comforted her with a few words. As I wanted to continue asking, she showed a distressed face because it had been too long, and bid us farewell. (Yet酬)</p>

<p>▲Luyin Plantation Promotes Fine Varieties of Seedlings The Luyin Plantation in Zhoupu, Pudong, was founded by Mr. Wu Jingcheng, an expert in arboriculture, and has been in operation for more than ten years. The jade dew peaches and other fruits produced there are delicious and sweet, far superior to those shipped from other provinces. Therefore, over the years, the supply has been unable to meet the demand. In order to popularize fine varieties, Mr. Wu has established a large nursery, specializing in the propagation of hundreds of thousands of fine seedlings, which are sold at low prices. The varieties are accurate, and success of each plant is guaranteed, to promote the spread of these fine fruits. A special Luyin publication has been printed, containing the business history and product names of the garden, which will be distributed to all sectors. If you wish to read it, you can send a letter to Luyin Plantation in Zhoupu, Pudong, to request it, free of charge, and it will be sent to you immediately.</p>
