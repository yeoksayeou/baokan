<h3 id="c13">五年計劃的先决問題（上）彬 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>據近來報載實業部正計議起草發展實業五年計劃。并規劃籌設鋼鐵廠及硫酸錏塲等。在整個混亂情勢之下。一切者陷於無政府狀態。成爲一團亂絲。獨實業部尙能注意於其所事。並尙能注意於進行的計劃。不能不算是「難能而可貴。」實業部有此發展實業的動機與計議。而社會各界竟寂無應聲。從無人加以批評或鼓勵。我們不能不承認這是社會的麻木。</p>
<p>在原則一方面說。我們認爲實業部的五年計劃。確有必要。不僅實業部。每一部門以至整個政組織。都應該有施政的計劃。都應該在有計劃。有規律</p>
<p>的行動之下。朝着一定的鵠的推進。但就事實一方面而觀察推斷。則目前實業部的五年計劃。有極多成爲「官樣文章」的可能。因爲在計劃之先。這裏還陳列着許多問題。假使這些問題不能先予以解决。則此計劃就令能擬成。也只是一種「烏托邦」樣的幻夢。事實上終於無法進行。更無法能促其實現。這裏陳列着一些什麽問題呢。</p>
<p>第一·實業部爲整個政治組織中的一部門。當然實業部不能超出目前混亂政治之棼圍。這即是說。整個政治組織健全。而後實業部有健全的可能。否則實業部决不能獨異。舉例來說。發展實業。首賴交通今日我國交通。事業之衰落。已不待說。而且軍人割據。内戰時起。土匪騷亂。交通常遭破壞。交通旣梗運輸無由。發展實業。究從何處着手。又如任何計劃之進行。必須資本。目前國帑百分之八十。都充軍費。政費僅佔百分之二十。國家財政枯竭。仰賴舉僨維持。旣無資本。五年計劃。又將何從而進行。所以在整個不健全的政治組織中。在整個混亂的政治情勢之下。實業部欲單獨作有計劃有目的的進。行事實上决不容許。决無可能。</p>
<p>第二·我國産業之落後。經濟之破産。最大的原因。是由於世界資本主義經濟勢力之束縛。從海禁大開以來。我國已成爲世界資本主義先進國的銷貨</p>
<p>塲。民族工商業完全爲其所征服。甚且完全爲其所操縱把持。其最不平等的現象。今日世界關稅壁壘。莫不高築。嚴防外國商品的流入。獨有我國爲世界關稅最低之國。天然爲外貨銷納的塲所。假如不提高關稅。防止外貨入口。不廢除一切不平等條約。收回一切已失的權利。在資本主義經濟壟斷情勢之下。發展國有實業。也正是痴人說夢。</p>
<p>第三·確定發展實業計劃。必先有正確的資源調查。和各項正確的數目字。尤其必先明瞭社會的需要。使生産與消費能相適合。現在我國不不是有一種可靠的資源調查表呢。是不是有一項可靠的統計數目字呢。是不是明瞭了社會的需要量和消費力。能使生産與消費適合呢。舉一個例說。我國現在究竟有人口多少。恐怕也還是一個不可知的謎罷。連人口的數目還不能知道。其他當更不必說沒有正確的調查和統計做根據。五年實業計劃又將從何處着手起草呢。更將從何處開始進行呢。</p>
<p>第四·三民主義的目的。在於建設社會主義的社會。但今日政治上的一切措施。似乎頗多與此目的相牴觸。蘇聯實行五年計劃。發展實業。是爲着供給全體人民的需要并使國家的經濟在生産與消費方面的各部分都能和人民的需要相適合。換言之。蘇聯的實業。是國營。是爲社會而生産。其他資本主義國家則反是。是爲利潤而生産。這兩條恰恰相反的大路。擺在我們的面前。我們今後發展實業。究竟是走資本主義的路呢。還是走社會主義的路呢。</p>
<p>上舉四個問題。如果不得解决。則發展實業。絶對沒有可能。所謂五年計劃。非以自欺。即以欺人。記得在國民會議中。曾定有六年計劃。國民政府成立之初。工商部也曾有舉辦基本工業。設立重要工廠若干的計。劃事過境遷。計劃都成廢紙。又從前農礦部爲金貴銀賤問題。曾命令某職員於一星期内趕造一開採金鑛計劃。起草者旣不曾實地調查。亦無數目字作根據。懸揣虚擬。閉門造轍。計劃草成。毫無用處。這樣的先例。在我國正多着。我們於實業部之想做一些事業。想有計劃的做一些事業。實不勝其歡欣。但在目前情勢之下。我們又深懼此次的五年計劃。仍不免於蹈上述數例的覆轍。所以敢舉前列四項先决問題質疑。</p>

<p>被殺船員六名綁架十人</p>
<p>此次長江水淺、上下游各江輪在營業上已受重大損失、下游太子磯淺水阻輪、上次擱淺者有七船之多、而近日雖經江海關淺量船查出有新航路一條、吃水達十五英尺、但甫經發見、猶未通航、而邇日下水各江輪之阻於該地、改用拖駁運貨轉裝者、又有八九船之多、各輪曠日持久、延誤程期、而行旅均受其害、上江方面、近日更因水淺阻船、發生盜匪刦掠、並殺害船員·綁架旅客·之慘劇、亟將詳情查記如下、</p>
<p>美山船員被殺美孚火油公司在長江内有裝運煤油兼載客貨輪多艘、往來行駛於滬漢宜渝之間、該行之美山號輪、今次自宜昌運貨、下水船中、未搭旅客、於本月七日船到岳州上流二十五海里地、名曰羊陵磯江面、適遇水淺、江漢關早發禁令、凡行走上江船舶、槪不准夜中開駛、所以防誤擱淺灘也、美山輪當在羊陵磯抛錨、候翌晨再開、詎料該地土匪甚熾、專以刦掠爲事、瞥見美山輪抛泊、便有大股匪盜乘入民船、蜂擁上美山輪圖刦、查美山輪中並無無線電報、在匪徒行刦時、袛得各取自衛槍械、奮力抗拒、總以寡不敵衆、匪盜擁上該輪、將抵抗之船員二人、就在船上殺死、棄尸江中、船内銀錢物品、悉爲搜刦一空、臨時復又綁架去船員水手等八人、據昨日滬上所得電訉、被匪架去之八人中、已有四人爲匪徒殺死、其餘四人、猶無下落、現在美山輪已經該行派輪拖下、而船内被盜損失、甚爲巨大、</p>
<p>捷江員客被架本埠捷江公司之上海川河直放班輪第二號船、由滬裝載貨客開往宜昌、至本月十五日、船到荊河口、之地名毡帽灘、因水勢淺落、照例抛停過夜、候十六日晨再行上駛、豈知甫經抛錨、即爲岸上土匪所知、當夜由匪盜率衆乘划上輪、刦掠該船、船主鮑二　Ｂａｋｅｒ在匪徒擁上輪船之際、懲於美山輪之船員被匪慘殺、深恐再演此流血慘劇、遂抱定不抵抗主義、故於匪徒上輪時、一任各匪行刦、不稍抗拒、故匪盜雖開槍示威、而並未傷害人命、匪等目的在金錢、除在輪搜刮現金衣物外、以不足匪徒慾望、臨行之際、又將船主鮑子·水手·兩人、及乘客三名、一併綁架而去、被擄之員客、已由匪帶至匪窟、爲勒索巨欵贖取地步、船内貨物並未刦取、出事以後、由捷江公司派宜昌號輪自漢口開往毡帽灘拖帶第二號輪赴宜昌、並請駐漢美國軍艦保護上駛、免再發生意外、自兩美輪遇盜、船員旅客、爲匪殺害刦架事起後、已經各該行報告美領、請鄂當局設法追捕匪盜、並營救在擄各人矣、聞我國海軍方面、已派軍艦至岳州上游巡弋、並保護往來之商船矣、</p>

<p>乙組五六七部均已結束</p>
<p>乙四七星衣隊明日决賽</p>
<p>上海籃球會此次共分八組、乙組四五六七部、業已結束、乙組一二三部及甲組、則於今晚開賽、此次加入甲組共十隊、即同濟·西靑·靑光·靑年·持志·麥令·眞茹·健華·華東·及楊樹浦·（即强華改名）各隊實力、至爲平均、競爭興趣、必勝於西靑籃球、茲將詳情探錄如下、</p>
<p>今晚四組比賽</p>
<p>今晚爲甲組之處女賽與賽者爲華東及楊樹浦、二隊球員俱屬海上名將華東有梁國權·歐陽永源·陳啟東·黎寳騁·戴林振等、楊浦隊除錢敬鏞·李汝純·馮徴華·孫寳慶·陸鍾惠等外、並月老將陸鍾恩加入、故實力殊稱不弱、今晚之戰、定爲中華籃球房生色不少、又乙組一部爲美意對南星、美童即美國公學隊南星、即交通大學隊、球藝不下甲組、屆時當亦有良好表演、今晚四組秩序如下、</p>

<p>健業對活潑乙二六時半吳嘉</p>
<p>美童對南星乙一七時半陸鍾恩</p>
<p>華東對楊樹浦甲組八時半徐振東</p>
<h3 id="c147">甲組各隊實力 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>同濟同濟大學籃球隊素有相當成績、近據該隊指導李繼元云、本季實力、勝於去年、季毓彪黎嗣林球藝大進餘子亦稱平均、將來當呆有良好表演、</p>
<p>西靑該隊即連執西靑籃球冠軍三年之海賊、其人才之出色陣容之鞏固、久已輩聲斯界、夫年上海會甲組冠軍、亦屬該隊、本季人才、一仍其舊、　標又有極大希望、華隊不可不愼、</p>
<p>靑光該隊已有悠久之歷史、今年在西靑籃球會中、已稍見退化、惟今有持志柱石孔廣益及紅隊名將徐克培、加入効勞、成績當大有可觀、孔徐二人固往年靑光部下、前靑光之稱雄滬上、二人予有力焉、</p>
<p>靑年今年之靑年、非去年乙組中之靑年矣、約翰大學林澤羣吳糼良、固去年老將、今除林吳兩人外、約翰陳祥龍·誠景星·侯學敏·及滬江吳國霖·王錫良均已加入、約翰在西靑籃球會中、名列亞軍、球藝之精、不言可喻、今並有滬江吳王二君加入、實力益爲充厚、大有擊敗西靑（即海賊）、攫取錦標之希望、</p>
<p>持隊誰都知道即持志學院隊也、惟該隊柱石孔廣益之脫離而入靑光、實力將受重大打擊、去年主將夏澤人亦已改入健華、該隊乃大受損失、</p>
<p>麥令該隊去年在上海籃球會中、成績頗佳、即本季在西靑籃球會中、亦殊不弱、人才有别許潑·亨弗萊·用勃龍等、並有新進名將多人、該隊亦有錦標希望之一隊也、</p>
<p>眞茹該隊即曁南大學隊當本季西靑籃球會開始之時、軍容頗盛、曾以四十二比四十擊敗江大冠軍持志、後以李城元之退職、黃兆霖之怠懈、成績較遜、如能精誠團結、則在上海籃球會中、仍可有特殊成績也、</p>
<p>健華爲也是與夏光合併而成、西靑籃球賽之末葉、該二　　鋒突出、一鳴騖人、深得斯界之注意、今有夏澤人·陳寳球·魏佐翰·及任傑星等名流、將來戰績、必大有可觀、</p>
<p>華東該隊都宿將經騐豐富、如能稍假時日、當不難恢復舊觀詳情已如上述、、茲不再</p>
<p>楊樹浦該隊爲滬江附中校友隊、實力已詳「今晚四組比賽」之一節中後起新才、斯界名流將來定有一番建樹、</p>

<p>馬來亞華僑足球隊再度來滬。勾留旬日。比賽五戰。成績雖差。而精神可佩。疇昔之夜。中華全國體育協進會。宴請該隊於三馬路古益軒。並邀中西足球界要人曁西人足球會上海埠際足球隊中華足球隊及各報記者作陪。計中西賓客七八十人。爲普通宴會中所罕有之盛况。爰記其花絮如下。</p>

<p>杯酒高歌西方風俗。在宴會時。禮有舉杯高歌。互相慶祝者。是晚中西混雜。亦不免有此種禮節。當主席趙晋卿（體育會董事）致辭畢。即贈馬來華人足球隊銀杯一只。上題『勇猛精進』四字。由馬來領隊余焯華君領受。一時咸舉杯高歌。祝賀馬來。此後體育會總幹事沈嗣良君對於西人足球會及新聞界裁判員等之合作贊助。亦表示十二分之謝意。而西人足球會會長葛林蕭及英國駐滬陸軍足球隊代表考的華等。對於全國體協會馬來足球隊及中華足球隊等。亦表示熱烈之慶祝。</p>
<p>預祝成功西人李思廉。僑滬有二十年之歷史。對於足球深知究竟。故資格最老。識見最深。而於華人足球界。尤多好感。今任曁南及東華兩足球隊名譽指導。在座談笑甚歡。並謂若曁南得西人足球會甲組錦標。東華得高級杯及施高托杯錦標。而中國得萬國足球錦標。是誠貴國足球界之無上光榮。言時。似抱無限希望。以目下形勢觀之。李君之言。非不可能。但望健兒努力奮鬥。痛飲黃龍。庶不負是晚熱烈慶祝之意矣。</p>

<p>醞釀已久之歲寒合作畫展。由名畫家張善孖汪仲山賀天健商笙伯鄭午昌熊松泉王師子錢瘦鐵馬萬里孫雪泥等所發起。延聘加入者如沈劍知朱少岳洪庶安王子原徐曉邨吳一峯等公舉薛保倫主持會務。闢新世界三樓三百十一號。每日午後合作山水花鳥草蟲人物走獸。爲期衹一星期。而已畫得精品一百七十餘幀。定於二十二三四日。假新世界左廳陳列。記者追隨其聞。臚陳所見。泚筆記之於後。</p>
<p>作品中以花果走獸爲夥。山水人物次之。均屬各畫家之結晶品。熊松泉之巨幅獅子。由賀天健補山樹。工力悉敵。山水之精品。如賀天健之摹董巨。鄭午昌之仿宋元。沈劍知之學文唐。孫雪泥之仿叔美。汪仲山之仿馬遠。錢瘦鐵之仿大痴。徐曉邨之學戴熙。均有獨到之處。</p>
<p>花鳥蔬果如商笙伯王師子馬萬里洪庶安葉渭莘等。均屬生香活色。名重藝林。</p>
<p>海上畫走獸者。羣推重張虎熊獅。得其尺幅者。視同拱璧。殊不知熊於走獸。無所不精。昨見熊所畫之白猿。由雪泥補紅樹。萬里補籘黃蜂。異常精妙。乃戲題於上云。夢裏封侯妄想之。天書獻罷轉尋思。如何不采技頭果。欲　秋紅寄與誰。即倩沈劍知書之。善孖與天健合作胭脂虎。最爲名貴。爲平時所不易求得者。</p>
<p>第六日詞壇健將謝玉岑來參觀。見雪泥所畫。泛棹圖。乃題詩云。載酒江潮醉眼寬。蕭蘆雪接天寒。埀虹重過如相問。倘有吹簫髻兩凡。吐屬絶似揚鐵崖。洵佳作也。</p>
<p>賀天健以善畫山水馳名。仁女從不肯輕易落筆。然每逢興起。繪埀髻玉容。不亞於玉壺丹旭。而秀雅且更勝之。所寫仕女一幀。姿色絶麗。風韵不凡。萬里即爲補梨花一樹。索余塡小令乃爲之題如夢令云。庭院風微寒峭。報道梨花開了。低髻細思量。愁緖萬千縈繞。誰料。誰料。消息於今終杳。</p>
<p>王師子以善畫花鳥虫魚著名。前夕見吳一峯來。忽興致勃發。乃與吳合畫山水一幅。王畫松樹山坡。吳補遠山。絶似天衣無縫。余爲題一絶云。漫天雲氣壓山低。萬壑千峯望欲迷。風定日斜松籟靜。有人策杖過橋西。</p>
<p>餘如歲朝圖賀天健之松。錢瘦鐵之梅。商笙伯之牡丹。均屬名貴作品。平時所難於合作者。計有五六幀。可謂盛矣。</p>

<p>電影明星胡堞女士之自述</p>
<p>一個故事，還在攝製白雲塔的時候，洪深先生介紹了兩位女演員來，伊們全有很眞誠的旨趣，很濃厚的興味，和很適宜於電影事業的體態以及其他。洪先生的意思，想呌伊們先來參觀我們的實際工作，使伊們明瞭一些工作的程序方式，然後可以正式的開始伊們自己的工作。伊們也都欣然答應了。第一天，我們的攝影工作開始的時間是在下午七時，但五時以前，伊們已經趕來了，一些不失望地等着這空閒的兩小時的過去，伊們細心地看我化妝，細心地看我遵從着導演先生的命令這樣做，那樣做燈光是强烈得眼睛也覺剌痛，表演是瑣屑而苛細得使人煩惱，攝影機發出催眠的可厭的的聲音，工作的人的一切笑語和動作全沒有半絲的自由，此傀儡戲登塲艱難得多，丨丨至少，在伊們兩位的心緖中，是這樣地開始感覺到了，否則，何以我們的工作還沒有完塲，而伊們就托辭夜深急於離去了呢？到了明天·一直到現在，伊們再沒有光臨過。據洪先生說：「伊們是知雛百逗了！」　囗剌激上面所講的一個故事，並不是我對於旁人的譏笑乃是我對於自己的剌激我那時雖然是一個平常的演員，但我常常聽見張石川先生給我們的敎訓·他說：「中國的電影專業，混亂到這樣地步，七八年來，雖然也有了些光明的萌芽但是還常常給某一穏黑暗的勢力所襲擊；我們旣然抱定了我們的向上的目標，要努力來建樹電影事業的堅確的基礎；講到努力，不是說一個人努力，要大家都努力，要大家都不怕犧牲，即使我們自身不能獲得成功，但是成功的路上終可以使後來者找尋到我們所遺留的影象的。」所以，我幾次因感受到了困若而覺得灰心，我幾次因社會間的不幸的指摘而學得失望，但我終於能振作起我們精神來，以期待着未來的成功。</p>

<p>從東省禍變發生以來，日人迭次希圖在上海暴動，畢竟在前日突然爆發，引翔港三友實業社毛巾廠被燬，北四川路各商店門窗都被擊碎，華捕被殺，行人被毆，這種殺人放火的勾當，公然在我國領土内幹出，而且於縱火之後，還召集居留民大會，决議請求政府切實保護居留民生命財産及日本應有權利，并要求日海軍陸戰隊負責防範。在我國内，任人橫行，國尙未亡。國民生命已毫無保障·我們要問我們的政府那裏去了。我們四萬萬五千萬國民又那裏去了啊！</p>
<p>日本人會燒殺，中國便只有聽天由命的坐看着他們燒殺，從朝鮮到天津，到靑島，徧處燒殺，徧處暴動，響應東北方面的暴軍·現在又燒殺到上海來了，將來進而至南京以及每一個都市，隨時隨地，都可以發生燒殺的慘劇。國人，摸摸你的頭，可有保障？你將還是鎭靜嗎？還是等死嗎？你還以爲東北陷落與你漠不相關嗎？</p>
<p>東北禍變發生，已經四個多月，政府只呌我們忍耐，只呌我們等死，旣不戰，復不守，又不和，天天向着國際聯盟的靈牌叩頭乞靈，從天津暴動福州事件靑島事件以至於現在上海的慘劇，政府都只有眼睜睜的望着，至多不過照例提出一個「抗議」。這樣庸懦無能的政府我們究要它有何用？</p>
<p>最近本莊繁陳奏日皇的奏稿中有說：「支那政府，久已成爲呼喚不靈殘缺不完的政體蔣介石雖甚聰明，但對國家思想仍不健全，所謂北上收回失地，無非無臭宣傳，毫無作用者也，至於汪胡諸子，亦皆毫實力，無絲毫國家觀念者也，張學良醇酒婦人，更不足道。······總之支那政府，實不足慮」。這話是何等的大膽，而又是何等冷峭刻毒呀！政府諸公其聽之！</p>
<p>政府是如此無能，如此不負責，所以抗暴禦侮，救國自救，皆全靠我們自己起來動手，組織自己的武力，澈底排斥日貨，人民自己宣布與日人斷絶國交，以必死之决心求民族的生存，必如此，乃能救國，乃能自救，有血氣的國民，起來呵！</p>

<p>在馬路上或衖堂門口，我們差不多時時可以看到一個鳩形鵠面的老頭或是一個小孩托着一個木架，架上一隻木盤裏陳列着一些雞子，陳皮梅，較糖之類，另外一隻碗，碗裏安置着四只骰子，你丢下一個銅板，便可一擲，當然，你的對手便是那只木盤的主人。假如你擲出的是「么」，而對手擲出的是「二」，你便算輸了，反之你便算贏·可以得到三塊糖·或一隻雞子。假如你賭的目的是錢而不是食品，照規矩「一賠三，」即你輸出的只一枚，而他賠你的却是三枚。</p>

<p>在前天的一個下午吧！我偶然經過城隍廟前的時候，被我看見了一件事情，覺得很有趣味，特地把它記了下來，給本埠增刋讀者們看看；也可想見一般少年的心理呢！</p>
<p>事實是這樣的··</p>
<p>「先生啊！發財發福，救苦救難的先生啊！可憐我一天沒得東西吃了，給我一個銅子吧！」一個形狀怪可憐的丐婦，跟着一個穿着很漂亮西裝大衣的少年一面跟一面哀哀地器着說</p>
<p>「滖，滖遠些！」少年惡聲的回答着，頭也不回地走他的路，但丐婦仍舊先生，先生，」跟着辭呌，走了老遠。我看了這種情形，老大的不高興，我想這個少年難道一個銅元也捨不得嗎？或竟他未曾帶着銅子（？）也未可知·········</p>
<p>我正在胡亂的猜想着，突然的，看見這少年從他的錢袋裏摸出一大把的銅子來，約莫有一二十個，花啦啦的一聲響擲入丐婦的破藍中去了··接着聽他說道··</p>
<p>「你這無衣無食的人眞可憐啊！······去罷，去罷。」於於這丐婦便灣着腰，千恩萬謝的去了。</p>
<p>「啊，奇怪啊！」我倒被他呆木住了，這少年先前是何等的凶吝，簡直是個一毛不拔的人；現在何以是又仗義輸財起來了呢？這疑團眞是難解决的呵！</p>
<p>親愛的讀者們！你想奇怪嗎？哈·哈，原來這樣的一回事；</p>
<p>原來在前面來了二位摩登女子，服裝極時髦，而且華麗，這少年看見她們，趁此機會故作慷慨慈善的樣子給她們看看，居然犧牲了一二十個銅元，還說些肉麻慈善的話，倒也算是大大的出一回風頭呢！</p>
<p>我再回過去看看那二位女，子果然望了這少年一眼，似乎也很贊成他這種舉動，是「難能可貴」的樣子呢！</p>
<p>「啊！少年的心理原是這樣的。」我當時不覺又呌了一聲</p>

<p>×官軍攻縣城</p>
<p>蘇松太道雖在外人保護之下逃入租界，但懼淸庭科以失城溺職的大罪，於是計劃恢復城邑，時新閘橋附近蘇州河畔駐有官兵，欲克復城邑，本非難事，但租界外人對於小刀會頗多援助，給養甚豐，故一時不能攻下。</p>
<p>吳健章購一小船，裝以小砲，率松江駛來之兵船數隻，於十二日向城邑轟擊，想炸毁城垣，但砲火太弱，終歸無效。</p>
<p>官軍探聞小刀會在租界某洋行購存大批軍火，遂决意衝入租界佔領是項軍火，派官軍一小隊衝至海關，正在提取軍火，忽有英艦「斯巴坦」號水兵數人，前來阻止，未克提取。</p>
<p>蘇松太道欲借租界外人勢力驅逐小刀會出城，但外人正以「隔岸觀火」爲樂事，並且暗中接濟小刀會頗力，遂藉口中立，不爲之助。其實這種中立的態度並不可靠，外人爲商業計，仍與雙方貿易如故。</p>
<p>官軍與小刀會戰地迫近租界西部，界内時有流彈飛入，居民亦大起恐慌。山東路之仁濟醫院，係由雒魏林醫生（Ｄｒ·Ｌｏｃｋｈａｒｔ）所創辦，當砲火之衝，但幸免於搶掠。因兩方受傷兵，悉送該醫院診治。外人之往滬西者，每爲兵士所毆，新公園及跑馬塲（即今勞合路）一帶，頓成危險區域。</p>
<p>×創辦商團</p>
<p>當時蘇州河一帶駐有官軍兵營，城内有小刀會，兩方兵士對於外人皆不滿意，租界内的帝國主義者欲乘此良機，擴充租界内之實力，遂於咸豐三年四月十二日，召集全體居民大會，所有英美法三締約國的領事與武官，一律出席，由英領阿利國（Ａｌｃｏｃｋ）主席，遂議决實行武裝中立，於是開始組織商團。並派法國武官第二盤谷步隊大佐冲生（Ｔｒｏｎｓｏｎ）爲司令，即日開始練習，從此以後，帝國主義者在租界以内有了充實的武力來維持他們的特殊利益。</p>

<p>Chiang Travels by Car via the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway</p>
<p>After Arriving at Tangshan, He Stays at the Club</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei and Chen Bijun Reside at Song Ziwen's Residence</p>
<p>Warm Welcome from Representatives of All Circles in the Capital</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the urging of the Central Committee and the nation, Central Committee members Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Nanjing from Hangzhou one after the other to address the national crisis and discuss the general direction of the new government. Chiang departed Hangzhou at 9:30 AM on the 21st, accompanied by his wife Soong Mei-ling, Central Committee member Zhu Jiahua, and a retinue of bodyguards, traveling by car along the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway. After receiving the news in Nanjing, Zhu Peide, Li Wenfan, Ma Chaojun, and other representatives from the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, various ministries and commissions, the Municipal Party Headquarters, district party headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Anti-Japanese Association, and other organizations, along with the National Government Military Band and the Police Security Team, went to Zhongshan Gate to welcome him. At 7:05 PM, Chiang arrived in Tangshan and, due to fatigue from the journey, stayed at the club. He postponed entering the city until the morning of the 22nd. Chiang's chief bodyguard, Wang Shih-he, immediately informed the welcoming representatives by telephone from Tangshan, and they dispersed. Chiang's return to Nanjing marks exactly one month from the opening day of the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee on January 22nd, when he returned to his ancestral home in Fenghua. Wang departed from Shanghai by train at 3 PM on the 21st and arrived at Xiaguan at 10:05 PM. Those welcoming him at the station included Sun Ke, Tan Zhen, Chen Mingshu, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Li Wenfan, Chen Gongbo, Chen Yi, Ye Gongchuo, Gu Zhenglun, Shi Qingyang, Ma Chaojun, Zeng Zhongming, and other key figures, representatives from the Central Party Headquarters, the Municipal Party Headquarters, district party headquarters, various anti-Japanese associations, various mass organizations, the National Government Military Band, the military police, and the Police Security Team, totaling approximately 5,000 people. Military police were stationed heavily inside and outside the platform. After the train stopped, Wang stepped off to the sounds of the military band. Wang was wearing a long blue cloth gown, holding his hat in his right hand and a walking stick in his left, walking briskly. He greeted those welcoming him, and they exited the station together. Representatives from the various party headquarters shouted slogans of support and scattered colored paper and banners. Wang, accompanied by Chen Bijun, traveled in car number 1361 to the Lizi Society for a brief rest. Afterwards, Wang, Chen Bijun, and Zeng Zhongming left the society. When encountering reporters in the car, he stated that he had arrived in Nanjing in a hurry and had no substantial news to offer, promising to invite them for a detailed discussion in a couple of days. He was now heading to Chairman Lin Sen's residence. It is said that Wang and his wife are staying at Song Ziwen's residence. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) After Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Hangzhou by plane from Fenghua on January 13th, he resided at Cheng Lu. Subsequently, he held fruitful talks with Wang Jingwei and Sun Ke. Sun and Wang had already departed on the 20th. Chiang had originally planned to fly to Nanjing today, but due to unfavorable weather conditions, he decided to travel by car along the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway. At 10:30 AM, Provincial Government Chairman Lu Diping, along with Zeng Yangfu, Lü Bichou, Chen Bulei, Zhou Junyan, Yang Mianzhong, Wang Chengying, Yu Jishi, He Yun, Zhu Jiahua, Zhou Xiangxian, and others, arrived at Cheng Lu to see him off. At 11:00 AM, the drivers brought five cars into Cheng Lu: Provincial Government cars number 1, 5, and 3, Highway Bureau car number 41, and the small package car that Zhang Jingjiang had brought from Nanjing to Hangzhou. Chiang and his wife boarded car number 5, while the other four cars carried over a dozen bodyguards. There were also two material trucks outside the gate, loaded with luggage. Due to the long journey, all cars were filled with gasoline, and each car had an additional driver. Those seeing him off did not send him off to the front gate, and the cars sped off towards the Hangzhou-Changxing Road. Very few people outside knew about it. Meanwhile, the provincial government sent a telegram to the military and police along the route, ordering them to provide strict protection. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Chiang's remarks before his departure were as follows: Reporter (Q): "Mr. Chiang, you are about to enter Nanjing. I wonder when you will depart?" (A): "Mr. Wang Jingwei has already decided to enter Nanjing. I will naturally follow him to Nanjing immediately." (Q): "After you enter Nanjing, what position will you hold?" (A): "I am entering Nanjing entirely in a private capacity to support the government authorities and will not hold any position." (Q): "Will you reside permanently in Nanjing?" (A): "I am entering Nanjing in a private capacity and will not hold a fixed position. If there are matters in Nanjing, I can reside there permanently. However, since I resigned, I have no official responsibilities, so all my actions need not be fixed. I am free to come and go. If the authorities seek my opinion on matters related to the survival of the party and the nation, I will enter Nanjing at any time to provide consultation." (Q): "What are your views on national affairs?" (A): "I have no special views. Mr. Wang's views are my views. After arriving in Nanjing, I will contribute my views at any time, but whether or not they are adopted will be decided by the government authorities. The government authorities must fully implement their policies." (Q): "You made a statement some time ago that you cannot escape blame whether you advance or retreat. Now that you have entered Nanjing, if there are still those who do not understand you or oppose you, I presume you will not change your original intention to take responsibility?" (A): "My visit to Nanjing this time is naturally painful for me personally, but the state of national affairs is such that I cannot consider my personal pain. I will fulfill my responsibilities based on my conscience and sense of righteousness, striving for public justice and private friendships, to support the government and jointly alleviate the national crisis. Praise or criticism, honor or disgrace, are not things I will consider or care about." (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Wang and Chiang to Decide on Policy Towards Japan First After Arriving in Nanjing <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Central Government Will Discuss at Length</p>
<p>Gu Weijun Bitterly Explains the Pros and Cons</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Important News: It is heard that after Wang and Chiang arrive in Nanjing, they will first decide on the policy towards Japan. However, the Central Government believes that this matter is of great importance and that the opinions of people throughout the country must be gathered. In addition to the National Crisis Conference, which has been decided to be convened on the first of next month, it is also planned that after the Central Government decides on a preliminary policy towards Japan, all military officers and local officials will be summoned to Nanjing for detailed discussions in order to ensure thoroughness. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun, under the orders of Zhang Xueliang, came to Nanjing to negotiate on Japanese relations and the International Investigation Team. He arrived in Nanjing at noon on the 31st and then went to Shanghai for private matters. He will return to Nanjing in the coming days to continue negotiations. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun, passing through Nanjing on his way to Shanghai, spoke of observing the recent attitudes of various parties within the country, which seem to be tending towards a path of severing diplomatic relations with Japan. This is indeed one way to proceed, but in my opinion, if diplomatic relations with Japan are to be severed, full preparation must be made beforehand, as a prerequisite. The so-called preparation refers to internal matters such as how to allocate military resources, how to plan finances, and how to replenish overall strength, all of which should be carefully considered. Externally, the liaison and contact with international parties is even more urgent. If these two things are in order, it is certainly possible to declare the severance of diplomatic relations. Otherwise, if relying solely on momentary anger and harboring hopes of a lucky break, the gains and losses after the severance of diplomatic relations are something I dare not imagine. Enduring humiliation and insult is certainly not an option, but staking the nation on a single throw of the dice is even less so. National dignity should certainly be taken into account, but the nation's survival should be preserved even more. Some say that if our country declares the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan, the international situation will inevitably change. This is indeed a valid reason, but it is not known that the major European and American powers are currently facing their own emerging problems and may not have the spare time and energy to step forward and act righteously to help the weak. At most, they will only express sympathy in words. For example, if a neighbor is suddenly robbed and one's own house is on fire, it is impossible in reason to abandon one's own danger to help others. The strength that the League of Nations has shown in the past regarding the September 18th Incident has already been recognized by us, and we should not harbor any further hopes. However, for the sake of its own prestige, the League of Nations cannot disregard justice and fairness simply because it lacks real strength. If the League of Nations can indeed decide on a fair solution, it is not necessary to worry about whether Japan will obey, because the League of Nations will have fulfilled its responsibility. If Japan still stubbornly refuses to obey, it is Japan that is failing to fulfill its obligations to the League of Nations, willingly violating justice and undermining peace. The force of world public opinion will also have a way to suppress it. The League of Nations Investigation Team has not yet decided whether to join. After Gu arrives in Shanghai, he will go to Jiading to bury his brother, and then return to Nanjing after the matter is completed. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e4">Various Ministries of the Executive Yuan Implement Streamlining Policies <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Redundant Agencies to Be Abolished Separately</p>
<p>One-Third of Civil Servants to Be Dismissed</p>
<p>Salaries to Be Paid in Proportionate Installments Based on Rank</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Various ministries, in accordance with the resolutions of the State Council meeting regarding expense reduction and staff cuts, began implementation on the 21st. The original staff of the Ministries of Industry, Communications, Railways, etc., ranged from 300 to 500, and now one-third are being cut according to the original quota. Other ministries will also follow suit. Those that cannot be reduced in terms of affairs may be reported by the relevant officials. Huang Hanliang of the Ministry of Finance has just arrived at the ministry, so staff cuts have not yet begun. It has been decided to abolish more than 20 redundant agencies in various ministries. Those outside the capital are not included. According to rough statistics, there are approximately 10,000 civil servants in the ten ministries and affiliated bureaus. Now, a total of one-third needs to be cut. As for the salary issue for personnel remaining in their posts in various agencies, the general plan is to pay (1) 80% to employees, (2) 60% to appointed officials, (3) 50% to senior officials, and (4) to stop office expenses and allowances. The railway, postal, customs, and salt tax agencies will be treated as a separate case due to the complexity of their services. It is heard that the personnel who have already been dismissed by various ministries will be paid a salary for the period from the date of termination until they are dismissed. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to implement expense reduction and plans to merge the eight sections of the General Affairs Department into three sections, to transfer the Public Relations Section to the International Affairs Department, and to merge the Intelligence and Compilation Sections into the Documentation Section. As for the Intelligence Department, 17 people will be cut, and the original five sections will be merged into three sections. The ministerial order will be issued immediately. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Expenses for embassies and consulates abroad have been in arrears since May of last year. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance actually disbursed funds until September and October, but the directors used the money for secret expenses, resulting in more arrears. Currently, more than a dozen consulates are unable to make ends meet and have begun to lower their flags and return to China. It is heard that Chen Youren will implement the abolition and merger of consulates in less busy ports to reduce waste, with the consulates in Chicago, USA, and Erbao in the Dutch East Indies, being abolished and merged first. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Secretariat of the Executive Yuan notified all staff members on the 21st to reduce expenses. The original budget of the Yuan was 72,362 yuan, and it has now been decided to cut the budget in half. Expenses for equipment and special items will be thoroughly reduced, and 20 people will be laid off. For those retained, salaries will be reduced to 70% for recommended and above officials, 75% for appointed officials, and 80% for clerks. Clerks with a monthly salary of 70 yuan or less will not be reduced, resulting in a monthly reduction of 30,050 yuan. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will form a Northeast Incident Committee and abolish the Treaty Committee, which will be handled by the responsible departments. The scope of each department will be reduced uniformly, and three sections will be eliminated. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<p>Battles Occur in Zhaojiatun and Wujiazi</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Volunteer Army Positions</p>
<p>Reports of Beipiao's Fall Proved Inaccurate</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang HaiPeng, after arriving in Shenyang, has received a secret order from Honjo to lead Mongolian bandits to attack Rehe. Cavalry brigades from the Rehe military stationed in Chaoyang and Zhang Shusen's brigade have been ordered to deploy defenses on the border in different directions to prevent the Japanese army from advancing along the Jinzhou-Chaoyang and Jinzhou-Dalian lines. The Japanese Murai Brigade launched a fierce attack on the volunteer army in Zhaojiatun, west of Dahu Mountain. The railway near Gaoshanzi was destroyed by the volunteer army. The main force of the Domon Division is opening up to flank the area. Fierce battles are currently underway. The Japanese army in Xinlitun is pressing towards Xinqiu and has come into contact with the volunteer army in Wujiazi. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Battles took place in Niuzhuang City, Huangshazha, and Bajiaotai yesterday and the day before. The volunteer army had a slight advantage the day before. Starting yesterday morning, the main force of the Domon Division advanced from Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Yingkou on three sides, and also used a large number of planes to bomb the Huangshazha area to assist in the battle. The volunteer army was unable to withstand the attack and retreated along the Liao River to the Dadu Niulv area. At the same time, the Gaoshanzi volunteer army was suddenly threatened by the Suzuki Brigade yesterday morning and lost contact with the Niuzhuang City volunteer army. Starting yesterday morning, the Japanese army in Xinlitun, Heishan, Beizhen, Yixian, and other places, with the Suzuki Brigade as the main force, united and threatened the volunteer army in various places, hoping to force the volunteer army and infantry and cavalry units in various places to retreat to Rehe, to the mountainous highlands around Yiwulü Mountain. Due to the difficulty of fighting in the highlands, a large number of planes have been used to bomb the volunteer army positions since the 19th. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a radio report from Beipiao, the situation of the recent battles in the area to block the Japanese army from entering Rehe is very detailed. It is sufficient to prove that the report that Beipiao was occupied is not accurate. The defenses east of Chaoyang are very tight, and there is no immediate danger. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army suddenly increased its troops in Suizhong, and its intention is unclear. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Three hundred Japanese soldiers arrived in Wanjiatun yesterday and are stationed near the station. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) On the evening of the 20th, approximately 1,000 volunteer soldiers planned to attack Niuxintai. The Benxihu garrison and police force received a warning and immediately took strict precautions. At 1:00 AM on the 21st, a train departing from Shenyang was attacked by approximately 100 volunteer soldiers from the east side of the track when it was approaching the south side of Shiqiaozi. A Korean woman in the train was shot in the head and died instantly. (21st Japan News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinzhou) The Japanese ○ Corps began moving east of the Daling River-Yingkou-Goubangzi line from dawn yesterday. The Saga Battalion of the ○ Infantry Regiment and the cavalry team departed first from Jinzhou to their destination. The ○ Field Artillery Team is also scheduled to depart from Jinzhou this morning. The main force of the Kamamura Brigade can be completely transported by tomorrow. The Murai ○ Corps is gathering its main force, taking a westward advance from Dahu Mountain. Once the opportunity is ripe, the battle line will be opened up in the ○ direction starting on the 23rd. (21st Electric News Dispatch)</p>

<p>Lord Lytton Formally Elected as Chairman</p>
<p>(Geneva) Lord Lytton was formally elected this morning as the chairman of the League of Nations Manchurian Incident Investigation Team. The team members, except for General McCoy of the United States, have gathered to discuss the procedures and date of departure for the investigation. However, the definite date of departure has not yet been announced. The committee plans to travel to the Far East via the United States, together with General McCoy. The team members are Lord Lytton (UK), Count Scotti (Italy), General Claudel (France), General McCoy (US), and Dr. Schnee (Germany). League of Nations Council President Briand announced to his colleagues today when appointing the investigation team that the state in which the investigation team began its work was different from what the Council had hoped for when it closed its last meeting. However, the solemn promise contained in the Council's two unanimous resolutions remains a formal guarantee to curb dissatisfied territorial ambitions. This gives the Council a reasonable and credible anomalous situation that is purely temporary and must be restored to normal as soon as possible to comply with the Council's resolution of September 30. In order to avoid the Council's selection of an investigation committee becoming a precedent, Poland has submitted an official document expressing regret that the representatives of the Council's non-permanent member states were not included in the committee.

<p>Adding a New Interpretation to the Words "Soldiers" and "Bandits"</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian published an editorial this morning discussing Japan's complaint about Manchurian bandits attacking Japanese soldiers, with a new riddle as the title, "When is a soldier, when is he not a soldier?" According to the newspaper, there are four lengthy articles on "The League of Nations and Manchuria," authored under the pseudonym "A Student of the League of Nations." The tone is clearly unfavorable to Japan. The answer to the riddle, "When is a soldier, when is he not a soldier?" is, "He becomes a low-class bandit if he is Chinese and does not make technically ready for war against you." The newspaper continued, "But we now know that the whole world will be able to decide very easily who are the real bandits in Manchuria today." The newspaper concluded by saying that Japan has inflicted an incurable and grave injury on the entire world political system. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Says the Chinese Government's Weakness Has Reached an Extreme</p>
<p>The Time Has Not Yet Come to Invoke Article 16 of the Covenant</p>
<p>(London) It is widely rumored here that the League of Nations Council will reconvene on Monday. China will invoke Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant to demand economic sanctions against Japan. Therefore, there is much speculation about what attitude will be taken in the upcoming discussion of the Sino-Japanese Liaoning case. The Associated Press representative visited Viscount Cecil, a prominent British politician, to inquire about this matter. He said that the question of "war or no war" has left the League of Nations at a loss, resulting in the inability to resolve the Liaoning case and trapping it in an unprecedented dilemma. Both China and Japan have said, "We do not want war." Once these words are said, there is nothing more to say, because only the two countries can speak of whether or not to go to war. Others cannot overstep their bounds and plan for them. The clearest thing about this matter is that Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant can only be implemented when two countries have broken off and declared war. As for the Sino-Japanese dispute, even the implementation of the economic sanctions in that article is problematic, because the two countries have not even broken off diplomatic relations. China still has a diplomatic representative stationed in Tokyo, and Japan still has a diplomatic representative stationed in China. The fundamental difficulty in this case is that people generally regard China and Japan as if they were European countries, but there is a big difference between them. The strength of the Chinese central government has reached an extreme level of weakness. We did not anticipate this when we held the Council meetings in Geneva and Paris before. When we previously asked Japan to withdraw its troops to the South Manchurian region, Japan asked, "If we withdraw our troops, who can guarantee the safety of Japanese residents?" China replied, "We can." This answer was certainly very powerful. Cecil also said that in his opinion, the Liaoning case dispute further proves the urgency of disarmament. Japan has consistently acted with force. To this day, the whole world has realized that force is a crime, not a privilege. What we see now may be seen again in the future. To avoid this, the first step is to educate people about reducing and limiting armaments. Cecil concluded by saying that in his opinion, the results of the Council's investigation team's thorough investigation of the Far East problem will be of great significance, and the future of all issues that are of utmost importance to the civilized world may depend on it.

<h3 id="e13">The Prerequisites for a Five-Year Plan (Part 1) by Bin <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>According to recent reports, the Ministry of Industry is planning to draft a five-year plan for industrial development and is also planning to establish steel plants and ammonium sulfate factories. Amidst the overall chaotic situation, everything is falling into a state of anarchy, becoming a tangled mess. Only the Ministry of Industry is still paying attention to its duties and is still considering progress plans. This can't be considered anything less than "rare and commendable." The Ministry of Industry has this motivation and planning for industrial development, but all sectors of society are silent, without criticism or encouragement. We cannot but acknowledge this as social numbness.</p>
<p>In principle, we believe that the Ministry of Industry's five-year plan is indeed necessary. Not only the Ministry of Industry, but every department and even the entire political organization should have governance plans. They should all be advancing towards a specific goal under planned and regulated action. However, observing and inferring from the factual aspect, the current five-year plan of the Ministry of Industry has a high possibility of becoming "boilerplate." Because before planning, many problems are still present here. If these problems cannot be resolved first, then even if this plan can be drafted, it is only a kind of "utopian" dream. In fact, it will eventually be impossible to carry out, let alone promote its realization. What problems are present here?</p>
<p>First, the Ministry of Industry is a department within the entire political organization. Of course, the Ministry of Industry cannot escape the current chaotic political environment. That is to say, only when the entire political organization is sound, can the Ministry of Industry have the possibility of being sound. Otherwise, the Ministry of Industry can never be unique. For example, industrial development depends first on transportation. Today, the decline of transportation in our country is self-evident. Moreover, warlords occupy territory, civil wars arise from time to time, and bandits cause chaos, and transportation is often destroyed. With transportation blocked and no way to transport goods, where should industrial development begin? Also, the implementation of any plan requires capital. At present, 80% of national funds are used for military expenses, and only 20% are used for government expenses. The national finances are exhausted and rely on borrowing to maintain. With no capital, how will the five-year plan proceed? Therefore, in the entire unsound political organization, and under the entire chaotic political situation, it is factually impossible for the Ministry of Industry to independently make planned and purposeful progress. It is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Second, the biggest reason for the backwardness of our country's industry and the bankruptcy of its economy is due to the constraints of the economic forces of global capitalism. Since the opening of the sea ban, our country has become a sales market for advanced capitalist countries. National industry and commerce have been completely conquered by them, and even completely manipulated and controlled by them. The most unequal phenomenon is that today, the world's tariff barriers are built high, strictly preventing the inflow of foreign goods. Only our country is the country with the lowest tariffs in the world, a natural place for foreign goods to be sold. If tariffs are not raised to prevent the import of foreign goods, and if all unequal treaties are not abolished and all lost rights are not recovered, then developing state-owned industries under the monopolistic situation of capitalist economy is just a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Third, to determine a plan for industrial development, there must first be an accurate resource survey and various accurate figures. In particular, it is necessary to first understand the needs of society so that production and consumption can be matched. Does our country now have a reliable resource survey table? Is there a reliable statistical figure? Is the amount of social needs and purchasing power understood, so that production and consumption can be matched? To give an example, how many people are there in our country now? I am afraid it is still an unknowable mystery. Even the number of people cannot be known, not to mention other things. Without accurate surveys and statistics as a basis, where will the five-year industrial plan begin to draft? Where will it begin to proceed?</p>
<p>Fourth, the purpose of the Three Principles of the People is to build a socialist society. However, today's political measures seem to contradict this purpose in many ways. The Soviet Union implemented the five-year plan to develop industry to meet the needs of all the people and to make the various parts of the national economy in terms of production and consumption suitable for the needs of the people. In other words, the industry of the Soviet Union is state-owned and produces for society. Other capitalist countries are the opposite. They produce for profit. These two completely opposite paths are in front of us. In the future, which path will we take to develop industry, the capitalist path or the socialist path?</p>
<p>If the above four problems are not resolved, then there is absolutely no possibility of developing industry. The so-called five-year plan is either self-deception or deceiving others. I remember that a six-year plan was set in the National Assembly. At the beginning of the establishment of the National Government, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce also had plans to establish basic industries and set up a number of important factories. As time passed, the plans became waste paper. Also, in the past, the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, because of the problem of gold being expensive and silver being cheap, ordered a certain staff member to rush to create a plan to exploit gold mines within a week. The drafter did not conduct on-site investigations and had no statistics as a basis. He made conjectures and created a plan behind closed doors. The plan was drafted but was of no use. There are many such precedents in our country. We are very happy that the Ministry of Industry wants to do some things and wants to do things in a planned way. However, under the current situation, we are deeply afraid that this five-year plan will still inevitably follow the same path as the above examples. Therefore, we dare to raise the four prerequisites listed above for questioning.</p>

<p>Adopting a Tricolor Flag</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the 15th, after important Japanese military officials in Shenyang and traitors such as Zang Shiyi and Jin Liang negotiated a plan to establish a puppet Northeast new country, the result was a decision to establish it on February 10th, adopting provincial autonomy. The national flag will use red, yellow, and black to express separation from the Republic of China. The All-Manchuria Japanese Situation Support Association also issued a declaration on the new Manchuria-Mongolia regime, which is extremely insulting to our country and people. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Special News: Zang Shiyi does not quite agree with the restoration of the monarchy, and his views are at odds with Zheng Xiaoxu, Zhang Zhenyu, Jin Liang, and others. Yuan Jinkai, Yu Chonghan, and their faction only care about maintaining the local area and do not care about the form of government. Therefore, the meeting has been held for several days, but there are still no concrete measures. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) British and American officials have received a report from Pan Fang, stating that the rumor that Japan is supporting Puyi as president has not been confirmed. Japan is indeed using Zang Shiyi, Zhang Jinghui, Xi Qia, and other pro-Japanese factions to rule Fengtian, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. On the anti-Zhang stance, they have formed a special government that is separate from the central government. Moreover, Jehol's refusal to allow Fengtian troops to retreat into its territory seems to have some understanding with the Japanese. Also, certain Mongolian princes in Inner Mongolia also show signs of favoring Japan. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) National Government Order on the 21st: "The failure of the country is due to corrupt officials. In the past, warlords held power, bribery was rampant, politics were corrupt, and the people's grievances were deep. Since the establishment of the National Government, it has been wiping out corruption and severely punishing greed, hoping to create a clean government and truly achieve political innovation. However, due to repeated military conflicts, we have failed to focus on rectifying officialdom, so the trend of corruption has not been completely eliminated. Now that unification has been completed and a new beginning has been made with the people, the most important task is to rectify discipline. Moreover, at a time when disasters are frequent, how can we diligently address the people's needs if we do not eradicate greed? With the national crisis becoming more urgent, how can we resist foreign insults if we do not improve domestic administration? Hereafter, all departments, ministries, and committees, as well as local officials, must cultivate integrity and lead by example. If their subordinates have acts of corruption, they must immediately report them and not show any favoritism. The Control Yuan and the disciplinary and judicial organs, in particular, must immediately impeach and punish according to the law any civil servants who engage in embezzlement, bribery, or dereliction of duty, so as to rectify officialdom and demonstrate the rule of law. This order." (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Reason Given: Inability to Implement Policies</p>
<p>General Election Scheduled for the 20th of Next Month</p>
<p>Azawa Delivers Speech on Diplomacy</p>
<p>Engages in Sophistry Regarding the Liaoning Case</p>
<p>The 60th Session of Parliament was dissolved at 3:25 PM on the 21st. The general election is scheduled for February 20th. (Jiji Press, Tokyo, 21st)</p>
<p>The government announced the reasons for the dissolution as follows: "Because the government holds a minority in Parliament, it keenly feels its inability to implement policies effectively. For example, the financial policy regarding the prohibition of gold exports is already at odds with the government's views. The ruling and opposition parties completely disagree on all other policy guidelines. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely dissolve [Parliament] and appeal to the people to decide what is right and wrong." (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>The House of Representatives convened at 1:00 PM today, earlier than the House of Peers. First, Prime Minister Inukai delivered a speech, stating briefly that since the current government's establishment, it immediately ordered the lifting of the gold embargo and cancelled the tax increase bill. Fortunately, since implementing these policies, the economic situation has greatly improved. He then explained the recent events surrounding the Emperor's shock and the Cabinet's resignation process. Finally, he mentioned the Liaoning case, saying that guaranteeing lasting peace in the Far East remains the government's ambition. (Kokumin News Agency)</p>
<p>Next, Foreign Minister Azawa delivered a speech on Japanese foreign policy, referring to Manchuria as the key to peace in the Far East. He said that Manchuria is an extremely important issue for Japan at present, and also an issue of great concern to the entire world. He then detailed the reasons for Japan's actions in Manchuria, saying that China disregarded the treaty and treaty rights, and ignored Japan's warnings and protests, leading to the destruction of railways and clashes between Chinese and Japanese troops. He also said that before the Russo-Japanese War, Manchuria was already the key to peace in the Far East, and this is even more true today. Japan has always borne the responsibility for peace and order in Manchuria, and this responsibility has become even greater today. However, Japan does not harbor any ambition for Manchurian territory, and will maintain the principles of open door and equal opportunity. Azawa then spoke about the anti-Japanese movement in China, blaming the Chinese government for directly and indirectly promoting the anti-Japanese movement. Azawa later mentioned the League of Nations and the United States, saying that after the Japanese government's clear explanation, the League of Nations and the United States now understand Japan's position on Manchuria better than before, and the neutrality and non-interference of Soviet Russia is also particularly gratifying. Azawa concluded by saying that the disarmament conference is about to open, and he hopes that it will establish a rational, equal, and helpful agreement for lasting world peace. (Reuters)</p>
<p>Finally, Finance Minister Takahashi rose to deliver a speech, attacking the financial and economic policies of former Finance Minister Inoue, saying that Japan's current recession is largely the result of the Minseito government's abolition of the gold embargo, which led to a large outflow of cash. The previous government sold US dollars through the Yokohama Specie Bank, causing the country to suffer a great loss. The current government's policy of re-establishing the gold embargo is based on the belief that this measure can alleviate the current recession and help develop domestic industries and restore confidence in foreign trade. (Reuters)</p>
<p>After the Finance Minister's speech, an imperial edict dissolving Parliament was suddenly issued. Speaker Nakamura ordered everyone to stand, and the edict was read aloud on the spot. It was 3:25 PM, and Parliament was dissolved as expected. The House of Peers also adjourned immediately. At the same time, the ruling and opposition parties and the Proletarian Party held plenary delegate meetings within the Parliament. The Minseito Party issued a statement, criticizing the government as a destroyer of political morality and also a destroyer of the national economy. It also rebuked the Inukai Cabinet for resorting to this low tactic because it could not withstand the just deliberations of both Houses, regarding it as the first sound of toppling the cabinet.

<p>French and German Views on Reparations Issue Diverge</p>
<p>Negotiations Among Signatory Countries Are in Progress</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st – The British Foreign Office issued a statement last night stating that talks among the governments concerned with the Lausanne Reparations Conference have not yet concluded, so the conference cannot open on January 25th. The talks are still in progress, and the British government hopes to reach a satisfactory agreement on the procedures to be adopted in the coming days. Since the reparations conference was initiated by Britain, this statement can be regarded as a announcement of the postponement of the conference. According to Reuters' Berlin dispatch, the news of the postponement of the reparations conference arrived in Berlin late, and officials were unable to comment on it. However, there is no doubt that German political circles deeply regret this development, fearing that it will increase the economic difficulties not only for Germany, but for the entire world. People in Berlin believe that if the postponement is only for one or two weeks, it will not cause much harm. However, according to news from Paris, France is now trying its best to ① avoid a concrete resolution of the reparations issue, and ② delay President Hoover's moratorium plan to suit the needs of French domestic politics. Many German newspapers this morning said that France's plan to sabotage the reparations conference has already succeeded. The German government said that Germany will not allow the Hoover moratorium plan to be delayed until 1933, as this would make the reparations issue impossible to resolve for the time being, while Germany wants to resolve it before the end of the year. French Prime Minister Laval's statement that France cannot sacrifice its claims unless its debts are equally reduced seems to have made the situation even more serious, and shows the great divergence of views between France and Germany. It is expected that Germany's first step will be to publish figures to show that Germany has already paid more for the repair of war-torn areas than France should have received. German newspapers say that the French Prime Minister's remarks have clearly revealed the spirit that France will hold in the Lausanne talks, that is, to absolutely refuse to cancel reparations. However, it is hoped that the French Prime Minister's remarks are not the final word of France on this matter, because if it is according to the French Prime Minister's remarks, then France wants Germany to pay huge sums again when its economic situation improves slightly, resulting in Germany's economic situation inevitably deteriorating again in the future.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 21st – US officials delivered a memorandum to the French Ambassador to the United States last week, detailing the US decision that the US Congress may not agree to extend the moratorium period for European debtor countries. The content of this memorandum was disclosed today. The attitude of Ambassador Edge to France during his meeting with French Prime Minister Laval last Saturday and Sunday was dominated by this content. The memorandum contained the following points: The US government does not recognize any connection between reparations and war debts. The US believes that the reparations issue must be handled autonomously by European countries. There is no opportunity for the US Congress to approve requests for debt moratorium. The US does not welcome any move by its debtor countries to unite and present a common demand, because the existing debt settlement methods are formed separately and can only be revised separately thereafter. The US cannot give it general understanding. The memorandum also stated that if European countries restore their mutual trust and reduce military expenditures, they can repay their debts. This article from the US can almost be regarded as the final article on this issue at present, so France now only has to inform the US government alone or jointly with Britain, etc., that since Germany has not paid, the US's debtor countries will also be unable to pay their debts.</p>

<p>Will Not Reduce a Single Soldier Without Security Guarantees</p>
<p>Kokumin, Paris, 20th – The world powers will gather in Geneva on February 2nd to hold a disarmament conference. France's position can be predicted, that is, it will not reduce a single cannon or soldier without obtaining security guarantees. This is because the French parliament, newspapers, and people all remember being invaded by foreign enemies twice in 50 years. Unless they obtain full guarantees from the powers, they are unwilling to sacrifice any military equipment. If the government goes against their wishes, it will not be able to maintain its position. Reuters, Paris, 20th – General Boschhard and Attorney Echard, members of the French Senate's commission investigating armaments, reported startling news to the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee today. According to reports, Germany is secretly preparing a large army in violation of the provisions of the peace treaty. Boschhard said that Germany is organizing its industries and armaments on parallel lines, so military supplies can be requisitioned quickly. Germany is also carrying out extremely active propaganda to cultivate a spirit of revenge, even in elementary schools. Echard said that the German budget contains military expenditures under items used to cover people's ears and eyes, the amount of which far exceeds what the peace treaty allows. This report has made a deep impression on the Foreign Affairs Committee and will be discussed again at a later date.</p>

<p>To the Newspaper Offices in Nanjing, for your information. Recently, we have read in various newspapers in Shanghai about the Shanghai Youth Anti-Japanese National Salvation Death Squad, led by Wu and Ye Bin on the afternoon of the 16th, going to the Ministry of Military Affairs to request firearms and ammunition, resulting in a conflict with the duty officer and guards. Wu and Ye were both injured, and all the members were said to have been detained, which is not in accordance with the facts. It was found that at about 7:00 PM, a person claiming to be Ye Bin, the chairman of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation [group], and the commander Wu Mai, led dozens of members into this Ministry, requesting to meet with the Minister and Vice Minister. Wu Mai gave a speech, saying that they were not here to petition, but to question: (1) Why are no troops being sent to resist Japan? (2) Demanding the dismissal of the existing troops. (3) Demanding the issuance of firearms and ammunition. (4) Issuing salaries and clothing. (5) Sending capable military officers to train the members of the [Death] Squad. And setting a deadline of 9:00 PM to reply, otherwise they would burn down the Ministry of Military Affairs. The duty officer kindly advised that the first two items requested were beyond the scope of the Ministry's responsibilities and powers, and should be submitted to the National Government for instructions. As for the third and fourth items, although this Ministry is the military's supply agency, it should also follow the orders of the National Government. However, Wu Mai refused to listen to the advice and instead resorted to insults and abuse, trying to incite the members to carry out destructive work, and personally took the national flag and smashed the glass signs in the Ministry's office. Seeing this outrage, the Ministry's servants stepped forward to stop it. Wu Mai then claimed to have been beaten and refused to leave the Ministry. However, the members of the [Death] Squad deeply understood the great righteousness, and seeing this absurd behavior, they dispersed immediately. Wu Mai was also persuaded by Vice Minister Cao to leave the Ministry the next morning. Now this dispute has been resolved. Fearing that the rumors are untrue, the course of events is specially reported to your esteemed newspaper, hoping that it will be published so that readers can understand the truth. We would be very grateful. [Official Seal of the] Ministry of Military Affairs.</p>

<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Because the salary of the Third Route Army under Han Fuqu is not available, he temporarily sent personnel to take over the central tax revenue agencies in Shandong. Most of the central tax revenue agencies in Qingdao City are under the jurisdiction of the Jinan area.

The takeover situation is recorded as follows: (1) Zhao Zuolin of the Jiao'ao Salt Field was appointed by Li Wuchen, Shandong Salt Transport Envoy, as the chief of the Jiao'ao Supervision and Police Field. He arrived in Qingdao the day before yesterday with six attendants. Because the former chief Hu Weiqi had not received news of the change beforehand, he had not prepared for the matters that should be handed over. Therefore, although Zhao came to Qingdao, he could not take office for a while. Hu is now rushing to complete the handover. In addition, the position of Resident Qingdao Salt Affairs Officer has been filled by Xing Lantian, Director of the Jinan Municipal Finance Bureau, appointed by the province. Xing arrived in Qingdao on the 16th and officially took office on the 18th.</p>

<p>Authorities Plan to Establish Pacification Office Under the Political Affairs Council</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the establishment of the unified government, the Guangzhou National Government and the Central Party Headquarters have been successively abolished. However, in the southwest, according to the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Guangzhou [Kuomintang Central Executive Committee], it is planned to still establish three organizations in Guangdong: the Southwest Executive Department of the Central Party Headquarters, the Southwest Political Affairs Council, and the Southwest Military Council. The organizational laws have been drafted and submitted to the government for record. It is reported that the government has only approved the registration of the Political Affairs Council for the three organizations, and the Military Council is not to be discussed. The authorities believe that the military and political affairs of the southwestern provinces cannot be without a command organization to coordinate the pacification and suppression of bandits. Now that the Military Council has not been approved for registration, and the pacification command cannot be without a unified organization, it is planned to change the method and form a Southwest Pacification Office under the Political Affairs Council. The office can directly command the southwestern provinces to handle the pacification and suppression of bandits. The organizational law is currently being drafted by the Guangdong and Guangxi military authorities and will be submitted for discussion at the next meeting of the Political Affairs Council. The organizational regulations of the Southwest Political Affairs Council are as follows: (Article 1) The National Government, in accordance with the resolutions of the Fourth National Congress [of the Kuomintang], establishes the Southwest Political Affairs Council, which is directly under the National Government, to supervise and direct the following administrative and auditing matters within the southwestern region: (1) Internal affairs, (2) Military affairs, (3) Finance, (4) Transportation, (5) Industry, (6) Education, (7) Judicial administration. (Article 2) The Southwest Political Affairs Council of the National Government has jurisdiction over the southwestern provinces. (Article 3) The Southwest Political Affairs Council may, with the resolution of the Political Affairs Conference, increase or abolish various agencies. (Article 4) The Southwest Political Affairs Council is composed of 15 to 27 members, specially appointed, and designates 5 to 7 members as standing committee members. (Article 5) The Southwest Political Affairs Council of the National Government establishes a secretariat, with one secretary-general, specially appointed; 5 to 7 secretaries, specially appointed or recommended; 2 to 5 section chiefs, recommended; and several section clerks, appointed. (Article 6) The Political Affairs Council establishes an audit office, with one director, specially appointed; 5 to 7 auditors, specially appointed or recommended; 8 to 12 assistant auditors, 6 to 10 investigators, recommended; 16 to 20 clerks, 9 to 12 scribes, appointed. (Article 7) The Southwest Political Affairs Council of the National Government may establish 9 to 12 specialized committee members, specially appointed or recommended. (Article 8) The Political Affairs Council holds a political affairs meeting once a week, with standing committee members taking turns as chairmen. (Article 9) The following matters shall be resolved by the Political Affairs Conference: (1) Appointment and dismissal of administrative, judicial, and auditing officials above the level of recommended appointment; (2) Matters that cannot be resolved between provinces; (3) Matters concerning budgets and final accounts; (4) Other matters deemed by laws and regulations or the standing committee members to be submitted for resolution. (Article 10) The Political Affairs Council may issue orders and single-line rules within the scope of its jurisdiction, without conflicting with central laws and regulations. (Article 11) Resolutions of the Political Affairs Council shall be submitted to the National Government for review and sent to the Executive Yuan or Control Yuan for record. (Article 12) If a dispute arises between the Political Affairs Council and the central yuan [Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination, Control] or ministries in terms of authority, it shall be submitted to the National Government for resolution. (Article 13) The Secretary and the Director of the Audit Office may attend the political affairs meetings of this committee. (Article 14) The rules of procedure for the political affairs meetings of this committee and the organizational regulations of the Secretariat and Audit Office shall be determined separately.

<h3 id="e72">Sun Lianzhong's Troops Withdraw to Western Fujian <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Northwest Army's Sun Lianzhong's troops, consisting of nine regiments, totaling approximately 15,000 soldiers, are complete with five branches of the military: infantry, artillery, cavalry, and engineers. They also have a great sword unit of 1,500 men and 1,200 cavalry horses. Last year, they were ordered to enter Jiangxi to suppress bandits and then garrisoned the Fuzhou and Eastern Jiangxi areas. In the past three months, the central government's supplies have been insufficient, so the division has been raising funds locally. During the New Year, they moved from Fuzhou to Shicheng and Ruijin, and on the 6th, they all arrived in Changting City, seeking food in various counties in Western Fujian. Because the division moved freely into Fujian, there has been considerable suspicion from the outside world. Yesterday, Zhong Guanxun, deputy commander of the newly formed 1st Independent Brigade in Wuping County, Fujian Province, came to Shantou to request the allocation of bullets and the provision of salaries to strengthen the Fujian-Guangdong border defense. After arriving in Shantou, Zhong stayed at the Jintai Inn on Wan'an Street. The reporter made a special trip to interview him about the recent situation on the Fujian border. According to him, last month, the Red bandits led by Peng Dehuai and others sneaked into Yunmenling and disturbed Guikeng, Dayangqiao, and Shanghang Fengshi in Wuping. The brigade launched an attack and fought fiercely in Guikeng for half a day, capturing more than 100 guns and four light machine guns. After this setback, the bandits dared not invade again. On the 28th of last month, the Red bandits in Changting invaded Guanzhuang in Shanghang, and were also defeated by Zhong Guanxun's troops, killing more than 100 bandits. Changting is currently garrisoned by Sun Lianzhong's troops, whose attitude is unclear. They have approximately 17,000 to 18,000 soldiers. They do not fly any flags and do not indicate whether they are surrendering to the Reds or resisting the Reds. In Changting, they only care about raising funds and do not take any action. However, the Western Fujian gentry have posted many welcome slogans for Sun's troops. The Lu Xinming Brigade, stationed in Liancheng and Qingliu, is withdrawing to the Yong'an and Shaxian areas in Northern Fujian. At present, the defense of Western Fujian is very serious. Zhong came here specifically to report to Commander Zhang in Shantou to request the provision of military supplies. It is understood that the commander of the newly formed 1st Independent Brigade, Zhong Shaokui, concurrently serves as the commander of the 1st Regiment, the deputy commander Zhong Guanxun, concurrently serves as the commander of the 2nd Regiment, Huang Pinmei is the commander of the 3rd Regiment, and Zhong Wencai is the commander of the 4th Regiment. The brigade was originally reorganized from the Armed Self-Help Corps and the Fujian-Jiangxi Border People's Regiment. Today, it was heard that Zhong continued to receive a letter from Zhong Shaokui in Shanghang, stating that on the 4th, hundreds of Sun Lianzhong's troops invaded Xianghu in the northern district of Wuping. Zhong's troops immediately sent a team to block them. The battle was extremely fierce, and Sun's troops were finally defeated and retreated to the Changting border. This is believed to be caused by Sun's rebellious soldiers, but Sun Lianzhong's own attitude is indeed unclear. (January 13)</p>

<p>Another Major Robbery Case Near Yanmu: Yan Huiqing, a wine merchant in Zhang Ao Township, Yanmu County, is a man of modest means. A few days ago, a money shop in Nanxun hired a boat to send 5,000 yuan to Yan's house. The bandits learned of this. At 10:00 PM that night, more than ten bandits suddenly came, holding two long and short guns. After landing, the bandits went up to the house and into the house, beating Yan and his wife with guns, forcing them to ask where the silver was stored. Yan, suffering from severe injuries, could only tell them. The bandits broke open the silver box, and the 6,000 yuan inside was stolen.

Applications for permission to organize had been submitted to the provincial party headquarters, but no certificate had been issued. Recently, representatives of the county chambers of commerce discussed the business tax issue in Zhenjiang and submitted a further request to the provincial party headquarters, with representatives also going to inquire. It is now reported that the provincial party headquarters held a meeting on the afternoon of the 20th and decided to approve the organization, provided that it complies with the Commercial Association Law and obtains the consent of more than two-thirds of the chambers of commerce in the province.

<p>County government joint trial of five kidnappers: Six bandits, Xing Youyi, Cao Jinbiao, Pan Guoliang, Yang Kunshan, Dong San, and Yin Dekui, kidnapped Yao Qibao, a partner in the Shuntai South Goods Store, and Wang Jiansan, the owner of the Xinchang Rice Store, in the Xin'an Town of the 13th district of this county. After being apprehended by the water patrol team of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, except for Yin Dekui, who was left in Shanghai for medical treatment due to injury, the remaining five bandits were escorted back to Wuxi by the local Public Security Bureau and handed over to the county government for detention and interrogation. Yesterday morning, County Chief Chen instructed Du Youlin of the political police to go to the countryside to summon the victims Yao Qibao and Wang Jiansan to identify the criminals. In the afternoon, County Chief Chen and Section Chief Wang held a joint trial. First, the victims Yao Qibao and Wang Jiansan were interrogated, followed by the five kidnappers, Xing Youyi, etc. However, Xing and the others gave slippery confessions and refused to tell the truth. Yao and Wang were then ordered to identify the suspects in court, confirming that they were the perpetrators. One of the kidnappers, Dong San, was identified as the one who disguised himself as a beggar and went to Xinchang Rice Store to negotiate the ransom. After the interrogation, Yao and Wang were ordered to return, and Xing Youyi and the others were returned to custody pending legal proceedings. During the trial, Yao Qibao also claimed that there were more than ten kidnappers in total, with four "box piers" (likely meaning firearms). They had previously engaged in two shootouts with police officers in Taihu Lake, seized a fishing boat, shot and killed the boat owner, and dumped the body in the lake before hiding the hostages. The fishing boat has been seized by the Suzhou Public Security Bureau, and the boat owner's wife is being held in Suzhou, can the county chief be requested to send an official letter to Suzhou to release her? Chen County Chief immediately said that this case would be handled separately, and that Yao could present the reason and submit it to the county for review. Yao Qibao then left the county and returned home.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Wang Jingwei goes to Beijing yesterday <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Wang boarded the train at Zhenru</p>
<p>Issues a statement of responsibility before leaving</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai the night before, Mr. Wang Jingwei originally planned to travel to Beijing in the same train as Sun Ke that night. However, due to his recent recovery from illness and the fatigue of the journey, he rested in Shanghai for one night. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., Mr. Wang returned to the Luo'er Hospital for an injection by Dr. Luo'er. He returned to his residence around 11 a.m., and Chu Minyi notified the railway bureau to prepare a train to go to Beijing at 3:15 p.m. The railway bureau prepared two special carriages to be attached to the first express train and waited at the station. At 2:18 p.m. yesterday afternoon, Mr. Chu arrived at the station first. At 3:15 p.m., when the train was about to depart, Mr. Wang had not yet arrived at the North Station. The railway bureau then received a phone call from Mr. Wang's residence, informing them that Mr. and Mrs. Wang, along with Tang Haian, had taken a car to Zhenru Station and asked the train to stop briefly at Zhenru for them to board. At 3:30 p.m., the train arrived at Zhenru, stopped briefly for one minute, and Mr. and Mrs. Wang and Tang Haian boarded the last special carriage to go to Beijing. Chen Xinghan, a special commissioner from the Ministry of Railways, accompanied the train to take care of everything.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Wang made a statement saying: (Question) Mr. Wang, what are your thoughts on meeting Mr. Chiang Kai-shek in Hangzhou? (Answer) I have not seen Mr. Chiang for several years. Although Mr. Chiang came to Shanghai several times last winter on October 21 to meet with representatives from Guangdong, due to time constraints, we did not have a detailed discussion. This time in Hangzhou, I was able to have a long meeting with Mr. Chiang. I deeply admire Mr. Chiang's sincerity and determination to unite and jointly face the national crisis. (Question) What are your thoughts on Mr. Hu Hanmin's reply telegram? (Answer) I agree with half of Mr. Hu's reply telegram and disagree with the other half. The First Plenary Session of the Central Committee decided that all Central Committee members should participate in the political conference, with Mr. Chiang, Mr. Hu, and myself as standing committee members. The responsibility of the standing committee members is to take turns chairing the meetings, and there are no other special tasks. Therefore, if the standing committee members are not in Beijing, the meeting can elect someone to be temporary chairman, as has been done before. Therefore, to say that the political conference cannot proceed without the three standing committee members is an overstatement. On this point, I share the same feeling as Mr. Hu. However, all comrades in the party are currently encouraging each other to unite sincerely and jointly face the national crisis. Therefore, considering the past rifts and striving for the present, Mr. Chiang, Mr. Hu, and myself must gather in the capital and work together to save the country. To say that we fear disagreements that would embarrass the government, and therefore should be in different places, would only make such disagreements more likely to occur. How about each of us contributing our opinions to the political conference and letting the majority decide, so that we can truly implement democracy and centralized power? This is why I cannot fully agree with Mr. Hu's reply telegram. (Question) To what extent can you do your best in Beijing this time? (Answer) I will participate in the political conference as a member of the Central Committee. In other words, I will do my best in whatever way a member of the Central Committee can. However, as my health has not fully recovered, I have agreed with my comrades that I can only attend meetings on important issues, and all other meetings, receptions, speeches, and social events will be temporarily omitted. This has been understood and agreed to by my comrades.</p>

<p>Minister Huang has returned to the ministry to resume his duties</p>
<p>Mr. Lin agrees to make a short-term effort</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Minister of Finance Huang Hanliang has returned to the ministry to work and officially resumed his duties. He immediately sent a telegram to Executive Vice Minister Lin Kanghou, urging him to take office to stabilize the market and reassure the people. At the same time, members of the banking community, upon hearing the news, also urged Mr. Lin to go to Beijing to take office. It is reported that Vice Minister Lin telegraphed Minister Huang yesterday, agreeing to make a short-term effort, and sent a telegram to President of the Executive Yuan Sun Zhesheng, which read: "To President Sun of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Kanghou previously requested that the National Government review and revoke the order appointing me as Executive Vice Minister of Finance, allowing me to retreat and avoid embarrassing myself, as I felt I was unable to assist in the ministry's affairs. This was from the sincerity and not an excuse. However, this was not approved, and I was repeatedly urged to stay. Although I dare not change my original intention, I must make a short-term effort to stabilize the market and because it is the end of the year. I still hope that you will understand my true feelings and submit another request, recommending a replacement, so as to achieve the effect of selecting talented people for government. Kanghou, in the private sector, will still contribute his wisdom for the benefit of the country and the people. I respectfully present this to you, hoping you will consider it. Lin Kanghou kowtows, Ma."</p>

<p>Japanese Consulate Expresses Regret to the Chinese Concession Authorities</p>
<p>Various Public Organizations Issue Statements Yesterday</p>
<p>Following the attempted arson by Japanese ruffians on the Sanyou Industrial Company's main factory the day before yesterday, resulting in the death of one Chinese constable and injuries to three others (details were reported in yesterday's newspaper), it has been learned that yesterday remained uneventful throughout the day. However, the Chinese Concession police authorities remained on high alert. The Japanese Consul expressed regret and apologized to the Chinese Concession authorities yesterday. A summary of the situation yesterday is as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Expresses Regret: After the incident of the Japanese riot on the previous day, Mayor Wu Tiecheng sent Secretary-General Yu to the Japanese Consulate at 3 PM to lodge a serious verbal protest, demanding a guarantee that such incidents would not recur, that the perpetrators would be severely apprehended, and reserving all rights to further negotiations. When Secretary-General Yu lodged the protest, Japanese Consul-General Murai Aoyoshi immediately acknowledged the extreme illegality of the Japanese ruffians' actions, expressed his deepest regret, and promised to severely apprehend the perpetrators. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, Consul-General Murai visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government, personally expressing his regret. He also requested Mayor Wu to severely apprehend the culprits regarding the incident a few days prior in which five Japanese monks were attacked on Ma Yu Mountain Road. Mayor Wu also expressed his agreement.</p>
<p>Concession Lodges Representations: During the riot by Japanese ruffians the previous morning, one Chinese constable was killed and two were wounded. In the afternoon of the same day, several Western constables were also injured in Hongkou. Following this incident, the Shanghai Municipal Council convened a board meeting at 4 PM to include the matter on the agenda. Consequently, the board deemed the lawlessness of the Japanese ruffians unimaginable concerning the Concession's security and decided that serious representations should be made to the Japanese Consulate regarding the injured and deceased police officers. Therefore, Secretary-General Fessenden was instructed to make serious representations to the Japanese Consulate. The Japanese board members present also expressed their unease and agreed to request the Japanese Consulate to strictly restrain the violent acts of the Japanese ruffians.</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Formally Apologizes: Following the serious representations made by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Japanese Consulate, led by Consul-General Murai, personally visited the Council yesterday afternoon to meet with Chairman Macnaghten and formally apologized for the previous day's incident. However, it is reported that the Council has not yet fully completed all negotiations and that no proposals have been made regarding compensation for the injured and deceased Chinese constables.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Yu Speaks: Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government told a Huadong News Agency reporter yesterday that the cause of the Japanese ruffians' riot the previous morning was actually quite trivial. Several days ago, five Japanese monks were traveling through the Yinxiang Port area when they had a conflict with Chinese people, resulting in injuries. The Japanese Consulate had already approached the Municipal Government about this matter, and he had immediately agreed to apprehend and punish the culprits for the Chinese assault on the Japanese people, as the incident occurred within the Chinese territory. He also expressed his regret. However, the Japanese ruffians went so far as to kill and injure Chinese constables in the Concession and burn down the Sanyou Factory. The illegality of their actions was clearly evident. Therefore, when he protested to the Japanese Consul the previous day, he had stated that the assault on the Japanese monks and the riot were entirely separate matters, differing greatly in severity. The Municipal Government had agreed to apprehend and punish the culprits for the assault on the Japanese monks. He wondered how Japanese law would punish the riot by the Japanese ruffians. The Japanese Consul then expressed his deepest regret and personally visited the Municipal Government today to express his regret to Mayor Wu and promised to apprehend and severely punish the culprits. However, the Municipal Government has not yet submitted a formal written protest on this matter, but it is expected to be formally submitted to the Japanese Consulate tomorrow. As for the Concession authorities, he had met with Fessenden, who expressed the hope that this matter would not escalate and cause other unfortunate incidents. He did not know how negotiations would proceed.</p>
<p>Fessenden Speaks: A reporter from this newspaper visited Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, yesterday to inquire about the Council's attitude toward the Japanese ruffians' violent acts. Fessenden replied that the Council would make representations to the Japanese Consul-General, but a resolution could not be reached in a day or two. Fessenden also said that China and Japan were practically at war and that the public's emotions were inevitably激昂激昂. The Council's responsibility was to maintain the Concession's security to the best of its ability, without taking sides. He hoped that citizens would not overreact.</p>
<p>Japanese Vice-Consul Speaks: Japanese Vice-Consul Shirai Yasushi told a Huadong News Agency reporter yesterday that two major unfortunate incidents occurred in this city the day before yesterday: one was the arson by Japanese in Hudong, burning down the Sanyou Factory, and the other was the riot and disturbance caused by Japanese on North Sichuan Road. The consulate is currently investigating the perpetrators of the incidents. Several suspects have already turned themselves in, but the names are not yet ready to be released. The consular authorities believe that the actions of the Japanese residents this time were illegal and should be seriously investigated. However, the arson at the Sanyou Factory was an act of revenge. On the 18th of this month, five Japanese monks, two in monk's robes and three in plain clothes, believed that as Buddhist monks, they would not be attacked by Chinese people. Unexpectedly, when passing near the factory, they were grabbed and beaten by workers from the factory (Huadong News Agency reporter's note: Investigations at the Sanyou Factory and the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District revealed that the factory workers were completely unrelated to the incident). Two managed to escape during the confusion, while three were severely injured and remain hospitalized. It is reported that one of the injured is in critical condition. Following this incident, the Japanese residents of Shanghai were greatly angered, leading to this incident. In fact, even if the Japanese residents suffered losses, they should have appealed to the Japanese Consul to negotiate with the Municipal Government and should not have resorted to such barbaric means, causing this unfortunate incident. Consul Murai has already expressed his regret to the Municipal Government today. As for the culprits, they are being thoroughly investigated. Once apprehended, they will be severely punished. However, the consulate is concerned that relations between Chinese and Japanese residents in Shanghai have deteriorated recently, and the atmosphere is very tense. Therefore, they have decided to cable the government, requesting that warships be sent to Shanghai as a precaution.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Reports to the Municipal Government: The Public Security Bureau submitted an unofficial report to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating that at 2 AM on the 20th, the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District received a report that a fire had broken out at the Sanyou Industrial Company factory in Yinxiang Port. Wu Yuting, chief of the Fourth Precinct, immediately led police officers to the scene to provide assistance. The Yangshupu Fire Brigade also arrived to pump water and extinguish the fire, which was quickly put out, and they returned. Unexpectedly, shortly after, they heard news of another fire, suspecting a recurrence of the blaze, which was quite strange and difficult to understand. They went to the factory to investigate and found traces of damage to the fence. Upon entering, they saw that the small windows on all sides had been burned by fire, and liquor bottles were still present. They also found a large bottle with a label that read "High-Grade Beverage" (Xin Sheng News Agency reporter's note: "High-Grade Beverage" is a Japanese term, and the bottle is also a Japanese product), as well as packets of gunpowder. The factory's losses include six destroyed buildings and twenty-four damaged machines, resulting in twenty-four workers being unable to work the next day (i.e., yesterday).</p>
<p>Chen Constable's Condition Critical: One Chinese constable was stabbed to death by Japanese people the day before yesterday, and three other injured constables were sent to the hospital for treatment. It was reported yesterday that the most seriously injured was Chen Shengde, Constable No. 3029. Chen, a native of Anhui, 27 years old, is still unable to speak. Due to the force of the stabbing, his waist injury resulted in a severed intestine, and his left cheek was injured by gunpowder, causing him to lose a front tooth. According to visitors to the hospital, his abdomen has been operated on, but he remains unconscious. Furthermore, he lost too much blood after the incident, and his life is in danger.</p>
<p>Preparations to Commemorate Constable Tian: The Cotton Weaving Industry Union of the Seventh District, the Eleventh Branch of the Seventh District, and other organizations are deeply saddened by the arson committed by Japanese people at the Sanyou Industrial Company factory and the shooting death of Municipal Council Chinese Constable Tian Runsheng, who bravely struggled to protect the factory. Yesterday, they initiated the organization of a memorial preparatory committee to console his spirit and published a notice seeking enthusiastic participation from various organizations. The contact address is No. 24 Shenjiazhai, Yinxiang Port.</p>
<p>Four Suspects Detained: Following the arson committed by Japanese people at the Sanyou Factory, all employees have been paying closer attention to their own protection. The factory has also issued a notice for security reasons that unauthorized individuals or idlers are strictly prohibited from entering. Unexpectedly, at noon, four people wearing short-sleeved clothing and resembling workers entered the factory to look around. Initially, the factory thought they were workers and paid no attention. However, their incessant questions aroused suspicion, and they were immediately detained. After questioning, Zhou Huisheng and Huishengbao were sent to the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District, while Xie Quan and Hui A'er are currently being interrogated in detail by the factory. It has been learned that Xie is a 21-year-old native of Jiangyin and a worker at Jardine Matheson, while Hui is also a native of Jiangyin and previously worked as a streetcar ticket seller. The four were traveling together out of curiosity and had no malicious intentions. After questioning, they were all sent to the Public Security Precinct.</p>
<p>Police Kiosk and Factory Repaired: The glass windows surrounding Police Kiosk No. 1 of the Yangshupu police station were completely destroyed by Japanese ruffians the previous morning. Yesterday, the kiosk was repaired by artisans dispatched by the police station, and the number of stationed patrol officers was larger than usual, approximately a dozen or more, including Chinese, Western, and Indian officers, with very tight security. As for all the damage to the Sanyou main factory, such as the fences and factory buildings, it was also completely repaired yesterday. A large number of public security police officers were stationed in front of the gate, and a temporary observation platform was set up in front of the dyeing room at the back of the factory to prepare for any unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>Japanese Marines Demonstrate: Near the Tianneng'an Station intersection of Tongji Road, at approximately 1:50 PM yesterday, five Japanese Marines, fully armed with rifles and ammunition, demonstrated in the area on motorcycles. The vehicles also carried portable machine guns, creating a very serious situation. Similarly, on Yokohama Road, at around 5 PM, three soldiers initially appeared, scouted around, and left. They were followed by another twenty or more, patrolling and demonstrating. Sentries were stationed outside the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters on Dixiwei Road, with very strict precautions.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships to Arrive in Shanghai: After this incident, the Japanese residents convened a meeting the day before yesterday and once petitioned the Japanese Consulate, also cabling the Japanese naval authorities, requesting that warships be sent to Shanghai to demonstrate. It has been learned that the Japanese side has dispatched the aircraft carrier Notoro, the cruiser Oi, and four small destroyers from the Wu Naval Port, carrying several Marines, which are en route to Shanghai and are expected to arrive here tomorrow morning. It is also learned that there are currently two Japanese warships in Shanghai: the flagship Atago and the destroyer Kamikaze. After these six ships arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, there will be a total of eight ships anchored in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents to Meet Tomorrow: According to the Great American Evening Post, the Japanese residents will hold a meeting at the Japanese Club on Peng Road on Saturday morning (i.e., the 23rd) to discuss the issue of what actions the residents should take if the Japanese Consul and naval commander do not take aggressive measures against China.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce's Petition: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce petitioned the Municipal Government, stating that it was petitioning regarding a matter. The Chamber learned on the 20th of this month that Japanese ruffians had set fire to the Sanyou Industrial Company's main factory and recognized that this matter concerned the safety and security of the city's commercial affairs and was very serious. It immediately sent personnel to investigate to clarify the truth and seek a resolution. According to the investigators' report, they visited the factory and spoke with Deputy Factory Director Lao, who was not present. Wang Keqiang, an employee, received them and described the incident, which was consistent with what was reported in the newspapers on the 21st. Wang then led them to visit the damaged weaving factory, which was covered in charred wood and suffered severe losses. They then went to the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District to investigate, and it was reported that evidence of the Japanese arson had been collected, including beer bottles, Japanese newspapers, and bomb fragments, which were submitted to higher authorities for review. Although the arson by Japanese ruffians at the factory was contained due to thorough temporary precautions and effective firefighting, preventing the entire factory from being burned, the Japanese's malicious plan was thwarted, but their ambition remains undeterred. It is inevitable that they will use even more vicious means against the factory in the future. Although the factory is operating normally, the workers are anxious.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>They cannot live in peace. Measures should be taken to properly protect the factory against unforeseen circumstances, and protests should be lodged with the Japanese Consul, demanding serious negotiations. The factory's location and the route taken by the Japanese ruffians for arson are indicated on the attached simplified map (map omitted), which is submitted for your review. Violent acts by Japanese ruffians in Shanghai are not new, and it has never been heard that the relevant consul has strictly enforced the law and punished them severely. Our government officials have repeatedly tolerated the situation and taken no action, leading to these individuals becoming even more reckless, resulting in the great misfortune of burning down factories and killing constables. Shanghai is an international city, the focus of global attention, and they still act without any regard, and their violent acts are escalating. The future crisis facing the factory is truly alarming. Given the lessons learned from previous incidents and the factory's remote location and the attention its successful operations have drawn from the Japanese, it is not comparable to ordinary shops and should be strictly prepared. The Municipal Government should consult with military agencies and instruct the Public Security Bureau to dispatch military police to guard the key points around the factory and make serious representations to the Japanese Consul, demanding severe punishment for the culprits and compensation for the losses. The recent cases in Fuzhou and Guangzhou can serve as precedents. No excuses or evasions should be tolerated. A brief map is attached for your perusal and approval. It is in the public interest. Sincerely, The Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Taxpayer Association's Telegram and Letter: The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association sent out two telegrams and one official letter yesterday, as follows: ⑴ Telegram to the Executive Yuan, addressed to President Sun of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing. "At 2:30 AM on the 20th of this month, violent Japanese residents set fire to the Sanyou Industrial Company factory and boldly resisted the suppression of the Shanghai First Special District Municipal Council police, killing one police officer and seriously injuring two others. Furthermore, on the same afternoon, they gathered hundreds of people and vandalized shops on North Sichuan Road and Laobazi Road. The entire city is shocked, and the public's outrage is indescribable. We believe that the violent Japanese are planning to create a serious situation in various places to divide our nation's public sentiment. If the central government does not sever diplomatic relations with the violent Japanese or adopt further measures, the people will be helpless and unable to take active measures to cope. We urgently request that you devise a method to dispatch effective police forces to assist the Municipal Council in maintaining security. This urgent telegram is submitted for your consideration. Sincerely, The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association, Ma (seal)." ⑵ Telegram to the Municipal Government, addressed to Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government. "Violent Japanese residents set fire to the Sanyou Industrial Company factory, killing and injuring multiple police officers of the First Special District Municipal Council. Furthermore, they gathered hundreds of people on North Sichuan Road and Bazi Road and vandalized shops. This serious situation is already clear to you, Mayor. The district has a population of millions, with Chinese people accounting for over 950,000, and our interests are even more closely intertwined. The Municipal Council's police force in the district seems insufficient to maintain security. We specially request that you, Mayor, consider dispatching effective police forces to assist the bureau in maintaining security so that the lives and property of the district's residents can be protected. We anxiously await your response. Sincerely, The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association, Ma (seal)." ⑶ Letter to the Municipal Council. "We are writing to inform you that, according to reports, at 2:30 AM on the 20th of this month, violent Japanese residents set fire to the Sanyou Industrial Company factory and boldly resisted the suppression of your bureau's police, killing one police officer and seriously injuring two others. Furthermore, at 3 PM on the same afternoon, they gathered hundreds of people and vandalized shops on North Sichuan Road and Laobazi Road. Our association is filled with indignation. The violent Japanese regime's treatment of the Korean people under its rule, wantonly killing thousands of our country's residents in that area without taking responsibility, has already disqualified it as a modern nation. Starting on September 18th of last year, they deliberately fabricated incidents, violated international covenants, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and used military force to invade key areas of our country's Liaoning and Jilin provinces. Despite Japanese Envoy Yoshizawa's guarantees at international meetings not to expand military operations, they further occupied Heilongjiang, invaded Jinzhou, and eyed Rehe, seized the Beining Railway, and disregarded the interests of other countries. This kind of barbaric and inhumane behavior is even more unacceptable for a modern nation. Perhaps because the matter is in the Northeast, the various foreign residents residing in this district have not witnessed it firsthand and believe that the barbarity of the violent Japanese could not be so extreme. But what about now? Your bureau's police officers are wantonly killed and injured, and the security of the district is wantonly disrupted. Do they still have any regard for the existence of your bureau? Our association believes that your bureau is jointly owned by the residents of the district, and the violent Japanese's insult to your bureau and disruption of security is precisely an insult to the residents of this district and a disruption of their security. How can the residents of this district stand by and do nothing? We originally thought that your bureau must have the ability to maintain security or would not need external assistance. We are corresponding with your bureau to request that you strengthen your police force to maintain security and hope to receive a prompt reply to address the urgent situation."</p>
<p>Statements from Two Organizations: ⑴ Joint Declaration. "The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Citizens' Union issue a joint declaration regarding the violent Japanese residents. It has been verified that violent Japanese residents set fire to the Sanyou Industrial Company factory, killing and injuring multiple police officers of the First Special District Municipal Council and vandalizing countless shops on North Sichuan Road and Laobazi Road. This kind of barbaric behavior is a premeditated overall plan by the anti-modern-nation violent Japanese and is not merely an individual problem of the Sanyou Industrial Company, nor is it merely a matter of interests for the shops on North Sichuan Road and Laobazi Road, nor is it merely a question of the Municipal Council's ability to maintain security. It is actually a problem for all of Shanghai and all of China concerning Japan. Currently, the violent Japanese are not only at odds with the Chinese people but also with the foreign residents of all related countries. Under the current circumstances, the Municipal Council is a jointly owned Municipal Council of our country's residents and foreign residents. Now, the violent Japanese residents dare to obstruct the performance of public duties by the police officers of the Municipal Council, who are responsible for maintaining security, killing and injuring multiple people and disrupting security and vandalizing shops. It is as if they view the Municipal Council as something completely insignificant. Our association believes that this kind of behavior is due to our national government not severing diplomatic relations with the violent Japanese, resulting in the inability to exercise the rights of expulsion and sanctions. This should be reported to the government, and diplomatic relations with Japan should be severed immediately, and further measures should be implemented. Otherwise, if we only focus on minor details, we fear that the scope of their barbaric behavior will continue to expand without end. Looking at the case of the destruction of the Sanyou Factory, the Municipal Council seems to have the responsibility to maintain security, but unfortunately, the police force is insufficient and dare not confront their marines. We should devise a method to assist them. This should be requested of the government: that they dispatch effective military police to assist the Municipal Council in maintaining security. As for our residents, they should actively organize and unite and no longer be as disorganized as before, thinking that associations are useless. It must be understood that unity brings strength, while division brings weakness. To confront the violent Japanese residents, all the city's residents should unite. Our associations have been entrusted with great responsibility by the shops and residents, and we dare not lag behind in resisting Japan and saving the country. We especially hope that all the public organizations in Shanghai will unite as one, with the masses united like a fortress. Our association members vow to fight to the death and will not turn back. We issue this declaration for your public consideration. January 21st, Republic of China year 20." ⑵ Telegram to the Executive Yuan, addressed to President Sun of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing. "Yesterday morning at 2:30, violent Japanese residents set fire to the Sanyou Industrial Company factory, killing and injuring multiple police officers of the First Special District Municipal Council. At 3 PM, they vandalized countless shops on North Sichuan Road and Laobazi Road. People in both the commercial and industrial sectors are in danger, and every resident in the city is disheartened. If we do not immediately sever diplomatic relations with the violent Japanese and expel and sanction them, the harm will be even greater than severing diplomatic relations. What will happen later? Now, the violent Japanese have disregarded the police power of the Municipal Council, and its ability to maintain security will be greatly reduced. Shanghai has a total of three million residents, and their property is countless. This hub of Sino-foreign trade and economy should be preserved immediately. We specially request that, in addition to immediately severing diplomatic relations with Japan, effective military police should be dispatched to assist local military police and provide effective protection to ensure the safety of lives and property. We anxiously await your response. Sincerely, The United Federation of Shanghai Commercial Circles and the Shanghai Citizens' Union, Ma (seal)." ⑶ Telegram to the Municipal Government, addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Government. "The violent actions of the Japanese residents are presumably within your government's knowledge, and we will not elaborate further. Now, the violent Japanese are obstructing the exercise of police power by the First Special District Municipal Council and daring to kill and injure police officers. Shanghai's security is, of course, at risk. We specially request that the government consult with the First Special District police authorities to establish a joint defense and maintain security, and request that the government dispatch effective troops for protection. We anxiously await your instructions. Sincerely, The United Federation of Shanghai Commercial Circles and the Shanghai Citizens' Union, Ma (seal)."</p>
<p>Resolutions of the City Federation's Branch Meetings: The Seventeenth and Twenty-Fifth Branches of the Shanghai Special District City and People's Federation held a general membership meeting at the Sichuan Road YMCA at 2 PM yesterday, with over 500 attendees. Li Xingzhi, Wang Ren'e, and Gu Wensheng were elected as the presiding committee. First, Fan Muxian reported on the violent acts of the Japanese ruffians.

<h3 id="e86">Glimpses of the Hangzhou Conference <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Ye Zhuotang to Become Minister of Finance</p>
<p>Song Ziwen to Be Envoy to France</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Conference concluded after Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek agreed to enter Nanjing. According to participants in the secret talks who spoke to reporters, the focus of the Hangzhou Conference was on the issue of the three individuals, Wang, Chiang, and Hu, entering the central government. Although there were detailed discussions on other diplomatic, financial, and military matters, no concrete measures were reached. Everything remains to be finalized in Nanjing. After the issue of Wang and Chiang entering Nanjing was resolved, someone mentioned whether the Premier of the Executive Yuan would be replaced. Chiang stated that Sun Ke would continue to maintain the status quo. Although there were rumors that Song Ziwen might become Premier or return as Minister of Finance, they were later dismissed. It is said that Ye Zhuotang has been internally appointed to replace Huang Hanliang as Minister of Finance. It is also said that Song Ziwen's appointment as envoy to France may soon become a reality.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Zhang Taiyan and Others Request National Aid to Western Liaoning <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Binglin and others issued a circular telegram, stating, "To the public, although Guandong has been lost, righteous men still exist. Ma Zhanshan's defense of Hailun and the Western Liaoning Volunteer Army's recapture of Dahu Mountain are comparable to Liu Kun and Zu Ti, who are still admired. According to those who have come from Western Liaoning, the Volunteer Army is composed of scattered soldiers and militia groups, with women, the elderly, and the weak all serving as porters. When they win, they advance like riding horses, and when they lose, the entire family perishes together. The saying 'generals have the will to die, and soldiers have no desire to live' can be seen here. Therefore, they can defeat the cavalry and recover our lost territory. Although Zhu Guang's strategy is commendable, it is still evident that only one city or one brigade has strong men. If the entire country were like this, what would we fear from the enemy? However, the authorities have no will to fight and have not heard of a single soldier being sent to aid them. In the past, Helan Jinming was Zhang Xun's military governor, who was solely responsible. He did not go to the rescue because he was. Nan Jiyun still said he would destroy Helan. How do today's authorities view Helan? Therefore, we should rely on the government for matters of national survival, but if we cannot rely on it, the people must take responsibility themselves. Hailun is far in the extreme frontier, and there are still those who raise funds for it, even though the roads are difficult to reach. Western Liaoning is nearby, just outside the border, and there are routes for travel via the Rehe Sea. It is not like Hailun, which is extremely remote and difficult to reach. To abandon this rescue and空於絕代之下、思熊廷弼袁崇煥何爲乎、think of Xiong Tingbi and Yuan Chonghuan, what were they for? You should know that the Liaoning Province is our former territory. Not to mention the Qin and Han dynasties, the Ming Dynasty established the Liaodong Military Command, which shielded Beijing and was the most important town. To say that this is not our land is ignorant and absurd, and does not look at history. In particular, the southwest corner is closely related to the interests of northern Hebei. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Shenyang and Guangning fell one after another. However, the Qing army was ultimately unable to enter directly through Shanhaiguan because the four cities outside the pass resisted them. If this place is lost, Yan and Ji will become the extreme frontier. If you want to ensure that everything north of the Yellow River will always be part of China, I am afraid that no one will dare to guarantee it. Binglin and others fear that You and Ji will become sad cities and that the righteous people will not be rescued. Therefore, we urgently present these words and urge all the wise and brave men of the country to rise up and plan together. Zhang Binglin, Zhang Yizhen, Wen Zongyao, Zhao Hengti, Peng Yunyi, Shen Junru, Li Genyuan, Zhao Zhengping, and others."</p>

<p>The Guild Decides on Measures to Deal with Unscrupulous Merchants</p>
<p>The coal industry in this city, after being shut down due to the Yongchang Coal Company's undermining of the patriotic movement, has fully resumed operations after all sectors fought for sovereignty because the Municipal Council overstepped its authority in arresting the inspector. Inspector Yan Bin has been found not guilty and released on bail by the court. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Full Resumption of Operations by Over 1,800 Coal Businesses: With Inspector Yan Bin found not guilty by the Special District Local Court and released on bail during the appeal period, the coal businesses have fully resumed operations since yesterday, following the orders of the Coal Merchants' Association. The coal market on Zhejiang Road also resumed business yesterday. The firewood and charcoal industries that provide support, as well as the coal barge transportation industry, also announced the resumption of coal barging operations from yesterday. However, due to the two-day shutdown, yesterday was quite busy for the various coal businesses.</p>
<p>Measures to Deal with the Situation: A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Mao Chun, a standing committee member of the Coal Industry Association, yesterday to inquire about the measures to deal with the unscrupulous Yongchang Coal Company. According to Mao, Yongchang Coal Company's private import of Japanese coal and undermining of the patriotic movement had been resolved by a general meeting of members to permanently expel Wu Yongchang, the owner of Yongchang Coal Company, from the association. The ten tons and one [unit of weight] of Matsuura coal seized by the inspector are currently temporarily stored at the Yi Tai Hing Western Warehouse, awaiting the court's legal disposition. As for Yongchang Coal Company's debt of over ten thousand taels to more than ten companies including Yi Tai Hing and Yuan Feng, which was deliberately defaulted on with dishonored checks, the industry association has jointly filed a criminal lawsuit.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Grocery Association has been established for two months, and its achievements are remarkable. For example, the work of organizing the market prices of the industry and requesting the government to reduce taxes has been implemented one by one. Recently, it was learned that the association believes that the grocery business involves a wide variety of products, and it is inevitable that there will be accidental seizures in the middle. Therefore, it has drafted draft documents such as a "Certificate to Ensure No Japanese Goods" and "Measures for Using the Certificate to Ensure No Japanese Goods," as well as a "Statement of Voluntary Agreement Not to Buy or Sell Japanese Goods" for certification purposes, to prove that the goods packed in the boxes or packages contain no Japanese goods. It has already separately obtained approval from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for record. The inspection is easy to recognize, and the transportation is convenient. Yesterday, the association sent letters to various local anti-Japanese associations to inform them for reference and implement the use of the certificate immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Li Jingcong Discusses the Northwest Trial Flight <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Preparation Process · · · Trial Flight Situation</p>
<p>This time, Eurasia Aviation Corporation, undeterred by dangers and difficulties, conducted the only long-distance Northwest trial flight in the world, and safely flew back to Shanghai on the 13th of this month. Although newspapers have competed to publish news about this great success, they have all been brief and lacking in detail. The Daily News reporter, recognizing that the Northwest is in the same position as the Northeast, and that the Northeast is already in a critical situation, believes that the Northwest's transportation and all other aspects cannot be ignored any longer. Therefore, yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Li Jingcong, who led the flight to the Northwest, at the company to make a more detailed inquiry. Mr. Li was kind enough to tell everything he knew. It is disclosed here urgently, which I believe will be welcomed by those who are concerned about national affairs. The following is Mr. Li's account:</p>
<p>Preparation Process: Last autumn, Wang Boqun, the Minister of Transportation, believing that the situation in the interior and remote areas was too isolated and the flow of information was too obstructed, which had too far-reaching effects on national defense, culture, politics, and industry, etc., ordered Eurasia Aviation Corporation to actively prepare for the Northwest route. The company, also believing that this route was being watched by the government and hoped for by the people, and that the Shanghai-Chongqing line was affected by the violent Japanese and could not fly as planned, decided to prepare for the trial flight despite the hardships. In October last year, the two general managers sent me (Li's self-reference) and Schmidt to Beiping to carry out the preparations. The main points of the preparation were: first, the selection of the route. Based on geography and climate, we originally planned to take a route from Shanghai to Beijing, through Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, directly into Xinjiang, completely flying over the hinterland of the commercially prosperous area. Later, due to the prevalence of bandits in Gansu and the inability to transport gasoline, we changed to the current route that has been successfully test-flown, from Shanghai to Beijing, Shandong, through Beiping, Guihua, Ruoshui River, directly into Xinjiang. This route mostly flies over high mountains and ridges, vast deserts and wilderness, with no human habitation and a very bad climate. Second, the transportation and storage of gasoline. Since we had decided to use the desert route, we had to urgently transport and store gasoline at Ruoshui River, the center point 2,600 kilometers long between Beiping and Dihua, so that the plane could refuel midway. Moreover, because it would take at least two months to transport from the interior to Ruoshui River, if we did not do so urgently, it would not be possible to test-fly at the end of December last year. However, inland merchants traveling between the interior and Xinjiang via Ruoshui River only knew how to follow a certain route to cross the river, and were completely unaware of the name of the river crossing location, the surrounding terrain, whether there were any targets that could be used for aerial observation, and landing sites for the aircraft. Therefore, we had to hire a Swedish man, Sheng Ruiheng, at a great cost, who was familiar with the local situation, to transport and store the gasoline for us. Sheng Ruiheng also drew a rough map of the upper reaches of the Ruoshui River, about forty kilometers from the Juyan Sea at the Fork River, which was suitable for aircraft landing and easy to use as an aerial observation target, and handed it to us. The gasoline was stored there. As for the gasoline used in Xinjiang Province, although the Ministry of Transportation telegraphed the Xinjiang Provincial Government to purchase it from Russia on its behalf, it was faster and cheaper than transporting it from the interior. Third, the preparation of equipment. Flying over mountains and ridges, vast deserts and wilderness, with no human habitation, and difficult to rescue, it is the only long-distance desert route in the world, and its equipment should be such that it is not easily damaged, is suitable for long-distance flight, and has considerable proof in the record. The aircraft used by the company at that time was the Junkers W33 all-metal aircraft and the Junkers L5 200-horsepower engine, which were suitable for all these conditions, and were supplemented with various additional equipment. Therefore, it was able to fly about 20,000 [units of distance] back and forth without repair or inspection, and without any failures. As for personnel, in addition to reporting to the Ministry of Transportation and forwarding a telegram to Chairman Jin in Dihua to seek his consent in advance, we also asked the relevant authorities in Suiyuan and Ningxia Provinces to issue a circular to the military police and league banners along the route to assist in protection. In terms of publicity, we also earnestly requested the Ministry of Transportation to consult the relevant agencies to ask them to hand over the official documents sent to Xinjiang to the company to carry with them, and also sent a letter to the General Post Office to ask them to select some of the mail sent from Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, and other areas to Xinjiang and hand it over to the company to carry for free. In addition, we also carried free of charge various major newspapers in Shanghai and Pingjin, as well as the Northwest Trial Flight Special Issue printed by the China Weekly and the China Weekly Society. The above is about the outline of the preparation process.</p>
<p>Trial Flight Situation: The Northwest route has been described above, and it takes the route from Shanghai via Nanjing, Jinan, Beiping, Guihua, Ruoshui River, Hami, Dihua, to Weitangzi near Tacheng on the Sino-Russian border. The entire route is divided into three sections of flight: the first section is Shanghai to Beiping, the second section is Beiping to Ruoshui River, and the third section is Ruoshui River to Weitangzi. Each section requires one day's journey. Except for the first section, which is the inevitable route of the company's Shanghai-Manchuria line, there are no high mountains or ridges in terms of geography, there are few sudden changes in terms of climate, there are parallel railways in terms of transportation, and rescue is possible everywhere. Since it was opened last year, there has never been an accident, so it is not necessary to carry out another test flight. However, in order to confirm that the news between Shanghai and Xinjiang can be reached in the shortest time, I led the flight on December 13 last year, carrying mail and news from Shanghai to Xinjiang, such as the Shen Bao, the Xin Wen Bao, the China Weekly, and the Northwest Trial Flight Special Issue printed by the newspaper, and set off north. We passed through Nanjing, because we had to report the trip to the Ministry of Transportation and carry documents from various agencies to the Xinjiang Provincial Government, and stayed for half a day. We continued to fly to Beiping early on the 14th, in order to proceed west on the 15th according to the original plan. Later, we received a telegram from Chairman Jin in Dihua, telling us that the gasoline had not yet arrived, and asking us to postpone the trip. We had to change our plan and take off from Pingjin at 7:00 am on the 20th, carrying mail and news from Pingjin to Xinjiang, and arrived at Guihua at 9:50 am via Zhangjiakou Pingdiquan. We continued to move forward at 11:00 am, passed Baotou, crossed Wolf Mountain, and arrived at Ruoshui River at 4:30 pm. It is estimated that this section (the second section) from Beiping to Wolf Mountain, a part of it follows the Ping-Sui Railway, and a part of it is flying along the old course of the Yellow River. Although the conditions for safe flight are not as good as the Shanghai-Ping section, there are still ways to think of in case of failure. From Wolf Mountain to Ruoshui River in the west, there are about eight or nine hundred [units of distance]. Except for the winding camel road, there are two or three Mongolian yurts and a water well every tens of [units of distance], which are not suitable for straight-line aerial flight, and the rest are high mountains and ridges, towering peaks, vast wilderness, boundless, no water, no grass, and no traces of life. When arriving, there are unpredictable climate changes. Under these circumstances, without extremely skilled technicians and extremely solid aircraft parts, it is easy to happen if one engages in exploration. If something happens, it will not only be difficult to replenish and rescue, but it will also take a lot of time, and it will inevitably become a dried carp. When the plane arrived at the Ruoshui River at 4:30 pm, it immediately searched for the gasoline storage location according to the map drawn by Sheng Ruiheng. However, although there is flat ground in the coastal area, it is interspersed with sand mountains, and Mongolian yurts are mixed in the bushes. In addition to being able to fly over it and look down by chance, it is extremely difficult to find by looking sideways. In addition, there are no other cities, villages, or special buildings that can be used as targets. As a result, the gasoline deposit location could not be found after circling in the air for a while and a half. Moreover, as it was getting late and the weather was getting colder, we had to land in the deserted suburbs of an ancient city about eighty or ninety kilometers from the Juyan Sea that we had discovered. The weather became even colder at night, and the thermometer dropped to thirty-one degrees below zero. We all lay on top of each other in the plane, like sardines placed in a tin can. According to the investigation, the city is Heichengzi, built in the Han Dynasty. Marco Polo used to pass through it twice from Rome to China. Later, it was submerged by sandstorms due to strong climate changes. Now, except for the city walls and streets that can still be clearly distinguished when viewed from the air, the traces of life have long since disappeared. We believe that the fuel in the plane is only enough for one hour of use, and we are deeply afraid that we will not be able to find it if we take off again for three days, and we will be in a difficult situation. Therefore, we fired countless blank shots that night and early the next morning, hoping that someone would come, but we knew that not only did we hear nothing, but we did not even see a bird or beast. After 12:00 on the 21st, we summoned the courage to take off again to search. When approaching Juyan Sea, we happened to encounter a camel herd, and we immediately descended to inquire. We were delighted to learn that the camel herd was Sheng Ruiheng transporting gasoline on behalf of the company, and had only arrived at the Ruoshui River four days ago and put it there to graze. After he indicated the shape and direction of the gasoline storage pool, we took off again. After about ten minutes, we arrived at our destination. A German and two Chinese people from the Sino-Swedish Scientific Expedition Team are stationed in this place, working hard all year round to test the climate, hoping to contribute to the scientific community. At night, we stayed in the Mongolian yurt where the German lived. At 10:00 am on the 22nd, we continued westward, crossed the northern branch of the Tianshan Mountains, passed Hami Turpan, and followed the Tianshan Gorge straight to Tonghua. It was already 5:30 pm. Because the journey was hard and the new land was extremely cold, often thirty degrees below zero at night, we planned to rest for a few days and then conduct a trial flight to Weitangzi on the extreme edge. Later, two fighter planes purchased by the Xinjiang Provincial Government from Russia happened to fly from Weitangzi to Dihua by Russian pilots on the 24th. In addition to inquiring about the details of the journey, as a reference, we also learned that there is only thick fog near a certain mountain between Dihua and Weitangzi every day at noon, but high flying will not touch the mountains. In addition, there were no other unsuitable flying conditions along the way, so we did not go there. It is estimated that this section (the third section), except for the section from Dihua to Weitangzi, which is not very difficult, as described above, the section from Hami to Dihua, because the Turpan lowlands are 200 meters below sea level and extremely hot in summer, making it extremely difficult to navigate, but it is still possible to proceed along the southern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains. In addition, there are no other unsuitable flying conditions. As for the section from Ruohe to Hami, the difficulty is the same as that from Wolf Mountain to Ruoshui River, and flying over the Tianshan branch that runs from north to south is more difficult than flying over Wolf Mountain, because Wolf Mountain is not very high, and the low point of the Tianshan branch is also 2,600 feet. We lived in Dihua for a total of seventeen days, and the people hung flags to welcome us, and the government warmly welcomed us. The Xinjiang Provincial Government and the people deeply hoped that the company's route could be realized as soon as possible, so that Xinjiang's national defense, culture, politics, industry, and so on could all be directly or indirectly benefited. In addition to being busy with social events, we also actively carried out various matters that should be contacted and investigated, such as where the Sino-Russian joint transportation should be, whether the radio can be installed properly, how to set up climate testing, entrust the construction of factory sheds and houses, and the output of valuable goods, and the amount of mail. The various matters were handled properly, and the gasoline arrived at 12:00 on the 7th of the month. We immediately took more than one hundred catties of valuables entrusted by the Xinjiang Provincial Government, as well as many official letters to various agencies in the interior, and 20 kilograms of mail sent from Xinjiang to Pingjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, and rushed to the airport to prepare for the return journey. That night, we stayed in the Mongolian yurt inside the airport. At 9:30 am on the 8th, we took off from Dihua, except for circling Dihua City once to express our gratitude, and then followed the old road to Ruoshui River. We arrived at Ruoshui River at 5:00 pm and stayed in the Mongolian yurt prepared by the Sino-Swedish Scientific Expedition Team. At 7:30 am on the 9th, we left Ruoshui River, passed Guihua at 12:30 pm without stopping, and flew directly to Beiping. We arrived in Beiping at 3:00 pm. We rested for three days, flew to Nanjing on the 12th to report the successful trial flight to the Ministry of Transportation, and flew back to Shanghai on the 12th. It took exactly one month from the departure from Shanghai on December 13 to the return to Shanghai on January 13, which is also a coincidence. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Tragedy Occurred Upstream of Yuezhou</p>
<p>Six Crew Members Killed and Ten Kidnapped</p>
<p>The shallow waters of the Yangtze River have caused significant losses to the operating revenues of the various river steamers on the upper and lower reaches. The shallow waters of Taizi Islet obstructed the steamers on the lower reaches, with as many as seven ships stranded last time. Although the Jianghai Customs Shallow Water Survey Ship has recently discovered a new channel with a draft of fifteen feet, it has just been discovered and has not yet been opened to navigation. In recent days, eight or nine more steamers sailing downstream have been obstructed in the area, using barges to transport and transfer cargo. The various steamers are delayed for a long time, delaying the schedule, and the travelers are suffering. On the upper reaches of the river, the recent shallow waters have also obstructed ships, resulting in robberies by river pirates, and even the tragedies of killing crew members and kidnapping passengers. The details will be recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Meishan Crew Members Killed: Mobil Oil Company has a number of steamers on the Yangtze River that transport kerosene and carry passengers and cargo, traveling to and from Shanghai, Hankou, Yichang, and Chongqing. The company's Meishan steamer was transporting cargo from Yichang this time, and there were no passengers on board. On the 7th of this month, when the ship arrived at the Yangling Islet River surface, a place called Yangling Islet, 25 nautical miles upstream of Yuezhou, it encountered shallow water. The Jianghan Customs had issued an earlier ban, stipulating that all ships traveling on the upper reaches of the river are not allowed to sail at night, in order to prevent accidental grounding on beaches. The Meishan steamer anchored at Yangling Islet, waiting to sail again the next morning. Unexpectedly, the bandits in the area were very fierce, specializing in robbery. They saw the Meishan steamer anchored and a large group of bandits boarded the Meishan steamer in civilian boats, hoping to rob it. It was found that there was no wireless telegraph on the Meishan steamer. When the bandits robbed, the crew had to take their own firearms and fight back with all their strength. The crew was outnumbered and the bandits rushed onto the ship, killing two crew members who resisted on the spot and throwing their bodies into the river. The money and items in the ship were all looted. Temporarily, eight crew members and sailors were kidnapped. According to a telegram received in Shanghai yesterday, four of the eight people kidnapped by the bandits had been killed by the bandits, and the whereabouts of the other four were still unknown. Now the Meishan steamer has been towed down by a ship sent by the company, and the losses from the theft on the ship are very large.</p>
<p>Jiejiang Crew and Passengers Kidnapped: The Shanghai-Chuanhe direct shuttle steamer No. 2 of the Jiejiang Company of this port was loaded with cargo and passengers and sailed to Yichang. On the 15th of this month, when the ship arrived at the felt hat beach, a place called Jinghekou, it was anchored as usual due to shallow water, waiting to sail again the next morning on the 16th. Unexpectedly, just after anchoring, the bandits on the shore knew about it. That night, the bandits led a crowd to board the ship and rob it. Baker, the owner of the ship, was punished by the crew of the Meishan steamer who were brutally killed by the bandits. He was deeply afraid that this bloody tragedy would be staged again, so he adopted a non-resistance policy. Therefore, when the bandits boarded the ship, he allowed the bandits to rob him without resisting. Therefore, although the bandits fired guns to show their power, they did not harm human lives. The bandits' goal was money. In addition to searching for cash and clothing on the ship, it was not enough to satisfy the bandits' desires. Before leaving, they kidnapped the shipowner Bao Zi, two sailors, and three passengers. The kidnapped crew and passengers have been taken to the bandit's den to extort huge sums of money to redeem them. The goods in the ship were not taken away. After the incident, the Jiejiang Company sent the Yichang steamer from Hankou to the felt hat beach to tow the No. 2 steamer to Yichang, and asked the US warship stationed in Hankou to protect it so that no accidents would happen again. Since the robbery of the two American ships, crew members and passengers were killed and kidnapped by bandits, the companies have reported to the American consul, requesting the Hubei authorities to find a way to arrest the bandits and rescue all the captives. It is heard that our country's navy has sent warships to patrol the upper reaches of Yuezhou and protect the merchant ships that come and go.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River Transferred Shallow Water Ships: In recent days, ships sailing on the Yangtze River can only load 20% or 30% of their cargo due to shallow water. If they load more, they cannot pass through. The various ship companies have suffered huge losses. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company specially transferred the Yichang shuttle steamer Kuali back to Shanghai to change to the Shanghai-Hankou route, in order to adjust operations and cope with the difficulty of the Yangtze River's shallow water. The ship will arrive in Shanghai and start sailing immediately.</p>

<p>The Yong'an No. 2 Yarn Factory on Yunzao Road, Wusong, has been closed since the tragic incident on the evening of December 20 last year, for a month now. After the incident, the factory immediately filed a lawsuit in court, and workers Shen Yongming and others were detained one after another and are still on trial. The workers requested the factory to pay four months' bonus, but the factory thought the amount was too large and there was no such precedent, so although the Social Affairs Bureau mediated several times, there was no result. It is learned that the factory, after announcing the closure, felt the plight of the workers, so it completed the organization of the machines and resumed work yesterday. The male and female workers went to work one after another after hearing the news. The order in the factory is still maintained by the police team. It is heard that the objects destroyed by the factory and the losses from the shutdown will cost about more than 300,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Women's Christian Association on Nanjing Road held its 21st annual meeting yesterday afternoon. More than one hundred members attended, and Mrs. Eddie, an American doctor's wife, also participated. At 3:30 PM, the opening ceremony was held, with Ms. Jin Maoyunqin, the chairperson, delivering the opening remarks. Following that, various departments presented performances, including an opening performance by the Board of Directors, a dance by the Education Department's children's class, a graduation song by students from the commoner school, speeches and harmonica ensembles by students from the Huaguang Troupe and Biwen Qingxin School under the Girls' Department, reports by commoner students and performances by laborers from the Labor Department, and a puppet show by several Western women from the International Branch. Later, Ms. Jin Maoyunqin reported on the reasons for moving to Nanjing Road last year, and staff members raised funds for flood relief, sewed and collected over four thousand pieces of new and used clothing and hats, and purchased three hundred pairs of shoes to help the flood victims. After the Northeast Incident occurred, they joined the Women's Grand Alliance, organized a discussion forum on the Northeast issue, and sent a telegram to Dr. Shi Zhaoji at the League of Nations for assistance. They also reported on items such as an upcoming exhibition in mid-April. Furthermore, they announced the newly elected directors for the year, including Ms. Yan Shunyuan, Ms. Xu Renyi, Mrs. Wang Shiqi, Ms. Ling Yang'aifang, and Mrs. Zhang Fuliang. Finally, they introduced the Chinese and Western staff members of each department to the members, after which tea and refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Two Chinese Detectives Extort Money from Suspects <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>After Discovery, Police Station Requests Severe Punishment</p>
<p>Chen A'er, a native of Jiangbei, was carrying smoking paraphernalia on Laodagu Road at 5:00 PM on the 18th of this month when he was stopped by Chinese Detective Yan Enshan, No. 1817, and Chinese Detective Qiao Zhaoyun, No. 1265, of the Xinzha Police Station. They arrested him, and Detective Yan found seventy silver dollars on Chen's person. Yan told Chen that if the money were discovered by the police station, it would be confiscated, so it would be better for him to keep it safe and return it to Chen upon his release from prison. Consequently, the detective deposited the money at a porridge shop at No. 326 Aivenyi Road before taking Chen to the police station. Unexpectedly, Chen reported the incident to the prison warden while in the police station jail. The warden informed the police chief, who considered the two detectives' behavior to be a violation of Article 337 of the criminal law regarding fraudulent acquisition of property. He ordered their detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court's criminal division. Detective Qiao hired lawyer Chen Tingrui for his defense. The police station's lawyer, Qian Jiu, argued that since the two defendants, Yan and Qiao, were public officials, they should be severely punished for knowingly breaking the law. Subsequently, Chen A'er, Wang Xiaogou, and Wu Xizi from the Aivenyi Road porridge shop testified, proving that Detective Yan took and deposited the money. However, they could not prove that Qiao Zhaoyun was involved in the conspiracy. Judge Shen Shumu reviewed the evidence and questioned Yan and the others, but they denied the allegations. As a result, the court sentenced Yan Enshan to six months in prison and acquitted Qiao Zhaoyun. Qiao posted bail, ensuring his availability for any further proceedings during the appeal period.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Three Murder Cases <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>A Child's Body with Hands and Feet Bound Found in the Huangpu River: Yesterday, the body of a child was found floating near a buoy at No. 13 Yangshupu. A patrol boat from the Water Police Station retrieved the body. The deceased was only about two years old, with his hands and feet bound by ropes, suggesting he had been murdered and thrown into the river to drown. The body has been taken to the Salvation Bureau, and an investigator has been dispatched to the local court to conduct an autopsy.</p>
<p>A Girl's Body with a Neck Wound Found: Yesterday morning, a small wooden box was discovered in a trash can behind Baolong Lane, Yifeng Lane, inside Ximen. Upon inspection by patrol officers, it was found to contain the body of a girl. The girl was only about two years old, completely naked, with a blood-stained cloth shirt beside her. The child's neck had a knife wound, and her entire body was covered in blood. The Second District, First Precinct, was immediately notified and instructed the local leader, Jin Qiren, to report to the local court for an autopsy.</p>
<p>A Woman's Body with Hands and Feet Bound with Cotton Yarn Found: Yesterday morning, an unidentified female corpse was discovered on vacant land belonging to the Mitsubishi Company in Behetang, Lanlidu, Pudong. The deceased appeared to be in her thirties, wearing a straight gongni cotton-padded jacket and pants. However, her hands and feet were bound with cotton yarn ropes on the outside, and no injuries were found underneath. It is proven that she was murdered before her death, as there is no reason for her limbs to be bound otherwise. The Third District Police Station has instructed the local leader, Xie A'long, from the Twenty-fourth District, to report to the court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Using Bad Checks to Defraud Goods <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Geng Desen, Yu Ziqing, Shao Lianzhai, and Dai Xiangsheng jointly opened the Gengda Foreign Goods Store at No. 26 Fadama Road in December of last year. They successively purchased drugs, foreign goods, cosmetics, and other goods from 26 companies, including Jihua Tang Pharmacy, Huazhang Store, Shanghai Factory, Peacock Society, and Guang Shengxiang. They paid with checks from the Longchang Qianzhuang with a due date of the 20th of the same month. When the banks attempted to collect payment from the Qianzhuang on the due date, the checks were returned due to insufficient funds. When the companies tried to collect from the store, it had already closed down on the same date as the check expiration, and the people had fled, taking all the goods with them. Only then did the money houses realize that the store had deliberately engaged in fraud by issuing bad checks. Consequently, Yuan Hesong, manager of Jihua Tang, and the other 26 creditors, jointly retained lawyer Lin Yingqing to file a criminal lawsuit with the Second Special Court, accusing the shareholders of the store of issuing bad checks and seeking civil compensation for the amount of the checks. The court accepted the case, and yesterday, Judge Ma Shounan summoned both parties to court for a hearing. The defendants failed to appear, but the plaintiff's lawyer was present and stated the facts of the case, requesting that the defendants be arrested and punished according to the criminal law and the negotiable instruments law, and that civil compensation be awarded for the amount of the checks, totaling 2,038 taels and 63 silver dollars. Judge Ma declared that the hearing would be postponed until the defendants were arrested and brought to court.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the disaster relief shelter in Gonghe Road, Zhabei, the premises have been extremely crowded, and many disaster-stricken women are pregnant and giving birth. Zhu Qiluo, the director of hygiene at the shelter, is now aiming to provide perfect midwifery assistance for the disaster victims. In addition to providing a subsidy of two yuan per expectant mother, he has also consulted with outstanding graduates from the Sino-German Midwifery School on Jing'an Temple Road, as well as well-known physicians from the Civilian Obstetrics Hospital, to jointly provide assistance. This initiative commenced a few days ago, with the regular dispatch of individuals to the shelter on a weekly rotating basis to provide voluntary obstetrical services. Consequently, the women at the shelter who are giving birth are all receiving safe and happy care, and their joy is palpable. The dedication and enthusiasm of the teachers and students of the school in benefiting the disaster victims and contributing to the well-being of society are truly admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Lawyers with Overdue Fees Take Note <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Pay Fees Within Three Days of Receiving Notice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association has a total of seven hundred and several dozen members. According to the regulations approved by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, each member is required to pay a monthly membership fee of two silver dollars. If a member's membership fees are overdue for more than four months, the Bar Association is required to report their dismissal from the association according to the regulations. An investigation reveals that there are over forty members with overdue fees. The association originally intended to proceed according to the regulations, but for the sake of convenience, the executive and supervisory committee held a joint meeting and decided to handle the matter in accordance with the regulations. To further facilitate the process, a final notice was reissued yesterday, urging members to submit their overdue fees to the association within three days of receiving this notice. If they do so, their names will be removed from the list of those to be dismissed. Failure to pay within the deadline will result in the loss of membership status starting from the fourth day.</p>

The meeting was chaired by Dr. Luo Yunyan, Vice President of the Child Welfare Association. After delivering a welcoming speech, they invited Xiong Xiling and Zhu Qinglan to give speeches and decided to convene a national child welfare conference. The details of the previous day's meeting are recorded below.</p>
<p>Attendees: Xiong Buling, Zhu Qinglan, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Lu Bohong, Chen Heling, Pan Shilin from the Shanghai Child Welfare and Education Institute, Hu Yuanzhou from the Shanghai First Disaster Relief Shelter, Zhang Xufu from the Shanghai Orphanage, Feng Liutang, Section Chief of the Fourth Section of the Social Bureau, Li Jin, Commissioner of the Hankou Flood Relief, Wang Zhongfu from the Women and Children Relief Association, Huang Xingjie from the Shanghai Nursery, Wang Aitian from the Child Welfare Association, Hua Jingyuan from the Health Clinic, Wu Zhijian from the Leprosy Relief Association, Huang Jibei from the Puyi Vocational Training Center, Fu Ruoyu from the YMCA, and three Western women, among others.</p>

He briefly stated that Mr. Xiong has been running the Xiangshan Child Welfare Institute in Beijing for over a decade. His enthusiasm and experience are greatly admired by all. It is a true honor for them to receive his presence and guidance.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiong's Speech: Mr. Xiong expressed five hopes for the child welfare cause: 1. To unify national child welfare organizations, complementing each other's strengths and compensating for each other's weaknesses. 2. To improve China's early childhood education with scientific and new knowledge. 3. To train specialized child welfare professionals, establish nanny schools, and assign them to serve in various regions, dispatching experts to orphanages in various regions for investigation and improvement. 4. To convene a national child welfare conference annually, rotating the location. 5. To conduct a major publicity campaign on the April 4th Children's Day to make the entire nation aware of the importance of child welfare and to encourage donations to support this righteous cause.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu's Speech: Mr. Zhu Qinglan briefly stated that various child welfare organizations, such as orphanages and nurseries, have been initiated by sages in various regions of China. Their establishment was not easy, and we must maintain and improve them. We must pay close attention to the child welfare cause. Therefore, a child welfare section was established within the Hankou Flood Relief Committee, hoping that specialized child welfare professionals would take charge. He hoped that the Child Welfare Association could take full responsibility, and he would do his best to assist. He also hoped that the Child Welfare Association could initiate a national child welfare conference to be held annually, imitating the methods of the National Medical Association, in order to gather collective wisdom. He would work together with everyone to make it a success.</p>

Today, they have honored us with their presence and guidance, and we would like to express our respect and gratitude to the two gentlemen on behalf of the Child Welfare Association and all the children in the country.</p>
<p>Child Welfare Conference: After Dr. Luo delivered his closing remarks, it was decided that the representatives of the various charitable organizations present would initiate the convening of a national child welfare conference and establish the China Child Welfare Association to prepare for everything and set a date for the conference.</p>
<p>Xiong's Daughter Studies in the United States: After the meeting, Mr. Xiong told a reporter from the Xinshi News Agency that, in view of the importance of the child welfare cause, he had sent his daughter, Xiong Zhi, to Columbia University in the United States to specialize in child welfare issues, hoping that she would return to the country and work hard for the child welfare cause in China.</p>
<h3 id="e107">American Ms. Laim's Mission to China <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Will Explore Qinghai</p>
<p>The Damei Evening News reports that Ms. Laim, an American member of the Royal Geographical Society of Britain, has recently arrived in China, sponsored by the New York Explorers Club, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the New York Brooklyn Museum, to explore Qinghai. She arrived in Shanghai with her husband and assistant a few days ago and is currently negotiating with the Nanjing authorities to obtain a passport. Once the formalities are completed, she will depart. There are three possible routes, which are currently under consideration and have not yet been decided: one is to travel from Beijing to Baotou and proceed along the caravan route, another is to travel to Baotou and then proceed westward through Ningxia, and the third is to enter the provinces of Henan and Shanxi via the Pinghan Railway. The purpose of this trip is to collect information on geography and to explore for Ma Qingshan (transliteration). It is said that this mountain is higher than Mount Everest in India, which is known as the highest in the world.

Compatriots, please provide as much assistance as possible, whether in spirit or in material form.</p>

<p>Factory Accepts Conditions for Resuming Work</p>
<p>The Guomin She reports that the Springhua Rubber Factory on Scissors Bridge Road, Nanshi, previously had a dispute because engineer Mao Wenzhi prohibited apprentices from gambling, injured Italian worker Lin Liangxian and Yang Linlin, and imposed inappropriate punishments. The First District Rubber Products Industry Labor Union filed a petition with the Party and government authorities for handling, and the Social Bureau temporarily sent the child laborers Lin Liangxian and the other thirteen to the Xinpu Yutang for care. However, keeping them in the Xinpu Yutang for a long time, lacking production methods, is not a good strategy. Rubber industry union member He Pengchong contacted factory investigator Xu Haiquan to take over the management, agreeing to abide by factory rules and resume work, proposing two conditions: 1. The factory must be responsible for treating the injuries of apprentices Lin Liangxian and Yang Linlin. 2. When they return to work, the factory must provide each of them with a set of cloth jackets and clothes. It is reported that the factory, out of consideration for the apprentices, has fully accepted these conditions.</p>

<h3 id="e116">The House of a Puxiong District Security Regiment Platoon Leader Robbed <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>One Thief Shot Dead on the Spot</p>
<p>Gang of Thieves Scared Away Without Successfully Robbing</p>
<p>Zhuangjiajing in Puxiong District is a small market town in the district, conveniently located at a strategic point along the Wusong River. The area is remote, without military or police protection, and is only defended by the locally organized Security Regiment. Therefore, robberies are unavoidable every winter. Wang Jusheng, who owns some assets and is moderately wealthy, runs the Gongtonghe Cloth Shop in the area, which is doing well. His son, Wang Yifu, serves as a platoon leader in the Security Regiment. Due to the environment, he is constantly vigilant and always sleeps with a gun after his winter duty. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 20th of this month, thieves coveted and came to rob his house. It was 2:00 AM, and everyone was sound asleep, with no noise. A gang of more than twenty thieves approached from the south along the banks of the Wusong River, loitering outside the door. Wang Yifu, who was sleeping in the front shop, heard the noise in his sleep and woke up. Recognizing the sound of thieves, he grabbed his gun and got up to defend himself. Soon, the thieves used tools to break down the door. Realizing the danger, he fired a shot with his box cannon, but the door remained intact. So he fired several more shots, one of which hit a thief, who fell to the ground. Yifu's father and brother also woke up upon hearing the gunshots and fired the newly prepared regiment's guns into the air. The thieves, knowing they could not succeed, fled. Yifu's father and son, still fearing the thieves were waiting outside, did not dare to open the door. After observing that there was no sound outside, they cautiously opened the door and found a thief lying on the ground, holding a 1,500-foot electric torch. Beside him were an iron bar and two six-inch pistol shell casings. They went to Huacao Town to report to the Sixth District, First Precinct Police Station and reported to the Security Regiment headquarters. The police station found several pawn tickets on the thief, all from the British Concession, proving that the thief did not come from the local area. The chief of the Sixth District, First Precinct, has inspected the situation and reported it to his superiors. The thief's body has been reported by the local leader to the local court for an autopsy. Zhuangjiajing is located at a strategic point, and defense is crucial. It is hoped that the authorities will establish more police stations to ensure public safety.</p>

After investigation, there is no person named Yu Erwei in our group. I am afraid that the report is inaccurate, and it is highly related to the group's reputation.

<p>Save the Nation by Saving Yourself First</p>
<p>Regarding the path that young people should take, this newspaper has published the opinions of Mr. Wang Leyi and Mr. Huang Juemin successively. Mr. Wang quoted Yi Xiasheng's words, "If you want to benefit society, you must forge yourself into a sharp weapon." Mr. Huang's proposition is to "do worldly affairs with a detached spirit." Both of these ideas are very good, and I especially agree with Mr. Wang's quotation of Yi's remarks. Young people are the vitality and lifeline of the country, and the mission they bear is extremely important. How should we cultivate our knowledge and train our bodies so that we can undertake arduous tasks and cope with difficulties? If we only shout slogans with one breath and with passion, post slogans, or even abandon our books all day long, gathering and marching like bees, this will not only fail to help the difficulties of the time, but will also make the most precious time of our youth a futile sacrifice. The gains do not outweigh the losses, which is regrettable. Moreover, there are bound to be one or two unscrupulous elements among them who take the opportunity to act in the name of patriotism and seek the limelight. Their arguments are very激烈, and their behavior inevitably becomes too extreme. As a result, they only cause pain to their relatives and pleasure to their enemies, which is of no benefit to both themselves and the country, and lose the sympathy of society. Is this not young people isolating themselves from the masses? Therefore, Mr. Huang Yanpei published a short article in "Middle School Students," the first sentence of which is "Save the nation by saving yourself first." I think this can be our motto for young people. Now I will record it below. Save the nation by saving yourself first: 1. Everyone should unite and quickly abandon all thoughts of jealousy, suspicion, selfishness, and self-interest. 2. Train your body well. 3. Believe in science and study science. Finally, the last two sentences: All the good things I think are good, start from your own family. All the bad things I think are bad, start from your own family (Ding).</p>

<p>A person named He Enguang previously submitted a letter stating that in order to fight against the violent Japanese, we should be careful to prevent poison gas. The original letter stated that the use of charcoal masks soaked in hexamethylenetetramine solution to defend against poison gas was theoretically flawed and practically incomplete. Because the research on gas masks in recent times has reached a fairly complete field, it is not as simple as the item mask. However, the preparations for the mask and the order for military doctors to study the rescue of poison gas and university professors to study the defense methods, in addition to the military and political department instructing the military doctors to follow the detailed study of various poison gas poisoning treatment and rescue methods, the Ministry of Education has previously notified various universities and related education departments to inform the chemical professors to study in detail various poison gas technical defense methods. Several schools and chemistry professors are currently discussing and conducting considerable experiments.</p>

<p>Due to the Ministry of Education's failure to allocate the 20th year education funds for Zhejiang University, there was once a wave of resignations from faculty and staff. It has now been learned that the school has already ended the first semester of the 20th academic year, and the amount of funds owed is very large, making it difficult to support expenditures. Therefore, it has sent another telegram urging the Ministry of Education to quickly allocate all the fees owed in full to repay the debts. The school's semester examination for the first semester was not held due to the patriotic movement, and the examination will be held in the second semester to determine academic credits. The course programs that were not completed during the suspension period of the first semester are planned to be extended during the summer vacation to make up for the shortfall.</p>

<p>Central Committee member Gui Chongji was previously appointed as the president of National Central University by the order of the Executive Yuan. Gui expressed his unwillingness to take the position due to various reasons. Although the authorities have expressed their intention to retain him, he has decided to resign due to the school's financial difficulties. He sent a telegram to President Sun yesterday requesting his resignation. The original text is as follows: "To Sun Jun, President of the Executive Yuan: Throughout his life, Chongji has vowed to make education his lifelong career. Since returning to the country, he has never lightly left the lecture hall. Recently, he has been determined to get rid of all political restraints and not be involved in them again. He was appointed as the president of National Central University, and how dare he refuse? Considering the decline of academic morals in recent years, cunning people regard education as a stepping stone, opening up the minds of young people to external pursuits, inducing students to advance their careers, and building trenches against each other to compete. They are serving their own personal interests and ruining the country's century-long plan. Therefore, as soon as the new appointment was announced, disputes were immediately seen. Chongji's foolishness does not want to turn his ambition to run schools into students' patriotism and harm the foundation of the country. Therefore, he is determined to resign and let the more capable people take over. He sincerely begs for your understanding. Gui Chongji respectfully bows."</p>
<h3 id="e136">He Zhensheng and Others Request the Dismissal of Xiang, Director of Jinshan Education Bureau <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>A letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Education</p>
<p>He Zhensheng and other Jinshan celebrities in Shanghai yesterday submitted a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Education. The letter to the provincial government is transcribed below: "We are submitting this letter to request the dismissal and punishment of Xiang Weixian, the director of the Jinshan County Education Bureau, for dereliction of duty and malfeasance. Xiang Weixian, the director of the Jinshan County Education Bureau, is unfamiliar with education, sloppy in his work, and hides and destroys things. We filed a lawsuit against him on December 5th of last year. However, according to the inspection report of the provincial supervisor Cao, the number of schools has decreased by sixteen and the number of school grades has decreased by thirty-two within five years, which is the ironclad evidence that Xiang has destroyed education. This only refers to the quantity. As for the corruption of quality, we will once again report it to you in detail. Last year's high school graduation examination was handled by Shanghai Middle School Experimental Primary School. The original score for passing the examination was 50 points or more. A total of 155 people participated, and only 23 people passed, accounting for only 15% of the total number of candidates. Xiang witnessed the poor results and knew that it was related to his face, so he had to come up with a strange idea and privately lowered the passing standard. All scores above 20 points were granted graduation. Thus, the number of graduates reached 148 people. Whether or not this examination standard has been approved by the Department of Education, it has already been specified in advance, and it should not be freely increased or decreased afterwards. He is usually not responsible for education supervision, allowing students' levels to decline day by day. When there are restrictions during the examination, he arbitrarily lowers the standards to perfunctorily cover up his actions and seek fame and reputation. No wonder that students graduating from our county over the past three or four years have not been admitted to secondary schools in Shanghai. Alas, how unfortunate it is to be a Jinshan student, and how unfortunate it is to be a student under the rule of the current Education Bureau of Jinshan. Who has no hometown, who has no children? The experiences of the students in our county are the same. Those who live in other places cannot help but sympathize with them and think of ways to save them. Xiang Weixian has been the director of the Jinshan Education Bureau for four years. The budget and final accounts have never been announced. It was not until the people repeatedly filed lawsuits that the budgets for the 19th and 20th years were printed and distributed together. However, the order of the items listed in the booklet was reversed, confusing people. For example, the Yi education sub-book for the 20th year is completely different from that of the 19th year. In the 20th year's booklet, the Liugang Elementary School in the 57th section is different before and after the district. Other schools, such as Nanliu Cunyang and other schools, have long been suspended, but the budget is still included. It is clear that the Changong and other schools have owed Changfei for one month each in the 17th, 18th, and 19th years, but they have not been returned in the total expenditures for the 20th year. It seems that the amount owed to the schools, whether it is stored in the bureau or moved for other purposes, is like trying to cover it up. How can he show his integrity and honesty? All of these things are not only known to the whole county, but are also on record. As for the provincial committee members who came to the county to investigate, they were often deceived by Xiang's flattery and good words without realizing it. Today, although the country is in trouble, the provincial government is renewing itself. You take the spirit of rectifying the army and preparing for war, maintain the great plan of planting trees for a hundred years, save the people from water and fire, and help the country in times of danger. In your spare time to manage the country, remember that education is the lifeline of the country. Quickly order the Department of Education to dismiss and punish Xiang Weixian, the director of the Jinshan County Education Bureau, to comply with public opinion and value education. We are anxiously awaiting your orders."</p>

<h3 id="e138">The Middle School Federation Helps Students of Soochow First Middle School <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>A letter to the Shanghai Education Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Federation, in order to save the country's youth from losing their education, because the entire student body of Soochow First Middle School was unwilling to have the school authorities suppress the anti-Japanese movement and planned to leave the school as a whole, sent a letter to the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday to request permission for the students of Soochow First Middle School to transfer to various schools in Shanghai. The original letter is transcribed as follows: "To the Shanghai Education Bureau: Our association has received a report from representatives of the students of Soochow First Middle School in Suzhou, stating that the students have been severely suppressed by the school authorities for their efforts in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. The entire student body is eager to save the country and is unwilling to be suppressed. They plan to leave school and transfer to Shanghai as a whole, requesting assistance from our association. Our association sent personnel to investigate and found that the report was true. Yesterday, after careful discussion by the members of our association, it was generally believed that the school was established by the church as a cultural institution for imperialism to invade our country. The government has long had plans to take back the education power. Today, the school dares to blatantly suppress our students' patriotic movement. Our association, based on its purpose of anti-Japanese national salvation, cannot sit idly by when hundreds of patriotic students are suppressed. Therefore, a unanimous resolution was made to pledge full assistance. Your bureau is the administrative organ of Shanghai education. We urge you to order your subordinates to give special preferential treatment to the students of Soochow First Middle School and allow them to freely transfer to various schools. The students of Soochow can achieve their wish to transfer schools and will not be suppressed again. This is not only what our association hopes for, but also related to the dignity of the Chinese nation. We have always admired your bureau's sympathy for students' national salvation movement, and we believe that you will be happy to support us. We are writing specifically to request this, and we hope that you will reply to us. Sincerely, Shanghai Education Bureau."</p>

<p>The Public Library of the Public Works Bureau has recently undergone significant improvements, and several new plans will be implemented. In recent days, the number of fee-paying patrons has increased considerably, so the Library Committee has recommended increasing funding to allow more people to read. The annual fee for military personnel will be reduced by five yuan. Qualified school students, with proof from their principal and a guarantee from a taxpayer, will also enjoy this reduced fee, but the books they borrow may not be novels.</p>
<p>The budget for purchasing new books in 1932 has been increased from 1,500 taels to 1,800 taels, and the binding fee has been increased from 500 taels to 600 taels. The budget for newspapers and magazines remains at 1,100 taels, but several Chinese newspapers and magazines will be added this year. Hard covers will be added to all magazines on display. Paper bags and slips will be added to books for loan to prevent damage during transport within the library. Additionally, 50 taels of silver will be allocated to purchase a V-shaped bookshelf transport cart. Regarding the book purchasing policy, the committee advocates that the ratio of fiction to non-fiction books should be three to one.</p>
<h3 id="e144">New Developments in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Night School <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Adding Morning Classes and Expanding Subjects</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Commercial Night School has been operating arduously for ten years. Last autumn, recognizing the urgent need for Chinese typing personnel, it established a Chinese typing class. The first session concluded on the 15th of this month, and registration for the second session has already begun. However, the school has found that the number of night school students applying for admission is overwhelming, often exceeding the quota. Due to the limited number of classrooms, many aspiring young students are turned away. Therefore, Principal Lu Fengzhu recently drafted a plan to expand morning classes to accommodate students who exceed the night class quota. This plan was endorsed by Chairman Wang Xiaozai, Standing Committee member Fang Jiaobo, and others. It was decided to greatly expand the morning classes, transforming the Chinese typing class into a clerical studies department and adding a commercial studies department as a remedial option for students exceeding the night class quota. It is reported that the clerical studies department will include three courses: Chinese typing, French, and drawing (library science can be taken as an elective). The commercial studies department will include five courses: commercial knowledge, English, abacus, bookkeeping, and accounting, which are largely the same as the night school courses. This is truly good news for out-of-school youth in the industry. Registration begins immediately. Anyone with a secondary education level or equivalent can enroll. Classes are held every morning from 6:45 AM to 8:30 AM (the practical time for Chinese typing and library science is not included in this). The quota for the clerical studies department is tentatively set at 50 students, and the quota for the commercial studies department is tentatively set at 80 students. Both men and women are accepted. Detailed regulations are available, and a reply will be sent with a one-cent stamp attached.</p>

<p>Since the invasion of the Japanese bandits, there have been many books studying Japan, but few have been able to fully expose the hideous faces of the Japanese bandits from all aspects. Recently, the World Magazine Agency, recognizing this, specially commissioned a person who has studied Japan for many years and is an expert in Japanese affairs to conduct detailed research on economics, culture, military preparations, politics, and the invasion of Northeast China and Mongolia, compiling all statistics, and exposing the current situation in Taiwan under Japanese imperialism, striving to place the entire Japanese bandit under a microscope so that Chinese people can understand the true face of the Japanese bandit after reading this book. The book is titled "Japanese Bandits Under the Microscope" and contains a total of nineteen articles, such as Xu Gongyi's "Japan's Economic Aggression Policy Against China," Xu Yiqiao's "The Manchurian Problem," Yan Shixiong's "Anatomy of the South Manchuria Railway," and Liu Jiaxun's "Political Organization," with the Tanaka Memorial attached. The entire book contains more than 200,000 words and is priced at six dimes. It can be purchased from the World Bookstores in Shanghai and other provinces.</p>

<p>|Yangshupu vs. Huadong from 8:30 PM|</p>
<p>B Group Sections 5, 6, and 7 Have Concluded</p>
<p>B4 Group Qixing Apparel Team Finals Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association is divided into eight groups this time. B Groups 4, 5, 6, and 7 have already concluded. B Groups 1, 2, and 3 and A Group will begin tonight. A total of ten teams have joined A Group this time, namely Tongji, Xiqing, Qingguang, Qingnian, Chizhi, Mailing, Zhenru, Jianhua, Huadong, and Yangshupu (formerly Qianghua). The strength of each team is very evenly matched, and the competition interest will surely surpass that of the Xiqing Basketball League. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Four Games Tonight</p>
<p>Tonight is the inaugural game for A Group. The teams competing are Huadong and Yangshupu. The players of both teams are well-known in Shanghai. Huadong has Liang Guoquan, Ouyang Yongyuan, Chen Qidong, Li Baocheng, Dai Linzhen, and others. In addition to Qian Jingyong, Li Ruchun, Feng Zhenghua, Sun Baoqing, Lu Zhonghui, and others, the Yangpu team also has veteran Lu Zhongen joining, so the strength is quite impressive. Tonight's battle will surely add a lot of color to Chinese basketball. Also, in B Group 1, Meiyi will face Nanxing. Meiyi is the American Public School team, and Nanxing is the Jiaotong University team. Their skills are no less than those of A Group. There should also be a good performance at that time. The order of the four games tonight is as follows:</p>
<p>Competing Teams Group Time Referee</p>
<p>Pao Team vs. Yuguang B3 5:30 PM Lu Xiangqian</p>
<p>Jianye vs. Huopo B2 6:30 PM Wu Jia</p>
<p>Meitong vs. Nanxing B1 7:30 PM Lu Zhongen</p>
<p>Huadong vs. Yangshupu A Group 8:30 PM Xu Zhendong</p>
<h3 id="e147">Strength of Each Team in A Group <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Tongji: The Tongji University basketball team has always had considerable achievements. According to the team's instructor Li Jiyuan, the strength this season is better than last year. Ji Yubiao and Li Silin have made great progress in their skills, and the remaining players are also considered average. They will surely have a good performance in the future.</p>
<p>Xiqing: This team is the three-time champion of the Xiqing Basketball League. Its outstanding talent and solid lineup have long been known in this circle. Last year's Shanghai A Group champion also belonged to this team. This season's talent remains the same, and they have extremely high hopes for winning the championship again. The Chinese teams must be careful.</p>
<p>Qingguang: This team has a long history. This year, it has shown some decline in the Xiqing Basketball League. However, with the support of Chizhi's mainstay Kong Guangyi and the Red Team's famous player Xu Kepei, the results should be impressive. Kong and Xu were originally under Qingguang in the past, and their efforts contributed to Qingguang's dominance in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Qingnian: This year's Qingnian is not the Qingnian in last year's B Group. St. John's University's Lin Zequn and Wu Youliang are old players from last year. In addition to Lin and Wu, St. John's Chen Xianglong, Cheng Jingxing, Hou Xuemin, and Shanghai University's Wu Guolin and Wang Xiliang have also joined. St. John's ranked second in the Xiqing Basketball League. The excellence of their skills is self-evident. Now, with the addition of Shanghai University's Wu and Wang, the strength is even more abundant. They have great hopes of defeating Xiqing (i.e., the Pirates) and seizing the championship.</p>
<p>Chizhi: Everyone knows that this is the Chizhi College team. However, the departure of the team's mainstay Kong Guangyi to join Qingguang will have a significant impact on their strength. Last year's main player Xia Zeren has also changed to Jianhua. The team has suffered a great loss.</p>
<p>Mailing: This team had quite good results in last year's Shanghai Basketball Association. Even this season, it is not weak in the Xiqing Basketball League. The talent includes Bi Xuppo, Humphrey, Yong Bolong, and many new famous players. This team is also one of the teams with hopes of winning the championship.</p>
<p>Zhenru: This team is the Jinan University team. At the beginning of this season's Xiqing Basketball League, the military appearance was quite strong. It once defeated Jiangda champion Chizhi by a score of 42 to 40. Later, due to Li Chengyuan's resignation and Huang Zhaolin's slackness, the results were relatively poor. If they can unite in good faith, they can still achieve special results in the Shanghai Basketball Association.</p>
<p>Jianhua: This team is formed by the merger of Ye Shi and Xia Guang. At the end of the Xiqing Basketball League, these two teams stood out and surprised people, gaining the attention of this circle. Now there are celebrities such as Xia Zeren, Chen Baoqiu, Wei Zuohan, and Ren Jiexing. In the future, the results will be very impressive.</p>
<p>Huadong: This team is full of veterans with rich experience. If they can give it a little time, it will not be difficult to restore the old view. The details have been described above, so I will not repeat them here.</p>
<p>Yangshupu: This team is the Shanghai University High School alumni team. The strength has been detailed in the section "Four Games Tonight." The up-and-coming talents and celebrities in this circle will surely make some achievements in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Right and Wrong (Below) <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The current power is the power that takes advantage. In the dictionary of those who bow down to the current power, there is no "right and wrong." If there is, it is annotated differently.</p>
<p>Only allowing oneself to be right and forcing others to be wrong is a common trick of the current power. Sometimes even crying for injustice is not allowed. In this situation, those who suffer injustice can only fight for right and wrong. It is so uneconomical to have to fight for right and wrong with force!</p>
<p>The judgment of right and wrong mostly contains the characteristics of the times, region, and class. One era has its era's "right and wrong," one region has its region's "right and wrong," and one class has its class's "right and wrong."</p>
<p>Using a ruler to measure cloth, using a dipper to measure rice, what are the ruler and dipper for measuring right and wrong? As a member of the modern Chinese masses, I propose the following standards for right and wrong:</p>
<p>(1) What is public is right: What is not public is wrong. What increases the welfare of the masses is right; what harms the welfare of the masses is wrong. When the welfare of the masses conflicts with the welfare of small groups, supporting the welfare of the masses is right; supporting the welfare of small groups is wrong.</p>
<p>(2) What is true is right: What is not true is wrong.</p>
<p>(3) What promotes the progress of the times is right; what hinders the progress of the times is wrong.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Shouzhou Sun Yu Biography Wang Chang <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Sun Yu was a native of Shouzhou. He was known in his village for his boxing skills. There was a stone in his village that weighed eight hundred pounds. He could carry it for a hundred steps without resting. People called him Sun Eight Hundred. Yu also had high expectations for himself. Wu Qing, the Central Envoy of the Countryside, heard of him and promoted him to Chiliarch. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in the Guangxu Jiawu year, the Central Envoy volunteered to go out of the pass. Yu was overjoyed and eager to go. He led his disciples of a hundred people and followed the Central Envoy. The scholar's word was big. In fact, he was not familiar with military affairs. He collapsed first upon hearing the sound of cannons and lost his whereabouts. Yu stamped his feet and wept, saying, "How can I face entering the pass now?" He alone led his disciples to trace him. Unexpectedly, they encountered Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army was nearly a thousand strong. Yu measured the situation and was no match for them. He retreated into the forest and had his disciples abandon their horses and climb trees, watching in the dark. The Japanese were unpredictable. They surrounded the forest with troops and searched it extensively. Anyone who entered the forest died. The Japanese were blocked by the forest. Guns could not be used. After a long time, the Japanese also remained silent. Yu and his disciples discussed, saying, "The Japanese are not advancing because they know that fighting in the forest is unfavorable. If they don't leave, will they wait for the cannons to arrive? If the cannons arrive, we will have no chance. It is better to break through quickly. We may still live." So they searched for horses and jumped out in succession. The Japanese were unprepared. They engaged in close combat in a hurry. Yu's disciples fought bravely with waist knives. The Japanese army was forced back. Yu estimated that if they went a little further, they would be trapped by firearms. He and his disciples struggled to disturb them. Enemies and friends were mixed up. They fought and seized each other. The Japanese guns could not be fired in the end. A certain Japanese major was skilled in jujutsu. He jumped from his horse to face Yu. Yu glared and shouted loudly, waving his knife and chopping horizontally. Both the man and the horse were cut in half. At dusk, he had cut down nearly a hundred people by hand. General Zhang Gaoyuan's troops arrived, and they were able to escape. They lost twelve disciples and killed hundreds of Japanese. The Japanese army's morale was shaken. However, due to the defeat of the Central Envoy, the merit was not recorded. He eventually returned to his village as a commoner and lived to old age.</p>
<p>Wang Chang said, "Mr. Weng Yinruo told my late father that Yu was tall and had long arms. He was simple and spoke little. People didn't think much of him. I didn't expect him to be able to kill bandits. Alas! If Yu could find his lord and assist him, how could his merit be measured? However, he was eventually submerged, impoverished, and died of old age. It is sad. However, Yu was still able to kill bandits at that time. Now there are people with Yu's talent, but they are suppressed by incompetent lords, concealing their weapons and dragging their soldiers, rotting their hearts and gnashing their teeth, watching the rampant bandits rampaging and waiting to die. That is even more sad. Alas!"</p>
<h3 id="e155">A Record of the Sino-Western Football Circle Social <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Huaiqing</p>
<p>The Malayan Overseas Chinese football team came to Shanghai again. They stayed for ten days and played five games. Although the results were poor, their spirit was commendable. The other night, the Chinese National Sports Association hosted a banquet for the team at Guyixuan on Sanma Road. Leading figures from the Chinese and Western football circles, as well as the Shanghai Port International Football Team of the Westerners Football Association, the Chinese Football Team, and reporters from various newspapers, were invited to accompany them. There were an estimated seventy or eighty Chinese and Western guests, an unprecedented occasion for an ordinary banquet. Therefore, I record the anecdotes as follows.</p>
<p>Eating Guidance: The wine and dishes that night were all Chinese-style. However, there were more than twenty Westerners attending. It has become commonplace for Chinese people to eat Western food. However, it is rare to see Westerners eating Chinese food. Those who have lived in Shanghai for a long time are not short of experts in this regard. However, that night, the players of the port team, British army players such as Lincoln and Scott, the health team, and the special service team were like virgins who had never tried Chinese food. Therefore, they panicked upon arrival and didn't know how to start. This kind of timid and weak state was very different from the mighty demeanor they showed on the football field in front of thousands of spectators. The Sports Association staff Zhou Jiaqi specially instructed Lu Zhongen, Yu Hengzhi, and Chen Zhenhe to accompany them and serve as temporary eating guides. It was truly an interesting event.</p>
<p>Toasting and Singing: In Western customs, there is a ritual of toasting and singing to celebrate each other at banquets. That night, the Chinese and Westerners were mixed, so this kind of etiquette was inevitable. After the chairman Zhao Jinqing (director of the Sports Association) finished his speech, he presented a silver cup to the Malayan Chinese football team, with the four words "Courageous and Diligent" inscribed on it. It was received by the leader of the Malayan team, Mr. Yu Zhuohua. Everyone raised their glasses and sang to congratulate Malaya. After that, the Secretary-General of the Sports Association, Mr. Shen Silang, also expressed his sincere gratitude to the Western Football Association, the press, and the referees for their cooperation and support. The President of the Western Football Association, Green Shaw, and the representative of the British Army Football Team in Shanghai, Cody Hwa, also expressed their warm congratulations to the National Sports Association, the Malayan Football Team, and the Chinese Football Team.</p>
<p>Wishing Success: The Westerner Li Silian has a history of twenty years of overseas Chinese in Shanghai. He knows football very well. Therefore, he is the most experienced and has the deepest knowledge. He has a good impression of the Chinese football circle. He is now the honorary instructor of both the Jinan and Donghua football teams. He was very happy to talk and laugh at the meeting and said that if Jinan wins the Group A championship of the Western Football Association, Donghua wins the Senior Cup and the Scott Cup championship, and China wins the International Football Championship, it will be the supreme glory of your country's football circle. At the time of the speech, he seemed to have infinite hope. Judging from the current situation, Mr. Li's words are not impossible. I hope the athletes will work hard and drink the Yellow Dragon, so as not to live up to the enthusiastic celebration of that night.</p>

<p>They don't approve of party rule, and they don't approve of Puyi being emperor. They say, "There is another true son of heaven somewhere."</p>
<p>A son was drawing black characters denouncing Japan on the moldy white wall of the visitor room. He was beaten by his father. The next day, the father hired a plasterer to plaster over the drawing, the father's justification being: "It's an eyesore, and disobeys instructions."</p>
<p>Some people say, "If there was a Li Hongzhang in China now, the current Sino-Japanese incident wouldn't have blown up into this."</p>
<h3 id="e157">Reading Painting Notes · Swallow <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The collaborative painting exhibition of the Three Friends of Winter, which has been brewing for a long time, was initiated by famous painters Zhang Shanzi, Wang Zhongshan, He Tianjian, Shang Shengbo, Zheng Wuchang, Xiong Songquan, Wang Shizi, Qian Shoutie, Ma Wanli, and Sun Xueni. Those who were invited to join include Shen Jianzhi, Zhu Shaoyue, Hong Shuan, Wang Ziyuan, Xu Xiaocun, and Wu Yifeng. Xue Baolun was elected to preside over the association's affairs. The exhibition was held in Room 311 on the third floor of New World. Every afternoon, landscape, flowers, birds, insects, figures, and animals were painted collaboratively. The period lasted only one week, and more than 170 fine works have already been painted. It is scheduled to be displayed in the left hall of New World on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th. The reporter followed up on the news and recorded what he saw and heard in the following.</p>
<p>Among the works, flowers, fruits, and animals are the most numerous, followed by landscapes and figures. They are all crystallization products of the painters. Xiong Songquan's giant lion was complemented by He Tianjian's mountain trees. The workmanship is equally matched. Fine landscape paintings include He Tianjian's imitation of Dong Ju, Zheng Wuchang's imitation of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, Shen Jianzhi's study of Wen Tang, Sun Xueni's imitation of Shu Mei, Wang Zhongshan's imitation of Ma Yuan, Qian Shoutie's imitation of Da Chi, and Xu Xiaocun's study of Dai Xi. They all have unique features.</p>
<p>Flowers, birds, vegetables, and fruits, such as Shang Shengbo, Wang Shizi, Ma Wanli, Hong Shuan, Ye Weixin, etc., are all lifelike and fragrant, and are highly regarded in the art world.</p>
<p>Among those who paint animals in Shanghai, Zhang Tiger and Xiong Lion are highly recommended. Those who get their works of art cherish them like treasures. Little do they know that Xiong is proficient in all kinds of animals. Yesterday, I saw the white ape painted by Xiong, complemented by Xue Ni's red trees and Wanli's yellow wisteria and bees. It was extremely exquisite. So I jokingly inscribed it: Dreaming of becoming a marquis is a delusion. After offering the heavenly book, I turned to think. Why not pick the fruits on the branches? I want to send the autumn red to someone. Then I asked Shen Jianzhi to write it. Shanzi and Tianjian collaborated on Rouge Tiger, which is the most precious and not easy to obtain at ordinary times.</p>
<p>On the sixth day, the master of the poetry circle, Xie Yucen, came to visit. Seeing the painting of Fanzhou Tu painted by Xue Ni, he wrote a poem: Carrying wine, the river tide is wide with drunk eyes. The snow-covered reeds connect to the cold sky. If the rainbow is asked about the past, there may be two ordinary girls playing the flute. The words are very similar to Yang Tieya's. It is indeed a good work.</p>
<p>He Tianjian is famous for his landscape paintings. The benevolent daughter never easily puts her pen to paper. However, whenever she feels inspired, she paints a jade face with hanging temples, which is not inferior to Yuhu Danxu, and is even more beautiful and elegant. The painted lady is extremely beautiful in appearance and extraordinary in charm. Wanli filled in a pear tree for it, and I asked him to fill in a small order. I then wrote it as if in a dream: The courtyard is slightly cold and windy, reporting that the pear blossoms are in bloom. With low temples, I think carefully, with thousands of sorrows lingering. Who expected? Who expected? The news is now finally gone.</p>
<p>Wang Shizi is famous for his flower, bird, insect, and fish paintings. The night before yesterday, when I saw Wu Yifeng coming, I suddenly became interested, so I cooperated with Wu to paint a landscape painting. Wang painted the pine trees and hillsides, and Wu filled in the distant mountains. It was just like seamless, and I wrote a poem: The sky is full of clouds pressing down on the mountains, and thousands of peaks and valleys look lost. When the wind is calm and the sun is setting, the sound of the pines is quiet. Someone is walking westward over the bridge with a stick.</p>
<p>Others, such as the New Year's painting, He Tianjian's pine, Qian Shoutie's plum, and Shang Shengbo's peony, are all precious works. It is rare to cooperate at ordinary times. It is said that there are five or six frames, which can be said to be a grand event.</p>

<p>A Self-Description by Movie Star Hu Die:</p>
<p>A Story: While still producing White Cloud Tower, Mr. Hong Shen introduced two actresses. They all had very sincere intentions, strong interest, and a physique suitable for the film industry, as well as other qualities. Mr. Hong meant for them to first visit our actual work to understand some of the work's procedures and methods. Then they could formally begin their own work. They all happily agreed. The first day, the time our shooting work started was at 7 p.m. But before 5 p.m., they had already arrived, waiting without disappointment for those free two hours to pass. They carefully watched me do my makeup, and carefully watched me following Mr. Director's orders, doing this, doing that. The lights were so strong that my eyes felt pricked. The acting was trivial and demanding in a way that annoyed people. The camera made a hypnotic, detestable sound. Everything about the working people—their smiles and actions—had no freedom. This puppet show was much more difficult to stage. At the very least, in the minds of those two, this is how they began to feel. Otherwise, why would they have excused themselves to leave in a hurry because of the lateness of the hour when our work hadn't finished? From tomorrow on, and until now, they haven't paid us another visit. According to Mr. Hong: "They're chickens who know how to do a hundred somersaults!" The stimulation of the story mentioned above isn't my ridicule toward others. It's my stimulation of myself. Although I was an ordinary actor then, I often heard Mr. Zhang Shichuan giving us instruction. He said, "The Chinese film profession is so chaotic. Although there have been some bright sprouts in the past seven or eight years, they are often attacked by a certain kind of dark force. Since we have determined our upward goal, we must work hard to build a solid foundation for the film industry. Speaking of hard work, it's not to say that one person works hard. Everyone must work hard. Everyone must not be afraid of sacrifice. Even if we ourselves can't achieve success, the road to success can eventually allow later generations to find the images we left behind." Therefore, several times I felt discouraged because I felt trapped, and several times I learned to be disappointed because of the unfortunate criticism in society. But in the end, I can muster up our spirits to look forward to future success.</p>

<p>Third Episode: Yu and Liang Arrive Together, Causing the Feast to Dissolve; Yin the Minister Avoids Them, But Who Abandoned the Jeweled Box? (17)</p>
<p>Hearing that someone named Li was calling, An Yutian hurriedly and unsteadily walked out, abruptly leaving behind Liang Xiaoyun, his close friend at the table, without even saying goodbye. He quickened his pace and rushed to the telephone in the office. He saw an earpiece taken off the phone and hung on a small nail nearby, so he took it, put it to his ear, and spoke into the mouthpiece, asking, "Where are you calling from? Is this Normal University? Are you Miss Li?" He then heard a very clear voice from the earpiece saying, "Yes, this is Wenxia. Is this Yutian?" An Yutian quickly replied, "This is Yutian. Oh, Wenxia, I haven't seen you for days. How are you? I'm sorry, I was busy and didn't have time to visit you. I appreciate you calling first." After saying this, his heart started pounding, as if his words were insincere and he felt guilty for lying. Li Wenxia then answered on the phone, "I already know a little about your situation. Teacher Wei, Wei Zhuomou, just told me. I was very shocked, so I quickly called to ask you what exactly happened. How could such an unfortunate tragedy occur in your home?" Upon hearing this, An Yutian secretly marveled. This Mr. Wei really had nothing better to do than deliver messages for me everywhere. It wasn't enough that he brought Liang Xiaoyun, but he immediately went to disturb Miss Li. Fortunately, Miss Li wasn't as impatient as Liang Xiaoyun and didn't come straight to my apartment, which was my good luck. So, he solemnly replied, "That's how it is. But I can't say the details and the solutions for now. I must wait for my uncle An Dakui's second letter. Thank you for your concern. I'm very grateful. But I'm in a state of chaos and feel very weak because of this sudden disaster. Let me rest for a while, and I will visit you there tomorrow to discuss it in detail." He didn't expect that these words wouldn't work as an excuse. Instead, Li Wenxia's voice on the phone became even higher and crisper, saying, "No, I'm worried. I want to see you right away. Wait for me, I'm hiring a car now. We'll talk when we meet later!" Then, with a snap, the earpiece was hung up, leaving An Yutian no chance to speak or stop her. The line was cut. Helpless, he stood there blankly, holding the earpiece, dazed for a while. Suddenly, he remembered that Li Wenxia would come as soon as she said she would. From the dormitory of the Normal University to here, even in the slowest rickshaw, would only take at most half an hour.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Financial and Gold Markets Fluctuate Greatly <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Excess Cash... Shorts Can Enter</p>
<p>Quiet Long Enough to Want Movement, Rebound Weak by Four Tael</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold price showed great volatility and a chaotic situation. The rise and fall were irregular, with a total difference of thirteen taels throughout the day. Dealers were at a loss and unsure of their positions. The market was strange and unpredictable, truly a case of being quiet long enough to want movement, with a final rebound of about four taels.</p>
<p>The market opened high, rising immediately, probably because a large order unexpectedly fell back. Although the silver price remained unchanged, it did not prevent the market from breaking through six hundred and ninety taels. As foreign exchange tightened initially and then loosened, coupled with major players and long positions vying to sell, and the trend of declining cash, the market sentiment suddenly turned weak, plummeting ten taels and breaking eighty taels. In the afternoon, news of debt defaults emerged, triggering a selling spree, almost a complete collapse, breaking eighty taels again. Subsequently, a deficit in foreign exchange bills led to a rebound. Zhifeng Yong and speculator Wu, etc., rushed to buy, and shorts rushed to cover, resulting in an extremely sharp market with a rapid rise of more than ten taels, suddenly breaking ninety taels. The surge was unstoppable, likely due to short positions being taken advantage of, caused by excess cash, so the exchange's registered prices for all months have become uniform.</p>
<p>Opened High, Plunged Before Noon Closing</p>
<p>Opened five taels higher at six hundred and eighty-nine taels. A large order suddenly decreased by one-eighth. The silver price remained the same, but private telegrams rose by one-sixteenth, which did not affect the market. Subsequently, Wanxing, Tong Taichang, Shunli, and others sold, dropping from six hundred and ninety taels to eighty-seven and a half. Suddenly, buyers became enthusiastic, such as Yuanheng, Hengyu, Yuan Maoyong, Benshichangxiang, Dadecheng, etc., all entering. The initial price of British gold was one shilling ten pence six two five, later five six two five, a jump of four taels to six hundred and ninety-one taels nine qian. Soon after, Yuanmao, Tong Taichang, Hengxing, Chunyuanyong, Shunmao, Yuhe, etc., came to sell, retreating three taels. The opening price of British gold remained unchanged, around six hundred and eighty-nine taels. The internal盘 price of US dollars was one shilling ten pence six two five, followed by a head of one tael or so, from six hundred and eighty-eight taels eight qian to nine taels eight qian. After nine thirty, the foreign exchange market eased, especially with a drop in red notes by only five and a half taels, with few buyers. The selling frenzy on the trading floor, Qian Changxiang, Yuan Chun, Biaofengcheng, Shun Maoyongfeng, Heng Xingyuan, Heng Changyong, Datong, and other banks, were mostly selling off. The bank's buying price for US dollars was thirty-three yuan, and for British gold, one shilling ten pence six two five, resulting in a sudden drop in gold prices, plummeting ten taels until eleven o'clock to six hundred and seventy-nine taels eight qian. Subsequently, Hengxing, Yuanchun, Yuankangxiang, Tong Taichang, Chengdayong, Tongchun, Jinfengyong, Yuandayong, etc., all reduced their positions. Heng Xingyuan also returned to buy. As the US dollar banks absorbed at thirty-two yuan eight seven five, the market suddenly rose, reaching six hundred and eighty-four taels five qian at eleven fifty. It then decreased slightly, about one or two taels, until noon closing at six hundred and eighty-three taels five qian, and was re-priced at four and a half taels, with a listing price still at seven hundred and fifty taels, with a pressure of sixty to seventy taels. Noon closing was sixty-five to sixty-six taels.</p>
<p>Post-Market Change is Endless, Intriguing</p>
<p>The post-market opened at eighty-four taels two qian, then at five taels two qian, immediately returning to two taels eight qian, and at two ten to four taels two qian. However, various firms had little activity. Around two thirty, a storm suddenly arose, due to rumors of Germany defaulting on war debts and reparations, fearing unexpected actions, causing panic. Fuxingyong, Xiexingyong, Yuan Maoyong, Yuhe, Hong Kangyong, etc., all sold, selling US dollars to banks, calculated at thirty-three yuan, and British gold at one shilling ten pence seven five, causing the gold price to plummet more than five taels, reaching seventy-eight taels five qian at three o'clock. Afterwards, the situation seemed to ease. Zhifengyong, etc., bought, adding more than three taels, to eighty-two taels, and then one tael again, until three thirty, when Zhifengyong, Xiexingyong, Yuhe, Dadecheng, Qian Changxiang, and even those who had sold, urgently rushed to buy back. Examining the reasons for the sudden rise, it was due to the improvement in foreign exchange bills. Banks absorbed one-month British gold at one shilling ten pence seven five, forward six eight seven five, and US dollars could be settled at thirty-two yuan six two five to five six two five. Fuchang, etc., all stopped selling and switched to buying, which stimulated the market. The gold price soared eleven taels, and Wu worked hard to push it, reaching six hundred and ninety-two taels at four twenty, exceeding the highest price of the early market, truly an unimaginable change. However, Yuan Maoyong, Qian Changxiang, etc., took this opportunity to sell, causing the price to fall sharply by more than three taels, retreating to six hundred and eighty-eight taels five qian, immediately adding one and a half taels, until the market closed at four thirty at eighty-eight taels eight qian, up three taels eight qian from the previous day, a small reversal of the previous two days. The highest of the day was ninety-two taels, the lowest seventy-eight taels five qian, a difference of thirteen taels five qian. The goods market opened at eighty-nine taels in the early market, noon closing at four taels five, afternoon at four taels five, and closing at eight taels half. The quoted price was approximately seventy taels to sixty taels. Registered accounts for January, February, and March were the same at six hundred and eighty-four taels, afternoon at eighty-nine taels, water subsidy at six hundred and eighty-four taels, afternoon at eighty-nine taels. Red notes increased by only five taels five qian, with buyers hesitating. Only spot firms traded among themselves at seventy taels.</p>
<p>Extremely Complex Over-the-Counter Transactions</p>
<p>Statistics</p>
<p>Qian Changxiang, Yuan Maoyong, Tong Taichang, Chengdayong, Yifengyong, Dadecheng all entered. Yuan Tai, Yuan Dayong, Yuanheng, Hengyu, Yuankangxiang, Hengxing, Heng Xingyuan, Yuanchun etc. were coming and going. Yuanmao, Shunmao, Chunyuanyong all sold thousands of bars. Yuhe, Fu Taiheng, Fuchang, Hong Kangyong, Taifengcheng, Yongfeng, Heng Changyong all sold. In the afternoon, Tong Taichang, Hong Kangyong, Fuxingyong, Fuchang, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuan Maoyong all sold. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Yuanheng, Zhi, Feng Yong all entered. Qian Changxiang entered and exited again. Yuhe Xiexingyong sold and re-entered. Other firms were quite divergent. Speculator Wu bought in the afternoon, with the Dalian gang selling over five hundred bars and buying over three hundred and ten bars. The Guangdong gang only had two to three hundred bars in and out.</p>

<p>British-American Tobacco Company Has Settlements</p>
<p>Transactions Can Be Said to Be Lively</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British silver suddenly fell, while the American silver remained unchanged. The market was stable.

As for copper coins, there were rumors that banks were still absorbing them, so the trend gradually rose. The early market was seven qian one fen seven li two hao half, the noon market was seven qian one fen seven li seven hao half. As a result, the early market was higher by a total of one li one hao two hu half than the previous day.

<h3 id="e164">Securities and Bond Markets Still See Large Fluctuations <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Results Show Mutual Rise and Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday (21st), the trading situation on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange showed large fluctuations in market prices and active trading sentiment. Futures trading for the next month remained active, but spot trading was slightly sparse. As for the trend of various bond prices, such as the Unified Salt Tax, Whole Six, Customs Tax, etc., the prices had fallen significantly, lower than other bonds. Except for an initial drop of about six or seven jiao due to market sentiment in the early morning, they then stabilized. The various盘 面s hovered and showed little change. As a result, they rebounded about half a yuan compared to the previous day. Salt Tax spot prices even rose by one yuan one jiao, while others saw greater fluctuations. When they opened in the early morning, market sentiment was quite weak, due to news that the government was going to reorganize the bonds. If this were to become a reality, the principal repayment period would be extended and the interest rate would be reduced. As a result, market sentiment was not strong. For high-priced bonds, people were selling off, and prices fell sharply. For example, the demobilization of troops for the next month was almost suspended from trading due to excessive declines, and the rest also fell by about three yuan each. The second盘 面 remained weak, with slight fluctuations. The situation in the afternoon market was slightly better. There were many who bought in at low prices in the market, so the rebound was quite strong. For example, the demobilization of troops, the 19th Customs Duty, etc., were higher than in the early morning. As a result, many still continued to fall. Among them, the demobilization of troops in February fell by three yuan, the 19th Customs Duty for February fell by two yuan four jiao, the January fell by one yuan four jiao, the demobilization of troops and the 19th Customs Duty spot were about four yuan lower, and the 20th volume fell by one yuan. Others only had changes of about half a yuan. It is now observed that the prices of various bonds are gradually trending towards uniformity, falling to about 30 yuan. The trend is expected to temporarily stabilize. It is estimated that the total spot trading for the day was 47,000 yuan, and the futures trading was more than 5.6 million in the morning market and 3.6 million in the afternoon market, totaling 9.26 million yuan.

<p>The yarn market is calm, but the overall trend is relatively strong. Because the national situation is unstable and the violent sun is harassing the Northeast severely, people's hearts are relatively anxious, silver is difficult to loosen, and the settlement period is approaching, all industries have the act of closing accounts, so the situation is very stable. There is a real need for the Dian帮 (Yunnan merchants) to initiate procurement, and the Shu帮 (Sichuan merchants) have already stopped. Yarn and cloth will stop gathering from February 3 and open on the 10th, it is said.</p>
<p>People's Biao多头 (long positions) Settle</p>
<p>The exchange's people's biao opened in the early market, with a slight drop in American cotton and a lack of buyers in the market. Each month fell by 1.2 qian.

<p>The cotton market is trending firm, and the overall situation is relatively strong. Although American cotton is flat, Indian cotton prices are high, which makes people feel firm. This month, India intends to receive goods at high prices, and some yarn mills have switched from settling Indian cotton to buying this cotton. And the source from various routes is lacking, so the market sentiment is gradually tight. However, some空方 (short positions) still have a hard attitude and are unwilling to cover, and Ningbo merchants are extremely determined to go long, it is said.</p>
<p>汉标 (Han Biao) Frequently Rises Four Qian Five Fen</p>
<p>The exchange's汉标 (Han Biao) opened in the early market with American cotton flat, but the Ningbo merchants were buying in the market, and the market sentiment was particularly tight. Each month rose by 1.2 qian. The market sentiment was still rising in the afternoon, rising again by 1.2 qian. The total transaction statistics for the day were 75,200 dan.

<p>Only High-Priced Goods are Relatively Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of goods from various gangs in Shanghai South was still small, and there were few stocks in the Pujiang area. The route to the street was slightly smooth. Top-grade Su Changbai japonica rice was still lacking. The Zhongguan overnight rice rose in price due to brisk sales. Ping Li Bai japonica rice had brisk sales in both rural areas and retail, and large orders increased by several points. Qingxin早稻 (early rice) market was lively, with high-priced goods tight and low-priced goods weak. Yangdu top-grade rice was rare and the market was stable. Yesterday, the Taikoo company's ship brought 400 tons of number one Saigon rice and 600 tons of small-ground rice. The goods were stacked in the foreign warehouse and have not yet opened for trading, it is said.</p>
<p>The source of goods from more than forty stores in Xinzha襄 Road was very light. Top-grade Chang帮 (Changzhou merchants) goods arrived strongly, and the price was soft by two jiao. The inland糙粳 (coarse rice) market continued to decline, and local sentiment turned 淡 (weak). Because shops on both sides are closing accounts for the Xia Li New Year, early and late稻 (rice) scattered and did not move, the price was fatigued by one or two jiao. Top-grade埠杜尖 (port dujian) goods were few, and the price remained the same. Bianyuan yin 化 (化 : liquidating)酒 (liquor)胃 (stomach: appetite) was sluggish, and the trend was downstream.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there was some local trading of foreign rice to meet immediate needs, but transactions were very light. The entire market only opened with small lots of 500 bags, priced at $9.75 to $9.70. There was little trading of returned goods. Foreign firms continued to sell, making the market even more sluggish. It is estimated that 1,000 tons of small quantities for April delivery were newly traded at a price of 4 taels and 6 mace and 5 candareens, sold by Anli. Yuanli also sold 1,000 tons of No. 1 Saigon rice for April delivery at a price of 5 taels, 2 mace, and 8 candareens. There are still telegrams for 4,000 tons of Saigon rice for February, March, and April delivery, which may also be traded today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Taizhou rice is welcomed in the market because of the lack of early indica rice. Yesterday, a new batch of Taizhou rice arrived, including 500 bags of Taizhou white rice, priced at $10.085 to $10.02, and 500 bags of Taizhou [unclear] rice, priced at $10.04 to $9.90, all of which were purchased by local merchants, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market generally showed a fluctuating trend for all months. The quoted price of foreign wheat rose slightly by 12-13 cents. The sentiment of outsiders seemed to be slightly stable, but because factories continued to import foreign wheat, they all considered waiting for an opportunity to sell. In addition, with the Lunar New Year approaching, many outside investors were more focused on recovering debts, so transactions were few and prices were slightly weak. However, due to the ability of major factory owners to withdraw cash, the market sentiment for this month was slightly better. As a result, this month was 5 li better than the previous day, February and March were slightly 5 li better, April was 2.5 li better, May was slightly 2.5 li better, and June was 5 li better, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Wheat Prices Showed Little Change <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market generally showed a fluctuating trend. Due to rumors that more than ten cars of wheat from Jiangbei were awaiting delivery this month, market sentiment remained poor and continued to decline. The distant May contract showed little change due to very few transactions. Observing the future trend, if foreign wheat is no longer traded and the amount of sales decreases, this market value can be sustained. As a result, this month fell 2 fen compared to the previous day, February rose 2 fen, March and April had no comparison, May rose slightly 2 fen, and June remained unchanged, it is said.</p>

The price of Java spot sugar continued to fluctuate. Trading on the local public market was sparse, but market sentiment remained firm.

Fine Dutch white sugar was 11 taels and 7 mace, and Dutch No. 8 red sugar was 8 taels and 3 mace and 5 candareens, and the market was relatively stable. Tai Koo Sugar B Mark was 11 taels and 7 mace and 5 candareens, with more than 100 bags traded. The seller was calling for higher prices in the afternoon, and the trend was still strong.

<p>The output of Jinshan branches this year has been very good, so other miscellaneous goods have been showing fatigue and falling prices. Only this kind of goods has a stable trend. The goods are sold domestically as soon as they arrive, and there is not much inventory. But it only fell a little bit. The incoming goods are running out of stock, and the price has turned up again. According to people in the industry, the goods are running low. The goods are still stored in the place of origin, and the number is also limited. They are temporarily not being shipped to Shanghai. They plan to wait for the spring market to rise sharply before loading them for the market. At present, there are still many Zhang branches, but because the goods are not very suitable for sales, they are still falling, it is said.</p>

<p>British tinplate has not arrived for a long time, and the market trend is quite strong. However, more than 11,000 boxes of spot goods arrived at the Dagu Machine in Pudong yesterday.

It is found that the current market price per box is only 10 taels, which has fallen by 1 mace and 5 candareens compared with the previous price. It is feared that this kind of spot goods will circulate in the market in the future, and the standard may have to return to weakness.</p>

<h3 id="e177">The Fortunate Riot of Japanese Ronin <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Since the incident in the eastern provinces, the Japanese have repeatedly attempted to riot in Shanghai. Finally, it suddenly broke out the other day. The Sanyou Industrial Society towel factory in Yinxiang Port was destroyed, and the doors and windows of shops on North Sichuan Road were smashed. Chinese police were killed, and pedestrians were beaten. Such acts of murder and arson were openly committed within our country's territory. Moreover, after the arson, they even convened a meeting of residents to resolve to request the government to earnestly protect the lives and property of residents and the legitimate rights of Japan, and to request the Japanese naval landing force to be responsible for prevention. In our country, people are allowed to run rampant, and the country has not yet perished. The lives of citizens are not guaranteed at all. We want to ask where our government has gone. Where have our 450 million citizens gone!</p>
<p>If the Japanese kill and burn, China can only watch them kill and burn and resign ourselves to fate. From Korea to Tianjin to Qingdao, they kill and burn everywhere and riot everywhere, echoing the brutal army in the northeast. Now they have killed and burned in Shanghai. In the future, they will advance to Nanjing and every city, and tragic scenes of killing and burning can occur anytime and anywhere. Countrymen, touch your heads, do you have any guarantee? Will you still be calm? Will you still wait for death? Do you still think that the fall of the Northeast has nothing to do with you?</p>
<p>The disaster in the Northeast has been going on for more than four months, and the government only tells us to endure and only tells us to wait for death. It neither fights, defends, nor makes peace. It bows to the spirit tablet of the League of Nations every day to beg for help. From the Tianjin riot, the Fuzhou incident, the Qingdao incident, to the current tragedy in Shanghai, the government can only watch with its eyes open, at most issue a "protest" as usual. What is the use of such a mediocre and incompetent government?</p>
<p>Recently, in the memorial draft that Honjo Shigeru presented to the Japanese Emperor, it was said: "The Chinese government has long become a non-responsive, incomplete political system. Although Chiang Kai-shek is very clever, his national thinking is still unsound. The so-called northward recovery of lost territory is nothing but stinking propaganda and has no effect. As for Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin, they all have no real strength and no national concept. Zhang Xueliang, with his fine wine and women, is even less worthy of mention... In short, the Chinese government is really not worth worrying about." How bold and cold and venomous these words are! Government officials, listen to them!</p>
<p>The government is so incompetent and irresponsible, so resisting violence and defending against insult, saving the country and saving ourselves, all depends on us rising up to take action, organizing our own armed forces, thoroughly rejecting Japanese goods, and the people themselves announcing the severance of diplomatic relations with the Japanese, with the determination to die for the survival of the nation. Only in this way can we save the country and save ourselves. Nationalists with blood, rise up!</p>

<p>The article "Rich People, Please Turn Back!" by Uncle Ming in yesterday's supplement touched my poetic impulse, and I actually composed several short poems. But there is one statement, please don't misunderstand the rich, it's not that I, a poor man, intend to joke with the rich, but just offer a small opinion, with absolutely no other malicious intentions, know me and blame me, it's all up to you, I'll write this poem below:</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Behind vermilion gates, meat rots,</p>
<p>On the road, bones freeze to death!</p>
<p>The gap between rich and poor is so vast,</p>
<p>Who says it's all the same?</p>
<p>Raise the banner of revolution,</p>
<p>The rich tremble!</p>
<p>The rich tremble,</p>
<p>And still dare to be stubborn?</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Ragged cloth and rotten cotton,</p>
<p>Wrap the body tightly.</p>
<p>Ignite the fire of life,</p>
<p>Burning straight at the rich!</p>
<p>Nowhere to go,</p>

<p>Where can the rich escape,</p>
<p>Quickly handcuff and shackle them!</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Why are the rich so rich?</p>
<p>Their hearts are worse than dogs!</p>
<p>Desperately accumulating family wealth,</p>
<p>Not letting go of a single cent.</p>
<p>Sitting and waiting for family ruin and death,</p>
<p>Why not save the country and save friends?</p>
<p>Save the country and save friends,</p>

<p>First dissolve yellow wax and place it on the glass, making sure it is flat. After it dries, use a needle on the yellow wax to write or draw whatever you want, keeping the needle tip close to the glass.</p>
<p>Once the engraving process is complete, take a tin or copper container (do not use a porcelain basin) and take a small amount of silver stone powder and acid powder, purchased from a pharmacy, and mix them in the basin. At that time, a chemical reaction will occur and it will dissolve involuntarily.</p>
<p>While this is happening, take the engraved glass and place the yellow wax side over the medicine basin. After a short time, take it up, peel off the yellow wax, and the glass with the engraved words and pictures will be finished.</p>

<p>Gambling is almost the main entertainment of "city dwellers". Mahjong, poker, pai gow, dice, betting on flower meetings, guessing poetry riddles in hotels, clubs, and so-called "villas," all kinds of endless and countless patterns, all night long, night after day, is already unnecessary to say, that is, on any road, in any alley, if you are happy, you can find gambling entertainment at any time. Various "entertainments" are absolutely open and unbridled, especially for underage children. It almost seems to be recognized as a "legitimate" and "excellent" "early childhood education."</p>
<p>On the road or at the entrance of an alley, we can almost always see an old man with a sallow complexion or a child carrying a wooden frame. A wooden plate on the frame displays some chicken eggs, preserved plums, and sugar, etc. Another bowl contains four dice. You drop a copper coin and can throw the dice. Of course, your opponent is the owner of the wooden plate. If you roll a "one" and your opponent rolls a "two," you lose. Conversely, you win and can get three pieces of sugar or a chicken egg. If your gambling purpose is money rather than food, according to the rules, "one pays three," that is, you only lose one coin, but he pays you three.</p>
<p>There is also the same wooden frame, with a plate on the frame painted with red, black, and white markings. The owner of the wooden plate holds three round cardboard pieces of red, black, and white in his hand and quickly shuffles them back and forth, constantly shouting, "Look, look clearly!" He quickly covers a cardboard piece under a bowl, and then the surrounding gamblers bet and guess. If the red cardboard is covered under the bowl, and you bet on red, you win. According to the rules, it is also "one pays three."</p>
<p>There is also a child carrying a wooden board on his back, with round holes arranged on the board. Some holes contain a piece of sugar, a cigarette, or a few peanuts, but most are empty. The holes are all sealed with paper. You drop a copper coin and can arbitrarily poke a hole. Whatever is in the hole is your prize. If there is nothing in the hole, the copper coin is sacrificed in vain.</p>
<p>There are also shooting targets with air guns, drawing sugar, various patterns, different everywhere, but everywhere.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a world of gambling. Many people use it as a livelihood, many people use it as entertainment, and for most people, they regard it as legitimate "social education" or "early childhood education."</p>

<p>It was in the afternoon the other day! I happened to pass by the City God Temple and saw something that I found very interesting, so I made a note of it and shared it with the readers of the local supplement; it can also give you an idea of the psychology of the average young man!</p>
<p>The fact is this...</p>
<p>"Sir! Fortune and blessing, savior of suffering! Please have pity on me, I haven't had anything to eat all day, give me a copper coin!" A pitiful-looking beggar woman followed a young man wearing a very handsome western-style coat, crying and saying as she followed.</p>
<p>"Go away, go further away!" The young man answered harshly, walking his way without turning his head, but the beggar woman still called, "Sir, sir," following him for a long way. I looked at this situation and was very unhappy. I thought, can't this young man spare even a copper coin? Or perhaps he didn't have any copper coins with him? It was also possible...</p>
<p>I was guessing wildly when suddenly I saw this young man take a large handful of copper coins out of his purse, about a dozen or twenty, and with a rustling sound he threw them into the beggar woman's broken basket... Then I heard him say...</p>
<p>"You people with no clothes and no food are so pitiful!... Go, go." And so this beggar woman bent over and left with a thousand thanks.</p>
<p>"Ah, strange!" I was stunned by him. This young man was so stingy before, he was simply someone who wouldn't give up a single hair; why is he now generously giving away wealth? This puzzle is really difficult to solve!</p>
<p>Dear readers! Do you think it's strange? Haha, it turned out to be like this;</p>
<p>It turned out that two fashionable women were coming in front, their clothes were extremely fashionable and gorgeous. When this young man saw them, he took the opportunity to pretend to be generous and charitable to show them, actually sacrificing a dozen or twenty copper coins, and even saying some sickeningly kind words, which could be considered a great show of himself!</p>
<p>I turned back to look at those two women again, and sure enough, they looked at this young man, and seemed to approve of his actions as "rare and valuable!"</p>
<p>"Ah! The psychology of young people is originally like this." I couldn't help but exclaim again at the time</p>
<p>Ah!</p>

<p>× Government Troops Attack the County Seat</p>
<p>Although the Su-Song-Tai Daotai escaped into the concession under the protection of foreigners, he feared being charged by the Qing court with the serious crime of losing the city and dereliction of duty, so he planned to recover the city. At that time, government troops were stationed near the Suzhou River near the New Gate Bridge. It would not have been difficult to capture the city, but the foreigners in the concession provided a lot of assistance to the Small Swords Society, and the supplies were very abundant, so they could not be captured for a while.</p>
<p>Wu Jianzhang purchased a small boat, equipped it with small cannons, and led several warships from Songjiang to bombard the city on the twelfth, hoping to destroy the city walls, but the firepower was too weak and ultimately ineffective.</p>
<p>Government troops learned that the Small Swords Society had purchased and stored a large number of munitions in a foreign firm in the concession, so they decided to rush into the concession to seize these munitions. They dispatched a small team of government troops to rush to the customs to retrieve the munitions, but several sailors from the British warship "Spartan" came to stop them, and they were unable to retrieve them.</p>
<p>The Su-Song-Tai Daotai wanted to use the power of the foreigners in the concession to drive the Small Swords Society out of the city, but the foreigners were enjoying the "watching the fire from the other side" and secretly assisted the Small Swords Society quite a bit, so they took the pretext of neutrality and did not help. In fact, this attitude of neutrality was unreliable. For commercial reasons, foreigners still traded with both sides as usual.</p>
<p>The battlefield between the government troops and the Small Swords Society was close to the western part of the concession, and stray bullets often flew into the boundary, causing great panic among the residents. Renji Hospital on Shandong Road, founded by Dr. Lockhart, was in the line of fire, but fortunately it was spared from looting. The wounded soldiers on both sides were sent to the hospital for treatment. Foreigners going to West Shanghai were often beaten by soldiers, and the area around the New Park and the Racecourse (now Lloyd Road) became a dangerous area.</p>
<p>× Founding the Merchant Corps</p>
<p>At that time, government troops were stationed in barracks along the Suzhou River, and the Small Swords Society was in the city. Both sides' soldiers were dissatisfied with the foreigners. The imperialists in the concession wanted to take advantage of this good opportunity to expand the strength of the concession, so on the twelfth day of the fourth month of Xianfeng three years, they convened a general meeting of all residents. All the consuls and military officers of the three contracting countries, Britain, America, and France, attended. British Consul Alcock presided over the meeting and decided to implement armed neutrality, so they began to organize a merchant corps. They also appointed French military officer Tronchon, Colonel of the 2nd Battalion of Infantry, as commander, and began training that day. From then on, the imperialists had a solid military force within the concession to maintain their special interests.</p>

Now, due to the fact that the funeral of his three generations has not been buried, the heart of his son is uneasy. He intends to use the power of painting to widely connect with literary circles. Please send the collection address to Mr. Li Dingshi of the Huimin Company on Wangping Street. The fees will be sent immediately upon request.</p>
