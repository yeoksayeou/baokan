<h3>再論目前預防水災之重要彬</h3>
<p>昨日一評吾人旣己呼籲政府痛懲去年之鉅災急起預防洚水之再發矣今請再申言之</p>
<p>古者「善治水者不與水爭地。」蓋川壅必潰。要當疏之使通。故大禹疏九河導百川使水由地中行。而不徒事壅塞。今黃河河身。高出地面。長江江身。亦多淤墊。支河旣不能暢流。湖澤又不能瀦水。如洞庭河畔。淤洲竟可闢爲縣治。又如卾東之樊口。以軍閥圖謀私利。築堤拓田。江流至此一鎖。故今日而言治水。則疏導爲上。場防爲下。今并此下策。亦不從速積着手。斯眞爲最足以令人嘆息痛恨之現象</p>
<p>歷來築堤都在冬令澤竭之候蓋以春汛一至。即無法着手今時己夏季。月初漢口一帶又連日陰雨江水日高若再不迅速防禦遷延坐視則水勢日增搶救日難勢必至再罹鉅却仰首穹蒼徒喚奈何。</p>
<p>去歲災後。政府對於水利員司曾有懲戒之說事過境遷。亦遂擱置。往者己矣。獨是當前之事。己决不容再事蹉跎。彼負有水利專責者。爲刼後孑遺生命之所託。寳再不容忽視職責釀成大禍。葉楚傖氏本月廿三日爲運河工程在中央報告。有云。「凡事預防未然。當較易補救於事。後年來人民損失很多。我」</p>
<p>們惟有痛責自己。」實則責又奚益。懲去年之失。救當前之危。我人民即實蒙其惠矣。</p>
<p>目前除水災救濟會利用工賑。分段築堤外。各地農民己多自動興工築堤。如皖南皖北。農民自動將堤加高贛省沿江一帶刻亦動工但吾人認爲全國水道脈脈相關。宜通盤籌劃。而不應片段修築。各自爲謀。以鄰爲壑。故政府亟應集中專家。精密測量。孰宜疏通。孰宜堤防。權其緩急。分别動工。政府倡導。人民自無不踴躍贊助。集全國之力量共從事於防水。水固不足防也。</p>
<p>總之。去年鉅刼。時尙未遠。吾人所得敎訓。應亦尙未淡忘過去之失。即今日寳貴之經騐。依此經騐以努力。應不至重蹈過去之覆轍重鑄無可挽救之大錯。</p>
<p>至於現有之水災委員會。此時尤應加緊工作。時己夏令。災地疾疫。固應預防。未來水患。亦應設計挽救。救災不必在災後。災前如能盡一分預防之力其效力實十倍於災後之救濟也。</p>

<p>國民社二十四日柏林電　自普魯士新議議選出後、一般人即預料將爲德國内政上風潮之新中心點、今果不出所料、本日甫舉行成立會議半小時、己連續發生紛擾數次、一若對於未來之大騷亂先示端倪者然、德國人民有鑒於此、故對新議會非常注意、旁聽席上遠在開會前、早己座無隙地、　旁聽者目光當然皆集中於國家社會黨之議席、但該黨議席初竟闐無一人、直至將開會時、一百六十二議員始整隊入塲、一時旁聽席中之歡呼相迎聲、與左派之譏笑聲、喧然並作、德廢皇第四皇子惠廉親王素稱國家社會主義運動健將、尤爲共產議員攻擊鵠的、今日新議會成立會由年高望重之國家社會黨議員李慈曼將軍主席、將軍年己八十四、爲東歐戰塲之名將、乃開幕禮甫畢、共產黨即立取攻勢提出不信任社會黨白朗總理之暫攝普内閣動議、又要求議會立即討論救濟失業問題、但兩項動議俱以手續上原因同遭否决、蓋議會决定須先舉出議長副議長與其他職員後、方能進行議事也、斯時共黨與國家社會黨立起猛烈爭辯、互相詆責欺騙失業者、迨兩項動議否决後、共產黨議員即聲稱、明日仍將提出同一動議、國家社會黨亦聲稱、該黨業己進備同樣動議、將於明日續開、選舉正副議長等、</p>
<h3>談判基於平等原則</h3>
<p>德外委會通過决議案</p>
<p>日内瓦會議將受影響</p>
<p>國民社二十四日柏林電　今日德國會外交委員會通過一重要决議案、料將於今後日内瓦會議之趨勢上、發生重大影響、在此案未决以前、德總理白魯寗曾對於軍縮會議與賠欵問題作甚長之演說、惟因會議情形嚴守秘密、白氏所言無從探悉、僅此决議案全文業己發表、内容堅决主張德國當竭其力之所能、謀將平等原則、用作日内瓦一切談判之基礎、聲稱、平等原則迄今僅具理論、此次必謀有以見諸實事、聞此案係國家社會黨提出、經巴伐利亞人民黨修正後、今日在委員會内一致通過、</p>
<h3>歐洲各國將與美政府</h3>
<p>簽訂分期償債協定</p>
<p>路透社二十五日紐約電　數外國政府連大不列顚在内、不日將與美政府簽定關於愆期戰債二萬五千二百萬元償還辦法之協定、按此欵即胡佛總統上年允延期十二個月者也、據紐約時報載稱、此欵將分十年償清、四釐起息、芬蘭希臘己簽字、德匈兩國則正在磋商中、其餘有關係各國尙未有正式來文、</p>
<p>要聞大阪每日新聞論日美戰機危迫</p>
<p>（三續）</p>
<p>去年九月、美國人所謂之「滿洲危機」（Manchuria　Crisis）勃發後、余極注視美國之行動、當時發見意想外之現象、即美國在此時公表其可異之意見、當是時中國向國際聨盟求援、而立於國際聨盟外以自主獨往之美國、竟宣言與國聨協力、同時與國聨結合、始終以壓迫日本之態度、評論滿洲問題、但明晰美國之外交家、對於美國政府如此之態度、不以爲異、以美國自大總统惠蘭特時代以至麥堅利時代、爲擁護自國利益、貫徹自國主張、每用强硬手段對外、例如大英帝國全盛時代、美國國務卿奥爾尼干涉加拉比亞海問題、與英外相沙利士培利相會時、其氣燄之凶張、不啻旁若無人、其結果卒不能屈服對方、此其一例也、</p>
<p>滿洲事變勃發時、史汀生之對日外交、以自居强國之地位、擁護自國傳統的立塲、向日提出通牒、惟其通牒内容、屬於勸告書之性質、蓋若日美兩國分離國際聨盟所謂之緩衝地帶、單獨處理滿洲事變、勢必發生正面衝突、故美國政府與其他政治家、多表示微温的態度、特美國與論界之論調、原可代表全美之意嚮、滿洲事變後、對日與論、甚不統一、其如英國孟却斯德指導報之侮蔑日本、恶言惡語、排斥日本者尙鮮、其中惟紐約晚報紐約世界新聞、則比較激烈、彼輩聞滿洲事變、即詆毁日本爲野蠻國、日本軍之行動、完全與野蠻人之行爲相類、甚至痛駡日本軍國主義之侵略政策、但他方亦有數家報紙、力爲日本辯護者、其後經濟封鎖問題發生、當時國中均以爲「對强國經濟封鎖、即爲誘發世界戰爭、」紐約新聞對此、亦分兩派主張、即一派鼓吹、一派反對、輿論旣不統一、政府之方針、遂難决定今余就個人見地、觀察美國情形、推想美國政府之眞意、其間大有罅隙存焉、何則、聽其聲明、讀其通牒、雖若强裝十分平靜穏和的語調、但其骨褻實含有壓迫之意、不滿之辭、溢乎言表、而尤爲國務卿史汀生常用之語調、在美國外交文書上、實開新奇之創例、蓋其傲岸不遜之言動、欲以壓迫隆崇威勢的世界、隠蔽自身之本然性、發揮可驚的自制力、己顯然無可隠蔽者也、</p>
<p>廻溯去年十月當美國海軍紀念日、上院海軍委員長、演講英美日三大海軍國之現狀、並比較美日兩國海軍之現有勢力、謂日本海軍力、比美國爲强、同時論及目前之滿洲事變、攻擊非難日本之滿洲政策、不遺餘力、中有因現今美國之海軍勢力、不能控制日本之行動爲恢等語、吾人由此可知美國今日、尙不敢積極干涉日本之行動、如欲干涉日本之行動、不得不引起戰爭、旣欲戰爭、不得有優勢之海軍力、而欲準備優勢之海軍、非一二個月所能辦、此美之所以虛張聲勢、徒作此威嚇手段也、而史汀生不明事理、聳恿挑撥、洵不值識者一笑耳、</p>

<h3>長江水漲奇速</h3>
<p>超過三十三英尺</p>
<p>近數日來、大雨不息、揚子江内水又大漲、武漢人心、己因之發生驚惶、邇日水勢更形升漲、漢口江面、己超過三十二英尺、與去年武漢大水災成一正比例、民心益形惶惑矣、詳情如下、</p>
<h3>漲水經過情形</h3>
<p>在本年四月初、江水尙不過十二三尺、到四月下旬、己漸增至十六英尺、五月份内、水漲最速、尤以五號至二十二日、此十七日中、共漲起十四英尺餘、而據海關水尺報告、五月五日水勢十八英尺六寸、六日十九尺五寸、七日二十尺八寸、八日二十尺三寸、九日二十一尺三寸、十日漲到二十三尺、十一日二十四尺二寸、十二日二十四尺六寸、十三日二十五尺六寸、十四日二十五尺九寸、十五日二十六尺五寸、十六日二十七尺四寸、十八日二十九尺六寸、十九日三十尺五寸、二十日三十一尺三、二十二日三十二尺、水量激漲在十二日以後之十天、每日幾增一尺、至昨日二十五日止、聞己漲到三十三英尺六寸矣、</p>
<h3>去歲水災回顧</h3>
<p>上年武漢水災、與今歲漲水如出一轍、亦在五月分起開端、查上年武漢江水、初本大淺、漢口九江武穴各處、僅在九尺十尺間、大輪不能通行、擱淺船至八九隻、直至五月、天忽大雨、江水突漲、五月三日、己漲到二十八尺八寸、至五月二十一日、更漲至三十五英尺、迨至七月中旬、水己與江面齊、八月二日、大水冲没武漢、市上亦積七八尺水、行人用划子往來、水勢逹五十三英尺六寸、沿江各埠、均淹入水内、釀成空前慘災、</p>
<h3>己逹上年水尺</h3>
<p>此會武漢江水、日夜大漲、而雨又不止、上流方面、差幸漲度不若去歲之速、漢口以上、猶得保持十六尺水標、不致下流再增、昨日、滬上某商行接得漢口來電、言二十四五兩天、漢口之水、其高度與上年同時、僅差尺餘、而去歲之水痕猶在、三鎭各界、鑒於此兩週中之逐日明增暗漲、人心大爲慌懼、蓋恐再經兩星期、仍如上兩週之激漲者、則水勢又將入市、上年之災、不難再見於今日、</p>
<h3>沿江碼棧築高</h3>
<p>各輪公司碼頭棧房、均在沿江、上年受水浸淫後、均將碼頭與棧房加高、以防大水之冲入、日來各輪公司、因漢口又發大水、業令輪行速度减少、以防激衝、方在修築之堤岸、同時又將棧房下層加築高堤、爲預防水災之工作矣</p>

<p>我急急忙忙把廟門鎖好跟着阿羊跑向村裏去救和尙。阿羊的家門口點養了幾根火把，我差不多走到大門口的時候就聽見有人喊：「把他們抬到城裏去。……那纔好看咧。……鐘兒來了。好，鐘兒！你進去看看你們大和尙幹的好事。」赤裸裸的兩個肉人捆做一團！一個是阿羊的奴媽，一個便是和尙。一幅鄉下捉姦圖活躍在我的面前。</p>
<p>和尙見是我來，便說：「好鐘兒！求求他們把我放了吧。」我脫下一件短衫蓋在他們身上，說：「我願意代你請求。」我能拒絶和尙的請求嗎？不能，斷斷乎不能。我向村友說：「讓他們在這裏停一刻，我們到茶館裏去談一」</p>
<p>談，看看有什魔辦法没有。」鐵匠老李建議，派兩個人站在這裏看守。大家同意，便到茶館裏去開談判。</p>
<p>我問：「你們預備怎樣辦？」</p>
<p>衆人說：「送縣！」</p>
<p>我問：「和尙是不是强姦？」</p>
<p>衆人說：「好幾年老夫妻了，你還不曉得，他們是多麽的恩愛！」</p>
<p>我問：「阿羊的媽媽有没有丈夫，今年是幾多歲了？」</p>
<p>鐵匠老李說：「阿羊的媽媽倒是一個可憐人，二十二歲就死了丈夫，現在」</p>
<p>是二十五歲了。」</p>
<p>我說：「律師趙公平先生一次到廟裏來玩·我請敎了他許多法律問題，他」</p>
<p>說無婦之夫與滿二十歲無夫之婦兩相情願要好並不算犯法。照這樣看來，你們就把和尙送縣，縣裏也决不能辨。弄到後來你們怕還要白費力氣白費錢呢。」</p>
<p>木匠老吳說：」誰願管這些閑事？這都是有人吃醋閙出來的呀！」</p>
<p>我說：「我們做事總要思前願後，不可亂來。」</p>
<p>衆人說：「照你看，這件事應該怎麽辦呢？」</p>
<p>我說：「照佛門規矩，旣做和尙，便不許娶妻，旣要娶妻，便不能做和尙」</p>
<p>。他旣情願要老婆，便不該再做和尙。我們可以在廟裏辦起一個學堂來使全村的小孩子都可以上學。如果他情願，我們可以劃十畝地給他們夫婦，只計自耕自吃，不許典賣與人。這他們將來也可成爲村中自食其力的人民。如果大家贊成，我就去對他說。」</p>
<p>衆人斟酌了一些時候，到最後，除了那個吃醋的磚匠老許，都以我這個計畫是一舉數得。</p>
<p>和尙是千肯萬肯。老李便解了他們的繩子結了這一段風流公案。後來，他與阿羊的媽媽正式結婚之後，我去吃他的喜酒，他還特别的感謝我，請我坐首席。</p>
<p>敵人變成朋友，古廟變成學校，這一切的一切都在幾小時中發現·那是多麽不可思議的事啊。</p>

<h3>茂萊擊落我國標槍紀錄</h3>
<p>美兵麥令斯田徑賽成績之特色</p>
<p>均與我國之最高紀錄相差無幾</p>
<p>六巨頭運動會將於下月初舉行、麥令斯爲考察成績起見、特於二十四日上午九時駐滬美兵麥令斯、假中華田徑塲舉行各營聨合運動會、第三營繼續保持錦標、得六十四分、亞軍爲第一營得五十六分、司令部殿軍得十八分、今請試觀其下列成績、</p>
<h3>史璜克名列冠軍</h3>
<p>第三營之史璜克氏、非特成績傑出、且得個人冠軍、共得三項第一、並破兩種紀錄、共獲十五分、個人第二爲「小寳貝」蘇登、乃中距離名將、得一千六百米及八百米兩第一、蜚聲海上之短跑名將湯史萊、其二百米爲阿拉特擊倒、與地格並列個人第三、</p>
<h3>擲標槍中國紀錄</h3>
<p>軍官茂萊、短小精悍、脅力過人、去年在上海田徑界中、己負盛譽、而此次之標槍比賽、茂萊突創其驚人之作、成績爲一百五十六呎二吋、第二名茀列諾之成績、亦逹一百五十呎九吋、非特爲上海之新紀錄、且爲我國全國之新成績、查我國最高紀錄爲温鼎新所造之四五米九○、合英尺僅一百五十呎六呎六分而己、</p>
<h3>短跑界兩雄爭逐</h3>
<p>馳譽己久之史湯萊、去年在滬之國際運動會中、自百米至四百米、均爲其包辦、惟此次二百米爲羅傑式足球名將阿拉特戰敗、阿氏之成績爲二四秒二、百米賽仍爲史氏第一、阿拉特發脚極快、顯然有史氏所不敵之槪、但阿拉特跑時、時回頭觀看他人、以致速率减低而爲史湯萊搶得冠軍、時間十一秒四、</p>
<h3>史璜克三項傑作</h3>
<p>史璜克亦有名於田徑界中、是日連獲撑竿跳跳遠三級跳三項田賽第一、撑竿跳並創上海新紀錄、成績十一呎一吋、打破其本人十一呎又四分之一吋之舊時最佳成績、雖尙不及我國符保盧之十一呎七吋（三米五四）、然目下我國選手恐難企及、又史氏之跳遠爲十九呎八吋、三級跳三十九呎五吋、</p>
<h3>鐵餅鉛球之特色</h3>
<p>此外如培克之十六磅鉛球、成績四十二呎九吋、亦爲我國最高紀錄所不及、地格之鐵餅爲一百十一呎七吋、與吾國張齡佳之三四米六三（一百十三呎七呎）及去年用連增三五米四十、（一百十六呎吋七）相差極微、</p>
<h3>其餘成績之一般</h3>
<p>高低俱屬平均、不足介紹、勃龍之四百米爲五十五秒二、葛洛夫之跳高爲五呎二吋四分这三、蘇登之八百米爲二分十二秒二頗不弱、又蘇登之一千六百米爲五分七砂八、</p>
<h3>我國選手亦愼防</h3>
<p>下月四日舉行之六巨頭運動會、麥令斯將握其最高威權、中青方面、雖己羅致全滬精銳、猶恐未可樂觀、跳躍部除撑竿跳外、我國可有希望、投擲部之第一、恐不爲我人所有、徑賽形勢相等、總之、麥令實爲中青之動敵、不可不預爲之防、</p>

<h3>麵店老人磨劍錄</h3>
<p>— 顧·明·道</p>
<p>麵店老人不詳其姓氏。姑以是名之。老人設肆於溝帮子。業十餘年矣。洲一惟錦州一勤勞。精神矍鑠。當九一八事變之後。倭取鐵騎蹂躪遼省殆温。惟錦隅尙爲我有。然日軍覬觀甚切。不復容我東北軍有立足之地以故調軍西進調軍西進。　躍欲試。溝帮子適當其衝。人民紛紛避入關内。老人所有資悉與其子媳。囑速他去。彼則獨留。子媳强請不得。含滬别去。老人絶無畏懼。開肆如常。間語人曰。東鄰倭奴封逐長蛇。薦食我國。守土者不能負其責。急於内戰。懦於禦侮。藉寇兵而齎盜糧。坐視敵騎西侵而莫之能抗。是委棄我東省人民於虎狼之口也。天下痛心之事。孰有過於此者。我老矣。國難當頭。何必避爲。倭奴若來。當有以創之。未幾錦州中立區之議未成。日軍果長福而入矣。溝邦子不旋踵即陷落。日軍旣至。老人設肆如故。且吸旱烟。鎭靜異常。有四五日軍入其肆。見而笑曰。此老較後生胆大多矣。若願爲我大日本之順民乎。當護汝勿殺。老人唯唯。日軍先命老人嘗食老人製麵。老人即棄烟袋。入製麵。盛以大碗。進於日軍。日軍先命老人嘗食。試其有毒與否。老人泰然先盡一碗。謂日軍日。汝曹何怯也。誰則毒人者。日軍大笑。乃各安心進食。但不逾一小時。毒遽發。大聲呼痛。相繼倒斃。老人亦劇痛不自持。同弊　肆中。蓋老人製麵時。曾下砒甚多。冀毒斃日軍。所以甘心先嘗者早己有决死之心。不如是不足使狡獪之日軍同歸於盡也。朱君傲雲服務於皇姑屯。刦後避兵。由平而滬。述其事於余。聖人云。勇者不懼。若老人者。殆大勇之流。足與法蘭西梅村小女子設計誆敵。　映古今矣。</p>
<h3>十九軍中一傷兵</h3>
<p>— 徵</p>
<p>日軍撤退矣。前晨余獨往家鄉南翔一路受難同胞甚衆。扶老携幼。面帶苦笑。相繼歸久别之家。沿途戰壕。仍綿綿相對。正午。方入鎭。一種凄凉之景。感人流涙。抵家。守門阿表述一日兵慘無人道事。爰記之於下。</p>
<p>當忠勇之十九路軍神速退守第二道防缐。某祠内後方醫院。須在極短之時間内。遷至崑蘇。故怱怱扛運各傷兵。但時在夜間。有一兵臥稻草中未及運走。明晨醒時。日軍己到。一見傷兵。即以鐵絲反缚雙手。致肉破血流。復以長鐵絲圍繞頸際。吊於石牌樓下。二日兵站立左右推送。往來碰於牌樓石柱。我忠勇之傷兵。操粤語斥曰。爾等不受敎育。直蠻族耳。余己受傷。不應如此侮辱。其聲壯烈。無號哭乞憐之音雜其中。二日兵乃更怒。猛剌十餘刀。傷兵血湧如潮。仍不喊痛。反大呼中華民國萬歲。當是時。阿表躱小河對岸樹後遥望。苦無法援救。但見傷兵身下之枯黃草葉。己染紅色。二日兵且笑且語。用槍柄約打半小時。後聞呼聲漸弱。嗚咽十餘聲。忽大呼中華民國萬歲而氣絶。嗚呼。壯哉。此傷兵惜知者終鮮。故錄之以告國人。</p>
<h3>戀愛哲學</h3>
<p>— 洪炯烈</p>
<p>戀愛究竟是什麽東西呢？就是總合人類男女兩性間靈肉作用，發生互愛的一個抽象的名詞。</p>
<p>我們要解答這問題，便要研究人類的生存慾和人之所以爲人的基本問題；我們知道一個人的成分，是靈與肉共同組合的，人與人間則有男女兩性之别，由男女兩性的交合，方能構成人類兩字的綜稱，人類才得共同在世界上組織生存的社會，而其生存的最大要素，大部有二種，一種是物質上的需要，一種是精神上的需要；前者是屬於肉慾的，就是五官，四肢，性具，等形體上的需要；後者是屬於靈慾的，就是色，聲，香，味，樂，的精神上的安慰；更進一步說；前者是自然的實質的，易見的，後者是隠藏的空想的，暗示的，藝術的。</p>
<p>這二種要素於人生都有連帶的，不可分離的密切的關係；人類都要它們互相來調和他與她的生活，而所謂「性」童問題却是介於肉與靈之間。</p>
<p>據生理，心理，美學方面來講，男女在生理上各貝有不同的天賦的自然的肉體的美，藝術家研究人體的美，有高嶺、小阜，叢林，幽谷的風景、有晚霞，晨曦，白雪，花朶的景緻。在男的方面，則有剛强雄偉的壯美；在女的方面，則有柔和蜿蜒的曲線，更有婉囀清脆的音樂和陶醉迷魂的香味的幽美。所以男女在靈魂上各有怡然神往之勢，於是互相愛慕着，追求着，而至肉的接觸滿足靈的快感。</p>
<p>造物因爲要延長或繼續人類的存在，所以有雌雄兩性的作用來交合，這種的交合，不限於知識，學術的而是世界萬物一禽，魚，獸，蟲，以及草木，礦石…等，皆能幹的，這也就是人與萬物生存最有意義的根本問題，明瞭這個基本道理，戀愛問題，就可迎刄而解。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>兩眼望清天，這句話原是失意者凄慘無聊的口吻，想不到我們中華國民，現在竟整個的陷入於凄慘無聊的境地；掙開眼來，看不到青天，所謂「青天白日滿地紅」，簡直是暗無天日滿地血涙，或者是漆黑一團罷了！斷送了東三省，簽訂了辱國的協定，當前國難，旣無澈底的對策；而内部的分崩離析，更不絶如縷：軍閥政客們的傾軋，貪官汚吏無限制的搜括；廣東海陸軍的内閧；各省匪勢的蔓延，及鴉片的公賣，這些不是外來的侵略，乃自召滅亡的敗象。民命國脈，奄奄一息，然而誰能救民水火，撥雲霧而見青天呢？</p>
<h3>二樹榮萎誌</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>瓦浦大通橋之集賢菴。有古銀杏二株。大數十圍。爲千年舊物。某夏大風雨。古銀杏折枝一。幾合抱。長若干尺。顧仰觀之。祇去其穉枝。稍漏天光而己。相去五十里之南翔某姓廚下。有物隆起尺許。可以憇坐。或云。即古銀杏斜出之根。可見是樹之大矣。去歲。有某甲來菴游息。隨出烟捲。取佛龕前之供香餘燼燃吸之。燼香即棄於古銀杏罅孔内。蓋樹年久拆裂。可以容物也。不料風飄殘葉。積罅孔中甚多。且天旱甚燥。燼香之火。着葉即燒　。烈燄如靈蛇之舑舌。及於幹苔枝蘚間。雖經村氓灌熄。然己一片焦黑。無復舊時蓊鬱蒼翠矣。僉以其枯萎。不甚惋惜。詎意今春樹忽怒茁新枝。密葉翳日。倭卒來寇。村落田舍。悉籠孕烽火中。而古銀杏仍得保全無恙。似有神靈呵護者。斯亦奇矣。崑山避難人爲予言。</p>
<p>南通張季直氏生時。有濠南别墅以爲莵裘。别墅中饒樹卉竹石之勝。氏愛松。乃遷他處一白皮松。移栽於别墅中。松根四圍。留故土方丈。恐根鬚與故土脫離。或易枯瘁也。方丈松根之土。圍以布。纒以索。承以竹編之筐。以輕便之軒車運徙之。當曲折以赴别墅也。須經某某街坊。</p>
<h3>國際間大賴債（上）</h3>
<p>— 開煦</p>
<p>賴債人人會。巧妙各不同。住在上海的人。欠了房錢。房東要趕搬塲。欠了電燈費。公司要剪線。但是我聽見。亦有房錢欠了五六個月。房東居然不趕搬塲。電費欠了三四個月。公司亦不來剪缐。我們不究其内容。不知彼如何欠法。覺得英明其妙。但你如果肯虛心請敎。他亦必欣欣然。將其中曲折奥妙。一一傳佈出來。那你就恍然大澈大悟。增加了不少普通的社會學識。人與人有賴債的方法。國際間亦有賴債的方法。一個人賴了别人的債。終究須歸法律解决。結果追憤舊賬。名譽損失。信用掃地。社會不能立足。而國際間赖債。祗要賴得過去。祗要開得出口。法律無靈。條約等於具文。你有兵力你來打。我打得過你。就同你幹一下。我打不過你。再慢慢想法子還債。倘使我打勝了你。非但我不欠你徵。你反要加倍的來還我。因爲國際間的債務。並不一定是商務或經濟上的借欵。有許多是强制成立的債務。即如歡戰中夁約國打勝了中央同。將獸戰四年的一切費用。攏攏統統。一棙括子。歸德國債付。德國當時。屈居人下。没有他法。說一是一。說二是二。現在好了。漸漸爬了起來。在歐洲會議席上。亦能侃侃而談。辯起歐戰的責任。不應德國單獨擔負。以及德國國内。景况奇窘。無法　續償付戰債賠欵等等。這種賴債方法。尙屬有理可說。德國書如從前被人拆過杪。現在不肯繼續做屈死。所以要挺一挺腰。說幾句硬話。如今賴債的方法更奇了。法國人要向美國賴起債來了。法國歐戰時。向美國借印子錢。美國當法國窮人看待。利息等等。一切寛待。法國盡了這筆錢。居然打了勝仗。非但打勝了德國。并且成了世界最大的富翁。搜括了全世界的金錢。去存在法國國家銀行裏。使世界全價。一日一日的高上去。然而他對於美國的戰債。非但不想遷。並且想賴掉。非但想賴掉。並且反咬一口。虎美國欠法國的債。非但說美國欠法國的債。並且說美國欠美國比同意大利等國的債。竟想聨合起一班債戸。羣起與債主爲難。你想這種賴法。豈非國際間的大賴債麽。但法國的賴債。究竟如何赖法呢？</p>
<p>有委巷一處。乃阻塞不得前。於是拆民屋。俟車過後。再行還造。其重視大夫松有如此。大夫松旣本舒築密。乃筵諸客賦詩章以寵之。於是大夫松名重一時。凡四方來游者。必以一瞻大夫松爲榮。同事蔣錫渭君。近日南通來。謂大夫松於氏殁後。即日就萎黃。茲己枯死。并遺枝賸幹亦無復可尋矣。</p>
<p>聲明　二十四日「蔡孑子讀拉丁文」未段「這奸孩子」四字。相老的意思。可以省去。又燭影摇紅等二詞係謝玉岑君所作。瀛去署名。並此聲明</p>
<h3>戎馬雙樓記（六三）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第八回　無邊哀怨懺情中難期曠逹　極度聲歌行樂裏得覩威嚴</p>
<p>梁笑雲笑嘻嘻的問道。怎見得就會閙笑話呢。安玉田急得只伸手向額上拭汗道。我有多大本領。你還不知道嗎。搬點書本子來冩冩弄弄。或者尙能對付。敎我竟去招土匪编民團成立新的軍隊。那豈不是紙上談兵。連半點影子都没有。我若眞能號召得了這些人。還不至於被牛黑風害得我家敗人亡呢呢。梁笑雲在櫻唇邊嘖嘖的嘘了幾聲。鄙薄著道。看你竟急成那個樣兒。多没出息。我說。你這個大書呆子。請安靜一點。聽我譬解譬解。與你通通竅。好是不好。安玉田哭喪着臉答道。好。你請講罷。梁笑雲笑道。你不曉得。如今幹差事的人。誰不是懸空兒勝世。只要哄得老葉相信。騙它一個冩明在委任狀上的大名義下來。自然就可吹吹打打。號召得動許多人。那些土匪和民團。那個不犯官迷。那個不想玩兒票改改正式郓曞</p>
<p>隊。只要你放風出去。就不愁没有那種人找上門來兜攬買賣。你再拿出點眼力。使出點手段來。挑選其中幾個眞有點力量的人。照樣也給與他們一種能號召的名義。分别委派爲團長營長。並好好聨絡着他們的心。使他們都樂意替你捧塲。做成功後也與他們自身眞有好處。那就好比集木成林。集腋成裘。由他們一憎一層的往下分頭找人去了。再歸總起來凑成一個整數。便不見得怎樣難了。即使那時凑不上十分齊。仗着究有了一點小小的基礎。再設法向老葉面前多說點好聽的話。求他另撥發一些軍械。并允許招募若干新兵補充。終能夠弄假成眞。把新隊伍組織完全。你若不先將這些眩惑的話哄他一下。老實說新起爐竈。成立新軍。或求他撥現成的隊伍歸你帶。一來他的軍隊。都早成了他部下高級軍官的私產。誰都不能讓你揷進去。當然他也是撥不動。二來他這做大官的人最怕麻煩。曉得憑空成立隊伍。需要多數的金錢和器械。豈肯隨便就給你這許多发處。便就話不投機。休想他能答應你那大一個題目。這就應了你的說話。只好幹一分掛名間差。一輩子爬不到高枝上去呢。</p>

<h3>紗花紗市有散空抵補</h3>
<p>成交額仍然零落</p>
<p>棉紗市情、微顯堅挺、因盤旋多日、蜀帮略有採辦、某巨廠自己裝運各方銷售、滬埠現貨較跌、人心稍振、散空抵補而上漲、據云川帮在漢口購進粗紗有一萬多包、所以大量交易、恐難實現、且傳日紗暗中進行猛力、惟多數心理、預料節後各方或有發展之望、買氣較昻、然塲中期紗成交、依然不多云、</p>

<h3>棉市軟挫</h3>
<p>棉市轉疲、美棉趨落、金價平平、市上現棉消費仍滯、但一般業外者以其底盤太小、且時期尙遠、本埠本棉存貨枯弱、所以做多心思未絶、據一部份云、漢口一埠存棉有十萬包之巨、據記者觀測、目前仍處於徘徊之境、須待美棉田畝報告之後、當有大變端發現耳、</p>

<p>江陰四鄉、今歲農民育蠶者不及去歲十之五、收蟻後陰雨連綿、驟寒驟熱、蠶蟻發育邏滯、早蠶祗大眠盱葉、晚蠶祗二眠、日前天降大雷雨、繼以冰雹、蠶均發生發化、口吐穢水、蠶身發黑、破腹爛斃、其臭蔓延甚速、而桑株亦受損害、葉價每擔八角至一元云、</p>
<h3>洋莊絲市奄無生氣</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無生氣、查紐約里昻雖均有廠經電報轉滬、而來價均仍低廉、廠方成本及押欵關係、每包虧蝕仍須二百餘兩、成交無聞、轉瞬新絲上市、若歐美絲價仍不見漲、則絲市前途、益抱悲觀云、</p>
<h3>河口紅茶己開盤</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、贛省河口莊之紅茶、己由錦降洋行開出盤價五十五兩、較去年見低二十五兩、祁門浮梁等路紅茶、因市盤較前鬆動、銀價繼續回跌、是以怡和天裕各行、進意均趨濃厚、全市成交共逹二千三百餘兩、售價自九十兩至一百六十五兩、較前見低二十箱、至綠茶市面、針秀眉銷路尙暢、珍眉一項、轉趨呆靜、屯溪來路莊及抽芯貨、均未見有繼續開出云、</p>
<h3>糧食米市到稀銷暢</h3>

<p>北市　天氣轉晴、各帮來源念六七號、店方態度因午節將近、不肯多添、各貨行情逐步昻升、青角楓練薄稻到頭有限、價硬角許、常錫北粳亦漲二角、洋蘆尖到銷二平、市亦帶起、河下廠家斛脚約三千石之譜、</p>
<h3>小絞米銷旺價漲二角</h3>
<p>其他各米跟漲角許</p>
<p>内地本街去胃極旺</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、本街與内地兩帮去胃極旺、崇明江北及鄉莊散囤均有問津、小絞米存底最多去化亦見轉旺、價乃跳漲至二角有奇、中次涉絞及其他各米一律跟漲角許、實因邇日杜米步漲、洋米有内地本街之暢辦、囤買問津、人心向上、統市小絞售開有二萬餘包、高貨價十一元、普通十元○九角半至十元○六角半、陳小絞三百包、價十元○四角二分、紅小絞三千包、價十元、小絞陳糙五百包、價九元五角半、馬來島米一千五百包、價十元○八角、一號西貢五百包、價十一元七角半至十一元六角、敏黨米三天交貨一千包、價十一元三角、又二三禮拜交貨二百噸、西貢七月份一千噸、價與上次相同云、</p>

<h3>五金青鉛靜極思動</h3>
<p>青鉛市面、自茶帮停辦後、趨勢久呈岑寂、標準因　境不良、故有江河日下之槪、查最廉價花族鉛售十三兩五錢、湖南鉛十三兩、三角鉛十二兩七錢半、近數日來兵工廠及客帮生意又呈逢勃氣象、故市上成交較爲熱閙、雖開價不見上進但一種堅硬之勢、殊非昔日可比、查昨日開出共有三百餘擔之、其購進者則爲福建帮及南京兵工廠云、</p>
<h3>南北貨白蓮貨底單薄</h3>
<p>地價行盤均升</p>
<p>白蓮近以貨底單薄、地價節節轉升、昨據函息、辦價己到六十二元、貨亦不多、有續升之勢、查此間行存亦稀、兼之廣東汕頭　帮、均有需要、是以售盤異常堅挺、昨市上莊售四十八兩、次之四十七兩、後市或將到五十兩、亦未可知、蓋供不應求、亦勢所必至也、</p>

<h3>最近之彈劾案</h3>
<p>— 榖梁</p>
<p>此次監察院長于右任、彈劾行政院長汪精衛，一案，昨閱本報南京電訊，說是；「監察院長于右任·以彈劾汪兆銘案，經中監會决議，應毋庸議，態度消極，二十四日呈中執會辭職。汪亦深自不安，同提辭呈，中常會二十四下午·特開談話會，僉以監院責司糾彈，此次不避嫌怨，行使職權，深足表現五院獨立精神。行政院簽訂停戰協·先曾呈經中政會通過，亦無不合。一致决議，對於于汪兩院長，均懇切慰留。」</p>
<p>一個因彈劾無效而求去，一個因自覺不安而辭職！而中常會却以「深足表現五院獨立精神」，及「亦無不合」，來分别慰留，誰是合法，誰不合法，不贊一詞，</p>
<p>但我們從「不避嫌怨，行使職權深足表現……！」看來，當然劾得不錯，被劾者，應付懲戒！若從「經中政會通過，亦無不合，」上立論，則似乎監察院彈劾得不正當，近於誣劾，</p>
<p>無論如何，我以爲兩方終有一錯，事關國家立法，不能糊塗了之，究竟是「違法」呢？還是「誣劾」？是非應求明白，若埋虎了結，未免太無公道，太無是非·</p>

<h3>洋燭製造法（二）</h3>
<p>— 允釐</p>
<p>（三）製造的手續</p>
<p>先用塊軟布，潤一點火油，將造燭機筒内外，塗抹一次。次用乾凈布揩乾，以去灰塵。然後將燭芯穿入模孔内，安於機上，再將配好的原料，放入鍋中溶化。至油質完全溶化後，即抽去鍋下的火，靜待片刻，等温度减低時，便注入模中，再在模外流以冷水，使燭完全凝固，然後拿出來，用刀將燭的尾端切齊，就成爲普通的洋燭了。</p>
<p>（四）洋燭着色法</p>
<p>先用一點斯的阿林，放入鍋中加熱，等到溶化後，便用所需要的顔料，研成細末，放入斯的阿林内混合融化之。再將這混合的顔料，加入巴辣芬和斯的阿林配合的溶液中，用力攪拌，使顔色均匀，然後照前面製造普通洋燭的手續灌入機筒内，就成功了。</p>
<p>（五）洋燭裝包法</p>
<p>洋燭製成功後·必須用紙包裏，有每包六支或十二支的，這是隨各製造廠的便利而規定。至包封的紙料，外面多是用藍色堅硬的厚紙，内層夾一張白色的薄蠟紙。</p>
<p>（六）模型的購置</p>
<p>製洋燭的模型，以白鐵製的爲最好，因爲白鐵不生褐色的鐵銹。銅製的不可用，因爲銅容易生綠色的銹物，不能製潔白的洋燭。機器的價值，是按製燭的大小而定。大的約數十元，小的只要六七元至十數元，美孚公司出售的最好。</p>

<h3>弄堂敎育</h3>
<p>— 無爲</p>
<p>丨雜感之二丨</p>
<p>在寸金之地的上海，一所屋子裏的天井，只有方桌即麽大，恰相稱於這個「井」的名稱，而一屋裏前樓，後樓，廂房，亭子間，的也住了不下五六家人家，於是要舒一口氣，只得到弄堂裏來，尤其是愛頑的小孩，弄堂便成了他們的公共娱樂塲，</p>
<p>在每一弄中，你可以遇到五種以上的吃飯担，十種以上的人物，各在他們的社會裏作他們不同的工作，</p>
<p>我有福生在這個都會裏，更有福住在這個都會裏最複雜的一角丨閘北，在我的四週，是給工廠與工人的噪聲所包圍着，當我冩作的時候，我常探首窗外，去換換空氣，因此弄堂中的活動情形，常常映入我的眼簾，而引起一種無謂的感慨，</p>
<p>在這個小小世界中活動的人們，大都是江北兒童，「大華晚報丨阿要大華晚報丨一個小孩子拿着一張紙，在那裏走來走去，模仿着賣報者的口吻喊，</p>
<p>來！那個怕你！有幾個小孩手中拿着竹竿，在那裏比武，胆小些的則在後方助威，或是駡，更有幾個在牆根下練把式，兩手支在地上，脚朝向天，把身子倒裁起來，有一個較小的，也來党試一下，不料手一滑，頭磕在水門汀上，嗚的一聲哭了，「没用的傢伙！哭不算好本領」！旁的防子鄙夷地說，接着又有一個倒竪起來了，另外一組則在那裏滾洞元，</p>
<p>「噹」「着了現在己欠我五個了」勝利者說，又有一組現做象徵的铸戲劇，一個孩子騎在另一個孩子的身上，拍着走，算是騎馬，在弄堂口則有賣糖的小販，用抽彩的籖筒的聲音來博取孩子們的金錢，在孩子們則除換得了糖菓之外，更學會了賭博的技能，小小的心靈中，會很聰明的應用到别種事情上去，猜手内握有多少銅元！或是豆，也可以賭一下輪嬴，他們在這小小的社會中，儘量學得了環境所給予他們的敎訓，更學會了足以侮辱對方，使對方聽了憤怒的言詞丨這便是他們的敎育，他們自早到晚生活在這個環境裏，只是期待着，期待着時光，老人來送他們到工廠裏去，</p>
<p>唉！可憐的工廠候補者，當我每看到時，就這樣想，</p>
<p>性的問題</p>
<p>變靜</p>
<p>她是我校的一個小學敎員，學生們在暗中呌她阿王，本來她是極靜默，不愛說笑，更不愛擦粉煬頭髮，尤其她是極厭惡觀電影，</p>
<p>數日以前，由她的好友凌女士介紹給她一位男友密斯脫Ｂ，他是凌女士兄弟的同學，在某大學讀書，自他倆認識後，她的態度便因之大變了，臉上塗得像無錫買來的大阿福一般，並且常張着二片血紅的嘴唇，和同事們有說有笑，她以前靜默的態度，己無形的淘汰了，頭髮是綣綣的，好似戒嚴時代的鐵絲網一班，眞的她是變了，完全變了，</p>
<p>有天天，蕙告訴我，她曾看見阿王同着Ｂ在北京影戲院看電影，首先我不信，後來我常聽見同學們說，某日遇見她同Ｂ在卡爾登看電影，某日又見她在甘戲院同着Ｂ在看電影，</p>
<p>有一個星期日的下午，蕙同玲到我家來，約我到法國公園去玩，那時我坐在家裏，眞覺得納悶，又是長久不到公園裏去玩了，所以便立刻同着她們去，那知事情凑巧極了，我們三人正坐在大樹下一張凳上談話時，恰巧他同Ｂ並肩來了，他不認識我們，所以仍仰着頭挺着胸，得意洋洋地踏着大步走着，但是她己看見我們，她覺得有些不好意思，低着頭，紅着臉，只當不看見我們，繞着别路去了，這次我總算得玩的不冤枉，看見了一幕活動的戀愛戲，</p>
<p>眞是這樣的出人意料，在一天放夜學後，我們都在宿舍裏看書時，蕙一步一跳的奔進宿舍來，輕輕的說；「喂！你們可知道，阿王失戀了，他的男友變心了，聽說他己另有一個非常美麗的女友，</p>
<p>你那會知道呢？我想不見得吧」，我驚奇的對着蕙說，</p>
<p>誰騙你們，人人都知道的呢，並且己有人見過Ｂ同着那個女子在某大戲院觀電影，他們的態度十分親密呢」，蕙賣弄般的說，</p>
<p>「那麽阿王知道嗎」？我不禁問她說，</p>
<p>「那當然知道，所以她二天不到校了」，蕙說，</p>
<p>「哦怪不得、他有二天不見了」珊淡：的說着，</p>
<p>「唉：我眞不知道，他們那樣親蜜，現在竟會到這般地步」·珠說，</p>
<p>「這種人倒虧他受過高深的敎育的」我在沉默中的歎憤憤的說，</p>
<p>「喔！男子的心眞不可測」珊摇着頭說，</p>
<p>晚餐鐘在擾雜的聲浪中，嘡嘡的響了，打斷了我們的談話，</p>

<h3>密司忒和密司</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>密司忒Ｍr是先生的代名詞，密司Ｍiss是小姐的Pronoun，這兩個名詞，雖是從英文字典中借來的，但在中國人的口裏，己說得很自然了，不信，你看摩登少年和時裝少女會面的時候，開頭第一句總是密司忒Ｘ和密司Ｘ，</p>
<p>Ｃ校的校長是美國的留學生，因爲他曾出過洋，所以帶了不少洋氣回來，他平日對於敎職員和學生，一槪稱之謂密司忒或密司，是多麽的客氣是多麽的平等，</p>
<p>校長對於學生有這樣的客氣，其他的敎職員，他們當然也不敢擺出架子而表現他們的尊嚴，所以在每次點名的時候，男生的名字，加上一個密司忒，而在女生的名字上，加上一個密司，</p>
<p>有一天來了一個代課先生，他也知道Ｃ校的校風，但他拿到了一本點名簿，在男女雜坐的敎室裏，竟不能知道那個是密司忒，那個是密司，躊躇了一會，終於被他想出了一種法子，</p>
<p>他的法子是從點名簿上看上去是男名字，便加上一個密司忒，女名字加上一個密司，因爲中國人的名字，大都一望而可判别男女的，但雖是一部分被他猜中了，有的女生，也許會題男名字，而有的男生，也許會題女名字的，笑話便因此而發生了，</p>
<p>男生加上了密司，女生加上了密司忒，發現了一次的錯誤，課堂裏便發出了一片的笑聲，待他點名完畢的時候，全課堂的學生，個個笑得要氣都要來不及透了，</p>
<h3>一位女同學的皮書包</h3>
<p>— 厂木</p>
<p>時間將近正午十二點鐘了，各個人的肚子裏都是在咕咕地作響，希望着快快散課，可是下課鐘還没有打，敎師站在講台上，儘是指手劃地講個不停，</p>
<p>嘡丨鐘聲才響了一下，没有等待師敎說「散課」大家都拿了書本，站起身來向外跑了，</p>
<p>很狹小的課堂門，塞住了許多人，前湧後擠地傾軋着·都是想捷足先歸，心裏像犯罪的人，從牢監裏出來的樣子一般，</p>
<p>碰！</p>
<p>一件東西落到地上的聲音，大衆的視綫都集中了那聲音的發源地，頓時一陣引人迷醉的香味，觸動了各個人的嗅覺，</p>
<p>一位女同學俯着身子，把掉落在地上的東西，拾進她的那隻小巧玲瓏底皮書包，除了幾册課本講義外，被旁人發現了那位女同學的皮書包裏，還有一瓶「三花牌雪花膏」一盒「宼丹」一管「Ｋissp」</p>
<p>roof」可惜一瓶Ｃappl牌香水、己經打碎在地上了，</p>
<p>這是一個疑問，那位女同學帶了那些東西·到學校來幹什麽？難道學校裏有「美容實習」的學課嗎？</p>

<h3>連環性的敎育雲光</h3>
<p>星期六的六午，孫先生照例要陪他的夫人出去看電影，但是因爲昨天在冩字間裏，同事老王講起輪盤賭怎樣怎樣的好玩，把孫先生聽得津津有味，就打動了他的心思，因和老王約了今天一仝到輪盤賭塲去玩玩，所以看電影這門功課，只好向他夫人告假了，並且恐怕他夫人在家裏寂寞，就摸出二十元鈔票，交給他的夫人，呌他約間壁的幾個小姊妹來打麻雀解悶，孫夫人接了鈔票，也就不再要求孫先生陪她出去看電影了。　　孫先生走出自己門口，暗暗自喜道，「這種女人眞討厭，動不動要跟着一同出去，今天可就清爽了。」</p>
<p>一點鐘後孫先生在輪盤賭塲裏下注，孫夫人在家裏約了小姊妹打牌。</p>
<p>孫夫人的兒子寳官纔只九歲，放學回來，一見他媽，就牽了她的衣裳角撕纒着，要她媽陪他出去買石筆皮球，孫夫人給寳官閙得不能工作了，就在身邊摸出一把銅子給寳官，呌他到衖堂口糖担上去押糖吃。</p>
<p>寳官拿到了錢，也就不閙了，很快活的去押糖了，孫夫人打牌時，没有寳官在旁撕纒，也就覺得清爽了。</p>
<p>從此以後，孫先生一下了冩字間就到輪盤賭塲裏去下注，孫夫人在家裏一到下午就約小姊妹打牌解悶，寳官放學還來，就到衖堂口去押糖，養成了一家門歡喜賭博的習慣。</p>
<p>有人說，寳官的歡喜押糖。是給孫夫人養成的。孫夫人的喜歡打牌。是給孫先生養成的，孫先生的喜歡輪盤賭，是給老王養成的，老王的喜歡輪盤賭，不知又給誰養成他的呢。</p>

<h3>縫窮婦繩武</h3>
<p>不論那一條弄堂，或那一條馬路，上午或下午，不時有手提元寳籃的縫窮婦，來來往往，行人方便，她們旣不高聲喚喊，也不奇貨可居，看生活之怎樣，索縫資之多少，當機立斷，毫不延遲，我們没帶家眷的他鄉客，衣服穿了，喚她補，襪子破了，喚她綴，一年到頭，無形中得到了很多的便利，無窮的實益，我們應該重重地感謝她們，</p>
<p>爲怎麽要喚做她們縫窮呢？是否她們窮了替人縫紉而喚縫窮，還是專替窮人縫紉而喚縫窮，在下問過了好多人，没有過半個確切的答復，現在還是個疑問，</p>
<p>她們的元寳籃中，不是個個放着雙矮小的凳子麽，從前聽見過有個人說，「她們的那隻凳子，假使是四隻脚向天放着的，那末她們除了天經地義的本夫以外，另外還有一個事業彷彿的愛人，（皮鞋匠）」但是我仔細的留心着，從没見過是凳面向天的，難道個個縫窮婦都是品行不端的麽，我想說這句話的人，或者有意破壞她們的名譽吧，</p>
<p>她們的品行怎樣，且不要管她，總之，她們對於我們這班流浪人，是有利的·所以我們應該感謝她們，敬重她們，</p>

<h3>野花的追求</h3>
<p>洪水</p>
<p>這實在是我在兆豐公園親自聽見了爲中國前途的獨幕劇、</p>
<p>一者玉十如何　才進園門·太陽就分外的晴朗，天空就分外的藍翠！」一個西裝楚楚的頎長青年担着一個肥短體裁也是革履西服的青年一面走一面說。「道却不見得；倒是呼吸着清潔新鮮的空氣，却好像和妙齡女親吻一般的爽氣。」</p>
<p>「對了！僅此就足償我們「曠課」的代價了！何况……」他便揚起揑着做配相的一種名呌「司提克」的東西遥向柳蔭深處蠕蠕在動的地方，畫了半個弧形接着又說：「這些美不勝收的艶福，正和開展覽會般的預備着我們去隨意鑒賞哩！」</p>
<p>「誰希罕！無論如何，總及不上我們寢室對面樓上「羣英齋」的那些「一律摩登」的女同學；可惜現在學校搬塲，令人不勝有「雕闌玉砌應猶在，只是朱顔改」之慨。」</p>
<p>「提到校中的近水樓台，那麽我同班的白氏姊妹又如何？但總嫌其「不如野花香」呀！」</p>
<p>「白氏姊妹的鼎鼎大名、在你嘴巴裏我不知聽了幾千回，實際上恐怕香屁都難聞着的吧！」</p>
<p>「老王！你不要把女生估量得太高」</p>
<p>，她們也愛和我們取閙哩！譬如今天理化堂上，因爲第二排同學嘈雜之聲較大些，她們就作「ＳＳ……」的叱聲，幸得有個同學呌出一聲「快拿馬桶來，當心春水漏在講堂裏」的打趣話，才把她們漲紅着臉色地壓服下去。」</p>
<p>「哈……虧他一時想得出這樣出奇制勝的打趣話，眞天才！」</p>
<p>「喊！前天她們還和我個人發生一種關係，我看紅樓夢正看得出神的時候，忽有一種鶯嗔燕怒似的「好狗不攔路」的叱駡聲，輕輕地送到我的耳鼓裏，回頭一看，原來是白氏姊妹亭亭玉立着……」說到這兒他果然補演一個「回頭看」的姿式，便發現後面有個穿膠底鞋的人（不是白氏姊妹實是鄙人）在緊跟着他們偷聽着，於是他吃了一驚似的「顧而言他」，當然我也只好識相些赸往青草地上，這幕未盡劇嗣後還要表演出些什麽花樣景，那也無從而探悉了！</p>

<h3>A Second Discussion on the Current Importance of Preventing Floods</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in a previous commentary, we already appealed to the government to severely punish those responsible for last year's great disaster and to urgently take measures to prevent the recurrence of floods. Today, let us reiterate this point.</p>
<p>In ancient times, it was said, "Those skilled in managing water do not compete with water for land." If a river is blocked, it will inevitably burst. The key is to dredge it to make it flow freely. Therefore, Yu the Great dredged the nine rivers and guided the hundreds of rivers, allowing water to flow through the land, rather than merely blocking it. Today, the Yellow River's riverbed is higher than the ground, and the Yangtze River's riverbed is also heavily silted. Tributaries cannot flow smoothly, and lakes cannot store water. For example, near Dongting Lake, silted land has even been reclaimed for county government. Also, at Fankou in eastern Hubei, warlords, for their own private gain, built dikes and expanded farmland, effectively locking the flow of the Yangtze River at this point. Therefore, when we talk about water management today, dredging should be the priority, and defense should be secondary. Now, even this secondary strategy is not being implemented promptly, which is truly the most lamentable and hateful phenomenon.</p>
<p>Historically, dike construction has always taken place during the dry season in winter, because once the spring floods arrive, it becomes impossible to start work. Now, it is already summer, and earlier this month, the Hankou area experienced days of continuous rain, and the river level is rising daily. If we do not act quickly to defend against the floods and instead delay and watch passively, then as the water level rises, rescue efforts will become more difficult. We will inevitably suffer another major disaster, and we will only be able to look up to the heavens and ask, "What can be done?"</p>
<p>After last year's disaster, the government talked about disciplining water conservancy officials, but as time passed, the matter was shelved. The past is gone. What is important is the present, and we must not delay any further. Those who have special responsibilities for water conservancy are entrusted with the lives of the survivors of the disaster. They must not neglect their duties and cause another catastrophe. In his report to the Central Government this month on the Grand Canal project, Mr. Ye Chucang said, "It is always easier to prevent things before they happen than to remedy them afterward. In recent years, the people have suffered great losses. We can only blame ourselves." But what good is blame? Punishing those responsible for last year's failures and averting the current crisis would truly benefit our people.</p>
<p>Currently, in addition to the water disaster relief association using work relief to build dikes in sections, farmers in various places are already voluntarily starting to build dikes. For example, in southern and northern Anhui, farmers are voluntarily raising the height of dikes, and construction has also begun along the river in Jiangxi Province. However, we believe that the waterways of the entire country are interconnected and should be planned comprehensively, rather than building dikes in sections, each working for their own benefit, and harming their neighbors. Therefore, the government should urgently gather experts to conduct precise surveys to determine which areas should be dredged and which areas should be protected by dikes. The government should then prioritize these projects based on their urgency and start construction accordingly. With the government leading the way, the people will undoubtedly enthusiastically support and assist. If we pool the strength of the entire country to prevent floods, water will surely be controllable.</p>
<p>In short, last year's major disaster is not far in the past, and the lessons we learned should not have faded from our memories. The mistakes of the past are now valuable experiences. If we work hard based on these experiences, we should not repeat the mistakes of the past and recast an irreparable disaster.</p>
<p>As for the current Water Disaster Committee, it should intensify its work at this time. It is already summer, and we should prevent the spread of disease in the disaster areas, and design plans to mitigate future floods. Disaster relief should not only occur after a disaster. If we can make even a small effort to prevent a disaster, its effectiveness will be ten times greater than providing relief after the disaster.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Reception of Wusong and Baoshan</h3>
<p>Forts, barracks, and gunpowder depots received simultaneously.</p>
<p>Japanese troops temporarily stationed in the area will withdraw entirely by June 2nd.</p>
<p>The joint troop withdrawal monitoring committee organized by various countries and the troop withdrawal area takeover committee organized by the National Government have been proceeding swiftly and smoothly since they began taking over the areas occupied by the Japanese army. Yesterday was the final day of the takeover, and a total of five locations, including Wusong Town, Baoshan County, and the Wusong Fortress forts, barracks, and Sanguantang gunpowder depot, had been completely taken over. The remaining four locations in the Wusong Jiangwan Yinxiang and Zhabei areas adjacent to the concessions are temporary stationing areas for the Japanese army during their withdrawal, according to Annex 1 of the ceasefire agreement. However, according to the Japanese side, they will also be completely withdrawn by June 2nd, and it is expected that they will be completely taken over by the deadline. The occupation of Shanghai, Jiading, Songjiang, and Baoshan, which lasted for several months, can now be declared over. The details of the final day of the takeover yesterday are summarized below.</p>
<p>Details of Group Takeover</p>
<h3>Personnel Handing Over</h3>
<p>The personnel handing over on both sides were: (1) Wusong Town: Section Chief Li from the Seventh District (Chinese), Major Tokizawa (Japanese); (2) Wusong Fort Taiwan Barracks: Commander Chen Yuwen of the Southern Fort, Reporting Station Commander Zhao Jinbai (Chinese), Major Yoshitome (Japanese); (3) Baoshan County: County Magistrate Sun Xiwen (Chinese), Major Renka (Japanese); Sanguantang Gunpowder Depot: Section Chief Gao Xitian of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau (Chinese), Major Renka (Japanese).</p>
<h3>Joint Committee Monitoring</h3>
<p>When taking over the Wusong Fortress forts, barracks, and Baoshan County Sanguantang gunpowder depot yesterday, the joint committee sent British Counselor Burtoni, American Counselor Sorel, Japanese Military Attaché Harada, and Director Wen Yingxing, etc., to depart from the U.S. Consulate on Jiujiang Road at 9:00 a.m. At 10:30 a.m., they arrived at Sanguantang in Baoshan to monitor the troop withdrawal and takeover. At 11:30 a.m., they went to Wusong to monitor the takeover. After the formal handover documents were signed, they returned to the committee to report.</p>
<h3>Takeover of Wusong Fortress</h3>
<p>One-third of the Wusong area, where the Japanese army was stationed, was returned yesterday as agreed. Our side dispatched personnel to negotiate the handover time, and both sides originally agreed to hold it at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. However, due to procedural reasons, the Japanese army there did not withdraw until 2:00 p.m. The handover locations were divided into two areas: one was the Wusong garrison area, and the other was the Songkou Fortress area. The details are recorded separately below.</p>

<h3>Signing at Huafeng Cotton Mill</h3>
<p>Takeover Commissioners Tang Chengzong, Li Shengjun, Yin Tixin, and Cha Nanqiang, and Section Chief Li of the Seventh District, arrived at the Huafeng Cotton Mill at 10:20 a.m. At 10:55 a.m., the commander of the Japanese Seventh Regiment, Tokizawa, accompanied by Adjutant Kurihara Kaiji and interpreter Tsuneichi, arrived and met on the second floor of the factory's office building. The formal takeover signing was originally scheduled for 11:00 a.m., but due to the late arrival of the joint committee taking over Baoshan, the wait continued until 11:50 a.m. Abe from the Japanese side of the joint committee's subgroup arrived first, followed by British, American, and Italian military officers, as well as Chinese representative Wen Yingxing and Japanese representative Harada, and the signing ceremony was held. It was exactly noon. After the signing, the joint committee members left first. The commander of the Japanese army, Tokizawa, then invited the takeover commissioners and reporters to lunch. At 1:20 p.m., they took photos and dispersed. Section Chief Li returned to the district office, and Tang Chengzong also left to handle municipal affairs in Wusong. At 2:00 p.m., Li Shengjun, Yin Tixin, and Cha Nanqiang, together with the police, went to the Taiwan fort to take over the fort.</p>
<h3>Wusong Town Handover Document</h3>

<h3>Banquet of the Japanese Commander</h3>
<p>After both sides completed the signing, the Japanese garrison commander, because all Japanese troops had to withdraw before 2:00 p.m., immediately held a banquet to entertain the takeover personnel. When the first course, "Lobster," was served, the Japanese garrison commander raised his glass to the guests to celebrate the success of the takeover, and gave a speech, saying, "Today, I am very happy to return the security affairs of Wusong Town to China. In Japan, lobster is considered the most auspicious food, so today I am offering it to the guests to wish happiness to the future of China and Japan." Then, the Japanese adjutant Kurihara Kaiun, who was also present, raised his glass and stood up, saying, "Today, I am very happy to formally withdraw troops. From now on, I hope that China and Japan will cooperate to eliminate the communist disturbances in the world." The banquet ended at 1:10 p.m., and our takeover personnel then retired together to inspect the fortress area.</p>
<h3>Situation of the Takeover Fortress</h3>
<p>The takeover personnel of the fortress arrived at the Yunzaobang Bridge at 10:25 a.m. and proceeded toward the Aquatic School of Taiwan Fort. When they were heading east to the Shihua Road intersection, which was close to the fort, four Japanese soldiers suddenly stopped them from advancing. Our takeover commissioner Tao Xiaojie got out of the car to explain the purpose of their visit. The Japanese squad leader Xiaoyan then got into Tao's car and accompanied them towards the Aquatic School, while our reporters were all blocked at the Shihua Road intersection. The Japanese side firmly refused to let them through. The reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency was able to go with Tao et al. because he was in the same car. When the car arrived in front of the Aquatic School, Xiaoyan first got out of the car to explain the purpose of the visit to the Japanese Major Yoshitome Yoshiyuki there. Then, Special Commissioner Tao Xiaojie and Special Commissioner Liang Fuchu got out of the car to meet with Yoshitome.</p>
<h3>Sudden Misunderstanding by the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, a misunderstanding arose after only a few words. Major Yoshitome loudly said that Zhao Jinbai and Chen Wenzheng, who were taking over the fortress, were not the originally designated people, and firmly refused to hand it over. Although Tao and Liang tried to explain in various ways, it was of no use. They had no choice but to return to the Huasha Factory and negotiate with Tokizawa Masayoshi, commander of the Japanese Seventh Regiment. Then, Chen and Zhao officially met with Yoshitome.</p>
<h3>Repeated Inquiries to the Police</h3>
<p>During the meeting, Yoshitome repeatedly asked whether the 150 policemen dispatched by our side were plainclothes police, in a stern tone. Chen and Zhao repeatedly said yes, and Yoshitome's expression eased. He then took 20 guards and an interpreter and rode with our four members Tao, Liang, Chen, and Zhao to the southern fortress of Taiwan Fort. They abandoned the car and walked in single file from the earth embankment of the fort to the north. The time was 11:40 a.m. Everyone stopped at the northernmost end of Taiwan Fort.</p>
<h3>Heavily Guarded Handover</h3>
<p>At the north end of Taiwan Fort, there was a small pavilion that had been destroyed by artillery fire, with a cement round pier in the middle, shaped like a round table. Yoshitome and Chen and Zhao entered the pavilion, while Japanese soldiers were densely deployed around it. Even the two special commissioners Tao and Liang could not enter and could only stand fifty yards away, looking on from afar. After forty minutes, Yoshitome and Chen and Zhao completed the signing in the pavilion. Yoshitome and Chen and Zhao then came out together and returned to the parking place, boarded the car, and proceeded to the barracks of Taiwan Fort to hand over the barracks there.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Returns the Barracks</h3>
<p>At 12:40 p.m., they arrived at the western barracks of Taiwan Fort. First, Yoshitome and the two receiving members Chen and Zhao entered the barracks for a week of inspection. A platoon of 60 soldiers stationed inside was already preparing to depart. At 1:00 p.m., they went to the Merchant Marine Academy to inspect the Japanese troops stationed there. The Japanese troops there had already departed for Hongkou at 9:00 a.m., so the school was empty. At 1:15 p.m., they entered the Aquatic School again for inspection, and the entire process was completed. After the inspection, Yoshitome ordered his subordinates to prepare to depart and instructed the two receiving commissioners Chen and Zhao to lead the police here at 2:00 p.m. to take over.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Immediately Withdraws</h3>
<p>When reporters accompanied the receiving members through Jungong Road, they saw heavy baggage, horses, and heavy artillery units that had withdrawn from Songzhen heading south. The Huafeng Cotton Mill was still a temporary stationing area for the Japanese army and had not yet been evacuated. The Taiwan Fort factory decided to hand over to our receiving members at 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon. Twenty-three military vehicles had been prepared in advance and parked in the fortress field. When our two squads of plainclothes police arrived on time, one squad of Major Yoshitome of the Japanese Fourth Regiment boarded the vehicles and withdrew from the fortress. The number of people was about 200.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Handover Document</h3>
<p>The handover documents for the fortress and barracks are as follows: (A) Fortress Handover Document: (1) Matters concerning the security of the Wusong Fortress; (2) Matters concerning the dormitories used by the Japanese army at the Wusong Fortress. Both items are received together. At 12:00 noon on May 25, Showa 7, the hander-over: Major Yoshitome, Commander of the Japanese Garrison; the receiver: Chen Yuwen, Commander of the Wusong Fortress. (B) Barracks Handover Document: (1) Matters concerning all items. Both parties receive together. May 25, Showa 7, the hander-over: Major Yoshitome, Commander of the Japanese Garrison; the receiver: Cao Jinbai, Commander of the Wusong Reporting Station.</p>
<h3>Plainclothes Police Take Over Wusong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the personnel responsible for taking over the security affairs of Wusong were one company and two squads of plainclothes police, totaling more than 150 people, led by Chief Instructor Lu Hongru himself. They deployed in the Wusong Town area after 2:00 p.m. In the town, there were five guard posts, four guard posts along the railway line, four liaison posts, and one post at the Seventh District Headquarters. In the fortress area, one squad of plainclothes police was stationed, and one squad was also stationed at the artillery team. Two squads were also stationed at the Merchant Marine Academy. The plainclothes police were under the command of Section Chief Li of the Seventh District. All of the original police officers in the area had been scattered after the outbreak of the war and would be gradually recalled in the coming days. The Seventh District Headquarters in the area had been restored yesterday. The Second Branch could not be restored immediately because the Japanese army was still in the stationing area. The First Branch was received yesterday, but only one-fifth of the original area. It can also be restored in the coming days. The chiefs of the various branches in the district, Yin Gongtian of the Seventh District Office, Ye Shouchun of the Seventh District First Branch, and Feng Ren of the Seventh District Second Branch, had all arrived in Song yesterday.</p>
<h3>Post-War Affairs in Songzhen</h3>
<p>Regarding the post-war affairs in Songzhen, according to Section Chief Li of the Seventh District and Tang Chengzong, Municipal Commissioner of Wusong, at the beginning of this takeover, it is necessary to make every effort to maintain public order and rectify internal affairs. The local self-defense corps originally had two teams with complete firearms and clothing, and they were very effective in maintaining local security. Now, due to the war, more than half of the clothing and firearms have been lost, so it is urgent to restore them. The health affairs in the area have been arranged for the health bureau to go to clean up today, and it should be clean and tidy in the coming days. In addition, the housing in various places has been destroyed by fire, and residents are gradually building houses, but many do not follow the regulations, so streets and roads are often occupied. Therefore, it is also urgent to find ways to crack down on this.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Wusong Fortress</h3>
<p>The location of the Wusong Fortress is very important. The north and south platforms have a total of four 12-inch cannons, three 8-inch cannons, four 6-inch cannons, five 4.7-inch cannons, and four 2.2-inch cannons. Nine cannons are distributed on the north platform, and all the large cannons are gathered here. The south platform has eleven cannons, totaling twenty cannons. The two platforms extend for a mile and a half. The Japanese army has dismantled two of the 4.7-inch cannons from the north platform and four of the 2.2-inch cannons from the south platform. The remaining cannons have broken muzzles, and some were destroyed by the Japanese army after the occupation. They are all difficult to repair. The cannon bases have been destroyed, and the ammunition rooms next to the cannons have been completely blown up. The six barracks behind the platforms have also been damaged, and those that remain are full of holes. There are many shell holes on both platforms, and some have accumulated water. The cannon barrels have graffiti from the Shanghai Japanese Boys' Brigade, and exploded and unexploded shells can be picked up everywhere. There are also many shells left in the cannon bores, which shows the haste of our army's retreat at the time. The wireless radio transmitters have been broken, and the stones of the cannon bases have been blown into pieces, piled up in various low-lying areas. This shows the credit of the war at the time and the fierceness of the enemy's artillery fire. It is said that many of our loyal soldiers are buried here, and the desolate scenery is lamentable. It is said that the loss of the fortress, with the four 12-inch cannons, each worth 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, and each cannon base costing more than 50,000 yuan, the total loss amounts to tens of millions. After the takeover, the first thing to do will be to clean up. At this time of national treasury depletion, for this national defense necessity, it is feared that it will be difficult to raise funds for restoration for a while. Alas!</p>

The ceremony was originally scheduled for 11:00 a.m., but it was delayed until 12:00 a.m. due to the late arrival of the joint committee members of various countries.

The county magistrate then sent Section Chief Gao Xitian to sign and receive on behalf of the county magistrate.</p>
<h3>Fourth Day of Postal Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>Leaders from All Sectors Mediated Yesterday</p>
<p>The General Labor Union and Others Urged Against Insistence</p>
<p>The Labor Union Will Formally Discuss This Morning</p>
<p>Resumption of Work is Hoped for if Agreement is Close</p>
<h3>Process of Mediating the Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>The Shanghai postal strike has lasted four days. Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Gongbo arrived in Shanghai by plane from Nanjing yesterday, initiating mediation efforts. This reporter learned last night that the postal strike issue is expected to be resolved within the next two days. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng sent letters yesterday inviting representatives from both the postal workers' and employees' unions to the municipal government for talks. Leaders from various sectors of the community have stepped forward to mediate, hoping for a swift resolution to the labor dispute. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, leaders from various sectors, including Shi Liangcai, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Gongquan, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, and Lin Kanghou, convened a mediation meeting at the Lian She on Avenue Haig, gathering postal workers' and employees' union representatives Zhang Kechang, Zhu Xuefan, Fu Dewei, and Shi Zhitang, among others, to discuss solutions. The discussions proceeded very well. It is said that the government is likely to accommodate the union's demands, and the union has also indicated that it will not escalate the strike before a final resolution is reached. The meeting adjourned at 8 PM, and the union representatives immediately reported the results of the discussions to the strike committees of both unions. After receiving the report, the committees immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss the matter in detail and decided that this morning at 10 AM, postal workers' representatives will meet with leaders from various sectors at the original location for formal discussions to find practical solutions. If a final agreement is reached, all postal workers will resume work.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Establishes Postal Delivery Service</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce adopted the suggestion of Standing Committee member Wang Yansong and established a temporary postal delivery service to benefit its members and businesses. The service is currently being handled by Zheng Chengqing, the chamber's secretary-general, along with the chamber's Boy Scouts and the China Delivery Company. Businesses and industries in the city can send their letters directly to the chamber for delivery, from 9 AM to 4 PM. The business community finds this very convenient.</p>
<h3>Airmail Services Continue</h3>
<p>Since China National Aviation Corporation requested various telegraph offices and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to accept airmail, people in Shanghai have found it very convenient. The company has now planned to have the company transfer mail from Shanghai to stations along the Yangtze River, Jinpu Railway, Longhai Railway, and Pinghan Railway, as well as provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, to local post offices in Nanjing, Anqing, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, Shashi, Wanxian, and Chongqing for delivery. In addition to affixing sufficient ordinary postage stamps as required, those sending mail to stations east of Hankou only need to add 15 cents for airmail postage, while those sending mail to areas west of Hankou need to add 30 cents for airmail postage. Detailed information has been published separately by the company in the advertisement column of this newspaper.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Reopened Branches</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has decided to prioritize the reopening of important branches, such as the 5th branch on Wusong Road, the 9th branch on Carter Road, the 13th branch on Rue Cardinal Foch, the 18th branch on Avenue Joffre, the 19th branch on Tilanqiao, the 23rd branch on Jing'an Temple Road, and the Sichuan Road Bridge Administration. The Administration appointed officials Gang Tian to oversee the Wusong Road branch, Qiu Weili to oversee the Avenue Joffre branch, Mike Lun to oversee the Jing'an Temple branch, and Desha Sai to oversee the Rue Cardinal Foch branch. They gathered at the Administration and each led three Chinese workers (not postal workers) at 1 PM to find ways to reopen. However, the Carter Road and Tilanqiao Administration branches have not yet been dispatched due to a lack of personnel.</p>
<h3>Japanese Open Temporary Post Office</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the Japanese have also set up a temporary postal service within the Japanese Elementary School on Route Tenant de la Tour, exclusively for collecting mail destined for Japan and its territories. Furthermore, foreign mail arrives by ship almost daily, but ship owners have no authority to deliver to anyone other than the post office, so the mail can only be temporarily stored.</p>
<h3>Attitude of the General Labor Union</h3>
<p>Yu Xianting, Wang Jianping, and others from the Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai General Labor Union issued an important statement regarding the postal unrest, addressed to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, the various ministries and commissions of the National Government's Executive Yuan in Nanjing, and compatriots in all provinces through newspapers nationwide: Since its establishment, this union has always aimed to pursue the interests of workers themselves and not participate in any political activities. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai postal unrest, the outside world has had misunderstandings and rumors have spread, as if this union's words and actions are being manipulated by postal workers. The members of this union hereby solemnly declare that such rumors are detrimental to the reputation of this union. Upon investigation, at the beginning of the postal unrest, this union was deeply concerned that once it erupted, it would have a profound and significant impact on society. Therefore, it repeatedly declared its hope that the traffic authorities and postal workers would calmly and rationally discuss the matter at length, hoping to turn danger into safety. Unfortunately, things did not go as planned, and the unfortunate incident occurred during this time of urgent national crisis. Although the members of this union knew that mediation would be difficult, they still worked hard and tirelessly to mediate. Therefore, on the 22nd of this month, they appointed representatives to meet with the mayor, strongly advocating to avoid the expansion of this unfortunate incident. This humble effort should be recognized by society. Recently, the attitude of the postal workers remains固执成见. The concession authorities have taken the opportunity to establish a foreign temporary postal service, and the consulates of various countries are also planning to set up their own post offices. This dangerous phenomenon will negatively impact social peace and stability and inevitably shake the foundation of the postal service. The original intention of consolidating the postal foundation may turn into destroying it. During this critical time, this union cannot help but regret the expansion of the postal unrest. Furthermore, the postal workers did not report before the strike and have avoided meeting afterward. The inside story is open to question. The members of this union believe that the erroneous actions of the postal workers' and employees' unions should be corrected. After deliberation by the members of the two committees, it was decided to earnestly persuade the two postal workers' unions to consider the overall situation and resume work as soon as possible to facilitate traffic and save the critical situation. This statement is hereby made for your review. Furthermore, the union held a regular meeting at 117 Fuyou Road at 10 AM yesterday. Yu Xianting, Chen Peide, Weng Ruifu, and others attended. Regarding the postal workers' and employees' strike case, it was resolved to hand it over to the executive and supervisory committee for handling and to convene a meeting of the executive and supervisory committee at 2 PM on the 29th. (Two) Regarding the proposal to send representatives to meet with Chen Gongbo, it was resolved to appoint Yu Xianting, Weng Ruifu, Chen Peide, and Zhou Xuexiang as representatives.</p>
<h3>City Boy Scouts Express Their Position</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Corps participated in the National Salvation work of the 19th Route Army last time, it has been highly respected by society. As a result, the organization has become more stringent, and training has become more intensive. Because the postal strike society is experiencing traffic disruption, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has organized a temporary postal delivery service to facilitate letters from member stores and entrusted the Corps to oversee everything. After hearing the news, the postal workers' union sent a letter inquiring, and the Corps replied with a letter explaining the nature of the service. The incoming and outgoing original letters are found below: (1) Letter from the Strike Committee: Dear Sirs, We have heard that the postal authorities plan to request your Boy Scout Corps to take on the task of delivering letters during the strike period. Upon investigation, our association's current movement is entirely out of a deep concern for protecting the postal service. The purpose is extremely pure, and the intention is very far-reaching. However, the Ministry is limited by preconceived notions and has not sincerely accepted the proposed plan, leading to the forced strike, which is truly heartbreaking. Now, various regions have begun to respond, and the day of resolution is not far off. We hope that your Boy Scout Corps will show deep sympathy with the patriotic and postal-loving enthusiasm, resolutely refuse to participate, and urge the Ministry to wake up and resolve the matter as soon as possible to facilitate traffic. We cannot express our anticipation enough. This letter is addressed to the City Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Corps, the Presidium of the Strike Committee of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Shanghai Postal Employees' Union. (2) Reply from the Boy Scout Corps: Dear Sirs, Upon receiving your letter, there are many misunderstandings. Upon investigation, our Corps recently received an order from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the host organization, to oversee the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's temporary postal delivery service and to perform duties, which has already been announced by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. As for the so-called request from the postal authorities to our corps to deliver letters mentioned in your letter, it is completely untrue. Moreover, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has already telegraphed the Ministry of Communications, fully adopting your union's well-intentioned suggestions, and our corps expresses full sympathy for your strike. We are happy to be of service within our capabilities. We hereby reply urgently, hoping for your review. This letter is addressed to the Strike Committee of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Shanghai Postal Employees' Union, Tian Minggao, Yu Guangxuan, and Ying Jing, Acting Commanders of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Corps.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Postal Head Office</h3>
<p>Our country's postal service has been arduously built and painstakingly managed for more than thirty years to achieve its current greatness, unlike other state-owned enterprises that have been overturned and ruined by corrupt officials. This is due to its transcendence of political tides, its adherence to the principle of postal economic self-sufficiency, the strictness of its established system, the completeness of its organization, and the diligence and hard work of postal workers. Otherwise, with natural disasters, internal wars, continuous years, poor politics, and obstructed traffic, our postal service would hardly be able to avoid being devastated and ruined. Since the recovery of postal rights, we have been deeply fortunate that the fighting spirit of the past thirty years has been developed and promoted. The future of the postal service will not be difficult to surpass the world and keep pace with Europe and the United States. However, in recent years, the traffic authorities have changed the direction of the postal service. The previously complete organization is now being divided horizontally. The previously good system is now being destroyed. The previously economically independent postal service, which was self-sufficient, is now being arbitrarily allocated and used for other non-urgent projects. The rights and protections that postal workers have had for a long time have been taken away, and the postal workers who have depended on the postal service for more than thirty years are now in a state of insecurity. Such things are countless. We have witnessed the only remaining achievement of more than thirty years, the postal service that has always been reputable, gradually falling into a state of fragmentation, decline, and ruin. It is truly heartbreaking and makes people want to cry. However, we do not want to be sad about this. We must think of ways to save the postal crisis of today. It is not too late to mend the fold even after the sheep have been lost. Therefore, we unite postal workers across the country and strive together to save the postal service from its chronic illness and lay the foundation for its lasting strength. Gentlemen from all walks of life, please appreciate our loyalty to the postal service and offer your sympathetic assistance. We sincerely ask for your review. National Postal Workers' Union, May 24th.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhaoming Cables All Provinces and Cities to Do Their Best to Maintain Postal Services</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan, urgently cabled all provincial and municipal governments and forwarded to county governments on the 25th, stating, "Upon investigation, the various demands of the Shanghai postal workers regarding the treatment of postal workers have been considered and accommodated by the Ministry. As for the merging of the Postal Savings Bureau and the suspension of airmail funding, which relate to national administration and transportation construction, they should be discussed in the long term and cannot be resolved by the Ministry. It is deeply feared that postal workers in various places do not understand this and will take actions outside the scope of their duties. The following measures should be taken immediately: (1) If there are signs of a strike by workers in various places, please first give them sincere persuasion. All employees who have served in the postal service for a certain number of years should be diligently persuaded to listen and work hard. The Executive Yuan will order the Ministry to promote them preferentially as a reward. (2) If a strike has already taken place, an order should be issued to resume work within 24 hours. Those who exceed the time limit will be dismissed. The local telegraph bureau, chamber of commerce, public security bureau, or equivalent agencies should jointly dispatch personnel to assist the local postmaster in organizing a temporary mail collection and delivery agency. Proper arrangements should be made for the dismissal of postal workers to avoid disruption. If there are illegal actions affecting public order, please deal with them strictly. (3) If the postmaster evades responsibility, please instruct the president of the chamber of commerce to preside over the bureau's affairs. (4) The original postage stamps of the post office should be ordered to be handed over. If they are insufficient, proper alternative methods should be devised to avoid abuse. This matter concerns public transportation, and the governments must provide enthusiastic assistance to ensure that the situation is resolved without incident. Please report at any time. This is of utmost importance." (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Congress Discusses Blount Proposal</h3>
<p>Advocates Establishment of Dictatorial Government in Honolulu</p>
<p>To Prevent Military Conspiracy by Japanese Americans</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 24th: The US Congress today began handling the Blount proposal, which seeks to establish a military dictatorship in Hawaii. Blount explained that the proposal is necessary for the proper management of Hawaii and is a crucial step to prevent Japanese Americans on the island from conspiring to destroy our military installations overnight in times of emergency. He also cited the recent Massie Case as evidence of the erosion of authority. Rear Admiral Byrd, Commander of the US Navy, stated that he personally had no reason to doubt the loyalty of any American citizens to the country. General MacArthur, Chief of Staff of the Army, also stated that the proposed change in the political system would have little impact on the defense of Hawaii, as the defense of the island must depend on whether there is sufficient naval and military power.</p>

<p>After Much Delay</p>
<h3>Japanese Elder Cabinet Formed</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Saitō Concurrently Serves as Foreign Minister for the Time Being</p>
<p>Inauguration Ceremony Scheduled for Today</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: The Saitō Cabinet was temporarily expected to be stranded due to Tatsuo Yamamoto's firm refusal to serve as Minister of the Interior. However, after persuasion from the leaders of the Minseitō (Constitutional Democratic Party) and Saitō, Yamamoto agreed to join the cabinet. Chief Prosecutor Matsukichi Oyama also accepted the invitation to join the cabinet as Minister of Justice in the afternoon. As Koki Hirota firmly declined to serve as Foreign Minister, Saitō will temporarily serve concurrently. The Foreign Minister post will be filled later by choosing one of two candidates: Ambassador Matsudaira and Keijirō Matsui. Count Kodama will serve as Governor-General of Taiwan. The decision was reported to Saionji at 8:20 PM. The final list of cabinet members is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister and Foreign Minister: Saitō Makoto (75 years old), Minister of Interior: Yamamoto Tatsuo (77 years old), Minister of Finance: Takahashi Korekiyo (79 years old), Minister of the Army: Hayashi Senjūrō (59 years old), Minister of the Navy: Okada Keisuke (65 years old), Minister of Justice: Oyama Matsukichi (64 years old), Minister of Education: Hatoyama Ichirō (50 years old), Minister of Agriculture and Forestry: Gotō Fumio (49 years old), Minister of Commerce and Industry: Nakajima Kumakichi (62 years old), Minister of Railways: Mitsuchi Chūzō (62 years old), Minister of Communications: Minami Hiroshi (64 years old), Minister of Colonial Affairs: Nagai Ryūtarō (52 years old), Chief Cabinet Secretary: Shibata Zensaburō (55 years old), Director-General of the Legislation Bureau: Horikiri Zennosuke (49 years old), Governor-General of Taiwan: Kodama Hideo.</p>
<p>Saitō will present the list of cabinet members to the Emperor for approval tomorrow. Therefore, the inauguration ceremony for the new cabinet members is scheduled for 2:00 PM tomorrow (the 26th).</p>
<p>Far East News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: Since being ordered to form a cabinet, the new Japanese Prime Minister, Saitō, has been very careful, especially considering the current international situation. The position of Foreign Minister is of utmost importance. Saitō considered potential successors and telegraphed Uchida Kōsai, the current President of the South Manchuria Railway, inviting him to join the cabinet as Foreign Minister. President Uchida declined, stating that he was not capable of undertaking such a heavy responsibility and that the South Manchuria Railway was currently expanding various projects, making it difficult for him to leave. He sent a telegram to Saitō this afternoon, declining the offer. Therefore, the position of Foreign Minister has been temporarily decided to be concurrently held by the Prime Minister. In the future, Baron Tsuneo Matsudaira, the Ambassador to Great Britain, is being considered as a successor. Minister of the Interior Yamamoto Tatsuo is an elder statesman of the Minseitō, and is held in high regard within the party. He himself was quite modest about the position of Minister of the Interior. However, after Wakatsuki, the president of Minseitō, and dozens of young members of the party, who desired that Yamamoto come forward, gathered at Yamamoto's private residence this afternoon and urged him strongly, Yamamoto formally replied to Saitō at 6:30 PM, accepting the cabinet position. Admiral Okada, the Minister of the Navy, is a veteran of the naval community, and has long been considered the most suitable candidate for the next Minister of the Navy. Hatoyama Ichirō will remain as Minister of Education. Hatoyama is a key figure in the Suzuki faction of the Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government Association), and is one of the "three musketeers" of the Suzuki faction. His mother, Haruko, is an elder stateswoman in the education community, and he owes much of his prominence in the education community to his mother's assistance. Mitsuchi, the Minister of Railways, is known as the financial expert of the Seiyūkai, and is a protégé of Takahashi. He served as Minister of Education in the Tanaka cabinet in 1927 and as Minister of Communications in the Inukai cabinet. Oyama, the Minister of Justice, is a giant in the legal community and is currently the Chief Prosecutor. Nagai, the Minister of Colonial Affairs, is currently the Secretary-General of the Minseitō, and served as Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Inukai cabinet. He is known as an eloquent speaker. Nakajima, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, is a businessman and a member of the Kōseikai (Fair Politics Association) in the House of Peers. Takahashi, the Minister of Finance, was the Minister of Finance in the Inukai cabinet. After Inukai's death, he temporarily served as Prime Minister. He is an elder statesman in the Seiyūkai and the oldest financial expert in Japan. He has served as President of the Bank of Japan, President of Yokohama Specie Bank, Prime Minister in 1921, and has also served as Minister of Agriculture and Commerce and four terms as Minister of Finance. He is now rejoining the cabinet to take charge of the treasury. Gotō, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, is a member of the House of Peers and has served as Chief of General Affairs of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office. Minami, the Minister of Communications, is a member of the House of Peers and has served as Vice-Minister of Education. He was appointed Governor-General of Taiwan this year. General Hayashi, the Minister of the Army, is currently the Commander of the Korean Army. In 1923, he attended the League of Nations as the Japanese Army representative. He has also served as Commander of the Tokyo Bay Fortress, President of the Army War College, and Director of the Education Directorate. In 1929, he served as Commander of the Konoe Division. He is a powerful general in the army. In total, the cabinet consists of eleven members, excluding the Foreign Minister, who is concurrently held by the Prime Minister. Four members belong to the Seiyūkai, two belong to the Minseitō, three belong to the House of Peers, and one each belongs to the Army and Navy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th: The new government's foreign policy will largely be the same as that of the Seiyūkai government, so it makes no difference who is in charge of foreign affairs.</p>
<h3>Important Political Meeting at French Presidential Palace</h3>
<p>Herriot Temporarily in Charge of Cabinet Affairs</p>
<p>New Government to be Formed Next Month</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 24th: An important political meeting was held at the Presidential Palace this afternoon. Prime Minister Tardieu, Finance Minister Flandin, and other cabinet members were present, and Édouard Herriot, leader of the Radical Socialist Party, also attended. There was a lengthy discussion on foreign affairs and domestic finances. Herriot's new cabinet cannot be formed until the National Assembly convenes, so Tardieu will continue to hold office temporarily, but without authority. France's budget deficit is very large, and the trade balance is increasingly out of balance, so financial issues are currently the most important events in French politics. The new government may be formed by the end of the first week of June, and the Lausanne reparations conference will open on June 16, so the new government will only have one week to seek the confidence of the National Assembly before sending representatives to Lausanne. It is expected that Herriot's cabinet members will mostly be members of the Radical Party, and will include representatives from the Painlevé and Left Center parties. This is because the Socialist Party is demanding a reduction in military spending, the nationalization of insurance, and the creation of poor relief funds as conditions for joining the new cabinet. It is reported that Herriot is unwilling to proceed so abruptly, and has turned to the Painlevé and Left Center parties for their support, in order to gain a majority in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 24th: Edouard Herriot, leader of the Radical Party, has today temporarily taken charge of French cabinet affairs. However, this is an informal assumption of office, and Herriot may specialize in the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs without forming a new cabinet himself. Today's informal ceremony was held at the Presidential Palace.</p>
<h3>Turkish Prime Minister Arrives in Rome</h3>

<h3>Turmoil in the Prussian Parliament</h3>
<p>Polar Opposites Trade Insults</p>
<p>Early Signs of Future Political Upheaval</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 24th: Since the election of the new Prussian parliament, it has been widely expected to be a new center of upheaval in German domestic politics. As expected, only half an hour after the inaugural meeting was held today, disturbances occurred several times in a row, as if foreshadowing a major future turmoil. The German people, aware of this, are paying close attention to the new parliament. The gallery was already packed before the meeting began. Of course, the eyes of the attendees were all focused on the seats of the National Socialist Party. However, at the beginning, not a single one was present in the party seats. It was not until the meeting was about to begin that 162 deputies entered the chamber in formation. At that moment, cheers of welcome and jeers from the left wing made noise at the same time. Prince Wilhelm, the fourth son of the deposed German Emperor, who has always been known as a stalwart of the National Socialist movement, was especially the target of attack by the communist deputies. Today's inaugural meeting of the new parliament was chaired by General Litzmann, a highly respected member of the National Socialist Party, who is 84 years old. A famous general of the Eastern European battlefield. As soon as the opening ceremony was over, the Communist Party immediately launched an offensive, proposing a motion of no confidence in Chancellor Braun, the acting Prime Minister of Prussia. They also demanded that the parliament immediately discuss the issue of unemployment relief. However, both motions were rejected on procedural grounds, as the parliament decided that it must first elect the speaker, deputy speaker, and other officers before it could proceed with the agenda. At that time, the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party engaged in fierce debates, mutually accusing each other of deceiving the unemployed. After the two motions were rejected, the Communist Party deputies stated that they would still propose the same motion tomorrow. The National Socialist Party also stated that the party had already prepared a similar motion, which would be continued tomorrow when the speaker, deputy speaker, and other officials are elected.</p>
<h3>Negotiations Based on Principle of Equality</h3>
<p>German Foreign Affairs Committee Passes Resolution</p>
<p>Geneva Conference Will be Affected</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 24th: Today, the German National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee passed an important resolution that is expected to have a significant impact on the future trends of the Geneva Conference. Before this case was decided, German Chancellor Brüning had given a long speech on the disarmament conference and the reparations issue. However, because the conference situation was strictly confidential, there was no way to find out what Brüning said. Only the full text of the resolution has been published. The content firmly advocates that Germany should exert all its efforts to use the principle of equality as the basis for all negotiations in Geneva, claiming that the principle of equality has so far only been theoretical, and this time it must be shown in practice. It is rumored that this case was proposed by the National Socialist Party, and after being revised by the Bavarian People's Party, it was unanimously passed in the committee today.</p>
<h3>European Countries Will Sign Debt Repayment Agreements</h3>
<p>with US Government</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 25th: Several foreign governments, including Great Britain, will soon sign an agreement with the US government on the repayment of $252 million in defaulted war debts. According to this clause, the debt is related to the extension of twelve months that President Hoover agreed to last year.

There are no formal letters from other relevant countries.</p>
<p>Important News: Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on the Perilous State of Japanese-American War Machines</p>
<p>(Continuation 3)</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the "Manchurian Crisis," as the Americans called it, in September of last year, I paid close attention to the actions of the United States. At that time, I discovered an unexpected phenomenon, namely, the United States announced its strange opinions at this time. At that time, China sought help from the League of Nations, and the United States, standing outside the League of Nations and acting independently, declared that it would cooperate with the League of Nations. At the same time, it joined the League of Nations, and consistently used an attitude of oppressing Japan to comment on the Manchurian issue. However, clear-headed American diplomats did not find the attitude of the American government to be strange. From the time of President Cleveland to the time of McKinley, in order to protect its own interests and implement its own claims, the United States often used strong-arm tactics abroad. For example, during the heyday of the British Empire, US Secretary of State Olney intervened in the Caribbean Sea issue. When he met with British Foreign Secretary Salisbury, his arrogance was as if there was no one else present. As a result, he was ultimately unable to subdue the other party. This is one example.</p>
<p>When the Manchurian Incident broke out, Stimson's diplomacy towards Japan, self-consciously standing in the position of a great power, upheld its own traditional position and submitted a note to Japan. However, the content of the note was in the nature of a letter of recommendation. For if Japan and the United States separated the buffer zone of the so-called League of Nations and handled the Manchurian Incident separately, a head-on collision would inevitably occur. Therefore, the United States government and other politicians mostly expressed a lukewarm attitude. In particular, the arguments in the American press originally represented the aspirations of the entire United States. After the Manchurian Incident, public opinion towards Japan was very inconsistent. Like the Manchester Guardian in England, which insulted Japan with abusive language and excluded Japan, were still rare. Among them, only the New York Evening Post and the New York World News were relatively intense. When they heard of the Manchurian Incident, they immediately discredited Japan as a barbaric country. The actions of the Japanese army were completely similar to the actions of barbarians, and even bitterly scolded the Japanese militarist policy of aggression. But there were also several newspapers on the other side that vigorously defended Japan. Later, when the issue of economic sanctions arose, it was generally believed in the country that "economic sanctions against a powerful country would induce a world war." The New York News also had two factions on this issue, one advocating it and one opposing it. As public opinion was not unified, the government's policy was difficult to decide. Now, from my personal point of view, observing the situation in the United States and guessing the true intentions of the United States government, there is a big gap between them. Why? Listening to its statements and reading its notes, although they seemed to strongly pretend to be very calm and moderate in tone, their bones actually contained the meaning of oppression, and words of dissatisfaction overflowed. And the tone often used by Secretary of State Stimson really opened up a new and strange precedent in American diplomatic documents. For its arrogant and disrespectful words and deeds, it wanted to oppress the world with its towering power, conceal its own essential nature, and exert a surprising self-control, which was obviously impossible to conceal.</p>
<p>Looking back at October of last year, on American Navy Day, the chairman of the Senate Naval Committee gave a speech on the current situation of the three major naval powers, Britain, the United States, and Japan, and compared the existing power of the navies of the United States and Japan, saying that Japan's naval power was stronger than that of the United States. At the same time, he discussed the current Manchurian Incident, attacking and criticizing Japan's Manchurian policy with all his might. Among them, there were words such as "because the current naval power of the United States cannot control Japan's actions, it is necessary to recover them." From this, we can know that the United States today still dares not actively interfere in Japan's actions. If it wants to interfere in Japan's actions, it has to cause a war. If it wants war, it must not have a superior naval power, and if it wants to prepare a superior navy, it cannot be done in one or two months. This is why the United States is bluffing and only making threatening gestures. Stimson, however, does not understand the situation and incites provocation. It is not worth the laugh of connoisseurs.</p>
<h3>Plan to Convert Hangzhou Mint into Arsenal Abandoned</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Due to the Shanghai Incident, our army withdrew from Longhua. The military department had transported parts of the arsenal's machinery to Zhejiang, and planned to move the factory to Hangzhou. Wang Zuyao, chairman of the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce, sent a letter to Chen Yi, Vice Minister of Military Affairs, requesting that this plan be abandoned. Yesterday, he received a reply from Chen, saying that the plan had been abandoned. The exchange of letters is recorded as follows: (1) Wang's letter to Chen Yi said, "Recently, Mr. Guo, the director of the arsenal, brought foreign technicians to Hangzhou to inspect the Hangzhou Mint. It is said that it is planned to convert it into a part of the arsenal. The merchants and residents here are quite alarmed and have come to inquire. Upon investigation, the Hangzhou Mint is located on West Avenue, the provincial capital, and is densely populated. It is also adjacent to a girls' middle school and is very close to the New Market. It is not appropriate to build a dangerous arsenal in a prosperous urban area. I hope that you will care for your hometown and resolutely request that this plan be abandoned. In addition to the city chamber of commerce submitting a request to Chairman Lu of the Zhejiang Provincial Government to telegraph your department, I urge you to strongly preside over the matter, hoping to cancel this move before it is done." (2) Chen Yi's reply to Wang's letter said, "The plan to convert the mint into an arsenal has now been abandoned. I hereby inform you of this, so as to relieve your concerns." (25th)</p>

<h3>Fengjing Station Master Injured in Rescue Attempt</h3>
<p>Yesterday (24th), at approximately 2:00 PM, the 33rd Special Express Train from Hangzhou to Shanghai was passing through Fengjing Station. Station Master Yang Qiyuan was performing his duties when the train sped past. Suddenly, four passengers in uniform jumped from the train. The station master tried to stop them, but they refused and jumped down, crashing into the station master. The station master took the brunt of the impact and broke his leg. He lost consciousness and is now being treated at Jiaxing Hospital.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Industries Assist Postal Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>After receiving news of the Shanghai postal workers' strike, the local postal workers' union immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Communications, requesting the adoption of the postal workers' union's proposal to consolidate the postal base. The banking and other 23 trade associations also believe that this matter is of great importance to commercial transportation, and jointly sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce. On the 23rd, they telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to provide assistance in order to avoid escalating the situation.</p>
<h3>5th Army Ordered to Depart</h3>
<p>The 88th and 87th Divisions of the 5th Army, which participated in the Shanghai anti-Japanese war, have been stationed in Changshu and Wuxian counties since the end of the war. They have now been ordered to depart. The brigades and regiments of the 88th Division departed for Nanjing on the 22nd and will transfer to Hankou.

<h3>Wuxi Jiangsu Province to Impose Special Business Tax</h3>
<p>The financial situation of the Jiangsu Provincial Government remains difficult, and the collection of business taxes has not improved. Therefore, following the example of Hubei and other provinces, a special business tax will be implemented. The scope of collection will be based on eight categories: bamboo and wood, paper, cotton, silk cocoons, north-south goods, coal, beans, and oil. The tax rate will be 20 per thousand of the price. Tax bureaus will be established at major ports to collect the tax. The original business tax will be changed to a business license tax. The regulations are currently being drafted and are scheduled to take effect on July 1st. According to Chairman Gu, the special business tax will only be collected once and will not be collected repeatedly. Therefore, it is different from the collection of arrearage fees, and it is also different from the ordinary business tax. It is defined as the whole number of the tax to be levied first, rather than the odd numbers to be levied after the business.</p>
<h3>Robberies Occur in City and Countryside</h3>
<p>Ding Zixiu, a 63-year-old resident of Changan Bridge Heng Street outside the North Gate, has a modest family fortune and lives comfortably. Suddenly, at approximately 2:00 AM yesterday (25th), five bandits arrived, wearing short clothes and carrying bayonets, bamboo poles, and other items. They first went to Zixiu's room, where two bandits dragged his wife, Mrs. Lu (56 years old), out of bed, tied her up with strips of cloth torn from a bed sheet, and then tied Zixiu up on the bed. The remaining three bandits then rummaged through boxes and chests, looting for approximately two hours before fleeing with their loot. When the bandits were about to leave, they stabbed Zixiu twice in the neck with a bayonet, causing the wounds to pass through both sides. Blood flowed profusely, and he lost consciousness. Afterward, his family members carried the injured person to Puren Hospital for treatment. Also, the homes of Lu Jubao and Lu Hebao, residents of Funan Township in the 9th District of the county, were robbed by more than ten bandits the night before last, who stole six or seven piculs of rice, more than ten items of clothing, and silver dollars, with an estimated loss of more than two hundred yuan. Also, the home of Zheng Aihe in Zhengjiatang in the same district was robbed of clothing, silver dollars, and other items at approximately 10:00 PM on the 21st, with losses estimated at more than one hundred yuan. The 10th Bureau of the Public Security Bureau has arrested four suspects, Hu Agui, Zou Arong, Wu Haoquan, and Chen Jingen, who are currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Houch Sheng Silk Factory</h3>
<p>The Housheng Silk Factory, located at Nancangmen outside the East Gate, was founded by Mr. Jun Chongli with invested capital. It has 208 Italian-style silk reeling machines. Due to the tragic decline in the silk market, it suffered from poor capital turnover and was forced to declare a shutdown in October of last year. As the fresh silkworm cocoons are about to enter the market, in order to maintain the livelihood of the workers, it is planned to find ways to resume production. Manager Feng Meisheng, Zhang Yongqing, and others consulted to select female workers, and created 208 admission cards, ordering car manager Jiang Jianming to distribute them to the female workers. New female workers account for four-tenths of the total, and old female workers account for six-tenths, which aroused dissatisfaction among the old female workers who did not receive admission cards. Yesterday (24th) morning at 5:00 AM was the date for the factory to resume work. Manager Dan feared an accident and entrusted Wu Liansheng and Ding Zhaochu, two staff members of the silk factory trade union, to monitor the factory gate and collect admission cards. At the time, there were more than 200 female workers at the gate, and their momentum was fierce, intending to disturb the factory. Seeing this, Wu and Ding stepped forward to persuade them, but the female workers beat Wu and Ding severely, and then destroyed all the doors, windows, and walls. Seeing the poor situation, the factory immediately closed the factory gate and reported to the 1st Police Station of the 2nd Branch of the Public Security Bureau by telephone. After receiving the report, the police station immediately sent a patrolman to suppress the situation. At the same time, the police brigade also received the news and rushed to the scene, but the female workers had already dispersed and their whereabouts were unknown. Afterwards, the Silk Adjustment Committee sent representatives Ji Xiansan to the county government to report the situation to County Chief Chen and request the arrest of the leading perpetrators. County Chief Chen was furious upon receiving the report and immediately issued a handwritten order to the Public Security Bureau to send police to investigate and arrest them. It is reported that Wu Guangtao, the ringleader, has been apprehended and taken to the bureau for interrogation. The Housheng Silk Factory has now been postponed to the 28th to resume work.</p>
<h3>News After Changzhou Postal Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>In order to support the postal foundation plan, postal workers in Wu County went on strike on the 24th. Declarations of the strike were issued to all sectors of society. The original executive supervisory committee of the 3rd Postal Workers' Union has resigned en masse. In the future, the strike committee will continue to be responsible, and expressed that the four methods recently advocated by the Shanghai postal workers were unanimously supported, believing that the attitude was bright and it was a good way to solve the labor unrest this time.</p>
<h3>Suicide of a Young Couple in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Two young male and female travelers suddenly arrived at the Central Hotel on Yanling Road in the Xishi Market of Hangzhou on the 23rd. They claimed to be a married couple and booked room number 32. The two were inseparable, going in and out together, appearing deeply in love. Unexpectedly, at around 9 o'clock last night (the 24th), the waiter noticed they hadn't ordered dinner. He knocked on the door of the adjacent room, but received no response. He pushed the door open and found both the man and woman had taken sleeping pills. The man's face was pale and he was in a coma, while the woman had ingested less and was still able to speak. The waiter immediately reported to the police station, who transferred the patients to the hospital for treatment. It is unlikely their lives are in danger. There were three suicide notes, one addressed to the man's father, a timber merchant in their hometown of Songjiang, detailing their desire to commit suicide due to lack of freedom in marriage; one to the hotel owner; and one to his sister, Hui Fang, expressing farewell. It is reported that the male guest's name is Zhou Dao, and he and the accompanying woman, Zhang Jingfang, had fallen deeply in love and freely married, but were opposed by their parents, so they came to Hangzhou together to commit suicide.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Postal Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Postal Workers' Federation, in order to support the plan to consolidate the postal service foundation and respond to the postal rescue movement in Shanghai, initiated a strike at 6:00 AM on the 24th, completely halting postal traffic. Upon receiving the news, the provincial government dispatched Mayor Zhao Zhiyou to join forces with Postmaster An Runnong to find ways to mediate and persuade the workers to resume work, but to no avail. According to the workers, this strike is to save the entire postal crisis and is not for the private interests of postal workers. The issue cannot be resolved locally. If the plan proposed by the general union is accepted by the ministry, work can be resumed immediately. It is learned that employees in major postal ports in Zhejiang Province, such as Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Shaoxing, are also taking unified action. Many local branch offices have stopped work following the orders of the Hangzhou General Union, blocking mail traffic. The Provincial Public Security Bureau has dispatched police to various offices to maintain order to prevent accidents.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<p>Bai Chuan Still Not Out of Danger Yesterday</p>
<p>Relying on Various Medicines to Sustain His Life</p>
<p>Rumors of Death Shock the World</p>
<p>Japanese military commander Bai Chuan Yi Ze's condition is critical. Doctor Hoteng performed an abdominal surgery the day before, discovering that Bai Chuan's illness was malignant kidney ulcer. The festering growth was cut out. Although the process was good, the doctor said there was a glimmer of hope. Bai Chuan slept slightly last night, and military doctors returned to their rooms to sleep. The Japanese military hospital was very quiet, but according to the general Japanese opinion, Bai Chuan's life is still not out of danger. Currently, his life is being sustained by blood transfusions and injections of Ringer's glucose solution, painkillers, and cardiotonics. According to Shanghai news from the Electric News Agency, as of 10:00 AM on the 25th, the military medical department announced that General Bai Chuan's condition was as follows: At 6:00 PM on the 24th, body temperature was 37.2 degrees, pulse 120, respiration 24. At 6:00 AM on the 25th, 37.3, 108, 25. Apart from feeling thirsty and pain in the wound, there were no subjective symptoms. He could not sleep well last night. There were no signs of peritonitis. The postoperative progress was good. A subcutaneous injection of Ringer's glucose solution, injections of painkillers and cardiotonics, and oxygen inhalation were administered last night. The pulse was relatively good. A three-point enema of Ringer's solution was performed this morning. Yesterday's surgery involved cutting open part of the stomach and duodenum, followed by gastrointestinal anastomosis. There was a circular ulcer larger than a copper coin on the small curve of the stomach. At the bottom was an opening of an artery with an inner diameter of two millimeters. Anemia was high, and the general condition was very critical. The National News Agency London reported on the 24th that the rumors of death regarding Japanese General Bai Chuan's injuries have attracted special attention from newspapers around the world and have become good material for competition between several newspapers and news agencies in mutually hostile positions. At least one famous American news agency and one famous British news agency have falsely reported his death. Also, one famous French news agency even transmitted twice within two days. As a result, news agencies around the world falsely reported his death, and there were inquiries to verify the truth, even as far away as the capital of Argentina, inquiring to London. Such repeated false reports of death have never been seen before, so usually such news rarely attracts attention, and in newspapers, it may not necessarily occupy a position, but now it has shocked the world.</p>
<h3>Four Important Groups Initiate Movement to Abolish Civil War</h3>
<p>Organizing a Grand Alliance</p>
<p>In View of the Seriousness of Internal and External Troubles</p>
<p>Aiming to Achieve Internal Peace and External Resistance</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Banking Association, and the Money Trade Association issued a joint telegram yesterday initiating the Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance, which reads: To the Nanjing, Guangzhou, Peiping, Hankou, Tianjin, and Hangzhou Chambers of Commerce, Banking Associations, and Money Trade Associations, and forwarded to all gentlemen and to the Chambers of Commerce, Banking Associations, and Money Trade Associations of all provinces and counties, this is for your consideration. In view of the seriousness of internal and external troubles, we specially initiate the Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance in order to achieve internal peace and external resistance, and have drafted ten articles of association: (1) This alliance believes that external aggression stems from internal strife, and internal strife stems from civil war. We hereby gather the people of the whole country to conduct a movement to abolish civil war. (2) The movement of this alliance to abolish civil war shall be carried out in the following order: (A) In peacetime, this alliance should issue public writings or speeches, stating the sins of civil war and developing the benefits of peace. (B) If political disputes arise that may cause civil war, this alliance should advise both parties to trust a certain public opinion organization (before the establishment of a formal national representative organization, legally recognized non-governmental professional organizations can be substituted) to mediate. Neither party shall absolutely resolve the issue by force. (C) If, unfortunately, civil war does occur, the group members and individual members of this alliance should unanimously refuse to cooperate and may even adopt peaceful and appropriate methods to stop it. (3) This alliance shall not engage in any other activities except for the movement to abolish civil war. (4) Anyone who agrees with the purpose of this alliance, regardless of individual, group, gender, occupation, or party affiliation, and without the need for an introduction, may sign up to join and be publicly announced by this alliance. (5) This alliance may establish a general office in Shanghai and may establish branch offices in necessary locations. (6) This alliance may establish several standing committee members, with a term of one year, to form a standing committee to discuss and manage all affairs of this alliance. Due to the large number of members and the vast area, it is difficult to convene a general meeting. For the sake of simple and convenient procedures, the number and selection of the first standing committee members shall be determined and publicly elected by the initiators. From the second term onwards, it shall be determined and publicly elected by the standing committee. When necessary, administrative staff may be established, also to be selected and appointed by the standing committee. (7) This alliance may establish several honorary committee members, to be nominated by the standing committee. (8) This alliance does not collect membership fees, and its expenses may be raised through donations from supporting groups and individuals, but it may not request subsidies from the central and local governments or any public institutions. (9) All procedural rules of this alliance shall be formulated by the standing committee. (10) The term of establishment of this alliance is tentatively set at five years, but if a civil war occurs before the deadline, and it is deemed unnecessary to continue the movement to abolish it, it may be resolved in advance. If you agree, please reply by telegram. Sincerely, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Banking Association, and the Money Trade Association.</p>
<h3>Long-Distance Telephone Service Between Nanjing and Shanghai Reopened</h3>
<p>Reuters reported from Nanjing on the 25th that the long-distance telephone service between Nanjing and Shanghai, which had been cut off in January, was reopened today. It is said that a temporary line has been installed connecting Chenlongtan and the Shanghai Public Concession through Nanshi, so that traffic can be restored as soon as possible. As for the original line in Zhabei, it is still under repair, but it can also be completed in one or two days.</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River is Rising at an Astonishing Rate</h3>
<p>Exceeding Thirty-Three Feet</p>
<p>In recent days, heavy rain has been continuous, and the Yangtze River has risen sharply again, causing panic among the people of Wuhan. In recent days, the water level has risen even more, and the Jiangmian River in Hankou has exceeded 32 feet, in direct proportion to last year's great flood in Wuhan, causing even more panic among the people. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>The Course of Rising Water</h3>
<p>At the beginning of April this year, the river water was only about twelve or thirteen feet, but by late April, it had gradually increased to sixteen feet. The water rose the fastest in May, especially from the 5th to the 22nd. In these seventeen days, it rose more than fourteen feet in total. According to the customs water level report, the water level was eighteen feet six inches on May 5, nineteen feet five inches on the 6th, twenty feet eight inches on the 7th, twenty feet three inches on the 8th, twenty-one feet three inches on the 9th, and twenty-three feet on the 10th. It rose to twenty-four feet two inches on the 11th, twenty-four feet six inches on the 12th, twenty-five feet six inches on the 13th, twenty-five feet nine inches on the 14th, twenty-six feet five inches on the 15th, twenty-seven feet four inches on the 16th, twenty-nine feet six inches on the 18th, thirty feet five inches on the 19th, thirty-one feet three inches on the 20th, and thirty-two feet on the 22nd. The water volume surged in the ten days after the 12th, increasing by almost one foot per day. As of yesterday, the 25th, it was said to have risen to thirty-three feet six inches.</p>
<h3>Review of Last Year's Flood</h3>
<p>Last year's flood in Wuhan was exactly the same as this year's rising water, which also started in May. Last year, the Jiang River in Wuhan was initially very shallow. Hankou, Jiujiang, Wuxue, and other places were only between nine and ten feet. Large ships could not pass, and eight or nine ships were stranded. Until May, there was a sudden heavy rain, and the river water suddenly rose. On May 3, it had risen to twenty-eight feet eight inches, and on May 21, it rose to thirty-five feet. By mid-July, the water had reached the same level as the river surface. On August 2, the flood submerged Wuhan, and there were seven or eight feet of water in the city. Pedestrians traveled by boat, and the water level reached fifty-three feet six inches. All the ports along the river were submerged in water, resulting in an unprecedented disaster.</p>
<h3>Already Reached Last Year's Water Level</h3>
<p>The Jiang River in Wuhan has been rising rapidly day and night, and the rain has not stopped. Fortunately, the rising rate in the upper reaches is not as fast as last year. The Wuhan River above Hankou is still able to maintain the sixteen-foot water mark, so that the lower reaches will not increase further. Yesterday, a certain merchant in Shanghai received a telegram from Hankou, saying that the height of the water in Hankou on the 24th and 25th was only a little more than one foot different from the same time last year, and the water marks from last year are still there. All sectors of the three towns, in view of the daily increase in the past two weeks, are very frightened, fearing that if the water continues to rise as rapidly in the next two weeks as it has in the past two weeks, the water will enter the city again, and the disaster of last year will not be difficult to see again today.</p>
<h3>Riverside Wharves and Warehouses Raised</h3>
<p>The wharves and warehouses of various shipping companies are all along the river. After being flooded last year, the wharves and warehouses were raised to prevent the flood from rushing in. Recently, due to the heavy floods in Hankou, various shipping companies have ordered the speed of the ships to be reduced to prevent collisions. The embankments under construction are also adding high embankments to the lower layers of the warehouses as a precaution against floods.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers</h3>
<p>To Be Held in Suzhou the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Initiates Preparations</p>
<p>The memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the Songhu War of Resistance will be held in Suzhou the day after tomorrow. All groups participating in the memorial service should report the name of the group, the name of the leader, and the number of participants to the Shanghai Preparatory Office. The deadline was yesterday. However, various groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have initiated a memorial service in Shanghai, and a preparatory meeting is scheduled to be held today. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>The Whole Country Flies Flags at Half-Mast to Express Sorrow</h3>
<p>The municipal government issued an order to various bureaus yesterday, stating that in order to comply with the matter, the Executive Yuan President Wang Hao telegraphed that the 19th Route Army will hold a memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the Songhu War of Resistance in Suzhou on the 28th of this month. On that day, the whole country should fly flags at half-mast for one day to express sorrow. I respectfully order that the bureau comply and order its subordinates to comply. This order.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Initiates Preparations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal People's Federation, and the General Association of Business Circles of Various Roads telegraphed the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Naval Headquarters, the Local Court, the Special Zone One and Two Courts, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office, the China Merchants Bureau, the Postal Bureau, the Two-Road Administration Bureau, the Red Cross Society, the General Labor Union, the Women's Relief Association, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the University Federation, the Middle School Federation, the Fire Fighting Federation, the Teachers' Federation, the Lawyers' Association, the Accountants' Association, the Boy Scout Council, the 19th Route Army Shanghai Office, the 5th Army Shanghai Office, the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, and other groups, stating: In order to launch the first preparatory meeting for the memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the War of Resistance against Japan, we have scheduled the meeting for 2:00 PM on the 26th of this month (Thursday) on the third floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. We will also elect preparatory members to be responsible for preparing everything. At that time, we hope that you will send one or two representatives to attend. The matter concerns the glorification of loyalty and martyrdom, and we hope that you will participate. We are extremely grateful.</p>
<h3>Yang Xingfo's Suggestions for the Noulens Case</h3>
<p>Advocating for the Amnesty of Political Prisoners and Freedom of Thought Yang Xingfo wrote to the Central Political Conference regarding the Noulens case, stating: To the gentlemen of the Central Political Conference, the Noulens case originated in British Singapore and was arrested in the Shanghai Public Concession. After a year of trial, it has caused a stir overseas. Scholars from various countries, such as Einstein, Dewey, and Rolland, have specially organized an international rescue committee to engage in rescue efforts. I have heard that some people in the party and the state believe that since Noulens has attracted international attention, he must be an important figure in the Communist Party. Since the National Government has been anti-communist, all those suspected of communism should be punished as much as possible. It is better to punish the innocent than to let one slip through. Moreover, the government has used hundreds of thousands of troops to suppress the Red Army for years, but to no avail. If important communists such as the Noulens are lightly released, how can we face the soldiers who died in the years of anti-communist warfare? I do not know that the strength of the Red Army is due to the indiscriminate killing of communists over the years and the disregard for the suffering of the people. Since returning to Nanjing from Jiangxi last July, after writing about the Red Scourge and China's survival, I have not wanted to speak about politics for a long time. Today, the Red Scourge and national crisis are far greater than last year. The people's psychology has become more intense after being ravaged by the brutal sun, but the leaders of the party and the state still hold the stubborn view that they should not repair internal affairs and rely solely on military suppression of communism. In the past, the society's fear of communism was because they heard that the Red Army had committed murder, arson, rape, and plunder. The government's desire to severely punish the "Communist bandits" also said that the Red Army had committed murder, arson, rape, and plunder. However, based on recent events, the Red Army has changed its policy of trying to destroy and create terror in various places. Instead, those who committed murder, arson, rape, and plunder in the northeast of the three provinces, in Beijiangwan, Wusong, Jiading, were the civilized troops of the Great Japanese Empire, which speaks of friendship. The Three Principles of the People and Communism are not inherently incompatible. The "implementation of Communism" may not be appropriate today, but a faithful analysis of the doctrine and platform of the Chinese Kuomintang must lead to the conclusion that the Chinese Kuomintang is a revolutionary party that advocates national socialism. Therefore, in terms of doctrine, believers in Communism should have freedom of speech and thought in a country of the Three Principles of the People. In terms of behavior, since we are submitting to and seeking peace with the Japanese army, which is committing murder, arson, rape, and plunder, asking them to withdraw, why can we not release a leftist international scholar who is being framed by British imperialists and has no ability to resist? The giants of the party and the state are constantly conquering each other and cooperating. I have not heard of any uneasiness about the soldiers who died in the civil war. Why is it that when asking for the pardon of a leftist scholar, the feeling in one's heart is that it is for the soldiers who died in the anti-communist warfare? Disturbing the people's minds causes chaos, and the Red Scourge spreads, and the civil war is endless. All of this is due to this one thought. What I have said above should not only be the case for the Noulens couple, but also for all people who hold different political views from the government. Since the Fourth Plenary Session, the government has repeatedly spoken of a general amnesty for political prisoners, but so far, it has not materialized. In recent years, there have been countless young people who dared to speak out for the country and forgot themselves, who have been haggardly killed by dark clerks in the hands of those who want to gain credit and rewards. The government authorities should not destroy and eradicate the future vitality and the driving force for improvement of the nation and mankind, even if they hold extreme confidence in the current national affairs. The laissez-faireists of 18th-century Europe and America were able to understand and practice shallow reasoning. How could the believers of the Three Principles of the People not see as far? I hope that the gentlemen will rise up to plan for this, so that future generations will not have the pain of saying that although the Kuomintang did not destroy China, China was actually destroyed by the Republican Party. I respectfully wish you peace, Yang Quan, May 25, 21st year.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Honolulu Concerned About the Motherland</h3>
<p>Destroying Homes to Relieve Difficulties</p>
<p>Actively Raising Money</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from the Zhengfu Republican Bank in Honolulu, Honolulu Island yesterday, stating that the overseas Chinese in the island are loyal to the motherland and actively raising money. Overseas Chinese often remit large sums of money back to the country to fund various relief expenses. Everyone knows this, but it seems that newspaper reports have rarely recorded the repeated telegraphic remittances of large sums of money by overseas Chinese in Honolulu. It is found that in the past two and a half months, overseas Chinese in Honolulu have remitted more than 400,000 Mexican dollars to Shanghai to support the 19th Route Army or to relieve refugees. Some of this money was directly remitted to General Cai Tingkai of the 19th Route Army and Director Fan Qiwu, some was remitted to the Ministry of Finance, some was remitted to the Shanghai Banking Association, the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Relief Association, and the Red Cross Society, and some was remitted to Mayor Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai and other well-known enthusiastic public figures. Even the amount remitted by the Zhengfu Republican Bank in Honolulu reached more than 250,000 yuan, all of which were remitted to the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, the Shanghai agent, for delivery to the recipient. It is also found that in 1930, when several provinces in northern China suffered from drought, overseas Chinese in Honolulu collected 150,000 yuan and remitted it to the Beiping Huayang Yizhen Association. Last year, when central China suffered from floods, they raised 70,000 yuan and remitted it to the Shanghai Huayang Yizhen Association. In the past ten years, the overseas Chinese here have remitted an average of no less than 200,000 yuan per year to Guangdong for schools, hospitals, churches, and relief to the poor. The small number of overseas Chinese in a small island in the Pacific Ocean spared no effort to contribute their hard-earned money to relieve the difficulties of their compatriots in the motherland, which shows their ardent patriotism. Recently, the overseas Chinese in Honolulu have also donated money to purchase a huge building as a gift to the country because the narrow Chinese consulate is not enough for office and to enhance its appearance. The building is a place for consulate personnel to work and live, and its value is also more than 25,000 US dollars.</p>

<h3>Strictly Prohibit the Transportation of Grain to the Puppet State</h3>
<p>The Northeast has fallen, and a puppet state has been established. The Japanese army in that area needs a lot of grain. Some puppet state traitors and local merchants have come to Shanghai privately to purchase grain and food to transport to Guanwai to supply the Japanese army. This matter has been discovered many times, some loaded from the Beining Railway and some shipped to Dalian Bay from merchant ships. The central government has telegraphed the Beining Railway Bureau and various Chinese merchant shipping bureaus in this port to strictly prohibit traitors from transporting food to the Northeast to supply the puppet state. If they knowingly transport it, they will be severely punished and given the punishment they deserve. After this order was issued, it was heard that some traitors were secretly transporting it on foreign merchant ships or Japanese ships to Dalian Bay.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Return Home One After Another, Including Artillery and Infantry Units</h3>
<p>The mountain artillery of the 9th Division of the Japanese Army and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd battalions of the 9th Regiment received orders to withdraw yesterday. They gathered at the Huangpu Wharf at noon. The Japanese Army Ministry sent the transport ship Hankou Maru to load them. Officers and soldiers boarded the ship at 11:00 AM, and more than 20 artillery pieces were also transported. In addition, the 3rd company of the 19th Infantry Regiment and the 1st squadron of the flying corps also returned home on the Hankou Maru. In total, the ship carried more than 2,000 officers and soldiers, as well as a large number of guns and artillery, and four aircraft. It left Shanghai at 11:40 AM and went directly to Japan.</p>
<h3>Army Headquarters</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dispatch Army is scheduled to be completely transported by June 2. All the army headquarters are being closed down. The base of the unit will be returned to the fleet for repatriation. All the officers and staff of the various departments and offices in the headquarters have been scheduled to leave Shanghai on a Japanese ship on June 1. Yesterday, they booked a large number of passenger seats on the Shanghai Maru of the Japanese Postal Company for the headquarters staff to ride home. As for the army air force that has not withdrawn, it will be transferred to the Northeast and is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on June 6.</p>
<h3>Epidemic Prevention Officer Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>In the war zone, epidemics are inevitable. There have been several cases of Japanese soldiers returning home and transmitting epidemics, and Japanese people going to the east from Shanghai and having epidemics. The Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs has specially dispatched Nentaro Katsube, an epidemic prevention officer from the Health Bureau, to come to Shanghai from Japan to specialize in epidemic prevention matters for the army and overseas Chinese.

<h3>Japanese Army Officer Uematsu Boasts</h3>
<p>Saying Three Times the Marines</p>
<p>Is Enough to Fight Ten Times the Chinese Army</p>
<p>According to a Shanghai telegram from the Nagoya Shimbun, Commander Uematsu of the Marine Corps stated that after the Shanghai Army withdrew, in order to protect the safety of residents in Shanghai, the troop strength of the Marine Corps has now been increased to three times that before the incident (before the incident, there were only 800 people, now increased to 2,600 people). Other equipment such as armored vehicles, tanks, and artillery is also sharper than before. Therefore, the local combat capability is not worth worrying about. In the past, due to ignorance of geography and lack of understanding of the situation, we suffered a great loss. With the experience gained in the actual war this time, if another unfortunate incident occurs, I (Uematsu) am confident that I can deal with an enemy ten times or more stronger.</p>
<h3>Korean Residents in the French Concession Safe</h3>
<p>French President Instructs French Consul</p>
<p>To Prohibit Japanese from Arresting People Without Authorization</p>
<p>The Mainland Daily News reported that yesterday (the 24th), according to news from the Korean Association, French President Lebrun has instructed the French Consul General in this port and the French Concession Municipal Council to change the new policy of allowing Japanese to arrest Korean residents in the French Concession, and to restore the old practice of protecting political prisoners in the French Concession. After receiving the news, the association immediately telegraphed the French President to thank him for his protection. It is said that Korean residents, upon hearing this news, have returned to their old homes one after another and are living and working in peace.</p>
<h3>Ahn Chang-ho's Family Hires Lawyers to Rescue Him</h3>
<p>The Mainland Daily News reported that after Korean revolutionary leader Ahn Chang-ho was arrested by the Japanese, his family in the United States hired lawyer A. Qinman in this port to try to rescue him. A. Qinman has repeatedly contacted the Japanese Consul General's Office. Recently, he received a reply from the Japanese authorities, admitting that they have not yet found any evidence that Ahn Chang-ho is related to the Hongkou Park bombing case, but Ahn's detention is due to the fact that he did not register with the consulate and is Korean. According to reports, Ahn has become a citizen of China, while his wife has become a citizen of the United States. She and her four daughters are still in the United States. After lawyer A. Leman in this port was entrusted by Ahn's wife, he immediately began to negotiate with the Japanese Consul General's Office. He told the Japanese authorities that it was surprising that Ahn had been detained for so long for such weak reasons, and demanded that he be released immediately. But in the end, he received the aforementioned reply from the Japanese authorities. While in prison, Ahn has reportedly consistently argued that he has nothing to do with the Hongkou bombing case. It is also reported that lawyer A. Leman has asked the French authorities for assistance in negotiating to retrieve Ahn Chang-ho's certificate of Chinese citizenship, which was confiscated by the Japanese authorities, but so far there has been no effect. Yesterday, it was also claimed that the US authorities are paying close attention to this case. It is also said that the US Consul General's Office in this port has received a telegram from Washington regarding this case.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Traffic Conditions on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>Difficult Recovery at Wusong Depot</p>
<p>Regarding the Beijing-Shanghai trains of the two railway bureaus, yesterday from the North Station to Nanjing, only the 11:00 AM slow train and the 3:45 PM special express train each departed once. However, the number of passengers was more crowded than the previous day. A total of over 2,500 yuan in tickets was sold in the morning and about 2,000 yuan in the afternoon, with a total of over 2,000 passengers. It is expected that today will be even more crowded. Chief of the Traffic Department, Zheng Baozhao, has scheduled an additional 7:00 AM early train today to facilitate travel. As for the two passenger trains from Beijing to Shanghai at 7:30 AM and 11:30 AM yesterday, they both arrived in Shanghai on time at 4:44 PM and 9:05 PM, respectively, with a total of over 1,500 passengers. Harris, the Chief of the Accounting Department of the two railway bureaus, and Hu Wenyuan, the Deputy Chief, inspected the ticket office upon their return to Shanghai from Anting at 3:30 PM, examining the number of tickets sold yesterday. They also learned that the Wusong Depot under the jurisdiction of the railway is still within the Japanese military zone and cannot be recovered immediately. Moreover, the machinery in the depot and various locomotives and vehicles along the railway have been severely damaged and cannot be repaired within a few months. Judging from the extent of the damage to the North Vehicle Depot, all the buildings, machinery, tools, and materials have been destroyed or stolen and must be re-equipped. It is estimated that this arrangement and reorganization will take a considerable amount of time.</p>

<h3>New Water Regulations Issue</h3>
<p>Municipal Council Claims Users Misunderstand</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Refutes Based on Facts</p>
<p>The revised new regulations for tap water in the Public Concession, the minimum water fee according to the water meter is much higher than the usual package water system, which affects the livelihood of the common people, so it has aroused opposition from the general public. After the Chinese Taxpayers' Association and others negotiated with the Municipal Council, yesterday the Municipal Council replied to the Taxpayers' Association, saying that it was a misunderstanding by the users. The Taxpayers' Association then replied to the Municipal Council based on the records of the blank contracts of the water company, requesting it to investigate the truth. The original letters are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Letter from the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Regarding your letter of May 13th, forwarding the letter from Mr. Wu Lihua concerning tap water charges, it appears that Mr. Wu is not entirely clear on this issue. The approved water meter rates are listed below: "For users using no more than 10,000 gallons per month, the fee is 6.25 yuan per water meter. If, according to the company's intention, this minimum price is still based on the reason for reduction, it will be calculated according to the following price list:" (For users using no more than 5,000 gallons per month, the fee is 3.25 yuan per two-inch water meter.) (For users using no more than 3,000 gallons per month, the fee is 1.875 yuan per one-and-a-half-inch water meter.) (For users using no more than 2,000 gallons per month, the fee is 1.25 yuan per half-inch to one-and-a-quarter-inch water meter. Whenever the minimum water fee (i.e., 6.25 yuan) set by the water meter calculation is higher than the water fee calculated based on the user's rent, the aforementioned reduction method can be applied. Your letter did not mention the user's address, so it is impossible to investigate thoroughly. However, in such cases, you can ask the Shanghai Water Company to review it, and all misunderstandings can be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Taxpayers' Association</h3>
<p>Dear Sirs, We have received your reply No. 1408 of May 18th regarding the water fee, and we are informed. If your bureau already knows the regulations on water fee provisions on the blank Shanghai Water Company's meter installation contract, it should not think that Mr. Wu Lihua is not clear on this issue. Furthermore, our association reserves the right to make claims on this issue and will not criticize it for the time being. As for contacting your bureau, this is because it is a public utility, and we have to strive for your bureau to understand the facts clearly so that it can exercise the authority of a fair agency. Correspondingly, we are sending this letter, hoping that you will investigate and take note of it.</p>
<h3>The Empress Dowager Grants Mr. Shigemitsu an Artificial Leg and Mr. Nomura an Artificial Eye</h3>

<h3>Wang Qingquan, a Kidnapping Victim, Escapes After a Month</h3>
<p>Shaoxing Bandits Threaten</p>
<p>Shave Beard, Change Clothes, Move to Chongming</p>
<p>Wine and Delicacies, Dead Drunk</p>
<p>Jump Out of Window, Flee to Police Station</p>
<p>Wang Qingquan, a broker at the Shanghai Gauze Exchange, 52 years old, was kidnapped by bandits on January 6th of this year at around 8:00 AM while riding in his private car to the exchange. The incident occurred near Wang Xinyi Ham outside Xiaonanmen. For several months, there has been no news, and rumors outside said that the bandits had already killed him. Now, after inquiries from various sources, it is learned that Wang is still alive and has escaped. After Wang was kidnapped by the bandits, he was imprisoned in a remote bandit lair in a certain village. His beard was forcibly shaved off by the bandits, and his clothes were changed to avoid attention. Later, with the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the bandits transferred him to a sailboat and sailed to a sandbar about two miles east of the Chongming Siji. The surveillance was quite strict, and a small boat came every day to deliver news. All the bandits were from Shaoxing, and they often threatened Wang. Because Wang was old and sick, he had long disregarded life and death, so he closed his eyes and did not answer. Because the bandits had been there for a long time and observed that Wang was old and weak, the surveillance became slightly lax. The other day, the bandits suddenly bought fine wine and delicacies, and they ate and drank heavily. Before long, they were dead drunk. Wang saw such a good opportunity and jumped out of the window without waiting. He set foot on the sand and ran a mile away. He met a villager on the way, who directed him to the Chongming County Fourth District Public Office, where he reported the situation. The District Chief, Xu Dechang, immediately ordered the police to rush to arrest the bandits, but the bandits had already fled, so they were not found. Because Wang had been in the bandit's lair for too long and his nerves were stimulated, resulting in erratic behavior, he was sent to the Third Hospital in the area for recuperation. At the same time, his family was notified to come and claim him.</p>
<h3>A Disturbance Over a Dressmaker's Dress</h3>
<p>Li Huizhen Eager to Try on New Clothes</p>
<p>Chen Fushan Invited to "Have Tea" and Explain</p>
<p>Li Huizhen, a woman from Suzhou, in her early twenties, works as a dancer. She lives at No. 25 Yongnian Lane, Baker Road. On the 20th of this month, the Saint Anna Dance Hall, newly opened on the site of the old Paris Dance Hall opposite the Zhaofeng Garden in West Shanghai, Li began working there as a dancer. Because she was new, her clothing had to be beautiful and fashionable. Therefore, on the 20th, she specially selected white serge fabric and brought it to the Xieshun Chinese and Western Clothing Store opened by Chen Fushan at No. 4 Cian Lane, Tianjin Road, instructing him to make a Western-style short coat with black edges. Because she was eager to wear it, she needed to pick it up the next day. Chen replied that it would take a week to make, but if it was for temporary wear, she could pick it up the next day. Therefore, he rushed to finish it overnight. When she sent someone to pick up the short coat on the 21st, she returned it on the 22nd, saying that the style was not good and asked him to quickly modify it. After the modification, she was still not satisfied. At that time, there was a verbal conflict, and they immediately started fighting. The shop owner, Chen Fushan's finger was bitten by Li, and the counter was overturned. The beaded bracelet on Li's arm also fell to the ground and broke, and two small beads were lost. Later, the Chinese police arrived and took both parties to the police station. The chief thought it was a trivial matter and did not handle it, and warned both parties not to argue again in the future. But on the morning of the day before yesterday, a Ningbo man, Zhang Chunhe, suddenly came to Chen Fushan's place and invited Chen to have tea at the Leyuan Tea House on Jiujiang Road to reason. Chen, fearing something unexpected, secretly reported to the Laozha Police Station, who sent detectives Li Xiushan and Sun Dafa to pretend to be tea customers and wait. Chen, accompanied by his relative Zhu Yinbo, went to the tea house. There, he saw that Li Huizhen had already arrived with Zhang Chunhe, Pan Defa, Ye Xiangshun, and Ding Zhaojin, sitting at the same table. Zhang stepped forward and started to negotiate with Chen, and the others echoed, creating a menacing atmosphere, saying that if he didn't cooperate, there would be trouble. As a result, they agreed on 30 yuan. Chen paid 15 yuan first, and the remaining half was sent to No. 159 Hankou Road according to Zhang's note. At that time, the detectives immediately stepped forward and arrested Li Huizhen and the other five people, and took the cash to the police station, where they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District. According to the police lawyer Ru Baoyi, he prosecuted the defendants for extortion under Article 370 of the Criminal Law and detailed the case, requesting severe punishment for the second defendant, Zhang Chunhe, because Zhang was the leader of the case and took advantage of people's disputes to carry out his extortion and profit from it. The victim, Chen Fushan, also borrowed Zhu Yinbo's testimony to the court, explaining the situation. When questioned, Li Huizhen confessed that Chen had made the clothes badly and had beaten her, breaking the beaded bracelet, so she demanded compensation for the loss. Zhang Chunhe admitted that he was entrusted by Li to demand 18 yuan from Chen for the cost of the fabric and 12 yuan for the two beads. The other three, Pan Defa, etc., all denied their involvement. They hired four lawyers, Fan Gang, Yang Linzhi, etc., to defend them. After the court president Qian Hongye verified the confessions, he sentenced all the defendants to joint extortion. Zhang Chunhe was sentenced to six months of imprisonment and a fine of 30 yuan. Li Huizhen, Pan Defa, Ye Xiangshun, and Ding Zhaojin were each fined 30 yuan. Li Huizhen's sentence was suspended for three years.</p>
<h3>Northern Shanghai Gambling Dens Under Japanese Protection</h3>
<p>Report from the Anti-Opium Association</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Association issued a report yesterday on the investigation of the opening of opium in Northern Shanghai, stating that after the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, after the Japanese army occupied the area near the concession, the Northern Shanghai Local Maintenance Association was established by Japanese-instigated Chinese traitors in the area around Tiantong Road, Wuhua Road, and Linping Road near Dithmarschen Road in Hongkou. All political power fell into the hands of the Japanese. In the past month, within a two-square-mile radius of this area, opium dens and gambling houses have been set up one after another under the protection of the Japanese. City signs are widely posted, and business is open. Once you enter the area, it is like being in a foreign country. Initially, it was tentatively agreed to collect a fee of 300 yuan per day. In the past three weeks, business has been booming, and the total donation from gambling houses has increased to 1,200 yuan per day. There are about 500 opium pipes, and each pipe is taxed two jiao per day, totaling about 100 yuan per day. All of this is collected daily by the Maintenance Association and handed over to the Japanese. Such a huge sum is truly shocking to hear. The license numbers and addresses of each gambling house and opium den are listed below: Shunli Company, No. 4 Jishan Lane, Tiantong Road; Jiufu Company Clubhouse, No. 2 Lane, Shande Lane, Tiantong Road; Defa Company, No. 9 Jishan Lane, Tiantong Road; Dafa Company Flower Association Reception Office, at the back door of the same address; Hongli Clubhouse, Nos. 38-40 Renxin Lane, Hongzhen; Hongjin Clubhouse, Nos. 50-52 Lizhong Lane, Hongzhen; Fuli Company Clubhouse, Sande Lane, Wuhua Road; Fuli Branch, No. 107 Derun Road; Fuli Company, No. 146 Linping Road; Shengli Company, No. 4 Shangde Lane, Shengji Road; Qiaji Company, No. 156 Linping Road; Hongchanghao, No. 19 Tiande Lane, Wuhua Road; Xiechengchang, No. 88 Derun Road; Woyunxuan, No. 4 Yiyi Lane, Tiantong Road; Anlegong, No. 9 Jishan Lane, Tiantong Road; Heli Company, No. 118 Tiantong Road, upstairs of Yongyuxiang Metal Shop; Sanxingshe, No. 66 Derun Road, upstairs of Zhu Mingyang's Lecture Hall; Rongjishe, No. 90 Linping Road; Xinxin Branch, No. 99 Derun Road; Xiaoyao Xuan, No. 3 Wuhua Lane, Wuhua Road; Sanxing Company, No. 2 Lane, Xinhua Lane, Tianbao Road; Zhongxingshe, No. 99 Tiandou Road; Tiansheshe, No. 142 Linping Road; Risheshe, No. 148 Linping Road; Jiushun Company, inside Qingshan Lane, Wuhua Road. The larger opium and gambling companies, such as Jiufu, Shunli, and Fuli, have brightly lit doors, are full of customers, and have plenty of staff and attentive service. Red strips with the words "Welcome to Visit" are posted outside. Other places either sell "Su cigarettes" or red tonic pills (i.e., red pills). The quiet streets of the past have suddenly become bustling scenes. The related social situations have undergone the following changes: (1) Good households are moving away because they cannot bear the filth; (2) Tea houses, dim sum shops, and soda stalls are increasing; (3) Rent is four times higher than before; (4) Cars and rickshaws with opium smokers have increased twentyfold; (5) Waiters are all over the streets, like...It is said that on the 24th, two gambling customers were shot and killed by the Hongli and Shunli companies for robbing gambling customers of over 700 yuan in profits. The Japanese arrested the accounting staff of the two companies, causing a great disturbance.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Shanghai Riye Bank Case</h3>
<p>Registered Creditors Quickly Pay Litigation Fees</p>
<p>The case of Shanghai Riye Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department's creditors suing for the recovery of deposits has been diligently pursued by the volunteer lawyers designated by the municipal government, Wu Jingtai, Jiang Yiping, Qin Liankui, and Chen Tingrui, according to law. The part of the case concerning the appeal of Yie Shantao and others to exempt shareholders and directors from liability, the Jiangsu High Court Third Branch ordered the payment of litigation fees, which has been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that a considerable number of creditors have already paid the fees, and the four lawyers have prepared a list and submitted it to the court. At that time, the four lawyers feared that the failure of creditors to pay the litigation fees would affect their future rights, so they filed a petition to extend the deadline again. It has now been ruled that the extension is granted until June 5th. It is said that the four lawyers are preparing to continue to collect litigation fees, but because the procedure for compiling the list is quite cumbersome, they have to advance the deadline by two days before the court's deadline. Therefore, all creditors who have not paid the litigation fees can bring their deposit books and pay the litigation fees to the four lawyers at 1% of the total amount of the claim before June 3rd to facilitate the proceedings.</p>
<h3>Jiang Rongzhen Killed by Tram</h3>
<p>A certain tram on Route 1 of the Huashang Tram Company was traveling north from Gaochang Temple the other day. When it passed the Shanghai Military Camp, Jiang Rongzhen, a Xinghua native (68 years old) living at No. 8 Dongranfang Lane, was crossing the road. He was unable to avoid the tram in time and was knocked to the ground, injuring his waist. He fainted from the pain. Wu Shutang, the watchman of the 22nd post in the area, heard about it and rushed to send the injured person to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. He also took the No. 16 driver, Meng Qingyuan from Tianjin, to the first precinct in charge. Later, because Jiang's injuries were too severe and the treatment was ineffective, he died in the hospital. After receiving the report, the director, considering that the matter involved human life, ordered a document to be prepared and sent to the Shanghai District Court for investigation.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Announces Regulations for Guest Students in Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday ordered the city's municipal and private secondary schools, saying: "After investigating the city since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, schools in Zhabei and Jiangwan have been unable to start school as scheduled or have temporarily suspended operations due to the war. As a result, many students have transferred to other places or are guest students in other schools. Various secondary schools in the city have therefore recruited guest students, and there are occasional cases of arbitrary enrollment without any investigation, which can easily lead to abuses.

<h3>Record of Striking the Bell at the Ancient Temple (6): The Unswept Courtyard and the Studious Husband</h3>
<p>In the middle of the night, a violent and urgent knocking on the door jolted me awake. This was followed by the sounds of commotion, cold laughter, and shouts of fighting from the village. I put on my clothes, opened the door, and saw that it was none other than the monk's godson, A-Yang. He was out of breath from running, and told me, in a panic, "Father has been tied up. Please go and plead for him."</p>
<p>I hurriedly locked the temple gate and followed A-Yang, running towards the village to save the monk. Several torches were lit in front of A-Yang's house. As I approached the gate, I heard people shouting, "Take them to the city! ...That would be a sight to see! ...Zhong'er is here! Good, Zhong'er! Go in and see what your great monk has been up to." Two stark naked people were tied together in a heap! One was A-Yang's wet nurse, and the other was the monk. A rural scene of catching adulterers was unfolding before my eyes.</p>
<p>When the monk saw me, he said, "Good Zhong'er! Please, beg them to release me." I took off my short coat and covered them, saying, "I am willing to plead on your behalf." Could I refuse the monk's request? No, absolutely not. I said to the villagers, "Let them stay here for a moment, and we'll go to the teahouse to talk."</p>
<p>"Talk, and see if there is any solution," suggested the blacksmith, Old Li. He suggested sending two people to stand guard here. Everyone agreed, and we went to the teahouse to begin negotiations.</p>
<p>I asked, "What do you plan to do?"</p>
<p>Everyone said, "Send them to the county!"</p>
<p>I asked, "Was the monk's action rape?"</p>
<p>Everyone said, "They've been an old couple for years! Don't you know how much they love each other!"</p>
<p>I asked, "Does A-Yang's mother have a husband? How old is she this year?"</p>
<p>The blacksmith, Old Li, said, "A-Yang's mother is a pitiful woman. She lost her husband at twenty-two, and is now twenty-five years old."</p>
<p>I said, "Lawyer Zhao Gongping once came to the temple to visit. I asked him many legal questions, and he said that if an unmarried man and an unmarried woman over twenty years old are willing to be together, it is not against the law. In that case, even if you send the monk to the county, the county will certainly not be able to convict him. In the end, you will only waste your energy and money."</p>
<p>The carpenter, Old Wu, said, "Who wants to meddle in such affairs? This is all caused by someone being jealous!"</p>
<p>I said, "We must always think ahead and consider the consequences before we act. We cannot act rashly."</p>
<p>Everyone said, "In your opinion, what should be done about this matter?"</p>
<p>I said, "According to Buddhist rules, if you are a monk, you are not allowed to marry. If you want to marry, you cannot be a monk. Since he wants a wife, he should no longer be a monk. We can start a school in the temple so that all the children in the village can attend. If he is willing, we can allocate ten acres of land to the couple, only for their own cultivation and consumption, not to be mortgaged or sold to others. In the future, they can become self-sufficient people in the village. If everyone agrees, I will go and talk to him."</p>
<p>Everyone deliberated for some time, and in the end, except for the jealous bricklayer, Old Xu, everyone agreed that my plan was a win-win situation.</p>
<p>The monk was more than willing. Old Li untied their ropes, and this romantic affair was resolved. Later, after he officially married A-Yang's mother, I went to his wedding feast. He thanked me especially and invited me to sit in the seat of honor.</p>
<p>An enemy turned into a friend, an ancient temple became a school—all of this happened in a matter of hours. How incredible!</p>
<h3>Shanghai Education After January 28th (11): Still</h3>
<p>Seventeen. Make-up Lessons During the Holidays</p>
<p>Originally, middle schools should have started classes on February 4th, and elementary schools on February 3rd. Summer vacation was to begin on June 29th for middle schools and July 1st for elementary schools. The school calendar stipulated that the first semester would have 142 days of classes for middle schools and 145 days for elementary schools. This was according to the regulations for the 20th year, and it should not be changed arbitrarily. In the past, when schools took unauthorized holidays or teachers missed classes, it was considered a national crisis. However, this spring in Shanghai, the situation was pressing. It was fortunate enough that schools could barely open, a truly auspicious and congratulatory event. Nevertheless, the missed classes should be made up in order to fulfill the responsibility of nurturing people and saving the nation. Therefore, the Municipal Education Bureau drafted a "Measures for Reducing Holidays and Making Up Classes in Primary and Secondary Schools This Semester," ordering all schools to comply and submit their opening dates and make-up schedules for review. The measures for emphasizing education and making up classes during the holidays are listed for reference below:</p>
<p>1. Schools that started classes before February 15th must follow the school calendar for the summer vacation.</p>
<p>2. Schools that started classes after February 15th but before February 29th should shorten the summer vacation by two weeks according to the school calendar.</p>
<p>3. Schools that started classes after February 29th but before March 15th should shorten the summer vacation by three weeks according to the school calendar.</p>
<p>4. Schools that started classes after March 15th but before March 31st should teach until the end of the semester.</p>

<p>5. Schools that start classes in April will not have a summer vacation, but graduating students must finish early.</p>
<p>6. Spring break for this semester is completely canceled.</p>
<p>7. If schools suspend classes after opening, they should make up for them during holidays.</p>
<p>8. All schools should report their opening and holiday dates, as well as any suspensions and make-up plans, to this bureau for record.</p>
<p>The reporter made a rough calculation: almost no schools need to make up classes completely, but a very few do; those that need to make up classes for the entire summer vacation account for 5%; those that postpone the summer vacation by two weeks account for 58%; and those that make up classes for half of the summer vacation account for about 36%. It seems that when the sun is scorching and the weather is hot and humid, schools in Shanghai will have to work like farmers in the fields.</p>
<p>On the 19th, the second research meeting will be held at the High School Department of Shanghai Provincial Shanghai Middle School, Lujiabang, Xiaonanmen, Shanghai, to discuss "Teaching Methods for Elementary School Work Subjects" and "Guidance Issues." You are requested to send a representative to the meeting and to submit proposals to Mr. Lu Shaoji, Normal Department of Shanghai Middle School, before June 10th for advance preparation. Thank you very much.</p>
<h3>Tea Party at the China Vocational School</h3>
<p>Zhang Danru, a surveying and mapping teacher in the second year of the Advanced Civil Engineering Department of the China Vocational School, was originally the director of the Zhabei Office of the Public Works Bureau.

<h3>Maolai Breaks Our Country's Javelin Record</h3>
<p>The Outstanding Feature of the U.S. Soldier McKinley's Track and Field Performance</p>
<p>Is That They Are All Close to Our Country's Highest Records</p>
<p>The Six Giants Sports Meet will be held at the beginning of next month. In order to examine the results, McKinley, a U.S. soldier stationed in Shanghai, held a joint sports meet for various battalions at the Zhonghua Track and Field Field at 9 a.m. on the 24th. The Third Battalion continued to hold the championship, scoring 64 points. The runner-up was the First Battalion with 56 points, and the Headquarters finished last with 18 points. Now, let's look at the following results:</p>
<h3>Schwank Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>Schwank of the Third Battalion not only had outstanding results, but also won the individual championship, winning three first places and breaking two records, for a total of 15 points. The second individual was "Little Treasure" Sutton, a famous middle-distance runner, who won first place in both the 1600 meters and 800 meters. The famous short-distance runner Tang Sly, who is well-known on the sea, was defeated by Alate in the 200 meters, and tied with Digge for third individual.</p>
<h3>China's Javelin Record</h3>
<p>Officer Maolai, short and stout, with extraordinary coordination, was already well-known in the Shanghai track and field scene last year. In this javelin competition, Maolai suddenly created an amazing performance, with a score of 156 feet 2 inches. The score of the second place, Fileno, also reached 150 feet 9 inches. Not only is it a new Shanghai record, but also a new national record for our country. The highest record in our country was created by Wen Dingxin with 45.90 meters, which is only 150 feet 6 feet 6 inches in English feet.</p>
<h3>Two Heroes Compete in the Sprinting World</h3>
<p>Shi Tanglai, who has been famous for a long time, swept all the first places from 100 meters to 400 meters in the International Sports Meet in Shanghai last year. However, this time, he was defeated by Roger-style football star Alate in the 200 meters. Ah's score was 24.2 seconds. The 100-meter race was still won by Shi. Alate started extremely fast, obviously faster than Shi, but Alate looked back at others while running, which reduced his speed and allowed Shi Tanglai to win the championship with a time of 11.4 seconds.</p>
<h3>Schwank's Three Masterpieces</h3>
<p>Schwank is also famous in the track and field world. On this day, he won the first place in the pole vault, long jump, and triple jump. The pole vault also set a new Shanghai record with a score of 11 feet 1 inch, breaking his own previous best score of 11 feet and a quarter of an inch. Although it is still not as good as Fu Baolu's 11 feet 7 inches (3.54 meters) in our country, it is feared that our country's athletes will hardly be able to reach it at present. Also, Shi's long jump was 19 feet 8 inches, and the triple jump was 39 feet 5 inches.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of Discus and Shot Put</h3>
<p>In addition, Beck's 16-pound shot put, with a score of 42 feet 9 inches, is also not as good as the highest record in our country. Digge's discus was 111 feet 7 inches, which is very close to Zhang Lingjia's 34.63 meters (113 feet 7 feet) in our country and the 35.40 meters used by Lian Zeng last year (116 feet 7 inches).</p>
<h3>The Rest of the Results Are Average</h3>
<p>The high and low are all average, and there is not much to introduce. Brown's 400 meters was 55.2 seconds, and Grove's high jump was 5 feet 2 inches 4 points and 3, Sutton's 800 meters was 2 minutes 12.2 seconds, which is not weak. Also, Sutton's 1600 meters was 5 minutes 7 sand 8.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Athletes Should Also Be Careful</h3>
<p>In the Six Giants Sports Meet to be held on the 4th of next month, McKinley will hold his highest authority. Although the Zhongqing side has already recruited the best players in Shanghai, it is still feared that it is not optimistic. In the jumping department, except for the pole vault, our country can have hope. The first place in the throwing department is feared not to be ours. The situation in the track events is equal. In short, McKinley is a strong enemy of Zhongqing, and we must be prepared to defend against him.</p>

<h3>The Old Noodle Shop Owner's Record of Sharpening His Sword</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>The old noodle shop owner's surname is unknown. Let us call him by this name for now. The old man has been running his shop in Goubangzi for more than ten years. He is as industrious as the one in Jinzhou and is full of vigor. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese bandits took over and their iron hooves ravaged the Liaoning Province. Only Jinzhou was still in our hands. However, the Japanese army coveted it very much and would not allow our Northeast Army to have a foothold there. Therefore, they transferred troops westward. The Japanese were eager to try. Goubangzi happened to be in the path of their advance. The people fled to the interior of the Guanzhong area. The old man gave all his assets to his son and daughter-in-law, urging them to leave quickly. But he remained alone. His son and daughter-in-law pleaded with him strongly, but could not persuade him. They left with tears in their eyes. The old man was not afraid at all and opened his shop as usual. He said to people in between, "The Japanese bandits are like greedy snakes, recommended to eat our country. Those who guard the land cannot fulfill their responsibilities. They are eager for internal wars and cowardly in resisting foreign enemies. They are lending weapons to the enemy and providing food to the thieves. They are sitting idly by and watching the enemy's cavalry invade the west without being able to resist. This is abandoning the people of our Eastern Province to the mouths of tigers and wolves. What could be more heartbreaking than this? I am old. When the country is in trouble, why should I avoid it? If the Japanese bandits come, I will find a way to harm them." Before long, the proposal for a neutral zone in Jinzhou failed. The Japanese army entered from Changfu as expected. Goubangzi fell in no time. After the Japanese army arrived, the old man opened his shop as usual, and even smoked his pipe, remaining exceptionally calm. Four or five Japanese soldiers entered his shop. Seeing him, they laughed and said, "This old man is much bolder than the young ones. Are you willing to be a docile subject of our great Japan? We will protect you and not kill you." The old man said yes, yes. The Japanese soldiers first ordered the old man to taste the noodles he made. The old man immediately put down his pipe and began to make noodles. He served them in a large bowl and presented them to the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese soldiers first ordered the old man to taste them to test if they were poisoned. The old man calmly finished a bowl first. He said to the Japanese soldiers, "Why are you so timid? Who would poison people?" The Japanese soldiers laughed and then ate with peace of mind. But in less than an hour, the poison took effect. They cried out in pain and fell to the ground one after another. The old man also suffered severe pain and could not hold on. He collapsed in the shop. It turned out that the old man had put a lot of arsenic in the noodles when he made them, hoping to poison the Japanese soldiers to death. The reason why he willingly tasted them first was that he had already resolved to die. If he did not do so, it would not be enough to make the cunning Japanese soldiers die with him. Mr. Zhu Aoyun served in Huangguantun. He fled to Shanghai from Ping after the looting. He recounted this matter to me. The sage said, "The brave are fearless." Such an old man is probably in the stream of the brave. He is worthy to be compared with the young French girl in Mei Village, who designed to deceive the enemy. This echoes across ancient and modern times.</p>
<h3>A Wounded Soldier in the 19th Army</h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>The Japanese army has retreated. The day before yesterday, I went to my hometown of Nanxiang alone and saw many compatriots who had suffered. They were supporting the old and carrying the young, with bitter smiles on their faces, returning to their long-separated homes one after another. The trenches along the way were still facing each other. At noon, I finally entered the town. The scene of desolation was touching and made people shed tears. Upon arriving home, a gatekeeper named Abiao recounted an inhumane act committed by a Japanese soldier. Therefore, I record it below.</p>
<p>When the loyal and brave 19th Route Army swiftly retreated to the second line of defense, a rear hospital inside a certain ancestral hall had to be moved to Kunsu in a very short time. Therefore, the wounded soldiers were hurriedly carried away. But it was at night, and one soldier was lying in the rice straw and was not transported away in time. When he woke up the next morning, the Japanese army had already arrived. Upon seeing the wounded soldier, they immediately tied his hands behind his back with iron wire, causing the flesh to break and bleed. They then wrapped a long iron wire around his neck and hung him under a stone archway. Two Japanese soldiers stood to the left and right, pushing him back and forth, hitting the stone pillars of the archway. Our loyal and brave wounded soldier, speaking in Cantonese, scolded them, "You are uneducated. You are truly barbarians. I am already injured. You should not insult me like this." His voice was strong and contained no sounds of crying or begging for mercy. The two Japanese soldiers became even more angry and stabbed him more than ten times. Blood gushed out from the wounded soldier, but he still did not shout in pain. Instead, he shouted loudly, "Long live the Republic of China!" At that time, Abiao was hiding behind a tree on the opposite bank of a small river, watching from afar, but was unable to help. He only saw the withered yellow leaves under the wounded soldier stained red. The two Japanese soldiers laughed and spoke, using their rifle butts to beat him for about half an hour. Later, he heard the cries gradually weakening, sobbing more than ten times, and suddenly shouting "Long live the Republic of China!" before he died. Alas, how heroic! This wounded soldier is a pity that very few know about. Therefore, I record it to tell the people of the country.</p>
<h3>The Philosophy of Love</h3>
<p>— Hong Honglie</p>
<p>What exactly is love? It is simply an abstract term that encompasses the combined physical and spiritual interactions between human males and females, resulting in mutual affection.</p>
<p>To answer this question, we must study the human desire to survive and the fundamental question of what makes a person human. We know that a person is composed of both spirit and flesh, and that there is a distinction between males and females. It is through the union of males and females that humanity as a whole is formed, and that humanity can collectively organize a society of survival in the world. The greatest elements of survival are mostly two kinds: one is material needs, and the other is spiritual needs. The former belongs to carnal desires, which are the physical needs of the five senses, four limbs, and sexual organs. The latter belongs to spiritual desires, which are the mental comforts of sight, sound, smell, taste, and music. To go a step further, the former is natural, substantial, and easily seen, while the latter is hidden, imaginary, suggestive, and artistic.</p>
<p>These two elements have an inseparable and close relationship with life. Humans need them to harmonize his and her lives with each other, and the so-called "sexual" issue is between the flesh and the spirit.</p>
<p>From the perspectives of physiology, psychology, and aesthetics, men and women each possess different natural physical beauty endowed by nature. Artists study the beauty of the human body, with landscapes of high mountains, small hills, forests, and secluded valleys, and scenery of sunset, dawn, white snow, and flowers. In men, there is the magnificence of strength and majesty; in women, there are the gentleness of winding curves, the beauty of melodious and clear music, and the charm of intoxicating and soul-stirring fragrances. Therefore, men and women each have a soul that is naturally drawn to the other, and so they love and pursue each other, until the physical contact satisfies the pleasure of the spirit.</p>
<p>Because the Creator wants to prolong or continue the existence of humanity, there is the union of the two sexes, male and female. This kind of union is not limited to knowledge and learning, but is achievable by all things in the world—birds, fish, beasts, insects, and even grass, trees, and rocks. This is the most meaningful fundamental issue of human and all living things' survival. By understanding this fundamental principle, the issue of love can be easily solved.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>"Looking at the clear sky with both eyes" was originally the sad and bored tone of the disappointed. Unexpectedly, our Chinese people are now completely immersed in a sad and bored situation. Opening our eyes, we cannot see the clear sky. The so-called "blue sky, white sun, and a field of red" is simply a dark and sunless land filled with blood and tears, or perhaps a pitch-black mess! The three eastern provinces were lost, and humiliating national treaties were signed. Facing the current national crisis, there are no thorough countermeasures, and internal divisions are becoming more and more precarious. The infighting of warlords and politicians, the unlimited plunder by corrupt officials, the internal strife of the Guangdong land and sea forces, the spread of banditry in various provinces, and the public sale of opium—these are not foreign invasions, but self-inflicted signs of destruction. The people's lives and the nation's lifeline are faltering, but who can save the people from fire and water, and dispel the clouds and see the clear sky?</p>
<h3>Record of the Prosperity and Decline of Two Trees</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>In Jixian Nunnery near Datong Bridge in Wapu, there are two ancient ginkgo trees, each several dozen spans around. They are relics of thousands of years. One summer, there was a great wind and rain, and an ancient ginkgo tree broke off a branch, almost the size of a hug, and several feet long. But looking up at it, it only removed some of the immature branches, slightly revealing the light of the sky. Fifty miles away, in the kitchen of a certain surname in Nanxiang, there was something rising about a foot high, which could be rested on. Some say that it is the obliquely emerging root of the ancient ginkgo tree. It can be seen how large this tree is. Last year, a certain person came to the nunnery to rest. He then took out a cigarette and lit it with the remaining incense embers from the front of the Buddha shrine. He threw the incense ashes into the crevices of the ancient ginkgo tree. The tree had cracked after many years, and could hold objects. Unexpectedly, the wind blew fallen leaves, which accumulated in the crevices. Moreover, the weather was dry and arid. The fire from the burning incense ignited the leaves. The flames spread like the tongues of spirits, reaching between the trunk moss and branches. Although villagers poured water to extinguish it, a patch of it was charred black, and it no longer had its former lush and verdant appearance. Everyone thought that it was withering, and were not very sorry. Unexpectedly, this spring, the tree suddenly sprouted new branches in anger. The dense leaves covered the sun. Japanese soldiers came to invade. The villages and farmlands were all shrouded in flames, but the ancient ginkgo tree was still preserved unharmed, as if protected by spirits. This is also strange. A person who had fled from Kunshan to avoid the disaster told me this.</p>
<p>When Zhang Jian of Nantong was alive, he had a Hao Nan Villa as his residence. The villa was full of beautiful trees, flowers, bamboo, and stones. Zhang loved pine trees. So, he moved a white pine from another place and transplanted it into the villa. He left a square zhang (unit of measurement) of old soil around the roots of the pine tree, fearing that the roots and the old soil would separate, or easily wither. He surrounded the square zhang of soil with cloth, wrapped it with rope, and supported it with a bamboo-woven basket. He transported it with a light carriage. When turning to go to the villa, he had to pass through a certain street.</p>
<h3>International Debt Default (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Kai Xu</p>
<p>Everyone knows how to default on debt. The skills vary. People who live in Shanghai owe rent, and the landlord wants them to move out. They owe electricity bills, and the company wants to cut the lines. But I have heard that some people owe rent for five or six months, and the landlord does not force them to move out. They owe electricity bills for three or four months, and the company does not cut the lines. We do not investigate the details and do not know how they default on their debts. We think it is brilliant. But if you are willing to humbly ask for advice, they will happily tell you the twists and turns. Then you will suddenly understand and increase your ordinary social knowledge. Individuals have ways to default on debts, and countries also have ways to default on debts. When a person defaults on someone else's debt, it must eventually be resolved by law. As a result, they are pursued for old debts, their reputation is damaged, their credit is lost, and they cannot stand in society. But international debt default only requires getting away with it and being able to say it. The law is ineffective, and treaties are just empty words. If you have military power, you can come and fight. If I can beat you, I will fight you. If I can't beat you, I will slowly think of ways to repay the debt. If I beat you, not only will I not owe you anything, but you will have to repay me double. Because international debts are not necessarily commercial or economic loans. Many are compulsory debts. For example, after the Allied Powers won the Central Powers in the war, all the expenses of the four years of the war were lumped together and Germany was made to pay. At that time, Germany was subservient and had no choice. Saying one was one, and saying two was two. Now it's better. It has gradually risen, and it can also talk eloquently at European conferences, arguing that Germany should not bear the responsibility for the European war alone, and that Germany's domestic situation is extremely difficult and it cannot continue to repay war debts, etc. This kind of debt default is still reasonable. Germany used to be bullied, but now it refuses to continue to be a victim. So it wants to straighten its back and say a few harsh words. Now the method of defaulting on debts is even more strange. The French want to default on debts to the Americans. During the European war, France borrowed money from the United States. The United States treated France as a poor country, and was lenient with interest rates, etc. France used this money to win the war. Not only did it defeat Germany, but it also became the richest country in the world, collecting money from all over the world and depositing it in the French National Bank, causing the world's prices to rise day by day. However, it not only does not want to move its war debts to the United States, but also wants to default on them. Not only does it want to default on them, but it also bites back, saying that the United States owes France money. Not only does it say that the United States owes France money, but it also says that the United States owes money to Italy and other countries. It even wants to unite a group of debtors to make things difficult for the creditor. Do you think this kind of default is not a major international debt default? But how exactly does France default on its debts?</p>
<p>There was a narrow alley that could not be passed through. So, they demolished the houses and rebuilt them after the carriages passed. They valued this grand Fir so much. Since the grand Fir was planted by Shu Zhu, he held a banquet for his guests and asked them to write poems in its honor. So, the grand Fir became famous for a time. All the tourists from all over the world considered it an honor to see the grand Fir. My colleague, Mr. Jiang Xiwei, recently came from Nantong and said that the grand Fir withered and turned yellow on the day after Mr. Yu died. Now it is withered and dead, and there is no trace of any branches or remaining trunks.</p>
<p>Statement: The phrase "this treacherous child" in the last paragraph of "Cai Jiezhi Reads Latin" on the 24th can be omitted, according to Mr. Xiang. Also, the two poems, "Candlelight Swaying Red" etc., were written by Mr. Xie Yucen. I apologize for omitting the name.</p>
<h3>Record of Military Life in Twin Buildings (63)</h3>
<p>— Owner of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Boundless Grief in Repentance, Difficult to Achieve Optimism; Extreme Singing and Dancing for Pleasure, Glimpse of Majesty</p>
<p>Liang Xiaoyun asked with a smile, "How can you be sure that it will be a joke?" An Yutian was so anxious that he could only reach out to wipe the sweat from his forehead and said, "How much ability do I have? Don't you know? Moving some books around to write and fiddle with might be okay. Asking me to recruit bandits, organize militias, and establish a new army is just talking on paper. There's not even a shadow of it. If I could really rally these people, my family wouldn't have been ruined by Niu Heifeng." Liang Xiaoyun clicked her tongue at the side of her cherry lips and said with contempt, "Look how anxious you are. How unpromising. I say, you big bookworm, please be quiet and listen to me explain and enlighten you. Is that okay?" An Yutian answered with a long face, "Okay. Please tell me." Liang Xiaoyun smiled and said, "Don't you know that everyone who is doing errands now is winning the world with empty talk? As long as you can fool Lao Ye into believing you and trick him into writing his name on the commission, you can naturally boast and rally many people. Those bandits and militias, who doesn't have a craving for officialdom? Who doesn't want to dabble in a formal change of name? As long as you spread the word, you won't have to worry about those people coming to you to solicit business. Then you show some discernment and use some tricks to select a few people who really have some power and give them a name that can rally people. Appoint them as chiefs and battalion commanders, and maintain good connections with them so that they are willing to support you and benefit themselves after success. That's like gathering wood to make a forest and gathering fur to make a robe. They will go down one level at a time to find people. Then, when you add them all up to make a whole number, it won't be so difficult. Even if you can't gather a full number at that time, rely on having a small foundation and try to say some nice things to Lao Ye, asking him to allocate some more military equipment and allow you to recruit some new soldiers as supplements. Eventually, you can turn the fake into the real and completely organize the new troops. If you don't first fool him with these dazzling words, and honestly say that you want to start a new stove and establish a new army, or ask him to allocate an existing team to you, firstly, his troops have long become the private property of his senior officers. No one will let you interfere. Of course, he can't allocate them. Secondly, he, as a high-ranking official, is most afraid of trouble. He knows that it takes a lot of money and equipment to establish a team out of thin air. How could he just give you so much money? Then the conversation will be unpleasant. Don't expect him to agree to such a big topic. This will be like you said, you can only do a nominal errand and never climb to a high branch."</p>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market Has Loose Short Covering</h3>
<p>Transaction Volume Remains Sparse</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market showed a slight firmness. After fluctuating for many days, the Sichuan gang made slight purchases. A major factory shipped its own products to various places for sales. The Shanghai spot market declined, and sentiment slightly improved. Loose short covering pushed prices upward. It is said that the Sichuan gang purchased more than 10,000 bales of coarse yarn in Hankou, so a large transaction volume is unlikely to be realized. It is also rumored that Japanese yarn is secretly being pushed aggressively. However, most people expect that there may be developments in various places after the holidays, and buying interest is higher. However, the transaction volume of medium-term yarn in the market is still not high.</p>
<h3>Human Standard Good, 2+.</h3>
<p>The Human Standard market opened with a relatively flat sentiment. As American cotton declined, sentiment softened. Strong purchases were heard in the second and third rounds, with each month rising by 2, 3 qian. The afternoon market tightened again, with even more scattered households buying short. Each month rose by 6, 7 qian to 1 liang. The total transaction volume for the day was 4,600 bales. Checking sales, Jifeng sold 200 bales, Tongfu sold 300 bales, Rongxing sold 300 bales, Senkang sold 350 bales, and Shengtail sold 250 bales. Checking purchases, Changji bought 300 bales, Gengfeng bought 150 bales, Shunda bought 150 bales, Renfeng bought 300 bales, and Changfeng bought 650 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Soft Decline</h3>
<p>The cotton market turned weak. As American cotton declined, gold prices remained flat. Consumption of spot cotton in the market remained sluggish. However, some outsiders thought that the base was too small and the period was still far away. Local cotton inventories in this port are weak, so thoughts of buying are not cut off. Some say that Hankou alone has a stock of 100,000 bales of cotton. According to the reporter's observation, the current situation is still in a state of hesitation. A major change will occur after the American cotton acreage report.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Loosened</h3>

Indian cotton brokers sold off, and the market was stable. Bengal rose by 2 rupees, and White River rose by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 24th):</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea in Jiangyin: Changes in Spring Silkworm Rearing</h3>
<p>Continuous Thunderstorms and Hail... Silkworms and Mulberry Trees Suffer Damage</p>
<p>In the four rural districts of Jiangyin, this year, fewer than half as many farmers are raising silkworms compared to last year. After the silkworm eggs hatched, there were continuous days of rain, sudden cold snaps, and sudden heat waves, causing the silkworms to develop sluggishly. Early silkworms only reached the stage of the first sleep before consuming leaves, while late silkworms only reached the second sleep. Recently, there was a heavy thunderstorm followed by hail, causing the silkworms to mutate and change. They spit out foul water, their bodies turned black, their abdomens ruptured and rotted, and the stench spread rapidly. The mulberry trees also suffered damage, with the price of leaves rising to eight to ten yuan per picul.</p>
<h3>Listless Silk Market in Foreign Concessions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in the foreign concessions remained listless. Although reports were received from New York and Lyon via telegram, the prices offered were still low. Considering the cost of the factories and the loan requirements, each bale still incurred a loss of over two hundred taels. There were no transactions reported. Soon, new silk will be on the market. If the price of silk in Europe and America does not rise, the prospects for the silk market are viewed with increasing pessimism.</p>
<h3>Hongcha from the River Port Opens for Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market in the foreign concessions, the Hongcha from the River Port [Hekou] of Jiangxi Province was opened for trading by Jardine Matheson at a price of fifty-five taels, which is twenty-five taels lower than last year. Due to a loosening of market conditions and a continued decline in the price of silver, the various firms trading in Hongcha from Qimen and Fuliang were showing strong interest. Total transactions for the city reached over two thousand three hundred taels, with prices ranging from ninety to one hundred and sixty-five taels, which is twenty chests lower than before. As for the green tea market, needle-shaped [Zhen] and eyebrow-shaped [Xiu Mei] teas are selling well, while precious eyebrow [Zhen Mei] teas have become sluggish. No further offerings have been seen from the Tunxi region or from the plucked bud [chouxin] variety.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market: Scarce and Selling Well</h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, few ships arrived from the interior, and the stocks at the docks were not abundant. Trading in the street became increasingly active. The price of fresh Northern Japonica rice and Zhongguan rice rose by one or two jiao compared to before. There was a shortage of thin paddy rice, and the opening price was fixed. There was a scarcity of superior reed paddy rice [Lu Yang Jian Huo], and the price remained unchanged. Early rice, white rice, and Flying Phoenix rice were sold as soon as they arrived, and the price rose by a few jiao. Tongbian Yin Yuan wine dealers continued to handle nearly a thousand piculs, with the opening price fluctuating by one or two jiao. Due to flooding on the Yangtze River, foreign rice was still being shipped to customers, and the market rebounded.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: The weather cleared up, and the sources from various groups were from the Nianliuqihao [perhaps a location]. Because the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, the shops were unwilling to add more stock, and the prices of various goods gradually rose. There was a limited supply of Qingjiao Fenglian thin paddy rice, and the price was firm by a few jiao. Changshu Northern Japonica rice also rose by two jiao. Foreign reed paddy rice was sold at a stable price, and the market was also stimulated. Manufacturers downstream had approximately three thousand piculs of tax grain [Hujiao].</p>
<h3>Small Polished Rice Sells Vigorously, Price Rises by Two Jiao</h3>
<p>Other Varieties of Rice Followed Suit, Rising by a Few Jiao</p>
<p>Strong Demand from Local and Inland Traders</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for foreign rice saw strong demand from both local and inland traders. There were inquiries about rice stockpiled in Chongming, Jiangbei, and rural villages. The stocks of small polished rice were being depleted quickly, and the price jumped by over two jiao. Medium and inferior grades of sieved polished rice and other rice varieties all followed suit, rising by a few jiao. This was mainly due to the rising price of Siamese rice and the strong demand for foreign rice from local and inland traders, as well as inquiries from stockpilers. People were optimistic about the market. Total sales of small polished rice opened at over twenty thousand bags, with high-quality rice priced at eleven yuan, and regular rice priced at ten yuan and nine and a half jiao to ten yuan and six and a half jiao. Three hundred bags of aged small polished rice were priced at ten yuan and four jiao and two fen. Three thousand bags of red small polished rice were priced at ten yuan. Five hundred bags of aged small polished coarse rice were priced at nine yuan and five and a half jiao. One thousand five hundred bags of Malaysian rice were priced at ten yuan and eight jiao. Five hundred bags of Saigon Number One rice were priced at eleven yuan and seven and a half jiao to eleven yuan and six jiao. One thousand bags of Min Dang rice for delivery in three days were priced at eleven yuan and three jiao. Another two to three weeks' delivery of two hundred tons, Saigon rice for July delivery one thousand tons, the price is the same as last time.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Experience Slight Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Merchants' Association's market was still active, but trading was unremarkable. The transaction price for Dutch Number 24 raw sugar and white sugar was thirteen taels and five qian, with few transactions. The market remained stable. Finely ground white sugar was thirteen taels and six qian, and Hong Kong raw sugar and white sugar was thirteen taels and four qian. Transactions were scarce, and the trend was unremarkable. Taikoo refined CW mark was fifteen taels and nine qian and a half, HM mark was fourteen taels, and H mark was twelve taels and two qian. Transactions were scarce, but the market sentiment remained firm.</p>
<h3>Metals: Lead Market Stirs After Long Calm</h3>
<p>The lead market has been sluggish since the tea merchants stopped trading. The standards were poor, and the price was declining. The lowest price for Huazu lead was thirteen taels and five qian, Hunan lead was thirteen taels, and triangular lead was twelve taels and seven and a half qian. In recent days, business from military factories and merchants has been vigorous, so trading on the market has been more lively. Although the asking price has not increased, the firmness of the market is unlike the past. Yesterday, over three hundred dan were offered, and the buyers were from the Fujian group and the Nanjing military factory.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: White Lotus Supplies Are Thin</h3>
<p>Land Prices are Rising</p>
<p>Recently, due to thin supplies of white lotus seeds, land prices have been rising steadily. According to reports, the purchase price has reached sixty-two yuan, and there are few goods available, with a continued upward trend. The stock here is also scarce, and merchants from Shantou, Guangdong, also have demand, so sales are exceptionally strong. Yesterday, the market price was forty-eight taels, and the next grade was forty-seven taels. It is possible that the price will reach fifty taels in the future, as the supply cannot meet the demand.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Recent Impeachment Case</h3>
<p>— Guliang</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, impeaching the President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei, yesterday I read a Nanjing dispatch in this newspaper stating: "The Central Supervisory Committee resolved that the case of Yu Youren impeaching Wang Zhaoming should not be discussed further, taking a passive attitude. On the 24th, Yu submitted his resignation to the Central Executive Committee. Wang also felt deeply uneasy and submitted his resignation as well. On the afternoon of the 24th, the Central Standing Committee held a special discussion, and everyone agreed that the Control Yuan is responsible for investigating and impeaching, and that it showed the independent spirit of the Five Yuan by exercising its powers without avoiding suspicion or resentment. The Executive Yuan submitted the armistice agreement after it had been passed by the Central Political Council, which was also in order. It was unanimously decided to sincerely retain both presidents Yu and Wang."</p>
<p>One is seeking to resign because the impeachment was ineffective, and the other is resigning because he feels uneasy! But the Central Standing Committee is using "deeply demonstrated the independent spirit of the Five Yuan" and "also in order" to separately retain them. Who is legal and who is illegal, is not mentioned.</p>
<p>But from "exercising its powers without avoiding suspicion or resentment, deeply demonstrated...!" we can see that the impeachment was correct, and the impeached party should be punished! If we argue from "passed by the Central Political Council, which was also in order," then it seems that the Control Yuan's impeachment was improper and close to slander.</p>
<p>In any case, I believe that one of the two sides is wrong. This concerns the national legislation and cannot be glossed over. Is it "illegal"? Or is it "slanderous impeachment"? The truth should be clarified. If it is buried without resolution, it would be unfair and without principles.</p>

<h3>Banquet for Teacher Tang Weizhi, Two Quatrains</h3>
<p>— Mengtiaoyan Master</p>
<p>Teacher Tang Weizhi came to Shanghai to avoid the war, and had a public banquet with fellow students.</p>
<p>After the war, the virtuous still gather, not many tears are shed at the new pavilion. In front of the wine, a song about the destruction of the homeland, the alligator is angry, the dragon is worried, unbearable to hear.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of feelings enter mournful chants, tribulations are hard to erase, the heart chases the sun. White hair relives the Tianbao dream, a testament written with deep wine stains. (Teacher was robbed on the way to Shanghai but escaped).</p>
<h3>Feeling After Long Overcast Skies in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ding Songzhai</p>
<p>Miserable mist and sorrowful clouds cannot be unlocked, the heart of heaven is silent and full of grief. As if pitying the wronged souls after the war, rain sprinkles like tears of people.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Candle Manufacturing Method (II)</h3>
<p>— Yun Li</p>
<p>(III) Manufacturing Procedures</p>
<p>First, use a soft cloth dampened with a little kerosene to coat the inside and outside of the candle-making machine cylinder once. Then use a clean cloth to wipe dry to remove dust. Then, insert the wick into the mold hole and fix it on the machine. Next, put the prepared raw materials into a pot to melt. After the oil is completely melted, remove the fire under the pot and wait for a moment for the temperature to decrease before pouring it into the mold. Then, run cold water outside the mold to allow the candle to solidify completely. Then, take it out and cut the end of the candle with a knife to make an ordinary candle.</p>
<p>(IV) Candle Coloring Method</p>
<p>First, put a little stearin into a pot and heat it until it melts. Then, grind the required pigment into a fine powder and put it into the stearin to mix and melt. Then, add this mixed pigment to a solution of paraffin and stearin, and stir vigorously to make the color uniform. Then, follow the procedure for making ordinary candles, pour it into the machine cylinder, and you're done.</p>
<p>(V) Candle Packaging Method</p>
<p>After the candles are made, they must be wrapped in paper, with each package containing six or twelve candles. This is determined by the convenience of each manufacturer. The outer layer of the wrapping paper is usually made of blue, hard cardboard, and the inner layer is sandwiched with a white waxed paper.</p>
<p>(VI) Mold Purchase</p>
<p>The best molds for making candles are made of galvanized iron, because galvanized iron does not produce brown rust. Copper molds should not be used, because copper easily produces green rust, which cannot produce clean white candles. The value of the machine depends on the size of the candle being made. Large ones cost about several tens of yuan, while small ones only cost six or seven to ten yuan. The ones sold by Mobil Oil Company are the best.</p>
<p>A Corner of Society</p>
<h3>Lane Education</h3>
<p>— Wuwei</p>
<p>| Miscellaneous Thoughts II |</p>
<p>In Shanghai, where land is at a premium, the courtyard of a house is only as big as a square table, which aptly matches the name "well". The front building, back building, side rooms, and pavilion rooms of a house are inhabited by no fewer than five or six families. To take a breath of fresh air, one has to go to the lane. Especially for playful children, the lane becomes their public entertainment ground.</p>
<p>In every lane, you can encounter more than five kinds of food vendors and more than ten kinds of people, each doing their different work in their own society.</p>
<p>I am fortunate to be born in this metropolis, and even more fortunate to live in the most complex corner of this metropolis 丨 Zhabei. Around me, I am surrounded by the noise of factories and workers. When I am writing, I often stick my head out the window to get some fresh air. Therefore, the activities in the lane often come into my eyes and cause a kind of unwarranted emotion.</p>
<p>The people active in this small world are mostly children from Jiangbei. "'Dahua Evening News! Do you want the Dahua Evening News!' A child is holding a piece of paper and walking around there, imitating the tone of a newspaper seller.</p>
<p>Come on! I'm not afraid of you! Several children are holding bamboo poles and fighting there. The more timid ones are cheering from behind, or scolding. Several more are practicing their skills under the wall, supporting themselves on the ground with both hands, their feet facing the sky, turning their bodies upside down. A smaller one tries to do the same, but his hands slip, and his head hits the cement floor with a thud and he cries. 'Useless fellow! Crying is not a good skill!' The people next door say with contempt. Then another one stands upside down. Another group is rolling coins.</p>
<p>'Dang! Got it, now you owe me five!' the winner says. Another group is now putting on a symbolic cast drama. A child is riding on another child's back, patting and walking, as if riding a horse. At the entrance of the lane, there is a candy vendor using the sound of a lottery stick tube to attract children's money. In addition to getting candy, the children also learn gambling skills. In their small minds, they will cleverly apply it to other things, guessing how many copper coins or beans are held in the hand! They can also bet on who will win. In this small society, they learn as much as possible the lessons given to them by the environment, and they also learn words that are enough to insult the other party and make them angry 丨 this is their education. They live in this environment from morning to night, just waiting, waiting for the old man to send them to the factory.</p>
<p>Alas! Poor factory candidates, this is what I think every time I see them.</p>
<p>The Question of Sex</p>
<p>Transformation</p>
<p>She is an elementary school teacher at my school. The students secretly call her Aunt Wang. Originally, she was extremely quiet, did not like to talk and laugh, and even less liked to powder her face and perm her hair. In particular, she extremely disliked watching movies.</p>
<p>Several days ago, through the introduction of her friend Ms. Ling, she was introduced to a boyfriend, Mr. B. He was a classmate of Ms. Ling's brother and was studying at a certain university. Since the two of them met, her attitude has changed greatly. Her face is painted like a big A Fu doll bought from Wuxi, and she often has two blood-red lips, chatting and laughing with her colleagues. Her former quiet attitude has been invisibly eliminated. Her hair is curly, like the barbed wire fence during martial law. She has really changed, completely changed.</p>
<p>One day, Hui told me that she had seen Aunt Wang watching a movie with B at the Beijing Theater. At first, I didn't believe it. Later, I often heard students say that they met her with B at the Carlton watching a movie, and another day they saw her at the Gan Theater watching a movie with B.</p>
<p>One Sunday afternoon, Hui and Ling came to my house and asked me to go to the French Park to play. At that time, I was sitting at home and really felt bored, and it had been a long time since I had been to the park to play, so I immediately went with them. But things coincided extremely well. The three of us were sitting on a bench under a big tree talking when he and B happened to come side by side. He didn't recognize us, so he still raised his head and puffed out his chest, walking proudly. But she had already seen us. She felt a little embarrassed, lowered her head, turned red, and pretended not to see us, going around another path. This time I finally felt that my trip was worthwhile, seeing a scene of a live love play.</p>
<p>It was such an unexpected turn of events. One day, after finishing night school, we were all reading in the dormitory when Hui ran into the dormitory, jumping and skipping, and said softly; "Hey! Do you know that Aunt Wang has lost her love? Her boyfriend has changed his mind. I heard that he already has another very beautiful girlfriend."</p>
<p>"How would you know? I don't think so," I said to Hui in surprise.</p>
<p>"Who's kidding you, everyone knows it, and someone has already seen B watching a movie with that girl at a certain big theater. Their attitude was very intimate," Hui said boastfully.</p>
<p>"Then does Aunt Wang know?" I couldn't help asking her.</p>
<p>"Of course she knows, that's why she hasn't been to school for two days," Hui said.</p>
<p>"Oh, no wonder, I haven't seen him for two days," Shan said quietly.</p>
<p>"Alas: I really don't know, they were so intimate, how could it come to this," Zhu said.</p>
<p>"These kinds of people are worthy of having received such a high education," I said angrily in silence.</p>
<p>"Oh! A man's heart is really unpredictable," Shan said, shaking her head.</p>
<p>The dinner bell rang in the midst of the chaotic noise, interrupting our conversation.</p>
<p>School Writing</p>
<h3>Mr. and Miss</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Mr. is a pronoun for gentleman, and Miss is a pronoun for young lady. Although these two nouns are borrowed from the English dictionary, they are spoken very naturally in the mouths of Chinese people. If you don't believe me, look at the first sentence that modern young men and fashionable young women say when they meet, it is always Mr. X and Miss X.</p>
<p>The principal of C School is an American student. Because he has been abroad, he has brought back a lot of foreign airs. He usually refers to teachers and students as Mr. or Miss, which is so polite and so equal.</p>
<p>The principal is so polite to the students, so the other teachers certainly don't dare to put on airs and show their dignity. Therefore, every time the roll is called, the names of the male students are added with Mr., and the names of the female students are added with Miss.</p>
<p>One day, a substitute teacher came. He also knew the school spirit of C School, but when he got a roll book, he couldn't tell who was Mr. and who was Miss in a classroom where boys and girls were sitting together. After hesitating for a while, he finally came up with a way.</p>
<p>His method was to look at the names on the roll book and add Mr. to the male names and Miss to the female names. Because most Chinese names can be used to distinguish between men and women at a glance, but even if he guessed some of them correctly, some girls might have male names, and some boys might have female names. A joke therefore occurred.</p>
<p>Boys were added with Miss, and girls were added with Mr. After discovering the mistake once, there was a burst of laughter in the classroom. By the time he finished calling the roll, all the students in the class were laughing so hard that they couldn't catch their breath.</p>
<h3>A Female Student's Leather Satchel</h3>
<p>— Changmu</p>
<p>It was almost noon, twelve o'clock, and everyone's stomachs were rumbling, hoping to be dismissed from class quickly, but the dismissal bell hadn't rung yet. The teacher was standing on the podium, pointing and drawing and talking non-stop.</p>
<p>Clang! The bell only rang once, without waiting for the teacher to say "dismissed," everyone grabbed their books, stood up, and ran outside.</p>
<p>The very narrow classroom door was blocked by many people, surging forward and pushing backward, all wanting to return home as quickly as possible, their hearts like those of criminals being released from prison.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The sound of something falling to the ground. Everyone's gaze focused on the source of the sound. Suddenly, a burst of intoxicating fragrance touched everyone's sense of smell.</p>
<p>A female student bent down and picked up what had fallen on the ground and put it into her small and exquisite leather satchel. In addition to a few textbooks and lecture notes, others discovered that in that female student's leather satchel, there was also a bottle of "Three Flowers Brand Snow Cream," a box of "Kou Dan," and a tube of "Kiss Proof." Unfortunately, a bottle of Cappl perfume had already been broken on the ground.</p>
<p>This is a question, what did that female student bring those things to school for? Could it be that there is a "beauty practice" subject in the school?</p>

<h3>Chain Education Yunguang</h3>
<p>One Saturday at noon, Mr. Sun was supposed to accompany his wife to the movies as usual. But because yesterday in the writing room, his colleague Lao Wang talked about how fun roulette was, which Mr. Sun listened to with great interest, so he was moved. He and Lao Wang agreed to go to the roulette gambling place to play together today, so he had to take leave from his wife for the movie class. And afraid that his wife would be lonely at home, he took out twenty yuan in banknotes and gave it to his wife, asking her to invite a few little sisters next door to play mahjong to relieve boredom. Mrs. Sun took the banknotes and no longer asked Mr. Sun to accompany her to the movies. Mr. Sun walked out of his door, secretly pleased, "This kind of woman is really annoying, she wants to go out together at every turn, today I'm relieved."</p>
<p>An hour later, Mr. Sun was placing bets in the roulette gambling place, and Mrs. Sun was inviting little sisters to play cards at home.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sun's son, Baoguan, was only nine years old. When he came back from school, he saw his mother, grabbed the corner of her clothes, and tore and缠缠 [Chanchan - cling], wanting his mother to accompany him to buy stone pencils and rubber balls. Mrs. Sun couldn't work because Baoguan was making a fuss, so she took out a handful of copper coins from beside her and gave them to Baoguan, telling him to go to the candy stall at the entrance of the alley to bet on candy to eat.</p>
<p>Baoguan got the money and no longer made a fuss. He went happily to bet on candy. When Mrs. Sun was playing cards, she felt relieved without Baoguan tearing and缠缠 beside her.</p>
<p>From then on, as soon as Mr. Sun left the writing room, he went to the roulette gambling place to place bets. As soon as Mrs. Sun got home, she invited little sisters to play cards to relieve boredom. As soon as Baoguan came back from school, he went to the entrance of the alley to bet on candy, developing a family habit of gambling.</p>
<p>Some say that Baoguan's liking for betting on candy was developed by Mrs. Sun. Mrs. Sun's liking for playing cards was developed by Mr. Sun. Mr. Sun's liking for roulette was developed by Lao Wang. Who developed Lao Wang's liking for roulette, I don't know.</p>
<p>Art End</p>
<h3>Mending-Poor Women Rope Wu</h3>
<p>No matter which lane or which road, in the morning or afternoon, there are often mending-poor women carrying ingot baskets coming and going, which is convenient for pedestrians. They neither shout loudly nor hoard goods to sell at a high price. They assess how life is, how much to charge for mending, and make a decisive decision without delay. We, the out-of-towners without family members, when our clothes are torn, we call them to mend them, when our socks are broken, we call them to darn them. Throughout the year, we invisibly get a lot of convenience and endless practical benefits. We should thank them deeply.</p>
<p>Why are they called mending-poor? Is it because they are poor and mend for others, so they are called mending-poor, or is it because they specialize in mending for poor people, so they are called mending-poor? I have asked many people, but there has not been even half a definitive answer. It is still a question.</p>
<p>Don't their ingot baskets each contain a pair of small stools? I once heard someone say, "If their stools have their four legs facing the sky, then they have another lover who is in a similar profession (shoemaker) in addition to their legally recognized husband." But I have carefully watched and never seen any stools facing the sky. Could it be that all mending-poor women are of bad character? I think the person who said this was probably deliberately trying to damage their reputation.</p>
<p>Let's not worry about their character. In short, they are beneficial to us drifters, so we should thank them and respect them.</p>
<p>Necessary</p>
<h3>The Pursuit of Wildflowers</h3>
<p>Flood</p>
<p>This is truly a one-act play about the future of China that I personally overheard in Zhaofeng Park.</p>
<p>One person, Yu Shihe, said, "As soon as we entered the park gate, the sun was extraordinarily bright, and the sky was extraordinarily blue and green!" A tall young man in a well-tailored Western suit said as he walked alongside a short, stout young man also in Western suit and leather shoes. "That's not necessarily true; it's more like breathing in the clean, fresh air is as refreshing as kissing a young woman."</p>
<p>"Exactly! This alone is worth the price of our 'skipping class'! Moreover..." He then raised a kind of "walking stick" used as an accessory, pointing it remotely towards the willow shade deep in the moving place, painted a semicircle and then said: "These beautiful and inexhaustible blessings are preparing for us to appreciate at will, just like opening an exhibition!"</p>
<p>"Who cares! No matter what, it can't compare to those 'all modern' female classmates in the 'Gathering of Heroes Studio' on the floor opposite our dormitory; it's a pity that the school has moved now, making one feel the 'carved railings and jade stairs should still be there, but the rosy faces have changed.'"</p>
<p>"Speaking of the closest vantage points in school, what about the Bai sisters in my class? But I always find them 'not as fragrant as wildflowers'!"</p>
<p>"Old Wang! I don't know how many thousands of times I've heard the famous Bai sisters in your mouth, but in reality, I'm afraid even their farts are hard to smell!"</p>
<p>"Old Wang! Don't overestimate the female students,"</p>
<p>"They also like to joke around with us! For example, in today's physics and chemistry class, because the noise from the second row of students was a bit loud, they made 'Shh...' sounds of scolding, but fortunately, a classmate shouted out a funny remark, 'Quick, bring a chamber pot, be careful the spring water leaks into the lecture hall,' which suppressed them with their faces flushed red."</p>
<p>"Ha... It's amazing that he could come up with such a surprising and effective joke on the spur of the moment, what a genius!"</p>
<p>"Heck! The day before yesterday, I even had a kind of relationship with them personally. When I was engrossed in reading Dream of the Red Chamber, suddenly a sound of scolding like an oriole complaining and a swallow getting angry, 'A good dog doesn't block the road,' gently entered my eardrums. Looking back, it turned out that the Bai sisters were standing gracefully..." Saying this, he actually supplemented it with a "looking back" pose and discovered a person wearing rubber-soled shoes (not the Bai sisters, but actually me) was closely following them listening in on their conversation, so he acted surprised, "changed the subject," and of course, I had to be sensible and slink off onto the grass. What kind of tricks this unfinished drama will perform later, there is no way to find out!</p>
<p>Movies</p>
<p>Iron Evidence Re-Releases Soon the blood case film Iron Evidence of a profligate woman, (The Silent Witness), which was once screened at the Nanjing Grand Theatre, stars Adhui. Adhui, with his genius for drama, stars in the film. The pinnacle of art and the deep impression of the performance on the hearts of people have long been admired by the ladies of Shanghai. It is a rare masterpiece. Now, the theater, in response to the enthusiastic demands of all walks of life, will re-screen the film on Friday and Saturday for two days to comfort those who have not seen this film and alleviate their desire to view it. It is said that the film will soon leave the port, so those who want to see it must not miss this good opportunity.</p>
<p>Four Horsemen to Be Released Tomorrow The Carlton Theatre will release the war epic Four Horsemen tomorrow (Friday). The war epic "All Quiet on the Western Front," which has shaken the world, has already won excellent reputation in the past. However, the film "Four Horsemen" is an unprecedented epic film made by the German film industry with all its strength to counter "All Quiet on the Western Front." Its depiction of war is more realistic than "All Quiet on the Western Front," and the spirit of soldiers who are unyielding and willing to sacrifice their lives for their country is even more admirable.</p>
<p>Historical War Masterpiece Lincoln The historical war masterpiece Lincoln is a masterpiece directed by master director Griffith and was selected as the second of the top ten films of 1931. Its intense plot, passionate performance, magnificent scenery, realistic battlefield, tragic military music, and noble purpose are unmatched by other films. When watching the exciting parts, people are inspired with loyalty and courage. The sad parts make people linger and want to die. It expresses infinite sympathy for this generation of great men and is a rare and excellent film. It will be released at the Paris Grand Theatre starting today. There are not many good seats, so please come early.</p>

<p>Huang Xiaochi Gives Away All His Flowers The calligrapher and painter Huang Xiaochi is famous for his landscapes and figures. In recent years, he has devoted himself to painting flowers and has gained a lot of experience. Because his flower works are not often seen, he is giving them away for a month. Each foot costs only one yuan for ink fees. For example, if you buy a four-foot screen, it only costs eight yuan (five feet cost ten yuan) and you get a free couplet. Mail address: No. 5, Xinxing Shunli, Ganshi East Road, French Concession, Shanghai, and various fan shops.</p>
