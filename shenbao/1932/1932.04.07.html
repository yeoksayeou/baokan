<p>時評</p>
<h3>前途黯淡之停戰撤兵會議彬</h3>
<p>上海中日停戰撤兵會議。自三月廿一日末次預備會議决定三項原則。進而自三月廿四日起舉行正式會議。迄今於四月四日集議十一次。停戰協定新草案正文五條。業已通過四條。惟第三條日軍撤退程序。雙方爭持不决。該條中「日軍退駐地點」一點。亦已由軍事小組委員會决定。引翔港江灣萬國體育塲兩處無異議。吳淞鎭與閘北二處則尙在爭持中。另一點「撤兵期限。」乃爲目前爭持之最大關鍵。雖大會今日又將繼續舉行。但此點如不能獲得合理之解决。會議前途。仍極爲黯淡。旬餘來之正式談判。或仍將付諸東流。</p>
<p>吾人廻溯停戰撤兵會議之產生。蓋爲依據於二月廿九日國聯理事會。及三月四日國聯大會兩决議案中「日軍撤退」之主要原則。從可知日方今日之百般刁難。。延不確定撤兵日期。且絕對無撤兵之誠意。爲根本違反國聯之决議</p>
<p>自會議開始至今。我方已一讓再讓。委曲求全。日方一面公表其在滬有兵五萬。戰馬五千。大小砲百五十尊。飛機五十架。以誇耀其軍的。另一面復積極備戰。且在前線挑釁。而我方公表。則不曰「雙方意見接近。」即曰「續有進展。」曰「友邦又有折中辦法。」嗚呼。此將何以對在嘉定太倉崑山等地犧牲身家性命財產擁護國軍作戰。損失十四萬萬元之上海一帶之人民。更何以對無數忠勇將士衛國自救之熱血。而來日之艱難與危機。足以令吾人焦慮者正多。吾人誠不解我政府於開始談判之先。固亦曾一體認日方意旨之所在否也。</p>
<p>日方之主張蓋分停戰撤兵爲兩事。停戰之條件必須我方承認取締排日運動保障僑民之安全。并組織共同委員會監視撤兵區域之行政事宜。觀乎三月三十一新聯社所傳日本軍部之態度。有謂「閘北江灣吳淞之綫。在用兵策略上絕對不能讓步若未得圓桌會議協定之前。便撤至租界毘連地點。是全然與放棄確保上海和平之出兵目的相等。故此點斷不能讓步。即使會議破裂。亦無可如何」之表示。與日荒木陸相「非成立停戰協定。舉行圓桌會議。不能達到出兵目的。故在其成立前。决不撤兵」之主張。即可知日方除非滿足其政治之要求。决無撤兵之誠意。吾人今且不言在撤兵之前開始和平之談判。爲辱國城下之盟。而在日方無誠意撤兵與故意刁難之下。委曲求全之城下之盟。又果能獲得若何之結局耶。</p>
<p>吾人處於當前情勢之下。默察會議前途。暗礁正多。從可知以公理殉和平。和平終於無以確立。吾人對於停戰撤兵會議。今敢再以嚴正之態度。表示吾人之主張</p>
<p>一。不承認日本有條件撤兵。併軍事問題與政治問題爲一談。</p>
<p>二。上海事件與東北事件。不容分别談判。</p>
<p>上列兩項原則。爲我人民最低限度之要求。深盼我政府予以審愼之注意。愼勿忽視其當前艱鉅之重責。</p>
<h3>停戰會議昨開小組會</h3>
<p>雙方定今午視察四處暫擬地　　正式會定今晨十時繼續開會停戰會議、昨日大會休會、小組會於下午三時繼續開會、已略有進步、并决定於今日下午二時、出發赴吳淞江灣引翔閘北四處、視察擬定日軍撤退駐軍地點、但會議前途關鍵、仍在時間問題、今晨正式會議、頗關重要、茲分誌各項消息如下、</p>
<h3>昨日小組會議</h3>
<p>昨日下午三時開會、討論日軍退駐地點、到我方代表十九路軍參謀長黃强及外交部秘書郭德華、日方代表陸軍參謀長田代皖一郎、關係國代表英使館軍事參贊桑希爾、美使館軍事參贊特萊斯台爾、法使館軍事參贊彭那維泰、意使館軍事參贊法拉鐵尼、會議至六時二十分、始散、當會議時、吾方代表黃强聲明、小組會議、迭次討論日軍撤退事宜、雙方意見、迄未接近、日方代表、對恢復一月二十八日前原狀問題、屢次聲明、日軍人馬過多、故於撤退時、必須於租界毘連地帶、劃出相當地點、暫時駐紮、以便乘輪歸國、華方爲諒解日軍苦衷起見、當即表示於租界毘連地帶、規定苦干點、暫供日軍駐紮、惟是時間問題、必須有明確之規定、乃以日方堅拒規定時間、致會議迄未成就、茲華方特鄭重聲明、日軍在撤退期間、因爲便利計、華方願於毘連地帶、暫時容許日軍留駐、惟苟無規定時間、則不特中國政府與民衆、均抱不安、且將令人疑及日軍有永久佔據之野心、苟時間問題而無確定答覆、則本會議之一切撤兵討論、亦屬全等於零、故希望於今日會議時、對撤兵一點、雙方能以誠意之接近、而明日正式會議中、亦能根據本會之討論、從速規定一撤退時間、庶停戰會議、得一圓滿之解决、黃氏發言竟、中立國代表等俱表示贊同、乃賡續討論撤兵問題、對前經討論之毘連地帶、是否適宜問題、討論殊久、而中日代表對撤兵地點之廣狹、爭執亦殊激烈、</p>
<h3>今日視察地點</h3>
<p>旋經詳細研究、聞㈠吳淞方面之撤兵區、暫擬定吳淞鎭薀藻浜張華浜、包括張華浜車站、東面濱黃浦江、成一半圓形之地點、但前次會議日方所要求之擴充範圍、包括吳淞砲臺·及曹家橋·在内、現已取消、㈡江灣方面、東北自殷行鎭、西南臨萬國體育塲、成一長圓形之地點、㈢閘北方面、在橫浜橋東、包括六三花園、日本公墓、及天通菴車站、成一三角形之地點、㈣引翔港方面、東臨黃浦江、南接公共租界楊樹浦東端、包括滬江大學及引翔港鎭、成一扇面形之地點、但以上四處、雙方同意、不得妨碍交通、因之吳淞方面之張華浜車站、及閘北方面之天通菴車站、均可通車、不碍及交通、並經我方代表鄭重聲明、如日軍最後撤退日期未定、則認爲無效、雙方面爲詳細討論起見、并决定雙方代表及各國武官分乘汽車四部、於今日下午二時起、自英領署出發、前往以上四處視察、約於晚間可回滬、屆時再定期開</p>
<h3>小組會議公報</h3>
<p>中日停戰會議委員會、昨於散會後、發表公報云、「今晨小組會議、略有進步、對日軍撤退地點及是否適宜問題、討論甚詳、現定明日下午二時、中日雙方代表暨中立國代表、同往日軍撤退地點視察、本會定視察而後、再行定期繼續商洽」云、</p>
<h3>今日上午會議</h3>
<p>停戰撤兵正式會議、今日上午十時、繼續舉行、吾方出席代表、業已接到政府訓令、對日軍撤退時間、務須於大會中明確規定、不得讓步、至於日方代表、昨日亦已接到東京電訓、關於規定撤退時間、須堅决拒絕、並不得退讓、否則即决裂亦所不惜、</p>
<h3>英美兩使會商</h3>
<p>中日停戰會議、連日情形險惡、昨日東京消息、尤屬强硬、且擬待今日正式會議中、實行决裂、前方立即開始自由行動、此項消息、殊使各界不安、英公使藍浦森、特於昨日下午三時、約同美使詹森、商洽一切、達半小時、美使始行辭去、聞英美兩使、對於停戰會議險惡情形、决定繼續努力調解云、</p>
<h3>日方態度一斑</h3>
<p>大陸報云、日總領事署發言人昨日接見大陸報記者時、對於中日談判、已放棄向來所持之可望成功論調、承認前途黯淡、但謂各代表苟見有一線成功希望、必傾全力以赴之、據昨夜路透電訊、日政府已决定對於中國要求不再讓步、此項新訓令、料於今晨可抵上海重光公使處、諒本埠日人聞之、對於會議、當更形悲觀也、昨日日總領事署發言人切實聲稱、日代表不能同意於撤兵時限、日政府固願逐漸撤兵、但不能規定軍隊撤退日期、此事成須一月、或再較久、記者詢曰、或將三月、日方發言人對曰、然、記者又詢曰、然則甚或須十年乎、日方發言人亦笑答曰、然、或將十年、又據中立方面消息、會議之成功、猶非完全無望、但其希望殊爲些微、目下中立國代表正盡力幹旋、期能獲致雙方同意、昨日中立國代表曾作非正式討論、其主要目的、則在覓致能使雙方滿意之辦法、</p>
<h3>日方限期撤兵條件</h3>
<p>要我保證參加圓桌會路透社六日東京電云、聞日當局允授權駐華公使重光葵正式聲明、一俟上海一帶時局平穩、日僑生命財產、及其合法事業、得有充分保障、日軍當可撤至公共租界及越界築路以内、恢復一月二十八日前之原狀、日當局并擬訓令重光、如中國方面切實允諾、於簽訂休戰協定後、參加圓桌會議、日政府準備考慮更進一步之退讓、即規定最後撤兵時期亦在考慮範圍之内云、</p>
<h3>上海時局前途國聯轉增焦慮</h3>
<p>特委會定十一日重開國民社五日日内瓦電　此間對於上海時局轉增焦慮、因據東京消息、日本對於撤兵地點與時期、已决定不再讓步、即談判因此决裂亦所不惜、日陸軍省已擬定和議决裂後之應付辦法、目下大有靜待决裂之態、而消息靈通者、甚至預料四月七日開中日代表會議時、即將决裂、日當局目下亦認談判前途絕少可得切實結果之望、蓋此次上海日軍田代參謀長回國報告中日談判詳情後、日軍部要人業於本日與外務省重要人物會商今後方針、陸軍方面對於中國要求日軍撤回一月二十八日以前原防、與規定撤完期限二層、竭力反對、主張無論中國如何要求、日軍將繼續佔領眞如·大場·廟行·獅子林一帶最大限度亦祗能撤至閘北·大塲·吳淞·三處、外務省當局亦與軍部同意、因此遂决定對於中國要求不再退讓、即上海談判因此破裂、亦所不惜、現日本態度既如此强硬、此間人士咸料和議前途已不絕如縷、因此國聯大會專辦遠東事件之特别委員會、已定於四月十一日再行開會、討論上海時局問題、</p>
<h3>顏惠慶向國聯報告日軍挑釁眞相</h3>
<p>路透社五日日内瓦電云、中國總代表顏惠慶博士、今日根據蔣光鼐之報告、通知國聯秘書長、否認日人所稱、華軍與日軍在太倉西北邊境互相射擊之說、惟聲明三月三十一夜之射擊、實日本便衣兵攻擊華軍陣地所致、</p>

<h3>孝脫上尉傳</h3>
<p>— 王遞常</p>
<p>上尉姓孝脫氏。名勞勃脫。美利堅華盛頓州泰科瑪鄉人也。爲人肫摯而鏠俠。習航空有聲。任職於其國蓋爾飛車（飛機歐西人又名飛車飛車之名甚古我國湯時已有之見帝王世紀）公司。主馭。旋來吾國上海時廢居。（據蓋爾公司蓋爾君言）遂兼任我國航空敎士。與吾國之習航空者多契。今歲日侵上海。見其殘虐無人理。義憤之色。時流溢於眉宇。二月廿一日。忽變服至吳淞。狙擊日飛機。碎其一。二十三日。聞敵飛炸蘇州之耗。立馭一飛機曰波林者。躡其後。遇飛機六。方肆虐於吾蘇民。敵見上尉至。遽上下遮迣而萃攻之。上尉知無幸。然猶從容力禦碎其一機。殲厥渠魁。（據大陸報及泰晤士報）卒以殉。年二十有七。（據上尉致蓋爾公司之文告）耗聞。我國人皆震悼。國議追贈上尉。以軍禮葬於吾國土。異數也王　常曰。我聞方事之殷。上尉語所親曰。我中立國人也。固無所袒於其間。第人類而見非人類之殘殺。我安能忍。我安能忍。我爲正誼人道計。不容與兩立矣。縱死。亦心所甘。我何憾。然未死。愼勿聲。死則報我父母耳。（據二月二十五日時事新報夕刋）嗚呼。上尉今竟以正誼人道死。上尉其無憾矣。然今之非人類之殘殺。猶日肆而無已。上尉其終能無憾乎。上尉以異國人而不忍我國人蒙非人類之殘殺。扶義而起終至投死而無憾。以視同踐國之土。同食國之毛。獨熟視其國之人宰割呼號而無覩。或竟遠走高飛心自保者。則上尉之死。有似乎不智。上尉其果能無憾乎。嗚呼。</p>
<h3>義勇軍之三頭主義</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>古之賢者。言治民猶治目。治兵猶治齒。治目者務養其目。不得着以塵屑。治齒者務剔其齒。不許容其積垢。嗚嘑。今之治民者。皆塵悄蔽其目。而治兵者皆積垢滿其口。故一任敵宼之蹂躪國境。坐視民衆之塗炭。而曾不稍動於其心。是豈吾人所料哉。</p>
<p>今日吾東北靑年。起而當自决自衛自救之重任以與敵軍抗。厥名曰『義勇』。其志則甚壯。其行實可憐。顧義勇軍不自東北始。即滬上亦嘗組織成隊。參加作戰。負起救亡抗暴之責。唯念我國人。在此存亡絕續之秋。須大澈大悟者。有必要之三點。㈠須明白如人人說在口頭。是徒託空言。㈡須明白如執筆頭來寫幾句。亦屬紙上談兵。㈢須明白無論痛切之標語。貼在墻頭敵國始終未嘗看見。故吾以爲今日義勇軍之所以能殺敵致果者。不在一時之血性。而尤在堅韌不拔一致之毅力與决心。爰媵以俚詞。爲熱誠愛國者告救國與其在口頭。口頭不如在心頭。心頭牢記勿忘却。終有一日可報讐。救國與其在筆頭。筆頭不如在槍頭。槍頭瞄準可殺敵。一發一彈志已酬。　救國與其在墻頭。墻頭不如在城頭。城頭堅守敵莫破。功在黨國名亦留。</p>
<h3>滬戰與軍器㈠</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>從上古工矢刀箭時代。到了槍砲萬能的時代。殺人利器的進步。不知已費了多少的精力。然而到了今日。那些殺人的傢伙。又没有用了。爲仁麽呢。今日所用的軍器。跟了科學的進步。戰爭的經騐。和各種技術的改良。實有出人意外的奥妙。我們說到軍器。可把一九一四年世界大戰爲劃分期。大戰以後到了現今中日戰爭。就是這回日軍使用最新式的軍器。又可劃分爲一時期。因爲這十餘年來科學工藝的尖銳化。眞使我們不可思議。</p>
<p>回溯封建時代的武士。身披甲冑。佩帶弓箭刀劍。以爲自衛。現今的步兵。則用鐵兜·鐵馬夾·假面目·手溜彈·手槍·步槍·擲彈器等。·以爲個人的防禦。個人防備以外。還有什麽部隊防備。這種防備的方法。愈弄愈妙。神奇莫測。推其所以能到這樣的地步。完全是列强各國。以過去戰役的貴重體念爲緯。以現代科學的精髓爲經。極力改良裝置而成功的。他們爲維持本國的存立起見。不惜巨大的經費準備未來的大戰。現在我把軍器的沿革與最近淞滬戰爭日軍所用的新式軍器分類的說明概要。那就可以知道這回戰事的慘酷了。</p>
<h3>或馬雙樓記（二七）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第四回婚約逼人來游移自擾宼氛掠地去釁始重開</p>
<p>安玉田這時身陷重圍。眼見得成了敵人的俘虜。不獨脫逃無計。而且還俯首帖耳的不敢有一絲半絲的掙扎。就趕忙大聲乞降道。放手罷。你說得有理。我當然是贊同的。說過後。李問霞欣喜得剛剛把纖手一鬆。安玉田忽又躊躇著道。不過還須等我與魏卓謀先生商議一下。才能决定呢。李問霞猛聽他似又在狡詞延宕</p>
<p>。不由把剛弛緩過的手勁。又重復緊張起來。死命抓牢了他的胳膀。睜大了眼珠咄咄逼人般重行追問道。你說什麽。這種男女婚愛上的事情。你自己還不能作主嗎。憑什麽却要問魏先生。看將來你呀。···說到這。這底下的語句。本預備痛責他是太没人心。太無誠意。不應該對一個愛你的弱女子。使這種巧言搪塞的奸滑手叚。可是私下裏好似有一瓶醋潑翻在心臟中。酸溜溜的浸泡得十分難受。兩行熱淚似</p>
<p>撒豆般從眼眶邊迸出。聲音哽咽著就再也說不下去了。安玉田一看局勢更加不妙。與蜜斯們鬥口舌。是永遠得不著勝利的。便採用弱國外交的方法。先之以道歉。而繼之以解釋道。這又是我的錯。一句話没說得俐落又惹得你傷心啦。但你也未免有些誤會。我所以要與魏先生商量的。是請他在你我宣布婚約時作一個正式介紹人。并非是將這個大問題去取决于他呀。這一說。掩飾得倒很巧妙。李問霞果就轉悲爲喜。破涕成歡。既取消了要挾刦持的示威運動。又慢慢揩拭凈素頰上淚珠點點的啼痕。另換上一副溫存熨貼的態度。將安玉田仍扶到床邊并排兒坐定。·繼續再把宣布婚約時那種種必要的手續。細細提出來逐一討論。甚至還靦覥著似偶不經心的一般。又遠遠地牽涉到同居問題中的種種設備上頭去。安玉田好容易挽回到雲散天靑。風平浪靜。能得著一時的苟安。自然是小心謹愼。不敢再惹麻煩。凡是伊所問所說。總不外夫將話答話。無一處不迎合伊的心意。便勾引得伊疑慮全消。身心俱暢。</p>

<h3>國聯調查團失竊白色鐵箱</h3>
<p>— 金</p>
<p>國聯調查團一行，於四月一日，由京登隆和輪船北上，而李頓爵士之白色鐵箱，忽告失踪，若此訊果然非虚，則不能不認爲這是一椿希奇特别，而重要的竊案·</p>
<p>調查團及代表處的行李，託中國旅行社運送，外交部曾派專員帮同照料，如此鄭重將事，而李頓爵士的白色鐵箱，竟不翼而飛，試問旅行社運送些什麽？專員照料什麽？在旅行社與專員疏忽鹵莽之咎，果然百口難辭·</p>
<p>所奇者，此次調查團及代表處之行李，人數既多，行李天然也不在少數，何以該項行李中，他人的物偏偏不少，而獨少李頓爵士的白色鐵箱，則該竊賊的用意，不難猜測而知，李頓爵士雖在船中，工作不輟，各處往來電報均一一裁答，則李頓爵士的白色鐵箱，其中</p>
<p>關係十分重要，亦不難猜測而知·　　惟該項行李既托旅行社運送，政府又加派專員照料，而該竊賊竟妙手空空，不假吹灰之力，竊負而逃·我不能不認該竊賊手段之高明，昔陸增祥赴巴黎和會，道出橫濱，裝有重要文件之一箱，亦不翼而飛，適與此次竊賊，同一手腕，好生奇怪·</p>
<p>金銀財物，爲竊賊的惟一目標·而此項竊賊，不竊金銀財物，而獨竊重要文書，與平常竊賊，大異其趣，此種竊賊，我何以名之，名之曰政治上的竊賊，若簡單言之，名曰政賊·</p>

<h3>跛丐行</h3>
<p>— 王敖溪</p>
<p>夜過南京路。跛丐隨我行。一跛一求乞。兩眼淚交縈。我問因何哭。丐言有情陳。我家住江北。有田可自耕。去秋洪水至。田舍一齊傾。敢怪治水吏。祇自暗呑聲。負母逃滬上。賃屋在橫浜。妻兒日號泣。無米可爲烹。我乃拉車去。我妻亦傭身。小兒剛成歲半。抱孫賴母親。母爲人漿洗。較我更苦辛。苦辛自苦辛。幸尙樂昇平。那知一二八。謠傳有戰爭。我妻被解僱。歸來淚滿巾。據云諸闊老。舉家逃大英。問我逃也未。望我勿因循。我道我窮鬼。何苦自着驚。依然拉車去。奔走到三更。忽聽槍聲起。倭賊果逞橫。我因歸不得。日依車爲生。宕延十餘日。和平終無神。有車無人坐。無計可療貧。倭賊眞可恨害我成難民。决計投軍去。遂賊回東京。瞥見義勇隊。相隨請長纓。訓練僅七日。遂赴廟行征。鏖戰三畫夜。誓將怨氣伸。飛機坦克車。敵勢倍獰猙。砲彈更雨密。當者化爲塵。我脛因以裂。就醫蘇州城。我傷尙未愈。我軍忽撤營。我傷既已愈。我隊又解盟。本擬再入伍。與賊决输贏。奈我足跛矣。那能上征程。欲入廢兵院。無處可問津。往懇軍政部。無那非正兵。狼狽奔回滬。探我家中人。我居成灰燼。但見骨嶙嶙。剩此一廢物。不死亦不生。我恨司令者。其心何不仁。既不守淞滬。底甚苦爭衡。江山本爲重。性命本爲輕。如能長抵抗。誰不願犧牲。抗而終不抗。犧牲爲何因。害我如此甚。何以度殘春。先生施惻隱。賞我數角銀。少看一次戲。救我活幾旬。我聞跛丐語。哀餘繼以嗔。何不尋司令。一究此中情。</p>

<h3>無線電影</h3>
<p>— ＴＷ</p>
<p>近年以來，科學之發達，幾有一日千里之勢，昔日驚人之理想，今日已成爲日常事物，騰空駕雲，則有飛行機，千里傳信，則有電報，異地談心，則有電話，今且縮地有術，透視無阻，吾人非特能聞遠處之語聲音樂，且能安坐家中觀看異地之景色人物，誰謂千里眼之</p>
<p>不能實現哉？</p>
<p>無綫電影(Tlevision)者，用電力傳送一地之活動景物至異地之方法也，航空術發明之後，此爲科學界最大之新發明物，一九○九年美人囂俄根斯白克，首先應用此Teleusion一字，二十餘年以來，從事研究無綫電影之科學家，遍於全世界，研究而成功者，有美國柏爾電話實騐室諸科學家，及英人貝耳德氏，皆製有靈騐之無線電影發送器及接收器，茲將兩種器具之原理及作用，略述於后，</p>
<p>無線電話之播送及接收也，先在播送台使聲浪，變爲電波，使通過空間之以太而至收音器，再由電波變爲聲浪，無線電影之收發亦類此，先在播送台使發自人面或物面之光波變爲電波，由空間傳至收影器，再由電波變爲光波，無線電影中最重要之物，即爲改變光波爲</p>
<p>電波之感光電池，（Photo-electric　Cell)及改變電波爲光波之氞氣管，(Neon　Tube)前者有「電目」之稱，乃感光性極强之電池，光線射於其上時，即變爲電流，光線强電流亦强，反之，光線弱電流亦弱，若無光線電流亦無，後者爲滿貯氞氣之管，通電流後即發光，電流强所發之光亦强，電流弱光亦弱，若無電流則亦黑暗無光矣，</p>
<p>然僅如上述之傳遞法，收影器所得之影像，亦不過一片模糊耳，此因光線合併使然，解决此難題，須用間光物，柏爾式之無線電影收發器所用之間光物，爲旋轉空孔團盤，盤上有孔五十，排列於螺旋盤上，傳遞影像時，先用强光照射所傳遞之人面或物面，並使圓船迅船旋轉，人面所及射之光線依次通過圓速之孔，丨即第一光線通過第一孔，第二光線通過第二孔，餘可類推一而射於感光電池上，變爲强弱不同之電流，惟此電流太微弱，不足供傳遞之用，乃用放大器放大之，然後使經過天線而，傳至空間，再載送至接收器之天線而，導至接收器，當有放大器將收得之，電流放大傳至氞氣管，此管即依電流之强弱，而發强度相當之光線，復使光線通過一旋轉有孔之圓盤，其大小位置及旋轉速度，與播送台之盤完全相同，丨兩盤之同等速度，係用同期電動機控制之，丨光線依次通過旋轉盤後，最後射於幕上，而成原物之影像矣，</p>
<p>此法不啻將人面分爲二千五百小方，（縱橫各五十）使成强弱不同之光點，依次飛散，經過空間而復集合於收影器上，成本來面目，因其飛散及集合異常迅速，且人目有留像之作用，故不能辨其先後，而但覺其全部同時顯現耳，貝耳德式之收發器，與此相仿，所不同者，貝氏以十六透鏡代五十小孔，而用一齒狀圓盤爲間光物耳，</p>

<h3>The Dim Future of the Ceasefire and Troop Withdrawal Conference in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Ceasefire and Troop Withdrawal Conference in Shanghai. Since the final preparatory meeting on March 21st established three principles, progressing to the official meeting held from March 24th, there have been eleven meetings as of April 4th. Of the five articles in the new draft ceasefire agreement, four have already been passed. However, Article 3, concerning the procedure for Japanese troop withdrawal, remains a point of contention between the two sides. The "location of Japanese troop redeployment" within this article has also been decided by the Military Subcommittee, with no objections to the Yinxiang Port and Jiangwan International Recreation Ground locations. Wusong Town and Zhabei, however, remain under dispute. Another point, "the deadline for troop withdrawal," is currently the biggest key to the contention. Although the general meeting will continue today, if this point cannot be resolved reasonably, the future of the conference remains extremely bleak. The formal negotiations of the past ten days or so may still come to naught.</p>
<p>When we look back at the genesis of the Ceasefire and Troop Withdrawal Conference, it was based on the main principle of "Japanese troop withdrawal" in the resolutions of the League of Nations Council on February 29th and the League of Nations General Assembly on March 4th. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese side's various acts of obstruction today, delaying the determination of a troop withdrawal date, and the absolute lack of sincerity for troop withdrawal, are fundamentally in violation of the League of Nations' resolution.</p>
<p>Since the conference began, our side has yielded and compromised again and again, seeking complete accommodation. The Japanese side, on the one hand, publicly announced that it has 50,000 troops, 5,000 war horses, 150 large and small cannons, and 50 aircraft in Shanghai to boast of its military might. On the other hand, it is actively preparing for war and provoking on the front lines. Our side, when making public announcements, says nothing but "opinions are close between the two sides," or "continued progress is being made," or "friendly countries have new compromise measures." Alas! How can this be justified to the people of the Shanghai area, who have sacrificed their lives, property, and possessions in Jiading, Taicang, Kunshan, and other places to support the national army in combat, suffering losses of 140 million yuan? How can this be justified to the countless loyal and brave soldiers who shed their blood to defend the country and save themselves? The difficulties and crises of the future are enough to make us anxious, and there are many of them. We truly do not understand whether our government had a full understanding of the Japanese side's intentions before the start of negotiations.</p>
<p>The Japanese side's position is to separate the ceasefire from the troop withdrawal into two separate matters. The conditions for a ceasefire require our side to acknowledge the suppression of anti-Japanese movements, guarantee the safety of overseas Chinese, and organize a joint committee to monitor the administrative affairs of the withdrawal area. Looking at the attitude of the Japanese military, as reported by the Xinlian News Agency on March 31st, it said, "The line of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong is absolutely non-negotiable in terms of military strategy. If we withdraw to a location adjacent to the concessions before an agreement is reached in the round table conference, it is entirely equivalent to abandoning the purpose of dispatching troops to ensure peace in Shanghai. Therefore, this point is absolutely non-negotiable. Even if the conference breaks down, there is no other way." Coupled with the claim by Japanese Minister of the Army Araki that "We cannot achieve the purpose of dispatching troops unless a ceasefire agreement is established and a round table conference is held. Therefore, we will never withdraw troops before it is established." It can be seen that the Japanese side has absolutely no sincerity in withdrawing troops unless it satisfies its political demands. We will now not even discuss the fact that starting peace negotiations before the troop withdrawal is a humiliating treaty of surrender. But under the circumstances of the Japanese side's lack of sincerity in withdrawing troops and deliberate obstruction, what kind of outcome can a treaty of surrender achieved through complete accommodation really achieve?</p>
<p>Under the current situation, silently observing the future of the conference, there are many hidden reefs. From this, we can see that using justice to seek peace, peace will ultimately not be established. Regarding the Ceasefire and Troop Withdrawal Conference, we now dare to express our views again with a serious attitude:</p>
<p>1.  Do not recognize conditional troop withdrawal by Japan, and discuss military issues and political issues together.</p>
<p>2.  The Shanghai Incident and the Northeast Incident must not be negotiated separately.</p>
<p>The above two principles are the minimum demands of our people. We deeply hope that our government will pay careful attention to them and not neglect its important and arduous responsibilities at present.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire Conference Held Subcommittee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Both Sides Agreed to Inspect the Four Proposed Sites This Afternoon. Official Meeting Scheduled to Continue at 10:00 AM This Morning. The ceasefire conference held a recess from the general meeting yesterday, and the subcommittee meeting continued at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, with slight progress. It was also decided that at 2:00 PM this afternoon, they would depart to Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinxiang, and Zhabei to inspect the proposed locations for Japanese troop withdrawal and garrison. However, the key to the future of the conference remains the time issue. This morning's official meeting is quite important. The various news items are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Subcommittee Meeting</h3>
<p>The meeting started at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss the location of Japanese troop redeployment. The attendees were Huang Qiang, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army and Guo Dehua, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs representing our side, Tashiro Kanichirō, Chief of Staff of the Army representing the Japanese side, and military attaches from related countries, including Sandys-Hill, military attaché of the British Embassy, Tracy Streeter, military attaché of the American Embassy, Penaviate, military attaché of the French Embassy, and Faratini, military attaché of the Italian Embassy. The meeting adjourned at 6:20 PM. During the meeting, our representative Huang Qiang stated that the subcommittee meetings had repeatedly discussed the issue of Japanese troop withdrawal, but the opinions of both sides had not yet converged. The Japanese representative repeatedly stated on the issue of restoring the original state before January 28th that the Japanese army was too large in number, so when withdrawing, it must demarcate a considerable area in the zone adjacent to the concession for temporary stationing in order to board ships and return home. In order to understand the plight of the Japanese army, the Chinese side immediately expressed that a number of points could be designated in the zone adjacent to the concession for temporary stationing of the Japanese army. However, the issue of time must have a clear provision. However, the Japanese side firmly refused to specify a time, resulting in the failure of the meeting. The Chinese side solemnly declared that during the withdrawal period of the Japanese army, the Chinese side is willing to temporarily allow the Japanese army to stay in the adjacent zone for convenience, but if there is no specified time, not only will the Chinese government and the people feel uneasy, but it will also cause people to suspect that the Japanese army has the ambition to permanently occupy. If there is no definite answer to the time issue, then all discussions on troop withdrawal at this meeting will be completely equal to zero. Therefore, it is hoped that in today's meeting, both sides can approach the withdrawal point with sincerity, and in tomorrow's official meeting, they can also quickly specify a withdrawal time based on the discussions of this meeting, so that the ceasefire conference can achieve a satisfactory solution. After Huang's speech, the representatives of the neutral countries all expressed their agreement. Then, the discussion on the issue of troop withdrawal continued. The discussion on the suitability of the adjacent zone previously discussed was particularly long, and the Chinese and Japanese representatives also fiercely debated the extent of the troop withdrawal location.</p>
<h3>Places to be Inspected Today</h3>
<p>After detailed study, it is reported that 1) The withdrawal area on the Wusong side is tentatively set as Wusong Town, Yunzaobang, and Zhanghuabang, including Zhanghuabang Station, bordering the Huangpu River in the east, forming a semi-circular location, but the expansion range requested by the Japanese side in the previous meeting, including Wusong Fort and Caojiaqiao, has now been cancelled; 2) The Jiangwan area is northeast of Yinhang Town and southwest of the International Recreation Ground, forming a long oval location; 3) The Zhabei area is east of Yokohama Bridge, including the No. 63 Garden, the Japanese Cemetery, and Tiantong'an Station, forming a triangular location; 4) The Yinxiang Port area borders the Huangpu River in the east and connects to the eastern end of Yangshupu in the public concession in the south, including Shanghai University and Yinxiang Port Town, forming a fan-shaped location. However, both sides agreed that the above four places should not hinder traffic. Therefore, Zhanghuabang Station on the Wusong side and Tiantong'an Station on the Zhabei side can both be open to traffic without hindering traffic. Our representative also solemnly stated that it would be considered invalid if the final withdrawal date of the Japanese army is not determined. For the sake of detailed discussion by both sides, it was also decided that the representatives of both sides and the military attaches of various countries would take four cars starting from the British Consulate at 2:00 PM this afternoon to inspect the above four places, and they could return to Shanghai in the evening, and then schedule a meeting.</p>
<h3>Press Release of the Subcommittee Meeting</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Ceasefire Conference Committee issued a press release after the adjournment yesterday, saying, "This morning's subcommittee meeting made slight progress, and the location of Japanese troop withdrawal and its suitability were discussed in detail. It is now scheduled for 2:00 PM tomorrow afternoon, with representatives from China and Japan and representatives from neutral countries going to inspect the Japanese troop withdrawal location together. The meeting will schedule a continued consultation after the inspection,"</p>
<h3>Meeting this Morning</h3>
<p>The official ceasefire and troop withdrawal meeting will continue at 10:00 AM this morning. Our representatives have already received instructions from the government that the withdrawal time of the Japanese army must be clearly specified at the general meeting and no concessions should be made. As for the Japanese representatives, they also received a telegram from Tokyo yesterday, stating that they must resolutely refuse to specify a withdrawal time and not concede, otherwise they will not hesitate to break down.</p>
<h3>British and American Envoys Confer</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese ceasefire conference has been in a dangerous situation for days. Yesterday's news from Tokyo was particularly tough, and it was planned to implement a breakdown in today's official meeting and immediately start free action on the front line. This news caused particular unease in all circles. British Minister Lampson specially invited American Minister Johnson at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss everything, and the American envoy left after half an hour. It is reported that the British and American envoys decided to continue their efforts to mediate the dangerous situation of the ceasefire conference.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Japanese Attitude</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that the spokesman of the Japanese Consul General's Office, when meeting with a reporter from the Continental Daily News yesterday, abandoned the optimistic tone he had always held regarding the Sino-Japanese negotiations and admitted that the future was bleak, but said that if the representatives see a glimmer of hope for success, they will do their best to pursue it. According to a Reuters telegram last night, the Japanese government has decided not to make any more concessions to China's demands. This new instruction is expected to arrive at Ambassador Shigemitsu's office in Shanghai this morning. It is expected that the Japanese in this port will become even more pessimistic about the conference after hearing this. The spokesman of the Japanese Consul General's Office firmly stated yesterday that the Japanese representatives cannot agree to a deadline for troop withdrawal. The Japanese government is willing to gradually withdraw troops, but it cannot specify a date for the troops to withdraw. This matter will take a month, or even longer. The reporter asked, "Perhaps three months?" The Japanese spokesman replied, "Yes." The reporter asked again, "Then perhaps it will take ten years?" The Japanese spokesman also laughed and replied, "Yes, perhaps ten years." According to neutral sources, the success of the conference is not entirely hopeless, but the hope is very slight. Currently, representatives from neutral countries are doing their best to mediate in the hope of reaching an agreement between the two sides. Yesterday, representatives from neutral countries held informal discussions, the main purpose of which was to find a solution that could satisfy both sides.</p>
<h3>Japanese Conditions for Limiting Troop Withdrawal</h3>
<p>Requires Me to Guarantee Participation in the Roundtable Conference. Reuters, Tokyo, 6th – It is reported that the Japanese authorities have agreed to authorize Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi in China to formally declare that once the situation in the Shanghai area is stable, the lives and property of Japanese residents and their legitimate businesses are fully guaranteed, the Japanese army can withdraw to within the public concession and the extra-territorial road construction, restoring the original state before January 28th. The Japanese authorities also intend to instruct Shigemitsu that if the Chinese side sincerely promises to participate in the roundtable conference after signing the ceasefire agreement, the Japanese government is prepared to consider further concessions, and even specifying the final withdrawal period is within the scope of consideration.</p>
<h3>The League of Nations is Increasingly Anxious about the Future of the Shanghai Situation</h3>
<p>The Special Committee is scheduled to reconvene on the 11th. National News Agency, Geneva, 5th – There is increasing anxiety here about the situation in Shanghai, because according to news from Tokyo, Japan has decided not to make any more concessions on the location and timing of the troop withdrawal, and it will not hesitate to break down the negotiations as a result. The Japanese Ministry of the Army has drafted response measures after the breakdown of the peace talks, and there is currently a strong attitude of waiting for the breakdown. Well-informed sources even predict that the meeting of Chinese and Japanese representatives on April 7th will break down. The Japanese authorities also believe that there is very little hope of achieving concrete results in the negotiations, because after Tashiro, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, returned home to report on the details of the Sino-Japanese negotiations, the key figures of the Japanese military consulted with important figures from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the future policy on this day. The army vigorously opposed the Chinese demands for the Japanese army to withdraw to the original defense before January 28th and to specify the completion deadline, arguing that no matter how China demands, the Japanese army will continue to occupy the areas of Zhenru, Dachang, Miaohang, and Shizilin to the maximum extent, and can only withdraw to the three places of Zhabei, Dachang, and Wusong. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities also agreed with the military, so it was decided not to make any more concessions to China's demands, and it will not hesitate to break down the Shanghai negotiations as a result. Now that Japan's attitude is so tough, people here generally believe that the future of the peace talks is hanging by a thread. Therefore, the Special Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly responsible for Far Eastern affairs has scheduled to reconvene on April 11th to discuss the Shanghai situation.</p>
<h3>Yan Huiqing Reports to the League of Nations on the Truth of Japanese Military Provocations</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 5th – Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Yan Huiqing today notified the Secretary-General of the League of Nations based on Chiang Kwang-nai's report, denying the Japanese claim that Chinese and Japanese troops were shooting at each other on the northwestern border of Taicang, but stated that the shooting on the night of March 31st was in fact caused by Japanese plainclothes soldiers attacking Chinese army positions.</p>
<h3>Small Contact in the Front</h3>
<p>Special Telegram from Kunshan, 6th – At 8:00 AM on the 6th, another small unit of the enemy, about dozens of people, attacked the vicinity of Hengli Bridge in Taicang. Our army returned fire and they retreated.</p>
<p>Special Telegram from Suzhou, 6th – On the morning of the 6th, an enemy plainclothes team and our Wangjiashi Security Regiment fought for one hour in Fuqiao Jiuqu Town, killing four enemies and capturing one gun, and one member of the regiment was injured. Fang Songtai, a treacherous merchant in Nanxiang, previously borrowed 500 piculs of rice from the enemy and sought to become the county magistrate of Jiading.

In an instant, another five Japanese planes came in formation. First, they soared in the air to inspect, and then they descended, circling five times at a low altitude of only ten feet from the roof. After ascertaining that it was indeed an American plane, they all flew east.</p>

<h3>Four More Japanese Warships Arrived in the Huangpu River Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Transportation is Busy Again. The Number of Japanese Warships in the Huangpu River Has Increased Greatly.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Come and Go</h3>
<p>Since the day before yesterday, Japanese warships coming and going to Shanghai have suddenly become busy again, mostly with military supplies and transportation equipment. At 10:40 AM yesterday, two destroyers from the 13th Team arrived in Shanghai from Japan. At 11:00 AM, two more destroyers from the 13th Team continued to enter the port, followed by a transport ship loaded with military equipment, food, guns, ammunition, etc., as well as a batch of soldiers, who were also loaded from the transport ship and escorted by the 13th Team to Yangshupu, where they anchored in front of the Huangpu Wharf.

<h3>Representatives of the Reopening Association Visited Fei Xindun Yesterday</h3>
<p>Increase Police to Protect the Reopening of the Hongkou Area. Director Fei Agreed to Discuss with the Police Department. The various businesses in the Hongkou District of this city dare not rush to open for business until the Municipal Council provides effective protection. They have sent letters to the Citizens' Union for relief. After deliberation by the Reopening Committee, at 3:00 PM yesterday, representatives Jiang Junyi, Qu Zhenhua, Zhou Fuzhang, and others were sent to visit Fei Xindun, Director of the Public Concession Municipal Council, with a letter. The original letter is recorded below: "Dear Sir, Our Association previously sent a letter to your Director on March 30th regarding the problems of reopening guarantees, etc., and sent representatives to offer opinions. At that time, your Director gave a satisfactory reply in words, promising to handle it immediately, and said that after consultation, he would reply in writing. A week has passed in the blink of an eye, and no reply has been received. Now, all stores in our association, except for the Hongkou District, have opened for business on April 1st, but in the Hongkou area, because Japanese soldiers are still armed and patrolling the streets, people's hearts are difficult to stabilize. They dare not rush to open for business until the Municipal Council provides effective guarantees. Therefore, we have written to you again and sent Jiang Junyi, Qu Zhenhua, and Zhou Fuzhang as representatives to contact everything. The matter concerns the reopening guarantees, and we hope that your Director will quickly investigate and handle it." Director Fei immediately cited the five proposed measures discussed last time, as well as the opinions of the Chief Patrol and others, and discussed them item by item. He also said that after the previous conversation, the number of Chinese and Western police officers in the Hongkou area has already increased, and the number of increases is unprecedented. The Chief Patrol believes that it is sufficient to maintain protection, so there should be no problems with the reopening of the Hongkou District. The representatives believed that the Municipal Council should continue to find ways to prevent Japanese soldiers from guarding posts, and must increase the number of police officers again in order to stabilize people's hearts, and must send more plainclothes detectives to inspect the Hongkou area on a daily rotating basis for protection. Director Fei promised to discuss with the Police Department again.</p>
<h3>All Japanese War Horses are Infected</h3>
<p>The Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun in this port reported that after the bridging company from Hokuriku, which was stationed in Liuhe Town, landed in Wusong, all of the company's more than 400 war horses are now infected with an epidemic, suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome, and are almost in a tragic situation of total annihilation. The captain is working tirelessly to take care of them. Currently, various materials are being collected from the army to build temporary stables, and the soldiers are also quite willing to guard the stables. Those with more serious illnesses are transported to the veterinary hospital of the military station for treatment. Four horses have died in recent days, so the caretakers are particularly anxious.</p>
<h3>False Alarm in South Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 2:00 PM, citizens in the area outside the Old West Gate of Zhonghua Road in South Shanghai suddenly panicked. The shops and residents there closed their doors one after another. The Second District General Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned of this and immediately sent patrol officers to investigate, but found nothing. After investigating in various places, it was learned that it was a rumor. The patrol officers then made announcements door to door, ordering them to open for business quickly, and order was restored shortly after.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Uses Explosives to Demolish Ancient Tomb</h3>
<p>At about 1:00 PM yesterday, a loud noise was suddenly heard in the Wusong area, and the sound shook far and wide. It was later found that the Japanese army behind the Huafeng Yarn Factory on the west side of Yunzaobang detonated explosives, because there was an ancient tomb in that location, located on the side of the road. The Japanese army believed that it hindered military visibility. Initially, it was planned to excavate and discard it, but because the tomb structure was very strong, explosives were used to demolish it instead.</p>
<h3>Ma Liang Represents at the National Crisis Conference</h3>
<p>Ma Xiangbo, a 93-year-old man, launched the Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Association after the September 18th Incident, encouraging the younger generation to strive to save the country from the national crisis. The government held a national crisis conference, and Mr. Ma was also invited to participate, advocating that the fundamental plan to save the country lies in abolishing party rule and implementing democracy. It was originally planned to send a joint telegram with Mr. Zhang Junzeng to express their opinions, but since his students, Mr. Xu, and others went to Luoyang, he specially instructed them to state their case on his behalf, and he has already set off yesterday.</p>
<h3>Du Xigui Went to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>Does Not Participate in the National Crisis Conference. Du Xigui, the Principal of the Mawei Naval Academy, rested in Shanghai for a day after arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and took the Jiangxin wheel to Beijing at 7:00 PM yesterday. It is reported that this trip to Beijing is to meet with his old friend Chairman Lin and to discuss with Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan. As for the National Crisis Conference, it is scheduled to be held in Luoyang tomorrow (i.e., today), but he is old and weak and has no expertise, and all the committee members are temporary elites who will be able to discuss and decide on a major plan to save the country, so he does not need to go to Luoyang to participate. After arriving in Beijing, he will stay for a while and then return to Fujian. The situation in Fujian is peaceful, and the Naval Academy is still teaching as usual.</p>
<h3>Northwest Correspondent Zhang Lianquan Returns to Shaanxi to Report</h3>
<p>To the National Crisis Council Members: Please Promote the Development of the Northwest.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Lianquan, a special envoy to the Northwest and representative for comforting the anti-Japanese armies in Shanghai, has come south to Shanghai. He is also tasked with representing the Northwest People's Livelihood Reclamation Company. After arriving in Shanghai, he immediately hired engineers Li Rongbin and Cheng Jiangchuan. As previously reported, Mr. Zhang, Mr. Li, and others have been working with the engineers in recent days to discuss various plans for building new villages and opening up transportation routes, and are busy drawing up designs. Yesterday, Mr. Hu Shuhua of the Industrial Society also came to discuss matters. Mr. Zhang is unwilling to elaborate much on the development of the Northwest. He believes that the first step should be to complete the actual work before announcing it to the public. By that time, land reclamation will have yielded results, and then he will welcome Chinese people to join in cooperation. Currently, he is determined to embody the spirit of sacrifice, doing more and talking less. Mr. Zhang also sent a letter to all members of the National Crisis Council, asking them to promote the development of the Northwest, advocating for the use of people's organizations and national power to protect and reward them, so that people's livelihood issues can be resolved and the country can become strong. Mr. Zhang is scheduled to depart for the Northwest today to report on his mission. Mr. Li Rongbin will be responsible for all matters in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Du Yuesheng Firmly Declines the Position of Chairman of the French Concession Ratepayers' Association</h3>
<p>Mr. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association, has firmly requested to resign. The Association convened an executive committee meeting yesterday and unanimously decided to retain him, and dispatched representatives to Mr. Du's residence to earnestly request him to continue in the position.</p>
<h3>Opinion on Rent Reduction and Exemption</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Requests Instructions from the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Since the invasion by the violent Japanese, citizens have been displaced and impoverished, with hundreds of thousands losing their livelihoods, greatly reducing their economic capacity. Some organized groups have requested rent reduction and exemption to alleviate the burden on citizens. The Bureau believes that this work is very important and has drafted an opinion on rent reduction and exemption, detailing it to the Municipal Government for instructions. Once instructions are received, detailed measures will be formulated and implemented in a practical manner, taking into account the interests of both landlords and tenants, approaching the facts to avoid impracticality.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Meeting of the General Tenants' Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Tenants' Association held its second committee meeting at 3 PM on the 4th, chaired by Cheng Kefan, to discuss the following matters:</p>
<p>(1) Letters from various neighborhoods requesting assistance (Resolved) To accept and actively proceed, and reply to inform.</p>
<p>(2) Measures for reorganizing the Association's affairs (Resolved) To dispatch personnel for strict organization. Once finalized, a meeting of member representatives will be convened on a scheduled date.</p>
<p>(3) How to handle the landlords' pressure to collect rent, given the unsettled situation and the slow recovery of businesses despite the opening of the market? (Resolved) Those who report to the Association will be responsible for negotiation. Solicit special opinions from each branch and organized groups, and report them to the Association for handling.</p>
<p>(4) [Incorrect numbering] (Resolved) Passed.</p>
<p>(5) The Association's registration of tenants and branches waives membership fees (Resolved) Based on the previous resolution, absolutely no membership fees will be collected from external parties.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding disputes between landlords and tenants in the future, during this special environment, request both courts to maintain the market conditions, not to handle them according to original customs, and to consider public opinion (Resolved) To proceed accordingly.</p>
<p>(7) Fang Jiaobo raised the issue of whether the property of charitable organizations should be excluded from rent reduction (Resolved) It is found that there are not a few charitable organizations, such as Catholic churches and Yu Ren Tang, within the city limits, which are also similar to commercial properties. This time, most of the tenants are affected, so they must be handled equally and not treated differently. Others omitted. Meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Shareholders' Meeting of Changxing Coal Mine Company</h3>
<p>The shareholders of Changxing Coal Mine Company requested the return of the mining property. The committee convened a general committee meeting yesterday, stating that it had been over four years since the mine was taken over by the Construction Committee. The fifth National People's Congress had already passed a resolution to return it, but the matter has been delayed until now due to the outstanding payments. It was found that the mine had been developed during commercial operations, but it suffered excessive losses due to the Qi-Lu War in 1924, which caused it to be suspended. It is not comparable to a case of business failure or inability to mine. The meeting unanimously resolved to request the Construction Committee to reduce the amount of the outstanding payment and allow repayment in installments, in order to restore the shareholders' rights and maintain commerce as soon as possible. Later, Chairman Liu Wanqing of the committee reported on the progress of the request, and said that Chairman Zhang Jingjiang of the Construction Committee, in consideration of the difficulties of the merchants, had expressed that the repayment of the outstanding payments could be handled leniently. Once the various repayment methods are finalized, the goal of a satisfactory recovery can be achieved soon.</p>
<h3>Remarks by the Standing Committee of the National Postal Workers' Union on the Increase in Postage Rates</h3>
<p>In view of the domestic floods and foreign aggression in recent years, which have caused significant losses to the postal service, and the postal economy being increasingly strained, the Ministry of Communications recently formulated measures to increase postage rates and implemented them immediately. Reporters from various newspapers specifically interviewed Mr. Zhang Kechang, a standing committee member of the National Postal Workers' Union, yesterday to inquire about the Union's opinion on the increase in postage rates. According to Mr. Zhang, the postal authorities believe that the increase in postage rates is a last resort to maintain the postal economy. Due to the domestic floods and unprecedented national disasters in recent years, various industries have been extremely depressed, and postal revenue has also decreased sharply, almost to the point of being unsustainable, so postal fees have been increased to provide funding. However, the Union believes that while an increase in postage rates is necessary, more attention should be paid to the implementation of austerity policies, such as: (1) The savings and remittance bureaus of redundant agencies should be immediately taken over and handled by the post office to save postal public funds. (2) The aviation industry run by the government should no longer extract postal revenue as operating capital. We do not oppose the aviation industry, but it must be funded separately by the government. If postal revenue is used for this kind of experiment, the enterprise may not see its development, and the postal service will be dragged down. Therefore, the Union hopes that the Ministry of Communications will not rely solely on increasing revenue for this increase in postage rates, but will also engage in reducing expenditure, such as the necessary implementation of the aforementioned austerity policies. Only then will the postal future be secured. Otherwise, the public will have increased burdens, but the postal service will not be improved. The Union has decided to make this suggestion to the Ministry of Communications. The news reported in various newspapers a few days ago, with the headline "Oppose the Increase in Postage Rates," slightly misunderstood the Union's opinion.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Workers' Group in West Shanghai Demands Effective Relief</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, the unemployed workers of various Japanese factories in West Shanghai have united, enthusiastically loved their country, sacrificed their livelihoods, and organized the Unemployed Workers' Group in West Shanghai. Due to the precariousness of their lives, they have repeatedly sent representatives to various social organizations and groups to request relief. The responsible social organizations, in view of this, have established the War Zone Unemployed Workers' Relief Association to provide relief. Registration has now begun in West Shanghai. The Unemployed Workers' Group is calling on workers to register and putting forward specific conditions to demand effective relief.</p>
<h3>Road Bureau Issued Salaries to Employees Yesterday</h3>
<p>The salaries for March of the employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways could not be issued on time due to the financial difficulties of the Road Bureau. The budget had to be extended to the 13th of this month before it could be approved. The employees of the two railways suffered direct and indirect losses in this Shanghai Incident, which had a significant impact. It was really impossible to delay the payment of salaries, and they petitioned the Road Bureau to sympathize with them and issue the salaries on time. Now, Chen Xinghan, the Director of the two Railway Administrations, has considered the actual situation and is urgently trying to raise funds. Starting yesterday, the funds will be allocated to the employees and police officers of each station on the two railways, and salaries will be issued to them by name.</p>

<p>Chief of the News Gathering Department of This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Kang Tongyi Passed Away Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Kang Tongyi, the Chief of the News Gathering Department of this newspaper, has served in this office for thirteen years. He was calm in nature and meticulous in his work. He has always possessed a talent for journalism. He was very attentive to office affairs, and regardless of the size of the matter, he personally took care of it. The relationship among all staff members was very harmonious. However, due to his inherent constitution, he had always suffered from chronic illnesses. During the recent Shanghai Incident, Mr. Kang worked day and night on the scheduling and gathering of news. His illness relapsed. After lying in bed for two days, it suddenly turned into peritonitis, and he passed away suddenly yesterday (the 6th) at 2 PM. When relatives and friends heard the news, they were all deeply grieved. Mr. Kang was forty years old, having served and retired twice. In his early years, he graduated from Nanyang Public School and then transferred to the North Kang Tongyi's Portrait</p>
<p>Ping Taxation Special School. After graduation, he worked at the Shanghai Customs for several years. Mr. Kang always had an interest in journalism. In 1920, he joined this newspaper and founded the News Gathering Department, planning everything. For more than ten years, he worked as if it was just one day. In the past, when the Lincheng Train Robbery occurred, Mr. Kang happened to be in the north on office business and was captured in the midst of the chaos. He used his quick wit to escape danger and rescued many victims. His composure in times of crisis can be seen from this incident. On the evening of the Mukden Incident last year, Mr. Kang was also in the provincial capital. Afterwards, he returned safely to the south. Unfortunately, the arduous journey caused him to cough up a lot of blood after returning to Shanghai, and it took several months of rest to recover. This time, he passed away unexpectedly due to accumulated fatigue. Mr. Kang was a loving husband and father. He is survived by six children, which is very sad. The funeral will be held at 3 PM today (the 7th) at the Universal Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. Mr. Kang had a wide circle of friends during his lifetime, and it is expected that there will be many mourners attending the funeral.</p>
<h3>19th Route Army Maintains Salt Transport</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai War, transportation has been difficult, resulting in a shortage of edible salt and soaring prices. The situation is even more difficult in the Su-Chang area. Recently, Zhang Hengchang and others, merchants from Su-Dang Town, jointly submitted a petition to the rear affairs office of the 19th Route Army, requesting that it be forwarded to the military headquarters, stating that all transport ships carrying official salt and bearing the official seal and flag of the Songjiang Salt Transport Office should be allowed to pass. The affairs office has obtained the approval of the headquarters and has decided to allow them to pass. The instruction states: "For the purpose of informing matters, the case was reviewed based on a previous petition from the merchants, stating that salt transport was obstructed and requesting that the military headquarters be instructed to order the military and police organs along the way to allow all official salt ships holding the Songjiang Transport Office's seal and flag to pass, or to issue passes to facilitate passage and maintain the supply of food for the people. The headquarters has now replied that all units have already been notified of the passage of flag salt ships in various places, and it is not necessary to issue passes again. It is hereby instructed to inform the merchants so that they may be informed."</p>
<h3>Anti-Drug Association's Declaration Against Opium Monopoly in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association announced that Fang Shengtao, the acting chairman of Fujian Province, colluded with the troops stationed in northern and southern Fujian, established a contraband inspection station, collected opium taxes, and implemented a monopoly. Although the association and all circles in Fujian Province have repeatedly opposed it, the authorities ignored everything and proceeded stubbornly. Yesterday, the association issued a special declaration to urge the people of the country to pay attention and jointly devise ways to deal with it. The telegram reads as follows: "Heaven is afflicting China, and sorrows are coming one after another. Demons and evils are arising. The opium issue has already caused great waves and been a recurring scourge. Previously, the opium monopoly advocated by Wu Liande caused temporary chaos. Fortunately, it was abolished by order of the Executive Yuan after the public and this association vowed to oppose it to the death. Now, the acting chairman of Fujian Province, Fang Shengtao, taking advantage of the current national crisis, with the enemy's attacks still ongoing and the people of the country focusing on external affairs, colluded with Chen Guohui, He Xianzhu, and others in Fujian Province to organize the so-called Provincial Defense Committee, established contraband inspection stations, issued opium stamps, collected opium taxes, and implemented a monopoly. Branch offices have already been established in downstream Fuxing, Zhangquan, Xiamen, and other places. The distribution of the funds from this tax is arranged as follows: In addition to the agency headed by so-and-so, 50,000 yuan is given to the navy, 30,000 yuan to the Liu Division, and 15,000 yuan to the Ministry of Finance. Each officer and rank has a share to avoid looting. The previous fact that the Fujian troops stationed there forced the planting of opium seedlings, which was widely publicized, has now advanced a step further to engage in inducing and forcing people to consume it. The policy of national suicide advocated by Wu has been concretely realized by Fang Shengtao and others. The hard work and determination of the entire nation in running around and shouting themselves hoarse to oppose it in the past has been easily erased by Fang Shengtao and others. For the sake of the pockets of a few warlords and the survival of bandit-style armies, they do not hesitate to trample on the 30 million people of the entire country. The harsh government has already been devastating enough in recent years, and now they are even embracing the policy of poisoning people for ten thousand years to further harm them. Although all circles in Fujian Province have vowed to oppose it to the death, all members of the Fujian Provincial Government, except for Fang, have jointly submitted their resignations to the central government and requested that personnel be sent to Fujian to investigate and deal with the matter. The committee members of the provincial party headquarters have also resigned with full force. However, Fang and others still do not care and are determined to implement the monopoly policy. This is the public evil of the world, the public harm of the people. What has Fujian Province done? It is just the place where it is happening. This Association has a responsibility to reject drugs and has no excuse to avoid it. Regardless of whether the person is a warlord or a powerful figure, they must be reasoned with and actively criticized. The opium monopoly situation in Fujian Province this time is particularly serious. If it is not stopped, the harm will be irreparable. This Association vows to devote its full power to deal with it. We hope that all compatriots will rise up and respond, creating a public opinion that will sanction the harm to the party and the nation. (Omission) Recently, Chen Diaoyuan, the chairman of Anhui Province, who monopolized opium, has been sanctioned by public opinion and removed from office. This shows that the public will is the center of politics. The same efforts should be made in Fujian to eliminate the scourge of drugs in its infancy. In addition to repeatedly requesting that the central government send personnel to investigate and deal with it, and sending personnel to Beijing to appeal, this Association is constantly planning active countermeasures. We urge all circles to provide assistance to strengthen our momentum. With the utmost gratitude, this is our declaration. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association."</p>

<p>The Shanghai War Zone Temporary Relief Association for Refugees has been dispatching rescue team members Wang Peinan, Wu Guirong, and others to carry out rescue work with all their might. It is reported that on the 4th and 5th of this month, the team members rescued refugees from the Huaxin Jing and Caojiadu areas, and 206 people were registered by the transfer section. After registration by the offices of various native place associations, 9 people were sent to Kou'an, 49 to Wuhu, 10 to Zhenjiang, 3 to Anqing, 14 to Nanjing, and 14 to Hankou. The rest were sent to the Danjing Temple, Binlang Road, and Yongqing Temple lodgings for proper accommodation.

Sixteen people have been sent to the Citizens' Federation, and the remaining two have been sent to the Yufosi Injured People's Hospital on Gordon Road for treatment.</p>
<h3>News from the Jisheng Association's Suzhou Accommodation Centers</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association in this city has established six refugee accommodation centers in Suzhou, which has already been reported in the newspapers. Now, due to the large number of refugees, they are not sufficient to accommodate them, so one more has been added, for a total of seven accommodation centers. The original two steamships, one motorboat, and several tugboats have been hired. Team leaders Ling Youguang, Qi Bingzhang, and Ding Guan are leading the team members to rescue refugees in different ways. There are now over two thousand refugees being accommodated in various centers in Suzhou. Refugees from various places are still coming in an endless stream. A large number of refugees have been accommodated in the various centers in this city. Now, with the addition of seven accommodation centers in Suzhou, the number of refugees is increasing day by day, and the expenses are enormous, which goes without saying. Under such circumstances, it is not easy to support it. It is hoped that compassionate compatriots at home and abroad and generous gentlemen will understand and help each other to save lives.</p>
<h3>News of Rescue by the Seventh Team of the Red Cross</h3>
<p>The Seventh Rescue Team of the Chinese Red Cross, after our army left the Shanghai area and changed its strategy, moved from Zhenru to Suzhou, and then from Suzhou to Kunshan. Time flies, and a month has passed. During this month, the rescue mission has not involved many wounded soldiers due to strategic considerations. However, part of the team set up a hospital in Suzhou to accommodate and supplement the rear area, and part of the team went to Kunshan for rescue to ensure that the front and rear areas were connected. The staff members have also been able to maintain their spirit of sacrifice, unity, and perseverance throughout, which is particularly commendable. Team leader Guo Qiyuan, in order to maintain the historical record and continue the spirit of the future, specifically convened a meeting of all staff members at 9 AM on the day before yesterday (the 1st), commended each staff member for their past efforts, and encouraged them to work hard in the future. He also gave instructions on the handling of affairs in each team division so that the staff members would have something to follow.</p>
<h3>Pushan Villa Buries a Large Number of Corpses</h3>

<h3>Nanyang Tobacco Company Female Workers Drown, Seeking Compensation Negotiations</h3>
<p>Chuan Qinghuai Emerges to Mediate...Hopes for a Satisfactory Resolution</p>
<p>At approximately 7:00 PM on the 39th day of last month, a portion of the female workers from the Nanyang Tobacco Company in Hongkou, residing in Pudong, boarded a ferry at the Zhaofeng Wharf to return home across the river. Upon reaching the center of the river, the ferry was suddenly struck by the Customs' Jingguang launch in the darkness, resulting in the drowning of over thirty female workers. Subsequently, the bereaved families jointly organized a family association, making separate demands to both the Customs authorities and the Nanyang Company for compensation. After several unsuccessful negotiations, the situation was previously reported in detail. It is now learned that Mr. Chuan Qinghuai, a youth association worker who recently returned from studying in the United States, has been mediating between the Customs and Nanyang for several days in a private capacity, and has also advised the family association not to take excessively radical actions. Therefore, the situation on all three sides (i.e., Customs, Nanyang, and the family association) is much closer than before. The Nanyang Company informed the bereaved families yesterday to first collect the deceased's pre-mortem wages in order to further the process towards a satisfactory outcome. Judging from this situation, it is hoped that this case can be resolved in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Automobile Industry Requests Reduction or Exemption of License Fees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Automobile Industry Association yesterday submitted a request to the Public Utilities Bureau for a reduction or exemption of automobile license fees for the spring and summer seasons. The submission reads: "Request for reduction or exemption of automobile license fees. Our association members, including Lili, Xiangsheng, Xinzha, Meihua, Dahua, Dalong, Yitai, Huisi, Huishan, Far East, Huali, China Moving Company, etc., totaling seventy-seven companies, jointly state in a letter: 'Since the beginning of the Japanese invasion of Zhabei, the industry in the Hongkou area immediately suspended business. Although the industry within the French Concession and the central part of the International Settlement was able to maintain transportation, its service was limited by areas that could not be reached. The corner of the Nanshi area is also experiencing tense situation, and few vehicles are operating. However, our members have complied with the regulations of the Public Utilities Bureau, fully paid the fees, and obtained licenses, but have not been able to fully utilize them. Furthermore, due to the impact of the war, all members have suffered losses, resulting in economic difficulties. Therefore, we respectfully request that your association forward this to the Public Utilities Bureau for a discretionary reduction of the spring vehicle fee to alleviate the hardships of businesses.' In view of the above, since the Shanghai Incident occurred and the area became a war zone, our industry previously paid fees to your bureau in accordance with regulations to obtain spring licenses. However, the driving locations could not be used within the originally designated area. As the summer fees are due soon, the area is still difficult to recover. Moreover, since being affected, our economy has been exhausted, and we are in dire straits. Observing the business situation, it is indeed worthy of consideration. Seeing this situation, our association should request your bureau to consider the situation and reasonably reduce or exempt the spring and summer vehicle license fees to ensure fairness and maintain business. We respectfully request approval and instructions. This is a great convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau."</p>
<h3>Visitors on Longhua Road Like Snowflakes</h3>
<p>Public Buses Add Extra Service. The weather has been warm in recent days, and the Qingming Festival has arrived. Along Longhua Road, the green willows and red peach blossoms are luxuriant, with the beauty of spring undiminished by the impact of the war. Consequently, men and women on suburban outings come and go like clouds. Moreover, the general public believes that the invasion by the Japanese this time, the area of South Shanghai, has not been ravaged, saying that it is due to the silent protection of our Buddha, who spared us from the catastrophe. Therefore, in recent days, those going to Longhua Temple to burn incense and worship Buddha have followed one after another, and the bustling situation along the way is even more prevalent than in previous years. Now, in order to meet the needs of tourists and pilgrims, the Shanghai South Public Bus Company has specially increased the number of buses on Route 2 from Ximen to Longhua starting today, to facilitate transportation.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption of Vehicle Fees in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Recounting the Brutality of the Japanese Army for Several Days...Exempting Supplementary Fees for February and March. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Public Utilities and Finance Bureaus, requesting exemption of vehicle fees for businesses in Zhabei for February and March. The original letter states: "Respectfully informing you, on the 6th of this month, according to Zhou Jinting, Che Lisheng, and other members of the Zhabei disaster relief committee of the Shanghai Human-Powered Vehicle Industry Association, regarding the Japanese army invading Shanghai, harming vehicle businesses, requesting transfer to the Finance and Public Utilities Bureaus for relief matters. Due to the Japanese army's barbarity, occupying our Zhabei territory and hindering transportation, the association headquarters was temporarily relocated to prepare for vehicle business registration and facilitate office work, which has already been reported and filed, and need not be reported again. It is noted that few vehicle businesses in Zhabei have registered with the association as victims. The association has sent personnel to investigate in four locations within the war zone, but it is difficult to determine the exact number. It is claimed that many vehicles in Hongkou have been dragged by the Japanese army to Dachang, Nanxiang, and other places, and many vehicles have also been burned by the Japanese army and residents. Although the investigators saw it, they dared not speak, and if they inquired, they were often beaten. It is universally known that the Japanese army does not allow Chinese people freedom of movement within the occupied area. Since the January 28th Incident, it has been over two months. Alas, some of our vehicle businesses have no home to return to, and some have homes but cannot return. The detailed number of population and vehicle losses cannot be investigated at this time. Only a small number of vehicle businesses who escaped have lost all their property and have no means of livelihood. How can we bear to ask them to pay the supplementary fees for the previous two months when they are in urgent need and facing difficulties? Therefore, we respectfully request your association to grant approval and beg the Finance and Public Utilities Bureaus to consider the suffering and provide relief to the businesses, exempting them from paying the supplementary fees for February and March, and also allowing them to pay the license fees for this month in succession to temporarily alleviate the lives of the distressed businesses." In view of this, it is noted that Zhabei has suffered greatly from the war, and the market has become ruins. Although the war has ceased, it is still occupied by Japanese soldiers, and the area is a scorched earth with no sign of human habitation. It is natural that the vehicle businesses cannot continue to operate. If they are required to pay the supplementary fees for February and March at this time, it is indeed impossible. Correspondingly, we respectfully request your bureau to investigate and approve the exemption of the vehicle fees in Zhabei for February and March to show compassion and deep gratitude."</p>
<h3>Navigation Administration Bureau's Zhejiang Offices Continue to Operate as Usual</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan Resolves to Revoke the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Resolution. According to the China East News Agency, the Ministry of Communications, in order to develop shipping and unify navigation administration, followed the central government's promulgation of the Navigation Administration Bureau's organizational law. Last July, the Navigation Administration Bureau was established in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Harbin, and other places. Due to taking over the work of measuring and inspecting ships on behalf of various customs houses, branch offices of the Navigation Administration Bureau were selectively established. Its powers have been clearly defined by law, and no organization may violate or exceed them. However, last month, shipowners in Zhejiang Province complained that they were required to apply for inspection and registration with the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications in accordance with the law, and also pay license taxes to the Ship Office established by the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, resulting in overlapping burdens and complicated procedures, which led to a mass protest. The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in violation of central government laws, allocated the ships that should have been registered with the Navigation Administration Bureau to be handled by the province, and even resolved in a provincial government meeting to order local governments in various counties and cities to forcibly stop the legal registration of the Navigation Administration Bureau's branch offices, attempting to change the laws promulgated by the central government with the orders of the provincial government. This directly disrupted the administrative system and violated legal rights. The Ministry of Communications considered this to be a violation of laws and exceeding authority, and submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan in accordance with the law, requesting the revocation of this conflicting order. The Executive Yuan has already resolved this matter at its 14th meeting, ordering the Zhejiang Provincial Government to comply and separately instructing the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau to inform the Navigation Administration Bureau. The Navigation Administration Bureau, after receiving the order, yesterday separately instructed the various branch offices in Zhejiang Province to take note.</p>
<h3>Election of the Public Works Department's Land Committee</h3>
<p>According to Article 6, paragraph B of the Public Real Estate Regulations of the International Settlement, three real estate committee members should be appointed each year within the settlement. One is appointed by the Public Works Department, one is elected by registered landlords within the settlement during the election of directors, and one is elected by the taxpayers' annual meeting. This year, the committee member to be appointed by the Public Works Department has been continued to be Mr. Berents by the Public Works Department. The person to be elected by the landlords has been elected as Mr. G. L. Wilson (Mr. N. L. Sparke, the former one, is currently on leave to return to his home country). Three candidates have been nominated for the one to be elected by the taxpayers' annual meeting (Mr. H. G. FRobinson, whose term has expired, has retired), as follows: Mr. J. T. W. Brooke, proposed by Mr. C. M. Bain, seconded by Mr. A. G. Dovey; Mr. S. H. Peek, proposed by Mr. Calder Marshall, seconded by Mr. H. Wakela; Mr. Wr. H. F. Rofiusou, proposed by Mr. G. H. Mnght, seconded by Mr. K. E. Newman.</p>
<h3>Director Mai Dismisses Chang Yuqing as Instructor</h3>
<p>Mai Zhaoshu, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, dismissed Chang Yuqing, an instructor at the Dockworkers Unemployment Relief Association, for dereliction of duty. The original order is recorded below: "Order to Comply. It has recently been reliably reported that Chang Yuqing, an instructor at the association, has twice failed to attend relief meetings. The position of instructor at the association is hereby revoked. It is urgently ordered that you comply. It is still hoped that you will continue your efforts to handle relief matters. This order."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Soliciting Shirts and Trousers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to all sectors of society for soliciting shirts, trousers, and other supplies. Since the opening of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire conference, the Japanese army has not only shown no sincerity but has also increased its troops on the front lines, deliberately provoking. In the event that the conference breaks down and the Japanese side reopens hostilities, our army will have no choice but to continue to resist and defend properly. The army urgently needs shirts, trousers, shoes, water bottles, military blankets, raincoats, and other supplies, especially shirts and trousers, which are daily necessities. If we want to prepare them immediately, it will take a lot of time. We sincerely hope that all compatriots and patriots across the country will share the same hatred for the enemy and sacrifice their families to help the country, actively donate, and the more the better. The collection point is the Office for Collecting Comfort Items at the Tianhougong Bridge Wood Association.</p>

One thief drew a pistol from his sleeve, and another thief rolled up a book and held it, pretending to be a pistol, prohibiting Yao and others from making a sound. They then broke into the room and ransacked it. Suddenly, one of the diners shouted for help, and the sound was heard outside.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Le Pei. His surname is Hu, and his given name is Lifu. He is a small merchant broker who has never been outstanding. Recently, he saw in your newspaper that Hu Lifu, etc., of Zhabei organized the so-called Beishi Local Maintenance Association, which led many friends to question him. The three characters of Hu Lifu do not seem to be a personal patented trademark and belong to someone else. I dare to borrow a few lines from your newspaper to clear up the doubts of my friends. Respectfully to the editor of the Shenbao. Hu Lifu, Jiuhua Silk Satin Shop, April 6.</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor of the Shenbao, yesterday I read a report in your newspaper about a fire alarm at our association on Sichuan Road, which is far from the truth. On the night of the 4th, a three-story kitchen was cooking dishes, and the stove was close to the north window. Because the fire was fierce, sparks shot out and landed on the window paper. It was late at night, and passersby in the darkness mistakenly thought it was a fire alarm and immediately called the fire engine. It took no more than a few minutes before and after. After the report was published in the newspaper, members have been coming to ask questions for days. Please publish the letter as it is to dispel doubts. Greetings to the esteemed editor of the Shenbao, Shanghai Chinese Christian Youth Association, April 6.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>League of Nations Inquiry Team Travels East from Hankou by Ship</h3>
<p>They Will Transfer to a Train North Upon Arriving in Shanghai; Central Government Sends Personnel to the Port to Greet Them (Hankou) The inquiry team boarded the "Longhe" ship at 9 p.m. on the 5th to travel east. He Chengjun, Xia Douyin, and others boarded the ship to see them off. The Jiang'an area was heavily guarded. (Special dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Lord Lytton met with representatives from the business community and asked questions that were seriously probing. For example, he asked: 1. What methods are used to resist Japanese goods? 2. After the Sino-Japanese dispute is resolved, can the anti-foreign sentiment be eliminated? 3. How has the Manchurian Incident affected Hankou's commerce? He Hengfu replied: 1. After 1918, Chinese people considered it a great disgrace to recognize Japanese goods. 2. The resistance to Japanese goods is a result of the Japanese occupation of Manchuria and is not anti-foreignism. 3. Hankou's commerce has suffered enormous losses. His speech lasted the longest. (Special dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) When Lord Lytton met with representatives from the labor community, Lytton asked Wang Jinxia for his opinion on Sino-Japanese negotiations. Wang stated four points: 1. The Manchurian and Shanghai incidents are part of Japan's overall strategy to invade China. He hopes the League of Nations will not separate the two issues. 2. He hopes the League of Nations will urge Japan to withdraw its troops and impose sanctions on Japan based on Articles 15 and 16. 3.

<h3>Submitting Resignation as President of the Examination Yuan</h3>
<p>If Not Approved, Please Confirm the Vice-President (Nanjing) Dai Jitao submitted a request to the Central Government and the National Government on the 6th, earnestly requesting approval to resign as the President of the Examination Yuan. He stated that if we want to follow the model of national construction of the Premier Sun Yat-sen today, and implement the constitution to rectify all kinds of administrative systems, then examination and personnel management are important plans. Therefore, firstly, the government and the people must be determined to respect the Premier’s Five-Power Constitution. Secondly, the responsible officials must be able to earnestly take responsibility for creating and promoting work. Thirdly, the personnel of the agencies must engage in scholarship and work. He has been an official for two years, but has not seen any results. Reviewing the past, he feels that he has no way to repay the country and is ashamed of his position. Therefore, he still hopes that the Central Government will allow him to retire to recuperate and study, so that he can plan to serve the country again in the future. If it is absolutely necessary to continue his service, he can only ask to have the Vice-President quickly confirmed, so that they can take office at the same time and share the responsibilities. (Special dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter visited Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, on the 6th to inquire about various matters. He was kind enough to answer questions regarding the resolution of his personal career issues, his years of service to the central government, his future opinions on reforming key examination policies, and his aspirations for this trip to Luoyang. He said that after resigning and returning to his hometown last December, he was hospitalized in Wuxing Hospital for about three weeks. However, his neuralgia and stomach problems could not be cured in a short time. Regarding his position as President of the Examination Yuan, his resignation was not approved, but all administrative matters related to examination and personnel management could not be interrupted for a day. He came to Nanjing this time to solve this problem. He has been serving in the central government since 1925, which is now six years. He asked the central government to allow him to resign no matter what, so that he could recuperate with peace of mind and so that the central government could have more new people to do things. If the central government would not allow him to resign, then he asked the central government to allow him to take a long-term vacation, and the Vice-President would take full responsibility for presiding over the affairs of the Yuan. As for all the organizations of the Examination Yuan and the ministry, there have been various discussions in recent times. He dares to say that political construction is not a magic trick. It is not something that can be accomplished in one or two days or one or two years to complete a system. Nor is it possible for a single agency to complete an administrative task. If you do not seek truth from facts and engage in construction, but only focus on preparing systems, changing this way today and changing that way tomorrow, the result will be that the administrative system will become a revolving lantern, and there will be no good results. Moreover, examination and personnel management are two fundamental national systems and should not be easily abolished. As for the improvement of the examination administration, he has already expressed his opinions. Regarding the personnel system, he hopes that the personnel system can be established and implemented and that the method can be as perfect and reasonable as possible. Regarding the future improvement of all organizations of the Examination Yuan, he hopes that it will be practical and not superficial. He hopes that there will be officials who are able to do things practically, and he hopes that everyone will know to start by learning and working hard. As for his intention to go to Luoyang this time, firstly, he has not been to Luoyang since the government suffered the national humiliation, and he really wants to go. Secondly, Luoyang and Chang'an are places where he has always remembered the tombs and various relics of the sages of past dynasties in his homeland, and he always wants to go on a pilgrimage. He heard that many historical sites have been damaged and he also wants to do his best to repair and reorganize them. Therefore, after arriving in Luoyang, he plans to go to Chang'an. If circumstances permit, he also plans to go to Lanzhou and then to Qinghai to visit the hometown of Grand Master Tsongkhapa. As for the National Crisis Conference, he has nothing to contribute. Since last winter, colleagues in Beijing have started to build the Renwang Protecting the Country Dharma Assembly and made ten vows. He sincerely hopes that everyone at the National Crisis Conference will make these ten vows together, and the national crisis will naturally be saved. Things that are reasonable in the world will surely succeed. The Three Principles of the People is the only way to save the country. If everyone truly believes in it and practices it, the Republic of China will surely prosper, and there is no reason to decline. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 6th)</p>

<h3>Opening of the Four-Power Conference of England, France, Germany, and Italy</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister MacDonald Chairs Meeting to Discuss Economic Issues of the Danube River.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 6th: German Deputy Foreign Minister Pulo, along with the German delegation attending the Four-Power Conference, arrived in Liverpool at 8:04 this morning.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Grandi and the Italian delegation arrived at Victoria Station last night.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th: With the arrival of Italian Foreign Minister Grandi in London, the delegation attending the Four-Power Conference is now complete. All matters have been prepared in detail for a thorough discussion of the economic issues of the Danube countries. The conference is scheduled to open at the British Foreign Office at 2:30 PM today, chaired by British Prime Minister MacDonald. It is hoped that the conference will conclude its discussions by the end of this week, as the Geneva Disarmament Conference is scheduled to resume next Monday. The immediate goal of the Four-Power Conference is to agree on a preferential tariff rate and loans to prevent the bankruptcy and trade stagnation of the Danube countries. England, France, and the United States have made significant investments in the Danube region. It is said that England alone has invested as much as £200 million. Maintaining the countries on the verge of bankruptcy is not only a matter of humanity, but also an essential measure from a purely business perspective, so that billions of funds are not lost. Italy and Germany both purchase large quantities of products from the Danube countries and therefore strongly desire to join the economic alliance. However, France and its affiliated Little Entente countries (i.e., Yugoslavia and Romania) strongly oppose the entry of Germany and Italy, fearing that these two major powers will control the smaller countries. In any case, France views Germany's joining the alliance as no different from the German-Austrian customs union plan that France broke up last year.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th: The Four-Power Conference of England, France, Germany, and Italy, considering the turbulent situation in the Danube countries, will convene at the Foreign Office this afternoon. It is expected that this meeting will be informal and of a preparatory nature. A more important meeting with representatives of the Danube countries will be held later. Italian Foreign Minister Grandi met with British Prime Minister MacDonald this morning. Subsequently, the Cabinet held a meeting to discuss the main points of contention in the conference. After the meeting, the British Prime Minister hosted a banquet for the representatives at his residence on Downing Street, attended by government officials.</p>
<h3>Stimson Goes to Europe with an Important Mission</h3>
<p>Seeking a Solution to World Peace and Facilitating the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 5th: President Hoover declared that the economic burden on various countries has increased unabated in recent months, and the threat to world peace is also increasing daily. Stimson is going to Geneva in the hope of working together to find a peaceful solution and participating in the Disarmament Conference at the same time.</p>
<p>National, Washington, 5th: US President Hoover stated today that he requested Secretary of State Stimson to go to Geneva solely to promote more practical steps in world disarmament. He solemnly stated that Stimson will not discuss war debt issues in Europe. According to this statement by President Hoover, news from Europe believes that Stimson's trip may be initiated by the United States discussing the war debt issue. Currently, the political circles here believe that from an international perspective, discussing the war debt issue is extremely urgent, but from the standpoint of US domestic policy, the US government should not raise this issue at this time.</p>
<h3>Cabinet Forced to Resign</h3>
<p>National, St. John's (Newfoundland), 5th: Today, thousands of people shouted slogans demanding the resignation of the cabinet and tried to break into the parliament. They forced back the police guarding the vicinity of the parliament. During the disturbance, many government agencies were destroyed, and five police officers and more than twenty civilians were injured. The Prime Minister of Newfoundland tried to escape in the chaos but was tied up by the rioters and dragged into a muddy ditch. He was finally rescued by a clergyman and taken elsewhere. Other officials either escaped in the chaos or were trapped in the parliament overnight, fearing being beaten if they went outside. Currently, the crowd outside the parliament has increased to 25,000 people, shouting slogans demanding the resignation of the cabinet non-stop.</p>
<p>Reuters, Capital of Newfoundland, 5th: The British Newfoundland government has now resigned. When former Finance Minister Cushing resigned in February, he accused the Prime Minister of Newfoundland and other cabinet members of misappropriating public funds. The opposition party then requested a government audit by parliament, which the government refused, causing great public anger. Today, crowds gathered outside the House of Assembly, smashing doors and windows and demanding an audit. The Prime Minister was trapped in the House of Assembly, and reluctantly announced his resignation.</p>
<h3>Franco-German Anti-Japanese Movement Not Strong</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 5th: Communist Party members demonstrated in West Berlin today, shouting slogans to overthrow the Japanese warlords who are destroying peace, and broke into two Japanese-owned taverns. Doors, windows, and equipment were all destroyed. German police rushed to suppress the riot upon hearing the news, but the rioters had already escaped.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 6th: Today, many demonstrators threw stones at the display windows of two Japanese restaurants and distributed leaflets with the words "Down with the Japanese, the culprits of war." The demonstrators also advised the public not to go to Japanese restaurants. The leader of the demonstrators escaped. It is believed that this was an action by the Communist Party.</p>

<h3>Japanese Seize Customs Duties in the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>British Labour MP Raises Questions in the House of Commons</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: Labour MP Morgan Jones asked in the House of Commons today about the telegram sent by the Nanjing government to the League of Nations in Geneva, stating that the Japanese intend to seize the customs duties of the Three Eastern Provinces and hand them over to the Manchurian government, and that the appointment of customs officials must be notified to the new government. The collected customs duties can be used to offset the Boxer Indemnity and foreign debts secured by the customs duties of the Eastern Provinces, but cannot be used to offset domestic debts. The Japanese management of customs will close off the Eastern Provinces, affecting not only foreign trade, but also isolating China's domestic trade. The Japanese also want to sign a customs union with the Eastern Provinces, which would mean that the Eastern Provinces would no longer belong to China and would be subordinate to Japan. Eden replied that he had seen the telegram, but had not yet received any information from other sources regarding whether Japan actually intends to take this action.</p>
<h3>Soviet Authorities Urge Trotsky to Return Home</h3>
<p>National, Constantinople, 5th: According to reliable reports, Soviet authorities are currently trying to urge Trotsky to return to Russia. It is said that Soviet leader Stalin has instructed one of his close friends to persuade Trotsky to return. Although Stalin and Trotsky are political enemies, given the current dangerous situation, Stalin and other Soviet leaders feel that if Trotsky can return home, it will greatly increase the power of the Soviet Union. Stalin also wants to find a way to ensure Trotsky's safe return.</p>
<h3>Deputy President of South Manchuria Railway to be Replaced</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 6th: Eguchi, the Deputy President of the South Manchuria Railway, has resigned. The government will ask the Emperor to appoint Hatta in his place within days.

<h3>League of Nations Investigating Team Arrives in Hankou</h3>
<p>Further Details on the Longhe Steamer: After dinner on the 2nd, the Longhe Steamer arrived in Anqing. In the darkness, only the lights along the river were visible. The shipowner frequently used a searchlight to illuminate the Wangjiang Pagoda, so that Sir Lytton and others could see the scenery on the shore, as if this were Anqing's special feature. Upon reaching the Sanbei Wharf, an extremely large English banner hung above it, reading "Welcome Peace Envoys, League of Nations Investigating Team". At the China Merchants Wharf, military music was played from afar to welcome them.</p>
<p>With nothing to do at night, Chinese and Westerners played cards and mahjong for entertainment.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 3rd, as the ship was about to arrive in Jiujiang, all the team members had breakfast early. After the ship dropped anchor, the garrison commander Guo, County Magistrate Jiang Yi, Xiao Mian of the County Chamber of Commerce, Cheng Shunyuan of the banking sector, Xiong Xiangxu of the education sector, and Liu Anyuan of the Party Rectification Committee, and others representing different sectors boarded the ship to welcome them. The League of Nations Investigating Team disembarked at the No. 1 Wharf in Hankou.</p>
<p>Five boys and girls from the provincial No. 4 Middle School Experimental Elementary School presented flowers. They then disembarked and rested briefly at the Guomin Hotel, before walking along Binjiang Road (the former British concession) and Dazhong Road to the Zhenxing Museum. Because the museum was built on the shore of Gantang Lake, the scenery was pleasant. Nearby were landmarks such as the Yan Yu Tower and Nengren Temple, and in the distance was Mount Lu, all within view. Lunch had been prepared, but as the ship was scheduled to depart at 11:00, it was changed to refreshments. County Magistrate Jiang Yi delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the county, roughly saying that the Chinese people have always loved peace and only take self-defense actions when absolutely necessary. We trust the League of Nations and know that it is an organization that upholds peace and advocates justice, sufficient to resolve all Sino-Japanese disputes. Today, the invasion and occupation of the three northeastern provinces is truly a destruction of world peace. Your visit will surely lead to a fair judgment based on on-the-ground investigations. If our wishes are not fulfilled, we would rather sacrifice for justice and peace. Sir Lytton replied, though not accustomed to hearing speeches in the morning, the sincerity of your welcome and the children's flower offerings are unforgettable. We will strive to fulfill your hopes and hope for permanent peace between China and Japan, and further hope that the peoples of China and Japan will cooperate with us. Next, Commander Guo delivered congratulations on behalf of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and then departed. They walked along Kuanglu Road to the Memorial Monument for the Fallen Soldiers of the Fifth Division, took a brief tour, and then returned to the ship by car. Representatives from all sectors still saw them off at the wharf, and presented each member of the investigation team with a vase and scenic postcards of Mount Lu as souvenirs. On that day, flags were hung and music was played along the river, and students and Boy Scouts lined up to welcome and see them off. Sir Lytton and others seemed quite pleased.</p>
<p>Although Jiujiang is a commercial port in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the city is not thriving and there is nothing worth seeing. Upon entering the streets, one is assaulted by a foul and fishy smell. Wherever the investigation team went, they were given a bad impression. This was due to the lack of attention to daily administration and the inadequate preparation on a temporary basis.</p>
<p>Zhou Zechun, Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs Inspection in Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan, came from Wuhan to Xunyang on behalf of the Pacification Commissioner of Hubei and the Provincial Government to welcome them. Regarding the planned reception arrangements, he said that on the morning of the 4th, they would pay a visit to Pacification Commissioner He and Provincial Chairman Xia, and the Municipal Government would host a luncheon. In the afternoon, they would hold talks with representatives from all sectors for one hour and attend a tea party hosted by Western merchants in Hankou. Commissioner He would host a banquet in the evening. On the morning of the 5th, they would hold talks with representatives from all sectors for two hours and inspect the dike project. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce would host a luncheon. In the afternoon, they would cross the river to visit Wuhan University and attend a tea party. The Deming, Central, and Pacific Hotels were rented out for the investigation team and representatives to rest onshore. At 7:30, they would return to the ship. The banks along the river were mostly bare hills. What one saw was either ancient cities or small villages. Only the tall chimneys of Daye stood out, and the factories stretched out, showing a unique vitality. But it is a pity that they were operated by the Japanese. We have treasures, but we do not know how to develop them, and instead, others are developing them for us. Alas!</p>
<p>The ship arrived in Hankou at exactly 8:00 a.m. on the 4th. Pacification Commissioner He Chengjun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government Xia Douyin, Mayor He Baohua, Naval Commander Zeng Yiding, and others boarded the ship to welcome them. Sir Lytton was accompanied by Gu Weijun, Earl Lytton was accompanied by Wang Guangqi, General Claud was accompanied by Zhang Fu, Major General McCoy was accompanied by Yan Deqing, Dr. Heaney was accompanied by Xiao Jixue, Ambassador Yoshida was accompanied by Yan Enji, and Haas was accompanied by Zhang Xianglin. They disembarked to the sound of military music.</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondent: The League of Nations Investigating Team arrived in Hankou on the Longhe Steamer on the 1st of this month from Nanjing, to inspect the disaster areas. They passed Anqing on the 2nd, Jiujiang on the 3rd, and arrived in Hankou at 8:00 a.m. on the 4th. The welcome here was extremely warm. The details of the first day of the team's stay in Hankou are recorded below:</p>
<p>Grand Arrival in Hankou: The Welcome Preparatory Committee received a telegram from the Pacification Commissioner He Chengjun when the League of Nations Investigating Team arrived in Huangzhou. He then notified all welcoming representatives and receptionists on the evening of the 3rd to gather at the riverbank at 6:00 a.m. on the 4th to greet them. At that time, the Jianghan Customs Wharf, the Pacification Commissioner's Office, the Provincial Government, the Municipal Government, and the Garrison Department had all erected welcome arches. The Yong Sui warship stationed in Hankou, various organizations, shops, and residents all hung national flags and welcome slogans, which were all over the city. Pacification Commissioner He Chengjun, Chairman of the Provincial Government Xia Douyin, Mayor of Hankou He Baohua, Naval Commander Zeng Yiding, Captain Yan of the Yong Sui warship, and committee members of the provincial and municipal party departments, directors of various departments, and representatives from all sectors, about a thousand people, along with about ten thousand people from the public who welcomed them, a company of the Garrison Force, a platoon of the Naval Infantry, and a team of the Security Force, were responsible for security. The ceremonial guard of the 10th Army was responsible for playing music. At about 8:00 a.m., the Longhe Steamer arrived at the port and docked at the Yihe Wharf. For a time, music played in competition and cheers thundered, but the order was extremely solemn. He Chengjun, Xia Douyin, He Baohua, Zeng Yiding, and receptionists Xu Weirong, Wang Chongyou, Xie Fencheng, Li Shaohan, Zhou Zhongqi, He Yiyan, Li Zufin, Zhou Zechun, Luo Huiqiao, Li Boren, Chen Xuetao, Cai Licheng, and others, and the Consuls General of Britain, America, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan stationed in Hankou, numbering over twenty people, boarded the ship to greet them. Representative Gu Weijun introduced them one by one, and they shook hands with each other. They then disembarked together and took cars to the Deming Hotel to rest. The first car was for Sir Lytton, Chairman of the Investigation Team, and Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative. Mr. Lytton frequently nodded and smiled at the welcomers. The second car was for Earl Lytton and Wang Guangqi, Secretary-General of the Chinese delegation. The third car was for General Claud and Zhu Fengqian, Chinese Councilor. The fourth car was for General McCoy and Yan Deqing, Chinese Councilor. The fifth car was for Heaney. The sixth car was for Ambassador Yoshida, the Japanese representative, and Yan Enxiang, the Chinese reception director. The seventh car was for Secretary-General Haas and Zhang Xianglin, the Chinese Director of General Affairs. All went to the Deming Hotel.</p>

<p>Itinerary in Hankou: After the team arrived in Hankou, due to the short time, the originally scheduled reception program was repeatedly changed. Finally, it was decided that they would rest on the morning of the 4th at 8:00 a.m. At 11:00 a.m., they would visit the Pacification Commissioner, the Garrison Commander, and submit their cards to the Municipal Government. At 12:00 noon, they would attend the banquet hosted by Mayor He Baohua. At 4:00 p.m., they would go to the Western Merchants Association for a tea party. At 8:00 p.m., they would attend the banquet hosted by Pacification Commissioner He Chengjun. After the banquet, they would rest. On the morning of the 5th, from 9:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., they would meet with representatives from the business community. From 9:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., they would meet with representatives from the press. From 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., they would meet with representatives from the academic community. From 10:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., they would meet with representatives from the labor community and the Party headquarters. At 12:00 noon, they would inspect the Zhanggong Dike and the disaster relief shelters. In the afternoon, they would cross the river to visit Wuhan University on Luojia Mountain and inspect the Wutai Gate levee. They also planned to visit the Yellow Crane Tower. At 7:30 p.m., they would return to Hankou and board the Longhe Steamer to return to Nanjing in the east. Due to the hasty schedule, they indicated that they could not attend the banquet of the Chamber of Commerce. However, the Chamber of Commerce has now prepared a report to present everything in writing. As for the banquet of the Chairman of the Provincial Government, it will not be held as Xia Douyin has not yet taken office. As for the team's residence, the reception office had booked the Deming Hotel, the Central Hotel, and the Pacific Hotel in the French Concession in advance, allowing them to choose for themselves. However, most of the representatives wanted to stay on the ship. The British representative, Lytton, and the Italian representative, Maccardi, stayed at the British and Italian consulates respectively. The Japanese delegation stayed at the Pacific Hotel. The German, American, and French representatives also stayed at the consulates or remained on the ship. Attendants, secretaries, and the Chinese delegation all stayed on the ship.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Banquet: Mayor He Baohua held a banquet for the team at noon at the Puhaichun Western Restaurant. Because the representatives arrived late, they did not take their seats until after 1:00 p.m. Chairman He rose after three rounds of drinks and delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Chairman and distinguished members, due to the Sino-Japanese incident, you have been entrusted with the mission of the League of Nations to travel across the ocean, sparing no effort. On behalf of the 800,000 citizens of this city, the Mayor expresses a very sincere welcome. Hankou is located in the middle of the Yangtze River, with convenient transportation by boat and car, and is very closely related to the commerce of various countries. Since the unprecedented flood that occurred last July, many buildings in the city have been destroyed, causing great losses to Chinese and foreign commerce. By September 19th, the water began to recede. Major Chinese and foreign philanthropists are working hard to relieve the disaster victims, and the people of the city are striving to restore the business community. Unexpectedly, the East Province Incident occurred suddenly on September 18th, and the Shanghai Incident followed one after another. The people of the city all felt a great impact. Therefore, all construction plans in the city have not been able to proceed as desired, and the situation in the city is even more simple and crude. In addition, our Chinese nation, nurtured by ancient culture, has focused on spiritual life for thousands of years, and our views on material enjoyment have always been thin. Distinguished guests come from the most prosperous cities in the world, and comparing the material aspects, I am afraid it is difficult to have satisfactory impressions. The Mayor deeply apologizes for this point. China has always loved peace. After the European War, the people of the world still have lingering pain. You, based on the spirit of the League of Nations to stop war, strive for the realization of Sino-Japanese peace and to permanently maintain world peace. This is not only the hope of the people of the city but also the prayers of all nations that love peace. I raise my glass to wish you good health." Sir Lytton gave a reply, the original words were in English, translated into Chinese by Yan Deqing, roughly saying: "Today, my colleagues and I are very grateful for the Mayor's invitation. I am very honored that the distinguished members can visit Wuhan this time. Hankou is an important city in your country, and Hubei Province is also a very important place in your country's history. However, Hankou and the counties of your province have been greatly affected by the floods. The local situation must be very difficult due to this disaster. We are so well-treated and have such a grand banquet today, it has made us forget the suffering that Wuhan suffered last year. Although it is so on the surface, our hearts are still feeling</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>uneasy. We all know deeply the suffering of the places after the floods. For example, we have already been very concerned about the disasters caused by the great floods in India a few years ago. However, compared with the fact that more than 21 million people were affected by the floods in your province and more than 3 million people have no food and clothing, the difference is really like heaven and earth. Today we have come to Hankou and learned that there are still 300,000 people on the outskirts of Wuhan who feel that their lives cannot be resolved. Because the disaster situation in your country is so serious, countries around the world are trying to help. Recently, we also learned that there is still a very serious incident in your country. European and American countries, because of this serious incident, sent us to form an investigation team to come to the Far East to conduct on-the-spot investigations and find a basis for a solution. This is the mission entrusted to us. After arriving in your country, we have been soliciting opinions from all sectors of your country, hoping that Wuhan groups will provide us with as much material as we need. Today, I am very grateful to the Mayor for inviting us, especially for treating the distinguished members and myself so well. I would like to return the toast and wish your city a prosperous future."</p>
<p>Pacification Commissioner's Banquet: Pacification Commissioner He Chengjun held a banquet for the Investigation Team at the Deming Hotel on the evening of the 4th at 8:00 p.m. All members of the team attended. Chairman He Chengjun delivered a welcome speech, saying, "I am very pleased to have this opportunity to welcome you today. You all have glorious histories, and your presence in our area is a great honor for our province. Our province has suffered from floods and has also been affected by the Manchuria and Shanghai incidents. There are many simple and rude things in the reception, but the welcome is all sincere. Our country has expressed its acceptance of the resolutions of the League of Nations Administrative Council and the General Assembly. I think you have no doubt about our country's sincerity in longing for peace. Hubei is located in the center of China. Whenever there is an incident in China, this province immediately feels the impact. The sound of artillery fire in the Northeast and Shanghai shook the sky. How can the people here not be angry? I have tried my best to persuade them to believe in the League of Nations and wait for the League of Nations to resolve it fairly. Fortunately, the local area has been calm for several months, and Chinese and foreign merchants have lived in peace. I am glad to hear that you have come to investigate the floods. Looking back on the great flood last year, it was truly unprecedented. The disaster area accounted for more than two-thirds of the province, and the affected people reached 20 million. The dikes and embankments collapsed, the houses were submerged, and the number of displaced people was 8 million. After the disaster, the charitable organizations in the province tried their best to carry out disaster relief. However, the disaster was so great that it was necessary to rely on the central government to find a way and to raise donations overseas. Our central government originally had a large-scale disaster relief plan, but the plan was greatly affected due to the Manchuria Incident. At present, the province is facing difficulties due to the failure to provide sufficient relief to the disaster victims, and the difficulties are even more complex. It is conceivable how difficult it is to deal with security when it comes to starving disaster victims. I believe that the restoration of peace will have a way to revive disaster relief. Humanitarianism and the purpose of the League of Nations coincide. The position of the League of Nations is fair and impartial to all member states. We are only seeking a fair and impartial resolution to the Sino-Japanese incident. We firmly believe that the results of your investigation will be able to realize justice and fulfill our wishes. I raise my glass to wish you good health." Next, Sir Lytton replied, "Distinguished Director, Commander, and gentlemen, I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the entire delegation for your kind invitation today. The Director just expressed a sincere wish and warm welcome for the League of Nations Investigation Team to come to Wuhan. We are really flattered. And we are deeply grateful for the grand reception after Wuhan suffered an unprecedented flood. The team shares the pain in our hearts for the floods. Before we came to Hankou, we were very worried when we heard that the Wuhan floods had caused heavy losses. Now that we have arrived in Hankou and seen various situations, we are very envious of the Director's ability. When we came, we saw the situation of processing and repairing the dikes along the river, and we will have the opportunity to see the Wuhan dike project tomorrow. However, after your country suffered an unprecedented flood, an extremely serious incident occurred. We believe that if we work hard without fear of difficulties, we will definitely be able to find a considerable solution. We have received a lot of help and materials this time. However, your country can provide such relief for the floods. We hope that the whole country will unite to achieve good results in this more serious issue. Your country has raised this serious issue with the League of Nations. The League of Nations sent personnel to investigate, which is enough to show the sincerity of the League of Nations in cooperating with your country. At the same time, we hope that the governments of your country and Japan will also cooperate sincerely, and we hope that the people of both countries will also assist the government to achieve this sincere cooperation in order to seek peace in the Far East. We will also do our best to promote it. I would like to return the toast and wish you all good health." (April 4)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Prepares to Welcome the Investigation Team</h3>
<p>Authorities and the People Plan to Report to the Team</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondent: The League of Nations Investigation Team, led by Lytton, will soon arrive in the north. The Beining Railway Bureau recently received an order from the Beiping Pacification Commissioner's Office to prepare a special train of nineteen carriages to meet them in the south. The special train is beautiful and magnificent, far surpassing ordinary special trains. According to a telegram from Beijing, the investigation team will arrive in Pingjin around the 9th or 10th of this month after their trip to Hankou. The preparations for welcoming the team in Tianjin are currently being handled jointly by the provincial and municipal party and government. The provincial government has appointed Yan Zhiyi, member of the provincial committee, and Huang Zongfa, advisor, and the municipal party department has appointed Shao Hua and Liu Chenzhang of the Rectification Committee, and the municipal government has appointed Section Chief Shen Dijia and Zhang Ruiliu to form the "Preparatory Office for Welcoming the League of Nations Investigation Team." Because the investigation team plans to stay in Tianjin for half a day to inspect all the losses during the Tianjin Incident, the Preparatory Office decided at a meeting that the provincial and municipal authorities would designate the Xihu Hotel in the British Concession as the location for the welcome banquet for the investigation team. Regarding the groups that will welcome them at the station, they will be limited to nine sectors: Party, government, labor, commerce, academia, press, charity, autonomous region, and lawyers. The number of people is limited to no more than one thousand, fearing that it would be difficult to maintain order. Several representatives will be selected from the groups to board the special train to express their welcome when it arrives at the station. It has also been proposed that the provincial chairman and the mayor of Tianjin will lead the way, with the general representative of the people at the rear. All personnel from the groups entering the station to welcome the team will be issued badges by the Preparatory Office to avoid confusion. In addition to the military and police maintaining order at the station, the municipal party department has also summoned representatives of Boy Scouts from middle schools and above to discuss and decide that the Boy Scouts will also be responsible for maintaining order. As for the situation of the Tianjin Incident last year and our losses, the provincial and municipal authorities have compiled a report with very detailed content, which will be handed over when the team arrives in Tianjin. The people, on the other hand, have collected facts about the Japanese military's disturbances in Tianjin over the past few months and have put forward various opinions, which will be presented to the team by Zhang Boling, the general representative of the people, asking them to advocate for justice. However, Northern merchants are unscrupulous. While the Shanghai war is in full swing, Japanese goods sell well without any hindrance. The biggest reason for this is that on the one hand, merchants are unaware of the harm and are greedy for money, and on the other hand, the authorities are afraid that diplomacy with Japan will cause serious changes, so they have canceled the anti-Japanese association and allowed merchants to sell Japanese goods. This is truly hateful. (April 2)</p>
<h3>Japan Strictly Prohibits Reactionary Publications</h3>
<p>More than 400 cases in one month. The Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reported that the reactionary ideas that have recently been rampant in society are becoming increasingly dangerous. The number of reactionary publications is as vast as a surging flood. They worship left-leaning doctrines and publish various unstable printed materials to lure society and attempt to undermine the overall situation. The Security Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs, in view of the serious domestic and international situation, the sudden increase in social unrest, and the continued occurrence of various violent and terrorist incidents, has started to inspect books, magazines, and newspapers. In one month, more than 400 reactionary publications, such as books, magazines, and newspapers, have been administratively punished by being prohibited or deleted. In the past, the average monthly punishment was only about 150 cases, but now it has suddenly increased by more than three times. Since the Manchuria and Shanghai Incidents, most of the publications have been based on domestic political issues, such as the theory of terrorist politics and the theory of revolutionary practice. Last year, among the 1,500 to 1,600 publications that violated Anning, left-leaning movements accounted for nine-tenths. The authorities of the Ministry of Home Affairs believe that the future danger is unimaginable and have ordered strict suppression.</p>
<h3>American University Students Petition to Stop the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Complete economic severance with the aggressor country. The North China Daily News reported that American university students, like other Americans, are deeply concerned about the situation in the Far East. A number of American university students recently jointly petitioned President Hoover to fully support the League of Nations to stop hostile actions and to fairly resolve the dispute between China and Japan through appropriate methods such as conferences and arbitration. The student group of the National Christian Youth Association in this city recently received a copy of their petition, which stated that the petitioners are students from universities in the United States of America. They believe that if a future world war unfortunately occurs, the majority of the burden will fall on the students of today. Therefore, regarding the current international crisis, they respectfully offer their humble opinions, hoping that they will be adopted and implemented. The Kellogg-Briand Pact abolishes war as an instrument of national policy, and the League of Nations Charter also rejects war and seeks to prevent it. The Nine-Power Treaty further guarantees the territorial and administrative integrity of China. Japan has signed all three treaties, but its troops are now engaged in hostile actions within Chinese territory, which is a serious threat to the new spirit of handling international affairs and to the success of the tools for maintaining world peace. The students have absolutely no ill will towards the Japanese people. Even within Japan, there are those who denounce and oppose the policies of the military that have caused this bloodshed. However, the students have a firm will towards this situation and are willing to unite with people everywhere who are working to maintain peace to jointly plan and proceed. Therefore, they specifically appeal to the US government to cooperate with the League of Nations to the fullest extent and insist that there should be no more hostile actions between China and Japan. Disputes between the two sides should be resolved fairly through appropriate methods such as conferences and arbitration, and should never be affected in the slightest by what the troops of both sides have done and can do. In order to achieve this goal, the students earnestly request (1) to prohibit the transportation of all war equipment and items that can be used to manufacture war equipment, such as cotton and iron, to Japan and China, and (2) to use complete economic severance with the aggressor country as a last resort. They also request the representatives of our Senate and House of Representatives to support this plan with all their voting power, whether today or in the future, and to maintain the spirit and intention of this petition.</p>

<h3>Biography of Lieutenant Hsiao Tuo</h3>
<p>— Wang Dichang</p>
<p>The lieutenant's surname was Hsiao Tuo, his name was Robert. He was a native of Tacoma, Washington, in the United States. He was a sincere and chivalrous person. He was skilled in aviation and worked for the Gale Aircraft Company in his country, mainly as a driver. Later, he came to Shanghai, China, and lived in retirement (according to Gale, Mr. Gale). He also served as an aviation instructor in China and had many contracts with those who studied aviation in China. This year, Japan invaded Shanghai. Seeing its brutality and inhumanity, he was filled with righteous indignation. On February 21, he disguised himself and went to Wusong to snipe at Japanese airplanes, destroying one. On February 23, he heard the news of the enemy bombing Suzhou by air. He immediately drove an airplane called Bolin and followed them. He encountered six airplanes that were wreaking havoc on the people of Suzhou. When the enemy saw the lieutenant coming, they immediately covered him from above and below and attacked him. The lieutenant knew he had no chance, but he still calmly resisted and destroyed one airplane, annihilating its leader (according to the Continental Daily and the Times). He eventually died for his country at the age of twenty-seven (according to the lieutenant's statement to Gale Company). When the news came, the Chinese people were shocked and grieved. The National Assembly posthumously awarded the lieutenant and buried him with military honors on Chinese soil. This was an extraordinary honor. Wang Dichang said, "I heard that when the war was in full swing, the lieutenant said to his relatives, "I am a citizen of a neutral country and have nothing to protect in the meantime. But when humans see the inhuman killing, how can I bear it? How can I bear it? For the sake of righteousness and humanity, I cannot tolerate both. Even if I die, my heart is willing. What regrets do I have? But before I die, be careful not to say anything. If I die, report to my parents." (according to the evening edition of the Shibao Daily on February 25). Alas, the lieutenant is now dead for the sake of righteousness and humanity. The lieutenant has no regrets. But today's inhuman killing is still rampant and has not stopped. Can the lieutenant finally have no regrets? The lieutenant, as a foreigner, could not bear to see the Chinese people suffer inhuman killings, so he rose up to help righteousness and eventually died without regret. Compared with those who share the soil of the country and eat the grain of the country, who are only familiar with the slaughter and cry of the people of their country and do not see it, or even run away and fly high to protect their own hearts, then the death of the lieutenant seems unwise. Can the lieutenant really have no regrets? Alas!</p>
<h3>The Three Principles of the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Ancient sages said that governing the people is like caring for the eyes, and governing the army is like caring for the teeth. Those who care for the eyes strive to nourish them and do not allow them to be covered with dust. Those who care for the teeth strive to pick them clean and do not allow them to accumulate tartar. Alas! Those who govern the people today all let dust and filth cover their eyes, and those who govern the army all let accumulated tartar fill their mouths. Therefore, they allow enemy bandits to trample on the national territory and sit idly by while the people are plunged into misery, without being even slightly moved in their hearts. Is this what we expected?</p>
<p>Today, the youth of our Northeast have risen up to take on the heavy responsibility of self-determination, self-defense, and self-rescue to resist the enemy. Their name is "Volunteer Army." Their ambition is very great, but their actions are pitiful. However, the Volunteer Army did not originate in the Northeast. Even in Shanghai, they once organized into teams and participated in combat, bearing the responsibility of saving the nation and resisting tyranny. However, I believe that our countrymen, in this autumn of survival and extinction, must have three necessary points of great realization: ㈠ Must understand that just saying it with your mouth is just empty talk. ㈡ Must understand that writing a few sentences with a pen is also just armchair strategy. ㈢ Must understand that no matter how poignant the slogans, the enemy will never see them posted on the wall. Therefore, I believe that the reason why the Volunteer Army today can kill the enemy and achieve results lies not in temporary impulsiveness, but especially in the tenacious, unwavering, and unified perseverance and determination. Therefore, I add a folk song to earnestly tell patriotic people: To save the country, it is better to have it in your heart than in your mouth. Remember it firmly in your heart and never forget it, and one day you will be able to take revenge. To save the country, it is better to have it at the tip of a gun than at the tip of a pen. Aim the gun at the enemy and you can kill them, and one shot and one bullet will fulfill your ambition. To save the country, it is better to be on the city wall than on the wall. Hold the city wall firmly and the enemy cannot break through, and your功績will be留名 in the Party and the country.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Battle and Military Weapons ㈠</h3>
<p>— Yizang</p>
<p>From the ancient era of bows, arrows, swords, and spears to the era of the omnipotent guns and cannons, the progress of lethal weapons has cost countless efforts. However, today, those killing tools are useless. Why is that? The military weapons used today, along with the progress of science, the experience of war, and the improvement of various technologies, have subtleties that are beyond expectation. When we talk about military weapons, we can take the World War of 1914 as a dividing line. From the Great War to the present Sino-Japanese War, that is, this time the Japanese army used the latest military weapons, it can be divided into another period. Because the sharpening of science and technology in the past ten years has truly made us feel incredible.</p>
<p>Looking back at the warriors of the feudal era, they wore armor and carried bows, arrows, swords, and spears for self-defense. Today's infantrymen use iron helmets, iron vests, masks, hand grenades, pistols, rifles, grenade launchers, etc., for personal defense. In addition to personal defense, what other troop defenses are there? These defense methods are becoming more and more ingenious and unpredictable. The reason why they can reach such a state is entirely due to the great powers, taking the precious lessons of past battles as the weft and the essence of modern science as the warp, and making great efforts to improve their equipment and succeed. In order to maintain the existence of their countries, they do not hesitate to spend huge sums to prepare for future wars. Now I will classify and explain the evolution of military weapons and the new military weapons used by the Japanese army in the recent Shanghai War, so that we can know the cruelty of this war.</p>
<h3>Record of the Double-Story Building of the Or Horse (27)</h3>
<p>— Master of the Hall of Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter Four: The Marriage Contract Forces People to Hesitate and Worry, the Bandit Atmosphere Plunders the Land, and the Initial Quarrel Reopens</p>
<p>At this time, An Yutian was trapped in a heavy encirclement. Seeing that he had become a prisoner of the enemy, he not only had no way to escape, but also dared not struggle in the slightest. He hurriedly begged for surrender in a loud voice, "Let go. What you said makes sense. Of course, I agree." After saying that, Li Wenxia happily loosened her slender hand. An Yutian suddenly hesitated and said, "However, I still need to discuss it with Mr. Wei Zhuomou before I can decide." Li Wenxia suddenly heard that he seemed to be using cunning words to delay.</p>
<p>She couldn't help but tighten the strength of her hand that had just relaxed. She grabbed his arm tightly, widened her eyes, and questioned him in a pressing manner, "What are you saying? Can't you make the decision yourself in matters of love between men and women? Why do you have to ask Mr. Wei? Looking at you in the future... " Speaking of this, the following words were originally intended to condemn him for being too heartless and insincere, and for not using such clever words to deceive a weak woman who loves him. But privately, it was as if a bottle of vinegar had been spilled in her heart, soaking her in a sour and uncomfortable way. Two lines of hot tears burst out from the corners of her eyes like scattered beans, and her voice choked and she could no longer speak. An Yutian saw that the situation was even more unfavorable. He could never win against the Misses in verbal battles. So he adopted the diplomatic method of a weak country, starting with an apology and then explaining, "This is my fault again. I made you sad again because I didn't say a word clearly. But you may have misunderstood. The reason why I want to discuss it with Mr. Wei is to ask him to be a formal introducer when you and I announce our engagement, not to let him decide on this big issue." This explanation was very clever. Li Wenxia turned from sorrow to joy, and broke into tears. She not only canceled the demonstration movement of coercion and holding, but also slowly wiped away the tears on her fair cheeks. She put on a gentle and docile attitude, helped An Yutian back to the bedside and sat down side by side, and continued to discuss in detail the various necessary procedures when announcing the engagement. She even shamelessly, as if unintentionally, involved the various equipment in the cohabitation issue. An Yutian managed to get back to the clear sky, calm winds and waves. Naturally, he was cautious and did not dare to cause any more trouble. Whatever she asked and said, he always answered according to her wishes, and there was no place that did not cater to her heart. This lured her into dispelling all her doubts and relaxing her body and mind.</p>

However, the Chinese, due to the market decline, still do not know when to withdraw funds, so the use is still sluggish.

There was no hope for the full development of commerce. The market was still without spirit. It was found that the stock of each factory was increasing day by day. It is said that the total stock in the whole port is about 30,000 to 40,000 bales, of which about 14,000 to 15,000 bales are 16-count yarn.

<h3>Raw Cotton Consumption Continues to be Active</h3>
<p>The cotton market situation is relatively stable, but the trend of American cotton is weak, and it is estimated that the overall situation is still likely to decline due to the sluggish world consumption. However, the real demand for local cotton has been more active recently. The Shenxin Factory will settle the foreign cotton and change to buying local cotton for consumption, so the business has improved. The Shenxin Factory purchased a huge amount of raw materials yesterday, all sold by the China Cotton Industry Trading Company, and the goods and money will be cleared in three weeks. The prices of the sales are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 32.25 Congxin Factory entered 1300 bales Spot goods delivered to the factory</p>
<p>Dongtai Cotton 34.25 Congxin Factory entered 200 bales Spot goods delivered to the factory</p>

<h3>Food Pujiang Rice Market Sales are Strong and Prices are Firm</h3>
<p>South City Yesterday, about ten ships arrived. This street's out-road has slightly increased the 粳 shape of Changxi, Sutong, and Beihu, etc., and the opening price is one ruler higher than the ordinary one. The secondary color is mediocre. Qingjiao Flying Phoenix Bo稻 is still active due to the lack of goods, and it has risen by half a corner. The early rice passenger gang picked high and took a little, and Zhongguan did not care at all. The market was depressed.

The opening of April was 4 taels 7 钱, and the weighed goods in April were 4 taels 7 钱 3 分, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Powder Market is Rising Again and Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's powder market passenger transformation was flat, while the factory owners, brokers, and囤户, etc. used each other and raised prices mutually, resulting in repeated price increases. The spot battleship has reached 2 taels 07 分半, and May has reached 2 taels 08 分. The factory side has an expression of 2 taels 1 钱, so if the factory side continues to manipulate, the market may have to increase again, but foreign wheat is reported to be small. The passenger office stopped due to the high price, and the future market seems to be not optimistic.</p>

The passenger gang is also sporadic. Yesterday, the Sichuan gang slightly transacted white muslin yarn. The Deki chain sold for 3 钱 1 分, and the most beautiful 3 钱. Some also sold 2 钱 9 分. The Fujian gang has a more active appetite for weaving flower foreign yarn. Taihe Jindian sold for 3 钱 1 分半, Deki three suspicions for 3 钱 1 分. 素洋 yarn is still firm because there are not many arrivals. Yesterday, the fine cloth of this factory was still firm. Peacock is still 7 taels 7 钱 7 分半. The dyeing factory is very interested in entering. The coarse cloth, the 16-pound double fish Jiqing spot goods have arrived, selling 7 taels 8 钱半. The Hubei Tianzi turned down, to 8 taels 2 钱. The 11-pound Yihe goods spot goods still need to be distributed, and the price is generally 4 taels 3 钱半. The 9-pound cloth is quite dull. Yihe漂布云外飘香Spot goods are out of stock. Jin Santare 8 taels 9 钱半, 宁波gang slightly handled some. White flannelette lining velvet is still eagerly out of the way, three deer heads are 3 钱 2 分半, and double fish Jiqing is 3 钱 1 分半, and the retail price is increased by 1 分 per yard.</p>
<h3>Watt呢暢銷川帮</h3>
<p>Various Watt呢, recently the Sichuan gang has been进胃Quite strong. The plaid yellow and gray are selling better. The diagonal dot chocolate丁 is also needed.

<h3>The League of Nations Investigation Team Lost a White Iron Box</h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Team and its party boarded the Longhe ship in Beijing on April 1 to go north. Suddenly, Sir Lytton's white iron box was reported missing. If this news is indeed true, then it must be regarded as a rare and important theft.</p>
<p>The luggage of the Investigation Team and the representative office was entrusted to the China Travel Service for transportation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a special commissioner to help take care of it. With such a solemn matter, Sir Lytton's white iron box disappeared without a trace. May I ask what the Travel Service transported? What did the commissioner take care of? The China Travel Service and the commissioner are indeed to blame for their negligence and recklessness.</p>
<p>What is strange is that there are many people in the Investigation Team and the representative office, and naturally there are not a few pieces of luggage. Why is it that among the luggage, other people's items are not missing, but only Sir Lytton's white iron box is missing? The intention of the thief is not difficult to guess. Although Sir Lytton is on the ship, he is working non-stop, and all the telegrams coming and going are answered one by one.</p>
<p>The relationship in is very important, it is not difficult to guess. However, since the luggage was entrusted to the Travel Service for transportation and the government sent a special commissioner to take care of it, the thief was able to steal it away without any effort. I cannot but admit the thief's high level of skill. When Lu Zengxiang went to the Paris Peace Conference, he passed through Yokohama, and a box containing important documents also disappeared without a trace, which is the same trick as the thief this time. How strange.</p>
<p>Gold and silver are the thief's only target. However, this thief does not steal gold and silver, but steals important documents, which is very different from ordinary thieves. What should I call this kind of thief? Call it a political thief. In simple terms, call it a political bandit.</p>

<h3>The Lame Beggar's Tale</h3>
<p>— Wang Aoxi</p>
<p>Walking along Nanjing Road at night, a lame beggar followed me. He hobbled and begged, tears streaming down his face. I asked him why he was crying, and the beggar poured out his heart. "My home is in Jiangbei, where I had fields to till. Last autumn, the great flood came, and all my land and house were washed away. I dare not blame the water officials, but silently swallow my anger. I brought my mother to Shanghai, renting a room in Yokohama. My wife and children cry every day, with no rice to cook. I pull a rickshaw, and my wife works as a servant. Our youngest child is just a year and a half old, and my mother takes care of the grandchild. My mother washes clothes for others, which is even harder than my work. Hardship is hardship, but we were still living in relative peace. Who knew that on January 28th, rumors of war would spread? My wife was laid off, returning with tears in her eyes. She said that the wealthy had fled to England with their families, asking if I planned to flee as well and urging me not to hesitate. I replied that I was a poor ghost with nothing to lose, why should I be alarmed? I continued to pull my rickshaw, working until the third watch. Suddenly, gunfire erupted. The Japanese bandits showed their brutality. I couldn't go home, so I lived by my rickshaw. Days passed, but peace seemed impossible. No one wanted to ride in my rickshaw, and I had no way to alleviate my poverty. The Japanese bandits are truly hateful, turning me into a refugee. I decided to join the army to drive the invaders back to Tokyo. I saw the volunteer army and joined them, eager to serve. After only seven days of training, I went to the battle of Miaohang. We fought fiercely for three days and nights, determined to vent our resentment. But with planes and tanks, the enemy's strength was overwhelming. The shells rained down, turning our comrades into dust. My leg was shattered, and I was sent to Suzhou for treatment. Before my wound healed, our army suddenly retreated. Once I recovered, my unit disbanded. I wanted to rejoin the army to fight the invaders to the end, but my leg is now lame, and I can't go to the front lines. I wanted to enter a veterans' hospital, but I don't know where to inquire. I pleaded with the military administration department, but they said I was not a regular soldier. I stumbled back to Shanghai to find my family, but my home was a pile of ashes, with only skeletal remains. I am left as a useless wreck, neither dead nor alive. I hate the commander, who is so heartless. If he couldn't defend Shanghai, why engage in such a futile battle? The country is important, and life is light. If long-term resistance were possible, who wouldn't be willing to sacrifice? But to resist and then fail, what was the point of the sacrifice? You have ruined me so terribly, how can I survive the remaining days? Sir, please have pity and give me a few coins. Skipping just one show can help me live for a few more weeks." Hearing the lame beggar's words, I felt sorrow mixed with anger. Why not find the commander and ask him the truth of the matter?"</p>

<h3>Wireless Cinema</h3>
<p>— TW</p>
<p>In recent years, scientific progress has been rapid, almost at a pace of a thousand miles a day. What were once astonishing ideals have become everyday realities. To soar through the air and ride the clouds, we have airplanes; to transmit messages across thousands of miles, we have the telegraph; to converse with people in distant places, we have the telephone. Now, we even have the ability to shrink distances and see through obstacles. We can not only hear voices and music from afar, but also sit at home and watch scenes and people from distant lands. Who can say that the "thousand-mile eye" is impossible to realize?</p>
<p>Wireless cinema (Television) is a method of transmitting moving scenes from one place to another using electricity. After the invention of aviation, this is the greatest new invention in the scientific world. In 1909, the American Hugo Gernsback was the first to use the word "Teleusion". For more than twenty years, scientists around the world have been engaged in the research of wireless cinema. Those who have successfully conducted the research include scientists at Bell Telephone Laboratories in the United States, and the Englishman Baird. They have all created effective wireless cinema transmitters and receivers. The principles and functions of these two devices are briefly described below.</p>
<p>The transmission and reception of wireless telephone work by first converting sound waves into electrical waves at the transmitting station, which then pass through the ether of space to the receiver, where the electrical waves are converted back into sound waves. The transmission and reception of wireless cinema are similar. First, light waves emitted from a human face or object are converted into electrical waves at the transmitting station, which are transmitted through space to the receiving device, where the electrical waves are converted back into light waves. The most important components in wireless cinema are the photoelectric cell, which converts light waves into electrical waves, and the neon tube, which converts electrical waves into light waves. The former is known as the "electric eye" and is a highly sensitive photoelectric cell. When light shines on it, it is converted into an electric current. The stronger the light, the stronger the current; conversely, the weaker the light, the weaker the current. If there is no light, there is no current. The latter is a tube filled with neon gas. When an electric current passes through it, it emits light. The stronger the current, the stronger the light emitted; the weaker the current, the weaker the light. If there is no current, it is dark and lightless.</p>
<p>However, with only the above-mentioned transmission method, the image obtained by the receiving device would be nothing more than a blur. This is because the light is merged together. To solve this problem, a light-interrupter is needed. The light-interrupter used in Bell's wireless cinema transmitter and receiver is a rotating perforated disc. The disc has fifty holes arranged in a spiral pattern. When transmitting an image, the human face or object to be transmitted is first illuminated with a strong light, and the rotating disc is rapidly rotated. The light rays falling on the human face pass through the holes in the rotating disc in sequence—that is, the first light ray passes through the first hole, the second light ray passes through the second hole, and so on—and are then projected onto the photoelectric cell, where they are converted into electrical currents of varying strengths. However, these currents are too weak to be used for transmission, so they are amplified by an amplifier and then transmitted through the antenna into space, where they are carried to the antenna of the receiving device and guided to the receiver. An amplifier amplifies the received current and transmits it to the neon tube. This tube emits light of corresponding intensity according to the strength of the current. The light then passes through a rotating disc with holes, the size, position, and rotation speed of which are exactly the same as the disc at the transmitting station. The equal speed of the two discs is controlled by a synchronous motor. The light rays pass through the rotating disc in sequence and are finally projected onto the screen, forming the image of the original object.</p>
<p>This method is tantamount to dividing the human face into two thousand five hundred small squares (fifty in each direction), forming light spots of varying intensities that are scattered and then reassembled at the receiving device, restoring the original appearance. Because the scattering and assembly are extremely rapid, and because the human eye has the effect of persistence of vision, we cannot distinguish the sequence of the spots, but only perceive that the whole image appears simultaneously. Baird's transmitter and receiver are similar to this, except that Baird uses sixteen lenses instead of fifty small holes, and a toothed disc as a light-interrupter.</p>

<h3>What I Saw in a Township</h3>
<p>— Wenzhi</p>
<p>The quiet P. Township, only a dozen or so li from Huangdu, was constantly resounding with the sounds of gunfire and flashing with light, throwing its residents into a state of panic and eager hope that the local administrative organs—the District Office and the Defense Corps—would find a way to maintain order.</p>
<p>Late at night, all sounds ceased. Suddenly, a cacophony of noises arose, and the atmosphere of the whole township became tense. The residents' anxiety increased. But the public officials whom the people were hoping for were also running and shouting frantically amidst the chaos: "Run for your lives! Run!" Ah! The people of the township, who had already fallen asleep, were awakened, hastily supporting the elderly and carrying the young, fleeing outwards. In an instant, the houses in the township became "nine out of ten empty." However, there were also calm elderly people who, amidst the commotion and chaos, said to those who were fleeing in haste: "It's alright! We have people in our locality responsible for guaranteeing our security, and the image of their courage and vigor is enough to resist strong enemies. Otherwise, what's the use of the Defense Corps that we've been paying for every year? They have guns and bullets, and when it comes to defending the country and protecting the people, they have an inescapable duty. We common people only need to prepare what they need when they kill the enemy and cook rice and porridge for them. We must not all run away."</p>
<p>Many people listened to the elderly man's words, and most nodded in agreement. They put down their bags and returned home, and some enthusiastically wanted to wash rice and cook, preparing a hearty meal for the Defense Corps before they went to kill the enemy.</p>
<p>At this moment, suddenly a group of leather shoes sounded disorganized. Many people shouted, "A great fire has broken out outside the township! A large force of Japanese soldiers is coming! Run for your lives!" The people of the township were greatly alarmed, rushing out of their doors to see what was happening. But they saw the Defense Corps in groups, running frantically and shouting like they were being chased by wolves and tigers. However, the Japanese soldiers had not yet arrived, and there was only a fire in the sky several li away. However, with this, all the people of the township, scared by the Defense Corps, ran away completely, suffering spiritual pain and material losses beyond description. What were their intentions? No one can answer for them. And what were the people of the township's hopes for them? Alas!</p>

<h3>Everyday Reputation</h3>
<p>— Peizhi</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai on January 28th, the voices of newspaper vendors selling newspapers have been clamorous in the marketplace, especially on the days when the Shen and Xin newspapers were issuing evening editions. Every afternoon, Wangping Street would be teeming with people shouting "Extra! Extra!" in quick succession, attracting most of the passersby on the road—except for the blind (literate)—to take out their wallets and buy several kinds of newspapers to read.</p>
<p>Although the various newspapers reported largely the same information about the war and other important news, no matter what newspapers people had already read, they always had to buy a copy of the old Shenbao to see if it had any particular news before they could be certain. Otherwise, even if they saw the most reliable news in other newspapers, they would still be skeptical and dare not fully believe it. This is not because they blindly believe in the old Shenbao's "old brand," but because the Shenbao's everyday reputation is more accurate and reliable than any other newspaper. It always prefers to "err on the side of caution" and is unwilling to publish unconfirmed news lightly. That's why, last year, when other newspapers spread rumors that the water level in Shanghai would rise twelve feet, the Shenbao did not make such a laughingstock of itself. This shows the importance of being mature and prudent, just like the words of experienced and seasoned elderly people, which, although not every sentence is a profound truth, are ultimately more reliable than the words of young people who have not seen much of the world.</p>
<p>This kind of reputation depends on daily cultivation. Although no one feels it particularly during ordinary times, when the wind is strong, the grass is firm, and when extraordinary events are recorded, even a person without keen eyesight can distinguish between high and low. This is true not only for newspapers, but also for personal reputation. If we want to gain the trust of others, we should not make promises lightly from a young age. If we speak carelessly and sensationalize things just to please people for a moment, the Western mirror will be broken one day, and we will be worth nothing.</p>
<p>I am grateful to Mr. Yu Peizhi for his letter, which praises me excessively, and I am deeply ashamed. However, whether the above words are Mr. Yu's personal opinion or a common assessment by society, this newspaper dares not claim or believe. However, the editorial staff encourages each other to strive for accuracy and speed, and to err on the side of caution. For sixty years, we have followed the rules of Xiao He and Cao Can, adhering to this principle. This is something we can be confident in, and we dare to assure our readers of this. We are publishing Mr. Yu's letter on the right to seek the judgment of society. Editor's note.</p>
