<p>時評</p>
<h3>民主黨獲選説與世界經濟之展望仁</h3>
<p>本月初旬之美總統選舉。轉瞬即届。據各方之情報與預測。現總統胡佛之下台己萬不可免。而民主黨羅斯福之獲選。將爲未來必然之事實。此預測之是否確實。吾人雖未能肯定然今日胡佛之地位。實不僅受擠於民主黨或其他在野左翼政黨。即共和黨之左派。亦大有起而抨擊之者。故胡佛之動摇。殆己大勢顯明。而民主黨之崛起。亦己有山雨欲來之勢。</p>
<p>夫民主黨反對胡佛之最大口實。爲胡佛之「煽動投機的空景象。」顧最近胡佛景氣宣揚策之效果。市塲確曾一度好轉。惟不久仍歸泡影。然此乃資本主義現階段之癓結。初固不能即藉胡佛之積極策而有好轉也。故胡佛債極策之無能。雖備受民主黨之抨擊。而民主黨獲選後。是否即能轉換另一方策。而打破今日胡佛之假景氣。此一問題。吾人縱不敢斷其絶對的不可能。但亦可必其殊非易事耳。蓋今日胡佛積極策中之最重要者。厥爲格拉斯。史汀辯兩法。（通貨澎漲政策。）而格拉斯者。史汀辯爾者。民主黨人也。同時。今日活動於美國政府之首腦部。又大都爲民主黨人。如金融復興會社之社長鮑麥倫。即屬民主黨員。此外過去通過下院之通貨澎漲政策提案者高爾斯保爾氏。亦屬民主黨中之重要分子。故今日縱令民主黨可以獲選。其在美國之經濟政策。决不致有若何之變動。結果。無論關税問題。通貨問題。民主黨之必將重彈共和黨之老調。殆己無疑</p>
<p>今日世界經濟問題之三大治癌。一爲列國之關税壁壘。二爲世界通貨問題。（金本位之動摇。）三爲戰債。一二兩者。有相互爲因相互爲果之作用。來年世界經濟會議。己列入此二者爲主要議題。然關税問題之解决。全視乎英美之有讓步勇氣與否。今民主黨必然的仍步胡佛之後塵。則此癌之終將爲癌。殆可斷言至通貨問題之解决。則以關税問題爲前提。關税一日不解决</p>
<p>則通貨之動摇。豈能倖免哉。至於戰債問題。則爲一部分美國人民美國政府及歐洲之三角關係。戰債能否取消。全視乎美國人民之意志。美政府固不能肯斷一詞。故羅斯福即代胡佛以興。其於戰債之態度。終不能變今日之現狀也。</p>
<p>總之。今日世界之恐慌。爲資本主義現段階應有之現象。原非以「頭痛醫頭」之處方箋可以療治。而民主黨與共和黨之交替實不過一換湯不换藥之變易。故欲翼民主黨之崛起以救美國。以救世界。誠戞戞乎其難。</p>
<p>吾人認爲欲恢復今日世界之繁榮。必須修正目前之惡制度。然後關税通貨可以不生問題。戰債亦可解决。不然。任資本主義王國之美政治如何變動。世界經濟會議千百次召集。恐慌終將爲恐慌也。</p>

<p>自由談二一枝譚拾彈子吞彈  瞻廬　　頑童拾取遺留在土中的炸彈玩弄，轟然一聲，釀成斷指裂體的慘禍，這是一二八以來淞滬一帶數見不鮮的事實，尤其是最近閘北新家宅路江北小孩董大賽子拾取開花砲彈玩弄，一經炸裂，死傷至三十八人之多，頑童無知，害死了許多人，自己也死於非命，其愚可笑，其死可憐。假使董入賽子早知是炸彈，當然不拾了；無如，頑童眼光淺短，拾了這危險物，宛如天賜黃金非常快活；直到抛擲玩弄、將近爆裂的時候，有人制止他，説是炸彈，玩不得的；但己無濟於事了！董大賽子便即首先破肚流腸，而死於這不祥的炸彈的之下！　　一個閘北的頑童，拾了炸彈，己釀成了這般的巨禍；一個世界的頑童，吞了炸彈，便怎麽樣？唉！不爆裂，便罷:要是爆裂起來、可以激起着太平洋中排天般波浪！彈片所及，可以打破世界各國和平之門，至於，吞炸彈的破肚流腸，做那董入賽子第二，這是無庸説的了。閘北頑童拾炸彈，這是報紙上告訴我的；世界頑童吞炸彈，這是他們自己人説的，閘北頑童拾炸彈，是己經爆裂的了；世界頑童吞的炸彈，畢竟爆裂不爆裂，須看他肯吐出。今日之事  朱𦐂　　—説眞方賣假藥—　　抗日英雄馬占山將軍，向全國同胞乞援的書裏，説：「東北抗日之軍隊，無政府絲毫之庇護，」這眞使我民衆聽着，太覺悽慘可痛了。然而北平的「時輪金剛法會，」却又東也匯捐二萬，西也助捐五萬，而活佛的供給，還不在内。我不知救國工作，活佛的摇鈴，舞斧，誦經的祈禳和平，其效力眞能勝過枕戈鏖戰，義勇軍的拚命抗日麽？不然，何厚於此而薄於彼呢！　　在這個年頭，做生意，眞太難做了。花柳醫生經了名人介紹不算，還要自撰官文，才能招引得病家登門。於是那利用現代社會沉迷財色病態的欺騙書籍，發行的當兒，請了皇皇大律師做起保障來了。這呌做「説眞方，賣假藥。」那輩財迷與情狂、財色還没有解决，出書的名人，却己不從勤儉與婚姻，圓滿解决了金錢與肉慾。　　摩登姑娘們，做了高材三，更進一步，還要充文學家或詩人：於是終日偎在男性胸懷裏的女郎，也會高唱不做男子玩物，一事不幹的機關職員，也會駡紅花瓶的無恥。這眞像專販劣貨的奸商，高唱愛國論調，拚命内戰的軍閥偏説救國衛民，呌做祇當喧傅，並無别用。上海無「天」  定　　—正反二解—　　在上海服務的朋友們，他辦公處所規模愈大。接近電燈的機會愈多，丨當然不是一概而論，那麽見天的機會，也就愈少。璧如早上天色晴佳，進去服務，到得公畢出來，天色己晚，或有下雨下雪，在裏面是一些也不會知道的。　　見天不過是一句話。空氣的接近，倒是眞實的。他們的設備，雖然有氣窗流通空氣：夏天有電扇，冬天有水汀，以事調和，可是不能與外界空氣作一整個的通流。這究是科學上的一個缺點!而且種樹的馬路，除了貴族色彩極濃重的静安寺路，愚園路，極司菲而路，西摩路，霞飛路……以外：其他商肆櫛比		的馬路，竟連一張樹葉都找不到，這不是失了都市的科學化嗎。　　在習慣了的服務者，爲生活所驅使，倒也覺不到什麽？在無形中却增加了你的虚弱，損害了你的健康。你不是醫家，又那會透澈了解你病的來由？曾聽一位有醫學經騐的朋友説：「在鄉村能活十年：到上海却要減折一半！」看是戲語，但有一部分理由。丨這是正解。　　　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　　上海有一般人在黑暗中討生活的，簡直不將「天」旅在眼裏！「天」，就是法律的意見那些：襲官，舞弊，售及，聯仇，私仇，偷運，綁票，暗殺，賣淫，秘戲，以及其他種種，都是暗無天日的舉動！他們爲什麽會幹此種營生呢？有些人説：「環境造成，蔓延普及，纔有如此局面！」説來雖然也有理由：如其反問一句：「環境是什麽人造成的呢？」這樣，在上海的朋友們，都有反過來把環境改造一下的責任！丨這是反解。宣南梅訊  青琴　　—將重游歐美來滬爲子殤延期—　　比日盛傅梅蘭芳將重來滬上甚有謂己定某日動身、或云某處堂會，某處義務戲己約定者，兹據平友所述梅氏最近情形，詳誌如下：　　梅元配王氏，即王少樓之姑，生一子名永，七歲而殤，嗣後即不育。側室福芝芳。初生亦不久即殤，第三名名葆琦，乳名小三，最爲珍異，膚色玉映，眉宇軒昻，望之酷似梅之兒時，天資頴悟，在外交部高等小學肄業，每試必第一，所得奬牌纍纍，且能到善畫，頗有條理，梅奇愛之，福之專房，實以有此兒故。不意本月十七日，驟患白喉，延中醫楊浩如至，誤以爲風火，投以表藥，不數小時而殤：今年己足九歲，梅氏痛悼之情，匪可言喻，前此所傅南行各説，至此而全行閣起。　　最近則黃金榮杜月笙兩君，又派一徐姓北上，力挽其南下，聞梅表示兩點：第一自己原擬閉門休息，不再出演，以班中各角要求，改於明年實行，届時梅本人或赴歐美游歷，實無意來滬，即來亦决爲最後次；第二此來不受合同約束，如爲醫院等慈善事業，可勉盡義務，聞表示極堅决。　　梅氏丰采如昔，嗓音尤佳，瑶卿蘭元皆謂其寛而堅實，與老夫子異曲同工，在北平非常忙碌，省市及社會上有較大宴會，無不柬約參加，如公宴調查團，如故宫開會，報告眞相；如最近華洋義賑會歡迎美國恊約會長白樹伯，皆約之列席，尤以歐美人士，對梅之藝術，與謙恭温和之態度，備極歡美也。　　梅自游美後，迄未排演新劇，最近始排兩齣；一爲桃花扇，梅自飾李香君，翻原書駡筵等四齣，爲皮簧；一爲伏后駡曹，亦内府舊本，其内容説明，己稍由國劇畫報，首先披露云。馬褂打不倒  黃影呆　　—不過搬了家—　　打倒馬褂！」「打倒馬家褂！」的口號，在前幾年，早己塵囂於各大都市之中了，大體説來，男人的身上，除，極少的一部分人，眼前仍舊穿着馬褂而外，多數是不穿馬褂了，也可算是打倒了，其實馬褂並没有打倒，不過搬了家，從男人的身上，搬到了女人的身上吧了。　　不信，你看在都市中的街市之上，走過的摩登女郎，身上穿的旗袍之外，當此暮秋的天氣，又加上了件黑的或别種顔色的半載外衣，或是絨缐的短大衣，形色上，不是和男子的馬褂。完全相同嗎？伊們在馬路上行走，你打從後面或前面走去，老遠的一望，還不是和七八年前面走去，穿着長袍馬褂的形狀一樣嗎？所以我以爲與其説馬褂打倒，不如説馬褂搬家，從男人的身上，搬到了女人的身上。　　時間在不停的前進，空間跟着不停的在演進，一切的一切，都在不停的變幻之中：男人的衣服，長袍馬褂，既然搬到了女人的身上，女人的衣服，短服和裙子，經過了X年以後，也許會搬到男人的身上吧？我們且期待着事實來證明。短訊  若　　開設於英租界望平街口之中國灌音公司、自本月十四日開幕以來、各界紛紛前往灌者、逸社票友日前亦往灌音、灌畢、由一女職員持片就唱機試唱、與市售唱片較、殊難軒輊、惟該片爲銀色製成、質地形式俱臻優美、尺寸大小亦		均完備、據言如灌平劇、以十寸八寸兩種爲宜云説部扶輪會死之岔道（一）  范烟憍　　一·象牙床之夢　　在月明星稀之下，一個中年的農婦，走過翠微村的前，對一家矮屋前坐着的小姑娘説：　　　「愛姑！怎的單獨在這兒？你聽！那邊正唱得起勁，不去聽聽我們村上，五年没有有過這們熱閙的會了」。　　被呼爲愛姑的小姑娘，當眞默默的静聽了幾秒鐘，從微微的凉風裏，傅來前村待佛的音樂聲，歌唱聲，雖然不懂是什麽戲，是無論如何，是很動聽的，况且在寂寥的空間，又給農婦引逗着，怎樣不躍躍欲試！但是只能微喟着回答説：　　「三嬸嬸！一家老少都去了，門户是要緊的，我怎好再走？」　　「愛姑眞好，十五歲的小姑娘，己懂得這些事，懂豎還去也不睡不着，我和你談談，倒怪有味兒的，談畢，就在矮屋的門檻上坐了下來，愛姑急忙立起來，把坐得温温的小竹凳子讓伊坐，三嬸嬸推着不坐，嚷着：這裡好，這裡舒服，你坐罷，我要聽你的山歌，你坐了，唱幾隻給我聽聽。一　　「愛姑忸怩着説：「我不會唱的。」」　　三嬸嬸一壁握着伊的手，一壁伊起了郣子，低低的吚唔：「我前天還聽得你在趕水的時候，喝一一個姐兒七寸長，躱在茄窠底下乘風凉呢。我知道你有一肚皮的山歌，隨便抽出幾隻來，夠啦。」　　「山歌弗唱忘記多。」愛姑也吚唔着，用一種半唱半白的聲調，很自然地從不加粉飾而有自然美的檀口櫻唇裡吐出來，「既然三嬸嬸愛聽，我唱」一隻短一些的罷。」三嬸嬸張開了嘴，無聲地笑，連説：「短的也好，短短的好，唱，唱，唱罷！」愛姑在想，三嬸嬸在静聽，頓時静默了，前村悠揚的音樂聲，歌唱聲，又在嬝嬝地從凉風裏吹送過來了，似乎在那裡招攪愛姑：「全村的人，除掉殘廢以外，都來過了，怎麽你獨遠離呢。　　「天浪一隻花小籃，新做新婦多化難，早晨爬起拎水淘米燒飯喫，日頭未出公要飯，碗盞勤洗婆要駡，姑娘小叔要面湯。還去告訴爹爹聽，妹妹　嫁鄉下人，要嫁蘇州城裡去，摇扇子，把風凉，長手巾，掛在和合腦，和合枕頭和合被，和合被頭象牙床。」</p>

<h3>提倡短衣</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>本刋增加「改良社會討論會」一門，而首先提倡者，即爲改良服制一事，因爲「長袍馬褂」，非特沿襲滿清舊，亦且累墜不堪，而穿西裝，亦是拾人牙慧，步人後塵，我們應該自己來創造一種最適宜的服制，這個問題，討論多時，因爲情勢關係，尚没有具體的解决，然大多數主張學生裝式，最爲合宜，因爲簡單而又利便也，</p>
<p>昨見報載「四川楊森，以長袍博帶，非但無振作精神，且行動諸多不便，極力提倡短衣通令防區内人民一律不准再穿長袍、並責成警察，持利剪巡視街道遇有再穿長袍者，即剪去其下段，」這個方法，我深爲贊成，不過在贊成之中，還有一些異議，便是没有制定一種普通一律的服式也，自辛亥革命以來，女子服裝，千變萬化，無奇不有，極光怪陸離的能事，提倡奢侈，表示怪狀，像這類的改變，我不贊成，馬二先生老布棉襖，腰圍又闊又大的布帶，此種服制，太覺神聖化，我亦不贊成，我所主張的就是學生裝一類的服制，惟以國貨原料爲主要條件</p>
<p>但這個問題，不是知的問題，是行的問题，假定僅僅紙上談兵，而不肯去提倡實行，毫無意義，所以我主張约集幾位同志，大家先穿起來，以示提倡，戰國時，趙武靈王欲胡服騎射，以教百姓，遂引起一般頭腦冬烘的大臣們反對，但武靈主力排衆議，「謂利身之謂服，更事之謂教，衣服之制，所以齊常民</p>
<p>非所以論賢者也，」可知欲改革舊習，古人所難，現在國民的思潮，雖非盡趨於崇古主義、但仍舊有不少的先生們，以爲不是寛衣博帶、不足以表示我大國民的態度，不足以表示我個人的人格，一領長袍馬褂，至死不肯放鬆，深爲詫異，</p>
<p>從民國以來，所謂國利民福者，祇有剪去三千煩惱絲一事，當初剪之時，因爲少見多怪，相視而笑，亦覺奇異，今若見有一人，拖長辫者，亦必以奇怪頑固目之，則改革服制亦無異於是，今日以長袍馬褂爲體面者，安知後日不與拖長辫者同一視爲怪物呢，故如有贊成本刋提倡短衣，並主張實行者，請投函</p>

<h3>藥水肥皂</h3>
<p>— 陶宏</p>
<p>日常消毒的工作！這祇是説用在消毒皮膚或洗滌衣服時的工作，大都多用藥水肥皂，牠也是一種很需要的東西。今把造法寫下：</p>
<p>最初是要做一個肥皂的模型，然後再將藥物加進去。譬如石炭酸的肥皂可照下列方法做去。</p>
<p>一·椰子油ＣoＣoauutoil二十磅，練過的牛油或羊油四鎊，炭酸鈉溶液（波氏比重三三丨四０）二十磅，石炭酸一磅。</p>
<p>將液體化之牛油攪進在華氏一百十三度温度之灰水中，當其開始化合時再將椰子油加入，最後始將石炭酸加進，後者須調拌得極均匀後，以極敏捷之手段傾入模内，蓋好候其乾即可用。但代替石炭酸可用二磅硫黃華，此即硫黃肥皂之造法。硫黃皂亦可用以殺菌。</p>
<p>二，棉子油二百分（以重量計），酒精（９０％）三百分水三百二十五分苛性鈉四十五分炭酸鉀十分醚（Ｆther）五十分石炭酸二十五分</p>
<p>將棉子油與水百分；酒精二百分；</p>
<p>苛性鈉四十五分，在大瓶中混合，　化作用起後，再將其餘之酒精與炭酸鉀使溶在餘剩之水中，最後將石炭酸僣醚（即以脱）加進。上兩項一齊加進前面的大瓶中，再整個摇盪。此混合物。須置在能嚴蓋的瓶中並收藏在常温中（華氏七十度）。用時即取出和在水中洗條物件，一匙藥水加進普通一臉盆水即足。</p>
<p>柏油肥皂丨混合二百份柏油與四百份橄欖油，微熱後即滤過，將此濾後之液置水鍋中再熱，以酒精與碳酸鉀之溶</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>液中合此液，因橄欖油屬於Ｏleicacid一種脂肪酸中，故有酸性反應。至此，肥皂將形成，再加百分酒精，最好再帶一點橄欖油，蓋使過剩之　類再中合。然後再將千分甘油帶進。此肥皂含有百分之二十二柏油，可隨需要之多少而將此物增減。若使加二分蒸鎦水則可使盆中邊上不留任何班蹟。</p>
<p>註：蒸溜水一分升即一千立立分（Ｃ·Ｃ０即一公斤，合二·六七九磅，合一·六七七本國十六兩秤一斤。</p>
<p>甘油與水之比重爲一·二七·故一千立方分之甘油爲一·二七公斤或二·一二九本國秤一斤。</p>
<p>醚之比重爲·七二，故千立方分爲·七二公斤，酒精九０七０比重爲，八三四，故千立方分爲·八三四公斤。一公斤等於我國一·六七七斤，讀者可按前所配合之表，按本段之計算。有數種液體可用量杯以代替重衡。</p>
<p>改良社會対論會</p>
<h3>改良兒童之我見</h3>
<p>— 非非</p>
<p>做父母的人，只知道愛他的小孩，不知道愛的方法是怎樣？這是很可惜的啊！</p>
<p>普通地來説：做父母的人們，不顧到兒童身心上要什麽？隨隨便便的地供給，什麽着得暖，吃得飽……就算盡他做父母的義務了。我看，以爲不是這樣，應該着有着的限制，吃有吃的限制。現在我把吃的限制丢開，先來説幾個着一方面的不景氣舉例：</p>
<p>在中國社會裏，做父母的衣服穿得不清潔，這並不是希罕的事情，因爲兒童容易模仿的，不久，自然而然地變成同化了。</p>
<p>冬天到了，做父母的替大孩穿衣服，不明白兒童准和暖，只知道東一件西一件的加上去，穿得如「開路神」般似的，致兒童移動的能力，完全消滅了。而且，身體發育方面，也受很大的阻礙。　　兒童要新的衣服穿，做父母的偶然允許了，究其所做的，那是長衫馬褂之類，穿了文皺皺的，像一個「少年老成」。</p>
<p>不過七八歲的兒童，在這種呆板式的家庭裏生活着，奇異的現象，也疊出不窮了，佋穿了爸爸的鞋子，哥哥的褲子，戴了姊姊的帽子，走來給他的媽媽看，他的母親不去如何如何理解他，反而奬勵很滑稽。</p>
<p>照上面所述，我們做人父母的，不提高自己的人格，又不合現化的潮流了。</p>
<p>歐美各國對於兒童，從前也是這樣的，不過他們出了處梭，斐斯塔洛齊，［福禄倍爾……等：大喊特喊的兒童教育，兒童設施，愛護兒童等等，從此兒童得着一脈福音。</p>
<p>由此思前索後，我們趕快改良起來，也不至於過晚囉丨姑誌之於後：</p>
<p>（一）做兒童衣服的時候，先要問問他喜歡什麽颜色？什麽式樣？什麽材料？由他自己定奪，然後來與他購置。</p>
<p>（二）衣服不要過緊，又不要過寛，比較兒童身體放大一些爲合格。</p>
<p>（三）在日光下之時，衣服可以少穿一些，早晚的氣候較冷，可以多穿一些。　　（四）兒童自己所穿的衣服，脱下來的時候，整理一下，呌他自己收藏起來，一方面可以明瞭自治的精神，一方面可以養成勤儉的習慣。</p>
<p>（五）兒童入學校後，當然是有校服，但未入學校的兒童，可採取國貨商家的中山裝和學生裝。</p>
<p>（六）鞋子方面，向商家購置或自置不妨，要大小方式適當，又合於兒童的心理。</p>
<p>（七）帽子以鴨舌帽爲是，一方面可以蔽遮太陽的光綫。</p>
<p>（八）早晨起來，衣帽鞋襪整理清楚，才可出外。</p>
<p>（九）家庭需要設備，如看衣鏡，衣架衣帚等等,以便整直衣服不週到的地方。</p>
<p>（十）長衫馬褂主義，是兒童不喜歡穿的，那一般十八世紀的父母，還在不停的做，現在，我主張一律打倒牠！</p>

<p>神秘的學府之鐘噹　地響了，方從洗面間出來的一個大學生，揉着兩眼夾了書本匆匆地走向課堂上課去了，但是，上課丨這眞是好苦的事呵！一個鐘頭</p>
<p>的板凳着實有些不好坐，然而不情願坐怎辦呢？上課是要點名啦，缺了五分之一的課便不准參與大考，連學分也拿不到手，豈不是「前功盡棄」？要不得，要不得，不上課究竟是不妥。</p>
<p>於是聰明的大學生仍又懶懒地走向教室，但剛到了走廓，他突然停住了脚步，向迎面走來的Ｋ説道：</p>
<p>「呵！老Ｋ，對勿住請你代到一下，我早點還没吃呢……對勿住！Ｔhankyou……」他説時舉起右手行了一個似是而非的軍禮：隨即泰然地回宿舍去了。</p>
<p>「ＸＸＸＳ教授拿着一張小卡在喊」</p>
<p>着。</p>
<p>「到……」負責的Ｋ隨即應了，但是聲音低了些。</p>
<p>「怎麽樣，誰在下代到？」Ｓ教授故意的問。</p>
<p>「到。誰是代到。ＸＸＸ就是我！」</p>
<p>哼……」Ｓ教授明知内幕，却又莫可如何。</p>
<p>名己點完，Ｓ教教開始講書，講到一個重要的名詞，轉過身向黑板寫字：坐在最後一排的Ｋ，眼見着機會來了，在教授不提防之下走近窗口輕飄地跳出去，一溜烟逃走了。這當兒課堂間不約而同的「　」了一聲，Ｓ教授掉轉頭並没有什麽動静，倒不知大家笑的什麽一回事？</p>
<p>正是Ｓ教授講得津津有味的當兒，「擦……擦……擦……」在課堂間的地板上發出繼續不斷的聲音，繼而一部份人己立起身來，夾着書本要離坐的樣子。　　「怎麽，下課了嗎」？Ｓ教授莫名其妙的問。</p>
<p>「早己下課了，你還没聽見嗎？」己立起身的學生回着。霎時全課堂的人都閧然而散，剩下S教授一個人，當他掬出錶來一看，距下課尚有一刻鐘，不禁連呼咄咄，然亦莫如何，只獨有呆呆地發嘆…………</p>
<p>「逃課，代到，跳窗口，踢地板……」這是大學課堂間特有的動静。天曉得！</p>
<p>隨便談談</p>

<h3>家庭教育</h3>
<p>— 芮禹成</p>
<p>一個富麗堂皇的廠廳裏，陳設著許多光采奪目的飾物，一望而知是多金的人家。上首椅上坐著老夫婦兩人，年紀都有五十以外的模樣。</p>
<p>（老翁）夫人，你不是這樣終日昏昏的就算過日子的！我一生辛苦，好容易挣了這一份家財；青年！他們兒子的名字！動不動便是幾百幾百的做什麽短命的公益！你也得勸勸他，兒子總是你養的！</p>
<p>（老婦）原是的，我也没法阻止他！前幾天向我拿了五百元，説是捐助「東北難民救濟會」的；我雖心裏捨不得，但也己是娶了妻子的人了，還能打還能駡嗎！「兒大不留言」一，教我眞是無法！</p>
<p>正在説著青年，青年匆匆走進，向父母行禮招呼後，坐下來便道：（青年）馬占山的公子來了，他特地來替東北抗日軍勸募糧餉的，我己允許捐助一千元：請父母快給我一張支票！</p>
<p>（老翁老婦）（同聲）什麽？又是一千元嗎？金錢那有這樣容易！</p>
<p>（青年）有國才有家；國破家亡，就是有錢也没用處！現在倭寇己快要滅亡我國了，難得有抗日的志土在拚命地抵抗，我們同爲國民，怎能不幫助他們的經濟呢？假使没有糧餉，教他們豈能打仗？難道眼看著中國亡了，大家都願做亡國奴嗎？</p>
<p>（老翁老婦）管他亡國不亡國，只要我們有錢過日子就是了！國也不是我們一家的，難道老是我們出錢嗎？少爺！我勸你在屋裏享享福，不要在外面這樣胡閙！</p>
<p>（青年）同你這些老糊塗虫説不通，我到錢莊裏去付一千塊好！（説罷起身就走，老夫妻只望著他的前影嘆氣。）</p>
<p>（老翁）這樣的長遠下去，家裏的財産出不夠他化！非要想一個法子不可……（低頭沈思）</p>
<p>（老婦）我倒有一個法子：（説著四顧無人，就低聲接著道：）不如勸他吸上鴉片烟，包管教他出去他也懶得出去了，憑我們家道，只要他安分守業，一生一世也不愁的啊！</p>
<p>（老翁）（得意洋洋，哈哈大笑，）對…對…對…不過就怕他不上圈套，如何是好呢！</p>
<p>（老婦）這個你放心！我去找一個縹緻的妓女回來，慢慢地引誘他，勸解他：先用白美人計，後用黑美人計：你看可好！</p>
<p>（老翁）好…好…好…就這樣辦：可是要瞞着媳婦才行呢！</p>
<p>（老婦）我來把媳支出去，教她的表姊把她接去過幾天就是了。</p>
<p>老夫婦計劃己定，歡喜得不可形容。</p>

<p>開塲白</p>
<h3>「百里鑼」</h3>
<p>本報電影專刋發刋［之初、照例應有一段發刋詞、譬如戲臺開塲、必須有跳加官的官的一齣喜劇、電影院裏是没有跳加官的、但是亦有與跳加官性質相同的一段照例音樂、這種音樂呌做「百里鑼」Ｐrelude、這「百里鑼」三字是譯音，可以説有意味、亦可以説毫無意味的、</p>
<p>「百里鑼」有什麽用意呢、第一種用意是告訴人家、影戲快要開映了、請大家安静些、第二種用意是藉此可以提起觀衆的精神、並且使他們很愉快的去領略劇情、説句笑話、譬如丈夫和妻子、或是妻子與丈夫、在家裏淘了氣、跑到影戲院裏來、餘憤未消、氣咻咻的悶坐在影戲院裏、等到「百里鑼」一響、心就平了、氣就消了、所以在這將開未開塲之先、幾分鐘的音樂、居然使他換了一副心平氣静的態度，去領會劇中的興趣，或年者看完影戲之後回到家中、言歸於好、下次携手同來、影戲院中平白地添了許多生意、家庭間省却了無數煩惱、豈不就是那「百里鑼」一奏之功、可是又要聲明、倘使摩登男女、同蒞影院、在那萬盞燈光之下、不便交頭接耳、互通情愫、等到「百里鑼」一響、心怦怦然、可喜銀暉黯澹、即在目前、不久便可握手無罰目瞪不禁、那就誤會了「百里鑼」的原意了、這種觀念，是本刋斷然難以相容的、因爲本刋提倡電影雖屬游藝性質，却也是與他種仙樣刋物微有不同、譬如孔夫子打哈哈、即在嬉皮笑臉之中還有些尊嚴存在、再以申報年齡而論、他己是六十餘歲的老人、雖然混迹少年之塲、却也不便過於放蕩、這一點希望讀者（即是看客）以及投稿諸君、（即是角色）大家加以注意原諒、但是題目亦要認清、「百里鑼」自身並非正戲、正戲還在後面、本報爲了這電影附刋、籌備己經數月、拉攏了一個班底、還很過得去、還有幾位名票、慨允粉墨登塲、可是話又説差了、這是電影塲、不是戲圈、祇好説本院有好片子、明星衆多、號召力决不至於太乏了、鄙人忝居編者之職、不得不像跳加官似的、先奏起「百里鑼」來、</p>

<p>老爺兵在卡爾登公映了三天了、今天我纔來作評、不怕被人家笑作明日黃花嗎、不過因爲這張片子、有許多人</p>
<h3>熱的女郎回來了</h3>
<p>熱的女郎克萊拉寳、與影戲界久别之後、現在又回來了、要在狐狸公司拍演了一張片子、名字呌做Ｇali</p>
<p>HerSavage、中文片名因片子尚未到、不知其内容、未便代譯、大概係很興奮的一齣影戲吧、據説克萊拉寳久别重逢之後、己變了一個人、從前她完全不願爲任何環境所束縛、放蕩形骸之外、現在據説莊重得多了、她的深閨秘事、亦不隨便講給人聽了、誠然女兒十八變、克萊拉寳又怎能逃出這個定例呢？</p>
<p>批評説不好、所以我也凑丨下熱閙、談一談、　　這張片子大約只有六千尺左右、故事是很簡單的、只在這平平淡淡的小故事中、來找一些很有趣的笑料、</p>
<p>以我個人看、這張片子的劇旨有兩種、第一是形容一種社會上所謂的交際花、她本人雖没有在銀幕中露面、而給人的印象、己非常深了、第二是説一個男子爲失戀而消極、是很大的錯誤、困爲有許多時候、根本談不到愛、又何來得失呢、所以自始至終用這一個虚擬的女子作了中心人物、她的照片、一見再見、處處不脱此點、正是片中一貫不散的好處、這也就是一片的靈魂、</p>
<p>佈景的確不大好、不過沙漠的背景、還不差、鐵訂只是作一張影片結束的介紹物、並不吃緊、而兩人立功受賞也並没有攝出、只到擒來酋長爲止、不落大團圓大富貴的俗套、</p>
<p>我並不説這張子一定多好、我只説牠决不壞、因爲前十年的影片是述事寫實、現在我們所求於電影的、是藝術和寓意、即使超脱一般的大藝術作品、如城市之光、尚不能完全合理、陸克裴斯開登吏是這樣、那麽我們又怎能以不合格三字來深責勞萊哈代呢、</p>
<p>這次卡而登配的副片子也有一介紹的價值、即如那一段五彩歌舞片（原名Ｂaby</p>
<p>Follies）完全由十二三歲以下童星、作舞台劇、其中有三個年約六七歲的小寳貝、説話説不清、一種自然天眞、可愛</p>
<p>之至、居然載歌載舞、引起了全塲觀衆的鼓掌、還有一張有聲狗片、把悲歡離合表演神化、由這兩殺小小劇片、也可以證明美國電影的進步、把小孩子、和狗都訓練到如此、</p>

<h3>摩登三女子（星）</h3>
<p>説了這一個名字、大凡電影迷都知道是聯華的一齣將演而未演的名片、</p>
<p>其實片不在乎名不名、先得看其肉容、這張片子、雖在上月底完全攝完、但是剪接還没動手、試演還没有、又怎能説牠好壞呢？</p>
<p>不過至少牠的劇旨是現代青年人的南針、牠顯示人們眞正的摩登是什麽、把一般女子誤解虚榮和交際爲摩登而得的失敗描寫出來、至終曲一個村姑而得了勝利、因爲這村姑才是實在了解摩登二字眞義的人、</p>
<p>這村姑是阮玲玉演的、對手當然是金焰了、表演方面、我雖然看過她們攝片、然而我决不武斷説好、至少以她們的聲譽、我可以説一聲「還靠得住吧」</p>
<p>我介紹牠的原因、是因爲現化青年觀念的錯誤、牠可以矯正了、再則由經騐説來、聯華劇旨多半還能趨合時代、</p>

<h3>中國人與中國電影陳大悲</h3>
<p>在軍閥時代的北京城裏、我常聽得政學商界中洋氣十足朋友們…………口口聲聲説中國電影幼稚得可憐、不值得一看、到了青天白日的南京城裏、情形還是差不多、頭等影戲院裏放映的多半還是外國影片、提倡國産影片的無非是些窮學生、離社會較高的人們照樣的把國産影片一筆抺煞、甚至於武斷着説中國影片事業是永遠没有希望的了、那一種怡然自得的旁觀態度常常引我懷疑到他們的國籍問題、因爲、現在世界上、無論那一國的人總没有這樣慷慨大方的、</p>
<p>誠然、中國影片不如外國影片、但是、所以不如的原因在那裏呢、是攝影和發光的機械不精良嗎、當然的這是事實、慚愧得很、自有製片事業以來、中國人從來没有自己製造過一架攝影機、連一尺膠片都没有自己製造過、老實説、所有一切攝製國的機械、連零件都是由外洋運來的、如若説機械不精良是國片不如外片的緣故、那也只好怪我們自己中國人不争氣、年年兵連禍結、弄得民窮財盡、百業凋敝、影響到影業界、那裏還有整千整萬的錢去買外國最新發明的攝影機和打光燈一類的東西呢、</p>
<p>但是機械的不良並不是國片的致命傷、因爲毁既然是金錢可以買得來的、而且商品不像軍械、斷没有秘而不宣的巧妙用法不許買主學會的、只要我們的影片公司有充裕的資本、甚麽新發明的攝影機械、我們都可以坐享其成、連攝影技師也何妨由外國聘來、</p>
<p>那麽是編劇缺乏人材嗎、是導演和表演的人材不如外國人嗎、這或許是事實、目今全世界影業最發達的國家、誰不知道是美國、美國的製片事業己有四十餘年的歷史而我們中國至多只有十多年、一個十來歲的先天不足的小學生如何能和一位銅拳鐵臂的大力士比賽體力呢、比賽己經是錯誤的了、比賽而失敗、這個瘦弱學生的親戚朋友坐在旁觀席上向他大呌其倒好、試問這些親戚朋友們還有人心麽！唉！</p>

<h3>The Democratic Party's Election Prospects and the Outlook for the World Economy</h3>
<p>The U.S. presidential election at the beginning of this month is fast approaching. According to intelligence and predictions from various sources, the current President Hoover's downfall is almost inevitable, and the Democratic Party's Roosevelt's election will be a future certainty. Whether this prediction is accurate, we cannot be sure, but today Hoover's position is not only squeezed by the Democratic Party or other opposition leftist parties, but even the Republican Party's left wing has largely risen to attack him. Therefore, Hoover's instability is almost obviously the trend, and the rise of the Democratic Party also has the momentum of a storm about to break.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party's biggest criticism of Hoover is his "incitement of speculative illusions." Considering the recent effects of Hoover's economic propaganda strategy, the market did improve for a while. However, it soon returned to being a bubble. However, this is the accumulation of the current stage of capitalism. Initially, it could not be improved immediately through Hoover's active strategies. Therefore, although Hoover's inability to formulate extreme strategies has been heavily criticized by the Democratic Party, whether the Democratic Party will be able to switch to another strategy after being elected and break Hoover's current false prosperity is a question that we dare not absolutely deny its impossibility, but it can also be said that it is by no means an easy task. Because the most important of Hoover's active strategies today are the Glass-Steagall Act (currency inflation policy). Glass and Steagall are Democrats. At the same time, most of the leaders active in the U.S. government today are Democrats. For example, the president of the Financial Reconstruction Corporation, Paul Mellon, is a Democrat. In addition, former Speaker of the House Colthurst Paul, who passed the currency inflation policy proposal, is also an important member of the Democratic Party. Therefore, even if the Democratic Party can be elected today, its economic policy in the United States will not change in any way. As a result, regardless of the tariff issue or the currency issue, the Democratic Party will inevitably repeat the old tune of the Republican Party. This is almost certain.</p>
<p>The three major incurable diseases of today's world economic problems are: first, the tariff barriers of various countries; second, the world currency problem (the fluctuation of the gold standard); and third, war debts. The first two have a mutual cause-and-effect relationship. Next year's World Economic Conference has included these two as major topics. However, the solution to the tariff issue depends entirely on whether Britain and the United States have the courage to make concessions. Now that the Democratic Party will inevitably follow in Hoover's footsteps, it can almost be asserted that this cancer will eventually be a cancer. As for the solution to the currency problem, it takes the tariff issue as a prerequisite. If the tariff is not resolved one day, how can the fluctuation of currency be spared? As for the war debt issue, it is a triangular relationship between some American people, the American government, and Europe. Whether the war debt can be cancelled depends entirely on the will of the American people. The U.S. government cannot definitively say a word. Therefore, even if Roosevelt replaces Hoover, his attitude towards war debts will not change the current situation.</p>
<p>In short, today's world panic is a phenomenon that should exist in the current stage of capitalism. It cannot be cured by a prescription that "treats the head when the head aches." The alternation of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party is nothing more than a change of soup without changing the medicine. Therefore, wanting to support the rise of the Democratic Party to save the United States and save the world is really difficult.</p>
<p>We believe that in order to restore today's world prosperity, the current bad system must be revised. Then tariffs and currencies will not cause problems, and war debts can also be resolved. Otherwise, no matter how the politics of the capitalist kingdom of America change, or the World Economic Conference is convened hundreds of times, the panic will eventually be a panic.</p>

<h3>Tang's Troops Shot Down Seven Japanese Planes</h3>
<p>(Beiping) At the beginning of the month, the Japanese army used five divisions and more than a hundred planes to launch a fierce attack on Tonghua and indiscriminately bombed it. Tang's troops ran out of ammunition and were isolated, abandoning 16 counties including Tonghua and Huanren and retreated to Antu, Fusong, and Mengjiang, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. On the 13th, Tang led Gao Boxiang, the first brigade commander, and more than 5,000 people to supervise the battle in Hengdaohezi. Because the Japanese artillery was fierce and our ammunition was insufficient, they retreated. Brigade Commander Gao died in battle. Tang still bravely commanded and shot down seven Japanese planes in Sutuyaya and other places. More than 400 Japanese soldiers died. After three days and nights of bloody battles, the Japanese sent Ma Longxiang to the troops to persuade them to surrender, promising a million Japanese gold coins. Tang supervised Ma's imprisonment and encouraged the soldiers to fight to the death. Tang's left eye was injured. (31st Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Sui Ning Conference Has a Chance to Be Realized</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui and Deng Tian Negotiate and Express Approval</p>
<p>The Northern Route Has Ceased Fire, the Central and Eastern Routes Are in a Standoff</p>
<p>(Chengdu) After the 21st Army stationed in Jiangjin, Yongchuan, and Dazu, they are now approaching separately. On the 30th, they also used airplanes to reconnaissance Rongchang, Longchang, Hejiang and other counties, and planned to drop four boxes of incendiary bombs. Liu Wenhui is unwilling to engage in combat, causing suffering to the people. He has ordered Zhang Qingping's division to retreat accordingly to value the local area. Also, since Yang Sen telegraphed Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao in Suining to meet, the voice of Suining gathering has risen again for a time. Everyone expects that if Liu Xiangzhen is for Sichuan and can obey the central government's orders, it may be possible to realize it. It is heard that Liu Wenyao has expressed his approval and intends to supplement the deficiencies in the principles of governing Sichuan mentioned in the telegrams of Tang Shizun and others on the 12th. Also, Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao have been consulting with Liu Wenhui on Sichuan affairs for several days, which is satisfactory. There is also a rumor that they have telegraphed Yang Sen to come to the province. (31st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Hankou said that the various troops of Luo and Li in Sichuan have been advancing forward from Suining without pursuing them. Liu Wenhui is doing his best to shorten the defense area in northern Sichuan. The war there may come to an end. After that, the center of the war will be shifted to eastern Sichuan.

<p>(Hankou) It is heard that Liu Xiang will depart for the front, and a garrison headquarters will be established in Chongqing with Yang Guozhen and Li Gengu as the commander and deputy commander, respectively. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Sichuan war still relies on Deng and Tian to have a pivotal position. In addition to ordering the two Lius to stop military action, Jiang also hopes that Deng and others will serve as a buffer to prevent it from expanding. Currently, Jianyang is heavily guarded by Deng and Tian, ​​separating the armies of the two Lius. Chen Hongwen's entire division has been recovered by Deng and will no longer be dispatched by Liu Wenhui. Liu Cunhou and Yang Sen have also sent troops to mobilize in the name of armed mediation, and it is rumored that the generals will force Liu Wenhui to hand over power and retreat to western Sichuan, and support Tian Songyao as the chairman of the province. They also hope that Zhang Qun will enter Sichuan. Liu Wenhui's side also expressed support for Zhang Chuan. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hankou) There has been no change in the Sichuan war for several days. Jiangjin, Yongchuan, and Tongnan have been occupied by Liu Xiang's troops. Currently, the northern route has entered a state of ceasefire, and the central and eastern routes are in a stalemate and fierce fighting. Liu Wenhui decided to gradually shorten the line of defense due to excessive defense, with the right route concentrated in Luzhou, the central route concentrated in Dazu, and the left route concentrated in Anyue. If necessary, Hechuan will also be abandoned. (31st Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>The National Government Instructs Yan Huiquing on Opinions on the Report</h3>
<p>Expresses Understanding of the League of Nations' Hard Work</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign sources, the government's instructions to Representative Yan have arrived in Geneva regarding China's opinions on the investigation report. China deeply understands the League of Nations' mediation efforts. The Chinese government still has concerns about whether the Japanese side can comply with the principle of international justice. The Chinese government has always abided by the Washington Nine-Power Agreement, the Non-War Pact, and several resolutions of the League of Nations. Now the report's proposal for resolving the Northeast issue is also entirely based on not violating the above-mentioned international agreements. Therefore, China has no different opinions. On the contrary, the Chinese government will never recognize anything that contradicts the above-mentioned agreements. It is now heard that the Chinese delegation will temporarily refrain from making unnecessary sophistry on the Japanese side's rebuttal of the report. After the Japanese side submits its opinions, it will base on the law and the facts to make a solemn counter-rebuttal. Therefore, Yan will not submit the various reasons for the Chinese government's instructions to the delegation at once, but will express them separately at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>(31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign sources, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is considering whether the postponement of the League of Nations' discussion of the report for a week will have any impact on us. Therefore, it has no intention of applying for an early discussion for the time being. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The three representatives in Europe, Yan, Gu, and Guo, telegraphed Foreign Minister Luo on the 31st, asking him to convey to Han and Liu in Shandong, and the two Lius in Sichuan, to be mindful of the country's critical situation, to stop internal strife immediately, so as to avoid the Japanese side from taking advantage of it to make propaganda that damages our international credibility and benefits our diplomatic efforts. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Sichuan-Shandong strife, there has been much ridicule internationally. Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan has telegraphed them three times with extreme sincerity to persuade them to cease strife. Liu Xiang and Han Fuqu have successively telegraphed Luo, saying that the responsibility of righteousness should be accepted with sincerity. (31st Special Telegram)</p>

It has specially decided to hold a meeting in Beijing on the 1st to discuss everything. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Dai Jitao and Others Continue to Discuss the Aftermath of the Sichuan Situation</h3>
<p>Zhang Qun Arrives in Beijing at Dai's Invitation</p>
<p>Dai Reports at the Commemoration Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government held the 50th Commemoration Week on the morning of the 31st. Those who attended were Dai Fuxian, Chu Minyi, Li Ciwen, Ye Chucong, Zhang Daofan, Gu Zhenggang, Xiao Jishan, Huang Jichen, Zheng Zhannan, Ju Zheng, Zhang Qun, Xiao Zhongzhen, Wang Qi, Wang Boling, Yu Jingtang, Chen Lifu, Xie Zuomin, Zeng Kuoqing, Tang Youren, and staff and guests, totaling about 600 people. Ju Zheng chaired the meeting, and Dai Fuxian reported on "Solutions to the Sichuan Incident," briefly stating that since the Sichuan war broke out, not only the people of Sichuan, but also the people of the whole country have been uneasy. The central government attaches great importance to this matter at a time when it is united in resisting foreign aggression and striving for construction. It seeks opinions from all parties, especially the opinions of the people of Sichuan, in order to find a solution. All parties are willing for the central government to decide on a perfect solution. In fact, the central government's solution has already been decided and does not need to be discussed and studied now. Just reread the National Government's order to Sichuan affairs on November 7th of the 17th year of the Republic of China, and you can know that there are definite solutions to Sichuan's military affairs, internal affairs, finance, finance, education, civil groups, and justice. All are centered on the word "peace." There is no need to publish a new plan today. It is enough to issue this order again today, word for word. Premier Sun Yat-sen telegraphed the Sichuan military and political authorities from Shanghai in September of the 10th year of the Republic of China, advising the people of Sichuan to abolish war and revitalize industry. This telegram is indeed the fundamental solution to Sichuan Province. The ten</p>
<h3>Northeastern Disaster Victims Enter the Pass in Droves</h3>
<p>▲ Sell the Leather Goods They Bring at Low Prices</p>
<p>Since the Japanese imperialists invaded the Northeast and encouraged the puppets to organize a false country, the arbitrary taxation and tyranny were like tigers and wolves. Ordinary people had no way to make a living. Therefore, they all fled into the pass. At this time, the weather is getting colder, and they have no clothes or food, lack assistance, and have no way to appeal. The only property they bring is some leather goods. Therefore, they are eager to sell them in order to make a living. This matter was heard by the special commissioner of the Shanghai Lao Xiangtai Leather Goods Bureau, who was saddened by it and bought them at low prices and transported them to Shanghai for cheap sale. The price is several times lower than usual, and the goods are indeed genuine and top-quality.</p>
<p>The order of the 7th year of the Republic of China is a temporary solution. If the people of Sichuan can thoroughly realize and strongly support the above two solutions, the lack of awareness of a few soldiers will not affect the peace of Sichuan Province. Premier Sun Yat-sen often said that with the wealth of Sichuan, the people of Sichuan are not afraid of having nothing to do. Even with the current commercial situation, if Sichuan is peaceful, activities such as shipping, banking, exchange, insurance, and warehouses will be enough to make money. As for industry and mining, there is no need to mention them. Sichuan's wealth accounts for several percent of the country's wealth. At a time when the country is working hard to build and resist foreign aggression, we cannot allow the bad situation in Sichuan to continue and damage the country's resources. When I went to Chengdu in the 11th year of the Republic of China, I lived there for eight months and saw four wars break out. If you don't seek to improve yourself and want others to ask you to seek improvement, it is impossible. I hope that the people of Sichuan will automatically realize and support the central government's proposal. (31st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Qun arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 31st at the invitation of Dai Jitao to discuss solutions to the Sichuan situation. According to Zhao Jia, regarding the disposal of the Sichuan situation, in terms of temporary solutions, we should act in accordance with the ten articles of the Outline for Governing Sichuan promulgated by the National Government of the 17th year of the Republic of China. In terms of fundamental solutions, we should act in accordance with Premier Sun Yat-sen's telegram to the generals in Sichuan in the 11th year of the Republic of China, taking the abolition of civil war and the revitalization of industry as the principle. The various armies in Sichuan, regardless of their leaders or second-tier generals, should take obedience to the central government's orders as a prerequisite. The second step is to plan for the implementation of a plan to govern Sichuan. As long as the people inside and outside Sichuan unanimously support the central government's orders, no matter how reckless the soldiers are, a valid method can be obtained. On the evening of the 30th, Dai hosted a banquet for Zhang Qun, Shi Qingyang, and other important Sichuan figures in his residence. There were detailed discussions on the steps to stop the Sichuan war and various political aftermath issues. (31st Special Telegram)</p>

Chinese control many large businesses and are present everywhere. China and Siam have been friendly since ancient times. Many overseas Chinese can now speak fluent Siamese, and many Siamese can also speak Chinese. Even senior officials speak Shantou dialect. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish between Chinese and Siamese. After paying head tax at the immigration bureau, Chinese are regarded as Siamese.

<h3>Important Foreign Telegram: Gu Weijun's Broadcast Speech to the United States</h3>
<h3>Titled "The Relationship Between China and World Prosperity"</h3>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 30th: The International Wireless Radio Lecture Association has invited Gu Weijun, the Chinese Minister to France, to give a speech to the American public on "The Relationship Between China and World Peace and Prosperity." The association was founded by Leilson Morris, the former US Minister to Sweden. At the invitation of the association, Gu gave a speech in English at the Paris Colonial Wireless Radio Station today, which was broadcast to the United States. The main points of his speech were as follows: "In 1912, China overthrew the monarchy and leaped from a millennia-old empire to become the first republic in Asia. Twenty years have passed since the success of the revolution. This fundamental transformation has generated countless difficult problems, but if given time and without external interference, its future is full of hope. This is what we deeply believe in. We have two goals: internally, to build a unified and strong republic; externally, to seek world peace and prosperity with all countries, near and far. China is rich in resources. If it is developed and the purchasing power of its 450 million people is increased, goods from various countries will surely sell well in China. From the perspective of international trade, this is a uniquely good market. Therefore, China's ability to develop in an orderly manner is greatly related to world peace and prosperity. Conversely, if China cannot make its own decisions, this huge market will be difficult to open to the world. History has shown that once territories formerly belonging to China are ceded to others, the borders are tightly locked, and trade is no longer free. The principle of equal treatment for the industry and commerce of all countries is abandoned in fact, even if not in name. Therefore, whether the Open Door Policy can be maintained in China depends entirely on whether China can be independent and whether China can be free from any foreign interference or control. China's future is not only related to the prosperity of all countries, but also to world peace, and the latter is even more important. Without world peace, there is no way for countries to prosper. The reason why the Manchurian problem is so serious and has ominous signs is that if this problem cannot be resolved quickly according to the principle of China's territorial integrity, there is no hope for prosperity in the Pacific region, and by extension, there is no hope for lasting world peace." We should pay attention to the fact that Gu explained that China's sovereignty in Manchuria is linked to the interests of all countries trading with China. China has repeatedly protested by citing the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League of Nations Covenant. However, because his audience was a nation that particularly valued preserving the Chinese market, his speech focused on the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Open Door Policy on which it was based.</p>
<h3>Singapore to be Changed to Non-Free Port</h3>
<h3>Major Blow to Japanese Trade</h3>
<h3>America Demands Maritime Freedom in Wartime</h3>
<p>▲ Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 31st: Singapore, a free port for ships entering and leaving, has frequent trade with various countries. Recently, the British government has considered reforming its dependencies, intending to levy tariffs on imported goods. It goes without saying that the trade of various countries will be affected, especially Japan's major exports such as cotton cloth and matches, which will be greatly affected.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 30th: A certain prominent American figure made a statement to a reporter from the Paris "Petit Journal," the last paragraph of which reads: "In the Pacific, the Japanese navy is based in Sasebo, and the British are based in Singapore. These are all extremely difficult problems. In addition, there is the issue of maritime freedom. The United States wants to ensure that in the future, all warships will not be allowed to inspect, capture, or sink the merchant ships of neutral countries. This is known to everyone. The United States regards this requirement as a fundamental principle of international law, but this issue has been discussed for a long time in legal terms without any results. There is a reason why President Hoover ordered his disarmament representative Davis not to involve the issue of maritime freedom during the negotiations.</p>

<h3>Important Foreign Telegram Two: Zhang Jinghui Goes to Japan with a Traitorous Mission</h3>
<h3>Pretending to Accompany and Observe Autumn Maneuvers</h3>
<h3>In Reality, Negotiating a Military Treaty</h3>
<h3>Xie (Traitor) Leaves Japan and Returns to Dalian</h3>
<p>▲ Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 31st: Zhang Jinghui, the puppet minister of the puppet state, and Zhang Haipeng, along with five others, are scheduled to depart from Changchun for Japan on November 1st. It is reported that Zhang Jinghui's trip is nominally to accompany and observe autumn maneuvers, but in reality, he carries a traitorous mission. Although the content is kept secret, it is reported that the main items of the military treaty案that Zhang carries are: (1) the locations and number of Japanese troops stationed in the three northeastern provinces; (2) the training and control of the puppet army are in the hands of Japan; (3) the permanent defense of the Russian-Manchurian border; (4) the manufacturing and management rights of military supplies are controlled by the Japanese; (5) the specific measures for the defense of North China; (6) the special treatment of Japanese officers in the puppet army, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Kobe, 31st: Xie (Traitor) Jieshi boarded a ship here at 10:00 this morning to return to Dalian. Many people saw him off. Xie came here to express the "Manchurian State's" gratitude to Japan for recognizing it. While in Tokyo, he discussed the problems between Russia and "Manchuria" with the Russian ambassador.</p>
<h3>Saltazawa Promoted to Lieutenant General for Meritorious Service in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 31st: The annual promotion and transfer list for Japanese naval personnel will be officially announced on December 1st after final approval. Rear Admiral Saltazawa, who commanded the Japanese fleet and marines during the initial outbreak of war in Shanghai in February this year, will be promoted to Lieutenant General and transferred to commander of the Zhenhai Naval Port.</p>
<h3>Japan Opposes the American and Russian Participation in Discussion of Lytton Report</h3>
<p>▲ Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 31st: The League of Nations Administrative Council and the Provisional General Assembly are about to open. Not to mention the small countries, even the major powers such as Britain and France are very welcome to Russia and the United States to participate. However, Japan firmly wants to cover the eyes and ears of the people of the world with one hand, and does not want countries outside the League of Nations to participate. The Soviet Union's feelings towards Japan once seemed harmonious, but it is doubtful what attitude it will take at that time. As for the United States, it has always been dissatisfied with the actions of the Japanese army in Manchuria, so participating in the discussion of the Lytton Report is naturally unfavorable to Japan. Therefore, Japan expressed a tough attitude and absolutely does not recognize the participation of the United States and Russia in the discussion.</p>
<h3>Japan Uses Tough Military Reduction Policy to Restrain Manchurian Case</h3>
<p>▲ Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 31st: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered Ito Jushi to negotiate with various small countries such as Spain and Switzerland in Geneva, using certain conditions to ease the small countries' upholding of justice in the League of Nations. Now Ambassador Matsudaira is contacting Foreign Minister Simon of Britain and Davis, the American representative, on the issue of military reduction. The Japanese side insists that if Britain and the United States insist on opposing Japan's Manchurian policy, Japan will oppose the military reduction案of Britain and the United States, using the issue of military reduction to restrain the Sino-Japanese dispute. According to reports from Japanese representatives to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan's strategy has achieved considerable results, and the final negotiations will be held when Matsuoka arrives in Geneva.</p>

<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Washington, 30th: Today, the American officialdom learned of the opinions on the new French disarmament plan, believing that France knows the position of the United States regarding foreign disputes, and should not propose using American troops in European disputes. Therefore, it is believed that when Herriot summarized the new disarmament proposals in the French Parliament last week, he definitely focused on Europe. The full text of his proposal has not yet been obtained, but American officialdom believes that Herriot should be able to express this in his local conventions (i.e., regional conventions), because it is certain that the American people will never agree to allocate American troops to international armies. In addition, it is also believed that France may be willing to discuss replacing the consultation convention proposed by Herriot with the Kellogg-Briand Pact, because the Non-War Pact already has clear provisions for this kind of consultation, and since the pact has been signed by so many countries, it seems unnecessary to conclude another new treaty. Every view on the proposal for a professional army is enough to show that the original intention of the French plan is only for Europe, because the United States does not have a compulsory military service army in peacetime. However, the American officialdom still strongly advocates that President Hoover's disarmament plan is practical and feasible. Many proposals in Europe often contain articles that reiterate previously agreed-upon plans, which are just redundant.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 31st: The British government and the public do not want to discuss the new French disarmament plan announced by French Prime Minister Herriot in the House of Commons last week until the full text is published. The Times stated that the new plan has a difficult effort to correct some points raised by former French Prime Minister Tardieu that were opposed by people, so Britain should give it sympathetic consideration. The new plan contains many elements needed for disarmament. The Daily Telegraph criticized the plan as complex and will make Britain's obligations under Article 16 of the International Covenant and the Locarno Treaty even greater, and Britain maintains the right to act according to its own judgment on this obligation. However, other proposals in the new plan are quite valuable and can serve as the basis for discussions in Geneva. Financial News stated that the new plan has abstract value, but cannot be accepted by other countries. The newspaper and several other newspapers advocate that Britain put forward a practical plan. According to a Washington dispatch, American officialdom seems optimistic about the French plan.</p>
<h3>Baben Expresses that France and Germany Should be Friendly</h3>
<h3>Saying That France's Fear of German Military Preparations is a Big Mistake</h3>
<h3>Saving Germany's Economic Sickness Will Also Benefit France</h3>
<p>▲ Havas, Argentine Capital, 30th: The German correspondent of the local "National Daily" paid a visit to German Prime Minister Baben, and talked about the German-French issue. Baben declared, "France deeply fears Germany's military preparations, which is a big mistake. French public opinion misunderstands its psychology, because German youth organizations have all kinds of organizations, without knowing that German youth groups are no different from American militias and the French Veterans Association. Germany's economy is declining and its spirit is depressed. If it can be rescued and its chronic illness is cured, it will benefit France and the whole world." The reporter then asked whether Franco-German friendship was possible. Baben replied, "I think friendship between the two countries can be realized, and it is also necessary to be friendly. In recent years, there have been various major outstanding cases between the two countries, which were initially considered impossible to handle, but were eventually resolved one by one, such as the withdrawal of troops from the Rhine and the issue of compensation. Since previous things can be resolved, why is it uniquely impossible to resolve the issue of equal rights to national defense at present? The freedom and equality of individuals are what France first advocated. The relationship between nations should be resolved based on the principle of equality. The reason is the same. Therefore, it is impossible to reach an understanding with France on this level."</p>

<h3>Unemployed in Britain Hold Second Demonstration in London</h3>
<h3>Playing the Communist Party Anthem in the Torrential Rain</h3>
<h3>Police Strictly Guarded but Fortunately No Trouble Occurred</h3>
<p>▲ Havas, London, 30th: This afternoon, a large team of "Hunger Walkers" held an unprecedented demonstration in Trafalgar Square. The police department took extraordinary measures in advance to prevent chaos. Large teams of police officers were stationed around the square. All public institutions, departments, and royal palaces near Downing Street, the prime minister's residence, and key locations were closely guarded by the police. There were also a large number of police reserve members gathered nearby ready to depart. There were also volunteer police officers cooperating with the formal police, just like the old days during the European War. The demonstration was able to pass peacefully thanks to these preventive measures and the rain all day long. Only in a certain place near the royal palace, hundreds of curious people gathered to avoid the rain, and were slightly冲撞by the mounted police. Before the demonstration, it was said that 100,000 comrades would participate, but in the end only about 25,000 people actually participated. Although the leaders tried to instigate the crowd to rush to the royal palace, smash the glass windows, and cause trouble, no one listened. Several demonstrators gave speeches one after another under the monument to Admiral Nelson. At this time, demonstrators came from different directions, continuously for two hours. Amidst the rumbling of drums, the Communist Party anthem was played with喇叭. Each group of demonstrators was accompanied by police officers on both sides, either walking or riding. There were also thousands of police officers surrounding the square several times to prevent accidents. At 4:30 in the afternoon, the demonstrators lined up under the supervision of the police and proceeded to the nearby prosperous streets. Around 5:00, all the demonstrators had left the square. As the demonstration was coming to an end, several minor incidents occurred. When the police chased the demonstrators in郤林十字街, they used clubs to injure many people. There was also a conflict at the recruitment office, which was changed to a special police office. Several groups of demonstrators insulted the volunteer police in the office in various ways, and the police dispersed them. Apart from this, there was nothing else. When the demonstrators dispersed, the police directed the order extremely well.</p>

<h3>Alessandri Has Hope</h3>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Santiago, 30th: The Republic of Chile has stopped its plan to change presidents every week today, and formally elected Alessandri, the leader of the Radical Party, as president. According to the latest election report, Alessandri has steadily won a majority of votes. The Radical Party in Chile has a slightly different meaning than the so-called radicals in Europe.

<h3>Road Staff Involved Sentenced to Heavy Sentences</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Moscow, 30th: One of the road staff arrested for the recent Black Sea express train accident has been sentenced to death, and the rest have been sentenced to imprisonment for varying terms.

<h3>US Intercepts Smuggling Speedboat</h3>
<h3>The Truth About the Strange Ship in the Pacific is Clear</h3>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Newport (Rhode Island): It is learned that the US Coast Guard has captured a high-speed gasoline boat, whose shape is very similar to a destroyer. It can be seen that the strange ship seen by the US Navy must have been a 1932-style smuggling boat. The boat looks exactly like a destroyer borrowed by the Navy Department to the Coast Guard, so the authorities did not pay attention to it at first. After investigating the location of the Coast Guard and Navy ships, they suspected that there should be no destroyers appearing along the coast, so they investigated it. The boat also knew that it was being investigated by the authorities and immediately fled, but was eventually caught by the authorities. A large batch of whiskey worth 50,000 yuan was seized. It is said that it came from St. John, North Florida. The owner of the boat and the crew, a total of nine people, were arrested and charged with violating the customs law.</p>

<h3>Important News: The Jiaodong Incident is Generally Resolved</h3>
<p>▲ The Korean Army Will Withdraw to the West Bank of the Wei River Within Ten Days</p>
<p>▲ Liu's Troops Will Not Leave Shandong Until the Korean Army Has Completely Withdrawn</p>
<p>▲ Supervised by Jiang Bocheng, Xiong Bin, and Gao Lingbai</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Regarding the Jiaodong Incident, since Chairman Chiang sent Zhang Fang to Jinan to meet with Han Fuju, after a discussion between Zhang and Han yesterday, there are already signs of a solution. Han obeyed Chiang's opinion and agreed to withdraw the provincial army. Yantai and Longkou will be garrisoned by the navy so that Liu Zhennian's troops can leave Shandong within a certain period. Zhang telegraphed Chiang and He Yingqin last night to report and request instructions on everything. After receiving the reply and approval, it can be put into practice. Jiang Bocheng also arrived in Jinan from Beijing this morning (29th) to meet with Zhang Fang and Han. All the military and political dignitaries went to the station to welcome him. After Jiang Bocheng got off the train at nine o'clock, he went to the Jiaoji Hotel with Han to discuss with Zhang Fang for a long time. I then went to visit and Jiang said that there was a solution to the matter, but the reply from the commander-in-chief and Minister He had not arrived, so it could not be considered a decision. At noon, the reply could arrive in Jinan, and Han, Jiang, Zhang, and others made another discussion, and it was generally resolved. In the afternoon, at three o'clock, I visited Jiang again at the Central Bank. According to him, the Jiaodong Incident has been generally resolved. Chairman Han always followed the orders of the Central Government and Chairman Chiang, and under the dual consideration of the Central Government's prestige and local security, a solution was agreed upon and implemented step by step: (1) Date of withdrawal: The Military and Political Department ordered by telegraph that the original order required the Third Route Army and the militia transferred from other counties to withdraw to the west of the Wei River before Jian (28th). Later, Chairman Han telegraphed me, requesting the Central Government to consider extending the time, because the time was pressing and he was afraid that he would not be able to withdraw in time. I forwarded the telegram to Minister He, and then received a reply from Minister He, saying, "As long as Xiang Fangxiong can obey orders, it is okay to delay for a few days." The 28th has long passed, and the new decision is to extend the period by ten days from the 28th. The Third Route Army will withdraw to the west of the Wei River before November 8th in accordance with the order of the Military and Political Department. (2) It has been determined that the Central Government also recognized that Yantai and Longkou will be garrisoned by the Navy. (3) Liu Zhennian's troops will hand over political power in the five counties of Yexian, Laiyang, Fushan, Muping, and Qixia in accordance with the order of the Military and Political Department. The counties of Wendeng, Haiyang, Huangxian, Zhaoyuan, Rongcheng, Pingdu, and Penglai, other than these five counties, were originally not allowed to station troops. Now, because the bandits are rampant, the Third Route Army is allowed to leave a small number of troops to maintain public order together with the local militia and public security bureau police in eastern Shandong. (4) The Central Government will send Xiong Bin, Gao Lingbai, and I to supervise the withdrawal and transfer of troops on both sides. It is reported that Gao is already in Jinan, and Xiong has not yet arrived. I intend to send Xiong Bin to Yexian and Gao Lingbai to Yantai to supervise separately. I will temporarily stay in Jinan. This is my personal opinion, and I still need to ask the Central Government for approval to handle it. (5) After the Third Route Army completes the withdrawal before November 8th, the Central Government will order Liu Zhennian to leave Shandong after the 8th. However, the location to which he will be transferred has not yet been determined. The above items can be said to have been generally resolved. As long as both parties obey the order to implement it, the Jiaodong Incident dispute has been going on for more than 40 days. Last time, I did not leave Jinan to return to Beijing, Chairman Han might not resign. If Chairman Han did not resign, there might not be today's resolution. It can be seen that the evolution of the situation has a certain steps, and it must be done step by step to achieve satisfactory results. I visited Han again today to inquire about the order of withdrawal. Han said that the issue of withdrawal is currently awaiting a formal order from the Military Department. It has been determined that the seaports of Yantai and Longkou will be handed over to the Qingdao Navy to garrison. The provincial army stationed in Yantai will be withdrawn first, but it must be handed over after the navy arrives and someone is responsible for public order, so as to avoid a vacancy in the defense and an unexpected accident. It is estimated that Liu Zhennian's troops will board a ship from Yantai to leave Shandong. After the withdrawal, all the troops will be stationed in Pingdu Changyi west of the Wei River, and the militia in eastern Shandong will be stationed in Wendeng and Rongcheng. The withdrawal can be completed before November 8th. The job assignments of the central supervisors have also been decided. Chief of General Staff Jiang (Bocheng) will supervise the withdrawal of the Third Route Army, Xiong Bin will go to Yexian to supervise Liu Zhennian's transfer, and Gao Lingbai will go to Yantai to supervise the naval occupation, the withdrawal of the provincial army, and the departure of Liu Zhennian. In addition to supervising the withdrawal and transfer of troops, the three will also be responsible for supervising the safety of the administrative personnel of the areas they are withdrawing from and ensuring that the local people are not disturbed. Their mission will not be completed until the provincial army has completed the withdrawal and Liu's troops have left. I (Han called himself) have decided to go to Hankou in person after the Jiaodong Incident is over to pay homage to the Commander-in-Chief and ask for punishment, because my actions this time were to relieve the people's suffering, and I really had no choice. Now that the matter has been resolved, I am afraid that a gap will arise if I do not go to the Central Government, so I have decided to go in person to ask for punishment. As for the rumor in the newspapers that a certain part will fill the defense after Liu Zhennian's troops leave, I have not heard of it, but I welcome any part. Tonight, all members of the provincial government set up a banquet in the Civil Affairs Department to welcome Zhang Fang and Jiang Bocheng. It is reported that Zhang Fang will go to Qingdao tomorrow. After the matter is over, he will return to Jinan and then return to Wuhan to report. (29th)</p>
<h3>Provincial Committee of Fujian Resigns En Masse</h3>
<p>▲ The Reason is Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the 19th Route Army came to Fujian, there has been news of the reorganization of the Fujian Provincial Government. As the brigade commanders of the provincial defense army, Chen Guohui and He Xianzhu, were arrested one after another, the call for reorganization became louder and louder. However, the members of the provincial government initially maintained a silent attitude, so the saying that the provincial government would be reorganized has not been realized. Recently, they suddenly expressed their negativity and held the 110th committee meeting on October 25th. Deputy Chairman Fang Shengtao proposed that the province's finances have become increasingly difficult and it is becoming increasingly difficult to handle affairs. It is really impossible to cope. They plan to resign from their respective positions in the Central Government and ask for another selection of virtuous people to maintain the overall situation. After discussion, all members of the committee jointly telegraphed Beijing to resign en masse, and ordered the secretariat of the provincial government and the four departments of civil affairs, finance, education, and construction to handle the closing and prepare for the handover. Shi Jialin, the acting director of the finance department, also declared on the spot that he could only be responsible for two more weeks. Since this news came out, the society has spread the reorganization of the provincial government again, which can be implemented within two weeks, and it is said that Jiang Guangnai has been internally appointed as chairman, Sun Xiwen as director of the civil affairs department, Fan Qiwu as director of the finance department, Huang Wan as director of the education department, Zhou Xingnan as director of the construction department, and He Gonggan as secretary-general. (It is said that He Gonggan is the director of the civil affairs department and Sun Xiwen is the secretary-general.) Other staff will also be greatly changed. However, since Fang Shengtao and others resigned en masse due to financial difficulties, the financial situation in Fujian Province is also very noteworthy. According to the recent direct income and expenditure figures of the provincial treasury recently released by the finance department, the details are as follows: (A) Part of the income: (1) Dingliang, deed tax, slaughter tax, tooth tax, business tax, etc. in Fuzhou and Funing, about 160,000 yuan. (3) About 100,000 yuan was allocated to the Xiangxiang of various troops in Yanping, Jianning, Shaowu, and Zhangzhou. (3) About 25,000 yuan was allocated to Yu Kuan in Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen. (4) The surplus Yu Kuan released by each county and tax bureau to the province is about 15,000 yuan, and the central</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 31st), the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange's spot market was still sluggish, but the futures market was more active than the previous weekend. Market prices fluctuated significantly, and trading was very active from all sides. According to statistics, the total daily turnover, although still far from the peak period of the past, set a new record since the Shanghai exchange resumed business after the market closure. Moreover, forward transactions were still minimal, with the vast majority of bond transactions for November delivery. As for the price trend of various bonds, buying interest consistently dominated the first two trading sessions of the morning, and the market was quite good. Investment inflows from all sides remained very enthusiastic, and prices rebounded by about one yuan compared to the weekend. Bonds related to troop reduction even rose by more than one and a half yuan. However, in the afternoon session, the market situation was slightly different from the morning. Although the buying enthusiasm did not weaken, as various prices had already risen significantly, it triggered profit-taking, and bulls also began to unwind their positions, which became smoother. As a result, various prices fluctuated and fell back. Ultimately, spot prices for "Consolidated 6%" and "20% Consolidated" bonds rose by over two yuan. "Troop Reduction Consolidated 6%" futures, salt tax, and financial spot prices each rose by more than one yuan, and other bonds also performed well, rising by several jiao. The total value of spot transactions for the whole day was only 19,600 yuan. The futures transactions were approximately 3.7 million yuan in the morning and 4.1 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling 7.8 million yuan.</p>

<h3>The Question of Peace in Xikang</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of Shi Qingyang’s Views</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Shi Qingyang, although the Xikang peace conference is in preparation, peace is impossible if Tibet still intends to attack. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has telegraphed the Dalai Lama to cease all military actions. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has also sent a telegram to advise him. A reply from the Dalai Lama has not yet been received. Once the reply arrives, a conference will be convened to carefully plan for peace. The participants and the content of the conference have not yet been determined. It is best that this conference brings together representatives from the Central Government, the Panchen Lama, and the Dalai Lama to find a thorough solution to the Xikang issue, which would greatly benefit the Tibetan people and the Dalai Lama. In recent years, the Tibetan people, monks, and Buddhism have become increasingly weak. The spirit of love and compassion in Buddhism is also gradually disappearing. The Dalai Lama's alcohol tax is heavy, repeatedly causing resentment among the Tibetans. Furthermore, the Dalai Lama is old. It remains doubtful whether the future successor will still be selected through the old method of drawing lots from a vase. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Site of the Steel Factory</h3>
<p>German Representative Favors Xiejia Dian</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the site of the state-owned steel factory, according to Huang Jintao, Xiejia Dian, about twenty-four miles downstream from Pukou, and Ma'anshan in Anhui Province are being considered. The Ministry initially favored Pukou due to convenient transportation, but later leaned toward Ma'anshan. Subsequently, the Military Affairs Commission sent personnel to survey the sites. They believed that Pukou's convenient transportation was related to national defense, which was not as good as Ma'anshan. However, Minister Chen and German representatives revisited both sites. After comparing the two, the German representatives favored Xiejia Dian in Pukou. Currently, relevant agencies have been ordered to send personnel to jointly study the matter. The issue of signing the loan contract requires the joint signatures of the Ministers of Finance and Industry, as well as the General Manager of the Central Bank. The Ministry has sent a letter to Finance Minister Song, proposing a date for signing. Once Song returns to Nanjing, the date will be determined, and the contract can be signed. Construction will begin immediately after the contract is signed, with the aim of completing the entire construction within three years. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Denies Public Opium Sales</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Anti-Smoking Association consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government regarding a letter from the Suzhou Anti-Drug Association and the Yangzhong County District Executive Committee stating that a large batch of opium was transported to Zhenjiang and that a certain Feng was designated as the director, and that a certain Sun would be the director in Wu County. At a time when the ban on smoking is strictly enforced, such news is shocking. If this is true, it is extremely indignant, not only bringing shame to the world, but also placing the Premier's teachings and the credibility of the National Government in what position? Therefore, a telegram was sent requesting a thorough investigation and strict punishment. After discussion by the 115th Committee of this association, it was decided to request the Jiangsu Provincial Government to investigate and reply. Accordingly, the case was recorded and forwarded. The Jiangsu Provincial Government replied, "In response to the inquiry No. 504, regarding the letter from the Suzhou Anti-Drug Branch requesting an investigation and reply, etc., the rumor of public opium sales has circulated in society from time to time. However, this government has not received any special permit from the Central Government for public sales, nor has it formulated any regulations on this matter or established any related institutions. Therefore, it is a misunderstanding of rumors. Correspondingly, this is replied for your reference." This is addressed to the Anti-Smoking Committee. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Wu Chaoshu Returns to Beiping from Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wu Chaoshu returned to Beiping this morning and spoke about his trip from Beiping to Suiyuan and Baotou. He said that the natural resources were abundant, and the coal deposits were extremely rich. Coal could be obtained simply by digging with one's hands. Locally produced coal was worth three or four yuan per ton, while coal in Guangdong was priced at twenty or thirty yuan per ton and mostly purchased from Japan, which was regrettable. To develop the Northwest, one must have a good government to maintain local security, and two, improve transportation and eliminate exorbitant taxes. China's urban population is excessive. Chinese people do not need internal wars and political disputes. They can manage the Northwest. When passing through Zhangjiakou, Feng Yuxiang sent his secretary-general, Wang Yi, to invite him for a meeting. Feng did not express any specific views on foreign affairs. This was a meeting of private friendship. He will travel to Dingxian in a few days. After that, he will only travel. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Initiates Religious League</h3>
<p>Aiming to Assist Aggression Policy</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese military believes that there are many Red Swastika Society members in the three northeastern provinces, so there is an opportunity to take advantage of religion. Furthermore, the doctrines of the Swastika Society are very close to those of the Japanese Omoto sect. Therefore, they ordered Omoto sect follower Tanaka Kiyoshi to go to Beiping to contact key members of the Red Swastika Society. After arriving in Beiping, Tanaka sought meetings with Duan Qirui and Lu Zhangyu, and personally met with the Panchen Lama. He said that the Lama religion and the Swastika Society have similar ideas, and that China, Japan, and Manchuria can be linked through religion to seek the permanent happiness of the three countries. If Chinese religious leaders agree, Japan hopes to organize a religious alliance of Chinese and Japanese nationals to save the crisis between China and Japan. It is said that the Panchen Lama and Duan Qirui only took a perfunctory attitude and did not give a clear answer. The Japanese aggression policy can be said to be all-encompassing.

On the 31st, they attended the weekly memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen and gave instructions on methods to save the country, stating that China is currently in a critical situation of survival, which stems from the failure of education and the decline of national character. The practical work of saving the country now requires developing the economy and focusing on education, which is the ancient saying of "ten years of accumulation, ten years of education." To save China and restore national character, only educators can actively train young students in the true meaning of China's inherent morality, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, so that China can be revived and the nation can be glorified. After the meeting, they accompanied He Jian and party and government leaders to Yuelu Mountain to participate in the public memorial ceremony for the four martyrs, Huang Xing, Cai E, Jiao Dafeng, and Chen Zuoxin.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Weakness</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is very weak, and the downward trend is intensifying. Due to the poor environment and the consecutive declines in American cotton for two days, people are nervous and mostly inclined to sell. Although the Rongxing bulls are struggling to maintain support, the actual demand is extremely sluggish. All ports are lifeless, so the situation is weak and unstable. However, some people, due to their established positions, are not actively short-selling.</p>
<p>▲People's Standard Down 1.4 Taels. The opening of the previous market was due to the decline in American cotton, which was unfavorable. Many people closed their positions, and each month fell by 1.45 taels. The market was more depressed in the afternoon. However, the closing price rebounded, resulting in a mid-month increase of 0.02 taels. The total transaction volume for the day was 28,200 bales. The sales of Changfeng were 1,000 bales, Xincheng 1,100 bales, Tongxing 850 bales, Jifeng 700 bales, and Yukang 600 bales. The purchases of Dafu were 1,500 bales, Changji 650 bales, Yichang 1,700 bales, Renfeng 500 bales, and Yicheng 500 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Price Increase/Decrease Remaining Balances</p>
<p>October 1434 (-1.340), 450</p>
<p>November 1435 (-1.454), 400</p>
<p>December 1442 (-1.39), 400 Total 318,300</p>
<p>January 1449 (-1.412), 450</p>
<p>▲Current Yarn Consumption Extremely Stagnant. The clearance of current yarn is quite sluggish. The total purchase volume by various trading groups for the whole day was only 411 bales. The market price fell by 0.05 to 0.1 taels. The purchase amount of each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Ningbo 75 Guangdong 85 Local Trade 61 Luzhou 40</p>
<p>Jiangxi 42 Inland 83 Wuhu 5 Zhenjiang 20</p>
<h3>Local Cotton Plunges with American Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very weak, and the downward trend has started again because American cotton is weak, falling for two consecutive days, and a certain manufacturer continues to sell in large quantities. It is said that they are negotiating a delayed payment of 300,000 bales of American cotton, and they were fear that this becomes a reality, so they are selling as much Chinese cotton as possible. However, in general, the small individual's psychology is that the price of Chinese cotton has already fallen about 5 taels when the price was higher. Moreover, the market prices of the local trading house are difficult to lower, and they rise to buy more, but there will eventually be a major change in the American cotton around the presidential election on November 8.</p>
<p>▲Zheng Standard Falls by As Much as 0.055 Taels. The opening of the Zheng Standard in the previous market was not good due to the decline in American cotton, and each month fell by 0.05 taels. The market situation was still weak in the afternoon and fell by another 0.005 taels. The total transaction volume for the day was 86,000 dan. The sales of Jifeng were 5,400 dan, Suijiang 2,700 dan, Dachang 3,200 dan, Xincheng 5,700 dan, Yuanda 4,000 dan, Hengde 2,100 dan, and Changfeng 1,500 dan. The purchases of Mingde were 2,800 dan, Shenchang 2,300 dan, Changyu 2,400 dan, and Changfeng 2,800 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Closing Price Increase/Decrease Remaining Balances</p>

<p>December 3085 (-0.055), 226600 Total 944,600</p>
<p>January 3095 (-0.055), 5547500</p>
<p>▲The need for raw cotton from the factories is not much. The current need is very weak. The source is estimated to be 1224 bales of Yao flower, 650 bales of Tong flower, and 27.25 three-wheeled piers. Chongxin entered 300 pieces for factory delivery.</p>
<p>American cotton 33.10 Xinfeng entered 160 pieces and delivered to the warehouse.</p>
<h3>Indian Print Cotton Industry Weekly News</h3>
<p>▲Bombay last week, the exchange rate between India and the United States fell, so head traders made profits to offset the unstable weather in the cotton-producing areas, but the harvest was generally satisfactory, the export trade was extremely light, the difference between India and the United States was very small, and the European trade was silent.</p>
<p>▲Liverpool last week, the spot transaction has made great progress, futures trading has decreased due to weak silver prices, speculative transactions have decreased, Bombay helped with huge purchases, spot demand has also made progress, and because the weather in the US cotton area is good, it has been hindered. Egyptian cotton followed the up and down with American cotton, but the cotton farmers judged that the market price still needs to be weaker, and they are releasing it day by day.</p>
<h3>Food Pu River Rice Plunges by 0.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>▲Yesterday, there were quite a lot of boats arriving at the Pu River in Shanghai, about 60-70 boats. Transactions in this street were extremely sluggish. Two kinds of white rice, Baigeng and Bai Ge Rice, plunged by 0.5 yuan. Kiln-grown white rice and field rice also followed the trend, down by 3-4 feet. Lu Yang Jian was tired because of the sufficient supply of japonica rice, taking 0.23 yuan off. It becomes negative by 2 yuan, it is clear and hidden.</p>
<p>▲Yesterday morning, there were very few people in the market in Xinzha. North japonica fresh station was determined. The price of goods in the old secondary center was lower by 0.4 yuan. The shipment of kiln-grown Baige and other goods was increasingly rare, and the price fell by 0.23 yuan or so. The amount of Baidao that arrived in Yexie, Zhangyan, and Songxian was limited, and the price was tired. There were more than 40 boats arriving from the inland, and each cargo amounted to nearly a thousand stones.</p>
<h3>The First Shipment of Jiangxi Aircraft Late Rice Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>—Yang Rice Continues to be Handled by Min Gang—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the offtake of the Yang rice in the area between the main street and the north stagnated. However, the Fuzhou area operators had a very good appetite and purchased 1,000 bags of small twisted rice at the market price of 7.95 yuan and 8 yuan, which was as high as 8.05 yuan, which was 0.1 yuan higher than the previous week. The interest in purchases of this sector continued to run high, so the market conditions are also quite firm.</p>
<p>The arrival and storage of Xiang rice are scarce, and the operators from Fujian also have an interest, but there is no way to purchase it because the goods are scarce. However, yesterday, 51 bags of new Jiangxi aircraft late rice arrived, which was the first shipment to Shanghai this year. The price was 9.4 yuan, and it was also handled by operators from Ganzhou. The rice is still transferable, and this is a test run. It is expected that there will be continued shipments.</p>
<h3>Delivery of Powder and Wheat in October</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery of period flour in October. The delivery situation was quite deserted all day long. It seems that the inventory of each factory should be abundant in the standard market, but the delivery is so sparse, which is inevitable in contrast to the fact. I don’t know that each factory's spot is usually 0.235 yuan higher than the standard call price, so the standard and the spot are separated. Until the end of the month, it is either taken back by themselves or taken away by Hakka people. For example, in October, the official delivery of Flour only accounted for 1,000 bags from Huafengyuan Maigen. There were no other deliveries. As for the standard situation, foreign wheat fell by another 0.34 yuan, and the excess of domestic catering was also exposed. It is feared that a new record will be re-established when the market opens.</p>
<p>The delivery of wheat in October was about 50 trucks, but only three trucks were officially delivered at the exchange, which were delivered on the 27th, and the receivers were truck No. 8, 2 and truck No. 42, 1.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Dim Prospects for Silk Sales in Europe and America</h3>
<p>—Most of the Remaining Silk Cocoons are in the Hands of the Financial Sector—</p>
<p>—Foreign Prices are So Low that Selling at a Loss is Difficult—</p>
<p>Due to the increasingly deteriorating political and economic situation in European and American markets, the sales of raw silk factories have not improved. Japanese silk is being dumped aggressively, leaving no stone unturned in its encroachment. This has caused the Chinese silk market to plummet. The prices offered by overseas white silk mills are surprisingly low. Currently, most of the raw silk and dry cocoons held by Chinese merchants are in the hands of the financial sector. The losses are huge, making it difficult to sell at a loss. The market atmosphere is quiet. Yesterday, only 20 bales of top-grade Sichuan yellow silk from Kaili were traded at the price of 425 taels.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decrease in Guangdong Silk Exports</h3>
<p>—Less Than 1,000 Bales Shipped to the United States in October—</p>
<p>Guangdong new-style white filature silk originally held a considerable position in the European and American markets. The annual export volume from Hong Kong totaled approximately 40,000 to 50,000 bales. During peak sales seasons, monthly exports reached 6,000 to 7,000 bales. Even in off-seasons, exports were at least 2,000 to 3,000 bales. In recent years, due to the impact of low-priced Japanese silk dumping, Guangdong silk sales have plummeted. This summer, sales to the United States briefly improved but were fleeting.</p>
<p>Before long, they weakened again. Recently, due to the election turmoil in the United States, silk sales have been lifeless. Guangdong silk exports have decreased significantly. Statistics of Guangdong silk exports from Hong Kong in October show that less than 1,000 bales (80 catties per bale) were shipped to New York, Seattle, San Francisco, and other ports in the United States, totaling only 937 bales.</p>
<h3>European Sales of “Chou Hsin Chen Mei” Green Tea Actively Pursued</h3>
<p>European Sales of “Chou Hsin Chen Mei” Green Tea Actively Pursued</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign-firm tea market, various firms such as Ying Zhuang Xie He, Jin Long, Du De, and Hua Tea Company, were actively pursuing the sale of Chou Hsin Chen Mei green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi. Transactions were not dull, but prices still could not rise. Although the Russian Xie Zhu Hui foreign firm had planned to actively trade Tunxi Zhen Mei previously, they had to temporarily wait and see, as the current tea prices did not meet the prices set by overseas telegrams. Regarding Gong Xi Zhen Mei and other varieties, there were some sporadic transactions, with prices falling by two to three taels compared to previous sales.</p>
<h3>Lining Materials Show Genuine Increases and Artificial Decreases</h3>
<p>Currently, wool fabrics and woolen goods are in high demand due to the season. Transactions for both heavy and light fabrics are brisk. Wholesalers are rushing to fulfill orders from foreign firms. Sales of lining materials are even more active, with genuine goods suddenly becoming popular. Wholesale prices have increased by five to six fen per yard compared to the previous few days. As the weather turns cold, Chinese and Western overcoats are hitting the market, leading to a surge in sales of lining materials. However, the supply is limited, causing a shortage of available stock. Therefore, the industry anticipates further price increases. Genuine lining materials that were previously sold for one tael and one qian have now uniformly risen to one tael and two qian at the trade association. On the other hand, the market for fake lining materials is declining, with prices being reduced. This is because there is an abundance of stock, leading to a trend opposite to that of genuine goods. Yesterday, fake lining materials from Tai He, Gong Ping, De Ji, Tian Xiang, and other brands were uniformly reduced to three qian and eight fen five li at the trade association. Brokers could still earn some commission on resales.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Market: Some Shipments of Dutch Red Sugar Were Released Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained firm. The association showed no intention of releasing grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar. Ordinary grades were offered at 15 taels without a transaction. A lot of 200 bags of high-grade was traded at 15 taels and 5 fen. Grades 18 and 20 medium granulated white sugar remained firm without any changes. Grade 8 new Dutch red sugar was priced at 11 taels and 7 or 8 qian, while old stock was at 11 taels and 2 qian. Grade 19 old stock of Dutch red sugar was also stable at 11 taels and 6 yuan and 7 qian. Besides Chang Xing, Hua Xin also had a batch of sugar priced at 40 yuan, totaling 9,000 bags, which was rumored to be sold. The Chao gang have not been settled for Huizhou white.</p>
<h3>Scarcity of Tong’an Dried Longan from South and North</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the weakening of the quotation of Tong’an dried longan, both cargo owners and merchants suffered losses, leading to a significant decrease in supply. It is reported that only a little over a hundred boxes were imported from Jinan yesterday. Therefore, sellers are temporarily holding their inventory. However, due to sluggish market sales, merchants are not daring to increase their inventory. With both sides holding firm, the market situation is weak.</p>
<h3>Coal: National Coal Transactions Are Still Good</h3>
<p>National coal transactions have been relatively good recently. Yesterday, a local shipping company purchased a large quantity of Bo Shan coal, priced at 10 taels and 2 qian and 5 fen for Shan coal and 9 taels and 5 qian for Xiao Shan coal. Yue Sheng coal also bought a significant amount, priced at 9 taels and 5 qian. The sales of Da Tong coal lumps have not been good, but the transaction volume of Tong coal is still considerable. Yesterday, over 200 tons were traded at 12 taels and 5 qian.</p>

<h3>Dumping of Japanese Goods in the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>▲ Selling at Reduced Prices to Liquidate Stock and Seek Profit</p>
<p>▲ Warships Escorting Bridges, Carrying [Goods] to the Upper Reaches to Resume Business</p>
<p>▲ Arrival of Overwhelming Japanese Goods, Japanese goods are entering in a very crowded manner recently, with an average of 50,000 pieces imported per week. Many unscrupulous merchants are extracting them at night. The Japanese are switching to selling for cash, with prices being discounted by 30-40% to achieve their goal of dumping in China. Yesterday, the Ikoma Maru arrived in Shanghai, bringing over another 8,400 pieces of Japanese goods. Textiles, hardware, leather, medicine, food, and seafood were all stocked, especially many clocks. This caused the regular ships to be unable to carry all the cargo, so the Nagasaki Maru and Shanghai Maru, which are fast lines that typically do not carry cargo, each carried 1,000+ pieces one time to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Flourishing Sales in the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River is the most important sales area for Japanese goods. The Japanese consulates in various ports along the river have successfully established mobile police forces. Japanese goods can now be openly loaded and unloaded at various ports along the Yangtze River. Recently, the Japanese shipping company Nissin's Yangtze River ships have been exporting, with transshipments of Japanese goods from Shanghai to various ports in Hankou reaching 400-500 tons each time.</p>
<p>Before the January 28th Incident, many Japanese residents in various ports in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Sichuan left and returned to their home countries, collectively stopping trade. The Japanese consul in Chongqing also left, and all Japanese residents withdrew from Sichuan. In the past two months, Japanese residents in the upper reaches, such as Shashi and Yichang, have gradually returned to resume business. Only Chongqing has not yet returned to its pre-war state. Now that the policy of dumping Japanese goods is being implemented, the Japanese government is subsidizing Japanese residents who withdrew from Sichuan, ordering them to return to resume business. The Shanghai First Overseas Dispatch Team of the Japanese Navy is specifically transporting them to Sichuan for the resumption of business. It has already sent the Japanese residents to Hankou, and yesterday, the warship Atami was specially dispatched to transport all the residents to Chongqing to resume business. This is the first batch of Japanese warships and Japanese residents entering Sichuan since the war. ▲ Exports of Coarse Grains, Chinese coarse grains being shipped to Japan, after being halted after the war, are now flourishing. It was discovered that in October, the Japanese purchased 20,000 bags of rapeseed from various locations along the Yangtze River, which is over 12,000 more bags compared to the 8,000 bags shipped in the same month last year. In addition, 150,000 bags of wheat bran were shipped to Japan in October, compared to 70,000 bags in the same month last year, an increase of 80,000 bags. In addition, large quantities of rapeseed cake and cottonseed cake were also shipped. The continuous purchase and transportation are still ongoing.</p>
<h3>Meilor’s Statement on the Issue of Reforming Customs Administration</h3>
<p>Regarding the Jianghai Customs' search of shops for goods evading taxes, the "Continental News" stated that this action was not very legal. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the National News Agency specifically interviewed Inspector General Meilor about this matter. According to Meilor, in recent years, some merchants in Shanghai have adopted various methods to smuggle goods into the country, and such malpractices have been seen frequently. Although the Customs has implemented various anti-smuggling measures to prevent this, smugglers' tricks are constantly evolving, making it virtually impossible to prevent. Under these circumstances, in order to protect national tax revenue, the Customs has no choice but to search private smuggling shops. The method of searching shops is also adopted by various countries in the East and West, and the Jianghai Customs is not the first to adopt this example. Moreover, the Jianghai Customs conducts searches of shops completely in accordance with the law. Before the search, it must apply to the Shanghai Special District Court for a search warrant. When the search is carried out, it will also cooperate with the police of the Public Concession to assist. Therefore, there is nothing inappropriate in the procedures, and there is no need to argue deeply. The report stated that the shops searched by the Customs were limited to Chinese merchants and that no foreign merchants were searched by the Customs, which is inconsistent with the facts. In fact, some foreign merchants were among those searched by the Customs previously. The report also stated that the goods seized by the Customs were all purchased from foreign merchants and had no tax bills, etc., which is also inconsistent with the facts. The Customs has obtained accurate documents sufficient to fully prove that most of the seized goods were directly imported from overseas, and there are often unscrupulous merchants colluding with foreign merchants to smuggle goods into China or forge bills of lading in order to deceive and obscure the situation. Furthermore, the Customs always carefully considers before each search of a shop and then executes it. If there is no conclusive evidence, it will never act rashly, and it will especially not disturb legitimate merchants without reason. Therefore, each time a search is carried out, a large number of smuggled goods are found.</p>
<h3>Discovery of a Major Conspiracy in a Common Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>▲ 23 Criminals Apprehended</p>
<p>▲ Important Case Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>▲ Police Escorted with Caution</p>
<p>Recently, the Laozha Police Station uncovered a major conspiracy while investigating a common kidnapping case. The details are not yet fully clear. All that is known is that the arrested criminals are suspected not only of kidnapping and murder but also of being heavily involved in the bombing cases at the French Concession residences of Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei, who is on leave for treatment, and the current Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen. There is an important conspiracy case still under investigation at this time. The suspects were apprehended on the 26th of last month by Laozha Police Station's Chinese Chief Detective You A'ge, Detective Liu Junqing, and Detective Li Shugui, together with Western detectives requested from the French Police Station, at two locations: 90 Min Ti Ni Yin Road and 283 Da An Li, Kai Zi Er Road, in the French Concession. A total of 23 people were arrested, all from Sichuan. Their names are as follows: (1) Long Lin (also known as Junwu Shaoyuan), (2) Ma Yijin (also known as Desheng), (3) Tang Ming (also known as Xiazi), (4) Ma Yinhe, (5)</p>
<p>Tian Zemin, (6) Weng Xinwu, (7) Chen Chunting, (8) Li Yuncheng, (9) Zhang Chun, (10) Chen Jiesan, (11) He Yinshan, (12) Wan Jiayun, (13) Liu Hanqing, (14) Qin Tianyou, (15) Xiang Ziyun, (16) Xu Hongyuan, (17) Wang Yunqiao, (18) Su Yi'an, (19) Wang Bolin, (20) Yu Minghai, (21) Li Zhongfa, (22) Feng Guoqi, (23) Xiong Shaocheng. One hand grenade, one pistol, and nineteen bullets were seized. Initially, it was only known that they had kidnapped Lu Ziqing, a compradore of Huada Trading Company, on Kunming Road at 9:00 AM on September 24th and then murdered him. However, under arrest and investigation, such a shocking major case was discovered. The police authorities have attached great importance to this case. Yesterday was the scheduled date for the trial, but the police station has not yet concluded its investigation. Even if the trial were opened, it would have to be postponed. There were concerns about the safety of transporting such a large number of important criminal suspects back and forth. Therefore, the police station's lawyer, Ru Bao'er, made a statement in court when the case was being heard by Qian Hongye, the criminal court of the First Special District District Court, yesterday morning. He stated that the investigation has not yet been concluded and requested a further postponement of the trial. He also stated that the police station, in order to prevent</p>
<p>any danger along the way, did not escort the defendants to court because the defendants' confessions would not be interrogated today. Meanwhile, Wen Hongen, the director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, believed that the criminals</p>
<p>were the perpetrators of the bombing of the residences of the two Premiers, Wang and Song, and should be handed over to the mainland authorities for severe punishment. Therefore, he prepared an official document and specially dispatched the bureau's investigation team leaders Gao Wansheng, Wang Shengsheng, and Gu Liancheng, along with twelve detectives, to the court to apply for the transfer. Judge Qian ruled that the case was still under investigation and should be investigated and handled upon verification. He then approved the police station lawyer's request and instructed that the hearing be postponed.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees Decides to Purchase Relief Clothing Outside the Customs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Association of Charitable Organizations for Northeastern Refugees held its seventh regular meeting at Renji Shantang yesterday afternoon. Those present were Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Wang Peiyuan, Liu Yunfang, Qian Jingping, Zhang Xiaolin (representing Zhu Buqing), Cui Xianlou, Du Yuesheng (representing Li Zizai), Li Zizai, Huang Hanzhi, Zheng Hongnian (representing Huang Bodu), Huang Bodu, Chen Qicai Fan Guang, Zhao Jinqing, Zhu Yinjiang, etc. Vice Chairman Wang Yiting presided. First, the chairman reported on the total amount of relief funds received. Liu Yunfang reported on the amount of charitable horseracing lottery income. Wang Peiyuan reported that after arriving in Ping, he and Qu Wenliu and others were determined not to be surrounded, and focused on investigating the disaster situation in the Northeast and contacting the method of relief. It was learned that the weather outside the border had reached severe cold, and the relief of winter clothes could not be delayed. If it is delayed any longer, the victims will freeze to death. Peiyuan had to go to Manila to participate in the dedication ceremony of the American Red Cross Manila branch, so he first returned to Shanghai to go abroad. Now Qu Jun decided to preside over in Ping, and Feng Yangshan Jun has planned to go out of the customs to personally preside over the relief affairs. As for winter relief clothes, it is cheaper and saves time and taxes to manufacture them in Changchun and Harbin. Cui Xianlou reported on the disaster situation he witnessed when he returned to Ping from Harbin to Shanghai, and reported that the manufacturing price of a winter clothing set in Harbin was about "Harbin Ocean" 4 yuan, equivalent to about 3 yuan and 2 jiao Shanghai currency. The following resolutions were passed: (1) The Northeast relief clothing case was publicly decided to inform Qu and Feng by telegram to allow them to arrange the purchase outside the customs. (3) Director Jingren Lai's letter, asking to resign as chairman due to his father's death, was publicly decided to reply by telegram to retain him. (3) If the relief funds are insufficient, how should we raise funds? The public resolution was: (A) Invite Mr. Zheng Shaojue to the meeting to discuss fundraising methods separately; (B) Distribute donation boxes and ask newspapers, hotels, and temples to set up one in front of the door to await donations from everyone. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. A letter entrusted by Qu Yingguang and Feng Xuefen to Mr. Wang Peiyuan is also recorded below: "All colleagues, Jian: Respectfully, Qi Zhe, the two telegrams previously sent by Ma Yang were examined. Recently, I received the sad news of Qiu Pu Jing Lao's death, which is extremely sad. I have already replied to express condolences and will register for the Shi Lun Dharma Assembly to commemorate him. It is also a rare opportunity to meet Shengdian, which can help Shengxi's strength. However, I念 that the Shanghai Association is at a critical juncture, and Chairman Xu cannot come to Shanghai for a while. It will inevitably be more difficult for colleagues to lose this master. I hope that the wise men in charge will spare time to assist in maintaining the good deeds and work hard and rest well. Today, Bongyou Cui Xianlou Jun will report on the current situation in the disaster area after investigating from Harbin, and bring back many photos, which are miserable to read and heartbreaking to hear. Today, Peiyuan will take it back first, and Mr. Peiyuan will present a brief overview of the methods to be carried out here. Cotton clothes can be made in Harbin, and the size of each set is about 3 yuan and 1 or 2 jiao Shanghai currency, which is more expensive than Shanghai, but it can save freight and various twists and turns, so it is better to take materials locally for convenience. I won't repeat them, and I will explain them in detail later."</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan and Others Telegraph Hu Wenhus Request for Continuous Aid</h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Wenhu, owner of Tiger Balm Yong An Tang, has always been enthusiastic about disaster relief and national salvation. The disaster-stricken area in the Northeast this time is very extensive. Mr. Hu has repeatedly donated large sums of money and Tiger Balm medicine, which General Zhu Qinglan and others distributed on his behalf, saving many Northeast compatriots in distress. It is now heard that Mr. Hu of the same company has received a telegram from General Zhu and others, still hoping for continuous assistance. The telegram reads as follows: "Respectfully received your telegram, we are fully aware of everything. Your Excellency has already provided relief medicines and donated large sums of money, showing your tireless benevolence and patriotic sincerity, which we deeply admire. We immediately replied with a telegram, expressing our gratitude on behalf of the suffering compatriots in the Northeast. We hereby inform you that we have received 5,000 yuan from the Guohua Bank and handed it over to the council of our association for proper deliberation and distribution according to the needs of various departments at the front. Our association feels the urgent need for assistance for the volunteer army. Without a central organization to help, it will be difficult to sustain. Therefore, we have to make every effort to organize and fulfill our responsibilities. Fortunately, since its establishment, it has received enthusiastic assistance from our patriotic people, and the association's affairs are progressing smoothly. (Omission) We have always admired Your Excellency as a leader of overseas Chinese merchants, with a long-standing reputation at home and abroad. We hope that you will arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese at any time to assist the Northeast and relieve the national crisis. We are fortunate to hear that Your Excellency has completed your public duties and will come to Shanghai in the future. Please be sure to grace our association with your presence for guidance and jointly discuss the great plan of national salvation. We are immensely looking forward to it. We respectfully wish you efforts for the country." - Zhu Qinglan, Cai Tingkai, Wen Zongyao.</p>
<h3>West District Fire Brigade Chief and Son Save Household Expenses to Aid the Northeast</h3>
<p>Since the Northeast Refugee Relief Association launched the monthly donation campaign, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically pledged donations, with several cases occurring every day. Yesterday, Mr. Xia Guoliang, the head of the West District Fire Brigade, sent a letter to the association, stating that he and his son, Li Gang, had decided to save 10 yuan per month from their daily household expenses. He acknowledged that it was a drop in the bucket and would not solve the overall situation. However, he hoped to gather a little contribution from everyone to make up for some of the losses and wished that all circles would follow suit, so that they could have a continuous supply of assistance to achieve the goal of killing the enemy and restoring our broken homeland. Mr. Xia and his son have always been very enthusiastic about local public welfare affairs. Now they are advocating a method of saving household expenses to fulfill their ambition of donating monthly, which can also set a good example.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Measures in This City</h3>
<p>▲ Mayor Wu Reported at the City Government Memorial Week Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday (Monday) at 9:00 AM, the Municipal Government of this city held the Premier's Memorial Week. All staff attended. Mayor Wu chaired the meeting and reported on the various measures taken by the municipality. The records are as follows: "A formal meeting will be held soon. Hereafter, all colleagues in the government should pay attention to all administrative matters in the city, such as the formulation of single-line regulations, the preparation of budgets, and the creation of construction projects. Anything that falls under the authority of the Municipal Council must be submitted for discussion and approval before it can be implemented. Once the Municipal Council has made a resolution, it should be submitted to the council by the mayor in accordance with the law, so as to conform to the true meaning of establishing the Municipal Council. Do not regard the Municipal Council as a mere tool for advocating public opinion. If the administrative organs can respect the legislative organs, then the legislative organs will naturally cooperate with the administrative organs. Mutual respect and cooperation between the two parties will definitely lead to progress in the future municipal construction. As for the issue of the reconstruction of the war zone, all construction plans cannot be carried out without funds. I have instructed Director Cai of the Finance Bureau to raise funds, which has already made considerable progress. After submitting it to the National Government for approval, it will be fully allocated for the reconstruction of the Zhabei war zone. However, the reconstruction area requires a large amount of funds, which cannot be solved by several million yuan. However, at a time when the economic situation in Shanghai is declining and it is difficult to raise funds, raising these several million yuan is not an easy task. As long as the first step of the work can be carried out effectively, the entire plan will not be difficult to realize step by step. Regarding the overall social situation of the city and the changes caused by the January 28th Incident, I also hope that all colleagues will pay close attention to it, intensify their work, and jointly seek the revitalization of Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Weng Zhaoyuan Answered the Banquet of All Circles Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ All Groups Will See Him Off This Afternoon</p>
<p>Mr. Weng Zhaoyuan, former Brigade Commander of the 156th Brigade of the 19th Route Army, has been back in Shanghai from Hankou for more than a month. During his stay in Shanghai, in addition to connecting with the Aviation Construction Association, the Aviation National Salvation Association, and various groups, he was warmly welcomed by various groups in the city. Yesterday noon, because Mr. Weng himself was about to go to Europe, he specially hosted a banquet at the Bank Club to thank all circles. More than 40 representatives from various groups attended, and the hosts and guests enjoyed themselves to the fullest.</p>
<p>Weng Zhaoyuan will leave Shanghai in a few days. All groups are preparing to send representatives to the wharf to see him off. According to Mr. Yin Zhiling of the China Aviation Construction Association yesterday, General Weng firmly declined the long-distance farewell from all circles at the wharf. Moreover, the time of departure from the port has not yet been determined. Therefore, the association, together with the Local Cooperation Association, various trade associations under the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, various groups under the National Salvation Federation, and various branches under the Civic Federation, totaling more than 300 groups, initiated a meeting to be held at 3:00 PM today in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on North Henan Road to see him off. General Weng will also be invited to report on his overseas inspection plan to say goodbye. Admission tickets for various groups, schools, and agencies have already been distributed yesterday. All circles are welcome to take a seat. Those who have not received them can obtain them from the Aviation Construction Association in the Mainland Shopping Mall on Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>It is heard that Weng Zhaoyuan is scheduled to take the President Madison of the Great China Company tonight and leave Shanghai tomorrow morning to go to various ports in Southeast Asia and various countries in Europe and America to discuss aviation construction matters. Various groups in the city are scheduled to go to the Customs Wharf at 9:00 PM tonight to see him off.</p>
<h3>Two Aviation Associations Passed the Merger Principle</h3>
<p>▲ Weng Zhaoyuan Hosted Executives from Both Sides</p>
<p>▲ It Was Decided that Each Would Send Representatives to Jointly Consult</p>
<p>The China Aviation Construction Association and the China Aviation National Salvation Association believe that aviation national salvation is the most important plan at present. Since the purposes of the two associations are the same, there is a possibility of merger. Therefore, Mr. Weng Zhaoyuan specially hosted a banquet for the executives of both sides at the Bank Club at noon yesterday. Those present included Yin Zhiling, Li Cishan, Feng Shaoshan, Wu Shan, Luo Yinpu, Jiang Junyi and others, permanent directors of the Aviation Construction Association, and Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Wojiang, Yu Qiaqing and others, preparatory committee members of the Aviation National Salvation Association. During the meeting, Mr. Weng, the chairman, first reported the necessity of merging the two associations, and then the merger principle was passed. Each side will first send a number of representatives to jointly consult on the merger procedures, and then formally announce a unified name. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Villagers in Pengpu District Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Suggested Moving the Land Enclosure for the New Station to Another Site</p>
<p>The villagers in Pengpu District of this city previously requested the authorities to reduce the land enclosure for the construction of a new station by the Ministry of Railways in that area because it was too wide and increased the suffering of the people. However, they had petitioned various parties several times without any real effect. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, more than 200 residents from five villages in the district, including Wangjiajing, Zhao Jia Garden, East Zhangjiazhai, West Zhangjiazhai, and Zhu Jiazhai, went to the Municipal Government in Fenglinqiao to petition, requesting that the Ministry of Railways be consulted to understand the people's difficulties and reduce the land enclosure. The villagers elected six representatives, including Hou Xuanqing, Zhao Chubei, Zhao Youting, Hou Jingcheng, Zhao Wenxiu, and Zhang Zhongxiang, to request an audience with Mayor Wu. Wu sent Yuan Shenglu, director of the Second Section, to meet with them on his behalf. The representatives told him about the excessive land enclosure by the Ministry of Railways and the difficulties of the people. Because everyone relies on farming for a living, even if they can get some land price when the land is enclosed, there is no way to find work for a while, which poses a problem for people's livelihood. Therefore, they requested that the location be changed, and the North Station should be built on the south side of the road. The villages there are sparse, the population is small, and the impact is also small. It is also close to the Suzhou River, which can make water and land transportation integrated, and the convenience of transportation is more than this. Director Yuan replied that Mayor Wu has always been considerate of the people's difficulties and paid great attention to this matter. He will buy and offer opinions to the Ministry of Railways from the perspective of the people and for the benefit of the people. Please adopt them. Now you can go back and wait quietly for a solution. The crowd returned at 12:00 noon.</p>

<p>increase it. The Municipal Government believes that the funds are limited, and the case has been decided and cannot be changed. However, the villagers in various districts and townships are still difficult to understand. It is heard that dozens of villagers suddenly gathered in front of the Jiangwan District Municipal Committee Office, requesting the quick distribution of relief funds. Wu Xuen, a municipal commissioner of the district, replied that the relief funds had not yet been received and persuaded them to go home in peace. However, a few people rushed into the door and were about to use force. Fortunately, the nearby police station sent police to maintain order, and the villagers began to disperse. It is heard that they will continue to petition tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Hui Relief Disciples Went to Beijing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>▲ Foreigners in this city are paying close attention to this dispute</p>
<p>The dispute between the Hui religion and the Beixin Bookstore in this city has sent representatives to Beijing to petition one after another yesterday. All the Muslims went to the North Station to see them off. This matter is now attracting the attention of foreigners. ▲ The three representatives of Muslims who went to Beijing to petition, Da Pusheng, Mu Huating, and Wu Yongxia, took the Beijing-Shanghai express train to Beijing at 9:25 yesterday morning, representing all the Muslims in this city, to petition the Executive Yuan. About 200 Muslims took 14 rented cars to the North Station to see them off. As the train was about to depart, they lined up at the North Railway Station to pray for the representatives. However, there were no slogans or flag banners. They only held a farewell flag, which was unfurled when they arrived at the station, with the words "Shanghai Muslims Farewell Representatives to Beijing to Petition." In addition, one representative, Ma Xingche, only took the night train to Nanjing last night due to an affair. There were also more than a dozen people who saw him off.</p>
<p>▲ Foreigners Pay Attention The reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency has been going to various consulates for days. When interviewing news, he often encountered consuls or consulate officials who inquired about the development of the case from reporters. Judging from their intentions, they seem to attach great importance to this case. The reason for their consideration is that Muslims in China are mostly scattered in the cities of various provinces. If it cannot be resolved as soon as possible, it seems that there is a possibility of a prairie fire, which may cause unrest in various places. The worst thing is that a certain foreign news agency deliberately expanded the words and sent telegrams to various ports in the north to provoke people's hearts. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption of This Year's Property Tax in Wusong</h3>
<p>▲ Due to Severe Damage After the War</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "Regarding the request, we received a letter on the 29th of this month from the Wusong branch of our association, stating, 'Our office has received letters from merchants and residents in this district, stating that the people of Wusong suffered particularly severely in this war. After the area was recovered, merchants and residents, driven by the need to make a living, cleared away rubble, salvaged remnants, and hastily rebuilt homes for temporary business. This is hardly a recovery. Therefore, we requested an exemption from all property taxes long ago. However, the other day, Wusong suddenly received a notice from the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau regarding the collection of property taxes, which stated, "The city's collection of property taxes is calculated based on rent. Businesses and factories are charged 14%, and residential households are charged 10%, with tenants and landlords each bearing half. The tax owed by landlords should be paid by tenants on their behalf, with tax receipts offsetting rent. For self-owned properties, taxes are assessed based on estimated rent, which is to be paid by the landlords themselves. The property tax for the autumn season of the 21st year is now being collected, and funds for payment should be prepared in full. This bureau will send personnel with receipts to collect the taxes within a specific period." Reading this, we were extremely shocked. The magnitude of the losses suffered by Wusong in this war is unprecedented. The entire town was reduced to scorched earth. The merchants and residents' generations of hard work and decades of effort were lost in an instant. Whether they are tenants or landlords, all are deeply wounded. The Municipal Finance Bureau, not understanding that the area has not yet recovered and is still scarred, is imposing taxes, adding to the suffering of our people. Merchants and residents simply cannot bear it. Therefore, we appeal to your esteemed association to convey to the Shanghai Municipal Government the plight of the disaster-stricken merchants and residents of Wusong and grant them an exemption until next year's collection. This would be a public service of immeasurable merit." Upon receiving this, we investigated and found that the Wusong area suffered severe damage after the war, and the stated difficulties are indeed true. We are writing to your esteemed association to humbly request that you consider the hardships faced by businesses and convey this to the Shanghai Municipal Government, instructing the Finance Bureau to grant an exemption until next year's collection. This is our earnest prayer." We have found that the city's regulations for reducing and exempting rent are limited to a full exemption for the spring and summer seasons in the disaster area. However, the spring war was still in progress, and the armistice agreement for the summer was only signed on May 5th. Japanese soldiers had only completely withdrawn by the end of summer, so there was no property tax to collect within this period. The task of cleaning up the debris and gradually resuming business only began in the autumn. If taxes are to be collected according to regulations on top of the severe damage already suffered, it is truly beyond their ability. The request to postpone the collection until next year is a last resort, given the extent of the disaster in the affected area. We believe it is appropriate to submit a document detailing the situation to your office for review and approval, instructing the Finance Bureau to act accordingly, which would be in the public interest."</p>
<h3>The Chinese Ratepayers Association Requests Consideration of Electricity Price Increases</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday's Letter to the General Manager of the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association sent a letter to the General Manager of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Sir, we have received a letter from the Nanjing Road Business Association and a branch of the Citizens' Association stating that the Shanghai Electric Companies, based on the price increases suggested in Mr. Anson's 1929 report, have obtained approval from the municipal authorities. The Public Works Department of the International Settlement and the French Concession Board of Directors have successively granted their requests. The company, believing it has obtained a protective charm, is unilaterally forcing users to pay the new prices and threatening to cut off service. All sectors are rejecting its unreasonable demands and unanimously opposing them, organizing a united association to negotiate with it, but the company ignores them. Mr. Anson's suggestions were originally a temporary measure, not an immutable law. Moreover, Mr. Anson himself knew the impropriety of the suggestions and the fear of public opinion, so he specially issued a letter declaring that he was relieved of responsibility and unwilling to be the target of public criticism, so as to leave room for meeting the Shanghai people in the future. Therefore, the basis for the price increase is completely lost. As a municipal organ in the concession, the Department should think of the public interest in all facilities. Now, it only considers the interests of the company, and tries its best to exempt it from its obligations and guarantee its rights, allowing the company to take whatever it wants, but it ignores the great burden of the users. Although we have repeatedly appealed, it has turned a deaf ear. Moreover, on March 27, the Shanghai market was still in a state of closure, and residents of the Hongkou District had not yet moved. Even in terms of rent, there were measures for grading and exemption. Now, electricity is raising prices and retroactively pursuing them, which is especially inappropriate. We have always admired your esteemed association as the representative organ of Chinese ratepayers in the concession. When encountering matters, it should be able to argue according to reason in order to relieve the Chinese citizens from their plight. Therefore, we especially write to your esteemed association, intending to convey to the Public Works Department, to accommodate public opinion, eliminate prejudice, and negotiate with the company to cancel the compensation amount and formulate a new price list that is fairer, so as to eliminate profit disputes and stabilize business." A statement was attached to the meeting, and it is currently being reviewed. Furthermore, a letter was received from the joint office of the branches of the Citizens' Association in the Hongkou District with the same content. Accordingly, we have enclosed two copies of the declaration and sent this letter to your General Manager to submit to the Board of Directors for long-term consideration, so that the economy of the electric company and the economy of the users are mutually linked, without leaning too much on one side or the other, so as to meet the wishes of the citizens. This is our sincere prayer."</p>
<h3>Customs Brokers' Association Meeting Yesterday Requests Customs Reform of New Draft</h3>
<p>Since the Jianghai Customs revised its new regulations, it has arbitrarily imposed penalties on the customs brokerage industry for any matter, large or small, starting from two and a half mace and up to several dozen taels of silver. Therefore, the Customs Brokers' Association held a general meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Provincials Association at 3 PM yesterday. Present were 120 member representatives including Shi Zhikun, You Senting, Zheng Renye, Zhou Jingzhai, Ni Wenqing, Tang Zhiqing, etc. Shi Zhikun presided, and Zeng Xingwu recorded the proceedings. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by reports from various businesses: (1) Yongtaifeng Company reported the penalties they had received: A. Minor discrepancies in tax amounts. B. Omissions in the registration of items on customs declarations and permits (two and a half mace for permits, two and a half mace for unsigned declarations, two and a half mace for omissions of color). The customs euphemistically calls these penalties "handling fees," which are also known as "late fees." C. Restrictions on the time allowed for short-haul reporting. All of the above should be improved by the customs. (2) Taiguchang Company reported: A. If goods are returned and not exported, regulations require that the return be cancelled. However, the customs requires that returned goods, whether exported or not, must be inspected again before the cancellation can be completed. However, most returns are due to mismatched prices. If reinspection is required, there will be additional transportation costs. Furthermore, the customer may not allow the seller to reinspect the goods because the seller does not agree to the reinspection, and it is impossible to force the customer to bring the goods for reinspection. B. When the customs inspection room is crowded with returned goods, it can be requested that customs officials be dispatched from other gates to assist in the inspection. Recently, many of the newly arrived customs officials have been inexperienced, and their inspection is inadequate. There are a large number of returned goods every day, but they do not allow the dispatch of other customs officials to assist in the inspection, ignoring the losses of the industry. This should be improved. C. Customs valuation should adopt current market prices and fair valuation. In addition, economic contraction recently has made goods cheaper every day, but customs valuation is always based on previous market prices, not current prices. When they are negotiated with, they just said universal fraud is punishable. This should be improved. (3) Dachanglong Company reported that the customs has changed its regulations and that declarations must be stopped by 11:30AM, which often results in late inspections and various losses from returns. It should be based on previous regulations, until 3 PM. (4) Taiguhui Company reported that red slips were omitted, and a request was made to reissue them. However, customs officials must view the original declarations and demand a fee of one tael and five mace of silver before reissuing them. This should also be improved. There are many other reports from each company, which are not detailed here. It was immediately decided to request improvements from the customs to relieve commercial difficulties. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM.</p>

<h3>The Tax Office Instructs the Shangbao Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>▲ Regarding the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax</p>
<p>The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance issued an instruction to the Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau, instructing the public bureau to state: "The previous case in which the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association and others accused the chief of the Shangbao License Tax Branch of threatening and imposing harsh taxes has been clarified by this office in accordance with the departmental regulations, and the bureau was informed accordingly. Now, the association and others have submitted a statement arguing against the departmental regulations and making unreasonable arguments. The license tax has been allocated to local funds and is related to the income of the provinces and cities. Therefore, a copy of the original statement of the association is issued, instructing the bureau to immediately investigate strictly. If the association and others dare to harbor resistance to payment, it should immediately consult with the Shanghai Municipal Government to severely investigate and deal with it, in order to warn the cunning and respect the tax policy. Furthermore, what is the truth about the statement in the original presentation that the bureau chief collected two yuan and four yuan more from the Fenjiu industry which is specialized by government. It should also be investigated and reported, and the branch chief should be instructed to collect taxes in accordance with the regulations to avoid leaving a bad impression. This is of utmost importance." "After receiving this, it was found that the association had previously submitted a statement to the bureau, which had been severely criticized. Now, in accordance with the previous reason, Xu Zhize, the chief of the Shangshu Stamp Tax Branch, was specially dispatched to jointly investigate the truth with the branch chief and report it fairly. In addition to the distribution order, the original document is issued, instructing the branch chief to immediately comply and report on the situation of the winter multiplier license for the exclusive sale of Fenjiu, and whether it is handled in accordance with the regulations. Do not delay."</p>
<h3>Three Commissioners from the Ministry of Communications Arrive in Shanghai to Thoroughly Investigate the Pu Yifan Case</h3>
<p>After the Communist leader Chen Duxiu was arrested, it was discovered that Pu Yifan was also an important suspect in the case and had many connections. It has now been confirmed by the Central Government that Pu Yifan was the chief of the translation section of the secretariat of the Shanghai China Merchants Bureau. A few days before the case, the section was resolved by Li Guojie's decree, and Pu was reassigned as a clerk in the shipping department, continuing to work as usual. This incident occurred because Pu dared to hide his tracks in a state-owned institution, and the investigation revealed a great deal. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications specially sent two commissioners and one technician, who arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday to thoroughly investigate the truth of the Pu case. After arriving in Shanghai, the ministry commissioners went to the secretariat of the China Merchants Bureau to investigate Pu's behavior in the bureau and the circumstances of the various matters he handled. The three commissioners took this case very seriously.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Prepares Wages for Five Wharves Yesterday</h3>
<p>The dispute over the workers of the China Merchants Bureau's five wharves demanding the payment of their September wages was resolved through negotiation and a decision was made to pay them yesterday. At that time, Yu Xianting and others, the standing members of the five wharves workers' union, went to the general office to negotiate with Secretary Cai and others. However, due to the bureau's severe financial difficulties, it was temporarily unable to raise the funds. The union was well aware of the difficulties and, in the interest of cooperation, the accounting department first paid half a month's wages to all the workers at the five wharves, which was a signed check that could only be collected on the morning of the next day. The remaining half month's wages were advanced by the heads of each warehouse. The union will advise the workers, and fortunately, no incidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Donggou Botanical Garden Holds Grand Chrysanthemum Exhibition</h3>
<p>▲ Extremely Crowded with Tourists in Recent Days</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Ferry Commissioner Receives Guests</p>
<p>The Donggou Botanical Garden, affiliated with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, has traditionally held a chrysanthemum exhibition once a year.

<h3>No Hope for Reconciliation in the Sheng Family Inheritance Case</h3>
<p>▲ Both Parties Unwilling to Reconcile</p>
<p>▲ Fu Jiren to Testify Again at Retrial</p>
<p>The sons, brothers, nieces, and sisters of the late Sheng Xuanhuai, including Sheng Zecheng, filed a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court against their nephews Shao Yunjuan and others, accusing the Sheng family of forging Sheng Zhuang's will and infringing on their rightful rights. After repeated trials, an order was issued to reconcile outside the court, as reported in previous newspapers. Because both parties have no intention of reconciliation, Shen Bingrong, a judge of the court, opened a hearing in the afternoon yesterday. First, the plaintiff's lawyer Chen Ming stated the reasons why reconciliation could not proceed. Judge Shen then asked the defendant Sheng Zecheng for his opinion on why he could not reconcile. According to Sheng, although the surface of this case is the same as the previous case filed by Lin Fengwen, the actual situation is very different. Because Lin is poor and his purpose is money, it is not difficult to reconcile. However, the plaintiff in this case has more than one million in property, which is almost richer than the plaintiff, so the purpose of his accusation is not money, and the element of reconciliation is money, so it is difficult to reconcile. Moreover, the conditions proposed by the opposing party are absolutely difficult to accept, and only a court decision can be requested in accordance with the law. If the opposing party has a sincere intention of reconciliation, it must first withdraw the criminal lawsuit. The defendant is also in a difficult situation, and does not know how to be grateful for the court's intention to settle the matter. Judge Shen then asked the plaintiff for his opinion. According to Shao Yunpeng, I cannot lose any of the rights I deserve. Judge Shen said that if this is the case, there is no hope of reconciliation, so he asked the plaintiff's father whether he could ask his children to concede. According to his reply, if the defendant can accept the reconciliation plan, he may speak to his children. At this time, the defendant Sheng Pinchen stated that this case was originally regarded as a trial, but the other party should not file a criminal complaint because of the money issue, so the mediation is very difficult. The court then determined that both parties were indeed unwilling to reconcile, and immediately announced that the trial would proceed in order to avoid delays. The plaintiff's lawyer then requested that the witness Li Puchen be summoned again to the case and questioned again, but Li and others did not appear in court yesterday, so the trial was still not conducted. Judge Shen ordered that the date be changed to summon the witnesses to court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Corpse Examination in Wuxi Road</h3>
<p>At 0:30 am the day before yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at Dasheng Silk Store at No. 125 Wuxi Road North. At that time, the fire started from the stairs downstairs, so it was late at night. It was not easy for the people living upstairs to escape when they found out, resulting in four people being burned to death on the spot and several others injured. The fire brigade arrived after hearing the alarm and extinguished the fire, and the dead bodies were taken out. The Lao Zha Police Station was notified and ordered to send detectives to investigate. It was found that one of the dead was Zheng A'er, a four-year-old boy, one was Zheng Qinshi, a thirty-year-old woman, one was Ji Shutang, a seven-year-old boy, and one was Ji Xianghua, a ten-year-old girl. All four corpses were carried by the police station to the corpse examination center on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Zhan Liangce, the prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, came to the center to examine the corpses and made a public announcement. According to the testimony of Ji Dai, a native of Huzhou, Ji Shutang is my son, and Ji Xianghua is my daughter. At that time, they were unable to save them, resulting in their being burned to death. According to Qin Shousheng's testimony, Zheng Qinshi is my sister, and Zheng A'er is my niece. Now, I request to collect the corpses because my brother-in-law Zheng Haoru also broke his leg in the attempt to escape and is currently being treated in the hospital. Mr. Zhan then announced that the deceased Zheng Qinshi, female, Zheng A'er, girl, Ji Shutang, boy, Ji Xianghua, girl, all died of burns before death. The corpses of Zheng Qinshi and Zheng A'er were handed over to Qin Shousheng to collect and coffin, and the corpses of Ji Shutang and Ji Xianghua were handed over to Ji Dai to collect and coffin.</p>
<h3>Fire Compensation Association Sends Letter to Foreign Merchant Insurance Brokers</h3>
<p>▲ Please Ask Local Bank to Issue Public Bonds</p>
<p>The Chinese merchants have passed the issuance of public bonds to resolve the fire insurance compensation problem in the disaster area of Shanghai. However, the foreign merchants have not yet expressed their opinions, and the policyholders are in deep water and fire, and they are in urgent need of compensation to relieve them. Therefore, they have urged the Association to proceed and submitted their opinions. Tang Youwei of the Association accepted the opinions of the policyholders and promised to submit them to the executive committee for discussion. The 14th executive committee meeting resolved to send these opinions to the 63 foreign merchant insurance brokers for local guidance, and to resolve the issue as soon as possible. The original letter sent by the Association to the foreign merchant insurance companies is as follows: "To the esteemed Sir, we recently received letters from the disaster-stricken policyholders, stating that since the Association received the instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau and published the announcement asking the policyholders to wait patiently for processing, several sentences have passed. Yesterday, we saw news reports and inquired from the Association, and learned that after the insurance association instructed the insurance association to discuss the method, the Chinese merchant insurance association has expressed its approval for the issuance of public bonds, while the foreign merchants have not yet expressed their opinions. The Social Affairs Bureau has informed the foreign merchant insurance industry association to handle it in unison. However, considering that the development of foreign merchant operations depends entirely on the assistance of our Chinese people to achieve this achievement, the foreign merchants and Chinese merchants should stand in the same position and handle it in unison to resolve this compensation method in the disaster area. Therefore, we hope that the Chinese managers or brokers who work in foreign merchant insurance companies should immediately explain the principle of issuing public bonds to the foreign merchants in their respective companies, which is to be used for the policyholders and taken from the policyholders, and will not affect the insurance industry itself. Moreover, using public bonds to resolve this dispute will greatly increase the credibility and emotion of the insurance industry in the future. Therefore, a thorough consideration is originally a beneficial and harmless thing, etc. Our association believes that the sections mentioned are still reasonable, and especially convey the truth. I have always believed that you, like me, are descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and you will definitely sympathize with the disaster-stricken and helpless compatriots. Moreover, you are close to the foreign merchants morning and evening, and it will only take a small amount of effort to solve the plight of hundreds of thousands of souls, benefit the disaster-stricken people, and benefit the dried fish. You will definitely not let the Chinese merchant insurance industry be beautiful alone."</p>
<h3>Wife of 44 Years Suspects Husband of Having an Affair and Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>▲ Husband Greets Neighbor Woman</p>
<p>▲ Wife Becomes Suspicious and Hangs Herself</p>
<p>The woman Geng Cai, 43 years old, and her husband Geng Jinsheng, lived at No. 33 Qianxin Fang, Huade Road. On the 28th of last month, she suspected that her husband had an affair with the neighbor Wang Dong, which led to an argument. The next morning at about 5 o'clock, Geng Jinsheng went out to work and returned home at 12 o'clock at noon. He saw that his wife was not there, and the door of the bedroom was also locked, so he thought that his wife had gone to a relative's house. Geng went to visit the place, but she was not there. He returned home and found that his wife was hanging from the beam in the bedroom. He pried the door open and untied her, but she had already died. Geng reported to Chinese Constable No. 2562 and went to Huishan Police Station to report. The police station ordered detectives to investigate. When they arrived at the scene, they saw that the deceased's clothes had been changed, so they carried the body to the forensic examination center on Philun Road. Yesterday morning, they reported to the First Special District Court and appointed Prosecutor Zhan Liangce to come to the center to examine the body and make a public announcement. According to the report of the corpse's husband, Geng Jinsheng, 43 years old, a native of Yancheng, who works in the Public Works Bureau, the deceased is my wife, and we have been married for 24 years. I had an argument with her on the 27th. I went to the vegetable market to buy vegetables and met Wang Dong, so we greeted each other. After she found out, she suspected that I had an affair with the woman, but in fact, there was no such thing. He also said that the door was not locked by me. There is a small window on the side of the door of the room. People inside the room can lock the door from the window. I did not know that she was hanging herself, so I went out to look for her everywhere. Later, I saw her hanging through the small window by Yu Zhaolin, so I found out, etc. According to the testimony of Liu Hongkui, who lived together, Geng had to go out at 5 am every morning. I saw the deceased fanning a coal stove in the living room at about 8 am when I went out that morning. After returning home, I helped them untie the deceased, etc. After obtaining the confession, Mr. Zhan announced that the deceased Geng Cai, female, was indeed hanged to death before death. The cause of her hanging death is still under investigation. The corpse's husband, Geng Jinsheng, was taken back to the police station for interrogation, and the corpse was handed over to the corpse's son, Geng Zhaolin, to collect and coffin.</p>
<h3>Yang Bingchang Was Repeatedly Assassinated by Zhao Xilin</h3>
<p>▲ Witness Saw the Defendant at the Scene of the Incident</p>
<p>▲ The Defendant Denies Joining the Communist Party in His Hometown</p>
<p>Zhao Xilin, a native of Changzhou who used to be a detective in the Changzhou Public Security Bureau, became an inspector at Shenxin No. 9 Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road after he stole the goods and came to Shanghai. However, Zhao had many enemies. He was shot and injured by bandits in his hometown while arresting thieves. At 6 am on August 22nd of last year, he was shot and attacked twice by his enemies in front of the Shenxin Yarn Factory in Shanghai, and was also seriously injured. At that time, stray bullets injured Zhang Wenjin from Jiangyin and Li Liantang from Shaoxing, who died one after another. At 6 pm on June 13th of this year, Zhao and his fourth concubine, a Nanjing woman named Jiang, were shot and assassinated by their enemies near Wanxingfang on Yangshupu Road, and were killed by a bullet in a vital part. Shen Yuzhou and Ji Liren, the Chinese detectives of the Yangshupu Police Station, arrested the perpetrator Tang Bingchang, a native of Changzhou, at No. 43, Qitaitou, and sent him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zhen opened a trial. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station, stated the case, saying, "After investigation, it was found that the defendant was the culprit in the second case of Zhao Xilin being shot three times. The defendant's claim in the police station and the previous trial that he invited the fugitives Quanquan and Shengyun to help him is completely false. It was found that the defendant used to be one of the big bandits in his hometown, and Zhao Xilin arrested him many times without success when he was working in the Changzhou Public Security Bureau. The defendant had a deep grudge against Zhao. That morning, he invited his accomplices Quanquan and Shengyun to wait near the Shenxin Yarn Factory. After a while, the defendant pointed out Zhao Xilin himself to his accomplices, who shot him and fell to the ground. Later, Zhao said in the hospital that the instigator was the defendant, and a confession was recorded. Therefore, the defendant is actually the principal offender in this case. Zhao Xilin is dead, and his concubine Jiang has now arrived in court to testify." Then, Zhao's confession in the hospital was presented. He also said that after the conclusion of this case, the Changzhou Public Security Bureau would send detectives to transfer the defendant. According to Zhao Jiang's testimony, she knew the defendant, whose name was Tang Bingchang, who was a member of the Changzhou Communist Party. Because her husband Xilin arrested him and accumulated grudges, she was at home when her husband was shot and killed in front of the Shenxin Yarn Factory, but she knew that the defendant did it. According to the witness Xu Sihai, he knew both Zhao Xilin and the defendant. At that time, Zhao was shot and injured, and he saw the defendant at the scene. I was scared and ran away. According to the witness Zhang Xiaomao, a native of Jiangyin, Zhang Wenjin, who was injured by the stray bullet, was my father. At that time, he was injured and fell to the ground in front of the pancake shop opposite the factory. However, I did not know the defendant. According to the woman Li Zhang from Shaoxing, Li Liantang was my husband, who used to be a handyman. He was injured by a stray bullet at that time and died soon after. When asked, the defendant denied joining the Communist Party in his hometown. A friend named Quanquan came to my house and told me to go out shopping with him. When we arrived near the Shenxin Yarn Factory, he told me what he wanted to do. I refused, and he wanted to kill Zhao first. Later, I saw Shengyun shoot and kill Zhao Xilin. I was just acting as a lookout. Judge Wu appointed lawyer Fan Gang to defend the defendant and ordered Tang Bingchang to be remanded in custody for sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>

<h3>Fire at Match Factory Caused by Carelessness; Dog Was the Culprit</h3>
<p>▲ Yingchang Warehouse Drives Out Stray Dogs</p>
<p>Six sections of warehouse No. 2 at the Yingchang Match Factory in Lujiadu, Pudong, were destroyed by fire on the 24th of last month due to carelessness, resulting in losses amounting to more than ten thousand taels of silver. A subsequent investigation into the cause of the fire revealed that the warehouse door was tightly locked, leaving factory personnel baffled. It was initially suspected that rats were the cause. However, yesterday, factory workers discovered the charred remains of a dog while cleaning up the site. This confirmed that the dog was the culprit. It is believed that the dog sneaked into the warehouse to steal paste when workers were pasting trademark labels on matchboxes. After the workers finished and locked the door, the dog was unable to escape. It frantically gnawed and barked at the matchboxes, causing the match heads to rub against the striking surface and ignite a fire, which quickly spread. The dog became a victim of the blaze. Having learned from this incident, the factory authorities issued an order to expel all stray dogs from the factory premises.</p>
<h3>Autopsy in Case of Russian Child Killed by Car</h3>
<p>A Russian child named Aul Lauv (transliteration), eight years old, residing at No. 145 Jinshenfu Road in the French Concession, left home at 4:00 PM on the 30th of last month. While crossing the road from west to east in front of No. 127 of the same road, he was struck by a cargo truck, license number 1563F, belonging to Fusheng Company, driven by Shen Axing, a chauffeur residing at No. 688 Xujiahui Road, which was speeding by. The child was unable to avoid the collision and suffered a fractured skull, resulting in immediate death. The police arrived, took Shen and the truck to the Central Police Station, and transported the body to the autopsy facility on Tallas Tuo Road.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the French General Police Department's Traffic Division reported the case to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Deng Baosun, along with a forensic doctor, clerk, and interpreter, were dispatched to the facility to conduct the autopsy. The autopsy confirmed that the deceased died from a head injury caused by a car accident. The family of the deceased had not yet arrived. The prosecutor questioned the defendant, Shen Axing, about the circumstances of the accident and ordered the body to be held for the family to claim. The defendant was sent to court by the Traffic Division for further questioning.</p>

<p>The Rumor of a Breakdown in Negotiations is Inaccurate</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that rumors circulated today that negotiations on the issue of installing concession telephones on roads built over the border had broken down again.

<h3>Chartered Car Driver Plans to Organize Gang to Rob Owner's Property</h3>
<p>▲ Previously Discussed at a Teahouse</p>
<p>Liu Jinsheng, a native of Dongshan, Dongting, is a silk merchant residing at No. 2, Lane 85, Tongfu Road. At 9:45 PM on October 29, Liu left a bookstore in Leyu Lane, Yunnan Road, and took his chartered car home, driven by the chartered car driver Zhuang A San. While passing the intersection of Dagu Road and Tongfu Road, three robbers suddenly blocked the road. One robber pulled out a pistol, forbidding any noise. They robbed Liu of fifty yuan in cash and a cigarette case before fleeing in different directions. Liu shouted for help, and two Chinese constables, No. 1183 and No. 525, heard the cry and rushed to the scene to help chase the robbers. They apprehended one robber on the spot, Yu Jinding, a native of Jiangbei. Yu confessed that he and Zhang Xia were the other two robbers and that they did not have a real pistol but used a glass tube as a fake pistol. He stated that the instigator of the robbery was actually Liu Jinsheng's chartered car driver, Shi Kui (i.e., A San). The police chief then dispatched Chinese detectives Ye Yushan and Yang Yunfeng to Zhuang's home in Zhabei to make an arrest, but they were unable to find him. By the day before yesterday, Zhuang, realizing that the situation was not good, dared not go to work at Liu's house and hired Gao Gengnian, a fellow villager, as a replacement, intending to take leave of absence on some pretext. However, detectives were waiting for him at Liu's house and arrested Zhuang. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Yu and Zhuang to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, presented the case, stating that the police investigation had revealed that the defendants had previously conspired to commit robbery at the Wansheng Teahouse on Xinmin Road, Zhabei. Zhang Xia and the other two had already fled. He requested a postponement of the hearing. Liu Jinsheng, the victim, also filed a case proving the circumstances of the robbery. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the confession and ordered the defendants to be detained and remanded for a seven-day investigation before the next hearing.</p>

<h3>Man and Woman Rescued After Jumping into River</h3>
<p>▲ Wu Yuqing Quarrels with Husband</p>
<p>▲ Chen Fengnian Falsely Accused of Theft</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM, a fashionable woman boarded ferry No. 6 at the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong to cross the river. Unexpectedly, upon reaching the center of the river, the woman suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide while people were not paying attention. Old man Li Lansheng used a bamboo pole to rescue her onto the boat, saving her life. She was sent to the Customs Water Police Station. The woman was wearing a modern cheongsam and leather shoes and appeared quite refined. After questioning by the police chief, she confessed that her name was Wu Yuqing, age twenty-five, a native of Guangdong, residing at a certain address on Wuchang Road. Due to a quarrel with her husband, she became despondent and took this drastic measure. Upon hearing this, the police chief immediately dispatched investigator No. 27 to inform her brother, Wu Minghuang, to come to the police station to take her home.</p>
<p>▲ The day before yesterday evening, a young man jumped into the river at the Longmaozhan Wharf in Pudong to commit suicide. Fortunately, a nearby guard noticed and immediately took steps to rescue him and take him to the Third District Police Station. After questioning by the district chief, he confessed that his name was Chen Fengnian, age nineteen, a native of Taicang. He used to be an apprentice at a rice shop in Zhabei. After the January 28th Incident, the shop closed down, and he drifted to Shanghai for eight or nine months. Unable to make ends meet, he returned home on the 18th of this month (i.e., last month). Unexpectedly, his uncle suddenly lost a padded robe and accused him of stealing it. Although I am poor to this point, I thought to myself that I would never steal. Therefore, I resentfully returned to Shanghai to commit suicide. Two pawn tickets and several unfinished suicide notes were found on his person. When asked if he had any relatives in Shanghai, he said that his brother-in-law, Yang Huinong, was an accountant at the Yongmaoxiang South Goods Store at the Damatou in Nanshi. Based on this information, the district chief ordered the police to bring Yang to the district to take him back and provide relief.</p>
<h3>Wusong District Fire Brigade Resumes Operations</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday's Fire Prevention Meeting</p>
<p>The fire brigades in the Wusong District of this city, divided into four sections: East District, Ningshang, Liangxi, and Wusong, had more than half of their fire-fighting equipment destroyed by enemy artillery fire after the January 28th Incident. After the situation stabilized, the responsible personnel of the fire brigades were mostly scattered. As a result, the fire-fighting equipment in the district had not yet been restored. Recently, the Wusong market has gradually revived, and the restoration of fire-fighting affairs is urgently needed. Yin Yuxin, secretary of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Dong Zhihe, director of the Fire Prevention Division, had already presented the matter to Director Wen and, with his approval, convened a meeting of Wusong District fire brigade members and municipal councilors at the bureau's conference room at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to resume Wusong's fire-fighting operations.

<h3>The Public Works Department Health Office Recruits Chinese Trainees</h3>
<p>In order to do its best to recruit Chinese personnel and train them in municipal services, the Public Works Department has now approved the recruitment of four additional Chinese trainees in the Health Office this year. One of them is Mr. Shen Dingyi, who was recruited as an alternate last year and has now been called to serve at the office. The remaining three, Mr. Chen Fengjun, Mr. Ma Chonggao, and Mr. Wu Guanjie, were recruited through this year's examination. Trainees are on probation for the first year. During this period, in addition to learning the duties of health inspectors, they also undergo physical training. The training period lasts approximately six and a half years. Upon completion and passing the examination, they are eligible to be appointed as junior inspectors, with a starting salary of 250 yuan. After three years, they may be promoted to formal inspectors, with salary paid in accordance with bureau regulations. All trainees must undergo an examination after each year of training. The examination focuses on public health in this city. The ability to promote or continue training depends on the results of the examination. Those who are diligent and capable may have their training period shortened by the head of the Health Office. The Health Office recruited eight trainees last year. Together with those recruited this time, there are now a total of twelve. Of the three trainees recruited this year, two are students of the Public Works Department Yucai Public School, and one is a student of the Huatong Public School. All of them had previously taken the entrance examination for the University of Hong Kong. Mr. Shen Dingyi is a student of the YMCA Middle School.</p>
<h3>Opium Den Owner Dies from Eating Poisoned Food</h3>
<p>Chen Yingcai Had Malicious Intent</p>
<p>Tang Hongquan, a local resident in his forties, from Tangjiazhai, Qiujiang Bridge, Jungong Road, Hudong, runs an opium den at that location. Opium addicts often come and go. Chen Yingcai, a fruit seller, is also an opium addict and is a regular at Tang's opium den. Sometimes he has a meal at Tang's place. On the 28th of last month, Chen smoked opium at Tang's place and then had lunch there. Unexpectedly, after Tang took the rice for a moment, Chen did not eat it and poured the rice back into the pot. At 3:00 PM, Tang wanted to eat, so he ate the rice that Chen had poured back. After finishing, he felt severe abdominal pain. His wife was horrified and believed that the rice must have been poisoned. She sent him to Shenxin Hospital for treatment. An examination confirmed that he had been poisoned. He died on the 30th due to ineffective treatment. The Fifth District Fourth Police Station reported the incident and arrested Chen. Yesterday, it ordered the bailiff Yang Genhua to report to the local court for an examination.</p>

<h3>Wusong Residents Snatch Fallen Cotton</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of the war this year, the planting of cotton and rice in the countryside around Wusong and Taiwan was delayed by a month. As a result, cotton is now in full bloom. However, a group of poor villagers and Jiangbei residents, who traditionally collect fallen cotton starting from the first day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar, formed groups of men, women, and children yesterday and snatched fallen cotton in the cotton fields. When the field owners saw this, they feared that they would not be able to recover their investment in planting and tried their best to chase them away. Unexpectedly, these people relied on their numbers and speed and showed no fear, leaving the field owners helpless. Fortunately, Sun, the platoon leader of the Second Defense Squad of the Taiwan Garrison Regiment, learned of the situation and led his team to stop them and disperse the residents. The field owners expressed their gratitude. It is reported that the Municipal Government has already issued a notice banning the collection of fallen cotton and posted it in the surrounding villages.</p>

<h3>China Harmonica Association Hosts Banquet for Brigade Commander Weng</h3>
<p>The national hero General Weng Zhaoyuan has been in Shanghai for many days, and various sectors have hosted banquets every evening. The China Harmonica Association had previously led a harmonica team to the front lines to play and comfort the soldiers when the 19th Route Army retreated to the second line of defense, earning the praise of various division and brigade commanders and soldiers. They had a particular fondness for Brigade Commander Weng. Therefore, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 30th), they hosted a farewell banquet for Weng at the New YMCA on the ninth floor and held the second general membership dinner. First, Chairman Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, saying, "Brigade Commander Weng resolutely defended the Wusongkou, vowing never to retreat. This shows the importance of this port. Harmonica playing also relies entirely on the mouth. This mouth and that port can be considered equally important." The audience erupted in applause. Then, Brigade Commander Weng gave a speech, speaking about the relationship between the air force and national defense, emphasizing that our country urgently needs to prepare in time. The harmonica is a folk music instrument and should also be vigorously promoted. In the future, if a harmonica team can play on airplanes, then both will be popularized. The witty words were brilliant. Weng is not only a model soldier but also an orator. After the speech, everyone raised their glasses. Then, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, gave a speech, advocating efforts to promote the harmonica. Later, Ms. He Zhixing of the Hangzhou Branch of the association played "Autumn Moon in the Han Palace" on the harmonica to entertain the guests. Next, Chairman Wang Qingxun gave a thank-you speech and played two songs solo. The association's harmonica team then performed a grand ensemble of "Song of the 19th Route Army" and "Riding the Wind and Breaking the Waves" to bid farewell to Weng. At the sound of the third bell, the meeting was adjourned amidst the music. It is reported that new membership registration for this month is now open, and classes will begin soon.</p>

It was submitted to the Health Department of the Ministry of Interior last month on the 18th, requesting approval.

The submitted regulations are currently under study and drafting, and the association's opinions are being solicited for adoption. The original instructions are recorded as follows: "We have learned from the report that the association is dedicated to saving the people, which is commendable. Leprosy has always been considered a serious disease, and it is contagious, so it is necessary to establish special laws as a basis for management. However, the implementation of current regulations requires the establishment of leprosy hospitals in various places for accommodation. Comprehensive planning is also necessary for social customs and sources of revenue. In view of the local conditions, it cannot be achieved overnight. The department is currently studying and drafting the regulations. The association can submit any opinions or suggestions at any time for consideration. This is to be informed."</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>I read a piece in the local news section of your newspaper on the 30th of this month about the strike of garment and fashion workers and the consultation methods of party and government agencies. It said that Zhou Funong, director of the People's Training Section of the Municipal Party Department, and Xu Yefu, chief of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, consulted on the handling methods yesterday. Upon investigation, the two parties are currently verifying the matter, and there have been no consultations on the handling methods. It is obviously a false rumor. I am writing to you to request that you check and publish a correction in the "Letters to the Editor" column. I am very grateful for your kindness. This is to the editor of Shen Bao, Xu Yefu, Zhou Funong, and Zhou Qi, October 31st.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Greetings. I have just read in yesterday's newspaper about the British-American Tobacco Factory in Pudong issuing savings to workers. The details stated therein are slightly different from the facts. Upon investigation, in 1922, due to the increase in the cost of living and the low wages (only 3 jiao and 6 fen), the workers of the British-American Tobacco Factories No. 1 and No. 2 requested the factory to increase wages by 10%, but the management refused, causing a labor strike that lasted nearly two months. The factory management knew that a long strike would affect business, so it used one-tenth of the 13% wage increase requested by the workers as a charitable fee, 40% as a year-end bonus, and 50% as worker savings, without increasing wages. At that time, during the warlord era, the workers had to bear the pain. Therefore, this savings fund was obtained through the struggle of more than 8,000 workers in the entire factory, and it was not an unexpected benefit from the factory. I hope your editor will grant permission to publish this letter so that all sectors can understand the contents. I am very grateful. This is to respectfully wish you good writing. Shanghai Fifth District Cigarette Industry Workers' Union, October 31, 1932.</p>

<h3>Advocating Short Clothing</h3>
<p>— Buddhist</p>
<p>Our publication has added a section for the "Social Reform Discussion Society," and the first thing advocated is the reform of clothing. This is because "long gowns and mandarin jackets" not only perpetuate the old Qing dynasty traditions, but are also cumbersome. Wearing Western suits is merely picking up other people's ideas and following in their footsteps. We should create our own most suitable form of clothing. This issue has been discussed for a long time, but due to circumstances, there is still no concrete solution. However, the majority advocate for student-style clothing, as it is the most suitable because it is simple and convenient.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper that "Yang Sen of Sichuan believes that long gowns and wide belts not only fail to invigorate the spirit, but also cause many inconveniences in movement. He strongly advocates short clothing and has issued an order that people within the defense zone are no longer allowed to wear long gowns. He has also instructed the police to patrol the streets with sharp scissors and cut off the lower section of anyone still wearing a long gown." I deeply agree with this method, but within my agreement, there are some dissenting opinions, namely, the lack of a universally adopted clothing style. Since the Xinhai Revolution, women's clothing has undergone countless changes, with all sorts of strange and bizarre things emerging, promoting extravagance and displaying odd shapes. I do not approve of this type of change. I also do not approve of Mr. Ma's old cotton-padded jacket and the wide cloth belt around his waist, as this type of clothing seems too sanctified. What I advocate is a student-style form of clothing, with the primary condition being the use of domestic goods as raw materials.</p>
<p>However, this issue is not a matter of knowing, but a matter of doing. If we only talk about it on paper and are unwilling to promote its implementation, it is meaningless. Therefore, I propose gathering a few like-minded comrades and having everyone wear it first to demonstrate our advocacy. During the Warring States period, King Wuling of Zhao wanted to adopt nomadic clothing and archery to teach the people, which aroused opposition from a group of conservative ministers. However, King Wuling firmly rejected public opinion, "saying that clothing is for the benefit of the body, and education is for the changing of affairs. The purpose of clothing is to standardize the common people, not to judge the virtuous." It can be seen that reforming old habits was difficult for the ancients. Although the current national ideology does not entirely lean towards archaism, there are still many gentlemen who believe that not wearing loose robes and wide belts is insufficient to express the attitude of our great nation and insufficient to express one's personal character. They are deeply surprised that they would not let go of a long gown and mandarin jacket until death.</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, the only so-called national and people's benefit has been the cutting off of the three thousand worries (hair). At the beginning of the cutting, due to being uncommon and strange, people looked at each other and laughed, also feeling it was odd. Now, if we see someone with a long braid, we will surely regard them as strange and stubborn. Reforming clothing is no different from this. Today, those who consider long gowns and mandarin jackets to be decent, how do they know that in the future they will not be viewed as monsters, just like those with long braids? Therefore, if anyone agrees with our publication's advocacy of short clothing and proposes its implementation, please send a letter to</p>
<p>our publication, to gauge the psychology of the general public.</p>

<h3>Medicated Soap</h3>
<p>— Tao Hong</p>
<p>Daily disinfection work! This just means using medicated soap when disinfecting skin or washing clothes; it is also a very necessary thing. Now I will write down how to make it:</p>
<p>First, you need to make a soap mold, and then add the medicine. For example, carbolic soap can be made according to the following method.</p>
<p>1.  Twenty pounds of coconut oil, four pounds of refined butter or mutton tallow, twenty pounds of sodium carbonate solution (Baumé specific gravity 33 1/40), one pound of carbolic acid.</p>
<p>Stir the liquefied butter into the soda ash solution at a temperature of 113 degrees Fahrenheit. When it starts to combine, add the coconut oil, and finally add the carbolic acid. The latter must be mixed extremely evenly, and then poured into the mold with extremely quick means, covered well, and allowed to dry before use. But instead of carbolic acid, you can use two pounds of sulfur flowers, which is the method for making sulfur soap. Sulfur soap can also be used to kill bacteria.</p>
<p>2.  Two hundred parts of cottonseed oil (by weight), three hundred parts of alcohol (90%), three hundred and twenty-five parts of water, forty-five parts of caustic soda, ten parts of potassium carbonate, fifty parts of ether, and twenty-five parts of carbolic acid.</p>
<p>Mix cottonseed oil with 100 parts of water, 200 parts of alcohol;</p>
<p>45 parts of caustic soda in a large bottle. After the saponification reaction starts, dissolve the remaining alcohol and potassium carbonate in the remaining water, and finally add carbolic acid and ether (i.e., de-). Add the above two items together into the large bottle in front, and shake the whole thing again. This mixture must be placed in a tightly covered bottle and stored at room temperature (70 degrees Fahrenheit). When using it, take it out and wash the items in water. One spoonful of medicated water is enough for an ordinary washbasin of water.</p>
<p>Coal tar soap: Mix 200 parts of coal tar with 400 parts of olive oil, heat slightly, and then filter. Put this filtered liquid in a water pot and heat it again, combining this liquid with the alcohol and potassium carbonate solution. Because olive oil belongs to a type of oleic acid fatty acid, it has an acidic reaction. At this point, soap will form, then add a percentage of alcohol, it is best to bring a little more olive oil, to make the excess kind re-neutralize. Then bring in a thousandth of glycerin. This soap contains 22% coal tar, which can be increased or decreased as needed. If you add two parts of distilled water, you can prevent any traces from being left on the edge of the basin.</p>
<p>Note: One part of distilled water rises to one thousand cubic millimeters (C.C.0, i.e., one kilogram, which equals 2.679 pounds, which equals 1.677 of our national sixteen-tael catty).</p>
<p>The specific gravity of glycerin and water is 1.27, so one thousand cubic centimeters of glycerin is 1.27 kilograms or 2.129 national catties.</p>
<p>The specific gravity of ether is 0.72, so one thousand cubic centimeters is 0.72 kilograms. The specific gravity of alcohol 90/70 is 0.834, so one thousand cubic centimeters is 0.834 kilograms. One kilogram is equal to 1.677 catties in our country. Readers can follow the previously matched table and calculate according to this section. Several kinds of liquids can be measured with measuring cups instead of scales.</p>

<h3>My Views on Improving Children</h3>
<p>— Fei Fei</p>
<p>Parents only know how to love their children, but they don't know what the method of love is. This is very regrettable!</p>
<p>Generally speaking: parents do not care about what children need physically and mentally? They casually provide things, whatever keeps them warm, whatever fills their stomachs... and think they have fulfilled their parental obligations. I don't think that's the case. There should be restrictions on what they wear and restrictions on what they eat. Now, I will put aside the eating restrictions and first give a few examples of the bleak situation in the clothing aspect:</p>
<p>In Chinese society, it is not uncommon for parents to wear unclean clothes, because children are easily imitated, and soon, they will naturally become assimilated.</p>
<p>When winter comes, parents dress their children without understanding what is warm for them. They only know to add one piece of clothing after another, dressing them like "door gods," so that the children's ability to move is completely eliminated. Moreover, physical development is also greatly hindered. When children want to wear new clothes, parents occasionally allow it, but what they make are long gowns and mandarin jackets, which make them look like "prematurely aged."</p>
<p>Children who are only seven or eight years old, living in this kind of rigid family, have strange phenomena emerge one after another. They wear their father's shoes, their brother's pants, and their sister's hat, and walk to show their mother. Their mother does not try to understand them in any way, but instead praises them for being very funny.</p>
<p>As described above, we as parents do not improve our own personalities, nor do we conform to the current trend.</p>
<p>In the past, European and American countries were also like this, but they produced Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Froebel... etc.: loudly shouting about children's education, children's facilities, caring for children, etc. From then on, children received a blessing.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, we should hurry up and improve, and it won't be too late! I will write down the following:</p>
<p>(1) When making children's clothes, first ask them what colors, styles, and materials they like? Let them decide for themselves, and then purchase them with them.</p>
<p>(2) Clothes should not be too tight or too loose, but should be slightly larger than the child's body to be considered qualified.</p>
<p>(3) When in sunlight, children can wear fewer clothes. When the weather is colder in the morning and evening, they can wear more clothes.</p>
<p>(4) When children take off their own clothes, they should tidy them up and have them put them away themselves, so that they can understand the spirit of autonomy and develop the habit of diligence and thrift.</p>
<p>(5) After children enter school, they will naturally have school uniforms, but children who have not yet entered school can adopt Sun Yat-sen suits and student uniforms from domestic goods merchants.</p>
<p>(6) As for shoes, it is okay to purchase them from merchants or make them yourself, but the size and style should be appropriate and fit the child's psychology.</p>
<p>(7) A baseball cap is the best type of hat, as it can block sunlight.</p>
<p>(8) When getting up in the morning, clothes, hats, shoes, and socks should be tidied up before going out.</p>
<p>(9) The family needs equipment such as dressing mirrors, coat racks, and clothes brushes, etc., to straighten out any unkempt areas of clothing.</p>
<p>(10) The long gown and mandarin jacket ideology is not liked by children. Those 18th-century parents are still constantly making them. Now, I advocate overthrowing them all!</p>

<h3>Classroom Dynamics</h3>
<p>— Ji Jue</p>
<p>The mysterious bell of the university rang "Dang-." A university student who had just come out of the washroom, rubbing his eyes and carrying his books, hurriedly walked to the classroom to attend class. However, attending class is really a bitter thing! Sitting on a bench for an hour is really uncomfortable, but what can you do if you don't want to sit? Attendance is taken in class. If you miss one-fifth of the classes, you will not be allowed to participate in the final exam, and you will not even get credit. Wouldn't that be "all your previous efforts wasted"? No way, no way, not attending class is ultimately inappropriate.</p>
<p>So the clever university student still lazily walked to the classroom, but as soon as he reached the corridor, he suddenly stopped and said to K, who was walking towards him:</p>
<p>"Oh! Old K, sorry, please take attendance for me. I haven't had breakfast yet... Sorry! Thank you..." As he spoke, he raised his right hand and gave a quasi-military salute: then he calmly returned to the dormitory.</p>
<p>"Professor XXXS is shouting with a small card in his hand."</p>
<p>"Here..." K, who was in charge, immediately responded, but his voice was a bit low.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, who's taking attendance for someone else?" Professor S asked deliberately.</p>
<p>"Here. Who's taking attendance for someone else? XXX is me!"</p>
<p>"Hmph..." Professor S knew the inside story, but there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>After the attendance was taken, Professor S began to lecture. When he came to an important term, he turned around to write on the blackboard: K, who was sitting in the last row, saw the opportunity and, while the professor was not paying attention, approached the window and lightly jumped out, escaping in a puff of smoke. At this moment, the classroom unanimously made a sound of " " Professor S turned his head, but there was no movement. He didn't know what everyone was laughing at?</p>
<p>Just as Professor S was lecturing with great interest, "Wipe... Wipe... Wipe..." a continuous sound came from the floor in the classroom, and then some people had already stood up, holding their books and looking like they were about to leave their seats. "What's wrong, is class over?" Professor S asked inexplicably.</p>
<p>"Class has been over for a long time, haven't you heard?" the student who had already stood up replied. In an instant, everyone in the whole classroom dispersed in a hubbub, leaving Professor S alone. When he took out his watch and looked at it, there was still a quarter of an hour before class was over. He couldn't help but exclaim in vain, but there was nothing he could do, so he could only stare blankly and sigh...</p>
<p>"Skipping class, taking attendance for someone else, jumping out of the window, kicking the floor..." This is the unique dynamic in university classrooms. Heaven knows!</p>

<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Family Education</h3>
<p>— Rui Yucheng</p>
<p>In a magnificent factory hall, there were many dazzling decorations, which showed that it was a wealthy family. An old couple, both looking over fifty years old, sat in the chairs at the top.</p>
<p>(Old Man) Wife, you can't just live your life in a daze every day! I have worked hard all my life to earn this family fortune. Qingnian! Their son's name! He's always doing some short-lived public welfare for hundreds and hundreds of dollars! You have to persuade him too. After all, the son is raised by you!</p>
<p>(Old Woman) Yes, that's right. I can't stop him! A few days ago, he took five hundred yuan from me, saying that he was donating to the "Northeast Refugee Relief Association." Although I was reluctant in my heart, he is already a married man. Can I still beat him or scold him! "Children don't listen when they grow up." I really can't do anything!</p>
<p>While they were talking, Qingnian walked in quickly, greeted his parents, and then sat down and said: (Qingnian) Ma Zhanshan's son is here. He specially came to raise money for the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army. I have agreed to donate one thousand yuan. Please give me a check quickly!</p>
<p>(Old Man and Old Woman) (In unison) What? Another thousand yuan? Money doesn't come that easily!</p>
<p>(Qingnian) Only with a country can there be a home; if the country is destroyed, it is useless to have money! Now the Japanese pirates are about to destroy our country. It is rare to have anti-Japanese warriors who are desperately resisting. We are all citizens, so how can we not help their economy? If there is no food and pay, how can they fight? Do you really want to watch China perish and everyone become slaves?</p>
<p>(Old Man and Old Woman) We don't care if the country perishes or not, as long as we have money to live on! The country is not just ours, do we always have to pay? Young master! I advise you to enjoy yourself at home and not mess around outside like this!</p>
<p>(Qingnian) I can't reason with you old fools. I'm going to the bank to pay one thousand yuan! (After saying that, he got up and left. The old couple just watched his receding figure and sighed.)</p>
<p>(Old Man) If this goes on for a long time, the family property won't be enough for him to squander! I have to think of a way... (He lowered his head and pondered)</p>
<p>(Old Woman) I have an idea: (She looked around to make sure no one was there, and then continued in a low voice:) Why don't we persuade him to smoke opium? I guarantee he won't even bother to go out. With our family's wealth, as long as he stays put and keeps the business, he won't have to worry for the rest of his life!</p>
<p>(Old Man) (Triumphantly, he laughed loudly) Yes... yes... yes... But I'm afraid he won't fall for it. What should we do!</p>
<p>(Old Woman) Don't worry about that! I'll find a beautiful prostitute to come back and slowly lure him and persuade him: first use a white beauty trick, then use a black beauty trick: what do you think?</p>
<p>(Old Man) Good... good... good... Let's do that: but we have to keep it from our daughter-in-law!</p>
<p>(Old Woman) I'll send my daughter-in-law away and have her cousin take her away for a few days.</p>
<p>The old couple had made their plan, and they were indescribably happy.</p>

<p>Opening Remarks</p>
<h3>"Hundred Mile Gong"</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the publication of this newspaper's film special issue, there should be an opening speech as usual, just like a comedy in which a god official leaps onto the stage at the opening of a drama. There are no leaping god officials in cinemas, but there is also a piece of routine music with the same nature as the leaping god official, and this music is called "Hundred Mile Gong" Prelude. The three characters "Hundred Mile Gong" are transliterated sounds, and it can be said that they have meaning, or it can be said that they have no meaning.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of "Hundred Mile Gong"? The first purpose is to tell people that the movie is about to start, please be quiet. The second purpose is to take this opportunity to uplift the audience's spirits and make them happily appreciate the plot. To tell a joke, for example, a husband and wife, or a wife and husband, have caused trouble at home and run to the cinema, their anger still unabated, sitting sullenly in the cinema. When the "Hundred Mile Gong" sounds, their hearts are calmed and their anger is gone. Therefore, in these few minutes of music before the opening, they actually change their attitude to a calm and quiet one, and go to appreciate the interest in the play. Or, after watching the movie, the old man returns home and reconciles, and next time they come hand in hand. The cinema has inexplicably added a lot of business, and families have saved countless troubles. Isn't this the merit of playing the "Hundred Mile Gong"? However, it must be stated that if modern men and women come to the cinema together, under the myriad of lights, it is inconvenient to whisper to each other and communicate their feelings. When the "Hundred Mile Gong" sounds, their hearts throb, and they are glad that the silver light is dim, and they can soon hold hands without fear of being stared at. Then they have misunderstood the original meaning of the "Hundred Mile Gong." This kind of concept is definitely unacceptable to this publication, because although our publication advocates film as a form of entertainment, it is also slightly different from other similar publications. For example, when Confucius cracked a joke, there was still some dignity in his laughter. In terms of Shen Bao's age, he is already an old man in his sixties. Although he is mixing in the field of teenagers, it is also inconvenient to be too dissolute. This point I hope readers (that is, viewers) and contributors (that is, actors) pay attention to and forgive me. However, the topic must also be clearly identified, "Hundred Mile Gong" itself is not the main play, the main play is still behind. Our newspaper has been preparing for this film supplement for several months, and we have gathered a team that is still quite good. There are also several famous actors who have generously agreed to appear on stage. But the words are wrong again, this is a movie scene, not a drama circle, so I have to say that our theater has good films and many stars, and the appeal will not be too lacking. I, as the editor, must first play the "Hundred Mile Gong" like a leaping god official.</p>

<p>[Old Master's Army Heart</p>
<p>Old Master's Army has been screened at Carlton for three days. Today I will come to make a comment, I am not afraid of being laughed at as yesterday's news? However, because this film has many people</p>
<h3>The Hot Girl is Back</h3>
<p>The hot girl Clara Bow, after a long absence from the film world, is now back and will be filming a film at Fox, called Gali</p>
<p>HerSavage. The Chinese film title is not yet known because the film has not arrived, and it is not convenient to translate it. It is probably a very exciting film. It is said that Clara Bow has changed after a long absence and reunion. In the past, she was completely unwilling to be bound by any environment and was unrestrained in her appearance. Now it is said that she is much more dignified. Her deep boudoir secrets are also not casually told to others. Indeed, a daughter changes in eighteen years, so how can Clara Bow escape this rule?</p>
<p>criticize and say it is not good, so I also join in the fun and talk about it. This film is only about six thousand feet long, and the story is very simple, just finding some very interesting jokes in this plain and bland little story.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, this film has two themes. The first is to describe a socialite, as they are called in society. Although she herself does not appear on the screen, the impression she gives is already very deep. The second is to say that it is a big mistake for a man to be passive because of unrequited love, because in many cases, there is no love to talk about at all, so how can there be loss? Therefore, from beginning to end, this virtual woman is used as the central figure, and her photos are seen again and again, and this point is always present. This is precisely the good thing that runs through the film, and this is the soul of the film.</p>
<p>The scenery is indeed not very good, but the desert background is not bad. The iron order is just an introduction to the end of the film and is not important, and the two people's meritorious service is not filmed. It only goes as far as capturing the chief, without falling into the cliché of a big reunion and great wealth.</p>
<p>I am not saying that this film is necessarily very good, I am only saying that it is definitely not bad, because the films of the previous ten years were narrative and realistic. Now what we seek from films is art and allegory. Even transcending general great works of art, such as City Lights, cannot be completely reasonable. Luke Pescoden's historian is like this, so how can we deeply blame Laurel and Hardy with the three words "unqualified"?</p>
<p>The accompanying film that Carlton is paired with this time also has an introduction value, such as that five-color song and dance film (originally named Baby</p>
<p>Follies) is completely performed by child stars under the age of twelve or thirteen, doing stage plays. Among them, there are three little babies about six or seven years old, speaking unclearly, with a kind of natural innocence and cuteness to the extreme. They actually sang and danced, causing applause from the entire audience. There is also a sound dog film that deifies the performance of joys and sorrows. These two small dramas can also prove the progress of American films, training children and dogs to such an extent.</p>

<h3>Today, New Light is screening "Wasted Youth"! Starring Bowers, Ireland, and Dunn</h3>
<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>Modern Three Women (Star)</h3>
<p>Speaking of this name, all movie fans know that it is a famous Lianhua film that is about to be released.</p>
<p>In fact, the film does not depend on whether it is famous or not, but first on its content. Although this film was completely filmed at the end of last month, the editing has not yet started, and there has been no trial screening. How can we say whether it is good or bad?</p>
<p>However, at least its theme is a compass for modern young people. It shows people what true modernity is and depicts the failure of general women who misunderstand vanity and social interaction as modernity. In the end, it is a village girl who wins, because this village girl is the one who truly understands the true meaning of the two words "modernity."</p>
<p>This village girl is played by Ruan Lingyu, and her opponent is of course Jin Yan. Although I have seen them filming, I will not arbitrarily say it is good. At least with their reputation, I can say "it's still reliable, right?"</p>
<p>The reason I am introducing it is because the mistaken concept of modern youth can be corrected by it. Moreover, judging from experience, Lianhua's themes are mostly able to align with the times.</p>
<p>Local News Roundup</p>
<h3>Xuan Jinglin Changes to Playing Middle-Aged Women</h3>
<p>Since Xuan Jinglin returned to Shanghai from her performance in Changsha, she has been living a family life. Although various companies have invited her to film movies, the salary issue has not yet been resolved. Recently, Zhou Jianyun of the Star Film Company contacted her several times, and she has agreed to rejoin. However, the roles she will play from now on will not be young women, because of her age, she will specialize in middle-aged women's roles. Jinglin herself also believes that playing middle-aged women is more similar to her than playing young women.</p>
<h3>Yang Naimei's Marriage is Not Consummated</h3>
<p>Although Yang Naimei married Chen Xunmin, the son of Chen Shaobai, a veteran of the Kuomintang, few outsiders know about it. Because their ceremony was very simple: (1) no formal dress, no ceremony, no photos; (2) no male elder officiating, no visiting friends. The procedure was that Chen and Yang both signed a document at a lawyer's office, prepared some wine and dishes at home, and Naimei's mother and others gathered together for a meal, which was considered a ceremony. However, Chen's parents disagreed, so Chen and Yang's marriage cannot be called a completely successful union.</p>
<h3>New World Sisters Watching a Play</h3>
<p>Star Film's Hu Die and Tianyi Film's Hu Shan, who are cousins, went to the New World yesterday because they were bored to watch the "Drama Association" live play. Li Lilian and Li Hua of the "Drama Association" are Hu Shan's former colleagues, and Tang Huaiqiu is Hu Die's colleague, so they specially invited them to visit the backstage. However, others are not qualified to go backstage.</p>
<p>Film Treatise</p>
<h3>Chinese People and Chinese Films by Chen Dabei</h3>
<p>During the warlord era in Beijing, I often heard friends in political, academic, and business circles who were full of foreign airs saying that Chinese films were pitifully naive and not worth watching. In Nanjing, under the clear blue sky and white sun, the situation was still similar. Most of the films shown in first-class cinemas were foreign films. Those who advocated domestic films were mostly poor students. People who were higher up in society still dismissed domestic films with a single stroke, even asserting that the Chinese film industry was forever hopeless. That kind of complacent bystander attitude often made me question their nationality, because, in today's world, no one in any country is so generous and magnanimous.</p>
<p>Indeed, Chinese films are not as good as foreign films, but what is the reason for this? Is it because the photography and lighting equipment is not sophisticated? Of course, this is a fact. It is embarrassing that since the beginning of the film industry, Chinese people have never manufactured their own cameras, not even a foot of film. To be honest, all the machinery for film production, even the parts, are imported from abroad. If the poor quality of the equipment is the reason why domestic films are not as good as foreign films, then we can only blame ourselves for not being ambitious enough, being plagued by wars year after year, leaving the people poor and the country exhausted, and all industries depressed, affecting the film industry. Where would there be tens of thousands of dollars to buy the latest foreign-invented cameras and lighting equipment?</p>
<p>However, the poor quality of the equipment is not the fatal flaw of domestic films, because the equipment can be bought with money, and unlike military equipment, there are no secret and unspoken clever uses that buyers are not allowed to learn. As long as our film companies have sufficient capital, we can enjoy the benefits of any newly invented photographic machinery, and we can even hire foreign cinematographers.</p>
<p>Then, is it that there is a lack of screenwriting talent, or that the talent of directors and actors is not as good as that of foreigners? This may be true. Everyone knows that the most developed film industry in the world today is the United States. The American film industry has a history of more than forty years, while China's has at most only ten years. How can a ten-year-old student with congenital deficiencies compete in strength with a strong man with iron fists? It is already a mistake to compete. If the competition fails, and the relatives and friends of this weak student sit in the audience and shout for him to fall, I ask, do these relatives and friends still have a heart! Alas!</p>
