<p>時評</p>
<h3>膠東戰事之前途　都良</h3>
<p>自膠東事變突發以來。社會人士。靡不奔走駭汗。動色相告。謂外患方殷。内戰又作。孰非黄軒齊胃寗無存卹之念於是而籲請息爭之函電紛披乎報　祈求和平之使者。接迹於道塗矣。中央以威信所繫。未容漠視亦復一再嚴令制止。著復原防。韓劉於奉令之下。均曾表示服從靜候處理。似雙方猶有悔禍之心。而已發之釁端。不難復歸於弭平。顧三五日來事實所襮示於吾人者則如何韓復榘雖返濟南。而掖縣之圍未撤也。劉珍年表示不抵抗。而逆襲邀擊之舉頻傳也。寖假而韓軍騎兵入黄縣矣。抵福山矣。佔登州矣。劉珍年放棄棲霞矣。不守牟平矣。從可證雙方所稱爲停戰者。祇爲一種紙上之宣傳。而實際膠東猛烈之砲火。固未嘗一日間歇也。</p>
<p>韓復榘以省主席之尊。奄有師旅之衆。過去戰績。吾人猶能憶及劉雖悍强。特一隅之雄。望實並遜。無可衡比。韓果蓄意翦除之者。則在重兵壓迫之下。解决之道。正復非難。徒以各方廢戰之殷切。勢不能不與相酬答。其不爲急遽之措署者。正欲避戎首之惡名耳。劉固自審非敵。而又無解甲下野之意志。乃以縮小防地之策略。爲集中負嵎之部署。更復利用自身弱點。冀得中央援助。其駐京代表一再聲稱退　。即在博取中央之同情。意若曰我固已遵中央命令撤退矣。韓軍步步進逼。中央其奈之何。韓亦未嘗不知此著之失。故其致蔣委員長之電文。一則曰復榘應膠東人民之請命。實出萬不得已。再則曰但使地方有裨。身受犧牲。亦所甘願。匣劍帷燈。意在言外。蓋一則諉賣於中央。一則尸咎於民衆。要其縈念地盤不肯罷休之心理。則固出一轍而無二致也。在此兩軍僵持之局面中。中央果取若何之態度乎。就現狀論。韓軍已占勝著。中央將遂聽其呑噬而不復干涉乎。抑將毅然執行命令加壓力於不服制止之一方乎。準諸中央已往之政策。似未能有當機立斷之决心。矧當國難重疊之秋。内戰不特爲理論所非難。亦且爲事實所不許。中央一旦因維持威信而用兵。理論上固可不儕於普通内戰之列。而事實上卻亦難於發端。在此拘執情勢之下。中央亦儘得託委曲國全之口號。爲更求其次之處置。用兵一事。吾知免矣。</p>
<p>武力制止。旣有未便。拱視不顧。又失威望。則中央所以處置膠東事變者。亦唯有於不損害韓劉兩方根本利益原則之下。以求達其調解之目的耳。蔣委員長之派員監視停戰。蔣伯誠之建議劉部他調。皆此調解途徑之見端。而胥有實現之可能者。蓋劉部一他調。而三方之意均愜。在劉能獲得另一之地盤。在韓得貫澈去劉之目的。在中央可保持埀隳之威信。自非情勢别有激變。吾人揣測。庶其近是。彼呼籲和平者。其亦以此爲滿足也歟。</p>

<p>「吃饝饝要請示長官、那麽拉尿也護照了、」一個站在第三者的兵士很滑稽地捕入談話、於是大家噗嗤一聲辛苦步行的兵士們就隨地坐下、拿着各人所有的　糧像風捲殘雲的吃了、</p>
<p>我雖在一個牛糞猶在的牛棚中　上面蓋着枯殘的樹枝、四面還有那永遠爲人們討厭的蒼蠅似乎精神非常充足的上下飛繞、但彼此悠然自樂、很自然地絕對不能再顧慮着衛生地、拿着肉包子大吃、十二時半大家的肚了、已是裝滿了水和食糧、重復打起精神的前進、那時我們騎馬者、」鞭旣加便風入四蹄、如電掣的一般奔馳目之所及、惟見靑山與白雲、向後迅速地退去、在下午四時前、就到了我們預算住宿所在地的汔台街、</p>
<p>圪台街是一個很小的鎭、只有店舖三四家、因爲　幾次遭着土匪的蹂躪、從破爛的房屋中、處處可以看出肅條的景象來、這是一個在土匪環繞中的區域我們初至之時、眞相不明、精神上十分快樂、在石塊高低不齊的街中散步、隨時在門牆上可以看見民衆的文學「夜夢不祥寫在西西牆太陽一照、化爲吉祥」和「夜店舖門向西開東風吹得客商來、南風吹得生意滿北風刮得大發財、」等字句、到處皆是而我們所往驄馬與人們相對一室的店門上、還寫着「李白借問誰家高、劉伶管曰此地好」的標語、語氣還是異常的炫耀哩、</p>
<p>風悲日暮昏黑的晚色漸漸來了、　警的聲浪也漸漸傳入我們的耳鼓了、大家不期而然的有些提心吊膽了、　時、兵上們已上了槍剌、在要隘嚴密地守衛着、八時便宣布臨時戒嚴、雖自已人出外、也須口令、沈寂的夜光中、空氣登時緊張起來、晚餐的時候、張默夫向大家報告道「這裏的東南山口、有小股土匪盤踞、今夜務請各位小心、但一有槍聲　諸位也不必恐慌、仍請高枕而臥、雙足不必出户、因爲我們預算我們的武裝同志所有的力量、已是足夠對付他們了、」</p>
<p>以形勢言、圪台街鎭所處的地位眞是塡盡壞絕、四面都是高山、而鎭却在衆山之低處、假使有少數土匪在黑夜中、在山頂上踞高臨下、向着我們放槍、我們一如釜中游魚、只好束手待斃、幸虧劉連長　度有方、先令熟悉地勢的民團在高處警備兵士則在山中險要地帶嚴守、街中放步哨之兵徹夜往來不絕、溶溶的月光、照着心驚膽戰的死街上、更增加了人們不少的恐怖、「你歡喜那月光嗎、」我問着一個站在門首的兵士、他們是荷着上剌的槍、爲我們而終夜辛勞的、「不、不、我不歡喜那月光、因爲在這月光之下、我們是土匪的最好目標呀、」他本着軍事智識而答復、咳、同是月光、也許有人在上海麗娃栗坦之村、和伴侶贊美着她的皎潔、她的美麗、千家動動凉夜之思、萬里徧明輝之布、而在這裡則令人悄焉寡權、不能得到人們的歡迎、憂樂的對象、可見本是没有一定的標準、最後那兵士告訴我當晚的普通口令是富强二字、特别口令是改良農村四字、我因無事外出所以雖然知了而未用、我在九十時臨睡的時候預在屋後找覓了幾處可以避免槍彈的土壘以爲不測的準備、還有多人和衣而睡、拿鞋子放在枕旁、免得臨時手忙脚亂、</p>
<p>像這樣風聲鶴　草木皆匪的過了一夜、好容易挨到八日的天明、（未完）</p>

<p>無法脫險　船身擱淺後、初時船主等尚擾打倒車駛出、無如船内所裝之煤、均是重貨、又從深陷沙難、一再倒駛、而絕不能移動分毫、轉使船體發生危險、至是船主楊洪麟、亦知一時不易曳出、遂放小舢板登陸、至鎭江乘火車來滬、向總局報告、並議施救方法、</p>
<p>派船救護　昨日楊船主到滬、將失事情形報告劉石蓀、並議定由滬派强力之拖輪、到鎭江往曳、議定卽請會德豐特放大號拖輪、並帶工人一批、於昨午經船主楊洪麟率同開往金山寺對岸拖救、能否卽時拖出、尙未可知但、據報告、船身前部已深陷沙泥内、情勢頗爲險惡、損壞與否、須曳出後再騐、</p>

<h3>南京路寶成銀樓大火</h3>
<p>火燒有六小時之久</p>
<p>交通斷絕形勢嚴重</p>
<p>永安先施暂停營業</p>
<p>損失聞約一百萬元</p>
<p>昨日下午二時三十分、南京路第五百十號寶成裕記銀樓忽肇焚如、茲將起火前後情形、分誌於下、</p>
<p>南京路上之巨肆　寳成裕記銀樓、已開設多年、係甬商所創辦、其經理亦係甬人、姓費該樓爲滬上銀樓業中大同行之一、亦爲南京路上之巨肆、自建三層洋房、外嵌白磁磚、屋頂築有亭子兩隻、門面裝飾、異常富麗、其左接壤香粉衖、右爲浙江路、樓下爲門市交易、二樓三樓爲作塲及寄宿舍所在、以交通之便利及地位之得宜、故平日營業、十分擁擠　　二層樓突然起火　詎在昨午二時三十分左右、該樓二層樓上中間、突然起火、頓時延燒、一時黑烟瀰漫、火光熊熊、南京路日昇樓一帶商店、頓起恐慌、亟各將排門緊閉、同時捕房方面及中央救火會亦得訊、急驅救火車到塲灌救、無奈東北風正盛、火藉風威、愈燒愈烈、中央救火會乃轉知各處救火會、全體驅車到塲協助、計到十餘輛、列如長蛇、但火勢仍未稍殺、</p>
<p>左右鄰同被蔓延　至三時十五分左右、該樓二層樓、已全部燒去、延及三層樓、同時東鄰長豐水菓行、西鄰老大昌糖菓號樓上亦被延燒、各救火員見勢成燎原、乃在毘連該銀樓四週商號屋頂上射水、阻其蔓延、至五時五十分、長豐水菓行與老大昌樓面及寶成二層樓、火勢先被救熄、因此樓下各門市部、均得保存無恙、</p>
<p>火燒六小時之久　但斯時火勢仍在向上直竄、三樓上已全部着火、救火員乃架升雲梯、由屋頂向下灌救、然此熄彼起、終至不可收拾、所幸該樓房屋較旁屋爲高、故得免蔓延、直至七時、三樓已全部燒毁、經救火員奮勇灌救、火始熄滅、但黑烟仍繚繞不散、至七時二十分左右、灰燼復燃、因此屋頂上所築凉亭、又起焚燒、因無關重要、故一任燒去、至七時五十五分、凉亭被毁倒坍、救火員乃重行澈底灌射、至八時半火勢全部撲滅、各處救火車始先後開去、留中央救火車在塲繼續灌射、至今晨始返、</p>
<p>南京路形勢嚴重　當火起時</p>
<h3>寶成銀樓大火情形（啓昌照相館攝）</h3>
<p>、羣衆聚而觀者、途爲之塞、尙有大半行人、藉一樂天茶園作隔岸觀火之舉、不約而往者數百人、及中央捕房探捕趕到、恐該園載重過量、肇成禍端、乃上樓將一班觀者勸散、同時將浙江路福建路貴州路南京路間交通暫時斷絕、所有一·二·七·路電車、均未通行、直待五時後、經電車公司派員到塲疏通、乃始放行、但仍不准在出事處停靠、三·五·六·路電車照常通行、惟行人仍被阻止、各路公共汽車均繞道九江路、至七時始恢復、各探捕尙在塲彈壓、永安·先施·中華商店等、均曾停止營業數小時、</p>
<p>損失在百萬左右　據事後調查、寳成銀樓除門市部得保存外、其他均付之一炬、損失當在百餘萬元、曾向怡和·泰和·保定·三公司保有生財險、共八萬一千兩、老大昌亦保有火險數萬兩、惟長豐行未曾保險、鄰近美文印刷局及三陽南貨同春祥洋布號、雖未遭災、然均被水漬、損失亦頗不貲云、</p>

<p>最初販賣水菓　死者名唐餘足（混名唐小碗子）、年三十六歲、江北阜寗人、幼失怙恃、家道淸貧、年二十、隻身來滬謀生、初在浦邊碼頭一帶、小販餬口、久之、稍具積蓄、乃改業水菓攤、二三年後、與航行外洋大來公司輪船諸水手相稔、乃小規模代販印度出產之馬蹄式烟土、自是營業日張、</p>
<p>合資開設土行　事後唐乃毅然抛棄别業、而專門經營烟土、未幾經人說合、娶同鄕胡氏女爲室、來滬同居於法租界辣斐德路安納金路口洋麵橋純德里　　　號　同時復與友人合資開設　餘記土行於法大馬路寳興用二十三號、</p>
<p>岳父種種刁難　唐平日嗜好頗深、每日下午四時方始離床、土行事宜、悉委他人管理、自與胡氏結褵後、育三女一男、伉儷甚篤、惟胡氏出自小家、現年三十一歲、父名胡績卿、爲一江北苦力小車夫、唐因愛屋及烏、乃將岳父薦至唐餘記土行監理一切、胡因出身微賤、而嘗擺其岳翁架子、致與土行固有職員、時常發生意見、</p>
<p>一子近罹刑網　加之胡有兩子均不肖、一名胡連慶、一名胡連康、連康現因盜刦未遂罪、在第二特區法院判處三年六個月之徒刑、鑒於以上種種原因、土行職員大多離去、於是土行乃無形閉歇、唐經此剌激、憤悔交集、責妻固屬不可、怒岳更不可能、至此唐之神經、遂失常態、</p>
<p>近忽時圖自殺　唐近來忽時自圖殺、家人亦愼防維謹、出入必差人跟隨、寸步不離、前日下午四時、唐自寓外出、臨行時、云須往新新屋頂花園游玩、家人乃命包車夫吳阿二隨之、兩人一路談來、已至南京路、步入新新公司、購得門票、直上花園六層樓、時游客擁擠異常、唐即直趨沿貴州路之欄桿旁、倚欄俯瞰、若有所思、</p>
<p>高樓一跳畢命　當時車夫吳阿二緊貼唐之身旁、覩唐異狀、更加注意、約一刻鐘後、唐忽命吳喚一茶房來泡茶、吳乃轉身、尙未數步、唐竟聳身越欄而過、吳亟轉身搶住唐之左腕、正欲喊救、唐突用足向欄上猛蹬、致吳無力握住、於是一霎時唐已腦漿迸裂、墮斃於貴州路中矣、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>二一枝譚</p>
<h3>吳儂口中的否决字</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>蘇州人口中諭及一個不滿意的人物而加以否决、說得文雅一些、當然說不佳；說得粗俗一些、當然說不好。但是，不佳和不好，都非蘇州土白：若照吳儂軟語，另有種種的否决字。</p>
<p>假如提出一個不受蘇州人歡迎的人物，故意詢問大衆道：</p>
<p>某人好麽？</p>
<p>於是！蘇州人的對語、自有種種的否决口氣：</p>
<p>（一）某人弗靈。</p>
<p>（二）某人弗軸。</p>
<p>（三）某人弗入味。</p>
<p>（四）某人弗入調。</p>
<p>四種否决口氣，都是表明着某人不佳或不好；而且，都是蘇州人口中很尋常很普徧的話；可以說弗靈的，也可以說弗軸；可以說弗入味的，也可以說弗入調。試把各種否决口氣、研究它的來源；說弗靈的，是巫醫社會中的否决語；說弗軸的、是機織社會中的否决語：說弗入味的，是廚娘社會中的否决語；說弗入調的，是樂工社會中的否决語。在先，這四般說法、都是每　種社會中的術語，後來說得普徧了、變成人人口中都可以這般說、以表明某種人物的不佳或不好。</p>
<p>但是，吳儂說到滿意的人物、常常單獨說一個「靈」字、或者，單獨說一個「軸」字、而不常常單獨說「入味」或「入調」，這是其中不同之點。　　而且，弗靈和弗軸，是對於種種人物都可說的；弗入味和弗入調，只適用於批評不良少年。</p>
<p>要是老年人犯了不良少年的毛病，這兩種否决字樣上面、還得加上一個老字；最近，吳中六旬以上的某老畫師，犯了强奸幼女的罪而解往法院，他所經過的地方，常有吳儂這般的指斥他：</p>

<h3>射日臺記</h3>
<p>— 許耜秋</p>
<p>丨爲對日而作丨</p>
<p>嘗讀淮南子，后羿射日，要傳唐堯之世，十日並出，草木枯焦。時有窮國王日后羿者、精於谢，堯命射之，中九而留一，此即「射日」之所由來也。</p>
<p>今者、暴日禍我，變本加厲，較曩古十日並出爲尤甚。東北之數萬方里，被其蹂躪殆遍；兹春淞滬之血未乾，最近熱邊之驚又傳；雖有馬占山，丁超，李杜，及各路義勇軍等之抵抗、然彼毒燄凶張，迄未稍殺。恨無后羿再世、掃射彼暴日之淫威，以雪我亘古未有之奇恥！</p>
<p>我友陳子平，愛國之志士也。家富，性慷慨，屢蠲鉅金作殺敵用。邇復就其家園中，築　臺曰「射日」臺形四方，高可尋丈，中有頂，圓如球，堊以鮮紅色，髣髴日形也。而以一箭貫其腹。陳子每晨起，携弓帶箭至園中，距臺數十武，發箭射之，以示不與暴日共戴天，此臺之所以額「射日」之名也。陳子曰：箭雖古之武器，不適於今，然一旦效命沙塲，短兵相接時，先發制人，亦未嘗不可使敵受重剏，此又一射日之計也。</p>
<p>我於隔昨應陳子之邀而往觀焉，園中金風習習，木葉就衰，聲聲秋蟲，一若爲東北而哀鳴者，而彼臺頂日形，被風雨吹打，寒露滴瀝，腹生一箭之穿，累經陳子之射，楚歌四面，頓改舊觀，其不岌岌乎殆哉幾稀。嗚呼！願我朝野，一心一德，共赴大難，麾魯陽之戈，執后羿之箭，驅此暴日，而安天下，斯迺符陳子立射日臺之本旨也矣，故爲之記</p>
<h3>帽子的哲學</h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>有人說討老婆猶如買呢帽，放在店家櫥窗裏的帽子、無論平邊捲邊，無論灰色赭色、都覺得漂亮可愛；可是一買到手，戴平邊的却覺捲邊的好；戴灰色的總嫌不如赭色的好看，而戴在自已頭上的帽子，又覺得不如别人頭上的美觀；但當把别人的帽子奪過來自已戴的時候，立刻就會發見一些缺點，覺得還是自已的老帽子合適，</p>
<p>在選擇帽子的時候，千萬不要太性急，性急了會使你上當；也不要貪便宜，貪了便宜會使你懊喪。</p>
<p>買價錢賤的帽子，固然不能使你滿意；但價錢太貴的帽子，戴在頭上會使你提心弔膽丨大風時怕給風刮去，下雨時又捨不得濕壞了它，給老鼠咬壞了會使你肉痛，給賊骨頭偷了去儘夠你的悲哀；倒不如戴賤帽子，寫寫意意放一百二十個心；落雨天晴都不妨，連賊骨頭也不來覬覦。</p>
<p>帽子不要太老式，呌人家嘲笑；但也不要太時髦，呌人家看想。</p>
<p>買帽子寗可買寬一點；太緊了脫上脫下旣不易、戴上了會使你頭痛。</p>
<p>當帽子給人家「抛頂工」抛了去的時候，你千萬不要大聲喊捉賊，也不要去窮追；因爲事實上旣追不回來，徒然使旁人好笑，那又何苦？不過你得知道；你所以要被抛頂工的原因，不是帽子太漂亮，便是你太不當心，故意使帽子靠近了電車窗口之故。</p>
<p>討小老婆那是買草帽了；漂亮的草帽眞貴，比呢帽貴多了，可是只能在夏天出風頭；秋風　起，你便會想起被丢在牀頂上的舊呢帽；拿出來呌洗染公司好好的洗一下，又很寫意的戴在頭上；那時候你的草帽，怕已套在黄包車夫的頭上當雨帽，你連想也不喜想了。</p>
<p>這是帽子的人生哲學！</p>
<h3>小菜塲特寫</h3>
<p>— 錢台生</p>
<p>丨油，鹽，醬，醋，菜，米，柴，丨</p>
<p>喧鬧，紊亂，呌喊，爭論，那又潮濕，又腥氣，又骯髒，又嘈雜，這特殊的市塲裏，你能感到些什麽呢？　　從朦朧的早晨，太陽還幽黯地透出了地面，魚，肉，鷄，鴨，蔬菜，與葱蒜，都忙着展開，地面上灑開了水，一切交易在新開始。</p>
<p>來到這市塲中的人物，那來買大批食料，不是廚司便是飯頭，而且他們都是天天來，來得極早極早，和魚販肉舖相識，一切東西都比較便宜，因爲他，是他們天天的大主顧，便宜自然不容說；還有便是公館中的娘姨，伊們一樣是天天來，但比飯頭們便遲來一步，而且東西也貴得多，到九十點鐘，才有坐了包車的太太奶奶親自帶了十四兩秤到小菜塲來了；市塲中的小販用小秤，是當然的事，而坐包車來辦小菜的奶奶太太，旣然疑心娘姨們要落錢，又怕市塲裏的小秤，結果，太太自已帶了秤來、一樣也還是十四兩，</p>
<p>你不看見爲一個銅子的買賣、來回爭論了好幾次？你不看見買十個銅子的荳芽，秤了買主又抓了一把？小販固然刁滑，但也要性命，買主東西要便宜還要多，結果，忙了嘴唇皮，吵乾了饞吐水　　除了這些太太奶奶以外，便是那些蓬了頭髮赤着足，鈕扣都没扣好的姑娘，我們正難想像伊是怎樣倉皇趕到這裏來的；而且有許多正像出客似地把漂亮的衣裳帶到小菜塲來，也許伊們正忘記？那裏是一塊骯髒腥臭的地方吧。</p>
<p>這異味腥臭的市塲，附設了更多充飢的熟食，那麵餃與牛肉湯，都是早晨來辦食料人的好東西。</p>
<p>喧鬧移到中午，便漸漸地消散。在昏黯的黄昏夜晚的臨來，那便是流浪無家者再好没有的「臥塲」！</p>

<h3>入關郵侶</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>瀋陽城奸似是北平城一座縮小的雛型，具體而微，一樣是四四方方而四面有九座城門，只不過城圈周圍僅有北平城五分之一那麽大，倒小得怪精緻的呢！</p>
<p>因爲城的面積小·市面又歷來還發達，各種建設，斷難都擠擁在那座小小的城池裏，城外四關的面積便推廣得很大。東南西北四面，距離城門口的約莫四五里的地方，并因此都成爲工商業和住宅區域，統統呌做城關，與北平的外城相仿。又在那城關的界綫上，沿着九條城門的通衢，各建有一種關門，另呌做某某邊門或便門。</p>
<p>内城成是四方各有兩座城門；雖形式是一般的，名稱上却偏分别着大小。有大南門便還有小南門；東西二面也是一樣；只有北面在大小北門之間，另有一座關閉着的城門，是專爲湊滿九城的數目而設，可是并不開放　故所以邊門也就只有八座。并一樣分爲大東，小東，大西，小西，大南，小南，大北，小北，平平整整的在四方矗立着。</p>
<p>尤其是西方的一面，出了大西小西兩座邊門，再走二三里地，還有個被日本人所占據的南滿鐵路附屬地，周圍有二三十里那麽大，直通着南滿鐵路他們所始終固執地稱道着的「奉天」車站。因車站的關係而居然劃出那麽大的附屬地，又常常被人們統稱爲日本站或日本地；就中一切權力比其他各省的租界還大，簡稱想不承認爲租借地而自稱爲屬起地了！平日價藏垢納汚，無所不爲，拚命的圖他這附屬地的興盛，倒連帶着把瀋陽城外大西關小西關與大西邊門小西邊門這一路的地方，全凑合成很繁榮的樣子。但這繁榮不是能夠白拾的，等他們瞧着紅了眼睛，除了逐步蠶食以外，也還能一下子席捲一空而去。如今可不是都白扔了麽？而且所扔的還不只這兩座西關，乃是全東北的土地！</p>
<p>但推原禍始，未嘗不是這兩座大小西關被他們在侵略上小試其端；而九一八事變之夕，也是在這附屬地邊界發的難，並首先由大西小西兩城關的失陷，才由日軍唾手而得了整個的瀋陽城。一年來國恥未雪，失地未復，九一八却已做過周年紀念了！寫小說寫到這最可傷心的大西小西二關，感痛萬分，不由枉費許多血淚，直寫得恁般煩瑣；這不是别的，實是心曲中忘記不了這兩處地方啊！</p>

<h3>四種人</h3>
<p>— 祖娥</p>
<p>人的「人生觀，原無一定、一人有一人的「人生觀，各人有各人的「人生觀，」即一人之中、亦有早晚時價不同，孟子曰「血氣方剛戒之在鬭及其老也血氣旣衰戒之在得，」因是我靜靜的想，想起了四種人。</p>
<p>這四種人；一種是要錢不要命、一種是要命不要錢，再有一種是錢也要命也要、末了一種是命也不要錢也不要，試分析此四種人，倒也値得可憐可笑，可歎可慨，</p>
<p>第一種要錢不要命的　此種人可以綁匪，盜賊，守錢奴、非人生活的勞工者等歸類之，他們都對於自已的生命，視得極不鄭重，爲了金錢、誰都能所生命置之席外、像盜匪一類，簡實是預備了性命去擄刦，害財奴呢，你要他的錢，還是要他的命比較容易，一輩子只會和錢「拼命」罷了，其次非人生活的勞工者們、地位比較更可憐些、雖則也可說</p>
<p>，他們因爲了生命的求生存，才不得不這樣幹，但我終覺得還說他們要要錢不要命來得確切些，總之，這一類人，實是社會上一種可憐的人，</p>
<p>第二種要命不要錢的　此一類人比較少數，除眞眞廉潔自守，不貪財、惜生命者外、當推虔誠於宗敎中一類人，像佛敎中的視金錢爲身外物，基督敎之十誡勿妄取等、他們都僅修練自身，對於物質與金錢都淡漠得很，此一種人能表裏如一，澈底了解者，雖也未可多得，但他們的信仰條件，確是如此、此種中人對於社會未見有若何關係、只不過對於侈貪不倦者、給予一種慚愧的影響而已</p>
<p>第三種是命也要錢也要　這一種人，放開眼睛看，到也不少，上至大賈貴人，下至妓院裏的老舉等等，都是看得金錢像性命，性命又像金錢的互相鄭重着，眞是又要保重身體壽長，又要多撈錢財發財，資本家們出前入後保鏢，把自已的身體像一個正身的重犯一般禁衛着，這就是他們要命，控空心思在民間榨取錢財，這是他們要錢，即是目下有些貴人和要人，也脫不了此種行徑，其下焉者，就像妓院裏老舉，死要銅錢，身體不肯勞勞力，勞勞神，也是要命要錢，適巧一週年了被日兵蹂躪了的東三省的失地長官，也就爲了要撈錢要保住性命，才輕輕地斷送了國土，所以這一種命也要錢也要的人，實在是最不足齒，最是社會人羣之害，令人長歎息的人，</p>
<p>第四種是命也不要錢也不要　這種人自然少得很，本來，不顧性命，不愛金錢，能有幾人？現在，幸有差强人意的事，就是這種人在中國，倒也產生了不少，就是名見於社會的東北義勇軍，可算不要命不要錢的代表了，他們眞所謂「没命」的在和日本人拚命，金錢不能誘動他們的心，他們忘記了自家的家，自家的性命只知道爲民族奮鬭，爲國家救亡，此起彼落，出没襲擊，幾天不進食不算一回事，殺敵人最最要緊，一年來打得敵人走頭無路，一夕數驚，不要命不要錢，只有他們擔當得起，這第四種人，眞是夠人感慨欽敬了，</p>
<p>四種人冩完了，讀者們，請你在中國的國内，找找那一種人多些呢？</p>

<h3>馬來樹膠</h3>
<p>— 谷鵠</p>
<p>電線的内面，包在銅絲上的一層，類似橡皮的物質實在，這就是馬來樹膠，Gullapercha人的電流傳導性，比各種橡皮更小，眞可算是一個絕緣導體的物質，因此用以做種種的電氣上的機械，他還有特别的功効！就是不能和氟化水素相作用，故化學上又作爲藏氟化水素的瓶，現在市上新發明的自由皮，也是馬來樹膠的一種，</p>
<p>馬來樹膠的組成物，是炭素水素外，尙有酸素，其製法：是從馬來半島上的赤鐵　樹中，提取他的凝液，加熱煉之，然後放冷，則成爲固體，其純粹的是白色，不純粹的是褐式，若在加熱時，放子百分之三十以上的硫磺，則呈硬化，就呌硬性樹膠，浸於溫水中，或者加熱，就會軟如牛皮糖！就可任意塑造各種的物品，倘若在硬性樹膠加熱時，通入二氧化硫漂白之，則成爲有光彩潔白的堅硬的角質！也可做人造的牙齒了，或者放入五硫化珶，則成紅色的角質，磨擦使發極美麗的光彩，用以做僞的牛筋木櫛，</p>
<p>馬來樹膠，極似橡皮，故又呌馬來橡膠，我因爲他是從樹中提取的，就呌他馬來樹膠，</p>
<h3>改良社會討論會　吉宇</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>兒童讀物的改良問題</p>
<p>神仙鬼怪與鳥言獸語的不同之點</p>
<p>本附刊近因討論兒童讀物改良問題，引起慈民，舜池，史娜諸君之辦論。但其辦論的中心，則俱集中於「神仙鬼怪」與「鳥言獸語」的優劣一點。其實這兩點確有不同之處，史娜君知其不同，而不知其不同之點何在，所以本來不成問題的，也就成爲問題了，按「神仙妖怪」，與「鳥言獸語」不同之點，可解釋如下：</p>
<p>「神仙鬼怪」與「鳥言獸語，」雖同屬高</p>
<p>言，然因其寓言的主體不同，所以亦有「純假說」與「半假說」的不同。蓋一種事實的構成，不外乎三點：（一）主體，（二）行爲，（三）語言。倘此三項中有一項爲「現實」的，「自然」的，則其寓言即爲屬於「半假說」的。</p>
<p>神仙鬼怪，本來是虚無飄渺的東西，在一般人的觀念中，對於「神仙鬼怪，」往往含有神秘恐怖的成分。鳥獸本來是一種現實的動物，而爲人人所習見者。因此雖同爲寓言，而實際上却有「纯假說，」與「半假說」的不同。</p>
<p>再從利害上觀察，亦有不同之點。因前者屬於「神秘恐怖」之成分太覺濃厚，印入兒童之腦筋後，不易洗滌，且無從證明其眞僞，不啻爲「迷信」培植勢力，後者則其主體大都爲兒童所有見，鳥獸之行爲如何，能否言語，乃人人所知之事實，不待解釋，即可知其爲寓言。故兩者之間，即使其能鼓起兒童興趣之效力相同，而在敎本之採用，實有很大的差别。</p>
<p>至目前所採用之敎材，關於「鳥言獸語」一項的編述，可議之處，確不在少數。但此種缺點，大半原因，在於編輯者學問太淺薄，太顧到兒童興趣，一方面，而抛棄兒童人生應有的修養的緣故，不能目爲「鳥言獸語。」與「神仙妖怪，」僅有同等之價値也。</p>
<p>近來歐美兒童讀物，對於「鳥言獸語」，仍未放棄，但事實則已，漸漸傾向於現實生活化。其所取敎材，大都以社會爲中心，於極微細瑣碎之事實中，灌注兒童以公民的知識。即「鳥言獸語」寓言之目的，亦大都目的。換言之，其所記的行爲興語言，全係人類的自然現象，且爲常見者，在此種讀物中，不過將常見之鳥獸，替代其主體而已，所以此種作法，雖屬寓言，實際上則幾已衝破「實言之藩籬，而竭力趨向於自然化。</p>
<p>中國兒童讀物的缺乏，確屬不可掩的事實，倘欲加以改良，除却就這一條道路前進而外，再要找出别的途經來，似乎也很困難吧。（移酬捐助東北義軍）</p>

<h3>商業上的不二法門</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>昨天，老友洪子東來訪，洪君固商業中人，服務海上某大洋布號，該號生涯鼎盛，爲滬地洋布業中之巨擘，創立以來，獲利不貲，同業中有與其競爭者，輙遭失敗，即其貼鄰某號，資本亦雄厚，售價亦較低，然仍望塵莫及，難與較量，不知是何緣故，致有此良好結果，今趁洪君駕舍，一叩其底蘊，當蒙詳告，該號營業之特殊方法，因覺其言之足爲商人效法，故錄之，　　洪君云，該號經理某君，爲人敏捷，腦具巧思，手腕靈活，熟悉商意門徑，慣識顧客心理，當每一夥友進店時，彼必告以營業之方針，及應付顧客之種種手叚，並曰，際茲商戰時代，倘單憑（貨眞價値，童叟無欺，）的死板古法，來應付，和號召，定必難邀勝利，故祗有另闢蹊徑，採用新的科學化的方法，來應付之，勝利方可操劵也，其所云方法，約略述之如左，</p>
<p>（一）欲貨品求顧客之滿意，當用烘托法，即如來客欲購紅緞若干，則同時取一藍緞，備置紅緞旁邊，假意慫恿其購買藍緞，將紅藍兩貨，並列相眏，當然，紅緞被藍緞一烘托·錦上添花·其顏色更覺生動美觀·顧客見之，定然表示滿意，而生意立就，倘購藍緞，則用紅緞烘托，購黑綢，用白綢烘托，總之，認定烘托兩字下手，當無往而不利也。　　（二）迎合顧客心理，倘來客一聞價低，即曰太歹，此客必喜闊綽者，價低貨不配也，宜在貨房内，將稍高之貨，換上價貴之標簽，出而應之，客聞價貴至若干，必曰好好矣，（洪君又云，有一次，一客購一直貢呢，余以價値一元二角之貨應之，彼聞價低，貨尙不曾細辦，遽云太歹，適經理在旁，即向客曰，好的貨，有，有，在樓上，稍待，我去取，當將櫃上一元二角之貨，挾之進内，少頃，出外，向客曰，此貨好嗎，二元六角，客連喊好好，成交而去，余察之，所謂二元六角之貨，仍舊剛才一元二角之貨，暗嘆經理手叚之高妙矣，）倘客一聞貨價，即曰太好，其客必爲經濟者，當取一疋價頂貴者，置於價低貨旁，語以若彼貨者，價要若干若干也，現在此貨之價，誠便宜之甚矣，客見一疋，價高至若干，一疋祗有若干，相較之下，貴賤懸殊，必然自覺欲購之貨便宜，而立即成交矣。</p>
<p>（三）婦女顧客，施以小惠，婦女們，都喜佔小便宜，故將其所購之貨中間，揀物微而價輕者，予以特别之放頭，破格之削碼，總計數角之便宜，可在價貴貨上，稍繁一　　　　　　　　　　　貨之價，便宜若是，當喜之不勝，覺樣樣便宜矣，或在交易畢後，贈以手帕，或香皂等小物若干，彼必眉飛色舞，感之，謝之，下次之交易，打之不去，駡之不開矣，</p>
<p>（四）和顏悅色，此法亦重要也，我國商店中人，對待顧客，往往盛言厲色，面孔板得像鋼甲，做生意，像尋相駡，際此商業競爭潮流，若仍用如此態度，營業必大受打擊，該經理明白斯弊，故諄諄告誡各友，對待顧客，必須和顏悅色，態度殷勤，使顧客喜悅，而營業隨之發達，</p>
<p>尚有招待週到，及遇有顧客多付踐鈔，遺失物件，必須規規矩矩，如數奉璧，等信條，亦發展營業的不二法門也。</p>

<h3>失望</h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>在祇重衣衫不重人情的現代社會裏，我不幸而有一位銀行界聞人親戚，雖然，還有許多没有碰過橡皮釘子的朋友正在羨慕我窮人的親戚，三年前，我在中學畢業了，不知天高地遠的踏進社會，自以爲中學畢業生大可以展用，但是三年於茲，依然故我，雖没有餓死，但已没有人性，變成裝飯和造糞的機器而已，當然這時候想起了我的富親戚丨銀行界聞人，汽車，洋房…於是備了幾式禮物，請敝夫人屈駕一行，因爲我出言率直，恐得罪了富人，豈不自已打散飯碗，這已是滬戰前的事了，敝夫人回來很滿意的對我說「乂伯伯很歡迎我去，希望你（我）也常常到他家去談談，關於謀事，他說有機會就來喊你，臨走時，還喊我時常去，親戚不可疏遠…」我知道妻碰了橡皮釘子，但是她没有我三年的經騐，那裏知道他們的甜言蜜語完全像妓女的迷湯，收了你幾式禮物，也得給個空心湯團你回來，我當時也一笑置之，明知是瞎貓捉死老蟲的勾當，窮人總是窮人！</p>
<p>八九個月也吃飯造糞的過去了，而且得了許多學校裏没有敎我們的藝術，如拍馬，吹牛，欺詐，恐嚇等等隨時隨地隨人而應用，中秋節的前幾天，我們窮人正在運用手段想逃過這難關，不料乂伯伯的妻子乂伯母突然駕臨亭子間，我又驚又喜，富人也有殘羹冷飯照應到窮人身上，有一個什麽銀行，添加三個Clerk我已蒙乂伯伯說穩了，祗要你寫封Application去，就好上寫字間，我想這不是懇求富人的事，是富人賞賜我的，所以寫了自薦信後，和朋友談起時好像我已是銀行界的聞人，洋房，汽車的氣概，到中秋節，少不到又備了幾式禮物，御駕一番（時髦語），問候，誌謝後，想探探幾時可以進行，他說「一有回音，就來喊你」，我也乂伯伯…乂伯伯…的喊回來，</p>
<p>望望日曆，十幾天又過去了、前途毫無回音，妻又去一次，上門不見土地，聞銀行界人到南京公幹去的，當然，窮人總是窮人！富人不高興時睬也不着你！碰橡皮釘子還不幸中的大幸，稍施一點小惠，已使你受寵若驚，</p>
<p>失望之餘，我好像中秋節多負了十元窮債，</p>
<p>學堂寫眞</p>
<h3>上課</h3>
<p>— 劍超</p>
<p>課堂裏坐滿了人，除了三五個人在偶偶私語外，其餘都靜悄悄預備着功課。</p>
<p>「喂！怎樣Ｗ先生還不來。鐘聲好像響過了嗎？」Ｓ生似乎有點等得不耐煩了。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>「鐘已經敲過了好一會。但是Ｗ先生還不來。這眞有點出乎意外呀！我想。大約是他生了病。若不然的話。他爲什麽會不來呢？他從没有請假或遲到過呀！」Ｓ同坐在一張桌子的Ｅ附和着。　　「討厭；我眞不高興上他的課呢：眞豈有此理。老是把難題目給我做。好像專和我作對似的。English我今天一點也没有預備。不怕你們笑我每次上這一課就要覺得頭痛呢：眼睛雖對着書本子瞧。而心却早已跑到大光明去了。假如先生不來的話。那我眞要念佛號謝謝天呵。哼，這撈什子學來做什麽。我又不靠他吃飯。」Ｃ似得意而又惱恨似的也加入了這談論。「Ｚ我們到後操塲去散步散步吧：坐在這囚籠式的課堂裏眞要悶死人呵·」他俩跑出課堂一蹤一跳轉向後操場去。</p>
<p>「唉！Ｃ確是個聰明　的孩子。可惜太不肯用功而且也太神氣了。」一個嘆惜者的聲音。</p>
<p>「是吓！如果她肯把聰敏的頭腦用在學問上去。將來一定會成就一個很有作爲的人。這不是Ｗ先生說的嗎？Ｗ先生對Ｃ含有神秘的作用呢；」一個悄皮的嘲諷</p>
<p>「眞的嗎？你怎麽知道。Ｃ的意思怎樣呢？Ｗ先生誰都承認他是個才貌雙全的人物。哈，哈，那麽Ｃ還怕英文不及格嗎？啊！難怪他每次上課。對她都是特别注意而且敎法和我們不同。他總怕她不懂得。」</p>
<p>「怎樣不知道。我告訴你吧；Ｗ先生的堂妹和我的表妹同學。這話是她告訴我的。若問Ｃ是否也有意思。道祇有她自已知道。我們當然不曉得的。」</p>
<p>「一陣格格的皮鞋聲」由遠而近。於是把他們的談話打斷。</p>
<p>「先生來了。上課罷」，一　　雜聲。</p>
<p>一位穿着漂亮的西裝少年。笑容可掬的跑到講臺上去。同時由他口上吐出幾句漂亮的話。</p>
<p>「今天來遲了。這可算是第一次呢？」慢慢地揭着書。眼睛向四周一渺。似乎有所視察。</p>
<p>「怎麽樣。Ｃ今天没來嗎？」各人的目光因爲這句話齊集在先生臉上。　　「她早來。因等先生得不耐煩。和Ｚ跑到後操塲去打球了。」</p>
<p>「那麽你去呌她倆來吧」；</p>
<p>Ｗ先生若有所思。他不講話也不敎書。</p>
<p>「先生。今天敎那一篇快敎吧。要下課了呢；」</p>
<p>學生不耐煩的呌着。</p>
<p>「哦！今天嗎？敎Ｓecond　Book　ofobservation　Thought　and　Expression上的第十四課。就是Ｐassive　ConjugatiＯＮ………」口裏雖這樣應付着學生，而眼睛不時的向窗口外望。一陣急促的皮鞋聲。</p>
<p>「咭格咭格」地跑到敎室裏。</p>
<p>Ｗ先生不覺露出了一絲微笑。</p>
<p>「Ｃ怎麽上課也不知道。還要人去請。好大架子。」</p>
<p>「不是的。這祇好怪你自已不………」Ｃ把那雙富有吸引力的眸子向着先生臉上一瞟。這樣强辯着。但是，下面說些什麽話誰都聽不見。祇見Ｃ的嘴在嚅嚅動着。先生一點怒容也没有。仍是露着笑容可掬的翻開書本和平時一樣起勁了。</p>
<p>異想天開</p>
<h3>溫文儒雅的保姆</h3>
<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>銀兒在被窠裏不斷地痛哭，整個的心靈是紀念着母親！希望她快快的來臨，　有他爸爸以買洋囝囝一類的話來誘止。不但哭聲不停，反要在床裏亂跳亂撞做個起勁。胡先生爲了大人回香港，心底已感到十二分的枯燥，現在銀兒還在他面前哭鬧不休，於是胡先生更覺得無趣與苦悶。</p>
<p>當阿四從綠衣人手裏接到大批的信札，却大吃一驚，後纔曉得是胡少爺在報紙上招請保姆的缘故。</p>
<p>「承胡先生約談，不勝榮幸！」一個面貌和藹服裝素雅的年靑女子，點頭帶笑的說。</p>
<p>「勿要客氣！現在要累女士……」</p>
<p>「一個活潑潑的天眞爛漫可愛的寳寳，眞是福氣！現在幾歲了？」</p>
<p>「那裏那裏，今年剛是五歳。粱女士，你從前擔任過什麽工作？那裏唸書？」</p>
<p>「離開家鄕乂乂女子師範，來上海當乂乂小學校的音樂主任，並兼幼稚班級任；不幸霹靂一聲，滬戰爆發，學校大受影響，迄今卒未恢復，我便一直在家裏荒廢着。保姆一席很是樂就！請間待遇怎樣？」她的態度却非常誠懇。　　「梁女士熱心敎育事業，佩服佩服！講到此地待遇，薪水二十元，供膳宿，不過小兒脾氣不好！怪愛哭，尤其他母親回家後，幾乎哭得震天動地，不知女士可否耐性敎導？哈哈哈。」</p>
<p>「我雖不敢說對令公子能盡怎樣愛護之責，但以我過去的經騐。只要體透了小孩的個性，諒不難令胡先生得到相當的滿意。」</p>
<p>從此胡先生仍可到校敎育，精神亦日見興奮，銀兒對保姆也似乎有緣分，性情也很溫和了些，功課完畢常同保姆出外游玩；因此，他一切都很放心，可是今天情形不同，胡先生躺在沙發裏啣着紙烟向天花板出神，笑意没有，臉色憔瘁，銀兒同梁女士怎樣一夜的不歸？正在思念的一刹，突然接到了一封要拿兩千五百元贖回銀兒的來信，胡先生駭得幾乎立刻便成神經病，不禁念念大呼；</p>
<p>「這樣一位溫文儒雅的保姆，怎樣會是變相的綁票匪呀？唉！這樣的社會那還了得嗎？」</p>
<p>家道問題</p>
<h3>一個勢利的家庭</h3>
<p>— 亢石</p>
<p>黄媽的年紀五十多歲了，是一個天字第一號的舊人物，她的丈夫已經死了四年，幸而有三個兒子，和幾萬塊錢存着，多麽的快樂，享她晚年的福。</p>
<p>大兒子和二兒子，已經都娶了親，二媳婦的娘家有錢，大媳婦的娘家却没有錢。在那舊腦筋的黄媽，當然；存着偏心，把二媳婦非常竉愛，大媳婦却一些看不起，這也是勢利心的驅使吧！　　黄媽因爲竉愛二媳婦，所以把一切粗重的事，都交給大媳婦做，那大媳到也非常賢淑，耐勞，可是；不平等的待遇，日子久了，也會發生變化！那大媳婦看見二媳婦優游閒散，反顧自已，却早晨煩到晚間，所以有時在暗下怨憤，由怨憤而抗爭，這也是人之常情啊！</p>
<p>記得有一次，大媳婦和二媳婦發生口角，那竉愛慣的二媳婦，哭訴給黄媽聽，黄媽就向大媳婦駡道；</p>
<p>「嘿！你隻窮乂，天生的窮骨頭，賤骨頭，你看看二媳婦的嫁妝，都是紅木的還有珠玉首飾，你呢！只有幾件蹩脚東西，一個錢都不値，還要爭長論短，你的火氣倒也不小，你要享福，不要出世在窮的爺娘家………」</p>
<p>這幾句話；駡得大媳婦啞口無言，心坎中好象被亂箭攢着，怎樣的沉痛！只好自怨自泣，過她壓迫的生活。</p>
<p>亭子間裏</p>
<h3>來層的誘脅</h3>
<p>— 奚鳥</p>
<p>獨身者的悲哀</p>
<p>蕭颯的西風，已經用了種秋的力驅走了溽暑的夏天。我最愛看那在秋天固有的像幾片淸紗樣的白雲，密切地貼近那高高的碧空的美景。所以時常閒着立在靜的Ｂ路上，仰望澹澹的秋雲………　　「羅靑兄，久違了，你好？………」</p>
<p>一陣好久没有聽到的聲音，驀地傳了來。眞使我出乎意外的喜歡，像開了心底花朶般地忙答道；五如兄，你好？我們的重逢，眞是天假之緣。你現在住在那裏？</p>
<p>「别的都好，只是我現在住的所在，常常給予我一種夾層的誘脅，這才是種苦惱呢」。同學們都賜給他「血頭朋友」雅號的周五如，忽然感到什麽夾層的誘惑之苦惱，眞使我詫異而像丈二和尙的摸不着頭腦和好笑。</p>
<p>健談的他，似乎被我詫異的神情鼓動了他本能的薄嘴唇。邀他到我家裏去坐一回倒說是不必，那夾層的誘脅之來由，却乖乖的滔滔地說道；</p>
<p>「我現在住的是一間小小的所謂後樓。很近的鄰居；前樓住着的，是一對中年夫妻，這一對夫妻的身材之不相稱，活像銀幕上的勞萊和哈台那麽滑稽有趣，男的瘦小得像隻麻雀，女的却肥胖得像隻猪　。夫妻倆的感情委直太好了，幾乎恨不得有老天永不天明之概。呵！羅靑兄！你没有嘗到我的滋味呢，我時常被他們强烈的振動聲，混雜的掙扎呻吟聲，以及嘻笑的淫泿聲，含糊的囈語聲………從淸甜的夢裏驚醒回來，使我薄弱的心靈受到一種不可言狀的狂跳，熱血受到一種不可言狀的沸騰。唉！種種的脅迫，使得和他們祗有一層之夾的獨身者我，感覺着窘迫和難堪，并使我蒙受不少的惡影響和惡幻想…」</p>
<p>他一口氣叙述着。我由不得發出種不知何味的笑影來，忙對他說道：</p>
<p>「這是個重要問題呢，你不要再因循住下去了，否則你的健康，也許會受打擊的呵！」</p>
<p>「但是一時找不到適當的住所，也没法避免，現在我常把「靑年之攝生」等有益於身心的書籍安置在手旁，用來抵抗這不安寗的攪擾和極汚穢的環境…」</p>
<p>「書文的抵抗力，總及不到粗暴的實力來得强大，我勸你還是離開這野塲，不要把靈魂攪昏了你的安全。」我似乎用長者的語氣有些像命令般的指導他。</p>
<p>「話是確然。幸喜我還相信我自已，不會亂動半些。」</p>
<p>「但願如此。」</p>
<p>他好像有要緊事，怱怱地同我約了明天準再會見的口約就向西去了。</p>
<p>大地被黑幕罩住了，我油然想起了夜世界的一切。這在都市化上海的周圍裏，種種挑撥性的發達，甚至夾層誘脅的利害呵！你也許戕賊而毒殺了幾多的靑年了。</p>

        <h1>1932.10.01</h1>
<h3>The Future of the Jiaodong War - Du Liang</h3>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the Jiaodong Incident, members of society have been running around in alarm, telling each other with changed expressions. They say that with foreign troubles pressing, internal warfare has broken out again. Who can be without thoughts of lamentation and anxiety? Thus, letters and telegrams pleading for an end to the fighting have flooded the newspapers, and envoys seeking peace have followed each other on the roads. The central government, concerned about its authority, could not ignore the situation and repeatedly issued strict orders to stop the fighting and restore the original defenses. Both Han and Liu, upon receiving the orders, expressed their obedience and willingness to await instructions, seemingly indicating that both sides still had a sense of regret and that the initiated conflict could be easily resolved. However, what the facts of the past few days have shown us is that, although Han Fuqu has returned to Jinan, the siege of Yexian has not been lifted. Although Liu Zhennian has expressed a desire not to resist, there have been frequent reports of ambushes and counterattacks. Gradually, Han's army cavalry entered Huangxian, reached Fushan, and occupied Dengzhou. Liu Zhennian abandoned Qixia and did not defend Muping. This proves that what both sides have claimed as a ceasefire is merely a form of propaganda on paper, while the fierce artillery fire in Jiaodong has not ceased for a single day.</p>
<p>Han Fuqu, with the prestige of being the chairman of the province and commanding a large army, with past military achievements that we can still recall, while Liu, although fierce and strong, is merely a local strongman whose prestige and strength are far inferior and incomparable. If Han had intended to eliminate him, then under the pressure of heavy troops, a solution would have been easy. However, because of the eagerness of all parties to abandon war, he could not help but respond. The reason he did not take hasty measures was to avoid the infamous reputation of initiating war. Liu, of course, knew that he was not a match, but he had no intention of giving up his arms and retiring to private life. Therefore, he adopted the strategy of shrinking his defense perimeter to concentrate his forces for a final stand. He also took advantage of his weakness, hoping to obtain assistance from the central government. His representative in Beijing repeatedly claimed to be retreating, in order to gain the sympathy of the central government, as if to say: "I have already complied with the central government's order to retreat. But Han's army is advancing step by step. What can the central government do?" Han was not unaware of the implications of this move. Therefore, in his telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, he stated, on the one hand, that Fuqu was acting on the request of the people of Jiaodong and was truly compelled by circumstances, and on the other hand, that he was willing to sacrifice himself if it would benefit the local area. The implications are self-evident. On the one hand, he was shifting the responsibility to the central government, and on the other hand, he was blaming the people. However, his underlying desire to cling to his territory and unwillingness to give up is the same. In this stalemate between the two armies, what attitude will the central government take? Judging from the current situation, Han's army has already gained the upper hand. Will the central government simply allow him to devour Liu without intervening? Or will it resolutely enforce its orders and exert pressure on the party that refuses to comply with the restrictions? Based on the central government's past policies, it seems unlikely that it will have the decisiveness to act immediately. Moreover, in this time of multiple national crises, internal warfare is not only theoretically unacceptable but also practically impossible. If the central government were to use force to maintain its authority, it could theoretically be argued that it is not the same as ordinary internal warfare. However, in reality, it would be difficult to initiate such action. Under these constrained circumstances, the central government can only resort to the slogan of "sacrificing local interests for the sake of the nation" and seek a secondary solution. I believe that the use of force will be avoided.</p>
<p>Since it is inconvenient to use military force to stop the conflict and turning a blind eye would damage its prestige, the central government's only option in dealing with the Jiaodong Incident is to seek to achieve its mediation goals without harming the fundamental interests of either Han or Liu. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's dispatch of personnel to monitor the ceasefire and Jiang Bocheng's suggestion to transfer Liu's troops elsewhere are both manifestations of this mediation approach, and both have the possibility of being realized. This is because the transfer of Liu's troops to another location would satisfy all three parties. Liu would be able to obtain another territory, Han would achieve his goal of removing Liu, and the central government would be able to maintain its declining prestige. Unless there is a drastic change in the situation, we believe that this is close to the truth. Those who are calling for peace, would they be satisfied with this outcome?</p>
<p>Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Su Bingwen and Zhang Dianjiu's Troops Completely Occupy the West Bank of the Nen River</h3>
<p>Su's vanguard reaches Fulaerji, approaching Heihe</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan personally goes to the front to supervise the troops, planning to join forces with the Su army</p>
<p>Su and Zhang say that the National Salvation Army's Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander can send out telegrams immediately</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the Japanese army invaded Heilongjiang Province, Su Bingwen has repeatedly planned to launch an attack. After Zhang Dianjiu's brigade, stationed in Lantun, launched an attack, Su sent a secret envoy to the Kedong area to meet with Ma Zhanshan, deciding to take unified action to encircle the Japanese army and first recover the provincial capital. Su's representative, disguised, detoured back to Manchuria, and Su actively expanded his military preparations. In just a few days, more than 10,000 people from various places joined, and Su expanded to two brigades, joining forces with Zhang Dianjiu's troops, totaling more than 50,000 people. Xie Ke, chief of staff of the Heilongjiang Provincial Governor's Office, and Jin Kuibi, director of the staff office, also detoured to Manchuria and assumed duties in Su's headquarters. The organization is as follows: Su Bingwen, commander-in-chief of the National Salvation Army; Zhang Dianjiu, deputy commander; Xie Ke, chief of staff; and Jin Kuibi, deputy chief of staff. Su's various brigades are stationed along the Chinese Eastern Railway line from Boketu to Manchuria. Zhang's brigade is stationed in Lantun and has completely disarmed the fake national border police surveillance team set up by the puppet state in Manchuria. It has declared to the local consulate that it is responsible for maintaining security in the area. The overseas Chinese of all countries are safe, and the Japanese consulate has also sent troops to protect them. The Su army quickly mobilized and occupied Hulunber Boketu on the Lu line on the 27th night. On the 29th, Su's vanguard reached Fulaer, only 40 li away from the capital city of Heilongjiang Province. The west bank of the Nen River is completely occupied by the Su and Zhang armies. The Su army will launch an attack on the provincial capital within days and will come into contact with the Japanese army near the provincial capital. The Japanese army in Heihe is the Changgu Brigade of the Duomen Division, with a total strength of about 3,000 people. Since the 27th, telegrams sent from Manchuria to various places have been interrupted. Ma Zhanshan's troops received a report of the Su army's mobilization, and Ma has personally gone to the front to supervise the troops, planning to join forces with the Su army in the provincial capital within a short period. The Reuters telegram that the Manchuria incident occurred due to the deduction of military pay for two months is completely Japanese propaganda and is not factual. The telegrams from Su and Zhang will be issued within days. (30th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Zheng Guilin's Troops Have Strong Strength</h3>
<p>(Beiping) An officer of the righteous army said that Zheng Guilin's troops have strong strength in Xing and Sui counties. In order to eliminate the righteous army, the Japanese side forced the establishment of people's groups in each village, with three to five groups forming an association, which was under the jurisdiction of the Japanese. The Japanese side gave each village 50 large guns, fearing that they would revolt. Each gun was charged 50 yuan, and the village head or his family members were forced to mortgage it. When Zheng's troops came into contact with the Japanese, the people's groups launched attacks from the rear. Zheng led the entire army to suppress them, and finally eliminated nine associations of people's groups, with more than 2,000 guns and a large amount of ammunition seized. The Japanese side stationed many troops in various stations and cities in Xing and Sui, and they were transferred back and forth every day. The security in Suizhong City was extremely strict. Forts and shelters were built on the city walls, and of the original four gates, only the south gate was open for people to pass through. Water was placed outside the city, and those entering the city had to wash their faces to prevent disguises. About 300 to 400 troops were stationed in the city.

<h3>Kidnapping of British Nationals in Newchwang</h3>
<p>Newchwang The kidnapping of Mrs. Bowle and Mr. Corkran in Newchwang has lasted for twenty-three days, and negotiations for their release have made little progress. The recent demands received yesterday from the bandit leader are simply unreasonable, proving that negotiations have not yet reached a promising stage of compromise. However, it is not yet hopeless. The messenger who returned yesterday was delayed by rain, but now that the autumn weather is clear, negotiations for their release should proceed quickly. According to the messenger from the Shi, the bandits' defenses are extremely strict.

<h3>Tao Sijin Case Difficult to Secure Leniency</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chief Clerk Chen of the Supreme Court spoke about the Tao Sijin case, saying that the law clearly states that murderers must die, and showing excessive leniency would be tantamount to encouraging immorality. The world is interested in discussing the abnormal phenomenon of homosexual love. Society is creating vivid stories, and newspapers are heavily reporting on it. Personally, I do not think this is right. If judged according to the law, this case must be classified as a death penalty. The Procuratorate has not yet sent this case to our court, but it should arrive soon. The Tao family's telegram requesting release is understandable from a human perspective, but the matter will still be handled according to the law and without any leniency.

<h3>League of Nations Assembly Indefinitely Postponed</h3>
<p>Representatives of various countries exchange views during recess</p>
<p>Herriot and Litvinov meet for a long time</p>
<p>The Committee of Nineteen convened today by Hymans</p>
<p>Geneva, 29th (National News Agency) The public meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly, held this afternoon, had no significant outcome. Therefore, the meeting scheduled for tomorrow has been declared indefinitely postponed. During the recess, representatives of various countries are still engaged in unofficial discussions. Public meetings will only be convened again when there is a possibility of reaching an agreement. This afternoon, French Prime Minister Herriot met with Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov for a long time. It is reported that the matters discussed were the Franco-Soviet non-aggression pact and the resolution of various related difficulties with Romania.</p>
<h3>Committee of Nineteen Scheduled to Convene Today</h3>
<p>Geneva, 30th (Reuters) The League of Nations Assembly's Committee of Nineteen will be convened tomorrow by its chairman, Hymans, at the request of the Chinese Chief Delegate, Dr. Yen, to jointly determine the deadline by which the League of Nations Council should submit the Lytton Report.</p>
<h3>Henderson's Disarmament Proposal</h3>
<p>Geneva, 30th (Havas) This agency's diplomatic correspondent has learned from official circles in Geneva that the President of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, before leaving Switzerland on Wednesday, submitted a proposal and declaration to several of his colleagues. This declaration suggests that if the nations can agree to this proposal, the work of the conference can resume on October 10th. The purpose of this declaration is to give Germany an opportunity to step down and rejoin the work of the Disarmament Conference. Henderson's proposal uses the following three key points as the basis for discussing the draft Disarmament Convention: (1) Germany must not re-establish its armaments; (2) Other major powers with stronger military forces should implement disarmament; (3) The right to equality in armaments should be formally recognized by the contracting states. It is reported that this proposal and declaration have been accepted by the British delegate Simon, but many representatives of other related countries have objected, as these countries are unwilling to accept it before clarifying the actual effects of implementing this principle.</p>
<h3>Italian Representative Speaks on Disarmament Issues</h3>
<p>Geneva, 29th (Havas) After French Prime Minister Herriot's speech at the League of Nations Assembly today, the Chief Italian Delegate, Aloisi, took the floor and began by mentioning the issue of disarmament, saying that its specialized discussion has taken a long time and gone through various difficulties, and its complexity has made Italy sigh in despair, almost doubting that there is any concrete solution to be found. Aloisi said that the general security should consolidate the position of all countries, and if the people of all countries want to develop their credibility, they must first enable the disarmament conference to achieve results. Without mutual trust between countries, any international organization will be in vain. Aloisi mentioned the economic viewpoint of the peace issue, saying that countries competing for self-defense policies, wanting the impact of general panic to be borne by other countries, is a self-defeating act. Aloisi said that Italy is willing to provide assistance to international actions that are based on sound and enlightened tariff and financial policies. Aloisi described the success of the Stresa Conference as a sign of general economic recovery. He concluded by saying, "The harm suffered by the greater part of the world 'must be presented currently, and then the governments of various countries, compelled by circumstances, will have to seek remedies. This is certainly true. However, it is also necessary to urgently call out on this platform, express credibility for the future, and hope that we can make a decision and maintain it with a kind of will, for will is the only way to solve difficulties."</p>
<h3>Will Japan Ultimately Withdraw from the League of Nations?</h3>
<p>Geneva, 29th (National News Agency) The League of Nations was extremely secretive when typesetting the Lytton Investigation Team's report, even sending private detectives to monitor the typesetters and junior staff to prevent leaks. The report is scheduled to be formally distributed to all member states on Sunday. All printed reports are stored in iron boxes and transported personally by League of Nations printing staff in automobiles. As for the League of Nations' resolution on the Manchurian case, if it is extremely unfavorable to Japan in the future, no one can predict at this time whether Japan will completely withdraw from the League of Nations or only partially withdraw. According to the opinions of international jurists, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations requires two years' advance notice, and even after withdrawal, international obligations should still be fulfilled. Several experts also claim that if Japan publicly withdraws, the South Pacific islands under its mandate must be returned to the League of Nations. Therefore, it is expected that even if Japan wants to withdraw from the League of Nations, it will do so indirectly, first declaring its refusal to attend the Council and the Assembly, which is tantamount to withdrawal, and then following up with technical actions.</p>
<h3>Herriot Receives Representatives from Various Countries</h3>
<p>Geneva, 29th (Havas) Herriot spent the afternoon receiving representatives from various countries, first discussing the extremely complex Baghdad Railway issue with the Turkish Foreign Minister. His most important task was the still unresolved non-aggression treaty between Romania and Soviet Russia. Herriot was well aware that the point of contention between the two countries was Bessarabia, and Soviet Russia was unwilling to re-recognize the inclusion of this area into Romania. Herriot received Litvinov in the evening. Herriot made great efforts to mediate between Litvinov and Romanian Minister of Commerce Mazaru, but as of the evening, the two sides had not yet agreed. Pengu also actively studied plans regarding armaments and security with various experts. The European Problems Committee will review the report of the Stresa Conference tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<h3>German Cabinet Approves External Report</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Havas) German Foreign Minister Neurath returned from Geneva and arrived in Berlin at noon. He immediately met with Papen. A cabinet meeting may be convened today.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Havas) The cabinet unanimously approved Neurath's report, indicating that the German government believes that Germany need not take any action under the current circumstances. Furthermore, the official government newspaper wants to attribute the responsibility for the complete breakdown of negotiations to France and claims that whether or not to reopen negotiations depends entirely on whether France can make a proposal.</p>

<h3>Political Issues Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>Geneva, 29th (Havas) The League of Nations Assembly's Political Issues Committee has recently organized two subcommittees to separately study Iraq's accession to the League of Nations and the issue of slavery. The first subcommittee is composed of representatives from the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, while the second subcommittee is organized by representatives from France, the United Kingdom, India, and other countries. The Political Issues Committee then discussed the cooperation of women in the organization of peace. The statement by the French representative, Madame Sellière, was extremely brilliant, and she put forward a draft resolution requesting that the Council, within its appointed members, employ women as much as possible. In addition, the League of Nations Assembly's Budget Committee discussed the League of Nations' financial situation. Secretary-General Drummond, the Chairman of the Supervisory Committee, and the Italian representative all opposed reducing salaries.</p>
<h3>Bolivia and Paraguay Send Replies</h3>
<p>Geneva, 29th (Havas) After receiving the telegram from the Council of the League of Nations (the telegram was seen in yesterday's telegram from this agency), both Bolivia and Paraguay sent replies. After examining the documents of both sides, the League of Nations seems to favor Paraguay, because the Paraguayan government has made various promises and disarmed in the disputed area, while the Bolivian document (see separate telegram) only recounts past events, attempting to shift responsibility. The Council is scheduled to meet tomorrow morning to decide how to assist the arbitration methods of the American republics.</p>
<p>Geneva, 29th (Havas) The following telegram from Bolivia was sent to the President of the Council of the League of Nations. The message stated, "Your Excellency's telegram of yesterday has been read by our country. We respectfully inform Your Excellency that our country has always been prepared to end the dispute in the Chaco region by direct settlement or legal arbitration. This goal has not changed. Based on this goal, our country has done its best to prevent conflicts within the possible range. Furthermore, in the previous telegram, it was stated that our country had accepted the armistice proposal of the neutral countries, but the key to whether or not the fighting can be stopped does not lie with our country, because the country of Paraguay has adopted an offensive. As of now, Paraguay has not abandoned its offensive. It is hereby declared that, in addition to this, the dispute is being conducted in a track through good-faith mediation by the governments of various neutral countries."</p>
<h3>A Section of Herriot's Speech</h3>
<p>Geneva, 29th (Havas) A section of French Prime Minister Herriot's speech at the League of Nations was quite brilliant, aimed at those who do not believe in the League of Nations. Herriot said that political issues can be observed from various aspects and are extremely complex. Those who are suspicious of the League of Nations want the League of Nations to solve these issues with one stroke, which is regrettable. Herriot wanted to explain to people how the League of Nations is struggling in such difficult circumstances, and said, "The difficulties that arise from all sides, the League of Nations cannot avoid in any way, and the difficulties in the future will only increase. This is what we should bravely say, because the League of Nations' jurisdiction is gradually expanding, and the civilized world is almost under its influence. In the past, a few countries in Europe held the reins of the world, and political issues could not go beyond this scope. Now, everything in the world is gathered in Geneva. The members who join anew and those who leave and return appear every year. It is no longer the same as before. In the past, the issues that arose between countries were purely political in nature, occasionally involving the practical application of certain moral principles. This was still the case in the late eighteenth century. But now, it is not the same. In addition to politics, there is also economic pressure, and the harm of economics arises from machines. When machines first started, everyone thought that the blessing of mankind had arrived, but they did not expect that it would become a source of harm. The so-called distribution of benefits, the development of wealth, or transformation, all give people endless disputes. It is already difficult for us to find a definition for all these things, let alone solve them. Today's League of Nations, in addition to its extremely difficult political adjudication duties, also has its economic arbitration mission. The burden is heavy, as one can imagine. In order to cope with these difficulties, the League of Nations advocated a new method for our use. What is that method? That is, to present all kinds of problems to the public and discuss them openly with honesty. Personally, I hope that those who submit various problems for examination can observe them from all aspects, without harming etiquette, can explain them to each other without any scruples, can have sincere colleagues like all of you to judge them, can state the facts directly, and not ridicule each other with circuitous words, then I would be very fortunate."</p>
<h3>British King Receives Prime Minister</h3>
<p>New Cabinet Appointments Announced</p>
<p>Baldwin Also Appointed Lord Privy Seal</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th - This morning, the King received Prime Minister MacDonald at Buckingham Palace, meeting for over an hour.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th - The King has approved the new cabinet appointments, announced tonight. Lord President of the Council Baldwin will concurrently serve as Lord Privy Seal, but without additional salary. There are minor adjustments to the deputy ministers of various departments. Most notably, Conservative Party member Butler, only thirty years old, born in India, and whose father was a prominent official in India, has been appointed Under-Secretary of State for India. Twenty Labour Party members who support the National Government gathered at the Prime Minister's residence today to discuss the political situation with Prime Minister MacDonald. After the meeting, they issued a statement declaring continued trust in MacDonald's leadership and support for the current government. They also expressed regret that the debate over trade issues, which they considered untimely, has been revived. With internal and external difficulties pressing, returning to the old system of partisan government at this time would not be in the nation's best interest and would violate public opinion. While economic difficulties remain to be resolved and the issues of disarmament and India are becoming increasingly critical, the resignation of cabinet members is disappointing. The nation should continue to concentrate its efforts until a more stable period is reached.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 29th - Lord President of the Council Baldwin will concurrently serve as Lord Privy Seal, filling the vacancy left by Snowden. In addition, Hersee Hubble is appointed Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Buchanan as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, Prime as Parliamentary Secretary to the Colonial Office, Hetland as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport, Butler as Parliamentary Secretary to the India Office, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions remains temporarily vacant.</p>
<h3>Simpson to be Appointed High Commissioner of Danzig</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 29th - Sir John Hope Simpson, the British national who handled the Yangtze River relief efforts in China, is rumored to be appointed High Commissioner of Danzig. Sir Simpson previously served as a Liberal Party Member of Parliament and later as Chairman of the Indian Colonization Committee. Last year, he was elected Director-General of the Huai River Flood Relief Association. He spent several months in China, handling dike construction and relief distribution, braving hardships and saving many lives. From September of last year to June of this year, the Relief Association distributed a total of $66 million in relief funds. All the Yangtze dikes were not only repaired and restored to their original condition but also raised three feet higher than before the disaster. Before Sir Simpson returned to England, over ninety percent of the dikes had been repaired.</p>

<h3>Paraguay Army Wins Victory</h3>
<p>Captures Over a Thousand Enemy Soldiers</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 29th - Peace in South America remains elusive. Almost all South American countries are preparing for war. Although neutral countries are working to mediate between Paraguay and Bolivia, an unofficial war is still ongoing. The Paraguayan government, in its recent public statement, claimed that Paraguayan troops have occupied the Poklon and Toledo fortresses in the Gran Chaco forest area, while the Bolivian government is said to be actively preparing for a long-term resistance. The rebellion in São Paulo, Brazil, has just been quelled, and Chile is reportedly experiencing unrest. According to reports from Santiago, counter-revolutionary activities have begun in Chile. Havas, Paraguayan Capital City, 29th - Bolivian troops stationed at the Bugaron Fortress recently surrendered to Paraguay. The Paraguayan army captured over a thousand officers and soldiers, including two lieutenant colonels.

Upon hearing the news, the President visited the military hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers. All the ships docked in the harbor sounded their horns to celebrate.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Focuses on Increasing Agricultural Production</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 30th - The Soviet government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party yesterday issued a joint announcement, signed by Molotov and Stalin, urging farmers to increase the yield per hectare of farmland by certain methods. It is reported that the Soviet Union's cultivated land has increased by 30,000,000 hectares compared to pre-war levels. Therefore, the first phase of Soviet agricultural development can be considered a success. The current focus should be on increasing agricultural output. Currently, 80% to 90% of the farmland in the main agricultural regions of the Soviet Union has been collectivized, and there are 100,000 tractors in agriculture. Therefore, increasing production is the most important issue. The announcement also specifically stated that the cultivation of industrial crops will not be expanded for the time being, with the exception of grain crops. The 1933 grain planting plan has been set at 97,500,000 hectares, an increase of 1,000,000 hectares compared to this year's spring plowing. The announcement also mentioned the mechanization of agricultural affairs and the use of mechanical production methods, paying particular attention to increasing the production of chemical fertilizers and allocating funds for grain seeds.</p>

<h3>Special Election Set for New York City Mayor</h3>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 29th - The New York City mayoral election has now been confirmed and will be held on October 8th. Today, the Court of Appeals overturned the lower court's ruling, declaring that Acting Mayor McKee's term would not extend beyond December unless re-elected by voters. Therefore, a special mayoral election is inevitable. McKee is expected to continue to run, and former Mayor Walker, who resigned while under investigation by Governor Roosevelt for corruption, is also expected to run. Many speculate that if Walker runs, he will receive the support of a vast majority of voters and be re-elected. Both are Democrats, and if they compete against each other, it will exacerbate the disputes in the presidential election and may affect Roosevelt's presidential candidacy.</p>
<h3>Continued Earthquakes in Greece</h3>
<p>Havas, Salonika, Greece, 29th</p>
<p>More than ten earthquakes struck again last night. The first and last tremors were extremely violent. Walls cracked in over twenty buildings in the city. The dome of the Salonika Bank and part of a chimney collapsed due to the tremors, but fortunately, no one was injured. Most residents have left their homes and are sleeping outdoors. Many have moved from the city to the countryside. Authorities in the Arnaea region telegraphed here, saying that many houses have collapsed. Another strong earthquake occurred at 2:00 p.m. today, causing even more panic among residents. The railway from here to Stravos has been destroyed, completely disrupting transportation between the two places. Dozens of houses have collapsed in nearby Kogalas and Matidon, and the losses in other villages and towns are also significant. Several British warships have arrived at Ierissos, and sailors are distributing food and medicine and participating in relief efforts. In some areas of the Chalkidiki peninsula, the ground has sunk as deep as seven meters, blocking all transportation. The general public is in constant fear and is requesting to be transported to other provinces as soon as possible. Turkish President Kemal, and the Kings of Belgium and Bulgaria, have all sent telegrams to the Greek President expressing their condolences. The Athens newspapers unanimously thanked the various countries for their concern, and particularly praised the assistance of the British warships and the actions of Prime Minister Venizelos.</p>
<p>Havas, Athens, 30th - Salonika residents, unsettled after the earthquake, flocked to Athens yesterday. Land, sea, and air transportation were all extremely crowded.

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 30th - On January 8, Showa 7 (1932), when the Emperor was holding the New Year's Army Review at the Yoyogi drill ground, common people were paying respects as the procession passed by. When the procession passed in front of the Metropolitan Police Department's main gate, as all the people lowered their heads in deep reverence, a Korean man, Lee Bong-chang (32), suddenly threw a bomb at the Emperor's procession (he was standing in the triangular safety zone in front of the Metropolitan Police Department). He was immediately arrested. At 9:00 a.m. today, Chief Justice Niwa of the Daijin-in (Supreme Court) presided over a public special trial. Chief Justice Niwa announced a death sentence according to Article 73 of the Penal Code. The defendant, Lee Bong-chang, was prepared and showed no change in expression, only nodding his head slightly.

<h3>Slight Decrease in German Unemployment Figures</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 29th - The total number of unemployed workers in Germany is currently 7,160,000. This is a decrease compared to the beginning of this year, when the total number of unemployed workers was 7,860,000. According to official figures, the number of unemployed workers is 5,261,000. However, the unemployed workers who do not receive any state or local relief and are not included in any statistical table are naturally not included in this number. According to academic institutions, this number of unemployed workers is estimated to be approximately 1,900,000.</p>

<h3>Nevada Shipwreck</h3>
<p>Reuters, San Francisco, 29th - The ship Nevada ran aground on an island in the Bering Sea and sent a radio message requesting help. The Japanese freighter Oregon Maru and the American ship President Madison both heard the alarm and rushed to the rescue. When the Japanese freighter arrived, it saw that the Nevada had crashed into the rocks and the hull was broken. The wind was very strong, and the lifeboats could not move forward, causing concern that the 35 crew members could not be rescued. Later, it was learned that the crew had abandoned ship and landed safely. As for the Nevada, it seems to have been completely lost. The crew is safe and sound on Aniakchak Island.</p>
<p>Reuters, San Francisco, 30th - The news received here yesterday that the crew of the Nevada were safe was unfortunately inaccurate. According to a radio message from the American ship President Madison, which is carrying the survivors to Seattle, at least 32 of the 35 people on board the Nevada have drowned.</p>
<h3>Lancashire Cotton Industry May Shut Down</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th - The Lancashire cotton industry strike has not completely ended. Although the wage agreement for weavers was reached last week, the dispute for spinners has now erupted. Today, representatives of the yarn mills and the spinners gathered in Manchester for six hours to discuss the wage reduction issue, but no agreement was reached. The mill owners agreed to reduce the spinners' wages by 15.5%, as was done for the weaving mills, but the spinners' representatives refused, still insisting on the previous proposal of a 7.5% wage reduction or 10 pence per pound. The mill owners' wage reduction notice will expire on October 15th, and the spinners claim that they will resist. The cotton industry seems likely to shut down again soon.</p>
<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>Telegram from Beiping: To all newspapers, it is hereby noted that the National Government has decided to temporarily abolish the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, considering the importance of Hebei's defense. A Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government should be established to oversee the region. In addition, the National Government has ordered the appointment of Wang Shuhan, Wan Fulin, Zhang Zuoxiang, Zhang Qun, Han Fuju, Xu Yongchang, Wang Shuchang, Song Zheyuan, Bao Wenyue, Yu Xuezhong, Shang Zhen, Rong Zhen, Pang Bingxun, Shen Honglie, Tang Yulin, Jiang Bocheng, Liu Yifei, and Xiao Zhenying as members of the Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission; designating Wan Fulin, Rong Zhen, and Jiang Bocheng as standing members of the Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission; and appointing Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, as Chairman of the Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission. This order, etc. In accordance with this, all organizations were completed on the 26th of this month and officially established. Before the official seal is issued, the old seal of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters will be used temporarily. In addition to reporting to the National Government and the Military Affairs Commission for record, this is respectfully reported. The Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government.</p>
<p>Telegram from Hankou: To all newspapers, Chiang Kai-shek has been ordered to be stationed in Hankou to supervise the suppression of the Communist bandits. Thanks to the joint efforts of the military and civilians, we have been clearing the path and gradually eliminating the bandits. However, in the recovered areas, everything has been destroyed. There are no houses that have not been burned, no trees that have not been felled, no chickens or dogs left, and no oxen that have not been killed. According to reports from front-line generals in the past half-month, places such as Shangcheng, Guangshan, and Gushi in Henan Province; Liu'an, Huoqiu, Yingshan, and Huoshan in Anhui Province; and Huang'an, Macheng, Luotian, Mianyang, and Jianli in Hubei Province are all like remote borderlands, desolate and without smoke. I only hear cries in the wilderness, or even tens of thousands of people, kneeling before the army, haggard and gaunt, lying stiffly on the roadside. After reviewing these reports, I am deeply saddened. I have sent telegrams to the governments of the three provinces to expedite the allocation of relief funds and food, and to send personnel to provide relief. I have also issued a notice on the reduction and exemption of land taxes in the bandit suppression areas to be followed, in order to provide stability. However, the recovered areas have been in turmoil for a long time, and the disasters are deep. There are many people waiting for relief, and the areas waiting for relief are vast. The food available for relief is limited, and the funds for relief are meager. In the blink of an eye, autumn will end and winter will come, and the thought of people freezing and starving to death is unbearable. Chiang Kai-shek deeply believes that even a loving mother cannot protect her children from hunger and cold, and that famine is the source of great chaos, and great chaos is followed by famine, mutually reinforcing each other. If we do not properly plan for the aftermath, local stability and the restoration of order will never be achieved. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all people's organizations, charitable institutions, and wealthy individuals will do their best to collect large sums of money for relief and report the amount collected to this headquarters for verification and allocation. It should be understood that on this day of multiple disasters, to save oneself, one must first save others. If the country is not at peace, how can one protect one's family? It should also be understood that saving people is not only out of compassion but also a matter of duty. We should actively participate, so that the survivors can have hope of rebirth, and that there will be an opportunity for society to recover. Fortune, misfortune, security, and danger are shared by all the people of the country. Furthermore, since the start of the military campaign, not only has the turmoil been more severe than in the past, but also frugality has declined compared to the past. Cities have become increasingly extravagant, while rural areas have become increasingly impoverished. If this continues, it will only lead to ruin, and even without foreign enemies, we cannot avoid destruction. I also hope that the leaders of schools and organizations, as well as the women's community, will organize inspection groups to personally inspect the disaster areas in batches, to understand the true situation and plan for relief. This headquarters will provide protection and facilitate their travel, so that the whole country, from top to bottom, will be aware of this deplorable situation, advocate simplicity and frugality, and restore rural areas and promote the sale of agricultural products as the goal and path for all Chinese people. I hope you will carefully consider this. Chiang Kai-shek, 30th.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Fighting Continues in Shandong, Central Government to Send Observers to Monitor Ceasefire</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the war in Jiaodong, the central government, fearing that it would affect the overall situation during this time of national crisis, specifically telegraphed both Han and Liu, ordering them to immediately cease military action. Jiang Bocheng also came to Shandong to convey Commander Chiang's order, ordering a ceasefire first, and then discussing the aftermath. Han Fuju met with Jiang in Shahe on the 23rd and immediately issued a circular telegram that evening, reporting the ceasefire, and returned to Jinan to await the central government's aftermath measures. However, for the past week, front-line telegrams have reported that Liu's troops in Yexian are still causing disturbances and the artillery fire is still fierce. Today, I visited Jiang Bocheng to inquire about everything. According to Jiang, although the war in eastern Shandong is said to have stopped, Chairman Han reported that Liu's troops were still causing disturbances, while Liu reported that Han's troops were still applying pressure. Each side has its own story, and the central government does not know the truth. I (Jiang himself) telegraphed Commander Chiang, requesting that people be sent to Shandong to inspect the front lines of both sides. Last night, I received a reply telegram that Li Yue, a major general counselor of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and Fan Yuhuang, a colonel staff officer, have been dispatched to Shandong soon. Each side will send one person to inspect and monitor the implementation of the ceasefire by both sides in order to discuss the aftermath measures. I asked if the aftermath measures have been decided, and if the reports that Liu's defense zone will be reduced and that the provincial government will assist Liu's army with 140,000 yuan per month were true. Jiang said that if this is done, it would be a way to resolve the situation, but he has not heard of this regulation. The central government is carefully considering how to resolve this matter, as it must take both sides into account and plan thoroughly before starting. It is unlikely that the war will escalate, and the second step of the aftermath measures is the most important. Zhang Yue, Chairman Han's representative, met with Minister He (Yingqin) in Beijing yesterday and is leaving Beijing again today to go to Guling to meet with Commander Chiang. Whether Liu's unit will reduce its defense zone or be transferred elsewhere will definitely be decided. (28th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Reduces Government Expenses</h3>
<p>Annual Savings of 960,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong province has recently been facing heavy military expenses. Although Chen Jitang announced some time ago that monthly expenses would be reduced from 4.7 million yuan to 4.3 million yuan, the monthly expense of over 4 million yuan still accounts for a large portion of the revenue, making the budget still tight. Therefore, the Guangdong Provincial Government decided to reduce the administrative expenses of provincial-level institutions. If the reduction in administrative expenses is implemented, it will save approximately 960,000 yuan per year. The administrative expenses being reduced include construction, finance, education, and civil affairs. The relevant agencies have prepared standards and submitted them to the 116th Provincial Affairs Meeting for deliberation and approval. The following is an investigation of the reduced administrative expense items: (A) Administrative Expenses: (1) Expenses for each county government: The expenses for the eighteen first-class counties are 3,580 yuan per month, totaling 64,440 yuan. This will be reduced to 80%, saving 12,888 yuan per month, or 154,656 yuan per year. (2) Expenses for the Training Institute for Autonomous Work Personnel: The annual expense is 364,468 yuan, which will be reduced by 60,000 yuan per year. (3) Salary and travel expenses for local autonomy assistants: The annual expense is 69,600 yuan, which will be reduced by half, saving 34,800 yuan per year. (4) The Han River Guard Battalion will be disbanded, saving the monthly subsidy of 4,248 yuan from the provincial treasury and the annual temporary expenses of 5,000 yuan, for a total annual savings of 55,976 yuan. (B) Financial Expenses: (1) The Chaoshan District Collection Office of the Finance Department can be abolished, saving 12,180 yuan per year. (2) The expenses of the Foshan Supplementary Tax Bureau of the Finance Department are 5,604 yuan per year. It is now changed to commercial management and publicly bid for, and this expense can be completely saved. (C) Educational and Cultural Expenses: (1) Expenses for the provincial vocational school: It is found that the school has not yet been organized and will be paid for next year, saving 120,000 yuan per year. (2) The construction fee of 50,000 yuan for the Shipai Horse Racing Ground will be completely cut. (D) Agricultural and Mining Expenses: (1) The Soil Survey Institute affiliated to the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau will be abolished, saving more than 2,000 yuan per month, or 24,000 yuan per year. (E) Industrial and Commercial Expenses: (1) The Bureau of Weights and Measures will be abolished, saving 23,712 yuan per year. (F) Construction Expenses: (1) The allocated funds of 400,000 yuan for the Xicun Cement Plant will be repaid from the plant's profits, and this expense can be completely saved. (G) Assistance Expenses: (1) The subsidy to the Guangdong Office of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions will be cut, saving 3,000 yuan per year. (2) The subsidy to the Party-run Poor People's Hospital will be cut, saving 2,400 yuan per year. In total, the above will save 961,376 yuan per year. (September 22nd)</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Communist Suppression in the Guangdong Border</h3>
<p>Communist Bandits in the Vicinity of Wuping and Xinfeng are Being Defeated One After Another</p>
<p>Xiang Hanping Returns to the Province, Qu Shounian Comes to Guangdong on a Mission</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: The Communist bandits of Fujian and Jiangxi have recently been continuously pressured by the armies of various provinces. The remaining bandits are fleeing south in droves. The main force of the bandit army is still in Ruijin and Huichang in eastern Jiangxi, using Changting as a barrier. The 19th Route Army of Fujian Province has recently gone straight to western Fujian, advancing towards Changting. The 19th Route Army's Shen Guanghan Division and Deng Zhicai Brigade captured Longyan at the beginning of the month and are now stationed at Shizhong. Qu Shounian's Division is gathered at Hexi, connecting with Shen's division. On the 18th of this month, Qu's division advanced to Longshan again, while Shen's division and Deng's brigade moved from Longyan to Kanshi, attacking the Communist bandits in Kanshi and Fushi together with the 49th Division of the Central Army, Xiao Yuesheng's Brigade. In the area along the Guangdong-Fujian border, the First Independent Division and the Eighth Division of the Third Army under Chen Jitang's command are deployed in Xunwu, Shanghang, and Wuping. The Eighth Division of the Third Army has successively burned down the bandit nests and obstacles south of Xunwu. The First Independent Division ordered the Fourth Regiment of the Second Brigade, led by Li Hengzhong, on the 21st of this month to advance and suppress the local Communists in Tingtou Market, which belongs to Wuping County. At about 6 p.m. that afternoon, they arrived more than ten miles away from Tingtou and set up camp. At about 4 a.m. on the 22nd, they came into contact with more than a thousand Communist bandits in Tingtou Market. The bandit gangs stubbornly resisted from their fortified positions, and after a fierce battle for two hours, the bandit crowd</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>could not withstand the assault and fled towards Taoxi. Li's regiment dispatched a small part to track down and search, while the main part remained to guard the county seat of Wuping. On the Jiangnan front, a group of Communist bandits launched a fierce attack on Xinfeng a few days ago, but were repelled. Afterwards, they continued to attack with small groups from time to time. Wang Zanbin's Division of the Gui Army, stationed in Sengfeng, specially dispatched the Pang Battalion under its command to search in Niujing on the 23rd, and found six or seven hundred Communist bandits there. After a fierce battle for three hours, the bandits could not withstand the assault and fled towards Lishi and Shuangxikou in two routes. Because the terrain there was complex and the weather was late, the Pang Battalion did not pursue them and camped in Xinniu Market to await orders. As for Sannan on the Jiangxi border, it is currently defended by Zhang Meixin's Division of the Second Army. Zhang returned to the province a few days ago to report on the border situation and flew back to Longnan defense area by plane on the 22nd. Xiang Hanping, the Commander of the Second Army, took advantage of the return of Zhang, the Division Commander, to return to the province himself to coordinate the bandit suppression plan with the local authorities. He specially accompanied the staff of the Second Army Headquarters back to Guangdong, departed from Longnan for Wengyuan on the 24th, escorted by a battalion of soldiers dispatched by the Wu Regiment of the Fourth Division. It is estimated that they will arrive in Shaoguan via Wengyuan around the 25th and return to the province by plane from Shaoguan today (the 26th). It is also reported that Qu Shounian, the Division Commander of the 19th Route Army, also arrived in Hong Kong by boat from Fujian on the 25th and will come to the province today to participate in the meeting to suppress the Communist bandits in Jiangxi and discuss various issues.

<h3>Xunwu, Jiangnan Ravaged by Bandits</h3>
<p>Shantou dispatch: Xunwu County is located in the key area of the three provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, with fertile soil and abundant agricultural products, and honest customs. Since the 17th year of the Republic of China, Communist bandits have been rampant, and the essence has been lost. Especially this year's tragic robberies have been even worse. Starting in March, the two groups of Communist bandits, Li Mingrui and Luo Binghui, captured Xunwu City. The guards, bandit suppression groups, and all the people's armed forces were disarmed. Party, government, and military responsible persons such as Pan Mengchun were brutally killed by the bandits. The local local Communists were even more violent. The people who fled to other villages could not make a living because they had been away from home for a long time. Moreover, the cost of living on the Guangdong border was several times higher than that of the major cities. Rice was transported from abroad and Chaoshan, costing three yuan per dou. They were not full, and they did not see meat all year round. Everyone was emaciated and looked like hungry prisoners. The people in the bandit areas who did not escape suffered the brutal oppression of the Soviet Red Guards at the county, district, and township levels. They suffered even more than they could survive and could not die. According to the latest escapees from the bandit areas, after the bandits failed to attack Fuzhou and Yihuang in eastern Jiangxi a few days ago, the bandit areas were sealed off by the National Army on all sides. The bandits are still trying to make a final struggle and are divided into two types of active work: (1) Forcing farmers and strong men to serve as Red Guards, adding a little training in running, shooting guns on mountain tops, etc., and then joining the Red Company. The Red Company is then incorporated into the transfer department's division. They are escorted to the front line to fight against the National Army. Machine guns and political companies are used behind them to supervise the team. If the forced farmers are slightly weak and retreat, they are often strafed with machine guns. Therefore, many farmers died. After the Red Guards are promoted to the Red Company, they search for strong men again and force them to fill the quota. All strong men around the age of 20 are forced to be replenished, and no one is spared. The family, father and son, know that this trip will inevitably fill the ditches, and they are heartbroken. However, under the mouths of guns and cannons, there is no way to get rid of it, and they also go sadly. (2) Extorting money and food from the people. All the people who have not escaped from southern Jiangxi whose food and clothing are enough to support themselves are designated as rich peasants or local tyrants. First, they are fined a certain amount of money, forcing them to admit this name. Those who violate it will be subjected to severe torture. Those who cannot withstand the torture and die are countless. When the fines have been paid, some people harbor grudges or slander and accuse them, and those who are sentenced to be beheaded, dissected abdomens, controlled hearts, and broken legs are also difficult to count. Recently, Deng Zihui and Zhang Guoshou, the financial commissioners of the pseudo-Central Government in Ruijin, issued 600,000 yuan of war bonds, divided into three-, five-, and one-yuan denominations. They strictly ordered the Soviet governments of various counties, districts, and townships to assign and persuade sales within a time limit, and cast hundreds of thousands of tin coins, strictly forcing the people to use and circulate them. In addition, there are so-called preferential treatment for the Red Army expenses, red aircraft donations, land taxes, and other items. The means of scraping the people are new. Good people in the bandit areas cannot escape. This is the recent measure of the Red bandits. The Red bandits in the northern border of Xunwu are stationed by the Eighth Regiment of the pseudo-Independent Third Division. Together with the local Red Guards, there are only five or six hundred people. Each person's bullets are all made by the indigenous people, with only about thirty rounds on their waists. There are also three machine guns, only one of which can be used. On September 7, the Guangdong Army Zhu Battalion Commander stationed in Niudouguang and the Yang Battalion Commander stationed in Pingyuan led troops to cover the people's regiment and recovered Jitan Market. The regiment army was only stationed in Jitan for two days and handed over the follow-up to the self-organized Shanhou by the Min Tuan Gu Le San Deng. The Guangdong Army still returned to the original defenses of Pingyuan Niudouguang. Most of the Min Tuan troops were not trained, the ammunition was insufficient, and their strength was weak. Only the Fifth District Joint Defense Team of Huichang and the Pan Jindao Department of the Third District were more combative. After Jitan Market was handed over to the Min Tuan, it was lost again after being stationed for only a few days. When retreating, more than ten bandits were killed, and the Min Tuan was not damaged at all. In the long-term red areas in the southern part of Xunwu, most of the large villages have become barren mounds. All the young men and women have been fighting each other since there were two factions, CP and AB, within the Red Bandits, and thousands have been killed. Later, local tyrants and thugs colluded with the Min Tuan, in the name of suppressing bandits, went to various villages in southern Xunwu, and abducted and sold young men and women and middle-aged women to Xingning and Pingyuan. No less than two or three thousand people have died in artillery fire during previous military suppressions. There are also tens of thousands of people who are now lucky to have the Guangdong Army Zhong Junfang, Luo Fengxiang, Xie Zheng and other regiments, together with County Magistrate Xie, adopt both suppression and appeasement measures, so the local area has been slightly calmed down.

<h3>Xiao Lin's Mission to Siam</h3>
<p>Related to the Signing of a Commercial Treaty between China and Siam</p>
<p>Shantou dispatch: There are about 1.5 million overseas Chinese in Siam. China and Siam have close relations. However, in the imperial era of 1930, the Siamese government gradually excluded overseas Chinese. For example, most of the rice produced in the country was operated by overseas Chinese. The Siamese government even proposed to take it back into state-owned management, and increased the landing import tax for overseas Chinese, at 45 baht per person (about 90 yuan). It also implemented assimilation education, requiring the principals of overseas Chinese schools to use Siamese teachers, teachers to pass Siamese language examinations, and textbooks to be reviewed and approved by the government. The severe oppression caused a rift between people from China and Siam. However, the Siamese government regarded us as a nation without a treaty. When there were major events to be negotiated, it had to be decided by our country's ambassador to Japan and the Siamese ambassador to Japan. Our government once regarded the signing of a commercial treaty between China and Siam as important. Therefore, in 1929, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent Cheng Tongsheng to Siam to investigate. The call for the signing of a treaty between China and Siam was quite high because of this, but later it subsided again. This year, the Siamese People's Party overthrew the imperial government. The leaders of the People's Party strongly expressed their pro-China policy. The representative Zhang Wutiesai said in a speech at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Siam: There is no nation in the world that has such a close relationship as China and Siam. The Siamese nation can be said to have originated entirely from China. Examining ancient history and verifying all the things, customs, etiquette, beliefs, and habits that have been preserved, Chinese and Siamese human history are completely in line with the good friends who should coexist and prosper in the Far East and cannot be separated. The new Siamese government is now eagerly seeking to improve Sino-Siamese relations, eliminate all obstacles and restraints, and welcome the hardworking, thrifty, loyal, and gentle Chinese to Siam with 120,000 points of sincerity to jointly live and work to develop the economies of China and Siam and coexist and prosper forever. Since Siam's policy towards China has changed, in order to promote Sino-Siamese friendship, our country ordered Xie Xiang, the Consul in Penang, to take a car to Bangkok to make a preliminary attempt to discuss a commercial treaty. Before the commercial treaty is completed, a commercial commissioner will be temporarily established to promote Sino-Siamese trade. At the same time, the Siamese government also has considerable respect for the Guangdong Provincial Government, because people from Guangdong Province account for more than 90% of the overseas Chinese in Siam. Xiao Focheng and Lin Yizhong therefore made a trip to Siam. Xiao has lived in Siam for decades and is well aware of the situation of overseas Chinese in Siam and the accumulated cases between China and Siam over the years. It is said that the Sino-Siamese commercial treaty depends entirely on Xiao Lin's trip. If the result is satisfactory, Xiao Zisongjian has a good chance of being stationed as a commercial commissioner in Siam. Xie Xiang is also waiting for Xiao Lin in Bangkok, Siam. (September 24)</p>
<h3>Journey to the West (2) (10) (9)</h3>
<p>A Night of Startled Birds and Crying Cranes</p>
<p>Since Yichuan, our biggest purpose has been to investigate the waterfalls of Longmen and the coal fields of Hancheng. We originally planned to go to Hancheng via Jiyi Town and Longmen, which is about 200 li. However, because bandits are rampant on this road, the strength of a hundred soldiers cannot guarantee that no accidents will happen. So in the end, we changed our route. The first day we prepared to walk 70 li, rest in Gejiawan, and stay overnight in Gutai Street. The second day we prepared to walk 90 li, rest in Shendao Ridge (also known as Daling), and stay overnight in Yu Village. The third day we prepared to walk 80 li, rest in Xuefeng Town, and stay overnight in Hancheng, our destination. This route seemed safer, but it was more than 20 li longer than the original route. Originally, the so-called li in northern Shaanxi is divided into big li and small li. A small li is the usual length of a li, while 80 li in a big li sometimes exceeds 100 li in a small li. We have taken the road with big li more often before, and this time it is the same.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 7th, when we were awakened by the sound of bells in our sleep, we looked up at the sky, and the stars were still very bright, twinkling like autumn water rippling and winking at people. At the same time, the wisps of silk in the sky clearly transmitted the majestic sound of bugles, reporting that the armed comrades were also all getting up and preparing to set off. The road that day was unexpectedly lined with high mountains. Walking in the flat valley, whether on horseback or in a goose nest, you could browse the natural scenery. On the journey, you could often see clouds rising in secluded places and mixed flowers reflecting on your face. The lonely mountains and rivers rarely saw human traces. At 11 a.m., we arrived at Gejiawan, where we were going to rest.</p>
<p>"Can we eat steamed buns?" A tired soldier, holding his rations, sat on a stone and asked a companion. "It's best to ask the officer," his solemn companion replied, seemingly full of the spirit of obedience.</p>
<p>"Eating steamed buns requires asking the officer, then do you need a passport to pee?" A soldier standing in the third position jokingly interrupted the conversation, so everyone burst out laughing and the hard-working soldiers who were walking sat down and ate the rations they had like a whirlwind.</p>
<p>Although I was in a cowshed where cow dung was still present, covered with dead branches and surrounded by the forever annoying flies that seemed to be very energetic and flying up and down, but we enjoyed ourselves and naturally could no longer worry about hygiene and ate meat buns. At 12:30, everyone's stomachs were filled with water and food, and they regained their spirits to move forward. At that time, those of us riding horses whipped our horses and galloped like lightning. As far as the eye could see, only green mountains and white clouds quickly retreated behind us. Before 4 p.m., we arrived at Gitai Street, where we planned to stay overnight.</p>
<p>Gitai Street is a very small town, with only three or four shops. Because it has been ravaged by bandits several times, the desolate scene can be seen everywhere from the dilapidated houses. This is an area surrounded by bandits. When we first arrived, the truth was unknown and we were very happy in spirit. Walking in the streets where the stones were uneven, you could see the literature of the people on the walls of the houses: "A bad dream is written on the west wall, and when the sun shines on it, it turns into good luck" and "The door of the night shop opens to the west, the east wind blows the merchants to come, the south wind blows the business full, and the north wind blows a fortune." They were everywhere, and the door of the shop where we were going, which had horses and people in the same room, also had the slogan "Li Bai asks whose house is tall, Liu Ling says this place is good." The tone was still very ostentatious.</p>
<p>The sad wind, the setting sun, and the dark evening colors gradually came, and the sound of vigilance gradually reached our ears. Everyone inevitably became a little apprehensive. At that time, the soldiers had put on bayonets and were guarding the key points strictly. At 8 o'clock, a temporary curfew was announced. Even if one's own people went out, they needed a password. In the silent night light, the air suddenly became tense. During dinner, Zhang Mofu reported to everyone: "There are small groups of bandits entrenched in the southeast pass here. Please be careful tonight. But if there is gunfire, you don't need to panic. Please still sleep soundly and don't leave your house, because we estimate that the strength of all our armed comrades is enough to deal with them."</p>
<p>In terms of the situation, the location of Gitai Street is really bad. It is surrounded by high mountains, and the town is at the low point of the mountains. If a few bandits occupy the high ground on the top of the mountain in the dark night and shoot at us, we will be like fish in a pot and will only be able to wait to die. Fortunately, Battalion Commander Liu has a good plan. He first ordered the militia familiar with the terrain to be on alert at high places, while the soldiers strictly guarded the dangerous areas in the mountains. The soldiers patrolling the streets never stopped all night. The gentle moonlight shone on the dead street, which was full of fear, adding to people's fear. "Do you like the moonlight?" I asked a soldier standing at the door. They were carrying bayoneted guns and working hard for us all night. "No, no, I don't like the moonlight, because under this moonlight, we are the best target for bandits." He replied with his military knowledge. Alas, it is the same moonlight, maybe someone in the village of Riva Litan in Shanghai is praising her clarity and her beauty with a partner. Thousands of families are thinking about the cool night, and thousands of miles are covered with bright light, but here it makes people quiet and without power, and cannot get people's welcome. The object of joy and sorrow can be seen to have no certain standard. Finally, the soldier told me that the general password that night was "prosperity and strength," and the special password was "improve the countryside." Because I had nothing to do to go out, I knew it but didn't use it. When I went to bed at 9:30, I found a few places behind the house where I could avoid bullets as a preparation for unforeseen circumstances. There were also many people who slept with their clothes on and put their shoes beside their pillows to avoid being caught off guard.</p>
<p>Like this, we spent a night of startled birds and crying cranes, with every plant and tree seeming like a bandit. It was easy to wait until dawn on the 8th. (To be continued)</p>

They have been working at the shop for two years. During this year's Mid-Autumn Festival, Deng Aqi was fired for some reason, and he was stimulated and became mentally disordered. Because he had no place to stay, he asked Xu Maosheng for help. However, at about 10 p.m. on the 29th, after the two entered the shop, Xu Maosheng suddenly shouted for help. Neighbors heard the sound and knew something had happened, so they reported it to the police. They climbed in from the Yue Dong next door and saw Aqi lying stiffly in the stove room, with blood flowing everywhere. He had already died. They went to the small loft to check and found Xu Maosheng also lying on the bed, with blood and flesh blurred and only a breath remaining.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Court Bailiff Punished for Accepting Bribes Chen Tiancai, a bailiff in the Zhenjiang Court Procuratorate's detention room, accepted 200 yuan from a certain opium offender who entrusted him on the 13th of this month and begged the court's forensic doctor to prove that he was not addicted when examining him. After Chen received the bribe, he turned to ask the forensic doctor to take care of him. However, the forensic doctor's examination was still ineffective. The parties concerned negotiated with Chen Tiancai and at the same time asked Tang, the prosecutor who was hearing the case, to be lenient in handling the case. Prosecutor Tang abided by the law and reported to the Chief Prosecutor Xu, who immediately assigned Prosecutor Tang to investigate the case. Chen Tiancai was found to have a major suspicion of accepting and offering bribes and was transferred to the Criminal Court for public trial in accordance with the criminal law. As a result, Chen Tiancai was sentenced to two months' imprisonment and fined 100 yuan. As for the forensic doctor, there was insufficient evidence that he had accepted bribes, so he was not prosecuted. The case has been finalized, and Chen Tiancai was transferred to the Zhenjiang County Prison for execution yesterday (30th).</p>

Now, Lu Xiaobo, the Chairman of the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, believes that the Daosheng robbery occurred in a commercial area, and if the case is not solved, it will have a significant impact on local security. Yesterday, he specially telegraphed Director Zou, issuing another notice that anyone who can solve the case will be rewarded with 1,000 yuan in cash.</p>

<h3>Educational Facilities of the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Cleanliness Issues of Subsidized Schools</p>
<p>The Chinese private schools subsidized by the Shanghai Municipal Council should prioritize the equipment for cleanliness with the subsidy fees. However, the Education Committee intends that this equipment should only be practical and not extravagant. If the school site is rented, it is even more unnecessary, so as not to benefit the landlord in vain. In the future, when issuing subsidies, the report of the head of the Health Bureau should be considered first. After the funds are allocated, the bureau should conduct inspections at any time.</p>
<p>Tuition Fees for Western Parents</p>
<p>If the parents of students in the Shanghai Municipal Council's Western schools are not residents of the concession or taxpayers, they should pay an additional quarter of the tuition fee. However, if the parents are members of the South China Businessmen's Association or special police officers, they will still be exempt from the additional fee. The Education Committee has requested the Board of Directors to allow parents who serve as volunteer firefighters to be exempt from this additional fee. It was previously suggested that a certain number of free places be set up in Western schools. It has now been decided that this free system will be considered after it is implemented in Chinese schools.</p>
<p>The Question of Increasing Chinese Elementary Schools</p>
<p>Two members of the Education Committee wrote to the Director-General, suggesting that the elementary school near Nie Zhongcheng Public School should be opened in the spring of next year, and another elementary school should be rented in the winter of the same year. Construction of a girls' middle school should begin next year. The Director-General replied that the Shanghai Municipal Council's financial situation for next year is still unclear, and it is unknown whether there will be sufficient funds for this construction. The matter should be postponed for now.</p>
<p>St. Francis Asks to Continue to Be Exempted from Housing Tax</p>
<p>St. Francis School is unable to apply for subsidies due to the school's charter. It has requested the Shanghai Municipal Council to continue to be exempted from housing tax, to be paid from the general reserve fund. The Education Committee believes that this matter is not within the scope of the committee and should be discussed by the Finance Committee.</p>

<h3>New Basketball Techniques (5) (Not to Be Reproduced) Original by Cljre Burcky Translated and Compiled by Zhang Guoxun and Qian Yiqin</h3>
<p>The control of the center jump is the first step in basketball offense. Therefore, the tallest player or the player who jumps the highest is often appointed as the center to give the team a lot of advantages.</p>
<p>The referee tosses the ball upward between the two centers. The two players must stand within their own semicircles. The height of the tossed ball must be higher than the point that the two players can possibly reach. Before the ball is tapped out, neither player may leave the center circle.</p>
<p>After the ball reaches a considerable height and falls, each center must not tap more than twice. After that, the center may not touch the ball again until the ball has been touched by the other eight players or has touched the basket ring, backboard, or floor. If the ball falls without being tapped by either center, the referee should re-toss the ball in the same spot.</p>
<p>The above rules must also be followed for non-center circle jumps. The jumpers must not use their hips to bump people, push people, or use their arms to make actions against the opponent, otherwise it will be considered a personal foul.</p>

<p>Flew from Lushan to Nanjing Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Flew from Nanjing to Shanghai in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Song Ziwen, the acting president of the Executive Yuan, flew to Nanjing on the 27th of last month by Sikorsky aircraft. The next day, he went to Lushan to visit Chairman Chiang for consultations. He completed his public duties at 7 a.m. yesterday, and still took the original plane leaving Lushan. At noon, he arrived in Nanjing. After lunch in Nanjing and a brief rest, he took off from Nanjing around 3 p.m. to return to Shanghai. He arrived at Hongqiao Airport at 4:30 p.m., and immediately took a car back to his residence to rest. Those who came with Acting President Song were Song's secretary, Huang Chun-dao, Shen Qing-yi, a counselor from the Ministry of Finance, and Li Ying-chao, Zhang Xueliang's representative, and four advisors, including Duan Ne. According to Acting President Song, he told reporters that this trip to Lushan to visit Chairman Chiang was to discuss financial matters and there were no other tasks.</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin's Activities Yesterday</h3>
<p>Stayed at the Residence All Day Without Going Out</p>
<p>Dr. Lu Zhong'an Provided Treatment</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, National Government Chairman Lin Sen has not yet met with Sun Zhesheng. Mr. Lin suffers from rheumatism and feels itchy in his limbs, so he stayed at the residence all day yesterday without going out. At noon, he only met with Ouyang Nan and Huang Jusu. In the afternoon, he invited Dr. Lu Zhong'an to provide treatment.</p>
<h3>The Arsenal Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Liquidation Committee Was Established to Work</p>
<p>All Factory Employees Were Separately Retained and Dismissed</p>
<p>Department Heads Were Transferred to Nanjing for Employment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Arsenal was officially declared closed yesterday. All the factory's employees were separately dismissed and retained. Regarding the aftermath, the Ordnance Department sent personnel to Shanghai yesterday to establish a Liquidation Committee at the factory, which is scheduled to start work today. Jiangnan's only arsenal for decades has thus come to an end. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Handover Committee After the factory was ordered to close, Factory Director Song Shi ordered his subordinates to expedite the handover. Therefore, most of the documents have been checked and are awaiting the committee's acceptance. It is expected to be completed in about ten days.</p>
<p>Employee Disposal All 70+ employees of the factory were ordered to retain or dismiss a few days ago. The dismissed ones include Long Ying, Director of the General Affairs Department, Yi Zuzu, Chief of the Accounting Section, Peng Zhenzhi, Chief of the General Affairs Section, Zhang Zhihe, Chief of the Document Section, Xiang Jingfang, Chief of the Medical Section, Zhang Zuliang, Chief of the Armory, Lin Tongyu, Chief of the Audit Section, Cao Guangyun, Director of the Material Depot, and 22 staff members. In addition, 52 employees were retained and assigned work by the Liquidation Committee. Liu Shouyu, Chief of the Engineering Department, was appointed by the Ordnance Department as a member of the Liquidation Committee. Others, such as Ma Dejian, Director of the Machinery Department, Li Chengshu, Director of the Pharmaceutical Factory, Wang Chengfu, Director of the Shell Factory, Kang Renchu, Director of the Rifle Factory, Chen Shihong, Director of the Cannon Factory, and Lin Weirong, Director of the Bullet Factory, were all ordered to be transferred to the Ordnance Department and required to report to duty immediately. The guard team was temporarily retained, and half of the public servants were dismissed. Each dismissed employee was issued one month's salary. However, the employees who were previously dismissed were issued three months' salary by the Ordnance Department, but now only one month is issued, which is unfair. Therefore, a request has been submitted to the Ministry to issue three months' salary as per the previous precedent.</p>
<p>Worker Dismissal The Cannon Factory of the arsenal was ordered by the Ordnance Department to extend for six months after the January 28th Incident because it was necessary to repair military supplies sent from various parties. It was not until the end of September that work was stopped. All 180+ workers were dismissed with two months' wages, except for 20 who were retained for dispatch.</p>
<p>Committee Establishment Since the Ordnance Department has concluded that the factory has been closed, a special person should be responsible for all the aftermath. Therefore, special personnel were sent to Shanghai to organize the Liquidation Committee. In addition to Liu Shouyu, the Chief of the Engineering Department of the factory, the committee members include Zhuang Quan, Li Shiqiong, Zheng Jiajun, Shou Changtian, and Zhou Dianli, and seven others from the Ordnance Department, who have all come to Shanghai. They are scheduled to go to the factory today to start work, take over various affairs. The office location is in the original Engineering Department of the factory. Currently, a portion of machinery, materials, unusable old cannons, waste copper, and rusted iron are still stored in the factory. The committee is responsible for the disposal methods. After the liquidation is completed, all employees will be transferred to Nanjing for employment in the new factory. As for the existing factory site, it still needs to wait for the Ministry's order to handle it.</p>

<h3>The Anti-War Association Telegraphed Zhang Boling Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Visit Han Fuju Again for Peace</p>
<p>The head office of the League for the Cessation of Civil War previously received a telegram from representative Zhang Boling stating that Han Fuju had stopped military actions and was awaiting a central government solution. Zhang immediately hosted people from all walks of life in Jinan to form a branch, and then went to Qingdao to form a branch. The Anti-War Association heard that Zhang had returned to Jinan from Qingdao and sent another telegram yesterday, saying: "Jinan Chamber of Commerce urgently forwards to Mr. Zhang Boling: We heard that you returned to Jinan from Qingdao. We hope you will visit Chairman Han again to maintain peace and seek solutions to avoid further misfortune. Sincerely, the Head Office of the League for the Cessation of Civil War, signed."</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Telegraphed Sichuan Generals to Cease Fighting</h3>
<p>Not Only Will Sichuanese People Suffer, But International Relations Will Be Affected</p>
<p>Any Disputes Should Be Handled by the Central Government</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: It has been rumored in recent days that Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui in Sichuan are at odds, and that they have already made contact near Chengdu. Central Committee Member Zhang Qun is concerned about Sichuan affairs and telegraphed Sichuan generals yesterday, explaining the advantages and disadvantages in order to quell the crisis and maintain the overall situation. The original telegram is recorded below: "Urgent. To Director Liu Fucheng of Chongqing, General Yang Zihui of Guang'an, Chairman Liu Zigan of Chengdu, General Deng Jinkang, and General Tian Songyao: Recently, there have been rumors in Sichuan, some saying that Chengdu will attack Chongqing, or Chongqing will attack Chengdu, or that the northern road has other plans to use force. The rumors are numerous and contradictory, but I am worried. Since the September 18th Incident, the Chinese people have been seeking unity against foreign aggression, and the international community has also focused its attention on China. Domestic disputes in recent years have already caused great pain among those who know the situation. If further disputes arise, not only will the Sichuanese people suffer, and the situation in Sichuan will not improve, but also, with the increasing external threats, it will have a major impact internationally. Thinking of the future, I am deeply worried. I believe that you all love the country and Sichuan, and you have long been aware of this. Some troublemakers may be trying to sell their tricks, creating rumors to stir up political waves. If you are not careful and fall into their trap, you will harm yourselves and the country. What will people say? I am a Sichuanese and share the same love for my hometown and country as you. I feel worried, so I must tell you. Please consider the overall situation, quell the crisis, make a joint statement to show the people of the country your great faith. If you have any disputes, you should report them to the central government for impartial handling. You must not act rashly and cause trouble. I am sending this telegram to express my sincerity. I hope you will understand. Zhang Qun, signed."</p>
<h3>The Anti-War Association Pays Attention to the Situation in Sichuan</h3>
<p>Divided Telegrams for Investigation Two Weeks Ago</p>
<p>A Reply Telegram from Liu Wenhui Has Now Been Received</p>
<p>The head office of the League for the Cessation of Civil War previously discussed the rumors of discord between Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui in Sichuan at the second standing committee meeting on the 12th of last month. It was decided to send telegrams to the Chongqing and Chengdu Chambers of Commerce, asking them to investigate the troop movements and deployments of both sides and to find ways to resolve the situation. Since no reply was received after a week, the third standing committee meeting on the 19th was held to discuss and prepare preventive measures. At the fourth meeting on the 23rd, it was decided to send telegrams to Liu Wenhui in Chengdu and Liu Xiang in Chongqing to inquire and ask them to reply by telegram to reassure the people. At the same time, telegrams were sent to urge the Chengdu and Chongqing Chambers of Commerce to reply quickly. On the 28th, a reply telegram from Liu Wenhui in Chengdu and a telegram from the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce were received. It is now heard that the association has sent another telegram to Liu Xiang asking for a reply. The various telegrams are recorded below: Telegram to the Chengdu and Chongqing Chambers of Commerce: "To the Chengdu and Chongqing Chambers of Commerce and all legal entities: There are rumors here that the troops of Chengdu and Chongqing are being mobilized and deployed. This association is deeply concerned about this situation, which is within the scope of our duties. We urgently hope that your associations and all legal entities will conduct a detailed investigation and inform us by express mail. At a time when foreign aggression is urgent, how can we tolerate internal strife? If something does happen, you should find ways to resolve it and provide us with your opinions so that we can work with all sectors of your province to prepare for the worst. We send this telegram to you and await your reply. The Head Office of the League for the Cessation of Civil War, signed." (Sent on September 12th)</p>
<p>Another Telegram to the Chengdu and Chongqing Chambers of Commerce: "To the Chengdu and Chongqing Chambers of Commerce: The telegram was sent a few days ago. We hope for a prompt reply. The Head Office of the League for the Cessation of Civil War, signed." (Sent on September 23rd)</p>
<p>Telegrams to Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui: "To Chairman Liu of the Chengdu Provincial Government and Director Liu of Chongqing: In recent days, Sichuanese people in Shanghai have come to our association to request that the troops of Chengdu and Chongqing are being mobilized and that unfortunate events may occur. They hope that measures will be taken to resolve the situation. At a time of national crisis, we cannot tolerate internal strife and become a laughing stock to foreigners. You are both respected and have foresight, so you must understand this. Our association believes that these rumors are not true, but we are concerned about the opinions of the public and do not want your reputation to be harmed. We dare to ask you to reply by telegram quickly to reassure the people. We send this telegram in addition to the telegram to Director Liu. The Head Office of the League for the Cessation of Civil War, signed." (Sent on September 23rd)</p>
<p>Reply Telegram from the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce: "To the Head Office of the League for the Cessation of Civil War in Shanghai: We have received your telegram and deeply admire your concern for the situation in Sichuan. The movement of troops in Sichuan is difficult to conceal, but the truth of the matter has not been revealed. Our association has forwarded your letter to the relevant authorities, legal entities, and newspapers and attached our opinions to fulfill our responsibility to resolve the situation. The original document is attached for your review. We will continue to report on the situation and hope that you will provide us with guidance. Sincerely, the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce." (Received on September 28th)</p>
<p>Public Telegram from the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce: "To General Liu of Chongqing, General Liu of Chengdu, General Deng, General Tian of Santai, General Yang of Guang'an, Director Liu of Suiding, Commander Li of Suining, all division and brigade commanders, legal entities, and newspapers: We have received a telegram from the Head Office of the League for the Cessation of Civil War, which reads (same as above). In recent years, floods and bandits have spread across the country, and the Japanese invaders have occupied the Northeast. Internal and external troubles are concentrated at one time. Therefore, the cessation of civil war is the most important task at present. All military generals are comrades. At this time of national crisis, we should release our suspicions and resist foreign aggression, not engage in infighting. Please understand this. In recent days, there have been reports of troop deployments from various parties, but the truth is unknown. However, the news has spread far and wide, even to Shanghai. How can we, the people of Sichuan, remain indifferent? We hope that the reports are false and that we will not be accused of making baseless speculations. If the reports are true, there will be a disaster. At this time of crisis, the people of all sectors can only adhere to the spirit of the anti-civil war movement, unite and passively resist. To any party, we will refuse to comply with any demands other than regular taxes, because the people's resources have been exhausted. This is also a sincere effort to promote peace and overcome national difficulties. We know that justice is on our side and we will gain the sympathy of the majority and the understanding of all parties. We only seek to eliminate the disaster and are willing to tell you with tears. We hope that the officials will express their views frankly to dispel the doubts of the public. The people of all sectors should also work hard to unite and save the situation. We express our sincere feelings and await your instructions. Sincerely, the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce, signed."</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui of Chengdu Sent a Telegram to the Anti-War Association: "To all the gentlemen of the League for the Cessation of Civil War: We have received your telegram and admire your words of kindness. At a time of national crisis, we should all share our concerns and work together to overcome danger and resist foreign aggression. We cannot bear to speak of internal strife. Wenhui is working to mediate and compromise. This has always been my intention, and God knows it. Although there have been rumors recently, Wenhui's commitment to peace is unwavering. I hope that these rumors are just false accusations and that this unfortunate event will not occur. Even if people do not understand me, I will try my best to avoid it. As long as it is possible to compromise and turn hostility into harmony, I will never start a war and become a leader of the rebels. I will not disappoint your expectations. I respect your good advice and hope you will understand. Liu Wenhui, signed."</p>
<p>The Anti-War Association Sent Another Telegram to Liu Xiang Urging for a Reply: "To Director Liu of Chongqing: We trust that you have received the previous telegram. Please reply quickly to reassure the people. The Head Office of the League for the Cessation of Civil War, signed."</p>
<h3>War Report from the Fourth Route of the National Salvation Army</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Support Association for the Northeastern Volunteer Army received an official letter from Cheng Changkui, Commander of the Fourth Route Cavalry of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, sent from Rehe, saying, "We are writing to inform you that our department previously sent representatives Huang Zhendong and others to Shanghai to seek assistance. We are very grateful for your full support. Kui was recommended by the Beijing National Salvation Association to concurrently serve as the Commander of the Fourth Route Cavalry of the Northeastern People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army. We immediately led troops from Ping to the defense. Now we have arrived in Rehe. We plan to concentrate the supporting troops in that area and advance to [omitted] to prepare for a general attack. The First Detachment under the jurisdiction of this route has already occupied Liaoyuan. The Liu Zhan unit of the First Detachment is now a reserve force, advancing with the headquarters. The Li Juchuan unit of the Third Detachment is attacking north of [omitted]. The Han Lingge unit of the Fourth Detachment is advancing east of [omitted]. The Zhao Wenxian unit of the Fifth Detachment is attacking east of [omitted]. The Lao Heping unit is concentrated west of [omitted] awaiting orders. The Wu Zongyu commando has left [omitted] and is attacking [omitted]. According to statistics, this route has more than 18,000 people and about 70% have guns. The current military strength has actually expanded compared to the previous Mongolian Border Cavalry First Detachment. The military region has been changed and is now under the command of Peng Xiaoqiu of the First Military Region, but the goal of resisting Japan remains the same. All reasons for Kui's concurrent position as Commander of the Fourth Route Cavalry of the Northeastern People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, as well as the history of the military region and the current deployment of troops, are reported to your association for your reference. We hope to continue to receive support in the future."</p>
<h3>Liu Zongyao, Representative of the Northeastern Volunteer Army, Returned North Last Night</h3>
<p>According to the China Eastern News Agency, Liu Zongyao, representative of the Twenty-Sixth Route of the Northeastern People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, returned to the defense last night at the summons of Zhang Mingwu, commander of the route, to participate in important meetings.</p>
<p>Conversation According to what he told the China Eastern News Agency reporter before his departure, the 26th Route and the Wang Xianting and Geng Jizhou troops have now formed a line, advancing from Tiger Mountain and Yixian County. When the guard company and the broadsword team of the Fourth Detachment encountered the enemy, they killed dozens and captured many weapons. The various routes are encircling the Jinzhou Station and are already in contact.</p>
<p>Declaration Liu Zongyao issued a declaration yesterday, saying: "To all levels of the Kuomintang, all people's organizations, all institutions, all schools, all newspapers, all army division, brigade commanders, all soldiers, and all compatriots: Our Central Plains is in ruins, the people are suffering, and internal strife is frequent. The situation is hopeless. The overall situation is one of temporary peace, but the Japanese are taking advantage of our disasters to invade our country, slaughter our compatriots, and implement their Korean policy to realize their Manchuria-Mongolia policy. They have occupied Liaoning and Heilongjiang, and are again invading Tianjin and Beijing. The Northeast has fallen, Shanghai has suffered a tragic defeat, and now they are invading Rehe and planning to attack North China. They are determined to destroy our China. Tens of millions of compatriots are crying out for help, awaiting death with their hands tied, suffering countless tortures and deaths, displaced and with no way to return. The country has not yet perished, but the knife is already at our throats. They are still harboring evil intentions, advancing step by step, invading and plundering, using every means possible. However, any Chinese person with loyalty and righteousness cannot but feel heartbroken. Now that the building is about to collapse, one pillar cannot support it. To preserve our nation and the livelihood of our people, we must dedicate ourselves to resisting the enemy, be of one mind and one heart, provide assistance and funds, unite our spirits, and work together to save the sinking ship. We hope that all people in the country will wake up quickly, work hard to unite, and no longer hesitate. All Chinese patriots, national defenders, wherever they are, regardless of who is being attacked, must hold the idea that there are no boundaries. The survival of the country depends on the last drop of blood. Loyal and righteous compatriots, wake up and rise up, pool our resources and efforts, and urgently seek to save the situation. We express our sincerity and await your instructions. Liu Zongyao, Representative for Assistance of the Twenty-Sixth Route of the Northeastern People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army."</p>

<h3>The Continental Daily Reports a Conversation with Sakonji</h3>
<p>The Japanese Consul General Sends a Letter to the Newspaper to Correct the Record</p>
<p>The English-language Continental Daily reported on the 28th that Japanese Naval Commander Sakonji had made a statement at a reception for Japanese reporters on the 24th of this month, saying that "a war between Japan and the United States is inevitable." At 2:00 p.m. on the 28th, Japanese Consul General Ishisha sent a letter to the Continental Daily requesting a correction. The original letter stated: "We are writing to inform you that your newspaper carried an article on the morning of the 28th entitled 'Lieutenant General Sakonji Declares that a War between Japan and the United States is Inevitable; Japan is Adequately Prepared.' After investigation, all the allegations are fabricated. Commander Sakonji did host a reception for Japanese reporters on the 24th of this month, but the content of the conversation was as follows: 'The Shanghai Incident this time was caused by misunderstandings and accumulated resentment between the two countries. It is very regrettable. Fortunately, the incident has come to an end. I sincerely hope that both countries will think deeply and carefully and not cause any more unfortunate incidents. The main purpose of the Japanese defense forces is to maintain peace. Military preparations should not be overemphasized, but they should not be ignored. The navy under my command in Shanghai is adhering to this purpose and will continue to do so. Leaders of the press, as manufacturers of public opinion, should sympathize with our position and contribute to the consolidation of peace in the Far East.' From this point of view, all the allegations in your newspaper are inconsistent with the facts and are extremely dangerous. We hope that your newspaper will make a correction."</p>

<h3>General Contributions to the Northeast Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>The Thrifty Efforts of the Jin Yun Factory: The Shanghai Municipal Electrical and Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association members, specifically the entire staff of the Jin Yun Silk Weaving Factory on Zhaofeng Road, recognizing the Northeast Volunteer Army's brave fight against the enemy and their contribution to the Party and the nation, initiated a food and clothing reduction campaign led by the factory manager, Mr. Wang Shiqiang, to accumulate funds for donating to the Northeast Volunteer Army. Currently, they have raised 500 silver dollars, which have been handed over to the Shanghai Bank for transfer to the front lines, as a small contribution to the brave soldiers fighting the enemy.</p>
<p>The Double Tenth Festival Pay of the Da Hua Factory: Since Mr. Gao Songfu took over as manager of the Da Hua Match Factory, he has been working hard to reorganize it. In the past three years, the factory's output has gradually increased. The factory's employees, deeply ashamed of the national humiliation since the January 28th Incident, expressed this sentiment during the factory affairs meeting in September to all the workers. Everyone was indignant. On the Double Tenth Festival, all factories stopped work for rest, and wages were paid as usual. The factory's workers voluntarily worked as usual, with double wages, and donated the extra amount to the Northeast to fulfill the duty of a citizen. All staff members contributed one day's salary from the Double Tenth Festival as a donation, estimated to be over 100 yuan. The exact amount will be announced after it is confirmed on that day. There is no shortage of enthusiastic gentlemen in the domestic industrial sector, and they will surely rise to the occasion upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>Fujian Education Department Continues to Donate 1,000 Yuan: To donate to the Northeast Volunteer Army, the Fujian Education Department had previously donated 4,000 yuan in two installments to the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association. Yesterday, the department sent another 1,000 yuan, representing donations from the educational sector in Fujian Province.</p>
<h3>National Music Society Performance to Raise Funds for Disaster Relief, Third Day</h3>

The performed dramas included "Regret at the End of the Ming Dynasty," "White Gate Tower," "Yan Yang Tower," and "Meeting of Heroes," etc., lasting until 2 a.m. The society's representatives expressed gratitude to the audience on behalf of the Northeast refugees. In total, over 2,000 tickets were sold over the three days. All expenses were borne by the initiators, so that the proceeds from the tickets could truly benefit the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>North China Representatives of the Aviation Construction Association Depart from Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese Aviation Construction Association began soliciting members, letters requesting membership and inquiries about establishing branches have been received from various provinces every day. The association held a regular meeting at the Continental Arcade on Nanjing Road yesterday. For investigation purposes, the association has appointed its design director, Zhu Lin, to promote the association in the Pingjin area and to connect with the association's directors in Ping, Xiong Bing San and Zhu Zi Qiao to develop plans for association affairs. The association also appointed its executive director, Yan Zhifang, to contact leaders from all walks of life in important cities such as Qingdao, Jinan, and Taiyuan, in order to awaken the people of North China, who are on the front lines of the anti-Japanese resistance, to work together to build aviation, to strengthen national defense, and to relieve national suffering. It is reported that Mr. Zhu and Mr. Yan left Shanghai this morning to travel to various provinces in North China.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Villagers Enclosed by Two Railways Petitioned the Railway Department in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to build new station sites, the Two Railways Bureau has designated villagers' houses and farmlands along the routes as construction zones. Among them are villagers from Wangjiajing, Zhangjiazhai, and Zhuxiang in Pengpu District. The bureau only needs 700 mu of land, but the area designated for enclosure is as much as 4,000 mu. Therefore, they petitioned the Railway Bureau, requesting that the villages of Wangjiajing, etc., not be included in the railway area. However, repeated petitions to Director Chen Xinghan were ineffective. Last night, six representatives, Hou Xuanqing, Hou Baocheng, Zhang Lingen, Tan Zhongsheng, Tao Wenyuan, and Tao Ailang, elected by the three villages, took the 11 p.m. express train to Beijing to petition Railway Minister Gu Mengyu, requesting exemption from enclosure to alleviate the people's hardships.</p>
<h3>Oath of Office for Executive and Supervisory Committee Members of the Municipal Party Headquarters and District Party Headquarters</h3>

It is reported that the new executive and supervisory committee members will hold a joint swearing-in ceremony at 10 a.m. today in the auditorium on the third floor of the municipal party headquarters.

<h3>Mr. Wang Boqun's Talk After Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Sichuan Province is Vast, Resourceful, and Its People are Hardworking and Enduring</p>
<p>The Most Important Plan at Present Should Be to Build Railways</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Boqun, former Minister of Communications, was ordered by the National Government to inspect the three provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. He has now returned to Shanghai. A reporter visited him at his residence and first asked about the results of his observations in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. Mr. Wang said, "I was ordered to inspect the three provinces, and because of the convenience of the journey, I first entered Sichuan Province. I spent more than two months in Sichuan and learned about its complex situation. I must first return to Nanjing to report, so I have not yet gone to Yunnan and Guizhou. I have traveled to almost all the important cities in Sichuan Province, and I have talked with officials and representatives of various organizations. I feel that the land is vast and resourceful, and there is everything needed for daily life. The people are hardworking and enduring, surpassing the rest of the country. However, the inconvenient transportation makes it impossible to break away from the handicraft era, and goods are abandoned on the ground, which is a great pity. Therefore, the most important plan at present is to build railways, which is the mother of all development. The total number of soldiers in Sichuan is more than 400,000, and the annual cost is about 100 million yuan. There is a so-called defense zone system, in which one leader controls tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of soldiers, occupying a place and confronting each other, which is an obstacle to all unified facilities, and there is always the possibility of causing internal strife. This time, I met with the leaders and urged them to unite sincerely, work hard to develop, improve internal affairs, cultivate strength, and jointly face the national crisis. The leaders all expressed their agreement, realizing that too many soldiers and too much military spending would overwhelm the people, not only would they not be able to serve the country, but they themselves would also feel great difficulty." The reporter also asked Mr. Wang whether he had heard anything about the opium smuggling case on the Yongnian steamboat, which he had just taken eastward. Mr. Wang said, "I heard that the Yongnian ship is the fastest, and there is no need to transfer along the way, so I took it. Because I had to meet with Chairman Jiang in Hankou, I planned to disembark in Hankou. I originally brought six attendants, but they were stranded in Chengdu due to illness, so only four people traveled with me. The luggage was very simple. The Yongnian ship sailed directly from Chongqing to Shanghai, with thousands of passengers. There was almost no space on the deck. Eight days after departure, I heard that there was a trend of smuggling opium. I then gathered my attendants and warned the public officials to be honest and law-abiding, and not to carry prohibited items privately, and ordered them to pay special attention to the servants and other people, and to place the luggage separately. Whenever customs officials came, they should be allowed to inspect first. We stayed in Wanxian that day and followed these instructions. On the 9th, we arrived in Yichang. When I saw the customs officials arriving, I told them again to be sure to check everything and not to be lenient. As a result, hundreds of taels of smuggled opium were found in the luggage of a female passenger in the official cabin. On the 11th, we arrived in Hankou. Old colleagues from the transportation department and Commander Ye of the garrison came to meet us on the ship or on the shore. I then led my attendants and luggage to disembark after inspection. Unexpectedly, after I disembarked, the ship was searched and opium and morphine were found, and Mrs. Shuang, who was on the same ship, was also suspected of serious crimes, which was completely unexpected. The next day, I met with Chairman Jiang and requested that the matter be thoroughly investigated and dealt with severely, and it will soon come to light."</p>
<h3>Second Day of the Chinese Medical Association Conference</h3>
<p>The Chinese Medical Association continued to hold its conference at the Lister Institute yesterday. From 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., association affairs were discussed, chaired by Dr. Liu Ruiheng, with Dr. Zhuo Bi Men and Dr. Yu Yun as recorders. The first items discussed were the reports of the Publishing Committee and the National Medical Affairs Committee. After a brief discussion, they were accepted by all members. Then, Drs. Maston and Goarson suggested shortening the length of medical courses in order to train more doctors, but because it concerned medical education, it should be reviewed in detail by the Medical Education Committee and then submitted to the general meeting for discussion. After the business meeting, a general surgery meeting was held, attended by nearly 400 people. The program was: (1) Acute appendicitis, Dr. Tang's discussion of embryology, anatomy, and symptoms, Dr. Shi's discussion of treatment, and Dr. Chen's discussion of postoperative treatment; (2) Film screening, hand infections. At 12 p.m., a group photo was taken. In the afternoon, group meetings were held. At 4 p.m., Dr. Niu Huisheng, director of the Orthopedic Hospital, arranged for many cars to visit the hospital on Xujiahui Road. The buildings were magnificent and the equipment was comprehensive. All the visitors were very satisfied. Dr. Niu and his wife cordially entertained them with tea and refreshments. The hosts and guests parted happily after 6 p.m.</p>
<h3>The Pudong Telephone Problem Was Inquired About Yesterday</h3>
<p>Statement by the Telephone Company Authorities</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company's submarine cable connecting Pudong was damaged, causing users' calls to be temporarily suspended, which is very inconvenient. According to the company's authorities yesterday, the Shanghai Telephone Company has always taken convenience to the public as its service tenet. The news reported that the company had no intention of signing a new contract, which is not entirely true. Because the Shanghai Telephone Company operates a public utility, when it obtained the franchise from the Municipal Council, the two parties signed a contract stating that any contract the company signs with any party must be approved by the Municipal Council to be official. However, since the provisional contract draft was jointly signed by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau last winter, the Municipal Council has not yet approved it. Therefore, the company cannot make any progress. As for the current urgent desire to repair the Pujiang cable, it is entirely for the convenience of users. The laying of this cable has been going on for a long time, and it is very important for communication. Once it is interrupted, the impact on users is significant. Now, the company cannot carry out repairs and cannot help users.</p>
<h3>The Hua Wu Steamer Ran Aground in Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Bow Was Deeply Embedded in the Riverbank</p>
<p>A Steamer Was Sent to the Rescue Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The Hua Wu steamer of the Nanhua Company in Shanghai ran aground near Zhenjiang while transporting cargo from Nanjing to Shanghai. The front of the ship was completely grounded on the riverbank, and the situation was quite dangerous. The Shanghai office has sent a steamer to the rescue. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Transporting Coal to Shanghai: The Nanhua Shipping Company is run by Liu Shisun. It originally had four seagoing vessels. In recent years, the Hua Ping and Hua Yang have been sold, leaving only the Hua Wu to operate. This time, the ship went to Pukou to transport 6,800 tons of coal from the Zhongxing Coal Mine to Shanghai. It left Nanjing on Monday of this week. That night, the ship arrived in Zhenjiang, and due to fog, it ran aground. The ship's hull was trapped on the riverbank.</p>
<p>The Truth of the Grounding: The Hua Wu steamer has a deadweight of 7,000 tons. This time, it was loaded with 6,800 tons of coal, which was already overweight. On Monday night, the ship arrived at the Jinshan Temple on the upper reaches of Zhenjiang, and the weather suddenly changed, with heavy fog, making navigation difficult. At this time, if the river pilot was not careful, he would have turned the Hua Wu steamer sideways and ran it aground on the shoal on the riverbank. At that time, because of the heavy load and the rapid forward movement, the front half of the Hua Wu was grounded on the riverbank, and the lower half was still in the river, similar to the situation of the Zhaoshang Tonghua ship aground at Huangsangkou.</p>
<p>Unable to Escape Danger: After the ship ran aground, the shipowners initially tried to reverse the ship, but the coal inside the ship was all heavy cargo, and it was deeply trapped in the sand. Repeated reversing failed to move it even a bit, and instead made the ship more dangerous. At this point, shipowner Yang Honglin knew that it would not be easy to pull it out for a while, so he put down a small sampan and landed, took a train to Shanghai in Zhenjiang, reported to the head office, and discussed rescue methods.</p>
<p>Sending a Ship to Rescue: Yesterday, shipowner Yang arrived in Shanghai, reported the details of the accident to Liu Shisun, and agreed to send a powerful tugboat from Shanghai to Zhenjiang to tow it. It was agreed to ask Jardine Matheson to dispatch a large tugboat and bring a group of workers, led by shipowner Yang Honglin, to the opposite bank of Jinshan Temple yesterday afternoon to tow it. Whether it can be towed out immediately is still unknown, but according to reports, the front of the ship has been deeply embedded in the sand and mud, and the situation is quite dangerous. Whether it is damaged or not needs to be verified after it is towed out.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Defense Corps Restoration Plan</h3>
<p>Requesting the Municipal Government to Supplement Four Items of Equipment</p>
<p>Requiring an Expenditure of More Than 1,330,000 Yuan</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, the business of various agencies in the city was severely damaged and suffered great losses. The municipal government had previously issued a notice to its subordinate units, ordering them to separately formulate restoration and reorganization plans. Luo Jingyou, chairman of the Management Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Defense Corps, after receiving the order, immediately convened the committee members to discuss day and night, and completed the drafting of the corps' restoration plan a few days ago. Chairman Luo also submitted the plan to the municipal government yesterday, along with various budget charts. The original submission is recorded below: Presenting the request for the Municipal Defense Corps, which has been affected by the war, to be thoroughly reorganized to meet the needs. A restoration plan is respectfully submitted, hoping that it will be reviewed and approved, and that funds will be allocated for purchase and supplementation. I humbly observe that since the city has been affected by the January 28th War, the Municipal Government has issued notices to various bureaus, ordering them to formulate restoration plans separately within their respective areas of responsibility, and submit them for review, along with budget estimates. The Defense Corps is also under its jurisdiction and should follow suit. I humbly observe that the city's defense corps originated from the previous merchants' corps. It has a long history. Since the Xinhai Revolution and the Guichou Revolution and the Qi-Lu War, Shanghai has always been the first to bear the brunt. The local area is often in trouble. During these critical times, the militia has always made every effort. Moreover, as in the Xinhai Revolution, Chen Gongying used the power of the merchants' corps and finally achieved the restoration. These are all the past traces of the local defense corps, and it is not just about maintaining the local area. This time, the Japanese invaded Shanghai and the four borders were in turmoil. The entire Defense Corps was mobilized, without regard to dawn or dusk. Those in the war zone were naturally present, and those not in the war zone also did their best for the rear defense. In the end, the local area was able to live in peace. This is the credit of the military and police, but it is also due to the assistance of the militia. However, the city's Defense Corps has undergone this incident, and there are things that must be urgently restored and reorganized. I would like to list them clearly. I have found that at the beginning of the establishment of the district corps, the expenses were entirely reliant on the voluntary donations of local enthusiastic people, and there were no fixed funds. Therefore, the clothing, firearms, and other equipment were all simple and lacking. Since the Municipal Government took over, donations have been stopped. Although the city treasury has provided meager subsidies, it still feels extremely exhausted and unable to supplement. This time, the corps in the war zone have suffered almost complete losses, and the other district corps have also been affected, and most of them are nominally extinct. Looking around at the city's situation, the past and present are very different. In the future, the local security, in addition to the security team and the police, the Defense Corps has an unshirkable responsibility. The responsibility is as heavy as that, and the military strength is so decayed. If it is still not supplemented, how can it be worthy of the burden and expectations? Moreover, recently Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Hankou strongly advocated promoting the people's armed forces, and encouraged them by improving their treatment and increasing their powers. It is clear that the importance of the militia has long been recognized by the government. Your honor loves and protects the local defense corps in every possible way. Now, I would like to list the necessary supplements to the equipment of the city's Defense Corps as follows: (1) Supplementing firearms: I have found that the original firearms of the district corps are less than half in number, and many of them are unusable. Now, it is planned to fully supplement the missing rifles in addition to the available weapons and ammunition in each district corps, so that each member has one gun, and each gun is equipped with 500 rounds of ammunition. It is also planned to follow the example of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and add two portable machine guns to each team to strengthen its strength. (2) Supplementing civil engineering equipment: I have found that the Defense Corps is a people's armed force, and its military equipment does not necessarily have to be as good as the army's, but civil engineering equipment is an indispensable item for defense, and it cannot but have considerable preparations. Now, it is planned to set up one-third of each team to increase defensive power in times of emergency. (3) Supplementing vehicles and telescopes: I have found that the city area is vast. Except for the urban area, where transportation is relatively convenient, there are many obstacles in the rural areas. In the event of an accident, the equipment for communication, patrols, transportation, and reconnaissance is practically indispensable. Now, it is planned to supplement them selectively to make them more agile. (4) Supplementing clothing: I have found that the clothing of the district corps has not been entirely prepared, and has been incomplete and incomplete for many years. The losses this time have been particularly great. It is not enough to supplement them all to rectify the military appearance and provide services. As for kettles and lunch boxes, they are indispensable items in times of emergency, and it is planned to add them all together. For the above four items, the association has realistically estimated that a total of 1,337,156 yuan is required, which is a long-term solution. Shanghai is located in a strategic location, and is related to the views of China and foreign countries. Foreigners do not hesitate to spend huge sums of money to run the merchants' corps in the concession, and the completeness of their equipment is beyond our reach. In the future, the importance of the Municipal Defense Corps is as described above, and its strength should be vigorously supplemented so that it can fulfill its duties. I respectfully request that your honor consider transferring it to the Songhu District Police Rear Committee to allocate funds for purchase in order to strengthen its strength and secure the local area. Whether it is feasible, I have combined the books and tables and submitted a document requesting it. I respectfully request that you review and instruct its implementation, which is for the public convenience. I respectfully submit to Wu, Mayor of Shanghai, with five sheets of the restoration plan and one copy of the budget estimate.</p>
<h3>Ninth National Anti-Drug Campaign Week of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association</h3>
<p>Outline of Propaganda</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association will hold the ninth National Anti-Drug Campaign Week today, and has issued the following outline of propaganda. This year marks the ninth National Anti-Drug Campaign Week. The previous eight sessions, although also filled with the cries of poppy tears and blood, the most shocking is the one this week. (Omission) Now, on the occasion of the ninth National Anti-Drug Campaign Week, the association is considering the current situation and looking forward to the future, and is dazed and confused, as if suffering a heavy blow. It dares to offer its sincere heart and respectfully requests all sectors of society not to be disappointed in this intractable opium disaster and to stop ignoring it. It also hopes that the government authorities can suddenly realize the conspiracy of the powerful enemy and their past mistakes, and resolutely awaken, strictly implement the opium ban, and implement the following smoking ban plans: (1) Find alternative sources of tax revenue and do not use opium public sales as a measure to quench thirst with poison. (2) Issue a general order to the military and political authorities of all provinces prohibiting them from forcing farmers to grow opium. (3) The prohibition of opium should be based on the principle of pure prohibition. (4) Earmark fines for the prohibition of opium to fund the prohibition of opium and anti-drug work. (5) The government's prohibition of opium should cooperate with the people. (6) If you want to strictly prohibit opium, you must first punish illegal officials. (7) Conduct a major investigation of the opium disaster, with the people responsible. (8) Designate the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Henan as model areas for the prohibition of opium. (9) Strictly manage and control narcotics. (10) Pay attention to the selection of people responsible for handling opium prohibition agencies. (11) Hire international experts and adopt good practices from various countries. The above-mentioned measures require the implementation of the government, and must rely on the supervision of the people. All compatriots must work together with the association to unite and shout, otherwise, only the association will be left to bear its weight, how can it not be destroyed, and the breath of the anti-drug movement will probably be silent for a long time. I hope all sectors of society will think deeply and provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Xiang Sheng Iron Factory Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>Both Parties Signed Ten Conditions</p>
<p>It Was Decided to Start Work on October 3</p>
<p>The Social Bureau summoned both parties yesterday to mediate the labor dispute at the Xiang Sheng Iron Factory in Pudong. As a result, ten conditions were signed and the resolution was announced. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mediation Situation: The Social Bureau summoned both labor and management parties at 2 p.m. yesterday to mediate. The labor representatives were Zhang Linhua, Lu Lianqing, Yi Chang, and Xia Zhenru, and the management representatives were Bao Naimen and Hamilton, with Gong Honggeng as the translator. The Municipal Party Headquarters was represented by Li Weixiong. Wang Gang, a staff member of the Third Section of the Social Bureau, chaired the meeting. First, the chairman announced that the case had been held for a long time, and the workers' lives were quite panic-stricken. He hoped that both parties would make concessions to resolve the issue. Then, the labor and management parties reported the direct negotiation process. Finally, they discussed the issues of the factory's resumption of work and the dismissal of workers for a long time. Finally, ten conditions for resolution were drafted. Both parties expressed their agreement and signed on the spot, announcing the resolution.</p>
<p>Conditions for Resolution: The labor and management parties signed ten conditions for resolution as follows: (1) The factory will resume work on October 3. (2) Of the 124 workers who regularly receive work permits but do not work in the factory, 15 will be reinstated, and the remaining 109 will be dismissed. Whether the remaining 10 of the 109 dismissed workers can be reinstated will be negotiated by the union and the factory. (3) 26 workers who have been absent from work for a long time will be allowed to be dismissed. (4) The numbers of the workers reinstated and dismissed in the second and third articles can be found in the list prepared by the factory, which will be signed by representatives of the party and government agencies and stored in the Social Bureau. (5) The factory will subsidize the workers' losses with 1,200 yuan. (6) All the unskilled workers will be issued permits. If the work is light, they will be allowed to work in shifts. There must be at least 73 people working every day (including Sundays). (7) The factory will change the daily wages of unskilled workers from a uniform 67 cents to 1.20 yuan, 1.80 yuan, and 67.5 cents, depending on their working ability. (8) The daily wages of unskilled workers No. 1 and No. 2 will be set at 1.20 yuan, and the daily wage of unskilled workers No. 3 will be 1.50 yuan. (9) The treatment of unskilled workers working night shifts will be the same as that of lathe workers, etc. (10) In the future, if the factory finds that a worker is not working in the factory during roll call, it must notify the respective foremen and the union of the number of the absent worker after 12:00 a.m. and before 5:00 p.m. on the same day, and post it in a conspicuous place. This article was agreed upon and signed by the representatives of both parties, and the mediation is established as a labor contract between the parties in dispute.</p>
<h3>The Dispute Over Shanghai South Public Buses Is Not Over</h3>
<p>Two Female Workers Continue Their Hunger Strike</p>
<p>Workers' Union Organizes a Donation Team to Raise Funds</p>
<p>The shutdown dispute of the Shanghai South Public Bus Company has been mediated by the party and government many times, but it has not been resolved. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Continuing the Hunger Strike: Ms. Xu Lie'e and Ms. Hou Tingfen, two female ticket sellers, declared a hunger strike after entering the factory the day before, because they were concerned about the difficulty of making a living and the fact that the dispute would not be easily resolved in a short time. Afterwards, Fan Guoren, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, personally went to the factory to persuade them to eat, but the female workers were determined and continued their hunger strike.</p>
<p>Joining of Various Departments: All the workers in the company's various departments, including ticket sellers, ticket writers, ticket inspectors, drivers, water fillers, coppersmiths, blacksmiths, carpenters, electricians, car washers, and car arrangers, etc., totaling more than ten departments, together with the fourth branch station in West Shanghai, Hongqiao, and Caojiadu, etc., a total of more than 180 people. When the company announced the suspension of business last month, in addition to the more than 80 workers from the ticket selling, ticket writing, ticket inspection, driving, and water filling departments who unanimously negotiated with the company, the workers from the copper, iron, electric, and wood departments, etc., all took a wait-and-see attitude. Now, the workers from the copper department, etc., seeing that the company's dispute is unlikely to be resolved, especially yesterday, representatives from the various departments, Liu Xingsheng, Zhang Ayou, and Zhu Chengxiu, etc., led all the workers from the various departments to join in, taking a unified action.</p>
<p>Fundraising by District: After all the workers were suspended by the company, they had no work and no income was interrupted. Especially during the serious period of the dispute, they felt economically difficult. They organized a fundraising team to appeal to various unions for practical assistance. It is planned to divide into teams and depart to fundraise in six districts: South Shanghai, the French Concession, Zhabei, the Public Concession, Pudong, East Shanghai, and West Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Dispute Arose from Robbery</p>
<p>The Corpse Was Examined Yesterday</p>
<p>It was reported in yesterday's news that around 8 PM the night before, a man in a white cloth short shirt stabbed another man to death on Ningbo Road, and the assailant was arrested on the spot. It is now known that the assailant was a Shaoxing native named Wang Jinting, 34 years old, who set up a fruit stall at the entrance of Deshun Lane on Tianjin Road. The deceased was a first-class thug from Ningbo named Yue Menhai, 25 years old. On that day, Yue tried to extort money from Wang but failed. He forcibly snatched forty cents in small silver coins and thirty copper coins to escape. At that moment, Wang was extremely angry and stabbed him to death in the alley between the New Guangda Theater and the China Hotel. Subsequently, the Laozha Police Station ordered detectives to transport the deceased's body to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road and took the assailant back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they reported to the First Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Zhang Yaoguang to go to the office with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi to examine the body, ascended to the official seat and listened to the West Deputy Chief of the police station reported the circumstances at the time. Afterwards, the deceased's relative, Hu Ashui, claimed to be 48 years old, working as a cook in Datong Lane on Baike Road, and stated that the deceased was his wife's younger brother, whose family members all currently live in their hometown. Therefore, he was there to collect the body on their behalf. After obtaining the statement, Mr. Zhang ruled that the deceased Yue Menhai, male, was indeed stabbed to death before his death. The body was collected by his relative, Hu Ashui, who signed a guarantee for its burial. The assailant Wang Jinting was escorted by the police station to the Criminal Division of the Special Court, where Presiding Judge Feng Shide interrogated the defendant and ordered him to be detained for further review at a later date.</p>
<h3>Two Letters Beside a Headless Male Corpse</h3>
<p>Significantly Related to the Case</p>
<p>On the 25th of this month, a headless male corpse was discovered on Lincoln Road in western Shanghai. After a detailed examination by officials from the District Court, the head has not yet been found. The Sixth District Police Station, considering the bizarre nature of this case, immediately ordered an investigation. They discovered two letters beside the deceased, sent by Tan Liu from Jiangbei to Gu Defa, to be forwarded to Liu Jinsheng. The language within was incomprehensible and clearly related to the case. It was also discovered that Gu Defa is the same person as Gu Laosi, residing at No. 48, Gujia Lane, Zhoujiaqiao. The police were immediately dispatched to arrest him, but Gu had already fled. His wife, Gu Zhou, was detained. After questioning yielded no clues, she was handed over to the District Court yesterday for investigation.</p>
<h3>Arsenal Worker Unemployed and Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Xu Zhaofa, a 23-year-old man from Gaoyou, residing at No. 146, Jiangbian Pier, Gaochang Temple, had been working at the arsenal. Due to the arsenal being ordered to close down, Xu became unemployed. Since the Great War, there have been many unemployed people in Shanghai, causing Xu to be unable to find work, leading to financial difficulties. Resentful of his poverty, he hanged himself in his room the night before. It was not until his wife, Xu Wu, discovered and tried to rescue him that it was already too late. She cried loudly, which was heard by the Gaochang Temple Police Station in the Second District. They immediately ordered the local leader to report to the District Court for an examination. The deceased's wife also petitioned the court to waive the examination.</p>
<h3>The Qitai Steamer Catches Fire at the Wharf</h3>
<p>Four Sailors Injured</p>
<p>The Qitai steamer of the Shanghai Jiejiang Company, arriving in Shanghai from Yichang, had some damage to its engine and was taken out of service for repairs. The steamer was berthed at the Zhaoshangju Central Wharf and requested the New Factory to send technicians and workers to repair the machinery. Yesterday at 5:35 PM, the lubricating oil in the engine room of the Qitai steamer, which used diesel fuel, suddenly exploded due to cold air entering the engine, causing a fire to spread. The chief engineer, Shen Ruichang, 39 years old, from Ningbo, was burned, his entire body charred black, and his life was in danger. The third engineer, Chen Zongxing, 26 years old, from Ningbo, was burned all over his body. The lower-level worker, Fan Agou, 35 years old, from Ningbo, and Li Changlin, 28 years old, also from Ningbo, were all burned all over their bodies. After the incident, the injured were immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, and the police were notified to extinguish the fire on the ship. The hull of the ship was not severely damaged, but the four injured are in critical condition, with concerns for their lives.</p>

<h3>News from the Temporary Office of the Wharf Workers' Representatives</h3>
<p>Welcoming the Petition Group Back to Shanghai</p>
<p>Calling for the Release of Detained Fellow Workers</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Temporary Office of the Wharf Workers' Representatives has been working extremely hard, such as submitting petitions to the central government for registration, dispatching representatives to Beijing to petition, and planning to counter illegal organizations by contractors. Efforts have been made continuously in recent days. It is now known that the petition group has achieved satisfactory results in Beijing and will return to Shanghai soon. Therefore, the association has decided to hold a grand welcome meeting upon the group's return to Shanghai to express their gratitude and discuss future work guidelines. In addition, because the seven fellow workers who were previously arrested innocently are still detained in the Public Security Bureau, although the Central Standing Committee has already telegraphed the local party and government organs to release them, the local authorities have not yet complied. It is now reported that the office has requested the authorities to release them. If this goal is not achieved, they will launch a large-scale petition.</p>

<h3>American Sailor Creates Trouble While Drunk</h3>
<p>Turned Over to the American Consulate for Investigation</p>
<p>Sailor Nichols (transliteration) from the American warship "U.S.S. Rochester" was heavily drunk at 1:30 AM yesterday. He hired sampan No. 1014, belonging to Wang Ashou, at the Yangjingbang Bund pier to take him to the American warship on the opposite bank. The American sailor jumped onto the sampan and drove Wang Ashou ashore, taking control of the boat and rowing it into the river. Wang Ashou immediately invited his son, Wang Yutang, to chase after him in another boat. Unexpectedly, the American sailor Nichols used an oar to strike Wang Ashou's right arm and Wang Yutang's left arm. The father and son were injured and cried out for help in extreme pain. Patrol officer Lü Zhongyu, who was on duty with the Water Patrol Team, heard the cries and went to rescue them. Because it was dark, Officer Lü shone a flashlight on the American sailor. The American sailor, feeling guilty, jumped into the river and tried to swim away. Officer Lü managed to pull him out of the water and took him to the team along with Wang Ashou and his son. After Captain Zhu interrogated them, he learned that the foreign sailor had caused trouble while drunk and assaulted the boatmen. He immediately sent them to the Third Section of the General Bureau for investigation. Yesterday, Assistant Qu Sunyi of the Third Section contacted the American Consulate by telephone. American Consul Smers visited the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau and requested that the sailor be handed over to him to be taken back to the consulate for investigation. Assistant Qu stated to the American Consul that two boatmen had been assaulted by the sailor and requested that he be severely punished to prevent similar incidents from happening again. The American Consul agreed to deal with the matter according to the law. However, the sailor had no clothes on his upper body and was naked, which was a matter of dignity. The American Consul asked where the sailor's clothes were. It was said that he did not know after being drunk. The American Consul borrowed a shirt from Assistant Qu and had the sailor wear it before taking him back to the consulate for investigation.</p>

<h3>Xie Liheng Treats Dysentery Well</h3>
<p>In late autumn, dysentery is becoming more prevalent, often due to the lingering effects of heat and dampness from this summer, often presenting as both red and white dysentery, causing severe pain. He Zuowang of Xingye Bank and Lu Yaolin of Jing'an Villa both suffered severely from this condition and were treated and cured by Physician Xie Liheng of Meifuli, Pike Road. It is said that the treatment of dysentery starts with clearing and unblocking, then soothing and harmonizing, and finally clearing and transforming, all of which are effective. However, if opium is taken for temporary relief from the pain of dysentery, the turbid pathogens will be retained by the force of the opium and cannot be discharged smoothly, which will inevitably prolong the illness and lead to danger. Therefore, he always advises those suffering from dysentery not to take opium.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read a news item in your newspaper on the 29th of this month, in the "Local News" section, titled "Trial of the Taihe Street House Demolition Dispute." The news item stated that the defendant's witness, Fuluoyin, is Russian, and that on September 3rd at 4:00 PM, he came to collect items for the second time, which Yu Yabu reported to the General Inspectorate and the Yulin Road Police Station, and a Western policeman was dispatched to make him leave. It also stated that the plaintiff's lawyers, Cai Ni Pei, Yu Hualong, and Li Ming, requested to suspend the lease agreement signed by Chen Feng Company and Younigan. Judge Wang then ordered the bailiff to escort Zhang Ruitang to the Younigan Real Estate Department to take evidence. All of these statements are inconsistent with the facts. Our office has investigated that Luo Yin (transliteration) is British, not Russian. The Taihe Lane houses required necessary repairs, so after obtaining a permit from the Municipal Council, Mr. Fu, accompanied by the police, proceeded with the repairs. As for the statement that Judge Wang ordered the bailiff to escort Zhang Ruitang to our office to obtain evidence, it is even more untrue (remainder omitted). Letter from Lawyer Heckmond of Younigan Law Office, September 30th. I recently read a news item in your newspaper on the 29th of this month, in the "Local News" section, stating that Li Jisheng of Beichuan Sha is a foreigner, which does not correspond with the facts. According to investigation, Li Jisheng was extremely frugal in his childhood and wore discarded clothes abandoned by foreigners, and his eyes were like those of foreigners, so the villagers called him a foreigner, not because a foreigner gave him jewelry that he had this title. His family has only a hundred acres of meager land, which is barely enough to make a living, and he cannot be called a wealthy man. What your newspaper said must be based on inaccurate rumors. Please correct this mistake. Sincerely, Li Fengming, September 30th.</p>

<p>One or Two Words</p>
<h3>The Words of Negation in the Wu Dialect</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>When Suzhou people talk about an unsatisfactory person and negate them, they say "not good" if they want to be refined, and "not good" if they want to be vulgar. However, "not good" is not Suzhou dialect. If you use the soft language of Wu, there are various words of negation.</p>
<p>Suppose you bring up a person who is not welcome in Suzhou and deliberately ask the public:</p>
<p>Is so-and-so good?</p>
<p>Then! Suzhou people have various ways of expressing negation:</p>
<p>(1) So-and-so is "fu ling" (not effective/clever).</p>
<p>(2) So-and-so is "fu zhou" (not smooth/coordinated).</p>
<p>(3) So-and-so is "fu ru wei" (not flavorful/interesting).</p>
<p>(4) So-and-so is "fu ru diao" (not in tune/style).</p>
<p>These four kinds of negation all show that someone is not good; moreover, they are all very common words in Suzhou. You can say "fu ling," or you can say "fu zhou"; you can say "fu ru wei," or you can say "fu ru diao." If you study the origin of these various negations, saying "fu ling" is a negation from the witch doctor society; saying "fu zhou" is a negation from the machine weaving society; saying "fu ru wei" is a negation from the cook society; saying "fu ru diao" is a negation from the musician society. At first, these four kinds of sayings were all terms in each society, but later they became widespread, and everyone could say them to show that someone is not good.</p>
<p>However, when Wu people talk about a satisfactory person, they often say only one word "ling" or only one word "zhou," but they do not often say "ru wei" or "ru diao" alone. This is one difference. Moreover, "fu ling" and "fu zhou" can be said of all kinds of people; "fu ru wei" and "fu ru diao" are only applicable to criticize bad youths.</p>
<p>If an old man commits the faults of a bad youth, an "old" must be added to these two kinds of negations. Recently, an old painter in Wuzhong over sixty years old was sent to court for committing the crime of raping a young girl. In the places he passed through, Wu people often pointed at him like this:</p>
<p>Old "fu ru wei" Old "fu ru diao"</p>
<h3>Record of the Shooting Sun Terrace</h3>
<p>— Xu Siqiu</p>
<p>|Written in Opposition to Japan|</p>
<p>I have read the book Huainanzi. Hou Yi shot down the sun. It tells the story of the time of Emperor Yao, when ten suns appeared simultaneously, scorching the grass and trees. At that time, there was a king of the Youqiong State named Hou Yi, who was skilled in archery. Yao ordered him to shoot down the suns. He hit nine of them and left one. This is the origin of the "Shooting Sun."</p>
<p>Today, the violent suns are harming us, becoming more intense, even worse than the ancient ten suns appearing at the same time. Tens of thousands of square miles in the Northeast have been trampled all over. The blood of the Shanghai battle this spring has not yet dried, and recently, the news of alarm on the heated border has spread again. Although there are resistances from Ma Zhanshan, Ding Chao, Li Du, and various volunteer armies, their poisonous flames are fierce and have not been subdued. I hate that there is no Hou Yi reborn to shoot down the violent sun's arrogance and avenge our unprecedented disgrace!</p>
<p>My friend Chen Ziping is a patriot. His family is wealthy, and he is generous, repeatedly donating large sums of money to kill the enemy. Recently, he built a terrace in his garden called the "Shooting Sun Terrace." The terrace is square, about ten feet high, with a top that is round like a ball, painted bright red, resembling the shape of the sun. And with an arrow through its abdomen. Every morning, Chen brings a bow and arrows to the garden, stands dozens of paces away from the terrace, and shoots arrows at it, to show that he will not live under the same sky as the violent suns. This is why the terrace is named "Shooting Sun." Chen said: Although arrows are ancient weapons and are not suitable for today, once we serve on the battlefield, when engaging in close combat, striking first can inflict heavy damage on the enemy. This is another plan to shoot down the suns.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I accepted Chen's invitation to go and see it. In the garden, the golden wind was gentle, the leaves were falling, the autumn insects were chirping, as if mourning for the Northeast. The sun-shaped top of the terrace, battered by wind and rain, dripped with cold dew, and the abdomen was pierced by an arrow. After repeated shooting by Chen, the songs of Chu from all sides completely changed the old view. It is not precarious, is it about to collapse? Alas! I hope that our court and the people will be united in heart and mind, go to the great disaster together, wield Lu Yang's spear, hold Hou Yi's arrows, drive away these violent suns, and pacify the world. This is the essence of Chen's establishment of the Shooting Sun Terrace. Therefore, I write this record for it.</p>
<h3>The Philosophy of Hats</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Some people say that marrying a wife is like buying a felt hat. The hats in the shop window, whether flat-brimmed or rolled-brimmed, whether gray or ochre, all seem beautiful and lovely; but once you buy one, you feel that the rolled-brimmed is better than the flat-brimmed; the gray one always seems not as good-looking as the ochre one, and the hat on your own head seems less beautiful than the one on someone else's head; but when you snatch someone else's hat and put it on your own head, you will immediately find some shortcomings and feel that your old hat is more suitable.</p>
<p>When choosing a hat, don't be too hasty, as haste will make you cheated; and don't be greedy for cheap, as greed will make you regret.</p>
<p>Buying a cheap hat will certainly not satisfy you; but wearing a hat that is too expensive will make you worry: you are afraid of it being blown away by the wind, and you are reluctant to let it get wet in the rain, it will hurt you if rats gnaw on it, and it will be enough to make you sad if a thief steals it; it is better to wear a cheap hat and be at ease, with a hundred and twenty percent peace of mind; you don't mind whether it is rainy or sunny, and even thieves don't bother to covet it.</p>
<p>The hat should not be too old-fashioned, so that people laugh at you; but it should not be too fashionable, so that people stare.</p>
<p>When buying a hat, it is better to buy it a little wider; if it is too tight, it will not be easy to take it on and off, and it will give you a headache when you wear it.</p>
<p>When someone "throws the top" off your head, don't shout for catching the thief or chase after them; because you can't get it back, and it's only funny to others, so what's the point? But you have to know that the reason why you were "thrown the top" is either because the hat is too beautiful, or because you were too careless and deliberately made the hat close to the streetcar window.</p>
<p>Taking a concubine is like buying a straw hat; a beautiful straw hat is really expensive, much more expensive than a felt hat, but it can only be shown off in the summer; when the autumn wind rises, you will think of the old felt hat thrown on top of the bed; take it out and have the laundry company wash it well, and then wear it on your head very comfortably; at that time, your straw hat may have been put on the head of a rickshaw puller as a rain hat, and you don't even want to think about it.</p>
<p>This is the life philosophy of hats!</p>
<h3>Special Feature on the Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>丨Oil, Salt, Soy Sauce, Vinegar, Vegetables, Rice, Firewood, 丨</p>
<p>Noise, disorder, shouting, arguing, dampness, fishiness, dirtiness, clamor—what can you feel in this special market? From the dim morning, when the sun barely penetrates the ground, fish, meat, chicken, duck, vegetables, and scallions are all busily laid out. Water is sprinkled on the ground, and a new day of trading begins.</p>
<p>The people who come to this market to buy food in large quantities are either chefs or stewards. Moreover, they come every day, very, very early, and are familiar with the fishmongers and butchers. Everything is relatively cheaper for them because they are their daily major customers, so it goes without saying that prices are lower. Then there are the maids from the mansions. They also come every day, but a step later than the stewards, and things are also much more expensive. By nine or ten o'clock, there are madams and mistresses who come by hired car with their fourteen-tael scales to the vegetable market. It's only natural that the vendors in the market use small scales, but since the mistresses and madams who come by hired car suspect the maids of pocketing money and fear the small scales in the market, they bring their own scales. But these, too, still measure fourteen taels.</p>
<p>Don't you see them arguing back and forth several times over a single copper coin's worth of business? Don't you see them grabbing an extra handful of bean sprouts after weighing ten copper coins' worth for the buyer? The vendors are certainly cunning, but they also have to make a living. The buyers want things to be cheap and plentiful. As a result, their lips get busy, and they argue until their saliva dries up. Besides these madams and mistresses, there are also the girls with disheveled hair, bare feet, and unbuttoned clothes. It's hard to imagine how they rushed here in such a hurry. And there are many who bring their beautiful clothes to the vegetable market as if they were going out. Perhaps they have forgotten that it is a dirty, smelly place.</p>
<p>This market with its peculiar smell and fishy odor also has many cooked food stalls where people can fill their stomachs. Noodles and beef soup are favorites for those who come to buy food in the morning.</p>
<p>The clamor gradually dissipates by noon. As the dim evening approaches, it becomes a "sleeping ground" that could not be better for the homeless!</p>

<h3>Entering the Pass as Postal Comrades</h3>
<p>— Seeking Happiness Studio Owner</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Shenyang City superficially resembles a miniature model of Beiping City, in concrete and subtle detail. It is just as square, with nine city gates on all four sides, only the city walls are merely a fifth of the size of Beiping City, making it strangely exquisite!</p>
<p>Because the city's area is small, and its market has always been developed, it is difficult to cram all sorts of construction into that small city. The area of the four passes outside the city has been greatly expanded. The east, south, west, and north sides, about four or five li away from the city gate, have thus become industrial, commercial, and residential areas, collectively called the city passes, similar to the outer city of Beiping. Also, on the boundary of these city passes, along the thoroughfares leading to the nine city gates, various types of barrier gates have been built, called by names like such-and-such side gate or convenient gate.</p>
<p>The inner city has two gates on each of its four sides; although the format is common, the names distinguish between large and small. If there is a Large South Gate, there is also a Small South Gate; the same goes for the east and west sides; only the north side has a closed city gate between the Large North Gate and the Small North Gate, specifically built to complete the number of nine city gates, but it is not open. Therefore, there are only eight side gates. They are uniformly divided into Large East, Small East, Large West, Small West, Large South, Small South, Large North, Small North, evenly arranged on all four sides.</p>
<p>Especially the western side, going two or three li beyond the Large West and Small West side gates, there is the South Manchurian Railway Annex, occupied by the Japanese, with a circumference of twenty or thirty li, directly connecting to the South Manchurian Railway's "Fengtian" station, which they stubbornly insist on calling it. Due to the station, such a large annex was carved out, and people often collectively refer to it as the Japanese station or Japanese territory; all powers within are greater than those of concessions in other provinces, simply wanting to avoid acknowledging it as a concession and instead calling it an annex! It usually harbors dirt and accepts filth, doing everything possible, desperately trying to promote the prosperity of this annex, which consequently has combined the areas of Large West Pass, Small West Pass, Large West Side Gate, and Small West Side Gate outside Shenyang City into a very prosperous scene. But this prosperity cannot be picked up for nothing. Once they see it and become greedy, besides gradual encroachment, they can also sweep it all away in one go. Now, hasn't it all been thrown away for nothing? And what has been thrown away is not just these two West Passes, but the entire territory of Northeast China!</p>
<p>But tracing back to the source of the disaster, wasn't it that these two Large and Small West Passes were where they tentatively began their aggression? And on the evening of the September 18th Incident, the disaster also originated at the border of this annex, and the entire Shenyang City was easily obtained by the Japanese army, starting with the loss of the Large West and Small West city passes. A year has passed, but the national humiliation has not been avenged, and the lost territory has not been recovered. The September 18th anniversary has already been commemorated! Writing novels and coming to these most heartbreaking Large West and Small West two passes, I feel extremely painful and cannot help but waste a lot of blood and tears, writing in such a tedious manner; this is not something else, it is really because I cannot forget these two places in my heart!</p>

<h3>Gold Price Rises Seven Taels Two Mace</h3>
<p>Market Conditions Are Very Brisk. Yesterday, the gold market was exceptionally sharp and soaring, but there were no overly large fluctuations. The entire day only saw five taels of retracement, ultimately rising seven taels and some change. Initially, the spot silver market was quite stable, but the forward market plummeted. American cotton futures also fell by more than forty pounds. In particular, news reported that Mexico was aggressively purchasing cash to prepare for switching to the gold standard. With these several major reasons, the market opened high, nearing the 740 tael mark. However, major players, considering the excessive rise and the opportune moment, tended to sell. Moreover, as foreign exchange turned from firm to loose, banks were strongly inclined to sell, so the trend softened, sharply falling by three or four taels. However, there was only a return of one or two taels at midday, and the afternoon market was uneventful. The selling pressure continued, and the situation seemed weak. However, near the close, it became slightly more peaceful, as the price remained above 735 taels, and traders' confidence was very strong. All October contracts, around 300 lots, were traded by Tongfeng Heng, Ruixing Yuanmao Yong, Dacheng, etc., discounted by three to two and a half mace. Due to price disagreements, the spot market did not see any transactions. Now, the detailed history of the past market conditions, both before and after, is listed below.</p>
<p>Early Opening Jumps Wildly by Eleven Taels. The November contract opened at 739.5 taels, a sharp increase of eleven taels (before the market opened, it had reached forty taels in the goods market). Yuhe Yuanchun and others immediately purchased at the listed price, so market conditions were particularly firm. As for large bars, they only rose by one-sixteenth. The silver price did not change, but private telegraphs reported an increase of five-sixteenths. Furthermore, the spot silver futures at the Gold Exchange suddenly rebounded by more than three li, leading to highly elevated sentiment. Subsequently, as Tongtaichang Heng, Yu Fuchang, Yongfeng Yuantai, Yuanmao Yong, and Dalian merchants took advantage of this to sell, it immediately dropped by more than one tael, to 37.8 mace. At this time, HSBC and others offered December US dollars at 375, November at 25. In an instant, Yuanchun, Yuankangxiang, Bingxing Qian, Changxiang Dadecheng, Yifeng Yongfu Yu, etc., bought in, and it rose again by one tael, to 39 taels. Later, Yuanxing Yong, Bingxing Yifeng, Yifeng Yong, etc., offered again, and January US dollars could be settled at half a dollar. Wheat firms offered October British pounds at 19. By almost 9:30, it was 37 taels. HSBC and various banks listed at a small half-notch, both British and American currency at 125, at that time being 7 taels 7 mace. Shortly after, it fell by another 2 taels. Yongfeng Tongtaichang Yifeng Yong Yuantai Fuxing Yong Zhaofeng Chang Hengxing, as well as arbitrageurs, tended to sell aggressively. Moreover, as wheat firms offered December US dollars at 4375, Old Citibank offered January at 5625, November at 375 for settlement, it reached 35.8 taels by 10:30. However, the rebound was only about one tael. Afterwards, Tianfeng Yong, Hengxing Futai, Heng Fuyu, Hengyu Yuanchun, Wanxing, etc., bought in, and it pulled up another two taels, to 38 taels at just after 11:10. Soon, Hengyu Yifeng Yong Yuanxing Yong Yuhe Yuanmao Yong Zhaofeng Chang, etc., diligently sold off. Shanghai and others offered October British pounds at 19, January US dollars still settling at 5625. By 11:50, it was 35.7 taels. Small retail investors bought in slightly, until the midday close at 36.3 taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Situation Becomes More Ordinary. The afternoon market opened at 36.2 taels, then continued from 5.8 mace to 6.5 mace, because Hengchang Yong Yuantai, etc., bought in. Also, Manila came in offering October US dollars at 25, followed by the lower reaches at 1.78 mace. Therefore, Yuanheng Fuyu Zhaofeng Chang Hengyu Daxing Yong, etc., sold off. Moreover, the Bank of China, etc., sold British pounds for November to Hua Bi at 125, and Hua Bi Sanjing did December US dollars for half a dollar, so the gold price reached 34.7 taels by 2:45. Before long, it added another 56 mace. At 3:00, it weakened again. January British pounds were traded again at 25, October US dollars at 3125. And Yuanxing Yong Zhaofeng Chang Wanxing Hongkang Yong, etc., all came to sell, so at 3:20, it was 34.3 taels. Fuchang Fuxing Yong Yuantai bought in, raising it by more than one tael, to 35.7 taels at 3:30. Soon, as HSBC offered October British pounds at 190625, and Xingye offered December US dollars at half a dollar, it was 34.7 taels at 4:10. Afterwards, it seemed to see harmony, Bingxing Hengyu Hongkang Yong, and general retail investors, etc., came to buy in, so the price was pushed up by one tael, to 35.8 taels. At times, it retreated to 5.5 mace, until at 4:30, the market closed at 35.7 taels, a net increase of 7 taels 2 mace compared to the previous day. According to the figures, the highest for the day was 39.5 taels, the lowest 34.3 taels, a difference of 5 taels 2 mace. The gross margin was estimated at 12 to 12.25 taels.</p>
<p>Quotation Discounted by Slightly Four Taels. The quotation listed US dollars at a small 125, resulting in 803 taels, a discount of 6566 taels to 67 taels. The afternoon was 6667 taels to 69 taels, and finally 67 taels, a discount slightly less by four taels compared to the previous day. The registered amount was 41 to 36 taels, with the same supplemental water calculation of 39 taels for both the morning and afternoon.</p>
<p>Various Firms Trade Actively. Trading on the counter was quite lively, but sellers predominated. Statistics show that Yuanchun Hongkang Yong Zhifeng Yong Futai Heng Yuankangxiang Yuandayong all bought in. Bingxing Wanxing Dadecheng Yuhe, etc., went in and out at times. Tongtaichang Hengyu Fuyu Zhaofeng Chang Yuanmao Yong Yifeng Yiyong Yongfeng Fuxing Yong Daxing Yong Yuanmao all sold. Yuanxing Yong sold more than 1,000 lots, Ruixing Dai Qiaorifu sold more than 200 lots, and arbitrageurs also sold. In the afternoon, Wanxing Shunli Yuantai Bingxing Hengchang Yong Yifeng Yiyong all bought in. Hengyu Hongkang Yong sold and then bought in. Fuyu Zhaofeng Chang Yuanmao Yong Yuanxiang Yuanxing Yong Daxing Yong all sold. The Dalian firms first sold and then bought in, selling a total of more than 600 lots and buying in more than 400 lots. Guangbang Hengxing sold more than 600 lots on behalf of customers, while buying in dozens of lots. Yifeng sold more than 100 lots. The total trading volume for various firms was approximately 27,000 lots.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Turns From Firm to Loose</h3>
<p>Gold Firms Take Profits</p>
<p>Arbitrage is Profitable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market saw British pounds rise and US dollars remain stable, but market conditions were still stable. Foreign exchange saw British pounds fall and US dollars rise, but only very slightly. By the time HSBC listed prices in the local market, they had already shrunk by half a bridge. Both British and American currencies were shortened by 125, while Hong Kong did not change. Everything else was further reduced, mostly because internal conditions changed from firm to stable, and the afternoon market became increasingly loose. As a result, British currency shrank by 125 and US currency also only by 125 compared to the previous day, both not as significant as the sharp rise in gold prices. However, trading among Chinese merchants was still smooth, with approximately 100,000 pounds of British currency traded. Banks did not raise rates for interbank transactions. Also, 780,000 US dollars were traded. Most gold firms took profits and went short, and as gold prices were high, arbitrage was profitable, estimated at 5253 taels for October, 46 taels for December, 43 taels for January, with settlement prices estimated to be discounted by 6768 taels. Banks also engaged in interbank transactions. Mumbai and Manila both came to buy October contracts, mostly because banks were strongly inclined to sell and few were taking delivery, so the market was not able to shine.</p>
<p>British Exchange: The domestic market hovered around 1875 throughout the day. The selling price opened at one shilling eight pence 875 for October, 9375 for November, nine pence for December, and 0625 for January. The buying price for all months was the selling price plus 0625. Macaulay, Zhongfu, and Shanghai all offered nine pence for October. The midday close offered nine pence to 1875, with a buying price of 0625 to 25. In the afternoon, Zhongfu and Hua Bi did November at nine pence 0625 with each other. Dutch Meifeng did January at 25 with each other. The closing price offered nine pence 0625 to 25, with a buying price of 125 to 3125. ▲American Exchange: The domestic market had 3125 up and down throughout the day. The selling price opened at 30 yuan for October, 125 for November, 25 for December, and 375 for January. The buying price was the selling price plus 125.

The closing price offered 30 yuan 25 to 625, with a buying price of 375 to 75. Also, one US dollar equals three taels three mace four fen seven two eight silver.</p>

<p>National News Agency, London, 30th: Large bars have retraced. The closing price for the near term is seventeen pence eleven-sixteenths, the far term seventeen pence thirteen-sixteenths, each falling by one-eighth compared to the previous day. Also, the British-American exchange rate still opened at three dollars and forty-five thousand two hundred and fifty.</p>
<h3>Brief Market Report on the Financial Market for Large Account Period</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the end of September, the only large account period for the silver and money industry. It goes without saying that various collection and settlement procedures were busy. The reporter investigated, which was not easy, and due to time constraints, it was even more difficult to announce in advance. However, the interbank lending rate in the market can still be described. The lending rate for the morning market was six mace nine fen five li seven hao and a half, and for the afternoon market, it was six mace nine fen six li, a slightly better situation by two hao and a half. The volume of transactions for exchange and remittance drafts in the morning market was 875,000, 50,000 in the banknote market, 180,000 outside the market, and 60,000 in checks. The volume of transactions for exchange and remittance drafts in the afternoon market was 860,000, 20,000 in banknotes, 75,000 in banknotes outside the market, and 20,000 in checks. The volume of bank buying and selling was 850,000 in the morning market and 800,000 in the afternoon market. Interbank lending was generally done without interest in both markets, and clearing was also done without adding interest. Banknote trading was over 6 million, trading among small money shops was over 600,000. The inflow and outflow of customer funds is unknown. The price of auxiliary coins, Jiangsu small silver dollars, was six mace zero four li in the morning market and six mace zero two li in the afternoon market, with trading of 3,500 jiao in the morning market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars were five mace eight fen six li six hao two hu and a half in the morning market and five mace eight fen six li eight hao seven hu and a half in the afternoon market, with trading of 115,000 jiao in the morning market and 50,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained at 430,000 wen.</p>
<h3>Calculation of Average Monthly Interest Rate for September</h3>
<p>Interbank lending was very loose last month (September), opening at only two to three fen interest or no interest daily. The market price was still one mace in the first half of the month, but after the middle of the month and until the second half of the month, it was extremely loose. Therefore, the total monthly average interest rate was one tael one mace three fen, with the daily average lending rate accounting for only three fen seven li six hao seven. It is anticipated that the interest rate proposal for tomorrow will still be within a fixed range, around two taels and ninety-five percent.</p>
<h3>Bond Prices Rise Sharply by One Yuan</h3>
<p>The Market Sentiment is Good and Demand is Strong</p>
<p>Four Million Six Hundred Thousand Traded in October</p>
<p>Yesterday (30th), the bond market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange only saw trading of unified tax bonds for 1,000 yuan in the spot market. There was no market for other bonds. October futures saw significant price fluctuations. There was active buying and selling in the market. It is estimated that 2.5 million was traded in the morning, and another 2 million in the afternoon, for a total of 4,590,000. Among them, salt tax accounted for 1,155,000 yuan, unified tax 780,000 yuan, and the 20 Customs and disarmament bonds also had 560,000 each. However, the 96 and Entire 6 Customs bonds were relatively thin. As for the trend of various bonds, although there is still no improvement in the diplomatic situation, the domestic situation seems slightly better than before, and credit conditions are loose. The market sentiment is therefore good, and small retail investors are buying in, and large investors also seem to have some transactions. Therefore, the market demand is quite active, and the price of various bonds has risen sharply, with each trade being firm and showing no sign of weakening. With the exception of spot unified tax bonds, the 96 futures rose only one or two jiao, and the Entire 6 Customs bonds rose six or seven jiao, the rest all rose by about one yuan.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Turns Lower and Weak</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: On Thursday (29th), the New York stock market turned weak due to a lack of support. Today, the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs are playing in the World Baseball Championship. Therefore, speculators went to [watch] the game, and the market [was] quiet. The total trading volume for the day was 1.3 million. This week, brokers loaned a total of 42.5 million yuan, an increase of 1.7 million yuan compared to the previous week.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Market: The yarn market is still stable, but some say that the economic situation in all directions is still not very well-off, and it is difficult to strengthen the purchasing power of farmers. Most small retail investors tend to sell. Generally speaking, it should not break away from the situation of hovering. Although the environment is poor and foreign cotton is sluggish, the inventories of local yarn in Shanghai are still low, so buyers can remain calm. As for what the future holds, it still depends on actual sales to advance or retreat. The human standard is wavering. In the morning opening of the human standard, the situation was very weak due to the downward trend of US cotton, with each month falling by 1.54 mace. Slightly rose in two or three trades. As a result, each month fell by 7, 8, 9 mace to 1 tael. In the afternoon, it was heard that the spot yarn sales market was still good, and each month rebounded by 34 mace. The total turnover for the day was 29,500 bales. It was found that Long sold 1,200 bales, Mingde 1,450 bales, Changji 950 bales, Changfeng 1,500 bales, Yichang 1,500 bales.

<p>Guangdong 125 Ningbo 55 Peer 20 Wenzhou 10</p>
<p>Luzhou 10 Nanjing 25 Jiangxi 5 Total 1,055 bales</p>
<h3>Signs of a Weakening Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending weaker, and the falling trend is intensifying, because US cotton has fallen again, and the domestic climate is favorable, which is conducive to the listing of new cotton. New goods from various routes have entered the market, and are gradually surging. With this unfavorable US cotton, the support of sellers is even stronger. However, most stable people are holding a wait-and-see attitude towards fine-staple standard cotton above 31 taels. However, a certain manufacturer has extremely low thoughts, but currently, with the abundant source of new flowers, buyers are inferior.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Falls Three Mace. In the morning opening of the Zheng Standard, the situation was deteriorating due to the decline in US cotton and favorable weather. Each month fell by 3.5 mace. Slightly rose in two or three trades. In the afternoon, some profit-takers covered their shorts, and each month rose by 0.5 to 1.5 mace. The total trading volume for the day was 88,400 dan. It was found that the sale of scrap was 11,400 dan, Yuanda 3,400 dan, Changfeng 2,300 dan, Jifeng 1,300 dan, Renfeng 1,500 dan. Hengde bought 400 dan, Delong 2,000 dan, Tongxing 2,100 dan, Mingde 2,400 dan, Dachangcheng 2,000 dan, Yiyu 2,200 dan. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>November 3165 35 244,000 Total 1,238,500</p>
<p>December 3170 30 163,600</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Mills Are Bidding Too Low. The demand for spot cotton has also turned lackluster again, because US cotton is falling. Although some manufacturers have intentions to purchase, their bids are too low, making it difficult for both parties to reach an agreement, so business is sluggish. The source is estimated to be 2,580 bales of Yao cotton and 666 bales of Tongzhou cotton. The records of spot cotton sales are as follows.</p>
<p>Yao Cotton 29.50 Guangbang purchased 200 bales Cash Delivery</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Downstream is Looser</h3>
<p>Hunan Rice Market. The source in the lanes of the rice market is about 30 houses, with Luyang sharp rice being the most. Transactions on this street are becoming sluggish day by day. Sijing red rice temporarily rose and fell in opening. Chen Broken and Yang Sharp Rice fell. Only the Bianyuan wine households moved slightly, increasing by a little bit.</p>
<p>Xinzha. There are about 345 units of domestic goods arriving. The city and rural stores are selling poorly, and the green market is not prosperous. In addition, with new goods rising daily and foreign rice being abundant, people's hearts are calm. Dongxin, Xixin, and Beipo are shaped by 34 jiao, and early and late sharp rice</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice is Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was in a stagnant shape. There was no in the morning. In the afternoon, there was an inquiry from the North help, but because of its magnitude, it could not be achieved. This street only responded to a hundred bags of small tangled rice, priced at eight yuan three jiao seven fen. The customer Xian was silent. Nearly a thousand bags of Xiang rice still existed, but were affected by the downstream points and trucks, and no local customers asked about it.</p>
<h3>September Flour and Noodle Delivery Volume</h3>
<p>Only 14,000 Bags of Green Wheat Flour from Zhilu Wheat Root</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery day for September futures flour. The total delivery volume for the entire day was only 14,000 bags of Green Wheat Flour from Huafeng. The other factories did not deliver any. It is said that most of the warehouse receipts of this type were returned goods or head-to-head deliveries. Of the recipients, only two to three thousand bags were taken by local businesses, with the rest being mostly head-to-head. However, the future flour market is expected to decline due to weak actual sales, the gradual import of foreign wheat, and the time when rice prices are greatly relaxed. Furthermore, foreign wheat quotations fell by a few dimes yesterday, indicating that the foreign wheat market is still in a state of oversupply.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Bulls Exit</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Xinfeng Foreign Firm, on Thursday (29th), Chicago wheat prices fell by 0.75 to 0.875 pence due to weakness in the New York cotton market and Canadian wheat. The total volume traded on the 28th was 30 million bushels. The market prices for the 29th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price　　　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>September Future 51.750　　Down 0.875</p>
<p>December Future 53.875　　Down 0.875</p>
<p>May Future 59.000　　Down 0.750</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea from New Wuxi Factories Shipped to Shanghai in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Over 400 Pieces Recently Transported by the Chinese Communists</p>
<p>Since the raw silk from the Bai factories for European and American sales has been successively dispatched since the middle of last month, the local and foreign firms have undertaken a significant number of September (i.e., this month) futures silk. As the end of the month is approaching, they must be delivered on schedule. Therefore, the raw silk from the Wuxi silk factories has been transported to Shanghai in batches before the deadline. In recent days, the total number transported by the Chinese Communists has reached 487 pieces, all of which were delivered to foreign firms yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Silk Market at Foreign Firms Remains Sluggish</h3>
<p>The silk market at local foreign firms continued to be sluggish yesterday. It is noted that sales of Chinese silk factory products in the European and American markets have not improved. Telegrams indicate a decline, and the prices are still low. Various firms are reluctant to sell. Yesterday, only ten bales of white raw silk from the Hu Silk Factory were sold, along with ten bales of dry raw silk from Zhonghe, and ten bales of gray silk from Changchang.</p>
<h3>Russian Firm Purchases a Large Amount of "Hua Xiang" Tea</h3>
<p>Since the UK increased import duties on tea, the sale of "Hua Xiang" black tea from Qimen and Jiazhou through British national channels has been completely blocked. The Russian Assistance Society is unwilling to purchase unless the price is very low. In recent months, apart from some sales by local shops, the outlet has been exceptionally obstructed. However, it is reported that the Russian Assistance Society firm has purchased a total of 15,000 boxes of Qining "Hua Xiang" tea from the market's external inventory because they received permission from the head office via telegram. They purchased it at the lowest price of 8 taels per dan. Based on the cost to Chinese merchants, they are incurring substantial losses.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Prices of All Types Rise Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued its upward trend as the benchmark price rose again. The guild's clearing price for No. 24 granulated white sugar from Changxing Bank was 14 taels and 9 mace and 5 fen per 600 bags, an increase of 7 fen and 5 li compared to the previous day, and it was quite popular. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was offered at 14 taels and 3 mace. No. 18 medium granulated white sugar from the Huaxin Foreign Firm was offered at 14 taels per 1,000 bags, an increase of 1 qian compared to the previous day (28th). No. 10 Dutch red sugar was offered at 11 taels and 1 mace. No. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar was offered at 10 taels and 7 or 8 qian. On the scarce side, Dalaihao offered over 100 boxes of top-quality Wufu white crystal sugar at 10 taels and 5 fen per bar. They planned to raise the price because the raw materials had already risen, making it inevitable. Also, other firms offered 50 to 60 boxes of Taiyuan white crystal sugar at 10 taels and 4 qian per bar. There were some transactions in raw sugar, with the price at 13 taels and 1 mace and 5 fen, an increase of 5 fen compared to the previous day. According to Huaxin's asking price of 13 taels and 2 mace, the outlook is also favorable.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Officially Certified Xingyuan Arrives in Shanghai from the North and South</h3>
<p>The first batch of officially certified Xinghua sample dumplings matured this autumn, but due to scarce rainfall, the shipment was delayed for a long time to allow the individual dumplings to grow larger. According to reliable information, the first batch of goods arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. However, because the Shunan Wheel, which departed later, was detained in Hanjiang and could not arrive together, there is great concern that the market price will be disrupted. Therefore, they must be released and arrive in Shanghai together before they can be sold.</p>
<h3>Coal: Brisk Trading in Marc Coal Dust</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market saw quite a bit of trading in Marc white coal dust, totaling over 400 tons. The price rose by 1 qian and 5 fen, and it is now selling for 8 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen per ton. Both Hongqi dust and Haifeng dust also saw transactions of 270 tons, and the price remained firm. However, the outlet for Liujiang coal dust was quite weak, and the trend was downward. Yesterday, it was sold for only 5 taels and 6 qian per ton.</p>

<h3>Four Types of People</h3>
<p>— Zu'e</p>
<p>People's "view of life" is not fixed. Each person has their own "view of life." Even within one person, the value changes with time. Mencius said, "When blood and qi are vigorous, one should be wary of fighting; when one is old and blood and qi have declined, one should be wary of greed." Therefore, I quietly pondered and thought of four types of people.</p>
<p>These four types of people are: one who wants money more than life, one who wants life more than money, one who wants both money and life, and finally, one who wants neither life nor money. Analyzing these four types of people, one finds them worthy of pity, laughter, lamentation, and sighing.</p>
<p>The first type: those who want money more than life. This type can be classified as kidnappers, thieves, money-grubbers, and laborers living inhuman lives. They do not take their own lives seriously at all. For the sake of money, they can disregard their lives. Thieves, for example, are essentially preparing to risk their lives for robbery. As for money-grubbers, it is easier to take their lives than their money. They spend their entire lives "fighting" with money. Secondly, the laborers living inhuman lives are in a more pitiable situation. Although it can be said that they have no choice but to do so for the sake of survival, I still feel it is more accurate to say that they want money more than life. In short, this type of person is a pitiful one in society.</p>
<p>The second type: those who want life more than money. This type is relatively rare. Aside from those who are truly honest, upright, and do not covet wealth, those who are devout in religion can also be included. For example, Buddhists view money as something external, and the Ten Commandments of Christianity prohibit greed. They only cultivate themselves and are indifferent to material possessions and money. Although it is rare to find people of this type who are consistent in words and deeds and understand thoroughly, their conditions of belief are indeed such. This type of person does not seem to have much connection with society, except that they give a sense of shame to those who are insatiable in their greed.</p>
<p>The third type: those who want both life and money. Looking around, there are quite a few people of this type. From wealthy merchants and nobles to old prostitutes in brothels, they all value money as much as life and life as much as money, cherishing both equally. They want to preserve their health and longevity while also making more money and getting rich. Capitalists hire bodyguards to protect themselves, guarding their bodies as if they were important criminals. This is their desire for life. They rack their brains to extract wealth from the people. This is their desire for money. Even some nobles and important figures nowadays cannot escape this kind of behavior. Those of a lower kind, like old prostitutes in brothels, are desperate for money but unwilling to exert physical or mental effort. They also want both life and money. It has been exactly one year since the three northeastern provinces were trampled upon by Japanese soldiers. The officials who lost the territory sacrificed the country lightly in order to make money and preserve their lives. Therefore, this type of person who wants both life and money is truly the most contemptible, the most harmful to society, and the most lamentable.</p>
<p>The fourth type: those who want neither life nor money. This type is naturally very rare. Originally, how many people can disregard their lives and not love money? Fortunately, there is something that is barely satisfactory, which is that this type of person has emerged in China in considerable numbers. The Northeast Volunteer Army, known to society, can be considered representatives of those who want neither life nor money. They are truly "reckless" in fighting the Japanese. Money cannot tempt their hearts. They have forgotten their homes and their lives, knowing only to fight for the nation and save the country. Rising and falling, attacking and ambushing, going without food for several days is nothing. Killing the enemy is the most important thing. For a year, they have driven the enemy to desperation, causing them to be startled several times a night. They want neither life nor money. Only they can bear this burden. This fourth type of person is truly worthy of admiration and respect.</p>
<p>Having finished writing about these four types of people, readers, please look around in China and see which type is more numerous?</p>

<h3>On a Boat to Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Hu Jianzhan, Xiuning</p>
<p>On the way from Chongqing to Chengdu, I was stranded in Leshan by rain and casually composed a poem to present to the two elders, Xichen and Shunan.</p>
<p>Drizzling rain on the lonely city, my melancholy deepens,</p>
<p>The river swells three feet, how many more journeys am I delayed?</p>
<p>My heart is entangled with dreams of returning home, regretting this distant expedition,</p>
<p>My companions are all talented, we chat late into the autumn night by the lamplight.</p>
<p>Responding to Elder Xi with the Previous Rhyme</p>
<p>Following you to Chengdu, I forge a friendship regardless of age,</p>
<p>Humbly admiring your virtue, I wish to learn from you like standing in snow,</p>
<p>The great journey rises like dragons and snakes, wild geese migrate to the south,</p>
<p>Filled with emotions, I cannot sleep at night, the moon outside the window is like a lamplight.</p>

<h3>Gutta-percha</h3>
<p>— Gu Hu</p>
<p>The inner layer of electric wires, wrapped around the copper wire, is a rubber-like substance; this is gutta-percha. Gutta-percha's electrical conductivity is less than that of various rubbers, making it a truly insulating material. Therefore, it is used to make various electrical machinery. It also has a special function! It does not react with hydrofluoric acid, so it is also used chemically as a bottle for storing hydrofluoric acid. The newly invented free skin on the market is also a type of gutta-percha.</p>
<p>The composition of gutta-percha consists of carbon and hydrogen, as well as oxygen. Its method of production is to extract its coagulated liquid from the ironwood tree in the Malay Peninsula, heat and refine it, and then let it cool to become a solid. The pure form is white, and the impure form is brown. If more than 30% sulfur is added during heating, it will harden and is called hard rubber. Immersed in warm water or heated, it will become soft like taffy! It can then be arbitrarily molded into various items. If hard rubber is heated and bleached with sulfur dioxide, it will become a shiny, clean, hard, keratinous material! It can also be used to make artificial teeth, or if pentasulfide is added, it will become a red keratinous material. When rubbed, it emits a very beautiful luster and is used to make fake ox horn combs.</p>
<p>Gutta-percha is very similar to rubber, so it is also called Malay rubber. Because it is extracted from trees, I call it gutta-percha.</p>

<p>The Problem of Improving Children's Reading Materials</p>
<p>The Differences Between Gods and Monsters and Bird and Animal Language</p>
<p>The recent discussions in this supplement on the improvement of children's reading materials have sparked debate among Cimin, Shunchi, and Shina. However, the focus of their arguments has been on the merits of "gods and monsters" versus "bird and animal language." In fact, these two points are indeed different, but Mr. Shina knows that they are different without knowing what the differences are. Therefore, what was originally not a problem has become one. The differences between "gods and monsters" and "bird and animal language" can be explained as follows:</p>
<p>Although "gods and monsters" and "bird and animal language" both belong to allegories, they also have differences between "pure fiction" and "semi-fiction" because of the different subjects of the allegory. The composition of a fact cannot be separated from three points: (1) subject, (2) behavior, and (3) language. If one of these three items is "realistic" or "natural," then the allegory belongs to "semi-fiction."</p>
<p>Gods and monsters are originally illusory and ethereal things. In the general concept of people, "gods and monsters" often contain mysterious and terrifying elements. Birds and beasts are originally real animals and are commonly seen by everyone. Therefore, although both are allegories, there is actually a difference between "pure fiction" and "semi-fiction."</p>
<p>Looking at the advantages and disadvantages, there are also differences. Because the former contains too much of a "mysterious and terrifying" element, it is not easy to wash away after being imprinted in the minds of children, and there is no way to prove its authenticity, which is tantamount to cultivating the power of "superstition." The latter's subjects are mostly seen by children. The behavior of birds and beasts, whether they can speak, is a fact known to everyone and can be understood as an allegory without explanation. Therefore, even if their effect on arousing children's interest is the same, there is a big difference in the use of teaching materials.</p>
<p>As for the teaching materials currently used, there are indeed many questionable points in the compilation of "bird and animal language." However, most of these shortcomings are due to the editors' shallow knowledge and excessive consideration of children's interests, while abandoning the cultivation that children should have in life. It cannot be regarded as "bird and animal language" and "gods and monsters" having only the same value.</p>
<p>Recently, European and American children's reading materials have not abandoned "bird and animal language," but in fact, they have gradually leaned towards realistic life. The teaching materials they use mostly center on society and instill civic knowledge in children through extremely detailed and trivial facts. Even the purpose of the "bird and animal language" allegory is mostly the same. In other words, the behaviors and languages recorded are all natural phenomena of humans and are commonly seen. In these reading materials, only the common birds and beasts are replaced as their subjects. Therefore, although this method belongs to allegory, it has actually broken through the "barriers of real language" and is striving towards naturalization.</p>
<p>The lack of children's reading materials in China is indeed an undeniable fact. If we want to improve them, it seems difficult to find another way other than to move forward on this path. (Moved to donate to the Northeast Volunteer Army)</p>
<p>Business Sutra</p>
<h3>The Infallible Method in Business</h3>
<p>— Shiben</p>
<p>Yesterday, my old friend Hong Zidong visited me. Mr. Hong is a businessman who works for a large foreign cloth firm on the sea. This firm is very prosperous and is a giant in the foreign cloth industry in Shanghai. Since its establishment, it has made considerable profits. Those in the same industry who compete with it often fail. Even a neighboring firm with strong capital and lower prices still falls far behind and cannot compete. I don't know why this is, resulting in such good results. Now, taking advantage of Mr. Hong's visit, I asked about the secret. He told me in detail about the special methods of the firm's business. I felt that his words could be emulated by merchants, so I recorded them.</p>
<p>Mr. Hong said that the manager of the firm, Mr. So-and-so, is quick-witted, has a clever mind, is flexible, and is familiar with the ways of business and the psychology of customers. When each partner enters the store, he must tell them the direction of the business and the various techniques for dealing with customers. He also said that in this era of commercial warfare, it will be difficult to win if you rely solely on the rigid and ancient method of "genuine goods at fair prices, no deception of the old or young" to respond and call upon customers. Therefore, you must open up new paths and use new scientific methods to deal with them in order to control victory. The methods he mentioned are roughly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To satisfy customers with goods, you should use the highlighting method. For example, if a customer wants to buy a certain amount of red satin, you should also take out a blue satin and place it next to the red satin, pretending to encourage them to buy the blue satin. By placing the red and blue goods side by side, the red satin will naturally be highlighted by the blue satin, adding to its beauty. The customer will surely express satisfaction, and the business will be concluded. If they buy blue satin, use red satin to highlight it. If they buy black silk, use white silk to highlight it. In short, focus on the word "highlighting," and you will be invincible. (2) Cater to the psychology of customers. If a customer says "too bad" as soon as they hear a low price, this customer must like to be extravagant. A low price does not match the goods. You should replace the cheaper goods with more expensive labels in the stockroom and then respond to the customer. When the customer hears the high price, they will surely say "good, good." (Mr. Hong also said that once, a customer bought a straight-woven woolen fabric. I offered him goods worth 1.2 yuan. When he heard the low price, he said "too bad" without even examining the goods carefully. Fortunately, the manager was nearby and immediately said to the customer, "Good goods, yes, yes, are upstairs. Wait a moment, I'll go get them." He took the 1.2-yuan goods from the counter into the back. After a while, he came out and said to the customer, "Are these goods good? 2.6 yuan." The customer kept saying "good, good" and the deal was done. I realized that the so-called 2.6-yuan goods were still the same 1.2-yuan goods. I secretly sighed at the manager's skill.) If a customer says "too good" as soon as they hear the price of the goods, this customer must be economical. You should take a very expensive piece and place it next to the cheaper goods, telling them that the other piece costs so much. Now, the price of these goods is really very cheap. When the customer sees that one piece is so expensive and this piece is only so much, the difference between the expensive and the cheap is obvious. They will naturally feel that the goods they want to buy are cheap and immediately make the deal.</p>
<p>(3) Give small favors to female customers. Women all like to take small advantages. Therefore, among the goods they buy, choose something small and inexpensive and give them a special discount, breaking the rules and cutting the price. A total of a few cents of savings can be slightly increased in the price of the expensive goods. If they save so much on expensive goods, they will be overjoyed and feel that everything is cheap. Or, after the transaction is completed, give them some small gifts such as handkerchiefs or soaps. They will surely be beaming and grateful. Next time, they will not leave even if you drive them away or scold them.</p>
<p>(4) Be friendly and courteous. This method is also important. People in Chinese stores often treat customers with harsh words and stern faces, making their faces as stiff as armor. Doing business is like looking for a fight. In this era of commercial competition, if you still use such an attitude, your business will be greatly affected. The manager understands this drawback, so he repeatedly warns all partners to be friendly and courteous to customers, making them happy, and the business will develop accordingly.</p>
<p>There are also creeds such as being attentive and courteous and returning overpaid money or lost items in full, which are also infallible methods for developing business.</p>
<p>No Way Out</p>
<h3>Disappointment</h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>In modern society, which values clothes over human feelings, I unfortunately have a relative who is a well-known figure in the banking industry. Although there are still many friends who have not encountered rubber stamps who are envying me for having rich relatives, I graduated from middle school three years ago. I stepped into society without knowing the immensity of the world, thinking that a middle school graduate could show off their abilities. But three years have passed, and I am still the same. Although I haven't starved to death, I have become inhuman, just a machine for eating and defecating. Of course, at this time, I thought of my rich relative, a well-known figure in the banking industry, with a car and a foreign house. So, I prepared several gifts and asked my wife to make a trip, because I speak bluntly and I was afraid of offending the rich, wouldn't I be breaking my own rice bowl? This was before the Shanghai War. My wife came back and told me very satisfied, "Uncle Xu welcomed me very much and hopes that you (me) will often go to his house to talk. Regarding finding a job, he said that he would call you if there was an opportunity. Before leaving, he also told me to go often and not to estrange relatives..." I knew my wife had encountered a rubber stamp, but she didn't have my three years of experience. How would she know that their sweet words were completely like the intoxicating soup of a prostitute? After receiving your gifts, they have to give you an empty glutinous rice ball in return. At that time, I also smiled it off. Knowing it was a blind cat catching a dead mouse, the poor are always the poor!</p>
<p>Eight or nine months of eating and defecating have passed, and I have gained many arts that were not taught in school, such as flattering, bragging, cheating, intimidating, and so on, to be applied anytime, anywhere, and to anyone. A few days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, we poor people were trying to escape this difficult situation when suddenly Uncle Xu's wife, Aunt Xu, came to our little room. I was both surprised and delighted. The rich also have leftovers to take care of the poor. I had already been assured by Uncle Xu that I would get a job as one of three clerks at some bank. I only needed to write an application to go to the office. I thought this was not a matter of begging the rich, but of the rich bestowing it upon me. So, after writing a letter of self-recommendation, I talked with my friends as if I was already a well-known figure in the banking industry, with the demeanor of a foreign house and a car. By the Mid-Autumn Festival, I had to prepare several gifts again and go on a ceremonial visit (in modern parlance) to greet and thank him, wanting to find out when I could start. I also called him Uncle Xu... Uncle Xu... as I came back.</p>
<p>Looking at the calendar, a dozen days had passed and there was no news. My wife went again, but the landlord was not at home. I heard that the banking figure had gone to Nanjing on business. Of course, the poor are always the poor! When the rich are unhappy, they don't even bother with you! Being stamped with a rubber stamp is still fortunate, a little favor is enough to make you feel flattered.</p>
<p>In despair, I felt like I was 10 yuan poorer during the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>

<h3>Class</h3>
<p>— Jian Chao</p>
<p>The classroom was filled with people. Apart from two or three individuals occasionally whispering, the rest were quietly preparing their assignments.</p>
<p>"Hey! Why isn't Mr. W here yet? Did the bell ring already?" Student S seemed a little impatient.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>"The bell rang quite a while ago. But Mr. W isn't here yet. This is really unexpected! I think he might be sick. Otherwise, why wouldn't he be here? He's never asked for leave or been late before!" E, who shared a desk with S, chimed in. "Ugh, I really don't like his class. It's so unreasonable. He always gives me the hardest questions to do, as if he's deliberately picking on me. I haven't prepared for English at all today. Don't laugh, but every time I have this class, I get a headache. My eyes are on the book, but my mind has already wandered off to the Grand Theater. If the teacher doesn't come, I'll really have to thank heaven and chant Buddha's name. Hmph, what's the use of learning this garbage? It's not like I'll be relying on it to earn a living." C joined the conversation, sounding both pleased and resentful. "Z, let's go for a walk in the back playground. Sitting in this prison-like classroom is really suffocating." The two of them dashed out of the classroom, hopping and skipping towards the back playground.</p>
<p>"Sigh! C is indeed a smart child. It's a pity she's too lazy to study and too arrogant." A voice sighed in regret.</p>
<p>"Yes! If she were willing to put her clever mind to studying, she would definitely become someone accomplished in the future. Didn't Mr. W say that? Mr. W has a mysterious effect on C." A playful taunt.</p>
<p>"Really? How do you know? What does C think? Everyone acknowledges that Mr. W is a talented and handsome person. Ha, ha, so C doesn't have to worry about failing English? Ah! No wonder he always pays special attention to her in class and teaches her differently from us. He's always afraid she won't understand."</p>
<p>"How could I not know? Let me tell you, Mr. W's cousin is a classmate of my cousin. That's what she told me. As for whether C also has feelings for him, only she herself knows. We certainly don't know."</p>
<p>"A series of clicking leather shoe sounds" approached from afar, interrupting their conversation.</p>
<p>"The teacher's here. Let's start class," a mixed voice said.</p>
<p>A young man in a handsome Western suit, with a pleasant smile, walked up to the podium. At the same time, he uttered a few polite words.</p>
<p>"I'm late today. I think this is the first time, isn't it?" He slowly opened the book, his eyes glancing around, as if observing something.</p>
<p>"What's the matter? C isn't here today?" Everyone's gaze focused on the teacher's face because of this sentence. "She came early, but she got impatient waiting for the teacher, so she and Z ran to the back playground to play ball."</p>
<p>"Then go call them both here;"</p>
<p>Mr. W seemed lost in thought. He didn't speak, nor did he teach.</p>
<p>"Teacher, please teach us today's lesson quickly. It's almost time for class to end;"</p>
<p>The students called out impatiently.</p>
<p>"Oh! Today? Let's teach the fourteenth lesson from the Second Book of Observation Thought and Expression. It's Passive Conjugation..." While he answered the students like this, his eyes kept looking out the window. A series of rapid leather shoe sounds.</p>
<p>"Click-clack" ran into the classroom.</p>
<p>Mr. W couldn't help but reveal a slight smile.</p>
<p>"C doesn't even know when class starts. She needs to be asked to come. What a big shot."</p>
<p>"That's not true. It's only because you are..." C glanced at the teacher's face with her captivating eyes. She defended herself strongly like this. However, no one could hear what she said next. Only C's mouth could be seen moving slightly. The teacher didn't show any anger. He still opened the book with a pleasant smile and became as enthusiastic as usual.</p>
<p>Fantasy</p>
<h3>The Gentle and Refined Nanny</h3>
<p>— Hong Shui</p>
<p>Yin'er cried incessantly in her bedding, her entire being filled with longing for her mother! Hoping that she would come quickly, her father tried to coax her with talk of buying foreign dolls. Not only did the crying not stop, but she even jumped and thrashed about vigorously in the bed. Mr. Hu was already feeling extremely bored and weary because his wife had returned to Hong Kong, and now Yin'er was crying and fussing in front of him, making him feel even more listless and depressed.</p>
<p>When Ah Si received a large batch of letters from the green-uniformed mailman, he was quite surprised. Only then did he realize that it was because young master Hu had placed an advertisement in the newspaper seeking a nanny.</p>
<p>"It is a great honor to be invited by Mr. Hu for an interview!" A young woman with a kind face and simple attire said, nodding and smiling.</p>
<p>"Don't be so polite! Now, I will have to trouble you..."</p>
<p>"A lively, innocent, adorable child is such a blessing! How old is she now?"</p>
<p>"Not at all, not at all. She just turned five this year. Ms. Liang, what kind of work have you done before? Where did you study?"</p>
<p>"I came to Shanghai from the X X Women's Normal School in my hometown to be the music director at X X Elementary School, and also taught a kindergarten class. Unfortunately, the Shanghai War broke out suddenly, greatly affecting the school, which has not yet recovered. I have been wasting away at home ever since. I am very eager to take the position of nanny! May I ask about the salary?" Her attitude was very sincere. "Ms. Liang is passionate about education, I admire that! As for the salary here, it's twenty yuan a month, including room and board. However, my child has a bad temper! She loves to cry, especially since her mother went home. She cries so loudly it's almost earth-shattering. I don't know if you have the patience to teach her? Hahaha."</p>
<p>"Although I wouldn't dare say that I can take on the responsibility of loving your son to what extent, based on my past experience, as long as I understand the child's personality thoroughly, I believe it won't be difficult for Mr. Hu to be quite satisfied."</p>
<p>From then on, Mr. Hu could still go to school to teach, and his spirits gradually improved. Yin'er also seemed to have a natural affinity for the nanny, and her temperament became gentler. After finishing her homework, she often went out to play with the nanny. Therefore, he was very relieved about everything. However, today was different. Mr. Hu lay on the sofa, smoking a cigarette and staring blankly at the ceiling. He had no smile on his face and looked haggard. Where had Yin'er and Ms. Liang gone all night? Just as he was thinking, he suddenly received a letter demanding two thousand five hundred yuan to ransom Yin'er. Mr. Hu was so frightened that he almost became a nervous wreck. He couldn't help but mutter loudly;</p>
<p>"How could such a gentle and refined nanny be a kidnapper in disguise? Alas! How can society be like this?"</p>
<p>Family Problems</p>
<h3>A Snobbish Family</h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>Mother Huang was over fifty years old and was a first-class old-fashioned person. Her husband had died four years ago, but fortunately, she had three sons and tens of thousands of dollars in savings. How happy she was, enjoying her old age.</p>
<p>The eldest and second sons were already married. The second daughter-in-law's family was rich, but the eldest daughter-in-law's family was not. In Mother Huang's old mind, of course, she was biased, favoring the second daughter-in-law very much and looking down on the eldest daughter-in-law somewhat. This was also driven by snobbery!</p>
<p>Because Mother Huang favored the second daughter-in-law, she assigned all the heavy chores to the eldest daughter-in-law. The eldest daughter-in-law was also very virtuous and hardworking, but unequal treatment, over time, would also lead to changes! The eldest daughter-in-law saw the second daughter-in-law relaxing leisurely, while she herself was busy from morning to night, so she sometimes resented secretly. From resentment to resistance, this was also human nature!</p>
<p>I remember once, the eldest daughter-in-law and the second daughter-in-law had an argument. The second daughter-in-law, used to being pampered, complained to Mother Huang. Mother Huang scolded the eldest daughter-in-law;</p>
<p>"Hey! You poor thing, born with a poor person's bones, cheap bones. Look at the second daughter-in-law's dowry, all mahogany furniture and jewelry. What about you? Just a few wretched things, not worth a penny. And you still want to argue, your temper is not small. If you want to enjoy life, you shouldn't have been born into a poor family..."</p>
<p>These words left the eldest daughter-in-law speechless, her heart felt as if it were pierced by a volley of arrows. How painful! She could only lament and weep, living her oppressed life.</p>
<p>In the Attic</p>
<h3>Enticement From Above</h3>
<p>— Xi Niao</p>
<p>The Solitude of a Bachelor</p>
<p>The bleak west wind had already used the power of autumn to drive away the humid summer. I loved to watch the beautiful scenery of the white clouds, inherent in autumn and like pieces of sheer gauze, closely clinging to the high blue sky. So, I often stood idly on the quiet B Road, looking up at the pale autumn clouds...</p>
<p>"Brother Luo Qing, long time no see, how are you...?"</p>
<p>A voice I hadn't heard in a long time suddenly came. It made me unexpectedly happy, like flowers blooming in my heart. I replied busily; "Brother Wu Ru, how are you? Our reunion is truly a stroke of fate. Where do you live now?"</p>
<p>"Everything else is fine, it's just that the place I live now often gives me a kind of layered enticement, which is the real trouble." Zhou Wu Ru, whom the classmates had nicknamed "Bloodhead Friend," suddenly felt distressed by some kind of layered enticement, which truly surprised me and made me feel like a baffled monk, unable to figure it out and amused.</p>
<p>The talkative him seemed to be encouraged by my surprised expression, which agitated his naturally thin lips. Inviting him to sit at my house for a while was said to be unnecessary, but the origin of the layered enticement was obediently and fluently told;</p>
<p>"I now live in a small so-called back building. Very close neighbors; in the front building lives a middle-aged couple. The disparity in stature between this couple is as comically interesting as Laurel and Hardy on the screen. The man is as thin and small as a sparrow, while the woman is as fat as a pig. The couple's feelings are utterly wonderful, they almost wish that heaven would never dawn. Ah! Brother Luo Qing! You haven't tasted my kind of life, I am often awakened from sweet dreams by their intense vibrating sounds, mixed struggling groans, and lewd giggling sounds, and incoherent mumbling sounds... which makes my weak heart experience an indescribable throbbing, and my hot blood undergoes an indescribable boiling. Alas! All kinds of threats, making me, a bachelor who has only one layer between them, feel embarrassed and awkward, and subjecting me to a lot of bad influences and bad fantasies..."</p>
<p>He narrated in one breath. I couldn't help but let out a smile of an unknown flavor and hastily said to him:</p>
<p>"This is an important problem. Don't continue to live there passively, otherwise, your health may be impacted!"</p>
<p>"But I can't find a suitable place to live for the time being, and there is no way to avoid it. Now I often put books that are beneficial to my body and mind, such as "Youth's Health Preservation", by my side, to resist this restless disturbance and extremely filthy environment..."</p>
<p>"The resistance of books can never be as powerful as that of brute force. I advise you to leave this arena, don't let your soul be muddled and your safety compromised." I seemed to be guiding him in a tone of an elder, somewhat like an order.</p>
<p>"The words are indeed true. Fortunately, I still believe in myself and won't act recklessly."</p>
<p>He seemed to have urgent matters and hurriedly made an appointment with me to meet again tomorrow and headed west.</p>
<p>The earth was covered by a black curtain, and I naturally thought of everything in the night world. In the surroundings of urbanized Shanghai, there are all kinds of provocative developments, even the harm of layered enticements! You may have slaughtered and poisoned many young people.</p>
