<h3 id="c1">驕者必敗 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>彬</p>
<p>驕傲是［勝利］或［成功］的死敵在軍事上驕傲更其是一個可怕的名詞因爲［驕者」歷史上告訴我們是没有不敗的</p>
<p>當日軍於一月二十八晚决定向我開放第一顆進攻的槍彈之先在他們的心目中何嘗承認中國有半個敢於抵抗的男兒所以鹽澤敢於向駐滬各國領事發出［四小時内必可全部解决華軍］的大話而且似乎對於這種大話的實現毫無疑慮一種驕悍的形態盎然可掬果然在［驕者必敗］的鐵律之下戰幕揭開日軍便很輕易地獲得丁幾次的挫敗</p>
<p>日駐美大使出淵於訪晤史汀生之後曾對美聯社記者說［野村海軍中將現赴上海與美艦隊總司令台納少將作球戲兩領袖作球戲時兩軍亦必作球戲］最近鹽澤和野村失敗後日本軍閥還說［十九路軍因爲向來不知道大日本帝國皇軍的威嚴才敢抵抗的這種驕而且慢視兵兇戰危爲兒戲事的氣槪竟與左傳上所記楚子玉使門勃向晋侯請戰說［請與君之士戲君憑軾而觀之得臣與寓目焉］的故事逼肖日人狃於淸日日俄兩次戰爭的勝利趾高氣揚凌視世界遠航攻我志在必勝但終於］易司令屢戰屢北所謂［四小時必全部解决華軍的豪語竟成爲］句使世人齒冷的笑話這正是［驕者必敗］的一個近例一個眼前的實證</p>
<p>然而這事實對於我們却正是一種寳貴的教訓這教訓我們應該鄭重接受目前我們雖說獲得了幾次勝利但我們切忌因此而驕肆我們科學的軍備與國力都遠不如人所可恃的只有［公理］［壯氣］與［熱血］我們應當以臨深履薄而又沉着刻苦的態度準備長時間的更艱苦的血戰［持其志毋暴其氣］當［橫暴］已陳尸於［公理］的足前的時候我們才能破口唱出［凱旋之歌］</p>
<p>國人記着［驕者必敗］艱苦的奮鬥還才開始此時勝利還不是我們口唱凱旋的時候</p>

<p>記者昨赴閘北前綫、得遇師長區壽年氏、因作下列之談話、㈠敵軍於昨日（即前日）在江灣鎭與廟行鎭間作戰時、敵軍除有大尉一名名西尾勝六者、被我牛擒解後方詢問外、并斃敵軍第九師第一營營長百海實男一名、㈡當前日敵軍　重兵向廟行鎭與江灣鎭我軍某某師進攻時、我軍最前綫在兩沈宅·金穆宅·及户漾宅·各一連、當時因敵軍人數過衆、該一連人乃退至孟家宅一帶、敵軍大部隊、亦追至該處、并竭力猛衝、已越趙家宅至竹園墩、將規大塲、我軍於千鈞一髮之際、急調張災迎戰、除將敵軍大部隊完全擊退、奪回原有之防綫外、我軍最前綫、并追至鍾家宅、成爲侯家木橋起、沿鍾家宅·陶家灣·沿朱家橋東、折越淞滬路、繞萬國體育塲、至西體育會路與東、體育會路、至虹口公園之東面陣綫、㈢敵軍昨日（前日）進攻廟行鎭我軍口口師時、我軍伏於戰壕内、一槍不發、敵軍約百餘人、以爲我軍已退走、遂　深入、我軍待敵行近、即以手溜彈向敵轟擊、因將敵軍擊斃、無一生還、㈣敵軍戰鬭力薄弱故屢次被我軍所敗、然彼於潰敗後、能於最短時期、約可二十分鐘左右、集合一處、仍組成軍隊作戰、此則頗可贊美、敵軍尤有一佳點、爲歐美各國軍隊所難能者、即敵軍不易爲人繳械、蓋彼必待其被殺而後可奪其槍械、非若歐戰時、常有繳械之事可比也、㈤敵軍鐵甲車多至日餘輛、作戰時、固不能視爲進攻之利器、然以之防守、則甚得利云云</p>

<p>敵從該處一次偷渡</p>
<p>昨日下午完全肅淸</p>
<p>一被拘逃脫者口述</p>
<p>日軍連日用重兵圍攻廟行鎭、結果均被我軍擊敗、死傷無數、廟行確在我軍手中、日軍從未越雷池一步、其相持點、係沿泗塘爲界、金穆宅附近被我包圍之日軍、刻已殲滅、該處仍由我軍駐守、敵軍宣傳各種風說、均係無稽之談、昨有自侯家木橋逃避來滬、者談日軍任前綫作戰情形、及駐在地甚詳、按　君（姓氏略）曾被日軍拘役五日、故一切情形備極詳確、茲將其所述各點照述如下、</p>
<h3 id="c12">日軍現在之陣地 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>日軍於二十日起、因進攻吳淞閘北不利、乃改移戰區、側重江灣、但又未得逞、乃於二十一日、突以重兵、由南泗塘河黑橋及西唐家橋、向泗塘方面進攻、該處河面甚闊、我軍早有防禦、故日軍歷次衝錢渡河、終未有成、然其損失已屬不賞、二十二日晚、我軍任金穆宅誘敵偷渡、待其偷渡上陸、將及半時、伏兵四起、突出圍擊、因此其後部即退回侯家木橋、所圍敵軍、當於二十一日晨、被我軍全部解决、日軍死傷者當任千人以上、二十三日午、日軍又派重兵一千餘人、仍從金穆宅偷渡、我軍仍不阻擊、沉着以待、因此又起第二次之激戰、廟行鎭我軍、同時亦調往作戰、經一日夜之肉搏、日軍傷亡過半、落水而死者無數、當於昨日下午一時、被我軍全部肅淸、故廟行鎭、日軍始終未曾到過一兵一卒、確在我軍手中、惟金穆宅曾有二次激戰、我軍均獲大勝、刻下日軍在泗塘以東、侯家木橋爲其最前線、西唐家橋爲其司令部、所謂天樂寺宅者、乃該處一帶之總稱、又名高境廟、現設車站、江灣車站迤北、均在我軍範圍以内、惟在金穆宅之南泗塘之東之白漾宅、已爲日軍砲火所燬、全村駛爲瓦礫場矣、</p>
<h3 id="c13">被敵拘役五日夜 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>當日軍擬向金穆宅進短時、全部日軍、均沿侯家木橋而過、其後方部隊、即駐紮於斯、並挨户搜索、凡遇男子、均令其出外、爲之日夜服役、余（客自稱）亦爲其中之一、每户糧食、均被取去見其猪羊、即殺而烤食、如有門户緊閉者、則用槍柄撬開、日夜不准閉户、如遇差遣、稍有猶豫、鞭撻立至、婦女則關閉室内、有時余等因無事可做、則令集坐一隅、不得動越一步、又因糧食被刦、因此終日不得果腹者、三四日、飢寒交迫、痛苦萬狀、直至今日、（二十四日）日軍被我軍擊潰、全部向西唐家橋退却、我鎭（侯家木橋）變爲日軍最前線、乃始脫離險境逃回本埠、回憶前情、恍如隔</p>
<h3 id="c14">漢奸助虐反被殺 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>日軍在侯家木橋前線作戰、均利用僑居該鎭江北人作嚮導、該客民等均身穿日軍所發和服、出入民居、趾高氣掦、而對於同族、施虐尤甚一若非此不足以表示忠心於敵人者、其對余等、不時以命令式的指揮、口學東灜之語、余等雖明知其僞、但亦無法可施、某夜有一漢奸、自泗塘方面奔來　　向敵司令部報告、謂我軍正在渡河進攻、敵軍得訊後、即急派敵兵前進、詎進主泗塘乘岸時、不見我軍踪跡、疑爲中伏、亟向後退、早爲隔岸我軍所見、於是機關槍步槍齊發、敵兵傷亡二百餘人、事後、敵軍認爲誑報、即將該漢奸槍斃、賣國求榮、委身事敵者、以後得所殷鑑矣、</p>

<p>日軍現在侯家木橋者、其數不多、皆伏於田野土墳問、每於發槍後、即向後退縮、移避他處、若恐被我軍還擊者、其傷亡兵士、確用蔴袋装屍、由卡車載運、在二十三日間、敵軍因死亡過多、不及装運、乃將死屍放在村内、各户皆是、直至今晨（二十四日）尙未運完、由此可見日軍死亡總數、至少在三千人以上云、</p>

<p>結果均被我軍擊退</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Arrogant Will Surely Fail <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Bin</p>
<p>Arrogance is the mortal enemy of [victory] or [success]. In military affairs, arrogance is an even more terrifying term, because history tells us that [the arrogant] never prevail.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army decided to launch the first offensive shot against us on the night of January 28th, did they ever acknowledge that China had even half a man who dared to resist? That is why Shiozawa dared to issue a boast to the consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai, saying that "the Chinese army will surely be completely resolved within four hours." Moreover, he seemed to have no doubts about the realization of this boast, displaying a very arrogant demeanor. As expected, under the iron law of "the arrogant will surely fail," the curtain of war was raised, and the Japanese army was easily defeated several times.</p>
<p>After meeting with Stimson, the Japanese ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, told reporters from the Associated Press, "Vice Admiral Nomura is now going to Shanghai to play ball with Rear Admiral Tayner, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet. When the two leaders play ball, the two armies will also play ball." Recently, after the failures of Shiozawa and Nomura, Japanese warlords even said, "The 19th Route Army dares to resist because they have never known the majesty of the Imperial Japanese Army." This kind of arrogance and disregard for the perilous nature of war as child's play is strikingly similar to the story recorded in the Zuo Zhuan, where Chu Ziyu sent Men Bo to the Marquis of Jin to request battle, saying, "Please play with your gentlemen, and let the Marquis observe them by leaning on the carriage bar. Let De Chen and I feast our eyes on them." The Japanese, emboldened by their victories in the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, held their heads high and looked down on the world, setting sail to attack us with the ambition of certain victory. But in the end,] Commander Yi was repeatedly defeated. The so-called "four hours to completely resolve the Chinese army" boast became a laughingstock that made the world sneer. This is a recent example, an immediate and practical demonstration, of "the arrogant will surely fail."</p>
<p>However, this fact is precisely a valuable lesson for us. We should solemnly accept this lesson. Although we have achieved several victories, we must avoid becoming arrogant and unrestrained because of them. Our scientific military equipment and national strength are far inferior to those of others. The only things we can rely on are [justice], [courage], and [ardor]. We should prepare for a long and arduous bloody battle with a cautious and painstaking attitude, [maintain our determination and not be impulsive]. Only when [tyranny] has been laid to rest at the feet of [justice] can we burst out singing the [song of triumph].</p>
<p>Our countrymen must remember that [the arrogant will surely fail]. The arduous struggle has only just begun. Now is not the time for us to sing the song of triumph.</p>

<p>No Fierce Fighting Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The Great Fire Was Extinguished Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Japanese Army Launched a General Attack on Miaohang, but Was Severely Attacked Head-on by Our Army, and Surrounded More Than 2,000 Remaining Enemy Troops in the Jinmuzai Area. Late the Day Before Yesterday, More Than 5,000 Enemy Reinforcements Landed From the Zhanghuabang Area Under Cover of Night and Were Immediately Transported to the Front Line in Batches, Joining the Remaining Troops to Launch a Counterattack Against Our Army. Another Unit Was Sent From the Left and Right Wings to Harass Our Position. Although Our Army Fought Valiantly to Repel Them, About 1,000 of the Surrounded Enemy Troops Escaped. By One O'Clock Yesterday Afternoon, the Remaining Enemy Troops Had Been Completely Annihilated by Our Army. Yesterday, the Enemy Troops Were Exhausted and Did Not Dare to Launch a Large-Scale Attack. Only Small Units Wantonly Provoked. The Details Are Compiled as Follows.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Enemy Regimental Commander Killed <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army launched a general attack on Miaohang. Since the day before yesterday, our army has launched a fierce attack from Zhuqiaotou, and the Japanese army gradually retreated south to Tangjiazai, then to Jinmuzai Houjia Wooden Bridge. More than 2,000 remaining troops were surrounded there. At that time, most of the enemy troops had retreated far south of Houjia Wooden Bridge by ten miles. Upon hearing the alert, they gathered reinforcements and launched a counterattack with all their strength. Our army sent a detachment to meet them, separating the remaining enemy troops into two places. The intensity of the fierce battle was unprecedented in the Sino-Japanese Shanghai War. The Japanese army repeatedly attempted to launch a fierce charge, but was ultimately unable to succeed. From the night before last, they have been retreating step by step. The solution of the remaining troops is only a matter of time. Unexpectedly, 5,000 Japanese reinforcements who came to Shanghai had landed at Zhanghuabang and immediately separated to the front line and joined the battle. With this new force, the Japanese army immediately launched a counterattack with more than 40 tanks and divided into groups to harass our left and right wings. At this time, the number of front-line troops stationed by us was less than 5,000, facing more than 30,000 Japanese troops, and they had been fighting hard for dozens of hours, so they were contacted by the Japanese army, and more than 1,000 of the surrounded remnants broke out. At this time, although our soldiers were extremely tired, everyone was determined to die, so they still rushed to kill. One thousand encircled enemy troops were immediately annihilated, and the enemy troops were forced to retreat. They retreated more than ten miles south from Houjia Bridge. In this battle, our army fought more with less. Around Houjia Bridge, Japanese corpses piled up like mountains. Dozens of high-ranking enemy officers were also killed in battle. Yesterday, when our army was burying the remaining bones, they found that Baihai Shinano, the commander of the Second Regiment of the Ninth Division of the enemy, was also among the dead. This shows the intensity of the battle. Our army captured 24 enemy machine guns, more than 1,000 rifles, dozens of small steel cannons, and countless other spoils of war.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Enemy Retreats from Heijiazhai <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>After more than 5,000 enemy reinforcements landed at Zhanghuabang the night before last, in addition to sending a portion to help the remaining enemy in the Miaohang area, at about 5:00 yesterday morning, another thousand people were secretly dispatched from Zhanghuabang, hoping to reach Houjia Bridge from Heijiazhai, intending to harass our left wing and rescue the enemy. At that time, our army did not make a sound, allowing the enemy troops to go deep. However, when most of the enemy troops were about to arrive at Heijiazhai, our army jumped up and attacked their backs, inflicting a heavy blow on them. At that time, the garrison west of our Heijiazhai had also heard the alarm and rushed to participate in the battle, so the enemy was attacked from both sides. After a fierce battle that lasted for an hour and a half, more than half of the enemy troops were killed or injured, and they fled from Wen Dao.</p>
<h3 id="e6">105 Guns Obtained <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>At about 8:00 the night before last, more than 40 enemies, under the cover of intense artillery fire, attacked a certain village northeast of our Jiangwan Town. After our army fought bravely, more than 100 enemies were killed and more than 105 rifles were seized. The remaining enemies all collapsed and retreated.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Recovering Four Offices in the Fifth District <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, our army had previously abandoned the area of the Fourth Branch of the Fifth District of the Yinxianggang Public Security Bureau due to strategic considerations, which had been occupied by the Japanese army for a long time. Yesterday, it was recaptured by our army, and more than 100 enemy rifles and two portable machine guns left by the enemy army in the institute were obtained.</p>
<h3 id="e8">No Fierce Fighting Yesterday <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>After the enemy surrounded in Jinmuzai was completely resolved by our army at one o'clock yesterday morning, the enemy was exhausted, so there was no fierce fighting in Jiangwan yesterday afternoon. The enemy was based south of the Jiangwan Racecourse, and we were in the north. The enemy completely changed to a defensive position, and there were only skirmishes between sentries, with occasional intermittent gunshots and artillery fire. Also, the Da Mei Evening News reported that the Jiangwan front line was very quiet today (24th). Since the Japanese army's general offensive began on Saturday morning, the sound of artillery fire had been almost continuous for several days. Today, it was silent, and even the sound of machine guns and rifles was no longer heard. It is probably that both the Chinese and Japanese armies have been fighting fiercely for four days and need to rest. The commanders of both the Chinese and Japanese sides on the Jiangwan front admitted that there was no change today compared to yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e9">The Great Fire Was Extinguished Yesterday Morning <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Since Jiangwan was bombed by enemy aircraft the day before yesterday, fires broke out in various places in civilian houses and spread until 8:00 yesterday morning, when they were completely extinguished. The essence of the Jiangwan Town Main Street has been turned into scorched earth. The investigation is as follows: 1. The east market starts from the Wan'an Bridge on the main street and continues west to the Huayuan Alley. 2. Starting from the end of Xinshi Road, it burns north to the north alley of the main street. More than 100 shops have been burned, including Yongfeng Tobacco Paper Shop, Yan Dingmao Rice Shop, Yuan Yu Sauce Garden, Wan Sheng Sauce Garden, Yiwei Cloth Shop, and Lu Dingsen Flower Shop. It is still difficult to estimate the losses for a while. In the west head of Niulang Temple, four residents (one woman, two men) were killed by bullets.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Talk by District Commander <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter went to the front line in Zhabei and met the division commander, Ou Shounian, and made the following remarks: 1. When the enemy troops fought in Jiangwan Town and Miaohang Town yesterday (the day before yesterday), in addition to an enemy captain named Nishio Katsuro being captured and interrogated, Baihai Shinano, the battalion commander of the First Battalion of the Ninth Division of the enemy, was also killed. 2. When the enemy troops attacked a certain division of our army in Miaohang Town and Jiangwan Town the day before yesterday, our army's front line was in Liang Shenzhai, Jinmuzai, and Huyangzhai. At that time, because the number of enemy troops was too large, the company retreated to the Mengjiazai area. The main force of the enemy also chased to that place and rushed fiercely, crossing Zhaojiazai to Zhuyuandun, which was the biggest field. At the critical moment, our army urgently transferred Zhang Zai to meet the enemy, not only completely repelled the main force of the enemy, and took back the original line of defense, but also chased to Zhongjiazai on the front line of our army, becoming Houjia Wooden Bridge, along Zhongjiazai, Taojiawan, along the east of Zhuqiao, turned across Songhu Road, around the Wanguo Sports Field, to the east front of the West Sports Association Road and the East Sports Association Road, to the east side of Hongkou Park. 3. When the enemy troops attacked our army in Miaohang Town yesterday (the day before yesterday), our army ambushed in the trenches without firing a shot. About 100 enemy troops thought our army had retreated, so they went deep into the area. Our army waited for the enemy to approach, and then bombarded the enemy with hand grenades, killing the enemy and leaving no one alive. 4. The enemy's combat power is weak, so it has been repeatedly defeated by our army. However, after the defeat, it can gather in one place in the shortest time, about 20 minutes, and still form an army to fight. This is quite commendable. The enemy also has a good point that is difficult for the armies of European and American countries to achieve, that is, the enemy is not easy to be disarmed, because they must wait until they are killed before their weapons can be seized, which is not comparable to the disarming that often occurred in European wars. 5. The enemy has more than a hundred armored vehicles. During the battle, it cannot be regarded as a sharp weapon for offense, but it is very beneficial for defense.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Situation of the Battle in Jinmuzai <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The Enemy Secretly Crossed Once from There</p>
<p>Completely Cleared Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Narrated by a Detained Escapee</p>
<p>The Japanese army has been besieging Miaohang Town with heavy troops for days, but the result has been that they have been defeated by our army, with countless casualties. Miaohang is indeed in the hands of our army, and the Japanese army has never crossed the boundary. The point of confrontation is along the Sitang River as the boundary. The Japanese army surrounded by us near Jinmuzai has now been annihilated, and the area is still guarded by our army. The enemy's propaganda of various rumors is nonsense. Yesterday, someone who escaped from Houjia Wooden Bridge to Shanghai talked about the situation of the Japanese army fighting on the front line and being stationed there in great detail. According to Mr. (surname omitted), who was detained by the Japanese army for five days, all the circumstances are extremely detailed. The following points are described as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e12">The Current Position of the Japanese Army <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>From the 20th, because the Japanese army's attack on Wusong Zhabei was unfavorable, they changed the war zone and focused on Jiangwan, but they did not succeed. On the 21st, they suddenly launched a heavy attack from the South Sitang River Black Bridge and West Tangjia Bridge towards Sitang. The river surface there is very wide, and our army had long defended it, so the Japanese army's repeated attempts to cross the river were unsuccessful, but their losses were not small. On the evening of the 22nd, our army was responsible for luring the enemy to cross secretly at Jinmuzai. When they crossed the river and landed, and were about halfway there, ambushes rose up and attacked, so their rear retreated back to Houjia Wooden Bridge. The surrounded enemy troops were all resolved by our army on the morning of the 21st. The Japanese army suffered more than 1,000 casualties. At noon on the 23rd, the Japanese army again sent more than 1,000 heavy troops and secretly crossed from Jinmuzai again. Our army still did not stop them, but waited calmly, so there was a second fierce battle. Our army in Miaohang Town was also transferred to fight at the same time. After a day and night of hand-to-hand combat, more than half of the Japanese army was killed or injured, and countless people fell into the water and died. It was completely cleared by our army at one o'clock yesterday afternoon, so the Japanese army had never been to Miaohang Town at all, and it was indeed in the hands of our army. However, there were two fierce battles in Jinmuzai, and our army won great victories in both. At the moment, the Japanese army is east of Sitang, with Houjia Wooden Bridge as its front line and West Tangjia Bridge as its headquarters. The so-called Tianle Temple Residence is the general name of that area, also known as Gaojing Temple. A station is now set up there. North of Jiangwan Station is within our army's scope, but Baiyangzhai, south of Jinmuzai and east of Sitang, has been destroyed by Japanese artillery fire, and the entire village has been turned into a rubble field.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Detained by the Enemy for Five Days and Nights <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>When the Japanese army planned to attack Jinmuzai, all the Japanese troops passed along Houjia Wooden Bridge, and their rear troops were stationed here, searching from house to house. All men were ordered to go out and serve them day and night. I (the guest refers to himself) was also one of them. The food from each household was taken away, and when they saw their pigs and sheep, they were killed and roasted. If the doors were closed tightly, they were pried open with gun handles, and they were not allowed to close the doors day and night. If they were sent on errands and hesitated a little, they would be whipped immediately. Women were confined indoors. Sometimes, because we had nothing to do, we were ordered to sit in a corner and were not allowed to move a step. Also, because the food was robbed, we could not fill our stomachs all day long. For three or four days, we were hungry and cold, and in great pain, until today (the 24th), when the Japanese army was defeated by our army and retreated to West Tangjia Bridge. Our town (Houjia Wooden Bridge) became the front line of the Japanese army, and then we escaped from danger and returned to this port. Recalling the past, it was as if it were a different world.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Traitors Helped Abuse But Were Killed <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army used people from Jiangbei who lived in the town as guides in the Houjia Wooden Bridge front line. These guest people wore Japanese military-issued kimonos, entered and exited civilian houses, and were very arrogant, and they were especially abusive to their compatriots, as if this was the only way to show their loyalty to the enemy. They gave us commands in an ordering tone, learning Dongying's language. Although we knew they were fake, there was nothing we could do. One night, a traitor came running from the Sitang area to report to the enemy headquarters, saying that our army was crossing the river and attacking. After receiving the news, the enemy army immediately sent enemy soldiers forward. Unexpectedly, when they entered the Sitang shore, they did not see any trace of our army, suspected that they were ambushed, and hurriedly retreated. They were seen by our army on the opposite bank, so machine guns and rifles were fired together. More than 200 enemy soldiers were killed or injured. Afterwards, the enemy army believed that the report was false and shot the traitor. Those who sell the country for glory and commit themselves to the enemy will be warned in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e15">The Japanese Army's Retreat on the Battlefield <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army now in Houjia Wooden Bridge is not large in number. They are all lying in the fields and earthen graves. After each shot, they shrink back and move to another place, as if afraid of being counterattacked by our army. Their wounded soldiers were indeed packed in sacks and transported by trucks. Between the 23rd, the enemy army died too much, and they could not transport them in time, so they put the corpses in the village, each house was full of them. As of this morning (the 24th), they have not been completely transported, so it can be seen that the total number of Japanese deaths is at least 3,000.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Situation in Zhabei Yesterday <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>There Were Artillery Battles in the Morning and Evening</p>
<p>The Result Was That They Were All Repelled by Our Army</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were small contacts on the various defense lines in Zhabei. In the morning and evening, the Japanese army used artillery bombardment, and our army also returned fire. The artillery battle was very fierce. Yongxing Road was set on fire by enemy aircraft in the morning, and the flag was immediately extinguished. At Xinmin Road, Baoshan Road, more than a dozen Japanese troops sneaked in the morning and were attacked by our army from a high position with machine guns, and no one survived. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e17">Fierce Artillery Battle at Night <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>At 8:40 yesterday morning, the Japanese artillery position defending the east side of North Sichuan Road used exploding shells to fire at our army's position. The sound of artillery was loud and continuous. Our army did not return fire at first. After the Japanese artillery fired more than 30 rounds, it began to return fire. The artillery battle between the two sides gradually subsided until 11:00. At about 6:00 in the afternoon, the Japanese soldiers again used heavy artillery to bombard our Zhabei Baziqiao Tian'er'an Road defense line, and our army also returned fire. The sound of artillery was loud, and it became more and more dense. At about 10:00, the sentries of both sides also came into contact. Although the Japanese army used heavy artillery to cover the attack, our army's artillery fire was overwhelming, and the bullets were densely fired, giving the enemy a great blow. They were never successful. The Japanese army then used heavy artillery bombardment again, and our army returned fire again, and it gradually subsided until after 12:00. Our army's defense line has not changed.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Small Contact at Qingyun Bridge <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>At 9:15 yesterday morning, two Japanese fighters and one bomber flew from Hongkou to inspect our army's defense line at Qingyun Bridge in Zhabei and dropped three bombs, which were repelled by our army with anti-aircraft guns. At the same time, two or three hundred Japanese troops stationed in Shijin Alley, opposite Qingyun Bridge, suddenly jumped out of the trenches and fired machine guns at our army when the plane was circling over our position. Our army immediately fought across the river and fired hand grenades and hand-held machine guns at them. After about an hour of fighting, the enemy was defeated and retreated. In this battle, about 30 enemy soldiers were killed.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Enemy Sneak Attack Annihilated <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>At about 9:00 yesterday morning, about 20 remnants of the Japanese army suddenly emerged from the civilian houses on Xingjiazai Road and sneaked into Xinmin Road, but were seen by our army, who immediately opened fire. The enemy also returned fire against the wall. Our army on Baoshan Road heard the gunfire and came to chase them. Seeing this, the enemy took advantage of the situation to charge forward. Our army in Lai'anli fired machine guns from a high position and immediately annihilated them all. At this moment, our army is still searching for the remaining enemy troops.</p>
<h3 id="e20">No Fighting in Wusong Yesterday <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Only Came to Reconnoiter</p>
<p>No Bombs Were Dropped</p>
<p>The enemy warships outside Wusongkou were all anchored in the sea far away from our fortress yesterday. From morning to night, there were no special actions, and no artillery fire was fired. Only a few aircraft went to the sky over the fort and Wenzaobang to reconnoiter several times and then left, and no bombs were dropped. Our army also quietly guarded the defense line and did not fire. As for the enemy troops in Wenzaobang, they seemed to be on a truce. Our army also did not attack, so Wusong was very quiet yesterday. Also, according to the Da Mei Evening News, there was very little activity in Wusong on Monday and Tuesday. Today (24th) is still the same. Only Japanese naval and army aircraft flew high in the sky to conduct reconnaissance without dropping bombs. A special telegram from Jiangyin on the 23rd stated that the shipping news said that several Japanese ships were handling grain and rice in Chongming, and there was no sign of sailing downstream. The rumors of sailing to Cheng were inaccurate.</p>

<p>General Cai Vows to Obey the Central Government</p>
<p>Defending the Territory Is His Duty</p>
<p>Resisting to the End Regardless of Success or Failure</p>
<p>Western Newspaper Reporters All Praised Him</p>
<p>丨Small and Large Cameras Surrounded General Cai Yesterday丨</p>
<p>General Cai Tingkai, commander of the 19th Route Army, hosted foreign newspaper reporters at his military camp yesterday morning. More than 20 correspondents from British, American, German, and French newspapers stationed in Shanghai and reporters from various Western newspapers and news agencies in Shanghai attended. The meeting place was very quiet. When our reporter arrived, all the guests had gathered in the room. General Cai's interpreter said to the guests in English, "Ladies and gentlemen, are there any more questions you want to ask?" It was known that the guests had been detained for a long time, and there were female journalists among them. At this time, Mr. Cai faced the fireplace behind the wall, while the colleagues were surrounded by smoke, holding pencils and making records from time to time, and they were very focused. After about a quarter of an hour, the guests all went to the garden to rest for a while and have snacks. At this time, General Cai, who was famous at home and abroad, was surrounded by small and large cameras, and his words and smiles were all captured by the cameras. The host answered all questions, and the guests were very happy. And there were many questions that were very interesting. A reporter asked, where did Commander Cai receive his education? Mr. Cai replied, I have never studied. The questioner then said, Good, not studying can make a good general. The listeners smiled. Another gentleman asked Mr. Cai, does the general engage in other businesses besides military affairs? After the translator finished speaking, Mr. Cai smiled and replied, I focus on military affairs and have no time to engage in other businesses. Although such questions seem trivial, General Cai must listen carefully and answer them in detail. In addition, the questions and answers of the various reporters were recorded selectively as follows: (Question) How many years has the commander been in the military? (Answer) Nearly 20 years. (Question) When did you start in the military? (Answer) Eighteen years old. (Question) How many Chinese troops have died since the battle with Japan on the 28th? (Answer) About 2,000 people, but the number of civilians, women, and children who have lost their lives is no less than 6,000. (Question) It is said that Mr. Chiang Kai-shek has come to the front line to inspect. Is this true? (Answer) The current 19th Army is strong enough to resist the Japanese army, and Mr. Chiang does not need to come here to inspect. (Question) What is the relationship between the army and Mr. Chiang? (Answer) The 19th Route Army is an army under the jurisdiction of the central government, and Mr. Chiang is my superior. The army's duty is to obey, and there is no such thing as a relationship. (Question) How many soldiers are currently fighting on the front line? (Answer) About 140,000 people. (Question) It is said that there are German advisors in the Chinese army. Is this true? (Answer) Absolutely not. When the conversation came to this point, the Western newspaper reporters also asked why our army did not drive out the remaining Japanese troops in the concession. Commander Cai answered that we fight for justice and humanity and do not want to coat the essence of the concession area with artillery fire, so we have repeatedly tolerated the Japanese who rely on the concession to fight. Afterwards, the reporters again (asked) Japan will send heavy troops to Shanghai, will the general also have plans? (Answer) I am a soldier, and my responsibility is to defend the territory, resist to the end, and success or failure are not important. Our reporter also asked Commander Cai about the latest news from the front, and he replied as follows: The front line in Zhabei is continuing to make progress, and the Japanese troops surrounded by us in Miaohang will be resolved. (According to the front-line victory report when the reporter was writing the manuscript, the remaining enemy in Jinmuzai has already been cleared,) Last night (22nd), more than 100 Japanese troops rushed into our Jiangwan northern front line and were all annihilated by us without a single survivor, and more than 100 guns were seized. The reporter also asked about the death of American aviator Short in Suzhou. According to the answer, Mr. Short was delivering the [Bao Ling] aircraft that we purchased to China and had nothing to do with military affairs. There were no Chinese markings on the aircraft, and there were no military equipment such as machine guns and bombs. When he flew to Suzhou, he was suddenly surrounded by six Japanese aircraft. Mr. Short died in his duty, which is a pity. As for whether the Americans will negotiate with Japan, he could not answer. Yesterday, in addition to hosting the foreign guests, Commander Cai also invited the guests to visit our trenches and military facilities. Afterwards, the reporter asked a foreign newspaper reporter how he felt about this trip. A certain gentleman said, the Chinese army's trenches are so good that I have never seen before. Not to mention that the Japanese soldiers will not be able to capture them in a few weeks, even in a few years, I am afraid they will not be able to shake their defense line at all. This is an exaggeration, but the praise of our army can be said to be very complete.</p>

<p>Fierce Battle in Miaohangzhen Area Lasting All Day</p>
<p>Killing 2,763 Enemies</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army Headquarters yesterday (24th) at 10:00 AM released the (first) war bulletin: 1. Yesterday evening, more than a hundred enemies were killed northeast of Jiangwanzhen, and 109 rifles were seized. 2. Last night, our 61st Division seized three enemy water machine guns, one land machine gun, and ten rifles. 3. From 10:00 PM last night to the present, there has been no fierce fighting on any side, presumably the enemy is exhausted. 4. Because our army in Zhabei launched an attack on North Sichuan Road and Hongkou, the enemy fears that the residential areas of its expatriates will be occupied by our army, so it is now transferring a large number of troops from the front to defend North Sichuan Road and Hongkou. In the Jiangwan and Miaohangzhen areas, they are temporarily taking a defensive stance, waiting for reinforcements, etc. 5. Yesterday, the enemy civilian groups held a meeting and resolved that all those directly related to the battle would return to their country. 6. Yesterday (23rd) when enemy aircraft attacked Suzhou, an enemy aviation captain was shot dead by our forces. 7. Yesterday (23rd) an enemy bomber crashed and burned on takeoff due to carelessness. 8. The enemy government held a cabinet meeting yesterday to discuss reinforcements for Shanghai. Due to the issue of war expenses, there were many debates, and it ended without a result. Also, yesterday (24th) at 11:00 AM, the (second) war bulletin was released, and the battle situation of the 22nd and 23rd is now announced as follows: 1. Since the enemy launched a full-scale assault on our entire line with naval, land, and air forces on the 21st, attempting to break through our center in Jiangwan failed. On the 22nd, they launched another full-scale frontal assault on our Miaohangzhen position. Our troops dispatched teams from Mengjiazai and Nan Shenzhai to flank the enemy. The enemy used materials and stubbornly resisted, fighting fiercely all day. Both sides launched more than ten assaults, engaging in close combat. Blood and flesh flew everywhere, and the dead piled up. In the end, the enemy was completely repelled. In this battle, 2,763 enemies were killed, and even more were wounded.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 24th Dispatch: Zhang Zhizhong, Commander of the Fifth Army, telegraphed from the front to Nanjing on the morning of the 24th, stating that since the 20th, the army had been engaged in fierce battles with the enemy. The enemy used heavy artillery and aircraft to attack our front at Miaohangzhen, with extremely intense firepower. However, our officers and soldiers were exceptionally calm, and the Japanese pirates did not succeed at all. On the afternoon of the 21st, a seaplane was shot down, and the pilot died from bullet wounds. On the morning of the 22nd, the enemy launched another full-scale attack on our line at Miaohangzhen, and our army dealt a head-on blow, fighting fiercely all day, and completely defeating the enemy. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than 2,000 dead and wounded, and we also suffered some casualties, but morale is high, and all officers and soldiers are determined to die in order to achieve final victory.</p>

<p>Schutze was surprised when his commercial airplane</p>
<p>was shot down mid-flight by Japanese aircraft</p>
<p>The Japanese are even trying to protest to the United States</p>
<p>This matter concerns U.S.-Japan international relations</p>
<p>The future is uncertain</p>
<p>The American, Schutze, is a famous aviator. A few days ago, he was transporting a commercial airplane [Boeing] that our country ordered from the American Gale Company to China. When he flew to Suzhou on the afternoon of that day, six Japanese military aircraft suddenly surrounded him and attacked with machine guns. After the [Boeing] was hit, it immediately burned. Schutze died in the line of duty. According to investigations, this aircraft was entirely for commercial use and had nothing to do with the war. Therefore, it was not equipped with fighter capabilities. Furthermore, the exterior of the aircraft had no markings of our air force. The Japanese launched an attack, destroying both the man and the machine. This is extremely brutal. However, it is heard that the Japanese authorities not only do not admit their mistake but are also attempting to lodge a serious protest with the U.S. government. If that is the case, then their barbarity and unreasonableness can be said to be extreme.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government</p>
<h3 id="e26">Expresses to the Consular Corps Yesterday <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Repeated Protests and Serious Declarations Made Yesterday</p>
<p>Please Advise Nationals to Evacuate</p>
<p>Naval Vessels Should Not Anchor Near Japanese Military Bases</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government to the Consuls General and Consuls of various countries states: I am writing to you regarding the fact that Japanese troops are using the concession areas as bases for attacking Chinese troops. The Mayor has repeatedly sent letters to your Consul General/Consul, as well as the Consuls General of other countries, lodging serious protests. However, to date, although the concession authorities have expressed a willingness to maintain neutrality, no effective measures have been taken to stop the Japanese troops from undermining the neutrality of the concessions and endangering the lives and property of Chinese and foreign people. In recent days, Japanese reinforcements have repeatedly landed in Hongkou with the indulgence of the concession authorities, using it as a base for attacking Chinese troops. Even the Japanese flagship continues to be anchored near Hongkou, using the protection of the leased concession to issue orders to attack our country's military and civilians. Although it is clear that ships and other properties of various countries will be affected by military action, they do not care. The Mayor and the national military authorities are extremely concerned about the safety of the lives and property of Chinese and foreign people in the concessions. However, under these circumstances, the Mayor has no choice but to reiterate the protests and serious declarations. The national government will not be responsible for any consequences arising from the concession authorities' failure to prevent Japanese troops from using the concession areas as bases for attacking China. For the sake of safety, the Mayor requests your Consul General/Consul to instruct the nationals residing near the war zone or near Japanese military bases to evacuate and to inform your country's naval authorities not to moor naval vessels and other ships near Japanese military bases. We are writing to you for your information.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Municipal Government's Response to the American Consul <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Declaring the Locus of Responsibility. Yesterday, the Municipal Government received a letter from Consul General Cunningham, requesting that the business and shipping of all countries in Shanghai be maintained during the current crisis. The Municipal Government replied that since the outbreak of military action in Shanghai, the Chinese side has made every effort to maintain them. The impact suffered by all countries is due to the fact that Japanese troops are using the concessions as a base for attacking Chinese troops. The Municipal Government's reply and the American Consul's letter are recorded separately below: 1. Municipal Government's Reply: In response to your letter, regarding the great importance of Shanghai as a port in world trade relations, and requesting that all possible steps be taken to maintain the business and shipping of all countries during the current crisis, etc., We concur that the Mayor and the national authorities concerned, as well as your Consul General and the Consuls General of other countries, share the same aim of taking measures to maintain Shanghai's business and shipping. Therefore, since the outbreak of military action in Shanghai, the Chinese side has made every effort to maintain Shanghai's business and shipping. We believe that your Consul General is aware of this. However, it is found that Japanese troops are using the concession areas as bases for attacking Chinese troops, implementing their policy of aggression. The business and shipping of all countries in Shanghai have been greatly affected. This is indeed deeply regrettable for the national authorities. As for the locus of responsibility, the Mayor has made a clear declaration to your Consul General and representatives of friendly nations. In accordance with the letter, in addition to forwarding it to the relevant national authorities to continue taking measures to maintain Shanghai's business and shipping, we are writing to you for your information. 2. American Consul's Letter: I am writing to you, for the great importance of Shanghai as a port in world trade, the Consul General and my colleagues concerned earnestly wish to take any possible steps to maintain the business and shipping of all countries in the current crisis. My colleagues and the Consul General share this view and are convinced that the Chinese authorities in charge will be infinitely responsible for not interfering with the business and shipping of European and American countries in this port, now or in the future. We also hope that your Mayor will issue a declaration of the above meaning as proper and hope to receive a reply soon. Similar letters have been sent to the Japanese authorities concerned.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Japanese Military Rejects Foreign Reporters <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Due to Publication of Facts of Murder and Arson. Ta Lu Pao reports that the Japanese Consulate General suddenly notified various Western newspapers yesterday (23rd) that the passes issued by the Japanese Headquarters to reporters from various newspapers to pass through the front lines and headquarters have been temporarily suspended. The reason given was danger and disorder. However, Chinese General Cai Tingkai did the opposite of the Japanese and specially invited reporters from various newspapers to visit the front lines today. It is heard that the Japanese are deeply displeased because newspapers in this port have published the facts that the Japanese military's general offensive failed, that innocent Chinese civilians died miserably within the Japanese lines, and that Japanese soldiers often set fire to and burn the homes and property of farmers.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Account of a Tragic Massacre in Jiangwan <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Bodies Lay Everywhere on the Roads of Jiangwan</p>
<p>Women and Children Perish, Able-Bodied Men Arrested</p>
<p>A friend of mine accompanied a Western reporter to Jiangwan to inspect the area on the morning of the 23rd. Having witnessed the tragic state of the Japanese army massacring our compatriots, he returned and told the reporter in detail what he encountered, saying that there were almost no civilians left in Jiangwan. The brutality of the Japanese army can be seen. My friend said: "At 10:30 AM on the morning of the 23rd, I accompanied two Western reporters to the Japanese military positions in Jiangwan to inspect the situation. I was the driver, and another Chinese friend was my co-driver. When the car arrived in Jiangwan, we saw that the nearby civilian houses had already been completely burned down by the Japanese army, and five or six places were still burning. The flames soared into the sky, and the scene was extremely tragic. The bodies were arranged in a disorderly manner along the roadside, all of whom were the poor and helpless civilians of Jiangwan. Men, women, old and young, were all present. Some bodies were split in half, and some had their heads split open with brains overflowing. The tragic scene was unbearable to witness. Most of the women wore cloth skirts and lay dead by the roadside. From what I saw, there were more than 200 bodies. It is conceivable that the Japanese army was extremely cruel, and innocent civilians were poisoned. My heart was shaken. When I went to Jiangwan the day before yesterday (22nd), there was no such scene. I think the Japanese army committed this atrocity, massacring the civilians, definitely because they were ashamed and enraged by their惨败 the night before (22nd). The Jiangwan Forward Command of the Japanese army was originally located at Fudan University but was moved yesterday to a building opposite Guandi Temple in the northeast corner of the Jiangwan Racecourse. High-射炮 and machine guns are set up around it, and Japanese soldiers patrol back and forth with extremely strict vigilance. After we stopped the car in front of this gate, the two Western reporters entered to gather news and request war zone passports. At that time, my co-driver and I were both in the car and saw the Japanese army transporting things back and forth with unusual busyness. The vehicles and horses were even more crowded, and the faces of the soldiers showed a very flustered attitude. It is conceivable that the front-line defeat was indeed a reality. At the same time, bullets flew from the Chinese army's lines in the western section of the railway. The bullets brushed over the roof of the car, whistling. Thinking of escaping this dangerous area, I drove the car back and stopped about 100 yards from the command post. Half an hour later, my co-driver got out of the car to relieve himself. He had not walked a few steps when we suddenly heard him shout sharply, calling my name. The sound was trembling and out of control. Knowing that something unexpected had happened, I jumped out of the car and looked to see my friend being held away by three to five Japanese soldiers dozens of steps away. I was anxious and rushed forward, explaining to the Japanese soldiers repeatedly in English. The Japanese soldiers stared blankly and did not understand, and became even more angry. One soldier grabbed my collar and tried to arrest me as well. At this time, it was truly a moment of great danger. Fortunately, another Western reporter came out, whom I knew, so I shouted loudly for help. After his ten minutes of explanation, the two Western reporters who came with him also heard the sound and rushed over, pleading together. Only then did they agree to release us, but we were only allowed to stay in the car and not allowed to go out. So we got back in the car. According to the on-site investigation by the Western reporters, the civilian houses on the left and right of the command post were all burned down. Those civilians who did not have time to escape were killed or shot. None survived. Most of the Japanese army is still east of the railway, and only a small part that crossed the railway has been surrounded by our army. The Jiangwan Racecourse is still in the hands of the Japanese army, with many field artillery pieces placed there. While in the car, I saw more than 200 wheelbarrows, fully loaded with military supplies, running on the road. The drivers were all our suffering compatriots, with white circles painted on the backs of their clothes and a piece of white cloth wrapped around their arms. There were also special codes. I immediately asked about his experience of being captured by the Japanese army. The driver asked in return, "Are you a Japanese Chinese?" I said yes, and the driver burst into tears, saying, "We die if we work, and we die if we don't. It's simply hell on earth. We only get one meal of bread during the day, and dozens of people are detained in a lodging at night. Our arms are pinned against each other to prevent escape. We are very polite when we are needed and send soldiers to protect us, but we don't get a penny. When we are not needed or when there is a surplus of labor, they just kill us with a shot. It's extremely terrifying." While in the car, I waited until 4:10 PM, when the Japanese army's right wing was charging towards our army. From afar, I saw a large group of Japanese soldiers carrying about 100 or so dead and wounded Japanese soldiers slowly approaching. The Japanese army has repeatedly lied and tried to hide the dead and wounded, but today I witnessed it, and it can be known that the enemy's dead and wounded are numerous. According to general estimates, since the start of the war, the Japanese army's deaths must be at least 5,000. I returned to Shanghai at 2:20 PM."</p>
<h3 id="e30">Account of a Massacre of Villagers in Yinxiang Township <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>A Glimpse of the Japanese Soldiers' Brutality. A volunteer surnamed Zhu from a certain charity and his brother lived in the north end of Yinxiang Township, which was right in the war zone. Their families had already evacuated, leaving only the two brave men to take care of the house. However, they were always thinking of home while in Shanghai, so they risked going home to check it out for a week and then returned to Shanghai. A neighbor went with them. When they walked to the side of the Yinxiang Township Racecourse, they saw ninety-six Japanese soldiers arrest a villager, two middle-aged men, and an old man, with their hands tied behind their backs. They were forced to kneel on the ground on the north side of the racecourse. The Japanese soldiers fired their rifles and bayonets together, and the three Chinese men fell to the ground. They were immediately thrown into a nearby small river. The Zhu brothers and their companion dared not look directly at the scene and rushed forward, heading straight for the concession until they reached a safe place. They were finally relieved and told others about it. The Japanese are so brutal and inhumane.</p>
<p>Also, the No. 1 branch of the Deaf-Mute Vocational School on Jungong Road was bombarded by heavy artillery fire from the Japanese army at about 11 PM on the 22nd, with more than 20 shells. The entire factory buildings immediately caught fire and were destroyed after being hit, and two students, Zhou Yuquan and Jiang Hengkou, were burned to death. Although the east and west dormitories and the dining hall, etc., were not hit by fire, they have been damaged in many places. In addition, several shells landed on the playground but did not explode. The remaining students had been evacuated to the main campus in advance, so they did not suffer this disaster.</p>

<p>What the Western Police Station Saw and Reported. The North China Daily News reports that yesterday (23rd) the Western police in Hongkou witnessed Japanese sailors arrest seven Chinese passersby. It is believed that the number of those arrested but not seen by anyone is even greater. Of the two arrested, one was severely beaten. Also, at around 4:00 PM, an employee of the Mei Foo Oil Company was arrested. No one knows where he was taken. There were also a father and son who were arrested together. A certain plainclothes soldier searched a Chinese man another day and then handed him over to a Japanese sailor patrol team. Also, when a Chinese man was searched by a Japanese sailor, he asked a Western police chief for help. The Japanese soldier seemed to have put several pieces of paper in the Chinese man's pocket. The Western police chief, seeing this and feeling uneasy, stepped forward to intervene. A plainclothes Japanese soldier told him that he would report his actions to the headquarters.</p>
<p>Ta Lu Pao reports that the Japanese troops defending the Hongkou area continue to abuse Chinese civilians. It is impossible to count the number of Chinese who have been insulted by soldiers of the Marine Corps. Here are a few officially reported incidents to give a glimpse of the situation. Yesterday (23rd), an ambulance rescued three Chinese men and two women from a shed at the intersection of Ningguo Road and Huade Road. They were all shot and stabbed and were in critical condition. According to reports, this was done by Japanese soldiers defending nearby. At 9:00 PM the night before (22nd), a passerby heard their moans and reported it to the ambulance team. Also, an old man was rescued from the same place at 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon. He had been stabbed severely with a bayonet. Also, seven Chinese men were sent to the Harbin Police Station by patrolmen yesterday morning. They were all seriously injured, and some were about to become disabled. They were immediately sent to the Renji Hospital for treatment. Later, two young women with bullet and bayonet wounds were also found stumbling on Hongkou Road by patrolmen.

<p>Yesterday morning, the enemy continued to send large numbers of aircraft to fly over the front lines and drop bombs wantonly, venting their anger at the continuous defeats in recent days. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhabei. Starting at 8:00 AM yesterday, more than ten Japanese aircraft flew out from the Yangshupu area, divided into four teams, each team with three to five aircraft. They circled and reconnoitered in various parts of Zhabei for a week and flew towards the D场·Liuhang·Gujiatai area, dropping bombs. Wu Ashun, a 23-year-old tailor living in Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, who fled to a friend's house in the area, was also killed by the bombing. His wife, Wu Wang, was rescued by someone at 2:00 PM and was reportedly injured in her hands and feet and has been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Zhenru. Five enemy aircraft flew to Zhenru after 8:00 AM yesterday morning and circled in the sky for about a quarter of an hour to reconnoiter before flying southeast. When the enemy aircraft left Zhenru Station, they suddenly strafed with machine guns. Our army fired several shots with rifles and hand-held machine guns before the enemy aircraft scattered. At around 1:30 PM, two enemy aircraft returned to Zhenru and flew around for a moment before leaving. At around 1:00 PM, eight more enemy aircraft flew along the railway line and then dropped bombs west of Zhenru Station while simultaneously strafing downwards with machine guns. Fortunately, no one was injured, and they then went east, flying very high.</p>
<p>Central Committee Representatives Stationed in Shanghai Visited</p>
<h3 id="e34">the 19th Route Army Yesterday <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Central Committee Office stationed in Shanghai yesterday sent Kong Xiangxi, Xue Dubi, Fang Zhenwu, Fu Rulin, Chen Qingyun, and nine other Central Committee members as representatives, along with Gan Naiguang, Huang Jilu, and more than ten staff members, carrying 2,000 yuan in cash and 5,000 packs of cigarettes, to the front lines at 11:00 AM to express their appreciation. The reporter, hearing the news, joined them in the car. When departing, a staff member from the rear office led the way directly to a certain place to meet Commander Cai. Commander Cai lived in a small room filled with sandbags. A very sturdy cellar had also been dug nearby, presumably to avoid the aircraft's bombing. Commander Cai, hearing that the representatives had arrived, put on his coat and slippers. His attitude was leisurely, his spirit vigorous, and he came out with a smile to greet them, shaking hands with each representative and the reporter before entering the room together. After each person expressed their appreciation, they inquired about the recent battle situation and told him that they had heard that the Japanese side had suffered repeated defeats and planned to increase their troops by two or three divisions to launch a fierce battle in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Commander Cai Expressed That <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Increasing Japanese troops is not a concern. Since the Japanese created the incident on the 28th of last month, the number of troops on both sides has been equal, but the Japanese have been defeated in every battle. After the Japanese delivered an ultimatum to the Americans, they launched a large-scale general offensive, relying on the sharpness of their weapons to attack our positions fiercely, with the battle of Miaohangzhen Jiangwan on the night of the 21st being the most intense. In the battle of Miaohangzhen, the enemy's dead and wounded piled up, with two or three thousand bodies, which have not yet been completely buried. The Japanese suffered this disastrous defeat and, to preserve the reputation of their first-class power, increased their troops to assist in the battle in an attempt to succeed, which was within expectations. However, our side is determined to resist to the end, and no matter how rampant the enemy is in sending reinforcements, we will stand firm. However, the enemy has no reason to start the war, has been fighting in Shanghai for a month, has been repeatedly defeated, and has no fighting spirit, so it is not a concern. During the conversation, the sound of seven enemy aircraft approaching from afar was heard. Suddenly, the sound of high-射炮 and machine guns shooting at the enemy aircraft was heard. Commander Cai and the others immediately took shelter in the cellar. In the cellar, a reporter from the Far East Society inquired with a senior</p>

Mr. Hua replied that last night the enemy tried to attack Xiaochangmiao on the southeast side of Miaohangzhen. At that time, our army remained silent and did not fire a single shot. When the enemy approached our lines, our army rose up and strafed, killing more than 200 enemies and capturing more than 200 rifles. There was also contact in Jiangwan last night, and four enemy machine guns were seized. Miaohangzhen is still in our hands, and our army has made progress on the Zhabei Jiangwan front. On the 21st, we had already pursued deep into the Japanese lines, but because there was no danger to defend, we retreated to the original defenses. The battle situation this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) seemed a little quiet. Mr. Hua also said that he had captured a small squadron leader from the enemy side and asked why the Japanese army insisted on invading China. He actually said that it was because China was going to invade Japan, so Japan must first conquer China to avoid the danger of being invaded in return. It can be said that he was extremely ferocious. The squadron leader has now been transferred to the rear and temporarily accommodated. At 12:30 PM, the Japanese aircraft had already escaped. The reporter and the representatives extended their best wishes to General Cai to take care of himself at all times, said goodbye, and returned. Upon leaving, they saw more than 30 Western reporters and three Western women waiting to see Commander Cai. Commander Cai stepped out to greet them. The Western reporters removed their hats to show respect, shouted "General," and took photos one after another. Commander Cai, considering that it was very cold outside, welcomed them into the room. The reporter and the representatives drove back. The</p>

<p>is recorded below: Respectfully, this time, the Japanese寇 commit aggression against our land, causing resentment among all people and gods.

<h3 id="e39">Japanese Consul Makes False Reports <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Claiming to have Seized Poison Bullets During a Search of Plainclothes Teams. The North China Daily News reports that yesterday (23rd), the Japanese Consulate General issued a press release stating that the Japanese Consul General Murai sent small packets of Dum-Dum bullets to various consuls of the Consular Corps and the Secretary General of the League of Nations Investigation Team yesterday. These bullets were seized on the 14th of this month in the Chinese lines near the Siming Cemetery General Factory in the Baoshan District, and on the 4th of this month, the Japanese Navy seized them in Hua.In houses such as Songpuli (translated as Xi) on Baole'an Road and Wusong Road while searching plainclothes teams. On the 15th of this month, the Japanese Military Headquarters declared that the Japanese Navy and Army strictly prohibit the use of Dum-Dum bullets and will not use any poisonous gas in the war against the Chinese army. It is reported that the Japanese army used this type of poison bullet a few days ago, which was exposed by our country's newspapers. Now they are using this method of framing others to deny it. Their intention has been exposed by Ta Lu Pao. It is believed that the people of the world will not be fooled by them.</p>

<p>Departs this afternoon to take office. The Shanghai Times reports that the newly appointed Governor of the Philippines, Roosevelt, will visit the Zhabei Jiangwan front lines this morning (24th) after breakfast with U.S. Minister Johnson. In the afternoon, he will depart for Manila on the USS Taft to take office. Yesterday (23rd), when the USS Taft entered the port, Mr. Roosevelt and others saw black smoke filling the air in the Wusong area from the ship. Viewing it with binoculars, they saw some Chinese soldiers lying prone in the trenches outside the town, with good defenses. As for the Japanese soldiers, they were only seen when the ship passed Yangshupu.</p>
<p>Hurried Arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Japanese Reinforcements of 5,000 <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Mostly Reservists</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai Mostly in Plain Clothes</p>
<p>Mostly Disguised as Japanese Merchants and Civilians</p>
<p>Combat Capability Even Weaker</p>
<p>The Japanese Army's 9th Division, known as the nation's elite, has suffered repeated defeats since engaging in combat with our army in Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei on the 20th. Mountains of corpses have accumulated. A large batch of Japanese corpses, reportedly over a thousand bodies, was transported away yesterday morning by the transport ship Choyang Maru. The elite of the division have been lost, and Ueda urgently telegraphed Tokyo for help. While waiting for reinforcements, the Japanese government, upon hearing of the defeat in Shanghai, hastily assembled reservists and dispatched the 10th Division to Shanghai as reinforcements. However, due to the tense situation, it was difficult to dispatch the entire division. Furthermore, due to the difficulty of funding the deployment, they adopted a method of sending them in batches to Shanghai. On the 23rd, the Kasuga Maru and others loaded 5,000 Japanese soldiers, who were sent to the front lines immediately upon arriving in Shanghai, before they could even catch their breath. This shows the critical situation on the Japanese front. Yesterday, another batch of reinforcements arrived from Japan, transported by the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru and the Japanese Navy's 1st and 26th torpedo squadrons. The three ships arrived in Shanghai in three batches yesterday morning at 9:30 AM, 12:10 PM, and 2:15 PM, respectively. The three ships transported approximately 5,000 reinforcements. The soldiers on the two warships landed at Zhanghuabang, while the soldiers on the Nagasaki Maru landed at Huishan Wharf in the afternoon. According to eyewitnesses, most of the Japanese reinforcements who arrived yesterday were recently called-up reservists. When they landed, most were still wearing plain clothes and had to change into military uniforms after arriving in Shanghai, as they were hastily called up and boarded ships without waiting to change clothes or form units. Since the 10th Division consists mostly of reservists, their lack of combat capability is evident. Yesterday, upon arriving in Shanghai, they were forced to change into military uniforms and transported to the front lines by trucks. Many cannons were also transported along with them. It is said that another batch of reinforcements will arrive today, but the quality of the soldiers is even worse than before. Among the reservists being sent to Shanghai this time, many are Japanese merchants and civilians who have not engaged in exercises for a long time. They were forcibly conscripted by the government and sent to Shanghai to face the front lines. Therefore, the soldiers showed signs of distress and panic upon landing.</p>

<p>Flocking to the Japanese Consulate to Question</p>
<p>Advocating Temporarily Relocating to Manchuria to Conduct Business</p>
<p>In recent days, there have been important meetings at the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road, with lights burning brightly and not dispersing throughout the night. It is said that Japanese residents in Shanghai, due to the repeated reinforcements still suffering disastrous defeats, not only cannot guarantee the safety of Japanese residents, but also see their original businesses reduced to a state of irreversible ruin, with families broken and lives lost, causing immense suffering. They have flocked to the Japanese Consulate to question the situation, deeply feeling that the current fighting is a huge sacrifice with no value. They also question why, since China had previously painfully accepted various conditions, it is still necessary to conquer Shanghai by force. The consulate officials, faced with many people speaking at once, find it difficult to respond. A small number of Japanese residents advocate an immediate truce in Shanghai, with Japanese soldiers withdrawing to within the concessions. All Japanese residents remaining in Shanghai would temporarily relocate to Manchuria to conduct business, waiting for Shanghai's order to be restored and Chinese feelings to improve before considering returning to Shanghai.</p>

<p>The total number of Japanese residents in Shanghai is approximately 30,000, with about 17,000 men and about 14,000 women. Since the outbreak of the war, Japanese residents in the Hongkou area have been unable to live in peace. After the Japanese soldiers retreated the night before, stray bullets flew everywhere, and the situation was chaotic. The Japanese Consulate notified all residents that the elderly, weak, women, and children should all return to their country, while men between the ages of 16 and 40 must remain in Shanghai. The first batch of 9,000 people have already returned to their country. Yesterday, about 400 people returned on the Terukuni Maru. This morning, the Nagasaki Maru left the port, carrying over a thousand Japanese residents. In recent days, Japanese women and children in the Hongkou area have been carrying suitcases and baggage, clogging the roads with vehicles and horses, their faces dejected, and their situation extremely miserable. The remaining Japanese residents, because Hongkou has been designated as a safe zone, have left their homes and flocked to Huishan Wharf to seek temporary shelter, mostly hiding in various warehouses.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the British Consul-General's Office has mailed notices to all British residents in the city, instructing British women and children to immediately bring the bare minimum of necessary clothing and as much food as they can carry to assemble at the Shanghai Club upon receiving the second notice. However, it is stated that this second notice will only be issued in extremely urgent circumstances.</p>

<p>Carefully Care for Wounded Soldiers</p>
<p>A Wounded Soldier Died Unnaturally in a Certain Hospital</p>
<p>Doctors and Nurses Cannot Evade Responsibility</p>
<p>According to military authorities, the medical treatment of wounded soldiers provided by charitable organizations in this city is very enthusiastic and thorough. However, sometimes doctors are negligent due to being overburdened with tasks. It is said that recently, a wounded soldier with a bayonet wound in his abdomen, with a gash of several inches, was sewn up by a doctor after being admitted to the hospital, who said it was not a fatal wound. After treatment, the soldier was in good spirits and had no pain. However, in the middle of the night, the stitches suddenly broke. The nurse went to find a doctor, but could not find one for several hours. Later, the wounded soldier fainted and died due to excessive blood loss, which is very regrettable. It is hoped that all hospitals, doctors, and nurses will pay extra attention in the future, so that our wounded soldiers who defend the country and kill enemies will benefit greatly.</p>
<p>Please, Philanthropists,</p>

<p>Since the tyrannical Japanese recklessly provoked war, our valiant 19th Route Army soldiers have sworn to resist to the death, repeatedly defeating the stubborn enemy. As a result, many loyal and brave soldiers have been wounded. Hospitals are already insufficient to accommodate them due to too few houses, and it is necessary to expand them as soon as possible. However, temples are full of refugees, leaving the hardworking and meritorious wounded soldiers with nowhere to go. It is hoped that various guilds and private property owners in this city will temporarily lend their houses to the Red Cross to establish hospitals. It is believed that there is no shortage of philanthropists in Shanghai, and upon hearing this message, they will definitely enthusiastically vacate empty houses.</p>

<p>The defeated Japanese army, in desperation, plans to cross the concessions and attack our Zhenru area from Xicaojiadu and other places. This has been detected by our army. In addition to the municipal government sending a letter to the consular corps to stop the Japanese army from passing through the concessions, starting yesterday morning, our 19th Route Army ordered the 6th Detachment of the Public Security Bureau to prohibit the operation of ferries crossing the Suzhou Creek for refugees. At the same time, large barges were used to block the river at the New Rubbish Bridge, preventing any further boat traffic. Starting at 8:00 AM, all boats docked there were completely expelled and retreated from the警戒 area of the Suzhou Creek. All inland waterway ferries traveling to Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places have already changed to sailing on the outer river, so there is no obstruction to traffic with various places, while all rice, grain, vegetable boats can still bypass the South City area to reach Shanghai.</p>

In addition, although mail in the Yangshupu area is currently being delivered as usual, many residents have moved, and there are also many items that cannot be delivered. Therefore, the number of accumulated mail items in these areas is increasing every day. Another notice has been issued, urging people to quickly collect them from the administration and the Tilanqiao branch office, otherwise they will have to be returned to the original sending office based on the postmark.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhou Hecai, the respected father of Zhou Peizhen, the director of the Hangzhou Mint, who resides in Shanghai, passed away in his hometown of Xunxi on the 16th of this month at the age of 68. It is said that the day before his death, he still had his granddaughters read out the news of the war published in the Shenbao, and upon learning that our army had repeatedly fought and won, and were extremely brave, he was overcome with emotion. He took out 300 paper dollars from beside his pillow and instructed his family to quickly make silk cotton vests and send them to the soldiers at the front, saying that the survival of our country depends entirely on the desperate efforts of the soldiers at the front this time, otherwise the disaster of national subjugation is imminent. How can we comfortably spend this new year? Therefore, it is hoped that those who have the strength will contribute their strength, and those who have wealth will donate their wealth. If the whole country unites, we can surely drive the dwarfs out of the country and become a first-class nation. Because the family is busy with the funeral, they have already sent this amount to Mr. Wang Boqi of the Xinwenbao to be forwarded to the front-line generals.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Texaco Petroleum Company, saying: (omitted above) This time, in disregard of international conventions, it brazenly used brutal force to invade the territory of our city, launching aerial bombs and causing the prosperous city to fall into a state of terror. All countries that cherish peace cannot but think of ways to judge it. Although our two countries have not yet declared war, in principle, there is no absolute reason to prohibit the sale of military supplies. However, considering the actions of the Japanese in destroying world peace, and given that your company is located within the city's boundaries, for the sake of public justice, you should refuse this transaction. Moreover, the sale of your company's gasoline relies heavily on the market of our country. Losing the sympathy of the majority of our countrymen for the sake of a small amount of gasoline purchased by the Japanese for military use is not something your company would do when weighing the pros and cons. Therefore, this letter is specially written to urge you to take note and quickly stop the sale of this gasoline, so as to suppress the atmosphere of aggression.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Urging Landlords Not to Raise Prices Opportunistically <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce urges landlords in the city not to raise rents opportunistically. Yesterday, a public notice was issued, saying: Since the outbreak of war in the city, people in the Hongkou, Zhabei, and Wusong areas have been displaced and have fled to the concessions in hopes of avoiding the war. All of these circumstances are extremely pitiful. However, it is reported that some second-hand landlords and landlords who do not understand the big picture see this as an opportunity to profit, raising prices exorbitantly. The rent for even a small space is extremely high, more than double the usual price. This kind of behavior is close to gloating over misfortune, causing compatriots in the war zone to suffer not only the trampling of the Japanese invaders, but also the pain of having nowhere to turn. Citizens within our concessions who own property, try to put yourselves in their shoes, how can you feel at ease? As the saying goes, a sense of compassion is inherent in everyone. Therefore, this is specially published in the newspaper to urge all landlords who own property and second-hand landlords who sublet houses to rent out at the usual price, leaving a little room for the unfortunate compatriots in the war zone. This notice.</p>

<p>The transfer will be settled on the 26th of this month.

<p>A total drop of 58 taels in five days Yesterday (24th), the gold price hit a new low, dropping below the 600 tael mark. The decline was severe and unstoppable. The market was extremely panicked. Overseas silver markets and Shanghai foreign exchange markets were rising continuously. Trading on the trading floor was said to be lively, but chaotic and helpless. In the morning session alone, the price fluctuated by ten taels. There is a possibility of further declines. At 9:30 AM, the April opening price immediately fell 9 liang and 6 qian to 604 taels. The big bar rose another eighth, the US silver rose five-eighths, and HSBC listed a long position, calculated at 25 for British gold and half a yuan for US dollars. It is likely that the March US dollar can reach 35 yuan and 25 fen. Then it fell slightly to 602 taels. Zero-lot purchases increased slightly, adding one tael, but selling pressure was strong. It was said that companies such as Yuanmao, Yongyifeng, Yuantai, Zhifeng, Yongfutai, and Hengqianchang were selling off. HSBC sold to Zhejiang February British gold at 2 shillings and 25 thousandths. In just a few minutes, it plummeted ten taels, to 593 taels. After that, there were mutual fluctuations of one or two taels, and HSBC absorbed February US dollars at 125 thousandths. Citibank and Hejin entered May at 125 thousandths. Traders such as Dadechang and Yuantai Yongfutai Hengyuan bought in, and Chengfengyong and others shorted back, and then sold US dollars. Therefore, after 10 o'clock, it had exceeded 600 taels, reaching 03 taels at 10:20 AM. However, most retail investors were selling off, and US banks were doing 35 yuan and 25 fen for January, and HSBC sold February British gold at 2 shillings and 625 thousandths, causing a sharp drop of 6 taels and a half in an instant to 596 taels and 5 qian. After entering the market, short sellers and those who closed positions on the same day added over one tael. At 10:45 AM, the market closed, and the closing price was 98 taels and 2 qian, which was up 15 taels and 4 qian compared to the afternoon before. The price had fallen for five consecutive days, with a total drop of 58 taels. The highest price was 604 taels, and the lowest price was 593 taels, a fluctuation of eleven taels. The listed price was changed to 703 taels, a premium of 100 taels to 110 taels. The closing price was 105 taels, and the registered price was 97 taels to 98 taels. The makeup water was 97 taels, and the red bar was added 6 taels and a half. According to statistics, Dadechang, Kaitaism, Changyong, Yuancheng, and Yongjun made large purchases, while Yifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, Zhifeng, and Yongyifeng made large sales. Yuanmao, Yongyuan, and Tayuanda, Yongfutai, Yuhe, Hongkangyong, and others made both purchases and sales, but the volume was not strong.</p>

Stimson reaffirmed the US government's determination to maintain the Open Door Policy and equal opportunity in China, subtly criticizing Japan's actions in Manchuria and the Yangtze River basin as undermining the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Non-Aggression Pact. Stimson considered the organization of a new independent government in Manchuria as a direct violation of the principle of China's territorial and administrative integrity guaranteed by the Nine-Power Treaty, and stated that if the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact had been faithfully observed, the current situation in China would not have occurred.

The Japanese troops currently commanded by Ueda are insufficient to achieve this goal because the Japanese army is forced to fight on low-lying wetlands with crisscrossing ditches, and the soil is soft after the rain, which is unfavorable for combat. Therefore, it is necessary to send additional troops from the Japanese headquarters. Furthermore, the Japanese army is operating near the concessions, and all military actions must be extremely cautious, which is also a reason why it is difficult to succeed. However, Debuchi did not mention the number of reinforcements. According to officials at the Japanese Embassy, the number will be sufficient to cope with any situation that may arise. However, news received here from Tokyo indicates that the Japanese people and some military personnel are gradually realizing that their military is blindly advancing along a most dangerous path, engaging in risky ventures that will be difficult to escape from in the future. Their bankers have warned the government that if the expenditure on the Shanghai military continues unabated, the financial situation will become more exhausted and the financial situation will feel more difficult. Considering the current attitude of world opinion, Japan can no longer expect to borrow foreign debts. (23rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Vice Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army, Masaki, met with the Emperor yesterday at 6:30 PM to report on the unfavorable situation in the Shanghai war and requested reinforcement, which was approved. Furthermore, it was reported that Army Minister Araki reported at the cabinet meeting yesterday that Minister Shigemitsu in Shanghai and Commander Nomura had telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy Department requesting reinforcements, but Ueda's request for reinforcements had not yet been received. Given the seriousness of the Shanghai situation, it is absolutely necessary to dispatch reinforcements, and it must be done quickly. (24th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's dispatch of troops to Shanghai this time is said to be for the purpose of protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents. According to a question raised in the cabinet meeting on the 23rd of this month: 1. If the dispatch of troops to Shanghai is to protect overseas Chinese, why are Japanese residents in Shanghai returning to Japan in droves? 2. Japanese residents in Shanghai do not live in Zhabei. Why are Japanese troops fighting Chinese troops in Zhabei? 3. Japanese residents in Suzhou have already evacuated. Why are bombs being thrown there again? The above three points are requested to be explained by the authorities. When the official raised the above questions, he was prohibited from speaking. (24th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a telegram from Tokyo on the 23rd, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that Araki's proposal to increase troops was passed after dozens of hours of discussion at today's Japanese cabinet meeting, and orders have been issued for deployment. (24th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Seeking a Solution for the Shanghai Situation</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon suddenly departed for Geneva this afternoon, not wanting to delay any longer and miss the opportunity to be involved in world affairs. The new French Prime Minister, Tardieu, and Foreign Minister Grandi will both arrive in Geneva tomorrow. German Chancellor Brüning may also attend in person, and the chief representative of the United States to the Disarmament Conference is already in Geneva. Foreign Secretary Simon is carrying the well considered intentions of the British government. He believes that the first and most urgent issue at this meeting is the situation in the Far East. The British policy on this matter is aimed at a ceasefire. Britain is prepared to cooperate with the United States outside the League of Nations or with any country within the League of Nations, and the path it takes will always aim not to hinder the full execution of the League of Nations' duties. There is another major issue related to reparations and war debts. Britain believes that when discussing war debts with the United States, if Europe can agree on a deliberate and satisfactory reparations plan, the best results can be obtained. Britain will proceed with negotiations based on this view. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>President Hoover Receives Petition</p>
<p>(London) British Labor Party and trade union leaders issued a declaration today, urging all countries to sever economic and diplomatic relations with Japan to urge the Japanese government to cease military action in Shanghai. This document was jointly signed by the executive committees of the Trades Union Congress and the national executive committees of the Labor Party and the Parliamentary Labor Party, stating that it represents the collective opinion of British labor. The content suggests that member states of the League of Nations and signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact should all withdraw their ambassadors to Japan to force Japan to cease hostilities. If this warning still does not work, the British government is requested to propose an economic and financial severance with Japan at the League of Nations General Assembly. The document states that there is no doubt that China and Japan have entered a state of war, and it is equally clear that Japan should bear the responsibility for this. (23rd National Telegram)</p>

<p>Labor MP Urges Government to Make Important Statement</p>
<p>(London) During a meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Labor MP Mandle urged the government to send a message to the governments of China and Japan, announcing that Britain would not recognize any situation or agreement achieved in a manner that violates the League of Nations Charter or other treaty obligations. Undersecretary of State Eden stated that he believed that issuing such a note again would be of no benefit, that the government had already made its position clear, and that the Japanese government had earnestly guaranteed that it had no territorial ambitions and intended to maintain the Open Door Policy. Mendel asked if the government considered the relationship between China and Japan to be in a state of war. Eden replied that neither country had declared war at present, and the government's attitude would depend on future developments. Eden also answered questions about the new state in Manchuria, saying that according to the Nine-Power Treaty, the government seemed to have no reason to interfere, and that this was not the first time an independent state had been created within China, nor the first time a new state had been built with the protection of another country since the Nine-Power Treaty was drafted.

<p>Regarding Japan's Forcible Seizure of Manchurian Administration</p>
<p>Believed to be Trampling on the Washington Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<p>(Washington) The Chinese Embassy in Washington issued a declaration today regarding the establishment of a new state in Manchuria, stating that the three provinces of Northeast China, including Rehe, are an integral part of Chinese territory and absolutely cannot be separated. Although the area has been lost, China will never give up the work of recovering it. China considers Japan's forcible seizure of and interference in the administration of Manchuria to be a destruction of China's territorial integrity and a trampling on the provisions of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. Japan's establishment of a puppet government in Manchuria is a violation of all laws and conflicts with the obligations of the Japanese government under various international treaties.

<p>(Washington) Frank L. Buck, who claims to be a legal advisor to the Chinese government, accused US arms factories and bankers before the House Foreign Affairs Committee today of supporting Japan to the detriment of China. He said that arms worth $18.1 million had recently been sold to Japan with the support of bankers, while he could not obtain the same support for China. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to a telegram from the Baltimore Sun, the US State Department and the British and American governments have had informal discussions, resulting in an agreement not to allow Congress to discuss the sale of arms to China and Japan. The telegram stated that the House Foreign Affairs Committee has decided not to publicly discuss the proposal authorizing the President to ban arms exports to warring countries in the Far East, and the State Department will not disclose the number of US arms exports to Japan. The State Department's attitude has aroused much speculation here because the State Department previously expressed support for imposing economic pressure on Japan. News from Hopewell, Virginia, said that five ships loaded with saltpeter were about to sail to Japan. (Note: Saltpeter is a necessary raw material for manufacturing explosives.) It was also said that arms factories in France and Czechoslovakia were now selling large quantities of arms to Japan. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>League of Nations Will Issue Serious Warning</p>
<p>(London) The movement to declare its policy on Far Eastern affairs as [opposing procrastination] has, as recently expected, rapidly gained strength and has now spread throughout the labor community. Yesterday, the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, the National Executive Committee of the Labor Party, and the National Joint Council of the Parliamentary Labor Party decided to advocate the recall of diplomatic representatives stationed in Tokyo. Today, the Independent Labour Party followed suit, and more vehemently, even denounced the League of Nations as [capitalist]. It is believed that Foreign Secretary Simon has a clear plan for Far Eastern affairs, which is a sign of taking concrete action. If possible, it is planned to invite the United States to cooperate. Non-political circles now speculate that the League of Nations will soon issue a [serious warning]. According to The Times, this warning may prevent Japan from defying world opinion, but if it is ineffective, Great Britain will [take action]. All sectors of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party now advocate a decisive approach, namely recalling diplomatic representatives and implementing economic boycotts. However, those who generally advocate non-intervention still hope that the League of Nations Council can limit the scope of the actual war and prevent it from expanding. A certain diplomatic correspondent stated that in the future, if military decisions are not first agreed upon in Shanghai before taking diplomatic actions, whether by the League of Nations or the great powers, it will be more harmful than ineffective. However, the official admitted that the hope that a decision based on this approach can be reached soon has gradually diminished. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>

Kanai acknowledged that there were various difficulties in the creation of the new state, especially the bandit suppression and financial problems. He also said that the provincial government budget announced a few months ago would be strictly followed.

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>declared that it would not recognize it. On the 23rd, a formal protest was lodged with the Japanese ambassador, stating that recently, according to reports, there had been active preparations for so-called independence movements in various parts of the Northeast occupied by the Japanese army, and that when the League of Nations Administrative Council met on February 19, the Japanese representative Sato actually stated that Japan expressed considerable sympathy and support for the independence movement in the three northeastern provinces. The Chinese government officially declared on October 2 of last year that the Japanese government should be responsible for any illegal organizations in the areas until the Japanese army officially returns the occupied cities, and China would not recognize them. It has repeatedly lodged solemn protests with your country in the case. On September 27 of last year, Ding, Secretary of the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo, met with the Director of the Asian Bureau, Gu Gu, regarding the establishment of the Zhonghe State in the Eastern Province, and was told that Japanese participation had been strictly prohibited, otherwise they would be expelled from the country. Later, Ambassador Jiang also submitted a document to your government regarding the establishment of the state of Manchuria and Mongolia, stating that the Japanese government should be fully responsible for this before withdrawing its troops, and was replied that Japanese personnel were strictly prohibited from encouraging, supporting, or participating in the incitement of Chinese people to establish political power. However, the conspiracy of the so-called independence movement in the Eastern Province has become more obvious than before, and the Japanese representative Sato openly admitted that Japan supports this illegal movement. Such a violation of the declaration of your country's diplomatic authorities and the destruction of the integrity of the Chinese territory and administration, the Chinese government absolutely cannot recognize. The Japanese government should bear full responsibility for all actions to establish so-called independent or autonomous governments in the area and to order the Chinese people to participate in such puppet organizations after the Japanese army illegally occupied the northeastern regions. It is appropriate to re-lodge a serious protest and inform your Excellency, please check it. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Transportation Chen Fumu discussed the following: 1) Last year, the postal service suffered a deficit of seven million yuan, with over four million yuan being covered by the savings and remittance surplus. Currently, Postal Director Long Dafu has been assigned to work with the Shanghai Postal Bureau to increase prices to make up for the losses. For example, increasing the price of ordinary letters by one cent could generate an additional six million yuan annually. 2) The Zhenru International Radio Station is still unable to communicate with New York and London. An order has been issued for the radio station to purchase additional engines for direct commercial reporting. It is expected to be successful after February. 3) The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been transferred to the Ministry of Transportation. Reorganization measures have been drafted to sell off irrelevant business properties, pay off outstanding debts, and lease the remaining docks (excluding those for self-use) to foreign merchants. Furthermore, loans will be sought from foreign merchants to purchase dozens of new ships. The company's organization will be managed as a commercial entity, with a general manager appointed. A supervisory office will be established within the Ministry of Transportation. (Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>Simultaneously Remitting Funds to Support the 19th Route Army</p>
<p>Zhongshan County Takes the Lead in Purchasing Aircraft to Assist in the War</p>
<p>A dispatch from Guangzhou: As the Shanghai battle intensifies, various sectors and public organizations in Guangdong Province have been continuously remitting donations, totaling several million yuan, to support the soldiers of the 19th Route Army. In addition, chambers of commerce from Shantou, Chao'an, Jiangmen, Taishan, Nanhai, and other places have also remitted substantial sums of money to the 19th Route Army. Zhongshan County recently initiated a campaign to raise funds from the county's residents to purchase three aircraft to donate to our army for defense. As for the refugees in the Shanghai war zone, most of them are from Guangdong. Consequently, various parties have launched fundraising campaigns to raise substantial sums for relief efforts. It is reported that Zhongshan County has decided to allocate half of the donated funds raised throughout the county to assist in refugee relief, which will continue until all the Shanghai refugees have left the war zone. Subsequent donations will be entirely allocated to support the 19th Route Army. Yesterday, charitable organizations in Guangzhou convened a meeting at the Guangzhou Fangbian Hospital to organize the Shanghai War Refugee Relief Association, calling on all charities to assist in fundraising in the coming days. The board of directors of Fangbian Hospital has already advanced 10,000 yuan to be remitted to the Shanghai Guangzhao Guild Hall to provide emergency relief. In Hong Kong, the War Disaster Charitable Association was established on the 14th of this month. The business community has enthusiastically donated, and over 100,000 yuan has already been collected. Furthermore, overseas Chinese in Siam, upon hearing that the Shanghai refugees are suffering from cold and hunger, have also initiated a relief effort, purchasing over 20,000 dan of rice and planning to hire Hanyang ships to transport it to Shanghai for distribution. However, fearing accidents en route, they have entrusted the rice to the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong, acting in the name of the charitable community, to transport it to Shanghai for relief.

<h3 id="e159">The Situation in Martial Law Zhenjiang <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Government Employees' Salaries Suspended</p>
<p>Land and Water Defense Properly Arranged</p>
<p>The general situation in Zhenjiang recently, due to the Shanghai battle, is roughly as follows: 1) The provincial government, considering the urgency of the national crisis, is implementing austerity measures. In addition to layoffs, all employees' salaries have been suspended, with only living expenses being paid. Leave is not allowed. Military bands, martial arts schools, and police academies have all been suspended. Furthermore, famous people from all over the province have been hired to organize a self-defense committee to plan for provincial security. 2) Banks are operating as usual, but most money shops are still unwilling to open. Although there are market quotations, there is no trading. Yulong, Changkang, Yuanyi, Shenyuan, and other eight money shops have all been attacked. Most shops in the retail district have not officially opened. Business in silk fabrics and imported goods is even slower. 3) Trains arrive and depart at irregular times. Thousands of refugees arrive in Zhenjiang from Shanghai every day. The Red Swastika Society sends them to Jiangbei. Those who have no homes are sheltered by the Zhenjiang National Crisis Relief Association. Those who go to Jiangbei travel by automobile to Yangzhou, supporting the old and leading the young, in a very tragic scene. 4) Land and water defenses have been properly arranged. The provincial capital issued martial law on the 16th, with Li Mingyang as the commander. Traffic is cut off every night at 9:00 PM. The Japanese destroyer "Mochizuki" is anchored on the river. A few days ago, it made unreasonable demands to the provincial government over a minor matter but was not allowed. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau notified the ship of the martial law situation and asked them to pay attention. There are two Chinese gunboats, one American cruiser, the No. 222, and one British shallow water gunboat. 5) Residents of Zhenjiang and Yangzhou are enthusiastically supporting the 19th Route Army in the Shanghai battle. They have been purchasing various goods and transporting them to the front lines. One item alone, burlap bags, has already been transported out in over 10,000 pieces.</p>
