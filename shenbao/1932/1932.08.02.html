<p>時評</p>
<h3>商務印書館復業　彬</h3>
<p>一二八之變。商務印書館亦同羅浩刦。積三十六年慘淡經營　以臻於我國數一數二之文化機關。遭此茶毒。幾於不可再振。乃以該館盡力籌策。終能在國人熱烈期望之下。於一昨正式宣告復業。</p>
<p>該館復業之日。標懸極其悲壯之警惕語曰。［爲國難而犠牲。］［爲文化而奮鬥。］吾人但一低吟［爲國難而犠牲。］之句。則一二八之奇恥大辱。以及種種茶毒之慘狀。輒又歷歷浮現於吾人之腦際。此仇此恥。不僅爲直接蒙受絕大損失之商務印書館所不能忘。亦即爲我全民族所一日不忍忘。</p>
<p>吾人試再一吟味［爲文化而奮鬥］之句。輒又不能不深感該館奮鬥精神之堅忍卓越。旣爲國難而犠牲矣。更應爲國難而奮鬥。必我全國國民能具有此種奮鬥精神。而後當前之國難乃能打破。我民族乃能爭得自由獨立與生存。雖然。商務奮鬥之道究如何乎。吾人不敏。則亦謹願就見之所及。爲一借箸代籌。</p>
<p>商務三十六年來對於我國文化上之貢獻。固自有不可磨滅之偉績。而尤以近十年來之成效爲更多。但過去者旣已過去。刦後之商務。今旣以八月一日復業。則其［爲文化而奮鬥］亦當自八月一日而重新開頭。</p>
<p>吾人所願貢獻於商務當局者。</p>
<p>第一。我國今日文化之衰落。文盲之衆多。實爲世界所罕有。以故我國文化界今日之急務。不在於造成少數傑出之人才。不在於造成徒能讀洋八股之大學生。不在於遠稽往古。考證史蹟。以發揚我古民族之幽光。而在於掃盪文盲。敎育一般勞苦大衆。進一步更使下一代兒童不至再在愚昧與無知中長大。固然此種工作。要非文化界所能單獨負荷。尤非出版界所能單獨負荷。然而出版界於其出版書籍。多注意於敎育勞苦大衆。提高勞苦大衆之知識。提高一般水平綫。則以積久之努力。亦自可獲得驚人之成效。此吾人所貢獻於商務當局者一也。</p>
<p>次之。現代新學說與新思潮之流傳與推進。都惟出版界之介紹是賴。故出版界關係歷史文化進展與停滯。至鉅至深。人旣生而有思想之自由。則亦必應有研究之自由。任何主義。任何學說。任何思想。要皆有其産生之因。及其存在之價値。出版界則應不囿於主觀之見解。而應普遍介紹。俾國人得有自由研究之機會。此吾人所貢獻於商務當局者二也。</p>
<p>復次目前我國中小學敎科書籍。大抵都取給於商營之出版界。是則出版者之掌握中。實握有我全國中小學生之前途。換言之。即握有我民族之前途。</p>
<p>則其所負責任之重大。殆無可比倫。吾人認爲敎育靑年。應着重於養成其創造之精神。與開天闢地推進時代之生命力而不應養成書痴。或舊時代之承繼者。應養成其服務社會之精神。而不應養成其［利已主義］之幻夢。出版界編制敎科書籍。則應以此爲鵠的。此吾人所貢獻於商務當局者三也。</p>
<p>吾言旣盡。更敢取商務悲壯之詞爲商務勗。</p>
<p>［新商務其爲文化而奮鬥。］</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語錄</p>
<h3>海參威在那裏</h3>
<p>— 翰記</p>
<p>中國人性命不値錢，名譽不値錢，疆土更不値錢。近百年來，大好河山在糊裏糊塗中斷送的，不知多多少少！吾在咸豐六年間已讀外國書，對於地理知識也就知道一些，在那時已經知道黑龍江的北面是我們的，庫頁島也是我們的，吾還知道庫頁島上有一種特産叫做海龍，海龍的皮是很名貴的，那時庫頁島年年向中國進貢，海龍就是貢品中的特色。庫頁島的風土情形也很和中土不同，譬如在庫頁島耕田拉車，都是以鹿爲牛，這是在中國本部所看不見的。</p>
<p>現在熱河風雲緊急，吾就聯想到熱河，熱河是前清呈帝入夏避暑的勝地，熱河有圍塲，大如一府，專供皇帝馳騁射獵之用。咸豐十年，英法聯軍陷北京，是年八月，咸豐蒙塵，避難於熱河，暫由恭王出面當家，那時太監宫女隨行的很多，連宮女下體用的草紙也要由國庫支取，這是一件很醜的史料！</p>
<p>海參威被俄人拿去的時候，朝廷連海參威在那裏都不知道，總理衙門拍電報給各省督府，大家都無從奏覆，其時吾適在山東　口機器局當老總，山東督府來問吾，吾就將海參威的地點指示給他們，當時要找一張地圖都找不到，後來好容易在山東鄕下一個敎堂裏找到了一張地圖，你想，好大的中國，連地圖都没有，彌界都弄不清楚，經緯線都没有認清，如此糊塗，疆土自必朝不保幕了。</p>
<p>說起疆界和地圖，倒有兩件很有價値的史料。</p>
<h3>鄭洪年口中之謀事難</h3>
<p>— 石顔也</p>
<p>中國今日失業者之衆。在世界失業統計史上。實爲最高紀錄之一頁。以知識階級言。不惟薄有技能者。不獲噉飯之地。即在學生甚至東西洋遊學歸來。亦賦閒者比比然也。際此各校學年告終。畢業生千萬出校門。社會上乃又多千萬之失業者矣。國立曁南大學。本届畢業者甚衆。各生以其校長鄭洪年氏。有聲於時。所識達官貴人尤多。紛請爲覓職業。鄭氏慨然語之曰。今日之官塲。不宜入。亦不能入。蓋做官者皆爲吃飯而來。旣爲吃飯而做官。則其所爲。自以公事爲輕。以如何可以富足其個人生活爲重。且非爲彼一人之生活。彼之親戚友好亦皆不能生活者。故亦皆使之附已。爲之解决吃飯問題矣。官塲之飯旣盡果彼輩之腹。則尙想分我輩一杯羹乎。余之幼子。甫自新大陸歸。彼所研究者爲外交。擬於外交界中得一優越位置。以展其長。邀余設法。余乃函羅外長。旋獲復。幸不我却。惟僅一空空洞洞之外交部顧問職也。以余之所識者多。余子留學生之資格。所得僅如此。君等一大學生耳。尙何望乎。然請弗氣喪。余力之所及。必不負諸君也。此曁大畢業生之爲余言者。甚矣謀事之難。</p>
<h3>虎威可畏</h3>
<p>— 古呆</p>
<p>今夏天氣之熱。其最高度。竟爲天文台上之新紀錄。而其時日賡續之久</p>
<h3>夏日雜記</h3>
<p>— 啟宇</p>
<p>上海的夏天。到了晚間。馬路兩邊坐的盡是人。我們遠遠看去。只成了肉山肉海。成千成萬的扇子。不息的搖動著。現在一班摩登男女靑年。多半愛看香艷肉感的影片。那末。請他們不妨多來此地走走。旣肉感。又香艷。</p>
<p>在路上。我們時常可以看見。一個黃包車或是窮苦的人。蹬在地上。而皮死一般白。［哇！哇！］一陣陣的嘔吐。顯出霍亂的象徴。而對面的大厦紅樓上。却有一陣陣笑聲隨風吹過來。留聲機美妙的唱着I　love　you　love　you！</p>
<p>到了夏天晚間。人們最想找得一片清凈地納凉。可是偌大的一個上海。簡直没有一所良好的公園。可以供大衆棲息。中國所有的一兩個公園吧。簡直成一商塲。外國公園裏邊。又幾乎盡是外國兵。看了便使你有三分不高興。</p>
<p>。亦爲八年來所未有。致淞滬一隅。疫癘之盛。亦爲近數年來之所罕覩。情形慘怛。無以復加。爰敢筆述所見聞者。刋諸本談。我深望讀我文者。廣勸親朋隣友。速注防疫針。以資預防。其功德當遠勝於從事於慈善事業之贊助也。</p>
<p>余戚有居於西門關帝廟附近者、其女主人某女土。素不喜西醫。今歲滬戰之後。疫勢必盛。報紙上已屢載之。伊夫勸伊往衛生局注射防疫針。女土曰。余有生以來。未注防疫針。今且二十五歲矣。何必多此一舉乎。越一週。往戚家酬酢。歸而嘔瀉皆作。伊夫懼。擬送醫院，女士不欲。擬延醫診治。女土又固拒。遲延半日。</p>
<p>病勢轉劇。神智漸失。伊夫見勢不佳。乃急延醫救治。醫已束手。</p>
<p>西門西林路。有某姓婦。體素壯碩。料理家務。井然有條。一日。午飯。忽思食醬猪肉。購歸與夫共啖。飯後。渴甚。購氷汽水一瓶飲之。迄傍晚。覺微有不適。傾刻間。容色大變。白如紙灰。牙關緊閉。伊夫覩狀。驚惶失措。以指撥伊牙關。而謀灌以十滴水。詎牙關不爲所動。倉卒間。隨手以桌上銅羹匙撬之。不意羹匙爲婦所嚙斷。隨呑入腹。未一刻鐘。遽爾氣絕。逾三小時。胸腹尙溫。遺一女。生纔三月。慘極。</p>
<p>江灣鄕間某村。有老翁曰胡二者。與老妻子媳及二孫。結廬而居。兵燹之餘。生活本已極困苦。詎胡二之子。忽染虎疫卒。草草成殮。翌晨。胡二之次孫。亦染疫殇。迨夕胡二亦嘔瀉大作。黎明而亡。至午夜。胡二之長孫。亦繼而矢折。一家六口。三日之間。竟死其四。所存者。二代孤孀而已。且此二代孤孀。雖未死於日軍砲火。且倖逃於虎口之中。然而來日大難。衣食無以爲繼。亦殊可憫。此爲昨游江灣之所聞。述者與胡二爲毘鄰。諒所述當不誣也。</p>
<h3>今古不同</h3>
<p>— 金俊仁</p>
<p>友人語余。生活週報論文。有風馬牛主義之說。并命余試猜其意。余曰。是無他。風馬牛不相及耳。友曰。否否。昔人言風馬牛不相及。今人則風馬牛不可須臾離矣。友知余未讀該報。因即爲述其大意於下。</p>
<p>風者。出風頭也。馬者。拍馬屁也。牛者。吹牛皮也。意謂今人除出風頭。拍馬屁。吹牛皮外。一無所能。反而言之。苟善於出風頭。拍馬屁。吹牛皮。則處身立世之技倆。已概括無餘。不必更求所能也。</p>
<p>余待友言已。不覺爽然失笑。傾服作者靈心獨運。拾古人牙慧。作自已妙文。廢物利用。利莫逾於此焉。</p>
<p>試思今人出則車馬。居則夷樓。姬妾獻媚。奴厮侍奉。至於衣則夏葛冬裘之衣。食則五鯖八珍。軀殼之樂。眞非設想所能盡及。見之者嘖嘖稱美。羨慕不置。風頭可謂十足矣。然究其風頭之所由來。何一非拍馬屁。吹牛皮之功效也。今古不同。不同多矣。不謂千古不磨之文字。亦得隨時代而變化。不亦奇哉。</p>
<p>醫訊　醫學士劉君士弘。畢業於南洋醫科大大學。復往德日諸國各有名醫院見習有年。對於内科頗有心得。如肺腸胃腦神經等症。尤所見長。歸國後歷任國内各大醫院内科主任之職。凡遇疑難等症。一經劉君診治。無不立愈。如内人久患肺病。歷經中西醫士診視。雖愈時發。以病根未去也。自去歲經劉君針藥兼施。不一月而病愈根除。至今未發。大小女以身弱腦虧。讀書用功過度。神經上遂受剌激。因之久困二豎。屢治未痊。今亦爲劉君所診愈。於此益信劉君之學術經騐。確甚豐富。遠非一班徒鶩虚名者所可双儗焉。（劉君診所）現設法租界呂班路蒲柏坊二十一號（徐朗西）</p>
<h3>揚子江上的意象畫　（下）</h3>
<p>— 沙洲</p>
<p>（五）無理的停留</p>
<p>在國外。我們受外人的歧視與欺凌，已經是很可恥的事情，但是退一步想，那究竟是在　國，究竟還可少生一點氣，可是在自已國度裏要遭受外人的歧視，那就令人忍受不下了。</p>
<p>我們的船到九江時，整個的船廂裏，疾風暴雨一樣地流傳着一個使得多數有職務在身的旅客心底多添了一層憂急，而這消息終於成爲一個確切的事實，船將在九江停息一夜是决定的了。停船的理由是怪可笑的，却說船上乘着的四個西洋人，明兒要上牯嶺去避暑，到牯嶺當然要在九江離船，可是旣到九江，他們仍然不肯上陸，爲什麽呢？倒說天晚了，中國人開的旅舍是不願意住的，於是就要在船上再住一夜，而五百個以上的中國乘客的可貴的時間便做了他們四個人犠牲。</p>
<p>翌晨，時候已是八點，而船兒仍然没有開動的意思，這又是什麽理由呢？到說是四個上牯嶺的人正在用早餐呢，少間，還不開，因爲四者之一在ＷＣ呢。</p>
<p>滿船的客人全都憤憤然的了，</p>
<p>｜外國赤老充軍充到江西。</p>
<p>｜咱中國人眞不行。</p>
<p>如右的憤駡是隨處可以聽見，可是這又多怯弱而無益於實際喲！但我有什麽理由說那是怯</p>
<p>弱的呢？算了吧，要是自已不振作，那受一點外人的氣也没有什麽受不了吧。</p>
<p>（六）零碎的記事</p>
<p>日清公司輪船上没有中國乘客，這表示中國對日本人的憤恨，可是我們要拿同一的精神對付任何一國的輪船，否則，金錢不流入日本還是流到别國去！</p>
<p>揚子江兩岸的山嶺，以廬山最高。</p>
<p>黃石港在鄂東，風景絕好，該地産鐵，由日本人開採，中國自已的財富自已不去拿，這是使中國貧乏的最大原因。</p>
<p>揚子江是中國主要的脈胳，可是在這脈胳上看到點什麽呢？除掉浩淼的江水與聳高的册嶺之外，祇有飄懸着外國國旗的軍艦了。假如說中國是睡獅，那麽這眞的將［沉沉一睡五千年］嗎？（語錄汪精衛晋祠古柏詩）</p>
<h3>古廟敲鐘（六十二）</h3>
<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>六十九</p>
<p>這古廟工學團是佔據了我全部的思想。我吃過晚飯一個人在院子裏散步的時候古廟工學團又從我的腦海中的浮出來了。一忽兒，接二連三的來了許多疑問要求我解答··［把一個工塲呆板的當作一個一塲辦，那什麽意思？把一個學校呆板的當作一個學校辦，有什麽意思？把一個社會呆板的當作一個社會辦，有什麽意思？］大家怕要以我爲武斷吧？我的答案是··［呆板辦工塲，呆板的辦學校，呆板的幹社會工作都没有意思！因爲這樣的幹是割裂人生，使活的細胞解體、所以辦的人個個弄得焦頭欄額，找不着出路。劊子手的生活有什麽意義呀！你若是辦一個工塲，如果你同時注意到工作人之長進的機會和平等互助的關係便立刻變成一個有意義的工塲了。你若是辦一個學校，如果你同時注意到師生之生産的機會與平等互助的關係便立刻變成一個有意義的學校了。你若是在改造一個社會，如果你同時注意到各分子之生産與長進的機會便立刻變爲一個有意義的社會了。］我最後似乎是更加覺悟了。名字之改變究屬形式。如果辦、種事業是含有這三種意義，那末就稱牠爲學校也可，稱　爲工塲也可，稱　爲社會也可。倘使没有把這三種意義打成一片，雖是掛着工學團的招牌，便不啻是掛了羊頭賣狗肉。我想到興高彩烈的時候便一五一十的告訴了朱先生。他說··［你的推論果然不錯。工學團的意義而不是工學團的名字，會叫一切較久的人生集團變成富有意義的集團。古時的家庭差不多就是一個小小工學團。中國有幾支著名的軍隊是大規模的工學團。凡是較有永久性之集團，若没有工學團的意義包含在内，便變成了枯燥的生活而流於衰老。任何一種集團都不能呆板的辦。比如監獄，如果呆板的辦，便比地獄還不如。你想，如果全國的監獄都變成工學團，那是多麽富有意義的一件事呀！你再想一想，如果全國的家庭，商店，工廠，學堂，軍隊，鄕村，一個個都變成工學團！人人生産，人人長進，人人平等互助，人人自衛衛人！那末中華民國是變成何等莊嚴的一個國家呀！中華民族的新生命是在工學團的種了裏潛伏着。園丁們，普遍撒下去吧！］</p>

<h3>紗花紗市散漫之至</h3>
<p>棉紗市情平疲、形勢極其散漫、因市上實需停滯、各方均無動靜、致人氣渙散、但買方態度依然强昻、仍無放鬆之念、因各廠底貨枯涸之故、逢跌時仍購進、惟賣方以環境轉劣、現紗各埠需求缺乏、兼之日軍侵略熱河政策、仍在極積進行中、傾向抛賣、但國外花紗狀况、邇來較爲堅穩云、</p>
<h3>人標市塲買户稀少</h3>
<p>人標前市開盤、以上日報載不能抬高紗價之事、塲中　　　疲、買户缺乏、各月跌六·七錢、二三盤又回　　四錢、三收盤又回跌、結果各月跌三·四·五　　錢、成六統計四萬四千五百包、查賣出吉豐六百包、賡豐一千八百五十包、愼記六百五十包、信誠八丰五十包、德記五百包、明德五百包、買進益昶九百五十包、勞興七百五十包、裕康五百五十包、永昌八百包、泰興七百包、瑞大四百包、茲將收盤價分列如下、</p>

<h3>棉市稍稍前進</h3>
<p>棉市較硬、美棉立定、測其形勢、徐徐而漲、故本埠人心雖好、大部份觀跌、然底貨太枯、外棉堅昻、因之事實上目前難以下落、邇來天氣良好、新棉作進行尙順利、故空頭心思依然安定、前途情形、殊乏把握、</p>
<h3>鄭標多頭心氣硬化</h3>

<h3>現棉無去化</h3>

<h3>印英棉業週訊</h3>
<p>孟買棉收不佳趨堅　　利物浦現貨靜而期穩　　孟買上週市况堅定、日本及歐洲運輸商均無重要活動、歐洲及遠東之需要仍微、市價因美棉挺秀及本地棉收不佳而漲、現貨活潑、東方問訊平平、印度紗廠進胃不斷、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<p>市况堅定、</p>
<h3>糧食大風影響米市</h3>
<p>到頭不旺　　開盤見漲　　滬南　昨因浦江忽然起風、到頭寥寥、各帮銷塲甚殷、蘇常白破初則平穩、嗣得北市又起漲風、早間開盤各好二角、内頂中次貨上落有限、黎平白粳統提角許、買方態度因大月底已遇、來貨益稀、人心向上、早晚稻與洋杜尖一律提硬、新粳與昨相仿</p>
<p>新閘各路來源不多、市銷爽暢、常錫北粳買户尤湧、頂貨及中關各增二三角、早晚稻來源略稀、内地與轉口二帮略有動辦、價昻近角、洋杜尖貨色寥寥、價無上落、糯米雖呈堅穩、然有向上之勢、河廠各貨斛開三千石左右、</p>
<h3>寗紹帮暢辦陳小絞</h3>
<p>統市開出一萬五千包</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、又轉活潑、因寗紹帮固口突旺、天津帮續有試辦、再有内地本街之繼起購買、統市成交一萬五千包左右、人心極爲望好、但行情則以貨主意在急脫、不欲扳價、故所開之價與前市無大上落、惟骨裏帶俏、今明再有大批去化、則市價立可上展也、全日開小較四千包、價九元四角半至九元零八分、陳小絞八千包、價九元二角至九元零三分、紅小絞一千五百包、價八元三角半、西貢一號一各餘包、價十元零二角至十元零一角、天津帮辦去西貢五百包、寗紹帮去陳小絞八千包、其餘爲本街内地鄕莊分去、</p>
<h3>標粉發現强有力有漲風</h3>
<p>近期迫近二兩大關</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、復呈狂騰之象、初以洋麥報價曾小幾分及一二三角不等、本月份開價尙平、惟一開之後、因内地帮紛紛暢進、大　　之意見、以産地麥價騰貴、無錫報價至六元二角、蘇州包子至七元、較最低時已達一元餘之漲度、兼以大多頭之聲勢洶洶、各方注目、故盤盤提漲、甚爲猛烈、照此種景象、近期如非衝至二兩關口、尙無回頭之望也、津帮方面、昨亦成定兵船五萬、老車四萬、直送天津、價二兩零四分、（聞半數尙未配脫）觀察後步、非洋麥合拍、回勢頗難、結果本月較前月漲一分七厘半、九月份漲二分七厘半、十十一月份漲三下、十二月份漲二分七厘半、一月份初開二兩零一分、收盤亦較漲一分半云、</p>
<h3>期麥近堅遠平</h3>
<p>小麥交易疏淡　　昨期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈近堅遠平之象、本月份因客帮心思、堅挺異常、大致因内地麥價、亦跟縱蜂俏、現麥報價、較最低時、漲起一元左右、所以一致看高、買氣踴蹤、遠期因洋麥報價、微跌一二三角、交易雖暢、市暫平定、究因連日高漲、回頭也籠、故反軟弱、結果本月份較前月漲三分、九月份不動、十月至十二月份各小一分、現麥市面、交易甚稀、因貨中次、喊價尙平、開望仙橋麥三兩一錢六分、安亭麥三兩零八分、計四百十包云、</p>
<h3>小麥交割三十八車</h3>
<p>貨品江南北都有</p>

<h3>糖市粗砂白交易盛</h3>
<p>市價略見挫落　　昨日糖市公會市塲劃盤、交易尙見活潑、荷糖二十四號粗砂白成交價爲十四兩六錢、尙未完稅、由買方代行墊付稅銀者價爲十四兩四錢、成交頗盛、類皆囤户放出、行方吸取、交易二千餘袋、趨勢尙堅、太古糖Ｂ嘜十六兩四錢、ＨＸ嘜十五兩三錢、Ｈ嘜十二兩五錢半、進出不多、市况堅穩、號盤有仁記廠售開一號本廠冰百數包、</p>
<p>價元十五兩六錢、頗爲俏秀云、</p>
<h3>南北貨新榨菜到銷兩旺</h3>
<p>市面尙形堅穩</p>
<p>四川榨萎、今庚出産尙豐、茲値新貨登塲前後、到貨已達萬餘壇、高貨開過二十六元至二十五元、以次爲二十三元至二十二元、現各方銷胃尙屬活潑、查客貨未開者約有半數之譜、一時未肯過廉、行盤爲二十四五元至二十二元左右、市象平平、</p>
<h3>新衡蓮地價轉鬆</h3>
<p>甬粤兩帮去胃最健新衡蓮前批已有少數到申曾售六十一兩、茲續到數十件、價漸回跌、昨市行盤爲五十八兩、更據昨日漢口電訊、地價亦見回鬆、每砠已到三十五兩四錢、查前市爲三十七兩、聞申帮已辦入四十餘箱、不日又可到申、此間寗波廣東兩帮銷</p>
<p>塲最爲活動、後市當可暫定、</p>
<h3>絲茶洋莊絲經秋節停市</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊絲市、因江海關補行秋節封關、各洋行循例休假一日、絲經無市、國内絲織廠絲銷仍無生氣、廠經等均無成交云、</p>
<h3>浙建廳發售秋蠶種</h3>
<p>種價由廳核定俟售繭得欵付値　　消毒煖穩按户指導概不另收費浙江曾建設廳長、鑒於今歲所屬各蠶區農民、　育之春夏二蠶、内受天時損害、莫不大受虧蝕、農蠶經濟已瀕破産、現已决定救濟秋蠶辦法、選購優良秋蠶種、按户分售、種價由廳核定、俟售繭得欵付値、所有消毒煖種共育、派員挨户指導等事宜、由廳負責、一概不另收費、以濟農蠶云、</p>
<h3>珍眉綠茶歐銷大暢</h3>
<p>惟貢熙茶俄莊觀望</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市屯溪　縣遂安等路之珍眉綠茶、歐銷大起活動、銷茶廣大之恊和洋行、近兩日來、購進珍眉一項、爲數不下四五千箱、其他怡和·錦隆·天裕·各大英行、亦均羣起補進、市面異常熱閙、市價已趨堅漲、針眉·秀眉·珠茶·等項、去路亦頗爲活潑、惟貢熙一項、因俄莊觀望、市面仍無重大進展云</p>
<h3>玉山茶號尙未收塲</h3>
<p>贛屬玉山等路低莊茶　往年洋商銷胃甚滯、本年各行以徽屬婺屯高莊貨値過昻、運售無利、對低莊價廉之綠茶、進意轉濃、最近走銷尤暢、故玉邑茶號、擬於首二帮清售後、再行添辦新茶及子莊、蓋鉛玉兩邑茶樹生産、異於徽地、茶葉發育、有春夏秋三季、總之號方需要、山户可採供不竭、刻資本較充售盤較穩之茶號、收塲尙須有待、仍有加茶續做之勢、</p>
<h3>婺源存茶已售清</h3>
<p>此間北源各村新茶、因採製較遲、上市適滬市趨跌、本處茶號、對此都抑價靳買、山户初不料市面之久疲、多不願賤沽、故擱存二千餘擔、無人問津、迨本月初滬市轉機、山户迫於經價之窮蹙、始多願意早脫、號方亦以山價降低、成本輕减、咸樂多量進辦、兩旬來北源存貨、陸續開秤搜買一空、現所未廓清者、僅客販少數販茶、其中囤貨較多者、以購進成本高昻、與其跌價售與號方、寗自開製花色、運滬直售、刻已有數販實行接號自做、</p>
<h3>疋頭薄雨衣布市較堅挺</h3>
<p>天熱厚貨不動</p>
<p>昨星期一、呢絨同益會祗雨衣布稍有成交、其市面因久旱不雨、售價萎疲、昨四零二六頭號開水美售三兩七錢半、二號貨爲三兩五六錢、其薄貨銀格子象皮裏者、趨勢較優、售盤亦頗堅挺、昨頭號貨售三兩、普通如泰和、瑪達生牌子一律售二兩七錢七分半、因天氣炎熱、顧客多棄厚而選購薄貨、且到存不多、故得能保持其穩態也、</p>
<h3>五金靑鉛行情又跌二錢半</h3>
<p>走銷異常清淡</p>
<p>靑鉛行市、自茶帮止辦後、出路銳减、客帮交易最近因土鉛行情十分低廉、所以均不敢收辦、油漆公司·黃丹廠·以及錫紙廠·鉛字房等、或因銀根關係、因因存底豐厚、故均無力收進、以致市上成交十分冷落、標凖因環象不佳、致步步下游、昨是行情比前又跌二錢半、計每擔祇開十一兩、成交則異常蕭條、聞海外定價、最近合申市祇須十兩光景、是以標準一節、一時不易見好也</p>
<h3>小分釘貨少市挺</h3>
<p>長江帮去胃不弱</p>
<p>小分釘最近存貨依然寥寥、所以市價十分挺勃、計三分可估至十二兩五錢、四分十三兩、五分十二兩二錢半、六分十二兩四錢、聞客帮長江天津諸帮、均有採辦、而本街玻璃作亦俱有點綴云、</p>
<h3>黑鐵皮北帮已有問津</h3>
<p>貨價有起色希望</p>
<p>黑鐵皮爲秋冬兩季北路之繁銷品、惟今庚北路如天津·靑島·北平·諸帮、已多問津、預料其走場必較往年爲早、而市上空氣已有趨緊之象、一般同業均以爲行情前途、有高昇希望、所以互相抬大喝高、刻如二尺·六尺·十八張正號貨、要估九兩、副號貨八兩五錢、三尺·六張·三張·至六張貨、估八兩五錢、七張至十張售九兩、十一張以上至十三張開九兩五錢、冷門花色如十四張十五張則開十兩光景、查目下除三張四張以及九張十張有開出外、别貨祗有問訊而已、據市上調查、雖存底不少、但同業對於定貨、多裏足不前、是以行情有看好之望云、</p>
<h3>煤炭長興煤銷呆市疲</h3>
<p>長興烟煤、本埠去年銷路頗旺、而最近受日煤傾銷影響、去胃呈呆、除一部份之包廠家略有去路外、市塲絕無交易、故各堆棧存煤擁積、查共存現貨、約有七千餘噸之多、盤價因之低落、如　塊煤每噸現僅售八兩、煤屑六兩云、</p>

<p>本埠新聞</p>
<h3>昨日全市戒嚴</h3>
<p>華法交界全日斷絕交通　　各地稍有紛擾迄晚安謐　　昨日［八一］爲國際運動紀念日、（全世界無産階級反帝爭鬥節）全市特别戒嚴、華租交界鐵門緊闭、電車暫停、僅有數處、發生紛擾、茲紀詳情如後、</p>

<h3>各地紛擾</h3>
<p>昨日華租當局嚴禁集會游行、於是南市公共體育塲·滬西曹家渡·閘北梅園路等、反動份子預定集會、均爲制止、致未實行、上午六區警署區長張鳴欽、親自率領長警巡查、在白利南路凱旋路、查獲大批反動宣傳品、如［八一特刋］［八一反帝宣傳］［援助牛蘭宣言］［工報］等、滬東區韜朋路發現形如工人集會、當爲捕房驅散、下午閘北梅園路公共租界南京路、均發現形如工人學生者、散發傳單、當爲制止、僅獲大批反動宣傳品、入晚戒備甚嚴、安謐無事、</p>
<h3>目警防衛</h3>
<p>國聞社云、各國駐滬領事館、昨除日本總領事館派有大批日警防衛外、其他均無特殊形跡、</p>
<h3>日兵游巡</h3>
<p>華東社云、昨日爲八一紀念節、午後四時許、有日駐滬海軍司令左近司坐艦出雲號上水兵百餘名、列隊游巡、由西向東、沿外灘方面而去、頗爲一般人驚異、</p>
<h3>義公使昨訪宋</h3>
<p>張福運因海關事晋京</p>
<p>財政部長宋子文、連日召本埠銀錢界與財部直屬各機關領袖、商洽封鎖東北海關及軍費廢兩等問題、尙無確切辦法、昨日往宋宅訪謁者、有義大利公使齊亞訥·財政次長鄒琳等數人、至封鎖實行現尙無期、關務署長張福運、因封鎖東北海關事晋京、聞宋離滬期尙未定、</p>
<h3>林實延期返京</h3>
<p>因要公臨行中止</p>
<p>交部郵政司長林實、自來滬與黃乃樞局長會商後、對於東北封鎖後之郵政、均已商有辦法、林氏本定前晚晋京、因關於關外郵政問題、形勢又現緊張、故臨行又中止、展緩赴京、林於昨晨赴黃乃樞處、密談郵政問題、爲時頗久、據新聲社記者探悉、林氏定今明日返京、</p>
<h3>日發護照二百</h3>
<p>黃乃樞談、在遼瀋區之郵政人員、經郵務長巴立地、再三向日方商議、請發護照、現已准許、惟祇發二百張、已令僞國發給、現在東北郵員之急須入關者有四五百人、</p>
<h3>嚴捕關外郵員</h3>
<p>關外郵務職工、雖已奉令停止辦公、然日方於强制接收後、督促原有郵政人員赴局辦公、否則即將嚴辦、日刻已通令郵政職工所寄寓之房主、速赴警署報告、俾得查捕云、</p>
<h3>天津出售日郵</h3>
<p>天津方面、最近日僑謀設郵便局益亟、昨日、據新聲社探悉、在津日僑、擬正式設置日郵便局、并發售日本郵票、日人之理由、謂爲日人通信便利計、不得不有此舉、記者以是往訪郵政局總務處長宋朱孟侯、據談、此事本局亦曾有非正式報告、如果有此事、則自當咨請爲交部提出抗議、</p>
<h3>吉黑郵員四散</h3>
<p>吉黑區之郵員、被日監視益嚴、當該處管理局奉令停辦後、日方即派警察多名赴哈、管理局及職工之公寓處所四面包圍、且强令郵政人員作工、惟該區郵員頗爲機警、早料到日方有此舉動、故於前一日、即四散他處、未被逮捕、現日人限令於三日内吉黑郵員赴局辦公、否則須依照僞國法令拘辦、因之各郵政員工甚爲驚恐、易名躱匿他處、且因分散之際、並無組織、故各不知在何處、有所參商云、</p>
<h3>郵工五十抵平</h3>
<p>郵政總局消息、遼瀋區郵務員工五十餘、現已平安脫險抵津、内多係下級人員、郵差達半數以上、郵務生等則係少數、郵政局方面、擬使若輩休息數日、驚魂定後、再予以工作、</p>
<h3>潘雲超抵滬</h3>
<p>談熱河事變眞相</p>
<p>中央委員潘雲超、此次由津至京、與朱霽靑委員接洽商助義勇軍事、業已接洽完竣、於昨日上午八時抵滬、旋即赴法租界友人處休息、并分訪朱慶瀾及各團體、新聲社記者聞訊後、即驅車往訪、承告以最近東北情形、茲錄如下、</p>
<h3>日方窘急</h3>
<p>潘氏云、東北各地義勇軍、因鹽於過去之缺乏聯絡組織、未能正面與日軍作戰、故專以游擊方法、以牽掣其活動、最近以來、努力從事於聯絡呼應之結果、已漸躋於一强有力之集團、祗俟彈械充足、靑紗帳起、便可予日軍以極大打擊、現日軍之在東北者、總數約在十五萬左右、其出没地點、仍不出於鐵道沿線、蓋日軍深恐鐵道一斷、彼之聯絡運輸、便虞窮謁、故不惜出死力以守之、然其智窮力謁、疲於奔命之窘態、業將完全暴露、</p>
<h3>襲擊朝陽</h3>

<h3>鐵路負責運輸法規基本原則</h3>
<p>（續）鄭寳照·</p>
<p>凡僅爲轉送貨物業務者、不得作爲公共運輸人論、蓋以法律之眼光而言、捷運公司由其代理人完成實際運輸業務、並收取運費、至於轉送人、並無收受運費之利益、在實際上亦未運輸貨物、根據此種分别、故前者爲公共運輸人、而後者非公共運輸人也、</p>
<p>一般法家、大都以爲臥車公司並非公共運輸人、其本身並未運送旅客、不過供給旅客安眼之設備耳、旅客向鐵路購票、鐵路用臥車公司之車輛、實際運客、故鐵路須負公共運輸人之責任、（十）保險人責任與行李運輸、按照普通規則、公共運輸人、並無應用客車運輸貨物之義務、但在實際上、運輸人往往已在相當規定、重　以内、担負運輸　客　人行李之義務、此項業務、不　認爲不收酬報、因其　費已在票價内包括、行李運輸、係貨物運輸之一部份、故所受之法律限制、亦須同在運輸人運輸行李之義務範圍以内、担負公共運輸人所有保險人之責任、對於行李之損失、須有責任、故何者可以作爲行李運輸、實爲解决行李運輸責任之前提、茲試詳述如下、（Ａ）關於個人便利及需要之物件、均可認爲行李運輸、凡旅客在旅行期間關係個人便利及需要之物件、均可認爲行李運輸、如超過此種便利及需要之分量及價値、則不得作爲行李、（Ｂ）凡關於旅客職業之物件、亦得認爲行李運輸、凡旅客所帶之物件、係其本身在職業上所必須應用之物件、例如木匠所帶之刀鋸、是萬一旅客所帶之此種物件、發生損失、運輸人須負保險人之責任、（Ｃ）商品不得作爲行李運輸、因爲普通情形、運輸人承認關於旅客便利及需要之物件、可照行李運輸、故對於超出此種範圍以外之物件、如欲按照行李報運、可以拒絕、祇好改爲貨運辦理或用客車運輸、另加特别運費、現在如有客人以一批物件、其中十九均係商品、交與鐵路作爲行李運輸、並未向路方宣佈内容之性質、則路方不負公共運輸人之責任、蓋鐵路在貨物之内容、如若揭曉以後、並不受承認商品作爲行李輸運之法律限制、故如若承運、並無保險人之責任、（Ｄ）性質顯明之貨物、凡旅客所交運貨物、其内容性質、極爲顯明、毫無隱藏情事、如若運輸人接收當爲行李運輸、則須負公共運輸人所有保險人之責任、蓋該項貨物並未魚目混珠、冒充行李、路方本可作爲貨物收價運輸、今旣失於疏忽、作爲行李運輸、則如有損害、自須與作爲貨運同樣負責、</p>
<p>（十一）保管權仍在所有人之手問題、前已詳述公共運輸人所以担負保險責任之理由、係因運輸人對於在運輸中之貨物、有絕對管理佔有之權以及所有人欲得路方錯誤證據之不可能、故凡運輸人未得客商委託、代爲實行管理及保管者、則不負保險人之責任、因此旅客隨身所帶物件、其保管及管理之權、均在已手、故如有損失、路</p>
<p>方不負責任、</p>
<p>（三）公共運輸人供給公平業務及徴收合理運價之責任、</p>
<p>茲試就普通法立塲申述公共運輸人之義務及責任如下、</p>
<p>（一）貨物之公平承運、運輸人對於任何客商、必須公平待遇、一視同仁、在普通法方面、亦認爲理所當然、設若某一運輸人一面拒絕甲方之貨物、一面無限制的承運乙方之貨物、則認爲非法行爲、蓋此種行爲、足以造成一方之特殊地位、助其壟斷專利之釀成、同時並足以危害其競爭</p>
<p>對方之事業、申言之、鐵路必須負責接運任何客商之貨物、所有承運及交付辦法、不得分别厚薄、稍有歧視、此種義務、乃是運輸人自動承當之天職、亦關於公用事業之必需政策、鐵路對於公衆之所以必須公平待遇、更因政府給予種種特權、所希望者正在此耳、</p>
<p>（二）車輛之公平供給、運輸人對於所有設備、均有公平分配之義務、如若背道而馳、則必釀成極嚴重之分歧待遇、蓋設若對於某寄貨人之車輛供給、則頗迅速、而其競爭對方所需之車輛、則被迫延候、是後者之有利市塲、勢必喪失、而具貨物亦將腐壤或發生其他重大損害、亦未可知、設若鐵路對於客商需要車輛之請求、業已允諾撥給若干、但届時迫於實際困難、不能如數供給、則該客商不得提出抗議、惟有以合理化之態度、通知鐵路、請其於可能範圍以内、極力從速撥給、並以不妨碍同一車站其他寄貨人在前已有之請求、及影響本路其他各段之營業爲原則、鐵路對於沿線各站之寄貨人、均須一律公平待遇、任何車站、換言之、亦可謂任何客商、均不得强迫鐵路不顧其他車站或客商之利益、而業於自身供給十足之便利、</p>

<h3>已有辦法</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>已有辦法四字，我耳朶裏最聽得進，因爲天下事獨怕無辦法，若已有辦法，就無問題，不過所謂有辦法者，是口頭上的有辦法，還是實際上的有辦法，因爲我見所謂有辦法者曾得到兩種印象。</p>
<p>前見某店營業不整，將要關門，於是債權者一聞消息，羣集索欠，店方表示，謂請諸君放心，我已有辦法，於最</p>
<p>短時間，必有以饜諸君之望，及至於當時間，早已關門大吉，宣告破産，諸債權者徘徊門外，毫無弄頭，只得委托律師，代爲追欠，此是已有辦法之一例也。又見馬路上幾位仁兄，摩拳擦掌，怒會嫉視，始而口角，繼而用武，結果甲勝而乙敗，乙毫無下塲，指手語甲曰，你留心些，今朝吃你的虧，决不放你過去，我自有辦法，請你小心些，此亦是已有辦法之一例也。</p>
<p>昨日我看見平政委會大會結果，謂對熱河軍事，已有辦法，我心疑焉。</p>

<h3>草木灰製碱法</h3>
<p>— 爾誠</p>
<p>在肥皂没有問世以前，鄕村婦女，都草大灰浸汁來洗濯衣服，確有去垢的能力，但是使用很不便利，現代科學昌明，考知草木灰之所以能除去垢汚，全由於草木灰中含有碱質，如炭酸鉀Ｐotassium　Carbonate　（M2CO3）之類，爲工業家及家用之主要去垢原料，又爲製苛性加里之基本原料，此種碱類，可自草木灰中提取之，今將此法錄之於下，是亦廢物利用之一法也。</p>
<p>原料—稻草林灰</p>
<p>製法—我們要製碱，第一要選擇原料，雖然各草木灰中都含有鉀的成分，然而所含的分量不同，大概草灰含鉀的成分較多於木灰，又樹皮灰較多於樹幹灰，故用草灰來製碱，最爲妥當，不過更須注意的，就是草木一經完全燒透，其灰變爲白色，其中含鉀的分量亦就損失了，故最好取未完全燒透帶黑色的稻草灰爲最佳，原料之選擇已定，即可預備製造之用。</p>
<p>先將木桶一只，底部旁邊開一孔，用軟木塞塞住，底旁舖以二三層稀布，然後將草木灰放入桶内，用清水浸一日夜，初須漸漸攪動，後則聽其靜置，然後將木塞拔去，則液自孔内流出，渣滓留於桶内，可作肥料之用，將此流出之灰質置於鍋内，用文火加熱，待水分蒸發，視鍋内水分减少，可再加入灰汁，如此漸漸蒸發，鍋内液體漸趨濃厚，即可用碗取出少許放冷，視已能凝結，則將鍋離火，放冷，則見有黃色之粗碱結成，此黃色粗碱，很不純粹，最好精製之，精製之法，可將粗碱用清水化開，徐徐攪動，放置一二日，取上面之澄清液如前法煮之，則見有白色純粹之碱質析出。</p>

<h3>我所知道的一位摩登女子</h3>
<p>— 紹光</p>
<p>在我所知道的幾位女朋友當中使我印象最深刻的，却只有一位王小姐，的確，牠眞不愧是個十足摩登化的現代女子，可是好每在人面前說··［我是現代潮流激盪中一位代表摩登而又藝術化的女子，］所以我對於她亦只好名之曰摩登而又藝術（？）化的女性，她是上海的産物，爲其是上海的出産品，以故摩登才能十足，藝術，若站在非眞正藝術的立塲上說，亦可稱之曰完全。</p>
<p>那末，王小姐她是怎樣的摩登呢？—藝術化實在是談不上｜是的，只要你曾經和她見過一次面的話，—假若你不是瞎在話四－那你一定要驚奇叫絕了，她的面龐塗抺得像朶玫瑰那般鮮艷，嫵媚，兩顆水晶晶的眼球，靈活，流動得象花蕊裸的清澈的露珠，野菱似的嘴唇上，像是被誰剌了一刀似的在幌顫着血色的紅，眉毛畫得宛若柳葉般生動醉人，她那挺起的乳峯，輕皺的柔腰，靑絲的黑髮，燙得像麻雀窠似的神奇，養得像白玉般的手指上，戴着那價値千金的鑽戒，一雙五六寸長的肉脚，套進那走起路來發出的得的得聲響的高跟皮鞋，其他如珍珠耳環，金手錶，金手鐲，白金項練····應有盡有，她住的是洋樓，穿的是花樣翻新的舶來品，吃的是海味珍饈，她每天的工作，除了畫眉，擦粉·點唇，燙髮，散香水，修指甲，···外，便是伴情人在公園裏談天玩笑，或香檳尊前蜜語甜言，狂歡自得，或跳舞塲　樓抱踊舞，或電影院裏狂吻陶醉，或游戯塲裏指東話西，或在大馬路上行汽車兜風，顯現着那摩登十足的神氣，再其次不是打撲克，馬將，便是賭骨牌，麻雀。</p>
<p>至於她讀書的目的，爲的是便於寫情書，讀性史，看化裝品的廣告，影戯的說明書，她口裏時常流蕩着的英語··是ILoveyouMydarling,KissDancingGoal····試問這樣的王小姐，那一點夠得上藝術化呢？可嘆！</p>
<p>其實在上海那些醉生夢死自命爲摩登的女子，誰又不是像王小姐一樣拆爛汚呢？我不知上海女子愛虚榮的心理將伊胡底呀！</p>
<h3>［阿彌陀佛］</h3>
<p>— 聞遠</p>
<p>［的，的，的··］電鈴不斷的響着。</p>
<p>［啥人，倪老爺弗在屋裏］當差的阿二看見門外站着的兩個和尙，不待他們間便回答了。</p>
<p>因爲王公館裏的客人，大都是豪客，或高官貴紳，在用人呢？他們通常都是很客氣的，而今天這起碼貨的當差阿二，却這樣神氣地說着，當然使得大家</p>
<p>在裏面的人有些驚訝了。</p>
<p>［外頭去看看嗎，阿是來了一個小　三，］愛講話的王媽，邊說邊走出來了。</p>
<p>［我們不是來化緣的，是來見你們太太的，因爲我們剛朝了四川峨嵋山來，帶得有點東西來春敬你們的，］那兩個和尙申明來意後，並用手推推門。</p>
<p>［原來是這兩個大法師，哎喲，長遠弗見哉呀，阿二儂瞎脫了眼睛，快些去開門呀，］王媽認清了來人後，一面駡着阿二，一面還特意走下石梯去迎接。</p>
<p>這兩位客人，進了那堂皇的客廳，坐在沙發上，放下了那手包着的東丁後</p>
<p>，與王媽在閒談着。</p>
<p>［阿喲，我到忘記請太太下來呀，］</p>
<p>王媽談了一半天話，才想起上樓去請主人。</p>
<p>在一陣東談西扯什麽佛，什麽廟，和四川的酆都城等等，那兩位和尙年輕的一個，打開包袱，在經書中取出了一疊來着用油包的東西來。</p>
<p>［太太，這是頂好的雲土，在上海有錢也買不着，在四川賤來西，這一包一共有五十兩不到一點，］那年輕的和</p>
<p>尙揭開了油紙遞給那女主人看。</p>
<p>好，滿好，王媽在樓上枕頭下將那手提皮包落下來，］王太太用手折開了那厚疊東西，用鼻頭嗅過後、再拿手來試試重量如何。</p>
<p>［此地是一百五十元，把你們辛苦了，下次再請你們拿來呢，］王太太在手提皮包裏取了錢付給和尙。</p>
<p>［阿彌陀佛］！兩位和尙接了錢打着和掌像，向那平常的女施主一樣的頂禮。</p>
<p>［阿彌陀佛］阿二在替和尙開了門後，自言自語地在說。</p>
<p>生夢死</p>
<h3>醒後的回憶</h3>
<p>— 動心</p>
<p>有一件一給了我一個很深的印像，雖然事已經過去了，可是這件事經過的情形常常在我底腦子裏，像電影院裏的銀幕一樣的一幕一幕地映着。</p>
<p>我記得在去年的一天，我爲着父親的命令要到靜安寺路買點東西。當我跑到街上的時候，因爲落雨的緣故，我便在外灘跳上一路的電車。當我踏上電車的時候，我不禁口裏碱着··［卓兄許久没有見面了—］我那時很快樂，因爲我遇着一位許久没有見面的同學。當我還没有說完我的話，我不覺感着驚訝。他雖然面上表示快樂的樣子，可是心裏含着無數的悲哀和痛苦。</p>
<p>我記得他在五年前和我同級念書的，同級之中他的年紀算是最大。我還記得他常常穿上很漂亮的西裝，頭髮梳得很滑，而上抺着很厚的雪花膏，他每星期不過只上兩天課，其餘都在外面玩耍。同學們都知道他是校中最浪漫而最富麗的一人，他那時看見我後，便坐開了一點，讓了一個位給我，我覺得他和從前簡直是兩樣了，比從前瘦得很多。他那時只穿着一件很舊的黑布長衫，我就覺得他的環境已遇着很大的變遷。我問他近來怎樣，他搖了頭嘆了一口氣，便</p>
<p>開始說了··</p>
<p>［我嗎？我想你也知道了，你看我現在和從前已經是兩樣了。我想你還記得罷｜我從前和你同學的時候，同學們何等的羨慕我，以爲我家裏有很大的家産。呀我說出來你一定不相信，我實在告訴你，我母親從前在鄕下裏替人家做工的。］他說到這裏眼邊不覺發紅了，眼裏的淚也漸漸地澎漲了，我想安慰他，可是已經來不及了。他又嘆了一口氣便繼續地說··</p>
<p>［不過在學校的時候，我常常騙我母親賺來的錢。因爲我從少便没有父親，又没有兄弟姊妹。所以母親常常給我錢、我說怎樣她便怎樣。因此送我到上海來讀書，可是我抛棄一切，一點也不顧，走到浪子生涯路上去，違背了師長的敎訓，不要說我不能安慰母親，反而常常拿她用血汗換來的錢來浪費，抛到黑暗的地方去，呀我眞是一個大罪惡的人，這實令我懊悔令我悲傷。</p>
<p>可是母親去年已與世長辭了，我的生活上便感覺痛苦了，呀我是多麽的罪過呀！］他說完之後眼淚不斷地流着，最後我才知道他在一間工廠裏做工，每月不過十五元的薪金，靜安寺路到了，我便和他告别之後，我不覺流了點同情之淚。</p>
<p>車</p>
<h3>憂鬱的信</h3>
<p>— 思忠</p>
<p>未提筆前似有千情萬緒要訴，可是提起筆來時啊··叫我從那裏說起呢？</p>
<p>［人生呀，原是曇花一現！軀殼呀，原是滄海一粟！］我每想到這時，何</p>
<p>嘗不想，［及時行樂］，享受這黃金時代的幸福呢！可是［茫茫來日愁如海］！又不由得我引起愁思來了。</p>
<p>朋友！我雖然還未曾蹈入社會之途，雖然還未曾有麫包之魔向我作難。可是啊！有幾件事已經可以證明了我的命運，已經可以使我對於［人生之途］望風生畏！</p>
<p>以前，我記得曾經做過這樣的一個快樂之夢吧</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>［一個長滿了美麗的花草樹木底園裏··柳枝兒在輕輕地搖曳着她柔軟的細腰，雪白的銀杏，醉人的玉蘭，和那深</p>
<p>藏在葉蔓中的金銀藤，也都在輕捷地微笑··但是我是只愛那初開的玫瑰，爲的是她有醉醺了似的雙頰，爲的是她有那可以令人沁心的香氣。有了這樣的美景，再點綴着那晴朗的天空，溫暖的陽光，和那宛轉嬌啼似在向我顯媚的黃鶑，便完成了一幅［天空之樂園］的景象。］我只是在那裏徘徊，我只是在那裏享樂</p>
<p>，我只是在那裏沈醉··一切的道路呈現在我面前底只是光明，一切的東西映入我眼簾底都是快樂！</p>
<p>但是，這令人忘形的幻夢是不久的！那美麗的花園現在是荒蕪了··那顯媚的黃鶑是飛向别處去賣弄了··天空也不如從前那麽晴朗可愛，只是陰凄慘淡了。</p>
<p>每當我推想到將來的一切時，憂鬱的思潮便又蕩漾在我的心頭，水晶似的淚珠又要奪眶而出了。因爲我没有能力去復興這荒蕪了的花園，没有能力去剷除這滿路的荊棘，更没有能力去追求光明，創造幸福！</p>
<p>朋友！你看到了這封信，我猜你一定要來勸告我吧？說是··［不要消極，努力奮鬥！］但是，我的知友啊！這對於我是並不需要。因爲我自已早已知道，頽廢，抑鬱，悲哀，憂愁，都是能夠傷害我的心身，剝蝕我的生命的··不過乾涸了的湖，再也不能漾起美麗的漣綺··死灰了的心，再也不能狂熾起來的了。</p>
<p>我寫到這裏時，手是有些兒顫抖了，四肢只是一絲無力，眼眶裏是充滿着晶碧的淚珠，喉嚨間好像有什麽東西塞住了我只願大哭一頓。假使現在有一個人肯替我洒淚一滴同情之淚的話，那我眞是的是感激不盡了！</p>
<p>朋友！請你看着吧！不多日之以後，必定還有一件更使你不快的消息來吧！</p>
<p>這一封憂鬱的信、可以代表現在一般靑年的思想，他根本的錯誤、便是想及時行樂，亨受這黃金時代的幸福兩句，試問寫信的某君，現在是否行樂的時候呢？是否黃金的時代呢？請一般靑年曷一思之，編者誌·</p>

<h3>一個奇異的學會</h3>
<p>— 無懷女士</p>
<p>自從本届在某校畢業後，爲了沈悶和無聊的驅使，終日的想謀事做，有一天在報上找着了一條某學社聘請書記的廣告、就毅然决然的想去嘗試一下，可是在閱報的時候，我就生出了一個疑問，因爲旣是聘請書記，當然要以文體清雅爲主，爲什麽作品可以不看，祗要親去面洽就算呢，後來總因好奇心太重，就和一位同學前去了，</p>
<p>這機關是在一所Apartment内，辦公所僅有斗室之大，它住在最高層，當我敲門的時候，就有一位靑年出來開門，引我進去，寫了履歷和薪水畢，他很和緩對我說道，［錄取與否，你在最近幾天内就能知道了］當時我就很詫異的問道，［先生你還没有見到我的作品，怎樣就能判决你的選擇呢，］</p>
<p>他笑了一笑說［聘請書記，並不是一定要看作品的，祇要看他的面部就能知道這人思想的敏鈍了，］我聽了覺得越發奇怪了，心中暗自忖着，難道一人的智愚學問，都能在面部看得出嗎？那麽社會上一切的試騐都可免了，也可省了許多麻煩，［聰明面孔笨肚腸］的一句俗語，也應當没有了，但是他是智識界的人，也許不會說謊的吧。</p>
<p>我就在這樣滿佈驚疑的中間，和同學辭了出來，直到如今還覺得驚奇不止，唉這眞是一個神秘而奇異的學會啊。</p>

<h3>Business Press Resumes Operations 　Bin</h3>
<p>The January 28th Incident. The Business Press also suffered robbery and destruction. The painstaking management of thirty-six years finally established it as one of the top cultural institutions in our country. Suffering this catastrophe, it was nearly impossible to recover. However, the press exerted all efforts in planning and, under the fervent expectations of the nation, formally announced its resumption of operations yesterday.</p>
<p>On the day of the press's resumption, it displayed extremely tragic warning words: "[Sacrifice for the national crisis.]" "[Strive for culture.]" When we but softly chant the phrase "[Sacrifice for the national crisis,]" the extraordinary shame and humiliation of January 28th, along with the various tragic circumstances of the catastrophe, vividly reappear in our minds. This feud, this shame, is not only something that the Business Press, which directly suffered enormous losses, cannot forget, but also something that our entire nation cannot bear to forget for even a single day.</p>
<p>When we try to further savor the phrase "[Strive for culture,]" we cannot help but deeply feel the resilience and excellence of the press's fighting spirit. Having already sacrificed for the national crisis, it should strive even more for the national crisis. Only when the entire nation can possess this kind of fighting spirit can the current national crisis be overcome, and our nation can gain freedom, independence, and survival. However, how should the Business Press strive? We are not intelligent, but we are willing to offer some humble suggestions.</p>
<p>The Business Press's contributions to our nation's culture over the past thirty-six years have undoubtedly created indelible achievements, especially the accomplishments of the last ten years. However, the past is already past. Now that the Business Press has resumed operations on August 1st after the catastrophe, its "[striving for culture]" should also start anew from August 1st.</p>
<p>What we wish to contribute to the Business Press authorities:</p>
<p>First, the decline of our country's culture and the large number of illiterate people are rare in the world. Therefore, the urgent task of our country's cultural circles today is not to create a few outstanding talents, not to create university students who can only read foreign-style dogmatic essays, not to look back to the past and examine historical traces in order to promote the hidden glory of our ancient nation, but to eliminate illiteracy, educate the general working masses, and further ensure that the next generation of children will not grow up in ignorance and unknowing. Of course, this kind of work cannot be solely borne by the cultural circles, especially not by the publishing industry alone. However, if the publishing industry pays more attention to educating the working masses, raising the knowledge of the working masses, and raising the general level of knowledge in its published books, then, with long-term efforts, it can achieve amazing results. This is our first contribution to the Business Press authorities.</p>
<p>Secondly, the dissemination and advancement of modern new theories and new trends of thought all rely on the introduction by the publishing industry. Therefore, the publishing industry has a huge and profound relationship with the progress and stagnation of historical culture. Since people are born with the freedom of thought, they should also have the freedom of research. Any doctrine, any theory, any idea all have their reasons for their creation and their value for their existence. The publishing industry should not be limited by subjective opinions but should introduce them universally, so that the people can have the opportunity for free research. This is our second contribution to the Business Press authorities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the textbooks for primary and secondary schools in our country today are mostly supplied by commercial publishing houses. Therefore, the publishers hold the future of our country's primary and secondary school students in their hands. In other words, they hold the future of our nation.</p>
<p>Therefore, the magnitude of their responsibility is almost unparalleled. We believe that education for young people should focus on cultivating their spirit of creativity and the vitality to open up new horizons and promote the times, rather than cultivating bookworms or successors of the old era. It should cultivate their spirit of serving society, rather than cultivating the illusion of "selfishness." The publishing industry should take this as its goal when compiling textbooks. This is our third contribution to the Business Press authorities.</p>
<p>We have said all that we wanted to say and dare to take the tragic words of the Business Press to encourage the Business Press.</p>
<p>"May the new Business Press strive for culture."</p>

<h3>Three Thousand Guerrillas Surround Liaoyang</h3>
<p>Using Mortars to Bombard Japanese Troops, Fierce Fighting Ensues</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan is Safe, His Troops Scattered in Daqingshan</p>
<p>(Shenyang) On the morning of the 31st, guerrillas who planned to attack the South Manchuria Railway line on August 1st launched attacks on Liaoyang from all directions. By 9:30 PM that evening, the entire city of Liaoyang was completely surrounded by three thousand guerrillas. Starting at 10:00 PM, they began attacking the Liaoyang Attached Territory with mortars. The Japanese army engaged them in battle, and Shoushanpu was also completely surrounded by guerrillas. (31st Telecommunications Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Yesterday afternoon, two hundred guerrillas led by Da Shan, stationed at Dasheling, west of Liaoyang on the South Manchuria Railway line, burned down the wooden bridge on Liaozhong Street and approached the vicinity of Liaoyang, causing great disorder. Guerrillas concentrated at Shoushanpu south of Liaoyang, as well as those at Zhangtaizi and Yantai, responded to the call and began advancing. By 9:30 PM on the afternoon of the 31st, Liaoyang was completely surrounded by three thousand strong guerrillas. At 10:00 PM in the afternoon, they bombarded the attached territory with mortars. The first shell landed near the Chungryeoltap (Loyal Martyrs' Tower). The Japanese army then opened fire in response, adding intimidating artillery fire.

<h3>A Small Guerrilla Unit Attacks Xingcheng</h3>

<h3>Jinzhou Japanese Air Squadron Dispatched</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) At 9:00 AM on the 30th, the Japanese Aviation First Squadron in Jinzhou, led by Captain Fujii, dispatched four aircraft to scout and discovered that the guerrilla headquarters was located in Shenjiatai. They flew to bombard it. Patriot Aircraft No. 16, piloted by Captain Fujii, was shot by the enemy from the ground, damaging the oil tank. However, Captain Fujii was able to skillfully control the aircraft and return to the Jinzhou airfield. Furthermore, at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, four aircraft were organized to bombard the Guhe upstream area where the 48th Brigade of the Ting Guilin guerrilla force was stationed, inflicting heavy damage. (1st Telecommunications Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Red Spear Society Attacks Road Construction Team</h3>
<p>(Harbin) News tonight that 300 members of the Red Spear Society attacked the Chinese Eastern Railway construction team 45 miles east of Harbin. The team was protected by Japanese soldiers, but the Japanese soldiers and the construction team were dispersed, with many casualties. (31st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Attack Changchun Airfield</h3>
<p>(Changchun) At 3:00 AM this morning, approximately thirty guerrillas attacked the Changchun airfield, but were repelled by Japanese guards. The main force of the guerrillas, numbering around two thousand, is located in Guozuzi, east of Changchun. Today, there is a situation of attacking Changchun. The Japanese and Manchu authorities are on high alert. (1st Telecommunications Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changchun) At 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon, twenty anti-Manzhou soldiers appeared in Nanling and attacked the Japanese sentry post. Although they were quickly repelled by the guards, it is confirmed that nine hundred of these anti-Manzhou soldiers are concentrated east of Changchun, planning to attack Changchun. The Japanese and Manchu troops and the public security forces stationed in Changchun are now fully mobilized to strengthen the defense of Changchun and prevent their attack. (1st Telecommunications Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Ma's Troops Scattered in Daqingshan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wan Fulin said that someone came to Beiping from Taonan and met with Ma Zhanshan. Ma has recently scattered his troops in Daqingshan, where there are deep mountains, cutting them off from the outside world. The Japanese have a rumor that Ma died in battle, which is not credible. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Safe in Heilongjiang Province</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A reporter inquired with the Heilongjiang Province representative stationed in Beiping about the Japanese rumor of Ma Zhanshan's death in battle. According to reports, Ma is still in Suileng overseeing the troops and is in good health. There have been telegrams to Beiping from Heihe every day, proving that the Japanese reports have other intentions and are definitely not factual. (1st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>German Missionary Kidnapped in Wangqing</h3>
<p>Jian Dao. Today, it was heard that armed bandits attacked the Catholic Church in Beifangzi (transliteration), Wangqing County, and kidnapped the German pastor. He was only released after the parishioners paid the ransom demanded. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Continue Activities in Rehe Territory</h3>
<p>Rescue of Ishimoto Faces Twists and Turns</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese aircraft continue to operate in Rehe territory. The political circles here have not received a report from Tang Yulin, probably because of the poor transportation between Rehe and Chaoyang. It is now believed that Tang himself has not received the news of the Japanese aircraft bombardment. The Japanese authorities admit that Ishimoto was not detained by Tang Yulin's army, which is quite a relief to the authorities here. As for the conflict north of Yuguan, the political circles here have also not received news. It is said that this may be a conflict between the Japanese army and the guerrillas and is not important. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the situation in Rehe and Yuguan, political circles here claim that they have not received any news. However, the people are not alarmed. They believe that Japan's policy is to intimidate Tang Yulin and make Zhang Xueliang constantly suspect that Japan will take action in Rehe, and then attack and disturb the Tianjin-Beiping area. However, several foreign observers believe that the Japanese military authorities will definitely act soon, but it is impossible to predict when. Their intention is that the Japanese will probably only bombard the sky in the Rehe area, and their resolute actions will be carried out in the Tianjin-Beiping area. There are no signs of an immediate outbreak at the moment, but if another incident like the Ishimoto case occurs, or military actions are taken, it will be enough to trigger an incident. The Japanese Embassy's guards conducted a secret drill this morning, rushing through the busy Beiping Avenue, attacking the walls of the former Austrian Embassy with rifles, and shouting as they climbed the ladders, as if facing a formidable enemy. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Rehe issue is gradually becoming serious due to the Japanese military action, and Yuguan is also tense. Zhang Xueliang sent a telegram to Nanjing on the morning of the 1st, reporting the latest situation. (1st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The rescue of Ishimoto Yokoshiro was previously promising, and there was talk of his imminent release. However, the guerrillas suddenly presented the following conditions for the release to the Rehe army: (1) Provide the guerrillas with a large amount of ransom, (2) Incorporate the guerrillas into the regular army, (3) Provide the guerrillas with a certain territory. As a result, if the Rehe army accepts the guerrillas' demands, they will be in a situation of confronting the Japanese army together. If they refuse, the rescue of Ishimoto will inevitably be difficult. The position is quite painful. In short, the rescue of Ishimoto is temporarily hopeful.

<h3>Zhu Jiqing Reports on the Anti-Japanese Resistance of the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Yesterday Morning at the Central Memorial Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Committee Member Zhu Jiqing reported at the Central Memorial Week on the morning of the 1st. He first stated the main reasons why the Japanese warlords forcibly occupied the Eastern Provinces: (1) Domestic economic panic and corruption in parliamentary politics. Japanese warlords and demobilized soldiers took advantage of the people's psychology to form a fascist movement and carry out external aggression. (2) Soviet Russia extended its economic power in the Northeast, and the United States also had similar developments. In order to maintain special rights and prevent the United States and Russia, Japan did not hesitate to risk great injustice. (3) The construction of China's railway network in the Northeast, the construction of Huludao port, and the implementation of general industrial plans were completed in turn, posing a great threat to the South Manchuria Railway and Dalian, causing Japan's jealousy and leading it to adopt violent aggression. Zhu then said that after the September 18th Incident, the people of the Eastern Provinces initially believed that Japan would not occupy the territory for long and that the economy had not yet been destroyed and the order had not yet been disrupted, so there was no significant anti-Japanese movement, and they waited for a peaceful resolution. However, at the same time, Japanese merchants and students believed that Manchuria was their eternal paradise and mobilized to help the Japanese warlords' atrocities. After the Japanese army occupied the Northeast, it first robbed financial and transportation institutions, confiscated firearms and weapons, expelled and massacred intellectuals, and established puppet organizations for its use, transplanted Japanese and Korean farmers, and forcibly occupied land. The people of the Northeast, due to the crisis of life and survival, aroused national consciousness and are now carrying out a broad-based people's spontaneous armed anti-Japanese movement to fight for their own survival, etc. (1st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

If the Japanese army attacks Rehe, Tang Yulin will definitely respect public opinion and resist. Feng Yuxiang has a very passionate patriotic heart. Although he is currently recuperating in Mount Tai, he will definitely come out of the mountains to serve if the country is in trouble. Shi told reporters that Japan's aggression against our country is a complete plan. It aims to seize Rehe Province and will disrupt the interior to divert attention. Our country must cooperate sincerely to be able to overcome the crisis. If Rehe is in trouble, the security of Tianjin and Beiping is very worrying. (1st Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Sovereignty of the Xisha Islands Belongs to Our Country</h3>
<p>Based on Three Reasons</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The French government previously sent a note to our country to discuss the sovereignty of the Xisha Islands and cited specious reasons to claim the archipelago belonged to the Annam government. Our government believes there is no doubt the islands belong to us and has ordered relevant departments and the Guangdong and Guangxi provincial governments to conduct an on-the-ground investigation of the archipelago to gather information for a rebuttal. It is reported that the relevant departments and the two Guang provinces have already submitted reports. The reasons are as follows: (1) According to the Sino-French Vietnam Boundary Treaty, the Xisha Islands are located east of the maritime boundary line signed in the treaty and should belong to us. (2) According to the principle of "prior appropriation" in international law, the archipelago should belong to us. Islands in international waters belong primarily to those who first occupy and continue to inhabit them, and this land belongs to the country of those inhabitants. The current residents of the archipelago are entirely Chinese, so it naturally belongs to us. (3) According to the principle of prescription, the archipelago should also belong to us. Our people have occupied the archipelago for a very long time. Many people from Guangdong have repeatedly petitioned the Guangdong provincial government to operate guano and fishing industries on the islands, and the French government has never raised any objections. We will refute the French claims based on these sufficient reasons. (1st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Expenditure During National Crisis</h3>
<p>He Yingqin Reports During Memorial Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin reported on the morning of the 1st, during the military headquarters memorial week, on the income and expenditure of national military expenses during the national crisis. He stated that, given the current financial difficulties, two principles must be adhered to regarding military expenditure: (1) Newly established military agencies should have their budgets reviewed by the competent departments of the military headquarters even after the unit is approved by the Military Affairs Commission. Only after the budget is approved can the organization be established. (2) While establishing new military construction is important, it is also necessary to consolidate and merge existing redundant agencies, transferring their funds to support new initiatives. Commander-in-Chief Jiang has approved these two principles, and the Military Affairs Commission has issued orders to all units to comply. He also said that the department plans to suggest to the Military Affairs Commission that, in the future, the regulations, organization, and funding of newly established military agencies should not be drafted by the agencies themselves, allowing for arbitrary expansion. Instead, they should be drafted and promulgated by the superior competent authorities. In this way, the national military budget will be fixed, and a balance between income and expenditure can gradually be achieved, enabling us to overcome the difficulties.

<h3>Results of German Parliamentary Elections Announced</h3>
<p>The National Socialist Party Fails to Obtain an Absolute Majority; The Center Party Holds the Power to Influence the Political Situation; The Papen Cabinet is Expected to Continue Holding Power</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 1st dispatch: It is now known that the number of votes cast in yesterday's election accounted for approximately 84% of the total. According to preliminary reports, the total number of votes was 36,845,279. The number of votes obtained by the major parties was: National Socialist Party 13,732,779, Social Democratic Party 7,951,245, Communist Party 5,278,094, Center Party 4,586,501. The new parliament will have 602 seats. According to the latest official report, the National Socialist Party has 229 seats, the Social Democratic Party 133, the Communist Party 89, the Center Party 76, the German National People's Party 37, the Bavarian People's Party 20, the German Democratic Party 7, the Economic Party, the Christian Social Party, and the Farmers' Party 2 each, and the Radical Middle Class Party 1. The election results have reached a stalemate, as expected. Therefore, the Papen government will remain in office. Maintaining the status quo of the political situation is a major blow to the National Socialist Party. Although the party gained 119 seats, even with the assistance of the far-right, it cannot hold an absolute majority in the parliament. The Catholic Center Party, led by former Chancellor Brüning, now has the power to influence the political situation. The most notable aspect of this election is the gradual recovery of the Communist Party after its setbacks in 1930, and the peak of the National Socialist Party's power. Although Chancellor Papen forcefully suppressed the Communist Party, it does not seem to have been harmed. In fact, it has gained 11 seats. It is said that the victory of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party is due to the workers' dissatisfaction with Papen's severe measures in the state of Prussia and their concern about Papen's ambition to establish a dictatorship. The German National People's Party also won many victories in various constituencies, but it did not obtain as many votes as it had hoped. The smaller parties have all suffered disastrous defeats and seem to have practically ceased to exist. According to German election law, each party can elect one member of parliament for every 60,000 votes it receives. Therefore, there is no problem with the election of leading figures. However, Hitler is not running for parliament, preferring to direct the activities of the National Socialist Party from outside the parliament. According to the number of votes in the Greater Berlin electoral district in this election, compared with the previous election, the Communist Party gained 55,000 votes, the National Socialist Party lost 37,000 votes, and the Social Democratic Party lost 98,000 votes.</p>
<p>The Nationalist News, Berlin, 1st dispatch: This morning, the German government officially announced the final results of yesterday's parliamentary re-election. The total number of seats in the new parliament is 602. The right-wing parties together have 276 seats, including 229 seats for the National Socialist Party, 37 seats for the National Power Party, 7 seats for the Nationalist Party, 2 seats for the Economic Party, and 1 seat for the Farmers' Party. In addition, the Christian Social Party, the Bavarian Farmers' Party, and the Huttenberg Farmers' Party each have 2 seats, totaling 6 seats. These three parties can be called quasi-rightists. In addition, the moderate former Chancellor Brüning group has 231 seats, including 133 seats for the Social Democratic Party, 75 seats for the Christian Center Party, 2 seats for the Bavarian People's Party, and 2 seats for the Democratic Party. The far-left Communist Party has 89 seats.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 1st dispatch: Now that the German House of Representatives election is over, one question is particularly noteworthy: what attitude will the Papen cabinet take towards the parliament? Although the German government's rule does not rely on the cooperation of the parliament, the current government would like to see a solid right-wing force in the new parliament to help it resist the left wing. However, the current cabinet does not hope that yesterday's election will produce a majority party on the right wing, because if it does, the cabinet will have to give way. It is likely that there will be no clear majority party in the new House of Representatives. This can be seen from the organizational situation of the new House of Representatives. Furthermore, Papen said in his address to the people last Saturday that the German people need a government that is independent of political parties. This is especially urgent today. The Center Party occupied a pivotal position in the old House of Representatives and will continue to do so in the new House of Representatives. It is likely that the government's majority force will be backed by the Center Party. In short, under the current circumstances, the government cannot express any opposition to the Center Party, and it cannot ignore the party. As for the Communist Party, its significant increase in votes yesterday is a major victory. From the perspective of the Center Party, this is a major problem. Will the expansion of the Communist Party's power cause the Center Party to join hands with the right wing in order to resist Bolshevism? Or will this lead to a strong conservative policy that promotes the extreme left wing of the workers? These are all problems caused by the Communist Party's victory yesterday.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 31st dispatch: The result of the German election is a stalemate. Hitler was confident that the National Socialist Party could win 45% of the seats in parliament. However, although the party has the most seats in parliament, it has not achieved its original hope. This election proves the victory of German common sense and discipline. According to various sources, election day was very peaceful. Many people regarded it as a holiday. Voters gathered in the morning and dispersed after voting, heading to the mountains or the coast for sightseeing. Special ballot boxes were set up in coastal areas to facilitate those who went to the seaside for vacation at the end of the week. The National Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party marched in the streets in many towns and cities in uniform, but there was no transgression. No party took any intimidating or coercive actions. In the event of occasional conflicts, the police intervened and stopped them without showing favoritism. The first to vote were President Hindenburg and Chancellor Papen. The German president personally went to Newtuck in East Prussia to vote, where the people came out to greet him. General Ludendorff did not vote and advised his party members not to vote either. There were disturbances during the election, but they were not important. People's hearts are easily agitated, so rumors are often inaccurate. It was rumored that Hitler's car was shot at, but after further investigation, it was learned that someone had only thrown potatoes at his car. The number of eligible voters in southern Germany who voted accounted for 85%. The percentage of votes cast in various places was very high. According to the news at 9 PM, the National Socialist Party won 36% of the seats. Compared with the old parliament, this is a victory, but it may not be possible to obtain 45% of the seats as it boasted. The total number of votes should be 44 million, but the actual number of voters was 35 million. At 11 PM, 30 million votes were checked. The results were: National Socialist Party 189 seats, Social Democratic Party 112 seats, Communist Party 72 seats, Center Party 65 seats, German National People's Party 31 seats, and remaining parties 36 seats. At that time, the number of seats won by the National Socialist Party was 70 more than before, while the Social Democratic Party lost 24 seats compared to before.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 1st dispatch: In response to the disturbances that occurred after the election, Prussian Acting Commissioner Bracht issued an order stating that this was a final warning, stating that if the political truce was not respected, the government would take extreme measures to deal with it. He also warned the Prussian newspapers that they would be severely punished if they contained inflammatory records.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 1st dispatch: The previous parliament had 557 members, and this parliament has increased to 607 members. The number of seats occupied by the main parties in the previous parliament was as follows: National Socialist Party 110, Social Democratic Party 136, Communist Party 78, and Center Party 69.</p>
<p>The Nationalist News, Munich, 1st dispatch: This afternoon, National Socialist Party leader Hitler issued a declaration to the Stormtroopers, congratulating them on the election results, calling it a major victory for the National Socialist Party, and encouraging the team members to work even harder in the future. It stated, "We have now achieved an unparalleled victory, all thanks to the majority of comrades who have spared no significant sacrifice. Our cause is a sacred duty to continue fighting for German freedom."</p>
<p>The Nationalist News, Berlin, 1st dispatch: This afternoon, the German Papen cabinet issued a formal declaration, encouraging all parties to work together on constructive legislation, indicating that the German cabinet can be expected to continue holding power indefinitely. The declaration stated that the results of this election prove that there cannot be a clear majority in parliament, and no single party can completely control the legislature. Therefore, parliament must return to its original work and engage in constructive legislation.</p>
<h3>Yu-chi's Political Activities</h3>
<p>Abandoned Due to Unripe Circumstances</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, August 1st - General Kazushige Ugaki, the Korean Governor-General, has been the focus of attention from various political circles since entering Kyoto. Some have proposed him as the next president of a certain party, while others have speculated about cooperation with Adachi. Ugaki also had ambitious aspirations, but due to the unripeness of the circumstances, the matter has been temporarily abandoned. He is now scheduled to return to Hanseong (Seoul) from Tokyo on the Fuji Express on August 4th.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 29th - News has it that General Ugaki's visit to Tokyo to consult with the government on Korean administrative matters has once again sparked rumors of Ugaki's entry into the political arena. Ugaki has served as Minister of the Army five times and has had close contact with National Assembly affairs. It is said that the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have repeatedly sought to recruit him. It is generally expected that if Ugaki does join a political party, he would inevitably choose the Minseito party, as Ugaki's previous appointments as Minister of the Army, with the exception of the Kiyoura Cabinet, were all under the mandate of the Minseito Cabinet. There are rumors that the Minseito party intends to elect Ugaki as its leader to replace Wakatsuki. This is not entirely without possibility, and if such a move were made, Ugaki might be willing to accept, and the position of Prime Minister in the future would be within Ugaki's reach.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to the United States Ordered to Return Home</h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, August 1st - Ambassador Debuchi to the United States has requested to return home to Foreign Minister Uchida. Therefore, Foreign Minister Uchida has now made the decision to reassign the Ambassador to the United States. Former Vice Foreign Minister Nagai Matsuzo is the most likely candidate for the position, or it is rumored that former Ambassador to Russia Tanaka Tokichi will be appointed.

<h3>Farmers' Representatives Clash with Police</h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, August 1st - At 8:30 this morning, 400 representatives of farmers and small citizens, centered around the Kanto Consumers' Cooperative Alliance, gathered at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to demand rice distribution. The situation became unstable, and a minor clash with the police force occurred. More than ten people were arrested, and the crowd dispersed at 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Teachers' Unpaid Salaries Lead to Reddening</h3>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, August 1st - The Japanese Ministry of Education has heard that many local elementary school teachers have joined the Communist Party due to unpaid salaries, and the number is increasing daily. To curb the reddening of the education sector, it is cooperating with the Ministry of Interior to order all elementary school principals nationwide to prepare reports. According to the reports received from 20 prefectures, out of 2,384 schools, 557 have unpaid salaries (23%). The famine areas in the Northeast have a large number of unpaid salaries. The Ministry of Education estimates that the number of schools with unpaid salaries is at least 3,000, amounting to 5.6 million yen. Although others do not have unpaid salaries on the surface, many actually collect various donations or sign IOUs, meaning that half of the elementary school teachers nationwide do not receive their salaries. Due to the hardship of life, they join the Communist Party. Recently, among the captured Communist Party members, teachers constitute the majority. The Japanese Ministry of Education intends to submit a detailed list of expenses to the Ministry of Finance for review and will propose at the next extraordinary session of the National Assembly that the government must provide 30 million yen to rescue elementary school teachers and prevent the education sector from entering a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Official Telegram</p>
<p>Lanzhou Telegram - To all comrades of the Beiping Islamic Student Association: We have received your telegram. Upon investigation of the handover documents, this case has been repeatedly reported by the Linthan Tibetan and Hui Muslim communities regarding mutual accusations of atrocities. Additionally, the Ministry of Interior has repeatedly sent notifications stating that the Tibetan and Hui Muslim communities of the county have requested investigations into various cases. The government has previously ordered Commander Lu Dachang and Commander Ma Lin to investigate and respond jointly. Subsequently, Commander Lu reported that the case initially involved local bandits in Linthan colluding with external bandits to massacre Tibetan civilians. Later, the Tibetan civilians retaliated by massacring Hui Muslims, all of which are factual circumstances. Furthermore, previous provincial government committees, along with Pacification Envoy Ma, held meetings on post-disaster affairs in the Linxia counties. It was resolved to control litigation and that all lawsuits from the date of the riots to the date of the change of guards would not be pursued, and the provincial government issued a public notice to that effect. Recently, the provincial government organized pacification efforts in Taozhou and Xining, and Commissioner Lin re-submitted the previous case, requesting that cases of mutual accusations of attacks due to the riots from the 17th year to the end of the fourth month of the 19th year not be pursued. Now that the local area is roughly peaceful and the people are gradually settling down, it is especially important to explain past grievances and promote mutual harmony. All past disputes should be relegated to the category of things that cannot be remedied in the past. If it is necessary to investigate each item, then the atrocities committed by unscrupulous elements within Islam since the 17th year would be countless. Even in Linthan, the massacre and looting of Tibetan civilians by Ma Ha-xi-shun and others, and the destruction of temples and houses into ashes, are difficult to investigate one by one. The provincial government has already strictly instructed Chieftain Yang to reconcile the Hui and Tibetan people and assist in pacification. The chieftain also knows to comply. It is hoped that your association will appreciate this intention, eliminate sectarianism, and prioritize pacifying the situation and reassuring the people, fostering the relationship between the Tibetan and Hui Muslims. It would be fortunate for the local area. This is our reply. Official seal of the Gansu Provincial Government.</p>

<h3>General Po-la-ssu on</h3>
<p>The Crisis in the Far East is Increasingly Urgent</p>
<p>Hoping that Japan Can Awaken Early, And Hoping that the League of Nations Investigation Team Will Be Serious</p>
<p>Osaka Asahi Shimbun, London - Recently, the changes in the Manchurian issue have become increasingly complex. British public opinion still maintains a calm attitude, but the submission of the report by the League of Nations Investigation Team, led by Sir Lytton, is approaching. All those with knowledge in both the government and the public believe that the situation is serious. General Po-la-ssu, who has been in China for many years, wrote to the "Times" on the 25th, stating that the current Japanese government's attempt to seize Manchuria has been clearly exposed. Therefore, the crisis in the Far East is becoming increasingly urgent. Diplomats from all countries are aware of the content of this situation. If Japan insists on recognizing Manchuria's independence, it will inevitably lead to unforeseen changes. Although Sir Lytton is working hard to ease Japan's difficult situation, we believe that to resolve this matter, the first thing to consider is whether those involved in this dispute can cooperate. If they cannot, the future is uncertain. Secondly, if the investigation team does not find any solution to the Manchurian issue dispute, the League of Nations will use what means to resolve it peacefully is also a major question facing us. Moreover, from Japan's perspective, the result is nothing more than withdrawing from the League of Nations. But what attitude will the Western European countries and the United States, which do not sympathize, take? If Japan, like the United States in the Americas, declares the Asia-Xi-men-Ya-Luo Doctrine, the situation may not be so simple. Therefore, the recent major crisis is becoming increasingly urgent. This is why everyone is pessimistic about the Manchurian issue. However, some Japanese citizens still cling to their delusions. British public opinion has not fully recognized the various difficulties encountered by the Japanese people. If they can clearly recognize them, there may be hope for a peaceful solution. The investigation team's report will be submitted soon. If Japan can repent early and does not want to be the initiator of the crisis, avoiding causing condemnation from various countries, then its sin will be small. Therefore, we hope that the investigation committee's report will be very cautious in order to achieve a peaceful solution.</p>

<h3>Accurate Number of Japanese Geng Funds Paid and Unpaid</h3>
<p>Payments Stopped Starting in July</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, in view of Japan's violation of current international agreements and its seizure of tax revenues from government-guaranteed debt reparations in the three northeastern provinces, decided to suspend payments of Japanese Geng Funds starting in July and issued a declaration on the 30th of last month. The issuance of the declaration has attracted considerable attention from Chinese and foreign authorities. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically inquired with the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai yesterday. According to its spokesperson, the Japanese authorities have not yet expressed anything about Minister Song's declaration on the 30th of last month because the Japanese authorities have not yet received official documents and should not express anything. If your country does suspend Geng Fund payments according to the declaration, the Japanese government will lodge a serious protest. Furthermore, according to the person in charge of the Shanghai Consular Corps, China's suspension of Japanese Geng Fund payments is a matter between China and Japan, and the Consular Corps does not want to express anything. However, from a personal point of view, if A seizes B's property, and that property is collateral for B's debt to A, then seizing the property and demanding the debt is unreasonable. It is heard that since Minister Song issued the declaration suspending Japanese Geng Fund payments, he has suspended the July payment of £32,824 7s 5d for the Japanese portion of the Geng Funds. The total amount of Geng Funds that the Chinese government should repay to Japan and the accurate amount that has been paid and unpaid are shown in the following table:</p>
<p>From 1912 to 1914, the annual payment should be £221,732.87; in 1915, the payment should be £259,439.84; from 1916 to 1931, the annual payment should be £272,816.50; from 1932 to 1940, the annual payment should be £393,897.02; from 1941 to 1945, the annual payment should be £272,826.50.</p>
<p>The total amount of Japanese Geng Funds to be paid is £10,198,858.13. The amount paid up to the end of June 1932 is £5,586,650.96. The amount unpaid from July 1932 onwards is £4,612,207.17. Of the countries to which China should pay Geng Funds, in addition to Russia, Germany, and Austria, which have been canceled, and the international aspect, which has been paid off, there are still eleven countries: France, England, Japan, the United States, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands.</p>
<h3>Song's Telegram to Jinan Bank of China Allocates Military Pay for Han's Troops</h3>
<p>Still Supplemented by the Central Government with Tens of Thousands of Yuan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the restoration of the original state of the tax organs of various countries in Shandong, all tax revenues are submitted to the Jinan branch of the Central Bank of China every month. The military pay of 600,000 yuan for the Third Route Army under Han Fuju is also issued by the Central Bank every month. In June, due to the slack tax revenue month, only 400,000 yuan was collected. Jiang Bocheng, representing Chiang Kai-shek, went to Jinan from Peiping and telegraphed Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, requesting the Central Government to allocate 200,000 yuan to make up the full 600,000 yuan, which was allocated in full for the military pay of the Third Route Army. Now it is time to issue military pay in July. Song Ziwen had already telegraphed Xu Jizhuang, the head of the Jinan Central Bank branch, that 600,000 yuan for the military pay of Han's troops had been fully allocated at once on the 25th. The tax revenues submitted by the tax organs of various countries are then submitted to the Central Government. It is estimated that the tax revenues currently received include 200,000 yuan from salt tax collected twice, 120,000 yuan from other consolidated taxes, 130,000 yuan from stamp, tobacco, and alcohol taxes, over 10,000 yuan from Shandong mining tax, over 20,000 yuan from Zhongxing mining tax, and 3,000 yuan from Weixian tobacco tax, totaling 470,000 to 80,000 yuan, which has been submitted to the Central Government. Although the tax revenue is 70,000 to 80,000 yuan more than that of June, the Central Government still needs to allocate tens of thousands of yuan to supplement it. It is expected that the tax revenue next month will be more prosperous than this month, and the salt tax can be collected more, or there may be no need for the Central Government to allocate funds for subsidies again. Xu Jizhuang, the head of the Jinan Central Bank branch, telegraphed Chiang Bocheng in Peiping after clearing the military pay, and has now received Chiang's reply, stating that he had originally intended to accompany Chairman Han on a trip to Jinan, but now that the military pay has been allocated, he will postpone his visit to Jinan for the time being.</p>
<h3>Work Relief Completes Guangdong-Hankou Railway</h3>
<p>Ministry of Railways Notifies Hunan Provincial Government to Investigate</p>
<p>In order to complete the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and implement work relief, the Ministry of Railways specifically notified the Hunan Provincial Government to investigate the number of disaster victims. The notification reads: [Regarding the matter of reply, it is approved that your government has consulted, according to the Hunan Disaster Relief Association Director Su Kanshi's request to complete the Guangdong-Hankou Railway on schedule and to start the Hunan section ahead of schedule, implementing work relief, and requesting immediate verification and reply, etc. Approved. Upon investigation, the completion of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway has long been actively prepared by the Ministry. Regarding the case of constructing the Hunan section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway ahead of schedule for work relief, Yuan Dexuan had previously submitted it to the Executive Yuan for submission to the Ministries of Railways and Interior and the Disaster Relief Committee for review, and the Disaster Relief Committee declared that the completion of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway was within the scope of the Ministry of Railways. The proposed completion ahead of schedule would benefit the victims and should be handled by the Association to investigate the number of disaster victims, wait for the Ministry of Railways to raise funds, conduct it earnestly, and then discuss the handling. After consultation between the Ministries of Interior and Railways, although the British Geng Funds have been allocated for the completion of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, to deposit a large amount to cover the entire Hunan section and start construction still requires time, and the surveying and preparation work procedures before the start of construction of that section have not been completed. It is proposed to wait until that section is actually under construction before discussing the work relief issue with the Disaster Relief Committee. It was then submitted to the Executive Yuan for Directive No. 5023 on January 4 of this year, which stated that the proposal to handle it as discussed should be approved, etc. Subsequently, Su Kanshi and others submitted a request to the Ministry to complete Guangdong-Hankou ahead of schedule for work relief, and the Executive Yuan issued a document to the Ministry, which was then transferred to the Zhushao section engineering bureau of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway for verification and rebuttal. In view of the previous reasons for consultation, the Ministry should respond to the Hunan Provincial Government regarding the circumstances of the Ministry's handling of this case. The Provincial Government is requested to investigate.</p>
<h3>Pacification Plan for Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Divided into Southern and Northern Fujian Areas, Cai Tingkai is Temporarily in Zhangzhou and Will Not Come to the Province, Lu and Ma are Still Fighting in Northern Fujian</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the establishment of the Fujian Pacification Headquarters, Acting Director Cai Tingkai decided to formulate an overall plan for pacification, bandit suppression, and construction for public announcement and implementation. Cai himself is currently in Zhangzhou, commanding Shen's division to advance towards Longyan to first eliminate the Red bandits in the Yan-Ning area. After the Yan bandits are eliminated, he will come to the province. Therefore, the pacification affairs of this province are temporarily divided into Southern and Northern Fujian areas. The Southern Fujian area will set up a pacification director's office in Zhangzhou, which will be established on August 1. All ongoing events will be decided by Cai himself. The Northern Fujian area will be under the command of the Pacification Headquarters, with Chief of Staff Deng Shizeng acting as the main director. The first step in bandit suppression in Southern Fujian is to first eliminate the Yan Red bandits, and the second step is to suppress the Yongding-Hangping Communist bandits, and then join forces with the Northern Fujian troops to suppress the bandits in the Tingzhou area. At the same time, work will also begin on transportation, industry, and militia training to seek local rehabilitation. The detailed plan has been convened by Cai, gathering military officers, county magistrates, and people from all walks of life to discuss and resolve it at a meeting on August 3. On the Northern Fujian side, Deng Shizeng and Division Commander Liu Heding are discussing in the province to first eliminate scattered bandits in the interior and consolidate border defenses. The first step is to wait until the Southern Fujian troops leave Longyan before joining forces to suppress the Red bandits in the Tingzhou area, and to designate the troops stationed in Northern Fujian to be responsible for the elimination of banditry and all aspects of local revitalization within their respective defense areas. The detailed plan has been retained by Deng Shizeng for Liu Heding to postpone his return to Yan, so that he can discuss it in the province and formulate regulations with reference to the Southern Fujian progress steps. In about half a month, the pacification plan for Southern and Northern Fujian can be specifically determined. The Pacification Headquarters issued a proclamation yesterday, hoping to work hard with the people. The original text is as follows: [For the matter of proclamation, it is known that this director is ordered to pacify Fujian, thinking that if the pacification is not achieved, he will only fear death and failure. When the troops arrive, observing customs comes first, and the people's suffering waiting to be relieved is particularly urgent. Fujian Province is known as Zou and Lu, originally a land of culture, but it is like the world changing, and it has become a land of sores and diseases. The red flames fill the sky, causing disturbances for years, and the yellow sand fills the land, with no day to sweep it away. This director has the mission of appeasement and the determination of defense. The current situation is a cause for concern. Our people sleep in tents and walk on thorns. They are deeply in the ravines and the weeds grow long. They travel by water and often encounter mosquitoes. Farmers are tired in the fields, and merchants are exhausted on the road. This is what this director knows and urgently seeks to work together to remove them. Now is the period of political tutelage, and the work of self-governance is important. How can we bear the suffering of the dispersed people and add to the injury of being bound by chains? This headquarters has just been established, and there are many initial creations. First, we plan to eliminate bandits and reds, and eliminate harassment. The general outline is roughly determined, and specific items will be implemented in succession. All responsibilities of this headquarters will be implemented in sequence. The people are in the midst of fire and water, and they should have the hope of sleeping on mats. We rely on everyone to express their great views and jointly establish the region. Following the spirit of Prime Minister Sun's construction and planning for the well-being and safety of our compatriots, we dare to say that we have this deep heart and will be cautious and diligent. We still hope to work together to support this good work, cut off the atmosphere of bandits, and ensure that there are no weapons in the villages and mulberry and hemp in the fields, leisurely enjoying the sky and having land where everyone can be happy. This is our deep hope. For this reason, we proclaim to the people to understand this intention, encourage each other, and act. This is essential. This proclamation.]</p>
<p>Lu Xingbang, the newly formed Second Division, and Ma Hongxing, the Sixth Brigade under his command who rebelled, are fighting in Guihua in Northern Fujian. It has already been reported in previous reports. Now it has been investigated that on July 1, Lu's division sent four battalions, commanded by the former Sixth Brigade Commander Lu Xinming (who was driven away by Ma Hongxing), to besiege Gui City. It has been more than two weeks since then, and the fighting has been going on day and night. Ma's troops have suffered repeated defeats and heavy casualties, with only about 500 people left. They have ordered the men and women in the city to defend the city day and night, while Lu's troops are bombarding the city with heavy artillery and smoke bombs, and eight or nine out of ten of the dead and wounded are civilians. Moreover, since the war began two months ago, the people's rice and grain have been confiscated. If it is prolonged without resolution, the tens of thousands of lives in the city will either become cannon fodder or starve to death. Yesterday, the Guihua Provincial Association submitted a special report to the Provincial Government and the Pacification Headquarters, stating that Guihua is the gateway to Shaxian, Yong'an, and Jiangle counties, and its importance to the safety of the upper and lower reaches is extremely important. Now that the Red bandits have taken advantage of the situation to invade Qingliu and Ninghua, if we continue to hesitate and wait and see, they will inevitably directly approach Guihua and Jianning, penetrating deep into the hinterland of Northern Fujian. The overall situation of suppressing the reds will fail. We urge you to telegraph Division Commander Liu Heding and Brigade Commander Zhou Zhiqun to send troops nearby and quickly resolve the situation. It is heard that the Provincial Government believes that after Ma's brigade broke away from Lu's division, it was reorganized into a Red Suppression Guerrilla Force under Liu's division, and the supplies were still allocated from Lu's division's military network, so Lu's troops expressed deep dissatisfaction with this. Therefore, although repeated telegrams to stop it have been ineffective, Division Commander Liu Heding has been summoned to the province by the Pacification Headquarters. Acting Chairman Li Kesheng is consulting with him. Division Commander Liu has requested to telegraph Lu's division to stop the attack and lift the siege, and then order Ma's troops to withdraw from Guihua and go to the division's defense area to await reorganization. It is unknown whether it can be done. (July 29)</p>
<h3>Shandong Yellow River Water Level is Stable</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In recent days, the Yellow River water has repeatedly risen, mainly due to heavy rain in Shanxi and Shaanxi, so the water flow is strong and flows straight down. Now that the rain has passed, it is gradually stabilizing. Although the water level at the upstream works has risen by one foot and nine inches for days, there are some movements in the levees and dams, but there is no major problem. However, Li Shengcun is a famous dangerous work. Because the main flow directly hits the fourth dam and then rushes the ninth and tenth dams, the brick protection of the fourth dam collapsed for twelve feet, and the protection of the ninth dam also collapsed in a section. The work situation is slightly tight. They are currently working day and night to reinforce it. Director of the River Affairs Bureau Zhang Lianjia returned to Jinan last night after inspecting the upper reaches. He may go to the lower reaches again in the next few days. Today, the water mark at Luokou rose by two inches and four tenths (equivalent to seven inches and two tenths of a market foot), and the water level is 29 meters and 8 inches and 8 tenths (equivalent to eight zhang, nine chi, six inches and four tenths of a market foot), which is only one meter and nine tenths less than the highest water level of 30 meters, 9 inches, and 4 tenths last year. The telegram from Zhang Lianjia to Chairman Han in Peiping reporting his return to Jinan, the telegram from the upper reaches reporting the work situation at Li Shengcun, and the entire river water level fluctuation table are recorded below. (1) Zhang Lianjia's telegram to Han: Chairman Han Jun of the Shandong Provincial Government, No. 3 Silk Thread Alley, Peiping. I, Lianjia, went to the upper reaches and arrived at the junction of Hebei and Shandong to inspect the Zhukou project. There are no major changes. However, the Li Shengcun levee and dam have some movements due to the rising water and rapid flow. I have supervised the workers and soldiers to reinforce it firmly. The other works, although the water has risen by one foot and nine inches for days, have now gradually subsided, and all the works are stable. I, Lianjia, returned to the bureau last night and respectfully reported this to you to relieve your concern. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau. (2) The telegram from the upper reaches reporting the project: Omitted. For days, the main flow at Li's project has been directly hitting the fourth dam and then rushing the ninth and tenth dams. The brick protection of the fourth dam has collapsed a total of twelve feet, and the water level has risen by about one foot. The protection of the ninth dam has also collapsed in a section. We are urgently using straw to reinforce the upper floors. The fourth dam and the tenth dam are reinforced day and night. Yu Chechaliao's boat went down to Kangtun for three miles. Two bundles of lead wire were transported by cart to urgently protect the front of the six and seven dams. I have used lead wire to reinforce the barriers to prevent the rising water from washing them away. In addition to leading the soldiers to continue to repair each dam, I respectfully report this. Zhang Lufu and Sun Huaizhou.</p>

<h3>Thorough Investigation of Corruption in Anhui Northern Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>Bengbu Circles Organize Support Association</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The case of Quan Shaowu, Anhui Northern Relief Commissioner, and Chang Shucheng, owner of Baoxing Flour Mill and director of relief wheat transportation, engaging in private gain and corrupt practices, delaying relief efforts, has recently been investigated by a delegation organized by Sun Yunxin and Wang Chusheng, representatives of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee, Lu Yinan and Yue Xiangru, representatives of the Anhui Shanghai Fellow-Townsmen Association, and Shi Dechun and Wang Zhaoquan, representatives of the Anhui Beijing Fellow-Townsmen Association, and other six people. They have been conducting thorough investigations into the truth of the corrupt practices and auditing relief books and receipts and collecting evidence of private gain. Representatives from local circles here have also organized a Bengbu Thorough Investigation Support Association, and Peng Zhuoru and eight others have been elected as members. The association has now been established and today (30th) issued official letters notifying the relief branches in the twenty-one counties of northern Anhui. The original letter stated, "Dear Sirs, Unfortunately, northern Anhui suffered a flood disaster, the Huai River flooded, fields and houses were submerged, and refugees were everywhere. Fortunately, our National Government and Anhui fellow-townsmen, taking on the spirit of 'drowning as if they themselves were drowning' and 'hunger as if they themselves were hungry', widely bestowed relief to save millions of affected fellow countrymen. There is much to admire in disaster relief and helping the distressed. However, due to the wide scope and difficult supervision, and the complexity of distribution, there were inevitably errors. Therefore, the central government sent several investigation teams to investigate the relief in northern Anhui, but they were ultimately unable to conduct a thorough investigation. Now, another thorough investigation team has come to Bengbu, and our association, in order to assist the investigation team in thoroughly investigating the malpractices in relief efforts, and to contribute our opinions to the investigation team, has organized the Bengbu Thorough Investigation Support Association. However, we are short-sighted and unskilled, and our knowledge is limited. Therefore, we request that your association, within three days of receiving this letter, inform us in detail of the quantity of relief wheat, funds, and flour that should have been received, the amount received, the amount distributed, and the amount remaining for official relief, charity relief, industrial relief, and emergency relief, so that we can compile a complete statistic, so that the relief efforts in northern Anhui can be clarified one day. We are notifying your association accordingly, and we hope to receive a reply. We would be most grateful." (July 30th)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Inspection Group</h3>

<p>Wang's Speech: The reporter visited Mr. Wang Xiaolai this morning to inquire about the situation of the anti-war movement. Mr. Wang made the following remarks: "We feel that since the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, the Japanese have committed atrocities in the Northeast and Shanghai, and the people have suffered untold misery. In order to save the people from suffering, we must unite against foreign aggression and should not have any more civil wars. Now the national economy is in dire straits, and the raw materials used by industry and commerce are completely dependent on foreigners. Industry and commerce are like newborn babies. The raw materials from abroad are like a knife. If the baby is repeatedly cut by the knife, how can we expect it to grow? Therefore, if we want to develop industry and commerce, we must first seek the ability to produce raw materials ourselves, so as to avoid the baby being cut by the knife. Our country has been in civil war for many years, which has had a major impact on the local and national economy. Economic panic and construction are out of the question. Civil war and construction are closely related. If we want to build, we must first abolish civil war before we can hope to succeed. We have launched a movement to abolish civil war, and some people outside are quite skeptical. But what is called civil war is very easy to distinguish. Fighting for power and seizing territory are all civil wars. As for the Red bandits who kill and set fires, we should find ways to eliminate them, which cannot be counted as civil war. We sent people to Guangdong to persuade them about the recent incidents, and the results were good. In short, we will never cooperate with any civil war that is detrimental to the local area or the country. Only, one more person in this movement has the strength of one person, and we urgently hope that local people's groups will participate in joint cooperation to facilitate progress. Therefore, we take this opportunity to contact various places. Now this conference is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on August 27, when we can discuss the measures together," etc. (July 29)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Circles Oppose Production and Sales Tax</h3>
<p>Tax Collection Increases Prices, Affecting the Livelihood of Ordinary People</p>
<p>Businessmen and Merchants Resolutely Request Cancellation</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Jiangxi Provincial Government, due to the lack of funds for bandit suppression and post-disaster reconstruction, has added a production and sales tax on imports and exports, as reported in previous news. In addition to imported foreign goods, the goods subject to the tax include bamboo and wood, paper, ramie cloth, porcelain, medicinal materials, and soybeans produced in the province. Bureaus have been established in Jiujiang, Hukou, Nanchang, Zhangshu, Jingdezhen, and other places to collect the tax. The tax rate is based on the consumption tax of the former Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance, divided into daily necessities, semi-luxury goods, and luxury goods, ranging from 2.5% to 10%. When the tax was first implemented, merchants and people in various places strongly opposed it. Industries in Nanchang and Zhangshu petitioned the provincial government, stating that the province had suffered from banditry and chaos, people's lives were difficult, and all industries were declining. The taxes collected on various goods would indirectly be borne by the people. In this time of saving the dying and healing the wounded, how could they further increase the burden on the people? However, Governor Xiong told the petitioners to endure the pain temporarily and to take responsibility for suppressing bandits and saving Jiangxi. The petitioners returned empty-handed. Later, the Nanchang and Zhangshu Chambers of Commerce prepared to launch a larger and more effective opposition. Governor Xiong stated that destroying the donation for bandit suppression and post-disaster reconstruction was tantamount to destroying bandit suppression, which was a lack of understanding of the greater good, and ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly investigate and punish merchants who opposed the tax donation. The opponents in this city then disappeared. It is said that merchants and people in several places are still very determined in their opposition. For example, when the people sent by the General Bureau of Production and Sales Tax arrived, the merchants and people of the whole port blocked them from landing and agreed not to sell food to the people of the tax bureau, not to rent houses to the tax collectors, and hotels and inns were not allowed to let them rest. The intensity of the situation can be seen. Yesterday, a gentleman in the business community said that the government estimated to collect 2.5 million to 3 million yuan from this tax annually. However, Jiangxi Province has been ravaged by bandits for five or six years, the bandit areas account for 70% to 80%, and due to natural and man-made disasters, the rural economy has completely collapsed. The purchasing power of foreign goods has been declining like a river flowing down, and it is difficult to expect imported taxes to improve. On the export side, the producing areas of bamboo and wood are in Chongyi and Shangyou in southern Jiangxi, and Chongren and Yihuang in eastern Jiangxi, all of which are in the hands of bandits. The main producing areas of paper are Qianshan, Guangfeng, Yihuang, and Wanzai. Most of the raw materials are bamboo, and 80% to 90% of the mountainous areas with bamboo are occupied by bandits. Due to the impact of the September 18th Incident last year, the sales of ramie cloth have greatly decreased, and the coarse cloth sold to Korea has disappeared. Yudu, Ningdu, Wan'an, and Guangxin produce the most oil, which used to be a major export. Recently, these counties have been completely bandit-ridden, and oil from other provinces is imported from Hukou. Jingdezhen porcelain is a world-famous industry and a major product of China. In recent years, it has been under pressure from foreign porcelain and is on the verge of extinction. It was captured by bandits twice in the past two years, and its essence has been lost. Most of the businesses have not yet recovered. The prospect of export tax is also not difficult to imagine. Moreover, after the implementation of this tax donation, the cost of export goods has increased, and sales have been greatly affected. The price of imported goods has increased, such as white sugar, which used to be 600 copper coins per catty, has now risen to 720, and foreign oil, which used to sell for 520, is now more than 600. The prices of other goods have increased by 10% or 20%. The livelihood of ordinary people is unbearable. Therefore, Jiangxi fellow villagers abroad are unanimously opposed to it. Celebrities such as Li Xiehe, Liu Zhi, Xu Sudong, Zhang Dingfan, Zhou Lisheng, and Sun Jingya have also successively petitioned the central government to order the provincial government to immediately cancel the tax in order to relieve the suffering of the people. It is said that Minister Song has sent a telegram to the province asking Governor Xiong to cancel the production and sales tax that is a disguised form of Likin. The telegram has been published in newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai. However, it is still unknown when the bureaus will cancel this tax. (July 27)</p>

<h3>Changshu Chamber of Commerce Meeting on Business Tax</h3>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Association Seizes a Large Quantity of Hate Goods</h3>
<p>The Wuyi Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has recently received secret reports from Shanghai stating that a large quantity of hate goods was being transported to the area. The association's director, Yang Yin, along with inspectors, immediately launched a thorough investigation. On the afternoon of the 31st, at around 5:00 PM, they discovered a cargo ship near Huimin Bridge. While inspecting the ship, Zhang Wenming, a clerk from the Qianqiufang Hengshun Foreign Goods Store, invited Yang and others to the store to talk, attempting to bribe them to release the cargo ship. Yang and others explained the importance of righteousness and immediately reported to the Anti-Japanese Association and the County Party Headquarters, transporting all the goods to the shore. Those without suspicion were immediately returned to their respective owners.

<h3>Business Tax Assessment Increased</h3>

Due to the impact of the Shanghai war, even the assessed amount could not be fully collected. This year, in the spring and summer seasons, the Finance Department sent personnel to collect the tax. The investigation procedures have not yet been completed. Recently, the Finance Department appointed Lu Fengtai as the director, and the assessment has been increased to between 180,000 and 270,000 yuan, scheduled to take effect from the autumn season.</p>

Yesterday (the 30th), at around 10:00 PM, Linpei was already asleep, while Gu was still outside the door cooling off. Suddenly, she heard her husband cry out in pain from inside the room. She rushed inside and saw that he had been stabbed in the lower abdomen, and the bed was covered in blood. He was barely alive, and the assailant had already fled without a trace. The reason for the assassination may be related to jealousy. Today (the 31st), the injured man's condition has not worsened, and his life is not in danger.</p>

<h3>Seventeen-Year-Old Maid Raped</h3>
<p>Su Zhen, the 17-year-old daughter of Shen Mo, a village woman from Wanjia Pavilion in Banshan, Hang County, was introduced by a neighbor to work as a maid at the Wang Fulian (also known as Yongzhao) clothing store near the Bodhi Jing She in West Lake due to poverty and difficulty in obtaining food and clothing. It was agreed that her monthly salary would be two yuan. The girl slept in a shed behind the house at night. Unexpectedly, Wang found the girl to be quite attractive and, being from the same village, became lustful. One night, he sneaked into the shed while she was asleep and raped her using violent means. The next day, he gave her a silk dress and a bracelet, enticing her to become his concubine. The girl realized she had been deceived and fled to the Cui and Li families. Wang came and created a commotion, and the police were called to escort him to the court. After investigation by prosecutor Zhou, it was determined that there was reasonable suspicion of rape, and Wang Yongzhao and Wang Zhang were ordered to be detained pending investigation. The girl Su Zhen was taken back by her mother to await further proceedings.</p>
<h3>German Secretly Exploits Mineral Resources in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>The provinces of Zhejiang are rich in mineral deposits. The Mineral Resources Survey Institute of the Construction Department sent personnel to various counties to investigate and discovered many new mining areas. However, due to a lack of capital for exploitation, they have attracted the attention of foreigners who are secretly exploiting them. It has come to the Construction Department's attention that, according to a telegram from the Liancheng Mineral Company, a German named Pu Dixi is secretly exploiting the Shipingzhou mine in Qingtian County. They have requested that the county be ordered to investigate and handle the matter according to the law. Yesterday, a telegram reported that the first batch of 20 tons of secretly mined ore sand has been transported from Ruoxi to the Wenzhou customs office, ready for shipment to Shanghai. Upon receiving the telegram, the Construction Department immediately telegraphed the county magistrate, ordering him to investigate and report the matter as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>List of Davis Cup Champions</h3>
<p>The Davis Cup world tennis tournament began in 1900 and has been held for 32 years. The European War interrupted the tournament for four years. A list of the past champions is as follows:</p>
<p>1900-1902 (3 times) United States</p>
<p>1903-1906 (4 times) Great Britain</p>
<p>1907-1911 (5 times) Australia</p>
<p>1912 (1 time) Great Britain</p>
<p>1913 (1 time) United States</p>
<p>1914 (1 time) Australia</p>
<p>1915-1918 European War - Tournament Suspended</p>
<p>1919 (1 time) Australia</p>
<p>1920-1926 (7 times) United States</p>
<p>1927-1932 (6 times) France</p>
<p>Total: 29 Competitions</p>
<p>United States: 11 times</p>
<p>Australia: 7 times</p>
<p>France: 6 times</p>
<p>Great Britain: 5 times</p>
<h3>French Domination Stuns the World</h3>
<p>Looking at the past 29 competitions, the United States and Great Britain initially shared dominance. Then Australia rose to prominence and held the lead for five years. After the European War, the situation changed. After winning once in Australia, the United States won the championship for seven consecutive years, proudly declaring itself the world leader. Then France rose to prominence, with its "Four Musketeers" achieving great success and defeating all opponents to seize the Davis Cup. For the past six years, they have consistently defended their title and are showing a tendency to gradually surpass the United States in the number of victories.</p>
<h3>Borotra's Hard Work and Great Contributions</h3>
<p>Speaking of this year's competition, France's retention of the championship is largely due to Borotra. In the two singles matches, he defeated his opponents entirely through his superior technique. In the third-day singles match, he particularly demonstrated his ability to survive in a desperate situation. A single mistake could have led to a huge error. The key to his success was his maturity, stability, and skillful use of his strengths. One person's efforts have brought honor to an entire nation. Borotra's hard work and contributions are truly commendable.</p>
<h3>The United States' Failure Is Blamed on Vines</h3>
<p>The world regarded Vines, the young American player considered the second Tilden, as disappointing in this final. Before the competition, people generally believed that the United States had a better chance of winning. The United States' doubles team was almost certain to win. The key to victory lay in the four singles matches. With Vines on the team, the United States could have been carefree. However, the young general's skills were good, but his experience was lacking. In the first match, he made mistakes due to nervousness and was defeated by Borotra. Although the entire team later put in extra effort, it was difficult to reverse the situation. They watched as the French players seized the Davis Cup.</p>

It is expected that the final race, in addition to the aforementioned three, will also feature intense competition from Simpson (USA) and Yoshioka (Japan). In the 10,000m final, the Finnish athletes were surprisingly defeated by the Polish athlete Kusociński. Kusociński's time of 30 minutes 11.4 seconds was a new Games record, breaking the previous record of 30 minutes 18.8 seconds held by Nurmi of Finland, but it still did not surpass Nurmi's world record of 30 minutes 6.2 seconds. In the women's javelin final, Ms. Didrikson of the United States set a new world record with a throw of 43.68 meters, breaking the previous world record of 42.32 meters held by Ms. Schluma of Germany. Sexton's shot put of 52 feet 6 inches (16.01 meters) was also a new Games record. American track and field athlete Sexton won the shot put championship.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Quotations from the 93-Year-Old Ma Xiangbo</p>
<h3>Where is Vladivostok?</h3>
<p>— Written by Han</p>
<p>Chinese people's lives are worthless, their reputation is worthless, and their territory is even more worthless. In the last hundred years, I don't know how much of our beautiful land has been lost in confusion! I read foreign books as early as the sixth year of Xianfeng, so I knew something about geography. At that time, I already knew that the area north of the Heilongjiang River was ours, and Sakhalin Island was also ours. I also knew that Sakhalin Island had a special product called seahorse, and the skin of the seahorse was very valuable. At that time, Sakhalin Island paid tribute to China every year, and seahorse was a special feature of the tribute. The customs of Sakhalin Island were also very different from those of China. For example, in Sakhalin Island, deer were used as cattle for farming and pulling carts, which was not seen in mainland China.</p>
<p>Now that the situation in Rehe is urgent, I am reminded of Rehe. Rehe was a summer resort for the emperors of the Qing Dynasty. Rehe had a hunting ground as large as a prefecture, specially for the emperor to gallop and hunt. In the tenth year of Xianfeng, the Anglo-French Allied Forces captured Beijing. In August of that year, Emperor Xianfeng fled to Rehe, and Prince Gong temporarily took charge. At that time, many eunuchs and palace maids followed, and even the grass paper used by the palace maids had to be paid for by the national treasury. This is a very ugly historical fact!</p>
<p>When Vladivostok was taken by the Russians, the imperial court didn't even know where Vladivostok was. The Prime Minister's Office telegraphed the governors of various provinces, but no one could respond. At that time, I happened to be the director of the Shandong Qikou Machinery Bureau. The governor of Shandong asked me, and I pointed out the location of Vladivostok to them. At that time, it was impossible to find a map. Later, it was finally found in a church in the Shandong countryside. Think about it, such a big China didn't even have a map, the boundaries were not clear, and the latitude and longitude lines were not recognized. With such confusion, the territory would inevitably be lost sooner or later.</p>
<p>Speaking of borders and maps, there are two very valuable historical materials.</p>
<h3>Zheng Hongnian on the Difficulty of Finding a Job</h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>The number of unemployed people in China today is the highest record in the history of unemployment statistics in the world. As far as the knowledge class is concerned, not only those with meager skills cannot find a place to eat, but even students, even those who have returned from studying in the East and West, are often unemployed. As the school year comes to an end, millions of graduates leave school, and the society has millions more unemployed people. The graduates of National Jinan University are very numerous this year. The students believe that their president, Zheng Hongnian, has a reputation and knows many dignitaries. They asked him to find them jobs. Zheng said to them with emotion: "The officialdom of today is not suitable to enter, nor can it be entered. Those who become officials all come to eat. Since they become officials to eat, they naturally regard public affairs as light and how to enrich their personal lives as important. And it's not just for the life of one person. Their relatives and friends who cannot live are also attached to them and help them solve the problem of eating. The rice in the officialdom has been eaten by them, so why should we want to share a cup of soup with them? My youngest son has just returned from the New World. What he studied was diplomacy. He planned to obtain a superior position in the diplomatic world to display his talents. He asked me to find a way. So I wrote to Foreign Minister Luo. I was fortunate enough to receive a reply, but only a vacant position as a consultant to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. With my knowledge and my son's qualifications as a student abroad, that's all I got. What can you university students expect? But please don't be discouraged. I will do my best to help you." This is what the graduates of Jinan University told me. It is very difficult to find a job.</p>
<h3>The Terror of Tiger Might</h3>
<p>— Gu Dai</p>
<p>The heat this summer reached its highest degree, setting a new record at the observatory, and the duration of the heat was unprecedented in the past eight years, resulting in a severe epidemic in the Songhu area, which was rare in recent years. The situation is so miserable that it cannot be overstated. I dare to write down what I have seen and heard and publish it in this talk. I deeply hope that those who read my article will persuade their relatives, friends, and neighbors to get vaccinated as soon as possible for prevention. Its merit should far outweigh the support of charitable undertakings.</p>
<p>One of my relatives lives near the Guandi Temple in Ximen. The wife, a certain female, has never liked Western medicine. After the Shanghai war this year, the epidemic was bound to be severe. The newspaper has repeatedly reported it. Her husband persuaded her to go to the health bureau to get vaccinated. The woman said, "I have never been vaccinated in my life. I am already twenty-five years old. Why bother?" A week later, she went to her relative's house for a party. When she returned, she vomited and diarrhea. Her husband was afraid and planned to send her to the hospital, but the woman refused. He planned to hire a doctor for treatment, but the woman refused again. After a delay of half a day, the illness worsened. Her mind gradually failed. Her husband saw that the situation was not good and urgently hired a doctor for treatment, but the doctor could do nothing.</p>
<p>There is a woman surnamed Mou on Xilin Road in Ximen. She is usually strong and manages the housework in an orderly manner. One day, at lunch, she suddenly thought of eating soy sauce pork. She bought it and ate it with her husband. After the meal, she was very thirsty and bought a bottle of soda water and drank it. By evening, she felt slightly unwell. In an instant, her complexion changed drastically, as white as ashes. Her teeth were clenched tightly. Her husband was panicked when he saw this and tried to pry open her teeth with his fingers to feed her with ten drops of water, but her teeth would not move. In a hurry, he used a copper spoon from the table to pry it open. Unexpectedly, the spoon was bitten off by the woman and swallowed into her stomach. In less than a quarter of an hour, she suddenly died. More than three hours later, her chest and abdomen were still warm. She left behind a daughter, who was only three months old. It was extremely tragic.</p>
<p>In a certain village in Jiangwan Township, there was an old man named Hu Er who lived in a hut with his old wife, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren. After the war, life was already extremely difficult. Unexpectedly, Hu Er's son suddenly died of tiger plague. He was hastily buried. The next morning, Hu Er's second grandson also died of the epidemic. By evening, Hu Er also vomited and diarrhea. He died at dawn. At midnight, Hu Er's eldest grandson also died. Of the six people in the family, four died within three days. Only two generations of widows were left. Although these two generations of widows did not die in the Japanese army's artillery fire and were lucky enough to escape from the tiger's mouth, their future is difficult, and their food and clothing cannot be sustained. It is also very pitiful. This is what I heard on a trip to Jiangwan yesterday. The narrator is a neighbor of Hu Er, so what he said should not be false.</p>
<h3>Different Past and Present</h3>
<p>— Jin Junren</p>
<p>A friend told me that there is a saying in the essays of Life Weekly, "wind, horse, and ox principle." He asked me to guess its meaning. I said, "It's nothing more than 'as incompatible as wind, horses, and oxen'." The friend said, "No, no. In the past, people said that wind, horses, and oxen were incompatible. Now, wind, horses, and oxen cannot be separated for a moment." The friend knew that I had not read the newspaper, so he told me the general idea below.</p>
<p>"Wind" means to show off. "Horse" means to flatter. "Ox" means to boast. It means that today's people can do nothing but show off, flatter, and boast. Conversely, if one is good at showing off, flattering, and boasting, then the skills of getting along in the world are all encompassed, and there is no need to seek more abilities.</p>
<p>After listening to my friend, I couldn't help but laugh and admire the author's ingenuity in picking up the wisdom of the ancients and making his own wonderful article. Waste utilization could not be more profitable than this.</p>
<p>Think about it, today's people go out in cars and horses, live in foreign buildings, and have concubines flattering them and servants serving them. As for clothing, they wear summer clothes in summer and fur clothes in winter. As for food, they eat all kinds of delicacies. The pleasure of the body is truly beyond imagination. Those who see it praise it and envy it endlessly. It can be said that they are showing off to the fullest. But when you investigate the origin of their showing off, what is not the result of flattering and boasting? The past and present are different. There are many differences. I never thought that the immortal text would also change with the times. Isn't it strange?</p>
<p>Medical News: Medical Doctor Liu Junshi Hong graduated from Nanyang Medical University. He then went to various famous hospitals in Germany and Japan for many years of internship. He has a good understanding of internal medicine, especially diseases of the lungs, intestines, stomach, and nerves. After returning to China, he served as the director of internal medicine in major hospitals in China. Whenever there are difficult and complicated diseases, they are cured immediately after Dr. Liu's diagnosis and treatment. For example, my wife had suffered from lung disease for a long time and had been examined by Chinese and Western doctors, but it recurred from time to time because the root cause was not removed. Since last year, after Dr. Liu's acupuncture and medicine, the disease was cured and the root was removed in less than a month, and it has not recurred since then. My eldest and second daughters suffered from weak bodies and brain damage due to excessive study, and their nerves were stimulated, so they were plagued by illness for a long time and were treated repeatedly without recovery. Now they have also been cured by Dr. Liu's diagnosis. From this, I believe that Dr. Liu's academic knowledge and experience are indeed very rich and far from being comparable to those who only pursue false reputations. (Dr. Liu's Clinic) is now located at No. 21 Pobo Lane, Luban Road, French Concession (Xu Langxi)</p>
<h3>Imagist Paintings on the Yangtze River (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>(5) Unreasonable Stop</p>
<p>Abroad, it is already shameful for us to be discriminated against and bullied by foreigners, but thinking a step back, that is after all a foreign country, and we can still be less angry. But to be discriminated against by foreigners in our own country is unbearable.</p>
<p>When our ship arrived in Jiujiang, a piece of news spread like a storm throughout the entire cabin, adding a layer of anxiety to the hearts of many passengers who were in charge of duties. And this news finally became a concrete fact: it was decided that the ship would stop in Jiujiang for one night. The reason for stopping the ship was ridiculous. It was said that four Westerners on board were going to Guling to escape the summer heat. To get to Guling, they would of course have to disembark in Jiujiang. But even when they arrived in Jiujiang, they still refused to go ashore. Why? They said it was late and they didn't want to stay in Chinese-run hotels, so they had to stay on the ship for another night, and the precious time of more than five hundred Chinese passengers was sacrificed for the sake of those four people.</p>
<p>The next morning, it was already eight o'clock, but the ship still showed no sign of moving. What was the reason for this again? It was said that the four people going to Guling were having breakfast. After a while, it still didn't move, because one of the four was in the WC.</p>
<p>The entire ship of passengers was furious.</p>
<p>"Foreign devils are sent to Jiangxi."</p>
<p>"We Chinese are really hopeless."</p>
<p>Such angry curses could be heard everywhere, but they were too weak and useless in practice! But what reason do I have to say that they are weak? Forget it, if you don't improve yourself, then there is nothing unbearable about being bullied by foreigners.</p>
<p>(6) Fragmentary Notes</p>
<p>There are no Chinese passengers on the Nissin Shipping Company's ships. This shows China's anger towards the Japanese, but we must use the same spirit to deal with the ships of any country. Otherwise, the money will still flow to other countries if it doesn't flow to Japan!</p>
<p>Among the mountains on both sides of the Yangtze River, Mount Lu is the highest.</p>
<p>Huangshi Port is in eastern Hubei, and the scenery is excellent. The area produces iron, which is mined by the Japanese. China does not take its own wealth, which is the biggest reason for China's poverty.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River is China's main artery, but what can we see on this artery? Apart from the vast river water and the towering mountains, there are only warships flying foreign flags. If China is a sleeping lion, then will it really "sleep soundly for five thousand years"? (Quote from Wang Jingwei's poem "Ancient Cypress in Jinci")</p>
<h3>Striking the Bell in the Ancient Temple (62)</h3>
<p>— Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai Fu</p>
<p>Sixty-Nine</p>
<p>This ancient temple labor-study group occupies all my thoughts. When I was taking a walk in the courtyard after dinner, the ancient temple labor-study group floated up from my mind again. In a flash, many questions came one after another asking me to answer them. [What's the point of rigidly treating a factory as a factory? What's the point of rigidly treating a school as a school? What's the point of rigidly treating a society as a society?] Everyone is probably afraid that I will be arbitrary, right? My answer is... [There's no point in rigidly running a factory, rigidly running a school, or rigidly doing social work! Because doing it this way is tearing apart life and disintegrating living cells. Therefore, everyone who runs it is overwhelmed and cannot find a way out. What is the meaning of the life of an executioner! If you run a factory, if you also pay attention to the opportunities for the workers to grow and the relationship of equality and mutual assistance, it will immediately become a meaningful factory. If you run a school, if you also pay attention to the opportunities for teachers and students to produce and the relationship of equality and mutual assistance, it will immediately become a meaningful school. If you are transforming a society, if you also pay attention to the opportunities for production and growth of each member, it will immediately become a meaningful society.] I finally seemed to be even more enlightened. The change of name is only a formality. If running a business contains these three meanings, then it can be called a school, a factory, or a society. If these three meanings are not integrated, even if it is labeled as a labor-study group, it is no different from hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat. When I thought of being excited, I told Mr. Zhu everything. He said... [Your reasoning is indeed correct. The meaning of the labor-study group is not the name of the labor-study group, which will turn all longer-lasting life groups into meaningful groups. In ancient times, the family was almost a small labor-study group. Several famous Chinese armies are large-scale labor-study groups. Any group that is more permanent, if it does not contain the meaning of the labor-study group, will become a boring life and lead to aging. No group can be run rigidly. For example, prisons, if they are run rigidly, are worse than hell. Think about it, if all the prisons in the country were turned into labor-study groups, what a meaningful thing that would be! Think again, if all the families, shops, factories, schools, armies, and villages in the country were turned into labor-study groups! Everyone produces, everyone grows, everyone is equal and helps each other, everyone defends themselves and defends others! Then what a solemn country the Republic of China would become! The new life of the Chinese nation is latent in the seeds of the labor-study group. Gardeners, spread them widely!]</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Weekly Review</h3>
<p>(Report from American Eastern Banking Corporation)</p>
<p>Since the middle of this month, the New York stock market has shown signs of recovery, and this week it has been improving vigorously. However, the reason for this is difficult to speculate. In short, it is nothing more than a change in investor sentiment. In the past few days, people from all over the United States have been investing in and buying stocks continuously, and the New York market has suddenly become prosperous. Low-priced stocks are especially in demand in the market. According to people in the know, if the recent buying trend can continue for some time, investor confidence will become more solid, and the stock market will not see a reversal again. It is estimated that in one week, industrial stocks rose by 6.05, railway stocks rose by 4.17, and public utility stocks rose by 3.80. The rise in government bonds was even more rapid than that of stocks. Judging from the current sentiment, it is believed that in the near future, the stock market will continue to rise without falling. The Dow Jones Index is attached as follows:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Extremely Dull</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is sluggish and the situation is extremely dull because the actual demand in the market is stagnant and there is no activity from any party, resulting in dispersed morale. However, the attitude of buyers is still strong and they have no intention of relaxing because the inventory of various factories is drying up, so they still purchase when prices fall. However, sellers, due to the deteriorating environment and the lack of demand for spot yarn in various ports, coupled with the Japanese military's aggressive policy of invading Rehe, are inclined to sell. However, the situation of foreign cotton yarn has been relatively stable recently.</p>
<h3>Very Few Buyers in the People's Standard Market</h3>
<p>The opening of the previous market of the People's Standard was weak due to the report that it could not raise yarn prices. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and each month fell by 6.7 mace. The second and third sessions rebounded by 3.4 mace, and the closing session fell again. As a result, each month fell by 3.4.5 mace. The statistics show that 44,500 bales were traded. It was found that Jifeng sold 600 bales, Gengfeng 1,850 bales, Shenji 650 bales, Xincheng 850 bales, Deji 500 bales, and Mingde 500 bales. Yichang bought 950 bales, Laoxing 750 bales, Yukang 550 bales, Yongchang 800 bales, Taixing 700 bales, and Ruida 400 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>August 1495 Down 3 42,550</p>
<p>December 1475 Down 5 126,300</p>
<p>September 1489 Down 4 77,250</p>
<p>January 1473</p>
<p>October 1491 Down 6 115,550</p>
<p>Total 494,900</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn Consumption is Not Smooth</h3>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are very weak, and all ports are stagnant. It is found that only 150 bales were purchased by various gangs throughout the day. The market price fell by 5 mace to 1 tael. The amount purchased by various parties is listed below:</p>
<p>Inland 70 Datong 5 Luzhou 2</p>
<p>Guangdong 15 Ningbo 5 Zhenjiang 5</p>
<p>Shantou 25 Fellow traders 25 Total 150</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Advances Slightly</h3>
<p>The cotton market is relatively firm. American cotton is fixed, and its trend is slowly rising. Therefore, although investor sentiment in this port is good, most are bearish. However, the inventory is too dry, and foreign cotton is firm and rising. Therefore, it is actually difficult to fall at present. The weather has been good recently, and the progress of new cotton production is going smoothly. Therefore, the short-selling sentiment is still stable, and the future situation is lacking in certainty.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Bulls Harden</h3>
<p>The opening of the previous market of Zheng Standard was bullish because American cotton rose again. There were not many sellers in the market, and each month rose by 1.2 mace. The second and third sessions fell slightly. As a result, each month rose by 0.5 to 1.5 mace. The statistics show that 96,500 piculs were traded. It was found that Yuchang sold 3,100 piculs, Dafeng 1,200 piculs, Gengfeng 1,500 piculs, Ruida 1,200 piculs, and Changyu 900 piculs. Yuanda bought 2,000 piculs, Yichang 1,100 piculs, Yuande 1,100 piculs, Delong 1,100 piculs, Rongxing 800 piculs, and Yiyu 800 piculs. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Closing Price Increase/Decrease Account Balance</p>

<p>August 3220 Up 1.0 3,800</p>
<p>January 3165</p>
<p>October 3180 Up 0.5 231,700</p>
<p>Total November 3165 Up 1.5 284,900</p>
<h3>No Sales of Spot Cotton</h3>
<p>Spot cotton business has turned sluggish due to the weakening yarn market, resulting in no transactions.</p>
<h3>Yarn Exchange Increases Two-Account Commission</h3>
<p>The Yarn Exchange Brokers Association received a letter from the Exchange's Board of Directors stating that a meeting of all brokers would be held at 3:00 PM in the Exchange's second market to discuss all proposals regarding the increase in the two-account commission for cotton yarn. (1) The original cotton commission for two accounts was 2.5 taels per 100 piculs, now increased by 1 tael to 3.5 taels. (2) The original cotton yarn commission for two accounts was 10 taels per 100 pieces, now increased by 2.5 taels to 12.5 taels. However, this issue was not unanimously passed and will be discussed at the next meeting. There is no change to other commissions.</p>
<h3>India-UK Cotton Industry Weekly News</h3>
<p>Bombay Cotton Harvest Poor, Trend Firm; Liverpool Spot Quiet, Futures Stable</p>
<p>The Bombay market was firm last week. There was no significant activity from Japanese and European shippers. The needs of Europe and the Far East are still small.

The market for Egyptian cotton was firm due to the strength of prices in Alexandria.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Affected by Strong Winds and Grain</h3>
<p>Ending Weak; Opening Higher</p>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, due to the sudden wind on the Huangpu River, arrivals were few. Sales in various gangs were very enthusiastic. The prices of Suchang white rice were stable at first, but later the North City also started to rise. At the opening in the morning, each was higher by 20 cents. The top and middle grades had limited ups and downs. Liping white glutinous rice was generally raised by 10 cents. Buyers' attitudes were upward because the end of the month was approaching and the arrivals were becoming increasingly scarce. Early and late rice and foreign Du Jian were all firm. New glutinous rice was similar to yesterday.</p>
<p>New Gate: Sources from various roads were not many, and sales were brisk. Buyers of Changxi North glutinous rice were particularly active. Top-grade and middle-grade each increased by 20 to 30 cents. The source of early and late rice was slightly scarce. The inland and re-export gangs were slightly active, and the price rose by nearly 10 cents. Foreign Du Jian goods were scarce, and the price did not rise or fall. Although glutinous rice was firm, it showed an upward trend. The river factories opened about 3,000 piculs of various goods.</p>
<h3>Ning Shao Gang Briskly Handles Old Broken Rice</h3>
<p>A Total of 15,000 Bags Opened in the Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market turned active again because the Ning Shao gang suddenly became strong and the Tianjin gang continued to try it out. In addition, there was a succession of purchases from the local mainland street. A total of about 15,000 bags were traded in the market, and the market sentiment was extremely optimistic. However, the prices were not much higher than the previous market because the cargo owners intended to sell quickly and did not want to raise prices. However, there was an undertone of briskness. If there is another large batch of sales today and tomorrow, the market price can be increased immediately. A total of 4,000 bags of Xiaojiao were opened, priced at 9.45 yuan to 9.08 yuan. 8,000 bags of old Xiaojiao were priced at 9.20 yuan to 9.03 yuan. 1,500 bags of red Xiaojiao were priced at 8.35 yuan.

<h3>Standard Flour Discovered Strong Rise</h3>
<p>Approaching the Two-Tael Mark Soon</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market in each month showed a crazy rise again. Initially, the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly lower by a few cents and 1.2 to 3 dimes. The opening price this month was still flat, but after the opening, the mainland gangs entered briskly. The general opinion was that the price of wheat in the producing area was expensive. The price of Wuxi was 6.2 yuan, and the price of Suzhou steamed buns was 7 yuan, which was more than 1 yuan higher than the lowest time. In addition, the momentum of the big bulls was surging, and all parties were paying attention. Therefore, the price was raised sharply in each session, which was very fierce. According to this kind of scene, it is hoped that it will not turn back until it rushes to the 2-tael mark in the near future. The Tianjin gang also finalized 50,000 warships and 40,000 old cars yesterday, which were sent directly to Tianjin at a price of 2.04 taels (it is heard that half of them have not been allocated). After observing the subsequent steps, it is difficult to return unless foreign wheat is in line. As a result, this month was higher than the previous month by 1.75 cents, September by 2.75 cents, October and November by 3 cents, December by 2.75 cents, and January initially opened at 2.01 taels and the closing price was also higher by 1.5 cents.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Near Firm and Distant Flat</h3>
<p>Wheat transactions are sparse. After the opening of the futures wheat market yesterday morning, the market in each month showed a near firm and distant flat trend. This month, due to the sentiment of customer gangs, it was exceptionally firm. Generally, the price of wheat in the mainland also followed suit, and the spot wheat price rose by about 1 yuan compared with the lowest time. Therefore, everyone was bullish, and buying was enthusiastic. The distant term was slightly down by 1.2 to 3 dimes due to the quoted price of foreign wheat. Although transactions were smooth, the market was temporarily flat. After all, it has risen sharply for several days and is also covered when turning back, so it is soft and weak. As a result, this month was higher than the previous month by 3 cents, September was unchanged, and October to December were each lower by 1 cent. The spot wheat market was very rare. Because the goods were middle-grade, the asking price was still flat. The opening price of Wangxianqiao wheat was 3.16 taels and the price of Anting wheat was 3.08 taels, totaling 410 bags.</p>
<h3>Wheat Delivery of Thirty-Eight Cars</h3>

<h3>Sugar Market Brisk with Coarse Sand and White Sugar Transactions</h3>
<p>Market prices slightly lower. Yesterday, the Shanghai Sugar Association market was active. The transaction price of No. 24 coarse sand and white sugar from Dutch sugar was 14.6 taels, excluding tax. The price for buyers to pay the tax on behalf of them was 14.4 taels. Transactions were quite prosperous, all released by hoarding households and absorbed by the industry. More than 2,000 bags were traded, and the trend was still firm. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 16.4 taels, HX mark was 15.3 taels, and H mark was 12.55 taels. There were not many ins and outs, and the market was firm. Renji Factory sold a few hundred bags of No. 1 ice from its own factory, and the price of 15.6 taels was quite popular.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods, New Pickled Mustard Greens Arrived, Sales are Booming</h3>
<p>The market is still firm. Sichuan pickled mustard greens are still abundant this year. Now, before and after the new goods are launched, more than 10,000 jars have arrived.

The industry price is about 24.5 yuan to 22 yuan, and the market is average.</p>
<h3>New Heng Lotus Seed Price Becomes Looser</h3>
<p>The Yong and Guangdong Gangs Have the Strongest Appetite for New Heng Lotus Seeds</p>

Xiehe Foreign Firm, which sells a large amount of tea, has purchased no less than four or five thousand boxes of Zhenmei in the past two days. Other Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, and Tianyu major British firms have also joined in to replenish their inventory, and the market is unusually lively. The sales of Zhenmei, Xiumei, and Zhucha are also quite active. However, the Gongxi is still stagnant because the Russian merchants are watching.</p>
<h3>Yushan Tea Firm Has Not Yet Closed</h3>
<p>In previous years, the low-grade tea from Yushan and other roads in Jiangxi Province was sold very sluggishly by foreign merchants. This year, various firms have turned their attention to low-grade and cheap green tea because the high-grade goods from Wutun in Anhui Province are too expensive and unprofitable to transport and sell. Recently, sales have been particularly smooth. Therefore, Yushan Tea Firm plans to add new tea and Zizhuang after selling the first two batches. The production of tea trees in Qianyushan and Yushan differs from that of Anhui. The tea leaves develop in spring, summer, and autumn. In short, as long as the firm needs it, the mountain households can collect and supply it endlessly. At the moment, tea firms with more abundant capital and more stable sales are still waiting to close the market and still have the potential to add tea and continue to make it.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Stored Tea Has Been Sold Out</h3>
<p>The new tea from various villages in Beiyuan here was delayed due to late harvesting and production, and the market in Shanghai tended to fall. The tea firms here all suppressed prices and bought stingily. The mountain households initially did not expect the market to be sluggish for a long time, and most were unwilling to sell cheaply, so they stored more than 2,000 dan, and no one inquired about it. Until the Shanghai market turned around at the beginning of this month, the mountain households were forced to sell early due to the poverty of the economy. The firms also reduced the cost because the mountain price was reduced, and they were happy to purchase more. In the past two weeks, the inventory in Beiyuan has been successively opened and bought up. At present, the only ones that have not been cleared are a few tea peddlers, among whom those who hoard more goods will open and make their own patterns and sell them directly in Shanghai because the purchase cost is high and they will sell them to the firms at a reduced price. At the moment, several peddlers have implemented self-made and self-sold.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Thin Raincoat Cloth Market is Firmer</h3>
<p>Thick Goods Do Not Move in Hot Weather</p>
<p>Yesterday was Monday, and the Nirong Tongyi Association only had a few transactions in raincoat cloth. The market was sluggish due to the long-term drought. Yesterday, No. 4026 first-class Huishui Mei was sold at 3.75 taels, and No. 2 goods were 3.56 taels. The thinner silver plaid elephant skin lining was more preferred, and the sales price was also quite firm. Yesterday, the first-class goods were sold at 3 taels, and ordinary brands such as Taihe and Madason were all sold at 2.775 taels. Because the weather is hot, customers mostly abandon thick goods and choose thin goods, and there is not much stock, so it can maintain its stable state.</p>
<h3>Non-Ferrous Metals, Lead Prices Drop Again by 2.5 Mace</h3>
<p>Sales are Unusually Sluggish</p>
<p>Since the tea gangs stopped trading, the outlet for lead has decreased sharply. The customer gangs have not dared to purchase recently because the price of domestic lead is very cheap. Paint companies, yellow lead factories, tin foil factories, and type houses are either due to silver relations or because the bottom stock is abundant, so they are all unable to purchase. As a result, transactions in the market are very deserted. The standard is going downstream step by step due to the bad environmental image. Yesterday, the market price fell by 2.5 mace compared to the previous day, and only 11 taels per picul was opened. Transactions were unusually sluggish. It is heard that the overseas fixed price only needs about 10 taels in Shanghai recently, so the standard is not easy to be good for a while.</p>
<h3>Small Split Nail Supply is Tight, Market is Firm</h3>
<p>The Yangtze River Gang's Appetite is Not Weak</p>
<p>The inventory of small split nails has been very scarce recently, so the market price is very firm. It is estimated that 3 points can be estimated to 12.5 taels, 4 points to 13 taels, 5 points to 12.25 taels, and 6 points to 12.4 taels. It is heard that the customer gangs, such as the Yangtze River and Tianjin gangs, are purchasing, and the glassmakers in this street are also embellishing.</p>
<h3>Black Iron Sheet, Northern Gangs Have Already Inquired</h3>
<p>There is Hope for the Price to Rise</p>
<p>Black iron sheet is a popular selling product in the northern road in autumn and winter. However, the northern road this year, such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Beiping, and other gangs, have already inquired, and it is expected that its market will be earlier than in previous years, and there is a tightening trend in the market. The industry generally believes that the future of the market has the hope of rising, so they mutually raise the price and shout high. At the moment, such as 2 feet, 6 feet, 18 sheets of regular goods are estimated to be 9 taels, and secondary goods are 8.5 taels. 3 feet, 6 sheets, 3 sheets to 6 sheets of goods are estimated to be 8.5 taels, 7 sheets to 10 sheets are sold for 9 taels, and 11 sheets or more to 13 sheets are opened for 9.5 taels. Unpopular colors such as 14 sheets and 15 sheets are opened for about 10 taels. According to the market survey, although there is a lot of inventory, the industry is mostly hesitant to order, so the market has the hope of being good.</p>
<h3>Coal, Changxing Coal Sales are Sluggish and the Market is Weak</h3>
<p>Changxing bituminous coal was sold very well in this port last year, but recently it has been affected by the dumping of Japanese coal. The appetite is sluggish. Except for a small part of the contractors who have a slight outlet, there are no transactions in the market. Therefore, the coal is piled up in various warehouses. It is found that there are about 7,000 tons of spot goods in stock, and the market price has fallen as a result. For example, lump coal is now sold for only 8 taels per ton, and coal dust is 6 taels.</p>

<h3>Martial Law Throughout the City Yesterday</h3>
<p>Traffic Between the French and Chinese Concessions Cut Off All Day; Some Disturbances in Various Places, Peaceful Until Late at Night</p>
<p>Yesterday [August 1st] was the International Labor Day (the world proletariat anti-imperialist struggle festival). The city was under special martial law. The iron gates between the Chinese and French Concessions were tightly closed. Streetcars were temporarily suspended. Only a few places had disturbances. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Martial Law Throughout the City</h3>
<p>The police stations in each district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau were ordered that all police officers should be armed and on guard. Double posts were set up on all main roads. All Chinese and Western detectives of the Public Concession police were also on duty. Police cars patrolled the streets from time to time, and the joint defense was tight.</p>
<h3>Traffic Cut Off</h3>
<p>Starting yesterday morning, the French Concession police closed all the iron gates along the boundary between the Chinese and French Concessions, such as Xieqiao, Nanyangqiao, Xiaobeimen, Laobeimen, Xinbeimen, Xiaodongmen, etc. Only Xinkaihe was open to traffic, and Nanyangqiao Laobeimen sidewalks were open to pedestrians. A large number of Vietnamese police were sent to be armed and stationed to inspect pedestrians. The French business bus routes 5, 6, 3, and 18 were all suspended. Public Concession streetcar route 17 stopped at Dashijie, route 14 stopped at Zhengjiamuqiao, and routes 15, 16, and 19 stopped at Sanyangjingqiao. It was not restored until late at night. The Chinese business streetcar company temporarily changed route 2 from Xiaodongmen to Xuejia浜 to route 3 roundabout. The French business water and electricity company specially launched route 18 buses from Xieqiao to Dashijie.</p>
<h3>Disturbances in Various Places</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Concession authorities strictly prohibited gatherings and parades. Therefore, the reactionary elements who planned to gather at the Nanshi Public Sports Ground, Huxi Caojiadu, and Zhabei Meiyuan Road were all stopped, and they were not implemented. In the morning, Zhang Mingqin, the district chief of the Sixth District Police Station, personally led the long police to patrol and seized a large number of reactionary propaganda materials on Bailinan Road and Kaixuan Road, such as [August 1 Special Issue], [August 1 Anti-Imperialist Propaganda], [Aid Niu Lan Declaration], [Workers' Daily], etc. Tao Peng Road in the Hudong District found a gathering of workers, and it was dispersed by the police. In the afternoon, workers and students who distributed leaflets were found in the Public Concession of Zhabei Meiyuan Road and Nanjing Road, and they were stopped. Only a large number of reactionary propaganda materials were seized. The security was very strict in the evening, and there was nothing wrong.</p>
<h3>Eye Police Defense</h3>
<p>Guowenshe said that, except for the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, which sent a large number of Japanese police to defend it, other consulates in Shanghai had no special traces yesterday.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Parading</h3>
<p>Huadong News Agency said that yesterday was the August 1 Memorial Day. At about 4 pm, more than 100 sailors from the Japanese warship Izumo, which was stationed in Shanghai, paraded in formation, going from west to east along the Bund, which was quite surprising to the general public.</p>
<h3>Italian Minister Visited Song Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhang Fuyun Went to Beijing Because of Customs Affairs</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen has been summoning leaders of the local banking industry and directly affiliated agencies of the Ministry of Finance for days to discuss issues such as blocking the Northeast Customs and abolishing the tael for military expenses, but there is no definite solution yet. Yesterday, those who visited Song's residence included Italian Minister Cianne and Finance Vice Minister Zou Lin. There is still no date for the implementation of the blockade. Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Department, went to Beijing because of the blockade of the Northeast Customs. It is heard that the date of Song's departure from Shanghai has not been determined.</p>
<h3>Lin Shi's Return to Beijing Postponed</h3>
<p>Because of Important Official Business, the Trip Was Suspended</p>
<p>Lin Shi, Director of the Postal Department of the Ministry of Communications, has discussed the post office after the blockade of the Northeast with Director Huang Naishu after arriving in Shanghai. Lin Shi was originally scheduled to go to Beijing the night before, but the situation of the postal problem outside the customs was tense again, so he suspended his trip at the last minute and postponed his departure to Beijing. Lin went to Huang Naishu's office yesterday morning to discuss postal issues in secret for a long time. According to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, Lin Shi is scheduled to return to Beijing today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Japan Issued 200 Passports</h3>
<p>Huang Naishu said that the postal staff in the Liaoshen area have been repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side by Postmaster Baridi to apply for passports, which has now been approved, but only 200 have been issued, and the pseudo-country has been ordered to issue them. There are 400 to 500 postal workers in the Northeast who urgently need to enter the customs.</p>
<h3>Strict Arrest of Postal Workers Outside the Customs</h3>
<p>Although the postal workers outside the customs have been ordered to stop working, the Japanese side urged the original postal staff to go to the bureau to work after forcibly taking over, otherwise they would be severely punished. The Japanese side has now issued a notice to the landlords of the postal workers to report to the police station as soon as possible so that they can be arrested.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Sells Japanese Mail</h3>
<p>In Tianjin, Japanese overseas Chinese have been seeking to set up a post office more urgently recently. Yesterday, according to the Xinsheng News Agency, Japanese overseas Chinese in Tianjin planned to formally set up a Japanese post office and issue Japanese stamps. The reason given by the Japanese is that this move is necessary for the convenience of communication between Japanese people. The reporter visited Song Zhumenghou, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Postal Bureau, about this matter. According to his talk, the bureau has also had an informal report on this matter. If there is such a thing, it should be consulted for the Ministry of Communications to file a protest.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers Scattered in Jilin and Heilongjiang</h3>
<p>The postal workers in the Jilin and Heilongjiang districts were under stricter surveillance by the Japanese. After the Administration of that place was ordered to stop, the Japanese immediately sent many policemen to Harbin, surrounded the Administration and the apartments of the staff, and forced the postal staff to work. However, the postal workers in the area were very alert and expected the Japanese to take this action, so they dispersed to other places the day before and were not arrested. Now, the Japanese have limited the postal workers in Jilin and Heilongjiang to go to the bureau to work within three days, otherwise they will be detained in accordance with the laws of the pseudo-country. As a result, all the postal workers are very frightened, change their names and hide in other places, and because they are scattered, there is no organization, so they do not know where they are and there is something to discuss.</p>
<h3>Fifty Postal Workers Arrived in Ping</h3>
<p>According to the Postal Administration, more than 50 postal staff in the Liaoshen District have now safely escaped and arrived in Tianjin, most of whom are lower-level personnel. Postal carriers account for more than half of them, and postal students account for only a small number. The Postal Administration plans to let these people rest for a few days. After the shock is settled, they will be given work again.</p>
<h3>Pan Yunchao Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Talking About the Truth of the Jehol Incident</p>
<p>Central Committee member Pan Yunchao, recently went from Tianjin to Beijing to discuss assisting the volunteer army with Committee member Zhu Jiqing. The discussions have been completed, and he arrived in Shanghai at 8 a.m. yesterday. He immediately went to a friend's place in the French Concession to rest, and also visited Zhu Qinglan and various organizations. After hearing the news, reporters from the New Voice Society drove to visit him, and he told them about the latest situation in the Northeast. It is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>The Japanese Are in a Tight Spot</h3>
<p>Mr. Pan said, "The volunteer armies in various parts of the Northeast, due to a lack of contact and organization in the past, were unable to fight the Japanese army head-on. Therefore, they specialized in guerrilla tactics to contain their activities. Recently, as a result of efforts to engage in liaison and coordination, they have gradually become a strong group. They are only waiting for sufficient ammunition and the start of the green gauze season before they can inflict a major blow on the Japanese army. Currently, the total number of Japanese troops in the Northeast is about 150,000. Their whereabouts are still along the railway lines. The Japanese army is deeply afraid that once the railway is cut, their communication and transportation will be in danger of ending. Therefore, they spare no effort to defend it. However, their intelligence and strength are exhausted, and their embarrassing situation of being tired of running around has been completely exposed."</p>
<h3>Attacking Chaoyang</h3>
<p>Now, the people in the Northeast who have some assets but cannot move temporarily are still dealing with the Japanese, hoping to protect their assets and lives. Otherwise, those who can return to Guan Nei return to Guan Nei, and the rest are willing to defend their homeland and fight the Japanese to the death. As for the Jehol area, since the Japanese army bombed Chaoyang this time, the situation in Jehol is also what the people of the country urgently want to know. Before Jehol was bombed by Japanese planes, Jehol Chairman Yang Yulin still had contacts with the Japanese army on the surface because his property was still in Shenyang. A month ago, Zhang Xueliang, the director of Pingjin Pacification, sent a telegram to Yang Yulin, asking him to state his attitude so as to facilitate contact and assistance, and said that if he colluded with the Japanese, he would sever relations and not provide assistance in the future. Then Tang knew that this matter had to be explained to Zhang Xueliang to avoid misunderstanding, so he sent a representative to Beiping to meet Zhang and report the inside situation. Zhang Xueliang then understood, and the matter was heard by the Japanese, who resented Tang's failure to collude with them. Therefore, they sent a large team of planes twice to bomb Chaoyang, hoping to use intimidation to coerce Yang to obey the Japanese, but they did not succeed. At the same time, Zhang Xueliang also telegraphed Tang to take legitimate defense, and Tang also decided to resist the Japanese army. All of this is the reason before and after the Japanese army's current attempt to peep into Jehol.</p>
<h3>Solid Defense of Pingjin</h3>
<p>In addition, there is something to say about the terrain of Jehol and the situation of the volunteer army. In terms of terrain, Jehol is full of mountains, with undulating ridges and layers of walls. Those who have not seen the situation in Jehol, once they enter the territory, will have the suffering of winding and twisting, and it is difficult to distinguish the direction. Tang has made the most dense arrangements, and the Japanese will never be as easy to spy on as taking the three provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Shenyang. In the case of the volunteer army, the total number in Jehol is more than 200,000. They are all local people who, in view of the tragic situation of the fall of the three provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Shenyang, have risen up and joined the volunteer army. Their weapons and ammunition are well-organized due to careful preparation, and their strength is very strong. Once something happens, they can be dispatched, and they are a strong backing for the formal army. As for the defense of the Pingjin area in North China, as a result of Director Zhang's active planning, it is now extremely solid. Finally, he said that in the process of contacting Zhu Jiqing to assist the Northeast Volunteer Army, all parties enthusiastically supported it. Zhu will go north soon, and he plans to stay in Shanghai for a month to handle assistance matters, etc.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan is Safe</h3>
<p>Ma Guidong's Telegram Report</p>
<p>Ma Kui, the son of Ma Zhanshan, the chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, replied to a certain gentleman, a friend in Shanghai, from Beiping yesterday, saying, "Secret, all received from Dong. Received a telegram recently, the war situation is very good, my father is safe and sound. Ma Kui bows, Dong."</p>
<h3>The Meeting of Citizens on North Sichuan Road Resolved</h3>
<p>Announce to Stabilize People's Hearts</p>
<p>In recent days, in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas, due to the frequent movement of Japanese soldiers, residents are extremely panic, and rumors have arisen that Japanese soldiers will have a second January 28th Incident. Yesterday, many citizens moved from North Sichuan Road, and there was a general feeling of being in danger. The North Sichuan Road Citizens' Branch held an emergency meeting yesterday. Chairman Wang Jian'e discussed the following cases: (1) Rumors in this area have been very strong recently, and many people have moved. A notice should be issued to stabilize people's hearts. (Resolution) Passed, drafted by Wang Jian'e. (2) Soliciting members' notices have been drafted, please discuss the case. (Resolution) Passed. (3) Publish a declaration of unity. (Resolution) Amended and passed. (4) Member Zheng Taixiang asked to collect membership fees and spoke improperly. A warning should be given. (Resolution) Send a letter to inquire and limit the time to reply with a reasonable reason. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>The Society to Abolish Civil War Welcomes Representatives from Hong Kong and Guangdong</h3>
<p>The preparatory committee of the Great Alliance to Abolish Civil War welcomed Cai Chang, the general manager of Daxin Company in Guangzhou, Ma Wenhui, the chairman of the Lu Yishang Association of Hong Kong Import Goods Company, and four gentlemen, Yan Zhifang and Qiu Niantai, at No. 4 Hong Kong Road at noon yesterday. Xu Wan, Liu Zhanen, Qin Runqing, Feng Bingnan, Chen Liting, Cha Mianzhong, Yan Esheng, and others were present. During the meeting, Chairman Liu Zhanen delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Our association previously sent representatives Zhu Ziqiao, Chen Liting, and Cha Mianzhong to Guangdong to discuss the abolition of civil war. Thanks to the guidance and support of Mr. Cai and Mr. Ma in Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Macau, we were able to meet and negotiate with leaders of various groups and circles in the area, and the result was satisfactory, which is very admirable. Now that the two gentlemen and Mr. Yan and Mr. Qiu have come to Shanghai, our association has prepared a small meal to express our gratitude. When the three representatives went to Guangdong, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macau all had slogans welcoming peace envoys. Our association will also use these four words to pay tribute to the four gentlemen, and further hope that the movement to abolish civil war will have a larger and more universal organization, so that compatriots across the country can become peace envoys and unanimously deal with foreign countries. This is what our association deeply hopes for." Then Cai Chang reported on the situation of the contact in Guangzhou, saying that in the past, all circles in Guangzhou inevitably had some doubts about the initiation of the Society to Abolish Civil War. Since the three representatives came to Guangdong to explain, the public has deeply understood. Now they are engaged in preparing to set up a branch, and they are convinced that the people of Guangdong love the country and never lag behind. They will definitely enthusiastically participate in this movement. Ma Wenhui then reported, saying that the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong expressed warm sympathy for the movement to abolish civil war, and believed that abolishing civil strife was a prerequisite for resisting Japan, because it is necessary to settle internally before dealing with foreign countries. In the future, I will follow you all and work together.</p>
<h3>New Site of Shanghai North Railway Station</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Passenger Transport Terminal and the Joint Transportation Station of the Two Railways are Divided into Two Places. Buying and Selling Transfers Within the Section Will be Suspended for Three Weeks Starting Yesterday. The Ministry of Railways Has Sent Xia Guangyu and Chen Yaozu to Investigate Land Prices to Prepare for Purchase. The undecided new site of the North Railway Station has been selected by the Ministry of Railways as the section south of Shida Road, north of Xiangyin Road, and along the southwest 6,000 feet of Zhongshan North Road as the site of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Passenger Transport Terminal. The section west of Zhongshan Road, east of Zhenbei Road, and along the existing railway line, each in the north and south Thousand feet section, is the site of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Joint Transportation Station. The Executive Yuan, according to the Ministry of Railways, presented a decree to the municipal government the day before, and all the above-mentioned sections of the two stations were announced to suspend buying and selling transfers within three weeks from August 1, in order to facilitate surveying and purchasing. After receiving the order, the municipal government, in accordance with the provisions of Article 8, Item 1 of the Land Expropriation Law, believed that this case should be approved by the Ministry of Interior, so in addition to submitting the above situation to the Executive Yuan, it will instruct the Land Bureau today to announce in advance that within three weeks from August 1, all the above-mentioned sections of the two stations will suspend buying and selling transfers, in order to prepare for the Ministry of Railways to send personnel to survey and purchase. The Ministry of Railways has sent Counselor Xia Guangyu and Director Chen Yaozu to investigate land prices in Shanghai to prepare for purchase.</p>
<h3>There Was a Cool Breeze and Drizzle Yesterday</h3>
<p>There Seems to Be Typhoon Weather</p>
<p>Sailboats to Ningbo Suspended</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer in this port, the weather has been extremely sultry, and the thermometer temperature exceeds last year's ratio. However, in recent days, a cool breeze has blown from the southeast, and the clouds in the sky are moving very fast, as if there is a typhoon. Starting yesterday, the wind was quite strong, and the weather was full of clouds, blocking the sun, and there was a drizzle. It felt quite cool to walk on the road. According to the Astronomical Observatory, the source of this cool breeze is a sign that a hurricane is about to arrive. At 4 p.m. yesterday, the Yangjingbang Observatory suspended the ball report. The strongest center point of the hurricane discovered in the Pacific Ocean two days ago has reached 26 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude and 60 miles, located directly east of Fuzhou and the northern end of Taiwan in our country. The wind is moving northwest, so it is expected that there will be storms in that area yesterday, and ships will detour. It is found that this hurricane is now tending towards the sea area of ​​Zhejiang Province in our country. If it does not change direction, it may reach Wenzhou port in the afternoon or evening today, and will reach Shanghai tomorrow. If so, the climate of this port will be cooler in a few days. According to farmers, typhoons in the middle of the heat are beneficial to the autumn harvest.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Sailboats Do Not Sail</h3>
<p>At noon yesterday, Taikoo and Ning Shao Shipping Companies received a report from the Astronomical Observatory, knowing that a strong wind was blowing from the southeast, had reached the sea off Wenzhou, and there was heavy rain, blowing towards the northwest, and the momentum was very rapid. Both Taikoo and Ning Shao were cautious in sailing, and temporarily announced the suspension of the New Beijing and Old Ning Shao (due to the New Ning Shao's repair and replacement) boats that should have been exported yesterday. Passengers who had boarded the ship were refunded their tickets and rescheduled to leave on Wednesday. In addition, Shanghai to Taizhou boats to Chuan Shibu and other places, Shanghai to Wenzhou ferries, etc. were also temporarily suspended from export and postponed the opening date.</p>
<h3>Imported Sailboats Were Blocked</h3>
<p>Commercial boats from coastal ports and the Yangtze River to Shanghai, which arrived at Wusong before 11 a.m. yesterday, all rushed into the Huangpu River and arrived in Shanghai safely. Those who arrived at Wusong after 11 o'clock, because a hurricane and rainstorm had occurred in the sea off Zhejiang and the East China Sea, chose to anchor and temporarily avoid the strong wind, and most of them were the Nanhua ferry and the boats from Japan to Shanghai. Therefore, after 11 a.m. yesterday, there were no boats entering the port, and the commercial boats that had already been exported were temporarily anchored outside Wusong.</p>
<h3>Air Express Mail Can Be Sent Between Saigon and Marseille</h3>
<p>Faster Than Passing Through Siberia</p>
<p>The Zilin Newspaper said that according to the French Oriental Airlines, all air mail sent from Saigon to Marseille and then from there to London can be reached in 14 days, which is more convenient for mail exchanges. Recently, Hong Kong tried to send 15 airmail letters, which were sent on June 7 and arrived in London on June 21, about a week faster than usual via the Siberian Railway. This test was before the Northeast Postal Incident. Today, it can be used. It was found that the mail sent from Hong Kong by the French postal ship Adou No. 2 at 4 p.m. on June 7 arrived in Saigon on June 10, and was carried by plane to Marseille the next day, arriving at 7 p.m. on June 19. It was immediately transported to Paris and handed over to Imperial Airways, and arrived in London on June 21. At present, air services between Saigon and Marseille and the proposed air postal services between Saigon and Hong Kong are two different things. The flight between Saigon and Hong Kong will be tested by the French Oriental Airlines in the near future. The planes used on the Saigon-Marseille air route also carry passengers, mail, and light goods, and fly from Saigon every Saturday morning. According to the postal authorities, all mail specially marked for acceleration will be transported by the Saigon-Marseille air route in addition to the ordinary postage and air postage.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yarn and Cloth Transported to the Yangtze River Has Been Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>Traitorous Merchants Fear and Stop Operating</p>
<p>Just as Japanese goods were being packed, Japanese boats on the Yangtze River were also planning to openly transport Japanese goods on August 1. While ordinary traitorous merchants were actively engaged, there was a sudden warning from the Blood Soul Group, and the outlet of Japanese goods on the Yangtze River and the loading of Toyo yarn and cloth plummeted. The situation yesterday is divided as follows:</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Transport Reduced</h3>
<p>Japanese cotton yarn and piece goods have been transported to the Yangtze River in large quantities since June 26. At the same time, a large amount has also been exported from North China. They are all purchased by traitorous merchants and loaded by Japanese boats. Starting from August , they are planning to openly load them. Therefore, a lot of piece goods loaded from Japan to Shanghai have been recently shipped. When the Blood Soul Group warning occurred, the excited traitorous merchants mostly restrained themselves, and the large amount of piece yarn prepared to be transported to the Yangtze River on August 1 also dared not transport it. Starting yesterday, Japanese boats to the North and South Seas and the Yangtze River no longer loaded large quantities of Toyo yarn and cloth, and the export of other Japanese goods has also been greatly reduced.</p>
<h3>Commercial Boats Refuse to Transport</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a commercial boat in Shanghai also received a warning letter, saying that the boat was acting as a tiger's accomplice, transporting inferior goods, and buying inferior coal. A warning was given first. If it continues to load inferior goods and buy inferior coal for burning, and undertakes the sales responsibility of a certain country's goods invisibly, it will be punished and never forgiven. The boat kept this matter secret, fearing that publicity would hinder business. The letter also stated that those who privately transfer inferior goods to foreign boats for loading will also be treated as traitorous merchants. This matter has been known by some shipping industry peers. Yesterday, each boat bureau notified the crew to carefully check the goods when receiving them, so as not to transport inferior goods in a dark way, so as to avoid accidents.</p>
<h3>The Blood Soul Punishing Traitor Group Attaches Importance to Nanjing Road Stores</h3>
<p>Sincere Company Hopes All Circles Will Go for Investigation</p>
<p>Advising the Nanjing Road Business Federation, Shanghai</p>
<p>The Blood Soul Punishing Traitor Group sent a letter to the Nanjing Road Business Federation yesterday, saying, "Dear Sir, it is found that Nanjing Road holds the commercial hub of this port and is a district where Japanese hate goods gather. If the hate goods on Nanjing Road cannot be eliminated, the work of this group will be equal to zero. Your association is the leading agency for the business community on the road, and it is hoped that you will advise all stores to seal up all hate goods within a week and stop selling them. Otherwise, this group will choose especially one by one to blow them up. Special letter to reach, please check and handle, this to the Nanjing Road Business Federation, Shanghai Blood Soul Punishing Traitor Group, August 1."</p>
<h3>Did Not Warn Two Electrical Appliance Stores</h3>
<p>The Blood Soul Punishing Traitor Group sent a letter to this newspaper, saying, "Public viewing by the editorial department of Shen Bao Newspaper, reading August 1, the article in the local news column of your newspaper, "Shanghai Blood Soul Group Warns the Electrical Materials Industry", is not factual. It is necessary to investigate whether the Freud and Tianfaxie Electrical Appliance Stores sell Japanese goods. This warning letter was obviously issued by someone borrowing the name. This group is not responsible. A special letter is requested for correction. In addition, all external documents of this group must be affixed with a seal to take effect. Combined statement, this to the peace of writing, Shanghai Blood Soul Punishing Traitor Group, August 1."</p>
<h3>Sincere Company Manager's Conversation</h3>
<p>Mr. Zheng, the manager of Sincere Company, said to visitors yesterday, "The company has been calm since receiving the warning from the Blood Soul Punishing Traitor Group, because the remaining Japanese goods have been sealed up long ago. The facts are there, and the conscience is clear. Moreover, they are all compatriots, and they dare not lag behind in patriotic enthusiasm. They are extremely willing for all circles to go for investigation to clarify the truth."</p>
<h3>Customs Starts Levying Surtax</h3>
<p>Effective Yesterday</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance implemented an additional 10% import and export tax last year to relieve the flood in 16 provinces across the country, and reduced the tax by 5% after a year. This regulation has reached the period for reducing the tax on the day before (July 31). However, the Ministry of Finance believed that the current finance was repeatedly affected by other factors and was on the verge of difficulties, and it was not easy to get rid of it by itself. Therefore, it decided to relieve the disaster and the surtax on water disasters was implemented on schedule, and the tax was reduced by 5%.

<h3>There is Yatan Talking About Tariff Issues</h3>
<p>The New Voice Society said that yesterday, the secretary of the Japanese Embassy, ​​Yatan, told reporters that the Japanese side was not prepared to resist taxes by force. This time, Major General Tashiro came to Shanghai to take up the post of military attaché accompanying the Japanese Embassy. The outside world spread that Tashiro convened meetings, etc. Tashiro had no such power. As for the Chinese government's suspension of payment of the Gengzi Indemnity, the Japanese side only saw the report in the newspaper and did not receive a formal notification, so it was inconvenient to express anything. The Japanese side believes that if the reasons taken by the Chinese government for notification are correct, there will be no problem. If it is said that the Japanese side seized tariffs, it is not what Japan is willing to accept.</p>

<h3>Northwest Reclamation Corps</h3>
<p>Investigation Team Departed Yesterday</p>
<p>The Northwest Reclamation Corps investigation team, led by Regiment Leader Yan Ziduan, departed at 9 a.m. yesterday and went straight to Nanjing. There were more than a hundred people at the station to see them off, including the Northwest Frontier Research Association, the Northwest Society, Shengde Factory, Huachang Factory and other business circles, and relatives and friends of various members. After the team departs this time, it is allowed to report the investigation situation to the people of the country at any time, so as to awaken the public's deep understanding of the Northwest problem.

<h3>American Woman Cross Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Evaluating Japan with a Cold Eye</p>
<p>The Mainland Newspaper said that Cross, a famous American writer and lecturer, is known for being familiar with Pacific affairs. Every summer, he organizes a tour group with American students studying Far Eastern issues to tour China and Japan. In addition to visiting the scenery, he also examines history, culture, and visits leaders in the political and academic circles. After touring Japan for two weeks this time, he arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and many Chinese students studying in the United States returned home with him. According to Cross's feelings about Japan, he believes that the current Japanese people are competing with China in a losing sport, and their future will have huge changes. He also discussed the Shanghai War, saying that it would make Japan lose its glory among the Chinese people for 50 years, and it was the most important move to alienate the United States from Japan after the September 18th occupation of Shenyang. The American people will regard Japan's military institutions as thorns in the flesh of the whole world. He saw a clear fear among Japanese businessmen, educators, and farmers, and there was no fear of the current military's adventurous behavior. The destruction suffered by other nations by the Japanese does not move their minds. However, with the military forces expanding, they feel powerless to prevent the final collapse of social order and the bankruptcy of their own culture in the future. It is also said that Japan's military institutions are harmful and will soon bear their disadvantages, because they have aroused the suspicion of other countries and have no choice but to further militarize themselves to defend themselves and deal with other countries. Regarding the feelings of Americans, he said that the United States will not change its current attitude towards Japan's aggression in Asia. Regardless of whether the Republican Party or the Democratic Party holds power, it will never change. Since the Russo-Japanese War, the United States has opposed Japan's expansion to the mainland. When Japan uses force to seek to expand its territory and monopolize trade, the United States will continue to oppose it without any doubt. At present, there are more and more Americans who support recognizing Soviet Russia. He once asked Robin, the leader of the House of Representatives, about the real motivation for the Soviet Russia recognition movement. Robin replied that the Far East situation really promoted it. It can be said that Japanese soldiers lack foresight. If they had treated China with a policy of friendship since the Russo-Japanese War, they would have held the hegemony of Far Eastern commerce today, and no one could be their enemy. Cross and others are now planning to visit Shanghai for four days, take a trip to Hangzhou in the meantime, and then go to Nanjing on Thursday night or Friday morning. They will stay in Ping for some time to investigate the situation in the north.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Urges Hardware Industry to Refrain from Importing Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Hardware Trade Association yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, on the 30th of this month, we received a letter from Yufeng Hardware Store in this city, stating that they read in the newspaper that your association, in order to resolutely resist Japanese goods, convened representatives from various industries, gave face-to-face instructions, and used it as a warning. Our colleagues are gathered at the Broadway Road in Hongkou, and a few colleagues are located in Suzhou River and Xinbeimen. Since the September 18th Incident, unscrupulous merchants have been restrained by the Anti-Japanese Association, so they have taken a little bit of action. After the Shanghai War broke out, the Anti-Japanese Association stopped working, so that general unscrupulous merchants showed their skills in selling Japanese goods again. Therefore, I dare to ask your chairman to send a letter to our industry association, and regularly convene industry representatives to come forward to receive teachings. Then, the future of resisting goods may be saved in case of one ten thousandth. I make a humble request, and I hope that you will approve it, and I will be extremely grateful. I would like to inform you that in the recent days, the hatred of goods has revived in the market. The reason is nothing more than that the general merchants who disregard justice only seek profits, which has led to this. At the time when the bloodstains of the Battle of Shanghai are still fresh and the situation in the Northeast is tight again, all our merchants should vigorously carry out the movement of resisting goods, so that the enemy's flames will be frustrated. Otherwise, if we only seek immediate personal pleasure and ignore national security, drinking poison to quench thirst will only harm ourselves. How can this be tried by our legitimate merchants? According to the previous situation, we should send a letter to your association to check whether colleagues are privately importing Japanese goods, pay close attention to it, and give sincere advice. This is the most important thing."</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Urges Various Industries to Prevent</h3>
<p>Inferior Grass Felt Hats from Being Passed Off as Domestic Goods</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the grass felt hat industry in this city, stated that inferior goods have recently been found on the market that impersonate domestic products, and Hakka customers cannot distinguish them and are deceived. Yesterday, a special letter was sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward it to various dealers to find ways to prevent it. The documents are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Letter from the Grass Felt Hat Trade Association</h3>
<p>Recently, it has been found that there are many inferior goods on the market that are mixed with genuine goods and borrowed the names of foreign merchants to seek meager profits. Moreover, there are even unscrupulous merchants who are so unscrupulous that they print trademarks on inferior felt hats and call them domestic products. Hakka customers cannot distinguish them and are deceived. If we do not rectify the situation urgently and find ways to prevent it, not only will the future of domestic felt hats have no foothold, but also the national economy and people's livelihood will be greatly affected. In view of this, our association has gathered 17 members of felt hat factories in the city and has taken urgent action to pursue and resist, and has established penalty rules to be jointly observed. Now, Shanghai is a central area where all merchants gather for transactions. If you are not careful, malpractices will arise, and the foreign grocery and department store industry is more likely to generate motives. For the sake of guaranteeing the future of domestic products, our association has not only published advertisements, but also applied to your association to send letters to the Department Store Industry Association, the General Merchandise Association, and related industry associations in this city, ordering them to pass on the order to their affiliated industries and pay attention to them. Please do not buy or sell inferior goods to respect the personality of the people. If any violations are found, our association will definitely announce its secret behind-the-scenes operations as much as possible, so that it will not have the support of good public opinion in the business world, and will report to the party and government organs for strict punishment. However, in the areas of various provinces, the location is remote and the road is far away, it is difficult to thoroughly understand the truth of the matter. If one leak is patched and one hundred leaks are missed, it is not a thorough solution. We also implore your association to send the printed notices to the chambers of commerce and domestic goods associations in various provinces, and ask them to forward them to their affiliated business groups for joint verification and retention. We hope that merchants in various places will know what to take and what to discard when purchasing felt hats, so that the future of domestic felt hats will be fortunate, and the domestic goods will be fortunate.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Advises Dealers</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Foreign and Chinese General Merchandise and Department Store Associations yesterday, stating that the felt hat is popular in our country and has always relied on imports. The amount consumed by leaks has been huge throughout the years. In recent years, after the Chinese people have devoted themselves to research, all the felt hats manufactured can be compared with foreign goods, and the prices are low, which is especially popular with the Chinese people. Invisibly, foreign goods have been dealt a major blow. However, according to the letter, some profit-seeking monks dare to change the face of inferior felt hats and pass them off as domestic products to deceive buyers. It is really unscrupulous and destroys the vitality of domestic goods, and should be thoroughly investigated to warn against traitors. According to the previous letter, in addition to separate letters, the original attached notice is enclosed and sent for your reference, and all members should pay attention to it and must not be negligent.</p>
<h3>Important Notice from the Felt Hat Industry</h3>
<p>Respectfully, it is found that our country's industry is backward, which leads to the flooding of foreign goods in the market. Just taking our felt hats as an example, the number of imports each year is no less than 1.5 million yuan. In recent years, the Chinese people have been aware of this and have worked hard to resist it, hoping to stop the leaks. Unexpectedly, at this time of rapid advancement, some merchants who disregard the overall situation have ordered large quantities of inferior goods and sold them on the market under the name of a certain foreign firm to seek meager profits. There are also unscrupulous merchants who add trademarks and labels to inferior felt hats and call them domestic products. All kinds of work to change the face is perfect, so that the domestic felt hat industry is destroyed. Inferior goods are mixed with genuine goods, and they can take the opportunity to import. If we do not rectify the situation and find ways to prevent it, the future of domestic felt hats will have no foothold, and even the national economy and people's livelihood will be greatly affected. The trade association has gathered 17 members of felt hat factories in Shanghai to actively carry out and properly find solutions. First, the trademarks of the 17 companies were published in the newspaper, and letters were sent to party and government organs and business associations and domestic goods associations in various provinces for verification. Afterwards, if any manufacturer has the above-mentioned counterfeiting or代製 and other circumstances, once verified, in addition to publishing a notice in the newspaper, we will request the party and government organs in various provinces to strictly punish them, and the domestic goods organizations to jointly publicize. I am especially worried that when the people of the country purchase and use them, they will not be able to distinguish them and will be deceived. The trademarks of the 17 manufacturers that manufacture genuine domestic felt hats are listed in detail below for easy reference. I hope that patriots will share their wisdom.</p>

<h3>Japanese Merchants in Shanghai Schedule a General Representative Assembly</h3>
<p>To Discuss How to Deal with the Blood Soul Elimination of Traitors Group</p>
<p>According to Shiwenshe, since the Blood Soul Elimination of Traitors Group publicly launched activities, all businesses in this city that deal with Japanese merchants have received severe warnings from the group. All Japanese merchants in Shanghai have been panicked and have sent representatives to ask Consul Murai to negotiate with the city government authorities, requesting effective restraint, but so far there has been no effect. More than ten groups, including the Japan Spinning Factory Federation, the Businessmen's Federation, the Resident Group, and the Commercial Comrades Association, have decided to hold a general meeting of Japanese merchants' representatives at 2:00 PM on the 7th of this month (Sunday) to discuss effective countermeasures. Military and political authorities stationed in Shanghai will send representatives to attend. The following is a special exploration of its notice and the important agenda items for the day:</p>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>In order to save trade in Shanghai, a strong and effective method must be adopted to deal with the Blood Soul Elimination of Traitors Group, which has recently been discovered. However, it is difficult to determine which method should be adopted because the whereabouts of the Blood Soul Elimination of Traitors Group are erratic. It has now been decided to hold a general meeting of Shanghai merchants' representatives at the club (69 Wenjian Shi Road) at 2:00 PM on the 7th of this month. At that time, we hope that you will send two to four representatives to attend on time to discuss all important cases. The matter concerns the lifeline of trade in Shanghai, so please do not take it lightly. This is an urgent notice.</p>
<h3>Minutes</h3>
<p>The agenda items for August 7 are specially attached as follows: (1) Dealing with the Blood Soul Elimination of Traitors Group; (2) Fundamentally abolishing the anti-Japanese movement; (3) Opposing double taxation by the Chinese government; (4) Expanding trade with China; (5) Dumping inventory; (6) Implementing armed protection of freight transportation in the Northeast; (7) Confidential (to be proposed temporarily at the general meeting on August 7); (8) Preparing</p>

All of the above ten important proposals must be discussed and have appropriate policies at the representative assembly on August 7. Therefore, we hope that you will come to attend.</p>

It is now heard that the association has postponed the event due to the urgency of time and insufficient preparation. The date will be announced after it is determined.</p>
<h3>A Suspicious Woman Was Caught for Distributing Leaflets</h3>
<p>Between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM yesterday, communists in Zhabei, from the Maigen Road Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to the intersection of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, distributed reactionary leaflets in various places. When they saw a train passing by, they threw them into the train. Later, the Tanziawan Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau learned about it and sent police to the area. The communists dispersed and only caught Fan Xiaomao, a 17-year-old woman. After taking her to the district, Fan claimed that she lived at No. 44 Yixing Lane, Changan Road. Because she went out to buy groceries in the morning, she picked up the above leaflets on the ground and planned to take them back to wrap copper coins. She was not a communist. After reviewing the confession, the district officer judged that the case was suspicious, so he sent her to the Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>
<h3>Ministry of the Interior Changes the Method of Issuing Physician Certificates</h3>
<p>Approved by the National Physicians Association</p>
<p>The National Physicians Association previously stated that the Ministry of Health's Provisional Regulations for Physicians and the Legislative Yuan's revised Regulations for Western Physicians were difficult to implement and out of date, and the association repeatedly requested amendments. It is now heard that the Ministry of the Interior's Department of Health has drafted two temporary measures for the issuance of certificates to physicians, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan and approved at the 49th meeting on July 12. The amended regulations and the public letter from the Ministry of the Interior's Department of Health to the association are as follows: [Respectfully, according to the files in the case, we previously approved your association's letter, stating that there is a shortage of physicians and requesting that we follow the precedents of advanced countries and start with leniency, etc. Now, our department has drafted two temporary measures for the issuance of certificates: (1) Graduates of unapproved medical schools who have graduated for more than four years, and whose school's curriculum and facilities have been examined and deemed perfect by this department, and who graduated before the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations for Physicians in the 18th year; (2) Those who have been recognized by this department as having perfect facilities. Hospitals, practicing for more than five years, and who have been practicing before the 18th year, have been issued a medical license or certificate by the competent authorities in the place where they are located, and have proven to have the ability to practice medicine, and have been verified to be free of differences, will be temporarily allowed to issue certificates once only, and no precedents will be set in the future, which will be reported by the department to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. It has now been proposed by the Executive Yuan at the 49th meeting this month and resolved and approved. In addition to the Ministry issuing orders to various provinces and cities to specifically order them to handle the matter, and issuing separate letters, a corresponding letter is hereby sent to inform you that we hope you will investigate and be informed.], etc.</p>

<h3>Party and Government Organs Advise Incense Industry Workers to Resume Work First</h3>
<p>Treatment Conditions Will Await Legal Mediation</p>
<p>The Labor Union Requests a Petition Today to Hold a General Meeting</p>
<p>After the incense industry workers in this city went on strike, the Pudong District resumed work the day before yesterday. The labor union was able to petition the party and government organs and decided to hold a general meeting today. The situation has eased. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Labor Union Petition</h3>
<p>The Incense Industry Occupational Labor Union dispatched directors Shi Ziqing and Zhou Weixin to the Municipal Party Department to petition at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Li Weixiong of the Civil Training Section received them and promised to work with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to find a way to mediate and advised the workers to resume work first. Then they went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to petition, where Wang Bing of the Third Section received them and explained and criticized the reasons for the conditions put forward by the labor union. He said that the conditions for improving treatment put forward by the incense industry must be before the Shanghai Incident. After the incident, various industries were extremely depressed and no longer applicable. Moreover, the Municipal Government had issued a notice advising labor and management to coordinate and cooperate, and advised the workers to resume work first and wait for legal mediation.</p>
<h3>Today's General Meeting</h3>
<p>Regarding the advice of the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau to resume work first and wait for mediation, the Incense Industry Occupational Labor Union believed that the matter was of great importance and specifically scheduled a general meeting of members at 91 Daji Road at 10:00 AM today to discuss and decide on a policy. Yesterday, it had submitted a request to the party and government organs to send personnel to provide guidance at that time. It is heard that the authorities have approved the convening and that the Public Security Bureau will send police to protect it.</p>
<h3>Northeast Telegrams Have Long Been Blocked</h3>
<p>Zhong E Talks About the So-Called Blockade</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Northeast telecommunications, since the September 18th Incident, it has been almost entirely plundered by the Japanese, leading to rumors that our side will implement a blockade of Northeast telecommunications. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency interviewed Zhong E, the director of the Telecommunications Department, yesterday. According to him, Northeast telecommunications can be divided into wired and wireless. Wired telecommunications are directly under the control of the central government, while wireless telecommunications are mostly for military use and are directly managed by the Northeast authorities. After the September 18th Incident, our telecommunications were seized by the Japanese. Wireless telecommunications cannot be communicated, and wired telecommunications, except for the Commercial Daily, cannot be communicated. Even if there are reports, they must be forwarded from Tianjin to Harbin and then sent to various places. Whether or not they are intercepted on the way and can directly reach is still not guaranteed. All countries communicate with the Northeast after the September 18th Incident. Our side has protested to them and asked them to stop communicating. Various countries maintain the old contract and do not communicate with the puppet state with a new treaty. However, the puppet state is definitely not the legitimate successor of China and cannot continue the old contract. Our diplomatic authorities are already negotiating. Most of our telecommunications personnel in the Northeast have returned to Guan Nei. Under such circumstances, the relationship with the puppet state has been severed invisibly, and there is no so-called blockade. As for the issue of the circulation of the Commercial Daily, although there is no major obstacle, in order to be cautious, the Ministry of Communications has specially asked the Telecommunications Department to study which Commercial Dailies can circulate and which Commercial Dailies cannot. There is still no result.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul Murai Will Be Transferred Back to His Country</h3>
<p>Jilin Consul General Ishiya Will Succeed Him</p>
<p>Murai, the Japanese Consul General stationed in Shanghai, has been summoned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will be transferred back to his country in the middle of this month. His successor has been decided to be Ishiya Jotaro, the current Japanese Consul General stationed in Jilin. In addition, Shirai Kou, the newly appointed Japanese Consul General in Hangzhou, is said to be a concurrent position. He arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou the day before yesterday. According to reports, since the Shanghai Incident, the Japanese expatriates there have returned to their country, and no one has returned to Hangzhou. Since Consul Shirai returned to Shanghai, there has been no Japanese expatriate in Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>The Red Cross Society Distributes Rice in Sijiangkou</h3>
<p>Sijiangkou, Jiading County, was originally an important transportation route by water and land, and the market was prosperous. Since it was affected by the war, the merchants and people have been suffering greatly, and there is almost no food to cook. The charity community in Shanghai, including Wen Lanting, has agreed with the Red Cross Society to allocate 200 bags of rice for distribution and send personnel to conduct door-to-door investigations and issue rice tickets. Yesterday, rice was distributed according to the tickets at the Fumin Rice Mill in Sijiangkou, and the villagers were very grateful.</p>
<h3>The Extra-Territorial Road Construction Case Will Be Discussed Again Next Wednesday Is Incorrect</h3>
<p>Secretary-General Yu's Talk</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of extra-territorial road construction, it was reported in the newspaper yesterday that Feixin Dun, the director-general of the Public Works Bureau, will meet with Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Yu Hongjun again next Wednesday to continue the discussion. A reporter from the Central News Agency asked Secretary-General Yu about this matter yesterday. According to Yu's reply to the reporter, he has not heard of continuing the discussion next Wednesday. During the recess of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Bureau, he will continue to discuss the matter. As of tonight (that is, last night), he has not received a notice from Feixin Dun. The reporter also learned from another source that the main body for resolving the extra-territorial road construction this time is the Municipal Government and the Public Works Bureau. The Public Works Bureau submitted the draft agreement on the case to the consular corps only because the case is also closely related to foreign residents, so it followed the example of submitting the draft agreement to the consular corps to solicit its opinion. The Public Works Bureau is only responsible to all taxpayers and has no direct relationship with the consular corps. Therefore, the agreement on the recovery of extra-territorial road construction does not need to be approved by the consular corps.</p>
<h3>Opinions on the Abolition of Taels and the Adoption of Yuan in Various Industries</h3>
<p>The New Currency Must Have a Moderate Price</p>
<p>The Conversion Ratio Should Be Publicly Determined</p>
<p>Public Inspection and Supervision of Issuance</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Association and other associations replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, saying: "Respectfully, we have received your letter asking about the three questions regarding the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, there has never been a complete and unified system of currency in our country. The five-zhu and three-zhu leather coins and paper money were extremely chaotic. The Qing Dynasty had its own minting, and the quality was inconsistent, so the credibility was different. Since the Revolution, the provinces have been in power, the number of minting institutions has increased, and the types of currency have become more and more complicated. Even if the land is adjacent, the suggestion of abolishing taels and adopting yuan to unify the currency system has been advocated for 15 years. However, it has not been realized due to frequent political changes, which is a pity in public opinion. At this time when the price of li is plummeting and the industry and commerce are feeling the dark losses, the policy of abolishing taels and adopting yuan is even more of an urgent plan for the social people. However, things in the world are often beneficial and harmful, so at the beginning of the reform, we must consider carefully and not rush to do things. Recently, people in the financial industry and economists have discussed this issue. Although there are differences in opinions, the principle of eliminating abuses must be a common opinion of all sectors. I am honored to be consulted, and I will offer some humble opinions as far as I can see, which may also be welcomed by the wise public of your association. The first point of the letter is about the fineness and weight of the new currency. Liu Hongsheng and Geng Aide in the research association have expressed their views. However, the three must meet the moderate price of the current old currency of the foreign li. If it is too high, the new currency will be eliminated, and if it is too low, the production price will be easily affected. Fortunately, the Ministry of Finance has already stated that it will never seek profit in the minting factory. This is what we hope that your association and the social people will supervise the government from beginning to end and fulfill the promise. The second point is about the ratio of silver contracts to silver coins. Except for the major trading ports along the coast of the Yangtze River, there are few cases where silver units are used to sign contracts. In the inland market, it can be said that there are very few. Therefore, the ratio of silver contracts to silver coins during the current effective period may solicit the opinions of both debtors to determine a transitional method. This is what we hope that your association will convene the Silver Money Association and related industries to properly determine a method. In view of this change, if you want the society and the public to understand and trust it, this depends on the government's prestige. No one dares to affirm it in turn. Today's doubts about the government are nothing more than a few points, such as worrying about no preparation, no ability to unify the right to issue, indiscriminately minting inferior coins, indiscriminately issuing banknotes, concentrating cash, and suddenly stopping redemption. These kinds of malpractices do have the need to worry about. The government authorities, if they sincerely want the society and the public to understand and trust them, then they should ask themselves and take precautions in advance. If the minting of hard currency must be made public to see whether the quality is accurate, and the issuance of banknotes must be publicly inspected to see whether the preparation is sufficient, unify the minting institutions and eliminate the occurrence of inferior coins. All of these points are waiting for your association to lead the business community, organize a supervisory agency, and urge its implementation. In short, the change of the monetary system belongs to the scope of national administration, and it may be implemented on a regular basis with a single order. Only because it is a major plan for the reform of social and economic development, we should not hesitate to consult extensively and aim for perfection. If the above-mentioned sections can be linked together and determined, then the policy of abolishing taels and adopting yuan to unify the monetary system will be promoted to the greatest benefit. Otherwise, a slight mistake will lead to a great difference. If the benefit is not seen, abuses will have sprung up. Is this what the society and the public are happy to hear? The letter is sent to you for the above reasons, and we hope that you will check it out. This is addressed to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Sugar Industry, the Cotton Cloth Industry, the Rice Store Industry, the Silk Brocade Industry, the North-South Goods Exchange Industry, the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, the Color Printing Industry, the Mineral Ash Factory Industry, the Fly Ash Industry, and the Intestine Industry Association.

<h3>Establishment of a Medical Bureau in Zhuanqiao Town</h3>
<p>Zhuanqiao Town, located west of Shanghai and spanning the Songjiang and Shanghai counties, is relatively developed in commerce due to its convenient transportation. The local gentry, Zhou Yue and He Qiu, considering the years of famine and the devastation of the people's livelihood, and especially the likelihood of a major epidemic after a large-scale military conflict, and that many residents in the vicinity were suffering from illness but were unable to afford medical treatment due to economic hardship, in order to promote social well-being, jointly organized a medical bureau with Lu Faxin and Ma Youliang from the Zhuanqiao Town Office in the Fourth District of Songjiang County. They invited more than 20 renowned doctors to provide medical treatment starting from the third day of the sixth lunar month at the Zhenqiao Primary School, which served as the bureau's location. The schedule was set for the 3rd and 8th days of each month, and each session attracted over a thousand patients. Free medicine was provided to the poor and sick. The original plan was to end after six sessions, but due to the large number of patients seeking treatment, it was necessary to extend the period. With the consent of the doctors, it was decided to extend it for two more sessions, ending on the eighth day of the seventh lunar month.</p>
<h3>Shen Zhongyi Appointed Manager of Sanbei Company</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau Supervises the Repair of Wusong River Ferries</h3>
<p>Five Ferries Repaired</p>
<p>Commendation Issued</p>
<p>There are a total of thirteen privately-operated ferries on the Wusong River in this city. They used to use ordinary barges to carry passengers. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau registered them in the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929] and reorganized them. All ferries were required to build new boats according to the specified drawings. The following year, they were ordered by the Public Utilities Bureau to add auxiliary boats as backup and to increase the number of trips when passengers were crowded. After the war this year, when the ferries resumed operation, the bureau found that except for one at Tanziwan, the paint on the other ferries was peeling off and the boats were dilapidated. They were ordered to repair and repaint them to maintain their appearance and avoid danger. It is now learned that the five ferries at Tongji Road, Hanzhong Road, Guangzhao Road, Guangfu Road, and Panjiawan have been repaired as ordered. The bureau sent personnel to inspect them and found that the ten main and auxiliary ferries, both inside and outside, the paint on the railings and the awning supports were clean and in good condition. The bureau believes that the ferry operators have earnestly complied with the city's regulations on ferries over the years and have contributed greatly to improving transportation. Therefore, they have been issued commendations.</p>
<h3>Air Conditioning Room Worker Electrocuted</h3>
<p>One Dead, Six Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 5 p.m., seven workers in the air conditioning room of the Nanjing Road small market accidentally touched an electric wire while moving iron plates, resulting in electrocution.

<h3>Shen Jitu Accused of Abandoning Wife for Concubine</h3>
<p>His Wife Makes Four Demands</p>
<p>Shen Jitu, son of Shen Qiquan, a former Qing Dynasty scholar, married Ms. Huang Zhaohua in the 12th year of the Republic [i.e., 1923] through the matchmaking of Zhang Yipeng and Huang Yanpei. At first, their relationship was harmonious, and Huang gave birth to a daughter the following year. However, after Shen Jitu entered officialdom, he repeatedly obtained favorable positions, accumulated wealth, and became increasingly wealthy. He then built a gilded cage to keep a concubine for his pleasure, gradually becoming indifferent to his wife. This spring, when the anti-Japanese war broke out in Shanghai, Jitu was residing on the sea, but he only took his beloved concubine with him to the Jing'an Villa, abandoning his legal wife. Later, although Huang tried to join him, he refused to let her in, practicing the principle of "when disaster strikes, each flies his own way." At that time, Huang was pregnant and almost died of anger. Fortunately, her father was by her side and felt that Jitu's behavior was unreasonable. He decided not to argue with him for the time being and first persuaded his daughter to leave and stay at the Qianji Hotel for medical treatment. Later, he began to negotiate with Jitu, but he ignored him and treated him like a stranger. Now, Huang's illness has been cured, but she is about to give birth, and it is not a long-term solution to continue wandering. Therefore, she hired attorney Xuan Zhendong to file a petition with the First Special District Court, requesting mediation. However, Shen Jitu failed to appear in court, and the mediation could not proceed. Huang then officially filed a lawsuit, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay: (1) 40 yuan per month for living expenses from February 1st of this year, calculated for ten years, totaling 4,800 yuan. In addition, 1,000 yuan for childbirth expenses and the child's living expenses. (2) Return the plaintiff's clothes and utensils. (3) Return the adopted daughter, Nannan, whom the plaintiff brought. (4) Order the defendant to bear the litigation costs. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Hong opened the court to summon the defendant, but he still did not appear. The plaintiff, Huang Luhua, stated that she was 25 years old and currently residing at No. 15, Guanhua Lane, Lafayette Road. The defendant, Shen Jitu, had previously served in Anchang, Yidong, and other customs positions and is now a county magistrate. It is said that he has gone to Shaanxi on official business. In the past, he used to give 10 to 20 yuan of pocket money per month, but he has not given any money recently. The daughter I gave birth to died early, while the concubine has two daughters and one son. After the defendant's attorney and the plaintiff's attorney debated with each other, the judge ordered a change of date for further verification.</p>
<h3>Not a Factory Girl, but a Bride</h3>
<p>Husband Follows Behind and Realizes the Truth</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller Wang Deyi from Taixian, whose wife Wang Wang, 22 years old, is attractive. Recently, due to financial difficulties, Wang Wang planned to work in a factory. Gu San and Zhu Jin acted as introducers, claiming to introduce her to work at the pig farm on Yidingpan Road. They took her there three times to make contact, but each time they said the manager was not there. The day before yesterday, they came to Wang's house again, saying the manager wanted to see her. Wang Wang changed her clothes and went out with them. Wang Deyi saw his wife dressed up and realized it was not like going to work, so he secretly followed behind. Unexpectedly, they went to Wang Nanting's house near the pig farm, and there were already many people gathered at the door, saying they were there to see the bride. Wang Nanting's house was in a state of celebration. At this point, Wang Deyi realized that his wife had been sold. He immediately called the police, and Gu, Zhu, and Wang Nanting were arrested in the Sixth District. Yesterday, they were sent to court for investigation.</p>

<h3>One-Year Imprisonment for Seducing a Female Worker</h3>
<p>Yang Simei, a woman from Pudong, 19 years old, worked as a female worker at the Yihe Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road. In April of this year, she was stalked, seduced and made fun of by Xie Ada, a rascal from Jiangbei, who waited near the entrance of the cotton mill every day after work. Yang, from Pudong, had little experience and was thus charmed. On the 27th, the two of them went to Wuxi together and rented a house at No. 5 Guangqin Road, where they lived together as husband and wife. However, Yang's travel expenses were limited. After living there for about a week, she ran out of money. Shen Zhang, a woman who lived in the same house, told Yang to return to Shanghai because Xie Ada planned to take Yang to Fujian to sell her. Therefore, Yang insisted on forcing Xie to return to Shanghai on May 24th. Because she was ashamed to go home, she stayed temporarily at her relatives' place at No. 19 Tongzhou Road. Yang Shunjin, her father, opened a burlap sack store in Pudong. After his daughter disappeared, he searched for her everywhere. He had previously received a report from a friend surnamed Mou, saying that he had seen Yang Simei in Wuxi and that she had returned to Shanghai. The morning before yesterday, Yang Shunjin met his daughter on Wuzhou Road, learned the details, and reported it together to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. The head of the report, Liu Junjie, was sent to arrest Xie Ada and bring him to the police station. The next morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and said that the defendant had previously been prosecuted for flirting with his daughter, and therefore requested severe punishment. Subsequently, Yang Simei and her father, Yang Shunjin, explained the details of the incident and questioned the defendant. He stammered in his confession and claimed that Yang Simei was introduced to him by his cousin and that it cost him dozens of silver dollars, and that it was not seduction. Judge Chuan Lin examined the confession clearly and declared to the defendant that he did not need to argue and sentenced Xie Ada to one year of imprisonment to deter others. Yang Simei was returned to her father for custody.</p>
<h3>Power Outage in the French Concession</h3>
<p>At approximately 0:55 AM this morning, the lights suddenly went out in the area of Lafayette Road, Ximen Road, and Malong Road in the French Concession, plunging the area into darkness.

<h3>Private Possession of Sulfur Punished</h3>
<p>Dingyu Seafood Store at No. 38 of a foreign firm in the French Concession was found to be privately storing the banned substance sulfur by the Jiangsu Provincial Nitre and Sulfur Branch Office for Special Districts. The director of the bureau sent Yang Yucheng, the head of the business department, to report to the French Concession Police. Detective Jin Mingxiang was sent to search the store and found 14 catties of sulfur, along with the store clerk Chen Shumei. They were taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special District Court. The police prosecuted them for the public danger crime under Article 201 of the Criminal Law. Chen confessed that he had bought it last year and used it to whiten white fungus. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. The trial was concluded, and yesterday Judge Xiong Huiping presided over the First Criminal Court and sentenced Chen Shumei for the crime of assisting in the unauthorized possession of explosives and specially fined him 120 yuan. If he could not pay the fine, he would be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan. The number of days of detention before the judgment was finalized would be offset by two yuan per day. The sulfur was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Morphine Hidden in Luggage</h3>
<p>Turns Out It Wasn't Weapons</p>
<p>The Shanghai Garrison Command recently received a tip that multiple packages of pawned luggage from Yutaiyi Pawnshop were stored in the cargo room of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway South Station. It was alleged that a large amount of weapons was hidden inside and entrusted to the Public Welfare Transportation Company for transportation to Hangzhou to support bandits. After learning about the above situation, the Command sent Inspector Yang Bin to the South Station at 6 PM the night before last to inspect the cargo warehouse together with the Railway Police Department. Since the iron gates of the cargo warehouse were locked that night, the Railway Police Department temporarily detained the cargo. At 12 PM yesterday, Yang Bin, the inspector of the Command, led detectives and soldiers to the South Station to jointly inspect the cargo with Zhang Shuping, the deputy director of the Railway Police Department, Zhou Fusheng, the stationmaster of the Transportation Department, cargo inspectors, and Liu Shaoqing, the foreman of the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Liu Xueli, the patrol chief of the Second District Police Station. Because the smuggling of weapons to support bandits was a serious matter, soldiers of the Command were heavily armed around the cargo room of the station. As a result, four clothing packages from Hengfeng Pawnshop, four from Yufeng Pawnshop, one from Yutai Pawnshop, and four from Yutaiyi Pawnshop were seized. A large amount of morphine weighing seven kilograms was seized from the Yutaiyi clothing packages, divided into five silk bags and two cloth bags, with a total weight of more than 120 taels, worth approximately 3,000 yuan. Each of the other clothing packages contained a large number of inferior goods, leather goods, and cloth, but no weapons. The Command sent the four Yutai clothing packages and Ke Lizhi, the clerk of the pawnshop, to the Command for interrogation, along with the morphine. The other clothing packages contained more than a dozen pieces of leather goods, which were declared as fourth-class goods and transported at fourth-class freight rates. The railway authorities believed that according to the regulations, leather goods must be charged at first-class freight rates, so they considered it a case of fraud and detained all the clothing packages of the pawnshops, ordering the cargo owners to pay the supplementary fine according to the regulations. The item of inferior goods must be submitted for review.</p>
<h3>Extortion in Connection with Assassination</h3>
<p>Claiming to be a Government Official, Swindling Money, Zhong Liansong Reports to the Police to Arrest the Criminal</p>
<p>Cao Qing, an inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, was assassinated by thugs on Carre Road in the French Concession. Director Wen recently received a confidential report from citizen Chen Er, stating that the main culprit in the case was Zhong Liansong, who is now a foreman in the telephone bureau in the Concession. Director Wen instructed the Inspection Department to investigate the case thoroughly. On the 30th of last month, a man suddenly came to Zhong Liansong's house on Hanzhong Road in Zhabei, claiming to be Shen Bin, an investigator in a certain bureau. Zhong invited him in, and Shen said that the Detective Team of the Public Security Bureau wanted to arrest him because he was the main culprit in the assassination of Inspector Cao. If he was arrested, his life would be in danger. Shen said that he was not bragging and that he had evidence to prove it. He handed over a letter from a certain person reporting to a certain bureau. The letter stated that Zhong was the main culprit in the assassination. Zhong was shocked and replied that he was a legitimate worker and would never do such a thing. He asked Shen not to misunderstand. Shen said that it was no use, as people were accusing him. He asked how he could deal with it. Shen said that he knew that Zhong was a good person, so he came to inform him. Zhong repeatedly begged Shen to find a way to intercede with the Public Security Bureau to avoid his arrest. Shen agreed immediately and arranged to meet at the Little World Amusement Park in the city at around 9 PM the next night. Because he had mistakenly identified Zhong's face, he told Zhong to carry a flashlight as proof when he went. Zhong agreed. Shen then left. Afterwards, Zhong realized that Shen was clearly trying to extort money, so he reported it to the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and asked them to arrest him. Because the matter involved impersonating a public official and extorting money, Detective Wang Shenqing, along with the police chief of the First District Second Police Station, disguised themselves as coolies and went to the Little World Amusement Park at around 8 PM. Zhong took a flashlight and went to the amusement park to keep the appointment. Before long, Shen came leisurely. After they greeted each other, they began to negotiate. Shen said that he needed 300 yuan to withdraw the case and prevent Zhong from being arrested. Zhong pretended to negotiate and reduce the amount, and at the same time scratched his head wildly (this was a pre-arranged signal with the detectives). At that moment, the detectives who were lying in ambush in the four places rushed forward, arrested Shen, and took him to the Second Police Station of the First District for questioning.</p>

<h3>Russian Detective Arrested for Pawning a Gun</h3>
<p>Bert (transliteration), a Russian secret agent previously employed by the First District General Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was dismissed from his position some days ago. At that time, he did not return a handgun with a certain serial number and 180 bullets that he had received. Wang Zhenbang, the district chief of the First District, reported this to the General Office, and Director Wen ordered him to be urged to return it. However, the Russian detective Bert repeatedly evaded and said that he had served near the war zone during the Shanghai war and was afraid of being discovered by the Japanese, so he hid the gun in a grassy area. Later, another detective learned that the Russian had pawned the handgun to a foreigner for 50 yuan. Wang Zhijing, the section chief of the Second Section of the bureau, sent section member Zhou Ding, along with another Russian detective, Raibidefu (transliteration), to the Second Special District Court to request a warrant. They went to Bert's residence at No. 106 Hualong Road with Russian and Chinese detectives from the French Concession Police, but were unable to find him. They were later arrested at the French General Association. The Russian was sent to the Lujiawan Police Station and has been transferred to the Second Special District Court for interrogation. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent Zhou Ding and others to the court to welcome him. However, the Russian Bert denied the gun pawning incident. The Second Special District Court notified the Public Security Bureau to instruct the pawnee to appear in court to provide proof, and then it could be transferred. It is heard that the bureau has ordered Wang Zhenbang, the district chief of the First District, to notify the pawnee to appear in court to testify.</p>
<h3>Light Bulb Falls in Barber Shop</h3>
<p>Injures Customer...Authorities Punish</p>
<p>The Zhoudeji Barber Shop at the intersection of Mingguo Road, Guanyin Street, and Baojiang Alley in the city had a light bulb fall and injure a customer's head the other day. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau sent personnel to investigate after receiving a report. The barber shop had renovated the shop downstairs this year and hired an unlicensed electrician to rewire the electrical equipment in order to save money. At that time, it did not report to the China Electric Company and request the bureau's inspection before using it. This resulted in the light bulb and the magnet falling at the same time, injuring the customer. This was in violation of the city's regulations on inspecting the electrical equipment in public places. In addition to notifying the electric company to temporarily suspend the power supply, it was also punished. The electrical equipment will be reconnected after it has been improved, reported, and inspected and approved.</p>
<h3>Record of the General Meeting of Tenants in Yuqing and Qixiu Neighborhoods</h3>
<p>The tenants of Yuqing and Qixiu neighborhoods on North Sichuan Road held a general membership meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Over two hundred people attended, with Zhang Chiseng of the Shanghai Citizens' Rent Reduction Committee present. The meeting was chaired by Jiang Wenbao, and formalities were observed. (A) Wei Langxuan reported on the progress of negotiations. (B) Discussions included: (1) How to handle the exemption of rent in war zones. A resolution was passed in principle. (2) The issue of organizing a special committee. It was resolved to appoint seven people, including Jiang Wenbao, to be responsible for conducting negotiations. (3) Given that this neighborhood is at the forefront of the conflict, in a particularly dangerous and precarious area, with massive casualties and losses, and that housing repairs will not be completed until early June, with tenants only returning to settle in July, it was resolved that rent payments should begin in August. (4) The issue of the management office taking advantage of the situation to exert pressure, such as filing lawsuits for rent arrears. It was resolved that all members would stand united to achieve their goals, sharing the costs of legal representation. The minimum demand is for rent exemption starting from July. (5) What to do if the management office sends personnel to forcibly collect rent for May, June, and July. It was resolved to inspect the rent receipts and pay according to whether they are for August or July; otherwise, to refuse payment collectively and deposit the rent for July and August into a bank to avoid accusations of rent arrears. (6) As the houses in Qixiu neighborhood are still under construction and not yet completed, it was resolved that the start of rent collection should not be treated the same as other areas, and the matter was entrusted to a special committee. (7) Zhang Chiseng, representative of the Municipal Rent Reduction Committee, provided guidance, with the wording omitted here for brevity. The meeting adjourned with tea and refreshments at noon.</p>
<h3>News on the Rent Dispute in Chongshan Neighborhood, Tangshan Road</h3>
<p>Previously, the tenants of Chongshan Neighborhood argued that the rent rates had increased several times after the renovation of the neighborhood. Following the Shanghai Incident, all industries declined, and even with frugality, tenants were struggling to make ends meet, making the high rent unaffordable. Therefore, they collectively decided to write to the landlord, earnestly requesting a reduction or exemption of rent as relief. Unexpectedly, the landlord not only showed no sympathy but also filed a lawsuit for rent arrears in the First Special District Local Court. Upon investigation, the neighborhood was only renovated and completed in mid-April of this year. The landlord had verbally agreed that rent would start in May, and tenants had prepaid one month's rent at the time of the agreement. The outstanding rent for June was deposited in the bank because the landlord refused to reduce the rent as requested. Therefore, this case is purely about rent reduction and not a dispute over arrears. The case was heard twice on July 26th and 29th. The judge, considering the complexity of the rent reduction issue, briefly questioned the plaintiff's name and then instructed the tenants' lawyer, Guo Qiming, to gather evidence for a scheduled rehearing. Currently, the tenants are not only appealing to all sectors for assistance but also collecting evidence to argue their case reasonably. During the previous hearing, many residents from Tangshan Road and the surrounding areas went to the courtroom to observe. It is certain that the next hearing will be even more crowded than before because the matter concerns housing, which is a pressing issue for all.</p>

<h3>British and American Workers Request Cancellation of Factory Management Rules</h3>
<p>The authorities of the British American Tobacco Company in this city formulated 23 articles of factory management rules this year, which have been implemented since the first of last month. Workers in both the new and old factories of the company in Pudong consider these rules extremely harsh. For example, laughing or speaking in the factory will result in one demerit and one day of suspension. In addition to deducting meal expenses, one demerit will also be recorded. There are many other offenses that lead to demerits. Accumulating three demerits results in one major demerit, and accumulating three major demerits leads to dismissal. Furthermore, the most severe rule is that the factory has the right to dismiss workers at will. Therefore, the workers believe that not only is it extremely difficult to work in the factory, but they also lose their inherent protection. This treatment is even harsher than during the warlord era, and they can no longer endure it. They have been going to the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union to question the reasons for the Social Affairs Bureau's approval and demand that the rules be canceled. After several discussions, the union believes that these harsh rules contradict the Factory Law and the labor-management mutual assistance agreement signed between the union and the factory in 1927. It has decided to convene an emergency meeting of all representatives from both factories on the afternoon of the 4th of this month to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Two Actors Sued for Rent Arrears</h3>
<p>Actors Jia Biyun and Liu Xiaoheng live together in Tongde Lane on Route Wagner in the French Concession. Recently, due to squatters occupying the lane and the street sweepers failing to remove the garbage, they withheld rent as a means of pressuring the landlord to clean up the lane and remove the garbage. Now, the agent, Shen Jikang, has hired lawyer Fang Jiahe to sue them in the Second Special District Court for accumulating four months of rent arrears. Judge Li Aiyi held a hearing yesterday, summoning the parties. The plaintiff and the lawyer appeared in court to state the circumstances and request compensation. Jia Biyun's wife appeared on his behalf, and Liu was represented by lawyer Wang Jishi. The court ordered a postponement for further review.</p>
<h3>Guanshengyuan Opens Fourth Branch</h3>

Operations began in the spring of this year, with the construction of a new three-story building. The downstairs business area imitates the scale of the main store, while the second and third floors have been developed into new-style tea rooms and ice cream parlors to provide a place for people to rest and enjoy snacks, refreshments, and cold drinks. The interior and exterior renovations are nearing completion, and the grand opening is scheduled for the 3rd of this month, with business starting on the 4th. The storefront will offer a two-week sale on candies and foods in commemoration.</p>
<h3>Lotus Society Relocates to Give Lectures</h3>

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>We have read a report in your newspaper about an accusation of seduction and fraud. The accused is Sheng Shen Geng, the owner of Ruichang Shengji Money Exchange on Tianjin Road, who is described as an old scoundrel. This is not consistent with the facts. Although such a person exists in our exchange, he is not an old scoundrel. He has long been on leave and no longer holds a position. We are writing to request that this letter be published in your letters to the editor column.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Ruichang Shengji Money Exchange, August 1, 1932</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>We have read in your newspaper's local news section a report that our company received a warning letter from the Blood Vengeance Elimination Group, along with two bullets. We are deeply shocked and find this strange. Our company has never received such a letter, and we have long rejected hate goods. Since the facts are not correct, we are writing to request a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Tianfa Xie Electric Company, August 1</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shenbao:</p>
<p>Today (August 1), on page 15 of your newspaper, there is a news item entitled "Municipal Government Invites Reporters to Visit Seawater Bathing Beach." In it, it states that in my report on the expansion of the municipal ferry, there was a sentence: "Borrowed funds from foreigners to build the Donggou Wharf and the No. 1 and No. 2 new ferries." After investigation, the construction costs of the Pudong Donggou Wharf and the No. 1 and No. 2 ferries were fully covered by the ferry's operating surplus. The former was paid in full at one time, and the latter was allocated in installments, all of which were submitted to the municipal government for approval. The phrase "borrowed funds from foreigners" was not mentioned by me in my report. Your newspaper reporter may have misunderstood. I am writing to request a correction.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Tan Boying, Chief of the Fourth Section, Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, August 1</p>

<h3>Basic Principles of Railway Transportation Regulations</h3>
<p>(Continued) Zheng Baozhao</p>
<p>Those who only engage in the business of forwarding goods should not be considered common carriers. From a legal perspective, express delivery companies complete the actual transportation business through their agents and collect freight charges. As for the forwarder, they do not receive the benefit of freight charges and do not actually transport the goods. Based on this distinction, the former is a common carrier, while the latter is not.</p>
<p>Most legal scholars believe that sleeping car companies are not common carriers. They themselves do not transport passengers, but only provide passengers with sleeping facilities. Passengers purchase tickets from the railway, and the railway uses the sleeping car company's vehicles to actually transport passengers. Therefore, the railway must bear the responsibility of a common carrier. (X) Insurer's Responsibility and Baggage Transportation. According to ordinary rules, a common carrier has no obligation to transport goods using passenger cars. However, in practice, carriers often assume the obligation to transport passengers' baggage within a considerable stipulated weight. This business is not considered uncompensated because the fare is already included in the ticket price. Baggage transportation is part of freight transportation, so the legal restrictions it is subject to must also be within the scope of the carrier's obligation to transport baggage, assuming the responsibility of all insurers of common carriers and being liable for the loss of baggage. Therefore, what can be considered baggage transportation is a prerequisite for resolving baggage transportation liability. A detailed description is given below: (A) Items for personal convenience and need can be considered baggage transportation. All items related to the personal convenience and needs of passengers during the trip can be considered baggage transportation. If it exceeds the amount and value of this convenience and need, it cannot be considered baggage. (B) Items related to the passenger's occupation can also be considered baggage transportation. All items that passengers carry that are necessary for their occupation, such as the knives and saws carried by carpenters. If such items carried by passengers are lost, the carrier must bear the responsibility of an insurer. (C) Goods cannot be considered baggage transportation. Because in ordinary circumstances, carriers acknowledge that items for the convenience and needs of passengers can be transported as baggage, they can refuse to transport items beyond this scope as baggage. They can only be changed to freight transport or transported by passenger car with additional freight charges. Now, if a passenger submits a batch of items to the railway for baggage transportation, of which 90% are goods, and does not declare the nature of the contents to the railway, then the railway does not bear the responsibility of a common carrier. Because the railway is not subject to the legal restrictions of recognizing goods as baggage transportation after the contents of the goods are disclosed, if it is carried, there is no insurer's liability. (D) Goods of obvious nature. If the nature of the contents of the goods submitted by the passenger is extremely obvious and there is no concealment, if the carrier receives it as baggage transportation, then it must bear the responsibility of all insurers of common carriers. Because the goods have not been mixed up or disguised as baggage, the railway could have charged for it as freight transportation. Now that it has been negligent and transported it as baggage, it must be held liable for damages in the same way as freight transportation.</p>
<p>(XI) The question of whether the right of possession remains in the hands of the owner. The reasons why common carriers bear the responsibility of insurance have been described in detail above, because the carrier has absolute management and possession of the goods in transit, and the owner has no way of obtaining evidence of the carrier's errors. Therefore, if the carrier is not entrusted by the merchant to manage and keep the goods on their behalf, it is not liable as an insurer. Therefore, the right to keep and manage the items carried by passengers is in their own hands, so if there is a loss, the railway is not liable.</p>
<p>(III) The responsibility of common carriers to provide fair services and collect reasonable fares.</p>
<p>Now, let us try to explain the obligations and responsibilities of common carriers from the perspective of common law.</p>
<p>(1) Fair carriage of goods. Carriers must treat all merchants fairly and equally. This is also considered a matter of course in common law. If a carrier refuses the goods of Party A while unconditionally carrying the goods of Party B, it is considered an illegal act. Because this kind of behavior is enough to create a special position for one party, help it monopolize the formation of patents, and at the same time harm the business of its competitors. In other words, the railway must be responsible for transporting the goods of any merchant, and all carriage and delivery methods must not be different or discriminatory. This obligation is the inherent duty of the carrier and is also a necessary policy for public utilities. The reason why railways must treat the public fairly is that the government has given them various privileges, and this is precisely what is hoped for.</p>
<p>(2) Fair supply of vehicles. Carriers have an obligation to fairly distribute all equipment. If they go against this, it will inevitably lead to extremely serious differential treatment. Because if the supply of vehicles for a certain shipper is very fast, and the vehicles needed by its competitors are forced to wait, then the latter's favorable market will inevitably be lost, and its goods will rot or suffer other major damage. If the railway has promised to allocate a certain number of vehicles to a merchant's request, but is unable to supply the full number due to practical difficulties at that time, then the merchant may not protest. Only by notifying the railway with a rational attitude and asking it to make every effort to allocate the vehicles as soon as possible within the possible range, and without hindering the previous requests of other shippers at the same station and affecting the business of other sections of the line, can the request be made. Railways must treat shippers at all stations along the line equally. No station, in other words, no merchant, may force the railway to disregard the interests of other stations or merchants and provide itself with full convenience.</p>

<h3>"A Solution Exists"</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The words "a solution exists" are most welcome to my ears, because the worst thing in the world is not having a solution. If a solution exists, there is no problem. However, is the so-called "solution" just a verbal one or an actual one? I have had two impressions of the so-called "solution."</p>
<p>Previously, I saw that the business of a certain store was not going well and it was about to close down. As a result, creditors gathered to demand payment upon hearing the news. The store stated, "Please rest assured, everyone. We have a solution, and we will certainly satisfy your expectations in the shortest amount of time." But when the time came, it had already closed its doors and declared bankruptcy. The creditors wandered outside the door, without any recourse, and had to entrust a lawyer to recover the debt. This is one example of "a solution exists." I also saw several gentlemen on the road, flexing their muscles and glaring at each other with hatred. First, there was an argument, then violence. As a result, A won and B lost. B had no way to retaliate, and pointed at A, saying, "Be careful. I've suffered a loss at your hands today, but I definitely won't let you go. I have my own solution. Be careful." This is also an example of "a solution exists."</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw the results of the Pingzheng Committee meeting, which stated that "a solution exists" for the military situation in Rehe. I am suspicious.</p>

<h3>Words of Awakening</h3>
<p>— Songfu</p>
<p>Rumors abound, causing residents to flee in panic. There is no safe haven within the country now. Where is the peaceful and happy land?</p>
<p>Which is better, British or Chinese rule? Do not advocate for confusing people's minds. I advise the people not to disturb themselves and to be content with their fate.</p>
<p>Where do you want to go in this thorny land? It is too late to regret wasting money. Property is ultimately an external possession. Only your heart knows the gains and losses of survival and death.</p>
<p>Monsters arise from humans; there is no need to worry. Live in peace and do not worry unnecessarily. From now on, stop listening to rumors and do not let villains succeed in their schemes.</p>

<h3>Method of Making Alkali from Wood Ash</h3>
<p>— Er Cheng</p>
<p>Before the advent of soap, rural women used grass ash soaked in water to wash clothes, which certainly had the ability to remove dirt. However, its use was very inconvenient. Modern science has made great progress, and it has been found that the ability of grass ash to remove dirt is entirely due to the alkaline substances it contains, such as Potassium Carbonate (M2CO3), which are the main dirt-removing raw materials for industrial and household use, and are also the basic raw materials for making caustic potash. These alkalis can be extracted from wood ash. Now, I will record this method below, which is also a method of waste utilization.</p>
<p>Raw material - Rice straw forest ash</p>
<p>Method - If we want to make alkali, the first thing is to choose the raw material. Although all grass and wood ash contain potassium, the amount they contain is different. Generally, grass ash contains more potassium than wood ash, and bark ash contains more than trunk ash, so it is most appropriate to use grass ash to make alkali. However, it is more important to note that once the grass and wood are completely burned, the ash turns white, and the amount of potassium it contains is lost. Therefore, it is best to take rice straw ash that is not completely burned and has a black color. Once the choice of raw material is determined, it can be prepared for manufacturing.</p>
<p>First, take a wooden barrel with a hole in the side of the bottom, and plug it with a cork. Cover the bottom with two or three layers of thin cloth, then put the grass and wood ash into the barrel, and soak it in clean water for a day and night. At first, it must be gradually stirred, and then let it stand. Then, pull out the cork, and the liquid will flow out of the hole, and the residue will remain in the barrel, which can be used as fertilizer. Put the ash quality that flows out into a pot, and heat it over a low heat. When the water evaporates, you can add more ash juice. Evaporate it gradually, and the liquid in the pot gradually becomes thicker. Then, you can take out a small amount in a bowl and let it cool. If it can solidify, then remove the pot from the heat and let it cool. Then, you will see a yellow crude alkali forming. This yellow crude alkali is very impure. It is best to refine it. The method of refining is to dissolve the crude alkali in clean water, stir it slowly, and let it stand for a day or two. Take the clear liquid on top and cook it in the same way as before. Then, you will see a white, pure alkali precipitate.</p>

<h3>A Modern Woman I Know</h3>
<p>— Shao Guang</p>
<p>Among the several female friends I know, only Miss Wang has left the deepest impression on me. Indeed, she truly deserves to be called a thoroughly modernized contemporary woman. However, she likes to say in front of people, "I am a modern and artistic woman, a representative of the surging tide of modern times." Therefore, I can only refer to her as a modern and artistic (?) woman. She is a product of Shanghai. Because she is a product of Shanghai, she is thoroughly modern. As for art, standing on a truly non-artistic point of view, one can also call it complete.</p>
<p>So, how modern is Miss Wang? — Artistry is really out of the question. Yes, as long as you have met her once—unless you are talking nonsense—you will definitely be amazed. Her face is painted as vividly as a rose, charming. Her two crystal-clear eyeballs are agile and flow like clear dewdrops on flower stamens. Her water chestnut-like lips seem to have been cut with a knife, quivering with blood-red color. Her eyebrows are painted as vividly and enchantingly as willow leaves. Her erect breasts, lightly wrinkled soft waist, and black hair are permed into a magical sparrow's nest. On her jade-like fingers, she wears a diamond ring worth a thousand gold. A pair of five- or six-inch-long fleshy feet are stuffed into high-heeled leather shoes that make a "de-de-de" sound when she walks. Other accessories, such as pearl earrings, a gold watch, a gold bracelet, and a platinum necklace... she has everything. She lives in a Western-style building, wears imported goods with constantly updated designs, and eats delicacies from the sea. Her daily work, besides drawing eyebrows, applying powder, putting on lipstick, perming her hair, spraying perfume, and manicuring her nails, is to chat and joke with her lover in the park, or whisper sweet nothings in front of champagne, reveling in self-satisfaction, or embrace and dance in the ballroom, or passionately kiss and indulge in the movie theater, or point fingers and gossip in the amusement park, or drive around in a car on the main street, showing off her thoroughly modern spirit. And then there are playing poker, mahjong, and gambling with dominoes and mahjong tiles.</p>
<p>As for her purpose in reading, it is to facilitate writing love letters, reading sexual histories, and looking at cosmetic advertisements and movie descriptions. The English that constantly flows from her mouth is "I Love you My Darling, Kiss Dancing Goal..." I ask you, what about Miss Wang is worthy of being called artistic? Alas!</p>
<p>In fact, aren't those women in Shanghai who live a life of pleasure and consider themselves modern all like Miss Wang, utterly ruined and filthy? I don't know the depths of Shanghai women's love for vanity!</p>
<h3>[Amitabha]</h3>
<p>— Wen Yuan</p>
<p>"Ding, ding, ding..." The doorbell kept ringing.</p>
<p>"Who is it? Mr. Ni is not at home." The servant A Er saw the two monks standing outside the door and answered before they could speak.</p>
<p>Because the guests at Wang's mansion were mostly wealthy merchants or high-ranking officials, what about the servants? They were usually very polite. But today, this low-class servant A Er spoke so arrogantly, which naturally surprised some people inside.</p>
<p>"Go and take a look outside. Has a mistress come?" Mama Wang, who liked to talk, said as she walked out.</p>
<p>"We are not here to beg for alms, but to see your madam. We have just come from Mount Emei in Sichuan and have brought some things to offer to you," the two monks explained their intentions and pushed the door with their hands.</p>
<p>"So it's these two great masters. Oh, it's been a long time! A Er, you're blind! Hurry up and open the door!" Mama Wang recognized the people and scolded A Er while specially walking down the stone steps to greet them.</p>
<p>These two guests entered the magnificent living room, sat on the sofa, put down the things wrapped in their hands, and chatted with Mama Wang.</p>
<p>"Oh, I forgot to invite the madam down."</p>
<p>Mama Wang talked for a long time before remembering to go upstairs to invite the hostess.</p>
<p>After a lot of small talk about Buddha, temples, and Fengdu City in Sichuan, etc., the younger of the two monks opened his bag and took out a stack of things wrapped in oil paper from the sutras.</p>
<p>"Madam, this is top-quality Yunnan soil. You can't buy it in Shanghai even if you have money. It's cheap in Sichuan. This package has a little less than fifty taels," the young monk uncovered the oil paper and handed it to the hostess to see.</p>
<p>"Good, very good." Mama Wang brought down the handbag from under the pillow upstairs. Madam Wang unfolded the thick stack of things with her hands, sniffed it with her nose, and then used her hands to test the weight.</p>
<p>"Here is one hundred and fifty yuan. You have worked hard. Please bring it again next time," Madam Wang took the money from her handbag and paid the monks.</p>
<p>"Amitabha!" The two monks took the money, clasped their hands together, and bowed to the ordinary female benefactor.</p>
<p>"Amitabha!" A Er opened the door for the monks and muttered to himself.</p>

<h3>Memories After Waking Up</h3>
<p>— Dong Xin</p>
<p>There is one thing that gave me a very deep impression. Although the matter has passed, the situation of this event often appears in my mind, like scenes on a screen in a movie theater.</p>
<p>I remember one day last year, I was ordered by my father to buy something on Jing'an Temple Road. When I ran to the street, because it was raining, I jumped on a trolleybus on the Bund. When I stepped on the trolleybus, I couldn't help but mutter, "Brother Zhuo, I haven't seen you for a long time—" I was very happy at that time because I met a classmate I hadn't seen for a long time. Before I could finish my words, I felt surprised. Although he showed a happy expression on his face, his heart contained countless sorrows and pains.</p>
<p>I remember that he was in the same grade as me five years ago. Among the same grade, his age was considered the oldest. I also remember that he often wore very beautiful suits, his hair was combed very smoothly, and he applied a very thick layer of snow cream. He only attended classes two days a week, and the rest of the time he was out playing. Classmates all knew that he was the most romantic and richest person in the school. When he saw me at that time, he moved a little to make a seat for me. I felt that he was completely different from before, much thinner than before. He was only wearing a very old black cloth gown at that time, and I felt that his situation had undergone great changes. I asked him how he had been lately, he shook his head and sighed, and then began to say...</p>
<p>"Me? I think you know too. You see I am already different from before. I think you still remember. When I was your classmate before, how much the classmates envied me, thinking that my family had a large fortune. Ah, you definitely won't believe it when I say it, I really tell you, my mother used to work for people in the countryside." When he said this, his eyes couldn't help but turn red, and the tears in his eyes gradually swelled. I wanted to comfort him, but it was already too late. He sighed again and continued to say...</p>
<p>"But when I was in school, I often cheated the money my mother earned. Because I have no father and no siblings since I was young. So my mother often gave me money, and she did whatever I said. Therefore, she sent me to Shanghai to study, but I abandoned everything and didn't care at all, and went on the path of a prodigal son, violating the teachings of teachers and elders. Not to mention that I couldn't comfort my mother, but instead often wasted the money she earned with her blood and sweat, throwing it into the dark places. Ah, I am truly a great sinner, this really makes me regret and makes me sad.</p>
<p>But my mother passed away last year, and I feel pain in my life. Ah, how sinful I am!" After he finished speaking, tears kept flowing. In the end, I learned that he was working in a factory, with a monthly salary of only fifteen yuan. Jing'an Temple Road had arrived, so after I said goodbye to him, I couldn't help but shed a few tears of sympathy.</p>

<h3>A Melancholy Letter</h3>
<p>— Si Zhong</p>
<p>Before picking up the pen, it seems that there are thousands of feelings to express, but when I pick up the pen, ah... where do I start?</p>
<p>"Life, ah, is originally a fleeting moment! The body, ah, is originally a drop in the ocean!" Whenever I think of this, how can I not think of "seizing the moment for pleasure" and enjoying the happiness of this golden age! But "the future is vast and worries are like the sea"! I can't help but feel sorrow.</p>
<p>Friend! Although I have not yet stepped into the path of society, although the demon of bread has not yet made things difficult for me. But ah! Several things have already proven my fate and can already make me dread the "path of life"!</p>
<p>Before, I remember having such a happy dream:</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"In a garden full of beautiful flowers, plants, and trees... the willow branches gently swayed her soft, slender waist, the snow-white ginkgo, the intoxicating magnolia, and the honeysuckle hidden deep in the vines were all smiling nimbly... but I only love the newly opened rose, because she has blush-like cheeks, because she has a fragrance that can refresh the heart. With such beautiful scenery, embellished with the clear sky, the warm sunshine, and the warbling yellow oriole that seems to be showing off its charm to me, a scene of "Heavenly Paradise" is completed." I just wander there, I just enjoy myself there, I just indulge myself there... all the roads presented before me are only bright, and everything that enters my eyes is happy!</p>
<p>However, this enchanting fantasy is not long-lasting! The beautiful garden is now desolate... the charming yellow oriole has flown elsewhere to show off... the sky is no longer as clear and lovely as before, only gloomy and bleak.</p>
<p>Whenever I think of everything in the future, melancholy thoughts ripple in my heart again, and crystal-like teardrops are about to burst out. Because I have no ability to revive this desolate garden, no ability to eradicate the thorns on the road, and even less ability to pursue light and create happiness!</p>
<p>Friend! When you see this letter, I guess you must be coming to advise me, saying... "Don't be negative, strive hard!" But, my dear friend! This is not necessary for me. Because I already know that decadence, depression, sadness, and worry can all hurt my heart and body and erode my life... but a dried-up lake can no longer ripple beautifully... a dead heart can no longer burn wildly.</p>
<p>When I write this, my hand is a little trembling, my limbs are just a trace of weakness, my eyes are full of crystalline tears, and something seems to be blocking my throat. I just want to cry loudly. If someone is willing to shed a tear of sympathy for me now, then I am truly grateful!</p>
<p>Friend! Please watch! Not many days from now, there will definitely be even more unpleasant news for you!</p>
<p>This melancholy letter can represent the thinking of the general youth of today. The fundamental mistake is to think of seizing the moment for pleasure and enjoying the happiness of this golden age. May I ask the certain gentleman who wrote the letter, is now the time for pleasure? Is it a golden age? Please let the general youth think about it. - Editor's note</p>

<h3>A Strange Society</h3>
<p>— Lady Wuhuai</p>
<p>Since graduating from a certain school this year, driven by boredom and idleness, I have been thinking about finding something to do all day long. One day, I found an advertisement in the newspaper for a certain academic society hiring a clerk, and I resolutely decided to try it. But when reading the newspaper, I had a question, because since it is hiring a clerk, it should be based on elegant writing style, so why can't the works be seen, and only going to the interview counts? Later, because my curiosity was too strong, I went with a classmate.</p>
<p>This organization is located in an Apartment, and the office is only a small room. It lives on the top floor. When I knocked on the door, a young man came out to open the door and led me in. After writing my resume and salary, he said to me very gently, "Whether or not you are accepted, you will know in the next few days." At that time, I was very surprised and asked, "Sir, you have not seen my works, how can you judge your choice?"</p>
<p>He smiled and said, "Hiring a clerk does not necessarily require looking at the works. You only need to look at his face to know the keenness of this person's thoughts." I felt even stranger after hearing this, and secretly thought, can one's wisdom and knowledge be seen on the face? Then all the trials in society can be avoided, and a lot of trouble can be saved. The saying "clever face, stupid belly" should no longer exist, but he is an intellectual, maybe he won't lie.</p>
<p>I came out with my classmates in the midst of such full of doubts, and I still feel surprised until now. Alas, this is really a mysterious and strange society.</p>
