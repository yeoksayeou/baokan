<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c1">論松崗洋右又玄 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>松岡洋右其人自滬戰以後。乃聞名我國松岡出生於日本山口縣。其先爲長州食幕時代之豪族。今津屋之商業經營頗著信譽。蓋幕府征伐長州而後。其所積資金。悉作軍用。今津屋家運於是袞落。松岡兒時即備受窮困。後隨其伯父渡美求學。返日未久。乃挿身於外交界。曾以侯補領事資格。在上海服務。當時山本條太郎爲三井物産上海支店長。森恪則爲山本屬下職員松岡當時即與此二人訂交。其後松岡曾隨西原寺公望參加巴黎和會。而對日本政府之官僚主義。深致不滿。乃主張國家亦應自省及反省。遂兼曾情報部長。與高橋内閣時代之外長内田康哉不恊。内田則曲意優容。并不准其辭職。而任其暫不到差。山本（條）乃推薦其任南滿鐵路理事。乃與外務省絶緣而刻意於東北。四洮路洮昻路之敷設。松岡皆直接參與謀劃。其意固在乎剪斷中東路。使日本勢力。伸張至於北滿。（洮昻路雖屬我國資本經營但仍不能脱離日本經濟勢力之操縱。）於是準備逐步實現其滿蒙鐵道網之理想。擴張日本勢力即所以壓抑中國民族資本之發展也。迄至濱口組閣。松岡方被選爲衆議院議員。被數十年欲爲議員之志願乃得達到。而集中注意者。仍屬對華外交中之（滿蒙問題。）其於議院之發言。亦多在外交方面。</p>
<p>此次國聯特别大會將注力於討論調查團報告書。而報告書中之日本。又處於外交的孤立地位日閥在報告書發表之初。原有（乾坤一擲）雖退出國聯亦所不辭之意嗣鑑於世界情勢之緊迫。設日本果失去國際同情者。則强兵猛將。亦不能爲力。德意志之覆轍猶新。前途之困難必巨。是故　目猛進之日閥。甚欲在外交上開一新出路幣原芳澤諸人。洵爲日本外交界之惑星。足以應付今日日本當前困難之局面。然彼　多傾向於自由主。義主張國際協謝者。與現今日本軍閥之侵略主義根本不同。而表裏如一確能爲軍閥作前衛者。惟内田爲能。幾經審愼考慮之結果。乃决定以松岡爲日本出席國聯之首席代表焉。其主要意義如下。</p>
<p>㈠松岡出身長州。與軍閥具歷史的淵源。而其個人主張。尤與軍部相暗合。故對國聯此次大會。乃任之爲首席代表。一新其外交陣容。</p>
<p>㈡松岡旣久住上海。復曾深究東北。又在美國留學多年。爲日本現時有數之外交家。雖曾一度脱離外務省。但擘劃南滿侵略政策。實不多見。故内田引用之。軍部亦加信任。</p>
<p>㈢日本之於國聯因日閥肆意譏評。内田之强硬主張。在勢捨退出而外。殊不易善其後。而松岡當與李頓爵士晤面時。曾有（若干時日之後中日糾紛即當解决）之樂觀論調。於日本外交轉換策略之際。彼尤爲適當。</p>
<p>且也。松岡住東北甚久。於蘇聯對（滿洲）關係。亦甚明瞭。値此（互不侵犯條約）正將開始協商之際。日本所欲得者。（哈維洛斯克）之煤油。中東路之收買北洋漁業之獨占。西比利亞鐵藏森林之開發。其中任何一項如爲日本所得。皆足以作將來侵略西比利亞及對美之武器。而目前日本所給予者。則僅屬紙上空談之不侵犯條約。彼蘇聯外交當局。并非愚　。亦豈能束手閉目任日本之愚弄耶。而松岡自命爲理解蘇聯最深切之人。雖非日蘇間協商之正式代表。亦無妨便道一爲試探。對所謂（滿洲（傀儡）國）之眞意何如。交換日蘇間對東北之意見。以日本所謂自身之安全保障。而考慮日蘇問互不侵犯條約。設使蘇聯能容納日本要求。則其對東北經營至少可得短期問之安定。大陸政策之基礎。因而奠定。縱使對國聯外交蒙受些微打撃。亦所不惜。總之。日本外交方針之轉換特策略上之轉換耳。爲積極的大陸政策之實施。而暫時表示態度之緩和。非肯接受調查報告書。尤非眞欲與蘇聯接近也。我中國際此生死關頭。而此次之國聯特會。較之巴黎和會及華盛頓僵議。其性質尤爲重要。我國顔顧郭三代表。贓爲一時之選。但對英法美諸國間外交上一切準備。似尙未能如日本之週密。對蘇關係。尤不可輕視。此次會議中我國應爲主中之主。無論爲成功爲失敗。均當具最大决心。持周詳計劃。更須備武力以爲外交後盾。否則國人雖欲生而無生路。雖有生存權而爲人刦奪以去。吾人觀夫敵方選材任能於松岡之道經蘇聯極意經營我國人當急起直追。尤望政府之能及時奮發也。</p>

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>樂得厲害、而一般生活、反而愈見平凡、從美國輸出到東方以至於世界各地的影片、就足以代表這種平凡生活之一面、可是自從一九二九年以後、尤以今年爲最甚、｜饑餓日衆、退伍軍人羣集華盛頓的時候、那種困苦形狀、眞令人有不勝今昔之感、（號爲呌化子多的祖國、一般人都顯出營養不足的樣子）在美國該没有這種險象罷、究竟事實不然、特别是近一年來更覺着窮困得很、失業的人特别多、城市上到處都是滿坑滿谷的找工作的人、鄕間則有東西賣不出、即賣得出也賣不起價、如果照我們舊習慣眼光看、這眞是件奇事、堆山塞海的麥粉擺在那裏、却會有人餓死、滿倉滿庫的布疋擺在那裏、却會有很多人没有衣服穿、鋼鐵工業汽車工業等等、更是一蹶不振、空有莫大的設備、却没有法子開工、聯邦準備庫的現金、今年雖略爲流出、但仍不下四十萬美金、可是一般人還是窮苦不堪、資本主義化了的美國農村、幾乎要回到原始的農業時代去、</p>
<p>（胡佛市面）曾盛極一時、全國上下、都謳歌過他、崇拜過他、美國的總統、雖不能像東方的皇帝那樣威嚴、可是他一旦當還之後、就可以安安穏穏地執政四年、毫無阻滯的使他的政治抱負實現、胡佛氏當還之初、果然是婦隭欽仰、隠然有以（全國）勢力指導全世界之槪、然而經濟恐慌襲來之後、也就和德國相似、若大的金融資本、竟没有什麽抵杭能力、多才而縝密的胡佛總統、亦不得不焦頭爛額、想盡了種種救濟的方法、終於是没有效力、轉瞬之間、四年任期就快滿了、風雨　　的時期、還不曾過去、競還的時期又來、要煽動一九二九年那樣的市面、事實上恐怕不可能、不過總得聊盡人事、所以自從大總統候補人指定之後、各種股标、曾陡然上漲一倍有奇、但是究竟空氣作用是虚浮的、九月以後又向下跌落、民主黨方面、雖然大産業資本家不及共和黨多、而近年以來、確有取得多數投票人的趨勢、雖然美國歷史上總統多半都屬諸共和黨、而近來的民主黨、却巳兩次抬頭、我們試看最近的五位總統、威爾遜縣任過兩次、（一九一三｜一九二一年）是民主黨政權、此外哈定柯立芝胡佛三位、都是共和黨勝利、就大體上誘、凡是聯任的總可以當選的、何况這次與胡佛氏競選的羅斯福、其個人體格、都欠健全、（他曾經得過瘫病）、現在還没有十分好全、要起來與胡佛競爭、事實上自不免有很多困難、這是競選初期的傾向、</p>
<p>至於兩黨的政綱、我想國内的各報、必巳早有記載、用不着重述、而且牠們的政、綱、也十分平凡、不見得有什麽特出的地方、不過僅有兩點値得叙述的、第一是禁酒令頒佈以來、一般美國人大都涎埀三尺、希望即開禁令、所以共和黨雖主張禁酒、却也表示有修改禁酒法的傾向、民主黨則直接主張開放酒票、第二是恢復市面與救濟失業問題、共和黨仍舊堅持保護貿易政策、并且爲牠過去種種努力挽回頽　市面的工作而辯護、又説現在巳具成交、　市面已開始退却、而民主黨方面、則反對保護關税、反對以辛苦所得的金錢、向海外無理投資、同時更高倡給失業者工作、兩位站在競選潮頭的人物、到處演説、放送無線電等等、翻去覆來、都是這一類意思的話、究竟目前的壞市面、是否巳經始退却、財政關税能不能緩和當前的經濟恐慌、我們如果用冷靜的頭腦、細加思考、就知道這還是個問題</p>
<p>可是、美國各大報占篇幅最多、街談巷議、講得最起勁的事件、還是選舉問題、到底選舉的勝利者是胡佛呢、還是羅斯福、幾個月以前對遠東問題的豪興、現在巳經減低了到與零接近、雖然李頓報告書已經發表、國聯快要開會、軍縮間題也十分緊張、世界經濟會議籌備會、也快要開幕、這此都是世界當前的大問題、雖未見得就能求得具體而又能實行的答案、却至少是與國際前途有密切關聯的、然而遠在大西洋太平洋彼岸的合衆國、與牠們似乎都有點隔膜、至於胡佛和羅斯福兩位、究竟那一位是一九三三年到一九三七年的總統、在本埠（紐約）各大阖都試行過投票、總是羅氏獲勝的多、同時自一九二一年以來、共和黨連舉三總統、大衆對於胡佛氏、也不免有些倦意、關於祭酒關於救濟失業恢復市面等、都覺着共和黨是不十分適任的了、所以（胡佛市面）已成過去、未來的白宮主人、恐怕要不免於換人、到底結果何如、要在十一月十日之復、　能完全四白、（一九三二十月十二日於紐約）</p>

<p>優游足球隊取一致聯合防線、未嘗不可取也、上週與東華之戰、雖無鋒芒可言、然嚴守不懈、使東華前鋒不能從心所欲、結果僅於下半時中因衛兵受傷而慘敗、昨日與曁南對壘、復取此種防線、努力抵抗、曁南雖稱曉勇亦不能如願以償、上半時曁南以一球見長、結果亦屬三比零、優游雖敗、亦非可侮矣、</p>
<p>上半時　　鐘鳴三下、動令交鋒、優游逆風佈陣、先弱一籌、曁南縱横馳騁、優游衛兵應付不暇、守門生意興隆、送往迎來幾時片刻暇咎、救出險球、數以打計、混戰三十分鐘、曁南左　劉祖侃在底絲傳送一球、時曁南前鋒、均爲優　監視、前衛莊世鴻趕前𦔳陣建立一功、</p>

<p>簽訂正約　　中德合同、早經商妥、關於該廠所需一切機械器具、由德承售、惟我方得派專門委員前往檢視訂購之機器是否精良、並得由該專員以其售價、與英美各國出品詳爲比較、是否低廉、如認爲一切滿意後、始准其裝運來華、配置應用、至於技術人才、我方尙稱缺乏、故亦規由德國選派技師、應我聘請、僅作技術上之輔助、故將來中央鋼鐵爲我國政府得要之自辦企業也、合同之簽訂期、因廠址地點、猶未解决、故不能進行、但德方則巳多次催促、故本人願將地點、在月内解决、則下月初即可簽字矣、　　廠址未定　　設立鋼鐵廠之理想　　地點、當然爲兼有煤鐵鑛藏之區、蓋取其原料取給之利便、及生産費之低賤也、我國東北確有此種地區、若在南方、則有失天然分配之意義、蓋我國鐵礦、均在長江以南、而煤鑛則均分佈於大江以北、故煉鋼廠設立地點、乃頗費斟酌、有提議設於浦口者、該處水陸交通利便、將來可爲南北工商業之中樞、故純以經濟之眼光觀察、該處當甚相宜、且該處土地平坦、建設廠房、工易而時省、但如欲　及國防之重要意義、則此處必將落選、至於馬鞍山雖已作一度之勘察、但仍非十分安全之地、盖該山雖高、而鄰峯則甚矮小、軍政部爲此事、特派軍事顧問數人、乘飛機前往、再作一度空中之測視、始能定奪、故本人希望能在本月底以前、事、　　煤鐵原料　　鋼鐵廠所需之原料爲煤與鐵兩種原料、如能自給、則生産成本、可以减低、故中央鋼鐵廠、非僅設置鍊鋼廠而已、且將開採煤鐵兩鑛、該項原料、安徽省蘊藏甚富、現在所决定者、爲烈山之煤礦、及益華裕華兩鐵鑛、烈山煤礦·開採至千尺、可得煤二千五百萬噸故除供自用外、尙可價售、益華裕華兩鐵礦之純含量、爲百分之六十、可供二十年之繼續開採、故鋼鐵廠之原料甚富、惜資本有限、且係初創、不能計劃太大、故僅以八千萬爲設置經費、每日所獲之純鋼量、僅五百噸、供我國全部消費五分之之用將來如有贏餘、當按序擴充、大别山富藏之鐵、正可供繼續之開發耳、　　設置經費　　鋼鐵廠全部之資金暫定爲八千萬元、以一千萬元爲開採烈山煤礦之用、其餘七千萬元之七成、即四千九百萬元爲建置廠址機器之用、而其三成、即二千一百萬元、則供開採益華裕華兩鐵礦之用、此係約計、精密之計算、容後公布、</p>
<p>籌欵辦法　　上述八千萬之設備經費、在此國帑拮据、一時殊難籌措、故决定將其一半、即四千萬元、發行庫券、由中央銀行負責、作爲有價證券、而爲信用之確定起見、則由財政部指定全國税收之一部份、以爲担保、本人已舉宋部長談及、已蒙允諾、其餘四千萬元、則由實業部出面、以烈山之煤産保證借欵、烈山煤産、約計二千五百萬噸、以每噸十元計、則可値二萬五千萬、故此項担保、亦甚可銘、如是八千萬之巨欵、由財實兩部分担、旣易籌集、更輕担負也、</p>
<p>建造日期　　中德合同、如能如期簽訂、部中即派專門家赴德檢視機器、以便裝運來華、其往返時間、約須二月、故簽約後三月、第一批機器、即可到達、廠址如定在浦口、以平地建屋較易、故三月後、廠屋亦可有相當規模、如定在馬鞍山、因山坡塡築工大、恐多需時日耳、</p>
<p>商設紙廠　　記者談畢、辭出後、中華　局陸費伯鴻·商務印書館王雲五等、進謁陳部長、商談設立紙廠事、惟尙無具體决定、故未經公布、陳部長昨日事畢後、即搭乘夜車返京、</p>

<p>一五、所以爲使工部局賬目審查員得執行其職務起見、鄙人以爲、僅須使其得自由查閲工部局賬簿與册籍、一面并由局中之辦事規則明白規定、工部局各職員、應於需要之時、將該局所有簿册賬目、證明憑軍、以及關係之各種文件字據、产給審查員查核、</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>社會上的婚喪制度，今昔不同；婚的排塲漸漸有削繁就簡的趨辇勢；喪的排塲，非但没有比昔日减省，而且變本加厲，益發虚僞和侈靡了！所以各處的（盛娶視），漸見其少；各處的（盛出殯），借着死人大出其風頭，却是很多很多。</p>
<p>政體變革以後，件件般般都從貴族化而趨於平民化；惟有辦到喪事，又從平民化回復到貴族化。只須肯化錢，無論死的是阿猫阿狗，都可以用着達官貴人的排塲；路由牌，開路神，中西音樂，大小鑾駕，甚至城隍廟裏的儀仗，也可加入；博得兩旁觀衆讚一聲好塲面，便以爲榮耀的了不得。</p>
<p>單是（盛出殯），倒也罷了；無如那些以喪爲戲的人家，都在出殯以前，大派其特殊的訃聞；這些訃聞，越厚，越有體面。曾見有一位印刷所老閶死了，印的訃聞，足有兩寸的厚度，派訃聞的僱役，怨聲載道，怨這印刷所小老闆加厚了訃聞的頁嚴，本店貨色，當然不惜工本，却不想挑這訃聞的雇役，險些兒壓斷了脊梁。</p>
<p>訃聞裏面，充滿着疊牀架屋的像贊，鄕下阿木林死了，至少要請村長區長做像贊，城裏雜貨店老閶死了，至少要請實業部長商會會長做像贊。這些，還算是按照着自己的身分；更有荒謬的，僞造着要人的像贊，甚麽（功留民國）（仁心俠骨），文不對題的都刋載在上面；如最近一個包攬詞訟者死了老子，翻印着他人訃告上的像贊，把中央要人的姓名都在訃聞上大書特書，以致被官廳拿辦鬧出一塲求榮反辱的趣聞。</p>
<p>訃告本來是欺人的，（泣血稽類）（苫塊昏迷），已撒了漫天的大謊，還要加着種種文不對題的像贊，這便是欺中有欺，大謊而特謊了！唉！</p>
<h3 id="c170">繁榮上海的原動力 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 金不同</p>
<p>｜（娼）（賭）（鴉片）｜</p>
<p>上海如何會如此繁榮，這實是一個極有研究價値的問題。</p>
<p>有人説，上海因爲是長江鎖鑰，水陸交通，都很便利，商賈輻輳，所以會日就繁榮。有人説，上海開埠極早，外人來華，均在上海登陸，逐漸的五方雜處，所以就繁榮起來。有人説，上海是全國金融的中心，因了經濟勢力的推動，所以會如此繁榮。</p>
<p>這此，在表面上看，確是理由很充足。但是，在上海的社會上留心一看，造成上海這樣繁榮的原動力，却並不是這些。</p>
<p>造成上海這樣繁榮的原動力，第一是（娼）。因了（娼）的關係，飲食業，衣料業等等便一天一天的發達。從前公共租界禁娼，市面一落千丈。因了鶯燕南遷，於是法租界的市面，日漸繁盛。這是一個極有力的證明。</p>
<p>第二個原動力是（賭）。從上萬銀子輸贏的輪盤，一直到一個銅板勝負的花會，各種各式，應有盡有，賭輸的賣房賣地，甚至於賣妻賣子。小一些的，總免不了上典當。這一來，又不知直接間接的維持了上海多少人的生活。</p>
<p>第三個原動力是（鴉片）。直接的加惠於燕子窠老班，夥計，不必説了。間接的造成了上海的夜市，眞是其功非小。法租界全盛時代，八仙橋以東，燕子窠鱗闪櫛比，水菓店，吃食店的營業，可以熱鬧到天亮。這也就可見其勢力的偉大了。</p>
<p>華界的市面，爲甚麽老是做不盛，就因爲禁（娼）·禁（賭）·禁（鴉片）。租界的市面，爲甚麽這樣好，就因爲不禁（娼），不禁（賭），不禁（鴉片）。這是使上海繁榮的根本原因。聽説日本人在東北提倡（娼）·（賭）·（鴉片）·這倒是很有道理的。</p>

<p>— 恨</p>
<p>｜原來是騙術｜</p>
<p>這是一椿滑稽可笑又帶着科學化的騙術新聞，發生的地點是廣西，時間呢，不過是前兩個月吧。我敢保證；這不是憑空僑造出來的，因爲是一個剛從廣西來此的朋友告訴我。</p>
<p>迷信神權，是我們中國最可憐可鄙的一種劣根性。在號稱東南第一文明都市的上海｜尤其是代表上海的南京路上尙且有虹廟，有吳鑒光，何况是没有受過二十世紀文明洗禮的廣西内地。在那裏的居民當中，我們隨便問一個少年的鄕人；（現在國府主席是誰？）他會膛目不知所對，但若問他關聖帝君是什麽朝代的人和事蹟，他就如數家珍，應答如流。在那裏；每個村落都有許多的廟。（神；給我以幸福呵！）每逢隂曆初一十五，都可以在任何一個廟裏看見委很多善男信女在禱告。聰明的騙子，就因之而施其滑稽的騙術了。</p>
<p>（這不是眞神下隆了麽？某個廟裏有一個神像能夠憑空立在一個箱子的中央，不要繩子或别的東西繋着。）這個消息傳出後，各村落的鄕人就一齊來這所廟來拜禱。果然，所傳不錯，在一個週圍封密的木箱的一個小洞裏，看見一個神像虚縣在中央，的確，是没有東西繋着，廟祝（看廟者）説：（這個神因爲此地惡人很多，所以親自下降來查察，各人都要誠心禮敬它。）於是很多的香火錢，流入廟祝的袋子裏。</p>
<p>天下的秘密是不能永久暪得過人的，這怪事給當地政府知道了，就派人去騐看。西洋鏡拆穿了；原來這神像是鐵做的，箱子的週圍藏着同樣的磁質物，四週和上下的吸力相等，所以鐵的神像就被吸在當中，事情查明白了，於是這個科學的天神，就此壽終。</p>

<p>野蠻種族中，月經女，每被禁錮。非洲土人裏面，居月經婦人的所在，須揭紅族，以資標識。</p>
<p>月經血每次，大約自二英兩，四英兩，至八英兩不等。</p>
<p>世界各國，初次行經的婦人年紀，美國爲一四·一歲。最早爲法國，一二·六歲，最遲爲俄國和瑞士，爲十九歲。日本女人，最早的，爲九歲七個月，最遲爲二十一歲十個月。中國，平均十七歲。</p>
<p>月經平均二十八日來一次，最少二星期，最多爲六星期。</p>
<p>每次行經，大約最普通的，爲三日。其次四日至五日，五日，七日，和四日不等。</p>
<p>經絶期，中國舊説，爲七七四十九而天癸絶：但據塞尼司的統計，平均爲四七·一歲。</p>
<p>月經血内，除血外，復有粘液，破壞的細胞徽菌及粒狀的穢屑。</p>
<p>月經血的特點，是不易凝結：雖歷多時，依舊保持着固有的液質。</p>

<p>上週棉紗念轉直下、因海外棉市振、國内實需沉滯、皆受金融緊迫影響各帮絶無採辦能力、因之現紗生意頗形淸澹、目日商在長江方面、日紗有大量傾售、於是本紗受其打撃今庚四鄉年景雖豐、無奈農産品售價輕賤、鄉民生計依然竊蹩、故購買力仍薄弱因此一般投搗家努力抛賣、同時某廠商、對於人　　船採花等紗極願開　、而價格尙願遷就、故賣方皆有充量之曁碼、永安多頭雖仍在極力掙扎中、然環境太壞、潮流如斯、一時難以拘回市盤遂發現新低峯、嗣至週末、美花稍漲、引起獲利者扒空、市况微高、至於紗銷蜀中戰事未息、辦意未動、旧對於遠期貨時有買進、其他帮口生意頗淸查全週各帮買去統計七千二百七十九包、内中　貨佔多數、標紗多頭斬結、各月價比前週跌二兩一四錢、全週成交統計十二萬九千六百五十包茲將各帮口買去之額量分列於下、</p>

<p>戴高帽就是拍焉屁，喜歡戴高帽的人。，他偏偏肯認賬。，這原是一般普通的心理。，所謂（千穿萬穿，馬屁不穿），但是其中亦有分别，有的明知他人給我高帽。，而假裝不知。，有的自己戴了高帽。，還是莫名其妙。，眞是可燐。，</p>
<p>曹操眞是奸賊。，孫觀曾經送他一頂高帽戴他會曉得。漢獻帝二十四年，孫觀上書，稱臣於操，稱説天命，操以示外曰，是兒欲踞吾著爐火上耶。，時陳羣等幾位大臣。，大家送春風人情。，拚命奉送高帽子給曹操戴。，説道殿下功德巍巍。，宜正大位。，操曰，若天命在吾，吾其爲周文王矣，這領高帽子到底不肯戴上。，還是他的乖處。，</p>
<p>但是有的人，自己戴了高帽子。，還没有曉得。，眞是可笑。，蓮池大師語錄云，昔有一老宿言，舉世無有不好名者，因發長歎，坐中一人作而問曰，誠如尊諭。，不好名者。，惟公一人而巳。，老宿欣。然大悦。，不知一領高帽。，巳輕輕爲人戴。在頭上。，他自己還在得意。，可知有人送你高帽子戴。，欲完全拒却。，亦是很不容易的事。，</p>
<p>我的詩十分桂花，而且也做不來，連失粘出韵多不曉得，因爲高帽子三字。，相起曾經做過一首歪詩。，不論怎樣，姑且寫在下邊，以博讀者諸君一笑，上元節，友人以西帽見贈，并書曰，奉君高帽一頂。，以當新年恭喜發財吉語。，歌以戲之，</p>
<p>蒙君惠我高帽子，縇爛奪目無與比，間君此物自何來。，君以千金謀諸市。，此間高帽一何多。，强頑如君亦有此。，人間冠帶何翩翩。，結駟連騎競奢侈。，我乃粥繪屠狗徒。，沐猴而冠羞國土。，寄語世間勢利奴。，莫使張冠去帶李。，</p>

<h3 id="c196">製鹽時副産物之製法 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 系心</p>
<p>當食鹽製造時，無論用何種方法採取者，其時必有多量之苦滷産生，故爲製鹽時之副産物，其味苦，爲黄色油狀液比重爲一·二○｜一·二八·其成分除餘留之食鹽外，主要者爲鹽化鎂，硫酸鎂，其他尙有少量之鹽化物，硫酸鹽及漠碘化物等，故可利用之以製硫酸鎂及炭酸鎂，其方法如次！</p>
<p>㈠硫酸鎂之採製法因硫酸鎂在含有多量鹽化鎂之液中，不易溶解，故可利用此作用，將苦滷　冰箱中，成在冬季寒冷之時，硫酸鎂即結晶析出，爲半透明之結晶。</p>
<p>然後熱淸水于釜中，達七十度許，漸次投入不純之硫酸鎂結晶，攪柈溶解之，至母氏比重三十六度，即停止投入，即靜置之，沉垽其混有之污物，約經十時後，入沙濾中濾過之，其時溫度須保持在五六十度之間，以其濾液冷却之，溫度約在十度左右，則液面析出硫酸鎂結晶，倘所得之結晶不良時，則以噴露器，噴出露狀之水，使其表面稀薄，而由下層析出結晶，俟結晶完全，取出乾燥之，則得精製硫酸鎂，其餘留之殘液，因尙含少量硫酸鎂，可混入次回液内，繼續結晶，至三四回後，其殘液多含不純物，不妨葉之，通常一百斤之不純硫酸鎂，可得純粹者七十斤左右，其結晶爲棱狀或針之結晶，能溶於二倍量之水中，其溶液宜呈中性，加硝酸銀不生白色沉澱，加炭酸阿摩尼亞亦不生沉澱，通常即以上列之性質，以鑑識硫酸鎂之是否純潔，爲醫術上著名之瀉鹽Ｅpsomsalt，亦可用爲肥料，及染色術上亦用之，並可以之製肥皂。</p>
<p>屬地業己失盡太部仍在甜舞若不及早覺悟行將一網捉盡</p>
<p>㈡炭酸鎂之製法苦滷析出硫酸鎂結晶後，其餘液尙含多量之鹽化鎂，此種物質雖製成純品，亦無何種之價値，故現今皆用以製炭酸鎂。</p>
<p>製法即以析出硫酸鎂後之苦滷，用砂濾過之，以母氏比重汁測其比重，再溶解炭酸鈉於水，使其比重與苦滷相等，放置二小時，沉降其污物，然後徐徐注入苦滷中，攪　之，則化合而生炭酸鎂之沉垽，此時溫度宜保持在六十度内外，炭酸鎂溶液加入之量，若苦滷百分，則需炭酸鈉六十二三分，待完全加入後，放置一二小時，再加炭酸鈉液少許，若不繼續生沉澱即可濾過之，取其沉澱，入洗滌箱中，此箱爲長方形，深二尺六寸，長六尺，寛四尺之木槽，底部有一排水口，槽内置以二三寸厚之砂粒，上敷布片，炭酸鎂移入後，徐徐注入淸水，洗滌之，約二十小時，除去其硫酸鹽類及鹽化物等，然後用布包裏之，裝去其水分，乾燥之，即成純潔之碳酸鎂，大約苦滷一石五斗加炭酸鈉百八十磅，可得百斤之炭酸鎂，爲白色，無味無臭之疎鬆粉末，能完全溶解於五十倍稀之硝酸中，若加硝酸鎂及硝酸銀不生白澱，若以炭酸鎂一分加蒸溜水二十分，濾取其液，蒸發乾涸，不生多量沉澱，通常即以此幾種性質，以鑑定炭酸鎂品質之良否，可用以燒火磚，及堅硬之築料，故房屋之建築上多用之。</p>

<p>（兒童）在中國，向來是被漠視，大家都當作無關輕重的事。而在今日，則成爲一個嚴重性的問題了，許許多多的敎育家已把他們的視綫完全移注在這個方向，把他們的身體整個貢獻給這個事業！因爲兒童好像植物的幼芽，在這個時代，敎育不得法，就很容易會汨没了他們純潔的本性，摧毁丁幼稚的心靈，將來長成，壓根兒，無非是些不適合社會的殘廢的東西！</p>
<p>兒童是國家的根本，我們能夠死心踏地敎他們本性給汨没，讓他們心靈被摧毁而致國家於沉淪嗎？·······</p>
<p>爲了這些，我讀過一日（非非）先生的所謂（改良兒童）的大文，我讀了再讀，十分引動我的對於這個問題的興趣，我很想來説些不凑趣的話，好在我們的（非非）先生巳在他的大文之末，加上一條（編者先生以爲怎樣？本會同文和讀者以爲怎樣）？的尾巴，我就以小讀者的資格（實在不敢，也配不上説是非非）先生的同文），敬接受這個機會，説我想説的。</p>

<p>— 學表</p>
<p>（摩登女子）的名詞，在現代社會上，風行一世，但是自從我認識了這個名詞以來，我但發現了她們許多矛盾的地方，現在且聽我道來：</p>
<p>㈠我們看一般摩登的女子，她們的頭髮，長得和萬道烏蛇一般地，常常可以見到垂下肩來像路易十四一樣的長髮，有的中間分了一條靑白的路，向兩旁梳成兩條粗而短的辮子，有的燙得像剌蝟船的根根直竪，這或者可説是最時髦的了，但是和從前梳辮子和髻有什麽分别呢？剪髮的目的，是爲了時髦，衛生，省事，經濟時間和便利，可是現在改留長髮算時髦，所費的時間和以前留髮時差不多，這到底是什麽算盤？所以這是她們矛盾之一。</p>
<p>㈡再看一般摩登女子的衣服，就拿旗袍來講，從大袖子長旗袍變做大袖子短旗袍，又改做窄袖而長的，花樣百出，現在最時髦的旗袍，是袖子短到臂變以上，窄到緊貼在胳膊上，衣長呢？長得穿了高跟皮鞋還是拖着地，把一大截粉臂露出來惹人注意是歐化，像從前裙委地一般地，與中國的古風，亦不過五十步與百步吧了！所以這是她們矛盾之二。</p>
<p>㈢最後我們鑒賞她們的脚罷！高跟皮鞋是最歐化不過的了！摩登女子總少不了牠的，可是同樣的高跟皮鞋，外國女子穿着就大不相同了，她們有康健的步伐，我們中國女子穿了，都是蓮步輕移，有弱不禁風之感，跟從前的纒足有什麽分别呢？眞敎人盾了美在何處？這是她們矛盾之三。</p>
<p>以上説了一大堆，現在總抵的説一句，現代的摩登女子，我以爲除了美以外，應當注意便於行動和操作，因爲她們在高唱着女權解放，那麽她們不是應該用實力去爭麽？當然不能像從前的小姐奶奶們，風吹就要倒的了！更不能三奴四婢來扶持她，可是她們現在穿了葫蘆樣的旗袍，還加上一雙纒脚式的高跟皮鞋，不要説是工作，就是走路也左搖右擺的活像個不倒翁，所以我説她們不配做摩登女子，眞眞的摩登女子，那摩鄕下的姑娘纔夠得上資格呢。這般冒牌的摩登女子，我可老實不客氣的稱她們予盾女子了｜</p>

<p>— 康冰</p>
<p>新的克萊拉寳早巳忘記了巳往的克萊拉寳，並且她希望好萊塢也會忘記她，因爲一般人説她（歸來了）一Ｃomeback，但克萊拉她自稱這是她的（新生涯）的開始，並不是（歸來），更不是（重臨銀幕）。</p>
<p>這是一個新的開始，以前的放縱，祇不過供現在的克萊拉意會而已。她現在已完全變更了她的風度和觀念，新的克萊拉寳是已長成熟了的一個，她的孩氣巳消滅，她現在巳成一個端莊而有作爲的女演員了。</p>
<p>她現已另有一所新屋，她對人説：（從今後起，我將從這窗檽觀到好萊塢簇新的風氣。）她並非因此皮維來小山的舊屋不舘適，實在那裏給予了她許多不好的記憶和形象所致。</p>
<p>她現在巳是福克司公司的演員了，那福克司的裝飾師對於她的化裝室異常關心週到，他先去打聽了她以前在派拉蒙公司的裝室，是完全用黑色和金黄色配的，於是他們也照樣地用黑色和金黄色來粉刷她的新裝室，但這新的克萊拉聽見了他們的這計劃，她一方面很懇切地感謝裝飾師的誠意，但一方面要求須用綠和白的顔色。</p>
<p>她（新生涯）的目的，誠然是在賺錢，但在她决定攝ＣallＨerＳavage之前，她曾考慮過各公司所擬的劇本和她自己的角色，她終於接受了福克司公司的合同。（據説每攝製一片爲十二萬五千金圓）</p>

<p>— 吉仲</p>
<p>諸位，你們總不以爲電影是專爲娛樂的唯一工　　具嗎？無疑的它是負有提高人民智識發揚國家文化，改造社會，改良一切的重任，尤具是我們可以相信不論那一國的電影的趨勢同作風，都有關於整個國家的命脈，事實是强有力的證明，這裏可把較顯著的寫它出來。</p>
<p>㈠美國影片的趨勢，眞的他們總帶看顯耀華貴的表示，充分的現出歌舞昇平的氣象，在多金的情形之下，美國的電影始終脱不了糜費浪化的色彩，也就是理想的電影，美術化的電影，貴族化的電影，一面又專以男女之情，風月之私，來爲必需的描寫和穿挿，整個的美利堅，也盡在電影的縮影裏。</p>
<p>㈡日本的電影事業，的確幼稚得還及不上我國，可是他們在意識上，理智上，無疑的要比我們要高超得多，他們不攝飛劍鬥法一類的神怪影片，來麻醉整個的社會，同時他們還不拍淫蕩風流一類的愛情影片，來流毒靑年的男女，武士道就是他們攝片的標準，鼓勵戰爭的偉大，表揚好鬥的精神，殺，就是他們整個的出路，於是人民的意識同觀念，就充分的受了影片的迷惑，一百二十分不合公理的侵略中國東省，人民們却依舊高聲呐喊，願作後盾，雖然這裏面的原因是很複雜，可是給電影藝術所造成的，究亦佔了重要的一部。</p>
<p>（國難日亟，國事日非，）我們電影界總將負起些責任罷，那末我們應當定誓起來，今後永不再去攝淫盜荒靡，神妖風月的一類電影，我們需要的是現實而不理想，勤樸而不奢侈，積極的而不消極的，勇敢的而不衰廢的，同時是抵抗而不是不抵抗，好鬥與好殺的精神，更爲不可少的背境，牛一般的電影界，可以醒罷。</p>

<p>她的芳齡才十九歲哩她雖生在Ｋyote但是在美國長大的她是在美國唐人街發現的，因爲這時哥倫比亞公司正要找一位中國女明星，擔任ＴheＢitterＴeaＧeneralＹen一片中的角色，所以便給她訂了張臨時的合同，後來這片攝竣之後，又重訂了一張五年的合同。</p>
<p>她説這是很奇突的，因爲她巳是二年了没有找到一個職業，在這些時候没有人能注意到她，她以爲自己要失敗了，忽然給哥倫比亞看中了，她眞算幸運極了。</p>
<p>這位（中國女明星）的芳名，呌做ＴoshiＭori這不是活活一個與我們（同種同文）的一個名字麽？而她生長在Ｋyote是否即Ｋyoto？（日本京都）我們中國國勢這樣衰弱，難道還來冒我們的國藉麽？這却有些蹊蹺，編者附註</p>

<p>不過一般的影片，到今天爲止，在它底這種效能上，還没有擔負過這樣的任務。祗有蘇聯的影片，是常在敎育的實習方面非常流行。這種敎育的實習之採用影片，是足以助成那種（再度武裝）之需要並使之遂行的。像（帝國之一斷片）這種的影片，它僅恃利用着一種（演説的）影片之敎程，去積極研究一個性格代表之心理蔓延狀態，這影片是剌激了蘇聯電影，使之向一個比（製成傑作）還更其豐富的目的前進。</p>
<p>現在蘇聯影片，是能夠轉向革命前去找它的主題了。以前雖然也曾這樣做過，但那時多不過是一種一般的紀錄：而現在則是對於人類生活之各種細微處去作一種特殊紀載的描寫了。（旱地）一片，爲一九三○年中在一個動蕩不定的時機中之製作，那是正値蘇聯影片處於一個消歇雖然不至於無聞的時候，我們忽然見着史詩中之牧歌底遺蹟，在當時那樣的情形之下，這實在是趨於一種大而遠的冒險。導演者的雷斯曼，是並非致地，其在（在古西比利亞）一片中，是早巳顯示了他底能力而博得釆聲了。（未完）</p>

<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>一般的女星，在好萊塢她們的服裝，當然是很漂亮的，在她們之中，至少有一個女星每年爲了她的服裝，要費去五·○○○金鎊。</p>
<p>這位女星是麗蓮塔許門ＬilyanＴashman，她新近打從巴黎和紐約回到好萊塢，外衣内衣運動衣一共帶了十一箱，但這些衣了，都不是預備在銀幕上用的，祗是她因爲做愛德門夫人。在新婚之前做的新裝。她雖是服裝頂講究，但是她向人説：</p>
<p>（我在平時所穿的東西，比在銀幕上穿的，要簡單得多，做工衣料都没有在銀幕上的精緻。）</p>
<p>（普天下的女人，看見了我和别的女星在銀幕上穿的衣服，便爭相仿效，這是她們完全錯誤了。銀幕上的服裝，就在適於攝影，如果穿了這種衣服，在街市上行走，未免太是浮誇了。就是在家裏，也更不舒服。）</p>
<p>她又對人説，女人的衣服，要適合她的身段，假如她穿的衣服是過分的浮誇，那麽她的一舉一動，總要表露得年紀格外輕些，就是走路也應當快一些，假如她的女服，是非常的莊嚴，而拖曳在地上，那麽她的身體，應當挺直，在别人看來，更見是一個美麗的皇后了。</p>

<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>在這裏我不要標榜甚麽主義，也不打算引用一大堆半生不熟的新名詞來麻醉讀者，我祗覺得目前中國電影界所急需要的，就是新的表演人才，能夠獨創而不崇尙模倣。</p>
<p>造就新人才的重早巳有許多人見到的了，但是由誰來造就呢？怎麽樣的造就法呢？指望政府撥出公欵來創辦一個電影專門學校嗎？誰也不敢存這種妄想。如果指望影片公司來負此重任，那也是辦不到。因爲，造就人才並不是一椿生利的買賣。所以，即使有某一影片公司開辦傳習所或訓練班一類的東西，至多也不過是替影片公司節省雇用臨時演員的一宗開支而已。决没有一個影片公司肯耗費了許多敎練費爲他家影片公司造就人才的。</p>
<p>但是，在上海報紙的社會新聞欄裏，每年你總可以找出一兩條掛了電影學校那一類的招牌，實行詐欺取財的案件來。每一次被騙的學生多則數千，少則數百，你就可以知道，單以上海一市推測，希望做電影明星的人，確巳不在少數。全國統計起來，更不知道有多少了。在這許多人裏面，何嘗没有可造之材？可惜他們得不到正當的研究與練習的方法。我現在借這一點篇幅，介紹電影演員所必須有的各種智識和訓練自己的方法，給這許多不得其門而入的同好者。</p>

<h3 id="e1">On Matsuoka Yosuke's Profundity <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Matsuoka Yosuke became famous in our country after the Shanghai War. Matsuoka was born in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. His ancestors were powerful clansmen during the Edo period in Choshu. The business operations of the Imazuya family were quite reputable. After the shogunate's conquest of Choshu, all the accumulated funds were used for military purposes, and the Imazuya family fortune declined. Matsuoka experienced great poverty in his childhood. Later, he followed his uncle to America for studies. Not long after returning to Japan, he entered the diplomatic world. He once served in Shanghai with the qualification of a consular candidate. At that time, Yamamoto Jotaro was the Shanghai branch manager of Mitsui &amp; Co., and Mori Kaku was an employee under Yamamoto. Matsuoka became acquainted with these two at that time. Later, Matsuoka followed Prince Saionji to the Paris Peace Conference and deeply dissatisfied with the bureaucratic nature of the Japanese government, he advocated that the nation should also introspect and reflect. He also served as the director of the intelligence department and was incompatible with Foreign Minister Uchida Kosai during the Takahashi Cabinet. Uchida tactfully tolerated him and did not approve his resignation, but allowed him to temporarily not report to duty. Yamamoto (Jotaro) then recommended him to be a director of the South Manchuria Railway, thus severing ties with the Foreign Ministry and focusing on the Northeast. Matsuoka directly participated in the planning of the construction of the Siping-Taonan Railway and the Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway. His intention was to cut off the Chinese Eastern Railway and extend Japan's influence to North Manchuria. (Although the Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway was operated with Chinese capital, it could not escape the manipulation of Japanese economic power.) He then prepared to gradually realize his ideal of a Manchurian-Mongolian railway network. Expanding Japanese power was intended to suppress the development of Chinese national capital. It was not until the Hamaguchi cabinet was formed that Matsuoka was elected as a member of the House of Representatives. His decades-long aspiration to become a member was finally achieved. However, his focus remained on (the Manchurian-Mongolian problem) in diplomacy with China. His speeches in the Diet were also mostly on diplomatic matters.</p>
<p>The upcoming League of Nations special assembly will focus on discussing the report of the investigation team. Japan in the report is in a diplomatically isolated position. At the beginning of the report's publication, the Japanese financial clique originally had the intention of (staking everything), and was willing to withdraw from the League of Nations. However, in view of the urgency of the world situation, if Japan were to lose international sympathy, then even strong soldiers and fierce generals would be powerless. The example of Germany's collapse was still fresh, and the future would be extremely difficult. Therefore, the headlong-advancing Japanese financial clique was eager to open up a new path in diplomacy. Shidehara Kijuro and Yoshizawa Kenkichi were like wandering stars in the Japanese diplomatic world, capable of dealing with the difficult situation currently facing Japan. However, they mostly inclined towards liberalism, advocating international cooperation, which was fundamentally different from the current Japanese military clique's invasionist ideology. The only one who could serve as the vanguard for the military clique with consistency was Uchida. After careful consideration, it was decided to appoint Matsuoka as Japan's chief representative to the League of Nations. Its main significance is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Matsuoka was born in Choshu and has historical ties with the military clique. Moreover, his personal views coincide with those of the military. Therefore, he was appointed as the chief representative to the League of Nations assembly to refresh its diplomatic lineup.</p>
<p>(2) Matsuoka has lived in Shanghai for a long time, has deeply studied the Northeast, and has studied in the United States for many years. He is one of the few diplomats in Japan today. Although he once left the Foreign Ministry, his planning of the South Manchuria invasion policy is rarely seen. Therefore, Uchida appointed him, and the military also trusts him.</p>
<p>(3) Because of the Japanese financial clique's unrestrained criticism of the League of Nations and Uchida's tough stance, it is difficult to improve the situation other than withdrawing from the League. However, when Matsuoka met with Lord Lytton, he had an optimistic tone, saying that (the Sino-Japanese dispute should be resolved after some time). He is especially suitable at a time when Japan is changing its diplomatic strategy.</p>
<p>Moreover, Matsuoka has lived in the Northeast for a long time and is very clear about the Soviet Union's relationship with (Manchuria). At a time when (a non-aggression treaty) is about to begin negotiations, what Japan wants is (Khabarovsk's) oil, the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the monopoly of North Pacific fishing, and the development of Siberia's timber resources. If Japan obtains any of these, it will be enough to use as weapons for future invasions of Siberia and against the United States. However, what Japan is currently offering is merely a non-aggression treaty, which is just empty talk on paper. The Soviet diplomatic authorities are not fools. How can they stand idly by and let Japan fool them? Matsuoka claims to be the person who understands the Soviet Union most deeply. Although he is not the official representative for negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union, he can still conveniently make a probe. He can exchange opinions between Japan and the Soviet Union on the so-called (Manchurian (puppet) state) and on Japan's so-called security guarantees, to consider a non-aggression treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union can accommodate Japan's demands, then the management of the Northeast can at least gain short-term stability, and the foundation of the continental policy can be laid. Even if it suffers some blows in diplomacy with the League of Nations, it will not hesitate. In short, the conversion of Japan's diplomatic policy is only a strategic conversion. To implement an aggressive continental policy, it is temporarily expressing a softened attitude. It is neither willing to accept the investigation report nor truly wants to get closer to the Soviet Union. Our China is at a critical juncture of life and death, and this special assembly of the League of Nations is even more important in nature than the Paris Peace Conference and the Washington Conference. Our representatives Yan Huiqing, Gu Weijun, and Guo Taiqi are indeed the best choices, but their preparations in diplomacy with countries like England, France, and the United States do not seem as thorough as Japan's. Relations with the Soviet Union must not be underestimated. In this conference, our country should be the master of the masters. Whether it is success or failure, we must have the greatest determination and a comprehensive plan. Furthermore, we must have military strength as a diplomatic backup. Otherwise, even if the people of our country want to live, there will be no way to live. Even if they have the right to survive, it will be taken away by others. When we see the enemy selecting talents and employing them to the extreme, and Japan carefully managing the road to the Soviet Union, our people should quickly catch up. We especially hope that the government can rise up and take action in time.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Japanese Army Surrounded in Chaoyang Temple <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Transportation News: Shi Dianyu's Volunteer Army, with 700 men, and Sun Quandong's force, with 500 men, suddenly surrounded and attacked Chaoyang Temple on the morning of the 1st.

<p>Beiping: On the 13th of last month, the Japanese army dispatched the 4th Regiment and the 1st Brigade of puppet troops from Jinzhou to Yicheng and then advanced to the Chaoyang Temple-Beipiao area, attempting to invade Rehe and occupy Zhuangcun and other places. Many villagers were killed. Meng Zhaoyan urgently mobilized infantry and cavalry regiments, combined with Wang Yuanping's and Ma Li's local militia forces, totaling more than 10,000 men, and, under the command of Song Ruixuan and Sun Tianyi, ambushed them day and night. The enemy army was repulsed, 100 puppet troops surrendered, and 11 Japanese soldiers were captured. They pursued to the edge of Yixian before stopping. They then launched a fierce attack on Chaoyang Temple and Yicheng with all their might. After three days and nights of bloody fighting, they once recovered them. Later, after 1,000 enemy troops and a large number of puppet troops, nine tanks, and many aircraft launched a fierce attack on our troops, our army, fearing being surrounded on the 22nd, still defended Chaoyang Temple. After discovering that the enemy's main force was concentrated in Jinzhou and the plan to invade Rehe was still active, they devised a way to contain the Japanese army's road. So Song commanded Zhao Jinhua's and Li Shijun's troops, who had long harassed Jinzhou, to assemble 200 brave soldiers at Shenjiatai and attack the north gate of Jin County on the 25th night.

<h3 id="e8">Retreat of Tang Juwu's Troops <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Beiping: Sun Weixian, a military officer from the Sixth Route Army Headquarters of the Liaoning People's Self-Defense Army under the command of Li Chunrun, arrived in Beiping from Xinbin to describe the retreat of Tang Juwu's troops and the operations of Li Chunrun's troops. He said that the Japanese army dispatched more than 10,000 men from Shenyang on the 14th of this month, 5,000 men from Changchun, 15,000 men from Linjiang, and 4,000 men from Andong, plus more than 20,000 men from the puppet army and Ding Ni Zhishan's troops, totaling more than 50,000 to 60,000 men, and attacked Tang's troops in seven routes. The first route advanced from the southern mouth of the Shenyang-Haining Road northwest of Xinbin to attack Xinbin County. The second route advanced from Nanwandianzi in Qingyuan County to attack Xinbin County. The third route advanced from Shanchengzi to attack Tonghua. The fourth route advanced from Liuhe to attack Tonghua. The fifth route advanced from Badaojiang in Linjiang to attack Tonghua. The sixth route advanced from Donghejianzi in Huanren to attack Huanren. The seventh route advanced from Kanrenziguo in southern Huanren to attack Huanren. After Tang Juwu obtained accurate information about the Japanese army's attack, he had Li Chunrun lead more than 500 troops to defend the old city area west of Xinbin. With 500 troops lacking clothing and ammunition, they faced 2,000 elite bandits. In the end, due to the disparity in numbers, they were forced to retreat. They encountered the enemy again near Xuancheng early on the 15th. At this time, the enemy forces joined together and launched a pincer attack, making the situation even more severe. Li had no choice but to retreat to Erhulai, Huanren County. On the evening of the 16th, they encountered the Japanese army again at Erhulaiwanpu. Li then led his troops to retreat to Pingdingshan. Tang separately used Jiang's commando team and Jia's Fourth Team to jointly defend the rebel army coming from Nankouqian, Zhang's guard division to defend the rebel army coming from Wandianzi, Tang Zhenyu's troops to defend the rebel army coming from Kanzichuanzigou, and the remaining troops to defend the rebel army coming from places like Hejianzi. When the Japanese army fought with our army, they first had aircraft circle the front and drop hundreds of pounds of bombs. Then they used heavy artillery to bombard, destroying both mountains and villages. The Japanese army thoroughly searched the villages and travelers they encountered, and those with fairer skin and newer clothes were brutally killed. The general populace, seeing the brutality and ferocity of the Japanese army, were in constant fear for their lives. Therefore, they would rather live and die with the Volunteer Army and hoped for the arrival of the National Army as much as they hoped for rain in a great drought. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Fierce Battle Occurs in Luzhou <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui telegraphs Jiang and Chen with his opinions.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun's intention to enter Sichuan becomes more active.</p>
<p>Nanjing: Chongqing telegraphs that the Sichuan United Army launched a fierce attack on Luzhou on the 4th. The two sides engaged in fierce fighting. The United Army's strength is still continuing to cross the river. An airfield is being built in Rongxingchang. The United Army will launch a general offensive ten days ago. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Hankou: On the 6th, Zhang Qun convened a meeting at Bao Wenwei's mansion with Qiu Jia, representative of Liu Xiang, Wu Hang, representative of Liu Wenhui, Cao Chang, representative of Deng Xihou, Yang Jintang, representative of Tian Songyao, and Huang Yawei, representative of Liu Cunhou, to hold talks. It was decided that each representative would telegraph their respective generals, requesting a ceasefire before the 21st to avoid international ridicule. After Zhang was urged by the representatives, he agreed to return to Sichuan. It may be agreed after meeting with Jiang. All representatives will accompany him. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou: Liu Wenhui telegraphed Jiang, saying that in the past ten days, he had ceded Shunqing once, Suining twice, Jiangjin and Yongchuan three times, and Dazhu, Anyue, Lezhi, and Hejiang counties four times. The generals and soldiers are indignant and willing to sacrifice themselves. However, Liu Xiang is still supervising his troops, actively launching fierce attacks. Wenhui believes that governing Sichuan should be based on laws and regulations to promote the realization of civil governance. First, the military and political power of Sichuan Province should be returned to the central government for disposal, eliminating the root of the disaster for twenty years. Second, the reorganization plan has already been promulgated by the central government, and all should comply with it, implement the reorganization, and be reorganized directly under the central government, eliminating the nature of local private ownership. Third, regarding the chairman of the provincial government, there is also a resolution to follow by the central government. In the future, the central government should issue an order to reorganize the provincial government. Once these three things are determined, the bad habit of defense zones can be permanently eradicated. Whether it is Chengdu, Chongqing, Wanxian, or Kui Prefecture, they can all be garrisoned by troops directly under the central government and cannot be divided up as before. Furthermore, three committees - military, political, and construction - should be specially formed outside the provincial government to impartially study and implement them in sequence. He requests that you take this opportunity to make a decisive decision, stop Liu Xiang's westward advance, and quickly send senior officials to Sichuan, so that the flames of war can be stopped, the Sichuan disaster can be permanently alleviated, and your grand plan to stabilize the southwest and secure the country can be achieved. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou: Tian Songyao telegraphed from Hankou on the 5th, saying that Liu Xiang's central route army has reached the Neijiang border and is about to be captured. The Chongqing army is attacking Luzhou in three routes. Once Luzhou is captured, the Sichuan war can be resolved. Tian's representative, Yang Jintang, said that on the 5th, he met with Zhang Qun and requested to return to Sichuan. Zhang's intention seems active and will decide his course of action in Hankou. As for the solution to the Sichuan affair, the methods of governing Sichuan for seventeen years, the ten legal measures proposed by the Shanghai Central Committee, and those to be formulated by the Central Political Council in the future are all feared to be incompatible with the situation in Sichuan. He has asked Zhang to propose alternative measures, which will be implemented after Jiang agrees. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: A member of the Central Committee asked the Executive Yuan to approve the establishment of an expanded committee to transform the Sichuan situation to determine ways to resolve the Sichuan affair. In addition to the members appointed by the central government, the remaining Sichuan army representatives in Beijing, important military and political figures from Sichuan Province in Beijing, and fellow villagers in Beijing will all participate to summarize the opinions of the central government, local authorities, and the parties involved in the war, and formulate a powerful and complete plan to be promulgated for implementation. (6th Dispatch)</p>

Political aspect: implement administrative unification, abolish excessive taxes and levies, and improve education in Sichuan Province. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Jinan, Xiong Bin says that upon arriving in Jinan, he telegraphed Liu Zhennian, but both wired and wireless communications are not working. This morning, he dispatched Secretary Lu, carrying a letter, to Ye County to meet Liu. The gist of the letter is that the Third Route Army should comply with the order to withdraw its troops, and he should also comply with the order to transfer his troops. Both are national troops, prepared to work hard for the country. When withdrawing, do not harm the local area. If there are difficulties, they can be explained, and a solution will be found. After the Third Route Army withdraws, the provincial government administrative officials must protect the administrative officials he appointed, and they must not be taken away when leaving, so as to avoid a situation where no one is responsible for local affairs in the interim. We are responsible for protecting their safety. Liu's troops have decided to be transferred to Anlu and Sui County in central Hubei. The military headquarters has been notified by telegram. An official order will be issued after the Third Route Army withdraws. Although he has not yet expressed any views on the defense area, he had previously expressed in general terms that he would obey the orders of the central government. At this point, it seems that there can be no further changes. I will go to Ye County after the Third Route Army withdraws. The navy must wait for the surveillance personnel dispatched by Zhang Jueliang, and cannot take over the defense on the 7th. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>Jinan, reporter asks Han about reports that Feng is united with Wu, Zhang, and Han to support Duan's restoration. Han laughs and replies, "This matter can be described as extremely absurd.

If Mr. Feng has the time, he should issue a public telegram to refute the rumors. Whether or not I have this idea, even Feng and Duan are those who eliminated the remnants of the imperial system and overthrew the restoration. They could not possibly do this." (6th dispatch)</p>

<p>Neither Side Wishes to Take the Initiative on Treaty Issues</p>
<p>Japan Claims to Have Established a Foundation for Future Formal Negotiations</p>
<p>Matsuoka Scheduled to Depart Moscow Tonight</p>
<p>Will Make a Brief Stop in Warsaw to Meet with Polish Authorities</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 5th: Following the second meeting between Matsuoka, the Japanese representative to the League of Nations, and Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Carahan today, reliable sources report that neither Japan nor Russia seems willing to take the initiative regarding a non-aggression treaty. Yosuke Matsuoka is striving to position Japan as being in favor of a non-aggression treaty, rather than advocating for it. Carahan, on the other hand, seeks to have Russia appear to be invited to join a non-aggression treaty, rather than proposing it himself. It is said that Matsuoka mentioned to Carahan the obstacles to concluding a non-aggression treaty soon, such as the strong opposition within Japan and the intense political infighting. He also stated that Japan is seeking to establish "Japan's true spirit" domestically, to address all issues with unity. Once this is achieved, a non-aggression treaty concerning "Manchukuo" will be easier to pursue. Carahan's attitude, it is said, has been sympathetic to a non-aggression treaty from the outset. He told Matsuoka that if a non-aggression treaty is truly beneficial to Japan, it should not be swayed by purely domestic political events. He also stated that the Soviet Union has always shown a friendly attitude towards "Manchukuo," and therefore remained neutral during General Ma Zhanshan's battles. According to unconfirmed reports, Carahan and Matsuoka will meet again tomorrow, but so far, neither side has made any concrete proposals. They are merely exchanging opinions, dispelling misunderstandings and suspicions, so that future diplomatic representatives of the puppet organization can easily make a formal proposal to both Russia and Japan to conclude such a treaty. It is also said that after discussing the possibility of a non-aggression treaty, they further discussed, in strict secrecy, the position Japan will take in Geneva, with the conversation lasting about an hour. Matsuoka will now postpone his departure from Moscow until Monday evening to attend the 15th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. According to Matsuoka's staff, he will make a brief stop in Warsaw en route to visit Polish dignitaries, but will not discuss diplomatic issues. He also plans to stay in Paris for two or three days before going to Geneva.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 5th: It is claimed tonight that Carahan and Yosuke Matsuoka will again discuss issues related to the puppet organization, as both sides feel that although these issues have not yet reached a concrete conclusion, mutual understanding has increased significantly.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Moscow, 5th: After the second meeting between Matsuoka and Carahan today, Matsuoka's representative told reporters that the meeting with Carahan aimed to guide Japanese-Russian relations towards general goodwill. This free conversation has now concluded, and although it was purely a personal meeting, it can be considered a gain on the way to Geneva.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Moscow, 5th: Matsuoka's representative's staff, including Secretary Kiichi Nakashio and nine others, departed from the Russian capital at 10:00 PM on the 5th as the advance team, heading directly to Paris to deliver a draft of Matsuoka's representative's opinion to Representative Nagaoka and other representatives stationed in Europe.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Police Department Uncovers Reactionary Organization <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Tenko-kai and the Seinen-sha Have Close Ties</p>
<p>Plotting to Launch a Riot During the Grand Military Exercise to Overthrow the Government</p>
<p>Leader of the Seinen-sha on the Run, Treasonous Documents Discovered</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The Metropolitan Police Department, with lightning speed, carried out a major crackdown on right-wing groups. The lead came from the confession of the head of the Murasakiyama Juku, who was arrested in connection with the May 15th Incident. During interrogation, he stated, "All confessions must wait until after the 10th. After the 10th, things can be revealed." His tone suggested that there were major conspiracies surrounding him. Around the 20th of last month, an explosion, like fireworks, occurred on the upper floor of the Independent Seinen-sha, a right-wing organization. Internal investigation revealed that the Seinen-sha had close ties with the Tenko-kai, led by Hidesan Toyama, the Murasakiyama Juku head's mentor.</p>
<p>Further internal investigation revealed that the Independent Seinen-sha and the Tenko-kai were planning to assassinate high-ranking officials during the Grand Military Exercise while they were in the provinces, simultaneously attacking power plants, to overthrow the government in one fell swoop. The Independent Seinen-sha was founded by Yoshio Kodama (30 years old) after leaving the Kenkoku-kai. During the search of the organization's headquarters yesterday, bombs, pistols, Japanese swords, and a treasonous document signed by Toshio Okada (who has already been arrested) were discovered. The document strongly advocated for the expulsion of established political parties, financial cliques, and "treacherous ministers," implying direct action. Furthermore, their core members seemed to have participated in the May 15th attack on power plants. Hidesan Toyama, the leader of the Tenko-kai, also has important connections with blood oath assassination groups. The reason why such figures as Nissei Inoue were able to avoid the Metropolitan Police Department's intensive search and arrest was because they were hiding in the Tenko-kai headquarters. Kodama, the leader of the Seinen-sha, has now fled and is missing. A rigorous search is currently underway.</p>
<p>Nihon Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The reasons for the Metropolitan Police Department's crackdown on Hidesan Toyama, the third son of right-wing leader Mitsuru Toyama, are as follows: (1) He supplied six pistols to the influential figure Zizan Juku, head of Murasakiyama in the May 15th case. (2) He extorted 200 yen in cash from Kichigoro Akanuma and Sadami Yamamoto, the perpetrators of the Tokyo Gas Company incident, who were arrested in September. (3) He played an important role in a plot to assassinate a certain high-ranking official. The Metropolitan Police Department is scheduled to escort Toyama to the Ichigaya Prison on the 7th. Nakagawa, Yamamoto, Yoshioka, and others who were arrested at the same time as Toyama are not directly related to the May 15th Incident, but are perpetrators of the gas extortion incident.</p>

<p>Advocates for the Use of International Conventions</p>
<p>to Resolve the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>Will Not Protect Aggressor Nations</p>
<p>Due to Commercial Interests</p>
<p>International Telegraph Agency, Paris, 6th: The French Radical Party held its national party congress in Toulouse. During the meeting, Representative Cote gave a speech mentioning French foreign policy, stating that since the party (referring to the Radical Party) now holds the reins of power in France, it must advocate for the resolution of the Sino-Japanese issue according to the plan suggested by the League of Nations report. France's policy should never protect aggressor nations due to commercial interests, but should support the invaded nation. Herriot also stated in this regard that France's stance on the Sino-Japanese issue is to advocate for its resolution in accordance with justice and various conventions. This expression by the French, as well as the declaration made by the French representative Bérenger in Geneva yesterday, stating that the French advocate for the resolution of the Sino-Japanese issue using the Nine-Power Treaty, etc., and do not recognize the validity of any nation obtaining territory of another nation by force, all demonstrate the attitude of the French representatives at future League of Nations meetings regarding the Sino-Japanese issue.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency, Toulouse, 5th: The Radical Party congress discussed foreign policy this afternoon, with a very crowded attendance. The chairman declared to the entire audience that Spanish Representative Garces was present, and the entire audience stood and applauded their welcome. Then Representative Detton, who was sent to the League of Nations as the French representative, rose to speak, saying that in order for the international situation to move towards détente, Franco-German rapprochement is essential. He also said that the current urgent task is not to compete in increasing armaments, but to achieve universal disarmament. To achieve this goal, the only way is to implement the arms reduction plan proposed by the French government. Garces said, "The ideal declared by the French Revolution is universal brotherhood. Even with the troubles of neighboring countries, it can still uphold this principle. This is what people know today." Representative Cote then rose to speak, saying that universal disarmament is a condition for the security of all nations, and that the French plan will surely enable the disarmament conference to be successful. The congress then passed a motion stating, in essence, that the Radical Party requests the government to implement its foreign policy in accordance with the spirit of the League of Nations, strive for the cooperation of all nations, and expresses its confidence in the government to work towards the success of disarmament, so as to ease the feelings of all nations and guarantee equality in the security of all nations.</p>

<p>Havas, Toulouse, 5th: Prime Minister Herriot revisited the Radical Party Congress and issued a declaration, the last part of which is briefly recorded as follows: Prime Minister Herriot confirmed the matter of France and the Soviet Union negotiating a mutual non-aggression treaty, but said, "The existing agreements will not be changed as a result. There is no doubt that the reason Britain participated in the European War was because it had signed a treaty guaranteeing Belgium's neutrality. If all the signatures on all treaties have the same value as Britain's signature, then peace can be regarded as fully guaranteed." Herriot also deeply admired Foreign Minister Bérenger's support for Briand's advocacy of peace. Regarding the issue of equality in armaments, Herriot said that if such a method contains the intention of restoring armaments, it cannot be recognized under any circumstances. If its intention is to consolidate public security, then France is prepared to accept it. Finally, Herriot also analyzed and explained the arms plan proposed by France.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Warsaw, 5th: Several ships of the Soviet Russian Baltic Fleet suddenly appeared near the Polish naval port of Gdynia in the Bay of Danzig, and it is said that Soviet Russian Minister of Military Affairs Voroshilov was also on the Marat flagship. As a result, Polish public opinion has become greatly alarmed and demands that the government urgently lodge a serious protest with the Soviet Russian authorities, considering this an infringement of Polish sovereignty, as the arrival of the Soviet Russian fleet was not notified to the Polish authorities in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e64">German Parliamentary Re-elections Held Yesterday <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 6th: This morning, 44 million German voters will go to the provinces, where 35 million people will vote to elect members of the eighth post-war parliament. Many people expect this to be the last parliament elected according to the current constitution and electoral system, as both the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party are, in principle, opposed to the parliamentary system. The government party hopes that the constitutional reforms planned by Papen and his colleagues will fundamentally transform the next parliament. Currently, only the middle-class parties, the Bavarian People's Party, the Catholic Center Party, and the Social Democratic Party are willing to continue with the current constitution with slight modifications. Therefore, today's vote is essentially an expression of support for and opposition to parliament. Voting began at 9:00 AM and ended at 6:00 PM. The first to vote were President Hindenburg and then Prime Minister Papen, both at Wilhelmstrasse. The people greeted them with cheers. The streets were very quiet, as all demonstrations had been banned since midnight.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 6th: On the eve of the election, it rained appropriately, and there were almost no pedestrians on the streets. Berlin was shrouded in an atmosphere of mystery and unease, similar to the situation in Germany. The leaders of the various parties planned to issue final speeches in the evening, appealing to the people. Among them, one speech was particularly interesting, that of Center Party leader Kaas. Kaas did not attack the National Socialist Party at all, but expressed serious opposition to the current political system in serious terms, believing that the current optimism of Prime Minister Papen was similar to the optimism of the German government at the end of the Great War in 1918. He also criticized the government's foreign policy, saying, "The government protests against the various treaties imposed on Germany by other countries, but in domestic affairs, the government uses the same methods that foreign countries use to deal with the German people." Kaas also issued a serious warning in his conclusion, saying, "We will not become a revolutionary party, but legal resistance is more difficult to overcome than the obstacles set up by traitors."</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 6th: It is estimated that by 2:30 PM today, about 40% of voters had voted. Everything was peaceful. Two police aircraft flew in the sky, so that if unrest was spotted, it could be reported to headquarters by radio. Today, several buses were seen on the road, heavily guarded by police. The subway was running further and further away.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Rome, 5th: During the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Fascist troops' entry into Rome, an unprecedented amnesty will be announced. This amnesty decree was passed in the cabinet meeting today and has been submitted to San Rosso to ask the King to sign it, as the King is currently resting in San Rosso. As many as 10,000 people will be pardoned this time, all of whom are reactionary figures, both at home and abroad. Therefore, after the amnesty is announced, many exiles will be able to return home. In addition, during the 10th anniversary celebration, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will hold the opening ceremony of the Mussolini Memorial Hall. The building is made entirely of white marble and can accommodate 100,000 people. In front of it is a 100-foot-high statue of Mussolini, overlooking all other buildings around it.</p>

<p>Hoover Returns Home to Await Final Results</p>
<p>Two Black Men Arrested on Suspicion of Damaging Railroad Tracks</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th: President Hoover traveled 8,500 miles, gave more than ten major speeches, and has now returned to his home in California to await the election results with his wife. Democrat Roosevelt traveled 14,000 miles, gave twenty major speeches, and returned to New York tonight. According to observers, the enthusiastic propaganda of the past two weeks was a waste of words and money and may not be able to sway the opinions of the majority of voters. The chairman of the National Democratic Election Committee claimed that Roosevelt would definitely receive the full support of 48 states, but some Democrats also admitted that the Republican Party would definitely have an advantage in some states.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Pella, Wisconsin, USA, 5th: The police station received a message that an unknown person was plotting to derail the President's special train and sent several detectives to patrol the tracks and guard them overnight. The next morning, two black men were seen walking on the tracks with suspicious movements and were arrested.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madison (Wisconsin), 5th: Before President Hoover was about to arrive at the University of Wisconsin to give a speech today, three students were suddenly arrested, accused of stealing bombs and other chemical substances to make bombs. At the same time, the police in Pella, Wisconsin, also reported the arrest of a black man who attempted to remove steel nails from the railroad tracks that the President's special train was about to pass over. His name is being kept secret to facilitate investigation. As for the three arrested students, one named Harold, one named Krebs, and one named Inchberg, it is said that after the Socialist students held a meeting in the university gymnasium, the police found a letter on the ground, signed by Krebs, detailing the manufacturing of bombs. Because President Hoover was scheduled to speak near the gymnasium at 1:00 PM, the police arrested the three students for investigation. All three denied intending to use bombs, saying they were only studying explosive weapons. However, the police found wooden bombs in the three students' dormitory, which were elaborately manufactured and had actual explosives and caps on them. They only needed to throw a nail on the cap, and its force would cause the bomb to explode. US government agents are now working with the police to investigate the case.</p>

<p>Hoover Market Has Become a Thing of the Past, Master of the White House Will Belong to Roosevelt</p>
<p>North American Special Dispatch: The United States, with its eternal prosperity, is indeed extremely extravagant when prosperous, reaching its peak. But the more people enjoy themselves, the more ordinary their general life becomes. The films exported from the United States to the East and even around the world are sufficient to represent this aspect of ordinary life. However, since 1929, especially this year, the number of hungry people has increased, and the miserable state of veterans gathering in Washington makes people feel an overwhelming sense of nostalgia. ("The so-called motherland of many beggars, most people show signs of malnutrition") In the United States, there should be no such dangerous situation, right? But the reality is not so. Especially in the past year, it has become very poor. There are particularly many unemployed people. Cities are full of people looking for work. In the countryside, things cannot be sold, and even if they can be sold, they cannot be sold at a good price. If we look at it from our old habits, this is really a strange thing. Mountains of flour are piled up there, but people will starve to death. Warehouses of cloth are piled up there, but many people have no clothes to wear. The steel industry, the automobile industry, etc., have also suffered a setback. There is a lot of equipment, but there is no way to start work. The cash in the Federal Reserve has flowed out slightly this year, but it is still no less than 40 million US dollars, but the general public is still very poor. The capitalist American countryside is almost returning to the primitive agricultural era.</p>
<p>The "Hoover Market" was once extremely prosperous. The whole country sang and worshiped him. The president of the United States, although not as majestic as the emperor of the East, can rule peacefully for four years after he is elected, and realize his political ambitions without hindrance. When Mr. Hoover first came to power, he was indeed admired by women, and he implicitly guided the world with (national) power. However, after the economic panic struck, it was similar to Germany. Vast financial capital had no resistance. The talented and meticulous President Hoover had to burn the midnight oil and tried various methods of relief, but in the end, they were ineffective. In the blink of an eye, the four-year term is about to expire. The period of wind and rain has not yet passed, and the election period has come again. To incite the same market as in 1929, it is probably impossible in fact. However, we must try our best. Therefore, since the presidential candidate was designated, various stocks have risen sharply by more than double. But after all, the effect of air is vain, and it has fallen again after September. Although the Democratic Party does not have as many major industrial capitalists as the Republican Party, it has indeed gained the trend of winning the majority of voters in recent years. Although most of the presidents in American history belong to the Republican Party, the recent Democratic Party has risen twice. Let's look at the recent five presidents. Wilson County served twice (1913-1921). It was a Democratic regime. In addition, Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover were all Republican victories. As far as we induce, all re-elected presidents can be elected. What's more, Roosevelt, who is competing with Mr. Hoover this time, has a personal physique, which is not very healthy (he has suffered from paralysis). He is not fully healed yet. To stand up and compete with Hoover, there are inevitably many difficulties in fact. This is the trend in the early stages of the campaign.</p>
<p>As for the political platforms of the two parties, I think the newspapers in the country must have already recorded them, so there is no need to repeat them. Moreover, their political platforms are very ordinary, and there is nothing special about them. However, only two points are worth mentioning. The first is that since the promulgation of the Prohibition Law, most Americans have been drooling and hoping to lift the ban immediately. Therefore, although the Republican Party advocates Prohibition, it also indicates that it tends to amend the Prohibition Law. The Democratic Party directly advocates opening liquor tickets. The second is the issue of restoring the market and relieving unemployment. The Republican Party still adheres to the policy of protecting trade and defends its past efforts to restore the declining market. It also says that it has now been completed and the market has begun to retreat. On the Democratic Party side, it opposes protecting tariffs and opposes unreasonable overseas investment of hard-earned money. At the same time, it also advocates providing jobs for the unemployed. The two figures standing at the forefront of the election campaign are giving speeches everywhere, broadcasting on the radio, etc., turning over and over, all saying this kind of thing. Whether the current bad market has already begun to retreat, and whether financial tariffs can alleviate the current economic panic, we know if we use a calm mind and think carefully, it is still a problem.</p>
<p>However, the issue that occupies the most space in major American newspapers and is the most talked about event in the streets is still the election issue. Who is the winner of the election, Hoover or Roosevelt? Several major chambers in this city (New York) have conducted trial voting, and Roosevelt always wins more. At the same time, since 1921, the Republican Party has elected three presidents in a row, and the public is inevitably somewhat tired of Mr. Hoover. Regarding Prohibition, relieving unemployment, and restoring the market, they all feel that the Republican Party is not very competent. Therefore, the "Hoover Market" has become a thing of the past, and the future master of the White House is probably going to change people. What will the result be? It will be able to fully know on October 12th (October 12, 1932 in New York)</p>
<h3 id="e71">The Situation in Sichuan Becomes Increasingly Chaotic <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Launches General Offensive on Luzhou, Sets Deadline for Capture</p>
<p>Deng, Tian, and Liu Collude to Open Chongqing and Wanxian</p>
<p>Zhang Qun Discusses Sichuan Affairs in Detail with Various Representatives</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao reached an understanding, and there were rumors of a Chengdu conference, the situation in Sichuan has suddenly changed and is becoming increasingly chaotic. The strengths of the two Lius are essentially equal. The Chongqing side has a total of six divisions and various commanders' troops, totaling over 100 regiments, with more than 110,000 men. The provincial side also has six divisions and various troops, totaling about 90 regiments, with more than 104,000 men. Without the participation of a third party, it is impossible to determine victory or defeat. The forces of Deng and Tian thus hold significant weight. The two Lius are both doing their utmost to win them over as allies. Unexpectedly, Deng and Tian, while feigning compliance with Liu Xiang, continued to negotiate with Liu Wenhui, eventually reaching an agreement due to their long-standing close relationship as alumni, aiming to restrain Liu Xiang. Recently, the generals of the three divisions of Liu, Deng, and Tian, including Sun Decao, Dong Chang'an, Chen Shunong, Xiang Youren, Leng Yindong, Liu Fanjiu, etc., have met several times in Chengdu to discuss solutions thoroughly. Liu Xiang's side is desperately denying that Deng and Tian have taken this action, and Deng and Tian's side has not yet made any explicit statements. However, even the slightest clues are enough to warrant careful study. The sudden change in Deng and Tian's attitude may lead some to suspect that they will join forces with Liu Wenhui to attack Liu Xiang, but that is not the case. Deng and Tian benefit from the coexistence of the two Lius, as they check each other. Therefore, when the provincial Liu was strong, they allied with Liu Xiang; after the Chongqing Liu won, they compromised with Liu Wenhui. If Liu Xiang fails in his attack on Luzhou, Deng and Tian will inevitably be the ones to maintain Liu Xiang's position. However, aside from securing a portion of Liu Wenhui's defense area, the two Deng and Tian have other ambitions. What is their purpose? It is to open Chongqing and Wanxian. If Deng and Tian's goal is this, why wouldn't Yang Sen, Liu Cunhou, etc. also think the same? Moreover, the circular telegram sent by the second-tier generals originated from Chongqing, and the leading signatory was Tang Shizun, the division commander of the Chongqing army. The essence of the telegram is to break down defense zones. In the future, when Deng, Tian, Yang, and Liu raise the slogan of opening Chongqing and Wanxian, it will be difficult for Liu Xiang to refute them. However, he may not accept it so readily, so the extent of the chaos in Sichuan is something that we cannot predict today. Liu Xiang has long considered this point, so before Deng and Tian explicitly reveal their attitude, he is doing his utmost to maintain a false alliance, hoping to capture Luzhou and Neijiang in one fell swoop as a preemptive measure. On the 4th, he issued a second general offensive order, with three routes advancing on Luzhou. The vanguard is only 60 li away from Luzhou. The troops attacking Neijiang have also reached the border. Aircraft and warships are all at the front, and he is encouraging the soldiers to capture Luzhou and Neijiang within the deadline. A major battle is about to begin in the coming days. The Sichuan warlords are good at infighting, perhaps due to their inherent nature. As for the prolongation of the war and the suffering of the people, they hardly care. The central government and Chiang Kai-shek are now trying to get the two Lius to cease fighting. Chiang has strictly prohibited the transportation of munitions to Sichuan. Central Committee members Dai Chuanxian and Zhang Qun's arrival in Hankou also bears a significant mission in this regard. On the 5th, Liu Xiang's representative Qiu Jia, Deng Xihou's representative Cao Chichang, and Tian Songyao's representative Yang Jintang, etc., paid a visit to Zhang, presenting their opinions in detail and urging Zhang to visit Sichuan. It is said that Zhang indicated that as long as it is beneficial to Sichuan, going there is not out of the question, but now is not the time. Some representatives expressed concern that the governing edict for Sichuan issued by the National Government in its 17th year, and the ten measures proposed by the Central Committee members in Shanghai, may not be familiar with the situation in Sichuan and may still not be easy to implement in the future. They requested Zhang to draft another plan and submit it to Chiang for review. (November 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Atrocities of the Japanese Army in Fushun <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Over Two Thousand Residents of Pingdingshan Massacred</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: A gentleman who arrived in Beiping from Fushun yesterday spoke in detail about the situation in the county under the Japanese army's ravages. More than two thousand residents of Pingdingshan were massacred by Japanese machine guns, which can be described as extremely tragic. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Fushun County is located directly east of Liaoning Province, more than 70 li from the provincial capital. The Japanese operate coal mines and oil factories in Qianjinzhai, which belongs to the county. Since the September 18th Incident last year, before the establishment of the puppet state, the county government was reorganized almost five or six times in one month, all under the direction of Japanese advisors. The personnel of the county government and other agencies were merely used as servants. After the puppet organization was established, the heads of various agencies in the county, such as public security, finance, and education bureaus, were all replaced by Japanese-appointed pro-Japanese traitors. Those who were insincere or whose actions were slightly suspicious were put to death once discovered, so everyone was in danger and unsure of their fate. As a result, on September 4th, the Public Security Brigade revolted. The brigade commander, Li, and the deputy brigade commander, Xing, fearing Japanese suspicion and potential misfortune, secretly discussed the revolt and united the villagers in response. At one time, no less than several hundred people rose up in rebellion. In the beginning, they did not come into contact with the Japanese army, only leading their troops to station in the area bordering Xinfu in the south of the county. Thirteen Japanese soldiers went to Dadongzhou Village in the sixth district of the south of the county on September 8th for patrol and had lunch at the village chief's house. The villagers then attacked, killing one Japanese soldier and wounding another. The rest fled to Qianjinzhai Street. At 4 PM that afternoon, the Japanese army and the puppet army rushed to the village in large trucks to provide reinforcements. They killed anyone they saw upon entering the village. Fortunately, the villagers had fled in advance, so they burned seven houses in the village. Unexpectedly, at 8 AM the next morning, the Japanese army returned with hundreds of puppet soldiers and police, attacking Dadongzhou Village again, being extremely vicious, and leaving no chickens or dogs alive. They killed more than 20 villagers and set fire to all the houses in the village, destroying more than 500 rooms. All belongings were lost. Innocent villagers were brutally murdered, which is unprecedented. This is a rough account of the disaster in Dadongzhou Village in the county.</p>
<p>After the incident in early September, the Japanese army would occasionally patrol the villages. In any village that was suspected of being involved with the Big Swords or Volunteer Army, they would burn the village. A total of seven villages, large and small, were burned. Later, the Japanese transferred a thousand puppet guerrillas from Shenyang, led by Japanese officers to pursue the Volunteer Army. Although the Volunteer Army had a strength of four thousand, they dared not fight back due to the lack of guns and ammunition. When the Japanese army arrived at a village that the Volunteer Army had passed through, they would burn the village. The puppet guerrillas protested this inhuman act, saying that if such atrocities were to continue, they would lead their troops back to the province. The Japanese army then slightly stopped the burning of villages everywhere. On the night of September 15th (the Mid-Autumn Festival), about 800 Big Swordsmen suddenly came to Qianjinzhai Street, attacking from Pingdingshan Village in the east of the village. The Japanese army led the puppet police to fight, but they were unable to break through due to insufficient strength. The next day, the Japanese army suspected that the residents of Pingdingshan were colluding with the Big Swords Society, so they drove all the villagers, men, women, old and young, into a large pit in the southwest of the village, totaling more than 2,500 people, surrounded them on three sides, and opened fire with machine guns. All the villagers were brutally killed. Those who were not dead were searched for by the Japanese army with bayonets. Those who were found alive under the bodies were stabbed to death with bayonets. None of the more than 2,500 people survived. Their cruelty and brutality are unprecedented in the world. This is a general account of the villagers of Pingdingshan being killed.</p>
<p>The number of villagers in other villages who were innocently killed by the Japanese army is even more uncountable. The dates, names of the villages burned, and the number of deaths and injuries are listed below:</p>
<p>Village Name Date Number of Deaths</p>
<p>Dadongzhou September 9th 16</p>
<p>Xiaodongzhou September 9th 5</p>
<p>Qianjinzhai September 16th 3</p>
<p>Pingdingshan September 16th 2,500</p>
<p>Lizigou September 18th 2</p>
<p>Sijiazi September 24th 1</p>
<p>Xiawazi September 20th 3</p>
<h3 id="e73">Xiong Bin Arrives in Jinan, Will Go to Yexian <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the Ministry of Military Affairs issued an order to resolve the Jiaodong dispute, it also appointed Jiang Bocheng, Gao Lingbai, and Xiong Bin to supervise the withdrawal and transfer of troops from both sides. Jiang Bocheng remained in Jinan to supervise the Third Route Army, while Gao Lingbai, after contacting Shen Honglie, just arrived in Jinan from Qingdao and is scheduled to return to Qingdao at 10 PM tonight to board the Zhenhai warship with the marines to take over defenses in Yantai on the 5th. Xiong Bin, Director of the General Affairs Department of the General Staff Headquarters, departed from Beijing on the evening of the 3rd and arrived in Jinan on the Pingpu 202 train at 6 PM tonight. Han Fuju and Jiang Bocheng, etc., all went to the station to welcome him. Xiong got off the train with his secretary, Lu Bangjian, shook hands with the welcomers one by one, and then took a car to the Jiaoji Hotel to rest. When the press went to visit him, Xiong said that he came here on orders to go to Yexian to supervise the 21st Division. Chairman Han has obeyed the central government's orders, and Liu Zhennian has also repeatedly telegraphed the ministry to express his obedience. The Jiaodong incident can thus be peacefully resolved. However, although the Third Route Army has withdrawn, the administrative officials appointed by the provincial government are still in the defense area. The maintenance of local security and the safety of the administrative personnel of the provincial government within the defense area are extremely important. Therefore, after arriving in Jinan, I will first discuss measures with Chairman Han, and then send someone to Yexian to contact Liu once. I can go to Yexian in about three to five days. As for the withdrawal plan, the first step is for the navy to go to Yantai, and after the Third Route Army takes over the defense duties, it will go to the vicinity of Yexian. The second step is for each to return to their original defense positions. Once the central government has withdrawn the Third Route Army, it will order the transfer of Liu Zhennian's troops out of Shandong. At the same time, the central government will send ships to Yantai and Longkou to wait for the transportation of Liu's troops. However, where Liu's troops will be transferred to, and which troops will fill the defense after Liu's troops are transferred, is still unknown. Unless there are special circumstances, it is not certain that other filling troops will be sent. Before I departed from Beijing yesterday, I sent a telegram to Liu Zhennian, informing him of my scheduled departure. Because the telegram was forwarded by Yantai, it was very slow, so I have not yet received a reply. (November 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Northern Fujian Red Bandits Retreat to the Jiangxi Border <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Liu's Division Enters Jianyang and Jiangle</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the Red bandits Zhu De and Lin Biao's forces rampaged through northern Fujian from eastern Jiangxi, Mao Bingwen and Chen Cheng's armies from Jiangxi had advanced to Lichuan and Guangchang. Fearing that their route of return would be cut off, Zhu first withdrew from Jianning to Shicheng on the Jiangxi border to maintain rear communications, leaving only Lin Biao's force in Tai'ning to command the bandits in Shaowu and Guangze. However, the original plan for the Red bandits' entry into Fujian was to advance simultaneously on the northwest routes, but now that the west route has been withdrawn, the north route is also shaken and dares not go deep. Therefore, starting the day before yesterday, they first transported all the looted salt, rice, cloth, and cotton to their old nest on the Fujian-Jiangxi border (in the mountains bordering Tai'ning and Guangchang) for winter supplies. Then, the troops retreated along the original route. Liu Hemei, commander of the 56th Division, telegraphed the province from Jian'ou yesterday to report that there were no traces of bandits in Jianyang and Jiangle counties. The bandits in Shaowu and Guangze counties are also heading towards Tai'ning. He has now ordered the Liu Shangzhi Brigade stationed in Jian'ou to enter Jianyang, and the Gui Zhenyuan Brigade stationed in Shunchang to enter Jiangle and advance towards Shaowu and Guangze. However, after this great calamity, the local population is displaced, and their savings are exhausted. There is an urgent need to gather the refugees and return them to their homes and allocate funds for relief. The authorities are currently coordinating measures. In addition, the defense forces of the provincial capital have recently been transferred to Putian, Xianyou, Minqing, Gutian, and Yongtai counties to deploy defenses, and the military strength is quite weak. The provincial government has transferred the second regiment of the first marine brigade of the stationed Xiamen garrison, commanded by Huang Maohe, and the 183rd brigade of the 61st Division stationed in Quanzhou, commanded by Zhang Yan, to the province for garrison duty. Huang's regiment arrived in the province yesterday and is stationed in the Jiangnan area. Zhang's brigade will also arrive tomorrow and is scheduled to be stationed inside the city and outside the east, west, and north gates.</p>
<p>The Aviation Corps organized by the Pacification Headquarters has also been established, appointing Yang Anyu as the brigade commander, and Deng Yueming and Liu Zhiyan as deputy brigade commanders, with an office set up at the Wangzhuang Airport outside the Shuibu Gate. It has seven aircraft under its jurisdiction, namely one in Fuzhou, four in Xiamen, and two in Zhangzhou. As for the aircraft purchased with donations from overseas Chinese, five can be obtained from the French territory, ten from the British territory, and ten from the American territory, which are also being negotiated.

<h3 id="e75">Guangdong Province Reorganizes Local Defense Forces <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>First, Inspectors are Sent to Investigate Various Regions</p>
<p>The Province Plans to Establish Defense Offices by Region</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The military authorities of Guangdong Province have recently planned to reorganize the local defense forces throughout the province in order to establish a foundation for local self-defense military strength. According to the plan, after the current five Pacification District Offices are abolished, a Provincial Defense Headquarters will be organized to facilitate command and control. The organizational methods of the Defense Headquarters have been handed over to the Military Affairs Office of the First Army Group Headquarters for drafting. Recently, a draft of over 50 articles has been completed. The headquarters has now submitted it to the General Staff Office for review. The outline is to divide the provincial defense forces into five districts for jurisdiction. However, the establishment of the defense districts involves the issue of the existence and abolition of the Pacification District Offices, which the authorities must carefully consider. It is currently the winter defense season, and the defense forces in various regions are working to suppress bandits and stabilize the local area. If there are any reforms to the pacification system, it will affect the current pacification efforts in various districts. Therefore, the headquarters has been holding meetings with senior military officers for several days to discuss the emergence of the Defense Headquarters and the existence and abolition of the five Pacification District Offices in detail. On the 29th of last month, the First Army Group Headquarters held another meeting, attended by the chiefs of the headquarters and the members of the Pacification District Offices, totaling over 20 people. As a result, it was decided that the current Pacification District Offices would be temporarily maintained and continue to implement the original pacification plan, but the county defense forces would be directly managed by each district. Each district will set up a Defense Office to command the defense forces in the district and actively engage in reorganization. Only after the training of the local defense forces in each county is completed will the Pacification District Offices be abolished. The headquarters has sent out several defense inspectors to various districts to inspect the east, south, west, and central regions to plan the reorganization of the defense forces. The inspector of the east region set out today (the 1st), and the rest will follow suit. Once the inspectors return to the province after their investigation, the plan to reorganize the defense forces throughout the province will be implemented. The reorganization plan for the defense forces drafted by the Military Affairs Office roughly imitates the organization of the militia in Guangxi Province. The province will be divided into several defense districts, with one commander of the general defense force in each district, and one commander in each county, who will be concurrently held by the county magistrate. The original defense force commander will then be reassigned as the deputy commander. However, this plan can only be realized after the training of the defense forces in each county has reached a considerable level. (November 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Current Situation in Qinghai <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Gaolan Correspondence: Qinghai is located on the western frontier, and coupled with inconvenient transportation, little is known about the internal situation of Qinghai. I have long had the determination to travel there, but due to various reasons, I did not go until the time of the Qinghai Sea Sacrifice this year. The round trip took twenty-seven days. Traveling in this short period of time, coupled with unfamiliarity with the place and language barriers with the Mongolians and Tibetans, it is naturally impossible to conduct a detailed investigation. I can only write down a few words about what I saw and heard to report to the readers.</p>
<p>(1) The Sea Sacrifice The origin of the Sea Sacrifice is often shrouded in superstition, but after experiencing it, I will describe it for what it is worth. In the second year of the Yongzheng reign of the Qing Dynasty, Wang's army was dispatched to conquer the rebel party of Arbutan Wenbu. When they pursued them to the Ikharj River on the north bank of Nuoer (i.e., Qinghai), the men and horses were very thirsty and could not find water. Suddenly, a spring gushed out, trickling into a stream. The soldiers and horses drank and were no longer tired. The crowd cheered and bravely captured the rebel leader. The governor-general reported to the Qing court that Qinghai had been efficacious, and the Qing court ordered the god of Qinghai to be enshrined, and a monument was erected to pay tribute. This is the origin of the annual Sea Sacrifice.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Important News Updates <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Also, according to the regulations of the former Court of Colonial Affairs, a sea sacrifice in Qinghai was mandatory every year, and all the princes and dukes from various places were required to gather and participate. Absence without a valid reason would result in a report by high-ranking officials and a three-year salary deduction for the Jasak. It was also stipulated that the Qinghai Minister would annually convene the Jasaks for an alliance meeting. Later, due to the inconvenience of traveling back and forth, the sea sacrifice and alliance meeting were combined into one event, which has continued unchanged to this day.</p>
<p>The journey starts from Xining, goes out of the west gate, crosses Tongji Bridge, and travels 25 miles west along the south bank of the Huangshui River, passing Yinshantang, and then another 25 miles to Zhenhaibao. Traditionally, the sea sacrifice is held every year, and the Xining County prepares meals here, and the chief official in charge of the sea sacrifice has a snack here. Because the reporter was traveling with Zhong Xingzai, the representative of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, he had the pleasure of enjoying a hearty meal of mutton. After ten miles, cross the Huangshui Bridge to Zhamalong, and travel along the north bank of the Huangshui River, entering the Xishi Gorge. After 30 miles, you reach Huangyuan City. Huangyuan, formerly known as Dangar, is an important town in Qinghai. Tibetan people and people of various counties of the Republic, Guide, and Dulan come to trade here every year after September, bringing all kinds of furs, antlers, musk, and other goods to exchange for grain and tea. Merchants from the mainland who are familiar with the Tibetan language can all make profits here. Therefore, commerce is more prosperous here than in other counties. However, in August of the 18th year of the Republic, the Hui bandits captured the city, killing 3,000 people, and many shops and houses were burned. Therefore, the vitality has not yet recovered, and the market is bleak. The climate here is very cold, and the residents have a strong addiction to alcohol. Every family's wine jars are never empty. When drinking, they exchange toasts and insist on getting drunk. They don't stop until they take off their hats, expose their heads, and collapse on the ground. After getting drunk, they stumble on the road, and even close relatives do not care about them. There are five schools in the city, including one senior primary school, three junior primary schools, and one two-level girls' school. Traveling south from here for 60 miles, you reach Tu'ergan, next to Dongquo Temple, which is the main temple of the inner eight Hutuktu Kuo Buddhas. After 30 miles, you reach Riyue Mountain, which is the border between Huangyuan and the Republic counties. There is a boundary stone on the south side of the mountain, inscribed with "Southwest Boundary of Fangal." Although the mountain peak is small, the climate is cold because the terrain is even higher than Xining. The only food is green barley, and barley and oats can still mature. There are houses on the north side of the mountain, hidden in the hills and valleys, which are said to be people from the mainland who fled here due to famine. To the south, the grass is lush, and the view is desolate, with no villages. After 30 miles, you reach Chahan City, the site of the sea sacrifice, which belongs to the northwest of the Republic County, 120 miles northeast of Huangyuan. The city was built by Na Yan, the Governor-General of Shaanxi and Gansu in the third year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, to station troops, set up defenses, and control the wild tribes. In the sixth year of Xianfeng, the defense was withdrawn, and the city was also abandoned. Now there is only a circle of earthen walls, and the battlements have collapsed. There are several public offices inside, most of which have collapsed. Outside the city to the north is the Sea God Temple, where the Qinghai Chief Officer comes every autumn to sacrifice to the sea. To the west is General's Terrace. This area is purely populated by the Qianbulu tribe of Tibetan people, who all live in tents, mostly near the water's edge. From a distance, they look like ashes left after cooking, and it is difficult for those unfamiliar with them to distinguish them. Looking west, the Qinghai Lake is azure blue, like a large piece of brocade being washed. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I could not go to the shore for a closer look.</p>
<p>Qinghai Lake has a circumference of more than 500 miles and an area of 18,500 square miles. The water surface is 10,500 feet above sea level. The deepest part of the water is about 120 feet. The water is very clear and tastes salty and delicious. There are many fish in the water, but the Tibetan people are not used to eating fish. Therefore, there are many fish in the lake. In recent years, some people have been catching and selling them to the mainland. The yellow fish from Lanzhou are caught from Qinghai Lake. In summer, fishermen dig canals along the coast and divert water to the grassland. The fish then gather along the canals in dense grass. Fishermen kill them with sticks, open their bellies, remove their internal organs, and lay them on the ground. The ground is rich in salt, so they do not rot. After drying, they are transported to the mainland for sale. In winter, the seawater freezes, and fishermen chisel ice to get fish, called frozen fish, which are also transported and sold to the mainland. There are two islands in the sea, one is called Haixin Mountain, and the other is called Haixin West Mountain. There are small temples on them, and Tibetan monks who practice Zen meditation here come out in winter when the ice is solid to get a year's worth of food to live in. It is said that the water force is very weak, and even a mustard seed cannot float. In the summer of 1907, Mr. Kochzlov, a member of the Russian Royal Geographical Society, reached Haixin Mountain with a sailboat, causing great fear among the Mongolians, who thought it was a god. When Nian Gengyao conquered Qinghai, the residents said it was the god of the sea, because the sea water surged when Nian arrived, so it was the sea dragon coming to court. There is a salt pond in the southwest of the sea, which produces a very large amount of salt, with a blue color and delicious taste. It is easy to collect. Just break the salt crust of the small pond with a hammer, and you can take it at will. Without manufacturing, it is a fine product. After taking it, the water will form a crust again after a month, and salt will grow inside again. It can be taken in a cycle endlessly, and it is transported by Tibetan people with yaks, and others cannot. Because the road is far and sparsely populated, bandits often rob and kill pedestrians. The Sea God Temple is 50 miles from the sea and was built by Qing Shu, the Xining Affairs Minister in the 33rd year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. The buildings are extremely simple and crude. There are several wing rooms inside, which are badly damaged. To the north is the Sea God Hall. In the center of the hall is a stone tablet with the inscription "The God of Qinghai Manifests." Every autumn, the Qinghai authorities send letters to summon the Mongolian princes and dukes for the annual alliance ceremony, which is held at this temple.</p>
<p>In the past, the sea sacrifice has not been taken seriously since the Republic of China. This year, the Qinghai authorities felt the necessity of contacting the Mongolians and Tibetans because of the Yushu Incident. Therefore, Chairman Ma decided to participate in person in advance. The central government, feeling the importance of the Northwest, sent personnel to supervise, which has not happened in 21 years. The date of the sacrifice was originally scheduled for September 20, but was later changed to the 23rd because Chen Jingxiu, the representative of the central government, had not arrived, and Zhong Xingzai, the representative of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, only arrived in Xining on the 20th. The Mongolian banner princes, either participated in person, sent Taijis, or sent representatives, all gathered ahead of time. Many Tibetan tribal chiefs also participated. The princes in yellow jackets and white hats, and the tribal chiefs in red long sleeves, gathered together, with different costumes and different languages. However, a sense of cordiality overflowed from their brows. At 8 a.m. on the 23rd, the sea sacrifice ceremony was held at the Sea God Temple in Chahan City. The ceremony was quite grand.</p>
<p>After the sea sacrifice alliance meeting held in the past, a banquet should be held, and Dongquo Temple was used as the banquet venue. The temple is located in Tu'ergan, 60 miles from Chahan City. After the sea sacrifice this time, Chairman Ma ordered the translator to convey to the Mongolian and Tibetan princes and tribal chiefs to return to Dongquo Temple to gather for a banquet. At one time, they spurred their horses and galloped, vying to be the first. At 8 a.m. on the 24th, a banquet was set up in front of the sutra hall of Dongquo Temple. Chairman Ma, Representative Zhong, and Division Commander Ma and others sat in the middle seat, and the reporter also got a seat. The left side was the seat for the left-wing Mongolian chiefs and princes, the right side was the seat for the right-wing Mongolian chiefs and princes, and the lower side was the seat for the tribal chiefs. Small tables were set up on the ground. A raw sheep was placed in front of the upper table, and sugar, wine, and fruits were placed on the table. The rewards of Chairman Ma and Representative Zhong were also placed on the table. The seating arrangements and gifts were based on the level of status. In previous years, the tribal chiefs scrambled for seats, and the awards were given by calling out their names. This year, the principle of equality for all was adopted, and seats were set up for each. However, according to those familiar with the situation of the Mongolians and Tibetans, although this move was considered a great honor by the Tibetan people, the Mongolians were ashamed to be associated with the Tibetan people. However, in view of the current situation, the strength of the Tibetan tribal chiefs is indeed greater than that of the Mongolians. After sitting down, Chairman Ma led everyone to salute the portrait of the Prime Minister, and then the banquet began. During the banquet, Chairman Ma and Representative Zhong both gave earnest speeches on unity and resistance against foreign aggression. Finally, a banquet robbery was held. Fruits and mutton were placed in the courtyard. As soon as the master of ceremonies shouted the words "banquet robbery," everyone gathered in the courtyard, vying to be the first, pushing and shoving each other, and fighting fiercely. It is said in Qing customs that eating the food that is robbed will prevent illness for a year, so they are so enthusiastic. After the banquet, the princes and tribal chiefs ordered their servants to carry meat and wine, and carry gifts, and thanked Chairman Ma happily before leaving. This grand ceremony was completed. ㈡ Qinghai Politics Qinghai was the ancient Xiqiang. During the Qin Dynasty, it was called Huangzhong. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty drove away the various Qiang tribes and built new settlements. During the reign of Emperor Xuan of the Han Dynasty, Zhao Chongguo attacked the Xianling Qiang tribes and established Poqiang County, and garrisoned troops on the Huangshui River. The relics are still there today, reminding people of the work of developing the Northwest. The ancients also did it before us, but unfortunately, later generations could not continue it. During the Jian'an period of the Han Dynasty, Xiping County was established. At the end of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, Tuoba Wu, the prince of Southern Liang, occupied it as the capital. It was driven away by the Later Wei Dynasty. During the Sui Dynasty, the county was abolished. Liu Quan also garrisoned troops here. During the Tang Dynasty, it fell into Tubo. In the early Song Dynasty, it belonged to Western Xia, and later it was occupied by Tubo again. It was not until the Yuan Dynasty that it was called Xining, belonging to Gansu Province, and belonging to the Shaanxi Branch Secretariat. Mongolian tribes began to invade and live with the Tibetans. Some say that tens of thousands of Hui people also moved into Xining during the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty, but there is no proof. The Hui people in Xining, except for the Salar, mostly moved in during the Qing Dynasty. The Qing Dynasty pacified the Mongolians and Tibetans and changed it back to a prefecture. In the Republic of China, it was changed to a circuit. It was not until the winter of the 17th year that it was changed to Qinghai Province. Qinghai has a vast area. Yushu County is almost equal to Shaanxi Province. In addition, there are mixed ethnic groups, and there have been many rebellions. Taking Guoluo as an example, although Ma Xunchen led troops to conquer it the year before last, only the queen went to Xining, and the rest had nothing to do with it. However, the Ma family, father, son, uncle, and nephew, have a history of more than 30 years in Xining, and they are familiar with the situation. The results of their administration are not bad. At present, there are almost no bandits in the entire territory, and opium seedlings have disappeared. Prince Ziyuan, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, can adapt to the environment and work hard, so the civil affairs of Qinghai are still commendable. It is a pity that the ethnic groups are complex, and the Tibetan people have their own customs and regulations, which is inconvenient in judicial matters. Mongolian, Tibetan, and local ethnic groups have their own political systems, which often hinders administration. Even Jia Jia Ahong sometimes interferes in politics with religion. Although the provincial government has tried to improve this, it has not achieved significant results due to various restrictions. Although there was an agreement to integrate the local rulers into the regular administration, the local rulers still monopolize one side. Recently, the Civil Affairs Department plans to set up counties throughout the province and transform the princes and tribal chiefs into district chiefs, but it has not been implemented due to various reasons.</p>

<p>The consuls of various countries in Harbin often declare that they deeply believe that Japan cannot improve this serious situation and must implement certain concessions to gain peace. Furthermore, they all believe that the friendship between Japan and the Soviet Union is temporary and very dangerous for Japan. They all predict that the friendship between Japan and Russia will definitely break off suddenly. The strength of the communists in Manchuria is now much greater than it was at the time of the incident. The American Consulate in Harbin is completely opposed to Japan and is trying to expand the issue of demanding that foreign troops come to Harbin to protect foreigners. The American Consulate is now collecting various materials to prove the illegal acts of the Japanese army and the cruelty to Chinese civilians. The White Russian expatriates in Harbin have also helped to collect materials, and those that have been obtained have been sent to the United States. Furthermore, the consul is now paying close attention to the anti-Japanese ideas of the White Russian expatriates and plans to open a Russian newspaper in Harbin to resist the Russian newspaper "Orara" run by the Japanese.</p>
<p>3. The following news came the latest: The Korean organizations in the northeastern part of Manchuria have recently expanded their work to restore the freedom of Mongolia and Korea. Now, even the Chinese anti-Japanese groups near that area have joined the organization. The purpose of the organization is to take advantage of the Sino-Japanese conflict and cooperate with the local Chinese army to establish a Sino-Korean army to resist Japan. According to the news obtained, their work is not only subsidized by the Soviet Union but also secretly aided financially by the American side within Manchuria. The leaders of the organization believe that the Korean officers in the Japanese army will also join their organization in the future. As for the newly established so-called "Manchurian Army" in the Liaoning and Jilin provinces, it will not hinder them in any way, because the "Manchurian Army" has often confronted the Japanese army with the guns after receiving them. Furthermore, they also believe that the civil servants in the Manchurian government agencies and the Chinese people in the areas where the Japanese army is stationed are now no more than captives, so they will never assist Japan. The following news, although delayed for many days, shows the attitude of the "Manchurian Army" toward Japan. (A) On July 25, a regiment of the "Manchurian Army" in Jilin City revolted because the Japanese instructors treated the soldiers very badly. (B) At 4 p.m. on July 27, a regiment of the "Manchurian Army" in Changchun City had an armed conflict with the Japanese army. Both sides suffered losses. Afterward, the Chinese army regiment retreated elsewhere. The Japanese instructors in the regiment were all killed by the soldiers at the beginning of the conflict. (C) On July 31, about 2,000 volunteer soldiers attacked Changchun and had reached the vicinity of Nanyingfang. At the same time, there were gunshots firing at various government agencies throughout Changchun, and the backyard of the Japanese Yamatohatel Hotel was also broken in many places by bullets. At that time, all the shops in the city were closed, and the puppet government declared martial law. The gunshots did not stop all night, and several shells fired by the volunteer soldiers fell on the Jilin Railway Station. After that, barricades and machine gun bunkers were set up at all intersections throughout the city, and Japanese troops were assigned to duty to defend. (D) On August 2, a group of police officers in Fengchun were ordered to go to the countryside. At that time, a riot occurred, opposing the Japanese police chief in Changchun. (E) The battles in Liaoyang and Yingkou had raised the anti-Japanese will of the local people and incited the local civilians to riot several times. (F) On August 15, a regiment of the "Manchurian Army" at Sanyouhe revolted and joined the volunteer army, and transported all the weapons, ammunition, clothing, and supplies away in large carts. They also captured all the officers of the artillery company stationed there and transported the artillery and ammunition with the regiment. (G) Every time Japan dispatched small units of the "Manchurian Army" to attack the volunteer army, they often discussed with the volunteer army leaders to allow them to retreat and then return to report to their superiors, falsely claiming that the volunteer army had been defeated. In short, the current serious situation in Manchuria is unprecedented before the Japanese army occupied Manchuria. Advisor Mulan Chi Weilie presented, October 21, (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Overview of Machine Irrigation in Wuxi <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Founded First by Xi Du Ding Biao</p>
<p>There are Now 2,000 Operating Machine Boats</p>
<p>A positive way to relieve rural areas is to start by improving agricultural tools. Electric irrigation in the Suxi area has proven effective, but since power plants are not yet widespread, the use of machine power instead of human and animal power is also worthy of attention. After investigating the irrigation area in Wuxi, a newspaper reporter took the opportunity to inquire about the status of machine drainage in Wuxi. The findings of the field visit are recorded below. The inventor of the water drainage machine was Ding Biao from Xiaoxuankou, Kaiyuan Township, Wuxi. Mr. Ding had never been engaged in industry. He was a farmer who also supplemented his income by raising fish. In the first year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty, there was a major flood. When the fish ponds were full, there was concern of collapse. Drainage by people and animals was both slow and wasteful. In a state of anxiety day and night, he invented a machine to replace human and animal power. At first, he only hired workers to draw a sample and made a small-scale engine to drive the original waterwheel. After several improvements, he created a machine made purely of iron and steel. Since then, curious people have also imitated it, but society has not paid much attention to it. Only then did several farmers set up a machine on a boat in the nature of a company. In addition to self-use, they were also hired by others, and their profits were quite abundant. In the 14th and 15th years of the Republic, the weather was extremely dry, and human and animal power were exhausted and ineffective. Machine drainage became very effective. Water drainage machines are divided into diesel and kerosene types, and there are also kerosene and diesel dual-use types. The names are "horizontal diesel engine" ("vertical diesel engine"), "irrigation pump" (also known as "water wind box"), and "water drainage and rice milling dual-purpose machine," etc. The horsepower ranges from six to twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, and twenty-four horsepower. The price is calculated by horsepower. Diesel engines are 65 yuan per horsepower, and kerosene engines are 50 yuan. The most common is a 14-horsepower diesel engine. Including the boat, the total cost is 2,000 yuan, which farmers cannot directly afford to purchase. Machine boat operation has become an intermediate society. There are about 2,000 operating machine boats in the whole county. More than 1,310 boats have joined the association, and about 300 have not joined the association. In addition, they are scattered to neighboring counties. In the territory, districts 3, 5, 6, 11, 13, and 12 are the most common, all contracting fields according to value. This summer, due to the extreme drought, drainage day and night still caused losses to many. The average contracted price per mu is 1.8 yuan for high fields, 1.6 yuan for flat fields, and 1.4 yuan for low fields. The leading manufacturing factories are Gongyi, followed by Hezhong, and then Zhendan. There are more than 50 factories of various sizes, such as Xiangxing and Fuxing. The Model Irrigation Bureau organized by the Construction Committee once gathered pumps from factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, and Changzhou at the Changzhou First Irrigation Area for testing in the previous year. Gongyi's results were the best, and 100 units were ordered. Subsequently, the purchase reached 300 units. Last year, the Guangdong Construction Department also quickly purchased 50 units. In addition, they are also distributed in various provinces such as Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, and Shandong. Zhendan Factory was established later, but the owner has a strong enterprising spirit, and the products are getting better and better. They are sold in provinces such as Zhejiang, Sichuan, Anhui, and Guangdong. The factory has recently launched a new type of 7-horsepower light and convenient high-lift water pump, weighing only 600 pounds net, equipped with a 4-inch diameter pump, which can discharge 220 gallons of water per minute. Equipped with a 5-inch diameter pump, it can discharge 350 gallons of water per minute. Its uses are not limited to drainage. It can also be used for engineering drainage, building high water towers, firefighting, power generation, and rice milling. Other various machine parts can also be driven by it.

<p>Court Trial Record of the Xiecheng Pawnshop Lawsuit: The Lou Tang Xiecheng Pawnshop claimed that the pawned items were lost during the looting in the war, and those with an original pawn value of one yuan were only refunded six cents. The pawnshop customers jointly filed a lawsuit accusing the pawnshop of swallowing the pawned items. The county government continued the court hearing on the afternoon of the 5th. Ten representatives of the plaintiffs arrived, and Ren Shancheng was appointed as the representative to claim that the pawned items stored in the pawnshop were not looted. Only the head ornaments were. According to the defendant, they were transported to the Jiading Jiping Pawnshop for deposit and storage, which led to the loss. Therefore, the pawnshop should be responsible. Please order the court to redeem the items according to the pawn ticket. The defendant, Wang Renfu, confessed that Jiping and Xiecheng were originally managed by Yao Weisheng. Xiecheng's head ornaments were looted in Jiading. Xiang Jian'an confessed that he was the manager of Xiecheng. The clothes were transported to Shanghai and were slightly lost, estimated at hundreds of yuan. He also submitted a list of losses. Witness Xuan Bao confessed that during the war, he traveled with Wang Xiaoshan from Waigang, transporting the pawned items of Xiecheng Pawnshop to Shanghai. There were no losses along the way. Ren Shancheng said that the pawnshop had already been pending redemption and would be closed at the end of the year. Yao Weisheng, the general manager of the pawnshop, had been summoned many times but had not arrived. He requested that he be arrested and brought to justice so that the case could be closed as soon as possible. The court ruled that the case needed to be investigated further and scheduled another hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Ministry of Education Promulgates Measures for Service and Treatment of Faculty and Staff in Secondary Schools <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issues a circular to the Education Bureaus of all provinces and cities, stating: The purpose of secondary education is, on the one hand, to cultivate healthy citizens and make them the backbone of society, and on the other hand, to cultivate the foundation of higher education and prepare them for employment. Its importance is closely related to all levels of education. At present, the effectiveness of secondary education in our country is still quite limited. The reasons are certainly manifold, but the unsuitability of school administration and the neglect of student discipline are the most important factors. These are discussed separately below.</p>
<p>The sole aim of all facilities in school administration is to improve the efficiency of education. Given the difficulties of education in various parts of our country, school facilities must carefully weigh priorities and adopt the most economical and effective methods. Today, principals of secondary schools in various places do not teach and resemble the heads of administrative organs. Teachers are paid by the hour, and their salaries are often meager. They fear that their teaching hours are insufficient. They have no leisure to further their studies, and their salaries are insufficient to support their families. In terms of administrative affairs, officials are appointed indiscriminately, public funds are wasted, teachers' salaries cannot be raised, and facilities cannot be established. This kind of malpractice is especially prevalent in public schools. If we want to improve the efficiency of education, but instead hinder and stagnate it, this is the first thing that urgently needs improvement.</p>
<p>In recent years, the academic atmosphere of secondary schools has declined, and the blame is generally placed on the mismanagement of discipline. However, the real problem is the lack of suitable personnel. Since the implementation of the system of paying teachers by the hour, its most negative impact has been that anything outside of class time is not the teacher's responsibility. The important task of discipline is entrusted to the so-called discipline personnel, who are generally less qualified and unable to honestly teach. Students have little faith in them, and even good regulations are difficult to enforce. Over time, school rules are disregarded, and various bad behaviors arise. Their thoughts and feelings are further dominated by the trends of the times, and their innate qualities react in an unrestrained manner. Education's power to change temperament and overcome the environment is completely lost. Those who are teachers should take it as their duty to establish themselves and others. It is not just about teaching and resolving doubts. Today's teachers only limit themselves to teaching knowledge and do not bear the heavy responsibility of discipline. This makes students only know that going to school is solely for acquiring knowledge, and nothing else matters. Over time, the academic atmosphere cannot but decline. This is the second thing that urgently needs improvement.</p>
<p>The Ministry has specially formulated the Outline of Measures for Service and Treatment of Faculty and Staff in Secondary Schools, which are hereby issued to all concerned. In terms of school administration, we will strive for rationalization and economization. Salaries that have been wasted on faculty and staff in the past, except for hourly wages, will be used to increase teachers' salaries. School affairs will be assigned to teachers, and the spirit of teachers assisting the principal in governing the school together will be realized. In terms of student discipline, we will strive to eliminate the previous drawbacks of separating discipline from teaching, so that all teachers bear the responsibility of discipline. The principal will designate some teachers to concurrently take charge of discipline, establishing the foundation of character education. However, given the vast territory of our country and the different conditions in various places, the salary grades of faculty and staff in secondary schools in each province and city, the assignment of school affairs to teachers, and the concurrent assignment of discipline matters should be promptly formulated separately by the bureaus in accordance with local conditions and based on this outline, and reported to the Ministry for approval. It is expected that from the next semester, the discipline measures of secondary schools nationwide can be corrected. From the next school year, the education salary measures will also be uniformly revised, so that the efficiency of secondary education will be enhanced and the entire education system will be promoted. All bureaus should strictly comply with these instructions and forward them to their subordinates for compliance. This order includes a copy of the Outline of Measures for Service and Treatment of Faculty and Staff in Secondary Schools.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Outline of Measures for Service and Treatment of Faculty and Staff in Secondary Schools <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>1. Secondary schools should be jointly governed by faculty and staff, assisted by the principal. All school administration and discipline matters should be handled separately by the principal's appointed full-time teachers and part-time educators.</p>
<p>2. Secondary schools shall abolish the hourly wage system. The monthly salaries of faculty and staff shall be graded and advanced in order. Part-time teachers may be paid by the hour. All provinces and bureaus shall stipulate regulations based on local living standards and better current practices.</p>
<p>3. All provinces and cities shall make every effort to promote the annual salary increase system and the measures stipulated in the regulations on teacher and staff retirement pensions and survivor benefits.</p>
<p>4. The in-class teaching time for full-time teachers in junior high schools shall be 22 to 26 hours per week, and the in-class teaching time for full-time teachers in senior high schools shall be 20 to 24 hours per week. If there are special circumstances in various places that require an increase, both senior and junior high schools may increase the amount as appropriate.</p>
<p>5. The principal of a secondary school must undertake teaching, and the time must not be less than one-half of the minimum teaching time of a full-time teacher, and no separate salary shall be paid.</p>
<p>6. The teaching time for the director of academic affairs and the director of student affairs may be reduced as appropriate for full-time teachers, but must not be less than two-thirds of the prescribed minimum. If there is a director of general affairs, the teaching time should also be determined according to this regulation.</p>
<p>7. If the number of teaching hours in a subject in a secondary school is sufficient for the prescribed number of hours for a full-time teacher, or if the number of teaching hours in a subject is insufficient, and the number of hours in other subjects with similar properties is combined to reach the prescribed number of hours for a full-time teacher, a full-time teacher should be hired immediately.</p>
<p>8. The number of part-time teachers in a school shall not exceed one-fifth of the total number of teachers. Part-time teachers shall be limited to the three subjects of music, drawing, and manual arts in principle.</p>
<p>9. Full-time teachers are absolutely not allowed to hold concurrent positions outside the school.</p>
<p>10. Full-time teachers must share the responsibility of guiding students' extracurricular self-study. Part-time teachers should also guide students' extracurricular self-study once or twice a week.</p>
<p>11. The principal and all teachers must bear the responsibility of discipline. The full-time positions such as director of student affairs and discipline officers must be held concurrently by full-time teachers.</p>
<p>12. Full-time teachers who concurrently hold positions such as academic affairs and discipline should be paid a higher monthly salary.</p>
<p>13. In addition to the use of specialists for accounting and general affairs, and for matters such as writing, secondary schools may use a very small number of clerks and secretaries, and must not indiscriminately establish any official positions.</p>
<p>14. If necessary for practical reasons, secondary vocational schools may use a very small number of related technical assistants.</p>
<p>...enters the Yangtze River. This is truly a critical moment for China's survival. All citizens should be vigilant. However, the Japanese have been plotting against us for a long time. Since the Meiji Restoration, several decades have passed. During that time, they have reformed their politics, revitalized their industries, and strengthened their military. From top to bottom, they have done everything. Now, they have unleashed their accumulated strength to seize our rich territory as easily as taking something from a pocket. The major powers are watching with concern, but are helpless. The League of Nations is mediating, but they turn a deaf ear, relying on their strength and showing no fear. Their flames are especially fierce. China is a great nation with a vast territory of four million square miles, a population of 400 to 500 million, and abundant resources, the richest in the world. Why is it so weak that it cannot resist the invasion of the dwarfs? It is because the people are afraid of difficulties, seek ease, lack creativity, and lack the spirit of old fighters. This is why. In the past, Baden-Powell, who was stationed in South Africa, saw that the indigenous people of Africa used their own strength for everything they ate, wore, and did, and they had a spirit of hard work and struggle. So he took their way of life and created the Boy Scouts. Material civilization is improving day by day, with tall buildings and mansions, light furs and warm robes, and delicacies from land and sea. What place does not have them? But the Boy Scouts must build their own tents, live in remote wilderness, and hunt animals, wearing coarse clothes and carrying sticks. Is this contrary to the path of evolution? It is also to cultivate their spirit of enduring hardship, hard work, struggle, and creativity in preparation for serving the country and society. Only after a fierce wind do we know the strength of the grass; only after hardship do we see the spirit. This is why Boy Scout education is valued by all countries in the world. Today, the urgent task of our country is to recover the lost territory of the three northeastern provinces. However, there must be a way to recover the lost territory. Just shouting and complaining is of no help. In the past, King Goujian of Yue did not forget the shame of Kuaiji. He slept on brushwood and tasted gall, gathering strength and training for twenty years to defeat Wu. This Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School Boy Scout Grand Encampment lasts for three days, which is a short time. However, it is hoped that all boy scouts will uphold this spirit, never lose it, endure hardship, sacrifice, and struggle, study hard, and serve society. If we always keep in mind the great revenge, then with China's abundant natural resources and the strength of its people, the recovery of the lost territory can be expected soon. Let us all strive for it.</p>

<p>Remarkable Results in Yesterday's Final Practice</p>

Eight teams, such as Southwest, Jian En, Gonghua, Muir, Shanghai West A, Shanghai West B, Chenguang A, and Chenguang B, participated. Forty women joined the one-mile race, such as Liangjiang Zhuang Mingzhen, Luo Qiyun, and Chengguangzhi. Individuals such as Guo Lianni, Zhong Xiaoying, Wu Shiying, and Tan Xiaozhen are all strong. The intensity of the competition can be predicted. It is heard that the Chinese Walking Association, in order to carefully consider the participation of young children in the walking race, has specially listed the following eleven people below and asked them to report to the association in person after 5:00 p.m. today: Liu Xueming, Ni Pinru, Qiu Zhongxie, Er Guang, Zhu Qiliang, Liu Xueming, Tao Yongbao, Yu Zhixie, Shun Zongyu, Bian Zhisheng, and Pan Songmei. If there are still any referees who have not been properly invited, please fill in the forms as soon as possible today.

If they saw anyone who was not walking properly, they immediately warned and corrected them. They were also told to take the diagonal direction when turning corners and not to be bound by the road rules (to the left and right) when crossing the road.

<h3 id="e102">Jinan Defeats Yuyou <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Result: 3-0</p>
<p>More Than A Thousand Spectators</p>
<p>Yuyou's football team's unified defensive line is not undesirable. In the match against Donghua last week, although there was no dazzling offense, the unremitting defense prevented the Donghua forwards from getting their way. As a result, they were miserably defeated in the second half due to an injury to a defender. Yesterday, against Jinan, they again took this defensive line and worked hard to resist. Although Jinan is known for their bravery, they could not get their wish. In the first half, Jinan took the lead with one goal. The final score was 3-0. Although Yuyou lost, they are not to be trifled with.</p>
<p>First Half: The bell rang three times, signaling the start of the contest. Yuyou deployed against the wind, which was initially disadvantageous. Jinan roamed freely, and Yuyou's defenders were unable to cope. The goalkeeper's business flourished, sending and receiving balls without a moment's rest. He saved countless dangerous shots. After 30 minutes of melee, Jinan's left刘祖侃passed a ball from the baseline. At that time, Jinan's forwards were all being watched by Yuyou's defenders. Center庄世鸿rushed forward to assist and scored a goal.</p>
<p>Second Half: At the end of the first half, Jinan was leading 1-0. After a short break, the ball was often in front of Yuyou's goal, with no chance to cross the midline. Although Dong Xiaopei and Xi Qiaosheng made one or two solo penetrations into the opponent's territory, they ultimately lacked support and labored in vain. On Jinan's side, first铁和scored a goal in the chaos, and then罗海光scored another goal after receiving a pass from　潢寳之, making the score 3-0. After that, there were fleeting attacks back and forth, but nothing came of it. At that time, the north wind was howling and the clouds were gloomy. The golden gong sounded, and the game was over. More than a thousand football fans returned in disappointment. The lineups were as follows:</p>
<p>Jinan</p>
<p>杨寳淼 刘祖侃</p>
<p>顾尚  盘海光</p>
<p>谢全和 徐亚辉 陈镇和</p>

The original letter from Mr. Zhu Jingnong, Director of Education of Hunan Province, recommending the adoption of these two books by physical education teachers in schools, is recorded below (To whom it may concern: The two books "Theory and Methods of Primary School Physical Education" by Mr. Chen Kuisheng, and "Morning Exercises and Recess Exercises" co-authored with Mr. Jin Zhaojun, emphasize the connection between physical education and education, psychology, physiology, and other sciences, breaking the misconception of replacing physical education with gymnastics. Both theory and practice are extremely refined, truly representing the most insightful works of the two authors in the study of physical education. I hereby introduce them and hope that you will adopt them for reference. Zhu Jingnong, October 22nd, year 21).

<p>The most important aspects of this tactic are the bounce pass, quick scoring, agile decoy, and skillful turning, etc. This method is now widely used in the school playgrounds of Indiana, USA. It is often used as a strategy for attacking zone defenses and five-man zone defenses.</p>
<p>Number one rushes out from the corner of his own court, running towards the free-throw area. He receives a bounce pass from number four. Numbers three and five feint to move forward to the right front, but after attracting their defenders to the right, they turn and head to the left. Number five runs to the arc of the free-throw area and receives a pass from number one, then immediately passes it to number three, who is charging towards the basket. At this time, if number one's defender blocks number three, then number two can find a way to move forward to the basket to receive number three's pass.</p>

<p>Correcting the Malicious Propaganda of a Certain Japanese Official</p>
<p>National News Agency reports: Song Ziwen, Acting President of the Executive Yuan, stated to a reporter from the National News Agency yesterday that he doubts the truthfulness of a report that a certain responsible Japanese official told news reporters that there was a negotiation between China and Japan that was even more important than the Manchurian issue, but he didn't know where the Chinese government actually was or who was in charge. As far as he remembers, Japanese Minister Akira Ariyoshi had just presented his credentials to the National Government a few weeks ago. If the words of the Japanese official mentioned in the newspaper were true, it would be tantamount to disavowing his own minister, which would only confirm what American politician Frederick Moore said last winter: "(Any country that wants to establish treaty relations with Japan, for the sake of safety, should sign two treaties, one with its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and one with its General Staff)." Furthermore, Premier Wang Jingwei's trip to Hamburg, Europe for medical treatment was enough to cause rumors of a split in the National Government, but Wang has already made a frank statement, and his colleagues are still serving in the government as usual. It is hoped that outsiders will not ignore the facts and lightly believe the rumors. When the League of Nations convenes in the future, Premier Wang will go to Geneva to discuss countermeasures with the Chinese delegation, which will put an end to such slanders. Although the National Government has repeatedly encountered difficulties, such as the invasion of the Northeast and Shanghai, the great flood last autumn, and the worldwide economic depression, which have all had adverse effects, its power is becoming increasingly consolidated. This spring, as soon as the Japanese army withdraws from Shanghai, it will immediately engage in suppressing the communists, because the communist bandits took advantage of the Japanese invasion to commit acts of violence. At one point, the areas occupied in Anhui, Hubei, and Henan provinces reached 30,000 square miles. After six months of arduous suppression by the National Army, they have now been gradually recovered. The organized communist army has been completely defeated. Only sporadic remnants remain north of the Yangtze River, waiting to be eliminated. Military Affairs Committee Chairman Chiang is now moving a large army to Jiangxi to attack the communist party's main nest. As long as there is no more obstruction from the Japanese army, the communist suppression military operations will be completely concluded in the near future. Those engaging in reactionary propaganda claim that local conflicts in Shandong and Sichuan show that the government is gradually losing power and is a sign of its impending collapse. As a result, those who doubt the current situation may be poisoned by propaganda. In fact, these are all specious arguments. I also believe that the government's forbearance is proof of its growing power. When the Shenyang Incident suddenly occurred last September, I predicted that the era of civil war was coming to an end. In the past, if armed conflicts occurred between warlords, the central government would often issue strict orders to move troops to suppress them. Now, the government knows that unifying by force is both difficult and inappropriate, so it wants to implement moral sanctions and solve local disputes with the help of public opinion. At present, outstanding individuals in the country have organized the "Great Alliance to Abolish Civil War," and its power is growing stronger day by day, soon becoming an important force in abolishing the use of force to solve political problems. Therefore, the central government does not want to easily resort to military force, and will reserve its troops to resist foreign aggression and eliminate those who attempt to use violence to disrupt social order. Moreover, the government's adoption of a policy of forbearance has already yielded significant results. This summer's armed conflict in Guangzhou was therefore limited to one area and gradually subsided on its own. The recent dispute in Shandong province has also been stopped, and there is reason to believe that the turmoil in Sichuan can also be pacified without the use of force by the central government. Now that the people deeply hate civil war, the central government, by complying with public opinion, should see its foundation become more consolidated. Even from a negative perspective, the central government, after adopting a policy of forbearance, can save hundreds of millions in military spending, such as those spent on pacifying domestic rebellions in the past, and can also avoid the distraction of communist suppression military operations. Moreover, it can also begin to carry out construction plans. For example, the government, in the most difficult environment, has completed 2,000 kilometers of embankment along the Yangtze River, which can prevent the recurrence of last year's great flood. As for construction, those familiar with current affairs can see that the government's construction program is becoming increasingly substantial, no longer just empty talk, and has already begun to implement it. The plans it has drawn up must be immediately implementable and able to obtain foreign technical and financial assistance. For example, the Ministry of Railways has plans to complete the Guangdong-Hankou, Cangshi, and Longhai railways, and to reorganize existing railways. Other ministries, with the help of experts from the League of Nations, are also currently planning land rent, rural lending, mass education, central health laboratories, agricultural experiment stations, and expanding telegraphs and telephones, building national highways, and improving the silk industry. As for the government's finances, since the plan to change the domestic debt fund was successful, and the implementation of cutting government spending, and the recent rectification of tax policies, despite encountering unprecedented difficulties in the past nine months, such as the seizure of Northeast customs and salt taxes, it can still avoid raising a debt.</p>
<p>Although the painful cuts in government and military spending have indeed caused much suffering and hindered countless necessary advances, it is a remarkable fact that China is one of the few countries that can balance its budget without borrowing, at a time when very few countries in the world can do so. As the Western saying goes, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Recently, China's credit abroad has gradually increased and is now among the highest in the world. In the London market in the past twelve months, the post-war reconstruction loan of the Republic of China has risen from 61 to 73, the Anglo-German renewal debt has risen from 82 to 96, and the Anglo-French loan has risen from 50 to 75. Even domestically, the prices of domestic debt have gradually risen in recent months. The rise in the prices of government bonds at home and abroad shows the growing confidence of the outside world in it. This can be regarded as a touchstone for whether the government is stable or not. How can the rumors of those engaged in malicious propaganda be relied on as a tool to spy on the government?</p>
<h3 id="e115">Chen Gongbo Talks About the Central Steel Plant <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Fundraising methods have been decided</p>
<p>The development program has also been planned</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The establishment of the Central Steel Plant has been carefully planned by the Ministry of Industry for several months. The Sino-German contract has been largely agreed upon and will be signed soon. The location of the plant is still under study. Although the contents of the plan and the raising of capital have been recorded in various newspapers, most of them are fragmentary and not detailed. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Minister Chen at the National Trademark Bureau by appointment to inquire about everything in detail, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Signing of the Official Contract: The Sino-German contract has long been agreed upon. All the machinery and equipment required by the plant will be sold by Germany. However, we can send a specialized committee to inspect whether the purchased machines are excellent, and the specialist can compare their prices with those of products from the United Kingdom and the United States in detail to see if they are low. Only after everything is considered satisfactory will they be allowed to be shipped to China, configured, and applied. As for technical personnel, we are still lacking, so we also plan to have Germany select technicians to respond to our invitations and only provide technical assistance. Therefore, in the future, the Central Steel Plant will be a self-operated enterprise that our government must obtain. The date of signing the contract cannot proceed because the location of the plant has not been resolved. However, the German side has urged us many times, so I hope to resolve the location within a month, and then we can sign the contract at the beginning of next month. The Plant Site Is Undecided: The Ideal of Establishing a Steel Plant: The location should of course be an area with both coal and iron ore deposits, to take advantage of the convenience of obtaining raw materials and the low production costs. The Northeast of our country does have this kind of area. If it were in the South, it would lose the meaning of natural distribution, because our country's iron mines are all south of the Yangtze River, while coal mines are all distributed north of the Yangtze River. Therefore, the location of the steel plant is quite a consideration. Some have proposed setting it up in Pukou. The land and water transportation there is convenient, and it can become the hub of north-south industry and commerce in the future. Therefore, purely from an economic point of view, that place should be very suitable. Moreover, the land there is flat, making it easier and more time-saving to build factory buildings. However, if we want to consider the important meaning of national defense, then this place will inevitably be rejected. As for Ma'anshan, although a survey has been done once, it is still not a very safe place. Although the mountain is high, the neighboring peaks are very short. The Ministry of Military Affairs specially sent several military advisors to go by plane to conduct another aerial survey before a decision can be made. Therefore, I hope to be able to resolve this matter before the end of this month. Coal and Iron Raw Materials: The raw materials required by the steel plant are coal and iron. If we can be self-sufficient, the production cost can be reduced. Therefore, the Central Steel Plant will not only set up a steel plant, but will also mine both coal and iron mines. Anhui Province has abundant reserves of these raw materials. What has been decided now is the Lieshan coal mine and the Yihua and Yuhua iron mines. The Lieshan coal mine can yield 25 million tons of coal when mined to a depth of 1,000 feet. Therefore, in addition to supplying our own use, it can also be sold at a price. The pure content of the Yihua and Yuhua iron mines is 60%, which can continue to be mined for 20 years. Therefore, the steel plant has abundant raw materials. Unfortunately, the capital is limited and it is a new venture, so we cannot plan too big. Therefore, we are only using 80 million as the establishment fund, and the daily output of pure steel is only 500 tons, which is for 5% of our country's total consumption. If there is a surplus in the future, we will expand in order. The iron ore rich in the Dabie Mountains can be used for continued development. Establishment Expenses: The total funds for the steel plant are tentatively set at 80 million yuan, with 10 million yuan used for mining the Lieshan coal mine. 70% of the remaining 70 million yuan, i.e., 49 million yuan, will be used for building the plant site and machinery, and 30%, i.e., 21 million yuan, will be used for mining the Yihua and Yuhua iron mines. This is an estimate, and a precise calculation will be announced later.</p>
<p>Fundraising Methods: The above-mentioned equipment cost of 80 million yuan is difficult to raise at once due to the current financial difficulties of the country. Therefore, it has been decided to issue treasury bonds for half of it, i.e., 40 million yuan, which will be the responsibility of the Central Bank as marketable securities. To ensure credit, the Ministry of Finance will designate a portion of the national tax revenue as collateral. I have already discussed this with Minister Song and have received his approval. The remaining 40 million yuan will be borrowed by the Ministry of Industry with the guarantee of the Lieshan coal production. The Lieshan coal production is estimated at 25 million tons. At 10 yuan per ton, it would be worth 250 million yuan. Therefore, this guarantee is also very noteworthy. In this way, the huge sum of 80 million yuan will be shared by the financial and industrial sectors, making it easier to raise and bear.</p>
<p>Construction Date: If the Sino-German contract can be signed as scheduled, the ministry will send specialists to Germany to inspect the machinery so that it can be shipped to China. The round trip will take about two months. Therefore, three months after the signing of the contract, the first batch of machinery can arrive. If the plant site is set in Pukou, it will be easier to build houses on flat ground. Therefore, three months later, the factory building can also have a considerable scale. If it is set in Ma'anshan, the construction of the hillside will require a lot of work and may take a long time.</p>
<p>Discussing Setting Up a Paper Mill: After the reporter finished the interview and left, Lu Feibohong of Zhonghua Book Company, Wang Yunwu of Commercial Press, and others visited Minister Chen to discuss the establishment of a paper mill. However, no concrete decisions have been made, so it has not been announced. After finishing his work yesterday, Minister Chen took the night train back to Nanjing.</p>

<p>Occupying Gaoqiao and Lianshan in One Day</p>
<p>Far East News Agency reports: Mr. Yang Yijie, representative in Shanghai of the Fourth Route Headquarters of the Liaoning Volunteer Army, received a victory telegram from Geng Jizhou, commander of the route, yesterday stating: (Omitted above) Our army occupied Gaoqiao and Lianshan on the 1st of this month, killing more than 700 enemies. On the 2nd, we approached Jinzhou and engaged in fierce battles with more than 2,000 enemies day and night. Our army retreated slightly to the west. On the afternoon of the 3rd, Second Division Commander Chang Xihou was ordered to come to the rescue and attacked the enemy's east back. Our army immediately returned to attack the enemy guarding the station, stubbornly resisting behind fortifications. Our army vowed to fight to the death and capture Jinzhou within three days. We are still in fierce battle. We hope that you and your comrades will work hard and urgently request domestic aid to help the righteous army survive and not die of hunger and cold. Geng Jizhou's seal.</p>
<p>Faku and Zhangwu Puppet Police Revolt: Datong News Agency reports: Messrs. Yang Yijie and Cao Fengchun, representatives in Shanghai of the Fourth Route Headquarters of the Liaoning Volunteer Army, received a letter from Zhang Zhitian, staff officer of the route's office in Peiping, yesterday stating (omitted above): More than 20,000 puppet police officers from Faku and Zhangwu counties have now revolted and joined the army, under the command of our route's commander. In addition, about 2,000 people east of Tangshan are willing to join our route and will be organized into teams and sent out of the pass immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Wang Delin's Representative Reports the Capture of Ning'an <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Killing More Than 400 Japanese Military Guards</p>
<p>Intercepting More Than 400 Supply Vehicles</p>
<p>Burning 21 Trains of Enemy Gasoline</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association received a quick letter yesterday from Liang Yuanshan, representative of Wang Delin, commander-in-chief of the Jilin National Salvation Army, sent from Peiping. According to a report from Mr. Liu, a correspondent sent from Peiping to Suifenhe and East Ning'an to meet Commander Wang: (Omitted above) On September 29, the Japanese army departed from Changchun for Ning'an with more than 600 horse-drawn carts, all loaded with supplies, gunpowder, and other items. Our army, taking advantage of the darkness before dawn, led by Commander Wu Yicheng, intercepted the enemy army into three sections, killing more than 400 Japanese military guards. Our army suffered more than ten casualties. We intercepted more than 400 supply vehicles, more than 40 machine guns, more than 200 rifles, more than 100,000 rounds of ammunition, five mortars, and more than 200 shells. Our army immediately used these military weapons to attack the town of Tokyo and captured it on the 3rd. This battle was bloody, with our army suffering 50 casualties and the enemy suffering more than 100 casualties. On the 8th, Commander Kong Xianrong attacked the city of Ning'an but failed. On the 10th, 21 Japanese gasoline trains passed west of the Sarahezi station and were hit by our army using bullets, burning the gasoline with a huge flame, and finally completely destroying the road. All three Japanese supply trains and 15 wooden carts were also burned clean. It is estimated that more than 40 trains and one locomotive were burned in this battle, preventing the Japanese reinforcements from being supplied. Our army took advantage of the opportunity to capture the city of Ning'an on the 16th at dawn, led by Commander Kong Xianrong with more than 10,000 people. Enemy and our casualties were equal. Commander Wang now has an arsenal and clothing factory in East Ning'an, with 160 workers. Due to financial difficulties and a lack of bullets, it is impossible to develop. We earnestly hope for assistance to facilitate military operations. Recently, the relief association has successively had Feng Zhanhai's representative Zhao Zhuohua, Wang Delin's representative Liang Yuanshan, and Li Du Dingchao's representative Su Chun come to the meeting to report the situation at the front, expressing gratitude for the 20,000 yuan that the relief association has distributed separately, and hoping for continued assistance. The association believes that Jilin is located in the center of the three provinces and is the location of the puppet capital. The number of people in the three units of Li, Feng, and Wang is over 230,000, and they are very willing to provide as much assistance as possible to replenish the military supplies of each army. Due to the small amount of money, we deeply hope that compatriots from all over the country will enthusiastically donate to quickly recover the lost territory.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Jilin Representative Talks About the Recent Situation of the National Salvation Army <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Chuyu and Liang Detang Come to Shanghai to Beg for Assistance</p>
<p>Recently, Jilin National Salvation Army Commander-in-Chief sent representatives Zhang Chuyu and Liang Detang to Shanghai to report the recent anti-Japanese situation to all sectors and mass organizations and ask for assistance. A reporter from Huadong News Agency interviewed them at their residence yesterday and learned about the army's situation. According to them, Commander-in-Chief Wang took the lead in the uprising immediately after the Northeast Incident and joined forces with the militia to rise up against Japan. At first, the base was only in the four counties of Dongning, Wangqing, Muling, and Ning'an. Since the general offensive on August 8, in just 17 days, more than ten counties have been recovered, including Yanji, Hunchun, Helong, Dunhua, Emu, Shulan, Huaxun, Mengjiang, Antu, Tokyo City, and other counties. East of the Songhua River, it can be said that it is completely under the jurisdiction of this army. Commander-in-Chief Wang is still stationed in Dongning, Deputy Commander Kong Xianrong is stationed in Wangqing, Left Route Commander-in-Chief Wang Yuzhen is stationed in Hunchun, Right Route Commander-in-Chief Wu Yicheng is stationed in Tokyo City, and the Forward Command is located in Laoye Ridge, commanded by Wu Yicheng concurrently. The army has nine infantry brigades, and there are also four artillery regiments. The military equipment includes two field artillery pieces, more than 40 mortars, four flat-firing guns, more than 30 machine guns, and about 90,000 rifles. It is also said that the Harbin-Suifenhe line of the Chinese Eastern Railway has not yet been opened to traffic. The area from Suifenhe to Mudanjiang Station is under our army's martial law. From Mudanjiang to Hailin Station is the Japanese military's martial law area (but Hailin Station was captured by our army on the 29th of last month). From Hailin to Yanshi Station and Hengdaohezi is also under our army's martial law. From Hengdaohezi to Yimianpo, it is guarded by the bandit Wang Maosheng (i.e., Little Golden Dragon), who was appointed as the commander of the special operations team by Commander-in-Chief Wang, and is responsible for sabotage work. The front line of our army in the Chinese Eastern Railway is already at Gaolingzi, with a brigade stationed there. Our army also has more than 50,000 special operations teams in the area of Tuquan, Kangping, and Faku in Liaobei, which belong to the Zhilu Army headquarters and are now under the command of Cheng Qinglong, commander of the 12th Route, and Deputy Commanders Wu Lingsaxuan and Zhao Xian. The special operations teams in Andong, Fengshan, and Kuandian in Liaodong are under the command of Yang Fuhai, commander of the 11th Route. Commander Wang's headquarters has a guard of 8,000 men, all of whom are hunters, who can fight for the survival of the nation and never leave until death. They often say that attacking the enemy army is easier than hunting beasts, which is really admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Second Group of Volunteer Army Rescue Team Preparing to Depart <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>First Group Cables They Will Immediately Depart Jinxi</p>
<p>Western Medicine Sector Receives and Supports with Medicine</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Rescue Team has been established for nearly two months and has achieved remarkable results. Many young people from all walks of life have requested to join. Yesterday, Dr. Li Anbang, a medical doctor from the University of Hamburg in Germany, Huang Zhong, a graduate of the Nanyang Medical College and currently a physician at Renji Hospital, and Li Jinong, a student from Nanjing Jinling University, sent letters requesting to join the second group of the team to go north and carry out rescue work. The latest news about the team is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First Group to Immediately Depart Jinxi　　The first group of fifty team members departed Shanghai last month and arrived in Beiping, where they contacted various circles in Beiping to discuss matters related to crossing the border. Preparations have been completed and they will depart for Jinxi soon. The Shanghai office received a telegram from them yesterday, which stated (excerpt above): Xing (Jiang Yuyang, the leader of the first group) and others have made arrangements with Geng Jizhou, the commander of the Fourth Route Volunteer Army in western Liaoning, and will depart for Jinxi soon to carry out rescue work. However, all medicines are urgently needed and should be prepared quickly. This telegram is sent specifically for this purpose (excerpt below). The team also telegraphed General Zhu Ziqiao yesterday, stating (excerpt above): Our team, in view of the Northeast Volunteer Army's unwavering determination to fight to the death with the invading bandits, even at the cost of their own flesh and blood, and recognizing that even the bravest soldiers are inevitably wounded, has gathered patriotic volunteers from all walks of life to organize the Northeast Volunteer Army Rescue Team. The first group of team members departed Shanghai last month and came to Beiping, stationed in the official residence of Jia Dayi, and then went to the battlefield to carry out rescue work. Knowing that you, sir, are enthusiastic about patriotism and benevolent, we have sent this telegram in addition to a telegram to General Jian, and respectfully request your guidance nearby. The second group of team members has been organized and is awaiting the order to depart. Northeast Volunteer Army Rescue Team Shanghai Office, Fei Jian, Wu Huiquan bow.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Registration to Participate　　In recent days, young people from all walks of life have come to the team to register and request to participate in the anti-Japanese war in the north, with several cases every day. Therefore, the team has reached more than one hundred and eighty members. The day before yesterday, the team received a letter from Li Xuanbing of the Fourth Company of the First Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Shanghai Municipal Security Team, requesting to participate in the second group going north to fight against Japan. The letter contained hundreds of words, full of passionate language. It stated that he graduated from Wuchang Middle School and was unable to continue his studies due to family circumstances. He has been in the military for six years. During the January 28th Incident, he participated in the defense of Zhabei with the Sixth Regiment of the Military Police for six days and nights. Now serving in the security team, he felt deeply about the invasion by the brutal Japanese and specifically wrote to request to participate.</p>
<p>Negotiating and Providing Medicine　　In view of the first group of team members scheduled to cross the border to carry out rescue work, the team sent representatives to the Shanghai Western Medicine Trade Association yesterday to negotiate the provision of medicine. Because the association had promised before the departure of the first group that it would send a large number of rescue medicines for use after the first group arrived in Beiping, the association has already discussed the issue of medicine supply with pharmacies yesterday, and it is expected that a large amount of medicine will be sent in the next few days.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Assistance from All Walks of Life　　Since the first group of team members went north, assistance from all walks of life has become even more enthusiastic. The National Disaster Soldiers' Relief Association has moved all of its accumulated iron beds and medicines to help the team. Donations from all walks of life have also been collected by the Industrial Bank of China and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank. Those who directly donated to the team's donation department include Wan Zhenxin, Yongchang Timber Company, Fuji (each donating two yuan), Nanchengxin, Yuanyuan, Tongshenfeng, Yikang, Fuxingtai, Yao Jun, Jiu Heyong, Jiechun, Sheng Taichang, Yuan Taichang, Hongchang Xiji, Run Chang Hongji, Zhu Cunde, Wan Yuanzhang, Shenli, Changji, Zhuangyuanlou, Yao Shenlong, Ding Yu Rice Mill, Zhang Genyang, Zhou Shiwei, Xu Jingbin, Guohua Zongji, Fuxing Quan, Yu Taishun, Yao Yilong, Yong Yuan, Ding Taichang, Jusheng, Wan Longtai, Tongchang, Xi Sentai, Wan Zhen Zhao Ji (each donating one yuan), Tongxingchang, Zhu Shunxing, Shen Hexiang, Wanxin, Yu Taifeng, Huashunmao, Yukang, Xiangji, Wanchengxiang Tong Hengchun Yuelai Xin, Zhang Jun, Jin Gonghe, Xinghe, Song Jun (each donating five jiao).

<p>Response to Citizen Wang Zibin's Question</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Zibin, a citizen of this city, deeply felt that although the Northeast Volunteer Army was fighting hard, it was difficult to endure hunger and cold in the snowy and icy weather. He specifically wrote to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, expressing his willingness to donate cotton clothing for the volunteer army and asking about the style. The association replied yesterday, stating: Regarding your letter, we are aware that you are concerned about the Volunteer Army's thin clothing, making it difficult to withstand the severe cold, and plan to donate and manufacture assistance. We appreciate your inquiry about the style, what kind of colored cloth is needed, and whether the finished product can be handed over to our association for transportation to the front lines. It has now been decided at the standing committee meeting that the cotton clothing should be long enough to reach the knees, the cotton batting should be thick, the cloth should be light gray, and the finished product can be handed over to our association for transportation. We are sending this letter in response.</p>

<p>Departing by Train Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeast Refugees received a telegram from its representatives going north, Qu Wenliu and Feng Yangshan, which stated (excerpt above): (Northeast relief work can now be carried out actively. Fen has decided to cross the border immediately. Mr. Qian Junren of the Dong Province Flood Relief Conference has come to welcome us in person, so we can travel without obstruction. Please ask Mr. Cui Xianlou to bring the list of relief friends, and take the train to Tianjin on a scheduled date, to Mr. Yu Guisheng of Huatai Foreign Firm on Hai Avenue, and follow Fen. The food, lodging, and travel expenses of the relief friends should be paid as per the previous letter. In addition to remitting 20,000 yuan to Ping to set up a porridge factory, the remaining funds should be remitted in equal halves to Changchun and Harbin for Fen's use, as cotton clothing needs to be made in Changchun. When will Cui and others depart, and which bank will remit the relief funds? Please reply by telegram. Guang awaits Fen's arrival, and will return to Shanghai after the porridge factory is prepared. There is no need to prepare flags or armbands. Qu Yingguang and Feng Xuefen bow.) After receiving the telegram, the association has sent letters to the eight organizations in the joint organization, urging them to advance the funds, and urged Mr. Cui Xianlou to go north immediately. It is also heard that Mr. Cui has scheduled to depart by train this afternoon to join Mr. Feng in crossing the border.</p>

<p>According to Huadong News Agency, on the evening of the 2nd of this month at 11:30 PM, the Shanghai Southwest Eight Provinces Volunteer Allied Army Preparatory Committee was suddenly raided by the French police, and Liu Jue, the director of the committee, was arrested. It was not until 8 PM on the 3rd that Liu was bailed out by his friends Xia Qifeng, Gan Jiehou, Zhang Dingfan, and Wei Shizhao. The committee specifically sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, reporting the matter in detail and requesting a serious protest. The original telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs　　Nanjing Minister Luo Xunjian, our office in Shanghai was suddenly raided by the French police on the winter day of this month, and several secret telegram books, an English cipher book from the Chinese Embassy in Paris, a purchase order for military supplies from the Hong Kong Swiss Foreign Firm, a general review of the failed operations against the brutal Japanese Empire to be submitted to the General Staff, an outline of the military committee's troop deployment plan to the Central Government (20 pages), a book on the Chinese coastline issue, a short-term deposit slip from the Shanghai Bank, a savings certificate in Liu Jue's name from the Beiping Dalu Bank, several pocket-sized checks, and important official documents and telegrams were confiscated. Liu Jue, the director of our preparatory committee, was arrested and put in shackles. In the evening of the same day, Xia Qifeng, Gan Jiehou, Zhang Dingfan, and Wei Shizhao bailed him out. In addition to sending him to the hospital for treatment, we earnestly request that the ministry lodge a serious protest. We are saddened by this telegram and await your orders.

<h3 id="e126">Nan Gongmao Yarn Shop Warned for Selling Unlicensed Yarn <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Nan Gongmao Yarn Shop, located at the Wan Yu Wharf in Nanshi, this city, suddenly received a warning letter from the Iron Blood Elimination Corps the day before yesterday. The owner of the shop, Tang Zhiliang, is the chairman of the Buddhist yarn market. The corps also sent a letter to the reporter of the Xin Sheng News Agency on Wangping Street in this city, asking to distribute the news to various newspapers. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Warning Letter from the Elimination Corps The Iron Blood Elimination Corps sent a letter to the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, stating: Our corps recently discovered that Nan Gongmao Yarn Shop at Wan Yu Wharf is selling Japanese yarn, profiting from the country's misfortune. At this time of intense anti-Japanese sentiment, there are still shameless merchants, which is extremely hateful. We are sending a warning letter to the shop, copied below. Please publish it in major newspapers on behalf of our agency to warn against such behavior and prevent others from imitating it. We believe that your agency is a patriotic organization and will definitely help our corps. The letter is enclosed below: Dear Sir, We recently learned from members of our corps that your shop is selling unlicensed sixteen-count Japanese yarn, which has been found along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. At this time of intense anti-Japanese sentiment, such shameless behavior is extremely heartbreaking. We are ordering you to stop selling it immediately, otherwise you will face unfavorable bombs and bullets. Sincerely, Tang Zhiliang, Nan Gongmao Yarn Shop. Iron Blood Elimination Corps.</p>
<p>Talk from Nan Gongmao Shop After receiving the letter, the reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Tang Zhiliang, the chairman of the cotton yarn market. Mr. Tang was away from Shanghai on business, so the reporter went to Nan Gongmao Yarn Shop to inquire. According to the spokesperson of the shop, they have cleared out Japanese goods and stopped selling them since June of last year, and have never purchased Japanese goods since January 28th. The Iron Blood Elimination Corps may have made a mistake in their investigation. However, according to an unofficial report from someone in the cotton yarn industry, the shop has sold unlicensed sixteen-count yarn in the past few days, and its price is lower than that of domestic goods, with the normal price being one hundred and forty taels per piece, while the shop only charges one hundred and thirty taels.</p>

<p>Tang Hai'an, the superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Luo Fude, the commissioner of taxation, issued a joint notice yesterday, which stated: Regarding the joint notice, the number of consular visas issued by the consulates of the Republic of China abroad and the amount of visa fees paid have been announced on August 18, August 22, September 19, October 19, and November 1 of this year. Item (b) in the announcement of August 22 has now been changed by order of the government to: For goods shipped from overseas in November and December of the 21st year of the Republic of China that do not have a consular visa, the consignee shall pay a visa fee of five customs gold units to the customs to reissue the visa, without having to pay ten customs gold units. Item (c) shall still be handled as before. We should comply with this order, and all merchants should be informed. This notice is issued specifically.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Japanese Vice Admiral Saito Will Inspect Our Yangtze River with Itano <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Vice Admiral Saito, who was ordered by the Japanese Naval Ministry to come to China to inspect the Chinese navy and to decide on a liaison plan between the Second and Third Fleets, has been in Shanghai since the 4th, holding talks with Sakonji, Sugisaka, and Sakano. However, since Sakonji has been ordered to transfer to Sasebo and the newly appointed commander of the Third Fleet, Takahashi, has not yet come to China to take office, a formal decision cannot yet be made. Since Takahashi's arrival in China will take some time, Saito decided to take this opportunity to depart on the morning of the 9th to inspect the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in our country. Itano, the commander of the First Overseas Dispatch Team, will accompany him.</p>
<h3 id="e129">A Large Batch of Silver Dollars from the Bank of China and Others Transported to the Northeast <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>For the Use of Supplying Various Branches</p>
<p>According to Guo Yue News Agency, since the establishment of the puppet state under the wings of the Japanese, it has seized our customs duties and postal and telecommunications services. Financially, there has never been a single cash inflow into the Guannei, so all trade in our country is no longer as active as before, and a large batch of silver dollars has not been transported to the Northeast. Recently, the Bank of China and other banks have transported some, which was handed over to Dongshunji on Jixiang Street, Yishunheng on Jiangxi Road, and Er Customs Brokerage in this city for customs clearance, and transported by Butterfield &amp; Swire's Northern Shipping Line to Dalian Yingkou, then transferred to the South Manchuria Railway to Shenchang. The details obtained by reporters from various parties yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A Total of Three Batches Transported　　Reporters inquired with the two shipping and customs brokerage firms yesterday and learned that a total of three batches were shipped by the Bank of China and several other banks. The first batch was seventy boxes, the second batch was twenty boxes, and the third batch was shipped out the day before yesterday (the 5th), totaling one hundred and five boxes. Each box contained 5,000 yuan, totaling about one million yuan.</p>
<p>Bei Songsun's Talk　　Subsequently, the reporter telephoned Bei Songsun, the manager of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, to inquire. According to his talk, although the branches in the Northeast provinces are under the puppet government, they continue to operate as usual for business and to maintain credit relations. Regarding the so-called large batch of silver dollars transported to the Northeast, according to my knowledge, the amount is only several hundred thousand, and not as much as one million. In short, this matter is purely for business and has no other purpose.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou's Opinion　　According to Lin Kanghou's opinion from the Banking Association, the transport of silver to the Northeast is not surprising, as the branches of each bank in the Dong Province have to circulate silver to maintain business. Currently, the Dong Province banks are still operating as usual. If the puppet state causes damage and the branches stop operating, the bank depositors should also be refunded in cash.</p>

<p>Luo Jing and Jiang Jizhong from the Yangtze River News Agency, in order to follow the late Premier's legacy of developing the Northwest, organized the Northwest Development Association in Wuhan in the 18th year of the Republic of China, and in the 19th year, Liu Zhilian and others from Gansu went to various provinces in Gansu and Xinjiang to organize branch associations, in order to broadly recruit talents and jointly seek progress. When the association's inspection team went to the Northwest for inspection last year, it appointed fifteen cadres to be responsible for sorting out, expanding, and soliciting. In order to concentrate opinions, improve association affairs, and make contributions to the central government and the people of the country, the first cadre annual meeting was convened in Shanghai yesterday at the association's Shanghai communication office on Xiafei Road. Attendees included Liu Zhidao, An Bangjie, Lv Lei, Yang Wanxiong, Kangzang district representatives Geller Bigge, He Jiazeni (transliteration), Suimeng district representatives Guo Daolong, Qiang Zhenya, Geermujie, Yangtze River district representatives Jiang Jizhong and Zhang Gang, and Luo Jing, who was in charge of the Beijing office, totaling more than ten people. Around 2 PM, the representatives gathered in the auditorium, performed the rituals, and began the meeting. Geermujie was elected as the temporary chairman, Zhang Gang and Jiang Jizhong as the recorders, and Qiang Zhenya as the translator. The chairman first reported on the significance of the meeting, followed by Luo Jing reporting on the situation of contacting various important figures in the central government in Beijing. The representatives then reported on the situation of the branch associations in their respective districts, submitted membership lists, and proposed several motions, which were discussed on the spot. It was resolved that the attending representatives would form groups to review each other, and the decision would be discussed at the next meeting. It is heard that the meeting period is tentatively set for five days. After the meeting is completed, the Shanghai press will be invited to report on the preparations for developing the Northwest and the future plans, and to ask for guidance and promotion. They will also go to the capital to visit the mausoleum of the Premier and report to the central government agencies for their consideration.</p>

<p>Urging the Municipal Government to Further Press Foreign Merchants to Issue Public Bonds</p>
<p>The Fire Insurance Claims Coordination Association of Disaster Areas convened a meeting of the entire Claims Committee yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. Hu Yibo, Mou Yuehe, Wang Weigong, Tang Youwei, and over twenty others attended. Mou Yueqiu was elected as chairman. He reported on the recent progress of the work and the sympathy expressed by the Social Affairs Bureau towards the association. He also noted that recently, many shops and residents in the city have been insuring with Chinese merchants because Chinese merchants have accepted the issuance of public bonds, while foreign merchants have yet to express any interest. As a result, the business of foreign merchants is declining, indicating that foreign merchants are disregarding commercial credit. Following the report, the following matters were discussed: (1) The association will send a letter to foreign merchants, setting a deadline for them to respond with compensation plans. Otherwise, the association will hand the matter over to the extraordinary shareholders for claim processing. This was approved. (2) A further request will be submitted to the municipal government to urge foreign merchants to handle the matter in a consistent manner with Chinese merchants.</p>

<p>Allowing Them to Supplement Registration and Build Huts for Residence</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, we have recently received reports from the puddle neighborhoods on various roads in Yangshupu, stating that your department is demolishing all thatched huts in the area that have not been registered, and even extending to registered huts, destroying all pigpens and furniture. They have requested assistance. Upon investigation, it has been found that these puddle neighborhoods are mostly inhabited by famine refugees and laborers who, due to the high cost of rent in the city, have built their own thatched huts for residence, which is a last resort. Since your department has a precedent of allowing registered residents to live in their huts, those who have not registered are merely lacking in formalities. We request that your department allow them to supplement their registration and continue to build and reside in their huts. Registered residents should especially be legally protected to avoid harassment. Your department should also, within the scope of possibility, provide residential protection for poor residents within the concession to ensure equal treatment. This is what our association hopes for."</p>

<h3 id="e137">Chief Justice Zhou Xianjue of the First Special Court Resigns <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Approved by the Ministry of Judicial Administration</p>
<p>Guo Yunguan Appointed by the Ministry to Take Over the Vacancy</p>
<p>Zhou Xianjue, the Chief Justice of the Shanghai First Special District Court, due to his intention to retire, petitioned the Ministry of Judicial Administration for resignation. Minister Luo approved it, and Guo Yunguan was appointed by the Ministry to take over the vacancy. Chief Justice Zhou received the telegram a few days ago, and even though it was Saturday, he immediately instructed the staff of each department to begin handling the closing matters, so that he could hand over the position as soon as the new Chief Justice arrived in Shanghai. According to reports, Zhou was originally appointed by the Jiangsu Provincial Government in the 16th year of the Republic of China when the National Revolutionary Army recovered Jiangsu, and came with Lu Xingyuan, who was appointed as the Provisional Court Chief Justice. He initially served as a judge in the Criminal Court, then as a Presiding Judge. When the Provisional Court was reorganized into the Shanghai Special District Court and the Procuratorate was established, he was appointed as the first Chief Prosecutor. It was not until January 25th of this year that he succeeded Yang Hua熉 as Chief Justice. However, only three days after taking office, the January 28th Incident suddenly occurred. The court was adjacent to the Zhabei war zone, and the sounds of gunfire were clearly audible. In addition, Japanese planes flying to the northwest to drop bombs passed directly over the court. During this critical period, Zhou led all the judges and staff of the court to work extra hard and remain calm. Therefore, even though the Shanghai war lasted for more than a month, there was no backlog of civil or criminal cases in the court. In cases where the parties involved in the litigation had fled due to the war and their addresses were unknown, preventing the trial from proceeding, he supervised the clearing of the cases as soon as the war stopped, to ensure that no cases were left pending. In peacetime, he was determined to reorganize the court's affairs and eliminate long-standing malpractices, sparing no effort. He truly deserves to be called a conscientious official.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Hu Yigu Does Not Wish to Transfer <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Submits Resignation to the Ministry</p>
<p>Hu Yigu, the Presiding Judge of the Civil Division of the Jiangsu High Court, has been in his current position since the establishment of the Rental Court of Appeals at the same time as the reorganization of the Provisional Court after the recovery of the Mixed Court. In the past six years, the name of the court has changed twice, and the chief justice has changed four times, but Mr. Hu has never been transferred. Although he was once temporarily assigned by the Ministry to assume the duties of chief justice, he declined due to his modesty. Recently, the Ministry of Justice issued an order to transfer Hu to serve as the Chief Prosecutor of a certain court in Shandong Province, which seemed to be a promotion. However, it is heard that Mr. Hu is determined to retire due to his age and has declined the appointment. As for his duties in the Second Branch of the High Court, he will hand them over as soon as a replacement is found. It is noted that among the judges in the Public Concession since China established courts there, Mr. Hu is the longest-serving.</p>

<p>Merger Must Wait Until the New Chief Justice Takes Office</p>
<p>The accounting matters of the First Special District Court have always been supervised by the Chief Justice of the court and are not subject to the control of the Second Branch of the High Court, which is located in the same place. This system has been in place for many years. Last month, the Ministry of Judicial Administration issued instructions to the two branches of the High Court in the city, the Second and Third Branches, to change the original system. All accounting of the District Court should be merged with the accounting of the High Court and supervised by the Chief Justice of the High Court. It is heard that the Second Special Court in the French Concession has followed the ministerial order and reorganized the accounting department, and has already transferred jurisdiction. Since the situation of the First Special Court is the same, it should also comply. Chief Justice Zhou Xianjue has repeatedly consulted with Shen Jiayi, the Chief Justice of the Second Branch of the High Court, regarding the merger procedures. It is heard that the overall situation has been completed and only needs to be implemented on a scheduled basis. Now, Chief Justice Zhou has suddenly resigned and the ministerial order for his dismissal has been approved. Therefore, the merger of the accounting departments of the two courts must be implemented after the new Chief Justice Guo takes office.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Large-Scale Scam: Fictitious Bank Set Up <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Banknotes Issued Freely, No Money Upon Maturity</p>
<p>Meager Interior, Only a Tea Server</p>
<p>Purchase of Gold Leaf Reveals the Truth</p>
<p>Number of Victims Likely Not Small</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, two customers suddenly came to a gold leaf workshop at No. 125 Fuyou Road in the South City, intending to use forged banknotes to swindle gold leaf. Someone noticed and handed them over to the Second Precinct of the First District. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that this was one of a large-scale scam. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Forged Notes Issued Successively: On the 6th of last month, a certain Zhuang suddenly opened a "Ding Yuan Tai Ji Bank" at No. 8, Jingjiang Lane, Tianzhutang Street, Xinbei. He successively issued a large number of forged notes, secretly instructing his accomplices to use them to purchase a large quantity of goods from major merchants. He then secretly sold the goods. The dates on most of the forged notes were listed as the 6th of this month.</p>
<p>Only a Tea Server Inside: Yesterday, when the maturity dates of the notes arrived, various merchants went to the address to redeem them. However, upon arriving at No. 8 Jingjiang Lane, they saw that the so-called Ding Yuan Bank had only a few desks inside. A young man who looked like a tea servant was inside. When asked his name, he said it was Chen Yongda. The merchants told him they were there to redeem the money. Chen replied that they had to wait for the manager to return. Everyone waited until evening, but there was no news.</p>
<p>Tea Server Only There for Two Days: At this point, the merchants realized that it was a fictitious bank issuing forged notes to obtain goods. They detained Chen Yongda and questioned his background. He claimed that he had previously worked as a tea server at the Ancient and Modern Troupe comedy theater in the New World, and was introduced to this bank by a tourist named Wang. He had only been there for two days and knew nothing about the internal affairs. At that time, each defrauded merchant also specially sent people to guard until 7 PM, still no way, Purchasing Gold Leaf Revealed the Truth:</p>
<p>At the same time, at a gold leaf workshop at No. 125 Fuyou Road in the city, two unexpected customers suddenly came to purchase gold leaf worth over 100 yuan. The two produced a Ding Yuan bank note, falsely worth 250 yuan, and asked the workshop to find change. The workshop happened to have no cash, so they asked them to wait. They immediately sent a shop assistant named Chen Renshan from Shaoxing to the address to verify. Chen arrived at the bank and found out the truth. He immediately returned to the workshop and, together with police officer No. 21 from the precinct, brought the two men and the forged note to the Second Precinct of the First District.</p>
<p>Customers Shift Blame: During the preliminary interrogation by the station chief, Chen Renshan complained about the incident and claimed that the two customers were using fraudulent bank notes to swindle goods, requesting a thorough investigation. When questioned, one customer gave his name as Xu Guang　, 36 years old, from Haimen, who operated a lacquer workshop at No. 11 Lafayette Road in the French Concession. The other customer gave his name as Cai Atao, 35 years old, from the same hometown and in the same industry as Xu. Both claimed that they had received the fraudulent bank note from a customer. They were ordered to stay for investigation and verification.</p>
<p>Many Others Likely Defrauded: Upon investigation, the house where the bank was located belonged to the church. Zhuang rented it from the second landlord, Fuyuan Paper Sundries Store, a month ago to set up this scam. To date, there is no lease contract. According to people at Fuyuan Store, they know nothing about Zhuang's background. In total, there have been two households found defrauded, one is the Xingda Silk Shop on Wuxi Road was defrauded of silk worth more than 800 yuan, one is the Wan Lun Silk Shop in Xiangfen Lane, defrauded of silk worth more than 100 yuan, they are have received a useless bank note in return, As for those who have not shown up, according to the bank note numbers they have issued, it is thought there are still many,</p>
<h3 id="e144">Money Stall on Tongzhou Road Robbed Yesterday Morning <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Robber Exceptionally Ferocious</p>
<p>Captured Twice, Escaped Twice</p>
<p>Finally Arrested Due to Injury</p>
<p>Russian Man Brave to the End</p>
<p>｜Detective Zhu Jiantang Shot and Killed by Robber｜</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:45 AM, a robbery occurred at the money stall on Tongzhou Road, resulting in the shooting and death of a detective. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Robber Targets Money Stall: There is a money stall in the Tongzhou Road vegetable market, set up by Wu Zhihao from Zhenjiang, dedicated to exchanging money for the morning market, in order to make a small profit. Yesterday morning at 10:45 AM, just as the market was bustling with activity, the stall was suddenly targeted by a robber wearing a blue short-sleeved shirt and pants. The robber held a pistol in his right hand, approached the money stall, and immediately ordered everyone to be quiet. He grabbed the 138.2 yuan in silver dollars on the stall and stuffed it into his pocket, then turned and fled. Wu Zhihao immediately chased after him, shouting "Robber!" People from nearby vegetable stalls, upon hearing the alarm, also helped to chase after him, about six or seven people, the robber saw behind him tightly after, that would flee to Xinji Bang Road,</p>
<p>Russian Man Intervenes: At the corner where Xinji Bang Road turns, there is a Dongxingji copperware shop. At that time, a Russian architect named Ailes was transacting inside. Upon hearing the sound of catching a robber coming from the Tongzhou Road area, he went outside to watch. He saw a short-clothed man running towards him, looking flustered, and someone chasing closely behind him. He knew that the former must be the robber. So he remained calm, and when the robber ran close to him, he stepped forward and grabbed him. Unexpectedly, the robber was very strong and broke free. Ailes grabbed his left hand. The robber, in desperation, quickly pulled out a pistol from his right pocket and fired at Ailes. Ailes immediately released his hand and dodged behind his own car. The robber escaped and ran forward again wildly.</p>
<p>Ferocious Robber Escapes Twice: After running about ten yards, Ailes came out from behind the car and, seeing the situation, quickly chased after him. The robber turned into Zhoujiazui Road, but Ailes still chased closely. The robber panicked and ran into the right lane of Hexin Lane. The lane employed two Chinese police officers, No. 1874 and No. 3322, as gatekeepers. At the same time, a man named Zhu Jiantang, who worked as a detective at the Old Gate Police Station, happened to live in the lane. When the robber ran in, Zhu happened to be carrying his young child out of the gate. Seeing this situation, he knew that something was wrong, so he quickly put his son down on the ground and met the robber head-on, hugging him around the waist. However, the robber managed to break free with both hands. Zhu then grabbed his left hand. The robber quickly pulled out the pistol from his pocket with his right hand, and Zhu also quickly drew his gun from his arms. The robber took the opportunity to fire four shots at Zhu's hands and feet. Zhu felt intense pain, and his left wrist lost strength. Therefore, the robber escaped again and turned back to shoot Zhu in the face. He was shot in the mouth, and the bullet exited from the back. Zhu fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Detective Dies, Robber Captured: At this time, Chinese police officer No. 1874 quickly fired three shots at the robber, all hitting vital spots. The robber also fell to the ground. Ailes also chased into the lane and, seeing the situation, put his right foot on the robber's body, took the pistol, and searched the robber's body for the stolen goods. At the same time, another police officer, No. 3322, also arrived and quickly reported to the police station. When the patrol police arrived, Zhu had already died from his serious injuries. His body was sent to the coroner's office. The robber was sent to the patrol police hospital, to be sent to the court after he recovered from his injuries. Ailes and others went to the police station to report the incident, signed their names, and left. Zhu Jiantang suffered a total of five injuries: one gunshot wound to the left leg, one to the left foot, one to the right wrist, one to the right leg, and one to the mouth. The robber was shot by the police officer in the left leg, left arm, and back, with severe injuries.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Brick and Ash Industry Tooth Tax Still Receiving One Post <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Approves</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Brick and Ash Industry Guild of this city, requested the Ministry of Finance to order the Shanghai Tooth Post Collection Office to waive the separate collection of two posts. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has approved the request. The original text states: "To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Regarding the Shanghai Tooth Tax Collection Office's separate collection of two posts for brick and ash merchants, the Chamber has telegraphed a request for legal rectification. Before the brick and ash industry's business tax is revised, the original amount should still be collected as one case. The Chamber has already sincerely requested the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to investigate and reply, and the Chamber has been notified of the instructions. According to Consultation No. 1607 of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance reported that the tooth post tax is specifically for those who open businesses with posts, act as agents for buying and selling, and extract commissions. The business tax is levied based on direct business activities. The nature of the two is different, and there is no duplication. As for the Brick and Ash Industry Guild's claim that the Shanghai Tooth Tax Collection Office requires brick and ash merchants to separately collect two posts, the Jiangsu Province's Reorganization of Tooth Tax Regulations, Goods Items, etc., stipulates two types of businesses: brick and tile businesses and lime businesses. The revenue from this tooth tax has long been allocated to educational expenses. It is unclear how the county's brick, tile, and lime businesses have applied for tooth posts over the years and how this year's situation is being handled. This department has no records available." After the Shanghai County Finance Bureau was ordered to investigate and reply, the director of the bureau, Wang Hua, replied, stating, "The Shanghai brick and ash tooth industry has jointly applied for one post since the Republic of China. Later, due to inconsistencies with the regulations for re-determining the tooth tax regulations and the amount of the goods item table, the bureau ordered separate applications. However, the guild repeatedly stated that business was difficult and they could not bear the increased burden, requesting that the old method be followed." The old method of joint application was approved during the tenure of former County Magistrate Lu, and in July of the 18th year, Instruction No. 1340 of the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office stated, "It is understood that brick and ash are related, and it is claimed that business has been sluggish recently. It is tentatively approved to temporarily allow joint application for one post to show consideration." Two original telegrams were re-examined due to competition from concrete bricks and cement, and business is far from what it used to be. The claim that brick and ash are the same item with the same nature is compared to the fish drying industry not separating fish, crabs, and shrimp and only collecting one post. It is not without reason. Since the brick and ash industry post has already been approved by the Education Funding Management Office to jointly apply for one post, and at a time when the brick and ash business is declining, it seems appropriate to continue to handle it as before to show consideration. The Ministry of Finance will be notified.</p>

Mr. Zhang Yingchao painted an ink chrysanthemum, and there were many other calligraphy works, a dazzling array of beauty. Photographers from various newspapers photographed the chrysanthemums, and painters sketched them, creating an endless stream. Until after 5 o'clock, when the ferries were about to stop, visitors were still reluctant to leave. Moreover, those who traveled back and forth across the Huangpu River yesterday braved the wind and waves, showing a heroic interest and a sincere love for chrysanthemums, which is truly a good phenomenon in China's garden circles. The organizers also presented all visitors with the Shanghai Chrysanthemum Exhibition Special Issue, the Garden Situation, the Agricultural Experiment Site Overview, and various other publications such as the Gardening Monthly as souvenirs.</p>

It detonated instantly, causing a loud explosion and black smoke to fill the sky. Shell fragments scattered everywhere, creating a large hole in the ground. Fortunately, no one was nearby, so no casualties occurred. Patrol Officer Tong Boya of the 1st Precinct of the 7th District heard about it and immediately took Patrol Officer Zhou Heshan to the scene for inspection. They also recovered a damaged shell casing. The patrol officer, because the factory is operated by Japanese merchants, and the Sino-Japanese dispute has not yet subsided, feared that there might be other reasons and that they might make excuses. Therefore, he had to find out the truth. After investigating everywhere and confirming that there were no other circumstances, he only took the damaged shell casing back to the station to report.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Water Outage at Longji Lane Resolved <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association has received a reply from the Municipal Council regarding the water supply to Longji Lane, North Zhejiang Road, which was cut off by the water company, causing a dispute. The matter has been resolved. The letters are recorded as follows: (1) Shanghai Real Estate Association to the General Office of the Public Concession Municipal Council, (November 4, 21st year): Sir, with reference to your office's response No. 1408 on October 27th, stating that the water source in Longji Lane has been restored, and enclosing a copy of the Shanghai Waterworks Co.'s reply, we have read it with respect. This kind of event, which could easily cause a major dispute, has been peacefully corrected, which is truly commendable and intelligent behavior on the part of the water company. The association anticipates that if a solution is sought from the perspective of both law and fact, a satisfactory resolution will be achieved. However, with regard to your office's inquiry to the association, asking whether it is fair and reasonable to continue not paying the arrears, the association can frankly answer that if the arrears arise from a dispute between the two parties, it is absolutely not fair and reasonable. Your office, we trust, will agree. Furthermore, regarding whether the water company's actions are oppressive to the association, after reading the draft letter from Longzhang Co. to the water company, we can draw a conclusion. (2) Public Concession Municipal Council replying to the Shanghai Real Estate Association, (October 28th): We acknowledge your major letter of October 25th, protesting the water outage in Longji Lane. Upon receiving the information, this bureau immediately inquired with the Shanghai Waterworks Co. Now, we present the reasons given by the company for your perusal. After reviewing them, we would like to ask whether you still consider the company's actions to be oppressive. Before the meter system was implemented, the houses in that area owed a total of 1,503.31 yuan in water fees from April to September. This issue has now been resolved. However, since your association has protested, we ask whether you consider it fair and reasonable to continue not paying the arrears. We hereby reply in this regard for your information. (3) Waterworks Co. to the Municipal Council, in response to your telephone inquiry to our general manager regarding the water supply at 716 and 717 North Zhejiang Road: The houses there are the property of Longzhang Co. The details of this incident are as follows: (1) On November 18th of last year, it was discovered that there was a rubber hose at 743 and 745 North Zhejiang Road, Yuda Dyeing Factory, connected to the water at 738 for dyeing purposes. According to the tenant of the house, it was one of the owners of the dyeing factory. (2) On the 23rd of the same month, our company informed Longzhang Co. of this matter and stated that in order to prevent water theft, the houses there would be charged according to water meter rates. (3) After sending the letter, there was no response. On January 6th of this year, another letter was sent, but because the landlord did not take any action, the water supply was cut off. As a result, a water meter contract was signed on the 15th. (4) For various reasons, the water meter readings totaled 1,503.31 yuan. (5) After March of this year, the dyeing factory's water fees gradually increased to twice the previous amount, proving that there was indeed water theft before. (6) The landlord refused to pay the fees. Our company issued a notice on October 13th and informed the tenants. The landlord, in addition to requesting that fees be charged according to the old system, had no other way to satisfy our company. Therefore, the water supply was cut off on the 24th. (7) The entire area where the houses are located began to install water meters on October 1st. (8) A representative from this company came to agree to discount the water fees for the entire period, which would resolve the matter immediately. This was because the landlord had difficulty preventing water theft. However, if the landlord had taken action promptly after receiving our company's notice last December, it would have satisfied the dyeing factory. (9) After the matter was resolved, the water supply was immediately restored. We hope that you will investigate this matter.</p>

<p>Escorted by the Public Security Bureau of This City</p>
<p>The Xiamen Public Security Bureau, based on a request from the abducted boys Zhu Rongwan and others to send them to Shanghai to be claimed nearby, and while waiting for the ship to depart, also received requests from Yao Sui (i.e., Shan Da Hai), Wang Yu Xi, Li Shui, and Ma Hai to be sent to Shanghai together. Li Sui, 12 years old, from Henan, lives in Cui Village, 5 li north of Yongcheng County, Henan. His grandfather's name is Li Siyuan. Wang Yuxi, 13 years old, lives on Northeast Street, Xuzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu. His father's name is Wang Zhigan, also known as Yi Su. Li Shui, 8 years old, is from Shandong, and Ma Hai, 8 years old, is from Henan. After questioning by the bureau, it was confirmed that they had been abducted. In accordance with their request, the bureau dispatched Officer Zhao Ronglin to lead the five abducted boys on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Guangli ship, which arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday. After landing at the Jinliyuan Wharf, Inspectors Zhang Zhishan and Wang Wenjun from the Supervision Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, along with the police in charge of the area, went to the wharf to take care of them and sent them to the Relief Section of the Second Division of the bureau for repatriation.</p>

<p>Boy Who Caused Trouble Sent to Biliang Police Station</p>
<p>Jiangbei child Wu Youshun, 16 years old, from the Qiahe Yarn Factory, was joking with fellow worker Ji Jintao in the common room at about 6 AM on the 28th of last month about who would be the first to sweep. Wu Youshun pushed Ji Jintao, who then unfortunately hit his waist on an iron cart, causing him to fall to the ground. The factory staff reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, and Detective Ruan Taibin rushed to the scene and sent the child to the hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he soon died. Wu was detained and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning. All details have been reported in this newspaper and are awaiting sentencing. Yesterday, Judge Shen Bingrong of the Third Criminal Court sentenced Wu Youshun to one year of imprisonment. The number of days he was detained before the judgment was finalized will be deducted, with two days of detention equivalent to one day of imprisonment. He will be sent to the Biliang Police Station Reformatory for two years of moral education.</p>

<p>Fire Department of the Northern District Appropriates Compensation</p>
<p>Yesterday's report stated that a fire engine in the Northern District of the Southern City ran over and killed Hu Shi when it passed in front of the Bulangxin Medicine Shop on Fangbang Road. It has now been learned that the 9th Pujiadi (local leader) Jiang Pingyang was ordered by the police station to report the incident to the local court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Wu and other medical examiners were dispatched to the scene and found that Hu Shi's death was caused by a head injury. The local leader was ordered to find the family of the deceased and provide a coffin. Yesterday evening, her husband Hu Zhongkang heard the news and arrived at the scene, grieving over the body. The police took Hu to the police station, where he stated that he was 25 years old, from Haimen, and currently residing at 437 Guangfu Temple Street, working as a peddler. The deceased was his wife, Hu Shi, also 25 years old, with two sons and one daughter. The eldest son is seven years old, the second son is five years old, and the daughter is four years old. His wife had been living in their hometown of Haimen and had just arrived in Shanghai from their hometown less than ten days ago. Now she has died tragically, and he requests justice. Yesterday, it was ordered that the driver, A Gao, who caused the accident, be sent to the Third Division of the Public Security Bureau for questioning. Meanwhile, the father of the deceased, Shi Shunqing, went to the Northern District Fire Department to request compensation. The director of the district, Lu Jinlin, contacted him and, considering that the family was very poor, agreed to provide 100 yuan in addition to the coffin and clothing. The body has already been placed in a coffin. In addition to the deceased, two pedestrians were also injured. One was Chen Degui, 52 years old, from Shanbei, the owner of the Chen Defeng Candle Shop south of the Shui Xian Temple, who suffered injuries to his kidneys and right knee. The other was Yang Yonghua, 57 years old, from Changzhou, who had been a teacher in his hometown and had come to Shanghai for business. He was residing at 44 North Xizang Road at the home of his nephew, the owner of the Shunxing Palm Mattress Shop. He suffered injuries to his forehead, right hand, left foot, and buttocks. His injuries were less severe than Chen's. Both injured men are currently being treated at the Shanghai Hospital.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Report on the Situation of the Shanghai Public Concession by Judge Fessenden, Volume 4 (15) <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>14. When the powers of the municipal government are strictly limited by law, the authority to order compensation for misused public funds is particularly important. Moreover, the central government also believes that using the method of auditing accounts to ensure that the municipal government complies with these restrictions is appropriate and effective. However, as far as auditing the accounts of the Shanghai Municipal Council is concerned, under the current situation, it does not seem necessary to grant the auditor the power to impose penalties and compensation. Furthermore, implementing this new law may cause difficulties and objections with the council. Therefore, whether it is appropriate is a question. My opinion is that if the auditor discovers any incidents involving the legal responsibility of any council member during the audit, the Board of Directors can exercise its discretion to handle the matter and file civil or criminal lawsuits against one or more of the related parties.</p>
<p>15. Therefore, to enable the auditor of the Municipal Council's accounts to perform their duties, I believe it is only necessary to allow them to freely inspect the Municipal Council's books and registers. At the same time, it should be clearly stipulated in the Council's rules that all Council employees should provide the auditor with all books, accounts, vouchers, and related documents and records for verification when needed.</p>
<p>D. Format of the Auditor's Report or Certificate</p>
<p>16. According to current practice, the auditor of the Municipal Council's accounts should sign a certificate in the following format at the end of the list of expenditures in the Municipal Council's accounts for the year published in the annual report: (The above accounts have been audited by the auditor together with the books and vouchers, and it is hereby certified that, according to the books and vouchers, the above accounts are free of errors.)</p>
<p>17. In some countries, there is another practice, namely that the auditor auditing the municipal government's accounts should sign a more detailed certificate, explaining various points that may or may not be considered included in the above ordinary certificate.</p>
<p>18. For example, the current municipal regulations of Durban stipulate that the auditor should annually certify the following matters:</p>
<p>(1) Whether the accounts of the Municipal Council are accurate;</p>
<p>(2) If there are any business ventures, whether all accounts are recorded separately;</p>
<p>(3) Whether the published accounts accurately reflect the financial position of the Municipal Council, the various matters it handles, and the results of its business (if any);</p>
<p>(4) Whether adequate preparations have been made to repay any funds borrowed by the Municipal Council, such as municipal bonds, promissory notes, or others;</p>
<p>(5) Whether the funds allocated to compensate for the depreciation and obsolescence of mechanical equipment are sufficient;</p>
<p>(6) Whether the value of municipally owned property is fair;</p>
<p>(7) Whether all the auditor's needs have been met, and whether their suggestions have been implemented.</p>
<p>19. I believe that it is beneficial for the certificate issued by the auditor to clearly include the above points. However, the wording of the above clauses should be revised, as some of them are more applicable to commercial businesses and not very applicable to public institutions. For example, regarding item (3), it has been pointed out to me that the municipal government's (financial position) ultimately depends on various factors not recorded in the accounts, such as the population in the city area and the assessed value of land and houses from which taxes can be collected. If this clause is amended to (the financial position as reflected in the Municipal Council's records), the wording would be more appropriate. Also, regarding item (6), it has been pointed out that it is extremely difficult for the auditor to issue a certificate proving (whether the value of all municipally owned property is fair). This is because most of the municipal government's property cannot be sold to obtain its value, such as bridges, sewers, and land acquired for road construction. These types of properties are listed under the (development account) in the Public Concession's statement of revenue and expenditure. Therefore, the auditor's certificate should specify the basis of valuation used, namely its cost. This wording would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>20. In addition, there is another point that could be suggested for inclusion in the certificate, namely that the auditor should specifically address the issue of tax collection and express experiences gained elsewhere. Laxity in tax collection is one of the most common causes of difficulties in municipal government accounts. Laxity gives rise to various malpractices, causing certain classes of people who are legally liable to pay taxes to evade property taxes or other municipal taxes, or failing to accurately estimate rents, so that all property taxes, whether levied based on the cost of the property or according to its rentable value, have accurate and uniform standards. Furthermore, in this regard, a clause could be added to the auditor's certificate, requiring the auditor to certify (whether all revenue obtainable from taxes has been calculated according to the regulations and with proper standards, and whether it has been appropriately recorded in the accounts).</p>
<p>21. As for the final clause, item (7), regarding the auditor's needs and recommendations, including it in the certificate may disclose matters that the auditor recommends should be kept confidential for the public interest. Therefore, in addition to issuing a certificate for publication, the auditor should be required to submit a report to the Finance Committee, so that they can freely and confidentially raise issues regarding the Municipal Council's registration of accounts or other financial management matters for the committee's consideration, without including the final clause in the published certificate. It seems that auditors of public institutions in the United Kingdom have adopted this approach.</p>
<p>22. I now propose that the format of the Durban auditor's certificate mentioned above be adopted after being modified as proposed above.</p>
<p>(Note 1) See Chapter 6 of Part 5 of this report.</p>
<p>(Note 2) See Section 43 of Chapter 6 of Part 5 of this report.</p>
<p>(Note 3) See Section 60 of Chapter 6 of Part 5 of this report.</p>
<p>(Note 4) See (1) and (10) of Section 6 of Chapter 6 of Part 5 of this report.</p>
<p>(Note 5) Regarding this point, see Section 20 and Sections 26-27 of Chapter 5 of Part 4 of this report.</p>
<p>(Note 6) The principle that government auditors should enjoy reasonable tenure protection is a well-recognized principle. The Durban Municipal Regulations have set a precedent for extending this principle to municipal government auditors. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e169">Eulogy <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Social customs regarding weddings and funerals differ between the past and the present. The extravagance of weddings is gradually being reduced and simplified. However, the extravagance of funerals has not only not decreased compared to the past, but has also become more extreme, increasingly hypocritical and extravagant! Therefore, grand weddings are becoming less common, while grand funerals, using the deceased to show off, are becoming more and more frequent.</p>
<p>Since the political reform, everything has been transitioning from aristocratic to democratic. However, when it comes to funerals, things revert from democratic to aristocratic. As long as one is willing to spend money, even if it's a cat or a dog that has died, the funeral can be arranged with the pomp of high officials and nobles, complete with road signs, heralds, Western and Chinese music, grand retinues, and even the ceremonial guards from the City God Temple can be added. Gaining the praise of onlookers for the grand spectacle is considered the height of glory.</p>
<p>If it were just the grand funeral itself, that would be one thing. But those families who treat funerals as a performance also send out special obituaries, the thicker the better. I once saw an obituary printed for the death of an old foreman at a printing shop, which was two inches thick. The delivery men complained endlessly, blaming the printing shop owner for adding to the thickness. The shop spared no expense on its own products, but didn't consider that the couriers carrying the obituaries were almost crushed under the weight.</p>
<p>Inside the obituaries are stacks upon stacks of eulogies. When a village elder dies in the countryside, at least the village head and district chief are asked to write eulogies. When an old foreman of a grocery store dies in the city, at least the Minister of Industry and the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce are asked. These can still be considered appropriate to their status. Even more absurd are the forged eulogies from important figures, with phrases like "His merits will remain in the Republic" and "Kind heart and chivalrous spirit" printed on them, completely unrelated to the subject. Recently, when the father of a lawyer who specializes in soliciting lawsuits died, he reprinted eulogies from other people's obituaries, prominently displaying the names of central government officials on the obituary, which led to the official investigation and the humorous situation of seeking honor but finding shame.</p>
<p>Obituaries are inherently deceptive, with phrases like "weeping blood" and "in a daze from grief" already telling a great lie. Adding all kinds of inappropriate eulogies on top of that is like deception within deception, a great lie made even greater! Alas!</p>
<h3 id="e170">The Driving Force Behind Shanghai's Prosperity <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Butong</p>
<p>｜(Prostitution) (Gambling) (Opium)｜</p>
<p>How Shanghai has become so prosperous is a question worthy of study.</p>
<p>Some say that Shanghai's prosperity is due to its strategic location at the gateway to the Yangtze River, with convenient water and land transportation, attracting merchants from all directions. Some say that Shanghai's early opening to foreign trade and the arrival of foreigners, who landed in Shanghai and gradually mixed with people from all over, led to its prosperity. Others say that Shanghai is the financial center of the country, and its economic power has driven its prosperity.</p>
<p>On the surface, these reasons seem sufficient. However, a closer look at Shanghai's society reveals that the true driving force behind its prosperity is not these factors.</p>
<p>The primary driving force behind Shanghai's prosperity is (prostitution). Because of (prostitution), the catering and clothing industries have flourished day by day. When the Public Concession banned prostitution in the past, the market plummeted. As the "nightingales" moved south, the market in the French Concession gradually prospered. This is powerful proof.</p>
<p>The second driving force is (gambling). From roulette games with tens of thousands of silver taels at stake to flower games with a copper coin as the prize, all kinds of gambling are available. Those who lose gamble away their houses, lands, and even their wives and children. Smaller losses inevitably lead to pawning. This directly and indirectly supports the livelihoods of many people in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The third driving force is (opium). It directly benefits the owners and staff of opium dens, not to mention the indirect contribution to Shanghai's night market. The golden age of the French Concession saw opium dens lined up east of Eight Immortals Bridge, and the business of fruit stores and restaurants could be lively until dawn. This shows the greatness of its influence.</p>
<p>The market in the Chinese-controlled areas has never been prosperous because (prostitution), (gambling), and (opium) are prohibited. The market in the concessions is so good because (prostitution), (gambling), and (opium) are not prohibited. This is the fundamental reason for Shanghai's prosperity. It is said that the Japanese are promoting (prostitution), (gambling), and (opium) in the Northeast, which is quite logical.</p>

<p>— Hen</p>
<p>｜Originally a Deception｜</p>
<p>This is a news story about a comical, laughable, and scientific deception that occurred in Guangxi about two months ago. I can guarantee that this is not a fabricated story, as a friend who just came here from Guangxi told me about it.</p>
<p>Superstition in divine power is one of the most pathetic and despicable shortcomings of our Chinese people. Even in Shanghai, which is known as the most civilized city in Southeast Asia, there is still the Rainbow Temple and Wu Jianguang on Nanjing Road, which represents Shanghai. Not to mention the interior of Guangxi, which has not been baptized by 20th-century civilization. If we randomly ask a young villager there, "Who is the current Chairman of the National Government?" he will stare blankly and not know the answer. But if we ask him about the era and deeds of Guan Yu, he will answer fluently as if reciting family treasures. In every village, there are many temples. (God, give me happiness!) Every first and fifteenth day of the lunar month, one can see many pious men and women praying in any temple. Clever swindlers took advantage of this to perform their comical deception.</p>
<p>"Isn't this a true god descending? There is a statue of a god in a certain temple that can stand in the center of a box without ropes or anything else tying it." After this news spread, villagers from all villages came to this temple to worship. Sure enough, the rumors were true. Through a small hole in a sealed wooden box, one could see a statue of a god suspended in the center, indeed without anything tying it. The temple keeper (the one who looks after the temple) said, "This god has descended in person to investigate because there are many wicked people here. Everyone must sincerely pay respects to it." As a result, a lot of incense money flowed into the temple keeper's pocket.</p>
<p>Secrets cannot be kept from people forever. This strange thing was discovered by the local government, who sent someone to investigate. The trick was exposed. It turned out that the statue of the god was made of iron, and the surrounding of the box contained the same magnetic material. The suction force from all sides and above and below was equal, so the iron statue of the god was sucked in the middle. After the matter was clarified, this scientific god came to an end.</p>

<p>— Qi Huai</p>
<p>In old China, menstruation was called "tian gui" (heavenly gui). German farmers, however, call it the "rose crown."</p>
<p>Among savage races, women during menstruation are often confined. Among African natives, the place where women during menstruation reside must be marked with a red flag for identification.</p>
<p>The amount of menstrual blood each time ranges from about two fluid ounces to four fluid ounces, up to eight fluid ounces.</p>
<p>In countries around the world, the average age of women's first menstruation is 14.1 years in the United States. The earliest is in France, at 12.6 years, and the latest is in Russia and Switzerland, at 19 years. The earliest age for Japanese women is nine years and seven months, and the latest is twenty-one years and ten months. The average age in China is 17 years.</p>
<p>Menstruation occurs on average every 28 days, with a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of six weeks.</p>
<p>The most common duration of each menstruation is about three days. Followed by four to five days, five days, seven days, and four days.</p>
<p>According to old Chinese sayings, menstruation ceases at seven sevens, which is forty-nine years old: but according to Senisi's statistics, the average age is 47.1 years.</p>
<p>In addition to blood, menstrual blood also contains mucus, broken cells, bacteria, and granular debris.</p>
<p>A characteristic of menstrual blood is that it does not easily coagulate: even after a long time, it still maintains its inherent liquid state.</p>
<p>Menstruation is often seen as mysterious. According to Eckath's description, in Italy, menstrual cloths from a virgin's first menstruation are sold as amulets to ward off disease.</p>
<p>Mantello recorded that a child menstruated at the age of three and gave birth to a child at the age of six.</p>
<p>News Briefs Gu Tai-furen, the mother of Cai Diaotu, owner of the Guangming Theater and the Anlong newspaper, celebrated her sixtieth birthday on the sixth of this month. Mr. Diaotu specially prepared a longevity feast to celebrate his mother's birthday. Famous opera performers from Shanghai performed Peking opera at the Cai residence on that day. The performances numbered more than twenty. Gao Huizhu, the adopted granddaughter of Tai-furen, is a famous movie star. She also sang Peking opera and performed a play with Diaotu to honor her elders. It is also said that the birthday celebration was held at the main residence in Chenjiaxing Town, Sanlintang, Pudong. There were two reception areas, one at No. 8 Pu Bai Fang, Luban Road, Beishi, and one at Guanqiao, Nanshi. Pu Bai Fang had many cars available, while the Minnan Wheel Company at Guanqiao had special ships available to transport guests. It was very convenient for guests to go to the Cai residence. The special ship was scheduled to depart three times in the morning at 8:00, 10:00, and 12:00, and once in the afternoon at 2:00. It only takes one hour to reach the Cai residence, it is said.</p>

<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>But I don't know what the reason was? Muliang felt lost and absent-minded that night. He was too lazy to read the tabloids and too lazy to read novels. He smoked cigarettes particularly hurriedly, finishing a cigarette in less than half the usual time, throwing it into the spittoon with a "hiss" sound. In less than three minutes, the sound was heard again. As usual, after dinner, Aigu came to the bedroom to tidy up and arrange the things needed for the night. She was very busy walking back and forth. She also felt that the young master was different from usual. Wherever she went, two sharp eyes followed her relentlessly, especially when she got close to him. She could see him looking at her intensely, with an awkward smile.</p>
<p>While Lawyer Xia and Muliang were having a secret conversation in the study that had lasted for three hours without ending, Old Wang, the gatekeeper, came and whispered a few words in Muliang's ear. Muliang waved his hand and said, "Tell him to go to Lawyer Xia's residence tomorrow to talk." Old Wang agreed with a "yes" and went out to tell Liu Da, who had come from a remote village. Liu Da agreed and left. Then an irregular discussion meeting started in the gatehouse. Xiao San, the rickshaw puller, said first, "A young adopted daughter-in-law is worth at most two hundred yuan." Ah Liu, the deputy gatekeeper, said, "It's not like the villagers trading with each other in the countryside. Naturally, this amount is considered high. Now that villagers are trading with city people, why not make some good deals?" Lao Wu said resentfully, "The world is becoming less and less like the world. I'm afraid that in the future, all villagers will have no descendants." Xiao San said, "Old Uncle is wrong. With money, it's easy to find a wife, even two or three." Old Wang took a few big puffs of the remaining yellow tobacco from the pipe. In the very light smoke, he said, "Even if they agree to the request, two hundred yuan, five or six years of hard work, food and clothing, is more than just this amount! Maybe you can't even get that much in hand." Just as he was about to express some moral arguments, the master had already sent Lawyer Xia out, so they had to end the discussion without a conclusion.</p>
<p>The next day, Lawyer Xia came again and solemnly handed Muliang a red card that was a bit worn. Muliang took it and brought out one hundred and fifty yuan from inside and handed it to Lawyer Xia. From then on, Aigu's (jurisdiction) was transferred.</p>
<p>A week later, Muliang held a banquet and invited relatives and friends to have a celebratory drink. Everyone congratulated him on his good fortune in getting a beautiful concubine. But the first wife was so angry that she didn't eat for a day, deeply regretting that she had put in so much effort before to change her to adapt to the times and made it easy for her husband.</p>
<p>As for Aigu, she was probably smug, right?</p>

<h3 id="e174">Gold Prices Fell Last Week <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>｜Reversal After Three Weeks of Continuous Rise｜</p>
<p>Last week, the gold market's telegraphic prices fluctuated. Although the daily fluctuations were moderate, unlike the previous violent ups and downs, the news of the national team's selling off caused people to lose hope. Initially, due to the near-rise in silver prices and the fall in American cotton, the market opened high, with the December price at 753.8 taels, an increase of 1.4 taels. Later, as exchange rates turned favorable and spot demand rose, the market became active, and the central bank's absorption of spot goods caused the price to reach 759.1 taels in the afternoon. The next day, the exchange rate rose, and the market saw a sudden reversal, falling sharply by more than 10 taels, breaking through the 50-tael mark. After the silver market and exchange rate rose, the price reached 43 taels. Later, as American companies settled their accounts, the price fluctuated, although the domestic market was long. Because there was news that the United Kingdom was considering restoring the gold standard after suspending it, opponents were very strong, causing gold prices to trend downward. Until Thursday, when there was news that 21 banks of various sizes in the United States had collapsed, gold prices immediately rebounded back above the 50-tael mark. Unexpectedly, Hengxing continued to sell aggressively. There was also a Reuters report that the US Treasury's silver reserves were insufficient, causing negative news such as the plan to purchase raw silver to spread. The market was filled with pessimism, and the price finally fell to 43.2 taels. Later, as the silver market was stable and the Shanghai exchange rate was also stable, Hengxing continued to sell relentlessly, preventing the market price from rising. Fortunately, the US exchange rate was still strong, which stabilized the market. Until Saturday, when the European exchange rate seemed firm, the British exchange rate continued to rise, and the US exchange rate remained unchanged, but the overnight bearish view was not fulfilled, and the forward price rebounded. The market's sentiment softened, and gold prices fell slightly. Hengxing and Yifeng continued to sell non-stop, with the price suddenly dropping to a low of 742 taels in the morning. At the close, the price was 44.9 taels. Comparing with the previous Saturday, the price fell by 7.5 taels, a reversal after three weeks of continuous rise of 26.9 taels. The difference between the highest and lowest prices for the entire week was 17.1 taels (the difference between the opening and closing prices was 8.9 taels). It is said that Hengxing alone sold about 13,000 to 14,000 bars this week. It is estimated that the profit is over 10 taels per bar. The various firms, such as Dalian Gang, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Tianfengyong, etc., were all long. The short firms include Tongtaichang, Yuanmaoyong, Yifeng, and Ruikang. As for the overseas silver market, the British silver price continued to rise, and the US silver price rebounded. The local exchange market went in the opposite direction. The listed British gold price fell by half a point (125), and the US gold price was flat. The exchange rate turned high, so the British side was tight and the American side was loose. The exchange rate was initially around 60 taels, and later it was 70 taels. It is estimated that the exchange rate of British to American rose by 1.125 points, and the US to British rebounded by 1.375 points, a rebound after falling for seven weeks. The trend this week is expected to be a consolidation. The high and low prices of the British and American silver markets and the gold market are listed below:</p>

<p>| Small Profit, Peaceful Market |</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and banks were closed as usual. Although money shops operated normally, business procedures were inevitably reduced.

<h3 id="e176">Securities Bonds Slightly Up Last Week <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>| Trend Gradually Stabilizing, Very Stagnant on Weekends |</p>
<p>| Total Turnover of Over 25 Million for the Whole Week |</p>
<p>The bond market situation of the Chinese Business Securities Exchange from October 31st to November 5th last week showed that the spot trading volume was higher than the previous week. Most bonds were actively traded, with a total turnover of 122,000 yuan for the whole week, including 40,000 yuan for salt tax bonds, and around 13,000 yuan each for demobilization, 20-customs, 19-customs, and financial bonds. Full six and demobilization bonds were about 9,000 yuan. Other transactions were less active. In the futures market, the price settlement rose at the beginning of the week, and trading was very active. The market sentiment was very lively, with weekly trading reaching 7.8 million. Tuesday also had 5.5 million yuan. Afterward, it gradually calmed down. From Wednesday to Friday, the daily turnover was around 3 million yuan. The weekend was very slow, with only 1.8 million yuan. Statistics for the whole week show a total turnover of 25,140,000 yuan, an increase of over 4 million yuan compared to the previous week. Among them, unified salt tax bonds were the most active, with 4.93 million yuan for November contracts and 10,000 yuan for December contracts. Unified tax bonds had 30,000 yuan for December contracts and 4.14 million yuan for November contracts. Demobilization and 20-customs bonds followed. Demobilization bonds had 2,375,000 yuan for November contracts and 1,485,000 yuan for December contracts. 20-customs bonds had 3,230,000 yuan for November contracts and 15,000 yuan for December contracts. 20-series bonds had 2,785,000 yuan for November contracts and 45,000 yuan for December contracts. Others also performed better than before. 19-customs bonds had 1,790,000 yuan for November contracts and 35,000 yuan for December contracts. 19-series bonds had 1,455,000 yuan for November contracts and 10,000 yuan for December contracts. Demobilization bonds had 1,430,000 yuan for November contracts and 5,000 yuan for December contracts. Customs bonds for the next month had 710,000 yuan. Full six bonds for the next month had 415,000 yuan. 96 public bonds had 145,000 yuan. Financial bonds had 10,000 yuan. In addition, the total for November contracts of various bonds was 23.4 million, but December contracts were only 1.74 million. Regarding the price trend of various bonds last week, it has been slightly more stable than the previous week, and daily fluctuations were uncertain, rising and falling suddenly. There was no consistent trend, indicating that the price increase of various bonds is gradually coming to an end. The domestic and international situation did not see major developments during this period. The bond market environment was more dull than before, and market sentiment was increasingly cautious. Therefore, the first two days of the week were generally active, but later became more idle. On Monday, only full six and demobilization bonds rose by more than one yuan, and other bonds did not change significantly. On Tuesday, there were mutual gains and losses, with fluctuations of only a few jiao. Wednesday saw a slight decrease of one or two jiao. Thursday saw gains of three or four jiao to seven or eight jiao. The weekend saw a slight contraction, but the amount was small. As a result, demobilization, full six, and financial bonds continued to rise by one yuan and four or five jiao compared to the previous week. However, many spot goods rose significantly, mainly due to the removal of principal and interest from the previous period. Looking at the future of the bond market, it will return to calmness. If the environment does not change, the market is unlikely to develop before mid-month. The following is a statistical list of the high and low prices of various bonds last week (unit: yuan; the price fluctuations of various spot goods such as coupons and demobilization are calculated after deducting the principal and interest of the previous period):</p>

<p>| "Ren" Character Hits New Low |</p>
<p>Cotton yarn prices fell sharply last week due to the recovery of overseas cotton markets and sluggish domestic demand. The tight financial situation affected all groups, making them unable to procure supplies. Consequently, spot yarn business was quite quiet. Currently, Japanese merchants are dumping large quantities of Japanese yarn in the Yangtze River region, impacting local yarn prices. Although this year's harvest is plentiful in the Gengsi countryside, low prices for agricultural products have made life difficult for the villagers, resulting in weak purchasing power. As a result, most speculators are actively selling off their holdings. At the same time, some manufacturers are very willing to sell "Ren" character, ship, and cotton flower yarns, and are willing to compromise on prices. Therefore, sellers have abundant inventory. Although Wing On speculators are still struggling to hold on, the environment is too bad, and the trend is unstoppable, leading to new lows in the market. Later in the week, American cotton prices rose slightly, prompting profit-takers to cover their short positions, slightly increasing market conditions. As for yarn sales to Sichuan, the war is ongoing, and purchases have not started. There are occasional purchases of long-term futures from old customers. Business from other regions is quite slow. A total of 7,279 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the week, with "Zhong" character goods accounting for the majority. Standard yarn speculators have closed their positions, and prices for each month have fallen by 2 taels and 14 qian compared to the previous week. Total turnover for the week was 129,650 bales. The volume purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Group　Bale Quantity　Group　Bale Quantity　Group　Bale Quantity　Xiamen 72</p>

<p>| Weak Factory Demand...Weary American Cotton |</p>
<p>The cotton market has been trending downwards for the past week, due to the lifeless American cotton market and the sluggish yarn market. There is no demand for spot cotton, and factories have no intention of purchasing. Furthermore, prices in the United States are falling sharply, with many predicting that the 6-cent level for American cotton may be difficult to maintain. The volume of cotton being sold by a certain manufacturer is increasing, adding to the pressure. As a result, the market is difficult to reverse, and sentiment is unanimously bearish. Midway through the week, the slight fall in gold prices triggered a sudden plunge in the market, reaching new lows. The low price for November delivery was once seen at 29 taels and 7 qian and a half. Shortly thereafter, American cotton rebounded, and profit-takers took the opportunity to cover their short positions, leading to a recovery in market conditions. As for village cotton prices, they are still unwilling to budge, but the deteriorating environment and future prospects are still dependent on American cotton. The source of supply at the docks includes 5,743 bales of Yao cotton and 8,010 bales of regular cotton. Prices for various months of standard cotton have fallen by 1 tael to 7, 8, and 9 qian compared to the previous week. Total turnover for the week was 397,100 dan. American cotton turnover was similar to the previous week, while spot cotton transactions were quieter. The volume of spot cotton purchased by each manufacturer is listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton Type　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Transaction Price　Delivery Term</p>
<p>Beixinjing 18.50 ··· 500 bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<h3 id="e181">Grain and Rice Market: Active Sales Turn Quiet <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, about 40 ships from various groups arrived in the Luli area of ​​South Shanghai. There was some stock in the port, but due to the tight money supply, transactions were dull. Changxi North and Su Tong groups lowered prices by a few jiao, and the six types of rice were sold slowly. Prices continued to rise. Tongbian flower, Yuanyin, and Huasan types of rice were not heavily burdened, falling by 22 jiao per dan.</p>
<p>Yesterday at Xinzha, about 35 or 36 rice boats from Changxi, Xianzi, and other groups arrived. City and rural stores were not performing well. Kunshan and Jiangyin rice softened by a few jiao per day. Changpiao rice was fresh and stable. The central area was slightly weaker. Luyangjian rice was unremarkable.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Hunan Xiangxian Cargo to Arrive in Shanghai Soon <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was completely stagnant. As river rice prices fell, the street had no further use for it. Customers disliked the price, and there was no inquiry from actual consumers. Therefore, it was quiet all day, and there were no transactions in the overall market. Fuzhou groups still had a strong appetite, but they were paying attention to the Ke Xian rice, and had no interest in foreign rice. The previously arrived Xiang-Gan Ke Xian rice had all been purchased by this group, and recent stocks had run out. There was a gap in the new supply, so there were no transactions yesterday. However, two batches of Hunan rice have been loaded and are on their way, the first batch of about four or five hundred bags, will arrive today or tomorrow. It is expected that the Fuzhou group will take most of the supply when it arrives, as the North group is taking a wait-and-see attitude, and the street has no intention of intervening, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Hardware and Small Nails: Quiet Before the Storm <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and there was no significant progress in hardware transactions. However, local customers did make some small purchases, so the market situation was not too deserted. The market was generally stable yesterday. However, judging from the market conditions of small nails, there was a sense of quiet before the storm. It is estimated that more than 200 barrels were offered in total, with prices of 12.75 taels for three-fen nails, 13 taels for four-fen nails, 12.25 taels for five-fen nails, and 12 taels for six-fen nails. Customers along the Yangtze River were the most active, and Tianjin and Qingdao groups also made some purchases. Unfortunately, the supply of goods arriving later is extremely small. Looking at the future prospects, the trend seems to be getting better. In addition, several hundred dan of British steel plates were also offered, with no significant change in prices. There were no transactions in tinplate, corrugated iron, small Guangzhou leather, red gang leather, new lead, etc., and there were no changes in price levels either.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Wearing High Hats <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>｜Five of the Art of Living｜</p>
<p>Wearing high hats is flattery, and people who like to wear high hats are, after all, willing to admit it. This is generally common psychology. The so-called "Thousands of wears, ten thousand wears, flattery never wears out," but there are also differences. Some people know that others are giving me a high hat, and pretend not to know. Some people wear high hats themselves and are still clueless, which is truly pitiful.</p>
<p>Cao Cao was truly a treacherous villain. Sun Guan once sent him a high hat, and he knew it. In the twenty-fourth year of Emperor Xian of Han, Sun Guan submitted a memorial, claiming allegiance to Cao, and speaking of the Mandate of Heaven. Cao showed it to outsiders, saying, "Is this child trying to put me on the stove?" At that time, Chen Qun and several other ministers were all doing favors and desperately sending high hats to Cao Cao, saying, "Your Highness's merits are towering, you should assume the great position." Cao said, "If the Mandate of Heaven is with me, I will be King Wen of Zhou." He ultimately refused to wear this high hat, which was his cleverness.</p>
<p>But some people wear high hats themselves and still don't realize it, which is truly laughable. The "Sayings of Master Lianchi" states, "In the past, an old monk said, 'There is no one in the world who does not like fame,' and then sighed deeply. One person in the audience stood up and asked, 'Indeed, as you say, is the only one who does not like fame?' The old monk was very happy, not knowing that a high hat had been gently placed on his head. He was still pleased with himself. From this, we can see that if someone offers you a high hat, it is very difficult to completely refuse it.</p>
<p>My poetry is completely unrefined, and I can't do it well, and I don't even know when I've lost rhyme. Because of the words "high hat," I once wrote a crooked poem. No matter what, I'll write it below for the readers to have a laugh. On the Lantern Festival, a friend gave me a Western hat and wrote, "I offer you a high hat as a New Year's greeting for prosperity and good fortune." I sang it as a joke:</p>
<p>I am grateful for your gift of a high hat,</p>
<p>Bright and dazzling, beyond compare.</p>
<p>I ask, from where did this object come?</p>
<p>You spent a fortune to buy it in the market.</p>
<p>There are so many high hats here,</p>
<p>Even a stubborn person like you has one.</p>
<p>How elegant are the caps and belts in the world,</p>
<p>Carriages follow each other in extravagance.</p>
<p>I am just a cooking dog butcher,</p>
<p>A monkey in a hat, shaming the country.</p>
<p>I tell the snobs of the world,</p>
<p>Don't let Zhang wear Li's hat.</p>

<p>— Xu Lige</p>
<p>In the past, the League of Nations was majestic,</p>
<p>But it has not stopped the fierce tigers and wolves.</p>
<p>How many weak and small sympathize with me,</p>
<p>The rabbit dies, the fox grieves, and resentment is unbearable.</p>
<p>Resulting in unfair joint control,</p>
<p>What is left for a thousand years to judge?</p>
<p>Such a large institution has lost its credibility,</p>
<p>Relying on an empty city as a Great Wall is absurd.</p>
<p>The old and still romantic Lord Lytton,</p>
<p>His spirit was ultimately sacrificed in vain.</p>
<p>Truly knowing the result would be like this,</p>
<p>He regrets welcoming them at the time. (In return)</p>

<h3 id="e196">Method for Manufacturing By-products During Salt Production <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Department Heart</p>
<p>When manufacturing table salt, regardless of the method used, a large amount of bittern is inevitably produced, hence it is a by-product of salt production. It tastes bitter, is a yellow oily liquid with a specific gravity of 1.20-1.28. Besides the remaining table salt, its main components are magnesium chloride and magnesium sulfate, and it also contains small amounts of chlorides, sulfates, and bromide iodides. Therefore, it can be used to produce magnesium sulfate and magnesium carbonate, and the method is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Method for Producing Magnesium Sulfate: Because magnesium sulfate is not easily dissolved in a liquid containing a large amount of magnesium chloride, this effect can be used to place the bittern in the refrigerator. In the cold of winter, magnesium sulfate will crystallize and precipitate as translucent crystals.</p>
<p>Then, add hot clean water to a pot to reach about 70 degrees, and gradually add the impure magnesium sulfate crystals, stirring to dissolve them. Stop adding when the specific gravity of the mother liquor reaches 36 degrees, and let it stand to settle the mixed impurities. After about 10 hours, filter it through a sand filter, and the temperature must be maintained between 50 and 60 degrees at this time. Cool the filtrate, and magnesium sulfate crystals will precipitate on the liquid surface at a temperature of about 10 degrees. If the obtained crystals are not good, use a sprayer to spray dew-like water to thin the surface, and crystals will precipitate from the lower layer. After the crystals are completely formed, take them out and dry them to obtain refined magnesium sulfate. Because the remaining residual liquid still contains a small amount of magnesium sulfate, it can be mixed into the next batch of liquid to continue crystallization. After three or four times, the residual liquid contains many impurities and can be discarded. Usually, about 70 pounds of pure magnesium sulfate can be obtained from 100 pounds of impure magnesium sulfate. The crystals are prismatic or needle-like crystals, soluble in twice their weight of water, and the solution should be neutral. Adding silver nitrate will not produce a white precipitate, and adding ammonium carbonate will also not produce a precipitate. The above-mentioned properties are usually used to identify whether magnesium sulfate is pure. It is the well-known Epsom salt in medicine and can also be used as fertilizer and in dyeing. It can also be used to make soap.</p>
<p>The territory has been lost, and most of it is still dancing. If they do not wake up early, they will be caught in one net.</p>
<p>(2) Method for Producing Magnesium Carbonate: After the magnesium sulfate crystals are precipitated from the bittern, the remaining liquid still contains a large amount of magnesium chloride. Although this substance can be made into pure products, it has no value, so it is now used to make magnesium carbonate.</p>
<p>The method is to filter the bittern after the magnesium sulfate is precipitated through sand and use a Baume hydrometer to measure its specific gravity. Then, dissolve sodium carbonate in water to make its specific gravity equal to that of the bittern, let it stand for two hours to precipitate impurities, and then slowly inject it into the bittern, stirring it. The reaction will produce magnesium carbonate precipitate. The temperature should be maintained at around 60 degrees at this time. The amount of magnesium carbonate solution added should be 62.3% of the bittern. After completely adding it, let it stand for one or two hours, then add a little more sodium carbonate solution. If no precipitate continues to form, it can be filtered. Take the precipitate and put it in a washing tank. This tank is a rectangular wooden trough with a depth of two feet six inches, a length of six feet, and a width of four feet. There is a drainage outlet at the bottom, and the tank is filled with two or three inches of sand particles, covered with a piece of cloth. After the magnesium carbonate is transferred in, slowly inject clean water to wash it for about 20 hours to remove sulfates and chlorides. Then, wrap it in cloth to remove its moisture and dry it to obtain pure magnesium carbonate. Approximately one stone and five dou of bittern plus 180 pounds of sodium carbonate can yield 100 pounds of magnesium carbonate. It is a white, odorless, loose powder that can be completely dissolved in 50 times its weight of dilute nitric acid. Adding magnesium nitrate and silver nitrate will not produce a white precipitate. If one part of magnesium carbonate is added to 20 parts of distilled water, the liquid is filtered and evaporated to dryness, it will not produce a large amount of precipitate. These properties are usually used to identify the quality of magnesium carbonate. It can be used to make fire bricks and hard building materials, so it is often used in building construction.</p>

<h3 id="e197">The So-called (Improving Children) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Xinshan</p>
<p>In China, (children) have always been neglected, and everyone has regarded them as unimportant. But today, it has become a serious problem. Many educators have completely shifted their focus in this direction, dedicating their entire bodies to this cause! Because children are like the young sprouts of plants, if education is improper in this era, it is easy to submerge their pure nature and destroy their immature minds. In the future, they will grow up to be nothing more than disabled beings unfit for society!</p>
<p>Children are the foundation of the country. Can we heartlessly allow their nature to be submerged, their minds to be destroyed, and thus lead the country to ruin?·······</p>
<p>For these reasons, I have read Mr. Feifei's so-called (Improving Children) article. I read it again and again, and it greatly stirred my interest in this issue. I would like to say something that doesn't quite fit in. Fortunately, our Mr. Feifei has added a tail to the end of his article: "What do the editors think? What do the members of this association and the readers think?" As a small reader (I really dare not, and am not worthy to be called Mr. Feifei's colleague), I respectfully accept this opportunity to say what I want to say.</p>
<p>Mr. Feifei's long, 900-word article on what children urgently need to (improve) lists ten items: (1) Children must decide their own (color) of clothes, decide their own (style), and decide their own (material); (2) Clothes must (not be too tight) and (not be too loose); (3) Clothes must not be worn too warmly</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>or too coolly; (4) Clothes must be worn neatly and completely, and the family must have a dressing mirror, a clothes rack, and a clothes brush···· Unfortunately, I cannot fully introduce it here, please readers turn to the old newspaper to appreciate it themselves. In short, Mr. Feifei has exhausted his mind and spent much effort thinking about (improving) children's (clothing and footwear). He can truly be called an angel for children! (Clothing and footwear) expert!</p>
<p>But (angels) are nothing but religious people's lies to deceive fools and earn their own living! (Angels) will never truly benefit children! Our Mr. Feifei has also made a mistake! Alas! Alas, our Mr. Feifei has also made a mistake!</p>
<p>We are extremely saddened by the extravagance of modern people! We are extremely distressed by modern people's obsession with fashion! Extravagance and fashion are things for young ladies and young masters, but can (young ladies) and (young masters) save the country from its difficulties? We are precisely distressed by the fact that there are so many young ladies and young masters in our declining China, and we are still madly manufacturing more? None of the ten items that Mr. Feifei calls good is anything other than wanting to make every child dress up as neatly and elegantly as a young master or young lady. Dressing neatly, fetching rice and pouring water, and calling for servants to stand around? Apart from this, with their pure nature submerged and their immature minds destroyed, what good is there? As for dressing mirrors, clothes racks, clothes brushes, etc., even I, who can barely hold a pen to write, would not meet Mr. Feifei's criteria even if I starved for a week: I don't know about other people's homes.</p>
<p>Our children are like this, Mr. Feifei, please listen to my song:</p>
<p>(Our) children, wear clothes made of old cloth,</p>
<p>Splattered with mud,</p>
<p>The sleeves and trouser legs are always rolled high to the elbows and knees, and sometimes they go barefoot to the fields with hoes;</p>
<p>Sometimes they go to the threshing ground with axes and saws;</p>
<p>They also read books, sing songs, and go to school.</p>
<p>(Our) children are truly the pillars of society, the beams of the country!</p>

<p>— Xianhuang</p>
<p>Clang, clang, clang... the class bell rang, and the geography teacher, nicknamed "The Barber," walked slowly into the classroom.</p>
<p>"Teacher, hello!" Li said with a very comical tone.</p>
<p>"Li, calm down, no shouting in class," the geography teacher said sternly.</p>
<p>"Teacher, you're too intolerant, how can you scold people?" Zhu said, appearing to be defending Li. "Zhu, don't be nosy, or I'll be rude," the teacher said, his face turning red as he scolded Zhu.</p>
<p>"Teacher, why are you called a barber?" Li asked with a smile.</p>
<p>"Li, have you prepared your lesson?" The geography teacher pretended to be deaf as he asked Li.</p>
<p>"Ask away! At most, I'll get a zero," Li replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"What is the name of the largest island in Asia?"</p>
<p>"Teacher, a razor blade!"</p>
<p>"Ha..." Many classmates couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"Li, do you want to continue studying?" The geography teacher's face turned white with anger.</p>
<p>"Hey! That's strange! If I didn't want to continue studying, I wouldn't have come long ago!"</p>
<p>"You are truly a little hooligan."</p>
<p>"Teacher, then you are an old geezer, right?"</p>
<p>"Bastard! Get out!"</p>
<p>"Get out? I won't get out."</p>
<p>"Get out!" The geography teacher, with a stern face, ran down from the podium and tried to pull Li.</p>
<p>"Let go! I don't need you to pull me."</p>
<p>Clang, clang, clang... the class bell rang, and the geography teacher had no choice but to swallow his anger and leave the classroom.</p>
<p>"The Barber..." strange calls continued. (In return)</p>

<h3 id="e199">The Three Contradictions of Modern Women <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Xuebiao</p>
<p>The term "modern woman" is all the rage in modern society, but since I became aware of this term, I have discovered many contradictions in them. Now, let me tell you about them:</p>
<p>(1) When we look at ordinary modern women, their hair is as long as ten thousand black snakes, and we can often see long hair hanging down their shoulders like Louis XIV's. Some part it in the middle with a pale white line and comb it into two thick and short braids on both sides. Some perm it into stiff hedgehog-like spikes, which may be said to be the most fashionable. But what is the difference between this and the braids and buns of the past? The purpose of cutting hair is for fashion, hygiene, convenience, saving time, and practicality, but now, changing to long hair is considered fashionable, and the time spent is about the same as before when keeping long hair. What is the point of this? So, this is one of their contradictions.</p>
<p>(2) Looking again at the clothes of ordinary modern women, let's take the cheongsam as an example. From cheongsams with wide sleeves and long hems to cheongsams with wide sleeves and short hems, and then to cheongsams with narrow sleeves and long hems, the styles are ever-changing. The most fashionable cheongsams now have sleeves that are short to above the elbows and so narrow that they cling to the arms. And the length of the dress? It is so long that it drags on the ground even when wearing high heels, exposing a large section of fair arms to attract attention. This is Europeanization. Just like skirts dragging on the ground in the past, it is only fifty steps compared to a hundred steps with Chinese traditional customs! So, this is their second contradiction.</p>
<p>(3) Finally, let's appreciate their feet! High-heeled shoes are the most European thing possible! Modern women always need them, but foreign women wear the same high-heeled shoes very differently. They have a healthy gait. When Chinese women wear them, they move with delicate steps and give a feeling of being too weak to withstand the wind. What is the difference between this and the bound feet of the past? It really makes people wonder where the beauty lies. This is their third contradiction.</p>
<p>After saying a lot above, I can summarize it in one sentence: I think that modern women, besides beauty, should pay attention to being convenient for action and operation, because they are singing loudly about women's liberation. Then, shouldn't they use their strength to fight for it? Of course, they can't be like the young ladies of the past, who would fall over in the wind! And they can't have three servants and four maids to support them, but now they are wearing gourd-shaped cheongsams and a pair of high-heeled shoes that resemble bound feet. Don't mention working, even walking is like a wobbly tumbler, so I say they are not worthy of being modern women. Truly modern women are the girls in the countryside who are qualified. I will frankly and impolitely call these fake modern women contradictory women!</p>

<p>To Mr. Lu Ziwei: I read the article on the manufacturing method of wheat essence in the Science section of the Shen Bao Local Supplement. It is extremely simple and everyone can make it themselves. It is convenient for both hygiene and economy. However, the article does not clearly state how to remove the residue of wheat and glutinous rice when using a certain amount of wheat to sprout and cook into a paste, and a certain amount of glutinous rice to cook into rice, and then mixing and fermenting it into sugar, in order to make pure sugar. This inevitably makes those who want to follow the method have no way to start. Would you please be willing to explain it further? With sincere wishes for your well-being, Gao Zixun, residing at No. 51, Zhengxiu Lane, Kaifeng Road, this city.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Clara Bow's New Career <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Bing</p>
<p>The new Clara Bow has long forgotten the former Clara Bow, and she hopes Hollywood will also forget her. Because people generally say she is making a "comeback," but Clara herself claims this is the beginning of her "new career," not a "comeback," let alone a "return to the screen."</p>
<p>This is a new beginning. The past indulgences only serve as a reminder for the current Clara. She has now completely changed her demeanor and views. The new Clara Bow is a mature and accomplished actress. Her childishness has disappeared, and she has now become a dignified and capable actress.</p>
<p>She now has a new house. She told people, "From now on, I will observe the new trends in Hollywood from this window." It is not because the old house on Peveley Hill was not suitable, but because it gave her many bad memories and images.</p>
<p>She is now an actress with Fox Film Corporation. The Fox decorators were extremely concerned about her dressing room. They first inquired about her dressing room at Paramount Pictures, which was completely decorated in black and gold. So, they also planned to paint her new dressing room in black and gold. But when the new Clara heard about this plan, she sincerely thanked the decorators for their sincerity, but requested that green and white colors be used instead.</p>
<p>The purpose of her "new career" is certainly to make money, but before she decided to shoot "Call Her Savage," she had considered the scripts proposed by various companies and her own role. She finally accepted the contract from Fox Film Corporation. (It is said that she will be paid 125,000 gold dollars for each film.)</p>

<h3 id="e204">What Kind of Movies Do We Need? <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Jizhong</p>
<p>Everyone, you don't think that movies are the only tool for entertainment, do you? Undoubtedly, they have the important task of raising people's knowledge, promoting national culture, reforming society, and improving everything. Especially, we can believe that the trends and styles of movies in any country are related to the lifeline of the entire country. Facts are powerful proof, and I will write down some of the more obvious ones here.</p>
<p>(1) The trend of American movies is that they always carry a display of splendor and magnificence, fully showing the atmosphere of singing, dancing, and prosperity. With a lot of money, American movies can never get rid of the color of extravagance and waste, that is, ideal movies, artistic movies, and aristocratic movies. On the one hand, they also specialize in depicting and inserting the love between men and women and the private affairs of romance as necessary. The whole of America is also in the microcosm of movies.</p>
<p>(2) Japan's film industry is indeed still immature and not as good as ours, but in terms of consciousness and reason, they are undoubtedly much superior to us. They do not make supernatural movies such as flying swords and fighting magic to anesthetize the entire society. At the same time, they do not shoot erotic and romantic movies to poison young men and women. Bushido is their standard for shooting movies, encouraging the greatness of war, promoting the spirit of fighting. Killing is their entire way out. Thus, people's consciousness and concepts are fully affected by the movies. One hundred and twenty percent unreasonable invasion of China's Northeast, but the people still shouted loudly, willing to be the backing. Although the reasons for this are very complicated, the impact created by the art of film also accounts for an important part.</p>
<p>(With national disasters approaching and national affairs becoming increasingly difficult,) our film industry should take some responsibility. Then, we should swear that we will never again shoot movies of licentiousness, theft, absurdity, gods, demons, or romance. What we need are movies that are realistic and not ideal, diligent and thrifty and not extravagant, active and not passive, brave and not decadent. At the same time, they are resistant and not non-resistant, and the spirit of fighting and killing is even more indispensable as a background. The movie industry, which is like an ox, can wake up.</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Second Chinese Movie Star? <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenhua</p>
<p>Translated from Film Pictorial</p>
<p>The first Chinese movie star in the American film industry was Ms. Anna May Wong, who was already highly respected by American filmmakers. Now, continuing after Ms. Wong, the second Chinese movie star is Toshi Mori (transliteration). She already has a good reputation in the United States and has now signed a five-year contract with Columbia Pictures.</p>
<p>She is only nineteen years old. Although she was born in Kyoto, she grew up in the United States. She was discovered in Chinatown in the United States, because Columbia Pictures was looking for a Chinese actress to play a role in the film *The Bitter Tea of General Yen*. Therefore, they gave her a temporary contract. After the filming was completed, they signed a new five-year contract.</p>
<p>She said it was very sudden, because she had not been able to find a job for two years. During that time, no one noticed her. She thought she was going to fail, but suddenly Columbia noticed her. She is truly extremely lucky.</p>
<p>This (Chinese movie star)’s name is Toshi Mori. Isn't that a name that is living proof of sharing our (race and culture)? And she was born in Kyoto. Is that Kyoto (Japan)? Our national power in China is so weak, would we still try to pass off their nationality as ours? This is a bit strange. - Editor's Note</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>Louis Milestone's opinion: Joan Crawford's performance in *Rain* was the best, because that film was shot on Catalina Island. There were not as many friends or visitors watching her as on an ordinary set. In reality, she is a neurotic and shy woman, and she hates having people surrounding her and watching her. Therefore, when filming her, it is best to have no one except the necessary staff and cameramen.</p>

<h3 id="e207">On the Trend of Soviet Films in the Past Fifteen Years (Continued) <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yi</p>
<p>｜Based on H.A.P.’s Opinion｜</p>
<p>However, general films, up to now, have not undertaken such tasks in terms of their effectiveness. Only Soviet films are very popular in educational practices. The adoption of films in this kind of educational practice is sufficient to help and accomplish the needs of (rearmament). Films like (Fragment of an Empire), which relies solely on the use of a (spoken) film course to actively study the psychological spread of a character representative, stimulate Soviet cinema to move towards a richer purpose than (making masterpieces).</p>
<p>Now, Soviet films are able to turn to pre-revolution times to find their themes. Although they have done so before, at that time it was mostly just a general record; now it is a special record of the various subtleties of human life. *Earth*, produced in 1930 during a turbulent time, was when Soviet films were in a period of decline, although not to the point of obscurity. We suddenly saw vestiges of epic pastorals. Under such circumstances, this was indeed a large and far-reaching adventure. The director, Dovzhenko, is not inexperienced, and in *Arsenal*, he had already shown his abilities and won praise. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Anecdotes from the Film Industry</p>
<h3 id="e208">A Study of the Costumes of a Hollywood Actress <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>The costumes of ordinary actresses in Hollywood are of course very beautiful. Among them, at least one actress spends £5,000 a year on her clothes.</p>
<p>This actress is Lilyan Tashman. She recently returned to Hollywood from Paris and New York, bringing eleven boxes of coats, underwear, and sportswear. But these clothes are not intended for use on the screen; they are just new clothes that she made before becoming Mrs. Edmund Lowe, before her wedding. Although she is very particular about clothing, she says to people:</p>
<p>(What I wear in my spare time is much simpler than what I wear on the screen. The workmanship and materials are not as exquisite as those on the screen.)</p>
<p>(When women all over the world see the clothes that I and other actresses wear on the screen, they rush to imitate them. This is completely wrong. The clothes on the screen are suitable for photography. If you wear these kinds of clothes on the street, they would inevitably be too flamboyant. They would be even more uncomfortable at home.)</p>
<p>She also told people that a woman's clothes must suit her figure. If she wears clothes that are excessively flamboyant, then all her actions must express a younger age, and she should walk faster. If her clothes are very dignified and trailing on the ground, then her body should be upright, making her look like a beautiful queen to others.</p>
<p>Film Magazine Revival</p>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>The film craze of 1932 stirred up countless film publications. This was indeed an unprecedented initiative in China! Now, we have received such news again.</p>
<p>The film magazine published by Lianhua has been discontinued for a long time. This time, Luo Mingyou returned from Southeast Asia and, seeing the current state of the Chinese film industry, felt that Lianhua needed to re-establish its official magazine. Therefore, he specially invited Su Yi, a screenwriter from the First Studio, to be in charge of planning everything. Thus, Lianhua's film magazine will soon be announced to be revived.</p>
<h3 id="e209">The Story of William Powell <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Ai</p>
<p>William Powell was born in Pittsburgh. He collected and kept many rubber bands and old hats. He has his own swimming pool, fills it with cold water every day, and then jumps in. He has more clothes than any other male star in Hollywood, and loves to co-star with Kay Francis. Although he is madly in love with Carole Lombard, he usually objects to (prohibiting) the word. He thinks there should be a law to restrict the misuse of (prohibition).</p>
<h3 id="e210">Beauties of the World <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>After Eric Charell finished performing *The Kid From Spain*, he selected sixteen of the most beautiful of the seventy-six dancers in this film, planning to follow the film around the world and perform everywhere. These sixteen selected dancers can be said to be the most beautiful people on the screen, because those seventy-six dancers were selected from more than nine thousand women.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Methods for Actors to Train Themselves <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>Here, I don't want to promote any kind of doctrine, nor do I plan to use a bunch of half-baked new terms to anesthetize the reader. I only feel that what the Chinese film industry urgently needs at present is new acting talent who can be original and not worship imitation.</p>
<p>Many people have already seen the importance of creating new talent, but who will create it? And what kind of creation method should be used? Hoping that the government will allocate public funds to establish a film school? No one dares to harbor such wishful thinking. If you expect film companies to take on this important task, that is also impossible. Because creating talent is not a profitable business. Therefore, even if a film company opens a training institute or training class or something similar, at most it will only save the film company from hiring extras. No film company would be willing to spend a lot of training fees to create talent for other film companies.</p>
<p>However, in the social news column of Shanghai newspapers, every year you can always find one or two cases of fraudulent financial gain under the guise of a film school. Each time, the number of students who are cheated is in the thousands or hundreds, you can know that, based on Shanghai alone, the number of people who hope to become movie stars is indeed not small. Counting the whole country, I don't know how many more there are. Among these many people, are there no talents to be made? It's a pity that they can't get proper research and practice methods. I am now using this space to introduce the various knowledge and methods of training oneself that movie actors must have, to these many enthusiasts who are unable to find a way in.</p>
