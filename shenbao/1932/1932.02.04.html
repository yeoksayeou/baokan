<p>時評</p>
<h3>國人應知此戰之關係重大</h3>
<p>彬</p>
<p>從去年九月十八東北禍變以至此次上海禍變是日帝國主義者對我積極侵略的整個計劃之實行它趁着世界不景氣的時機對於我國由經濟的侵略進而爲暴力的威脅一方面固足以顯示遠東隱伏的暗潮行將爆發而爲明爭而另一方面亦足以顯示日帝國主義者爲深重的不景氣所悶目前已臨到窮途不能不暴露其兇殘面目作最後一霎時的掙扎</p>
<p>上海爲我國的經濟中心與文化中心日帝國主義者威迫上海即所以扼我整個國家的咽喉置我全民族於生死綫上所以上海禍變不是上海局部的禍殃而實關係我整個民族之生存</p>
<p>此時任何人應都以革命的大衆武力反抗日帝國主義者的暴行才能挽救我民族的滅亡才能奪取我民族的生存自由忍耐與退讓即是坐待宰割而分崩離析不能協力對外尤爲自速滅亡一個民族尙不能堅固團結一致努力於抗暴禦侮徒希望友邦予我們以助力拯救我們的危亡這不僅是妄想且正是無血氣不自振作的怯弱行爲</p>
<p>上海禍變旣已爆發而且十九路軍與一切義勇軍的英勇將士已奮力應戰連日屢挫强敵使其志不得逞此時正爲我全民族總動員奮起抗日的最好時機我們認爲在此時期第一全國各地軍旅都應各自奮起對日應戰根本肅淸日本在華暴力第二馬占山將軍應即率師反攻肅淸一切叛軍第三張學良應即出師恢復東北失地給予東北各地艱苦作戰的義勇軍以實方援助第四各政治領袖應消弭意見和衷共濟一致努力於抗暴救亡第五全國民衆都應自起組織并自動武裝起來以前仆後繼的精神準備與暴日作持久的血戰</p>
<p>這次的戰爭具有深長意義是偉大的光榮的日前日外相幣原曾說『日本呑併满蒙如像呑下了一顆炸彈』爆發這顆炸彈想就在此時了</p>

<p>外交省表示除第五欵外或可接受　　東京日本答覆列强提議之文、展緩至明日提出、顯因重要國事、須先商諸元老西園寺、徴求其意見也、外相芳澤今日已往謁西園寺、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>紐約據東京消息、日外省發言人表示意思、以爲列强提出解决上海衝突之提議除第五欵外、或可爲日本所接受、並謂第五欵絕對不能接受云、查第五欵主張立即開始無條件之談判、以非載公約及十二月九日國聨議案之精神、及中立國視察員之襄助、解决一切懸案、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓頃悉英美駐日大使已將和平計劃送交日政府、該計劃含有下列諸點、㈠雙方停止暴力行爲㈡雙方勿再動員或作進攻準備、㈢所有各接觸地點之作戰人員各自撤退、㈣設立中立區域、保護公共租界、㈤此項辦法接受之後、雙方應即遵從非戰公約之精神、進行談判、永久解决各項懸案、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>華盛頓國務院對於英美法意四國、共同向中日兩國建議停止敵對行動一事、深信其能生效力、一般人以爲日本對四國建議、甚難拒絕、因此項建議之原動者、係屬日本故也、華盛頓昨日又向東京政府進行交涉、白宮方面宣稱、美國海陸軍隊僅在保護上海美僑之生命財產、但美國對於中日兩國所有爭執之重要問題</p>
<p>、極願出而幹旋以求解决、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>美總統</p>
<h3>擬定和平方案</h3>
<p>俟獲英相同意後提出</p>
<p>駐滬日海軍司令更調</p>
<p>足證日本已自承有過</p>
<p>紐約胡佛總統已擬定一種「和平方案」、擬在和平討論中估計中日爭案之過失不作恫嚇或命令、惟在國務卿史汀生由電話商諸英相麥唐納之前、不欲提出、紐約講壇導報華盛頓訪員謂、日本未以惡態接受中之一建議、故尙可希望其接受和平計畫中之要點、紐約時報謂如日政府拒絕英美之計畫、則在世人之目光中、將更貶其聲望、而發生重大危險、該報又謂日政府將野村海軍司、令調往上海、足證其自承有過、準備淸理其投機事業云、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>紐約日本駐滬海軍司令頃已更調、因之華盛頓方面對於中日爭端之樂觀、印象愈爲有力、紐約泰晤上報載稱日本駐滬海軍司令更動之舉、足證日本自知謬誤、並準備將時局予以結朿、美國海軍作戰事務局局長潑拉脫提督以爲日本駐滬海軍司令調動之事、足使時局感受良好影響、但上海多數中日國人持有槍械而運動不當仍屬危險所在云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>紐約據華盛頓消息靈通者言、胡佛總統上項計畫、雖由其他各國贊助、但係美國獨立行動、設若被人拒絕、其責任仍由美國担負、各報以爲雙方交戰國對於和平計畫、非無所動於中、民聲論壇報載稱、日本對於中立國之建議、尙非拒而不納、則和平提案之主要點、或當爲所認可紐約泰晤士報載稱、日本若果拒絕和平提案、其在世界之聲望必爲之减色云云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>日人逞暴</p>
<h3>喪失世界同情</h3>
<p>倫敦泰晤士報今日社論、謂外相西門所報告之遠東政策、定爲英國輿論所贊同、今公共所要求者、僅在以必要的毅力、實行此政策耳、美國反對日本過分行爲之輿情、現較英人爲甚、日本現須知其在華海陸軍代表之行爲、已漸使全世界輿情反對其國、日本今已喪失其前所享受之許多擁護矣、日人交戰者在上海之種種不規則行動、已表示基遠不合於文化之高程度、從前世人對於新日本、稱爲有文化高程度、今則對於日本漸失同情、此乃與最後解决不能無影響者、上海解决較諸满洲尤須爲國際性質之解决、除日本外、各國在絕大貿易中心點之上海、威有極大的固有利益、斷不能消極、而聽日本以暴力造成一種特惠局勢也云、（二日路透社電）</p>

<p>羅馬羅馬特利布那報評論遠東時局謂上海南京事件、不能如满洲之忽視、日本攻擊寗滬兩處、簡直攻擊另一國家、故此問題乃與當地有關係各國之問題、而非以舉動紆緩事、後追論爲手續之國聨問題云（二日路透社電）</p>
<p>柏林各報關於遠東事變之評論如下、中央黨機關報日耳曼報要求國聨會迅速調處以冀挽回和平之最後幸運又謂遠東事變明白表現軍備過强所搆成之危險、因如此則强者可以其力量而壓制弱者也、佛郎克孚日報謂日本加於中國之軍事行動實爲一種嚴密計畫方今歐洲及美國正爲政治及經濟變動所困、不能以有效主法加以干涉、日本政府乃乘此時機以實施其計畫云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>The People of the Nation Should Know the Importance of This Battle</h3>
<p>By Bin</p>
<p>From the Manchurian Incident of September 18th last year to the current Shanghai Incident, this is the implementation of the Japanese imperialists' overall plan for aggressive invasion of our country. Taking advantage of the global economic downturn, they have moved from economic aggression to violent threats against our country. On the one hand, it is enough to show that the undercurrents hidden in the Far East are about to erupt into open conflict. On the other hand, it is also enough to show that the Japanese imperialists are suffering from a deep economic downturn and have reached a dead end, and have no choice but to expose their ferocious face and make a final desperate struggle.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of our country. The Japanese imperialists' coercion of Shanghai is to strangle the throat of our entire country and place our entire nation on the line of life and death. Therefore, the Shanghai Incident is not a local disaster for Shanghai, but is actually related to the survival of our entire nation.</p>
<p>At this time, everyone should resist the Japanese imperialists' atrocities with revolutionary mass armed force in order to save our nation from extinction and seize the freedom of our nation to survive. Tolerance and retreat are tantamount to sitting and waiting to be slaughtered and disintegrated. Failure to cooperate with each other against foreign enemies will only accelerate our demise. A nation that cannot be firmly united and make concerted efforts to resist violence and defend against insults, and merely hopes that friendly nations will give us assistance to save us from danger, is not only a delusion but also a cowardly act of lacking vigor and self-reliance.</p>
<p>Now that the Shanghai Incident has broken out, and the heroic soldiers of the 19th Route Army and all volunteer armies have fought bravely to resist the strong enemy and frustrated their ambitions for days, this is the best time for our entire nation to mobilize and rise up to resist Japan. We believe that during this period, first, all military forces throughout the country should rise up to resist Japan and fundamentally eliminate Japanese violence in China. Second, General Ma Zhanshan should immediately lead his troops to counterattack and eliminate all rebel forces. Third, Zhang Xueliang should immediately send troops to recover the lost territory in the Northeast and provide practical assistance to the volunteer armies fighting hard in various parts of the Northeast. Fourth, all political leaders should eliminate their differences, work together harmoniously, and strive together to resist violence and save the country from destruction. Fifth, the people of the whole country should rise up to organize and arm themselves spontaneously, and be prepared to engage in a protracted bloody battle with the violent Japanese with the spirit of advancing wave upon wave.</p>
<p>This war has profound significance and is great and glorious. The Japanese Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara once said, "Japan swallowing Manchuria is like swallowing a bomb." It seems that the explosion of this bomb is at this time.</p>

<p>Agreement Reached That Neither Side Should Open Fire Without Cause</p>
<p>Nanjing, 11:00 AM on the 3rd. Japanese Captain Tange and Naval Attaché Aonuma invited He Guoguang, Deputy Commander of the Garrison, by phone to invite Fan Hansheng, Section Chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Wang, Representative of the Ministry of Military Affairs, to come to the Japanese warship again for talks, so that the matters discussed on the 2nd could be further improved. Immediately, Fan went to the Xiaguan Naval Wharf to wait for Wang. Accompanied by Wang, he took a small boat to the Japanese warship to discuss everything. (Special Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Nanjing, this afternoon, Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin told guests that the Chinese military strength in Nanjing is sufficient to maintain law and order and protect foreigners. Foreigners here need not worry about safety. He is able to guarantee everything. He also said that the Japanese navy stationed in Xiaguan is overly sensitive, which can be proved by one incident. Yesterday afternoon, someone committed suicide by jumping into the river. The people gathered on the riverbank to watch a small boat rescue the drowning person. The Japanese naval commander, seeing this, immediately ordered all warships to prepare for battle and notified the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that Chinese soldiers on the riverbank had mounted machine guns and artillery to attack Japanese warships. He has ordered the military police in Xiaguan and Pukou to prohibit the people from gathering on the riverbank to avoid misunderstandings, and has also notified the Japanese naval commander that the Chinese army will never attack Japanese warships. (Reuters Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Nanjing, this afternoon, Chinese and Japanese authorities held a meeting on a Japanese warship in Xiaguan to agree that neither side should open fire without cause. Because of this, people's hearts have been stabilized. The Chinese attendees were three members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who could speak Japanese and one representative of the Ministry of Military Affairs. The Japanese representatives were the Japanese Consul General in Nanjing and the Japanese naval commander. (Reuters Telegram on the 3rd)</p>

<p>Nanjing, U.S. Minister Johnson and British Chargé d'Affaires Ingram visited Luo Wengan and Song Ziwen on the 2nd one after another, conveying the hope of the British and Americans that the military conflict in Shanghai should be stopped. Luo stated that China was only limited to self-defense and that if the Japanese side did not advance, China would never attack first. Then, Johnson and Ingram went to the French Consulate to meet with Consul-General Madano to exchange views, and are still waiting for the parties involved in Shanghai to agree.

<p>Nanjing, British Minister Lampson was originally scheduled to arrive here this morning, but due to military operations on the Jinpu Railway, the train was blocked in Xuzhou for some time and is expected to arrive tonight. According to reliable sources, Minister Lampson has received an urgent telegram from the British government, ordering him to go to Shanghai immediately. (Reuters Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Nanjing, yesterday, the Chinese aviation pilots took photos of themselves and wrote their wills, expecting that they would soon be called upon to sacrifice their lives for the country. People's hearts here are very tense, but the news that Britain, America, France, and Italy are taking joint action to stop the war has brought some comfort. People generally hope that the war can be stopped as soon as possible, and that the powers will eventually take concrete measures to uphold the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated this morning that China has replied to the lengthy document from Britain and the United States, accepting all of its proposals. This morning, Japanese warships moved upstream, and Chinese gunboats moved downstream, about seven or eight miles apart, while American and British warships were moored in the middle, making a clash between warships impossible. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. stated that from today onwards, Jardine Matheson ships will not carry passengers to Shanghai because the situation in Shanghai is dangerous. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told a Reuters reporter that the Chinese government welcomes any action to stop the war and uphold the rights and obligations of international treaties.

<p>The Powers' Proposal to Resolve the Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Japan Has Not Yet Replied</h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Consults Saionji</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Indicates Acceptance of All But the Fifth Clause Tokyo, Japan's reply to the powers' proposal has been postponed until tomorrow, apparently because of important state affairs that must be discussed with elder statesman Saionji to solicit his opinion. Foreign Minister Yoshizawa has already visited Saionji today. (Reuters Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>New York, according to Tokyo sources, a spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed the view that Japan could accept the proposal put forward by the powers to resolve the Shanghai conflict except for the fifth clause, and said that the fifth clause was absolutely unacceptable. The fifth clause advocates the immediate commencement of unconditional negotiations, with the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League of Nations resolution of December 9th, and the assistance of neutral observers, to resolve all outstanding issues. (Reuters Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington, it is learned that the British and American ambassadors to Japan have sent a peace plan to the Japanese government. The plan contains the following points: 1) Both sides cease violent acts; 2) Both sides no longer mobilize or prepare for attack; 3) The combatants at all points of contact retreat; 4) A neutral zone is established to protect the Public Concession; 5) After accepting this plan, both sides should immediately conduct negotiations in the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact to permanently resolve all outstanding issues. (National Telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington, the State Department is confident that the joint suggestion of Britain, America, France, and Italy to China and Japan to cease hostilities will be effective. People generally believe that Japan will find it difficult to reject the four-nation suggestion, because the originator of this suggestion is Japan. Washington yesterday also conducted negotiations with the Tokyo government. The White House declared that the American army and navy are only protecting the lives and property of American citizens in Shanghai, but the United States is extremely willing to come forward and mediate on all important issues of dispute between China and Japan in order to seek a resolution. (Havas Telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo, according to responsible sources today, Japan welcomes a cessation of hostilities, but if it is necessary to unconditionally accept the fifth clause of the powers' proposal, then it cannot agree, because the fifth clause is absolutely impossible. It is expected that Japan's reply will unconditionally accept the first four clauses and plainly reject the fifth clause. The wording of the reply is roughly as follows: First point, both sides cease violent acts, which can be accepted if China also ceases violent acts; second point, no longer prepare for hostile acts, Japan cannot make this promise unless it is clear about the sincerity of the Chinese authorities regarding this clause; third point, the Chinese and Japanese combatants withdraw from all points of contact within Shanghai, Japan will declare that it is impossible to withdraw Japanese sailors from the areas where Japanese people live unless the Chinese soldiers retreat to a "safe distance"; fourth point, establish a neutral zone, Japan may suggest a permanent agreement stipulating that Chinese soldiers must not enter sections of land a certain distance from the public boundary; fifth point, immediately commence unconditional negotiations to resolve all outstanding issues, Japan will under no circumstances allow a third country to participate in Chinese-Japanese negotiations involving the Manchurian case.

<p>U.S. President</p>
<h3>Formulates Peace Plan</h3>
<p>To Be Presented After Gaining British Approval</p>
<p>Japanese Naval Commander in Shanghai is Replaced</p>
<p>Sufficient Proof that Japan Has Admitted Its Wrongdoing</p>
<p>New York, President Hoover has formulated a "peace plan," intending to assess the faults of the Chinese-Japanese dispute in a peaceful discussion, without intimidation or orders. However, he does not want to present it until Secretary of State Stimson discusses it with British Prime Minister MacDonald by telephone. A Washington correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune said that Japan has not accepted one of China's suggestions in a bad manner, so there is still hope that it will accept the main points of the peace plan. The New York Times said that if the Japanese government rejects the British-American plan, it will further diminish its reputation in the eyes of the world and cause serious danger. The newspaper also said that the Japanese government's transfer of Naval Commander Nomura to Shanghai is sufficient proof that it has admitted its wrongdoing and is preparing to clear up its speculative affairs. (Reuters Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>New York, the recent replacement of the Japanese naval commander in Shanghai has strengthened the optimistic impression of the Chinese-Japanese dispute in Washington. The New York Times reported that the action of changing the Japanese naval commander in Shanghai is sufficient proof that Japan knows it is wrong and is preparing to end the situation. Rear Admiral Platt, Director of the Bureau of Naval Operations, believes that the transfer of the Japanese naval commander in Shanghai will have a good impact on the situation, but it is still dangerous that many Chinese and Japanese people in Shanghai hold firearms and do not move properly. (Havas Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>New York, according to informed sources in Washington, although President Hoover's plan is supported by other countries, it is an independent American action. If it is rejected, the responsibility will still be borne by the United States. Newspapers believe that the warring countries are not indifferent to the peace plan. The Public Opinion Forum reported that Japan has not rejected the suggestions of neutral countries, so the main points of the peace proposal may be recognized. The New York Times reported that if Japan rejects the peace proposal, its reputation in the world will be diminished. (Havas Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>British Parliament</p>
<h3>Discusses the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>British Foreign Secretary States Methods for Mediating the Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>Lansbury Denounces Japan as an International Robber</p>
<p>London, the British Parliament reopened today after the Christmas recess, with many attendees. It is expected that there will be speeches in the assembly regarding the recent situation in the Far East. British Foreign Secretary Simon read a document, saying that Britain and the United States have taken the lead in trying to resolve the Far East storm and have now presented five methods to the Chinese and Japanese governments through diplomats, urging them to accept them. Simon detailed the events that occurred in Shanghai on the night of January 28th, and the plan of the British and American Consuls General in Shanghai to establish a neutral zone between the Chinese and Japanese armies, and mentioned that Britain had sent reinforcements to Shanghai, and that Britain had been closely consulting with other related countries. He continued, "What I must continue to say now is that the British government has issued instructions to its representatives in China and Japan, instructing them to submit the following proposals to the Chinese and Japanese governments this morning, urging them to accept them. This proposal has been agreed to by the U.S. government, and the French and Italian governments have been informed that they will do the same at Britain's request. The content of the British proposal is as follows: 1) Both sides cease violent acts; 2) No longer prepare for hostile acts; 3) The Chinese and Japanese combatants withdraw from all points of contact within Shanghai; 4) Establish a neutral zone, guarded by neutrals, to protect the Public Concession, the arrangements for which will be made by local consular authorities; 5) Immediately commence unconditional negotiations, in the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League of Nations resolution of December 9th, and with the assistance of neutral observers, to resolve all outstanding issues." British Prime Minister MacDonald, in answering questions from opposition leader Lansbury, did not advocate discussing this matter in the current environment. Lansbury claimed that Japan is currently engaged in "international robbery." As soon as this statement was made, the government party clamored, and the Speaker stopped him and told Lansbury not to forget that what he was saying was about a friendly country, but Lansbury refused to back down. Then the Prime Minister said, "Lansbury has proved that debate is not appropriate." Tonight, the British Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary, Secretary of the Army and Navy, and Chief of Staff discussed the latest report. London insurance companies have not yet received a large number of compensation claims for property losses within Shanghai. Although there are many inquiries, insurance companies are now very cautious and do not accept property insurance business outside the Public Concession. Property insurance outside the Public Concession is almost considered uninsurable. It is reported that the property insurance rate within the Concession has risen from 3% to 5% per month, while in peacetime it is only 6 pence per 100 pounds per year.

<h3>London</h3>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Simon and U.S. Secretary of State Stimson discussed the latest news about the situation in China by transatlantic telephone tonight. Labor Party leader Lansbury, who advocates economic sanctions against Japan, is said to have decided not to raise the issue of Japanese military action at the House of Commons meeting tomorrow. Members of the House of Commons, in order to maintain an impartial attitude, do not want to discuss the situation in detail. (Reuters Telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>London</h3>
<p>After the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs answered questions in the House of Commons regarding the current military situation in Manchuria, a member asked, "What steps is the government currently taking to protect China, which should be protected from foreign aggression?" This question caused protests from the government party, and the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs did not answer it. (Reuters Telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>London</h3>
<p>When the House of Commons met this afternoon, it was inappropriate to discuss the Shanghai situation. Opposition leader Lansbury again asked about the overall situation in Shanghai, and Foreign Secretary Simon answered the recent situation, and said that the House of Commons Lansbury asked the House of Commons to give a thorough discussion of the Chinese-Japanese dispute an opportunity. The famous left-wing Labor Party member Maxton urged an immediate discussion of the Shanghai situation, and said that applying for an extension of the discussion was absurd. Simon replied that he had not received other news, and then reiterated his previous statement, saying that the discussion in the House of Commons could not benefit the complicated Shanghai situation.

<p>Rome, according to responsible sources, Italy is now also sending warships to Shanghai purely for protection. The Italian ambassador to Japan has expressed to the Japanese government Italy's attention to the situation. It is said that the appearance of Italian warships on the Chinese seas is only a manifestation of this attention and not a protest. In addition to its commercial relations with China and Japan, Italy's only concern is the safety of its Italian people in China. The Roman Pope is also closely watching the situation and is deeply concerned about the many missionaries in China. (Reuters Telegram on the 2nd)</p>

<h3>Japan Has No Intention of Sending Reinforcements</h3>

<h3>Germany Notifies China and Japan</h3>
<p>Taking the Same Steps as Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Berlin, the German government has notified the Chinese and Japanese governments today regarding the Chinese-Japanese dispute. Germany will support the actions of European and American countries, but has not mentioned the proposal for a neutral zone in Shanghai, because Germany has abolished consular jurisdiction. (National Telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin, the German notifications to China and Japan were issued last night and copies were sent to the Council of the League of Nations. First, Baron Werrinck, the German representative to the League of Nations, telegraphed the German government about the steps that various countries intended to take. Prime Minister Brüning immediately convened a cabinet meeting and ordered the directors of the various departments of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to draft a notification, which was passed by the cabinet and issued immediately. The notification did not mention the proposal to establish a neutral zone in Shanghai, because Germany does not enjoy consular jurisdiction and does not have troops stationed in the Far East. Since the area will be defended by troops from other countries, Germany does not endorse the proposal. (National Telegram on the 3rd)</p>

<p>Japanese Use Violence</p>
<h3>Loss of World Sympathy</h3>
<p>Today's editorial in the London Times states that Foreign Secretary Simon's report on Far Eastern policy has been approved by British public opinion. The only thing the public is asking for now is to implement this policy with the necessary determination. American public opinion against Japan's excessive behavior is now even stronger than that of the British. Japan must now know that the actions of its army and navy representatives in China have gradually turned world public opinion against their country. Japan has now lost much of the support it previously enjoyed. The irregular actions of the Japanese combatants in Shanghai have shown them to be far from the high level of civilization. The world used to call the new Japan a highly civilized nation, but now the world is gradually losing sympathy for Japan, which will undoubtedly affect the final resolution. The Shanghai settlement must be of a more international nature than the Manchurian settlement. Apart from Japan, all countries have extremely large vested interests in Shanghai, a major trade center, and cannot passively allow Japan to create a privileged situation by force. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Although the Paris Disarmament Conference is the focus of today's Paris newspaper commentary, the Far Eastern issue is still not far behind. The comments in the Paris Echo state that the four-month patience of Britain and the United States towards Japan has now clearly ended. Neither country is willing to let things slide any further. Japan will now be taught a lesson and its objectives in China will be limited. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>The Rome Tribuna comments on the Far Eastern situation, saying that the Shanghai and Nanjing incidents cannot be ignored like Manchuria. Japan's attacks on Ningbo and Shanghai are simply attacks on another country. Therefore, this issue is a matter for the countries concerned in the region, and not a matter for the League of Nations, which is slow to act and reviews matters after the fact. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin newspapers commented on the Far Eastern incident as follows: The German Daily, the organ of the Center Party, called on the League of Nations to mediate quickly in the hope of saving the last hope of peace, and also said that the Far Eastern incident clearly demonstrated the danger posed by excessive armaments, because in this way the strong can suppress the weak with their strength. The Frankfurter Zeitung said that Japan's military action against China was a well-planned one, and that Europe and the United States were being plagued by political and economic changes and could not effectively intervene, so the Japanese government took this opportunity to implement its plan.

<h3>The Japanese Army's Combined Sea, Land, and Air Assault Fails</h3>
<p>The Japanese Navy Bombed the Wusong Fort Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Our Army Also Opened Fire in Self-Defense</p>
<p>Sunk a Destroyer and Damaged Three Warships</p>
<p>One of the Twelve Enemy Planes Dropping Bombs Was Shot Down</p>
<p>Our Army Repelled the Attacking Enemy Troops in Zhabei</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Japanese warships, together with marines and air force teams, fired and bombed the Wusong Fort and the Zhabei defense line. Our army bravely resisted and held on for several hours, firing more than a hundred shots. As a result, the enemy troops were unable to withstand it and retreated one after another. Our army won a great victory, sinking one enemy destroyer, damaging three warships, and shooting down one plane. Our losses were extremely minimal. The detailed battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Wusong</h3>
<p>Regarding the battle situation in Wu, ㈠ Report from the Fort At about 10:00 am on the 3rd, a Japanese warship came to the sea outside Wusong Port, followed by several other warships. When approaching our fort, the ship emitted four echo whistles. Our fort ignored it, and the ship opened fire and bombarded our fort. Commander Deng Zhenquan also said that the Japanese ship first provoked the war and opened fire. For the sake of self-defense, we ordered all the soldiers on the fort and personally commanded them to open fire and fight back. After fighting each other until 12:00 noon, an enemy destroyer was hit by our artillery shells in the chimney and steam pot. The ship's body tilted to the left and right, and it was about to capsize. The remaining warships approached the ship's left and right to support it, and still concentrated their firepower to bombard us. Our army also aimed at the target and attacked fiercely. After fighting until 12:00 noon, the destroyer was sunk by our army and three warships were damaged. One of the ships was severely damaged and was about to sink at the time. It was dragged away by the remaining warships, and the ships were unable to withstand it and fled outward, stopping at the sea about 80 nautical miles away. After the enemy ships retreated, the artillery fire stopped, but after a while, suddenly 12 enemy planes flew to the sky above our fort and dropped more than 30 heavy bombs. The 19th Route Army artillery team stationed near the fort immediately used more than 30 anti-aircraft guns and small steel guns, mortars, and machine guns to fire fiercely, and an enemy plane was shot down by our army and fell outside Baoshan City. The enemy planes dared not fly and fled to the east. After that, the enemy ships fired more than a hundred shots, and our losses were very minimal. ㈡ Report from our reporter At about 10:00 am on the 3rd, two enemy 26th Brigade destroyers sailed from Shanghai to the sea surface of Sanjia Water outside Wusong Port and joined two enemy ships originally docked there. First, they sounded the steam whistle indiscriminately, and then raised the red flag. They immediately opened fire and bombarded the north and south forts of the Wusong Fortress. Fortress Commander Deng Xin ordered the heads of the fort, Zhou Changqing and Chen Yuwen, and all the soldiers on the fort to return fire and fight the four enemy ships. At the same time, more than 20 enemy planes were all over the sky above the fortress, throwing more than 20 bombs. The largest bomb weighed 120 pounds, and the smallest weighed 40 pounds. The two forts were slightly damaged. However, all the officers and soldiers of the fort did not show any weakness. They opened fire to attack the enemy ships and used anti-aircraft guns to shoot down the enemy planes. At about 12:00 noon, one of the four enemy ships was hit in the vital part of the hull and sank immediately. The remaining three ships were also damaged to varying degrees, but they still concentrated their artillery fire to attack the fort. At the same time, another enemy plane was hit by our army's anti-aircraft guns and crashed south of Baoshan City. The two Japanese soldiers driving the plane were killed on the spot. The two sides bombed each other until about 1:15 pm. The three enemy ships could not withstand it and fled out of the fire line and sailed outside the port. The enemy planes also flew away. In this battle, when the fire was opened, the 19th Route Army stationed in Songjiang also helped in the battle along the river, and the morale was very high. The residents of Songbao fled to the countryside one after another. At that time, the order was quite chaotic. It is heard that Baoshan suffered slight damage, which is difficult to understand for a while. It is heard that the enemy ships are now in the Bailong Port area of Chuansha County outside the port. The fortress is now under strict guard. ㈢ Merchant ships witnessed the battle A certain ship of the British Northern Ocean Class sailed from Yanjin to Shanghai yesterday. At about 12:00 noon, the ship arrived at Wusong Port and sailed into the Huangpu River. When entering the port, it saw three Japanese 26th Brigade destroyers stopped outside Wusong Port, with their gun muzzles aimed at our fort, looking like they were firing cannons. The ship was greatly frightened when it saw this and hurriedly sailed in. Who would have thought that it would encounter three Japanese destroyers and gunboats sailing out of the Yangshupu River to Wusong when entering the Wusong port? When the Japanese ships met the ship, they immediately opened their engines. In less than five minutes, the three Japanese ships exiting the port fired three shots at our fort first, and the three Japanese ships stationed in Songjiang also fired three shots. Our fort also returned fire. For a while, the earth shook and the sky trembled. The ship hurriedly fled in, only seeing that a flagpole of the fort was broken, and nothing else was damaged. Then it was heard that one of the Japanese ships had been hit by our fort, the ship was on fire and smoking, and it sank immediately. It was also heard that two other Japanese ships had been hit by our fort, and the two Japanese ships fled with injuries.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Zhabei</h3>
<p>(Report 1) At about 12:00 noon yesterday, the Japanese army sent marines to attack our army's position in Zhabei from the Hongkou Garden and Tiantongan Station, using cannons. They fired more than 100 cannons. At the same time, there were also many military planes throwing dozens of bombs in the air. Our artillery immediately returned fire with more than 50 cannons and more than 100 mortars. The fierce battle lasted until about 5:00 pm, and the artillery fire gradually stopped. All the officers and soldiers of our line calmly responded to the battle without moving slightly. According to reports, our artillery shells all hit the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters and the enemy's battle line in the Disweilu Douleanlu Jiangwanlu area. The enemy's battle line was very chaotic and suffered heavy losses. Our battle line has not changed. Only many civilian houses were destroyed. (Report 2) At about 7:00 am yesterday (the 3rd), the Japanese soldiers in the Hongkou area launched an attack on our army's positions again. Our army returned fire for the sake of self-defense. At the same time, Japanese soldiers used nine planes to help in the air and threw bombs in Zhabei. Our army used anti-aircraft guns to bombard them, and the enemy did not succeed. It was learned that the Japanese soldiers had issued a general attack order yesterday, so they attacked our army's defense lines after dawn yesterday. For a time, the sound of gunfire and artillery fire was loud and intense, especially in Tiantongan Road. Our army used machine guns and mortars to sweep, so the Japanese soldiers never took a step beyond the Thunder Pond. The next was Qiujiang Road intersection. Because our army's defense engineering was extremely solid, the Japanese soldiers were bombarded and repelled by our army. The next was Baoshan Road Zhongxing Road and Fusheng Road. The Japanese soldiers charged several times, but they were defeated because of our army's brave resistance and dense rain of bullets. At about 2:50 pm, the Japanese planes were unable to take advantage of the fierce artillery fire of our army and retreated first. Before long, the sound of gunfire and artillery fire gradually ceased. Our army's defense line did not change at all. When the Zhabei area was in the midst of a fierce battle, two Japanese planes flew to the Zhenru area and were shot back by our army on Machen Road. The bombs they dropped did not explode. When the Japanese soldiers attacked our army's positions in the Zhabei area this time, according to the coolies who escaped from there, the Japanese soldiers took a skirmish line, about ten people in a team. It can be seen that their intention was to take the encirclement. There were ambushes, so the casualties were heavy. Our army also suffered losses. From 3:00 pm to 8:00 pm, there was no contact.</p>
<h3>Compilation of Information from All Parties</h3>
<p>The Battle in Bailong Port Yesterday afternoon at about 5:00 pm, several Japanese warships opened fire and bombarded our army's artillery team in the Bailong Port sea area of Chuansha County, Pudong. Our army's artillery team also returned fire, and the fierce battle stopped after about half an hour. According to the news from Wusong, between 5:00 pm and 5:30 pm, the sound of artillery fire was very intense in the Bailong Port area, with a total of about 80 shots, and then stopped.</p>

<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng received instructions from the National Government yesterday that the National Government has fully accepted the five mediation methods of the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy.</p>
<h3>Huang Bingheng Prepares to Go to the National Crisis</h3>
<p>Huang Bingheng, Commander of the National Government Aviation, telegraphed yesterday, saying that the air force officers and soldiers are preparing to go to the national crisis and are now waiting for orders, and the dispatch is not far away.</p>
<h3>Deng Zhenquan Expresses His Determination</h3>
<p>Deng Zhenquan, commander of the Wusong Fortress, has the greatest determination to defend against the violent Japanese this time. It is heard that in addition to constantly encouraging the soldiers, he has also moved all his family members to live inside the defense line of the fortress to show his intention to coexist with the fort.</p>
<h3>Part of the Japanese Army Has Retreated</h3>
<p>After being defeated by our troops, the Japanese marines and plainclothes agents retreated into the concession areas, still using the concessions as a shield to carry out various military actions and attack our army's front lines. The municipal government has lodged protests with the Public Works Bureau and the Japanese Consul, as reported in previous newspapers. The Public Works Bureau notified Mayor Wu by telephone yesterday afternoon that all Japanese marines on the north bank of the Suzhou River and the North Henan Road area have withdrawn. Furthermore, the marines stationed inside the Toyota mill west of Fenghuangdu were also persuaded to withdraw. According to another report, the marines originally stationed at the intersection of North Henan Road and Baoshan Road withdrew to the area of Laobazi Road and Fusheng Road yesterday afternoon to build defenses.</p>
<p>▲Diplomatic Corps' Dissatisfaction with Japan, the Continental Newspaper reported last night, that the Japanese Navy and Air Force launched a fierce offensive against the Wusong Fort on Wednesday morning at 11:30 AM. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, Japanese marines attacked Chinese soldiers in Zhabei again. The Shanghai International Diplomatic Corps considers this a defiance of the wishes of the world powers, a destruction of peace, and an act that harms the happiness of Chinese and foreign people. Consular officials declared that the actions of the Japanese soldiers are no longer limited to Shanghai alone. Although this kind of warfare has not been formally declared, the Public Works Bureau was holding a meeting while the events were taking place, and diplomatic representatives from various countries were also holding lengthy meetings with military leaders.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Army Boasts Arrogantly According to foreign sources yesterday, the Japanese military commander planned to launch a full-scale attack on Wusong and Zhabei on the evening of the third day, and planned that once Wusong and Zhabei were occupied, they would reject any conditions from our side and the mediation methods of countries like Britain, the United States, France, and Italy. If they could not occupy it, they would then negotiate mediation methods with various countries.</p>

<p>The Diswell Police Station will be abandoned today (the 3rd) at 2:15 PM.

<p>Military Officer</p>
<h3>Discusses the Course of Combat</h3>
<p>Xinshi News Agency reporter visited Division Commander Qu Shou-nian yesterday afternoon, who reported that Britain and the United States had offered to mediate, setting a deadline for the Japanese to respond to the proposal to withdraw troops. Yesterday marked the end of the deadline, but the Japanese side showed no intention of withdrawing troops and launched a fierce artillery attack on our army from last night (the 2nd). Even within the deadline, they were constantly firing and attacking. Mediation naturally failed. For the sake of self-defense, our army naturally sought appropriate resistance to the Japanese attack. The Japanese army wants to use the concessions as a base for combat. Our side sent a letter to the authorities of the Public Concession today (the 3rd), making a clear statement that since the Japanese army has broken the peace talks and is using the concessions as a base for combat, our side will not be responsible for any accidents involving the lives and property of foreigners within the concessions thereafter. Now, Britain and the United States have proposed four mediation methods. Whether our side can accept them depends on the situation. However, if the Japanese army can retreat to within the concession lines, our army can naturally retreat to a corresponding location. As for the security issue after both sides retreat, police from neutral countries will maintain order in the areas outside the boundaries, while Chinese police officers will maintain order within the Chinese boundaries. I express my support for this proposal. The Japanese army is extremely cunning and may not accept it, but our side will never show weakness. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a serious protest regarding the various outrages of the Japanese side. I, along with Military Commander Cai, etc., are providing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with opinions on negotiations for their reference. The Japanese army launched a large-scale attack today, and our army also returned fire, causing the Japanese to retreat in defeat. On the Wusong front, it is reported that our army sank a Japanese warship. Mr. Chen Mingshu went to the front lines with us the day before yesterday to inspect the combat situation and expressed encouragement to the soldiers for their brave resistance against Japan. Mr. Chen will personally go to the front lines to command when necessary, he said.</p>
<p>▲Weng Zhaoyuan Xinshi News Agency reporter visited Brigade Commander Weng yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, who informed me about the situation on the front lines. He said that since the consuls of Britain and the United States mediated a three-day ceasefire between the two sides, our army has respected the agreement and has not fired a single shot. However, the Japanese army took this opportunity to launch a large-scale attack. Our army still maintained strict defense and did not launch a counterattack. Until last night (the 2nd), the three-day deadline expired. The Japanese army not only had no sincerity in accepting mediation but also intensified its attack. With the failure of the mediation, our army had no choice but to make a proper resistance for self-defense, and there was a fierce battle last night. However, our army still did not attack. This morning (the 3rd) at 10:00 AM, the Japanese army in Zhabei launched a general attack in three directions, one on Baoshan Road, one at the intersection of Guangdong Road, and one at the intersection of Qingyun Road West and Baoxing Road, all led by mortars and machine guns. They first launched a fierce artillery attack on our army, and our army immediately returned fire with artillery. The Japanese army was repelled within a few minutes, but they continued to open fire with guns and machine guns on our army. Our army also used artillery to fight back. From 11:00 AM onwards, six teams of Japanese aircraft, three in each team, totaling eighteen aircraft, flew in the air, dropping bombs to assist in the battle. Many civilian houses were bombed and burned down in the area west of Qingyun Road to Baoxing Road. The fire is currently burning and is difficult to extinguish due to the lack of fire trucks to provide assistance. From last night until 3:00 PM today, this battle has been the fiercest. Our army suffered some casualties, and the Japanese army suffered many more casualties. Our army is still defending its original positions. If the Japanese army attacks again tonight, our army will resolutely counterattack with all its strength to show the spirit of our army. We have just received a report from Wusong, saying that Japanese warships attacked our army with artillery at 1:45 PM in an attempt to occupy the fort. Our army also returned fire with artillery and sank a Japanese warship. However, according to a report received by Division Commander Qu, two more ships were damaged later. It is heard that the remaining Japanese warships dared not attack and immediately moved away. However, Japanese aircraft randomly dropped bombs, destroying civilian houses and causing heavy losses. In addition to using anti-aircraft guns to shoot down the aircraft, our army is also planning other ways to deal with them. In short, this battle is to fight for the survival of our nation and to win glory for our country. Death can demonstrate the spirit of our people and is worthwhile, he said.</p>
<h3>British Army Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Commander-in-Chief of the Asian Fleet Can Arrive Today</p>
<p>The British government, concerned that the Japanese military operations endangered the safety of the concessions, specially dispatched the Hong Kong Infantry Field Artillery Regiment, transported by the cruiser HMS Berwick, to Shanghai. Sir Kelly, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy's Asian Fleet, also rushed to Shanghai from Hong Kong aboard his flagship HMS Kent. At approximately 9:00 AM yesterday morning, HMS Berwick arrived in Shanghai and immediately entered Wusong. The large contingent of army field artillerymen carried inside the ship immediately disembarked, and all military supplies were transported ashore in batches by barges, lined up on the Bund, and walked westward along Nanjing Road, stationed at designated locations, preparing to be dispatched to defend the concessions. It is heard that the flagship HMS Kent, carrying Commander-in-Chief Kelly, will also arrive in Shanghai today. The defense forces of the concessions have become extremely strong.</p>
<h3>US Flagship Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Navy Admiral Trainer Arrives Together</p>
<p>The Remaining Seven Ships Can Arrive This Morning</p>
<p>The US flagship USS Houston, along with a total of eight destroyers, transports, etc., set sail from Manila to Shanghai under orders. The flagship USS Houston, due to its faster sailing speed, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM and docked in Huangpu. US Rear Admiral Trainer of the Far East Navy arrived on the ship with 600 US Marines. US Consul General Cunningham and others boarded the ship to welcome them. The remaining seven destroyers, etc., can sail into the Huangpu River this morning.</p>
<p>The American Evening Post said that the US government plans to protect American nationals in Shanghai with sufficient military force, and does not want American nationals to leave the country at present or in the future, as American nationals have a duty to remain in Shanghai. The US government has this resolution and must negotiate plans to deal with all kinds of emergencies, but will absolutely not implement them unless the guards are badly defeated and forced to do so. Also, according to news, US Rear Admiral Trainer, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon (the 3rd) aboard the flagship USS Houston. US Consul General Cunningham and Colonel Hawk, commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, immediately boarded the ship to report on the situation in Shanghai and discuss everything. According to the regulations, Rear Admiral Trainer's position is higher than that of Rear Admiral Fleming, commander of the stationed defense forces. A week ago, the Public Works Bureau appointed Rear Admiral Fleming as commander of the Shanghai Garrison, but this position may now be succeeded by Rear Admiral Trainer. The marines carried by the Houston have already landed last night.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Kill Chinese</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Lodges Protest Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Culprits Should Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>Yesterday, the municipal government lodged a protest again with the Public Concession Public Works Bureau and the Japanese Consul General Kuramatsu Murai. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>▲Letter to the Japanese Consul Dear Sir, since the Japanese Navy Marines provoked our troops on January 28, Chinese citizens have been arbitrarily arrested, subjected to summary executions, or killed in part of the Public Concession, in the areas outside the boundaries and in Zhabei. According to reports, hundreds of people are still being illegally detained. Such violations of humanity and international law compel the mayor to lodge a serious protest. I am writing to request that you immediately instruct the commander of your country's navy to release them promptly and to severely punish the perpetrators of the above summary executions and killings in accordance with the law. In the future, please take responsibility for suppressing such incidents, and I hope to receive a reply. Sincerely, to Kuramatsu Murai, Japanese Consul General stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲Letter to the Public Works Bureau Dear Sir, this government has already lodged a serious protest with your bureau regarding the Public Concession authorities allowing the Japanese army to use the concession area as a base for attacking our country's army, and has not received a reply. In the past few days, we have repeatedly received reports that Japanese Navy Marines have repeatedly passed through the concession armed, reaching western Shanghai and other places, carrying out various military actions, endangering the lives and property of our people. The concession authorities, despite declaring neutrality beforehand and after our government's protest, still continue to indulge them, without effectively stopping them, which is surprising. I am therefore raising this protest again and seriously stating that all responsibility for everything that arises as a result will be borne by the concession authorities. Please investigate and reply. Sincerely, to McNaughton, Chairman of the Public Concession Public Works Bureau.</p>
<p>Various Organizations</p>
<h3>Protest to the Public Works Bureau</h3>
<p>Rescue the Tragic Situation in Hongkou</p>
<p>Withdraw the Japanese Garrison</p>
<p>▲War Zone Refugee Relief Association Xu Shiying and Zhu Qinglan, Standing Committee members of the Shanghai War Zone Temporary Refugee Relief Association, wrote to the Chairman of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau, saying: Dear Sir, for the sake of respecting humanitarianism, we respectfully inform you of the unspeakable hellish suffering endured by the tax-paying Chinese residents of Hongkou. The residents of Hongkou should, in principle, enjoy freedom of movement and freedom of association, just like those south of the Suzhou River. The initial deployment, which placed Hongkou and other areas under Japanese control, was because there were more Japanese people living there. However, we Chinese people should never lose the rights that all people in civilized countries should enjoy and that cannot be infringed upon in the slightest. The great suffering currently endured by the residents of Hongkou is enough to make even the gods shed tears. On one hand, the sound of artillery is incessant, and on the other hand, they witness their fellow compatriots being suspected by the Japanese army of being plainclothes agents, arbitrarily arrested and shot. On one hand, there is the danger of fire, so they are extremely terrified. Some families have been destroyed, and some properties have been lost and cannot be recovered. What crimes have the Chinese people of Hongkou committed to be trampled on by Japanese plainclothes agents and Japanese soldiers? Cases of missing Chinese people are constantly emerging, and the rampant acts of terror in the Japanese-controlled area make the world consider the neutrality of the concessions a great laughingstock. The General Secretary of this association, Li Zuxin, and the Director-General of your bureau, Jones, have been discussing this matter since the beginning of this week, demanding a fundamental solution that takes all aspects into account. Delaying it by even an hour will only increase the physical and mental suffering of the Chinese residents there. Foreign residents in Shanghai have dispatched warships and troops to China to protect their lives and property. This association, having learned of such an unprecedented and dangerous situation in Hongkou, is naturally driven by conscience to ask your bureau to use all means to completely eliminate this terrifying situation from its roots. This association will do everything in its power to cooperate with your bureau. We sincerely hope for an immediate response.</p>
<p>▲City Chamber of Commerce The City Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Public Works Bureau and the five Chinese directors, saying: Dear Sirs, Japanese soldiers occupy key areas of the concession as bases for attacking Chinese troops, violating the neutrality of the concession. This chamber has repeatedly lodged serious protests with your bureau on record. Now, it is found that this encroachment on neutrality is not only not stopped by your bureau, but is instead allowed to progress day by day, which is truly shocking. The Beishanxi Road and North Henan Road were originally designated defense lines, and separate troops were stationed there, not under Japanese jurisdiction. However, after the Japanese army failed to succeed in attacking Zhabei, for the convenience of military strategy, they also occupied the two sections of the defense line, and the troops originally stationed in those two sections were even allowed to transfer the defense by your bureau. It seems that for the convenience of its aggression, the Japanese are allowed to do whatever they want within the concession, without the slightest restriction. The public commercial area of all countries has been transformed into a Japanese fortress, creating a record unprecedented in the history of the concessions, and damaging the dignity and status of your bureau. Not only does your bureau not take effective measures, but it also caters to its requests in everything. For the sake of the safety of the lives and property of the Chinese people within the boundaries, this chamber has no choice but to ask your bureau again (please ask the Chinese directors to use their authority to the Public Works Bureau) to raise a serious protest, and should ask the bureau (hold the Public Works Bureau responsible) to send other troops to replace the defense, and order the Japanese troops occupying the area to withdraw quickly. This is the only duty of your bureau to preserve its treaty rights and cannot be shirked. As for installing barbed wire along the Suzhou River, the result is only to put the refugees in a dead end, with no way to escape, and it is of no use in preventing the Japanese army from intruding. Since the Japanese army has fully exercised its military authority within the boundaries, the installation of barbed wire does not restrict the Japanese army, but instead restricts the refugees. The importance of the matter is reversed, and there is nothing more to it than this. Your bureau (We hope that the Public Works Bureau) should demolish this installation as soon as possible so that when there is an emergency, the people within the boundaries can escape and not be suddenly blocked. Your bureau (We hope that the Chinese directors to the Public Works Bureau) should not hesitate to immediately grant their requests in order to take care of the lives of the people. Sincerely, to the Public Concession Public Works Bureau, the five Chinese directors of the Public Works Bureau.</p>
<p>Public Concession Police Committee</p>
<h3>Protests to the Japanese Authorities</h3>
<p>▲Demanding Restoration of Police Authority</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the Public Concession Police Committee sent a document to the Japanese Naval Commander yesterday (the 2nd), demanding that they stop using the concession as a source for operational actions and that in the future, within the concession, they should be subject to the command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Police Committee and should not engage in independent military actions. The wording was quite strict, stating that the Japanese marines must immediately cease independent actions in the areas within the concession where they are assigned to maintain security and order, and pointed out that the Japanese marines have far exceeded their authority and violated the operating rules of the Defense Committee. In addition, the Public Works Bureau also sent a document to the Japanese authorities, reiterating the position of the Defense Committee, and another letter to the Japanese Consul General, strongly demanding the restoration of all municipal powers, such as the fire brigade and police station in the Hongkou area, which should be restored to their authority immediately and without further delay.</p>
<h3>British and American Mediation of the Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>▲Focus Shifts to the Capitals of the Three Countries</p>
<p>▲US Consul Has Not Received Government Instructions</p>
<p>This newspaper's reporter visited the US Consulate yesterday to interview US Consul General Cunningham, but Mr. Cunningham had not returned from welcoming US Rear Admiral Trainer of the Far East Navy, so Deputy Consul March received him instead. When asked about the mediation of the Shanghai Incident, Mr. March replied that since the Shanghai Incident mediation plan drafted in Shanghai was not agreed to by the Japanese government, it has come to an end. The focus of the negotiations has now shifted to Washington, London, and Tokyo. This office has not yet received instructions from our government, so it can be said that there is no new development. Consul General Cunningham has also not met with Japanese Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, Japanese Consul General Kuramatsu Murai, etc., recently, he said.</p>
<h3>Information on the Shanghai Incident Investigation Team</h3>
<p>▲Consuls to Hold Meeting Today to Discuss Matters</p>
<p>▲Italy Sends Additional Warships to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Italian government has declared that it will take consistent action with Britain, the United States, France, and other powers on the Shanghai incident and will send additional warships to Shanghai to jointly maintain the security of the Public Concession. This correspondent visited the Italian Chargé d'Affaires and Consul General in Shanghai, Count Ciano, yesterday, who said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has always striven to maintain world peace and is particularly willing to cooperate with Britain, the United States, and other countries to eliminate the war in the Far East. He received a telegram from Rome this morning (yesterday) stating that a 10,000-ton cruiser and a torpedo boat, each carrying 2,000 soldiers, have been dispatched to Shanghai to jointly maintain the security of the Public Concession and are expected to arrive in about ten days. Count Ciano also said that regarding the League of Nations Shanghai Investigation Team, the consuls general of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, and other countries in Shanghai have held a meeting at the consulate yesterday (the day before yesterday) to establish the team, and have publicly elected himself as chairman and Haas as secretary-general. However, no specific discussions have been held on the various methods, and the first meeting is scheduled for tomorrow (today). Although US Consul General Cunningham is not a formal member, it is expected that he will attend as an observer to assist, he said.</p>

<h3>Foreign Newspapers Uphold Public Opinion</h3>
<p>▲Opposing Japanese Atrocities</p>
<p>▲Hoping to Prevent Tragedies The North China Daily News said,</p>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly received letters from impartial people describing the tragic situation in the Hongkou area, and reliable reports of actual encounters have also been received from time to time. Those who are severely affected cannot be regarded as anti-Japanese propagandists, and what they describe is the truth, which is truly tragic. The current situation is extremely complex, and this newspaper does not want to add to the complexity by discussing it further. However, since the Japanese authorities have expressed regret for the unrestrained behavior of some Japanese people, it is believed that they must have taken measures to prevent it. If they can further inform the public that their troops have received orders to abide by the conventions of preventing the tragic records of the past few days when dealing with ordinary people, then it will be even better.</p>
<p>▲Demanding the Recovery of Police Authority The American Evening Post said,</p>
<p>Today, the Public Works Bureau should publicly demand that the Japanese armed forces hand over the civilians arrested in the Public Concession to a properly organized court for interrogation, and not to be dealt with by the Japanese military court. Any civilian executed by order of the Japanese army or navy authorities can be called murder. In law and in morality, there can be no other term to describe it. The Japanese army should treat Chinese people or other foreigners in the same way as any ordinary people and should not have more rights to interrogate and punish them at will. This position should be made completely clear immediately. Today, people insist that they are not at war with China, but only in the event of war can a military court have the slightest legal and moral authority to control the lives and behavior of civilians. If it is a garrison, whether it is a Japanese or other country's army, it should immediately send civilians to the appropriate court for special trial after arresting them, and cannot be interrogated directly by the military court.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Demonstrated on the Roof of the Sassoon Building Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Photo by Li Zunyong)</p>
<p>Now, only the Japanese army regards itself as the law. On one hand, they insist that they are not fighting, but at the same time, they implement martial law regulations, that is, they try civilians in military courts. This barbaric behavior of the Japanese army, this one instance alone, is enough to demand their complete withdrawal from the concession and to return the administrative power of the areas currently patrolled by the Japanese to the Public Works Bureau. How much more are there other countless reasons that can be used to demand their withdrawal? If it is said that the Public Works Bureau's strength is not as good as the Japanese army, so it cannot fight for the legitimate treatment of civilians, it is also a hypocritical excuse. If the Public Works Bureau's demands are rejected, then Japanese soldiers and officers who commit summary executions must be regarded as robbers and treated as robbers. The world has never seen a self-respecting person who, merely because of the disparity in numbers, is willing to endure the violence of robbers like a docile sheep. Now, the police officials in the concession are all brave and loyal to their duties, so it is believed that the Public Works Bureau will be able to obtain sufficient strength to implement the laws it has promulgated, and these laws are issued for the people it protects.</p>
<p>Today</p>
<h3>Silver, Money, and Rice Businesses Open</h3>
<p>▲Resolutions of the Silver and Money Industry by the City Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce issued a special announcement yesterday to discuss the prior opening of the silver, money, and rice businesses: Since the outbreak of the war in Zhabei on January 28, merchants have expressed their animosity towards the Japanese enemy, and due to the disruption of transportation and the chaos of order, merchants have been unable to conduct business peacefully, resulting in a continued shutdown. To this day, the lives of millions of citizens in Shanghai have been deeply affected, and Shanghai, as the commercial hub of various ports, has also felt the inconvenience in circulation. This chamber has reviewed the above situation and resolved at the joint meeting of directors and supervisors on February 3 that all silver, money, rice businesses, and all industries related to the necessities of life for citizens in areas where local security can be maintained by the Chinese and foreign authorities should open for business immediately to take care of the people's livelihood. This announcement is hereby made.</p>
<p>The silver and money industry in this city, previously angered by the perfidious and provocative behavior of the violent Japanese, suspended trading for three days from January 29. The resumption of business was originally scheduled for February 1, but due to the expansion of the war zone and the obstruction of transportation, it was forced to continue the suspension. Yesterday, after joint discussions between the two parties in the silver and money industry, it was generally believed that it would be difficult to resume business in the current severe war and chaotic order. However, with the Lunar New Year approaching, if the market remains closed for a long time, the financial sector will stagnate, and people's hearts will be even more panicked. The colleagues in the silver and money industry are in an extremely difficult and dangerous situation, but in order to circulate finance and stabilize people's hearts, the general premise is to do their best to maintain the market. It was resolved to open for business today, and all banknotes, deposits, and various collections and releases will be handled as usual. However, it is hoped that all citizens will uphold patriotic enthusiasm and mutual assistance, so that the market can be maintained, and people's hearts will gradually become stable, so as not to be exploited by foreign aggression and cause difficulties for the financial community, it was said.</p>

<p>After 9:00 AM, three Japanese aircraft flew in the air, surveying the Caojiadu area in western Shanghai. After ten minutes, they dropped several bombs in a row. One bomb fell in front of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau. A child happened to be there, and half of his head was blown off. His brains splattered, and he died immediately. The scene was very tragic. Another bomb entered the Rue Bayle in the concession. The concession authorities plan to negotiate with them.</p>
<h3>Charitable Special Train Also Bombed</h3>
<p>National News</p>
<p>Reports from agencies state that local charitable organizations had previously agreed with the railway bureau to have a special train stationed at a certain station specifically to transport refugees out of the city.

<p>▲ Great Terror on New Gate Road Yesterday</p>
<p>At 2 PM, Japanese planes circled over the North Szechuan Road area, dropping more than ten bombs. Simultaneously, another bomb was dropped in the middle of New Gate Road, injuring several people. Order was disrupted instantly. Merchants and residents nearby closed their doors one after another. The New Gate Road police station, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched officers to investigate and reported the bombing situation to the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>▲ We Frightened Away [Japanese Aircraft] on the West Gate Side Yesterday</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM, three Japanese aircraft flew over West Gate Daji Road and were shot at three times by the police, causing them to speed away.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Aircraft Circling Over Sassoon House Yesterday</p>
<p>When Japanese troops dispatched aircraft to drop bombs over Zhabei yesterday afternoon, citizens were greatly panicked. Simultaneously, eight Japanese aircraft circled in the sky over the concession. Around 1 PM, the eight Japanese aircraft gathered directly over the highest rooftop of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road and circled for as long as half an hour before heading towards Zhabei. The noise of the engines was deafening. Chinese and foreign merchants and residents in the area fled in panic, deeply fearing that Japanese troops would irrationally drop bombs. Foreigners residing in the hotel also opened their windows to observe, with some hiding under beds or taking elevators downstairs to flee alone. Order along the Bund area was instantly chaotic. At the time, a photographer from this newspaper braved the danger and took a photo on the Bund, which will be published in today's newspaper.</p>

<p>Japanese Army Barbarity</p>
<h3>Massacring Our Compatriots</h3>
<p>▲ Rickshaw Puller Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>A rickshaw puller was passing near the Jiaxing Road police station when a Japanese soldier stabbed him in the back with a bayonet. Because the force was too great, the bayonet was deeply embedded and could not be pulled out. The Japanese soldier then fired another shot, killing him.</p>
<p>▲ Feng Zaimei</p>
<p>Feng Zaimei, from Jiangbei, 22 years old, was stabbed in the abdomen by a Japanese soldier while walking on Tiantong'an Road at around 8 AM yesterday morning. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment and is in critical condition.</p>
<p>▲ Thirteen Laborers</p>
<p>In front of the Nichihua Cotton Mill at Xiaoshadu, thirteen laborers were gathering and talking one evening when they were suddenly rushed by marines who stabbed and shot them indiscriminately, killing them all. Not one survived. They also dragged the bodies away. Subsequently, family members of the laborers risked their lives to go to the Japanese headquarters to request the return of the bodies, but were refused. By 6 PM the day before yesterday, eleven bodies of the laborers floated up in the Suzhou Creek in front of the Shengho Lung Oil Factory at Caojiadu Creek. They were claimed by their families.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Disregards International Law</p>
<h3>Shooting Red Cross Personnel</h3>
<p>▲ Two Rescue Team Members Severely Injured</p>
<p>Xue Zhenyi, captain of the Second Rescue Team of the Chinese Red Cross Society, led ten team members in a rescue vehicle at 9 AM yesterday morning to the front lines to assist wounded soldiers and refugees. They proceeded in two groups. One group went towards Fanwangdu Zhongshan Road to Qingyun Road front line. When they rescued more than forty wounded soldiers and civilians, they sent them to the Haig Road Red Cross General Hospital. The other group went to the vicinity of the Baoshan Road Commercial Press in Zhabei. When they approached the defense line, they were abruptly shot at by Japanese soldiers. Even though they were displaying the Red Cross flag, the Japanese army completely disregarded it. Those injured included the driver Wang Dunfu in the leg, team member Wang Zhifang in the left arm, and Ji Wenwei in the head, in extremely dangerous conditions. They were immediately sent to the Haig Road Hospital. It is reported that the Red Cross Society, in response to the Japanese army's disregard for international law, has already telegraphed the Geneva World Red Cross Headquarters yesterday, requesting that it inform various friendly nations to uphold justice.</p>
<h3>Japanese People's Ferocious Circumstances</h3>
<p>▲ Foreigners Witnessing Tragic Events – Greater Shanghai Evening Post Reports</p>
<p>The German couple, Mr. and Mrs. Pick, the Englishman, Mr. Clean, and the Ellis couple, along with their two children, all resided in Lincoln Lane, opposite the Hongkou Garden, and were trapped in the war zone for five days. They endured immense danger and only escaped on Tuesday. According to them, the sudden Japanese attack on Zhabei left them with no opportunity to evacuate. Although they had appealed to the Japanese authorities, it was to no avail. They repeatedly attempted to escape, but were either blocked by Japanese civilians disguised as thugs or chased back with guns by Japanese sailors. On Tuesday, because a neighboring house caught fire, they resolved to seek survival in the face of death. They hastily gathered what they could carry and rushed out through the smoke. They walked to the Japanese defense line with their hands raised. At that time, they were unsure whether their lives could be spared. Fortunately, they encountered a Japanese friend who helped them escape danger. Mr. Pick had been instructed by his national consul not to disclose any information to newspapers, so he refused to reveal the tragic scenes he had witnessed from his window. Mr. Clean had not yet met with his consul, but on Wednesday morning, he recounted one or two of the tragic events he had witnessed in the past five days, which were heartbreaking to hear. Mr. Clean said, "Corpses were strewn all over the streets, and many starving dogs were fighting over them. We fired shots to scare them away, but the dogs still did not disperse. We saw dark figures slinking into a room and setting it on fire. The Chinese people who ran out of the room through the smoke were immediately shot dead. Corpses lay on the ground, men, women, and children. Across the street, the wife of a Chinese shop owner was holding a baby and was about to leave the shop when she was struck down. The next day, she was seen still tightly clutching her child, lying on the ground groaning. Our Chinese servant then went out and carried her into a room to care for her. When we left, the mother and child were still alive. When Chinese people tried to move the bodies, they were shot dead by the Japanese with rifles and machine guns, leaving the corpses on the street for the dogs to devour. The Japanese are extremely cruel. When they encounter Chinese people, they beat, shoot, or kill them with bullets. Even children are not spared." A certain foreigner said, "I recognize some of the Japanese who committed violence as members of the Japanese team of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. They work in banks and commercial firms. I have had business dealings with them in the past, and they also know me. When they saw me carrying luggage and staggering away from the dangerous area, they mocked me in various ways." Foreigners who have resided in Hongkou for many years have never had any conflicts with the Chinese. When the incident occurred, foreigners felt a great lack of food. The Chinese neighbors risked danger to deliver rice, meat, and other food items to relieve us, and also sent coal for heating. Their great kindness is deeply appreciated. When the seven foreigners left their homes, they were surrounded by thick smoke from nearby houses, so they all believed that all their property had been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Troops Indiscriminately Detaining Chinese Police Officers</p>
<p>Since the defeated battle at the North Railway Station, the brutal Japanese have become even more jealous of the Chinese. They are also concerned that this military action is without justification. So, the day before yesterday evening, they conducted a large-scale arrest of bathers at the Hongkou bathhouse. At that time, traffic was cut off, and passersby were temporarily using the bathhouse as a temporary lodging. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the night, a large group of Japanese soldiers arrived and bound the bathers with hemp ropes, driving them to the Japanese military headquarters in Hongkou. Among them was Chinese police officer No. 1753 from the Huisi police station, who had gone to the bathhouse to bathe because he could not return home due to being off-duty, and was thus arrested by the Japanese soldiers. According to the police officer's account, the Japanese soldiers initially transported them by car to an area outside the headquarters where they saw a large number of Japanese soldiers who were dead, packed in hemp sacks, and being transported to Japanese ships. The police officer did not think much of it. Unexpectedly, Japanese soldiers then ordered them to change into Japanese clothing and ordered them to drink a cup of yellow, intoxicating wine. Fortunately, the police officer was alert and secretly spat out half of it, so he was still conscious. At that time, the Western police chief of the police station happened to pass by and he loudly called out to the Western police chief for help. Unexpectedly, the Western police chief, seeing that he was dressed in Japanese clothing, suspected that he was a Chinese person intentionally disguising himself to disrupt the Japanese rear, and refused to provide assistance. The police officer then explained his situation and pointed out the location where his uniform had been taken off, at which point he realized that it was true and negotiated with the Japanese to secure his release. However, the police officer had already drunk the intoxicating wine and was excessively frightened, so he was unable to walk. The Western police chief then called a passing car to take him out of danger. He was fortunate to escape disaster. At the same time, Chinese police officer No. 1789 from the Hongkou police station was also arrested and given intoxicating wine to drink. Although he has now been rescued, he is deeply poisoned and is currently being treated at the police station hospital. It is fortunate that the above two Chinese police officers did not suffer a tragic death. However, the number of other Chinese people who were harmed is quite large. It is said that the purpose of this action by the Japanese is to frame the Japanese, instigating the Japanese public to oppose our country's facilities.</p>
<p>▲ Forcing Chinese People to Wave Japanese Flags – Greater Shanghai Evening Post Reports</p>
<p>This morning (the 2nd), dozens of Chinese people were standing near Peng Road and Bazilu, holding Japanese flags. A Japanese person who was taking news photos photographed them. At that time, a Portuguese person happened to pass by and was stopped by Japanese soldiers who checked his pass. The Portuguese person was deeply surprised that the Chinese were openly displaying pro-Japanese sentiments. Upon closer inspection, he suddenly realized the truth. Several steps away, several Japanese sailors were pointing guns at the Chinese people, shouting "Wave the flags!"</p>
<h3>Maintaining Order in the Rear</h3>
<p>▲ Petition to Severely Punish Traitors Ma Shaoliang and Others Presented to the Military Authorities</p>
<p>Esteemed Generals Jiang, Cai, and Dai, Commanders of the 19th Route Army in Zhabei, and Commander of the Garrison: As the Japanese invaders commit aggression, your army bravely rises up to resist. All of our compatriots should share the same hatred and unite to resist the enemy. However, according to recent news reports, most people are providing food and drink to support your army in the rear, but there are also some unconscionable traitors who are supplying the enemy with food, cars, and other supplies, or are taking bribes from the enemy and disrupting public order. These traitors are clearly stipulated in the current Criminal Law, Chapter II, Offenses Against the State, Articles 107 to 120. It is requested that your army, on the one hand, inform the public, and on the other hand, instruct local administrative and judicial offices to investigate at any time. If anyone violates the various articles of the above criminal law, their guilt should be determined according to the severity of the circumstances and they should be severely punished according to the law to uphold national law and warn traitors. We hereby telegraph this report. Ma Shaoliang, Zhao Shutong, and Sheng Zhuosan respectfully bow.</p>
<p>▲ Be Cautious in Selling Inflammable Items</p>
<p>The New Medicine Industry Association yesterday sent letters to various pharmacies saying, "We have recently learned that the Japanese, either by falsely claiming to be representatives of organizations or by employing ignorant and treacherous people, are purchasing inflammable items such as alcohol from various pharmacies in order to disrupt public order. Their intentions are sinister and hateful. Therefore, we are specifically sending letters to various pharmacies, stating that during the wartime period, if anyone who is unfamiliar comes to purchase inflammable items such as alcohol, you should refuse to sell them in order to avoid future troubles. This is our sincere hope."</p>
<p>▲ Executing Rioters Who Commit Arson</p>
<p>The Sixth Regiment Headquarters yesterday captured three rioters who were being used by the Japanese to commit arson and looting. Two of them, Jiang Sansan and Lu Wennan, were looting from people's homes in the area of Gonghe Xin Road and Yongxing Road at 11 AM yesterday morning. One of them, Wang Chunrong, a native of Yangzhou, over 30 years old, was committing arson and looting in the Qingyun Road area at 2 PM yesterday afternoon. They were all discovered by soldiers of the regiment and taken to the regiment headquarters. After a brief interrogation, they were executed on the spot at 3 PM yesterday afternoon to prevent others from following suit.</p>
<h3>Missing Refugees</h3>
<p>▲ Four Boy Scouts – North China Daily News Reports</p>
<p>Four Chinese Boy Scouts from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce were dispatched by the Red Cross Hospital on Sunday morning to North Szechuan Road to rescue the families of refugees, and have been missing ever since. Their whereabouts are unknown. They were traveling in Public Concession licensed car No. 1789 at the time of departure. The hospital requested the assistance of US Consul General Cunningham and Japanese Consul General Murai on Sunday afternoon and sent an urgent telegram to the Geneva Red Cross Federation. Yesterday, they received a reply stating that they plan to immediately take steps to investigate their whereabouts.</p>
<p>Xu Weilu and Zheng Zhifang</p>
<p>Xu Weilu, 25 years old, from Cixi, Ningbo, resides at No. 1 Zhongyifang, West Zaoqiao, Chinese Territory. On January 29, the Zaoqiao was bombed by Japanese aircraft. Afterwards, he and his wife Zheng Zhifang went missing. If anyone knows of their whereabouts, please report to the Shengsheng Art Company, Deyuli, Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>Sun Guilin and Family</p>
<p>Sun Guilin and his family previously lived at No. 94 Yuanfuli, Baoshan Road, Zhabei. They were unable to evacuate on the day the Japanese army invaded. It is now believed that they have safely escaped. If relatives and friends in the concession have relocated, please immediately go to Mr. Xu at Xinji Foreign Firm, No. 3 Sanma Road, or call 11394 first so that you can come to discuss matters in person.</p>
<p>Xu Guo's Family</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society's Women and Children's Shelter took in a woman named Xu Guiying (also known as Ren Fenzi), from Gaozheng, 18 years old, who was employed as a domestic worker at No. 15 Baohuali, Tiantong Lane, Meng's residence. Her employer has returned to Ningbo due to the war and she has nowhere to go. She was taken in by the society's relief team. However, after arriving, she cried incessantly because she was separated from her mother, Xu Guo (also known as Xiao Zhuzi). If anyone sees her mother, please notify the society so that the mother and daughter can be reunited, which would be a great act of merit.</p>
<h3>Tense Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>▲ Work of the War Zone Refugee Relief Association</p>
<p>After various charitable and public welfare organizations in this city jointly initiated the Shanghai War Zone Temporary Refugee Relief Association, they established an office within the Renji Shantang. A few days ago, the first full executive committee meeting was held, and Pan Gongzhan was appointed to go to the front lines to connect with the rescue of refugees to safe areas, and personnel were also dispatched to nearby foreign ports to connect with the reception of refugees. A reporter visited Mr. Pan yesterday and asked about the progress of the work. He replied, "I dare not refuse the commission entrusted to me by the committee. I immediately arranged for my comrades from the municipal party to visit Zhabei and Zhenru twice on the 1st and 2nd. I saw the refugees in Zhabei, supporting the old and carrying the young. Personnel have been dispatched to provide relief. However, there are too many refugees, which makes it difficult to deal with. I immediately visited Brigadier General Weng Zhaoyuan and General Cai Tingkai, who showed that if all sectors could resettle the refugees as much as possible so that they would not be displaced, and could recruit volunteers from the fire brigade to engage in firefighting, it would be no different from assisting the 19th Route Army. Brigadier General Weng expressed his concern for the people everywhere, and we should be even more motivated. After returning, I immediately discussed with Ma Shaoquan, the president of the Mineral Ash Factory Association, and obtained his permission to borrow five to ten trucks for transporting refugees. In the past few days, several trucks have been dispatched, transporting no less than several thousand people to the concession, temporarily settling them in various shelters. On the one hand, the concession is not a safe zone and the number of people is too large, making it difficult to accommodate them all. Therefore, we discussed with the Temporary Relief Association and sent letters and telegrams to the governments and chambers of commerce of Songjiang, Qingpu, Jiading, Jiashan, Kunshan, Changshu, and other counties, urging them to immediately prepare to set up reception facilities locally, and Shanghai can subsidize them if funds are insufficient. Party members have been dispatched to contact them. At the same time, we have asked the joint office of various bureaus of the municipal government to obtain the consent of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau to provide two free passenger cars for poor refugees on each train starting from today, which can accommodate about 1,000 people, to transport them to various places along the line. Therefore, we have also requested all the old colleagues of the Social Affairs Bureau to work together to first solicit volunteers from various shelters in the city to go to other ports and transport them to the South Railway Station by truck, and then continue to transport refugees to Zhabei, hoping to save more people from danger. But in Zhabei, I personally saw many refugees walking along the railway towards Nanxiang. It is hoped that the municipal government and all sectors will further consult with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to add two or three free cars for poor refugees on each train in Jiading or Nanxiang for relief purposes. The shelters are currently waiting for funds to be raised and have not been able to provide as much food as possible. In short, now is the time of national crisis. All our compatriots must be mobilized in spirit and materially to cope with it. And for this kind of work, we especially hope that all sectors will work together and have a central planning agency so that the results will be greater."</p>
<p>▲ Red Cross Relief Work (Investigate the Abuse of Red Cross Flags and Emblems)</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society discovered a case a few days ago in which someone was soliciting donations outside in the name of the Chinese White Red Cross Society and immediately sent people to investigate. As a result, a man named Huang Boyuan was found holding a donation book and flag and was taken to the association. Huang Boyuan knelt and kowtowed, begging for forgiveness and vowing never to spread rumors outside again, so he was released. Yesterday, another incident was discovered in which a cargo truck with license plate number 4561 was displaying the flag. The association's doctor Li Zhishang took the flag back. The woman in the car wept and said that she had purchased it for five yuan, so the flag was taken back and she was allowed to leave. The association stated that due to repeated discoveries of spreading rumors, it has now decided to cite Article 28 of the International Red Cross Convention and will detain and send to the police any person who encounters this flag again, charging them with the crime of illegally using military emblems. (Refugee Soldiers on Zhongxing Road) Hai Zongqi, captain of the First Rescue Team of the Chinese Red Cross Society, reported that he rescued more than a dozen refugees and several soldiers from the Sixth Regiment of the 78th Division, including Luo Caitang, Gu Qing, and Wu Lai, from the area of the Anhui Guild Hall on Zhongxing Road at 10 AM today, as well as several common people, including Zhang Wu, Tao Jingsan, Chen Yu, and Lin Yan. (Work of the Sixth Rescue Team) The Sixth Rescue Detachment of the Chinese Red Cross Society, led by captains Yu Songyun and Jiang Yisheng, set off at 7:30 AM yesterday morning, going directly to Baoyulu and rescued wounded soldiers Chen Gaozhong, leg injured in bombing, Chen Chunsheng, corner of the eye injured in bombing, refugee Chen Jiutang, head injured in bombing, Zhang Yang's family, postpartum Hua Haoquan, leg injured by bullet, bullet not removed, Wang Agen, cold, Zhu Asi, cold, Ji Afu, cold, Zhu Junping, minor injury, and Lu Guanghe, minor injury, all treated at the Fifth Rescue Hospital. It was also heard that Mr. He Wuliang had raised 500 yuan from the Shanghai Business Club, 123.20 yuan from the tenants of Tongfuli on Jing'an Temple Road, and Mrs. Zhang had donated 30 blankets and an anonymous donation of 30 shih of white rice, all of which were generously donated to the hospital. (Rescue worker injured) Wang Dunfu, a rescue worker of the Red Cross Society, was struck in the head by a stray bullet while rescuing wounded soldiers and refugees on Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, at about 10 AM yesterday morning and fell to the ground immediately. Liu Zhongying and Wu Ban'an, commanders of the Municipal Federation Rescue Team, drove up and immediately sent him to the Haig Road Red Cross Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. At the same time, they rescued six refugees and escorted them all to the Mainland Commercial Center Refugee Shelter.</p>
<p>▲ Work of the Red Swastika Society Rescue Team</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the First Team of the Southeast United Relief Team of the Red Swastika Society divided into two groups and drove two ambulances from Maigen Road to the Zhongxing Road area to carry out rescue operations. They rescued a wounded civilian, Yu Acheng, and took in 160 refugees, then turned back. While driving, they heard the sound of a bomb, so they inquired and went to North Sichuan Road, where they rescued six people: Zhu Gao's family, Gu Baocheng, Chen Dexing, Zhi Yixing, Yang Bingrong, and Yang Fengxiang. One person, Zhu Gao's family, was slightly injured and sent to the Red Cross Hospital. The rest were sent to the society's temporary hospital in Xieqiao for treatment. The second group set off one after the other after the first group set off, and went to the Datong Road and Gonghe Road area, taking in more than 200 refugees. Together with the first group, a total of more than 360 refugees were sent to the society's shelter. The third group set off in the afternoon and rescued three injured civilians in Xieqiao: Gu Xuezhi, Gu Baohe, and Hu Baoan. Because the injuries were too severe, they were sent to Baolong Hospital. The hospital was already full, and surgery was required, so it was inconvenient to accept them, and they were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The society's temporary shelter in Zhabei is located at Yuchengli, at the intersection of Hengfeng Road. From time to time, it receives refugees, who are then transported from there to the Shandong Guild Hall. Director Guo Jing, Mr. Xia Zhongguang, and Mr. Jiang Zhongliang of the society, and Mr. Xia Wuche of the society, took in more than 300 refugees in Zhabei and negotiated with the military to have a covered railway car transport the refugees to Nanxiang and Suzhou for resettlement.</p>
<h3>The City Council Continues to Set Up Three Shelters</h3>
<p>The City Council's United Rescue Team, led by Liu Zhongying and Wu Ban'an, dispatched team members to the Zhabei area yesterday and rescued approximately 1,000 refugees. Wang Dunfu, a Red Cross rescue worker who had his head wounded by a stray bullet, was rescued on Baoxing Road and taken to the Haig Road Red Cross Hospital for treatment. The original six shelters were extremely crowded, so three new houses, Nos. 61, 63, and 65 Ren'anli, Guling Road, were added as the seventh, eighth, and ninth shelters. There are still refugees coming to the shelters in a steady stream. It is feared that the food supplies on Shanyin Road will not be sufficient, and it is hoped that enthusiastic compatriots will donate to the best of their ability.</p>
<h3>The Disaster Relief Association Lacks Trucks</h3>
<p>The</p>
<p>City of Yunnan Road Renji Shantang War Zone Disaster Relief Association has been going to the war zone to rescue refugees for days and has been working hard. However, it feels that there is a lack of vehicles, making transportation difficult, and it is unable to rescue disaster victims to the greatest extent possible, which is deeply regrettable. It is hoped that all sectors will be able to donate trucks to fulfill the grand aspiration of benefiting all beings.</p>
<h3>The Guangdong Fellow Villagers Comfort Association Has Been Renamed</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Fellow Villagers Comfort Association was originally a group for the rescue and shelter of fellow villagers fleeing the disaster. Since February 2, it has been operating under the name "Guangdong Fellow Villagers Relief Association" to better reflect its original purpose.</p>
<h3>The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association Rescues Fellow Villagers</h3>
<p>Most</p>
<p>of the people from Ningbo residing in the Zhabei area are. The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, seeing that the fellow villagers in that area were fleeing the disaster one after another, immediately set up a shelter at the Siming Public, taking in more than 500 people in three or four days. On the one hand, they made efforts to add extra sailings on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, including the Wanxiang, Tunan, Jiahe, Fengpu, Xinan, Yongping, Yong'an, Anning, Gongping, Xinming, and Taishun ships, which have carried more than 30,000 to 40,000 people. They are still continuing to handle this matter.</p>
<h3>The National Medicine Industry Association Raises Donations</h3>
<p>For the purpose of providing relief to the beleaguered members in Zhabei and extending comfort to the soldiers on the front lines, the Municipal National Medicine Industry Association has dispatched personnel to raise donations, stating: "Zhabei has suffered a tragic war, and the Japanese barbarians have committed arson, turning everything into scorched earth. Tens of thousands of our beleaguered colleagues have fled to the outside, exposed and starving, suffering immensely. This association has specially established a medicine shelter in the safe area of the concession to provide relief. Currently, a large number of beleaguered colleagues have registered with the association, requesting assistance. However, this association is unable to do what it wishes, and must appeal to all of you. Please, all members, in the spirit of helping each other in times of need, generously donate to enable us to provide as much shelter as possible and overcome difficulties together. Furthermore, this time, the 19th Route Army has been loyal and bravely killing the enemy, winning glory for the country, which has inspired all of us compatriots. However, the soldiers on the front lines are bleeding and fighting fiercely, facing extreme hardships. Our members belong to the nation, and we should raise funds to purchase supplies and send them to extend comfort, thereby encouraging the spirit and expressing patriotic enthusiasm. We especially hope that you will generously donate funds to be collected and sent to the Chamber of Commerce for forwarding to the front lines to be distributed to the soldiers. We have written down the causes and hope that you will all consider them."</p>

Rescuing people from danger; 2. Arranging shelter; 3. Providing nursing; 4. Managing food distribution. Those who need the above assistance can call or go to the association. The association is also working with more than 20 nurses from Tongji Hospital and the Red Cross Society, taking on the tasks of front-line rescue and rear treatment. It is also doing its best to supply medical equipment and relief supplies. We hope that all sectors will provide assistance and enthusiastically donate.</p>

<h3>Treacherous Merchants Supply the Enemy with Provisions</h3>
<p>▲Cheng Qin Guan Has Been Arrested for Questioning</p>
<p>Cheng Qin Guan, the owner of Cheng Da Xiang Rice Shop at No. 50 Wuchang Road, has, at this time of war between China and Japan, acted without conscience and has been supplying the Japanese army with rice and grain. A worker at the shop, motivated by patriotic indignation, reported the matter. The Volunteer Army National Salvation Association has dispatched personnel to arrest him and question him in detail. The treacherous merchant has admitted his guilt and stated that yesterday, several 石 of rice were secretly transported to the Huangpu Wharf for delivery. At this time of national crisis, it is deplorable that there are still unscrupulous merchants supplying the enemy with provisions. He should be punished most severely. Resolution of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>Within the International Settlement</p>
<h3>Statistics on Refugees</h3>
<p>▲57,539 People as of Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army troops provoked an unprovoked incident on the evening of the 28th of last month, leading to clashes with our army in Hongkou and Zhabei, the number of residents from those areas seeking refuge in the International Settlement has been quite large. Yesterday, the Municipal Council conducted a survey and compiled statistics on refugees within the Settlement. As of yesterday, there were as many as 57,539 refugees. The number of refugees continuing to flee here is still increasing. It is feared that the number will increase significantly in the coming days. The distribution of the refugee population as of yesterday is shown in the survey table below:</p>
<p>Area　Number　Accommodation</p>
<p>Jing'an Temple　　2,000　Living in various hostels and friends' homes in Jing'an Temple</p>

<h3>Yesterday's</h3>
<h3>Ships to Ningbo Turned Back from Songkou</h3>
<p>▲Ships Arrived in Ningbo the Previous Evening</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tu Nan, Gongping, Taishun, Sanbei Wanxiang, Ning Shao, and Xin Ning Shao and other six ships were scheduled to depart for Ningbo yesterday. Each ship was loaded with a large number of refugees, approximately 30,000 people, in the morning. The Taishun, Tu Nan, Wanxiang, and Xin Ning Shao set sail first, followed by the Gongping and other ships. However, upon reaching Songkou, they heard that Japanese warships had opened fire on our forts. Fearing danger, the merchant ships immediately turned back. The Jardine Matheson's Xin Beijing was also unable to sail. Passengers on each ship had to temporarily return their tickets.</p>
<p>According to news from the China Merchants Bureau yesterday, the Ning Shao liner Xin Jiangtian arrived in Ningbo at 11:45 PM the night before, and the Jiahe also arrived in Ningbo at 9:15 AM yesterday morning. This shows that the rumors circulating outside are inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Chinese Tramways Operated Normally Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Chinese tramways in Nanshi suspended operations from the afternoon of the 2nd (two days ago) due to the bank strike and the company's failure to pay wages to the workers. Subsequently, the company negotiated with those responsible for the union and explained the reasons why wages could not be paid as scheduled. However, in order to take care of the workers' daily lives, the company decided to do its best to find a way to pay each person five yuan to help them temporarily. In addition, the Municipal Public Security Bureau advised and instructed them to resume work promptly to avoid traffic disruptions, causing misunderstandings among citizens and affecting local security. The workers indicated their acceptance, so all tramways resumed normal operations yesterday. However, due to martial law, the tramcars had to start running from the factory at 9:00 AM and return to the factory at 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Letter to the Jardine Matheson Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>▲Requesting Notification to All Foreign Firms to Stop Loading Orders</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in view of the fact that the Japanese troops have invaded Shanghai and committed atrocities, turning the commercial area into a battlefield, which will inevitably lead to a halt in the economic power of Chinese merchants, has sent a letter to the Jardine Matheson Chamber of Commerce, requesting notification to all foreign firms to stop loading orders. The original letter reads as follows: Dear Sirs, Since January 28, when the Japanese marines stationed in Shanghai provoked the Chinese defense forces, Shanghai has been in a state of war. Recently, Japan has sent additional troops to Shanghai, and the incident is likely to escalate. Those who are relocating from Shanghai are doing so in an endless stream. The businesses of Chinese merchants are on the brink of collapse. Due to the major changes in the situation mentioned above, which occurred suddenly, all businesses are unable to ship the goods ordered from foreign factories. After public consultation, we have asked your chamber to notify all foreign firms in Shanghai that are acting as intermediaries for ordering goods to immediately电外國廠家 to stop loading any goods that have not yet been shipped. We will fulfill the previous agreements as soon as this unfortunate incident subsides. We hope that your chamber will understand and appreciate this reasonable and unavoidable request. To the Jardine Matheson Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Ken Yeh Bank's Ningbo Branch Continues to Exchange Cash as Usual</h3>
<p>The Ningbo market always follows Shanghai's lead. Once the Shanghai financial market stagnates, the circulation of funds in Ningbo will be affected. Local banking circles, such as the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Siming Bank, convened a plenary meeting at the Chamber of Commerce to maintain the overall situation and mitigate the risk of financial problems. They decided to follow the example of their counterparts in Shanghai and temporarily suspend business. In addition to complying with the public consensus of the industry, the Ningbo branch of the Ken Yeh Bank continued to pay out deposits and transfers as usual in order to facilitate depositors and customers. Furthermore, as the bank's banknotes have always been trusted by the people of Ningbo, and in order to make it easier for banknote holders to exchange them for cash, the bank entrusted all local money shops, which had not suspended business, to redeem the banknotes. In addition, it sent telegrams to its exchange offices in Cixi, Zhenhai, Yuyao, Dinghai, and Shenjiamen, instructing them to continue to exchange banknotes for cash as usual. As a result, not only were there few requests to exchange the bank's banknotes in recent days, but some people were even exchanging現洋 for the bank's banknotes in order to take them inland. For a time, the market price of the bank's banknotes rose by 10 yuan per 100 yuan, which helped to stabilize public sentiment.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of the Commander of the 6th Gendarmerie Regiment</h3>
<p>In addition to the 19th Route Army, the 6th Gendarmerie Regiment was also a powerful force fighting on the front lines. The regiment consisted of three battalions, and it had been serving as the main force on the right wing of the offensive in the Zhabei Baoshan Road Baoxing Road North Railway Station area for the past several days. All of the soldiers in the regiment had experience in combat. The regiment's commander, Qi Xueqi, personally supervised the battle and encouraged his troops. The regiment's 士　soldiers had high morale and were eager to灭此朝食. Commander Qi Xueqi is a graduate of the U.S. Army War College. He has served as the battalion commander, chief instructor, and commander of the 1st Gendarmerie Regiment of the Commander-in-Chief's Office. The Commander-in-Chief's Office changed its organization this time and reassigned him to his current position. He is currently under the command of Commander Gu Zhenglun.</p>
<p>Volunteer Army Actively Moves Forward</p>
<p>▲Second Group of Citizens Departed: The vanguard detachment of the Citizens' Volunteer Army was led to the front by Wang, the general commander, along with Wang Zhixiang, the vanguard detachment leader. Another 200+ soldiers from the army departed to the front in Zhabei yesterday and stayed in various places, like Shangyu Tongxiang Association, on Yongxing Road.</p>
<p>▲Notice of the Brave and Fearless Vanguard Team: Cheng Shouda · Zhu Duan · Jiang Yulin · Wu Kunshan · Zhang Zhigang · Liu Fenggui · and others announced, "Dear Fellow Citizens, Yulin and others have been striving for revolution for over a decade. Since the 15th year (of the Republic), our government set its base in Nanjing and unified the nation. Yulin and others believe that the revolutionary cause　has been fulfilled, and that the constitutional governance can be achieved through political training. The Three Principles of the People, which were initiated by the late Premier Sun Yat-Sen, can be completely realized so that the country can be independent, equal, and free. The suffering of our people can be alleviated. Who could have expected that years of internal strife, with the rampant presence of bandits and communists, would result in such an unstable state? This unrest has aroused the covetousness of the violent Japanese. The former forcibly occupied the Northeast and is now encroaching on Beijing and Shanghai. Where gunboats arrive, homes turn to ashes; such inhumanity has reached its peak. With his own eyes, Yulin has witnessed this and his heart is broken. He aims to gather patriotic comrades in the near future to organize a courageous and fearless vanguard team. The goal is to inspire the self-defense spirit of the people and fulfill the responsibility of every citizen. Compatriots, let's all rise up! This Notice on the 3rd day of February, the 21st Year (of the Republic).</p>
<p>▲The Third Group of Postal Workers Departed: Two contingents of Postal Workers Volunteer Army have already left for the front lines. Another battalion, led by Battalion Commander Zhu Xuefan, was deployed to continue the rescue, fire protection, and transportation efforts on the battlefield. Regiment Commander Zhang Kechang has gone to the front lines to inspect and instruct, it is said.</p>

<p>Japanese Youth</p>
<h3>Disguised as a Street Urchin</h3>
<p>▲Carrying a Pair of Ragged Bamboo Baskets</p>
<p>▲Hiding Bombs, Attempting to Cause Trouble</p>
<p>▲Japanese Military Symbols Found on Person</p>
<p>▲Residents Must Pay Attention Everywhere</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 to 5:00 PM, a Japanese man, about 20 years old, disguised as a street urchin who rummages through garbage piles in various alleys, was noticed by a woman between Fujian Road and the Fourth Avenue. She immediately called out to passersby, and they apprehended the Japanese man. The Japanese man's clothes were extremely ragged, and he was carrying a pair of ragged bamboo baskets on his shoulders. It is said that the baskets contained bombs and that he was attempting to cause trouble in the Concession. Japanese military symbols were found on his person. After being arrested, he claimed to be from Guangdong. He was later taken to the Nanjing Road police station for handling. This shows that the Japanese are meticulous in their efforts to disrupt order in the Concession.</p>
<h3>Japanese Intruded into the Sassoon House</h3>
<p>▲Plotting to Sabotage the International Radio Station</p>
<p>▲Arrested by Detectives</p>
<p>Yesterday at noon, four or five Japanese浪人 suddenly broke into the International Radio Station at the Sassoon House on the Bund of Nanjing Road, attempting to sabotage it. Fortunately, internal staff discovered the intrusion and immediately reported it to the police. Many experienced detectives were dispatched immediately and arrested the four or five浪人. However, the incident caused great terror within the building. People ran in all directions along Nanjing Road, and order was greatly disrupted.</p>
<h3>A Person Resembling a Japanese Nearly Met with Disaster</h3>
<p>▲The Weng Brothers Are Both Short and Plump</p>
<p>▲Why Keep a Japanese　Ridge</p>
<p>The Weng brothers, who are in the business of洋货, are named Weng Shenglin and Weng Sheng, respectively. They are from Fuzhou, Fujian, and reside at No. 31 Tongchun Lane, Fair Road, Hongkou International Settlement. However, both men are short and plump, with dark yellow skin. They even keep Japanese-style short mustaches under their noses. Their appearance is very similar to that of Japanese pirates. As the Hongkou area is the base of Japanese military operations, they abandoned everything and moved with their families to Room 8, Dongxin Hotel, No. 47 Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street, French Concession the day before yesterday. Around 8:00 PM last night, the two brothers happened to be loitering near the entrance when they were spotted by residents, who mistook them for Japanese spies. A great uproar ensued, and a crowd of about 300 to 400 people gathered. The patrolling policemen, fearing that the incident would cause trouble, immediately reported it to the 大自鳴鐘 police station by telephone. The head of the police station, upon hearing the report, dispatched a large number of detectives to suppress the crowd and took the Weng brothers to the police station. After questioning them in detail, the head of the police station realized that it was a misunderstanding and released them immediately.</p>
