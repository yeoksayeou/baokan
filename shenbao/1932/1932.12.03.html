<p>國内扎蘭屯附近連日有激戰　蔣電鄂豫皖省府規定省府主席職權　蒙古王公及各盟旗代表到京　陳誠部二次收復滸灣</p>

<h3>國際聨盟處理中日爭案前途混沌組織調解委員會説漸次有力</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）十九特委會已將李頓報告書之討論移交國聨大會、故在星期二日以前、此間遂呈表面沉寂、内幕緊張之象、據一般幹練觀察家之意見、國聨有史以來最重要之一頁將從此開始矣、下星期之最數日、將爲極有關係之時期、不獨可表現國聨機關應付此次空前難題、具有何等能力、且亦可决定所可望於美國之合作程度、雖會塲討論將涉及李頓報告書之全部範圍、但最爲人注意者、則爲大會中之動議、及將爲十九委員會所處理之决議案耳、就美國所可贊助者而言、各點中之最扼要者、爲國聨對於「滿洲國」之態度、一般意見、似信必有不承認「滿洲國」之决定、</p>
<p>尙有一重要問題、爲根據國聨盟約第十五條、提出最後報告期限之决定、此點已由顏惠慶博士提出、將爲十九委員會於大會辯論後首須决定之一事、</p>
<p>茲闻星期二日會議時、日本將續發聲明書、解釋其態度、衆信此次聲明書、將較前次聲明書更進一步、不獨論述過去事件、且將涉及日本對於將來之希望、不過日本在述其將來希望時、未必有所建議也、</p>
<p>戰債問題與美國軍縮新態度所造成之紛擾、可於今日殊乏精彩之會議中見之、會塲中唯一事件、爲顏惠慶博士解决變相的戰爭時期之申請、十九委員會亦如已於星期一日休會之行政院、將此難題移交星期二日大會解决</p>
<p>歐美各國政府、似在各方面豕突、自顧不暇、所可確定者、各小國將發言反對日本耳、現有包括四點之提案、爲㈠通過李頓報告書中關於歴史的部分、㈡規定解决期限、㈢重新肯定不承認「滿洲國」之諾言、㈣成立調解委員會、加入美俄代表、惟以今日形勢觀之、大國對此提案、能否贊同、尙有疑問也（路透一日電）</p>
<p>（南京）顧維鈞前隨調查團在東北時、所撰關於中國事件之説帖十九種、現國聨會各國代表多欲　閲、以期明暸遠東情况、刻由外部定印一百册、寄往日内瓦、交我國代表分贈並將此項説帖、分贈在京之駐華各國公使代辦、以供參考、（二日專電）</p>
<h3>特别大會議程</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聨臨時大會、將於六日上午十一時開會、其順序先由議長宣告開會、中代表顏惠慶氏演説、繼由日代表松岡演説、中國政府之意見書或在此時提出、中日代表演説後、兩代表不討論、即由各國代表發表意見、但發言國未决定、各國代表之演説、最少繼續兩三日、最後中日代表對於各國代表之演説、加以説明或反駁、中日問題或將再移交十九國委員會、由委員會報告臨時大會、然後組織包含中日代表之調停委員會、引用第十五條第三項規章、研究解决方法、（日聨二日電）</p>
<p>（東京）據日方所傳、松岡洋右在行政會之演説、多注重過去事實、强辯進兵佔領東三省爲自衛行爲、但各國之印象依然不能放鬆日本有併呑滿蒙野心、所謂僞組織不過暫時掩蓋世界耳目、日代表爲鑑及此點、在六日之大會席上、或將變更從前之策略、對於未來日本之所應取步驟、加以逐一申述、求恕各小國、勿再猜疑東三省爲韓國第二、然而演説内容、是否能完全掩盡東三省目前之現有實情、此點日人自身亦無把握云、（華聨社二日東京電）</p>
<p>調解委員會覓取妥協方案</p>
<h3>大會通過後開始工作</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）十九委員會、認爲在國聨非常大會表示意見之前、該委員會之動作、實屬無益、故除主席希孟氏召集大會外、該委員會暫不開會、惟準備　擬一種報告書、其中結論、第一在不承認滿洲國、第二在邀請蘇俄及美國參加、組織一種人數較少之委員會、爲中日兩國尋覓調解及妥協方案、此項調解委員會、一俟十九委員會所擬報告書爲大會採納之後、即開始工作、主席希孟氏、與日本代表松岡會晤之後、已回比京、此事在星期二以前、不致有何變化、（哈瓦斯一日電）</p>
<h3>日電所傳三種解决方案</h3>
<p>中日間直接交涉歟</p>
<p>國際調停委員會歟</p>
<p>國聨再派調查團歟</p>
<p>（東京）據由日内瓦到逹外務省之情報、國聨方面、漸知中日問題、不能急速解决、尤以大國方面、傾向靜觀、知遷延解决之外、别無他法、從六日起開會之總會、先使小國方面、發揮議論後、將報告書之審議、委托於十九國委員會、結果該委員會或能達到何等的解决案、但在此靜觀期中、考慮下列三案、爲中間的處置　　㈠直接交涉勸告案、由國聨勸告中日兩國、開始直接交涉、以謀問題之解决、國聨任命中立委員、以監視人資格出席、從旁居中調停</p>
<p>㈡調停委員會案、爲和緩中日兩國之主張起見、以作製調停案爲目的、以十九國委員會爲主體、加入美俄、設置調停委員會靜觀滿洲事態、約二個月後、再講究解决案、</p>
<p>㈢現地再調查委員會案、爲視察李頓報告書執筆後之滿洲獨立、及日本承認情况等起見、網羅主要理事國之外交官、設置調查委員會、國聨根據此報告、再行審議、日本外務當局、對此三案之非正式意見、大體如下、㈠國聨苟能進至承認滿洲、雖暫時靜觀不急於解决、亦爲實明之策、故日本政府苟不觸及其旣定方針、對此並不反對㈡鑑於絶對反對第三國之加入、爲日本之旣定方針、國聨所提倡之直接交涉、恐難實現㈢除外中日兩國之調停委員會案、從拒絶第三國加入之原則、絶對反對、㈣如第三案之委員會案、係調查報告書提出后之新狀態、雖不反對、但其設置須始終尊重日本之原則、（電通二日電）</p>
<h3>日本與國際委員會外務省之贊否態度</h3>
<p>（東京）據外務省所接情報、國聨事務局及大國方面、設立國際委員會之説現較有力、而外務省待中日紛爭付交該委員會、視其經過後採取對策、似較爲賢明之策也、但委員會之企圖與其搆成、由下列之理由、殊堪重視、㈠該委員會若無中日代表、則將如調停委員會、而中日兩國立於被告地位、故反對、㈠即使中日均加入該會、但依排除第三國加入之旣定方針亦所反對㈠然該委員會之搆成與機能、爲調查「滿洲國」之事情、僅報告國聨、而有相當期間靜觀之性質、則不加反對、（電通二日電）</p>
<h3>東京女學生提倡武裝</h3>
<p>受嚴格軍事訓練</p>
<p>華聨社二日東京電　東京高等女學校長會議中、議决將東京巿官辦民辦女學生三萬五千人武裝起來、由軍部派退伍軍官加以嚴格之軍事訓練、聞陸軍省甚贊同此舉、已允撥步槍三萬五千枚、及手槍·毒瓦斯防具·與各種衛生材料、從明春起開始訓練、日本婦女已被迫抛棄針線生活、而從事於爲　武主義者之所日夜夢想之侵略戰爭云、</p>
<p>[P凡勒拉發表重要談話</p>
<p>遠東問題能否解决之關鍵</p>
<p>在各國有無維持條約决心</p>
<p>杜白林　國聨行政院主席凡勒拉歸自日内瓦、今日語人云、國聨大會此次特别會議、未必能解决滿洲問題、仍將移交十九國委員會、届時十九國委員會、再行詳細研究李頓報告、準備一新决議案、然後再提交下次國聨大會、此種手續、固頗費時間、但渠信在此期間、中日雙方利益、俱可保全、</p>
<p>凡勒拉又謂、國聨各會員國猶未表明其立塲、但各國苟决定堅决維持國聨盟約與其他和平及不侵犯條約、則此事當可解决、</p>
<p>凡勒拉又於接見新聞記者時表示、現當計劃一種方法、探知滿洲人民之眞正　願所在、渠不主張召集公民大會、但以爲應由滿洲人民自行决定其與中國之關係、又謂渠信國聨之前途、完全繋於其對於此案之行動、及是否準備堅决維持其原則以爲斷、（國民一日電）</p>
<h3>丁逆士源企圖出席會議</h3>
<p>國聨秘書長不承認</p>
<p>日本代表表示遺憾</p>
<p>（日内瓦）「滿洲國」來日内瓦之代表丁士源與勃浪生、曾由「滿洲國」（僞外長）通告國聨秘書長德魯蒙派丁士源爲溥儀代表、勃浪生爲「滿洲國政府」代表、德魯蒙因「滿洲國」係非加盟國、僅發表有該通告、而未公布通告内容、故日本代表以爲遺憾、曾斡旋欲將該内容非正式傳逹關係國、使國聨及各國代表、隨時以該二代表作爲「滿洲國」代表云（電通一日電）</p>
<h3>日政黨軍閥籌開國民大會</h3>
<p>反對李頓報告書</p>
<p>要求承認僞組織</p>
<p>大阪　日因感覺國聨空氣日趨對日不利、前途愈益暗淡、爲重新振起民氣與藉國民之團結威迫國聨、於是遂有政友會·民政黨·國民同盟·大日本生產黨·大阪及京都在鄉軍人團、海軍兵團等聨合提倡開國民大會、定十二月四日下午在京都岡崎公會堂開會、議决反對李頓報告書、反對否認日人手創之僞組織、大動旗鼓、以日本國民大會名羲拍電向國聨大會示威、（二日華聨社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>甚囂塵上之歐洲戰債問題</h3>
<p>數載以前。喧嘩歐陸震動英美者。爲賠償問題。而比歲以還。則國際視綫。已移易而集於戰債問题。所謂戰債問題者。蓋當前番世界大戰之際。協約國軍實之所需。恃美國爲外府。復以現金缺乏。軍實之供應。乃轉變而爲借欵。即所謂戰債是也。自凡爾塞和約告成以後。戰敗之德國。年須繳納二十萬萬金馬克以上之賠欵。人民汗血之所入。供諸政府。政府轉以付諸協約國。歐洲協約國。更須以賠欵收入之大部分。提供於美國。以爲支付戰債本息之用。美國之所以能成爲世界上最大債權國。紐約之所以能取倫敦而代之。成爲世界金融之中心。美國國際金融資本主義之勢力之所以能瀰漫於全球。胥受世界大戰之賜也。</p>
<p>世間任何精當確實之理論金科玉律之規條要均須有實質的經濟條件爲其護符。一旦時異境遷。則言者固振振有辭。終必無以克制已非之事實。往昔齗齗於賠欵之爭。而今日僅及於單純的戰債問題者。良以此耳經十餘年賠欵之搜括。德國財政。已入於竭澤而漁之候。而經十餘年之生息。德國國力則已漸不可侮。德人於此。乃從容不迫。以無力支付賠欵告諸世界。歐洲協約國。將欲以威力臨諸德國乎。則將促德國之早趨極端。一火燎原。必迅致全歐於赤化。而所謂歐洲協約國者。其内部之猜疑衝突。復日趨銳化英意兩國旣欲扶植德國以抗法。則所謂威力云者。恐亦徒使法人爲衆矢之的而已。</p>
<p>賠欵之續付。旣爲事實所不許。則自惟有移轉目光於戰債。美總統胡佛氏於此。乃出其制勝於機先之策略。在歐洲列國要求緩付戰債通諜未發之前。慨然於去冬自動宣布緩付戰債一年。當其時也。舉世交譽。蘇俄震驚。認爲帝國主義衝突中出人意料之舉。而胡佛氏之初望。亦欲藉此使世界恐慌。迅現昭蘇重復繁榮。則資本主義之壽命。即可永延不墜支付戰債。自更不成問題。乃曾幾何時。而一年之瓜期已届。世界之恐慌則方興未艾戰債問題。遂復甚囂塵上。此則爲胡佛氏初料所不及者。</p>
<p>以言戰債問題。則歐美間爭持最烈者。其一爲戰債賠欵之連環關係。歐洲協約國。認支付戰債應以收到賠欵爲條件。故德國如無力續繳賠欵。協約國亦將停付戰債。美國則始終認賠欵爲一事。而戰債爲又一事。不容其間發生公然的連環關係。最近則英國復以收到法國對彼之戰債。爲支付英對美全部戰債之條件。此則因大戰之際。美國認英國有較堅强之國際信用。對協約國借欵。多以英國爲對手。更由英國轉借於其他協約國。借欵之際。事實上旣已有連環關係。償付之際。英國遂復提出連環關係以對抗。此則戰債與賠欵連環關係之外。復有戰債與戰債之連環關係。情形之複雜如此。乃使旁觀者如墮五里霧中矣。</p>
<p>歐美間爭持之第二點。則爲個别解决及整個解决問題。洛桑會議者。歐洲列强聨合一致。以對付美國戰債問題者也。美國旣不願歐洲列國之樹立聨合戰綫。復以此種聨合戰線。於交涉時多所不利。乃遂一再聲明。願與任何歐洲協約國單獨談判戰債問題。但不願與任何國際集團談判。此外復遣派政治上及金融上重要人物。游説歐洲各國。以圖破其聨合戰綫。觀其雙方鈎心鬭角之狀况。當亦可見列强間衝突之情形。固永難望其消釋也。</p>
<p>然歐洲列强間之戰線。果能維持於不破乎。就英國立塲而言。則三千萬鎊之鉅數。支出誠覺可惜然終不欲以不可一世之英帝國。遽爲無力償債之人。因不得不以對法債權之連環關係。爲其不能全部償付之理由。而法人則以此爲英人諉過於法嫁禍於法之手段。而英法間之齟　已啓聨合戰綫破裂之端倪。</p>
<p>吾人就現况觀察。則今番届期之戰債。英法或將終於照付。而附以戰債必須重行整理之條件。在明年舉行之國際經濟會議中。美國或將以裁軍爲條件而允許戰債之减付。惟自一九三零年海牙賠償會議之後。至一九三一年而復有停止戰債之舉。世界情形之惡化。旣日甚一日則戰債問題。即能暫告段落。亦不過暫支殘局之一種表現耳。</p>

<h3>傀儡國的預算哈爾濱通信</h3>
<p>所謂「滿洲國」、誰都知道那是個傀儡劇塲、恐怕事實上連傀儡也不如、純粹是日本軍國主義者的御用工具、别無作用、傀儡國從今年三月間成立到現在、表面上日本人方面自以爲這是玩得最好的一套把戲、確能博得他國内人民的讚頌、因爲這是替日本國開疆拓土、可是在另一方面、日本軍部的意思、以爲侵奪了東北、一則可以掩蔽日本當前的經濟恐慌、麻醉著一般日本人、再則可以就此擴張軍部實力、壓倒所謂立憲政黨的民主主義潮流、三則可以借此穏定軍部的實力、維持軍國的殘喘、</p>
<p>傀儡國的架子算擺起來了、什麽總長次長等等、都已裝扮齊整、在日本軍官和浪人指揮之下登塲、而各種制度·法規·以及五顏六色的機關、也都設立起來了、可是所謂「民族自覺」自發的運動者、僅只是一個空殼、實際的權力、從前在所謂總務廳長駒井德三手裏、現在又有了新的變動、從前慫動在東北變亂的浪人如駒井德三·大川明固·這一批人、再不能在滿洲住下去、軍部固然要驅遂他們、即日本官吏也是跟隨軍部之後、所以這羣功狗、也只得離開、讓軍部全權統治、</p>
<p>在日本軍部指揮之下的「滿洲國」、據他們在海外的宣傅、和日本國内新聞紙的記載、説什麽東亞和平、說什麽人民的安全、都是些騙人的謊語、只有加强日本的國防、是近眞的話、就是「生命線」的說話、也是騙日本一般人的鬼話、現在的東北三省、中國人固然嘗盡了辛酸、受盡了氣、不敢說半句關於時局的話、對日本軍隊·日本官·日本人、只有柔順、或可免被飛災、而日本的商民、從前本可以安居樂業、現在却是遍處荆棘、十萬大兵也保護不了最低限的安寗秩序、</p>

<h3>甘肅財政困難情况</h3>
<p>軍費佔全部支出百分之七十餘</p>
<p>蘭州通信、甘肅地處邊陲、交通梗塞、故財政困窘、在昔係受他省協餉、嗣協餉停止、始自謀維持、平日無事、省庫之收入、尙可敷衍現狀、一遇變故發生、即入不敷出、自民九大地震後、天災人禍、接踵而來、以致省庫收入、益爲銳减、爰分述現在甘省之財政狀况及其困難之原因如左、</p>
<p>溯甘省以民九大地震爲造成財政困難之遠因、馴至民十七八之災歉、及回漢衝突、更爲其困難之大原因、近數年來、每隔數用、必有一次兵災、或他種大變、故造成從來未有之貧困、質言之、現在甘肅困苦之遠因、當歸於天災、近因當歸於人禍、天災姑勿論、究其人禍、乃完全爲軍隊以致之、蓋甘省軍隊之複雜、遠非他省所可比現在統計、有六個師·二個獨立旅·三路游擊司令·一路警衛司令·及所謂幹部學校補習大隊等等、最少當有九萬五千人、以甘肅全省人口六百二十萬計算、平均每六十五人須養一兵、估計每一兵之餉項給養服裝軍械諸費、每年最少需洋一百五十元、是人民之負擔、已平均每人每年二元三角矣、再加馬匹一、項除甘肅騎兵第一師全部騎兵外、其他部隊之馬匹、若以人數十分之三計算、（甘省軍隊中之騎兵、較中原各省之軍隊爲多、）則當共有馬三萬三千餘匹、每馬每日需給養洋四角、則一日需洋一萬三千二百元、一年需洋四百八十一萬八千元、每人又須負擔八角、故只軍費一項、共計每人須負擔三元一角、每年全省應支軍費、已超過一千八百萬元以上、雖經主其事者一再縮減、然各部隊除向省府支取八百六十五萬餘元外、所差之數、將近千萬、完全直接取於農民、不容缺欠毫釐、是農民實際所出之糧賦僅二百二十萬元、而直接供給軍隊之費用、則四倍半於糧賦、良以甘省軍隊、不惟數目太多、又純爲無系統無紀律及不集中的軍隊、某軍駐紮某處、其駐軍即完全視其防地爲自已勢力範圍、派欵提欵、從心所欲、稍不如意、則蹂躪逼勒、無所不用其極、人民賣妻鬻子、以塡其慾壑、如今年全省六十六縣中、被旱·雹·蟲·霜·以及各種天災者五十餘縣、米榖食糧、產量原不足用、以理度之、糧價當然抬高、乃事寳適得其反、隴南隴東一帶各縣、糧雖歉收、其糧價不惟不高、反日趨於下、雖賤價猶不得買主、究其原因、一由於土匪横行、人民疲於奔命、雖有少些食糧、儲之不可、携之不能故不得不廉價出售、一由於軍隊逼迫勒索、人民畏其淫威、雖食糧不足應用、猶不能不忍痛出售、以濟燃眉之急、故糧價極低、仍無銷路、然此兩種原因、後者尤甚於前、蓋匪患不過一時的現象、而駐軍則爲永久的禍患、致人民求生不得、求死不可、終年如在荆棘叢中也、　　　甘肅以軍隊複雜之故、省庫之稅源、無一不受其破壞、糧賦一項、軍隊固先期在各縣截取、直接提徵烟畝罰欵、近亦成爲當然之事、甚至預徵二十二年及二十三年三分之一、其他如菸酒印花各機關、無不視爲已有、同時各軍又包庇烟土、包運貨物、尤大足破壞全省財政而有餘、是以近來省庫愈空、人民愈困、而軍隊之名譽亦完全掃地、</p>
<p>甘肅財政之收入、合國家稅地方稅而言之、年額計爲一千三百一十三萬八千八百零七元、實際收入則僅八百八十萬二千二百四十八元、支出方面、每年共一千一百一十八萬零三百七十元、軍費一項、年逹八百六十五萬二千三百二十四元、是軍費一項、即佔全部支出之百分之七七·四、亦即軍費一項、當其他一切支出之三倍半、若以實際收入與軍費比較、是全部之實際收入、僅當軍費一項之支出而已、</p>
<p>至於其他各項支出、政費年八十九萬二千七百二十四元、當全支百分之八而不足、黨費年十萬零八千元、司法費年十一萬零一百一十二元、均當全支百分之一而不足、敎育費年五十八萬四千三百五十元、當全支百分之五·二、各縣行政費年四十九萬三千五百元、當全支百分之四·四、財務行政費年二十四萬元、當全支百分之二而少强、其他一切之支出、僅九萬九千餘元、當全支百分之一而不足甘省軍隊爲數固多、而土匪依然不少、邇來據各縣報告、全省仍有土匪六千餘人、（此係彙集各縣政府報告數目、其實數當不止五倍於此）散居各處、其大股土匪、固不待論、如靖遠·涇川·渭源等縣、均各有駐軍一營以上、然七八匪徒、竟可手持馬刀横行無阻、絶不因有駐軍而稍畏懾此可見兵自兵而匪自匪矣、</p>

<p>東北商人歇業南下</p>
<h3>認國貨：：：作外貨逼國人：：：易滿籍</h3>
<p>日人武力經濟侵略之結果</p>
<p>國人速起！迅謀何以復業</p>
<p>日人自佔我東北以來、用其亡韓故智、漸次奪我金融、佔我巿塲、更進而虐我國民、近頃以來、在東北經商之國人、以不勝其苛捐重税、紛紛棄業南下、記者遇由奉天來滬之旅客、詳述東北國人之惨痛、及由南方去者被日人惨虐之狀况、爰爲記述如下、</p>
<p>國貨絶跡　自九月二十五日、僞國强佔東北各關、對於我國貨物、由滬津等各埠運往者、認爲外國貨、開徵開稅、大連本爲自由港、進口貨向不收稅、故洋貨運連、多由上海轉口、江海關課稅一重、今日人已運動歐美各國、赴大連貨咸不經上海、直接裝去、可免進口稅、因之大連洋貨充斥於巿、價格尤廉、中國貨被洋貨驅逐殆盡、東三省各處、非洋貨即日貨、中國貨幾致絶蹟、</p>
<p>華商停業　在遼寗·營口·安東·大連·以及長春·各地、國人商業甚巨、經營綢緞土布及南北貨者、到處皆有商號、自九月二十五日後、國產絲織品棉織品以及南北土貨、遽爾絶蹟、不能運到、其主因在東北客帮、不能採辦、國產品至東北、再加苛稅雜捐、致國貨價值、漲起數倍、而綢緞竟至不得進口、於本月分起、在東北商人、紛紛停業南回、巿上絲棉織品、悉被日貨奪去、邇日從奉天營口大連等處南下商人、已有四百多名、連日奉天丸大連丸等到滬、大半爲此輩南方商人、據稱、不日尙有千名、繼續回南、</p>
<p>日人兇横　東北遍地義勇軍、日人勢力、僅沿鐵路一隅、在東北日人最畏義軍之襲攻、故近來對於國人從南方或天津等處、乘輪到大連營口安東者、在入境時、其搜檢之嚴、盤查之密、爲向所未有、稍有支吾、或答復略緩、立即捕去、從此即無生回、蓋日人視赴東北之國人、幾個個認爲義勇軍也、苟無當地商店及住户切實作保、實不易入境、大連碼頭、每次上海去輪、總有多名國人捕去、故深望國人、如無切要事項或無熟識商店、最好暫時不往、蓋恐徒送生命也、</p>
<p>强易國籍　東北居民、已由日人强迫、不准再用中國二字、一切字據、或對外、須令書滿洲國字樣、違則罰辦、此次奉天有商人陳金榮·林逸仕·林希九·逢仰空·等數十人南下來滬、其在購買船票時、日人强令書滿洲國、不准再冩中國、以「滿洲國」名義來滬之國人、此尙爲第一次、</p>

<h3>伍朝樞昨返滬</h3>
<p>談華北地大物博惜缺乏人事</p>
<p>中日問題解决在自身有力量</p>
<p>三全會將出席現正即擬提案</p>
<p>中委伍朝樞氏、偕其夫人、前赴平津及西北游歷、已一月有餘、業於昨晨由京乘</p>
<p>夜車抵滬　當即返寓休息、中央社記者、昨晨往訪伍氏於其寓邸、當承延見、談話如次、余此次北上、純係游歷、並無其他任務、蓋平津雖爲余舊游之地、然闊别已有十六年矣、而西北則從未去過、故此次北上游歷、藉以</p>
<p>考察華北之近狀、此游爲時一月有餘、經平·津·大同·綏遠·包頭·定縣·洛陽·西安·開封·徐州·等處、北方地大物博、惜缺乏人才、以致財寳棄於地下、農村經濟破產、如陜西原係肥腴之區、然因缺乏水利設備、以致連年災荒、余此次前往游歷、所見者爲赤地千里、人烟絶跡、如入蒙古沙漠之區、實堪浩歎、北方人民勤勞樸實、惟智識則不及南方人民、北方之反日空氣、亦殊消沈、不若南方之緊張、國聨將召開大會、討論</p>
<p>中日問題　然國聯將來究竟如何解决中日問題、我人目前實不能預加推測、蓋國聨並非一太上政府、國聨自身並無解决中日問題之力量、國聨所恃以爲力量者會員團及列强耳、目前對於中日問題、英國之態度如何、法國之態度如何、美俄之態度又如何、均甚迷糊不可推測、是以國聨對中日問題將如何解决、實難預料、至國聨之邀請美俄兩國参加發表意見、亦國聨藉以增加其自身之力量耳、我國如内政修明、外交自當有辦法、</p>
<p>三中全會已定於十五日在京召開、本人將前往出席、現正擬草一提案、内容注重於修明内政、蓋余已言之、内政修明、外交當有辦法、粤方中委是否出席三中全會、及有無提案、余無所聞、馮煥章先生雖在張家口時曾與晤面、然將否出席三中全會及有無提案、余亦不知、至馮氏對於内政外交之意見、仍與歷次報載馮氏之談話與通電相同、</p>

<p>日警越界捕人案餘波</p>
<h3>金永鐸雖已放回日領仍要求拘解納稅會函請保障</h3>
<p>日本領事署便衣警察於三十晚在法租界藍維靄路如意里二號、赿權逮韓人金永鐸·金哲·經法捕房將日警二名扣留、引起交涉一案、雖已於前晚交換放回、但法當局以日便衣警越界捕人、已非一次、故仍在搜集證物、以便交涉、</p>
<h3>前晚交換釋回</h3>
<p>領署便衣警越界捕走金澈後、尙餘兩警、相内山崎、正在續捕金哲、經捕房扣押、翌日、法領署即向日方嚴重交涉、日方於前晚六時、將金澈釋送法捕房、捕房待金到後、至七時、始將日警兩名釋放、</p>
<h3>金澈被毆受傷</h3>
<p>金氏被捕至日領署警務處後、頭面手指均被毆傷、國聞社記者昨晤金妻、據談、吾夫返來、手指已被拷軋受傷、兩手俱腫、頭面數處青紫、亦撃傷甚重、現在某處診治、至内部傷勢如何、因醫生尙未將檢騐傷單開出、故未知悉云云、</p>
<h3>歸化證書寄法</h3>
<p>國聞社記者又至金氏於民國十八年辦理歸化華籍之律師蔡曉白處訊問、據談、金氏確爲韓人入華籍、現已經釋放、當無大問題、不過法當局調閲昔年金氏歸化文件、因尙須加以考查、故由法領寄往法使署轉呈法國外交部披閱、然後再行寄回、今金確已爲華籍、中國政府、自應加以保護也云云、</p>
<h3>法領事署消息</h3>
<p>新聲社云、法領方面對此事仍不願有何正式發表、但以私人資格表示、領署方面、因日領已表示歉意、故認此事不必再有何要求、記者曾以如日再派人逮捕金等、法方將如之何、該氏答、如日方捕人、則法方即可依法逮捕之、然後詢以是否韓人、如彼認係韓人、當引渡日領署究辦、否則當待法公使之訓令如何而定云、</p>
<h3>巿府口頭抗議</h3>
<p>巿政府自該案發生、以金澈旣係華籍、前日即向法日兩當局先行口頭提出抗議、惟現人已放回、事成過去、是否再須續向對方抗議、保障以後、刻正在考慮研究中、</p>
<h3>納稅會之要函</h3>
<p>法租界納稅華人會致法總領事及警務處函云、逕啓者、據報、日本駐滬領事署、派遣密探、不依法律手續及國際公約、私擅逮捕法租界居民、經貴當局依法抗爭、日領署道歉、殊爲欽敬、全體居民、同聲頌揚、查日本官憲、恃其武力之優越、目無國際公約、目無法律、並目無各國、幾致人皆側目而視、不敢與較、經此貴當局於忍無可忍之下、予以相當之敎訓、或可使之稍爲歛跡、法租界居民、亦可稍爲安心、然尙未取得以後不再有同樣事件發生之保證、以其態度易變、猶未足使法租界居民有切實之保障、所以敝會除申敬意外、相應函請貴當局、取得日本領事署嗣後不再發生同樣事件之保證、以安居民、實爲公感、此致駐滬法總領事梅禮靄鈞鑒、法租界納稅華人會啓、</p>
<h3>日領仍將逮捕</h3>
<p>大美晚報云、茲聞日領事署對金澈與其姪金哲、仍擬下逮捕狀、送至法領事署、請加逮捕、解交日當局雖日期未經宣露、但其事必不在遠、</p>
<h3>須磨蔑視主權</h3>
<p>日領事署之情報員須磨與上海泰晤士報訪員談話、承認日警之强拘金澈、實屬重大之錯誤、但謂若輩並非有意侵犯法租界當局之權利、而其過實在誤認法租界爲華界所致、蓋中日當局曩曾商妥、日當局對於任何犯罪日人住居華界者、得取對付行動云云、譯者按須磨文過之言、殊屬可笑、又其所稱住居華界之任何犯罪日人、日當局可隨意逮捕、其心當目中有中國主權在耶、</p>
<h3>韓人商店危險</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨據法租界韓僑消息、近來日本便衣偵探、在韓僑間非常活動、韓人所開商店、幾乎每日有偵探假詢問物價爲由入内窺探、若輩皆操純粹韓語、更有數店、幾乎常爲日人暗中監視、此輩顯然皆偵探一流、因此韓人主顧、多畏慮裹足不前、至日探如此活動之眞原因究竟安在、尙無所聞、據外間、揣測、殆因日軍强佔滿洲受義軍猛烈抵抗後、恐韓人獨立運動、亦乘機加緊進行之故、目下朝鮮消息、因日人嚴厲檢查、絶少傳出國外、但據幸得洩出之二三簡訊、邇來正有許多韓人、在朝鮮境内或境　外、恊助東北義勇軍云、</p>
<h3>黃展榮已避匿</h3>
<p>粤人黃展榮、約晤金氏、似有預謀逮捕金氏父子嫌疑、雖無重大犯罪、但法捕房爲明暸此中情形、與此案發生預謀嫌疑起見、仍在查緝黃氏、以便證明、但黃現已避匿、且傳聞黃現受虹口某日人卵翼、家居不出云、</p>

<h3>劉廷芳先生信廿一·十二·二。</h3>
<p>邇以事來滬，恰遇貴報趁着六十週年的大慶以自强不息的精神，重新厘定工作方針，加緊努力，這眞是一椿足以令人爲之浮一大白的快事。眼巴巴地望到了十二月一日，一淸早便買來一份貴報，展開一看，編排也淸楚些了，自由談也革新了，還有流通圖書館業餘週刋讀者顧問等出世，一大串的好消息，都展現在眼前，新的生機，新的活力活躍在每一張紙上，我不禁破口呼出：（申報不老）！</p>
<p>爲其愛之深，所以責之也深，這裏，我對於讀者顧問還有一點意見，願一陳述。</p>
<p>據讀者顧問緣起裏面説：······本報當選聘若干專家爲提出者求問題之解答，而在簡則裏又註明問題的範圍限於政治經濟等八項，我所願提出意見來供貴報參考的便正是這兩點。</p>
<p>第一，我覺得問題的提出，不必加以限制。因爲宇宙是這樣的大，而羅列在我們眼前的都是問題。那一個問題該討論而那一個問題便不該討論，貴報旣願爲讀者的顧問，似不應爲讀者加上這樣一個限制。我認爲什麽問題都有討論的價値，從天談到地，從先古的爬蟲談到塵芥，都没有什麽不可以·何必在這一塊活活潑潑的園地硬打下一個討厭的籬笆？</p>
<p>第二，緣起中又有説；（一切問題與疑難都不是個人的，）這句話是絶對的對。正因爲問題不是個人的，所以我主張解答問題也不必由你們幾位（專家）負專責，最好是由讀者大家自由提出意見來活潑潑地討論，（當然這是指一部分重大的問題而言）再由貴（顧問）綜集意見，做一個結論。這樣一則可以（集思廣益），再則可以使讀者顧問不至流爲算術難題三百解答之類，何况這難題更不限定眞能完滿的解答呢？</p>
<p>鄙意如此，先生們以爲如何？</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>記者按：劉先生現任北大燕大敎授，爲我國内有數之學者。這次對本欄提出的兩點意見，我們認爲是極有價値，當充分接納并表示謝意。以後，讀者如願提出問題，可以隨便一點，但我們的簡則却也不必因而發生文字上的修改問題。至於第二點，我們當完全採納劉先生的意見，除了一些瑣碎的問題以外，其他比較重要的，我們當不先作答，只將原函刋出提交大衆討論，討論到個段落，再由我們綜合意見，做一個結論。</p>
<p>這裏，有一個問題，就請大衆開始討論罷：</p>

<h3>張雲秋女士信廿一·十二·一。</h3>
<p>這裏有一個似乎不重要而實在是很重要的問題，也許諸位先生們也早巳感覺到。</p>
<p>一對夫妻由戀愛以至結婚、這個階段，通常都是十二分的甜蜜，十二分的滿意，大有（願作鴛鴦不羨仙）或（願生同衾死同槨）之槪。但一到蜜月度過了，新夫婦的感情便巳由一濃得化不開）降而爲（化得開），再過了一月或兩月，再過了一年或兩年，便漸漸地感覺得兩者之間只有義務，没有感情，於是始而厲諸色，繼而出諸言，終而勃谿之聲時起，男的唉聲嘆氣，女的也愁眉苦臉，再進一步，不幸的事情便因而演出。如像　樣的悲劇，觸目都是，我也不幸就是主演這悲劇的一個。</p>
<p>先生，我要問你：㈠爲什麽這無數的夫妻竟會由愛情的沸點降落到零度？㈡這樣的悲劇有什麽方法可以補救？敬愛的先生，望你爲我解答這個難題，</p>

<h3>大批現洋出口洋釐又見上騰</h3>
<p>昨日銀行方面買氣又盛、市塲中人心遂復上昻、厘價因之騰貴、蓋以目前客銷轉暢、本街存底雖豐、經不起大宗之搜羅、故市氣終於高抬也、銀根大勢依然鬆穏如常、銀拆市面、外表雖穏、内容緊張如故、此種緊張、完全以不能流通、有以致之耳</p>

<h3>新婚之夜（二）</h3>
<p>— 冰瑩</p>
<p>這樣的話，她不知説過多少次，起初是有點傷感，而且有時下涙，但後來竟連愁容都没有了。她已經滿了三十六，但黄瘦的面孔，一看就以爲她至少是四十五六的準老太婆。她没有家庭，只是孤零零地替人家做着短工，補補衣服，梳梳頭過着日子。没有欠債，也從來没過過舒服的日了。因爲她是個不幸的人，所以無論誰家辦喜事，總禁止她去看，而她也很有自知之明，不到第二天是絶對不去看新娘子的。</p>
<p>（蓮姑娘，恭喜你討了個好嫂嫂，聽説很美麗，像個仙女下凡呢。）</p>
<p>訓嫂連忙向蓮大姐作揖道賀，而蓮大姐却很失望的回答她：</p>
<p>（美是很美，只是太年輕了，什麽事都不懂，昨晚還鬧了笑話，你聽到了嗎？）</p>
<p>（聽到了。不過不要緊，昨夜是初夜，照例新嫁娘是要客氣的，今晚就好了，兩個人只要熟了就没有問題。）</p>
<p>訓嫂説話好象像很有經騐的樣子。</p>
<p>（是呀！你還替他們擔心，説不定他們這時····）</p>
<p>儒老太太道兩句話的力量眞大，不但笑痛了她俩的肚子，而且連隔壁和隔壁的隔壁客人通通都被笑聲驚醒起來了！　　（二）</p>
<p>新娘秀姑娘正像一般人所稱讚的像個仙女下凡，所有女人美麗的條件她都具備了，不過有一點倒不能不説是缺點，她説起話來從來不敢以眼睛向人，只是朝着地上瞪着，而且有時也上氣不接下氣地呑呑吐吐；總之看她説話的神氣是不痛快的，不過也許有人會從這中間領略到另一種風味，因此聽説還有幾個翩翩少年曾爲她害過相思病呢。</p>
<p>秀姑娘的父親是個香火道行的道士人很忠實而聰明，自幼就信奉菩薩，因此唱菩薩，打醮，就成了他的終身職業。他生有兩個女兒，三個兒子。秀姑娘是大的一個，從小就帮着母親勞動，小弟妹們的衣服，屎布，幾乎都是她一手包辦。她的脾氣很好，待人總是笑嘻嘻地從來不惡口駡人，不過她有一個奇怪而尋常的倍仰，那是不結婚！</p>
<p>事情是這樣發生的：當她十五歲的夏天，月經忽然來了，她的母親很高興，因爲這是發育完全的象徵，她不再擔心她是個石女（註二）了。然而秀姑娘對於這件事簡直煩惱到要自殺，因爲她覺得這東西不但　而且太麻煩，天氣又熱·褲子只能穿一條，稍不留心，鮮紅的血液會不管一切地跑了出來，給别人看見眞要笑掉牙齒，如果秀姑娘的母親知道了呢？那更了不得！因此她覺得月經這東西比洪水猛獸還可怕。她不知道這是女人生理上的變化，月經來時就會頭暈，目眩，四肢無力，有毛病的人更會肚子痛哪，腰疼哪，胃口不好，性情煩燥，種種病態一齊出來了。她只感到莫明其妙的煩，有時竟自言自語道：（要死就早點死了吧，女人眞不是人做的！）自由談</p>
<h3>哭</h3>
<p>昨天來了一個（笑），今天率興再來一個（哭）。雖説（哭）多少有點不吉利，而且與昨天所提倡的笑的總動員）似乎是恰相務盾。但處在目前這樣可泣而又可歌的大時代裏，如其准許我們笑，便誰也不能禁止我們哭，只要我們自己不怕觸霉頭。</p>
<p>講到哭，也正和笑一樣，可以分成多少種類：華周杞梁之妻善哭其夫，那是寡婦悽怨的哭：賈寳玉偶然一句兩句話不對頭觸惱了妹妹，林黛玉便掩面而哼哼喞喞，那是打情駡俏的哭；曾子死了，曾晳竟因哭子而喪其明的哭，那是發動自天性的眞摰的哭：楚覇王在烏江别虞姬高唱（虞兮虞兮奈若何）而聲滬俱下的哭，那是英雄末路悲壯的哭：還有那風流皇帝陳後主向人訴苦説（此間日以涙洗面），那是追懷往盛的抑鬱的哭；至於像阿斗太子在晋武帝前面背完了，（先人墳墓遠在岷蜀····）因爲没有眼涙便緊緊地閉上兩眼以代哭，那便是　孩子的假哭，卑卑不足道了。</p>
<p>然而我們不要輕看了哭呵！哭之爲用·正大矣哉！大到有意想不到之效力！你看那楚國的申包胥，只消一哭三天，便打動了秦國的（義憤）｜｜但也許是發慈悲，義軍一出，已經亡了的楚國便得因而復國，這種哭就不同凡響了！嚇，你只想，一哭三天，該多麽難！這種哭，莫説是秦國，就是天地也該爲之動容，而鬼神有知，也該陪着他哭，才算是合乎天理與人情！不過，申包胥究竟已經是（古之人）了，而現在的世界又似乎和（七雄時代）也有點兩樣。所以當去年日本兵一聲不響地奪取了我們東北半邊天下的時候，雖説某公曾因之而（悲憤痛哭），而某帥也曾因之而（泣不成聲），但究竟不能一哭三天；因爲不能一哭三天，所以雖説兩公的哭是發乎中，而凝爲涙，精忠誠摰，有天在上可以作證，但國際聯盟究竟似乎比秦國差得太遠，始終不肯一發慈悲，把日本那張貪婪的口扳開，要回我們金甌無缺的東北來！</p>
<h3>自紐約説到倫敦</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>假如有誰自紐約來到倫敦，而將這兩個都市的生活加以比較，我想他一定感覺着極大的分别。</p>
<p>第一便是生活的弛緩，如電話，書信的遞寄，交通機關，旅館裏的茶房，商店裡的朝奉，其動作都是不急不忙的。這以快刀斬亂麻的美國人比較起來，我們可以説倫敦全在睡眠之中。第二是倫敦有着各色各樣的階級：旅館中，飲食店裡，商店中，馬路上，我們可發見數不淸的階級。至於衙門裡面更不必説。這是他們的歷史，傳統，習慣，完全没有紐約那樣表面上平等的風釆。任何事物全没有統一或違絡，一切都是不必要的複雜。第三便是器械的設備不全。在紐約，因爲近代的科學文明的進步，一切物質方面的享受，都迅速的趨於完全；反之，倫敦的生活，其科學文明，似乎是落後一世紀的，使我們在日常生活上感覺非常缺乏。第四便是人民性情的凝滯。這比較遇事敏捷，爽直犀利的美國人，眞是落後。譬如説話罷，他們老是唔唔吱吱的，不能立刻黑白分明，簡直會使人氣死。第六便是難堪的憂鬱。這會使你整個的神經覺着沉重。譬如你在紐約那樣晴爽的空氣中呼吸過的而突然跑到倫敦這樣潤濕的隂曇的天氣中來，你能不感覺過分憂悒嗎？假如自己覺得在紐約時有如在靑空中翱翔的雲雀，那末在倫敦却有如在黑暗中摸索的夜鶯了。</p>
<p>總之，紐約的生活是勤快的，奮鬭的，而倫敦却是悠長的懶惰的了。</p>

<h3>原恕</h3>
<p>— 剏</p>
<p>憑着在我靈魂裏再生的你模糊的倩影，我覺得我最喜歡的還是你。</p>
<p>你雖曾毁壞我靑春的黎明，但我却到死也不願忘記你的兩眼，更不能忘的是你那淸脆又溫柔的聲音，牠異乎尋常地深入我的心坎，我的胸兒許久許久地顫慄不停好像一具受着纖指撥動的孤獨的　瑟。</p>
<p>啊！我認議許多女人，她們有着鮮麗的朱唇她們的額兒嬌美，她們的言詞柔媚。</p>
<p>我的朋友會對你説我爲着她們歌吟，但我的母親會告訴你我爲着你而哭泣。</p>
<p>我哭，但我的眼滬已漸稀少；</p>
<p>我那時號泣，我如今涕零；</p>
<p>隨後年紀來了，眼睛會變得吝嗇，有一天我的哀愁只不過是一種煩悶。</p>
<p>是啊，爲着你曾摧折我的靑春之花，當我老了的時候，我也許會要恨你。</p>
<p>我希望你的倩影永遠在我的靈魂裏再生！希望憶起你的眼睛時，我可深深地原恕你！</p>

<h3>懸垂飛行鐵道</h3>
<p>— 瓊</p>
<p>我們現在所處的是Ｓpeedy時代，一切事業都尙速力。電車，火車，汽車，地下鐵道車之外，還有更快的飛機。</p>
<p>當然，現在的飛機日臻安全，比較以前確是進步百倍。然而萬一機件損害，仍不免有墜落之危，同時亦受着天氣的束縛，如刮風下雨對於飛行都是不利的。所以現在又有高速度而十分安全的懸垂式的飛行電車之發明。這是一種不受天氣阻礙而在空中行走的交通利器。</p>
<p>縣垂飛行鐵道，英名爲ＲailＰlane，由英人佐治伯寗發明。最近乘英國交通會議之機會，乃得實行試騐。因爲是試騐，當然不能過於關足馬力，但）小時仍有百九十基羅米突的速度。無疑義的，這是一可驚的Ｓpeedy了。</p>
<p>至於其建設費也很低廉，據伯寗氏的計算，如以千基羅米突爲單位，只需要十五萬元乃至十八九萬元，（每一英里約爲二十五萬至三十萬元）所以比較四百萬元一哩的地下鐵道與五十萬元一哩的市外鐵道以及七十萬乃至百萬元的市内電車，確是便宜多了。</p>
<p>這種飛行車不僅有着上述的驚人的速度，而且是十分安全的。原來是將車箱架空的吊在鐵軌上，下面還有一層安全網，卽萬一發生機件的危險，亦不致於下墜。</p>
<p>車箱的外形和内部裝置，，都與飛船相彷彿。前後均裝有推進機，以增進飛行的速度。</p>
<h3>我所看見的法國女子</h3>
<p>— 冰之女士</p>
<p>一提起法國女子·我想許多人一定以爲這是世界上頂奢侈·頂放蕩的女子罷。我没有去法國以前，也是這樣想；但我在法國住了幾年之後，才知道這是一個很大的錯誤。</p>
<p>法國女子愛俏是有的，但奢侈却絶對　不上。大戰以後，大部分法國女子因爲死了丈夫或找不到丈夫的原故，都得自食其力，她們的生活都非常艱苦，她們不會奢侈，固不必説；就是生活寛裕不必在外面做事的婦女，也都過着非常儉樸的生活。一切家務大槪都是主婦自己處理，很少僱用僕役的。我在巴黎和地城來往的幾位敎授家裏都没有僕人，敎授失人每天淸早起來自己提着一個袋子上市場買這樣買那樣·回來之後便收拾房子，擦地板，做菜，洗衣····從早忙到晚，没有一刻休息。以視中國女子，丈夫賺到四五十元一月，便僱用娘姨，自己飽食終日，一事不做，那眞不知勤儉到那裏法了呢！</p>
<p>並且法國女子還有一種使人佩服的地方：就是她們並不把工作看作一種恥辱的事情。我在巴黎的時候，曾經由友人介紹在一個音樂敎師家裏住過幾個月。這位音樂敎師是一個快要四十歲的老處女，她和她的老母親住在一塊。她是敎鋼琴的，每月可得一千佛郎左在的束修，以外·她還可後月得三百佛郎的房租。法國人把房子租給人家的時候，不像中國人一樣，祇給你一間光零零的房子，什麽都不管。他們不但要供給房客的一切用具，而且還得服事房客。我住的這位音樂敎師家裏旣没有僕人，於是家裏什麽事都是這位音樂敎師自己動手。每天早上在她那些學鋼琴的女學生來到之前，她得替我整理床舖，抺灰，擦地板，倒面水，做種種粗事。這在中國女子眼中看來一定是很奇怪的事罷，一個音樂敎師替别人倒面水，擦地板！但在法國女子眼中，這實在平常得很。那位老小姐替我收拾房子的時候，跳來跳去，有時還低聲歌唱着，絶没有感覺這是可恥的事。她倒完了面水，擦好了地板，再去敎别人的鋼琴，一點也没有失去她的身份。我覺得這種精神是中國女子應當趕緊效法的。</p>
<p>再説中國人大都以爲法國女子是放蕩的，這也是一種錯誤。在巴黎忽忽遊了幾天的外國人祇看見坐在咖啡店裏的那些妖怪般的女子，便説法匣女子如何如何的放蕩，這未免近於武斷。據我的觀察·法國女子和歡洲其他各國的女子比較起來，要算頂拘謹守舊的女子。中流以上人家的少女便不大容易和男子接近，出門常常有人陪伴着；就是大學裏面的法國女生，也没有其他各國女生那樣隨便和男生交際。實在説來，拿法國女子和中國的所謂摩豋女士｜常是晚上和男朋友跳舞跳到深夜才回家的摩豋女士比較，（放蕩）兩字完全不能加在法國女子身上的。</p>
<p>我寫這篇短文並不在表揚法國女子的好處·我不過因爲在海外住了多年回來，看見中國婦女（這裏當然拿中等階級的婦女做標凖）裝飾方面固然比以前進步得多，可是實際上，不曾受過敎育的，姑不論；受過敎育的·除了極少數之外，還不是只知道打麻將，吃大菜，跳舞，看電影嗎？這種現象實在使人傷心，所以不覺的便寫了這一大堆剌耳的話。</p>

<h3>時代与愛的歧路三</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>眞是好機會。曾敎授回香港去了，|看他的第二個太太去了。要兩禮拜才得回來吧。老林，眞是個好機會啊！</p>
<p>（你眞是胡説覇道！）</p>
<p>海泉還是繼續着想，莫非老唐眞有本領看出了自己的内心麽？自己儘可以發誓，對於鶴子夫人並没有懹半點超越常軌的期望。不過近來自己的腦海中，時常有鶴子夫人的影兒在出没，這確是實在的事實。至於她的俏影何以會闖進他的神經中　裏來，他也莫明其妙。並且她的影兒的出没是日見日的頻繁，影兒的色彩也日見日的澹厚。</p>
<p>（近幾天來自己不是很想早點放學回去麽？目的明明是想看見她。····）</p>
<p>想到這點，他又有點自愧起來了。</p>
<p>（·····莫非這就是所謂戀愛麽？）</p>
<p>他坐在車子上思想了好半天，才覺得周圍的氛圍氣有點冷了。上半天還是好好的晒着熱烈的太陽。吃過了中飯，天空上便密密地佈滿了深灰色的亂雲了。初冬的寒風，一陣陣地席捲着馬路上的塵砂，從側面向他打來。他的身上便起了一陣微顫，同時感着臉上是粗澁澁的。</p>
<p>他從褲袋裏抽出手來，摸了摸雙頰。</p>
<p>曾敎授的公館是在F橋的北首，那座九層樓洋房公寓的正後面。車子在曾公館的門首停住了。海泉才付過車錢，正要按電鈴，鶴子夫人已經從裏面出來，把外層的鐵扉打開了。</p>
<p>（林先生，冷麽？）</p>
<p>（想不到天氣變得這樣快，曾伯母。）</p>
<p>（啊呀，又呌我伯母了。我眞不願意就這樣老）。</p>
<p>她笑着説了後，跟了他走進來。才踏進客堂，就感着一陣暖氣，原來堂屋裏的火爐上了煤，燒起來了。</p>
<p>（今天來了不及了。明天要替你房裏裝一個火爐才了）。</p>
<p>他呌他坐下來後，這樣説。</p>
<p>（不要火爐。我房裏不要火爐。我不怕冷）。</p>
<p>（林先生，我聽見你的老師説過，上海比你們南方氣候冷得多，不燒火爐，不能過冬）。海泉也覺得上海的天氣比南國的冷得多。照隂歷算起來，還只是址月中旬，但像南邊十二月的氣候一樣了。</p>
<p>（裝火爐固然是所希望的。不過恐怕要多花錢。火爐的錢是有限的吧。不過要燒煤，過一個冬，確昌不容易的負担。自己家裏人多，開支大了，父親的收入，每年僅僅夠開銷。幸得由姊夫津貼一點。不然，怎麽能夠到上海來進大學呢。）</p>
<p>他正在痴相；忽然又聽見鶴子夫人在呌他。</p>
<p>（林先生，你有幾封信呢。儘顧着和你説話，把你的信忘記了。）</p>
<p>她説着立起身來，走到窗口下的書桌傍邊，打開抽屜，取了三封信出來，交給海泉。</p>
<p>他接過來一看，一封是老父親寄來的家信，一封是姊姊寄來的，一封是姊夫的妹妹劉佩珠寄來的。父親的信最平凡，只是説年假如果可能，務必回來鄉里，看看家人，第一因爲老祖母十分希望他回去和大家歡歡喜喜過一個新年。其次姊姊的信却有幾分使他驚異，因爲這封信不是像前一次的從廣州寄來的，而是從香港寄來的。</p>
<p>（他們的家搬到香港去了麽）？</p>

<h3>是什麽一回事？</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>故宮博物院自發生盜賣案後·内幕的眞相·究屬如何·眞是丈二長和尙·令人摸不着頭腦·究屬盜賣呢還是非盜賣？如其盜賣·則盜賣者究爲何人？并且盜賣的物·究屬三十餘萬呢·還是七十餘抑不止七十餘萬？所賣出之物果然廢物而帶封建時代色彩的呢·還是並非廢物·亦不帶封建時代的色彩者·亦被他們盜賣？此案了多時·還是一個莫名其五聖廟最近監察院雖派員前去調</p>
<p>查·預備彈劾·恐怕亦難澈底弄清·這樣一件嚴重的盜賣·等於無頭命案非請偵探專家福爾摩斯來偵探一番不可</p>
<p>在此檔分案未曾解决以前·突復有故宮古物遷移洛陽之説·盜賣古物是一件事·遷移古物又爲一件事·但這兩檔分案·其中是否有連帶性呢·還是完全無連帶性？門外漢天然更是莫測高深·難明眞相·但據近日報载·關於遷移古物消息·頗爲離奇·據二十四日北平電·北平各界·反對古物遷洛·曾發表五項理由·言之頗爲成理·而三十日又見北平兩電·一電易培　否認故宮古物遷洛·一電褚民誼調故宮古物將移洛陽·到底主張遷移者何人？更以何理由而必要遷洛？而主張反對者又爲何人？所説五項理由·是否確係眞正事實？這樣的悶葫蘆·非快到　帝廟去求一擋籤·恐不容易打破呢</p>
<p>總之·「漫　海盜」·古人所忌·現在我並不怪别的·我祗怪我國古物太多·古物太好·不但外國人看了垂涎·即中國人大家想轉念頭·眞是犯俗語的兩句話「告化子捉藏無落放」「黑眼珠看見白銀子」我甚爲這些東西擔心·甚爲這些東西可惜</p>

<p>「是！是我不去了·」瘦青年的頭慢慢地垂下去了·眼睛裏含着淚·嘴裏説着·就垂頭喪氣的出去了</p>
<p>接着又走進來一個穿西裝的少年夥計·履聲</p>

<h3>同情者（二續）</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>（打麥塲上）</p>
<p>在王老二的大門口，有一片打麥塲，土地是用石滖得平平的，光光的，這是爲了打麥之時·有碎粒落在地上妸以很容易的掃了起來。打麥塲前方，園了一　樹·對外便是一日清水池塘，到了晚上　　由水面上　　，很　凉　這裏就是個絶好的乘凉之所。所以在太陽下了山以後，吃過了晚飯，王老三便提一桶熱水，帶着澡盆，在塘邊一　矮樹下洗澡。洗完了澡，換上一條舊而又破的褲子，踏着一雙破得只剩了半截的鞋，然後搬一座竹床横在風頭上休息。換下來的褲子和剩水，自有他燒鍋的去料理。這一天晚上，有很大的月亮，照見打麥塲上猶如幕了一　薄雪。王老二的妻正提了水桶澡盆，經過打麥塲·向大門裏面走去，恰是孟國寳由旁邊走來，　　的呌了一聲老二。王老二聴到是孟先生的聲音，他睡在竹床上，一個翻身跳了起來，便道，呵喲！孟先生，請坐請坐，難得來的貴客，孟國寳道，什麽貴客，我家和你家，還隔不到一百步路，王老二將手上的芭蕉扇，扇了扇竹床，笑道，請坐請坐，孟國寳説了句不客氣，在竹床上坐了下來，王老二却對他妻道，快些燒水泡茶，炒一碟南瓜子來，他妻却很響亮的答應了一個哦字，王老二很客氣，他怕兩人坐在一張竹床上。熱天有些不合宜，就在竹床對面一張石滖上坐着。孟國寳笑道，老二，剛才我看到你那位嫂夫人，和你端了澡盆提桶進去，這樣看起來，不光是燒鍋，還和你作雜事哩，你呌她作燒鍋的，不是包括不全嗎？王老二笑道，怎麽白天説的話，孟先生還記得？孟國寳笑道，因爲你和嫂夫人説話，也不呌她什麽，只把話來説重一些，她就明白了。中國人眞是奇怪，夫妻説話，彼此不呌名字，頂多就呌一個喂字。至親者莫如矣妻，哥哥兄弟，姐姐嫂嫂，家庭之間，什麽都能呌，爲什麽到了夫妻頭上，倒稱呼不得了。我因爲這個，所以又想起日裏的話來。王老二打了個哈哈笑起來道，那是笑話了。難道説，我就燒鍋的長，燒鍋的短，這樣的呌着她不成？説到這裏，他的新媳婦，正由大門裏搬了個方登子出來，聴丁這話，低低的駡道·你又胡説八道，似乎她也很忌諱燒鍋的這個名詞。她只説了這四個字，悄悄的將那方登子，在竹床面前放着，接着就拿了瓦茶　和兩雙飯碗來。王老二起身·斟了兩碗茶，笑道，碗是不好，不遇這苶葉倒是我在山裏帶來的一些殺兩尖子，在城裏恐怕不容易買到。孟國寳端起碗來喝了一口，雖然苶裏有點清香，然而碗裏有些菜子油味，不作聲的，就放下。王老二兩手捧了那碗，如猴子盤桃一般，縮手縮脚的在那裏喝得很有味。他媳婦又出來了·依然是不作聲·將一碟新炒的南瓜子，放在方登子上。孟國寳看她像怕人又不像怕人·鄕下婦人却另有一種風味。月光下見她換了件粗夏布褂子，高高的捲了兩隻袖子·耳朶的髮发下，倒捶了三四朶鄕下人呌着洗澡花的草苿莉，看她衣服上沒有一點皺紋，似乎也是洗了澡之後，新換的衣服了。她　　瓜子之後，便不再進大門去了，拿了她手上的蒲扇，將台　上的衣土　　　　也就在那台皆石上坐下。（未完）</p>

<h3>龍虎鬬的作者佛蘭克布格FrankBuck軼聞</h3>
<p>— 寒</p>
<p>誰看見南京大戲院『龍虎　』的，都能覺得虎，豹，蛇，　等等毒蟲猛獸，被佛蘭克布格（ＦrankBuck）生擒活捉得非常便當，有些希怪。但據佛蘭克自已説，捉野獸確是很簡便，並沒有什麽希奇的，第一你祇要懂得野獸的脾氣，第二你須有膽量，有體力，能隨機應變。佛蘭克無疑地像一個粗野的人。他在極危險的時候，却能極鎭靜，但文化的生產物，如電話，地底鐵道等，反使他感覺不安。有一次他在船上，有一隻猩猩從籠裏逃了出來，走近他的身體，佛蘭克在間不容髪的當兒，一拳打在猩猩的牙床上，就把猩猩打倒了。那時非但槍拿不出來，就是一轉身的工夫都沒有。所以佛蘭克確是一個身心一樣敏捷的人。</p>
<p>佛蘭克這種體力與本領，是那裏來的？恐怕是他的父親遺傳給他的。他的父親，本來是個獵人，到了八十四歲，還是每天要出去釣魚的。佛蘭克八歲的時候，就以捉捕響尾蛇爲生。他捉了這種毒蛇，賣給走江湖賣藥的，五毛錢一條。這種江湖醫生，買了去可以配藥，據説可以治風濕之症；這一點倒與中國南方社會所見的，正相符合。</p>
<p>佛蘭克到了十七歲，就「心懐大志」要捉野獸。他偷偷兒從家裏跑了出來，先到芝加哥。那兒有一個小飯店，他就當了一位小茶房，他辛辛苦苦的工作，等到積聚了幾個錢，他就到南美洲去了。他在南美洲，以捉鳥爲生。捉了鳥就連到美國去賣。這樣，他的捕捉生涯，就一天一天的興隆起來。後來他居然能在東方的新加坡，設立了一個機關。這就是他向新加坡四週一帶森林獵取野獸的開始。</p>
<p>佛蘭這種生活，利息很大。有些鳥可以賣一千金元一隻。一只象可以賣到二千五百金元以上。馬戲團　動物園，以及各種私人花園等等，都是他的出品銷塲之處。他是美國德克薩斯州人，所以德克薩斯州都會中的動物園裏的野獸，一大半是佛蘭克供給的，據説珍禽異獸，有七十二種之多。</p>
<p>照佛蘭克自已所説的，他怕那大蟒與老虎爭鬬之先，曾等了三個禮拜，纔得到一個好機會，因爲他發見那條長蟲的時候，牠剛剛呑了一雜野猪。這隻野猪，在蟒肚裏，至少要十一天纔能消化，所以要再餓了，　纔出去尋食，纔能與老虎相鬬。但大蟒與老虎鬬了許多，並不兩敗惧傷，各能『全師而退』，這事有些蹊蹺。但要説是假的，却又是那麽活神活現。</p>
<p>佛蘭克現年四十二歲，身長六尺，相貌係很粗魯的，但他却有一位很漂亮的夫人，據説他們結緍以後，從來沒有吵過嘴。這位夫人是他的第二次妻子。因爲佛蘭克在十九歲的時候，已經娶過一位比他年長十歲的婦人。但後來那位夫人，自覺老妻少夫，於心不安，所以退居朋友之列，於是佛蘭克就續娶了這位年輕貌美的。他們還有一個千金，現在已經八個月了。</p>

<p>汪福慶在電影界裏，已有十餘年的歷史了。他自創設了大東金獅公司，其第一部出品「春風楊柳，」即將完竣，僅餘少數外景，尙未拍好。日前他特地派人到夏佩珍家裏，呌夏在三天後到大東，然後一齊往蘇州去攝外景：因爲他希望這部「春風楊柳，」要在最短期内竣事。</p>
<p>但他並不是爲欲趕這部「春風楊柳，」實在是因爲他在那「春風楊柳」竣事之後，想到美國去實地考察一下：至於公司裏的一切事務，他説他的表弟沈志遠能代理．</p>

<h3>International League of Nations Handling of the Sino-Japanese Dispute's Future Uncertain; Organization Mediation Committee Said to Be Gradually Gaining Influence</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Special Committee of Nineteen has transferred the discussion of the Lytton Report to the League of Nations Assembly. Therefore, before Tuesday, this place will present an appearance of superficial calm but internal tension. According to the opinions of seasoned observers, one of the most important pages in the history of the League of Nations will begin here. The next few days will be an extremely important period, which will not only show the League of Nations' ability to cope with this unprecedented problem, but also determine the degree of cooperation that can be expected from the United States. Although the discussions at the meeting will involve the entire scope of the Lytton Report, the most noteworthy will be the motions in the Assembly and the resolutions to be handled by the Committee of Nineteen. As far as what the United States can endorse, the most crucial point is the League of Nations' attitude towards "Manchukuo." General opinion seems to believe that there will be a decision not to recognize "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>Another important issue is the decision on the deadline for submitting the final report under Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. This point has been raised by Dr. Yen Hui-ching and will be one of the first things the Committee of Nineteen must decide after the Assembly debate.</p>
<p>It is heard that Japan will continue to issue a statement on Tuesday's meeting to explain its attitude. It is widely believed that this statement will be a further step than the previous one, not only discussing past events, but also involving Japan's hopes for the future. However, Japan may not make any suggestions when stating its future hopes.</p>
<p>The disturbances caused by the war debt problem and the new attitude of the United States towards disarmament can be seen in today's particularly uninteresting meeting. The only event in the meeting was Dr. Yen Hui-ching's request to resolve the disguised wartime situation. The Committee of Nineteen, like the Executive Yuan which adjourned on Monday, transferred this difficult problem to the Assembly for resolution on Tuesday.</p>
<p>European and American governments seem to be rushing around in all directions, unable to take care of themselves. What can be determined is that the small countries will speak out against Japan. There is currently a four-point proposal, which is: 1. Pass the historical part of the Lytton Report; 2. Set a deadline for resolution; 3. Reaffirm the promise not to recognize "Manchukuo"; 4. Establish a mediation committee, with representatives from the United States and Russia. However, judging from the current situation, it is still doubtful whether the major powers can agree to this proposal. (Reuter's dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The nineteen expositions on Chinese affairs written by Gu Weijun when he accompanied the investigation team in the Northeast are now desired by many representatives of the League of Nations to read, in order to understand the situation in the Far East. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now printing 100 copies and sending them to Geneva, to be distributed by our country's representatives. This exposition will also be distributed to the envoys and chargés d'affaires of various countries stationed in China in Beijing for reference. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Special Assembly Agenda</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Special Assembly will convene at 11 a.m. on the 6th. The order will be as follows: first, the chairman announces the opening of the meeting, then Chinese representative Yen Hui-ching will deliver a speech, followed by Japanese representative Matsuoka. The Chinese government's opinion may be submitted at this time. After the speeches by the Chinese and Japanese representatives, the two representatives will not discuss, and representatives of various countries will express their opinions. However, the speaking countries have not been determined. The speeches of the representatives of various countries will continue for at least two or three days. Finally, the Chinese and Japanese representatives will explain or refute the speeches of the representatives of various countries. The Sino-Japanese issue may be transferred to the Committee of Nineteen again, and the committee will report to the Special Assembly, and then organize a mediation committee including Chinese and Japanese representatives, citing Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the regulations to study solutions. (Nichi Ren News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, Matsuoka Yosuke's speech at the Executive Council focused more on past facts, strongly arguing that the advance and occupation of the three northeastern provinces was an act of self-defense. However, the impression of various countries still cannot relax Japan's ambition to annex Manchuria and Mongolia. The so-called puppet organization is only a temporary cover for the world's eyes and ears. In view of this, the Japanese representative may change its previous strategy at the Assembly on the 6th, and explain step by step the steps Japan should take in the future, seeking the forgiveness of the small countries, and no longer suspecting that the three northeastern provinces are the second Korea. However, whether the content of the speech can completely cover up the current reality in the three northeastern provinces is something that the Japanese themselves are not sure about. (Hua Lian News Agency Tokyo dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Mediation Committee Seeks Compromise Plan</p>
<h3>Work Begins After Assembly Passes</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen believes that its actions are useless before the League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly expresses its views. Therefore, except for Chairman Hymans convening the Assembly, the committee will not meet for the time being, but will prepare to draft a report, the conclusion of which is: first, not to recognize Manchukuo; second, to invite Soviet Russia and the United States to participate in the organization of a small committee to seek mediation and compromise plans for China and Japan. This mediation committee will begin work as soon as the report drafted by the Committee of Nineteen is adopted by the Assembly.

<p>Direct Negotiations Between China and Japan?</p>
<p>International Mediation Committee?</p>
<p>League of Nations Sends Another Investigation Team?</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to information received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from Geneva, the League of Nations is gradually aware that the Sino-Japanese problem cannot be resolved quickly. In particular, the major powers tend to wait and see, knowing that there is no other way but to delay the resolution. The General Assembly, which will convene from the 6th, will first allow the small countries to express their opinions, and then entrust the review of the report to the Committee of Nineteen. It is not known what kind of solution the committee will be able to reach. However, during this wait-and-see period, the following three options are being considered as intermediate measures: 1. Direct negotiation recommendation: The League of Nations advises China and Japan to start direct negotiations to seek a solution to the problem. The League of Nations appoints a neutral member to attend as a supervisor to mediate from the sidelines.</p>
<p>2. Mediation Committee: In order to ease the claims of China and Japan, the Committee of Nineteen, with the addition of the United States and Russia, is the main body to formulate a mediation plan, set up a mediation committee to wait and see the situation in Manchuria, and discuss a solution plan in about two months.</p>
<p>3. On-site re-investigation committee: In order to inspect the independence of Manchuria and the situation of Japan's recognition after the Lytton Report was written, diplomats from major council countries are enlisted to set up an investigation committee. The League of Nations will review it again based on this report. The informal opinions of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on these three cases are generally as follows: 1. If the League of Nations can advance to recognizing Manchuria, even if it waits and sees temporarily without rushing to a resolution, it is a wise policy. Therefore, the Japanese government will not oppose this as long as it does not touch its established policy. 2. In view of its absolute opposition to the participation of third countries, which is Japan's established policy, the direct negotiations advocated by the League of Nations may be difficult to achieve. 3. Except for the Mediation Committee of China and Japan, it is absolutely opposed from the principle of rejecting the participation of third countries. 4. If the committee in the third case is investigating the new situation after the report is submitted, although it does not object, its establishment must always respect the principles of Japan.

<h3>Japan's Attitude Towards the International Committee; Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Approval and Disapproval</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to information received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the establishment of an international committee is currently more powerful in the League of Nations Secretariat and major countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that it is wiser to hand over the Sino-Japanese dispute to the committee and take countermeasures after observing its progress. However, the committee's intentions and its composition deserve special attention for the following reasons: 1. If the committee does not have representatives from China and Japan, it will be like a mediation committee, and China and Japan will be in the position of defendants, so it is opposed. 2. Even if both China and Japan join the committee, it is still opposed in accordance with the established policy of excluding the participation of third countries. 3. However, the composition and function of the committee is to investigate the affairs of "Manchukuo," only report to the League of Nations, and have the nature of waiting and seeing for a considerable period of time, then it does not object.

<p>[P de Valera Issues Important Speech</p>
<p>Key to Whether the Far East Problem Can Be Solved</p>
<p>Lies in Whether Countries Have the Determination to Maintain Treaties</p>
<p>Dublin The Chairman of the League of Nations Executive Council, de Valera, returned from Geneva and told people today that the Special Assembly of the League of Nations this time may not be able to solve the Manchurian problem, and it will still be transferred to the Committee of Nineteen. At that time, the Committee of Nineteen will conduct a detailed study of the Lytton Report and prepare a new resolution, and then submit it to the next League of Nations Assembly. This kind of procedure takes a lot of time, but he believes that the interests of both China and Japan can be preserved during this period.</p>
<p>De Valera also said that the member states of the League of Nations have not yet stated their positions, but if the countries decide to firmly maintain the League of Nations Covenant and other peace and non-aggression treaties, then this matter can be resolved.</p>
<p>De Valera also said in an interview with reporters that he is currently planning a method to find out the true wishes of the people of Manchuria. He does not advocate convening a citizens' assembly, but believes that the people of Manchuria should decide their relationship with China on their own. He also said that he believes that the future of the League of Nations is entirely tied to its actions on this case and whether it is prepared to firmly maintain its principles.

<h3>Ding Shiyuan Attempts to Attend the Meeting</h3>
<p>The Secretary-General of the League of Nations Does Not Recognize Him</p>
<p>The Japanese Representative Expresses Regret</p>
<p>(Geneva) Ding Shiyuan and Bolang Sheng, the representatives of "Manchukuo" in Geneva, were notified by the "Foreign Minister" of "Manchukuo" to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, to send Ding Shiyuan as Puyi's representative and Bolang Sheng as the representative of the "Manchukuo government." Drummond only issued the notification because "Manchukuo" is a non-member country, but did not announce the contents of the notification. Therefore, the Japanese representative regretted it and tried to unofficially convey the contents to relevant countries, so that the League of Nations and representatives of various countries would regard the two representatives as representatives of "Manchukuo" at any time.

<p>(Beiping) A certain party received a telegram from Zhalantun saying that after the Japanese army launched a general offensive, it pressed on Zhalantun with a large army. Because the weather was extremely cold, the Japanese army's movements were slow and suffered repeated setbacks. Heavy fighting has been going on for days. On the 29th of last month, the Japanese army's Mota Detachment and our Zhang Yuting Brigade fought fiercely in the Yaokule area. Japanese soldiers died all over the field, and our army also suffered casualties. Four Japanese planes bombed Nianzishan and were shot down by our army.

<h3>The Inside Story of the Launch of the Guizhou War Is Not Unrelated to the Sichuan War</h3>
<p>Wang Jialie Withdraws from Guiyang and Stations in Qianxi</p>
<p>He Zizhong's Reinforcements Arrive and a Battle Is Inevitable</p>
<p>Mao Guangxiang and You Guocai Govern Guizhou</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since You Guocai drove away Wang Jialie in the Guizhou War, news in the capital has been silent. A certain Guizhou person talked about the main force of the Guizhou army being the 25th Army, which was reorganized from the Sichuan-Guizhou border clearing and suppression troops of Xiong Yibin in the early Republic of China. The former chairman of Guizhou, Zhou Xicheng, was Xiong's cousin. After the success of the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition, Zhou Xicheng responded and changed the flag, leading the 25th Army to preside over Guizhou's politics. At that time, Mao Guangxiang, Wang Jialie, and You Guocai were division commanders in Zhou's army. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, Li Sang launched an army to resist Zhou. Zhou Xicheng was wounded and killed in battle. Mao, Wang, and You occupied their respective territories. The three are all from the same ancestral home. After Zhou Xicheng's death, Mao Guangxiang had a close relative relationship with Zhou and became the chairman of Guizhou, and was appointed by the central government as the commander-in-chief of the 18th Route Army. Wang Jialie led the 25th Army and was stationed in Qianxi, Xiangbian. You Guocai, as deputy army commander and commander of the 2nd Division, was stationed in Anshun. In terms of kinship, Wang Jialie is Mao Guangxiang's uncle. In Guizhou Province, in addition to the Mao, Wang, and You factions, Xiong Yibin's potential influence is also considerable. When Mao Guangxiang was in power, Xiong stayed in Beijing to mediate for him and served as a counselor to the National Government, and had close ties with Hu Hanmin. Mao and Wang had a marriage relationship with Xiong, while You was his student. Xiong's words were enough to sway the situation in Guizhou. After Wang Jialie became chairman, You Guocai felt that he had made a contribution and hoped to gain real benefits. Later, he colluded with Mao, and had long had plans to overthrow Wang. When the Sichuan War broke out, Liu Xiang blockaded Yuguan and Liu Wenhui's military supplies were cut off, so he colluded with Wang Jialie to pass through his territory, but it had to pass through You Guocai's defense zone. Liu Xiang learned that You and Mao were doing their best to make friends and recruited Mao to cooperate in overthrowing Wang, so the war broke out. Jiang Zaizhen's division of Mao's army first sent Yuan's regiment to advance into Wujiang. Wang Jialie sent a team to meet him. After contact, Wang used the name of suppressing Jiang Zaizhen, because Mao had the title of commander-in-chief, so it was not convenient to confront him, but in fact he was rejecting Mao. Mao, seeing the critical situation, sent a special telegram to You Guocai, who was stationed in Anshun, asking him to send troops immediately to capture Guiyang and disturb Wang's rear. After the overall situation was calmed down, he would support You as chairman. You then led his troops south and advanced towards Guiyang. Wang Jialie was attacked from both sides and knew that it was impossible, so he sent an urgent telegram to He Zizhong's division, which was stationed far away on the Hunan-Guizhou border, to come to his aid. At the same time, he withdrew from Guiyang, concentrated his strength, and moved his troops to Qianxi. You Guocai entered the provincial capital. Today, Mao and Wang's troops are still confronting each other, and there are no fierce battles. Wang retreated to Qianxi, waiting for He Zizhong's reinforcements. Once He's army arrives, a fierce battle is inevitable. Mao Guangxiang sent a long telegram to Beijing on the 2nd, attacking Wang Jialie for harming the province and the people, and strongly supporting You Guocai as the chairman of Guizhou. Guizhou people in Beijing hope that the central government will use swift measures and use reform methods to solve the problem, and divide the territories of Mao, Wang, and You to eliminate the civil war during the period of serious national crisis. A slight hesitation will not only devastate the entire Guizhou, but also greatly hinder the peaceful settlement of the Sichuan situation. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

All political affairs should be decided and presided over by the provincial chairman. The various departments should follow the chairman and be responsible for planning and implementation. The expenses of all departments should be based on the principle of unified collection and unified expenditure, and they should not create their own trends, which would lead to disputes.

<h3>The Noisy and Prominent Issue of European War Debts</h3>
<p>Several years ago, what caused a stir in Europe and shook the United States and Britain was the issue of reparations. However, in recent years, international attention has shifted and focused on the war debt issue. The so-called war debt issue refers to the situation during the previous World War when the Allied Powers needed military supplies and relied on the United States as their external treasury. Due to a lack of cash, the supply of military supplies was transformed into loans, which are the so-called war debts. Since the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles, defeated Germany has had to pay more than 20 billion gold marks in reparations annually. The income from the people's sweat and blood is provided to the government, which in turn pays it to the Allied Powers. The European Allied Powers must further provide a large part of their reparations income to the United States to pay for the principal and interest on war debts. The reason why the United States has become the world's largest creditor nation, and why New York has replaced London as the world's financial center, and why the power of American international financial capitalism has spread throughout the globe, is all thanks to the World War.</p>
<p>Any precise and reliable theory, golden rule, or regulation must have substantial economic conditions as its safeguard. Once times change, even if the speaker is eloquent, it will ultimately be impossible to overcome the changed reality. The reason why there was once a fierce debate over reparations, and today it is limited to the simple issue of war debts, is precisely because of this. After more than ten years of collecting reparations, Germany's finances have reached the point of exhaustion. However, after more than ten years of recuperation, Germany's national strength has gradually become unassailable. The Germans, therefore, calmly and unhurriedly informed the world that they were unable to pay reparations. If the European Allied Powers were to use force against Germany, it would only push Germany towards extremism. A single spark would ignite the whole plain, and quickly lead all of Europe to communism. Moreover, the internal suspicions and conflicts of the so-called European Allied Powers are becoming increasingly acute. Since Britain and Italy both want to support Germany to resist France, the so-called force is likely to only make France the target of public criticism.</p>
<p>Since the continued payment of reparations is not permitted by reality, the only option is to shift the focus to war debts. In this regard, US President Hoover adopted a strategy of seizing the initiative. Before the European nations issued communiqués requesting a postponement of war debt payments, he generously and voluntarily announced last winter a one-year moratorium on war debt payments. At that time, the whole world praised him, and the Soviet Union was shocked, considering it an unexpected move in the conflict of imperialism. Hoover's initial hope was also to use this to quickly revive the world from panic and restore prosperity, so that the life of capitalism could be extended indefinitely, and the payment of war debts would no longer be a problem. However, in the blink of an eye, the one-year period has expired, and the world's panic is still ongoing. The war debt issue has once again become a noisy and prominent issue. This is something that Hoover did not anticipate at the outset.</p>
<p>Speaking of the war debt issue, the most intense disputes between Europe and the United States involve two points. One is the linked relationship between war debts and reparations. The European Allied Powers believe that the payment of war debts should be conditional on the receipt of reparations. Therefore, if Germany is unable to continue paying reparations, the Allied Powers will also stop paying war debts. The United States has always maintained that reparations are one matter, and war debts are another matter, and that a public linked relationship between them should not be allowed. Recently, Britain has also stated that the receipt of war debt payments from France is a condition for the payment of all British war debts to the United States. This is because, during the war, the United States believed that Britain had stronger international credit and lent money to the Allied Powers mainly through Britain, which then re-lent it to other Allied Powers. Since there was already a linked relationship in fact during the lending, Britain is now proposing a linked relationship in return to counter the US position. Therefore, in addition to the linked relationship between war debts and reparations, there is also a linked relationship between war debts and war debts. The complexity of the situation is such that onlookers feel lost in a fog.</p>
<p>The second point of contention between Europe and the United States is the issue of individual resolution versus overall resolution. The Lausanne Conference is where the European powers united to deal with the American war debt issue. The United States is unwilling to see the European nations establish a united front, and also believes that this kind of united front is detrimental to negotiations. Therefore, it has repeatedly stated that it is willing to negotiate the war debt issue separately with any European Allied Power, but is unwilling to negotiate with any international group. In addition, it has sent important political and financial figures to lobby European countries in an attempt to break their united front. Observing the state of their mutual suspicion and rivalry, it is evident that the conflicts between the great powers can never be expected to be resolved.</p>
<p>However, can the united front among the European powers be maintained without being broken? From Britain's perspective, the huge sum of 30 million pounds is indeed a pity to spend. However, it ultimately does not want to see the once-incomparable British Empire become someone unable to repay debts. Therefore, it has to use the linked relationship of its claims on France as the reason for its inability to fully repay. The French, however, see this as a means for the British to shift the blame to France. The discord between Britain and France has already opened up the possibility of a rupture in the united front.</p>
<p>Based on our current observations, Britain and France will likely pay the war debts due this time after all, but with the condition that the war debts must be reorganized. At the international economic conference to be held next year, the United States may allow a reduction in war debts on the condition of disarmament. However, from the Hague Reparation Conference in 1930 to the suspension of war debts in 1931, the deterioration of the world situation is becoming more and more serious. Even if the war debt issue can be temporarily resolved, it is only a manifestation of temporarily patching up the situation.</p>

To report the recent situation of Mongolia to the Central Government and suggest how the government should handle Mongolian affairs in the future. Inner Mongolia is divided into East and West Mongolia. West Mongolia is peaceful, while East Mongolia is deeply affected by Japanese invasion and is extremely critical. They are currently organizing volunteer troops to resist the Japanese invaders. (2nd Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Kill Several Mongolian Military Leaders</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Liaojihei People's Support Association received news from Kailu: 1. It is recently heard that the Japanese are reprinting Fengpiao [currency issued by Fengtian province] with the words "Manchukuo" to use, and using this to entice and buy off Mongolians; 2. There are about several thousand Mongolian soldiers, currently stationed more than a hundred li northeast of Kailu. This spring, they fought with Cui Brigade, and a Japanese commander was killed. Currently, the Mongolian soldiers dare not act rashly; 3. After the Japanese commander was killed, the Japanese suspected that the Mongolians had killed the Japanese commander. They lured several Mongolian military leaders to the Japanese military headquarters, claiming that they were all unharmed, but that the Japanese alone had been killed, which was undoubtedly the work of the Mongolians. Therefore, they shot all the Mongolian leaders. Due to this relationship, the hearts and minds of the Japanese and Mongolians are scattered. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>It is Hoped that the Second Legislative Yuan Members Can Concurrently Serve on the Third</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The term of the second Legislative Yuan members expires on the 5th of this month. The production of the third session will be entrusted to the Third Plenary Session. Shao Yuanchong said that the second Legislative Yuan has completed its term, and according to the old organizational law, the president should request the Central Political Conference to appoint them. After the Central Government amended the organizational law, the number of members was 99, half appointed and half elected. Regarding the election plan, it is still under review by the Central Political Conference and will be submitted to the Third Plenary Session for final decision. Regarding the appointment, my opinion is that, in addition to those who have already resigned or have not been in the hospital for a long time in the second term, the remaining members should still concurrently serve on the third session. The number of members should not exceed half of the 99. The second term members have worked hard during their term and have accomplished a lot. Moreover, there are important regulations that are still being drafted. This is also a reason for concurrent appointment, he said. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>There is News of a Connection Between the Yuehan and Guangjiu Railways</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reports from the Ministry of Railways, the Guangdong provincial government has borrowed 15 million yuan from Hong Kong as an exchange condition for connecting the Yuehan and Guangjiu railways. The government has not yet received a formal report on this matter. However, if the connection between the two railways becomes a reality, it will be greatly detrimental to us. The Yuehan Railway is connected to the Pinghan Railway, and is a trunk line that runs vertically through our country from north to south. In the future, once the Shaozhu section is completed, the north-south transportation will be convenient, and goods can be transported by land. At that time, maritime transportation will be hit. In other words, Hong Kong's business will be taken away by Guangzhou in part. However, if the Yuehan Railway is connected to the Guangjiu Railway, the situation will be very different. After the connection, not only can goods from the north be directly transported to Kowloon for export without having to be shipped from Guangzhou, Guangzhou's business will gradually decline. At the same time, the economic power of the British in Hong Kong can penetrate deep into the interior. In the future, foreign goods will have to gather in Hong Kong. Thus, the construction of ports and Zhongshan port in our country's plan, even if successful, will lose its function. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>After the British Note Arrived in Washington, the White House Held Discussions All Night</p>
<p>A Statement Will Be Issued Again to Declare the Position of the United States</p>
<p>The Attitude Towards War Debts is Not Completely Without Room for Change</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 1st Telegram: The British war debt note was delivered to the US State Department by the British Embassy this morning. The full text is over 5,000 words long. Secretary of State Stimson, upon receiving it, immediately went to the White House to discuss the matter with the President. It is expected that after the full text is published, another statement will be issued to announce the US government's position. It is noted that President-elect Roosevelt will not be consulted this time, as Mr. Roosevelt once declared that the payment due on December 15th is "not his baby." Therefore, the government is respecting his words and will not send a copy of the British note in advance. The content will be notified to Mr. Roosevelt when it is published. As for the publication date, according to Deputy Secretary of State Castle, it will be around Friday. Currently, political and financial figures believe that Stimson's previous rejection of the suspension of payment note is not the final word of the US government on this issue, and there is absolutely no room for change.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 1st Telegram: Although US congressmen still declare that the people do not approve of the suspension of foreign debts, the US President, after receiving the British note, is quite hesitant. Although congressmen have received telegrams from various constituencies opposing concessions to debtor countries, prominent economists across the country have also telegraphed the government. However, the content has not been released. It is only known that the President, Secretary of State Stimson, and Secretary of the Treasury Mills considered and reviewed the matter late into the night. According to reports, after receiving the British note today, Stimson rushed to the White House to meet with the President. Later, he summoned Secretary of the Treasury Mills to the palace. The three held discussions for more than an hour. Although the details of the meeting were not released afterward, sources close to the government say that the British note strongly argued that if the United States insists on payment in mid-December, it will seriously damage world commerce. This has deeply impressed US government officials. In addition, many sources here say that the wording of the British note is extremely frank and complete.</p>
<h3>The Eloquent British Note</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st Telegram: The British note to the United States was sent out today. The note details the reasons why Britain believes that war debts and reparations are exacerbating the world's decline. It states that war debts and reparations are one of the main causes of the world's decline. The total amount of debts borrowed in the form of goods rather than money is as follows: The United States lent 2,055,000,000 yuan to the Allied countries, Britain lent 1,600,000,000 yuan to European Allied countries, and France lent 460,000,000 yuan to other Allied countries. The possibility of paying reparations and war debts temporarily exists only when investment funds flow from the United States to Europe. However, once an economic crisis breaks out, creditors withdraw their funds, and panic spreads. The credit on which private investment relies is destroyed by repeated shocks, and currency prices are unstable, and collapse is a concern. Although restrictions are imposed, they only increase disputes. If the causes of the disruption, such as intergovernmental debts, are not addressed, the world cannot even consider how to restore financial institutions. In the final analysis, international debts can only be repaid with goods. A 1925 US Treasury Department report established a principle that debtor countries must be allowed to place their finances and monetary systems on a stable basis. Today, the continued payment of war debts is completely contrary to this principle. Creditor countries only receive tens of millions of dollars, but this prolongs the world's turmoil, which is also of no benefit to creditor countries. It is the right of all governments in the world, especially the US and British governments, to work together on the first necessary step to prevent financial, economic, and political disasters. The United States lent 2,055,000,000 yuan, and Britain lent 1,600,000,000 yuan. For the benefit of taxpayers, the United States has recovered 434,000,000 yuan, while Britain has received nothing. Britain's debt to the United States accounts for 40% of the debt released by the United States, and Britain's payment to the United States accounts for 80% of the debt recovered by the United States. Moreover, what is given is actually the price of goods, and the price of goods paid today is double the price at the time of borrowing. Since the United States raised tariffs, British goods have been greatly affected. Britain has always been the best consumer of American goods, but if war debts continue to be paid, it will limit the British people's purchasing power of American goods. Furthermore, in terms of the Lausanne settlement, Britain has given up the debts owed by others while continuing to pay its own debts. This is absolutely unacceptable. Britain's foreign exchange reserves are currently insufficient to meet the December debt. The only other way is to pay the debt with gold bars, which would greatly sacrifice the Bank of England's gold reserves. The Bank of England's current holdings are only sufficient to meet its obligations as a financial center in London. The British government firmly believes that delaying the December debt payment will definitely promote world prosperity and recovery. Therefore, it asks the United States to discuss how to delay the payment. The Lausanne settlement, which was established based on President Hoover's temporary suspension of payments, has established a foundation of trust and security. If the war debt issue is reopened now, it will cause panic again. The above is the general idea of the British note to the United States, which aims to reopen the door for satisfactory discussions. The wording is extremely cautious to avoid provocative tones and presents reasons and figures to show that it does not want American taxpayers to bear an even greater sacrifice than British taxpayers. The purpose of this note is also to correct the misconception that canceling war debts would financially benefit Britain.</p>

<h3>The French Note's Eloquent Tone is Mild</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 1st Telegram: The French government won a great victory in the Chamber of Deputies today. The government's motion to postpone the debate on the war debt issue was passed by 425 votes to 166 votes. The government regarded this motion as a matter of confidence. The opposition party then proposed a motion criticizing Prime Minister Herriot's swap and public debt plan. This motion was rejected by 377 votes to 198 votes. Thus, the government won another great victory. The new war debt note to the United States, after being reviewed by the government, can be sent to Washington today. The French government now wants to wait for the British note to arrive in Washington first. The French note reiterates the request to postpone the payment of 20 million US dollars due on December 15th. It is expected that if the United States firmly refuses to postpone the payment, Herriot is determined to pay it regardless of the serious opposition in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 2nd Telegram: The new French war debt note states that with a serious crisis imminent, the French government has slightly changed its previous attitude. However, the current war debt agreement is not commensurate with the various facts of the current world economic situation, and it is necessary to conclude a new agreement. It also states that the French government did not request other concessions when requesting a postponement of the payment due in December. First, it will affect the position of the United States, and the postponement will protect the interests of both parties.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 2nd Telegram: The French government reiterated its eager and careful consideration of the postponement of the American debt payment due on December 15th and awaits President Hoover's decision with confidence. This is the general idea of the French note to the United States published today. The article did not mention what actions the French government would take if rejected but pointed out the crisis of destroying the Lausanne Agreement. The French note stated that France was very pleased to hear that President Hoover was preparing to propose an amendment to the war debt issue to Congress but felt that it was difficult to understand. One method has been deemed unsuitable for the situation, so why should it still be implemented? The Lausanne settlement was not easily obtained, and now doubts have arisen again, so the seriousness of the matter is almost unmatched. France's recognition of the Lausanne conditions has already involved many financial sacrifices, and even with a huge budget deficit, it is not concerned. The payment on December 15th will be a step that will soon harm the whole world and lead to greater disputes and troubles.</p>
<h3>The US Congress Expresses No Concessions</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 1st Telegram: The British request to extend the payment of the war debt due on December 15th did not make a significant impression in Congress tonight. Republican and Democratic leaders still insist on their previous positions and predict that any proposal to establish a debt committee will be rejected. Republican leader Watson believes that there is no opportunity to extend, cancel, reduce, amend, or avoid the December payment. The Debt Commission will also not be reactivated. Democratic leader Robbingstein recently returned here after meeting with President-elect Roosevelt. It is said that the Democrats are all opposed to extending the payment. However, when President Hoover's recommendation is received, a definite policy will be established. Senator Byrnes does not believe that any rumors of overseas financial difficulties can slightly change the established opinions of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Chairman Curry of the House Ways and Means Committee does not approve of extending the suspension of payments and said that temporarily suspending payments will only make future collection more difficult.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 1st Telegram: It is said that Poland is also preparing a second note to the United States regarding the war debt issue.</p>
<h3>The US Army Undersecretary Stresses Expanding the Air Force</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 1st Telegram: The US Army authorities' determination to oppose reducing US defense capabilities is evidenced by the annual report of Army Undersecretary Davison today, which strongly advocates completing the aircraft construction plan. Mr. Davison's report stated that the Army Department's five-year plan set in 1927 stipulated the construction of 1,800 military aircraft in five years. Now, the difference from this number is only 129 aircraft. Although those who advocate disarmament hope to abolish bombers and certain aircraft, he believes that this aircraft construction plan should be completed and requests Congress to approve the necessary funds.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Has No Intention of Purchasing Private Foreign Debt and Prepares to Implement Exchange Management</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd Telegram: According to reliable sources, the Japanese government has no intention of purchasing foreign bonds held by the Japanese, as this move cannot stabilize the Japanese gold exchange market. Officials revealed that the government is now preparing to control the exchange market when absolutely necessary.</p>
<h3>How Much Suicide is a Result of Japanese Militarism</h3>
<p>China News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd Telegram: According to a survey by the Japanese Social Affairs Bureau, 1,419 mothers and children have committed suicide due to economic panic, unemployment, and starvation, and 812 young children were forced to die with them. The abuses of aggressive militarism are lamentable.</p>

<p>The Tide of Political Virtue Comes to an End, General Schleicher is Ordered to Form a Cabinet</p>
<h3>Neurath Will Remain Foreign Minister, Most Cabinet Members Will Remain in Office, Aiming to Avoid Conflict with Congress and Not Attempt Constitutional Amendments</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 2nd Telegram: President Hindenburg asked Defense Minister Schleicher to form a cabinet, and Schleicher has agreed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 2nd Telegram: General Schleicher has been ordered to form a new cabinet. It is reported that Neurath will remain Foreign Minister, Rochsiek will be Finance Minister, and the remaining seats will be given to new members. It is not yet decided whether General Schleicher will also serve as Defense Minister. It is said that Schleicher plans to temporarily abandon attempts to amend the constitution and plans to adopt a policy of harmony with various political parties to avoid fighting against Congress. The new government's appearance in Congress next week seems to be able to win public support, but because the National Socialists and Communists are both hostile, it is feared that it will be difficult to obtain a majority. The attitude of the Social Democrats will depend on whether the new government's administrative program is acceptable. If Congress passes a vote of no confidence in the new government, President Hindenburg will likely remain in office, as he did with the Papen cabinet.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 2nd Telegram: According to unofficial news, the lineup of the German Schleicher interim cabinet is roughly as follows: Schleicher will serve as Prime Minister, concurrently as Minister of Defense and Administrative Commissioner of Prussia. Neurath will remain Foreign Minister, Braack will be Minister of the Interior, Warmuth will remain Minister of Commerce, Gürtner will remain Minister of Justice, Ruping will remain Minister of Posts and Transport, Gereke will be Minister of Unemployment, Brandeis will be Minister of Labor, and Flemings will be Minister of Agriculture. It is noted that Schleicher's formation of a cabinet with active-duty military personnel is the first time since 1890. His name has only become known to the public since the fall of the Bruning cabinet this spring. However, Schleicher is indeed a clever politician with more than ten years of achievements.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 1st Telegram: National Socialist Party leader Hitler has firmly refused to negotiate with Schleicher to form a presidential cabinet. Hitler published an article in Weimar today, stating that he had submitted a letter to President Hindenburg on November 23, proposing a way to quickly resolve the government stalemate. Whether the President accepts this proposal or not is not for the National Socialist Party to decide. Therefore, the National Socialist Party does not see any reason for such negotiations. However, it can now be regarded as certain that the Prime Minister's seat must belong to Schleicher. Even if the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party are unwilling to support him, other parties seem to have agreed to provide assistance. Schleicher is also prepared to slightly accommodate the demands of the labor unions.</p>

<p>Britain and the United States Will Do Their Utmost to Urge Germany to Return to the Disarmament Conference</p>
<h3>Davis Advocates Acknowledging Germany's Equal Demands and Hopes to Agree on a Draft Treaty and Take it Home</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 2nd Telegram: When the British, French, and German representatives meet on Monday to urge Germany to return to the Disarmament Conference, everything will depend on British Prime Minister MacDonald displaying his eloquence. Germany is not currently showing any eagerness. It is reported that US representative to the Disarmament Conference Davis advocates acknowledging Germany's equal status and establishing a disarmament committee, somewhat replacing the Disarmament Conference. British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, and US representative Davis all arrived here this morning. French Prime Minister Herriot will arrive tomorrow, while German Foreign Minister Neurath will arrive on Sunday.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 1st Telegram: Washington and London are spreading rumors that the US government has a new intention regarding the Disarmament Conference. This news is surprising, and Geneva is quite cautious about this rumor. What can be confirmed is that even if the Disarmament Conference is extended beyond the end of 1932, the US delegation will not cease its cooperation. As for concluding a convention on the progress already made in Geneva on the disarmament issue, concretizing it, it is neither a new idea nor the exclusive opinion of the United States. In the Disarmament Conference in July of this year, many prominent figures had already said it, such as Czech Foreign Minister Benes, Greek Foreign Minister Politis, and British Foreign Secretary Simon. However, at that time, the Disarmament Conference advocated adopting the method of the July 23 resolution, stating the points already achieved on the one hand and stipulating the final procedure on the other hand. Therefore, the layer of first concluding a convention was not adopted. We believe that we still remember that the opinions of Benes and others may be raised again even today, and it is also possible. Moreover, there are rumors in the League of Nations lounge that US representative Davis is eager to return home at the end of the year and wants to take the first disarmament convention home to show people. This may be one of the reasons why British Prime Minister MacDonald, French Prime Minister Herriot, British Foreign Secretary Simon, and Italian representative Aloisi will meet with US representative Davis in Geneva recently. However, it is still difficult to determine how this matter will be resolved at the moment.</p>
<h3>The Report on Banning Chemical Warfare is Ambiguous</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 1st Telegram: The Committee of Military Experts today submitted a report to the Steering Committee of the Disarmament Conference. The subject of the report is the possibility of banning chemical and bacteriological warfare. This report is extremely ambiguous, only stating that although various equipment for defending against gas attacks can be used for offensive purposes at any time, it is almost impossible to record or restrict them.</p>
<h3>The Panamanian Congress Passes a Bill to Exclude Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Panama City, 1st Telegram: Today, the Panamanian Congress passed another bill to exclude Overseas Chinese, prohibiting any further Overseas Chinese immigrants from entering the country. The stated reason is that this measure is an economic problem because in recent years, small Chinese merchants and workers have entered the country in large numbers. After several states in Mexico excluded Chinese people, more Chinese merchants went to Panama. Non-Overseas Chinese merchants are not enemies of the Chinese, and many have been forced to quit their businesses. Therefore, this ban is being implemented.</p>
<h3>A New Discovery by a Russian Professor: Using Blood from the Dead for Transfusions</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 1st Telegram: Professor Balashovsky, director of the Blood Transfusion Society, made a very valuable discovery here today, stating that "the blood of the dead can be preserved for three weeks, and during these three weeks it can be transfused into the body of a patient." The professor has gone through experiments and knows that blood only coagulates six hours after death, so it can be absorbed before six hours, preserved well, and taken at any time within three weeks to save patients. Its effect is the same as the blood of living people.</p>
<h3>The Manchurian Issue and the Representatives of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>The actions of the representatives of various countries gathered in Geneva to review the Manchurian issue are enough to sway the world's attention. Especially the small countries of Europe and the United States, in order to restrain the hegemony of big countries and safeguard their own interests, are very concerned about the big countries' resolution of the Far East issue. They see that Japan is recklessly disregarding justice and that the big countries are delaying and perfunctorily dealing with the issue. Their anti-Japanese attitude is even more intense than that of our country. Although Japan has been trying its best to win them over, we can get a glimpse of the future situation of the conference if we understand their history and claims. The following is a translated summary from various newspapers and magazines in Osaka, Japan:</p>
<p>Representatives of Small Countries: The most intelligent and strategic among the small countries is Spanish representative Neruda Regalia. He is a member of the League of Nations Information Department, the Minister of Disarmament, and has served as the ambassador to the United States and the ambassador to France after the Spanish Revolution. He is the first-class orator in the League of Nations today. At the meeting last November, he and British representative Lord Cecil launched a fierce attack on Japanese representative Yoshizawa on the "fundamental principles issue." He is attending the meeting with his national representative, Srotti. The second is Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Dr. Benes. Dr. Benes is a protégé of the current President Masaryk. In 1915, he published the declaration of independence of the two Czechoslovak peoples with Masaryk in Paris, participating in the movement with ingenious methods and exerting the unique talent of founding a nation. Later, he was listed in the first class of the country's government. Benes has actually contributed to the fact that Czechoslovakia has become a new emerging country in Central Europe. Therefore, he is also one of the great politicians in Europe. The purpose of his life ambition is to uphold the small countries of Europe. His strategy on the international stage has never exceeded this purpose. When the Disarmament Conference opened this summer, he proposed a motion to resist Simon, which was greatly admired by the representatives. Therefore, he has great influence among the small countries. Others include Polish representative Geyetsky, Panama's Kara (former Foreign Minister and Ambassador to France), Mexico's Bani, and representatives from Colombia, Salvador, and Benavidez, who are all united and stand on a common front.</p>
<p>Council President Vanleraka, his father is Spanish, his mother is Irish. Van was born in New York and is the leader of the Irish Independence Party. He is a world-renowned prodigy on the political and war stage. When he endorsed the Tobin anti-British movement in 1916, he served as the commander of the anti-British army. He was subsequently sentenced to death for treason due to the failure of the movement, which was later reduced to life imprisonment. He was released in less than a year. In May 1918, he was again detained in Linjia Prison for disturbing the peace. The following February, he suddenly escaped to the United States. However, with an indomitable spirit, he raised 6 million gold to promote Irish independence. In 1922, the British Empire recognized Irish independence. Since then, he has implemented a concrete plan to completely separate from Britain. He became the Prime Minister of Ireland this year. He shook the British political circles by rejecting the British government, refusing to pay land annuity money, and deleting the article on the oath of allegiance to the British Emperor in the Irish constitution. When he was the anti-British fighter in the Irish general election on March 9 this year, he caused a sensation throughout Europe. That is, the pro-British Kosgrave Cabinet of the past ten years was overthrown by him, and he gained the belief of 3 million people and was promoted to Prime Minister. He is 50 years old this year and is currently the President of the National University established by the Youth Independence Party. This time he is appointed as the President of the League of Nations Council. He has stated that he will uphold the League of Nations Covenant with an unwavering spirit, because he already had a sense of injustice at the time of the Manchurian Incident. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Attack the Righteous Army with Four Divisions</p>
<h3>The Righteous Army Has Retreated Into the Deep Mountains Awaiting Next Spring to Launch a Campaign; The Puppet State Issues Paper Currency to Manipulate the Finances of the Northeast</h3>
<p>A Tianjin dispatch reports that a certain gentleman recently returned from an inspection tour outside the Great Wall and has obtained very detailed information. A summary is provided below:</p>
<p>Throughout the railways outside the Great Wall, both at large and small stations, there are stationed soldiers. Japanese soldiers treat the Northeast as conquered territory and the Chinese people as enslaved subjects of a vanquished nation. Their actions are extremely tyrannical. Coupled with a group of shameless Chinese traitors, who are heartlessly rebellious, acting as accomplices, they have made it difficult for the people in various places to live in peace, and they live in constant fear of death. Wealthy families are often accused of colluding with bandits, so their family property can be confiscated. Patriotic individuals, unwilling to accept their subjugation, have united with armed comrades to resist Japan and punish traitors. These righteous armies resisting Japan and punishing traitors were very powerful in the spring and summer of this year. The total number cannot be statistically determined, but it is estimated to be over one million. However, without leadership, their strength is somewhat scattered. Moreover, due to a lack of ammunition supplies, it is difficult for them to sustain themselves. From autumn to winter, the weather becomes colder day by day. It has now reached below ten degrees Celsius, making it impossible to operate near the railway lines. The National Salvation Army in various parts of southern Liaoning has retreated into the deep mountains to preserve their strength and await an opportunity to act.</p>
<p>The Japanese method of eliminating the righteous army initially involved bombing with aircraft. Whenever villages or county towns were found to harbor the righteous army, they would be bombed until they were turned into scorched earth. Next, they prohibited civilians from stockpiling grain in order to cut off the righteous army's supplies. However, this method did not work and only caused local devastation, increasing the people's determination to resist Japan. The Japanese then changed their strategy, conducting household registration and confiscating civilian self-defense firearms. Little did they know that people regarded firearms as their lives, so the result was only increased resentment. Seeing that their plan was unsuccessful, the Japanese changed their plans again, engaging in pacification efforts. They dispatched more than ten pacification officers, including Oyatsuki Yuushin (Advisor to the Kwantung Army Headquarters and concurrently Advisor to the First Cavalry Brigade of the Jilin Garrison), Ato Koichi (Attached to the Jilin Railway Guard Command and concurrently Military Instructor), and Kihara Kunisuke (of the Japanese Kwantung State Fisheries and Aquaculture Joint Venture). Each carried large sums of money, spreading rumors everywhere, using generous bribes and promises of high official positions to lure the weaker elements of the righteous army. Some of these smaller righteous army groups, feeling that their situation was difficult, were indeed deceived. However, after the Japanese pacified them, they immediately sent personnel to inspect them, first paying wages, then confiscating weapons, and finally disbanding them, giving them free train tickets to return home. However, righteous armies with more than three to five thousand men would rather resist Japan and punish traitors until not a single piece of armor remained than surrender. The consuls of Britain, France, and the United States stationed in Changchun, Jilin, protested to the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters last month, stating that the Japanese and Manchukuo troops could not maintain law and order, and foreign nationals were constantly in danger. They requested that personnel be sent immediately to protect foreign nationals as they left the country. Japan was deeply disturbed by this protest and immediately sent personnel to express their apologies to the consuls of Britain, the United States, and France, falsely claiming that they would resolve the righteous army issue within three months, hoping that foreign nationals would not leave for the time being. However, the consuls of the various countries believed that the Japanese army was incapable of maintaining security in the three northeastern provinces, so their nationals continued to leave the country en masse. The Japanese army, feeling slighted by the various countries, took it as a disgrace and decided to have Lieutenant General Shaochuan, the general commander of the puppet state, take responsibility for resolving the righteous army issue within four weeks. They also transferred two standing army divisions from Korea and conscripted Koreans to form two more divisions, totaling approximately 70,000 men. They ordered the puppet state's finance department to allocate ten million yuan in puppet paper currency as military expenses. Mobilization has already begun. The first step focuses on the Jilin-Hunchun, Jilin-Changchun, and Jilin-Dunhua routes. The second step focuses on the Mengjiang area. The third step focuses on the armies of Su Bingwen and others in northern Manchuria.</p>
<p>The traitor Zhang HaiPeng has successively recruited bandits, now numbering 144,000, all cavalry. They are stationed in places such as Changchun, Jilin. Their military discipline is very poor, and even the Japanese soldiers are afraid of them. Zhang avoids contact with the righteous army, and many of his subordinates have tacit agreements with the righteous army. Zhang recently wants to drive out Xi Qia and replace him. The Japanese side knows that Zhang has great ambitions and fears future troubles. Therefore, during this large-scale offensive against the righteous army, they dispatched Zhang's troops to take the front lines. Japanese soldiers monitored the rear with machine guns and artillery, and also bombed with aircraft and charged with tanks, intending to make Zhang unable to advance or retreat, until he died. The righteous army, with inferior firearms and insufficient ammunition, could only retreat into the mountains to preserve their strength in the face of this large-scale oppression, and wait for the spring and summer of next year to seek further progress. However, northern Manchuria is extremely cold, currently at twenty or thirty degrees below zero. The hands and feet of Japanese soldiers operating in this climate have already become frostbitten. The Soviet army has been stationed in northern Manchuria for a long time and has adapted to the climate, not feeling the cold. Therefore, since the Soviet army began resisting Japan, the Japanese have suffered no less than 20,000 casualties, while the Soviet army has suffered few casualties. Therefore, it is impossible for the Japanese army to dream of eliminating the Soviet army this winter; it will only result in further sacrifices. As for the puppet state's paper currency policy, since the establishment of the puppet Central Bank, it has issued paper currency in denominations of one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan. The patterns are similar to those of the Bank of Communications paper currency. The issuance is not fixed, and it is not redeemable, but its credibility is being promoted vigorously. For railways, postal services, telegraphs, taxes, etc., the puppet currency is the primary currency, and other paper currencies and silver dollars are refused. For Fengtian silver dollar notes, Fengtian small silver dollar notes, and Jilin-Heilongjiang official notes, this puppet currency is used to absorb and destroy them. Fortunately, the paper currency of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is still in normal use because of the public's deep trust, but its value is lower than that of the puppet currency. In addition, the righteous army of Tang Juwu occupies 18 counties in Liaodong and issues military scrip, amounting to several million yuan. Last month, Tang's army was pressured by the Japanese army and retreated to the Mengjiang area. The puppet state still allows the use of this military scrip, but it is only used to exchange it for puppet currency to be burned. Regarding education, the puppet state has established a textbook compilation committee. Currently, schools use textbooks published by the Commercial Press and the Zhonghua Book Company before 1917. Those with anti-Japanese sentiments are stamped with a red "This lesson is invalid" stamp. Primary and secondary schools add a reading of the classics, lecturing on The Doctrine of the Mean, Mencius, The Classic of Filial Piety, The Analects, and Japanese language. In fact, most of the schools in the three eastern provinces, except for those along the railway lines, have been suspended in the counties and towns. (November 30)</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Salt Industry in Guangdong and Qiongzhou</h3>
<p>Salt production in various ports still uses old methods</p>
<p>Annual production is about several million yuan</p>
<p>A Guangzhou dispatch reports that Qiongya Island in Guangdong Province is surrounded by the sea on all four sides. In addition to the abundant but undeveloped forests and mineral resources on the island, the fishing industry is also a major source of profit. Unfortunately, fishing does not employ new methods, and there is no large-scale company to operate it, so the fishing industry is not developed. Moreover, fishing rights have recently fallen into the hands of foreigners. Only the local salt industry can maintain its former profits because of its proximity to the sea, accounting for a large proportion of local products. However, salt producers have not been able to use scientific methods to improve production, which is regrettable. The Construction Department recently sent an investigation team to conduct on-site investigations to develop industries in Qiongya. Details of the current situation of the Qiongya salt industry are as follows: (1) Sanya Port Salt Industry: The Sanya salt fields cover a total of 2,441 acres, with a construction cost of 500 to 800 yuan per acre. The Sanya salt production business was founded in the Dingchou year of the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty (58 years ago). High-quality salt fields produce 300 dan (100 jin per dan) of salt per acre per year, medium-quality salt fields produce 250 to 280 dan, and low-quality salt fields produce 180 to 250 dan. Sanya Port, combined with Yulin Port, can produce approximately 4 million packages of salt per year, worth approximately 2 million yuan. There are 69 salt production stores. (2) Lingao Xinying Port Salt Industry: The salt fields are all made of stone, square or rectangular, and are used exclusively for sun-drying salt. These salt fields are mostly built by private individuals and are not large in scale. The salt produced is fine-grained and of good quality, but production is low. Salt is the main product of Lingao County, with an annual output of approximately 70,000 dan, worth 280,000 yuan. The Wanglong salt field is operated by locals, and the salt produced is transported to Haikou for sale. (3) There are many salt fields in Beili Port, with an annual output of approximately 200,000 dan. Large salt fields can produce more than 10,000 dan of salt per year, medium-sized ones can produce 6,000 to 7,000 dan, and small ones can produce more than 6,000 dan. However, the salt produced is coarse-grained and slightly bitter. The production method is still the same as the natural sun-drying method of the past, with no improvements. The salt fields are divided into two types: one is a dry salt field, used to evaporate water so that the brine crystallizes into salt; the other is a brine storage pond, where brine is stored in the pond, and then waterwheels are used to introduce the water into the dry salt fields for the water to evaporate and become salt. (4) Xinying Port: The annual salt production is also quite large. Building a 9-square-zhang salt field in this area costs approximately 100 yuan. A 300-square-zhang salt field requires seven to ten salt workers. Salt workers earn approximately seven yuan per month. A 200-square-zhang salt field can produce approximately 2,000 dan of salt per year. (November 28)</p>
<h3>Niu Lan Is on Hunger Strike Again Because His Request to Be Transferred to a Suzhou Prison Has Been Ignored</h3>
<p>The Ta Mei Evening News reports that Niu Lan has petitioned the judicial authorities to allow him and his wife to be transferred from the Jiangsu First Prison in Nanjing to a prison in Suzhou so that their four-year-old child can visit them more conveniently from Shanghai. However, the authorities ignored his request, so he has resumed his hunger strike, which is now in its seventh day. Niu Lan's wife has not yet gone on hunger strike, but she plans to join him if Niu Lan's request is not approved within a few days.</p>
<h3>Joint Defense and Pacification in Various Districts of Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Guangzhou City Military and Police Jointly Conduct Winter Defense</p>
<p>Nine Joint Defense Zones Recently Established in Eastern Guangdong</p>
<p>A Guangzhou dispatch reports that the winter defense season has arrived. The defense forces in various parts of Guangdong Province are successively carrying out winter defense. In the urban area of Guangzhou, the military police and the armed security team of the Provincial Public Security Bureau jointly protect the defense affairs inside and outside the city. In addition to sending detachments to garrison in the suburbs, the security team has also organized patrol teams to shuttle back and forth day and night. The military police have also recently formed a bicycle patrol team to carry out patrol duties, inspecting the travel documents of the public and the gun licenses at night to guard against criminals. Military and political organs have also implemented ordinary martial law, so the security situation is still relatively peaceful. In addition, joint defense has been established successively in the east, west, north. In northern Guangdong, a joint military police patrol office has been established in Nanxiong and Shaozhou to ban prostitution at night to prevent criminals from mixing in. In western Guangdong, the three counties of Gaoyao, Gaoming, and Heshan have formed a joint defense team to actively carry out rural cleaning. Zhaoqing and Yangjiang, Luoding counties organized ZhaoYangLuo Six Prefectures Joint Defence Meeting, headed by defense commander Liu Qishi recently dispatch teams to eradicate local bandits near Emerging area. As for Qiongya in southern Guangdong, which is located on the frontier, the stationed army Chen brigade is currently engaged in suppression of Wang Wenyu band of communist bandits. However, the area is vast, and there is deep concern that there will be no responsible authority to preside over the suppression of bandits if the pacification zone is abolished in the future. Qiongya may be changed to a military administration area, with the current defense commander serving as the director of the area, in order to preside over the suppression of bandits and pacification. As for eastern Guangdong, after the Third Army Commander Li Yangjing planned the bandit suppression measures, he recently divided the eastern districts into nine joint defense zones. Each zone established a joint defense committee, with the county magistrates of each zone serving as members and the commanders of the garrisoned troops in each zone serving as chairmen. They have been established in order. The nine joint defense zones are: (1) the Hailufeng, Zijin, Huiyang District, with Zhang Da, the Director of Pacification of ten counties in Huizhou, concurrently serving as the chairman of the Joint Defense Committee; (2) the Huizhou, Boluo, Zijin District, with Li Zhenliang as the chairman of the Joint Defense Committee; (3) the Dongguan, Zengcheng, Baoan District, with Zhang Wei as the chairman of the Joint Defense Committee; (4) the Chaozhou, Meizhou, Puning, Hailai District, with Zhang Ruigui as the chairman; (5) the Wuhua, Fengshun District, with Wu Junsheng as the chairman; (6) the Dapu, Raoping, Chaozhou, Meizhou District, with Huang Yanzhen as the chairman; (7) the Jiaoling, Pingyuan District, with Huang Renhuan as the chairman; (8) the Xingning, Longchuan District, with Huang Zhiwen as the chairman; (9) the Heyuan, Lianping, Heping District, with Ouyang Xin as the chairman.

<h3>Liang Brigade of Liu Zhennian's Troops Arrives in Wenzhou</h3>
<p>A Wenzhou dispatch reports that Liu Zhennian's troops of the 21st Division of the Army, having received orders to relocate from Shandong to eastern Zhejiang, Liang Lizhu's brigade of Liu's troops, traveling on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Feng, Tong Hua, and Tai Shun, arrived in Wenzhou at approximately 6:00 AM on the 27th. Two ships docked at the Yili Wharf, and one ship docked at the China Merchants Wharf. At approximately 1:00 PM, the Xing Shi also arrived. When the ship arrived at the port, He Lingxiao, the commander of the 4th Regiment of the Wenzhou Security Team, representing the Zhejiang Provincial Government, led a company of soldiers, and Zhang Weichen, the magistrate of Yongjia County, etc., were all at the port to welcome them. The troops that arrived on that day were the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 3rd Regiments, led by Brigade Commander Liang Lizhu. Each regiment has a machine gun company and a mortar company. The brigade totals approximately 7,000 men, with sufficient supplies and equipment, including more than ten mortars and more than one hundred mules and horses. The locations for lodging had been previously determined by the Public Security Bureau, which ordered the various branch offices to find many temples. At approximately 2:00 PM, they disembarked separately. The remaining soldiers of the 4th Regiment will arrive in Wenzhou on the Sheng An on the 28th, totaling approximately 1,000 men. After disembarking, they were led by the Public Security Bureau patrol leaders to various temples inside and outside the city to be stationed. Brigade Commander Liang Lizhu, seeing that his troops had arrived one after another, plans to depart for Chuzhou on the 30th in order to advance towards northern Fujian and suppress the communist bandits on the border of Fujian and Zhejiang. Previously, Yongjia County Magistrate Zhang Ganchen had ordered the Public Security Bureau to impound hundreds of small boats and telegraphed the Qing Tian County Magistrate to impound more than one hundred boats and to send them to Yongjia by a specified date for transporting troops.

<h3>The Tragic Life of the Border People in Yunnan</h3>
<p>A special dispatch from Kunming reports that the border area of Yunnan can be divided into five districts based on administrative divisions and nine districts based on chieftain territories. It borders British Burma and forms a continuous plain with completely identical climate and soil. Since the British have been operating Burma, the border people have relied on the British for everything except livestock and grain. The British used their financial power to monopolize everything concerning the border people. British goods were sold easily, silver coins were manipulated, and labor was exploited. The essence and marrow of the border people flowed westward.</p>
<p>Chieftain heads exploit heavily. What causes the border people to directly feel the annoyance and high pressure of the suffering are none other than the Chieftain. The Chieftain system was established 500 years ago in Ming dynasty under the reigns of those generals such as Fu Youde, Mu Ying, Lan Yu, and Wang Ji who had made great achievements in pacifying the border regions. Those generals where awarded land to rule, enjoyed special privileges, hereditary tenure, with the people hereditary bound to their land. The Chieftains never stop exploitation towards the border residents, with endless exactions and desires. Farming and taxation are commonplace, but the Chief's family, the expenses for any large or small affair, are to be borne by the people. The following fourteen items are what is known, (1) rearing and raising fees when the Chief's offspring are born. (2) marriage fees when the Chief's offspring marry. (3) congratulatory fees upon the Chief's eldest son's succession to office. (4) the cost of repairing the Chief's office and constructing the Chief's residence (5) fees for congratulations during anniversaries and birthdays (6) Medical treatment and burial expenses when the Chief and his wife are sick or die (7) ploughing and harrowing fees when the day for the Establishment of Summer arrives (8) Holiday Fees such as the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival of the lunar calendar, each household is allotted rice, sugar and snacks (9) Frost fees when frost arrives, the Chief prepares banquets. (10) New Year fees in New Years, each household provides meat or its equivalent (11) Fuel Fees, Border regions lack firewood, people dry cattle dung for fuel, but the Chiefs burn fuel provided by the people coming from hundreds of miles away with no compensation (12) Investigation Fees, when the Han officials and the English converge to delimit boundaries, each household are taxed heavily. (13) Carnival Fees, when the Han have festivals, the money used on drinking and plays are extracted from the people, the Chief packages betting and levies duties. (14) Security Fees used to ensure road safety, taxed from merchants. From the summarized items, it is hard to inspect the exact number, but according to merchants that reside there for a while, the fees is at least seven or eight 'kangs' per household every year (each kang being ten robis). For each one dollar a Cheif needs, all levels of leaders will double it, heavy layers of exploitation, the burden is great and the suffering is unspeakable.</p>
<p>Han Officials form a supreme chieftain After the founding of the Republic of China, Li Genyuan began to request the establishment of Han officials when he toured the border regions. Namely today's Five Administrative Districts and the Four Administration Districts, which has far-reaching significance for protecting border areas and consolidating national defense, however, the personnel appointed in the past, most of their only goal is to become officials and get rich. In the places that are like «the sky is high and the emperor is far away», they are able to do as they please, Chieftains need to be subordinates that supplies whatever is requested, so the burden falls on the people, so the border people bear the oppression of the additional "supreme chieftain".</p>

<h3>The Budget of the Puppet State – Harbin Correspondence</h3>
<p>The so-called "Manchukuo" – everyone knows it is a puppet show stage, even perhaps less than a puppet; purely a tool of Japanese militarists, with no other function. Since its establishment in March of this year, on the surface the Japanese side thinks this is the best trick they have played, and it can indeed win the praise of their own people, because it is expanding territory for Japan. But on the other hand, the Japanese military believes that seizing the Northeast can cover up Japan's current economic panic, anesthetizing the general Japanese population. Secondly, it can expand the power of the military, overwhelming the so-called constitutional political parties’ trend of democracy. Thirdly, it can stabilize the strength of the military and maintain the dying breath of militarism.</p>
<p>The framework of the puppet state has been erected, with all sorts of "Chiefs" and "Vice-Chiefs" dressed up and taking the stage under the command of Japanese officers and ruffians. All kinds of systems, regulations, and colorful institutions have also been set up. However, the so-called "national consciousness" self-initiated movement is just an empty shell. The actual power was previously in the hands of Komai Tokuzo, the so-called Director of the General Affairs Agency, and now there are new changes. The ruffians who incited unrest in the Northeast, such as Komai Tokuzo and Okawa Meiko, can no longer live in Manchuria. The military naturally wants to drive them away, and the Japanese officials are also following the military. Therefore, this group of meritorious dogs have no choice but to leave, letting the military rule with full authority.</p>
<p>Under the command of the Japanese military, the "Manchukuo," according to their propaganda overseas and the records in Japanese newspapers, speaks of East Asian peace and the safety of the people, all of which are deceitful lies. Only strengthening Japan's national defense is close to the truth; even the talk of "lifelines" is just a ghost story to deceive the general Japanese population. Now, in the three northeastern provinces, the Chinese people have certainly tasted bitterness and suffered all kinds of grievances, daring not to say half a word about the current situation. Towards the Japanese army, Japanese officials, and Japanese people, they are only docile, perhaps to avoid disaster. However, the Japanese merchants, who could originally live and work in peace, are now surrounded by thorns, and even 100,000 soldiers cannot protect the minimum order of tranquility.</p>
<p>However, since its sign of so-called independent (puppet) country has been hung up, the formality is necessary, so its budget has to be made. Now I will transcribe below the budget plan established by Manchuria (puppet) and approved by the Japanese military (1932 to 1933), with approximate figures for revenue and expenditure (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Total Temporary Expenditure 8,825,967</p>
<p>Total Expenditure 113,308,000</p>
<p>There are two things about the above revenue and expenditure budget that should draw our attention. First, opium revenue is openly listed in the budget, amounting to 5 million yuan, which proves that in addition to using military force to suppress, Japan is also using opium to anesthetize. Second, the policy of using loans is adopted, and loans are openly listed in the budget. Therefore, we think that Japan's budget is nearly 900 million yen, plus its special expenses, all of which are filled by public debt, and the puppet state is truly "following suit," listing loans in the budget. We, the oppressed, in addition to groaning and resenting, most people have no way out, but a few people with courage are rising up and pursuing, determined not to let Japanese imperialists annex the Northeast. They are risking their own blood to resist foreign aggression and regain national freedom. (January 22, Republic of China Year 21, in Harbin)</p>

<p>Heavy Interest Exploitation, Han Chinese Speculation – Border Residents Trapped in Poverty, Even Drinking Poison to Quench Thirst and Cutting Flesh to Heal Sores, They Are Willing to Do Anything. Han Chinese Seize the Opportunity to Engage in High-Interest Lending to Border Residents. The Known Instances Include: (1) Opium Interest – Every Year After the Frost’s Descent, Han Chinese Enter Barbarian Lands to Sell Coarse Cloth, Needles, and Thread. Poor People Borrow from Them, Borrowing One Ruble, and by the Time the New Opium Enters the Market the Following Spring, in Addition to Repaying the Principal, They Must Add One to Two Ounces of Foreign Opium, Called Opium Interest. There Are Also Those Who Only Pay Interest, Leaving the Principal to Be Paid When the New Opium Enters the Market the Following Year, in Which Case the Opium Interest Is Doubled. If Both Principal and Interest Are Owed, Then the Opium Interest Is Converted to Market Price and Added to the Principal. After Two or Three Years, If the Opium Market Price Rises, There Are Instances Where the Total Owed Is Five to Six Times or Even Seven to Eight Times the Original Principal. (2) Selling Cloth – The Clothing Materials Used by Border Residents Are Generally Supplied by the Three Counties of Tengyue, Baoshan, and Longling. Therefore, in Border Trade, Coarse Cloth Is the Main Commodity, with Needles and Thread Attached. Most Poor People Purchase Cloth on Credit from Han Chinese Each Winter, with the Price Increased by One or Two Tenths, or Even Three or Four Tenths, According to the Market. When the Time Comes and They Have No Money, They Change the Name to "Borrowed," Promising Interest, at a Minimum of Five Percent, or Converting It to New Opium, with Each Bolt of Cloth Exchanged for Five to Six Ounces or Seven to Eight Ounces of Opium. If Measured by the Fair Market Price, The Cloth Price is Invariably Doubled, and the Opium Price Is Only Half. (3) Street Interest – Han Chinese Live in Border Areas and Are Very Familiar with the Border Residents. They Lend Their Savings to Border Residents, One Ruble, with Interest of Ten "Baisa" per Street. With Six Streets per Month, It Totals Sixty "Baisa." Accumulated Over a Year, It Reaches Seven Hundred and Twenty "Baisa." Given that Sixty-Four "Baisa" Can Be Exchanged for One Ruble, This Greatly Exceeds Eleven Times the Principal. Therefore, Han Chinese Who Make a Living by Lending Street Interest in This Area Only Need One Ruble to Support the Average Living of Three to Several Family Members.</p>
<p>Coolie Life, No Different from Cattle and Horses – Border Residents Suffer All Kinds of Aggression from Imperialists Externally, and All Kinds of Oppression from Indigenous Chiefs and Various Headmen Internally. Han Officials Are Only Interested in Profit, and Han Chinese Take the Opportunity to Exploit Them. Buddhist Monks (Including Both Monks and Laypeople) Also Demand Endlessly. The Hardship of the Lives of Border Residents Under These Five Layers of High Pressure Is Self-Evident. Driven by the Pressures of Life, Women Sell Mountain Delicacies, Wild Vegetables, and Fruits, or Weave Cotton and Bamboo Handicrafts. As Soon as Infants Can Leave Their Mothers, They Go to the Wilderness to Tend Pigs and Sheep. Every Year After Autumn, Men Go to Mu-Bang and Burma to Work as Coolies. Those with Some Savings Carry a Load of Sand Pots on a Shoulder Pole, or Carry an Ax and Long Saw, Engaging in the Logging and Sawing of Boards. Those Without Funds Carry the Simplest Luggage, in Groups of Hundreds, Shoulder to Shoulder, Heel to Toe, Called "Poorly Wandering to Barbarian Lands." Once They Enter the Border, They Are Loaded in Carts with Pigs, Horses, Cattle, and Sheep, Driven to Banghai Lao Silver Mine. The Foreman and Stationmaster Hold Whips, Looking Pleased, Treating Them Like Cattle and Horses. At the Slightest Dissatisfaction, They Are Whipped. After Working, Unable to Afford to Return Home, They Risk Going to the Jade and Gem Mines in Mong Kong and Mong Yang in Burmese Territory to Work, Called "Rushing to the Mines." It Is Found That Border Residents Working as Coolies in Barbarian Lands Receive a Monthly Wage of Seventeen Rubles, of Which the Foreman Deducts Two Tenths. Their Work Involves Carrying Minerals and Digging, etc. If the Price of Silver Drops, Wages Are Reduced or Work Is Suspended. Some Die of Starvation and Disease Due to the Interruption of Their Livelihoods. Some Are Imprisoned for Improper Conduct Due to the Pressure of Life. Some Go to Mong Kong and Mong Yang to Obtain Jade and Gems. Therefore, Those Who Return Home Account for Eight or Nine Tenths. As for Working in Jade and Gem Mines, Although the Wages of Workers in the Mines Are Higher Than in Barbarian Lands, Gambling Is Rampant. Border Residents Are Ignorant and Often Get Lost in Gambling, Often Becoming Destitute and Unable to Return Home. The Climate Is Extremely Hot, and Workers Do Not Pay Attention to Hygiene. Deaths Are Everywhere, and Many Are Disabled. Therefore, Those Who Are Fortunate Enough to Return Home Account for Only One or Two Tenths. Border Residents Taste All Kinds of Oppression and Suffering. The So-Called Eighteen Levels of Hell Are Probably Not an Overstatement.</p>
<h3>The Difficult Financial Situation in Gansu</h3>
<p>Military Spending Accounts for More Than 70% of Total Expenditure</p>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence. Gansu is located on the frontier, with blocked transportation routes, and therefore its finances are in dire straits. In the past, it received subsidies from other provinces. After the subsidies stopped, it began to maintain itself. In peacetime, the province's revenue could still make do with the current situation. Once an emergency occurred, it would be unable to make ends meet. Since the Great Earthquake of 1920, natural and man-made disasters have followed one after another, resulting in a sharp decline in the province's revenue. The current financial situation of Gansu Province and the reasons for its difficulties are described in detail below.</p>
<p>Tracing back to the Great Earthquake of 1920 as the long-term cause of the financial difficulties in Gansu Province, the disasters of 1928 and 1929 and the conflicts between Hui and Han people were the major causes of its difficulties. In recent years, there has been a military disaster or other major change every few years, resulting in unprecedented poverty. In essence, the long-term cause of Gansu's current predicament should be attributed to natural disasters, and the short-term cause should be attributed to man-made disasters. Setting aside natural disasters for the moment, the man-made disasters are entirely due to the military. The complexity of the military in Gansu Province is far beyond that of other provinces. According to current statistics, there are six divisions, two independent brigades, three guerrilla commanderies, one guard commandery, and so-called cadre school refresher battalions, etc., with at least 95,000 people. With a total population of 6.2 million in Gansu Province, an average of one soldier must be supported for every 65 people. It is estimated that each soldier's salary, supplies, clothing, and military equipment cost at least 150 yuan per year, which means that the burden on the people is an average of 2.3 yuan per person per year. In addition, the horses, excluding the entire cavalry of the First Cavalry Division of Gansu, the horses of other troops, if calculated at 30% of the number of people (the cavalry in the Gansu army are more numerous than those in the armies of the Central Plains provinces), would total more than 33,000 horses. Each horse requires 0.4 yuan per day for supplies, which is 13,200 yuan per day and 4,818,000 yuan per year. Each person must bear another 0.8 yuan. Therefore, military spending alone requires a total burden of 3.1 yuan per person. The total annual military spending for the entire province has exceeded 18 million yuan. Although those in charge have repeatedly reduced it, the various units, in addition to receiving more than 8.65 million yuan from the provincial government, have a shortfall of nearly 10 million, which is entirely taken directly from the peasants, with no room for deficit. The actual amount of grain tax paid by the peasants is only 2.2 million yuan, while the direct cost of supplying the army is four and a half times the grain tax. The reason is that the Gansu army is not only too numerous, but also purely unsystematic, undisciplined, and decentralized. A certain army stationed in a certain place completely regards its defense area as its own sphere of influence, allocating and demanding funds as it pleases. At the slightest dissatisfaction, it tramples on and forces the people to the extreme. People sell their wives and children to fill their desires. For example, this year, out of the 66 counties in the province, more than 50 counties have been affected by drought, hail, insects, frost, and various other natural disasters. The output of rice and grain was originally insufficient. In principle, the price of grain should naturally rise. However, the situation is exactly the opposite. In various counties along Longnan and Longdong, although the grain harvest is poor, the price of grain is not only not high, but is declining daily. Even at a low price, there are no buyers. The reason is that, first, bandits are rampant, and the people are exhausted from running for their lives. Even if they have some food, they cannot store it and cannot carry it with them, so they have no choice but to sell it cheaply. Second, the army forces and extorts them. The people fear their power, and even if there is not enough food, they must endure the pain of selling it to solve their immediate needs. Therefore, the price of grain is extremely low and there is still no market. However, of these two reasons, the latter is even more serious than the former. Banditry is only a temporary phenomenon, while the stationed army is a permanent disaster, leaving the people unable to seek life or death, and spending the year as if in a thicket of thorns. Because the army in Gansu is so complex, none of the province's sources of tax revenue are immune to its destruction. The army intercepts grain taxes in advance in various counties, and directly collecting fines from opium fields has also become a matter of course. It even pre-collects one-third of the taxes for 1933 and 1934. Other departments, such as tobacco, alcohol, and stamps, are all regarded as their own. At the same time, the various armies protect opium and transport goods, which is more than enough to destroy the province's finances. As a result, the provincial treasury has become increasingly empty, the people have become increasingly impoverished, and the reputation of the army has been completely ruined.</p>
<p>Gansu's financial revenue, including national and local taxes, amounts to 13,138,807 yuan per year, while the actual revenue is only 8,802,248 yuan. On the expenditure side, the annual total is 11,180,370 yuan. Military spending alone amounts to 8,652,324 yuan per year, which means that military spending accounts for 77.4% of the total expenditure, or military spending is three and a half times that of all other expenditures. If the actual revenue is compared with military spending, the total actual revenue is only equivalent to military spending.</p>
<p>As for other expenditures, administrative expenses are 892,724 yuan per year, accounting for less than 8% of the total expenditure; party expenses are 100,080 yuan per year, and judicial expenses are 110,112 yuan per year, both accounting for less than 1% of the total expenditure; educational expenses are 584,350 yuan per year, accounting for 5.2% of the total expenditure; administrative expenses for each county are 493,500 yuan per year, accounting for 4.4% of the total expenditure; financial administrative expenses are 240,000 yuan per year, accounting for slightly more than 2% of the total expenditure; and all other expenditures are only more than 99,000 yuan, accounting for less than 1% of the total expenditure. Although there are many troops in Gansu Province, there are still many bandits. According to reports from various counties, there are still more than 6,000 bandits in the province (this is the number compiled from reports from various county governments, and the actual number is probably more than five times this), scattered in various places. Large groups of bandits are not to be discussed, and counties such as Jingyuan, Jingchuan, and Weiyuan each have more than one battalion of troops stationed, but seven or eight bandits can hold machetes and run rampant without hindrance, and are not deterred by the presence of troops. This shows that the soldiers are soldiers and the bandits are bandits.</p>
<h3>Implementation Plan for Local Autonomy in Hunan</h3>
<p>Ten Designated Counties to Implement Ahead of Schedule</p>
<p>Special Emphasis on Rural Politics</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence. Because banditry in Hunan Province is gradually spreading, a start was made to promote local autonomy.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Newly Appointed Chief of Finance Arrives in Songjiang to Take Over</p>
<p>Su Zengrong, the Director of the Finance Bureau, died of illness in Hangzhou, leaving a vacancy. The Department of Finance appointed Shen Bingde, the Director of the Sales Tax Bureau of the Upper Review, to succeed him.</p>
<p>It was announced after being approved by the Provincial Council. The newly appointed Director of the Finance Bureau, Shen Bingde, arrived in Songjiang yesterday (the 1st) to go to the bureau to take over. The main section chiefs have been slightly re-assigned, and the Directors of the National Tax Collection Office, Zhai Zongcheng and Wang Zhiqin, are still retained.</p>

<h3>The High Court Punishes Corrupt Officials</h3>
<p>President Lin of the High Court recently set out to inspect the old prisons in the counties under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai-Dao area. Because the registration of prisoner food and supplies was mostly filled in carelessly, and in order to strictly implement the court's orders, at a time when food prices are falling sharply, the President should seek to satisfy the prisoners’ hunger, but the prisons are still overtly compliant and covertly resistant, seeking to satisfy their own private desires. It is extremely hateful. Therefore, yesterday (the 2nd), he specifically ordered that the prison guards of each prison be dismissed or demoted, and handed over for disciplinary action.</p>

<h3>Tax Bureau Arbitrarily Confiscates Cigarettes, Leading to Disputes</h3>
<p>Several cigarette shops in this county, including Fuxing Yongxingchang Yitaifeng and Xincheng Shuxia Xiexingsheng Xintaiheng, all sell "Little Champagne" cigarettes produced by Shanghai Dadong Tobacco Company. Sales have been fairly good. However, a few days ago, several officials from the General Taxation Bureau suddenly went to these shops, confiscated the "Little Champagne" cigarettes, and claimed they were counterfeit. Afterward, the shops sent a letter to the Tobacco Exchange Association, which immediately convened a temporary meeting. Chairman Chen Nianzhu presided over the meeting and the following resolutions were made: 1. Notify all shops to temporarily stop selling "Little Champagne" cigarettes. 2. Before the investigation by the General Taxation Bureau is resolved, all "Little Champagne" cigarettes should be returned to the management office to avoid accidental losses. 3. Appoint responsible personnel to handle negotiations. 4. Send a letter to the Chamber of Commerce to inquire about the reasons for the confiscation by the General Taxation Bureau.</p>
<h3>Grain Piles Up Awaiting Transport to Tianjin by Train</h3>
<p>In the past, grain transport on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was limited to diverting shipments from Nanjing to stations like Pingxi and Shanghai. The source was mostly rice produced in Anhui and northern Jiangsu provinces, flowing south in large quantities. The saying was, "The northwest can never be emptied, and the southeast can never be filled." Today, the situation is completely different, the opposite of before. Large quantities of grain are now being transported to Nanjing, crossing the river, and then transported by the Jinpu Railway to Jinan and Tianjin for delivery. This is because Jinan and Tianjin are currently experiencing grain shortages, and rice prices are higher than in Xidi (Wuxi), making it profitable to transport grain there. Therefore, merchants from those two ports have been continuously coming to Wuxi to purchase grain recently, which has led to a slight increase in rice prices. However, the number of locomotives on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is insufficient, and there is also a shortage of freight cars, resulting in the accumulation of grain in both the new and old freight depots at Wuxi Station. The piles are so high that they are touching the roofs, leaving no room for maneuver. Moreover, barges are still arriving from Hexia to deposit grain in the warehouses, all waiting for transport by train. Even with the new cargo transport regulations that stipulate a 30% increase in freight charges for priority shipping, it is still difficult to dispatch trains for transport at any time, causing great anxiety among grain merchants. Furthermore, Wuxi had a good rice harvest this year. As of today, the amount of rice stored in the various grain depots is about 70% of capacity, mostly stored by merchants planning to transport it to the northwest market next year in hopes of making a profit. Currently, high-quality white rice sells for 7.2 yuan per stone. Without merchant hoarding, market prices might fall. If grain can circulate freely within the country, it could still sell for 9 or 10 yuan per stone next year. However, if domestic circulation is hindered and transport to Tianjin and Jinan is inconvenient, there will be no hope for rising rice prices. Therefore, the future trend of rice in Jiangsu and Zhejiang will depend on free circulation.</p>

<h3>Water Police Seize Large Quantity of Opium</h3>
<p>At Nantong Tianshenggang, at the end of last month, the Water Police Corps seized a very large quantity of imported opium. Except for a portion marked as belonging to the "Xinjin Company," the rest was unmarked. It has been detained. This matter has attracted great attention from the local people.</p>
<h3>Dispute over Settlement of Public Education Funds</h3>
<p>The public education funds of Nantong were deposited for interest. Due to the conversion of copper coins into silver dollars, there has been a long-standing dispute with the pawnshops. Later, the pawnshops agreed to a conversion rate of 1,460 copper coins to one silver dollar and additionally donated 7,300 yuan to the charity fund as a settlement, which was reported to the province for record. Now the pawnshops have broken the agreement, and the Education Bureau has petitioned the county to recover the funds.</p>

<h3>Young Girl Suddenly Kidnapped by Bandits</h3>
<p>In Baimazhen, a town under the county's jurisdiction, a group of more than 80 bandits suddenly arrived the night before last, each carrying rifles and pistols, and two machine guns. They surrounded the home of villager Zhou Hongyou and kidnapped his 16-year-old daughter. The garrisoned troops in the town, due to the overwhelming number of bandits, did not dare to resist and allowed the bandits to shout and escape.</p>

<h3>Status of Flood Prevention Dike Construction Along the River</h3>
<p>The construction of flood prevention dikes along the river has been ongoing day and night. Currently, in addition to the successive completion of projects such as the Fenghuang Xinhe, the Jinwan dike has also been closed. Furthermore, it has been learned that the water level at Zhichun, between the Jiangdu Fan San Gou, which was previously more than seven chi, has now fallen to six chi and one cun, causing inconvenience to shipping merchants.</p>

<p>The county government recently received a petition from the farmers' association of the 13th district, stating that the 3rd County Administrative Conference of the county had previously passed a resolution regarding the construction of embankments and canals along the fields. To protect farmland and increase rural by-products, it should not be considered within the scope of official property. An announcement was also posted to inform the public. However, it has not been implemented to this day. Investigators from the Official Property Bureau still use this as a pretext for extortion and oppression of the rural farmers. They earnestly request that the aforementioned resolution be implemented to alleviate the people's hardship. It is reported that the county government has approved it and sent a letter to the Taidong Xingfu Official Property Bureau to investigate and handle the matter.</p>

<p>Northeast Merchants Shut Down Businesses and Head South</p>
<h3>Recognizing National Goods as Foreign Goods Forces Chinese to Easily Change Nationality</h3>
<p>The Result of Japanese Military and Economic Aggression</p>
<p>Chinese People, Quickly Rise Up! Swiftly Plan How to Restore Your Businesses!</p>
<p>Since the Japanese occupied our Northeast, they have used the same tactics they used to subjugate Korea, gradually seizing our finances, occupying our markets, and further abusing our people. Recently, Chinese merchants in the Northeast, unable to bear the heavy taxes and levies, have been shutting down their businesses and heading south. A reporter met a traveler from Fengtian (Mukden) to Shanghai who described in detail the suffering of the Chinese people in the Northeast and the brutal treatment of those going to the south by the Japanese. A report has been written as follows.</p>
<p>National Goods Disappear Since September 25th, when the puppet state forcibly occupied the Northeast customs, goods from our country shipped from ports such as Shanghai and Tianjin have been regarded as foreign goods and subject to taxation. Dalian was originally a free port and did not collect taxes on imported goods. Therefore, foreign goods shipped to Dalian were mostly transshipped through Shanghai, where they were taxed by the Jianghai Customs once. Now the Japanese have persuaded European and American countries to ship goods to Dalian directly without going through Shanghai, which avoids import taxes. As a result, Dalian is flooded with foreign goods, and prices are even cheaper. Chinese goods have been almost completely driven out by foreign goods. Throughout the three northeastern provinces, there are only foreign goods and Japanese goods; Chinese goods have almost disappeared.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Close Down Businesses Chinese businesses in Liaoning, Yingkou, Andong, Dalian, and Changchun were very large. Merchants dealing in silk, native cloth, and local and imported goods could be found everywhere. Since September 25th, domestically produced silk fabrics, cotton fabrics, and local goods have suddenly disappeared and cannot be transported there. The main reason is that merchants from the Northeast cannot purchase them. When domestically produced goods reach the Northeast, they are subject to heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies, causing the value of Chinese goods to rise several times, and silk fabrics have even become impossible to import. Since this month, merchants in the Northeast have been shutting down their businesses and returning south. The market for silk and cotton fabrics has been completely taken over by Japanese goods. In recent days, more than 400 merchants have arrived from Fengtian, Yingkou, Dalian, and other places in the south. Most of the passengers on the Fengtian Maru and Dalian Maru to Shanghai are these southern merchants. It is said that another thousand people will continue to return south soon.</p>
<p>The Japanese are Ferocious Everywhere in the Northeast, there are volunteer armies. The Japanese forces are only along the railway. The Japanese in the Northeast are most afraid of attacks by the volunteer army. Therefore, recently, the Japanese have been extremely strict in their searches and inquiries of Chinese people arriving at Dalian, Yingkou, and Andong by ship from the south or Tianjin. Any hesitation or slow response is immediately arrested, and there is no return. The Japanese regard every Chinese person going to the Northeast as a volunteer army. Without a solid guarantee from local shops and residents, it is difficult to enter. At the Dalian pier, many Chinese are arrested every time a ship arrives from Shanghai. Therefore, it is hoped that Chinese people will not go there unless they have urgent matters or have acquaintances. It is feared they will only lose their lives in vain.</p>
<p>Forcibly Changing Nationality Residents of the Northeast have been forced by the Japanese not to use the word "Chinese" anymore. All documents or external communications must be written in the "Manchukuo" style, or they will be fined. This time, dozens of merchants from Fengtian, including Chen Jinrong, Lin Yishi, Lin Xijiu, and Feng Yangkong, came to Shanghai. When buying boat tickets, the Japanese forced them to write "Manchukuo" and not "China." This is the first time that Chinese people have come to Shanghai in the name of "Manchukuo."</p>

<h3>Wu Chao-chu Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Talks About How North China Is a Land of Resources but Lacks Personnel</p>
<p>The Resolution of the Sino-Japanese Problem Lies in Our Own Strength</p>
<p>Will Attend the Third Plenary Session and is Currently Drafting a Proposal</p>
<p>Member of the Central Committee, Mr. Wu Chao-chu, along with his wife, traveled to Tianjin and the Northwest for more than a month and arrived in Shanghai by night train from Beijing yesterday morning. The reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Wu at his residence yesterday morning and was granted an interview. During the conversation, he said, "My trip to the north was purely for travel and had no other mission. Although Tianjin is a place I have visited before, it has been sixteen years since I last went there, and I had never been to the Northwest. Therefore, this trip to the north was to observe the recent conditions in North China. This trip lasted more than a month and took me through Ping, Tianjin, Datong, Suiyuan, Baotou, Dingxian, Luoyang, Xi'an, Kaifeng, and Xuzhou. The north is a land of resources, but it lacks talent, resulting in treasures being left underground and the rural economy bankrupt. For example, Shaanxi was originally a fertile area, but due to the lack of water conservancy facilities, it has suffered years of famine. During my visit, I saw thousands of miles of barren land and deserted villages, like entering the Mongolian desert. It is truly lamentable. The people of the north are diligent and simple, but their knowledge is not as good as that of the people of the south. The anti-Japanese sentiment in the north is also very depressed, not as tense as in the south. The League of Nations will convene a meeting to discuss the Sino-Japanese problem. However, we cannot predict how the League of Nations will ultimately resolve the Sino-Japanese problem. The League of Nations is not a supreme government. The League of Nations does not have the power to solve the Sino-Japanese problem by itself. The League of Nations relies on the member states and the great powers for its power. Currently, it is very unclear and unpredictable what the attitude of the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and Russia is towards the Sino-Japanese problem. Therefore, it is difficult to predict how the League of Nations will resolve the Sino-Japanese problem. The League of Nations' invitation to the United States and Russia to participate and express their opinions is also a way for the League of Nations to increase its own strength. If our country's internal affairs are well managed, diplomacy will naturally have a solution. The Third Plenary Session has been scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 15th. I will go to attend and am currently drafting a proposal, focusing on improving internal affairs. As I have said, with well-managed internal affairs, diplomacy will naturally have a solution. I have no knowledge of whether members of the Central Committee from Guangdong will attend the Third Plenary Session or have any proposals. Although I met Mr. Feng Huanzhang in Zhangjiakou, I do not know whether he will attend the Third Plenary Session or have any proposals. As for Mr. Feng's views on internal affairs and diplomacy, they are still the same as those reported in previous reports and telegrams of Mr. Feng's talks."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Boy Scouts Today Officially Starts the Aviation Propaganda Campaign</h3>
<p>Fifty Boy Scout Troops Participating, Divided into a Hundred Teams</p>
<p>Aviation Special Issue Publishes a Boy Scout Special Edition</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Boy Scout troop leaders held a meeting on the second floor of Moore Memorial Church to discuss the promotion of aviation and the recruitment of members for the Aviation Construction Association. More than 30 Boy Scout troop leaders attended, including Wang Gang, Leng Xueqiao, Luo Lie, Zhou Wushi, Jin Shaowen, and He Yin. The China Aviation Construction Association sent Yin Zhiling, Xu Tongye, and Zhang Fan to attend. The meeting was chaired by Leng Xueqiao, and it was decided to set up a general office at Moore Memorial Church. At the same time, the China Aviation Association at the Mainland Department Store on Nanjing Road will also station staff to provide information to all parties, organize a traffic team and a patrol team to take care of the route. The Aviation Association has prepared a large number of airplane medals, which will be specially awarded to all participating Boy Scouts. For all business and academic circles who join as members, in addition to giving receipts and souvenirs, each will be given a membership card (a metal airplane badge). It is reported that the first batch of 5,000 badges has been made, each with a number on the back, and will be distributed to each troop to be responsible for a section of the city. This morning at 9 o'clock, they will start promoting aviation at the Bund. A summary of the sections assigned to each troop is listed below (the top is Saturday, the bottom is Sunday):</p>
<p>Aftermath of the Japanese Police Arresting People Across the Border</p>
<h3>Although Kim Young-taek has been Released, the Japanese Consul Still Demands Detention, Taxpayers' Association Sends a Letter Requesting Protection</h3>
<p>On the night of the 30th, plainclothes police officers from the Japanese Consulate illegally arrested Korean Kim Young-taek Kim Cheol at No. 2 Ruyi Lane, Rue Victor Emmanuel III in the French Concession. The French police detained two Japanese policemen, causing negotiations. Although the arrested were exchanged and released the night before last, the French authorities say that this is not the first time that Japanese plainclothes police have arrested people across the border, so they are still collecting evidence for negotiations.</p>
<h3>Exchanged and Released the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>After the consulate's plainclothes police officers crossed the border and arrested Kim Cheol, two other policemen, Aioiyama and Yamazaki, continued to arrest Kim Cheol. They were detained by the police station. The next day, the French Consulate made a serious protest to the Japanese side. The Japanese side released Kim Cheol and sent him to the French police station at 6 o'clock the night before last. After Kim arrived, the police station released the two Japanese policemen at 7 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Kim Cheol was Beaten and Injured</h3>
<p>After Kim was arrested and taken to the Japanese Consulate's police department, his head, face, and fingers were beaten and injured. The reporter from the Guowen News Agency met Kim's wife yesterday. According to her, "When my husband returned, his fingers were injured by handcuffs, and both hands were swollen. There were also bruises on his head and face from the beatings. He is currently receiving treatment somewhere. As for the internal injuries, I do not know because the doctor has not yet issued a medical certificate."</p>
<h3>Naturalization Certificate Sent to France</h3>
<p>The reporter from the Guowen News Agency also went to Cai Xiaobai, the lawyer who handled Kim's naturalization as a Chinese citizen in 1929, to inquire. According to him, "Kim is indeed a Korean who has been naturalized as a Chinese citizen. He has now been released and there should be no major problem. However, the French authorities have requested to review Kim's naturalization documents from the past and sent them to the French Embassy for submission to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review and then return them. Now that Kim is indeed a Chinese citizen, the Chinese government should protect him."</p>
<h3>News from the French Consulate</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the French Consulate is still unwilling to make any official statement on this matter but stated in a private capacity that the consulate considers it unnecessary to make any further demands because the Japanese consul has expressed his apologies. The reporter asked what the French side would do if the Japanese sent someone to arrest Kim again. The person replied, "If the Japanese arrest someone, the French side can arrest them according to the law." Then, they were asked whether they were Korean. If they thought he was Korean, they would extradite him to the Japanese Consulate for investigation. Otherwise, it would depend on the instructions of the French Minister.</p>
<h3>Oral Protest from the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Since the incident occurred, the municipal government has made oral protests to both the French and Japanese authorities as Kim Cheol is Chinese. However, since he has now been released and the matter is over, it is currently under consideration whether to continue protesting to the other party to ensure future protection.</p>
<h3>Important Letter from the Taxpayers' Association</h3>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the French Consul General and the Police Department, saying, "We are writing to you to report that the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai has dispatched secret agents to illegally arrest residents of the French Concession without following legal procedures or international conventions. Your authorities have resisted according to the law, and the Japanese Consulate has apologized, which is admirable. All residents unanimously praise this. It has been found that the Japanese authorities rely on their superior military force, disregard international conventions, disregard the law, and disregard all countries, almost to the point where everyone dares not argue with them. After your authorities gave them a considerable lesson in the face of unbearable circumstances, it may make them restrain themselves a little, and the residents of the French Concession may be a little relieved. However, there is still no guarantee that the same incident will not happen again in the future. Because their attitude is changeable, it is still not enough to provide a real guarantee for the residents of the French Concession. Therefore, in addition to expressing our respect, we are writing to request that your authorities obtain a guarantee from the Japanese Consulate that the same incident will not happen again in the future to reassure the residents. This is the public's feeling. Respectfully submitted to Mr. Meili Ai, the French Consul General in Shanghai. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Consul Will Still Arrest Him</h3>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, it is reported that the Japanese Consulate is still planning to issue an arrest warrant for Kim Cheol and his nephew Kim Cheol and send it to the French Consulate, requesting them to arrest him and hand him over to the Japanese authorities. Although the date has not been announced, it must not be far away.</p>
<h3>Suma Disregards Sovereignty</h3>
<p>Suma, an intelligence officer at the Japanese Consulate, spoke with a reporter from the Shanghai Times, admitting that the Japanese police's forceful arrest of Kim Cheol was a major mistake, but said that they did not intend to infringe on the rights of the French Concession authorities and that the mistake was really due to mistaking the French Concession for the Chinese Concession. He claimed that the Chinese and Japanese authorities had previously agreed that the Japanese authorities could take action against any Japanese criminal residing in the Chinese Concession. The translator believes that Suma's words are ridiculous, and his claim that the Japanese authorities can arrest any Japanese criminal residing in the Chinese Concession at will shows that he has no regard for Chinese sovereignty.</p>
<h3>Korean Shops are in Danger</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, Korean residents in the French Concession report that Japanese plainclothes detectives have been very active among Korean residents recently. Detectives enter Korean-owned shops almost every day under the pretext of inquiring about prices. They all speak fluent Korean. There are even several shops that are constantly being secretly monitored by the Japanese. These people are obviously detectives. Therefore, many Korean patrons are afraid and dare not come forward. As for the real reason why the Japanese detectives are so active, it is still unknown. It is speculated that it is because after the Japanese army forcibly occupied Manchuria and was fiercely resisted by the volunteer army, they feared that the Korean independence movement would also take the opportunity to intensify, so they stepped up their efforts. News from Korea is rarely transmitted abroad due to strict Japanese inspections, but according to a few brief messages that have fortunately leaked out, many Koreans are currently assisting the Northeast Volunteer Army inside or outside Korea.</p>
<h3>Huang Zhanrong Has Fled into Hiding</h3>
<p>Guangdong native Huang Zhanrong's appointment with Kim seems to indicate a conspiracy to arrest the Kim father and son. Although there is no serious crime, the French police are still investigating Huang to clarify the situation and any suspicion of a premeditated conspiracy in this case to verify. But Huang has now fled into hiding, and it is rumored that Huang is now sheltered by a certain Japanese person in Hongkou and does not leave his home.</p>
<h3>The Silk and Satin Trade Associations Urgently Request the Government to Sign a Commercial Treaty Between China, France, and Vietnam</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese are in a treaty-less state, causing the silk industry to stagnate and hinder foreign sales</p>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Trade Association held a banquet on the 17th of last month to welcome the two representatives from Vietnam returning to China, Huang and Xu, and invited the Silk and Satin Trade Association to express their willingness to assist, as reported previously. Now, it is heard that the two associations have jointly submitted a petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sent a letter to Gu Shaochuan, the special envoy stationed in France, urging him to negotiate with the French government as soon as possible to sign a commercial treaty between China, France, and Vietnam. The goal is to alleviate the suffering of overseas Chinese who are in a treaty-less state and to promote the export of silk products. They have also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting their assistance, hoping to achieve diplomatic success in the shortest possible time. The petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recorded below: The petition is regarding the fact that the China-France-Vietnam commercial treaty has not been signed, which has severely impacted the export of Chinese silk to Annam. We earnestly request that you promptly negotiate with the French government to expedite the signing of a special treaty between China and Vietnam, and immediately include domestic silk products in the most-favored-nation tariff treatment, to benefit overseas Chinese and maintain international trade. Since our government established its capital and implemented revolutionary diplomacy, in the 17th year of the Republic of China, it notified the envoys of various countries stationed in China to negotiate equal treaties to facilitate commercial development and strengthen diplomatic ties between the two countries. Sino-Vietnamese trade has historically been prosperous due to historical relations. Silk and medicinal materials are the most exported goods from China to Annam, and the tax rates enjoyed are also quite favorable. Vietnam and China signed the first special commercial treaty between China and France on June 26, 1887. At that time, Vietnam only levied 200 francs for every 100 kilograms of Chinese silk imports. Later, it gradually increased from 400 francs to 600 francs. The Qing government was ignorant of diplomacy and did not know how to protect foreign trade, so the French did whatever they wanted and repeatedly increased the tax. In the first half of the 17th year of the Republic of China, it increased to 1,360 francs per 100 kilograms. Each kilogram was valued at 17.5 yuan, with a tax of 1.225 yuan, equivalent to 7%. The then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang, declared that in order to implement tariff autonomy, the Sino-French Land Trade Regulations and the Sino-French Continued Commercial Treaty, which were signed before July 7 of the 17th year of the Republic of China, were abolished on the day the Sino-French Continued Commercial Treaty expired. Negotiations began on December 23 of the 17th year of the Republic of China, but no decision has been reached for a long time. The French side believes that since the old treaty has been abolished and the new treaty has not been signed, all silk exported from China to Annam will be treated as goods from a treaty-less country. The Annam government suddenly announced a new import tariff for silk, as follows per 100 kilograms:</p>
<p>Commodity Name:		Normal Tariff		Most Favored Nation Tariff</p>
<p>White Silk:			16,000 Francs		4,000 Francs</p>
<p>Colored Silk:			10,000 Francs		2,500 Francs</p>
<p>Colored/White Smooth Silk:	11,000 Francs		2,500 Francs</p>
<p>Colored/White Shiny Smooth Silk:	14,000 Francs		3,750 Francs</p>
<p>In the past, China levied 200 francs per 100 kilograms according to the most-favored-nation tariff regulations of the old treaty, but the actual levy was 1,360 francs. Since the announcement of this tariff, paying taxes according to the normal tariff rate has increased from 7% to 50%. Chinese merchants have been greatly affected and are in great pain. Although the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang, protested to the French Ambassador to China, Mad, it has had no effect. Recently, it has been learned that Japan has signed a commercial treaty with Vietnam. On August 28th of this year, the Vietnamese government announced reciprocal tariffs for Japanese goods, with more than 100 items, of which silk is an important part. From then on, Japanese goods can be sold in large quantities, while Chinese silk cannot be sold due to high taxes. In the past, our country's silk sold well in Annam because of the protection of tariffs, and Japan was in a normal position, so Chinese silk could still compete for a short time. Now, our country has retreated to a normal position. It is feared that from now on, not a single strand of silk will be seen in Annam. In the past, our country's silk exports to Annam amounted to 30 million yuan per year under the old tariff, of which 15 million yuan were exported from the Shanghai Customs and 15 million yuan were exported from the Guangzhou Customs. This huge amount of silk is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Since the implementation of the new tariff, the domestic silk weaving industry has plummeted, factories have closed down, and workers have lost their jobs, which is very painful. Overseas Chinese in Vietnam used to rely on the silk trade for their livelihoods, but now they are suffering from the treatment of a treaty-less country, and their businesses have plummeted. The actual situation has already been reported by the recently returned representatives Huang and Xu, so there is no need to repeat it. Therefore, the signing of the Vietnamese commercial treaty is like looking forward to rain during a severe drought, both domestically and abroad. Therefore, we jointly submit this petition, hoping that you will review it and expedite the signing of a commercial treaty between China and Vietnam in the shortest possible time, and include silk in the most-favored-nation tariff treatment according to the old treaty, to care for overseas merchants and maintain international silk trade. We are extremely apprehensive and await your orders. The letters to Special Envoy Gu and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are roughly the same, and are not recorded here.</p>

<h3>Zhang Yuejun's Talk After the Public Telegram</h3>
<p>There were prior contacts with representatives from Sichuan</p>
<p>Sichuan generals have telegraphed their support</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Zhang Qun, a member of the Central Committee, yesterday and asked about the response from the generals in Sichuan after the public telegram was sent. Mr. Zhang described the circumstances before and after the telegram was issued in great detail, as follows: Before I (Mr. Zhang referred to himself as such below) issued the public telegram advocating for it, I had considerable contact with representatives from various parties in Sichuan in Beijing and Hankou. The generals Liu (Xiang), Liu (Wenhui), Deng (Xihou), Tian (Songyao), and Liu (Cunhou) all expressed their support. Yesterday's report that Wang Fangzhou was sent to Hankou by Liu Fu Cheng (Xiang) to oppose the Reorganization Committee is completely untrue, as Fu Cheng telegraphed his representatives on the 27th expressing his support. As for whether the Central Government will adopt my proposal, it is still unknown. This matter must wait until it is adopted before we can discuss how to organize it. Who will be in charge is a secondary matter. The Hankou communication reported that I sent a letter to a certain Sichuanese gentleman in Hankou, and did not indicate a desire to resign from the position of Chairman of the Reorganization Committee. In fact, I have repeatedly and clearly stated that I do not want to hold any position. After handing over my duties as Mayor of Shanghai this year, the Central Government repeatedly asked me to take up a position in Beijing, but I did not agree. This summer, when I was in Beiping, there were various speculations about me, but I ultimately declined the position of member of the Military Affairs Committee Branch. There have been many similar instances this year, all of which I have declined. How could I be interested in a position in Sichuan? There is no question of going to Sichuan. Moreover, the cook manages the kitchen, and should not think of dipping his fingers in it. The poor girl sews the thread, and does not add makeup. It would be ridiculous to say that I proposed setting up the Reorganization Committee because I intended to participate in it. It is a fact that I cannot ignore the affairs of Sichuan because of my relationship with my hometown, and that's all, he said.</p>
<h3>Reactions to the Ministry of Railways' Land Grab</h3>
<p>Declaration by the Flower and Tree Trade Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Flower and Tree Trade Association issued a statement to all sectors of society yesterday regarding the Ministry of Railways' requisition of land in Zhaojia Garden and other villages in the Pengpu District. The statement reads: According to letters from Zhao Youting, Youqi, Yuntang, and others, executive committee members of the Zhaojia Garden, Zhu Lane, and Flower and Tree Trade Association in the Pengpu District of Shanghai, the Ministry of Railways is requisitioning land to build a joint transportation station. After the plan was changed, 1,400 mu of land originally located west of Zhongshan Road and south of Jiaotong Road was given up, and 700 mu east of it to Zhaojia Garden was suddenly added, completely requisitioning all the land where villagers, households, populations, flowers, and trees are concentrated. This will cause the people of the area to be displaced, homeless, and without land to cultivate, turning them into starving people. They have no way to appeal and earnestly request that you take measures to rescue them. Our association believes that this matter concerns our industry and will hinder the prosperity of Shanghai. We convened an executive committee meeting to discuss it. Everyone agreed that the matter is serious and that we must strive to give up the entire Zhaojia Garden village to maintain the people's livelihoods. We have submitted a detailed report, hoping that all sectors of society will pay attention to it. The flower and tree industry in Shanghai is a necessity for society, contributing to the prosperity of the city and the cultural and material well-being of the country. The villages of Zhaojia Garden and Zhu Lane account for four-fifths of the city's flower and tree supply. How can they be arbitrarily destroyed and eradicated? Zhaojia Garden in the Pengpu District of northern Shanghai has interconnected fields covering more than a thousand mu. It is green all year round. Since its cultivation nearly 200 years ago, it has had millions of flowers and trees, large and small. Among them are rare flowers and exotic species that have been cultivated for four or five years, or cultivated for forty or fifty years, to achieve one-tenth of the profit. Thus, fathers pass on the business to their sons, and grandsons continue it. All the villagers, more than 500 households with thousands of people, rely on it for their livelihood and have lived in peace for hundreds of years. The flowers, fruits, and plants admired by Chinese and foreigners in Shanghai also rely heavily on the products of Zhaojia Garden. However, the Ministry of Railways, in its plan to build a joint transportation station, disregards the people's livelihood and arbitrarily requisitions the historical and valuable gardens of Zhaojia Garden, causing all the villagers to lose their skills and work, and greatly affecting the decline of our industry. If we say that we should move to another place, we should know that trees with deep roots and solid foundations are not suitable for soil and are not easy to plant, unlike rice and wheat, which can be sown anywhere. After the requisition, the land price in the vicinity will increase, which is beyond the reach of the people's ability. If we say that we should compensate for the price, we should know that it is not the work of one day or one night. Those who cultivate this have lost the basics of their livelihood. How will an eight-member family survive within ten years? Moreover, since the Qi-Lu War, there have been frequent wars. Those who survived the disaster are already scarred. If they want to move again, they will be displaced. Not to mention anything else, considering that our late Premier Sun Yat-sen's outline for nation-building considers agriculture and forestry to be the most important aspects of the people's livelihood and should be promoted and protected, so as not to go against the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's legacy. Now, the Ministry of Railways is acting perversely, which is unexpected. Our association believes that the Ministry of Railways' requisition of all the people's land in Zhaojia Garden and Zhu Lane is a great damage to the interests of the people and an obstacle to the development of our association's business. We are deeply concerned and have to state our grievances in detail so that our compatriots from all walks of life can know the truth. We respectfully ask all sectors to show sympathy, provide assistance, and ensure that the Ministry of Railways withdraws its order and finds a way to avoid it, so as to relieve the people's difficulties and maintain the people's livelihoods. Otherwise, all the villagers will vow to fight to the death, and the members of our association will not remain silent. We plead with all our hearts, and hope for your public appraisal.</p>

<h3>Closing of the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</h3>
<p>A total of more than 1.4 million in relief was distributed</p>
<p>Establishment of a Disaster Prevention Association</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Flood Relief Association has been raising funds for flood relief for many years and has now ended. The closing ceremony was held at the Renji Hall yesterday. The committee members Wang Yiting, Li Qiqing, Ha Shaofu, Zhu Xiechen, Cheng Jingsheng, Huang Hanzhi, Wu Yunzhai, and more than 30 others attended the ceremony. Wang Yiting, the chairman, reported on the relief situation over the past year and the closing situation (report from the General Affairs Group). The relief area covers 48 counties, with approximately 1.9 million people receiving relief. A total of 1,427,200 yuan was distributed. The relief funds received included 338,000 yuan allocated by the Provincial Relief Affairs Association, 35,788 yuan from the interest of the Construction Public Bonds, 82,000 yuan allocated by the Administrative Yuan Emergency Relief Commissioner, and 4,000 yuan allocated by the Relief Affairs Committee. The above belongs to the official funds, totaling 460,088 yuan. The remaining 967,157 yuan were all from the association's fundraising, donations from charitable organizations, and privately raised funds. A record of these relief funds has been printed. The existing Construction Public Bonds have a face value of 244,400 yuan. Upon the temporary proposal of Committee Member Li Qiqing, Committee Member Ha Shaofu, and Committee Member Huang Hanzhi, although the flood relief work in the province has been completed, attention should still be paid to disaster prevention work in the future. It was decided to establish the Jiangsu Disaster Prevention Association to properly plan. The Jiangsu Flood Relief Association will be reorganized, and Huang Hanzhi, Cheng Jingsheng, Li Qiqing, Zhu Xiechen, Ha Shaofu, Wu Yunzhai, Hu Bijang, Zhu Yinjiang, Wen Lanting, Weng Yinchu, Gu Jisheng, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaoliang, Xi Yunsheng, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Shi Liangcai, Wang Shuxiang, and Leng Yuqiu were appointed as committee members. Subsequently, Wu Yunzhai, Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Li Qiqing, and Cheng Jingsheng were mutually elected as standing committee members, and Wang Yiting was elected as the chairman, and Huang Hanzhi and Cheng Jingsheng were elected as the vice chairmen. The General Affairs Group proposed a plan for the storage of the Construction Public Bonds after the association is dissolved. It was decided that the Disaster Prevention Association should be responsible for the storage, and the bonds should still be stored in the salt industry bank vault.</p>
<h3>A Record of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee's Inspection of Completed Dike Projects (5)</h3>
<p>(Inspection of the Second District) The dike project in the second district, on the south bank of the Yangtze River, stretches from Heshang Port in Dangtu County to X溝 in Tongling County. On the north bank, it stretches from Wujiang in He County to Zhangjiaba in Tongcheng County. The total length of the dike is 335.3 kilometers. The total amount of earthwork completed is 3,329,357 cubic meters. The total cost is 128,066.62 yuan. The total number of disaster relief workers is 84,350. Therefore, the dike project in the second district is more extensive than that in the first district. Moreover, the 600-zhang dike project in Tongcheng County on the north bank has not yet been completed and is currently being rushed to completion with approximately 3,000 workers. According to the scheduled inspection procedure, at 8:20 AM on the 29th, a small boat will be used to inspect: (1) Sihushan to Yijishan, in Yanhu County on the south bank; (2) Wuhu to Lugang, in Wuhu County on the south bank. At 10:00 AM, the main ship and small boat will be used to inspect: (3) Huangsitan, in Wuwei County on the north bank. At 12:30 PM, return to the main ship. At 2:30 PM, a small boat will be used to inspect: (4) Daijialongtan, in Wuwei County on the north bank. At 3:30 PM, return to the main ship to inspect: (5) Bagentou, in Tonglu County on the south bank; (6) Liubai Zhang, in Tongcheng County on the north bank. However, due to time constraints, only (1) Sihushan to Yijishan, (2) Wuhu to Lugang, and (3) Huangsitan were inspected.</p>
<p>(Situation of the Xijiang Embankment) The Lihu small boat of the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission rushed from Shanghai to Wuhu on the morning of the 29th. The entire inspection team transferred to the Lihu small boat at 8:30 AM on the same day and first inspected the Xijiang embankment downstream of the south bank of Wuhu. The embankment is between Sihushan and Yijishan. The old embankment is on the riverside, and most of it has collapsed, leaving only traces. The new embankment is about a li away, with a top width of about four meters. The embankment surface is uneven, and there are several large holes. It has only been completed for several months, but it is already like this. This must be due to the hasty construction. Who knows what it will be like in a year? Xu Shiying and Wen Lanting accompanied the inspection. Although they are old, they walk very quickly and are admirable. At 10:00 AM, they returned to the small boat and sailed upstream of Wuhu to inspect the Mapu embankment project between Wuhu and Lugang. Mapu is only a few li away from Wuhu. The old embankment on the riverside is as dilapidated as the Xijiang embankment. However, the new embankment is more solid, and both sides are paved with square stone slabs, which is very suitable for automobile roads. Director Xi Dejiong of the Engineering Relief Department said that it is planned to plant willows on the side facing the river in the future, which will not only be spectacular but also protect the embankment. He hopes that it can be realized as soon as possible. At 12:00 PM, they returned to the main ship for lunch.</p>
<p>(Huangsitan Dike Project) At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, they took a small boat to Huangsitan Wuxian Dike in Wuwei County on the north bank. Gao Hengshou, the magistrate of Wuhu County, accompanied them in person and sent a platoon of soldiers to protect them. It is said that although large groups of bandits have disappeared in the area, small groups still appear from time to time, so it is necessary to be cautious. The Huangsitan Dike Project is related to the lives and property of seven counties in northern Anhui, so it is very important. The old dike is semi-circular, and the new dike has been changed to a straight line. Wuwei County is the area with the most rice and grain. Although there was a good harvest this year after last year's disaster, they are only able to make a living because the grain is cheap. The villagers lamented their poverty and complained to the delegation members, and some even knelt on the ground and begged for relief. The people's livelihood is like this, which is very sad. According to Magistrate Gao, the Huangsitan Dike Project is subject to the attack of the river water on the riverside. Every three years, the old dike must be submerged, and a new dike must be rebuilt. The farmland in the nearby area has been completely abandoned due to the intrusion of river sand. Therefore, if we want to protect the dike, we must first dredge the river, and the protection of the dike itself is secondary. The new Huangsitan dike can be maintained for up to 15 years after it is straightened. However, the local authorities must pay attention to it at all times. There is a Wuxian Temple on the old dike, which is commonly known as the Wutong Temple. There are still a small number of thatched huts on the new dike. Zhou Xiangxian, the chairman of the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission, told Gao personally to enact laws to force them to move, otherwise it would be even more difficult to do so after a long time. It is not only unsightly but also hinders traffic. Magistrate Gao agreed. The inspection ended and they returned to the ship at 4:00 PM. Because it was late, the inspection of Daijialongtan on the north bank was cancelled. According to the engineers, Daijialongtan has a lower terrain, so the dike is very high, reaching several zhang. It is conceivable that the project is great, and it is the most important in the second district's project. At 5:00 PM, the Jiangxin ship set sail from Wuhu and arrived at Datong at 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>(Procedure on the 30th) The inspection procedure on the 30th is scheduled as follows: After breakfast at 7:00 AM on the 30th, at 9:00 AM, they will land at Datong Yangyouzhan to inspect the dike project on the south bank, which belongs to Section 9 of the third district. At 10:00 AM, they will return to Jiangxin and sail to Saozhougou to inspect Section 7 of the third district. At 12:30 PM, they will return to Jiangxin for lunch and sail upstream. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, they will take a small sampan to Zongyang Town to inspect the Guangji Embankment, a famous dike project in Anhui. At 4:00 PM, they will arrive at Majia to inspect the breach and the rebuilt new dike. At 5:00 PM, they will arrive at Anqing for a tea party hosted by the Anhui Provincial Government. After the procedure was decided, some people suggested that they should first inspect the unfinished dike project at Liubai Zhang to observe the dike-building situation on the ground. Therefore, the plan was changed. At 8:00 AM on the 30th, they first took a small boat to the Liubai Zhang area in Tongcheng County on the north bank, which still belongs to the second district's project.</p>
<p>(A Glimpse of Dike Building) At 7:30 AM on the 30th, the Anhui Provincial Government sent the Anping small boat to welcome them, and Chairman Wu Zhongxin sent a letter to Chu Minyi expressing his welcome. The entire group then took the Anping boat and sailed down to the vicinity of the Huihe River on the north bank to inspect the Liubai Zhang dike project. This section has not yet been completed and is currently being rushed to completion by more than 3,000 workers. The area is a place where bandits appear, so dozens of soldiers were sent in advance to protect them. When the entire group landed, more than 20 military police in the boat also went along to prevent accidents. It is said that on the evening of the 29th, several local gentry in Datong went to the area to welcome them. Because it was late at night, the garrison saw that their behavior was suspicious and opened fire. One person was grazed by a bullet on the nose and suffered a minor injury. It is conceivable that the situation is serious, so today the members of the delegation were cautious when they landed and moved forward. Reeds grow luxuriantly along the way, as dense as forests, about a zhang high, which is a great barrier for bandits. The villagers build giant sheds with reeds as dwellings. The area is famous for producing reeds, which can be sold for 40,000 to 50,000 yuan a year. It is about four or five li from the riverside to the new dike. Lu Guan walked, and the guards in front were scattered to release sentries, and reached the new dike after twists and turns. The work of building the dike was in full swing at that time. More than 3,000 workers were working separately, pulling soil, carrying mud, and building the dike, each doing their own thing. Most of the workers were transported from northern Anhui, and very few natives were employed, as most of them had returned to their own agricultural work. According to Mr. Xi Dejiong, the flood relief dike project does not have a contracting system. Twenty-five people are placed in a shed with a foreman to supervise them. Twenty-four people go out to work, and another person specializes in food and other chores in the shed, so the order is well-organized. However, the new dike area above Hankou is a nest of bandits. No one responded to the recruitment of workers, so military labor had to be used before it could be built. It is also said that this section of the project was not within the planned project of the flood relief association. Due to the repeated invitations of local people, they had to reluctantly do their best. Now that the flood relief association has ended, the dike project has been transferred to the National Economic Council for management. They returned to the small boat at 11:00 AM and returned to the main boat for lunch at 12:00 PM. The inspection of the second district project ended at this point (Qian Hua from Anqing, November 30).</p>
<p>The National Government's Flood Relief Committee received a telegram from Jiujiang the day before yesterday, stating that the delegation had completed its inspection in Fogan Zhou, Guadong, Yijishan, Lugang, Huangsitan, Liubai Zhang, Guangji Embankment, Mahua Dike, Huikou, Duanyao, and other places. The committee members expressed their satisfaction with the achievements of the dike repair projects in various places. Director Xi Dejiong of the Engineering Relief Department is still accompanying the committee members to continue to inspect upstream, and is expected to arrive in Xun this day (1st).</p>
<h3>Preservation of Accumulated Grain and Property in Municipal and County Areas</h3>
<p>Provincial Government's Order</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai County's original accumulated grain and property division between the municipality and county, the matter has not yet been implemented. Now, the county government states that since the division of the municipality and county, the original accumulated grain and property of the county have been jointly managed by both parties. Any use of funds requires mutual consent, which has greatly hindered preparations for famine relief and the progress of essential policies. As the county government is about to relocate, it has submitted a report to the province and municipality, requesting a prompt decision on the division to clarify boundaries and facilitate implementation. However, the Municipal Bureau of Finance has convened several meetings to assess the value of immovable property and decided on a public auction for division. Subsequently, Shanghai citizens such as Yao Wen-nan submitted reports to the province and county, stating that the accumulated grain and property were donated by the people for famine relief and were related to the people's livelihood, requesting a halt to the auction. It is reported that after receiving the reports, the provincial government has already consulted the Shanghai Municipal Government for investigation and instructed the Shanghai County Government accordingly.</p>

<h3>Fourth Sheet</h3>
<h3>Abundant in Both Firearms and Money, Crimes Committed Are All Cases of Kidnapping for Ransom</h3>
<p>The Notorious Bandit Chen Zhao-qi and His Gang Have Considerable Skill</p>
<p>The Police Are Currently Investigating</p>
<p>Possessing a Machine Gun That Can Fire Fifty Rounds Continuously</p>
<p>And 1,369 Bullets</p>
<p>Also Possessing a Large Sum Savings Passbook from Sincere Company</p>
<p>Chief Detective You A-gen and Detective Zhou Gui-sen of the Old Gate Police Station apprehended eight individuals, including the notorious bandit Chen Zhao-qi (also known as Ni Si) from Shao-xing, Yuan Guang-yao, Yuan Dian-lai, Ma Zheng-cai, Lu Zeng-gong, and women Chen Hu-shi, Yuan Wang-shi, Chen San-feng, and Jin Wang-shi, one after another in places such as East Yu-heng Road on the previous day. They confiscated one submachine gun, which can fire fifty rounds continuously, 1,369 bullets, cash amounting to 1,342.50 yuan, a savings book from Sincere Company with approximately six to seven thousand yuan, five gold rings, one gold watch, one gold bracelet, and one gold lock pendant. All items were taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One, where Criminal Judge Qian Hong-ye presided over the interrogation. The police lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, stated that the cases committed by the defendants were all major cases of kidnapping for ransom, but the police were currently conducting investigations to apprehend accomplices, and the details of the crimes had not yet been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, he requested permission to detain them for further investigation. Judge Qian approved the lawyer Ru's request and ordered the defendants to be returned to custody separately for another hearing in one week.</p>
<h3>Robbers are Extremely Wicked, Committing Both Adultery and Theft</h3>
<p>Only One Person Among the Twelve Was Uninvolved</p>
<p>The Victim's Cousin Was the Real Culprit</p>
<p>On the morning of the 23rd of last month, at approximately 1:00 AM, nine bandits, including the notorious bandits Xu Shu-ming from Li-yang and Zhao Wen-shi and Dong Yong-fa from Jiang-bei, led a gang armed with Russian weapons to rob Liang Xue-fu, a Dan-ning resident living in a thatched shed in Shen-jia-tan, Yang-pu, taking jewelry, clothing, and silver worth over two hundred yuan. The two bandits, Zhao and Dong, also took turns raping Liang Xue-fu's nineteen-year-old younger sister, Liang Xiao-mei, before fleeing. The case was investigated and the perpetrators were apprehended by Hua Detective Lu Gen-sheng and Yang Pei-sheng, and Detectives Li Peng-fei of the Yu-lin Road Police Station one after another, along with the woman Chen Xu-shi, the receiver of stolen goods Zhu Guo-rui, and the suspect Xu De-you. All were escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao Lin-yu presided over the hearing in Court Three. The police lawyer, Zhang Tian-yin, stated that the doctor's examination of Liang Xiao-mei revealed that she was not a virgin, so the rape aspect of the case would not be investigated. Today, they all arrived in court and presented some of the original stolen clothes, a wooden clock, and a medical certificate for inspection. The court ordered separate interrogations of each defendant and ordered those not involved in the case to leave the courtroom. According to the victim, Liang Xue-fu, Liang Xue-wen among the defendants was his cousin, living across from his house (i.e., the instigator of the crime). At 11:00 PM, the robbers broke in, approximately five or six people, threatening silence. The five members of his family were awakened from their dreams. The robbers did not allow them to get up. He saw one robber holding an iron rod and another raping his sister on her bed. His sister cried out slightly, then there was no sound. They were robbed of forty yuan in cash, one gold ring, and more than twenty pieces of clothing. Afterwards, his cousin, Liang Xue-wen, said that the robbers who committed the robbery were probably from the Pu-ai-fang neighborhood on Yang-shu-pu Road, and that he had no prior grudges against them. According to his brother, Liang Xue-fa, at the time, the robbers pressed down on his head so that he could not sit up, threatening to shoot him if he did. According to Liang Xue-fu's wife, Ms. Yin, at that time, her husband and sister were crying hysterically on the bed, then there was no sound. According to the girl, Liang Xiao-mei, nineteen years old, already betrothed to someone, one robber climbed onto her bed, pressed her down, took off her velvet shirt, jacket, and trousers, stuffed her mouth with the velvet shirt, preventing her from making any noise, and raped her. Afterwards, he took the velvet shirt and fled. A moment later, another robber came, snatched her trousers, held a small knife, and forced her to submit to rape. After finishing, he got off the bed. The court ordered the defendant Xu Shu-ming to testify. His cousin Xu Huai-zhen (i.e., the second defendant) and the defendant Wu Yun-sheng’s son accompanied him but did not enter. Wu gave him a wooden clock and asked him to leave it at his daughter Chen Xu-shi’s place. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Xu Huai-zhen and Wu Yun-sheng’s son testified that Little Jiang-bei went to rob. Zhao Wen-bao testified that he knew Xu Shu-ming and saw the girl Liang Xiao-mei sleeping in bed when he entered the victim’s home, sending her off to have intercourse. When she tried to make noise, he threatened her into silence. Afterwards, he did not rob any property. Lu Li-zhi testified that he knew the defendant Zhu Guo-rui but did not go to rob at the time because he was sick at home. Later, Little Jiang-bei asked him to sell some stolen clothes for them. Dong Yong-hong testified that Little Jiang-bei invited him to rob and that he raped Liang Xiao-mei. He did not use a knife to threaten her. Fei Shao-yu testified that Little Jiang-bei invited him to play and did not say that he was going to rob. Liang Xue-wen testified that he had previously mentioned to Wang Xue-li that his cousin Liang Xue-fu's family had money, which Little Jiang-bei overheard, and this caused the disaster. Wang Xue-li testified that he and Liang Xue-wen had previously complained about their hardships, and Lu Li-zhi was also present, but he did not go to rob. Chen Xu-shi testified that her father Xu Shu-ming gave her a wooden clock. When the police detectives arrived, they arrested her father. She hid the clock in the yellow sand, but it was still found. Zhu Guo-rui testified that he knew Lu Li-zhi and that on the 23rd of last month, he sold him three pieces of clothing for two yuan, and he did not know that they were stolen. He asked for judgment. The police lawyer Zhang stated that the police had determined that the twenty-second defendant, Xu De-you, was not involved and requested that he be released. Judge Zhao ordered the other eleven defendants to be returned to custody separately for another hearing and approved the release of Xu De-you.</p>
<h3>Bandit Commits Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment</h3>
<p>Using a Chopstick to Stab into His Head</p>
<p>Then Violently Slamming Himself Against the Wall</p>
<p>| His Death Was Indeed Tragic |</p>
<p>The kidnapping bandit Wu Hong-cheng, from Jiang-bei, twenty-seven years old, kidnapped Wu Tong-chao in his hometown on March 12th of this year, demanding a ransom of 1,500 yuan, to be negotiated in Shanghai. On September 13th, the bandit encountered Wu Shen-shi, the daughter-in-law of the hostage, on Avenue Edward VII, and she reported him to the police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Wu and take him to the Xin-zha Police Station. After being interrogated by the First Special District Court, he was ordered to be escorted in for further questioning. The morning before, he was again escorted to the court for further questioning. Judge Wu Zhen presided over the hearing in Criminal Court Two, questioning the bandit once before he was taken back to the police station to be temporarily detained by the police. The previous evening at approximately 9:00 PM, Wu Zhen-xiang, a staff member from the Jiangsu Security Department, arrived with documents to escort him. He arrived at the detention center with the deputy chief Tuile and was about to bring the prisoner out and hand him over to the visiting staff when the prisoner heard the news. He immediately took out a bamboo chopstick that he had hidden beforehand and stabbed it into his own head, violently slamming himself against the wall, causing it to penetrate several inches. He bled profusely and immediately fell to the ground. The police officers immediately sent him to the hospital for treatment, but he died due to his injuries.</p>
<h3>Last Batch of New Year's Mail to Europe Leaves Tomorrow</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Post Office, the last batch of New Year's mail to Europe will be transported by the "Empress of Russia" ship. This mail will be sealed and dispatched at the Management Bureau at 9:00 PM on Sunday, December 4th, and is expected to arrive in London around December 31st.</p>
<p>The body was transported to the autopsy center on Pei-lun Road. Yesterday morning, Zhang Yao-guang, a prosecutor from the First Special Court, and Wang Zu-yi, a forensic clerk, were commissioned to go to the center to examine the body, and the case was officially recorded. According to deputy chief Tuile, when he and the staff member arrived at the detention center, as soon as they called out Wu Hong-cheng's name, he stabbed himself with a chopstick, and they were unable to rescue him. Another prisoner, Xu Run-feng, and Xi Qing-lin, who lived in the same cell, also testified to this. Zhang then declared that the deceased, Wu Hong-cheng, a male and a criminal, had indeed died from a chopstick wound to the head. The body was handed over to Pu-shan Villa for encoffining, and the chopstick was kept on file.</p>

<h3>Mei Lanfang Comes to Shanghai, Huang Jinrong Accompanies Him to Suzhou</h3>
<p>As reported in this newspaper, after arriving in Suzhou, the famous performer Mei Lanfang, along with his wife Fu Zhi-fang and others, were accompanied by leaders of the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce to visit Tianping Mountain and other scenic spots for several days. After Mei and his group stayed in Suzhou for a while, Jiang Miao-xiang and his group came to Shanghai the night before, but Mei and others did not come with them. Yesterday morning, Huang Jinrong and Tong Lao-wen of the Tianchan Theater took the early train from Shanghai to Suzhou, deciding to return to Shanghai on the evening train with Mei and his group. It is reported that after a few days of rest, they are scheduled to perform famous plays such as "Farewell My Concubine" on the Tianchan Theater stage around the number sign.</p>
<h3>Car and Smuggling</h3>
<p>Inconsistencies in the Chauffeur's Statements</p>
<p>Lu Rong-gao's Presence in Hangzhou and Shanghai is Suspicious</p>
<p>Lu Rong-gao (also known as Lu Lao-san and Lu A-san), from Jiang-bei, operated the Jiu-jiang Automobile Company at numbers 279 Jiu-jiang Road and 902 Wei-hai-wei Road. At 6:40 PM on the 24th of last month, car number 17531 from the company was stolen in the Mo-hua Street area. The chauffeur, Li A-si, from Zhen-jiang, reported the theft to the Old Gate Police Station, requesting an investigation. The police chief issued an order to all road stations and Chinese and Western police officers to be vigilant and to detain the car immediately if found. Unexpectedly, at 8:20 PM on the same day, Indian Constable number 351, stationed at the intersection of Long-men Road and Da-gu Road, saw car number 17531 traveling west. He immediately ordered the car to stop and saw that there was a chauffeur and another man in the car. The Indian constable jumped onto the car and ordered them to drive to the Old Gate Police Station. When the car reached the entrance of the Tianchan Theater at the intersection of Yun-nan Road and Fu-zhou Road, the other man suddenly ordered the chauffeur to stop, opened the door, and fled into the Tianchan Theater. As the Indian constable had to guard the chauffeur and the car, he could not pursue him and had to let him escape. He then escorted the chauffeur to the police station, where detectives Wang Jin-shou and Bao Cui-lou questioned him. The chauffeur identified himself as Gao Chang-sheng from Zhen-jiang. When asked why he was driving the car, he said that he used to be a chauffeur but was now unemployed. On the 23rd, he met a man surnamed Ma in a gambling den in the French Concession. Ma told him that Lu Lao-san, the head of Jiu-jiang, wanted to transport a large quantity of opium and needed to find a driver. Ma asked Gao if he could take on this task and said he would be rewarded in the future. Gao agreed because he had been unemployed for a long time. On the 24th, Ma led him to the entrance of the Tianchan Theater and told him to wait outside while he went inside. Shortly after, Ma came out and told him to wait at the intersection of Min-guo Road at Xin-bei-men. Gao went as agreed, and Ma and Lu Lao-san were already there, and the car was also parked there. Lu gave him six sheets of black paper and a box of paste and said that if anyone discovered them transporting the opium, they should paste the black paper over the license plates. Then, Gao drove the car to Long-men Road to prepare to transport the opium but was arrested by the police. After obtaining this statement, the detectives went to the two car companies on Jiu-jiang Road and Wei-hai-wei Road to arrest Lu Rong-gao, but he was nowhere to be found. They only confiscated three small photographs of Lu and brought them back to the police station. Gao Chang-sheng identified the photographs as Lu Lao-san without a doubt. The detectives also detained Li A-si, believing that he might be involved as an accomplice, and sent him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. On that day, Lu suddenly went to the Old Gate Police Station with lawyer Wu *Kun. The detectives detained Lu, and Gao identified him again. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court One of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Ru Bao-yi explained the case and said that Gao and Lu were being prosecuted under Articles 6 and 12 of the Opium Suppression Act. Li A-si was not being prosecuted but would be a witness. Lu Le-gao denied this at the police station, saying that he had gone to Hangzhou on the 22nd of last month and returned to Shanghai on the 29th, but the times he gave for the train departure did not match. It should be investigated. Gao Chang-sheng suddenly said that he could not identify Lu with certainty, but the rest of his statement was largely the same as the police's statement. Lu hired lawyer Fan Gang, and Lu hired lawyer Wu Lin-kun to defend him. Judge Qian Hong-ye said that further investigation was needed and ordered that the hearing be postponed and the defendants be returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Breach of Contract Dispute Over a Chartered Ship</h3>
<p>Asia Eastern Sues Tongyu for Four Counts</p>
<p>Seeking Compensation of 76,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Asia Eastern Shipping Company chartered the newly built Ping'an steamship from Beijing Road Tongyu Shipping Company in October of last year. A lease was signed for a period of four months, with a monthly rent of 8,000 yuan. The terms within the agreement were extremely detailed and stipulated that in the event of war affecting the shipping routes, both parties could terminate the contract. After signing, Asia Eastern Company entered into a contract with Huai River salt merchants to transport salt using the ship. However, Tongyu Company initially failed to deliver the ship as agreed, then prohibited the loading and unloading of goods, and finally, before the expiration of the term, abruptly repossessed the ship. These irregular actions caused Asia Eastern significant losses. Now, its manager, Mo Zhaoyun, has retained lawyers Yang Linzhi, Zhang Jiahui, and Ye Shaoying to file a lawsuit for damages against Tongyu Company's manager, Zheng Xitang, listing four counts: (A) Article 32 of the lease stipulates that the defendant should deliver the vessel within the period from November 20th to December 10th of the 20th year to provide transportation for the plaintiff. However, after contracting with the plaintiff, the defendant entered into another charter agreement with a third party, and around December 10th, sailed the ship to Andong to transport goods to Dalian, and then to Hong Kong, earning freight of 23,475 yuan. During this time, the salt transportation contract made by the plaintiff suffered losses of 35,000 yuan due to salt accumulation and spoilage. The defendant only delivered the ship on December 24th, a delay of 14 days. In addition to the 35,000 yuan loss due to the delay in salt transportation, the actual daily loss was 400 yuan, totaling 5,600 yuan for 14 days, bringing the total loss to 40,600 yuan. (B) After the defendant delivered the ship to the plaintiff on December 24th, the plaintiff immediately paid one month's rent and ordered the ship to sail to Haizhou to transport salt. When the January 28th Incident occurred, businesses closed, banks suspended operations, and remittances were impossible, making it impossible to pay the second installment of rent. This force majeure event was not attributable to the plaintiff. Commercial practices encourage mutual understanding, and the law provides for exemption from payment. However, the defendant used this as a pretext to take matters into its own hands, prohibiting the loading and unloading of goods, causing the ship to be docked in Jiujiang and unable to operate. On February 10th of this year, the defendant demanded a postdated check for 4,000 yuan as a condition for unloading the cargo, agreeing that the check would be honored after the cargo was unloaded. However, after receiving the check, the defendant did not fulfill the unloading. Therefore, the plaintiff had to stop payment. On March 10th, the defendant again stated that it was willing to exchange the previous overdue check for a newly issued check for 5,500 yuan, promising to telegraph the ship owner to open the hatch and unload the cargo. However, after the plaintiff prepared payment, the defendant not only failed to return the old check but also continued to refuse to release the cargo, as evidenced by the defendant's telegram to the ship owner on February 25th. In total, the defendant detained the ship for 66 days, resulting in a loss of 26,400 yuan at a rate of 400 yuan per day. (C) During the term of the contract, the ship should be operated by the plaintiff. Without the plaintiff's permission, the defendant had no right to direct its operation. However, in April of this year, the defendant's Yuanda steamship ran aground in Huangzhou. Without consulting the plaintiff, the defendant arbitrarily unloaded and stored the salt from the Xinping steamship in Xunyang and withheld the plaintiff's salt warehouse receipt for 1,000 yuan. The ship was then sailed to Huangzhou for towing for several days, resulting in a business loss of over 7,000 yuan to the plaintiff. (D) The contract stipulated a term of four months from the date of delivery of the ship. Since the defendant delivered the ship on December 24th of the 20th year, the contract should have expired on April 24th of this year. However, when the ship arrived in Shanghai on April 19th, the defendant unilaterally repossessed the ship before the contract expired, causing a loss of 2,000 yuan to the plaintiff. Therefore, it should be ordered that the defendant compensate the plaintiff 76,000 yuan and bear the litigation costs. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang of the First Special District Court held a hearing. The defendant also retained lawyer Zhao Sheng to defend. Plaintiff's lawyers Yang Linzhi and others stated the intent of the lawsuit and presented evidence such as the contract. After the defendant's lawyer responded, Judge Yang adjourned the hearing for a later date.</p>

<h3>Resolution of Trademark Dispute Between Family and South China</h3>
<p>Trademark Bureau Orders Cancellation of Butterfly Brand</p>
<p>The Family Industrial Society and the South China Arts and Crafts Society previously had a dispute over the imitation of the Invincible brand and the Butterfly brand, which has not been resolved. Yesterday, it was learned that the National Trademark Bureau paid close attention to this matter. After a long period of research, the Bureau determined that the Butterfly brand had a clear suspicion of imitating the Invincible brand and has ordered the South China Arts and Crafts Society to cancel it. The reason is that although the names "Invincible" and "Butterfly" are different in characters, they sound the same, especially in Shanghai, where the pronunciation is not easy to distinguish. Furthermore, although the "Butterfly" brand uses the image of a butterfly as a pattern, it also has the pattern of a butterfly and the English word "Butterfly." The "Invincible" brand trademark has been used by the Family Industrial Society for nearly 20 years and has been registered for a patent. Therefore, in order to protect the rights and interests of the Family Industrial Society, the Trademark Bureau ordered the South China Arts and Crafts Society to cancel it voluntarily.</p>
<h3>International Propaganda Society Welcomes Overseas Chinese Leader Lin Yishun</h3>
<p>The China International Propaganda Society was founded in the aftermath of the January 28th Anti-Japanese War. Since its establishment, the society has published major works such as "The Course of the Songhu Bloody Battle" and "The War Clouds Between the United States and Japan," which have been widely supported by the public. Overseas Chinese comrades in Nanyang have also strongly supported all the society's activities. Mr. Lin Yishun is a revolutionary predecessor of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang and is happy to assist in various domestic undertakings. This time, he returned to Shanghai from the Northwest and South. He believes that international propaganda is an important strategy for saving the country today and is particularly enthusiastic in advocating and supporting it. The society held a special welcome for Mr. Lin at the Dongya Restaurant last night, and invited dignitaries from all walks of life such as Tang Hai'an and Wen Hongen to accompany him as guests. The hosts and guests had a joyful time until 11 o'clock.</p>
<h3>There is No Shortage of Raw Materials for Domestically Produced Parasols</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Umbrella Trade Association sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, saying: "Respectfully, today's local news in your newspaper carried a story about overseas Chinese who returned to the country to establish an umbrella raw material factory. The draft mentioned that our country has never produced umbrella raw materials. They are all imported and the annual leakage is huge." This statement does not match the facts. This association is a group of umbrella industry members. Umbrella factories and raw material factories all join as members. Currently, umbrella raw material factories include Huali, Renhe, Samsung Hexin, Xin Dacheng, Li Yuanxing, Xue Linji, Tang Fuxing, etc., all of which cooperate in division of labor. Their products are sufficient for umbrella factories to use. Only a very small number of high-end products come from overseas. Therefore, this special letter requests immediate correction to reveal the facts."</p>

<h3>Gan Azhen Brutally Hacked with an Ax, Spine Broken</h3>
<p>Formerly a Detective in the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>No Changes Expected Within Seven Days</p>
<p>Gan Azhen, formerly a detective in the Public Security Bureau, from Ningbo, lived in Shengan Lane, Zixia Road, Nanshi. The day before yesterday afternoon, he went out from his home and walked to Zhujia Lane, a very secluded place. Suddenly, five or six enemies approached him from behind and hacked him with a sharp ax. His spine was broken, and his head and arms were cut in seven or eight places. He fell to the ground, unconscious. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled. Later, his family members were informed and arrived at the scene, finding him lying in a pool of blood. He did not respond to their questions. They immediately took him to the Nanshi Hospital for treatment. Because his spine was injured internally, he was transferred to the Beishi Bone Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, three of his spinal bones were broken, and the internal injuries were also very serious. If there are no changes within a week, his life can be saved without any problems, but he will not be fully recovered for a while. It may take one or two months to recover and be discharged from the hospital.</p>
<h3>Hu Jinshui Finds it Difficult to Please Both Sides</h3>
<p>Wu Shanwen Sued in Criminal Court</p>
<p>Hu Jinshui, from Huizhou, lived at No. 495 Yuanfang Road, Gangkou. He was working as an account splitting runner at Xiangmao Paint Shop on Changsha Road, Xinzha Road. In April of this year, Wu Shanwen, the manager of Xiangmao and a fellow villager, resigned and opened his own Dayou Paint Shop on Dewatt Road, West China Road. Wu needed a runner and repeatedly asked Hu to resign from Xiangmao and transfer to his shop as a runner, offering a monthly salary of 20 yuan plus a 7-yuan transportation allowance. Hu, seeing that the salary was better than at Xiangmao, accepted the job as a runner in Wu's shop. Unexpectedly, Hu suddenly fell ill, and Wu ignored him. His friend sent him to Huining Hospital for treatment. When he recovered and returned to the shop, Wu suddenly terminated his employment and did not pay his salary as agreed. According to Hu, while he was in the hospital for treatment, Wu even opened his suitcase without permission and took several pieces of clothing, pawning them. Hu was in a dilemma, so he requested a judgment from the Paint Industry Association and the Bureau of Social Affairs. Unexpectedly, Wu suddenly claimed that Hu had taken a bucket of Tulip brand lead powder worth 73 taels from the Catholic Church Weichengzhi Paint and Pigment Shop in the French Concession in August of last year, and that the money had been paid by him on his behalf. He hired a lawyer to request mediation from the First Special Court, claiming creditor's rights. When the court held a mediation hearing, Hu completely denied this, saying that the Chengzhi's bill of presentation was forged by Wu. Therefore, the mediation failed. However, Hu believed that Wu had forged an account and fabricated facts to deceive the court into requesting mediation, which greatly damaged his personal reputation. Therefore, he hired lawyer Chen Jia'yin to file a criminal self-accusation against Wu Shanwen in the First Special Court. The trial was held in the Eighth Court yesterday.

<h3>Mr. Liu Tingfang's Letter, December 2, 1932</h3>
<p>Recently, I came to Shanghai for some business, and I happened to learn that your newspaper is taking advantage of its 60th anniversary celebration to re-establish its working policy with the spirit of self-improvement and to intensify its efforts. This is truly a delightful thing that is enough to make people feel refreshed. I eagerly awaited December 1st, and as soon as the morning came, I bought a copy of your newspaper. When I opened it, I saw that the layout was clearer, the "Free Talk" section had been reformed, and there were new features such as the "Circulating Library Amateur Weekly" and "Reader Advisors." A whole string of good news was presented before my eyes. A new vitality and dynamism were active on every page. I couldn't help but exclaim: "Shen Bao is not old!"</p>
<p>Because of my deep love for it, I also have high expectations. Here, I have some opinions regarding the "Reader Advisors" section, and I would like to express them.</p>
<p>According to the introduction of the "Reader Advisors": "...this newspaper will select several experts to provide answers to questions raised by the readers," but in the brief rules, it is also noted that the scope of the questions is limited to eight items such as politics and economics. What I want to offer for your newspaper's reference are these two points.</p>
<p>First, I feel that there is no need to limit the questions that are raised. Because the universe is so vast, and everything before our eyes is a question. Which question should be discussed and which question should not be discussed? Since your newspaper is willing to be a consultant to the readers, it does not seem appropriate to impose such a limitation on the readers. I believe that every question has value for discussion, from the heavens to the earth, from ancient reptiles to dust. There is nothing that cannot be discussed. Why put up an annoying fence in this lively garden?</p>
<p>Second, the introduction also says: "All problems and difficulties are not personal." This statement is absolutely correct. Precisely because the problems are not personal, I suggest that the responsibility for answering questions should not be solely borne by your few (experts). It is best to have all the readers freely offer their opinions for lively discussion (of course, this refers to some major issues). Then, your (advisors) can summarize the opinions and draw a conclusion. In this way, on the one hand, you can "draw on collective wisdom," and on the other hand, you can prevent the "Reader Advisors" from becoming like a collection of answers to three hundred difficult arithmetic problems. Moreover, there is no guarantee that these difficult problems can be completely solved.</p>
<p>That is my humble opinion. What do you gentlemen think?</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Reporter's Note: Mr. Liu is currently a professor at Peking University and Yenching University and is one of the leading scholars in our country. We believe that the two points he raised regarding this column are of great value and should be fully accepted, and we express our gratitude. In the future, readers can feel free to raise questions, but our brief rules do not need to be modified in terms of wording. As for the second point, we will fully adopt Mr. Liu's opinion. Except for some trivial issues, for other more important ones, we will not answer them first. We will only publish the original letter and submit it for public discussion. After a certain stage of discussion, we will then synthesize the opinions and draw a conclusion.</p>
<p>Here is a question for the public to start discussing:</p>

<h3>Ms. Zhang Yunqiu's Letter, December 1, 1932</h3>
<p>Here is a question that may seem unimportant but is actually very important, and perhaps you gentlemen have already felt it.</p>
<p>A couple, from falling in love to getting married, this stage is usually full of sweetness and satisfaction, with the feeling of "wishing to be mandarin ducks and not envying the immortals" or "wishing to be buried in the same coffin after death." But once the honeymoon is over, the feelings of the new couple have already dropped from "so strong that they cannot be melted" to "can be melted." After another month or two, after another year or two, they gradually feel that there is only obligation between them, and no feelings. Then, they begin to get angry with each other, then they start to use harsh words, and finally, quarrels arise from time to time. The man sighs, and the woman also frowns. Further, unfortunate things are staged. Tragedies like this are everywhere, and I am unfortunately one of the leading actors in this tragedy.</p>
<p>Sir, I want to ask you: (1) Why do countless couples fall from the boiling point of love to zero degrees? (2) What methods can be used to remedy such a tragedy? Dear Sir, I hope you can answer this difficult question for me.</p>
<p>Lively,</p>

In addition to the above-mentioned experimental zones, experimental zones for short-term compulsory education will also be set up in Yangyang, Zhongxiang, Shinan, and Anlu for universal experimentation and demonstration. The division of school districts in counties and cities will be based on the standard of autonomous regions. During implementation, it will be carried out in accordance with Article 2 of the Outline of Implementation of Short-Term Compulsory Education, which stipulates that the implementation of short-term compulsory education shall be based on townships, towns, and neighborhoods. If autonomous regions have not yet been delineated, local areas may consider the local population and the distance between children's schools to divide them into several school districts, stipulating that a short-term primary school shall be set up in areas with more than 500 households. (2) The Method of Establishing Short-Term Elementary Schools or Short-Term Elementary Schools: Each provincial experimental zone shall set up 5 to 20 short-term elementary schools, and each public and private complete elementary school above the level of the school shall add at least one short-term elementary school class. Each county experimental zone shall set up 2 to 5 short-term elementary schools, and each county and city school district shall set up several short-term elementary schools, with the number of schools based on the ability to accommodate out-of-school children aged 10 to 16. Encourage various agencies, groups, and individuals to set up short-term elementary schools or short-term elementary school classes. (3) Steps to Promote Short-Term Compulsory Education: Starting from August of this year, it will be carried out in three phases, each phase lasting one year. In the first phase, from August 1932 to July of next year, each provincial experimental zone shall set up several short-term elementary schools, each county shall establish at least two experimental zones, and each experimental zone shall set up two short-term elementary schools. Each public and private complete elementary school above the level of the school shall add one short-term elementary school class. In the second phase, from August of next year to July of the year after next, all short-term elementary schools that should be set up in each provincial experimental zone shall be fully established. In addition to adding two experimental zones in each county, each experimental zone shall set up 2 to 5 short-term elementary schools, and short-term elementary schools shall be set up in each district. During this period, more than one-half of the townships, towns, and neighborhoods under each county shall have one short-term elementary school. Secondly, each county and city shall improve the methods for private schools in each county and convert the improved private schools into substitute elementary schools and add a short-term elementary school class. In the third phase, from August 1934 to July 1935, each county shall complete five experimental zones, and each county and city township, town, and neighborhood shall, in addition to establishing one short-term elementary school, increase the number of short-term elementary schools or short-term elementary school classes if there are still older out-of-school children.

<h3>The Private School Federation of the French Concession is Actively Carrying Out a Subsidy Movement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Association Submitted a Petition to the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Education to Argue Their Case Based on Reason</p>
<p>Sudden Prohibition of Broadcasting and Speeches by the British Authorities</p>
<p>The Private School Federation of the French Concession in Shanghai is seeking subsidies from the French Municipal Council for private schools in the concession. Since the Municipal Education Bureau and the Municipal Government negotiated with the French Consul, the federation has been waiting for a solution. However, all parties are still working hard. The recent work is divided as follows:</p>
<h3>Document Submitted to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>The federation prepared a document and submitted it to the Municipal Government yesterday to argue their case based on reason. The following is an excerpt from the original text: "We believe that the French Municipal Council should allocate 20% of its total annual income to Chinese education starting in 1933, giving priority to subsidizing private primary and secondary schools that have already been established in the concession, so that they can be expanded to accommodate out-of-school Chinese children. In the past month, we have been appealing in all directions in order to realize our demands and fight for the benefits we deserve. (Omitted) Our federation's movement to request funding from the French Municipal Council was a last resort when we went to petition. Since the Municipal Education Bureau and Your Government have undertaken to negotiate with the French Municipal Council, we can wait quietly for a solution. However, we would like to ask Your Government to strive for the following: The French Municipal Council should seek balanced development for Western and Chinese education in the concession. However, according to the findings of the investigation, the annual education expenses for each Westerner are 44 taels, while the education expenses for each Chinese child are only 7 qian and 22 fen. This is so unfair that it is shocking. Therefore, we request that the French Municipal Council develop Chinese education to make the treatment of Chinese children and Western children equal as a principle. In addition to distributing it to the Municipal Education Bureau, we submit it together for your examination and approval. We respectfully ask Your Government to fight for it based on reason as soon as possible in order to realize it. We await your orders with the utmost urgency."</p>
<h3>Broadcasting Not Completed</h3>
<p>In order to awaken the public's attention, the federation originally planned to broadcast speeches in Mandarin, English, and French by the executive committee members at the Zhongxi Pharmacy on Sima Road from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM every Monday and Thursday, starting on the 5th of this month. The arrangements had already been made, and it was about to begin. Unexpectedly, the British Concession Police Department sent detectives to the Zhongxi Pharmacy the day before yesterday to inform them that speeches were prohibited. The federation was outraged when they heard this, because this action was purely to promote the educational cause in the concession, and it did not disrupt the security of the concession or violate the anti-concession prohibition. To be prohibited is extremely unreasonable. In addition to submitting a serious protest to the British Concession authorities through the Municipal Government, the federation will convene a general meeting to discuss effective measures to negotiate with the British Concession authorities.</p>

Then, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters gave a speech, stating that education must have a revolutionary spirit, and women should pay more attention to education. Afterwards, the Mayor's representative gave a speech, encouraging the school authorities, faculty, and students to embrace the spirit of striving for recovery, so that the imperialists' conspiracy to destroy our cultural institutions would not succeed. Following this, Cai Zimin, the chairman of the board of directors, reported on the difficulties and hardships of the school's initial establishment and the school's contribution to the revolution, hoping to continue this spirit in the future. Afterwards, guest Liao Maoru gave a speech, stating that the educational circles should have: (1) a spirit of moving forward, (2) a spirit of hard work, and (3) a spirit of cooperation, in order to save the declining trend in education and save the country and the nation.

<p>Starting at 8:00 AM at the Intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Cadre Road</p>
<p>Sixty-One Athletes from Six Countries Participating in Team and Individual Competitions</p>
<p>The British Team's Average Talent Makes Them China's Biggest Enemy</p>
<p>China Must Work Hard to Retain the Championship</p>
<p>The annual Shanghai International Race Walking competition will be held tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM at the old site, the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Cadre Road. The entire route will be the same as before, ending in front of the grandstand of the Racecourse, a total of seventeen miles and one hundred yards. A total of sixty-one athletes from six countries are participating this time, plus individual competitors. The number of British athletes is nearly half of the total, making them unmatched by any other country. The competition will be very intense. The details are listed below.</p>
<h3>It Will be Difficult for the Chinese Team to Retain the Championship</h3>
<p>The International Race Walking Championship has been held by the Chinese team for three years. This time, due to the loss of two veteran players, although there are new athletes to replace them, the average talent of the British team is strong, and it will be difficult for China to maintain its glory. It is predictable that Shi Jinsheng can win first place and will definitely set a new record. Zhou Yuyu will have difficulty repeating his old form. This year, the British team is China's biggest enemy and intends to regain the championship held by China. It is hoped that the Chinese athletes will work hard for it.</p>

<h3>Pacers' Notice</h3>

The first person is only allowed to join at the intersection of Jisi Feier Road and Bailinan Road (i.e., the Pentagon).

The second person must exit at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Weihaiwei Road and go around directly into the Racecourse. The number cloth of the pacer must be on the right arm. All those who serve as pacers should pay attention, and those who serve in the second section can go directly to the intersection of Luo Biejin Road, Hongqiao Road after the departure to wait.</p>

<h3>No Comparison to the Past, John Loses to Jinan</h3>
<p>| Western Youth Basketball Results Last Night |</p>
<p>Pirates Defeat Ye Shi, John Middle School Defeats Tongwen</p>
<p>| Six Matches Tonight |</p>
<p>The John University basketball team lost to Jinan University in the Western Youth Basketball Tournament last night with a score of 25 to 38. John has been the champion for many years, but this year, the veterans have declined, and the new players have not reached the ideal state, and their strength has decreased. In the other Division A match, Pirates defeated Ye Shi 63 to 24. In the Division B match, John Middle School defeated Tongwen 61 to 8. Six matches tonight.</p>
<p>John Middle School Defeats Tongwen John Middle School's victory over Tongwen College was like striking an egg with a stone. In the first half, Tongwen only scored two points, 33 to 2. In the second half, it was still like entering a no-man's land. The final result was 61 to 8.</p>
<p>Jinan Fights Hard to Break John In the first half, Jinan threw in two goals and made one free throw, with a score of 5 to 0, a powerful momentum. Then they took the lead with 7 to 1. Seeing that the situation was not good, John changed tactics and fought again. Although they gradually saw success, they still trailed by four points at 15 to 11. Hou Xuemin was transferred in and tied the score at 15 to 15. After Chen Xianglong scored one goal, John won the first half with 19 to 15, leading by four points. Starting in the second half, Jinan's attack was particularly fierce. Many fouls were committed, losing a lot of points, only leading by five or six points. When the score was 28 to 23, Chen Xianglong committed four fouls, and John's front line became even more of a mess. Jinan was unstoppable, winning the second half with 38 to 25. John only scored six points in total. Jinan's performance in the second half was compact and very watchable.</p>

<p>Pirates Defeat Ye Shi Again The Pirates team still lost to Ye Shi due to the inaccuracy of throwing and shooting, and scored very few points. However, they fought bravely against the enemy, which was commendable. In the first half, they were able to score eleven points, but as a result, they lost 24 to 63.

<h3>Hangzhou Basketball Game Causes a Great Disturbance</h3>
<p>Huilan Sports Instructor Leads Students to Assault and Humiliate Referees</p>
<p>Referee Meeting Decides on Severe Punishment, Education Department to Implement Separately</p>
<p>In the Zhejiang First District Games, the high school basketball game between Provincial High School and Private Huilan Middle School was held at the former National Games basketball court. Because it was related to winning the championship, the conference was extremely cautious, and there were as many as five timekeepers. At 9:00 AM, the referee Xu Yingchao blew the whistle to start the game.</p>
<p>Huilan Loses The strength of the two armies was stronger in high school, leading from beginning to end. However, Huilan was not willing to be outdone, so the competition was often tense. The referees enforced the law impartially and meticulously. As a result, Huilan was declared defeated by one point.</p>
<p>Unfortunate Incident After the game, the audience dispersed. Suddenly, Huilan sports instructor Xu Mumin led the students to surround the referee, claiming that the game time was not over. They then rioted and used force, and the referee was unjustly attacked. Fortunately, the staff of the conference went to stop them and were also frequently beaten.</p>
<p>Announcing a Ceasefire After the unfortunate incident occurred, the conference felt that the situation was serious, and it would be difficult for future games to proceed smoothly, so it issued an emergency order to announce a temporary suspension.</p>
<p>Referee Meeting All the referees heard the news and felt that it was extremely unfair for the referee to be humiliated on duty. Therefore, at 7:00 PM that night, an emergency meeting of all the referees was convened. The following resolutions were unanimously passed and sent to the Standing Committee of the First District Games and the Provincial Department of Education for implementation.</p>
<p>(1) Request the Regional Conference and the Provincial Department of Education to cancel Huilan Middle School's participation in all sports meets and competitions and all its representative rights for more than three years. The points and championship won by the school in this district games will also be cancelled. (2) Ask the conference and Huilan Middle School to send a letter of apology to Mr. Xu Yingchao and publish it in the newspaper. (3) Ask the conference and the Education Department to order all schools in the province not to hire Xu Mumin as a sports or other teacher, and send letters to schools and educational institutions across the country not to hire Xu Mumin as any teacher or staff member. (4) Request the Education Department to order Huilan Middle School to immediately terminate Xu Mumin's employment contract. (5) Request the Education Department to order Huilan Middle School to immediately expel the students who took the lead in the attack. (6) The conference and the Education Department will provide a satisfactory reply and implement it conscientiously. Otherwise, no referee will take responsibility. (7) Ask the conference and the Education Department to properly formulate measures to ensure the safety of referees, otherwise all referees will not take responsibility for any sports meets in the future.</p>
<p>Conference Handling After the unexpected incident occurred, Chief Referee Chen Boqing immediately convened an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee to discuss it overnight. In addition to fully accepting the resolutions of the referees, he has worked with the Education Department to implement them separately and effectively.</p>
<h3>Qingdao City Builds North China Sports Field</h3>
<p>| Expenditure of 100,000 Yuan |</p>
<p>| Expected Completion in April or May |</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: When the 16th North China Games were held in Bian this year, the North China Sports Federation also took the opportunity to hold an annual meeting. The Qingdao representatives, acting on the intention of Mayor Shen, welcomed the 17th North China Games to be held in Qingdao next year. Unexpectedly, the representatives from Shanxi Province also had the same request at that time. After deliberation by the Executive Committee, it was decided that Shanxi Province had requested it first last year, so the next North China Games should be given priority to be held in that province, but it was necessary to build a large-scale stadium as a prerequisite. The Municipal Government received a letter from the North China Sports Federation yesterday, stating that according to a letter from the Shanxi Provincial Government, the province had suffered a severe flood and was currently engaged in various relief efforts, making it difficult to prepare. They requested that it be held in Qingdao. It is reported that the Municipal Government decided to reply with a letter of welcome. Regarding the construction of the stadium, planning is currently underway. A preparatory committee will be established to be responsible for preparing everything, and the Municipal Government has decided to allocate 100,000 yuan as construction costs. The construction site has been surveyed in the eastern part of the Huiquan Racecourse and part of the First Park to create a large-scale public stadium, which is expected to be completed in April or May next year.</p>

The Change in Yin Yuan Led to Prosperous Sales and Light Sales, and the Situation Presented a Downstream Phenomenon.</p>
<p>(New Zha) Yesterday, More Than 50 Inland Arrivals on the Suzhou River. The Store Stomachs in This Street Were Relaxed. Goods From Changshu and Kunshan Fell by 2 Jiao at the Opening. Early Rice Also Followed Lowering by Nearly a Foot. Dudu Pointed Customer Groups Slightly Moved, And Also Tightly Escorted Permits. The Daily Corn Foot Was About 2,500 Dan.</p>
<h3>Starch Fiercely Raises</h3>
<p>| The Tianjin Group Slightly Flattens After Returning Before Closing |</p>
<p>After the Opening of the Starch Market Yesterday Morning, Each Month Showed a Fiercely Rising State. With the Foreign Wheat Quote, The U.S. Soared by 7 or 8 Jiao, and the Ridge Rose by 2 or 3 Jiao. Coupled with the Remaining Wind of the High Gold Market, The Hearts of Most People Were Consistently Firm. The Near and Far Opening Prices Were Invisibly Raised by 2 or 3 Fen Compared to the Previous Day's Closing. Transactions in Each Plate Were Smooth and Prosperous. The Long-Term Was Particularly Spectacular Because People's Hearts Had Already Turned to Rise. Until the Beginning of the Afternoon Opening, It Was Also Good, Then It Was Slightly Soft in the Midst of Consolidation. Because of the Return of the Tianjin Group, A Small Number of Small and Medium-Sized Factories Also Had a Small Number of Shipments (It Is Said That Tianjin Continued to Order More Than 200,000 Bags of Australian Flour at a Price of 1 Tael, 6 Qian, and 6 or 7 Fen). So, People's Hearts Were Slightly Flat. However, Dalian Did a Lot, and It Was Also Related to the Rescue. Observing the Subsequent Steps, After This Rise, It Should Temporarily Trend Towards Stabilization. The Result Was This Month Rose by 1 Fen and 7 Li and a Half Compared to the Previous Day. January Rose by 2 Fen and 2 Li and a Half. February Rose by 3 Fen and a Half. March Rose by 3 Fen. April Rose by 3 Fen and 2 Li and a Half. May Opened at 1 Tael, 7 Qian, and 7 Fen, and the Closing Price Was Also Good by 1 Fen.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Has Smooth Transactions and Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Futures Wheat Market, Each Month Unanimously Presented a Soaring Phenomenon. With the Foreign Wheat Quote, It Recovered and Rose by 2 or 3 Jiao to 7 or 8 Jiao. The Exchange Rate Stepped Downward. This Situation Inevitably Impedes the Future of Fixed Wheat. The Exchange, Which Had Been Silent for a Long Time, Finally Showed a Glimmer of Life. The Transactions in Each Plate in the Morning and Afternoon Were Smooth and Prosperous, and Market Prices Also Soared Wildly. Observing the Future, If There Is No Foreign Wheat Hedging, It Is Difficult to Loosen. The Result Was This Month Rose by 7 Fen Compared to the Previous Day. January Rose by 4 Fen. February Rose by 7 Fen. March Rose by 6 Fen. April Rose by 7 Fen.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Soars</h3>
<p>Shanghai Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report, Thursday (1st), Chicago Wheat, Due to the Poor Winter Production Report and Eastern Purchases, Soared More Than 2 Fen. Also, The Total Transaction Volume on the 30th Was 50 Million Bushels. The Market Prices on the 1st Are Listed on the Left.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market Sugar Goods Rise with the Gold Price</h3>

<h3>North-South Goods: Almond Prices Improve, Shanghai Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>Almond sales have been quite sluggish recently, with little price fluctuation. According to letters from Tianjin, prices have gradually increased. White Jade Flat almonds are priced at 52 taels, Dragon King Hat at 46 taels, Wilderness Almonds are out of stock at the origin, North Mountain Almonds at 37 taels, and Nine-Ridge Eyebrow at 35 taels. Adding all external fees, the prices are similar to those in Shanghai. However, the trading volume here is minimal, and merchants are not interested in further procurement. Yesterday's market prices were: White Jade Flat 60 taels, King Hat 53-54 taels, Wilderness Almonds 48-49 taels, North Mountain Almonds 45 taels, and Nine-Ridge Eyebrow 41-42 taels.

<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Wedding Night (2)</h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>She didn't know how many times she had said such words. At first, she felt a bit sentimental and sometimes even shed tears, but later she didn't even have a sad expression. She was already thirty-six years old, but her sallow face made her look like an old woman who was at least forty-five or forty-six. She had no family and was just doing odd jobs for people, mending clothes, combing hair to make a living. She didn't owe debts and had never lived a comfortable life. Because she was an unfortunate person, she was always forbidden to watch whenever someone had a wedding, and she was very self-aware, never going to see the bride until the next day.</p>
<p>(Sister Lian, congratulations on getting a good sister-in-law. I heard she's very beautiful, like a fairy descended from heaven.)</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Xun quickly bowed to Sister Lian to congratulate her, but Sister Lian replied with disappointment:</p>
<p>(She is very beautiful, but she is too young and doesn't understand anything. She even made a joke last night. Did you hear it?)</p>
<p>(I heard it. But it doesn't matter. Last night was the first night, and traditionally the new bride is supposed to be polite. It will be better tonight. As long as the two of them are familiar with each other, there will be no problems.)</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Xun spoke as if she had a lot of experience.</p>
<p>(Yes! You're still worrying about them. Maybe they are at this moment...)</p>
<p>The Old Lady Ru's two sentences were so powerful that they not only made them laugh until their stomachs hurt, but even the guests next door and the next door neighbor were awakened by the laughter! (2)</p>
<p>The bride, Miss Xiu, was just as everyone praised, like a fairy descended from heaven. She had all the beautiful qualities of a woman, but one thing that must be said was a shortcoming: she never dared to look people in the eye when she spoke, but just stared at the ground, and sometimes she stuttered and stammered. In short, watching her speak was uncomfortable, but perhaps some people would appreciate another kind of charm from this, so it is said that several handsome young men had suffered lovesickness for her.</p>
<p>Miss Xiu's father was a Daoist with incense offerings. He was very honest and intelligent, and had believed in the Buddha since he was a child, so chanting for the Buddha and performing rituals became his lifelong occupation. He had two daughters and three sons. Miss Xiu was the eldest and helped her mother with housework since she was little. The clothes and diapers of her younger siblings were almost entirely taken care of by her. Her temper was very good, and she always smiled at people and never cursed at people. However, she had a strange and unusual belief: that was not to marry!</p>
<p>This is how it happened: when she was fifteen years old, she suddenly started menstruating in the summer. Her mother was very happy because this was a sign of complete development, and she no longer worried that she was infertile (Note 2). However, Miss Xiu was so troubled by this that she almost wanted to commit suicide, because she felt that this thing was not only dirty but also too troublesome. The weather was hot, and she could only wear one pair of pants. If she was not careful, bright red blood would run out regardless of everything, and people would laugh their heads off if they saw it. What if Miss Xiu's mother found out? That would be even worse! Therefore, she felt that menstruation was more terrible than floods and wild beasts. She didn't know that this was a woman's physiological change. When menstruation came, she would feel dizzy, have blurred vision, have weak limbs, and those with problems would have stomachaches, backaches, poor appetite, irritable temper, and all kinds of morbidities would come out together. She only felt inexplicably annoyed, and sometimes even said to herself: (I wish I could die sooner, women are really not human beings!)</p>
<h3>Crying</h3>
<p>Yesterday came a (laugh), today, let's try another (cry). Although (cry) is somewhat unlucky, and seems to contradict the (total mobilization of laughter) advocated yesterday. But in such a poignant and yet inspiring era, if we are allowed to laugh, then no one can forbid us to cry, as long as we ourselves are not afraid of bad luck.</p>
<p>Speaking of crying, just like laughing, it can be divided into many kinds: The wife of Hua Zhou Qi Liang was good at crying for her husband, which was the sorrowful cry of a widow; Jia Baoyu accidentally said a word or two that offended his sister, and Lin Daiyu would cover her face and hum and sob, which was a flirtatious cry; When Zeng Zi died, Zeng Xi actually lost his sight because of crying for his son, which was a genuine cry originating from nature; When King Xiang of Chu bid farewell to Yu Ji at Wujiang and sang loudly (Yu Xi, Yu Xi, what can I do?) and his voice and tears fell together, that was the tragic cry of a hero at the end of his road; As for the amorous Emperor Chen Houzhu who complained to people and said (I wash my face with tears here every day), that was a depressed cry recalling past glory; As for A Dou, the crown prince, who finished reciting in front of Emperor Wu of Jin, (The tombs of my ancestors are far away in Min and Shu...) Because he had no tears, he closed his eyes tightly to replace the cry, which was the child's fake cry, which was despicable and unworthy of mention.</p>
<p>However, let us not underestimate crying! The use of crying is very great! So great that it has unexpected effects! Look at Shen Baoxu of the State of Chu, who moved the (righteous indignation) of the State of Qin by crying for three days - but perhaps it was out of compassion, and the righteous army was dispatched, and the State of Chu, which had already perished, was able to be restored as a result. This kind of crying is extraordinary! Ah, just think, crying for three days, how difficult that is! This kind of crying, not to mention the State of Qin, even heaven and earth should be moved by it, and if ghosts and gods are conscious, they should cry with him, which is in accordance with the laws of heaven and human nature! However, Shen Baoxu is already an (ancient person) after all, and the present world seems to be a bit different from the (Era of the Seven Kingdoms). Therefore, when the Japanese soldiers silently seized half of our Northeast territory last year, although a certain gentleman had (grief and indignation) because of it, and a certain commander had (sobbing and speechless) because of it, they could not cry for three days after all; Because they could not cry for three days, although the cries of the two gentlemen originated from the heart, and condensed into tears, and their loyalty and sincerity were such that Heaven could testify, the League of Nations seemed to be too far inferior to the State of Qin after all, and was always unwilling to show compassion and pry open Japan's greedy mouth, to reclaim our Northeastern territory that was complete and intact!</p>
<h3>From New York to London</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>If someone came to London from New York and compared the lives of these two cities, I think he would feel a great difference.</p>
<p>The first is the slowness of life, such as the delivery of telephones, letters, transportation, the waiters in the hotel, and the shop assistants in the store, their movements are unhurried. Compared to the Americans who cut the Gordian knot quickly, we can say that London is all in a state of sleep. The second is that London has all kinds of classes: in hotels, restaurants, shops, and on the roads, we can find countless classes. As for the government, it goes without saying. This is their history, tradition, and habits, completely without the appearance of equality on the surface like New York. Nothing is unified or connected, and everything is unnecessarily complicated. The third is the incomplete equipment. In New York, due to the progress of modern scientific civilization, all material enjoyment is rapidly becoming complete; on the contrary, London's life, its scientific civilization, seems to be a century behind, making us feel very lacking in our daily lives. The fourth is the stagnation of the people's character. Compared with the Americans who are quick-witted, straightforward and sharp, they are really lagging behind. For example, when speaking, they are always mumbling and squeaking, unable to distinguish black and white immediately, which can simply drive people crazy. Sixth, there is unbearable melancholy. This will make your whole nerve feel heavy. For example, if you have breathed in the clear air of New York and suddenly come to London's humid and overcast weather, can you not feel excessively melancholy? If you feel like you were a lark soaring in the blue sky in New York, then in London you are like a nightingale groping in the dark.</p>
<p>In short, life in New York is diligent and full of struggle, while life in London is long and lazy.</p>

<h3>Forgiveness</h3>
<p>— Chuang</p>
<p>Relying on the vague image of you reborn in my soul, I feel that I still like you the most.</p>
<p>Although you once ruined the dawn of my youth, I will never forget your eyes until I die, and even more unforgettable is your clear and gentle voice, which unusually penetrated into my heart, and my chest trembled for a long, long time, like a lonely zither being plucked by slender fingers.</p>
<p>Ah! I know many women, they have bright red lips, their foreheads are delicate, and their words are gentle.</p>
<p>My friends will tell you that I sing for them, but my mother will tell you that I cry for you.</p>
<p>I cry, but my tears have gradually become scarce;</p>
<p>I used to wail, but now I only shed tears;</p>
<p>As I get older, my eyes will become stingy, and one day my sorrow will only be a kind of boredom.</p>
<p>Yes, because you once broke the flower of my youth, when I am old, I may hate you.</p>
<p>I hope your image will always be reborn in my soul! I hope that when I remember your eyes, I can deeply forgive you!</p>

<h3>Suspended Flying Railway</h3>
<p>— Qiong</p>
<p>We are now in the Speedy era, and all undertakings value speed. In addition to trams, trains, automobiles, and subways, there are even faster airplanes.</p>
<p>Of course, today's airplanes are becoming more and more safe, and they are indeed a hundred times more advanced than before. However, if the machine parts are damaged, there is still a risk of falling, and it is also bound by the weather. For example, wind and rain are unfavorable for flight. Therefore, there is now an invention of a high-speed and very safe suspended flying tram. This is a transportation tool that is not hindered by the weather and travels in the air.</p>
<p>The Suspended Flying Railway, in English, is called RailPlane, and was invented by the British George Bening. Recently, taking advantage of the British Transportation Conference, it was put into trial operation. Because it is a trial operation, of course, the horsepower cannot be too high, but the speed is still 190 kilometers per hour. Undoubtedly, this is an astonishing Speedy.</p>
<p>As for the construction cost, it is also very low. According to Bening's calculation, if it is calculated in units of 1,000 kilometers, it only costs 150,000 to 190,000 yuan (approximately 250,000 to 300,000 yuan per mile), so compared with the underground railway, which costs 4 million yuan per mile, the suburban railway, which costs 500,000 yuan per mile, and the urban tram, which costs 700,000 to 1 million yuan, it is indeed much cheaper.</p>
<p>This flying car not only has the above-mentioned amazing speed, but is also very safe. Originally, the car body was suspended in the air on a track, and there was also a safety net below, so that even if there was a machine failure, it would not fall.</p>
<p>The exterior and interior of the car body are similar to those of an airship. Both the front and rear are equipped with propellers to increase the speed of flight.</p>
<h3>What I Have Seen of French Women</h3>
<p>— Ice Lady</p>
<p>When French women are mentioned, I think many people must think that they are the most extravagant and licentious women in the world. Before I went to France, I also thought so; but after living in France for a few years, I realized that this was a big mistake.</p>
<p>French women do love to be pretty, but they are definitely not extravagant. After the war, most French women had to support themselves because they had lost their husbands or could not find husbands. Their lives were very difficult. It goes without saying that they would not be extravagant; even women who were well-off and did not have to work outside lived a very frugal life. Most of the housework is handled by the housewife herself, and very few servants are hired. I did not see any servants in the homes of several professors I visited in Paris and the surrounding areas. The professors' wives got up early every day, carried a bag to the market to buy this and that, and then came back to clean the house, mop the floor, cook, and do laundry... They were busy from morning to night, without a moment's rest. Compared with Chinese women, whose husbands earn forty or fifty yuan a month and hire maids, while they themselves are full all day long and do nothing, it is really unknown where the diligence and thrift have gone!</p>
<p>Furthermore, French women also have a commendable quality: they do not regard work as a shameful thing. When I was in Paris, I lived in the home of a music teacher for a few months through the introduction of a friend. This music teacher was an old maid who was almost forty years old. She lived with her old mother. She taught piano and earned about a thousand francs a month in tuition fees. In addition, she could earn three hundred francs a month in rent. When French people rent out their houses, they don't just give you a bare house like Chinese people, and don't care about anything. They not only have to provide the tenants with all the necessary utensils, but also have to serve the tenants. The music teacher I lived with had no servants, so everything in the house was done by the music teacher herself. Every morning, before her female students who studied piano came, she had to make my bed, dust, mop the floor, pour wash water, and do all kinds of chores. This must be a very strange thing in the eyes of Chinese women, a music teacher pouring wash water and mopping the floor for others! But in the eyes of French women, this is very normal. When the old lady cleaned my room, she jumped around and sometimes sang in a low voice, without feeling that this was a shameful thing at all. After she poured the wash water and mopped the floor, she went to teach other people's piano, without losing her status at all. I think this spirit is what Chinese women should quickly emulate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most Chinese people think that French women are licentious, which is also a mistake. Foreigners who have only traveled around Paris for a few days see those grotesque women sitting in cafes and say that French women are so and so licentious, which is inevitably close to dogmatism. According to my observation, French women, compared with women from other European countries, are considered to be the most restrained and conservative. Young girls from middle-class and above families are not easy to get close to men, and they are often accompanied by someone when they go out; even the French female students in universities are not as casual as female students from other countries in socializing with male students. In fact, if you compare French women with the so-called modern ladies in China - often modern ladies who dance with their boyfriends until late at night before returning home - the word (licentious) cannot be applied to French women at all.</p>
<p>I am not writing this short article to praise the virtues of French women; I am only doing so because I have returned after living abroad for many years, and I have seen that Chinese women (I am of course using women from the middle class as the standard) have indeed made much more progress in terms of decoration than before, but in reality, not to mention those who have not received education; those who have received education - except for a very few - still only know how to play mahjong, eat big meals, dance, and watch movies? This phenomenon is really heartbreaking, so I couldn't help but write this pile of harsh words.</p>

<h3>Crossroads of the Era and Love - Part 3</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>What a great opportunity! Professor Zeng has returned to Hong Kong to see his second wife. He won't be back for two weeks. Old Lin, this is truly a good chance!</p>
<p>(You're talking nonsense!)</p>
<p>Haiquan continued to ponder, could it be that Old Tang truly saw through his inner thoughts? He could swear that he held no expectations of Crane Child (Tsuruko) beyond the ordinary. However, recently, the image of Crane Child often appeared in his mind, which was a genuine fact. As for why her beautiful image had invaded his consciousness, he was at a loss. Moreover, her image appeared more and more frequently, and the color of the image became increasingly deeper and richer.</p>
<p>(Lately, haven't I been wanting to go home from school early? The clear purpose is to see her...)</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he felt a little ashamed again.</p>
<p>(...Could this be what is called love?)</p>
<p>He sat in the car thinking for a long time, only to realize that the atmosphere around him was a bit cold. The morning had been filled with warm sunshine. After lunch, the sky was densely covered with deep gray, chaotic clouds. The cold wind of early winter swept up the dust and sand on the road, hitting him from the side. He felt a slight shiver and his face felt rough.</p>
<p>He took his hand out of his pocket and touched his cheeks.</p>
<p>Professor Zeng's residence was at the northern end of F Bridge, right behind the nine-story Western-style apartment building. The car stopped in front of the Zeng residence. Haiquan had just paid the fare and was about to press the doorbell when Crane Child came out from inside and opened the outer iron gate.</p>
<p>(Mr. Lin, are you cold?)</p>
<p>(I didn't expect the weather to change so quickly, Aunt Zeng.)</p>
<p>(Oh dear, you're calling me "aunt" again. I really don't want to be so old).</p>
<p>She said with a smile, then followed him inside. As soon as they stepped into the living room, they felt a wave of warmth; it turned out the furnace in the hall had coal added and was burning.</p>
<p>(It's too late today. I must get a stove installed in your room tomorrow).</p>
<p>She said this after asking him to sit down.</p>
<p>(No need for a stove. I don't want a stove in my room. I'm not afraid of the cold).</p>
<p>(Mr. Lin, I heard your teacher say that Shanghai is much colder than your southern climate. Without a stove, you can't get through the winter). Haiquan also felt that the weather in Shanghai was much colder than in the South. According to the lunar calendar, it was only mid-November, but it felt like December in the south.</p>
<p>(Installing a stove is certainly desirable, but I'm afraid it will cost a lot of money. The money for the stove is limited. But burning coal for a winter is indeed not an easy burden. There are many people in my family, and expenses are high. My father's income is just enough for expenses each year. Fortunately, my brother-in-law provides a little support. Otherwise, how could I have come to Shanghai to attend university?)</p>
<p>He was lost in thought when he suddenly heard Crane Child calling him.</p>
<p>(Mr. Lin, you have several letters. I was so busy talking to you that I forgot about your letters).</p>
<p>As she spoke, she stood up, walked to the desk by the window, opened a drawer, took out three letters, and handed them to Haiquan.</p>
<p>He took them and saw that one was a family letter from his old father, one was from his elder sister, and one was from his brother-in-law's younger sister, Liu Peizhu. The father's letter was the most ordinary, simply saying that if possible during the New Year holiday, he should return to his hometown to see his family, primarily because his old grandmother hoped very much that he would return and celebrate the New Year happily with everyone. However, the sister's letter surprised him a little, because this letter was not sent from Guangzhou as before, but from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(Has their family moved to Hong Kong)?</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>What's Going On?</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Since the theft and sale case at the Palace Museum, what is the true story behind the scenes? It's truly baffling, leaving people scratching their heads. Was it theft and sale, or not? If it was, who were the thieves? And did they sell 300,000 items, or 700,000, or even more? Were the items sold truly discarded objects with feudal-era characteristics, or were things that were not discarded and did not have feudal characteristics also stolen and sold? This case has been going on for a long time, and it's still a mystery. Recently, the Control Yuan sent personnel to investigate and prepare for impeachment, but it will probably be difficult to completely clarify the situation. Such a serious case of theft and sale is like a headless murder. We must ask detective expert Sherlock Holmes to investigate.</p>
<p>Before this case is resolved, there is suddenly talk of moving the Palace Museum's antiquities to Luoyang. Stealing and selling antiquities is one matter, and moving antiquities is another. But are these two cases related, or are they completely unrelated? Outsiders naturally find it even more unfathomable and difficult to understand the truth. However, according to recent news reports, the news about moving antiquities is quite bizarre. According to a Beijing dispatch on the 24th, all sectors of Beijing opposed the relocation of antiquities to Luoyang and issued five reasons, which seemed quite reasonable. On the 30th, there were two more Beijing dispatches, one from Yi Peiji denying the relocation of Palace Museum antiquities to Luoyang, and one from Chu Minyi stating that Palace Museum antiquities would be moved to Luoyang. Who is advocating for the relocation after all? And for what reason is it necessary to move them to Luoyang? And who are the people who are advocating against it? Are the five reasons given truly factual? This kind of mystery can only be solved by going to the City God Temple to ask for a divination slip.</p>
<p>In short, "roaming the sea as a pirate" is something the ancients warned against. Now I don't blame anyone else. I only blame our country for having too many antiquities, and the antiquities being too good. Not only do foreigners covet them, but even Chinese people are thinking about turning them around. It's truly like the two common sayings, "telling a beggar to hide, there's no place to put them" and "black eyes see white silver." I am very worried about these things and feel sorry for them.</p>
<h3>A Manager with Influence</h3>
<p>— Yijing Studio Owner</p>
<p>In an office, a glass window horizontally shields a narrow loft. In a corner of the loft, piles of various-colored account books are stacked high. Next to the loft, Manager Wang, around forty years old, sits in a swivel chair. His clothes are dull and lusterless, and a large piece of the cuff is torn, revealing the cotton inside.</p>
<p>The Western-style door slowly opened, and a thin, sallow-faced young clerk walked in, wearing a tattered free-cloth robe. He spoke with pleading sobs: "Mr. Wang, tomorrow is my father's sixtieth birthday. I was hoping to ask for a few days off to go back to my hometown. Please grant my request."</p>
<p>"Impossible. Impossible," Manager Wang replied with a frown.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, this is my father's special occasion. Please allow me this time. I promise I won't go again," the thin young man pleaded tremulously.</p>
<p>"Bah! Stop your rambling! If you want to go, then just quit! Alright, and don't bother coming back. There are plenty of people here; we can manage without you. Hahaha, people as poor as you have no right to celebrate birthdays. You'd be better off saving your money." Manager Wang showed his disgust at the man's nagging.</p>
<p>"Yes! I won't go," the thin young man's head slowly drooped. Tears welled in his eyes as he said this and walked out, crestfallen.</p>
<p>Next, a young clerk in a Western suit walked in, his steps...</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang, please sit down, please sit down," Manager Wang said with a nodding smile.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, I want to go back to my hometown today because the day after tomorrow is my uncle's fiftieth death anniversary," the young man in the Western suit said with an air of importance.</p>
<p>"Excellent, excellent. You should go home when there's a family matter. You and I are close friends, there's no reason to refuse you. You don't need to be so polite." Manager Wang replied hurriedly.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, goodbye," the young man in the Western suit said triumphantly and left.</p>
<p>Literature</p>
<h3>Lament of Unemployment</h3>
<p>— Qin Nan</p>
<p>This summer, a certain gentleman graduated from high school and often visited my residence. Whenever we discussed his background, he would sigh deeply. This poem is written to record his situation.</p>
<p>I remember when I was young, I entered a private school, and studied the Analects and Mencius in order. My father also knew the importance of modern times and ordered me to study new subjects. After four years of primary school, I happily graduated, smiling and pointing to my diploma, I said to him, "I was illiterate when I was young, only knowing how to till the fields. Now you have studied for seven or eight years, your knowledge is a hundred times higher than mine. From now on, you only need to choose a skill, and you will have no worries for the rest of your life." At that time, I was only thirteen years old, able to look at both sides and express my aspirations. But today's affairs are so chaotic, and young people seek knowledge haphazardly. The new system of junior high school has a short term, and the burden does not require large sums. Parents love their children sincerely, so they let the studies be interrupted halfway. In autumn, they send me to the city. The east and west winds are bleak, and the rain is misty. I struggle to pay for food and lodging, and my son can study diligently with peace of mind. Time flies like an arrow, year after year, my grades are listed at the forefront, and my reputation is brilliant. Hiring letters arrive every day, advising me to teach at the neighboring elementary school. But the salary is meager, and the monthly income of ten gold is not enough. A man should have high ambitions. Having obtained Long, can I not hope for Shu again? High school is expected to be completed, and parents are overjoyed to hear this. My family had no fertile fields, so where could I get the money to provide for me? Alas, the efforts to raise money were now like a dream. I finally looked forward to graduation, and my heart and strength were exhausted. I obtained a degree, but I had been hesitating for nearly half a year, wandering on the crossroads. Don't you see that there are as many university students as crucian carp these days? Counting on my fingers, how many people have a proper occupation?</p>

<h3>Sympathizer (Continued Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>(On the threshing ground)</p>
<p>In front of Wang Lao Er's (Wang the Second) gate, there was a threshing ground. The ground was leveled and smoothed by stone rollers, so that any stray grains could be easily swept up during threshing. In front of the threshing ground, there was a row of trees. Beyond that was a clear pond. At night, the cool breeze blew from the water, making this an excellent place to cool off. So, after sunset, after eating dinner, Wang Lao San (Wang the Third) would carry a bucket of hot water and a bath basin to bathe under a short tree by the pond. After bathing, he would change into a pair of old and tattered pants, put on a pair of shoes that were only half intact, and then move a bamboo bed to rest in the breeze. His discarded pants and leftover water would be taken care of by the person who tended the stove. This night, there was a large moon, illuminating the threshing ground like a thin layer of snow. Wang Lao Er's wife was carrying a water bucket and bath basin, passing through the threshing ground and heading towards the gate, when Meng Guobao happened to walk by and called out, "Lao Er!" Wang Lao Er heard Meng's voice. He jumped up from the bamboo bed and said, "Oh! Mr. Meng, please sit down, please sit down. It's rare to have such a distinguished guest." Meng Guobao said, "What distinguished guest? My house and your house aren't even a hundred steps apart." Wang Lao Er fanned the bamboo bed with his banana leaf fan and said with a smile, "Please sit down, please sit down." Meng Guobao said, "I won't stand on ceremony," and sat down on the bamboo bed. Wang Lao Er then said to his wife, "Hurry and boil water for tea and stir-fry a plate of pumpkin seeds." His wife responded loudly with an "Oh!" Wang Lao Er was very polite. He was afraid that sitting together on a bamboo bed would be a bit unsuitable in the hot weather, so he sat on a stone roller opposite the bamboo bed. Meng Guobao said with a smile, "Lao Er, I just saw your sister-in-law carrying a bath basin and bucket inside. From the looks of it, she's not just tending the stove, but also doing chores for you. Isn't calling her the stove tender an incomplete description?" Wang Lao Er laughed and said, "How is it that Mr. Meng still remembers what I said during the day?" Meng Guobao smiled and said, "Because you and your sister-in-law don't call her anything when you talk to her. You just say your words louder, and she understands. Chinese people are really strange. Husbands and wives don't call each other by name. At most, they just say 'Hey.' The closest relationship should be with one's wife, but brothers, sisters, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, everyone in the family can be called something. Why is it that when it comes to husband and wife, they can't be addressed? Because of this, I thought of what you said during the day." Wang Lao Er laughed heartily and said, "That's a joke. Surely, I wouldn't call her 'stove tender this' and 'stove tender that,' would I?" As he said this, his new daughter-in-law carried a square stool out from the gate. Hearing this, she scolded softly, "You're talking nonsense again!" It seemed she was very averse to the term "stove tender." After saying these four words, she quietly placed the square stool in front of the bamboo bed and then brought a pottery teapot and two pairs of rice bowls. Wang Lao Er stood up and poured two bowls of tea, saying with a smile, "The bowls aren't good, but this tea is some Kill Two Tips tea that I brought from the mountains. You probably can't buy it in the city." Meng Guobao picked up the bowl and took a sip. Although the tea had a bit of a fragrant aroma, the bowl had a bit of rapeseed oil taste. Without saying a word, he put it down. Wang Lao Er held the bowl in both hands, like a monkey holding a peach, drinking it with great relish. His daughter-in-law came out again, still without saying a word, and placed a plate of freshly stir-fried pumpkin seeds on the square stool. Meng Guobao saw that she seemed afraid of people but not quite. Country women had a different kind of charm. In the moonlight, he saw that she had changed into a coarse summer cloth jacket, with her sleeves rolled up high. Under the hair on her ears, there were three or four jasmine flowers, which the country people called bathing flowers. Seeing that there were no wrinkles on her clothes, it seemed that she had also taken a bath and changed into fresh clothes. After she put down the pumpkin seeds, she didn't go back into the gate. Taking the palm-leaf fan in her hand, she fanned the dust off the stone steps and sat down on the steps. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Brief History of a Star</p>
<h3>Anecdotes About Frank Buck, Author of "Bring 'Em Back Alive"</h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen "Bring 'Em Back Alive" at the Nanjing Grand Theatre can feel how easily Frank Buck captured tigers, leopards, snakes, and other poisonous insects and wild beasts. Some may find it strange. But according to Frank himself, catching wild beasts is very simple. There is nothing strange about it. First, you only need to understand the temperament of the wild beasts, and second, you must have the courage and physical strength to adapt to the situation. Frank undoubtedly looks like a rough man. He can be extremely calm in dangerous situations, but cultural products such as telephones and underground railways make him feel uneasy. Once, on a ship, an orangutan escaped from its cage and approached him. At the critical moment, Frank punched the orangutan in the jaw and knocked it down. At that time, not only could he not get a gun, but he didn't even have time to turn around. So Frank is indeed a mentally and physically agile person.</p>
<p>Where did Frank get this strength and skill? It was probably inherited from his father. His father was originally a hunter. Even at the age of eighty-four, he still went fishing every day. When Frank was eight years old, he made a living by catching rattlesnakes. He caught these poisonous snakes and sold them to traveling medicine peddlers for five cents each. These traveling doctors bought them to make medicine, which was said to cure rheumatism. This is exactly in line with what is seen in southern Chinese society.</p>
<p>When Frank was seventeen, he "cherished great ambitions" to catch wild beasts. He secretly ran away from home and went to Chicago first. There was a small restaurant there, and he worked as a waiter. He worked hard. After accumulating some money, he went to South America. In South America, he made a living by catching birds. He caught the birds and sold them in the United States. In this way, his hunting career became more and more prosperous day by day. Later, he was even able to set up an agency in Singapore in the East. This was the beginning of his hunting for wild beasts in the forests around Singapore.</p>
<p>Frank's life is very profitable. Some birds can sell for a thousand gold dollars each. An elephant can sell for more than two thousand five hundred gold dollars. Circuses, zoos, and various private gardens are all his sales venues. He is from Texas, so most of the wild beasts in the zoos in the cities of Texas are supplied by Frank. It is said that there are as many as seventy-two kinds of rare birds and animals.</p>
<p>According to Frank himself, he waited three weeks before the fight between the python and the tiger, because he found that the python had just swallowed a wild boar. The wild boar would take at least eleven days to digest in the python's stomach, so it would not go out to look for food until it was hungry again, and only then could it fight with the tiger. But the python and the tiger fought so much, but neither was seriously injured, and both were able to "retreat with their whole army," which is a bit strange. But to say it's fake, it's so lifelike.</p>
<p>Frank is now forty-two years old, six feet tall, and has a very rough appearance, but he has a very beautiful wife. It is said that they have never argued since they got married. This wife is his second wife. Because Frank had already married a woman who was ten years older than him when he was nineteen. But later, that woman felt uneasy about being an older wife to a younger husband, so she retreated to the ranks of friends. So Frank remarried this young and beautiful woman. They also have a daughter, who is now eight months old.</p>
<p>Currently, Cathay is showing a historical secret from twenty years ago, "Five Star Final," starring Edward G. Robinson.</p>

<h3>Wang Fuqing is Going Abroad</h3>
<p>— Qingxia</p>
<p>Wang Fuqing has been in the film industry for more than ten years. He founded the Great East Golden Lion Company himself. His first production, "Spring Breeze and Willows," is about to be completed, with only a few outdoor scenes remaining to be filmed. A few days ago, he specially sent someone to Xia Peizhen's home, asking Xia to come to Great East in three days, and then go to Suzhou together to shoot outdoor scenes, because he hoped that this "Spring Breeze and Willows" would be completed in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>But he is not just rushing to complete this "Spring Breeze and Willows," it is really because after he finishes "Spring Breeze and Willows," he wants to go to the United States to investigate on the ground. As for all the affairs of the company, he said his cousin Shen Zhiyuan can act as his agent.</p>
<p>We said in the article, we sincerely hope that Mr. Wang will work hard for the film industry with 120 points of sincerity. He should be single-minded and persevering to cultivate this precarious domestic film industry. He goes abroad this time, and when he returns home one day, the second production of Great East may make a surprising contribution.</p>

<h3>Those Engaged in Art Should Accept the Opinions of the Audience</h3>
<p>— Yi Lie</p>
<p>Since the creation of this magazine, in a short month, many loyal readers have expressed their opinions every day. Whether the film companies, directors, actors, and the authorities of various theaters have accepted and implemented the fair criticisms, sincere suggestions, and honest warnings of the audience—that is, the readers of this magazine—is a matter of concern and knowledge for those who love movies.</p>
<p>The opinions published by all the companies in this magazine are the sincere expressions of those who love movies, and they are all based on facts and theories. Will the film companies, directors, actors, and theaters adopt them? Or will they treat them like wind in their ears? The audience has no right to interfere, but I think that those engaged in film art will not be so stubborn and go their own way.</p>
<h3>"Lianhua Weekly" is Published Today</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The film magazine, which has been suspended for a year, was originally published by Lianhua Company. Recently, there was news of its revival, which this magazine reported earlier. It is now known that the magazine has not been revived, but the preparers of Lianhua are actually the reincarnation of the magazine, named "Lianhua Weekly." The magazine is edited by playwright Wang Shaoqing. The inaugural issue is scheduled to be published today, and various theaters will have it for sale.</p>
