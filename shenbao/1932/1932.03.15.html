<p>時評</p>
<h3>吾人所貢獻於國聯調查團者（一）彬</h3>
<p>國聯調查團已於日昨到滬。我們對於此一行遠涉重洋。負有爲人類維護和平與正義之重責的來賓。謹特表示歡迎與欽敬的誠意。同時更敬致其誠摯的貢獻。</p>
<p>國聯調查團此來中國其目的爲調查東北。但今日船入吳淞。方踏入中國的土地。即可望見吳淞要塞上迎風飄揚着表示侵略與强横的太陽旗。慘淡而又嚴肅的陽光下。縱横狼藉着碎瓦與頽垣。戰壘宛在。彈痕猶新。由今日戰後的慘狀。即可推知一二八以後一月又二天砲火的荼毒。此種最先入目之印象。應爲調查團諸君始料所不及。</p>
<p>去年九一八日軍突佔東北此次又再犯上海。他們舉以宣告世界的理由。爲制止中國抗日運動。但抗日運動爲果。日本對我積極侵略激起我國民之憤恨爲因。此應爲世界人士所灼知。最近美國發生排斥日貨運動。又不是一二八日軍再犯上海後所激起的果嗎。日種惡因。乃收惡果。正如種瓜得瓜。種豆得豆。事所必然。此點在國聯所委託上海領事團調查眞相的報告書中。也曾指。出此種極顯明之因果關係。日人竟不能體認明白。恰如西哲耶穌所謂「只看見他人眼裏的刺。忘却了自已眼裏横着大樑木。」如日人能拔去自已眼中的大樑木。吾人拔去眼中的剌自然絲毫不成問題。所以日人所謂制止抗日運動。不過爲其一種飾辭。此爲我們誠摯貢獻於調查團諸君的第一點。國聯盟約第十條明白規定。有『聯合會盟員有尊重並保持所有聯合會各盟員領土之完全及現有政治上之獨立。以防禦外來侵略之義務』的條文。九國公約的原則。亦爲尊重中國領土完整。主權獨立。最近美史汀生致波拉函。也鄭重重申此義及門户開放的原則。日本今日竟悍然無所顧惜。撕碎了國聯盟約與九國公約。破壞了門户開放的原則。背棄國際信義。非特直接迫害中國。亦且是直接迫害世界。</p>
<p>日本對世界宣稱。謂「滿蒙成立新政權後。仍歡迎各國投資。仍保持門户開放的原則。」我們試思日本對於國際盟約旣絶不顧惜對世界輿論。亦毫無顧忌。决然破壞中國領土行政主權之完整。以求滿足其侵略的野心。以實現其所謂「國防計劃。」事實上東北已爲日本所獨占。而謂其仍將保持門户開放的原則。即三尺孩提。當亦知其不可能。所以日本一面破壞中國領土行政主權之完整。一面口頭欺騙各國。高唱門户開放。仍是違背國聯盟約與九國公約的精神。我們爲必保障中國領土行政主權之完整。而後可以言門户開放。此爲我們誠摯貢獻於調查團諸君的第二點。</p>

<h3>可免解散劫運</h3>
<p>倫敦孟却斯德指導報今日社評謂日本在滿洲與上海之侵略、其託詞脆弱易折、敢謂無出其右、國聯如不能終止日本之敵對行動、或阻止被攻者之續受蹂躪、則愈早解散、爲益愈大、惟自中國申請召集國聯議會、以制行政會後國聯得免遭此劫運、蓋諸小國均獲擁護國聯會章原則之機會、此種原則、已爲行政會紆曲多文陷於迷離恍惚中矣、該報結語云、吾人當可深信新委員會之辦事、其奮勵心遠勝行政會也、（路透社十四日電）</p>
<p>國聯團員來滬聲中</p>
<h3>日軍掩飾耳目</h3>
<p>國聯遼案調查團、昨已由日抵滬上海日軍、近雖宣稱和平、而援兵仍繼續開來、惟爲塗飾耳目、不使擴大戰區痕跡、爲委員團所知、趕將已到吳淞口外陸軍、乘委員團未到之先、運到上海、一面又將浦江大隊日艦、暫時開往他處、茲將日軍最近行動、查報如下、</p>
<h3>援軍趕裝來滬</h3>
<p>十二日以前、日軍續到大批陸軍、足有八千名以上、而自十三日起、吳淞口外、日本軍艦中、尙有繼續運來日本援兵四千至五千名左右、趕派運輸船江南丸·交趾丸·筑前丸·等三輪、並日本軍艦一艘、護送到滬、此項兵士統在楊樹浦方面登陸、前昨兩日該項日軍到滬時、在軍工路列隊行走、隨帶軍火頗多、有多數調至前方、與下元旅團調防、</p>
<h3>淞滬日艦避開</h3>
<p>在吳淞口外</p>
<p>日本軍艦、卸去軍隊後、已有多艘、離開該處、而在黄浦江内日本軍艦、昨日亦已奉到野村之命、暫時開離上海、計有第二隊魚雷兩艘·十五隊驅逐艦一般·二十二隊驅逐艦三艘·及砲艦一艘·統皆駛往揚子江各口岸、使國聯委員團不能目覩、其用心至爲狡猾、</p>
<h3>擅開淞滬火車</h3>
<p>淞滬路、全入日軍勢力範圍内、並將損壞路軌修竣、爲其便利軍運計、昨已將該路蒸汽客車兩輛、自下午起開始行駛、專供日軍往來淞滬江灣之用、不許華人乘搭、</p>
<h3>英使視察陣地</h3>
<p>閘北·江灣·大塲·吳淞　·瀏河·各地、日軍占領區域、英國公使藍溥森偕同上海英法美各領事、特往視察、聞由野村等陪同觀看、以備國聯委員團諮詢時、有所根據答復、</p>
<h3>安保昨日返國</h3>
<p>日前海相安保大將、來滬視察戰區、並與白川植田等接洽軍事、刻以所事已畢、昨乘龍田軍艦離滬歸國、先一日、白川等在出雲旗艦餞送又日皇所派前綫慰勞大員侍從武官出光氏、昨聞携帶日皇所頒御紋章、奬給白川植田等員、另有烟酒等項、發給各官兵、對於廟行戰死中級軍官林八·大澤少佐·等二十九人、均予追升官級、</p>
<h3>日船開行商班</h3>
<p>上海日輪、在戰後全部充供軍用、茲國聯調查團到滬、日軍爲粉飾和平起見、將徵用商船、先放回一部、授意日淸日郵社、將長江班内岳陽丸·襄陽丸·從昨晨起、開始開航、每星期開一班、其他如宜陽·雲陽·長陽·大貞·大福·等輪、仍代日軍運輸、又日郵社之中日班輪·昨亦令上海丸開行商班、但僅有少數日僑乘搭、並無貨物裝載、此外沿海日輪、又無復業希望、惟滬地日貨之私運往天津者甚多、東洋棉紗、已裝去五千件矣、</p>
<p>日人竭力</p>
<h3>掩藏閘北慘狀</h3>
<p>希圖朦蔽國聯團員耳目國聯調查團、昨已抵滬、在此間約有一星期之勾留、並將往閘北·吳淞·江灣·等戰區視察、聞日本軍事當局、希圖掩飾團員耳目起見、已於最近兩日中、命閘北等處之駐軍暫爲隱藏撤退、並利用漢奸、在各處要隘屋頂、懸掛中華國旗以示無佔領我土地之野心、又將北區及虹口一帶與華界接壤處小弄路口之鐵絲網頽垣瓦礫等、一併淸除、閘北江灣一帶日人所留之一切慘象及死屍殘骸等、亦均竭力泯滅埋葬、俾調查團團員前往視察時可减少日人兇暴之遺跡云、</p>
<h3>日本態度强硬</h3>
<p>準備和戰並進</p>
<p>日文報大阪每日新聞云、據陸軍當局所言、自中國軍總退却以來、我方急欲確立停戰狀態、然鑒於過去之事實、尙未明瞭中國軍之眞意、故對於部署已畢之兵力、仍須開拔上海云、</p>
<p>神户又新日報云、據白川軍司令官之聲明、今後我國（日本）依列國之協調、措置上海事件之善後、惟在解决未了期内、我陸軍仍整頓隊伍、在和戰兩途準備云、</p>
<p>東京朝日新聞云、上海圓桌會議、中國方面以日本完全撤兵、爲先决條件、故開會之期、尙難决定、我因中國之固執條件、流會亦未可知、而軍部方面多主張中國除外、與其他各國間、維持上海方面之治安、並規定警備問題、然上海爲利害關係錯雜之地、究竟關係各國、對於此種重要規定、能否承諾、頗爲欵問、否則、我方（日本）至實現困難時、應常駐必要兵力、一方與中國政府斷絶外交關係、目下對華强硬論、已漸有力化云、</p>
<h3>上海停戰會議</h3>

<h3>What We Offer to the League of Nations Investigation Team (1) Bin</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Team arrived in Shanghai yesterday. We extend our sincere welcome and respect to these guests who have traveled far across the oceans, bearing the heavy responsibility of upholding peace and justice for mankind. At the same time, we respectfully offer them our sincere contributions.</p>
<p>The purpose of the League of Nations Investigation Team's visit to China is to investigate the Northeast. However, today, as their ship entered Wusong and they set foot on Chinese soil, they could immediately see the sun flag, symbolizing aggression and tyranny, flying in the wind over the Wusong fortress. Under the bleak and solemn sunlight, shattered tiles and crumbling walls were scattered in disarray. The battlements remained, and the bullet marks were still fresh. From the tragic aftermath of today's battle, one can infer the devastation wrought by the month and two days of artillery fire after January 28th. This first impression should be something that the gentlemen of the investigation team did not expect.</p>
<p>Last year, on September 18th, the Japanese army suddenly occupied the Northeast, and now they have invaded Shanghai again. The reason they declared to the world was to stop the anti-Japanese movement in China. However, the anti-Japanese movement is the result, and Japan's active aggression against us, which aroused the resentment of our people, is the cause. This should be clearly understood by people around the world. Recently, the movement to boycott Japanese goods in the United States is also a result triggered by the Japanese army's invasion of Shanghai after January 28th. Planting evil causes yields evil results, just as planting melons yields melons and planting beans yields beans. This is inevitable. This point was also pointed out in the report of the Shanghai Consular Body, entrusted by the League of Nations to investigate the truth, which pointed out this very obvious cause-and-effect relationship. The Japanese were unable to understand it clearly, just like the Western philosopher Jesus said, "You see the speck in your neighbor's eye, but fail to notice the beam in your own eye." If the Japanese can remove the beam from their own eyes, then our removal of the speck from our eyes will naturally not be a problem at all. Therefore, what the Japanese call stopping the anti-Japanese movement is merely a kind of embellishment. This is the first point that we sincerely offer to the gentlemen of the investigation team. Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant clearly stipulates that "Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League." The principle of the Nine-Power Treaty is also to respect China's territorial integrity and sovereign independence. Recently, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson's letter to Borah also solemnly reiterated this meaning and the principle of the Open Door Policy. Today, Japan brazenly disregards everything, tearing up the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty, destroying the principle of the Open Door Policy, and betraying international trust. This is not only directly persecuting China, but also directly persecuting the world.</p>
<p>Japan declared to the world that "after the establishment of a new regime in Manchuria and Mongolia, it still welcomes foreign investment and maintains the principle of the Open Door Policy." Let us think about it. Since Japan absolutely disregards international covenants and has no scruples about world opinion, it resolutely destroys China's territorial and administrative sovereignty in order to satisfy its aggressive ambitions and realize its so-called "national defense plan." In fact, the Northeast has already been monopolized by Japan, and to say that it will still maintain the principle of the Open Door Policy is something that even a three-foot-tall child would know is impossible. Therefore, while destroying China's territorial and administrative sovereignty, Japan verbally deceives various countries and loudly proclaims the Open Door Policy, which still violates the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty. We believe that only by ensuring the integrity of China's territorial and administrative sovereignty can we talk about the Open Door Policy. This is the second point that we sincerely offer to the gentlemen of the investigation team.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Investigation Team Arrived in Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Incident is Also Within the Scope of Investigation</p>
<p>A Stay of About One Week in Shanghai, or Possibly Longer</p>
<p>Reception for the Press at 6:00 PM Today</p>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Team, including five commissioners from the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, and Germany, as well as accompanying staff and experts, arrived in Shanghai on the 11th of this month aboard the President Adams of the Dollar Steamship Lines, from Japan. Originally scheduled to arrive at 4:00 PM yesterday, they were delayed by fog and wind, and finally arrived at Bailianjing, Pudong, at 7:30 PM last night. Government representatives Gu Weijun, Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, and Municipal Secretary-General Yu Hongjun boarded the ship to welcome them. They then accompanied the team members and others on a ferry prepared for them, arriving at the Customs Wharf at around 9:00 PM. After landing, they went directly to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund to rest. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Crowds of Welcoming Representatives</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese and foreign representatives who went to the Customs Wharf to welcome the team were extremely crowded. They arrived in succession from around 2:00 PM. Welcoming slogans were visible everywhere. Outside the iron gate of the wharf, there were hundreds of people standing and looking into the distance, all wanting to catch a glimpse of the members of the League of Nations Investigation Team, who bear the mission of peace. The reception prepared two ferries for the welcoming personnel to ride on. A portion waited at the Customs Wharf. Chinese and foreign welcoming representatives included, on the government side, representatives Gu Weijun, Secretary-General Wang Guangqi, Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Zhang Xueliang's representative Zhou Tianfang, Ministry of Military Affairs representative Zhang Wen, Ministry of the Navy representative Zheng Liqing, League of Nations Chinese Secretary Wu Xiufeng, and group representatives, from the business community Yuan Ludeng, Bei Songsun, from the banking community Chen Zheqing, Xu Xinliu, from the press Dong Xianguang, from academia Li Zhaohuan, Wang Jingqi, from the Pacific Society Chen Liting, etc. On the foreign side, there were the investigation team's secretary Chapelet, advisor Dr. Young, U.S. Embassy Secretary Engert, U.S. Administrative Consul McHugh, Zhang Xueliang's advisor Dunne, Shanghai Volunteer Corps Commander Johnson, and on the Japanese side, representative to the League Aizawa Matuoka, Japanese Embassy Secretary Horiuchi.</p>
<h3>Grand Arrival at the Port</h3>
<p>The President Adams, the ship on which the investigation team members were traveling, entered the Wusongkou at 6:00 PM yesterday evening and arrived at Pudong Bailianjing Wharf at 7:30 PM. Representatives Gu, Vice Minister Guo, Mayor Wu, and other reception personnel, at 7:20 PM, took a special small ferry from the Customs Wharf across the river to Pudong to welcome them. Around 8:00 PM, they arrived at the Bailianjing Wharf. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Police Brigade, and a military band were lined up at the wharf, playing music to welcome them, with very thorough security measures. Soon, the welcoming personnel boarded the President Adams and met with the investigation commissioners in the lounge, shaking hands one by one and exchanging greetings. Dr. Gu Shaochuan introduced the welcoming personnel to the commissioners. About a quarter of an hour later, Mr. Gu led the welcoming personnel to guide the members of the team, their staff and experts ashore in succession. At that time, military music was played loudly on the pier and magnesium lights flashed as photographers competed to take pictures of the commissioners. They then boarded a small ferry across the river. The commissioners sat in the middle cabin with Gu Shaochuan, Guo Taiqi, Wu Tiecheng and others. At 9:00 PM, they arrived at the Customs Wharf. Representatives from various public groups and organizations had been waiting for a long time. When the members of the investigation team landed, they stepped forward to shake hands and greet them. Hundreds of representatives of civil groups gathered on the lawn of the Bund, all holding welcoming flags. As the team members approached, they applauded and shouted slogans. The team members stopped briefly to look at the words on the flags, and the reception staff explained them. Then they boarded cars and went to the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road to rest. Also, yesterday, all the shops along the roads posted slogans welcoming the members of the investigation team and respecting public law and treaties.</p>
<h3>Japanese Representatives Arrived Together</h3>
<p>This time, the League of Nations Investigation Team passed through Japan and stayed for a few days. The people of Japan, both in and out of the government, treated them with the utmost hospitality. Before their departure, the Japanese government specially sent 13 representatives, including the ambassador to Germany, Yoshida, to accompany the investigation team on their voyage to Shanghai. In addition to Yoshida, notable individuals included Kanzō Shiozaki, former director of the Treaty Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Colonel Wataru from the Army Ministry, Lieutenant Commander Sumida from the Navy Ministry, Setsuichi Aoki, Director of the Tokyo Branch of the International Association, and officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Masaomi Yoshitomi and Kifune.</p>
<h3>Sir Lytton Expresses</h3>
<p>The chairman of the League of Nations Investigation Team, Sir Lytton of the United Kingdom, was wearing a blue coat. Although he was old, he was full of energy and amiable. A reporter from this newspaper, introduced by Dr. Gu Weijun, shook hands with the Sir on the ship and had a brief conversation. The reporter (asked): Your team passed through Japan this time and stayed for a short time. I don't know what your impression of Japan is? (Answer): We received great hospitality in Japan and felt very happy. However, we had to depart in a hurry and did not have time to investigate in detail, which is regrettable. (Asked) How many days will you stay in Shanghai? (Answer) It is not yet decided. After consulting with all parties, the stay in Shanghai may be slightly extended, etc. At that time, there were many welcomers, and Mr. Lytton was busy. He said to the reporter, there is no time for a long conversation, I plan to meet with the press at the hotel at 6 pm tomorrow (today), and we will talk in detail at that time.</p>
<h3>German Commissioner Speaks</h3>
<p>The German representative, Dr. Schnee, is a well-known expert on colonial policy and has lived in the Far East for many years. A reporter met with Dr. Schnee at the Cathay Hotel last night. According to Dr. Schnee, the investigation team will stay in Shanghai for about a week, but if necessary, they may have to stay a few more days. This trip will also include the Shanghai case within the scope of the investigation. Dr. Schnee was in good spirits and had binoculars hanging on his chest, as in the photograph published in this newspaper yesterday. He asked the reporter about the year the Cathay Hotel was built and the origin of its name, which was quite interesting.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Prepares Reception</h3>
<p>After the League of Nations Investigation Team arrived in Shanghai, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce scheduled a banquet for the evening of the 18th to present everything. Yuan Ludeng and Bei Songsun were publicly elected to handle the reception of the team with special responsibility. Also, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the chairman of the League of Nations Investigation Team, Sir Lytton, from the President Adams: Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, I acknowledge your telegram of welcome from you and the gentlemen of your association, and my colleagues and I are inexplicably grateful, Lytton.</p>
<p>British-American Hope</p>
<h3>New Resolution Takes Effect</h3>
<p>London - After returning to London today, British Foreign Secretary Simon told a Reuters reporter that he hoped that the resolution passed by the League of Nations Council could ultimately lead to a solution to the Far East issue. He also said that U.S. Secretary of State Stimson sent a telegram to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, expressing the United States' support for this resolution and its intention to assist the League of Nations' policy, which he was very pleased with. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>British Newspaper Comments on the League of Nations</p>
<h3>Can Avoid Dissolution</h3>
<p>London - The Manchester Guardian commented today that Japan's aggression in Manchuria and Shanghai is based on the weakest of pretexts. If the League of Nations cannot end Japan's hostile actions or prevent the continued devastation of the attacked, the sooner it dissolves, the better. However, since China applied to convene the League of Nations Council to restrain the Executive Council, the League of Nations was spared this catastrophe. All the small countries have the opportunity to uphold the principles of the League of Nations Charter, which have been obscured by the tortuous language of the Executive Council. The newspaper concluded, "We can be confident that the new committee will work with far more vigor than the Executive Council." (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Amidst the Sound of the League of Nations Team's Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Conceals the Truth</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Manchurian Investigation Team arrived in Shanghai from Japan yesterday. Although the Japanese army in Shanghai has recently declared peace, reinforcements continue to arrive. However, in order to conceal the truth and prevent the committee team from seeing the traces of the expanded war zone, they rushed to transport the army that had arrived outside Wusongkou to Shanghai before the arrival of the committee team. At the same time, they temporarily sailed the Japanese warships of the Pudong fleet to other places. The recent actions of the Japanese army are investigated and reported as follows:</p>
<h3>Reinforcements Rushed to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Before the 12th, a large number of Japanese troops continued to arrive, amounting to more than 8,000. Since the 13th, there have been approximately 4,000 to 5,000 Japanese reinforcements continuously transported on Japanese warships outside Wusongkou. They were rushed to Shanghai on three transport ships, Jiangnan Maru, Jiaozhi Maru, and Zhujian Maru, and a Japanese warship escorted them to Shanghai. All of these soldiers landed in the Yangshupu area. When these Japanese troops arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, they marched in formation on Jungong Road, carrying a lot of military supplies. Many were transferred to the front and replaced the troops of the Shimomoto Brigade.</p>
<h3>Songhu Japanese Warships Avoid</h3>
<p>Outside of Wusongkou</p>
<p>After unloading the troops, many Japanese warships have left the area. Japanese warships in the Huangpu River also received orders from Nomura yesterday to temporarily leave Shanghai. It is estimated that two torpedo boats from the Second Fleet, one general destroyer from the Fifteenth Fleet, three destroyers from the Twenty-second Fleet, and one gunboat all sailed to various ports on the Yangtze River, so that the League of Nations committee team could not witness this, their intentions are extremely cunning.</p>
<h3>Unauthorized Opening of Songhu Train</h3>
<p>The Songhu Road is entirely within the sphere of influence of the Japanese army. After repairing the damaged tracks for the convenience of military transport, they began to run two steam passenger cars on the road yesterday afternoon, exclusively for the use of the Japanese army traveling between Songhu and Jiangwan, and Chinese people were not allowed to ride.</p>
<h3>British Minister Inspects Positions</h3>
<p>The Japanese army's occupied areas in Zhabei, Jiangwan, Dacha, Wusong, Liuhang, and other places, the British Minister Sir Miles Lampson, accompanied by the British, French, and American consuls in Shanghai, went to inspect. It is said that they were accompanied by Nomura and others to observe, in order to provide a basis for answering questions when the League of Nations Committee team consults.</p>
<h3>Ambo Returned Home Yesterday</h3>
<p>Admiral Ambo, the former Minister of the Navy, came to Shanghai to inspect the war zone and contacted Shirakawa, Ueda, and others about military affairs. Now that his mission has been completed, he left Shanghai yesterday on the Tatsuta warship to return home. The day before, Shirakawa and others saw him off on the Izumo flagship. Also, the imperial military attaché Outsu, sent by the Japanese Emperor as a frontline慰劳representative, was heard to have brought imperial crests awarded by the Japanese Emperor to Shirakawa, Ueda, and other officials. There were also tobacco and alcohol distributed to various officers and soldiers. For the 29 middle-ranking officers, including Major Hayashi Hachi and Major Osawa, who died in the Battle of Miaohang, were posthumously promoted in rank.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Run Commercial Services</h3>
<p>After the war, all Japanese ships in Shanghai were requisitioned for military use. Now that the League of Nations Investigation Team has arrived in Shanghai, in order to pretend to be at peace, the Japanese army released some of the requisitioned merchant ships and instructed the Nisshin and Nippon Yusen companies to start running the Yueyang Maru and Xiangyang Maru on the Yangtze River route from yesterday morning, one trip per week. Other ships such as Yiyang, Yunyang, Changyang, Dazhen, and Dafu continued to transport for the Japanese army. Also, the Sino-Japanese liner Shanghai Maru of Nippon Yusen was ordered to run a commercial service yesterday, but only a few Japanese residents boarded, and there were no goods loaded. In addition, there is no hope of recovery for coastal Japanese ships, but there is a lot of smuggling of Japanese goods from Shanghai to Tianjin. 5,000 bales of Toyo cotton yarn have been shipped.</p>
<p>Japanese People Exert Their Utmost</p>
<h3>Concealing the Tragic Situation in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Hoping to Deceive the Eyes and Ears of the League of Nations Team, the League of Nations Investigation Team arrived in Shanghai yesterday and will stay here for about a week, and will also inspect the war zones of Zhabei, Wusong, Jiangwan, etc. It is reported that the Japanese military authorities, hoping to conceal the eyes and ears of the team members, have ordered the garrison troops in Zhabei and other places to temporarily hide and withdraw in the past two days, and used traitors to hang the flag of the Republic of China on the roofs of important fortresses in various places to show that they have no ambition to occupy our land. Also, the barbed wire, crumbling walls, tiles, etc. at the small lane intersections on the border between the Northern District, Hongkou, and the Chinese areas were also cleared together. All the tragic scenes and corpses and remains left by the Japanese in Zhabei and Jiangwan were also buried and buried to the best of their ability, so that when the team members went to inspect, the traces of Japanese brutality could be reduced.</p>
<h3>Japan's Strong Attitude</h3>
<p>Preparing to Advance Both Peace and War</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, reported that, according to the army authorities, since the total retreat of the Chinese army, we have been eager to establish a state of truce. However, in view of the facts of the past, we have not yet understood the true intentions of the Chinese army, so the forces that have been deployed must still be dispatched to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Kobe Yushin Nippo reported that, according to the statement of Commander-in-Chief Shirakawa, from now on, our country (Japan) will follow the coordination of the countries and take measures to resolve the aftermath of the Shanghai Incident. However, within the period of unresolved issues, our army will still reorganize its troops and prepare for both peace and war.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported that the Chinese side at the Shanghai Round Table Conference took Japan's complete withdrawal of troops as a prerequisite, so the date of the meeting is still difficult to determine. We may not be able to hold the meeting due to the Chinese stubborn conditions. The military is mostly advocating that, with the exception of China, it will maintain the security of Shanghai and stipulate the security issues with other countries. However, Shanghai is a place where interests are intricately intertwined. It is questionable whether the countries concerned can agree to this important regulation. Otherwise, when we (Japan) encounter difficulties in realizing it, we should permanently station the necessary forces. On the one hand, we should sever diplomatic relations with the Chinese government. At present, the hard-line argument against China is gradually gaining strength.</p>

<p>Daidong Hotel</p>
<h3>Crackdown on a Reactionary Case</h3>
<p>Using the Name "Southeast Self-Defense Army"</p>
<p>Claiming "Resist Japan and Save the Nation" as Their Goal</p>
<p>Eleven Arrested, One Released</p>
<p>Verdict to be Determined After Investigation</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau received a report that some individuals, using rooms 29 and 34 of the Da Dong Hotel on Nanjing Road in the Public Concession, were organizing a "Southeast Self-Defense Army" with the aim of seizing the city's police authorities. Wen, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, dispatched detective Wu Xiufen to the Lao Zha police station on the afternoon of the 12th of this month to request assistance in making arrests. The head constable then dispatched Chinese constable Lin Kexun, Chinese detective Cui Jinchuan, and a Western detective to the hotel. In room 29, they apprehended Li Mingzhong, Li Xingwu, Li Zikuan (also known as Song Tuzhang), and Zhou Zishi. Subsequently, in room 34, they apprehended Zhou Hanchen, Yin Yuting, Wang Zhongren, Sun Yushu, and Zhang Mingyuan. In the two rooms, they also found a wooden counterfeit official seal bearing the inscription "Seal of the Commander of the First and Second Divisions of the Southeast Self-Defense Army," as well as a flag, ten letters of appointment, twenty-six armbands, four Shanghai maps, and numerous documents and letters. All items were taken back to the police station. After interrogation, they requested the French Concession police to dispatch detectives to the residences of Li Xingwu and Li Zikuan at 7 Route Saussure and 26 Route Massenet, respectively. They seized a box of documents at each location and apprehended two more accomplices, Song Botao and Cao Weixian, at 26 Route Massenet. Yesterday morning, all were sent to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Judge Song, along with Judges Zhao and Guo, convened a special second court session for interrogation. Chief Prosecutor Wang Zhennan also attended to perform his duties. Police lawyer Li Zhishan and defense lawyer Shen Yuesheng also appeared in court. In addition to dispatching detective Wu to the court with documents to request the transfer of custody, the Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent Sheng Zeqiu, the director of the Eighth District, and Jiang Shengtao, the captain of the First Squad, to testify. First, Lawyer Li presented an account of the case, stating that at 4:10 PM on the 12th, an informant from the Municipal Public Security Bureau reported to the Lao Zha police station that individuals were organizing the headquarters of the Second Brigade of the Second Division of the Southeast Self-Defense Army in a room at the Da Dong Hotel, with the intention of overthrowing the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He requested assistance in investigating the matter. The Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to the address and successively apprehended eleven offenders, seizing various pieces of evidence. He requested that they be interrogated and that the counterfeit official seal and other items be presented as evidence. Judge Song examined the evidence and then interrogated the defendants. Li Mingzhong confessed that he had come to Shanghai to seek employment. On the third day of the second month of the lunar calendar, he met Li Ao, the commander-in-chief of the Southeast Self-Defense Army, and asked Li for assistance. Li then told him of the plan and instructed him to open a room at the Da Dong Hotel, entrusting him with the task of receiving guests. He stated that the organization was founded just three or four days ago with the goal of resisting Japan and defending the nation. Li Xingwu stated that he was working as an inspector at a munitions factory. On the 12th, he went to the Da Dong Hotel to visit Zhang Mingyuan and was arrested in the process. He claimed to have no knowledge of this activity. Li Zikuan also stated that he worked in the document section of a munitions factory. On the 12th, he was invited by Zhang Mingyuan to the Da Dong Hotel to take a bath. In the room, Zhang introduced him to Li Mingzhong, and they discussed the matter of organizing a self-defense army, asking for his support, but he claimed he did not hold any position. Zhou Zishi stated that he was introduced to Li Mingzhong by Zhou Hanchen. He heard that the police brigade of the Municipal Public Security Bureau was also willing to become a self-defense army, and he was responsible for diplomatic activities, which had achieved considerable success. Zhou Hanchen stated that he was a regimental commander in the military during Yuan Shikai's administration and was a classmate of Zhang Mingyuan when they studied in Japan. He went to the Da Dong Hotel yesterday to visit Zhang and was arrested. Yin Yuting stated that he was recruited by Li Mingzhong to go to the hotel and was arrested as soon as he reached the door of room 29. Wang Zhongren stated that he is currently a military professor at Great China University and that he and Zhang Mingyuan are members of the self-defense army, which aims to resist Japan and save the nation, to avoid national demise at the hands of Japan. He stated that he strongly supports this organization and had previously visited the director of the Eighth District and Captain Jiang to discuss matters. He claimed that he had no other improper actions and requested a thorough investigation to clear his name. The testimonies of the other four defendants, including Sun Yushu, were largely similar. Finally, defense lawyer Shen Yuesheng and police lawyer engaged in a debate. The presiding judge stated that the case still required further investigation and that the Municipal Public Security Bureau's request for transfer of custody would be decided after the investigation was completed. However, Cao Weixian's involvement was considered to be relatively minor, and he was temporarily released on bail. The other ten defendants, including Li Mingzhong, were remanded in custody for further interrogation. The court adjourned, and it was already twelve o'clock.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Retains Wu Tiecheng</h3>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng recently telegraphed the Executive Yuan twice to resign. Yesterday, he received a telegram from Wang Jingwei to persuade him to stay. The original text is as follows: To Mayor Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai, I have respectfully received your two telegrams of Zhenyou and Zhenxu. Since you took office, you have been dealing with the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, and your efforts have been exhausting. Your colleagues here are deeply concerned. At this time of national crisis, we have no other meaning than sacrifice. I encourage myself with this and encourage you, my brother, with this. This is a special reply by telegram, and I respectfully ask you to adopt it. Your brother, Zhaoming.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the Concession Area</p>
<h3>The Garbage Problem in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Temporarily Handled by the Public Works Department</p>
<p>According to the "Continental News," the Public Works Department has reached an agreement with Mayor Wu and the commander of the Japanese naval landing forces regarding the garbage problem in the area of Zhabei adjacent to the concession. The Public Works Department will temporarily send people to handle it. It is reported that Mayor Wu sent a letter to the Japanese Consul General a few days ago regarding public security and sanitation in Zhabei, but has not yet received a reply. In view of the danger to the health of citizens, the Public Works Department decided to quickly find a way to negotiate with the Chinese and Japanese authorities to temporarily assist in the garbage disposal work. Last week, they sent someone to see Mayor Wu, urging him to find a way to handle the garbage disposal in Zhabei immediately, and informed him that the Public Concession had no intention of expanding the concession. They sincerely believed that sanitation in the war zone was necessary for the safety of the people of the city, so they were willing to go temporarily to handle it. It is reported that Mayor Wu also fully recognized the current status of Zhabei and its relationship with the concession. He did not reply to this proposal, but if it was beneficial to the citizens, he should not object. The Japanese authorities have already approved of this matter. It is reported that the Japanese concession authorities will go for a preliminary inspection this week to determine the scope of the area to be handled, and will start practical work tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Polish Minister Navarro Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the "Continental News," Polish Minister Navarro arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 13th) afternoon from Beiping and is currently staying at the Cathay Hotel. Mr. Navarro has not announced the reason for his arrival in Shanghai or the length of his stay.</p>
<h3>Request for Travel Expenses for National Labor Representatives</h3>
<p>Meeting to be Held in Geneva on April 12th</p>
<p>The 16th International Labor Conference is scheduled to be held in Geneva in mid-April of this year. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the China Industrial Federation received a telegram from the Ministry of Industry stating that the conference had decided to hold the meeting in Geneva on April 12th, and urged them to quickly appoint employer representatives and consultants. After receiving the telegram, the two associations stated that since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, most of the business leaders had left Shanghai, and they were unable to raise funds for travel expenses. They specifically requested the Ministry of Industry to allocate funds so that they could travel.</p>
<h3>US Troops Stationed in Beiping Will Pass Through Shanghai to Return Home</h3>
<p>According to the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," 90 US Marines will depart from Shanghai tomorrow on the USS Chaumont for Qinhuangdao, where they will transfer to the embassy compound in Beiping for a change of guard, so that the US troops whose terms have expired can return to the United States. The ship is scheduled to return to Shanghai from the north on the 22nd, and will set sail across the ocean the next day.</p>
<p>Hongqiao Road</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Airport</h3>
<p>Broken Walls and Rubble Everywhere</p>
<p>More Than Thirty Bomb Craters</p>
<p>The Hongqiao Road Airport in Western Shanghai has been subjected to random heavy bombing by large numbers of Japanese aircraft on the 21st and 28th of last month, turning factory buildings and offices into piles of rubble and affecting many civilian houses. Yesterday afternoon, this reporter made a special trip to inspect the scene. Upon arrival, I saw a number of foreigners and office staff from the British and French police stations also visiting the site, carrying cameras to take various films. There were more than thirty bomb craters of various sizes inside the airport, with the largest one in the northeast corner of the factory, measuring over a hundred steps in circumference and occupying more than one mu of good farmland. The bomb craters were filled with clear water, and their depths could not be discerned, forming a natural pond. Broken walls and debris were piled up, and machine parts and wood were scattered everywhere. Groups of ignorant villagers were stealing parts from the rubble. More than thirty civilian houses in Nanshen Lane across the river were also destroyed, creating a desolate scene resembling an ancient battlefield. Recalling the magnificent factory buildings being bombed by Japanese aircraft filled me with infinite sadness.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Luoyang Aviation to Begin Test Flights</h3>
<p>Yang Qing to Go to Beijing Today for Preparations</p>
<p>The Eurasian Aviation Corporation's Northwest Air Route has been actively underway since its trial flight last year and will soon be officially opened. The company has recently received an order from the Ministry of Communications to develop the Beijing-Luoyang route. The situation of the two routes is as follows:</p>
<h3>Northwest Route</h3>
<p>The Northwest Route was test-flown by Mr. Li Jingcong, the director of the operations group, last year, with excellent results. Active preparations were immediately made. The week before last, General Manager Qingfu and Mr. Li Jingcong, the director of the operations group, and Mr. Smith, the director of the flight group, went to Beiping together to plan the project. It is expected that the route will be officially opened in early next month. However, due to the unrest in Shanghai, Nanjing will be temporarily used as the starting point and Xinjiang as the end point. Although the journey is long, it can be reached in two days.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Luoyang Route</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications ordered the immediate preparation of the Beijing-Luoyang route. When General Manager Shuang went to Beiping, he made a detour to Luoyang and had discussions with the local authorities. This route starts from Beijing and ends in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. It is planned to set up stations along the way in Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and other places. Whether or not to set up a station in Kaifeng is currently undecided. This route was originally within the scope of the Northwest Route. Now, because the National Government has moved its capital, this section will be completed first. The company has now appointed Yang Qing, the director of the Shanghai station, to go to Beijing to oversee the implementation of the route. Director Yang is scheduled to go to Beijing today and conduct a test flight this week.</p>
<h3>Eurasian Aviation</h3>
<p>Although China and Russia have not yet resumed diplomatic relations, the Eurasian route involves crossing Russian territory, but this flight is commercial in nature and has no political implications. Therefore, Germany has already reached an agreement with Russia. Eurasian aviation will soon be realized. In the future, mail from Shanghai to Europe can be sent directly to Berlin, Germany in five days, and then distributed from Berlin, which is much faster than shipping to Vladivostok or transferring via the Siberian Railway.</p>
<p>Chinese Businesses</p>
<h3>Hua Shang Electric Company Loses 400,000</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, the Hua Shang Electric Company has suffered an intangible loss of approximately 400,000 in the electric light and streetcar divisions within the concession, due to two reasons: (1) Most of the residents within the concession have moved to the concessions and shops have been closed, resulting in the suspension of electric lights and no collection of fees; (2) In the streetcar division, streetcars are delayed in leaving the factory and enter the factory early, and there are very few passengers on the streetcars.</p>
<h3>Lecture by the German Women's Association</h3>
<p>▲Artistic Surgery</p>
<p>Dr. Engel, a German medical doctor, recently came to Shanghai from Europe to investigate medicine. Yesterday, he lectured at the German Women's Association on the artistic surgery of the human body, such as lifting sagging breasts and smoothing wrinkles on the forehead and corners of the eyes. In addition, thick legs and abdomens can also be treated with surgery. He showed many pictures, such as a 50-year-old woman looking like a 30-year-old woman after surgery. With the increasing development of women's careers, if a part of the body is deformed or not very beautiful, they are often despised in general society. Therefore, this kind of artistic surgery not only benefits the body and enhances beauty, but also has a great relationship with career, social life, and marriage.</p>
<p>Second Special Court</p>
<h3>Judicial Constable Shi Weiye Returns to His Country</h3>
<p>Mr. Shi Weiye (transliteration), a French judicial constable of the Second Special District Court of Jiangsu, Shanghai, recently asked the court president Ying Shi and the French Consul General for permission to take a leave of absence and return to his country with his family. He set sail on a French company's postal ship the day before yesterday. Chinese and Western staff of the court's judicial police department and Mr. Shi's relatives and friends all went to the company's wharf in Huangpu Beach to see him off. The vacancy left by Mr. Shi will be temporarily filled by Deputy Constable Mairgai (transliteration).</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Municipal Industrial Experiment Station</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the violent Japanese have been carrying out their cruel and vicious means, doing their best to bomb our cultural institutions and industrial factories, which have been almost completely destroyed. The weight of the losses is difficult to calculate. The essence of our Shanghai has been devastated by this catastrophe, and I am afraid that it will not be possible to restore it in a short period of time. However, the key to people's livelihood and future resistance and self-defense lies in the development of industry. Therefore, all manufacturers have summoned their remaining courage, risen up to plan, and strived to revive, discarding the old and adopting the new to catch up. Recently, they have been enthusiastically inquiring the Industrial Experiment Station about the design of new industries and entrusting them to research various technical issues. Based on its main purpose of assisting in the development of industry and commerce, the station accepts all inquiries sincerely and provides detailed answers. The station is located at Hehefang, Xiafei Road, French Concession. Although it is in the midst of the war, it still strives to carry out the entrusted experiments and research matters and continues to work.</p>
<h3>China Public School Holds Opening Ceremony</h3>

<h3>The Night Class of the Business School of National Central University Continues to Enroll Students</h3>

<h3>Jinan University is Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>Since National Jinan University announced its opening in Shanghai and recruited students from war zones, students from Guanghua, Jiaotong, Fudan, Daxia, Zhonggong, Tongji and other schools have flocked to the school to request to study or transfer. Because the original school at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Jiaozhou Road may not be sufficient for the large number of students, a large Western-style building has recently been rented at No. 64 Hede Road to serve as classrooms and offices. The curriculum of each college and department has also been announced recently. The professors hired are all well-known scholars from various universities in Shanghai. The school is scheduled to register on the 14th of this month and classes will begin on the 21st. Anyone wishing to study or transfer should register immediately at No. 32 Moliai Road.</p>
<h3>Qunyi Girls' School is Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>In view of the gradual calming of the war in Shanghai, the Qunyi Girls' School on Hainning Road in this city has determined that the faculty and staff have arrived at the school and that classes will begin on the 18th of this month.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Opening of the Sino-French Pharmacy Department</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, most schools in Shanghai have been suspended. Now that this city seems to be calmer, the school is of the opinion that the students have been out of school for too long, and it will be difficult to postpone the opening of classes again. A faculty meeting was specially convened, and it was decided to open classes on April 1, shorten the summer vacation to make up for the curriculum, and the students have been informed that they must bring their tuition fees to the school for classes before March 31. March 28 to March 31 is the period for paying fees and registering.</p>
<h3>Private Shanghai Middle School and Other Schools Intensify Coursework</h3>
<p>Private Shanghai Middle School, Shanghai Kindergarten Teachers College, Shanghai Primary School, and Shanghai Kindergarten, all located at Xipanyuan, Jiaozhou Road, Binlang Road, started classes yesterday. New and old students reported one after another. Most of the new students were transfer students from schools in the war zone. Principal Chen Jicheng, in view of the fact that students have missed many classes this semester, has increased the teaching time for major courses in order to make up for the classes and achieve practical results. It is reported that a re-examination will be held on March 20. Those with certificates from various schools may be exempted from the examination.</p>
<p>Comfort and Rescue</p>
<h3>German Consul's Family Enthusiastic About Rescue</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in the vicinity of Shanghai, a large number of our wounded soldiers have been sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. They have been carefully treated by the hospital's doctors. However, due to the increase in the number of patients in the hospital, the need for various items has also doubled in the past, and they often feel the pain of lacking materials. The wife of Mr. Feng Lide, the German Consul General in Shanghai, heard about this matter and took the lead in mobilizing the families of all the officers of the German Consulate General and other German women in this city to sew bed sheets and underwear for the wounded soldiers. A large number of them have been made and sent to the hospital for use.</p>
<h3>Employees of Jardine Matheson Donate Money</h3>
<p>The Chinese employees of various foreign banks in this city, in view of the loyalty and bravery of the 19th Route Army in resisting and defending themselves against the violence, have been enthusiastic about donating money to reward the troops. The Chinese employees of Jardine Matheson have followed suit, not wanting to lag behind. They have automatically decided to donate their salaries to help the military, starting in February until the end of the war, and remit them to the 19th Route Army every month, in order to collect the effect of gathering sand to form a pagoda. A total of 535 yuan and 7 jiao was collected in February and sent to the rear office of the 19th Route Army. A receipt was signed and returned.</p>
<h3>Chinese Constable Carries Fortune Oranges to Comfort the Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a Chinese constable No. 1166 carried two large baskets of fortune oranges to comfort the wounded soldiers of the 37th Hospital of the Red Cross. The constable said that the money for the oranges was saved from his usual savings, because he felt the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers of the 19th Army and the 5th Army in this battle, and he specially presented this small token of his sincerity. The wounded soldiers were all grateful after hearing this. The constable's enthusiasm is truly commendable.</p>
<h3>Report on the Red Cross's Front-Line Rescue Efforts</h3>
<p>The departure of the Chinese Red Cross rescue team to Suzhou to prepare for rescue matters has been reported in previous newspapers. Now, a report sent from the front is specially recorded as follows: When the team departed, they took the Taikoo Company's Wuhu Wheel to Zhenjiang. There were about 100 doctors and other personnel. The waiters on the Wuhu Wheel were willing to provide purely voluntary service and did not charge for alcohol, saving this amount for the subsidy of rescuing the wounded soldiers. After the team arrived in Zhenjiang, they started preparing a rear hospital and requested the support of Western doctors. However, there was a preparation for the National Disaster Relief Association in the area. The Western doctors thought that the goods were rare and demanded a monthly salary of 80 yuan to 200 yuan, otherwise they could not be effective. Therefore, the Red Cross had to stop and find other ways. The Jiangsu Provincial Government warmly welcomed the Red Cross rescue team and telegraphed various departments along the way to protect them properly. The team felt that the Zhenjiang society was indifferent to them, and the Western doctors in Shanghai were not enough to allocate, so they changed their policy and proceeded to Changzhou and Wuxi. The captain, Zhang Zhanyan, is probably already in Changzhou. In Suzhou, they have started working in Liuyuan and other places. Because there has been no contact for days, there are very few wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Western Clothing Industry Association</p>
<h3>Advocates Exempting Rent in Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Western Clothing Industry Association and the Sausage Industry Association have both suggested to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce that landlords be persuaded to voluntarily reduce rent by half to ease the burden on tenants, and that tenants pay another quarter of the original rent as a consolation to the wounded soldiers who defend the country and to relieve compatriots who have suffered. Deep sympathy was expressed, so a letter was sent to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce with supplementary suggestions, saying that the housing in the disaster area was destroyed by cannons and bombs, and those who directly suffered the pain were undoubtedly miserable, and those who survived unharmed and indirectly suffered the pain were also pitiful. According to this, within the disaster area, as landlords, they should have compassion and voluntarily exempt the rent. Then, the young and strong will not be displaced, and the old and weak will not fall into the ditches. Social security has a general impact. Furthermore, most of the landlords are capitalists, and the small sacrifices are not counted. The period of rent exemption for tenants will end when the market returns to its original state. The time is temporary and the losses are limited. If your association can lead the way, our association will follow. As the saying goes, "Many hands make light work, and it is difficult to accomplish alone." I dare to contribute my opinion. Whether it is feasible, I hope you will consider and check it carefully. If you can give me some guidance, I would be grateful.</p>
<h3>Gold Price Rises Sharply by Eight Taels</h3>
<p>Previous Business Hours Restore Original State</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold suddenly peaked, once exceeding 660 taels, and the situation was looking good. The market trading was very active. Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, business hours have been only one or two hours, but now they have been extended to the time stipulated by the exchange at 12 o'clock, restoring the old appearance. The intention in the industry is upward, and demand exceeds supply. The big silver price rose in the telegraphic report the day before yesterday, so the morning market was weak. After the foreign exchange was loose and flat, the buying sentiment of each firm soared, almost with a momentum of soaring a thousand, soaring by a huge 20 taels. However, there was a difference of more than 20 taels in half a day, which is a new record since the war. However, the market still stopped afterwards, and it will be possible to restore the original state only when the situation has a true hope of peace. From 9:30, the April opening price fell by five and a half taels to 646 taels. The big silver price continued to rise by one-eighth the day before yesterday, one-sixteenth for the long term, and HSBC's British gold price rose by one block, and the US dollar rose by 375 points, and it was sold by Hongkang Yong and others, continuing to fall by three taels, to 42 and a half taels. Afterwards, the internal market turned flat. May's British gold settled at 9 pence 875 points. HSBC bought spot US dollars at 33 yuan 1875 points. Then, Huabi bought May at 1875 points, and Zhongfu bought 125 points, so the price progressed all the way. In addition, Zhifeng Yong, Hengyu, Hengxingyuan, Yuan Maoyong, and Longsheng competed to buy, and Qian Changxiang, Futaiheng, Yuantai, and Yuhe were different in issuing and receiving, which greatly enlivened the market. It soared by more than ten taels, with only one or two taels of rotation, and reached 59 taels at 10:30. At this time, Dalian gangs and retail investors sold, and the long-term British gold was exchanged for 9 pence 875 points. Only three or four minutes later, it fell by more than three taels, to 55 taels and 5 qian. Zhifeng Yong and others came in, and the bank absorbed May's US dollars at 33 yuan and did spot transactions at 32 yuan 9375 points, and the price suddenly rose by more than six taels, to 60 taels and 8 qian at 10:30. Twenty minutes later, retail investors and bulls sold, and it lost four taels again, to 58 taels at 11:00. At this point, the market suddenly closed, but the firms did not withdraw, and after half an hour of preparation, they returned to the market to shout and trade. However, most of the buying and selling was a false show, and only Yifeng Yong and others slightly advanced, and the price was raised by more than five taels, and it suddenly went out of 60 taels. At 11:50, it reached 63 taels and 5 qian. The recent British gold settled at only 9 pence 9375 points, and the US dollar at 32 yuan 875 points. In short, the big players did not make large amounts of issues and receipts because the situation could not be greatly determined, so the price was unsustainable and retreated by more than five taels, to 58 taels. At noon, it closed at 59 and a half taels, which was eight taels higher than last Saturday. The maximum price in half a day was 63 taels and 5 qian, and the minimum price was 42 and a half taels, with a total of 21 taels of rotation. The quoted price was changed to 741 taels, with a discount of 95 to 98 taels. The discount at noon was 80 taels, which was 17 taels less than before. The recorded price was 59 taels, 60 taels, and 59 taels for water replenishment. There was no market for bare gold. The transactions of each firm were complicated, and the short sellers and hedgers generally entered.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Eases</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Monday, and as usual, there was no telegraphic exchange in the overseas silver market. However, the forward market continued to rise. The HSBC exchange rate was posted longer by one notch, with the British gold at 25, or one shilling, nine and a half pence, and the US dollar at 375, equivalent to thirty-two yuan, three jiao, seven fen, and five li. Adding 25 to Hong Kong, it totaled seventy-five taels and a half. Other exchange rates were also posted longer, with the Indian rupee at 118 rupees and 25 paisas, the French franc at 824 francs, the German mark at 136 marks and 25 pfennigs, the Dutch guilder at 80 and a half guilders, and the Singapore dollar at 129 taels and a half. It seems that actual transactions by banks are also trending towards easing. However, the result seems to be slightly moderated, with British gold up by 3.125 compared to last Saturday, and the US dollar up by only 0.0625, due to the continued decline in exchange rates the day before. Nevertheless, the bullion price rebounded from a low, once breaking through the 60 tael mark, which is still good. As for Chinese merchant transactions, they have been active, with most selling to hedge back into gold. It is estimated that about 450,000 pounds of British gold and 3-400,000 US dollars were traded. The Dalian merchants sold some, but the afternoon was calm due to the closure of the gold market.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Dips Below the Two-Fen Mark</h3>
<p>Due to commercial stagnation and sluggish demand for foreign funds in recent days, the foreign exchange rate has gradually declined. Yesterday, it even dipped below the two-fen mark. The morning market was at 7 qian, 1 fen, 9 li, 8 hao, 7 hu, and half a si. The afternoon market continued to fall by a little over one li, to 7 qian, 1 fen, 8 li, and a half. As a result, it fell by a total of two li compared to the afternoon market the day before, with the situation becoming increasingly weak.

Bank trading was 300,000 in the morning market and 135,000 in the afternoon market. The silver interbank lending rate remained at two qian and five fen for both markets, with overnight loans adding about one or two taels of interest. The bank posted rate was one qian, and the trading volume of interbank bills was over one million. Bank remittances totaled 3.5-3.6 million for foreign banks and over 2.1 million for Chinese banks. Money shops remitted over 2.9 million in foreign public bills and over 31 million in silver public bills. Transactions by small money shops amounted to over 300,000. The Jiangnan small foreign silver coin was at 6 qian, 3 fen, 3 li in the morning market, with a trading volume of 3,500 jiao. The price was the same in the afternoon market, with no transactions made. The Guangdong small foreign silver coin was at 6 qian, 3 fen, 5 li in the morning market and 6 qian, 3 fen, 3 li, 7 hao, and half a si in the afternoon market. The trading volume was 170,000 jiao in the morning market and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins rose again by 1,000 wen, to 406,000 wen. Clothing tokens were 2,923 wen in the morning market and 2,917 wen in the afternoon market. Coin blanks were 258 wen in the morning market and 257 wen in the afternoon market. The discount remained at 34 wen in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Rice Market in Southern Shanghai Falls by Two Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were over thirty sources of supply in the southern market. Transactions were small, with prices of various goods down by two or three jiao.

<h3>Rural Woman Accidentally Triggers a Hand Grenade and Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Li A'da, a villager from Huangnitang Village, located about six li west of Wusong Town, found his family's house right on the front lines between the two armies during the Japanese attack on Yunzaobang last month. Li hastily took his wife, Zhou (38 years old), and his son, A'mao (11 years old), and fled to the countryside of Xierpu Bridge in Yangxing Town to take refuge. The day before yesterday, Li learned that there was no more fighting in Wusong, so he led his wife and children home. Yesterday at around 7:30 p.m., A'mao was playing alone in a nearby field when he picked up a hand grenade. He brought it home. Li, seeing it, did not know it was dangerous because one end of the grenade was shaped like an iron pillar, and the other end had a round wooden handle, so he thought it was an iron pestle. At that time, Zhou was carrying a wooden bucket to fetch water from a small river in front of her house. Because the weather was cold and the river water was frozen, she took the hand grenade to break the ice. Unexpectedly, the hand grenade exploded immediately upon touching the ice. Li heard a loud bang in the house and was shocked to go out and see, but Zhou had already collapsed by the river in a pool of blood. The scene was very tragic. After reporting, neighbors found an empty coffin in a nearby field, carried it to Li's house, and placed Zhou's body in it.</p>

<h3>Zhao Daiwen Succeeds as Chairman</h3>

<p>Our Country Notifies the League of Nations</p>
<h3>Accepting the Assembly's Proposal</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reliable sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our country's representative Yan has formally notified the Assembly of the League of Nations that China accepts the resolution of the Assembly on March 11. It is also believed that the principles that China requested the Assembly to acknowledge have all been included in the resolution, expressing gratitude. Special mention was also made of the three most important points in the resolution: (1) The settlement of disputes between China and Japan must not be under military pressure; (2) All member states have the obligation to submit disputes to peaceful resolution. China has already used this procedure, so it is naturally not responsible for the current situation; (3) The member states will not recognize the situation created by violations of the Covenant and the Pact of Paris, as well as the treaties concluded, which of course includes puppet governments.

<h3>Talks by Various Central Committee Members</h3>

<h3>Resolved Not to Shirk Responsibility</h3>
<p>Denying the Rumor of Dai Jitao Going to Japan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Last night, a Reuters reporter visited Chiang Kai-shek at Zhongshan Park. Chiang was having dinner with his wife. The reporter was summoned into the dining room. Chiang was wearing a blue robe, looking very healthy. He smiled and asked, saying that he had decided to accept the position of Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and take full military responsibility. He has never shirked responsibility. The Chinese army in Shanghai has received considerable assistance, and the outside rumors are not credible. China is willing to resolve the disputes peacefully, but if Japan does not stop its acts of aggression, China is prepared to fight to the end. When the reporter asked his opinion on the resolution passed by the League of Nations Assembly, Chiang replied that since Japan has expressed its willingness to abide by this resolution, the resolution seems more promising. When the reporter asked his impression of the rumor from Tokyo that the Ministry of the Army intends to withdraw the 9th Division and a mixed brigade from Shanghai and lift the mobilization of the 3rd Fleet, Chiang smiled and replied that the news from Tokyo cannot be deeply trusted. Although there is talk of troop withdrawal, reinforcements are actually arriving one after another. All the talk of troop withdrawal is only because the League of Nations Commission of Inquiry is coming to Shanghai. The Japanese side's talk of troop withdrawal is not sincere. In reality, the Japanese side is preparing for military action. If the Japanese army implements a surprise attack, the Chinese army is determined to resist forcefully, and the responsibility will be on the Japanese side. This is very clear, because the Chinese army is purely on the defensive, while the Japanese army is on the offensive. Where the responsibility lies, the world will easily know. There is no war on the front lines at present. The Japanese side's claim that the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army on Friday is ridiculous. Chiang firmly denied that Dai Jitao would go to Japan. Chiang showed the reporter a telegram from Dai, in which he stated that the rumor of going to Japan was inaccurate. Chiang further told the reporter, "When you go back, please tell everyone that this statement has no basis. Now is not the time to send someone to Japan." When the reporter asked about the government's policy towards the three northeastern provinces, Chiang said that the government is still considering this matter carefully. The claim that the government has decided to send troops to suppress it is not true, because the problem of the three northeastern provinces must be resolved by the League of Nations after the League of Nations Commission of Inquiry investigates it. When the reporter asked when he would take office as Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Chiang replied that it has not yet been decided, but it is not far off. When the reporter was talking with Chiang in the dining room, the living room was full of distinguished guests, and Minister Chen Mingshu was also among them. It is said that in addition to taking the position of Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Chiang will also concurrently serve as Chief of Staff. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shenyang is in Chaotic Order</h3>
<p>Guerrillas and Japanese Troops Engage in Fierce Fighting</p>

The 11th and 5th sub-bureaus of the Public Security Bureau of Beiguan were completely disarmed. Four Chinese policemen and seven Japanese gendarmes were killed, and several were injured. Ten Japanese planes flew in on the morning of the 10th to scatter slogans celebrating the establishment of the puppet state, including "Long Live," "Long Live the State of Manchuria," and more than ten other kinds. All the police in the city wore yellow cloth bags with red characters such as "Fengtian City Founding Celebration Conference." The city was in chaotic order that day, and businesses closed down. (14th Special Dispatch) (Beiping) Shenyang News, On the morning of the 10th, the guerrillas attacked the Japanese station and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army. The sound of gunfire continued all day. The Japanese side suffered extremely heavy losses. All the shops in the city were closed. At the same time, fires broke out in Dananguan and Dabeimen.

<p>Former Chinese Eastern Railway Employees</p>
<h3>Band Together to Demand Back Pay</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Former employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway banded together to demand back pay from the Chinese Director-General and the Russian Deputy Director-General. Due to the large number of people, a three-person dialogue was held, but after a long argument, no results were achieved. The Chinese Premier later promised to hand the matter over to the board of directors for resolution. (14th Reuters Dispatch) (Harbin) The Japanese newspapers are now paying close attention to the activities of the Soviet Russian administrators of the Chinese Eastern Railway. According to the Sino-Russian agreement, the employees of the Sino-Russian Railway should be half Chinese and half Russian. According to statistics on January 1 of this year, there were 4,690 Russian employees on the railway, while there were only 3,832 Chinese employees. According to the local newspapers, the South Manchurian Railway is now planning to send a team to Da Heihe to explore the gold mines. According to experts, the area is famous for its gold production, but before large-scale mining can be carried out to make a profit, it is necessary to suppress the bandits in the area and build railways or highways. The industry is welcome, but the question of who should have the right to mine the Mudan Tauber (phonetic) gold mine is of particular concern to the mining industry. According to Russian experts, the area is the richest in gold mines in northern Manchuria. Several companies have tried to obtain this right, even willing to pay 50% of the surplus to the former government, but they have not succeeded. The public thinks that the Mudan Tauber gold mining area has long been coveted by officials of the old Jilin government, and they did not dare to let it go easily, so no governor has the power to grant the right to this mineral to any company. Since the Japanese troops arrived in Harbin, the Russian immigrant associations in the area and in Shenyang have decided to organize a new group to protect and expand the interests of Russian immigrants in Manchuria and Mongolia. Many people support it, but most are unwilling to participate, because several of the people who initiated the group and were elected as directors are not qualified for the job.

<p>(Harbin) According to the local newspapers, Russians doing business here will henceforth have to pay a business license fee ranging from 250 yuan to 750 yuan, depending on the amount of their business.

It is said that he was ordered to come here to eliminate the employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and about 500 people, including many engineers in key positions, may be affected. These people are very cold to the Soviet Union. If they are ordered to return to their country, they will not obey. It is said that they are now planning to fire them and replace them with reliable young people newly arrived from Russia. In recent days, the post office here has received and delivered a large number of anti-Japanese newspapers and leaflets. The Japanese authorities are very concerned about this matter.

<h3>The US and China Should Restore Diplomatic Relations with Russia Urgently</h3>

<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Moscow, 14th – This morning, Soviet Russian newspapers prominently featured an interview between Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov and American journalists in Geneva. It is said that Litvinov claimed that the deplorable events in the Far East today are largely due to the lack of relations among the thirty Pacific nations, Soviet Russia, China, and the United States. If diplomatic relations had existed among the three countries earlier, he firmly believes that such a situation would not have occurred, nor would such events have been encountered.</p>

<h3>German Presidential Election</h3>
<p>Hindenburg Wins Majority of Votes but Not Enough to Meet Legal Requirement</p>
<p>Run-off Election to be Held on April 10th Expected to Secure Victory</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 13th – The results of the preliminary German presidential election show that Hindenburg fell one percent short of the required votes to be elected, but he defeated other candidates. Therefore, Hindenburg is certain to be elected in the run-off election on April 10th. According to German election law, the preliminary election must yield an absolute majority of votes to be elected; if a run-off election is held, only a relative majority is required. In terms of votes, Hindenburg received the most votes. According to the official final report, excluding some remote areas, Hindenburg received 18,661,736 votes, Hitler received 11,338,571 votes, Thälmann received 4,982,079 votes, Duesterberg received 2,557,876 votes, and Winter received 111,452 votes. Hindenburg received many votes in the cities, especially in the Rhineland. Hitler had a slight advantage in the townships, but the Communist Thälmann was unable to stand out anywhere. It is heard that the sons of the former German emperor all voted for the leader of the National Socialist Party, Hitler. Although the public was very restless during the voting, and there were concerns about riots, there were no serious disturbances, only minor clashes between political parties in various places. A plane supporting Hitler crashed outside Berlin, scattering leaflets. Both people on board were injured, but fortunately not seriously. Hindenburg is a Protestant, while Hitler is a Catholic, but tens of thousands of Catholics prayed all night for Hindenburg's victory. In an ancient church outside Cologne, thousands of Catholics knelt for three hours in the cold to pray for Hindenburg. Special Masses were held in the cathedral at 2:00-3:00 AM, attended by 20,000 people. Female voters were exceptionally enthusiastic. As soon as the polling stations opened, women rushed to vote. It is believed that most women voted for Hindenburg. One nun, aged 84, refused to give up her right to vote. Another sick woman ignored the advice of her husband and doctor and insisted on getting out of bed to vote, claiming, "How can I lie in bed and let Hitler seize power?" The eagerness of women to vote is evident in this. It is estimated that 90% of eligible female voters voted. On average, about 83% of the country voted. Only about 17% of eligible voters nationwide did not vote. In hospitals in Berlin, patients could fill out ballots in bed. There were 64,000 polling stations across the country. After voting closed at 6:00 PM, thousands of officials began counting the ballots. Once the results were obtained, they were telegraphed to Berlin. Although the National Socialist Party did not receive the most votes, it has made great progress compared to the 1930 election.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 14th – The results of the first German election are sufficient to guarantee that Hindenburg will be elected in the second round. The international community is generally satisfied with this. The French newspapers were particularly pleased to hear that Hitler was 7 million votes short of the required number of votes for election. Le Journal stated that the whole world will gladly welcome the results of the first German presidential election, because it is no longer a question that the candidate of the National People's Party will not be elected. Otherwise, if he were to seize power one day, it would cause domestic turmoil and new international disputes. Le Matin said that Hindenburg's great victory was half due to Brüning's strong support and half due to the political wisdom of the socialists, who, seeing the seriousness of the situation, unanimously supported Hindenburg. The British newspapers also expressed similar satisfaction and pleasure, believing that once Hitler came to power, it would plunge Europe into a new era of disputes.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Large Loans to Japan by Deceased Match King</h3>
<p>Swedish Government Approves Suspension of Payments in Cash</p>
<p>European and American Finances Will Be Severely Affected</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, London, 13th – It is widely rumored here that Kreuger, the Swedish match king, through his Kreuger &amp; Toll company, recently loaned a huge amount of money to Japan. Although this rumor has not yet been confirmed, many key figures in the London financial world believe it.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Stockholm, 13th – The Swedish Parliament today passed a law suspending cash payments. The passage of this law is for the purpose of rescuing the economic situation and because smaller creditor companies panicked after the suicide of Kreuger, the head of the Kreuger Match Company. Therefore, it was necessary to take precautions. The Swedish government's administrative council convened a special meeting at 2:00 PM to approve the suspension of cash payments and limited the suspension to the end of March. At the same time, there are plans to remedy the situation for Kreuger's company and other smaller companies affiliated with Kreuger's company. ▲Reuters, London, 14th – Kreuger, the Swedish match king, is one of the directors of the British Match Corporation, but according to the company's director, Mr. Snelling, the British company is not affected by Kreuger's financial measures. Stockholm is currently maintaining calm. Although the stock exchange is currently closed for business, banks and commercial firms will operate as usual tomorrow. Both houses of the Swedish Parliament met at 12:00 last night and passed a bill to suspend cash payments by private companies. This bill allows the companies operated by Kreuger to consolidate their finances. The impact of the Swedish match king's suicide on French finances is not yet known, but shares in the Swedish Match Company have been bought a lot in the French market, and another batch of shares worth 30,000 francs will be sold tomorrow. It is believed that the financial impact on the United States and Germany will be greater than on any other country.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Stockholm, 12th – Kreuger Match Company Director Frant collapsed after hearing the news of match king Kreuger's suicide. At that time, there were rumors that he had passed away, but he soon regained consciousness, but his condition is extremely critical tonight. Mr. Frant has been ill for several months, and the sudden news aggravated his condition.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Stockholm, 13th – The newspapers have confirmed the rumors that Mr. Kreuger's finances were extremely difficult. The Scandinavian Bank had re-discounted various securities worth 120 million Swedish krona, with Kreuger's personal guarantee, to the Swedish National Bank. The deadline was the end of March this year. Although Mr. Kreuger tried his best to raise funds, he was unable to do so in the end. In this situation, the act of delaying repayment was inevitable. Mr. Kreuger's sudden death only accelerated its realization.</p>

In this situation, a celebration for the establishment of the puppet state was held on the 9th of this month. The event was organized by the municipal government and cost 200,000, all borne by the merchants. They endured the pain and paid their shares without complaint. The director of the municipal government, Bao Guancheng, from Zhejiang, has served as Toihara's secretary for years. He has forgotten his origins and no longer considers himself Chinese. He is the most egregious in acting as a tool of the enemy. All the abnormal behaviors and pro-Japanese and traitorous acts in Harbin are directed by Bao. The celebration of the puppet state is one example. The towns along the Eastern Railway were also ordered by Bao to hold celebrations organized by the local municipal branches. In Manzhouli, the 2nd Brigade of Su Bingwen's troops strongly opposed holding this event, saying that if the traitorous celebration was held, the garrison would take action against the organizers. The municipal government therefore suspended the event, which shows that the hearts of the soldiers are not yet dead.</p>
<p>On the 26th of last month, the command of the 3rd Brigade of the Japanese army stationed in Harbin sent personnel to the post office to detain newspapers from Tianjin and Shanghai. All newspapers sent from the mainland, large and small, were detained. Therefore, people in Harbin have no newspapers to read. This action was taken because some ignorant news vendors sold newspapers from Tianjin and Shanghai in Harbin, selling each copy for four or five jiao, hawking them on the streets. Japanese soldiers bought them one after another, secretly reading news of the war in Shanghai. The Japanese army command believed this was shaking military morale and could cause the Chinese in Harbin to have rebellious thoughts. Therefore, they sent personnel to detain the newspapers. News from Shanghai can only be obtained by a few households with radios, who secretly listen to the Nanjing broadcasts every night. Most newspapers in Harbin have stopped publication since the Japanese army entered. The Harbin Gazette has also been opposed by the Japanese side and recently suspended publication. It is said that it will soon be taken over by the Japanese side, who will use its name to publish a Chinese-language foreign newspaper. In addition, the Dong San Sheng Commercial Daily and Binjiang Times have made various efforts to resume publication, but few people buy them because there is no real news to read. The International Concord Daily was banned by the authorities for opposing the Japanese side some years ago. Recently, its editor, Zhang Fusheng, unable to bear the economic pressure, defected to the Japanese and plans to resume publication on the 10th of this month. The name remains the same, but in reality, it is also a Chinese-language foreign newspaper. Patriotic journalists have all withdrawn. This is the state of decline in the Harbin newspaper industry. In military terms, three trains of Japanese soldiers departed on the 3rd of this month and arrived in Yimianpo early on the 4th. The Binben Detachment was stationed there. One train remained to guard the area, and the other two continued to advance. Early on the 5th, one train arrived at the Hailin station on the Hasui Line and planned to continue forward. However, it was discovered that a section of the railway between Hengdaohezi and Gaolingzi had been destroyed by Wang Delin's National Salvation Army, so the advance was halted. A cavalry unit of about 600 men was sent to Ningguta to strike the rear of the National Salvation Army near Jilin City. Three airplanes accompanied them. It is reported that they have already made contact with Wang Delin's army. Details are not yet known. The Japanese side has requested Xi Qia and Zhang Jinghui to demarcate more than 200 mu of land in Hailin and Ningguta respectively to build two airfields for military convenience. The three Japanese planes sent east have recently been formed into an independent air squadron to eliminate Wang Delin's National Salvation Army. The Self-Defense Army in Zhuhe was originally taking the initiative to contact the National Salvation Army, but due to a lack of ammunition, it withdrew to Yanshou on the morning of the 4th. Therefore, for strategic reasons, a part of the National Salvation Army has retreated towards the Suifenhe area.</p>
<p>The most tense situation between China and Russia is the White Russian restoration movement. Semenov, under the control of the Japanese side, wants to lead his old troops to establish a state in the Transbaikal and Manzhouli border areas. He is actively recruiting volunteers in Liaoning, with a total of 20 battalions, each with 300 men. The Japanese side is providing weapons. They plan to launch an attack on the Suifenhe border to divert the attention of the Russian army outside the Manchurian border, and then seize the Transbaikal Province. Therefore, the Soviet Union has increased troops on the border, seriously preparing for war. After the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo, the White Russian state-building plan can be gradually implemented.</p>
<p>Xi Qia is currently complacent. As the first meritorious official of the puppet state and a traitor trusted by the Japanese, his influence has greatly increased, and he intends to expand his power. Xi has already taken on the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Railway Protection Army and appointed Shen Cheng as Deputy Commander, Shang Zhi as Chief of Staff, and Wu Runlin as Secretary-General. A commander was appointed for the Harbin-Changchun Line, with Jin Bidong concurrently serving. The headquarters is located in Changchun. A commander was also appointed for the Harbin-Suifenhe Line, with Liu Yushu, the commander of the First Brigade, concurrently serving. The troops are completely concentrated along the Eastern Railway to prevent a counterattack by the Self-Defense Army. Xi also sent Luan Yunkui to serve as the commander of the Jilin-Heilongjiang Coastal Defense Navy Fleet. However, Zhang Jinghui also sent someone to take over, resulting in unresolved competition. Later, the Japanese side decided that after the establishment of the puppet state, it would be assigned and governed. Zhang Houhuan, the chief of the Railway Police, refused to serve the enemy and has abandoned his post and fled to Beiping. Xi is planning to appoint Qi Zhizheng, the deputy chief of the Special Police Department, to take over. Zhang Jinghui is planning to appoint Yu Jingtao, the deputy chief of the department, to act as an agent. This vacancy has also been disputed for several days, but it has not been resolved yet.

<h3>New Situation Between China and Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul Sends Informal Letter to Garrison Command</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese in Hankou have maintained a provocative attitude. More than a dozen warships were anchored on the river. Their commander, Shiozawa, once made the wild statement that he could completely occupy Wuhan within 24 hours. The Japanese consulate also made demands on our side to suppress anti-Japanese activities. After the Shanghai War broke out and the Japanese army suffered losses, they urgently took measures to ease the anti-Japanese sentiment of our people. However, after the 19th Route Army retreated to the second defense line, the Japanese became arrogant again and harbored evil thoughts. The Japanese consulate recently sent an informal letter to Xia Doushi, the commander of the Wuhan garrison. The main points of the letter were: 1) The anti-Japanese sentiment of the people of Wuhan is guided by the Kuomintang branch; 2) There are oil paintings hanging in the city that slander the Japanese and insult Chinese women. It stated that if misunderstandings arise as a result, the Japanese army will take free action, and your commander will be fully responsible. The letter was not officially stamped, and seemed more like a private communication, but its intention to intimidate was obvious. After receiving the letter, the garrison command immediately responded reasonably. Regarding the first point, it stated that the anti-Japanese sentiment was spontaneous from the people and the Kuomintang branch did not participate. Regarding the second point, it thoroughly investigated the city and found no such paintings. It also promised to protect the Japanese according to the law. The two letters have not yet been made public, or perhaps the garrison command does not regard them as official documents. However, these two letters have caused various rumors in the city. Ye Peng, the chief of staff of the garrison command, has repeatedly stated that no matter what, he will ensure that the security of Wuhan remains as strong as ever, and that anyone who creates rumors will be arrested.

<h3>Shi Zhaoji's Illness</h3>
<p>▲ Doctors Say He Needs Long-Term Rest</p>
<p>Reuters reported from London on February 20th, that Shi Zhaoji, the Chinese ambassador to London, is still ill in Malaga, Spain. It is said that his condition has not improved. Ambassador Shi arrived in Malaga on January 25th from Southampton. In the first two weeks, his physical strength gradually improved. Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, his old illness has relapsed three times. Not only has he lost all the initial benefits, but he is also not as well as he was in London. There is still a possibility of further deterioration. He is currently being treated by a Spanish neurologist who studied in London and Berlin. According to his diagnosis on February 22nd, Ambassador Shi is physically weak due to overwork. To fully recover, he must rest his mind and body and stay away from the duties that caused the illness for a long time. Therefore, he is advised to move to a place with a mild climate and take a long-term rest. According to the doctor's opinion, even after a full recovery, Ambassador Shi will not be able to handle strenuous work, otherwise the illness will recur soon. Ambassador Shi is nearly sixty years old, and if the illness recurs, there is no hope of recovery. Therefore, in any case, Ambassador Shi cannot return to London or Geneva to resume his old duties. This diagnosis is almost identical to what his medical consultant in Paris said. Ambassador Shi has made outstanding contributions to recent League of Nations conferences and has a very good reputation in London. Many people in London are happy to associate with him. If he leaves his post due to illness, the British Foreign Office will feel sorry. Since Ambassador Shi arrived in London, the Chinese Embassy has been completely renewed. It is said that he has spent a lot of money out of his own pocket. Furthermore, in these difficult times for the country, it is not easy to fulfill his mission abroad. It is deeply hoped that after a long period of rest, his physical strength will recover, and he will be able to take on lighter work in a suitable climate, so that in times of need, he can still serve the country if the work does not require prolonged labor.</p>
