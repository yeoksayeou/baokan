<h3 id="c1">募集興國公債彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>一昨吾人已建議募集禦侮公債矣。今請更建議募集興國公債。試取日本之明治維新爲喻。</p>
<p>明治維新。其兩個中心口號爲「攘夷」爲「開國」攘夷即禦侮。開國即建設。二者並重。故得以收維新之大效。處於今日强權橫行公理不彰之時代一民族而外不能禦侮。内不能建設者此民族必亡。或受一時感情之衝動。賭國脈民命以抗禦强暴。而不能作持久之計劃。準備持久之奮鬥者。此民族亦必亡。惟能以堅固之團結。拚死以抗。外敵之侵凌。而又有久遠建國之計劃者夫然後此民族乃能爭取生存自由。寖以臻於興盛。</p>
<p>我國今日必須竭盡全力以抗禦暴日之侵略。蓋已無可懷疑之餘地。有借口國家財政無辦法而主張暫時忍辱負重者。此懦夫之論也。質之事實。我國財政。未始遂無辦法。徒以過去有財無政。旣無預算。亦無决算。公私迄不分明。更藉口財政困迫。多方榨取於民。殺鵝取蛋。亦所不惜。一面旣竭人民之血汗。以用之於軍備軍費與助長内亂。而另一面復不予人民以生產之機會。民貧則國安得不貧。國民經濟枯竭。國家財政。固安得而不破產。故我國非患無財特患無政。而將財用之於不生產背乎經濟原則之途耳。</p>
<p>吾人以爲今日爲抗禦暴日計。固亟應發行禦侮公債二萬萬元而爲持久奮鬥。新生我民族。奠定我國基計。則又亟應發行興國公債以開發内地。蓋我國處於今日情勢之下。非開發内地。發展農村經濟。仍不足以持久。而以我國之地大物博。即開發數省。亦已足抗暴日而有餘也</p>
<p>興國公債。亦假定爲二萬萬元。專用之於開發西北與西南。絶對不准移作内戰之用由人民團體組設委員會監督政府。公共設計支配。聘用外國專門人材。利用其技術。積極努力於㈠便利交通。㈡興復農業。增加農產。㈢籌設基本工業。㈣扶植内地現已瀕於破產之企業。最低限度使衣食均能自給。夫然後能與暴日作持久之抗爭。</p>
<p>吾人認爲東南富庶區域中才智之士。在今日應亦勿再迷信蘇杭爲安樂之天堂。或再抱國即亡而我仍可往外國爲便便大腹富翁之夢想。視此次日軍之橫暴。即可知在最近時間東南沿海一帶。我國内决無一片樂土。故今後亟應往内地去。輸財盡力。集中力量以開發内地。内地開發。國基鞏固。民皆福利。己乃得安。否則板蕩陸。沉惟有大家同歸於盡耳。國亡家破。己又將安適耶。上海事件</p>

<p>敵軍換防被我軍砲轟</p>
<p>敵機擲彈被我軍擊退</p>
<p>閘北方面、昨日自晨至晚、因日方正將新到陸軍補充換防、故無激烈戰爭、惟敵軍誠恐我軍進攻、不時以大砲或機槍向我方射擊、而我軍當敵之生力軍換防時、曾用小鋼砲轟擊、曾擊中竇樂安路敵軍水兵隊、死傷水兵甚多、此外敵軍又遣飛機至我陣地擲彈、當被我軍用高射砲擊退、茲將昨日情形分紀如下、</p>

<p>日本顯然首先破壞休戰協定</p>
<p>但報告書中並未斷定其責任</p>
<p>日内瓦上海領事調查團、係由意大利代辦及法國挪威英國德國西班牙各總領事組織成之、並與美國總領事合作、其第二次報告書、又於本月十二日發出、其文如下、</p>
<p>正月二十九日午後八時許、即休戰業已開始之後、槍砲之聲、爲之靜寂、翌日日本海軍司令乃向美英兩國總領事提出抗議、謂停在北站之鐵甲車重行開火、此層經華人否認、並謂日本有射擊情事、　　正月三十一日晨間日本飛機十七架、在上海並在華軍防地飛行、但未轟擊、日本海軍當局謂、因華人近頃破壞休戰條件、乃以此項示威運動出之、但破壞休戰條件一層、經華人鄭重否認、是日各方會商設立中立區域並决定繼續休戰、以待雙方答覆、此種談、判本團業於第一次報告書末段提及之、</p>
<p>二月一日休戰之事殆已實行、但若干槍聲時作時輟、</p>
<p>二月二日日軍司令又謂華人昨日重行破壞休戰條件、並謂華人顯然集合軍隊、預備包圍日軍、渠遣派飛機前往偵查、是日正午十二鐘左右、有日本飛機數架、飛翔上海及中國軍隊防地、中國人對之射擊、日本飛機在閘北擲彈數枚、頃刻之間、雙方戰線上槍聲大作、至下午三時、即戰事重開以後、日本總領事通告各國領事、謂前所提議之中立區域、日本政府已經拒絶、</p>
<p>同日上海市長照會各國領事提及一月三十一日開會時所訂之休戰協定謂日本人屢次破壞此項協定並攻擊中國軍隊又復以飛機轟擊（其情形即如上節所述）此項照會各國領事係於上月三日收到</p>
<p>二月三日日本海軍當局宣稱、中國當局、對於履行諾言、繼續表示無誠意、故中國軍隊應令退出閘北以外至相當距離點、日本方面、因欲執行此項計畫、其飛機或有轟炸中國陣線之事、厥後日本總領事通知各國領事、謂有驅逐艦三、艘因受吳淞砲台之砲擊、故日本人决定占領該砲台、但吳淞砲台發砲之事、又爲中國方面所否認、自二月三日以後、戰爭狀態、公然存在、即與休戰相似之情况、亦完全消滅、閘北及吳淞方面繼續開砲、時作時輟、而日本方面又以飛機轟炸、日本人自認其目的在奪取吳淞砲台、並驅逐中國軍隊於距離上海甚遠之處、故採取攻勢、完全係日本人所爲、</p>
<p>關於破壞休戰條件一層、所應注意者、即實際上完全休戰狀態、迄未成立、而火線上並無外國觀察員在塲、究竟破壞之責、應由何方負擔、實無法加以判斷或者雙方孤立隊伍、或滋事份子、均應負責、亦未可知、</p>
<p>除戰線上正式軍隊重行開火之問題以外、在此時期以内、公共租界日本所管地段、曾發生若干事件、有關公共租界之制度、而在國際上有重要關係、必須簡單加以叙述、</p>
<p>自一月二十八日夜間、日本人採取行動之始、即有多數着便衣之中國士兵、侵入日本地段或藏匿民房、或攀登屋頂、而以手槍向街上日本步哨射擊是時日本人似無充分正式軍隊、以防守其所佔地段、乃召集所謂在鄉軍人畀以槍械、此項軍人亦着便服、但帶有臂章、日本水兵及在鄉軍人、以械關槍抵抗中國便衣隊、並挨户搜查、搜查之時發生極大損害、蓋以此輩因欲驅逐便衣隊、不惜縱火焚燒民房故也、是時虹口地段完全在日本海軍當局管轄之下、該處若干街道旣已設置障碍物、而巡捕武裝亦被解除致公共租界市政職務、併消防事務在内爲之停頓、虹口各處巡捕房與總巡捕房之間交通亦完全斷絶、工部局乃不得不將學校病院遷出日本水兵及在鄉軍人、曁其他暴虐之徒多有過分之舉、甚至以簡單手續、執行槍决、日本暴虐之徒、並無正式職務、其行動大約因中國人前此作有反日活動、乃以報復手段出之、結果發生恐怖現象、凡日本人以外之居民、幾皆逃避一空、有極多中國人查無下落、疑爲日本人所捕殺、</p>
<p>二月五日、公共租界工部局請領事團轉商日本當局、對於此事加以調查、經日本總領事承認在混亂之際、日本人感情熱烈、誠有過分舉動、但情形業已大加改善、並允將公共租界以内、凡因嫌疑而被日本海軍當局逮捕之人、移交工部局巡捕房、此層業已實行、然失踪華人、爲數仍甚多、據工部局巡捕房、詳細調查、失踪之案、尙有三百起之譜、便衣隊之行動、頃已大爲減少、而日本之監察則仍森嚴、工部局巡捕及其他市政職務、僅能徐徐恢復、日本當局因日本人過分行爲、甚爲感動、已將若干不良份子遣送回國、本團暫時不擬另提報告書、但如覓得新消息、須將上次報告書加以改正、或將第一第二次報告書所載特殊之點、加以伸引、或加以補充、則當别論、（十五日哈瓦斯、社電）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fundraising for National Revival Bonds <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, we suggested raising national defense bonds. Today, we further propose raising national revival bonds. Let us take Japan's Meiji Restoration as an example.</p>
<p>The Meiji Restoration had two central slogans: "Expel the Barbarians" and "Open the Country." "Expel the Barbarians" means defending against aggression, and "Open the Country" means building up the nation. Both were equally important, thus achieving the great effect of the Restoration. In today's era of rampant power and obscured justice, a nation that cannot defend against aggression from without and cannot build itself up from within is bound to perish. Or, if a nation is moved by temporary emotions and gambles its national destiny and its people's lives to resist tyranny, but fails to make lasting plans and prepare for sustained struggle, that nation will also perish. Only when a nation can resist foreign invasion with firm unity and fight to the death, and also has long-term plans for national construction, can that nation then strive for survival and freedom, and gradually achieve prosperity.</p>
<p>There is no room for doubt that our country must exert all its strength today to resist the aggression of the violent Japanese. Those who use the excuse of the nation's financial difficulties to advocate temporary humiliation and bearing a heavy burden are cowards. In reality, our country's finances are not without solutions. It is merely that in the past there was wealth without governance; there was no budget or final accounting, and public and private matters were never clearly distinguished. Moreover, under the pretext of financial hardship, the people were exploited in various ways, even to the point of killing the goose to get the eggs. On the one hand, the people's blood and sweat were exhausted to be used for military preparations, military expenses, and fueling internal strife; on the other hand, the people were not given opportunities for production. If the people are poor, how can the nation not be poor? If the national economy is depleted, how can the nation's finances not go bankrupt? Therefore, our country does not suffer from a lack of wealth, but from a lack of governance, and from using wealth in unproductive ways that go against economic principles.</p>
<p>We believe that in order to resist the violent Japanese today, it is essential to issue 200 million yuan in national defense bonds for a sustained struggle. To rejuvenate our nation and lay the foundation for our country, it is also essential to issue national revival bonds to develop the interior. Under today's circumstances, it is not enough to sustain ourselves without developing the interior and developing the rural economy. With our country's vast land and abundant resources, even developing a few provinces would be more than enough to resist the violent Japanese.</p>
<p>The national revival bonds are also assumed to be 200 million yuan, to be used exclusively for the development of the Northwest and Southwest, and absolutely not allowed to be diverted for internal warfare. A committee composed of people's organizations will be established to supervise the government, and public designs will be controlled. Foreign experts will be hired to utilize their technology and actively work on: 1) facilitating transportation, 2) reviving agriculture and increasing agricultural production, 3) establishing basic industries, 4) supporting inland enterprises that are on the verge of bankruptcy, to at least ensure that people can be self-sufficient in clothing and food. Only then can we wage a sustained struggle against the violent Japanese.</p>
<p>We believe that talented people in the wealthy regions of the Southeast should no longer believe that Suzhou and Hangzhou are havens of comfort, or harbor the dream of becoming fat, rich tycoons abroad when the country is about to fall. Seeing the brutality of the Japanese army this time, it is clear that there will be no happy land in the coastal areas of the Southeast in the near future. Therefore, we should go to the interior as soon as possible, contribute our wealth and efforts, and concentrate our strength to develop the interior. If the interior is developed, the national foundation will be solid, the people will all benefit, and we will be safe. Otherwise, in this chaotic situation, we can only perish together. If the country falls and the family is destroyed, where will we find refuge?</p>

<p>No fighting in Zhabei or Wusong</p>
<p>In Zhabei, gun and machine gun fire was heard from 7 PM to 12 AM last night, audible in the concessions, but the gunfire was sparse. After 12 AM, it was very quiet. According to the Garrison Headquarters, there was also no fighting in Wusong last night.</p>

<p>No fierce fighting at Yunzaobang yesterday</p>
<p>Japanese warships have been attacking the Wusongkou forts for days without success. From 6 AM yesterday, seven Japanese warships again shelled our Wusong forts from the waters of Sanjiaoshui, stopping at 1 PM, firing over a hundred shells in total. Our side did not return fire. There was no intense fighting yesterday with the enemy facing Yunzaobang. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e5">Enemy Ships Launch Three Fierce Attacks <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Around 6 AM yesterday, seven Japanese warships anchored in the waters of Sanjiaoshui fiercely bombarded the forts and towns of Wusong with heavy artillery. The seaward-facing wall of China Public School was struck by over twenty shells, leaving numerous holes, ranging in size from about fourteen inches. The school's dormitories and library were completely destroyed. Four shells hit houses in Wusong Town; two exploded, immediately starting a fire that continued to burn until 6 PM, still not extinguished. Because the enemy warships were in front, there was no way to put out the fire, so it spread with the wind. All the houses in the town will be reduced to ashes. As the enemy warships fiercely bombarded, our troops stationed there were fully prepared but did not return fire. Seeing that our side was not moving, the enemy warships continued shelling while sending three Japanese merchant ships, fully loaded with enemy troops, hoping to use the cover of artillery fire to approach the beach of the fort and land there. All were strafed by our troops with machine guns, causing many enemy casualties. The Japanese merchant ships were also damaged and fled back. Later, the enemy troops arrived for the second time, still using small boats to transport them, and were also strafed and completely repelled by our troops in the same way. When the enemy attacked for the third time, more than ten aircraft also came out to assist in the battle and provide cover, bombarding fiercely. However, struggling until about 11 AM, they were finally defeated and retreated by our troops. In summary, the enemy warships fired over one hundred shells yesterday. Except for the explosions in Wusong Town, the rest did not explode. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than two hundred casualties, while our army only had more than ten soldiers wounded.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Fort Hotel in Danger <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that several Japanese troop transport ships passed Wusong this morning (the 15th) and were fired upon by Chinese soldiers with machine guns and rifles. It is believed that several people were killed or injured on board, but the number could not be ascertained. Japanese warships and aircraft then engaged the Chinese soldiers. Two fires broke out along the riverfront, one near the Fort Hotel. The hotel owner, Davis, is eighty years old. Although the Japanese headquarters asked the British Consulate to warn him, the old man resolutely guarded his old home. Today, a representative of the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury inquired of the Japanese naval authorities who were shelling whether the shells had hit the hotel. The reply was that it was impossible to know for sure because it was obscured by thick smoke. Someone watching from a distance with a telescope could not see the British flag flying on the hotel's flagpole.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Enemy Planes Drop Bombs Everywhere <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Throughout yesterday, enemy planes in groups of two or three continuously circled our military positions to reconnoiter and drop bombs. Our troops, accustomed to the enemy planes flying very high, did not attack. Around 7 AM, the enemy troops facing Yunzaobang shelled our military positions but stopped shortly thereafter. Around 10 AM, four enemy planes flew out from Shanghai to Baoshan's Luodian Town, dropping over ten bombs, all of which landed in the fields surrounding the town, fortunately without injuring anyone. All of Baoshan's institutions moved to the town to conduct business after the Wusong battle began. Quite a few Wusong residents also fled to the town, so the whole town panicked after the enemy planes dropped bombs. Shops immediately closed their doors one after another, and residents helped the old and carried the young to Jiading to seek refuge, causing exceptional disorder. The enemy planes left the town around 11 AM and flew east. Around 1 PM, a small squad of enemy soldiers, about thirty or forty people, was discovered between Houjia Bridge and Jijia Bridge, and was immediately repelled by our troops. Furthermore, hundreds of municipal houses in the area of Dongsheng Road, Wenchang Road, Miaonong, Gaojiachang, and Nanchang Road in East Wusong Town were hit by sulfur bombs dropped by enemy planes around 12 PM yesterday, instantly causing a large fire that spread everywhere and did not extinguish until late at night. Around 1 PM yesterday afternoon, a shallow-draft merchant ship of the Nissin Kisen Kaisha, with its name already painted over, loaded with two hundred White Russians, sailed from Shanghai to the Zhanghuabang grain station wharf. After landing, they went directly to the enemy military headquarters at the Lianglu factory.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Our Military Front Progresses <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army's three-pronged attack failed, they have been unable to launch a counterattack due to excessive casualties. Although a large number of ground troops, about 20,000 men, were transported to the front lines yesterday, they have not yet completed their deployment, so all defense lines except Wusong were relatively quiet yesterday. Taking advantage of this opportunity, our new front lines have made progress.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Yangxing Designated as a War Zone <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Yangxing is located behind Wusong, more than ten li away from Wusong. Since the Japanese attacked Wusong, Japanese troops have been seen in Jiangwan and Zhabei, and many have taken the back roads from Shanghai to Wusong, passing through Dachang, Liuhang, and Yangxing. Recently, due to the tense situation, Yangxing has also been designated as a war zone. Yesterday, Red Cross vehicles going to Wusong stopped at Yangxing and could not advance further. At 6 AM yesterday morning, four Japanese aircraft dropped bombs and opened fire with machine guns in the area of Hujiazhuang, Yangxing. Four bombs were dropped in front of Yangxing Town, but fortunately they did not explode. One bomb landed in Hujiazhuang, destroying a tofu shop, a small tea house, and half of the Guandi Temple.</p>

<p>Reporter Visits Fort Taiwan</p>
<p>Troops in trenches calm</p>
<p>Our reporter set out for Wusong Fort Taiwan yesterday morning at 11 AM, passing through Dachang, Liuhang, and Yangxing, arriving at Tongji University at 1 PM. At that time, four or five enemy planes were flying in the sky, dropping bombs, causing fires where they landed. Locals said that there were fires in Song Town every day. The walls of the western-style houses on the east side of the school were riddled with bullet holes like honeycombs. Another unfinished new western-style house also had its roof pierced by artillery shells. The reporter encountered a military officer in the school who led him to the brigade headquarters to meet Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan. Weng was happily chatting around the table with Fang Xingwu, Zhang Zilian, and Wu Mai. Brigade Commander Weng then sent someone to accompany him to Fort Taiwan. Passing through China Public School, the school's library, new dormitory, and auditorium were riddled with bullet holes. Wusong Station was almost completely destroyed. Along the way, the scene was desolate. Most of the troops were lying in the trenches, talking and laughing, and some were playing phonographs and harmonicas, showing their calmness. After arriving at the fort, Company Commander Hu Huanran greeted them and inspected the area. The defense arrangements were extremely strict, and the storage of artillery shells was abundant. Looking far away at the waters of Sanjiaoshui, there were six or seven enemy warships, about 10,000 meters away, to prevent the fort from firing. According to the fort defense troops, there are usually more than twenty enemy warships on average every day; today (i.e., yesterday) the number was particularly reduced. According to Company Commander Hu, the enemy warships had been bombarding our fort from 6 AM to 1 PM, firing about two hundred shells in total, which were completely of a deterrent nature and had no practical effect. The reporter asked questions, and they were answered in detail, and their friendly attitude aroused respect for our defense troops. The reporter bid farewell around 2 PM and returned to Shanghai along the original route.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Battle Situation in Zhabei Yesterday <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Enemy troops replaced, bombarded by our forces</p>
<p>Enemy planes drop bombs, repelled by our forces</p>
<p>In the Zhabei area, there was no fierce fighting from morning to night yesterday because the Japanese were replacing their newly arrived army to reinforce the defense. However, the enemy forces feared that our troops would advance and fired shells or machine guns at us from time to time. When the enemy's new troops were being replaced, our army used small steel cannons to bombard them, hitting the Japanese naval team on Doule'an Road, causing many naval casualties. In addition, the enemy forces sent aircraft to drop bombs on our positions but were repelled by our high-altitude guns. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e12">All Roads Quiet <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>In the Zhabei area, the enemy forces did not dare to attack yesterday after being hit hard at Caojia Bridge, Yunzaobang on the 13th, so all roads were very calm. However, in the area of Tiantong'an and Baziqiao yesterday morning, the enemy forces opened fire on our front lines with several cannons due to the replacement of troops, and our troops immediately returned fire, which stopped immediately. There were no battles from morning to dusk at Baoxing Road, Qiujiang Road, Fuxing Road, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Enemy Planes Drop Bombs <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Around 10 AM yesterday, the enemy forces sent six military aircraft to reconnoiter our military positions in Zhabei. When flying over Tiantong'an, Yokohama Road, etc., they dropped more than ten bombs, killing two residents and injuring five or six people. More than ten houses were also set on fire by the bombs in Tiantong'an. When the enemy planes dropped bombs, our army immediately used high-altitude artillery to fire, and the enemy planes began to flee. However, at 11:30 AM, four more enemy planes were discovered, flying to the vicinity of the Zhenru International Radio Station to drop bombs, hoping to destroy our radio station. Our garrison used high-altitude artillery to bombard them, and the enemy planes did not dare to linger and fled urgently. It is said that one of them was shot down by our army, but it has not been confirmed.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Shells Hit Naval Team <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that five Japanese transport ships carrying infantry, artillery, and supplies sailed into the upper reaches of the Huangpu River this morning (the 15th) and dropped anchor at the Osaka Shosen Kaisha Wharf and the Huishan Wharf. The troops on board disembarked and headed towards Yangshupu. The supplies will be unloaded starting in the afternoon. The vanguard of the Japanese army drove six cars, four large trucks, and several motorcycles this morning to inspect the front lines on North Sichuan Road. When the vehicles were near the end of North Sichuan Road, the Chinese army bombarded them with steel cannons. As the vehicles turned into Bazilu, one shell fell in the courtyard of the West Children's Public School, shattering several panes of glass. Two more shells fell at No. 265 Doule'an Road, the residence of a Japanese naval team, killing and injuring several sailors. At least a dozen shells fell within a hundred yards of the Japanese naval headquarters on North Sichuan Road this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Enemy Shells Fall in Concession <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that at 5:30 yesterday (the 14th), when five Japanese field guns bombarded the North Railway Station, several members of the American Chamber of Commerce and the British Chamber of Commerce A Team were almost affected. The shelling lasted for an hour and a half and fired eleven shells one after another. Several shells landed near the C Fortress where the Chamber of Commerce was stationed. The team officer immediately reported to the Chamber of Commerce Commander, Colonel Thomas, who ordered a temporary withdrawal during the shelling. It is claimed that the Japanese cannons were installed near the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Bazilu. It is also said that between 9 PM and 10 PM last night (the 14th), three shells landed on Moganshan Road in the Public Concession, between Tokyo Road and Suzhou Creek. One shell pierced the roof and two pierced the walls, apparently shells from a three-inch gun. Judging from their direction, they must have come from the direction of Hongkou Park.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Inspection Report of Wusong <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Fang Zhenwu Offers Opinions</p>
<p>Wu Representative Kowtows in Tears</p>
<p>True Situation of the Fierce Battle of Yunzaobang</p>
<p>Our Trenches are Constructed Solidly</p>
<p>Since the violent Japanese increased their troops by 20,000 men arriving in Shanghai, all parties believed that there would be fierce battles in the next few days, and the focus of the fierce battles would be on the gains and losses of Wusong. A reporter believes that the victory or defeat of Wusong is directly related to the success or failure of the Shanghai situation and the fate of the country is very important. Therefore, yesterday morning, accompanied by Central Committee member Fang Zhenwu, National Salvation Army Commander Zhang Zilian, Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation Joint Association Representative Wu Mai, and others, drove to inspect. Passing through Zhenru, there were a total of three Japanese aircraft in the air, coming and going to reconnoiter. Our military soldiers fired high-altitude guns to bombard them. The third plane immediately fell like a falling leaf. Then it flew west all the time. The enemy plane discovered that our army had fired, so it pretended to be shot down and fell straight to the safety line, and then opened at full speed and galloped away. However, after the Japanese planes, they did not dare to love the clear sky of Zhenru again. When the reporter's car approached Wusong, there were also two Japanese aircraft circling over the reporter's car. When they passed diagonally, they shot down with machine guns. Like this, three or four times, fortunately not shot. When entering the forward command headquarters, General Weng was pressing the map with a red pencil and making notes on the map.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Fang Zhenwu Generously Expressed His Views <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Fang expressed his respect and admiration for General Weng. Furthermore, he stated his views on defending Wusong. Fang was a hero against Japan in Jinan in the past, and he repeatedly frustrated the Japanese army. He was extremely indignant at this violent Japanese invasion, and he regretted that he could not participate in the front-line battle. Fang said briefly that the enemy's attack on Wusong was advantageous in rapid acquisition, and our defense of Wusong was advantageous in slow warfare. Constructing new, strong fortifications and storing sufficient food supplies are all necessary tasks. If the enemy soldiers fight repeatedly and are repeatedly frustrated, their attitude will soften accordingly. Afterwards, Fang and General Weng briefly discussed the importance of the distribution of troops, the key points of offensive and defensive trade-offs, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Lawyer Wu Kowtows in Tears <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Later, Lawyer Wu Mai, representative of the Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation Joint Association, expressed his sincere condolences to General Weng, and said that all the people of Shanghai are determined to live and die with the 19th Route Army. General Weng then spoke to everyone present, saying that I was ordered to defend Wusong to the death, and I would never allow the Japanese soldiers to invade. I ordered my subordinates yesterday to embrace the determination to die in order to fulfill the military's duty to defend the land. And said that if our people do not kill a Japanese person before they die, they will not close their eyes after death. When General Weng spoke, his attitude was solemn and his grief overflowed his words. Lawyer Wu Mai was greatly moved and suddenly rushed to General Weng, knelt down and kowtowed twice, saying that he represented the 400 million compatriots of the whole country to pay tribute to General Weng and wish the general victory. He said with tears in his voice, and General Weng hurriedly helped him up, his eyes also filled with tears.</p>
<h3 id="e19">True Situation of the Fierce Battle on the 13th <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The battle of Yunzaobang on the 13th was the fiercest since the beginning of the war. Our newspaper has detailed reports. The reporter asked a staff officer present about the truth of the fierce battle. According to him, around 8 AM on the 13th, the enemy took advantage of the smoke to secretly cross the river in the Caojiadu area, about two or three thousand people. Our army discovered it and immediately sent a team to meet the battle. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and the enemy did not have time to build fortifications. From 9 AM to 4 PM, our army continued to launch fierce charges. Although the enemy was gradually unable to support, there were many enemy machine guns, and stubborn resistance caused our side to suffer considerable losses. Battalion Commander Li Rongxi was killed in battle (Editor's note: Battalion Commander Li was a Taishan native from Guangdong, graduated from the Japanese Army Noncommissioned Officer School, usually gentle and strict in training troops. He made significant military achievements during the suppression of the Red Army in Jiangxi. Unfortunately, he died for the country. Li Jun was a close friend of the reporter. Holding a pen to write this, I can't help but shed tears.) However, the enemy also suffered heavy losses, and in the end, they barely resisted. That night, Deputy Division Commander Zhang Yan led two battalions to attack the Japanese army's camp with grenades. As soon as the artillery fire started, the enemy army scattered and collapsed without any resistance. It was regrettable that Yunzaobang happened to be at low tide at the time, with water only knee-deep, so a part of the collapsed Japanese soldiers were able to wade across the water and escape, and could not be completely annihilated, which was very regrettable. However, after this battle, the Japanese soldiers were as fearful of the Chinese soldiers as mice.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Enemy Forces Attacked Again Yesterday Morning <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 14th) near 6 o'clock, the Japanese soldiers attacked our military positions with heavy artillery, and the artillery fire was extremely fierce. At 6:30, six enemy planes also came out to assist in the battle, throwing bombs everywhere, but because they failed to hit, the damage was very small. Our army knew that the Japanese army was not able to launch a large-scale attack for a while after its defeat on the 13th. Its fierce artillery fire was probably only for demonstration purposes, so it did not counterattack. Around 9 o'clock, the artillery fire stopped, but there were still two or three Japanese planes in the air, still making boring performances.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Trenches Constructed Very Well <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>During the conversation, the Japanese planes were still circling in the air and throwing three bombs, with loud booms. It was said that the Japanese planes would throw bombs when they saw a large crowd of people. Since the number of bombs thrown was large, they could not help but hit them occasionally. It was more than enough to destroy our civilian houses, but it was not enough to attack our army. Recently, even the power of deterrence has been greatly reduced, because civilian houses have been destroyed and cannot be destroyed, and there is no need to worry about it. The army held still and did not panic. The reporter and Fang, Zhang, Wu and others walked to the third line of trenches to inspect, and were very gratified to see the perfection of their construction. Fang still praised it and said that even if the Japanese army's shells once destroyed these trenches, they could still be used. The soldiers in the trenches were all spirited, as if victory belonged only to us. General Weng said that the soldiers of our army were all eager to fight in this battle, which was really commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Telegram of Thanks from the 19th Route Army <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Inspiring to read</p>
<p>The entire army of the 19th Route Army thanks all sectors and reported, "To all institutions, public groups, compatriots at home and overseas: The violent Japanese invaded Dong Province, and our country endured and retreated to seek a peaceful and proper solution. Unexpectedly, the enemy used the habitual skill of advancing an inch and getting a foot and invaded Songhu in a big way. Our army has the responsibility to defend the land and defends itself for justice. For two weeks, the enemy used strong reinforcements and sharp guns and cannons, but the result was repeated defeats and failed to succeed. This is because the strong will be broken, and the unjust will perish. This is not what the military dares to covet. Recently, we have repeatedly received letters and telegrams from compatriots from all walks of life, either to give spiritual encouragement or to provide material assistance. The enthusiasm and chivalry have increased our inspiration. Because the evil enemy has not been pacified and the army is busy, we do not have time to reply one by one. Our army and soldiers swear to spill the last drop of blood on the Huangpu River to live up to the expectations of our patriotic compatriots and adhere to this ambition as a pillow of gratitude. Generalities, I hope you will be aware. Sincerely, the entire army of the 19th Route Army.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Request for Liu Zhi to Assist Shanghai by Telegram <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Telegram from Xu Zhongsu and Others</p>
<p>Telegram from Xu Zhongsu and others to Liu Zhi of Kaifeng, Chairman Jingfu: "We respectfully note, taking advantage of the economic panic among the powers, and their lack of time for long-range planning, the violent Japanese are forcibly pursuing their decades-long planned continental policy amid our country's frequent troubles and unprepared national defense.  Northeast Border Defense Commander Zhang Xueliang, failing to defend and retreating, has led them to believe that all Chinese soldiers are like Zhang Xueliang. They treat Shanghai as they treated Liaoshen and Tianjin, not knowing that our loyal and courageous 19th Route Army is not comparable to Zhang.  Furthermore, Japan, after the rise of materialism, no longer possesses the Yamato spirit of twenty years ago, valuing profit and fearing death, complacent in civil affairs and neglecting military matters. Class consciousness is widespread among the people, and the concept of the nation is weakening daily.  Our army, incited by foreign insults, has doubled its morale, possessing a spirit of certain death and unafraid of hardship. Its battle experience is especially unmatched.  Therefore, after more than ten days of continuous battles, there has not been a single defeat. If the people of the country are of one mind and heart, and jointly seek a sustained struggle, then the unreasonable aggression of the Japanese will be a good medicine for our country's revival.  This is what our people should take as a cause for self-improvement, and not need to discourage ourselves. But if we want to seek a sustained struggle, then Shanghai, as the center of economy and public opinion, must first be secured. The reason the Japanese risked infamy to attack Shanghai this time is that they wanted to seize our country's throat in one fell swoop and force us to submit.  Although they have been defeated, in order to maintain their great power's prestige, they will not hesitate to make any sacrifices to achieve their aim. If we do not resist until the day of final victory, what is the meaning of the sacrifice of millions of refugees and astronomical wealth in Shanghai?  If Shanghai falls and resources are cut off, how will the nation survive? Now that the government has clearly ordered active resistance, it is not generously supporting the resisting troops. The generals are merely saying they are waiting for orders with their spears as pillows, but when will they wait until?  Must they wait until the 19th Route Army is completely annihilated before rushing to the rescue? The public is in a state of confusion and cannot fathom the depths of the situation. Your Excellency was born in the land of Wenshan, and has long heard the teachings of loyalty and righteousness. Watching the fire from across the river is certainly not what you desire.  Therefore, we have exhausted the feelings of our hometown to emulate Qin Ting's cry for help. If you can persuade the authorities to fully undertake the punishment, it would be a great blessing for the country.  Otherwise, we also pray that you quickly lead your troops south to kill the enemy, fulfilling the military's duty to protect the country and defend the people.  We hope you will not be constrained by your superior's orders and disregard the party and the nation's peril. Protecting the country and defending the people is a hundred times more important than obeying superiors. We earnestly present these words, filled with anticipation. Xu Zhongsu, Zhang Dingfan, Jiang Hefeng, Yu Fen, Huang Jiemin, Chen Shaoxian, Zhou Yongneng, Ouyang Xuan, Min Tianpei, He Wuwu, Wu Mai, Yao Min, Zhang Heng, Dong Qunfu, Liang Biqun, Deng Wenhui, Li Jianhou, and others respectfully bow."</p>
<h3 id="e24">Four-Power Peace Movement <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Envoy Currently Requesting Instructions</p>
<p>The peace movement of the four envoys of Great Britain, the United States, France, and Italy has recently been in a state of near collapse. British Ambassador Lampson, American Ambassador Johnson, French Ambassador Wilden, and Italian Chargé d'affaires Ciano had a meeting with Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi on Sunday. The Japanese ambassador's attitude was still very strong, and the ambassadors felt that the situation was difficult. However, given the great stake in the commercial port of Shanghai, they were eager to find a solution in a hopeless situation, hoping to turn hostility into friendship. The Japanese ambassador agreed to seek instructions from the Tokyo government, and the four envoys of Great Britain, the United States, France, and Italy also sought instructions from their respective governments. The initial content of the four-power mediation was based on the five peace proposals previously put forward by the four countries to Japan. The Japanese ambassador strongly disagreed with the fifth article, because Japan still considered the Shanghai incident a local issue. Shigemitsu Aoi also stated that the 19th Route Army must first withdraw from Wusong and Zhabei before negotiations could begin. At the very least, they must wait until the Japanese army occupied Wusong before a peaceful resolution could be considered, because the Japanese military viewed the loss of face due to setbacks, and were unwilling to lose face by stepping down. Finally, the British ambassador proposed a compromise solution, the exact content of which is still being kept strictly secret. It is only known that the Japanese ambassador has sought instructions from the Tokyo government. Aides to the American ambassador told our reporter yesterday that no concrete decision had been made on the mediation, but the path to peace had not yet been closed. Italian Chargé d'affaires Ciano told reporters last night that he was in close contact with the ambassadors. It is still difficult to say whether peace is hopeful or hopeless. Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Qin Runqing, and Mu Ouchu had previously met with the four envoys of Great Britain, the United States, France, and Italy. Wang Xiaolai talked about the process yesterday, saying that they only asked the envoys to pay attention to the atrocities of the Japanese from the standpoint of businessmen. The losses in Zhabei were over 100 million yuan. The residents in the Hongkou area north of the Suzhou River originally believed that the protection of the Municipal Council was reliable, so most of them did not flee. Later, they were abused and killed by the Japanese, with no way to complain. As for the question of war or peace, it was too important and should be presided over by the government, so it was not mentioned, he said.</p>

<p>Gratitude to Father Giequinto and the Vice-Commander of the Merchant Corps</p>
<p>From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 12th of this month, the Chinese and Japanese military authorities, at the request of the British Consul-General, observed a four-hour truce. Many refugees in the Zhabei war zone were rescued from danger. Mayor Wu believed that Father Giequinto was the initiator of the rescue of refugees in the war zone, and that Vice-Commander Heilebert of the International Merchant Corps was the most helpful in handling the rescue of refugees. Moreover, both of them personally led rescue personnel to the war zone during the four-hour ceasefire to rescue refugees. This spirit of benevolence is truly admirable. He sent letters to the two men yesterday to express his gratitude.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Headquarters</p>
<h3 id="e26">Issued a Warning to the Chinese Army <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Containing Unreasonable Demands</p>
<p>And of a Threatening Nature</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that yesterday (the 14th) afternoon, the Japanese military headquarters issued a warning to the Chinese army, stating that the Chinese army must withdraw from the vicinity of Shanghai, including the Nanshi and Zhabei areas. If the Chinese army does not withdraw, the Japanese army gathered in Shanghai will use extreme measures to deal with them.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that Lieutenant General Ueda denied that he had sent an ultimatum to the Chinese army, asking them to withdraw from Zhabei. He also stated that his arrival in Shanghai was not for the purpose of continuing the war. His sole purpose was to ensure the safety of Japanese residents in Shanghai. He hoped that the Shanghai incident could be resolved peacefully, and he would do his best to achieve this solution. However, it was a desirable condition that the Chinese army withdraw from Shanghai to a certain distance, so that the safety of Shanghai could be ensured. He also stated that he had not yet determined the strategy of his army before proceeding to withdraw the Chinese army. When asked how far the Chinese army should withdraw, Ueda smiled and replied, "The farther the better," and hoped that it would not be necessary to issue an ultimatum, and that the Chinese army could withdraw voluntarily. Ueda currently has his headquarters in the northeast end of the concession, and refused to tell the guest the actual number of troops currently landing, or the plans that were about to be implemented, saying that everything would depend on the development of the situation.</p>

<p>The China Press reports that Mr. Chen, adjutant of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, upon hearing that the Japanese army had transported a large number of gas shells to the Wusong area, stated last night that the use of gas in warfare was considered illegal by civilized countries. Japan's violation of international treaties would sacrifice the lives of innocent people, and it was feared that a sudden change in wind direction would blow toxic gas into foreign concessions, where civilians without gas masks would suffer the same fate. It is now expected that Chinese and foreign residents will ask the Municipal Council and foreign authorities to make a serious demand to Japan that this type of weapon not be used.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that the Japanese military authorities claim that Japan is complying with international treaties prohibiting the use of toxic gas, and that the Japanese army in Shanghai does not have this type of shell.</p>

<p>It is heard that the Japanese army has recently entrusted a foreign merchant firm to rent trucks from Chinese merchants, willing to pay a rental fee of 60 yuan per day for a period of ten days. The driver and gasoline are to be provided by the firm. However, many Chinese transportation companies, given the national crisis, are unwilling to rent out their trucks.</p>

<p>Seven Transport Ships Entered the Port</p>
<p>Carrying 13,000 Army Troops</p>
<p>The Kanazawa 9th Division of the Japanese army, dispatched to Shanghai as reinforcements, including its subordinate infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering, logistics, aviation, communication, machine gun, and other units, has an actual strength of over 20,000 men. On the nights of the 13th and the afternoons of the 14th, nine transport ships, escorted by warships, successively landed in Shanghai at the Osaka, Wayside, and Huangpu wharves, carrying a total of 7,300 to 7,400 officers and soldiers. The rest consisted of large artillery pieces, tanks, machine guns and cannons, explosives and ammunition, as well as 800 warhorses and communication pigeons and electrical materials. The 13,000-strong contingent of infantry, artillery, and engineering troops, etc., only began to be brought to Shanghai gradually by Japanese-hired pilots yesterday morning. An investigation revealed that the large group of Japanese soldiers was brought to Shanghai yesterday by seven large transport merchant ships, each carrying between one and three thousand men. They entered Wusong and all landed at the Yangshupu, Huangpu, and Wayside Osaka wharves. The names of the ships and their times of arrival are recorded as follows: 1) Miharu Maru entered the port at 8:50 AM; 2) Ida Maru entered the port at 8:50 AM; 3) Shinyu Maru entered the port at 8:50 AM; 4) Florida Maru entered the port at 9:30 AM; 5) Hakkar Maru entered the port at 10:45 AM; 6) Uzina Maru entered the port at 10:55 AM; 7) Shokyu Maaru entered the port at 11:15 AM. All the above ships were fully loaded with troops to Shanghai, protected by one squadron of fifteen Japanese Navy torpedo boats. After arriving at the docks, the soldiers disembarked and were transported to the front lines in large numbers of trucks.</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Since the 9th Division has come to Shanghai this time with so many troops, the demand for food and military supplies is also very large. The first batch of transport ships to arrive in Shanghai the other day, the Nagasaki Maru, Tsukuba Maru, Amo Maru, and Fa Dingxi Maru, etc., were escorted by a Japanese warship yesterday and left Shanghai for Japan to transport supplies to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The China Press reports that the Japanese 9th Division, which landed yesterday (14th), included two infantry brigades, one cavalry regiment, one artillery regiment, one engineering and communication battalion, and one logistics battalion, with a large amount of military supplies, 800 warhorses for pulling artillery and riding, as well as numerous motorcycles and tanks, and several aircraft, approximately 120 homing pigeons. About 100 field guns were seen being pulled by horses through Yangshupu Road yesterday, and countless boxes of artillery shells, firearms, and explosives were also pulled by horses through Yangshupu Road, showing that the Japanese army will put all its efforts into a fierce attack on the unbreakable lines of the Chinese 19th Route Army.</p>

<p>Assaulting the American Vice-Consul, the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that around noon on February 10th, American Vice-Consul Lin Huade accompanied Mrs. Yang, each carrying a pass, to Mrs. Yang's former residence at 129 White Paul Road to look for her missing seven-year-old daughter. While passing North Sichuan Road, after the pass was inspected by the Japanese Navy defense soldiers and the patrol team of retired soldiers, two retired soldiers were dispatched to accompany them. After walking a few dozen steps, they were again stopped by Japanese retired soldiers. The body of Mrs. Yang was searched. Vice-Consul Lin protested the insult to the woman in his care and was assaulted. However, Vice-Consul Lin insisted that he was performing official duties under government orders and should not be interfered with, so he finally reached 129 White Paul Road, only to find that the door had been destroyed and the room was empty. He returned to the Consulate General to report the humiliation, and the American Consul-General lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul-General, which has not yet been answered.</p>
<p>Tearing Up Two Passes, the North China Daily News reports that Englishman Pax, formerly a martial arts instructor at the Western Children's Public School, was traveling by car yesterday afternoon (14th) to the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Dixwei Road, no more than a dozen steps away from the Dixwei Road Police Station, when he was suddenly stopped by approximately fifty Japanese retired soldiers (i.e., reservists). Pax presented two passes, one issued by the Municipal Council for travel after curfew at night, and the other for entering and exiting the concession during curfew, which was stamped with the seal of Japanese Navy Commander Rear Admiral Shiozawa. The Japanese soldiers immediately seized the two passes and tore them into pieces. Two Western police officers at the nearby Third Section were unable to do anything. Pax protested the tearing up of the passes, and the Japanese soldiers immediately assaulted him and detained the car. Pax later realized that there was no point in protesting and went to the headquarters of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces. An officer then dispatched soldiers to escort him and ordered the release of the car. Pax was then able to return by car. It is reported that the matter has been reported to the British Consul-General, who has requested that negotiations be initiated.</p>
<p>Not Allowed to Move Furniture, the North China Daily News reports that the police officers serving at the Dixwei Road Police Station were again interfered with yesterday (14th). It seems that the Japanese plainclothes police are still implementing their ronin policy. One police officer was stopped three times from the police station to Peng Road and only managed to pass with force. The Japanese Consulate General had issued a special pass to the police to assist Chinese and foreign residents in moving furniture, but the Japanese plainclothes police still did not allow passage. Those with this pass were only allowed to pass alone, and were not allowed to take out any items.</p>
<p>Various Harassment Actions, the North China Daily News reports that there were several violent incidents in Hongkou again yesterday (14th). An Englishman from the Shanghai Power Company, Mr. Briggs, who resides at 707 Dixwei Road, returned home at 2:00 PM yesterday. As soon as he entered the front door and walked through the first room, he saw two Japanese naval landing force soldiers in the back room. When asked what they were doing, the two immediately fled through the back door and ran to the area where the Japanese army had set up machine guns. Mr. Briggs then reported the incident to the police station, stating that when he returned home last Thursday, a radio worth 130 yuan was still safely inside the house, but when he searched for it yesterday, it was gone. Also, an hour earlier, two Japanese Marine Corps soldiers and a Japanese special patrol officer brought a British Chinese man to the Hongkou Police Station, saying that they had found a Chinese volunteer army hat and two books on the Manchurian problem in his home at 1259 Dixwei Road. When the Chinese man explained that he was British, the Japanese soldiers returned the military hat and books and left. The Chinese man was also released. Also, yesterday morning, two special patrol officers personally saw several Japanese Marine Corps soldiers arresting two Chinese women and taking them away, whereabouts unknown. It is said that the two women were arrested because they were carrying maps owned by the Japanese. Also, a Chinese man who owned a grocery store at 43 Broadway Road reported to the police station at 9:35 AM yesterday that an hour earlier, 30 Japanese Marine Corps soldiers had forcibly entered the store and caused great damage. Also, at 9:40 AM, a store owner reported to the police station that several Japanese ronin had entered the store and stolen firewood worth 60 yuan. The police station has learned the license plate number of the truck they used. Also, a Westerner reported that Japanese ronin had stolen several sets of bedding from his home. The Japanese stated that they had not stolen them, but had only borrowed them for the hospital's use.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Telegram to the Nation Requesting Assistance <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>After the high school and university departments of Chih Tze Institute in this port were inexplicably burned down by the violent Japanese, the alumni association remaining in Shanghai telegraphed Yan Huiqing, our country's chief representative to Geneva, to protest to the League of Nations, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that 568 students of the school who remained in Shanghai yesterday also sent a telegram to the nation's cultural institutions and all sectors, requesting assistance, and separately telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing and the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting that a protest be lodged with the Japanese consul and that compensation be reserved. They also telegraphed the Ministry of Education, requesting that funds be allocated in advance to help with school affairs. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Nation (relayed by all national newspaper offices to compatriots in all regions for their information). The violent Japanese have inexplicably sent troops to Shanghai this time, showing no respect for our country. Their cruel and evil deeds are too numerous to record. In addition to killing and arson in prosperous cities, they have unleashed their poisonous flames and destroyed cultural institutions such as the Commercial Press, the Oriental Library, and our school, etc., in order to make our country suffer a position of irrecoverable destruction. Their intentions are insidious and unspeakable. It has been found that the middle and high school departments of our school were set on fire by Japanese soldiers on the 3rd and 13th of this month, completely burning them down. It is estimated that the material losses in both places amount to no less than one million, and the spiritual losses are even greater. Their intention is to destroy our nation by first destroying our culture. Fortunately, our loyal and brave soldiers of the 19th Route Army have risen up to defend themselves. In the past ten days, they have repeatedly defeated the arrogant captives, causing the violent Japanese to be shocked and the powers to take notice. We still hope that the compatriots of the whole country will unite as one, with a heart of certain death, with the thought of common destruction, then the national future will have hope. In addition to telegraphed Yan Representative to protest to the League of Nations, we hereby declare, the students of Chih Tze Institute and its affiliated high school, Pan Jianbo and 568 others respectfully bow.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Education, Minister Zhu Junjian of the Ministry of Education in Luoyang: The middle and high school departments of our school were set on fire by Japanese soldiers on the 3rd and 10th of this month, completely burning them down. It is estimated that the losses in both places amount to no less than one million. It is truly outrageous that they would intentionally destroy cultural institutions in this way. We hereby telegraphically request your ministry to swiftly inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with Japan, reserve compensation, and that to proceed with the resumption of school affairs, we still urge you to allocate funds in advance to provide assistance and order President He to do his best to maintain it, so that all students can complete their studies. The students of Chih Tze Institute and its affiliated high school, Pan Jianbo and 568 others respectfully bow. (The general meaning of the other two telegrams to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Shanghai Municipal Government is roughly the same)</p>
<h3 id="e34">Commercial Press Requests the Government to Demand Compensation <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial Press's General Factory and Translation Office in Zhabei, the Oriental Library, the Shang Gong Elementary School, etc., were all bombed or set on fire by Japanese aircraft, causing significant losses. The library immediately prepared documents and submitted them to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Shanghai Party Headquarters, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Social Affairs Bureau, and other party and government agencies, requesting them to lodge a serious protest with Japan and declaring that they would reserve compensation for losses. The submission is as follows: Submission for reporting the circumstances of the destruction, please swiftly protest to Japan and reserve the request for compensation, which we hope will be reviewed and implemented. Our company's printing and manufacturing general factory, and translation office, the Oriental Library, Shang Gong Elementary School, etc., have been located in Zhabei, Baoshan Road, Shanghai. On the night of the 28th of last month, the Japanese army invaded Zhabei, and on the morning of the 29th, airplanes dropped bombs in succession, completely destroying our company's printing and manufacturing general factory and Shang Gong Elementary School. On the 2nd of this month, the translation office and the Oriental Library were also set on fire and destroyed. Our company's 35 years of painstaking efforts to operate and dedicate itself to the foundation of culture have been reduced to ashes. The magnitude of the loss is indescribable. The ancient books and rare editions collected in the Oriental Library, as well as the local chronicles of provinces, prefectures, and counties in our country, and the academic books of various countries, were all gradually collected over two or thirty years with great effort. The losses are even more impossible to calculate in terms of monetary value. The board of directors of our company, due to the complete destruction of the general factory, the loss of assets, and the inability to maintain financial resources, and the inability of employees to work, had no choice but to resolve that all Shanghai lines would be closed and all employees would be laid off, pending a rough settlement of the overall situation, a shareholders' meeting would be convened, a direction would be decided, and then a method would be determined, and this has already been submitted to the competent authorities for the record. In addition to the amount of our company's losses, which will be reported in detail after we find a way to investigate and clear them, we should report in writing the circumstances of the destruction of our company's printing and manufacturing general factory, and translation office, the Oriental Library, Shang Gong Elementary School, etc., and ask for review and approval, swiftly lodge a strict protest with Japan, and declare that we will reserve the request for compensation for losses, which we would be extremely grateful for.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Shipping News During the War <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Reduced Yangtze River Service: Since the outbreak of the war, Chinese merchant ships on the Yangtze River have stopped service first. Foreign merchant ships, such as those of Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, China Navigation Company, and Jardine, Matheson, etc., initially continued to operate as usual. However, as the war has prolonged in recent days, all industries in the Shanghai area have come to a standstill, and cargo transportation upstream and downstream of the Yangtze River has also mostly stopped. Yesterday, Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson, etc., decided to cut half of their Yangtze River ships due to a lack of import and export cargo and the inability to maintain the original state, and to only operate three ships per week to provide passage for passengers.</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Departing for Hankou: Chinese ships on the Yangtze River have been suspended since the 29th of last month. However, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company decided yesterday to send the Kuaili ship to test the Yangtze River today because there was a batch of transit goods that needed to be transported to Xunhan. In order to ensure the safety of the route, it has been agreed to export at the same time as the British merchant ships Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson's Wusong Ruihe.</p>
<p>Ningbo Service Delayed: A total of five Ningbo ships entered Shanghai yesterday, including the Xin Beijing, Xin Ningshao, Songpu, and An Ning. However, the entrance time was delayed due to obstruction by artillery fire while sailing into Wusong. It was too late to load cargo and passengers on the same day, so it was postponed for one day and changed to sailing today. Only one ship went to Ningbo yesterday.</p>
<p>Increased Suzhou Service: In recent days, refugees from Shanghai have been fleeing to Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang. Yuantong, Lixing, Qingji, and Gongmao have all added special Suzhou services to meet the needs of refugees. From today, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in the inner harbor will also add four small steamer shifts, specializing in Shanghai-Suzhou services. Xie Xinglitong has also opened a Dangshu class. Yesterday, it was widely rumored in Shanghai that a Shanghai-Changzhou ship had an accident with a pirate attack in Yangcheng Lake, but each of the ship bureaus denied it. However, the He'an ship of a certain bureau was indeed robbed by bandits when traveling from Shanghai to Suzhou, and the captain was shot and killed by bandits at Yushui, and the passengers' property was lost, but no lives were injured. The victimized captain is now being coffined and buried by a certain bureau, and compensation is being given.</p>

In this critical situation, it is appropriate to convene it as soon as possible, so that it can centralize strength and consolidate the central government. We have heard that there are discussions to cancel it, which would damage the government's credibility and discourage all parties' enthusiasm, which would be detrimental to the country and the public. We hope that all members will be telegraphed as soon as possible to gather at sea and hold a preliminary meeting first to decide on the meeting matters. We await your reply. Li Yutang, You Lie, Zhang Zizhu, respectfully, Yuan. Another telegram: Telegram from Li Yutang, You Lie, and others in Hong Kong, to be sent to Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, Huang Renzhi, and to be forwarded to all members of the National Emergency Conference in Shanghai: The situation is dangerous, and the National Emergency Conference should be convened quickly. We have read in the newspaper that Mr. Xiong Bingsan and others in Beiping have proposed to convene the conference automatically, and you have also held a meeting, which we greatly support. We also plan to invite members from Guangdong and Guangxi to hold a meeting in the south, but holding meetings in several places seems scattered. We still ask you to centralize the maritime conference as soon as possible for the convenience of progress. If there is a fixed date, we will go north to meet. We await your reply.

<p>According to Guowen News Agency, a reporter interviewed Mr. Lin Kanghou of the Bankers Association, who stated that the first Comfort Collection Point of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce established by the Bankers Association has collected approximately 190,000 yuan to date, which has been transferred to the front through the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The reporter then inquired about the Shanghai banking community's monthly supply of 190,000 yuan in military pay to the 19th Route Army. Mr. Lin replied that this was completely inaccurate and that the 190,000 yuan was the aforementioned comfort money.</p>

<p>To Mr. Jiang Renfu,</p>
<p>The Japanese bandits are provoking trouble in Shanghai. The soldiers at the front are bravely exploring the enemy and avenging the country, which is admirable. Zhenhua is unable to go to the front line for rescue work due to illness and deeply regrets it. I have tried my best to raise funds and have obtained 2,000 yuan in silver dollars, which I have sent through the Continental Bank. Please check and use it to comfort the wounded soldiers. This is just a drop in the bucket, but it is a small contribution to fulfilling my national responsibility.</p>

<p>In addition, the number of refugees injured and sick has increased daily. In light of this, the Maintenance Association's Health Group has opened a temporary hospital at No. 280 Gordon Road, which can accommodate more than 100 people. It has also consulted with the Academia Sinica to borrow the latter's facilities as a temporary hospital when needed. Male and female doctors are enthusiastically volunteering for rescue work, with telegrams arriving from as far south as Hong Kong and as far north as Beiping, expressing their willingness to fulfill their medical obligations to the injured refugees in this city.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Social Affairs Bureau Continues to Send Refugees <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>In view of the fact that the number of flood refugees from last year and those rescued from the war zone is still quite large, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau hired a small steamer and three tugboats yesterday and departed from the Metering Industry Wharf at approximately 2 p.m. for Wuxi for resettlement. More than 100 people were also given free train tickets by the bureau to be sent to Hangzhou via the Shanghai-Hangzhou passenger train. Refugees from various shelters continue to report and register at the bureau's office in Renji Shantang. The bureau will continue to find ways to hire more small steamers in the next few days to send refugees to various inland shelters.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Refugees Board Ships with Certificates <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>As the number of refugees in various shelters in this city increases daily, they cannot be accommodated. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau has consulted with various shipping companies, inland small steamers, and towboats to transport the refugees back to their native places inland. This has been reported previously. However, there are few ships and many people, resulting in severe overcrowding, which is extremely dangerous and difficult to maintain order. Furthermore, some people are taking advantage of this opportunity to mix in as refugees. Therefore, in the future, refugees sent by shelters to board ships must first obtain a boarding certificate from the Temporary Relief Association for War Zone Refugees in Renji Tang on Sixma Road before boarding the ship to avoid overcrowding and maintain security.</p>

<p>At 7 a.m. yesterday (the 15th), the Chinese Jishi Society sent rescue team leader Ling Youguang and others to Dachang to rescue wounded soldiers Xu Deyuan, Ma Wenzhi, Zhong Jie, Guo Xi, Huang Hanhe, Song Wanshan, Wang Jinhai, Xu Huaiqing, Li Ruisheng, Li Dehe, Guo Yiqing, Lai Licai, Wu Qing, Feng Baoguo, Guo Mingda, Wen Biao, and Wang Fengchi. When the vehicle was returning to Shanghai, it encountered two Japanese planes in the Miaotou area. Seeing that there were people in the vehicle wearing gray military uniforms, the planes opened fire with machine guns. Fortunately, the driver accelerated to escape, and the Japanese planes continued to chase them until they reached Zhongshan Road and flew east. Fortunately, there were no injuries. All the wounded soldiers were sent to the wounded soldiers' hospital of the Shanghai Women's Comfort Association. In the afternoon, rescue workers Wu Shaoqiu, Qian Kezeng, and others rescued more than 100 refugees in Dachang and other places. Those who did not go to relatives and friends were housed in the association's second shelter.</p>

<p>Jing'an Temple abbot Zhifa and the Shanghai Citizens' Joint Association's 22nd District Standing Committee members Xu Wenyuan, Gong Yifei, Wang Hansheng, Cai Jiugao, Wang Jianjiang, and others, in view of the suffering of the compatriots in the war zone caused by the Japanese invaders, who were displaced, hungry, cold, and subjected to strange disasters, which was unbearable to witness, jointly organized the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Shelter in Jing'an Temple with local gentry Gu Jiatang, Gong Yuequan, Zhang Pinshan, Chen Haitang, Gu Ruitang, and others. To date, for half a month, the number of refugees seeking shelter has been extraordinarily crowded. Recently, the Municipal Association also organized a rescue team, which has been dispatched to the front lines in recent days, rescuing more than 100 women and children in distress. Therefore, the number of refugees in the shelter has now reached more than 1,000 people. The original Jing'an Temple buildings are no longer sufficient to house them. Yesterday, temporary thatched houses were added, and the Jing'an Elementary School, founded by the association's committee members, was borrowed as the second refugee dormitory. The association also assigned two physicians to set up a temporary infirmary in the temple to prevent the spread of infection.</p>

<p>Ms. Ke Qingjun, a graduate of St. Mary's Hall, is only 19 years old. She was very indignant about the outbreak of the Shanghai war. Recently, she contacted the Chinese Red Cross Society and volunteered to serve as a nurse on the front lines. Xue Zhenyi, the captain of the society's second team, was concerned about the danger of sending Ke to the front lines due to her young age, so he assigned her to work as a nurse in the second hospital. Ms. Ke began working at the hospital yesterday.</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau promotes:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to the Municipal Jingye Middle School, Xinlu Normal School, and private high schools and above, stating:</p>
<p>Regarding the Ministry of Education's Order No. 737, which states: "Regarding the Ministry of Training Headquarters' inquiry on the organization of the Youth Volunteer Army, which was originally implemented to cope with the national crisis, all high school students and above should join and receive training. However, according to recent surveys, some schools still allow their students to participate or withdraw freely. This not only makes it difficult to achieve universal results but also hinders the future of intensified military training. The Ministry hereby requests that the esteemed Ministry investigate and order all public and private high schools and above in the intensified military training area to urge all students to join the Youth Volunteer Army without allowing any evasion to comply with the law and achieve results."</p>
<p>The order from the Ministry is hereby followed. This order is issued on February 15 by Xu Peihuang, Director of the Bureau.</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Bans:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau issued Public Notice No. 4 on government affairs, stating:</p>
<p>"Regarding the matter of public notice, it is observed that civil organizations in this city are actively organizing national salvation volunteer armies to jointly respond to the national crisis. Their patriotic enthusiasm is deeply commendable. However, national salvation and defense against aggression should be coordinated by the central government. This bureau has previously forwarded orders from the Ministry of Military Administration to find ways to dissuade such activities, which have been duly followed. Recently, with the invasion of Japanese troops, such activities have resurfaced, making suppression difficult. A plan was drafted and submitted to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for review. The following instructions were received:</p>
<p>'Having reviewed the submitted plan, it is observed that since the outbreak of the war, various volunteer armies have been established. While some are motivated by patriotic enthusiasm and act properly, many are taking advantage of the situation to disturb the local area. Since the Ministry of Military Administration has issued a clear order to disband them, it should be complied with. In the future, if volunteer armies are found in non-war zones, those with properly registered firearms and verified by the bureau may be reported to the Ministry for introduction to the front lines and incorporation into the armed forces. All others shall be immediately ordered to disband by the bureau to maintain order.'</p>
<p>The above order is hereby communicated to all subordinates for strict enforcement and to all citizens for compliance. Non-compliance will not be tolerated. This notice is issued on February 14 by Wen Yingxing, Director of the Bureau."</p>
<h3 id="e62">Do Not Abuse Nighttime Passes <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Unnecessary Use is Forbidden</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Pass Will Be Revoked</p>
<p>Dalu News reports that the Municipal Council issued a warning yesterday (the 14th) stating that nighttime curfew passes issued by the council are intended for use only by those who must go out for work-related reasons. Anyone found abusing this special privilege for social activities, such as attending banquets or dances, will have their pass revoked if discovered by patrols. The purpose of the nighttime curfew is to allow residents to stay safely at home at night and avoid the dangers of the streets. Furthermore, during this emergency, the patrol's duties have already been extremely burdensome, so residents staying at home can reduce some of the patrol's workload.</p>

It further stated that the company is an American-owned company and is sparing no effort in supporting the Chinese government and has also been very active in disaster relief efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Japanese Merchants Transport Yellow Powder <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Claiming it was Bedbug Powder</p>
<p>However, there are many doubts from various parties</p>
<p>Yesterday, around ten o'clock in the morning, residents inside Lane 6 of Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession suddenly discovered a large number of wooden boxes piled up downstairs at No. 3, across the street in the lane. Upon closer inspection, each box had the words "Japanese Taichang Pharmacy" pasted on it, causing great suspicion and discussion among the residents. They all believed that in this urgent time of resistance against the Japanese invaders, the Japanese were full of treacherous schemes to disrupt the rear, and they were now discovering large batches of medicine boxes like this. It was deemed necessary to thoroughly investigate what kind of medicine was stored in the boxes. While the crowd was in turmoil, the person transporting the boxes had already escaped in the meantime. He urgently went to the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession to report, claiming his name was Yang Qingdi, a Chinese, and currently a shop assistant at the Japanese Taichang Pharmacy at No. 106 Jiaotong Road in the McAteer Circle. He had been ordered by the shop owner to transport thirty-two large boxes of medicinal powder (4,000 tins per box) to Cai's residence, located at No. 3 across the street in Lane 6 of Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession, for temporary storage. Unexpectedly, upon arrival, he was noticed by the public, who suspected that the boxes contained dangerous items such as bombs and explosives, leading to his detention. Upon hearing the report, the police chief immediately dispatched three Japanese detectives and several Chinese and Western detectives, along with the reporter, to the Louza Wan French General Police Station. Together with several French police detectives, they rushed to the detention site. They opened a box and took out a tin, and inside was yellow medicinal powder. According to the Japanese shop owner of Taichang, Shimada, who was present, the yellow powder was a popular bedbug powder on the market and not a dangerous substance. The detectives then transported all thirty-two large boxes to the police station for examination. However, according to someone familiar with Western medicine, the powder obtained was indeed bedbug powder, but it contained a very strong toxic substance that could be fatal if ingested by humans. Upon hearing the news, our military authorities were extremely suspicious and planned to send a letter to the French police station to pay close attention to the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Soliciting Methods for Manufacturing Gas Masks <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>This time, the violent Japanese have repeatedly suffered setbacks, so they do not hesitate to use poison gas and poison bombs to harm our soldiers and civilians. The 19th Route Army Headquarters has specifically entrusted the Boy Scout Battlefield Service Corps of this city to solicit this type of gas mask. Since the advertisement was published, enthusiastic people have been asking the corps where to buy these masks and how to make them.

<p>Zhu Yanqing, the young owner of Zhenhe Tea Shop on Beishan West Road in Dean Lane, a native of Haining, Zhejiang, was kidnapped by bandits on the evening of September 8th of last year, at 11:00 PM, while riding a chartered car home. They were ambushed at the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao and Minguo Road in the French Concession and hidden at No. 73 Jianye Lane in Fulixieli, attempting to extort a ransom. On the 15th of the same month, the case was solved by the special task force detectives of the French Concession, and the hostage was rescued. The kidnappers, Zheng A'er, Yu Aqing, Tang Afu, Cao Zhangshi (a bandit woman), Qian Taoyuan, Hong A'gen, Lu Yisheng, Wang Ziqing, and Liu Shaoqing, as well as the suspected women Wang Zhangshi and Zhao Liushi, a total of eleven men and women, were arrested at two locations, No. 13 in the same lane. Handguns, bullets, iron chains, eyeglasses, and other items were confiscated. They were sent to the Second Special District Local Court, where presiding judge Luo Renji repeatedly interrogated them. On December 9th, Zheng A'er, Qian Taoyuan, Lu Yisheng, Wang Ziqing, Liu Shaoqing, Yu Aqing, and Hong A'gen were sentenced to death. Tang Afu was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Cao Zhangshi was sentenced to thirteen years of imprisonment. Wang Zhangshi and Zhao Liushi were acquitted and released. The sentences were reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval. Yesterday was the execution date. At 10:00 AM, Judge Zhang Shijie ascended to the execution court, ordered the convicts to be brought to the case, verified their identities, and assigned police officers to escort them to the prison car and transport them to the Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing for execution. The Shanghai Local Court had received notification in advance and appointed prosecutor Shen Zhaoming as the supervising officer, accompanied by a clerk and bailiffs, to attend the scene. When the prisoners arrived, they met with warden Dong Changmin, ascended to the public case, and ordered each convict to be brought to the case, questioned them one by one whether they had any last words. Then the judicial police chief and the police officers led the convicts down to an open space, four in the front and three in the back, and executed them in two batches.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Publication of the Second Report by the Shanghai Consular Body <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Japan Clearly Initiated the Breach of the Ceasefire Agreement</p>
<p>However, the report does not determine responsibility</p>
<p>The Shanghai Consular Investigation Team, composed of the Italian Chargé d'Affaires and the Consuls-General of France, Norway, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain, and cooperating with the US Consul-General, issued its second report on the 12th of this month, which reads as follows:</p>
<p>On the afternoon of January 29th, around 8:00 PM, after the ceasefire had already begun and the sound of guns and cannons had subsided, the next day, the Japanese Naval Commander protested to the American and British Consuls-General, claiming that the armored train stationed at the North Station had reopened fire. This was denied by the Chinese, who stated that the Japanese had fired first.</p>
<p>On the morning of January 31st, seventeen Japanese aircraft flew over Shanghai and Chinese military defense areas, but did not bomb. Japanese naval authorities stated that this demonstration was due to the recent breach of the ceasefire terms by the Chinese, which was solemnly denied by the Chinese. On the same day, all parties discussed the establishment of a neutral zone and decided to continue the ceasefire, pending a response from both sides. This negotiation was mentioned by this group at the end of the first report.</p>
<p>On February 1st, the ceasefire was practically implemented, but some sporadic gunfire occurred from time to time.</p>
<p>On February 2nd, the Japanese commander again stated that the Chinese had violated the ceasefire conditions again yesterday and that the Chinese were clearly assembling troops in preparation to encircle the Japanese army. He dispatched aircraft to investigate. Around 12:00 noon on the same day, several Japanese aircraft flew over Shanghai and the Chinese army's defense area. The Chinese fired at them, and the Japanese aircraft dropped several bombs in Zhabei. Within a short period, gunfire erupted on both sides of the front line. At 3:00 PM, after the resumption of hostilities, the Japanese Consul-General informed the consuls of various countries that the Japanese government had rejected the previously proposed neutral zone.</p>
<p>On the same day, the Mayor of Shanghai sent a note to the consuls of various countries, mentioning the ceasefire agreement signed at the meeting on January 31st, stating that the Japanese had repeatedly violated this agreement and attacked the Chinese army, and had also bombed with aircraft (as described in the above section). This note was received by the consuls of various countries on the 3rd of last month.</p>
<p>On February 3rd, the Japanese naval authorities declared that the Chinese authorities continued to show a lack of sincerity in fulfilling their promises. Therefore, the Chinese army should be ordered to withdraw from Zhabei to a considerable distance. The Japanese side, in order to implement this plan, may have bombed the Chinese lines with its aircraft. Subsequently, the Japanese Consul-General notified the consuls of various countries that three destroyers had been shelled by the Wusong forts. The Japanese decided to occupy the forts. However, the shelling by the Wusong forts was again denied by the Chinese side. Since February 3rd, a state of war has openly existed, and even conditions similar to a ceasefire have completely disappeared. Artillery fire continued intermittently in the Zhabei and Wusong areas, and the Japanese continued to bomb with aircraft. The Japanese admitted that their goal was to capture the Wusong forts and drive the Chinese army far away from Shanghai. Therefore, the offensive was entirely carried out by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Regarding the breach of the ceasefire conditions, it should be noted that a complete state of ceasefire was never actually established, and there were no foreign observers on the front line. It is impossible to judge who should bear the responsibility for the breach. It is possible that isolated troops or troublemakers on both sides were responsible.</p>
<p>In addition to the issue of formal military forces reopening fire on the front line, several incidents occurred within the Japanese-controlled sections of the Public Concession during this period, which are related to the system of the Public Concession and are of important international concern, must be briefly described.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Japanese actions on the night of January 28th, many Chinese soldiers in plainclothes have infiltrated the Japanese sections, either hiding in residential buildings or climbing onto rooftops, and firing at Japanese sentries on the street with handguns. At that time, the Japanese seemed to lack sufficient formal military forces to defend their occupied sections, so they gathered so-called veterans, provided them with firearms. These soldiers also wore plain clothes, but with armbands. Japanese sailors and veterans resisted the Chinese plainclothes troops with guns and searched house to house. During the search, great damage occurred, as these people did not hesitate to set fire to houses in order to drive out the plainclothes troops. At that time, the Hongkou section was completely under the jurisdiction of the Japanese naval authorities. Several streets there had been barricaded, and the police force was disarmed, causing the municipal functions of the Public Concession, including fire fighting, to cease. Communication between the police stations in Hongkou and the General Police Station was also completely cut off. The Municipal Council had no choice but to evacuate schools and hospitals. Japanese sailors, veterans, and other thugs committed many excessive acts, even carrying out executions with simple procedures. These Japanese thugs had no official duties, and their actions were largely a retaliatory measure due to previous anti-Japanese activities by the Chinese, resulting in a phenomenon of terror. Almost all residents other than Japanese fled. Many Chinese disappeared, suspected of being captured and killed by the Japanese.</p>
<p>On February 5th, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession requested the Consular Body to negotiate with the Japanese authorities to investigate this matter. The Japanese Consul-General acknowledged that in the midst of the chaos, the Japanese were emotionally heated and had indeed taken excessive actions, but the situation had greatly improved. He promised to transfer anyone arrested by the Japanese naval authorities within the Public Concession on suspicion to the police station of the Municipal Council. This has already been implemented. However, the number of missing Chinese is still very large. According to a detailed investigation by the police station of the Municipal Council, there are still about 300 cases of missing persons. The actions of the plainclothes troops have greatly decreased, while Japanese surveillance remains strict. The Municipal Council's police force and other municipal functions can only be slowly restored. The Japanese authorities were deeply moved by the excessive behavior of the Japanese and have sent some undesirable elements back to their country. This group does not intend to submit another report for the time being, but if new information is found that requires correcting the previous report, or extending or supplementing the special points contained in the first and second reports, it will be discussed separately.

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Protests Again to the US and UK</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 14th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent identical notes to the US and UK ministers. The following is the full text of the note to the US minister:</p>
<p>"Regarding the matter of the Shanghai Public Concession allowing Japan to use the concession as a military base, this Ministry has already issued notes on January 31st, February 5th, and 6th to stop this and declared that China will not be responsible for accidents that occur in the concession as a result. On February 10th, a reply was received stating that the United States government had instructed its ambassador in Tokyo to urge the Japanese government to order the Japanese military commander in Shanghai to no longer use the Public Concession as a base to attack areas under Chinese jurisdiction, and stating that the contents of the note were of common concern and continued consideration by the United States government and related governments, and that the minister dared to guarantee this. However, according to reports, tens of thousands of Japanese troops landed at various wharves in the Public Concession on the morning of the 14th, and another large batch of Japanese troops may arrive on the 15th, proving that the Japanese government disregards the advice of the United States government, and the Public Concession still shelters the Japanese army and allows it to use the concession as a base to attack the Chinese army. The Chinese government solemnly declares again that if the Japanese army in Shanghai continues to attack areas under Chinese jurisdiction and the Chinese army implements legitimate defense, resulting in loss of life and property in the concession, the Chinese government will not be responsible in any way. In addition to the note to the British minister, a serious protest is hereby lodged, requesting your Excellency to, in accordance with the intentions of your government, investigate the above-mentioned repeated notes of this Ministry, promptly and strictly prevent the Japanese army from using the concession as a base to attack the Chinese army and prohibit the Japanese army from landing at wharves in the concession, so as to avoid disputes, and hoping for a reply. This note is necessary." (Central News Agency, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e72">Call a Special Assembly <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Japan Plans to Protest the Use of Article 15</p>
<p>Dr. Yan Huiqing, the chief Chinese representative in Geneva, now claims that if the Council does not agree to convene the Assembly on its own initiative, he will proceed with his application to convene a special meeting of the League of Nations Assembly to discuss the Sino-Japanese situation, especially the Shanghai incident. The Japanese action is also very clear. The Japanese will object to this move by China on procedural grounds and will protest against the use of Article 15 of the Covenant in this dispute. However, it is rumored that if the League of Nations agrees to China's application to convene the Assembly, the Japanese representative will announce his withdrawal from the League of Nations. The Japanese representative has denied this, saying that if there is a decision regarding the League of Nations Assembly, the decision to withdraw from the League of Nations will be made by the Japanese government. Reuters has learned that although Dr. Yan has been informed that the letter he sent to the Secretariat of the League of Nations yesterday cannot permanently preserve his right to convene the Assembly, it is inaccurate to say that anyone has advised Dr. Yan to withdraw his application or waive China's rights. Dr. Yan's letter, issued before the expiry of the deadline of the 14th, stated that if the Council decides on its own initiative to convene the Assembly, China may not insist on convening it. However, the Council has now decided not to convene it on its own initiative. It is heard that the Council is scheduled to hold a closed-door meeting today, and there may be a public meeting tomorrow. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>Yang Aiyuan Delivers a Speech in Tianjin</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yang Aiyuan arrived in Tianjin on the morning of the 15th from Xuzhou and stayed at the Guomin Hotel. He told reporters that he had met with Mr. Jiang, Mr. Wang, and Mr. Feng in Luoyang, Xuzhou, and Pukou, and that they all shared the same hatred of the enemy and had the same will to resist to the end and had the determination to do so. The Military Commission has divided the country into four major military regions, which is the entire plan for resistance against Japan, with detailed arrangements. Due to military secrets, it is not convenient to report. The report that his 34th Army was departing to resist Japan is not yet true. According to the plan of the Military Commission, the Northeast Army is stationed on the Pingyu Avenue, and the Shanxi Army is stationed on the Cangshi Road. The enemy's deployment has not yet been determined. Mr. Feng is a standing committee member of the Military Commission and will not return north for the time being. When necessary, he will direct the anti-Japanese army. Nanjing's defenses are solid, and if Japan provokes, it will suffer greatly. Now Japan wants to resolve the Shanghai Incident peacefully. Our authorities believe that Shanghai and the Northeast are one matter and cannot be resolved at the same time. After recovering from typhoid fever last year, Mr. Yan suffered from stomach problems again. The doctor ordered him to rest, so he sent Yu to see Jiang Wang. He advocated resistance against Japan. All the Shanxi troops are willing to die for the country and await dispatch. Yu will go to Beiping tomorrow to see Zhang and then return to report. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Feng Yuxiang sent Wang Daoshi to Bing on the 14th to visit Yan and report on Feng's recent situation and the central government's plan against Japan, urging Yan to come out of the mountains and order the Jin army to set off to defend against insults. The Jin army is ready. Yang Aiyuan's troops will start moving immediately. Yan telegraphed the central government to request funds and raw materials to prepare for the start of the military factory.

<p>(Taiyuan) Wang Song telegraphed the Jin Provincial Government, ordering it to quickly tighten its belt, transfer the savings to the Ministry of Military Affairs to supplement military expenses, and order the supply of 5 million catties of military rations.

<p>London's newspapers this morning all carried headlines reporting the news of Japanese troops landing in the Shanghai Public Concession, which proves that the British are very concerned about the hidden crisis in Shanghai. According to a report from the Geneva correspondent of the Huibao, it is now generally recognized that the situation is not only surprising but also embarrassing, especially the "barbaric" demand put forward by Japan for the Chinese army to withdraw 20 miles. The correspondent mentioned the possibility of major countries withdrawing their ambassadors to Japan and said that the United Kingdom cannot take this action without a Cabinet decision. The return of British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon to London can be seen as a sign that he wants full authority so that he can decide his actions when he returns to Geneva this week.

<p>Candidates from Various Parties Make Final Campaign Speeches</p>
<p>(Tokyo) While the Japanese army and navy are invading China, the attention of the Japanese people is also focused on the news of the war. More than 12 million voters in Japan are preparing to hold general elections on Saturday to re-elect 466 members of the Lower House. At the moment, candidates from various parties are engaged in the final campaign speeches, attacking each other's corruption and shortcomings. The ruling party, the Seiyukai, and the opposition party, the Minseito, both claim that they will win the election. Seiyukai President Inukai Tsuyoshi expects that his party will win 225 to 235 seats and can get the help of small parties, and can steadily occupy a majority in the new Diet. Minseito leader Wakatsuki claims that his party can win 230 seats, which is enough to make the Seiyukai government resign and form a new Minseito cabinet. Neutral observers believe that the Seiyukai will have a majority in the Diet with the help of independent members, or even with the support of the Adachi faction. It is heard that the Adachi faction will get 20 to 30 seats in the new Diet. It is widely rumored that Adachi has a secret agreement with the Seiyukai and can get the post of Minister of Home Affairs in the new cabinet in exchange for supporting the government. Historically, the ruling party has always won the election, relying on the manipulation of elections by the governors and police of various prefectures and counties, and the result of victory can almost be guaranteed. Now the Minseito is attacking the Seiyukai for its failure to resign after the Emperor's accident, its greed for power, its destruction of the normal order, and its abolition of the gold standard without reason, which has put the country's finances in a dangerous situation. This move is particularly effective among farmers in rural areas. (Kokumin News Agency, 15th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Stimson has ordered the US Consulate General in Shanghai to provide a detailed report on the incident of the beating and humiliation of US Deputy Consul Lin Huade in Shanghai by Japanese plainclothes troops. Stimson said that this matter should be regarded as the most serious matter since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai. Lin Huade recently went to the Japanese defense zone on important official business and was beaten and humiliated by armed Japanese residents. At the same time, a Chinese American woman, Ms. Yang, was also humiliated by the Japanese. Afterwards, US Consul General Cunningham protested to Japanese Consul Murai, but the Japanese side has not yet responded. US public opinion is extremely concerned about the safety of American people in Shanghai. However, the State Department has instructed the US diplomatic and military leaders in Shanghai to do their best to protect the expatriates and to act expediently to deal with all incidents occurring locally.

<p>General Public Opinion Disapproves of Japanese Military Actions</p>
<p>London – This morning, Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon visited Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald to discuss the situations in Geneva and Shanghai. However, a cabinet meeting will not be held before Wednesday. The general public is uneasy about the actions China will take in Geneva and the offensives the Japanese army will launch in Shanghai. The temporary lull without substantial developments does not offer any comfort. The Manchester Guardian and the Daily Mail are again urging the League of Nations to take a firm stand. The Manchester Guardian stated that the only absolutely clear fact of the Far Eastern incident is that war has broken out in Shanghai, and the Japanese army is using the public concession as a base of operations, despite the Japanese authorities' denial. The Daily Mail acknowledged that if the League of Nations fulfills its responsibilities regarding the Far Eastern incident, Japan will likely withdraw from the League. However, if the League is intimidated by Japan's threat of withdrawal, the League's prestige will plummet. The newspaper believes that world opinion, regardless of Japan's actions, will support the League's actions. London insurance companies are now concerned about the dangers to shipping in Shanghai due to the war. The Woosung lighthouse, necessary for normal shipping, has also been damaged, making it even more reluctant to underwrite war risk insurance for ships and cargo. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

After arriving at the station, a small number remained to guard the station, while the rest disembarked. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Fearless of Enemy Attacks</p>
<p>(Nanjing) – According to observations by foreign military experts in the area, should the Japanese army invade Nanjing, it will face fierce resistance from Chinese troops, just as in Shanghai. Currently, solid defensive structures have been set up along the Yangtze River in Xiaguan, and the garrison is able to fully utilize the sturdy city walls and dangerous mountains and rivers to arrange defenses. There are currently three lines of defense outside the city, with sandbags piled up at the city gates, and trenches dug at key locations. Artillery positions have been installed on the city walls and hilltops, protected by solid walls, enabling the defending soldiers to resist the strong enemy for a long time. Sandbags and barbed wire have been placed near Lion Mountain, and similar defensive works have been built in Pukou across the river. Today, someone inspected various locations and saw that although the number of troops stationed there was not large, they were all fully equipped and ready to go in the nearby camps. Once they receive orders, they can immediately assemble at the defense lines within minutes. Chinese military authorities also declared that they have sufficient troops to resist the enemy's advance, and if Japanese aircraft suddenly attack from the sky, there are also sufficient anti-aircraft guns to cope with the situation.</p>

<p>(Translated Compilation of Japanese Newspapers) (Continued, Part 3)</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Incident, the Japanese government is divided into two factions: 1. The bureaucratic faction, advocating a gradual approach. When Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng's reply was received on January 28, completely acknowledging the five demands, the majority of this faction considered it satisfactory and did not want any more military disasters to occur, which would cause major international disputes. Unexpectedly, the disaster broke out that night. Initially, they thought that the Chinese army could be resolved in one fell swoop and that the situation would not escalate. They were not concerned about it and devoted themselves to the election campaign. 2. The military faction, advocating the conquest of China by force. The main proponents of this faction were Naval Minister Osumi and Army Minister Araki. There are two reasons why they were so determined to use force: First, they were encouraged by Japanese residents in Shanghai; second, they were influenced by Manchuria. Since the Japanese residents seized Manchuria, they have often incited the military to invade Shanghai, believing that Shanghai is the first commercial center in East Asia and the main import port for Japanese trade with China, and that Shanghai is also the starting point for anti-Japanese sentiment. If they want to eliminate anti-Japanese sentiment throughout China, they must first completely occupy Shanghai. Once Shanghai is within our (Japan's) sphere of influence, the anti-Japanese flame will naturally be extinguished. This is not only the unanimous view of all Japanese residents, but also the opinion of those inside the government. Therefore, since the 20th of last month, textile industrialists in Shanghai have convened secret meetings, all opposing the closure of factories. Later, because the government was determined to fundamentally resolve the situation with force, it had to forcibly order some of its citizens (Japanese) to sacrifice their interests. However, the operators of the nine major spinning mills (Naigaiwata, Dai Nippon Spinning, Nichi-Hua Spinning, Yu Feng Spinning, Toa Spinning, Toyota Spinning &amp; Weaving, Shanghai Silk Reeling, Tongxing Spinning) were still hesitant to make any decisions. By the 29th, due to the dangerous situation, they were deeply aware that war was inevitable, and they finally decided to close down completely. (As reported by the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun). As expected, on the evening of the closure, the navy began to mobilize. What is meant by being influenced by the Manchurian problem is the non-resistance on the night of September 18, which resulted in the capture of Fengtian. Those warlords believed that since such a large army in Shenyang did not dare to resist, it would be easy to take Shanghai, where only a small number of troops were stationed. Therefore, no matter how satisfactory the Chinese side's reply was, it was not as appropriate as occupying it by force. This was the predetermined plan of the military faction. Little did they know that things in the world cannot always go as desired. After the Shanghai Incident, the government repeatedly received news of defeats, and resentment grew throughout the country. The international situation was deteriorating day by day. How could a country that called itself a first-class power be willing to submit to a non-ranked China? Therefore, it is still determined to proceed, but it is deeply afraid that the war will escalate and cause intervention by third countries. Therefore, some within the government advocated that a third country come forward to mediate, so as to save face. This is the current situation in which Japan is riding a tiger and cannot get off.</p>
<p>Regarding commodity prices and agricultural products, Japan's national output has already been insufficient to supply demand. Last year, the Hokkaido, Tokaido, and Tosando areas also suffered a bad year. The harvest of agricultural products suddenly decreased. Taking rice alone, the harvest decreased by 12 million koku last year. In addition, the actual harvest of Korean rice in 1931 was 15,873,000 koku, a decrease of 3,377,680 koku compared to the previous year. The actual harvest of Taiwanese rice last year was 3,851,400 koku, also a decrease of 37,478 koku compared to the previous year. Historically, Japan has always relied on foreign rice for regulation. Although the import of foreign rice this year has increased to 657,000 yuan, it still shows a trend of demand exceeding supply, and the situation is chaotic in various places due to famine. For example, on the 3rd of this month, in places like Aomori Prefecture, there were riots due to the issue of relief rice. This Shanghai Incident completely cut off the shipping routes of goods. The two major shipping lanes, Yokohama to Shanghai and Kobe to Shanghai, have stopped transportation. On the one hand, the number of refugees returning to Japan from Shanghai has reached 9,000, and half of the 25,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai are now returning to their country. They also have to rely on their home country for food. In addition, since the outflow of gold is prohibited and exchange rates have plummeted, the commodity price index has gradually risen. According to a survey by the Bank of Japan, the international commodity prices in January were the highest in the world in Tokyo (Tokyo was 126.8, London was 98.8, New York was 86.4, Paris was 41.3, and London, New York, and Paris were all cheaper than in December, only Tokyo rose sharply). The Shanghai Incident has caused rapid changes in exchange rates, financial stagnation, and imbalances in supply and demand, which have caused commodity prices to skyrocket suddenly, similar to the phenomenon during the Great Kanto Earthquake. According to a recent survey by the Bank of Japan, daily necessities such as rice, coal, sugar, soy sauce, eggs, cotton, fish, firewood, wheat, and meat continue to rise in price. If the war is prolonged, there will inevitably be a major panic in society. At present, people are panicking as if a major disaster is about to happen. This is not only the case in Tokyo, but also in Osaka, Kyoto, and all parts of the country.</p>
