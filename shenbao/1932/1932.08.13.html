<p>時評</p>
<h3>國人應注意日方之夾攻形勢　梓</h3>
<p>日來國内政潮汹湧。國人凝集目光於上海北平漢口南京諸地。以緊張之情緒。盼政局之安定。對東北嚴重之外患。似不免稍减其注意之程度。不知敵人方面却乘此時。對我造成來攻之形勢。彼準備與我折衝於國聯大會之松岡洋右。已以旬日之活動。在我東北完畢其重大工作。於前日經由大連返日。而彼新任駐滿特使兼關東軍政長官之武藤信義。則已受日皇之親任。擬於十四日參與東京歡送大會後。挾積極侵略之策以赴遼瀋。敵方已造就外交與實力兩面進攻之基礎我方政局。則正因外患而掀起巨大之波濤。國人試一觀察内外之形勢。能毋憂懼交并而轉移其目光乎。</p>
<p>請先言外交。松岡洋右爲日本著名之（滿洲通）。一二八事變起後。曾兩度到上海。國人當能諗知其爲何如人。彼因準備偕石井菊次郎負出席十一月間國聯大會之艱巨。七月三十日特赴我東北。爲外交上重要之搜訪。以松岡之熟諗我東北情事。而尚須有此一行者。如彼所言。此次國聯大會將爲滿洲問題六十年來之總决算。不得不鄭重其事。也松岡最近之宣傳談話。陳述國聯不致對日有取非常手段之事。認各小國之爭正義爲不足懼勸日人不必輕視國聯。而謂國聯應以解决中國本部爲重要問題。此其外交進攻之陣。容顯然可見。吾以信任國聯爲唯一方針之外交當局。將何恃以求光榮公平之解决。此國人所應早爲注意者也。</p>
<p>日本數閲月來所謂統一滿洲四頭政治之運動。至武藤被任爲駐滿特使兼關東軍政長官而告一結束。武藤者向以軍事參議官兼陸軍敎育總監。日本之重臣也。彼於受日皇親任後。以（此事件之如何解决。不僅有關滿洲國之命運。且有關日本皇國之休戚。足以左右東亞永遠之興廢）數語。表示其使命之重大。歐美各國。誤認日本特使之任命爲外交關係。對此僅就日本承認僞組織問題。提出責問。吾人總核事實。則認武藤軍事政治之使命。實較重於外交。國人頗有認九一八事變爲出於本莊等日軍人之鹵莽行動者。假使此項認識而不完全差誤。則僞組織之成立。不妨視爲日人之試探行。爲而武藤之西行。乃始爲日方之正式動作矣。日方以前在我東北之所作爲。有目共見。其今後之正式動作。凶烈必更甚於前。此吾人尤應注意而加以準備者也。</p>
<p>吾人於此被夾攻之形勢中。勉强談對抗。則向於太平洋會議席上與松岡就滿洲問題爲劇烈對抗之徐淑希氏。近已受出席國聯之顔　慶之邀請。束裝赴日内瓦。助代表團準備應付方法。而東北義勇軍最近之統一行動。冀有以掣武藤之肘。使不得逕意直行。嗚呼。所可視爲對抗行動者。僅此如而已。</p>

<p>路透十一日塞維爾電桑巨爾約所主持之復辟運動旣經失敗、今日共産黨與搗亂者乘機爆亂、將塞維爾最佳俱樂部三所及天生敎復辟黨報館縱火焚燬、而桑將軍之總司令部等亦被搗毁、塞維爾原有之保安隊、因有參加復辟運動嫌疑、現被拘於營中、以待研訊、故城中無充分兵力、事態乃愈嚴重、但有五千兵士刻在柯杜伐待命、如須進援、即可向塞維爾進發、城中商店大都閉門、電車街車皆未行駛、街中除共黨與兵士往來外、幾無行人</p>
<p>路透社十一日瑪德里電西班牙復辟未成、衆料其最大結果、將爲政府之嚴峻取締右翼報紙、虚無黨與共黨或將乘此反動機會、而進行利於左翼工黨之宣傳興登堡主張</p>

<p>路透社十一日柏林電國家社會黨希特勒、衆認爲現無躍爲德總理之希望、因興登堡總統主張内閣組織、必須脫除黨派拘束、而不恃國會之票數也、希氏如欲爲總理、則必向興登堡總統切實擔保不施行國社黨政綱而後可、此種擔保無異賣其黨徒、想希氏必不出此、惟國社黨機關安格立夫報今日聲稱、如希氏不得政府領袖地位、則國社黨必投票反對巴本政府云、觀此則希黨猶未放棄其組閣之决心也、</p>

<p>八十（七十三）唐先生說··（汽車打倒轎子，打不倒獨輪的手車，我承認是事實。但是這個例）子能不能應用到紡織業上去是一個很大的疑問。以紡紗而論·用手工藝紡紗·每人每天多則紡八兩紗，少則紡四兩紗，平均亦不過六兩紗。機器紡紗，每人每天八小時能紡二十磅，效力要大四十倍。有的時候拿紡好的粗紗出賣，還賣不上棉花的價錢。因此與其用自已紡的紗倒不如拿棉花去換機器所紡的紗。手工紡紗之不能抵抗機器紡紗似乎是一個很顯明的事實。手工紡紗好比是轎子而不是手車。機器紡紗便好比是汽車，趕走手工紡紗如同趕轎子一樣，勢必要趕得精光，一個不留。如何還能提倡？）朱先生說·（手工紡紗與機器紡紗單獨作戰，好一比是比利時獨自一個子與德意志開火，難免一敗塗地。但是比利時到今日依然存在，因爲他是與許多國聯合起來幹。我們不是單獨提倡手工紡紗以與機器紡紗奮鬥。如果我們是那樣幹法，自然要失敗無疑。我們所主張的乃是棉業整個生産過程之聯合戰線。從棉花，紡紗，織布一直到做衣服統統是抓在棉花區域的人民的手裏，絲毫不讓外力突破陣線。若是零碎的幹不但是手工紡紗會失敗即手工織布也非失敗不可。你用買來的紗在鄕下織布，每天起早落夜織他丈把賺得拾幾枚銅板，如何可活？但産棉區域整個生産過程之聯合戰線是有勝利之可能。種棉花不賣·省掉棉花運費，免除棉商剥削，紡紗又不賣，省掉棉紗運費，免除布廠剥削，織布自已穿，省掉棉布運費，免除布商剥削，並通盤計算産棉區域外的消費量酌定産布餘額以應需要而免過剩。這樣不是可以立於不敗之地嗎？你講手工紡紗没有機器紡的好却比機器紡的貴是有一半對。專靠手工紡紗過活是活不了。但是我們農人每年是有五個月的空閑。全國有三萬六千萬人住在鄕下，除去老少，至少有二萬萬人是能做充分的生産工作。一匹馬力約等於八匹人力。我們是有二千五百萬匹馬力每年五個月放在那裏不用。機器不用則上銹，人無事做則賭博，抽大烟，無所不爲。機器不開，不必燒煤，人無事做，還要吃飯。中國鄕村裏是有二萬萬匹人力每年，五個月天天燒煤而不工作，這是多麽大的一個浪費呀！現在最新的機器每匹馬力要燒多少煤炭？）唐先生說·（兩磅光景）朱先生說·（我們這二萬萬匹空閑的人力是一磅煤炭也不必加，如果用他紡紗織布，是决不致比機器的出品貴你看呢？）</p>

<p>二一枝譚</p>
<h3>納凉的留聲片</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>水邊林下的納凉者有一口長齋的老太太，有天眞爛縵的三媛，有曾經壯游的張二先生。｜二先生，你是到過口外的，你把口外的奇聞講講。｜三媛，你又要我講野味脚了。我便把蒙古的情形，略談一下子。｜二叔，你是見多識廣的，一肚皮的野味脚，再也講不完。｜老嫂，不要給我戴着炭簍子了。我在蒙古，住過四五年，去的時候，是在淸季，回來的時候，已是民國三年了。中華的國勢，一年不如一年？我在去的時候，蒙古人見了漢人，眞個敬若神明｜只須聽得車輪聲響，便在深夜，那匿居蒙古包的土人，都來歡迓漢賓：把他們所住的生着爐子溫煖宜人的蒙古包，讓給客人住：他們郤躱在客人的車輛底下過夜。待到光復以後，我們回來的時候，蒙古人招待漢人，便没人這般的恭敬：現在呢，更</p>
<p>不必說了！｜二先生，蒙古女人，也似我們這般麽？｜完全不同，蒙古女人終年不洗澡，但是肌膚倒也潔白：爲着常吃羶肉骼漿，肌膚的宿垢，會得引渡到衣服上面，所以肌膚並不十分齷齪，只有這貼肉衫　，又油又膩，髒的不可開交：一身衫褲上面，大約可以提出三斤牛油蠟燭的燃料。三媛，你不要請他講野味脚吧。聽了敎人打噁心：他專揀躐裏躐蹋的講。｜吃長素的老嫂，你是終年凈素，葷腥不上灶，只把蔴菇湯弔弔胃口：老嫂，這蔴菇産在口外，凡是蒙古人把過剩的羶肉骼漿，抛棄在沙土中，這一塊地方，便會産生着蔴菇，須知蔴菇也是躐裏躐蹋的東西。｜三媛，你把中頓剩下的口蔴湯，傾棄在河裏吧：我從此不吃蔴菇了。｜好婆，信他呢：二先生的話，總是半眞半假。</p>
<h3>瀋陽歸客譚</h3>
<p>— 金鳳</p>
<p>表弟陳君。供職於瀋垣北關某號。邇者丁艱南返。東北商市。本悉倚關内人支持。暴日旣佔遼瀋。深慮關内人棄業南返。於是於交通要口。滿佈探捕。舉凡未經滿洲國所委之地方官准許者。槪不准離瀋入關。違者作爲諜探。可處以極刑。故凡欲離瀋者。輒賄賂鑽營。以求一紙通行證。陳君留瀋已五載餘。識得數日本浪人。此輩浪人。今多已爲滿洲國之官吏。知陳君以丁艱回滬。乃爲之謀得一通行證。取道奉山路入關。計自登車以後。以迄山海關。沿途被檢查者凡五次。檢查時必問是何國籍。陳君輒答以滿洲國人。或奉天人。檢查者乃略事搜檢即去。有一同車者。當檢查者詢問國籍時。答以山西人。檢查者大怒。力批其頰。再詢其入關何事。答以回鄕省親。檢查者又批其頰。嗣啓視其行篋。得一函。檢查者翻閲有頃。即揪其衣領而去。且行且以拳猛擊其背。時同車之人。咸戰慄無人色。然同車華人凡七。無有敢略示慍色者。且此七人</p>
<h3>火浴</h3>
<p>— 石·顔·也</p>
<p>浴必以永。人所皆然。不以水而取火。未之前聞也。淞滬之役。十九軍力竭後退。時後方援軍。亦陸續馳至。上官雲相之四十七師。進駐虞山西邑。屯居旣畢。卽紛向民間覓浴池。村落鳥足比都市。民皆或浴於盆。或浴於鍋。（鐵鍋巨大專爲浴用）無公用之池也。彼輩旣不獲池。卽屈從鍋或盆。惟器小不能共浴。人衆乃求過於供。無已。乃購取民柴。爲圍焚之。數十人去衣立其中。受火之薰灸。謂暢適莫倫。是卽火浴也。若曹好浴。蓋亦有故。緣軍費積欠。爲時甚久。偶有發放。數亦微甚。上等兵獲一金。下焉者數角耳。俸且不給。則其服裝自垢敝無新製。旣垢且敝。久無更易。蝨乃叢生。長日困於蝨。其膚自奇　。非浴無以解其苦。其甚者。以撫抓而膚裂。入水奇痛。轉不若灸以火之暢適。故四十七師乃創人間未聞之火浴也中。自始至終。均未敢略作一耳語。蓋每節車中。輒駐有日探一二。僞爲搭客。見華人有互相交談者。即目爲敵探。加以逮捕。陳君言。日人之所最畏者。爲我國之非正規軍。即義勇軍救國軍等是也瀋垣自爲日佔後。極力粉刷太平。然一入晚。則無日不在戒嚴狀態中。佈崗通衢。如臨大敵。九一八後。一二月之間爲尤甚。彼時日韓浪人。輒狂飲以迄午夜。踉蹌而歸。守崗者詢以口令。浪人不知所對而被誤殺者。日必三五人。近以義軍勢盛。風聲鶴唳。瀋垣亦一夕數驚。偶聞槍聲。日僑婦孺。即倉皇奔避。擾攘達旦。即如陳君於奉山路旅程中。車戞然而止者。凡六次。隨車日兵。下車巡視。均無所得。杯蛇市虎。在日人目之。一若義勇軍已佈天羅地網者。狼狽情形。可笑亦復可恨。</p>
<h3>蘇諺詮釋</h3>
<p>— 飯牛翁</p>
<p>諺語方言。隨地因時而異。毋乃渹三字·今日非獨無人說。且無人知其意義矣。吳下古諺最多。蘇行舊府屬九縣。六十四市鄕。（舊九縣名吳·長洲·元和·吳江·震澤·常熟·昭文·崑山·新陽。今則歸併長洲元和入吳縣。歸震澤入吳江。歸昭文入常熟。歸新陽入崑山。）中之古諺。有僅通行於九縣六十四市鄕。而他處無人說。且無一人其意義者。並有如毋乃渹三字之將歸消沉者。暑日如年。庽樓無俚。偶摘眞正蘇州諺語。他處不通行者。一一詮釋。倘亦遊覽虎阜獅林。麋臺鹿苑者之一小助淸興歟。觀音山轎子人抬人觀音山在吳縣境蘇金閻門外三十餘里。春日嬉春仕女。登山遊覽者。雇畫船出城。至山登岸。往往雇山轎。每二鄕人共抬一乘。無三人更換替力者。且有婦女成童亦凑數赚錢。年年二三月。凡山麓居民。恃此收入。爲一歲之開支。而曰人抬人。其意含坐轎是人。抬轎也是人。中有感歎之義。又含禮尚往來之意。南濠彩子北濠燈金昌亭下有南北兩濠。爲蘇城最繁華。市廛櫛比。人烟稠密兩岸店家。鱗次櫛比。各種土産。皆由梯航雲集。前淸乾嘉時代。帝制正盛。每值皇室國慶。美其名曰與民同樂。與濠居户。往往紥紅綠五色綢布綵子。懸掛通衢。任人觀賞。北濠則懸挂各種花燈。并有爭奇誇異。自菱湖聘請名手。專紥新鮮絲綵燈。數日夕不爽。勞民傷財。莫此爲甚。同光後此風闃絕矣。在光緖二十一年那拉后六十歲。尚舉行一次。從此滅矣。</p>
<h3>訓練飛機的新法</h3>
<p>— 高濳</p>
<p>在現代的戰事中。飛機成爲了不可少的武器。淞滬之役。我們尤其是親自感到飛機的需要。大凡抵禦飛機。一方面固然要用高射砲。同時不可不有强力的飛機。和敵方作空中的戰爭。現在訓練飛機空中射擊。有兩個最新奇的方法。使射手能得精確的描準。</p>
<p>第一個方法是英國空軍所用的。係用一根長繩。一端繫一個空袋（和飛機塲上的風筒一般）。一端連在飛機尾巴上。飛機在空中飛。那袋子便遠遠的飄在後邊。於是另一飛機上的射手。便把此袋當作敵人的飛機。向之射擊。又一個方法是美國空軍所用的。係用一根長繩。繫一面大旗。埀在飛機底下。飛機飛時。大旗下面墜有重物。所以只遠遠的懸垂在飛機下面。不會飛起。大旗上面畫有一個大飛機。（和眞的一般大）别一飛機上的射手。便把他當作敵人的飛機。向之射擊。我們檢查大旗上的彈痕。便知射手是否瞄得準確。</p>
<h3>故都聞見錄</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>廣和居廣和居位於城南北半截胡同。肆不甚宏敞。特以歷史蹟見稱。道光初載。海宇承平。民物雍泰。其時京朝簪組之彦。咸寓城南。官政旣閒。紛華未啟。士大夫所以消磨退食光陰者。不外乎數間湫溢樸陋之酒肆。同官知好之娱樂於是。京曹外簡與外官入覲者之酬酢亦於是。</p>
<p>食價旣廉。又無須付現金。雖至年節索賬。亦僅償其少而不必全付。此據肆中老傭所說）故人咸稱便。竈溫沙鍋居同爲北平古肆也。而彼之顧客爲王孫惡少。則名不雅馴。不爲撍紳先生所道。無能以證史跡。此之顧客爲京曹官。京曹官多文學之士。由此遂騰之詩什。駸駸與汴京之樊樓頡　史乘矣。夏孫桐感舊詩注有云。道光以來名士文酒之會。接跡於此。何子貞先生居苊南。直以爲外庖。詩孫觀察嘗與論四世之交。言舊債上溯六七十年。亦不相計論矣。廣和居之所以重於一時。更以其能代表南人居北勢力。大抵北人之勢力瀰漫於内城。起居服御飲饌之風尚。且有與南人始終格格不入者。南人雖北。而必自成一種社會。自保一種風尚。自植一種勢力。昔王肅不飮乳酷。（見洛湯伽藍記）而毛修之能爲南人飲食。（見魏書本傳）知南北飲饌之殊風。自古不免。迄於今日。南食遂喧賓奪主。此雖區區一節。而廣和居之關係南北勢力消長之機。不可謂不巨矣。肆中最膾炙人口之南肴。曰潘魚吳魚江豆腐韓肘陶菜。夏氏感舊詩注并詳及之。烹炙多傳自南士。或標其姓氏。潘魚者耀如太史炳年也。吳魚者潤生中書均金也。江豆腐者韻濤太守澍　也。近日韓力畬部郎授以鍋燒豬肘。亦足追配。號曰韓肘。昔陶鳧薌侍郎有淸蒸肚塊。號曰陶菜。不始於廣和居。今獨留遺製。他家皆絕響矣。五柳魚卽宋嫂遺法。廣和居之營業狀况具於歷年册籍。細加檢閲。知其股東爲山東申姓。人口甚多。須一一均分。下至店傭。亦須按股分息。亦百年中經濟制席之可研究者也。錄左列一段以槪其他。庖人孫積　同治四年起身。股一成四厘五。若賺錢少。按一百五十千。不爲長支。工資六千。五年分二十三千四百零四文。六年分三十千九百零五文。雇主與傭工之關係如此。殆亦所由能歷久不敝也。今舖掌郭春華。出身學徒。親覩數十年中變化。堅苦之餘。益以精厲。雖當舊京墟莽之日。或終能支柱其間。不負創業垂統者之苦心也。當創肆之初。僅有今之門屋。其後屢加充拓。始具規模。然大抵猶是百年舊風。據郭君所談。燭奴易爲電炬。錫盎代以　拌。皆彼親見。試出其故器陳而觀之。眞如溫夢。蕞爾一肆。而百年間陳跡。歷歷可尋。攄蓄念而發幽情。舍此更何之矣。</p>

<h3>洋米晨跌午漲</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、上午開市甚軟、客户去胃尤呆、祗由本街鄕莊應酬小絞米七百包、市價將有回跌近角之象、蓋客化邇日本無大批去化、前日得雨後、各地人心一致向下、南京帮本有大批去胃、因天雨停手、其他客户更多觀望、不料午後忽有鄕户到申問訊、該户久未到市、開手卽辦小絞五百包、行情照市放大近角、因此引起其他　鄕莊及本街購買、市面亦轉站勢、全日開出小絞一千五百包、價九元五角、及五角二分、高至七角、陳小絞九元二角七分至二角二分、又西貢一號二百包、價十元○一角半、</p>
<h3>粉市跌後轉挺</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後各月份呈初跌繼俏之象、開價時因洋麥報價小二三角左右、業外人心、未免疲寂、兼之福新阜豐等、仍陸續暢出故最低時較前日曾跌二分左右、惟以後因山東及南洋帮、近遠各期均有收買、數量頗旺、因此軟弱之局又立轉昂挺且以金價低而復高、匯率又有變動、所以後步情形、當看國外之眞確情形再定升沉也、結果本月份較前日小五厘、九十十一月份各反好五厘、十二月份小二厘半、一月份未動云、</p>
<h3>期麥平庸</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平穏盤旋之象、以洋麥報價雖小二三角、惟金價低而復抬、仿彿無所出入、至盛傳廠家續定洋麥、尚屬似是而非、不過廠家方面、大致非定不可、至國内情形、終覺無可再廉、因此人心雖平、内地賣氣、不能轉暢也、結果八月份較前日小三分、九月十二月份小二分、十月份小一分、餘未動、現麥市面、依然平定、到銷均未大暢、開蓬萊麥二百餘包、價三兩三錢五分云、</p>

<h3>琳丁丁</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>琳丁丁係美國電影界著名犬星，每奏妙技，見者爲之絕倒，因此美國新聞，爲報告名犬之死耗，曾載篇幅，有半頁之多，則該犬星之足以顚倒人羣，其魔力於此可見。嘗聞美女敎士蜜司宋言，余已多年不回國，去年返國，一覩情形，深爲浩歎，非特各種生活，程度日高，而奢侈淫蕩之風，亦大非昔比，以後我不願回國云云，此雖係敎士之言，其頭腦畢竟較爲恬淡淸靜，觀察點自然迴殊，惟美國近來奢侈淫樂之風，日甚一日，而失業無聊之民日多，此是無可諱言之事實。　　惟當前之經濟問題，爲世界空前之恐怖潮流，任何一國，莫不感受痛苦，而一般野心勃勃的帝國主義者，又欲乘隍阢不安的狂濤中，不顧一切，擴張其殖民勢力，無論何國人民，不當再消磨於酣歌恒舞之中，應該移轉其目光與腦筋，注射於世界大勢國本要圖，犬星雖明，不應再爲之鋪張揚厲，極力鼓吹。這些話我對於美國人説，是絕對不倫，應爲我是中國人，所謂（養媳婦做媒人，自顧不周，）根本上無批評的資格，美國人雖驕奢淫逸，然其對於科學軍備，依舊日漸發明，日有進步，而我國所得到的，無非摹仿歐美之皮毛，驕</p>
<p>奢淫逸的態度，此外尚有什麽呢。我國驕奢淫逸的風尚，雖非盡傳於美國，然至少亦傳染其一部份，即如好萊塢之影片公司，規模何等偉大，其所出産之著名影片，風行全球，則其每年吸收世界之金錢，其數量亦可想見，故美國一方面雖提倡奢侈，而又一方面，仍是吸收世界經濟的一種方法，則該犬星之在電影界中，樹了驚人的偉績，其悼惜亦是應該。試觀中國之犬如何，不數日前，亦發現了駭人聽聞的舉動，曰人狗相交，同是狗也，一則如彼，一則如此，人之罪歟，犬之罪歟。</p>

<h3>琺瑯器皿之製造及組合</h3>
<p>— 張陵洲</p>
<p>頃閲沈敏先生之（琺瑯製品淺說）一文，略與事實欠符，在下以日處於琺瑯廠製造方面之間，願以平日耳聞目睹爲讀者諸君一述。製造琺瑯器皿，其方法及手續依照下列分别陳之。Ａ坏子方面（一）生坏，以市所購之鋼片ＳｈｅｅｔＳｔｅｅｌ（俗曰黑鐵皮），用人工或機械之力形成種種色樣，稱之謂生坯，（二）將成形之生坯，投入稀硫酸内，以去鋼片上足以阻碍與琺瑯結合之雜質，惟此時應注意鋼片上之硫化物，蓋鋼片浸於硫酸内。易生硫酸　。此項合化物足以破壞琺瑯器皿而有餘。Ｂ瑯粉組合及搪粉瑯粉爲以各項礦石及養化原料依照成份配合而成，其性質屬大半爲鐮性（Ａｌｋａｌｌ）當將各原料合配混合後，置於高熱之爐灶中，使之液化，再激於水中，而成結晶狀，再將此項結晶狀置於磨Ｍｉｌｌ中，混之以水，磨成漿狀，然後可供搪用，（一）底色Ｇｒｕｎｄ爲浸過稀硫酸之坯子第一次搪上之瑯粉。凡無論何色瑯粉之下，均有底色以爲媒介，因其有與鋼片密切結合之組合也，同時底色爲操琺瑯業者，最難解决之問題，蓋鋼片與底色經高溫度之焙燒後，各有其物理上之伸展性（Ｅｘｐａｎｓｉｏｎ），務必使之相當，否則必有爆裂之虞，其成份如下，Ｏ·５Ｎａ２Ｏ　Ｏ·５Ｂ２Ｏ３Ｏ·２Ｋ２Ｏ　Ｏ·Ｉ５ＡＬ２Ｏ３　２·ＯＳ·Ｏ２Ｏ·３ＣａＯ　Ｏ·ＩＦ２（二）照粉ＣｏｖｅｒｉｎｇＥｎａｍｅｌ爲照於底色之瑯粉也，普通均須二次，否則其色不鮮，其溫度與伸展性相當於底色，白</p>
<p>色照粉成分如下式。Ｏ·４５Ｎａ２Ｏ　Ｏ·Ｉ５　Ｂ２Ｏ３Ｏ·Ｉ５Ｋ２Ｏ　Ｏ·５５ＡＬ２Ｏ３　Ｏ·ｏｏＳｉＯ２Ｏ·４ｏｍｇＯ　Ｏ·３ｏＳｎＯ２常人每云瑯粉中含有鉛質Ｐｂ者·不適於衛生，然下列之方程式中，雖有鉛質，匪特無碍衛生，抑且毫無毒質在也。</p>

<h3>改良吃飯問題之管見</h3>
<p>— 振正</p>
<p>日來關於改良吃飯問題之意見，本刊屢見登載，然所論者，輙斤斤於共食分食制度，窮加研討，對於此外之種種利弊，須待改良者尚多，則未見有人加以討論，人爲雜食動物，不宜於祗食一種穀類，吾人雖有數　之肴菜以佐膳，考其實在，乃以穀類爲本，其餘肴菜，不過取其滋味以誘進穀類耳，猶之啜藥者以糖過口也，無論其所得之營養料之不足。而南方食米之人，甚且因之致病，蓋食米中之銀皮酸，（即維他命）已早爲輾礱淘洗，失去凈盡，况米中所含之於吾人營養上所不可或缺之蛋白質，祗占百分之·六·麥麵中所含者·則有百分之一·七超過約有一倍强·吾國人人種衰弱·其原因固多·而於飲食營養不之注意，實爲其絕大病根，試觀東西各國食米之邦之人民，必較食麥之邦之人民爲弱，單食一種穀類之人，必較雜食果蔬乳卵等之人爲赢，可以明證，故愚見以爲改良吃飯問題，必先自改食麥食雜食始，此不但於營養經濟諸有裨益，抑且於農村經濟國家財政，得以調劑及充裕，蓋吾國種麥之區，幾遍全國，以南方人不喜食麥，故其値甚賤，本之穀賤傷農，穀貴害民之旨，吾國適兩民，俱遭危害，而失其持平之道，保健之方，至於共食，在現代病菌學昌明以後，急宜加以廢除，本無疑義，而分食制度，如照西人之宴會時派定食法，又於手續經濟以及各人食量方面，似皆有未盡善之處，實則西人亦感覺派定食法之不便，於尋常膳餐時，已早屏除此法，而採用每人多備潔淨之空盆匙叉，各三五事，而將所有肴饌羹炙，另器置之桌中，每人先取盆叉，叉取麵包數塊，一按各人之食量自取，再以一盆取湯食之，食盡再以盆取菜食之，食盡再易一盆，取其他各菜，簡言之即每取一菜，必易一盆，如此則旣免直接間接之傳染病菌，又覺對於手續食量之經濟，各方面均稱便利，此法吾人不難仿效，而亦不妨仿效之，至各派定食法，不但吾人厭其麻煩，即西人亦皆厭其麻煩，蓋於禮儀所系，不得已而行之，吾人若行仿效，不啻效人之短棄已之長矣，</p>
<h3>學堂寫眞</h3>
<h3>暑期學校生意不興隆的原因</h3>
<p>— 阜民</p>
<p>那天我和一個在Ｓ校的朋友談話，談起他們的暑期學校，他說：（今年生意不興隆，校長先生在那裏搖頭呢！）至於爲什麽不興隆？推其原因，第一，（戰後經濟衰落，主顧｜補習學生｜减少，）第二，（同業增多，供過於求。）因爲暑期學校是補習性質，所以不必領什麽開業證（立案），而各校的老闆和夥計們都想利用這機會撈些外快，於是暑期學校像雨後春筍一般挿滿全市了，但是顧客有限，因此生意淸淡，</p>
<p>第三，（老闆們祇知道（仿造），（假冒），（搶生意），不知道在貨物上改良）</p>
<p>，黨義敎員敎數學，英文敎員敎化學，當然他們的貨識是可想而知的不妙了，　　第四，（夥計們不會做生意（就是不會迎合客人們的心理）），顧客們當然以愈節省他們的開支愈好，買書最好不買，用講義，可以一毫不費而得幾張紙，可是碰到幾位不會做生意的夥計，不高興或是不會編講義，那祇有呌顧客們化錢買書了，最可笑有一個夥計覓會選出一本八塊錢的書來，顧客們聽了那得不</p>
<p>聞風而逃呢，</p>
<p>Ｓ校幸而還有（三七主義）中的第三（七）來支撑着前二（七），可是比了往年相差多了，</p>
<p>談天說地</p>
<h3>酒樓中</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>李老闆今天請客，爲了他第二個孩子的彌月。用不着說，這個酒樓是如此寛大，而且墻壁上滿掛着（生財有道）（利達三江）的玻璃鏡框，一切都顯得富</p>
<p>麗堂皇，至少對於在座的李老闆的客人，總算是非常相稱的。</p>
<p>菜已上了五六樣，李老闆在這裏殷勤自敬了一會酒便到别桌去了。當然主人一走，有的客人覺得可以略事放縱，於是一陣（五魁）（八馬）之後，京莊紹興</p>
<p>又去了整整的一壼，結果大家臉上都覺着熱烘烘，精神飽滿，以至談笑風生。起初是醬油店的老闆在訴苦似的說明（生意眞是不容易做；店面上是三個夥計兩個徒弟，單就工錢說每月就得二十八元大洋，再加上兩個學徒的二元二角五分，還要吃飯，還要電燈，還要巡捕捐；可是每天的生意却只有二百元上下，結算起來每個月只有一百多元好賺，這對於····意思是說這對於自已的鴉片癮確是不易於維持，不過大家又談到國家大事上去了，所以對於這醬油老闆的下文也就不大注意。</p>
<p>（小菜塲擺滿了舶來品鹹魚，可見ＸＸ貨已大批進口了。）這是那穿着小紡褂褲的年靑人說的。接上是秃頭大胖</p>
<p>子嘆一氣說：</p>
<p>（無論那什麽團什麽團利害，始終是多此一舉；譬如說那個姓惲的，爲着别人的事體，犯得着自已去坐牢嗎？）　　（怪也難怪），這是那秃頭對面的聲音：（張學良始終不抵抗，那能敎年靑人不生氣呢？）</p>
<p>（是的呀，汪精衛又辭職了，所以中國人的事到底是弄不好的。）這又是秃頭的聲音。</p>
<p>（大家都不講義氣，眞是没有辦法，假如中國都能像關羽一樣：）另外一個蓄有三髭鬚的老年人，指着壁上的關聖帝君的容相說：（那便有道理了。現在弄得一團糟，正是因爲中國没有第二個關爺出世的原故。）</p>
<p>（可不是麽），又是一種聲音：（假如我還年輕的話，我一定不做生意，將一點本錢存到外國銀行去，然後去投東北義勇軍！）</p>
<p>烟紙店的陸老闆的這幾句話，在他自已當然以爲是（平心之言），然而却不提防反使那小紡的年靑人嗤的一聲笑了出來。</p>
<p>菜仍是繼續的端上來，現在是一大盆淸燉鴨，上面還擺了紅絲和香菰，一股熱的香味直刺入每一個人的鼻官，於是雜亂的筷箸聲和着無韻律的咀嚼聲，代替了這高談闊論。</p>

<h3>国人应注意日方之夹攻形势　梓</h3>
<p>近日国内政潮汹涌。国人凝集目光于上海北平汉口南京诸地。以紧张之情绪。盼政局之安定。对东北严重之外患。似不免稍减其注意之程度。不知敌人方面却乘此时。对我造成夹攻之形势。彼准备与我折冲于国联大会之松冈洋右。已以旬日之活动。在我东北完毕其重大工作。于前日经由大连返日。而彼新任驻满特使兼关东军政长官之武藤信义。则已受日皇之亲任。拟于十四日参与东京欢送大会后。挟积极侵略之策以赴辽沈。敌方已造就外交与实力两面进攻之基础。我方政局。则正因外患而掀起巨大之波涛。国人试一观察内外之形势。能毋忧惧交并而转移其目光乎。</p>
<p>请先言外交。松冈洋右为日本著名之（满洲通）。一二八事变起后。曾两度到上海。国人当能稔知其为何如人。彼因准备偕石井菊次郎负出席十一月间国联大会之艰巨。七月三十日特赴我东北。为外交上重要之搜访。以松冈之熟稔我东北情事。而尚须有此一行者。如彼所言。此次国联大会将为满洲问题六十年来之总决算。不得不郑重其事。也松冈最近之宣传谈话。陈述国联不致对日有取非常手段之事。认各小国之争正义为不足惧。劝日人不必轻视国联。而谓国联应以解决中国本部为重要问题。此其外交进攻之阵。容显然可见。吾以信任国联为唯一方针之外交当局。将何恃以求光荣公平之解决。此国人所应早为注意者也。</p>
<p>日本数阅月来所谓统一满洲四头政治之运动。至武藤被任为驻满特使兼关东军政长官而告一结束。武藤者向以军事参议官兼陆军教育总监。日本之重臣也。彼于受日皇亲任后。以（此事件之如何解决。不仅有关满洲国之命运。且有关日本皇国之休戚。足以左右东亚永远之兴废）数语。表示其使命之重大。欧美各国。误认日本特使之任命为外交关系。对此仅就日本承认伪组织问题。提出责问。吾人总核事实。则认武藤军事政治之使命。实较重于外交。国人颇有认九一八事变为出于本庄等日军人之卤莽行动者。假使此项认识而不完全差误。则伪组织之成立。不妨视为日人之试探行。而武藤之西行。乃始为日方之正式动作矣。日方以前在我东北之所作为。有目共见。其今后之正式动作。凶烈必更甚于前。此吾人尤应注意而加以准备者也。</p>
<p>吾人于此被夹攻之形势中。勉强谈对抗。则向于太平洋会议席上与松冈就满洲问题为剧烈对抗之徐淑希氏。近已受出席国联之颜惠庆之邀请。束装赴日内瓦。助代表团准备应付方法。而东北义勇军最近之统一行动。冀有以掣武藤之肘。使不得迳意直行。呜呼。所可视为对抗行动者。仅此如而已。</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<p>Accepting the Next Presidential Candidate</p>
<h3>Hoover Announces Important Political Platform</h3>
<p>Foreign Policy: Uphold the Kellogg-Briand Pact, Promote World Peace, Oppose Canceling War Debts, Explore Other Compensation Methods; Domestic Policy: Revise Prohibition, Listen to the Autonomy of Various States, Maintain Protective Tariffs, Strive to Balance the Budget.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, November 11 – President Hoover delivered a speech today accepting the Republican Party's nomination as a presidential candidate, announcing policies characterized by the United States' firm adherence to the implications of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. President Hoover stated, "In times of emergency, we must discuss with other countries in the spirit of this treaty to promote world peace, rather than conclude agreements that bind us to future actions or force us to use force to maintain peace. Most importantly, we have proposed a new doctrine, that we will never recognize ownership of land obtained in violation of the peace treaty. This doctrine has been accepted by countries around the world in a recent important event." President Hoover opposed canceling war debts but hoped that debtor countries would greatly reduce military spending to ease their burden. Hoover also said, "If we contribute other obvious compensation methods for any special payments, such as the expansion of the U.S. goods market and the restoration and maintenance of U.S. prosperity, then I know the American people will definitely consider this kind of proposal." President Hoover mentioned the prohibition of alcohol and advocated for each state to govern themselves, but with the guarantee that bars would not be reopened. President Hoover advocated maintaining protective tariffs and opposed the Democratic Party's proposal to compete with tariffs to increase revenue. Other political platforms announced by Hoover included: (1) Limiting foreign immigration; (2) National defense with security as the first priority; (3) Improving banking laws; (4) Balancing the budget. In his speech, Hoover said that Europe should be responsible for the economic recession. Hoover also mentioned the inherent poisonous spring of political unrest in the peace treaty. Last year's European financial panic hindered the recovery of the United States. We have reversed the trend of Germany's collapse and now propose a reduction of 100 million yuan in global warship expenditures each year. We are now participating in the work of the World Conference to seek the restoration of international economic organizations.</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Supports Stimson's Remarks</h3>
<p>Recognizes Non-Aggression Pact as Having Mandatory Conditions</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, December 12 – Herriot told people today that he agrees with Stimson's remarks regarding the Kellogg-Briand Pact. He welcomed Stimson's view that the pact contains the intention of international consultation when necessary. France deeply knows that for the sake of peace, it is impossible to only view this pact as containing goodwill, but it must be regarded as a mandatory treaty. Most importantly, except for legitimate defense, this pact should be recognized as having the unrestricted effect of binding each signatory country. The problem that needs to be solved now is the procedure to prevent the hands that destroy this solemn task.</p>
<h3>United States Monitors the Development of the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, November 11 – New York sources confirmed the reasons and content of Japanese Ambassador Debuchi's meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, as reported by the London Times this morning, and learned that Debuchi explained that Japan's new appointee, Muto, the highest Japanese diplomatic and military representative in the three northeastern provinces, will be under the control of the prime minister instead of the Ministry of the Army. According to the Baltimore Sun, the U.S. State Department is closely monitoring the situation but does not believe that the Japanese Ministry of the Army will no longer dominate the three northeastern provinces. Stimson's remarks have been praised by public opinion everywhere, so the saying that Japan is preparing to protest to the United States from Tokyo is not easily believed by the public.</p>
<h3>Debuchi Reports on Meeting with Stimson</h3>
<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, December 12 – Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, visited U.S. Secretary of State Stimson on the 10th and exchanged views on the so-called aggressor issue in Stimson's speech. Today, he reported the results of the meeting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During the meeting, Stimson explained that (1) the United States does not have the ambition to be a competitor with Japan in Manchuria; (2) only maintaining the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty as prerequisites, so these words may stimulate Japanese public opinion, but there is no other intention in this, so please understand; (3) the sentence "aggressor" has an indefinite article, which is abstract and does not refer to Japan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that although Stimson's speech was not malicious, he wanted to use it for domestic political relations, regardless of international relations. This kind of slip of the tongue is extremely imprudent and still thinks the explanation is insufficient.</p>
<p>The Adachi Faction</p>
<h3>Urges Recognition of Puppet Organization</h3>
<p>Sending an Envoy Has Nothing to Do with Recognizing the Puppet State</p>
<p>Military Leaders Angry at Foreign Minister Uchida's Slip of the Tongue</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, December 12 – Adachi will organize a new political party called the National League, and he has now gathered thirty comrades. Today, Adachi met with Prime Minister Saito and Army Minister Araki, asking them to immediately recognize (Manchukuo) in accordance with the resolution passed by the Seiyukai in the previous parliament. It is heard that Araki replied that he thinks the time for recognition is now ripe. Although Japan will not recognize (Manchukuo) before the League of Nations' investigation team's report is released, according to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tonight, it may be recognized before the League of Nations General Assembly convenes because (1) the Japanese government now believes that the investigation team will definitely not advocate that the Sino-Japanese dispute be resolved through direct negotiations; (2) although the Japanese government has resolved not to protest to the United States regarding Stimson's speech, the speech has aroused Japanese public opinion, and the public may force the government to take action.</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, December 12 – Because of the so-called unification of the four political heads of Manchuria and Mongolia, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was questioned by our country and various countries. Foreign Minister Uchida replied that the plenipotentiary ambassador has nothing to do with recognizing the puppet state. Military leaders were very angry at his words, so they colluded with the heads and section chiefs of the Ministry of</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Foreign Affairs and the military to jointly submit the so-called (Major Petition), demanding a reply within a week. Since receiving the position on the 28th of last month, Foreign Minister Uchida has ignored it. It is heard that the content is to require the foreign minister to immediately implement the key points of the countermeasure policy for the Manchuria-Mongolia situation related to the Inukai cabinet's policy, which is a policy drafted by the military and approved by the cabinet, forcing the foreign minister to immediately declare recognition of the puppet state. The foreign minister adopted a wait-and-see policy, such as the League of Nations report being unfavorable to Japan, immediately declaring recognition of the puppet state. The military asserted that it would sever ties with the League of Nations, regardless of being the public enemy of the world. If the foreign minister does not comply, then let Muto make arbitrary decisions to force the government to yield. However, the deadline for the reply was September 3rd. Foreign Minister Uchida did not submit a cabinet resolution, nor did he reply to the Japanese military's means of coercing the government, which is very noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Dignitaries Give Farewell Banquet for Muto</h3>
<p>Uchida Bestows Diplomatic Secrets</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, December 12 – Today, Prime Minister Saito and other Japanese dignitaries hosted a banquet to see off the new Commander Muto. After the banquet, Foreign Minister Uchida had a separate secret talk with Muto for forty-five minutes, bestowing diplomatic secrets.

<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, December 12 – The Toyama Prefectural Government asked the people to build an airfield with civilian labor, and they have donated the required funds and land.

The hangar can accommodate forty to fifty large aircraft. Toyama Prefecture faces the Sea of ​​Japan and is opposite Vladivostok, Russia, making it an important location for military operations against Russia.</p>
<h3>Factories Busy Rushing to Manufacture Military Equipment</h3>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, December 12 – The Japanese Ministry of the Navy requested the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds for the manufacture of military equipment, saying that the international situation is very urgent. If they do not accelerate the manufacture of military supplies, it may be too late. It can also be said to be a supplement to helping unemployed workers. They requested that the budget for the 1933 fiscal year be used for the manufacture of military equipment. Although it has not passed the National Assembly's review next spring, the Ministry of Finance agreed in the name of continuing the undertaking. The Japanese military factories have been very busy manufacturing weapons of mass destruction in recent days.</p>
<h3>Mussolini</h3>
<h3>Replaces Ambassadors to Five Countries</h3>
<p>Adopts a Rotation System for Appointments</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, December 12 – Prime Minister Mussolini suddenly dismissed the ambassadors to Washington, Paris, Berlin, Brussels, and Madrid today and appointed five new personnel to replace them, with Rosso as ambassador to the United States, Morano as ambassador to France, Cerutti as ambassador to Germany, Le Royer as ambassador to Belgium, and Quariglia as ambassador to Spain.</p>
<p>National Society, Paris, December 12 – Italian Prime Minister Mussolini published an article in today's commemorative weekly, explaining the reason for the recent change of cabinet members in Italy, saying that one of the common problems of democratic politics is that it is not easy to find suitable talents to handle a difficult career. No one can deny that the election system cannot be regarded as an appropriate method of (choosing people for the job). Therefore, the Fascist government adopts a rotation system for appointments, so that new blood is constantly injected into the country's organism to consolidate its foundation, while at the same time allowing old blood to recuperate and be updated. The result can be to create a group of talented people with good experience in governing the country.</p>
<p>The Memel Case</p>
<h3>Hague Court Announces Verdict</h3>
<p>Dismissal of Chief Executive Officer Justified</p>
<p>Dissolution of Parliament Was Indeed Illegal Action</p>
<p>National Society, Hague, November 11 – The case of the four countries of Britain, Italy, France, and Japan accusing the Lithuanian government of violating the Memel Convention has been announced by the International Court of Justice today. Its judgment was passed by a majority of ten votes to five.

It is now recognized that the dismissal of Memel Executive Committee Chairman Porter and the appointment of Lithuanian Schmittis as his successor can be done in the environment at the time. However, the Governor's dissolution of Parliament on March 22 was an illegal act. The five judges who opposed this resolution were from Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Cuba.</p>

Order has now been restored throughout the country. Traffic that was cut off during the Seville riots has been restored. A large number of troops are now advancing towards Seville, but it is expected that the war is in danger because the restoration movement has disintegrated after San's capture.</p>
<p>Reuters, Seville, November 11 – After the failure of the restoration movement led by Sanjurjo, the Communist Party and rioters took the opportunity to riot today, setting fire to the three best clubs in Seville and the pro-Catholic restoration party newspaper, and also destroying General San's headquarters. The original security team in Seville, because they were suspected of participating in the restoration movement, are now being detained in camps pending investigation, so there are insufficient troops in the city and the situation is becoming more serious. However, there are five thousand soldiers waiting for orders in Cordova, and they can advance towards Seville if reinforcements are needed. Most of the shops in the city are closed, and trams are not running. There are few pedestrians in the streets except for communists and soldiers coming and going.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, November 11 – The failure of the Spanish restoration is expected to have the greatest result in the government's severe crackdown on right-wing newspapers. Nihilists and communists may take advantage of this backlash to carry out propaganda that benefits the left-wing Labor Party. Hindenburg Advocating</p>
<h3>New Cabinet Not Bound by Parties</h3>
<p>Must Still Maintain a Transcendent Nature</p>
<p>National Society, Berlin, December 12 – National Socialist Party leader Hitler arrived in Berlin today, and the political world was once again shocked. Hitler may meet with Prime Minister von Papen tomorrow, followed by an audience with the President, but it is said that President Hindenburg still does not agree with Hitler forming a cabinet, advocating that the cabinet retain its transcendent nature as before after reorganization.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, November 11 – Hitler of the National Socialist Party is considered to have no hope of becoming the German Prime Minister because President Hindenburg advocates that the cabinet organization must get rid of party constraints and not rely on the number of votes in the parliament. If Hitler wants to be Prime Minister, he must give President Hindenburg a concrete guarantee that he will not implement the National Socialist Party's platform. This kind of guarantee is equivalent to selling out his party members. It is thought that Hitler will definitely not do this. However, the National Socialist Party's organ, Angriff, stated today that if Hitler does not get the position of government leader, then the National Socialist Party will vote against the von Papen government. Judging from this, the Hitler Party has not yet given up its determination to form a cabinet.</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Announces</h3>
<p>Documents of Requisitioning Funds</p>
<p>Details of the Railway Department's Appropriation</p>
<p>The Process of Requisitioning Assistance from Rehe</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Mr. Zhang Xueliang hosted a press conference on the evening of the 8th, providing a detailed report on requesting the central government to subsidize 5 million yuan for the financial affairs of North China, requesting the Ministry of Railways to raise 2 million yuan, and requesting assistance of 3 million yuan from Rehe. Mr. Zhang has now also released the relevant documents and telegrams of the above negotiations, so that the public can know the origin of this matter. All documents and telegrams, except for the Beiping Political Affairs Committee's declaration, which has already been published in the newspaper, are recorded below:</p>
<p>1. The Process of Requesting the Ministry of Railways to Lend and Allocate 2 Million Yuan (1) Zhang to Song Ziwen Telegram, Urgent, Immediate, Nanjing Minister Song Ziwen Brother Jian, My place previously ☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐, now the price is still short of 2 million yuan, ☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐, the situation of exhaustion here has long been known, the loan from the bank has not yet been agreed. It is now found that there are still savings in the Beining Railway Bureau. Please ask Brother to dredge Minister Gu Mengyu, and allow us to temporarily borrow 2 million from the Beining Bureau to solve the urgent need. If the Ministry of Railways insists on refusing, or negotiates with the Ministry of Railways to transfer it to your ministry, and then transfer it to us, it is also possible. As a last resort, I have to ask my brother to find a way to raise 2 million yuan. This time, I purchased military supplies, ☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐, ☐☐☐☐, and have already paid two batches of prices. If the final payment is stopped, causing us to fail to fulfill the contract, the goods will not be delivered, and it is a pity to watch the loss. My brother loves his younger brother, and I believe he will not sit idly by. I am very anxious, and the date is only a few days away. I think my brother knows very well the credit that should be observed in transactions. What to do, waiting for a telegram, Your brother Zhang Xueliang. (2) Song Ziwen replied to Beiping Director Zhang Hanqing Brother Jian, I have received your telegram. The matter of borrowing railway funds to purchase machinery is being discussed in detail with the Ministry of Railways. I would like to report this first. Your younger brother Song Ziwen.</p>
<p>(3) Zhang again sent a telegram to Song Ziwen, Urgent, Immediate, Nanjing Minister Song Ziwen Brother Jian, I have received your telegram. I am very grateful for your attention. However, ☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐, is now due, and it is related to external credit, so it cannot be delayed too much. I am extremely anxious, and I hope my brother will complete it as soon as possible to avoid losses. I sincerely hope, Your brother Zhang Xueliang.</p>
<p>(4) Song's second reply telegram to Beiping Director Zhang Hanqing Brother Jian, I am honored to receive your telegram, borrowing 2 million yuan from the Beining Railway, and I have discussed it with President Wang, and Minister Gu Mengyu has ordered the bureau to allocate the amount to your brother. I would like to report this. Your younger brother Song Ziwen.</p>
<p>(5) Zhang to Wang Zhaoming Telegram Nanjing Executive Yuan President Wang Cijian, I recently received a telegram from Minister Song Ziwen saying that you have considered our difficulties and agreed to lend 2 million yuan from the Beining Railway to solve the urgent need. I am deeply grateful and hereby send a telegram to thank you. Your brother Zhang Xueliang.</p>
<p>(6) Zhang to Gu Mengyu Telegram Nanjing Ministry of Railways Minister Gu Mengyu Brother Jian, I recently received a telegram from Minister Song Ziwen, knowing that the matter of borrowing 2 million yuan from the Beining Railway has been generously agreed by you. I am deeply grateful and hope that you will immediately telegraph the bureau to allocate it quickly to meet the urgent needs. Your brother Zhang Xueliang. (7) Zhang San to Song Ziwen Telegram Nanjing Minister Song Ziwen Brother Jian, I am extremely grateful for your great efforts to make the borrowing of the Beining Railway funds possible. I hereby send a telegram to thank you. Your brother Zhang Xueliang. (8) Wang Zhaoming replied to the Commander-in-Chief's Office Director Zhang Jian, I have received your telegram. Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance relayed your intention to allocate 2 million yuan from the Beining Railway. I immediately handed it over to Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways for handling. This is a matter for the competent department, and I cannot directly allocate the loan. I hope you will understand. Zhaoming. (9) Gu Mengyu replied to Director Zhang Hanqing Brother Jian, I have received your telegram, borrowing 2 million yuan from the Beining Railway. President Wang instructed our ministry to handle it. After investigation, Beining does not have a large amount of money. Even if there is a small amount of savings, it is needed for repairing bridges and other maintenance of railway administration, and the use has been designated. Moreover, the Beining Railway has a contractual relationship with the British company, and the consent of the British company is required for the allocation of funds. In order to maintain national credit, it seems inappropriate to forcibly borrow it. However, your place urgently needs funds to resist foreign aggression. I will try my best to raise funds to help. The Ministry of Railways, in the midst of economic hardship, will order Beining to advance the agreed amount of assistance for three months to meet the urgent needs. The money will be deducted in the next three months. In this way, the railway has done its best. I hope you will understand. Your brother Gu Mengyu.</p>
<p>(10) Song's third reply telegram to Beiping Director Zhang Hanqing Brother Jian, President Wang told me in person that Minister Gu has agreed to your brother's borrowing of 2 million yuan from the Beining Railway. However, according to Gu's knowledge, Director Gao has designated the funds for the purchase of materials. If you can negotiate with Director Gao to deal with the funds for the purchase of materials, there should be no problem with the Ministry of Railways. Please inquire with Director Gao to find out the situation and reply so that I can urge you on your behalf. Your younger brother Song Ziwen.</p>
<p>(11) Zhang Jingli to Gu Mengyu Telegram Nanjing Ministry of Railways Minister Jian, Li set off late at night, feeling that Chen, the Chief Auditor, was in the same car to Ping, and immediately met Director Gao to convey your intention. 1. Regarding the speech, after Li explained in detail, Director Gao was able to deeply understand your intention and there was no misunderstanding. 2. Regarding the construction of Shida, Director Gao only stated his opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of Beining. As for the overall planning, it should be presided over by you, and there is no objection. Beining takes into account both Pingui, and Director Gao believes that it is a win-win situation if they are combined, and a loss-loss situation if they are separated. He had previously suggested to Director Zhang, but due to various reasons, Song could not implement it. Since you have this intention, please telegraph Director Zhang first and then review it. 3. The British Boxer Indemnity funds were used to purchase materials for Beining, and the current funds of Beining were allocated for Guangdong-Han construction funds, and the mutual accommodation was agreed upon. Director Gao also quite agrees and is willing to handle it according to the Ministry's intention. The detailed method will be determined after Li returns to the Ministry with the head of the accounting department. Regarding the borrowing of railway funds, according to Director Gao, he received Director Zhang's copy of Minister Song's secret telegram, saying, "I have received your telegram, borrowing 2 million yuan from the Beining Railway, and I have discussed it with President Wang, and Minister Gu Mengyu has ordered the bureau to allocate the amount to your brother. I would like to report this." Director Gao has not yet issued this order, so Director Gao is inconvenient to allocate it. Li should inform Director Gao of your intention and clarify it to Director Zhang. (1) Beining Railway does not have a large amount of savings. (2) The British and Chinese companies may find it difficult to agree. (3) The general plan for assistance has just been decided by the hospital, and it seems inappropriate to change it suddenly. Director Gao expressed his deep agreement and intends to discuss with Director Zhang to advance several months of fixed assistance each month, which seems to be more appropriate. If you approve, please reply by telegram. Zhang Jingli. (12) Gao Jiyi presented a telegram to the Ministry of Railways Nanjing Ministry of Railways Minister Gu Jian, Zhang, the head of accounting, recently read the draft telegram presented to you. There are some discrepancies between the borrowing of 2 million yuan and the conversation I had that day. I only replied that Minister Song had already sent a telegram, and the original text could be sent for review in the evening. In addition, I did not express any opinions. I would like to clarify this. However, I would like to offer my humble opinion to you on this matter. At this time of serious national crisis, we must urgently seek to resist foreign aggression. However, to resist foreign aggression, we must first have sufficient weapons. The most urgent task is to raise funds. Minister Song's consultation with President Wang and the telegram to Director Zhang was also due to the difficult national situation and the exhaustion of the treasury, and this move was taken as a last resort. I believe that it is an unavoidable solution. I believe that it is appropriate to agree, so that the future of the country will definitely be greatly benefited. As for the current situation of Beining, it is not easy to raise huge sums of money suddenly. I have seen the tragedy of foreign tribes encroaching on us, and I will try my best to raise funds in a situation where there is no way to do so, in order to alleviate the central government's worries about exhausting all resources. I respectfully present my sincerity. Is there anything appropriate? I respectfully await your decision. Gao Jiyi respectfully presented. (13) Song Ziwen's telegram from Shanghai to Beiping Director Zhang Hanqing Brother Jian, regarding the allocation and borrowing of 2 million yuan from the Beining Railway, I recently received a telegram from Jingwei, according to the Ministry of Railways' reply, although the Beining Railway Bureau has this amount of money, it is all designated for use and related to national credit, so it is difficult to allocate and borrow the full amount, ☐☐☐☐, ☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐, has ordered the railway bureau to find a way to allocate and borrow three months of assistance to help, I hereby send a telegram to report. Your younger brother Song Ziwen. (14) To Song Ziwen Telegram from Shanghai, Urgent, Shanghai Qiqi Road Minister Song Ziwen Brother Jian, I have received your telegram. I am grateful for your concern regarding the allocation and borrowing of funds from the Beining Railway. I have now inquired with the railway and confirmed that there is a verifiable amount that can be allocated. I have telegraphed to Ji, respectfully asking you to take the trouble to help. Special reply, Your brother Zhang Xueliang. (15) An Zhong to Zhang Xiangkui Telegram from Beiping Pingui Railway Bureau to Zhang Xiangkui Brother Jian, Chief Auditor of the Beiping Pingui Railway Bureau, Please forward it to Accountant Zhang Jian, I recently received a face-to-face order from the Minister, and Director Gao's telegram has been received. He believes that Director Zhang urgently needs funds and earnestly asks you to agree. However, the Ministry bears the heavy responsibility of the entire railway. Even in the midst of economic hardship, it must achieve some results in the railway to avoid criticism from all parties. Director Gao stated that resisting foreign aggression is urgent and Director Zhang urgently needs funds, which is true. In addition to the three months of assistance that were previously agreed to be borrowed, it may not be impossible to provide further accommodation to Director Zhang's request. However, at the same time, we must also take into account the Ministry's responsibilities and the ardent expectations of all parties for construction. It is now planned to withdraw 2 million yuan from Beining to promote the urgently needed Guangdong-Han Railway. If Beining can take care of both sides, the Ministry will do its best to help Beining and solve its difficulties in the future. The relationship between the Ministry and the Railway is close, and it is best to help each other and maintain each other. Please discuss each point with Director Gao earnestly to gain understanding and hope for a reply by telegram so that it can be submitted to the Ministry for review. Zhi Anzhong. (16) Zhang to Luo Wengan Telegram Urgent, Nanjing Minister Luo Junren Brother Jian, Due to active preparations for resisting foreign aggression, the funds here are extremely depleted. I have repeatedly telegraphed to the central government to appeal for assistance. Although I have received replies agreeing to handle it, I have been hoping for it for a long time and have not seen a single cent. Therefore, in desperation, I have tried my best to plan. After investigating, I found that the Beining Railway Bureau still has several million yuan in savings. After inquiring and confirming, I telegraphed to Jing Gong and the relevant authorities to request 2 million yuan. I was granted permission and replied to me. Unexpectedly, just as it was proceeding, the Ministry of Railways suddenly claimed that the funds were designated for the purchase of materials and might lose credit. It was changed to a plan to pre-allocate three months of assistance from the railway. Not only was the amount vastly different, but also the fact that it was borrowing from the future and did not actually increase the allocation of a single cent. Considering the financial difficulties of the central government, I had to find a way to plan locally since the previous appeal was not answered. Unexpectedly, when the proposed relief plan was already in place, there was a sudden obstruction. I could not understand it after thinking about it a hundred times and could only sigh. Since the national crisis, I have borne the responsibility of hardship in my position of waiting for punishment. I have swallowed my anger and tried my best, but the affairs of the subordinates and the needs of defense cannot be done without funds. My brother knows the situation very well and is very concerned about it. Now that the Rehe alarm is frequent and the arrows are ready to be fired, it is still like quenching thirst with plums. In this situation, the party and state personnel declare to the people that they will work together to face the country's difficulties, but it is no different from empty words. Thinking about the future, there are endless difficulties and deep hidden worries, I would rather die. If my brother can find a way to help, both public and private parties will be deeply grateful. If not, even if I sacrifice my life, it will be difficult to cook without rice. As a last resort, I can only resign and give way to the worthy. I am especially spreading my sincerity, and I hope you will understand. Your brother Zhang Xueliang. (17) Luo Wengan replied to Beiping Director Zhang Hanqing Brother Jian, Jiang telegram has arrived. I have discussed the matter of withdrawing savings from the Beining Railway Bureau with Mr. Wang in detail. The Ministry of Railways is not planning to overturn the previous agreement, but there are some twists and turns in the accounting procedures. It is still under discussion. Your brother's determination to resist is greatly admired by Mr. Wang. He will do his best to assist in all defense measures. Please rest assured. I have not met Mengyu yet due to eye problems. I sent a letter yesterday. I will be able to meet at the hospital meeting tomorrow and will report your situation in detail. Your brother Wengan. (18) Luo Wengan's telegram Urgent, Beiping Director Zhang Hanqing Brother Jian, I have received your telegram. After receiving Hao's telegram, I immediately met Wang. He also received your brother's telegram at the same time. He immediately summoned Ren Chao and Mengyu to discuss. The four of us agreed that we should immediately find a way to raise the 2 million yuan you requested and Wang should telegram Song to raise it immediately. Wang said that no matter what, this cannot be delayed. Wang also suggested that we should try to imitate the Shanghai fundraising in the spring of this year. (Omitted). Your brother Wengan. (19) Wang Zhaoming's letter Brother Hanqing Jian, I was treated very well during my days in Beiping and I am very grateful. Recently, there have been warnings in Rehe and my brother has been anxious. I am not sure what I am thinking about. I have received many letters from you and I can see your brother's determination for the country and the nation. I originally planned to entrust a trusted comrade to come to pay my respects within a few days and report everything on my behalf. Just as Comrade Xiao Encheng returned to Beijing from Lushan to visit his relatives, I met and talked with him. Knowing that he had received an argument when he was about to leave in Ping, I entrusted Brother Encheng to convey my inner feelings. I hope you will understand. I will not go into details. I respectfully wish you well. Your brother Wang Zhaoming.</p>
<p>2. Full Text of the Telegram from the Beiping Political Affairs Committee Requesting Funds for Rehe to Commander-in-Chief Jiang of Hankou, Nanjing National Government Jian, Minister Song of the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, President Wang of the Executive Yuan Xun Jian, It is found that Rehe's finances are extremely difficult. There are many accumulated deficits in political expenses, and military expenses are particularly difficult to have a fixed amount. At this time when a strong enemy is eyeing the border, the province's troops have repeatedly received instructions to make various defensive preparations. The province's government has submitted it to the committee for detailed discussion. Because it is related to national defense, it is necessary to approve the province's government's request for the central government to raise funds quickly. In addition to publicly recommending Committee Member Li Yuying to lead the responsible personnel to Beijing to report everything in detail, I hereby send a telegram to report and instruct you to quickly raise relief measures. Special telegram to report, respectfully request quick relief measures, and look forward to it with impatience. Delegates of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee Zhang Xueliang, Li Yuying, Zhang Ji, Han Fuqu, Xu Yongchang, Zhou Zuomin, Wu Dingchang, Wang Shuhan, Yu Xuezhong, Zhang Boling, Zhang Zuoxiang, Jiang Bocheng, Shang Zhen, Song Zheyuan, Fu Zuoyi, Pang Bingxun, Wan Fulin, Men Zhizhong, Tang Yulin, Xiong Xiling, Fang Benren, Liu Zhe, Lu Dangping, Sun Kuiyuan printed.</p>
<h3>Niu Lan Case</h3>
<h3>Continued Trial Situation (Continued)</h3>
<p>Niu Lan's Attitude is Cunning and Overbearing, Answering Irrelevantly (Question) Are these registered radio numbers yours? (Niu) He did not answer and still asked the court to present the keys and application for the mailbox. The judge said that Niu's answer was inappropriate and said that the mailbox was no longer asked now, but the telegram registration number was being asked. (Niu) Please present the registration application. (Question) If you don't answer the question, it is useless to present the application. According to this situation, the case may not be asked for three years. (Question) Are you the secretary of the Pacific Workers' Union? If you are not the secretary, why would he guarantee you? (Question) Percy Mann, chairman of the British Independent Labor Party, telegraphed to guarantee you. What is your relationship with him? (Question) Xiang Zhongfa of the Communist Party is related to this case. According to Xiang's confession in the case file, the person in charge of the International Communist Party's Oriental Department in Shanghai, Miff, was replaced by a Polish person after returning to his country. The Polish person claimed to be from Belgium and said that this person has now been arrested in the British Concession in Shanghai. He also said that the economic sources of the Chinese Communist Party are all provided by the International Communist Party, a total of 15,000 US dollars, equivalent to about 56,000 Chinese currency. The Chinese Southern, Manchurian, and Jiangnan Bureaus and the Yangtze River Bureau all received assistance. (Niu) This point was not presented when I was at the Longhua Nanjing Supreme Court. (Question) When you were arrested, you said you were from Belgium. The person Xiang Zhongfa said is you. (Niu) Please provide evidence that the Communist Party is related to me and prove whether I am a Polish national. (Question) Gu Shunzhang confessed in the Xiang case that the Third International sent nine representatives to live in Shanghai, which is the International Far East Bureau. There are Polish, German, and Russian people among them. The director of the bureau is Niu Lan, and we all call him (Old Man). There is also a woman who is said to be Niu Lan's wife, but in fact she is not Niu Lan's wife, but was sent by the Third International to monitor Niu Lan. Niu has never seen this witness before. Please call this witness to court. At this point, the judge ordered Niu Lan to sit down and changed to call Wang Deli Zeng. (Question) Niu Lan is not your husband. If you say Niu Lan is your husband, you should say the location of the marriage and the marriage certificate. (Wang) No answer. (Question) According to the case file of Gu Shunzhang that was just transferred, you were sent by the Third International to monitor Niu Lan. (Wang) Is there any evidence? (Question) There is an official document from the Gu case that Gu confessed in Hankou. (Wang) Please present the evidence. The judge then ordered the translator to present the case file to the defendant and translate the entire case into English. After the translation was completed, Niu Lan got up and said that this statement did not have the court's seal and did not state the date. The court should pay attention to it. The judge replied that the date of this document was April 15. Niu said that when the case was tried in Shanghai, the representative sent by the Kuomintang to Shanghai said that Gu was arrested on May 28 and the date of April 15 may be wrong. At this point, the judge asked Wang Deli Zeng again, (Question) Were you sent by the Third International to supervise Niu Lan? (Wang) Please pay attention to the court. Gu's confession stated that Niu Lan had a wife on one hand, and on the other hand, it said that she was not Niu's wife, and it also said that this woman lived in the wall of Niu Lan's residence after she came to China to monitor Niu Lan. (Question) If you are Niu Lan's wife, you should provide the location of the marriage and evidence. (Wang) No answer. The judge then changed to ask Niu Lan, (Question) Have you always been a communist? (Niu) There must be evidence. (Question) This court is asking about the crime of endangering the Republic of China. Whether you have always been a communist has nothing to do with this court. Today I am asking you, have you always been a communist? (Niu) If the court cannot provide evidence, the defendant should be declared innocent. The judge asked again whether Niu had always been a communist. Niu also asked the judge in return whether the court could prove that he was a communist. The judge asked again whether Niu was a communist. Niu did not answer. The judge said, "If you are not a communist, why is there a photo of you and Wang Deli Zeng in the photo of the Fifth Congress of the South African Communist Party in 1927?" After finishing speaking, he presented the photo to the two defendants. After Niu saw it, he grinned and asked the court to ask experts to identify whether the person in the photo was Niu Lan, and suggested that the court enlarge the photo for the audience to watch. The judge said that although this photo cannot be considered as evidence of a crime, it is sufficient to prove that you are a communist. At this point, Wang Deli Zeng asked the judge when the photo was taken and where it was found. The judge said that it was taken in 1927 and found in South Africa and sent by the Chinese Consulate. Niu Lan said that South Africa is a British colony and they can fabricate evidence to frame me, and there is no evidence that it is a consulate. The judge said that there is an official document from the consulate and presented it to the defendant. Wang Deli Zeng said that the letter did not state the reason for sending it and whether the defendant was identified. Niu said that he was not surprised by the photos sent by the Chinese Consulate under the command of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because the Minister of Foreign Affairs is the consul's superior. As for the documentary evidence published in the Chinese and foreign newspapers on September 6 last year, it was also published by the Chinese authorities. They are all in other people's handwriting and insist that they are my handwriting. This point should be asked to identify the handwriting and photos, etc. The questioning stopped at 12 o'clock. The judge announced that the case will not be tried today and will continue to be heard at 8 o'clock on the morning of the 12th. He then ordered Niu and his wife to be returned to prison and adjourned the court. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Sericulture Design Conference</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry will convene the Sericulture Design Committee meeting at Shenglu, No. 2 Er Ma Road, Zhenjiang today (13th). All the members believe that the sericulture industry in our country is declining and we should try to remedy it. Although some of them are avoiding the summer heat in Qingdao and other places, they all arrived on schedule. It is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony on the morning of the 13th, and hold the first general meeting. In the afternoon, there will be a review meeting. On the morning of the 14th, there will be the second general meeting, and in the afternoon, there will be the third general meeting, which will be closed. According to Director He Yushu, the silk industry in our country has always used the United States as its market. Recently, due to the economic decline in the United States, on the one hand, and the import of Japanese goods at low prices, the silk factories in our country have been severely oppressed. Among the forty or fifty silk factories in Wuxi, only about ten are operating. Therefore, the price of cocoons has also fallen extremely low, and farmers feel great difficulties. Moreover, due to the failure of sericulture, there is a trend that mulberry fields will be used to plant other crops. If we want to alleviate its shortcomings, we should take advantage of the advantages of our country's land and labor, and strive for the economic rationalization of costs, so that the cost of sericulture is light and the silk factory industry can also compete with Japanese merchants. This conference has been established for two years and has made great contributions to the administration of sericulture. Now all the members can value the national economy and the people's livelihood, and come here despite the summer heat, which is deeply gratifying. Furthermore, many proposals from all parties have been received. It is expected that gathering together and gathering wisdom will definitely open up the opportunity for the revival of our country's silk industry.</p>
<h3>Progress of Postal Transportation in Gansu</h3>
<p>The Use of Cars Between Pingliang and Gaolan for Transportation Lanzhou Correspondence, Since the postal transportation between Chang'an (Xi'an) and Pingliang was changed to car transportation last year, the public has praised it as convenient and beneficial. However, the section from Pingliang to Gaolan still uses the old method of manual labor and mule and horse transportation, which is inevitably slow. Now, the Gansu Postal Administration, in order to continue to develop transportation and facilitate merchants and residents, has specially prepared a number of postal vehicles to transport mail and parcels back and forth between Pingliang and Gaolan. It has been implemented on August 1 this year. In the past, it took more than 20 days to transport parcels between Chang'an and Gaolan by train, and even the fastest light mail (letters, postcards, etc.) took 10 days. Now, it only takes five days to reach it by car. All mail from various parts of Gansu and southeastern provinces is transported to Tongguan by the Longhai Railway, and then from Tongguan to Gaolan, all of which are now transported in sections by car to connect. All types of postage remain the same as before, and the speed of transportation has doubled.</p>

<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Provincial Order to Arrest Wang Nianzeng Wang Nianzeng, the former director of the Taicang County Public Security Bureau, abandoned his post and fled without any news after the Japanese army invaded on March 1. The entire county's security was in desperate straits. Now the provincial government has issued an order to all counties to strictly arrest him.</p>
<p>Gunshots in the Middle of the Night, Suspected Drowning On the night of the ninth of this month at eleven o'clock, dozens of gunshots suddenly rang out continuously in the southeast corner of Zhitang Town, a county. Gu Gengcai, the captain of the water police team stationed in the town, heard the alarm and immediately led a platoon of armed police officers to patrol along the sound. When he reached the Provincial Temple, he saw a sailing ship approaching along the pond. Captain Yin saw that his behavior was suspicious and ordered the ship to stop. As the ship approached the shore, a passenger suddenly jumped into the water to escape. The captain immediately ordered the police officers to rescue him. The passenger was already unconscious. According to the passenger, he was sixty years old. Because he was carrying eighty yuan in paper money, he suddenly heard dense gunshots near Chatang and felt uneasy. Now he heard the order to stop the ship and suspected that there was another change, so he jumped into the water. Captain Yin interrogated the former situation and searched the sailing ship before releasing it.</p>

<p>Request for Higher Court Re-examination of a Wife-Beating Death Case: Gu, the daughter-in-law of Wu Haibo, a resident of Jiangbei outside Xiaoximen, was beaten to death by family members who falsely claimed she had hanged herself. The Public Security Bureau arrested Wu, his wife Sun, his son Jin Sheng, and his daughters Zhai and Jia for interrogation. They remained uncooperative. After opening the coffin for examination on the sixth day, the examiner, Jin Mengyu, lacked experience and could not clearly identify the injuries on the deceased, causing widespread dissatisfaction. These details were reported in previous news. At 10:00 AM on the eleventh, Chen Ying, an adjudicator from the County Government, summoned the deceased's mother, Chen, and her uncle Chen Naifen, along with Wu Haibo and four others, for a court hearing. Approximately five to six hundred people gathered to listen to the hearing. Wu Haibo and others testified that Gu had died by hanging herself. Adjudicator Chen, based on the testimony, stated to Chen and Chen Naifen, "It is regrettable that the examiner could not determine the cause of your daughter's death the other day. This case has been submitted to the Higher Court for a re-examination to uncover the truth. We will summon you again later." Wu and the other four were then taken into custody.</p>

On the morning of the tenth, Jin Feng sent a colleague to Suzhou with the large sum of money to deliver it to the various Zhuang. Upon inquiry, it was discovered that Jin Feng had not sent anyone to Suzhou to withdraw the funds and that Wang Yangchen and others were embezzling. They immediately began searching for the suspects and the loot. Li and Wang were apprehended at the South Railway Station in Shanghai the night before. Upon inspection of the cash, only 300 yuan were missing. They were escorted to Suzhou yesterday for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Completion of the Examination of the Nanqian Murder Case: Regarding the case of Wang, the wife of Gu Afu, a villager in Nanqian Village, Eleventh District (Nanyan City), who was found dead in the river near the Sushe Bridge last month, the body was transported to the Shengdi Temple in Huishan on the tenth for an autopsy. Because the body had decomposed, it was necessary to scrape the bones for examination. As a result, the procedure could not be completed that day. At 9:00 AM yesterday (the eleventh), Prosecutor Shen, along with the court clerk, the coroner, the suspect, and the family of the deceased, went to the Shengdi Temple to scrape the bones for examination. The examination revealed sand and mud in the skull and a wooden wound approximately two inches long on the left arm bone, indicating that the deceased had been injured before falling into the river and drowning. The examination was completed at 3:00 PM. Prosecutor Shen ordered the bones, the suspect, the family of the deceased, and the witnesses to be brought to the court. After interrogation, he ordered the suspect, Zhu Gengquan, to be taken into custody. The others were instructed to return and come to the court in ten days to claim the remains.</p>
<p>The Silk Cocoon Market Shows Signs of Revival: Wuxi has long been known for its silk cocoons. For the past two years, due to sluggish sales in Europe and America, the market has plummeted, and the silk cocoon industry has suffered greatly. The silk cocoon market was almost dead, with hardly anyone paying attention. However, in the past month, it has gradually shown signs of revival. The United States and France have begun to take action, and the price of silk has risen by more than sixty taels. Shanghai and Wuxi have been actively purchasing raw materials, and the dried cocoon market has shown signs of activity. On one day recently, more than 1,000 dan of dried cocoons were traded. Improved varieties and high-quality cocoons were in high demand, and prices rose several times a day, increasing by fifty to sixty yuan per dan compared to the beginning of the month. The current highest price is about 170 yuan, and further increases are expected.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Sends Personnel to Investigate Industrial and Commercial Conditions: In order to understand the industrial and commercial conditions of the country and to conduct accurate statistics for the purpose of developing industry, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce plans to compile a National Industrial Chronicle, which will be organized by the International Trade Bureau. The Bureau has sent personnel to various provinces to conduct thorough investigations and collect accurate data. It has been decided to start with Jiangsu, dividing it into two regions: Jiangnan and Jiangbei. Yesterday, Lu Guoxiang, Ma Jibo, Jiang Xuekai, and Zhao Jian were sent as investigators. They came to Wuxi yesterday and immediately contacted the county government and the chamber of commerce separately. The investigation focuses on agricultural products, industrial raw materials, and the production and sales of machine-made and handicraft industries.</p>
<p>The Dispute Over Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Remains Unresolved: The dispute over the tobacco and alcohol license tax, which has been contested between the Ministry of Finance and the province, remains unresolved. Since the Executive Yuan ordered the province to be directly administered by the Ministry of Finance, the Jiangsu Department of Finance sent personnel to the Ministry to negotiate and transfer the five districts to the Beijing Bureau. However, when the five districts in Suzhou were established, a deposit of 80,000 yuan was paid to the Jiangsu Department of Finance. The Department required the Beijing Bureau to reimburse this amount, but the Beijing Bureau refused, and the issue remains unresolved. Yesterday, the county government received another telegram from the Department of Finance, ordering the collection offices to report the actual amount of tax collected from July 1st to the present date as soon as possible for verification.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Provincial Security Team Suppresses Bandits in Jiangbei: Recently, bandits have become rampant in the Jiangbei area. The Provincial Government specially telegraphed the First Regiment of the Provincial Security Team to send a team to suppress them. Regiment Commander Zhu Mian immediately sent the First Battalion and the Fourth Battalion, stationed in this county, to suppress the bandits. After receiving the order, Battalion Commander Wang of the Fourth Battalion, in addition to sending all the troops stationed in Changshu to Jiangbei, also recalled the Eleventh Company from Pingwang to join the operation. However, after these troops left, Regiment Commander Zhu considered the defense of the area along the Yangtze River, including Fushan and Liuhe, to be very important. He ordered the Eighth Company of the Third Battalion to take over the defense of the Liuhe area. The company, led by Company Commander Li Xu, arrived in Liuhe on the tenth. The company headquarters is stationed in the Ning Shao Guild Hall in the north gate of the city. Furthermore, the 87th Division of the Army, which participated in previous battles, is currently stationed along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Recently, Division Commander Wang Jingjiu, concerned about the increasing banditry in Jiangbei, sent an independent brigade to Jiangbei on the ninth. The brigade passed through the county and crossed the river at Liuhe in the morning to reach Tongzhou.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>

<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Anti-Bandit Conference in Tonghaiqi: Due to the unrest caused by bandits in the Tonghaiqi area, the Military Commission transferred the First Regiment of the Provincial Security Team to defend and suppress the bandits. In order to understand the bandit situation and the strength of the police and militia in the three counties, Regiment Commander Zhu Mian convened a joint anti-bandit conference at the Nantong Club on the eleventh, inviting Zhang Dong, the County Magistrate of Nantong, Zhang Weixie, the County Magistrate of Haimen, and Fei Gongxia, the County Magistrate of Qidong. Security was tight.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Robbery and Murder in the Dark of Night: The home of Xu Guoyou, a farmer in Xujiaxia, the Third District of the county, was raided by eight bandits on the night of the eighth. Each bandit carried a large knife and broke into the house. They tied up his family and demanded money. At that time, Xu's third son, Hongmei, was startled and tried to escape. The bandits saw him and shot him down. At that moment, neighbors heard the gunshots and knew there was a bandit alarm. They beat gongs and shouted for help. The bandits panicked and fired their guns as they fled, taking only some small items. However, the third son, Hongmei, died the next morning due to his injuries. The victim has reported the incident to the district office, which has forwarded it to the county government, requesting a strict investigation and arrest.</p>
<h3>Funing</h3>
<p>The Spread of the Epidemic is Worrying: The epidemic has been prevalent in this city this summer, and the number of deaths is unprecedented. As of the third of this month, according to accurate statistics from the relief院, more than 130 people have died. Recently, it has become even more severe. In the town north of the city alone, more than ten people have died and dozens are sick. At the beginning of the epidemic, the symptoms include dizziness, followed by vomiting and diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and sunken fingers. Those with these symptoms generally die without treatment.</p>
<p>The Signs of Drought and Famine are Evident: Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been very little rainfall, and most of the drought-resistant crops have withered and died. The harvest of aquatic crops, such as early rice, is only half of what it should be. Late rice is affected by diseases such as white sheath blight and螟虫, making it difficult to expect a good harvest. As a result, the price of rice has skyrocketed, rising from 2.7 yuan to 3.5 yuan per dan. The price of barley has risen from 70-80 cents to 1.2 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Higher Court Sentences in Xiaoshan Husband-Killing Case: Cai Meisheng, a resident of Shicun Cao in Xiaoshan County, was killed by his wife, Cai Cao, in collusion with her lover, Xu Arong, and with the help of accomplices Cao Chuanlai and Cao Along.

After the case was discovered, the county court sentenced Cai Cao and Xu Arong to death for premeditated murder, and Cao Chuanlai to fifteen years in prison for assisting in the murder. Cai Cao and Xu Arong appealed to the provincial court. The criminal court of the Higher Court held several trials. Yesterday (the twelfth) morning, the court announced that the appeal had no grounds and should be rejected. The original judgment was upheld, and the death penalty was to be carried out.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Arson and Kidnapping Case in the Western Countryside: A case of bandits setting fire to houses due to failed extortion occurred in Xujialou, a village in the western countryside of Shaoxing, yesterday afternoon. Yu Erbao, a resident of the area, had received threatening letters from bandits demanding a large sum of money, but he ignored them. This angered the bandits, who gathered a group of people armed with guns and left from Yejia Mountain to Yu's house. They broke into Yu's house and set it on fire to vent their anger. The fire lasted for several hours, destroying dozens of houses. Yu escaped beforehand and avoided the disaster. That night, the bandits went to Qiuhu and kidnapped Dai Jingxuan's grandson and shot Dai Jingxuan's eldest son before leaving. The police team intercepted them on the way, rescued the hostage, and killed one bandit on the spot. Another bandit was captured and sent to the court for trial yesterday.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Kidnapping of a Child in Shicun Cao: Cao Jiqing, a resident of Shicun Cao outside the south gate of Xiaoshan, is a wealthy fish farmer. Most of the money shops in the city have shares held by Cao, making him a target for bandits. On the night of the ninth of this month, more than ten bandits speaking the local dialect broke into his house, pulled out guns, and threatened them to remain silent. They kidnapped Cao's son and left. Cao and his wife tried to stop them, but the bandits fired their guns to scare them away. They were forced to let them go and fled towards Nanmengang. The next morning, Cao reported the incident to the county government and requested their assistance in the arrest.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Tragic Incident Before the Departure of the Police Brigade to Bengbu: After the two regiments of the First Police Brigade of Anhui, led by Shi Zhongcheng, were ordered to be transferred to the command of Hu Zongnan, commander of the First Division, they moved from Dianbu in Dongxiang to the city. The heavy mortar company stationed in Qinghua Temple in the northern enclosure had 36 mortar shells stored in the Tongxing oil mill nearby.

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the National Sports Conference</h3>
<h3>(2) Lu Peixuan</h3>
<p>(4) The Ministry of Education should add a Sports Division or Section, and the Provincial Education Departments (廳) or Bureaus (局) should add Sports Instructors. The development of any undertaking must be specialized and refined. As the ancients said, "If a worker wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." This principle is very clear and need not be elaborated. Therefore, educational administrative organs at all levels should have specialized personnel, which is the meaning of seeking to do things well by first sharpening the tools. (5) Establishing the China Sports Research Association to integrate Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern sports into one large furnace and gradually create a new sports system. Today's sports organizations in China often cannot integrate the old and the new, and each goes its own way. If the National Martial Arts Hall can promote national essence, and physical education gradually abandons the Jianghu school and enters the right path, the Sports Association has also been able to manage domestic and foreign competitions, and introduce new rules to review formal sports results, its achievements are great. However, what is lacking is that it should be based on the spirit of integrating ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign sports, and establish a large group of sports administration and management, and also have research qualities, regardless of faction or mystery, conduct open research, and apply science to organize it. Therefore, the establishment of the China Sports Research Association is indeed a matter of urgency. Its hope is to create a new Chinese sports method in the future. Various methods in sports and comrades in the sports world must have their own strengths, and often have their own shortcomings. Foreign sports may not be completely suitable for China, and my country's ancient sports may not be completely suitable for modern times. (6) (Promulgate that the National Games will be held once every few years and permanently established as a law), it is best to hold it three months before each Far Eastern Games, which can determine the foreign players and allow each province, city, and district to view the sports results. It must not be shifted due to economic reasons and the interests of the authorities. Once it is stipulated that it will be held once every few years, the bad habits of wasting studies, harming the body, and all violations of physical education can be avoided, and everyone can have an upward mentality, and the results will gradually improve. After the meeting, a conference can be convened. (7) (Each county should uniformly set up public sports fields, and each park and mass education hall, as well as districts, towns, and villages must also have simple sports grounds). To popularize physical education, it is necessary to set up more public sports fields. In large cities, there should be five districts in the east, south, west, north, and center, in proportion to the population, and approximately one public sports field should be set up for every 10,000 people. (8) (Reward private public sports fields and order the military, police, regiment (security team), and schools to open sports fields as appropriate). Public funding is limited to rewarding private public sports fields or leasing land to set them up and recovering them after a full year. The equipment should include all kinds of sports, games, competitions, physical fitness equipment, bathing, swimming, and various instruments for testing physical fitness and strength. It is okay to have a slightly business-like quality to encourage investment to achieve that everyone is an athlete, and anywhere is a sports field. On the one hand, open the sports fields of military, police, regiment, and schools to make up for the insufficiency.</p>

<p>Rotary Cup Finals Day 1</p>
<h3>China Wins Both Groups</h3>
<p>English Players are No Match for China. Today's afternoon competition was the Sino-British finals in the Rotary Cup International Tennis Doubles, which began yesterday at the China Tennis Court. There were 500-600 spectators. China won both groups of singles matches. The difference in strength was quite large, so there was little interest. Both matches ended within half an hour, which can be said to be as easy as pie.</p>
<h3>(1) Lin Baohua Defeats Turner</h3>
<p>|6-0, 6-0, 6-1| In the first group, Lin Baohua of China played against Turner of England. The English player was old and steady, but how could he withstand Lin Baohua's wonderful shots? He could not lift the frame, let alone counterattack. It was as if he was being played by Lin Baohua under the racket, running east and west, working hard but without success. The victory was decided in just 19 games.</p>
<h3>(2) Zheng Zhaojia Wins Stokes</h3>
<p>|6-2, 6-2, 6-0| The situation in this group was similar to the previous group, only more intense. Stokes was originally a brave general, good at running, but when he met the young Zheng Zhaojia, he could only run around in the aftermath of Zheng's racket. The result of the three sets was only 22 games. Watching Zheng's skills, the progress was very rapid. Yesterday's diagonal shot was just right. It was wonderful, and the ball was sharp and decisive. Various shooting methods can be applied and used to win. There is no more of the past timidity, which can be called a successful masterpiece.</p>
<h3>(3) Fierce Battle in Today's Doubles</h3>
<p>|Starting at 4:30 PM| Today is the doubles match. China will send Lin Baohua and Jiang Daozhang. The English players are the famous Huite and Turner. The competition will start at 4:30 PM. The strength of the English players is quite strong, and there will be a fierce battle today. The outcome is unpredictable.</p>

The sequence of the three matches is listed on the left, with the team names and groups, times, venues, and referees.

<h3>Tapping Bells in Ancient Temples Record: Not Removing the Grass in the Courtyard Study Hall Husband</h3>
<p>80 (73) Mr. Tang said... (The car knocked down the sedan chair, but not the handcart, I admit that it is a fact. But can this example be applied to the textile industry? It is a big question. Taking spinning as an example, spinning by hand, each person can spin at most eight taels of yarn per day, and at least four taels of yarn. On average, it is only six taels of yarn. Machine spinning allows each person to spin 20 pounds in eight hours per day, which is 40 times more efficient. Sometimes, selling the spun coarse yarn cannot even sell at the price of cotton. Therefore, it is better to exchange cotton for machine-spun yarn than to use yarn spun by oneself. The inability of hand spinning to resist machine spinning seems to be a very obvious fact. Hand spinning is like a sedan chair, not a handcart. Machine spinning is like a car, and driving away hand spinning is like driving away a sedan chair, which is bound to drive it away completely, leaving none. How can it still be promoted?) Mr. Zhu said (Hand spinning and machine spinning fighting alone is like Belgium opening fire on Germany alone, and it is inevitable to be defeated. But Belgium still exists today because it is united with many countries. We are not promoting hand spinning alone to fight against machine spinning. If we were to do that, we would naturally fail without a doubt. What we advocate is the united front of the entire cotton industry production process. From cotton, spinning, weaving to making clothes, everything is grasped by the people in the cotton-producing area, without letting any external force break through the line. If it is done piecemeal, not only will hand spinning fail, but hand weaving will also inevitably fail. You use bought yarn to weave cloth in the countryside, getting up early and working late to weave a zhang or so, earning a few copper coins, how can you live? But the united front of the entire production process in the cotton-producing area has the possibility of victory. Growing cotton and not selling it saves cotton transportation costs and eliminates cotton merchants' exploitation. Spinning yarn and not selling it saves yarn transportation costs and eliminates cloth factory exploitation. Weaving cloth and wearing it saves cloth transportation costs and eliminates cloth merchant exploitation. The consumption volume outside the cotton-producing area is calculated comprehensively, and the surplus of cloth production is determined to meet the needs and avoid excess. Wouldn't this be invincible? You said that hand spinning is not as good as machine spinning but more expensive, which is half right. It is impossible to live by relying solely on hand spinning. But our farmers have five months of free time every year. There are 360 million people living in the countryside across the country. Excluding the old and young, at least 200 million people can do full productive work. One horsepower is equivalent to about eight human power. We have 25 million horsepower that we don't use for five months every year. If machines are not used, they will rust, and if people have nothing to do, they will gamble, smoke opium, and do anything. If machines are not turned on, they don't need to burn coal. If people have nothing to do, they still have to eat. There are 200 million human power in Chinese villages that burn coal every day for five months without working. What a waste! How much coal does the latest machine burn per horsepower?) Mr. Tang said (About two pounds) Mr. Zhu said (Our 200 million idle manpower does not need to add even one pound of coal. If we use it to spin and weave cloth, it will never be more expensive than machine-made products. What do you think?)</p>

<h3>Saving Wang Seems Hopeless</h3>
<p>Three Important People Made Futile Trips After Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, resigned the other night, the central authorities repeatedly sent Ju Zheng, He Yingqin, Song Ziwen, Zhu Peide, and others to persuade him to stay. However, Wang's intention to resign was firm, and in order to avoid the noise, his whereabouts were even more secret. However, the important people still negotiated ways to persuade him to stay, and still hoped that Wang would return to Nanjing as soon as possible to resume his post and preside over the central government's major policies. At around 9:00 AM yesterday, Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, and Zhu Peide visited Wang's residence on West Pubu Stone Road in succession. However, because Wang had not yet returned to the residence, Wang's wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, received them on his behalf. The important people asked Mrs. Wang to convey the intentions of all parties on their behalf, and urged her to dispel the idea of resignation in order to satisfy public expectations. However, Mrs. Wang still stated that Wang's attitude was firm and there was no room for persuasion. Song, He, and Zhu left at 9:45 AM and went to Song's residence on Qi Qi Road to discuss. He and Zhu did not return to their residences until around 11:00 AM. According to He and Zhu, everything to persuade Mr. Wang to stay is now being conveyed by Mrs. Wang. The central government, in any case, still hopes that Mr. Wang will take on the arduous task. However, since Mr. Wang has not been met in recent days, it has not been possible to make a face-to-face appeal. He Yingqin also said that the central government ordered him to return to Nanjing as soon as possible, but he still had to wait for the event of persuading Mr. Wang to stay to come to an end before returning to Nanjing, but it would probably be within two or three days. In addition, Tang Youren, accompanied by Huang Renlin, flew from Hankou to Shanghai at 2:30 PM the day before yesterday to report to Wang. Then, he was ordered by Wang to take the 11:00 PM express train back to Nanjing in the pouring rain, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming and others. Mr. Tang's trip was to carry out Wang's orders and instruct him to end all administrative affairs in order to leave them to the new appointee.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<h3>Yesterday's Reception for Albert</h3>
<p>Mr. Albert hopes that our Ministry of Industry and Ministry of Foreign Affairs' plans will be realized. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce hosted Mr. Albert, representative of the Chicago World's Fair, at its third floor location at Tianhou Palace Bridge at 5 PM yesterday. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Mr. Albert, representative of the Chicago World's Fair; Mr. Ning Han, U.S. Consul General; Vice Consul Mr. Hess Eden; Mr. Bohlen; Mr. An Luer, U.S. Commercial Attaché; Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Wang Xiao; and members Song Sun, Wang Yansong, Lao Jingxiu, Guo Weibai, Ma Jiliang, He Bingxian, Chen Zheqing, Cai Wuji, Ma Shao, Zheng Zenan, Ye Jiaxing, Zheng Chengqing, Wu Zhihao, and over forty others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Wang Xiao delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Since our country signed a treaty and started commerce with your country, we have officially participated in your country's World's Fairs. To the best of my memory, the first one was the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. That was in the second year of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty. Counting from then, it has been fifty or sixty years. At that time, both China and Japan had exhibits. According to contemporary public reports, Japan's participation in foreign exhibitions seemed to have started with that event. Because handling exhibits was a new endeavor for our country, we often relied on the Maritime Customs Service to handle things. Consequently, some of the items sent to the fair did not meet the requirements of the exposition. Later, your country held grand expositions in St. Louis and Panama. Our government deeply felt the importance of these events for revitalizing industry and commerce. Therefore, on both occasions, the government specially allocated large sums of money and dispatched official supervisors to oversee the process, emphasizing its importance. The private sector also enthusiastically submitted exhibits. At the Panama Exposition, many of our country's specialties, such as silk, tea, and porcelain, received major awards from your country. All of this is an important demonstration of the increasingly close commercial relationship between our two countries. Your country is now holding the Century of Progress International Exposition in Chicago. You have specially sent Dr. Albert to China and Japan to coordinate the preparations. Your intention is undoubtedly to make this year's exhibits even more perfect. This demonstrates the great importance your country attaches to this exposition. Our country shares this sentiment. Beforehand, the Ministry of Industry instructed the Bureau of International Trade to take charge of the preparations. The internal work was divided into seven groups, each handled by experts and responsible organizations or institutions. Now that Dr. Albert has come to coordinate in person, the outcome of open and honest consultations will surely bring more clarity to the preparations. Therefore, our chamber has prepared simple refreshments today and invited you to grace us with your presence. We sincerely request Dr. Albert's earnest guidance so that the exposition may be beneficial. This is not just a regular social gathering. All of you present are directly or indirectly involved in the exhibits. We hope that the doctor will generously share his knowledge. Especially important is that the businesses run by our countrymen residing in your country mostly serve the needs of our own expatriates. People in your country do not particularly feel the need for them. Even our specialties, such as silk and tea, although they won major awards at the Panama Exposition, their sales have been declining year by year. Therefore, our chamber believes that while it is important to make the exhibits rich and perfect, it is equally important to ensure that after the grand event concludes, these rich and perfect exhibits leave a deep impression in the minds of the people in your country, and that the desire to use Chinese goods gradually becomes widespread. This is truly an important issue today. Otherwise, what is the purpose of your country holding the Chicago Exposition and widely soliciting exhibits from our country? A few years ago, after the New York Silk Exhibition closed, our chamber also distributed the exhibits to people in your country to arouse their interest in using Chinese goods, but the actual effect was minimal. Therefore, our chamber dares to represent the entire Shanghai business community in questioning Dr. Albert: Besides striving for rich and perfect exhibits, what else should we do to leave a deep impression of our country's goods in the minds of the people in your country? We respectfully hope that Dr. Albert, based on his experience, will generously offer his advice. We would be most grateful."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Hosts Mr. Albert (Photo by Xu Tianzhang)</h3>
<p>Mr. Albert's Response: Mr. Albert expressed his thanks, saying, "Chairman, everyone, I am very grateful for your hospitality today. I just came to Shanghai from a meeting in Nanjing. Preparing to hold such a grand exposition during this time of global economic recession is no easy task. It is not only difficult in China, but it is also difficult in all countries around the world. However, I believe that countries around the world will still be able to find ways to participate in the Chicago Exposition despite this economic downturn, and the people of Chicago also hope to achieve this goal. Your government, after a meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry, has already developed a concrete plan. If this plan can be implemented, it will be a good sign of progress. Before I leave your country, I believe that your country will be able to overcome all difficulties. All of the United States hopes for China's prosperity and development. If this can be achieved during the exposition, it would be very happy. The U.S. Consul General and Commercial Attaché also hope for this. Thank you for your kind hospitality."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to the Nation</h3>
<h3>Jointly Sanction Traitorous Merchants</h3>
<p>Deprive their personality and reputation with the public will of the entire society. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram yesterday, saying, "To all national civic groups: Our chamber has repeatedly received reports that the tricks of traitorous merchants selling Japanese goods are becoming increasingly sophisticated. They often pass off Japanese fabrics as domestic goods. Initially, they counterfeit trademarks of others. Because this involves too much risk, they arbitrarily fabricate a factory name, hoping to deceive merchants in distant places. Our chamber is investigating these fabricated factory names and trademarks and sending them to patriotic groups in various locations. When these goods are discovered in your regions, please seize them in quantity to prevent others from following suit and to serve as a warning. We hope that all compatriots across the country will rise up together and fight to the end against traitorous merchants who act as accomplices for the enemy, so as to ensure the survival of our nation. Anyone who privately sells Japanese goods, regardless of whether they are relatives or old friends, should be universally despised. In other words, use the public will of society to deprive them of their lifelong personality rights and reputation rights. Perhaps the mental suffering of such people will not be less than physical wounds, and they will repent. The ancient saying 'verbal condemnation and written criticism' is more effective than axes and halberds. Peaceful struggle is the only way. Please do not disregard it as being too remote. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>First Special Court</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Trial of Yun Huifang</p>
<p>Yun Bitterly Narrates the January 28th Incident</p>
<p>Actually Caused by a Group of Traitorous Merchants</p>
<p>The Yongchang Bomb Was Not Delivered by Yun</p>
<p>Two People Have Testified to This</p>
<p>Judge Schedules On-Site Inspection of the Incident Location Today</p>
<p>This Case to Resume Next Monday</p>
<p>Patriotic youth Yun Huifang, on the evening of the fifth of this month, carrying explosives, went to Maochang Foreign Goods Store on Republic Road in the French Concession, a well-known private seller of enemy goods. She accidentally stumbled, leading to her arrest by the patrol officers of the First Precinct of the Second District of the Chinese Area. Afterwards, the French police, because the case occurred in the French Concession, transferred Yun to the Second Special District Court of First Instance of the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau for trial and conclusion. The verdict was announced the day before yesterday, sentencing her to two months of imprisonment, with a two-year reprieve due to her young age, under sixteen years old. She was allowed to be released on bail.</p>
<p>Yun Huifang's Transfer</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at this moment, Chief Inspector Glauber of the Public Concession's Public Works Department and Chinese Deputy Inspector Zhao Bingkun submitted an official letter from the First Special District Court of First Instance, stating that the threatening letters and hand grenades received by Yongchang Coal Company on Xinzha Road and the Cotton Cloth Guild on Shanxi Road in the Public Concession on July 27th and 28th were all the work of Yun Huifang. They requested extradition. The court then handed Yun over to the Chinese and Western inspectors to be taken back to the police station. After questioning, they went to Yun and Cai's residence at 207 Pike Road to search. They found a hand grenade. However, Cai had fled to another location after Yun's arrest.</p>
<p>Large Crowd of Onlookers</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the police summoned witnesses and escorted Yun to the First Special District Court of First Instance. Presiding Judge Feng Shide and Chief Prosecutor Wang Zuze took their seats in the First Criminal Court. Police prosecution lawyer Ru Baozhou and defendant's defense lawyers Li Zuyu, Shen Junru, and Zhao Chen all attended. The courtroom was crowded with onlookers. Some people, having witnessed the throwing of the bomb at Yongchang Coal Company by someone else and not Yun Huifang, feared that Yun would be wrongly accused and voluntarily came forward to testify. Although Yun was young, she was able to calmly state her case without panic. However, she suffered from a stutter, making it difficult for her to speak fluently, and it seemed to take her a lot of effort to speak for a long time.</p>
<p>Police Lawyer's Statement</p>
<p>First, lawyer Ru stated in detail the articles of indictment and the facts of the two cases, saying that the police are prosecuting the defendant for (1) attempted murder in violation of Article 282, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and (2) obstruction of freedom in violation of Article 318, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The obstruction of freedom occurred on July 27th, and the attempted murder occurred on July 28th. The defendant and a Cai Yaozu lived together at 207 Pike Road. Cai Yaozu had four hand grenades hidden in their residence. On the morning of July 27th at 11:30 AM, the defendant sent a letter written by Cai, along with a can of biscuits containing a hand grenade, to the Cotton Cloth Guild. The recipient was suspicious and opened it, discovering explosives. Fortunately, it did not explode at that time. Later, the guild sent the letter and hand grenade to the police. The guild's tea server Ye Xiaoshan and Zhu Asan can testify that Zhu received the letter. This is the obstruction of freedom. As for the attempted murder, on the morning of the next day, July 28th, at 7:45 AM, the defendant and Cai Yaozu wrapped a hand grenade in paper and sent it to Yongchang Coal Company on Xinzha Road. Cai had previously sent two letters to the owner of the company, Wu Jichang, both written by Cai. They discussed it before carrying it out. They were angry because anti-Japanese member Yan Bin was arrested by the police and sentenced by the court on January 18th for investigating Yongchang's private import of Japanese goods. So, they retaliated with a bomb. Cai held the bomb and threw it into the store, injuring store employee Yu Ruiliang in the lower body. There is a medical certificate from Renji Hospital. On August 5th, the defendant carried another bomb and threw it at Maochang Foreign Goods Store on Republic Road and ran away, and was arrested by Chinese police. She was transferred to the Second Special District Court of First Instance. After the verdict, the police brought her to the police station for questioning. The defendant confessed to these two cases at the police station. They had originally had four hand grenades, but they had only used three. According to the defendant, the remaining one was hidden in a box in their residence. Therefore, the Chinese and Western inspectors took the defendant to search and found the remaining bomb. However, because the explosive material had not been removed, it was not presented as evidence for the time being.</p>
<p>Western Inspector's Investigation</p>
<p>The signed confession of the defendant was then presented as evidence. Western Inspector Glauber then reported on transferring Yun Huifang from the Lujiawan Police Station and searching Yun's residence for bombs, as well as investigating the situation at the Cotton Cloth Guild and Yongchang Coal Company. According to witness Zhu Asan, a tea server at the Cotton Cloth Guild, the person who delivered the letter that day was about 21 or 22 years old. Because the person turned around and left immediately after handing over the letter and the can of biscuits, his face could not be seen clearly. However, he felt that the person was quite short, very unlike the defendant in this case. According to Yongchang store employee Xia Guoxing, on the morning of that day, Yu Ruiliang and the accounting clerk were outside the counter. Yu was squatting down putting on his socks when a bomb was suddenly thrown in from outside, injuring Yu's skin. He is still in the hospital and unable to appear in court.</p>
<p>Judge Inspects the Incident Location</p>
<p>Lawyer Ru, in order to clarify whether the person throwing the bomb had the intention to commit murder, questioned Xia in great detail about Yu's position at the time and the location where the bomb landed. Lawyer Li Zuyu, believing that this point was of great importance to the defendant, requested that Judge Feng personally conduct an on-site inspection to ensure a thorough understanding and fair trial. Lawyer Ru agreed with this suggestion, saying that it would be best to have Yu Ruiliang put on his socks in the original position during the inspection to determine whether a person standing on the road outside the store could see the person inside the store. Judge Feng agreed with this suggestion and announced that he would personally inspect the terrain (today). However, lawyer Zhao Chen argued that the main issue was whether the defendant was the one who threw the bomb. There were people who had witnessed the incident and voluntarily came forward to testify that the person who threw the bomb was not Yun Huifang. Therefore, the identity of the perpetrator was not yet determined. He requested that the witnesses be allowed to testify in court to avoid injustice. Judge Feng agreed to this, but told him that the defendant should be questioned first, and then the witnesses.</p>
<p>Yun Huifang's Testimony</p>
<p>Yun Huifang was then questioned. She stated that she was from Changzhou, 16 years old. Cai Yaozu was from Wuxi and worked in the oil business. We lived together at 207 Pike Road. Cai and I both volunteered for the Shanghai Citizens' Volunteer Army during the January 28th Incident and went to the Baoshan front line. On March 5th, our army retreated to the second line of defense. Cai and I never returned to the army after that. We each took two unused hand grenades back to Shanghai. The purpose of our actions was to warn the bad merchants. We first conducted investigations and found out that Yongchang Coal Company had previously falsely accused Yan Bin and was still privately importing large quantities of Japanese coal. Therefore, we had already sent two or three letters as warnings. The letters were all written by Cai. On the morning of July 28th, we decided to give them a bomb. I got up a little late, so Cai took the bomb and went first. When I arrived, I saw many people gathered inside and outside the store. Whether anyone was injured, I had not heard at the time and did not see clearly. On the 30th, Cai wrote another letter to the company as a warning. Cai and I were in charge of the "Blood Vengeance and Eliminate Traitors" group. The group's emblem has now been taken away by Cai. The bomb at the Cotton Cloth Guild was delivered by me alone. They were secretly buying Japanese yarn and giving money to the Japanese, allowing them to make guns and cannons to fight us. The January 28th Incident was actually caused by a group of traitorous merchants. They must have heard the sound of enemy guns and cannons. But how long has it been before they are again selling large quantities of Japanese goods? My heart aches, so I gave them a bomb. Yun then answered lawyer Li's question, saying that in the army, Cai and I were of equal rank, but Cai was more educated than I was, so we all obeyed him. I only brought two bombs, and they have all been used up. Lawyer Ru then questioned Yun. She answered that the volunteer army I joined had more than 200 people. We fought the Japanese army once. Hand grenades were distributed after we arrived in Baoshan. If the safety pin is not removed, it will not explode. The one I sent to the Cotton Cloth Guild, I didn't remove the safety pin. Although I signed the confession recorded by the police on the last page, I only read the first page.</p>
<p>Testimony of Two Witnesses</p>
<p>Next, Wang Jisheng, an apprentice at Laofengxiang Silver Store on Xinzha Road, testified that after Yongchang Coal Company was bombed, I heard the sound and went out and saw the person who threw the bomb was tall and strong, wearing white, and running east. At that time, I did not see the defendant. Also, Wang Guanqun, the accountant at Xicheng Rice Store across the street from Yongchang, testified that I heard the sound and looked out, and the person who threw the bomb was already running east, so I only saw the back of his head, but it was definitely not the defendant. The bomb that was thrown was only egg-shaped, so the explosive force was not very strong. By this point it was 1 PM. The court adjourned because the victim Yu Ruiliang was not present, so the case could not be concluded and had to be postponed. The defendant's lawyers then requested that the defendant be released on bail. However, police lawyer Ru Bao Yi strongly disagreed, saying that the charge was attempted murder, a serious offense. If this could be released on bail, then almost all criminal cases could be released on bail. He also said that the court should be based on law, not patriotism. The so-called patriots are only suitable for speeches on the streets. Lawyer Zhao rebuked him for not speaking lightly about patriotic events. After a debate between the two sides, Judge Feng decided on a compromise, reducing the duration of the postponement as much as possible and setting the date for continued hearing on next Monday, so that the detention would only be two days. The defendant then abandoned the bail application and was still taken back to the police station by car.</p>
<p>Rescue by Various Groups</p>
<p>Wang Jian'e, representative of the Changzhou Fellow-Villagers Association, expressed an important view yesterday. The Chaozhou Fellow-Villagers Association sent a letter to the Lawyers' Association yesterday, asking them to find a way to rescue her. The Citizens' Union decided to hold a discussion on rescue measures at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the afternoon of the 14th.</p>
<h3>Washington Road</h3>
<p>Incident of Japanese Soldiers Committing Violence</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to the Public Works Department</p>
<p>Requesting Elimination of Unstable Forces</p>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association, regarding the incident of Japanese soldiers breaking into Chen Wanxing Construction Company and committing violence, sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating, "To whom it may concern: According to a letter from Chen Wanxing Construction Company, on the 10th of this month at 11 PM, more than 50 Japanese soldiers, in several trucks and motorcycles, without reason, hacked down bamboo fences and broke into the factory at the intersection of Washington Road and Yangzhou Road. They violently beat anyone they encountered. A 14-year-old mason named Zhao Afang was stabbed in the lower jaw with a bayonet and hit in the chest with a rifle butt, and more than ten workers, including Deng Wenhui, were injured. They forced all the workers to leave the factory and sit silently on Washington Road, and were threatened with a beating if they protested. The incident has been reported to the Yulin Road Police Station. The Japanese soldiers' unprovoked night-time disturbances, intrusion into people's homes, and assault of law-abiding citizens are extremely blatant and barbaric. The association requests that your department immediately make a serious protest to the Public Works Department, demand an apology, provide medical expenses, and guarantee that similar unfortunate incidents will not occur in the future, and protect the rights of taxpayers. Since your bureau allowed the unstable forces of the Japanese to enter the concession, the serious situation from January 28th of this year has been created, resulting in the city becoming ruins, industry and commerce declining, and Chinese and Western trade regressing rather than progressing. After much effort, those involved managed to make the Japanese forced to withdraw their troops because of public opinion, hoping for peace and a gradual recovery of prosperity. Unexpectedly, the Japanese military's inherent barbarity and disregard for your bureau has reappeared today. If we continue to tolerate this, the consequences will be even worse. According to the aforementioned letter, we hereby request that your bureau take effective measures to eliminate these unstable forces to ensure the safety of the citizens in the concession and prevent the prosperity that has been built up over the past 88 years from being completely destroyed by the unstable forces of the Japanese. Respectfully addressed to the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department."</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Northeast Shipping</h3>
<p>The Navigation Administration Detains and Inspects the Yu Da</p>
<p>After the Northeast Customs of the Japanese and the Fake Country were forcibly seized, Chinese ships had difficulty sailing. Some traitorous merchants, seeking convenient navigation, changed to the fake flag, hired Japanese crew members, and even repaired ships in Japanese shipyards. Ship inspections were also conducted by the Japanese. People's hearts were dead, and sovereignty was lost. It is painful to talk about. The recent situation of Northeast shipping is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Flee to Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Huang fled from Yingkou to Shanghai. According to him, the Northeast Volunteer Army has been very active recently, attacking the railway to Yingkou. They have occupied Dashiqiao, which is the main route of the Manchurian Railway to Yingkou. After the Volunteer Army occupied Dashiqiao, the Manchurian Railway's transportation was cut off. Japan has dispatched a large naval destroyer to Yingkou, and 600 marines have landed and are fighting with the Volunteer Army. Chinese businessmen in Yingkou, seeing the Japanese military's indiscriminate arrests and the aircraft's bombing, have been fleeing in the past half month. Five or six hundred people from southern China have taken ships to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Goods Stopped</p>
<p>Our country's blockade of the Northeast Customs has not yet been implemented. Goods shipped from Shanghai to Andong and Yingkou are still taxed as usual, without any changes. Usually, this is the time for large quantities of tea, cotton cloth, paper, and other goods to be shipped to Yingkou. Now, because of the Volunteer Army's attack on Yingkou and the arrival of a large Japanese naval fleet, the Hakka people have completely stopped transporting various goods. Only the Japanese are transferring Toyo cotton cloth from Dalian Bay. Otherwise, all goods are blocked.</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Have Difficulty Sailing</p>
<p>Chinese ships sailing to Yingkou must be forced by the fake country to fly its fake flag. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company originally intended to send the "Tunan" ship to Yingkou. To be safe, the company first telegraphed the branch office there. They received a reply stating that ships flying foreign flags can pass without incident. If Chinese ships to Yingkou are staffed by Japanese, it is still convenient. If the ship belongs to Chinese owners, they will face great difficulties during import and export, and will be obstructed in every way. Therefore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company did not dare to send the "Tunan" to Yingkou.</p>
<p>Yu Da Detained and Inspected</p>
<p>Currently, the Chinese ships sailing to Shanghai, Yingkou, Andong, and other places include those of the Zhengji, Zhaoxing, Haichang, and Yu Da companies. The ships of the above companies all use Japanese as ship owners and chief mates, and the ships also have fake flags. All Chinese ships traveling to the Northeast, starting this year, are repaired in Japanese shipyards in Dalian or Lushun, and the ship inspections are also conducted by the Japanese. Although they are nominally Chinese ships, they have actually been Japanized. The Yu Da Company's "Yu Da" ship entered Shanghai on the 10th and was scheduled to depart for Yingkou on the 12th. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, a crew member named Li reported to the Shanghai Navigation Administration that the "Yu Da" ship was colluding with the Japanese and was repaired in a Japanese shipyard in Dalian. The ship's hull, machinery, boiler, etc. were rotten and could not sail without major repairs. Now, the Japanese shipyard has slightly repaired it and the Japanese have inspected it and released it, only because it has the protection of the Japanese, and it is sailing at its own risk, only for business purposes, disregarding the lives and property of passengers, which is extremely dangerous. Upon receiving the report, the Navigation Administration, believing that the quality of the ship's body is related to the lives of all crew members and passengers, could not take it lightly. Yesterday, it temporarily prohibited the "Yu Da" from leaving port and sent a ship surveyor from the technical department to inspect the ship in detail. As of the time of this report, the inspection has not been completed, so it could not leave port that day. The Navigation Administration will inspect all Chinese ships coming to Shanghai from the Northeast in the future.</p>
<h3>Fake Fengshan Railway Bridge</h3>
<p>Destroyed by the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Company received a telegram from Tianjin yesterday stating that the No. 13 bridge between Gaoshanzi and Qingduizi on the fake Fengshan Railway, due to being destroyed by the National Salvation Army's Second Route Commander Gao Pengzhen, under the command of Zhu Jiqing, was sabotaged by Lao Gedan's unit of the 12th Detachment. On the 8th, the eastbound express train arrived at the location when the locomotive overturned off the bridge. Many Japanese soldiers on the train were killed and injured, and all the firearms were confiscated. The Japanese army was greatly shocked.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Strike Workers</h3>
<p>Yesterday's General Meeting; This Morning's Demonstration to the Company; Expulsion of White Russians; The Company Struggles to Maintain Service; Conflict Occurred Yesterday; The Municipal Party Department Dispatched Personnel Yesterday to Thoroughly Investigate the Truth. After the strike of Chinese public bus workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company in the Public Concession, the company announced the dismissal of all striking workers and attempted to maintain service with difficulty, preparing to recruit new workers. The workers held a general meeting yesterday and decided to demonstrate to the company this morning and expel the White Russians, and the situation is becoming more serious. The detailed situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Situation of the Strike: Since the British-owned China General Omnibus Company posted a notice dismissing all striking workers and ordering them to turn in their uniforms and scattered items, striking workers were nowhere to be seen in front of the company's office on Connaught Road yesterday. Only police officers from the 6th District Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and Chinese and Western detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station were stationed to patrol and provide protection. Drivers, ticket collectors, inspectors, coppersmiths, sweepers, ticket writers, laborers, etc., have not yet been affected and are still reporting to the company as usual, but due to the lack of work, they are all gathered in front of the company's office to rest. Due to the workers' strike, the work of all company employees has increased, extending office hours.</p>
<p>Maintaining Traffic: Factory director and traffic manager Dart is making every effort to maintain traffic for the benefit of transportation. Inspectors and ticket collectors are acting as ticket sellers, and White Russians are driving the buses. Yesterday, 14 buses ran on Route 1 from Jing'an Temple to the Racecourse, 7 buses on Route 2 from Er Yangjing Bridge to the Racecourse, 7 buses on Route 5 from San Mao Ge Bridge to the Railway Station, and 24 buses on Route 9 from Jing'an Temple to the Electric Light Factory, as well as the ABCDE special express buses and the A1 special bus. They returned to the factory early at 8 pm. Police stations notified patrolmen along the route to be on strict guard.</p>
<p>Company Policy: The British-owned China General Omnibus Company's general manager An Li, acting general manager An Zhu Luo, factory director and traffic manager Xiao Da Te, deputy traffic manager Qiang Te Lai, secretary-general Ban Le, and assistant Pi Ya, unanimously decided to adopt a tough policy towards the workers' strike. After announcing the dismissal of the strikers, they also wanted to order the uniforms to be handed in within a time limit, preparing to hire new Chinese and White Russian workers. After training them well, they will gradually find ways to restore public bus services on all routes.</p>
<p>General Meeting: According to the official news from the strike committee yesterday, at 2 pm yesterday, all striking workers, following the order of the strike committee, held a general workers' meeting in the wasteland of Caojiadu. More than 200 people attended. The chairman reported that the company announced the dismissal of workers and recruited a large number of White Russians to replace Chinese workers. The crowd was extremely excited at the time and unanimously decided on the spot: (1) Limit the company to give a satisfactory answer to the conditions within one day and dismiss all White Russians. (2) Gather in front of the company's gate at dawn on the 13th to demonstrate and demand conditions. No bus is allowed to run until the goal is achieved. (3) All participate in the picket team to drive away the scab White Russians who undermine the strike. (4) Immediately convene mass meetings of various departments to discuss the alliance strike contract. (5) Publicly register all unemployed workers and fight the capitalists together to demand jobs and relief. (6) Schedule a reception for reporters to report the progress of the strike and ask for assistance from all walks of life. (7) Issue a notice to patrolmen and annual workers. (8) Determine the time and place of the meeting every day, stipulating that each striking member must report and be assigned work at the contact point of the strike committee every day. (9) Organize propaganda and fundraising teams to raise donations from workers in various industries and compatriots from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Assault Occurred: At 10 am yesterday, foreign ticket inspector Si Dan Men saw a D bus driving without wearing a uniform. He immediately punched him and dragged him into the company. At 10:20 am, more than 40 Chinese drivers gathered to beat the ticket inspector at the company gate, causing injuries. Factory director Xiao Da Te sent him to the hospital by car. All drivers demanded the dismissal of the ticket inspector. Xiao Da Te stated to all drivers that the ticket inspector's unreasonable beating of people violated the rules and immediately dismissed him, advising the drivers to work with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Preventing Traffic: The strike committee announced to the workers yesterday that they should wait for a reply as the company has not yet replied to the newly proposed conditions. However, all workers, seeing that some Chinese staff and White Russians were openly undermining the strike discipline, secretly gathered separately and implemented vehicles on various routes. At the same time, Chinese staff were warned to investigate the numbers of the White Russians in preparation for dealing with them. Yesterday morning, Route 1 and Route 5 public buses were seen by the strike picket team when they were driving to Jing'an Temple Road. They were surrounded and prevented from driving. Several White Russians were beaten at the time. The detectives rushed to disperse them. Last night, the picket team declared to the Chinese staff: (If Chinese staff continue to sell tickets on behalf of the workers tomorrow, they will be dealt with in the same way as the White Russians.)</p>
<p>Party Department Investigates: Since the strike of workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, the Municipal Party Department believes that the workers could not bear the oppression and went on strike, but it has a significant impact on local security and social order. It is heard that at 2 pm yesterday, personnel were dispatched to thoroughly investigate and prepare to cooperate with the Social Affairs Bureau to resolve the issue as soon as possible and avoid prolonging the strike.</p>
<h3>Korean Patriotic Corps Declaration</h3>
<p>Justification for the Dalian Incident: This newspaper received a declaration from the Korean Patriotic Corps yesterday, providing a justification for the Japanese claim that the Corps conspired to assassinate members of the League of Nations investigation team in Dalian. The declaration is in English, stating in brief: The regulations followed by the Corps are to act diligently and not speak. Therefore, it has remained silent on the Japanese fabrication that the Corps conspired to assassinate members of the League of Nations investigation team in Dalian. However, after the chairman of the Corps, Kim Gu, issued a declaration on the Hongkou Park bombing on May 9, the truth was revealed to the world, and the Japanese could not apply their frame-up. Therefore, it is believed that it is necessary to issue a declaration now. Since the Japanese arrested Corps members Liu Xianggen, Cui Yuzhi, and two others in Dalian on May 24, they have publicized to the outside world that the Corps initially planned to assassinate Japanese military and civilian officials stationed in Manchuria, but later changed its plan and attempted to assassinate members of the League of Nations investigation team. Their intention was to put Japan in a difficult position in the international community, provoke a world war, and take the opportunity to seek Korean independence. They also said that the Chinese government and Chinese anti-Japanese groups provided them with funds. The Corps believes that war cannot benefit mankind. We do not hesitate to sacrifice the lives of Corps members and use force to create enemies only because the enemy drives Koreans to death every day. There is no other good strategy to avenge. However, apart from the enemy, we regard the people of other countries as friends. Therefore, no foreigner was injured in the Hongkou Park bombing. If a bomb exploded in Dalian, it can be proved whether members of the League of Nations investigation team or Commander Honjo of the Kwantung Army, Governor Yamaoka of Kwantung, or President Uchida of the South Manchuria Railway died. If we want war, we want to severely damage Japan, the public enemy of world peace. We do not believe that assassinating members of the investigation team can achieve our wishes. As for saying that assassinating members of the investigation team will become an international issue and make it difficult for the Japanese government, we do not know that what we seek is the independence of the country, and we have never had such a despicable idea. We are fighting for justice, and we have not seen any reason to do such an unconscious act of violence for the enemy government. The enemy government really wants to assassinate members of the League of Nations investigation team. We can present the Korean issue to the gentlemen of the League of Nations investigation team, but we believe that it is not the time yet. However, we firmly believe that the gentlemen of the League of Nations investigation team will think that Korea needs freedom after considering the Korean issue. Korea is the key to peace in East Asia in history and geography. The permanent solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute lies in solving the Korean issue.</p>

<h3>Shocking</h3>
<p>New Scam in Shanghai: Counterfeit Check Exchanged for Genuine Bank Draft; Cantonese Woman Defrauded of More Than 7,000 Yuan; Western-Clad Youth's Deception is Miraculous; Cashed in Just Over Ten Minutes. Cantonese woman Hong Wang, over forty years old, lives at 56 Guangyu Lane, Macleik Road, Hongkou, Shanghai. She has quite a bit of savings. Several years ago, she deposited a total of 5,000 taels of silver into the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China for a fixed term, earning interest. Yesterday was the expiration date. Ms. Hong personally went to the bank to calculate her principal and interest, which totaled 5,350 taels of silver, equivalent to 7,776.16 yuan. The bank issued her a Bank of China draft. Ms. Hong left the bank with the draft, intending to deposit it into the Siming Bank. Before she had walked a few steps, a young man in his twenties wearing a Western suit called out to her from behind. She stopped. The young man stepped forward and told her that there was an error in the calculation of the draft and that she was short more than 200 yuan. Ms. Hong believed him and followed him back to the entrance of the Bank of China. The young man took out a check for 8,043.63 yuan from his side and exchanged it with Ms. Hong. Ms. Hong saw that the young man was only wearing a Western-style shirt, resembling a staff member of the bank, so she did not think twice and exchanged it with him. Then, she went out again, took a car, and went straight to the Siming Bank. The bank saw that it was a counterfeit check and asked her where the check came from. Ms. Hong told the truth. The bank told her to hurry back and question him. But when Ms. Hong returned to the Bank of China, the official Bank of China draft had already been cashed. The bank staff said that after Ms. Hong took the draft, a young man in a Western suit came to the bank to cash it in just over ten minutes. The bank cashed it according to the rules of recognizing the draft but not the person, and he left. Ms. Hong wanted to pursue the matter, but it was too late. Alas, the world is going downhill, and the road ahead is full of thorns. It is truly lamentable.</p>
<h3>Guo Luman's Bigamy Crime</h3>
<p>Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment with a Two-Year Reprieve: Guo Luman did not legally divorce his wife Han Yuezhen but held a wedding ceremony with Xu Zhiqi, a statue girl from the Town God's Temple. Han filed a bigamy lawsuit against Guo through the police. At the same time, she also sued Xu, Xu's uncle Guan Chen, matchmakers Lian Jiming and Xing Chunhua for knowingly marrying and helping bigamy. Xu also sued Guo, Han, Han Meisheng, and Hu Miaosheng for arranging a marriage, resulting in as many as six lawsuits against each other. Now, in view of the unfavorable situation, the parties conducted a settlement. Except for the police's bigamy case against Guo and the prosecutor's indictment against Han Meisheng and Hu Miaosheng for perjury, the remaining lawsuits were withdrawn separately. Guo was responsible for the litigation costs of all parties. Subsequently, the police raised objections because the prosecutor's lawsuit against Han and Hu violated the agreement. This has been reported in this newspaper many times. Now, Judge Feng Shide of the criminal court handling the case ruled that the prosecutor's perjury complaint violated the procedure and rejected it. Therefore, only Guo's bigamy case remains. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng continued to hold a criminal court hearing. First, Han was asked whether the advertisement in the newspaper was posted by her. She denied it. Guo Luman firmly insisted that he had divorced Han and that the settlement only dealt with the distribution of property and did not mention his identity. Mr. Feng believed that the case was very clear and ordered the debate to begin. After the police lawyer Ru Baoyi and the defendant lawyer Wu Dengzi debated each other, Judge Feng announced the judgment in court. Guo Luman was sentenced to one year imprisonment for the crime of bigamy, with a two-year reprieve. The remaining lawsuits were not accepted.</p>
<h3>Ominous Ancient Pot</h3>
<p>One Pot Has Four Owners; Pledged for a Thousand Gold Coins; Wang Jisan Sues in Court; Wu Daonan Imprisoned. Hunanese Dai Yao, before Zhang, pledged an ancient pot to Wang Jisan for 1,000 yuan for a period of six months, which was extended for another two months. As the deadline was approaching, Dai was afraid of being confiscated by the pledgee, so he asked his friend, Anhui native Wu Daonan, to find another pledgee to increase the pledge price so that he could repay Wang's money. Wu agreed to find a way. On the 9th of last month, they went to Wu's home at 17 Ronggui Lane, Edward Road. Wu took the pot out to find a recipient, but he did not return for a long time. Wang suspected that Wu was trying to embezzle it, so he reported it to the New Gate Police Station, saying that the ancient pot was taken away by Wu and his accomplices. The head of the police station sent detectives to Wu's home. Since Wu had not returned, Wu's wife, Chen, and Pan Shoushan were arrested and sent to the court for interrogation on suspicion of helping to loot, and they were given light punishment. Now, the police have learned that Wu is hiding in Room 503 of the Huizhong Hostel. They sent detectives to arrest Wu and the ancient pot yesterday and sent them to the First Special District Local Court. There were as many as four people fighting for the ownership of the pot. Each of them hired a lawyer to come to court and state their reasons for being entitled to it. After Judge Feng questioned them, he ordered Wu Daonan to be detained and rescheduled the hearing. The ancient pot was temporarily stored in the court's stolen goods warehouse for safekeeping, pending verification.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities</h3>
<h3>Suggests Improving City Telephone</h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Ordered the Telephone Bureau to Draft Detailed Measures: The city's telephone service has been in operation for many years, but due to the failure to improve it as much as possible, it is difficult to develop the business, and the public also feels inconvenienced. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications had planned to convert to automatic telephones early on and signed a purchase contract with the American Automatic Electric Company in the winter of the 18th year. It has been two and a half years since then. Except for the part of the line in Hunan, Shanghai, which has been sorted out, Zhabei, Pudong, and other places have not yet started construction. Moreover, the telephone companies in the concession areas have installed telephones in Hunan, Shanghai, Zhabei, Pudong, and other districts in the city, originally based on the telephone contract signed between the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the former Shanghai Huayang Telephone Company. Now that the contract has expired, it should have been taken back in theory, but in fact, there are still many residents in the Chinese area who request to install foreign telephone lines. For the sake of both national sovereignty and user convenience, the only way is to actively improve the telephone in the Chinese area and the communication methods between the Chinese and concession areas, so as to make residents happy to install the telephone in the Chinese area. Based on the above reasons, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities proposed (1) to complete the conversion of automatic telephone projects as soon as possible, (2) to improve the arrangement of the relay lines for communication between the Chinese and concession areas to avoid delays, and (3) to reform the charging methods for communication between the Chinese and concession areas. It was submitted to the Municipal Government for referral to the Ministry of Communications for adoption. It is now known that the Ministry of Communications has ordered the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to draft detailed measures for implementation and submit them for approval.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway to be Completed</h3>
<p>Minhang Ferry to be Completed on Schedule; The Entire Road to be Opened to Traffic Next Month: The Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway has been actively underway since its construction began. The section belonging to Shanghai County uses the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road, which is commercially operated, as the highway. Other counties that have been under construction have also been completed in order. All the ferries in Minhang were previously entrusted by the Jiangsu Construction Department to the Municipal Public Works Bureau to recruit workers and build them. It has been twenty days since then. It is scheduled to be completed next month, so the entire road is scheduled to be opened to traffic in September. The cost of the Minhang Ferry is estimated to be more than 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wusong</h3>
<h3>Civilian Memorial Village to be Constructed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Maintenance Association previously planned to allocate 30,000 yuan to build a Civilian Memorial Village in a suitable location designated in Paotaiwan, Wusong, so that the generally impoverished farmers could have a place to belong. The farmers in the four townships learned that the construction of the memorial village had a designated location, which would inevitably hinder the farming work of the farmers who lived farther away. Therefore, they jointly requested the Wusong Municipal Committee to find a way to change it, building the memorial village's funds on the original house bases of the poor households in the four townships. Then, the farmers would have a place to belong and facilitate field work, which would be a win-win situation. Municipal Committee Tang Chengzong believed that the farmers' request was reasonable, so he discussed it with the Local Maintenance Association and agreed to investigate the number of extremely poor farmers in the area. There are 217 households. The construction methods have been determined and are being contracted by the Oriental Construction Company. Construction can begin separately within these few days. It is heard that the government will borrow funds to build houses for the farmers who are the second poorest in the future.</p>
<h3>International Trade Association Writes to Three Major Companies</h3>
<p>Requests that National and Non-National Goods be Listed Separately: The China International Trade Association wrote to the three major companies, Wing On, Sincere, and Sun Sun, requesting that the national and imported products they sell be listed separately and indicating their place of origin so that customers can choose. The original letter states: "We are writing to inform you that in recent years, China's overseas statistics show an increasing trade deficit, and the people will soon be impoverished and their wealth exhausted. People with insight believe that using domestic goods is a way to save the situation. Although there are many types of domestic goods, merchants often neglect marketing methods, so those who want to use them still have difficulty choosing. Your company has a passion for marketing, which our association has long admired. The sixth meeting of our association's board of directors has decided to request that your company set up a special department for domestic goods on any floor, gather domestic products from all over the country, so that patriotic men and women can choose them. If it is difficult to set up a special department due to changes in the original organization, then we propose that in any department, all imported products should be gathered in one place, clearly marked with their factory name and location. In this way, customers can freely choose according to their preferences, and entrepreneurs can also use it to examine their advantages and disadvantages and seek improvements. This is just a simple task for your company, but it will have a great benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood. It also fits your company's long-standing intention to promote domestic goods. Therefore, we are sending this letter specifically for discussion. We hope you will consider it and look forward to your reply."</p>

<h3>Change of Name of the Chemical Analysis Office of the Inspection Bureau</h3>
<p>Renamed Chemical Industrial Products Inspection Office: The Chemical Analysis Offices set up by the Commodity Inspection Bureaus in various places were renamed as Chemical Industrial Products Inspection Offices, abbreviated as Chemical Products Inspection Offices, as resolved by the Second National Commodity Inspection Conference. With the approval of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Commodity Inspection Bureaus in various places were ordered to comply. After receiving the order, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau decided to change the name of the original Chemical Analysis Office to the Chemical Industrial Products Inspection Office from the 20th of this month. It has been separately notified to the Jianghai Customs Tax Affairs Department and merchants in the fertilizer, tung oil, sugar, and vegetable oil industries for reference.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Guangdong National Salvation Association Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Report on the Inspection of Enemy Goods: Ma Huayi, the director of the secret investigation section of the Guangdong People's National Salvation Congress, was ordered to come to Shanghai on official business. Yesterday, he went to the Shanghai Federation of Organizations at 89 Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, to meet with Yin Zhiling, the executive director of the congress. He reported that the Guangdong National Salvation Congress has always been strict in inspecting enemy goods. Traders who transport enemy goods must be fined 50 times the price of the goods. Officials who engage in bribery and corruption of more than 100 yuan must be sentenced to death. Therefore, the execution of Peng Chusheng in the past and the wanted order for Peng Juesheng today are both executed in accordance with the association's charter. As for the Yongyuan Line matches in Shanghai, which were seized in Guangdong, they were inspected by the Agricultural College of Zhongshan University and found to be no different from enemy goods. However, because the transporters applied for a reinvestigation of the origin of the goods, they came to Shanghai to investigate whether the goods were manufactured by Yongyuan Line in Shanghai and where their raw materials came from to show caution. Mr. Ma went to Beijing on official business last night and will return to Shanghai tomorrow. When he arrives, he will also contact the National Salvation Congress of various organizations to discuss matters.</p>

<p>The Bean, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grain Industry Closes Down to Mourn; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Holds a Public Memorial Service: After the death of Ye Huijun, a member of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and a leader in the rice industry, all sectors expressed their condolences for Ye's elderly age, great virtue, and contributions to his hometown. The Jiangsu-Shanghai Municipal County Rice Industry Association, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Guild, the Miscellaneous Grain and Oilcake Industry Guild, the Rice Milling Industry Guild, the Rice Store Industry Guild, and the Miscellaneous Grain and Oilcake Exchange have jointly initiated a memorial service to be held at 2 pm today at the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Guild at 377 Minguo Road. Many members of various organizations in the city participated.</p>
<p>Closing Down to Mourn: Ye was the chairman of the Bean, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grain Oilcake Industry Guild and also presided over the affairs of the Miscellaneous Grain and Oilcake Exchange. Therefore, he contributed the most to the bean, rice, and miscellaneous grain industries. The industry has notified all members in the city to close down to mourn for the memorial service held today. The Miscellaneous Grain Exchange will also suspend trading for one day.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Public Memorial Service: Ye was a director of the former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai County Chamber of Commerce. When the Shanghai merchant groups were unified and organized, Ye, Wang Xiaolai, the current chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Yansong, the standing committee member, made the most efforts. After the Merchant Group Consolidation Committee was established, Ye served as a standing committee member of the committee. When the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was formally established according to law, Ye was elected as a standing committee member. After the first term expired, Ye was re-elected as a standing committee member. It was not until he died in office that a supplementary election was held. Now, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that Ye worked hard for commercial transportation and did not spare any effort. It has issued a notice to all executive and supervisory committee members to gather at the Miscellaneous Grain Guild at 2 pm today to hold a public memorial service.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Memorial Text: On July 15th of the 21st year of the Republic of China, Mr. Ye Huijun, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, died at his residence in Shanghai. On the 13th day of the following month, the various rice industry groups jointly held a memorial service at the Miscellaneous Grain Guild. Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Yansong, Bei Songsun, Yu Zuoting, Lu Wenzhao, and all the executive and supervisory committee members attended the meeting to express their condolences and prepare a clear drink and delicious food to pay tribute to his spirit, saying, "Alas, making a name in wealth began with Duanmu Ci. Surviving Lu and breaking Qi, riding in a group, has continued from the Han Dynasty to the present. The legacy of the past is almost lost. Analyzing benefits like autumn hair, political affairs are not discussed. Only your rise changed the Han banner. Seeking you in the market, you stand out from the crowd. In the late Qing Dynasty, the government lost its order. Three households destroyed Qin, and uprisings spread everywhere. At this time, you clearly made up your mind, mobilized soldiers, and secretly repaired military equipment. The Shanghai incident broke out, and you were given an important mission. You settled it in one fell swoop, and the Qing officials fled. You have worked hard without boasting. You have a position worthy of my actions. You have been in the market for thirty years, emphasizing righteousness over lightness of profit, satisfying warmth and fullness, and not seeking savings. Your integrity and high morals are unparalleled in the world. Compared to Tao Zhu, how can you be worthy? The public expects you to lead the association, discussing benefits and harms, and showing sincerity. Where public justice lies, you are willing to refuse complaints. The integrity of Cao, the currents are raging. I am ashamed to be a junior and get to rely on you. Fortunately, I have avoided mistakes and have been blessed by you. Heaven has taken the old man, and you have been abandoned. Hundreds of wastes are waiting to be revived, and they have lost their support. The success of nine Ren is not just a reeds. Hearing the news and being sad, private and public friendship, I respectfully dedicate a glass of wine. The Milky Way sheds tears, judging its style. Appearing in dreams, I hope that the old friend can comfort my sorrow. Enjoy."</p>

<h3>Sanmen Bay Port Opening Company</h3>
<h3>Yesterday's Gathering at the Chamber of Commerce for Various Sectors</h3>
<p>Representatives Reported on the Opening of the Port and Plans 　　Free Ship Provided to Welcome Participation in Inspection, No Fee Charged. The Sanmen Bay Port Development Company hosted various sectors at the City</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Auditorium at 4 PM yesterday. Over sixty people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Xiaolin, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yansong, Yuan Ludeng, Wu Guangzong, Xu Yiheng, Wu Liguo, He Bingxian, Zhao Jinqing, Wu Zhihao, Zheng Chengqing, and others. Xu Tingzu chaired the meeting. The details are recorded below. 　　Representative Deng Zhenquan of the Sanmen Bay Port Development Company reported, "Today, our company has invited everyone to the Chamber of Commerce to report on our company's port development policies and steps, and to seek advice from everyone. Despite the hot weather today, you have all graciously attended, demonstrating your concern for industry and your deep affection for our company. We are deeply moved by your kindness." 　　Origin of Port Development. "Today's report is roughly divided into two points. The first point is our company's port development policies and history. The economic panic in our country is partly due to the impact of the global economic panic, but it is also due to the lack of development of mineral resources and the inconvenience of transportation, which has led to the underdevelopment of industry and commerce. Mr. Xu Tingzu, I, and several other original initiators of the port development project wanted to do something practically beneficial for the country and society. Therefore, in 1929, we initiated the proposal to open a commercial port in Sanmen Bay. Sanmen Bay is located between Wenzhou and Xiangshan, only a hundred miles away from Tiantai Mountain. The land is fertile and the products are abundant, serving as the gateway to several counties in eastern Zhejiang. In particular, the Haiyou River Xunjianshi Mountain area, which our company plans to develop into a commercial port, is the most suitable. The water surface in the Xunjianshi Mountain area is extremely flat and the water is very deep, capable of accommodating large ships of several thousand to tens of thousands of tons. It is a very good harbor in eastern Zhejiang. Because our country is vast, no one has paid attention to this place. During the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, Italy once requested to lease it as a naval port, but the Qing court refused. Only then did the Chinese people become aware of its name. In 1922, our overseas Chinese planned to return to China to open a commercial port in Sanmen Bay, but it was shelved due to the continuous military conflicts in the country. Mr. Xu and I deeply knew the importance of that location and the abundance of resources. The development of a commercial port would not only meet the urgent needs and demands of the people, but also develop industry and increase national tax revenue. After we initiated the port development in 1929, we received the support of the gentlemen of the Chamber of Commerce, and the government specially approved Mr. Xu to undertake it." 　　Past Achievements. "Mr. Xu has been solely responsible for the past four years, and has completed the measurement of land and water routes. Several lighthouses, docks, and warehouses have been built. In order to seek precise and accurate overall planning, it is inevitable that it will take more time. Recently, Mr. Xu has been running several businesses of his own, and his energy cannot be spared. In view of the fact that there are many enthusiastic industrialists and construction comrades who are willing to participate in the joint undertaking of this matter, Mr. Xu is willing to transfer the exclusive right to undertake it to the company, so as to facilitate the concentration of talents, joint efforts, and early success. I am originally a military man and do not know business. However, Mr. Xu invited me to join him as the initiator, and encouraged me with the great righteousness of saving the country through industry. Publicly and privately, it seems difficult to ignore. Therefore, I began to participate and assume unlimited responsibility." 　　Expansion Plan. "The reorganization of the company has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan for approval. The company's share capital is 2 million yuan. 60% of that is undertaken by unlimited liability shareholders and the remaining 40% is being subscribed to. Once fully subscribed the company will officially be established. We will actively proceed according to the original plan. The second point is that the original plan is divided into three phases." 　　Implementation Steps. "The first phase is to handle land and water transportation. First, rent a 1,000-ton steamer to travel between Shanghai, Sanmen Bay, and Fuzhou, transporting passengers and goods from various counties near Sanmen Bay to Shanghai and Fujian, making Sanmen Bay the main port for the surrounding counties. At the same time, build a road to Tiantai, connecting with the provincial road that Zhejiang Province will soon complete, and build a part of the necessary roads in the city. Other items such as building hotels, docks, warehouses, transshipment companies, and building short-wave radio stations are all matters to be handled in the first phase. In the second phase, when transportation has become convenient, the population of the commercial port will have increased. Build 1,000 city houses, increase one large steamer and one small steamer, operate storage and beverage facilities, add and repair city roads, and operate electric lights, city telephones, and long-distance telephones. These are all matters to be handled in the second phase. The third phase of the plan includes the development of mineral resources, fishing and salt fields, agricultural reclamation, forests, and water supply companies. The scope is larger and requires a huge amount of money. Our company alone cannot handle it. At that time, we can only choose the items to be held based on our own financial resources, or add more capital, or form another company to help each other build. In short, Mr. Xu, I, and our colleagues at the company know that this kind of business is complex and difficult to handle. However, we have forgotten our insignificance and are determined to engage in it because we deeply feel the trust of the government, the kindness of the gentlemen of the Chamber of Commerce, and the earnest expectations of the people. We can only pledge to do our best to do it, step by step. We hope that you will not hesitate to provide guidance at any time, and we hope that the gentlemen of the Chamber of Commerce will continue to support us. In the future, if our company achieves a little success and the people near Sanmen Bay receive a little benefit, it will all be thanks to you." 　　Welcome to Visit with an Attached Report. "Our company wants</p>
<p>to enable comrades from all sectors who care about construction and industry to inspect Sanmen Bay as soon as possible. Therefore, we will first use Mr. Xu's Yili Company's Yili ship to send gentlemen from all sectors to Sanmen Bay for on-site inspection on the afternoon of the 18th of this month. All gentlemen who have attended today's meeting have officially received letters of welcome. Please take the trouble. If you have any friends who wish to go with you, please introduce and notify them. Our company welcomes them all. This trip will stop in Sanmen Bay for two days, and then go to Putuo for a tour, also stopping for two days, before returning to Shanghai. The ship is fully equipped, and we have requested a warship from the Zhejiang Provincial Government to protect it along the way. The trip is very safe. After this inspection trip, our company will rent another ship in the near future to run between Sanmen Bay, Shanghai, and Fuzhou, to facilitate transportation." Subsequently, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, and others gave speeches in succession (details omitted). 　　Participation Instructions. The procedures and itinerary for participating in the inspection tour are as follows: (1) Send a letter to the Sanmen Bay Port Development Company to register. (2) The Sanmen Bay Port Development Company will give a welcome ticket. (3) At 4 PM on August 18, present the ticket at the Sanmen Bay Company reception at the Dada Wharf for verification and reception. No ship fare will be charged and food will be provided.

<h3>Japanese Ambassador Yano Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Shiwen News Agency reports that Yano, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy in China, left Beijing for Tianjin on the afternoon of the 4th of this month and arrived in Shanghai on the Fengtian Maru on the 8th. He arrived at the port at 3:30 PM the day before yesterday (the 11th). Many officials from the Japanese authorities in Shanghai welcomed him, including Japanese Consul Murai and First Secretary Horiuchi. After Yano landed at the Huangpu Wharf, he immediately took a car prepared by the Japanese Consulate and drove to the Consulate to rest. Yesterday afternoon at around 2 PM, Yasui, the acting chairman of the Japanese Residents' Group in Shanghai, and Lin Jixiong, the chairman of various business associations, visited him one after another, requesting Counselor Yano to publicly report on the current situation of Japanese expatriates in Tianjin and the local Chinese people's resistance to Japanese goods. Yano expressed his intention to report everything in detail at the Japanese Club on Wenshi Road the day after tomorrow (the 15th).</p>

<h3>Huang Fu</h3>
<h3>Resigns as Director of the Palace Museum</h3>
<p>The Central Political Council approved the appointment of Huang Fu as the Director of the Palace Museum.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Regarding this matter, Huang Fu sent a telegram from Mogan Mountain to President Wang. The original text is copied as follows: "President Jingwei, I read in the newspaper that the Central Political Council has approved my succession as the Director of the Palace Museum. I have been in the South for many years and have been out of touch with the museum's operations for a long time. I will not be able to travel north in the near future. The museum's affairs are of utmost importance and must be handled by someone who can be stationed in Beijing full-time. If the newspaper report is true, I hope to be exempted from the appointment and that another capable person is selected to facilitate the facts. I am grateful."</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Public Association</h3>
<h3>Refutes Xiong Shihui's Winter Telegram</h3>
<p>"Governor Xiong of the Jiangxi Provincial Government in Nanchang, upon reading your winter telegram, we are extremely surprised. The points of conflict between your implementation of the special goods production and sales, bandit suppression and post-disaster donation, and the central laws and regulations are detailed in the Telegram Jia. Even with a hundred mouths, I am afraid you would have no way to defend yourself. Now, after the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Finance to investigate and order the revocation, you still argue persistently. The concerns expressed in Telegram Jia, that you would compete with Wang Anshi in his three shortcomings, have unfortunately come true. We are not deaf or blind, and we are well aware of the true situation in our hometown. Why would we be isolated from the truth just because we are far away on the coast, or be quick to blame you based on the alarmist tales of a few merchants who do not understand the general situation? The taxes of a usurious nature cut off the national economy and suppress legitimate tax sources. If it is only levied in one province, the danger is even greater. A handful of goods from Jiangxi Province cannot compete with the same goods from other provinces because of the heavy taxes. Merchants will deplete their capital due to sluggish sales, and farmers and workers will stop working due to sluggish sales. It is tantamount to destroying production on one's own. Even in normal times, it should not be hastily implemented, let alone in the midst of the most severe banditry. You are alarmed by the banditry, but do you know that the destruction of production is the source of the spread of banditry? Once production is destroyed, the people will have nothing to eat or wear, and they will inevitably take risks. This is the main reason why bandits can coerce farmers and anesthetize young people. It cannot be ignored. Since the collection of this donation, in addition to the merchants and people of Nanxun calling for its cancellation, the two towns of Zhangshu and Jingde were filled with righteous indignation and had no choice but to resist. Even if you can use the military police to suppress them for a while and force them to submit, if hundreds of industries are unable to maintain themselves in the future, those who depend on them for a living will all have the possibility of being coerced and anesthetized by bandits. The so-called 'suppressing bandits appropriately leading to breeding bandits' in Telegram Jia is indeed not like the worries of the man of Qi. No matter how tight the provincial treasury is, it should not take this inferior policy of drinking poison to quench thirst. The Winter Telegram states that the estimated annual revenue from this donation is only over two million yuan, and most of it must be used for bandit suppression and post-disaster relief. The actual amount that can be used to increase security teams is only over 900,000 yuan. The content of the so-called bandit suppression and post-disaster relief is unknown. It is heard that the annual cost of establishing administrative districts is over 300,000 yuan, which is not only not permitted by law, but also does not help in fact. Extorting in this way is meaningless. Increasing the security teams, you may consider it an important plan to strengthen the self-defense force. However, the troops stationed in Jiangxi have been no less than 200,000 to this day, and they still cannot prevent the attacks and movements of the Red Bandits. Who will believe that increasing the eight security teams will be able to take on the heavy responsibility of suppressing bandits? As for the desire to support several divisions of troops to establish the power of their own local chieftains, we have not heard that the villagers have any doubts about you in this regard. A snake in the cup is a mere shadow. Is this not being overly sensitive? The Winter Telegram states that the economic situation in Jiangxi Province has deteriorated since the abolition of the customs tax last year due to the unrest of the bandits and the disruption of transportation. This is indeed true. Is the unrest of the bandits and the disruption of transportation any different from last year? You are inflicting a disguised customs tax. Isn't the economic situation becoming more and more exhausted? According to reliable sources, various industries in Nanchang have agreed to stop importing goods from August 1 and have announced that they will follow the central government's orders and stop paying donations. Can you cover up the eyes and ears of the world with one hand and say that this is all because the villagers are unkind and evil? Frightening them with power will incite a civil uprising. What will you rely on without fear? The Winter Telegram repeatedly elaborates on Hu Yongzhi's implementation of the customs tax, as if to compare yourself with the ancients. You do not know that the army that launched the eastern campaign by land and water was mostly gathered in Wuhan, and the supply of military equipment and food, and the recuperation of wounded and sick soldiers, were all taken from there. Therefore, the people understood his plight, and the Qing court listened to his plan. In recent times, there have been many people who have thought of being Hu Yongzhi before you, but none of them have been able to ask for it. There is no other reason. The situation is different now than it was in the past. You implement this donation, not only is the tax item being taxed repeatedly, but the purpose is not urgent. Just in terms of procedures, you do not follow the legal track and instead rely on the resolution of the bandit suppression meeting to forcibly collect it, issuing notices, implementing the detention of ships and goods in advance, and the four borders are in turmoil. Not to mention the illegal passage, people are talking about it. May I ask, on what basis does the bandit suppression meeting obtain this kind of authority? I am afraid that you will be unable to respond to this. During the period of political tutelage, the people have no way to exercise their sovereignty. Those who preside over provincial affairs should especially consider the people's suffering, sympathize with the people's difficulties, and respect public opinion as the standard for implementing policies. If you do not do this, and instead use obstinacy as courage, and use extortion as a good plan, and consider words that are unpleasant to the ears as generating unnecessary disputes, it seems close to the tone of being aggressive. I am afraid that you will come to save Jiangxi, but will leave to harm Jiangxi, which is not what the people of Jiangxi expect from you." Li Liejun, Zhang Dingfan, Sun Jingya, Xu Suzhong, Xu</p>

<h3>Special News from the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>"Jianghua," a river steamer owned by Zhaoshang, seized a batch of smuggled opium on the Yangtze River. The ship came from Wuhan to Shanghai on Wednesday, docking at Jinliyuan Wharf. As usual, opium suppression inspectors and water patrol teams boarded the ship to check for contraband. Inspectors from the water patrol station found a batch of smuggled opium, totaling more than 300 taels, inside the cabin and in the concealed compartment of the toilet on the "Jianghua." No one claimed ownership at the time, and the crew and waiters also claimed ignorance. The water patrol station immediately confiscated the opium and took it back to the station to report. Meanwhile, they are investigating the main offender of the smuggling. 　　The Driving Association, which prohibits the use of Japanese coal in the shipping industry, found that a certain shipping company in Shanghai had secretly purchased 40,000 tons of Japanese coal and sold it to various ships. They sent a letter to the Shipping Association, asking them to order all companies to not use "enemy coal." Yesterday, the Driving Association received a reply from the Shipping Association, stating that they had already distributed the original letter to all members, informing them to stop purchasing "enemy coal." They have also asked to investigate the facts of the company that secretly purchased Japanese coal and announce them to the public.</p>
<h3>Anhui Residents in Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Oppose Private Collection of Provincial Bonds by Departmental Officials</h3>
<p>"Since Ye Wenlong, Director of the Anhui Provincial Committee and concurrently Director of the Finance Department, came to Shanghai, it has been rumored that he intends to borrow 3 million yuan from the banking community in Shanghai. When Anhui residents in Shanghai heard about this, they believed that this kind of borrowing had not been decided by the provincial government, had not been agreed to by the people, and the purpose was not disclosed. Relying solely on the private activities of one or two departmental officials, disregarding the burden of 30 million people, they would never acknowledge this. After receiving the report, the Anhui Fellow Villagers' Association sent a letter to the banking community, asking them not to be deceived. They also convened a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on the 15th to discuss the handling procedures. It is heard that the Anhui Business Promotion Association in Shanghai also convened a general meeting yesterday. As a result of the discussion, they sent a telegram to the central government, asking for a thorough investigation and strict prohibition. The original telegram said, (omitted above). Since the era of Ma Lianjia, the head of Anhui Province, he arbitrarily borrowed 5 million yuan from the Anhui branches of the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China. The people of Anhui could not bear the burden, and it has become an outstanding issue to this day. Therefore, although successive warlords have searched and plundered in many ways, they have ultimately failed to achieve anything in terms of borrowing because their credibility has been lost. Therefore, although the people of Anhui have been repeatedly searched and plundered to this day, and are living in deep water and scorching fire, they still have a glimmer of livelihood because they have no provincial debt. If politics can be brought back on track one day and properly reorganized, it will not be difficult to recover. Last year, they suddenly suffered an unprecedented flood, and two-thirds of the people in 60 counties have been reduced to fish and turtles. For the sake of supporting life and rescuing the dying, the people of Anhui are still unwilling to borrow, because if this example is set, those in charge of politics will use it as an example, and from then on, 30 million people will fall into a situation of utter ruin. Moreover, the borrowing this time was not decided by the provincial government in advance, nor was it agreed to by the people, and the purpose was not disclosed. Only one or two departmental officials are acting secretly. This is tolerable, what is not tolerable? We urge you to thoroughly investigate and strictly prohibit this. 30 million</p>
<p>people depend on it."</p>
<h3>The Issue of Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen Telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to Send Personnel to Negotiate</p>
<p>The tobacco and alcohol license tax in Jiangsu Province should, in principle, be collected directly by the Ministry of Finance. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Government once handled it on its own due to financial constraints. Later, the Executive Yuan decided that, in order to maintain the uniformity of tax administration, it should still be taken back by the Ministry of Finance for handling. Previously, Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, came to Shanghai in person to negotiate everything with Song Ziwen. At that time, it was decided that the Jiangsu Provincial Government would send personnel to negotiate with the Tax Administration. Unexpectedly, the Jiangsu Provincial Government suddenly telegraphed to all counties to pursue the payment of tobacco and alcohol license taxes. Therefore, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen specially telegraphed Gu Zhutong, asking him to immediately withdraw the order and send personnel to Shanghai to negotiate with the Tax Administration immediately. Xie Qi, Director of the Tax Administration, also telegraphed Gu, urging him to send personnel to Shanghai to facilitate the reorganization. The two telegrams are recorded separately below. 　　Minister of Finance Song telegraphed Governor Gu Mosan of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang, "Strictly confidential. The business license tax for tobacco and alcohol in Jiangsu Province has been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be handed over to this Ministry for handling. And I have agreed with you in person in Shanghai. Recently, I read in the newspaper that your Provincial Government has issued a telegram to all counties, pursuing the full text of the license tax, which I am deeply perplexed about. In order to maintain the uniformity of tax administration, this Ministry will not allow two different types of tax collection procedures. Regarding the license tax that the Jiangsu Provincial Government should allocate, if it does not conflict with the 19% agreement, this Ministry will try its best to discuss it within the possible scope and allocate it according to the regulations. Please send personnel to Shanghai immediately to contact and resolve the matter with the Tax Administration of this Ministry, so as not to cause more and more disputes, and both national and local taxes will be affected. I have always admired your efforts to maintain tax administration. I hope you will understand this. I look forward to your reply." Song Ziwen bowed and sealed it in Jiang. 　　Director Xie telegraphed Governor Gu of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang, "I respectfully received the telegram issued by the Minister. I am delighted to learn that Secretary Yu Shao of the Finance Department has been sent to the department to contact you regarding the tobacco and alcohol license tax in Jiangsu Province. The Su Province license tax urgently needs to be reorganised and I hope that Secretary Yu will be sent at once. I beg you to come to the department to negotiate harmoniously. I also pray for a reply. Sincerely yours, Xie Qi, Director of the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance. Zhen Yin".</p>
<h3>The Amnesty Case Will End by the End of September</h3>
<p>The Local Court is Handling the Case. Since the official promulgation of the Amnesty Ordinance, the courts in Shanghai have successively implemented it in accordance with the Ministry's order. The First and Second Special District Courts have also completed the procedures one after another. Yesterday, according to Wang Xun, the Chief Clerk of the Local Court, told the reporter of the East China News Agency that the court is actively handling the case day and night after receiving the amnesty order. It is expected that it will be completely completed and executed separately in about a week. However, all matters concerning the amnesty were previously ordered to be completed and reported for closure by the end of September.</p>
<h3>Using Inferior Goods to Remodel Chinese Products</h3>
<h3>Dishonest Merchants Arrested in a Hotel</h3>
<p>Cai Zhenxiang and Cai Zisheng, brothers from Xiashi, set up the Lifengchang Yarn Shop on Fabre Avenue in Shanghai. They usually specialize in selling Japanese goods. Since the severance of relations with Japan, they have already made a lot of profit. Recently, they have been transporting Japanese yarn, falsely claiming it as Chinese goods, remodeling it and transporting it to Xiashi for sale. This was verified by all sectors of the Party, government, and business in that area. They held a joint meeting and decided that Cai and others, at a time when the wounds of the Shanghai battle were still unhealed, still persisted in their evil ways, selling enemy goods to make profits, which was a heinous crime. It was decided to fine them 2,000 yuan and issue a warrant for the arrest of Cai Zhenxiang and others to bring them to justice. Cai heard the news and fled to Shanghai, still engaged in the business of selling enemy goods. He remodeled Japanese yarn, falsely claiming it as a product of the Qinfeng Yarn Factory, and transported it to other places for sale. The owner of the Qinfeng Factory learned about it and was furious. Because Cai and his brothers dared to mix enemy goods with Chinese goods, falsely using the Qinfeng trademark to harm others, he immediately sent personnel to various railway stations and ports to conduct strict surveillance. As a result, seven pieces of inferior yarn falsely claiming to be Qinfeng Chinese goods were found at the South Railway Station. He immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau, which detained the goods, took photos, and offered a reward to purchase the arrest of Cai and his brothers. Yesterday (12th) afternoon at 4 PM, someone secretly reported that Cai and others were hiding in room 516 on the fifth floor of the Central Hotel on Wuma Road in the British Concession. He immediately reported it to the police station and sent detectives to arrest Cai Zisheng. Cai Zhenxiang had already fled upon hearing the news. Cai Zisheng was taken to the police station and will be sent to the First Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Peiyin Shi, A Woman from Yangzhou</h3>
<h3>Accusation Against Xu Ji'ping for Kidnapping Son</h3>
<p>Housewife and others persuade her to send her son to a relief home. The relief home suddenly claims he was taken away by a Nanjing person. Pei Yinshi, a woman from Yangzhou, is 41 years old, comes from a poor family, and works as a servant. She has a young son, Pei Sanzi, who is nine years old. He is always by her side, and Pei Yinshi loves him very much. On February 6th of last year, Pei Yinshi was working as a servant at the Xu family at No. 22 Yuanchang Lane, Hualong Road. Her mistress, Ms. Xu Ji'ping, said that it was very inconvenient for Pei Yinshi to bring her son with her. Through the introduction of Xu's younger brother, Renji, and relative Pan Keping, Pei Yinshi was told to send her son, Pei Sanzi, to the Nanhui Relief Home for adoption. This would save her the trouble of taking care of him and providing food and clothing. Secondly, when he grows up, she can still take him back. Pei Yinshi was originally worried that her son had no future. Now that she had the introduction of her mistress's relatives, she was told to send her son to the Nanhui Relief Home for adoption, and when he grows up, she can take him back to support her in her old age and burial. Overjoyed, she followed her mistress's wishes and sent her son, Pei Sanzi, to the Nanhui Relief Home for adoption. However, the love between mother and child is a natural instinct. This spring, Pei Yinshi missed her son very much and told her mistress that she wanted to go to Nanhui to visit her son. Ms. Xu Ji'ping, the mistress, tried to stop her in every possible way, saying, "Your son is doing very well in the relief home. Why do you need to go see him?" Because Pei Yinshi wanted to visit her son several times, but was stopped by her mistress, suspicion arose in her heart. Until recently, she entrusted someone to send a letter to Zhang Jianqian, the director of the Nanhui Relief Home, to inquire about the recent situation of her son, Pei Sanzi. She soon received a reply stating that Pei Sanzi had been taken away by Zhang Huating from Nanjing on November 17th of last year. Pei Yinshi was shocked upon receiving the letter. Because she sent her son to the relief home for adoption through the introduction of her mistress's relatives, Pei Sanzi had a guardian. How could the relief home allow anyone to take away someone else's son at will? After thinking it over and over, she believed that her mistress, Xu Ji'ping, her younger brother, Renji, and relative Pan Keping, had colluded to commit kidnapping. Therefore, she hired lawyer Li Yuan to accuse Xu and Pan in the Second Special District Court based on Articles 257 and 258, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. After one summons, the hearing was postponed due to incomplete witnesses. Yesterday morning, the court summoned them again and opened the trial in the First Criminal Court. The plaintiff, Pei Yinshi, accompanied by her agent lawyer, Li Yuan, appeared in court and stated the previous situation. The defendants, Xu Ji'ping, Xu Renji, and Pan Keping, hired lawyer Hu Jue to defend them. In court, they stated that they did not admit to colluding to commit kidnapping. The judge believed that the case was not yet clear and needed further investigation, so he ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Pu Heping's Tragic Murder of His Paramour</h3>
<p>Although the means were cruel, the circumstances are somewhat excusable. The police lawyer requests a lenient sentence. Pu Henian, a Qingpu native residing at No. 825 Dongxi Huade Road, at 12:15 PM on the 9th of this month, out of resentment that his paramour, Wang Xiuying from Jiangsu, took advantage of his financial difficulties to have an affair with others, forcing Pu to write an agreement to separate and claiming "cut ties with no loose ends, or else face the consequences," which greatly angered Pu. He then used a kitchen knife to kill her. The case was discovered and he was arrested, taken to the Huishan Police Station, and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong continued the trial in the Fourth Criminal Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin made a statement, saying that the police are now prosecuting the defendant for murder by dismemberment and dissection under Article 284, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. He then presented three photos taken by the police during the autopsy of the victim as evidence. In court, the defendant was questioned: "When did you meet Wang Xiuying?" (Answer) "March 24th. I met her on the boat from Jiangsu to Shanghai. We had never met in Jiangsu before." (Question) "What were you doing in Jiangsu this time?" (Answer) "I went to Jiangsu to find my father and look for work because I was unemployed. I didn't find him, so I went to Shanghai." (Question) "Do you know Wang Xiuying's background?" (Answer) "I don't know. I only heard that she had an affair with a bathhouse attendant in her hometown." (Question) "You and Wang Xiuying were not formally married, but rather illicit lovers. Why did you use such cruel and poisonous means, cutting her more than twenty times? Where was the first cut?" (Answer) "The neck. The rest I can't remember because I was in a daze at the time." (Question) "Wang Xiuying's left hand was almost completely severed. What was your intention?" (Answer) "I don't know." (Question) "Why did you close the door before committing the crime?" (Answer) "Because the kitchen knife was behind the door, so I locked it." (Question) "Why were you so ruthless?" (Answer) "Because she took advantage of my financial hardship to force me to break off my engagement and have an affair with others, forcing me to write a separation agreement. I was extremely angry and killed her." (Question) "Who else is in your family?" (Answer) "Only an elderly father, and no siblings." The court determined that the facts were completely clear and appointed a lawyer to defend the defendant pro bono. The defense began, and police lawyer Zhang claimed that according to Article 284, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the defendant should be sentenced to death for murder by dismemberment and dissection. However, the circumstances of this case are different, and the defendant suffered a great sacrifice for the victim. His fiancée broke off the engagement because of Wang Xiuying, and she disliked him for being poor, so she had an affair with others, forcing him to write a separation agreement. Moreover, the defendant did not rely on her for a living, but worked as a vendor selling Rentan, earning a profit to provide for her. However, the defendant's methods were too cruel, and Wang Xiuying died too tragically. The lawyers also went to the morgue to see the body. But considering the circumstances, there are still excusable factors. He requested a lenient sentence. Prosecutor Zhan also stated that he agreed with the police lawyer's request. Finally, the defendant's pro bono lawyer also requested a lenient sentence. Judge Shen ordered Pu Henian to be remanded in custody pending judgment.</p>

<h3>Tobacco Dealers Oppose Increased License Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Branch of the Municipal Tobacco Dealers Association held its second</p>
<p>representatives' meeting yesterday. More than 20 people attended, including Chen Kunxian, Ye Yinfang, Chai Yasheng, Zhang Bingyuan, Mi Ji, and Qiu Tanglin. Qian Wenda was elected chairman and Zhang Songji was the recorder. They discussed the tobacco and alcohol license tax for the 21st year. The Tax Bureau now invites merchants to bid for the contract. The bidding was opened in Beijing on the 4th of this month. The quota for the two counties was set at 77,620 yuan. Wang Zhaosun (i.e., Wang Yao) of the Industry Transportation Company bid 90,120 yuan, exceeding the quota by 12,500 yuan, which Wang won. The meaning of his increased bidding is to increase the national tax revenue in name, hoping to win the bid, increase the tax collection, but in reality, to enrich private interests. Increasing the tax amount will inevitably increase the burden on the tobacco and alcohol industries. The representatives all said that since the January 28th Incident, the commercial market has not yet fully recovered, and the suffering and losses have been unspeakable. The license tax item has been disputed between the central and provincial governments and has not yet been resolved. If a bureau is set up to increase the collection, it will be impossible to recognize it. If the tax is collected according to the 20th year tax amount, it should be paid willingly, otherwise, it should be handled according to the last resolution (submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for safekeeping), or join the sauce and wine, sauce garden, Liang Shao earth yellow wine and other industries to reach a consensus. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Wu Youru Missing Case</h3>
<p>Wu's family arrests Shi Aru</p>
<p>No. 18 Maiyu Lane, French Concession, where Ningbo native Wu Yousheng (i.e., Wu Asi), who runs a peddling business, went to Shi Aru in Hekang Lane, Nine Acres, at 9:00 AM on the 8th to collect a loan of 240 taels of silver. He has not returned since, and there has been no news for several days. Wu's family went to Shi's place to inquire, but Shi suddenly claimed that he had not seen Wu for more than a month and denied owing the money. Wu's wife and nephew, Wu Caibao, were extremely anxious and went to the British and French police stations and the Municipal Public Security Bureau to request an investigation. The day before yesterday, Wu's family suddenly received a letter by post stating that he had been assassinated. Wu's wife read the letter and burst into tears, filled with grief and indignation, and fainted several times. Wu's wife went to Shi's place yesterday morning to report the arrest and brought Shi under control in the Second District and First Station. After the station chief interrogated him, Shi confessed that he had borrowed 240 taels of silver from Yousheng before, and later borrowed 400 yuan from a friend to repay Wu. Later, the police were sent to inquire about the friend, but Shi did not borrow 400 yuan from him. His confession was evasive. As the case involved human life, it was immediately submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Trade Association News</h3>
<p>National Medicine Industry: The Executive Committee of the Shanghai National Medicine Industry Association specially convened a general meeting of members yesterday and issued a special notice to all members, stating: "Notice regarding the expiration of the term of office of the first Executive Committee of this Association. Therefore, at the previous general meeting of members, it was planned to handle the re-election. However, due to the insufficient number of members present to meet the legal quorum, and at that time, the labor unrest was surging, the majority of members advocated that the original committee members should continue to be responsible for dealing with the situation to make them familiar with the matters in hand, so the election could not be held immediately. It has been almost a month since then. Now, the labor unrest has temporarily come to an end, and the Municipal Social Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, etc., have repeatedly sent letters to this Association, urging the election to be held. Moreover, since the sudden resignation of Mr. Zhang Meian, a member of the Standing Committee of this Association, rumors have been rife in the outside world, and many actions have been unfavorable to this Association. This concerns the organization of the group and the interests of the industry. Under this severe situation, this Association also has the need to convene a general meeting of members as soon as possible, so as to express its attitude and jointly discuss countermeasures. (Omission) Now it has been decided to legally convene a general meeting of members at 2:00 PM on the 27th of this month to handle the re-election, and to discuss various important business matters, and the progress of the amendment of the contract will also be reported to the public at the same time to comfort the expectations of the industry. We hope that all members will appreciate the deep concerns and difficult circumstances of the committee members, and attend enthusiastically at the appointed time to jointly save the difficult situation and quickly plan relief measures. If they continue to procrastinate and are absent, resulting in a small number of people and the meeting is adjourned, then the committee members will only have to resign jointly to apologize to our industry. This is a sincere notice, and we hope you will take note of it." Conveners: Chen Chuxiang, etc., Executive Committee members of this Association. Sugar, Foreign Goods, North and South Grocery Industry: The Joint Market of the China Road Sugar, Foreign Goods, North and South Grocery Industry Association held a joint meeting of executive and evaluation committee members at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. Eleven executive committee members and ten evaluation committee members attended. Chairman Qiu Yangzhi presided over the meeting and resolved the following cases: (1) The North Goods Industry sent a letter requesting assistance in dealing with the debts of Hengxingmao, etc. in Songjiang. The resolution was: (A) The market's industries will jointly send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which will forward it to the Songjiang Chamber of Commerce. Although the goods are handled by the Zhuangke (broker) when the inland South Goods stores apply for goods from Shanghai, the payment is directly responsible by the goods store. Hengxingmao, etc. should be ordered to quickly repay the debts of Shendingtai, etc. to maintain the established rules. (B) The market's industry members will temporarily suspend transactions with Hengxingmao, etc. and Zhuangke Jiang Jinru. If anyone is found to be handling goods in their name, the same countermeasures will be taken. If any industry is found to be acting outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient, they will be expelled from the market. The above two items will be sent to each industry for investigation and implementation. (2) Prohibit the private operation of inferior goods in the market's industries. The resolution was: A letter will be sent to the unions of each industry to strictly prohibit their members from privately operating inferior goods. If anyone is found to be in violation and the facts are confirmed, they will be expelled from the market. In addition to sending letters to each industry for investigation, a public announcement will be published in the newspaper. (3) The market's admission certificate should be taken in a strict manner to prevent counterfeiting. The resolution was: The new admission certificate for the 22nd year must be stamped with a seal and a hard seal to prevent counterfeiting and to show seriousness. Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Industry: The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Industry Association issued a public notice to the guilds yesterday, stating: "Since the Wanbaoshan case occurred last year, this Association convened a meeting of the industry on July 24th and decided on four measures to deal with Japanese goods, which were submitted to the Social Bureau for approval and implementation. At the same time, it was notified to the industry to refuse to purchase and load. All foreign rice must be registered in detail by this Association for verification at any time. On May 6th and July 22nd of this year, this Association reiterated the previous resolutions and decided on punitive measures. If anyone is found to have privately ordered goods from Japanese merchants or loaded Japanese ships, they will be expelled from the association. If they are still secretly interacting with them, the same measures will be taken. All of these are sufficient to show this Association's determination to automatically resist Japanese goods. However, recently, newspapers have reported the private purchase of Japanese rice by Tongxingtai, Rentai, and San. Recently, a letter was received from the "Soul除奸团 (Spirit of Removing Traitors Group)", ordering a thorough investigation to clarify the truth. The Association's year of efforts to resist Japanese goods has still not been able to gain credibility from the outside world. It is impossible not to feel heartbroken to talk about it. Since the Japanese have obtained the East Province and disturbed North China, they are approaching step by step, wanting to destroy our China and then be happy. All those who have blood and spirit should realize this as soon as possible and strive for unity. If anyone is still driven by their own private interests and does not care about being spurned by all parties, they are directly following their personality and isolating themselves from humanity. I hope that my colleagues will hold on to the spirit of never yielding as long as there is a breath left, and restrain each other, and do not shame our hearts. This is a special and earnest warning. I hope that the guilds will understand this and respect their personality and never waver. If anyone deliberately neglects or tries lightly, once verified, they will be dealt with according to the agreement, and there will be no leniency. This is of utmost importance."</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Respectfully, I read in your newspaper's local news column yesterday that the Da Chang Establishment was setting up a medical clinic and dispensary, with District Chief Chen Fengpu appointed to manage the finances, etc. Upon investigation, our district chief is Lu Fengpu, not Chen Fengpu. In addition to District Chief Lu generously donating 30 silver dollars, the remaining funds were raised through solicitations from various parties. The report slightly deviates from the facts. I am writing to request that your newspaper promptly make a correction. With best wishes for your well-being, respectfully addressed to the esteemed editor.

<h3>Cooling Off with a Gramophone Record</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Among those seeking coolness by the water's edge, there is an old lady who is a lifelong vegetarian, three innocent and charming young ladies, and Mr. Zhang, who has traveled extensively. "Mr. Zhang, you've been to the outside of the Great Wall. Tell us some strange tales from there." "Three Ladies, you want me to talk about exotic flavors again. I'll briefly discuss the situation in Mongolia." "Second Uncle, you're experienced and knowledgeable, with a belly full of exotic tales that can never be exhausted." "Old Sister-in-law, don't put the coal basket on my head. I lived in Mongolia for four or five years. I went there during the late Qing Dynasty and returned in the third year of the Republic. Is the national strength of China getting worse year by year? When I first went, the Mongols truly revered the Han people like deities. As soon as they heard the sound of cartwheels, even in the dead of night, the natives hiding in their yurts would come out to welcome the Han guests, offering them their warm and comfortable yurts with stoves, while they themselves would huddle under the guests' carts overnight. But when we returned after the Revolution, the Mongols no longer treated the Han people with such respect. Now, it's even less so!" "Mr. Zhang, are Mongolian women like us?" "Completely different. Mongolian women never bathe all year round, but their skin is still white. Because they constantly eat mutton and drink milk, the accumulated dirt on their skin is transferred to their clothes, so their skin is not very filthy. Only their close-fitting shirts are oily and greasy, unbelievably dirty. One set of clothes could probably yield three pounds of tallow candle fuel." "Three Ladies, don't ask him to talk about exotic flavors. Listening to it makes people nauseous. He only picks the dirty and disgusting things to talk about." "Old Sister-in-law, who has been a pure vegetarian all year round, and never cooks meat, only whets her appetite with mushroom soup. Old Sister-in-law, these mushrooms grow outside the Great Wall. Whenever Mongols discard excess mutton and milk in the sand, mushrooms will grow in that area. You should know that mushrooms are also dirty and disgusting." "Three Ladies, pour the leftover mushroom soup into the river. I won't eat mushrooms anymore." "Good Grandma, don't believe him. Mr. Zhang's words are always half true and half false."</p>
<h3>Tales of a Returnee from Shenyang</h3>
<p>— Jin Feng</p>
<p>My cousin, Mr. Chen, works for a certain company in the North Gate of Shenyang. Recently, he returned south due to the passing of his parent. The commercial markets of the Northeast have always relied on the support of people from within the Great Wall. Since the violent Japanese occupation of Liaoning and Shenyang, there has been deep concern that people from within the Great Wall would abandon their businesses and return south. Therefore, checkpoints are densely set up at key transportation points. Anyone who has not been granted permission by local officials appointed by Manchukuo is not allowed to leave Shenyang and enter the Great Wall. Violators are treated as spies and may be subject to the death penalty. Therefore, anyone wishing to leave Shenyang must bribe and scheme to obtain a permit. Mr. Chen has been in Shenyang for over five years and knows several Japanese vagrants. These vagrants have now mostly become officials of Manchukuo. Knowing that Mr. Chen was returning to Shanghai due to the death of his parent, they helped him obtain a permit and took the Fengshan Railway to enter the Great Wall. It is estimated that from the time he boarded the train until Shanhaiguan, he was inspected five times along the way. During the inspection, he was always asked what his nationality was. Mr. Chen always replied that he was a Manchukuo citizen or a Fengtian person. The inspectors would then briefly search and leave. One passenger, when asked about his nationality, replied that he was from Shanxi. The inspector was furious, slapping him hard on the cheek. He then asked what he was doing entering the Great Wall. He replied that he was returning home to visit his relatives. The inspector slapped him again. Later, his luggage was opened, and a letter was found. The inspector read it for a while, then grabbed him by the collar and left, punching him hard in the back as he went. At that time, the people in the same car were all terrified, but none of the seven Chinese dared to show the slightest anger. Moreover, these seven people</p>
<h3>Fire Bath</h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>Bathing must be done with water; everyone knows that. Using fire instead of water has never been heard of before. During the Battle of Shanghai, after the 19th Route Army retreated due to exhaustion, the reinforcements from the rear also arrived successively. The 47th Division of Shangguan Yunxiang was stationed in Xiyi, west of Yu Mountain. After settling in, they clamored to find bathhouses among the local people. Villages are as dense as the feet of birds compared to cities. The people either bathe in basins or pots (huge iron pots specifically for bathing). There are no public bathhouses. Since they could not find bathhouses, they reluctantly settled for pots or basins. However, the utensils were small and could not be shared. The people then sought excessive supplies. Helplessly, they purchased firewood from the people and burned it in a circle. Dozens of people stood naked inside, receiving the smoke and heat. They said it was incomparably comfortable. These men liked bathing, probably for a reason. The military expenses had been in arrears for a long time. Even when they were paid, the amount was very small. A first-class soldier received one dollar, and those below received only a few cents. Since they were not even given their salary, their uniforms were naturally old and worn out, without any new replacements. Being old and worn out, they had not been changed for a long time, so lice swarmed. Suffering from lice all day long, their skin naturally itched terribly. Only bathing could relieve their suffering. In severe cases, scratching would break the skin, and water would cause extreme pain. Therefore, it was not as comfortable as cauterizing with fire. Hence, the 47th Division created the unheard-of fire bath. From beginning to end, no one dared to whisper a word. Each carriage was stationed with one or two Japanese spies disguised as passengers. If they saw Chinese people talking to each other, they would be labeled as enemy spies and arrested. Mr. Chen said that what the Japanese feared most was our country's irregular army, namely the Volunteer Army, the National Salvation Army, etc. After Shenyang was occupied by the Japanese, they tried their best to paint a picture of peace. However, once night fell, martial law was imposed every day. Posts were set up on main roads, as if facing a formidable enemy. The period after September 18th, for one or two months, was especially tense. At that time, Japanese and Korean vagrants would often drink wildly until midnight, staggering home. If the guards asked for the password and the vagrants did not know how to answer, they would be mistakenly killed. This happened three or five times every day. Recently, with the growing strength of the Volunteer Army, the wind howled and the cranes cried. Shenyang was alarmed several times every night. Whenever the sound of gunfire was heard, Japanese expatriate women and children would flee in panic, causing a disturbance until dawn. For example, during Mr. Chen's journey on the Fengshan Railway, the train stopped abruptly six times. The Japanese soldiers accompanying the train got off to patrol, but found nothing each time. Seeing snakes in cups and tigers in the market, the Japanese thought that the Volunteer Army had laid a dragnet, and their embarrassed situation was both laughable and hateful.</p>
<h3>Interpretation of Suzhou Proverbs</h3>
<p>— Rice Farmer</p>
<p>Proverbs and dialects vary from place to place and time to time. The three characters "毋乃渹" not only are no longer spoken today, but also no one knows their meaning anymore. There are many old proverbs in Suzhou. Old Suzhou Prefecture belonged to nine counties and sixty-four townships (the old nine counties were Wu, Changzhou, Yuanhe, Wujiang, Zhenze, Changshu, Zhaowen, Kunshan, and Xinyang. Today, Changzhou and Yuanhe have been merged into Wu County, Zhenze has been merged into Wujiang, Zhaowen has been merged into Changshu, and Xinyang has been merged into Kunshan). Among them, there are old proverbs that are only used in the nine counties and sixty-four townships, and no one else says them or knows their meaning. There are also those like the three characters "毋乃渹" that are about to disappear. The summer days are long, and there is nothing to do in the study. I occasionally extract genuine Suzhou proverbs that are not used elsewhere and interpret them one by one. Perhaps it can also be a small help to those who are visiting Tiger Hill, Lion Grove Garden, and the Mi and Lu Terraces. Guanyin Mountain Sedan Chair People Carry People Guanyin Mountain is located more than thirty miles outside the Jinmen Gate of Wu County. During the spring outings, women who climb the mountain often hire painted boats to go out of the city and land at the foot of the mountain. They often hire mountain sedan chairs, with two villagers carrying each one. There are no three people to alternate. There are also women and children who join in to earn money. Every year in February and March, the residents at the foot of the mountain rely on this income for a year's expenses. The saying "people carry people" implies that the person sitting in the sedan chair is a person, and the person carrying the sedan chair is also a person. It contains a sense of emotion and also implies the idea of reciprocity. South Moat Colored Silk North Moat Lantern There are north and south moats under Jinchang Pavilion, which are the most prosperous areas of Suzhou City. The shops are lined up closely, and the population is dense. All kinds of local products are gathered from all over. During the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras of the former Qing Dynasty, when the imperial system was at its peak, every time there was an imperial National Day, it was beautifully called "sharing joy with the people." The residents of the moat often tied red, green, and five-colored silk fabrics and hung them on the main streets for people to watch. The north moat hung various lanterns, and there was a competition to show off their strangeness. They hired famous craftsmen from Lihu Lake to make fresh silk lanterns, which were changed every few days and nights, causing much trouble and expense to the people. After the Tongzhi and Guangxu eras, this custom disappeared. In the twenty-first year of Guangxu, when Empress Dowager Cixi was sixty years old, it was held once again, and it was extinct from then on.</p>
<h3>New Method of Training Airplanes</h3>
<p>— Gao Qian</p>
<p>In modern warfare, airplanes have become indispensable weapons. We especially felt the need for airplanes during the Battle of Shanghai. In order to resist airplanes, it is necessary to use anti-aircraft guns, and also to have powerful airplanes to fight the enemy in the air. Now there are two new and strange methods to train airplane aerial shooting, so that shooters can get accurate aiming.</p>
<p>The first method is used by the British Air Force, which uses a long rope, one end of which is tied to an empty bag (like the windsock on an airport), and the other end is connected to the tail of the airplane. When the airplane flies in the air, the bag floats far behind. Then, the shooter in another airplane treats the bag as the enemy airplane and shoots at it. Another method is used by the American Air Force, which uses a long rope to tie a large flag, which hangs under the airplane. When the airplane flies, the flag has heavy objects hanging below it, so it only hangs far below the airplane and will not fly up. A large airplane is painted on the flag (as big as the real one). The shooter in another airplane treats it as the enemy airplane and shoots at it. We check the bullet holes on the flag to know whether the shooter is aiming accurately.</p>
<h3>Records of Sights and Sounds of the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>Guanghe Ju Guanghe Ju is located in the north and south Ban Jie Hutong of the city. The shop is not very spacious, but it is famous for its historical traces. During the early years of the Daoguang era, the world was at peace, and the people were prosperous. At that time, the elites of the capital were living in the south of the city. When the official duties were free, and the pleasures of the world had not yet begun, the scholars and officials spent their leisure time in a few cramped, humble, and simple taverns. The entertainment of fellow officials and friends was here. The entertainment of officials from the capital and officials from other places who came to the capital to pay tribute was also here.</p>
<p>The food prices were low, and there was no need to pay in cash. Even when the accounts were collected at the end of the year, only a small part was paid, not the whole amount. This is according to what the old servants in the shop said, so everyone called it convenient. Zao Wen Shaguo Ju was also an old shop in Beiping, but its customers were princes and young rascals, so its name was not elegant and was not mentioned by gentlemen. There is no way to verify its historical traces. The customers here were capital officials, and many of the capital officials were men of letters. Therefore, it was praised in poems, and it was comparable to Fanlou in Bianjing in history. Xia Suntong's annotation on the poem "Feeling Old" says: Since the Daoguang era, the gatherings of famous scholars and literary scholars have taken place here one after another. Mr. He Zizhen lived in the south and regarded it as his outer kitchen. The poet Sun Guancha once discussed the friendship of four generations with him and said that the old debts could be traced back to sixty or seventy years ago, and they were not counted. Guanghe Ju was important at one time because it could represent the power of southerners living in the north. In general, the power of northerners permeated the inner city, and their customs of clothing, food, and drink were always incompatible with those of southerners. Southerners, even when in the north, had to form their own society, preserve their own customs, and establish their own power. In the past, Wang Su did not drink milk (see Luoyang Qielan Ji), and Mao Xiu was able to make southern food (see Biography of Mao Xiu in the Book of Wei), so the different customs of northern and southern diets have been unavoidable since ancient times. Until today, southern food has become more popular than northern food. Although this is just a small detail, the relationship between Guanghe Ju and the rise and fall of the power of the north and south cannot be said to be insignificant. The most popular southern dishes in the shop are Pan fish, Wu fish, Jiang tofu, Han elbow, and Tao vegetables. Xia's annotation on the poem "Feeling Old" also details them. The cooking was mostly passed down from southerners, or labeled with their surnames. Pan fish was Yao Rushi Bingnian. Wu fish was Wu Runsheng Junjin. Jiang tofu was Jiang Yuntao Shu. Recently, Han Lishe, a bureau official, taught how to make braised pork knuckle in a pot, which is also enough to match. It is called Han elbow. In the past, Tao Fuxiang, a vice minister, had steamed belly pieces, called Tao vegetables. It did not start in Guanghe Ju, and now only the ancient recipe remains. Other families have lost it. Five Willow Fish is the method of Song Sao. The business situation of Guanghe Ju is recorded in the annual registers. By carefully reviewing them, it can be known that the shareholders were the Shen family from Shandong, with a large population, which had to be divided equally. Even the shop employees had to share the interest according to their shares. It is also a matter of economic system that can be studied in a hundred years. Record the following paragraph to summarize the others. Chef Sun Ji set off in the fourth year of Tongzhi, with a share of 1.45%. If he earned less money, it would be calculated at 150,000 yuan, not a long-term support. The salary was 6,000 yuan, and in the fifth year, he received 23,404 yuan, and in the sixth year, he received 30,905 yuan. The relationship between the employer and the employee was like this, which is probably why it has lasted for so long. The current shopkeeper, Guo Chunhua, started as an apprentice and has personally witnessed the changes over the decades. After hardships, he has become more refined. Even during the days of the old capital's ruins, he can still support it and not fail the hard work of those who started the business and passed it on. When the shop was first established, it only had the current gatehouse. Later, it was expanded several times to have a scale. But in general, it is still a hundred years old. According to Mr. Guo, candle slaves have been replaced by electric lights, and tin pots have been replaced by . He has seen these changes himself. Try to take out his old utensils and display them. It is like a warm dream. A small shop, but the traces of a hundred years can be found everywhere. Expressing feelings and revealing hidden emotions, where else can you go?</p>

<h3>Gold Market Full of Twists and Turns</h3>
<p>Changes are too numerous to grasp. Yesterday's gold market still had violent fluctuations, with raging waves and no sign of calming down. Traders were at a loss. Although there was an eight tael recovery throughout the day, there were still twists and turns at the opening, and there were still many buyers and sellers. In the end, there was a slight drop of a few cents. The initial opening was still flat. Although the silver market surged again, the forward silver price fell back, which caused the drop. However, the raw market once plunged more than ten taels, once breaking the 700 tael mark. Later, exchange rates became different, with British currency strong and American currency flat. However, there were still changes from time to time. It seemed that there were many buyers in the market, so the price rose and recovered to 718 or 9 taels. The market outlook was heavy and tired. The exchange rate turned down, and the selling pressure increased, so it dropped by five or six taels, nearing the 710 tael mark. However, the chaotic state makes it difficult to speculate. The details of the past situation before and after the market are recorded below.</p>
<p>In the morning, the raw market plunged wildly. The early opening for September was 712 taels and 8 cents, the same as the previous day's closing. The big bar surged to 1.0625, and the American silver also rose by 1.75 cents. As a result, before 9 o'clock, the raw market had already fallen to 695 taels, due to the urgent sale by Hongxing. Hongkang Yongna bought it in, but only about 70 bars. Then, 14 bars were sold at 700 taels. It was learned that the private telegraph had fallen by 1/8, and the exchange rate had also fallen by 1.25 cents. In an instant, buyers crowded in, and the price rose by 10 taels. When the market officially opened at 9 o'clock, it added 2.8 cents, then decreased by 3 cents. However, Hengchang Yongyuan, Dayong Hongkang, Yongheng Xingyuan, Hengxing Bingxing Hengyu Yifeng, and Yongdeng were eager to buy, and jumped by more than 4 taels, to 17.2 cents. It seemed that exchange traders had slightly moved towards settlement. It was estimated that banks such as October British Gold, American, and Japanese sold 1925, and Mai Bank sold October American Gold 31.25. Then, HSBC absorbed November 3125, but Zhifeng Yongheng Yu Yifeng and other goods were put on sale, and Bombay sold August American Gold 31, and then it fell back by 3 taels, totaling 14 taels. At 9:30, the first order opened unchanged, and American Gold decreased by 125, at 16 and a half taels. Yifeng Yong Yuanxing Yongfu Yu Hengxing Tongfeng Heng Hengxing Yuanyuan Tai, etc., all entered, and in November, American Gold was still 3125. HSBC absorbed the near-term first order 3125. In just a few minutes, it rose to 28 taels and 9 cents. After a while, Fuxing Yong Yuanheng Yong Fengchang Yuhe and others all came out, and October British Gold 4375, September American Gold 1875, Old Citibank came out December 31.5625, so the market seemed loose. At 10:20, it was 14 taels and 5 cents. Daxing Yongfu Tai Heng Yuantai Yuanda Yong Yucheng Yong, etc., all entered, and the price was one or two taels up and down at times. Then, the market rose by three or four taels, until at 11:30, it was 18 and a half taels. In a moment, Hengyu Bingxing, etc., sold out, at a loss of two taels. Later, because Hengyu Yuanheng Yifeng Yongyuan Mao Hengxing Yuan Hengchang Yong and others went to the market to compete for purchases, and even fellow traders went to grab the exchange rates, it was estimated that American Gold in August was 875, and September was 9375. People were firmly profitable, so that the market price recovered 2 and a half taels, and at 11:45, it was 19 taels. After entering, many retail longs sold out, retreating to 16 taels and 3 cents. At noon, it closed at 16 taels and 8 cents, and did back to less than 16 taels. The result was only a drop of 5 cents. The market opened at 14 taels and 6 cents in the afternoon, but the goods were already doing small, and there were still many sellers. Then, it suddenly added about two taels, to 15 and a half taels. However, people's hearts were not good. Hengyu Yuanda Yong Zhifeng Yong Hengchang Yong all sold tirelessly. Also, with American Gold trending loose, Mai Bank came out with September 25, October 375, and immediately dropped by 3 and a half taels, to 12 taels. At that time, Dadecheng Fuxing Yong Yuanxing Yong, etc., bought in. September American Gold seemed good, doing 31.1875 against it, and October 3125. At 2:40, it was 13 and a half taels. After the recovery, there was a sudden fatigue, and American Gold became stronger. December required 6875. Also, Huabi bought October Shilling 1.9625, and then August 625, with the entry and exit being the same. On the platform, there were always many sellers. It was estimated that Qianchangxiang Hengyu Zhifeng Yong Zhaofeng Chang Daxing Yong, etc., all sold. At about 3 o'clock, it finally became 11 taels. Then, it went upward, because Zhifeng Yong Zhaofeng Chang Daxing Yong Hengxing, etc., bought in. In less than 20 minutes, it jumped up 4 taels, to 15 taels and 3 cents. After entering, it showed a softening trend again, but there was only a small amount of around one tael. After 3:30, the market was eager to supply, so it fell to 12 taels. At 4 o'clock closing, it was 12 taels and 3 cents, only down 5 cents compared to the previous day. Later, it did small numbers again, at 11 taels and 56 cents (that is, the goods closed at 11 and a half taels). According to the whole day's maximum price of 19 taels and the minimum price of 11 taels, there was a difference of 8 taels (that is, according to the list price). The bare bar was estimated to add 10 taels. The quoted price was mostly suppressed by four or five taels. The quoted price was estimated to be 787 taels. American Gold was quoted small at 125, with an estimated suppression of 70 taels to 68 taels. At noon, it was 70 taels. In the afternoon, it was 72 taels to 756 taels, which was 45 taels more than the previous day. The ledger was recorded twice (double settlement price), 17 taels at noon and 12 taels at night. The water supplement was also the same. The trading was crowded. The trading on the platform was very crowded, but it was chaotic. It was estimated that Hengxing, Hongkang Yong, Yifeng Yong, Qianchangxiang, Daxing Yong, Yuantai, Tongfeng Heng, Futai Heng, Hengxing Yuan, Yuanda Yong, and Hengchang Yong all entered. Tong Taichang, Shunli, Zhifeng Yong, Yuanheng, Ruixing, Yifeng, and Fuxing Yong all came out. Dadecheng hedged and came out, totaling 1,560 bars. Also, customers bought in more than 1,000 bars. Hengyu Fuyu, Bingxing, Wanmei, Zhaofeng Chang, and Yuhe frequently went in and out, and the situation was very busy. In the afternoon, Zhifeng Yong, Zhaofeng Chang, Daxing Yong, and Hengyu re-entered, and Yifeng Yong, Heng Shunli, Yuanxing Yong, and Da Cheng all entered. Hongkang Yong, Yuanda Yong, Wanxing, and Qianchangxiang all came out. The bank came out with more than 500 bars that day and bought in more than 400 bars. Guang Bang, such as Hengxing, entered 1,000 bars, while those who sold out, such as Yifeng, only accounted for 300 bars. Speculators entered and exited differently.</p>
<h3>Premium Slightly Up and Down</h3>
<p>The market situation is not weak. Yesterday's premium market still fell sequentially. The weakness of the recent three days is difficult to describe. But yesterday, because there were tens of thousands of sales on the customer side, the market atmosphere was actually vivid and full of life. The long-term slump was reversed. Although there was no great atmosphere, it was still quite commendable. The price drop was actually caused by supply exceeding demand. The premium fell again, and the discount went up (foreign premium). The early market premium was 6 cents 8 minutes 7 cents and a half, slightly smaller than the previous day's noon market by 1 hao and 2 hu and a half. The noon market suddenly continued to fall by about 1 li, to 6 cents 8 minutes 6 li 6 hao and 2 hu and a half. As a result, there was a strong drop of 1 li between the two markets. (Silver discount) Both the early and noon markets were 8 minutes, which was 2 points higher than the previous day. The situation also felt better, so the head-up plus water had a market of 78 points. Jiang Jiao fell into the Guan. Someone in the Jiangnan Small Foreign Small industry was calling to sell, but no one accepted it. The market price fell into the 6 cent mark, smaller than the previous day by 7 hao and a half, to 5 cents 9 minutes 9 li 7 hao and a half. No one competed in the noon market, so it was the same as the early market. The transaction was 5,500 jiao in the early market and 2,000 jiao in the noon market. Guangdong Little Foreign was completely the same as the previous day's early market, estimated to be 5 cents 8 minutes 2 li. The early and noon markets were the same. The transaction was 125,000 jiao in the early market and 40,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins still had no changes, at 430,000 wen. The transaction was more than 46,400 wen, with an estimated silver price of 10,800 taels. Silver Foreign Exchange was Complex and Simple. (Silver Funds) Yesterday, the bank's receipts and deposits were slightly more frequent than in the past, but the procedures were very simple. Chinese merchants received and deposited 2.56 million in banknotes, foreign merchants received and deposited more than 2.1 million in banknotes, various goods, exchange taxes, and other funds received and deposited 12.67 million. The deposit transaction was more than 1.5 million, the telegraphic transfer was 900,000, the warehouse entry was 1.4 million, the money house silver public bill receipts and deposits were more than 31 million, the head-up bill receipts and deposits were more than 5.2 million, various exchange bills were more than 600,000, and the cash payment was more than 1 million.

In the banknote market, 65,000 in the early market and 50,000 in the noon market, 180,000 outside the market in the early market and 150,000 in the noon market. The check transaction was 65,000 in the early market and 60,000 in the noon market, adding 25 to the market price. The bank's buying and selling was 650,000 in the early market and 800,000 in the noon market. The banknote entry and exit was 2.89 million.

The foreign market situation seemed to have a slight increase on the surface, but the content was still</p>
<p>stagnant, and it is still not possible to be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Big Bar Retracted 4375</h3>
<p>The National Society's London telegram on the 12th: The big bar silver retracted, closing at 18 and a half pence for the near term and 18 pence and 5625 for the long term, down 7/16 from the previous day. The British-American exchange rate opened at 3 yuan 4 jiao 8 fen 25.</p>
<h3>Complexities of Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>As a result, the British long, the American flat. Yesterday, the silver market saw an astonishing surge, but off-market trading and futures experienced the opposite trend, declining instead. Similarly, exchange rates saw the British flat and the American dropping. Even the Shanghai market trended differently, with HSBC's listed American dollar shrinking by 0.125, the French Franc decreasing slightly by four yuan, German exchange rates dropping by half a yuan, Japanese Yen decreasing slightly by 0.025, and all others remaining unchanged. It appears that the internal market initially saw the British pound flat before weakening in the morning, then returning to flat at noon. The American dollar was initially firm before weakening, then stabilizing. In the afternoon, both the British and American currencies showed signs of deficit. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British pound increased by 0.3125, the American dollar remained flat, and the gold price experienced turbulent fluctuations. Transactions by various banks were vigorous, with an estimated 200,000+ pounds in British currency. Gold firms slightly decreased, with Sassoon Bank selling off 100,000+ pounds, which were absorbed by Mackenzie &amp; Co. and Japanese firms. October traded at 19.5625. Mackenzie also traded American dollars, with September at 31.25 and October at 31.25 to 3.75. American dollar transactions exceeded 1,000,000, with most Chinese merchants buying to offset short positions, while some were selling. Recent sales from Mumbai have arrived. The day's transactions are detailed below.</p>
<p>The internal market for British exchange rates varied, with the asking price opening at 1 shilling 9 7/8 pence (1.1875 to 1.3125), and the bid price at 1.25 to 1.375.

The listed price was 1 yuan, equivalent to 3 taels, 2 mace, 7 fen, 8.69 liang.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<h3>Reorganization Bonds Continue to Rise by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Various September Series Opened, Transaction Volume Increased Slightly Yesterday (12th) At the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, although there were various bonds in the spot market, the transaction volume was still sparse, totaling only 18,000 yuan. Among them, the 20 Customs Bonds accounted for 10,000 yuan, and the rest only 1,000 to 2,000 yuan each. The futures market was dull, with no large-scale transactions from any party. However, the September series, which had no transactions recently, suddenly opened yesterday. The total transaction volume was 2,765,000 yuan, with reorganization and salt tax bonds accounting for 670,000 yuan each, and the others only around 200,000 yuan. Customs Consolidation Bonds and the Sixth Year Bonds each only had 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and the 1996 financial bonds still had no market. As for the price trends of the bonds, the stagnant situation was no different from before, and both sessions were in a state of revolving without major changes. However, the market seemed to be stable due to the central situation, so although the large accounts did not move, the sporadic demand was not deserted, and the price was slightly firmer than the previous day. Among them, the reorganization bonds alone rose by one yuan, and the others also increased by a few cents. However, as the September futures and spot markets had no market recently, the gains and losses were more uneven. Furthermore, observing the future of the bond market, it is still chaotic and difficult to predict.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Remains Prosperous</h3>
<p>(Report from American-Eastern Bank Company) On Thursday, the New York stock market opened with eager buyers, especially for railway and General Motors stocks. Sellers were numerous in the middle of the session, but buyers remained strong, and the two sides were evenly matched. The market was initially firm and then softened, but recovered well at the close. The total daily transaction volume was 4,400,000 shares. According to the opinion of Bias Company, the stock market has recently approached its peak, so it is advisable for bulls to reduce their scope and conserve their strength.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<h3>Yarn Market Fluctuates</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation is exceptionally chaotic, with market prices varying. However, the bullish sentiment is high because American cotton is rising, and the current inventories of various factories and groups are depleted, so the buying force is very strong. However, the bullish positions of a certain factory are gradually being closed, and general retail investors are also inclined to go long, so it rises and falls suddenly, lacking control.</p>
<p>Ren Biao is slightly popular. In the morning market for Ren Biao, American cotton rose again, and people's sentiments were very high, with each month rising by 78 cents to 1.2 taels. The second and third sessions tended to fall, and the closing price fell even further. As a result, each month rose or fell by 0.01, 0.02, or 0.05 yuan. In the afternoon, a large account covered short positions and turned long, with each month rising by 0.02, 0.04, 0.05, or 0.07 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 35,800 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 2,100 bales, Tonghe 850 bales, Tongxing 1,400 bales, Gengfeng 600 bales, and Yida 650 bales. Ruida bought 3,000 bales, Suilong 950 bales, Mingde 850 bales, Changyu 850 bales, and Changfeng 1,500 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>| Contract | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 111526 | Up 0.03 | 124150 |</p>

<p>| Total |  |  | 510250 |</p>
<p>Yarn sales are still good. Current yarn sales are still good. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 1,300 bales for the day. The market prices varied. The purchase amounts of each gang are listed below: Sichuan 210, inland 230, Changsha 280, same industry 215, Guangdong 235, Shantou 75, Zhenjiang 25. Total: 1,300 bales</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Chaotic</h3>
<p>The cotton market situation is still firm, but the market prices are chaotic and irregular, with up-and-down fluctuations. This is because although American cotton is rising, the silver price is increasing sharply, but the gold market has not fallen, so the buying sentiment is still strong, and most targets are bullish. However, large accounts that have made profits are taking the opportunity to sell and close positions, so the table is relaxed instead.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao's market state is still excellent. In the morning market for Zheng Biao, American cotton rose sharply, and the buying sentiment in the market was tight again, with each month rising by 0.03 yuan. The second session was flat, but a large number of large account bulls emerged, and the market price fell sharply at the third closing. As a result, each month fell by 0.005 to 0.02 yuan. In the afternoon, a certain large account turned long from short, and the market price rose again by 0.02, 0.03 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 131,300 dan. It was found that Tonghe sold 6,600 dan, Changfeng 7,200 dan, Yuanda 5,300 dan, Gengfeng 3,100 dan, and Dafeng 2,400 dan. Ruida bought 9,400 dan, Dafu 2,800 dan, Shenchang 3,600 dan, Changhe 4,600 dan, Yuande 3,100 dan, and Yichang 2,200 dan. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>| November | 33 |  | 15170700 |</p>
<p>The demand for Yuanyuan cotton is gradually increasing. The current demand for business is gradually increasing. It is estimated that there are 1560 bales of Yaohua cotton Yun. 34.00 Shaanxi cotton Yufeng received 500 pieces to send to the factory, 34.00 Shaanxi cotton Yufeng received 700 pieces to send to the factory. 34.25 Zhengzhou cotton Maojin received 100 pieces to send to the factory, 31.00 Huoji cotton Tongyi received 800 bales to send to the factory.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Firmly Rises by 35 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm due to buying by traders, good piece goods trading, and purchases of forward contracts by manufacturers. Futures rose by 31 to 33 points, and spot prices rose by 35 points. British cotton futures rose by 19 to 20 points, and spot prices rose by 26 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 20 points. Indian cotton was firm due to the rise in American cotton and short covering, with Flat Er rising by 7.75 Rupees, Aomura rising by 11.75 Rupees, and Bai Luo Creek rising by 12 Rupees.

<p>Grain River Down Rice Falls by 3-4 Cents</p>
<p>No. 230, West Road, Shanghai Nanfengji Wharf, very few people came to the market in the morning. The number of early and late rice traders from the same gang and Qingjiao Lian was less than 600 shi. The opening price fell by 3-4 cents, and Changxi Beigeng also followed by 1-2 cents. However, Dongxin arrived and sold flat, and the price remained at the original level. Yangdu</p>
<p>Sharp has no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>Although the source of rice in Xinzha yesterday's rice market was small, the stock was still abundant, and people's hearts were not uplifted. No one consulted about goods from Kunshan, Liyang, Yixing, etc. The overall market fell by 3 cents. There were small amounts of early and late rice from Changxi Beigeng and Nangang, but the out-of-town customers had no appetite at all, forming a discount of 2 cents. The new japonica rice was similar to the Nanshi market. Nearly a thousand shi of new out-of-town pointed rice also arrived, and the market price plummeted by half a yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Mornings Down, Afternoons Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation, the market opened very soft in the morning, and customers' interest was particularly dull. Only 700 bags of small ground rice were sold from the local hometown, and the market price was about to fall back by nearly 1 cent. It is estimated that the current Japanese have not had a large batch of shipments, and after the rain the day before yesterday, people's hearts everywhere were unanimously downward. The Nanjing gang originally had a large number of shipments, but stopped due to the rain, and other customers were more hesitant. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, a hometown customer suddenly arrived in Shanghai to inquire. The customer had not been to the market for a long time, and immediately bought 500 bags of small ground rice. The market price was nearly 1 cent higher according to the market, which caused other hometowns and local people to buy, and the market also changed its position. A total of 1,500 bags of small ground rice were sold throughout the day, priced at 9 yuan 5 cents, 5 cents 2 minutes, and up to 7 cents. Chen Xiaojiao was priced at 9 yuan 2 cents 7 minutes to 2 cents 2 minutes, and Saigon No. 1 was priced at 10 yuan 0 cents 1 cent and a half for 200 bags.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Falls and Then Turns Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed a trend of initially falling and then becoming popular in each month after the market opened in the morning. When the opening price was due to the reported price of foreign wheat being about 0.02 or 0.03 yuan, people outside the industry were inevitably tired and lonely. In addition, Fuxin and Fufeng, etc., were still smoothly releasing goods, so the lowest price was about 0.02 yuan lower than the previous day. However, since then, due to the Shandong and Nanyang gangs, purchases were made in each of the near and far terms, and the quantity was quite prosperous, so the weak situation was immediately turned to high and strong, and because the gold price was low and then high, and the exchange rate was also changing, the subsequent situation should be determined based on the true situation abroad. As a result, this month was 0.005 yuan lower than the previous day, and the months of September, October, and November were 0.005 yuan better, December was 0.0025 yuan, and January was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the market opened in the morning, the various months generally showed a stable revolving trend. Although the reported price of foreign wheat was 0.02 or 0.03 yuan, the gold price was low and then raised, as if there was no entry or exit. It is widely rumored that manufacturers continue to order foreign wheat, which is still ambiguous, but the manufacturers basically have to order it. As for the domestic situation, it is ultimately felt that it cannot be cheaper anymore, so although people's hearts are calm, the selling of domestic goods cannot be smoothly changed. As a result, August was 0.03 yuan lower than the previous day, September and December were 0.02 yuan lower, October was 0.01 yuan lower, and the rest were unchanged. The current wheat market is still stable, and both arrivals and sales have not been very smooth. About 200 bags of Penglai wheat arrived, priced at 3 taels 3 mace 5 fen yun.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Foreign Firms' Silk Market Strengthens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, European and American firms were throwing out purchases and hoarding new factory silk from the upper and middle classes, but overseas actual sales have gradually calmed down. The raw materials in the hands of each manufacturer are limited, and they are unwilling to sell at low prices, and the market is becoming more popular. Yesterday, only Lan Lebi supplemented 60 bags of grade B 13-22 strip of 83.4 uniform white factory silk, priced at 556 taels.</p>
<h3>Wan White Silk Transport to Shanghai Turns Smooth</h3>
<p>The spring cocoon production in southern and northern Anhui this year is not abundant. Since the new silk was put on the market, due to the sluggish silk sales in Europe and America, the transport of new silk to Shanghai has been sparse. In order to launch overseas silk sales, the silk in the producing area is being transported to Shanghai one after another. In the past few days, 140 pieces of new Wan white silk (i.e., reversed silk) have been transported and stored in Shanghai for sale.</p>
<h3>Wubei Zhenmei Already Has Motivation</h3>
<p>The Zhenmei tea in the northern part of Wuyuan has always been known for its excellent legal system, so its value is also more expensive than other goods. Over the years, the world economy has been declining, and the French gold has been tight, severely impacting the sales of high-end tea. After the road tea arrived in Shanghai this year, it did not open for more than two months due to the excessive price difference. Recently, the inventories of various teas in Tunxi and Suian have been exhausted, and the tea price has also been higher than before. Moreover, the stock in Annam has gradually been cleared, so the Zhenmei tea in Wubei has a trend of taking advantage of the time. Yesterday, Fushi Foreign Firm bought the first batch of goods, with a price of 128 taels. Other foreign firms such as Yongxing, Tongfu, and Baochang have also sent out a large number of telegrams for the Zhenmei tea on this road, and there will be a large transaction next week. The market for other items such as Luzhuang Tuzhuang Zhenmei Zhenmei needle tea and pearl tea have all been raised by four or five taels to ten taels.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Disk Trading Is Quiet Yesterday's sugar market association market disk, trading is quiet, and people feel more sluggish. The transaction price of 24 coarse sand white goods of Dutch sugar was 14 taels and 6 cents, and ordinary goods were rarely asked. The raw sand red of the 14th was 12 taels and 7 cents, and the red of the 9th Dutch was 10 taels and 07 cents. The market was firmer, with Taikoo sugar B mark at 16 taels and 3 cents, CW mark at 15 taels and 7 cents and a half, HX mark at 15 taels and 2 cents, and DY mark at 15 taels and 5 cents. Both entries and exits were sporadic, and the market was still stable. The number plate was also quiet, and Qin Yuan Bingyuan's number owner was still willing to sell, but the Wufu brand was tightened and not sold, with a great increase in the price. But the shipment was very dull, and there was no receiver at all, and the market was very flat and not strange.</p>
<p>Coal Anthracite Coal Popular, Block Coal Tired Yesterday, the market transaction of coal jin was still not bad, and the Hangzhou gang bought a lot of white coal. The selling price has not increased or decreased much. Benbuji's silk mills bought a large amount of Yanmei Jiawangtong, and the selling price was firm and popular. Yesterday, the market price per ton was directly quoted at 7 taels and 5 cents. However, the sales of screened block coal were not moving, so the selling price was also tired. Yesterday, the selling price per ton was only 8 taels yun.</p>

<h3>The Ding Ding</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Lin Dīngdīng (琳丁丁) is a famous canine star in the American film industry. Every time he performs his wonderful skills, the audience is amazed by it. Therefore, the American news reported the death of the famous dog in an article covering half a page. The magic of the dog star to overwhelm the crowd can be seen from this. I once heard from the beautiful preacher, Miss Song, that she had not returned to China for many years. When she returned to China last year, she was deeply saddened by what she saw. Not only was the level of various aspects of life getting higher and higher, but the extravagant and licentious atmosphere was also greatly different from the past. I don't want to go back to China in the future, etc. Although this is the words of a preacher, her mind is still more peaceful and quiet after all, and the point of observation is naturally different. However, in recent years, the extravagant and licentious atmosphere in the United States has become more and more serious, and the number of unemployed and bored people has been increasing. This is an undeniable fact. However, the current economic problem is an unprecedented terror trend in the world. No country is not suffering, and the general ambitious imperialists want to take advantage of the turbulent waves of instability and expand their colonial power at all costs. No matter what country the people are in, they should no longer waste their time in feasting and dancing, but should shift their eyes and brains to the general trend of the world and the important plans of the country. Although the canine star is bright, it should no longer be promoted and praised in a flamboyant manner. These words of mine are absolutely inappropriate to say to Americans, because I am Chinese. The so-called (adopting a daughter-in-law to be a matchmaker, not even taking care of oneself), I have no qualifications to criticize at all. Although Americans are extravagant and licentious, their scientific and military preparations are still gradually being invented and progressing day by day, while what our country has obtained is nothing more than imitating the superficial aspects of Europe and the United States, and the attitude of arrogance, extravagance, and lewdness. What else is there? Although the customs of arrogance, extravagance, and lewdness in our country are not entirely spread from the United States, at least a part of them are also infected. For example, the film companies in Hollywood are so grand in scale, and the famous films they produce are popular all over the world, so the amount of money they absorb from the world every year can be imagined. Therefore, although the United States promotes extravagance on the one hand, it is still a way to absorb the world's economy on the other hand. Therefore, the canine star has achieved amazing feats in the film industry, and its mourning is also appropriate. Take a look at the dogs in China. Not a few days ago, a shocking act was also discovered: Japanese people having intercourse with dogs. Both are dogs, but one is like that, and the other is like this. Is it the fault of man, or the fault of the dog?</p>

<p>The scorching sun is still rampant during the day, and I feel a slight coolness on my pillow and mat in the middle of the night.

<h3>Manufacturing and Assembly of Enamel Utensils</h3>
<p>— Zhang Lingzhou</p>
<p>Recently, I read Mr. Shen Min's article (A Brief Discussion on Enamel Products), which is slightly inconsistent with the facts. I am in the manufacturing aspect of the enamel factory all day long, and I would like to describe what I have heard and seen on weekdays to the readers. The method and procedure of manufacturing enamel utensils are described separately below.</p>
<p>A. Regarding the base (1) Raw base: Use steel sheets purchased from the market (commonly known as black iron sheets) to form various colors and shapes by artificial or mechanical force, which is called the raw base. (2) Put the formed raw base into dilute sulfuric acid to remove impurities on the steel sheet that are enough to prevent it from combining with the enamel. However, at this time, attention should be paid to the sulfide on the steel sheet, because the steel sheet is immersed in sulfuric acid. Easy to produce sulfuric acid. This compound is more than enough to destroy the enamel utensils.</p>
<p>B. Composition and Enamelling of Enamel Powder Enamel powder is composed of various minerals and oxidizing raw materials according to the composition. Its nature is mostly alkaline. When the raw materials are combined and mixed, they are placed in a high-heat furnace to liquefy them, and then they are stirred in water to form a crystalline shape. Then put this crystalline shape into a mill, mix it with water, and grind it into a slurry, and then it can be used for enamelling. (1) Ground color: the enamel powder that is enamelled for the first time on the base that has been immersed in dilute sulfuric acid. There is a ground color under any color enamel powder as a medium, because it has a combination that is closely combined with the steel sheet. At the same time, the ground color is the most difficult problem for enamel operators to solve, because after the steel sheet and the ground color are baked at a high temperature, each has its own physical expansibility, and it must be equivalent, otherwise there will be a risk of explosion. Its composition is as follows: 0.5Na2O 0.5B2O3 0.2K2O 0.15AL2O3 2.0S.O2 0.3CaO 0.1F2</p>
<p>(2) Covering Enamel is the enamel powder that is shone on the ground color. Usually, it must be done twice, otherwise the color will not be fresh. Its temperature and expansibility are equivalent to the ground color. The composition of white</p>
<p>color cover powder is as follows: 0.45Na2O 0.15 B2O3 0.15K2O 0.55AL2O3 0.ooSiO2 0.4omgO 0.3oSNO2 Common people often say that enamel powder contains lead, which is not suitable for hygiene. However, in the following equation, although there is lead, not only is it harmless to hygiene, but also there is no toxicity at all.</p>
<h3>Jian 1932</h3>
<p>0.ioNa2O 2.5oSiO2 0.i5K2O 0.i5AL2O4 0.75PbO 04oB2O3 Add oxide colors to white cover powder, such as iron oxide (Ee2O3) for red, uranium oxide (UO3) for yellow and black, cobalt oxide (Co2O3) for blue, a mixture of gold and tin or kaolin for rose, copper oxide (CuO) for green or blue, and so on. (3) Decoration: The fired utensils are printed by hand, transfer printing, air pressure and other methods with enamel powders of various colors according to the mold to form various patterns sold on the market.

<h3>A Humble Opinion on Improving the Eating Problem</h3>
<p>— Zhen Zheng</p>
<p>Recently, opinions on improving the eating problem have been frequently published in this newspaper. However, the discussions often focus on the details of communal eating and separate eating systems, exhaustively researching them. The many other advantages and disadvantages that need to be improved have not been discussed. Humans are omnivorous animals and should not only eat one type of grain. Although we have many kinds of dishes to accompany our meals, in reality, grains are the foundation. The other dishes are just to enhance the taste to encourage the consumption of grains, like sucking on sugar after taking medicine. Regardless of the inadequacy of the nutrients obtained, southerners who eat rice often get sick because of it. The silver skin acid (i.e., vitamin) in rice is lost entirely through grinding, hulling, and washing. Moreover, the protein content in rice, which is indispensable for human nutrition, only accounts for 6%. The protein content in wheat flour is 17%, exceeding it by more than double. There are many reasons for the weakness of the Chinese people, but a lack of attention to diet and nutrition is a major cause. Looking at countries that eat rice compared to countries that eat wheat, the people of the former are weaker than those of the latter, which is clear evidence. Therefore, in my opinion, improving the eating problem must start with eating more wheat and a more varied diet. This will not only benefit nutrition and the economy but also adjust and enrich the rural economy and national finance. Wheat-growing areas are almost all over the country, but southerners do not like to eat wheat, so its value is very low. Based on the principle that cheap grain hurts farmers and expensive grain harms the people, both farmers and people in our country suffer harm and lose their balance. Regarding health preservation, communal eating should be abolished as soon as possible in light of modern bacteriology. There is no doubt about that. However, separate eating systems, such as assigning food like at Western banquets, seem to have shortcomings in terms of procedure, economy, and individual appetite. In fact, Westerners also feel the inconvenience of assigned food. In ordinary meals, they have already discarded this method and adopted the method of preparing clean empty bowls, spoons, and forks for each person, three to five items each. All the dishes and soups are placed in separate containers in the middle of the table. Each person first takes a bowl and fork, forks several pieces of bread according to their appetite, then uses a bowl to take soup, and after finishing, uses another bowl to take vegetables. After finishing, they change to another bowl to take other dishes. In short, each time a dish is taken, the bowl is changed. This not only avoids the direct and indirect transmission of germs but also feels convenient in terms of procedure, appetite, and economy. This method is easy for us to imitate and may as well be imitated. As for the assigned food method, not only do we dislike its trouble, but Westerners also dislike its trouble. It is only carried out due to etiquette. If we imitate it, we would be imitating others' weaknesses and abandoning our own strengths.</p>

<p>The other day I was talking with a friend at S school and we talked about their summer school. He said, "Business is not booming this year. The principal is shaking his head over there!" As for why it's not booming, the reasons are: first, "economic recession after the war, customers (tutoring students) are decreasing"; second, "more competitors, supply exceeds demand." Because summer school is for tutoring, there is no need to get a business license (registration), and the bosses and partners of various schools want to take this opportunity to make extra money, so summer schools sprung up like mushrooms after rain all over the city. But the number of customers is limited, so business is slow.</p>
<p>Third, "the bosses only know how to (copy), (imitate), (grab business), and don't know how to improve the goods."</p>
<p>Party doctrine teachers teach mathematics, and English teachers teach chemistry. Of course, their knowledge of the goods is probably not very good. Fourth, "the partners don't know how to do business (that is, they don't know how to cater to the psychology of the guests)." Customers naturally want to save their expenses as much as possible. It's best not to buy books, and handouts can be obtained without spending a penny. But if you encounter some partners who don't know how to do business, are unhappy, or can't compile handouts, then customers have to spend money to buy books. The funniest thing is that one partner will choose a book that costs eight yuan. When customers hear that, they have to run away at the news.</p>
<p>Fortunately, S school still has the third (seven) in the "3-7 principle" to support the first two (sevens), but it is much worse than in previous years.</p>
<p>Chatting and Talking</p>
<h3>In the Restaurant</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Mr. Li is hosting a banquet today for the one-month celebration of his second child. Needless to say, this restaurant is so spacious, and the walls are covered with glass frames of "ways to make money" and "profit reaches all rivers." Everything looks magnificent, at least very fitting for Mr. Li's guests.</p>
<p>Five or six dishes have already been served. Mr. Li diligently toasted everyone for a while and then went to other tables. Of course, as soon as the host left, some guests felt they could relax a little, so after a round of "five quai" and "eight horses," the Jingzhuang Shaoxing wine went down a whole pot, and everyone felt hot in the face, full of energy, and started to talk and laugh happily. At first, the owner of the soy sauce shop was complaining about how "business is really not easy; there are three clerks and two apprentices in the shop, and the wages alone are 28 yuan per month, plus the 2.25 yuan for the two apprentices, and then there's food, electricity, and police donations; but the daily business is only about 200 yuan, and after calculation, there's only a little over 100 yuan to earn each month, which for..." The implication was that it was not easy to maintain his opium addiction, but everyone then started talking about national affairs, so they didn't pay much attention to the soy sauce shop owner's subsequent words.</p>
<p>"The market is full of imported salted fish, which shows that XX goods have been imported in large quantities." This was said by a young man wearing a small homespun jacket and pants. A bald, fat man sighed and said:</p>
<p>"No matter what group or organization is powerful, it's always redundant; for example, that person named Yun, for the sake of other people's affairs, why did he have to go to jail himself?" "No wonder," this was the voice opposite the bald man: "Zhang Xueliang never resisted, how can that not make young people angry?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Wang Jingwei has resigned again, so Chinese affairs will never be done well." This was again the voice of the bald man.</p>
<p>"Everyone doesn't value loyalty, there's really no way. If China could all be like Guan Yu:" Another elderly man with a three-section beard pointed to the image of Guan Sheng Emperor on the wall and said: "Then there would be reason. Now it's all messed up, precisely because there's no second Guan Ye born in China."</p>
<p>"That's right," another voice said: "If I were still young, I would definitely not do business, and I would deposit a little capital in a foreign bank and then join the Northeast Volunteer Army!"</p>
<p>The tobacconist Mr. Lu's words were, of course, considered "honest words" by himself, but he didn't expect that they would make the young man in homespun laugh out loud.</p>
<p>The dishes continued to be served, now a large pot of clear stewed duck, topped with red silk and mushrooms, a hot aroma pierced into everyone's nostrils, and then the chaotic sound of chopsticks mingled with the uncoordinated sound of chewing replaced the lofty talk.</p>
