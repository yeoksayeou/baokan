<p>自從上月二十八晚禍變爆發以來。上海正向着極端危險與恐怖的前途推進着。此數日中槍彈悲鳴。血肉横飛。飛機鄉的擊大火的焚燒。東亞第一大市塲的上海。以及居住於上海的三百萬無辜的人民。已整個困陷於破壞與恐怖襲擊的悲境了。</p>
<p>不可避免的禍殃。今旣已毫不遲疑地展開於我們之面前。吾人則惟有毅然肩承以英勇的精神。起而奮鬥。暴日旣已置我們於死地。從死境中求得生路。端在於我們自身艱苦之爭鬥。故目前我們無所用其驚惶。尤無所用其恐怖。要當以沉毅的精神。鎭靜的態度。一致的步伍。有計劃有組織的行動。奮起和强敵搏戰。</p>
<p>第一。我們認爲商界應即日開市。以安定人心。因爲罷市三天。已足以表示我們一致抗日悲壯激越的情緒。但假如長此罷衣。却很足以搖動人心。增加後方的恐怖。並減低一般人奮鬥的力量。正爲日人所期望欣愉。爲安定後方秩序計。所以必須即日開市。照常營業。</p>
<p>第二。我們認爲銀行亦應即日開市。以安定金融在此目前人心惶惶之際。銀行開市。如恐發生危險。則應請租界當局負責防維。如恐提欵者過多。發生動搖。則銀行界儘可妥自籌。謀嚴加限制。且聞銀行界本已準備充足。自可無慮。同時社會對此種擾亂金融。間接帮助敵人的行動。也可予以正義之制裁。不必多所顧慮。銀行業一日不開市。社會金融。即一日不得穩定。而其影響所及。全國各地。亦必引起恐慌。因此銀行業必須早日開市。</p>
<p>第三。我們認爲一切力量。必須集中。必須在有計劃有組織之行動下。分途進行。如慰勞前敵將士。如救濟戰地同胞等工作。都應於協助地方政府與租界當局之。外更由各公法團體產生一最高權力機關。通盤籌劃。集中力量。共同進行慰勞物品。必適合於前敵將士之需要。救濟災民。不必收容一處。亦可籌妥善之方法。送往外埠。其他如調劑糧食。救濟失業。維持交通。安定秩序。都應協力共籌。力聚則收效大。散則收效微。此點我們必須認淸。</p>
<p>總之。此次日人用心在於造成上海的大恐怖。我們必須以鎭靜的態度。有計劃有組織的行動。維持社會秩序。消弭此種恐怖。使敵志無由得逞。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Methods to Cope with the Serious Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the calamity broke out on the night of the 28th of last month, Shanghai has been advancing towards an extremely dangerous and terrifying future. In these past few days, gunfire has wailed, flesh and blood have flown, and airplanes have bombed and fires have raged. Shanghai, the largest city in East Asia, and the three million innocent people residing in it, are now entirely trapped in the tragic state of destruction and terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Since the inevitable disaster has now unfolded before us without hesitation, we can only resolutely shoulder it with heroic spirit and rise up to fight. Since the brutal Japanese have placed us in a dead end, finding a way to survive from this dead end lies in our own arduous struggle. Therefore, we should not be alarmed or terrified at the moment. We must, with a steadfast spirit, a calm attitude, unified steps, and planned and organized actions, rise up and fight the powerful enemy.</p>
<p>First, we believe that the business community should reopen immediately to stabilize people's hearts. Because a three-day strike is enough to express our unified, anti-Japanese, tragic, and intense emotions. However, if the strike continues for a long time, it will be enough to shake people's hearts, increase the terror in the rear, and reduce the strength of the general public's struggle, which is exactly what the Japanese are expecting and rejoicing in. For the sake of stabilizing order in the rear, it is necessary to reopen immediately and conduct business as usual.</p>
<p>Second, we believe that banks should also reopen immediately to stabilize finances. At this moment of widespread panic, if banks open but fear danger, they should request the concession authorities to be responsible for defense and maintenance. If there are fears that too many people will withdraw funds, causing turmoil, the banking industry can make its own arrangements to impose strict restrictions. Moreover, it is said that the banking industry is already well-prepared, so there is no need to worry. At the same time, society can impose righteous sanctions on this kind of action that disrupts finances and indirectly helps the enemy, without much concern. One day that the banking industry does not open, the social finance will not be stable for one day. And its impact will cause panic throughout the country. Therefore, the banking industry must open as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Third, we believe that all forces must be concentrated and carried out in various ways under planned and organized actions, such as comforting the soldiers at the front and providing relief to compatriots in the war zone. In addition to assisting local governments and concession authorities, a supreme authority should be established by various public organizations to comprehensively plan, concentrate forces, and jointly carry out relief activities. Comfort items must be suitable for the needs of soldiers at the front. Relief to disaster victims does not have to be confined to one place, and sound methods can be devised to send them to other ports. Other matters, such as adjusting food supplies, providing relief to the unemployed, maintaining transportation, and stabilizing order, should be jointly planned. Concentrating forces will yield greater results, while dispersing them will yield minimal results. We must clearly recognize this point.</p>
<p>In short, the Japanese are trying to create great terror in Shanghai. We must maintain social order and eliminate this terror with a calm attitude and planned and organized actions, so that the enemy's ambition cannot succeed.</p>

<p>Thomas States Mediation Opinions</p>
<p>Japanese Representative Welcomes the Establishment of a Neutral Zone</p>
<p>Britain, the United States, France, and Italy Take a Unified Approach</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council met at 2:30 PM today to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute. Because Peng Gu returned to Paris, French Army Minister Teideux chaired the meeting. It is said that this meeting was held at the request of Britain. At the meeting, the Chinese delegation had not yet received any news of the Nanjing incident last night. They believed that this must be due to the interruption of telegram communication in Nanjing. Teideux began by saying that the meeting was convened at the request of the British government, so he invited British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Thomas to express his opinion. Thomas then stated that the British government believed that the current situation in the Far East could not be allowed to continue. Every day, news of major new disputes and wars in vast areas continues to arrive. Shanghai has become the center of continuous battles, with rifles, machine guns, airplanes, and artillery participating at the same time. This kind of real war is continuing, and the League of Nations cannot sit idly by. If it is allowed to continue, the League of Nations, the Paris Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty will inevitably lose the world's trust. The US government should take exactly the same view of the overall situation. This relationship is not trivial. In mid-April, the League of Nations Administrative Council's efforts for peace were fortunately supported and assisted by the United States with full sincerity, and several times, the Administrative Council urged its members to send diplomatic notes to China and Japan as a supplement to its efforts. The British and other member governments have stated their willingness to respond to the Administrative Council's appeal. Unfortunately, this effort did not succeed, so the British government, in cooperation with the United States, decided to persevere to end this deplorable situation. It is believed that other governments will also take the same action. Britain and the United States have already lodged formal protests with the governments of China and Japan, demanding: 1. End all violent actions and war preparations; 2. Both sides should withdraw their troops in the Shanghai area to a neutral area agreed upon to protect the public concession; 3. Negotiations should begin immediately in the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the December 9th Administrative Council resolution to resolve all existing disputes. Thomas then read the speech made by Foreign Secretary Sir Simon in the House of Commons this afternoon: "Unfortunately, I must report that on the night of January 29, a very serious battle occurred between Chinese and Japanese troops in Shanghai. The government is very concerned about this incident, both for the sake of general peace and because it is close to the public concession and will endanger the lives and property of British citizens. We are now repeatedly urging the Chinese and Japanese governments and the commanders of both sides to accept the plan agreed upon by the British and American consuls-general in Shanghai to establish a neutral area between the Chinese and Japanese armies. The area will be occupied by the troops of the great powers and the troops of the public concession. Instructions have been sent to the British army to cooperate if the area can be demarcated. Thanks to the efforts of the consul-general, a ceasefire was agreed upon on January 29. However, according to recent news reports, the war has clearly resumed, which is regrettable. The government has urged the Chinese and Japanese governments to bear the heavy responsibility of remedying the current situation. As for the position of the British army and navy, in addition to the three battalions of infantry originally stationed in Shanghai, the government decided on Sunday to send a warship from Hong Kong carrying a battalion of infantry and a company of artillery as reinforcements. The British forces stationed in Shanghai include the cruiser Cornwall, the destroyer Thrasher, and two other gunboats. The cruiser Kent will be added in the next few days, and the Suffolk has already arrived on Sunday. The government has been consulting closely with other relevant powers. This policy is intended to be actively maintained. The British consul-general in Shanghai is now working closely with representatives of other powers. Last night at 11 o'clock, Japanese warships opened fire on Nanjing. According to the latest news, everything has been calmed down. British citizens are all safe." After Thomas finished reading, Japanese representative Sato said that he was very interested in hearing the British government's statement, because the Japanese government had long asked Britain and the United States to discuss the plan for dealing with the Shanghai situation. Sato then announced Japan's document to the League of Nations regarding the Shanghai incident, and stated that Japan was willing to cooperate with the great powers. The suggestion of a neutral zone was originally proposed by Japan, so the Japanese government welcomes it very much. However, there is one point in the British representative's speech that needs to be corrected: Last night, Japanese warships fired three shots in Nanjing after Japanese soldiers were attacked. The Chinese provocation was not mentioned by the British representative. The German representative stated that Germany wishes to see peace in the Far East more eagerly than any other country. Teideux said that the French government has already instructed to send a note to the Chinese and Japanese governments, and the French reinforcements to Shanghai have already departed. Italian representative Grandi also made the same statement. Then, Chinese chief representative Dr. Yen stated that China deeply appreciates the important statements made by the representatives of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany. Then Teideux stated that the purpose of this meeting is to combine the legal rights of the Administrative Council with the steps taken by the great powers, which has already been achieved. The meeting then adjourned (Reuters, 2nd).</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the Japanese warships bombarded Nanjing, it made the League of Nations feel more difficult to handle the Far East dispute. The council has already scheduled a special meeting to be held at 2:30 PM today to deal with this new situation. There are also several parties now seeking to convene a special meeting of all members of the League of Nations. Because it is the opening of the disarmament conference, representatives of various countries are all here, and the meeting is easy to convene. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) From the morning of the 2nd to 3:00 PM, the Japanese warships on the river in Shimonoseki took no action. Our army is still actively deploying defenses. Various military agencies are also on high alert. Electric nets and sandbags have been set up along the riverbank and at important street entrances in various commercial ports. Xingzhongmen is half-open and half-closed. Merchants are moving their belongings and taking their wives and children into the city to avoid danger. The roads are jammed. River ferries are operating as usual. Trains on the Nanjing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou lines are still running in the morning, and passengers are extremely crowded. (Special Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reports, several Japanese planes left Shanghai for Nanjing early in the morning on the 2nd for a night raid. The Japanese warships fired cannons at the Osaka Wharf in Shimonoseki, and Japanese soldiers suddenly used machine guns and rifles to shoot at our patrolling soldiers at the train station, followed by artillery. The first artillery shell landed near Lion Mountain. Our army and navy remained calm and ignored it. It only stopped after British and American consuls negotiated with the Japanese consul. (Special Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A Japanese merchant ship that arrived from Shanghai on the 1st was fully loaded with Japanese soldiers and anchored on the river in Shimonoseki. At 11:00 PM, a small part of our troops stationed in Pukou were transferred across the river into the city. The Japanese warships then fired warning shots to the west, a total of eleven shots, one of which was a live round, which was fired at the Lion Mountain Fort, but it did not explode. When the Japanese warships opened fire, all the lights in the city went out. At 1:40 AM on the morning of the 2nd, the lights were restored. Public security was as normal, and people were at ease. Currently, three Japanese warships have sailed east. Only three Japanese warships are anchored in the river in Shimonoseki, all flying alert flags. Our seven warships, as well as British and American warships, are also flying alert flags. Our army has strengthened security along the river and in the Shimonoseki area. Security is very tight, and there will be no problems with public order. It is heard that our army has adopted the principle of "We will not attack unless attacked." If Japanese warships or marines engage in tyrannical behavior, our army will resolutely resist in self-defense. (Central News Agency Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The military authorities here stated that they did not instruct the commander of the Lion Mountain Fort not to return fire regarding the Japanese gunboats' bombardment of Nanjing on the night of the 1st. What the newspapers reported is not true. The shells fired by the Japanese warships were not live rounds, so they did not return fire to avoid falling into their trap of provocation. Moreover, other countries also had warships docked on the river, and the commander of the fort should be cautious to avoid disturbing friendly warships. (National News Agency Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese consul-general told the foreign envoys that the Japanese army would never bombard Nanjing. However, just after midnight, the silent air of Nanjing was broken by the firing of a Japanese warship anchored in the river. According to Chinese eyewitnesses, the panic in Nanjing began at 11:15 PM. At that time, the Japanese marines protecting the Osaka Merchant Shipping Company's wharf began to bombard Chinese soldiers on the riverbank. Soon after, the Japanese warships opened fire, and shells fell in Shimonoseki and the city. Until 1:00 AM, the Japanese warships initially bombarded the Lion Mountain Fort, which was hit by several shells. However, officials announced that the fort did not return fire. Chinese soldiers in the city and along the river were instructed not to return fire. The Japanese warships fired about 20 shells in total. Several shells fell in the city, and two shells fell in the Shimonoseki area. Neither of the two shells in Shimonoseki exploded, but one policeman was killed in the city and there was a lot of damage. After the Japanese warships opened fire, the city was in chaos, and all the lights were turned off. Searchlights scanned the sky looking for Japanese aircraft, and anti-aircraft guns were also prepared to fire, but Japanese aircraft did not take off. Residents of Shimonoseki, hearing the sound of the shelling, jumped out of bed and rushed to the city to take refuge. By dawn, Shimonoseki had become almost a ghost town. After the shelling began, foreign consuls immediately took action to gather their citizens at a certain point in order to transport them out of the country. Cars and rickshaws were driving in the dark because the police were not allowed to turn on the lights, and collisions were inevitable. This morning, the streets leading to the outside of the city were filled with refugees. They were riding in cars, on animals, and on foot. They were all trying to flee Nanjing and find a safe place. The scene was heartbreaking. On the road to Hangzhou, there was an endless stream of people traveling by car, riding animals, and walking, all wanting to flee Nanjing and find a safe place. The scene was extremely distressing. This morning at dawn, Japanese warships sent marines ashore along the river in Shimonoseki. Chinese soldiers were directly opposite them. Although no conflict has occurred yet, a battle is inevitable. According to British consulate officials, all the consuls are very anxious about the situation, but they have not yet ordered their citizens to leave the country. After the Japanese authorities bombarded Nanjing last night, they landed this morning and protested to the Chinese authorities, saying that the Chinese soldiers had attacked the Japanese marines first. According to reliable sources, the Japanese protest seemed to imply that the Japanese warships would continue to take action. This statement is clearly true, because at 10:45 AM this morning, 100 Japanese sailors landed to protect the Osaka Merchant Shipping Company's wharf. Chinese soldiers have retreated a little from the riverbank to avoid conflict. The area between them has become a no-man's land. Six Japanese warships sailed upstream this morning. Around 10:00 AM, one of them sailed back. Currently, five are anchored in the river about a mile from Shimonoseki, and two are anchored outside Shimonoseki. According to official sources, last night the Japanese warships fired shells, one hitting the Lion Mountain Fort and several hitting the Mufu Mountain Fort. Of the more than 20 shells fired, the whereabouts of only about ten were known. It seems that there were several blanks among them. Many windows in Shimonoseki were shattered. Due to last night's incident, all banks are closed today. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It has now been confirmed that the Japanese warships' bombardment last night was purely a misunderstanding. According to Japanese officials, several Japanese sailors landed last night to buy personal items. A Chinese patrol team asked for a password in the dark, but they did not answer. Suspecting them of being bandits, they fired several shots into the air. The Japanese sailors immediately fled back to the ship and reported to their superiors that Chinese soldiers had attacked them. Therefore, the warships fired several shots, including several blanks, to see if the fort would respond. Seeing that the fort did not move, they stopped the bombardment. Now that the misunderstanding has been clarified, there will be no further incidents in Nanjing. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The police chief of Shimonoseki boarded a Japanese warship at noon today to discuss with the Japanese naval commander. A Reuters representative went to Shimonoseki after noon today and saw that the riverbank was quiet. A small team of Japanese sailors was still stationed at the Osaka Wharf. Chinese soldiers had occupied various positions near the city gate, about 800 yards away from the Japanese soldiers. The area between them had become a no-man's land. (Reuters News Agency Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At noon today, people's hearts gradually calmed down. The police headquarters sent people in cars to post notices on the streets, saying that Shimonoseki had returned to order and was as quiet as usual. The Nanjing Electric Plant announced this afternoon that at 11:30 last night, a shell from a Chinese-Japanese warship at the Shimonoseki Electric Plant passed through the wall of the second floor, creating a large hole about three feet in diameter. The shell did not explode, and there were no deaths or injuries. When the bombardment began, all the lights were turned off. This morning at 1:30, after the shelling stopped, Mayor Gu ordered the lights to be turned on again. The Nanjing telephone is suddenly not working. It is heard that the headquarters ordered the telephone bureau to be temporarily used exclusively for government and military authorities. (Reuters News Agency Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The situation in Nanjing has become serious again. Chinese soldiers are now preparing to defend against a Japanese attack. The military is now requisitioning trucks and other vehicles for transportation. All employees of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs left the city at 3:00 PM today. The British and American consuls have not yet ordered their citizens to leave the country. Only one American destroyer is docked here. Today, the American consul sent a radio telegram to the American naval commander requesting an additional destroyer. He then received a reply that one was sufficient. All teahouses and restaurants here have closed. There is a large shortage of one-yuan paper money and coins. Stores are reluctant to accept five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes when people use them to buy things, causing great inconvenience to residents. (Reuters News Agency Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Associated Press news: Japanese marines did not invade Nanjing yesterday. The Japanese marines who landed were only a small part of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha wharf. The Japanese army first fired rifles at the shore, followed by machine guns, and then artillery. The target was Lion Mountain. The Chinese side did not return fire with artillery. American citizens are all safe, but the American consul-general intends to order citizens to leave the country. (National News Agency Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Japanese warships opened fire last night, people here are in a panic today, causing much disturbance. This morning, the sound of rifles was heard again along the river in Shimonoseki. Because it is under martial law, it has not yet been possible to find out who fired them. However, the Chinese and Japanese authorities have assured the British and American consuls that they will not take any actions that could lead to war. The bombardment lasted about 15 minutes last night. The reason for it is still unclear. One theory is that it was a show of force to prevent Chinese troops from crossing the river to Shimonoseki. Another theory is that the Japanese guns were fired upstream on the Yangtze River. (National News Agency Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>After the Capital Was Bombarded</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Japanese Side Instead Lodges a Protest <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Falsely Accusing Our Army of Attacking First</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Refuted the Accusation Based on Reason</p>
<p>And Lodged a Serious Protest</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After receiving the Japanese protest, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately refuted it, stating that in the abridged version of February 2, it was claimed that the Japanese Navy in Shimonoseki, Nanjing, was suddenly attacked by the Chinese regular army at 11:00 PM on the 1st of this month, and was also bombarded by three shells from the Lion Mountain Fort. The Japanese Navy had no choice but to retaliate. Soon after, the Chinese side fell silent, and the Japanese Navy immediately stopped retaliating to minimize the damage caused by the attack. This time, the Japanese warships in Shimonoseki, disregarding the resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council and the Nine-Power Treaty and the Non-Aggression Pact, fired cannons without reason, hitting Lion Mountain, Shimonoseki Station, Qingliang Mountain, Mufu Mountain, and Beijige, etc., and fired machine guns and rifles. It was a deliberate provocation. The claim that they were attacked by the Chinese regular army and the Lion Mountain Fort is not true. The Chinese government, in accordance with international conventions and the resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council not to expand the situation, has not deployed regular troops outside the city of Nanjing, and has strictly ordered the Lion Mountain Fort not to open fire without orders. Therefore, the claim that they were first attacked by the Chinese regular army is completely untrue. According to the report from the Lion Mountain Fort, when the Japanese warships opened fire, this fort did not return fire because it had not been ordered to do so. The claim that the fort fired first is not the truth. In addition to lodging a serious protest against the illegal actions of the Japanese warships in Shimonoseki and demanding that they be quickly ordered not to cause further incidents, the corresponding reply is hereby given for your reference. (Special Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reports from the Garrison Commander and the Chief of the Police Department, the Japanese warships anchored in Shimonoseki, Nanjing, suddenly fired eight cannons one after another after 11:00 PM on the 1st of this month, and used searchlights to target Lion Mountain, Shimonoseki Station, Beijige, Qingliang Mountain, and Mufu Mountain, etc., and fired machine guns and rifles at the same time, which did not stop until after 12:00 AM. The Chinese side did not retaliate to avoid conflict. When the Japanese marines attacked the Chinese army in Shanghai, disregarding the resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council and the Nine-Power Treaty and the Non-Aggression Pact, the Chinese people were angry. However, the Japanese warships fired guns and cannons in Shimonoseki for no reason, which was a deliberate expansion of the situation. The Japanese side should bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this provocative act. A serious protest is hereby lodged with the Japanese Embassy in China, requesting that the Japanese warships and others be ordered not to cause further incidents, and reserving the right to make legitimate demands.

<p>(Nanjing) The government stated that it has consistently adhered to international law, the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the League of Nations Covenant, and the repeated resolutions of the League of Nations Council regarding Japan's unprovoked armed aggression against the three northeastern provinces and important areas of China. It has requested the League of Nations and the signatory nations of these treaties to fulfill their sacred responsibilities under these agreements and impartially impose sanctions. However, Japan has blatantly disregarded these agreements and continued to trample upon them. Recently, Japanese forces have even fiercely attacked Shanghai, an international commercial center, forcing the Chinese authorities to adopt appropriate measures to exercise their legitimate right of national self-defense. Therefore, all responsibilities arising from this should be borne entirely by Japan. The Chinese government is currently following the League of Nations Council's resolution to avoid expanding the situation, limiting itself to legitimate self-defense, and awaiting the public judgment of the signatory nations of the aforementioned treaties and the League of Nations. It has not declared war on Japan. (2nd, special dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) The French Ambassador to the United States informed Secretary of State Stimson today that the rumors circulating recently about a Franco-Japanese understanding, in which France would allow Japan freedom of action in the Shanghai International Settlement and Japan would assist France at the disarmament conference, are unfounded. The French government denies this baseless talk. The Chargé d'Affaires also explained France's participation in the defense of the Shanghai International Settlement, stating that it first used police and troops to protect the French Concession in order to protect all foreigners, and then cooperated with representatives of other countries to jointly decide to protect the International Settlement. The instructions issued by the French government specifically stated that it had notified Japan that France considers respecting the International Settlement to be of paramount importance. The representative also informed the US government of France's actions at the League of Nations, especially regarding the investigation committee. The Chargé d'Affaires' declarations made a good impression at the State Department. (2nd, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) As rumors continued to circulate regarding the Far East, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, after receiving a report, declared to the representatives of this agency that there was absolutely no basis for the claim that France and Japan had entered into an agreement. Furthermore, the claim made by a certain German newspaper on January 26th that France had withdrawn 800 million francs from the French Bank's reserves to lend to Japan was also a fabrication.

<p>Only Willing to Provide Information to the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Geneva) Secretary-General Drummond of the League of Nations requested the United States to provide information regarding Shanghai. The U.S. reply was sent from the U.S. Consul General here, Gilchrist, today. The reply stated that although the U.S. government agreed to work with the Shanghai investigation team, it could not recognize itself as a member of the investigation team because the League of Nations Council's resolution on the appointment of the investigation team was not unanimous. However, the U.S. government would instruct the U.S. Consul General to provide the information it obtained to Drummond. Chinese Foreign Minister Luo Wengan telegraphed that the claim that China was preparing to declare war was inaccurate, stating that China was merely exercising its right to self-defense. Japan was brazenly pursuing its policy of violence and aggression, while China was faithfully fulfilling its international obligations. If the Japanese army did not commit atrocities, the Chinese would definitely not engage in hostile acts. Japanese representative Sato sent a telegram today alleging that Chinese soldiers had violated the declared truce in Shanghai and carried out a deceitful attack, forcing Japanese soldiers to retreat. Sato also requested the League of Nations to pay attention to what the Japanese called China's provocation plans, such as the dispatch of forty aircraft from Zhengzhou. Sato also published a day-by-day record of the Shanghai incident, based on Japanese telegrams, and concluded by saying that the Japanese were determined to cooperate with the Powers, that the Japanese authorities were in close contact with foreign consuls and military authorities, that the Japanese had no political ambitions in Shanghai, and that they did not want to harm the rights of the Powers.

<p>The London Daily News editorial this morning said that friends of Japan are now confused and are asking each other what the plans of the Japanese military to destroy Zhabei and bombard Nanjing will achieve. Japan is a great power, and it has always cherished its good reputation as a civilized nation, and its economic future is closely related to the development of the Chinese market. The points requested by the Japanese envoy Amau on Friday, which aimed to protect the safety and rights of the Japanese in Shanghai, have all been recognized by the local authorities, the only authorities capable of exercising any jurisdiction there. How will further action advance its legitimate interests? Other countries are alarmed by the armed conflict between the two member states of the League of Nations and cannot stand idly by. They may mediate, but they must protect the lives and rights of Europeans at any cost. (2nd, Reuters dispatch)</p>

Last week, Rear Admiral Shiozawa's order for aircraft to carry out barbaric bombings greatly damaged the feelings of foreigners, who had initially expressed sympathy for the Japanese government. It is now absolutely necessary for the civilian elements of the Tokyo government to regain control of their country's military. The Times also said that the warships and foreign troops gathered in Shanghai should agree on a unified command structure so that a decision can be made to deal with any sudden changes.

<h3 id="e31">Disarmament Conference Opens <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Henderson Delivers Speech</p>
<p>Unusually Large Japanese Delegation Attends</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Disarmament Conference opened this afternoon with 4,000 participants representing 64 countries, of which the Japanese delegation was the largest, with 90 people. At this time when the clouds of war in the Far East are still brewing, the eyes of the world are focused on the League of Nations. Some believe that the success of the League of Nations in resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute will be the great success of the Disarmament Conference. (2nd, Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although there were widespread rumors here that the Disarmament Conference would be temporarily postponed due to the Far East situation, people in the League of Nations strongly refuted this claim, saying that the Disarmament Conference would still open as scheduled on the afternoon of the 2nd, chaired by Henderson. Henderson gave a speech on the radio tonight, emphasizing the need to reduce armaments. All European broadcasting stations relayed it. (1st, National News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Disarmament Conference opened at 3:30 PM today. In his opening speech, Chairman Henderson said that it was regrettable that the war clouds in the Far East overshadowed the conference. He then urged the countries that signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact to exert their power to ensure strict adherence to the Pact. Henderson then asked the representatives to pay solemn attention to the world's eager hope for the conference, saying that the delegates represented the governments of sixty countries and 1.7 billion war-weary people. The world now fears that huge armaments are enough to endanger peace and security and struggles under the heavy burden caused by the world economic panic. For this reason, he did not fear failure and wished that the representatives would seize this opportunity to guide their people towards a high level of peace and cooperation.

As for the above opinions, for the first point, he questioned whether the Kuomintang could continue to maintain the country, whether it should be abolished or not should not be discussed.

For the third point, he was a man of guns and absolutely agreed: winning can certainly wash away the shame, and losing only means knowing one's death. (2nd, special dispatch)</p>

<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3 id="e42">Japanese Troops Break Faith, Open Fire and Throw Grenades Yesterday <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Two Aircraft Drop Bombs</p>
<p>Two Cannons Attack Our Defense Line</p>
<p>Our Troops Rise Up to Meet the Onslaught</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Results in Maintaining Original Defenses</p>
<p>On the 31st of last month, the British and American commanders, in order to mediate the war between the Chinese and Japanese armies, specially invited and gathered the Chinese and Japanese military authorities to negotiate a ceasefire. Although there were no concrete results, it was agreed by both sides to cease fire for three days. During this ceasefire period, both sides were to cease all attacks so that the Japanese Consul could consult with his government and then further negotiations could take place after a response was received. Our military authorities, in order to respect the agreement between the two sides, immediately ordered the frontline defense forces to cease all attacks. However, for three days, the Japanese troops did not keep their word. In various places northwest of North Sichuan Road, they frequently attacked our defense lines with machine guns and rifles. Although our troops were resentful of the Japanese side's unreasonableness, they had the orders of their superiors and never returned fire. At around 1:00 PM yesterday, the Japanese army again dispatched two military aircraft, which flew to the Zhabei-Zhenru area to conduct reconnaissance and then dropped several bombs, intending to bombard our army's defense lines. However, according to reports obtained by our military intelligence agencies, most of the bombs fell west of Qingyun Road, so the damage was minimal. Then, at around 3:00 PM, the Japanese Marines, from the direction of the Tiantong'an Railway Station, suddenly used two large-caliber cannons to bombard our army's defense lines in Zhabei. Our side believed that the Japanese army had broken the ceasefire agreement, attacking us at every turn, and in addition to the aircraft dropping bombs, they even used cannons to bombard us, which was truly intolerable. Therefore, all the soldiers on the entire line immediately rose up to meet the onslaught. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the sound of artillery rumbled incessantly. At the same time, the sounds of machine guns and mortars could also be heard clearly. During the fiercest fighting, in the concession area, such as North Shaanxi Road, North Henan Road, North Zhejiang Road, and areas near the North Railway Station, the sound of gunfire and artillery was particularly clear. As a result, residents living north of the Suzhou River became greatly panicked and fled south in droves. For a time, crowds seeking refuge crowded the Henan Road Bridge, Pentang Lane, Garbage Bridge, and Nicheng Bridge, and the people were in a state of anxiety, with no hope for the day. According to another report, when the Japanese military cannons attacked us, machine guns were simultaneously used to fire at our troops from the direction of Qiujiang Road, Dade Lane, and Laobazi Road, Fusheng Road. Therefore, from 3:00 PM yesterday, along the Songhu Railway, from the North Railway Station northward to the Tiantong'an Railway Station, there was fighting along the entire line. As of 10:00 PM, when the reporter was drafting this report, the sound of gunfire had not yet stopped, but the sound of artillery had ceased at 5:00 PM. It is difficult to ascertain the extent of the losses on both sides in yesterday afternoon's battle for the time being, but according to military commanders, our troops are still resisting on the original defense lines and there have been no changes.</p>
<p>At around 4:45 AM yesterday morning, Japanese soldiers along Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road, Tiantong'an Road, North Henan Road, etc., suddenly violated the three-day ceasefire agreement and simultaneously used machine guns, mortars, and rifles to bombard our army's defense lines in various areas. At that time, the sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls, interspersed with the sound of mortars. Our army did not return fire because the agreement had not yet expired. However, the Japanese soldiers continued to fire as before, and the area around the Yokohama Bridge on Tiantong'an Road was the most intense. The firing gradually subsided at around 5:30 AM. As a result, there were no changes to our front line. Commander Cai, believing that the Japanese side had reneged on the agreement, immediately notified Mayor Wu to lodge a protest with the Japanese Consul.</p>

<p>Although Ceasefire Deadline Has Passed</p>
<p>Still Within Consultation Period</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Launch Sudden, Fierce Attack</p>
<p>Responsibility Should Be Borne by Japan</p>
<p>After mediation by the British and American Consuls, etc., in the Zhabei battle, both sides temporarily ceased fire for a period of three days. According to the Headquarters and the City Government, the three-day period would not expire until around 4:00 or 5:00 PM today (the 3rd). However, yesterday, the Japanese troops violated the ceasefire agreement and resumed attacking us with cannons, machine guns, etc., at 1:20 PM. The City Government therefore lodged a formal protest with the British, American, and Japanese Consuls at around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Notice to Consuls of All Countries: The City Government informs the British, American, and other Consuls General that, regarding the Japanese Navy's invasion and attack on Zhabei, the respective Consuls General were previously notified. Subsequently, in order to maintain peace and avoid war, the British and American Consuls General invited the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the military commanders of all countries to a meeting at the British Consul General's residence on January 31. During the meeting, the British military commander suggested ways to avoid conflict between the two armies and agreed that the Japanese Consul General would consult with the Japanese government for a period of three days. If the Japanese government did not agree, then this government would consult with our national government. During this consultation period, both sides would not invade or attack each other. All of the above is on record. However, since that meeting, Japanese troops have repeatedly attacked our national troops. Then, at 2:50 PM today, this government suddenly received a telephone notification from the Japanese Consul General's office stating that the Japanese government did not agree with the aforementioned proposed measures. This is extremely surprising. Furthermore, one hour before this government received notification from the Japanese Consul General's office, Japanese troops had resumed attacking our troops stationed in Zhabei and arbitrarily bombed the area with aircraft. As the Japanese side has violated the agreement and disregarded the safety of the lives and property of our Chinese people and foreign nationals in Shanghai, and has restarted hostilities, all responsibility should be borne entirely by the Japanese government. In addition to lodging a protest with the Japanese Consul General, we hereby declare and inform the respective Consuls General, requesting your kind attention and upholding of justice. Respectfully addressed to the British and American Consuls General stationed in Shanghai and the Consuls General of all countries.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Bombings in Nanshi Yesterday <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The Poisonous Nature of Japanese Plainclothes Teams and Aircraft</p>
<p>Investigation into the Names and Injuries of the Dead and Wounded</p>
<p>In the Chinese-controlled Nanshi area, at around 2:00 PM yesterday, Japanese plainclothes teams suddenly appeared and threw bombs in various places. At the same time, Japanese aircraft were spotted in the air, and the situation suddenly became tense. Residents fleeing to the French Concession caused traffic jams, and martial law was immediately declared in the Chinese area, cutting off transportation. According to detailed investigations, the bomb throwers were bought out by Japanese plainclothes teams, intending to disrupt order. The details are recorded below: (Fangbang Road) At 3:10 PM yesterday afternoon, a bomb was found to have exploded in front of the Guangfu Temple gate in Zhaofang Lane, Fangbang Road, injuring Chen Gu, a woman from Nanjing, in her left arm, and Ma Genlin, a man from Suzhou. According to Mrs. Chen, she witnessed the injured Ma Genlin being one of the bomb throwers. Our volunteer army and the police of the First Precinct of the Second District immediately arrested Ma and another man named Huang Fengcai from Sichuan and sent them to the General Bureau. After a strict interrogation by the Judicial Section, Ma confessed that he was bribed by Japanese plainclothes teams and that accomplices were hiding at No. 2 Renlin Lane, Lagenac Road, in the French Concession. Based on the confession, the Bureau Chief immediately ordered four detectives to bring Ma and a warrant to the Songshan Road police station and dispatched detectives to arrest them at the address, but those individuals had already fled upon hearing the news, leaving only an empty house. (Nine Acres) At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a bomb was thrown in front of No. 1 Anren Lane, Dajing Road, Nine Acres, injuring a Mrs. Li in her left foot, but her injuries were minor. (Minguo Road) At 3:30 PM in the afternoon, a bomb fell on Minguo Road, Fuyou Road, injuring a passerby's left ear. (Huajin Road) At around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, a bomb fell in front of Chen Longfa Red Wood Works at No. 75 Huajin Road, Nanshi, shattering several panes of glass and injuring Zhu Gongying from Anhui, Huang Amao from Zhenjiang, and Huang Xiaogen from Ningbo, all employees of the store. (City God Temple) At around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, a bomb fell beside the Nine-Turn Bridge in the City God Temple in Nanshi, but it did not explode because it fell into the water.</p>
<p>Also, according to Xin Sheng She, at 2:45 PM yesterday afternoon, a Japanese aircraft circled the vicinity of the City God Temple several times, then dropped several bombs before flying elsewhere. Later, it flew over the Jiangmian River outside Xinkai River for a long time and dropped another bomb, seemingly intending to bomb a Chinese vessel in the river, but it missed and fell into the Xinkai River. At the same time, Japanese ronin disguised as Chinese people were throwing bombs in Fangbang Bridge, Houjia Lane, and Fuyou Road. (Casualties) No less than ten bombs were dropped in various places, and the damage was quite extensive. The shops near the Nine-Turn Bridge in the City God Temple were mostly destroyed, and several houses in Fangbang Bridge and Houjia Lane were also partially destroyed. The damage to Xinkai River was slightly less severe, but four or five pedestrians were seriously injured. Five or six people were injured, to varying degrees, in the City God Temple and Houjia Lane in the city. However, Tang Jin, a woman from Nanjing (26 years old) living at No. 4 Changkang Lane, Fangbang Bridge, died after her back was torn apart by a bomb, with her skin split open and bones and muscles severely damaged. She was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, but to no avail. (Investigation of the Injured) The injured were sent by nearby beat police officers to the Red Cross Society's downtown branch for treatment. Because the Red Cross Society did not have enough space, they were transferred to Shanghai Hospital. The names of the injured are listed below: (1) Xu Zhaodu, from Changzhou, 18 years old, a coppersmith, living at No. 137 Wangyun Road, injured his left leg in Fangbang Bridge; (2) Zhou Kunhu, from Wuxi, 39 years old, living in Houjia Lane, injured his foot; (3) Liu Hua (female), from Pudong, 50 years old, living in Houjia Lane, injured her hand; (4) Chen Gu (female), 48 years old, from Nanjing, injured her foot, living at No. 9 Hongfu Lane, Fangbang Road; (5) Yao Shouda, from Wuxi, 34 years old, injured various parts of his hands and feet; (6) Shao Baofu, from Changzhou, 20 years old, living at the City God Temple, Nine-Turn Bridge, injured his foot; (7) Bu Qinglai, 21 years old, from Menghe, living at No. 111 Jinjia Lane, injured his abdomen near Guangfu Temple; (8) Sun Ayuan (female), 18 years old, from Jiangbei, living in Anren Lane, injured her left leg on Catholic Church Street; (9) Shi Liu (female), 47 years old, living at No. 3 Anren Lane, injured her left leg in Xiaopi Lane; (10) Gu Zhichun, from Shanghai, 32 years old, living in Shuimozhai Cigarette Shop in the City God Temple, injured his left leg in Huxin Pavilion; (11) Yao Jintou, 34 years old, from Wuxi, living in Zhoujin Archway, injured his foot; (12) Chen Er, 27 years old, from Jiangbei, a rickshaw puller, living at No. 35 Sangyuan Street, injured various parts of his hands and feet; (13) Jin Sheng, from Changzhou, 21 years old, living in Longde Street, Dadongmen, injured his foot; (14) Wang Amao (female), 17 years old, from Zhenjiang, living at No. 75 City God Temple, slightly injured; (15) Zhang Ruilin, 24 years old, from Jiangbei, a rickshaw puller, living at No. 335 Taiping Street, Hongqiao, injured various parts of his hands and feet; (16) Shi Changqing, from Chongming, 38 years old, living outside Xiaodongmen, injured his head; (17) Wu Agou, 19 years old, from Changzhou, living in the City God Temple, injured his right leg; (18) Wang Zhang (female), 32 years old, from Ningbo, living at No. 1 Anren Lane, City God Temple, injured her right lower leg; (19) Ye Jiang (female), 19 years old, living at No. 35 Anshen Street, injured her right breast; (20) Shi Ji (female), 47 years old, from Jiangbei, living on Catholic Church Street; (21) Bei Fusong, 27 years old, from Hebei, living in Houjia Lane; (22) Gu Zhichun, 32 years old, from Shanghai, living on Yuyuan Road.</p>

<p>French Consul General Indignant</p>
<p>At 1:35 PM yesterday afternoon, two Japanese aircraft suddenly appeared in the sky over the French Concession, circling for a long time, refusing to leave, causing great panic among the residents, who fled indoors in droves. Finally, the two aircraft flew eastward together and dropped a bomb, which landed on the roof of the four-story Ping An Hotel at No. 14 Zhubaoshan Road, blowing a hole in the tin roof and injuring the hotel's receptionist, He Hancheng, from Hubei (39 years old, head injury). His injuries were serious, and he was taken to the hospital for treatment by car. The hotel's accounting department immediately reported to the Grand Clock Tower Police Station, which relayed the information to Police Commissioner Fessenden and French Consul General Koechlin. Fessenden and Koechlin were extremely indignant upon hearing the news. Moreover, residents within the concession generally believe that Japanese aircraft have been dropping bombs in the French Concession since the morning of the second day of the outbreak of the war. At that time, the public was already extremely concerned about security within the concession. Although the French authorities have repeatedly and solemnly declared that they are responsible for protection, people are still uneasy. Now, a second bombing has taken place on Zhubaoshan Road, only a short distance from the French Consulate, which means that the lives and property of hundreds of thousands of residents in the concession have virtually lost their guarantee. Moreover, the French flag is flying high above the French Consulate, and the Japanese aircraft can clearly see it. Now, they are bombing recklessly, regardless of everything, which shows the malicious intentions of the Japanese aircraft in general.</p>

<p>Artillery Shells Fall in Pudong: At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a shrapnel shell flew from the Yangshupu direction and struck the British-owned Longmao Warehouse at Lujiazui in Pudong, blowing open the door of Warehouse No. 14. The shell landed and exploded, creating numerous shrapnel holes in the muddy ground in front of the door. Fortunately, no one was injured. Zhang Mingqin, the district chief of the Third District of the Public Security Bureau, reported to the General Bureau after receiving the report and requested instructions. The area around Pudong is still safe for now. Ningbo natives living there have been boarding ships to return to Ningbo to seek refuge.</p>
<p>Kawasha County Magistrate Reports an Alarm: Li Leng, the county magistrate of Kawasha, sent a report to the Garrison Headquarters and a letter to the Pudong Compatriots Association, reporting that Bailonggang, Lao Hongwa, Xujia Road, and the newly opened Qinglonggang are all gateways to the sea, related to the security of the seven counties. Japanese warships are sailing back and forth on the sea, one after another. Currently, four warships and one aircraft carrier are anchored, and more than ten aircraft are circling everywhere. Sometimes, small boats patrol, and at midnight, searchlights probe the sea, as if they are surveying the terrain in preparation for landing. He has transferred the police captain of the Public Security Bureau and the police force to coordinate with the defense regiment, contact the Provincial Water Police, and transfer the guerrillas of the three counties of Nan, Feng, and Chuan to deploy and station troops there.</p>
<p>Gunfire at Texaco Storage: Dalu News reported that on the morning of yesterday (the 1st), a Japanese warship suddenly opened fire with machine guns at the Texaco oil storage facility in Pudong, injuring a farmer. A certain amount of kerosene stored in the Texaco Company's sheds was burned away. According to later explanations, those on the Japanese warship heard the sound of firecrackers in a certain village in Pudong and, fearing an attack, opened fire. Texaco has now asked the U.S. Consulate to formally protest to the Japanese Consul.</p>

<p>Kobatashi's False Alarm: Yesterday's newspaper reported that Japanese soldiers had landed in Kobatashi, but this was actually caused by ignorant villagers setting off firecrackers. According to a villager from that town who came to Shanghai, there is a place called Xiaosha in that town, bordering the Huangpu River, with a small market town and a police station with three police squads stationed there (sent by the Third District, Fourth Station of Kobatashi). There is a barber shop in the town, and at 11:00 PM the night before last, the shop's employees finished their feast and set off firecrackers, which was heard by the soldiers on two Japanese warships anchored there. Suspecting that there were Chinese soldiers stationed there, they dispatched more than ten Japanese soldiers, who boarded sampans and landed on the sandbar to investigate. When the villagers, women, and children saw the Japanese soldiers, they fled in droves, and the police also fled back to the Kobatashi police station to report the alarm. For a time, the rumors spread, mistakenly believing that Japanese soldiers had already landed. After the Japanese soldiers investigated and found no traces of Chinese soldiers, they returned to the warship on sampans, and a false alarm came to an end. Afterward, the police from the Third District, Fourth Station of Kobatashi went to the sandbar and summoned the owner of the barber shop to the station, reprimanding him for violating police regulations and parading him through the nearby villages as a warning.</p>

<p>Dedicate Pure Hearts and Pure Blood to the Party and the Nation</p>
<p>Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Dai Ji, and other generals of the 19th Route Army yesterday telegraphed the whole country, expressing their dedication of pure hearts and pure blood to the Party and the nation. The original text is transcribed below: Respectfully addressed to the Central Party Headquarters in Luoyang, Chairman Lin of the National Government, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang, ministers of various ministries, provinces, cities, party headquarters at all levels, governments at all levels, armies, divisions, brigades, various mass organizations, and all newspapers: The violent Japanese are implementing their policy of military aggression, pouring out their national strength in an attempt to annex our territory and exterminate our nation. After the three northeastern provinces were occupied, they unleashed their military might in the Yangtze River basin. We had no choice but to engage in self-defense. The central government, because the capital was in danger and constantly under the threat of enemy artillery fire, decisively and without hesitation moved to Luoyang. This is the same as the move of the French capital to Bordeaux and the Turkish capital to Ankara, a necessary policy for resisting the enemy and preserving the nation. Armed comrades and all the people of the country are fortunate to have a government that can safely exercise its powers to lead the national struggle. There is no room for doubt or criticism. Now that the enemy is penetrating deeper and the country is on the verge of destruction, all of us who have blood and spirit must display a united spirit of devotion to death, eliminate the evil habits of disparagement and infighting, and wipe away all differences of private opinion and dreams of power. Our 19th Route Army is ordered to defend the territory, exercising the natural duty of safeguarding against calamity and the righteousness of self-defense. With a single mind and a shared determination to protect our breasts and sever our heads, we are sacrificing every last bullet and every last soldier. We have no concerns about the remoteness of the central government or the difficulty of reinforcements. Armed comrades across the country, inspired by the conscience of patriotism and self-defense, fight on their own. In their defense of the territory, when the enemy comes, they will fight to the death. Success or failure, gain or loss, is not to be considered. We deeply believe that those who struggle will not perish, that those who uphold justice will be victorious. If there is justice in the world, the violent Japanese will never succeed. We especially hope that the central committee members and political leaders scattered in all directions will display their ambition to save the nation from peril and devote themselves to dealing with the crisis that hangs by a thread. The ancients said, "Under an overturned nest, there are no intact eggs." Those who do not save themselves will only commit suicide. Our 19th Route Army soldiers dedicate pure hearts and pure blood to the Party and the nation, to all the people. Our countrymen and gentlemen, hear this last cry of sorrow. May they also understand our sincerity and forgive our bluntness. Respectfully, Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Dai Ji, and all officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army. Winter.</p>

<p>Brigade Commander Weng's message to all officers and soldiers on the entire line: Loyal and courageous officers and soldiers, the life and death of the Chinese nation rests on our shoulders. Everyone must truly take on our responsibilities, promote the spirit of our Iron Army, and maintain our glorious history of the past. The Japanese army is considered the strongest in the world, and we must annihilate this strongest army in the world, seize the position of first in the world, and create a new Iron Army honor. Loyal and courageous officers and soldiers, this opportunity is rare. To sacrifice for the country and the nation is glorious even in death. Everyone must not miss this opportunity to serve the country. Everyone should make the most of their usual calm spirit, not panic, aim your guns, and be sure to kill an enemy with every bullet. At the very least, make the bullets fly past the enemy's ears to scare him so that he doesn't dare to lift his head. When the bullets are used up, use bayonets to kill the enemy. When the bayonets are broken, use gun barrels to strike the enemy. When the gun barrels are broken, use your fists to beat the enemy. If your fists hurt, you still have your teeth to bite the enemy. Loyal and courageous officers and soldiers, it is better to be a ghost under the gun than a slave of a fallen country. Work hard, struggle, and persevere to the end. The rebirth of the nation is at this moment. Everyone, charge up and kill to your heart's content. Our slogans are: Unity of the military and civilians, resist Japanese aggression, vow to seek independence for the country, and vow to seek survival for the nation. Long live the Republic of China!</p>

<p>And Denial of Declaration of War to Various Circles in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, leaders of Shanghai's various public organizations held a temporary emergency meeting to discuss strategies for dealing with the Shanghai Incident. After the meeting, the Foreign Affairs Discussion Association, based on the intentions of all parties, sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, stating roughly that Japanese representative Sato's report to the League of Nations falsely accused the cause of the Shanghai Incident as stemming from attacks by our troops on Japanese marines who were landing to protect their nationals, followed by attacks on the Japanese military headquarters, hence the Japanese military acted in self-defense, etc. Our diplomatic authorities should be responsible for promptly instructing our chief representative Yan Huaiqing to strongly refute this, to prevent the world from being deceived and Japan from concealing the truth. At the same time, the telegram also inquired of the Foreign Ministry whether it would be appropriate for our country to declare war. Since Japan has been waging war without a declaration, and we are also mobilizing the entire nation to resist to the death, not declaring war would be the best strategy, etc. Yesterday, we received a reply telegram from the Foreign Ministry as follows: "The telegram has been received. In the Shanghai Incident, China is exercising the legitimate right of self-defense permitted by law and is by no means declaring war on Japan. The statements by the National Government and Minister Luo are very clear. It is hoped that this will be explained in detail to all parties to avoid misunderstandings. As for the Japanese representative's fabricated claim in the League of Nations that the Shanghai Incident was initiated by attacks from Chinese troops, Representative Yan has been instructed to strongly refute it. Special reply, Eastern Division, Asian Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs."</p>

<p>Proclamation by the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued a proclamation saying: "Regarding the matter of this proclamation, the Japanese side, under the pretext of the Ma Yushan Road incident, put forward four demands, forcing us to accept them. Our municipal government, seeking to preserve the overall situation, already responded to them on the 28th of this month. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the same day, the Japanese military issued another ultimatum, demanding that our troops cede the defense area in Zhabei. Without waiting for a reply, they openly fired on us, even throwing grenades into the streets and bombing civilian houses. Our military and police have a duty to defend the territory and have no choice but to undertake legitimate defense to protect themselves. However, the Shanghai-Songhu area is a major commercial port where people from friendly nations gather. The sudden outbreak of war is truly unfortunate. However, considering the long-standing friendship between our country and various friendly nations, people from all walks of life should understand this, protect foreign merchants equally, and strengthen good relations. In addition to ordering all military and police to pay close attention to protecting foreign merchants, this proclamation is hereby issued to all sectors of society for their information. No violations are permitted. This proclamation is of utmost importance. The Commander, Dai Ji, February, Year 21 of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>First to Resist Japan</p>
<h3 id="e54">Battle Experiences of the 6th Regiment's Soldiers <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter from Huadong News Agency visited the regimental headquarters of the 6th Regiment in Zhabei and met with Regiment Commander Zhang Jun, who detailed the regiment's combat situation, saying: "Our regiment was established less than three months ago, and most of the soldiers are new recruits. Therefore, after returning from Jiangxi and being stationed in Kunshan, Taicang, and other places, we were intensifying training. Zhabei, Shanghai, was originally garrisoned by the 2nd Regiment of the Ministry of Finance's Tax Police. After the regiment was ordered to be reorganized, our regiment began to move here from Taicang on January 6th, with the 3rd Battalion stationed in Zhabei and the 1st and 2nd Battalions stationed in Dachangzhen. I was also concurrently appointed by Commander Dai of the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison as the director of the Shanghai Military Police National Joint Office, commanding a company of military police at the North Railway Station, a platoon of railway artillery, and the 3rd and 4th Police Teams, as well as the forces of various defense groups, bearing the complete responsibility for the security of Zhabei. After the Japanese thugs set fire to our Sanyou Factory on January 20th, in order to maintain the security of Zhabei, I transferred the two battalions stationed in Dachang to reinforce the defense and set up defensive works along the Songhu Railway at the junction of the Chinese and foreign concessions, at the Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road intersection, the Yokohama Road, Guangdong Road intersection, and other places, and implemented strict precautions to prevent riots by Japanese thugs. On the evening of the 28th, at 11:30 PM, we suddenly received a report that the Japanese Marine Corps was plotting to invade Zhabei. I immediately urgently transferred the 1st and 2nd Battalions to reinforce the area from the North Railway Station to Qingyun Road, pre-arranging a defensive line, with a total force of less than 1,000 men. At the same time, I followed the command of our senior officers, including Commander Cai, Division Commander Qu, and Brigade Commander Weng. At 12:00 AM, before our troops had completed their deployment, the Japanese Marine Corps launched a full-scale attack, with more than ten armored vehicles, fifty motorcycles, and bomb squads and machine gun teams charging fiercely at our defensive line five or six times. The pressure was extremely critical. Fortunately, our officers and soldiers were determined to resist to the death and finally repelled the Japanese army, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese military, capturing five armored vehicles and several motorcycles, and seizing countless weapons and prisoners. Our army suffered more than 300 casualties, and all the officers led by example. Therefore, the deputy battalion commander of the 1st Battalion, Lu Bin, the company commander of the 1st Machine Gun Company, Zhang Jinshan, and the company commander of the 9th Company of the 3rd Battalion, Lin Yu, as well as three officers, including the deputy company commander Tan Shaonian, all died in battle. That night, the ability to defeat 3,000 Japanese soldiers with a small force was due to the proper command of our senior officers, including Commander Cai, Division Commander Qu, and Brigade Commander Weng, as well as the participation in the battle of the 1st Battalion of our 5th Regiment, the 1st Company of the 6th Military Police, the Railway Artillery Team, the assistance of the 3rd and 6th Police Teams and various police corps, and the brave efforts of our soldiers. At that time, there was a squad leader in the 1st Battalion named Pan Dezhang who had been hit in the head by a bullet. He retreated to untie his leg wrappings, bandaged the wound, and then returned to the front line to attack and kill the enemy, demonstrating extraordinary bravery and showing no signs of pain. More than ten people from the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were slightly wounded in the hands and feet. I ordered them all to be treated and returned to camp to apply medicine, but they all said that they must each kill ten Japanese soldiers before returning. The morale was unprecedentedly brave and angry. Now, the wounded soldiers in the rear are still frequently urging the medical officers to quickly heal their wounds so that they can return to the front line to kill the enemy. On the 29th, at dawn, our Brigade Commander Weng personally led two battalions of the 5th Regiment, one battalion of the 60th Division, and two battalions of the 6th Military Police, as well as the Fudan University Volunteer Army, to increase the fighting force. Our army's position became more consolidated. Despite the enemy using aircraft to drop more than a hundred sulfur bombs in our rear, bombing and burning Zhabei everywhere, our army not only showed no fear but also used it as a stimulant for our soldiers, increasing their courage to kill the enemy and shooting down three enemy aircraft. Therefore, at 10:00 PM that night, we also had a civilian dare-to-die team creating chaos in the enemy's rear. Our army finally defeated the enemy, occupying Tiantong'an and the Japanese Elementary School, and the Japanese Naval Headquarters, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese soldiers and seizing countless enemy weapons. With nowhere to go, the Japanese army retreated and fled to the Public Concession. On the 30th, we followed the order of our Commander Cai and respected the requests of the British and American forces to completely cease fire. However, the barbarous Japanese military continued to fire at our positions. On the morning of the 31st, our Commander Cai, in response to the requests of various consuls, sent our Division Commander Qu to attend a meeting for negotiations and put forward several conditions, the most important of which were that the Japanese army must withdraw from the Wusongkou within a time limit, compensate us for our losses, and apologize to our country, etc. While negotiations were underway, more than ten Japanese aircraft flew to our positions again, attempting to carry out various conspiracies. Our Division Commander Qu immediately stood up and protested, and the consuls also questioned the Japanese Commander Shi Yanze, who then ordered the flights to stop. However, in the past two days, the Japanese side has not stopped attacking. The barbarity and unreasonableness of the Japanese have been fully demonstrated. In short, since the resistance began on the evening of the 28th, although our regiment has suffered more than half casualties, our front-line officers and soldiers have not retreated half a step. Only those from the rear are continuously arriving at the front line. We only know that we have a nation, a territory, and a duty. To the last soldier, we will still defend Zhabei to the death. Although the negotiations have not yet concluded, we respect the reasonable [&gt;</p>

<p>intentions of the various consuls. The righteous indignation of the various friendly military and police corps and their brave killing of the enemy are truly gratifying. We are also deeply grateful for the various consolations from the people of all walks of life, and we are even more ashamed of the various encouragements from the press. We hope that all Chinese citizens will unite and prepare to go to the front line to overthrow Japanese imperialism," and so on. According to reports, Regiment Commander Zhang Jun, also known as Zhang Yuezhong, is from Hepu, Guangdong, and is 34 years old. He graduated from the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy. He served as a company commander and deputy battalion commander in the 1st Division of the Guangdong Army, battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 32nd Regiment of the 4th National Revolutionary Army, lieutenant colonel and deputy regimental commander of the 5th Regiment of the Guangdong Garrison Army, commander of the Guangzhou Garrison Regiment, and commander of the 1st Regiment of the 1st Independent Brigade of the Guangdong Demobilization Area. He is currently the commander of the 6th Regiment of the 156th Brigade of the 78th Division of the 19th Route Army.

<p>The Da Mei Wan Bao reported that this newspaper learned this morning (2nd) that Japan had firmly rejected the major powers' proposal to establish a neutral zone in Shanghai. The Japanese government had notified the representatives of the major powers stationed in Shanghai of its decision. The reply was received this morning. Shanghai has become a vast battlefield. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France are now rushing troops from their bases and sending warships to Shanghai to protect the Public Concession and the French Concession. The 31st Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army stationed in the Philippines is being transported by the transport ship As Mang and is already on its way. Rear Admiral Turner, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, will arrive on Thursday with his flagship Houston and eight destroyers.

<p>Japanese Soldiers Detain and Kill Westerners, According to the Zi Lin Bao: Johnson, a 15-year-old American boy, was detained by the Japanese Marine Corps and Japanese merchant groups on Friday. He has now been released. After his detention, the U.S. Consulate protested to the Japanese Consul General, but the Japanese Consul denied that there was any detention. Zhuo (translation), the principal of the Second Middle School of Soochow University on Kunshan Road, was detained by a team of Japanese Marine Corps and merchant groups in front of the school at about 8:00 AM on Sunday. His whereabouts are still unknown. This morning, Hock, a representative of the U.S. Methodist Church, asked the U.S. Consul General to protest to the Japanese authorities. An Englishman, Ben Shengkeli, went to Sichuan Road by car on Sunday evening to rescue an elderly Chinese mother and has been missing since then. It is suspected that he has met with misfortune.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Shoot and Kill Chinese Children, According to the Da Lu Bao: Yesterday (1st), a Chinese child was bending down to pick up a stone, and was shot and killed by Japanese soldiers. The child was at the intersection of Pinlang Road and Robert's Road. A Japanese Marine Corps was passing by in a car when the child bent down to pick up the stone. The Japanese soldiers immediately opened fire. The bullet entered from the shoulder, passed through the entire body, and exited from the thigh. His family immediately carried the child into the house, but a few minutes later, the Japanese soldiers arrived, took the child's body, threw it into the car, and drove away quickly. The shooting location was within the patrolling area of the British soldiers.</p>
<p>The Tragic Situation in the Hongkou Area, According to the Da Mei Wan Bao: According to eyewitnesses in the Hongkou area, armed Japanese people are wantonly killing people without any scruples. The corpses of Chinese men, women, and children are piled up, and all the corpses are carried away by the Marine Corps patrol team and disposed of in the dark of night. If the Huangpu River could speak, it would probably be able to tell the tragic situation.</p>
<p>The Japanese Conspiracy is Terrible. According to reports yesterday, at 2:30 PM today, outside a car dealership at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Materhesi Road, there were five or six Japanese plainclothes men wearing Chinese clothes walking from west to east. They were spotted by the people standing on the street. Some people intended to step forward to inquire, but suddenly noticed that the Japanese men were burdened, and knew that they were carrying dangerous items, so they did not dare to pursue the matter. In recent days, there have been reports that some Japanese ruffians have changed into Chinese clothes and are carrying dangerous items, intending to disrupt order in the concession and harm the defense forces of various countries, Western police, and foreigners, in order to frame the Chinese. Their plan is extremely clever, and their hearts are extremely poisonous. All our people must remain calm and unite against Japan, and we hope that the Chinese directors will make a clear statement to the concession authorities and ask them to take precautions to avoid danger.</p>
<p>Throwing Corpses into the Suzhou River. The day before yesterday (1st) afternoon, more than 20 citizens successively passed through Robert's Road in western Shanghai and were stopped by Japanese soldiers and Japanese plainclothes men there. They were all captured into the Japanese China Cotton Mill, brutally tortured, and then killed. To destroy the evidence, the corpses were thrown into the nearby Suzhou River. After a while, more than 13 bodies floated on the surface of the water in succession. Another young child was also urinating facing the bamboo fence next to the road on the Pudong Road in western Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon when a Japanese soldier suddenly passed by and shot him. With a bang, the child died on the ground, and the Japanese soldier also threw the child's body into the nearby river. This kind of cruel behavior occurs frequently within the scope of violence. It is hoped that our citizens will be careful in their actions, otherwise, it will be tantamount to throwing themselves into the mouths of wolves.</p>

<p>Setting Up Headquarters Everywhere</p>
<p>After the failure of the two general attacks by the Japanese army, they repeatedly counterattacked. The Hongkou area is under particularly strict guard by the Japanese army. During this three-day ceasefire, they actively arranged defensive work. Several machine guns were specially erected on the roof of the Ritz Hotel under the Tushan Bridge, and a large number of Japanese troops were stationed indoors. The Japanese Telegraph Bureau on Tiantong Road also has the same arrangement. Barbed wire is densely arranged in the alleys around the Tulang area at the head of Wusong Road, and heavy troops are stationed there. Most of the nearby empty houses have been secretly hidden by Japanese troops.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Japanese army, located at the Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road, has been relocated several times since it was occupied by our army. Now that the country's troops have been retreating eastward, the battle line has gradually shifted from the north area to the east area, so the eastern Hongkou area has become tense. The Hongkou Police Station on Yihang Road has now been used by the Japanese army as a headquarters. All the Chinese, Western, and Indian detectives of the police station have been transferred to other police stations.</p>
<p>The residence of Tang Shaoyi on Laobazhi Road is now located in the war zone. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met with a servant of the Tang residence yesterday, who said that the residence has now been forcibly occupied by the Japanese army as a headquarters, and all the Chinese people in the residence have been expelled.</p>
<p>Since yesterday, Japanese troops have entered the Hongkou Hotel at the corner of North Sichuan Road and Haining Road to work, and a Japanese flag has been hung on the roof.</p>

<p>Authorities Find Ways to Deal With It</p>
<p>The Toyota Cotton Mill in Van Wangdu, western Shanghai, is a famous cotton mill owned by the Japanese in Shanghai. All the employees in the factory are Japanese. After the outbreak of the war, about 500 Japanese marines went to the area to garrison. Two cannons and several machine guns were erected on the roof, and the situation was very serious. Residents living in the surrounding area have all moved away. Our military authorities believe that the area is located in the Chinese territory and is in a strategic location. If dangerous goods are allowed to be erected and Japanese troops are allowed to occupy it, it will seriously hinder the security of the Chinese territory and the nearby concessions and will affect military progress. It is heard that heavy troops were sent to surround it yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Kiwa, Robert's Road, Western Shanghai. Landmines were buried in the Japanese merchant Kiwa Cotton Mill yesterday. After a certain agency reported it, it immediately conducted a thorough investigation and found that the news was true. In addition to starting to take precautions, it is also planning necessary countermeasures.</p>

<p>No Japanese Ships Entered the Port Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, Japanese merchant ships in China have been sailing under the supervision of warships. At first, they were still sailing as usual, and the Chinese employees and sailors on board did not dare to express anything. However, yesterday, the Chinese crew and stokers on board the Nissin and Osaka merchant ships all left the ships and went on strike when the ships arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, the Japanese ships could not operate. Since yesterday, Japanese ships have not entered the Huangpu River.</p>

<p>The war has resumed, the situation is getting worse, the Jianghai transportation has been completely cut off, and the commerce between Shanghai and other ports has been completely interrupted. The Hua Merchants' Shipping Bureau, Sanbei, and other shipping bureaus in this port have completely stopped working since yesterday. Except for Shanghai and Ningbo, no other liners are sailing, and all cargo and passengers have been suspended.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Easing Financial Hardship and People's Food Supply <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce's Advice: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Rice Merchants Guild, requesting them to notify all rice shops not to raise rice prices, so as not to hinder the people's food supply. The letter stated: "On the 2nd of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Committee, stating that as national disaster looms, the life and social order of all residents of Shanghai depend on rice and grain. According to our investigation, the city of Shanghai has a large stock of rice and grain, sufficient to feed the people. However, we have heard that a small number of rice shops, disregarding the public interest, are hoarding and manipulating prices, which is extremely deplorable. You must know that if we do not act with conscience and sacrifice ourselves to fight against the invading Japanese soldiers, the consequences will be unimaginable. Moreover, the price of rice and grain is of great importance to the stability of the market. Therefore, we specifically ask your guild to persuade all rice merchants to arouse their patriotic enthusiasm, sell at a uniform and fair price, to help the people's food supply and overcome the current difficulties." This was approved. Rice and grain are related to the people's food supply. At a time when Japanese invaders are invading and the people of the whole city are panicking, the rice and grain, which are essential for survival, are being raised in price, increasing by two or three yuan per picul compared to before the incident. The ordinary people of the city are already unable to avoid disaster, and the price of rice is increasing without limit. This is not in line with the purpose of fighting against the enemy with one heart and one mind, and the consequences will be unimaginable. Moreover, according to our investigation, the stock of rice in Shanghai is very large, so there is no need to panic excessively. Accordingly, we request your guild to consider the current difficulties and promptly notify all rice shops to sell at a uniform and fair price, and not to hoard goods for profit. This is of utmost importance."</p>
<p>The Investigation by the Public Works Department: On the morning of February 2nd, the investigation by the Public Works Department was as follows: (A) Meat: The Public Security Bureau's slaughterhouse slaughtered 23 cattle, 0 sheep, 23 calves, and 7 pigs in one day. On the morning of the 2nd, the stock of slaughtered livestock was 92 cattle, 0 sheep, 49 calves, and 41 pigs. The slaughterhouses are operating as usual, but the number of live animals is gradually decreasing. There are 100 slaughtered animals on Jiaxing Road that cannot be transported out. On Monday evening, the staff of the Public Security Bureau's livestock farm and slaughterhouse all dispersed. The Food Committee has now taken measures to protect these personnel and facilitate transportation, and has sent Russian volunteers to guard the area. The slaughterhouses in the French Concession are extremely busy, and many butchers from the International Settlement are operating there. However, the stock of live animals is gradually being exhausted, and no new supplies have arrived. (B) Rice and Flour: There is currently a ship docked at the wharf, carrying 7,000 tons of Indian rice. There is also a large stock of American wheat. (C) Vegetables: Good quality vegetables are being transported from Brenan Road and Great Western Road. The Western District vegetable market is operating as usual. Lettuce is slightly more expensive, and potatoes have doubled in price. The Seymour Road vegetable market is short of butter, sugar, and flour because wholesalers are unwilling to extend credit. Business in the Central District is as usual. There are many fish. The Northern District has almost come to a standstill, with only a few selling their stocks. The vegetable markets in the Eastern District are generally operating as usual (except for Wuzhou Road), but because most of the residents in the Eastern District have fled, there are fewer buyers.</p>
<p>Two Letters from the Tobacco and Cash Exchange Industry: The Shanghai Tobacco and Cash Exchange Association yesterday received a joint letter from the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhongnan Bank Preparatory Office, Sze Ming Bank, Commercial Bank of China, China Industrial Bank, China Reclamation Bank, and other banks, stating: "Dear Sirs, As we are currently in a period of business suspension, in order to facilitate the circulation of banknotes, we propose that your association convene the tobacco and cash exchange merchants to discuss temporary exchange measures, so as to avoid obstruction. We hereby inform you and hope to receive a reply." Upon receiving this letter, the association immediately convened its members for discussion and decided to reply to the banks as follows: "Dear Sirs, We have received your letter and understand its contents. We will immediately convene a meeting of our members, who have all agreed that each tobacco and cash exchange merchant will be limited to a maximum of 300 yuan for the daily exchange of various banknotes. A list will be submitted to our association for stamping, and the stamped list will be presented to the banks for exchange. The exchange hours will be from 9:00 to 11:00 a.m. and from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. from the 2nd to the 5th of this month, in order to facilitate circulation and avoid obstruction. We hereby send this letter for your information." In addition, the Tobacco and Cash Exchange Association submitted a document to the Bureau of Social Affairs, stating: "We are submitting this document to report that our affiliated merchants are not arbitrarily suppressing the exchange rate of silver dollars, and to explain the situation in detail, hoping for your review and filing. On the 1st of this month, we received your bureau's Instruction No. 714, which stated that since the diplomatic situation has become dangerous, the shops in this industry have been arbitrarily suppressing the exchange rate of silver dollars, which has had a significant impact on financial circulation. We hereby order your association to promptly instruct the merchants in this industry not to arbitrarily suppress the exchange rate, in order to maintain the market. Please report the handling situation for filing. We have received this instruction and have investigated that the affiliated members are facing a sharp drop in the exchange rate of silver dollars, and the outside world does not know the truth. There are many questions, so we convened a meeting of our members yesterday. They all agreed that the silver coins and copper coins exchanged by the tobacco and cash exchange industry have always been bought from small coin exchange shops or collected from various shops outside the industry. This time, the market is volatile, and the coin exchange industry has suspended operations. Although there are a few small coin exchange shops that can still be purchased from, the market is scarce, and the purchase price is only ten cents and five li. The copper coins are also only around 2,250 cash. The shops outside the industry are also hoarding goods for profit, and it is impossible to collect them, which makes it difficult for members to operate. There is no surplus profit to be made, and there is no arbitrary suppression. If the financial circulation is smooth, there will be no such problems. This cannot be solely blamed on the tobacco and cash exchange industry. The silver and coin industries should also be held jointly responsible. Our affiliated members are now seeking a fundamental solution and have already agreed on temporary measures to send a letter to the financial community to find ways to maintain stability, so as to reassure the people and maintain the market situation. Due to the previous instructions, we hereby submit this document for your review and filing, which would be in the public interest."</p>

<p>Zhou Fengqi, the former commander of the 26th Army of the National Revolutionary Army, was deeply angered by the advancing Japanese invaders and decided to rise up and support the fight against the enemy. He sent a telegram yesterday, which read (abbreviated title): "To all newspaper offices and the elders and compatriots of the country: The Japanese have been acting recklessly, oppressing our country like a ravenous wolf. They have already wreaked havoc in the Northeast and are now disturbing our seaports. Tianjin and Fuzhou have successively sounded the alarm. Now, they are openly ravaging Shanghai, the international commercial center, setting fires, plundering, killing, and stealing, committing all kinds of cruel and heinous acts that make people's eyes crack and their hair stand on end. Our authorities are overly cautious and trust others too much. The credibility of the League of Nations is completely unreliable. The cries in the Qin court are heard by few. The Japanese are only using delaying tactics, while advancing step by step and inch by inch against our country. In the recent battle of Shanghai, fortunately, our 19th Route Army has been loyal, brave, and determined to fight for the dignity of the people and the survival of the country. The fighting has lasted for three days, shocking the world. As a soldier, I am deeply saddened by these disasters. I believe that even the common people have a duty to defend their country, and I dare not forget my determination to fight for my country. At this critical moment of national survival, those who are brave should use their strength, those who are wise should use their intelligence, and the whole country should support the front lines. We must act quickly and dare not hesitate. I am willing to fight against the enemy and vow to fight to the death. We must share the same hatred and never give up until we have avenged our country. Furthermore, I have something more to say. Now that the country is in trouble, resisting the enemy is of utmost importance. The whole country should rise up and resist the Japanese invaders, put an end to internal conflicts, and unite as one. We should not dwell on the past, but forge a new path. I sincerely hope that all the wise men and experienced comrades in the country will work together and share their responsibilities, thwart the cunning enemy abroad, and eliminate internal disputes, so as to preserve the dignity of our Chinese nation. I hereby appeal to you and respectfully ask for your understanding. Zhou Fengqi bows in winter."</p>

The Qingyun Bridge Public Hospital in Zhabei had four or five wounded soldiers who had run out of food. Xue Zhenyi of the Chinese Red Cross Society Rescue Team sent food to help them. At the same time, he cooperated with the Coal Industry Association to rescue hundreds of refugees and send them to the Jing'an Temple Refugee Shelter. The Third Team of the Chinese Red Cross Society, led by Hai Zongqi, rescued two refugees and 36 women and children at Yongxing Road, Baoshan Road, and Xinhe Road on Qujiang Road in Zhabei this morning at 8:00 a.m. when stray bullets struck. The Sixth Detachment of the Chinese Red Cross Society Rescue Team, because the front-line military doctors were insufficient, the entire medical staff decided to take shifts from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. every day to serve on the front line, and also assigned guards to wait at night. The Sixth Rescue Detachment rescued Gao Shengzhou, a wounded soldier from the First Company of the First Battalion of the Sixtieth Division, who was shot in the right shoulder on Qingyun Road in Zhabei yesterday morning at 8:00 a.m. and sent him to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road.

This was previously reported in this newspaper. This morning, Mr. Lin sent another urgent telegram to the Yangon General Chamber of Commerce in Myanmar, and forwarded it to various overseas Chinese groups and newspapers in the region. The original text is as follows: "The Japanese army is invading, bombing the Zhabei area, and shooting civilians, which is inhuman. The war zone is now expanding, and casualties are piling up. The situation is tragic and infuriating. Therefore, we urgently appeal for the rapid collection of large sums of money to assist the Red Cross Society in aiding refugees."</p>
<p>Refugee Overseas Chinese Temporary Residence: The Private Overseas Chinese Middle School at 103 Seymour Road in this city was founded by returning overseas Chinese. It was originally scheduled to open on the 15th of this month. Now, in light of the displacement of refugees, especially those overseas Chinese who have suffered this disaster, the entire school building will be temporarily converted into a temporary residence for refugee overseas Chinese, accommodating over 200 people. Many people have already moved in. Any refugee compatriots with reliable guarantees, regardless of gender, can register there and stay temporarily free of charge. This act of kindness is truly a blessing for overseas Chinese refugees in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Special Train to Transport Refugees: This time, the Japanese soldiers invaded Zhabei, and residents fled to the concessions. However, more than 50,000 people, mostly poor, have not left. Cai Tingkai, commander of the 19th Route Army, is deeply concerned about this. Therefore, he sent a letter to Zhu Ziqiao and others the other day, asking them to find a way to rescue them from danger. It is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Joint Office is already working on this, and plans to send all the refugees to the interior of the Shanghai-Hangzhou line for resettlement within the next day or two. They have also consulted with Chen Xinghan, director of the two railway bureaus, who has agreed to provide a special train for transportation.</p>

Ling Youguang, an official of the rescue team, transferred the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch in the French Concession for burial because it was at night. However, the hall routinely issued wooden coffins for burial. That night, the director of the hall believed that the deceased soldier had sacrificed himself to defend the country and protect the people. His situation was pitiful, and it was unbearable to give him a coffin according to the regulations. Therefore, he ordered the staff to issue a high-quality coffin for burial to show excellence and comfort the soul, and notified the cemetery staff to insert a marker for future family recognition.</p>
<p>Blue Cross Facilitates Rescue: Mr. Zhang Deyi, director of the Qianyi Traumatology Hospital of the Zhabei Blue Cross, is famous for treating injuries and has saved countless lives. Now that the war has broken out in Shanghai, the hospital has organized a rescue team to rescue the wounded soldiers in the war zone. Because the hospital is located at the junction of the Chinese and Concession areas, and transportation has been blocked, it has moved to Liuying Bridge in Zhabei to facilitate rescue.</p>
<p>Coal Industry Association Sets Up Shelter: The Coal Industry Association specially established a battlefield refugee rescue team yesterday, and set up a refugee shelter at the old site of the Touji Bridge Japanese-Night Bank. The rescue team has dispatched staff to Zhabei to work since yesterday.</p>
<p>Church Members Work Hard: The War Zone Refugee Relief Association organized by various Christian groups in this city has been actively underway since its establishment. Church organizations are working hard to raise funds. As for the refugee shelters, it is heard that the Continental Arcade on Nanjing Road has temporarily housed the first, second, and third floors of the mall. Those who wish to donate funds are requested to submit them to Mr. Mei Lide, Treasurer of the Relief Association, at the Guangxuehui, A19 Fowu Yuan Road.</p>

<p>Xu Guisheng and his wife: At 10:00 AM on February 1, a woman with short hair was lost north of the New Garbage Bridge. She is 24 or 25 years old, from Henglin, Wuxi. Her husband's name is Xu Guisheng, a painter, living at 254 Beinanlin Lane, Zhabei. On the afternoon of the Zhabei incident on the 29th, at 2:00 PM, she fled to the concession with the Xu family, who were the second landlords. She stayed at the publishing house on Nanjing Road. On the 31st, she moved with the Xu family to 14 Xin Fang Ren An Lane, Guling Road, Nicheng Bridge. Because she had not seen her husband for several days, at 10:00 AM on February 1, she went to Zhabei alone over the New Garbage Bridge, probably lost in the confusion. She left behind a baby of several months, crying all day long, starving. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention to the investigation.

<p>Work Will Resume Today</p>
<p>The No. 1, 2, 3, and 4 routes of the Nanshi Chinese Merchants Tram suddenly stopped entirely yesterday afternoon, causing panic. In fact, this matter is unrelated to the current situation. The reason is that the company failed to pay wages due to the bank closure, so the drivers and ticket sellers went on strike. It is now heard that the matter is being persuaded by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and work will resume today as usual.</p>
<p>Police Brigade Sixth Squad Leader</p>
<h3 id="e78">Tan's Anti-Enemy Experience <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>When the Japanese army started attacking Zhabei this time, the first to bear the brunt was the sixth squad of the police brigade. Yesterday, the reporter visited Sun Mou, the captain of the squad, and asked about the anti-enemy experience. He kindly showed the diary of the battle, excerpts of which are as follows: (January 28) At 11:40 PM, the Japanese army, using armored vehicles, first rushed into the police sixth squad's defense area at Tiantong'an Jiangwan Road, sweeping with machine guns. The guards immediately counterattacked with rifles. Later, with the reinforcement of Captain Sun, the Japanese army was repelled. At the same time, on the front lines of Yokohama, Baoxing, Chuangong, Qiujiang, Fusheng, Zhejiang roads, and North Station, hearing the gunfire from the left wing Tiantong'an defense area, troops were also mobilized to prepare for resistance. As a result, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses, destroying three armored vehicles and suffering over 200 deaths and injuries. Our side only suffered fifty or so deaths and injuries from the sixth squad. (January 29) After the defeat, at about 8:00 PM, the Japanese army launched a general attack again at 8:00 PM. The firepower was especially intense. Because we had strong defensive works in all aspects, and shot from walls and rooftops, we inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese army. Until dawn, the Japanese army was defeated again. (January 30) At about 8:00 AM, the Japanese army, failing in the general offensive, used a poisonous tactic, using airplanes to drop bombs, causing our military police group office, North Station, Commercial Press, Fifth District Police Station, Baoxing Road intersection, etc. to be bombed with heavy bombs. At the same time, the Japanese side earnestly requested consuls of various countries to mediate and slow our attack. (January 31) Only outpost contact, gunshots sometimes stopped and sometimes started. Our army did not receive orders to attack and remained on the front line. In short, our 19th Route Army is indeed a battle-hardened and ever-victorious army, and controlling the enemy was always in its plans. The sixth squad of the police brigade was also able to fight and defeat the enemy, which was unexpected. This was because the squad leader Sun Mou had been in the military for a long time and was a graduate of the military academy, so he had this military merit. Sun had long regarded the Japanese army's attack as having no plan, and when faced with our army and police with vigorous morale, he expected its failure.

<p>Responsible and Did Not Leave When Japanese Soldiers Arrived at the Station</p>
<p>Reported News to Our Army by Telephone</p>
<p>Ten Japanese Soldiers Opened Fire but Miraculously Did Not Die</p>
<p>Rescued Only After Two Days and Nights</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Qichang, stationmaster of Tiantong'an Station on Songhu Road, was repeatedly killed by Japanese soldiers this time, but miraculously escaped. His life hung by a thread, and the danger was indescribable. Mr. Wang recounted his escape to the reporter of the Da Mei Evening News in the Red Cross Hospital, in great detail. Mr. Wang spoke in both Chinese and English. His first words were, "Because of my duties, I dare not leave my post." At 11:30 PM on Thursday, three Japanese tanks and over 200 marines suddenly rushed into Gate 7. It was found that they came from behind the Japanese headquarters station near the Japanese Garden. Mr. Wang immediately went to the duty room next door</p>
<p>to notify the Chinese military authorities at North Station by telephone, saying that the Japanese army was attacking. Wang firmly believed that since he was the only one in the station with the flagman and watchman, the Japanese army might not be watching. About fifteen minutes after the Japanese army attacked Zhabei, it was seen that more than 30 Japanese marines attacked into Gate 6, also near the station. They broke the door and rushed in. Wang and the flagman and watchman hid on one side. When the watchman saw the Japanese rushing in, ferocious and holding bayonets and rifles, he was very frightened and wanted to escape. Wang thought to himself that the watchman might escape, otherwise they would both die and be shot by the Japanese army. When the Japanese army escorted Wang and the flagman to the Japanese military camp, Wang did not see the Japanese soldiers chasing the watchman. When Wang and the flagman arrived within the Japanese army's range, a Japanese officer ordered them to go to the sandbag about ten feet away. When they reached the sandbag,</p>
<p>they were terrified. Upon closer inspection, it was seen that there were about 50 Japanese marines there. The Japanese officer ordered ten of them to come forward with their guns. Suddenly, the Japanese officer ordered them to raise their guns and aim, and shoot at them. The two men were terrified and could only cry out. The Japanese officer drew his command knife and shouted, and ten bullets were fired at Wang and the flagman. After it was over, Wang saw that the flagman was dead, but he was still alive, only his left arm was broken. How dangerous! Ten shots were fired at them, but they did not hit the vital point. Wang took the opportunity to escape to Zhabei, only walking about fifty feet. When he was about to leave the gate, he was captured by two marines. One of them quickly</p>
<p>shot Wang with his gun. At this time, his right arm was broken. The two marines thought they had hit a vital point, so they left him. Wang endured the pain and waited for a long time, then stood up and saw that his hands had no automatic function. He escaped towards Zhabei again. Not far ahead, he encountered a small stream and waded to the other side. At this time, blood gushed from the wound like a spring.</p>
<p>The small stream was all red. When he reached the shore, he saw a mud house, so he crawled in and rested for a while. This evening, he hid here. Until noon the next day, the Japanese plane dropped bombs and the mud house was burned. He endured the pain and moved forward, passing about two walls. Seeing that our army was fighting against the Japanese army, fortunately the soldiers were all fellow villagers, so Wang told them to go to the hospital quickly. At the same time,</p>

<p>he encountered a German who was going to Sichuan Road for business. The German, out of love, saw that all of Wang's clothes and shoes had been taken away by the Japanese, and he was only wearing a single pair of pants. He gave him one yuan and told him to hire a rickshaw to go to the Guangdong Hospital for treatment. Wang took this rickshaw through the gunfire, spending four hours searching for the hospital. When he arrived at the hospital, no one was there. He planned to return to North Station, but only reached the vicinity of the station when he saw our army fighting with the Japanese soldiers on Zhejiang Road. The soldiers saw him and advised him not to go forward. At this time, he did not know where to go, only wanting to leave Zhabei as soon as possible. He went to Xinzhapu Bridge to cross the river to his uncle's house. When he arrived at the river, there was no boat to cross. Fortunately,</p>
<p>two colleagues took him to the Puyi Blue Cross Hospital on Dagu Road. The doctor bandaged the wound, and he spent the night in the hospital. He saw countless wounded soldiers in the Puyi Hospital, all brave and inspired. Later, he was transferred to the Red Cross Hospital. He had not thought about food for days, only wanting to escape. He had endured pain and ran for two whole days and nights, with only thin pants on his body. If he had not been strong, he would have died long ago. Chinese and foreigners who heard Wang's words were all furious, hating the inhumanity of the Japanese army, and praising the courage of Wang and the soldiers at the front.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Japanese Army Destroys Concession Neutrality <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>A First in Concession History</p>
<p>Since the Japanese Marines blatantly disregarded everything on the 28th of last month and attempted to attack Zhabei in the Chinese territory, their advances and retreats have been based on the concessions to restrain our army's attacks. Since its establishment on November 17, 1843, the Public Concession has maintained its neutrality for eighty-nine years until this year, 1932. That is, during these eighty-nine years, in all international wars, whether between China and foreign countries, or between foreign countries, these foreign countries were important members related to the Public Concession. Each time, they were able to comply with the regulations and not exceed them regarding the neutrality of the Public Concession and the port of Shanghai. For example, during the Sino-French war in 1884-1885, the neutrality of the Shanghai port Public Concession was formally recognized first. After that, during the Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Sino-Russian War between 1904 and 1905, and the World War between 1914 and 1918, in all three international wars, no country related to the Shanghai Public Concession failed to recognize its neutrality and gave it absolute respect. However, this time, the Japanese army blatantly used the Public Concession as the starting point for its attack and as its base, repeatedly attacking the Chinese army. Its destruction of neutrality is a first in the history of the Public Concession. Therefore, the Japanese army's atrocities not only despise China, but also completely expose its contempt for all countries.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Overcrowded with Refugees <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Precautions Become More Comprehensive</p>
<p>After Mr. Feiwoli, Commissioner of Police of the French Concession, announced martial law at 10 PM last night, from 10 PM until dawn this morning, pedestrians disappeared. Only French Vietnamese soldiers and Chinese and Vietnamese patrolmen from the police department, as well as Chinese and foreign detectives from the general shift, armed and patrolled all night. After traffic resumed at dawn this morning, the tide of refugees traveling to the French Concession surged. The French army dispatched machine guns, tanks, etc., and were stationed at key passes at the boundary for protection.</p>

<p>Committed to Rescue, Propaganda, and Comfort</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Relief Association, in light of the increasingly serious situation due to the Shanghai Incident, Director Lin Kecong, in view of the urgency of the national crisis, resolutely dismissed his resignation and took charge of the association. He specially convened an emergency board meeting yesterday afternoon, and decided to convene a general meeting of members at Qingnian Middle School on Xiafei Road at 1:00 PM on the 3rd to assign duties and work, and sent letters to resigning directors Wang Xiaoying, Lu Huimin, etc., to come to the meeting immediately to discuss the progress together. It is heard that the current national salvation work will be divided into 1) rescue, 2) propaganda, and 3) comfort. They have prepared rush shoes, towels, and other items, and will be sent to the soldiers in the front this morning by the directors. At the same time, they have also divided into teams to be responsible for rescue and to visit and comfort the wounded soldiers in various hospitals every day. As for the propaganda materials, many types have also been printed and distributed to all sectors.</p>

<p>The case of You Bolu, the district head of the fifth district, was originally scheduled to be heard yesterday morning. Yesterday morning, all the lawyers reported in one after another. However, because none of the seventeen witnesses summoned by Judge Qian, who were all from the Zhabei area, had arrived, he ordered the trial to be postponed.</p>
