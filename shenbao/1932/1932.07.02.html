<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c1">再論「勦匪」與「造匪」 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>隔昨一評。吾人旣已引述勦匪將領之報告。與中央要員之談話。以證實平民之徒「匪」者日衆。與匪勢之日益張大。爲由於不良政治之所驅使矣。實則貪。官污吏與軍閥之魚肉人民。以及病民政治之茶毒。尙不止於此。政治之黑暗與人民疾苦之深重。其有非吾人想像所能及者。</p>
<p>中委居正氏曾談。「全國除浙粤魯外。其餘各省全種鴉片。種烟縣分。勒收烟苗捐逹數十萬至數百萬。」實則勒種之外。尙勒銷勒吸。又如上月二十七日汪精衛氏在中央紀念週演說云。「例如某某省政府不許人民種鴉片烟。賣鴉片烟。而他一人種獨賣鴉片烟。烟苗遍於全省。都是私人所有。及至鴉片太多了。便提練海洛英。這種鴉片公賣。不但亡國。簡直是滅種。」此鴉片之毒害人民間接則所以造「匪」也。</p>
<p>復如苛捐雜稅。在名義上政府雖已明令廢除。但按其實際。則有增無減。軍閥割據。各行其是。初非中央之統治力所能及。捐稅重重。花樣繁多。如四川田賦已預徵至民國三十年。捐稅更多至數十種。如廣東由連江運柴至廣州。護費重重。苛抽疊疊。柴船每艘捐輸逹五百元。空船返連。亦須二百元。就此一事。即可例其餘。如江西捐稅。亦逹十六七種之多。如湖南捐至無可再增。則又巧立名目。創立所謂「良民捐。」發「良民證。」以明其非「匪。」總之。此種情形。實遍全國。上自地方長官駐防軍隊。下迄圑防土劣。但求飽私囊。快私慾。决不惜掘土三尺。榨盡人民之血肉。一家歡笑。萬里號哭。此又苛政之茶毒人民間接即所以造「匪」也。</p>
<p>更如「部分「勦匪」軍隊。勦匪其名。而勦民其實。有「匪」之區。軍隊輒觀望不前。避道而行。避無可避。則全師而退。以槍資「匪。」如最近張貞所部之在漳州望風潰逃。陳調元所部四十六師之在合肥全部瓦解。即其例證。迨「匪」退却。始探望前進。每到一地。無辜農民。純良青年。每被指爲「匪」類。勒索罰欵。勒索不遂。即橫肆屠戮。則又以此謊報邀功。不曰俘斬若干。即曰收復某地不曰匪潰不成軍。即曰我軍追踪挺進。實則兵之擾民。尤甚於「匪。」民之畏兵。</p>
<p>亦甚於「匪。」兵到之處。不能撫輯流亡。安定秩序。甚且逃亡日衆。十室九空。所謂「匪梳兵　圑防剃。」實爲最眞實之喻言。此更軍隊之茶毒人民間接亦即所以造匪也。</p>
<p>政治黑暗如此。　　之氓。如淪地獄。是正即所謂「官逼民變。」官逼民變。民安得不變。旣逼民變。復從而圍勦。事之可悲。孰逾於此。吾人誠欲爲此萬千無辜橫死之同胞極口呼寃。</p>
<p>人禍之茶毒。旣已如此。而天災之慘重。則更慘絶人寰。前年西北大旱。去歲全國大水。江南河北。元氣未復。據五月二十二日國聞社鄭州電。「鹿邑拓城。春糧告竭。死亡枕籍。慘不忍覩。鹿邑朱愷店老鴉店寗平鎭澤平鎭桑園集。均立人市。年輕婦女人値十元。糼童僅値千文。孩提嬰兒。抛棄遍地。某家一家三口。五日内食洋車膠皮一付。某姓老婦六十日食麥稭一筐。僵斃飢民。即遭分食某婦買一饅頭。即以小姑爲質。」復如徐州災民所編这飢民歌有曰。「飽漢不知餓漢飢。稱貸無從祇呼天」「石粉樹皮並河草。枵腹取之渾下咽。」「逼到無法售兒女。相離臨去最辛酸。」凡此慘象。誠曠古罕見。是果爲人間耶。抑爲地獄耶。民荒如此。安得不亂。故無錫素稱富庶之地。鄉區竟於五月底六月上旬兩星期間。發生搶米風潮五十餘起。湖北漢川一帶。青苗樹皮。都已吃盡。民無以爲生。即多附「匪。」總之奮死求生。人之常情。災區即「匪」區。此又「匪」之所由生「匪」勢之所由日益張大也</p>
<p>政治如彼。民生如此。不改革政治。不安定民生。而欲以槍砲驅逐飢寒。剿滅爲飢寒迫使走險之良民。是果能有效耶。老子曰。「民不畏死。奈何何以死懼之。」實則民非不畏死。特旣遭飢寒之苦。更迫於槍砲之愭戮耳。嚮使革命而後。政治日即於清明。民生日即於安定。則吾人敢斷言「匪」决無由而生。「匪」勢更無由而日益張大。所以致今日「匪」。患濔漫全國者。咎究誰屬。政府諸公其一反思。</p>
<p>尤有進者。所謂「匪」者即擾害地方魚肉良民之意是則今日勒種鴉片公賣鴉片。勒收苛捐。搜刮民財者。迹其所爲。無一不積極「造匪。」「匪」而應剿。則此輩「造匪」者。固獨不應先爲剿滅乎。然而今日事實上。則「竊國者侯。竊鈎者誅。」此又吾人所大惑不解者也。</p>
<p>總之。政治如不清明。民生如不安定。則雖十次武力圍剿。亦必無功。此爲定理。絶無可疑。至於如何以澄清政治。如何以安定民生。容當續論之。</p>

<p>國民社三十日洛桑電　今日會議空氣雖仍充满希望、但自德國堅持切實解决賠欵問題、捨此以外、一槪拒絶考慮、而法英則欲索取一關於對美戰債之保障條文致造成僵局後、迄今仍無化除之象、今夜赫禮歐在啓程返巴黎前曾明白說明、謂德國雅不欲令會議因取消賠欵之補償數目而破裂、但必堅持承認協約國戰債與賠欵之連帶關係、再法國無論如何不能同意將賠欵問題、與軍縮問題或任何政治讓與相連鎖云云、法總理此語、殊未能表示今日談判曾獲得些微進步、按本日談判自晨迄於下午、聞主要議題、爲五債權國提出議案、規定德國最後付欵兩批、一爲十萬萬馬克、一批數目不定、大約在四十萬萬至七十萬萬馬克之間、前一批爲德國對於歐洲經濟善後基金之輸助、其他各國亦將有輸助、後一批則爲他日與美國談判戰債後美國所索尾找、應由德國代償之數、因此其數目尙難確定、惟德代表反對此計劃、聲稱、德國負債數目旣空泛不能確定、必致目前不定之局勢繼續延長、大足以减少會議之成就、現德人允提出對案、俾可折衷解决、但苟届時不克妥協、則下星期内會議之破裂、恐將無法避免矣、</p>

<p>國民社一日洛桑電　英相麥唐納與德總理巴本、曾於今晨會商解决賠欵新計劃、德財長格羅雪格亦與議、結果未悉、僅由德代表圑聲稱、總理巴本因亟欲表示德人抱其善意之明證、故與本會主席討論此計劃云云、至新計劃内容頃續有詳情洩出、即舊協約國方面亦尙有數點意見未能一致、據聞英國認五十萬萬馬克、已爲德國財力於停付五年之後再在長時期中陸續繳付之最大限度、法國仍堅持七十萬萬馬克、比國則反對其他數點、意代表雖於提出此計劃表示同意、但宣稱保留意見、所以今日一般人咸料即令德代表能同意於新計劃之原則、而欲根據此原則完全商妥、尙須幾費談判也、</p>

<p>在未寫本題之先、有幾句話先要聲明的、作者的家鄉、就在福建的閩南、現在寄寓鼓浪嶼、旅居南洋、快到二十年的光景了、這回看到赤匪先佔汀龍、繼陷漳州、而厦門泉州、也危在旦夕、再不急速救援、恐在不久的期間、福建全省要變成赤色的世界了、福建尤其是閩南、是南洋羣島·菲律濱羣島·｜英荷美法暹各屬地數百萬華僑的桑梓、誰無故鄉、誰無親族、誰無祖宗　墓、安忍坐觀其陸沉、目覩現在、追思過去、怵於將來、甚冀我數百萬閩僑、稽其癥結所在、共起救之、則又幸矣、</p>
<p>現在的閩西閩南·被赤軍佔隊之後、已成立了所謂蘇維埃的政府、實施牠破壞的手段、燒殺搶刧擄掠姦淫、没收私人產業、燬滅契約的種種慘劇、也已一幕一幕地演去了、汀漳龍的民衆、遭受着家破人亡流離失所的痛苦、也都一件一件地嘗過了、現在難民避到厦門的已逹二十萬人、鼓浪嶼雖設有難民收容所、但杯水車薪、無濟於事、厦門一般資本家、現在還是各人自掃門前雪、最近才有基督敎青年會繼起創設一所收容的地方、但只限定收容三百人、其餘大部份的難民、還是露宿風餐、狀若喪家之犬、這種悽慘的情景、還是方興未艾、赤禍的空間、正在日日擴大著、時間也繼續延長著、泉州厦門的人心、也惶恐不可終日、民衆呼救的哀音、已力竭聲嘶、各方雖有派援軍的消息、總是空雷無雨、最初粤軍也曾一度開到閩邊、後來因爲海空軍歸併的問題、内部起了爭奪、已再將軍隊調了回去、桂軍入閩、也在千呼萬喚還没聽到動員的消息、可憐福建民衆、在這水深火烈之中、哀號打滚著待死、數百萬的華僑家山、勢將陸沉、家產已見破碎、親族快就死滅了、遠居海外的人、眼巴巴看著這樣的慘情、自救無方、呼籲不靈、心如利刃　絞、欲哭無涙、黨國諸公、聲聲句句稱華僑爲革命之母、招徠華僑歸國興辦實業、尤爲政府之政策、今竟坐令華僑的故鄉破碎到這種田地、兹惟有希望我們閩人、尤其是我海外數百萬的閩僑、對今後應該怎樣纔能够救家鄉、好像醫生的治病、先要把病源弄個明白、然後對症下藥、纔有起死回生的希望、</p>
<p>福建今日的赤禍、勢成燎原、那直接來播種造因的、是土匪變相的各駐軍部像從前的高義·郭鳳鳴·吳威·楊漢烈等、現在的盧興邦·林壽國·陳國輝·林忠·及號稱國軍四十九師張貞的部隊、間接的是　頇無能的海軍系的福建省政府、而前此中央的當局、也要同負這種的責任、我現在把這問題推討一下、</p>
<p>（一）福建各部駐軍是赤匪的造因者</p>
<p>北伐軍自閩省出發之後、留了一個譚曙卿在閩、收編一切平素爲民衆所切齒的土匪、稱曰新編第一軍、那時候的高義·吳威·盧興邦·郭鳳鳴·陳國輝·高爲楊漢烈·葉定國·汪漢民·尤賜福等、都是當時的師長旅長圑長、閩人因不堪其摧殘剝削、羣起反對、奔走呼號、乃於民十六年冬、得十一軍（即現在的十九路軍）閩、把新編軍的暴力解决、當時高義楊漢烈（時吳威已死部隊歸高義）等部駐省固已盡被繳械、尙有葉定國一部、由仙欲竄回同安老巢、中途却被湖洋民衆全部繳械、陳國輝事先調駐龍巖、郭鳳鳴由泉屬竄回汀州永定、惜未能一網打盡、不到兩個月的時間、十一軍回粤、泉州漳州遂由海軍陸戰隊塡防、又不久、張貞部隊、也從浙江的江山縣回閩、海軍把漳州的防地讓給張貞、初時閩南的人民、對張貞</p>
<p>的回閩、抱著一種熱烈的希望、希望牠能夠繼續十一軍澈底清匪的工作、不料牠抵漳之後、大反民衆的希望、盡最收編大小股的土匪來擴充自已的勢力、民衆雖激烈地反對、牠竟一意孤行、槪置不顧、苛捐雜稅、又復增加、因此漳州的人民、就有一篇的歌謠說、『張毅換張貞、雜捐加二升、不顧民疾苦、專收土匪兵、』這已足見民心的向背、泉永各縣、仍由海軍陸戰隊第二旅林壽國部駐紥著、爭編了著匪汪連明·高爲國、縰容牠肆橫勒派、刧掠焚殺、晋·南·惠·各縣的民衆、都水深火烈、而牠則坐地分贓、同時陳國輝在龍巖、郭鳳鳴在汀州永定、更極敲剝殘殺之能事、龍汀民衆稍加反對者、迭遭殺害、當時龍岩縣黨部委員謝寳萱·指委陳雪琴·和汀州黨部委員某（忘其姓名）、皆以反對陳郭而遭慘殺、因此閩西一帶、凡屬智識階級的青年都不能立足、一大部分投入於共產黨、眞所謂「爲淵驅魚、爲叢逐雀、」於是民十七閩西赤禍起矣、郭鳳鳴本身也葬喪於自已新挖的墳墓、全部消滅於赤軍之手、赤軍又乘勢進攻龍巖的陳國輝、這次陳部了受了很大損失、不過那時候赤軍的勢力、還不大雄厚、暫時平息下去、陳國輝受了這次敎訓後、不但没有悔悟、愈益暴戾恣睢、遂激成民十八春夏間赤軍第二度進攻龍岩、陳國輝這回幾乎也全部消滅、逃到同安集中、只剩三四百的殘餘、本身也險些被殺、龍岩就此失陷、閩西一帶、使變成赤化的世界了、接著省政府有勦陳的命令、馴至盧興邦拘綁省府委員的事件發生、陳匪遂再由方聲濤來收編、給以省防軍的名義、未幾進駐泉州永春各縣、儼然獨當一面、又和張貞沆瀣一氣、肆無忌憚、大敲特剝、去年冬竟變本加厲、明目張膽、公然迫種烟苗、征抽烟苗捐、計張貞在漳屬各縣及同安實收七八百萬元、陳國輝在泉永也實收六七百萬元、而開辦的經費和承包人的中飽在外、若合攏起來計算、總不下二千萬元、試問漳泉永各縣旣年年被牠們敲脂剝髓、已至民窮財盡、不能聊生、那堪再受這種極度無厭的榨取、現在張陳兩部分的軍官自營長以上所積的民脂民膏、個個有數十萬至數百萬的家財、因此也引起赤匪的覬　、便大舉來犯、此時張部的軍官、爲保全牠們的身家財產、聞風先逃、牠們在退出漳州的时候、用大批的挑夫、來搬運烟土和現金、而軍用最需要的槍砲子彈、竟付之一炬、漳州旣陷、牠所受的重創、却是罪有應得的、但漳龍的民衆慘</p>
<p>遭蹂躪、眞是百身莫贖的罪惡啊、總而言之、若没有郭鳳鳴陳國輝的殘暴敲削、就没有閩西的赤禍、没有張貞的玩法貪婪、就没有現在漳州的慘局、所以我說福建</p>
<p>赤禍的造因者、就是這些土匪變相的各部駐軍、是絲毫不曾寃枉們的、（未完）</p>

<p>說記錄一紙、上述被認爲反動言論、皆未删去、惟意義較婉轉、理論較深切、邏輯較周詳、夏氏接函後、當即復函准予辭職、略謂「吾兄因言詞誤會、亟欲遠引高　、具微養氣功深、欽佩曷極、重遵來意、　開去湖北省政設計委員會委員職務」云云、今日（三十）晨、蔣委員長閱報、得知此事情形、大爲震怒、當致電話省府、着將韓玉宸看管嚴辦、省府秘書長楊在春、下午一時接電話後、當即渡江與何成濬一度商洽、復回武昌、於傍晚時、將韓拘捕、聽候發落、</p>

<h3 id="c79">東北之謎Ｋ <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>（三）新大陸造成上最大必要之關鍵　　（一）和德法兩國面積加起來差不多大的東北、不到三天、大部份就被日本軍隊占領了、這樣的容易、自然原因很多、但是交通機關、尤其是鐵路、早把持在日本人手内、不能不承認是一個最有關係的事實、所以要研究東北問題、必須拿鐵路來做骨幹、</p>
<p>用經濟手段滅亡人國、最是殺人不見血的妙法、今日的南满鐵道會社、豈不是從前東印度公司的化身、二十五年來、南满鐵道會社的勢力、在東北已經根深蒂固了、满蒙新五路、就是從這條幹線上生出來的枝葉、日本人天天在那裏希望開花結果、實現所謂「明治大帝第三期的計畫」、由滅亡满蒙而征服中國、由滅亡中國而征服亞洲與全世界、</p>
<p>（二）從「南满之國」一語、可以想見南满鐵道會社事業範圍的宏大、除本身業務以外、採礦、鍊鐵·製油·築港·造船·堆棧·旅館·航業·　業·電汽·煤汽·以至地質調查·農業試騐·獸疫研究·市街經營·衛生·敎育·警備·水道·產業·商工諸種設施、幾乎無所不包、從組織上說、日本人能控制東北、與其謂爲軍人和浪人的成功、無　謂爲南满鐵道會社的成功、較爲適當、</p>
<p>南满鐵道會社的目的、現已大部份逹到、但爲進一步擴張其事業的範圍、决計增加資本三億六千萬元而成爲八億元、今年十月、先收二千萬元、以爲新定事業的用途、餘則視需要的緩急、分十年或十年募足、</p>
<p>南满鐵道會社新定的事業、已經宣布的、有下列幾種、</p>
<p>（一）爲開發满蒙、由該會社之經濟委員會、與日本政府合作、爲满蒙資源之經濟調查、</p>
<p>（二）爲避免世人耳目、將該會社之附屬事業及各旁系會社、如南满洲瓦斯株式會社·南满洲電汽株式會社·大連　業株式會社·南满洲旅館株式會社·满洲船渠株式會社·撫順炭販賣株式會社·大連汽船株式會社·福昌華工株式會社等、另組一特殊會社、使之獨立、</p>
<p>（三）爲振興满蒙對日貿易、除錦州·吉林·敦化·哈爾濱·三姓·齊齊哈爾·寧安七處、已設有貿易館外、决在扶餘洮南等地、添設貿易館外、</p>
<p>日本政府、仿吞併朝鮮前例、儗設立满洲總監、以統一東北的政權、所以從前賦與南满鐵道會社政治上種種使利、不得不大加削弱、而改爲純粹商業的機關、該社總裁内田康哉、已被任爲外務省大臣、大約此種計畫、不久即須實現、而内田主張承認傀儡國最力、又是吾人所應該注意的、</p>
<p>（三）九一八事變以後、關於鐵路方面、日人首先接收東北交通委員會、令丁鑑修爲委員長、各路職員如有去職的、即日人補充之、否則即加派日籍職員、初稱參事、後覺無所根據、乃改用顧問「囑託」式聯絡員名義、事無大小、無不干與、後來僞交通部成立、仍令丁爲僞部長、東北交通委員會、即於三月二十五日取消、</p>
<p>僞交通部設總務·鐵道·郵務·水運四司、總務司長爲大近幸男、鐵道司長爲森田成之、郵務司長爲藤田保明、大幸近男係南满路長春站長、部務全操在日人手内、可想而知、</p>
<p>僞鐵道司分庶務·路工·經理·及第一至第五八科、第一科管吉長·吉敦·吉海三路、第二科管四洮·洮昂·齊克三路、第三科管奉山·藩海·二路、第四科管呼海路、第五科管中東路、組織極爲奇特、</p>
<p>僞交通部成立後、曾於五月一日、舉行所謂「全國鐵道會議、」所討論的問題、大略如下、</p>
<p>（一）奉山·瀋海·吉海·吉敦·吉長·中東·洮昂·四洮·齊克各路聯運辦法之改良、及行車時刻之劃一、</p>
<p>（二）整頓各站候車室、乃增加一切設備、</p>
<p>（三）改良各站旅館飯店及車内販賣部、</p>
<p>（四）擴充護路守備隊、及增加隨車保護之路警、</p>
<p>（五）整理各列車内之座位、並注意車内衛生、</p>
<p>（六）取締路員及脚行、不准欺騙旅客及額外需索、</p>
<p>日人爲防義勇軍及鬍匪的襲擊、規定鐵路區域内、不準照相、鐵路兩旁」千六百尺内、不準播種高梁包米等高大値物、　雜人等、不準在月台上逗留、從前各路提倡値樹、開車一望、青碧交蔭、今日人恐義勇軍或鬍匪藏匿其中、砍伐殆盡、頓成满目荒凉、可謂大煞風景、</p>
<p>日人爲澈底把持路務、除調用南满鐵路養成所學生外、另設車務傳習所、訓練低級路員、警官學校、訓練護路領袖、又因各路行車電報、現皆改用日文、特設音響機傳習所、訓練各站司報、講師皆由南满鐵道會社代聘、薪金極高、東北路務之完全成爲日本化、又可拭目以待、</p>
<p>東北各路、爲輔助敎育、向代征敎育附捐、又爲提倡殖邊、訂有移民乘車減價及農具運送免費等章程、今皆爲日人取消、由此可見日人只實行其應有的政策、他人的利益、皆所不顧、（未完）</p>

<p>— 不除庭草齋夫</p>
<p>四十四朱先生這樣怱忙的進城去、究竟是爲什麽？這是頗費猜想的。我却深信朱先生是一定要回來。他没有帶小弟弟一同進城，他能不回來嗎？</p>
<p>果然央夕陽的紅光中，朱先生是回來了，我們喜出望外。朱先生還有一位朋友與他同來。經他介紹，我們知知道這位朋友是一位退職的軍官。</p>
<p>朱先生說：『鐘兒！你到村莊裏去挨家打個招呼，說說我有個好法子防備土匪，凡是家裏有槍的，一聽見鐘聲就聲就請背槍來開會。』這是多麽好的一個消息啊！村等不及我敲鐘，也没有吃晚飯都蜂擁而來了。有槍的固然是糾糾的來了，没有槍的也來凑熱閙。我說錯了，他們們並不是來凑熱閙，乃是急要知道如何可以防備土匪！我其我其實是不必敲鐘召集，因爲鐘未敲大家是已經到齊了。但但是我必得如約而敲。奇怪！今晚的鐘聲是特别的宏亮，，令人聽了，不禁增加勇氣百倍。</p>
<p>大殿容不下，只得在古廟前面空塲上集合。朱先生說說：『我對於逼上梁山的好漢，是有相當的同情。但是做强做强盗也要有個道理。殺小孩子的强盗便是無道之盗。小小孩子是我們的上帝，殺小孩子的强盗，我們必須與他奮　。强盗也許今天晚上就來！他們要綁的孩子也許就是是你抱在手上的小寳寳。只有一個法子能呌强盗不敢來。有槍的聯合起來服從一個總指揮學位緊急戰！我請了我的的朋友江營長來敎你們。我們不要學立正開步走向後轉一類的武八股。江營長要敎你們的是在打仗上學打仗。假假使今天晚十點鐘就有强盗來綁我們的孩子，或是有帝國主義者來挖我們祖宗的　墓奪我們大好的山河，我們在這在這三四個鐘頭内應該如何學法才能以一當百的去抵抗？好，我們便在打倒强盗上去學打倒帝國主義。現在請江營營長指救。』</p>
<p>江營長：『我不願敎武八股，也不願說客套話。還有四個鐘頭强盗就要來了，怎麽辦？（一）打起火把來學學打靶子。每人先學瞄準輪流打三粒子彈。如果子彈少，打一粒也可。（二）學裝槍拆槍。（三）學緊急集合。（四）有槍的分兩隊，一隊裝强盗，一隊裝自衞圑學攻守野戰。』</p>
<p>江營長說了即刻打起火把幹。當夜四項學畢後，即分分配輪流守夜。口令是岳飛二字，不知道口令不能通過。。於是全村進入戒嚴狀態。壯丁個個變成大無長的戰士，，從前那種驚心吊膽的恐怖心理早已烟消雲散了。</p>

<p>曾得兩次全國錦標而今威風安在</p>
<p>今有慧星出現體協會宜極力贊助</p>
<p>上海爲我國體育之中心、各種運動、均有特殊之精神與濃厚之興趣、厥惟棒球運動、乏人提倡、無人練習、每况愈下、大有消滅之勢、推原其故、良以經濟缺乏、人才稀少、而負提倡之責者、亦淡然視之、不事鼓勵、去過數年、偶有省數人赴中華棒球塲練習、卒因球藝糼稚、奬掖乏人、致於消聲匿跡、</p>
<p>回憶過去之上海棒球界、不無相當成績、民國十五年曾舉行全國分區棒球錦標比賽、當時在華南隊因事未能出席、僅由華北與華東兩隊、因滬競奪冠軍、結果華東連勝兩塲、奪得冠軍、自此滬地棒球興趣、日見濃郁、民衆方面、亦逐漸注意、每次比賽、觀者漸多、提倡者旣具熱忱、賽員亦愈覺興奮、棒球運動、遂見蓬動氣象矣、</p>
<p>民國十七年夏、上海組織中華棒球隊、羅致人才、努力訓練、球藝進步、更非昔比、乃參加上海西人棒球聯合比賽、共五隊參戰、中華隊雖未能敵麥令斯之雷賽斯及派尼斯兩隊、然每次比賽之勝負、常在一二分之差、且能戰勝威名素著之業餘隊及海軍隊、名列第三、比賽之期、轟動滬上、觀者踴躍、比外復有初級棒球聯賽之舉行、有中華乙、猶太隊、美國公學隊、滬江及約翰與同文等校參加、是爲棒球界最興盛之時、</p>
<p>是年中華棒球隊除參加上海棒球聯合賽外、並於八月底率師南下、赴香港與全國棒球鼻祖、華南隊作全國分區棒球錦標賽、當時後起之上海棒球隊、竟一鳴驚人、所向無敵、與華南之第一次賽、成三比三和局、因天晚未能結束、第二次華南以五比四勝、第三次上海以五比零勝、第四次上海又以九比五勝、於是榮膺冠軍、重掌全國棒球盟主、在港又與各西人强隊比賽、上海每戰皆捷、大勝凱旋、</p>
<p>上海棒球、正在頭角初露、鋒芒漸盛之時、前途希望、以爲無窮、不料時過境遷、形勢日非、翌年人才星散、實力大遜、雖當有少數熱心份子、登高内喊但響應無人、以致漸趨不景氣之狀態矣、</p>
<p>民十九、依然無新興氣象、體育協進會亦漸漸冷淡、不事振興、去年上海棒球界之功臣張國勛黎寳駿劉逹成輩、大聲疾呼、蓄意整頓、並鑒於棒球界無穏固之圑體組織、不足謀事業之發逹、遂發起組織上海中華棒球會、藉以分隊練習、促進技俩、當時加入者有五六十人、在四川路中國青年會開成立大會、精神頗見踴躍、但爲時不久、卽無形消滅、更無成績之可言、满腔熱血化爲鳥有、</p>
<p>如上所述、上海棒球界之盛極而衰、誠令人不勝今昔之感矣、上海之熱心棒球者、各大學之體育指導、以及體育恊進會、將何以自慰而慰人歟、</p>
<p>荏苒光陰、跑馬廳之鑽塲上、又已充分狂熱之人氣矣、我國將如何、中華棒球塲綠苬如蓋、無人光臨、寜不可惜、體育恊進會至少應負相當責任、</p>
<p>當此慘淡冷落之華人棒球界中、今忽有二位慧星出現、胸懷大志、蓄意欲振興上海棒球、希望體育恊進會以及其他熱心棒球者、努力贊助、共襄進行、</p>
<p>其人爲何、卽橫濱中華體育會華僑梁扶初與梁澄松二君、此次因暴日侵華、憤而返國、現居上海、擬集合棒球同志、重組中華棒球隊、以事提倡、梁扶初君、年近四十、爲前橫濱中華棒球隊監督兼接手、梁澄松則爲二壘員及中塲、均精於此道、熱心此道者、</p>
<p>兩梁將聯絡海上名將如張國助黎寳駿等、召集　將、組織球隊、從事訓練、此誠上海華人棒球界之一線曙光、梁望熱心志士、響應而起、爲暮氣沉沉之體育界、奄奄一息之棒球界、如旭日之東昇、放出艷麗燦爛之光輝、誠不勝韾香禱祝之矣、</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>人怕出名猪怕壯，這是一句老話。其實呢，不但，人怕出名，地也怕出名：素來不大著名的地方，忽的轟轟烈烈的熱閙起來，這地方一定是做了戰區！在這最近幾年内，北方的長辛店，南方的黃渡，以及抗日最烈的廟行，都在報紙上出過風頭；然而，地在那裏出風頭，人在那裏吃苦頭了！</p>
<p>長辛苦做戰區，黃渡做戰區，這都是歷史上的污點；惟有，廟行作戰，是對外的戰爭，是保全民族的戰爭，歷史上負有相當的榮譽。</p>
<p>零仃洋，零仃洋，這名詞雖然不大表表於世；但在南宋的歷史上，卻也有一種亘古不滅的紀念。</p>
<p>人生自古誰無死，留取丹心照汗青。｜這不是文天祥經過零仃洋的詩句麽？文天祥秉着這顆丹心，要恢復大宋江山；他的戰爭，是對外的戰爭，是保全民族的戰爭；這兩句糠慨激昂的詩，替零仃洋生色不少。</p>
<p>現在呢，零仃洋中又閙起戰爭來了。把我們中華民國的飛機，去轟炸我們中華民國的戰艦！戰艦上也把我們中華民國的高射砲，去射擊我們中華民國的飛機！中國的海陸空，只有陸軍可用：其他呢，海不成軍，空也不成軍。救國青年呐喊着擴充海軍，擴充空軍，萬不料這一些些二點點空海二軍，還要玩這一套頑意兒，玩到同歸於盡，才肯罷休！</p>
<p>零仃洋中的水鳴咽地說：文天祥給我們的榮譽，都被這猛烈的砲火炸彈轟掉了。</p>

<p>— 碧城</p>
<p>報載廬山會議時。蔣在山訓話。謂今後應改變心理。效法曾左彭等治事精神。挽回風氣。以謀振作。國病已至危殆之日。開出這張方子。當然是對症的良方。但是社會上有句話。『說眞方。賣假藥。』藥一假。方子雖對。吃了下去。依然不能起死回生。是良方尙可求到。所慮良藥未易收得耳。鄙人姑把良藥的地道。略說一番。或不嫌辭費乎。吾人須先知古昔賢傑之治事精神。何自而來。並非全賴天賦之才質。蓋養成之有素也。讀古人書。講明大義。此其一。入有賢父兄之敎督。出有良師友之切　。此其二。一切聲色貨利。足以蠱惑我。陷溺我者。視如毒蛇猛虎。避之惟恐不速。此其三。有此三者之充分修養。一旦出而治事。精神自然十分十二分充足振奮。爲其一心一志於國與民之公。而無絲毫私慾之念累之也。具此正氣。感化力當然彊大。將佐僚屬。咸自鼓勵。文官不要錢。武官不惜死之風氣。由是成矣。曾左彭之學問。一言以蔽之。皆從刻苦做成。曾公常謂學問須看勝我者。境地須看不如我者。官京朝日。得力　倭艮峰馮樹堂等一班學道之儒。一言一動。均於日記記出。歸於不欺其心。痛自刻厲。（見曾文正公家書）曾公保奏左公也。稱之爲剛明耐苦。曉暢戎機。奏保彭公也。稱之爲堅苦卓絶。有古烈士風。（均見曾文正公大事記）左公婚後。食於外家。未幾即力求自立。其自撰周夫人墓志。有云。恥不能自食。乞外姑西頭屋。别　以居。（見所著盾鼻餘瀋）彭公之父。爲浙江某縣巡檢。積廉俸託所親買田衡陽。父卒。所親吞没其田。時公尙少年。思有以報。太夫人勸止之。而勉以刻苦自立。（見盾鼻餘瀋彭母王夫人家傳）略舉數端。知皆從刻苦中鍜鍊而成者也。夫藥之良者。產自山中。多歷年所。根深氣厚。採而用之。自然靈效。今世之藥。大半栽於淺土。糞使速成。觀之光澤甚美。或且認爲勝於山中積年始成之材。及至用以治病。乃始致歏於無效。而病已不可爲矣。我近來觀於世事。往往念及說眞方賣假藥兩語。而喟然太息。政府諸公。諒亦歷試假藥而知其弊。今後覺悟。儻可必乎。</p>

<p>白天裏看不見满裝着舗蓋的馬車，黑夜裏也聽不見掠空浩吼的殺人的巨聲，一種充满着恐怖和騷擾的都市之音樂與圖畫，不復映入了每一個人底眼，也不復撥動了每一個人底心。而一切都復歸於平靜的上海，把血洗乾，把淚吞盡，即使閘北的斷堞殘垣，吳淞的荒野瓦礫，也被隔絶在另一個世紀裏，所有神秘之術的銀色咖啡座上，也已坐满了青春的驕傲者，在月光像乳油般流動的人行道間，也已增多了皮靴的聲音和一對一對的黑影。</p>
<p>斜陽晼晼的黃昏的草香裏，那曾經被木屐踏過的公園的綠茵上，也留戀着中國的少年紳士和肉做的小姐，他們是那樣地眼看着眼，嘴碰着嘴：落葉飛下來，怎能驚動了他們桃色的夢？</p>
<p>在夜色包圍住的白屋子裏，從銀幕的反映光中，也攢動着黑髮的頭顱，和游戲塲的歌聲，一般有着領略的大批主顧。馬路上的汽車，商店裏的洋錢，以至東方書塲，也恢復了一二八前的狀態了。</p>
<p>於是，我們不得不感謝上海停戰協定給我們的那麽重大的安適，和自私的每種習慣了的快感？</p>
<p>戰爭的惡魔逃走，繼着便是我們優待自已的找覓好運命。好一個「好運命」，它又要把我們帶進一個永遠幽深的夢裏，而再期待着因爲不能自救所以被人欺侮的另一個戰爭的來臨！</p>

<h3 id="c103">疫癘之預防 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>

<p>梅雨溜　，新苔上壁。時維仲夏。而海上以疫癘聞矣。蓋自淞滬戰後。死亡枕籍。老子云。「大軍之後。必有凶年。」誠以兵凶戰危。積屍旣多。而疫癘即由此發生焉。如清季髮匪亂後。江浙諸省。時疫甚烈。前年湖南亂後。亦發生疫癘。死亡載道。誠浩刦也。曾國藩金陵湘軍昭忠祠記有云。「我軍薄雨花臺。未幾。疾疫大作。兄病而弟染。朝笑而夕僵。一夫旣死。數人送葬。比其返。而半殕於途。：：」今海上以戰禍之後。疫癘之發生甚早。蓋亦自然之理也。際兹仲夏之時。寒燠不正。天氣潮濕。最宜病菌之蕃殖。一旦傳播迅速。其禍不亞於兵燹。哀我細民。浩刦未已。尤大可殷憂者也。海上慈善圑體林立。掩埋屍體·消毒·防疫等事。固非異人任。若送打防疫針。施藥送診等。亦急宜舉行。夫國人方汲汲於戰禍之幸免。而不注意於疫癘之洊至。豈不可危。預防之法無它。注射霍亂血清而已。又時食大蒜。亦有預防之效。清潔飲食。運動身體。不入菜館及游戲場。勿露宿星月之下。勤沐浴。常灑掃。隔離病人。消毒器物。凡此皆淺近之常識。而實預防疫癘之良方也。（按患時疫之人。急宜送醫院診治。若鹽水注射等。皆有特效。坊間盛行之各種十滴水。萬不能治眞性霍亂也。又蠅類爲傳播病菌之唯一媒介物。故食品必須蓋藏。勿使蠅類飛集。又隔宿腐敗物。亦不宜食。）</p>

<p>據說印度馬得里地有一個婦人。是一個印度織布工人的妻子。今年三十歲。伊已經有十三年不吃一滴水一碗飯了。所以社會的人士。對於伊都是非常注意。而且伊雖然十三年不吃茶飯。伊的身體。人家看起來却非常健康。并且還養過三個孩子咧。伊的歷史。的確可以編一册有趣味的故事。而當地的長官。最近也曾去訪問過伊。據說有一次伊從丈夫的家裏。回到伊的娘家去。但走到中途。伊忽然倒下來昏厥了。後來就送到醫院裏去。在醫院裏。伊住了兩星期之久。才回家去。那時醫生用盡了種種方法。使伊開口。使伊說話。使伊吃東西。但完全無效。而且伊的身體。却依然健康。伊究竟爲什麽而暈厥和不開口。醫生委實没有法子知道。祇好送伊回去。但經過了二年之久。有一天伊忽然開口講話了。現在伊在家裏帮助丈夫料理家事。但伊仍不吃東西</p>

<p>第十一回　偏枯小邑瞻仰牙旌　獧瑣羣流呵從騶　　　可是閒中就想起這奉派的任務。要怎樣才能辦成。如今拿着這一紙空文。竟是渺渺茫茫。毫無頭緒。不知從何處着手呢。安玉田看看要急得没有辦法。誰知還是梁笑雲預料得不差。只要騙得着名義。總會有一般攀龍附鳳的人們。找上門來捧塲獻策。在這些投效人中。最得力的一個。是平常替他夫婦開車的汽車夫劉運材。服務在汽車行裏。平日認識軍政界的好主顧得多。胡諮議式德也坐過他的車。因此知道兩方所辦的事是地點相同。特介紹鄔進祿來與安玉田合作。他二人一見面。一個如魚得水。一個如虎添翼。就談得極投機。鄔進祿足智多謀。替安玉田籌畫。可以到海定縣去着手。有他做輔弼和嚮導。招撫多少人是極其容易。安玉田那時。除了倚靠鄔進祿别無他法。自然樂於允從。便留下梁笑雲在省城旅館裏。親同胡式德鄔進祿等人起早到這海定縣來。一行人衆中。只有胡式德是另有要公。隨帶一名僕役。别成一系。其餘便全都是安玉田的手下人。旅館賬房荐了個親戚朱啓鴻。跟來預備做軍需長。汽車夫劉運材也有志改行。候補了副官長。另又花錢買了兩枝匣槍。將茶房伍世海和舊僕王定等。帶來改扮成武裝馬弁。似排戲一般預先演習好。呌他們都稱呼安玉田做安司令。鄔進祿居中操縱。將安胡二方面聯成一片。又主持一切事宜。儼然就是個參謀長的身分。當晚住在這長興大旅館。直睡到第二天午刻才一齊起床。忽然秦掌櫃匆匆跑進來找鄔進祿報告道。四爺。今早出了一件奇事。李知事在昨夜棄官潛逃了。欲知此人因何逃跑。下回再見分解。</p>

<p>吳市長致訓詞略謂上海爲全國經濟中心、各國觀瞻所繫、地位重要、成爲凡百事業活動之重心、故本市商會之地位、實居全國商業集圑之領導、吾人試觀察目前國内現象、政治社會、經濟民生、無一而非形成中國前途趨於極危險之境界、吾國號稱地大物博之國家、而現今反至民窮財盡、存亡莫卜之地步、究其　結所在、無非爲政治不安定、全國各種事業、不獲自由發展、以致人民生計、交受政治及意外壓迫之苦痛、所以我人欲解决全民生活之安全、實非努力發展國民經濟、從事倡興各地工商事業不可、不過一國之内、僅恃工業生產、不與商業合作運動、鮮有不歸失敗之理、向來吾國企業失敗、大都由於資金之不集中、譬如有人創辦工廠、除精研於製造之外、又須分心致力於資金之籌運、出品之推銷、故國内工業界之困難、通常實因資本不流動、出品囤積、爲其最大原因、苟各地商業機關、於其所屬分子、能夠引導得宜、使工商業互相得其調劑、則上述困難、自然可以消釋、吾人欲謀社會安定、第一要使國民經濟滋潤、國民經濟之原動力、則又仰賴於工業之發展、工業之能獲得發展、則又非商業儘力予以扶助提倡不爲功、本日爲本市商會新職員就職之日、諸君對於本市工商業之復興、均負有重大使命、鐵城貢獻以上一些意見、甚願與諸君共謀推進携手合作、繼由、</p>
<p>黨部代表致詞略謂、今日爲市商會第二届新職員宣誓就職之日、諸君之當選爲商會委員、可謂由於全市商人所推崇、此後努力商運、謀工商事業之發展、兄弟今日謹以熱誠願祝前途成功、吾人知道、向來商人有句所謂在商言商的話、但此種說法、并非爲壞話、盡工商業爲一國經濟之發動機、工商業能獲發展、國家之經濟卽得能充實其力量、鞏固國家之地位、不過於此外每日亟、國内政治尙未入軌、國民經濟凋疲、社會犾態不安穏之下、商人除本身責任之外、應站在民衆地位上、求民族之自由平等、因爲工商業經濟、在國民經濟上、不過居其一部分、吾人獻身社會、自應同時求整個之解决、爲國家盡其責任、查現行商會選任制度、每满相當時期、舉行新舊交替一次、如此人才輪流交換、事業仍著其舊　將來結果之美满自在意中、希望諸君努力、</p>
<p>社會局致訓詞上海爲國内經濟重心、亦爲世界經濟之重要區域、本市商會、係於二年前依據中央法令正式組織成立、中間分子、如各同業公會、并均屬健全圑體、在最近之過去、曾經扶助政府維持地方秩序、以及種種重大工作、實有相當勞績、此吾人應引爲値得稱贊之點、惟此次地方猝遭變故之後、元氣大損、所有此後工商業應如何調劑、恢復繁榮、種種設施、有待妥籌規劃、今日市商會舊委員告退、新委員接任、同時宣誓就職、其所負責任、實較過往尤爲重大、希望加倍努力、</p>
<p>司令代表致詞　今日兄弟參加市商會新委員就職典禮、覺得有點感想、人家說地大物博的中國、何以不能富强呢、不知這個原因、因爲政治不良與經濟凋枯所致、一個國家、欲圖强盛、第一對外要有政治力量、政治力量不足、則以經濟力量來補充、苟兩者俱有準備、則國家地位、卽可安然維持過去、我國之所以不能同躋於國際平等地位、反受列强的凌欺、也無非没曾完備這二種力量、向來吾人對於對外力量、覺得物質及不來人家富足、槍砲比不上人家來得銳利、早已如卵投石、成爲勝敗必然之勢、經濟方面、則每年漏巵數萬萬、徒覺補塞無方、自從這次十九路軍、開始以政治力量向暴日抵抗之後、似乎已予吾人相當覺悟、但是政治力量之運用、還得以經濟力量爲其基礎、世界任何事物之變故、莫不以經濟爲其背景、爲其原動力、惟經濟足以轉移一切、欲謀救國、亦非充分經濟之力量不可、剛才吳市長所云努力發展工商事業、以充實國家之經濟力量、實爲當今急務、希望諸君、與政府合作、予政府以民衆力量、爲其禦外之後盾、</p>
<p>林康侯氏演說　兄弟於民十六、曾經担任本市商會職務、故於本市之商情、亦略有領會、但時至今日、上海工商業之情况、凋敝恐慌、可謂逹於極點、記得從前商人圑體、一方面因自已組織並未健全、所以向來亦不談政治、後來却覺得政治不上軌道、無論何事、總不容易辦好、於是才開始傾問政治問題、可是數年以來、政治上的五花八門、依然在各顯神通、結果、還是爭持不息、所以我人欲謀凡百事業之出路、應先　國内政治之安定、故最近兄弟倡議之廢止内戰運動、實爲吾人最重要之工作、雖然向來發生内戰之時、人民總有一番　籲和平、但是各别進行、終鮮成效、故此次吾人從事倡行廢止内戰、自須聯絡各方、並須先行鞏固本身集圑之組織、不自發生内爭、採用種種有效之和平方案、去完成這個任務、所以連帶者望商會或分會方面、萬勿引起内爭、則以後任何事　、都易於合作、這是兄弟一些意恩</p>
<p>王介安氏演詞此次滬戰結束之後、兵事雖暫告段落、而商戰則又繼續開演、列强經濟　略、至今尙未減其野心、吾人觀察市上舶來貨品、莫不傾銷、幾欲使我國同品不能挿足、中國絲綢、向來執世界之牛耳、而現在國内絲繭商已奄奄一息、相繼　臥、回顧日本、則反不遺餘力提倡、此種現象、正猶戰士臨陣、不容退却、而我國商人之於商戰塲上、則已至最後掙扎狀態中矣、思之曷勝惕心、今日市商會新委員就職、吾輩商人、猶爲士卒、此後靜候諸君、居於官長地位、發號施令、站在同一戰線上、指揮吾人、努力進攻、對内抱和平、對外竭力抵抗到底、以圖救濟我國工商業一線之命脈云云、末由主席致答謝詞後、卽宣告散會、</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>溥儀之妾文繡與儀離異時，儀允許每月供給四百元，爲赡養費，今儀違背契約，分文不付，溥儀分明是要蛻毛了，文繡非常着急，急電溥儀，請埀念舊情，接濟赡養，這件事溥儀非但違背契約，亦是負義忘情，太無情面了。</p>
<p>惟當辛亥革命之際，我國政府，亦曾允許供給優待皇室經費，每年三百萬元，後因國帑支絀，漸漸蜕毛，致溥儀生活，大受打擊，從前我國政府蜕溥儀之毛，現在溥儀亦蜕文繡之毛，大蜕小蜕，溥儀果然眞乖，一學就會。</p>
<p>又據溥傑回電說：「主子要賜你死，你還敢來討赡養費！」溥儀在天津時，爲什麽不敢說這樣話，現在罩了外人的牌頭，說出這樣閃爍的大話，大有「君欲臣死不得不死」之槪，可是你也不要神氣十足，從前我國政府蜕了你的毛，安知後日日人不蜕你的毛呢？</p>
<p>一般遺老貴胃，恐文繡飘泊津門，出溥儀的醜，擬聯合多人，共籌目前瞻養費，我想亦可不必，你門一般窮措大的遺老貴胃，怎能彀月月措辦這一筆欵子呢，到底不免要蜕毛而止，還是讓文繡去飘泊津門，高張艷幟，借溥儀的大名，以號召獵艷的徒衆，怕每月得不到四百元大洋麽？</p>
<p>溥儀獻媚於日人，與文繡犧牲於所戀，原是相得益彰的事，有什麽面子不面子呢？</p>

<h3 id="c176">漂白粉製造法（下） <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 允釐</p>
<p>（三）製造的手續　　製造漂白粉的器具和原料旣預備好了，就可以着手製造。先將箱内各層板上鋪一寸多厚的石灰，次將通氯氣的玻璃管挿入箱下部的孔中，要挿得很牢，不能漏氣！然後將酒精燈點着，放在燒瓶下加熱，便有氯氣由玻璃管流入箱中，由下而上，完全被箱内逐層的石灰所吸收。經過五六時後，須在箱外玻璃窗中觀之，若箱内無顏色，即將製氯氣的玻瓶移開，將箱内逐層的石灰用棒攪拌。攪拌後，仍照前法通入氯氣。再經過五六時後，再在箱外窗中觀之，如仍不見顏色，再將箱内石灰仍照前法攪拌，再通氯氣。如見箱内下部現有黃色氣體時，這就是證明箱内下部的石灰已吸足氯氣了，此時須將玻璃管移至上部孔中，將下部之孔緊閉起來，再通氯氣，使上部的石灰吸收氯氣，等到箱内全部現有黃色氣體時，才可以拆去製造氯氣的玻瓶，停止氯氣通入箱中。這樣製好了之後，箱内的石灰，就成爲漂白粉了。　　這是小規模的製法，至於大規模的製造，是用許多鐵箱聯接起來，每個鐵箱内有一橫軸，軸之四圍有很多的齒。通氯氣時，軸徐徐轉動，就可以攪拌石灰，使之均匀的吸收氯氣。</p>
<p>（四）漂白粉的使用法</p>
<p>把漂白粉放在缸内，先注入稀硫酸，再加清水，使成稀薄的溶液；然後拿有色的布疋或紙張等物，浸入這溶液内後，再拿出來用清水輕輕洗滌。洗滌後又浸入缸内。像這樣的一浸一洗，經過了幾次後，有色的布疋就漸漸的漂得很白了。</p>
<p>（五）漂白粉的保存法</p>
<p>漂白粉若曝露在空氣中，就和水蒸氣或炭氣相化合，以致漸漸分解，失去漂白的作用。所以要裝入瓶内或木箱中，以免與外界空氣接觸。用木箱裝時，箱内必須襯薄鉛皮；外面接縫處，須用錫銲好，否則仍然無效。</p>
<p>（六）漂白粉何以能漂白？　　漂白粉能有漂白的作用，是因爲漂白粉放在缸内時，遇着硫酸，就放出氯氣來奪色素中的氯氣，使原來的成分分解，因而變成白色，所以漂白粉的作用，是在純粹的氯氣。</p>

<p>— 無畏</p>
<p>上課鐘是打了，敎三角的許先生；挾了皮包走進敎室，這時敎室裏的人數祇有三分之一，但是，經騐告訴他；在打上課鐘後的十分鐘内，學生總是這樣少的，所以他也毫不在意，祇照例做他的刻板功課｜點名｜在點名將近點好的時候，同學一個個魚貫而入了，有的嘴裏還一動動的在嚼着東西，有的挾着三角書，但書中至少夾着一本小說，或報紙。</p>
<p>「許先生Ｘ號到的，」他們進了敎室後；各個的嘴裏會自動的這樣說，許先生大槪年紀大了，涵養功夫好，所以火氣一點也没有，嘴裏祇唯唯的答應他們，同時眼手不停的找號數；替他們劃到，不過許先生眼睛近視的程度很深，所以這樣一緾，廿分鐘就很容易過去了。</p>
<p>大槪普通心理總是見善就欺，他們曉得許先生好欺，外加近視的程度又不淺，不好動的；就看報，看小說，好動的；大談山海經，有時還要動手動脚演一齣全武行，許先生總是笑嘻嘻說：「不要講話，你們年紀都不小了，開年要畢業了，快用心點聽·」這話等於白說，敎室裏仍是充满着談話聲，除非校長來了：纔會靜一刻？</p>
<p>這時許先生正面對着黑板：在做一問習題，好動的Ｌ，拿着彈弓：用黃豆想彈坐在第一排的Ｓ，不知怎樣的來，打在許先生的後腦袋上，他連忙掉轉身來想看是誰，但是，他目力不濟，所以就失望了。</p>
<p>「猪玀！眞勿要面孔，你們到底是人呢？啥：：」許先生光火了，他的脚</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>打着講臺，面孔漲得很紅，Ｌ是很乖的，連忙埋着頭假做在看書。</p>
<p>這時正在談話的幾個：經他這樣的一，弄得莫明其妙，呆住着也不嚮了，所以敎室裏的空氣也頓時肅靜起來。　　許先生這樣的獨自駡着，覺得没有了下塲，所以他面孔立刻又變和平了，他說：</p>
<p>「以後决不要胡閙，一惹我光火就要駡人，以後駡慣了大家無趣。我們做學生的時代也要講話，打岔，尋先生開心，不過没有你們利害：：好了，快用心看在書上，不要將來說都是許老頭子敎的不好：弄得我們不懂，其實呢！是你們自已不聽，但是，敎確是我敎的，賴也賴不掉，所以大家快用心：不要使我老頭子爲難？」大家聽了　堂大笑，頓時把靜肅的空氣冲破。</p>

<p>— 嚴夢</p>
<p>偶然因爲朋友的搬東西，我也一同回到北四川路曾經一度作過戰塲的大德里去。街道上桃色的女郎，扮得花枝招展的南國少女｜我的同鄉仙子們｜汽車箱内，或者馬路之旁，正展開青春的笑壓，一如緋紅的春花，胭脂的兩頰和口紅，是多麽動人的誘惑？酒排間的林立，銷金窟的　連，五步一咖啡店，十步一跳舞塲，猗歟盛世，北四川路之所以成爲神秘之路，意豈不在斯乎？</p>
<p>那繁華的市區，如今已經改樣了。當我們疲勞的脚踏上那疲勞的街頭，見到的，無非一片荒凉的瓦礫，火災後賸餘的殘骸，頽垣敗壁，再也不是當年的景象了。藍灰色的陸戰隊，不可一世的黃衣步兵，橫行在路的中央，獰笑着，操着凌亂的步伐。這些殺人的惡魔，上海是被他們任意摧殘夠了，此刻又踐入東北去，他們的刀，該又是一番的煊染｜我們民族之血了！</p>
<p>我們帶着忿恨的情緒走到大德里了。首先回到我的家去探望，然而，除了彈痕槍疤以外，冷落得像陰森的鬼府。我哀悼了和我相象了許些時候的帆布牀和寫字檯以及其他的東西，什麽也不能引起我更深的憑弔｜除却散失了不少的心血吐成的文稿。</p>
<p>低徊了好一會，我便從後門跑了出來，一出門口就遇着了一位在逃離闊别了許久的鄰居太太。她熱誠的問起我的生活，又問起過去的平安｜臨末，她更殷殷的追問，『大槪上海是不會再打仗了吧？』</p>
<p>『早知道今日，當初又何必開戰呢？』她關切而且覺得痛苦了，我聽了不禁感慨係之。她搖着頭，一邊嘆息一邊接續問我：『那麽上海到底怎麽樣呢？我們女人不懂事，你可曉得嗎？』我的内心那時很感受到悲哀的襲擊，不願意再說什麽。於是我們就分手了。在歸途上，我不住的想：『上海到底怎樣呢？』</p>

<p>「又｜」褲子碎的聲音。</p>
<p>「哈哈！」又是一陣哄堂大笑，幾百條視線，都直射在她倆的Ｘ和Ｘ，然而在泥醬似的地上，她們還在拚命的戰鬥，在他們不整的衣衫上，已揩满了污泥，嘴裏還在不斷的惡駡。</p>
<p>「喂，巡捕先生，你爲什麽不管管呀？」一個白髮的老者，對着站立在看的巡捕說。</p>
<p>「哦，老先生，人家說清官不斷家務事，這種事，我們不管的，哈哈！」巡捕說着依舊張著嘴，笑嘻嘻的看着。</p>
<p>「唉，人心不古，世風日下，我們出了捐錢，呌你們吃了飯看打架的嗎？豈有此理，唉，朝代要滅了！」老者譏諷的說着，慢慢的離了那巡捕。</p>
<p>「哼！」這是巡捕老爺的送行禮。</p>
<p>這時候全武行還在演着，不過已没有開始時的利害了。</p>
<p>不多一刻，大槪是兩主將已精疲力乏，才開始知道了她倆的醜態畢露，於是大家掩旗息鼓，在人聲沸騰，和笑聲盈野中，還夾着她們的駡聲。一幕全武行的趣劇就在無形中閉幕。</p>
<p>可是，這Ｍ路上，議論紛紜，紊亂嘈雜，已不似以前的幽靜了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Further Discussion on "Suppressing Bandits" and "Creating Bandits" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Following yesterday's commentary. We have already cited the reports of the bandit suppression generals and the conversations of central officials to confirm that the number of civilians becoming "bandits" is increasing day by day, and that the strength of the bandits is growing due to the driving force of poor politics. In fact, the corruption of greedy officials and corrupt bureaucrats and warlords who exploit the people, as well as the harm of sick politics to the people, does not stop there. The darkness of politics and the depth of the people's suffering are beyond what we can imagine.</p>
<p>Zhong Wei Ju Zheng once said, "Except for Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Shandong, all other provinces are planting opium. In the counties that plant opium, the amount of money collected from opium seedlings reaches hundreds of thousands to millions." In fact, in addition to forced planting, there is also forced selling and forced smoking. Furthermore, as Wang Jingwei said in his speech at the Central Memorial Week on the 27th of last month, "For example, the government of a certain province does not allow people to plant opium or sell opium, but he alone plants and sells opium. Opium seedlings are all over the province and are all privately owned. When there is too much opium, it is refined into heroin. This kind of public sale of opium is not only destroying the country, but simply exterminating the race." This opium is a harm to the people and indirectly a way to create "bandits."</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, although the government has explicitly ordered their abolition in name, in reality, they have increased rather than decreased. Warlords are dividing and ruling, each doing their own thing, which is beyond the reach of the central government's control. Taxes are heavy and various, such as the land tax in Sichuan has been pre-collected until the 30th year of the Republic of China. There are even more than dozens of kinds of taxes. For example, in Guangdong, transporting firewood from Lianjiang to Guangzhou is subject to heavy protection fees. Each firewood boat donates up to 500 yuan, and even empty boats returning to Lianjiang must pay 200 yuan. This one example illustrates the rest. Taxes in Jiangxi also amount to as many as sixteen or seventeen kinds. If Hunan cannot increase taxes any further, they cleverly create so-called "Good Citizen Donations" and issue "Good Citizen Certificates" to clarify that they are not "bandits." In short, this kind of situation is prevalent throughout the country. From local officials and garrison troops to local bullies, they only seek to fill their own pockets and satisfy their own desires. They do not hesitate to dig three feet into the ground and squeeze out the blood and flesh of the people. One family laughs, while ten thousand miles weep. This is another example of harsh government poisoning the people, indirectly creating "bandits."</p>
<p>Moreover, some "bandit suppression" troops, suppressing bandits in name, are actually suppressing the people. In areas with "bandits," the troops often watch and do not advance, avoiding the road. If they cannot avoid it, they retreat with their entire force, providing weapons to the "bandits." For example, the recent flight of Zhang Zhen's troops in Zhangzhou and the complete disintegration of Chen Diaoyuan's 46th Division in Hefei are examples of this. After the "bandits" retreat, they begin to probe forward. In every place they arrive, innocent farmers and pure young people are often labeled as "bandits," extorted, and if the extortion is not successful, they are brutally slaughtered. Then they lie and report to claim credit, saying that they have captured or killed a certain number, or that they have recovered a certain place, or that the bandits have collapsed and cannot form an army, or that our army is tracking and advancing. In reality, the troops disturb the people even more than the "bandits." The people's fear of the troops is also greater than their fear of the "bandits." Where the troops arrive, they cannot comfort the refugees or stabilize order. Moreover, the number of refugees increases day by day, and nine out of ten houses are empty. The saying "Bandits comb, soldiers shave, local defense scrapes" is the most truthful metaphor. This is another example of the troops poisoning the people, indirectly creating "bandits."</p>
<p>Politics are so dark, and the people are like those who have fallen into hell. This is exactly what is meant by "officials forcing the people to revolt." If officials force the people to revolt, how can the people not revolt? Once the people are forced to revolt, they are then surrounded and suppressed. What could be more tragic than this? We sincerely want to cry out for the tens of thousands of innocent compatriots who have died tragically.</p>
<p>The harm of human disasters is already so great, but the severity of natural disasters is even more devastating. There was a great drought in the Northwest the year before last, and a great flood across the country last year. The vitality of Jiangsu and Hebei has not yet recovered. According to a Zhengzhou telegram from the Guowen News Agency on May 22, "In Luyi and Tuocheng, the spring grain has been exhausted, and deaths are everywhere, too tragic to bear. In Luyi, Zhukai Store, Laoya Store, Ningping Town, Zeping Town, and Sangyuan Market, human markets have been established. Young women are worth ten yuan. Young children are only worth a thousand cash. Babies are abandoned everywhere. One family of three ate a set of rickshaw tires within five days. An old woman of a certain surname ate a basket of wheat straw for sixty days. Starving people who have died are immediately divided and eaten. A certain woman bought a steamed bun and pledged her young daughter as collateral." Furthermore, the famine victims' song compiled by the famine victims in Xuzhou says, "The well-fed do not know the hunger of the starving, there is no way to borrow, only call to heaven," "Stone powder, tree bark, and river grass, they swallow it with an empty stomach," "Forced to sell their children, the separation is the most heartbreaking." All these tragic scenes are truly rare in ancient times. Is this really the human world or hell? The people are so impoverished, how can they not be in chaos? Therefore, Wuxi, which is known as a prosperous place, experienced more than fifty rice-snatching incidents in the rural areas during the two weeks from the end of May to the beginning of June. In the Hanchuan area of Hubei, the seedlings and tree bark have all been eaten. The people have no way to survive and often join the "bandits." In short, it is human nature to struggle to survive. The disaster area is the "bandit" area. This is also how "bandits" are born and how the strength of the "bandits" grows day by day.</p>
<p>Politics are like that, and people's livelihoods are like that. Without reforming politics and stabilizing people's livelihoods, and wanting to use guns to drive away hunger and cold, and suppress the good people who are forced to take risks due to hunger and cold, can this really be effective? Lao Tzu said, "The people do not fear death, why threaten them with death?" In fact, it is not that the people do not fear death, but they have already suffered from hunger and cold, and are further threatened by guns. If, after the revolution, politics became more enlightened and people's livelihoods became more stable, then we dare to say that "bandits" would never arise, and the strength of "bandits" would never grow day by day. The reason why the "bandit" problem is spreading across the country today, to whom does the blame belong? Government officials should reflect on this.</p>
<p>What's more, the so-called "bandits" are those who disturb the local area and exploit the people. Judging by their actions, none of them are actively "creating bandits." If "bandits" should be suppressed, then shouldn't these "bandit creators" be suppressed first? However, in today's reality, "those who steal a country become lords, while those who steal a hook are executed." This is something we are greatly puzzled by.</p>
<p>In short, if politics are not enlightened and people's livelihoods are not stable, then even ten military suppressions will be ineffective. This is a theorem and there is absolutely no doubt about it. As for how to clarify politics and stabilize people's livelihoods, we will discuss it later.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Duan Xipeng, the acting president of Central University, issued an announcement on the 1st, stating that he had received instructions from the Ministry of Education, which stated that he had received Order No. 22 from the Executive Yuan (already seen in this newspaper yesterday, omitted here), etc. He stated that, upon receiving this, he should comply with the order and handle matters separately, ordering the students to leave the school within three days and await re-examination.

On the 30th, together with the Police Department, they went to the student dormitories of Central University twice, at 5 pm and 12 am, to summon several students involved in the incident, including Wang Zhiliang, Qian Qiming, Chen Kecheng, and Xie Yizhen, to the Garrison Headquarters for a brief interrogation, and then sent them to the local court for handling according to the law. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central University did not officially hold classes on the 1st. Some graduating students still held exams, and no one had complied with the order to leave the school. Most of the perpetrators who beat Duan have already fled Beijing secretly. To prevent further disputes, the Garrison Headquarters has prohibited student gatherings. With no one in charge of school affairs, it has become a scene of stagnation. The accounting department has stopped payments, but the registration department is still proceeding with enrollment. Most professors and students are quietly awaiting examination. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Matters Resolved at the Faculty Meeting <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 10 am on the 1st, the Central University faculty held its 18th faculty meeting in the Science Museum. Fifty-five professors attended, chaired by Ding Sixian and Zhang Qiyun. They reported that the government had not given a satisfactory response to the school's independent funding movement, and that after Ren Hongjun resigned, a formal president had not yet been announced. Recently, there was even news of the government dissolving the school. Therefore, a general meeting was convened to discuss everything. The proposals were as follows: 1. The government has explicitly ordered the dissolution of Central University, and the faculty members are preparing to leave the school. However, the issue of how to handle disaster relief donations and arrears of salary was discussed and decided that: A. Before leaving the school, the Disaster Relief Committee must issue formal receipts for disaster relief donations; B. Before leaving the school, the government must be responsible for fulfilling the employment contract and paying off all salaries. 2. The faculty members were deeply surprised by the assault on Vice President Duan Xipeng by a small number of students. However, Minister Zhu Jiaju made a statement implying that the faculty members were manipulating the situation, which insulted the faculty's personality. How should this be handled? It was decided that: the government should send impartial officials to thoroughly investigate. If it is not true, the slanderers should be punished in return. 3. Please have the government send impartial officials to thoroughly investigate the case of former President Zhu embezzling disaster relief funds. It was resolved and passed by all. 4. It was resolved that in addition to publishing the above resolutions in the newspapers, a statement should also be published in the name of the National Central University Faculty Association to announce it to the society. 5. Ten representatives were elected to execute the salary claim case. Zhang Shiyi and nine others were elected as representatives and went to the Executive Yuan that afternoon at 3 pm to petition.

<h3 id="e6">The Student Union Issues an Emergency Declaration <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central University Student Union issued an emergency declaration to all sectors of society on the 1st, stating that according to newspaper reports, the incident of beating Duan was only committed by three or five people and should not be blamed on more than 2,000 students and lead to dissolution. Moreover, Central University is the most historical school. Since the establishment of Nanjing Higher Normal School, it has endured the ravages of warlords and the destruction of evil forces, and has continued to this day, still being the highest institution of learning in the country. Now, suddenly dissolving the school due to an accidental incident, what would people across the country think? For this unfortunate incident, the government can use investigative methods to find out the truth and punish them by legal procedures, instead of using this unnecessary method to sacrifice the studies of more than 2,000 students. If all students are ordered to leave the school immediately, students from faraway places will have no economic support for a while and will be unable to return home. If they live outside the school, their lives will be even more difficult to maintain. Their situation of being displaced is even more unimaginable. At this time of national crisis, we did not want to say more, but for the sake of the future of education and our own studies, after grief and pain, we have no choice but to swear to fight to the death for the survival of our school. We hope that people across the country will uphold justice. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Main Points of the Declaration of Graduating Students <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Association of Graduating Students of National Nanjing Higher Normal School, Southeast University, and Central University issued a declaration regarding the sudden dissolution of their alma mater. The main points are as follows: Central University, all the way down from Nanjing Higher Normal School and Southeast University, has a long history of more than 20 years, and many talented people have emerged. The culture of Southeast China depends on its maintenance. Since the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, it has become the cultural center of the country and has achieved considerable success. Now, at a time when the issue of funding and the president has been delayed for half a year without a proper solution, and the day after President Wang satisfactorily agreed to the candidate for president requested by all the students of the alma mater, he broke his promise and suddenly sent Duan Xipeng to act as the president of the alma mater. Duan's learning and qualifications did not meet the expectations of the public, and his assumption of office was too hasty, arousing public anger. This was inevitable, and a small number of students acted too radically and clashed with Duan, which was also not wise. The revolutionary government should investigate the truth and determine who is right and wrong at this time and make a fair decision. This would be acceptable. Now, dissolving the entire faculty and students of the alma mater with a local incident is making a big deal out of a small issue, which is unreasonable. Before and after the incident at the alma mater, the school was still studying and the order was normal, without any out-of-line actions. Duan also reported to the Central Government that only a small number of people clashed with him. The facts prove that the responsibility lies with someone. It is difficult to justify a complete erasure. The elders send their children to school with their blood and sweat, and their only purpose is to hope that the teachers will teach them to the best of their ability and try to reform the bad ones. It is inhumane to punish them without teaching them. How can severe punishments for small mistakes convince the public and reassure the people? Moreover, the place of learning has suffered since the Japanese invaders entered the country last year, withdrawing our Northeast education and destroying our Shanghai schools. Chinese culture has been severely ravaged, and students have been displaced, which is a concern for patriots. Now, Central University has survived the Japanese bombing in the capital, and students from all over the country who have lost their studies are still coming from afar to study with pain and tears. The government does not show sympathy or consideration, and resolutely dissolves Central University. Is this for the country, for the party, or for the sake of saving face at the expense of the only surviving university in our country? (Omitted) We hope that the government authorities will consider the difficulties of the country and the difficulty of cultivating talents, forgive the unfortunate incident caused by the temporary indignation of three or five students of the alma mater, withdraw the order to dissolve Central University, and seek other proper solutions so that the only highest institution of learning during this national crisis can continue to study academics and serve the country. We also hope that all the elders, brothers, and sisters across the country will uphold justice and fairness, not only is this Association grateful, but we are also submitting a petition to the Executive Yuan to request the withdrawal of the order.

<p>Reporting on the Latest Situation of Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>That Evening Accompanied Wang Jingwei and Others to Shanghai</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin, accompanied by his wife Wang Wenxiang, daughter Yi Zhang, Chief Secretary of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters Xie Zhongyuan, Secretary Lin Zhiqi, Adjutant Wang Guozhong, and others, arrived in Nanjing on the Jiangshun steamer on the 30th morning. At 11:30 AM, he went to the Executive Yuan to meet Wang Jingwei to report on the latest situation of bandit suppression. At noon, Wang held a banquet at his private residence in the Ministry of Railways to welcome He. Chen Shaokuan, Huang Shaoxiong, Chen Shuren, Chen Yi, Zeng Zhongming, and others were invited to accompany them. According to He, when he first arrived in Jiangxi, he deeply felt that the bandit areas were vast and transportation was obstructed. If he wanted to suppress them all at once, not only would the military force be insufficient, but it would also be easy to be passive as the bandits could flee from one place to another. Therefore, he decided on a method of suppressing the bandits by dividing the areas and emphasized the simultaneous advancement of politics and military affairs, addressing both the root causes and symptoms. He adopted a policy of gradual suppression by ensuring stability and security. In terms of politics, he actively engaged in building roads and organizing local self-defense groups as military progress was made. At the same time, he ordered Yu Hanmou's Guangdong National Revolutionary Army and the Hunan-Jiangxi National Revolutionary Army to jointly encircle and suppress Peng Dehuai's bandit troops who were harassing the border of Hunan. They successively defeated the main force of the Peng bandits in Guidong, Rucheng, Jilong Shangbao, and other places, killing more than several thousand bandits. Afterwards, although the bandits took the opportunity to flee to You, Cha, Ling, and Ning, hoping to harass them, they were unable to succeed because our army pursued and blocked them effectively. Currently, the bandits, after repeated defeats, are exhausted and desperate. They fled back to Yingqian Sis hun in an attempt to contact the bandits west of Jiangxi, and then make a major move. However, they are still within our army's encirclement, and it will not be long before they are completely annihilated. As for Zhu De's group who fled to Fujian, after our Zhang Zhen, Chen Guohui, and other troops recovered Zhangzhou, the 19th Route Army is now also entering Fujian one after another. The bandits are extremely panicked and are fleeing to the Fujian-Jiangxi border in a very embarrassed state. Recently, Lin Biao's group was encircled and suppressed by Huang Renhuan's Guangdong army near Tinghang, resulting in approximately 2,000 casualties. It is reported that Lin Biao was also seriously injured. After the entire 19th Route Army arrives in Fujian, it will be easier to eliminate them by attacking from both sides.

<p>(Geneva) The Special Committee of Nineteen will meet at 3 PM today, and the plenary session will be held at 5 PM. British Foreign Secretary Simon will attend both meetings. (10th day Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Secretariat of the League of Nations published the exchange of letters between Simon, Chairman of the League of Nations Assembly and the Committee of Nineteen, and the Chinese and Japanese delegations regarding the extension of the deadline for submitting the report of the Liaoning Case Investigation Team. The letter from Yan Huiqing, Chief Representative of China, in response to Simon's proposal to extend the deadline, stated that China hopes that the extension of the deadline will not be unduly delayed, so that the League of Nations Assembly can determine its attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute before November. It also stated that although the League of Nations has made various resolutions, Japan is still expanding the scope of its military operations in China and openly supporting the puppet state of Manchuria. Under these circumstances, China is still willing to postpone the submission of the report only because it firmly hopes that the League of Nations will not allow Japan to further aggravate the situation. The Japanese reply only expressed agreement to the extension and reiterated Japan's previous reservations regarding its position in Manchuria. Simon replied to the two delegations, expressing his firm belief that both parties involved will abide by the obligations they have undertaken in the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations, and avoid any actions that would further aggravate the situation.

<p>(Washington) The US Department of State issued a statement today regarding the puppet state of Manchuria seizing the Dalian Customs. US Ambassador to Japan Grew has expressed his views to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This negotiation is based on Japan's obligations regarding the Dalian Customs under the Sino-Japanese Treaty and the fact that the Dalian Customs is also under the guarantee of the US portion of the Boxer Indemnity. According to what is heard here, the Japanese government has replied that it also wants to maintain the integrity of the Chinese Customs and will study the matter. It is also heard that the British Ambassador to Japan has also engaged in similar negotiations. (30th day Kuomin News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>London - Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question from a member of parliament regarding Dalian Customs that the British government has expressed its intention to the Japanese government, hoping that the Japanese government will not allow any actions that would undermine the 1907 Customs Agreement of the Three Eastern Provinces, so as not to hinder the interests of foreigners in customs affairs or further increase the complexity of resolving disputes in the Three Eastern Provinces. (1st day Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>London - The occupation of Dalian Customs continues to be criticized by various newspapers, and questions regarding this issue are frequently raised in Parliament. However, it is generally expected that the major powers will not take any action on this matter before the Lytton Investigation Team's report is received in Geneva. Weekly and Sunday publications have stated that the occupation of the customs is simply an insult to the educated people of the major powers, and that the Japanese government's command of the puppet government is as victorious as its undeclared war.

<p>The Puppet State Will Appoint Kato as Customs Commissioner of Harbin</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Proposes a Mediation Plan to the Puppet State</p>
<p>(Harbin) There was a shocking development in the Manchurian Customs issue today. Customs officials in Manchuria are now being detained and forced to serve under Manchurian officials. It is not clear from the telegram whether this action was carried out by Japanese police or Manchurian police, but since the local customs officials were surrounded by Japanese police yesterday, it is likely that the captors are the same group. Several Chinese and Russian officials of the Harbin Customs who had been dismissed were reinstated today by the "Manchurian State" authorities to replace the officials who were loyal to the Chinese Customs and refused to serve the "Manchurian State." (1st day Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On June 28, the Manchurian Customs was seized by the "Manchurian State" authorities. The only Chinese assistant commissioner of the customs was detained by Japanese police and sent to Harbin, arriving here today and still in custody. There are a total of 220 officials in the Harbin Customs, but only six Chinese officials are currently serving, while the rest are in hiding. It is generally believed that the "Manchurian State" will appoint Kato, director of the South Manchurian Railway Wharf Division, as the Customs Commissioner of Harbin. (1st day Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the Japanese consul in Changchun to inform the "Manchurian State" authorities that Japan's mediation plan for the customs issue is final and cannot be changed. The "Manchurian State" should accept it, otherwise it will suffer adverse consequences. The plan is as follows: (1) The "Manchurian State" authorities may manage all customs in Manchuria, except for Dalian. Dalian Customs will remain under Chinese management to clear its foreign debt obligations. (2) If the revenue of Dalian Customs is insufficient to meet its foreign debt obligations, the Changchun authorities should allocate funds to Nanjing to make up for the shortfall. (3) Fukumoto, the Customs Commissioner of Dalian, will be reinstated. (1st day Reuters telegram)</p>

<p>(Xiamen) Red bandits Luo Binghui and the Longyong local communists, numbering about 30,000, launched a fierce attack on Shizhong on the 27th in two directions. By noon, the telephone lines between Zhangzhou and Shizhong were cut off, and the postal service between Yanping and Zhangzhou was also interrupted. On the 4th, according to people from Hexi, Shizhong has been surrounded on all sides. The local militia is fighting hard, but the truth is not clear. The false 37th division, masquerading as Red bandits, attacked Kan City of Yongding on the 27th. The militia gained and lost ground, and ultimately gave up due to lack of ammunition, losing over 100 weapons and breaking through the encirclement. The false 38th division attacked Longtan Township on the 28th, and the militia defended it and did not lose it. The Yanping and Yongding militia are strong in combat, but lack ammunition and lack a main force. It is very dangerous for the national army to advance and provide assistance.

<p>Advocating That Germany Must Pay the Last Two Batches of Money</p>
<p>Used for European Economic Rehabilitation and Compensation for US Debt</p>
<p>Kuomin News Agency, Lausanne, 30th - Although the atmosphere of today's meeting is still full of hope, the situation has remained unchanged since Germany insisted on a practical solution to the reparations issue, refusing to consider anything else, and Britain and France wanted to demand a guarantee clause regarding war debts to the United States, creating a stalemate. Tonight, Herriot clearly stated before departing for Paris that Germany does not want the conference to break down due to the amount of compensation for the cancellation of reparations, but must insist on recognizing the linkage between Allied war debts and reparations. Furthermore, France cannot agree to link the reparations issue with the arms reduction issue or any political concessions. The French Prime Minister's words failed to indicate that any progress had been made in today's negotiations. According to reports, the main agenda of today's negotiations, which lasted from morning to afternoon, was a proposal by the five creditor countries stipulating that Germany should pay the last two batches of money, one for 1 billion marks, and the other for an uncertain amount, approximately between 4 billion and 7 billion marks. The former batch would be Germany's contribution to the European Economic Rehabilitation Fund, and other countries would also contribute. The latter batch would be the amount that the United States demanded after negotiating war debts with the United States in the future, which Germany should compensate for. Therefore, the amount is still difficult to determine. However, the German representatives opposed this plan, claiming that since the amount of German debt is vague and cannot be determined, it will inevitably prolong the current uncertain situation and greatly reduce the achievements of the conference. Currently, the Germans have agreed to propose a counter-proposal to reach a compromise solution, but if a compromise cannot be reached by then, the breakdown of the conference in the next week may be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 1st - French Prime Minister Herriot returned to Paris today. The Main Committee completed its meeting at midnight today. The German representatives did not attend. MacDonald decided not to leave for the time being.</p>
<p>Kuomin News Agency, Lausanne, 30th - Before French Prime Minister Herriot departed for Paris tonight, he suddenly visited German Prime Minister Papen and had a confidential talk for about half an hour before leaving. It is reported that although the views of Germany and France are still divided, the hope for the success of the conference has increased due to this meeting.</p>
<p>Kuomin News Agency, Lausanne, 30th - After the Main Committee of the Lausanne Conference adjourned tonight, it will continue tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM. Currently, France insists that if Europe still has to repay US war debts, Germany must compensate. However, Germany still opposes, saying that it has no choice but to refuse in terms of the situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th - Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain arrived near here from Lausanne tonight and immediately went to the cabinet meeting to report on the progress of the conference.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Kuomin News Agency, Lausanne, 1st - The fate of the reparations conference will probably be decided today, as the five creditor countries agreed on a final suggestion last night to mediate the reparations dispute, and submitted it to the German delegation this morning. The German delegation agreed to reply at today's meeting. It is heard that the new plan was initiated by British Prime Minister MacDonald, and the Germans consider it more reasonable than the plans proposed in the past. It does not mention the word "reparations", but only outlines the main points, and all the details will be negotiated in the future. What is required of Germany is to promise to pay a certain amount of money, the number of which is not listed. It is now believed to be 5 billion marks, or equal to two batches of Young Plan annual payments. The method of payment is for Germany to issue a sufficient number of railway bonds and deposit them in the Bank for International Settlements. After the five-year moratorium expires, the interest on these bonds will be paid. The interest will probably be set at 4%. Most of the money paid by Germany will be used for European economic rehabilitation, and the remainder will be used to settle the remaining debts of US debtors.</p>
<p>Kuomin News Agency, Lausanne, 1st - British Prime Minister MacDonald and German Prime Minister Papen met this morning to discuss a new plan to resolve the reparations issue. German Finance Minister Groschke also participated in the discussion. The result is unknown, only that the German delegation claimed that Prime Minister Papen, eager to demonstrate the German people's good intentions, discussed this plan with the chairman of the conference. As for the details of the new plan, more details have been revealed, that the old Allied countries also have several inconsistent opinions. It is heard that Britain believes that 5 billion marks is the maximum that Germany's financial resources can afford to pay successively over a long period after the five-year moratorium expires. France still insists on 7 billion marks, while Belgium objects to other points. Although the Italian representatives expressed their agreement when presenting this plan, they declared that they reserved their opinion. Therefore, it is generally expected today that even if the German representatives can agree to the principle of the new plan, it will still take several negotiations to fully agree based on this principle.</p>

<p>Three Ballots Still Fail to Produce a Winner</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Smith in a Fierce Contest</p>
<p>Repealing Prohibition Becomes a Major Plank in Platform  Reuters, Chicago, July 1 – After a night of speeches and parades at the Democratic Party Convention, this morning was dedicated to electing a presidential candidate. Of the nine candidates nominated, New York Governor Roosevelt is considered the most promising, followed by Mr. Smith. The other seven are: Speaker of the House, Mr. Garner; former Governor of Virginia, Mr. Byrd; Governor of Maryland, Mr. Ritchie; former Senator from Missouri, Mr. Reed; prominent Chicago banker, Mr. Traylor; Governor of Ohio, Mr. White; and Governor of Oklahoma, Mr. Murray. In the first ballot, no candidate secured a majority. Roosevelt received 666 and one-quarter votes, falling short of the required majority by 103 and three-quarters votes. Smith received 201 and three-quarters votes, and Garner received 90 and one-quarter votes. Roosevelt declared that he advocates continuing the convention until a presidential candidate is determined.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Chicago, July 1 – After the results of the first ballot were announced, the second ballot commenced immediately. The vote count was completed around 8 AM this morning. Roosevelt gained an additional 11 and a half votes from the first ballot, totaling 677 and three-quarters votes, still failing to secure the nomination. Smith lost seven votes compared to the first ballot. In the third ballot, Roosevelt saw only a slight increase from the second, still failing to reach the two-thirds vote threshold. The convention adjourned at 9 AM this morning and is scheduled to resume at 8:30 PM tonight.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chicago, June 30 – Roosevelt, considered the most likely to be nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate, today endorsed one of the most important planks passed by the Democratic Party Convention: the direct repeal of Prohibition.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chicago, June 30 – Proponents of Prohibition were greatly alarmed today upon hearing that the Democratic Party had passed a platform plank directly repealing Prohibition, and that Roosevelt endorsed the proposal. Some advocated for independently electing a presidential candidate, while others proposed refraining from involvement in the presidential election altogether and instead focusing on electing a majority of Congressmen who support Prohibition. Those who advocate for repealing Prohibition are celebrating across the nation. The nomination of Roosevelt as the Democratic presidential candidate is particularly welcomed. At the convention hall, hundreds of delegates, upon hearing Roosevelt’s name, fervently shouted and danced around the hall, throwing their hats high into the air for forty minutes. Voting is scheduled to begin on July 1st. Many believe Congress will soon pass legislation allowing the sale of light wine and beer. The Democratic Party opposes the immediate payment of bonuses to veterans and rejected the proposal for remonetization of silver.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, June 30 – A Reuters correspondent covering diplomatic affairs has learned that a global monetary conference is now likely to become a reality and will be held in London. Although MacDonald is scheduled to return here early next week, he is actively pursuing this matter in Lausanne. A thirteen-member committee has been formed in Lausanne, with each of the six major countries sending two representatives in addition to the British Prime Minister. It is anticipated that the results of this committee’s deliberations will expand the scope of the Lausanne conference, leading to the realization of the London monetary conference.</p>

<p>War Bonds Exchanged for New Bonds</p>
<p>Interest Rate Reduced from 5% to 3.5%</p>
<p>Treasury Can Save £30 Million Annually</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, June 30 – British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain announced a major financial plan in the House of Commons today, proposing that holders of £2 billion in 5% war bonds voluntarily exchange them for government bonds with lower interest rates, thereby saving the treasury £30 million annually in interest payments. According to Chamberlain, these savings will not be realized in the current fiscal year but will be fully reflected in the 1933 budget. Currently, there are nearly 3 million holders of war bonds.</p>
<p>The government plans to issue new bonds to replace the old ones on December 1st. Those who do not wish to exchange their bonds for new ones and prefer to receive cash repayment may request redemption within three months. Interest payments due on December 1st will still be calculated at the annual rate of 5%. Interest payments due on July 1st of next year will be reduced to 3.5%. As of April 1st of this year, the total amount of war bonds was £2,084,994,000, accounting for slightly less than one-third of the total British national debt of £7,420,775,000. Approximately £200 million to £500 million of these bonds are held by foreigners. Currently, the average interest rate on other British domestic debt is no more than 4%, while war bonds alone bear a rate of 5%, and income tax is not deducted in advance. The treasury pays more than £100 million annually in war bond interest. Therefore, Snowden, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, had this plan a year ago. At that time, the Bank of England’s discount rate was only 2.5%, which was conducive to bond exchange. Snowden wanted to wait for the discount rate to decrease further but delayed implementation. Unexpectedly, an unprecedented crisis occurred in the global financial world, ultimately forcing Britain to abandon the gold standard, thereby losing the opportunity to exchange bonds. The current financial situation is again favorable for bond exchange. The bank discount rate has fallen to 2.5% again, the national budget has already been balanced, the pound is stable, and credit is relatively loose. There is no risk of a sudden surge in the bank discount rate, and there is no need to raise bank interest rates to prevent foreigners from withdrawing their deposits. It is indeed an opportune time for bond exchange. Therefore, Chamberlain made this proposal.</p>

<p>British Government Plans to Impose Special Tax to Compensate</p>
<p>Reuters, London, June 30 – A conflict has arisen between Britain and Ireland because the Irish Free State has decided to suspend land tax payments. The land tax was due today, but the Free State has not made payment. British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Thomas stated in the House of Commons today that he will introduce a bill tomorrow to discuss how to respond. This statement was met with cheers. According to reliable sources, the bill to be introduced tomorrow will be titled the Free State Special Tax Bill. It will authorize the cabinet to issue orders increasing import duties on Irish products to compensate for the unpaid land tax, so that the British will not suffer losses. The revenue from this special tax is estimated at £2 million per year. Acting Prime Minister Baldwin stated that the wording of the proposal should be extremely careful to avoid the appearance of retaliation.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, July 1 – Goods entering Great Britain from the Irish Free State, either directly or via other countries, may be subject to a special tax not exceeding a certain percentage of their value. Existing tariffs will remain in effect. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Thomas will introduce this motion in the House of Commons on July 4th, as de Valera is currently withholding six months of land tax amounting to £1.5 million, hence the intention to counteract this. This land tax was due on June 15th. In previous years, it was usually remitted by June 30th, but no check has been received from the Irish Free State yesterday, indicating an absence of intent to pay.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, June 30 – During questioning in the House of Commons today, Liberal Party MP Mander stated that he feared the use of the Boxer Indemnity might not align with what was permitted. The custodians of these funds had requested documents from the Chinese government granting permission for interest payments or repayment of principal, but the Chinese government ignored them. Therefore, he had doubts about the proper use of the indemnity. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden responded that he knew the funds were being used properly, but that the Chinese Ministry of Railways, apart from issuing certain regulations, had not yet reached a satisfactory agreement on a full plan to ensure that the funds used could generate income for educational purposes. Mander then asked the British government to monitor the Chinese government’s fulfillment of its obligations to Britain. Eden agreed.</p>

<h3 id="e75">The Antecedents and Consequences of the Red Peril in Fujian (A Xiamen Dispatch) <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Before addressing the main topic, I must make a few preliminary remarks. My hometown is in southern Fujian, and I have been living on Gulangyu Island, residing in Southeast Asia, for nearly twenty years. Now, seeing the Red bandits first occupy Tinglong, then capture Zhangzhou, with Xiamen and Quanzhou also in imminent danger, I fear that if rescue is not swift, the entire province of Fujian will soon become a red world. Fujian, especially southern Fujian, is the ancestral home of millions of overseas Chinese in the islands of Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and territories of Britain, the Netherlands, America, France, and Siam. Who does not have a hometown? Who does not have relatives? Who does not have ancestral graves? How can we bear to sit idly by and watch it sink, witnessing the present, reflecting on the past, and fearing the future? I earnestly hope that my millions of Fujianese overseas Chinese will investigate the root causes of the problem and rise together to save it. Then we shall be fortunate indeed.</p>
<p>The areas of western and southern Fujian now occupied by the Red Army have established so-called Soviet governments and are implementing their destructive measures, including burning, killing, looting, raping, confiscating private property, and destroying contracts. These tragic scenes have already unfolded one after another. The people of Ting, Zhang, and Long are suffering the pain of family destruction, death, displacement, and the bitterness of all kinds of hardship. The number of refugees fleeing to Xiamen has reached 200,000. Although there is a refugee camp on Gulangyu, it is a drop in the ocean and of no avail. The capitalists of Xiamen are still sweeping the snow from their own doorsteps. Recently, the YMCA has stepped forward to establish a reception center, but it is limited to accommodating only 300 people. The majority of refugees are still exposed to the elements, appearing like stray dogs. This miserable situation is still burgeoning, and the Red Peril is expanding daily. Time continues to drag on, and the people of Quanzhou and Xiamen are in constant fear. The cries of the people for help are exhausted and hoarse. Although there are reports of reinforcements being sent from various quarters, they are all empty thunder with no rain. Initially, the Guangdong Army once advanced to the Fujian border, but later, due to internal disputes over the merger of the navy and air force, the troops were recalled. The Guangxi Army's entry into Fujian has been called for repeatedly, but there is still no news of mobilization. Alas, the people of Fujian are suffering and rolling in the depths of water and fire, awaiting death. The homeland of millions of overseas Chinese is about to sink, their family properties have been destroyed, and their relatives are about to die. Those living far overseas are watching such tragic scenes with anguish, unable to find a way to save themselves, and their appeals go unheard. Their hearts are cut like a knife, and they want to cry but have no tears. Party and government officials, in every sentence, call overseas Chinese the mother of the revolution and encourage them to return to the country to start businesses, which is a government policy. Yet, they are now allowing the hometowns of overseas Chinese to be shattered to this extent. Therefore, I only hope that we Fujianese, especially my millions of Fujianese overseas Chinese, will consider how we can save our hometowns in the future. Like a doctor treating a disease, we must first understand the source of the illness, and then prescribe the right medicine to have any hope of bringing back the dead.</p>
<p>Today's Red Peril in Fujian has become a prairie fire. The direct sowers of the seeds of disaster are the various garrison units disguised as bandits, such as the former Gao Yi, Guo Fengming, Wu Wei, and Yang Hanlie, and the current Lu Xingbang, Lin Shouguo, Chen Guohui, Lin Zhong, and the troops of Zhang Zhen, who is known as the commander of the 49th National Revolutionary Army. Indirectly, it is the foolish and incompetent Fujian Provincial Government of the Naval faction. And the former central authorities must also bear responsibility for this situation. I will now delve into this issue.</p>
<p>(1) The Various Garrison Units in Fujian are the Cause of the Red Bandits</p>
<p>After the Northern Expeditionary Army departed from Fujian Province, Tan Shuqing was left behind in Fujian. He incorporated all the bandits who were normally despised by the people, calling them the Newly Organized First Army. At that time, Gao Yi, Wu Wei, Lu Xingbang, Guo Fengming, Chen Guohui, Gao Wei, Yang Hanlie, Ye Dingguo, Wang Hanmin, You Sifu, and others were all division commanders, brigade commanders, and regimental commanders. The people of Fujian, unable to endure their devastation and exploitation, rose up in opposition and appealed for help. Finally, in the winter of 1927, the Eleventh Army (now the 19th Route Army) entered Fujian and violently resolved the Newly Organized Army. At that time, Gao Yi and Yang Hanlie (Wu Wei had already died, and his troops were under Gao Yi) were disarmed in the province. However, Ye Dingguo's unit tried to flee back to their old lair in Tongan, but was completely disarmed by the people of Huyang along the way. Chen Guohui had been transferred to Longyan in advance, and Guo Fengming fled from Quanzhou back to Tingzhou and Yongding. Unfortunately, they could not be rounded up in one fell swoop. In less than two months, the Eleventh Army returned to Guangdong, and the Marine Corps filled the defenses of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. Soon after, Zhang Zhen's troops also returned to Fujian from Jiangshan County in Zhejiang. The Navy handed over the defense of Zhangzhou to Zhang Zhen. Initially, the people of southern Fujian held a warm hope for Zhang Zhen's return to Fujian, hoping that he could continue the Eleventh Army's thorough work of clearing bandits. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Zhangzhou, he acted contrary to the wishes of the people and did his best to incorporate large and small groups of bandits to expand his own power. Although the people fiercely opposed him, he stubbornly persisted and ignored them. Miscellaneous taxes and levies were increased again. Therefore, the people of Zhangzhou had a folk song that said, "Zhang Yi changed to Zhang Zhen, miscellaneous levies increased by two sheng, regardless of the people's suffering, exclusively recruiting bandit soldiers." This is enough to show the people's sentiment. The counties of Quanzhou and Yongchun were still garrisoned by the Second Brigade of the Marine Corps under Lin Shouguo, who competed to incorporate the bandits Wang Lianming and Gao Weiguo, condoning their rampant extortion, looting, arson, and murder. The people of Jinjiang, Nan'an, and Hui'an were in deep water and fire, while he sat by and shared the spoils. At the same time, Chen Guohui in Longyan and Guo Fengming in Tingzhou and Yongding were even more capable of extreme exploitation and killing. Those who slightly opposed them in Longyan and Tingzhou were repeatedly killed. At that time, Xie Baoxuan, a member of the Longyan County Party Committee, Chen Xueqin, a commissioner, and a member of the Tingzhou Party Committee (whose name I have forgotten), were all brutally murdered for opposing Chen and Guo. Therefore, in the area of western Fujian, all young people with intellectual backgrounds could not gain a foothold, and a large number of them joined the Communist Party. It can truly be said that "driving fish into the deep, driving birds into the thicket." Thus, the Red Peril in western Fujian arose in 1928. Guo Fengming himself was buried in the new tomb he had dug himself, and his entire force was wiped out by the Red Army. The Red Army took advantage of the situation to attack Chen Guohui in Longyan. This time, Chen's troops suffered heavy losses. However, at that time, the Red Army's strength was not yet strong enough, and it temporarily subsided. After Chen Guohui learned this lesson, not only did he not repent, but he became even more tyrannical and reckless, which led to the Red Army's second attack on Longyan in the spring and summer of 1929. This time, Chen Guohui was almost completely wiped out. He escaped to Tongan and concentrated his remaining three or four hundred men. He himself was almost killed. Longyan was lost, and the area of western Fujian became a red world. Subsequently, the provincial government issued an order to suppress Chen. The incident of Lu Xingbang detaining the provincial government committee members occurred. Chen's bandits were then re-incorporated by Fang Shengtao and given the title of Provincial Defense Army. Before long, they were stationed in Quanzhou and Yongchun, appearing as if they were solely responsible for one area. They colluded with Zhang Zhen and acted recklessly, wantonly extorting and exploiting the people. Last winter, they became even more audacious, blatantly forcing the planting of opium seedlings and collecting opium seedling donations. Zhang Zhen actually collected seven or eight million yuan in the counties of Zhangzhou and Tongan, while Chen Guohui actually collected six or seven million yuan in Quanzhou and Yongchun. When the operating expenses and the pockets of the contractors are added together, the total is no less than 20 million yuan. If the counties of Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Yongchun have been bled dry year after year to the point of poverty and destitution, how can they withstand such an extreme and insatiable squeeze? Now, the military officers of Zhang and Chen, from battalion commanders and above, have accumulated tens of thousands to millions of yuan in wealth from the people's fat and blood. Therefore, it has also aroused the Red bandits' covetousness, and they have launched a large-scale invasion. At this time, the military officers of Zhang's troops, in order to protect their lives and property, fled at the first sign of trouble. When they withdrew from Zhangzhou, they used a large number of porters to transport opium and cash, while the most needed guns and ammunition for military use were burned to the ground. Since Zhangzhou has fallen, the heavy losses it has suffered are well-deserved. However, the people of Zhanglong have suffered a terrible ravaging, and even hundreds of lives cannot atone for the crimes. In short, if it were not for the brutality and exploitation of Guo Fengming and Chen Guohui, there would be no Red Peril in western Fujian. If it were not for Zhang Zhen's corruption and greed, there would be no tragic situation in Zhangzhou today. Therefore, I say that the cause of the Red Peril in Fujian is these garrison units disguised as bandits, and I have not wronged them in the slightest. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Suppress Bandits in Three Routes <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Chiang Concurrently Leads the Central Route, He and Li Take Charge of the Left and Right Wings</p>
<p>Liu Zhi Arrives in Hankou from Henan to Seek Instructions</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After arriving in Hankou, Chiang Kai-shek, the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, began working at the headquarters on the 29th. On the 30th, he summoned the generals for talks and finalized the overall military plan for bandit suppression. At the same time, he announced the commanders and deputy commanders for the three routes of bandit suppression. On that day, Chiang arrived at the headquarters at 9:00 AM and successively received Zhang Yinxiang, the commander of the 30th Army, He Jingwu, the director of the Ping-Han Railway Bureau, Zhang Zhenhan, the commander of the 41st Division, Xiao Zhichu, the commander of the 44th Division, Rong Jingfang, the commander of the 82nd Division, Tang Enbo, the commander of the 89th Division, Yu Jishi, the commander of the 88th Division, Liu Peixu, the commander of the 37th Independent Brigade, Pan Shanzhai, the commander of the 38th Brigade, and Jiang Zuojun, the commander of the 3rd New Brigade, etc. After individual talks, he assembled them for instructions, mainly stating that in recent years, the bandit forces in the central provinces have become increasingly rampant, and the people have been living in misery. Last year, there was a flood, followed by the Shandong and Tianjin-Shanghai incidents, and the bandit forces became even more rampant, increasing the suffering of the people. Now, bandit suppression has become an urgent task related to the survival of the Party and the nation, and is of utmost importance. He, Chiang, was ordered to come to Hankou and was determined to exert the greatest effort to eliminate the scourge for the people. All officers shared the military responsibility and should use their best efforts to complete the mission. If the Red bandits were not cleared, there would be no way to answer to the Party, the nation, the people, the leader, and the martyrs, and no way to answer to themselves. He, Chiang, had long understood the hard work and struggle of the comrades in the past and hoped that everyone would pay attention to two points in the future: (1) Rectify military discipline and cooperate with the people. Strict military discipline will make the effectiveness even more substantial. With the support of the people, the bandits and communists can be more easily eliminated. (2) Obey the orders of superiors. The situation in Wuhan is complex, and attacks and rumors can be seen at any time. Everyone should recognize that those who attack their comrades and superiors are attacking themselves and must work together under the leadership of their officers to eliminate the great scourge of the Party and the nation, so that the people can have permanent peace. He also hoped that all comrades would respect the Party and its doctrines and policies so that they can be realized. After the instructions, Chiang returned to the Yihua Village residence and ordered the adjutant's office and the Supervisory Office to notify the following personnel to attend the hearing at the appointed time: on July 1st, members of the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Hankou Special City Party Headquarters; on the 2nd, members of the Hubei Provincial Government and the heads of various departments; on the 4th, regimental commanders and above of the Ping-Han Railway (Southern Section) and the troops stationed in Wuhan would be summoned for instructions; and the Provincial Government would be ordered to telegraph all county magistrates to attend the provincial meeting and summoned for instructions before July 10th. That night, Chiang decided to divide the bandit suppression into three routes. The central route was along the Ping-Han Railway, with Chiang concurrently serving as the commander and Liu Zhi as the deputy commander; the right route was along the Jinpu Railway, with Li Jishen as the commander and Wang Jun as the deputy commander; and the left route was in the counties of central Hubei, with He Chengjun as the commander and Xu Yuanquan as the deputy commander. Below the commander, there would be a column commander, and the candidates had been decided internally but not announced. After the deployment was determined, the Pacification Commissioners, Commanders-in-Chief, Commanders of Armies, Divisions and Brigades, and Commanders of Various Commands were instructed that in the future, without orders, they were not allowed to leave their defense areas without permission and come to Hankou casually. Those in Hankou were required to return to their defense areas by July 1st. Until 9:00 PM, Chiang hosted a banquet for Navy Commander Zeng Yiding and the captains of the various ships, and also hosted Li Yuying and his wife, who had just arrived in Hankou from Nanjing. The arrangements for Lojia Mountain were originally prepared by the Provincial Government for Chiang's temporary residence, but due to the pressing military affairs, the trip may be cancelled. It is rumored that the future residence has been chosen as Jigong Mountain, and the director of the Ping-Han Railway Bureau has telegraphed the stationmaster to arrange Jin Yun'e's residence. The date of departure has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Liu Zhi, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government and Pacification Commissioner stationed in Henan, personally led the First, Second, and Thirty-third Divisions to Minggang to supervise the bandit suppression due to the bandit alarm on the Ping-Han Railway. Now that the bandits have been routed and the entire railway has been repaired and opened to traffic, he accompanied Jiang Chu'ou, the commander of the railway artillery team, south by train on the 30th. They arrived at 12:00 PM that night and met with Chiang in the morning of the 1st to report on the progress of bandit suppression and seek instructions. It is also heard that He Chengjun will go to Shashi within a few days to inspect the 21st Army, represent Chiang Kai-shek to offer condolences, and return in one or two days, then go to various counties in the central Hubei area to inspect and cooperate with Xu Yuanquan in supervising the suppression of the Red bandits.

<p>Because Han Has Remarks Discrediting the Kuomintang</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After Xia Douyin took office as the Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, he specially established the Provincial Administration Design Committee, employing more than 50 scholars and celebrities to discuss and deliberate on civil affairs, finance, construction, and education, preparing for government adoption and consultation. The committee was formally established on June 25. One of the members, Han Yucheng, a former National Assembly member from the Politics Studies Clique, gave a speech at the conference, in which he said, "In the past, the Kuomintang did not allow the people to speak. The Kuomintang members are too uncultured. They have no solutions themselves and do not allow others to have solutions, leading to bandits everywhere, harming the country and the people. This is all the root of the disaster left by Sun Yat-sen. Now the Kuomintang is not responsible. They can only destroy, and they want us engineers to build. We look at it inside the house and think it is very good, but the countryside is full of murder and arson, and the people are living in misery. The cities are extravagant and dissolute, and the powerful officials are tyrannical. The Kuomintang's proposition, only the eight characters of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace are correct, but this is also our proposition for many years." As soon as the speech was finished, there was a reaction in the hall. A faction of committee members questioned the reasons, and some even demanded that Han leave the meeting, but there were also those who defended Han. The two sides debated for a long time. The next day, committee members Qiu Bohang and others reported to the provincial and municipal party headquarters. Both party headquarters believed that Han's remarks were discrediting the Kuomintang and insulting the Kuomintang leader. Therefore, they convened a temporary emergency meeting on the 29th and decided to ask the provincial government to remove Han from his position. At the same time, they sent a letter to the bandit suppression headquarters of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and the Hubei Pacification Commissioner's Office, requesting them to arrest him strictly, and said that most of the design committee members were corrupt and evil elements, and decided to request its cancellation. After hearing the news, Han sent a letter to Xia Douyin and the members of the provincial government on the 30th, saying, "My colleagues recommended me to give a speech. Touched by the scene, I repeatedly sighed at the instability of people's hearts and the degeneration of the world. This heart and this will can swear to heaven and earth. Unexpectedly, the virtuous ones in the party have misunderstood. I have exhausted my foolish sincerity, but it has brought the burden of great fame. I earnestly request permission to dismiss my position as a design committee member, so as to avoid blame." Attached to the letter was the speech record of the day.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned remarks considered reactionary have not been deleted, but the meaning is more euphemistic, the theory is deeper, and the logic is more comprehensive. After receiving the letter, Xia immediately replied, approving his resignation, saying, "Brother, because of a misunderstanding of words, you are eager to retreat far away. Your skill in preserving your spirit is profound. I admire you very much. I respect your intention and dismiss you from the position of member of the Hubei Provincial Administration Design Committee," and so on. Today (30th) morning, Chairman Chiang read the newspaper and learned about the situation, and was greatly enraged. He immediately called the provincial government, instructing them to supervise Han Yucheng strictly. Yang Zaichun, the secretary-general of the provincial government, received the call at 1 p.m. and immediately crossed the river to consult with He Chengjun. After returning to Wuchang, he arrested Han in the evening and awaited further instructions.</p>
<p>Attached is Han Yucheng's own record of his speech: "Today, the officials and gentry of Hubei gather together to sit and discuss the reforms of Hubei. I am very pleased. In the past six years, the National Government and local governments did not allow the common people to speak about political facilities. Now the gentlemen of the Hubei Provincial Government are humbly seeking advice from everyone about the design of the provincial administration. Their broad minds are really admirable. Chairman Xia just said that we should seek construction for the welfare of the people, of course, including farmland, water conservancy, industry, commerce, and mutual assistance. I would like to add one more point: material design is important, but how to design the spiritual, which is invisible and formless? That is, the so-called cultivation. All achievements flow from cultivation. Only with great and magnificent cultivation can there be great and magnificent achievements. Tranquility leads to far-sightedness, and what is inside manifests outside. This is an unchanging principle of ancient and modern times. The policy plans of the National Government often change and often shake. The laws and regulations announced by various agencies are like hairs. What was right yesterday is wrong today, and the country is at a loss, resulting in the loss of the center of gravity of politics and society. The world is in turmoil and cannot be governed. The reason for this is that it places too much emphasis on material design and neglects the spiritual aspect. Therefore, it is sometimes slow and sometimes urgent, sometimes left and sometimes right, and there is no fixed direction for reforms. The frequent changes of those in power are a major reason, but the wavering of spirit is the main reason. Spiritual instability will inevitably lead to a lack of mastery in the heart. A lack of mastery in the heart will inevitably lead to a shift with the environment, unable to control the environment. Therefore, those who quelled great turmoil and cleared thorns in the past did not necessarily make rituals and music or lay out tracks, because the principles of ceremonies, cultures, and plans for governing the country are profound and the matters are extensive, which cannot be handled in a rush of war. In the times of Wen Jing and Kang Qian, many people of the past dynasties or hermits in the mountains and forests were sought to fill the task of making laws, probably because their minds were clear and their cultivation was pure, so they were always successful. Otherwise, if one relies solely on material design, thinking that it can benefit the country and the people, look at the Krupp factory in front of us. Its design can be said to be complete, but because it is obsessed with military power and force, it has evolved into an unprecedented tragedy in Europe, and as for the country being broken and the family destroyed, it has become a laughingstock in the world. What is the value of the Krupp factory? Mr. Zhongshan's eight-character training says: Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace. This is truly a priceless plan for our spiritual cultivation. All material designs must be produced from these eight characters to be truly called design. One can win the world on horseback, but one cannot govern the world on horseback, which is the principle of emphasizing both strength and virtue, rectifying people's hearts to rectify the world, and cultivating oneself to pacify the people. It sounds very common, but it is indeed not easy to do. Look at the surroundings outside the auditorium. What is the scene? Everywhere there is murder and arson, making everyone unable to live in peace, and even having to join the bandits, because the spirit is frantic and involuntary, and the inner heart loses the power of control, and many evils outside are born from this. We should all bear the mission of transforming people's hearts and strengthening the spirit, and do it step by step. Therefore, after Chairman Xia's speech, I would like to add one more point, and I hope you will forgive my arrogance." (June 30)</p>
<h3 id="e79">The Mystery of the Northeast K <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>(3) The Key to Creating the Greatest Necessity on the New Continent (1) The Northeast, which is about the size of Germany and France combined, was occupied by the Japanese army in less than three days. There are naturally many reasons for this ease, but the transportation agencies, especially the railways, have long been controlled by the Japanese, which cannot be denied as the most relevant fact. Therefore, to study the Northeast issue, we must take the railway as the backbone.</p>
<p>Using economic means to destroy a country is the most wonderful way to kill people without bloodshed. Isn't today's South Manchuria Railway Company the incarnation of the former East India Company? For the past twenty-five years, the power of the South Manchuria Railway Company has been deeply rooted in the Northeast. The Manchuria-Mongolia New Five Routes are the branches and leaves that have grown from this main line. The Japanese hope to blossom and bear fruit there every day, realizing the so-called "Third Phase of the Meiji Emperor's Plan," to conquer China by destroying Manchuria and Mongolia, and to conquer Asia and the world by destroying China.</p>
<p>(2) From the phrase "South Manchuria State," one can imagine the magnitude of the South Manchuria Railway Company's business scope. In addition to its own business, it includes mining, iron smelting, oil refining, port construction, shipbuilding, warehousing, hotels, shipping, industry, electricity, gas, and even geological surveys, agricultural experiments, veterinary research, urban management, sanitation, education, security, water supply, industry, commerce, and various facilities, almost all-inclusive. From an organizational point of view, the Japanese can control the Northeast, and it is more appropriate to say that it is the success of the South Manchuria Railway Company than the success of soldiers and vagrants.</p>
<p>The purpose of the South Manchuria Railway Company has now been largely achieved, but in order to further expand its business scope, it has decided to increase its capital by 360 million yuan to become 800 million yuan. In October of this year, 20 million yuan will be collected first for the use of new projects, and the remainder will be raised in ten years or less, depending on the urgency of the need.</p>
<p>The new projects of the South Manchuria Railway Company that have been announced include the following:</p>
<p>(1) In order to develop Manchuria and Mongolia, the company's Economic Committee will cooperate with the Japanese government to conduct an economic survey of the resources of Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>(2) In order to avoid public attention, the company's affiliated businesses and various affiliated companies, such as South Manchuria Gas Co., Ltd., South Manchuria Electric Co., Ltd., Dalian Industry Co., Ltd., South Manchuria Hotel Co., Ltd., Manchuria Shipyard Co., Ltd., Fushun Coal Sales Co., Ltd., Dalian Steamship Co., Ltd., and Fuchang Labor Co., Ltd., will be formed into a special company to make them independent.</p>
<p>(3) In order to revitalize the Manchuria-Mongolia trade with Japan, in addition to the trade halls that have been established in Jinzhou, Jilin, Dunhua, Harbin, Sanxing, Qiqihar, and Ning'an, it has been decided to add trade halls in Fuyu, Taonan, and other places.</p>
<p>The Japanese government, imitating the precedent of annexing Korea, intends to establish a Manchuria Governor-General to unify the political power of the Northeast. Therefore, the various benefits granted to the South Manchuria Railway Company in the past must be greatly weakened and changed into a purely commercial agency. The president of the company, Yasuya Uchida, has been appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and this plan will probably be realized soon, and Uchida's advocacy of recognizing the puppet state is what we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>(3) After the September 18 Incident, regarding the railway, the Japanese first took over the Northeast Transportation Committee, appointing Ding Jianxiu as the chairman. If any employees of each route resigned, they were replaced by Japanese. Otherwise, Japanese employees were added. At first, they were called counselors, but later they felt that there was no basis, so they changed to the name of liaison officer "trustee." They intervened in everything, large and small. Later, the puppet Ministry of Transportation was established, and Ding was still appointed as the puppet minister. The Northeast Transportation Committee was abolished on March 25.</p>
<p>The puppet Ministry of Transportation has four divisions: General Affairs, Railway, Postal Affairs, and Water Transportation. The Director of the General Affairs Division is Okayika Chikao, the Director of the Railway Division is Shigeyuki Morita, and the Director of the Postal Affairs Division is Yasuaki Fujita. Okayika Chikao is the stationmaster of the South Manchuria Railway Changchun Station. It is conceivable that the ministry's affairs are entirely in the hands of the Japanese.</p>
<p>The puppet Railway Division is divided into General Affairs, Road Works, Management, and the First to Fifth Sections. The First Section manages the Jichang, Jidun, and Jihai lines, the Second Section manages the Sitao, Taoang, and Qike lines, the Third Section manages the Fengshan and Panhai lines, the Fourth Section manages the Huhai line, and the Fifth Section manages the Chinese Eastern Railway. The organization is extremely peculiar.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the puppet Ministry of Transportation, it held the so-called "National Railway Conference" on May 1. The issues discussed were roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Improving the joint transportation methods and unifying the timetable of the Fengshan, Shenhai, Jihai, Jidun, Jichang, Chinese Eastern, Taoang, Sitao, and Qike lines.</p>
<p>(2) Rectifying the waiting rooms of each station and increasing all facilities.</p>
<p>(3) Improving the hotels and restaurants at each station and the vending departments in the cars.</p>
<p>(4) Expanding the road protection guard and increasing the road police accompanying the car.</p>
<p>(5) Arranging the seats in each train and paying attention to the hygiene in the car.</p>
<p>(6) Cracking down on road staff and foot traffic, and not allowing them to deceive passengers and demand extra money.</p>
<p>In order to prevent attacks by volunteer troops and bandits, the Japanese stipulated that photography is not allowed in the railway area, and tall crops such as sorghum and corn are not allowed to be planted within 1,600 feet on both sides of the railway. Miscellaneous people are not allowed to stay on the platform. In the past, the roads promoted tree planting, and looking out from the car, the green and blue were intertwined. Today, the Japanese are afraid that volunteer troops or bandits are hiding in them, so they have cut down almost all of them, turning them into barren scenes, which can be said to be a great disappointment.</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly control the road affairs, in addition to transferring students from the South Manchuria Railway Training Institute, a car service training school was set up to train low-level road staff, and a police officer school was set up to train road protection leaders. In addition, because the train telegraphs on each route are now changed to Japanese, a sound machine training school was specially set up to train station announcers. The lecturers are all hired by the South Manchuria Railway Company, and the salaries are extremely high. It is also foreseeable that the Northeast road affairs will be completely Japanized.</p>
<p>The various routes in the Northeast used to collect educational surcharges for supplementary education, and there were regulations on discounted fares for immigrants and free transportation of agricultural tools to promote colonization. Now, all of these have been cancelled by the Japanese, which shows that the Japanese only implement their due policies and do not care about the interests of others. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Trial of the Construction Bureau Chief's Embezzlement Case: Wu Junyu, the chief of the Kunshan County Construction Bureau, embezzled more than 10,000 yuan in road construction and donations. He was reported to the county party headquarters, and after the headquarters investigated and confirmed it, he was immediately transferred to the judiciary for handling. County Magistrate Cheng detained Wu in the county government to await interrogation. On the afternoon of the 30th, at 2 p.m., the county government summoned more than a dozen foremen who built the Kuntai Road for a trial. Chen Chengyi interrogated the foremen first. According to their statements, our receipt for the payment was completely forged by Director Wu. Wu Junyu was then interrogated, and he claimed that it was done by Su Hairuo, the absconding chief of the General Affairs Section. Chen Cheng, the trial officer, stated that the case had been revealed for more than a month, and the director was still allowing Su Hairuo to abscond with the money. Now they all claim that it was done by Su. Such denial is extremely illegal and he was ordered to be returned to prison to await sentencing.</p>

<p>The Construction Bureau Strictly Controls Construction in Townships: The construction control in the urban area of the county has been implemented long ago, but it has not been possible to send personnel to handle the construction in the distant townships. The owners have not reported for surveying, and the Construction Bureau also has insufficient staff to dispatch, so it is difficult to take into account the construction control in the townships. Now the bureau has decided to start construction control from July 1 in the four major towns of the county: Sijing, Fengjing, Tinglin, and Xinzhuang. The district office will send personnel to survey and approve the construction nearby, and issue reports to the Construction Bureau for uniform handling. If there is important construction, the bureau should still send personnel to survey and verify it.</p>

<p>The Case of Killing Police Officers and Police: Four bandits were drinking tea at the Longquan Teahouse (mistakenly reported as Ruyi Teahouse yesterday) near the Nan Yun Bridge outside the Ximen of Wuyi at 7 a.m. on the 30th. After being secretly reported, Assistant Officer Zhao Wei led the police to arrest them. Unexpectedly, the bandits opened fire and resisted arrest, shooting and wounding Zhao Wei and the police officer Hou Jichun on the spot, who died one after another. The bandits immediately fired their guns all the way and fled to Xicang Bridge, where they shot and wounded a police officer, Li Dianyi. At 6:20 p.m., Li died of his injuries. After being examined by the court prosecutor, the coffins of the three were all parked at Guangfu Temple outside Ximen for a memorial service in the future. Officer Zhao Wei was scheduled to be buried at 10 a.m. today (1st). After the bandits escaped, Chief Fang of the Public Security Bureau telegraphed the waterway and land police forces and ordered all bureaus to strictly arrest the perpetrators. At 10 a.m. on the same day, the bandit Wu Yuhai (from Shantou, Guangdong) was arrested half a mile west of Lianjiang Bridge west of Xinzha. At 12 p.m., the Qishuyan police force intercepted Zhang Zikun (from Guangxi) and Yang Yan (from Jiangxi) near Dingyan Pingqiao. When Zhang and Yang were captured, they were sitting in rickshaws. All three were soldiers. They were escorted to the Public Security Bureau that night and questioned by Chief Fang. Wu Yumei confessed that Zhang fired the gun at Longquan Teahouse, while Zhang's confession was vague, only admitting that he was eating tea with Yang upstairs. The shooting was done by the companions who escaped. The three criminals were ordered to be detained temporarily. In the deep night, the owners of the Changfa and Changxing inns where the criminals were hiding were also interrogated. It was also heard that a total of three police officers died in this battle. Officer Zhao Wei was 29 years old, a local, and had not yet married. Officer Hou Jichun was 23 years old, from Henan. Li Dianyi was 37 years old, from Beiping. They died heroically in this anti-burglary act.</p>

<p>A Shocking Report of Human Life Killed by Feces and Filth: Wu Yunxiang, a resident of Luoshe Town, Wanan City, the 16th district of the county, worked as a train guard. He married a wife, Qiang, who was beautiful but extremely fierce. Therefore, the villagers called her "Sai Daji." Yunxiang had a younger brother named Shengxiang, who worked in Zhejiang. He married a wife, Ding, who was gentle. Qiang saw that she was weak and often bullied her. On the afternoon of the 27th of last month, Ding went out for something and returned home, and saw that the waist door was slightly ajar. When she reached the room, she noticed that three chests and cages were missing. She immediately questioned Yunxiang, saying that he should not have left the waist door ajar, causing the thief to visit and suffer this loss. Before she could finish speaking, she provoked Qiang's anger. Qiang immediately instigated Yunxiang to beat and poison Ding severely, and forcibly poured waste matter into Ding's stomach. Because Ding closed her lips tightly, they used sewing needles to stab her lips randomly. Immediately, blood flowed like a torrent, and her breathing was short. Then, she fainted and became unconscious. By the afternoon of the 30th of last month, she died of serious injuries. After hearing the news, Ding's father was extremely sad and indignant. In addition to urgently telegraphing Ding's husband, Wu Shengxiang, to return to his hometown, he went to the county court yesterday with the various chiefs to report and request an examination to redress the injustice. However, Yunxiang and his wife had already carried 100 yuan in silver and 4 dou of white rice when Ding was critically ill and absconded without a trace in the deep night.</p>

<p>Aurora University held its academic year closing ceremony yesterday morning and awarded various diplomas and certificates. Guests included Mayor Wu's representative, Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, French Consul General Meyrier, Bishop Gu of Yichang, and several dozen others. First, Director Xu delivered a speech, offering encouragement to the graduating students. Then, Principal Sang and the French Consul General delivered speeches successively. Diplomas and certificates were then distributed. A total of 64 students graduated from the high school department. A total of 150 students from the Law School and the Polytechnic Institute received certificates or diplomas. Forty students from the first and second years of the medical school received certificates of completion. Students in the third and fourth years had served in the wounded soldier hospitals in Shanghai and Zhenru Suzhou during the Anti-Japanese War for a considerable period. As they had not completed their credits, the graduation examination would be postponed until September. It is heard that the school will hire Hu Wenyao, the former Dean of Studies of the Sino-French Engineering College, as the president starting next semester. Hu is also an alumnus of the school.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Notes from an Old Temple Bell (40) <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Zhai Fu, who doesn't remove the courtyard grass</p>
<p>44. Why did Mr. Zhu rush into the city like that? This is quite a guess. But I firmly believe that Mr. Zhu will definitely come back. He didn't bring his little brother into the city with him, how could he not come back?</p>
<p>Sure enough, in the red light of the setting sun, Mr. Zhu came back, and we were overjoyed. Mr. Zhu also had a friend with him. Through his introduction, we knew that this friend was a retired military officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said, "Zhong'er! Go to the village and greet everyone, saying that I have a good way to prevent bandits. Anyone who has a gun at home, please come to the meeting with your gun when you hear the bell." What a good news this is! The village couldn't wait for me to ring the bell, and everyone came rushing without even having dinner. Those with guns came proudly, and those without guns also came to join the fun. I was wrong, they didn't come to join the fun, but to know how to prevent bandits! In fact, I didn't need to ring the bell to gather everyone, because everyone had already arrived before the bell was rung. But I had to ring the bell as promised. Strange! Tonight's bell sound is particularly loud, which makes people feel a hundred times more courageous.</p>
<p>The main hall couldn't accommodate everyone, so we had to gather on the open space in front of the ancient temple. Mr. Zhu said, "I have considerable sympathy for the heroes forced to go to Liangshan. But even being a robber should have a reason. Robbers who kill children are unprincipled robbers. Children are our God, and we must fight against robbers who kill children. The robbers may come tonight! The child they want to kidnap may be the baby you are holding in your arms. There is only one way to prevent the robbers from coming. Those with guns should unite and obey a commander-in-chief for emergency combat! I have invited my friend Battalion Commander Jiang to teach you. We don't want to learn the military formalism of standing at attention, marching, and turning around. What Battalion Commander Jiang wants to teach you is how to fight in a battle. Suppose robbers come to kidnap our children at 10:00 tonight, or imperialists come to dig up our ancestors' graves and seize our beautiful mountains and rivers, how should we learn in these three or four hours to resist one against a hundred? Good, let's learn to defeat imperialism by defeating the robbers. Now, please ask Battalion Commander Jiang for guidance."</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Jiang: "I don't want to teach military formalism, and I don't want to say polite words. There are four hours left before the robbers come, what should we do? (1) Light up torches to learn target practice. Everyone should first learn to aim and take turns firing three bullets. If there are few bullets, firing one bullet is also acceptable. (2) Learn to load and disassemble guns. (3) Learn emergency assembly. (4) Divide those with guns into two teams, one team playing robbers, and the other team playing the self-defense group, learning offensive and defensive field battles."</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Jiang said and immediately lit torches to start. After learning the four items that night, guards were assigned to take turns guarding the night. The password is the two characters "Yue Fei." Those who don't know the password cannot pass. Thus, the entire village entered a state of martial law. Every strong man became a selfless warrior, and the kind of fearful and uneasy terror that was once felt had long disappeared.</p>

<h3 id="e93">A New Era for Wimbledon: British and American Players to Meet in Final for Championship <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Shields Eliminates Crawford｜Austin Defeats Sato Greatly. London, 30th – The Wimbledon Tennis Championships will usher in a new era in its 55-year history. British and American players will meet in the final to compete for the championship. After Mrs. Moody defeated Miss Heeley today, the men's singles quarterfinals followed. The results are listed below:</p>
<p>Six to two</p>
<p>Vines (US) Six to one Crawford (Australia)</p>
<p>Six to three</p>
<p>Seven to five</p>
<p>Austin (England) Six to two Sato (Japan) Six to one</p>
<p>Vines' victory over Crawford, a complete embodiment of Tilden, was so easy that it was astonishing. Today's performance was a complete embodiment of Tilden. Austin's outlook isn't as optimistic. When Vines took the court, his attack was like a fierce tiger. Crawford completely lost the power to resist. Prince George of England, Lady Mary, and 20,000 spectators, many of whom have come to watch the games every year since the European War, all said that they had never seen such a fast and fierce smash as Vines'. Crawford served first and immediately lost a game. Vines won the second game with four aces. In the first two sets, Crawford's net touches and major mistakes occurred repeatedly. In the third set, Crawford entered a better state, but was still controlled by Vines. With the final point, Vines won with an unstoppable serve. The ball bounced straight onto the grandstand.</p>
<p>Austin Shows True Ability Austin's defeat of Sato keeps Britain on the tennis map. The intermittent drizzle this afternoon made the court exceptionally slippery. Austin slipped five times and later wore felt over his tennis shoes. Sato started well and won three consecutive games, then led five to two. Austin, at this point, had subdued the slippery court and immediately rallied, winning five consecutive games to win the first set. The next two sets were even easier, leaving Sato nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Two Helenes to Compete for Title Today Mrs. Moody's victory over Miss Heeley was quick and Mrs. Moody didn't use her full strength. The game was over in half an hour. Heeley was gripped by fear, retreated everywhere, and lacked variation. Although she had some amazing returns at times, the two American Helenes will hold the final on Saturday.</p>
<p>Mixed Doubles Situation Changes Again The most promising mixed doubles team, Vines and Mrs. Moody, forfeited their match to Hopman (Australia) and Miss Sigart (Belgium) in the semifinals due to schedule conflicts, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>(1) Hopman (Australia) def. Vines (US) (Forfeit) Sigart (Belgium) Moody (2) Kehrling (France) Six to three Andrews (New Zealand) Hitting Six to eight Stringham (England) Six to four Lady Stammer (England) (3) Miel (Spain) Six to four Spence (South Africa) Miss Leydoux (US) Seven to five Nathol (England) (4) Brugnon (France) Seven to five Crawford (Australia) Mathieu (France) Six to three and lady</p>

<h3 id="e95">A Pitiable Reflection on the Past and Present of Shanghai's Chinese Baseball <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Once Won Two National Championships, But Where is the Glory Now?</p>
<p>Now There are Comets Appearing, the Sports Association Should Vigorously Sponsor Them</p>
<p>Shanghai is the center of sports in our country. Various sports have their own special spirit and strong interest. However, baseball, lacking promotion and practice, is declining, and there is a trend of extinction. The reason is that there is a lack of funds and talent, and those who are responsible for promotion also take it lightly and do not encourage it. In the past few years, occasionally several people went to the China Baseball Field to practice, but due to their immature skills and lack of encouragement, they disappeared.</p>
<p>Recalling the past of the Shanghai baseball community, there were considerable achievements. In 1926, the National Regional Baseball Championship was held. At that time, the South China team was unable to attend due to an incident. Only the North China and East China teams competed in Shanghai for the championship. As a result, East China won two consecutive games and won the championship. Since then, the interest in baseball in Shanghai has become more and more intense. The public has also gradually paid attention. With the promoters having enthusiasm, the players also felt more and more excited, and the baseball movement saw a vigorous atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1928, Shanghai organized the China Baseball Team, recruited talents, and worked hard to train. The skills improved even more than before. They participated in the Shanghai Foreign Baseball League. There were five teams participating. Although the Chinese team could not defeat the Maisner's Races and Paines teams, the wins and losses of each game were often within one or two points. Moreover, they were able to defeat the well-known amateur team and the naval team, ranking third. During the competition, it caused a sensation in Shanghai, and the spectators were enthusiastic. In addition to the foreign league, there was also a junior baseball league, with teams from Chinese Yi, Jewish, American Public School, Shanghai Jiang and John's and Tongwen schools participating. This was the most prosperous time for the baseball community.</p>
<p>In the same year, in addition to participating in the Shanghai Baseball League, the China Baseball Team also led its troops south to Hong Kong at the end of August to compete with the South China team, the originator of baseball in China, in the National Regional Baseball Championship. At that time, the rising Shanghai baseball team surprised everyone and was invincible. The first game with South China ended in a 3-3 tie. Due to the late hour, it could not be finished. South China won the second game with 5-4. Shanghai won the third game with 5-0. Shanghai won the fourth game with 9-5. Thus, they were crowned champions and regained the title of National Baseball Leader. In Hong Kong, they also competed with various strong foreign teams. Shanghai won every game and returned triumphantly.</p>
<p>Shanghai baseball was just beginning to show its potential, and its prospects seemed limitless. Unexpectedly, times changed, and the situation deteriorated day by day. The following year, talents scattered, and strength was greatly reduced. Although a few enthusiastic people shouted loudly, no one responded, resulting in a gradual decline.</p>
<p>In 1930, there was still no new atmosphere. The Sports Advancement Association also gradually became indifferent and did not revitalize it. Last year, Zhang Guoxun, Li Baojun, Liu Dacheng, and other heroes of the Shanghai baseball community shouted loudly, intending to reorganize. They also realized that without a stable organization in the baseball community, it would be difficult to develop the cause. Therefore, they initiated the organization of the Shanghai China Baseball Association to divide into teams for practice and promote skills. At that time, there were fifty or sixty people who joined. The founding meeting was held at the China YMCA on Sichuan Road, and the spirit was quite enthusiastic. However, it soon disappeared invisibly, and there were no achievements to be said. Full of enthusiasm turned into nothing.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the rise and fall of the Shanghai baseball community is truly regrettable. What can the enthusiastic baseball fans in Shanghai, the sports instructors of various universities, and the Sports Advancement Association do to comfort themselves and others?</p>
<p>Time flies, and the racecourse is full of enthusiastic popularity again. What will happen to our country? The China Baseball Field is covered with green grass, and no one comes. Is it not a pity? The Sports Advancement Association should at least bear a certain responsibility.</p>
<p>In this bleak and deserted Chinese baseball community, two comets have suddenly appeared, with great ambitions, intending to revitalize Shanghai baseball. It is hoped that the Sports Advancement Association and other enthusiastic baseball fans will vigorously sponsor them and work together.</p>
<p>Who are they? They are Liang Fuchu and Liang Chengshong from the Yokohama Chinese Sports Association. This time, they were angered by the violent Japanese invasion of China and returned to the country. They are now living in Shanghai and plan to gather baseball comrades to reorganize the China Baseball Team to promote the cause. Liang Fuchu is nearly forty years old and was the former supervisor and catcher of the Yokohama Chinese Baseball Team. Liang Chengshong is the second baseman and center fielder, both of whom are proficient in this field and enthusiastic about this cause.</p>
<p>The two Liangs will contact famous players in Shanghai such as Zhang Guozhu and Li Baojun to gather the players and organize a team to engage in training. This is truly a ray of dawn for the Shanghai Chinese baseball community. Liang hopes that enthusiastic people will respond and rise up, making the twilight sports community and the dying baseball community like the rising sun in the east, emitting a beautiful and brilliant light. One cannot help but offer heartfelt prayers.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>People fear fame, pigs fear fattening – this is an old saying. In fact, not only do people fear fame, but places also fear fame. A place that is not usually well-known suddenly becomes bustling and lively, which must mean the place has become a war zone! In recent years, Changxindian in the north, Huangdu in the south, and Miaohang, the most resistant to Japan, have all been in the news; however, when a place becomes famous, the people there suffer!</p>
<p>Changxin hardships become a war zone, Huangdu becomes a war zone – these are all historical stains; only the battle of Miaohang is a war against foreigners, a war to preserve the nation, and it carries considerable historical honor.</p>
<p>Lingdingyang, Lingdingyang – although this term is not well-known in the world, it has an enduring memory in the history of the Southern Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>"Since ancient times, who can avoid death? Let me keep a loyal heart shining in the pages of history." Is this not a line from Wen Tianxiang's poem as he passed through Lingdingyang? Wen Tianxiang, holding this loyal heart, wanted to restore the Song Dynasty; his war was a war against foreigners, a war to preserve the nation; these two rousing lines of poetry added much color to Lingdingyang.</p>
<p>Now, war has broken out again in Lingdingyang. Using the planes of our Republic of China to bomb the warships of our Republic of China! The warships are also using the anti-aircraft guns of our Republic of China to shoot down the planes of our Republic of China! Of China's army, navy, and air force, only the army is usable: as for the others, the navy is not a navy, and the air force is not an air force. Patriotic youths are shouting to expand the navy and expand the air force, but unexpectedly these few bits and pieces of the navy and air force still want to play this trick, playing it until they all perish together before they are willing to stop!</p>
<p>The water in Lingdingyang sobbed and said: Wen Tianxiang's honor to us has all been bombed away by this intense gunfire and bombs.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Spirit of Tseng, Tso, and Peng in Governance <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Bicheng</p>
<p>Reports indicate that during the Lushan Conference, Chiang delivered a speech emphasizing the need to change our mindset and emulate the spirit of Tseng, Tso, and Peng in governance to rectify the prevailing atmosphere and strive for improvement. Our nation's malady has reached a critical stage. Prescribing this remedy is undoubtedly appropriate. However, there is a saying in society: "Speaking of a true prescription, selling fake medicine." Even if the prescription is correct, if the medicine is fake, it cannot bring about a revival. Finding a good prescription is still possible, but obtaining genuine medicine is a greater concern. I will now elaborate on the authenticity of the medicine, even if it seems verbose. We must first understand the origin of the spirit of governance possessed by wise and outstanding individuals in the past. It did not solely rely on innate talent. It was the result of cultivation. Firstly, they read ancient books and elucidated the great principles. Secondly, they received instruction from wise fathers and elder brothers at home and earnest counsel from good teachers and friends outside. Thirdly, they regarded all forms of entertainment, wealth, and profit that could bewitch or ensnare them as venomous snakes and fierce tigers, avoiding them as if fearing to be too slow. With sufficient cultivation in these three aspects, upon entering governance, their spirit would naturally be abundant and invigorated because they were wholeheartedly devoted to the public good of the nation and its people, unburdened by selfish desires. Possessing such integrity, their ability to influence would naturally be strong. Their generals and subordinates would encourage themselves. An atmosphere would arise where civil officials did not covet money, and military officers did not fear death. The learning of Tseng, Tso, and Peng can be summarized in one word: diligence. Tseng often said that one should learn from those who surpass oneself and compare one's circumstances with those less fortunate. During his time in the capital, he benefited from a group of Confucian scholars like Wo Genfeng and Feng Shutang, meticulously recording their every word and action in his diary, striving not to deceive himself and rigorously self-improving (as seen in "Tseng Wenzhenggong's Family Letters"). When Tseng recommended Tso, he praised him as being resolute, wise, enduring hardship, and understanding military strategy. When he recommended Peng, he praised him as being steadfast, persevering, and possessing the spirit of ancient martyrs (as seen in "Tseng Wenzhenggong's Major Events"). After Tso's marriage, he lived with his wife's family, but soon sought independence. In his self-authored epitaph for Madam Zhou, he wrote, "Ashamed of not being self-sufficient, I requested a room in my mother-in-law's western house for separate residence" (as seen in "Collected Essays of Dunbi"). Peng's father served as a patrol inspector in a certain county in Zhejiang. He accumulated a modest salary and entrusted a relative to purchase land in Hengyang. After his father's death, the relative embezzled the land. Peng was still young but determined to seek revenge. His mother dissuaded him and encouraged him to be self-reliant through diligence (as seen in "Biography of Madam Wang, Mother of Peng" in "Collected Essays of Dunbi"). These examples demonstrate that their virtues were forged through diligence. The best medicines grow in the mountains, requiring many years to develop deep roots and potent properties. When harvested and used, they are naturally effective. Nowadays, most medicines are planted in shallow soil and quickly grown with fertilizers. They may appear beautiful, even surpassing the materials grown in the mountains over many years. However, when used to treat illnesses, they are found to be ineffective, and the disease becomes incurable. Lately, when I observe worldly affairs, I often think of the saying "Speaking of a true prescription, selling fake medicine" and sigh deeply. Government officials likely have experienced the harm of fake medicine and will hopefully awaken in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Ramblings on Lychees <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>In the midst of summer, lychees are the most treasured fruit. Their shells resemble red crepe, their membranes are like purple silk, their flesh is like white fat, and their sweetness is like sweet wine. No wonder a concubine smiled brightly at the sight of a rider bearing them through the red dust. A guest who was familiar with lychee varieties described several names, all with exquisite taste. Some lychees are named for their similar fragrance, such as "Hundred-Step Orchid" and "Musk Box." Some are named for their similar shape, such as "Ox Heart," "Ark Shell," "Scarlet Persimmon," "Tiger Thorn," and "Pine and Cypress Fortress." Some are named for their season, such as "Half-Ripe," for its lovely crimson color. Among the red varieties are "Square Red," "Official Red," "First-Rank Red," "Tortoiseshell Red," "Top Scholar Red," "Household Manager Red," "Zhou Family Red," "He Family Red," "Autumn Champion Red," "Double Seventh Red," "Star Ball Red," and "Longevity Red." For their pleasing green hue, the green varieties are named "River Green," "Green Leaf Fragrance," "Green Kernel," "Mid-Autumn Green," and "Green Robe." Others, such as "You Family Bundle," "French White Stone," "Large Wax," and "Small Wax," display magnificent colors. Volcanic lychees come from Southern Yue, and Fengting Post lychees come from Xinghua, both known as superior varieties. Those that ripen in June are called "June Honey," and those whose flesh resembles crystal are called "Crystal Kingdom." Those that hang in pairs are called "Hui Garden," and those with tiny kernels are called "Burnt Kernel." Other names include "Phoenix Offering," "Dragon Contending Jar," "Forget-the-Child," "Hairpin Bead," "Eighteen Maiden," "Large Eggplant," "Double Silk," "Golden Thread," and "Chicken Leading Child," totaling seventy-five varieties, too numerous to list. I said, "Hearing your talk for one evening is better than tasting ten thousand lychees." The guest smiled. Tonight, I hastily write this.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Restore the Pre-January 28th Status! <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Long Sao</p>
<p>During the day, one cannot see horse-drawn carriages fully loaded with bedding; at night, one cannot hear the roaring of murderous sounds cutting through the sky. The music and images of a city filled with terror and turmoil no longer enter the eyes or stir the hearts of everyone. Everything has returned to a peaceful Shanghai, having washed away the blood and swallowed the tears. Even the broken walls and rubble of Zhabei and the desolate wastelands of Wusong are now separated into another century. All the silver cafes of mysterious arts are again filled with proud youths, and the sounds of leather boots and pairs of black shadows have increased on the sidewalks where the moonlight flows like cream.</p>
<p>In the grassy fragrance of the slanting setting sun, on the green lawns of the parks once trod upon by wooden clogs, Chinese young gentlemen and fleshy misses linger, gazing into each other's eyes and touching lips. How can falling leaves disturb their rosy dreams?</p>
<p>In white houses surrounded by night, there are black-haired heads moving in the reflection of the screen, and the songs of the amusement parks generally have a large clientele who know how to appreciate them. Cars on the roads, foreign money in the shops, and even the Eastern Bookstore have all returned to the state before January 28th.</p>
<p>Therefore, must we thank the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement for giving us such great comfort and the selfish pleasures of every habit?</p>
<p>The demon of war has fled, followed by our own search for good fortune to indulge ourselves. What a "good fortune" it is, leading us into a forever-deepening dream, while awaiting the coming of another war in which we are bullied because we cannot save ourselves!</p>
<p>A curse on the wisdom of the Shanghai people!</p>
<h3 id="e103">Prevention of Epidemics <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>The plum rains drip, and new moss grows on the walls. It is midsummer. Epidemics are heard of in Shanghai. Since the Battle of Shanghai, the dead have piled up. Lao Tzu said, "After a great army, there will surely be a year of famine." Indeed, war is a fierce and dangerous thing. With many corpses accumulating, epidemics arise from this. After the Taiping Rebellion in the late Qing Dynasty, epidemics were rampant in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After the rebellion in Hunan the year before last, epidemics also occurred, with death filling the roads. It was truly a great calamity. Zeng Guofan's "Record of the Xiang Army Memorial Shrine in Nanjing" states, "Our army was stationed near Yuhuatai. Before long, epidemics broke out. Brothers fell ill, and younger brothers were infected. They laughed in the morning and stiffened in the evening. After one man died, several accompanied him to the burial. By the time they returned, half had perished on the way." Now, in Shanghai, epidemics have occurred very early after the war. This is also a natural consequence. Now, in the midst of summer, the weather is inconsistently cold and hot, and the air is humid. This is most conducive to the breeding of germs. Once they spread rapidly, the disaster will be no less than war. Alas, for our poor people, the great calamity is not yet over. This is a cause for great concern. There are many charitable organizations in Shanghai. Burying corpses, disinfecting, and preventing epidemics are not tasks for strangers. Giving injections of preventive medicine, providing medicine, and sending doctors are also urgently needed. If the people of the country are eagerly seeking to escape the calamity of war but do not pay attention to the arrival of epidemics, how can it not be dangerous? The method of prevention is nothing more than injecting cholera serum. Also, eating garlic often has a preventive effect. Maintain clean food and drink, exercise the body, do not enter restaurants or playgrounds, do not sleep outdoors under the stars and moon, bathe frequently, sweep and clean often, isolate patients, and disinfect objects. All of these are simple, common sense, but they are effective prescriptions for preventing epidemics. (Note: People who contract epidemic diseases should be sent to the hospital for treatment. Saline injections, etc., are very effective. The various "Ten Drops Water" remedies popular in the market cannot cure genuine cholera. Flies are the sole medium for spreading germs. Therefore, food must be covered to prevent flies from gathering. Also, do not eat spoiled food from the previous day.)</p>

<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>It is said that there is a woman in Madurai, India, who is the wife of an Indian weaver. She is thirty years old this year. She has not eaten a drop of water or a bowl of rice for thirteen years. Therefore, people in society pay very close attention to her. Although she has not eaten for thirteen years, her body appears to be very healthy. She has also raised three children. Her story can indeed be compiled into an interesting book. The local officials have recently visited her. It is said that once she was returning to her parents' home from her husband's house, but she suddenly collapsed and fainted on the way. She was later sent to the hospital. She stayed in the hospital for two weeks before returning home. At that time, the doctors used all sorts of methods to make her open her mouth, to make her speak, and to make her eat, but all were ineffective. Her body remained healthy. The doctors had no way of knowing why she fainted and would not speak, so they had to send her back. But after two years, one day she suddenly started talking. Now she helps her husband with household chores at home, but she still does not eat.</p>
<p>Following the marriage of Jiang Menglin and Ms. Tao Zenggu, all eyes were upon them, and it was much discussed; commentators also had mixed opinions. According to reports, Tao was originally the wife of Gao Renshan and was a remarriage; Jiang had been divorced. The wedding ceremony was very simple. Jiang's report highlighted the point that he had "struggled out a path of life from the obligations of love." Hu delivered a speech expressing great admiration for their courage, saying that it "could represent a symbol of an era of change." This tone is quite thought-provoking. Our publication has recently obtained a portrait of Jiang and Tao, which we reproduce below.</p>

<p>But in leisure, he began to think about this assigned task. How could he accomplish it? Now, holding this empty document, he felt lost and without a clue, unsure of where to start. An Yutian was becoming frantic. Who knew that Liang Xiaoyun's prediction would be accurate? As long as he could secure the title, there would always be people eager to latch onto his coattails, offering advice and support. Among these people offering their services, the most helpful was Liu Yuncai, the chauffeur who usually drove him and his wife. Working for a car rental company, he knew many clients in military and political circles. Councilor Hu Shide had also ridden in his car, so he knew that the things both parties were handling had the same location. He introduced Wu Jinlu to cooperate with An Yutian. The two hit it off immediately, like fish in water and a tiger with wings. Wu Jinlu was resourceful and planned for An Yutian to start in Haiding County. With him as an assistant and guide, recruiting many people would be extremely easy. An Yutian had no choice but to rely on Wu Jinlu at that time, so he naturally agreed. He left Liang Xiaoyun at the hotel in the provincial capital and personally went to Haiding County with Hu Shide, Wu Jinlu, and others early in the morning. Among the group, only Hu Shide had other official business, bringing a servant with him, forming a separate group. The rest were all An Yutian's subordinates. The hotel clerk recommended a relative, Zhu Qihong, to come along and prepare to be the quartermaster. The chauffeur Liu Yuncai also aspired to change careers and applied to be the adjutant. He also spent money to buy two box cannons and brought the tea server Wu Shihai and the old servant Wang Ding, disguising them as armed orderlies. They rehearsed in advance like acting in a play, calling An Yutian Commander An. Wu Jinlu orchestrated from the middle, linking the An and Hu sides into one, and also presided over all matters, appearing as a chief of staff. That night, they stayed at the Changxing Hotel, sleeping until noon the next day before getting up together. Suddenly, the shopkeeper Qin rushed in to find Wu Jinlu and reported, "Master, a strange thing happened this morning. Magistrate Li abandoned his post last night and fled!" To know why this person fled, see the next installment.</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to the closure of all Chinese and foreign banks, the financial market felt a decline. Only the money market remained open, but transactions were quiet. The interest rate for foreign currency at the morning session was 6 qian 8 fen 8 li, a small decrease of 3 hao 7 hu and a half compared to the previous afternoon. The afternoon session was the same price. Transactions for remittances at the morning session were 375,000, and in the afternoon only 140,000. Markets for banknotes and silver coins did not open. The exchange rate for silver was exceptionally soft. Yesterday, both sessions were priced at 4 fen. Transactions for exchange tickets were over 5 million. Bank collections were closed as usual without news. Collections from money houses and foreign companies were 4.3 million. Silver company collections were 21 million. Remittances from various routes were over 300,000. Small money house transactions were over 500,000. Jiangnan small foreign coins improved by 5 li, totaling 6 qian and 5 li, with 3,000 jiao traded. The afternoon session had no transactions, so the price was the same. Guangdong small foreign coins were 5 qian 8 fen 1 li and a half in the morning and 5 qian 8 fen 2 li 3 hao and 7 hu and a half in the afternoon.

<h3 id="e107">Summary of Mid-Year Situation <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The impact of the war: much less than in previous years. Yesterday was the end of June, which is also the middle of the year. The situation seems much bleaker than last year. February and March of this year were entirely during the wartime period. The commercial strikes to resist aggression and the sluggishness of business were expected. From April to June, there was a gradual recovery, but only for a portion of foreign merchants, which seemed to have improved. On the Chinese merchant side, although there was much more activity on the surface than during the strike, the desolation after the calamity made recovery difficult. Silver and money industries were extremely strict with lending, unable to flow as desired. Therefore, the results of this mid-year closing are far from the prosperity of last year. However, foreign banks are also affected by the economic panic in major foreign ports and cannot be considered a completely prosperous era. However, with collections and settlements of 12 to 13 million, and various foreign exchange items of 6 to 7 million, and cargo pledges of 10 to 20 million, they are still much more prosperous than Chinese merchants. Among them, the entry and exit of Japanese merchant banks account for about 30%. As for the Chinese merchant side, bank collections, excluding settlements of 4 to 5 million and exchange pledges of over 1 million, are only about 30-40% more than usual. The silver dollars from money houses are only 10-20% more. This year, money houses are not making large-scale transactions, which is well known throughout the city, so it is appropriate that the amount is limited.</p>

<p>The New York stock market on Thursday was the opposite of the previous day. Most stocks fell by several points to one point. There was more selling pressure in the market because many stocks did not have much confidence in their current dividends. Volume was still only 600,000 shares. "General Motors" stock continued to fall, but it stabilized slightly at the close. Supporters of U.S. Steel stock were numerous and were able to withstand the pressure. According to a report from New York, the stock exchange will be closed this Saturday and next Monday, so there will be no market during those days. The Dow Jones Index is attached as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market has become firm, with a strong upward trend. The rise in raw cotton has stirred up sentiment. General retail investors are short, and the market is tightening. However, factories are still hedging. As for sales of spot yarn, intentions in the southern ports remain strong.</p>
<p>Renbiao Rises Strongly by 3 Taels: At the opening of the Renbiao market, American cotton rose, and sellers were scarce. Prices for all months rose by 2 taels 5 or 6 qian. In the afternoon, prices for all months rose again by 9 qian to 1 tael 3 qian, but major traders were still selling. The total volume of transactions for the day was 54,400 bales. Rongxing sold 1,050 bales, Yiyu sold 1,100 bales, Xincheng sold 1,900 bales, and Long sold 800 bales.

<p>American cotton has risen for two consecutive days. The local standard cotton market was stimulated by this. Rumors have been circulating in the market for many days that there will be no deliveries for the near-term contracts. With the help of American cotton, sentiment has moved a step further. General short sellers, seeing the strong bullish sentiment, have had to cut their losses. The market has risen sharply. However, major traders such as China Cotton Company and Xincheng are still hedging. Cotton merchants and brokers in Shanghai are increasing their purchases significantly, so the near-month market is becoming increasingly tight. Actual sales in the market still do not have significant development.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Rises Sharply by 1 Tael 7 or 8 Qian: At the opening of the Zheng Biao market, due to American cotton rising for two consecutive days and weak shorts, prices for all months rose by 1 tael 2 or 3 qian. In the afternoon, the near months rose another 5 qian, and the far months rose 2 or 3 qian. The total volume of transactions for the day was 143,600 dan.

<p>South Shanghai: Few merchants from various groups come to Shanghai, totaling only five or six. Trading on this street is even more active, and sentiment is upward. Prices have increased by another 2-3 jiao. Early and late rice goods are scarce, and prices continue to harden by 2 chi. Foreign Dujian sales are rare, and the market follows suit. Bianyuan's appetite is weak, and the situation is mediocre.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Supply is scarce, and the market on this street is more prosperous than the previous market. Fresh Changzhou and Xiguan goods are traded the most, with a profit margin of 3 jiao. Zhuang and gang merchants in the Kunshan and Jiangyin rice villages are slightly active, following the trend by 1-2 jiao. Early and late rice separate sales are slightly active, and the trend is tightening. Bianyuan market sales are also active.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Inland Merchants Absorb Long-Term Flour <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market: After the opening in the morning, the market for each month was generally stable and fluctuating. Foreign wheat quotations were slightly lower by about 1 jiao, so the opening price was flat. This month had reached 1 liang 7 qian 8 fen 2 li 2, but after the second session, due to the cessation of factory selling, customers' intentions seemed to be good, and market sentiment seemed stable. By the close, it had returned to a looser state. Until the afternoon opening, the near-term was still flat, and the far-term was rising. The inland merchants absorbed quite a bit, mainly because the bottom price was cheap. Many people felt they were doing speculation, so the opening price was going well. On the factory side, only Fufeng slightly released documents, and the rest did not move. Therefore, the rise in the long-term was very strong. As a result, July increased by 7.5 li compared to the previous day's closing price, August increased by 1.5 fen, and December has been opened as usual. The initial price was 1 liang 8 qian 6 fen, followed by a small 5 li, and by the close, it was finally good 7.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e116">期 Wheat Delivery Clearance Market Stable <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market: After the opening in the morning, the market for each month was generally stable. Although foreign wheat quotations were slightly lower by about 1 jiao, because the bottom price was already cheap and there were few shorts, and the current wheat inventory was abundant, sales were scarce due to identity issues and non-compliance with the standard. However, with this situation, trading was less. Until the afternoon opening, the current month had no trading, and the long-term was stable and slightly rising. However, prices in the production area are still loose, and standards are difficult to rise excessively. As a result, August increased by 2 fen compared to the previous day, and September to November each increased by 1 fen. The spot wheat market is stable, and the supply is continuously strong, and the factory appetite is still active. Kaitang wheat opened at 2 liang 8 qian 8 fen, Hengjing wheat was 2 liang 8 qian 3 fen, Kunshan wheat was 2 liang 8 qian 2 fen, Anding wheat was 2 liang 7 qian 8 fen, Lujiabang wheat was 2 liang 7 qian 6 fen, Penglai wheat was 2 liang 8 qian, and Shuangfeng wheat was 2 liang 7 qian 8 fen, totaling more than 2,300 packages.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Sudden Surge in Rice Sales <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Over 20,000 Bags Sold in the Market: Price Increase of Several Cents Yesterday, the rice market suddenly showed signs of tension. After the market opened in the morning, local dealers were initially active, followed by inquiries from inland merchants from the northern Yangtze River region and scattered rural households. In addition to Tianjin merchants, Yantai merchants newly entered the market, purchasing over 2,000 bags. Confidence grew, and a total of over 21,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice were sold throughout the day, with prices ranging from 9.65 to 9.75 yuan. Medium-grade rice sold for 9.60 to 9.40 yuan, a significant increase of several cents compared to the previous day. 1,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were sold, with prices ranging from 11.25 to 11.10 yuan, also an increase of over several cents. 300 bags of Wenzhou unpolished rice were sold, with prices rising sharply to 8.80 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Recent Tea Market Reports from Anhui and Jiangxi <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Wuyuan Zi Tea Sales Active, Prices Rise Due to recent demand from various firms and favorable weather, mountain farmers are eager to avoid losing profits on the trees and are hurriedly picking and processing tea. The tea itself has a beautiful color and taste, so firms that were previously indifferent to Zi tea are now paying attention to it. On the 22nd and 23rd of last month, market prices increased by seven to eight yuan compared to the previous two days. Retail prices for mountain farmers range from three to five cents per pound. Farmers, encouraged by the rising tea prices, are hiring workers to help with picking in hopes of increasing production. Tea merchants are also actively searching for and purchasing tea day and night, driven by the potential for profit.</p>
<p>Tunxi Tea Purchases Becoming Scarce Due to the difficulty in raising market prices in recent weeks, the supply of tea from distant areas to Tunxi has been weak. High-grade tea from established firms has seen some recent demand, but prices remain low. Low-grade tea from Anhui, even with prices falling to 22-23 yuan, is rarely sought after. Furthermore, the lack of price increases in the Shanghai market for Zhen tea, with Tunxi tea selling for only 90 taels, has further shrunk the demand for stored tea. In addition, firms have substantial tea reserves from previous purchases, with some holding over 1,000 dan, others 600-700 dan, and the least holding 200-300 dan, sufficient for current production. They are unwilling to increase purchases unless the Shanghai market improves.</p>
<p>Fuliang Zi Tea Sales Brisk Due to the abundant spring tea production this year, tea firms had initially decided to halt Zi tea purchases based on discussions in Shanghai. However, mountain farmers, finding no market with foreign firms, turned to local shops as an alternative outlet. Farmers from various southern villages in Japan are diligently picking, processing, and transporting tea to shops in Jingdezhen, where it sells for three catties per yuan. Shop owners, attracted by the good quality and low prices, are eager to purchase, resulting in a situation where demand exceeds supply.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Trends Remain Firm <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Market is Buzzing with Activity Yesterday's market assessment by the Sugar Merchants' Association showed active trading and strong market sentiment. High-grade Dutch sugar No. 24 raw white sugar was traded at 14 taels and 2.5 mace, with strong demand. Ordinary sugar also fetched the same price when sold directly from households, but there were fewer buyers. Hong Kong sugar sold for 14 taels and 0.05 to 0.075 tael, showing a positive trend. No. 14 raw red sugar sold for 11 taels and 9.5 mace, with brisk trading. Taikoo sugar B mark sold for 16 taels and 2 mace, CW mark for 15 taels and 8 mace, DY mark for 15 taels and 5.5 mace, HX mark for 15 taels and 3 mace, HM mark for 14 taels and 9 mace, and PX mark for 11 taels and 1.5 to 2 mace, with active trading and a firm market outlook. The Zhenxiang firm offered 500 bags of Hong Kong raw white sugar at 14 taels per yuan. The Xiangyuan factory sold dozens of large bags of local crystal sugar at 15 taels and 4 mace, a very popular price.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Oil Market: Tung Oil Trade with Foreign Firms Slightly Active <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Internal Sales Hampered by Plum Rains Tung oil sales to foreign firms have been slightly active recently. Since the Juxingcheng firm in Hankou sold 150 tons at 17 taels and 7 mace according to foreign standards, other foreign firms have also engaged in some trading, ranging from dozens to hundreds of tons, with similar prices. According to recent shipments, southern branch oil is offered at 14 taels and 4 mace, and Sichuan tung oil at 15 taels and 4 mace, both according to customer standards. Hankou firms wholesale for domestic sales at around 14 taels and 4 to 6 mace. However, domestic sales have not been strong due to the ongoing plum rains. Hankou's inventory is not particularly large, and with continued foreign sales, the situation is increasingly stable. Therefore, despite weak domestic sales, there is no possibility of lower prices. If domestic sales become active after the plum rains, a bright outlook can be expected. Local firms are continuing to purchase oil, but only to meet immediate demand due to normal sales volumes. They do not seem to be paying attention to timing, and their inventories are not large.</p>

However, starting at midnight the night before last, workers at Feng Cunren Hall medicine shop suddenly announced a partial strike because their demands for bonuses were not met. The labor unrest has intensified and may escalate. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Strike The workers at Feng Cunren Hall, citing low wages and difficult living conditions, submitted a request to manager Feng Jinpu the day before yesterday, asking for bonuses to be issued. Manager Feng considered the workers' demands unreasonable and refused to accept them. As a result, all the workers were indignant and believed that the shop was the first to violate labor-management conditions. Having now refused the workers' demands, over fifty workers collectively left the shop and declared a strike after midnight the night before last, and immediately organized a strike committee to direct everything. They also reported to the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union for assistance.</p>
<p>Letter to All Sectors The Feng Cunren Subgroup of the Second District Branch of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union issued a letter to fellow workers and all sectors, declaring a strike. It stated: "To fellow workers and all sectors, the city's pharmaceutical industry has recently experienced labor disputes due to labor-management conditions. Our workers are united in protecting the conditions and fighting to the death for them. While these negotiations are underway, we hope that all fellow workers will work together with a unified stance. There should be no individual actions, but the rapid changes in the situation are unexpected. With the consent of all members of the Wood Subgroup this morning, we have implemented a departure from the shop to prompt our employer to reflect. Therefore, we announce the reasons, facts, and preconditions to all sectors and all fellow workers to clarify the truth. The employer of this shop has always been a strong member of the Pharmaceutical Merchants' Association and a champion of oppressing fellow workers in this industry. Feng Cunren, Cai Tongde, and Ye Tiande were the first to violate labor-management conditions. After the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union sent letters of warning based on the resolution of the delegates' meeting, the employer knew that it would be difficult to respond and asked the Merchants' Association to respond on its behalf, shifting responsibility to the Merchants' Association rather than the shop's own actions. It should be known that before the Merchants' Association notified all shops to reject external substitutes, the shop had already refused to send them. After receiving the warning from the Workers' Union, Cai Tongde and Ye Tiande had successively complied, but this shop did not. Moreover, other violations of conditions, such as relying on large bonuses (falsely claiming that there were few profits and not opening the accounts for inspection), are all violations of the conditions. After several negotiations, they have not awakened at all, but instead treat the workers in this shop as enemies, resorting to scolding at every turn. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? They even rely on the military force of imperialism to bully fellow Chinese of the same weak and small nation, thus provoking the public anger of all the workers in this shop. In order to cope with the environment, we had to leave the shop entirely to show our determination, while rectifying discipline and organizing a strike committee to deal with the employer of this shop individually. We hereby put forward two preconditions: (1) Substitutes shall be implemented as usual according to the contract. (2) Open the accounts and implement bonuses according to the contract. Other important issues, such as the overall violation of labor-management conditions, will be resolved by the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union as a whole. In addition to the problems of this shop, our colleagues will do our best for the three thousand fellow workers in this industry until the goal is achieved and we will never give up responsibility. We hope that all sectors and Wood industry workers will rise up and provide righteous assistance. We are extremely pleased."</p>
<p>Union Meeting The Pharmaceutical Workers' Union convened a special emergency meeting yesterday afternoon, attended by all directors and supervisors, as well as all members of the salary increase movement committee. Zhao Zhenhui chaired the meeting, and Zhou Dichun recorded the minutes. Discussions included: (1)...(2)...(3) Whether the Union should submit a request to party and government agencies. It was resolved to send Yuan Pinzhang, Chen Hezhi, Chen Yuantao, Zhao..., and Feng Xing... as representatives to go on the afternoon of July 3rd at 1:00 PM. (4) Whether to request assistance from the General Labor Union and various labor unions. It was resolved to send Yuan Pinzhang and the other four comrades to contact them. (5) Omitted. (6) Given the current dangerous situation, how to prepare financially if the strike is realized. It was resolved to levy a special donation on all members to prepare. (7) Secret. (8) Secret. (9) How should the Union respond to the Pharmaceutical Merchants' Association's proposal to form a joint committee to discuss and resolve this dispute? It was resolved that if the Association accepts the Union's preconditions, it will be supported; otherwise, it will not be involved. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<p>Merchants' Association Petition The Pharmaceutical Merchants' Association, after a resolution by the Executive Committee yesterday, sent standing committee members Zhang Meian, Cen Zhiliang, Zhuang Meitang, and others to petition various agencies with a written statement. They first went to the Municipal Government, where staff member Huang Yunshu received them and promised to forward the representatives' petition points to the mayor for review and action in accordance with the law. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau, where Section Chief Xu Yefu of the Third Section personally met them. After the representatives stated their petition, Section Chief Xu gave an important reply, stating that the Bureau attaches great importance to the current pharmaceutical labor unrest because of its profound relationship with society compared to any other labor unrest. He said that the root cause of the ups and downs of pharmaceutical labor unrest over the years lies in the imperfection of the labor-management contract. Therefore, the Bureau believes there are two ways to deal with pharmaceutical labor unrest: the symptomatic and the fundamental. Resolving the current dispute is the symptomatic approach. Reviewing the imperfections of the previous labor-management contract and having the government provide relief to make it conform to current laws and regulations, thereby facilitating compliance by both labor and management and permanently eliminating the source of all disputes, is the fundamental approach. The Bureau believes that for the sake of the permanent peace of society and the pharmaceutical industry, it should start from the fundamental aspects this time in dealing with pharmaceutical labor unrest. The Party Headquarters also holds this view, and so on. Later, they went to the Municipal Party Headquarters, where standing committee member Tao Baichuan received them. Tao's views were generally the same as those of Section Chief Xu, but he had a great deal of discussion with the representatives regarding the substitute worker system in the pharmaceutical industry. The representatives also stated their views as much as possible, and the representatives returned to the Association after a discussion until around 6:00 PM. From the above petition situation, it can be seen that the municipal party and government agencies have made concrete decisions on how to deal with the current pharmaceutical labor unrest. The labor unrest may not escalate for a while, which is good news for patients.</p>
<p>Merchants' Association Opinion The Pharmaceutical Merchants' Association believes that the most contentious issues in the four demands made by the labor side this time are substitute workers and placement. Therefore, the Association specifically expressed its views on the evolution of the substitute worker and placement systems in the pharmaceutical industry and the reasons why they should be abolished as follows: "The Shanghai pharmaceutical industry has never had so-called substitute worker and placement systems. They existed only from the 17th year of the Republic. In October of that year, the former Pharmaceutical Workers' Union proposed a labor-management agreement to the employer and made the acceptance of placing the unemployed a prerequisite for coercing the employer. At that time, the employer was under violent threats and, in order to take the overall situation into account, reluctantly accepted this harsh demand and placed 35 of the 116 unemployed workers in smaller pharmacies. The remaining 81 were used as substitutes in larger pharmacies. After this unprecedented bad example began, the Union again had more than 200 so-called unemployed workers and ordered the employer to place them all. Our employer believed that the Union's greed was insatiable and that the industry was in danger of collapsing, so it firmly refused to accept and vowed not to accept. Moreover, the employer had already completely resolved the problem of the over 100 unemployed workers last year, so how could there be so many unemployed workers again after only a few years? The source of these unemployed workers is ambiguous, which is already evident (the so-called unemployed workers this time are mostly unemployed in other cities and bribed the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Workers' Union to buy membership certificates and obtain illegal membership, or they work in small pharmacies in this city, are nominally unemployed, and hope to be placed in large pharmacies to obtain generous compensation. The identities are complex and cannot be investigated). How can the employer bear this undue obligation? Unexpectedly, the Union insisted on striking because its coercion was unsuccessful, lasting for 45 days. The employer almost went bankrupt, and society suffered all kinds of harm. Subsequently, the Central Executive Committee decided on a mediation method, the original order of which is as follows: 'The labor-management dispute in the city's pharmaceutical industry has been delayed for a long time and is very inappropriate. The Union (referring to the former Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Association) should be allowed to select from the 128 legally unemployed workers and introduce them to the employer for immediate employment of 50 people. As for the abolition of the substitute worker system, the 13 articles previously agreed upon by labor and management in the pharmaceutical industry have many inappropriate points and also conflict with the Trade Union Law. It should be resolved after the case is resolved, and the Trade Union should conduct investigations and studies and then submit them to the city's party and government agencies for proper revision to resolve and eliminate disputes. In addition to instructing the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and Municipal Government to investigate and handle the matter, please inform them.') At that time, our employer, relying on the Central Government's instructions, in addition to complying with the order to employ 50 people, also issued each unqualified unemployed worker a one-time travel allowance of 20 yuan to return home, and completely dispersed and resolved the problem. It was said that from now on, the problem of unemployment in the pharmaceutical industry should not be revived, and the substitute worker system should also be abolished. Unexpectedly, the Union has raised this old case of placement and substitute workers again today. There are substitute workers after there is unemployment. The problem of unemployment in the pharmaceutical industry has been fundamentally resolved again and again, so there is no substitute worker in fact. How can the Union force the employer to use this historically abandoned term and create unnecessary disputes? According to the Union's excuse this time, the source of the unemployed workers is said to have come from the impact of the January 28th Shanghai War. In this case, the January 28th War was a national disaster. The pharmacies in the war zone were either bombed or burned down. How much more did they suffer from the national disaster in terms of losses and sacrifices than the workers who only suffered from unemployment? If the workers who became unemployed due to the national disaster are ordered by the employer to bear the obligation of placement and employment, then may I ask to whom should the employer appeal for compensation for the losses and sacrifices caused by the national disaster? Moreover, the unemployed workers affected by the January 28th National Disaster are not only in the pharmaceutical industry. Why does only the pharmaceutical industry Union have to order the employer to place them, while other industries are unheard of? Moreover, according to the investigations conducted by the Association, the number of those who were truly affected by the January 28th National Disaster and became unemployed is indeed very small. The Union is only taking advantage of the opportunity to absorb a large number of unemployed members whose identities cannot be investigated by improper means, and is only provoking the employer to cause trouble. What is its intention? It is self-evident. The social Mingda, fortunately, pay attention to it."</p>
<h3 id="e124">Silk Mill Labor Unrest <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Summoned Both Parties Yesterday</p>
<p>Ordered to Attempt Reconciliation Out of Court within Two Days</p>
<p>Direct Labor-Management Negotiations Today</p>
<p>After the silk mill workers in the Hongkou district went on strike over wage issues, the unrest has spread to the Zhabei district. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned both parties yesterday to facilitate mediation and decided on three measures for labor and management to attempt reconciliation out of court. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Total Number of Strikes After the Yichang Silk Mill in the Hongkou district went on strike, it spread throughout the district, including Tongwei, Yujing, Yuncheng, Xiangcheng, Xinlun, Yuanfu, Weiyu, Tongyi, Renji, and ten other mills. In the Zhabei district, Ruifeng, Yuji, Jiuji, Fengtai, Shenji, Fuchang, Heji, Yuanji, Xieji, Jiufeng, Dingji, Yuanhe, Zhenxing, Renchang, Tongchangtai, Chengtail, and fifteen other mills have joined the strike. The situation is expanding, and the sub-bureaus, sub-stations, and police stations in the Fourth and Fifth Districts have been ordered to protect the silk mills and step up security to prevent thugs from taking the opportunity to infiltrate. Currently, excluding the seven mills in the concession area and the three mills in the Nanshi district that have not joined the strike, a total of 25 mills have joined, with over 15,000 male and female workers. As for the silk mill workers in the concession area and the Nanshi district, it is reported that party and government agencies have taken measures to prevent strikes.</p>
<p>Details of the Interrogation The Social Affairs Bureau summoned representatives from both the silk mill industry and the labor side at 1:00 PM yesterday to facilitate mediation. Shen....Chen, Zhu Jingan, Zhang Peishen from the Silk Mill Industry Association, Zhu Xizhang, Yue Xiaorong from the Fourth District Silk Industry Union, Zhou Lianze from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Yang Gengdi, Yan Aizhu from the Sixth District Silk Industry Union, and Yang Shumei from the Third District Silk Industry Union attended the meeting, chaired by Wang Shui, director of the mediation section of the Social Affairs Bureau. First, the labor side stated that last year's wages were set at 5.8 cents. After the war subsided, Yichang in Hongkou was the first to start work, unilaterally reducing wages to 4.2 cents, paid every ten days, starting work at 4:45 PM and ending at 6:15 PM. Later, Tongwei, Yujing, and other factories started work one after another, all following the Yichang method, causing workers to feel pain and request the Union to negotiate. After consultation with the Industry Association, the Industry Association agreed to advise the factories on working hours and completely rejected wage increases. Now, in order to be considerate of the factory's side and maintain a spirit of cooperation, the labor side has proposed a flexible solution: wages of 5.6 cents and two days of bonus per month. The employer side stated that the price of silk this year is 50% lower than last year. Although the government has provided relief and all exports are tax-free, it is still not sustainable. Only 32 of the 113 silk mills in the city are currently open, which proves the industry's recession. In addition, financial institutions are unwilling to lend after the war, making it impossible to start work. Yichang's wages were negotiated by both parties themselves. This time, the strike was instigated by a third party, and the cause and responsibility for the strike should be investigated. After repeated persuasion by the chairman, it was still ineffective. Until 5:00 PM, the chairman decided: (1) The labor and management sides should attempt reconciliation out of court within two days. (2) If reconciliation fails, party and government agencies will formally mediate at 1:00 PM on the 5th. (3) The labor unions in each district will be fully responsible for the order of the strike. Thereupon, labor and management both expressed their acceptance and dispersed.</p>
<p>Negotiations Today The labor and management sides of the silk mill industry complied with the instructions of the Social Affairs Bureau and agreed at 5:00 PM when they dispersed yesterday to directly negotiate a solution at the Silk Mill Industry Association on Beishan Road at 3:00 PM today. It is reported that the Silk Mill Industry Association has decided to send Shen...Chen, Zhu Jingan, the Fourth District Silk Industry Union will send Yue Xiaorong, Zhu Xizhang, the Third District Silk Industry Union will send Yang Shumei, and the Sixth District Silk Industry Union will send Yang Gengdi, Wu Suzhen, and Yan Aizhu to attend.</p>
<p>Union Meeting The Dagong News reports that the Fourth District Silk Industry Union convened an emergency meeting at the Union headquarters at 2:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Chen Xiupu and recorded by He Yin. The report included: (1) The wishes and demands of the striking workers. (2) Senior officials of the factory stated that they did not participate in the strike after the factory closed down. (3) The Social Affairs Bureau convened an interrogation. Discussions included: (1) Workers declared a strike because of the factory's harsh treatment. It has been six days since the factory publicly closed down and threatened the workers. How should the situation proceed? Resolved: (A) Submit a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. (B) Send another letter advising the employer. (C) Notify the workers to wait for the authorities to resolve the issue. (2) Senior officials of each factory publicly represent all workers and express their opinions, acting......in order to......Resolved: (A) Report to party and government agencies to explain that the officials have other intentions. (B) Send a letter advising the officials that they must not take any action without the consent of the Union. (3) Factories belonging to the Sixth District Union also went on strike yesterday. Should personnel be sent to investigate? Resolved: Send...Sheng and He Yin to investigate. (4) Should the application for mediation be jointly handled by the Sixth District and Third District? Resolved: Solicit opinions from the Third and Sixth Districts. If there is no solution, apply independently. (5) After the labor unrest occurred, the outside world did not understand the truth. How should the public be made aware? Resolved: Publish a declaration.</p>
<h3 id="e125">New Executive and Supervisory Committee Members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sworn in Yesterday <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The second session of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's executive and supervisory committee members held a swearing-in ceremony yesterday at 10:00 AM.  Those present included Executive Committee members Tu Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Lu Wenshao, Luo Qinghua, Zhu Wenqi, Bei Songsun, Chen Zeqing, Zheng Zeshang, Gao Shaoquan, Pan Xusheng, Yu Zuoting, Chen Yizhou, Ma Jiliang, and alternate Executive Committee members Xie Zhongle and Zhang Peizhen, totaling thirteen individuals.  Also present were Supervisory Committee members Wen Lanting, Lao Jingxiu, Chen Songyuan, Jiang Zhigang, Du Yuesheng, Fang Jiaobo, and alternate Supervisory Committee members Zhang Yichen and Wang Boling, totaling six individuals.  Representatives from higher-level organizations and various sectors included Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government, Tao Baichuan of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wu Huanru of the Social Affairs Bureau, Xu Yiheng and Lin Jin of the Garrison Headquarters, Hu Hongji of the Health Bureau, Cai Zengji of the Finance Bureau, Lin Kanghou of the National Chamber of Commerce Federation, Zhang Liucheng of the Navigation Administration, and over a hundred representatives from the Silk and Satin Trade Association, the Sugar Trade Association, the Shoe Trade Association, the Western Pigment Trade Association, the Clothing Trade Association, the Tree and Firewood Trade Association, and the Fresh Meat Trade Association. The chairman was Wang Xiaolai, the recorder was Wu Jichun, and the master of ceremonies was Zhu Boyuan.</p>
<p>The Swearing-in Ceremony Procedure included (1) Ringing the bell to commence the meeting, (2) All executive and supervisory committee members taking their seats, (3) Publicly electing a temporary chairman, (4) Giving the highest salute to the Party flag, the national flag, and Sun Yat-sen's portrait, (5) The chairman respectfully reading Sun Yat-sen's will, (6) All executive and supervisory committee members swearing an oath of office, (7) Remarks from higher-level organizations, (9) Addresses from various sectors, (9) Addresses from trade association representatives, and (10) Adjournment upon completion of the ceremony.</p>
<p>Oath of All Committee Members: We solemnly swear that, with utmost sincerity, we accept the trust of all members of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, abide by the charter, diligently serve, refrain from seeking personal gain, and not neglect our duties. Should we violate this oath, we are willing to accept the most severe sanctions from all members. We solemnly swear.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Remarks: Shanghai is the economic center of the country, and is closely watched by various nations. Its position is important, and it has become the center of all undertakings. Therefore, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce holds a leading position among commercial groups nationwide. Let us observe the current situation in China. Politics, society, the economy, and the people's livelihood are all forming a highly dangerous situation for China's future. Our country is known as a country with vast land and abundant resources, but now it has come to the point where the people are poor, the treasury is exhausted, and the future is uncertain. The root cause lies in political instability. All kinds of undertakings in the country are not able to develop freely, causing the people's livelihoods to suffer from political and accidental oppression. Therefore, if we want to solve the safety of the people's lives, we must work hard to develop the national economy and promote the development of industry and commerce in various regions. However, within a country, relying solely on industrial production without cooperation with the commercial sector rarely leads to success. In the past, the failure of our country's enterprises was mostly due to the lack of concentrated capital. For example, someone starts a factory, and in addition to focusing on manufacturing, they also have to devote themselves to raising funds and promoting sales. Therefore, the difficulty of the domestic industrial sector is usually due to the lack of capital flow and the accumulation of products, which are the biggest reasons. If commercial organizations in various regions can properly guide their members to coordinate industry and commerce, then the above-mentioned difficulties can naturally be eliminated. If we want to seek social stability, the first thing to do is to nourish the national economy. The driving force of the national economy depends on the development of industry. The development of industry cannot be achieved without the commercial sector making every effort to support and promote it. Today is the day of the inauguration of the new officials of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. You all bear a major mission for the revitalization of industry and commerce in this city. Tiecheng offers the above opinions and hopes to work with you to promote cooperation. Then,</p>
<p>Remarks from the Party Headquarters Representative: Today is the day for the swearing-in of the new officials of the second session of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Your election as members of the Chamber of Commerce can be said to be due to the respect of the city's merchants. In the future, work hard to promote commerce and seek the development of industrial and commercial undertakings. Today, I sincerely wish you success in the future. We know that merchants have always had a saying, "In business, speak of business." However, this statement is not a bad thing. Industry and commerce are the engine of a country's economy. If industry and commerce can develop, the country's economy can be enriched and the country's position can be consolidated. However, in addition to this, in the current situation where domestic politics have not yet been put on track, the national economy is declining, and social conditions are unstable, merchants, in addition to their own responsibilities, should stand in the position of the people and seek national freedom and equality. Because industrial and commercial economy is only a part of the national economy, we should dedicate ourselves to society and at the same time seek a comprehensive solution to fulfill our responsibility to the country. The current system of election and appointment of the Chamber of Commerce holds a new-old replacement every considerable period of time. In this way, talents are rotated, and the cause remains the same. The future results will be satisfactory. I hope that you will work hard.</p>
<p>Remarks from the Social Affairs Bureau: Shanghai is the economic center of the country and an important area of the world economy. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce was formally organized two years ago in accordance with central government laws and regulations. The members, such as the various trade associations, are all sound organizations. In the recent past, they have helped the government maintain local order and have done a considerable amount of work. This is something we should praise. However, after the sudden changes in the local area, the vitality has been greatly damaged. How to adjust industry and commerce in the future and restore prosperity, and all kinds of facilities, need to be properly planned. Today, the old members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are retiring and the new members are taking over and being sworn in. The responsibilities they bear are even greater than in the past. I hope they will double their efforts.</p>
<p>Remarks from the Commander's Representative: Today, I am participating in the inauguration ceremony of the new members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and feel a little bit of emotion. People say that China has a vast land and abundant resources, why can't it be rich and strong? I don't know the reason for this, because it is caused by poor politics and economic decline. A country, if it wants to be strong, must first have political power to the outside world. If political power is insufficient, then it must be supplemented by economic power. If both are prepared, then the country's position can be safely maintained. The reason why our country cannot join the international equal position and is bullied by the great powers is that it has not completed these two kinds of forces. In the past, we felt that the external forces were materially insufficient and that the guns were not as sharp as others. It was already like throwing eggs at stones, and it was inevitable that we would lose. In terms of economy, hundreds of millions of dollars are leaked every year, and we only feel that there is no way to make up for it. Since the 19th Route Army started to resist the violent Japanese with political power, it seems that we have given us considerable awareness. However, the use of political power is still based on economic power. Any changes in the world are based on economics as its background and its driving force. Only economy can transfer everything. If we want to save the country, we must have sufficient economic power. Just now, Mayor Wu said that we should work hard to develop industrial and commercial undertakings to enrich the country's economic strength. This is the urgent task of today. I hope that you will cooperate with the government and give the government the power of the people as a backing to resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Kanghou's Speech: I served in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce in the 16th year of the Republic of China, so I have a little understanding of the commercial situation in this city. But today, the situation of Shanghai's industry and commerce is declining and panic, which can be said to have reached the extreme. I remember that in the past, merchant groups did not talk about politics because their own organizations were not sound. Later, they felt that politics was not on the right track, and it was not easy to do anything well. So they began to ask about political issues. But for several years, the political variety has been on display, and the result is still fighting endlessly. Therefore, if we want to seek a way out for all undertakings, we should first stabilize domestic politics. Therefore, the anti-civil war movement that I recently advocated is our most important work. Although people have always appealed for peace whenever a civil war breaks out, individual actions have rarely been effective. Therefore, this time we are advocating the abolition of civil war, we must contact all parties, and we must first consolidate the organization of our own group, and not cause internal strife, and adopt various effective peaceful solutions to complete this task. So related to the hope that the Chamber of Commerce or branches, do not cause internal strife, then any future things are easy to cooperate, this is some of the ideas.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jie'an's Speech: After the end of the Shanghai War, although the military affairs have temporarily come to an end, the commercial war has continued. The economic strategy of the great powers has not diminished its ambition. We observe the imported goods on the market, and they are all dumped, almost to the point where our domestic products cannot gain a foothold. Chinese silk has always been the leader in the world, but now the domestic silk cocoon merchants are dying and have successively gone bankrupt. Looking back at Japan, it has spared no effort to promote it. This phenomenon is just like a soldier facing the enemy, not allowing retreat, while the Chinese merchants are in the final struggle on the commercial battlefield. Thinking about it, I can't help but feel vigilant. Today, the new members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are taking office. We merchants are still soldiers. From now on, we will wait for you to be in the position of officials, issue orders, stand on the same front, command us, and strive to attack, to embrace peace internally and resist to the end externally, in order to save a line of life for our country's industry and commerce. Finally, after the chairman made a reply of thanks, he announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>

<p>Mutual Election of Standing Committee Members At the same time, the first meeting of the second session of the Executive Committee was opened. First, five standing committee members were mutually elected. At that time, the representatives of the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters were all present. The ballots were counted by the two supervisors Fang Jiaobo and Lao. Wang Xiaohu was elected with twelve votes, Wang Yansong with twelve votes, Bei Songsun with twelve votes, Yu Zuoting with twelve votes, and Ye Huijun with eleven votes. Five people were elected as the standing committee members of this session. Next, one chairman was elected. The ballots were counted by the two supervisors Wen Lanting and Chen Songyuan. As a result, Wang Xiaolai was elected as the chairman.</p>
<p>Chairman's Remarks: Mr. Wang made an impromptu speech, saying that he dared not say anything when he was re-elected as chairman. He would only work hard with his usual fighting spirit to live up to the trust of all the executive and supervisory committee members. However, since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang and the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, he deeply felt that if he wanted to save the country, he should go to the mainland to do practical work. If this matter is realized in the future, he hoped that everyone would understand when he had to leave Shanghai.</p>
<p>Discussion and Resolution of Various Cases After the discussion, the receiving procedures were resolved. The Standing Committee will handle the receipt. The meeting then discussed the cases submitted by the Representative Assembly. (A) The budget deficit for the 20th year and the 21st year should be made up by increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. How to handle the case? It was resolved that the Standing Committee should properly formulate a plan and submit it to the joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees for discussion. (B) Organize a special committee to investigate and study the current accounting system of various industries. It was resolved that the Standing Committee should draw up a list of committee members. (C) Convene various industries related to silk and satin to properly formulate a plan to promote domestic silk in order to submit it to the government for adoption. It was resolved that the Standing Committee should convene a meeting on a regular basis. (D) Convene the Yinqian Liang Gonghui to properly formulate a plan to abolish the tael and change the yuan. It was resolved that the opinions of the Yinqian Liang Gonghui should be solicited first, and then reviewed and processed.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Russian Dies of Illness in the Detention Center of the Second Special District <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>French Concession Police Request to Hoist the Coffin for Examination</p>
<p>The Court Responds to Act According to the Agreement</p>
<p>A case of a Russian beggar, George Lati Lev, dying of dysentery in the detention center of the Second Special District Court on the 19th of this month. A portion of the foreigners in this city with ulterior motives took the opportunity to make an issue of it, so it was rumored for a while that the Russian had been beaten to death in prison. The French Concession Police also ordered an investigation, and in order to complete the investigation procedures, they sent someone to the Second Special District Court to request that the coffin be hoisted at the Tangwan Yizhongdi for examination. The court immediately stated that the court initially advocated opening the coffin for examination to clarify the truth. However, the court takes the law as its position, and all cases, no matter how small, must be carried out according to the law. The Russian was ill in prison, and there was already a coroner's report and a forensic examination report. The case had already come to an end. Later, the deceased's brother overturned the case and filed a complaint. However, the three Russians pointed out by the deceased's brother were questioned by the police one after another, and all denied witnessing George Lati Lev being beaten. Therefore, the evidence was insufficient, and the case could not be established. Under these circumstances, if the police are determined to examine the body, the court has no objection. However, it is necessary to determine who the plaintiff and defendant are in advance to clarify the responsibility. The police still need to send an official document. The French Concession Police sent an official document to the court the night before, requesting that the police be allowed to hoist the coffin for examination themselves in the name of investigation. The court stated that the right to examine the body belonged to the court's prosecution. The police hoisting and examining the body themselves violated Article 3 of the court's agreement. Therefore, this point is greatly related to China's legal rights and is difficult to accommodate. The court replied to the police yesterday morning based on this idea, so it is difficult to open the coffin for examination for a while. Xiao Jinfang, the secretary-general of the Second Special District Court, told our reporter yesterday that according to Article 3 of the court agreement, the examination matters should be handled by the prosecutor. However, in order to dispel the suspicion of foreigners, when the coffin is opened for examination in this case, the court intends to invite an international forensic doctor to conduct the examination together. The French Concession Police can also send another forensic doctor to participate at that time, in order to clarify the truth of this case. The news about this case is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>The Police Demand a Second Examination: Commissioner Faber of the General Investigation Department of the French Concession Police sent a letter to the Second Special District Court the day before yesterday, saying: "Sir, according to Si Meiweng Gelaji's claim, it is said that his brother, George Gelaji, died because he was beaten by an unnamed guard in the detention center. Based on this, a preliminary investigation has begun on the alleged perpetrator. In accordance with Articles 156 and 161 of the Criminal Procedure Law, it has been decided to appoint a committee to dissect the body, and Dr. Sandeli, a doctor from the French Concession Engineering Bureau, has been commissioned to handle this matter in accordance with Article 177. Detective Chief Xia Cai'er has also been commissioned to make a record. For this reason, I hereby request your court to inform the prosecutor to inform Tongren Fuyuantang that the body must be examined at the Taitelas Tuo Road Xujiahui Road autopsy site at 8 am on July 2nd. After George Gelaji's death, the coroner had already examined the body. If the prosecutor can ask the doctor to be present at the re-examination, it would be fortunate. The preliminary investigation will collect (1) the statements of the guards on duty in the section of George Gelaji's detention house when he was detained in the detention center, (2) the statements of the director of the detention center, (3) the statements of the doctor who treated the deceased, (4) the statements of the police officers who escorted George Gelaji, (5) other statements that can help to reveal the truth. The investigation will be conducted at the detention center at 10:35 am tomorrow (July 1st). To the Shanghai Second Special District Court, Faber."</p>
<p>The Court Rejects According to Regulations: After receiving the letter, the Second Special District Court, although it also hoped to clarify the facts as soon as possible for this bizarre case, and re-examine the deceased when necessary, the police's sudden request was not in line with the spirit of the agreement, and was fundamentally inconsistent with Article 4 of the agreement. Therefore, the original letter was submitted to the prosecutor's office, which rejected it with four points: (1) According to Article 4 of the agreement, whether or not to re-examine the body is the responsibility of the court's prosecutor's office. The police have no right to set a date without authorization, and fundamentally the time is too short and it is difficult to handle. (2) According to the police's settlement of the case, the deceased's original name was George Lati Lev. The name pointed out by the police now is George Grantki. The names are absolutely different. The police's settlement of the case stated that the deceased had no family, no wife, and no job, and made a living by begging. Now there is a sudden claim that the deceased's brother requested a re-examination. The court feels confused about the above two points. (3) In order to verify the truth of this case, the court may re-examine the body at the necessary time. At that time, the court will hire an international forensic doctor to be responsible for the examination. The police will be allowed to send personnel to participate.</p>
<p>The Police Begin the Investigation: Regarding the police's request to re-examine the body today, after the court rejected it according to reason, the police have not yet made any statement. However, the police's investigation procedures for this matter have already begun yesterday. At 10:30 am yesterday, the chief of the judicial section of the French Concession Police, accompanied by a recorder, went to the court to request to investigate the detention center. The court sent Secretary-General Xiao Jinfang to accompany them. The police investigated for an hour. All the detention center director Xu Rongwen, the medical officer Yu Minggao, and the detention center Ding were questioned one by one, and a detailed investigation was conducted in the detention center. In addition, the police authorities also interrogated Gao Faligao, a Russian who was released from the detention center the day before yesterday after serving his sentence.</p>
<p>Detention Center Director Xu Rongwen Spoke Strictly: When the police went to the detention center to investigate yesterday, the detention center director Xu Rongwen expressed his opinion on this matter frankly. However, after the police completed the investigation, Xu Rongwen asked the police, saying that when the police handed over the case to the court, the transfer form stated that he had no family and no job. After arriving at the court, the deceased also stated that he had no family and no job. Now, how can there suddenly be a self-proclaimed brother of the deceased? How can the police answer this matter? At that time, the police personnel could not answer.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Investigates Household Registration in the War Zone <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Population Reduced by More Than 800,000 After the War</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the household registration in this city has been extremely chaotic. Now, except for District D, where Japanese soldiers have not yet withdrawn, the rest have been taken over by the Municipal Party Bureau. The Police Bureau is deeply concerned that many undesirable elements may be mixed in. It has ordered the responsible district offices to re-register the household registration. The procedure is that the district offices or branch police stations first send household registration survey forms to each household, which are filled in by the households and sent to the district. The district then sends personnel to re-examine each household to verify the information and report it to the bureau. Now, the district offices are supervising their subordinates to actively carry out the work. Some of them have already completed the re-examination procedures, but it takes a lot of time to compile the entire statistics. It will take about the 20th of this month to complete the work. However, in the Zhabei District, because there are many Japanese residents, the bureau is responsible for public security and is also responsible for protecting the safety of Japanese residents in the city. Therefore, it should be investigated clearly. It has previously requested the Municipal Government to inform the Japanese Consul General to inform the Japanese residents in this city that they must comply with the regulations for registration. However, most of the Japanese residents still do not comply. Now, in addition to requesting the Municipal Government to make serious representations to the Japanese Consul again, we are still trying to proceed in order to complete the work as soon as possible. As for the number of households in this city, the survey conducted in December last year counted 397,859 households and 1,878,066 people. By April of this year, the number of households had dropped to 214,535 and the number of people had dropped to 1,056,113. The difference in the number of households before and after the war was 183,328, and the difference in the number of people was 821,953. This shows the huge losses suffered by the residents of this city in this war.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Yesterday's Hearing on the Arsenal Case <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Military Affairs Approves Searching for Land to Build a New Factory</p>
<p>The Gun, Bullet, Machine Gun, and Machinery Factories to be Built First</p>
<p>The New Factory Design Committee to be Established Soon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Arsenal's issue of whether to continue or be abolished has, after Shanghai factory employee representatives Hu Sihong and others went to the capital to explain the pros and cons in detail to the military authorities, now learned that the factory received a telegram from the Ministry of Military Affairs yesterday, approving the relocation to Zhejiang and the search for land to build a new factory. As for the abolishment of the factory, it has already been dismissed. The New Factory Design Committee will be officially established soon. A reporter from the Datong News Agency met yesterday with Mr. Lin Weirong, director of the gun and bullet factory, who had returned to Shanghai from the capital. According to him, regarding the issue of resuming work at the Shanghai Arsenal, Vice Minister Chen had repeatedly telegraphed Chairman Chiang and Minister He to request instructions on the methods. Subsequently, they received replies from Chiang and He, agreeing to the resumption of work at the Shanghai factory and moving back to the old site. It was resolved that the entire machinery be preserved and a site be selected for building a factory, which could be approved. On the afternoon of June 29th, Minister Chen summoned and inquired about all construction and land purchase costs, setting a budget of 500,000 yuan, which is currently being raised and must be completed quickly. The location for the factory has been decided on the upper reaches of the Qiantang River, a place surrounded by mountains on three sides and facing the river on one side. It is planned to purchase approximately 300 acres of land to first build the gun, bullet, machine gun, and machinery factories, and establish a new factory design committee. The committee members have not yet been determined, and it is expected that the Ordnance Department will announce them soon. The authorities previously had considerable reasons for dispersing the machinery of the Shanghai factory to various factories, which cannot be criticized harshly. However, comparing the pros and cons, preserving the entire machinery and selecting a site to build a factory can take into account both national welfare and people's livelihood, which is more beneficial. Therefore, they were able to resolutely accept our suggestions. All parties are very concerned about the issue of the Shanghai factory's existence, but many reports contain discrepancies, which can easily lead to misunderstandings. For example, the details published in a certain newspaper on June 30th are not factual. I am the director of the gun and bullet factory, and I am more familiar with the process of relocating the machinery of this factory than others. A few days before the retreat of the 19th Route Army, I was ordered to rush to transport all the machinery to Hangzhou. Before the start of transportation, I sent Xu Yanru, a technician from our factory, to Hangzhou to find warehouses, borrowing two large warehouses at the Zhakou and Nanxingqiao Railway Stations successively before we could start moving the gun and bullet machinery and storing them in the Hangzhou warehouses to avoid damage from wind and rain. All machinery was oiled and painted. To prevent tipping, it was not packed in boxes (except for parts, which were not tied with straw ropes either). The claim that hundreds of yuan worth of machinery at the Shanghai factory was rusted is not true. As for the previous dismantling of the Fujian Arsenal, I was also the one who went to dismantle the machinery, transporting three sets of gun and bullet machinery and other ordinary machinery. After more than a year of sorting, they have all been installed and used, and there are no raw materials included, so what loss can be said to have occurred? In my opinion, if the construction of the new factory is rapid, it will only take more than a month to install the machinery. After the entire operation is up and running, the bullets and other products produced can reach the previous numbers, with no reduction. If the machinery were really scrap iron, why would we be so eager to request resumption of work? However, the machinery has been idle for a long time, and although it has been oiled and protected, I am afraid that it will rust over time, causing obstacles to future work, and a major overhaul will be necessary. Therefore, we are now planning to re-organize it once beforehand, so that it will be easier to start installing parts in the future.</p>

<p>Also Telegraphed General Cai, Asking Him to Mediate Nearby. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Civil War League has telegraphed Chen Jitang twice regarding the dispute between the two Chens of Guangdong and Hainan, urging him to find another solution and not engage in internal strife. Chen has not responded.</p>
<p>News of fierce fighting has been coming in for days. As General Cai Tingkai is in Lingnan, the league telegraphed him, requesting him to mediate nearby, and telegraphed Chen again, urging him with righteousness. The original telegram is recorded below.</p>
<p>To Chen Jitang: Commander-in-Chief Chen of Guangzhou, With Respects, the previous telegram has not been replied to. War has broken out in Hainan, and a powerful enemy has entered our heartland. Yet, brothers are fighting each other. With your intelligence, how can this happen? Suppressing our indignation, we offer our sincere advice again. If you still have a sense of national and ethnic consciousness, please immediately stop this internal conflict and unite to resist foreign aggression. If you do not heed the warning of self-immolation, our people will eventually have a day of final judgment. Urgent and without delay, we hope you will adopt this. The Shanghai Anti-Civil War League Preparatory Committee kowtows.</p>
<p>To General Cai: General Cai Tingkai of Guangzhou, With Respects, We heard that you have arrived in Guangdong. The people of Lingnan admire your divine power. Seeing this internal strife amidst the battle in Hainan, your sorrow must be even more profound, given your image of resisting enemies. This league has sent two telegrams to Commander-in-Chief Chen, urging him to stop the war and find another solution. With your prestige, if you can strongly mediate and find a way to stop it, you will surely be able to save some vitality internally, which will add strength to resisting foreign enemies. We respectfully submit this telegram and await your command. The Shanghai Anti-Civil War League Preparatory Committee kowtows.</p>
<h3 id="e132">The Municipal Government Will Establish a Security Office <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>To establish a director and deputy director for the Shanghai Municipal Government, given the special local circumstances, a municipal security team will be formed, directly subordinate to the municipal government, to provide security. This has been repeatedly reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the municipal government believes that the security corps is also under its jurisdiction. To facilitate command, control, training, and management, a supporting agency is necessary to take special responsibility. It has now been decided to establish a security office. The office will have a director and a deputy director to manage affairs. Everything will still be done in the name of the mayor. Previous rumors that the mayor would concurrently serve as the director of the security office and that someone would be the deputy director are not true.</p>

<p>The Municipal Party Committee Intends to Reorganize the Labor Union</p>
<p>The Labor Union Reported to the Central Party Committee Yesterday</p>
<p>The labor strike at the Chinese-owned Electric Company in this city is intensifying, and the labor-management dispute is quite fierce. A huge storm is feared to break out. The various situations are described below:</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Committee Will Start Reorganizing the Labor Union. In view of the ongoing disputes in the Water and Electricity Industry Labor Union in the First District, it is heard that the Municipal Party Committee has decided to reorganize it. The members of the reorganization committee will be officially announced within days and are scheduled to summon the current executive directors of the labor union for talks today.</p>
<p>The Labor Union's Report to the Central Government: The labor union submitted a document to the Central Party Committee yesterday, stating, "We are reporting to request protection of the labor movement and punishment of the labor thieves and lackeys who undermine the labor union in order to maintain the interests of the masses and social stability. Our union has been established for more than seven terms. Unfortunately, in the seventh term, internal bad elements such as Zhou Guangrong, Zhu Hanhe, and Tang Junsheng seized control of the union affairs, oppressed the masses, entrenched themselves in the labor union, and colluded with each other. Externally, they used the name of the labor union to cheat and swindle, engage in private profiteering and embezzlement, and neglect union affairs. Internally, they engaged in private gain and corruption, using their positions as general affairs, accounting, and public relations officers to embezzle public funds, filling their own pockets with the money earned by our workers with sweat and blood. They disregarded their personal integrity and shame and the interests of the masses. In the past six months, union affairs have become increasingly neglected, and the organization has gradually collapsed. The masses have been forced to automatically convene a general meeting on December 21st of last year to announce the establishment of a temporary board of directors to dismiss those disruptive elements in the hope of reversing the tide and saving all the members from their predicament. It has been half a year since then. During this six-month period, the temporary board of directors has made repeated efforts to reorganize the union, and we were hoping that union affairs would gradually improve. Unexpectedly, Zhou Guangrong and others have lost all conscience, colluding with a small number of labor thieves to undermine our union with all their might. During this opposition to the oppression of workers by the car affairs director Zhu Shaoyi, they did not hesitate to recognize thieves as fathers and colluded with him to attack our workers. They sent their henchmen to spread rumors and exert their power to force workers to leave the union and undermine unity. The viciousness of their methods is indescribable. All the workers are in a dangerous environment of internal and external attacks, and they are all unable to bear it any longer, feeling deeply resentful and wanting to eliminate them. The disruption and oppression by Zhou Guangrong and others are becoming more and more intense. If this continues, a labor strike to drive out Zhou and Zhu will break out in the near future. The masses are indignant and cannot be stopped. We hereby request your committee to uphold justice and promptly investigate and punish Zhou Guangrong, Zhu Hanhe, Tang Junsheng, Zhu Shaoyi, and others who undermine the labor union in order to maintain party discipline and benefit the labor movement. We urgently submit this petition and await your command. Sincerely presented to the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. Attached are the criminal records of oppression of workers by Zhou Guangrong, director of general affairs, Zhu Hanhe, accountant, Tang Junsheng, public relations officer, and Zhu Shaoyi, director of company affairs, of the seventh labor union, and declarations of this union."</p>

<p>Zhang Hongdu Sued by His Own Daughter</p>
<h3 id="e134">Zhang Hongdu Sued by His Own Daughter for Alimony <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>A Father Has an Obligation to Support His Children</p>
<p>The Father's and Daughter's Joys and Sorrows are Vastly Different</p>
<p>Zhang Hongdu, a native of Ningbo, made his fortune in business and has assets of hundreds of thousands. Recently, his own daughters, Zhang Xiuyun and Baoyun, hired lawyer Zou Shengzu to sue him in the First Special Court for alimony. The lawsuit states that the plaintiffs are the biological daughters of the petitioner. Since their mother, Guan, was forced to divorce the defendant in 1926, it has been five years. Because they are raised by their mother, they have not been close to their father. In the past five years, the plaintiffs have been able to feed themselves mostly because of a sum of alimony that their mother received from the defendant, totaling 2,000 yuan. Now, it has long been used up, and she has no ability to make more money, so they are constantly in danger of going without food. They believe that a father has an obligation to support his children. The defendant, with assets of hundreds of thousands, lives in a luxurious mansion, wears fine clothes, eats rich food, and enjoys himself fully. He alone endures the fact that his own daughters live in a thatched house, wear ragged clothes, and eat rough food. Speaking of this painful situation, they cannot help but shed tears. Therefore, they request that the defendant allocate the following funds: (1) Living expenses of 20 yuan per person per month on average, estimated until the age of 20. Xiuyun is currently 12 years old and has eight years until she is 20. Baoyun is currently 6 years old and has 14 years until she is 20. The total is 22 years, and 5,280 yuan should be allocated. (2) Educational expenses from elementary school to university total 6,140 yuan. It is estimated that the above-mentioned amount of litigation costs cannot be handled without hundreds of yuan. The plaintiffs' mother is a woman and has no savings. In recent years, she has become increasingly impoverished and now lives in the Chinese area in a very small residence. Even in the midst of fierce battles and the sound of artillery fire, she cannot afford to evacuate and can only huddle in fear. The bitterness of her situation cannot be described in words. Therefore, they seek a guarantor and request that litigation assistance be granted and that litigation costs be temporarily waived. The court approved the request. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Lou Ying opened the court for questioning. The defendant, Zhang Hongdu, did not appear and appointed lawyer Tan Xinzhen to defend him. After Judge Lou's interrogation, he ordered that the questioning be rescheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Jealousy Murder Case in Moulin Street <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Cohabitation Led to Ambiguity</p>
<p>Jealousy Ignited Murder</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, around 1:00 PM, a young man was stabbed to death in Moulin Street in the French Concession. The details are described below:</p>
<p>The Circumstances of the Murderer: Zhang Ruihe, also known as Ah Gan, a native of Huizhou, is 35 years old. He used to run a Huizhou tavern. He currently lives upstairs from a fruit store on Dongxin Street in the French Concession and usually enters and exits through the back door of Shoulu Lane. Sun Guisheng, a resident on the third floor of the same building, is married to a woman named Zhu, who is in her late thirties and of loose morals. She has been cohabiting with Sun for nine years and has two daughters, one four years old and the other two.</p>
<p>Helping the Woman Defend Her Husband: Because Zhu lived in the same building with Zhang Ruihe, they developed an ambiguous relationship over time. Sun discovered this. Three days ago, the couple had a quarrel. At that time, Zhang even helped Zhu against Sun, eventually resorting to violence. As a result, they were all taken to the Datong Clock police station. After the police chief reprimanded them, the matter was dropped. However, the seeds of murder were sown.</p>
<p>Waiting with a Knife: Yesterday morning, Sun went to Pudong. He returned to Puxi at noon and went to rest at the home of a fellow villager at No. 65 Moulin Street on Avenue Edward VII. Before even a quarter of an hour had passed, Zhang also arrived. Seeing Zhang, Sun's jealousy flared up. He quickly went downstairs and waited secretly at the entrance of the Zhonghua Lane to the south. Soon, Zhang also came downstairs. Sun suddenly pulled out a three-edged knife and stabbed Zhang in the left waist. Zhang fell to the ground in extreme pain. The murderer took the opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>Died from Severe Injuries: After the incident, a Chinese constable from No. 65 saw it and picked up the murder weapon. He took Zhang to the police station and transferred him to Renji Hospital. Because of his severe injuries, he died at 4:30 PM despite medical treatment. The hospital notified the police station, which sent detectives to transport the body to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home to await inspection by the court.</p>

<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and his wife held a tea party at their private residence at No. 464 Haig Road from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM yesterday to see off Ambassador to Japan Jiang Zuobin and his wife and Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi and his wife. Central Committee member Zhang Qun, Takeover Committee Chairman Yin Rugeng, Jiangsu Second Higher Branch Court President Liang Renjie, Second Special District Court President Ying Shi, heads of various municipal government bureaus, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Jiaotong University President Wang Jingqi, gentlemen and merchants Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Yuan Lideng, and newspaper reporters attended, totaling over a hundred people. Mayor Wu and his wife, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, and Secretary Chen Kecheng warmly welcomed the guests, serving Western-style tea and refreshments, and the Public Security Bureau provided music. After the refreshments, the guests took a group photo. The party ended at around 7:00 PM with everyone in high spirits. At Mayor Wu's reception yesterday, Ambassador to Japan Jiang Zuobin told this newspaper's reporter that all his diplomatic policies towards Japan after his arrival would be based on the intentions of the Central Government. Rumors that he was taking a new plan to Japan to discuss with the Japanese government are completely unfounded. The Japanese government's true opinion on this matter is still unclear, so there is no way that we could propose a new plan. Therefore, the various external rumors are not credible. He also telegraphed the Central Political Committee a few days ago, saying that he was about to travel to Japan and that it was difficult to take care of the duties of Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and convener of the Foreign Affairs Group, and that they should select someone else to take his place. Ambassador Jiang is scheduled to depart on the Ping An Maru on the 6th. He will be accompanied by a secretary and two military attachés. The Central Government has not yet assigned them and will need a few more days to do so before they can leave.</p>

<p>The Japanese Army at the Huafeng Factory Will Withdraw Early Next Week Regarding the withdrawal date of the Japanese army from District D, after repeated negotiations with the Japanese side by the Joint Committee and Committee Members Fang, Yu Hongjun, and Wen Yinxing, no definite answer has been received. Therefore, Committee Member Yu sent a letter to the chairman of the Joint Committee, Cunningham, on the 28th of last month, asking him to urge the Japanese side to withdraw as soon as possible. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Secretary Langer of the Joint Committee and Committee Member Yu Hongjun yesterday, and their statements are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Langer's Opinion: This reporter visited Secretary Langer of the Joint Committee at the American Consulate yesterday morning and asked what the Joint Committee would do about the Japanese army's delayed withdrawal from District D. According to him, the Joint Committee hopes that the Chinese and Japanese sides can negotiate the Japanese army's withdrawal from District D themselves. I know that Chinese Committee Member Yu Hongjun and Japanese Committee Member Okazaki have been meeting and discussing frequently in recent days, and there has been much progress. Therefore, the Joint Committee does not need to convene another meeting to discuss it. As for Committee Member Yu's letter to Chairman Cunningham on the 28th of last month, relaying a letter from Japanese Committee Member Okazaki, it has been relayed to the Japanese side. I do not know whether the Japanese side has responded. In short, most of the matters regarding the withdrawal of the Japanese army from the Shanghai war have been resolved, and only one or two minor issues remain to be resolved.</p>
<p>Yu's Statement: Committee Member Yu Hongjun told the reporter that regarding the withdrawal of the Japanese army from District D and the Toyoda and other yarn factories, Japanese Committee Member Okazaki informed him by telephone this afternoon (yesterday afternoon) that the Japanese army at the Huafeng Yarn Factory is scheduled to withdraw early next week. The withdrawal of the Japanese army from the Toyoda and Kunda yarn factories and Yangshupu and other places is also in preparation. However, no clear date has been given for the withdrawal.</p>

<p>The previous afternoon, the Zhabei Office transported shells left over from the war to the ordnance depot of the arsenal for storage. Due to careless handling, an explosion occurred, resulting in casualties. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The situation yesterday is reported below:</p>
<p>Two Soldiers Died: Chen Zhengxiang, the ordnance depot soldier who was seriously injured in the explosion, died at 9:00 PM the previous night at the Red Cross Hospital due to his injuries. Gao Shangde also died at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The arsenal authorities, upon hearing the news, expressed deep regret as the two depot soldiers had been working at the arsenal for more than ten years and had always been very careful in their work. The general affairs department first borrowed 50 yuan for coffins and funeral expenses. The issue of compensation will be discussed with the municipal government before it is issued. Chen and Gao were survived by their wives, mothers, children who were all inconsolable after hearing the news.</p>
<p>Hong and Gu Buried: The body of Hong Shuren, adjutant of the Zhabei Office of the Public Security Bureau, who died on the spot, was originally placed in front of warehouse No. 13, the site of the incident. That night, the office sent personnel to transport the body for burial. Gu Shan, a coolie from the China Moving Company, was transported by the company at 10:00 AM yesterday. All the shells stored in the China Moving Company trucks that had not yet been moved were moved by the arsenal depot soldiers to the open space outside the warehouse that night and temporarily stored there. The truck then drove back to the company.</p>
<p>Reported to the Military: After the incident, Zhang Zulian, the head of the ordnance depot, reported the situation to Factory Director Song. After receiving the report, Factory Director Song telegraphed Vice Minister Chen of the Ministry of Military Affairs and Director Hong of the Ordnance Department.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance repeatedly regarding the special business tax imposed by Jiangsu Province, urging its abolition. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance telegraphed the chamber yesterday, stating, "To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, we have received your telegrams. The case of Jiangsu Province's proposed special business sales tax has been presented to the Executive Yuan, which ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Government to abolish it. This ministry has forwarded the order to the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department for compliance. Please be informed. Ministry of Finance Seal."</p>

<p>The bean and rice merchants had previously extended the deadline for clearing all debts with their customers to the end of June. If they were not cleared by then, they would be dealt with in accordance with the announced methods starting on July 1st. Because the merchants did not have enough time to complete the procedures, they convened a meeting of the north and south rice industry merchants at the Cuixiu Hall yesterday. It was resolved that the north and south merchants would investigate the shareholders and managers of the indebted customers and report them to the north and south offices for review. Starting on the 10th of this month, they will announce a temporary suspension of business dealings and the merchants will independently pursue legal remedies.</p>

<p>Zhu Shaoliang and Zhang Yin, deputy commanders-in-chief of the Taihu bandit suppression, telegraphed Chairman Chiang yesterday, requesting to resign from their respective positions. The telegram stated, "To Chairman Chiang, With Respects, We received your instructions of June 27th, appointing Zhu Shaoliang as the commander-in-chief of the Taihu bandit suppression and Zhang Yin as the deputy commander-in-chief. We believe that Taihu is a strategically important area of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and bandit suppression is a matter of utmost importance to the local area. Bandit suppression and pacification should be mutually supportive, and military affairs and administration are closely related. The area involves two provinces, and unified operation is essential. This relationship is extremely important, and the mechanisms are very subtle. A slight misstep can lead to many obstacles. After careful consideration, the positions of commander-in-chief and deputy commander-in-chief of the Taihu bandit suppression are not light responsibilities and are beyond the capabilities of Shaoliang and Yin. Furthermore, Shaoliang has been in the military for many years and has experienced many hardships. Yin has experienced many changes in the world and is increasingly aware of the dangers. Given the many difficulties of the times, we feel a deep sense of hidden concern. In accordance with the principle that everyone is responsible, we should strive to serve. Given the gentleman's heart of diligence, how dare we take on such a heavy burden? Rather than causing future mistakes and burdening your knowledge of people, we should honestly state our case and retreat in advance, knowing the difficulty. In our ignorance and clumsiness, we should avoid delaying important matters. We respectfully request that you consider our sincerity and allow us to withdraw our acceptance. We pray earnestly. Zhu Shaoliang and Chen Yin kowtow."</p>

<p>Discussing National Salvation Through People's Rule Xiong Bing'san, Zhu Ziqiao, and Li Yunshu held a public banquet for the 93-year-old Ma Xiangbo at the Xuhui Arts and Crafts Factory the other day. Huang Renzhi, Liu Dayi, Shi Liangcai, Li Zushen, Xu Jingxian, Lu Jingqing, Yin Ruli, Zhu Zhiyao, Gu Shouxi, Li Zunian, Zhang Sheng, and dozens of others were present. At the banquet, Ma Xiangbo delivered a prepared declaration for the establishment of the Chinese People's Rule Promotion Association, consisting of more than 2,000 words. He discussed the various strategies for governing the country, focusing on both the symptoms and the root causes, and clarifying the crux of the current situation and the key points. The main points were: (1) discussing history from an international perspective, (2) discussing national politics from a philosophical perspective, (3) discussing national politics from a practical perspective, (4) discussing politics from a current perspective, and (5) discussing people's rule from a practical perspective. All those present signed their approval, considering it a fundamental plan and a manifestation of the wisdom of an elder statesman who had a unique vision.

<h3 id="e143">The Jiangxi Business Community Continues to Request the Abolition of the Production and Sales Donation <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Jiangxi Business Association Continued to Telegraph Chairman Xiong of the Jiangxi Provincial Government: "To Chairman Xiong of Nanchang, With Respects, Disaster has befallen our Jiangxi, and heaven has abandoned our people. The floods are unprecedented, and the banditry is endless. No land is clean, and the people are in dire straits. Fortunately, the governor of the province is a respected elder from our hometown. We hoped that the dying merchants would have a chance to recover. Unexpectedly, the production and sales donation has been imposed at this time. The abuses of the likin system were just eliminated, and the imperial decree is still fresh. If this donation is said to be for suppressing bandits, the abolition of likin occurred during a year of banditry. The government officials resolutely did so, believing that the military expenses could be compensated by increasing taxes. All the bandit suppression troops in Jiangxi are dispatched by the Central Government. We have not heard of any order from the Central Government requiring Jiangxi to bear the military expenses. Why should our provincial governor bear to increase the burden on the people of Jiangxi? Although the donation comes from merchants, it is actually taken from the people. The more donations, the poorer the people. Can a place be stable if the people are not prosperous? Can banditry be eliminated if a place is unstable? Whether it conflicts with the Central Government's decree to abolish likin is not something that the merchants dare to comment on or speculate about. The merchants dare not resist the donation because they only hope for the people's well-being. We ask our wise governor and respected elder to be mindful of the plight of the helpless people of Jiangxi, leave them a lifeline, withdraw your order, and benefit our hometown. This is the merchants' good fortune, the people's good fortune, and the good fortune of all of Jiangxi. The Shanghai Jiangxi Business Association kowtows."</p>

<h3 id="e147">Declaration of the Shanghai General Tenants' Association <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Tenants' Association declares that since the violent sun invaded Shanghai, launching attacks at midnight with airplanes, cannons, and flames filling the sky and smoke obscuring the sun, the people of the entire city fled empty-handed. Taking Zhabei as an example, the prosperous market city has been reduced to ruins, and the flourishing business areas have turned into rubble. Men and women have suffered such trampling. Such a disaster is rarely seen in history, and the extent of the loss can be known without further explanation. The association was founded in March of the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927). Residents of the city, believing that the revolutionary army had reached Shanghai and would publicize the reduction of the people's burden and implement the 25% rent reduction policy, organized this association one after another. However, in the initial stages, the regulations were not yet established. Fortunately, the municipal party headquarters convened a meeting and merged on the third floor to form the Shanghai Special Municipality General Tenants' Association, proceeding unanimously. In June of the same year, the government issued a notice prohibiting unwarranted rent increases, forced evictions, and the collection of digging rent tips, etc., all of which were on file. For several years, there have been very few disputes between tenants and landlords. Therefore, the association's affairs [blank space], but this time, with the Shanghai incident, the original branch associations have requested rescue and relief one after another. It concerns the tenants' demands to alleviate their personal suffering, and the association cannot remain silent. Therefore, a representative conference was convened yesterday to re-elect officers and take charge, sending letters to party and government agencies to send personnel to guide the discussion of methods for separately reducing and exempting rents this time, so as to implement them in reality. The rent in this city is the highest in the country. The level of rent should be based on the prosperity of the market. In the current state of economic depression, with the market factually closed to resist the enemy for nearly two months, all industries have stagnated, life is extremely difficult, and the burden is high. Rent has become a major social issue. Although residents in the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession are nominally safe, people without property have fled for their lives, abandoning their possessions and escaping alone, but without business or production, bearing high rents, it is impossible not to demand reduction or exemption. After the Sino-Japanese War and the Japanese earthquake, there were precedents for rent reduction and exemption. Now, the Jing-Hang-Beng-Zhen areas affected by the Shanghai war have already implemented rent reduction and exemption. How can the Shanghai war zone, so close at hand, have the entire city's tenants making such uniform moans and tragic appeals, and making requests that follow the rules and regulations, hoping to equally share the losses suffered in the war? After several months, no effect has been achieved, and no effective measures have been announced by the authorities. Although various groups have drafted measures, in addition to a small number of enlightened landlords who have automatically exempted rent, there are indeed many, but most landlords who only care about profit are controlling the courts, forcing evictions and demanding debts, and wielding power. Therefore, letters from tenants in various neighborhoods requesting assistance are pouring in like snowflakes. The courts, before receiving specific instructions, have no basis for how to reduce or exempt rents. The people of the entire city are suffering mental pain, calling out without response and appealing without [blank space]. The environment is forced to be like this, but there is no way to remedy it except to earnestly request the wise authorities to quickly stipulate effective measures for rent reduction and exemption. If it can be stipulated early, for the landlord, it will only reduce the current number of income, while for the tenant, it can relieve unlimited pain. What is most feared is that millions of people who are stretching their necks and looking up will continue to brew like this, wandering into divergent paths, which is contrary to social stability and market prosperity. We hope that the general landlords who do not understand will consider the feelings between the landlord and the tenant, clearly express their views, and no longer act coyly, procrastinate, and increase the mental pain of the tenants in the city. All tenants in the city will have a sense of gratitude for the favor. This is the declaration, and we hope for public discernment.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce believes that the areas of Wusong and Jiangwan, after this war, are likely to experience epidemics. If prevention is not timely, and the epidemic becomes rampant and spreads throughout the city, it will be of great concern to the lives of citizens. Yesterday, the 100th executive committee meeting decided to allocate funds of 1,000 yuan based on the letter from the Wusong branch office and entrust the Chinese Red Cross to set up a temporary epidemic hospital in Wusong Jiang[blank character] and other places to provide medical treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Begins Issuing Certificates of Origin <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce previously approved a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, approving a letter from the Polish treaty representative in China, stating that the proof of origin for goods exported from China to Poland has always been provided by Chinese merchants. Now, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of Poland intends to list the agencies in important Chinese commercial ports that issue certificates of origin, hoping for a reply after review and approval. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce also approved a letter from the French legation in China, stating that in order to implement the order issued on October 3, 1930, by the French government, all products such as live and dead poultry, grains and their accessories, sugar, raw sugar syrup, ordinary wood, gelatinous substances, essential oils and fats, essential oil acids, and fat acids must be accompanied by a certificate of origin before they can be imported into France. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that the certificate of origin is used to identify the goods exported from the country and to prevent foreign merchants from counterfeiting. All countries have precedents. Therefore, it negotiated with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to formulate eight rules for the issuance of certificates of origin, which were submitted to the State Council of the Executive Yuan for resolution and approval. Rule 2 stipulates that the Commodity Inspection Bureau or Inspection Sub-Bureau in various places under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is the competent agency for issuing certificates. The certificate fee is two yuan in national currency per sheet. After these rules were distributed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for implementation, in addition to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce informing the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it also ordered the Commodity Inspection Bureau in various places to follow these rules. After receiving the order, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau started issuing the certificates yesterday (the 1st), and has sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Jianghai Customs, requesting them to check and inform all exporters to announce them to the public, and ordered the Ningbo branch of the bureau to follow these rules.</p>

<p>The Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Branch received a telegram from the sub-bureau on June 30, stating that it had recently received a telegram from the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau: "The Jiangsu Provincial Government ordered all counties to take over the tobacco and alcohol license tax. The Finance Ministry's Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Department previously sent a telegram stating that this license tax has always been collected directly by the central government, and all provinces follow this practice. It is difficult to divide it. An electric request has been sent to the Executive Yuan to order a stop. Please instruct the license tax sub-bureaus under your jurisdiction to follow the old practice and earnestly collect taxes." "It should be announced to the public to dispel doubts. In addition to the telegram, a notice is issued. Please post it widely to inform the public and report the date of receipt." Therefore, in addition to the telegram, 20 copies of the original notice are issued to the branch. Please post them widely to inform the public and report the date of receipt. Branch Director Gu Yan stamped.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Banquet Record of the Aviation Construction Association <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the China Aviation Construction Association hosted a banquet for various circles at the YMCA. More than 50 people attended the banquet, including Weng Zhaoyuan, Zhu Ziqiao, Xu Shiying, Xiong Xiling, Chu Huiseng, Hu Yunqiu, Yan Zhifang, Hu Pu'an, Hu Shuhua, Wen Zongyao, Yin Zhiling, Li Cishan, and Huang Menggui. Halfway through the banquet, Zhu Ziqiao stood up to give a speech, followed by speeches by Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan, Xiong Bing San, Xu Shiying, Li Cishan, and Hu Yunqiu. Brigade Commander Weng said that the purpose of aviation development is known to everyone and is a matter of urgency. However, in my humble opinion, this matter cannot be accomplished by the efforts of a few people. We should concentrate the strength of the people of the whole country and popularize the business as a civil purpose. However, when our countrymen do things, they often have a fear of those who follow after one failure. Now we should first break this bad idea, hold on, determined to go to the bottom. At the same time, we should work hard in the publicity aspect, from Shanghai to the whole province, from the whole province to the whole country, so that the people of the whole country know that seeking aviation is really an important matter now. Looking at the great powers in the aviation industry, such as setting up</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>up aviation schools, training specialized talents, building factories, manufacturing, airfields, etc., the people first enjoy the benefits of convenient transportation and rapid transportation. If private financial resources are not enough, the government will find ways to remedy it, and make it happen. Now, if China can gather the manufacturing and research power of ironworks across the country to study various objects on airplanes, then in Shanghai alone, it is said that there are more than 800 copper and ironworks. If each factory can research one item, such as screws, copper bars, and copper sheets, then once something happens, it will not be difficult to gather all the strength and make up a piece to serve the country. As for the basic conditions, it is especially appropriate to start with children's education, so that everyone knows that they have an interest in aviation. Later, Xiong Xiling, Xu Jingren, and others gave speeches. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM, and the first board meeting was held. More than 20 people attended, including Weng Zhaoyuan and Zhu Ziqiao. Chairman Xiong Bingsan first passed the articles of association one by one, and elected executive directors Zhu Ziqiao, Xu Shiying, Yin Zhiling, Tan Bozhi, Luo Yinpu, Lin Kanghou, Hu Yunqiu, Huang Menggui, Zheng Xitao, and nine others. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>The detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, together with the Third Precinct of the Fifth District, uncovered a large gambling den organized by the traitor Hu Liufu and others in Huaxing Lane, Hu Jia Mu Bridge, Hongkou. When the detective team went to arrest them in disguise the night before, because the front door was a road built across the border, they entered the door and closed the front door tightly, and opened the back door. Police officers from the Third Precinct of the Fifth District arrested everyone present, including Xu Asi, Chen Amao, Zhang Ziwen, Han Quansheng, Qian Xueqin, and Lu Mao da, etc., a total of 111 people, who were tied up like hairy crabs and sent to the police station. They were immediately presented to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday morning, the judicial department prepared a document and transferred them to the local court for interrogation. The prosecutor conducted a separate preliminary hearing, and all were detained and prosecuted.</p>
<h3 id="e154">County Finance Bureau Announces Deadline for Paying Deed Tax <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Approved by the Provincial Department of Finance, a one-month grace period is granted without penalty. The Shanghai County Finance Bureau announces that residents who sell and buy farmland and real estate should pay the deed tax within three months of the contract. Those who fail to pay within the time limit will be penalized according to regulations. This year, due to the war in Shanghai, residents were busy moving and avoiding the situation, and there were many white deeds that exceeded the time limit without being taxed. Now that the situation has stabilized, they should go to the bureau to pay. Considering the special circumstances this time, many households did not pay the deed tax because they were too hasty and had no time to take care of it, which is excusable. It has been submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance for special consideration, and all unpaid contracts in the county will be granted a grace period without penalty for one month, regardless of the date of the contract, to show sympathy. The order of the Provincial Department of Finance has been approved. In addition to sending personnel to conduct strict inspections, the bureau has announced to the county's households yesterday that they must bring the deeds to the bureau to pay the tax within one month from the date of the announcement, and they will be exempted from penalties.</p>

<p>Unemployed workers request relief from party and government agencies. The China Industrial Factory on Bailu Linan Road, West Shanghai, has suffered significant losses due to the war. The board of directors of the factory plans to lay off the silk and satin department and the receiving and dispatching department from the 10th of this month, and all 350 workers in the two departments will be unemployed again.

<h3 id="e157">Young Woman Accuses Fan Zhaolan of Seduction, Abandonment, and Injury <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Fan Zhaolan, a Shaoxing native residing at No. 179 Xiang'an Lane, Keneng Road, works at the Ministry of Railways. Recently, Fan Wu, a 22-year-old woman from Songjiang, hired lawyer Wu Chengyu to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing him of seduction, abandonment, and injury. The lawsuit stated that the plaintiff came to Shanghai two years ago to make a living and worked as a cotton thread worker. The defendant began to seduce her. At that time, the plaintiff was only 19 years old and lacked knowledge, so she was seduced and rented a house. After living for about two months, the defendant rented a house at No. 52 Li'an Lane at the railway station. On August 21st of last year (lunar calendar), she gave birth to a son, and the defendant named him Fan Tao. He invited relatives and friends to the Hangzhou Hotel to celebrate the baby's one-month anniversary. On the first day of October, they moved to Keneng Road. However, when they moved in, the defendant had a mistress named Zhang living with him. The plaintiff was very unhappy and questioned him. At that time, the plaintiff's sister, Shen Wu, came to Shanghai and urged the defendant to hold a wedding. The defendant said that the child had already been born and there was no need to do so. The plaintiff had already made it so there was nothing she could do. From then on, their relationship broke down. On December 6th of last year, her son Fan Tao fell ill and died in a few days. She suspected Zhang. The plaintiff was deeply grieved for her son, so she often had disputes with Zhang. On June 17th, the defendant helped Zhang to beat the plaintiff. On May 2nd (lunar calendar), he forced the plaintiff to sign a letter of separation, saying that he would give her 200 yuan. The plaintiff refused, but on the 12th, the defendant beat the plaintiff and drove her out. She immediately reported to a lawyer and reported to the Huishi police station and sent it to Tongren Hospital for examination and injury, and instructed to file a lawsuit in court. In such a situation, the defendant seduced a woman under the age of 20, mistakenly believed that there was a marital relationship, and was happy to continue to commit adultery and have children. Fan Tao lived with Zhang and died within a few days, which is suspected of murder. After the defendant’s death, he said that he was beaten to death. He has already violated Article 257 of the Criminal Law of Seduction, Article 244 of Marriage Fraud, Article 310 of Abandonment, and Article 282 of the Criminal Law with Zhang on Murder Crime 293, injury, please punish according to law, in regard to the additional civil proceedings, should be compensated for 40 yuan per month, up to 60 years old, a living expense of 19,200 yuan, and because the plaintiff gave birth to a child and was abandoned, abused, and beaten, she suffered great mental pain and should be given a one-time consolation payment of 4,000 yuan, because the defendant works in the Ministry of Railways and does not have this ability." The court approved the lawsuit and ordered him to summon him. In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the judge Feng Shide heard the case in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff and the lawyer Wu attended the court. Fan Wu stated the above situation. The defendant was interrogated, but he did not arrive. The attorney submitted a letter to the court, saying that the defendant was not in Shanghai and requested a postponement. Feng Yu approved the case and ordered another hearing to be scheduled.</p>

<p>People in the shed claimed that a child was taken out of the car. At about 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, someone from the detective team of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei reported that a car was found in the wasteland west of Zhao Jia Bei Yuan, Hu Tai Road, without a license plate. The leader Wang Shifu immediately reported to District Chief Wu and sent investigator Li Guiqing and Xie Qihua to the Pengpu Security Corps, together with platoon leader Shi Yingfu of the First Defense Unit of the Second Team. They saw the above-mentioned vehicle. The car was driven to the place at around 8:00 PM more than ten days ago, and a child was taken out of the car. It was in the evening, so the gender was unknown. The investigators immediately reported back to the district chief, who ordered the driver to drive the vehicle back and park it at the Shanghai North Office of the Gonghe Road Public Security Bureau, while investigating the truth of the case.</p>

<p>Please respond to the compensation. The Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Association members believe that the insurance companies have not yet made a definite statement on the compensation issue. The association convened its eighth executive committee meeting at the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce on Edward Road at 12:00 noon yesterday, with Tang Youwei and Fang Jiaobo attending to discuss countermeasures and resolved to write to Chinese and foreign insurance companies immediately for reply. The original letter is transcribed below: Sincerely, it is noted that your company insures our members for fire insurance compensation. The association has already prepared a list of requests on May 30th and sent it to you. I hope to see it and observe it. It has been many days and have not been notified of the compensation, and there has been no reply, which is causing concern. After the disaster, all members of our association have no way to make a living and cannot die, and urgently await compensation from your company to provide relief. I am writing to request that you investigate and deal with the previous letter, and ask the gentleman to reply to comfort the disaster victims and avoid all kinds of accidents.

<p>Only Tong Tianhua is suspected of murder. Hua Detective Shi Sijian, Detective Wang Runhe, Bao Shuji, etc. of the Hongkou Patrol Station, previously detained 15 people, including Wang Agen, Tong Tianhua, and Shi Jincai, suspected of being thieves, at the Hongyun Inn, No. 1009 Haining Road. A large bundle of gambling club receipts was seized and sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong came to the Fourth Criminal Court for questioning. The patrol station lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that after investigation, the defendants had not committed any theft cases and were all fond of gambling clubs. However, the second defendant, Tong Tianhua from Ningbo, was suspected of being at the scene when Wang Wenxiang from Shaoxing, accompanied by his wife Lan, was shot and assassinated by his enemy on Pi Shaonai Road in the French Concession at around 2 a.m. on May 19 this year, according to the patrol station's investigation. Therefore, the patrol station sent detectives to arrest him and did not object to the transfer for trial. He requested the court to make a ruling. The other defendants were simple court cases. He also stated that in a case last year at the Huishi Patrol Station, Tong was the plaintiff and someone wanted to assassinate him as well, instigated by Ma Pi Agen, a flower club king living in the French Concession. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Zhang Ziying of the French Patrol Station reported the matter. When questioned, Tong Tianhua hired a lawyer to request sufficient evidence. Detective Zhang stated that Wang's wife, Lan, was still in her hometown and had not yet come to Shanghai. Judge Shen ruled that since this court and the Second Court were the same judicial organ, Tong Tianhua and the other defendants should be transferred from the Simple Court for trial and handed over to the French Patrol Station to take them back for investigation.</p>

<p>To the Editor, Upon reviewing your newspaper dated the 27th of this month, I found a news item about the labor unrest in the pharmaceutical industry, which stated that "Jiang Hao, a special commissioner sent by the Central People's Movement Committee stationed in Shanghai, is investigating the truth in order to verify and handle the matter." Also, in the news item about the labor unrest in the silk factory on the 29th of this month, it was stated that "Jiang Hao, a special commissioner of the Central People's Movement Steering Committee, received instructions from the Central Committee to investigate the truth, report to the Central Committee, and await transfer orders for mediation." I have come to Shanghai to investigate the current state of labor movements in this city, and I am not a special commissioner specially sent by the Central Committee to handle these labor unrests. The Central Committee has not sent any telegrams instructing me to investigate the labor unrest in the silk factory. The above-mentioned sections in the newspapers are inconsistent with the facts. I hereby send this special letter to you, hoping that you will publish the original letter and make corrections. Sincerely, Jiang Hao, July 1st.</p>

<p>When Puyi's concubine Wenxiu divorced him, Puyi agreed to provide 400 yuan per month for alimony. Now Puyi has broken the contract and has not paid a single cent. Puyi is clearly trying to shed his feathers. Wenxiu is very anxious and urgently telegraphed Puyi, asking him to remember their past affection and provide alimony. Puyi has not only broken the contract in this matter, but is also ungrateful and forgets his affection, which is too heartless.</p>
<p>However, during the Xinhai Revolution, the Chinese government also agreed to provide preferential expenses for the imperial family, amounting to 3 million yuan per year. Later, due to the government's financial difficulties, it gradually shed its feathers, which greatly affected Puyi's life. In the past, the Chinese government shed Puyi's feathers, and now Puyi is also shedding Wenxiu's feathers. Big shedding and small shedding, Puyi is really well-behaved and learns it right away.</p>
<p>According to Puyi's response, "The master wants to grant you death, and you still dare to ask for alimony!" Why didn't Puyi dare to say such a thing when he was in Tianjin? Now that he is covered by the name of foreigners, he says such sparkling nonsense, with the idea that "If the ruler wants his minister to die, the minister must die." But don't be too proud. In the past, the Chinese government shed your feathers. Who knows if the Japanese will not shed your feathers in the future?</p>
<p>Some surviving nobles and dignitaries are afraid that Wenxiu will drift around Tianjin and expose Puyi's scandal. They plan to jointly raise the current alimony. I don't think it is necessary. How can you poor and stingy surviving nobles and dignitaries afford this amount of money every month? In the end, you will inevitably have to stop shedding feathers. It is better to let Wenxiu drift around Tianjin, flaunt her beauty, and use Puyi's great name to attract lustful followers. Are you afraid that you won't get 400 yuan a month?</p>
<p>Puyi's flattery to the Japanese and Wenxiu's sacrifice for her love are originally mutually reinforcing things. What face is there to talk about?</p>

<p>The old tree and lonely flower are obsessed with their own meaning, quietly participating in Wanling's samadhi. How many schools of the West River are left now? Except for Chi'an, there are several Xiaochuan (Hua Lanshi Xia Jiancheng).</p>
<p>The Cangqiu's poetic brush walks like a dragon and snake, and Jianxue's romantic style is his own family. For ten years, he ate English Chu ministers' tears, unable to chant against Yixi flowers (Chen Renxian).</p>
<p>The poetic taste of the poetry hut is different from sour and salty, inheriting the mantle from Boyan. In the future, Jinghua will add anecdotes, and a niche will be occupied by Fashi Fan (Hu Shilu).</p>
<p>Ascending to Hengyue in the south and living in Juyong in the north, my two feet have traveled all over the peaks in my life. Tonight's moon on the Tianfang Tower, someone is clapping their hands and talking about Yuan Long (Jin Songcen Songcen's poems mostly record mountains and rivers, and he also likes to talk about the learning of managing the world).</p>
<p>The feathers are so high that they produce strange eagles, and the Dongling talent's spirit soars. The old friend is still there in Tang Qu, and the old tears are sprinkled into ice for no reason (Shao Xinjiong Xinjiong and my teacher Tang Weizhi Shangshu were close friends and died at the age of thirty-two. The teacher wrote a biography for him with particularly deep sorrow).</p>
<p>Guiling Lijiang's lonely heart, the sky can accommodate thousands of mountains to invade. Sometimes the red boudoir words of children, the oriole bird is also good to hear (Chen Shizhu respects the rhyme seven words, the old sentence of the teacher). This old man is indifferent and otherworldly, knowing the suffering and chanting for thousands of years with a lamp. Self-titled set of amazing words, five hundred years without poetry that catches the eye (from my uncle Shen Shiyou, the last seven characters are the sentence of the teacher).</p>

Since ancient times, talented people have been envied by things, and the brocade bags have fallen apart to whom to pay (Huang Moses Moses's poems are amazingly talented and brilliant, like Wang Zhongqu.

<p>(3) Manufacturing procedures After the equipment and raw materials for manufacturing bleaching powder are prepared, manufacturing can begin. First, spread a layer of lime more than an inch thick on each layer of the box. Then insert the glass tube that conducts chlorine gas into the hole at the bottom of the box. It must be inserted very firmly so that no gas leaks! Then light the alcohol lamp and heat it under the flask, and chlorine gas will flow from the glass tube into the box, and be completely absorbed by the layers of lime in the box from bottom to top. After five or six hours, you must observe it through the glass window outside the box. If there is no color in the box, remove the glass bottle that produces chlorine gas, and stir the lime in each layer of the box with a stick. After stirring, pass in chlorine gas according to the previous method. After another five or six hours, observe through the window outside the box again. If you still don't see the color, stir the lime in the box again according to the previous method, and pass in chlorine gas again. If you see a yellow gas in the lower part of the box, this proves that the lime in the lower part of the box has absorbed enough chlorine gas. At this time, you must move the glass tube to the upper hole, close the lower hole tightly, and then pass in chlorine gas so that the lime in the upper part absorbs chlorine gas. Only when there is yellow gas in the entire box can the glass bottle for producing chlorine gas be removed and the chlorine gas stopped from entering the box. After this is done, the lime in the box becomes bleaching powder. This is a small-scale production method. As for large-scale production, many iron boxes are connected together. There is a horizontal axis in each iron box, and there are many teeth around the axis. When chlorine gas is passed in, the axis rotates slowly, which can stir the lime and make it evenly absorb chlorine gas.</p>
<p>(4) How to use bleaching powder Put the bleaching powder in a tank, first pour in dilute sulfuric acid, then add clean water to make a thin solution; then take colored cloth or paper and other items, immerse them in this solution, and then take them out and wash them lightly with clean water. Wash and then immerse it in the tank. After a few immersions and washes like this, the colored cloth will gradually become very white.</p>
<p>(5) How to preserve bleaching powder If bleaching powder is exposed to the air, it will combine with water vapor or carbon gas, which will gradually decompose and lose its bleaching effect. Therefore, it must be stored in a bottle or wooden box to avoid contact with the outside air. When using a wooden box, the inside of the box must be lined with thin lead skin; the seams on the outside must be soldered with tin, otherwise it will still be ineffective.</p>
<p>(6) Why can bleaching powder bleach? The reason why bleaching powder has a bleaching effect is because when bleaching powder is placed in a tank, it encounters sulfuric acid and releases chlorine gas to夺夺chlorine gas in the pigment, causing the original components to decompose and thus become white. Therefore, the effect of bleaching powder lies in pure chlorine gas.</p>

<p>— 無畏</p>
<p>The class bell has rung, Mr. Xu, who teaches trigonometry, walks into the classroom with his briefcase. At this time, only one-third of the people are in the classroom, but experience tells him that there are always so few students in the ten minutes after the class bell rings, so he doesn't care and does his routine work - roll call - when the roll call is about to be finished, the students enter one after another, some with their mouths moving as they chew something, some with their trigonometry books, but at least a novel or newspaper is sandwiched in the book.</p>
<p>"Mr. Xu, No. X has arrived," they say automatically when they enter the classroom. Mr. Xu is probably old and has good self-cultivation, so he is not angry at all. He just says yes in his mouth, while his eyes and hands keep looking for the number to mark them present, but Mr. Xu's myopia is very serious, so it is easy for twenty minutes to pass like this.</p>
<p>Probably the common psychology is always to bully the good, they know that Mr. Xu is easy to bully, and his myopia is not shallow, those who are not good at moving read newspapers and novels, those who are good at moving talk about the Classic of Mountains and Seas, and sometimes they have to use their hands and feet to perform a full martial arts show. Mr. Xu always says with a smile: "Don't talk, you are not young anymore, you will graduate at the beginning of the year, listen carefully." These words are in vain, the classroom is still full of talking, unless the principal comes, it will be quiet for a moment.</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Xu is facing the blackboard: doing a question, the active L, holding a slingshot: wants to use soybeans to hit S sitting in the first row, somehow, it hits the back of Mr. Xu's head, he quickly turns around to see who it is, but his eyesight is not good, so he is disappointed.</p>
<p>"Pigs! Really shameless, are you people? What::" Mr. Xu is angry, his feet</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Hitting the podium, his face turned red, L is very good, he quickly buried his head pretending to be reading.</p>
<p>At this time, the few who were talking: were confused by this, and stopped talking, so the air in the classroom suddenly became quiet. Mr. Xu scolded alone like this, feeling that he had no way to end, so his face immediately became peaceful again, he said:</p>
<p>"Don't mess around in the future, if you make me angry, I will scold people, if I get used to scolding in the future, everyone will be bored. We also talked, interrupted, and made the teacher happy when we were students, but not as good as you:: Okay, look carefully at the book, don't say in the future that Mr. Xu taught badly: making us not understand, in fact! It is you who don't listen, but the teaching is indeed what I taught, and you can't deny it, so everyone hurry up and listen carefully: don't make me old man embarrassed?" Everyone laughed loudly, and suddenly broke the quiet air.</p>

<p>— 嚴夢</p>
<p>I accidentally went back to Dade Lane on North Sichuan Road, which had once been a battlefield, with a friend who was moving things. The peach-colored girls on the street, dressed as flamboyant southern girls - my fellow fairies - are unfolding the smiles of youth in the car box or next to the road, just like scarlet spring flowers, rouge cheeks and lipstick, how moving is the temptation? The establishment of liquor stalls, the series of gold-selling caves, a coffee shop every five steps, and a dance hall every ten steps, oh, prosperous age, is it not in this that the reason why North Sichuan Road has become a mysterious road lies?</p>
<p>That bustling city area has now changed. When our tired feet stepped on that tired street, what we saw was nothing but a desolate rubble, the remains of the fire, the dilapidated walls, no longer the scene of the year. The blue-gray marines, the invincible yellow-clothed infantry, swaggered in the middle of the road, grinning and wielding messy steps. These murderous demons have been arbitrarily devastated in Shanghai, and now they are stepping into the Northeast. Their knives should be a new display - the blood of our nation!</p>
<p>We walked to Dade Lane with a sense of resentment. First, I went back to my home to visit, but besides the bullet marks and scars, it was as desolate as a gloomy ghost mansion. I mourned the canvas bed and writing desk and other things that resembled me for a long time, and nothing could evoke a deeper memorial - except for a lot of hard work that was scattered into manuscripts.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a while, I ran out from the back door, and as soon as I came out, I met a neighbor's wife who had been away for a long time. She asked me warmly about my life and the peace of the past - at the end, she earnestly asked, "Probably Shanghai will not fight again, right?"</p>
<p>"If I had known this today, why did I have to start a war in the first place?" She was concerned and felt pain, and I couldn't help but feel emotional when I heard it. She shook her head, sighed, and continued to ask me: "So what is Shanghai like? We women don't understand, do you know?" My heart was very sad at that time, and I didn't want to say anything more. So we parted ways. On the way back, I kept thinking: "What is Shanghai like?"</p>

<p>— Tang Zenggeng</p>
<p>On a gloomy rainy day, an incident occurred on M Road, instantly turning the usually quiet M Road into a hubbub of voices.  Breaking the silence of the past, nearly every window had one or two or three heads sticking out, watching? The unfolding of this farce.</p>
<p>"Haha, look everyone, the jealousy jar has been broken!"  In the quiet air, this cry rang out, followed by disorderly applause and women's scolding, creating a chaotic scene. This was the opening of the farce.</p>
<p>M Road was instantly dotted with many old, young, male, and female onlookers, especially in front of the door of a garage, where more people stood, surrounding it. Heads bobbed, and it was truly impossible to squeeze through.  This was the origin of this farce.  The area in front of the garage was the special reserved box, haha!</p>
<p>The main characters of the farce were two women with disheveled hair. They started by glaring at each other and finally resorted to a full-blown physical fight.</p>
<p>"You shameless harlot, who told you not to be a decent wife and come out selling yourself? Today you've met your match, I'll let you know how powerful I am, you shameless harlot!" The woman on the left cursed viciously, while rolling up her sleeves with both hands, preparing for a fierce fight.</p>
<p>"Don't even start, I don't know who's shameless. Why didn't you want a country bumpkin and had to come to Shanghai to steal my man, you slut, shameless!" The woman on the right said just as fiercely, also rolling up her sleeves.</p>
<p>"Pah, you cheap whore!"</p>
<p>"Pah, you rotten slut!"</p>
<p>They had already entered close combat. In a flash, the full-blown fight was about to begin. An uncontainable jealousy was burning in both of their hearts.</p>
<p>In a moment, the full-blown fight began. The large circle of people in front of the garage had now expanded, and in the center of the circle, the two main characters were tearing at each other, grappling into a ball, each hurling insults, drawing applause and laughter from the audience.</p>
<p>"Rip—!" The sound of clothes tearing.</p>
<p>"Snap—!" The sound of pants splitting.</p>
<p>"Haha!" Another burst of uproarious laughter. Hundreds of eyes were now directly focused on their breasts and vaginas, but on the muddy ground, they were still fighting desperately. Their disheveled clothes were covered in mud, and curses continued to pour from their mouths.</p>
<p>"Hey, officer, why aren't you doing anything?" A white-haired old man said to the policeman who was standing watching.</p>
<p>"Oh, sir, people say an honest official doesn't interfere in family matters. We don't take care of this kind of thing, haha!" The officer said, continuing to stare and laugh.</p>
<p>"Alas, people's hearts aren't like they used to be, morality is declining. We donate money so you can eat and watch fights? This is outrageous, alas, the dynasty is doomed!" The old man said sarcastically, slowly walking away from the officer.</p>
<p>"Hmph!" This was the officer's parting gesture.</p>
<p>At this time, the full-blown fight was still going on, but it wasn't as intense as it had been at the beginning.</p>
<p>After a short while, perhaps because the two generals were exhausted, they began to realize how exposed and ugly they had become. Therefore, they ceased hostilities amidst the cheering and laughter, still punctuated by their curses. A farcical play of a full-blown fight ended invisibly.</p>
<p>However, on M Road, the discussions were diverse, chaotic, and noisy, no longer resembling the tranquility of the past.</p>

<p>Having read Mr. Yun Li's article on candle manufacturing methods in your esteemed publication on May 25th, I am eager to experiment with it, but I have several questions for the author to answer: (1) Are the two ingredients, paraffin wax and stearin, domestic products, and are they common white waxes? (2) Where can the above two raw materials be purchased at the most affordable price? (3) After melting the raw materials in a pot, does the final quantity of the finished product decrease compared to the raw materials? I earnestly request that Mr. Yun Li provide detailed answers to the above questions or provide his address for easy contact. Seeking answers is deeply appreciated.</p>

The creditor should be paid and the case should be closed. ▲ Zhang Tingqing's application to be exempt from detention and pay in installments is noted, as well as the submitted case funds of 200 yuan. As the petitioner still owes 512 yuan and 3 jiao and 6 fen, they should be paid in full immediately in order to close the case. The request to pay in installments cannot be approved. ▲ Hua Jiaben's application for execution is noted. It is confirmed that the debtor, Wang Huidi, paid 100 yuan in case funds on May 17. You should come to the court at 8:00 AM on July 4 to collect it. As for the remaining amount owed, you should wait for a date to be set for summoning and executing. ▲ Zhang Baogen's application to collect funds is noted. It is confirmed that the debtor paid 132 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen. You should come to the court at 8:00 AM on July 4 to collect it.</p>
