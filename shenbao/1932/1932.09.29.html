<p>時評</p>
<h3>日蘇關係之一張一弛</h3>
<p>又玄</p>
<p>日本乘世界經濟恐慌深化。列國自顧不暇。中國亦紛擾不寗之際。奪取東北三省。但旣以兵力占領之後。即引起兩個極嚴重問題。（一）日美衝突愈趨尖銳。因此促進中美兩國之確實聯合。（二）日蘇之間。以前有中國在。似乎尙可作緩衝現在則非直接衝突不可。有此二者。則日本雖强據满洲。其所得亦眞無異乎『呑下一顆炸彈。』</p>
<p>日美兩國雖係鄰國。但有太平洋相隔。最近處亦有四千海浬。宜乎利害衝突應不至十分厲害。而歐洲大戰以後。彼二國者皆爲戰爭之暴發户。世界恐慌襲來。又皆同感市塲極度窄狹之痛苦。開關新市塲。亦同以中華民國爲其惟一之對象。因此爭取市塲上之支配的領導地位。遂形成兩國不可解之寃家對頭。日本自身在恐慌極盛期中。（自一九三一年夏季至今年春初）其經濟的矛盾。日見擴大。竟有不可終日之勢。而開拓新市塲之外。尤須給其國民以新的剌戟。乃能轉移一般目光。忘去自己痛苦以對付其所謂「國難。」是以故意製造萬寳山案中村案。以激怒其國民。然後出兵東北。實行其軍國主義的侵略。旣得满洲之後。且將西侵平津山東。以作满洲第二。於是美國在華市塲。漸見縮小。對日將由經濟的衝突而引起政治的衝突。甚至因爭中國市塲而引起太平洋大戰爭。亦未可知。就目前情勢觀之。日美雙方。雖皆力避戰禍。但彼此又皆着着準備。又係不可掩之事實。</p>
<p>日俄原有舊仇。雖俄國經一度大革命之後。一時再無東侵能力。日本似可放心。然而一九二五年之後。蘇俄國基日益鞏固。尤以一九二八年「五年計劃」實施以來。不僅一般工業以統制的經濟組織。超越乎世界經濟恐慌範圍以外。其重工業建設與夫軍事工業之充實。軍備之增設。遠高出帝俄時代以上。日本帝國主義對之更懷戒懼。而資本主義與社會主義之根本衝突。亦因蘇俄之建設而愈甚。日本軍閥深知中國民族又已醒覺。民族資本之發達。亦將脫離帝國主義覊絆而圖自立。其中尤以紡織工業爲最明顯乃日本亦屬後進工業國家。其對華貿易。亦以棉製品爲大宗。因此乃竭其全力以壓制中國革命運動之勃興。同時更阻撓中國民族資本之向上發展在長江流域尙以國際關係複雜之故。而略有顧忌。在東北三省。則不惜露骨爲之竟以兵力作前鋒實行刼奪政策。然而满洲原爲中蘇日三國鼎足對立日蘇衝突亦　中國介在其間。減少多少困難。自日本襲佔瀋陽。北據哈爾濱黑龍江之後中國作用全失。日蘇之間。遂成直接的針鋒相對。雖有所謂「和製」满洲國存乎其間。而所謂满洲國之爲日本附庸。蘇俄豈不知之。不過中蘇之間。旣無國交。彼遂落得借中立之名。以與日本往還。且日蘇漁業新協定成立之後。戰爭危機。似已過去。一部樂觀者遂以爲是和平證據。其實正相反對。蓋蘇聯與日本。根本對立。萬難調和。不過蘇聯自第一次五年計劃完成以來。正邁步直向單獨建設社會主義國家猛進。故對於帝國主義國家與帝國主義國家之間的任何戰爭。均不願參加。蓋參加此種戰爭。旣無理由。尤無利得。故自去年九一八事變發生以來。即愼守緘默。雖日蘇兩國始終對立。在東北三省。時而暴風驟雨。時而烟霧瀰漫。時而爲人工製烟幕所籠罩。究竟不過一時現象。未嘗演成事實。戰爭雖一時不至實現。而中東鐵路受日本威脅。减去赤塔與海參威間的軍事效用。即經濟的價値。亦因吉會路洮昂路之關係而减少。故無論蘇俄如何隱忍。如何愼重。皆感極度之不快。且對於帝國主義國家之無限制侵略。决不能採取無抵抗主義。故蘇聯對日本之壟斷北满利益。萬難長遠袖手旁觀。</p>
<p>然而目前之蘇聯。遠未得美國之諒解。近復受中歐諸小國之包圍。時時顧慮受法國以下資本主義諸國之經濟封鎖。則社會主義之設建。將感莫大困難。尤恐日法兩國之東西夾攻。更使其無法應付。是以决不輕於挑　。且有時亦對日表示好感。盡其外交手腕之能事。使日本知所顧忌彼運用外交之絶好工具即爲煤油。曾以之聯絡意大利。亦以之結好巴爾幹諸國。即蘇日復交之初步引導。亦以北庫頁半島之煤油爲介也。</p>
<p>而日本近年柴油引擎愈見發達。三島産油。年額不足一百五十萬石。（每石六·四八二七立方尺）而所需揮發油·燈油·輕油·重油·等。總計在一千二百萬石以上。僅揮發油一項。即需三百十萬石以上。而日本出産揮發油不過四十三萬石左右。且油之消費。年年大量增加。日本産油。則難有起色。更有甚者。輸入日本之煤油。大部來自其假想敵之美國。故日本對。北異常危懼。雖屢欲脫此當前危機。卒爲事實所限而中止。雖亦努力增加其内國煤油之生産。但爲天産所限。無從着力。</p>
<p>因此。日本欲借重赤油。已成爲彼國上下一致之趨向。故美蘇未恢復國交之前。前川崎造船廠廠長松方幸次郎。赴巴庫考察油田。表面固爲純粹的考察實業性質。最近方有日本購買蘇俄煤油二十萬噸之電傳。據當前情勢。日購赤油。一則蘇聯運輸工具缺乏。經黑海渡印度洋而東。途程過遠。搬運不便。運費太昂。二則赤油到日。一刻殊不易覓得配給塲所。在日美商務關係未斷絶之前。赤油頗難與美油競爭。然而日本之欲使用赤油。以備將來日美戰爭爆發時之一種有力的準備。故目前試購煤油。其爲數不過二十萬噸。區區之數。又何足道。但其數雖微。在經濟上價値。誠所關甚細。而其間所含政治意義則甚深長。（一）日蘇關係。因北满問題漸趨惡化。彼此雖皆備戰。但皆有所牽制。即日本軍閥。亦不必有侵入西比利亞之决心與實力。故暫時的緩和。借煤油爲介。實爲雙方之便利。（二）英法兩國。讅知日本狡獪。甚欲借國聯組織之力。壓抑日本實行满洲門户開放。利益均沾而日本則一面表示將退出國聯。一面與蘇俄發生密切之經濟關係。入赤油。進一步圖政治上諒解。以威脅法英。其實蘇俄對日好感。亦僅一時利用最後淸算。恐日本亦無法討得便宜。</p>

慰非常，她照預定的時間去接洽，這回她的一腔熱忱，餒了一半，因爲謀事的女士們未到預定時間，已都恭候在行門口了，而且看上去個個精神飽满，十足摩登，經過大班一悉面試之後，就遣散了這班花枝招展的投考員，她回來慢呑呑的踱進了房，我一見她頽喪的樣子，就問她考試的成績，她說這也不能算考，旣不出題目，也不說那位置的職務，第二天下午，Ｋ女士接疊連三的喊道···「好奇怪，老張，你來看！這裏是Ｓ洋行的聘請書，我想不到竟會錄取的。」她說時露出她潔白整齊的牙齒和迷人的笑渦，從此以後，她每天從公司裏回來總是笑嘻嘻的。」　　「Ｋ，你的工作是很輕鬆的吧！」我問。　　「是啊！没有甚麽事情，很淸閑的。」　　過了二個星期竟一點工作也没有了，她的日常公事是每天看完一本英文小說，行中事務旣不繁複爲甚麽要添請女職員呢？她自已也疑惑起來，並且照這欄空睱，也不好意思繼續做下去，她納悶了幾天，終於在一個下午問她的同事丨一位老誠自重的楊先生，他知道她的疑　，可是不便說明，祇謙恭地道：「對不起，行中的事情是大班一手包辦的，致於他用意何在，我是不知道的。「　　第二天·在她辦公室的寫字檯抽屜内，發現了一張白紙，上面寫着：「Ｋ女士，昨天的回答，我知道不能使你满意，但是我竟没有勇氣在你面前剖白，講到行中的事情，我們幾個男職員儘夠分配，大班招請女職員，本來是看作「花瓶」，點綴辦公室的，我不願騙你，所以大膽地告訴你，同時望你不要失望，假使你不願充當「花瓶」，儘可向别處去開拓。」　　Ｋ女士探得内幕，十分憤恨，自然毫不猶豫地向行中辭職，過了幾天，Ｓ行聘請女職員的告白又重露在報端了。　　「這次不知有多少密司們，擠在行門口，巴巴望望要充洋行大班理想中的花瓶呢！」Ｋ女士苦笑着說。瞎三话四莫明其妙的笑  怡怡館主　　　昨天，我走在南京路上，遇見了我的一位老友劉君·綽號敎做「小鬍髭·」因爲他雖則尙是一個年富力强的壯年人·但是他的鼻子之下，嘴唇之上，已蓄有一叢日本紳士式的小鬍髭·所以我們在以前有時敎他做「東洋紳衿，」後來因爲「九一八」的事件，大家痛恨東洋人，未便再敎他做「東洋紳衿」於是大家曾爲了他更改名稱的問題，開了一個緊急會議，綫議定了這個「小鬍髭」的雅號贈他，他竟也默許，不以爲忤。　　這天，我在南京路上遇見他，其時他絜同一位大約十歲左右的女公子走着，我見了問他道：「這位是令媛嗎？」他答道：「是的。」我向她端詳了一回道：「令媛的臉，有些像你哩。」豈知她聽我說她的臉，有些像她的父親。她不禁奇怪道：「咦！我臉上没有小鬍髭啊，你怎麽說我像爸爸呢？」我聽她這般天眞的，而又似乎滑稽的說着，却使我注視了劉君臉上的一挫小鬍髭　笑，劉君　到我的笑，也向我笑了一笑，已有劉君的女公子，望着我們笑，莫明其妙的笑了。</p>

<h3>Fluctuations in Japanese-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>By You Xuan</p>
<p>Japan, taking advantage of the deepening global economic panic and the preoccupation of other nations, as well as China's internal turmoil, seized the three northeastern provinces. However, after occupying them by force, it immediately faced two extremely serious problems: (1) The conflict between Japan and the United States became increasingly acute, thereby promoting the substantive alliance between China and the United States. (2) Between Japan and the Soviet Union, there was previously China as a buffer, which seemed to allow for some mitigation; now, direct confrontation is inevitable. With these two factors, even if Japan forcefully occupies Manchuria, its gains are truly no different from "swallowing a bomb."</p>
<p>Although Japan and the United States are neighboring countries, they are separated by the Pacific Ocean, with the closest point still four thousand nautical miles away. It would seem that conflicts of interest should not be too severe. However, after the European War, both countries became war profiteers. When the global panic struck, they both felt the pain of extremely narrow markets. Opening up new markets also targeted the Republic of China as their sole objective. Thus, the struggle for a dominant leadership position in the market formed an irreconcilable rivalry between the two countries. Japan itself, during the peak of the panic (from the summer of 1931 to early spring of this year), saw its economic contradictions expand daily, to the point of being unsustainable. In addition to opening up new markets, it was especially necessary to give its citizens a new stimulus to divert public attention and forget their own suffering in order to deal with their so-called "national crisis." Therefore, it deliberately fabricated the Wanbaoshan Incident and the Nakamura Incident to enrage its citizens and then sent troops to the Northeast to carry out its militaristic aggression. After gaining Manchuria, it even planned to invade westward into Beiping, Tianjin, and Shandong, making them a second Manchuria. As a result, the American market in China gradually shrank. The conflict with Japan will evolve from economic to political, and it is even possible that a great Pacific war will be triggered by the competition for the Chinese market. Judging from the current situation, both Japan and the United States are doing their best to avoid war, but they are both making preparations, which is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Japan and Russia had old grievances. Although Russia, after a major revolution, temporarily lacked the ability to invade the East, Japan seemed to be able to relax. However, after 1925, the Soviet Russian state became increasingly consolidated. Especially since the implementation of the "Five-Year Plan" in 1928, not only has general industry, with its controlled economic organization, surpassed the scope of the global economic panic, but its heavy industry construction and the enrichment of military industry, as well as the increase in armaments, are far higher than in the Tsarist era. Japanese imperialism is even more wary of this. The fundamental conflict between capitalism and socialism has also intensified due to the construction of Soviet Russia. Japanese military leaders deeply know that the Chinese nation has awakened, and the development of national capital will also break away from the shackles of imperialism and seek self-reliance. Among them, the textile industry is the most obvious. Japan is also a late-developing industrial nation, and its trade with China is mainly in cotton products. Therefore, it spared no effort to suppress the rise of the Chinese revolutionary movement. At the same time, it further hindered the upward development of Chinese national capital. In the Yangtze River basin, it was still somewhat apprehensive due to the complexity of international relations. In the three northeastern provinces, it did not hesitate to act blatantly, using force as a vanguard to implement a policy of plunder. However, Manchuria was originally a tripartite balance of power between China, the Soviet Union, and Japan. The conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union was mediated by China, reducing some difficulties. Since Japan attacked and occupied Shenyang and seized Harbin and Heilongjiang, China's role has been completely lost. The relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union has become directly confrontational. Although there is a so-called "Japanese-made" Manchurian state in between, how could the Soviet Union not know that the so-called Manchurian state is a Japanese appendage? However, since there were no diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, it was able to use the name of neutrality to interact with Japan. And after the establishment of the new Japanese-Soviet fisheries agreement, the war crisis seemed to have passed. Some optimists believed that this was evidence of peace. In fact, it is the opposite. The Soviet Union and Japan are fundamentally opposed and difficult to reconcile. However, since the Soviet Union completed its first Five-Year Plan, it has been marching straight towards the vigorous construction of a socialist state alone. Therefore, it is unwilling to participate in any war between imperialist countries. There is no reason to participate in such wars, and there is no gain. Therefore, since the September 18th Incident last year, it has remained silent. Although Japan and the Soviet Union have always been opposed, in the three northeastern provinces, sometimes there are storms and rains, sometimes there is thick fog, and sometimes it is shrouded in artificially made smoke screens. After all, this is only a temporary phenomenon and has not evolved into reality. Although war will not be realized for a while, the Chinese Eastern Railway is threatened by Japan, reducing its military effectiveness between Chita and Vladivostok. Its economic value is also reduced due to the relationship between the Jihui Railway and the Tao'ang Railway. Therefore, no matter how patient and cautious Soviet Russia is, it feels extreme displeasure. And it will never adopt a policy of non-resistance to the unlimited aggression of imperialist countries. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for the Soviet Union to stand idly by for a long time regarding Japan's monopolization of interests in northern Manchuria.</p>
<p>However, the current Soviet Union has not yet gained the understanding of the United States and is surrounded by small Central European countries. It is always worried about economic blockade by capitalist countries below France, which would cause great difficulties for the establishment of socialism. It is especially afraid of a pincer attack from Japan and France, which would make it impossible to cope. Therefore, it will not provoke lightly. And sometimes it also shows goodwill to Japan, doing its best in diplomatic skills to make Japan aware of its concerns. Its excellent tool for diplomacy is oil. It has used it to connect with Italy and to befriend the Balkan countries. Even the initial guidance for the resumption of relations between the Soviet Union and Japan was mediated by the oil of northern Sakhalin.</p>
<p>In recent years, Japan's diesel engines have become increasingly developed. The annual output of oil in the Three Islands is less than 1.5 million koku (each koku is 6.4827 cubic feet), while the total amount of gasoline, kerosene, light oil, heavy oil, etc., required is more than 12 million koku. Gasoline alone requires more than 3.1 million koku, while Japan's gasoline production is only about 430,000 koku. Moreover, oil consumption is increasing significantly every year, while Japan's oil production is difficult to improve. What's more, most of the oil imported into Japan comes from its hypothetical enemy, the United States. Therefore, Japan is extremely afraid of the North. Although it has repeatedly wanted to escape this current crisis, it has been stopped by the facts. Although it has also worked hard to increase its domestic oil production, it is limited by natural resources and cannot do anything about it.</p>
<p>Therefore, Japan's desire to rely on red oil has become a consistent trend throughout the country. Therefore, before the United States and the Soviet Union restored diplomatic relations, Kojiro Matsukata, the former director of the Kawasaki Shipyard, went to Baku to investigate oil fields. On the surface, it was purely an industrial investigation. Recently, there has been a telex that Japan will purchase 200,000 tons of Soviet oil. According to the current situation, if Japan purchases red oil, firstly, the Soviet Union lacks transportation tools and the route via the Black Sea, across the Indian Ocean, and eastward is too long, making transportation inconvenient and freight too expensive; secondly, it is difficult to find a distribution location in Japan for red oil. Before the US-Japanese business relationship is broken, red oil is difficult to compete with American oil. However, Japan wants to use red oil as a powerful preparation for a future US-Japanese war. Therefore, the current trial purchase of oil, which is only 200,000 tons, is insignificant. But although the number is small, its economic value is very important, and the political significance contained in it is very profound. (1) Japanese-Soviet relations are gradually deteriorating due to the North Manchurian problem. Although they are both preparing for war, they are both constrained. Even the Japanese military leaders do not necessarily have the determination and strength to invade Siberia. Therefore, a temporary relaxation, mediated by oil, is convenient for both sides. (2) Britain and France are aware of Japan's cunning and want to use the power of the League of Nations to suppress Japan's implementation of an open-door policy and equal sharing of benefits in Manchuria. Japan, on the one hand, expressed its intention to withdraw from the League of Nations, and on the other hand, developed close economic relations with Soviet Russia, purchasing red oil, and further seeking political understanding to threaten France and Britain. In fact, the Soviet Union's goodwill towards Japan is only a temporary use. In the final settlement, Japan may not be able to gain any advantage.</p>

<h3>Intense Battles Continue on the Datong Line</h3>
<p>Volunteer Army Recaptures Tongliao and Vigorously Attacks Zhangwu</p>
<p>Tracks Dismantled, Advancing Towards the Zhengtai Line</p>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) After Zhangwu and Tongliao recently fell, the Volunteer Army regrouped with over ten thousand troops and fiercely attacked along the Datong line, resulting in continuous intense battles.

<h3>Shandong War Continues; Han and Liu Each Hold Different Views</h3>

<h3>Han Telegraphed Chiang, Describing the Military Operations</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek on the 27th, saying, "Secretly, Liu Zhennian has occupied Yantai and engaged in rampant oppression, facts that are evident to all. Moreover, he is a cunning and untrustworthy person. Judging from the past, he will inevitably bring disaster to the country in the future. Fuju, in response to the pleas of the people of Jiaodong and to eliminate this source of chaos for the country, had no choice but to act hastily. However, I did not report in advance, because I know that Your Excellency has always been generous and caring for subordinates, often showing leniency. At a time when there are many events, I was deeply concerned that I would not be approved. Also, because I was determined to save the people and could not control my emotions, I hesitated repeatedly. But if it benefits the country and the region, I am willing to sacrifice myself for it. My humble sincerity has always been understood. Fuju knows that I am rough and impatient and act hastily. I should request that Your Excellency impose an appropriate punishment to serve as a warning. According to current plans, the remaining forces of Liu's army, excluding those lost or escaped, are only three to four thousand men, trapped in Yexian, Muping, Laiyang, and other places. It seems that they have no impact on either domestic or foreign affairs. Since receiving the order to cease military activities, I immediately ordered the front to comply, but left a considerable force. Local people also organized themselves and jointly laid siege to the city from outside. The remaining troops gradually returned to defense. According to the commander of the siege, Liu's army in the city often breaks through at night, and escapes are continuous. There have been occasional misunderstandings, but no other battles. All the recent real situation should be telegraphed and presented. I hope that you will understand." (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

The city is already dark and hopeless, and soldiers are rampant and forgetful. If extortion fails, they are beaten. Dozens of people have been beaten. Liu demanded ten thousand catties of iron wire and ten thousand jingles from the Yexian Chamber of Commerce, as well as grain, firewood, coal, straw, cotton clothing, etc. Yexian is very small, and President Dong Yushan could not raise the money and was repeatedly beaten and scolded and committed suicide by jumping into a well. Liu often uses the people's carts as cover, followed by troops taking the opportunity to attack. Yesterday, the enemy used firecrackers in kerosene barrels at night to disrupt our army's eastern defense line. Yesterday, Liu sent many scouts among the refugees who escaped from Yexian to disguise themselves and spy on our army. Several have been captured. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources say that the Japanese government has responded to our country's protest on the 15th, and on the 27th, it was forwarded by our country's ambassador to Japan, Chiang Tso-pin, to our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The content is still simply barbaric, quibbling and making unreasonable arguments, claiming that the Japanese army's actions in the Eastern Provinces are based on legitimate and legal self-defense rights, the establishment of the Manchurian state is due to the free will of the people there and has nothing to do with Japan, Japan is not responsible for the behavior of the puppet organization, and whether Japan recognizes it or not is Japan's freedom, and it does not conflict with the League of Nations administrative council's resolutions, the League of Nations Covenant, the Non-Aggression Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty, and international law.

When Song was leaving, he told reporters that reports that our government would stop paying the Japanese Boxer Indemnity from October were not true. Because Japan instigated the puppet state to plunder the Northeast Customs and carried out various illegal actions, it is closely related to the entire issue of our country's diplomacy with Japan and cannot be negotiated in part first. Even if payment is stopped, it must be decided by the highest central authority. This trip to Lushan is in response to Chiang's telegram call to discuss remedial financial measures and will return to Nanjing in about two or three days.

<h3>Important Foreign Telegrams Guo Taiqi's Speech at the League of Nations Yesterday Called on the Assembly to Note the Importance of the Sino-Japanese Question Herriot to Speak Today on the International Situation The Secretary-General Will Be Succeeded by the Frenchman Avenol Havas Agency, Geneva, 27th After noon, the League of Nations General Assembly convened. Chairman Politis reported that Poland, in accordance with its statutes, requested the right to be re-elected to the Administrative Council. Elections will be held next Monday. After the Chairman's report, general discussions commenced immediately. Australian representative Hughes spoke first, his words similar to those of Van Rela, mainly stating that the League of Nations was undergoing severe trials, that there was no peace without security, and that the causes of war often arose from economic factors. He also stated that the greatest danger faced by the populace was Bolshevism, as its open aim was to destroy our existing culture. Hughes believed that the only remedy for this danger was to restore economic prosperity. Chinese representative Guo Taiqi spoke next, first praising Briand, stating that since China's appeal to the League of Nations, negotiations had proceeded under Briand's direction, and China was very grateful for his method of direction. He also stated that he did not wish to raise the outstanding issues in the special session of the League of Nations and the Administrative Council at today's General Assembly, but one matter could not be left unsaid, namely, that none of the various problems of the League of Nations was unaffected by the Far Eastern situation. Such problems, as proven by experience, should be handled on the basis of freely concluded contracts. Regarding the issue of armaments, Guo stated that China hoped that this matter could be resolved through compromise more urgently than any other country, but that disarmament and security were closely linked, as France had repeatedly stated. China did not wish to become a military power, but desired to strengthen its national defense. Therefore, since the invasion of the Japanese militarists, China had appealed to the League of Nations and hoped that the League of Nations would respond. Guo concluded by stating that China's floods had been disastrous, and that the League of Nations had appealed on its behalf, and that countries around the world had provided assistance, from which China had benefited greatly. He also stated that Geneva's health, transportation, and cultural cooperation were all closely cooperating with the Nanjing government, and that their kindness was deeply appreciated. Guo Taiqi's Speech at the General Assembly Reuters Agency, Geneva, 27th Guo Taiqi, the Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, spoke today at the League of Nations General Assembly, addressing the Sino-Japanese dispute, stating that the relationship between the League of Nations and other countries had never been as close as that with China. The Sino-Japanese question was the most important problem that the League of Nations had to deal with, but the resolution of this problem could not only preserve Manchuria for China but also bring security to the world through the League of Nations. The suffering of the Chinese people could serve as a lesson to the people of other countries, demonstrating the necessity of developing international law. As for the disarmament conference, no country opposed militarism more than China. China considered this doctrine a great scourge. Guo concluded by stating that China had appealed to the League of Nations and the world's conscience, and now eagerly awaited the results. Indian Muslim representative Aga Khan spoke next, also mentioning Sino-Japanese relations, stating that the unpleasant dispute between China and Japan was a matter of deep concern to both the government and the public in India. The government and the public in India deeply regretted that the two major Eastern powers were in this situation, as China and Japan had various contacts with India in terms of religion, culture, land, commerce. He hoped that a solution could be obtained as soon as possible that would be satisfactory to all parties and consistent with the principles undertaken by all members of the League of Nations. The Administrative Council Mediates the Barbo Dispute Reuters Agency, Geneva, 27th The League of Nations Administrative Council sent the following telegram to the governments of Paraguay and Bolivia: "The Council today announces to the governments of both countries that the recent dispute between the two countries is truly regrettable. However, in terms of law and honor, both countries have obligations to the League of Nations and should abide by those obligations, either by submitting the dispute to arbitration, resorting to law, or allowing the Council to handle it, and should not resort to force. The American republics are now strongly assisting both parties to reach a peaceful resolution, and the Council expresses its deep sympathy for this effort and wishes to support it. It is hereby earnestly urged that the governments of both countries support the efforts of the republics and immediately cease all military action and preparations for war. If the governments of both countries can resolutely agree to this request, it will be a practical fulfillment of their promises to all countries and the League of Nations. The Council firmly believes that the governments of both countries, as founding members of the League of Nations, will be able to fulfill their promises in accordance with the law, and hopes that the governments of both countries will provide assurances." The Deputy Minister of Political Affairs Arrives in Japan Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 28th Basdev, the Deputy Minister of Political Affairs of the League of Nations, who is responsible for delivering the Lytton Report to the Japanese government, and Haas, the Secretary-General of the investigation team, and Mr. Sialal, the Minister of Information, who are also on their way home, arrived at Kobe port at 5:00 PM yesterday on the Canadian President. The three immediately disembarked and entered the Toyo Hotel amidst heavy security from the water and land police. They then took the 8:00 PM train to Tokyo and arrived at Tokyo Station at 9:00 AM this morning. Secretary-General Haas told reporters at the station that he could not reveal the contents of the report drafted by the investigation team. He and Mr. Sialal are scheduled to take a ship from Yokohama on the 30th to return to the United States, while Basdev will remain in Tokyo. After receiving a telegram from Geneva and handing the report to the government, his mission will be completed, and then he will return home via Shanghai. Avenol to Succeed as Secretary-General Havas Agency, Geneva, 27th The League of Nations General Assembly has approved the resignation of Secretary-General Sir Drummond. The issue of succession is easy to resolve if the precedent of the International Labour Office is followed; otherwise, difficulties may arise. The reason is that after the death of ILO Director Thomas, Deputy Director Butler of the United Kingdom was promoted. Since no one objected to this matter, the resignation of the League of Nations Secretary-General and the succession of Deputy Secretary-General Avenol of France are the same, and it does not seem to be a problem. Moreover, it is also convenient in fact for Avenol to continue Drummond's duties. The reason is that the League of Nations Secretary-General and the ILO Director are the most important positions in the League of Nations. Since the establishment of the League of Nations, they have been held by the United Kingdom and France. After Thomas's death, the head of the ILO was replaced by a Frenchman for a Briton, so today it seems very appropriate for a Frenchman to succeed a Briton as the League of Nations Secretary-General. In this way, the two important international organizations are evenly divided between the United Kingdom and France, and the status quo remains the same. However, France does not want the nomination of a new secretary-general to involve politics, so it allows it to proceed naturally without any publicity. Other countries also hold the same view and do not want the election to have any special meaning. As for Italy and Germany, although it is possible to give up the right to vote, it is ultimately difficult to use this to make the nature of the election contrary to what the majority of countries hope for. Germany's Absence Disappoints Havas Agency, 27th Geneva The situation of the first day's plenary discussion still cannot reduce the general anxiety of the public. The public's attention is focused on the issue of disarmament. Germany's intentional absence is very disappointing and makes the future of disarmament uncertain. Chairman Henderson used various methods to seek to reopen negotiations between Germany and the major powers, and his ambition is commendable. Henderson plans to contact Heleo, South Latvia, and the representatives of Huie, Arrohi, but the German representative refuses to negotiate for various reasons. Henderson still deals with this situation with an extremely calm attitude. Henderson will meet with representatives of Belgium and the Small Entente in the evening to study how to reconcile the necessary methods of disarmament with Germany's attitude. The results of this negotiation may lead to a cautious and reasonable method that not only does not isolate France, but also expresses its legitimate concerns and its true peaceful psychology. If the organization of security cannot be improved in the coming weeks with a consolidated and grand method, the disarmament conference will fail.</h3>

<h3>Receiving Important Foreign Telegrams Argentina Rejoins the League of Nations Reuters Agency, 28th, Argentina Capital City Telegram The Congress has today passed the motion for Argentina to rejoin the League of Nations with a majority. Japan Uses Films for Propaganda Reuters Agency, 28th, Tokyo Telegram It was learned today that in order for the League of Nations to accurately understand the current situation in Manchuria, the Japanese government will transport 3,000 feet of films about Manchuria to Geneva. This film was produced by the South Manchuria Railway Company while the League of Nations investigation team was investigating. In the future, after it is transported to Geneva, it will be shown to the representatives of the great powers and members of the press from various countries. Absolutely Cannot Recognize the Puppet Organization National News Agency, 28th, Geneva After reading the Japanese Army Minister Araki's interview with the Associated Press reporter, the representatives of the League of Nations were not very surprised, only somewhat shocked by Japan's threat to occupy Tianjin and Beiping. Chinese chief representative Yan Huiqing told the Associated Press reporter that no matter how Araki threatened, he believed that justice could ultimately prevail over might. More cautious people in the League of Nations said that Japan's rejection of any plan to return the sovereignty of Manchuria to China had long been known and was not a secret message. However, it is generally said here that the League of Nations' absolute non-recognition of the puppet organization in Manchuria is no longer a problem because any such action would completely destroy the League of Nations. The General Assembly Will Express Condolences for the Greek Earthquake Reuters Agency, 28th, Geneva At the League of Nations General Assembly yesterday morning, Japanese representative Nagaoka will move that the League of Nations General Assembly express condolences to Greece for the damage caused by the earthquake.

The Prime Minister hopes to recruit Free Democrats from the Simon faction into the Cabinet to fill the vacancies, so that the previous balance of power among the various parties in the Cabinet can still be maintained. National News Agency, 27th, Berlin German newspapers have unanimously expressed regret over the turmoil in the current British Cabinet. The political circles deeply hope that this period of instability can pass as soon as possible, as it will not only benefit the United Kingdom itself but also have a great impact on alleviating the current hardships in the world. The World Economic Conference is about to open, and if the United Kingdom cannot participate due to domestic political unrest, all countries in the world will have even less hope of recovery. Furthermore, regarding the issue of disarmament, the full support of the United Kingdom is necessary to hope for its progress. Therefore, the British government must first be healthy and consistent before it can implement its proposal to actively reduce armaments, and a solution can also be found for Germany's demand for equality in armaments, so that Germany can rejoin the disarmament conference in order to achieve a truly equal level after countries with excessive armaments first make real cuts. Havas Agency, 28th, London There are still seven Liberal Party Cabinet members in Samuel's faction who will resign this afternoon. These seven Cabinet members are Deputy Under-Secretary of State for India Lotan, Deputy Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies Hamilton, Secretary of Mines Ford, and other Liberal Party leaders Ward, McKinsey, Halgou, and Johnston. Reuters Agency, 28th, London Seven more non-executive junior Cabinet members resigned this afternoon. The three Cabinet members who resigned this morning did not attend the resumed Cabinet meeting this afternoon. The Cabinet meeting will discuss three issues: (1) the method of submitting the Ottawa Agreement to Parliament; (2) general issues regarding disarmament; (3) the India issue. Havas Agency, 28th, London Since 10:30 this morning, the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, London, has been crowded with curious onlookers, as the Cabinet meeting is being held inside the Prime Minister's residence to decide the fate of the current Cabinet. More than 30 people with cameras were taking pictures in front of the door, and the police used ropes to create a passage from the crowd so that Cabinet members could enter. Around 10:45, Cabinet members arrived one after another. Paul Baldwin and Chamberlain had already arrived on Downing Street. Simon, Snowden, and Long Ciman arrived successively. Soon after, Minister of Agriculture Gilmour, Minister of Health Young, Minister of the Army Halesing, Minister of Colonies Lister, and Scottish Secretary Sinclair also arrived. The last to arrive was Home Secretary Samuel, who smiled. When Minister of Indian Affairs Hall arrived, it was only five minutes before the Cabinet meeting began. When the Cabinet members arrived, the audience outside the door saluted them calmly and did not whistle. The British Cabinet is holding a plenary meeting for the first time in several months. Mr. Churchill is suffering from a bleeding sore. According to the doctor's report, the bleeding has stopped, and his health is satisfactory, but he needs absolute rest for several days. Investigation Team Report Indicates Japanese Faults Military Action on September 18 Difficult to Recognize as an Act of Self-Defense Full Text of Report to Be Published on Sunday National News Agency, 27th, Geneva The Associated Press reporter has learned from absolutely reliable sources about the contents of the League of Nations investigation team report, stating that the 110,000-word report contains many important articles, one of which is a compromise article determined after a long period of discussion. The article indicates that Japan's attack on September 18 last year was a fault, but the article also clearly states that the investigation team believes that the actions of the Japanese military were based on confidence in self-defense. The wording of the article is roughly as follows: "The investigation team deeply feels that the military action on September 18, 1931, is very difficult to recognize as an act of self-defense, but at the same time, the investigation team cannot, with the same certainty, in the conclusion, completely disregard the Japanese military officers' belief that their military action was an exercise of the right of self-defense." This article was finally passed unanimously after a long period of dispute within the investigation team, which also shows the patience of the representatives of various countries on the investigation team during the discussion. Dentsu News Agency, 28th, Tokyo Regarding the Sino-Japanese solution strategy in the Lytton Report, the conclusion is based on the conditions of (1) retaining only nominal Chinese sovereignty in Manchuria and (2) granting Manchuria a wide range of autonomy rights, and holding direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. The statement is generally correct. However, the Japanese government authorities regard the independence of Manchukuo as an existing fact and will absolutely oppose any plan to change the independent state of Manchukuo. Therefore, if the Chinese side does not recognize the independence of Manchukuo, direct Sino-Japanese negotiations are completely useless. The Japanese will take this tough stance and prepare a written opinion after the Lytton Report is delivered to Japan, and on October 20, Representative Matsuoka will take it to Geneva via Canada and submit it to the League of Nations Secretariat. Reuters Agency, 28th, Geneva The League of Nations Secretariat is preparing to publish the full text of the Lytton Report at noon this Sunday.

It is reported that the French Prime Minister's speech will take on a peaceful tone, as he does not want to use the platform of the League of Nations to engage in a verbal battle with the German Prime Minister. His speech will roughly outline the international situation over the past year. On the political front, he will express regret for the Sino-Japanese dispute and satisfaction that the two South American countries of Bolivia and Bapa have accepted mediation. On the economic front, Herriot will point out how the Sdrachi Conference has helped the reconstruction of Europe. In his conclusion, he hopes that, as in 1924, people from all countries will strive for understanding to overcome current difficulties and express his firm belief in the League of Nations' work in maintaining peace. Havas Agency, 28th, Geneva After attending the meeting of the French delegation to the League of Nations, French Prime Minister Herriot has decided to give a speech on general issues at the League of Nations General Assembly tomorrow. When the General Assembly convenes tomorrow, the Chairman of the General Assembly will be notified of this intention first. Diplomats in Geneva are paying close attention to Herriot's decision. German Foreign Minister Newrath was originally scheduled to return to Berlin tonight, so whether he will postpone his trip is a question of support. Herriot's decision has been unanimously praised by the League of Nations, as the current international situation is clouded, and people generally hope that this French orator can express his grand theory from the podium of the General Assembly to clear the clouds.

<p>Business News and Finance　　Gold Market Extremely Dull　　Market Filled with Leisurely Atmosphere　Yesterday's gold market situation was quite leisurely, and the price fluctuation at most did not exceed two taels. The daily high and low range was only below three taels, ultimately slightly decreasing by one tael. There was also not much trading among dealers. Such a dull state has been rarely seen recently. Initially, due to the limited drop in the silver market, and the lack of supply causing the European market to be stable and firm, it opened with a low. As for foreign exchange, there were no changes, and people's minds were calm. However, at noon, due to some selling by major players, the price once dropped to just over seven hundred and thirty taels, but then recovered. The afternoon trading felt particularly quiet, and because the foreign exchange market was inactive on Wednesday, the price hovered around thirty-two taels. All October swaps to November were traded by Wing Fung, Hang Hung Hing, etc., for dozens of lots, with a premium of four taels. For spot goods, Run Cheong Yu and others sold three to four hundred lots to the Central Bank at a price of thirty-three taels. The daily progress is recorded below:　　Opening Slightly Lower by Seven Mace　The early opening for November was 732 taels and 2 mace, a decrease of 7 mace. Although large bars and American silver decreased by one-eighth, private telegrams only decreased by one-sixteenth, so they were unaffected. Subsequently, there were fluctuations of several mace. Wing Fung, Tai Tak Shing, Hang Cheong, Wing Yuen Tai, and others bought in. HSBC also bought December US dollars at 30.5625, which equals 33 taels.

Citibank also made a purchase of current exchange at 3 yuan, 4 jiao, 4 fen, and 75 li, so by 9:50, it was 32 taels and 8 mace. Shortly after, due to selling by Yee Fung Wing, Yuen Hing Wing, Yuen Mau, Fook Tai Heng, etc., it immediately dropped by 1 tael. At 10:00, it was 31 taels and 8 mace. After a while, news came that the Central Bank was absorbing spot goods, so Run Cheong Wing and others delivered bars, adding 8 mace to reach 32 taels and 6 mace. After this, it remained relatively stable, with only a few mace fluctuations. During this hour, the price was around 32 taels. After 11:15, the buying trend seemed to increase. Chi Fung, Wing Hang Yu, Fook Yu, Kin Cheong Cheung, Tai Hing Wing, Sum Cheong, Wing Yuen Mau, Yu Wo, and others sold heavily. Also, due to interbank trading of January US dollars at 75, the gold price plummeted by 2 taels, reaching 34 taels and 3 mace after 11:30. Later, Yee Fung Wing Fook Cheong bought in, and at 11:45, it was 31 taels and 6 mace. Before long, it decreased by another 3 or 4 mace. By the noon close, it was 32 taels. Because Yuen Hing Wing and others bought more than 100 bars, the price rose to 2 taels and 2 or 3 mace after the close.　　Afternoon Trading Became Even Scarcer　The afternoon opened at 32 taels and 3 mace, increasing from 1 tael and 9 mace to 2 taels and 4 mace, due to purchases by Hang Yu, Yuen Tai, etc. However, the cash flow of various firms was extremely sluggish, and the market was extremely dull.

Yuen Hing Wing bought more and sold less, and arbitrageurs bought slightly. In the afternoon, due to it being Wednesday, the cash flow of various firms was especially lacking. Hang Yu, Yuen Tai, and Yuen Mau bought in slightly, while Yuen Chun and Yuen Tai Wing sold slightly. The transaction volume of various firms was small, totaling about 25,000 taels.　　Afternoon Trading on Wednesdays Started Yesterday　The agents of the brokers at the Gold Exchange had been requesting the Exchange to suspend afternoon trading on Wednesdays for several weeks, and a solution has now been agreed upon by both parties. The manager of Siu Fung Cheong Gold Shop announced the resolution on the floor yesterday morning. According to the announcement, starting today (Wednesday), afternoon trading will open at 2:00 PM and close at 3:30 PM, one hour earlier than usual. After the November 16th swap to the January contract, afternoon trading will be suspended every Wednesday. This is because the banks also lack a foreign exchange market. The Exchange has sent a letter to the Brokers' Association for their information. This letter is being kept by Chi Fung Wing Gold Shop, etc. The agents all expressed satisfaction, so afternoon trading started yesterday, and a dispute has been resolved.Foreign Exchange Without Much Change　　Although the silver market rebounded yesterday, the local foreign exchange market did not tighten. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and the internal prices did not fluctuate excessively. However, due to the dull state of the gold market, the noon close was not much different from the previous night. Trading among Chinese merchants was not quiet.

However, the 1920 Good Customs Consolidated Tax spot goods have been inactive for days, rising two yuan at one point and one yuan and one jiao at another.Bond Category 期現 (Futures/Spot)　前開 (Morning Opening)　　　後收 (Afternoon Closing)　　　較前日 (Compared to Previous Day)　　　成交數 (Transaction Volume)　1926 October Contract ∶∶∶　　　32.10 漲○·四○ (Increased by 0.40)　35,000　Customs Duty October ∶∶∶　　　25.60 不動 (Unchanged)　　　　　5,000　Residue October ∶∶∶　　　26.05 漲○·五○ (Increased by 0.50)　55,000　Troop Reduction Spot 45.50　46.20 漲○·四○ (Increased by 0.40)　　2,000　Troop Reduction October 44.60　45.10 漲○·八○ (Increased by 0.80)　220,0001919 Customs Spot 37.00　∶∶∶　　漲○·四○ (Increased by 0.40)　　1,0001919 Customs October 35.70　36.15 漲○·六○ (Increased by 0.60)　130,0001919 Good Spot ∶∶∶　　　35.20 漲二·○○ (Increased by 2.00)　　2,0001919 Good October 34.15　34.75 漲○·八五 (Increased by 0.85)　165,0001920 Roll October 32.25　32.75 漲○·七五 (Increased by 0.75)　160,0001920 Customs October 32.20　32.50 漲○·六○ (Increased by 0.60)　215,000　Consolidated Tax Spot ∶∶∶　　　34.30 漲一·一○ (Increased by 1.10)　　1,000　Consolidated Tax October 33.30　32.75 漲○·七○ (Increased by 0.70)　415,000　Ample Tax October 14.40　34.75 漲○·六五 (Increased by 0.65)　510,000　Municipal Spot ∶∶∶　　　64.00 無市 (No Market)　　　　35,000New York Stock Market Slightly Rose　　Sin Fung Foreign Firm reported on Tuesday (27th): The New York stock market situation remained chaotic. According to the report, automobile production last week totaled 24,700 vehicles, an increase of 1,700 vehicles compared to the previous week, which slightly improved investor sentiment, and the market gradually rose slightly. Subsequently, American Can Company canceled its extra dividend, which was really sudden. The increase and decrease of various stocks compared to the previous day were mixed. Union Carbide fell by 1 yuan, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph fell by half a yuan, American Tobacco rose by 1 yuan, Canadian Pacific Railway rose by half a yuan, Paramount Pictures rose by 2 jiao and 5 fen, and Fox Film rose by 1 jiao and 2 fen and a half. Trading was very quiet due to the public's wait-and-see attitude. The total daily transaction volume was 1.4 million shares.

However, small retail investors tended to sell, selling whenever the price rose. However, the bullish Rong Hing remained calm, with no intention of letting go. As for the buying demand, although there was a lack of very large transactions, sporadic purchases continued uninterrupted. The bottom stock of various factories remained low, further reassuring buyers. Judging from the current situation, a deadlock has been formed.　　Man Biao Slightly Better by Three or Four Qian　At the opening of the morning session of the Man Biao, the market was weak due to the lack of vitality in raw cotton, and each month fell by two to four qian. The actual sales were still good after the afternoon opening, and the market sentiment rose slightly, with each month rebounding by three, four, five, or six qian. Transactions were very few. The total transaction volume for the day was 7,900 bales. Chang Fung sold 1,200 bales, Ming Tak 550 bales, and Chang Kee 450 bales. Qing Fung bought 350 bales, Jit Fung 300 bales, and Yee Shing 300 bales.

According to statistics, the total purchase volume from various regions for the day was 737 bales. The market situation was similar to the previous day. The purchase volume from each region is listed below:　Guangdong 295　Sichuan 15　Anqing 5　Zhenjiang 10　Inland 65　Xiamen 20　　Ningbo 25　Shantou 35　Wenzhou 15　Trading Firm 10　Yunnan 160　Hankou 2　　Total 737 Bales　Cotton Market Boosted by Spot Sales　　The cotton market initially fell and then rose, but market sentiment remained weak because most people expected prices to fall, and a certain manufacturer released an extremely large volume. Currently, the weather is favorable, and new cotton from various regions is gradually arriving, leading to talk of congestion. Therefore, most people leaned towards a bearish position. However, the demand for spot cotton in the market was still active because various factories had an appetite, mainly due to the high price of foreign cotton.　　Zheng Biao Initially Weak and Then Stable　At the opening of the Zheng Biao morning session, the market sentiment was flat due to the slight fall in American cotton. The second and third plates suddenly weakened, falling by five fen to one qian. In the afternoon, it was reported that spot cotton sales were strong, and each month rose by one qian and five fen to three qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 28,600 dan. Ren Fung sold 2,000 dan, Tung Hing 1,000 dan, and Chang Fung 2,000 dan. Heng Tak bought 1,500 dan, Tai Fung 900 dan, and Jit Fung 800 dan.

Due to the severe drought this summer, the harvest is best, with each mu yielding just over one dan of seed cotton. Inferior yields are only dozens of jin. Currently, farmers are selling new cotton due to economic hardship, so the market is flooded with spot goods, with each dan selling for only about 15 to 16 yuan. Seed cotton is out of stock and there is no market, and prices are expected to continue to fall.American Cotton Fluctuating and Settling Down　　Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to pressure from sellers, then firm due to excessive rainfall, and finally softened again due to arbitrage selling in the South. Futures prices fluctuated by three to seven points. Spot goods were unchanged. British cotton futures fell by nine to ten points. Spot goods rose by one point. Egyptian cotton spot goods were unchanged. Indian cotton was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left.

Due to the extremely tight money supply, trading was dull. Si Jing new indica rice fell by four jiao. The opening price of Chen Po rice in Zhongguan was two chi lower. The appetite of customer groups for Lingbai Jian and new Du Yang Jian was quite scarce, falling by about one chi. The price of Bian Yuan rice, which was sold on consignment, did not fluctuate.　　Xin Zha: The source from the interior was still abundant, and the sales channels to urban and rural areas were deteriorating daily. Over 500 dan of Dan Yang, Li Yang, and Jiang Yin rice in small quantities were sold at 24 chi. New goods from the East and West continued to decline daily.埠 Yang Jian rice was affected by foreign rice, resulting in a decrease of about one jiao. Early rice lacked goods and there was no market. Foreign rice sales were sluggish and continued to soften.　　Yesterday's foreign rice market was even more deserted. Local customers' appetite was weak. The total market only opened 700 to 800 bales. This was because new indica rice and new Jian rice were continuously entering the market later, and many arrived from the river at falling prices. Local merchants generally did not inquire about foreign rice. Various inland routes also had sufficient self-sufficiency. Furthermore, there were reports of a bumper harvest of Wan Xian rice and Jiangbei Xian rice. Recently, many merchants sold Anhui Sheng and Jiangbei routes by train from Beijing to Nanjing, Liuhe, and Anhui Province. The price of packet Xian rice had repeatedly declined, so the foreign rice market was suppressed by it. However, the owners' mentality remained firm and they were unwilling to sell easily. Therefore, the market saw slight weakness of three to five fen, and transactions were even scarcer. 300 bales of small twisted rice were offered at 8 yuan, 3 jiao, 4 fen, and 5 li. 500 bales of Saigon No. 1 rice were offered at 9 yuan and 4 jiao, all of which were handled by local merchants.　　Also, yesterday's newspaper reported that Shun Quan Long Foreign Firm sold 500 tons of this month's Saigon spot goods in Shanghai at a delivery price of 4 taels, 2 qian, and a half. According to a letter from the firm, the transaction price was 4 taels and 1 qian and 8 fen, with a Hong Chang Rice Firm order as proof.Biao Flour Showed Slight Improvement Before Closing　　Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, each month generally showed an initial flatness followed by stability. Because the quotations for foreign wheat in the morning session had a difference of about one jiao, and customers outside the industry felt that the attitude of the manufacturers was quite ambiguous. Foreign wheat had already settled, but they not only did not sell but instead thought of raising the price, so they watched each other, and the transaction became even quieter. When it came to the afternoon opening, it was still flat and there were few transactions. In the last three sessions, a certain major player came out and slightly raised the price, and the market sentiment was relatively stable. However, regarding spot foreign wheat, it was heard that Fook Sing had already settled on another ship of No. 2 wheat at a price of 3 taels, 8 qian, and 4 fen. Therefore, although domestic merchants thought of hoarding, there was no way to prevent foreign countries from continuing to export, and it was impossible to predict the final outcome. As a result, this month was better than the previous day by 5 li, October was better by 7 and a half li, and November to February were each better by 5 li.Period Wheat Initially Flat and Then Healthy　　After the period wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon yesterday, each month generally showed a trend of first being flat and then showing improvement. Although the wheat quotation did not fluctuate, the selling side had to have goods in hand before daring to sell. New short positions generally did not dare to do so. Recently, although spot foreign wheat continued to be settled, they all belonged to</p>

<p>Local News: Baoshan, Chuansha Farmers, Family of Nine Kidnapped.</p>
<p>Initial Ransom Demanded Was 300,000 Yuan.</p>
<p>Now Reduced to 12,000 Yuan.</p>
<p>In the area two li north of Chuansha, Baoshan County, along the coast, lived the late resident Li Jisheng (nickname "Old Foreigner"), originally a poor farmer who suddenly became wealthy.  Recently, the eldest son of Li Jisheng, Fengming, and his entire family of nine men and women were kidnapped by pirates.  It has been over a month, and they are still not safe.  The reason for the Li family's sudden wealth is said to be that a Westerner, carrying jewelry and diamonds, fell into the sea from a ship on the way to Shanghai.  He drifted to the shore and was about to die when he was rescued by Li Jisheng's father.  The Westerner then gave all the goods he carried, valued at over 300,000 yuan, to Li as a reward for saving his life.  This is how the Li family became wealthy, and the nickname "Old Foreigner" came about.  After Li became rich, he used his farmer's instincts and bought hundreds of mu of farmland in Xixiang, Taicang, Kunshan, Penglongzhen, and other places, specializing in renting it out.  Therefore, although he had land, he had little cash.  However, he was very stingy, treating every penny like his life.  His clothes were all made of old cloth, so those who didn't know him didn't realize he was a wealthy man from the eastern countryside.  Li had five sons, the eldest named Fengming, known as "Little Foreigner."  A few days ago, a sailboat suddenly arrived, filled with over thirty pirates armed with guns.  They rushed into the Li family's house.  When Fengming and the others woke up from their sleep, it was too late to escape, and they were tied up.  Fengming's younger brother, Genming, resisted slightly and was shot and wounded.  At dawn, the pirates kidnapped Fengming and his sister-in-law, along with nine men and women (excluding the wounded), took them to the ship, and sailed away.  Later, the Li family received a letter from the pirates demanding a ransom of 300,000 yuan.  Because the Li family did not have this amount of money, they ignored it.  The pirates then sent another letter, automatically reducing the price to 50,000 yuan, asking them to negotiate on a sand island in Chongming County.  The family could not raise the money, so they did not go.  Yesterday, they received another letter demanding 12,000 yuan, to be paid within a few days, or else they would "show no mercy" and "tear up the ticket."  The language was quite aggressive.  The family was very anxious after receiving the letter, but they did not know how this case would end.  Another rumor is that Fengming has already been killed, but this has not been confirmed.</p>

<h3>Yueshan Tao of the Day and Night Bank Should Bear Director's Responsibility</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Judgment by the Higher Third Branch Court</p>
<p>The Shanghai Day and Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Department both went bankrupt after the founder Huang Chu Jiu passed away. Representatives of the creditors, Jing Xiren and Xu Peiyuan, etc., hired lawyers to file a lawsuit in the former French Concession court, requesting that Ye Shantao, Chen Xingwu, Zhou Songqing, Zhao Qinbo, etc., bear the responsibility of directors and shareholders. The judgment against Ye Shantao was rejected in part. Chen Xingwu, Zhou Songqing, Zhao Qinbo, etc., were held responsible as directors and shareholders. Afterwards, the creditors and Chen, Zhou, and Zhao all disagreed with the judgment and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. Several hearings were held. The announcement of the conclusion of the debate and the date for pronouncement of judgment had already been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon was the date for pronouncement of judgment in this case. The appeal lawyers for the creditors, Jiang Yiping, Wang Shizong, Tuiluqing, Xu Yannian, Dong Yu, Dong Chi, Chen Zhigao, Qin Zemin, etc., and the lawyers for the appellees arrived at the court one after another at 2 PM. At 3:30 PM, the presiding judge Lu Yimei, accompanied by judges Zhao Zhenhai and Guo Dechang, arrived at the Civil Third Court and announced the judgment. The original judgments regarding Chen Xingwu and Ye Shantao were overturned in part. Ye Shantao was confirmed as a director and shareholder of the Gongfa Company. The remaining appeals of Jing Xiren and other creditors, and the lawsuit against Chen Xingwu in the first instance, were all rejected. The appeals of Zhao Zengyu (son of Zhao Qinbo) and Zhou Songqing were rejected. The costs of the trial were to be borne one-tenth by Zhou Songqing and the others, and eight-tenths by Ye Shantao and Zhao Zengyu in proportion to their shares.</p>
<h3>Two Jewelry Stores Suspected of Tax Evasion</h3>
<p>Hengdali and Siberia</p>
<p>The customs authorities, suspecting that Hengdali Watch and Diamond Store at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road, and the Siberia Jewelry Store at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road, had evaded taxes on diamonds, jewelry, and watches, sent a letter to the Special District Court on the 27th requesting a search warrant. At around 11 AM that morning, they dispatched personnel to the two stores, accompanied by officers from the Public Concession police and water police, to conduct a search and review the accounts. As a result, it was discovered that some diamonds and other items had no customs documents, worth over 100,000 yuan. After on-the-spot consultation, the items were sealed in the stores' safes pending investigation and further action.</p>
<h3>Chaozhou-Meizhou National Goods Representative Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Chaozhou-Meizhou National Goods Industry and Commerce Joint Association has initiated the organization of a National Federation of National Goods Groups and has sent Chairman Ou Huaqi as a special representative to Shanghai to convene the meeting. It is learned that Representative Ou arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and has already consulted with the China National Goods Maintenance Association and the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association. It has been decided to hold a discussion meeting at the China National Goods Maintenance Association at Nine Acres at 3 PM on Saturday, October 1st, to discuss organizational methods and to send letters to groups in Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Suzhou to send representatives to attend and exchange ideas.</p>
<h3>Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescriptions to Use the Metric System</h3>
<p>Dosage of Medicine Should Be Handled with Caution</p>
<p>Three Groups to Discuss Jointly</p>
<p>Since Shanghai City switched to the metric system, only the gold and silver industry and the pharmaceutical industry have not yet adopted the new system. A few days ago, the Municipal Education Bureau forwarded a letter from the Municipal Social Bureau, informing the China, Shenzhou, and Shanghai National Medical Associations to instruct their members to switch to the new system for prescriptions. Yesterday, the China National Medical Association convened the Shenzhou and Shanghai academic groups to discuss the matter. All agreed that the implementation of the new system should be based on the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry must implement the system on a fixed date so that doctors can revise the weights and measures accordingly to avoid discrepancies and errors. A draft was immediately prepared and submitted to the relevant authorities for instructions on the conversion standards, and it was requested that instructions be issued to the meeting two weeks before the implementation of the new system so that the medical community in Shanghai could be informed and comply with the new system.</p>
<h3>Internal Dispute Among Victims' Association at Cotton Cloth Exchange</h3>
<p>Mutual Attacks Lead to Litigation</p>
<p>Sha Weiyi, Ming Jingheng, Chen Rongcai, Wang Shengsun, etc., previously had disputes with the China Cotton Cloth Exchange over settlement prices. Sha and others organized the Shanghai China Cotton Cloth Exchange Victims' Joint Association to jointly deal with the matter. Later, Sha and others suddenly had disagreements and turned against each other, attacking each other in the newspapers, resulting in litigation. Sha filed a criminal complaint against Ming, Chen, and Wang in the First Special District Court for defamation, requesting that they be punished according to the law. Ming Jingheng and others hired lawyers Ye Fukan and Liu Shixiong to defend themselves, arguing that after the lawsuit between the customers and the China Cotton Cloth Exchange was judged, it was decided by the public that the judgment would not be published in the newspaper. Sha was also present at the meeting, but he had ulterior motives and was willing to curry favor with foreigners. On August 2nd, he went to the meeting and advocated using foreign capital to finance the association, which was rejected by the resolution. Before long, Sha, without authorization, published the unconfirmed judgment in the newspaper for personal gain, undermining the public interest of the group and violating the charter and resolutions, which was of great importance to the future of the lawsuit. Therefore, they had to stand up and defend themselves and deny it in the newspaper. This is what the plaintiff calls defamation. Later, the plaintiff also published a newspaper to threaten them with a lawsuit. The association then expelled him from membership. It was found that the plaintiff was unable to pay the membership fee, so why did he suddenly have such a large amount of money for newspaper advertisements? It was obvious that he was being used by others and had a different background. This was not an intentional accusation. The plaintiff used to donate 30 yuan to the association, which he still has not paid. Finally, from a legal point of view, all the actions of the defendants do not constitute defamation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu held a hearing. The plaintiff, Sha Weiyi, did not attend, but was represented by lawyer Ma. The defendants only attended Ming and Chen. After the facts of the case were questioned in court, the hearing was adjourned to the 13th of next month.</p>
<h3>Record of the Trial of Sun Qiying</h3>
<p>Judgment to be Pronounced on the Afternoon of October 4th</p>
<p>In the case of lawyer Sun Qiying being accused of embezzlement, Chief Judge Qian Chengjun of the Criminal Court continued the hearing yesterday afternoon. The witness, lawyer Zhang Binqiu, was summoned to testify, stating that in March, Sun Qiying accompanied him to the office of lawyer Gong Tongyuan, saying that due to the Guo Shiliang lawsuit, the issue of public fees could not be resolved until 180 yuan was paid on April 30th, which was canceled by Guo Shiliang. The public fees were 106 yuan, and the rest was unknown. The witness Sun Binsheng testified that Guo Shiliang entrusted Sun Qiying to file a lawsuit, and he and Cao Tianran went together. He signed the contract as a witness. At that time, the public fee was discussed as 30%, which was later reduced to 250 yuan. It was established on August 7th last year. Cao Tianran stated that Sun Binsheng did not go with him, only he and lawyer Sun signed the contract. The public fee was not specified, but the verbal contract was 30% of the amount received. Guo Shiliang stated that 180 yuan was received. After Sun Qiying was arrested, he gave him 82 yuan, which is now considered paid. Sun Qiying stated that when the case was entrusted, Cao Tianran came first, and Sun Binsheng came later. However, the contract should have a witness, so he asked Sun Binsheng to be a witness. The official then questioned Sun Qiying and Sun Binsheng separately, and all the trivial matters were consistent. At this point, prosecutor Xie Lian was invited to the court to give his opinion, stating that according to the Supreme Court's precedent on the crime of embezzlement, no matter what happens in the future, the crime is established. In this case, the defendant disregarded his credibility and claimed that the actual public fee was 250 yuan. However, the total amount was more than 200 yuan, so embezzling one yuan is also embezzlement. Based on the result of the lawsuit, the amount was 300 yuan, and the public fee was filled in as 250 yuan. According to the witness's statement, there is still suspicion of alteration or reconstruction. However, the embezzlement occurred before March 5th, which is in line with the amnesty regulations, so a reduced sentence is requested. The use of the altered document occurred after March 5th, so it is requested that a judgment be made in accordance with the law. The defendant's defense lawyer argued that the case money, according to civil law, is detained on behalf of the party concerned and is naturally not a crime. The contract naturally has a note of the public fee. At that time, the request was for more than 1,000 yuan, and the public fee of 250 yuan was not much. It is requested that a verdict of innocence be given. Then the prosecutor stood up again and argued, announcing the conclusion of the debate, and scheduled the judgment to be pronounced at 2 PM on October 4th.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Thieves Who Stole a Large Amount of Raw Silk</h3>
<p>Three Large Packages of Stolen Goods Recovered</p>
<p>Five large packages of raw silk, worth over 5,000 yuan, were stolen from the Jiangsu Bank warehouse on Guangfu Road along the Suzhou River in Zhabei a few days ago. The case was immediately reported to the Fourth District Headquarters for arrest. Yesterday, Wang Shifu, the leader of the detective team of the headquarters, learned that the thief in the case, Dong Fugen, was hiding in Xing Deli, Yaojia Stone Bridge. He led detectives Li Guiqing, Xie Qihua, Fang Chaofu, etc., to arrest Dong. Under questioning, Dong confessed that his accomplice, Jiang Da, was hiding on Taiyangmiao Road and that part of the stolen goods were hidden in the countryside of Zhenru. He then escorted Dong and Jiang to recover three large packages of the stolen goods one after another. District Officer Zhu took the case for preliminary planning. Dong, a native of Yangzhou, confessed that he was a porter at the warehouse and conspired with Jiang Da to steal. Jiang confessed that he used to be a foreman at the warehouse and that the idea was Dong's. It was judged to be handed over to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Reasons Why Xinghua Dried Longan Cannot Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Military Troops in Fujian Province Destroy Commerce</p>
<p>Xinghua dried longan is a famous local product that has been on the market for many years. This year, the third brigade of the Provincial Defense Army in the area, led by He Xianzhu, created a dried longan tax, levying three yuan per bag. Merchants opposed it, and the dried longan that was being loaded onto the ship was detained by He Xianzhu, causing it to be delayed in arriving in Shanghai. A few days ago, it was reported that the merchants in the area, due to the relationship of their capital, painfully paid the tax and a fine of 15,000 yuan to settle the matter. It was initially thought that the first batch of dried longan could arrive in Shanghai within a few days, but unexpectedly there was another incident. According to a telegram received yesterday by the Xing'an Guild Hall in Shanghai, He Xianzhu claimed that although the merchants had paid the tax and fine, they secretly used merchants in Shanghai to file a complaint and oppose them, and detained the Xu'an ship that was transporting the dried longan. The merchants in the area are now unable to pay any more and have gone on strike and closed the market, requesting that higher authorities resolve the matter. It is heard that merchants in Xianyou will also respond due to their vested interests. After this, the commerce of Xinghua and Xianyou counties will be unbearable.</p>

<h3>Pre-Announcement of the Chinese Medical Association Meeting</h3>

<h3>Ma Qingyuan Repents to Yang Hucheng</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A person from Xi'an stated that Ma Qingyuan was originally an old subordinate of Yang Hucheng. The reason for Yang's resolution of Ma's forces this time was that there was an undercurrent between Ma and other subordinates of Yang, which was entirely due to misunderstandings. Ma has now telegraphed Yang, expressing his repentance. Yang replied to Ma, saying that they have been comrades-in-arms for many years, and at this time of national crisis, they must not lose unity and hoped that he would return to the fold. Ma will arrive in Xi'an in a short period of time. Regarding the post-settlement issues of Ma's forces, since not many soldiers from the troops in Tianshui and other places scattered with Ma, it will not be difficult to reorganize them. Ma may no longer take the original position of division commander and will come to Nanjing from Shaanxi to meet with Jiang in Lushan and explain everything. In the future, the central military authorities may give Ma a suitable position. (Special Dispatch on the 28th)</p>
