<h3 id="c38">嚴重時期國人應有之覺醒彬 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>人有恒言曰。［無敵國外患者國恒亡。］東北禍變爆發。至今已三閲月。崇朝間陷落半壁山河敵人鐵騎。且咆哮而西來。此一擊。不能謂非我民族之致命巨創以常理言。此一擊。亦應足以醒我二十年來混殺一團之民族。相與洗心革面。共謀自存之道而事實上竟攘奪者如。故紛爭者如故。三月來外患愈緊急。國是愈混亂。若無國家無政府日畏亡國而日疾步邁進於亡國之路當禍變初發。政治家昭示人民曰。外患由於内亂是必改組政府。是必澄清政治。於是而言者動者都以此爲鵠的。終於政局應時勢之推移而急轉直下。舊者忿忿而去新者欣然而來來則如何。曰爲國。國之艱難猶是曰爲民。民之苦痛猶是。然則究爲何。或其爲作擲升官圖之兒戲内政無辦法。外交無辦法。養疴者養疴。優遊者優遊。口言團結而北轍南轅。糾紛日多口言和平。而相互之猜忌日顯。日新政府已成立矣。而政治無重心。政府無責任。一切散漫混亂。較前更甚。然則新政府究爲何而新。是即某先生所謂。［你不好·打倒你·我來</p>
<p>做·］一之意湯擔矣。藥則猶是。人慾横流。國難非所顧惜。而猶昭示人民曰。此爲刷新。此爲革命夫誰欺欺天乎。此亡國之一道也</p>
<p>以言軍人。中國養兵。一若專爲助長内亂。對内則齒還齒目還目厮殺之勇即曾參加歐戰之歐人。亦爲之昨舌。但外患一來。則望風而退。任敵長驅直入。瀋陽之失。尙可謂爲變起倉猝。事先無準備。而今錦州則又何如。全師而退。任無統帥無糧秣無子彈之義勇軍。及所謂［土匪］如小白龍之流。與敵血戰。今且灤河之師盡撤。敵又迥騎以向熱河。東北旣已通電宣稱不作政治之犧牲品。關内各省之軍隊。亦都任敵騎咆哮縱横。任疆土日被蠶食鯨呑。而有如越人視秦人之肥瘠。漠然不加喜戚。而且新的對立醖釀日益成熟。所謂西南政委會。所謂北平政治分會。以及一切其他鈎心鬥角之事實。都明白昭告人民以新的割據之局面巳成。巨砲之轟擊。竟不能擊破野心軍人政客之權利迷夢。擁兵皆爲攘奪皆爲禍國。皆爲殃民。二十年如一日。國脈民命。皆操持於若輩之手。此則亡國之道又一也。</p>
<p>以言外交。五年以來日唱革命外交。名詞固極新。穎而動聽。然而亦不過新穎動聽已耳。按其實際。則不可說。不忍說。新政府成立。新外交當局日。打破國難。當用外交手段。手段則如何。人民引領以望。錦州又陷落熱河又告急手段仍不可聞。不可見。如曰有之。應亦不過爲以夷制夷。拒前門虎迎後門狼之一貫的外交政策。是則又一亡國之道也。</p>
<p>内政如斯。外交如斯。洪水慘災。無法救濟。外患日急無法應付國欲不危安能得。欲不亡又安能得。</p>
<p>吾民衆忍坐視國家之淪亡。種族之覆滅乎。如其不忍則奮起自救。此即其時。自救之道爲何。日督責政府本人民之公意。積極着手於禦侮救災收復失地。如其不能則是政府自暴露其無能。不足以負荷處理國難之重責。人民即應找尋新的奮。鬥之途徑。斷不容坐以待斃。引領以待宰割。政府旣不欲負荷抗暴救國之重責。我人民决不作亡國之人民。國人其急起。其速尋覓新的奮鬥之途後。若徒作無謂之呼籲與期待。中國將永無旦時。</p>

<p>引起巴黎方面震駭</p>
<p>法財長佛蘭亭發表一文　　聲稱莊嚴契約寗容破壞</p>
<p>▲路透九日柏林電德總理白魯寗昨告英大使、德國在賠欵大會中將要求取銷賠欵、今日復發表一文、内稱、德國繼續繳付政治賠欵、乃不可能事、渠信今日無人不知必在所需之後果、今不得不奮發勇氣、不容經濟難題爲政治考慮之事件、巴塞勒會議之報告、已表明德國所受之戰事慘果、並承認德國所已採行之極端計畫、以抵抗其艱局者、乃近代史中所未前有之辦法、此報告書又表明僅僅德國一方面計畫、無濟於事世界金融困難有增無减、其致此之原因、大都爲德國之地位、是以德國不得不切實要求各政府即立採行聯合行動云、白魯寗又謂德國之無力付債、德國賠欵與世界現狀間之密切關係、及楊格計畫據以成立的情形、今已有如何透澈之變更、巴塞勒大會報告書固已證明之矣、德國政治賠欵之繼續、已爲德國局勢所不可能、苟有維持此項賠欵之謀、則勢必造成不獨德國且亦全世界之劇刦、德國允法國所提出英國所贊同洛桑賠欵大會於一月二十五日舉行之議、德政府在其所可採之態度事件上、别無所擇亦無其他辦法唯有在大會中陳述眞相而請有關係之他國政府考慮現狀、勿試作調解辦法、蓋此種可能性現已不復存在矣云、</p>
<p>▲路透九日巴黎電白魯寗之言論、已引起巴黎之震駭、議院中人今日一致承認此種發展之嚴重、一般人多謂德國决計否認其在楊格計畫下之義務、致使洛桑賠欵大會成無益之舉、債權國應立即會商共同態度、榻格計畫固規定如德國賴債、可訴諸海牙國際法庭也、政界中人皆謂在德總理此舉中、彼等可見國家社會黨希特勒之手腕、財政部長佛蘭亭發表一文、謂白魯寗之言、如所傳果確、直謂德政府欲取銷楊格計畫與凡爾賽和約耳、自由簽定之約文、法人决不容其片面取銷、而破壞法國對於賠欵之莊嚴權利也、世界恐慌之劇烈、及政府間付欵辦法、現有修改以期渡過難關之必要、固無人否認之、法政府刻正爲此事工作、並以甚和緩精神研究債權人與債務人所可恊定以抒困難之方案、但若對於契約加以新攻擊、致使難關愈臻糾紛、則徒使此難關莫可越過而已、此舉之唯一結果、無非使人更不能投資云、</p>
<p>▲國民九日柏林電昨日白魯寗面告英大使、德國無力再付賠欵、於是德外部在柏林立即否認外報所載白氏與英大使談話、但消息靈通者則信德外部所否認者、不過英人記載該談話之措辭耳、至白氏曾請英大使注意德國之無可籌欵以付賠欵、則係事實無可懐疑、未幾白氏果有向報界之談話云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯九日柏林電據政界宣稱、白魯寗並未向英國大使宣言德國不再繳付補償欵項、如外國報紙所云、白氏與英大使晤談甚久、僅謂按之德國所處境地、此際實無法繳付補償欵項、即他日恐亦無繳付之力、據德國人士意見、白魯寗之宣言非如外國電報所載、具有絕對性質、並謂德國政府對於此事、將於最短時期以内决定態度云、</p>
<p>路透九日紐約電紐約銀行界今日未因德總理所發表德國不復能償付賠欵之宣言而形驚擾、某著名銀行家謂此宣言之原意、在故作奢望、以便磋商耳、渠料將來總可議定一種付欵方法、縱恊約國拒付其欠美之戰債、亦不足使美國大感困苦蓋債務問題一經解决、貿易當可迅速復興、而美國在貿昜興盛時所可獲者、將倍蓗於債欵之數量也、</p>

<p>— 石顏也</p>
<p>金山有孫君。前任馮庸大學敎授。後赴日本士官校習軍事。頃以國難歸國。聞其談中日軍力狀况。略述如下。日本男子年逹二十二歲即編入行伍。受軍事訓練。期以兩載。退伍爲後備軍人。一旦國家有事。軍部令下。即應調出征。惟一達四十一歲。即兵役期滿。無衝鋒陷陣之義務矣。現日軍現役軍人合此二十四至四十歲之後備兵。共不過三百萬人。此爲其主力軍。區區之數。不足畏也。</p>
<p>日本軍械甚富足。在士官練習打靶之彈。上皆有大正某年字樣。末見有昭和二字者。日前賊擾天津檢獲之彈。亦爲大正五年製。其貯藏之富。已可槪見。雖其國内少戰禍。無須乎此。然留以有待。正足見其野心也。</p>
<p>我人於日軍未到。即聞風而走。一若日軍如虎之可畏。實則彼之技術。亦至平常。體質之强。無所傳之盛。智力亦不勝我人。或且下之。赴士官留學。必先在其軍隊中實習六閲月。體質相較。彼此彷彿。敎學一切。日人未明。而我已先熟習矣。五三濟南之役。據在濟之我師長某君言。日軍實一紙虎。戰術之劣。一觸即知。吾人徒震其盛名。遂言戰色變矣。</p>

<h3 id="c154">馬永貞與黄牙鬚 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>中國拳術。向分少林與武當兩派。少林以剛勝。武當以柔勝。江湖賣藝之流。都從少林入手。四十年前之馬永貞。即少林之健者也。余糼時猶得見之。馬在申賣藝於北石路（即北福建路）堅黄旗一面。太書脚踏黄河四海。拳打南北兩京。以自示無敵。法捕頭黄牙鬚。歐西拳術家之國手也。携舌人趨馬前。欲試好身手。馬笑却之。黄疑其怯堅請比試馬解釋中西拳術之不同。倘一失手。而肇禍。余不負責舌人轉告黄。堅恃不允。馬日姑試之。彼此足踏瓦片。勾食指以賭力。何如。黄日諾。如法而比較之。剛一勾指。黄所踏之瓦片均碎。面紅耳赤額汗涔涔下。觀者已知馬之情讓。而黄之難堪矣。時石路天仙戲館之守門人某甲。齊魯間人身長七尺。拳大如斗。固孔武有力之老宿手也。聞馬之　傲思有以窘之。伺於馬側者數日矣。一日瞥覩馬與徒打揮之時。探囊取繩穿之百文錢遥擲馬。馬覺腦後有風。側避之。中徒耳根。皮微破。馬償然日。大丈夫從無暗箭傷人者。倘有健者。曷不挻身一比。命徒買洋皮紙。手持紙角。立十步外。馬揚言於衆日。若之硬功。已臻絕頂。余能以陰功尅之。且觀余之小技也。言罷。戟一指遥指之。紙忽洞穿。觀者鼓掌。擲手如雨下。某甲覩狀。知非所敵。濳退出選歸。余時剛十二齡。目覩其狀至今想之。猶歷歷在目也。務。參謀部任軍隊支配等事。而軍隊之出發。必得軍令部之命而後行。參謀部軍令部皆直屬天皇。不受内閣支配也。</p>
<p>我國軍人總數。據某軍事專家言。全國實有二百二十萬外。以言槍。則無此數。一人不獲一槍也。子彈毫無積存。皆耗於内戰矣。平均每兵至多分配得二百顆。苟舉行總攻擊。則一日即傾。羣嘆空空矣。對日宣戰。論雙方現役軍人。我儘足對付。惟日有二十四至四十歲之後備兵。我亦不能不急練義勇軍以爲後盾。彈缺不足畏。引之登陸。與以肉搏。必能殲之也。　　以余所聞。有爲孫君所未知者。我國北方民間。十九有槍。且有相當子彈。聞海州一地。即有五萬枝。則舉北方所有。當不下數百萬枝。彼輩藏槍之法。係以燭油澆灌槍隙處。外亦以油敷之。如一蠟槍。埋藏地下、歷數載可不銹敗。一旦有事。起而去其油可矣。故余謂今日之義勇軍應速在北方招集。彼輩有槍。有彈。有訓練。勁旅頃刻可集也。</p>

<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>徐鏡我。一書賈耳。寓滬設書攤於福州路之昇平茶寮下。時餘杭章太炎。四川鄒威丹提倡排滿。革命之盡盛行。而售者輒爲偵吏所目。至不敢陳列。徐獨羅致無少遺。怡然也。故每至燈火已上。圜而立者濟濟焉。蓋醉心於此種書籍者。皆爭購之。而其營業亦於是獨旺。</p>
<p>徐操甬音。體服碩。穿西服。而性頗滑稽。出言恒能博人歡。其出身實不知其爲何。生女二。時女界方尙短襖隻袖長裙以爲美觀。彼皆截髮蓬蓬然覆諸兩肩。一如今日之時髦女子然。開風氣爲獨先。余與亡友汪指衡。常喜與之談。一日。有日人某至。固亦與彼稔者徐逎指而數之日。［今憂時者。顧知防俄之爲亟。比諸虎狼之秦。不知二十年後更須防此鼠輩也］。聞者咸匿笑不已。而某亦有愧色。至今憶之。而佩徐有先見之明。歎爲不可及。</p>
<p>嗣爲忌者所報。江督端方購之急。滬之坐探米占元。以徐解省。鞫之。幾不免。有爲道地者。謂徐號［野雞大王］。一無賴流亞耳。奚革命爲。遂得釋。蓋滬上游戲采風同文各小報。競開花榜。而徐以避邏者之目。亦曾爲么鳳之座師。不謂此花國之閒情。亦爲明哲保身之計也。鄒威丹庚斃後。無人敢爲之葬。閔行劉三。斥良田三畝。徐出經紀其事。其高義有如是者。今能道及者已尠。故余述之。</p>

<p>民國北平。刋有萬松野人言善錄。開章說。這幾年來。人心險詐。風俗敗壞已甚。凡是那老成君子。端正好人。無不目擊神傷。要想各樣法子出來維持。法子雖不同。到底都是一番救世的苦心。然而這其間最多數最普通的一宗輿論。總是說没有宗敎不能成國問他何以不能成國呢。他說宗敎有一種約束人心結合團體的能力。問他何以有此能力呢。他說宗敎因有迷信故也。但迷信是要不得的。就如世俗的善書上勸人作善。竟有救蟻中狀元之選。埋蛇享宰相之榮的話。衆位細想一個狀元的身價。不過是幾個螞蟻換的一個宰相的尊榮。不過因一條蛇得的。再者秦檜嚴嵩都是狀元宰相。又是作什麽好事積的因果呢。所以趙雲松有詩云。世儒好闢佛。多欲窮其精。我但言其粗。了然自易明。其敎嚴戒殺。物命固長成。卻絕男女欲。不許人類生。將使大千界。人滅物滿盈此豈造化理。流毒逾秦坑。試起廣長舌。將以何說爭。或日倘無輪廻果報。豈不灰君子爲善之志。縱小人作惡之情麽。况古來如顏回之天。盜跖之壽。降祥降殃之理未免顚倒。又何以慰人的心。平人的氣呢。日此等理狠不難講。比如古人稱頌文王的盛德。竟有於昭于天。在帝左右等語。若桀紂的窮兇極惡。也能合文王同等同列麽。必不然罷。不然則必在反對的地步了。明末清初有個魏叔子。在儒林中。也是個狠有名望的。他曾作過地獄論前後四篇。雖不十分了澈。到底也算有意思了。他大意說的是世間刑賞亂。善惡淆。惡極罪重的人。或是考終以死。即如曹操秦檜等的奸賊。楊廣完顏亮等的淫逆。國家的刑罰。至於凌遲而止。剛狠之人。愍不畏死。又當如之何。况且他們又多未遭世上刑罰。所以必當有個地獄。呌他求死不得。展轉於刀鋸鼎鑊之中。百千萬年而無已時。干請賄賂無所謀。孝子慈孫不能代。惡報極於其身。株連不及他人。嗚呼。至矣。盡矣。又日。余篤信地獄爲事理所必有。而誦經崇佛。消災滅罪。爲事理所必無。倘崇佛可以滅罪。則勢力之家不妨窮兇極惡但出其十一之資。即可免罪。是佛乃狥情干請之惡棍刁紳。佛且當坐地獄中首席矣云云。然則迷信二字。救世救不了的。郭君輔庭殆亦端正好人而欲維持世道人心者擬重刻陰隲文圖證以醒世。其書之好在有圖畫。雖不識之無者亦可見而自警。老人故樂引野人之說。以塞其請。</p>

<p>馬來亞技藝、早爲海上球迷所欽佩、而東華人才、亦屬一時英俊會師之議一定、金神父路畔、頓見車水馬龍、棒球塲内遂成人山人海、鬥熱盛况、不在東華與諾森堡複賽之下也、六角座劵八千八百二十七張一元座劵、一千三百二十五張、共計一萬零一百五十二張（約收入洋五千七</p>

<p>馬來亞生長於熱帶之下、非如東華之慣於峭寒、一旦身處朔風嚴冷中、便覺筋骨瑟縮、初時尙能抵抗、久則因寒受冷而得之腿筋屈痛者四五人、遂由平等優越之地位、一降而成受迫之局勢、終致二對四之屈服、非戰之罪、實嚴冷之氣候有以致之也、關於全隊技能、奔跑頭頂、我其特長、各個工夫、守門黄錦柏身手敏捷、救險無數、左右内鋒關信德謝金福脚頭銳利、逢隙必進、中鋒李文傑善於冲擊、因受屠開元之監視、進展乏衝、簡德輝之中堅、極有作爲、下半時改調黄克厚、中部轉呈隙空、乃予東華活動機會、兩内衞許錦堂余焯華頭頂、堅硬如鐵、往往在排山倒海中、嚴守不屈、左翼劉金融較右冀鄧夏二人有生色、鄧氏之技則出於夏氏之上、兩前衞平平、全盤局勢槪觀、上半時咄咄可畏縱横自在、下半時偏安一隅、進展乏衛、</p>
<h3 id="c166">東華隊勝利由來 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>東華勝利、一因敵方氣候不慣、而全隊表演精美、則有口皆碑、屠開元之中堅、日見神化、已成近今華人中之第一流中堅、陳璞老練、陳家球靈巧、前衞綫之特才金元謙堅硬有餘、智巧不足、然而東華第三第四兩球、均接聞由其造成、可稱福將、李寗關泃安進退有致、堅如銅牆鐵壁、守門周賢言略有驚惶、然大處尙無弊病、功過相抵、戴隣經上半時在敵方簡德輝嚴密追隨之下、無甚表見、下半時換以他人、則出没自由矣、一次騎馬射箭之打門、誠令人呌絕、李義臣脚頭有力、動作欠速、陳洪光冲勢甚傑、勇武過人、陳虞添有作有爲、矯健依然錢敬鏞無甚進步、且時犯越位之病、東華轉機、在調陳家球代李義臣、前鋒五將乃迅速無比矣、</p>
<h3 id="c167">上塲時馬來受驚 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>銀笛聲起、馬來亞大軍進攻、關洵安二次頂出、險象方去、東華乘勢反擊、守門黄錦柏首當其衝、力禦强敵、戴中鋒得陣虞添之供給對門射擊、黄氏隨手接去、繼而錢敬　踢角、落點適中黄氏又自内撲出、李義臣進冲、陳洪光隨勢打門、黄氏再力救得安、黄氏表演驚人、全塲贊美、</p>
<h3 id="c168">觸門柱東華無恙 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>從此馬來亞勢盛、球由左部帶入、關信德挑落中央、李中鋒飛步進龔周守門見勢不佳突出救之、斯時馬來亞包圍之勢已成左攻右擊前撲後進十五分鐘時、鄧右翼挑中關信德撥過人後、周守門撲空、一球忽切上門柱、龍門竟告無恙、此球不失、勝利之預兆也、陳右翼乘隙入侵、黄守門撲出、洪光再進、黄氏處置得法馬來亞又來、關信德射門、周守門接而復落、李中鋒進撲、周守門臥地擋之方告平安、</p>
<h3 id="c169">五分鐘内起變化 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>二十三分鐘時陳洪光在敵陳中、撥球予李、李義臣盤球進展、猛然一脚、直向門去、黄守門擋之過遲、馬來亞遂告失守、反顧之間、馬來亞五虎相繼光臨、謝金福平地一脚、周守門欲救不及、五分鐘内、各得一球、可謂極滄藥之變矣、</p>
<h3 id="c170">上半時各二和局 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>東華經此一變、激動軍心、前鋒互傳進取、戴中鋒施用巧計、黄守門突出破之、且見工夫、李義臣繼之攻門、又被守門擋住、馬來亞謝金福一球、又中門柱、反彈出險、戴氏避人耳目自右挑中、陳虞添打中守門身上幾度掙扎、猝見屠中堅大腿飛足碰然一聲、切門柱進網、東華乃以二對一占先、局勢又變馬來亞取攻勢、關李嚴守、數分鐘後、鄧右冀傳中、關住德順攻門、應聲中的、造成上半時二對二和局、</p>
<p>馬來亞與東華合影（輝光攝）</p>
<p>▲再戰中東華占勢</p>
<p>再戰聲中、馬來亞受氣候影鄉、表演减色、同時東華前鋒較前敏捷、四十五分鐘之内、多半在攻擊之中、要非内衞健全守門穏妥、大局不堪設想、在十分鐘時、東華曾受一次驚嚇、卒由周守門抛出、嗣後陣家球陳洪光相繼猛擊、一遇黄守門、志不得逞二十四分鐘陳洪光方中一球、未幾、陳洪光俯身以頭迎球、又見黄守門撲住、最後戴中鋒以騎馬射箭之姿勢、打中一球、結果四對二勝、</p>

<p>病］的［要人］及［次要人］，假如有人加以調查統計，至少總在一打以上。國家是這樣的多難，要人們又是這樣的多病，這眞是［昊天下弔福不雙至，禍不單行。］</p>
<p>馮玉祥先生一向身體很强健，這次爲着［共赴時艱］，毅然南來，馮先生到上海的時候，大小各報都說馮先生［面</p>
<p>色豐膄，精神翊翊］，可是他一到上海，便也很迅速的病起來了，他七日電國府主席林森說；［祥在滬養疴，現尙未</p>
<p>大痊，正在調攝］。呵，馮先生又病了，上海灘上又多了一個［病］的［要人］。　　馮先生眞的病了嗎？有人說；前兩天同馮先生在某處吃飯，眼見他食量兼人，聲音洪喨，精神抖擻，毫無病象］</p>
<p>；有人說；［前天下午四時十五分馮先生還曾去霞飛路納爾醫院慰問汪精衛先生的病，談了半個多鐘頭；］又有人說；［馮先生七日寫信給他的舊時袍澤，還殷殷以體力必須健壯鄭重致囑。］假如馮先生病了是事實，那末上面這些消息當然是非事實，反之假如這些消息是事實，那末馮先生的病至少是一椿可疑的事實。</p>
<p>假如馮先生本來無病而偏說有病，那便是［稱病］，［托病］，稱病與托病是中國官僚的傳統惡習慣，我們不希望馮先生也染了這惡習，［合則留，不合則</p>
<p>去］，這裹，不容諉托，不容假借，每一個政治家都應該有這種光明磊落的態度，稱病，托病，只是鬼鬼崇崇的勾當。我們老百姓所需要的官，是；</p>

<p>［楊柳岸曉風殘月］而我則得之於··　　一，西樓的窗間！那時我在學校裹的寢室是朝西的一個大房間，同寢室的人有十多個，而我的床則恰恰鋪在窗口，下半夜往往我自然的醒了，更自然不不再睡了，便坐起來呼吸着似風非風的凉氣，凝視着半規的皓魄，和數百步外城垣上的雉堞，彼此萬慮俱寂的相對着；　　二，關帝廟塲上！後來我因爲耽靜，在一個冬天，搬到了和學校相去三里的一座冷落的關帝廟中，每天總是東方還没有發白，便趕起來奔到校中去吃六點三刻的早餐，一路踏着雪一般的濃霜，連帶的想起了［床前明月光］，一抬首間，果然，在那杳冥冥的天邊，有一灣斜月和幾點疏星，向着清冷冷的朔風，閃燦個不停；</p>
<p>三，莫干山頭！有一個夏天，我在莫　山上住了兩星期下山這天，按着那時通行的習慣在天明之前，趕到一個同行的朋友地方去上轎，走過迴環曲折的磴道時，我的頭上一直灑落着紛紛不斷的明珠白玉，脚下蹴踏着鋪遍的白梅花，玉蘭片，我眞有些又驚又喜，哦，原來遍山的竹，密層層的細枝織葉，聽着曉來清風的好意，在將半身嫦俄的清輝篩下來呢；</p>
<p>四，亭子閒裹！於今我是只好在上海奔走衣食了，多謝大房東的美意，房子的方向是因地制宜的，低低的亭子問，我的宿舍，憑着晚上北極星的位置，却是朝西北的，因此我雖永遠看不見團園的明月，吹不到夏天的凉風，春天的和風，却時時在後弄人家的屋簷上看得見，假定被遮去一半的白玉盤，在窗間領略到一些夏熱冬冷的晨氣，我也就滿意了；</p>

<p>［多吃甜食必生蛀牙］本來是一句老古話，馴而爲社會上有勢力的一句衛生格言，就是普通一班醫生們，亦莫不信此爲天經地義常常勸告有子女的人，不許他們多吃甜食·然而據科學家的研究，則謂甜味之食物，富有滋養之力·小兒食，之極有裨益·發育時期，非此不可·那末究竟牙疾與甜食，有無相當的關係，勢非立刻加以解决不可·</p>
<p>在最近的數年來英國有一位女醫家，名呌梅萊培夫人·ＭｌｒｓＭｅｌｌａｎｂｙ曾爲這問題，作專門的研究·她對於骨科和牙科，本來是專門她的研究，當然是很可信的·據她最近發表的研究結果，則認定甜食與牙疾，並無直接的關係，小孩子們吃了糖菓，在某種情形之下，非但可以不生牙疾，且因甜食之富於滋養，實非多吃不可，</p>
<p>梅萊培夫人之說如此，天然不是空口說白話，她是有實地的試騐·最初她用小狗來試騐，日常用糖食飼犬，長成了後，非但不見牙患，且其身體骨骼竟較常狗爲佳·同時她又養了幾條小狗，一方面把糖果飼牠，一方面又把其日常食料中，除去了各笙的脂肪和青菜一類的東西，隔了許久，那幾條狗居然發現了牙患，因此。她認定牙疾之來，决不由於糖食之作崇，實因爲食料之中缺乏某種成分而已，這種成分，隨後又斷定爲［味太明Ａ，］</p>
<p>味太明Ａ］在脂肪中包含甚富，動物之肝，所含尤多：青菜蘿蔔一入人腹，即成此種成分·所以有牙疾的，假使多吃這幾種東西，就可以不治自愈·而小朋友們假使能多多吃點價廉物美的青菜蘿蔔，則雖一天到晚的嚼糖菓，也不致於嚼出牙病來·</p>
<p>梅萊培夫人發表了這項意見以來，頗引起全世界各國醫學界注意·英國有許多醫生，亦有以自已的子女爲實地的試騐·他們一方面留心用多量的味太明Ａ供給孩子們，一方面則讓他們去任意嚼食糖菓·據他們的報告，說試騐結果完滿，一班小孩子們竟没有一個患牙疾，我把此項新發見介紹給國人，也希望國内醫家大家起來試騐一下·</p>

<p>人的朋友Ａ，在一個做汽車夫的二房東家裹租了一間後客堂，在間斷後客堂與前客堂的板壁上，掛有一張［鍾旭</p>

<p>加一塊大洋］，終於加了一塊大洋，我的朋友才從二房東手裹買得一綫陽光。　　不久，我又同一位朋友在鄰近法國公園的一條衖堂裹，租了一間亭子間，經騐告訴我們··二房東要的租錢是較一般的特别貴，我們問他是什麽理由？他的答覆是··［這房子鄰近公園空氣很流通，［所以租錢要比較貴。］</p>
<p>兩個二房東的話活畫出了一個商品化了的上海，上海是有錢人的上海，上海一切都商品化，有錢人佔有了一切，窮人便連大自然普惠萬物的空氣和陽光，都没有自由領受的可能·</p>

<p>［牙籤是奢侈品，我們本國不製造，外國貨禁止輸入·］</p>
<p>此雖小節，然可想見蘇俄年來一方面固努力增加生產，一方面也努力節減浪費·大家同過着工人生活享用簡單·所以自政府要人起，都能潔已從公，這確是很大的原因·</p>

<p>▲陳化成戰死沙塲</p>
<p>當時兩江總督牛鑑駐師上海，江南提督陳化成駐防吳淞，牛鑑由滬抵吳淞，見英艦巍峨，高出海塘丈餘，噴烟蔽天，槍砲密佈十分驚慌，化成極力安慰他，說道；［外洋所</p>
<p>恃，不過槍砲，某經歷海洋五十年，此身在砲彈中入死出生者屢矣，今日火攻，頗有把握，願以身當之，苟得挫其鋒，援兵一鼓齊進，，英實不足平也］。八日黎明，化成首先麾令開砲擊沉英艦二艘。及英軍由東砲台登岸，守備韋印福等守西砲台，力戰而死。化成見軍無後援，撫膺頓足，潛然嘆日··［英夷頻年猩獗，今日得少挫其威，内江全局，關係匪輕不料埀成之功，敗於一旦，制使（謂牛鑑）殺我矣］。</p>
<p>衆兵皆逃，化成猶獨自開砲力戰，後因背腹受敵，遂中彈，噴血而死，化成爲福建人，當時他已是七十六歲的老頭兒了他的大無畏的精神，是值得後人崇拜的！並且聽說他的尸首，葬在城隍廟。</p>

<p>▲南京條約</p>
<p>英艦離滬上駛，砲擊鎭江，焚殺極慘，遂過擾揚州而攻南京，清庭遂命耆英伊里布牛鑑三人爲全權大臣，於道光二十二年七月二十四，日與英使璞鼎查締結中英修好條約，即所謂南京條約是也。</p>
<p>在南京條約之中，有一條是··［大</p>
<p>皇帝恩准英國人民帶回所屬家眷，寄居沿海之廣州，福州，廈門，寗波，上海等五處港口，貿易通商無碍］，從此上海的門戶洞開，新的命運開始了，不過我們研究這條約的原文，並没有允許外人在中國有租借土地的權利，也没有劃定居留地（即租界）的表示。</p>
<p>南京條約成立之後，美法兩國各派大使向清庭要求，允許得在上海等五口通商，與英人取得均等的待遇，清庭鑑於鴉片戰爭損失之大，遂慨然許之，道光二十四年五月十八日命兩廣總督耆英與美使柯身訂立中美通商條約。又於同年九月十三日，命欽差大臣耆英與法國全權公使孳拉克勒尼訂立中法修好條約。從此以後，上海成爲國際帝國主義的分割的商塲了。（未完）</p>

<p>伶聯會的大會串。向例是凡屬現在上海的會員。一律都要登台的。但演劇的時間有限。每齣戲裹所能容納的主角有限。而本會的各班會員。往往數近千人。以一千個演員。表演六七個鐘頭。十多齣戲劇。粥少僧多。支配上發生極大困難。於是想出八人或十人合演一個角色的救濟辦法。這種方法雖然熱閙可喜。然而各個演員的登塲時間太少。不能把自已的長處充份表現出來。未免美中不。足並且有許多不能分塲的戲。便請多數角兒同時登塲。如天女散花八個天女同時登塲合唱。漢津口裹跑出七八個關公來。究竟與事理不合。觀衆也看得眼花撩亂。判不出誰優誰劣所。以本會從上屆會戲起。就更變辦法了。與其兼收並蓄。不如删蕪存菁。專請幾位向無機會同台的好角兒。聯合在一起。每個角色皆由一個演員扮演到底。而尤其注重在劇本的精選。這樣纔能充分表現角兒們的藝術。觀衆纔能有眞的好戲可看。因爲伶聯會的大會串。目的固在籌欵。同時還負着宣傳伶界藝術的使命。决不是敎諸君破了鈔看一塲空熱閙就算了。祇少要請大帶一點藝術的印象回去。覺得這幾齣好戲。除了伶聯會的大會串以外。在别處是無論如何都看不到的。</p>
<p>本屆伶聯會的大會串。就是秉着這種精神來做的。諸君再要遇着這種盛會。祇少也要在一年以後因爲伶聯會自已主動的大會串。如無特别情形。每年祇多舉行。一次外界相煩的伶界會串。我們也不會下全體會員的動員令。</p>
<p>因爲上述的原因。所以我們此次大會串的戲目。只有兩齣。一齣是全本哭祖廟。一齣是全本琵琶詞。</p>
<h3 id="c197">名人名劇兩相輝 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>哭祖廟本是極難唱的戲。自從汪伶隠去世以後。雖然也有人表演過。但是能夠博到美譽的却不多見。因爲此戲主角北樓王劉諶。首場與劉阿斗力爭［降敵不如戰死］二場見崔夫人。殺家殉國。情節十分緊張。演來已很費力。而連下來就要演哭廟。中間休息的時間極少。哭廟之大段唱工。有七節之多。前後一百多句。比唱碰碑還要吃力。如果功夫稍微不到家。難免就要聲嘶力竭。所以學伶隠一派鬚生的人。對於此劇皆視爲畏途。</p>
<p>杜夫人爲海上名媛而天賦獨厚。學力尤深。休說尋常票友望塵莫及。就是伶界名宿對之。亦多自歎勿如。夫人對於哭祖廟一劇。尤下過一番深切的研究工夫。故能舉重若輕。措置裕如。伶界會串已至二十二次了。以前從未借重過任何外串。而此次獨敦請杜夫人加入幫忙。這就是杜夫人的藝術。能敎本會全體會員折服的明證。</p>
<p>杜夫人絕不肯輕現。色相此次實緣事關公益。經本會再三敦請。始蒙俯允。非特本會不勝感謝。就是顧曲諸君的耳福也自不小呢。本會爲錦上添花起見。特選著名藝員爲充配角。要將這本哭祖廟演成中國空前的好戲。</p>
<p>與杜夫人直接配戲的要角是崔夫人。特煩善演悲劇的坤旦李慧琴女士扮演她們爲了殺家一場。已排演過無數次。搭配得熟極而流。預料這場戲。定能賺人不少眼涙。請諸君多帶一塊手帕來看戲吧。</p>
<p>中國第一位口吃將軍鄧艾。他是雄猜陰很。貪得無饜的野心國主將地位至爲重要。由周信芳君担任表演。諸葛瞻父子在國勢萬分危急之際。不避艱險。統率蜀兵。誓死抗敵。這種救國精神。堪爲後世軍人模範。今由林樹森高雪樵二君分飾之。一個忠心耿耿一個勇氣糾糾。看了可以廉頑立懦。</p>
<p>其餘如陳鶴峯君的張翼。董志揚君的鄧忠。劉坤榮君的馬邈。韓金奎君的黄皓。趙東昇君的鍾會。陳嘉璘君的劉禪。劉文美君的李夫人。都是在各班裹精選出來。適合各人個性的角兒。演來都能恰到好處。</p>

<p>本會爲調和觀衆情緒起見。在國事戲哭祖廟之外。又排了一本社會好戲［全本琵琶詞］這齣戲的名字。何等香艷典雅。一望而知是悲歡離合。極能感動人心的好戲。小楊月樓君飾女主角秦香蓮。是一個被棄的薄命女子。演來哀艷絕倫。敎人傷心。趙如泉君飾男主角王延齡。是一個仗義執言的君子。寓莊於諧。令人絶倒。此外還有一位要角陳世美。由張桂芬君扮演。他扮的是負心漢子。唱做並重。精采極多。合三個劇塲的好角兒於一台。分飾劇中主角。這纔是眞嶄實貨的珠聯璧合好戲咧。</p>

Niu disembarked, and Binke arrived in Tianjin at 3:00 PM, reporting to the Railway Bureau. He stated that the journey from Huanggu Tun to Tianjin took a total of three days and two nights. Many Japanese military trains were stationed in Jinzhou. Railway spikes outside the Guan were mostly removed by Japanese soldiers, making train travel very dangerous. The reopening of this railway is not expected anytime soon, as this company is shirking responsibility to the puppet Northeast Communications Committee, and the puppet Communications Committee is pushing responsibility back to this company.

<p>(Harbin) On the evening of the 8th, a battle occurred in Yushu County. By the morning of the 9th, it had subsided slightly. The conflicting sides were the Jilin troops of Xi Qia and the 25th Brigade of Zhang Zuoxiang's troops under Zhang Zuozhou. On the evening of the 9th, the 163rd Regiment of Xing Zhanqing's 26th Brigade of the Jilin troops stationed in Harbin, set out to Yushu to reinforce the 25th Brigade. The commander on Xi Qia's side was the puppet Bandit Suppression Commander Yu Shenzheng, leading the Jingbei First Brigade under Liu Kuanlin, and over 6,000 newly recruited bandits under Gong Daizi. On the 6th, under the false pretense of bandit suppression, they circled from Shushu County to Yushu, planning to eliminate the 25th Brigade first, and then drive out the Jilin Provisional Provincial Government. At 8:00 PM on the evening of the 8th, 35 li from Yushu County, they were fiercely attacked by Zhang Zuozhou's troops in conjunction with the local militia, resulting in a night-long battle. At 2:00 AM on the morning of the 9th, Yu's troops were unable to withstand the attack and fled in defeat towards Shushu.

<h3 id="e7">Japan's Reply to the American Note <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Will Be Issued Soon</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to sources from the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Japan did not request a response to the American memorandum on the Manchurian issue, so there is no need to reply. However, Japan is willing to follow diplomatic practice and send a reply to the US Secretary of State, Mr. Stimson. The content will roughly reiterate that the actions of the Japanese army in Manchuria do not violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which prohibits war and stipulates arbitration. Furthermore, as Japan is a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty, it will also declare Japan's respect for the territorial and administrative integrity of China. Personnel from the Japanese Foreign Ministry also stated that Japan will declare in its reply to the American memorandum that Japan does not hinder China's Open Door Policy, nor does it wish to damage the rights and interests of other countries in China. At the same time, Washington should be aware of the rights that Japan should enjoy in China. As for the situation in Jinzhou mentioned by Mr. Stimson, Japan's memorandum will state that the Japanese army's current bandit suppression strategy within Manchuria is being implemented in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations Council on December 10th of last year. Japan does not advocate eliminating China's governance rights in Jinzhou, but only wishes for the Chinese army to retreat to within the Pass in order to avoid the possibility of conflict between the Chinese and Japanese armies. According to Japanese Foreign Ministry personnel, Japan's reply has been fully drafted and is expected to be delivered to Washington on Tuesday or Wednesday. (10th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Criticism from the British *Observer* Newspaper</p>
<p>(London) An editorial in this morning's *Observer* newspaper stated that the American note to Japan, while very important, is not alarming. This note creates a new principle: that the United States cannot recognize the expansion of territory by a country that disregards other countries and relies on arbitrary force. Japan claims that it acted involuntarily to uphold its treaty rights and that the Japanese army did not attack China, but only drove out a warlord who has no representative rights and no hereditary right to rule Manchuria and who is hostile to Japan. Therefore, there must be a new Chinese administration in Manchuria, with no more than 60,000 troops stationed in the territory, and Japan's demands must be newly recognized and defined with international consent.

<p>(Beiping) Gu Weijun commented today on the American note to China and Japan, stating that this document clearly intends to define the United States' attitude towards the Manchurian Incident since September. I hope that its effect will be to halt Japan's policy of aggression, which violates various treaty obligations. The United States is the guarantor of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the initiator of the Open Door Policy and the policy of maintaining China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity. This action is in line with the demeanor of statesmen. The Japanese army's warlike activities have now spread throughout Manchuria, rendering all peaceful instruments and assistance false and shrouding the international community in gloom. The American note now reveals a glimmer of light, namely, that solemnly agreed international treaties aimed at eliminating war and maintaining peace can be expected to take effect internationally. Those who deliberately violate them cannot be forgiven. The United States' action is motivated by a sincere spirit of amity and consultation, and I believe that it can have a positive impact.

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Ji said: 1) My greatest goal in participating in the peace conference is to seek unity and work together to face foreign aggression. I still hold this goal and will do my best. I will go to Shanghai, Fenghua, and Hong Kong in the coming days to urge Mr. Wang, Mr. Hu, and Mr. Chiang to come to Nanjing as soon as possible and shoulder the important responsibilities of the nation. Nanjing and Shanghai are very close, and if Mr. Wang's illness improves slightly, I will ask him to come to Nanjing in advance. 2) My talent and ability are insufficient for the position of President of the Legislative Yuan, but in this time of national crisis, I must勉任艱鉅 (reluctantly take on the arduous task). The date of taking office has not yet been decided and will be held after I return to Nanjing from Shanghai, Fenghua, and Hong Kong. 3) After the Japanese occupied Jinzhou, they are also threatening to invade Rehe. Our army has made considerable preparations. The report that the Beiping Political Branch has been organized is an error for the Political Affairs Committee. Only a few discussion meetings have been held, and it has not been officially established. Zhang Xueliang advocates that the committee adopt a committee system and not have a chairman, but rather that the majority of members be responsible as the standard. It will be officially organized after the central government's instructions arrive in Beiping. The establishment of the Military Affairs Commission is also to effectively reorganize military affairs. I have not heard in Beiping that Zhang Xueliang intends to resign. Mr. Li Shizeng is currently in Beiping and will come to Nanjing in the shortest possible time. 4) I previously went to Hebian Village to meet with Yan Xishan, who was extremely saddened by the Japanese army's invasion of the three northeastern provinces. He hopes that the whole country can unite and work together to resist foreign aggression. If there is an opportunity, he will do his duty as a citizen and help. He is currently planning to develop the Northwest and run industries, which will be realized soon. The report that Shanxi has formed a Political Branch is also an error for the Political Affairs Committee. 5) The United States' communication to the Nine-Power Treaty countries condemning Japan's occupation of the three northeastern provinces is a demonstration of international justice. Japan's aggressive actions are seriously endangering world peace. In my personal observation, Japan's annexation of Korea has already shaken the foundations of peace in East Asia. Now, its forcible occupation of our three northeastern provinces is nothing less than laying the fuse for a global war. The prospects for peace are becoming increasingly dangerous.

If the laws and regulations are not perfect, they must be legally amended before their organization can be changed. 2) The organization of people's groups should be initiated by the people themselves. The party headquarters should only stand in a position of promoting and guiding. 3) The constituent members of vocational groups should be limited to those currently working in various professions. It is absolutely forbidden for those not in the profession to participate. 4) The system of people's groups, unless otherwise stipulated by law, should be specified separately according to its nature, and should not be bound by vertical or horizontal terminology. 5) The selection of personnel to guide the people's movement should be based absolutely on talent as the standard. 6) The guiding method should gradually move towards rule of law, and absolutely avoid illegal interference. 7) The ultimate goal of guidance is to complete local self-government in accordance with the Outline of National Reconstruction, and to enhance the welfare of each individual people's group. 8) Personnel responsible for guidance must pay attention to the investigation and statistics of the people's movement, and eliminate the infringement of all corrupt and evil forces. 9) Guide party members to participate in the organization of people's groups in relation to their respective industries.

<p>(Beiping) Qiu Zengyi talked about how the Shanxi currency has fallen so badly that one yuan of Shanxi currency is not worth even one jiao. The relief plan proposed by the Finance Department is still to maintain the 24 million financial public bonds. The bond certificates printed by the Ministry of Finance have not been issued, so the original plan to issue bond certificates to redeem Shanxi currency on New Year's Day has failed, and the money merchants are manipulating the situation even more severely. This trip to Beiping is to ask Chairman Xu Yong for instructions on important matters and to participate in the Financial Reorganization Committee. Yesterday, he visited Zhang Xueliang. He is not aware of rumors of reorganization of the Shanxi provincial government. Shanxi's finances are short of 600,000 yuan per month due to high military expenditures.

<h3 id="e38">Grave National Crisis Requires National Awakening <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>There is a common saying: "A nation without external enemies will perish." The disaster in the Northeast has erupted, and three months have already passed. In a short time, half of our land has fallen, and the enemy's iron cavalry is roaring and advancing westward. This blow cannot be said to be anything other than a fatal wound to our nation. Logically speaking, this blow should also be enough to awaken our nation, which has been in chaotic infighting for the past twenty years, to wash its heart and renew its life, and to jointly seek a way to survive. However, in reality, those who plunder still plunder, and those who quarrel still quarrel. In the past three months, the external crisis has become more urgent, and the state affairs have become more chaotic. It is as if there is no country and no government. We fear the destruction of the country every day, but we are rushing headlong towards the road of national subjugation. When the disaster first broke out, politicians declared to the people: "The external crisis is due to internal chaos. We must reorganize the government, and we must clarify politics." Therefore, those who spoke and those who acted all took this as their goal. In the end, the political situation took a sharp turn for the worse due to the pressure of the times. The old ones left in anger, and the new ones came in joy. But what happened when they came? They said it was for the country, but the country's difficulties remained the same. They said it was for the people, but the people's suffering remained the same. So what was it really for? Perhaps it was to play the childish game of advancing and rising in officialdom. There was no solution to internal affairs, and no solution to diplomacy. Those who needed to recuperate were recuperating, and those who were leisurely were leisurely. They talked about unity, but they moved in opposite directions. Disputes increased daily. They talked about peace, but mutual suspicion became more evident. The new government had been established, but there was no focus in politics, and the government had no responsibility. Everything was scattered and chaotic, even worse than before. So what was new about the new government? It was exactly what Mr. So-and-so said: "You are no good; overthrow you; I will do it." The soup was changed, but the medicine was still the same. Human desires were rampant, and the national crisis was not taken into consideration. Yet, they still declared to the people: "This is a renewal; this is a revolution." Who are they deceiving? Are they deceiving Heaven? This is one way to national subjugation.</p>
<p>Speaking of the military, China's army seems to be specifically for promoting internal strife. Their courage in killing each other, tooth for tooth and eye for eye, even astonished Europeans who had participated in the European War. However, when an external enemy arrived, they retreated at the mere sight of them, allowing the enemy to drive straight in. The loss of Shenyang could still be said to have been due to a sudden uprising, with no prior preparation. But what about Jinzhou now? They retreated with their entire army, leaving the volunteer army, without commanders, supplies, or bullets, and the so-called "bandits" like Little White Dragon, to fight the enemy in bloody battles. Now, even the troops on the Luan River have been completely withdrawn, and the enemy is once again marching towards Rehe with cavalry. The Northeast has already telegraphed, declaring that it will not be sacrificed for political purposes. The troops in the provinces within the Shanhaiguan Pass are also allowing the enemy's cavalry to roar and rampage, and allowing the territory to be nibbled away day by day, as if they were Yue people looking at the fatness or thinness of the Qin people, indifferent and without joy or sorrow. Moreover, new antagonisms are brewing and becoming increasingly mature. The so-called Southwest Political Committee, the so-called Beiping Political Branch, and all other acts of intrigue and infighting clearly announce to the people that a new situation of division has been formed. The bombardment of cannons cannot break the power dreams of ambitious military men and politicians. Holding troops is all for plundering, all for harming the country, and all for afflicting the people. Twenty years have passed as if it were a single day. The national pulse and the people's lives are all held in the hands of these people. This is yet another way to national subjugation.</p>
<p>Speaking of diplomacy, for the past five years, they have been chanting about revolutionary diplomacy. The term is certainly new, novel, and appealing. However, it is nothing more than novel and appealing. As for the actual reality, it cannot be said, and we cannot bear to say it. When the new government was established, the new diplomatic authorities said that they would break through the national crisis by using diplomatic means. But what were the means? The people craned their necks in anticipation. Jinzhou fell again, and Rehe was once again in urgent need of help. The means remained unheard of and unseen. If they did exist, they would be nothing more than the consistent diplomatic policy of using barbarians to control barbarians and rejecting the tiger at the front door while welcoming the wolf at the back door. This is yet another way to national subjugation.</p>
<p>Internal affairs are like this, and diplomacy is like this. The devastating floods cannot be relieved. The external crisis is becoming more urgent, and there is no way to deal with it. If the country does not face danger, how can it be safe? If it does not perish, how can it survive?</p>
<p>Are our people willing to sit idly by and watch the demise of the country and the destruction of the race? If we are not willing, then we must rise up and save ourselves. Now is the time. What is the way to save ourselves? It is to supervise and urge the government to act on the public will of the people and actively start defending against foreign aggression, relieving disasters, and recovering lost territories. If it cannot do so, then the government is exposing its incompetence and its inability to bear the heavy responsibility of dealing with the national crisis. The people should then find new ways to struggle and must not sit and wait for death, or crane their necks and wait to be slaughtered. Since the government does not want to shoulder the heavy responsibility of resisting tyranny and saving the country, our people will never be the people of a fallen nation. People of the country, rise up quickly and find a new way to struggle. If you only make meaningless appeals and expectations, China will never see the dawn.</p>

<h3 id="e73">German Chancellor Declares Inability to Bear Reparations <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Causes Shock in Paris</p>
<p>French Finance Minister Flandin Publishes Article Claiming Sacred Contracts Cannot Be Broken</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 9th: German Chancellor Brüning told the British ambassador yesterday that Germany would demand the cancellation of reparations at the reparations conference. Today, he issued another article stating that it is impossible for Germany to continue paying political reparations. He believes that no one today is unaware of the inevitable consequences. Now, we must muster courage and not allow economic problems to be subject to political considerations. The Basel Conference report has shown the tragic consequences of the war suffered by Germany and acknowledged the extreme measures taken by Germany to resist its difficulties, which are unprecedented in modern history. This report also shows that Germany's plan alone is of no avail. World financial difficulties are increasing, and the reasons for this are mostly Germany's position. Therefore, Germany must earnestly request that all governments immediately take joint action. Brüning also said that Germany's inability to pay its debts, the close relationship between German reparations and the world situation, and the circumstances under which the Young Plan was established have now undergone a thorough change, as proven by the Basel Conference report. The continuation of German political reparations is impossible for Germany's situation. If there is a scheme to maintain this reparation, it will inevitably cause a dramatic disaster not only for Germany but also for the entire world. Germany agreed to the proposal put forward by France and supported by Britain to hold the Lausanne Reparations Conference on January 25. The German government has no other choice in the attitude and events it can adopt. There is no other way but to state the truth at the conference and ask other governments concerned to consider the current situation and not try to mediate, because this possibility no longer exists.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 9th: Brüning's remarks have caused shock in Paris. Members of the parliament today unanimously recognized the seriousness of this development. Most people say that Germany is determined to deny its obligations under the Young Plan, making the Lausanne Reparations Conference a useless move. The creditor nations should immediately consult on a common attitude. The Young Plan stipulates that if Germany defaults, it can appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. People in political circles all say that in the German Chancellor's move, they can see the hand of Hitler, the leader of the National Socialist Party. Finance Minister Flandin published an article, saying that if Brüning's remarks are true as reported, it means that the German government wants to cancel the Young Plan and the Treaty of Versailles. The French people will never allow it to be unilaterally cancelled and destroy France's sacred right to reparations. No one denies the severity of the world's panic and the need to revise the government's payment methods in order to overcome the difficulties. The French government is currently working on this matter and is studying a plan that creditors and debtors can agree on with a very moderate spirit to alleviate the difficulties. But if a new attack is launched on the contract, causing the difficulties to become more entangled, it will only make this difficulty insurmountable. The only result of this move is to make it even more impossible for people to invest.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 9th: Yesterday, Brüning told the British ambassador that Germany was unable to pay reparations again. Therefore, the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin immediately denied the foreign reports that Mr. Bai had spoken to the British ambassador. However, those who are well-informed believe that what the German Foreign Ministry denied was only the wording of the British record of the conversation. As for the fact that Mr. Bai had asked the British ambassador to pay attention to Germany's inability to raise funds to pay reparations, it is undoubtedly true. Not long after, Mr. Bai did have a conversation with the press.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 9th: According to political circles, Brüning did not declare to the British ambassador that Germany would no longer pay compensation, as foreign newspapers reported. Mr. Bai met with the British ambassador for a long time and only said that, according to Germany's situation, it is really impossible to pay compensation at this time, and it is feared that there will be no power to pay in the future. According to the opinion of German people, Brüning's declaration is not as absolute as foreign telegrams reported, and it is said that the German government will decide its attitude on this matter within the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th: The New York banking community was not alarmed today by the German Chancellor's declaration that Germany could no longer pay reparations. A prominent banker said that the original intention of this declaration was to feign hope in order to facilitate negotiations. He expects that a payment method can always be agreed upon in the future. Even if the Allied powers refuse to pay their war debts to the United States, it will not cause great distress to the United States, because once the debt problem is resolved, trade can be quickly revived, and what the United States can gain in prosperous trade will be many times the amount of the debt.</p>

<p>Electric Communication, Tokyo, 10th: The Nakano Seigō faction, which broke away from the Minseito Party, must establish a clear banner to cope with this critical moment in preparation for the general election after the dissolution of the parliament.

The Republicans plan to nominate Hoover as their candidate, and there are currently no competitors.

<p>Shanhaiguan Correspondence: The Japanese army stationed in Shanhaiguan is a part of the garrison permitted by the Boxer Protocol along the Beijing-Fengtian Railway. The force consists of two companies, approximately 230 infantry soldiers, plus wartime machine gun squads, communications teams, etc., seemingly possessing independent combat capabilities. Their barracks are located south of the railway, surrounded by permanent fortifications. The outer moat is several fathoms wide, and between the outer moat and the central fortress, there are multiple lines of trenches, totaling eight layers. The trenches are covered, preventing penetration by bullets and fragmentation from artillery shells. The communication trenches, traps, electric fences, etc., are all constructed using the latest post-World War methods. In the central location, there are also five cannons, sufficient to withstand attacks from the enemy for several days. Inside, there is a radio station capable of communicating with Japan. The facility is equipped to utilize solid fortifications to resist fiercely in case of attack, while simultaneously sending telegrams to request assistance, awaiting reinforcements. Since the withdrawal of our army from Jinzhou, the Japanese army stationed in Shanhaiguan has been preparing for action day and night. The garrison commander issued a note to He Zhuguo, commander of our Ninth Brigade, stating that if a single shot is fired within the area from Shanhaiguan to Qinhuangdao, a major incident would be unavoidable. Simultaneously, eleven Japanese warships arrived off the coast of Shanhaiguan. The fleet commander, Tsuda Shizue, also sent a note to Commander He, stating that the Japanese side would not prevent the withdrawal of the Chinese army from Jinzhou, but they would not be permitted to stop between Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao. If gunfire is detected within this area, the Japanese warships will take appropriate measures, etc. After receiving this note, Commander He knew that the Japanese army intended to provoke a conflict, so he ordered the troop trains to temporarily halt at Wantun (the first station outside Shanhaiguan). Commander He then dispatched locomotives to tow the trains through the pass at high speed, past Qinhuangdao, to Beidaihe, where they were transferred to other locomotives and sent to their destinations. When the troop trains passed through Yuguan, the Japanese army applauded and jeered on the platform. The general populace closed their doors and dared not watch. It took four days to transport all the Northeast Army into the pass. The Japanese army stationed in Yuguan, as the troop trains did not linger, had no opportunity to provoke a conflict, but it was still a close call. (January 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Provocation by the Japanese Consul and Naval Captain in Fuzhou <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>▲Assassination Occurs Inside the Japanese Club</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: On the afternoon of January 2nd, the Anti-Japanese Associations of various schools in the provincial capital held an anti-Japanese art propaganda event at West Lake Park. Many people watched. The Japanese Consul, accompanied by the captain of the Kitakami, a warship anchored at the Mawei Naval Academy, also entered the park by car to watch. They actually tore down the posters on the wall and seized and tore up leaflets distributed by the students. Their attitude was extremely barbaric, causing a great uproar among the people. The Consul and Captain, realizing that the situation was unfavorable, hurriedly tried to flee the park. Unexpectedly, when they reached the bridge near the park entrance, the captain fell on the stone steps, injuring his forehead and bleeding slightly. He immediately drew his pistol and fired at the crowd. Fortunately, the soldiers and police maintaining order in the park arrived and stopped him, taking him to the city's Public Security Bureau, and in the evening, he was taken back to the consulate by car. The people were extremely indignant that the dignified Consul and Captain dared to provoke and commit violence in the park, and petitioned the provincial government, requesting that they telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese Ambassador. Unexpectedly, the next day, the Japanese Consul instead made three demands to the provincial government: punish the perpetrators, apologize, and ban the anti-Japanese movement. How this will be resolved in the future remains to be seen.</p>
<p>On the night of the 3rd, at 8:30 PM, in the Japanese club at Taigu Ping, Cangqian Mountain, the Japanese elementary school teacher, Mito San'yu, and his wife were suddenly assassinated. Mito was stabbed in the lower jaw, and his wife was stabbed in the neck. According to Mito's dying words, there were three murderers, but he did not mention their nationality before he died. It is investigated that the place is a gathering place for Japanese people, with tight security, and Chinese people rarely go there, let alone at night, it is even more difficult for Chinese people to enter the house. According to the investigation, the assassination was carried out by Taiwanese people who had a private feud with Mito. After receiving the report, the provincial government immediately sent Commissioner Chen Peikun to the consulate to inquire and to inspect the scene of the incident. On the morning of the 4th, the local court sent a prosecutor to examine the body, but was refused by the Japanese side. The funeral pyre was held that afternoon. The provincial government also convened an emergency meeting at 5 PM that afternoon, deciding that: 1) Regarding the assassination of Mito and his wife, regardless of the identity of the murderer, the provincial government should thoroughly investigate the matter. In addition to offering a reward of 10,000 yuan for the arrest of the murderer, the military and police are required to solve the case within 36 hours. 2) All anti-Japanese organizations from all walks of life will immediately cease operations. Elementary and middle schools in the provincial capital will start their winter vacation early from the 5th. 3) Martial law will be tightened. The 56th Division will dispatch a battalion, in coordination with the marine battalion originally stationed in Qiaonan, to guard the Cangqian Mountain and Fanchuanpu areas. Traffic will be stopped at 10 PM at night, and theaters will stop performing in the evening. Therefore, Fuzhou suddenly became tense again from the 5th.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: On the evening of the 3rd of this month, at 8:30 PM, in the dormitory of the Japanese elementary school attached to the Japanese club at Taigu Ping, Cangqian Mountain, the teacher Mito San'yu and his wife were assassinated. Mito was 30 years old, his wife 24, and they had been married for a year. Mito was stabbed in the lower jaw, and his wife suffered multiple injuries to the neck and lower abdomen. His wife died immediately, and Mito died on the way to the Fuzhou Boai Hospital. How the murderers came is still unclear. However, according to Japanese sources, Mito told someone before he died that three people broke into the house to commit the crime, one escaped from the front door and two from the back door, etc., but he did not mention why he was killed or the nationality of the murderers. That department is in Taigu Ping, where Chinese people rarely set foot, and even less so during the period of martial law. When asked, the doorman of the department did not know how the murderers came. There were also no differences on the door of the deceased's dormitory. Upon hearing the news, the provincial government immediately ordered the military and police agencies to strictly arrest the suspects, setting a deadline of 36 hours from 8 PM on the 4th to arrest the murderers, and offered a reward of 10,000 yuan in order to solve the case as soon as possible. Liu Shangzhi, the temporary martial law commander of Fuzhou, Li Dingzhang, the deputy commander, and Guo Yongyun, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, all expressed their resignation for the occurrence of this case, but it is unknown whether it will be approved. After this incident occurred, the Japanese warship Enoshima transported over a hundred sailors to Taijiang, who landed and went to the Japanese Consulate. More than fifty of them were stationed at the Dongying School and Fuxin Street Boai Hospital in Cangxia Zhou, and it was rumored that four Japanese warships were sailing from Sasebo to cause trouble under pretext. However, this case occurred in a remote place at night, and inside the house, which the military and police could not prevent. Our side does not bear any responsibility. (January 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Riot of White Russians in Harbin <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>▲The Cause is the Heshengli Theft Case</p>
<p>▲More Than Ten Thousand People Gathered to Block Traffic</p>
<p>▲Injured Police and Seized Firearms</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The White Russians residing in Harbin, their psychology of despising the Chinese people, has not diminished since the fall of the three northeastern provinces under the policy of non-resistance, since the demise of Imperial Russia. After the three Northeastern provinces fell, the White Russians saw the status of the Chinese people as even lower than slaves of a conquered nation. Incidents of assault and resistance to arrest have occurred in the city, and every time after being arrested, they impersonate Japanese citizens in hopes of being released by chance. The authorities are muddled and have no good way to deal with it, which further emboldens the White Russians. On the 2nd of this month, a major riot of White Russians occurred. The cause of this incident was that the Heshengli Cigarette, Wine, and Sundries Store, located at the corner of Central Street and Bread Street in Daoli District, was run by Li Yankui as the manager, with more than ten shop assistants. Their livelihood was not bad. On the 31st of last month, a White Russian named Jin Duoweichi, along with five men and women, went to the store, falsely claiming to be shopping and selecting items separately. After a long time, they rarely found anything that satisfied them. The manager Li Yankui found it quite strange, and carefully examined Jin Duoweichi's face, realizing that the man had come to shop many times, and every time after he left, the store would lose goods. Therefore, he paid attention to him. Sure enough, he saw the White Russian taking advantage of people's inattention to steal two Western shirts and a bag of candy, hiding them under his clothes. At the same time, one of the girls accompanying him also stole a box of sweets and stuffed it into her pocket. Li Yankui, having discovered the stolen goods, grabbed the two of them and refused to let go. The other Russians accompanying them actually beat Li viciously, injuring his head and face, and tearing his clothes. Jin Duoweichi even shouted that the Chinese were falsely accusing his daughter of stealing, and the Russians should rise up to defend her. As a result, many Russians passing by outside the door gathered, wanting to enter and join the beating. Just then, the nearby police arrived, pushed their way into the crowd, ordered the store to close the front door, and took the ringleader Jin Duoweichi away from the back door. After arriving at the police station, Jin Duoweichi presented a Lithuanian citizenship certificate, denying that he was a White Russian, and claiming that he had become a Japanese citizen, not acknowledging theft. As the case was minor, he was released. Unexpectedly, at around 5 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, a Russian woman, along with more than ten Russian thugs, came to Heshengli, claiming that Jin Duoweichi was her husband, and that he had been beaten and injured by the store for being falsely accused of theft, and had died in the hospital. They demanded that the store's personnel pay for his life. At that time, they directed the thugs to smash the goods in the store and dragged out the store manager Li Yankui, beating him severely on the spot. Li was seriously injured. Upon hearing the news, the Shangwu Street Police Station of the First Precinct urgently dispatched several police officers to mediate. The thugs resisted relying on their numbers. Subsequently, the First Precinct, upon hearing the news, dispatched a large team of police to disperse the crowd and rescue Li. By then, he was covered in injuries and barely breathing. He was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. At this time, the police planned to arrest the leaders of the thugs. The thugs relied on their numbers and clamored, resisting arrest, and seizing the pistol of policeman Zhao Yongbin, pressing Zhao to the ground and beating him. Another thug climbed up and gave a speech, saying that it was the most shameful thing for a Russian to be beaten by the Chinese, the slaves of a conquered nation. The Chinese police should hand over the manager of Heshengli and send him to the Japanese consulate to be dealt with. At that time, many White Russians were listening, and they all agreed. Immediately, more than 10,000 people gathered. The road on Central Street, several miles long, was crowded with people, and traffic was blocked. Police officers on duty in various street sections could not perform their duties. Later, after the First Precinct dispatched more police officers to assist in maintaining traffic, they fired a row of shots into the air as a warning. However, the thugs not only did not disperse, but instead surrounded the police, and used wooden poles to raise the seized police hats, displaying them to the thoroughfare, mocking and laughing at each other. After 8 PM, the thugs dragged tables and chairs from the shops along the road to the center of the road, and piled them up across the street at the intersection of Bread Street and Central Street, blocking traffic. All vehicles, horses, and pedestrians were blocked. The street was originally a bustling street in Daoli District and a vital artery for the city's transportation, and at that time, it was completely blocked. Seeing that the situation was dangerous, the Heshengli store had already boarded up the doors and turned off the lights. At 8:30 PM, the thugs used axes and hammers to smash the store's signboard. At 8:40 PM, the Special Police Administration sent a fire truck to disperse the thugs with water hoses, but because there were too many people, it did not work and left. Later, the armed security team was also dispatched, but retreated due to the strength of the thugs. After 9 PM, the thugs' speeches became more intense. Some advocated immediately forming a volunteer army and asking the Japanese Consul to issue firearms. Some shouted that from today onwards, the Russians would occupy Central Street. Various strange slogans were endless. A member of the Japanese Consulate, at around 10 PM, passed through the blocked traffic in a car. White Russians rushed to clear the way, shouting "Long live the Japanese Empire." The Japanese Consulate member also deliberately showed the power of his imperialism, passing through the area four times. After 12 PM, there were no Chinese people on the streets. Russian thugs were still shouting in the thoroughfare, dismantling tables and chairs, holding wooden weapons, looking for Chinese people to beat. It was not until 4 AM on the 3rd, when the cold wind was piercing, that most of them could not stand it and gradually dispersed. Some thugs still used iron tools to smash Heshengli as they left. Because the doors and windows were made of iron, they were unable to do so, and then dispersed. On the way, they encountered police officers on duty, and chased after them, knocking out the police officers on duty in front of the China Bank branch and on 12th Street, and seizing their pistols. It was not until around 5 AM that it became quiet. (Morning of the 3rd) Continued letter on the 4th: Regarding the case of the Russian thugs gathering and rioting, yesterday, Wang Ruihua, the director of the Special Police Administration, went to see Zhang Jinghui late at night to ask for instructions. Zhang ordered that if the Russian thugs deliberately provoke trouble, they should maintain order within their authority. This morning (the 4th), Wang had ordered the security teams of various district offices to be on high alert. On the one hand, in order to appease the Russian thugs, the Heshengli grocery store where the incident occurred was sealed, and a notice was issued in Chinese and Russian, stating that they would send personnel to investigate the matter in order to handle the incident fairly. After the notice was issued, many Chinese and foreigners gathered to watch. In order to maintain order, the police dispatched a large team of armed police officers to patrol the streets to prevent the thugs from gathering again. Unexpectedly, at around 11 AM, the Russian thugs gradually gathered again in front of Heshengli. By 11:30 AM, there were already over a thousand people gathered. A thug said that the Chinese police authorities had already succumbed, but unless they took thorough measures, they would have to demand that the Heshengli personnel be handed over and sent to the Japanese Consulate for investigation. The crowd echoed him. At 12:10 PM, the thugs continued their work of blocking traffic by piling up tables, chairs, bricks, and stones in the center of the road. There were many vehicles, horses, and pedestrians coming and going that were intercepted at both ends. The police authorities could no longer tolerate this and dispatched two teams of armed security guards to set up checkpoints at the intersections of Central Street, first blocking pedestrians, and then sending personnel to persuade the thugs to remove the obstacles and disperse. The thugs did not listen and resisted with weapons. Therefore, the police fired several rows of shots, first firing into the air. The thugs stood still. Finally, they fired downward, injuring four people on the spot. The thugs then became fearful and wanted to escape. The police continued to fire, dispersing the thugs until they disappeared from Central Street. Only then did they stop shooting. Fearing that the thugs would gather again, they immediately set up posts along Central Street, prohibiting pedestrians and vehicles. From 12:40 PM in the afternoon until the morning of the 4th, the posts had not been removed. The security was strict at night. In addition to Central Street, the other streets were also filled with police officers on duty. Zhang Jinghui's temporary guard team was also dispatched to assist in patrolling and guarding throughout the night. The sound of gunfire was intermittent. At around 10 PM in the evening, the thugs gathered on Diagonal Street, intending to attack the police again. A Russian threw a hand grenade at the police, injuring a member of the guard team. They were dispersed by gunfire. That night, whenever three or four Russians gathered in any street, the police fired shots to disperse them. Fortunately, there were no incidents overnight. The shops on Central Street closed their doors and stopped business at noon on the 3rd when they heard the sound of gunfire. They gradually reopened this afternoon. When the Russian thugs were dispersed by the police, they carried their injured companions to the Japanese Consulate in Nangang to petition, demanding that the Japanese Consul protest to us, punish the police authorities, and arrest the Heshengli personnel. The Japanese Consul invited the representatives of the thugs inside and comforted them for a long time before the crowd dispersed. The situation in the city today is slightly calmer, but the police's precautions are still very tense. It is rumored that there is a Japanese background to this incident, as the Japanese side wants to advance into Harbin but is afraid of Soviet obstruction, so they incited the White Russians to create a pretext. Therefore, the authorities are not daring to slacken their precautions. Last night, Zhang Jinghui and the Special Police Administration issued the following notices: ▲Zhang Jinghui's Notice: Regarding the fact that the old Russian people residing in Harbin enjoy various treatments in China, which can be said to be unparalleled in the world. These expatriates should arouse their conscience and live and work in peace. However, on the 2nd and 3rd of this month, while celebrating the New Year, some unruly elements attempted to disrupt local security, using trivial trade matters as an excuse, gathering crowds, giving speeches arbitrarily in Central Street, blocking traffic, disrupting order, and disobeying police intervention, resulting in unfortunate incidents, which is greatly contrary to my consistent intention to protect expatriates. At this time of multiple incidents, I, as the governor, am busy day and night, constantly thinking about protecting expatriates and ensuring security, which should be well known to all parties. These expatriates, whether they have joined the nationality or not, should all share the difficulties of the times and be content with their duties. If there are any actions that endanger security, I, as the governor, for the sake of stabilizing the overall situation, can only enforce the law and will not be lenient in any way. In case of emergency, I will not hesitate to take the most severe measures, such as investigating their names, deporting them, and not allowing them to harm the public and delay the locality. As for the rights and wrongs of this incident, I will definitely investigate the details and handle it fairly, without any bias. This is a special notice.</p>
<p>▲Special Police Administration Notice: It has been investigated that on the evening of the 2nd of this month, a crowd of expatriates suddenly gathered and caused trouble in Daoli Central Street. Traffic was blocked for a time, the momentum was surging, and the atmosphere was tense. The office has briefly notified the public of the course and the actual situation of the settlement of the case. This matter arose from a lawsuit between the Chinese merchant Heshengli Candy Shop and expatriates Jin Duoweichi and others due to suspicion of theft. In fact, it was entirely caused by not understanding the true facts, which led to the spread of errors. The office has reported to the police</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The report from the First Precinct states that on December 31st of last year, a patrol officer from the Shangwu Street Police Station reported that at 6 PM on the same day, Li Yankui, the manager of Heshengli Candy Shop, located at the corner of Central Street and Bread Street, reported that several Russians were shopping in the store, taking the opportunity to steal things, etc. They went to arrest one person, and found Shigeleta candies in his pocket, which the merchant identified as stolen goods. They were sent to the precinct, where the plaintiff Li Yankui was questioned, who provided the same information. The arrested expatriate claimed to be a Lithuanian, named Jin Duoweichi, residing at No. 37, 3rd Street, China, stating that he had come to the store to buy things and did not admit to stealing. Subsequently, the police station sent another stateless expatriate, Ligov, because after the arrest of Jin Duoweichi, the expatriate had assisted several people in causing trouble in the small shop, so they were arrested again. After questioning, he claimed to be 48 years old, residing in Pianlianzi, saying that he had drunk too much alcohol at the end of the year, resulting in indiscretions, etc. The office found that one party accused the other of theft and disturbance, while the other party did not admit it. How was the truth? How was it right and wrong? Without detailed investigation, it was impossible to determine. However, as it was the New Year's holiday, it was not convenient to detain them for a long time, so they were all released on bail the next morning. Unexpectedly, on the evening of January 2nd, a crowd gathered because of this case, and there were various rumors, which were all beyond the facts and reason. The office specifically obtained a certificate from Minina, the legally married wife of the expatriate Jin Duoweichi, proving that her husband had returned home safely and had not been injured or killed. The presentation for consideration and verification came forward, the office detailed the truth of the case, but that's it. It was not of great importance, and the police station had taken precautions and allowed bail to be granted, and listened to the investigation so as to identify the merits of the case and resolve it in accordance with the law. The handling was not very wrong, but at this time, the outside world did not understand the truth, and false statements were rampant, and even used words to frighten the public, and there were even reports that expatriate Jin Duoweichi had died in the hospital. It happened that it was the New Year's holiday, and many expatriates were walking on the streets. Among them, a small number of floating elements, without examining the truth and falsehood, listened to the one-sided propaganda, causing the storm to rise sharply, and a chorus of hundreds of people gathered to cause trouble in the street. They arbitrarily shouted in the street, disobeyed the resolution, and first demanded that the small shop remove the plaque and close the business, and then hindered order, traffic, and even beat up and snatched the police's firearms, and hindered municipal fire trucks from being able to rescue the fire, until midnight before they dispersed. The office has been supervising the police to protect the security achievements for months, as well as the fact that there are military police standing upright, and the strength is sufficient, as everyone knows. For this kind of thing, how can we not forcibly stop it, just to deeply understand that the addition of a temporary addition is blind following, and most of them are expatriate masses without nationality, and usually rely on our police for protection, so we trace the original heart, firmly instruct all officials and police to exercise restraint and self-respect, and are unwilling to rush to apply pressure, only in the distant parts around, arrange prevention, and wait for self-enlightenment, this is the hard work of the office to deal with at that time, which should be understood by all the expatriate masses. Now the office still upholds the spirit of peace and generosity, in addition to investigating whether there are any unscrupulous elements who have other purposes and hope to incite incidents, we will handle them separately, and will not deeply investigate the ignorant youth and expatriate masses. After seeing this notice, the expatriate masses should also live and work in peace, and must not listen to rumors again and bring guilt upon themselves. Regarding the case of the Heshengli small shop and Jin Duoweichi, whether it is theft or false accusation, after a clear investigation, listen to the court's fair decision, and the small shop has temporarily suspended business as the cause of the incident. Jin Duoweichi is safe and sound, and the story of being beaten to death is even more self-defeating. As for the officials and police in charge of this case in the relevant police station, if there are any omissions and dereliction of duty after the investigation, the office will also punish and warn them equally, and will never protect them. In addition to supervising and urging them to handle them separately, it is urgently combined to notify the public.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Bandit Forces in Huangpi Gradually Subdued <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>▲Bandits Building Fortifications in Changxuanling</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Red Bandits of Huangpi, after being jointly suppressed by the Fourth Division of Xu Tingyao, the Thirteenth Division of Xia Douyin, the Thirtieth Division of Li Mingzhong, and the Forty-fourth Division of Xiao Zhichu, have now retreated to Changxuanling, Yanzigang, Tieshidun, and other places. There are no bandit traces near the county seat, and the Pinghan Railway has suffered no losses. It is investigated that Kuang's bandit plan originally intended to seize the Huangpi County seat, destroy the railway, and then take Wuhan. Later, they abandoned the plan to attack the city and detoured south in order to disperse our army's strength and then attempt to defeat them one by one. However, due to the strong force of the government troops, they could not succeed. The number of bandits killed in battle has reached two or three out of ten. At the same time, there was a lack of unified command within the bandits, and the bandit soldiers were mostly coerced and lacked fighting spirit. In order to preserve their strength, Kuang concentrated most of his forces in Changxuanling and other places to build fortifications, hoping to hold on. The remaining small forces are scattered in Wangjiahe, Xujiaqiao, Fengjiaqiao, Hengshan, Changyan, Luohansi, Xinglongji, and other places. About one regiment is stationed in Changyan, and the rest are stationed with a thousand or several hundred. The bandits are not afraid of the pressure of the government troops, but they dare not love war due to internal discord. The government troops have now taken the initiative to make contact and pursue forward. Xu Tingyao, the commander of the Fourth Division, who was supervising the suppression in Hengdian, returned to Hankou on the 8th and met with He Chengjun on the 9th to report everything. It is heard that it is planned to defeat the main force of the bandits before the 15th and then find a way to wipe out the remaining bandits. However, the bandit's den in Changxuanling has strong fortifications, and there are mortars, machine guns, and various combat weapons. When a large-scale attack is launched, there may still be fierce battles. (January 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Closing of the Hubei Provincial Congress of Representatives <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>▲ Election of seven executive committee members and five supervisory committee members</p>
<p>▲ Formal party headquarters can be established according to law</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: The Fourth Hubei Provincial Congress of Party Members was held in the auditorium of the provincial party headquarters at 10:00 AM on the 4th of this month. The congress continued on the 5th, 6th, and 7th. On the 8th, the executive committee members were elected, and the closing ceremony was held on the 9th. The formal provincial party headquarters can now be declared established. The congress lasted six days, including one preparatory meeting and four general sessions.

The proposals for suppressing bandits, totaling more than forty items, were the central issue of the meeting. Therefore, a special discussion was held at the fourth general session on the morning of the 8th. There was no shortage of candidates for the committees. The quota for executive and supervisory committee members was only twelve, but there were as many as seventy or eighty candidates. The election was held on the afternoon of the 8th, with He Chengjun, the central election supervisor, present to supervise the election.

<h3 id="e85">Shanxi Provincial Currency Plunges <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>▲ Slow issuance of financial bonds is the main reason</p>
<p>▲ Tight credit and rising prices in the market</p>
<p>Taiyuan Communication: The provincial government previously obtained approval from the national government and the Legislative Yuan for the issuance of Shanxi Province Financial Reorganization Bonds. Therefore, it originally intended to withdraw the provincial currency, believing it had an eleven-percent grasp of the situation. Thus, in November of last year, it officially announced that starting from the 15th of this year, the provincial currency would be redeemed at a rate of 1 jiao 5 fen per yuan. At the same time, it strictly ordered merchants and others to use the banknotes at a rate of 1 jiao 5 fen in silver before the actual redemption. However, since the promulgation of the announcement, general silver houses and various merchants have held a skeptical attitude. The silver houses even negotiated to temporarily suspend business in an invisible way, expressing opposition to the use of provincial currency at 1 jiao 5 fen. Although ordinary merchants did not dare to openly object on the surface, the prices of goods soared. Because of this, the value of the currency plummeted, and credit became tighter. As of recently, with only half a month left before the redemption date, the central government has not yet approved the issuance of the financial bonds that the provincial government hoped for. The general public is once again taking a wait-and-see attitude regarding the redemption on January 15th, and the value of the currency has plummeted, becoming increasingly severe. In the black market, it is not easy to buy one yuan of silver with eleven or twelve yuan of provincial currency. The provincial government authorities, seeing this situation, are deeply worried. Yesterday, they announced to the public the difficulty of redeeming on schedule on January 15th, in order to dispel public doubts. The full text of the announcement is recorded below to show a glimpse of the financial future of Shanxi Province: [Since the price of provincial currency has declined,</p>
<p>the financial situation in the market has been extremely chaotic, and merchants and the public alike feel difficulties, and tax revenues have also been affected. If relief is not sought early, not only will all industries wither, but also government administration will be difficult to carry out. However, the face value of the currency is huge, and the treasury has few funds. To completely withdraw it, we rely on the recovery of financial bonds. Therefore, since its reorganization, the provincial government has repeatedly telegraphed the central government and sent representatives to make urgent requests. Fortunately, considering the hardships, it agreed to restore the last ten days of last month. Received a telegram from Ma, a member of the provincial government, stating that the bond regulations have been reviewed and passed by the Legislative Yuan and stipulate that they will be issued on January 1, 1932. The provincial government deeply believes that from now on, the province’s finances can be reorganized with this, and the suffering of merchants and the public can be relieved with this. Therefore, resolutely decided at the 15th temporary meeting of the provincial government on the 20th of last month to pre-announce the withdrawal measures to comfort the public. Unexpectedly, the national government has not yet announced it after many days. The provincial government, feeling the urgency of the situation, could not wait any longer. It again telegraphed the Executive Yuan to quickly submit it to the national government for announcement and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to print the banknotes for issuance at that time. Recently, received a telegram from the Executive Yuan, stating that it has been forwarded to the national government for verification, etc. Later, received an urgent telegram from Ma, stating that the central government is busy preparing for the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and the Ministry of Finance is rushing to hand over matters, and no one is proposing the announcement of the regulations, and the banknotes cannot be printed based on them, etc. The withdrawal of provincial currency in this province was originally based on government bonds as the only source of funds. Now that the government bonds have not been received as scheduled, the previous proposal to exchange government bonds with provincial currency at 40% on January 1, 1932, cannot be implemented. At the same time, the funds designated for borrowing with government bonds cannot be established. The method of exchanging each yuan of provincial currency for 1 jiao 5 fen in silver on January 15 is also difficult to achieve as scheduled. Although the provincial government is deeply worried, the government bonds are delayed due to some reason, and the matter has changed suddenly, and there is nothing that can be done. However, the provincial government’s determination to withdraw the provincial currency will never be relaxed because of this. In addition to urging the central government to announce it as soon as possible, we are still raising cash. Once the government bonds are received, we will set another date and still handle it according to the original proposal, and we will never change our original intention due to the central government’s delay, causing panic among the merchants and the public of the entire Shanxi Province. For this reason, this announcement is made, and all merchants and the public are informed, and do not generate doubts and cause disturbances, which is most important.] (January 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Liu Guitang Requests No Troops Be Sent to Monitor <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Communication: Liu Guitang, Guo Mafeng and their troops gathered at Dakou and boarded trains to Gaotang in northern Shandong for reorganization. Han Fuju, for the sake of prudence, specifically ordered the Beiping armored train and troops along the route to be prepared. Last night, Gu Liangmin, commander of the 22nd Division stationed in Yanzhou, and Liu Shuxiang, director of the staff office of the headquarters, telegraphed Han to report that Liu Guitang had sent Xia Ziming as a representative to Yanzhou. According to Xia, Liu, Guo and their troops were eager to surrender and had already marched from Dabianqiao to Dakou on foot on the 7th. However, they were uneasy about the news of the armored train and troops along the route monitoring them and requested: 1) Do not send armored trains and troops to monitor them; 2) After gathering at Dakou, immediately conduct the reorganization so that they can search for the remaining bandits in the mountains nearby. After the reorganization, they are willing to go to Gaotang on foot and do not want to take the train; 3) At the beginning of the pacification, they should be treated with leniency to show magnanimity and avoid complications. Liu, Guo and their troops made this request because they were aware of the three incidents that occurred during Zhang Zongchang’s time, when they boarded trains at Dakou during reorganization. After receiving the telegram, Han telegraphed Liu’s representative Xia Ziming to come to Ji today (the 8th) for consultation and decision. The outgoing and incoming telegrams are recorded below: (Gu</p>
<p>Liangmin’s telegram) Limited to immediate arrival, addressed to Commander Han Jun, Zimi: 1) The Yuwucan telegram has been received. Liu Guitang’s representative Xia Ziming came to Yan and stated that the troops are very sincere about surrendering, and Yu has already departed from Bianqiao. If armored trains and troops are sent to monitor them, I am afraid that misunderstandings will occur, which would be unfortunate. Please do not send armored trains and troops to show good faith. Please telegraph instructions on whether this is acceptable. 2) According to Xia Ziming, Liu, Guo and others want to be reorganized at Dakou in order to recruit the remaining bandits from Nanshan. When they depart in the future, they are willing to go on foot and do not want to take the train. 3) At the beginning of the incorporation, they should be treated with leniency to show magnanimity. If there are too many restrictions, complications may arise. Please make a decision. Yours respectfully, Gu Liangmin Liu Xunxiang, Yu Shen. (Han Fuju’s reply) Limited to immediate arrival, addressed to Yanzhou Division Commander Gu Jingxuan, Director Liu Weizhen: The Yu Shen telegram reporting the requests of the representatives of Liu, Guo and their troops has been received. Please have Xia Ziming come to Ji quickly for detailed discussion and decision. This is the reply. Han Fuju, Qi Shen Yin Can.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Qingdao Party Affairs in Dispute <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>▲ Lower-level party departments oppose the municipal party department</p>
<p>▲ Declare secession and form a separate office</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication: Disputes have also arisen in Qingdao’s party affairs. Yesterday, the executive and supervisory committee members of various districts and branches held a joint meeting and resolved that, starting from the 7th, all lower-level party departments and all party members would sever ties with the current municipal party department. On the one hand, they telegraphed the central government to report the misdeeds of the members of the municipal party department and requested a thorough reorganization. On the other hand, they established a joint office of the district party departments to temporarily carry out the city’s party affairs. They also issued a declaration, publicizing the misdeeds of the executive and supervisory committee members, listing a total of ten items. At the same time, the municipal party department also issued a letter to all party members in the city today, advising all party members to prioritize the country’s interests when the country is facing difficulties and not to be provoked by others, giving others an opportunity to take advantage of. It is divided into four key points: 1) Party comrades should unite sincerely and overcome national difficulties together; 2) This association is happy to accept any suggestions from comrades in the city. Within the scope of possibility, we are willing to work with comrades in the city to plan and proceed to perfect party affairs day by day. 3) When foreign insults are imminent, we should strictly abide by order and make arduous struggles; otherwise, we are creating opportunities for imperialists, which is like inviting thieves into the house, and although we love the country on the surface, we are actually harming the country. 4) The country is on the verge of peril. All comrades should take the national interest as the prerequisite and should not be nitpicking and alienating the people, speaking for the imperialists. Finally, it is said that party comrades should strive in time and engage in disciplined national salvation undertakings, and not allow the slightest retreat to foreign enemies, and be sincere to comrades in the party, etc. It is not yet certain whether the lower-level party departments will end their activities due to this advice.

<p>Kidnapping Case Cracked in Fengxian. The 6th District Xulibao Security Group has recently received reports that there are kidnapped victims hidden in Bizheng Township, about three li from the town. Last night (the 8th) at 12 o’clock, they led the entire team to rush to the back of a Lu family farmhouse in that area and found a male child victim. Two bandits who were watching the victim, Lu Xingsheng and Yuan Lushi, were also arrested on the spot and taken back to the team for questioning overnight. According to Lu, the child was kidnapped from Ganpu Town, Haiyan, Zhejiang, and was sent by a friend from Shanghai on December 26 of last year to be raised. Yuan Lushi said that Xingsheng was her nephew. The day before yesterday, he said that someone was raising a child and gave her two yuan as wages, so she dared to take him in, and she didn't know anything else. The child was further interrogated and could speak. He claimed to be surnamed Chen, named Guan, five years old, living in Dongjie, Ganpu, Haiyan. His father was a businessman in Shanghai. This time, because of the major robbery in Putown, he was taken out by Lu Xingsheng, laid on the boat for many days until he arrived in the countryside a few days ago and was looked after by the old woman (referring to Yuan Lushi), and was not allowed to come out, etc. However, he claimed not to know the name of his parents. According to the confession of the district office, in addition to sending the two bandits to the county for interrogation today, they also asked the county to send the police to go to the county to find out where they are, so that they can be claimed.</p>

<p>Conflict Between Police Team and Security Group. The Xigang Town District Office in Nansha District of this county originally had a security group to maintain local security. On the morning of the 9th, five or six members of the group went to Donglai Town to meet the group leader. However, the members who went were all in plain clothes, and they were wearing box cannons. After arriving in Donglai Town, the group leader was not found. One of the members suddenly played with the box cannon for some reason and fired three shots with live ammunition. Yang, the sergeant of the town police team, heard about it and immediately led the police to investigate. They saw many people in plain clothes holding box cannons and went forward to question them. They replied that they were security members here to meet the group leader. When they checked their badges, they found that they were not carrying them. Because the police team suspected them, they confiscated their guns and arrested the five people in plain clothes at the police team headquarters. The Xigang Security Group also sent a telegram to testify, but because the badges were incomplete, they could not be tolerated during this winter defense period. It is decided that the five arrested persons will be sent to the general team headquarters in the city on the 10th to await disposal.</p>
<p>Dispute Between Village Teachers and Pond School Over School Buildings. The school buildings of the rural normal school in Pucheng District of this county were originally connected to Tangqiao Elementary School. Before the rural normal school was opened, Tangqiao Elementary School borrowed many rooms. Later, after the Education Bureau built a new school building for Tangqiao Elementary School, the rural normal school planned to take back the old school building. However, Xu Peineng, the principal of Tangqiao Elementary School, refused to hand it over. The Education Bureau had ordered them to hand it over three times without any effect. The other day, Xiao Li, the principal of the rural normal school, notified the school on the one hand, and on the other hand, moved out the desks of Tangqiao Elementary School. As a result, students' books and stationery were scattered and lost. Therefore, the elementary school students went to question Xiao Li, the principal of the rural normal school, in teams. It is not known why a violent conflict occurred, resulting in the serious injury of three students from Tangqiao Elementary School. They immediately went to the city to ask the county for an examination of the injuries. The school immediately went on strike and formed a team to march, give speeches, distribute leaflets, paste slogans, and shout slogans such as "Down with Xiao Li, the principal of the rural normal school." The Education Bureau heard the report and sent Xu Zhirui, the head of the social education section, to the countryside on the 8th to investigate. As of the afternoon of the 9th, Tangqiao Elementary School had not resumed classes. However, according to news from the rural normal school, it was said that there was no such thing as beating students from Tangqiao Elementary School. Only that on the afternoon of the 7th, when the students from Tangqiao Elementary School rushed into the rural normal school, many students fell to the ground, and there were photos to prove it. The three injured students from Tangqiao Elementary School have been examined and confirmed by the county that they have injuries. In the future, the principals of the two schools will inevitably confront each other in court.</p>

<p>Kidnapping occurred outside the Water West Gate. Since winter, robberies have occurred one after another in the four villages around here, but they are all in places a little far from the city. Suddenly, last night at about 8 o'clock, more than 20 bandits broke into the Lujiahuayuan Village near the Shuixi Gate, robbing more than a dozen households along the door without any exception. Before leaving, they kidnapped a young girl surnamed Lü who was 18 years old and took away six oxen.

<p>Fushi girl commits suicide by drowning. The Fushi Girls' Middle School outside the East Gate was founded by an American Christian. It has more than 280 female students. The other day (</p>
<p>8th), a female student named Dong Huamei suddenly committed suicide by drowning in the Zhongshan Gate in the early morning. The reason is unknown. Dong is a Suzhou native, 17 years old. Because her father gambled and bankrupted the family, her mother worked as a helper outside and sold her daughter to a brothel. Later, Gu Shigang, a Shanghai native, saw her pitiful background and redeemed her to study at Fushi. After she had committed suicide in the sixth grade, the school principal, Wang Shengshan, took her back after being examined by the Public Security Bureau and telegraphed Gu Shigang in Shanghai to come to Cheng to handle the matter.</p>

They explained their aspirations to the school authorities and wanted to leave the school to join the army. The school authorities did not grant their request because the students Huang Meiding and others were too young (the ages of the five students were all under 15 years old). The students were very angry because they did not get permission from the school authorities and secretly ran away together on the morning of the 7th to join the army.</p>

<p>Representatives of Fishermen's Associations from Various Counties Petition. This morning, the representatives of fishermen's associations from various counties in Jiangsu Province went to the provincial government and the departments of civil affairs, finance, and industry with petitions. The petitions included two points: 1) Fishermen often have salt used by salt police in various places colluding with unscrupulous fishers to extort money from the fishermen. Please ask the provincial government to consult the Ministry of Finance to strictly prohibit it and issue a prohibition. 2) The water police in various places cannot protect the fishermen and are sometimes harmed by them. The fishermen's self-defense groups are difficult to unify under the administration of the county government and have various difficulties. It is proposed to abolish or reduce the scope of the four district water police and reorganize all military equipment into fishery police. If the government's funds are insufficient, the local government will raise them on its own. The provincial government was represented by Section Chief He, who agreed to convey the message to Chairman Gu. Director Zhao of the Department of Civil Affairs personally came out to meet them and expressed acceptance and consideration. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Sun, Wu, Kong, and Yang to Travel to Ningbo by Steamer Today <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>▲Proceeding to Xikou to Meet Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>▲Zhang Jingjiang and Others Will Also Go to Meet Him</p>
<p>▲National Crisis Demands His Swift Return</p>
<p>▲Sun Cables Hong Kong and Guangzhou, Urging Hu to Come to the Capital</p>
<p>Sun Ke, the President of the Executive Yuan, had originally planned to travel to Hangzhou yesterday morning by car, and then proceed to Fenghua to personally meet Chiang Kai-shek and urge him to come to the capital to jointly salvage the critical situation. However, because traveling to Hangzhou would involve a roundabout route, causing too many transfers and wasting time, it was decided after discussion that they would instead take the Ning-Shao Company's new Ning-Shao steamer at 5:00 PM today, heading directly to Ningbo. Those traveling with Sun to Xikou by long-distance bus are Wu Tiecheng, Kong Xiangxi, Yang Shuzhuang, a party of four, and their staff.</p>
<p>Upon returning to Shanghai on the 13th, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Kong Xiangxi, Yang Shuzhuang, and their party decided on their travel date yesterday. Yesterday morning, they telegraphed Fenghua to notify Chiang. Simultaneously, the municipal government telegraphed Wang Shihe, Chiang's adjutant, requesting him to send someone to meet them at the dock and prepare long-distance buses to go directly to Xikou. They are scheduled to arrive in Ningbo at 6:00 AM on the 12th and expect to meet with Chiang around 8:00 AM. According to Wu Tiecheng's statement to our newspaper reporter, they hope to return to Shanghai on the 13th after meeting with Chiang.</p>
<p>▲Zhang Ji and Others to Follow. Our newspaper reporter interviewed Wu Tiecheng yesterday, who said that the national situation is now critical, and the people of the country unanimously hope that Hu, Wang, and Chiang will jointly come forward to maintain the overall situation. Mr. Chiang had previously stated that his personal advancement or retreat would depend on the will of the people of the country. Therefore, at this critical moment, Mr. Chiang will surely respond to the unanimous demand of the people and come to the capital. We four will first take a steamer to Ningbo tomorrow (i.e., today) and return after meeting with Chiang. Mr. Zhang Ji, Zhang Jingjiang, Ye Chucang, and others will continue to go to Fenghua to urge his swift return. It is expected that they will be able to set off in two or three days.</p>
<p>Yu Youren Not Coming Yet. Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, did not come to Shanghai yesterday morning. The central government has already appointed Yu as a representative to go to Hong Kong to urge Hu Hanmin to come to the capital. Yu is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the capital this morning and take a steamer to Hong Kong on the 13th.</p>
<p>Chen Youren Arrives in Shanghai. Foreign Minister Chen Youren arrived in Shanghai from the capital by car at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. He is staying at Sun Ke's residence on Moliai Road and is scheduled to return to the capital today.</p>
<p>Sun Visits Huang Hanliang. Around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Sun Ke drove to visit Finance Minister Huang Hanliang to discuss ways to maintain financial stability. The discussion lasted a long time before they concluded.</p>
<p>▲Sun Cables Hu Hanmin. After deciding on the date to go to Fenghua yesterday, Sun cabled Hu Hanmin to inform him and urged him with the most sincere words to overcome his illness and go north. At the same time, he also cabled Tang Shaochuan and others in Guangzhou, asking them to urge Hu nearby. The original texts of the two telegrams are recorded below. To Mr. Hu Zhantang, 8 Miaogao Terrace, Hong Kong: The national crisis has reached a point where it is truly the last test of whether our party can take on the responsibility of saving the country. I have been in the capital for two weeks, but the central government is empty, and without guidance, major plans for foreign affairs and domestic administration cannot be carried out. The previous declaration to the people of the whole country that we would unite as a party to save the country is now impossible to answer the people. After repeated consideration, I can only make the most sincere request to you, Mr. Wang, and Mr. Chiang. Mr. Wang has indicated that his illness has slightly subsided and he will do his best to come to the capital. Comrades in the capital have decided to ask Mr. Yu Youren to represent them in going to Hong Kong to urge your return. I am also scheduled to go to Fenghua tomorrow to urge Mr. Chiang. I hope that you, for the sake of the party and the country, will put aside everything and come to the capital immediately. This is not only my personal plea, but also the unanimous appeal of the people of the whole country and all comrades in the party. Sun Ke bows (10th).</p>
<p>Telegraph to Tang Shaochuan and Others. To Mr. Tang Shaochuan, Mr. Deng Zhiru, Mr. Xiao Focheng, Mr. Chen Bonan, Mr. Liu Jiwen in Guangzhou, and convey to all comrades, and to Mr. Wu Tiyun, Mr. Chen Choushuo, Mr. Zhang Huichang in Hong Kong: The greatest goal of the plenary session of the First National Congress is to unite our party and resolve the national crisis. This is truly the unanimous demand of the whole country and the whole party today. However, since the fall of Jinzhou, the people of the country have been calling out, but Mr. Hu, Wang, and Chiang have not been able to resolutely come to the capital. Therefore, the central government is empty and everything is stagnant. A person without any real power is forced to bear the responsibility of the central administration, which is exhausting and does not help the country. After repeated consideration, I can only make the most sincere request to Mr. Hu, Wang, and Chiang to save this dying party and country. Mr. Wang has indicated that his illness has slightly improved and he will come to the capital even if he has to be supported by his illness, so there should be no problem. I have decided to go to Fenghua tomorrow to urge Mr. Chiang to come to the capital immediately. At the same time, comrades in the capital have entrusted Mr. Yu Youren to go to Hong Kong to urge Mr. Hu to overcome his illness and take up his post to jointly shoulder the great responsibility. We must do our best to carry out this movement of uniting to save the country. For me personally, what I do for the party and the country lies in this one move. If I still do not get the approval of the three gentlemen, I can only resign and dare not prolong this situation, which would delay the party and the country. I also urge all comrades to unanimously advocate and urge Mr. Hu to come north immediately. I await and pray. Sun Ke bows (10th).</p>
<h3 id="e102">Yesterday, University Students Held a Memorial Service for Yang Tongheng <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>▲Thousands of Students Participated</p>
<p>▲Parade with the Coffin in the British and French Concessions</p>
<p>▲Police Intervention Caused Minor Disturbances</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation held a memorial service for Yang Tongheng, a student who died during a petition in Nanjing, at the Public Sports Field in Nanshi at 10:00 AM yesterday. Several thousands of people from all walks of life participated. The atmosphere at the venue was quite solemn. Students who went to Nanjing reported on the martyr's death. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Organizations. Most of the participants yesterday were from the student community. Many representatives from major middle schools and universities attended, including students from Jinan University, Guanghua University, Fudan University, School of Law and Political Science, Jiaotong University, Xinhua Art College, Guanghua Middle School Attached, Fudan Middle School Attached, Datong Middle School Attached, and other schools, as well as the Chinese People's Foreign Affairs Support Association, various labor unions, totaling about two thousand people.</p>
<p>Coffin at the Venue (Photo by Wang Kai)</p>
<p>▲Venue Arrangement. The venue was at the Public Sports Field, with an altar in the center, a portrait of martyr Yang Tongheng hanging above, and many elegiac couplets hanging on the sides. There were also wreaths sent by various students, placed on both sides. The weather was cloudy and gloomy, and the north wind was piercingly cold. Flags flew in the air, creating a very sad atmosphere.</p>
<p>▲Proceedings. The meeting began at 10:45 AM. Initially, student Wen Sheng reported on Yang's death in Nanjing, the details of which were reported in the newspapers at the time. In addition to female students, many women participated in the audience, many of whom wept incessantly. After the report, everyone bowed three times to the portrait, and the chairman presented a wreath.</p>
<p>▲Parade in the Concessions. After the meeting, the crowd carried Yang's coffin and paraded. They departed from the Public Sports Field, crossed Fangxie Road and entered Zhonghua Road, turned to Minguo Road, exited the Xiaobeimen, reached the Great World on Xizang Road, arrived at Nanjing Road, turned east to Sizhong Road, and then went north to Sichuan Road Bridge and Tianqiao Road. At this point, they were dispersed by Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Concession police.</p>
<p>Police Surveillance. During the parade, the British and French concessions, fearing that the students marching in formation would cause trouble, sent detectives to monitor. At the borders of the Chinese, French, and British concessions, temporary martial law was implemented, and the small iron gates at the borders were tightly closed, cutting off traffic and creating a very serious situation.</p>
<p>Disturbances. There were over a thousand people in the parade. When they reached the Public Concession, the Central Police Station sent Chinese and Western detectives to monitor them. The detectives were armed with guns and ammunition, and red armored vehicles carrying armed police officers slowly followed behind. When they reached Broadway Road, because the area was very narrow, the large number of people in the parade caused a sudden interruption of traffic. The police then dispersed them, and the crowd had no choice but to disperse. It was reported that one student was arrested at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Yang's Coffin Placed. After the parade, the coffin of martyr Yang Tongheng was carried by the crowd, but was blocked on Broadway Road. It was then moved to the Sichuan Businessmen's Association on Jiangwan Road in Zhabei. Because Yang was from Sichuan, his family members are coming to Shanghai as soon as possible and plan to transport his body back to his hometown.</p>

<p>▲Christian Youth Should Have Revolutionary Spirit</p>
<p>According to Zhonghua News Agency, Mr. Feng Huanzhang was invited to give a speech at the Zhongshan Hall on the fifth floor of the National YMCA of China on Museum Road in Shanghai yesterday (10th) at 3:00 PM. The audience was extremely crowded. After the chairman introduced him, Mr. Feng Huanzhang began his speech, briefly stating, "During this time of national crisis, our only responsibility is how to overcome this national crisis and how to prevent the words 'slave of a fallen nation' from being placed on our heads. We can only demonstrate the spirit of Christian youth from the time of the founding of the Republic to turn the tide." In the past, most revolutionaries were Christian youth who desperately worked forward, with a spirit of perseverance. If they failed, they would hide in the YMCA and do work. When there was an opportunity, they would go to the people to do revolutionary work. We Christian youth now need that kind of spirit to overcome this national crisis. Now society has become a society where dragons beget dragons, phoenixes beget phoenixes, and mice raise children who know how to burrow. To be honest, it has become a state where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The rich eat thousands of gold a day and can receive higher education, receiving all material civilization early. The poor are born without the opportunity to receive education. When they are sick, they do not have money to see a doctor, so they just wait to die. In the end, the poor can only die of illness. Then look at the opium prohibition. It is really a good strategy for military and political dignitaries to make profits. Trafficking in opium, shipping opium, smoking opium at home, running rampant and illegally, no one dares to question him. If ordinary people buy a few opium pills to treat stomach pain, once they are discovered, they will be imprisoned for several months and fined. Again, like gambling, ordinary people play cards for entertainment and are arrested by the police station, and they will be fined or beaten with small boards before they can be released. However, military and political dignitaries usually play a few rounds of mahjong, and political expenses and military salaries are sacrificed for their pleasure. As a result, political institutions are in arrears of salaries, and soldiers are in arrears of pay. Who dares to question and punish them? Such a policy of 'only state officials are allowed to set fires, but ordinary people are not allowed to light lamps' makes everyone resentful and indignant, but who dares to say it? We should have a fearless spirit to expose his crimes, like Christ being crucified for the sake of mankind. Secondly, the YMCA itself should be revolutionary and strive for human happiness and sacrifice its own happiness in order to be worthy of being a great Christian youth. We do not need those missionary-style YMCAs and Great World-style YMCAs to exist. I hope all Christian youth will encourage each other to move forward." Mr. Feng's speech lasted about half an hour before it ended.</p>

<p>▲Each Gave Intense Speeches</p>
<p>According to the Riri News Agency, Sun Hongyi and others convened the first discussion meeting of the Constitutionalism Promotion Association at the China News Agency at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. More than a hundred people attended, including Sun Hongyi, Zhang Yaozeng, Chu Fucheng, and others. Sun Hongyi was elected as chairman, and Chen Dingyuan as secretary. First, Mr. Sun reported on the purpose of initiating this association, which is to promote constitutionalism so that the people of the whole country have a common path to face the national crisis. The failure of diplomacy lies in poor domestic administration. The reason why domestic administration is poor is that in recent years, the Kuomintang has been a one-party dictatorship, knowing only the party and not the country, knowing only party members and not the people. Therefore, saving the country must begin with overthrowing the one-party dictatorship. Wu Shan then recounted the disadvantages of the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship, using extremely intense language. Lin Suyuan then spoke, briefly stating that political movements should henceforth be based on the welfare of the people of the whole country. The Kuomintang is based on party members, and we should be based on the people. In addition, many people spoke with largely the same wording. Finally, the discussion proceeded, and the following decisions were made: (1) The name was set as the Constitutionalism Promotion Association; (2) Sun Hongyi, Luo Jiaheng, Hu Zushun, Jiang Tianduo, Lin Suyuan, Zhao Zunyue, Wang Zaoshi, Chen Bojian, Zhu Qinglai Fan Hongjun, Chen Dingyuan, and other eleven people were elected as temporary preparatory members; (3) The draft declaration and constitution were approved; (4) It was decided to hold an inaugural meeting next Sunday.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau Strike Wave: Mediation Failed Last Night <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>▲All Crew Members Presented Five Conditions</p>
<p>▲Tu Nan, Yu Shun and Other Vessels Joined the Strike</p>
<p>After all crew members of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau launched a strike due to the issue of double pay, Du Yuesheng and others stepped in to mediate. The crew members presented conditions. Yesterday, the Tu Nan and Yu Shun vessels joined the strike. At 8 PM, Du</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Yuesheng’s residence held a meeting to resolve the matter. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Crew Members' Conditions: All crew members of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau, through a general meeting resolution, yesterday dispatched representatives Jin Yueshi, Xi Wenfang, etc., to the private residence of mediator Du Yuesheng to discuss the following demands: 1. Issue a year-end double pay of one month. 2. Recognize the Seamen's Union. 3. Equal treatment with bureau staff. 4. No arbitrary dismissal of crew members. 5. Year-end double pay is permanent. Mr. Du agreed to be responsible for the first, second, and third of the crew's demands and verbally agreed to the fourth and fifth, but a final decision would be made after discussing with China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau Commissioner Guo Waifeng at 6 PM.</p>
<p>▲Forming a Union: Among the prerequisites previously resolved by all crew members in a general meeting, the formation of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau Seamen's Union was deemed necessary. To expedite preparations for its establishment, a general meeting was held at 2 PM yesterday at 38 Avenue Edward VII to discuss preparatory matters. It was also resolved that preparations would begin immediately and the union would be established in the shortest possible time to benefit the labor movement.</p>
<p>▲Two Vessels Joined the Strike: Originally, thirteen ships were on strike, remaining anchored at the South Bund wharf and the river channel, awaiting resolution of the double pay issue. Yesterday, the sea-going vessels Tu Nan and Yu Shun also encountered Shanghai after arriving in Shanghai. Their crew members and sailors all reported to the union and unanimously joined the strike. As of yesterday, there were five Changjiang ships and ten offshore vessels on strike. If the issue is not resolved today, the returning Xinjiangtian must also strike. ▲Labor-Capital Meeting: Around 8 PM last night, the crew members received a notification from mediators Du, Li, and Yang, stating that the representative appointed by the capital side, Yu Qiaqing, had already consulted with Guo Waifeng and would soon arrive at Du's residence, inviting representatives of the staff to discuss a peaceful resolution. During the meeting, it was learned that Jin Yueshi, Gong Wenfang, Che Defang, and others were again elected as authorized representatives to go to the mediators' office to discuss the double pay issue. It is reported that there were no significant results, and discussions will continue today. Third Declaration: China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau Crew Members' Double Pay Petition, Third Declaration: We, the undersigned, petition for fair treatment from the authorities, but our petitions are ignored, and we have no choice but to take action. For the past day or two, we have been grateful to Mr. Li, Du, and Yang for their mediation efforts, allowing the Xinjiangtian to sail, and a resolution seemed near. However, the bureau, showing no sincerity, suddenly fabricated reports to the Municipal Government, attempting to deceive and shift blame. At the same time, they continued to argue strongly against our demands, attempting to unconditionally order the ships to sail. Their intention is to further suppress us, evade responsibility, and confuse the public, deploying a two-pronged approach, which is truly a masterful tactic. We must refute this. Just read the letter from the commissioner to the Municipal Government: first, they accuse us of unauthorized strikes and work stoppages; second, they accuse us of inciting others to join. What kind of language is this? Would a sincere collaborator utter such words lightly? The commissioner recklessly fabricates accusations, only exposing his own vicious methods. It must be understood that we are demanding equal treatment and double pay because the bureau refused to accept it, which led to the petition. When the petition failed to yield results and we faced threats of dismissal and layoffs, we stopped work and waited quietly. Therefore, we are petitioning without success and waiting quietly; we have not gone on strike, let alone incited others. Although the ships are on strike, all work, such as unloading cargo, continues as usual. Can there be such a thing as a strike like this? Our demands for double pay are spontaneous and unanimous; where does this talk of incitement come from? Although the commissioner may believe in his own integrity, he has already pocketed his double pay. However, as soon as we made our demand, he did not hesitate to use all sorts of accusations against us. We deeply regret this for the commissioner. As for the arrears in salary, the commissioner's ability to raise and pay them is, in fact, a kind of effort, and we express our gratitude. But in principle, we believe that it is the commissioner's sole responsibility. If he insists on claiming credit for this, what can we say? As for oppression, the crew members offer a few examples. Kuaili's old mate originally earned 160 yuan, but when he was transferred to the larger ship Jiangjing, his salary was arbitrarily reduced by 20 yuan. Chen Baitao, qualified as a second mate, received a salary of 100 yuan from the bureau. After repeatedly acting as chief mate, he was assigned to Jianghua as a second mate due to disagreements, and his salary was reduced to 80 yuan. Furthermore, He Hailan and Chen Baitao, both resident crew members of the bureau, received double pay in 1919, but in 1920, the authorities arbitrarily revoked it. The bureau's chief engineer, who bears significant responsibility on board, receives a maximum salary of only 180 yuan. Requests for a salary increase are ignored. They also force sea-going vessels to leave port at night, falsely claiming that Bai Mao Shoal can be crossed in the dark, and arbitrarily record demerits. All kinds of oppression are both annoying and ridiculous. Rice subsidies were negotiated by the Navigation Association, not a special favor from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau, and were not implemented by Guo Ren. Why is he taking credit for them? Now he suddenly raises the issue of cheap rice. May we ask if the commissioner intends to advocate for reducing food rations? The situation on land and on water is completely different, as the commissioner is well aware. Why does he use the value of the numbers to deliberately make irrelevant arguments, deceiving the ordinary public? If Western food is brought up, it is completely irrelevant. It must be understood that the cost on board is more than 40 yuan to obtain the same quality of goods worth a little over 10 yuan on land. Moreover, only the captain, chief mate, and chief engineer enjoy this benefit on board. These three are of the same rank as section chiefs in the bureau. How does their salary compare to that of section chiefs? Section chiefs have public funds and can eat and drink as much as they want. Furthermore, rights and obligations are reciprocal. Bureau staff have a fixed working time of six hours per day, while crew members work more than twelve hours at sea, not counting overtime. Even in port, they work more than eight hours. Crew members sacrifice all happiness and opportunities; how can they be compared to bureau staff? This is why the maritime laws of various countries have various preferential provisions for crew members. Now, the commissioner abruptly views this as surprising and wants to overturn global practice. Wouldn't this make knowledgeable people sneer? If he insists on thinking that crew members enjoy excessive benefits, then we are willing to sacrifice the preferential treatment and receive the salaries of bureau staff, but only if we can open the ship at 9 a.m., anchor at 12 p.m., reopen at 2 p.m., and anchor at 5 p.m. for the night, and then go to the dog races and dance halls after 5 p.m. We are willing to remain silent on this. Does the commissioner consider this fair? Can he agree to it? As for paid leave, the ship and the bureau are the same; what are the advantages and disadvantages? Furthermore, crew members each have their own duties. Does the commissioner intend to have colleagues act as substitutes? Isn't this a big joke? It must be understood that there must be section chiefs with special connections in the bureau to rotate like a revolving lantern, but crew members cannot do this in reality, and the law does not allow it (according to Customs regulations, if one crew member is missing, departure is prohibited. May we ask if the commissioner knows this?). Now, the commissioner, as the head of the nation's unique shipping agency, lacks this basic knowledge of the shipping industry. We cannot help but sigh. Moreover, it is not a happy life for one to be sick, and we do not expect to enjoy preferential treatment because of it. If someone considers it happy, then we are also willing to sincerely donate medical expenses. As for the value of the bureau's assets, it is of great importance, and we do not want to investigate the mysteries within. In short, if Commissioner Guo has the sincerity to care for the crew members, he should accept our demands as soon as possible. Why must he constantly compare the benefits of crew members and bureau staff, provoking resentment within the bureau? Otherwise, the work of crew members is risky and arduous, while the work of bureau staff is safe and fixed. The facts are so. Does the commissioner have a conscience? Why must he argue strongly? Is he being too verbose and exerting himself too much? This declaration is intended as a response.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Postal Workers' Union Letter to All Fellow Workers <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>▲According to Chen Si Yi</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union respectfully addresses this letter to all postal workers. Fellow postal workers, since the invasion of the brutal Japanese and the escalating national crisis, the union has been heartbroken and has organized the Two-Association Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee to specifically handle Anti-Japanese National Salvation affairs, hoping to fulfill the duties of a citizen. On the one hand, we assess the state of the domestic situation and the hardships of the postal environment; on the other hand, we recognize that the pain of postal workers has not been alleviated. Therefore, we exert our best efforts, intelligence, and strength to maintain good systems in the postal service, stabilize the economic foundation of the postal service, improve the postal service itself, and reform the treatment of postal workers. In the past few months, we have been fortunate to avoid collapse. However, we see that national affairs are deteriorating, internal troubles are multiplying, and the union's affairs are numerous. If we seek to address everything comprehensively, we must rely on the collective wisdom and strength of all fellow workers to urge and encourage each other and work together. It is difficult to achieve success alone. Therefore, we sincerely present several points, hoping that all our fellow workers will encourage each other. At the beginning of the new year, Jinzhou fell, and Tianjin and Peking are in danger. Although the new government has been established, its actions are perfunctory and ambiguous, and everything is new. Our postal workers occupy a central position as citizens, and every action affects the overall situation. In this critical time of survival, we should all cherish the ambition to save the nation and uphold the pure mentality of loving the country. Sharpen our spirits, align our steps, and engage in the training of volunteer soldiers. We should all have the determination to sever economic ties with the enemy. Everyone should contribute their wisdom to make up for the country's salvation, sincerely consult, and seek sound planning, so that the union can draw on everyone's strengths and earnestly engage in the work of Anti-Japanese National Salvation. In this way, we can achieve strength through unity and everyone can fulfill their duties, persist in endurance, and certainly achieve the actual effect of resistance. This is the first meaning of unity to jointly overcome national difficulties. The postal service is the second life of all fellow workers. In recent years, evil internal forces have invaded, such as the separate establishment of the Chu Jing Bureau and the misappropriation of large sums of money to subsidize other parasitic organizations. These are all major tumors that endanger the postal service. Our fellow workers should be deeply aware of the warning of the destruction of both the nest and the eggs, and fear the collapse of the building. We must all unite and resist strongly, so that we can drive away the demons and restore the health of the postal service. We should also persist in endurance, adhere to our duties, and cultivate the postal service itself, so that it will gradually prosper and grow into a bright future. This is the second meaning of removing obstacles to the postal service and promoting postal business. The improvement of postal workers' treatment is limited by the postal economy and cannot be satisfactory. The implementation of postal affairs is limited by the difficulties of the times and is not as expected. For example, the performance evaluation test has not yet been officially cancelled, and the promotion tests suggested by the union have not yet been officially implemented. For example, the boundaries of the branches in this city have been expanded, but the number of mail carriers has not yet been increased. For example, savings insurance and welfare for postal workers have not yet been established. For example, postal routes have not yet been restored. All these are still major issues. There are countless other trivial matters that the union is concerned about and will exert its utmost effort to promote progress. However, the interests of our fellow workers are at stake, and we must exert our sincere efforts and fight together. This is the third meaning of exhausting our efforts to seek thorough liberation. Furthermore, postal workers are the masters of the postal service, and the postal workers' union is a collective of postal workers. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that the postal workers' union is the "Ah Dou" of the entire postal service. In recent years, postal workers' unions have sprung up in various parts of the country, achieving remarkable results. However, after the promulgation of the Trade Union Law in 1929, the special regulations for trade union organizations were abruptly cancelled. The trade unions of postal and other special industries suddenly lost their legal basis. Fortunately, our fellow workers have not given up, and their actions and words have all followed the rules. Although there is no law to follow, there is ultimately no excuse to be made, and they can still stand upright in society and move forward in an orderly manner. However, for the sake of prudence, we should request the central government to provide legal provisions as a guideline for action. If it is approved and promulgated, there is no doubt that the future will see results that will surpass today's. Furthermore, how should the organization of postal workers' unions in various places be made sound? How should we support the establishment of postal workers' unions in places where they have not yet been established? How should we promote the realization of the National Postal Workers' Federation? How should we work together to liberate the national postal workers from their suffering? These are all things that the union and all our fellow workers should work together to achieve. This is the fourth meaning of sincere unity and consolidating the foundation of the union. In short, troubles and difficulties are multiplying, and a hundred affairs await to be addressed. It is impossible to achieve success overnight, nor can we expect it in a day. We only hope that our fellow workers, who have been accustomed to and familiar with each other, will be frank and sincere with each other and share our hardships, so that we can jointly achieve the success of enduring hardship. This is what the union fervently hopes for and is happy about. We sincerely inform you, and we hope that you will all encourage each other.</p>

<p>▲National Products Factories Enthusiastically Participate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products is making rapid progress in preparing for the Third National Products Exhibition in Zhabei. Since the announcement of registration, national products factories have enthusiastically participated and registered.

The registration will be closed as soon as the quota is filled, as the venue only has seventy rooms and cannot be expanded. The Zheng Zhengho Construction Factory has been hired to build the most economical and beautiful European-style cottages on the vacant lot of the Zhabei Charity Association. Xu Wei Jianruo is designing and supervising the construction day and night. It is estimated that it will be completed on the 13th.

In recent years, he encountered successive major famines. Mr. Huang coordinated with various philanthropists in Shanghai to raise relief funds and work tirelessly despite his illness. His sudden passing has caused widespread grief among the people of Jiangsu.</p>

<h3 id="e122">The National Crisis Relief Association and Others Convene a General Meeting of Representatives from All Walks of Life <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>▲ Discussing Ways for the People to Defend Themselves and Save the Nation</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Crisis Relief Association and over fifty other organizations, recognizing the lack of leadership in the new government, which has greatly impacted diplomacy, have initiated the convening of a general meeting of representatives from all walks of life. The meeting is scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 16th of this month at the YMCA on Sichuan Road to discuss ways for the people to defend themselves and save the nation. Yesterday, the meeting announcement was issued as follows: It is reported that the government's plan regarding Japan cannot be decided because the three Standing Committee members of the Central Political Council, Chiang, Wang, and Hu, are not in Nanjing. Since the fall of Jinzhou, the ferocity of the Japanese bandits has increased, and the situation within the country is becoming precarious, like the teeth being cold when the lips are gone. If the government still cannot decide on a policy towards Japan due to the lack of leadership, there will be no way to save the nation until the entire country is lost. At this critical moment, all Chinese people should strive to save themselves from extinction. Therefore, over fifty anti-Japanese and national salvation organizations from all walks of life have initiated the holding of a general meeting of representatives to discuss ways for the people to defend themselves and save the nation. We have always admired your association's patriotic enthusiasm and respectfully request that you immediately select two representatives and inform the National Crisis Relief Association at No. 201 Sichuan Road of their names and any counter-proposals before the meeting day (January 16th) so that admission tickets can be sent.</p>

<p>More than thirty lime boat owners, including Zhou Xinggen, Wang Rongbao, Jin Zirong, and Sun Rongkun, who transport lime to Shanghai, traditionally have a system where boats are unloaded based on the order of arrival, a custom approved and announced by the authorities. Recently, about thirty lime boats have arrived in Shanghai, waiting for the "Aeolus" to unload lime. However, the newly arrived boat owners, Qian Peirong and Qian Ating, relying on their strength, suddenly jumped ahead to unload lime, openly disrupting the custom. These boat owners believed that such disruption would mean that the lime boats docked in Shanghai would never be unloaded. They reported the matter to the police to stop it, but not only were they disobeyed, but they were also beaten. The police then took Qian Ating's son, Qian Xuelin, into custody, but he was released the next day. These boat owners believe that if this custom is disrupted, their livelihoods will be deprived. Yesterday, they jointly filed a complaint with the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Public Security Bureau, requesting strict punishment to limit disputes.</p>

<p>▲ Jewelry Broker Jin Yuancai Stabbed</p>
<p>▲ Perpetrators Sha Guifu and Jin Zhongliang</p>
<p>Jin Yuancai, a jewelry broker from Nanjing, residing at No. 7 Yanhai Road, Nanshi, entrusted Sha Guifu, the younger brother of his in-laws, with diamonds, jadeite jewelry, and other valuables worth over 5,000 yuan to sell a month ago. Sha then resold them to Jin Zhongliang, a fellow dealer. Jin Yuancai, needing to settle accounts, repeatedly asked Sha Guifu for the money, but Sha repeatedly prevaricated, claiming that the items had not been sold. Until about 6:00 PM the night before last, Sha, Jin Zhongliang, and a man named Tang went to Jin's house and invited him out, falsely claiming that the buyer lived on Yuyuan Road and asking him to go to collect the money. Jin believed them and went with them. Unexpectedly, when they reached their destination, Hengchang Lane on Yuyuan Road, Sha and the other two suddenly produced sharp knives and viciously attacked Jin, stabbing him in vital areas. Jin Yuancai was unable to resist, was injured, and fell to the ground unconscious. Fortunately, a Westerner driving by saw the perpetrators, Sha and others, committing the crime in the alley and immediately rushed to report to the patrolling police. The police rushed to the scene, arresting Sha and Jin. Tang, however, took the opportunity to escape. The Westerner took the injured Jin Yuancai to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. After surgery, he regained consciousness. Yesterday, Jin's condition was still very critical, with over a dozen stab wounds on his neck, back, arms, and other areas. The arrested perpetrators, Sha Guifu and Jin Zhongliang, will be sent to the Special District Court this morning for questioning. The injured Jin Yuancai is 24 years old and has been a jewelry broker for only one year.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Preparing to Establish a Consumer Cooperative for Public Utilities <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>▲ Initiated by the Zhejiang Private Electric Company</p>
<p>▲ The Same Industry Will Independently Order, Transport, and Sell</p>
<p>▲ Resist the Monopoly of Foreign Oil Companies</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Private Electricity Industry Association held a discussion meeting on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at A-11 Jiujiang Road to prepare for the establishment of the China Public Utilities Consumer Cooperative. Wang Gengbo of Changxing Changming Electric Company, Shen Zhiwan of Shengze Fuxin Electric Light Company, Zhang Ziyi of Jiashan Changyao Electric Light Company, Jiang Tiaosheng of Jinhua Electric Company, Zheng Yingqi of Yuanjiahu Huf Electric Light Rice Mill Company, Qian Zuliang of Xiashi Electric Light Company, Zhang Zuyin of Xiaoshan Yongan Electric Company, Shen Sifang of Wuxing Electric Company, Shen Sifang of Tongren Yuziji Electric Company, Wang Cunyong of Taihu Steamboat Company, Wang Cunyong of Tongyuan Steamboat Bureau, Xu Xingbai of Shangchuan Transportation Company, Zhang Youyi of Haiyan Electric Company, Zhang Ziqin of Chaiqiao Zhaoming Electric Company, Ye Chunwu of Shaoxing Daming Electric Company, Tong Zhanghua of Yiwu Electric Company, Zhang Laishou of Pinghu Steamboat Bureau, Han Yimin of Pinghu Minghua Electric Factory, and Sun Zhenyi of Chongde Yongming Electric Company, nineteen representatives in total, elected Han Yimin as the temporary chairman. Shen Siliang first reported on the progress of the project, stating that last fall, Mobil diesel and Asiatica salad oil jointly raised prices to 89.30 yuan, canceling the previously signed contracts with users within a time limit, which greatly affected the business prospects of oil engine users. At that time, Mr. Li Yanshi, in order to avoid manipulation and relieve users' losses, learned that Russian diesel was about to be sold and contacted Russian businessmen several times. However, the diesel had to be imported in quantities of 5,000 tons, which would involve huge costs. It was not appropriate to import rashly a month ago. Mr. Zhang Zuyin of Tianzhong Company mentioned that 500 tons of diesel could be ordered directly from the United States and transported to China, with a reserve capital of 100,000 yuan. Mr. Zhang could also find a way to raise half of the shares from outside and half from oil engine users. This would be easy to do. The colleagues were arranging to proceed, knowing that this would be detrimental to the business of Mobil and Asiatica. Therefore, they agreed in advance not to publicize it in order to facilitate progress. Unexpectedly, the news of this organization's cooperative society was still discovered by the other party, and in order to preempt it, they agreed to lower prices, initially intending to reduce them by 20 yuan, but eventually reducing them by 15 yuan, which was implemented on December 1, 20th year. The motive for the price reduction was this. However, the oil engine users enjoyed the benefit of cheap oil because of the organization of the cooperative. External investments were all aimed at high profits, and at this point, it was difficult to achieve the price, so they no longer intended to join. Therefore, the fundamental way to avoid oil company manipulation is for the same industry to cooperate and operate a purely cooperative society. It is hoped that after the cooperative society is established, oil companies will continue to lower prices. Today, oil machine colleagues from various places have come to Shanghai from afar to gather together. They must have a deep understanding of the meaning of the consumer cooperative. The issue that needs to be discussed now is the problems of fundraising, equipment, oil transportation, etc. Please give your valuable opinions. Next, Zhang Zuyin reported on the cost of diesel ordered directly from the United States, stating that the cost of delivery in the United States was 7.58 US dollars per ton, the freight from the United States to Shanghai was 4.50 US dollars per ton, the insurance premium was 0.026 US dollars per ton, and the domestic import tariff was 1.16 US dollars per ton, totaling 13.26 US dollars per ton, equivalent to 54 yuan in national currency, plus a temporary unloading fee of about 2.5% of the value of the goods, and a regular fee (excluding official interest) of 2.5%, equivalent to 2.70 yuan in national currency. The current market price of Mobil Asiatica Texaco is 74.30 yuan per ton, and the cost of the cooperative is about 62 yuan per ton after deducting all expenses. Therefore, each ton can have a net surplus of 12 yuan at the market price. Calculated at 500 tons, 6,000 yuan can be saved each month, and after 16 months, 100,000 yuan of capital can be raised. After the two reports, the chairman reported that Mr. Zhu Wenjun of Qiaoxie Changda Electric Factory sent two proposals: 1. To raise funds from all oil machine users in the province to establish a machine oil company to order directly from American merchants. 2. To investigate the monopoly situation of Shanghai oil companies to protest and negotiate. These two proposals are insightful, have a global perspective, and are worthy of reference for the cooperative. Mr. Shan Fengxiang of Quxian Electric Company sent a letter stating that oil companies are oppressing users and that measures should be taken to provide relief and be able to stop it, which would greatly benefit the industry. Mr. Cheng Jinhe of Meixi Guangming Electric Company sent a letter advocating gathering capital to organize a large-scale cooperative society to directly sign contracts with the United States to avoid manipulation. All the electrical materials needed for the electrical industry can also be made by the cooperative society itself or purchased and sold to supply our colleagues for purchase and use. In terms of capital, the number of tons of diesel used can be divided equally, or the amount can be limited for allocation. A draft business plan can be drawn up to solicit opinions from colleagues so that they can invest. After the report, the following resolutions were made: 1. The name is set as China Public Utilities Consumer Cooperative. 2. Li Yanshi, Ye Yangwu, Zhang Zuyin, Shen Zhiwan, Zhang Fengshou, Ji Yimin, Qian Zuliang, Zhi Bingyuan, Wang Soubo, Jiang Tiaosheng, Zhang Zhiyi, Shen Sifang, Wang Cunxian, Tao Liumen, Zhang Youyi were appointed as 15 promoters. 3. Li Yanshi, Zhang Zuyin, Ye Yangwu, Shen Sifang, Qian Zuliang, Wang Soubo, Zhi Bingyuan, Han Yimin, Zhang Fengshou, Zhang Minyi, Wang Cunxian were appointed as 11 preparatory members. 4. Ye Yangwu was appointed as the director of the preparatory committee, and Zhang Zuyin and Zhang Fengshou as the deputy directors. 5. The preparatory office was set up at Hanzhong Company, No. 25 Renji Road. 6. The first preparatory meeting will be held at Yizhixiang tomorrow night at 6:00 PM, convened by Ye Yangwu. Yesterday, the meeting was held for the first time at the Yizhixiang Vegetable Society. Zhang Zhiyi, Jiang Tiaosheng, Shen Sifang, Wang Soubo, Zhang Zuyin, Zhang Fengshou, and Ye Yangwu attended. The chairman was Ye Yangwu. The matters resolved were: 1. The capital was set at 100,000 yuan in national currency, and 50,000 yuan was raised, based on the amount of oil used, at 100 yuan per ton. 2. Jiang Tiaosheng, Shen Sifang, Tao Liumen, and Zhang Youyi were added as preparatory members, and all promoters were preparatory members. 3. Yang Bo'an was asked to draft the charter and subscription form. 4. Zhang Zuyin and Zhang Fengshou were asked to establish a budget. 5. The founding meeting will be held in February of the 21st year.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Declaration of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation on Guaranteeing Citizens' Housing Rights <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the Shanghai Citizens' Federation, in response to the continuous undermining of the housing rental rights of all residents by major landlords and property owners, established the Citizens' Housing Rights Protection Committee the day before yesterday to safeguard these rights. Yesterday, it issued a declaration stating: Recently, the housing rental rights of our Shanghai citizens have been continuously undermined by landlords and property owners, causing all citizens to face difficulties in both business and residence. This is the biggest obstacle to realizing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of "equalization of land rights" to benefit residential housing. The legislation of the National Government follows Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, so Article 450, Section 2 of the Civil Code clearly stipulates that "[customs that are beneficial to the lessee shall be followed]." In other words, customs that are not beneficial to the lessee shall not be adopted. How important is the protection of the interests of water renters, that is, "the weak people"? Shanghai landlords and property owners have recently regarded real estate as an object of speculation, ignoring the reality of real estate investment consolidation, and using means such as rent increases and forced evictions to seek profit at the expense of others. A small number of financiers have also fueled the flames, engaging in real estate mortgage transactions, causing the customs that are beneficial to the lessee, such as landlords not being able to ask tenants to move unless (1) tenants are in arrears for more than one month without reason or (2) the houses are dilapidated and must be rebuilt, to be undermined by landlords and property owners and no longer exist. The above facts are clearly contrary to the law, reason, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy. The association, as a group of citizens, fulfills its responsibility to seek the welfare of citizens, and therefore, it has established the Citizens' Housing Rights Protection Committee to ensure that the habits that should be followed according to law are not shaken and that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of equalizing land rights to benefit residential housing can be established. We are not afraid of any difficulties. This is our declaration. Shanghai Citizens' Federation.</p>

<p>▲ The Bullet in the Body Is Missing</p>
<p>Zhang Qingxiang of Huayuan Shiqiao, Pudong, colluded with his maternal uncle to kill his elder brother Guoxiang and second brother Yuxiang in an attempt to monopolize the inheritance. However, Guoxiang was injured but not killed, while Yuxiang died on the spot. After the case was accepted by the District Court, Prosecutor Shen Zhaoming, who was in charge of the case, spared no effort to investigate various evidences, and the facts were already clear. However, because the bullet that injured Guoxiang had not yet been removed, Guoxiang was summoned to the case the day before yesterday and went to the orthopedic hospital together to examine the bullet embedded in the neck bone using X-rays. However, inexplicably, after examining the whole body, the bullet was gone. It was thought that it had entered the abdomen. However, when Guoxiang was treated at Baolong Hospital at that time, the hospital took two X-ray photos, one from the side, which was very clear, and one from the front, which only showed the head of the bullet. However, due to the photographic relationship, his face, neck, and bones were completely enlarged, so that the bullet was also larger than its original shape, as if it was fired from a six-inch pistol. The prosecutor is now ordering the forensic doctor to shrink and calculate the shape of the bullet to determine what the original shape was and to consider where the bullet in Guoxiang's body is embedded in order to process the case.</p>

<p>Wu Linkun, a famous lawyer in Shanghai, is from Ganpu, Haiyan, Zhejiang. On December 24th of last year, his hometown was attacked by fierce bandits with over 200 people, each carrying guns, knives, and other weapons. Every household was looted, and no residents were spared. The bandits were not satisfied and kidnapped 39 wealthy gentry members before leaving. The next day, 16 people were released, but the whereabouts of the remaining 23 are still unknown. The bandits have not sent letters to the victims to demand ransom. It is reported that Lawyer Wu's elderly father, Mr. Yanqing, was also among those kidnapped. This old man is over 60 years old and is usually very enthusiastic about local public welfare. He especially enjoys helping poor villagers. His family is not wealthy. When the bandits were looting, he was lying in bed, thinking that he was not a wealthy household and would not be noticed, so he did not avoid them. Unexpectedly, he was also kidnapped. After Lawyer Wu heard the news, he tried to rescue him, but he did not know his whereabouts and could not start. Now he is only hoping that his father will send news soon and tell him his residence so that he can proceed with everything.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Extortion Case Involving Chinese Police <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Case Cannot Be Established</p>
<p>▲ The Magistrate Reprimanded and Released Them in Court</p>
<p>Sun Zhibing and Shao Tongshun, from Funing, went to No. 33 Linqing Road around 7:00 AM on the 7th of this month to borrow silver dollars from their fellow villager Lu Yongxiang. They quarreled because they were unsuccessful. Lu, seeing that they were about to attack him, fearing that he would suffer a loss, pretended to agree and promised to provide them the next morning. When Sun and Shao went to collect the money, Lu secretly reported to the Yangshupu Police Station, saying that some hooligans were extorting 30 silver dollars from him and pointing out a Chinese policeman, Sheng Lianjia, No. 1969, who was using a pistol to threaten and help with the extortion. The head of the patrol immediately sent Chinese detectives Fei Ruiqing and Liu Changgen to arrest Sun and Shao and bring them to the police station. The head of the patrol asked Lu Yongxiang again whether Chinese policeman No. 1969 was actually present, and Lu claimed that he had mistakenly pointed him out. The detectives also found that the facts were false reports and false accusations of extortion. Lu and Sun Shao were friends for many years. At that time, he only borrowed three silver dollars from them and detained them. The day before yesterday, they were sent to the First Special Court, Court One. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the previous situation, followed by Chinese policeman No. 1969, who claimed that he saw them arguing and feared that a reactionary incident would occur. He then asked about the dispute over borrowing three silver dollars, so he did not intervene. Unexpectedly, Lu falsely accused him of helping with the extortion at the police station. When questioned, Sun and Shao confessed that they were close friends with Lu Yongxiang. Previously, they requested only three yuan from him, but he refused and secretly reported them to the police station, accusing them of extortion. Lu Yongxiang confessed that he was temporarily confused and afraid of being beaten by them, so he took this action. Regarding the Chinese policeman No. 1969, he did not point out that he helped with the extortion at the police station. Please understand. After Judge Xiao Xiefen verified the confessions, because the case could not be established, he released them all together.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Jun boat Jinxiangtai, loaded with gravel from Ningbo to Shanghai, after selling it, sailed out of the port on the morning of the day before yesterday. At about 5:00 AM, when it arrived at the Pujiang River of the Yangshupu Electric Factory, a Changsha steamboat was sailing out of the port behind the Jun boat. Suddenly, it turned its rudder and turned its head, causing the stern of the Jun boat to be damaged, resulting in huge losses. The owner, Yin Ayue, arrived in Song yesterday and reported the incident to the Penglai Public Office, submitting a report to the Ship Administration Office of the Customs, requesting compensation from the Changsha Steamboat Company for the losses.</p>

<p>▲ The Helmsman Lin Ruida Is Suspected</p>
<p>When the China Merchants Bureau's Xinming Steamboat was in Tanggu, the Tianjin Customs found opium in the old master's room. Fortunately, the amount was not large, so a fine of 1,000 taels of silver was imposed on the Xinming before it was allowed to return. Later, the shipowners thoroughly investigated the source of the opium, and the crew unanimously pointed to the helmsman, Lin Ruida, from Ningbo, as the one who brought it. Therefore, when the ship arrived in Shanghai, Lin was sent to the First Branch of the Third District and escorted to the District Court to be investigated and to recover the 1,000 taels fine.</p>

<p>▲ The Ship Still Sailed Out as Usual Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, Da Da Steamboat Company submitted a report to the Navigation Administration Bureau stating that on January 9th, when the people's Dahe Steamboat was docked at the wharf, preparing to sail out of the port, at 10:10 PM, when passengers were boarding, an unknown passenger privately carried a hemp bag filled with small firecrackers and placed it on the stone head of the rear deck of the second-class cabin. The ship did not know what was stored in it beforehand. Passengers passing by accidentally touched the bag, causing a loud explosion with thick smoke. People on the ship heard the sound and were disturbed, and the order was disrupted. Some people were so anxious that they jumped into the water and were rescued. The crew prepared to provide rescue and tried to comfort them. At the same time, the hemp bag was thrown into the river, and two unthrown firecrackers with explosives were found. At that time, the company was still worried that other passengers might have privately carried the same dangerous explosive materials, so it immediately reported to the Water Patrol Team to send a team on board for a thorough search. As a result, two other passengers were found, one privately carrying four large boxes of matches and the other privately carrying a string of firecrackers, who were detained by the team. Dahe sailed out of the port as usual. The company has no right to inspect and ban passengers from privately carrying dangerous goods. The company has suffered repeated disasters and is extremely painful. In view of the past, it is even more afraid of the future. These types of incidents endanger the lives and property of passengers and are truly impossible to prevent. The bureau in charge of navigation administration must take proper measures to handle the aftermath well without waiting for the company to nag. The Dahe Steamboat Company hereby submits a report on the situation of the firecracker explosion and submits a firecracker with explosives, requesting the bureau to review and approve it.</p>

<p>The Wusong Ship Registration Office of the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau has been established. Its office is located next to the Seaport Quarantine Station in the eastern section of Wai Ma Lu. The director, Mr. Qin, and the other staff members have already begun ship registration work. Therefore, many owners of sand fishing sailboats have been going to register in recent days.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Public Works Department Sets One-Way Traffic on Jiangxi Road <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department said that the one-way traffic regulations on Jiangxi Road between Suzhou Road and Beijing Road, going from north to south, have been tried for three months and have been made permanent on the recommendation of the Chief of Police and the Traffic Director. From the perspective of police and traffic conditions, the one-way method has been successful. However, at the beginning of the reform, people protested, which was expected. But once they get used to the one-way traffic, all difficulties will disappear. This method prevents obstruction when loading and unloading goods and materials at warehouses and other places on that section of the road. The one-way traffic method is the same as "no right turn." This may be somewhat inconvenient for those who have business relations in the area, but in narrow roads and intersections, as the number of vehicles and markets increases, for the benefit of the public, it is necessary to make traffic safer and more advanced.</p>

<p>▲ Both Victims Injured</p>
<p>Wang Chunquan, a farmer living in Xinqiao, Hongqiao Town, west of Shanghai, was returning home from the town at about 10 o'clock the night before last. Just as he reached his gate and was about to open it, two robbers suddenly appeared behind him, seized him, and robbed him of over forty yuan of membership fees and a cotton robe. Wang resisted slightly, and the robbers struck him on the head with a stick, causing his face to bleed profusely. He fell to the ground, and only dared to call for help after the robbers left. Neighbors heard his cries and came to his aid, helping him back home and bandaging his wounds. Furthermore, Qin Yongchang, a carpenter from Xinqiao, west of Hongqiao Town, was returning home from drinking at a relative's house in Qibao Town at about 8 o'clock the night before last. When he passed by Gujiatang, three people suddenly appeared and grabbed Qin's hands, robbing him of a gold ring and twelve yuan in cash, and stripping off his camel-hair silk robe. When Qin argued with them, the robbers stabbed him in the leg with a knife, and he fell to the ground. He lay there until dawn, when a passerby noticed him and sent him home. It is said that his injuries are very serious and his life is in danger.</p>

<p>▲ It Was Originally the Client's Intention</p>
<p>Lawyer Liu Mingdu acted as agent for Xu Xianglin in a case against his wife, Xu Shenshi, regarding national affairs. A settlement was reached in the conciliation court of the Shanghai District Court, with Xu paying monthly living expenses. Xu Shenshi requested enforcement, and the execution court judge, He Yuliu, issued a summons for arrest. Lawyer Liu filed a protest, and was also dissatisfied during the questioning. As a result, the judge sent Lawyer Liu to the prosecutor's office for investigation. It is now learned that Lawyer Liu was allowed to return home after being investigated by Prosecutor Zhao at 4 PM on that day. He was summoned again the morning before, and Prosecutor Zhao determined that the matter was the client's intention, and again allowed Lawyer Liu to return home, while detaining the client, Xu Xianglin. Lawyer Liu then, last Sunday, attached a letter to the Shanghai Lawyers' Association's Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committee, requesting a discussion of relief methods, and requesting that the client, Xu Xianglin, be released on bail pending trial.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Jiangsu National Crisis Relief Association's Opinion on Economic Sanctions Against Japan <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>▲ Based on Legal Facts</p>
<p>▲ Ten Methods Proposed</p>
<p>▲ Hoping for National Implementation</p>
<p>This time, Japan is using its violence to invade our Eastern Provinces, and all our people are filled with indignation and heartache, and are urgently seeking to resist. The most effective method is: 1. Armed resistance, 2. Economic sanctions. The former belongs to the power and ability of the government, and our national youth and people have repeatedly petitioned the authorities. The latter belongs to the inherent power and ability of the people. The National Anti-Japanese Salvation Associations have worked hard and struggled for three months. Now, this association is reiterating this to make it clear to all our people that economic sanctions are more effective than armed resistance, that this power is in our hands, and that it is practical. We hope that from now on, we will further strengthen our strength, extend our time, and persevere to the end. The possible points in law and fact are explained separately below: 1) Legal Possibilities. The implementation of economic sanctions by the National Anti-Japanese Salvation Associations can be said to be irreversible. However, if there is no legal basis, it will be difficult to maintain it for a long time. In terms of law, the applicable laws include international law and domestic law. The effect of international law is stronger than that of domestic law. That is, international law has the effect of overriding domestic law. When domestic law conflicts with international law, international law is still effective. The Covenant of the League of Nations is a type of international law, and all member states have an obligation to abide by it. This is the effect of the Covenant. Article 12 states that if a dispute arises between members of the League that is likely to lead to a rupture, the matter shall be submitted to arbitration or examined by the Executive Council. In any event, no war shall be waged until three months after the award of the arbitrators or the report of the Executive Council. Article 13 states that if a dispute arises between members of the League that is considered suitable for arbitration and cannot be satisfactorily resolved through diplomatic channels, the issue shall be submitted entirely to arbitration. Article 16 states that if a member of the League disregards the provisions of Articles 12 and 13 of this Covenant and engages in war, then, according to this fact, it shall be immediately regarded as an act of war against all other members of the League. Other members are responsible for immediately severing all commercial and financial relations with it, prohibiting its people from engaging in various interactions with the people of the Covenant-breaking country, and preventing the people of any other country, whether members of the League or not, from engaging in financial, commercial, or personal interactions with the people of that country. In this situation, the Executive Council shall be responsible for making recommendations to the governments concerned, so that the members of the League can use their land, sea, and air forces to form an army to maintain the implementation of the Covenant. The so-called commercial relations refer to buying, selling, and transportation. Financial relations refer to lending. Personal interactions refer to employment, delegation, contracting, etc. In short, it is economic sanctions. This sanction is not only done by oneself, but also should be done by the people, and can also be done by the people of other countries. But if the violating country engages in war against a member, all other members should immediately assume the obligation of economic sanctions. Then, the people of the country who are harmed by the war can adopt economic sanctions, which is self-evident. This is the legal basis.</p>
<p>2) Factual Possibilities. From the perspective of vendors, those with a little patriotic conscience will definitely not willingly buy Japanese goods. If they mistakenly buy Japanese goods, they will not lose all their value due to prolonged detention and sealing. Moreover, in commercial practice, large quantities of Japanese goods have often been mortgaged in advance. Prolonged sealing will only increase interest. In commerce, losses due to sluggish sales and discounts are also common. Now, in the face of national crisis, suffering this slight loss is not unreasonable. If they deliberately sell Japanese goods for the sake of taking risks and making profits, resulting in losses, they can also be given a small punishment and a big lesson, which is in line with the political principle of sacrificing the interests of a few for the sake of the interests of the majority. This is one possibility. From the perspective of consumers, Japanese goods are luxury goods, and should be prohibited in this time of national crisis and poverty. Japanese goods are necessities, and there is no substitute for domestic goods. There are many substitutes for foreign goods. Moreover, there are four major desires in life, and only food is indispensable. There is no need to rely on Japanese goods. Other deficiencies do not hinder life. This is the second possibility. In terms of methods of resistance, everyone can do it. It is not like armed resistance, which requires special training and special weapons. The patriotic sentiments of our people are surging. If we can get enthusiastic patriots to give advice and guidance at all times using the following methods, even if it is extended from today to one, two, or three years, it will not be as difficult as Gandhi in India. Gandhi was able to advocate non-violent resistance to this extent under the iron heel of the British. Moreover, our country has not been destroyed. Some provinces still have the freedom to resist Japan, and there is the Covenant of the League of Nations as a legal basis. No official loves the country more than I do. It will not be too oppressive. Even now, it is not too late to make amends. 1. All people in the country, regardless of their position, must swear not to buy Japanese goods, not to take Japanese ships, not to interact with Japanese people, not to work for Japanese people, and not to employ Japanese people. 2. All teachers and students in the country's schools, in addition to swearing not to buy Japanese goods themselves, must also do their best to study and publicize and advise the people of families and various social groups not to buy Japanese goods, and to contact various sectors to organize patriotic national salvation groups to investigate Japanese goods and effectively resist them. 3. All employees of various stores in the country, regardless of what kind of goods they sell, must swear not to buy or sell Japanese goods. If there are a few unscrupulous merchants who secretly import Japanese goods and sell them privately, they must report the facts to the patriotic national salvation groups and severely punish them as a warning to others. 4. All railway workers, ship workers, dock workers, truck workers, and all other transportation workers in the country, in addition to not buying Japanese goods, must swear to stop transporting Japanese goods. 5. Women across the country, when choosing daily necessities for their families, must swear not to buy Japanese goods, and must pay extra attention when shopping, and not buy Japanese goods that impersonate domestic goods or Western goods. 6. The financial sector across the country, regardless of banks, money houses, or silver firms, must swear to sever all ties with Japanese people, and sever all ties with unscrupulous merchants who secretly import Japanese goods and sell them privately. 7. All goods sold by exporters across the country to foreigners must state that they must not be resold to Japanese people. If it is found that the goods have been resold to Japanese people, they must be warned and efforts must be made to stop it. 8. Importers across the country, when ordering goods from foreign merchants, must state that they must not impersonate them with Japanese goods, and must not ship them on Japanese ships. If the above situation is found, efforts should be made to resist it. 9. Members of the Tianjin Lawyers' Association across the country must share the responsibility of defending lawsuits related to economic sanctions against Japan, and must not defend or handle negotiations for unscrupulous merchants who have been sanctioned by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, in accordance with the resolution of the Shanghai Lawyers' Association. 10. Administrative officials and judges in the country must base their decisions on the patriotic conscience of the people and implement the protection of patriotic people from being deceived by unscrupulous merchants who buy and sell Japanese goods, in accordance with the spirit of Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The economic relationship between Japan and our country is very close. The previous eight boycotts of Japanese goods were laughed at by Japan for their five-minute heat. This time, Japan dared to risk the disapproval of the world and occupy our Northeast with force, also because our people's resistance to Japanese goods only has a five-minute heat and is not enough to be feared. If our people can be firm and persistent, then Japan's economy will inevitably develop five flaws. This is the only way to sanction Japan. May our people work together.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Four Major Political Reforms <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Break. Down. Party. Bias. Gather. Talent.</p>
<p>Open. Up. Public. Administration. Implement. People's. Constitution.</p>
<p>Implement. Conscription. End. Recruitment.</p>
<p>Promote. Universal. Education. Encourage. Learning.</p>
<p>Zhang Ke Gong</p>
<p>The foreign crisis is urgent. The Eastern Provinces have fallen, and the whole country is shocked. Internally, warlords are playing with soldiers, bad governance is emerging daily, and the Communist Party is rampant with bandits everywhere. The floods in 18 provinces last year were rare in Chinese and foreign history. People are not living, and the country is on the verge of ruin. Talented people concerned about the times have risen up to save themselves, knowing that to resist foreign aggression, we must first pacify the country; to pacify the country, we must first eliminate factions and engage in political reform together. However, with sores all over, where to start? Grasping the key lies in being appropriate. Now, based on what I have seen and heard, I will briefly offer my foolish opinions: 1. Break down party boundaries and gather talent. The party occupies an absolutely small minority of the entire population, and not all talented people belong to the party. Observing under the past party rule, there is a lack of talent within the party, and opportunism and competition are rampant, and politics is deteriorating daily, which easily leads to the autocracy of those in power, which leads to the disintegration of the party. Outside the party, even if there are people of superior intelligence and talent, they are unable to serve because of the constraints of the situation. Thus, the party gradually becomes a special class to the people, and the people gradually develop fear, jealousy, and hatred towards the party, and gradually generate the heart to suppress and abandon it. At its extreme, it will inevitably evolve into a special class struggle of the entire nation, or some may criticize it as a feudal system of intrigue, which, although an overstatement, is not without reason. 2. Open up public administration and implement the people's constitution. Once party boundaries are broken down, a people's constitution should be implemented. In this transitional era, the minimum requirement is that the members of the legislative and supervisory chambers must be thoroughly elected. All measures to raise public debt, try new taxes, and increase the burden on the people must be approved by the legislature, and their use, as well as all income and expenditure of the state finances, should be strictly reviewed by the supervisory chamber. The Examination Yuan is responsible for selecting talents, which is of great importance to the future of the country. It should be organized by the national academic community, and the government should select the best candidates for appointment. The above three chambers are all regularly convened institutions and do not need to be established on a permanent basis to save expenses and facilitate execution. The lower-level party departments in various places should be resolutely abolished in the shortest possible time and replaced by people's autonomous organizations. 3. Implement conscription and end recruitment.</p>
<p>Conscription is a necessary element of democratic politics. There can be no master who has no strength to control his servants. This is the reason for all the internal wars since the Republic of China, the violation of popular will, and the military dictatorship. At this time of the rampant Japanese and the poisoning of the Communist bandits, it is even more urgent. All active soldiers should be transferred to the border to recover lost territory. When the people's military strength is gradually established, they should be gradually demobilized and returned to the fields. Those who have contributed to defending against foreign aggression and have outstanding military achievements should be given appropriate arrangements. The current major problems of the country and the suffering of the people are the intrusion of Japanese slaves, the harassment of the Red Party, and the frequent cyclical internal wars. These three cannot be eradicated without implementing conscription. 4. Promote universal education and encourage learning. Promoting universal compulsory education is also a necessary condition for democratic politics. Otherwise, only the rich can enter school, and the majority of the poor will remain ignorant like deer and pigs, and will not know what national politics is. Those who are now in charge of the country only know how to implement tutelage and do not plan to promote universal compulsory education. I am afraid that their tutelage will have no end. As for researching academic matters and writing books, they should be vigorously encouraged, and there should be no restrictions that hinder the progress of evolution. Even if there are one or two who do not comply with the law, in my opinion, if there is no factual manifestation, they should only be corrected, and not immediately convicted. The above is just a rough outline. At first glance, it seems distant and difficult to achieve immediate results. However, to recover the scattered hearts of the people, eliminate the hidden dangers everywhere, correct the source, and gradually achieve governance, there is no other shortcut to be found. In addition, promoting morality to rectify the people's will and revitalizing industries to enrich the people's livelihood are also urgent tasks that cannot be delayed. Real industries owned by the people should be thoroughly protected. Due to limited space, I will not list them separately. (Ding) (Shift Reward for Assistance)</p>

<h3 id="e153">Miscellaneous Notes on Sino-Japanese Military Strength <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>There is a Mr. Sun in Jinshan. Formerly a professor at Feng Yong University, he later studied military affairs at the Japanese Military Academy. Recently, due to the national crisis, he returned to China. I heard him talk about the state of Sino-Japanese military strength, which is summarized as follows. Japanese men, upon reaching the age of twenty-two, are immediately enlisted in the military and undergo military training for a period of two years. After discharge, they become reservists. In the event of a national emergency, they are required to be mobilized for service upon the order of the military. However, this obligation only lasts until the age of forty-one, after which they are no longer obligated to participate in combat. Currently, the number of active Japanese military personnel, combined with these reservists aged twenty-four to forty, totals no more than three million. This constitutes their main force, a modest number not to be feared.</p>
<p>Japan is extremely well-stocked with military equipment. The bullets used for target practice by cadets at the military academy are all marked with the year "Taisho [Emperor] such-and-such." I have not seen any marked with "Showa [Emperor]". The bullets seized from the Japanese bandits who recently caused trouble in Tianjin were also manufactured in the fifth year of the Taisho Era. Their abundant stockpiles are thus evident. Although their country has seen little war and does not require such reserves, the fact that they maintain them reveals their ambition.</p>
<p>We Chinese people flee at the mere rumor of the Japanese army, as if the Japanese army were as fearsome as tigers. In reality, their skills are quite ordinary. Their physical strength is not as great as rumored, and their intelligence is not superior to ours, and may even be inferior. Those who go to study at the military academy must first undergo six months of practical training in the Japanese army. In terms of physical comparison, they are similar to us. In terms of teaching, the Japanese have not yet understood it, while we are already familiar with it. During the May 3rd Jinan Incident, according to a certain commander of ours in Jinan, the Japanese army was actually a paper tiger. Their tactics were so poor that it was evident upon contact. We merely tremble at their reputation and change color at the mention of war.</p>
<p>There are three supreme military and political organizations in Japan: the Ministry of the Army, the General Staff Headquarters, and the Naval General Staff. The Ministry of the Army is responsible for administrative matters.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Ma Yongzhen and Yellow Tooth Beard <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Zi</p>
<p>Chinese boxing has traditionally been divided into the Shaolin and Wudang schools. Shaolin emphasizes strength, while Wudang emphasizes flexibility. Most martial arts performers in the Jianghu [martial arts community] start with Shaolin. Ma Yongzhen, who lived forty years ago, was a master of Shaolin. I was fortunate enough to see him as a child. Ma performed in Shanghai on North Shimen Road (i.e., North Fujian Road), with a large yellow banner that loudly proclaimed: "Feet Stomp the Yellow River, Sweep Across the Four Seas; Fists Strike Both Northern and Southern Capitals," to demonstrate his invincibility. Yellow Tooth Beard, a French police detective, was also a master of Western boxing. He brought an interpreter to Ma, wishing to test his skills. Ma smiled and refused. Yellow Beard suspected that Ma was afraid and insisted on a match. Ma explained the difference between Chinese and Western boxing, stating that if he made a mistake, it could cause trouble for which he would not be responsible. The interpreter relayed this to Yellow Beard, who stubbornly refused to accept. Ma said, "Let's just try it. How about we step on roof tiles and hook our index fingers to test our strength?" Yellow Beard agreed. They proceeded to compare strength in this manner. As soon as they hooked fingers, all the tiles under Yellow Beard's feet shattered. His face turned red, and sweat poured down his forehead. The onlookers knew that Ma was deliberately yielding, while Yellow Beard was in an embarrassing situation. At the time, there was a gatekeeper named Jia at the Shilu Tianxian Theater. He was from Shandong, seven feet tall, with fists as big as buckets. He was an experienced martial artist with great strength. Hearing of Ma's arrogance, he wanted to embarrass him. He waited by Ma's side for several days. One day, he caught a glimpse of Ma practicing punches with his disciples. He took a string of one hundred cash coins from his pocket and threw it at Ma from a distance. Ma sensed a wind behind his head and dodged it. It hit a disciple behind his ear, causing a slight cut. Ma calmly said, "A true hero never resorts to sneak attacks. If there is a strong man, why doesn't he come forward for a contest?" He ordered his disciple to buy Western paper and held a corner of the paper, standing ten steps away. Ma announced to the crowd, "My hard kung fu has reached its peak. I can defeat him with internal strength. Watch my small skill." He then pointed a finger at the paper from a distance. The paper suddenly pierced through. The spectators applauded, and tossed money rained down. Jia, witnessing this, knew he was no match and quietly retreated. I was only twelve years old at the time, but I still remember the scene vividly. The General Staff Headquarters is in charge of military command, etc. The dispatch of troops must be ordered by the Naval General Staff. The General Staff Headquarters and the Naval General Staff are both directly under the Emperor and not subject to the control of the Cabinet.</p>
<p>According to a certain military expert, the total number of soldiers in our country is actually more than 2.2 million. As for guns, there are not enough to equip them, as not every soldier gets a gun. There are no stored-up bullets, they are all consumed in internal wars. On average, each soldier is given at most two hundred bullets. If a general attack is launched, they will be used up in a single day, and everyone will sigh at the emptiness. If we declare war on Japan, we should be able to cope with their active military personnel. However, Japan has reservists aged twenty-four to forty, so we must also urgently train militia as a backup. A shortage of bullets is not to be feared, but by leading them ashore for hand-to-hand fighting, we can surely destroy them. According to what I have heard, there is something Mr. Sun does not know. In the northern countryside of our country, nineteen out of ten families have guns and corresponding bullets. I heard that in Haizhou alone, there are 50,000 guns. Considering all of the North, there should be no fewer than several million guns. The method they use to store guns is to pour candle wax into the gaps of the gun and apply oil to the outside, making it like a wax gun. Buried underground, it will not rust or decay for many years. In the event of an emergency, they can be taken out, and the oil removed. Therefore, I say that today's militia should be quickly gathered in the North. They have guns, bullets, and training. A strong army can be assembled in an instant.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Anecdotes of Xu Jingwo <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Xu Jingwo was a bookseller who lived in Shanghai and set up a book stall under the Shengping Tea House on Fuzhou Road. At that time, Zhang Taiyan from Yuhang and Zou Weidan from Sichuan advocated anti-Qing sentiment, and revolution was at its height. However, sellers were often targeted by detectives and did not dare to display such books. Xu alone gathered them all without leaving any out, and he was content. Therefore, every day after the lamps were lit, a crowd stood around him. Those who were fascinated by these kinds of books all competed to buy them, and his business was uniquely prosperous.</p>
<p>Xu spoke with a Ningbo accent and wore Western clothes, but he was quite witty and always made people laugh. His background was actually unknown. He had two daughters. At that time, it was fashionable in the female world to wear short jackets and long skirts with only sleeves, but he had them cut their hair short, letting it fall loosely over their shoulders, just like the fashionable women of today. He was the first to start the trend. My deceased friend Wang Zhiheng and I often liked to talk with him. One day, a Japanese man came, who was also familiar with him. Xu pointed at him and said, "[Those who worry about the present only know to guard against Russia. Comparing them to the tigers and wolves of the Qin Dynasty, they do not know that in twenty years they will have to guard against these rats even more]." Those who heard this secretly laughed, and the Japanese man also looked ashamed. To this day, I remember it and admire Xu's foresight, lamenting that I cannot reach it.</p>
<p>Later, he was reported by those who were jealous. Jiang Governor Duan Fang urgently wanted to arrest him. Shanghai detective Mi Zhanyuan took Xu to the provincial capital for interrogation, which almost cost him his life. Someone who knew the situation said that Xu was nicknamed "Wild Chicken King" and was a rogue. What revolution would he be involved in? Therefore, he was released. It turned out that Shanghai's small newspapers, such as "Youxi Caifeng" and "Tongwen", were competing to open flower lists, and Xu, to avoid arrest, had also been a teacher of a courtesan. Who would have thought that this leisurely activity in the realm of pleasure was also a way to protect himself wisely? After Zou Weidan died of illness, no one dared to bury him. Liu San from Minhang used three acres of his good land for the burial, and Xu managed the matter. His noble righteousness was like this. Today, few can speak of it, so I have recounted it.</p>

<p>▲ The man with the longest hair and beard in the world is an Indian man named Ari Xiong from the Kalea people. He is currently fifty-five years old, and his beard is sixty-eight inches long, hanging down to the ground.

<h3 id="e157">A Word from Old Man Ma Xiangbo, Ninety-Three Years Old <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>In the Republic of China, in Beijing, there was a publication called "Wansong Yeren Yan Shanlu." The opening chapter said, "In recent years, people's hearts have been treacherous, and customs have been corrupted to an extreme. All those mature gentlemen and upright people cannot help but be saddened by what they see and want to come up with all sorts of ways to maintain order. Although the methods are different, they are all a kind of painful effort to save the world. However, the most common opinion among them is that a country cannot be established without religion. When asked why it cannot be established, they say that religion has a kind of power to restrain people's hearts and unite groups. When asked how it has this power, they say it is because religion has superstition. But superstition is unacceptable. For example, popular morality books that advise people to do good actually have stories about saving ants resulting in passing the imperial examination as Number One Scholar, and burying snakes resulting in the honor of being a prime minister. Think about it carefully, the value of a Number One Scholar is just a few ants exchanged, and the honor of a prime minister is obtained just because of a snake. Furthermore, Qin Hui and Yan Song were both Number One Scholars and prime ministers. What good deeds did they do to accumulate that karma? Therefore, Zhao Yun Song has a poem that says, 'Scholars of the world like to criticize Buddhism, wanting to exhaust its essence. I only speak of its rudiments, which are clearly and easily understood. Its teachings strictly prohibit killing, so life can flourish. But it cuts off the desires of men and women, not allowing humans to be born. This will cause the universe to be filled with animals and devoid of people. Is this the principle of creation? Its poison surpasses the pit of Qin. Try to use a long tongue to argue, what will you say?' Some say that if there is no reincarnation and karma, would it not discourage gentlemen from doing good and encourage villains to do evil? Furthermore, in ancient times, the lifespan of Yan Hui was short, while the lifespan of the bandit Zhi was long. The principle of delivering blessings and punishments is inevitably overturned. How can this comfort people's hearts and calm their anger?' I say that these principles are not difficult to explain. For example, ancient people praised King Wen's great virtue, even saying things like 'Shining in Heaven, at God's side.' If Jie and Zhou were extremely evil, could they be placed in the same rank as King Wen? Surely not. If not, then they must be in the opposite position. At the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, there was a Wei Shuzi who was also a famous figure in the Confucian world. He wrote four essays on the topic of Hell, although they were not entirely clear, they still had some meaning. His main point was that in the world, rewards and punishments are chaotic, and good and evil are mixed. People who are extremely evil and heavily sinful, or who die of old age, like the traitors Cao Cao and Qin Hui, and the lewd tyrants Yang Guang and Wanyan Liang, the state's punishment only goes as far as dismemberment. Those who are extremely cruel do not fear death. What should be done about them? Furthermore, they often do not suffer worldly punishment. Therefore, there must be a Hell to make them wish for death but not be able to obtain it, tossing and turning among knives, saws, and cauldrons for millions of years without end. Bribes and pleas are useless. Filial sons and kind grandsons cannot substitute. Evil retribution falls upon their own bodies and does not affect others. Alas, this is the ultimate! Furthermore, he said, 'I firmly believe that Hell is necessary as a matter of principle, while reciting scriptures and worshiping Buddha to eliminate disasters and expiate sins is impossible as a matter of principle. If worshiping Buddha could eliminate sins, then powerful families could be as evil as they pleased, but only need to spend one-tenth of their wealth to avoid punishment. Then Buddha would be an evil rascal and crafty gentry who indulged in sentiment and pleas. Buddha should be sitting in the chief seat in Hell!' Therefore, the two words 'superstition' cannot save the world. Guo Jun Futing is also an upright person who wants to maintain the world and people's hearts. He plans to re-engrave the Yin Zhi Wen with illustrations to awaken the world. The good thing about his book is that it has illustrations. Even those who cannot read can see it and warn themselves." Therefore, the old man happily quoted the words of Yeren to refuse his request.</p>

<p>▲ The Italian Prime Minister forbids the capture of swallows. Every year, tens of thousands of swallows migrate from England to Africa. This time, when they flew through Italy, Vienna was experiencing heavy snow and severe cold. Tens of thousands of these swallows froze to death. When the people of Vienna saw this, they felt pity and loaded three motorized airplanes from Venice to rush to their rescue. It is said that thousands of people went to the rescue. All the swallows scattered in the gaps of the eaves of the Vienna houses were captured and placed in buckets and fed insects. In this way, the airplanes transported up to 40,000 swallows to Venice every day. If the weather does not clear up, they may be transported to Naples. Therefore, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, upon hearing the news, immediately ordered a ban on capture. However, Italy has a great fondness for swallows and is secretly capturing and raising them.</p>

<p>— Seeking Happiness, Master of Qizhai</p>
<p>Chapter One: An Unrivaled Courtesan Lives in Solitude, Cherishing Her Beautiful Family; A Student in a Foreign Land Wanders, Forging a Strange Romance. At first, I thought that anyone, regardless of gender, could strive to improve and seek advancement. Given the vastness of the world and the abundance of opportunities, there was no need to worry about not finding a path to develop and manage. However, when I seriously tried to get started, I was dazzled and confused by the myriad possibilities. I couldn't find a suitable place to start. If I were to lightly believe what people said and act rashly, it would seem inappropriate. I couldn't make up my mind and hesitated for some days, and I still hadn't accomplished anything. Gradually, I began to focus on finding a lover. In today's world, it is more legitimate for men to come forward and do things. I would find an honest and useful young man, and we would combine forces. I would strategize and help him embark on the path to success. This would be similar to doing it myself. Moreover, as a lonely, unmarried woman, I had tasted the flavor of loneliness and felt confused in my heart. I felt that everything was too monotonous and that life was somewhat meaningless. To treat this empty and anxious heart disease, I needed to borrow the honey-like love between men and women to irrigate and nourish it. It was a great need, and I was eager to find a lover who met my conditions and hoped they would arrive soon. Unfortunately, the conditions I had set were too demanding. Where could I find such a person in a short time? I couldn't treat my aspirations as a game and slightly lower my standards to accommodate vulgar people. Walking alone without a place to turn, my heart was filled with strange boredom. Gradually, I thought of temporarily resuming a more romantic lifestyle to dispel my current bad mood. However, I could no longer go to brothels. I would treat the few wealthy patrons I knew from my days as a courtesan, as well as some famous figures of the present, as friends and socialize with them. I could put on a performance on occasion, which would be harmless. These people had long admired my beauty and had mourned my entry into a wealthy household and my separation from the streets. Now that I had fallen into the dust again and was a free agent, who wouldn't want to chase after me and take advantage of me? Naturally, I could go anywhere and receive a grand welcome. Before long, the general society was stirred up by my activities. Everyone unanimously praised me as the most popular social flower. Every day, I was invited to banquets and parties. I was invited to someone's home to play cards and eat, or I was invited by a certain minister to dine at a restaurant. Or I was invited by a certain general to listen to a play in a theater box, or I was invited by a certain celebrity to watch a movie or go to a dance hall. Both Chinese and foreigners were welcome, and both old and new were welcome. In terms of entertainment, everyone was trying their best to please me. I would no longer feel lonely. In addition, there were many gifts and rewards, such as gambling money, which supplemented my income. Although these people were ambitious and treated me like a private prostitute, secretly harboring ulterior motives and wanting to lure me back into the brothel, I was already much more experienced and skillful. I was able to adapt to the situation and keep them at arm's length, playing them around and leaving them frustrated. And I remained free as the sky.</p>

<p>▲ Declaration of Establishment. The wheels of the era are advancing rapidly. Looking at the trajectory of history, from scattered to gathered, and surveying the societies of various countries, all kinds of occupational groups have strict organizations. Our country's industrial and commercial industries each have corresponding organizations. We, who have the responsibility of guiding secondary education, do not dare to consider ourselves the pioneers of the times, nor do we dare to consider ourselves the laggards of the times. At a time when internal strife is frequent and foreign troubles are pressing, the times and the environment do not allow us to be like Lao Tzu's chickens and dogs, who hear each other's voices but do not interact with each other until they die. Since we have recognized our environment and understood the mission we bear, we have organized this association in accordance with the general principles of social evolution and the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. The work that should be done is divided into the following: 1. This association is not a dummy organization, but a labor organization. It brings together people who are engaged in the same profession, regardless of their differences, to gather the essence of their thoughts and meet the needs of the times, so as to seek the long-term welfare of secondary education. 2. Secondary education takes on the deficiencies of primary education and opens up the path for researching specialized academic subjects. Its responsibilities are very important. In this era of scientific prosperity and academic innovation, how can our country's culture be promoted and how can world culture be introduced and discussed? These are the important tasks of this association. 3. The waste of thought and the chaos of scholarship are worse than ever before. Young students have weak wills and novel opinions. They rely solely on personal intuition to act arbitrarily. This kind of emotion, if used well, can benefit the country and the people. Otherwise, if high pressure is applied, the future will be unimaginable. As for how to guide young people out of confusion and how to lead students back to the right track, the members of this association should [plan ahead] and learn from each other's strengths to provide appropriate guidance. This responsibility is also what we should bear. 4. Modern education is superficial and impractical, and cannot be trusted by people in society. In the future, we should learn from the past and be more careful. We should provide students with practical and effective education, and demand reasonable living standards for ourselves. In other words, how should the school curriculum be compiled? How should books and instruments be equipped? How should teaching materials be compiled? How should theories be studied? Everything, everything, must be [mutually observing and good] [choosing good and following it] to reach the ideal path. 5. Recently, the Japanese pirates have become increasingly deep. The comrades of this association have always been patriotic. In this time of national crisis, we should, on the one hand, urge the government to recover the lost territories, and on the other hand, guide young people to cultivate national strength in an effective way, laying the foundation for saving the country through academics. The above five points are just the major points. Other things, such as thrift and savings, promoting research, and organizing cooperative agencies, are all things that we should strive for.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Shanghai University Presidents' Luncheon Meeting <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>▲ Presidents of both public and private universities attended</p>
<p>▲ The Educational Association used the occasion to express its views</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Presidents' Luncheon Meeting, the tenth of its kind, was held yesterday (Saturday) on the eighth floor of the Hua An Building. The hosts were Hu Shuhua of Tongji University, Xiao Youmei of the Music Academy, and Zhang Shouyong of Guanghua University. Guests included university presidents Chu Minyi, Zheng Hongnian, Li Zhaoning, Sheng Zhenwei, Ou Yuanhuai, Liu Zhanen, Cao Huiqun, Jin Tongyin, and Wang Jingqi (representing Ding), totaling over twenty people. After several rounds of drinks and dishes, Hu Shuhua first delivered a speech on behalf of the hosts, expressing hope for a prosperous new year for all the presidents and raising a toast to their health. He then introduced Kang Xuanyi, representative of the preparatory committee of the University Faculty and Staff Association, explaining the association's spirit, which is as follows: ㈠ The association is purely motivated by a selfless spirit, striving to become a purely free and moral union, without any background influence. ㈡ The organizers have no intention of monopolizing; the organization is also quite democratic. In principle, all school staff are considered faculty and can enjoy equal rights, with no bias towards presidents or professors. All universities, large and small, have an equal opportunity to participate. ㈢ The source of funds is a contribution of fifty yuan from each of the initiating universities, collected by Zhang Shouyong and Zheng Hongnian and stored at the Shanghai Bank. Withdrawals require the signatures of both Zhang and Zheng. No donations have been solicited from any other sources. ㈣ Membership fees are not currently being collected; only those who complete the membership procedures have an obligation to pay fees. ㈤ The association is not in a hurry to have all Shanghai faculty and staff join; it is currently being started by a small group of people, with the intention that the entire academic community will benefit from it in the future. University representatives do not have to represent the entire school; members can join the association voluntarily from each school. ㈥ The association will never adopt an antagonistic attitude towards any other organization, as various organizations can coexist and achieve the same goals through different paths. Mutual suspicion would only show the world a lack of magnanimity. ㈦ The association is pragmatic and aims to be substantial and sound, avoiding empty rhetoric and unrealistic goals. Finally, it hopes that all schools will understand any past shortcomings in the association's work and sincerely invites all schools to join in cooperation, especially hoping to concentrate all Shanghai educational talent, unify the organization, show no signs of division, and preserve a pure and untainted reputation. The postponement of the association's representative assembly is also a compromise and does not involve waiting for non-member schools to produce representatives. The association is willing to accept the strictest supervision from the entire Shanghai academic community and will sever ties with the academic community and submit to public criticism if it ever tarnishes the reputation of the academic community. Zhang Shouyong and Zheng Hongnian then spoke in succession to supplement the explanation. After hearing this, many university presidents expressed their willingness to elect representatives to join in cooperation. The meeting concluded at 4 PM at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge area, where the date of the representative assembly will be decided.</p>

<p>▲ A 2-2 Draw in the First Half</p>
<p>▲ Result: 2-4 Defeat</p>
<p>Today's Match Against Jinan</p>
<p>The Malayan Chinese Overseas Football Team, visiting Shanghai for the second time, played its first match yesterday afternoon at 3 PM at the Chinese Baseball Field. Everyone exerted themselves, eliciting continuous cheers from the audience. However, due to their unfamiliarity with fighting in the frigid climate, the heroes were greatly troubled in the last forty-five minutes. The first match thus ended in defeat. Donghua, on the other hand, displayed an organized lineup and courageous spirit to extinguish the strong enemy, and their reward of a 4-2 victory was well-deserved. Referee: He Chunhui.</p>
<p>Donghua Team Lineup:</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Guan Xunan, Chen Pu, Tu Kaiyuan, Chen Jiaqiu (Upper), Jin Yuanqian (Lower), Qian Jingyong, Chen Hongguang, Dai Linjing, Chen Jiaqiu (Lower), Li Yichen (Upper), Chen Yutian.</p>
<p>Malaya Team Lineup:</p>
<p>Huang Jinbo, Yu Zhuohua, Xu Jintang, Gan Jinlu, Jian Dehui (Upper), Huang Kehou (Lower), Liang Fulai, Huang Kehou (Upper), Liu Jinrong, Guan Xinde, Li Wenjie, Xie Jinfu, Deng Yueyun, Xia Haishan (Lower).</p>
<h3 id="e164">12,000 People Support Football <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Malayan skills have long been admired by football fans at sea, and the Donghua talents are also outstanding figures of the time. Once the decision to meet was made, Jin Shenfu Road suddenly saw a rush of traffic, and the baseball field became a sea of people. The scale of the excitement was no less than the rematch between Donghua and Norsonburg. There were 8,827 six-corner seat tickets and 1,325 one-yuan seat tickets, totaling 10,152 tickets (with an estimated income of 5,738 yuan). The actual number of people was around 12,000. The cheers and shouts of these 12,000 people encouraged the soldiers' courage and fueled the interest in the football match, which can be said to have indirectly made them the protagonists of the day's event.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Malaya Unaccustomed to Cold <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Malaya grows under the tropics, unlike Donghua, which is accustomed to the cold. Once in the harsh, cold wind, they feel their muscles shrink. At first, they can resist, but after a long time, four or five people suffered leg cramps due to the cold, and their equal or superior position was reduced to a state of coercion, ultimately leading to a 2-4 surrender. It was not their fault; it was the severe cold climate that caused it. Regarding the team's overall skills, running and heading are their strengths. As for individual skills, goalkeeper Huang Jinbo is agile and has made countless saves. Inside forwards Guan Xinde and Xie Jinfu have sharp feet and will advance whenever there is an opportunity. Center forward Li Wenjie is good at charging, but his progress was limited due to Tu Kaiyuan's surveillance. Jian Dehui's midfield is very promising, and the substitution of Huang Kehou in the second half created gaps in the center, giving Donghua opportunities to move. Both inside backs Xu Jintang and Yu Zhuohua have heads as hard as iron, often defending unyielding in the face of overwhelming attacks. Left winger Liu Jinrong is more impressive than the two right wingers Deng and Xia, with Deng's skills being above Xia's. Both forwards are average. Looking at the overall situation, they were awe-inspiring and free in the first half, but retreated to a corner and lacked defense in the second half.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Origin of Donghua's Victory <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Donghua's victory was due in part to the enemy's unfamiliarity with the climate, but the team's excellent performance was also universally acknowledged. Tu Kaiyuan's midfield is becoming increasingly masterful and has become the best Chinese midfielder in recent times. Chen Pu is experienced, Chen Jiaqiu is clever, and Jin Yuanqian, a talented forward, has more strength than intelligence. However, Donghua's third and fourth goals were both said to have been created by him, making him a lucky general. Li Ning and Guan Xunan advance and retreat in an orderly manner, as solid as a copper wall and iron barrier. Goalkeeper Zhou Xianyan was slightly alarmed, but there were no major flaws, and his merits and demerits canceled each other out. Dai Linjing did not show much in the first half under the close pursuit of the enemy Jian Dehui, but he was free to move after being replaced by someone else in the second half. His once horse-riding-and-arrow-shooting goal was truly amazing. Li Yichen has strong feet but lacks speed. Chen Hongguang's charge is outstanding and his courage is exceptional. Chen Yutian is promising and still agile. Qian Jingyong has not made much progress and often commits offside. The turning point for Donghua was the substitution of Chen Jiaqiu for Li Yichen, making the five forwards incredibly fast.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Malaya Surprised at the Start <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>As the silver whistle blew, the Malayan army attacked, and Guan Xunan headed the ball out twice, removing the danger. Donghua took the opportunity to counterattack, and goalkeeper Huang Jinbo was the first to bear the brunt, resisting the strong enemy. Center forward Dai received a supply from Yutian and shot at the goal, but Huang caught it with a casual hand. Then, Qian Jing kicked a corner, and Huang jumped out from the inside again at the appropriate point. Li Yichen charged, and Chen Hongguang shot with the momentum, but Huang saved it safely again. Huang's amazing performance was praised throughout the stadium.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Donghua Safe After Hitting the Goalpost <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>From then on, Malaya's momentum was strong, and the ball was brought in from the left. Guan Xinde picked it off to the center, and center forward Li flew forward. Goalkeeper Zhou, seeing the situation was not good, rushed out to save it. At this time, Malaya's siege had been formed. After fifteen minutes of attacking from the left and right and advancing from the front and back, right winger Deng picked it off, Guan Xinde dribbled past a person, and goalkeeper Zhou missed. The ball suddenly cut onto the goalpost, and the goal was spared. This failure to score was a foreshadowing of victory. Right winger Chen took the opportunity to invade, and goalkeeper Huang pushed it out. Hongguang advanced again, and Huang dealt with it properly. Malaya came again, Guan Xinde shot, and goalkeeper Zhou caught it and dropped it again. Center forward Li rushed to pounce, and goalkeeper Zhou lay on the ground to block it, finally announcing safety.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Changes Within Five Minutes <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>At the twenty-third minute, Chen Hongguang, in the enemy's formation, passed the ball to Li. Li Yichen dribbled the ball forward and suddenly shot it straight to the goal. Goalkeeper Huang was too slow to block it, and Malaya lost the goal. Looking back, the five Malayan tigers arrived in succession. Xie Jinfu shot from the ground, and goalkeeper Zhou wanted to save it but was too late. Within five minutes, each side scored a goal, which can be described as a great change.</p>
<h3 id="e170">A 2-2 Draw in the First Half <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>After this change, Donghua's military morale was stimulated. The forwards passed each other and attacked. Center forward Dai used clever tactics, but goalkeeper Huang rushed out and broke it, and his skill could be seen. Li Yichen continued to attack, but was also blocked by the goalkeeper. Xie Jinfu of Malaya shot again, hitting the goalpost and rebounding out of danger. Dai avoided the attention of others and picked it off from the right. Chen Yutian hit the goalkeeper's body and struggled several times. Suddenly, midfielder Tu flew his leg and hit the goalpost with a bang, entering the net. Donghua took a 2-1 lead. The situation changed again, and Malaya took the offensive. Guan and Li defended strictly. After a few minutes, right winger Deng passed to the center, and Guan Zhude shot smoothly, hitting the target and creating a 2-2 draw in the first half.</p>

<p>▲ Donghua Takes the Advantage in the Second Half</p>
<p>As the second half started, Malaya's performance was reduced due to the influence of the climate. At the same time, Donghua's forwards were more agile than before, and they were mostly on the attack within forty-five minutes. If it weren't for the sound inside backs and reliable goalkeeper, the overall situation would have been unimaginable. At the tenth minute, Donghua suffered a scare, but Zhou threw it out. Afterwards, Chen Jiaqiu and Chen Hongguang successively attacked fiercely, but they failed every time they encountered goalkeeper Huang. At the twenty-fourth minute, Chen Hongguang finally scored a goal. Before long, Chen Hongguang bent down and greeted the ball with his head, but goalkeeper Huang caught it again. Finally, center forward Dai shot in a horse-riding-and-arrow-shooting posture, scoring a goal. As a result, they won 4-2.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Financial: Gold Market Spirited Last Week <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>▲ Four Consecutive Weeks of Increases... Breaking Through 700 Taels</p>
<p>▲ Limited Transaction Volume, Most Long Positions Tightened: The gold market was particularly spirited last week, but the situation was peaceful and without special fluctuations. Due to the New Year's holiday, trading only opened on Tuesday. It was slightly sluggish at first, probably due to the influence of the continuous rise in the silver market, which caused the opening price to be 678.5 taels. Later, due to the tightening of the foreign exchange market, it soared, breaking through the 700-tael mark. However, the daily range was only within 10 taels. On Thursday, it suddenly reached a peak of 711 taels. Finally, the silver price rose, and it retreated back below 700 taels in a soft environment. The total weekly fluctuation was 32.5 taels, with a net increase of 7.9 taels, marking four consecutive weeks of increases. The British and American silver markets and foreign exchange, etc., all tended to shrink. This was a reverse reaction after the consecutive small declines in British and American exchange rates. As a result, the trading price of the US exchange rate was leveled out, and the initial quoted price was around 40 taels, later 50 taels. Initially, Yufeng and Yongguang took in red bars, so it was increased to 15-16 taels, then suppressed to around 10 taels. However, the trading volume of the exchange was not large, only 20,000-odd lots, and most of them were held by large long positions, refusing to let go. It is said that Yufeng, Yongheng, Fuchang, and a certain bank all held long positions, while the Dalian gang held short positions, along with Yifeng, Yuanmao Yong, and Tongtaichang. The general situation of the week's progress is recorded below.</p>
<p>Three Consecutive Days of Increase After Opening, Slight Decline at the Weekend: From the beginning of the week, January 4, the large bar increased by 1.25, and the American silver also increased by 1.25. However, all banks and gold exchanges were on holiday, so there was no trading activity. On Tuesday, the large bar increased by another .0625, while the American silver shrank by .125. The advance order increased by .25, and the US dollar only increased by .125, due to the small exchange rate. Internally, the British market was flat and the American market was tight. The bidding for gold had already started. The initial opening price was 678.5 taels, a decrease of 7 taels compared to the previous New Year's Eve. It then rose by more than 10 taels, reaching 96 taels, because the buying was extremely smooth. In the midday market, a certain Wu sold, causing it to fall to 89 taels, and then 90.5 taels in the afternoon. The afternoon opened at 90.8 taels, then 2.8 taels, and closed at 90.02 taels, with a total increase of 4.7 taels. The difference between the front and rear markets was 17.5 taels, but there was little turnaround. The red bars were increased to 15-16 taels. On Wednesday, the large bar continued to rise by .0625, the silver market did not change, the advance order remained the same, and the US dollar decreased by .125, which was to offset the exchange rate. The internal market still saw the British market rising and the American market falling. The gold gangs first grabbed and then released. The initial opening price for gold was 93.5 taels, an increase of 3.3 taels, then 2.3 taels, and then it broke through 700 taels, reaching 700.05 taels, due to the pursuit of large players. Later, because of news from abroad that cash could be used to pay war debts instead of gold, the market became depressed and selling became rampant, plunging more than 9 taels, suddenly to 91.2 taels. The midday closing price was 94.6 taels. The afternoon opened at 97 taels and closed at 94.1 taels, another increase of 3.9 taels. On Thursday, the large bar had already shrunk by .25, the silver market shrunk by .625, the advance order shrunk by one level, and the US dollar shrunk by half a yuan. The internal market was also tight, and the grabbing was unremitting. The initial opening price for gold increased by 9.4 taels, to 703.5 taels. Then there was a slight range, but the buying was agile, reaching 711 taels. Suddenly, large players came to sell, immediately falling to 05.5 taels, then 10 taels, causing panic. The midday closing price was 07.7 taels. The afternoon was 05.5 taels, then it fell from 06 taels to 03 taels. By the closing price, it was 09.5 taels (a total increase of 29.5 taels in four consecutive days), an increase of 15.4 taels compared to the previous day. The daily range was 8 taels. Wu and Yifeng both sold. On Friday, the large bar shrunk by .375, the silver market increased by 0.125, which was a rebound in the exchange rate. The advance order shrunk by one and a half levels, the US dollar did not change. The internal market also had a different trend, with the British market tight and the American market loose. The initial opening price for gold was 700 taels, immediately falling by 9.5 taels, especially with Chengfeng Yong selling first. However, all firms bought, and it immediately rose by 4 taels, to 04.5 taels. Later, with more selling downstream, and hearing that the American people opposed the American government not following the convention to stop Japan's violation of China, the market declined, plunging by 8-9 taels, the midday closing price was 95.6 taels. The afternoon was 96.5 taels, then 8.5 taels. Later, due to more selling and the turbulent situation, it fell to 95.1 taels. Suddenly, Wu and others competed to buy, and it returned to 701.5 taels. By the closing price, it was 99.8 taels, a slight decrease of 9.7 taels compared to the previous day, which was a reaction to four consecutive days of increases. The daily range was 9.4 taels. On Saturday, the large bar increased by 0.125, the silver price increased by 0.375, the advance order did not change, and the US dollar only increased by 0.125. The internal market tended to loosen. The gold market opened small by 5.8 taels, to 94 taels, then from 6.2 taels, it returned to 3.2 taels. Yiji continued to offset the shorts, reaching 96.6 taels. Afterwards, there was a slight fluctuation, forcing the midday closing price to 92.4 taels, a decrease of 6.4 taels compared to the previous day. The range in the second half of the day was only 3.4 taels. The market was flat. The high and low prices of the British and American silver markets and the gold bidding are listed below:</p>
<p>Type | Highest | Lowest | Change from Previous Saturday</p>

Also, according to a telegram from New York, the American silver price also shrunk by .25 to 2 shillings .9875. Private telegrams also fell by .125, totaling 3 shillings .0125. The market was quiet. The British against the American market fell by half a point, and the American against the British market fell by .125, both at 3 yuan 40 cents. The British Shanghai shilling shortened by .25 to 1 shilling 10 pence .375. The Mumbai market was closed.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Interest Rate Falls Sharply <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday. The market interest rate fell sharply in the morning, only 7 cents 1 dime 4 li 2 hao and a half. In the midday market, it rebounded by about 1 li, to 7 cents 1 dime 5 li 1 hao and a half. The result was a fall of more than 1.5 li. The lowest difference was 3 li, which can be said to be a change in the market. The silver spread was 6 points in both the morning and midday markets. The amount of foreign exchange bills was 475,000 in the morning and 520,000 in the midday market. Banknotes were only 50,000 in the morning.

<h3 id="e177">Securities Market During the First Week of the Year <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sharp Decline of Three to Four Yuan… February Futures Trading Commenced on Saturday</p>
<p>The situation of the Shanghai securities and bond market during the past week (from January 4th to 9th): The Exchange had originally scheduled to open on Tuesday, but due to other reasons on that day, there were no transactions in either spot or futures. Therefore, there were only four trading days in the past week. Many types of spot goods were traded daily, and activity was not sluggish. The total turnover for the week was 155,800 yuan, including 26,000 yuan each for 1921 Customs Bonds, 24,000 yuan for Consolidated Tax Bonds, 23,500 yuan for 1920 Bonds, 18,300 yuan for Sixth Year Bonds, 18,000 yuan for Salt Tax Bonds, 6,000 yuan for 1921 Bonds, 5,000 yuan for Customs Bonds, and 4,000 yuan each for 1921 Relief Bonds and Disbandment Bonds, and 1,000 yuan for Seventh Year Bonds. However, there was no trading in 1996 Bonds. The futures market remained sluggish, with major players taking a wait-and-see attitude and market activity as quiet as before. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, only January futures were traded, with February futures opening only towards the weekend. Daily trading volume, for example, was only over 2.6 million yuan on Friday, and only 4 to 5 million yuan on other days, totaling 16.445 million yuan in four days. This included 2.665 million yuan for January Salt Tax Bonds, only 5,000 yuan for February Salt Tax Bonds, 2.625 million yuan for January Consolidated Tax Bonds, 10,000 yuan for January First Month Bonds, 2.4 million yuan for January 1920 Bonds, 5,000 yuan for February First Month Bonds, 2.175 million yuan for January 1921 Bonds, 10,000 yuan for February First Month Bonds, 2.075 million yuan for January 1921 Relief Bonds, 10,000 yuan for February First Month Bonds, 1.64 million yuan for January 1920 Bonds, 30,000 yuan for February Bonds, 1.12 million yuan for January Disbandment Bonds, 10,000 yuan for February First Month Bonds, 1.005 million yuan for January Consolidation Bonds, 5,000 yuan for February First Month Bonds, 260,000 yuan for January Customs Bonds, 5,000 yuan for February First Month Bonds, only 340,000 yuan for January Sixth Year Bonds, and only 45,000 yuan for 1996 Bonds. As for the price fluctuations of various bonds during the past week, the market was very weak on Wednesday, with all parties tending to sell and demand being scarce. The supply and demand for bonds were very disparate. At the beginning of the morning, the prices fell sharply. Consolidated Tax futures then fell to the limit price and trading was suspended. Other bonds such as 1920 Customs Bonds, Bonds, Salt Tax Bonds, etc., also almost reached the point of suspension, with prices falling by about two or three yuan. This was due to the large-scale Japanese advance in recent days, the fall of Jinzhou, and the imminent danger of Jehol Province. There was great shock in Tianjin and Beijing, and foreign media were anxious. Empty words of calm and non-resistance led to the loss of territory on a daily basis, causing panic among the people and a significant impact on the securities market. In the following two days, the situation did not improve, and all parties were in a state of stagnation. The bonds were then in a state of fluctuation, with no major changes. There was a slight rise on Thursday, and a general fatigue on Friday, with only minor ups and downs. However, on the last day of the weekend, there were new changes in the situation. Although our domestic politics were chaotic, the United States suddenly issued a strong note of declaration to Japan. Although it is still difficult to predict how the great powers will react to this, we are both happy and worried. The market sentiment was again anxious, and selling surged, causing prices to fall by about two or three yuan again. Furthermore, other factors that affect the bond market, although the external situation is the biggest reason, the free retention of tax revenues by foreign provinces also deals a major blow to the bond market. Therefore, the current situation in the bond market cannot be reversed by empty words of maintenance. It is necessary to take a holistic approach and consolidate credit before recovery is possible. The following is a statistical list of the highest, lowest, and fluctuations in the prices of various bonds during the past four days of the week (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e178">Yarn and Cotton Prices Fell Last Week <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sichuan and Guangdong Traders Have an Appetite for Spot Goods</p>
<p>The demand for cotton yarn was increasingly sluggish in the past week. Because Japan's aggression in the Northeast intensified day by day, causing financial tightness, commercial depression, and public weariness. Only the Sichuan and Guangdong traders showed some improvement, while others remained stagnant. Moreover, Japanese yarn was secretly rebranded and shipped to other ports, intensifying, which further impacted local yarn. The bidding situation became increasingly scattered. Due to the tight credit, deteriorating situation, and numerous rumors, as well as the approaching settlement deadline, the market atmosphere was unusually bleak. Transactions in the market were scarce, with even black market trading occurring daily. Furthermore, Jinzhou was seized by the violent Japanese, leading to a surge in selling pressure. Prices for all months fell by one or two taels to seven or eight qian. The following is a list comparing the highest and lowest bid prices among brokers this week:</p>
<p>| Yarn   | Highest | Lowest | Weekend Price | Compared to End of Year |</p>
<p>| ------ | ------- | ------ | ------------- | ----------------------- |</p>

<h3 id="e179">Hankou Cotton Prices Unstable Last Week <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>▲ Prices for All Months Down by About One or Two Taels</p>
<p>▲ Demand for Spot Cotton Completely Stalled</p>
<p>The cotton market has been trending downward since the red market opened. This is due to the sluggishness of overseas cotton markets, the urgency of credit, and the stagnation of actual sales. Factories have already absorbed enough foreign cotton and have no appetite for purchasing local cotton. Moreover, the prices of goods from various local sources have been held for too long without anyone intervening, causing prices to fall daily and stirring up public anxiety. The market situation has become unstable and is declining step by step. However, some bulls in Hankou cotton are still holding tight. At the weekend, American cotton rebounded slightly, but the silver price calculation is still cheap, so the overall trend is still to depress flat cotton. The prices for all months of standard cotton are down by nearly one or two taels compared to before trading was suspended at the end of last year, with the near months down by six or seven qian. The following is a list comparing the highest and lowest prices for Hankou standard cotton during the week:</p>
<p>| Hankou Standard Cotton | Highest | Lowest | Weekend Price | Compared to End of Year |</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was firm and lively. It was firm due to buying by peers, and then softened due to some bulls liquidating. Futures rose by one to three points, while spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures rose by eight or nine points, while spot prices rose by six points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by ten points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (9th telegram)</p>

<p>▲ More Than Ten Rice Shops from Southern Shanghai Arrived Yesterday, and the Township Stores Picked Over and Slightly Moved Thick New Japonica Rice, with Nearly a Thousand Stones. Not Much Early Indica Rice Arrived. The Ningbo and Local Street Sales Markets Were Stable and Not Bad. The Market Situation Was Firm. Not Many Reed Field Pointed Rice Arrived, and Demand Was Also Slack. The Two Kinds of Yin Hua and Tong Bian Rice Were in Great Demand by Wineries, and Prices Rose by Three Cents.</p>
<p>▲ Forty to Fifty Ships Arrived at Xinzha. The Local Street Sales Market Was Best for Xiyi Traders. Thin Indica Rice Wind and Sand Boat Traders Purchased Slightly, and the Market Was High and Tight and Relatively Stable. White Japonica Rice from Jiang and Kunshan Sold Well. Opening Prices Were Reduced by Several Points. Foreign Port Pointed Rice Sold Competitively, with No Rise or Fall in Prices. A Total of About 4,000 Dan of River Factory Goods.</p>

<p>▲ Cocoon Merchants Hoarding Goods... There is Almost No Formal Market for Remote Song Goods. In the past year, the spring, summer, and autumn silkworm cocoon harvests in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have all been poor, and the production of double cocoon silk has also decreased accordingly. The European sales of double cocoon silk are still relatively strong. Among the six double cocoon silk factories in Shanghai, more than half are operating at times. The sales of double cocoon cocoons are quite strong, resulting in increasingly thin inventories. Currently, the number of double cocoon cocoons in Shanghai warehouses is limited, and cocoon merchants are hoarding goods. Opening prices are still high, with ordinary goods requiring seventy or eighty taels. High-quality goods from remote areas are even scarcer, with almost no formal market.</p>

<p>Due to the weekday yesterday, hardware transactions were unusually sluggish. However, the trading of British thin galvanized iron was very prosperous yesterday, with a total of more than 10,000 sheets traded. Although the market price did not improve immediately, it felt much better than before. It is estimated that a 36-foot sheet is worth one tael and three qian, and a 37-foot sheet is worth one tael and two qian. However, futures transactions were slightly cheaper by one or two cents.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Shanghai Gains Another "Patient" Fortunately... <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>If someone were to investigate and count the number of "important figures" and "secondary figures" currently staying in Shanghai for [medical treatment], there would be at least a dozen or more. The nation is facing so many difficulties, and the important figures are so frequently ill. This is truly a case of [misfortunes never come singly].</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Yuxiang has always been in good health. This time, in order to [jointly overcome the difficulties of the times], he resolutely came south. When Mr. Feng arrived in Shanghai, all the newspapers, large and small, said that Mr. Feng's [complexion was full, and his spirit was abundant]. However, as soon as he arrived in Shanghai, he also quickly became ill. On the 7th, he telegraphed the Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen, saying: [Yuxiang is recuperating in Shanghai and has not yet fully recovered and is currently under treatment]. Ah, Mr. Feng is sick again. Shanghai has gained another "sick" "important figure." Did Mr. Feng really get sick? Some say: [I ate with Mr. Feng somewhere the day before yesterday, and I saw that his appetite was better than others, his voice was loud and clear, and his spirit was high, with no signs of illness]; some say: [At 4:15 p.m. the day before yesterday, Mr. Feng went to the Nar Hospital on Avenue Joffre to visit Mr. Wang Jingwei, and they talked for half an hour;] and others say: [On the 7th, Mr. Feng wrote a letter to his old comrades, earnestly urging them to be physically strong]. If Mr. Feng's illness is a fact, then the above news is certainly not a fact. Conversely, if the news is a fact, then Mr. Feng's illness is at least a doubtful fact.</p>
<p>If Mr. Feng was originally not sick but insisted on saying that he was sick, then that is [feigning illness] or [pretending illness]. Feigning illness and pretending illness are the traditional bad habits of Chinese officials. We do not hope that Mr. Feng has also contracted this bad habit. [If we agree, we stay; if we disagree, we leave]. There is no room for evasion or pretense. Every politician should have this kind of open and aboveboard attitude. Feigning illness and pretending illness are just sneaky activities. What we, the common people, need are officials who are:</p>
<p>Healthy,</p>
<p>Honest,</p>
<p>Open and aboveboard,</p>
<p>Serving the people and the country.</p>
<p>We must eliminate all [sick officials] and all [corrupt officials]!</p>

<p>[Willow banks, dawn wind, waning moon] and I get it from…</p>
<p>1.  The window of the West Building! At that time, my dormitory in the school was a large room facing west. There were more than ten people in the same dormitory, and my bed was exactly laid by the window. Often in the middle of the night I would wake up naturally, and naturally no longer sleep. I would sit up, breathing the cool air that was like wind but not wind, staring at the half-circle of the bright moon, and the battlements on the city wall hundreds of steps away, both of us silently facing each other;</p>
<p>2. On Guandi Temple Square! Later, because I liked quietness, one winter, I moved to a deserted Guandi Temple three miles away from the school. Every day, before the east was even white, I would rush to school to eat breakfast at 6:30. I stepped on the snow-like heavy frost all the way, and thought of [moonlight in front of the bed]. When I looked up, sure enough, there was a bay of waning moon and a few scattered stars in the dim sky, constantly flickering against the cold north wind;</p>
<p>3. On the top of Mogan Mountain! One summer, I stayed on Mogan Mountain for two weeks. On the day I went down the mountain, according to the prevailing custom at that time, I rushed to a friend's place to get on the sedan chair before dawn. As I walked through the winding stone steps, my head was constantly sprinkled with falling bright pearls and white jade, and my feet trampled on the white plum blossoms and magnolia petals that were spread all over. I was really surprised and happy. Oh, it turned out that the bamboo all over the mountain, the dense layers of thin branches and leaves, were listening to the good intentions of the clear wind in the dawn, and were filtering down half of the clear brilliance of Chang'e;</p>
<p>4. Inside the pavilion! Now I can only run around in Shanghai for food and clothing. Thanks to the kindness of the landlord, the direction of the house is adapted to the local conditions. In the low pavilion, my dormitory, based on the position of the North Star at night, actually faces northwest. Therefore, although I can never see the round moon or blow the cool wind of summer or the warm wind of spring, I can often see half of the white jade plate, which is assumed to be obscured, and I can enjoy some of the summer heat and winter cold morning air in the window, and I am satisfied;</p>
<p>Where will I get it in the future? I do not know.</p>

<h3 id="e190">New Theory That Eating Sweets Does Not Harm Teeth Chang Tian <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>[Eating too many sweets will definitely cause tooth decay] was originally an old saying, tamed into a powerful hygiene motto in society. Even the general class of doctors all believe this to be a matter of course and often advise people with children not to eat too many sweets. However, according to scientists, sweet foods are rich in nourishment. It is extremely beneficial for children to eat them. It is indispensable during the developmental period. So, is there a considerable relationship between dental disease and sweets? It is necessary to solve it immediately.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a female doctor in England named Mrs. Mellanby, who has done specialized research on this issue. She is a specialist in orthopedics and dentistry, so her research is of course very credible. According to the results of her recent research, it is believed that there is no direct relationship between sweets and dental disease. Children who eat sweets, under certain circumstances, can not only not develop dental disease, but also because sweets are rich in nourishment, it is not too much to eat them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mellanby's statement is certainly not empty talk. She has actual experiments. Initially, she used puppies to test them. She fed dogs with sugar food every day. After they grew up, not only did they not see dental problems, but their body bones were better than normal dogs. At the same time, she also raised several puppies, feeding them candy on the one hand, and removing various fats and vegetables from their daily food on the other. After a long time, those dogs actually developed dental problems. Therefore, she determined that the onset of dental disease is definitely not due to the scourge of sugar food, but because the food lacks certain ingredients. This ingredient was subsequently determined to be [Vitamin A.]</p>
<p>[Vitamin A] is very rich in fat, especially in animal liver: green vegetables and radishes turn into this ingredient once they enter the human abdomen. Therefore, those with dental diseases, if they eat more of these things, can heal themselves without treatment. And if children can eat more cheap and good-quality green vegetables and radishes, then even if they chew candy all day long, they will not chew out dental problems.</p>
<p>Since Mrs. Mellanby published this opinion, it has attracted the attention of the medical community in various countries around the world. Many doctors in England have also used their own children as actual experiments. On the one hand, they carefully used a large amount of Vitamin A to supply the children, and on the other hand, they let them chew candy at will. According to their reports, the experimental results were satisfactory, and none of the children suffered from dental disease. I am introducing this new discovery to the people of the country, and I also hope that domestic doctors will rise up and test it.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Shanghai's Air and Sunlight Almonds <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>A's friend rented a rear living room from a chauffeur's second landlord. On the partition wall between the rear and front living rooms, there hung a painting of [Zhong Kui Catching Ghosts]. In this way, it completely blocked all the sunlight in the rear living room, making it pitch black. After my friend A moved in, he negotiated with the second landlord, asking him to move the painting away, allowing a little sunlight in. The reply obtained from the negotiation was... [Move it away, but you have to add a dollar], and finally, after adding a dollar, my friend bought a ray of sunlight from the second landlord's hand.</p>
<p>Soon after, I and a friend rented a garret in an alley near the French Park. Experience told us... the rent demanded by the second landlord was particularly expensive compared to the general rent. We asked him what the reason was. His reply was... [This house is near the park, and the air is very circulated, [so the rent is more expensive].</p>
<p>The words of the two second landlords vividly portray a commodified Shanghai. Shanghai is a Shanghai for the rich. Everything in Shanghai is commodified. The rich occupy everything, and the poor do not even have the possibility of freely receiving the air and sunlight that nature bestows on all things.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a paradise for the rich and a hell for the poor. East, West, South, North.</p>

<p>The other day, the supplement contained K's [Feng Yuxiang's Wonderful Couplet]. I was reminded of a good poem by Feng Yuxiang. Mr. Feng Yuxiang is a famous [soldier] in China. During his trip south, he was warmly welcomed by young students and mass organizations. You have surely seen the attire of this old gentleman, either at a welcome meeting or in the newspapers. Doesn't he look like a farmer? It is said that when he set off from Taiyuan, he bought two large bags of sesame cakes, and he had not finished eating them when he arrived in Shanghai!</p>
<p>Now I want to introduce Feng Yuxiang's wonderful poem, artist Xu Shiqi painted a picture of a rickshaw puller, and the old gentleman wrote such a seven-character ancient poem:</p>
<p>One person sits in the car, one person pulls,</p>
<p>Both are human beings, yet like cattle and horses,</p>
<p>Heavy oppression is truly painful!</p>
<p>Only hope that a benevolent person will come to save him.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Toothpicks are a Luxury K <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>After returning from participating in the International Statistical Conference, Liu Dajun, on January 3, talked about his impressions of passing through Soviet Russia at a welcome banquet held by the Economic Society: He said that one day, the Sino-Russian Conference delegation held a banquet in a very luxurious hotel in Moscow to treat him. After the meal, when he asked the waiter for a toothpick, the waiter brought a box of matches. Mr. Liu thought that the waiter had misunderstood his meaning, so he made a gesture with his hand and asked a person who was good at Russian to explain it to him. The waiter replied apologetically...</p>
<p>[Toothpicks are a luxury. We do not manufacture them in our country, and foreign goods are prohibited from being imported.]</p>
<p>Although this is a small matter, it is conceivable that on the one hand, the Soviet Union has been working hard to increase production in recent years, and on the other hand, it has also been working hard to reduce waste. Everyone lives the life of a worker and enjoys simplicity, so from the government's important officials, everyone can be clean and impartial, which is indeed a big reason.</p>

<p>▲ Chen Huacheng Died in Battle</p>
<p>At that time, Niu Jian, Governor-General of Liangjiang, was stationed in Shanghai, and Chen Huacheng, Jiangnan Admiral, was stationed in Wusong. Niu Jian arrived at Wusong from Shanghai and, seeing the towering British warships, towering more than ten feet above the sea embankment, with smoke covering the sky and dense guns and cannons, was very frightened. Huacheng tried his best to comfort him, saying: [The foreigners only rely on guns and cannons. I have experienced the ocean for fifty years, and I have been born and died in artillery fire many times. Today's fire attack is quite promising. I am willing to take the lead. If I can thwart their edge, and the reinforcements advance in one go, the British are really not enough to be defeated]. At dawn on the 8th, Huacheng first ordered the artillery to open fire and sink two British warships. When the British army landed from the East Fort, the guards Wei Yinfu and others guarded the West Fort and died in battle. Huacheng saw that the army had no reinforcements, beat his chest and stamped his feet, and sighed deeply, saying... [The English barbarians have been rampant for many years. Today, they have been slightly thwarted, and the overall situation in the interior is of great importance. Unexpectedly, the success of the project will be defeated in one fell swoop. The commander (referring to Niu Jian) will kill me].</p>
<p>All the soldiers fled, but Huacheng still fired the artillery alone and fought hard. Later, because he was attacked from the front and back, he was shot and died spitting blood. Huacheng was from Fujian. At that time, he was already a 76-year-old man. His great fearless spirit is worthy of posterity's worship! It is also said that his body was buried in the City God Temple.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Chapter 2: Establishment of Concessions <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Treaty of Nanking</p>
<p>After British warships left Shanghai and bombarded Zhenjiang, causing extremely brutal destruction and killings, they went on to disturb Yangzhou and attack Nanjing. The Qing court then appointed Qiying, Ilibu, and Niujian as plenipotentiary ministers. On July 24th, Daoguang 22nd year, they concluded the Sino-British Treaty of Amity, also known as the Treaty of Nanking, with British envoy Pottinger.</p>
<p>Within the Treaty of Nanking, there was a clause stating: [The Great Emperor graciously permits British people to bring back their families and reside in the five coastal ports of Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and Shanghai, to trade and conduct commerce without hindrance]. From this point on, Shanghai's doors were flung open, and a new destiny began. However, upon examining the original text of this treaty, it did not grant foreigners the right to lease land in China, nor did it designate any areas for residence (i.e., concessions).</p>
<p>Following the establishment of the Treaty of Nanking, both the United States and France sent ambassadors to the Qing court to request permission to trade in the five ports, including Shanghai, on equal terms with the British. The Qing court, mindful of the great losses suffered in the Opium War, readily agreed. On May 18th, Daoguang 24th year, they ordered Liangguang Governor-General Qiying to sign the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce with American envoy Caleb Cushing. Then, on September 13th of the same year, they ordered Imperial Commissioner Qiying to sign the Sino-French Treaty of Amity with French Plenipotentiary Minister Théodose de Lagrené. From then on, Shanghai became a commercial battleground divided by international imperialism. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e196">Please Take Home a Bit of Artistic Impression <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The League of Actors' Grand Performance. As a rule, all members currently in Shanghai must perform on stage. However, the time for the performances is limited, and each play can only accommodate a limited number of main characters. Moreover, the league's members often number close to a thousand. Trying to have a thousand actors perform in six or seven hours across a dozen or so plays creates a great difficulty in allocation, as there are too many monks and not enough gruel. Therefore, the solution of having eight or ten people jointly play one role was devised. Although this method is lively and pleasing, each actor's time on stage is too short, making it impossible to fully showcase their strengths, which is somewhat unsatisfactory. Furthermore, there are many plays that cannot be divided into scenes, so a large number of actors are asked to appear on stage at the same time. For example, in "Heavenly Maidens Scattering Flowers," eight heavenly maidens appear on stage together to sing; in "Hanjinkou," seven or eight Guan Gongs run out. Ultimately, this does not align with the logic of the story, and the audience is left bewildered, unable to discern who is superior. Therefore, starting from the last league performance, the method was changed. Instead of trying to include everyone, it's better to eliminate the crude and retain the refined, and specifically invite a few outstanding performers who have never had the opportunity to share the stage before to unite. Each role is played by one actor from beginning to end, with particular emphasis on the careful selection of the script. Only in this way can the artistry of the actors be fully expressed, and the audience can have a truly good show to watch. Because the purpose of the League of Actors' grand performance is not only to raise funds but also to promote the art of the acting world. It's definitely not just about getting everyone to spend money to watch a lively but ultimately empty show. At the very least, it should leave the audience with a bit of artistic impression, making them feel that these good plays are simply unavailable anywhere else except at the League of Actors' grand performance.</p>
<p>This year's League of Actors' grand performance is being done in this spirit. If you encounter such a grand event again, it will be at least a year later, because the League of Actors only actively organizes a grand performance once a year unless there are special circumstances. For acting events organized by outside parties, we will not issue a mobilization order for all members.</p>
<p>For the reasons mentioned above, we only have two plays in this year's grand performance. One is the complete "Crying at the Ancestral Temple," and the other is the complete "Tale of the Pipa."</p>
<h3 id="e197">Famous People and Famous Plays Shine Together <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>"Crying at the Ancestral Temple" is an extremely difficult play to sing. Since the death of Wang Lingyin, although others have performed it, few have been able to achieve acclaim. This is because the protagonist, Prince Beilou Liu Chen, struggles fiercely with Liu Adou in the first scene, arguing that "surrendering to the enemy is worse than dying in battle," and then in the second scene, he meets Lady Cui and sacrifices his family for the country. The plot is extremely tense, making the performance very demanding. Immediately afterward, he has to perform "Crying at the Ancestral Temple," with very little time for rest in between. The large sections of singing in "Crying at the Ancestral Temple" are divided into seven parts, with over a hundred lines in total, making it even more strenuous than singing "Bumping into the Monument." If the skill is even slightly lacking, it is difficult to avoid becoming hoarse and exhausted. Therefore, those who study Wang Lingyin's style of old male roles all regard this play with trepidation.</p>
<p>Madam Du is a famous socialite in Shanghai with a unique talent and profound knowledge. Not to mention that ordinary amateur actors cannot hope to match her, even renowned veterans of the acting world often sigh in admiration. Madam Du has put in a lot of deep study of the play "Crying at the Ancestral Temple." Therefore, she is able to handle it with ease. The League of Actors' performance has reached its 22nd iteration, and it has never previously relied on any outside performers. However, this time, they specifically and earnestly invited Madam Du to join and help. This is clear proof that Madam Du's art is able to convince all members of the League.</p>
<p>Madam Du is usually unwilling to easily appear in public. This time, it is truly because the matter concerns public welfare that she condescended to accept after the League repeatedly requested her. Not only is the League extremely grateful, but the audience will also be blessed with a rare treat. To add icing on the cake, the League has specially selected renowned actors to fill the supporting roles, aiming to make this performance of "Crying at the Ancestral Temple" the best in China's history.</p>
<p>The important role directly opposite Madam Du is Lady Cui, specially played by Ms. Li Huijin, a Kunqu actress skilled in tragic roles. They have rehearsed the scene of sacrificing the family countless times and have become extremely well-coordinated. It is expected that this scene will surely draw many tears. Please bring an extra handkerchief to the performance.</p>
<p>Deng Ai, China's first stuttering general, is an ambitious and ruthless warlord whose position is extremely important, and he will be performed by Mr. Zhou Xinfang. Zhuge Zhan and his son, in the face of extreme national crisis, disregarded the dangers and led the Shu troops, vowing to resist the enemy to the death. This spirit of saving the country can serve as a model for future generations of soldiers, and they will be played by Mr. Lin Shusen and Mr. Gao Xueqiao, respectively. One is loyal and devoted, and the other is courageous and fierce. Watching them can inspire the corrupt and cowardly.</p>
<p>Other roles, such as Chen Hefeng's Zhang Yi, Dong Zhiyang's Deng Zhong, Liu Kunrong's Ma Miao, Han Jinkui's Huang Hao, Zhao Dongsheng's Zhong Hui, Chen Jialin's Liu Shan, and Liu Wenmei's Lady Li, are all carefully selected from each troupe and are suited to each person's personality. They will all be able to perform in a fitting manner.</p>
<h3 id="e198">A Perfect Match in the Tale of the Pipa <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>To harmonize the audience's emotions, the League has, in addition to the national affairs play "Crying at the Ancestral Temple," also arranged a good social play, [the complete Tale of the Pipa]. The name of this play is so fragrant and elegant, and one can tell at a glance that it is a good play of joy and sorrow, separation and reunion, that can deeply move people. Mr. Xiao Yang Yuelou plays the female lead, Qin Xianglian, a deserted woman with a tragic fate, and his performance is extremely mournful and beautiful, making people heartbroken. Mr. Zhao Ruquan plays the male lead, Wang Yanling, a gentleman who speaks out for justice, combining solemnity and humor, which is hilarious. In addition, there is another important role, Chen Shimei, played by Mr. Zhang Guifen. He plays a heartless man, with both singing and acting emphasized, and there are many wonderful parts. Combining the best actors from the three theaters on one stage to play the main characters in the play truly makes for a genuine and high-quality "perfect match" play.</p>
