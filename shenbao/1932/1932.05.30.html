<h3 id="c1">對蘇復交釋疑彬· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自本報於本月十二十三十四三日連續發表「論對蘇復交與防遏共産。」「從國際情勢談到中蘇復交。」及「三論中蘇復交」三評。提出對蘇復交之主張而後。社會頗多應聲。同時天津大公報亦於本月十四日發表「中俄復交問題」一評。十九日又發表「再論對俄復交問題」一評。本月十六日北平晨報發表「釋對俄復交」一評。同日天津益世報亦發表「中俄復交」一評。就利害之分析。與事實之要求。都主張立即對蘇復交。但另一方面。深慮之士。則多以復交後之赤化宣傳爲可懼。反對之聲。亦再接再厲。吾人認爲此一問題。本至關重大。事實以研究而愈明其眞相。理論亦以辯駁而愈得正確。吾人固極尊重反對者之意見。同時亦不能不辯明其是非。兹特再就所見。爲反對對蘇復交者釋疑。</p>
<p>綜合持反對論者之意見。似多爲偏重感情之偏激之言。而少平心靜氣沉着踐實之論。如曰主張復交。爲希望他人救急。如曰主張復交者。彷彿認定對蘇復交爲今日中國之唯一出路。如曰蘇聯之一貫政策。爲打破國界。造成極少數人之絕對獨裁專政。是皆爲枝葉問題。且多爲臆度之言。其實吾人但認爲對蘇復交。爲通常之外交關係。並不因而希望他人「路見不平拔刀相助。」吾人更但認定對蘇復交。爲比較有利。絕未認其爲中國今日之唯一出路。除此而外。其所持之最大理由。即曰共産主義爲洪水猛獸。過去容共。旣已造成今日赤化勢力。瀰漫全國之局。若今日復與蘇聯復交。故予以宣傳上之便利。則前途將更不堪設想。似是矣。然而實非。</p>
<p>吾人認爲在討論此一問題之先。須認清「復交」「聯蘇」與「容共」爲三事。不容相提並論。「復交」非「聯蘇。」尤非「容共。」但爲恢復普通之外交關係。此爲普通常識。吾人固絕不應有若何之誤解。脫謂對蘇復交。將更予以共黨宣傳與活動之機會。使共黨勢力。愈益張大。則我國與蘇絕交已四年矣。共黨並未因而絕跡。勢反日益張大。抑且北方與蘇聯接壤關係較密之區。並無共黨遊撃之事。而南方湘鄂皖贛閩等省共黨之勢力。反如火如荼。由可知對蘇絕交。未必可以防遏共産。對蘇復交。亦未必可以使共黨擴大問題之重心在於我國是否有適合於共産主義之泥土。是否有足使共産主義流行之機會。如其有之。絕交奚益。如其無之。復交何害。置問題之根本不問。而欲以閉門政策。防遏共産主義之流入吁。物已先腐。雖置之鐵匣。果能保其不生蟲耶　　脫曰「我國無堅强之統一政府。」「嚴密之社會組織。」「穩定之人民生活。」「無控制共産主義者之把握。」故不容步武列强大開門户。讓「赤色恐怖之謀隂者。」自由出入。是則吾人旣已認定我國爲最適合共産主義之泥土矣。我國旣有此泥土。世即無蘇聯。亦難保不有革命之事實爆發。歷史上之變亂。斑斑可考。不修明内政。不安定民生。而欲以對蘇絕交。爲防遏亂萌之手段。所見不亦太左耶。</p>
<p>脫曰蘇聯未必爲能以平等待我之民族。故我國不必與之復交。則目前列强究誰爲平等待我之民族。自九一八以來。日本對我肆力侵略。置我於生死綫上。我亦未敢與之絕交也。何獨於蘇聯即視爲洪水猛獸。不可親近。脫曰對蘇復交。爲明明投身共産主義者。爲向帝國主義者宣戰。將引起列强之反感。則尤近於過慮。試問列强本身。除美對蘇復交尚在醖釀外。餘都已與蘇復交。究有何種理由。可以禁我復交。抑且外交之權。應操之在我。脫徒仰人鼻息。承人意旨。是又果爲立國之道耶。</p>
<p>總之吾人深盼國内遠識之士。對此問題。都平心靜氣。切實討論。毋徒作感情之言。更勿囿於成見。視蘇聯爲不可親近。資本主義之列强。對蘇聯今亦改變其昔日之觀念矣。吾人固不容長持保守派之主張而不變也。</p>

<p>接管會當與日方交涉</p>
<p>準今晨先視察後接收</p>
<p>日軍第一步撤退工作、業經次第完竣、惟兩路局吳淞機廠、則迄今未經交還我方、兩路行車事宜、因此不能早日恢復、查停戰大會小組委員會協定、所有日軍暫駐區域之交通事業、日方不得藉端阻止、兩路當局、爰特函請接管會、要求日方、速將吳淞機廠交還、並於日前、派員與駐防該處之日軍第九師團第九聯隊第三大隊中隊長天野正一接洽、並由日方共同委員會委員原田雄吉、允許於昨日由我方派員視察、詎昨當視察時、日方突然變卦、堅决要我接收、並拒絕於接收前視察、日方此項舉動、實不可解、幾經交涉、旋又於昨晚决定、準我方於今晨十時、先視察後接收、兹將詳情分誌如後、</p>
<p>一度視察被拒　吳淞機廠、爲兩路局修理機件之總機關、其範圍殊廣、所有兩路一切機車機件之修理、俱在該處、當日軍開始撤退時、兩路當局、爲謀早日恢復交通起見、曾屢請接管委員會轉向日方共同委員原田等交涉、迅將該廠交還、詎當時日方、雖允即日交還、惟始終並未確定日期、兩路當局不得已、</p>
<p>乃於本月二十七日、命特派員章學濤·許應聲·莊勤·三人、赴吳淞方面、與駐防該機廠之日軍第九師團第九聯隊第三大隊中隊長天野正一接洽、並擬先行一度視察、詳查内部損壞情形、以便妥籌整理事宜、詎該隊長對於我方人員、嚴辭拒絕、當時表示該處日軍、即將撤退、華方人員、可於接收日前來視察、則較爲簡捷、我方人員、雖經再三交涉、迄無要領、不得已而回滬、</p>
<p>日方允許視察　兩路局人員</p>
<p>旣經被拒、乃將詳情、報告局長陳興漢氏、當由陳氏轉請接管委員會、再向日方交涉、於未接收前、准由我方派員視察、以憑辦理一切、接管委員會據呈後、即向日方共同委員原田雄吉交涉、原田自經我方提出後、立即表示允許、乃書一介紹函、由吾方派員與日中隊長天野接洽、函上並標明准許視察、且鈐原田回章、接管委員會接到該函後、立即通知兩路當局、定昨日下午十時、至該廠視察情形、於是昨日、兩路局人員、偕同接管委員會秘書李暮等、赴該廠視察一切、</p>
<p>昨日視察人員　昨晨九時、兩路局人員以及中英銀公司代表、齊集西愛咸斯路聯社、至九時二十分、乃偕同接管委員會人員、出發視察、接管會方面前往者、計秘書李暮·吳宏·特派員查南强·中英銀公司方面代表爲英人台維生·兩路局方面爲機務處長王繩善·總工程師德施福·機廠廠長毛爾維·鐵道部工務司帮辦孫謀·機務處總監工門司菲爾·機務處職員薛志賢·顔祥生·鄔錦馥·特派員許應聲·章學濤·莊勤·機務處化騐工程師陸寳淦·電氣工程師搿萊等、</p>
<p>日方竟又拒絕　一行視察人員、於十時二十分抵吳淞機廠、當由接管會特派員查南强、路局特派員許應聲、擬即入内、與駐防該廠之日中隊長天野接洽、乃駐廠日軍、堅不放入、不得已、乃出共同委員會日委原田之函、命日兵通報該隊長、詎守候凡三刻鐘、始見廠内派一日軍副官、外出接洽、竟語吾方人員、對視察一事、事前領館方面、並未通知、故表示拒絕入内、並稱、該廠日軍、於昨晚（即前晚）接得日軍部命令、囑將該廠機房、定今日（即昨日）交還華方接管、至駐廠日軍、當於一二日後撤退、吾方人員、當告以今日來此、係屬奉命視察、日軍撤退、事前旣未通知、吾方亦未準備、故堅决要求先行視察、日副官當時、不敢擅專、乃將吾方意旨、入内報告日隊長、凡十分鐘、始行出外、仍堅决拒絕吾方參觀、並謂、該隊自奉命移交後、一切手續、均經辦妥、請前經一度接洽之兩路局特派員許應聲·章學濤·莊勤·三人入内、與日隊長舉行交替手續、關於視察、則儘可於手續辦妥後、再行視察、當時吾方人員、據理力爭、終於不得要領、至十一時三十分、交涉仍無結果、吾方人員曁中央銀公司代表等、疑相率賦歸、詎日中隊長天野、忽親自出外、與吾方商洽、堅决要求吾方於即日接管、當時吾方則以手續尚未辦妥、堅决不允、並質問該隊長、駐廠日軍、究將於何日撤退、日隊長初答以一二日内、繼答在三十一日、語意游移吾方人員、愈覺不解、當語以日軍以未撤前、吾方接管、手續上殊屬困難、詎日隊長不加思索、謂今日（即昨日）華方接管而後、儘可於明日（即今日）派遣警隊、來廠監視、吾方則以此事關係重大、仍不應允、時適接管委員會主任委員殷汝耕氏、在吳淞方面、視察歸來、車過吳淞機廠、見狀停車、詳詢一切、當經詳細報告、殷主任亦以驟然接管、於手續上頗多不便、面諭暫緩視察、由接管會向日方交涉後、再行决定、於是全體視察人員、乃相繼返滬、</p>
<p>日方拒絕用意　查日軍當局、拒絕吾方人員視察、實屬毫無理由、蓋此事、吾方早向日委原田、交涉妥洽、並由原田繕具函件、允許視察、乃該隊長横加阻撓、用意何在、實不可測、查兩路業産、前被日軍大肆破壞、中英銀公司方面、以債權關係、曾向日方交涉賠償、日</p>
<p>方早經應允、兩路業産中之損失最鉅者、當推吳淞機廠、故兩路局方面、於事先須往視察、究竟破壞程度如何、以便報告、乃日方竟不待吾方視察、必須先行接管、其用意所在、當然在避卸責任也、</p>
<p>日方通知撤退　查駐防該廠之日軍、其撤退日期、業經共同委員會日方委員原田、正式通知共同委員會曁吾方委員、定卅一日完全撤退、故吾方特定昨日、前往視察、乃日軍當局、蔑視共同委員會日委之意旨、無端拒絕、誠屬怪事　　交涉再行視察　昨日下午三時許、機務處處長王繩善、復至接管會商議機廠視察問題、當經决定、再行與日方交涉、必須先行視察、而後接管云、</p>
<p>今日視察接收　收據接管會方面消息、昨日共同委員會與日方委員原田、於昨晚八時、雙方商妥、凖於今晨十時先行視察、同日十一時接收、接管會據報後、所有接管該廠人員以及兩路特派員、業定今晨九時、在聯社集合、前往吳淞機廠視察後並接收矣、</p>

<p>北海路同春坊房客、因本市减免房租運動委員會議决、此次滬埠各業、受中日戰事鉅大影響、所有蘇州河以北各處房屋租金、自二月起、要求房主豁免三月、蘇州河以南形勢比較稍佳、則應免租兩月、故該里房客永康號等十七户根據上項决議、與業主華懋地産公司經租人吳高愛爾德洋行交涉、要求將二三兩月概予免除、但該組租者則秉承其業主意旨、謂同春坊地屬中區、絕未受戰事影響、各房客營業、不獨未　損失、且反獲利、遂不允所請、一面延潘士敦等律師向第一特區地方法院起訴、業已審理終結、原定二</p>
<p>十六日宣判、惟届期並未開庭判决、現聞該案且須另行定期重開辯論、良以自减免房租運動發生、中外業主對於減免房租委員會議决免租辦法、多不同意、尤其是蘇州河以南區域、在業主方面、以爲工部局旣不减免稅捐、自亦無免租之必要、一般洋商房東、刻皆視同春坊一案之結果、以作對付房客之準繩、則該案之重要性、不難想象、法院之所以决定再開辯論者、蓋爲愼重起見、俾再聽取雙方之陳述、而予以公允之判斷、倘原被兩造現仍未能在外和平解决、則他日開庭時、産業界將更深切注意、而房客亦愈必出其全力以爭、故當復有一番雄辯也、</p>

<p>十二</p>
<p>大殿的北面是如來佛的寳座。我們在殿之西頭擺了一張八仙棹，兩把交椅，預備給主席和書記坐的。廟裏有二十來條長板凳都搬了出來，横排成七路。小孩子坐在最前列，其次是年表婦女坐，最後是老太婆與年長一些的男子，混雜的坐着。惟獨我們青年男子是享有站有後面的權利。</p>
<p>我先報告：「今天開會宗旨在創辦一個全村人民共同管理的學校。學校爲公是天下爲公的一個基礎。中華民國的主公翁要在做上學，在做上教：學校的主人翁也要在做上學，在做上教。我們今天開會就是請大家來學做學校的老板，學做學校的主人翁。」報告完畢我就說明開會的方法，例如：推舉主席和書記，對準提議案說話不能隨嘴亂說，同時只可由一個人說話，每人說話必須先得主席許可，對於每一提議贊成就舉手，不贊成不舉手，多數舉手就算通過，少數舉手就算失敗，簡便些凡提議無反對者也算通過。這些法子我都扼要的報告給大家聽，並且用淺近的比方表明出來，使得大家能懂。</p>
<p>現在要推主席。我說：一這是一個農村的學校。主席這把交椅只有眞農人能坐。什麽是眞農人？靠自已動手種田吃飯的人是眞農人。我們村莊裏種田種得頂好的無過於黄春生老哥。他爲人公平，熱心，又會說話，我提議請他做主席，贊成不贊成！還有别人要舉嗎？」</p>
<p>衆人說：「春生哥做主席，贊成。」</p>
<p>我說：「凡贊成春生哥做主席的講舉手。」：：：一百零八隻手大多數贊成春生做主席。我是被舉爲書記。</p>
<p>春生哥穿着草鞋，腿上黄泥未乾，走到棹邊就職。他說：「我做這主席眞好像是鄕下人進城第一次吃海參，又想吃又有些害怕。可是我願意試試看。如果做錯了，我就自已睡倒在地上，省得你們來打倒我。好，學堂是要辦的，但是怎樣辦呢？请大家發表意見。」</p>
<p>磚匠老許吃了鎭江醋，一晚酸性未消，氣憤憤的站起來說：「我看學堂是辦不得的。辦了學堂，毁了菩薩，我們靠誰保佑呢？老太太，少奶奶你們不要瞎聽鐘兒的鬼話。辦了學堂，看你們到那裏去燒香？我主張不辦學堂，另外去接一個好的和尚來。」</p>
<p>主席：「老許的話有人贊成嗎？」</p>
<p>「贊成！不辦學堂！」一位雜貨店的老板站起來說。他是顧慮到他的金銀香紙的買賣。</p>
<p>好大的聲勢！出我意料之外，我們今日竟遇着這厲害的勁敵。</p>

<p>— 顧·明·道·</p>
<p>何啞虎。關外鬍匪也。有力如虎。擅槍術。撃無不中。且善馳騁。常執一白蠟竿。夜半潛出盜馬。騰踔而去。追者勿及。以其爲天生啞吧。故有啞虎之名。日軍旣唾手而得遼省。欲遂其吞併满蒙之志。故即以大軍沿錦朝線往龔熱河。朝陽曾一度陷落于日軍之手。甚矣不抵抗之可恥也。於是義勇軍相繼而起。極力遏止日軍之入熱。時施龔撃。飄忽無常。日軍苦之。何啞虎亦揭竿而起。率其部衆。揮戈抗日。一日義勇軍與日軍在熱邊發生激戰。日軍營急遣一聯隊增援。熱邊多高山峻嶺。曲折而幽深。非熟諧地理者弗敢輕入。何啞虎偵知日軍有援。乃率其徒黨數百人。潛伏山中要道。乘夜出撃。自乘駿馬。荷兩槍。大呼殺賊。馳入敵軍。勇如　虎。日軍倉卒應戰。不知敵人多少。紛紛潰亂。何啞虎槍無虚發。殪敵無算。正值深夜。日軍大砲無能施威。遂敗退。何啞虎指揮健兒。奮勇追殺。迨天明。率衆退去。疾如飈風。日軍雖受創。無如之何。知熱河之未可輕侮也。即撤退其軍隊。蓋恐被義勇軍包圍。致有全軍覆没之虞也。勇哉何啞虎。足與小白龍老北風輩同傳矣。</p>

<p>— 譚·冠·翰·</p>
<p>誰也不會相信，在咱們的國土，演述咱們的愛國事情，也要給外國人干預；干預且不足，又任意拘捕，拘捕還未能满意，終以武力將咱們的同胞來屠殺，必令咱們的史册上多一頁恥痕才罷，這是什麽一回事？</p>
<p>唉！想起慘劇的排演，不免令我們對倭寇詛咒，他們旣以經濟手段侵略咱們，在上海開辦工廠，並召致咱們同胞爲他們工作，給他們不勞而逸底吸取咱們無數金錢運往島國，這也不必細論。怎知道他們愈弄愈兇，百般苛待咱們工人，更將同胞顧正紅無理殺戮，還要將他的屍骸葬送於鍋鑪裏面，幸而他家屬得了消息，奔走呼號，總算得了勝利。正紅的遺體，不致化爲灰燼。然而，這慘痛的事實，早激動全國公憤，尤其是當地各團體及學校便相繼組織隊伍出發宣傳，但是，惡狠的日本人，竟敢殺人不許開口，和租界當道商洽，狼狽爲奸，嚴禁咱們的宣傳員在租界呻吟，在十四年五月三十日的那一天，便無理拘捕演說和聽講的咱們同胞，並於南京路上以排槍對咱們民衆屠殺！</p>
<p>唉！所謂「五卅國恥日」，就祇是在這般簡單的輪廓内造成，結果，當局者没有能力將該案圓满解决，每個年頭的今日，仍舊苦着面孔挨度。這一回，越是倍加慘痛，恥辱更甚，日寇以大規模的暴行侵略上海，幸而十九路軍忠勇抗戰，倭寇不能逞所欲爲，可憐咱們小百姓，一向遵從政府受盡屈辱，而始終祇是失望。</p>
<p>至今朝五卅紀念，想當年血痕斑斑，更有那排在我們眼前的一切，愈覺萬分的創痛！</p>

<p>— 鸚·哥·</p>
<p>丨故都雜寫之七丨</p>
<p>正是榴火照眼的時節，吃了隻把紀念屈原死亡的　子，我和諤便一溜烟地趕到北海五龍亭，爲的是今天北海裏有着游艇競賽看，照古例，端午節是應該有龍舟的競渡，可是近年早便不行了，可是不知那一位先生想到用游艇來替代龍舟，游艇的競賽也就算作了龍舟的競渡，這差不多是應用新的形式來表現古代的風俗，這是一件很令人感興的事情。</p>
<p>當我走到五龍亭的時候，講岸上，已經緊緊地擠满了人頭，講水裏，也已羅列了無數的游艇，艇尾冩了數字編號，有的艇上豎了一扇紅旗，上面寫了司令兩字，艇上坐着兩個男子和一個女人，他們都有健康的體格，男的拿着播聲笛，記錄簿，女的拿着三角旗，當這司令艇在水裏活動了一會兒，準備競賽的游艇全部排列到一定的地方，每一個艇上都有健壯的手臂在把握着艇漿，祇等號令的施發便鼓起他們得錦標的勁兒。　　稍待，司令艇上發預備的口令，然後尖聲呌笛一鳴，三角旗一揮，十幾艘游艇全都飛也似的向那長着荷菱水藻的綠波裏滑去，落後的拚命向前去，在前的努力不使落後，就這樣游艇漸漸地遠去，結果好像一羣浮在水面的黑鴨，可是岸上的觀衆依然張大了嘴，出神地注望着。</p>
<p>大概過了二十分鐘的樣子，三號游艇首先到達了終點，游手是一個廣東籍的學生，一時在岸的許多廣東人全都把他抬得高高的照了一個相，後到的許多艇兒全都頽傷地垂下了雙漿，惟有倒數第一的那艘紅色的游艇，雖然在别的艇兒全都到達終點的時候還在中途摇晃着身子，可是游手並不因此便灰心，他還是照樣地在努力着，好像後面還有艇兒要趕上前來似的並不鬆懈他漿兒的動蕩，結果，他終於在人們的譏笑聲中到了終點，也没有一個人歡迎他，將他抱起照一個相，但是他自已却很愉快地躍了一會才把衣服穿起，是的，照他那樣精神，在不久的將來他是能夠得着錦標的</p>

<p>兩位盲目女詩人倫敦王家師範學校Ｒoyal　Normal　School中。有兩位女學生。一名馬格蘭白朗。Margaret　Brand一名瓊痕郝來德。Joan　Hewlett一樣是威爾士人。一樣是十七歲。又一樣是盲子。二人同出同入。同游同息。共同研究學問。而暗中却在學業上競爭得很厲害。各不相下。彼此的心中。都以彼此爲勁敵。最近英國國家學院中。舉行全世界英文文藝大比賽。其乙組中以詩歌得第一第二奬金的。就是這兩位盲目女詩人。馬格蘭得第一名。伊的詩呌做「一個夢」。瓊痕得第二名。伊的詩呌做「我瞧見的是甚麽」。公布以後。傳誦一時。現在二人都在牛津大學。仍在孜孜向學。企圖得一個最榮譽的學位。這兩個女孩子。眞所謂盲於目不盲於心了。</p>
<h3 id="c158">蘇俄生活程度一斑（上） <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 墨·逸·</p>
<p>這是一封從莫斯科寄出來的信。寫信的人似乎是一圙俄國人。他把俄國近來的生活都很忠誠的告訴了我們，但他是以不满意的態度寫這封信的，所以字裏行間都充满了感着痛苦的語氣。全文載於十五日上海法文報。譯者識</p>
<p>我現在雖然寄這封描寫俄國生活的信給你們，但是能否遞到你們手中，還不敢預料。因爲這兒秘密的通信法，已經像其他一切的秘密一樣完全揭破了。這封信當然也得經過檢查者的眼睛，所以扣留與否，我是不敢想像它了。</p>
<p>我乃是屬於第二類工人。每月所得的領物證，能換取一　囉格蘭姆糖，五百格蘭姆凈麥或麫條，三百格蘭姆肉；過幾時得二百五十格蘭姆肥皂；每日得四百格蘭姆黑麫包，這種麫包裏面，含有荳和蕃薯約百分之五十。因爲莫斯科是俄國政治中心，有很多的外國人住着，所以公務人員和小孩子能得到白麫包。</p>
<p>其餘一切應用的東西，都得到國有的商店去購買，但它的代價之高和我們的收入絕對不能成正比例。平均我們每月的薪俸自五十至二百羅卜，最高三百羅卜，但必須兼職。而各物的市價如下；奶油每𠼻囉格蘭姆價二十五至三十羅卜；牛乳每公升價三羅卜；蛋每十隻價七羅卜；牛每𠼻囉格蘭姆價六至八羅卜；猪肉每𠼻囉格蘭姆價十五羅卜；火腿，熟肉，水菓和蔬菜之類是買不到的。檸檬在數月前每隻售四羅卜；家用肥皂每塊價二至八羅卜。衣服除了工廠裏的特許人員可以領取外，其餘的人一律須到舊衣市塲以驚人的代價去自購的。例如絲圍巾每條價須五十至一百羅卜，其他就可見一斑了。</p>
<p>由此便可想見我們月入一百五十至二百羅卜的生活的種種了。尤其是鞋子，更使我們感覺着痛苦。政府把鞋子盡量的賣到外國去，本國却常常缺乏鞋子，甚至没有鞋穿，假使外國人把我們銷出的貨物，因爲惡劣而退還，那我們就快樂極了，雖然要以一百七十羅卜去買一雙鞋子，但是總不至於有赤脚的虞了。</p>

<p>到了葉宅。仍逕奔五太太上房。五太太親身在臥室外間那個私人專用的小客室招待。見了安玉田。就很親熱的呌妹夫。又對梁笑雲極誇讚這妹夫的人品。安玉田偷眼看那五太太。此時大概正在梳妝的半腰裏。臉上雖已塗满一層極厚重的白粉。其餘畫眉點唇的細緻工夫。還未完備。兩頰上也尚缺少兩塊小桃形的胭脂色澤。被電燈光那麽一反映。白裏帶青。青裏帶白。活像戲台上的司馬懿。令人看了渾身起栗。不由趕忙低下頭來。又苦於應對的侷促。幸五太太也忙着要修飾。鬧了一陣。就將梁笑雲拖進屋裏去。只命毛德順留在這裏招待安玉田。教安玉田這才覺得還是毛德順好說話呢。又消磨了約莫兩個小時。這一行列才齊湧現在大舞台的二樓上。五太太儀態萬方的走在最前頭。一身的濃妝𧰚服。寳氣珠光。已成爲衆人注目的最精緻的藝術品。梁笑雲緊跟在後面。論豐姿雖有目共賞。益見嬌麗。但不知怎的。一屈居在五太太的肩下。氣概便總得讓人一籌。不能那麽飛揚活躍。再往後。便是那形容羞澀步履蹒跚的安玉田。和戎裝顯赫軍靴蹀𨇾的毛德順了。踱到東邊第三個包廂。五太太與梁笑雲携手同到前面一排座位上。並肩而坐。雖旁邊究還有兩隻空椅子。五太太也曾對安玉田虚讓了一聲。但梁笑雲急忙使了個眼色。安玉田隨即也知道不宜那麽隨便放肆有礙觀瞻。略遜謝了幾名。不迭的只往後退。對不住。惟有高高的坐在包廂中第二層椅位上。去與毛副官爲伍。儼然也像個貴婦人身後的隨從侍衛了。好在此來非爲看戲。只爲利見大人。不妨將就些時。靜候毛德順行事。</p>

<p>— 佛·</p>
<p>昨據北平電，溥儀前密電平某前清貴胄，覓得太監二十六名，密送長春，昨返平二十一名，餘五名溥儀自出資留用。</p>
<p>御用太監之制，原係專制時代惟一的惡例，溥儀名爲執政，未稱僞帝，刑餘太監，本不適用。</p>
<p>并且满洲係少爺國，一切經濟收支，全由老爺支配，溥儀未經後臺老閭允許，擅自招置太監，溥儀之「不識相」，於此可見。</p>
<p>特以類聚，同氣相求，溥儀之與太監，名目雖異，事實則同，試舉其例，可無發噱。</p>
<p>太監名爲男性，而實無陽具，溥儀名爲執政，而其實無權，其同一。太監爲溥之奴隸，而溥儀爲日人之奴隸，其同二。</p>
<p>太監係僱用性質，而溥儀亦係僱用性質，觀其自出資留用五名可見，其同三。</p>
<p>溥儀在此日人愚弄之下，至今還不覺悟，再去碰這頂子，鄭孝胥「不識相」，吃了個大耳括子，鄭垂「不識相」，吃了東洋來路的槍柄，溥儀你「識相」些罷！</p>

<p>— 惟·申·</p>
<p>雪花膏功能滋潤股膚，滑而不膩，香而不俗，故人都樂用；但市上西洋貨較多，價格頗昻，國貨出品，近年來大有進步，足以挽回利權，今余於校中試製，成績尚稱不劣，敢錄之以供讀者諸君一試。</p>
<p>原料及分量：</p>
<p>斯替林（Stearine）：：：十克（Io　　grams）</p>
<p>炭酸鈉（SodiumCarbonate）：：：　　一克Igram）</p>
<p>甘油（Glycerine）：：：二方立糎（2　　CCH）</p>
<p>黑斯林水（azelWater）：：：十立　　方糎（IOCC）</p>
<p>蒸水（DistilledWater）：：：一　　百方（ooCC）</p>
<p>玫瑰麝香油（西名不詳）：：：少量以上各物均可自化學工業原料社購買。</p>
<p>用具：</p>
<p>大蒸發皿一只，筷一只，酒精燈及鐵架鐵網各一，天平及量杯各一。</p>
<p>製法：先將斯替林十克，研成細粉，另量蒸餾水一百立方糎，傾注蒸發皿内，乃以一克炭酸鈉溶入，就酒精燈上加熱，待其溶盡後，即將研成之斯替林粉微微加入，一手以筷攪之，設白沫欲溢，則可暫將燈移去：但須從速放回，此時仍須攪拌，不可稍歇，斯替林加完後，繼續攪拌，迄呈乳白色半液狀態，方可離火待冷，至其稍凉，注以黑斯林水十立方糎，拌之使匀，冷却後再加甘油二立方糎矺及玫瑰麝香油三四滴而使和，由是雪花膏告成矣！</p>
<p>註：玫瑰麝香油須先溶於酒精内，（完）</p>

<p>— 吾·</p>
<p>隔别了九年簡直不通音問的老友，今天能夠偶然的在馬路上重新會晤，這對我眞是值得過分喜悅的了。當我仔細的認清了眞的是他的時候，我急忙的以整個的熱情緊握着他的手。我顫抖的說：</p>
<p>「啊！原來是你啊！：：你：：你簡直老得使我不能認識了。你還認記得我嗎？」</p>
<p>他半嚮不曾說話，他只是以瘋狂的眼光注視着我。許久，然後再無力的低下頭去，低微的似乎是在對他自已訴說：</p>
<p>「是的，：：啊！你也還是活着的！：：：哼！你也老了，我們都老了。」</p>
<p>「可不是嗎？我們都老了喲！」</p>
<p>由於他的談話中，我知道他早已在ＸＸ路軍服務，而且這一次並參加了最光榮的上海戰爭。這使我對他竭誠的敬佩，因爲在他的相形之下，我覺得過於渺小。不是嗎？對於這偉大的戰士，我有什麽理由不當慚愧呢？但是他的疲憊的精神也夠使我憂慮，於是不得不冒昧問他說：</p>
<p>「朋友！我看你是非常消極呢？你能告訴我嗎？」</p>
<p>「消極嗎？是的，我很消極！但是我什麽不消極呢？譬如說罷，我這次懷着满腔的憤怒來和帝國主義拚頭顱，我满想在這次流血中能夠將中華民族脫出重重的壓迫，可是事實怎樣？朋友！事實怎樣呢？你以爲眞的是我們敗北嗎？好罷！由他們說去罷。：：：啊！我怎能不消極呢？」</p>
<p>我没有適當的言詞可以回答他，我只有怔怔的望着他的臉。其後他又接着說：</p>
<p>朋友！你該知道吧，我們這軍隊又要去「ＸＸ」了。自然，權威者自會有新的宣言，新的口號，自然是出師有名，自然會解說「這次出師確有重大的意義」：但是所給與我的是什麽呢？這只有我自已知道：：：啊！我還有什麽有說呢？：：：」</p>
<p>他的眼睛裏噴着火光，極重的憶怒充满了他的胸堂。最後他再嗄着喉音說：</p>
<p>他們又要我殺中國人去，殺中國人去！然而我將怎樣？我將怎樣呢？：：：：」</p>
<p>以後我們終於分别了。我覺得心頭特别沉重。我謹祝福他前途珍重。</p>

<h3 id="c163">午飯後的一刻鐘内 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 飢·腦·</p>
<p>吃罷了午飯，走出辦公室，向着辦公室隣近的幾條馬路上去閑蕩，看看櫉窗内陳列着花花綠綠燿目的貨品，以調劑調劑困坐在辦公室内付案埋頭的沉悶的機械生活，</p>
<p>我穿過南京路，路上的汽車黄包車等車輛，似黄浦江裏潮水般的疾駛，駛向他們的住宅，預備去進他們的午飯，在水門汀的行人道上，也三三兩兩的放大了步子向前推進，各人的面上，都浮堆着一種表情，一種神態，似乎是在告訴人們，我們將去吃飯，</p>
<p>在一條弄堂口，過街樓的下面，三四個年輕力壯的乞兒，守候着挑了一付飯擔從弄堂内走向外面來的包飯作裏的老司務，想等那擔飯老司務經過他們面前時，傾倒些人家所吃剩下的殘羹冷飯，充飢果腹，</p>
<p>一個穿著十九世紀式的襤褸衣衫的江北行乞婦，像角黍般的一雙小脚，支撑住了她的全身力量，從一條總弄的支弄裏，似餓鷹撲兎般的一摇一擺，緊尾在挑飯司務的後面，也希冀將飯擔上剩餘的冷飯殘羹，傾倒到她手提的鉛鉢中，配合成一種百汁粥或是百汁飯，</p>
<p>守望在過家樓下的乞兒，各個三脚兩步的飛奔前去，其勢洶洶，頓現出一種好似割據一方的軍閥吃相，在無聲的話語中，暗示出一種意思，好似在說，此乃我們的行乞地域，行乞的勢力範圍，任何行乞者不得侵犯，結果，江北婦也默認他們是當地的乞閥，不得不垂頭喪氣的向後便走，讓乞閥們將殘羹冷飯倒去圍聚大嚼一頓，慶賞他們的勝利，　　包飯作挑擔的老司務，站立著等他們搶殘羹冷飯的工作完畢後，仍舊嬾洋洋的挑了空擔走出弄堂，</p>
<p>管弄堂的巡捕，也好似早和三四個年輕力壯的乞兒妥協，默認他們的舉動是合法，而不加以絲毫的干涉，</p>

<p>— 澤·永·</p>
<p>昨天我看見了祺華君作的大律師一文，因而想起我的兩個朋友的離案，頗有一述的價值，</p>
<p>第一位朋Ｋ君的夫人Ｓ女士，因不满Ｋ君的待遇，要與他離婚，但是實際上，Ｋ君待遇Ｓ女士，却也很是不差，不過是Ｋ君經濟力薄弱，没有給她揮霍爽快罷了，所以Ｓ女士到Ｘ律師事務所去，接洽離婚的事宜，</p>
<p>「因爲我的丈夫，屢次虐待我，並且無力瞻養，所以請貴律師辦理離婚手續，」這Ｓ女士對Ｘ律師說的話，</p>
<p>「旣然如此、那末Ｋ先生家産有多少？每月幾何薪水？」Ｘ律師笑着問，　　Ｓ女士說：「慚愧得很，他每月祇有三十多元一月薪水，至於家産，更不足道了！」</p>
<p>Ｘ律師聽了，不覺皺了皺眉頭，露出很不高興的樣子說：「Ｓ女士！我想還是不離爲妙吧！因爲證據很不充足，並且我們做律師的，不能夠把人家的伉儷，生生的離開，女士若可忍耐，務請忍耐，切不可鹵莽從事，」</p>
<p>Ｓ女士聽了，祇是低了頭，回答不出一句話來，</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>第二位朋友Ｄ君，他的夫人Ｗ女士</p>
<p>，她因自已有了外遇，聽從了奸夫的慫恿，便到Ｃ律師事務所，請他代辦Ｄ君離婚的事件，Ｄ君本來是很愛Ｗ女士的，萬不料她會有這麽一着的變化，</p>
<p>Ｗ女士對Ｃ律師說：「我的丈夫因有外遇，所以我要和他離婚，」</p>
<p>不料那位Ｃ律師所問出來的話，竟同前一位Ｘ律師的話一樣的，他不待聽完，便很急的問Ｗ女士道：</p>
<p>Ｄ先生每月可有多少薪水？家資豐富嗎？」</p>
<p>「他嗎！每月的薪水約有五百元，</p>
<p>而家資：：：」</p>
<p>Ｃ律師不待Ｗ女士說完，摸着嘴唇上的仁丹式胡髭，哈哈的笑說道：</p>
<p>「Ｗ女士：請你放心吧，Ｄ先生這樣的無情無義，本律師當依法辦理：：：：：：」</p>
<p>於是Ｗ女士聽了，便笑着臉回去了！</p>
<p>電影</p>
<p>— 「亡國恨」</p>
<p>提起「賓漢」（ＢＥＮＨＵＲ）這個名頭來、恐怕喜歡看看影戲的朋友、没有一個不知道吧、因爲這本片子、在無聲影片盛行的時候、不但轟動一時、並且無論那家戯院、開映此片、莫不利市三倍、當然、像這樣片子、費了三年的光隂和四百萬美金的資本、再加上十五萬演員、試問在所有影片中、有幾部能花去這樣大的本錢呢、可是現在又來了一個更好的消息了、就是米曲羅公司、已將此片翻成有聲拷貝、出而問世、英文名稱還是（ＢＲＮＨＵＲ）、不過中文名稱、聽說因爲電影檢查會的命令、改爲「亡國恨」、並聞自今天起已在國泰大戯院公映滬人影迷、聽見這個消息、也許要歡喜得跳起來吧、</p>

<p>Since this newspaper successively published three commentaries on the 12th, 13th, and 14th of this month, namely, "On Resuming Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union and Preventing Communism," "Discussing Sino-Soviet Diplomatic Relations from the Perspective of the International Situation," and "A Third Commentary on Sino-Soviet Diplomatic Relations," proposing the resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, there has been a significant response from society. Simultaneously, the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao also published a commentary titled "The Issue of Resuming Diplomatic Relations between China and Russia" on the 14th of this month, followed by another commentary on the 19th titled "Revisiting the Issue of Resuming Diplomatic Relations with Russia." On the 16th of this month, the Peiping Chen Pao published a commentary titled "Clarifying Resumption of Diplomatic Relations with Russia," and on the same day, the Tianjin Yi Shih Pao also published a commentary titled "Sino-Russian Diplomatic Relations." Based on an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages and the demands of the situation, all advocated for the immediate resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. However, on the other hand, thoughtful individuals are deeply concerned about the communist propaganda that would follow the resumption of relations, and opposition has been persistent. We believe that this issue is of utmost importance. Facts become clearer through research, and theories become more accurate through debate. We deeply respect the opinions of those who oppose it, but at the same time, we must clarify the rights and wrongs. We now address the concerns of those who oppose resuming diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union based on our observations.</p>
<p>The opinions of those who oppose it often seem to be emotional and extreme, lacking calm, rational, and practical arguments. For instance, some say that advocating for resuming diplomatic relations is like hoping for others to help in an emergency, or that those who advocate for resuming diplomatic relations seem to believe that resuming diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union is China's only way out today, or that the Soviet Union's consistent policy is to break down national borders and create an absolute dictatorship of a very small number of people. These are all peripheral issues and mostly speculative. In reality, we only believe that resuming diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union is a normal diplomatic relationship, and we do not hope that others will "draw their swords to help when they see injustice." We further believe that resuming diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union is comparatively advantageous, and we never believed that it is China's only way out today. Besides these points, the most significant reason they hold is that communism is a destructive force. The past tolerance of communism has already created the current situation where communist forces are spreading across the country. If we resume diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union today, giving them convenient opportunities for propaganda, the future will be even more unthinkable. This seems to be the case, but it is not.</p>
<p>We believe that before discussing this issue, we must recognize that "resuming diplomatic relations," "allying with the Soviet Union," and "tolerating communism" are three different things and should not be conflated. "Resuming diplomatic relations" is not "allying with the Soviet Union," and certainly not "tolerating communism." It is merely restoring normal diplomatic relations. This is common knowledge, and we should not have any misunderstandings. To say that resuming diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union will give the Communist Party more opportunities for propaganda and activity, allowing the Communist Party's power to grow even more, well, we have already severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union for four years, yet the Communist Party has not disappeared as a result. On the contrary, its power has grown. Furthermore, the northern regions that border the Soviet Union have fewer communist guerrillas, while the communist forces in the southern provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian are rampant. From this, we can see that severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union may not prevent communism, and resuming diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union may not expand the Communist Party. The core of the problem lies in whether China has soil suitable for communism and whether there are opportunities for communism to spread. If we have it, what is the benefit of severing diplomatic relations? If we don't have it, what harm is there in resuming diplomatic relations? Ignoring the root of the problem and trying to prevent the influx of communism with a closed-door policy—is it possible to prevent insects from growing in something that is already rotten, even if it is placed in an iron box? To say that "China lacks a strong unified government," "strict social organization," "stable people's lives," and "the ability to control communists," therefore, we should not follow the example of the great powers in opening our doors and allowing "those who plot red terror" to come and go freely—this implies that we have already recognized that China is the most suitable soil for communism. If China has this soil, even without the Soviet Union, it is difficult to guarantee that revolutionary events will not erupt. Historical upheavals are well-documented. Without improving internal affairs and stabilizing people's livelihoods, and trying to use severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union as a means to prevent chaos from sprouting—isn't this perspective too skewed?</p>
<p>To say that the Soviet Union may not be a nation that treats us equally, so we don't need to resume diplomatic relations with them—which of the major powers currently treats us equally? Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has been aggressively invading us, placing us on the brink of life and death, yet we have not dared to sever diplomatic relations with them. Why do we treat the Soviet Union as a destructive force that cannot be approached? To say that resuming diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union is clearly joining the communist camp and declaring war on imperialists, which will provoke the resentment of the major powers—this is also overly apprehensive. Question: aside from the United States, which is still considering resuming diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, all the other major powers have already resumed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. What reason is there to forbid us from resuming diplomatic relations? Moreover, the power of diplomacy should be in our own hands. Simply following the will of others is hardly the way to establish a nation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we sincerely hope that people of vision in the country will discuss this issue calmly and practically, without merely expressing emotional sentiments or being confined by preconceived notions, viewing the Soviet Union as unapproachable. Capitalist powers are also changing their past views of the Soviet Union. We cannot continue to uphold the claims of conservatives unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Ju Zheng Painfully Discusses the Many Calamities Facing the Nation <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ju Zheng stated that China has suffered from natural and man-made disasters every year, leading to a decrease in population. According to recent reports, more than 20 counties in northern Anhui are currently under the ravages of communist bandits, and the people are suffering greatly, struggling to survive. Although there are no exact figures for the number of victims, it is certainly not small. If we extrapolate to southern Fujian, Hubei, and Jiangxi, the banditry and natural disasters that have been encountered for years, the deaths, migrations, and exiles are even more incalculable. For example, the population of Shaanxi was previously said to be more than one million, but according to current estimates, it is only more than six hundred thousand, a decrease of nearly one-third. By analogy, the Chinese population is only two to three hundred million. If this continues, the rate of population decline will be even more unthinkable. But to say that the cause of such a tragic situation is simply poverty, because it is forced by special rulers, and has to be done. Counting the provinces that are now planting opium poppies, except for Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shandong, and Hebei, almost every other province has it. The other day, I went to a certain place. According to farmers, several counties that plant poppies are forced to collect hundreds of thousands or even millions of yuan in opium seedling taxes. If we extrapolate to the province, the amount is simply over ten million, which is truly shocking. Farmers also said that the cost of planting poppies in terms of labor and fertilizer is several times higher than that of planting food crops, and that land that has been planted with poppies is difficult to grow food crops on later. Therefore, after being forced to plant, they are forced to buy and smoke, and after being forced to smoke, they are fined, and after being fined, they are imprisoned. These things are simply unspeakable. We people in politics should not say these things, losing the face of the Chinese people and making foreigners look down on us even more. I ask myself if I have been out of line, but if the people have suffering and do not know it, or know it but do not speak out, the blame is equal. Now, to provide relief, the first is to hope that the special political classes in each province will consider the suffering of the people, reduce military spending, and only plant opium poppies. If the special military and political classes can truly make a great wish to prohibit planting, and say that the people still dare to break the law and plant deliberately, I do not believe it.

<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news: recently, many Chinese and foreign newspapers have reported on the tense situation between Japan and Russia. Although the Japanese and Russian diplomatic authorities have repeatedly clarified, all parties still feel that both sides have made some preparations. Incontestably, yesterday the United Kingdom and the United States obtained a contrary message, stating that Stimson had failed to meet with Litvinov in Europe, and that the Japanese side believed that there was an opportunity to contact Russia. Udagaki dispatched personnel to Russia to continue the failed policy of alliance with Russia pursued by Taro Katsura and Goto Shinpei.

<h3 id="e34">Tang Ke San Receives Capital Press <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Reports on the Mediation of the Kang-Tibetan Dispute</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Ke San received the press on the 29th and reported on the mediation of the Kang-Tibetan dispute, stating that before the authorities ordered him to set off, the Dalai Lama had cabled the central government, expressing his willingness to withdraw his troops immediately and await the central government's resolution of the Da Bai case. However, when he arrived in Chengdu, the Tibetan army suddenly occupied Ganzi and captured Luhuo and Henghua Qiaojing. Ke San immediately negotiated the Da Bai case and asked the Sichuan army to provide military backing, but this was not permitted by the facts. He met with Galun Aphe, the Dalai Lama's representative, outside the pass. Since the reach was too far, they procrastinated and were insincere. He secretly cabled the central government, asking the Sichuan military authorities and the Qinghai and Yunnan provinces, as well as the Xikang militia, to prepare to respond with force. Just as the Northeast Incident occurred, the central government, wanting to avoid worries in the west, telegraphed Ke Er, urging him to seek a temporary conclusion as soon as possible, discuss the Da Bai case first, and handle other issues separately. Therefore, he had no choice but to follow the central government's instructions and sacrifice his personal opinions. He negotiated ten truce conditions with the Tibetan side, which had been approved by the Executive Yuan, but the Tibetan side suddenly reneged and then received a central telegram ordering a temporary delay. The Gan case was entrusted to Liu Wenhui to handle, and Ke San was ordered to return to Beijing to report. He packed his bags and returned east, arriving in Beijing on the 20th of this month. He has now received a Sichuan telegram stating that Ganzi has been occupied by the Sichuan army, but the Dajin Temple, an important base for the Tibetan army, is still resisting desperately, hoping to counterattack. Therefore, they urgently hope that the Sichuan army will take advantage of the situation to advance and capture the Dajin Temple as soon as possible, so that the Tibetan army will inevitably be discouraged and negotiations will be able to yield. As for the people of Xikang, since the Republic of China, our government officials have failed to provide effective protection and have been ravaged by Tibetan bandits, suffering greatly. Their desire to return to the Han is extremely urgent. This time, when Ke San passed through Kang, many people from Kang came from afar to welcome him, tearfully recounting their oppression and expressing their sincerity in leaning towards the central government, hoping to be appeased. He comforted them with gentle words, telling them that the central government would not easily abandon Xikang and would not despise the interests of the people of Kang, and that there would soon be a fundamental appeasement policy. The people of Kang were very grateful. If the government can make good use of the psychology of the people of Kang and properly determine a border pacification plan, then even if the Tibetan bandits are cunning, it will not be difficult to make them fear.

<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 29th - The Japanese military has decided on the draft of the new Manchurian-Mongolian governance policy. It is said that it will be submitted to the Cabinet Council at the 62nd National Diet. Its content includes abolishing the Four-Headed Politics, newly establishing a Governor-General's Office, appointing an active-duty army general as Governor-General, abolishing the Director-General of the Kwantung Government, and requiring consuls to be under the command of the Governor-General.

<p>Selecting Government Officials Causes Problems</p>
<p>Difficult to Implement Purification of the Political World</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - The Seiyukai and Minseito parties have different opinions on the issue of government officials, which is bound to cause disputes. Interior Minister Yamamoto does not approve of the parties of ministers and government officials being different, saying that it will hinder national affairs. He is also taking a tough stance on the position of Vice Minister of the Interior, not complying with the Seiyukai's request. On the other hand, President Suzuki visited Prime Minister Saito at 9:00 this morning, expressing that the Seiyukai's opinion must be adopted for the Vice Minister of the Interior. Later, Prime Minister Saito discussed the matter with Chief Secretary Shibata and invited Izawa Takiio to present the Seiyukai's opinion, engaging in earnest discussions. After Izawa met with Prime Minister Saito, he visited Interior Minister Yamamoto and discussed the matter with each other. However, at the moment when the national unity cabinet has just been formed, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties are actually in such opposition, so Prime Minister Saito feels very difficult to handle this situation, and fears that it will not be easy to resolve.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - Regarding the Seiyukai's selection policy for government officials, President Suzuki, Secretary-General Yamaguchi, and others decided on the following fundamental policy as a result of discussions at 2:00 PM yesterday: (1) The Seiyukai must send out at least 20 government officials. If the Minseito party requests 8, then based on the proportion of members, the request will be increased by 1 or 2. (2) The Vice Minister of the Interior must be selected by the Seiyukai no matter what, so the Vice Minister of Finance can be conceded, but the Financial Councilor must still be selected by the Seiyukai. Minister of Railways Tsuchiya took this policy with him and visited Prime Minister Saito last night, seeking his understanding. Saito replied that he would solicit the opinions of the Minseito party before making a decision at the Cabinet meeting. However, within the Cabinet, Interior Minister Yamamoto stated that from now on, political and administrative affairs will be clearly distinguished, and personnel transfers will not allow government officials to intervene. Therefore, the Seiyukai's government officials are acceptable, and the Minseito party's are also acceptable. However, the Minseito party has consistently opposed the Seiyukai's opinion, so the two factions have become opposed in the selection of government officials. Disputes are bound to arise in the Cabinet meetings on the 30th and 31st because of this.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - In order to revitalize the politics of political parties and bureaucrats, and to implement the purification of the political world, Interior Minister Yamamoto intends to distinguish between political and administrative affairs at the time of the establishment of this national cabinet, to make it impossible for political parties to intervene. In order to establish the long-standing guarantee of status for administrative officials and police, he will gradually evaluate and select local officials with this policy, centering on the official position. On the one hand, he has decided to advise Prime Minister Saito to implement the bill to guarantee the status of officials.</p>

<p>Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - The National Japanese Party, organized by Akamatsu, Shimonaka, and others who withdrew from the Masses Party, held its founding ceremony at 1:00 PM yesterday. However, at the preparatory council in the morning, Akamatsu and Shimonaka had fierce discussions due to the issue of changing the party name and the issue of executive committee members. At 2:30 PM, the Shimonaka faction angrily withdrew from the meeting, so the Akamatsu faction announced the dissolution of the party.</p>

<p>No Achievements to Speak Of</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 28th - Since the opening of the Disarmament Conference, there have been no achievements to speak of. However, according to observers, the conference will continue to be discussed this summer and will not be adjourned due to the summer heat. Furthermore, when discussing the future results of the conference, the future is felt to be vague. Each country holds its own views and will not compromise. Therefore, the establishment of complete understanding is already a fantasy, and even the reasonable compromise of all parties is impossible. Compared with the past, it feels like it is getting worse every day. Although the situation is so dangerous, each country is still unwilling to give up its hypocrisy, and anyone who proposes to adjourn the meeting is opposed by all parties, saying that it should wait for the international situation to gradually ease before proceeding slowly. Today, U.S. President's representative and Ambassador to Belgium, Gibson, revisited the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, and stated the U.S. government's opinion that the conference should continue in order to achieve a real effect. Representatives of other countries also made the same request after Gibson. Therefore, world disarmament is likely to continue to be held in the hot summer.</p>

<p>Prime Minister to Concurrently Serve as Foreign Minister</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 28th - According to the list of the new French cabinet circulated in political circles in recent days, Radical Party leader Herriot seems to have given up his previous proposal to handle foreign affairs exclusively and not serve as Prime Minister. He will serve as Prime Minister and concurrently serve as Foreign Minister, and will accept the new mandate to form a cabinet on Monday, and will announce its formation on the same day. As for the other cabinet members, Stieger and Satun have the highest voice for Minister of the Interior, Panleve may be asked to serve as Minister of War. Mr. Panleve has previously served as Minister of War, so he can handle it with ease. In addition, it is said that Salo will serve as Minister of the Navy or Minister of Colonial Affairs, Daladier will serve as Minister of Aviation, and Balmed will likely serve as Minister of Finance. Senator Gata will likely accept the Minister of Budget, but this list is all based on the Socialists not joining the cabinet. If Heleo can persuade the Socialists to join the cabinet, then more important departments will be assigned to important Socialists.</p>

<p>Ingenious Fire Starting and Escaping from Danger</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th - Two British aviators went out for a flight yesterday and were forced to land on a beach in the Wash Sea due to engine damage. The aircraft was destroyed and could not be repaired. They were surrounded by water, with no end in sight. There was no way to call for help. The two men took off their clothes and tried to swim to the coast, which was five miles away, but the waves were treacherous and they were eventually driven back. At this time, their clothes on the beach had been washed away by the tide. They had no matches and no way to start a fire to signal for help. They took the lens of the camera and tried to use sunlight to start a fire to burn the mat that had been soaked in gasoline, but it was ineffective. The two men were extremely anxious. Finally, one person turned the pusher in the plane, and the other person stood beside the magneto generator holding the mat, hoping to generate fire by friction. After an hour and a half, the tide had risen to the top of the beach. Suddenly, a spark ignited the grass mat, and soon the flames were blazing, visible in the distance. A motor merchant ship happened to pass by, saw the fire and came to inspect. At this point, the two aviators, who were stranded on a deserted beach in the sea and had no clothes on, were rescued. One of them, Scott, is the secretary of a British aviation club.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Military Administration Plan Implemented in the Hawaiian Islands <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The United States Deploys War Preparations in the Pacific</p>
<p>140,000 Japanese Immigrants Suddenly Panic</p>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported that the Chairman of the U.S. House Naval Affairs Committee, Britten, submitted the military administration bill for the Hawaiian Islands. This bill is to contain the natives and other forces. At the same time, because the islands are the first line of defense for the U.S. Pacific coast, their military significance is very important. Britten said that in the event of a war in the Pacific, the position of the Hawaiian Islands is the same as that of Heligoland Island in the North Sea during the European War (this fortress was dismantled after the war and was originally the gateway to Hamburg, Germany, when the Elbe River was hit). If the fortress is not destroyed or the naval base is captured, it will be difficult for the enemy to approach the U.S. mainland.</p>
<p>The Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun said that U.S. House Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Britten submitted the military administration bill for the Hawaiian Islands on the 18th in preparation for war in the Pacific. The contents of the bill are as follows: "With the consent of the Senate, the President is granted the authority to appoint active-duty army and naval officers as Governor and Secretary of the Hawaiian Islands." Britten also explained the reasons for the proposal, saying, "In the future, the lives of the American people will be determined by the military operations around the Hawaiian Islands. I expect the day to determine life will come, so the Hawaiian Islands must be completely placed under the military rule of the United States. It is extremely dangerous to entrust such an important territory to the natives for control. Once a war breaks out in the Pacific, the Hawaiian Islands will be the Heligoland fortress of the United States. If the enemy does not destroy the defenses of Honolulu and the naval base, they will not be able to advance eastward. In the past, there have been homicides in Honolulu, and the natives in general have expressed dissatisfaction. Therefore, in this area, in order to fully protect the rights and interests of American citizens and Americans, the Hawaiian Islands should be under the direct control of the United States. The Hawaiian Islands and the Panama Canal are the most important outposts for U.S. national defense." The Honolulu Telegraph also stated that since the Magichi homicide occurred, the United States has advocated the implementation of an armed forces bill in the Hawaiian Islands. The real meaning of the bill is that a Pacific war is expected to break out, and it is extremely dangerous from a national defense point of view if the Hawaiian Islands are placed under Japanese control. At present, 140,000 Japanese immigrants residing in Hawaii panicked upon hearing the news of the implementation of military administration, and said that the Japanese-American war is getting closer and closer.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Guizhou Province Troop Movements <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Arriving at the Guangdong-Guizhou Border to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Li Bai Inspects Various Troops</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The political situation in the Southwest remains chaotic recently. Li Zongren has not returned to Guangdong since returning to Guizhou from Guangdong. Therefore, the trend of Guizhou Province's attitude is particularly relevant to the overall situation in the Southwest. At the same time, important figures from various parties are also flocking to Guizhou one after another. Wu Qiwai, Deputy Commander of the Fourth Army, after moving his troops into Hunan and being ordered to cooperate in suppressing the Communist bandits, returned to Guizhou from Liling defense earlier this month to ask Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi and others for advice. Wu's Fourth Army was once affiliated with Li Bai's Fourth Army Group, and although it restored the independent system of the Fourth Army after leaving Guizhou, it was still necessary to maintain contact with the Guizhou Army, so Wu personally returned to Guizhou. After Wu met with Li Bai, he returned to Hunan from Yong on the ninth of this month and led his troops into Jiangxi. However, on the Guangdong Province side, Deng Ziru also went to Nanning in person under the guise of running industries in Guizhou and held multiple talks with Bai Chongxi and others. After Deng returned, Wu Chaochu, Cheng Tiangu, Luo Yiqun, Ye Gongchuo, and others from the 55 Traveling Group took the opportunity to visit Guilin's scenery and visit the Guizhou authorities along the way. Deng, Wu and others have now returned to Guangdong one after another. Deng was tight-lipped about his mission to Guizhou, and Wu and others also made no formal statements. Only Luo Yiqun published a conversation about his tour of Guizhou in the newspaper, without mentioning a word about politics, but praised the rapid progress of construction in Guizhou Province, saying that people in Guangdong are ashamed of it. Recently, Nanning has suddenly held military conferences and inspections of the province's troops. At the same time, the Guizhou Army has also moved to the He County, Fuchuan, Wuzhou, and Rongxu areas on the Guangdong-Guizhou border. It is reported that the Nanning military conference was to discuss the issue of sending troops to suppress the Communist bandits. The attendees, in addition to Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, included Chief of Staff Ye Qi, Seventh Army Commander Liao Lei, Deputy Commander Wang Zanxu, Fifteenth Army Commander Xia Wei, Deputy Commander Liang Chaoqi, and more than ten others. It was resolved that the entire Seventh Army and part of the Fifteenth Army would be dispatched to suppress the Communist bandits. The Seventh Army will take the road from Guilin via Pingle to He County, and part of the Fifteenth Army will go east from Liuzhou, all under the command of Seventh Army Commander Liao Lei. Li Bai and the two inspected the troops in Nanning on the 11th, and on the 20th, they set off again to inspect the troops in the entire province. The order and route were to first go to Liuzhou, then Qingyuan, Guilin, Quanzhou, Pingle, He County, the Zuoyoujiang area, Xunzhou, and finally to Wuzhou. The two division commanders Huang Zhengui and Wei Yunsong accompanied them along the way. The 19th Division of the current Seventh Army has arrived in the He County, Fuchuan, and Zhong County areas. The 44th Division of the Fifteenth Army, under Wang Zanbin, has arrived in Huaiji. The 231st Regiment, under Su Xinmin, has arrived in Wuzhou. Chen Jitang of Guangdong Province is simultaneously rushing to mobilize elite troops to Xiaobeijiang, Sihui, and other places in the upper reaches of the Xijiang River, reportedly in preparation for cooperating with the Guizhou Army to suppress the bandits.

<p>[P Fujian-Guangdong Bandit Suppression Under Discussion</p>
<p>Chen Jitang and Zhang Zhen Each Send Personnel to Shantou</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The incident of Guangdong troops entering Fujian to suppress bandits has not progressed since Chen Jitang telegraphed an order to slow down. Chen sent his Secretary-General Long Sihe to Shantou yesterday. It is said that he is still assisting the Third Army to enter Fujian. Long is from Fujian and served as a staff officer in Xu Chongzhi's army. He is familiar with the situation in Fujian Province. After Long arrived in Shantou, he immediately telegraphed Zhao'an to invite Zhang Zhen to Shantou to discuss the plan of advancing troops. Zhang sent Chief of Staff Xiao Yuesheng and Zhao'an County Magistrate He Shijun, who took two planes to come here. They arrived at 4 pm on the 20th. Lin Peiran, director of the 49th Division's Shantou office, accompanied Xiao and He to visit Long and Chen Zhongying, Chief of Staff of the Third Army. It is reported that the overall plan for Fujian and Guangdong to suppress bandits has been agreed upon. Therefore, He Shijun flew back to Zhao'an on the 21st to report his mission, while Xiao stayed in Shantou temporarily to await the final decision. Xiao Yuesheng often told the Shantou press that if the Communist bandits get Zhangzhou, it is like a tiger getting out of its cage. Its harm is not limited to a corner of southern Fujian, but may disrupt the entire country. The people of Fujian hope for the help of the Guangdong army, like drought expecting clouds and rain. Although Zhangpu and Yunxiao have been recovered by the 49th Division, the bandits are concentrated in Zhangzhou City and have the potential to flee to Quanzhou and Tong'an. Xiao said so, but the news obtained by the Shantou Air Force's reconnaissance flights over Fujian in recent days said that Zhangzhou City is sparsely populated, traffic is cut off, and the situation is extremely desolate. It is said that the bandits are still occupying Zhangzhou City, but no traces of the bandits have been found, so no speculation is dared. However, it is a fact that the main force of the bandits is concentrated in Nan'an. According to another report, the main force of Lin Biao's Red bandits retreated to Jinlong Mountain in Nan'an ten days ago and built defensive fortifications, expanding the trenches dug by Zhang Zhen. The place is only 30 miles away from Zhangzhou City, because Zhangzhou City has no natural defenses on all sides. Only some local Communists formed the Red Guard guerrillas and stationed in Zhangzhou City to raise funds. If the Fujian and Guangdong armies join forces to enter Zhangzhou, it may be settled without a fight. However, Nan'an may not escape a war because the area is a transportation hub between western and southern Fujian. As for the Guangdong army currently stationed on the Fujian-Jiangxi-Guangdong border, there are three divisions and one brigade. Zhang Ruigui and Zhang Da's two divisions are suppressing bandits in the Chao and Hui prefectures. However, the act of entering Fujian is still far away. It is said that Chen Jitang intends to have Zhang Zhen allow the Guangdong army to be stationed in Zhanglong for a long time before advancing troops. Long Sihe's visit to Shantou and the meeting with Zhang Zhen's representatives Xiao Yuesheng and He Shijun are related to this. Tu Sizong, representative of He Yingqin, came to Guangzhou on He's order to see Chen Jitang and negotiate bandit suppression. Tu is scheduled to arrive in Shantou on the 27th, also for bandit suppression negotiations. However, the bandit suppression operation has not yet seen active progress. (May 26)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Anhui Bandits Invade Zhengyang for the Second Time <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Various Parties Telegraph the Central Government for Assistance, but No Troops Have Arrived</p>
<p>The Bandits Intend to Harvest the Mature Wheat</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: After the Red bandits successively captured Zhengyang and Huoqiu, the situation in the Changhuai area suddenly became tense. The Red bandits have recently invaded further from Huoqiu, penetrating deep into Yingshang County and invading the Zhengyang Xinhekou area. The people of Fuyang, Yingshang, Shou, Feng and other counties are panicked. The Independent 40th Brigade, under Song Shike, has a small force. The Anhui Garrison 2nd Brigade, under Ni Rongxian, is also difficult to mobilize. Only these two units are blocking the upstream, and Red bandits are lurking in the Zhujiaxiang Xiatangji area southeast of Shou County, ready to move, which is particularly worrying. Therefore, Ni Rongxian recently telegraphed from Shou County to Bengbu and the various counties in northern Anhui, hoping to quickly appeal to the authorities to quickly send troops to suppress the bandits in the Zhengyang-Shou area. However, it has not yet been heard that the military authorities have agreed to send troops. Yu Yumen, Sun Qiqian and other representatives from northern Anhui have been running around in Beijing to petition in recent days, but have not seen any results. Telegrams from various directions to the central government requesting troops for rescue are like snowflakes, and they are very angry. Although Xu Tingyao's 4th Division has been in Bengbu for many days, it has not moved because it has no order to suppress the bandits. Since Zhengyangguan was recovered by the militia on the 15th of this month, the situation is still very dangerous because no troops have gone to station there. The refugees who fled do not dare to return. The time has come for the wheat to ripen, and the farmers dare not return to their villages to harvest, which is extremely anxious. If the wheat is harvested by the bandits, it will affect the people's food supply. Recently, according to refugees from Yingheji, Zhengyang, the Red bandits are indeed planning to collect wheat from the interior due to a shortage of food internally. According to transportation news, the Red bandits invaded Zhengyang for the second time on the afternoon of the 24th. The staff of the town's telegraph office immediately dismantled important parts and fled to Shou County for temporary shelter when the bandits were about to reach the city. Therefore, the telegrams from Bengbu to Zhengyang were not connected that night, and the truth is unknown. The Refugee Appeal Association in Bengbu and Shou County recently telegraphed the central government again to request troops to suppress the bandits, saying, "According to reliable reports, Zhengyang Jingwu has been invaded by Red bandits for the second time, and the momentum is huge. The counties in northern Anhui are like eggs in danger. Weeping bitterly, we implore you to quickly order the 4th Division to suppress the bandits day and night, in order to save the catastrophe. Northern Anhui belongs to the territory of China, and the people belong to the people of China. We have repeatedly appealed, but no troops have been sent to suppress the bandits, presumably because we have been deceived by the Song Brigade, which boasts of its achievements. Now that the bandit forces have grown, if we delay any longer, the wheat will belong to the bandits, and the people of Anhui may not survive. We are telegraphing in grief, waiting for orders, The Refugee Appeal Association in Bengbu kowtows." It is not known whether this telegram will attract the attention of the authorities. (May 25)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Strange Winds in Wuhan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Heavy Losses on the River Surface</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: From the 3rd to the 21st of this month, it rained continuously, and the river water rose. The people of Wuhan were frightened by the floods. The weather turned sunny on the 22nd and 23rd, and the temperature gradually increased, but the water continued to rise. After the 24th, it rained continuously again, and the river water rose to more than 30 feet. On the 27th, it rained heavily, followed by strange winds. On the shore, it was like thousands of horses galloping, and in the river, there were raging waves. It started at 12 noon and stopped late at night. The direction of the wind was uncertain, and it was not known where it came from. According to those who play in the waves, it was unprecedented in a century. The losses in the three towns of Wuhan on that day were the heaviest on the river surface. It is estimated that more than ten wooden rafts parked on Parrot Island were completely dismantled, large logs were lying across the river, and many small boats were sunk. At the same time, on the Hanyang river surface, the Dai Shengchang Deshan small steamer was sunk by the waves. The pontoon bridge outside the Hanyang East Gate disappeared. One pontoon bridge at the Wuchang Hanyangmen Ferry Terminal was also sunk by the waves. The Jian'e wheel of the Wuhan Ferry was wrecked and almost sunk. The extent of the loss can be imagined. When the wind was at its strongest, the Jianghan Customs immediately raised warning flags to notify all ships going upstream to pay special attention. The flag was lowered the next morning. In order to maintain transportation in Wuhan, the Construction Department specially dispatched the Jianwu and Jianhan wheels on the 28th to run the Wuchang to Jianghan Customs route. The ferry from Wangjiaxiang to Wuchang temporarily borrowed the provincial government's transport wheel</p>

<p>Pontoon bridge docked. The Yangtze River water level dropped by a few inches due to the strong wind on that day, and the climate changed from warm to cold. In one day, it seemed as if summer and autumn had changed seasons. (May 28)</p>

<p>The Henan Provincial Government has repeatedly ordered and warned against collecting tobacco tax in Luoyang, as it is the location of the provisional capital and is watched by both domestic and foreign parties. However, Guo Ping, the County Magistrate of Luoyang, has ordered the removal of tobacco seedlings near the railway, but not only does he not prohibit the tobacco seedlings in the other five districts, six districts, and eight districts, but he also sends personnel to privately collect tobacco tax. It seems that officials who publicly comply but privately defy orders and the opium poison will be endless. The people of Luoyang have filed a complaint with the Control Yuan, and it is said that they will order the Henan Provincial Government to strictly handle the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Shandong Library Receives New Song and Yuan Ancient Books <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Descendants of Liutang Donate More Than 100 Boxes</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The collection of ancient books in the Shandong Provincial Library has been quite rich since the director Wang Xiantang collected them in various ways since the previous year. It is now found that Liutang, whose courtesy name is Chunzhai, is from Fugou, Henan. During the Qing Dynasty, he traveled and served in Shandong and loved to collect books. He made every effort to collect old books from the Song and Yuan dynasties, creating a grand collection. After Liutang retired, he lived in seclusion in Dongliushui, a corner of Jinan City, near Ming Lake, which was rich in springs, rocks, bamboo, and trees. He decorated his collection of more than 100 large boxes. On his deathbed, he instructed his children and grandchildren to transport the books back to his original home in Henan and build a library to preserve them, so that they could not dispose of the books casually. However, since the death of Liutang, his children and grandchildren have not only failed to transport the books back to Henan, but Liutang's coffin has also been stranded in Jinan and has not been buried. Recently, they have been heavily in debt and unable to repay it. The creditors have repeatedly demanded payment and filed a complaint with the local court. The court then ruled that the books should be sold to repay the debt and first placed a provisional attachment on 24 boxes. A grandson of Liutang then recalled his ancestor's will that if the books could not be transported back to his original home, they should be donated to the nearby library. It was certainly impossible to sell them to repay the debt, which would violate the will of his ancestors. He went to visit Wang Xiantang, director of the Provincial Library, and stated his opinion, willing to donate the books to the library unconditionally. However, the creditors were very unreasonable and demanded that the library negotiate with the court on their behalf before the matter could be settled. Wang then went to the court to inquire. The court stated that as long as the will was true, the descendants naturally had no right to dispose of the case even though it had been decided. The debt could be repaid with other property. Therefore, the 68 large boxes of books that had not been seized were first transported to the library, and several boxes were also transported in succession. The creditors insisted on selling the 24 large boxes that had been provisionally attached to repay the debt. The court held another hearing yesterday, and the library also sent people to the court. Although no decision was made at the time, the will had been proven to be true, and it was clearly stated that the books would be donated to the library. As for the debts incurred by his children and grandchildren, the law could not change his ancestor's will and use the books to repay the debts. Therefore, it is feared that the books that have been seized will eventually be handed over to the library. The library is now planning to have the education department of the provincial government send personnel to jointly inspect the books with the descendants of the Liu family after they have been completely received and submit a report to the central government for commendation. The rare books are stored in boxes, and the words "Shouyu Collection" are engraved on the outside. They have not yet been opened for inspection, so the contents are not very clear. However, it is said that there is a collection of poems by An Lushan inside, which is a rare and fine edition in the world. The following is a brief list of the books: Old Rubbings of the Stone Classics of the Tang Imperial Academy, Imperially Ordered Complete Tang Prose, Imperially Ordered Complete Tang Poetry, Vermilion-Approved Imperial Edicts, Stone-Printed Jiutong, Yueyatang Series, Guangya Series, Imperially Ordered Seven Classics Imperial Case, Zhouyi Shu Yi, Imperially Ordered Rixia Shuwen Kao, Wenxian Zhengzi Lu, Daqing Tongli, Daqing Huidian Attached Rules, Zizhi Tongjian, Bi Xu Zizhi Tongjian, Ming Tongjian, Original Edition Yinghuan Zhilue, Daqing Yitong Yutu, Chouhai Tu Bian,</p>

<p>Returning the Aircraft Field to the People for Cultivation: More than 300 mu of farmland in Jiutu, south of the city, were leveled into a flat field. During the intense Shanghai war, personnel sent by the Ministry of Military Affairs surveyed and determined it to be an aircraft field. The rivers were filled, and the fields were abandoned. After more than a month of construction, a flat field was formed. Since the end of the war, farmers have been requesting its return for cultivation. Li Zuhua, director of the Property Management Office, has also telegraphed the Ministry of Military Affairs to quickly return the land in order to maintain agriculture. Recently, the office has received a reply from the Ministry of Military Affairs: "I have received your telegram. This case was submitted by Qian Ronggen, a farmer who requested the land be returned. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has been instructed to investigate the number of mu, prices, and compensation for losses in detail and report back for review." According to the telegram, we should still wait for the Jiangsu Provincial Government to review the matter. However, the farming season has arrived, and the return is still pending review, so the farmers there are all angry and worried.</p>
<p>Preparations for the Establishment of an Industrial Bank Branch: The Songjiang Bank's building was initially bid on by Fuyoutang, but later Shun gave up its right, and Yishi Ji was promoted to win the bid.

<p>The Red Cross Benefits the People of Songjiang: Songjiang has experienced several wars since Jiazi, and its vitality has not recovered. This Shanghai Incident, although fortunately not affected by the war, caused panic and escape, and people moved around. When they returned from the escape, they had no clothes or food. Zhou Xuewen, director of the Songjiang Red Cross Branch, consulted with the Shanghai General Association to allocate rice for disaster relief. It has been approved to allocate 200 bags of rice to save the poor. It will be transported to Songjiang soon. The following is a record of the General Association's reply: "In reply, I have received your letter and understand your concern. Your request to allocate hundreds of bags of rice to relieve the poor in Songjiang is approved to subsidize 200 bags of white rice, and Director Zhou of your branch has prepared the receipt and came to the association to collect it." This is addressed to the Songjiang Branch of the Chinese Red Cross, Wang Peiyuan, Director of the Chinese Red Cross.</p>

Recently, the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee came to the county to provide emergency relief and entrusted the First District to assist. The matter has been completed, and the villages heard the news and rushed to the city to claim it, but it was too late. On the 25th, nearly a thousand people gathered in the Chenghuang Temple and firmly requested relief from the District Office. The District Office could not cope with it. After several hours of disturbance, Huang Shizuo stood on the Gao Litie incense burner and loudly advised the crowd, and they dispersed. The next day, more than 100 disaster victims outside the Northeast Gate went to the War Disaster Relief Association to request relief. Vice Chairman Pan Changyu persuaded them to wait patiently for a solution. The disaster victims were anxiously waiting for relief and insisted on speeding up the process before dispersing.</p>

<p>The Silkworm Cocoon Relief Case Has Many Twists and Turns: The County Government received an instruction from the Department of Finance and ordered 160,000 yuan in collateral vouchers to be issued immediately. They were instructed to follow the methods promulgated by the department, organize a Jiangsu Province County Substitute Silkworm Cocoon Baking Committee, and supervise the Finance Bureau to invite the Chamber of Commerce, banks, money houses, cocoon and silk industries to pledge current funds and pay for the baking fees, so as to relieve the silkworm farmers and protect the natural products. County Magistrate Chen received the order and met with Director Wang of the Finance Bureau yesterday, inviting representatives from banks, money houses, cocoon and silk industries, and the Chamber of Commerce to discuss the matter thoroughly. As a result, it was decided that (1) the Shanghai war had just stopped, all industries were depressed, and finance had not recovered. Banks, money houses, cocoons, and silk all felt difficulties. Now it is the end of May, and it is extremely difficult to pledge current funds. (2) This loan is limited to three months for repayment. According to the current situation, there are still many old cocoons in Wuxi. Within three months, farmers will have no opportunity to sell cocoons. If they are to be ordered to repay this substitute baking loan, it will not be possible in fact. (3) The Cocoon Industry Association has already issued a notice from the Department of Industry to all businesses at the general meeting, deciding that each cocoon business will do its best to bake on behalf of others, and the baking fee will be offset by cocoons. (4) Now that the silkworm cocoons have been put on the market, if we follow the order of the department, the procedures will be complicated and it will be too late, and we are afraid that it will cause delays. (5) Please the county government to submit a reply to the two departments of finance and industry based on the above points, and return the collateral vouchers.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce Appeals to Relieve the People's Difficulties: The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce submitted a request to the provincial government yesterday based on the resolutions of the members' general meeting to exempt this year's silk cocoon business tax and to exempt two months' rent to relieve the people's difficulties. Telegraphic Request to Stop the Special Business Tax: The Jiangsu Provincial Government, due to the failure to improve the handling of the business tax in Jiangsu Province, plans to implement a special business tax on eight categories: bamboo, wood, paper, cotton, cocoons, northern and southern goods, coal, and soybean oil. The tax rate is set at 20 per thousand, and collection bureaus will be set up at important ports. The original business tax will be changed to a business license tax, which will be implemented on July 1. The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce yesterday, requesting that it be submitted to the Central Provincial Department to request a stop to the implementation. The general idea is that the Jiangsu Provincial Government is implementing a special business tax and setting up collection bureaus at important ports, which is undoubtedly a disguised form of likin. Although the provincial authorities stated that only one tax will be levied and no re-tax will be levied, which is different from likin, the drawbacks of likin in the past were all in the collection of fees for permits. Since bureaus are set up along the way, permits cannot be avoided, and there will be many drawbacks. The past can be taken as a lesson. Moreover, the tax rate is set at 20 per thousand, which is 2 percent, which is more than the fourth article of the general outline of the collection of business tax in each province passed by the Central Political Conference, which stipulates that the business tax rate should not exceed 2 per thousand. It has exceeded it by ten times. This is the point that it is different from the ordinary business tax, not the order of priority, but the tax rate is too high and far exceeds the scope of business tax collection. It has been found that the chambers of commerce in Jiangsu Province have previously sent letters to the Finance Department, stating that the special business tax is a heavy tax on goods, which is more harsh than likin. The most important thing is that they have stated that the implementation has been suspended. At this time, the Shanghai war has just stopped, and the market has no hope of recovery. How can we intensify the situation and increase the suffering of merchants? Recently, it has been seen in the newspapers that the special business tax in Anhui Province has been revoked by order of the central government. I hereby request that you send a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, the various departments of the National Government, the Provincial Political Party Department, and the two departments of the Provincial Government, Finance and Industry, to stop the implementation and immediately withdraw the dispatched preparation personnel in order to maintain commerce and secure the region.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Twists and Turns in Yesterday's Inspection of the Wusong Machine Factory <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Takeover Committee to Negotiate with the Japanese</p>
<p>Inspection and Takeover tentatively scheduled for this morning</p>
<p>The first phase of the Japanese army's withdrawal has been completed in stages. However, the Wusong Machine Factory of the two Railway Bureaus has not yet been returned to us, preventing the resumption of traffic on the railways. According to the armistice conference's subcommittee agreement, the Japanese side must not obstruct transportation in areas temporarily occupied by the Japanese army. The two Railway Bureaus have sent a letter to the Takeover Committee, requesting the Japanese side to return the Wusong Machine Factory as soon as possible. They also sent representatives to negotiate with Teno Masaichi, the company commander of the Third Battalion of the Ninth Regiment of the Ninth Division of the Japanese army stationed there, and Harada Yūkichi, a member of the Japanese Joint Committee, agreed to allow our side to send representatives for inspection yesterday. However, during the inspection yesterday, the Japanese side suddenly changed its mind, insisting on our taking over and refusing inspection before the takeover. This action by the Japanese side is truly incomprehensible. After several negotiations, it was decided last night that our side would be allowed to inspect first and then take over at 10:00 this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection Once Refused</p>
<p>The Wusong Machine Factory is the main facility for repairing machinery for the two Railway Bureaus, and its scope is very broad. All repairs for locomotives and machinery for the two railways are done there. When the Japanese army began to withdraw, the two Railway Bureaus, in order to restore traffic as soon as possible, repeatedly requested the Takeover Committee to negotiate with Japanese Joint Committee members such as Harada to quickly return the factory. However, although the Japanese side agreed to return it immediately, they never confirmed a date. The two Railway Bureaus were forced to appoint special commissioners Zhang Xuetao, Xu Yingsheng, and Zhuang Qin to go to Wusong on the 27th of this month to negotiate with Teno Masaichi, the company commander of the Third Battalion of the Ninth Regiment of the Ninth Division of the Japanese army stationed at the factory. They also planned to conduct an initial inspection to thoroughly investigate the internal damage in order to plan for proper reorganization. However, the company commander refused our personnel sternly, stating that the Japanese army would withdraw from the area soon, and Chinese personnel could come for inspection before the takeover, which would be simpler. Our personnel negotiated repeatedly but to no avail and had to return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Permits Inspection</p>
<p>After being refused, the two Railway Bureaus' personnel reported the details to Bureau Chief Chen Xinghan, who then requested the Takeover Committee to negotiate with the Japanese side again, allowing our side to send personnel for inspection before the takeover to facilitate all preparations. After receiving the report, the Takeover Committee negotiated with Japanese Joint Committee member Harada Yūkichi, who immediately expressed his agreement. He wrote a letter of introduction, for our side's personnel to negotiate with Japanese Company Commander Teno, specifying that inspection was permitted and stamped with Harada's seal. After receiving the letter, the Takeover Committee immediately notified the two Railway Bureaus, scheduling an inspection of the factory for 10:00 yesterday afternoon. Therefore, the two Railway Bureaus' personnel, together with Takeover Committee Secretary Li Mu and others, went to the factory yesterday to inspect everything.</p>
<p>Personnel Inspecting Yesterday</p>
<p>At 9:00 yesterday morning, the personnel of the two Railway Bureaus and representatives of the Chinese-British Banking Corporation gathered at the Joint Office on Xiai'en'si Road. At 9:20, they departed with the Takeover Committee personnel for inspection. Those from the Takeover Committee included Secretary Li Mu, Wu Hong, Special Commissioner Cha Nanqiang, and the Chinese-British Banking Corporation representative, Englishman David Smith. Those from the two Railway Bureaus included Chief of Mechanical Affairs Wang Shenshan, Chief Engineer Deshifu, Factory Director of the Machine Factory Mao Erwei, Assistant to the Works Department of the Ministry of Railways Sun Mou, Chief Supervisor of Mechanical Affairs Mensfield, Mechanical Affairs Office Staff Xue Zhixian, Yan Xiangsheng, Wu Jinfu, Special Commissioners Xu Yingsheng, Zhang Xuetao, Zhuang Qin, Chemical Examination Engineer Lu Baogan, Electrical Engineer Ge Lai, and others.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Refuses Again</p>
<p>The inspection party arrived at the Wusong Machine Factory at 10:20. Takeover Committee Special Commissioner Cha Nanqiang and Railway Bureau Special Commissioner Xu Yingsheng were about to enter and negotiate with Teno Masaichi, the company commander of the Japanese troops stationed at the factory. However, the Japanese troops stationed at the factory firmly refused entry. They then presented the letter from Japanese Commissioner Harada of the Joint Committee, ordering the Japanese soldiers to notify the company commander. However, after waiting for three quarters of an hour, a Japanese adjutant was sent out from the factory to negotiate, telling our personnel that the consulate had not notified them about the inspection in advance, so they refused entry. They also said that the Japanese troops at the factory had received an order from the Japanese army department last night (i.e., the night before) to hand over the factory's machine rooms to the Chinese side for takeover today (i.e., yesterday). The Japanese troops stationed at the factory would withdraw in a day or two. Our personnel told them that they were there today to inspect on orders, and that the Japanese army's withdrawal had not been notified in advance, and that our side was not prepared, so they insisted on an initial inspection. The Japanese adjutant did not dare to make a decision and reported our intentions to the Japanese company commander, who came out after ten minutes, still firmly refusing our visit, saying that the unit, since receiving orders to transfer, had completed all procedures, and asked the two Railway Bureaus' special commissioners Xu Yingsheng, Zhang Xuetao and Zhuang Qin, who had negotiated before, to enter and carry out the transfer procedures with the Japanese company commander. As for the inspection, it could be carried out after the procedures were completed. At that time, our personnel argued according to reason, but still to no avail. At 11:30, the negotiations still had no results. Our personnel and representatives of the Central Silver Company, etc., all suspected each other and returned home. However, the Japanese company commander Teno suddenly came out in person to discuss with our side, firmly demanding that our side take over that day. At that time, our side firmly refused because the procedures had not yet been completed, and asked the company commander when the Japanese troops stationed at the factory would withdraw. The Japanese company commander initially replied within a day or two, then replied on the 31st, and the meaning of the words shifted. Our personnel felt more puzzled and told him that it was difficult for our side to take over before the Japanese army withdrew. The Japanese company commander did not think about it and said that after the Chinese side took over today (i.e. yesterday), it could send a police force to the factory to monitor tomorrow (i.e. today). Our side still did not agree because this matter was of great importance. At that time, Yin Rugeng, chairman of the Takeover Committee, was inspecting in Wusong and saw the car passing the Wusong Machine Factory, and stopped the car to inquire about everything. He was reported in detail and Yin chairman also felt that it was inconvenient to take over suddenly in terms of procedures, and verbally ordered to postpone the inspection and let the Takeover Committee negotiate with the Japanese side before making a decision. So the entire inspection team returned to Shanghai one after another.</p>
<p>Intentions of Japanese Refusal</p>
<p>There is no reason for the Japanese military authorities to refuse our personnel to inspect. We had already negotiated this matter with Japanese Commissioner Harada and Harada had drafted a letter allowing inspection. So what was the company commander's intention in obstructing this, it is not possible to measure. The property of the two railways had been heavily damaged by the Japanese army and the Chinese-British Banking Corporation had negotiated with the Japanese side for compensation due to creditor relations.</p>
<p>The Japanese side had long agreed. The Wusong Machine Factory suffered the greatest losses among the two Railway Bureaus properties. Therefore, the two Railway Bureaus needed to inspect beforehand to determine the extent of the damage in order to report. However, the Japanese side insisted on taking over before our side could inspect, so the intention was, of course, to evade responsibility.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Notifies of Withdrawal</p>
<p>The withdrawal date of the Japanese troops stationed at the factory has been formally notified by the Japanese Joint Committee member Harada to the Joint Committee and our committee members, and is scheduled to be completed on the 31st. Therefore, our side specifically went for inspection yesterday. However, the Japanese military authorities disregarded the intentions of the Japanese Commissioner of the Joint Committee and refused without reason, which is really strange.</p>
<p>Negotiate for Re-Inspection</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00, Wang Shenshan, Director of the Mechanical Affairs Office, returned to the Takeover Committee to discuss the machine factory inspection issue and it was decided to negotiate with the Japanese side again and to insist on inspecting before taking over, and so on.</p>
<p>Inspection and Takeover Today</p>
<p>According to news from the Takeover Committee, the Joint Committee and the Japanese Commissioner Harada agreed last night at 8:00 to inspect first this morning at 10:00 and take over at 11:00 the same day. After receiving the report, all personnel taking over the factory and the two Railway Bureaus' special commissioners scheduled to meet at the Joint Office at 9:00 this morning and go to the Wusong Machine Factory for inspection and then take over.</p>

<p>Yin Rugeng Inspected Yesterday</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng, chairman of the Takeover Committee for the Japanese Army's Withdrawal Zone, took the special commissioners Yin Tixin, Liang Fuchu, Li Shengjun, and Tao Xiaojie to inspect everything in the areas where we restored police power yesterday at 9:40 a.m., as all administrative affairs in the Japanese Army's Temporary Occupation Zone were restored the other day. The inspection is as follows: (1) Fudan University - led by the university staff, they inspected for a week. It was said that the Japanese army withdrew yesterday, and the university took over immediately without signing a handover document. Our police are now stationed to protect it. (2) Wusong Town - inspected with the seventh district chief Li Jing. It was said that the territory under the jurisdiction of the first and second branches (i.e. Yinxing Shenjiahang) was very quiet, and our police had stationed posts this morning and sent teams to patrol everywhere. A notice has been issued in the Pao Taiwan area to prohibit taking photos of the fortress. (3) Shenjiahang, Yinxianggang, Hongzhen, etc. - inspected from Wusong to Shenjiahang and saw that our police were temporarily stationed in the local primary school, totaling twenty-three people, fully distributed. Then they inspected the fifth district fourth station of the Public Security Bureau and the fifth district third station of Hongzhen via Mayushan Road to Yinxianggang Town. Chairman Yin instructed the respective police chiefs to pay special attention to public security for today's May 30th anniversary. He returned to the committee at 1:40 p.m.</p>

<p>No Formalities</p>
<p>The Hongzhen area in the Japanese army's temporary occupation zone belongs to the jurisdiction of the third branch of the fifth district. The other day (28th), the Takeover Committee sent Yin Tixin and Liang Fuchu, together with Wu Tingxun, director of the third branch of the fifth district of the Public Security Bureau, Liu Shuchun, captain of the third company of the second battalion of the Beiping-transferred Shanghai Police Security Team, Xue Huikang of the Education Bureau, and others, leading more than 100 police officers to take over everything. They arrived at Linping Road at 3:00 and went to the Japanese Army Military Police Headquarters at the Municipal Yucai Primary School to meet with Sergeant Tsuji Yasoji and Special Agent Camp Commander Urata Takumi. At that time, no handover procedures were held. They only talked briefly, drank champagne, and then began to withdraw. Our side immediately stationed posts, totaling sixteen posts, completed at 4:40. The Japanese Military Police withdrew completely at 5:30. The report of the takeover is recorded as follows: For the matter of reporting, the subordinate officer led the third company from Jiangwan Town at 3:00 p.m. on the 28th of the month to set up sixteen posts in the Hongzhen area under the jurisdiction of the third branch of the fifth district, a total of twenty-four police officers per post, with four additional patrol police. After the posts were set up, they went to the Japanese Military Police at the Yucai School at 4:40 p.m. together with Wu Tingxun, the Wang director of the fifth district. At the same time, Yin Tixin, a representative sent by the Public Security Bureau Takeover Committee, contacted the special agent chief of the Japanese side. According to the special agent chief of the Japanese military police, there were no handover procedures. He also said that the place must be protected to ensure peace, and so on. The military police withdrew completely at 5:30 p.m. This is the report, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Japanese Army Continues to Withdraw <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Summary of Local Conditions</p>
<p>Sudden Withdrawal of Japanese Troops in Two Places</p>
<p>The Far East Racecourse in Yinxianggang originally had many Japanese troops stationed there, but the Japanese military authorities suddenly withdrew the other afternoon without notifying the Joint Committee and our committee members. Fortunately, our side learned of this and ordered the person in charge of the racecourse to take over. The Japanese troops at Fudan University in Jiangwan District also suddenly withdrew the same day. This kind of action obviously does not conform to the principles of the agreement. Fortunately, the Fudan University authorities sent personnel to take over afterwards, but the extent of the damage in both places is still under investigation. The responsibility for this must be borne by the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Japanese Prostitutes Return Home One After Another</p>
<p>When the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, many Japanese prostitutes also arrived in Shanghai one after another. When the Shanghai war was fierce, there were as many as several thousand Japanese prostitutes in this port. For a time, the supply exceeded demand. Later, the Japanese Consulate authorities tried to send some back. However, there are still many Japanese prostitutes stationed in Shanghai. Because most of the Japanese army has returned home, there is no one to patronize the Japanese brothels and life is desolate. Therefore, they are also automatically returning home. Many Japanese brothels on Junkong Road have been removed yesterday. Several trucks are hired by the Japanese brothels to load bedding and sundries, which are very urgent. They are all eager to return home.</p>
<p>What are the Japanese Keeping Bullets For?</p>
<p>During the Japanese army's invasion of Shanghai, many military supplies were shipped to Shanghai, enough for a long-term war. Now that the Japanese army has been ordered to withdraw, they are returning home one after another. The troops stationed in Shanghai will be completely withdrawn soon. However, according to reliable sources, although the Japanese army is withdrawing this time, all the large quantities of ammunition are still kept in Shanghai for use against our country at any time.</p>
<p>Provocative Incident in Miaohang</p>
<p>The Japanese troops stationed in Miaohang suddenly withdrew before the 18th of this month. Our side was not notified beforehand. Our side had no choice but to send personnel to take over afterwards. However, on the 20th and 21st, many Japanese troops suddenly armed themselves and went to the town to fire shots to provoke. Our Joint Committee members Yu and Wen severely negotiated with the Japanese side. It is now heard that the Japanese side has replied to this matter, denying that any Japanese troops went there to make a show of force. (Above, China East News Agency)</p>
<p>Industrial Cooperative Closes</p>
<p>The Industrial Cooperative established by Japanese merchants inside the Sanyuan Temple on Peng Road has had very few customers and merchants since its opening, and the business is extremely deserted, which is far from what was expected. According to the scale of the cooperative, it is similar to our country's commodity exhibition hall. It was originally established to promote the sales of Japanese goods and unite Japanese merchants. Now that the Japanese army is withdrawing one after another, the Sanyuan Temple cannot be occupied for a long time. The Japanese merchants' joint meeting has decided to close the cooperative from today. They are now sorting out the inventory and preparing to cancel it. (Dagong News Agency)</p>

<p>Four Transport Ships Tomorrow</p>
<p>Led by Ueta Kenkichi Back to Japan</p>
<p>The Ninth Division of the Japanese Army stationed in Shanghai was an important unit in this Shanghai war. It was dispatched from Japan on February 14th and began a general attack on February 20th. It was the main force in the battles of Caojia Bridge, Zhanghuabang, Miaohang, and other battles. Many officers and soldiers were killed and wounded. When the 11th and 14th Divisions came to Shanghai, the division was reassigned to the rear and was replenished one after another. The division has been in Shanghai for more than one hundred days and is now gradually withdrawing. The subsequent troops that will depart are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Artillery</p>
<p>Yesterday, one company of artillery of the Ninth Division, twelve cannons, one company of motor vehicle units, 160 military vehicles, the horse farm bottom used by the cavalry, the bottom of the armory, and all the staff of the military hospital were loaded onto a transport ship from the Osaka Wharf in Yangshupu and left the mouth of Wusong at 1:00 p.m. to return to Japan. One company of the Ninth Engineering Battalion and one flight company, carrying four disassembled aircraft, were loaded onto the Maya Maru and other ships and left Shanghai at 2:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Transportation Team</p>
<p>When the war was tense, the Third Water Transportation Team, a team from the Sixth Division of the Japanese Army, consisting of more than 300 officers and soldiers, with many transport equipment, was ordered to withdraw. It is scheduled to be loaded onto the Ikoma Maru at the Huishan Wharf at 11:30 a.m. today and transported to Osaka, Japan.</p>
<p>Remaining Troops</p>
<p>The remaining troops of the infantry, cavalry, baggage, and artillery of the Ninth Division, as well as the military supplies department and the management department of the dispatched headquarters, and the bottom of the Ninth Division headquarters, etc., have been processed in recent days and are scheduled to be transported by three transport ships and one warship on the 31st. Ueta Kenkichi, commander of the Ninth Division, will also lead his subordinates back home on that day. The Japanese army in Shanghai will then be completely withdrawn, leaving 2,500 naval landing troops stationed in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Six Counties Including Li, Tai, Jia, Bao, Qing, Kun, and Chang</p>
<p>A Request for an Additional 300,000 Yuan for Relief</p>
<p>Relief Should Be Based on Loans With Exceptions</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial War Zone Relief Committee previously resolved to dispatch Mu Ouchu, Jiang Hengyuan, Zou Bingwen, Yao Huiquan, and others to inspect the disaster situation in the war zones. Now, Mu and others have completed their inspections in stages and have drafted a first-step relief plan to report to the committee for discussion. The report and plan are recorded below:</p>
<p>First Report: The time spent inspecting the war zones this time was only two days, so it was only a hasty overview of the general situation. Now, based on the initial findings of the inspection, the report is as follows: (1) Gujiazhai: More than a dozen houses were bombed, and two residents were killed. (2) Luodian: Did not enter the town itself, only briefly stayed at the bus station. The office of the station was empty, and many residents were robbed. (The above pertains to Baoshan County.) (3) Liuhe: 33 civilian houses, temples, and schools were bombed and destroyed, and 8 people died. The Japanese army occupied this place for a long time, and the number of soldiers was large. All households occupied by Japanese soldiers were severely damaged. (4) Qianjing: 27 houses were burned down, and more than ten people died. (5) Fuqiao: More than 100 civilian houses were burned down on both sides of the bridge (north and south), more than 70 residents died, and more than 30 head of cattle were lost. This place was the route taken by the Japanese army after landing at Liuhe, so the losses were relatively heavy. (6) Qiyakou: Because a portion of the Japanese army landed here, the devastation was particularly severe. In the village named "First Village," out of 175 households, 168 were burned down, about 70 people died, and more than 30 head of cattle were lost. (The above pertains to Taicang County.) (7) Jiading: More than 40 houses were burned down outside the East Gate, 48 houses were burned down outside the North Gate, and the city within the walls was almost deserted. Seven or eight places were bombed and destroyed. (8) Loutang: Located north of Jiading city, 10 li away from the city, it belongs to the fifth district of the county. Out of a total of 7,000 households in the entire district, 274 were burned down, and 125 people died. In Loutang town itself, out of 700 households, 100 were bombed and burned down. The eastern part of the town was the most severely damaged. (9) Zhujiaqiao: 41 households were burned down, and 7 people died. It is heard that there is a village called Zhongzhai, 10 li north of Zhujiaqiao, where all of the ten-plus households were burned down. (10) Nanxiang: The bridge in the city was bombed and destroyed, and several civilian houses nearby collapsed due to the tremors. More than 20 other civilian houses were also bombed and burned down. (The above pertains to Jiading County.) In addition, the following should be reported incidentally: (1) Along Zhongshan Road through Dachang, most of the utility poles were cut down by the Japanese army, and about 20 damaged cars and trucks were abandoned on the roadside. (2) In Jiading city and Liuhe, the Japanese posted slogans, mostly containing provocative and pro-Shanghai free city sentiments. (3) On the doors of houses in Nanxiang, there are occasional strips of paper with the three characters "Jiansuo Ji" (檢索濟) written on them. These were written by the Japanese, and next to them is a line of small characters saying "Temporary Post-Disaster Maintenance Association" and stamped with a seal. Inspectors: Ouchu, Jiang Hengyuan, Zou Bingwen, Yao Huiquan.</p>
<p>Second Report: After the 23rd of this month, departed from Shanghai to Kunshan and Changshu counties to inspect the military deployment, the situation of the farmers, and the general state of losses. A summary report is as follows: (1) Kunshan: Along the Qingyang Port to both banks of the Wusong River in Kunshan are important defense areas for our 19th Route Army. Moreover, because the county seat is very close to Taicang (the two county seats are only 27 li apart), the defenses are particularly tight along the river in the northern and eastern parts of the city. Wherever the defending army reaches along the river, deep trenches are built on one bank, covered with wooden planks, and iron netting is densely placed on the other bank. Water is also diverted into the farmland to block the enemy's advance. Outside the iron netting, the houses of farmers along the river, deemed to obstruct military operations, were mostly destroyed and burned. As for the use of farmers' doors, tables, and benches for building trenches, the cutting down of trees and bamboo poles, and the use of farmers' boats for transportation, these were all common occurrences. During the inspection, the situation seen along the way was as follows: Outside the North Gate and North Gate Street of the county seat, seven houses were demolished. In the northeast of the county seat, two houses were burned down, totaling 14 rooms. In Yujiacun, north of the Qingyang Port Bridge, 15 houses were burned down, totaling 27 rooms. In Wubao Village, 11 houses were burned down, totaling more than 70 rooms. In Xiaohe Village, outside the Daxi Gate, five civilian houses were demolished. In Jiangjing, seven houses were demolished, totaling 25 rooms. Piles of rubble were everywhere, and the scene was extremely miserable. Farmers had no houses to live in. One family of seven or eight people was huddled in a small cowshed. Food was extremely scarce, and there was no way to buy rice seeds. Moreover, because the defense works had not been removed, there were no roads for taking water in or out, so even if they wanted to plant seedlings, there was no way to start. According to the county's investigation report, a total of more than 800 houses in the county were damaged or demolished, and a total of 156,000 mu of fields were flooded. Very few villagers had wheat fields, and the spring harvest was almost completely hopeless. It is also heard that in the northern part of the county, the fields and embankments have been damaged and not yet repaired. A slight rain will cause flooding, and the situation is particularly precarious. (2) Changshu: The troops stationed in the county dug trenches crisscrossing for a length of 82 li. Moreover, because the dug trenches were frequently changed, the area of farmland damaged was quite extensive, estimated to be more than 53,000 mu in total. As for farmers' boats, doors, utensils, and food, they have already been taken and used up. Farmers currently have no food for the next day, let alone rice seedlings to plant. Although they were able to return to their hometowns, most of them were unable to maintain their livelihoods. Some even resorted to using wild grass mixed with bran or cottonseed to fill their stomachs. The county government and local public organizations, because they had exhausted their resources to supply the military, had no more resources to seek relief. Recently, they barely managed to persuade the Farmers Bank to lend 16,000 yuan, which was divided among the 15 districts of the county. The amount received by each district was extremely small, a drop in the bucket, and did nothing to help. During the inspection, the situation in various places such as Dongtang City, the North City District, Wuqu, and Sujiaweng was generally the same. Inspectors: Mu Ouchu, Jiang Hengyuan, Zou Bingwen, Yao Huiquan. Implementation of Relief Measures: The colleagues were entrusted by the general assembly to go to various war zones to inspect the disaster situation, and the task has now been completed. Reports have been submitted repeatedly. Now, considering the overall situation of the various regions, a first-step relief plan is hereby formulated for implementation. Before listing the specific measures, a brief explanation of the nature and scope of the war zones, the types of disasters, and the principles of the relief measures is given, totaling ten articles: (1) The war zones are divided into the following three types according to their nature and scope: Category 1: Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan. Most of these three counties were occupied by enemy troops and are directly affected areas. Category 2: Qingpu. Enemy troops only occupied a small part, and the affected area is not large. Category 3: Kunshan and Changshu. These two counties suffered significant losses due to the deployment of our troops here, and they are indirectly affected areas. (2) The six counties listed in the previous article have been personally inspected one after another. At the same time, based on oral and written reports from people in the respective counties, the disaster situation is considered to have the following eleven aspects: (A) Major population casualties (Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan). (B) Houses burned down or demolished (Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan, Kunshan, Qingpu). (C) Farmers' cattle, boats, and implements lost (Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan, Kunshan, Changshu). (D) Farmland flooded, resulting in spring harvest losses (Kunshan). (E) Farmland lost due to trench digging (Taicang, Kunshan, Changshu). (F) Damage to farmland embankments (Kunshan, Changshu). (G) Destruction of rural bridges (Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan, Kunshan, Changshu). (H) Farmers lacking food (all six counties). (I) Farmers unable to buy rice seeds (all six counties). (J) Small workers and small businesses unable to operate (Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan). (K) Primary school teachers unemployed and impoverished (Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan). (3) The disaster situations listed in the previous article are divided into two steps for relief: the first step is emergency relief, and the second step is recovery. In addition to the ten million yuan allocated by the provincial government for relief to the three counties of Tai, Jia, and Bao, which are directly affected areas, it is now proposed to consolidate the six counties and allocate another 300,000 yuan as the first step of relief. The second step of recovery relief will be handled after the government allocates a large sum of money. The proportion of the second step of recovery funds allocated to the three counties of Tai, Jia, and Bao should be especially higher than that of other counties. (4) The first step of relief funds should be based on loans as a principle, with grants as an exception. (5) Based on the above articles, after careful consideration, it is determined that the following types of relief should be given urgently: (A) Loans to build temporary thatched huts for shelter. (B) Food aid to prevent starvation, either through subsidized sales or grants, depending on the actual situation. (C) Loans to purchase rice seeds, which can be implemented by organizing mutual aid societies. (D) Loans to repair embankments, which can be borrowed by the county government or local organizations. (6) Based on the above articles, the estimated amounts of the first step of relief funds for each county and their uses are as follows: (A) Taicang: 35,000 yuan for building temporary houses, 10,000 yuan for purchasing rice seeds, 15,000 yuan for loans to small workers and small businesses, totaling 60,000 yuan. (B) Jiading: 30,000 yuan for building temporary houses, 10,000 yuan for purchasing rice seeds, 10,000 yuan for assisting small workers and small businesses, 10,000 yuan for assisting primary school teachers' teaching expenses, totaling 60,000 yuan. (C) Baoshan: 40,000 yuan for building temporary houses. (D) Kunshan: 40,000 yuan for purchasing rice seeds, 10,000 yuan for building embankments, 10,000 yuan for building temporary houses and providing food aid, totaling 60,000 yuan. (E) Changshu: 20,000 yuan for purchasing rice seeds, 20,000 yuan for building embankments, 14,000 yuan for providing food aid, totaling 54,000 yuan. (F) Qingpu: The affected area is relatively small, and it is proposed to allocate 6,000 yuan. (7) Except for a very small portion of the funds listed in the previous article that will be granted, all loans to farmers, small workers, small businesses, and primary school teachers should be implemented with reference to the mutual aid society methods implemented by the China International Famine Relief Commission in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, repayable in installments over five years. The funds for building embankments will be borrowed by the county governments and can be repaid from local land tax surcharges, repayable in installments over three years. The repaid funds will be used as a local rural cooperative business fund for each county in the future. (8) The counties in the war zone should take this opportunity to quickly form rural relief associations to be responsible for organizing mutual aid societies, lending funds to farmers, and all other matters. Regarding these detailed measures, the committee should separately appoint experts to conduct thorough research and formulate practical and easy-to-implement plans for adoption by the counties. (9) These 300,000 yuan of emergency relief funds are extremely urgent. It would be best if the government could allocate them within five days; otherwise, the committee should find ways to borrow them, and then repay them when the government's relief funds arrive. (10) Of these 300,000 yuan of relief funds, it should be stipulated that 85 percent or more be used for loans. The committee should notify the six county branches to each send a representative to the meeting to jointly discuss liaison, mutual assistance, and unified measures. It is also hoped that each county will immediately form a rural relief association within its branch to prepare for loan matters. Inspectors: Zou Bingwen, Mu Ouchu, Jiang Hengyuan, Yao Huiquan.</p>

<p>Due to the importance of defense in the Longhua area, the Garrison Command requested the deployment of troops. Yesterday afternoon, two companies of military police arrived from Suzhou and were stationed in the vicinity to take on guard duties, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Japanese Aircraft Appeared Again Yesterday, Not Long After the Armistice Agreement Was Signed <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>At 3:50 PM yesterday, two Japanese aircraft flew over the Songhu area and reconnoitered the Longhua area at around 4:00 PM. They landed at 4:10 PM. This matter has attracted the attention of various circles in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, because it has been less than a month since the signing of the armistice agreement, and the Japanese side has already taken this kind of action, which is a violation of the spirit of the first article of the agreement. It is expected that the Joint Commission will pay even more attention to this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Today is the May 30th Anniversary <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Iron Gates at the Border Between the Chinese Area and the Foreign Concessions are Closed, Leaving Only Essential Roads Open</p>
<p>Police Armed and Deployed to Prohibit Parades and Gatherings</p>
<p>Today is the seventh anniversary of the May 30th Incident. Various circles in the city are holding commemorative meetings and conducting public memorial ceremonies at the May 30th Martyrs' Cemetery at Fangjia Wooden Bridge in northern Zhabei. The Shanghai People's Anti-Armistice Agreement and Support Northeast Volunteers Joint Association has scheduled a memorial meeting at 10:00 AM today at the Ximen Public Sports Field to commemorate Gu Zhenghong and the anti-Japanese martyrs who died, and to discuss counter-Japanese policies. It is heard that the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Yingxing, decided to implement a ban to prevent reactionary elements from infiltrating, as it was resolved in mid-May to prohibit parades and gatherings.</p>
<p>Temporary Martial Law: The Municipal Public Security Bureau has instructed all districts, branches, and police stations to implement martial law today. Double posts are stationed at all key roads, and companies of the police brigade are armed and deployed. Vehicle patrol teams have been dispatched to patrol and inspect pedestrians, prohibiting any gatherings. The Public Security Bureaus of the Public Concession and the French Concession have issued orders to all police stations to strictly guard against the opportunistic riots of reactionary elements. The iron gates at the border between the Chinese area and the Foreign Concessions are temporarily closed, leaving only one or two essential roads open for vehicular traffic.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Report on the Opening of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Restoring to the Original State Before the War Starting June 1st</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of restoring traffic on both railways, it has been decided to restore to the original state before the war starting June 1st. The two railway directors, Chen Xinghan, also reported to the Ministry of Railways on the 28th, with a telegram stating: "Minister Gu and Vice Minister Zeng of the Nanjing Ministry of Railways, for your attention, confidential. Your telegram has been received and noted. I have been reporting to your ministry on a daily basis regarding the various situations of road repair and traffic resumption on our railway. Since the Shanghai Incident, all bridges, road tracks, stations, car yards, engine rooms, power lines, telephones, and various traffic facilities east of Kunshan have been almost completely destroyed. There was no hope of restoring traffic in a short period. However, considering the importance of Nanjing-Shanghai transportation, if there is any possibility, we should be responsible for doing our best. At the beginning of the armistice agreement process, we separately asked the diplomatic authorities and the representatives of our railway creditors to pay attention to preserving our railway industry and transportation, and to supervise the heads of the locomotive, engineering, and material departments to prepare for road repair and traffic resumption work. When the agreement was signed, and the Japanese troops had not withdrawn, we further negotiated with the Chinese and Japanese military authorities to not hinder the progress of our road repair work. Fortunately, the planning was thorough, and the employees were courageous. The Qingyang Port Bridge was quickly repaired, and the Nanjing-Xiang railway traffic was able to resume ahead of schedule. However, because the Japanese side firmly held Zhenhu and refused to return it, the road repair work was slightly frustrated in its eastward progress. We then negotiated several times with the Japanese naval and army authorities before obtaining permission to send 60 road workers to repair the road first. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 23rd, when the Japanese troops withdrew from Zhenhu, the test train followed and arrived at the North Station at 5:30 PM that afternoon. The next morning, Nanjing-Shanghai traffic was able to resume. At that time, although the trunk line had been repaired, most of the station tracks, car yard switches, platforms, power lines, telephones, signals, and other equipment at each station had not been repaired.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Third Sheet <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>As a result, train meetings, dispatching, grouping, and driving speed were all difficult. Moreover, the original engine room at the North Station, which was used for minor repairs and maintenance of locomotives after arrival, was also completely destroyed and looted in this incident, leading to the use of rescue vehicles and tools to repair locomotives. The emergency and difficult situation can be imagined. Maintaining six Nanjing-Shanghai round trips in the past few days was a forced effort in the absence of any other options. The station tracks, platforms, power lines, telephones, signals, and traffic equipment at each station have been gradually repaired. However, the locomotives and vehicles were poorly maintained during the war, and the North Station engine room was too damaged to be easily repaired. It is difficult to fully restore the pre-war train schedule for a while. In order to meet the urgent needs of passenger transport and restore the trains with joint transportation relations between Nanjing-Hangzhou and Tianjin-Pukou, as well as the night express trains, it is planned to first increase the current number of trains. Starting from June 1st, the first Zhabei-Nanjing joint express train, the second Nanjing-Zhabei joint express train, the third Shanghai-Nanjing express train, the fourth Nanjing-Shanghai express train, the seventh Shanghai-Nanjing express train, the eighth Nanjing-Shanghai express train, the thirteenth Shanghai-Nanjing third and fourth class train, the fourteenth Nanjing-Shanghai third and fourth class train, the seventeenth Wuxi-Nanjing local train, the eighteenth Shanghai-Wuxi local train, the twentieth Changzhou-Shanghai local train, the twenty-third Shanghai-Wuxi local train, the twenty-fifth Shanghai-Changzhou local train, and the twenty-sixth Nanjing-Wuxi local train will be operated. The number of these passenger trains is only two express trains, two slow trains, and a few short-distance local trains less than before the war. When the Zhanghuabang General Engine Factory is recovered and the locomotives are repaired to a considerable extent, we will gradually consider restoring the schedule. For the safety of passengers, we have ordered the addition of armed and capable police to protect the trains. In addition to submitting the train schedule separately, we would like to report to you on the progress of road repair and traffic resumption, as well as the number of days required to implement the planned train schedule. Your servant Chen Xinghan bows respectfully."</p>

<p>The comrades of the Chinese Boy Scout Corps who participated in the front-line service of the 19th Route Army have now returned to Shanghai. There are about 300 of them. Yesterday afternoon, they took the Nanjing-Shanghai railway train from Suzhou to Shanghai, arriving at the station at around 7 PM. About 200 people from various schools in Shanghai and the Postal Workers' Union were waiting at both stations to welcome them.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The 19th Route Army is Scheduled to Be Transferred to Fujian to Suppress the Communists at the Beginning of Next Month <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The 19th Route Army, loyal to the cause of resisting Japan and fighting communism, was previously ordered by the Central Government to go to Fujian to suppress the communists. Although various mass organizations in Shanghai have made every effort to retain them, it has been to no avail. According to news from the Shanghai office of the 19th Route Army, the army has decided to transfer to Fujian. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met with Commander-in-Chief Jiang Guangnai, who said that the 19th Route Army will depart for Fujian in batches at the beginning of next month. After arriving there, they plan to immediately suppress the communist bandits. He is very grateful for the sincere retention efforts of the people of Shanghai, but the communist scourge in Fujian is too severe, and it is necessary to rush to suppress it, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Representatives of the Municipal Federation of Labor Petition in Nanjing to Retain the 19th Route Army <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Representatives from over twenty labor unions, including the four districts of silk reeling unions, the dockworkers' union, the ink makers' union, the three districts of silk reeling unions, the first district of dockworkers' union, and the Cantonese steamboat woodworkers' union, totaling twenty-one individuals such as Chen Xiangquan, Hu Peiji, Chen Xiufu, Yuan Yunlong, Liu Defu, Cao Juenong, and others, traveled to Suzhou on the 27th. After attending the memorial service for fallen soldiers the following day, they went to the headquarters of the 19th Route Army at 5 PM to petition for their retention. General Commander Chiang and Military Commander Cai were at the station to see off Chen Mingshu at that time. Chief of Staff Zhao Yijian received the petitioning representatives. The representatives stated their purpose and presented their petition. Zhao said that soldiers had a duty to obey orders and could not make their own decisions. After the representatives repeatedly requested that the army delay their departure until a result of the petition was available, Chief of Staff Zhao stated that he fully accepted the request and promised to forward the petition to the Ministry of Military Administration. The representatives of the association were satisfied. Other than dispatching dockworkers' union, Cantonese steamboat woodworkers' union and Xihe yarn factory union representatives Liu Defu, Chen Xiangquan, and Li Chunsheng back to Shanghai to report to the Federation of Labor, the remaining nineteen representatives, including Chen Xiufu, Hu Peiji, Hong Qixin, and Cao Juenong, went to Nanjing yesterday afternoon to petition. The urgent telegram issued by the association is recorded below:</p>
<p>To Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission, and He of the Ministry of Military Administration, urgently: Ever since the September 18th Incident occurred, the three northeastern provinces have fallen one after another, the nation has lost territory, and the people have lost their lives. This is indeed due to the policy of non-resistance. Unexpectedly, the Japanese, with hawkish intentions and tiger-like gazes, have advanced and led troops to invade Shanghai. A prosperous commercial center has turned into rubble. Wives wail, children cry, and families are scattered. The lives of all the people of Shanghai are in imminent danger. Fortunately, our 19th Route Army, with the principle of being responsible for defending the territory and the determination to resist and repel invaders, is likely to reverse the decline and drive away the evil forces to bring peace to the people. Under such circumstances, where they are relied upon as a bulwark and praised by the masses, we suddenly hear that the 19th Route Army will be transferred away from Shanghai, leaving us, the people, behind. Thinking of the 19th Route Army's loyalty to the country and its bravery in repelling the enemy, which is widely admired and has a resounding reputation, it is enough to suppress the Japanese invaders' fantasy of returning. However, if our bulwark is transferred, we fear that the Japanese saying "(we will) see them again in August" will come true, and we will once again be plunged into a sea of blood and suffering. The situation is urgent. We can only appeal to our government to consider public opinion and approve the cancellation of the transfer, so that they can guard Nanjing and Shanghai and suppress the enemy's flames. This would be fortunate for the Party and the nation, and fortunate for the people. Respectfully, the Shanghai Federation of Labor.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Funeral Held for Zhu Fujia, Member of the Defense Corps Who Died in the Line of Duty <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Public Memorial in the Morning, Funeral in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Plain Carriage, White Horse, Utmost Honor</p>
<p>Zhu Fujia, a martyr and squad leader of the third team of the Shanghai South District Defense Corps, was ordered to defend and maintain order after the Shanghai Incident. On the morning of January 30, he was ambushed and wounded by enemy plainclothesmen at Liangjia Bridge in the two cities. He was sent to Shanghai Hospital, but died of his injuries. The Management Committee of the Defense Corps decided to hold a funeral for him yesterday. All officers and members attended the funeral, wearing mourning attire. The plain carriage and white horse displayed the utmost honor. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Brief Biography of the Martyr: Martyr Zhu Fujia was from Kunshan, Jiangsu, and was twenty-two years old. When the Northeast Incident occurred, the martyr was grieved and eager to serve in the Fudan Righteous Volunteers to fulfill his duty of defending the country. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, he was unable to do so. Later, through a friend's introduction, he joined the second team of the Shanghai South District Defense Corps as a member. He served diligently and achieved excellent results. When the January 28th Shanghai Incident broke out, the city of Nanshi was in turmoil. The martyr was ordered to defend the area, working around the clock and enduring hardships. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 AM on January 30, while returning to the team, he encountered enemy plainclothesmen at Liangjia Bridge who attempted to arrest him. He was ambushed and eventually died of excessive blood loss at Shanghai Public Hospital.</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Funeral Hall: The funeral hall was set up inside the Management Committee of the Defense Corps. Many elegies and eulogies were hung. In the center was a spirit table with offerings. Above it was a portrait of Martyr Zhu, and below it were many wreaths. The scene was solemn and full of tragic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Public Memorial in the Morning: The public memorial began at 9:00 AM yesterday. The Municipal Government specially sent Luo Jinyou as a representative to pay tribute. Other attendees included Management Committee members Yao Mulian and Gu Xinyi, Shanghai Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Yingxing, all officers and members, and representatives from various public organizations in the South District, all of whom attended to express their condolences.</p>
<p>Excerpts from Eulogies: Mayor Wu Tiecheng's eulogy: "Waiting for dawn, still lying on a pillow"</p>
<p>"Ready to sacrifice his life to resist the enemy, even at the point of death, he still shouted to kill the enemy, how can his loyalty be compared to Yan Sheng?" Yu Hongjun's eulogy: "There is much hatred for the country" "His hot blood was offered up early for a final stand, the responsibility for the homeland is heavy, his heroic spirit will last for thousands of years." Luo Jinyou's eulogy: "Heaven and earth are ruthless, treating all things as straw dogs, the mother smiles with joy at her children and grandchildren becoming martyrs for the country." Yu Hede's eulogy: "A man pledges his life to the country, a man has the ambition to achieve benevolence." Other elegies and eulogies sent by Wen Yingxing, Wang Zhen, Ye Huijun, Wang Xiaolai, and various detachments and public organizations numbered in the hundreds.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Honor Guard: Defense Corps cavalry, the military band of the Garrison Headquarters, the military band of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the pistol team of the Defense Corps, the Bloodstained Clothes Pavilion, the military band of the Defense Corps, the martyr's coffin, all officers and members of the Defense Corps, and representatives from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Funeral Route: Departing from the Corps headquarters at 2:00 PM, heading west on Ninghe Road, turning onto Penglai Road, heading north on Zhonghua Road, proceeding along Minguo Road to Xinbeimen, heading west on Fuyou Road, heading south on Houjia Road, heading east on Fangbang Road, heading east out of Xiaodongmen, walking on Dongmen Road, heading south on Laoma Road, heading south on Xuejiabang Road, to Waima Road, heading north to Fengji Wharf, turning towards Qingpu.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Lawsuit Over Rent Exemption for Houses North of Suzhou Creek <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Attention Paid to the Tongchunfang Case</p>
<p>Court Schedules Reopening of Debate</p>
<p>The tenants of Tongchunfang on North Sea Road, based on the resolution of the Municipal Rent Exemption Movement Committee, which stated that all industries in Shanghai had been greatly affected by the Sino-Japanese war, requested that landlords north of Suzhou Creek exempt rent for three months starting in February, while those south of Suzhou Creek, where the situation was slightly better, should exempt rent for two months. Therefore, seventeen tenants, including Yongkanghao, negotiated with Wu Gao, the manager of the Jihua Real Estate Company, demanding that rent for February and March be exempted. However, the agent, adhering to the will of its owner, stated that Tongchunfang was located in the central district and had not been affected by the war. Not only had the tenants not suffered losses, but they had actually profited. Therefore, they refused the request and hired lawyers such as Pan Shidun to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court. The trial has already concluded, and the original date for the verdict was the twenty-sixth. However, the court did not convene on that date. It is now heard that the case must be rescheduled for debate, because since the rent exemption movement began, Chinese and foreign landlords have mostly disagreed with the rent exemption measures resolved by the Rent Exemption Committee, especially in the area south of Suzhou Creek. On the landlord's side, it is believed that since the Public Works Department does not reduce taxes, there is no need to exempt rent. Generally, foreign merchants and landlords are now viewing the outcome of the Tongchunfang case as a guideline for dealing with tenants. Therefore, the importance of the case is not difficult to imagine. The court's decision to reopen the debate is out of caution, in order to hear the statements of both sides again and make a fair judgment. If the original parties cannot resolve the issue peacefully outside of court, the industrial community will pay closer attention when the court convenes in the future, and the tenants will inevitably do their best to fight. Therefore, there will be another round of eloquent arguments.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Representatives for Account Settlement and Rent Reduction Petition Return to Shanghai <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Premier Wang Expresses Deep Regret for Losses Suffered by Merchants and Residents After the War</p>
<p>Promises to Instruct the Municipal Government to Consult with Banks and Money Shops and Determine Measures</p>
<p>The Reopening Committee, jointly formed by the Shanghai General Federation of Commercial Associations and three other groups, previously proposed a flexible method for settling accounts at the end of May and sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers' Association to request their acceptance of this method in order to provide relief. Meanwhile, Hu Fengxiang, a member of the committee, traveled to Nanjing to petition the Executive Yuan for relief. Mr. Hu returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to him, Premier Wang expressed deep regret for the losses suffered by merchants and residents in Shanghai due to the war. He also acknowledged that the economic stagnation had made it impossible to settle outstanding debts. He promised to immediately instruct the Shanghai Municipal Government to consider the situation in Shanghai, consult with banks and money shops, and implement flexible measures to avoid causing panic among merchants. In addition, the Rent Reduction Movement Committee previously believed that the rent reduction measures had not been announced, causing concern among residents. Therefore, they specially sent representatives, including Zhang Yichen, to petition the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, as reported earlier. It is now learned that the representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to them, after arriving in Nanjing, they first petitioned the Executive Yuan. Premier Wang was attending a meeting and sent Councilor Chen Rui to meet with them instead. Chen expressed acceptance of the points in the request and promised to forward them to Premier Wang. The next day, Premier Wang summoned the representatives and spoke with them. He considered the Shanghai residents' request for rent reduction to be reasonable and promised to immediately instruct the Shanghai Municipal Government to promptly convene all relevant parties to discuss and decide on a proper solution to avoid further disputes. It is heard that the Reduction Committee will continue to send representatives to petition the municipal authorities in the coming days.</p>

<p>Two Young Children Injured</p>
<p>Huang, a widow residing at 404 West Qiantang, South of Jiangwan, had two sons: Fubao, ten years old, and Fuyuan, eight years old. Yesterday morning, at dawn, their mother shouldered a load of broad beans to sell in the market. Before leaving, she told her two sons to eat breakfast and then go to the field to cut weeds. At nine o'clock, Fubao and his younger brother, following their mother's instructions, went to weed the field. A bomb buried there suddenly exploded, instantly severing Fubao's left leg. Fuyuan's hands and feet were also seriously injured. Neighbors who heard the explosion rushed to the scene and carried the two injured children back home. At noon, their mother returned and hired a vehicle to send them to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that Fubao's injuries are severe and may be life-threatening.</p>

They also found a small jar of rifle bullets, totaling 290, at 658 Yongxing Road. They immediately reported this to District Chief Wu Shaolin, who then reported it to Huang Ming, the captain of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Police Brigade and Director of the Public Security Bureau's Shanghai North Office. It is heard that Director Huang praised Police Chief Luo and others for their competence and, in addition to seizing all the weapons and ammunition, reported the matter to Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Yingxing, asking for awards to be issued to them according to the regulations for rewarding the seizure of weapons and ammunition, and for notices to be posted to encourage others.</p>

<p>Students from various universities in Shanghai, such as Fudan, Jinan, and Zhonggong, recognizing the importance of studying Chinese problems, initiated the organization of the Chinese Problem Research Association.

<h3 id="e115">Water Police Shoot at Thieves <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>At approximately 12:00 PM yesterday, Chen Younian, dressed in a Zhongshan suit and claiming to be a patrol officer of the Second Detachment of the Third Team of the First District of the Jiangsu Water Police, suddenly arrived at the Sixth District Third Branch Police Station in the Meilong Town in West Shanghai. He claimed to have been ordered to arrest Wang from Pudong, a wanted criminal who had robbed a certain ship. After receiving the report, Police Chief Zhang Bukui immediately dispatched police to assist. However, Chen firmly refused, saying that the location where the thief was hiding had not yet been determined, and that if too many police officers were sent, it would attract attention and might cause the thief to escape. He then left the station and led three armed soldiers and approximately twenty plainclothesmen to the home of Cai Huanwen, a merchant in the town. They frightened and forbade him from making any noise, ransacked the house, and arbitrarily searched for items. They beat Cai Huanwen and the farmer Gu Arong, causing injuries to their heads, faces, arms, and other areas, leaving them covered in wounds and blood. They then handcuffed Cai and Gu and were about to arrest them when Mei Hongyuan, the platoon leader dispatched by the Caoging District Defense Corps, noticed them. Seeing that they were aggressive and that there were no local police officers assisting, he immediately led the corps members to inquire. At that time, Cai and Gu shouted for help, and more and more villagers gathered around. Seeing that the situation was not good, the plainclothesmen fired into the air as a warning, firing approximately twenty shots. There was a sudden burst of gunfire, and bullets flew in all directions, but fortunately no one was injured. Police Chief Zhang Bukui of the town's police station heard the gunshots and immediately led all armed police officers to investigate. Unexpectedly, they were beaten and slapped by these people without asking for any reason. Police Chief Zhang believed that these people were unreasonable and that the arrested person, Cai Huanwen, was a merchant in the town and was not the Wang from Pudong they were ordered to arrest, which was clearly inconsistent with the facts. Fearing that there was another situation, he detained Chen Younian, Wang Guozhi, Wu Zhonghua, Xian Jinchang, Zhang Bin, detectives Luo Jie, Zhao Jinde, informants Jin Kuang, along with Cai and Gu, a total of ten people, along with three Mauser pistols and fifty-seven rounds of ammunition, and sent them to the station. The rest scattered and fled. After a brief interrogation by Station Chief Liu Lunlue, he prepared a document and sent them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation last night.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Visit of Father Gong Xideng to China <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Father Gong Xideng, the president of the Roman Fette Association, came to China last month. He spent a month in Guangdong and other southern regions of our country and has now come to Shanghai. He will stay for several days to visit the Catholic Church and the enterprises it has created in Shanghai. He will then set off for Ningbo to visit Bishop Zai, who has recently been awarded a medal, and then go to Sheshan to visit the Virgin Mary. Father Gong left for Beijing on the sixteenth of this month to admire the scenic spots of the capital. After that, he will travel from Beijing to Hankou, and then take a flight to investigate Sichuan. After completing his work, he will return to Hankou by the same route and then set off north to visit the former capital and other dioceses, planning to conduct an on-the-spot inspection of all the achievements made by missionaries working diligently in China. He plans to hold a gathering with Fette Association journalists scattered throughout the country and then travel by boat from Beijing to Hanyang, Korea, Japan, and other places. After touring, he will return to Shanghai from Japan. He is scheduled to depart for the Philippines at the end of July for a long summer trip. The Gongge Fette Association is dedicated to connecting Catholic news from around the world and the five continents, as well as all photos and cases related to evangelism. It is affiliated with the Roman Curia's Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and has been specially approved by the Missionary Society. The general headquarters is located in the Missionary Society's palace in Rome, with branches spread across the globe. The full authority is generally held by the head of the Missionary Society.

The whereabouts of Father Gong Xideng, the president of the Fette Association, in Shanghai have been described above. He is an international translator and journalist, proficient in various languages.

Furthermore, the association has established a photography team to collect images from various places, which is also an important source for the world's picture weekly.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Board of Directors of the Blue Cross Hospital <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Decides to First Move Back to Original Site</p>
<p>Seeks Land to Build a New Hospital</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Blue Cross Qianyi Trauma Hospital held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the temporary hospital in the old Minhe Lane on Guangxi Road. Directors Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Qin Runqing, Xie Taofu, Li Shoushan, Chen Bingqian, Tong Zhonglian, Xu Chunrong, Wang Binyan, Jiang Huaishun, and others attended. Chief Director Chen Bingqian presided over the meeting. First, Medical Director Zhang Deyi and Deputy Director Zhang Zhengying reported on the medical and economic situation over the years. During the recent Japanese invasion of Shanghai, the original hospital in Yonghe Lane on Haining Road was located in the war zone. The hospital was blockaded by barbed wire and could not carry out medical services. Later, Mrs. Hardoon Luo and Mr. Ji Juemi provided great help by lending three rooms in the old Minhe Lane to serve as a temporary hospital, with the rent completely waived. As a result, it was possible to actively establish the temporary hospital, which greatly benefited the injured refugees in the disaster area. However, now that the area has returned to normal, the board should decide whether to move back. After detailed discussions by the attending directors, the following resolutions were made: (1) Northern Shanghai is the area with the most workers and poor people. The hospital should be repaired as soon as possible and moved back to benefit patients. (2) Purchase suitable land to build a new hospital site to establish a permanent foundation. (3) The hospital's affairs are becoming increasingly heavy, and there are many patients. A manager should be added to facilitate the hospital's affairs. The medical director should select a suitable person. (4) Once the Yonghe Lane hospital site is repaired, it should be moved back immediately, and advertisements should be placed in newspapers. (5) Mrs. Hardoon Luo and Mr. Ji Juemi have enthusiastically supported the hospital by waiving the rent for the temporary hospital for several months. Letters of thanks should be sent to thank them for their support of the hospital. The meeting adjourned after the agenda was completed.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Publication of a Monumental Work on Qing Dynasty Figures <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yan Maogong of Wuxi has spent many years of effort in writing the "Classified Compilation of Qing Dynasty Figures," a book comprising forty-seven volumes. It includes twenty-three volumes of annual tables for grand secretaries, eight ministers, deputy ministers, governors-general, and governors; twelve volumes of classified compilations of figures and twelve volumes of classified compilations of selected officials. Except for the two types of works on deputy ministers and classified compilations of figures, which have been postponed for publication, the remaining five types, totaling twenty-nine volumes, have been published by the Wuxi Minsheng Company. Among them, the four types of annual tables, from the first year of Shunzhi to the third year of Xuantong, record the months and years of transfers, posthumous titles, ranks, and places of origin for each name. Detailed notes are also provided for those who received honors, lost ranks, were exiled, or were executed. Loyalty, treachery, virtue, and villainy are known at a glance. The collection of classified compilations of selected officials is also rich, collecting all names from the Bingxu Branch in the third year of Shunzhi to the Jiaxun Branch in the thirty-year of Guangxu, the last year of the imperial examination, and listing them according to the four tones and rhyme categories, noting the official ranks and places of origin for each one. It is a necessary reference book for those studying Qing Dynasty literature. Mr. Huang Junren once used this as the basis for his article "A Glimpse of Humanistic Statistics in Various Provinces during the Qing Dynasty," published in the sixth issue of the second volume of the "Humanities Monthly," listing the top scholars of each department, as well as grand secretaries, governors-general, and governors, according to their provinces. One province accounted for forty-nine top scholars, one county accounted for sixteen top scholars, and one province accounted for twenty-eight grand secretaries, seventy-six governors-general, and seventy-six governors. It also lists the places of origin of those who passed the first Higher Examination published by the National Government. Mr. Yan is currently at the Wuxi Public Library. Those who wish to obtain this book can inquire there directly.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Fire at Lan Ni Du <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>A fire suddenly broke out at the Wanquantang Wine Shop at 404 Lanni Ferry, Pudong, at approximately 7:00 PM the night before last. In an instant, flames burst through the roof. The police on duty blew their whistles sharply. The Pudong Fire Department drove to the scene to put out the fire. The Taikoo Company's fast-boat Xiaoda and the Customs fireboat also arrived at the riverbank and connected long hoses to help put out the fire. Soon, the fire spread to the neighboring post office. Firefighters worked hard to isolate the flames. Fortunately, the wind was calm at the time, preventing the fire from spreading. The fire was gradually extinguished after about half an hour. It is estimated that two entire buildings of Wanquantang were burned down, and the floor of the post office was also completely destroyed. Yesterday, the Third District ordered the detention of Lu Qin, the manager of the shop, and Wang Aigen, a friend of the tenant Chen Gentao. According to Zhang's confession, the shop owner had passed away many years ago, and the owner's wife appointed him as the manager. There was a fire insurance policy for 1,500 taels. The fire was started by the tenant, and so on. According to Wang's confession, his friend Chen Gentao lived upstairs in the hotel. Yesterday, Chen's wife was ill, and he asked me to cook for her. When he went upstairs to get an oil bottle, a fire suddenly broke out below, and so on. District Chief Yu believed that there were many rumors outside and that there might be a suspicion of arson for compensation. He ordered them to be sent to the General Bureau for interrogation together. Furthermore, the post office, since being burned down, has moved to 54 Dongchang Road yesterday and is operating as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e121">KUI MAO KANG'S ROMANTIC CASE <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Acquitted But Still Released on Bail</p>
<p>Kui Mao Kang, an employee of the Zhejiang Xingye Bank Trust Department, is over forty years old, but his enthusiasm remains strong. In his spare time from work, he seeks out women on his own. If he succeeds, he uses money as a means of connection, enjoying a brief encounter. In August of last year, Kui met a woman, learning that she was a fellow villager from Suzhou. He took her to the Anle Palace Hotel. During their intimate moments, the woman said her nickname was A Feng, and she was nineteen years old. She had just come to Shanghai with her mother and was still a virgin. Kui was completely infatuated with her. He rented a spare room at 150 Ruikang Lane, Jiaxing Road, to hide this beauty. Recently, the woman became pregnant, but Kui had already taken a fancy to someone else and abandoned her. A Feng's mother, Shi Ge, hired a lawyer in the capacity of legal guardian to sue Kui in the First Special District Court. She claimed that because of poverty, she brought her daughter to Shanghai to seek relatives and find work. Later, her daughter was employed in a wool mill, but the residence was far from the mill, and the daughter had to leave early and return late. The defendant enticed her with promises of marriage, and the daughter succumbed to his adultery. Now, he has abandoned her for someone else. The defendant first committed adultery, then enticed her away, and finally discarded her like worn-out shoes. This violates Article 244 of the Criminal Law concerning offenses against morality and Article 257 concerning offenses against the family. She requested that the court impose a sentence according to the law to rectify morality. Initially, the court summoned the defendant several times, but he did not appear. Later, he was ordered to be apprehended and brought to court for questioning. The defendant insisted that his relationship with A Feng was based on meeting her at a hotel. He knew she was a prostitute and engaged in sexual relations with her, paying her mother for the nights. Later, they rented a house to live together, but her mother and daughter never separated. The plaintiff's claims of enticement are false. Yesterday, Judge Qiao continued the trial. The defendant invited Lu Zhennan and Yu Yuxiang to court to testify that they had seen the plaintiff's mother and daughter in the house when they visited the defendant at Ruikang Lane. The defendant's defense lawyer, Chen Rui, based on all the facts, argued that the defendant did not cause A Feng to leave her parents' custody. The legal articles cited by the plaintiff do not apply. Furthermore, the woman's father is still in her hometown. According to the law, both parents should act as litigation agents if both are alive. However, only her mother is acting as an agent, which is procedurally incorrect. The plaintiff's lawyer also rebutted. Judge Qiao immediately pronounced the defendant, Kui Mao Kang, not guilty. The plaintiff's request was granted, and the defendant was released on bail pending the appeal period.</p>
<h3 id="e122">LI BIXIA SUES HER HUSBAND FOR ABUSE AND ABANDONMENT <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Mediation Fails, Formal Lawsuit Filed</p>
<p>Li Bixia, currently 30 years old and from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, married Wu Zhenxiang, from Yin County, in 1925. Her father, Wu Tingfan, has a good reputation in Shanghai's financial circles and currently resides at Yongju Qianzhuang, Tonghe Lane, Ningbo Road. Recently, Li Bixia filed for mediation in the First District Court, claiming abuse and abandonment by her husband. Her statement says that she married Wu in 1925 through the matchmaker Yu Zuoting. Unexpectedly, her husband engaged in prostitution and often beat and scolded her. Her father reprimanded him, but he did not repent. Instead, he became enraged and embezzled funds for pleasure in December 1926. After persuasion from relatives and friends, he returned home to live with her in 1928, but soon relapsed into his old ways, taking concubines and hiding mistresses, not returning home all night. In November of last year, due to a disagreement, he cursed her and left home, neglecting the family. Her father is a financial magnate in Shanghai, with assets of hundreds of thousands, but he also refused to support her. Wu Zhenxiang is also wealthy and has been making huge profits in the gold business in recent years, spending lavishly on concubines and mistresses while abandoning her. Therefore, she requests an order for him to pay 30,000 yuan in living expenses. During the court mediation, Wu Zhenxiang claimed to be ill and sent lawyer Wang Peiyuan to court, saying that Wu is currently hospitalized in Room 286, Second Floor, Renji Hospital, Shandong Road, and the other party has never visited him. It is clear who is abandoning whom. Since Li entered the family, she has been abusing the children of his previous wife, going out all day and neglecting household affairs, even causing trouble to her neighbors. After he brought her to Shanghai, she remained the same, often causing trouble at his shop. Last November, the shop closed, and she went to her father's shop to cause trouble. Lawyer Yuan mediated, and she was given 30 yuan per month. After a few months, she filed a lawsuit again, showing she is very fond of causing trouble. The judge mediated between the two parties, but they insisted on their own views, so he announced a formal lawsuit.</p>

<p>The Jimei No. 2 fishing boat sailed to the outer sea to fish on the morning of the 24th of this month. On the 20th, at 122 degrees 30 minutes east longitude and 31 degrees 45 minutes north latitude, it caught a giant fish. The shape is strange, with a pointed head and many gills, very large pelvic fins, and a blackish-gray body. It is more than 20 feet long, more than 10 feet in circumference, and weighs about 2,000 pounds. The boat arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>In recent years, patriots across the country have advocated national martial arts. The trend has been surging and flourishing. It is because resisting foreign aggression, striving for strength, and not forging the body and reviving the martial spirit will not be successful. Although the National Martial Arts Research Institute is everywhere in Shanghai, it is not yet widespread in terms of population, so those who are interested in this way always sigh that they have nowhere to turn. Now, Mr. Tong Zhongyi, a famous national martial arts master, in order to make up for this lack, specially established the Zhongyi Martial Arts Association at No. 23, Lane 124, Weihaiwei Road, Nantong Fulu intersection, for comrades to practice and research. Mr. Tong is also good at trauma surgery and uses his experience to share what he has learned with the world in his spare time. Mr. Tong is indeed a man of ambition today.</p>

<p>Hang Wanchang, a Yangzhou native living on Jiangyin Street, Ximen, was a salesman for Xie Changsheng Company, managed by Chen Xinfa, a Shaoxing native, at No. 112 Weirmeng Road in the French Concession. From the end of last year to the present, he has secretly collected customer accounts from various stores, totaling a huge sum of 2,400 yuan, enriching his own pockets and avoiding meeting people. Chen has now discovered that Hang is hiding in Room 33, Kade Hotel, No. 1007, Fuxi Fang, Kade Road, in the Public Concession. The French patrol Liu Achang and the Chinese and Western detectives of the Public Patrol arrested Hang, brought him back to the patrol room, and sent him to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court the next day. Gu Shouxi, the patrol lawyer, stated the case, saying that the patrol charged the defendant with breach of trust under Article 366 of the Criminal Law. Because the plaintiff's accounts have not been verified, he requested a postponement of the hearing. Judge Li Changnian briefly questioned the defendant and ordered a postponement of the trial to June 1. The defendant will be temporarily detained in the patrol room.</p>

<h3 id="e131">HUBEI EDUCATION CRISIS SOON TO BE RESOLVED <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Shen Shiyuan Signs Agreement with Students to Resume Classes on Schedule</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: The Hubei education community has been on strike, refusing to accept Education Director Shen Shiyuan, for several days. With the best efforts of provincial committee members Kong Geng and others, the students' request to resume classes has taken a sudden turn, and it seems that there is a way to solve the problem. First, provincial committee members Kong Geng, Li Shucheng, Secretary-General Yang Zaichun, Zhonghua University President Chen Shi, and Thirteenth Division Commander Wan Yaohuang, etc., considering that tens of thousands of students in various schools have suddenly lost their studies, which is a pity, took the initiative to mediate in a private capacity, soliciting opinions on Hubei's educational facilities from the faculty and staff, and asking them to resume classes as soon as possible. The faculty and staff only expressed two points: (1) Future educational facilities should stand on the entire educational platform; (2) Abolish the traditional policies. Kong and others relayed this to Provincial Chairman Xia Douyin and those concerned, and they generally accepted it. At the same time, students from various schools jointly launched a movement to resume classes, and a resumption of classes movement was established. On the 27th, representatives were sent to the provincial government to petition, presenting a letter stating that Hubei is the hub of the north and south and is watched by China and foreign countries. There is neither brutal invasion nor flooding. How can education be suspended? The faculty and staff resigned to fight for the candidate for the director, and the government has its own discretion. The students are appealing for their own interests, and the government should take care of them, etc. They also issued a declaration, asking all sectors to provide assistance. On the same day, Chairman Xia received them and said that no matter what, classes will be resumed on the 20th. The representatives were satisfied with the result and left, and then went to the Education Department to petition. Director Shen Shiyuan received them. The student representatives asked Shen to determine the date for the resumption of classes, and Shen signed on the spot, saying that classes could start next Monday (i.e., the 30th). The student representatives left happily. As for whether the faculty and staff will resume classes, it is not yet certain. However, the provincial government has repeatedly tried to persuade them to stay after the general resignation, and has also adopted their suggestions for improving education as much as possible. It seems that there is a considerable result. It is expected that after the faculty and staff held a meeting on the 29th, they will definitely promote the realization of the resumption of classes. Furthermore, the faculty and staff, fearing that the public would not understand the truth about the resignation, issued a special declaration, saying that this general resignation was purely a matter of conscience and a strategy of justice. It was not that they did not understand the government's difficulties or disregard the students' studies, but rather that Shen Shiyuan's studies and behavior were not similar, and he was not enough to satisfy the faculty and staff's expectations. He also adhered to Huang Jianzhong's traditional policies, which were enough to hinder the progress of Hubei's education in the future. This is a major reason for the inability to cooperate with Shen. It would be a big mistake to refer to it as a factional struggle, etc. (May 28)</p>
<h3 id="e132">JIANGSU EDUCATION DEPARTMENT'S DETAILED RULES SHOULD STILL BE REVISED <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Phrase "Four to Six Editors and Reviewers" Should Be Deleted</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan yesterday, according to the Ministry of Education's report, investigated and approved the Secretary's Office of the Executive Yuan to forward the detailed rules of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department. After review, a letter was sent back and forwarded. Now, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has sent a consultation stating that the Education Department has revised the detailed rules. In addition to forwarding them to the Executive Yuan for review, they are also sent for filing, etc. After reviewing the revised provincial government organization law, there are no provisions for setting up editors and reviewers. The Ministry previously requested in a letter to the Secretary's Office of the Executive Yuan to forward an order to amend Articles 2 and 11 of the original detailed rules, which concern the provisions for editors and reviewers. Now, it is found that Article 3 of the revised detailed rules still adds the phrase "four to six editors and reviewers" under the secretaries, five section chiefs, and four to eight inspectors of the department, which is not only inconsistent with the revised provincial government organization law, but also conflicts with the meaning of Article 11 of the same detailed rules, which states that editors and reviewers may be set up as appropriate. In addition to replying, it should be presented for review and an order should be issued to delete the phrase "four to six editors and reviewers" listed in Article 3, which is for the public convenience, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e133">RESEARCH UNDERTAKINGS OF THE EDUCATION COLLEGE OF CENTRAL UNIVERSITY <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Education College of Nanjing Central University was expanded from the former Education Department of Dongda Nanggao. Over the years, the rise and fall of education in China have been closely related to the college. Research undertakings have always been of concern to people in society. The following is a brief description of its recent situation. Since 1931, the college has established an Education Research Institute and established a Publishing Committee to determine plans and to achieve practical development in educational research undertakings. Although CUHK has been affected by political trends and funding has been insufficient, the college's research undertakings have never been interrupted. In addition to some problems in educational psychology, the China Education and Culture Foundation specially set up a lectureship in educational psychology to continue experimental research and conduct large-scale testing. All professors in the college have also led students to conduct research on practical educational issues in terms of philosophy, psychology, administration, teaching, and teaching materials. There are no less than 70 or 80 kinds of work that have been started, and more than 20 kinds of results have been obtained, which are divided into four kinds of publications and published to the public: (1) Series: All long works belong to this category. Those that have been sent to press include "Outline of Educational Science Research" and "Modern Educational Administration." Those in the process of compilation include "Middle School English Teaching Method" and five or six other types. (2) Series: Designated as "Research on Educational Topics." All research reports with shorter lengths belong to this category. Those that have been published include "Research on Commonly Used Simplified Characters," "Comparative Research on Independent Municipal Single Regulations," "Secondary Education in Jiangsu," and "Research on Natural Science Teaching Materials in Junior High Schools." Those in the process of compilation include "Research on Horizontal and Vertical Reading of Chinese Characters," "Child Psychology," and five or six other types. (3) Educational Quarterly: Four issues have been published, containing more than 70 important papers by teachers and students of the college. (4) College News: One issue has been published, which is specifically used to report important news of the college and the recent situation of graduates. The above publications are all the crystallization of the college's research achievements in the past year. The content is extremely valuable and is widely sold. Except for the series, which is distributed by the China Bookstore, the College News is not for sale, and the Educational Quarterly is almost sold out. Various series are priced extremely cheaply. All bookstores and schools are welcome to contact the college directly for wholesale and promotion.</p>

<p>The Chinese Film Education Association was initiated by Liu Suijiu, the Chinese representative of the International Investigation Team and a professor at Northeastern University, Dai Ce, a film and drama teacher at the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts in Paris, France, Wu Zhiqian, the principal of Shanghai Women's Middle School, and Xu Gongmei and Zhao Yiwei from the Shanghai education community, with the aim of promoting and studying modern film education. Since its organization last year, it has been actively proceeding. After the Songhu Incident, it participated in the National Salvation Joint Association and other groups in this city, and worked hard for the national salvation work. Now that the situation is peaceful and the association's affairs are important, the spring members' meeting was held on May 28 to amend the constitution. Xu Gongmei served as chairman, reported on the recent work situation, then re-elected officers, and discussed the plan for this year, etc. Ma Zongrong, chairman of the Department of Social Education of Daxia University, Zheng Zhengqiu, a senior in the drama and art world, and celebrities from the education and art circles were present. It is heard that the association's correspondence address is still at Shanghai Women's Middle School in Ximen.</p>

<p>Twelve</p>
<p>The north side of the main hall is the throne of the Tathagata Buddha. We placed an Eight Immortals table and two armchairs in the west end of the hall, ready for the chairman and secretary to sit on. More than 20 long benches in the temple were moved out and arranged horizontally in seven rows. The children sat in the front row, followed by the younger women, and finally the old women and older men, sitting mixed together. Only we young men enjoyed the right to stand in the back.</p>
<p>I first reported: "Today's meeting aims to establish a school jointly managed by all the people in the village. The school is for the public, which is the foundation of the world for the public. The masters of the Republic of China want to learn and teach. The masters of the school also want to learn and teach. We are meeting today to ask everyone to learn to be the boss of the school, to learn to be the masters of the school." After the report, I explained the method of the meeting, such as: electing the chairman and secretary, speaking on the proposed motion and not speaking randomly, and only one person can speak at the same time. Everyone must first obtain the chairman's permission to speak. If you agree with each proposal, raise your hand. If you do not agree, do not raise your hand. A majority of raised hands will be considered passed, and a minority of raised hands will be considered failed. To simplify, any proposal without objection will also be considered passed. I briefly reported these methods to everyone and used simple analogies to explain them so that everyone could understand.</p>
<p>Now it is time to elect the chairman. I said: "This is a rural school. Only a true farmer can sit in this chair of the chairman. What is a true farmer? A person who relies on his own hands to farm and eat is a true farmer. In our village, no one farms better than Brother Huang Chunsheng. He is fair, enthusiastic, and can speak well. I propose that he be the chairman. Do you agree? Does anyone else want to nominate someone?"</p>
<p>Everyone said: "Brother Chunsheng is the chairman. We agree."</p>
<p>I said: "All those who agree that Brother Chunsheng should be the chairman, please raise your hand." Most of the 108 hands agreed that Chunsheng should be the chairman. I was elected as the secretary.</p>
<p>Brother Chunsheng, wearing straw sandals and with yellow mud not yet dry on his legs, walked to the table to take office. He said: "Being the chairman is like a countryman eating sea cucumber for the first time, wanting to eat it but also a little afraid. But I am willing to try. If I do something wrong, I will just fall on the ground, saving you from knocking me down. Okay, the school must be established, but how should it be established? Please express your opinions."</p>
<p>Old Xu, a bricklayer, ate Zhenjiang vinegar and had not yet recovered from the sourness. He stood up angrily and said: "I don't think the school can be established. If the school is established and the Bodhisattva is destroyed, who will protect us? Old ladies and young mistresses, don't listen to Zhong'er's nonsense. If the school is established, where will you go to burn incense? I advocate not establishing a school and hiring a good monk instead."</p>
<p>Chairman: "Does anyone agree with what Old Xu said?"</p>
<p>"We agree! Don't establish a school!" said the owner of a grocery store, standing up. He was worried about the sales of his gold and silver incense paper.</p>
<p>What a huge momentum! Unexpectedly, we encountered such a powerful adversary today.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Yu Binqi Discusses Beginner Swimming Methods <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Introduction to Swimming</p>
<p>Water Breathing Method</p>
<p>| Particularly Suitable for Natural Swimming Pools in Rural Areas |</p>
<p>Summer exercise is best with swimming, which can not only exercise the body and invigorate the spirit, but is also a supreme technique for rescuing oneself and others in emergencies. Therefore, the number of enthusiasts is increasing. However, beginners, even if they study carefully, often fail to make progress over the years because they cannot find an experienced instructor, wasting their time. In the past (referring to Shanghai), the Municipal Council sponsored the Hongkou Open-Air Swimming Pool, and there were many talented people at that time. However, this summer, due to the impact of the Shanghai Incident, the opening of the pool is indefinitely postponed. We feel even more helpless to learn to swim, sighing at the pool. Here is a brief description of some beginner swimming methods:</p>
<p>(1) Beginners should not leave the shore with their hands or the bottom with their feet. Artificial swimming pools, constructed with materials like cement, are relatively easy. Hands can tightly grip the edge of the pool, the body should be straight, and the feet should kick the water. It is especially difficult to do this in natural pools, because the edges of natural pools, whether rivers or lakes, are made of mud and stones, with no place to grip. Beginners have no way to proceed. Now, one or two bamboo poles can be used, with two waterproof tin cans (or kerosene cans) tied to each end to make them float on the water. Both hands should be straightened and gripping the middle section of the bamboo pole, and the whole body should be flat and prone on the surface of the water. The feet should kick up and down. After doing this several times, the face should be immersed in the water (breathing method detailed later). With practice, the bamboo pole can be moved to the chest, with the middle of the bamboo pole wrapped in cotton fabric to prevent it from sliding back and forth. The hands should paddle and the feet should kick at the same time. Once the movements are proficient, one will naturally learn to swim.</p>
<p>(2) Breathing Method: The whole body should be flat and floating on the water, with the hands and feet performing the previous movements. The face should be immersed in the water. When short of breath, the head can be slowly turned to the left or right from the flat plane when the hands are stretched forward and paddled backward. The limit should be the ability to breathe. When the hands paddle forward again, the head should slowly re-enter the water. However, it is necessary to identify a direction when moving. For example, if the left side is identified, then the movement should be performed when the left hand is paddling. The right side should be done every time the right hand is paddling, which is better than doing it on both sides. The above two points are very helpful for beginners. Those who wish to further their skills can purchase "Swimming Training Method" compiled by Qian Yiqin, published by Qinfen Bookstore at the Huajinli intersection on Shanghai Sima Road. With this book, one can learn without a teacher. (If you have any swimming discussions, you can write to Yu Jun Binqi, care of the Shanghai Sports Association on Labor Father Road.)</p>

<h3 id="e144">Gold Market Last Week: Little Change in Auction Price <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Result: Slight Decrease of Only Nine Cents</p>
<p>The gold market last week had some small fluctuations, but the overall drop compared to the previous week was only nine cents. On Monday, the big bar silver frequently decreased by 0.125, as did American silver, shilling, and American dollars by 0.375, indicating internal tightness. The initial auction price for July rose sharply by 12.8 taels to 732 taels, especially with the Saito cabinet in Japan or the expectation of peace in the international situation, leading to strong confidence, reaching 33.5 taels. Later, it seemed to decline as sellers became active, but there were fluctuations of only four or five taels, with the noon price at 28.1 taels, then closing at 29.1 taels. In the afternoon, it opened at 29 taels, and finally rose to 33 taels due to the firm exchange rate, closing at 32.3 taels, a continuation of the previous Saturday's increase of 13.1 taels. The daily fluctuation was only 5.5 taels. "Tuesday": The big bar near-term price remained unchanged, while the far-term price decreased slightly by 0.0625. The silver price increased by 0.125, English gold remained as before, American dollars increased slightly by 0.125. Internally, English was flat and American was looser due to the continued rise in exchange rates. The auction price opened at 728.2 taels, a drop of 4.1 taels, then 6.8 taels, and then due to more buying, it broke through 30 taels, reaching 30.07 taels. In the afternoon, it was 29.4 taels, then 28 taels, then rebounded from 29.4 taels to 25.3 taels, closing at 26.6 taels, a drop of 5.7 taels from the previous day. The daily difference was 7.1 taels. "Wednesday": The big bar silver, which had been decreasing for five consecutive days, suddenly turned upward, increasing by 0.1875. American silver remained unchanged, shilling as before, American dollars increased slightly by 0.125, due to the large exchange rate. The internal market increased slightly. The auction price opened at 728.2 taels, an increase of 1.6 taels, because the silver price futures saw a small increase. Soon after, the exchange rate loosened, and banks all sold out, with large households also selling, dropping sharply by four or five taels to 23.7 taels, then rising to 27.7 taels at noon, but there were ups and downs, closing at 26 taels at noon. In the afternoon, it was 25.5 taels. The market was quiet because there was no foreign exchange market on Wednesday, so it was mediocre. It closed at 26.4 taels, a decrease of only 0.2 taels from the previous day, with a daily difference of 5.1 taels. "Thursday": The big bar continued to rise by 0.125, American silver also increased by 0.125, shilling and American dollars remained the same, internally English was stable and American was flat, because the exchange rate was repeatedly reported high. The auction price opened with a small drop of 2.6 taels to 723.8 taels, then 25.7 taels. Later, due to news of British buying silver and not restoring the gold standard, the market became tired, and finally broke 720 taels, a total of 19.5 taels. At noon, it returned to 23.2 taels, then closed at 22.5 taels. In the afternoon, it opened at 22.8 taels, and the Guangdong group sold out, resulting in 20.09 taels. Suddenly, news came that the British were buying gold to suppress the exchange rate, and confidence improved, rising to 24 taels, closing at 23 taels, a decrease of 3.4 taels from the previous day, with a fluctuation of 6.2 taels. "Friday": The big bar decreased by 0.0625, the silver price remained the same, the shilling also had no increase or decrease, internally it seemed firm. The gold market opened at 26.2 taels, an increase of 3.2 taels. Afterwards, it was very flat, with little fluctuation, from 27.2 taels to 23.7 taels, because the exchange rate was stable and loose, closing at 24.6 taels at noon. In the afternoon, it opened at 24 taels, then 23.6 taels, closing at 26.4 taels, with Hengyu, Dalian, and other groups buying in, an increase of 3.4 taels from the previous day, the opposite of the previous day's situation, with a daily fluctuation of no more than 3.6 taels. "Saturday": The big bar silver decreased by 0.125, the silver price by 0.25, the shilling decreased by half a gear, internally it increased, causing the gold market to go from sharp to weak, opening with a sharp increase of 6.1 taels, totaling 732.5 taels, then 733 taels, because the silver price private telegram was slightly 0.3125, futures also slightly 1.5 taels. Soon after, selling sentiment prevailed, and there was news unfavorable to the market, regarding American dollar transportation methods, and confidence immediately declined, falling sharply by more than 10 taels, until the minimum price at noon was 18.3 taels, a drop of 8.1 taels from the previous day, but after closing, it only saw 16 taels, and then 18 taels again. In short, people were hesitant, with a difference of 14.7 taels in half a day, which was the first fluctuation in these six days. The high and low prices of the English and American silver markets and exchange rate auction prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, silver drafts suddenly became loose and stagnant, and also fell slightly, only by 3 cents, with the same price in the morning and afternoon markets. Draft transactions were made, but there were no huge transactions due to the imminent result, only over 1 million. After the sharp drop the day before, customs silver slightly increased yesterday morning, calculated as 6 qian 9 fen 7 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half, an improvement of 6 hao 2 hu and a half compared to the previous afternoon. The afternoon market showed weakness again, calculated as a small decrease of 1 hao 2 hu and a half, to 6 qian 9 fen 7 li and a half. Exchange drafts were made, 320,000 in the morning market, and 195,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were extremely quiet due to the bank holiday period. Even if there were transactions, they were very few. There were no transactions in both markets yesterday. Banks had no market due to the weekly holiday. Qian Zhuang received over 4.7 million in foreign public bills and over 21 million in silver public bills. Remittances from various routes totaled 400,000 to 500,000. Small Qian Zhuang transactions totaled over 300,000. In the auxiliary currency market, Jiangnan small foreign silver fell slightly by 2 li in the morning market, to 6 qian 4 li.

<h3 id="e146">Weekly Report on the Bond Market Before and After Securities Settlement <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>All Prices Increased by Around One Yuan</p>
<p>Turnover of 1.1 Million Tens of Thousands</p>
<p>Last week, the Chinese merchant securities market, except for Friday when it was closed for settlement, the May futures only traded for the first two days of the week. Starting Wednesday, the market was closed to prepare for settlement. Although the July futures opened on Thursday, only the "Demobilization" type saw some transactions on the weekend, while others did not open. Therefore, after Wednesday, almost the entire market was for June futures. Daily turnover was 3.7 million tens of thousands on Monday, approximately 2.9 million on Tuesday, and quieter on the remaining days, averaging 1.4 million to 1.5 million. The total turnover for the entire week was 11.14 million tens of thousands in futures and 172,600 yuan in spot. Regarding the trend of various bond prices last week, the market outlook was good. The domestic situation improved, and although there was little progress in diplomacy, there was no deterioration either. Therefore, investment from various parties increased, and their interest was greater than before. However, since large households still took a wait-and-see attitude, there were no large transactions, and the market did not see large increases or decreases. Overall, except for a slight drop of a few cents on the first day of the week, prices tended to rise every day thereafter, but the increase was only around 3 to 4 cents. As a result, compared to the previous week, the June futures such as "Disbandment," "Demobilization," "19 Customs Consolidated," "20 Customs Tax," "Salt Tax," etc., all increased by over one yuan. The spot prices for "19 Customs Consolidated" and "20 Customs Tax" increased by 1.8 yuan, and the spot prices for "Demobilization" and "Consolidated Salt Tax" also increased by 1.3 to 1.4 yuan. Others also increased by 5 to 6 cents. As for the price fluctuations of various bonds in May, it is impossible to make a definitive decision based on only two days of market activity at the beginning of the week. The high and low prices and fluctuations of each type last week are listed below: (Unit: Yuan)</p>

<p>The American Eastern Banking Corporation's Shanghai Commercial Securities Daily Index is calculated by selecting the daily market prices of twenty types of securities in this port. These twenty types of securities are sufficient to represent the activities of the Shanghai Western Merchants Securities Market. If the situation changes in the future, other selections should be added. The currently selected twenty types of securities are as follows:</p>
<p>American Eastern Banking Corporation (Type B Securities) American Asia Insurance Company</p>
<p>International Trust Company Puyi Real Estate Company (Type B Securities)</p>
<p>Hwa Mow Real Estate Company Yip Kwong Company</p>

<p>According to the above securities, the market price on a single day often changes unpredictably. The most reliable source is the printed and published report from the Public Industry Association (Western Merchants Securities Exchange) after the first auction each day. Based on this report, the American Eastern Banking Corporation calculates the average price before 10:00 AM and broadcasts it via radio. It is planned to send it to various daily newspapers for distribution on a daily basis starting this month, so that those who pay attention to the securities market can easily view it.

<p>Market Conditions Were Extremely Quiet and Ordinary</p>
<p>Southern China Actively Procured at the Weekend</p>
<p>Cotton yarn market conditions were extremely flat at the beginning of the week. Due to the deteriorating environment and the stalemate between the two sides in the Guangdong-Hainan military issue, confidence remained weak, and the situation in the business community was very dispersed. Later, the Sichuan group had two ships sailing directly to Chongqing, purchasing more than 3,000 bales, which caused the scattered and stagnant yarn market to suddenly turn good. At the weekend, a port in Southern China actively procured, and a large number of 10-count coarse yarns were bought, estimated to be about 2,000 to 3,000 bales. As a result, confidence gradually turned firm and prices rose. Some manufacturers transported the goods themselves, and the sales volume in various provinces was also considerable. The existing yarn supply in the market was slightly tight, and the market showed an upward trend. However, considering the world cotton industry situation, the yarn market still lacks active strength. Furthermore, domestic finance is still dry, the cocoon industry is declining, and farmers' livelihoods are miserable. Meanwhile, Japanese factories are secretly operating aggressively, with particularly low prices attracting sales. The local yarn should be sold off as the market dictates, which can reduce stockpiling, lighten the burden on factories, and strengthen competitiveness. Recently, a friend from Tianjin said that the city is flooded with Japanese yarn, with Huabiao cloth and Russian-Japanese goods everywhere, showing the strength of foreign goods in North China. According to statistics, the total number of bales bought by various groups in the entire week was 7,625 bales, of which 181 bales were bought among peers. Market prices increased by 1 to 2 taels compared to the previous week. The opening price of marked yarn at the beginning of the week was flat, but later, due to real demand from Sichuan and Guangdong, and a shortage of sellers in the market, some short positions were covered, and the market rose. Prices for each month increased by more than 2 taels compared to the previous week, but the number of transactions remained low. The daily business hours were very short, and it was not easy to recover. The total number of transactions for the entire week was 22,200 bales. The number of bales bought by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Group Bales Group Bales Group Bales</p>
<p>Sichuan 3,150 Changsha 290 Shantou 490</p>

<p>Current Cotton Consumption Power Weak and Unable to Bear It</p>
<p>In the past week, the cotton market had nothing to be proud or ashamed of. The range of price increases and decreases was minimal. In this period of old cotton, neither buyers nor sellers dared to take rash actions, resulting in a significant lack of trading. Although both Indian and American cotton were declining, the local market was not affected much. Most people's thinking was influenced by the recent irregular weather and the continued rise of the Yangtze River water level in Hankou, fearing potential future troubles. Therefore, retail investors leaned towards buying long. However, it was still early, and it was really necessary for various factories to fully absorb foreign cotton. It was found that the price difference between domestic and foreign cotton has been increasing, with domestic cotton prices being too expensive. How can real sales develop? All that exists is only fragmented trading. Therefore, judging from the overall global situation, the cotton market is still in a state of sorrow. However, currently, most retail investors are holding tight, but the number of transactions is very small, and the momentum for change is becoming weaker. The price of spot cotton in a week only fluctuated by one or two coins compared to the previous week, and trading was very quiet. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 40,800 dan. Spot consumption remains weak. American cotton fell by 25 points compared to the previous week. The transaction volume and high and low prices of spot cotton purchased by various factories are listed below:</p>

<p>Less than 20% Can Be Reeled</p>
<p>Many Silkworms Have Thin Skins</p>
<p>In various cities and towns in Yangzhou, the spring silkworms raised this year were all abandoned due to the impact of the weather. Only 40-50% of foreign silkworms went to the cocoon stage. However, during the cocooning stage, they were affected by heavy thunderstorms and unusual cold. The silk spun by the silkworms was intermittent and insufficient, and some even died on the cocooning frame. Therefore, the cocoon production was extremely low, with less than 20% being reeled. Moreover, the cocoons were of poor quality, with many double cocoons. No one rented the cocoon market, and there was no market for fresh cocoons. They were all baked using local methods. Some silkworm farmers took them to neighboring counties to sell, and the cocoon price was only 15 to 20 yuan.</p>

<p>The new tea in She County has been harvested and processed by mountain households early, and various stores have also opened their scales one after another to search for purchases. Initially, mountain households wanted to raise the asking price due to the poor tea production this year. However, the stores were constrained by tight credit and mostly bought less. Therefore, the market price was similar to the old one. Currently, various tea shops in Shen Du and Jie Yuan are rushing to be the first to offer new tea. The top-grade Zhenmei tea has mostly been selected and completed and is being packed and shipped one after another. Other grades are also being selected and roasted.</p>

<p>— Gu·Ming·Dao·</p>
<p>He Yahu was a bandit from beyond the pass. He had the strength of a tiger. He was skilled in marksmanship, and his shots always hit the target. He was also good at riding. He often held a white wax pole and sneaked out at midnight to steal horses, leaping away. Pursuers could not catch up with him. Because he was born mute, he was known as the Dumb Tiger. After the Japanese army easily obtained Liaoning Province, they wanted to fulfill their ambition to annex Manchuria and Mongolia. Therefore, they immediately sent a large army along the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line to attack Rehe. Chaoyang once fell into the hands of the Japanese army. How shameful was the policy of non-resistance! Therefore, volunteer armies rose up one after another, trying their best to prevent the Japanese army from entering Rehe, launching attacks from time to time, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. The Japanese army suffered greatly. He Yahu also raised his pole and led his troops to resist Japan. One day, the volunteer army and the Japanese army engaged in a fierce battle on the border of Rehe. The Japanese camp urgently dispatched a regiment to reinforce them. The border of Rehe was full of high mountains and deep valleys, winding and secluded. Those who were not familiar with the geography did not dare to enter easily. He Yahu learned that the Japanese army had reinforcements, so he led hundreds of his followers, ambushed in the mountain passes, and launched an attack at night. He rode a steed, carried two guns, shouted loudly to kill the invaders, and charged into the enemy army, as brave as a tiger. The Japanese army responded in a hurry, not knowing how many enemies there were, and collapsed in confusion. He Yahu's guns never missed, and he killed countless enemies. It was midnight, and the Japanese artillery could not exert its power, so they retreated in defeat. He Yahu commanded his brave men to pursue and kill them bravely. At dawn, he led his troops away, as fast as a whirlwind. Although the Japanese army suffered damage, there was nothing they could do. They knew that Rehe could not be easily bullied, so they withdrew their troops, fearing that they would be surrounded by the volunteer army, resulting in the annihilation of the entire army. Brave He Yahu, he can be compared to Xiao Bailong and Lao Beifeng!</p>
<h3 id="e154">The Bloodstains of May Thirtieth <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>

<p>No one would believe that in our own country, performing our patriotic deeds would be interfered with by foreigners; and if interference was not enough, they would arbitrarily arrest people, and if arrest was still not satisfactory, they would finally use force to massacre our compatriots, so that a page of shame would be added to our history. What is going on?</p>
<p>Alas! Thinking of the rehearsal of the tragedy, we can't help but curse the Japanese pirates. They have already invaded us through economic means, opening factories in Shanghai and recruiting our compatriots to work for them, extracting countless amounts of money from us without labor and transporting it to their island nation. There is no need to discuss this in detail. Who knew that they would become more and more fierce, treating our workers harshly in every possible way, and even unreasonably killing our compatriot Gu Zhenghong, and wanting to bury his corpse in the boiler. Fortunately, his family received the news and ran around appealing for help, and finally achieved victory. Zhenghong's remains were not turned into ashes. However, this tragic fact had already aroused public outrage across the country. In particular, local groups and schools successively organized teams to go out and publicize. However, the vicious Japanese dared to kill people and not allow them to speak. They colluded with the authorities in the concessions, acting in collusion, and strictly prohibited our propagandists from moaning in the concessions. On May 30 of the fourteenth year, they unreasonably arrested our compatriots who were speaking and listening, and massacred our people on Nanjing Road with rifle fire!</p>
<p>Alas! The so-called "May Thirtieth National Humiliation Day" was created within such a simple outline. As a result, the authorities did not have the ability to resolve the case satisfactorily, and every year today, they still suffer through it with a bitter face. This time, it is even more painful, and the humiliation is even greater. The Japanese pirates invaded Shanghai with large-scale atrocities. Fortunately, the 19th Route Army fought bravely, and the Japanese pirates could not achieve what they wanted. It is pitiful that our little people have always followed the government and suffered humiliation, but in the end, they are only disappointed.</p>
<p>Today, commemorating May 30th, thinking of the bloodstains of that year, and everything that is arranged before our eyes, we feel even more pain!</p>

<p>丨Miscellaneous Writings of the Old Capital, No. 7丨</p>
<p>It was the season when pomegranate flowers illuminated the eyes. After eating a zongzi to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, E and I rushed to the Five Dragon Pavilions in Beihai in a puff of smoke. It was because there was a yacht race in Beihai today. According to ancient custom, there should be a dragon boat race on the Dragon Boat Festival, but it has not been possible in recent years. However, I don't know which gentleman thought of using a yacht to replace the dragon boat. The yacht race was considered a dragon boat race. This is almost using a new form to express ancient customs. This is a very exciting thing.</p>
<p>When I walked to the Five Dragon Pavilions, the banks were already tightly packed with people. In the water, there were also countless yachts lined up. The number was written on the stern of the boat. Some boats had a red flag erected on them with the word "Commander" written on them. There were two men and a woman sitting on the boat. They all had healthy physiques. The man held a megaphone and a notebook, and the woman held a triangular flag. After the commander's boat moved around in the water for a while, the yachts preparing for the race were all arranged in a certain place. Each boat had strong arms gripping the oars, waiting for the command to be issued to muster their strength to win the championship. After waiting for a while, the commander's boat gave a preliminary command, and then a sharp whistle was blown, and the triangular flag was waved. More than a dozen yachts all slid into the green waves covered with lotus and water chestnuts as if flying. The ones lagging behind struggled to move forward, and the ones in front worked hard not to fall behind. In this way, the yachts gradually moved away, eventually resembling a group of black ducks floating on the water. However, the audience on the shore still opened their mouths wide and watched intently.</p>
<p>About twenty minutes later, yacht number three reached the finish line first. The yachtsman was a student from Guangdong. For a moment, many people from Guangdong on the shore lifted him high and took a photo. Many of the boats that arrived later lowered their oars dejectedly. Only the red yacht that came in last was still swaying in the middle of the journey when all the other boats had reached the finish line. However, the yachtsman did not lose heart because of this. He was still working hard as if there were still boats behind him that were about to catch up. He did not relax the movement of his oars. As a result, he finally reached the finish line in the midst of people's ridicule. No one welcomed him or picked him up to take a photo. However, he jumped up and down happily for a while before putting on his clothes. Yes, with his spirit, he will be able to win the championship in the near future.</p>

<p>How magnificent is Ma Zhanshan! The second Qi Jiguang. Qi displayed his power in the south, and you defended firmly in the north.</p>
<p>How magnificent is Ma Zhanshan! He always fought to be the first to kill the enemy. Everyone else did not resist, but you alone fought with them.</p>
<p>How magnificent is Ma Zhanshan! Even the powerful enemy was amazed. There were two million soldiers being trained, but only he could defend himself.</p>
<p>How magnificent is Ma Zhanshan! His loyalty and bravery are well-known and respected. Silk and embroidery are used to cast his image in gold, and the people will never forget him.</p>
<p>How magnificent is Ma Zhanshan! Exhausted, he retreated to Hailun. Almost all of the three provinces fell, but one corner was preserved by him.</p>
<p>How magnificent is Ma Zhanshan! He severely denounced the traitors. Many people came to persuade him to surrender, but who dared to beard the tiger's whiskers?</p>
<p>How magnificent is Ma Zhanshan! His ambition never wavered despite setbacks. Victory and defeat are common occurrences. Move forward and do not hesitate.</p>
<p>How magnificent is Ma Zhanshan! He endured the hardships of the battlefield. Even with only one soldier left, he fought to the death to defend the territory.</p>
<p>How magnificent is Ma Zhanshan! His isolated army hung in the remote fortress. The iron army planned to rush to his aid, but the road was long and they did not arrive in time.</p>
<p>How magnificent is Ma Zhanshan! He cleverly deceived the Japanese invaders. He endured humiliation and served the puppet court, without revealing his true colors.</p>
<p>How magnificent is Ma Zhanshan! He revived the banner of the three armies. He found out the secrets and telegraphed the news to the outside world.</p>
<p>How magnificent is Ma Zhanshan! He always held hatred in his heart. He will raise the volunteer army and recover Heilongjiang.</p>

<p>Two Blind Female Poets: In the Royal Normal School in London, there are two female students, one named Margaret Brand and the other named Joan Hewlett. Both are Welsh, both are seventeen years old, and both are blind. The two go in and out together, travel and rest together, and study together. But secretly, they compete fiercely in their studies, neither willing to give way to the other. In their hearts, they both regard each other as formidable enemies. Recently, in the British National Academy, a global English literary competition was held. The first and second prize winners in the poetry category were these two blind female poets. Margaret won first place. Her poem is called "A Dream". Joan won second place. Her poem is called "What I See". After the announcement, it was widely recited for a time. Now both are at Oxford University, still studying diligently, trying to get the most honorable degree. These two girls are truly blind in their eyes but not blind in their hearts.</p>

<p>— Mo·Yi·</p>
<p>This is a letter sent from Moscow. The person who wrote the letter seems to be a Russian. He truthfully told us about the recent life in Russia, but he wrote this letter with a dissatisfied attitude, so the words are full of painful tone. The full text was published in the Shanghai French newspaper on the 15th. Translator's Notes</p>
<p>Although I am sending you this letter describing life in Russia, I am not sure if it will reach you. Because the secret communication method here has been completely exposed like all other secrets. This letter will of course have to pass through the eyes of the inspector, so I dare not imagine whether it will be detained or not.</p>
<p>I belong to the second category of workers. The supplies I receive each month can be exchanged for one kilogram of sugar, five hundred grams of pure wheat or noodles, three hundred grams of meat; in a few days I will get two hundred and fifty grams of soap; every day I get four hundred grams of black bread, which contains about 50% beans and sweet potatoes. Because Moscow is the political center of Russia, and many foreigners live there, civil servants and children can get white bread.</p>
<p>Everything else that needs to be used must be purchased from state-owned stores, but its price is absolutely disproportionate to our income. On average, our monthly salary ranges from fifty to two hundred rubles, up to three hundred rubles, but you must hold a second job. And the market price of various items is as follows: butter costs 25 to 30 rubles per kilogram; milk costs 3 rubles per liter; eggs cost 7 rubles per ten; beef costs 6 to 8 rubles per kilogram; pork costs 15 rubles per kilogram; ham, cooked meat, fruits and vegetables cannot be bought. Lemons were sold for four rubles each a few months ago; household soap costs two to eight rubles per bar. Clothes, except for factory personnel who are licensed to receive them, everyone else must go to the second-hand clothing market to buy them themselves at amazing prices. For example, silk scarves cost 50 to 100 rubles each, and other items can be seen from this.</p>
<p>From this, you can imagine the various aspects of our life with a monthly income of 150 to 200 rubles. Shoes in particular make us feel pain. The government sells as many shoes as possible to foreign countries, but the country often lacks shoes, and people even have no shoes to wear. If foreigners return the goods we sell because they are of poor quality, we would be extremely happy. Although we have to buy a pair of shoes for 170 rubles, we will not have to worry about being barefoot.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Ye's residence, they still went straight to the Fifth Madam's main room. The Fifth Madam personally received them in the small reception room outside the bedroom, which was for her personal use. When she saw An Yutian, she cordially called him her brother-in-law. She also praised Liang Xiaoyun for her brother-in-law's character. An Yutian stole a glance at the Fifth Madam. At this time, she was probably only halfway through her makeup. Although her face was covered with a very thick layer of white powder, the delicate work of drawing eyebrows and applying lipstick was not yet complete. There were also two small peach-shaped rouge colors missing on her cheeks. Reflected by the electric lights, she was white with a hint of green, and green with a hint of white, looking like Sima Yi on the stage, making people shiver all over. He couldn't help but quickly lower his head, and was also troubled by the restraint of responding. Fortunately, the Fifth Madam was also busy with her makeup. After a while, she dragged Liang Xiaoyun into the room, ordering only Mao Deshun to stay here to entertain An Yutian. An Yutian then felt that Mao Deshun was easier to talk to. After killing about two more hours, this group finally appeared on the second floor of the grand theater. The Fifth Madam walked in the front with a graceful manner. Her heavy makeup and luxurious clothes, with treasures and pearls, had become the most exquisite work of art for everyone to focus on. Liang Xiaoyun followed closely behind. Her graceful appearance was worthy of admiration, and she was even more charming. But for some reason, once she was under the shoulder of the Fifth Madam, her aura would always be inferior to her, and she couldn't be so flamboyant and active. Further behind was An Yutian, who looked shy and walked awkwardly, and Mao Deshun, who was dressed in military uniform and military boots, showing off his status. They walked to the third box on the east side. The Fifth Madam and Liang Xiaoyun held hands and went to the front row of seats, sitting side by side. Although there were still two empty chairs next to them, the Fifth Madam also pretended to let An Yutian sit there. But Liang Xiaoyun hurriedly winked. An Yutian immediately knew that it was not appropriate to be so casual and unrestrained, which would hinder people from watching. He politely declined a few times and kept backing away. He could only sit high in the second row of seats in the box and join Mao Deputy Officer, looking like an attendant guarding a noble lady. Fortunately, he was not here to watch the show, but to meet important figures. He might as well bear it for a while and wait for Mao Deshun to act.</p>

<p>— Fo</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Peiping yesterday, Puyi secretly telegraphed a certain former Qing noble in Peiping to find twenty-six eunuchs and secretly send them to Changchun. Yesterday, twenty-one returned to Peiping, and Puyi himself funded the retention of the remaining five.</p>
<p>The system of imperial eunuchs was originally the only evil example of the autocratic era. Puyi is called the executive but is not called the pseudo-emperor. Penal eunuchs are not applicable.</p>
<p>Moreover, Manchuria is a country of young masters, and all economic income and expenditure are controlled by the old masters. Puyi did not obtain permission from the backstage boss and arbitrarily recruited eunuchs. Puyi's "ignorance" can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Things come together by category, and people seek each other with similar inclinations. Puyi and the eunuchs are different in name, but the same in fact. To give an example, one cannot help but laugh.</p>
<p>Eunuchs are called males, but they actually have no genitals. Puyi is called the executive, but he actually has no power. That is the same one. Eunuchs are Puyi's slaves, and Puyi is the Japanese's slaves. That is the same two.</p>
<p>Eunuchs are hired, and Puyi is also hired. This can be seen from the fact that he funded the retention of five. That is the same three.</p>
<p>Puyi is still unaware of being fooled by the Japanese and goes to touch this hornet's nest again. Zheng Xiaoxu was "ignorant" and was slapped in the face. Zheng Chui was "ignorant" and was hit with a Japanese gun handle. Puyi, you should be "knowledgeable"!</p>

<p>— Wei Shen</p>
<p>Snow cream has the function of moisturizing the skin, it is smooth but not greasy, fragrant but not vulgar, so people love to use it; but there are many Western goods on the market, and the price is quite high. The production of domestic goods has made great progress in recent years, which is enough to restore the right to profit. Today, I tried to make it in the school, and the results are not bad, so I dare to record it for the readers to try.</p>
<p>Raw materials and quantities:</p>
<p>Stearine: 10 grams (Io grams)</p>
<p>Sodium Carbonate: 1 gram Igram)</p>
<p>Glycerine: 2 cubic centimeters (2 CCH)</p>
<p>Hazel Water: 10 cubic centimeters (IOCC)</p>
<p>Distilled Water: 100 (ooCC)</p>
<p>Rose Musk Oil (Western name unknown): A small amount of the above items can be purchased from chemical industry raw material companies.</p>
<p>Utensils:</p>
<p>A large evaporating dish, a pair of chopsticks, an alcohol lamp and an iron frame and iron mesh, and a balance and measuring cup.</p>
<p>Method: First, grind ten grams of stearin into a fine powder, and measure one hundred cubic centimeters of distilled water, pour it into the evaporating dish, then dissolve one gram of sodium carbonate in it, heat it on the alcohol lamp, and after it is completely dissolved, add the ground stearin powder slightly, stirring it with chopsticks in one hand. If white foam is about to overflow, you can temporarily remove the lamp: but you must quickly put it back, and you must continue to stir it at this time, and do not stop for a moment. After adding all the stearin, continue to stir until it presents a milky white semi-liquid state, then you can take it away from the fire and wait for it to cool. When it is slightly cool, pour in ten cubic centimeters of hazel water, mix it evenly, and after cooling, add two cubic centimeters of glycerin and three or four drops of rose musk oil and mix it evenly. Snow cream is thus completed!</p>
<p>Note: Rose musk oil must first be dissolved in alcohol, (End)</p>

<p>— I</p>
<p>After nine years of complete silence from an old friend, to be able to accidentally meet him again on the road today is truly a cause for excessive joy for me. When I carefully recognized that it really was him, I hurriedly grasped his hand with all my enthusiasm. I said tremulously:</p>
<p>"Ah! It's really you! You... you've aged so much that I almost didn't recognize you. Do you still remember me?"</p>
<p>He didn't say a word for a long while; he just stared at me with a wild look in his eyes. After a long time, he weakly lowered his head, murmuring as if speaking to himself:</p>
<p>"Yes... ah! You're still alive too! Hmph! You've aged too; we've all aged."</p>
<p>"Isn't that right? We've all aged!"</p>
<p>From his conversation, I learned that he had long been serving in the XX Road Army and had even participated in the glorious Shanghai War this time. This made me sincerely admire him, because in comparison to him, I felt too insignificant. Wasn't I? What reason did I have not to be ashamed before this great warrior? But his exhausted spirit also worried me, so I couldn't help but ask him boldly:</p>
<p>"Friend! I see you're very pessimistic. Can you tell me why?"</p>
<p>"Pessimistic? Yes, I am very pessimistic! But what am I not pessimistic about? For example, this time I came to fight the imperialists with a belly full of anger, fully expecting to be able to lift the Chinese nation out of heavy oppression in this bloodshed. But what's the reality? Friend! What is the reality? Do you think we really lost? Fine! Let them say what they want. Ah! How can I not be pessimistic?"</p>
<p>I didn't have suitable words to answer him; I could only stare blankly at his face. Afterwards, he continued:</p>
<p>"Friend! You should know that our army is going to 'XX' again. Naturally, the authorities will have new declarations, new slogans, and naturally, the expedition will be justified, and they will naturally explain that 'this expedition has great significance'. But what is given to me? Only I know... Ah! What else can I say?"</p>
<p>His eyes were spitting fire, and extreme anger filled his chest. Finally, he said with a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"They want me to kill Chinese people again, kill Chinese people! But what will I do? What will I do?..."</p>
<p>After that, we finally parted. I felt particularly heavy-hearted. I sincerely wish him well in the future.</p>

<p>— Starving Brain</p>
<p>After finishing lunch, I walked out of the office and strolled along the several roads near the office, looking at the colorful and dazzling goods displayed in the shop windows to adjust my mood from the dull, mechanical life of being confined to the office and buried in paperwork.</p>
<p>I crossed Nanjing Road. The cars, rickshaws, and other vehicles on the road sped like the tide in the Huangpu River, rushing towards their homes to prepare for their lunch. On the cement sidewalks, people were also advancing in twos and threes with lengthened strides, each with an expression, a demeanor, as if telling people, "We're going to eat."</p>
<p>At the entrance of a lane, under the overhanging building, three or four young and strong beggars were waiting for an old steward from a catering business carrying a meal-burden to walk out of the lane. They wanted to wait for the old steward to pass by them so they could pour out some leftovers that people had eaten, filling their stomachs.</p>
<p>A beggar woman from Jiangbei, dressed in tattered clothes of the 19th-century style, with a pair of bound feet like water chestnuts, supporting the strength of her whole body, swayed like a hungry hawk pouncing on a rabbit from a branch lane of a main alley, closely following behind the meal-carrying steward, also hoping to pour the remaining cold rice and leftovers from the meal-burden into her hand-held lead bowl, mixing it into a kind of hundred-juice porridge or hundred-juice rice.</p>
<p>The beggars waiting under the overhanging building all dashed forward with great speed, their momentum fierce, displaying a kind of warlord's eating posture as if they were dividing up territory. In silent words, they hinted at a meaning, as if saying, "This is our begging territory, our sphere of influence. No other beggar is allowed to infringe upon it." As a result, the Jiangbei woman also acquiesced to them being the local beggar warlords and had no choice but to dejectedly walk backwards, allowing the beggar warlords to pour out the leftovers and gather around to feast, celebrating their victory. The old steward carrying the meal-burden stood still, waiting for them to finish their work of grabbing the leftovers, and then leisurely carried the empty burden out of the lane.</p>
<p>The patrolman managing the lane also seemed to have reached a compromise with the three or four young and strong beggars long ago, tacitly acknowledging their actions as legal and not interfering in the slightest.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I saw Mr. Qi Hua's article "The Barrister," which reminded me of the divorce cases of two of my friends, which are worth recounting.</p>
<p>The first friend, Mr. K's wife, Ms. S, wanted to divorce him because she was dissatisfied with Mr. K's treatment. But in reality, Mr. K's treatment of Ms. S was not bad; it was just that Mr. K's financial strength was weak, and he couldn't give her a carefree life of extravagance. So Ms. S went to Mr. X's law firm to discuss divorce matters.</p>
<p>"Because my husband has repeatedly abused me and is unable to provide for me, I'm asking your firm to handle the divorce proceedings," Ms. S said to Mr. X.</p>
<p>"Since that's the case, how much property does Mr. K have? What is his monthly salary?" Mr. X asked with a smile. Ms. S said, "I'm ashamed to say that he only has a monthly salary of over thirty dollars. As for property, it's even less worth mentioning!"</p>
<p>Mr. X frowned upon hearing this and revealed a very displeased expression, saying, "Ms. S! I think it's better not to divorce. Because the evidence is insufficient, and we lawyers can't tear apart a couple alive. If you can endure, please endure. Don't act rashly."</p>
<p>Ms. S lowered her head and couldn't answer a word.</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>The second friend, Mr. D, his wife, Ms. W, because she had an affair, listened to the encouragement of her lover and went to Mr. C's law firm, asking him to handle Mr. D's divorce. Mr. D originally loved Ms. W very much and never expected her to have such a change.</p>
<p>Ms. W said to Mr. C, "My husband has an affair, so I want to divorce him."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the words that Mr. C asked were the same as those of Mr. X earlier. Before he could finish listening, he asked Ms. W very anxiously:</p>
<p>"How much salary does Mr. D earn each month? Is he wealthy?"</p>
<p>"Him? His monthly salary is about five hundred dollars, and his assets..."</p>
<p>Before Ms. W could finish speaking, Mr. C touched the Charlie Chaplin-style mustache on his lip and laughed heartily, saying:</p>
<p>"Ms. W, please rest assured. Mr. D is so heartless and unjust that this lawyer will handle it according to the law!..."</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Ms. W returned with a smiling face!</p>
<p>Movies</p>
<p>— "Hatred of a Lost Nation"</p>
<p>Speaking of "Ben-Hur," I'm afraid there isn't a single friend who likes to watch movies who doesn't know it. Because this film, when silent films were popular, not only caused a sensation, but also every theater that screened this film tripled its profits. Of course, with a film like this, spending three years and four million US dollars in capital, plus 150,000 actors, I wonder how many films can spend such a large sum of money? But now there's even better news: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has turned this film into a sound copy and released it to the world. The English name is still "BRNHUR", but the Chinese name, I heard, was changed to "Hatred of a Lost Nation" due to the order of the Film Censorship Board. I heard that it will be premiered at the Cathay Theatre today. Shanghai movie fans, hearing this news, may jump for joy!</p>
<p>Two Major Programs Premiere in Nanjing The Whitety Smith band, praised throughout Shanghai and admired by Chinese and foreigners, will perform its music at the Nanjing Grand Theatre today. The music is superb and elegant, extraordinary, and their singing and dancing are as melodious as the oriole and as gracefully fluttering as the butterfly, truly something that people will never tire of hearing and seeing. At the same time, the passionate and well-known love film "Love Devil" (DerilLslery), starring "Yellow License" actress Elizabeth Landi and Maclaren, will also be screened. The plot is winding and the performance of Elizabeth Landi is delicate and appropriate, even better than before.</p>
