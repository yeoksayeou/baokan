<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>時評</p>
<h3>中國的出路何在　彬</h3>
<p>我們認爲此一問題。在目前已至爲簡單。亦至爲明顯。一言以蔽之。即我民族如欲求得光明之出路。惟有發動一次廣大的革命的自衛戰爭。</p>
<p>這次十九路軍的英勇抗禦日軍。已經給予我們一個當頭的敎訓。正如鹽澤所言。「這次戰事是中國所應受的敎訓。」這種敎訓的意義。即是我們惟有以齒還齒以目還目惟有發動大衆的力量。以答覆日本軍閥的暴力。并爭取我民族的生存自由。屈服即爲等死而乞援與求助。也爲卑怯可恥的行爲。</p>
<p>日本軍閥的代言人。曾說「中國陸軍在國防上爲無用。不過爲軍閥在國内政治競爭中之工具而已。」而自去年九一八以來。我國政治領袖所一再昭示人民的意旨。亦異口同聲的爲「我國積弱軍力太薄。不足以反抗日軍的暴力。惟有忍辱負重暫時屈服。」然而這次十九路軍的英勇抗爭。竟在國際人士驚奇的掌聲中一勝再勝。使日軍之野心與暴行。終無由得逞。這不僅是證明了惟有以革命的武力。才能答覆日本軍閥的暴行。而其最重要者尤爲指明了我們政治領袖的說話。都是一片謊言。甚或是别有用意。</p>
<p>不錯。在某種觀察上說。我們的軍備。當然不如日本軍力之雄厚。然而假使我們能發動廣大的羣衆。爲人民武力的後盾。與日軍作持久的苦戰。我爲保守。彼爲進攻。我理直彼理曲。誰能說强暴者不將陳尸於我們的足前。又誰說我們民族地位。不將從此提高呢。</p>
<p>當美國華盛頓爲爭取獨立而戰争的時候。在一七七八年的冬天。敗退福革河流域這種艱苦的情形。據有一個法國少年將軍辣斐德說。「不幸的兵士。沒有什麽東西沒有外套帽子與襯衣。也沒有鞋他們的足與腿都凍成黑的了。軍中常終日沒有吃的。」然而。在官長與兵士的堅忍。與僅剩下一個不死的爲公道的信心。美國的獨立終於成功了。又如蘇聯革命的初期。長爲别國所中傷與侵略。有一個時期蘇聯政府要抵禦十二條戰綫。自一九一四年起經過了六年戰爭。幾爲戰爭與革命所疲乏。又爲一九二一年可怕的瘟疫與旱荒。殺死了三百多萬人。然而在一種至高尚的堅忍信心。與艱苦奮鬥之下。蘇聯的地位。終於日益鞏固了。再如土耳其的復興。莫不經歷險惡的挫折與艱苦的鏖戰。只要我們能以必死的决心與堅忍的信心。作百折不撓的苦鬥。我們固何有於日本軍閥的侵略。又何有於當前的國難。</p>
<p>所以要打破當前的國難。惟有變不抵抗的武力。爲國家的武力民衆的武力。發動大衆的力量。奮起與日軍作肉搏之血戰。必如此始能轉變我民族的命運。也必如此。始能奮起我民族光明的前途。</p>
<p>上海事件</p>
<h3>日艦炮轟吳淞砲台敗退</h3>
<p>蕰藻浜二次偷渡亦失敗閘北我軍陣線昨晚進展靑雲路擊落敵飛機一架日軍二度總攻吳淞失敗後、靜待增援陸軍開到、再作大舉、昨日、吳淞閘北兩度戰况、故較和緩、惟日艦九艘、昨午一時起、在三夾水洋面、以重砲轟擊吳淞砲臺、我軍應戰甚力、四時始止、陸路方面、昨晨二時日軍數百、偷渡蕰藻浜、被我全部殲滅、上午九時敵復沿軍工路進攻、經我軍抄襲其後方、敵始潰退、閘北日間甚爲沉寂晚、七時後、敵大隊在獹烈砲火掩護下、由福生路衝攻我寳山路防線、激戰至八時五十分、敵不支敗退、我軍乘勝追擊、陣線進展至虬江路北四川路口、敵飛機、昨仍四出擲彈偵察、上午十一時、在靑雲橋被擊落一架、日機師二人均殞命、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<h3>蕰藻浜之戰况</h3>
<p>昨晨偷渡又吿失敗</p>
<p>下午偷襲亦經擊退</p>
<p>轟擊砲台亦無效果</p>
<p>吳淞方面日兵、昨仍在蕰藻浜、再試偷渡、結果又復失敗、繼由陸軍進攻、亦未得逞、午後因　　來進攻、日飛機續在吳淞砲台投擲炸、但均未中的、雙方砲轟、至下午四時漸平、我軍仍固守砲台在下午五時半左右、日兵由司令部方面派出空卡車九輛、經南京路往楊樹浦方面駛去、係載運援軍至滬江大學附近增援、因該處日兵佈置、已大致就緒、而一師陸軍、今日可到、恐大戰即將開始矣、茲將昨聞誌下、</p>
<h3>二次偷渡失敗</h3>
<p>駐淞記者、昨</p>
<p>日冒險繞道至楊行鎭、得晤吳淞公安七區一所長曾可光、據云昨晨黎明時、敵利用曉色蒼茫、竟復派兵數百名、在依周塘角南草菴前面、乘民船偷渡蕰藻浜、當被我軍發覺、隔河用機關槍掃射、敵兵不死於槍彈、即溺於水、無一生還、自昨晨起敵軍在黑橋南徐家灣等一帶、復不時向我軍進攻、雙方陣線、並無變化、吳淞全鎭房屋、十九已成焦土、寳山方面、尚稱寗靖、該處居民早已遷移一空、寳山縣政府公安局建設局册單局欵產處等各機關、業已遷至羅店鎭辦公、</p>
<h3>偷襲野戰亦敗</h3>
<p>昨日上午十</p>
<p>時許、日軍又由軍工路抽調一大部份陸軍、向蕰藻浜方面偷襲、利用重砲掩護、猛向我軍衝鋒、我軍亦藉砲臺大砲掩護、奮勇迎擊、雙方即在蕰藻浜車站南軍工路上野戰、我軍左右兩翼甚爲活動、從敵軍後方推進、敵軍恐受包圍、乃急向後敗退、同時敵軍正面亦被我軍擊散、我軍即在軍工路原陣地固守、此役日兵死傷二百餘人、</p>
<h3>轟擊砲臺無效</h3>
<p>昨日下午一</p>
<p>時起、敵艦九艘、在吳淞口向吾砲臺開砲轟擊、甚爲猛烈、吾軍亦發砲還擊、直至三時半左右、敵艦知吾有備、勢不得逞、砲聲乃息、吾方受損極微、又前日下午三時許、敵艦十餘艘、向岸上發砲攻擊、同時以機關槍十餘架助戰、均經吾軍還擊、至四時許、砲火始停、又前日傍晚、吾軍某團之搜索隊、在屈家橋遇敵數百、奮勇抵抗、敵不支遁去、又前日下午一時許、敵軍在天通庵附近、用猛烈砲火向吾軍攻擊、吾方亦還擊、至四時許、敵漸不支、砲聲亦停、</p>
<h3>日軍增調援軍</h3>
<p>昨日日兵司</p>
<p>令部、於下午五時半左右、派出空卡車九輛、經南京路直向楊樹浦方面駛去、聞係載運援軍、至軍工路滬江大學附近增援、以該處日兵防禦、佈置已將就緒、惟兵力甚薄、該空卡車上、每車有日陸戰隊二名押車、步槍緊靠車篷、兇相畢露、並悉原駐蕰藻浜車站以南之右翼敵海軍陸戰隊、及右翼軍工路敵軍陸戰隊第二中隊、以及正面、均改由新到之下元陸軍團擔任、左翼則尚未更調完畢、僅前衛由陸軍接替、聞日兵坦克車已運到、現正急於計劃、由蕰藻浜渡河、惟我軍機槍掃射猛烈、敵軍甚爲膽寒、頗有徒事犧牲之苦、</p>
<h3>日艦附近中彈</h3>
<p>字林報云、</p>
<p>據河泊司記錄、昨日九　黃浦江内日艦調動、未有遠出吳淞者、外傳昨日淸晨、上海附近日艦發砲轟擊閘北、但海關當道則謂未曾目擊、僅於黎明以前、見中國軍隊發出之二彈、落於日海軍司令旗艦附近浦江内、相距不過二三百呎、日旗艦泊在日郵船會社碼頭、此次砲彈料從閘北鄰近某地發出、按近十日來約共有砲彈八枚、落於日旗艦所泊處所</p>
<h3>前晨日機自墮</h3>
<p>大美晚報云</p>
<p>、據官塲消息、昨日（九日）上午九時三十分日軍有單座位追擊機一架、在楊樹浦新造飛機塲附近被迫降落、着地即傾覆、機身微損、駕駛員未受重傷、旋即送往日軍戰地醫院醫治、又據字林報云、該機大受損、駕駛員二人均受重傷、</p>
<h3>外報稱譽華兵</h3>
<p>字林報云、</p>
<p>昨晨（九日）日軍驅逐艦以極近距離猛放槍砲之際、突有中國兵士肩一機關槍、自斷垣躍出、馳過毫無屏蔽之一百五十碼、而重得一屏蔽地方、雖以機關槍之沉重、勢幾不勝負荷、而敵艦又僅在數百呎外、砲彈集其一、身密如雨下、該兵毫無畏懼、卒荷機關槍達其目的地、顯似未曾受傷、可謂神勇也已、</p>
<h3>馬隊助戰無據</h3>
<p>某方消息、</p>
<p>昨日某西報紀載、我軍以馬隊在吳淞方面助戰、衝進敵軍砲火陣綫、是項消息、恐係敵人故意散布謠言、蓋此種報吿、殊令人發噱也、</p>
<h3>閘北我軍進展</h3>
<p>靑雲橋擊落敵機一架</p>
<p>寳山路北昨晚又大火</p>
<p>昨日閘北方面、日間無劇烈戰事、晚七時大隊日軍、由福生路衝攻我軍寳山路防綫、一時砲聲隆隆、槍聲密集、激戰約一小時三十分、敵始敗退、我軍乘勝追擊、防綫進展至虬江路北四川路口、敵機五架、昨日上下午兩度至閘北轟炸、當被我軍在靑雲橋擊下一架、茲將各情、分誌於后、</p>
<p>昨晚劇烈戰事昨晚七時赴閘北方面、復有激烈戰事、砲聲隆隆、機關槍與步槍聲、密如連珠、至八時五十分始停戰、據本報記者調查所得、係大隊日軍在砲火掩護下、由福生路向寳山路我軍防綫進攻、我軍待其迫近、即以機關槍掃射、戰約一小時半、日軍死傷枕藉、始不支而退、我軍乘勝追擊、防綫進展至虬江路北四川路口、同時在寳山路以北至虬江路間一帶房屋、中彈焚燒、火光燭天、至十一時、始漸熄滅、</p>
<h3>敵機兩度轟炸</h3>
<p>昨晨八時、</p>
<p>有日機五架、飛來閘北天空、未一刻鐘、又由浦東方面飛來四架、環繞起落、盡情偵察我靑雲路及滬西沿鐵路防綫、可三刻鐘後、大部東去、留閘北祗兩機、旋該兩機由南市飛轉、即在閘北、開始擲彈、大半均落於江灣與八字橋方面、當飛機之來、沿寳山路一帶、即起砲聲與機槍聲我方亦還擊、至十時三十分、日機全去、於是砲聲槍聲、亦因之而停、故昨日全日如天通菴路·虬江路·寳興路·老靶子路·一帶、祗有斷續機槍聲、未有劇烈戰事、但至午後四時十分日、機五架、復來閘北、三高兩低、所投炸彈較晨尤猛、但大半落旱橋西北曠地、損害極微、</p>
<h3>師長區壽年參謀長李擴和合影（李子洋攝）</h3>
<h3>擊落敵機一架</h3>
<p>昨晨十時</p>
<p>敵機五架、在靑雲橋天空擲彈時、我空軍由楊隊長駕起大號戰鬥機一架、凌雲應戰、此時日機因仍在亂擲炸彈、故飛行甚低、我方飛機、乃飛高於日機之上、用機關槍向下掃射、交戰約二十分鐘、日機不支、向東疾駛圖遁、惟中有一架、業已受傷、當即下墮於靑雲橋南堍、時日機師二人、一已斃命、一則僅折斷一足、故猶握手槍向我軍射擊、作最後之掙扎、當經我軍還擊、將其擊斃、其餘四架、則均逃入租界、我機爲維護租界人民安寗起見、故未窮追、</p>
<h3>江灣略有戰事</h3>
<p>閘北方面戰</p>
<p>事中心、已由北四川路一帶移往虹口公園附近、戰事要區、大部份東起狄思威路、沿江灣路、經天通菴路、靑雲路、北達體育會路爲終點、敵軍大部份、集中於虹口公園、在虹口公園之西面轉角處、敵軍配有野戰砲數門、鐵甲車及騎兵等、亦多集中於此、昨日雙方除以遠距離之砲戰、及敵軍以飛機向我襲擊外、於上午九時許、在江灣路體育會路附近、略有戰事、據另一消息、在距離該路五百碼持志大學左側、及虹口公園西北角之露天游泳池後面、中日兩軍、發生戰事、日軍以鐵甲車兩輛、及士兵等數百名、激戰歷一小時、日軍不支而退、鐵甲汽車、於急馳圖逃時、因我方砲火猛烈、有一輛馳落壕溝中、前部損壞、車輛不能移動、乃爲我軍砲火所毁、并斃敵兵數十名、輕重傷者、亦不下數十人、</p>
<h3>我軍奪獲大砲</h3>
<p>自前夜日軍</p>
<p>施行總攻擊後、即以大砲向我陣地猛烈、轟擊一時、砲聲隆隆、即法租界亦淸澈可聞、惟經我軍沈着抵抗、並設奇計破敵、卒將日軍擊退、並奪獲大砲九尊、聞日軍自經此次巨創後、損失極大、</p>
<h3>發現敵方氣球</h3>
<p>昨日上午十一時後、敵方有氣球一只、高昇空際、估定其方位、距天通路車站匪遙、是蓋敵方利用氣球、遼望我軍陣線者、</p>

        <h1>1932.02.11</h1>
<h3>Where is China's Way Out? - Bin</h3>
<p>We believe that this question is now extremely simple and obvious. In a nutshell, if our nation wants to find a bright future, the only way is to launch a large-scale revolutionary war of self-defense.</p>
<p>The heroic resistance of the 19th Route Army against the Japanese army has already given us a head-on lesson. As Yizawa said, "This war is a lesson that China should receive." The significance of this lesson is that we can only answer the violence of Japanese warlords with an eye for an eye, and we can only mobilize the power of the masses to fight for the survival and freedom of our nation. Submission means waiting for death, and begging for help is a cowardly and shameful act.</p>
<p>The spokespersons of the Japanese warlords once said, "The Chinese army is useless in national defense, but only a tool for warlords in domestic political competition." Since the September 18th Incident last year, the will of our country's political leaders repeatedly declared to the people has also been unanimously "Our country is weak and its military strength is too weak to resist the violence of the Japanese army. We can only endure humiliation and submit temporarily." However, the heroic resistance of the 19th Route Army has won victory after victory in the astonished applause of international figures, preventing the ambitions and atrocities of the Japanese army from succeeding. This not only proves that only revolutionary force can answer the atrocities of the Japanese warlords, but more importantly, it also points out that the words of our political leaders are all lies, or even have ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Indeed, from a certain perspective, our military equipment is certainly not as strong as Japan's military strength. However, if we can mobilize the broad masses to be the backing of the people's armed forces and fight a long-term war of attrition with the Japanese army, we are conservative and they are aggressive, we are justified and they are wrong. Who can say that the violent will not be corpses before our feet? And who said that our national status will not be raised from now on?</p>
<p>When George Washington fought for independence in America, in the winter of 1778, the hardship of retreating to the Fox River basin was described by a young French general Lafayette: "The unfortunate soldiers had nothing, no coats, hats, or shirts, and no shoes. Their feet and legs were frozen black, and the army often had nothing to eat all day." However, with the perseverance of the officers and soldiers and the confidence in the only undying justice, American independence was finally achieved. Similarly, in the early days of the Soviet revolution, it was often slandered and invaded by other countries. At one time, the Soviet government had to defend twelve fronts. After six years of war since 1914, it was almost exhausted by war and revolution. In 1921, a terrible plague and famine killed more than three million people. However, under a supreme and noble tenacious faith and arduous struggle, the status of the Soviet Union has finally become increasingly consolidated. Furthermore, the revival of Turkey has experienced dangerous setbacks and arduous battles. As long as we can fight hard with a determination to die and a tenacious faith, what do we have to fear from the invasion of Japanese warlords, and what do we have to fear from the current national crisis?</p>
<p>Therefore, to break the current national crisis, we must transform the non-resistant armed forces into the national armed forces and the people's armed forces, mobilize the strength of the masses, and bravely engage in bloody hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. Only in this way can we change the fate of our nation, and only in this way can we arouse the bright future of our nation.</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Bombard the Wusong Fort and Retreat</h3>
<p>The second attempt to cross the Yunzaobang also failed. Our army's front line in Zhabei advanced last night. An enemy plane was shot down at Qingyun Road. After the Japanese army's second general attack on Wusong failed, it waited for the arrival of reinforcements from the army before making a major move. Yesterday, the war situation in Wusong and Zhabei was relatively relaxed. However, nine Japanese warships bombarded the Wusong Fort with heavy artillery on the Sanjia Water Sea from 1:00 PM yesterday. Our army fought back vigorously and did not stop until 4:00 PM. On the land side, hundreds of Japanese troops attempted to cross the Yunzaobang at 2:00 AM yesterday, but were completely wiped out by our army. At 9:00 AM, the enemy attacked along Jungong Road, but was ambushed by our army from behind and was forced to retreat. Zhabei was very quiet during the day. After 7:00 PM last night, a large enemy force, under the cover of fierce artillery fire, attacked our Baoshan Road defense line from Fusheng Road. After a fierce battle until 8:50 PM, the enemy was defeated and retreated. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the front line advanced to the intersection of Qiujiang Road and North Sichuan Road. Enemy planes still went out to drop bombs and reconnaissance yesterday. At 11:00 AM, one was shot down at Qingyun Bridge. Both Japanese pilots were killed. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>The Battle of Yunzaobang</h3>
<p>Another failed attempt to cross yesterday morning</p>
<p>The afternoon raid was also repelled</p>
<p>Bombing the fort was also ineffective</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers in Wusong were still trying to cross the Yunzaobang yesterday, but the result was another failure. Then the army attacked, but also failed. In the afternoon, because they were coming to attack, Japanese planes continued to drop bombs on the Wusong Fort, but none of them hit. The shelling between the two sides gradually subsided at 4:00 PM. Our army is still firmly defending the fort. At about 5:30 PM, the Japanese soldiers sent nine empty trucks from the headquarters and drove along Nanjing Road to Yangshupu to reinforce the Japanese soldiers near Shanghai University, because the deployment of Japanese soldiers there has been largely completed, and a division of the army can arrive today, fearing that a major war will begin. The news heard yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Second Failed Crossing</h3>
<p>Report from the resident reporter in Song, yesterday</p>
<p>At the risk of detouring to Yangxing Town, I met Zeng Keguang, the head of the first branch of the seventh district of the Wusong Public Security Bureau. According to him, at dawn yesterday, taking advantage of the dim light, the enemy actually sent hundreds of soldiers again, riding civilian ships in front of Yizhou Tangjiao South Caobian to cross the Yunzaobang. When they were discovered by our army, they were swept across the river with machine guns. The enemy soldiers either died from bullets or drowned in the water. None survived. Since yesterday morning, the enemy troops in the Heiqiao South Xujiawan and other areas have repeatedly attacked our army. There is no change in the front lines of both sides. Nineteen out of ten houses in the entire town of Wusong have been reduced to scorched earth. Baoshan is still relatively quiet. The residents there have long been evacuated. The Baoshan County Government, Public Security Bureau, Construction Bureau, Census Bureau, and Property Office have all moved to Luodian Town to work.</p>
<h3>The ambush and field battles also failed</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00</p>
<p>At that time, the Japanese army also drew a large part of the army from Jungong Road to ambush the Yunzaobang, using heavy artillery cover to fiercely charge our army. Our army also used the artillery of the fort as cover to bravely fight back. The two sides fought in the field on Jungong Road south of the Yunzaobang Station. The left and right wings of our army were very active, advancing from the rear of the enemy army. The enemy army was afraid of being surrounded and retreated hastily. At the same time, the front of the enemy army was also dispersed by our army. Our army immediately held the original position on Jungong Road. In this battle, more than 200 Japanese soldiers were killed or injured.</p>
<h3>Bombing the fort was ineffective</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00</p>
<p>Starting at that time, nine enemy warships opened fire on our fort in the Wusongkou and bombarded it fiercely. Our army also fired back. It was not until about 3:30 PM that the enemy warships realized that we were prepared and could not succeed, and the sound of artillery gradually ceased. Our side suffered very little damage. Also, at about 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, more than a dozen enemy warships fired on the shore, and more than a dozen machine guns helped in the battle. They were all countered by our army. The artillery fire stopped at about 4:00 PM. Also, the day before yesterday evening, a search team of a certain regiment of our army encountered hundreds of enemies in Qujiaqiao and resisted bravely. The enemy could not hold on and fled. Also, at about 1:00 PM the day before yesterday afternoon, the enemy army used fierce artillery fire to attack our army near Tiantong'an. Our side also fought back. At about 4:00 PM, the enemy gradually could not hold on, and the sound of artillery also stopped.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Increased Reinforcements</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese Soldiers' Headquarters</p>
<p>At about 5:30 PM, nine empty trucks were sent out, driving straight along Nanjing Road to Yangshupu. It was said that they were carrying reinforcements to reinforce the Japanese soldiers near Shanghai University on Jungong Road, because the defense deployment of the Japanese soldiers there was about to be completed, but the troops were very weak. On each of the empty trucks, there were two Japanese marines escorting the trucks, with rifles close to the truck's canopy, looking fierce. It was also learned that the right-wing enemy marines stationed south of the Yunzaobang Station, the second squadron of the right-wing Jungong Road enemy army, and the front, were all taken over by the newly arrived Xiayuan Army Regiment. Only the vanguard on the left wing has not been completely replaced, and only the vanguard has been taken over by the army. It is said that the Japanese soldiers' tanks have been transported in, and they are now in a hurry to plan to cross the river from Yunzaobang. However, our army's machine gun fire is fierce, and the enemy army is very frightened, and suffers a lot of unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Hit Nearby</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported,</p>
<p>According to the records of the River Conservancy, the movement of Japanese warships in the Huangpu River yesterday did not go far out to Wusong. It was rumored that Japanese warships near Shanghai fired on Zhabei early yesterday morning, but the customs authorities said that they had not witnessed it. Only two shells fired by the Chinese army before dawn fell near the flagship of the Japanese naval commander in the Huangpu River, only two or three hundred feet away. The Japanese flagship was docked at the pier of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company. It is believed that these shells were fired from somewhere near Zhabei. According to reports, about eight shells have fallen near the berth of the Japanese flagship in the past ten days.</p>
<h3>Japanese Plane Crashed by Itself the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported,</p>
<p>According to official sources, at 9:30 AM yesterday (9th), a single-seat pursuit plane of the Japanese army was forced to land near the new Shanghai Aircraft Factory in Yangshupu. It overturned upon landing, and the fuselage was slightly damaged. The pilot was not seriously injured and was immediately sent to the Japanese army field hospital for treatment. According to the North China Daily News, the plane was severely damaged, and both pilots were seriously injured.</p>
<h3>Foreign Newspapers Praise Chinese Soldiers</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported,</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (9th), when the Japanese destroyers were firing guns and artillery at extremely close range, a Chinese soldier suddenly jumped out of a broken wall with a machine gun on his shoulder, rushed across an unprotected one hundred and fifty yards, and regained a sheltered place. Although the weight of the machine gun almost overwhelmed him, and the enemy warships were only a few hundred feet away, and the shells were as dense as rain on him, the soldier was fearless and finally carried the machine gun to his destination, seemingly unharmed. He can be called a brave warrior.</p>
<h3>No Evidence of Cavalry Assisting in the Battle</h3>
<p>According to a certain source,</p>
<p>Yesterday, a certain Western newspaper reported that our army used cavalry to assist in the battle in Wusong, charging into the enemy's artillery fire. This news is probably a rumor deliberately spread by the enemy, because this kind of report is really laughable.</p>
<h3>Our Army's Progress in Zhabei</h3>
<p>An Enemy Plane Shot Down at Qingyun Bridge</p>
<p>Another Big Fire on North Baoshan Road Last Night</p>
<p>There were no fierce battles in Zhabei yesterday during the day. At 7:00 PM, a large Japanese force attacked our army's Baoshan Road defense line from Fusheng Road. For a time, artillery fire roared and gunshots were dense. After a fierce battle for about an hour and a half, the enemy was defeated and retreated. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the defense line advanced to the intersection of Qiujiang Road and North Sichuan Road. Five enemy planes bombed Zhabei twice yesterday morning and afternoon, and one was shot down by our army at Qingyun Bridge. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fierce Battles Last Night. At 7:00 PM, there were fierce battles in Zhabei again. Artillery fire roared, and machine gun and rifle fire were as dense as continuous beads. The fighting stopped at 8:50 PM. According to the investigation of this newspaper's reporter, it was a large Japanese force attacking our army's defense line on Baoshan Road from Fusheng Road under the cover of artillery fire. Our army waited for them to approach and immediately swept them with machine guns. After about an hour and a half of battle, Japanese soldiers were killed and wounded, and they could not hold on and retreated. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the defense line advanced to the intersection of Qiujiang Road and North Sichuan Road. At the same time, houses in the area north of Baoshan Road to Qiujiang Road were hit and burned, and the fire was bright. It gradually extinguished at 11:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bombed Twice</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM,</p>
<p>Five Japanese planes flew over Zhabei, and in less than a quarter of an hour, four more flew from Pudong, circling and rising and falling, fully scouting our Qingyun Road and the railway defense line along the western part of Shanghai. After three quarters of an hour, most of them went east, leaving only two planes in Zhabei. Then the two planes flew from Nanshi and immediately began to drop bombs in Zhabei, most of which fell in Jiangwan and Baziqiao. When the planes came, artillery and machine guns fired along Baoshan Road, and our side also fought back. At 10:30 AM, all the Japanese planes left, and the artillery and gunshots also stopped. Therefore, all day yesterday, only sporadic machine gun fire was heard in Tiantong'an Road, Qiujiang Road, Baoxing Road, and Laobazi Road, without fierce battles. However, at 4:10 PM in the afternoon, five Japanese planes came to Zhabei again, three high and two low, and the bombs dropped were even fiercer than in the morning, but most of them fell on the open space northwest of the Hanqiao, causing very little damage.</p>

<h3>An Enemy Plane Was Shot Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00</p>
<p>When five enemy planes were dropping bombs in the sky over Qingyun Bridge, our air force pilot, Yang, drove a large fighter plane and took off to fight back. At this time, the Japanese planes were still dropping bombs randomly, so they were flying very low. Our plane flew higher than the Japanese planes and swept down with machine guns. After about twenty minutes of fighting, the Japanese planes could not hold on and sped east, trying to escape. However, one of them had already been injured and immediately fell at the southern end of Qingyun Bridge. At that time, one of the two Japanese pilots was already dead, and the other only had a broken foot, so he still held a pistol and shot at our army, making a final struggle. He was shot and killed by our army in return. The other four planes all fled into the concession. In order to protect the safety of the people in the concession, our plane did not pursue them.</p>
<h3>Minor Battles in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>The center of the battle</p>
<p>in Zhabei has shifted from the North Sichuan Road area to the vicinity of Hongkou Park. The main battle area extends east from Dixiwei Road, along Jiangwan Road, through Tiantong'an Road, Qingyun Road, and north to the Sports Association Road as the endpoint. Most of the enemy troops are concentrated in Hongkou Park. At the west corner of Hongkou Park, the enemy troops are equipped with several field guns, armored vehicles, and cavalry, which are also concentrated here. Yesterday, in addition to long-range artillery battles and enemy planes attacking us, there were minor battles near the Jiangwan Road Sports Association Road at about 9:00 AM. According to another source, a battle broke out between the Chinese and Japanese troops 500 yards away from the left side of Chih Tze University and behind the open-air swimming pool in the northwest corner of Hongkou Park. The Japanese army fought fiercely with two armored vehicles and hundreds of soldiers for an hour. The Japanese army could not hold on and retreated. When the armored vehicle was rushing to escape, one of them fell into the trench due to the fierce artillery fire of our side. The front part was damaged, and the vehicle could not move, so it was destroyed by our army's artillery fire, and dozens of enemy soldiers were killed, and no less than dozens were lightly and seriously injured.</p>
<h3>Our Army Seized Cannons</h3>
<p>Since the night before last, the Japanese army</p>
<p>After carrying out a general attack, they used cannons to bombard our positions fiercely for a while, and the sound of artillery was loud, and even the French Concession could hear it clearly. However, after our army calmly resisted and devised ingenious plans to defeat the enemy, they finally repelled the Japanese army and seized nine cannons. It is said that the Japanese army suffered great losses after this major defeat.</p>
<h3>Enemy Balloon Discovered</h3>
<p>After 11:00 AM yesterday, an enemy balloon rose high into the sky. Estimating its position, it was not far from the Tiantong Road Station. This was probably the enemy using balloons to look at our army's front line.</p>
<h3>Our Country Has Never Abandoned Sovereignty Over the Concession's Airspace</h3>
<p>The City Government's Reply to the US Consul General</p>
<p>The City Government previously received a letter from US Consul General Cunningham, requesting that</p>
<p>The Chinese military authorities be notified to stop military aircraft from flying over the concession. The City Government immediately replied, stating that the sovereignty over the airspace within the concession is inherent to our country and has never been abandoned, so it cannot be interfered with by anyone. The exchange of letters is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Letter from the US Consul</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I recently received a letter from the Chairman of the Public Works Bureau on February 6, stating that Japanese military aircraft flying over the concession for reconnaissance, demonstration, and combat purposes endanger life and property within the concession and cause terror to residents. Now, a copy of the original letter is attached. My colleagues and I would like to support the opinion of the Chairman of the Public Works Bureau and convey it to my Japanese colleagues, advising them on the seriousness of military aircraft flying over the concession, and hoping that my Japanese colleagues will ask the Japanese army and navy authorities to stop this action, because this action often only has the possibility of endangering life and property within the concession. I, the Consul General, ask Your Mayor to convey the above opinion to the Chinese army and navy authorities, requesting that they stop military aircraft from flying over the concession. It would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<h3>City Government's Reply</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I recently received Your Consul General's letter of February 8, stating that Japanese military aircraft flying over the concession for reconnaissance, demonstration, and combat purposes endanger life and property within the concession, and will be conveyed to the Japanese army and navy authorities to stop this action. I also request that I convey to the Chinese army and navy authorities to stop military aircraft from flying over the concession.</p>
<p>It would be greatly appreciated, etc. Upon approval, I have found that the sovereignty over the airspace within the concession is inherent to our country and has never been abandoned, so our country's aircraft flying over the concession cannot be interfered with in any way. However, the Mayor is also deeply concerned about the safety of the lives and property of all the people in the city, and will naturally understand the opinion of the letter and convey it to the military authorities of our country for consideration. Moreover, it should be solemnly declared that if the concession authorities allow or do not prevent Japanese aircraft from continuing to fly over or pass through the concession, our troops, for the sake of self-defense, will not be responsible for all the consequences that occur when shooting at them. A corresponding letter is hereby sent for your reference.</p>
<h3>Concession Authorities Request Prohibition of Aircraft Flying</h3>
<p>The Strong Attitude of Japanese Officers</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Public Works Bureau, for the sake of military aircraft flying over the concession sky, endangering life and property within the boundary, sent a letter to the Consul General of the United States on the 6th of this month, requesting that he negotiate with the Japanese and Chinese authorities to prohibit it. The Consul General recently replied, saying that he has notified both China and Japan. The original letter is translated and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Consul General's Reply to the Chairman of the Public Works Bureau: "Dear Sir, I have received your letter of February 6, stating that Japanese military aircraft flying over the concession sky, whether for combat, reconnaissance, or exercise, are sufficient to cause panic among residents and endanger life and property within the boundary. I ask that this be conveyed to the Japanese authorities for prohibition, and that it also be conveyed to the Chinese authorities, asking that their aircraft not fly within the boundary, etc. All consuls express great sympathy for your bureau's views and have done as requested. I am sending you a copy of the drafts of the letters sent to the Japanese Consul General and the Mayor of Shanghai for your reference. Sincerely, General McNorriden, Chairman of the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession, from Cunningham, US Consul General, February 9, 1932"</p>
<h3>Letter from the Consul General to the Japanese Consul General</h3>
<p>"Dear</p>
<p>Sir, I have recently received a letter from the Chairman of the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession on February 6, stating that Japanese military aircraft flying over the concession sky, whether for combat, reconnaissance, or exercise, are sufficient to cause panic among residents and endanger life and property within the boundary. I ask that this be conveyed, etc. All consuls greatly agree with the Chairman's views, so I ask that you pay attention to the serious consequences that such flights may cause. All consuls hope that you will advise your country's army and navy authorities to stop these flights, so as to avoid the danger of endangering life and property within the concession at any time. This matter has also been notified to the Chinese authorities, asking them not to fly military aircraft over the concession sky. Sincerely, Mr. Murai, Japanese Consul General, from Cunningham, US Consul General, February 9, 1932"</p>
<p>The Consul General also sent a similar letter to Mr. Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that although the Public Works Bureau and the Consular Corps have repeatedly protested against Japanese aircraft flying over the concession, and the Japanese side has also promised not to fly over the concession again, yesterday (9th), several Japanese aircraft with the Rising Sun emblem directly flew over the commercial area of the concession. This flight of Japanese aircraft elicited countless shells from the Chinese army. Because they flew over the concession sky, the shells often fell in the Public Concession and the French Concession. There have been repeated reports of explosions injuring people, and the residents' property has suffered huge losses. However, last night, the two concession authorities failed to propose a remedy for the failure of Japanese aircraft to abide by the Japanese official's promise and still flew over the concession. When reporters asked whether the Public Works Bureau or the Consular Corps would raise another protest in the future, a certain bureaucrat replied that protests have been made many times, and the Japanese have agreed. He did not know what other methods could be adopted to ensure that the residents within the boundary would not be in danger of being accidentally bombed by Japanese bombers, or the entire plane falling, or eliciting Chinese artillery fire. Later, when the reporter asked a Japanese official, he got two answers. First, he said that it may be necessary to fly over the concession for protection. Then, he said, what right does China have to fire so many shells at Japanese aircraft?</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Continued to Drop Bombs Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 5:00 PM yesterday, in the area of Yuezhou Road, Yangshupu Road, in eastern Shanghai, a Japanese aircraft approached the area and, seeing a crowd of pedestrians gathered in the middle of the road, dropped a bomb that fell at the corner of Yuezhou Road and Zhoushan Road. A Jiangbei child, Wu Guangde, 14 years old, was injured on the spot, with injuries to his hands, feet, and abdomen. When the bomb exploded on the ground, it also affected the entrance of No. 261, Zhongnong, Junanli, and a door was blown off. An old woman from Pudong, Chen Wang, 54 years old, was also injured in both legs. The woman was later taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment by car. The child, Wu Guangde, was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injuries were too serious, and there may be a danger to his life.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (10th) at about 9:00 AM in western Shanghai, three Japanese aircraft soared in the sky along the area of Caogadu, Jisifeier Road, on the south bank of the Suzhou River in western Shanghai. They flew very high, only circling twice, and then sped towards Zhabei. It is reported that several bombs were dropped again near the north of Xiaoshadubang and Zhongshan Road: (1) One bomb was dropped north of the Fuxin Factory, north of Xiaoshadubang, injuring a person named Zhao Xiaosizi, 27 years old, from Jiangbei, who injured his leg; (2) A hole was blown up in the open space at Tanjiadu near Zhongshan Road, about three feet deep and the diameter of a round table.</p>
<h3>The Abominable Cruelty of Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>A Large Bomb Dropped on a Refugee Camp</p>
<p>Over Ten Thousand Refugees Dead, Injured, or Fled</p>

Now we have learned that a bomb from a Japanese plane fell on the Shanghai Refugee Camp on the border of Zhabei. Over ten thousand pitiful refugees were subjected to a great calamity, fleeing in terror or dying in horror, a scene too tragic to describe. The following is a detailed report on the aftermath of the bombing:</p>
<p>General Zhu (Ziqiao): Greetings. Since the Japanese army and navy attacked Shanghai, we have visited the flooded area refugee camps on the Zhabei border every day since January 30th.

<h3>Japan Sends Another Division as Reinforcements</h3>
<p>Reportedly Arriving in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate General Issues Bold Statement</p>
<p>Since the start of the war, the Japanese have been fiercely attacking Zhabei and Wusong for more than ten days. Their army, navy, and air force have been unable to make any headway. It is now reported that the Japanese government has decided to send another division of fresh troops to Shanghai to fight a major battle with our main forces. These reinforcements have been requisitioned by the Japanese authorities from Japanese merchant ships and escorted by more than ten destroyers from the 2nd, 26th, 15th, and 30th fleets stationed in Shanghai. The reason for using destroyers for transport is that they can travel at a speed of 33 nautical miles per hour. It is said that the division will arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese warships that entered the port included a 19th torpedo boat at 12:40 PM, a 26th torpedo boat at 3:20 PM, and two 2nd fleet ships at 4:00 and 5:30 PM. Those that left the port included the 30th fleet and one ship from the 2nd fleet, all sailing out in the afternoon.</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, at least six Japanese warships and transport ships arrived in the Huangpu River overnight, adding to the 33 ships already docked there.</p>
<p>According to the Continental Times, on the 9th, a spokesperson for the Japanese Consulate General claimed that Japan would not initiate peace negotiations until the Chinese army was driven out of Shanghai or voluntarily retreated beyond the range of their cannons. After the Chinese army leaves, we will seek an appropriate authority to open negotiations. In order to drive away the Chinese army in Shanghai, Japan is now sending another army division to help in the battle. Of the 33 Japanese warships stationed in Shanghai, 16 sailed out of the Songkou on Sunday to escort 10,000 new soldiers to Shanghai, expected to arrive around Thursday.</p>

<h3>French and American Warships Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Over a Thousand Vietnamese Soldiers Arrive</p>
<p>Forty-One Foreign Warships Remain in Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, various countries have been competing to send troops to Shanghai to protect their nationals. British and American troops have already arrived. France has also dispatched a large detachment of infantry stationed in Vietnam, transported by the cruiser Waldeck Rousseau from Haiphong. The ship arrived in the Huangpu River at 3:20 PM yesterday. When the ship arrived, it anchored in the Huangpu River off the French Bund, carrying over a thousand infantrymen and a large quantity of ammunition. The French Consulate in Shanghai, together with the French naval authorities, arranged for over thirty large trucks to transport them ashore at the French concession postal ship wharf, under the command of General Basque, to join the French concession defense zone.</p>
<h3>American Warships</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Times, yesterday (the 9th), the American destroyer squadron supply ship Black Hawk, which arrived in Shanghai from Manila, carried 69,000 tons of war supplies needed by the 31st Infantry Battalion. The American patrol gunboats Sacramento and Asheville, and the aircraft carrier Langley, are also on their way to Shanghai. It is reported that the decision to send these three ships to Shanghai was made six weeks ago and is not related to the Sino-Japanese war.</p>
<h3>Foreign Warships</h3>
<p>Excluding the seven Japanese torpedo boats, four gunboats, two transport ships, and one aircraft carrier, totaling fourteen, the largest number of foreign warships in the Huangpu River belong to the United States. As of yesterday, the American warships in the Huangpu River included the battleship Houston, the transport ships Black Hawk and Ashmount, five gunboats, and ten destroyers: 213, 215, 216, 217, 218, 225, 226, 228, 229, and 230.</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>In total, there are eighteen ships. In addition, there are two Italian ships, three French ships, and four British ships. Within the Huangpu River, there are a total of forty-one warships from five countries: Britain, Japan, America, France, and Italy. The Japanese warships currently transporting troops to the Orient are not included in this number.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Disregards Foreign Powers</h3>
<p>Not Hesitating to Provoke International Displeasure</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Dare to Secretly Attack British Warships. According to the North China Daily News, the British warship Berwick, which had been anchored off Songkou to observe the war for several days, was secretly attacked by a Japanese destroyer last night (the 9th). However, the British warship suffered only minor damage, losing its anchor and cable. It is claimed that the Japanese warship was damaged after the collision.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attempt to Destroy American Stores</h3>
<p>Great America</p>
<p>According to the Evening Post, the Pacific Products Company at 86 Jessfield Road reported that a Japanese plane flew around the store at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 9th), opening fire with its machine guns. The Russian workers in the store fled in panic, fortunately without any casualties. However, the glass greenhouse behind the store, in a neighboring residence, had many broken windows. At the time, an American flag was hanging on the flagpole on the side of the street. It is unknown why the Japanese plane had no regard for this.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Interfere with Western Police Duties</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, at 10:20 AM yesterday, a patrol led by a Western police officer near the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Haining Road, intervened in a relatively minor incident involving pedestrians, performing their duties. Japanese sailors used the butts of their rifles to obstruct them. Less than half an hour later, when the patrol was inspecting pedestrians entering the concession at the iron gate on Bazilu Road, they were again interfered with by Japanese sailors. Furthermore, plainclothes Japanese men brandished iron rods at the patrol. Also, according to a report from an Indian police officer, he personally witnessed a plainclothes Japanese man deliberately smashing the large glass windows of four shops on Broadway Road. It is also reported that the Japanese marines occupying the building at 9 Wusong Road demolished the walls and interior decorations to suit their convenience.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Hire Chinese Laborers to Transport Military Supplies for the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Refused by Chinese Laborers</p>
<p>In addition to a portion supplied by Chinese traitors, the Japanese army needs trucks, barges, and other items for transportation. It is now learned that the Japanese have bribed a foreign trading company in this port with a large sum of money to lease more than a dozen of the largest trucks and twenty or more iron barges to transport soldiers and ammunition to and from Wusong and Yangshupu. Yesterday, the foreigner hired 300 Chinese barge workers at a daily wage of five yuan to transport soldiers, but they were completely rejected by the Chinese workers. They also offered a large sum of money to hire dozens of drivers to transport them to and from Songhu, but they were also refused by our drivers. Later, the foreign company hired White Russians as barge sailors and drivers. Yesterday, the first trip of each vehicle to Wusong was detained by our army, three trucks were detained, and the rest were still being transported. Yesterday, all the American staff of the company warned that the foreigner was so greedy for money, undermined neutrality, and aided the evildoers, and filed a collective resignation.</p>
<h3>Our Army Protects Foreigners in the Line of Fire</h3>
<p>Highly Praised by Foreigners</p>
<p>Tongji University Professor Thanks for the Care. A Berlin dispatch from the National News Agency on the 8th: The situation of the German teachers at Tongji University in Wusong is a matter of great concern here. Today, we received a telegram from Shanghai, stating that the 13 teachers and their families who remained at the school have safely arrived in Shanghai, which is a great relief. They were treated favorably by the Chinese military authorities, and the women and children were transported by Red Cross ambulances, while the men walked, detouring through Zhenru to Shanghai. They carried only the necessities of daily life. All the valuable books and scientific specimens collected throughout their lives were left in Wusong. Today, all the newspapers are carrying accounts of what they witnessed. Although they were initially unwilling to leave the school, they all spent the night in the cellar on Sunday, and were finally forced to leave because Japanese planes were dropping bombs. The school's electrical laboratory was destroyed by a bomb, and many other buildings were hit by machine-gun fire. In their accounts, they all praised the bravery and skill of the Chinese soldiers, and the officers' kindness towards them.</p>
<h3>Indian Church Thanks for Protection</h3>
<p>Yesterday,</p>
<p>The secretary of the Indian Church on Baoxing Road, Hazula Zut, sent a letter to this newspaper thanking the Chinese volunteer army for protecting the church, stating: "At this time of war and turmoil, our church and the resident priests were in a life-or-death situation. Fortunately, the Chinese National Government's volunteer army recognized that all the people in the church were British citizens and immediately protected them, ensuring their safety. I would like to express my sincere gratitude on behalf of the Indian community. I would like to ask your newspaper to convey this."</p>
<h3>Three Million People in Shanghai Protest to the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Must Maintain a Neutral Stance</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Cannot Land or Retreat into the Concession</p>
<p>Since the brutal Japanese invasion of Shanghai, the Japanese have repeatedly used the Public Concession as a refuge, but the Municipal Council has failed to express a firm stance of neutrality. The three million people of Shanghai are extremely indignant. For days, representatives of various public organizations have been sending letters to the Shanghai Federation of Patriotic Organizations, requesting the federation to represent all the people and lodge a protest with the Municipal Council. The federation held a representative conference the day before yesterday and unanimously resolved to uphold the spirit of popular self-determination. Eighty-one organizations of the federation will represent the three million people of Shanghai and directly lodge a protest with the Municipal Council as a final warning. If the Municipal Council does not accept it, it will take other measures to save itself. The original text reads: "Dear Sirs, the Shanghai Municipal Council is an organization jointly formed by residents of various countries. If a national of one of the member states takes actions that disrupt the peace and order of the Municipal Council, the Municipal Council should exercise its authority, either morally or forcefully, to correct such disorderly and disruptive behavior. It cannot shirk its responsibility, nor can it stand idly by. This time, the brutal Japanese are using the Public Concession as a base for their army, launching attacks on the Chinese side from the Concession every day. After their defeats, they still flee into the Concession, preventing the Chinese army from freely eliminating violence. The order of the city cannot be restored, and the losses of Chinese and foreign residents are of course immeasurable. The organization and order of the Municipal Council are also fundamentally destroyed. The harm suffered directly and indirectly by the three million residents of Shanghai is even greater. Therefore, the representatives of more than 80 organizations of this association, representing the three million residents of Shanghai, hereby lodge the following final protest with you: (1) The troops stationed in the Public Concession should be limited to neutral countries, and their attitude should only be to protect the security within the Concession, not to launch attacks outside the Concession. All Japanese soldiers engaged in military operations should be expelled immediately. (2) In the future, Japanese soldiers coming to China must not be allowed to land in the Concession in the Yangshupu area again, and they must not retreat into the Concession after their defeats. We hope that the above two items will be implemented immediately, and please reply as soon as possible. Sincerely, the representatives of the Shanghai Federation of Patriotic Organizations, representing the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the General Labor Union, the Joint Education Association of Universities, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, the Lawyers' Association, the National Salvation Association, the Shanghai Local Maintenance Association, the Students' Union, the Constitutional Promotion Association, the Civil Governance Association, the Women's Great Alliance, and more than 80 other organizations, and the three million residents of Shanghai. February 10th."</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Destroys Commerce</h3>
<p>Real Estate Association Writes to the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Please Choose One of Two Paths</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association wrote to the Municipal Council yesterday: "Dear Sirs, Japan has blatantly violated international conventions and disregarded the commerce of friendly nations. Since September 18th of last year, it has invaded our three northeastern provinces, ignoring the advice and protests of friendly nations. It regards our country's efforts to maintain peace, respect friendly mediation, and make concessions for the sake of the overall situation as cowardice. Therefore, on the evening of January 28th of this year, after the Japanese Consul General considered satisfactory the four unreasonable demands that the Japanese army could not unconditionally recognize as an independent country for the mayor of Shanghai, it launched a major attack, and used aircraft to bomb civilians, hospitals, cultural institutions, and all buildings, and committed various inhumane acts in the Hongkou area, such as killing, torturing, looting, and kidnapping. The prosperous areas within our Concession have become deserted. The losses of our real estate industry due to the lack of appropriate protection are incalculable. Tracing back to the cause, the Japanese army is the ringleader and should bear full responsibility. However, your bureau and the consuls concerned are also difficult to escape the responsibility of failing to foresee the situation and make deep considerations in advance. Japan's invasion of China is actually its predetermined plan, and its central idea is to exclude all countries and dominate the Far Eastern market. Therefore, its coveting of Zhabei is an unavoidable fact. However, your bureau allowed it to defend the Hongkou area, which it used as a base for plotting against our country's garrison. As for the sanctity of neutrality, the Japanese army does not value it. The Japanese soldiers only possess advanced military weapons, and their culture is no different from that of barbarians, like a knife on a bull's horn. Now, the commerce of all countries and Shanghai is being destroyed by the Japanese army, and there is a continuous and even greater trend of destruction. If effective sanctions are not imposed immediately, the purchasing power of the Yangtze River area of China, and even the whole country, will be completely destroyed. Then, what other ways will European and American countries have to sell their goods? The position of your bureau will also inevitably decline. Our association is heartbroken to witness this. We love peace, just like your bureau and people of all countries. Therefore, we especially request your bureau, the defense forces of all countries, and the authorities to adopt the following measures: (1) Immediately disarm all Japanese soldiers in the Concession and seal up all their stored military supplies. Because the Japanese army is no longer protecting, but destroying the security of the Public Concession, just like the police officers of your bureau, if they do not maintain order but destroy it, they should be immediately dismissed and punished. (2) Prohibit Japanese people and consuls from engaging in military actions in the Concession. (3) Absolutely prohibit and prevent Japanese troops from landing at the docks in the Concession to stop their barbaric acts of expanding destruction of peace. If they insist on landing, they should be disarmed. Your bureau and people of all friendly nations only have the following two paths to take in the future: (1) Jointly maintain peace in the Far East and continue to seek the development of Chinese and foreign commerce, so that the prosperity of Shanghai will be sustained. Or (2) The purchasing power of China will be completely lost, making the markets of all countries in China desolate, and destroying the prosperity of Shanghai created by the efforts of tens of millions of people over eighty or ninety years. Your bureau and people of all friendly nations should consider this. As for our country, if Japan does not change its policy of force, it will never coexist under the same sky with the warlords of Japan. We hereby send this letter and hope that you will investigate and handle it accordingly. Sincerely, to the Director-General of the Public Concession Municipal Council."</p>
<h3>Neutrality of the Concession</h3>
<p>The Japanese Authorities Still Say It Does Not Hinder the Duties of the Police</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Mackinnon, wrote to the leading consul, Mr. Cunningham, on the 3rd of this month regarding the actions of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces, stating that he supported the protest lodged with the Japanese authorities by the Defense Committee. He has now received a reply from Mr. Cunningham stating: "I have received your letter of February 3rd regarding the reply received from the Japanese Consul General on the 7th. I am providing a copy for your reference. According to the letter, the Japanese Naval Commander in Shanghai has no intention of hindering the duties of the Municipal Council Police and hopes that the police and the navy will be able to cooperate more effectively when the situation improves. Sincerely, Cunningham, Leading Consul, February 9th." The Japanese Consul General's reply states: "I have received your letter of the 4th of this month regarding the issue of order and security in the Public Concession. I have forwarded the original letter to the Japanese Naval Commander stationed in Shanghai. I am now authorized by the Commander to state that he has no intention of hindering the duties of the police in the Concession and is very willing to cooperate with them and do his best to maintain order and security in the Public Concession. It is regrettable that there has been a lack of contact between the police and the navy in the past, but this may have been unavoidable in times of emergency. However, after the situation improves, there will be closer cooperation between us. I am transmitting this information to you for your information. Sincerely, Murai Kei, Japanese Consul General, February 7th."</p>

The letter states: "Respectfully, after investigation, the member schools of this federation previously transferred the national salvation funds raised to your bureau for storage. Now, as the Japanese invaders are attacking Shanghai, there is an urgent need to use the national salvation funds. This federation is dispatching Mr. Zhuang Zhiyuan of the administrative division to negotiate and request that your bureau return all the national salvation funds transferred by the schools to be taken back by the bearer. Thank you."</p>

<h3>Rescue Work in Full Swing</h3>

Mrs. Taylor, a member of the British Women's Association, comes to the meeting for several hours each day from Pudong to work. Other members also come from far away, demonstrating their enthusiasm. According to a Western member, we should do our best to take care of the soldiers injured in defending Shanghai to show our admiration for those who sacrificed for the country. Ladies who wish to express their sympathy and donate funds can send them to Mrs. Li at 497 Jing'an Temple Road.</p>

The head of the group has negotiated with the Japanese consulate through the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession to allow the Public Works Bureau to send personnel to the Japanese-occupied territory, together with the subgroup, to investigate all property evidence lost or not retrieved by the Chinese due to the war. Those who need to be investigated can register at the group's office in the Renji Shantang on Yunnan Road.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Social Affairs Repatriates Flood Victims</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has recently been assisting the Shanghai War Zone Refugees Temporary Relief Association in handling refugee accommodation. Currently, over 350 of the previous flood victims have been repatriated, departing from the rice industry wharf to Jiaxing in five small boats. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, over 600 people were repatriated, departing from North Suzhou River to Suzhou in nine boats. The expenses were all borne by the local Chamber of Commerce. Also, yesterday afternoon at approximately 4:00, several small boats from Wuxi arrived and docked at Beixinjing Town. The bureau has negotiated with the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession to allow them to sail to the North Suzhou River so that the remaining flood victims can be repatriated to Wuxi as soon as possible for temporary stay.</p>
<h3>Wang Bin'yan Organizes Battlefield Fire Brigade</h3>
<p>This time, the Japanese army has invaded our Shanghai territory, attacked Zhabei, and carried out destruction using artillery and aircraft. The shells and bombs they fired are extremely flammable. Therefore, wherever a bomb lands, a fire immediately starts, and the entire area is almost reduced to ashes. The original Zhabei Fire Brigade had four divisions: the first division was located on Nanxinmin Road near the railway, the second division was located on Huaxing Road, the third division was located on Qiujiang Road near the Songhu Railway, and the fourth division was located on Baoxing Road. Currently, only the second and fourth divisions are located on the front lines of the war zone. During the previous heavy fires, they bravely provided rescue. However, the pumping vehicles and hoses of each division suffered significant damage under intense artillery fire and rain of bullets. The third division has been burned down by the Japanese army. The second and fourth divisions are unable to drive out. Only the first division can still provide rescue as normal, but the hoses have suffered much damage. Furthermore, most of the service personnel and drivers have fled due to the intense artillery fire and have been unable to gather together. In response to the daily fires, Wang Bin'yan, the head of the Shanghai North District Security Corps and the chairman of the Firefighting Union, personally led security corps members and firefighters to the scene to put out the fires. The work is very dangerous and difficult, and this type of firefighting duty requires technical expertise and cannot be guaranteed by ordinary people. Recently, Mr. Wang Bin'yan received a handwritten order from Brigade Commander of the 120th Brigade of the 60th Division of the 19th Route Army, instructing him to intensify the work. Mr. Wang immediately summoned the firefighters currently remaining in Zhabei, reorganized them, and organized the Zhabei Battlefield Temporary Fire Brigade, appointing Mr. Wang Baoyu as the captain, and joining with Gu Xiqi, the director of the first firefighting division, to organize and add small workers, drivers, etc., to take shifts and work hard to provide services. Mr. Wang has negotiated with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to purchase ten gauze leather hoses for backup. He has also submitted a request to the municipal government to expedite the provision of rubber hoses and firefighting equipment, as most of the tap water pipes and fire hydrants in Zhabei have been damaged, and water must be drawn from afar. The pumping vehicles for extracting water from the Suzhou Creek are also being repaired. It is hoped that firefighters serving within the concessions can embrace a spirit of sacrifice and voluntarily participate in the Zhabei firefighting efforts to assist in the rear of the military and fulfill their national duty.</p>

Mr. Wang Yiting, Xi Weisun, Weng Yinchu, and Chen Rongzhang have been in charge, taking great pains and often staying in the hospital with chief physicians Shi Haixiong, Gu Bai, and Yu Zhuochu to supervise the progress.

The cash donations received will be reported in total to promote benevolence.</p>
<h3>Red Cross City Branch Rescue Work</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning (9th), the burial team of the Shanghai City Branch of the Chinese Red Cross, located on Guangqi Road, set off in three vehicles in cooperation with the charity group, heading towards Zhenru. They spotted a refugee with a bullet wound in his right foot, crying out in pain. They helped the person into the vehicle and sent them to the hospital in Shanghai. They then went to Jinan University, where they found one refugee from Wusong and one soldier from Hunan named Wu Fengde, both fatally wounded and lying on the ground. The team carefully coffined them and temporarily placed them in the charity group's public burial ground. Since the outbreak of the disaster, the group has allocated over 100 sets of plaster coffins to the Pushan Villa. It is said that the group is currently rushing to make high-quality clothes and coffins for the fallen soldiers. At 6 PM, Wang Songtang and Wang Yunlai, residents of the French Concession, were shot in the head while passing through the Sixteenth P铺, with blood flowing freely and serious injuries. They sought treatment from the Shanghai City Branch, where physicians performed surgery to sew up the wounds, applied medicine, and bandaged them before they left. It is unknown whether they will be alright.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Guildhall Accommodates Compatriot Refugees</h3>
<p>On the 8th of this month, the Jiangxi Public Association received a letter from Jiangxi Public Association Director Li Liejun and others, requesting the Jiangxi Guildhall to accommodate victims from Gan籍 in the war zone. After receiving the letter, the Jiangxi Public Association immediately notified the disaster-stricken victims in the war zone to go to the guildhall to register for lodging. The notice is recorded below: "Notice. Since the Japanese pirates have invaded our city, bombed Zhabei, and massacred our merchants and civilians, Shanghai, a safe place, has become a terrifying area, and a prosperous area has become a dangerous place. Our Gan compatriots are in the war zone and have been burned, looted, displaced, and homeless by the Japanese army. The colleagues of this guildhall, seeing this, will use the remaining houses in the guildhall as a place to accommodate refugees in the war zone and will take out the existing funds as much as possible to provide food for the refugee compatriots. All those who have no place to live should go to this guildhall outside Xiaonanmen to register as needed. This is a special notice. Shanghai Jiangxi Guildhall, February 8th."</p>

<h3>Japanese Warships Shell Wusong for a Week</h3>
<p>From the 3rd to the 8th</p>
<p>Chinese Property Lost</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Achieved Nothing</p>
<p>Starting at 11:20 AM on the 3rd, sounds of war were heard as Japanese troops began shelling Wusong. Three Japanese warships sailed out of the Huangpu River and began firing at the forts. Upon the second shot, our troops, in self-defense, returned fire. The battle ensued for a while, with cannons booming and bullets flying. Residents of Wusong panicked and fled westward, supporting the old and leading the young, their cries shaking the wilderness. After thirty minutes of combat, a Japanese transport ship was sunk by our troops on the spot, and two destroyers were damaged and fled out of the river mouth. Before the battle, a Japanese plane dropped bombs in the countryside of Santinggou River, but they did not explode. At noon, six more Japanese planes, divided into two groups, arrived at Wusong and dropped bombs on the fort area, which exploded immediately. At three o'clock in the afternoon, eleven more Japanese planes, divided into four groups, soared over the Wusong town and fort area, dropping bombs and firing machine guns downwards, destroying a corner of a civilian house in Zhanghuabang. Two of the planes were shot down by our anti-aircraft guns, and the remaining nine left at dusk.</p>
<p>At 11:20 AM on the 4th, six more Japanese warships sailed from Shanghai to Wusong. When they reached the fort area, the last destroyer of the thirtieth squadron opened fire on Wusong with machine guns. Our troops returned fire, and the forts also fired back. The attack and defense were quite fierce at that time, with the sound of cannons booming incessantly and bullets whizzing through the air, causing great fear. The furthest bullet landed near the Tangwan residential river, more than four li west of Yanghang Town, but did not explode. The strangest thing was that a large cannon shell weighing about seventy pounds fell on the house of Chen Yingtang in the west market of Yanghang, penetrated the wall into the kitchen, rushed through the corner of the stove, and soared upward through the ceiling and handrail, falling on the bed without exploding. A four- or five-year-old child was lying on the bed, unharmed. Another bullet landed on the main beam of the house of a foreman in Chengang Lane, destroying all three new houses. The seventh district office of the Wusong Public Security Bureau was under attack by three Japanese warships that had already sailed out of the river mouth, and three destroyers of the thirtieth squadron that were exchanging fire with the forts. The battle was fierce for more than an hour. Because the three ships were damaged, they could not leave the river mouth and had to flee south. When they sailed near Wusong Town, the reporter personally saw them fire two shots at the shore, one destroying Jiang Quantai's iron anchor shop and the other destroying the seventh district police station, injuring eleven policemen. As a result, the entire station chief and police temporarily retreated to a certain place. The three Japanese warships sailed to the Huangpu River in front of the Wusong Water and Electricity Plant and anchored. At 2 PM, they started again and fired along the way, destroying the Wantai rice shop and Li Bingsheng's firewood shop on the outer road, as well as Qiaomaofu's mill, etc., more than ten houses in total, all destroyed by artillery fire. The loss in Wusong was more than one hundred thousand taels of gold.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th, more than ten Japanese planes suddenly appeared in the fort area and the Wusong town sky, dropping bombs or firing machine guns, bombing downwards. Those destroyed included Tongji University, Yong'an New Factory, Shengtai Rice Shop east of Yunzaobang Bridge, Yin Da tobacco paper sundries store, and more than ten other places. In the afternoon, two more Japanese warships attempted to sail out of the river mouth and fire, destroying the residence of the Xu family tax reporting firm and the Xianyuan Book Teahouse. That night, some residents living in Wusong Town set fire in the rice wine shop opened by A Bao, a woman who made rice wine in Zhongxin Road, Dongzhen, hoping to loot. The fire spread and became uncontrollable. Although fire trucks from various districts arrived, most of the members had fled, so there were very few who arrived, and there was a lack of river water, so they had to let it burn. Therefore, those burned included the Wanchunshun North-South Goods and Tea Food Store, Xu Xinmaoxie Feng two fruit stores, Xintai Chang tobacco paper store, Wanmao clothing store, Zhonghe Hotel, and Xixiangfeng foreign goods store, Xu Wang two tin work stores, Maohua barber shop, a certain denture shop, Gongzhengtai fresh meat shop, and extended to Cuihualou restaurant on Songxing Road Street, Wang Shentai salted goods store, Zhenglong tobacco paper store, and eastward to Shi Hengxing tea food store, Yansheng money shop Liang Shunxin clothing store. The south side of the street was burned to Dafeng foreign goods store, a total of more than thirty houses were burned, and hundreds of buildings, the essence of Wusong Town, were all lost in that area. On the 6th, more than ten planes came again and dropped bombs and fired machine guns everywhere, causing the houses of the eighth district and third sub-bureau on Xi'an Road to be bombed, and then more than ten flat houses were burned, turning into a scorched earth. In addition, the building of Lu Genrong, a resident of Xi'an Road, and the building of Shan Genquan, a resident of Sanyi Road, and the house of foreman Zhou Ashun in the east section of Ju'an Road, were all bombed. In the evening, when the houses on the west side of Tongtai Road in the central market of Wusong Town were bombed, a fire broke out, extending to Changchun Street in the west. In total, thirty or forty households were burned, with about one hundred houses, also turning into a scorched earth. The tragic situation is indescribable.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 7th, four more Japanese warships exited the port and fired on the forts, and two ships were damaged. One ship docked at the mouth of the Yunzaobang River in Wusong, and the other docked at the Zhanghuabang grain and rice stack wharf. As a result, about a hundred Japanese marines were able to land there and launched a fierce attack northwards from the south bank of Yunzaobang along Jungong Road. After being bravely repelled by our infantry and machine gun company stationed there, the new and old bridges of Yunzaobang were burned to prevent the enemy from attacking. The Japanese invaders were unable to attack Wusong and scattered westward, opening fire and massacring villagers in the countryside around Zhoujiaqiao and Xugang Lane. On the 7th and 8th, those killed by gunfire in that area included Zhang Yin, a neighbor of the timber merchants, and his younger brother Lao Mao. According to eyewitnesses, Lao Mao was still able to speak after being shot, but was kicked into the river by the Japanese invaders and died. The cruelty of their methods is rarely seen among humans. Others killed by gunfire included Wu Er of Gouchi House, Lu Rongsheng of Dongzhaojiabang, Zhang Zhanglin of Xiaozhai, and Ting Mao of Hujia Bridge. There were also three Chongming people who encountered Japanese invaders in that area and were unable to escape in time. They were captured by these people and ordered to be guides. Because the three Chongming people were unwilling to guide, they were shot and killed by these people. There were also many who were killed whose names are unknown. There were also more than a dozen people who escaped after being shot in the hands or feet, including the son of the deceased Zhang Laomao. Therefore, the men, women, old and young in the area west of Zhanghuabang, Haoqiao, Zhoujiaqiao, Xugang Lane, and Zhaojiabang, seeing this tragic situation, supported the old and led the young, desperately fleeing westward, clogging the road. Therefore, cries shook the wilderness, and the misery was unbearable to hear. The villages east of the Sitang River have become a no-man's land.</p>
<p>On the 8th, four Japanese warships planned to exit the Wusong port, constantly firing from Wusong, causing countless houses in Wusong Town to be destroyed by artillery fire. Therefore, the residents of Wusong all fled westward. It happened to be snowing on that day, and the roads were slippery and difficult to walk. The refugees were covered in mud, slipping and kicking, all becoming mud people. The misery of the situation is difficult to describe in detail. At this moment, the residents of Wusong Town have completely fled outside the territory, and only the garrison remains. On that day, Japanese planes soared in the sky in groups, firing machine guns or dropping bombs and sulfur bombs. A sulfur bomb was dropped on Tongtai East Road in the central market of Songxing Road Street, causing Liang Sheng rice shop, Gu Taiyuan foreign goods store, Hengtai New clothing store, Huang Wan fruit store, Xieyuan fruit salted goods fresh meat shop, Tongxing wine shop, Dongwansheng sauce garden, and the eighth district party headquarters, more than ten houses in total, about twenty or thirty buildings, to be burned. In addition, Dong Shunxing's dowry shop at the north entrance of Tongtai Lane was hit by a sulfur bomb, and the house was destroyed and the shop owner Tong Er was killed in the store. After 2 PM, Japanese warships fired more than ten shots again.</p>
<h3>Central Government Sends Telegram to Comfort Armed Comrades</h3>
<p>The Central Executive Committee telegraphed from Luoyang to Mayor Wu on the 8th, forwarding it to all armed comrades defending Shanghai, saying that the violent Japanese troops had invaded and occupied the three northeastern provinces. It is appreciated that our government has vowed not to sign humiliating conditions and has threatened Shanghai with gunboats and marines. Fortunately, our garrison troops and reinforcements have fought bravely, and their loyalty shines brightly. In the past ten days, victories have been reported repeatedly on land, in the air, and in various fortress areas. The enemy has suffered heavy losses, and not an inch of land has been lost. Our soldiers are making legitimate defense for the country and maintaining peace for the world, which is worthy of admiration by the whole country and the world. The central government is deeply concerned about the hard work of the officers and soldiers and sends a telegram of comfort.</p>
<p>The National Government telegraphed, urgent to Committee Member Chen, Commander-in-Chief Jiang Zhenru, Army Commander Cai Tingkai, and Garrison Commander Dai Ji, and forwarded it to all officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army and the anti-Japanese divisions and brigades in Shanghai. The telegrams forwarded by Committee Member Chen from Commander-in-Chief Jiang and others have been received. The Commander-in-Chief's defense against insults is unparalleled in loyalty and courage, and his deep love for the country is especially commendable. It is hoped that he will maintain his sincerity and be more vigilant, so that he can establish extraordinary achievements and relieve the national crisis as soon as possible. Seal of the National Government.</p>
<h3>Aviation Administration Extends Condolences to the Huang Yuquan Brothers</h3>
<p>Huang Bingheng, Director of the Aviation Administration, telegraphed Huang Yupei, Captain of the 6th Aviation Team, yesterday, urgently to Shen Dexie, Director of the Aviation Factory, forwarding to Captain Huang Yupei. The brothers of the Captain have been deeply relied upon for their loyalty and courage in serving the country. This time, in supporting Shanghai, the Captain bravely took the lead, defeated the many with the few, and achieved meritorious service, which is especially commendable. However, Comrade Yuquan's ambition was not fulfilled, and he died heroically. The loss of such a talented person to the country is deeply regretted. In addition to having previously telegraphed Director Shen to give him a grand funeral, the ministry has now been requested to grant him a special pension. I am also deeply concerned about Comrade Daxian's injuries and hope for condolences on his behalf. Huang Bingheng.</p>
<h3>Suggestion for Chinese Landlords and Tenants to Donate to Military Expenses</h3>
<p>Attention to those living south of the Suzhou River</p>
<p>Landlords donate one month's rent, tenants donate half a month's rent</p>
<p>Donate money to help the military, save the country and protect the family</p>
<p>Well-fed soldiers will defeat the enemy decisively</p>
<p>Wang Yixian and others from the Conscience National Salvation Corps sent a letter to this newspaper, saying, "Respectfully informing you that since the violent Japanese troops provoked the conflict in Shanghai, our Chinese compatriots living in Zhabei and Hongkou have either fled as refugees or have been arbitrarily killed by Japanese guns, cannons, and bombs, which is like the difference between heaven and hell compared to those living in the British and French concessions south of the Suzhou River. However, if not for the brave resistance and repeated victories of our fighting soldiers, the dangerous situation would be unpredictable. At this time, all of our Chinese people should realize that property is something external to the body. At this critical moment of life and death, although we cannot join the army and directly defend against the enemy, we should do our best to assist indirectly, which can encourage morale and achieve a permanent resistance and the final victory. You have read Minister He Yingqin's telegram to the important figures in Shanghai, and you should know that the exhaustion of military expenses is a major problem. Donating money to help the military and save the country is to protect oneself and one's family. We humbly suggest that those in power from all walks of life initiate a proposal to the Chinese landlords and tenants in the British and French concessions south of the Suzhou River to donate to military expenses. For example, landlords donate one month's rent, and tenants donate another half month's rent. All rent donations will be used entirely for military expenses to defend against the enemy in Shanghai. As for how to do it, detailed regulations should be formulated separately and implemented accordingly. If we can assist with military expenses and avoid shortages, then well-fed soldiers will defeat the enemy decisively and be more courageous, so that the brutal Japanese troops will not be able to continue their rampage and affect relatively safe areas. Landlords and tenants living in the above-mentioned areas should have a clear understanding of the tragic situation in Zhabei and Hongkou and should not be stingy. Therefore, we submit these opinions and request that they be published in the newspaper so that we can arouse the attention of all sectors of society and proceed as soon as possible to benefit the military situation. The Conscience National Salvation Corps, Wang Yixian, Wang Shouchang, Zhang Xing'an, Xie Hongzhang, Zhang Chengsan, Zhou Xueliang, Pin Yunzhang, and 376 others.</p>
<h3>Comfort is Even More Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>Women Donate Military Clothing to All Newspapers and Compatriots from All Walks of Life: Recently, foreign insults have been rampant. Since our armed comrades have sacrificed for the country, our women compatriots, although unable to carry arms to defend against insults, should also abide by the principle that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country. They should automatically save money on food and clothing, abolish entertainment, makeup, and other expenses, and raise funds as much as they can to prepare military supplies to meet urgent needs. Recently, people from all walks of life who have enthusiastically donated have emerged like a rising wind and clouds, which is admirable. However, they are often not suitable for the needs and inevitably waste money. In view of this, we have initiated the Women's Donation of Military Clothing Association to meet the current need for spring snow and sudden cold. We plan to donate and produce 5,000 to 10,000 collarless cotton vests with patriotic cloth in the shortest possible time. Each vest is about two feet long and weighs eight ounces of cotton, using straps instead of buttons, and will be made within 36 hours. However, there are few people and the time is difficult, and the heart is more than enough but the strength is not enough. We respectfully request that all female compatriots carry one or two pieces, or dozens or hundreds of pieces, whether gray or black, new or old, and make simple ones. If everyone contributes, it will be easy to gather together. May our armed comrades who save the country and defend the people be able to resist the cold immediately and increase their courage to kill the enemy. We hope that all our sisters and sisters will ascend to compatriots and do their best to support and solicit donations as soon as possible, the more the better, or donate money to make them on behalf of others. Please submit everything to Mrs. Wang Junkuan and Mrs. Gu Yuirui of No. 573 Jia, Yiyanli, Baike Road, who will collect them on behalf of others. They will immediately make temporary receipts. Every time they collect enough or make 500 pieces, they will send them to the Shanghai All-Groups National Salvation Federation for collection and transfer to the Ling Department, and the items collected by the Association will be published in the newspaper. If there is any remaining capacity, they will continue to donate and make other application clothes to show their meager efforts. I hope that you will understand, Huang Wang Jisi, Jiang Yan Boying, Lin Zhang Jing, Xiang Niu Ruixue, Xu Renyi, Gu Wang Min, Wang Ding 圮, etc. of the Women's Donation of Military Clothing Association.</p>
<h3>Pan Yeqing Suggests Knitting Woolen Neck Warmers</h3>
<p>Ms. Pan Yeqing advised female compatriots to comfort the soldiers at the front with simple cold-proof items, saying that woolen neck warmers, four and a half inches high, can be put on the neck, and their cold-proof ability is strong, which can resist scarves, and is economical and simple. At this time of spring cold, the cold wind is blowing, and our loyal and brave soldiers are fighting against the enemy day and night, which is respectable and pitiful. National affairs and national disasters require everyone to share the responsibility. If our female compatriots do not assume the responsibility of front-line rescue, they should also do their duty in the rear. At present, the generals and soldiers fighting at the front need cold-proof clothing. Most of the women in Shanghai can knit wool. If each person spends a small silver coin of five or six pieces and one day, they can knit two or three of these woolen neck warmers. If they can work hard to knit, they can make thousands of them in one or two days, and comfort the generals and soldiers at the front with these woolen neck warmers, which can avoid the cold in the cold wind in the open air.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Yang and Others Use Silk Cotton Vests to Comfort the Army</h3>
<p>Mrs. Yang Xiaotian, wife of the Central Committee member, joined hands with Mrs. Du Yuesheng, Mrs. Zhang Xiaolin, and Miss Huang from the Shanghai community yesterday to take the initiative to raise funds to rush to make cold-proof vests. They raised more than 6,000 yuan in one day, including 1,000 yuan from Du Sunqin, 1,000 yuan from Du Chen Guoying, 500 yuan from Yang Chenhua, 200 yuan from Du Shen Wenqin, 200 yuan from Zhang Fu Yuehua, 100 yuan from Du Ge Yi, 50 yuan from Ge Shen Wei, 20 yuan from Yang Yin Rongjun, 20 yuan from Mrs. Li, 20 yuan from Zhu Xingyin, 10 yuan from Ge Ma Xiuqing, 10 yuan from Ge Pan, 1,000 yuan from Du Yao Guxiang, 500 yuan from Ye Yang Yuzhen, 200 yuan from Gu 𦲉ping, 100 yuan from Gao Lihua, 200 yuan from Lu Cuiguan, 200 yuan from Zheng Jinyunying, 50 yuan from Wu Li Qiwen, 50 yuan from Lu Chen Xuejun, 500 yuan from Jin Zhang Baolin, 100 yuan from Tao Hua Wangfang, and 10 yuan from Li Qiong. The above cash can make more than 1,500 silk cotton vests. In addition, Huang Li Zhiqing and others have already raised 1,850 military blankets. After the vests are finished, they will be sent to the front line to comfort the army together.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Kong Xiangxi Donates Another 2,000 Cotton Quilts to Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Mrs. Song Ailing, wife of Mr. Kong Xiangxi, a member of the Central Committee, previously raised 1,000 sets of cotton clothing and trousers to distribute to the 19th Route Army Office for replacement, because the wounded soldiers had been fighting hard for many days and their clothes were dirty, which she feared were unsuitable for their sick bodies. Now, Mrs. Kong has heard that the weather has been cold recently, and has raised another 2,000 cotton quilts to distribute to the wounded soldiers for use. They are currently being processed and rushed to make them. In order to complete them as soon as possible, Mrs. Kong and her children are personally sewing them. Last night alone, they had hand-made 50 quilts.</p>
<h3>City Women's Relief Association Extends Condolences to Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Relief Association has been working hard on rescue, publicity, and condolence work since the Shanghai Incident. Yesterday, they brought dried milk, oranges, and other items to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road to comfort the wounded soldiers, one serving for each person. The directors Lin Kecong and Jin Shiyin personally distributed leaflets praising the soldiers and encouraging the people, with words of comfort added. It is said that the wounded soldiers were all grateful and wept.</p>
