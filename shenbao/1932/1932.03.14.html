<p>時評</p>
<h3>敬告國聯調查團翰</h3>
<p>國聯調查團。將於今日抵滬矣。團中人跋涉重洋。長途僕。僕蓋負國聯所付託之重要使命而來也。</p>
<p>自九一八禍變以來。日本侵略之範圍愈益擴大形勢亦愈嚴重。憶一月二十一日白里安曾通告行政院諸委員。謂「調查團開始工作時之狀態。巳與决議案日所期望者迴異。」詎料遷延至今。形勢更非昔比。日本侵佔東北未巳。更繼以東南禍變。今日調查團抵滬。目覩吳淞一帶。片片皆瓦爍塲。瘡痍滿目。試與歐戰中比知利時之悲哀相映照。不知調查團之感想何如。</p>
<p>國聯調查團之組織。依據去年十二月十日行政院之决議第五欵及第六欵就决議案條文略加研究。益以白里安之宣言可知調查團之任務至爲廣泛。當九一八事變之初。我施代表早有撤兵與調查兩提議薛西爾爵士亦嘗極力斡旋。催促芳澤容納而芳澤於撤兵。則佯爲允諾於調查則嚴詞拒絕洎乎第三次會議開會於巴黎。日本軍隊非但一兵未撤抑且變本加厲佔錦州逼熱河東北全部。均落日本之手斯時日本反提出調查團之建議其用心所在固不難預測也。</p>
<p>惟調查團之任務。爲國聯所付託。旣非代表某一國家更非代表某一方面。其立塲完全以國聯盟約爲基礎其行動惟國聯訓令是聽。盟約之根本精神。爲會員國間之平等待遇昔一九二五年布希糾紛。白里安曾堅决宣言。「國際聯盟之組織份子。爲强弱不一。大小不等之國家。但其待遇。一律平等。各享共同之正義而無分軒輊。」白氏斯言。對盟約之根本精神。解釋最爲透切依據斯旨。則日本屢謂我中國無組織不配受國聯待遇等之宣傳。巳不攻自破。</p>
<p>去年十二月二十五日。團員希德博士宣言「當悉心傾聽雙方陳述。以坦白態。度報告眞相。以平等公平之基礎。爲工作應當遵守之原則。」調查團在東京宣言。亦欲以「第三者之立塲。持公平之態度。」我人希望調查團。始終保持此公正的立塲。</p>
<p>其次國聯以會員國相互尊重「領土完整政治獨立」爲最高原則。最近西班牙代表蘇魯太在大會宣稱。「盟約第十條爲國聯之最高憲章」歷次行政院决議。亦曾再三致意二月十七日行政院致日申請書。對斯原則。尤明白表示。「凡不顧本條文而侵犯任何會員國之土地完整與變更其政治獨立者。其餘會員國皆不得認爲有效」蓋會員國若不能履行第十條之國際義務。則國際和平。即無從維持。日本始終揚言對我無土地與政治野心。而其破壞盟約之種種行爲。則早爲列國所公認。誠如瑞士代表摩太之言。「敵對行爲之發作。巳越過第十五條所載偶然事故之外。」惜乎盟約國對於解决國際糾紛之手段。非常緩慢。致成今日僵局。則今日調查團。宜如何於尊重最高憲章之精神下。迅行其調查工作。以完成此法律的原則也。</p>
<p>調查團之立塲與其工作之原則旣皆有法理之根據。其所調查之事實。自當與法理相符合苟事實與法律不相符合。則調查之記錄。將等於尋常之遊記。行政院决議明白規定。「就地研究任何情形。影響國際關係而有擾亂中日兩國和平者」則調查團所應搜集之事實。爲影響國際關係與擾亂中日和平之事實。亦即違反國聯盟約破壞國際和平之事實。惟此項事實。乃爲法律的事實。調查團若欲以第　者之立塲。持公平之態度。着手調查。則其所應注意者。亦惟斯法律的事實而巳。除此以外。調查團更有何求。</p>
<p>今調查團將往東北開始其工作矣吾氏族含苦忍痛以迄於今。自始即遵照盟約。信任國聯以愛好和平之切。希望國聯之殷。故責備國聯亦愈嚴。揆諸巳往。不得不深責國聯之缺乏果斷。坐視事態之日益擴大。調查團其將起而圖亡羊之補牢乎。我人姑拭目以視之。</p>

<h3>Announcement to the League of Nations Investigation Team</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Team will arrive in Shanghai today. The members of the team have travelled across vast oceans, enduring a long and arduous journey. They come bearing the significant mission entrusted to them by the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the scope of Japanese aggression has been expanding, and the situation has become increasingly serious. It is recalled that on January 21st, Aristide Briand informed the members of the Administrative Council that "the state in which the investigation team begins its work differs greatly from what was expected on the day of the resolution." Unexpectedly, after delays until today, the situation is even more different than before. Japan has not ceased its occupation of the Northeast; it has now continued with disasters in the Southeast. Today, as the investigation team arrives in Shanghai, they see in the Wusong area, pieces upon pieces of shattered tiles and debris, a scene full of devastation. Comparing this to the sorrow of Belgium during the European war, one wonders what the feelings of the investigation team will be.</p>
<p>The organization of the League of Nations Investigation Team is based on the fifth and sixth clauses of the resolution of the Administrative Council on December 10th of last year. After slightly studying the clauses of the resolution, supplemented by Briand's declaration, it is clear that the mission of the investigation team is extremely broad. At the beginning of the September 18th Incident, our representative Shi Zhao had already proposed both withdrawal of troops and investigation. Sir Eric Drummond also made great efforts to mediate, urging Yoshizawa Kenkichi to accept, but Yoshizawa pretended to agree to the troop withdrawal while sternly rejecting the investigation. When the third meeting was held in Paris, not only had the Japanese troops not withdrawn a single soldier, but they had intensified their actions, occupying Jinzhou and forcing Rehe, and the entire Northeast fell into Japanese hands. At that time, Japan turned around and proposed the establishment of an investigation team, and their intentions were not difficult to foresee.</p>
<p>However, the mission of the investigation team is entrusted by the League of Nations. It does not represent a certain country, nor does it represent a certain side. Its position is entirely based on the Covenant of the League of Nations, and its actions only follow the instructions of the League of Nations. The fundamental spirit of the Covenant is the equal treatment of member states. In the Bush-Greece dispute of 1925, Aristide Briand firmly declared, "The members of the League of Nations are countries of different strengths and sizes, but their treatment is uniformly equal. Each enjoys common justice without discrimination." Briand's words provide the most thorough explanation of the fundamental spirit of the Covenant. According to this principle, Japan's repeated propaganda that China is disorganized and not qualified to receive League of Nations treatment is self-defeating.</p>
<p>On December 25th of last year, team member Dr. Heinrich Schnee declared, "We will listen carefully to the statements of both sides, report the truth with an open attitude, and take equality and fairness as the principles to be followed in our work." The investigation team's declaration in Tokyo also stated that they wanted to "take the position of a third party and maintain a fair attitude." We hope that the investigation team will maintain this fair position throughout.</p>
<p>Secondly, the League of Nations takes "respect for the territorial integrity and political independence" of member states as its highest principle. Recently, Spanish representative Salvador de Madariaga declared at the General Assembly, "Article 10 of the Covenant is the highest charter of the League of Nations." Previous resolutions of the Administrative Council have also repeatedly emphasized this. In its application to Japan on February 17th, the Administrative Council clearly stated this principle: "If any member state disregards this article and infringes upon the territorial integrity of any member state or changes its political independence, the other member states shall not recognize it as valid." If member states cannot fulfill the international obligations of Article 10, then international peace cannot be maintained. Japan has consistently claimed that it has no territorial or political ambitions towards China, but its various actions that violate the Covenant have long been recognized by other nations. As Swiss representative Motta said, "The outbreak of hostile acts has gone beyond the accidental events described in Article 15." It is regrettable that the means by which the Covenant countries resolve international disputes are very slow, leading to the current stalemate. Therefore, today's investigation team should quickly carry out its investigation work under the spirit of respecting the highest charter to complete this legal principle.</p>
<p>Since the position of the investigation team and the principles of its work are all based on legal principles, the facts it investigates should naturally be consistent with legal principles. If the facts are not consistent with the law, then the investigation records will be equivalent to ordinary travel notes. The Administrative Council's resolution clearly stipulates, "Study on the spot any situation that affects international relations and disturbs the peace between China and Japan." Therefore, the facts that the investigation team should collect are facts that affect international relations and disturb the peace between China and Japan, that is, facts that violate the Covenant of the League of Nations and undermine international peace. However, this fact is a legal fact. If the investigation team wants to take the position of a third party and maintain a fair attitude to begin the investigation, then what it should pay attention to is only this legal fact. What else does the investigation team need besides this?</p>
<p>Now the investigation team will go to the Northeast to begin its work. Our people have endured suffering until now. From the beginning, we have followed the Covenant and trusted the League of Nations with a deep love of peace and a profound hope for the League of Nations. Therefore, our criticism of the League of Nations is also more severe. Looking back on the past, we cannot help but deeply criticize the League of Nations for its lack of decisiveness, watching the situation expand day by day. Will the investigation team rise up to mend the fold after the sheep is lost? We will wait and see.</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Investigation Team Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>1.  Hope the Investigation Team Pays Attention to the Facts and Truth Since the Outbreak of the Shanghai Incident and is Not Obscured by One-Sided Information</p>
<p>2.  Hope the Investigation Team Investigates the Northeast Incident with a Fair Attitude Based on the Spirit of the League of Nations Resolution</p>
<p>The members of the League of Nations Investigation Team arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the Da Lai Company's steamship "President Adams" on the 11th of this month.

<h3>The People's Diplomatic Support Association The People's</h3>
<p>Diplomatic Support Association telegraphed the whole country's People's Book for the League of Nations Investigation Team coming to China, since the incidents in Liaoning and Shanghai occurred one after another, our government fully trusted the League of Nations in the responsibility of maintaining world peace and respecting various international conventions, hoping to restrain the violent Japanese and promote justice, but in fact, it was counterproductive, which we regret. Now that the International League Investigation Country has come to China from Japan, we do not need to be as extravagant and gorgeous as Japan, and deliberately fawn on making something, but to expose the true evidence of the Japanese invasion to our investigation team for reference, which is proper and indispensable. At the same time, we must reveal Japan's conspiracy to declare an armistice and to encroach on me step by step so that the investigation team can criticize the truth and falsehood and right and wrong of the facts with a fair attitude. We also wish the people of the whole country to strictly urge the government to implement revolutionary diplomacy at this time when peace and war are not yet determined, so as not to lose power and humiliate the country and disgrace the glory of the Chinese nation. The telegram is urgent and infinitely hopeful. The Chinese People's Diplomatic Support Association bowed. Yuan</p>
<h3>Two Roads Party Department, etc. Two Roads Special Party Department</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee, etc., sent a telegram to the newspaper offices to understand that they had sent a telegram to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to welcome the League of Nations Investigation Team to Shanghai to investigate, the original text said, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs transferred the League of Nations Investigation Team to understand, Japan relied on its violence to show its ferocity, first forcibly occupied my Northeast 200,000 square miles, then disturbed my Tianjin Qingdao Fuzhou coastal cities, recently attacked my Songhu, invaded my hinterland, destroyed culture, and destroyed transportation The places where the Japanese army passed were filled with rivers of blood, and countless houses were built, and my unarmed people who died in the Japanese army's blade were tens of thousands. My public and private property destroyed by the Japanese army's artillery fire was more than hundreds of millions. Such atrocities disregard humanity and destroy the integrity of my territory and administration. The dignity of all international conventions and laws is trampled on and extinguished. Our Chinese people can't bear it, for the survival of the nation, for the personality of the country, self-defense and resistance, and the world sympathizes. Now fortunately, the fair and just international investigation team, entrusted by the League of Nations, is making on-the-spot observations, and the news is broadcast, and the whole country is rejoicing. My Chinese nation loves peace and is willing to uphold justice and public law with blood and sincerity and sanction the powerful. When your investigation team comes to Shanghai, we extend our warm respect and welcome you, and we hope to be informed, Chinese Kuomintang Jinghu Huhu Ningbo Railway Special Party Department Executive Committee, Ministry of Railways directly under the Jinghu Huhu Ningbo Railway Trade Union, Chinese Transportation Society, Jinghu Huhu Ningbo Railway Jiaotong University Alumni Association, Jinghu Huhu Ningbo Two Roads Fellow Association, Yuan Yin,</p>

<h3>New Impressions After the League of Nations Resolution Was Released</h3>
<p>The United States Cooperates with the League of Nations on the Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>(Washington) Tonight, the official scene announced that the United States is prepared to cooperate with Britain, France and Italy, and according to the plan passed by the League of Nations yesterday, to arrange for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shanghai, (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Banquet for the New Envoy of Peace</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Since the death of French Foreign Minister Briand, British Representative Simon has succeeded as the new envoy of world peace. Yesterday night, before leaving for Paris, he invited Chinese Representative Yan Huijing, Japanese Representative Matsudaira, and American observers Wilson and Davis for the Bin Yang Incident. In addition to seeing each other at the meetings of the Council or the General Assembly, this was still the</p>
<p>first face-to-face meeting. Moreover, the invited guests also had American observers, which shows the importance of this banquet. It is heard that Chinese and Japanese representatives can discuss all the problems between China and Japan in the most friendly spirit under the good offices of Simon (National News Agency, 12th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Attitude Towards the League of Nations is Still Tough</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The military authorities here all expressed their firm opposition to the resolution of the League of Nations Council. They meant that the Japanese army had no reason to bear any obligations to the League of Nations, because Japan had announced the cessation of hostilities and stated that it would withdraw its troops when the overall situation in Shanghai returned to its original state. China does not have a solid foundation for its establishment, and I do not know why the League of Nations should be compared with Japan. The authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also expressed the same opinion as the military authorities, believing that Japan has no legal obligation to accept any resolution of the League of Nations Council, because Japan raised reservations about the implementation of Article 15 of the Charter when it participated in the Council (Translated from Dalian Daily, 12th, Japanese United Press</p>
<p>She Dian)</p>

<h3>Wellington Koo Receives Chinese and Foreign Reporters</h3>
<p>Hope for the League of Nations</p>
<p>Explain China's Wishes</p>
<p>Dr. Wellington Koo received reporters from various Chinese newspapers and news agencies at the Cangzhou Hotel on the previous two days to solicit opinions on the Northeast and Shanghai cases. Yesterday afternoon, he received reporters from various foreign newspapers and news agencies at the Cathay Hotel. The general outline of his speech is as follows,</p>
<p>"The League of Nations Investigation Team is about to arrive in China, so that the relations between China and Japan will find a ray of dawn in the dark, which shows that the countries of the world are extremely concerned about the Far East problem and deeply know that the proper solution of this problem and whether the world peace can be maintained will be transferred accordingly. Moreover, the main remarks in the League of Nations General Assembly make me have unlimited hope. They will carefully examine the relationship and influence of the Sino-Japanese dispute on international cooperation, and have repeatedly stated that they are willing to maintain the machine of kindness and compassion without falling, and the League of Nations is the incarnation of this machine, so they do not want to abandon this bright road and stray into the wrong path. It is indeed difficult to maintain peace and protect the dignity of treaties and oppose the use of force to resolve international disputes. However, it can now be proved that the United States is sincerely cooperating with the League of Nations in handling affairs, and this is also gratifying. China loves peace and is consistent from beginning to end, so it is extremely willing to cooperate sincerely with the United States and other member states of the League of Nations. Since the Northeast Incident of the Sino-Japanese dispute occurred, although Japan has tried its best to establish a puppet government, China has strictly abided by the resolutions of the Executive Council of the League of Nations. As far as the Shanghai Incident is concerned, Japan has also invaded with the same troops as in the Northeast, creating the current situation. The Chinese government, in view of the resolutions of the League of Nations General Assembly, has once again stated that it is willing to open negotiations with Japan to solve this situation urgently. In short, China's only requirement is to determine an armistice to prevent the tragedy of destruction, and to quickly withdraw the Japanese troops, so as to eliminate the greatest crisis of peace, and to declare that it will no longer invade, in order to show sincerity in seeking peace. In short, what China requires is only the necessary rights that a sovereign country should have, and it has no other requests except those guaranteed by international law and international treaties. What China wants is peace, and now it is only waiting for Japan to make it happen"</p>

<p>Judges Argue That Most of the Traitors in Zhabei are</p>
<p>From Jiangbei, Extorting and Plundering Each Household. Rosewood Tables are Sold for Only Three Yuan. However, No One is Consulting. These Traitors are Especially Afraid That Once the Japanese Troops Withdraw and the Police Power is Restored, Their Shacks Cannot Conceal Valuable Equipment and High-Grade Clothing. Therefore, They Pretend to be Evacuating and Moving Their Homes Every Day, Transporting Them to the Concession in Order to Hide or Sell Them. The Public Concession Police Learned of This and Deployed Detectives Widely at the Border, Strictly Interrogating Those Who Transported Items by Cart. Moreover, a Group of Traitors Usually Engage in Carting for a Living. Once They Wear Fur Coats and Carry Large Amounts of Valuable Items, Their Demeanor and Actions Cannot be the Same. Moreover, When Asked About Their Occupation, They Forgetfully State Their Original Occupation, Resulting in at Least Twenty Such Traitors Being Captured Every Day. More Than One Hundred People Have Been Sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau One After Another, and They Have Now All Been Transferred to the Local Court for Trial. Most of the Stolen Goods are Clothing. The Stolen Goods Warehouse is Piled Up Like a Mountain, and There is No Lack of Valuable Fur Coats Such as Fox and Rat Skins. The Court Has Already Issued a Notice Calling on the Families Who Have Been Robbed to Identify Their Belongings. Regarding These Treacherous People, All the Judges Believe That They Cannot be Treated the Same as Ordinary Criminals and Intend to Impose Uniformly Severe Punishment.</p>

This suggestion from your association is complete and meticulous. If it can be implemented, it will be enough to make the villains slightly more cautious. However, various associations must conduct strict investigations at any time and must not be biased in favor of anyone in order to be effective. I think your association also shares this sentiment."</p>

<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Education Orders That Newly Established Private Middle Schools Only be Allowed to Enroll First-Year Students</h3>
<p>Schools Must Submit Changes in Organization to the Bureau for Approval</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education instructed private secondary schools in this city, stating: "Recently, private secondary schools in this city have been enrolling students or changing their original organizations. Some have failed to comply with the regulations, which has led to disputes. It is urgent to correct this. According to Instruction No. 205 of the Ministry of Education, 'In order to rectify private schools, the Ministry has repeatedly ordered the rectification or closure of schools that have been found to be poorly managed or in violation of the law, and the disposal methods should be clearly stipulated for compliance.' 'Schools that are newly established are only allowed to enroll first-year students in order to prevent abuses,' etc., have already been recorded and announced by this Bureau. However, recently, newly established schools have arbitrarily enrolled second- and third-year students, which not only violates the Ministry's order but also causes disputes. This is not right. Also, according to Article 2 of the Regulations for Private Schools, 'If a private school is to be changed or closed, it must be approved by the competent educational administrative organ.' However, recently, some secondary schools in this city have failed to comply.</p>
<p>For example, if it was originally a junior high school, it suddenly opened a senior high school, or if it originally had a senior high school, it suddenly</p>
<p>stopped it. Or, if it originally only requested to open a senior high school, it suddenly added a normal education department or other vocational departments. The organization is changed without first complying with the regulations and obtaining approval, which makes it difficult to assess. It is also inappropriate. In the future, if private secondary schools in this city</p>
<p>New schools that enroll new students, and existing schools that change their organizations</p>
<p>Must comply with the established regulations and proceed step by step. If there is any failure to comply with the established regulations</p>
<p>This Bureau will definitely ban it. It is especially important to reiterate the previous order, hoping that all affiliated schools will comply with it without violating this order."</p>

<p>The Yangzhou Eight Counties, Jianghuai Six Counties, and Tongru Chonghai and other three fellow associations believed that many of the traitors in this city were from Jiangbei, so various circles had many criticisms. Therefore, the associations entertained the press in this city at the Atlantic Chaishe at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 40 reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended. First, Chairman Song Shixiang reported the significance of the entertainment, saying that all Chinese people hate the violent Japanese invasion of Shanghai, and some ignorant people have helped the tyrants and acted as traitors, which is a shame for the entire nation. However, people in the society despise Jiangbei people because most of those captured are from Jiangbei. In fact, this kind of behavior is definitely not what the knowledgeable circles would do. I hope the press will pay attention, etc. Then, Jiang Huaixu (Yangzhou), Gu Nanqun (Tongru), and Cheng Xichun (Jianghuai) successively made speeches on behalf of them. Finally, reporters Fan Jingwu and Zhu Chaoran gave replies. It was over 4:00 PM, and everyone dispersed in joy.</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Suicide of the Match King of Sweden</h3>
<p>Due to Nervous Exhaustion, He Became Pessimistic</p>
<p>Some Say Financial Difficulties Led to This Desperate Measure</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 12th - Ivar Kreuger, the famous Swedish Match King, committed suicide due to overwork and nervous exhaustion. Kreuger had just arrived here from the United States yesterday and was scheduled to hold a business meeting with British, French, and American bankers this morning. When he did not arrive after the appointed time, people were sent to find him and discovered that he had committed suicide. Havas, Paris, 12th - The Match King Kreuger, who recently returned from the United States, had arranged to meet with several financiers. This morning, a Mr. Li Daolin, one of those Kreuger had invited, waited for a long time without Kreuger appearing. He went to Kreuger's residence to inquire, and upon entering the room, found Kreuger neatly dressed, lying on his bed with a gunshot wound through his heart. He had been dead for some time. On the table were three letters, one addressed to Mr. Li, one to the deceased's sister, and one to a friend living in the Swedish capital. In the letters, Kreuger expressed his despair and stated that he had been experiencing extreme financial difficulties for several months, hence this desperate measure. People close to Kreuger said that he had been overworked and in poor health, which led to his pessimism. Kreuger held a very important position in the world of commerce, and the news of his death has shocked all sectors. According to the police investigation, as of today, it is certain that it was a suicide. His remains will be autopsied according to regulations to determine the cause of death.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Stockholm, 11th - Famous financier and director of the Swedish Match Company, Mr. Franke, died suddenly of a fainting spell today upon hearing the news of Kreuger's death.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 12th - Today, the French Ministry of the Interior announced that Mr. Kreuger, the owner of the Swedish Kreuger &amp; Toll company, had been found dead from a gunshot wound in a Paris hotel. He was holding a piece of paper claiming that his death would be more beneficial to his enterprise and family. The Kreuger &amp; Toll company is deeply involved in international finance, and Kreuger's death is expected to have a worldwide impact. The company has connections with the International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company and has obtained match monopoly rights and other rights in many countries in South America, Poland, and Romania. The company also lent a large sum of money to Germany, and it is currently owed 50 million U.S. dollars. If the extremist party is elected president of Germany, this loan will be adversely affected, so this matter will have a significant impact on the German election.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Stockholm, 12th - Because many Swedish businesses are experiencing financial difficulties, and the news of Kreuger's suicide has caused widespread panic, the Swedish government has decided to temporarily suspend trading on the stock exchange for several days, starting on Monday. The Council of State has convened a special meeting, and after the meeting, a special bill will be submitted to both houses of parliament authorizing the King, after consulting with the National Bank and the National Debt Office, to allow companies unable to make payments due to circumstances. Financial experts in Stockholm generally believe that Kreuger's suicide was not due to bankruptcy but rather due to excessive nervous stimulation given the tense situation of Swedish businesses.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Stockholm, 12th - Swedish Prime Minister Ekman has convened a special session of parliament, scheduled to meet at midnight tomorrow, to consider government loans and allowing domestic private companies to suspend payments to prevent the Kreuger &amp; Toll company from being squeezed. It is now known that the proposal to convene a special session of parliament was prepared before the news of Kreuger's death arrived from Paris. It is said that doubts about the Kreuger &amp; Toll company's ability to meet its debts have been circulating for several days. The Swedish government has recalled several bankers from abroad to jointly devise a plan to deal with the aftermath.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Stockholm, 12th - The Match King Kreuger, one of the world's richest men, suddenly committed suicide in Paris. The news of his death has caused a great shock here. It is said that the reason for his suicide was due to years of hard work and nervous exhaustion. Kreuger was born in 1880. His family moved from Germany to Kalmar, Sweden, at the beginning of this century. Kreuger studied engineering and then went to the United States. A few years before the European war, he returned to his hometown and met a young banker named Toll. The two then jointly formed the Kreuger &amp; Toll Construction Company. Thanks to Kreuger's diligence and Toll's financial management skills, the business flourished. During the European war and in the years that followed, the two made huge profits and accumulated enormous wealth. They then turned their attention to other industries and decided to reorganize and merge the Swedish match companies to form an international match trust, with unparalleled financial strength. They successively obtained match monopoly rights in Germany, Poland, Romania, and several countries in South America. They also skillfully cultivated relationships and provided loans to governments facing financial difficulties in exchange for the match monopoly rights of those countries. The Kreuger &amp; Toll company was the main force in the trust, and its shares were traded on almost all stock exchanges worldwide. Later, they organized a large financial group that dominated the time. However, recently, rumors have been spreading that the trust's investments and operations have suffered losses due to the decline in the pound and the global economic downturn, resulting in a large portion of its assets being illiquid. Recently, Kreuger has been traveling tirelessly, shuttling between European cities and crossing the Atlantic several times, seemingly to struggle to resolve the crisis. Now, it appears that he committed suicide due to failure. Kreuger's death will inevitably cause another major blow to the match trust, as most of its assets were owned by Kreuger, and Kreuger was the cornerstone of the trust. Although Kreuger was rich, he lived a simple life, advocated abstinence from alcohol, and never married, saying that in his busy position, he had no time to take care of family life.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th - This morning, London newspapers published the news of the Swedish Match King Kreuger's suicide, giving it even greater prominence than the news of the German presidential election. All newspapers recognized this as an unfortunate event for Sweden that will have a significant impact on the financial world. When Kreuger was found dead, he was neatly dressed, lying on a cot in his Paris residence. Beside him was a pistol, and a bullet had pierced his chest. Letters were found in the room, in which Kreuger admitted to being tired of life and cited financial difficulties as the reason. It is said that yesterday, about 50,000 shares of Kreuger company stock were sold on Wall Street in New York. According to the *Sunday Referee*, the value of Kreuger company stock has fallen by 11.3 million pounds since 1930.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the German Presidential Election</h3>
<p>Voter Turnout is Very Enthusiastic</p>
<p>Hindenburg Has Hope of Being Elected</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 13th - Today is the day of the German presidential election. To prevent disturbances, the authorities began strict precautions yesterday, even in many rural areas, with police vigilance. This is because political figures have frequently mentioned the crisis of internal turmoil in their election speeches, and recently, rumors have been rampant that Hitler's Brown Shirt Storm Troopers will march on Berlin if their leader is defeated. Therefore, the whole country is very tense. In addition, rumors are circulating that the government, regardless of how many votes Hitler receives, is prepared to use force to prevent him from taking power. Government officials have now strongly denied the falsehood of this claim, but baseless rumors continue. Yesterday, Hitler personally issued a declaration in Hanover, urging his party comrades to vote peacefully, but his reason was that his party's strength did not need to rely on force to place him on the presidential throne. There are five candidates for president this time. In addition to the current President Hindenburg, Hitler, nominated by the National Socialist Party, has considerable strength and is Hindenburg's strong rival. In addition, Colonel Duesterberg, nominated by the National People's Party, Selman, nominated by the Communist Party, and Wende, an independent candidate, have little hope, and Wende is in prison, so he is merely a placeholder. If none of the five candidates receive a majority of the votes today, a runoff election will be held on April 10.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 13th - Today, voters for the German presidential election are very enthusiastic. When the polling stations opened at 9:00 a.m., countless voters were already gathered at the entrances, waiting to vote. By noon today, the number of voters was so large that it could be determined that the number of votes cast this time would set a new record. Reports from various provinces on the voting situation show that the enthusiasm is similar to that in Berlin. The police are maintaining strict vigilance all day, and no major disturbances have occurred by noon. It seems that the temporary ban on the sale of liquor and the ban on party youth from parading in vehicles have been effective in maintaining order. Special police forces have been assigned to the polling places of the President, the Prime Minister, and cabinet members. Citizens gathered there early in the morning to watch the important figures come to vote. Later, several thousand people gathered in front of the presidential palace, wanting to see Hindenburg's appearance, but Hindenburg was even more reclusive today than usual and did not appear on the balcony. Seeing that Hindenburg did not come out, the crowd gradually dispersed.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 13th - Although today is the presidential election and all sectors are focused on the election, the news of the suicide of the Swedish financier and Match King Kreuger has struck the Berlin financial world like a bomb. Newspapers are also using large fonts to publish the news, and financial editors are speculating on the reasons for his suicide. The general opinion is that the published explanations of overwork and nervous breakdown are not credible. It is believed that the stocks of the various companies related to Kreuger have been falling in recent weeks, and his financial position must be extremely tight. Now that he has passed away, it is feared that it will cause a major upheaval in the business world. However, the scope and urgency of the turmoil are difficult to predict at this time because Kreuger's investments are so widespread and the truth is unclear. Finally, it is expected that the German authorities may be forced to temporarily suspend trading on the stock exchange tomorrow to avoid adverse effects on the market.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 12th - General von François, who previously served as Hindenburg's chief of staff in the field, has now issued an article saying that he still loves his old master, but he does not want to vote for him because he does not approve of Hindenburg's support for Brüning. General Schuchard, also a famous general during the war, who previously belonged to the Stahlhelm (Steel Helmet), has now been expelled from the Stahlhelm for advising his party members not to elect Duesterberg, the leader of the Stahlhelm, as president. Hitler, the leader of the National Socialist Party, stated that the National Socialist Party has no reason to abandon legal actions, but his words have not been able to dispel the rumors circulating in the Cologne area that if Hitler is not elected tomorrow, the National Socialist Party will take unexpected actions. Berlin and various parts of Germany are now very anxious, fearing that the actions of the National Socialist Party will inevitably provoke the active opposition of the Socialist Party. Catholics in Cologne are now supporting Hindenburg.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Simon Goes to Paris</h3>
<p>To Express Condolences at Briand's Funeral</p>
<p>And Discuss Disarmament Issues with Tardieu</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th - British Foreign Secretary Simon left Geneva last night and arrived in Paris this morning, where he was received by French Prime Minister Tardieu. They talked from 10:00 a.m. to noon. A statement issued by the British Foreign Office said that Foreign Secretary Simon went to Paris today to personally carry the pall at Briand's funeral and to express the condolences of the British government and people to Tardieu. He then discussed the situation in Geneva with Tardieu, both of whom were pleased that the final resolution of the League of Nations had been adopted by the members. They also discussed the issues to be discussed at next week's disarmament conference. Simon and Tardieu also considered the difficulties currently facing the two governments, especially the economic situation of the countries of Central Europe, and both felt that Britain and France should expand their cooperation to quell political competition in Europe and promote European economic reconstruction.</p>

<h3>Japanese Abolish Various Official Banks in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Re-Establishing a Fake Central Bank</p>
<p>Yantai Correspondence - Since the Japanese occupied the Northeast, the financial rights of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have also fallen. The original four official financial institutions, namely the Dongsan Province Official Bank of Liaoning, the Yongheng Official Bank of Jilin, the Heilongjiang Official Bank of Heilongjiang, and the Bianye Bank of Harbin, had their business performances noted by the Japanese. Now the Japanese have confiscated the four banks and re-established a fake central bank, with its headquarters in Changchun. It began operations on March 1. Branch offices have been established in Shenyang, Jilin, Harbin, and Qiqihar, and branch locations have been established in Jinzhou, Suizhong, Zhengjiatun, and Hailong. All the banknotes previously issued by the various banks in the Northeast are now uniformly invalidated and replaced by new banknotes issued by the fake central bank. The assets of the four major banks in the Northeast total more than 366 million.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Japanese Goods Imported into Qingdao</h3>
<p>Imports Worth Several Million Dollars in the Past Two Months</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence - Recently, Japanese goods have flooded this city. According to sources at the wharf, there are no fewer than 50 or 60 merchants engaging in illicit trade in the city. In the past two months, Japanese goods worth approximately several million dollars have been imported. It has been found that on the 4th of this month, the Nikko Maru imported more than 20,000 bags of flour and more than 17,000 pieces of cloth and white sugar. The cloth was purchased and transported by several companies, including Wanliyuan, Hehezhai, Yidezai, and Dongxianghao, and the white sugar was purchased and transported by various companies, including Yijudong and Fujudong. On the 8th, a certain ship imported more than 5,000 bags of white sugar, including 1,000 bags for Yijudong, 1,500 bags for Fengchanglong, 500 bags for Yichengyong, 250 bags for Hengyugong, and 2,000 bags for Hehezhai. The actions of these illicit merchants are blatant, which is truly regrettable. (March 9th)</p>

<h3>The National Government and the Party Headquarters Commemorate the Death of Sun Yat-sen</h3>
<p>Luoyang National Government: The National Government held a memorial service for the seventh anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death at 9:00 a.m. on the 12th in the Great Hall. Chairman Lin presided over the ceremony and reported that today is the seventh anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. Although Sun Yat-sen himself has passed away, Sun Yat-sen's spirit will always exist and will never die. Seven years ago, when Sun Yat-sen was critically ill and dying in Beijing, he told us a few last words: Peace, struggle, save China. This peace is the characteristic of the Chinese nation. What the ancient sages called gentleness, kindness, respect, thrift, and humility is the expression of this characteristic. Sun Yat-sen identified this characteristic as the spirit of our nation, so he first put forward these two words to teach us. China is a vast and resource-rich country, and since history, it has embraced all countries in the world with goodwill and treated them with courtesy. It has never had the intention or action of aggression or seizure. Therefore, China has always advocated the way of benevolence and been ashamed of the way of force. Because it advocates the way of benevolence, from individuals to the nation, it has always embraced the principle of winning people over with virtue rather than force. Although Sun Yat-sen first reminded us of these two words, because peace is only the standard of human survival morality and not the absolute condition for survival in a competitive world, after the word peace, he then said the word struggle. Only by being able to struggle can China be saved. Sun Yat-sen's will asks us to maintain the characteristics of the Chinese nation and win people over with virtue on the one hand, and to struggle for survival and seek the independence, freedom, and equality of the nation on the other. In other words, we must not forget to struggle for peace, and we must not forget peace for struggle. Then we can save the country and turn weakness into strength. This is especially worthy of our understanding, practice, and never forgetting in this time of national crisis. Sun Yat-sen's last will is the supreme and perfect stone to save the country. I hope that government officials at all levels and the people of the whole country will wake up together, remember it in their hearts, revive the decline, and save the nation. It all depends on this.</p>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: At 10:00 a.m. on the same day, the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held a memorial service for the seventh anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death at Heluo Middle School. More than 400 people attended, including members of the Central Committee, staff of the Central Party Headquarters, representatives from various government agencies in Luoyang, party, government, and military agencies, and various organizations. After Chairman Lin Sen led the ceremony, Li Liejun reported that under the current serious situation, the memorial service for the seventh anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death is being held in Luoyang. Recalling how we admired Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime, recalling how sad we were when Sun Yat-sen died, and examining how we have failed to earnestly implement Sun Yat-sen's will in recent years and comfort the people's hopes, how ashamed we are. Sun Yat-sen devoted his life to the revolution, never giving up. The greatness of his spirit, personality, and career, and the breadth and nobility of his scholarship and morality, are all models for the world, and what is especially unattainable is his spirit of universal love and his spirit of fearlessness. In the seven years since Sun Yat-sen's death, internal strife has been rampant and achievements have been scarce. Now, a major disaster is serious. We should all be saddened that Japan has had ambitions to invade our country for decades. Sun Yat-sen had already seen through their conspiracy. The reason why we have not been able to prevent it until now is because we have failed to develop Sun Yat-sen's spirit of universal love and his spirit of fearlessness. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of universal love is embodied in the Three Principles of the People. He sought equal rights for all nationalities within the country and sought the liberation of all oppressed nationalities in the world, which is nationalism. He sought to ensure that all people have food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, which is the people's livelihood. He practiced universal politics, opposed class dictatorship, and sought equality for the people in politics, which is democracy. To achieve the realization of the Three Principles of the People, we must start with the implementation of democracy. Sun Yat-sen did not fear the strong or avoid difficulties in his life. Wherever justice was and wherever the principles were concerned, he would rise up and eliminate all difficulties, even if they were insurmountable. At present, we have the greatest determination to resist Japan for a long time, and we should emulate Sun Yat-sen, promote the spirit of universal love, and display the spirit of fearlessness, so that everyone is of one mind and the whole country is united, so that internal strife does not arise and society is stable. If we consider both internal peace and external resistance, then the national crisis can be saved and foreign aggression is not to be feared. We can comfort Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven and live up to the expectations of the people of the whole country.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Troops Rush to Support Jiangxi and Fujian</h3>
<p>The First Army Rushes to Jiangxi from Northern Guangdong</p>
<p>The Independent Division Sets Out for the Fujian Border from Huizhou</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The banditry situation in Jiangxi and Fujian has recently become more rampant, and Ganzhou and Shanghang are both very dangerous. Regarding Ganzhou, the city of Ganzhou has recently been besieged by the Communist Third Army Group. The siege has not been lifted since the 26th of last month. The supplies of the defending Ma Kun Brigade are nearly exhausted, and they are on the verge of collapse. Yesterday, a telegram was sent urgently to Guangdong requesting troops, saying that the Communist Third Army Group had started the siege on the 26th and that the east, west, and south gates had been blown up successively, and they had repeatedly stormed the city but were repelled. Later, the bandits used artillery and machine guns to cover their elite troops in a fierce attack. They fell one after another without stopping. Our side ran out of ammunition and resorted to hand-to-hand combat. The shouts shook the sky, and the bandits' corpses piled up. Some were even beheaded on the city walls and fell outside the city. We have suffered heavy casualties, and the opportunity for survival is imminent. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers are fighting hard and have repelled the bandits. According to the bandits' claims, if they cannot enter the city in three days, they will also admire your 34th Brigade (referring to the Ma Kun Brigade) as an Iron Army, which shows their discouragement. Please urge the reinforcements to advance day and night, and it will not be difficult to encircle and annihilate them. The 34th Brigade Commander Ma Kun and all the officers and soldiers kowtow urgently. Upon receiving the report, the Guangdong authorities ordered the First Army in Northern Guangdong to rush to support. It was found that the First Army of Yu Hanmou had already prepared for the advance. The vanguard of the troops entering Jiangxi, the First Independent Brigade of Fan Dexing, encountered bandits near Xinxu in Nankang on the 27th of last month, and there was a fierce battle. More than 100 soldiers were wounded and transported back to the Shaoguan Army Hospital for treatment from southern Jiangxi. Therefore, the various divisions of the First Army rushed to set out. The advance troops of the Second Division of Ye Zhao had already arrived in southern Jiangxi. The First Division of Li Zhenqiu also advanced towards the Jiangxi border after being inspected by the Army Commander Yu Hanmou on the 2nd. The Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Jiangxi, Yu Hanmou, decided to depart from Shao on the 8th. The personnel of the First Army headquarters concentrated in Shao on the 6th to await orders. The vacancy left by Yu after entering Jiangxi as the Pacification Commissioner of the Northwest Region has been filled by Li Hanhun, the chief of staff of the First Army Group. Li took office today (7th). As for the defense area left behind in Northern Guangdong, it was taken over by the Second Independent Brigade of Chen Zhang. The Second Regiment of the Jingwei Brigade of Chen Hanguang was transferred from the province to Yingde Shakou and other places to fill the defense. As of yesterday, the takeover troops have successively completed the filling of the defense. It is reported that the strength of the First Army entering Jiangxi this time is about 12 or 13 regiments, and Fan Dexing's brigade is also under the command of Yu Hanmou. As for southern Fujian, the banditry is no less severe than in southern Jiangxi. It was found that Wuping on the Fujian border was lost on the 23rd of last month. The Weishang Team of Zhong Wencai suffered successive defeats. The First Independent Brigade of the Fujian Army, Zhong Shaokui, stationed in Shanghang, moved to Sanyuanling outside the South Gate for defense. On the one hand, he sent a staff officer named Zhang to Chaozhou to request the support of Li Yangjing, the commander of the Third Army of Guangdong. On the other hand, he transferred a battalion originally stationed in Fengshi to Shanghang to reinforce it. At the moment, the 22nd Regiment of the Eighth Division of the First Army is sending Chen's battalion to take over the defense of Fengshi. Unexpectedly, the bandits invaded Yangmen in three routes on the 25th of last month. The local militia rose up to resist, and the Commander of the 22nd Regiment, Ye Shouyao, sent Peng's battalion to suppress them, and the bandits were finally repelled. The authorities believed that the Dongjiang area was facing both internal and external troubles, and the Shantou area was important and should be garrisoned by heavy troops. The Seventh and Eighth Divisions of the Third Army were ordered to concentrate in Chaozhou and Shantou. The Second Independent Division of Zhang Ruigui, originally stationed in Shantou, moved to Chaoyang County on the 1st of this month. If necessary, it will join the First Independent Division of Huang Renhuan to enter Fujian. As for the Huang Division, they are gradually departing from Huizhou. The First Brigade of Zeng Youren started on the 3rd in Puning, Haifeng, and other places. Chen Jitang personally went to Huizhou on the 4th to instruct Huang Renhuan's troops and held a review. After the review, the Huang Division set out to enter Fujian, and Chen returned to the provincial capital on the 6th. (March 7th)</p>
<h3>The Truth About Opium Eradication in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>The Opium Tax Totals 7.8 Million Dollars</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The opium ban in Anhui Province has been lifted for more than half a year. Heavy taxes are levied separately on the four items of transportation, planting, purchasing, and smoking, and a special tax office has been established. The Anhui Northern Anhui Special Tax Office was established in Bengbu early on. The current director is Fan Minqian. Recently, Fan was also ordered by the Anhui Provincial Government to concurrently handle the eradication of opium seedlings in various counties in Northern Anhui, so he set up the Anhui Northern Anhui Opium Seedling Eradication Office within the Special Tax Office. Fan originally appointed the directors of various special tax branch offices to concurrently handle the seedling eradication matters. In name, it is seedling eradication, but in reality, it is the collection of seedling tax. It is now heard that the seedling tax quotas for each county stipulated by the Anhui Northern Anhui Opium Seedling Eradication Office are still the same as those stipulated by Hao Zihua, the former director of the Anhui Special Tax Office, during his tenure. The total opium tax in Northern Anhui is 7.8 million dollars. The seedling tax quotas for each county are recorded as follows: Su County, 800,000 dollars; Lingbi, 300,000 dollars; Fengyang, 200,000 dollars; Wuhe, 100,000 dollars; Si County, 200,000 dollars; Xuyi, 150,000 dollars; Tianchang, 100,000 dollars; Chu County, 100,000 dollars; Quanjiao, 100,000 dollars; Laian, 100,000 dollars; Dingyuan, 300,000 dollars; Huaiyuan, 300,000 dollars; Mengcheng, 400,000 dollars; Guoyang, 800,000 dollars; Taihe, 400,000 dollars; Fuyang, 800,000 dollars; Huoqiu, 300,000 dollars; Yingshang, 300,000 dollars; Shou County, 150,000 dollars; Fengtai, 200,000 dollars; Hefei, 800,000 dollars; Chao County, 200,000 dollars; He County, 200,000 dollars; Hanshan, 100,000 dollars; Tongcheng, 400,000 dollars.
