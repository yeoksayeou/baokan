<p>時評</p>
<h3>讀史汀生致波拉函㈠彬</h3>
<p>最近美國務卿史汀生致函於彼國參議院外交委員長波拉。鄭重重申彼政府所持門戶開放與機會均等之一貫的政策并指明日本自去年九一八東北禍變以來之行動。爲破壞九國公約與非戰公約。在目前上海戰局日趨激烈。遠東風雲日益緊張之情勢下。此函所顯示之態度。關係國際政局至爲重大。至足以引起吾人之注意。</p>
<p>美國與我國之貿易關係。遠自十九世紀中葉清日戰後。我國爲列强所乘。寖成瓜分之勢。美國務卿海約翰爲恐其商業遭受打擊。乃於一八九九年向各國提出美國商業同其他各國得以機會均等之原則。英國首先贊同。其他各國亦相繼接受。此爲華盛頓政府門戶開放機會均等之最先確立。　　庚子之役。八國聯軍入我北京。美深恐此一原則破壞。乃通告各國須維護美國國民之生命財產。並保持中國之和平與安全。一九００年英德條約訂立。美國亦鄭重聲明關於商業機會均等。與中國領土完整。不得有任何之忽視一九一五年日對我提出二十一條之無理要脅。對門戶開放政策。作整個之摧毁。美復嚴重抗議。聲明「如有妨害美國國家及人民在中國條約上之利益。或害及中國政治上領土上之完整。或害及門戶開放政策各國工商業受均等待遇者。美國政府一律不能承認。」由是可見美政府歷來對門戶開放機會均等政策之重視。</p>
<p>至一九二一年美總統哈定發起召集華府會議。謀遠東之永久和平會中關於中國問題之討論。依據於領土主權完整機會均等門戶開放之原則。演進而爲九國公約。於是一八九九年海約翰之開放門戶政策。至此乃更得確切之保障。并對締約各國發生合法之拘束力。此一政策爲華盛頓政府對遠東問題之根本原則。自海約翰以來。蓋奉行如一日。</p>
<p>然而此一原則。最爲日本所嫉視。日本爲遠東之强國。野心勃勃。無日不企國實現其「大陸國」之幻夢。彼明知「大陸政策」與美之門戶開放政策恰相背馳。故其心目中常以美國爲假想敵。認美日在太平洋上終不免於一戰。去年九一八禍變之爆發。對於我國固爲直接的破壞我領土主權之完整。而在間接方面。則尤爲一手撕碎尊嚴神聖之九國公約。并向美國挑戰。由東北禍變之演進。更爆發此次之上海戰禍。日本之野心愈益顯明美國益愈感威脅美政府之不能再坐視遠東情勢之發展。及其自身之日即於窘境。而默不發言蓋爲吾人早所料見。</p>
<h3>上海事件</h3>
<p>敵軍待援凖備大戰</p>
<p>獅子林被敵艦砲攻</p>
<p>閘北方面火光燭天</p>
<p>無損我軍徒苦吾民</p>
<p>廟行江灣無甚劇戰</p>
<p>敵軍自向廟行江灣等處、總攻以來、集中火力、連戰兩日、屢戰屢北、其主力軍隊、實已疲乏不堪一面向其政府乞援、一面特以飛機、擾我各地、及至昨日該處已無劇烈戰事、時有稀疏之槍砲聲、聒人耳敼而已、但其十四師團已有六千餘人、於昨日運到、今日尙有續到、大約敵俟援軍到齊、或將於今晨全線大戰也、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<h3>吳淞方面戰况</h3>
<p>敵軍砲轟獅子林</p>
<p>我軍擊沉偸渡船</p>
<p>敵軍自偷渡薀藻浜一役遭受鉅創後、對於吳淞之企圖、已不敢輕於嘗試、近數日內、乃集中主力、側重江灣大塲方面、始則以步兵肉搏、但被我軍包圍、復遭重創、遂不惜以數十重砲竟日澈夜、不斷猛轟、終因我軍天賦神勇、敵絶鮮効果、非獨毫無進展、並且連連敗北、敵司令植田勢成騎虎、迭電乞援、冀挽頺勢、聞昨日吳淞口外有十餘艘大批日艦、專待各國商輪進口、即可藉作掩護長驅直入、而所載援兵約有六千餘名、現敵艦前後其達三十餘艘、聞敵現將再變戰略、又將重視吳淞矣、茲將詳情、分述於下、</p>
<p>▲敵又將變戰略據可靠方面消息、敵軍業已變更戰略、在江灣及廟行方面之敵兵、於前日築成半永久之壕溝及砲兵陣地、决用重砲轟攻我軍、一面將全部敵軍、調赴泗塘河、與薀藻浜間、自侯家木橋至紀家橋一帶之我軍陣地進攻、其目標爲楊行鎭黃家宅等處、俾斷我淞滬之聯絡、一方用大隊敵艦、進窺我淞口南北兩砲台及獅子林砲台、以爲牽制故侯家木橋紀家橋一帶、自前晨起、以至昨日下午、雙方激戰、迄未稍休、大砲聲與機關槍聲、在吳淞張華浜方面聞之異常清晰至薀藻浜至黑橋正面、敵我兩軍、昨仍隔河而守、戰綫一如開戰之初、至今絶未變化、</p>
<p>敵艦轟獅子林昨晨七時半、敵軍艦二十餘艘、集中於瀏河寳山間江面、同時以飛機七架、集中砲火、向我獅子林砲台轟炸、我軍沉着應、戰亦時發砲還擊、至十一時二十分敵機飛去而砲轟如故、掩護敵軍、圖在砲台灣登陸、俟至相當地點、停止砲擊、我軍是時乃以機關槍及迫擊砲向敵射擊、多命中、敵艦亦開砲猛擊、混戰至下午二時許、尙未停止、其所投炸彈、多爲二百五十餘磅之重彈、但我方要塞佈置極週、敵投彈雖多、大半均陷入淤土、失爆炸力、</p>
<p>敵軍運輸忙碌昨日敵艦一艘、自口外至薀藻浜往來開砲轟攻、直至十一時許方始退出口外、敵機等嗣亦沿薀藻浜向西而去、張華浜方面之敵軍、照昨日情勢觀察之、約有七八百名兵力仍極單弱、均以兩三人爲一組、伏匿於各處墳山間、張華浜海軍醫院起至鐵路小學間之軍工路上、停有敵鐵甲車四輛、昨日上午十時許有敵卡車六輸、滿裝子彈及軍用品、自楊樹浦方面、駛至張華浜卸下後、即用火車頭拖帶煤車一輛、將該項子彈沿分路輸送前方云</p>
<p>敵船擊沉三隻昨日上午十時許、張華浜糧米棧碼頭等、兵二百餘名、分乘鐵甲駁船四隻、藉依周塘以掩護、沿塘駛至薀藻浜口、希圖偷渡、當被我方外馬路駐軍覺察、即用陸戰砲轟擊敵船一時欲退不能當塲擊沉三艘敵淹斃約一百五十餘名、其最後之一艘急轉舵避入塘邊、急駛逃去、是役敵軍生還者僅五十餘人、、我方未傷一卒</p>
<p>薀藻浜敵縱火昨晨八時許、記者赴大塲視察時見東北方黑焰冲霄、細辦方位、知係吳淞附近、多方剌探、始悉敵於慘敗之餘、無聊已極、秘密派遣漢奸便衣隊多人改扮良民、偷渡薀藻浜、潛至各村落、肆行縱火、於是刦中居民又遭一炬、自昨晚至今晨、迄未稍息、加之風伯助威、施救無人、故延燒更烈、在本埠較高之處、即可遠見黑烟冲天、</p>
<h3>閘北砲聲火光</h3>
<p>敵軍偷襲均經擊退</p>
<p>中興公興等路大火</p>
<p>昨日、閘北方面日軍、自晨至晚、全用大砲飛機、向天通庵路·中興路·靑雲路·公興路·等處轟炸、擲彈結果、發生大火數處、竟日未熄、入晚七時起、天通庵虬江路方面日軍、利用少數兵士、不時向我軍偷襲、均被我軍用機關槍擊退、敵飛機於下午四時許、被我軍擊遁、砲轟至下午六時許平息、</p>
<p>入晚敵偷襲擊退昨日下午七時許、日軍於砲轟後、即撥派少數步兵三四十人不等、向虬江路·天通庵路·我軍防綫偷襲、我軍伏處戰壕、沉寂不動、日軍意爲我軍已被其砲火逼退、乃仍摸索前進、約距列軍陣地白碼左右、我軍機槍突起、日軍當者盡靡、未幾又來又遁如</p>
<p>是者三四次、嗣後日軍見無隙可乘、乃停止進行、惟仍不時用步槍遠射、我軍亦還擊、此昨晚零落槍聲與片斷機關槍聲之由來也、</p>
<p>中興路竟日大火日軍自前日起、因步兵接觸、非惟不能越我雷池一步反致喪兵折將、故改用砲轟及飛機擲彈、但結果仍不能損我分毫、昨爲敵軍施用此計之第二日、於上午五時起、即用大砲、向天通庵及閘北轟炸、同時日飛機三架、亦在閘北等處空中盤旋投彈、中興路中興里、於昨晨五時先中敵機炸彈一枚、繼中硫磺彈、立時起火、先僅在里中延燒、旋因大風助威乃漸延及鄰屋、同時敵方砲彈紛飛、墮地爆炸、更助火勢延燒至午、已將中興路對宇房屋、全付一炬、未幾鼎元里亦累及、入晚已焚及大半火勢尙有增無滅、遠望滿天通紅、正不知伊於胡底至繕稿時、火勢正向西延、九如里已在埀危中、日兵之殘酷行爲、實人間之魔鬼一天通庵路附近之公興路、於晨間起火後、亦竟日未熄、至晚間十二時、仍見火光焚熒、黑烟瀰漫、火勢不下中興路、兩處損失、不計其數、</p>
<h3>廟行江灣沉寂</h3>
<p>砲聲斷續並無劇戰</p>
<p>大批敵屍運楊樹浦</p>
<p>廟行江灣間戰事、敵自前晨總攻失敗後乃利用飛機大砲、不時向我威嚇、同時以少數部隊、擾我陣綫、自昨晨起、迄午夜止、全線沉寂、並無劇烈戰事、昨日午后四時後、江灣方面、砲聲復起、但極稀疏、我軍以敵方徒費子彈、並未還擊、</p>
<p>沿途敵屍縱橫大塲全鎭、於前日被日飛機投擲巨量炸彈三枚、立即爆炸、全錢房屋、炸毁十分之七、已成一片焦土、幸民衆均已避走、暫時躱身於附近各鄕村中、前日廟行·趙店宅·竹圍墩·孟家宅·大沈宅·一帶、日軍大敗沿途各田地上死屍堆積、血流成渠、除在我軍火線外之屍身、於昨日下午旁晚時、由日軍拖至鐵路附近、裝入大卡車上、運往楊樹浦及公大紗廠者、共計有四十八車之多、約計足有三千餘名、沿途血跡淋漓、觸目皆是、尙有手足擊壞、氣息未絶者亦均一併裝去、</p>
<p>[Ｉ&gt;劉旅長占雄　沈師長光漢　李副師長盛宗（李子洋攝）&lt;Ｉ]</p>
<p>敵司令部遷移據確息、日軍總司令部昨又移入乍浦路中某廠內、公大紗廠專藏大宗軍火、前所雇用江北人二百餘名、現在前線專任引導之職、每日每名纶洋十元</p>
<h3>敵機日夜擲彈</h3>
<p>帮助敵軍肆虐</p>
<p>傷及四鄕平民</p>
<p>敵機連日亂擲炸彈、傷害良民、大概在日間爲多、至前晚九時起、日機十餘架、忽乘吾民熟睡之際、飛往閘北彭浦眞茹一帶、擲彈五十餘枚、并放火彈、焚燒民屋、至天明方去、昨日上午亦有日本飛機多架到處擲彈、茲爲彙錄於後、</p>
<p>閘北前晚九時許、日機五架、飛至閘北大統路共和新路一帶、居民於睡夢中驚起、見似紅燈之日機五、燈光甚强、機身約略可見二架向西飛去、三架盤旋於空中、在大統路太陽廟擲彈三枚、炸廟屋一間、民房一間、傷貧民一、人至天明方去、</p>
<p>彭浦彭浦毘連閘北、故屢有日機前往偵察、前晚十時許、日機二架、在空中及附近村落間盤旋、歷數小時、在一時許、擲彈十餘枚、鎭上及徐家角孫家宅等之民房、均略有損壞、惟力量甚微、故無大礙、傷鄕民二名、至天明五時、尙有日機飛行、昨日下午日機六架又至、但未擲彈、</p>
<p>滬西前晚十時許、有日飛機兩架、於黑夜飛往眞茹一帶、抛擲炸彈後、又至滬西北新涇·及周家橋·白利南路等處天空、盤旋兩匝、先在白利南路兆豐花園門前美軍兵營附近空地上投落一彈、幸未爆炸、後又在北新涇公安局所設之糞廠旁某西人花園內、亦投下一彈、當即爆發、炸毁玻璃花棚一大間、彈入泥土成一大穴、深約三尺、徑約四尺餘、又楊家橋顧家宅、被毁民屋二間、傷鄕人四名又抛下火球甚多、小陳家宅被燒民屋一間、</p>
<p>眞茹前晚（二十六）八時半敵戰鬥機一架、突飛至眞茹偵察、頻以電光照射、時附近田間伏有漢奸兩名、於敵機來時、燃放電光炮、（形如新年中兒童所放之月炮）高入雲霄、以爲標號、敵機見後、即抛擲炸彈、幸均落曠地、未有損失、至十時許、始飛往他處、漢奸兩名、即經總指揮部捕獲、均江北人、已於昨日在眞茹正法、又昨晨（二十七）三時許、又有敵機五六架、在眞茹附近飛翔偵察一週、至黎明時、始向吳淞方面飛去、</p>
<p>中興路紅十字會戰區救護隊第二班、由前方運傷兵之救護車、昨晨八時後開駛、經中興路道中忽來敵機三架、擲下一爆炸彈、距車僅四十碼、傷行人五、彈烟直衝車側幸護傷人員未曾受傷、受彈重傷之行人三、輕傷二、當由救護員扶登汽車、與忠勇與敵搏戰之傷兵八名、一併運送上海地方維持會第一傷兵醫院治療云、</p>
<p>浦東昨晨七時二十分、敵機三架、由公大紗廠內飛往浦東楊家橋·高橋至塘橋一帶、前後其擲炸彈十餘枚、有數枚爆裂炸燬楊姓草屋一間、並炸死路人一名、傷三人、旋經我軍開槍射、擊始行逸去、其死傷路人之姓名如下、王春大（男）傷臂、李諸氏（女）傷腦、褚阿毛（男）傷左腿、十六歲之兪姓小孩已死、</p>
<p>滬杭路昨日上午九時餘滬杭路艮山門站、又發現日機三架、在該處視察一週即去、又楓涇站亦見日機多架、翻飛一過、均未擲彈、因我後方軍警已嚴防敵機不敢久飛、至下午一時許、沿滬杭路綫、不見日機踪跡、</p>
<h3>浦東謠傳釋疑</h3>
<p>日人行動原可注目</p>
<p>如果屯兵自陷窮蹙</p>
<p>浦東雖與浦西僅一水之隔、爲其形勢關係、於此次戰事上尙無何等重大影響、以故得以安謐、邇因楊樹浦對岸之日商三井洋棧、業已打掃完竣、日軍將行屯兵、傳稱同時老白渡大阪棧同春福棧等、日方昨亦派人前往打掃以是浦東居民、不無恐慌、而張家浜日商三菱碼頭外浦中、泊有日商輪一艘、傳稱該輪內藏有日便衣隊若干、記者曾向當地負責者詢問則謂浦東沿浦日本廠棧、不止一家、而各國廠棧亦爲數不少、關於治安方面、我當地警團完全負責、外商因之頗爲信賴、本月二十三四五等日、西溝方面、確有少數日兵上岸視察、每次約十餘人、竟向附近居戶查詢、其起因爲隣近喜事人家、吹奏軍樂、致啓日軍驚疑、旋見並無軍事行動、隨即返去、我方對彼亦淡然置之、故見怪不怪、其怪自敗、至傳東溝地方設砲之說、尙非事實、我方亦由無軍之設備、地面安謐如常、高橋以北、雖因流彈關係居民徙避、惟詢諸高橋方面來人、云無軍事、至報載白龍港有日艦砲轟岸上平民、查無其事、所云敵機用機關槍向地上村農掃射、亦非事實、大約係飛機𢌞聲、爲村農誤聽、致有此謠傳耳、蓋浦東三面環水、就軍事上觀察、日軍不應前往致滋紛擾、而自陷於窮蹙、况一旦屯兵其間、勢必促地主以自衛之必要、緣是而有所接觸、日商在當地之財產、首當供其犧牲、設或殃及他國商民財產、日方又須負一損失之責也、</p>
<h3>日軍十四師團到滬</h3>
<p>昨到六千餘名</p>

<h3>滬領團將對日再抗議</h3>
<p>租界損失由日本負責</p>
<p>日文每日新聞云、昨日午前十時、美國領事館內、開駐滬各領事會議、僉謂日軍以公共租界爲根據地、砲擊中國軍、而中國吳巿長、則因租界當局、放任日軍砲擊、對於各種損失、决不負責、因此各國咸抱不安之念、昨日共同協議結果、决定再提出抗議、謂此交事變租界方面所受之損失、日本難辭其咎、應負賠償責任、微聞市政府方面、亦有同樣抗議、</p>

<h3>孫陳對外重要表示</h3>
<p>孫科·陳友仁、昨發表其對於美國國務卿史汀生致波拉函之感想一文、原文爲英文、茲譯如下、</p>
<p>該函爲美國遠東政策中之一重要文件、其最堪注意之點、厥爲確定九國公約與軍縮協定之關係、蓋美國曾願意放棄其建造戰艦之領袖地位、及不再增築其在甘姆及菲律濱之防禦工程、而以爲九國公約可資其保障也、十年前華府會議時、英美接受海軍限制、而致日本獨霸於中國及遠東海面、但英美對於海軍霸權之讓步、因以爲日本厠於現代强國之列、定能履行條約上之義務也、不料此次日本對中國之侵略、及其對於美國及國聯之意見、顯示挑戰態度、不特濫用其在華府會議時所取得之特權、直不啻自暴露其爲野蠻國家、至此、吾人可曉然於日本之所以悍然不顧國際公約與九國公約及非戰公約之故、現在除非英美聯合海軍力量、或可以戢暴日之兇燄、不然、世界實無戰獨一强國、能以武力强其尊重其在條約朿縛下之任何國際義務也、</p>

        <h1>1932.02.28</h1>
<h3>Reading Stinson's Letter to Borah ㈠ Bin</h3>
<p>Recently, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson sent a letter to Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He solemnly reaffirmed the U.S. government's consistent policy of the Open Door and Equal Opportunity and pointed out that Japan's actions since the Northeast Incident of September 18th last year have violated the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. In the current situation where the Shanghai battle is intensifying and the situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly tense, the attitude shown in this letter is of great importance to the international political situation and is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The trade relationship between the United States and China dates back to the mid-19th century. After the Sino-Japanese War, China was taken advantage of by the powers and gradually became subject to partition. U.S. Secretary of State John Hay, fearing that U.S. commerce would be affected, proposed to all countries in 1899 the principle that U.S. commerce should have equal opportunity with other countries. Great Britain was the first to agree, and other countries followed suit. This was the earliest establishment of the Open Door and Equal Opportunity policy by the Washington government. During the Boxer Rebellion, the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing. The U.S., deeply concerned that this principle would be undermined, notified all countries that they must protect the lives and property of U.S. citizens and maintain China's peace and security. In 1900, the Anglo-German Agreement was signed, and the U.S. also solemnly declared that there should be no neglect of equal commercial opportunities and China's territorial integrity. In 1915, Japan presented China with the unreasonable "Twenty-One Demands," which completely destroyed the Open Door policy. The U.S. protested severely, declaring that "the U.S. government cannot recognize any agreement that harms the treaty interests of the U.S. and its people in China, or harms China's political or territorial integrity, or harms the equal treatment of commerce and industry of all nations under the Open Door policy." This shows the importance that the U.S. government has always attached to the Open Door and Equal Opportunity policy.</p>
<p>In 1921, U.S. President Harding initiated the Washington Conference to seek lasting peace in the Far East. The discussion of the China issue at the conference was based on the principles of territorial sovereignty, integrity, equal opportunity, and the Open Door, which evolved into the Nine-Power Treaty. Thus, John Hay's Open Door policy of 1899 was further assured and became legally binding on the contracting countries. This policy is the fundamental principle of the Washington government on the Far Eastern question, and it has been followed consistently since John Hay.</p>
<p>However, this principle is most envied by Japan. Japan, as a powerful country in the Far East, is ambitious and dreams of realizing its "continental empire" every day. It knows that its "continental policy" is directly opposed to the U.S. Open Door policy, so it often regards the U.S. as a potential enemy, believing that a war between the U.S. and Japan in the Pacific is inevitable. The outbreak of the September 18th Incident last year directly damaged China's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Indirectly, it tore up the solemn and sacred Nine-Power Treaty and challenged the U.S. The evolution of the Northeast Incident led to the outbreak of the current Shanghai war. Japan's ambition is becoming increasingly apparent, and the U.S. is increasingly feeling threatened. It was long expected that the U.S. government could no longer sit idly by and watch the development of the situation in the Far East and its own increasingly difficult situation without speaking out.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>The enemy army awaits reinforcements and prepares for a major battle.</p>
<p>The enemy fleet bombards the Lion Grove.</p>
<p>Fires rage in Zhabei.</p>
<p>Harmless to our army, but it torments our people.</p>
<p>No major battles in Miaohang and Jiangwan.</p>
<p>Since the enemy forces launched a general offensive towards Miaohang, Jiangwan, etc., they have concentrated their firepower and fought for two days. They have been repeatedly defeated and their main forces are exhausted. While requesting aid from their government, they also sent planes to harass our various areas. Until yesterday, there were no fierce battles there, only sporadic gunfire and artillery fire, which was simply annoying. However, more than 6,000 men from their 14th Division arrived yesterday, and more are expected today. It is estimated that the enemy will launch a full-scale battle this morning after their reinforcements arrive. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Situation on the Wusong Front</h3>
<p>Enemy army bombards Lion Grove</p>
<p>Our army sinks smuggling boats</p>
<p>After suffering a major defeat in the smuggling attempt at Yunzaobang, the enemy army no longer dared to try easily to attack Wusong. In recent days, they concentrated their main forces on Jiangwan and Dachang. Initially, they engaged in infantry melee combat, but they were surrounded by our army and suffered heavy losses again. Therefore, they did not hesitate to use dozens of heavy artillery to bombard continuously day and night. However, due to the natural bravery of our army, the enemy achieved almost no effect, not only making no progress but also suffering repeated defeats. Enemy Commander Ueda Shigeru was in a difficult position and repeatedly telegraphed for reinforcements, hoping to reverse the decline. It is reported that yesterday, there were more than a dozen large Japanese warships outside Wusongkou, waiting for foreign merchant ships to enter the port so that they could use them as cover to drive straight in. The reinforcements they carried numbered about 6,000. Currently, there are about thirty enemy warships, and it is said that the enemy will change their strategy again and pay more attention to Wusong. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲The enemy will change their strategy again. According to reliable sources, the enemy army has already changed its strategy. The enemy troops in Jiangwan and Miaohang built semi-permanent trenches and artillery positions the day before yesterday, determined to use heavy artillery to bombard our army. At the same time, all the enemy troops were transferred to the area between Sitang River and Yunzaobang, attacking our army positions from Houjia Wood Bridge to Jijiabridge, aiming at Yangxing Town and Huangjiazhai, in order to cut off our connection between Songjiang and Shanghai. On the other hand, a large number of enemy warships attempted to invade our North and South Forts and Lion Grove Fort at Wusongkou, in order to restrain our forces. Therefore, the area around Houjia Wood Bridge and Jijiabridge has been fiercely contested since the morning before yesterday until yesterday afternoon, without any rest. The sound of artillery and machine guns was extremely clear in Wusong and Zhanghuabang. On the front from Yunzaobang to Hei Bridge, the enemy and our armies remained separated by the river, and the battle line has not changed since the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>Enemy warships bomb Lion Grove. At 7:30 yesterday morning, more than 20 enemy warships concentrated on the river surface between Liuhe and Baoshan. At the same time, seven enemy planes concentrated their artillery fire and bombed our Lion Grove Fort. Our army responded calmly and fired back from time to time. Until 11:20, the enemy planes flew away, but the bombardment continued, covering the enemy troops, attempting to land at Paotai Bay. When they reached a suitable location, they stopped the bombardment. At this time, our army used machine guns and mortars to fire at the enemy, and many hits were scored. The enemy warships also opened fire and attacked fiercely. The mixed battle continued until about 2:00 in the afternoon and had not yet stopped. Most of the bombs dropped were heavy bombs weighing more than 250 pounds, but our fortifications were extremely well-laid out, and most of the enemy bombs sank into the silt and lost their explosive power.</p>
<p>The enemy army is busy transporting. Yesterday, an enemy warship traveled back and forth from outside the port to Yunzaobang, firing artillery. It only retreated outside the port at about 11:00. Subsequently, enemy planes also went west along Yunzaobang. According to observations of the situation in Zhanghuabang yesterday, the enemy troops there were still very weak, with only about 700 or 800 men. They were hiding in groups of two or three among the grave hills in various places. Four enemy armored vehicles were parked on Jungong Road between the Zhanghuabang Naval Hospital and the Railway Primary School. At about 10:00 yesterday morning, six enemy trucks, fully loaded with ammunition and military supplies, drove from Yangshupu to Zhanghuabang and unloaded them. Then, a locomotive pulled a coal car to transport the ammunition to the front.</p>
<p>Three enemy boats sunk. At about 10:00 yesterday morning, more than 200 soldiers from the Zhanghuabang Grain and Rice Wharf, etc., boarded four armored barges and, using Zhou Tang as cover, sailed along the pond to the mouth of Yunzaobang, hoping to smuggle across. They were discovered by the garrison troops of our Outer Marl Road, who used land-based artillery to bombard the enemy boats. Unable to retreat, three boats were sunk on the spot, and about 150 enemy soldiers were drowned. The last one quickly turned its rudder, avoided the pond, and fled quickly. In this battle, only about 50 enemy soldiers survived, and our side did not lose a single soldier.</p>
<p>Enemy arson in Yunzaobang. At about 8:00 yesterday morning, when reporters went to Dachang to inspect, they saw black flames soaring to the northeast. After carefully identifying the direction, they learned that it was near Wusong. After many inquiries, they learned that after the disastrous defeat, the enemy, extremely bored, secretly dispatched many Han Chinese plainclothes teams disguised as civilians to smuggle across Yunzaobang and sneak into various villages to commit arson. As a result, the residents who had already been robbed were subjected to arson. From last night to this morning, it has not stopped. In addition, the wind god helped, and no one came to the rescue, so the fire spread even more fiercely. From higher places in this port, you can see the black smoke soaring into the sky from afar. At the time of drafting, the fire was spreading westward, and Jiuruli was already in danger. The brutal behavior of the Japanese soldiers is truly that of demons on earth. The Gongxing Road near Tiantong'an Road caught fire in the morning and did not extinguish all day. Until 12:00 at night, the fire was still shining brightly, and the black smoke was filled. The fire was no less than that on Zhongxing Road. The losses in both places are countless.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Gunfire and Flames</h3>
<p>Enemy sneak attacks are repelled.</p>
<p>Major fires on Zhongxing and Gongxing Roads.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese army in Zhabei used artillery and planes from morning to night to bombard Tiantong'an Road, Zhongxing Road, Qingyun Road, Gongxing Road, etc., resulting in several fires that did not go out all day. Starting at 7:00 p.m., the Japanese army in the Tiantong'an Qiujiang Road area used a small number of soldiers to launch sneak attacks on our army from time to time, but they were all repelled by our machine guns. The enemy planes were shot down by our army at about 4:00 p.m. and fled. The artillery bombardment subsided at about 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Enemy sneak attacks are repelled at night. Yesterday afternoon at about 7:00, after the artillery bombardment, the Japanese army dispatched a small number of infantry, no more than 30 or 40 men, to launch sneak attacks on our defensive line on Qiujiang Road and Tiantong'an Road. Our army lay in ambush in the trenches, remaining silent. The Japanese army thought that our army had been forced back by their artillery fire, so they continued to grope forward. When they were about a hundred meters away from our army's position, our machine guns suddenly opened fire, and all those in front of them were annihilated. After a while, they came again and fled again, like this three or four times. Later, the Japanese army saw that there was no opportunity to take advantage of, so they stopped advancing, but still used rifles to shoot from a distance from time to time, and our army also returned fire. This is the origin of the sporadic gunfire and fragmented machine gun fire last night.</p>
<p>Major fire on Zhongxing Road all day. Since the day before yesterday, because of the infantry contact, the Japanese army not only failed to cross our red line but also resulted in the loss of soldiers and generals, so they changed to using artillery bombardment and plane bombing. However, the result still failed to harm us in the slightest. Yesterday was the second day that the enemy army used this tactic. Starting at 5:00 a.m., they used artillery to bombard Tiantong'an and Zhabei. At the same time, three Japanese planes were circling in the sky over Zhabei and dropping bombs. Zhongxingli on Zhongxing Road first took a hit from an enemy plane's bomb at 5:00 a.m. yesterday morning, followed by a sulfur bomb, which immediately caught fire. At first, it only spread in the neighborhood, but then, due to the strong wind, it gradually spread to the neighboring houses. At the same time, enemy artillery shells flew and exploded on the ground, further fueling the fire. By noon, the houses opposite Yu on Zhongxing Road had been completely burned down. Before long, Dingyuanli was also affected. In the evening, it had burned to more than half, and the fire was still increasing and not decreasing. Looking from a distance, the sky was completely red, and it was not known where it would end. At the time of drafting, the fire was spreading westward, and Jiuruli was already in danger. The cruel behavior of the Japanese soldiers is truly that of demons on earth. Gongxing Road near Tiantong'an Road caught fire in the morning and did not extinguish all day. Until 12:00 at night, the fire was still shining brightly, and the black smoke was filled. The fire was no less than that on Zhongxing Road. The losses in both places are countless.</p>
<h3>Miaohang and Jiangwan are quiet</h3>
<p>Sporadic gunfire, no major battles</p>
<p>Large numbers of enemy corpses transported to Yangshupu</p>
<p>The fighting between Miaohang and Jiangwan has been quiet since the enemy's general offensive failed the day before yesterday. The enemy took advantage of planes and artillery to threaten us from time to time, and at the same time, small units harassed our lines. From yesterday morning until midnight, the entire line was quiet, and there was no fierce fighting. Yesterday afternoon, after 4:00, the sound of artillery fire resumed in the Jiangwan area, but it was very sparse. Our army did not return fire because the enemy was simply wasting bullets.</p>
<p>Enemy corpses strewn along the road. The entire town of Dachang was hit by three large bombs dropped by Japanese planes the day before yesterday, which exploded immediately. Seven-tenths of the entire town's houses were destroyed and have become a burnt wasteland. Fortunately, the people have all fled and are temporarily hiding in nearby villages. In Miaohang, Zhao Dianzhai, Zhuweidun, Mengjiazai, and Dashenzhai the day before yesterday, the Japanese army was greatly defeated. Dead bodies piled up in the fields along the road, and blood flowed into ditches. Except for the corpses outside our army's firing line, the Japanese army dragged the bodies near the railway in the afternoon and evening of yesterday and loaded them into large trucks, transporting them to Yangshupu and the Gongda Yarn Factory. There were a total of forty-eight trucks, estimated to be more than three thousand people. Bloodstains were everywhere along the way, and even those with broken limbs and still breathing were taken away together.</p>

<p>Enemy Headquarters moved. According to reliable information, the Japanese Army Headquarters moved again yesterday into a certain factory on Zhapu Road. The Gongda Yarn Factory is dedicated to storing large quantities of military supplies. More than 200 Jiangbei people previously employed are now serving as guides on the front lines, each receiving ten yuan in silver every day.</p>
<h3>Enemy planes drop bombs day and night</h3>
<p>Assisting the enemy army's atrocities.</p>
<p>Injuring civilians in the surrounding villages.</p>
<p>Enemy planes have been dropping bombs indiscriminately for days, injuring civilians. This has generally been more frequent during the day. Starting at 9:00 the night before last, more than ten Japanese planes suddenly took advantage of the fact that our people were asleep and flew to the Zhabei Pengpu Zhenru area, dropping more than fifty bombs and incendiary bombs, burning down civilian houses, and only left at dawn. Yesterday morning, there were also multiple Japanese planes dropping bombs everywhere. The following is a summary of the situation:</p>
<p>Zhabei. At about 9:00 the night before last, five Japanese planes flew to the area around Datong Road and Gonghexin Road in Zhabei. The residents woke up in surprise from their dreams and saw five Japanese planes that looked like red lights. The lights were very strong, and the plane bodies could be seen roughly. Two planes flew west, and three planes circled in the air, dropping three bombs on the Datong Road Sun Temple, destroying a temple and a civilian house, and injuring one poor civilian. They only left at dawn.</p>
<p>Pengpu. Pengpu is adjacent to Zhabei, so Japanese planes often go there for reconnaissance. At about 10:00 the night before last, two Japanese planes circled in the air and in the surrounding villages for several hours. At about 1:00, they dropped more than ten bombs. The civilian houses in the town and Xujiajiao Sunjiazai, etc., were slightly damaged, but the damage was very small, so there was no major problem, injuring two villagers. Until 5:00 at dawn, there were still Japanese planes flying. Yesterday afternoon, six Japanese planes came again, but they did not drop bombs.</p>
<p>Western Shanghai. At about 10:00 the night before last, two Japanese planes flew to the Zhenru area in the dark and dropped bombs. Then, they went to the sky over Xinxing, Zhoujiaqiao, and Route Tenant de la Tour in northwestern Shanghai and circled twice. First, they dropped a bomb on the open space near the American military barracks in front of the Zhao Feng Garden on Route Tenant de la Tour, but fortunately it did not explode. Later, they also dropped a bomb in a Westerner's garden next to the manure factory set up by the Public Security Bureau in Beixinxing, which exploded immediately, destroying a large glass greenhouse, and the bomb entered the soil to form a large hole, about three feet deep and more than four feet in diameter. In addition, two civilian houses in Gujiazai, Yangjiaqiao, were destroyed, and four villagers were injured. Many fireballs were also dropped, and one civilian house in Xiaochenjiazai was burned down.</p>
<p>Zhenru. At 8:30 the night before last (26th), an enemy fighter plane suddenly flew to Zhenru for reconnaissance and frequently illuminated the area with electric light. At that time, two Chinese traitors were lurking in the fields nearby. When the enemy plane came, they lit electric light cannons (shaped like the moon cannons set off by children during the New Year), which soared into the clouds, as a signal. After the enemy plane saw it, it dropped bombs, but fortunately they all landed in open areas and there were no losses. It only flew to other places at about 10:00. The two Chinese traitors were captured by the General Headquarters and were executed in Zhenru yesterday. Also, yesterday morning (27th) at about 3:00, five or six enemy planes flew around Zhenru for reconnaissance for a week before flying towards Wusong at dawn.</p>
<p>Zhongxing Road. The Second Team of the Red Cross War Zone Rescue Team was transporting wounded soldiers from the front. After 8:00 yesterday morning, as they drove along Zhongxing Road, three enemy planes suddenly came and dropped an explosive bomb, only forty yards away from the car, injuring five pedestrians. The smoke from the bomb went straight to the side of the car, but fortunately the rescue personnel were not injured. Three pedestrians were seriously injured by the bomb, and two were slightly injured. The rescue workers helped them board the car and transported them together with eight wounded soldiers who were bravely fighting the enemy to the First Wounded Soldier Hospital of the Shanghai Local Maintenance Association for treatment.</p>
<p>Pudong. At 7:20 yesterday morning, three enemy planes flew from the Gongda Yarn Factory to the Yangjiaqiao, Gaoqiao, and Tangqiao areas of Pudong, dropping more than a dozen bombs one after another. Several bombs exploded, destroying a thatched house of the Yang family, killing a passerby, and injuring three people. Then, our army fired shots to repel them. The names of the dead and injured passersby are as follows: Wang Chunda (male) injured arm, Li Zhushi (female) injured head, Chu Amao (male) injured left leg, 16-year-old Yu surname child is dead.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. Yesterday morning, at 9:00, three Japanese planes were again found at the Genshanmen Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. They inspected the area for a week and then left. Also, many Japanese planes were seen flying over Fengjing Station, but they did not drop bombs. Because our rear military police had strictly guarded against enemy planes, they did not dare to fly for long. By 1:00 in the afternoon, there were no traces of Japanese planes along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road line.</p>
<h3>Clarification of Rumors in Pudong</h3>
<p>Japanese actions can be closely watched.</p>
<p>If they garrison troops, they will fall into poverty.</p>
<p>Although Pudong is only separated from Puxi by a river, due to its terrain, it has not had any major impact on this war and has been able to remain peaceful. Recently, the Mitsui Foreign Company on the opposite bank of Yangshupu has been cleaned up, and the Japanese army will garrison troops there. It is rumored that at the same time, the Japanese side also sent people to clean up the Laobaidu Osaka Wharf and the Tongchunfu Wharf. Therefore, the residents of Pudong are worried. A Japanese merchant ship is docked outside the Mitsubishi Wharf in Zhangjiabang Waipucun. It is rumored that the ship contains a number of Japanese plainclothes teams. The reporter inquired about this with the person in charge of the area, who said that there is more than one Japanese factory and wharf along the Pudong coast, and there are also a considerable number of factories and wharves of other countries. Our local police force is fully responsible for security matters, which the foreign merchants trust very much. On the 23rd, 24th, and 25th of this month, a small number of Japanese soldiers did come ashore to inspect in Xigou, about ten people each time. They even inquired with nearby residents. The reason for this was that a neighboring family was celebrating a happy event and playing military music, which caused the Japanese army to be alarmed. When they saw that there was no military action, they returned. Our side also treated them indifferently, so they were not surprised by it, and the strange thing disappeared. As for the saying that there are cannons set up in Donggou, it is not true. Our side also has no military equipment, and the ground is as peaceful as ever. Although residents have moved away from north of Gaoqiao due to stray bullets, those who came from Gaoqiao said that there were no soldiers. As for the report that Japanese warships bombarded civilians on the shore at Bailonggang, this has not been verified. What they call enemy planes using machine guns to sweep the farmers on the ground is also not true. It is probably the sound of the plane flying that was mistaken by the farmers, resulting in this rumor. Pudong is surrounded by water on three sides. From a military point of view, the Japanese army should not go there and cause trouble, and trap themselves in poverty. Moreover, if they garrison troops there, it will inevitably prompt the landlords to defend themselves. If there is contact, the property of Japanese merchants in the area will be sacrificed first. If the property of merchants from other countries is affected, the Japanese side will have to bear the responsibility for the loss.</p>
<h3>The Japanese 14th Division arrives in Shanghai.</h3>
<p>More than 6,000 arrived yesterday.</p>
<p>The entire division can arrive today.</p>
<p>It has been exactly one month since the Japanese troops have been fighting in Shanghai until today. During these thirty-one days, the Japanese army initially used 6,200 naval marines to fight. Later, they transferred the 26th Brigade, which suffered repeated defeats after arriving in Shanghai. Then, they transferred the 9th Division to Shanghai, which launched a general offensive against us on the 20th of this month. After four days of fighting, they were defeated again by our army. The Japanese army then sent the 11th Division, which arrived in Shanghai in succession from the 24th and fought in Miaohang and other places, where they were almost completely wiped out. Now, they have added the 14th Division to Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Three thousand arrived in the morning. The reinforcements sent by Japan, the 14th Division, were loaded onto large warships yesterday morning and arrived outside Wusongkou, stopping in the waters around Sanjiashui Shitousha and waiting to be dispatched. At 6:10 and 10:10 yesterday morning, the 30th torpedo boat team loaded 3,000 and 2,000 Japanese soldiers to disembark at Zhanghuabang. The rest disembarked at the Huangpu Wharf in Yangshupu. These disembarking soldiers have been sent to the front line to fight. Plainclothes soldiers arrive later. At 2:05 p.m., a Japanese transport ship carrying more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers, most of whom were plainclothes teams, needed to change into military uniforms after arriving in Shanghai before being assigned to the teams. After the transport ship entered the port, it berthed in the Zhanghuabang area and disembarked in batches. The various clothes were different, shaped to be a collection from everywhere.</p>
<p>Shanghai Maru arrives. The Japanese postal ship Shanghai Maru also carried some soldiers of the 14th Division yesterday, totaling more than 500. It entered the port at 2:30 p.m. and berthed at the Mitsubishi Wharf. The soldiers disembarked in three batches, each time with more than 140 people, and were taken to Hongkou by truck. All of them were unloaded by night. The ship also transported more than a hundred boxes of artillery and weapons.</p>
<p>Two batches arrive in the evening. At 6:30 in the evening, another Japanese gunboat sailed in from outside Wusongkou, also carrying a batch of Japanese soldiers, numbering nearly a thousand. The landing took place late at night. Also, the Changyang Maru of the Japanese Shipping Company sailed out of Shanghai yesterday morning and sailed to Songkou to load Japanese soldiers. It entered the port at 6:00 in the evening and only arrived at the Huangpu River at 7:30. Therefore, the boarding of these two batches of Japanese soldiers all took place at night.</p>
<p>The entire division arrives today. It is reported that the total number of soldiers in the 14th Division is also 16,000 to 17,000. In addition to the 6,000 or so who arrived yesterday morning and afternoon, there are still about 10,000 in the warships outside Wusongkou, who are scheduled to be loaded in batches today to participate in the battle.</p>
<p>In addition, at 10:00 yesterday morning, two enemy destroyers sailed to the Huangpu Wharf, and another one arrived at 11:00, unloading five trucks of ammunition and four trucks of artillery shells and transporting them to Jungong Road. After the ammunition and ordnance were unloaded, another one sailed directly to the Xinkai River and berthed.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Central Committee members staying in Shanghai again urge Zhang to send troops</h3>
<p>Only hand-to-hand combat...no need to prepare.</p>
<p>The Chinese Central Committee members staying in Shanghai, Sun Ke, etc., had previously telegraphed Zhang Xueliang in Beiping, urging him to send troops immediately to recover the lost land. Zhang replied yesterday by telegram, ordering his subordinates to prepare. The Central Committee members stationed in Shanghai held their seventh meeting at 10:00 yesterday morning and decided to telegraph Zhang again, urging him to resolve to engage in hand-to-hand combat, saying that there was no need for preparation. The original telegram said: "To Director Zhang Hanqing in Beiping, Greetings. We have received your secret telegram. The Shanghai battle is becoming more and more urgent. The enemy is attacking us with all their strength. The survival of the country is at stake. Hesitation and looking back will inevitably lead to regret that cannot be remedied. It has been more than five months since the September 18th Incident. The enemy has entered the house. Only hand-to-hand combat can be done. How can there still be time for preparation? Please make a decision quickly and lead the entire army straight to the East Province to make up for your mistakes and seek merit. Everything depends on this move. We urge you again by telegram. Please consider it carefully. The Central Committee members stationed in Shanghai, deeply."</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Consular Body will protest to Japan again.</h3>
<p>Japan is responsible for the losses in the concession.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, a meeting of consuls stationed in Shanghai was held at the U.S. Consulate yesterday morning. All the consuls said that the Japanese army was using the Public Concession as a base to bombard the Chinese army, and Mayor Wu of Shanghai said that the concession authorities were allowing the Japanese army to bombard, and would not be responsible for any losses. Therefore, all countries felt uneasy. As a result of the joint discussion yesterday, it was decided to file another protest, saying that Japan could not shirk its responsibility for the losses suffered by the concession during this incident and should be held liable for compensation. It is faintly heard that the municipal government also has the same protest.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Protecting Overseas Chinese End Up Harming Them</h3>
<p>15,000 Japanese Nationals Have Returned Home</p>
<p>The "Da Mei Evening News" reports that, since the night of January 28th until today, a total of 15,000 Japanese nationals in China have returned home. About 11,000 of them were from Shanghai alone. Therefore, the Japanese civilians residing in Shanghai have decreased by nearly half in less than a month. This seems to be a unique way of expressing gratitude for Japan's military self-defense. If the continuous flow of returning nationals were British, American, French, and Italian civilians, while the Japanese remained peacefully here, it would at least present a healthy appearance. It would show that the Japanese troops, who rely on combat to protect the concessions, can avoid being attacked by the Chinese army. However, both our military and civilians are now living peacefully in the concessions, passively watching armed Japanese people shed blood in combat, while unarmed Japanese people take their families home. If this is the result of protection and self-defense, and it causes the Japanese overseas Chinese to lose their livelihoods, their safety, and even their place to live in the protected areas, we firmly believe that these returning Japanese overseas Chinese will at least feel that less aggressive protection would bring more enjoyment and happiness to the masses. This newspaper shares the same sentiment.</p>
<h3>Trade Associations Wire Chen Jitang Requesting Troops to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai cotton cloth industry, mercerized cotton yarn industry, rice trading industry, flying-flower industry, brick and ash industry, north-south goods exchange industry, sugar industry, coal industry, transport and sales lime industry, lumber industry, fur industry, ginseng and bird's nest industry, Chinese woollen fabric factory industry, southern goods industry, and other trade associations have been wiring Commander Chen Jitang of Guangzhou for days, requesting him to immediately send troops to Shanghai to join the resistance against Japan. The original telegram is recorded below: "General Chen Bonan of Guangzhou, with respect. At this time of national crisis, the whole country should rise up to resist Japan. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the 19th Route Army has taken the lead, and frequent victories have been reported, greatly thwarting the enemy's advance. However, the violent Japanese reinforcements are continuously encroaching upon Shanghai, and the situation is tense. Our army's hopes for reinforcements are urgent and cannot be delayed. We have always admired the soldiers of your army who have embraced the ambition to be pioneers and the determination to die for the country, but most of them are still in Quanzhou, and we have not heard of any being transferred to participate in the Shanghai war, which is truly regrettable. We believe that this war concerns the survival of the entire nation, and all those in command of troops should strive to volunteer, sweep away the demonic forces, avenge the humiliation of the Sino-Japanese War, and promote the prestige of the country. Therefore, we dare to wire you, requesting you to quickly transfer elite troops to Shanghai to jointly fight the enemy. The success or failure of resisting Japan depends on this one move. We implore you to consider this carefully." The Shanghai cotton cloth industry, mercerized cotton yarn industry, rice trading industry, flying-flower industry, brick and ash industry...</p>

<h3>Important Statements from Sun and Chen to the Outside World</h3>
<p>Sun Ke and Chen Youren yesterday issued their thoughts on the letter from United States Secretary of State Stimson to Poland. The original text was in English, and is now translated as follows:</p>
<p>"This letter is an important document in the United States' Far East policy. Its most noteworthy point is its confirmation of the relationship between the Nine-Power Treaty and the arms reduction agreement. The United States was willing to give up its leading position in building battleships and to no longer increase its defensive works in Guam and the Philippines, believing that the Nine-Power Treaty could guarantee its security. Ten years ago, at the Washington Conference, Britain and the United States accepted naval limitations, which led to Japan's domination in China and the Far Eastern waters. However, Britain and the United States made concessions on naval hegemony because they believed that Japan, as a modern power, would fulfill its treaty obligations. Unexpectedly, Japan's aggression against China and its attitude towards the United States and the League of Nations show a challenging attitude. It not only abuses the privileges it obtained at the Washington Conference, but also exposes itself as a barbaric country. Now, we can understand why Japan brazenly disregards international conventions, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Now, unless Britain and the United States unite their naval forces, they may be able to curb the fierce flames of violent Japan. Otherwise, there is really no single strong country in the world that can use force to compel it to respect any international obligations under treaty constraints."</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Association for the Fostering of the Bereaved Families of Soldiers Defending the Nation Yesterday</h3>

<p>More Than Ten Thousand Yuan Raised On-site for the Foundation</p>
<p>The Association for the Fostering of the Bereaved Families of Soldiers Defending the Nation held its inaugural meeting at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road in this city yesterday. More than forty people attended, chaired by Xu Shiying. First, they observed three minutes of silence to mourn the soldiers who died defending the nation. Then, they immediately raised funds for the foundation, elected a provisional executive committee, and appointed members to review the association's constitution. The details are recorded below. Appointment of the Constitution Review Committee: Jiang Yiping, Gao Yihan, Pan Xulun, Chen Aishi, Weng Ziguang, He Chongjie, Yao Wugang,</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Huang Bodu, and Tan Yigong were appointed as members of the Constitution Review Committee. It was also specified that Jiang Yiping should convene the meeting, which would be held at 2 PM on March 1st to review the constitution.</p>
<p>Provisional Executive Committee: Fifteen provisional executive committee members were publicly elected. The list is as follows: Zhu Ziqiao, Xu Jingshi, Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Chen Aishi, Wu Zhihao, Ye Huijun, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, Wen Lanting, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Guan Yunnong, and Jiang Yiping.</p>
<p>Fundraising: Ye Huijun pledged to donate 10,000 yuan to the foundation, and the Chaozhou Association pledged to donate 2,000 yuan. It was also stipulated that the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the He Feng Bank, the China-South Bank, and the Guangdong Bank would be the collection agencies. Furthermore, it was resolved: (1) to invite various hometown associations to join as sponsors; (2) to consider Yu Daxiong's letter, requesting that the American soldier, Tok, who participated in the war and died, be commemorated in accordance with the procedures for fallen soldiers. After discussing the various proposals, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Lawyers Association Asks Zhang Xueliang to Supervise the Troops and Expel the Invaders</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association recently wired the National Government in Luoyang, stating: "To the National Government in Luoyang, with respect. Since the Xinhai Revolution, national opinion has almost always been consistent, and national policy has been determined accordingly. And such national opinion, its opportunity arises from below, not manipulated from above, such as the overthrow of Hongxian, the suppression of the restoration, and the Northern Expedition in the thirteenth year. Now, in resisting Japan, a consistent national opinion has arisen again. This matter concerns resistance to aggression, and is far above internal strife. The opportunity arises from below, and the momentum is especially powerful, widespread, and unstoppable. The facts are so, and cannot be slandered. When the disaster first arose, the government proposed a policy of non-resistance to the world, and therefore there was Zhang Xueliang of Liaoning who outwardly bore the name, while the central government was able to hide itself in indecision. As for the battle of Shanghai, it finally reached a point where seven heads had to be seen. Airplanes were repeatedly blocked, reinforcements were slow to arrive, the people's righteous indignation grew higher by the day, and the prestige of the Party government fell further. Alas, alas! Human emotions are often stimulated, and something is forgotten. In the past, Cao Cao, when governing his army, still knew to order that after the chaos, all past events should not be discussed. Now, the people are eager to resist foreign aggression, and all of your mistakes and moral failures have not yet been discussed. If you neglect public opinion and stubbornly adhere to your own views, regarding past horizontal and vertical maneuvers and watching from the sidelines as a successful strategy, and do not change your plans dramatically, knowing that you are fooling the people, acting like the one who sold orchids, then you will be cutting yourselves off from the National Government, and how will you repay your failures in the future? This is something that we cannot bear to say. Otherwise, the national policy is war, and there should be no second word other than this. Considering the events of today, the three northeastern provinces are the main issue, and Shanghai is secondary. The loyalty and bravery of the 19th Route Army are enough to break metal and stone and make ghosts and gods weep. However, fighting in Shanghai but not fighting outside the passes is exactly the opposite of blocking the source by pulling trees. Zhang Xueliang previously received the order from the central government, and retreated without a fight, losing thousands of miles of territory. Now, he should be able to receive the order from the central government again, turn to fight, advance to recover the invaded land. The one who tied the bell should untie it; this is a fundamental principle. The public opinion has been discussing Zhang as war supervisor, it's very loud and dusty. Envoys of weeping, met on the road. We, in their negative side, say, Zhang Xueliang lost his army and his land, all of his people, are the central government's people. From its righteousness, great harm has not yet taken shape, the power of the military action is a temporary expedient. An urgent message is sent to Wanping, and then the sword will reach Juyi. Moreover, the enemy troops are now pressing against Shanghai with a desperate stance. The Liaoning army continues to move south. What was previously said to be cutting off the right arm of the Xiongnu, we are taking advantage of the situation to attack it, which is still a superior strategy of response. Based on the above, we urgently express our words. Order Zhang Xueliang, the Pacification Director of Beiping, to immediately supervise the troops and rush to suppress the Eastern bandits. The national destiny is in danger, and public opinion is to be feared. In the past, all were dead, but today we begin to live. We implore you to truly consider the benefits. The Shanghai Lawyers Association bows in repentance."</p>
<h3>Three Groups from China, Korea, and Taiwan Advise Japanese Soldiers to Save Themselves</h3>
<p>Yesterday, someone picked up a Japanese leaflet dropped from an airplane, translated as follows: "Three major groups of Chinese, Korean, and Taiwanese in Shanghai advise Japanese soldiers to mutiny and save themselves. We, representing four million people from China, Korea, and Taiwan in Shanghai, advise the Japanese soldiers who are pointlessly sacrificing their precious lives to invade Shanghai. Soldiers, you must know that the imperialism and militarism of Japan are of no benefit to you, the Japanese people, and have aroused opposition from all countries in the world. Look at the invasion of Shanghai for a month, a hundred battles, a hundred defeats, the more than 60,000 soldiers who have come, almost none have returned alive. Your parents, wives, and children are all crying for you. Soldiers, the Chinese nation is not to be easily offended. We hope that you will quickly rise up and save yourselves, recognize your enemies, turn your guns against them, overthrow the imperial system, overthrow the warlords, and realize a democratic country, liberate the oppressed Korean and Taiwanese nations, in order to unite the East Asian nations of the same race and culture, coexist and prosper, and maintain world peace. United Association of National Salvation Groups in Shanghai, United Association of Korean Groups in Shanghai, Association of Taiwanese Remnants in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Two Villagers from Jiangwan Survive a Perilous Situation</h3>
<p>Relating the Atrocities of Japanese Troops Killing Innocent People</p>
<p>The suffering of the villagers who were brutally poisoned by the Japanese troops who attacked Jiangwan is beyond description. Western newspapers expose the atrocities of the Japanese troops every day. Now there are villagers Wang Hairu and Yuan Xiaojin, who live in Xiaozhoujiazhai in Jiangwan. Yesterday, they escaped after repeated difficulties and met with reporters, recounting the atrocities of the Japanese troops who killed people and set fires. Wang and Yuan are both honest</p>
<p>farmers, each carrying a vegetable basket, and escaping through Hongzhen and other places, they were fortunate to survive the dangerous situation. The number of others who did not escape and were killed by the violent soldiers is unknown. The two gentlemen Wang and Yuan are recorded, recounting their eyewitness accounts of the cruel behavior of the Japanese troops as follows: When the Japanese troops attacked Jiangwan fiercely but failed to take it, they used airplanes to drop bombs and bombard the towns and villages. The entire town of Jiangwan has now been bombed into a scorched earth. Xiaozhoujiazhai, Shenjiazhai, Xujiacun and other villages near Jiangwan Town were spared. The Japanese troops then invaded from the northeast of Jiangwan Town, and met with fleeing villagers, killing all men, women, old and young, without asking. Those who were slightly fortunate were captured and used as hard labor. Wang and Yuan, who have lived in Xiaozhoujiazhai for generations, witnessed the killing of more than thirty villagers in the village when they had not escaped, not to mention other villages. Wang's wife, Ji Xueling, his three-year-old son, Gengsheng, and his apprentice, Yuan Jinrong, fourteen years old, all witnessed them being shot and killed by Japanese troops in the village. Furthermore, Li Guixiang and his wife, and their four-year-old son, Sigeng, also died in the village. Zhou Guisheng, also from the village, was fortunate enough to escape, but his old mother, his brother's wife, and his two nephews, aged four and eight, all died. The Japanese troops have not yet dared to attack Jiangwan Town. The Xitata Bridge in the western market of the town has now been destroyed. The Chinese and Japanese armies are now separated by the river at the Xitata Bridge, and guarding it. The Japanese troops did not dare to cross</p>
<p>the line. The Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties, and more than ten trucks, or at least six or seven trucks, were carrying corpses to the Yangshupu area every day. Our army suffered very few casualties. Only one corpse of our army was seen in the Jiangwan area.</p>

<h3>A Risky Inspection Tour of Hongkou</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Have Dug Trenches Everywhere</p>
<p>Pockmarked by Shells Around Hongkou Vegetable Market</p>
<p>Pedestrians Have Disappeared, Turning into a Dead Market</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that a reporter ventured out yesterday morning to inspect the Hongkou area. Starting from Sichuan Road Bridge, via Tiantong Road,</p>
<p>they were immediately searched by Japanese troops for about two minutes. A plainclothes team from Japan asked the reporter what province they were from. They replied that they were from Zhejiang, and were then</p>
<p>allowed to pass. Heading north to Haining Road, they were searched again, even more strictly than the first time. They even wanted the reporter to take off their clothes to inspect them. Because they did not find any suspicious objects, they were still allowed to pass. When they tried to move forward, they were stopped. Turning east, they saw the Hongkou Hotel. In addition to the Japanese residents, there was a small cannon and a machine gun on the north-facing window on the second floor. Two trenches were dug between Zhaopu Road and Haining Road. Crossing Wusong Road to Sikaizi Road, there were a total of four trenches. Trying to move forward again, they were stopped. Therefore, they turned back and headed south along Wusong Road to the triangular vegetable market. On the way, they only encountered two Chinese people. Apart from the soldiers, no Japanese people were seen. The lights in the Japanese Club on Peng Road were all lit up, and it seemed that a large number of Japanese people were working inside, and were very busy. Four Japanese soldiers and two Japanese policemen were standing at the entrance of the Hongkou Police Station. The reporter stayed at the south end of the vegetable market for about five minutes, and saw that several market houses on both sides were destroyed by artillery fire. There was a shell-shaped spot on the north side of the vegetable market. As they were watching, the Japanese police stepped forward and drove the reporter south. They returned via Tiantong Road and across Zhaopu Road.</p>
<h3>British Envoy Lamb Arrives in Beijing</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that the British envoy, Lampson, is scheduled to go to Beijing today (27th) to discuss important matters with the Chinese government. He will complete the official business in a day or two and will return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi Resumes His Position and Comes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi recently resigned from all his positions to the Dining Department and left Shanghai to return to Beijing. Foreign Minister Luo repeatedly tried to persuade him to stay. Guo, considering the national crisis and the seriousness of the situation in Shanghai, immediately withdrew his resignation and came to Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3>News of Appreciation</h3>
<p>The Zhongxing Bank's Appreciation Money: The staff of the Xiamen branch of Zhongxing Bank jointly donated 1,500 yuan in national currency yesterday, which was remitted and delivered to Military Commander Cai Tingkai for the purpose of appreciating the soldiers at the front. After the Shanghai branch received it, it was forwarded to the office of the 19th Route Army. Additionally, the Zhongxing Bank received remittances yesterday from the Philippine head office. The following is a list of donations from various national salvation associations in the Philippines to Military Commander Cai Tingkai: Over 1,000 yuan from Santa Cruz, Marinduque; 1,000 yuan from Gumaca; 1,000 yuan from Lumban, Tayabas Province; and over 800 yuan from Balingasag, Misamis Oriental.</p>
<p>The Shandong Qinghe Engineering Bureau Raises Funds to Commend the Troops: The Municipal Government received a telegram yesterday from the Shandong Qinghe Engineering Bureau, which read: "To the respected comrades of the entire anti-Japanese army through the Shanghai Municipal Government. We share the indignation at the Japanese invaders and deeply admire the army's defense. We respectfully offer a small amount of funds to express our appreciation. In addition to the remittance, we send this telegram to express our sincerity and look forward to your great achievements. Sincerely, all staff of the Shandong Qinghe Engineering Bureau."</p>
<p>Continued News of Donations from Postal Workers: In addition to jointly raising 2,113.25 yuan, 221 small silver coins, and 100 copper coins with the Postal Workers' Union to provide for the 19th Route Army, which was delivered to the Shanghai Office of the 19th Route Army, the local Postal Workers' Association also sent all of the remaining funds under its custody from the national salvation fund, amounting to 1,183 yuan and change, to the 19th Route Army. In addition, they forwarded many donations from postal workers in various locations, including 1,000 yuan from Peiping, 800 yuan from Yichang, 324 yuan from Shashi, 300 yuan from Guangdong, and 500 burlap sacks from Hangzhou. Huang Dingsan, a letter carrier in the Yichang Bureau, donated 10 yuan despite his meager salary, which is truly commendable. The Minhang Business Community Appreciates the Soldiers: The Minhang Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai County, recognizing the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers at the front in defending the country and their arduous battles over the past ten days, specifically solicited donations from all sectors to purchase 200 cotton vests, 600 towels, and 200 catties of pickled vegetables, which were sent to the front lines to express their appreciation. They also purchased pickled pig curd and other items and sent them to the 21st Hospital of the Red Cross. All members of the standing committee will personally visit the hospital to offer their condolences to the wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Commander Yu's Letter of Thanks to the National Salvation Associations: Commander Yu Jishi of the 88th Division sent a letter of thanks to the National Salvation Federation, which read: "Respectfully, the Japanese bandits are cruel and have been trampling everywhere. The Shanghai incident has aroused national indignation. As soldiers, we have a responsibility to defend the territory and safeguard the people, and we will not shirk our duty. After our division came to Shanghai to assist in the battle, the officers and soldiers had already sworn to die rather than retreat, and we would not return alive without annihilating the barbarians. Unexpectedly, the enemy, finding street fighting unfavorable, urgently sought to expand the war with the power of their artillery and air force, extending it to field battles. On the 23rd, they launched a full-scale assault on Miaohang Town. Our division happened to be in the path of their onslaught. The intensity of the hand-to-hand combat was rarely seen. Fortunately, with the soldiers' desperate defense, the enemy ultimately failed to succeed. We are grateful for your association's concern and the dispatch of representatives such as Comrade Chen Ya-fu to the battlefields to provide encouragement. We are deeply grateful upon hearing your words. We will immediately inform our subordinates that we should further arouse our blood and sincerity and continue our efforts to meet the expectations of the people, and with our utmost sincerity, we respectfully ask you to convey our gratitude and wish you well."</p>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs Seeks Clothing and Bedding: Since the Bureau of Social Affairs began seeking clothing and bedding, the names of the donating households have been published in the newspapers to express gratitude up to February 16th. Now, we will disclose the names of the donors from February 17th to February 23rd: Chen Jingru, 24 pieces of old clothing; Mr. Qu, 14 pieces of old clothing; the Huang residence, 6 pieces of old clothing; Mr. Huang, 5 dou of fried rice; Mr. Cao, 6 pieces of old clothing, 2 pairs of socks, 1 pair of shoes; Liu Xingbao, 6 sets of new cotton-padded coats and pants, totaling 12 pieces; Cotton Lizi, 10 pieces of old clothing, 2 cotton garments, 2 pairs of shoes, 2 hats; Ms. Ma, 64 pieces of clothing, including large and small pants, 36 shoes, socks, hats, and gloves, 1 bundle of children's socks; Xu Nansun, 3 sets of new cotton-padded clothing; (Mrs. Qiong) Mrs. H.S.Uone, 6 pairs of leather shoes, 37 pairs of socks, 2 hats, 1 pair of gloves; Huichang Pawnshop, 12 cotton single garments, 1 powder bag; Yang Songlu, 10 sets of plain white cloth shirts and pants, 1 set of old cotton-padded coat and pants. It is said that among the above-mentioned donors, the gifts from the Western woman, Mrs. Qiong, were particularly distinctive, demonstrating that foreigners also express sympathy for our country's efforts to resist violence.</p>
<p>Zhu Yan Offers Condolences at Shanghai Hospital: Zhu Yan, former director of the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau, along with his wife, personally visited the Shanghai Municipal Public Hospital (i.e., the 8th Wounded Soldiers Hospital) yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM to offer condolences to the wounded soldiers.

Recently, in view of the increasing number of refugees, limited supplies, and the fear that prolonged idleness may harm society in the future, in addition to sending those who have homes to return to their hometowns, they have specifically organized a career guidance department to investigate the refugees' experience and skills, first hiring them as much as possible within the shelter, and opening training classes to train apprentices with a skill.

<h3>Enemy Military Supplies All Flowed East</h3>
<p>Chauffeur Sacrifices for the Country</p>
<p>A Carload of Military Supplies Enters the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Hu Amao, a local, is 40 years old and used to work as a driver for Qin Yunsheng, the former Deputy Postmaster. After being laid off, he is now working as a driver for the South City Fire Brigade. The day before yesterday afternoon, he went to Broadway Road in Hongkou to visit relatives and friends. When he was near the Middle Hongqiao, he was stopped by Japanese soldiers who searched him and found a driver's license. Knowing that Hu was familiar with driving, they dragged him to the headquarters at Wusong Pier and detained him. Yesterday morning, four Japanese soldiers escorted Hu to a parked truck nearby, which was fully loaded with ammunition. They forced Hu to drive to the Gongda Yarn Factory. Hu had no choice but to pretend to agree, driving at full speed, escorted by the four Japanese soldiers. Unexpectedly, Amao's hatred for the Japanese was deep, and he had long had the heart to sacrifice himself for the country. Therefore, when he drove to the destination, he deliberately turned the car around and drove straight into the Pudong beach. Because the car was traveling at extreme speed, it entered the river in an instant, with waves splashing everywhere. Amao feared that there was no hope of survival.

Our association believes that during this national crisis, regarding the payment of rent, in addition to the Hongkou area should be completely exempt, the safer areas within the concession should uniformly pay rent at half price, to reduce the burden and alleviate the people's difficulties. Again, this time the Japanese Kou invaded, fortunately relied on our loyal and brave 19th Route Army soldiers to deeply understand the righteousness, rise up to make self-defense resistance, with the same hatred for the enemy, regard death as home, loyal and brave, repeatedly give the enemy Kou heavy damage, if not so, then the Japanese Kou penetrate deeply, do not know where to, under the overthrown nest, Ning have eggs intact, all our compatriots, should be inspired to conscience, jointly national disaster, all tenants should pay half the rent to the landlord, should be uniformly donated to the anti-Japanese military expenses, to thicken the army's supply, and for long-term resistance preparation, which is beneficial to the country and the nation, is extremely important and large, I understand my tenants, all express sympathy. On the landlord side, although reduce a pen income, but compared to those who destroy their families to relieve the country's difficulties, has a very big difference, at this time of life and death, if the whole country up and down, one heart and one mind, those who have money pay money, those who have strength contribute strength, is not enough to save the crisis, India and Korea, the lessons are not far away, I hope my landlord, its mutual encouragement, therefore declare, I hope you will be enlightened."</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Pulls Bargemen Unsuccessfully</h3>
<p>American Merchant Reports Matter to American Consulate for Negotiation</p>
<p>At half past three in the afternoon the day before yesterday, American merchant Da Lai 洋行's loading barge No. 659 was relying on the British merchant Taikoo 洋行's "Shandong" ocean-going ship, which was parked in the Huatong Depot in Pudong, while loading cargo. At that time, a small Japanese naval steam boat, with an empty sampan towed behind it, passed by. There were several armed Japanese soldiers on the steam boat. When the Japanese soldiers saw that there were three bargemen on the barge, they went up the barge and wanted to drag the boatman Chen Yuqi into the sampan. Chen saw that the situation was not good and fled onto the "Shandong" ship. The other two boatmen, seeing the situation, in a moment of urgency, hid in the stern cabin. After five minutes, the Japanese soldiers saw that they could not achieve their goal and returned to the steam boat and left. Afterwards, Chen Yuqi reported the situation to the dock foreman Mike. The foreman then telephoned the Shanghai General Foreman, Mr. Stirling. It is said that Stirling, because the American flag had already been hung on the barge, and the Japanese soldiers still dared to board the ship and pull people, wrote a letter detailing the incident and requested the American Consul General, Mr. Ke Yinhans, to negotiate seriously with the Japanese authorities.</p>

<h3>Ma Di Automobile Company Repair Department Staff Go on Strike for the Nation</h3>
<p>Their Ardor is Commendable</p>
<p>The enemy army has repeatedly suffered disastrous defeats, with countless casualties. All corpses need to be transported back to their country, and all kinds of transport urgently require vehicles. It is heard that they have purchased vehicles from various foreign merchants at high prices, but the number is small and insufficient for use. There are many damaged vehicles in their possession, and they intend to lure people with heavy money to repair them. The staff of the Ma Di Automobile Repair Department heard about this and were greatly indignant. Although they are managed by foreigners in their positions and the issue of livelihood prevents them from acting arbitrarily, their patriotic ardor is ultimately difficult to suppress. Therefore, they have gathered together and decided to request the factory owner to refuse to repair any enemy vehicles. They will not resume work until their goal is achieved. Their patriotic heart is truly commendable. It is also heard that since the strike, the staff have gone to the rear office of our army to volunteer as car repair workers. Our country's workers have long been looked down upon. If everyone can be as enthusiastic and patriotic as the staff of the repair department, fulfilling their duty as a citizen, contributing money if they have it, and contributing labor if they don't, then the enemy is not to be feared. It is hoped that workers from all walks of life will rise up together and not let others take all the credit.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>

<p>London The price of Japanese gold continues to fall, indicating the financial situation in Tokyo. According to reports, US banks and commercial institutions are now urging Japan to repay debts in cash immediately, so Tokyo is under pressure. This pressure is said to be due to the increasingly severe anti-Japanese commercial boycott in the United States. The American public's and political circles' resentment towards Japan is also evident (Reuters, 27th).</p>
<h3>Americans Support a Blockade Against Japan</h3>

<h3>Stimson's Letter to Borah Implies Expansion of the Navy</h3>
<p>Will Greatly Threaten the UK and Japan</p>
<p>London Stimson's letter to Borah reveals that if the Far East dispute cannot be resolved satisfactorily, naval construction will be restarted. As a result, British public opinion is paying more attention to American policy. Stimson's letter indicates that the policy set by the Washington Conference, which allows Japan to control the Japanese side of the world's oceans, depends entirely on whether the Sino-Japanese dispute can be resolved acceptably. If Japan abuses its position, the United States will abandon this policy, build a navy, and establish bases in the Pacific to prevent Japan from attempting to control China and China's vast commercial markets with unlimited resources. It is now hoped that the widespread agreement of world opinion expressed in Stimson's letter will encourage the belligerents, especially Japan, to accept an agreement that preserves face, which must not exceed the intelligence of a neutral mediator. Otherwise, the United States will use the famous "defense" and "automatic" clauses in the London Naval Treaty, creating a situation that is difficult for the United Kingdom to handle. The United Kingdom has not yet built all the ships stipulated in the treaty. Daily reports say that Washington is very concerned that Japan is building four new-style cruisers, so it has already started or will start building 31 cruisers, a number far exceeding any other country, but without violating treaty obligations (Reuters, 27th).</p>

<h3>The So-Called Confession of a Famous Japanese Figure to the British</h3>
<p>Calling Armed Invasion of China Self-Defense</p>
<p>Night-Blind Arrogance Only Reveals Its Ugliness</p>
<p>London This morning, The Times published a long dispatch from Tokyo, signed by many famous Japanese figures, such as Viscount Ishii, Duke Tokugawa, Baron Waka (illegible), Baron Matsui, and Baron Takuma. It was a response to a letter from British Cecil et al. regarding the Far East situation published in The Times on February 18. The letter stated: The current tragic situation is not due to China's weakness, but due to the ineffectiveness of China's central jurisdiction. Japan's actions are purely self-defense, in opposition to Chinese warlords, whose sole principle is to suppress dissidents and indulge their personal greed and ambition, without regard for the happiness of the people or the peace of the Far East. The bizarre talk of the Japanese now wanting to dominate Chinese land with military force is not only very dangerous, but also ill-timed, but also ridiculous. The Japanese army in Shanghai and Manchuria is legally defending its position when attacked. What Japan is doing is like other countries using military action on Chinese land to drive away the attacks of Chinese warlords. Generous but foolish sympathy for a China that is imaginary rather than real is the greatest danger to world peace today. The letter concludes by saying that the Japanese still believe that the British people retain their trust in the old allied countries and cannot prepare for Japan as a piratical adventurer, disregarding everything, and undertaking the task of conquering the entire continent (Reuters, 27th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Aid to White Russians</h3>
<p>Forcibly Borrowing the Chinese Eastern Railway to Transport Troops</p>
<p>Karakhan Questions Hirota on Four Points</p>
<p>Moscow, this morning, Moscow's newspapers universally carry news of Japan organizing White Russian troops in Manchuria. It is reported that two brigades have already been recruited this week, with former White Russian generals Mendelakin and Mudestov each commanding a brigade, and under the overall command of the White Guard Association leader General Kosmin in the three eastern provinces. Military uniforms are provided by the Japanese and are quite complete and sharp. It is also said that the White Russian army will seize the Chinese Eastern Railway as a base and attack Soviet Russia near Manchouli, while the Japanese army will attempt to break out near Baikal. The start of the operation is expected to be in the first week of May. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet Russian government is increasingly dissatisfied with Japan's plan to transport troops to areas near the Russian border in the three eastern provinces and with news of Japanese aid to the White Russians. Today, the government's official gazette published that Deputy Foreign Commissar Karakhan invited Japanese Ambassador Hirota to the ministry on the 24th to ask him to verify and explain the following points: 1) The Japanese military officer in Harbin requested 17 vehicles to transport troops at Yimianpo and Suifenhe, both of which are on the border. This is different from previous Japanese troop movements and raises political issues that the personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway cannot handle. 2) The Japanese military officer signed a contract with the Chinese Eastern Railway to transport troops at half price and to exempt the railway protection troops from transportation fees. The Soviet Russian government also considers this a political issue, affecting the current treaties between Japan and Russia and China. 3) Recently, White Russian exiles, under Japanese protection and direct assistance, have become increasingly active in opposing Soviet Russia. This contradicts Ambassador Hirota's promise to Foreign Commissar Litvinov and Deputy Commissar Karakhan that Japan would not aid the White Russians. 4) Please inform us of news about the newly formed government in the three eastern provinces and its nature. It is heard that the Japanese ambassador has requested instructions from Tokyo regarding the above four items in order to reply. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Today, the Soviet Russian government published General Galen's speech at a mass meeting in Boli, solemnly declaring that the Red Army is prepared to defend the Soviet Russian border and will never lose an inch of land. The meeting was held to celebrate the 14th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, and many important figures from the Party and government attended, with the masses expressing enthusiastic patriotism. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a telegram from Ambassador Hirota stationed in Russia. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, some of the issues raised by Karakhan need careful consideration, so a reply cannot be given immediately. However, the claim from Moscow that the Japanese are aiding White Russians is definitely without basis. Japanese military authorities even consider White Russian military movements disgusting and harmful. As for the matter of Japanese military authorities contacting the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau to transport troops to Yimianpo and other places, the Japanese government has not received official information, because this kind of request was made by the Japanese military authorities locally to the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau and was not made to the Russian authorities. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also views this as purely military and there was no need to report it to the government. According to Hirota's telegram, Moscow cannot agree to transport Japanese troops until it is sure of the true intention of the Japanese government, because the Japanese military authorities requested seventeen trains, each with fifty cars, which Moscow considers too many.

<h3>League of Nations Will Sternly Reject Japan's Reply</h3>
<p>Japanese Cabinet Believes Stimson's Statement is Dangerous According to the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, citing a Tokyo-United Press International dispatch from Geneva, the Council of Twelve, due to the impact of U.S. Secretary of State Stimson's statement on Japan's reply to the League, held an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 26th to negotiate a policy toward Japan, and decided to issue a strong rebuttal to Japan's reply and issue a stern warning.
