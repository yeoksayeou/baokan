<h3 id="c1">德内閣更迭與世界情勢華 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>一國政局之變化。有時足以影響世界之情勢。而世界情勢之變動。有時亦足轉移一國之政局。即以最近德國内閣之更迭論。其政局固受世界經濟恐慌之影響而致變動。然其政局之變動。使保守派勢力。更形擴張。實亦足增世界經濟恐慌之强度。其間頗有相互繋連之關係也。</p>
<p>夷考德前内閣總理白魯寗氏。自於一九三０年九月就任以來。迄今已歷二年有餘。氏富於胆識而有毅力。其在職之二年餘中。所施政策。恒不偏不倚。折衷於左右兩者之間。然以世界經濟恐慌。日甚一日。賠欵負擔。未邀列國允减。國内失業問題。日趨嚴重。末由解决。最近乃不得不採稍稍左傾之政策。擬定計畫。欲將東魯士等處大地主地産。收歸國有。以償國債。並以安揷貧農與失業工人。無奈此項計畫。非特爲一般大地主所反對。且因國内保守派勢力之伸張。未爲總統興登堡所贊同。致其計畫。無從實現。於是遂不得不决然引退。故白氏之辭職。直接原因固因政見與總統相左之故。其間接原因。實由蒙受世界經濟恐慌之影響。</p>
<p>今巴本内閣雖告成立。但在議會尚無獲得多數擁護之把握。解散議會。重行改選。據外電所傳。似爲不可避免之事實。他日議會解散。舉行選舉。極右派之國民社會黨領袖希特勒或有勝利之望。最近德國總統選舉。希氏雖未當選。而所獲票數佔全額三分之一。又在普魯士地方議會。社會黨勢力。夙頗强大。最近改選之結果。希特勒之勢力。竟突飛猛進。所佔議席。由六席增至一百六十二席。依此而論。聯邦議會在今日改選。正極右派最好之機會。改選結果。如果希氏一派獲勝。則巴本新閣。不過爲白魯寗與希特勒間之過度内閣而已。政局尚難安定也。若問德之選民。何以擁護希氏者近來突然增加。最簡單之答覆。即德國國民在最近國際與其本國國内情况是。感覺煩悶。希冀打破此現狀耳。</p>
<p>如以上所言。不遠於事實。可見德國政局之變動。與其所受國際不良情况之影響。頗有密切之關係。惟從另一面觀之。德國政局之變化。亦未嘗不足影響世界情况。蓋德爲負担賠欵義務之國家。德之政局如紛擾而不易安定。非惟賠欵問題。益臻複雜。抑且於戰債之償還。國際金融之流轉。以及國際貿易之振作。影響亦非淺鮮。其趨勢將使資本主義之矛盾。日見其甚。帝國主義者之衝突。日見其烈。各國不滿於現狀者各趨極端。而左右派對壘之形勢。日見其鮮明。一髮往往牽動全身。德國政局之變動。或將予世界以深刻之影響。不可不察也。</p>
<p>一國政局之變化與國際形勢。有相互之關係與作用。不僅西方如此。東方亦然。最近東亞之日本。因政變突起而政治更傾於右。中歐之德國。因閣潮起伏而其政治有愈趨右傾之勢。法西斯蒂彩色之運動。如響斯應。東西輝映。國際反俄勢力。固因而有暫時加强之可能。顧帝國主義乾内部之衝突。與一般反帝勢力之激發亦未嘗不同時進展。世變方亟。如何審時度勢。確定方針。以避免國際不良情况之影響於我。同時本共同之努力。對於國際形勢之轉變。予以若干良好之影響。實國人所宜加以考慮者也。</p>

<p>共得八項第一：：：計七十七分</p>
<p>中青名列第二：：：計六十六分</p>
<p>丨麥令成績突飛猛進中青健兒依然故我丨</p>
<p>中青·西青·麥令·美公·三十一軍·及海青六團體運動會、於昨日下午一時半起在中華田徑塲舉行田徑競技、觀者達三四千人、勞神父路頓呈熱鬧非凡、各項成績、均有可觀、鐵餅標槍及十二磅鉛球並撃落我國最高紀錄、結果麥令以七十七分榮居冠軍、中青相差十一分、居西軍、分數爲六十六、各項節目之第一名、中青僅得四種、餘爲麥令包辦、此次麥令之成績、良非中青意料所及、而王季維郝春德等名將之苦戰失敗、尤足惋惜、然我國選手之依然固我、似難敵他人之突飛猛進、敗不足恨、祇冀來日之成功耳、</p>
<p>會場情形</p>
<p>昨日爲田徑賽競技之第一聲、熱心運動之民衆、無不以一覩健兒身手爲快、加以門禁大開、不售門票、不加限制、是以觀者雲集、躋躋蹌蹌、盛極一時、約計人數、達三四千人、且塲之四週、並無籬笆等障碍物、却能遵守秩序、不可多得、然要非外兵之在塲彈壓與西人職員之鐵板面孔、恐不能至此、甚望以後國人舉行運動會中、觀衆能各自愛惜、一如昨之遵守秩序、</p>
<p>軍樂助興</p>
<p>昨日之集會、雖草率不堪、然有一極富興趣之事在焉、即蜚聲海上之麥令斯軍樂隊、蒞塲奏演、會塲景色、整刷不少、軍樂抑揚聲中、觀衆旣足之蹈之、（觀衆往往隨樂聲踏拍之故）選手亦多手之舞之、不覺精神爲之一振、惟該隊至三點鐘時、即相率而去、未免令人敗興、</p>
<p>高欄可惜</p>
<p>高欄决賽時、蕭鼎華與亨勿來相爭甚力、蕭一路佔先、大有奪得冠軍之勢、當最後一欄、蕭仍在前導、但最後之衝刺、蕭反爲亨氏所敗、觸線時亨氏僅以寸許佔先、全賴其觸線之得法、蕭則以不善觸線而敗北、此誠足爲蕭之極好經騐、以後當可改進、</p>
<p>各隊總分</p>
<p>第一：：麥令：七七分　第二：：中青：六六分</p>
<p>第三：：聯軍：十七分　第四：：海青：九分</p>
<p>第五：：西青：三分半　第五：：美公：三分半</p>
<p>四個第一</p>
<p>全部節目中中青僅得四個第一、除海軍青年會得一高欄第一外、餘均爲麥令包辦、中青所得爲程金冠二百米低欄、二八秒五分三、何德寳四百米、五四秒五分四、陸亞雄三級跳遠四十二呎二吋半、胡錦祺跳高、五呎五吋半、成績均如舊觀、未見進步、</p>
<p>個人分數</p>
<p>麥令史璜克共得十一分列個人總分第一、其成績亦殊出色、又麥令之湯史萊及沙頓各得十分、並列第二、中青方面得分最多者、爲陸亞雄七分、蕭鼎華六分、餘如王季淮郝春德均遇敵手、致遭敗北、</p>
<p>勝負關鍵</p>
<p>各項運動進行之中、中青分數節節加增、帶在麥令之上、以爲錦標可以穩得、當尚餘標槍撑竿跳乃接力三項節目時、中青當以五分佔優、但標槍麥令共得七分、中青僅獲一分、撑竿跳麥令又得八分、中青獲二分、接力賽中、中青又以六比十敗、此三項運動、中青以九比二十五敗於麥令、共失去十六分之多、以前所勝五分减去、反負十一分之多、麥令反敗爲勝、自當喜極欲狂、然中青選手並不以失敗而氣餒、</p>
<p>特殊紀錄</p>
<p>徑賽成績以麥令湯斯來之二百米二十三秒五分一、及麥令沙頓之八百米二分十秒爲最佳、三項擲重節目、均創特殊紀錄、且超過我國最高紀錄、如麥令格倫了之鐵餅達一百二四呎一吋、合米制約三十八米許、我國最佳之成績、去年濟南華北運動會亦僅三十六米餘、麥令亨特遜之標槍、其成績爲一百四十八呎五呎、合米制達四十八米許、吾國最高成績祇四十六米許、又聯軍海列斯之十二磅鉛球、計四十七呎六吋、約十四米餘、與前年潘作新偶而所得之最高紀錄相仿、我國健兒、誠不可不奮自惕勵、力求上進、</p>
<p>中青健兒</p>
<p>觀中青選手、仍保持從前紀錄、未進亦未見退、此次雖遭失敗、良以麥令選手之成績、實非我國選手所能企及、故敗亦無怨矣、惟八百米之全軍覆没、蕭鼎華之腿上受傷、良可惋惜、不無應響總分數也、</p>

<p>十五</p>
<p>我們走到師範學堂門口，宋老太告訴門房說，「我們是來請教員，要看校」</p>
<p>長」。門房說，「校長還没有來，你們在這裏等一會兒吧」。聽！一，二，三，四，五，六，七，八，九，這東西會自已璫璫璫的敲。宋老太說：：「這就是自鳴鐘」好一個自鳴鐘，我是久仰大名，今天才得會面，那是多麽快樂的一件事啊。我們一等，再等，三等，等到不耐煩了，就走到裏面去看看。一間房裏坐着三十幾個學生，黑板上寫了幾個字由一位穿西裝的先生在那兒教學生念。黑板上寫的字不像中國字，聲音却辨得清楚。大家是跟着先生同聲在念：「愛，閉，細，弟：：：」宋老太說：「他們是在學洋文」。我們又走到另一間一模樣的房子邊只聽得大家都在喊：「汪，土，司利：：：」有趣！聞所未聞。宋老太太說，我們鄕下用不着這東西。我却不敢這樣武斷。宋老太似乎不大歐喜洋文，她輕言輕語的向我耳朶邊說：　　「愛，閉，細，弟，</p>
<p>汪，土，司利，</p>
<p>中國人的嘴裏放洋屁。」</p>
<p>哈哈丨春生問我們爲什麽笑，我告訴了他，他也不住的笑了起來。</p>
<p>鐘敲十下，校長來了，大有縣老爺的架子。我們把來意說明，請他介紹一位頂好頂有本事的先生下鄕。他說：「我們還有三個畢業生，我寫信去喊一位來和你們面談。你們明天這時候來吧。寮老太聽說有三位，心裏很歡喜，她想三位都要看看，然後在三位當中選擇一位。她選擇女婿是慣用這個法子。可是竟被校長拒絕了。校長說：「我選一位頂好的和你們先談，如果你們覺得很好，他就可以下鄕，萬一你們覺得不行，再介紹别人不遲。」宋老太知道她的選擇女婿的方法在此地不能適用，也不堅持。我們便與校長點頭而别。</p>
<p>今天是没有下鄕的希望了。宋老太拉我們一起到她的姊姊家去玩。她外甥吳大少硬要請我們到飯館裏去吃大菜。我猜想是大頭菜燒肉，後來我才知道是吃外國菜。這餐飯實在是吃得比挑水還費力。我猜吳大少是個吃大菜的内行，便小心跟他學。他用匙喝湯我也用匙喝湯。他用刀切肉用叉吃，我也用刀切肉用叉吃。他不動手，我也不敢動手。奇怪！他喝湯和和尚吃稀飯一樣，一聲也不響。我於是喝湯也不敢響。春生哥却不然，他没有留心跟吳大少學。他喝湯幾乎如同老牛喝水一般的響。他還鬧了一個大笑話，把大家的肚子都笑痛了。他用刀送肉進嘴吃，一不小心，把舌頭刺了一刀，只聽他哎喲一聲，滿嘴的菜一起吐出，血兒還在一滴一滴的滴個不止。正是：</p>

<p>當初吾在日本做公使館參贊的時候，是在黎純齋（即庶昌）公使任内。</p>
<p>黎純齋在未做公使之前，曾上萬言書到軍機衙門，軍機衙門就發給曾國藩隨營調用，誰知黎純齋見了曾國藩，曾國藩就吩咐他「讀讀史記」，於是黎純齋就隨營讀史記，一讀就讀了十幾年，這也算是一件笑話。</p>
<p>吾在日本的時候，非但西洋人瞧不起日本，就是我們中國人也瞧不起日本。那時外國人批評日本有「三無」，就是：</p>
<p>男無信義，</p>
<p>女無廉恥，</p>
<p>花無香味。</p>
<p>不但日本的男人和女人吾們都瞧不起，連日本的花草吾們也瞧不起。那時，吾在日本是堂堂中國使館的參贊，大名鼎鼎的伊滕祇是部裏的主事，最近遭暗殺的犬養毅首相，吾連他姓名都還没有知道咧！</p>

<p>戰爭，我們承認它是恐怖的魔鬼，它所到的地方，便是死亡，流血：它所指着的地方，便是瘟疫，没有家，没有收穫：同時，那絕大的魔鬼！「飢餓」也跟蹤着來了。</p>
<p>這次淞滬一戰，僅僅以戰地直接受到的摧殘，我們正不知道什麽時候才可以恢復舊觀呢。</p>
<p>不過據江蘇戰後善後委員會的報告，</p>
<p>現在急急於救濟的，是那一班無家可歸無衣無食的戰區人民。單單用以建設茅田畝灌溉工作等，至少，也得要三十萬元。而它所包括的地方，也只有六個，，便是損害最大的大塲，嘉定，和寳山，崑山，表浦，常熟。</p>
<p>在大塲老百姓犧牲了的有一六八人，房屋則有三八一被燬。在嘉定死也死了一百多個老百姓，房屋却有六四三座被火燒掉。其餘如要用在建設臨時房屋的至少也得要十多萬，單單購辦種子費恐怕也要八萬多塊錢，不然，如不趕速補救，明年必將陷於無米可食，無子可種，絕大的飢荒災難年頭，將臨到我們頭上來了。</p>

<p>駐紮在無錫的憲兵第二營營長王公遐。是一個樂觀主義的革命者。頭腦旣很新鮮。言行又極坦白。因爲他善於笑。所以他的同事。替他起了個綽號。呌「快活將軍」。</p>
<p>有一天。這位有趣的快活將軍。大發其請帖。上面寫着某日某時。請到某某酒樓聚餐。</p>
<p>他的戀人胡曠女士。也邀了伊的許多朋友親戚。說某日某時。請到某某酒樓使飯。</p>
<p>届時。他倆的朋友親戚。都到了某某酒樓的一間最大的餐室中。這餐室用一扇大屏風隔成兩間。間的牌子上寫着「王君宴客。」一間的牌子上寫着「胡君宴客」酒席吃到一半的時候。忽然有一位武裝同志。把那屏風撤去。仍舊打通成一大間。兩邊的賓客。都面面相覷。莫名其妙。不多一刻。這位武裝同志。突然又跳上方桌。對衆宣佈道。「今天是王公遐君和胡曠女士的佳期。他倆研究了多年的戀愛。决定在今天結婚了。因爲這是一個可紀念的新生命的開始日。所以特地請諸位來同樂一會。」到這時候。一班剛才來聚餐聚得莫名其妙的朋友。才恍然大悟。不約而同的發出一聲「嗄！」的聲音。於是這一幕最新式而含有滑稽性的喜劇。就宣告完成了。</p>

<p>— 朱𦐂</p>
<p>讀我友鄭逸梅君記「富春江之鰣」。偶觸所懷。亦得關於鰣之故事若干。拉雜書之。藉爲時鱗張目。</p>
<p>鰣江産。每值黄梅時節。即銀鱗翻騰於揚子江頭。漁者張網江中。罟而售之。惟鰣爲時魚。僅産於四五月中。過時則渺焉無踪。目　性與海魚同。離水即死。又難久儲。故鮮鰣之保價。乃倍昻於常魚焉。</p>
<p>蘇省産鰣之區。僅鎭江及常熟七丫口等處之江中。故食鮮鰣者。類皆　　江中。俟鰣出來。即就而烹食之。曩者老友謝　鄂常。曾特赴鎭江魚山僧寺中。一嘗鮮鰣風味。謂鮮飫肥美。極快朶頣之樂。今則又届　雨時節。而故人飛雁久疏。引領雲天。未知老友亦有此豪興否也。</p>
<p>吳下積習。每届節序。親朋間類皆餽贈食品。以敦交誼。惟禮尚往來。交際廣闊之徒。與故舊之家。往來之戚族旣夥。自不能一一餽送新鮮物品。往往以受於乙者。轉餽於丙。而以丙物還之於乙。轉輾餽贈。以爲節禮。端午時節。銀鱗鰣魚。乃與角黍等物。同爲不可或缺之節禮。惟鰣本淡魚。不能久儲。而價又昻貴。餽物者又豈能人購鮮魚。於是味臭肉餒之鰣魚。尚轉輾餽送於親朋之間。爲傭婦獵賞。故　十有「皇鰣魚送人」之諺。今則生活程度益高。此種餽送節禮之虚僞風俗。已較往者稍殺。社會間或不至再有「皇鰣魚送人」之舉發現也。</p>
<p>閒時嘗與程小青先生輩談殺風景事。「烹鰣去鱗」與「背山起樓」。「清流濯足」「與美人談米鹽」等語。同屬人間煮鶴焚琴事也。</p>
<p>鰣産江中。入海即名爲鮝。故鮝鰣之形味。類皆相似。惟鰣尤鮮飫適口。致「鰣魚多刺。金　味酸」。爲饕餮家恨事。不知鰣以多刺而飫。猶美人之僅可飽餐秀色。同爲食肉之流。不能領略者。其味乃雋也。</p>

<p>語云。「大亂之後。必有大疫。蓋當兵燹之時。兩軍相接。腥風血雨。水深火熱。後經腐化薰蒸。即釀成疫癘。而流毒無窮矣。此次暴日犯境。焚燒我市宇。屠戮我人民。而被害者之尸體。又多掩埋未週。其中所含　質有機物。經一種細菌作用。而生成各種尸毒。其毒素甚强。隨空氣之傳播。及於人身。遂足制人死命。</p>
<p>邇來天氣漸熱。空氣乾燥。貽害尤烈。故應羣策羣力。早事預防。最有效之法。莫如購備防疫臭水。澆洒居室各處。則毒菌消滅。可無疫患。至臭水之選擇。當推五洲大藥房出品之亞林防疫臭水爲最佳。蓋亞林臭水。藥料純足。製造精良。殺菌力甚强。且係完全國産故也。</p>

<p>希臘東北的薩龍尼加Salonica地方。有一起訴訟案件。案中有一個重要的證人。據原告說是已經死了。法官命他呈上死亡證。以資證明。原告無法可想。就到那人的墓上去。將墓碑掘起。扛到法</p>
<p>堂上去。證明那人確已死了。</p>
<p>波蘭華沙Watsaw城中。有一對青年夫婦。從禮拜堂中結了婚出來。頭並頭的相視而笑。肩並肩的緩緩走去。路旁忽然有一個婦人送與他們一個筐子。說是一件薄禮。他們收下了。在婚宴席上拆開看時。却是一個玉雪可愛的嬰孩。</p>
<p>英國交際社會中婦女們夜間所戴的飾物。最近流行一種鮮花的項圈。用無數生香活色的花朶兒穿紥在一起。每條代　約自五先令至十五先令。比了珠鑽的項圈經濟萬倍。可是每晚必須更換二次。因爲薦了就很難看。</p>

<p>厥後在兩江督署。先公常欲維持鄕居生活狀况。平日衣服。不准用絲綢。一日客至。予著羽紗襖。綻有闌干。客去而文正公入。以目注視。問母云。滿女衣何華好。母亟答云。適見客耳。羽紗洋貨。質薄而粗。價比呢廉。比湖縐更賤矣。所綻闌干。南京所織。每尺三十文耳。平日亦著此襖。外罩布褂。見客則去罩衣。先公所定章程。子女嫁娶。皆以用二百金爲限。衣止兩箱。金器兩件。一扁簪。一挖耳。一切皆在此二百金中。予等紡紗績麻。缝紉烹調。日有定課。先公親自騐功。幾無暇刻。昔時婦女鞋襪。無論貧富。率皆自製。予等兼須爲吾父及諸兄製履。以爲功課。纺秒之工。予至四十餘歲隨先外子居臬署時。猶常爲之。後則改用機器縫衣。二十年來。此機常置座旁。今八十一歲矣。猶以女紅爲樂。皆少時所受訓練之益也。余所以瑣瑣述此者。蓋社會奢儉之風。皆由少數人所提倡。貴人妻女。實爲奢侈作俑之尤。且每爲男子操行事業之累。故先公對於予等。督責如是之嚴也。余旣早受此等訓育。終身以爲習慣。選購衣料。常取過時貨。因其廉也。憶甲午年在滬道署中。先嫂曾惠敏公夫人來署。見余所買花邊。式樣陳舊。因言此物無人用矣。今所行洋花邊。花色鮮美。勝此十倍。予曰。予已見之。且代人買過。然價視此數倍。余所買者。雖已過時。余自愛之。且喜其價爲中國所得。金錢不外流也。嫂笑云。靠你一人所省。能有幾何。余曰。雖然。若人人能如是著想。或皇太后能見及此。而不愛洋貨珍玩。則所省多矣。</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第九回　附專車逐客有虚驚　坐冷衙化石成遐想</p>
<p>話說安玉田在包廂中因葉作章向他讓座。脚踹下去落了空。險些跌了一交正在那千鈞一髮大驚失色的當兒。幸有毛德順在後面趕忙伸手將他扶住。得免當塲出醜可是前面架子上的茶杯已碰翻了一隻。滴滴搭搭的在流著茶水。總是舉動輕浮。失了儀了。坐下去後。不免面紅耳熱肉跳心慌。在深責自已的孟浪。倒是葉作章肚量寛宏。毫不介意。任憑茶房們來揩拭水漬他仍笑迷迷的向安玉田問話起先所問的只是些籍貫和學歷的尋常事項安玉田還不難答對。藉此慢慢定下心神。并偷視葉作章的丰采。只見他身形雖然矮小。精神郤甚發揚。兩目炯炯有光。逼射起人來似庽有莫大的威棱。言談中也聲響洪亮。語句詼奇。粗豪而亦復饒有嫵媚。一談到梁笑雲頭上。他竟重拍了安玉田一下肩膀道。你能娶著這樣一位好夫人。比我這做督軍的福分還大你還要來捓我做什麽。不過笑雲老八旣保荐了你來。以伊所賞識的人。又當然是决没有錯。教我又那能夠不借重呢。說罷。連摇晃着他那猴頭般的小腦袋大打哈哈的直笑個不了。笑得安玉田毛骨悚然。陡又想直這明明是笑我像拆白一流人物。全憑裙帶上的關係來向他求官。所以他敢拿我當一種開心的資料。公然就來侮辱照那士可殺不可辱的說法。我必須表現一點骨氣給他看看才對。當下就由這一點憤怒的心情。消失了時才那些忸怩靦覥的意態。逕戀爲義正詞嚴的挺撞了過去道那是私人的愛情事件。不值得談的。我此番來見督軍。是因爲久聞督軍熱心欲爲地方造福并需要人才帮助。才自已介紹自已向督軍提出一種清匪安民的意見。我並很願於鄙見得蒙采納之後。就能言能行。發生實效由我將那些久已接洽成熟的土匪民團早日編成勁旅。爲國效勞。地方上旣得肅清匪患。督軍這裏又可擴充實力。我以報督軍者兼報鄕里。得遂我平生的志願。那才是最大的幸福呢。像這一番話。氣息雖很壯盛。意義究尚是支離。本不見得就能驚人。</p>

<p>江寗各市鄕農民、今歲育蠶者不及去歲十之二三、而近城各鄕均孵育改良會所發之洋種、並有蠶校畢業生指導進行、故雖天時惡劣、而損害尚不重大、繭産尚優、奈繭行均未租出、祇有一二家抑價秤收、蠶户成本不廉、類均不願賤售繭價最高不過二十餘元、最低祇十四五元、農民類均携回、以土法自烘、或集資委托繭行代烘、以備自繅土絲、是以繭行無形停秤云、</p>

<p>函促主席　前晚、吾方委員俞鴻鈞及温應星、復函委員會主席委員克銀漢氏、請促日軍、從速撤退、以符協定、函文大意、略謂、日方對前函所開各點、均未加以注意、按根據五月五日協定中規定恢復一二八前之狀態一點、現在日軍尚駐於淞滬路東及沙涇港一帶、絕未遵守協定所載、請即秉一月以來合作之精神、始終維持協定云云、克銀漢得函後、昨已分别通知其他各委員矣、</p>

<p>市府工部局談判結果</p>
<p>已擬有整個解决方案</p>
<p>行政主權完全在我國</p>
<p>關於公共租界越界築路内之一切行政權等問題、迭經市政府代表俞鴻鈞、與工部局代表費信惇、亘數月之談判、至昨晨十時、雙方代表意見、始趨一致、於是交涉告一段落、俟雙方各請示上峯後、即可完全决定、各情分誌如下、</p>
<p>俞鴻鈞之談話　昨日上午十時、市府秘書長俞鴻鈞、訪晤工部局秘書長費信惇、關於越界築路問題、繼續磋商、約半小時即散、據俞氏談、是項交涉、市府與工部局代表、今日（即昨日）已協商得一整個解决之方案、俟雙方請示上峯後、即可完全决定、内容包括警務工務等項、而行政主權完全在我、詳細條文、暫時未便發表云云、</p>
<p>組織特别警察　大美晚報云、本（四）日正午、公共租界工部局情報處發表、中國當道與工部局所派代表談判越界築路問題、冀商得一同意基礎、刻已進行至可以具體建議送交中國當局與工部局考慮之地步、擔任中國當道代表之市政府秘書長俞鴻鈞亦有同樣聲明、至談判内容、雖猶未能從工部局方面正式徵實、據大美晚報所聞、則越界築路之警權與主權、實爲此次在滬談判之主要問題、按照最近建議、中國政府保留越界築路之主權、及完全管理權、但或將組織特别警察、聘洋員爲監督、此項監督及一切雇員、受上海市政府指揮、其薪俸亦由上海市政府發給但須鄭重聲明者、此次在上海商定者純屬非正式性質、祇爲南京方面正式談判之基礎而已、</p>
<p>工部局之情報　昨據工部局情報處發表消息云、公共租界工部局及中國當局雙方所派之代表、磋商關於界外馬路問題之協定基礎、現已達到相當程度、即將有具體方案、提出於工部局及中國當局云、</p>
<p>越界築路歷史　查公共租界越界築路之開始、尚遠在一八六二年、當時太平天國軍隊、突擾淞滬、當時民衆、紛逃租界、時租界區域尚絕渺小、其最西處以跑馬廳爲界、此時難民旣衆、公共租界當局、乃設法西展、即行建築靜安寺路、由泥城橋以迄靜安寺爲止、至一八六六年、戈登將軍帮同中國當局、撃潰太平天國軍隊、乃復藉詞建築戈登路新閘路等、至一八九九年時、越界築路擴展至十三英哩、嗣後東北西三部、亦積極向外擴展、至一九一八年、總計面積達二九八九三英哩、至一九二五年、又增至四八零九三英哩、據當時估計、所有越界築路之費用、工部局共費一００三九一一０兩之鉅、越界築路時之購地費用爲二八九四六六０兩、此係當時時值、惟因此中國當局與工部局方面、每輙發生交涉、迄今已不知凡幾、今市當局、能將此事澈底解决、後此海上中外當局、當可又减少糾紛不少也、</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨據蚌埠電訊，駐蚌第一隊一零二號達格拉斯機，三日晨飛往光山轟炸共匪，九時許回蚌，機上所餘三十五磅炸彈一枚，脫繋落下繁閙之太平街上，炸死市民二十二，傷四十一人，各界大憤，該飛機師之鹵莾滅裂，遺害市民，固當治以應得之罪，</p>
<p>若照駐蚌飛機第一隊一零二號的數字觀之，我國飛機，原屬不少，何以此次淞滬戰事，絕無片機隻影，飛翔抗敵戰，而飛機之塲，則大築而特築，其他不可知，即如松江一地言，圈地不下六七百畝，人民損失，不知凡幾，而結果飛機隻影全無，此種「華容道」擺給何人看呢，還是要「死諸葛嚇生仲達呢，」更可異者，現在戰事業已終了，正當農作之際，而該飛機場仍不肯發還，不知當局是何用意，</p>
<p>本來我國飛機缺乏駕駛人才，的確不能與日本堂堂一戰，我想這種飛機，或者去剿滅幾個共黨，或優爲之，今觀蚌埠市民，竟無端而遭此重大慘劇，則該飛機師，不但技術幼稚，即其粗心浮氣，玩忽業務一端察之，其剿共能力與伎倆，亦可想而知矣，</p>
<p>中國無論何種武器，不會殺敵人，專會殺自已人，於此一端，可以概見，</p>

<p>— 金化元</p>
<p>在輕金屬元素裏，有一種重量很輕的元素，就是名呌鋁Aluminium的，在元素表裏，原子序是十三，原子量是二十七二，</p>
<p>鋁在地殻中不但是很輕的元素，並且是所含成分很多的元素，約占地殻中全元素中的百分之八８％，</p>
<p>鋁是在美國渥海渥洲Ohio奥伯林大學OherlinCollsge的一個學生何爾CharlesMartinHall，於一八八六年二月二十三日所發明，</p>
<p>在一八二七年，何爾發明之前五十九年已經有位德國著名化學家伍勒教授ProfFriedrichWohler實騐得幾小粒的較塵埃還小的鋁，因爲其得之非易，而價錢昻貴，所以未引人注意，直至何爾，應用他自已所發明的電分析法，使可較很容易的從礦苗氧化鋁ALO中提煉出來，而獲得多量的鋁，</p>
<p>鋁是和金一樣的，在空氣中不容易氧化，和鐵適相反，它的化合力遠不及鐵，因爲鐵是很容易氧化而生成氧化鐵的，丨即俗語所謂鐵銹，丨但是鋁和金也略有微異，就是金是絕對不易氧化的，而鋁有時也有氧化之可能，然而即使氧化了之後，要化分它，使它還元成未氧化前之原物質，却和要使它氧化有同樣之困難，這倒和我們人類中一部份人的性情有相類似，你們要我做某件事，我認爲不願做的，我始終不做，但是即使因某種問題而做了，又要我放棄，這却不能，倒是一付很强毅的皮氣，　　現在我們在市塲上看見的一種熱水瓶的蓋，以及一種小鍋子，重量很輕而不很光亮的，敲敲它發音又不尖銳的，這就是用鋁製，此外尚有電器的一部份茶杯等，也都用鋁製，輕便而靈敏，不呆笨，這是多麽進步呀，</p>

<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>（三）白糖梅子的厄運</p>
<p>「阿要買白銅（糖）梅子，廿鈿買一個來：：：」</p>
<p>沿東新橋街缺口阿根應時而設着一個折糖梅子的攤頭，他坐在一隻高橙上，斜戴便帽，一身藍色粗布的短衫褲，上衣敞開，露出裏面的汗衫，一條紡綢的褲帶，墜在兩腿中間，手裏拿着一柄拂繩，很安閒的向一堆白糖梅子上輕輕飄拂，</p>
<p>「阿根！」一個同樣打扮的人，不過頭上戴着一頂可以摺疊的瓜皮帽，從對面ＸＸ里裏跑出來，直着嗓子喊阿根，阿根似乎一驚，帶着笑容說，</p>
<p>「老大（讀如杜）好久不見」從藍布短衫的腰帶袋裏掏出，一盒金鼠牌香烟，授一枝給所謂「老大」者，一枝放在自已兩唇的嘴角邊，</p>
<p>老大燃了烟，在攤上揀了一枚大的白糖梅子，塞進嘴裏咀嚼，</p>
<p>「生意好啊！」聲音雖然含糊，但是聰明的阿根知道來者不懷好意說的，</p>
<p>「老大，啥個閒話」阿根仍堆着笑臉說，</p>
<p>「阿根！别打腔兒，儂燕子窠關脫，阿拉本鈿那能？」，</p>
<p>「老大，别生氣，」阿根在放金鼠牌香烟的袋裏掏兩塊洋錢出來，「今朝生意勿好，還有格多梅子」，</p>
<p>老子找儂三日（讀如孽）倒寫意，賣起白糖梅子來哉，阿根！脚拚脚，再挨十塊洋錢出來，孫子再說閒話，</p>
<p>「老大，大家自家人，儂吃個烟那能？」阿根的話，顯然也硬了，</p>
<p>「操那」他升起右手打了阿根一記耳光，</p>
<p>阿根不防他有這一手，也立起身來，對準老大胸口就是一拳，於是兩套藍布短衫褲扭成一團，如其偶然走過這裏，可以聽得一片「操那娘」的聲音，</p>
<p>終於被同僚把阿根老大拉開，兩人反剪着手，還恨命的想向前去，阿根的便帽更斜了，老大的瓜皮帽已不知去向　　「操那，總有日脚做脫儂」，老大被大衆横拉直扯勸開了，返過身來說，腰擺拉心浪，操那」，</p>
<p>一堆白糖梅子，靜靜地躺在行人道旁的污泥溝中，被戰爭犧牲了，</p>

<h3 id="c213">續絃與再嫁 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 秋意</p>
<p>已上了年紀的隔壁烟紙店裏老板王先生，在去年，他的老妻，不幸因病故世了，王老先生當然十分悲慟，也流了幾滴老淚，事後我們曾聽得王先生這樣對人說，「我决不願再續絃，我是一個將要做棺材坯子的老頭子了，」</p>
<p>昨天烟紙店面前是鬧盈盈的，店堂裏又高高燒了兩枝紅燭，王先生的親友也到了不少，我爲好奇心所驅使，便去探聽他的學徒小紹興，</p>
<p>「你不曉得嗎？今天師父討師父娘啊！」小紹興帶著笑容這樣回答，王先生的大媳婦，是個青年寡婦，他的丈夫在三年前已患肺病死了，她除買菜燒飯管理家務外，最近自她婆婆逝世後，又要服侍她的幾個小叔，在我們看來，她不僅是一個十分能幹的女子，同時還是一個非常和靄的少婦，可憐她不幸進了王家的門，不上半年，便做了寡婦，一生的幸福，也就葬送了，她除終日像牛馬般的勞苦工作外，簡實没有絲毫的妄想，講到「再嫁」二字，不但没有想到，就是想到了，也認爲這是違背婦道的，要被人家臭駡的，何况在這吃人禮教勢力範圍内的王先生家庭内，更是絕對不可能的事，</p>
<p>唉！已上半百年歲的男子，可以續絃，可以光明正大公開的續絃，方在青春時期的寡婦，却不能再嫁，並且社會家庭又嚴防她再嫁，其實續絃與再嫁，有什麽不同，這是中國社會的病態，也是從事婦女運動者改革家庭制度者所應注意的一大問題，</p>
<p>社會上儘有有了一個再來一個的討小老婆，納姨太太，和尚未出嫁，而不幸對方已死的抱神位做親底把戲，天下竟有如此極端相反的事實呢，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Change of German Cabinet and World Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The change of a country's political situation can sometimes affect the world situation, and the change of the world situation can sometimes also shift a country's political situation. Take the recent change of the German cabinet as an example. Its political situation was indeed affected by the world economic panic, resulting in change. However, the change in its political situation has further expanded the power of the conservative faction, which in fact has also increased the intensity of the world economic panic. There is a mutual connection between them.</p>
<p>Considering the former German Chancellor Brüning, he had been in office for more than two years since he took office in September 1930. He was rich in courage and perseverance. During his two years in office, his policies were always impartial, compromising between the left and the right. However, as the world economic panic worsened day by day, the burden of reparations was not reduced by other countries, and the domestic unemployment problem became more and more serious, it could not be resolved. Recently, he had to adopt a slightly left-leaning policy, formulating a plan to nationalize the land of large landowners in East Prussia and other places to repay national debts, and to settle poor farmers and unemployed workers. Unfortunately, this plan was not only opposed by general landlords, but also because of the expansion of conservative forces in the country, it was not approved by President Hindenburg, and his plan could not be realized. Therefore, he had to resolutely resign. Therefore, Brüning's resignation was directly caused by his political differences with the president. The indirect cause was the impact of the world economic panic.</p>
<p>Although the Papen cabinet has been established, it is not yet certain to obtain the support of the majority in the parliament. Dissolving the parliament and re-electing it seems to be an inevitable fact according to foreign telegrams. If the parliament is dissolved and elections are held in the future, Hitler, the leader of the extreme right-wing National Socialist Party, may have hope of winning. In the recent German presidential election, although Hitler was not elected, the number of votes he received accounted for one-third of the total. Also, in the Prussian local parliament, the power of the Socialist Party has always been quite strong. As a result of the recent re-election, Hitler's power has surged, and the number of seats he occupies has increased from six to one hundred and sixty-two. Based on this, if the federal parliament is re-elected today, it is the best opportunity for the extreme right wing. If Hitler's faction wins as a result of the re-election, then the new Papen cabinet will only be a transitional cabinet between Brüning and Hitler. The political situation is still difficult to stabilize. If you ask why the German voters who support Hitler have suddenly increased recently, the simplest answer is that the German people feel bored with the recent international and domestic situation and hope to break the status quo.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it is not far from the facts. It can be seen that the changes in the German political situation are closely related to the impact of the international bad situation. However, from another perspective, the changes in the German political situation are not enough to affect the world situation. Germany is a country that bears the obligation of reparations. If the German political situation is turbulent and difficult to stabilize, not only will the reparations problem become more complicated, but also the repayment of war debts, the flow of international finance, and the revitalization of international trade will also be affected significantly. The trend will make the contradictions of capitalism increasingly serious. The conflicts of imperialists are becoming more and more fierce. Countries that are dissatisfied with the status quo are heading to extremes, and the confrontation between the left and right factions is becoming more and more distinct. A single hair often moves the whole body. The changes in the German political situation may have a profound impact on the world and must be observed.</p>
<p>The changes in a country's political situation and the international situation have a mutual relationship and function. This is not only the case in the West, but also in the East. Recently, Japan in East Asia has undergone a sudden change and its politics have become more right-leaning. Germany in Central Europe has undergone ups and downs in its cabinet, and its politics have shown an increasing trend toward right-leaning. Fascist-colored movements have echoed each other, shining from the East to the West. The international anti-Russian forces may have a temporary strengthening because of this, but the internal conflicts of imperialism and the stimulation of general anti-imperialist forces have also progressed at the same time. The world is changing rapidly. How to assess the situation, determine the direction, avoid the impact of the international bad situation on us, and at the same time, based on common efforts, give some good influence on the transformation of the international situation, is what the people of the country should consider.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Investigation Team Stayed in Beidaihe Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Inspected Jiaotong University When Passing Through Jinzhou</p>
<p>Gu Weijun Will Accompany the Investigation Team to Japan</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan: Sir Lytton, Chairman of the League of Nations Investigation Team, and the members from the United States, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan, and our representative Gu Weijun and his party, took a special train on the Weifengshan Railway at 7 pm on the 4th. They arrived at Yuguan via Shenyang and Jinzhou. They arrived in Jinzhou at 1 pm and got off the train to inspect Jiaotong University. After half an hour, they came west. The special train of the Weifengshan Railway consisted of 11 carriages. The head of the train was decorated with the Manchukuo flag, and the words "Special Train for the League of Nations Investigation Team" were written outside the carriages. When the special train arrived, personnel who came from Beiping to welcome them, and Brigade Commander He Zhuguo, and people from all walks of life in Yuguan, warmly welcomed them on the platform. Zhu Guangmu, Wang Guangqi, He Zhuguo, Cai Yuan and others boarded the train first and expressed their condolences to Mr. Gu Weijun. Then Gu expressed his welcome to Lytton and others. Gu's wife also boarded the train to express her welcome. Then the whole group changed to the Beining special train. At 8 pm, the special train left westward to Beidaihe for one night so that the investigation team could visit Beidaihe on the 5th and then go to Ping on the same day. All the members of the investigation team had been subjected to wind and dust for more than a month in the Northeast, and Representative Gu was especially touched. After arriving in Yu, everyone felt very happy. (Special telegram on the 4th)</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan: The League of Nations Investigation Team held a final meeting with Japanese officials in Shenyang on the 3rd and inspected Beida Camp. At 6 am on the 4th, they took a special train on the Weifengshan Railway to the west. They stayed in Jinzhou for a while. At about 6 pm, they will arrive at Yuguan. The Japanese armored train had already arrived at Yu at more than 5 pm to clear the way. Our Beining special train and armored train will arrive at Yuguan from Qinhuangdao at more than 4 pm. (Special telegram on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The investigation team left Shenyang this morning. Zang Shiyi and Zhao Xinbo both went to the station to see them off. They will arrive at Yuguan tonight and change to the Beining special train to Beidaihe. It is scheduled to come to Ping at noon on the 5th. Wang Guangqi, Mrs. Gu, and others all arrived in Yu this morning. (Special telegram on the 4th)</p>
<p>Beidaihe: The special train of the investigation team arrived at the seaside of Beidaihe at 9:30 pm on the 4th for the night. They will visit tomorrow morning and go to Ping at noon. (Special telegram on the 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Honjo Held a Farewell Banquet the Night Before Last <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Shenyang) The League of Nations Investigation Team will take a special train to Ping this morning. Honjo sent representatives to see them off. They will arrive at Yuguan at 6 pm tonight and plan to spend the night in Beidaihe and then go to Ping. Honjo held a banquet for the team members last night. Japanese attendants also attended. Dr. Gu Weijun did not attend. (Reuters telegram on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Honjo hosted a banquet for the members of the investigation team at the Kwantung Army Headquarters on the 3rd. Gu Weijun did not attend for some reason. (Special telegram on the 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Wang Guangqi and Others Arrived in Yu to Welcome Them <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Shanhaiguan: Wang Guangqi, Yan Deqing, Cai Yuan, Ning Xiangnan, Zhang Weibin, and Mrs. Gu, and a platoon of escorts sent by the Suijing Office, all took a special train to Yu at 5 pm to welcome them. The Yu Guan Station to Beidaihe area was guarded by teams sent by the Ninth Route Army. Brigade Commander He Zhuguo, in addition to welcoming them at the Yu Station, accompanied Staff Officer He Jinghua to Beidaihe to facilitate the command and guard. Today, the Yu Station is decorated with colorful signs of welcome from all walks of life, and welcome slogans are attached to the overpass. The Japanese and Manchukuo flags are flying at the station, and the pseudo-Manchukuo flags are also inserted outside the Great Wall. (Special telegram on the 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Japanese Foreign Ministry Sends Note to the Investigation Team <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Lytton Investigation Team, stating that Japan is willing to welcome Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese attendant of the Investigation Team, to Japan, but it must be stated that the visit to Japan is not for investigation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Investigation Team was ordered to investigate the situation in Manchuria and China only. (Reuters telegram on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the investigation team sorts out the investigation materials in Beiping, they will go to Japan again to hold a final meeting with the Japanese authorities. At that time, Gu Weijun, the Chinese attendant, also decided to go to Japan. The feelings of the Japanese government and people are as follows: (1) The authority of the investigation team is to investigate Manchuria and mainland China, and there is no need to investigate in Japan. (2) Gu Weijun, as an attendant, has no right to speak when meeting with the Japanese government authorities with the investigation committee. However, Gu's claim to investigate Japan is an excessive and violent statement, which only makes people feel uncomfortable. (Dentsu News Agency telegram on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is learned that the League of Nations Liaoning Case Investigation Team will go to Japan for inspection after completing the investigation report and sending it to Geneva. Gu Weijun also decided to go with them. However, a spokesman for the Japanese government actually stated this afternoon that the League of Nations Investigation Team has no right to investigate Japan after arriving in Japan. Dr. Gu Weijun is only an attendant and cannot participate in the formal meeting between the Investigation Team and Japanese government officials. It is heard that after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs meeting today, it has instructed the Japanese attendant Yoshida to notify Earl Lytton that the Japanese government does not object to Gu Weijun's visit to Japan, but it is not convenient to formally entertain him.

<p>Beidaihe: Gu Weijun said, "The 30 million compatriots in the Northeast are suffering from the pain of national subjugation, which makes people feel sad wherever they go. I really can't say anything now. I hope the people of the country will look far ahead and eliminate private opinions. If there is no way to deal with foreign countries, then everything will be destroyed. Some people say that China is vast and populous and will not be subjugated in the end, but looking at the Northeast, we know that it is not so. Defending the country and protecting the people is the duty of everyone, whether in the government or in the opposition. After arriving in Ping, I plan to take some time to go to Beijing to tell you about it. As for the matter of going to France, I have to wait until I have contacted the government before considering it." (Special telegram on the 4th)</p>

<p>Saito's Speech Attracts Attention</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen Nations of the League of Nations is planning to reconvene on the 12th of this month to discuss China's request to have local consuls or the Liaoning Case Investigation Team report on the military situation in northern Manchuria at any time so that the League of Nations can know the truth. (National News Agency telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japanese Prime Minister Saito's announcement of Japan's foreign policy in the Diet yesterday has aroused attention here regarding the Far East after various rumors. However, after careful investigation, it is learned that as far as the League of Nations is concerned, there is no new development that can change the procedure of the League of Nations General Assembly because the Japanese army in Shanghai has already withdrawn. The report of the Lytton Investigation Team may not arrive here for a while. It is now learned that since Dr. Yan's request on May 31 to investigate the Japanese promise to withdraw the Japanese army in the three eastern provinces into the railway area, the Chinese side has not continued to request it after inquiring to what extent it has been fulfilled. The responsible party of the League of Nations stated that Lytton did not have this suggestion regarding the rumor that Lytton advocated Japanese trusteeship of Manchuria.

<h3 id="e20">A Certain Important Person Refutes Saito's Foreign Policy Speech <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Prime Minister Saito delivered a speech to the Japanese Diet on the 3rd on the new cabinet's foreign policy. A reporter thought it was very important, so he visited a certain important person in the diplomatic circle and asked for his opinion. According to the discussion, (1) Regarding the Shanghai Truce Agreement, Saito said that the Chinese army should be stationed at a certain distance outside Shanghai. In fact, the Chinese army is currently stationed temporarily at the original defense, and the agreement does not restrict the actions of the Chinese army. Saito's explanation is one-sided because the Shanghai incident was originally caused by the Japanese army's invasion of our country's territory. If the Japanese army no longer has this kind of violence, then there will be no unexpected actions in Shanghai, as Saito said. (2) The Japanese side's so-called roundtable meeting aims to make the Chinese and foreigners in Shanghai live and work in peace. However, according to the actual situation, Shanghai's safety was not a problem before the Shanghai incident. If the Japanese army no longer invades, then the interests of the Chinese and foreigners will naturally not be affected. Even countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Italy believe that there is no need to hold this meeting now. However, if an international conference is convened (in the form of the Washington Conference) to resolve the entire Sino-Japanese incident, the Chinese government may also agree. (3) The Chinese government has repeatedly protested seriously to the Japanese side regarding the pseudo-organization in the eastern provinces and issued a declaration to the international community that it will never recognize it. The Japanese government initially made excuses to cover up, and then said that the Chinese side's protests were all speculations, and did not dare to openly assist the rebels. Now Saito has officially declared cooperation with the pseudo-organization, which shows that he is still following the old tricks of the demise of Korea to seek our eastern provinces, which makes people more suspicious of Japan's international credibility.

<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign news, Russia and Japan are indeed secretly contacting. Japan is not in a hurry to advance the Northeast issue because it is not afraid of the investigation team, but is actually leaving room for Russia to divide the spoils. It is also heard that Japan will not come forward temporarily, but will let the pseudo-government in the Northeast first reach an agreement with Russia to restore traffic, exchange envoys, and so on. Europe and the United States are paying close attention to the matter first. (Special telegram on the 4th)</p>

<p>Discussion Presented to the Central Political Council</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to government officials today, the issue of restoring diplomatic relations with Russia was discussed at yesterday's Central Political Conference. Many people agreed to restore diplomatic relations immediately, but there were also people who advocated careful consideration. It has now been decided to submit this issue to the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee for decision.

<p>(Nanjing) A certain member said, "Regarding the issue of returning the capital from Luoyang, although it is rumored that it will be implemented in July, the Northeast issue has not been resolved. In theory, it is not good to express a return. In fact, the Executive Yuan originally handled all government affairs in Nanjing, but it was only sent to Luoyang for imprinting. As for the section where government expenses will be restored to the full amount before the national crisis starting in July, it has not yet been determined. The salaries of various agencies in Nanjing are not consistent. The Ministry of Railways, Communications, Industry, and other departments with income, in addition to issuing 50% of the maintenance fee, also issue several percent of allowances. The rest only receive 50%. The military agencies also control the expenses inconsistently. The party affairs agencies are also the same. What is even worse is that the expenses of embassies and consulates have been in arrears for eight and a half months, and the expenses of agencies such as the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission have also been in arrears for several months. Judging from the current financial situation, it is impossible to restore the normal salary level in July." (Special telegram on the 4th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The British firm Hutchison Whampoa has experienced worker strikes and losses due to the opposition of its laid-off workers towards three successive compradors over the past two years. Unable to improve its business, the company announced the closure of its factory last month. Workers demanded that the company pay severance and dismissal fees. The Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to mediate. After six rounds of negotiations, the company, determined to close the factory, refused to accept the workers' demands. On the morning of the 3rd, more than fifty workers remaining at the factory went on strike in support of the laid-off workers. In addition to ordering the patrolmen to be on alert, the company requested that British sailors come ashore in preparation. Various Party, government, military, and police agencies of the city immediately dispatched personnel to mediate and negotiate with the British Consulate. The British Consul also felt that the company's handling was improper and personally went to the Municipal Government at Shen time (3-5 pm) on the 4th to express his willingness to mediate and requested that the Social Affairs Bureau persuade the workers to return to work early to avoid accidents. The Municipal Government, at the request of the British Consul, immediately sent personnel to negotiate with the Hutchison Whampoa labor union to have the workers return to work early and await a resolution. As a result, the labor union has agreed to notify the workers at the factory to return to work early and await a resolution. However, the crux of the Hutchison Whampoa labor dispute is not about those working in the factory, but rather about those who have been employed by the factory in recent years and reside near the factory. Unless everyone gets work, individuals are unwilling to be hired. Therefore, each labor dispute has been fruitless. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<p>The new German cabinet publishes its policy platform</p>
<p>Willing to cooperate peacefully with other countries externally</p>
<p>Striving for administrative reforms internally</p>
<p>The President orders the dissolution of Parliament</p>
<p>Elections to be held in early July</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency Berlin, 4th - The policy platform of the new German cabinet was released to the newspapers today and broadcasted to the whole country by radio, breaking the usual practice of only reading it in parliament. The content is based on maintaining peace at home and abroad and engaging in transformation. It first explains the dissolution of Parliament and then praises the achievements of former Prime Minister Brüning, praising him as the first German politician after the European War who had the courage and strategies to deal with the Treaty of Versailles, economic decline, and various difficulties caused by the abuses of the parliamentary system. It further states that the reason why the finances of the German Federation and its states and most cities are so exhausted is entirely due to the various basic reforms necessary to deal with the emergency situation. Other than the initiation of administrative and financial reforms, nothing has been carried out. Since the war, successive governments have tried to alleviate the predicament of unemployment with increasingly socialist policies, but the result has only increased the number of unemployed, indicating that things can no longer be done in the old way. Germany has reached a crossroads today. Those who are willing to work together to create a new nation based on Christian principles must be clearly distinguished from those who have caused the state to decline and become chaotic through elections. It also said that the new government will do its best to safeguard the foundation of the country's survival, and in order to obtain sufficient taxes to maintain the maximum efficiency of the administrative organs, it will have to promulgate a part of the emergency decrees proposed by the previous government in order to balance the budget. Afterwards, it stated that the government could not make promises at this time, nor did it want to make predictions. It was willing to be judged by the people of the country based on its actions in the future, rather than empty words. Then, it turned to foreign policy, stating that international conferences that attempt to resolve all issues of significant interest to Germany in the future are imminent. The government will engage in negotiations and formulate Germany's response policy. The responsibility is arduous. The goal we hold in each meeting is to cooperate peacefully with other countries and obtain Germany's complete equality and political freedom and economic recovery opportunities. Only when Germany enjoys the same rights and economic opportunities as other countries can it contribute to saving the world. Finally, it solemnly declared that the new government has absolutely no partisan meaning, will transcend all political parties, and will strive to revive Germany's morality and economy.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency Berlin, 4th - Today, the German President issued a decree dissolving the Parliament, saying that the recent election situation has proved that the Parliament can no longer represent public opinion. The new cabinet also released a policy platform at the same time, which included attacks on Parliament's democratic system and statements that the republican government has weakened Germany's moral strength, with a strong fascist tone.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency Berlin, 3rd - German President Hindenburg signed a decree dissolving the Parliament tonight. According to today's cabinet meeting, it was decided to ask the President to dissolve the Parliament immediately to avoid the new cabinet failing in the Parliament. The President then approved the decree that night. As for the general election date, well-informed sources expect it to be on July 3 or July 10.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency Berlin, 3rd - The Prussian Parliament decided today to adjourn until the 22nd and has not been able to resolve the deadlock over the election of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency Berlin, 3rd - The new Prime Minister, Papen, originally belonged to a faction of the Catholic Party. Since he took office as Prime Minister, he has not left the party. However, since Papen was appointed Prime Minister, the rift between the new government and the Catholic Party has been widening. Papen recently sent a letter to Kass, the leader of the Catholic Party, questioning why the Catholic Party could not tolerate the cabinet organized by its own people. Kass replied, accusing Papen of being unfaithful. According to Kass's statement, Papen had told Kass before forming the cabinet that he had no intention of forming a cabinet, but Papen broke his word shortly after and did not consult with the Catholic Party in any way. Furthermore, Papen had previously stated that if he wanted to form a cabinet focused on the country in the future, all the talents in the country, including the Socialist Party, should be recruited. However, Kass believes that the current new cabinet is neither Christian nor Germanic, and can be described as neither fish nor fowl.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency Berlin, 3rd - The German National Party issued a declaration today, stating that it is not responsible for the new cabinet and its policies, and that the party's attitude towards the new government depends entirely on its achievements in seeking the welfare of the country. It concluded by saying that the German public will express its opinion in the next general election, and that decisions guiding German policy should be temporarily suspended before the general election. The National Socialist Party has not yet officially expressed its attitude towards the Papen cabinet. However, judging from Hitler's election speech in Mecklenburg, Hitler is willing to have the various parties advocating national sovereignty join a mixed government, and the new government believes that it can govern until after the general election. However, according to a report, the Chief of General Staff declared that the new government can govern for at least four years. This statement has not yet been denied by the authorities.</p>

<p>组敢死队发挥威力</p>
<p>自由主义几乎绝迹</p>
<p>Rampant activities of Japanese pan-nationalist groups</p>
<p>Organizing suicide squads to exert power</p>
<p>Liberalism almost extinct</p>
<p>Hua Lian News Agency Communication on the 3rd: According to a certain gentleman who recently returned to the country from Japan, the military has become invincible in Japan since the Northeast Incident last year, and the yakuza have risen up in response. Most of them are veterans. Those who oppose authoritarian policies are hard to keep alive. Therefore, liberals have almost disappeared in Japan. For example, during the Shanghai war, Dr. Nitobe gave a speech in Tokyo, saying that the Shanghai Incident was not a dispute between the Chinese and Japanese people, but a private dispute between the Chinese and Japanese warlords. At that time, the veterans and yakuza who were present refused to let him off and immediately ordered the doctor to apologize on the spot, otherwise they would kill him immediately. Nitobe obeyed and was able to save his life. This spring, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, which has always been known for its liberalism, published an article in support of constitutional government and warned the fascist party not to overstep its bounds. The yakuza were furious again and sent suicide squad members with bombs to visit the Asahi Shimbun to face-to-face rebuke President Murayama. President Murayama apologized and swore that he would never have such remarks again in the future in order to preserve the operations of the newspaper. It is also common to see yakuza distributing leaflets in dance halls and tea houses, scolding men and women, so many dance halls in Japan have suffered. When entering and leaving the port, the inspection of printed materials is very strict. Even a piece of old newspaper used to wrap things cannot be taken ashore. The media has been blocked in the name of "what the military needs." It is almost hopeless to hear fair and impartial remarks in Japan. Among these yakuza members, veterans organize secret suicide squads. There are more than 2,600 members, with an average of fifty or sixty members in each county. On the evening of May 15, they threw bombs at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, while blowing up various key locations in Kyoto and shooting the Prime Minister. The purpose was to gather all the municipal police at the Metropolitan Police Department, take advantage of the dark night to occupy key agencies in the entire capital, and at the same time announce martial law, suspend the constitution, and announce the fascist revolution. Because the time was not ripe, it ended in a complete failure. However, the movement of this faction has deep roots, and it has military force as its background, plus a certain duke in the Upper House and a certain important person in the Privy Council are its spiritual supporters. It is said that a certain member of the imperial family also agrees with it. Therefore, the Japanese police can be said to be meticulous in their investigations of the Communist Party, but they seem to be walking on thin ice when searching the yakuza. The reason is really here.</p>

<p>House of Representatives Secretly Discusses Manchuria Issue</p>
<p>Your House Has Understood the Retention of the Army Minister</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 4th. For the purpose of reorganizing administration and the military, the government has submitted a public offering law to this session of the Diet regarding retirement grants and public bonds of 25.4 million yuan. The total number of personnel to be laid off is approximately 20,000, including 13,000 employees and 6,700 officials, of which approximately 2,000 are senior officials.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 4th. Immediately after the formation of the cabinet, it faced an extraordinary session of the Diet. Because the government had not fully prepared its policies for the Diet and important current issues were piled up like mountains, the Diet members raised questions, which were impossible to predict. Therefore, Prime Minister Saito and the cabinet members were quite worried. However, judging from the situation in yesterday's Diet session, it was not as dangerous. In particular, regarding the ominous incident, after Army Minister Araki proactively explained it, the atmosphere in Your House greatly eased. Moreover, there was generally a favorable attitude toward Prime Minister Saito's policy speech. The first difficult hurdle in the Diet battle has been passed without incident, and people can rest assured. From now on, the focus will be on the general budget meeting. Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th. The House of Representatives' Budget General Meeting convened at 10:30 a.m. First, Chairman Okuchi proposed to abolish the subcommittee, and then the three budget proposals were put on the agenda together. Ryuji Nagashima raised questions, and the Minister of Finance declared an active policy. At 11:20 a.m., a secret meeting was held to discuss the Manchurian issue. Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 4th. The plenary session of the House of Peers convened at 10:10 a.m. today. Takahashi of the Koyu Club questioned the government about its method of immigration to Manchuria. Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai replied that in the future, the so-called four-headed politics of unified Manchuria would be used to control and guide Japanese residents in Manchuria. However, at present, bandits are being suppressed, and it is quite difficult to carry out immigration immediately. Once the state of Manchuria is established, immigrants will be transported in succession.</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Chengdu Telegram. All Newspaper Offices, Please Note: The telegram has been sent, Gan (Area near Garze) has been recovered, the border police are slightly relieved, but the exaggeration of the enemy's situation is deeply felt, and the road ahead is difficult. Recently, we received a telegram from Deng Ji, Commander of Garze, stating that intelligence reports that De Mo Se Daiben, a Tibetan official, has newly led approximately 3,000 elite soldiers to Dajin Temple and will soon reinforce the front line. Kezheng Daiben has also transferred more than 5,000 militiamen from the Wenge area and is en route. Yesterday, the south bank had increased its troops by 700 to 800 men, and it is said that they plan to detour through Zouyu to counterattack Qianhua. On the north bank, more than 1,000 soldiers have been added, and it is said that they have decided to counterattack Garze. Changtai sent a message from Wenge, saying that he will dispatch 800 soldiers to garrison Duogong, surveying the current situation. There are fears of fierce battles in the coming days. Our strength is not superior to the enemy's. Careful consideration and overall planning are causing great anxiety. At this moment, the enemy is wantonly burning and killing everywhere, and the tragic situation is unbearable to describe in detail. It is said that the fall of Kang District is tantamount to the withdrawal of Xiping. The Dalai Lama is cunning and must not be treated like a minor bandit. All our countrymen have feelings. The situation in Sichuan and Kang is as closely related as the wheels of a cart to its frame. We are exhausted by our sole efforts, and dare not complain. But to defend the whole of Tibet with just a corner of Sichuan and Kang is certainly hard to be victorious. Moreover, the treasury of Shu is exhausted, and there are no funds. The roads in Shu are poor, and there is no reliance on diplomacy. We are violating the taboo of attacking strength with weakness, so can we avoid turning it into defeat? Caught in this dilemma, unable to rest or eat, we deeply fear that the loss of the western frontier will shake the whole situation. Those imperialists will take the opportunity to plot, and we worry that the disaster may be even worse than the fall of Liaoning and Shenyang. If unfortunately we are forced to compromise, we comrades in the army will truly be unable to escape blame, and even the wise and elders of the whole country will have to share the responsibility. The situation is urgent, and we cannot choose our words carefully. We implore the central government to have mercy on the loyal hearts of the soldiers at the front and deeply consider the consequences of tolerating bandits and fostering traitors. Immediately investigate and issue a series of telegrams approving the allocation of large amounts of salaries and weapons to strengthen the will to die for peace and show the sincerity of the guards. Not only will the people of western Sichuan be grateful to the extreme, but also the prestige of the central government will be restored throughout the country. We sincerely appeal again, and await your discernment. Respectfully submitted by Liu Wenhui, Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan-Kang Border Defense.</p>

<h3 id="e97">The Tragic Bombing in Bengbu <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Bombs Suddenly Fall off Aircraft Wings</p>
<p>Landing in the Bustling Taiping Street</p>
<p>Killing 22 People and Injuring 41</p>
<p>The Squadron Leader Responsible Has Been Detained</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Zhao Jingxian, squadron leader of the No. 1 Aviation Squadron stationed in Bengbu, and pilot Chen Jinshui, piloted a Douglas aircraft No. 102 from Bengbu Airport on the morning of the 3rd of this month, carrying ten bombs, and flew to the Guangshan area of southern Henan to bomb the communist bandits. Seven bombs were dropped, and three remained attached to the wings and did not fall. When flying back to Bengbu at 9:15 a.m., one of the bombs, weighing 35 pounds, was shaken off its mooring by the aircraft and fell on the wooden boards in front of Liu Xingsheng's general store at the north end of Taiping Street. With a loud bang, it killed 22 male and female citizens and injured 41, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy in Bengbu. It was completely unexpected. When the bomb exploded, white smoke shot upwards, and the sound was like thunder. Liu Xingsheng's building was blown into a huge hole, and a corner of the window frame was blown away. This area happened to be a bustling market, with pedestrians coming and going. Nineteen people were instantly killed, lying scattered on the street. Many of the injured were also lying stiffly in pools of blood. At that time, corpses were lying in the streets, with blood and flesh blurred, which was a terrible sight. After the bomb exploded, pedestrians did not know the truth. Those who were not hit ran away in panic, and nearby shops also closed their doors one after another, and the order was greatly disturbed. The Third Precinct of the Public Security Bureau immediately sent police officers to the scene for rescue after receiving the report. Soon after, the Military Police Inspectorate, the Garrison Headquarters, the Public Security Bureau, and the Security Team heard the news and each sent police teams to suppress the situation, guarding the main streets, prohibiting idlers from passing through, and strictly guarding with live ammunition to prevent bandits from taking the opportunity to riot. Before long, Zhou Tianze, a medical officer from the Fourth Division's Medical Office, Sun Wanting, head of the Bengbu Red Swastika Society's rescue team, and Yu Liqiu, head of the Red Cross Society's rescue team, also led medical soldiers and rescue teams to the scene to provide assistance, carrying the injured to various hospitals for treatment. All the bodies of those killed by the bombing, except for six bodies that were claimed by their families at the scene for burial, the remaining fourteen bodies (including one who died in Pingxin Hospital) were temporarily placed in the Great King Temple in the west of the city by the laborers of the Red Swastika Society, awaiting identification by the families. In addition, five rickshaws were destroyed and were taken to the Third Precinct for collection. The Garrison Headquarters brought Zhao Jingxian, the leader of the No. 1 Aviation Squadron responsible for the incident, to the headquarters, where Xu Tingyao personally questioned the cause of the accident. According to his statement, of the remaining three bombs, one fell and exploded in the air above Taiping Street, and the other two fell at the airport, but fortunately, neither exploded. Xu then handed Zhao over to the Fourth Division's Military Law Office for detention, awaiting legal action. The names of the killed and injured are investigated as follows: Guo Ruyi, 6 years old, boy, lives at No. 58 Taiping Street, his father runs a foreign iron shop, only this one son, killed. Shang Xiaoquan, 70 years old, is a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, out for diagnosis, sitting in a rickshaw, his head was blown off.

<h3 id="e98">Newspaper Assesses the New Cabinet's Future China Policy <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Many Difficulties in Shanghai and Manchuria Issues</p>
<p>Pay Attention to the Upcoming Report of the Investigation Team</p>
<p>Tokyo Hokoku Shimbun says: The current situation of the Empire has fallen into an extremely critical and impoverished state. Since the collapse of the Inukai Cabinet and the formation of a national unity cabinet, from the perspective of the goal of diplomatic regeneration, the content value of the new cabinet can be viewed from two points: its combined cooperative effects of various factions, including the powerful elements of diversified distribution, and the fact that its cabinet members have a majority understanding of the new era of diplomacy. It is expected to guide the Empire's future diplomacy on a bright path. Looking around at today's international relations, it is truly an era of unprecedented economic depression. In the future, due to the rise of economic nationalism, fierce economic wars will inevitably break out around the world, and the Empire's situation will naturally become more critical. In addition, after the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, the existence of external reefs hindered the progress of the Empire's national destiny everywhere. Although the politics of the State of Manchuria has progressed to an orderly form, and the Shanghai Armistice Agreement has also been formally signed and is being implemented in order, the completion of the overall situation has not yet been allowed to be optimistic. Because today, to thoroughly resolve the problems of Manchuria and Shanghai, there are indeed various difficulties. Even if we discuss the real situation of the State of Manchuria, the anti-government war has not stopped, and it is difficult to predict what will happen to the issue of recognition of the new country. Although the Shanghai Armistice Agreement has been concluded, how the aftermath of Shanghai will be resolved also requires various economic twists and turns. Therefore, the major difficulties of these two issues are the current major responsibilities of the new cabinet. As for how the League of Nations Investigation Committee will make a ruling after the completion of its investigation, its impact on the future of the Empire is particularly worrying. Moreover, due to this Sino-Japanese dispute, the relations between Japan and the United States and between Japan and Russia have revealed obvious traces. The new cabinet should urgently sever the roots of this tangled mess and renew its external image. We believe that today's foreign policy should take national self-defense as the warp and coordination with other countries as the weft. Between the two, we should strive to maintain a balance. If we only seek international coordination and forget the danger to ourselves, or only seek to defend our own country and are not tolerated by the international community, neither is a blessing for the country forever. We strongly hope that the new cabinet will be more cautious in its foreign relations in order to deal with this major crisis.</p>
<p>Tokyo Jiji Shinpo says: The League of Nations Committee's investigation of Manchuria has lasted for more than a month. Most of the investigation of the local area has been completed, and it will soon leave Manchuria to compile a report and draw a final conclusion. The importance of the issue is self-evident. However, when the investigation committee entered Manchuria, the problem of refusing Gu Weijun occurred, and then the problem of meeting with Ma Zhanshan occurred in Harbin. This is a new wave that occurred in Manchuria after the September 18th Incident. Now that the local investigation is about to be completed, they must have a firm grasp of the situation. Although the solution proposed in the report cannot be predicted, the basis of all concrete proposals is that Manchuria, under such a new situation, cannot be restored to its original state before September 18th. They must have recognized this undoubtedly. As for ensuring the future peaceful state of Manchuria and securing the rights and interests of the Empire, this is the most important issue in Manchuria. Whether the various facts collected by the investigation committee can be recognized by the Japanese government and a solution can be made is not yet known. During this important period of diplomatic negotiations, the previous Wakatsuki and Inukai cabinets did not consider the final solution. In the future, the Saito cabinet should establish a policy toward Manchuria before the investigation team arrives in Tokyo, pay attention to the content of its report, and ensure that it is in line with reality, so that it can determine a concrete path for a positive policy toward Manchuria.</p>

<p>Military Administration Case in Honolulu</p>
<p>Already Submitted to the House of Representatives for Discussion</p>
<p>Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun says: The military administration case for the Hawaiian Islands proposed by US Navy Committee Chairman Britten has already been submitted to the House of Representatives' Review Committee for discussion. Britten explained the reasons for the case, saying that if the residences of Japanese people living in Honolulu were searched, a Japanese conspiracy to destroy American fortresses would be discovered. He also said that the natives of Honolulu and the Japanese people cannot be regarded as honest American citizens. Washington State elected Republican Congressman Albert Johnson also echoed Britten's statement. As a result, the atmosphere of the committee suddenly became tense. The most noteworthy thing is that the famous wartime reporter of the United States, Gobons, also strongly advocated the necessity of implementing the military administration case in Honolulu.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Red Bandits Withdraw from Zhangzhou <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Fleeing to Nanjing and Longyan</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Fang Shengtao, Acting Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, recently went to Tong'an with Commissioner Lin Zhiyuan to supervise the army in counterattacking Zhangzhou. Upon hearing the news, the Zhangzhou Red Bandits immediately changed their strategy. On May 26, they abandoned Shima and retreated the front-line bandits into Zhangzhou. On the 27th, they abandoned Zhangzhou again and retreated to Nanjing. Chen Guohui's troops of the First Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army stationed in Tong'an sent a battalion of soldiers on the 28th to inspect the vicinity of Shima and Zhangcheng from Jiaowei. Seeing that there were indeed no traces of bandits, but fearing that there were still tricks, they returned. On the morning of the 29th, Wu Shu's replenishment battalion of the Forty-ninth Division (compiled from local bandits in Zhangzhou) was the first to enter Zhangcheng. In the afternoon, Fang Shengtao ordered the two brigade commanders, Chen Guohui and Yang Fengnian, to lead a team each to continue to enter Zhangma from Tong'an Haicheng. Local order gradually became safe. Fang Shengtao himself decided to lead Lin Shuguo's Marine Corps into Zhang on the 30th to command the troops to pursue Nanjing. Yesterday (30th), he reported the recovery of Zhangma to the Provincial Government and the Central Government, stating that the bandit suppression military affairs are currently progressing, and he must stay in Zhang to command the front-line troops, making it difficult to return to the province temporarily. The rear defense is still entrusted to Liu Heding. Liu's division has three infantry regiments and a special service battalion in the province, stationed at the northeast gates. Liu also plans to convene a joint meeting of the party, government, and military in the coming days to discuss comprehensive security measures.</p>
<p>Another report: The Red Bandits withdrew from Zhangzhou on the 26th and moved to Jinlong Mountain and other places. Chen Peiyu's battalion of the Provincial Defense First Brigade first entered Zhangcheng on the 28th. Later, due to the disorder in the county and to prevent the Red Bandits from having tricks, they withdrew from the city again that night. On the morning of the 29th, Fang Shengtao, upon hearing the report, sent Wang Zuqing's Second Regiment to assist in Jinjiang to maintain defense and sent a team to pursue and suppress them. Fang also sent Cai Zhuchan to the county government to maintain county administration. Jiangdong Bridge and the second and third districts were also divided into fleeing Nanjing and Longyan by the masses and alliances after. The bandits in Shima also retreated to Nanjing. Lin Shuguo then led Huang Maohe's troops to advance to Shima on the 30th (May 31st).</p>

<p>More Than 2,000 Bandits Killed or Wounded in the Battle of Rucheng</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The pseudo-3rd Army Group of the communist bandits, led by Peng Dehuai, with more than 10,000 troops and 3,000 to 4,000 guns, has been using the treacherous terrain of the border area to contain the troops of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan provinces since they fled to the border area of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan, allowing Zhu Mao's two forces to survive in southern and western Fujian. However, after Peng withdrew from Guidong, he fled back to Nie Du Yingqian on the border of Chongyi, Shangyou, and Suichuan, intending to cut off the connection between Fan's brigade of the Guangdong Army and the large Ganyu Ganzhou. At that time, Fan's brigade had already returned to Yangmei Division on the border of Chongyi Shangyou and the intersection of Nankang and Dayu, and communicated with Li Zhenqiu of Ganzhou and Ye Zhao Zhang Meixin's troops in Dayu Xinfeng. The troops of Li Ming Liu Shaoxian and others of the Eighteenth Army of Suichuan have already been connected with the two divisions of Wang Dongyuan and Chen Guangzhong of Guidong. The bandit, failing to succeed, changed his strategy. At dawn on the 29th of last month, he fiercely attacked Jilong on the border of Jiangxi and Hunan, intending to invade Hunan. At that time, Yu Hanmou, Chen Cheng, Liu Jianxu, etc., ordered Li Ming Liu Shaoxian, Fan Dexing, Wang Dongyuan, and Chen Guangzhong to jointly encircle and suppress the bandits. The two sides fought fiercely. Yesterday, the General Headquarters issued a telegram of victory, which stated that "Peng's bandits attacked Jilong, intending to invade the territory of Hunan. The national army in the area bravely fought back, charging dozens of times and fighting fiercely for a day and a night. Finally, the bandits were defeated on the evening of the 30th. In this battle, more than 2,000 bandits were killed and more than 1,000 guns were seized." As for the southern Jiangxi area, Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Army of the Guangdong Army, is still in Dayu. The three divisions of Li Zhang and Ye are stationed in Ganyu Dayu Nankang Xinfeng and San'nan to search for scattered bandits and implement rural cleansing. Recently, we received a letter from Ganzhou stating that the peasant bandits in Maodian Jiangkou and other places on the east bank of the Gan River have been cleared by a division of the Guangdong Army.</p>
<p>Another report: After the failure of Zhu Mao Peng Li's various forces to attack Ganzhou a few days ago, Peng Dehuai's remnants temporarily fled to the area of Nankang and Shangyou Yingqian from Tiancun in the Eighth District. The Guangdong First Army then encircled and attacked the bandits. Unable to support themselves, the bandits fled to Rucheng County, Hunan. It is now heard that the bandits in the Rucheng area burned, killed, looted, and plundered. Wang Dongyuan Liu Jianxu of the Hunan Army and Chen Zhang Chen Hanguang, etc., stationed in northern Guangdong, led their troops to encircle the bandits a few days ago. The battle in Rucheng was the fiercest. It is estimated that more than 1,000 bandits were killed, more than 1,000 bandits were wounded, and many bandit guns were seized. Currently, the remaining remnants of the bandits number only 4,000 to 5,000 people with more than 3,000 guns. They have fled to the Shangyou area, and the wounded bandits are being transported to Wenying Yingqian. The 14th Division, 52nd Division of the 18th Hunan Army, and the 2nd and 4th Divisions and the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the 1st Guangdong Army have been mutually contacted and will launch a large-scale encirclement of the bandits, aiming to annihilate them.</p>

<p>Dispatching Sun and Li as Chief and Deputy Commanders</p>
<p>Zhang Heilian's Troops Successfully Reorganized</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In order to pacify the region, Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, has specially dispatched Sun Tongxuan, commander of the 20th Division, and Li Shuchun, director of the Department of Civil Affairs, as the chief and deputy commanders of the temporary bandit suppression campaign in northern Shandong. They will lead troops to eliminate the accumulated bandits, in order to pacify the region.  Furthermore, this morning (the 2nd), a bandit suppression meeting was held in the Provincial Government to discuss the bandit suppression plan. Prior to this, telegrams were sent to the military units stationed in northern Shandong and officials of the local militias, requiring them to send representatives to participate. Therefore, those attending the meeting, in addition to Han Fuqu, Sun Tongxuan, and Li Shuchun, also included Hou Zhaolin, the representative of Li Hanzhang, brigade commander of the 85th Brigade of the 29th Division stationed in Dezhou; He Mengjiu, chief of staff and representative of Liu Guitang, deputy commander of the Shandong Garrison Force stationed in Gaotang; the battalion commander of the mixed battalion representing Zhao Renquan, commander of the Northern Shandong Militia stationed in Linqing; and Liu Shuxiang, chief of staff of the Third Route Army Headquarters. Han first instructed Li Shuchun, Sun Tongxuan, and the various representatives, and then discussed the bandit suppression plan. It is rumored that it has been decided to order Zhang Shulin's unit of the 58th Brigade of the 20th Division to participate in the bandit suppression in northern Shandong. In addition, a portion of mortars and machine guns will be dispatched separately, ordering the 1st Regiment and the brigade headquarters of Zhang's brigade to depart tonight. Sun Tongxuan and Li Shuchun are scheduled to leave Jinan for the north tomorrow (the 3rd) at 4:00 PM, accompanied by the pistol battalion of the 20th Division. It is planned to go to Pingyuan first, and then to the Xiajin area. It is said that the bandits near Pingyuan number only one or two hundred, and the troops should be able to resolve the situation upon arrival.</p>
<p>Regarding Zhang Heilian's troops in southern Shandong, Han Fuqu had previously planned to reorganize them. Xia Ziming was sent to make contact, and there was already some progress. Subsequently, the bandits had a misunderstanding with the local militia and were surrounded and severely attacked by the militia, scattering to Yaozhuang near Baodu Mountain. The situation was extremely dire, and they were almost out of food, resorting to cutting and burning green wheat for sustenance. Recently, Han again sent Xia and Meng Guangshan, director of the headquarters' adjutant office, to make contact. They arrived at Yaozhuang on May 31st and met with Zhang Heilian and Wang Changyou on the morning of June 1st. Zhang made every effort to express his eagerness to surrender, and Li Douyin's unit, entrenched in Lanling Town, more than 150 li from Baodu Mountain, also expressed its willingness to follow Zhang in returning to righteousness and willingly serve Han. Xia and Meng, believing that the negotiations were successful, immediately departed from Yaozhuang for Zaozhuang, and took the Jinpu Railway's second-class train to return to Jinan this morning (the 2nd) to report the results to Han. Han immediately agreed to the reorganization and ordered the troops in southern Shandong to cease their offensive immediately. It is planned to have Liu's troops concentrate in Nan Shahe, and vehicles will be dispatched the day after tomorrow (the 4th) to transport them to Yucheng for reorganization. Meng Guangshan then took the Jinpu Railway train back to Yaozhuang at 9:00 PM tonight (the 2nd) to notify Zhang Heilian and others to assemble and first bring them out of Baodu Mountain in order to await the train at Nan Shahe. Xia Ziming is scheduled to go to Yaozhuang again tomorrow (the 3rd) to assist Meng Guangshan in coordinating everything. (2nd)</p>

<p>Only the Special Business Tax Has Not Been Abolished</p>
<p>Wuhu Chamber of Commerce Endorses Opposition to Civil War</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: After Wu Zhongxin, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, and Chen Tiaoyuan, Commander of the First Route Army, were ordered to abolish the additional salt tax and eight special business taxes some time ago, Xu Tingyao, commander of the Fourth Division, strictly enforced it in the northern Anhui region.  Recently, the Provincial Government also sent a telegram to the salt tax offices in the Huizhou area, ordering them to stop collecting the additional salt tax on salt.  The Anhui Special Opium Tax Office in southern Anhui, located in Wuhu, also announced its cancellation today (the 2nd).  The director, Yang Chunpu, also sent telegrams to various branch offices to close down.</p>
<p>The education community in Anqing, due to seeking funding from the Departments of Education and Finance, was insulted. It specifically telegraphed the provincial middle schools in Wuhu, requesting unanimous assistance. Each school will unanimously suspend classes and is currently discussing the matter.</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Federation of Commerce, believing that the Provincial Government did not comply with the Ministry's orders, disregarded the difficulties of businesses, and continued to collect eight special business taxes such as bamboo, wood, rice, and grain, issued a declaration on May 31st and telegraphed the governments of sixty counties, requesting them to stop the extortion at any time. The merchants have decided to automatically stop paying taxes.</p>
<p>The Wuhu Chamber of Commerce held a representative meeting on May 31st and resolved to participate in the movement to oppose civil war. It elected standing committee members Wu Xingzhou, Cui Liang, San Zixi, and others, totaling seven people, as representatives to attend the Great Alliance and telegraphed its support to the Shanghai sponsoring organizations.</p>
<p>Chen Tiaoyuan, Commander of the First Route Army, was previously suppressing bandits in Hefei. Now that the siege of Liu'an has been lifted, the bandits have retreated to the west of the river, and Xia Douyin's troops are also advancing rapidly. The situation has become relatively relaxed. Therefore, on May 31st, he passed through Wuhu and went to Beijing to meet with Chiang Kai-shek and Li Jishen, the Chief and Deputy Commanders of the Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, to report on the situation and the plan for eradication. The defense of Liu'an was entrusted to Hao Guosuo in conjunction with Wang Jun. (2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e105">Tianjin Circles Express Sympathy for the Movement to Abolish Civil War <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Eight-Route Trade Union Advocates Disrupting Civil War Equipment</p>
<p>Sun Chuanfang Discusses the Reasons for Eliminating Civil War</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Shanghai circles launched the Great Alliance to Abolish Civil War, and after the telegram arrived in Tianjin, leaders from all circles expressed their approval. The Money Trade Association, the Banking Association, and the City Chamber of Commerce have already issued telegrams expressing their support. Zhang Boling, president of Nankai University, also recently expressed his personal views, stating that the Chinese people have already suffered the pain of civil war. At this critical time of national crisis, when we should be united against foreign aggression, the movement to abolish civil war is a necessary plan. Some people suspect that its future effectiveness will be limited, but he believes that it depends on whether the people truly love their country and are truly awakened. If they truly love their country and are truly awakened, then the entire nation will be determined to join unanimously, and the effectiveness will naturally be great. Zhang also gave a public speech, stating that "For the past twenty years, there has been no solution to the political problems, education has stagnated, and industry and commerce have declined. Today's foreign aggression is caused by internal strife. Why do the Chinese people just sit idly by? I think this is because the people themselves believe that they have no ability, and even if they appeal, it will be ineffective. But now we have reached a critical juncture for the survival of the nation. If we can eliminate internal strife, we will live; if we cannot eliminate internal strife, we will die. Since we clearly recognize that China cannot tolerate any more civil wars and political disputes, the Chinese people should unite and launch a great movement to abolish civil war. If everyone joins, our strength will naturally be great, and even a few ambitious people will probably not dare to advocate for chaos again. Now, all circles in Shanghai have launched a movement to abolish civil war. This is a necessary way to save the fate of the nation and a movement that everyone should participate in. Tianjin is a major commercial port in North China, and its patriotic movement has always been second to none. I hope everyone will unite and express true public opinion, eliminate internal strife, and maintain peace." According to Chen Wenbin, a standing committee member of the City Federation of Trade Unions, each trade union has sent representatives to the meeting, expressing their extreme willingness to join the movement to abolish civil war. However, this movement cannot be achieved by just sending telegrams and issuing declarations. Everyone must unite to be effective. The association will convene a representative assembly of all trade unions in the coming days to discuss concrete measures, with each trade union leading the city's 100,000 workers to sign their names and jointly launch a movement to abolish civil war, using the solid strength of the whole to work effectively. According to the person in charge of the Preparatory Office of the Eight National Railway Trade Unions Federation, the Eight-Route Trade Union Federation is still in the preparatory stage and should be established this month. The association extremely approves of the movement to abolish civil war. In addition to sending separate letters to the eight trade unions under its jurisdiction in the coming days (Jinpu, Beining, Pinghan, Pingsui, Jiaoji, Longhai, Zhengtai, and Daoqing), it will also send separate letters to the trade unions of the Jinghu, Huhang, Yuehan, Guangjiu, Chaoshan, Wuchang, and Zhuping railways, requesting them to lead the workers in launching a movement to abolish civil war. The most effective way in the future is for the trade unions of each railway across the country not to transport troops and military supplies participating in the civil war and to find ways to disrupt its civil war equipment. This idea has been telegraphed to the southbound representatives to contact all circles in Shanghai and to exchange views with the Jinghu and Huhang trade unions in the vicinity. Sun Chuanfang, residing at No. 32 Avenue Dubail in the French Concession, recently told reporters that the changes in national affairs over the past three years have been infinitely regrettable. Now, the movement to abolish civil war, I dare say, is supported by the people of the whole country. It can be said that people share the same heart and the same reason. There have been many civil wars in the past twenty years. If we can eliminate civil war, so that the people who are in dire straits can breathe a sigh of relief, it will be a great thing. I hope this matter is not just empty talk, but emphasizes implementation. Being able to alleviate the suffering of the people by even a little bit is to increase the vitality of the country by a little bit. I also have some opinions on this anti-war movement. Because every civil war must have a cause, I hope everyone can have further measures to completely eliminate the causes of civil war, then civil war can naturally not occur. This is one. Is the war against the Communists within the country a civil war? Some people say that the Communists are an internal problem and cannot be considered a civil war. This is indeed true, but the Communists will definitely defend themselves, saying that they are a revolution, different from bandits who rob homes. The government regards them as bandits. We will also regard them as bandits. However, the government has been suppressing the Reds for several years without seeing them eliminated, and their potential strength is growing day by day. The facts are there and should not be concealed. There must be a major reason for this. In the civil war of the 13th year of the Republic, I once saw it as a confused fight. In fact, except for the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, almost all the past civil wars can be viewed in this way. The politics of the Qing Dynasty were bad, so there was a revolution. How is the politics of the Republic compared to the Qing government? Children and wealth, good officials act for themselves. If the superiors are good, the inferiors are even worse, while industry and commerce are in difficulty, and the people's livelihood is declining and is ignored. Young people have no way out, and are forced to go to extremes. The government suppresses the Communists every day, but in fact creates Communists every day. Now we do not hope that the government will find a way out for young people, but we hope that it will not close their ears and eyes, so that they have no way to go, but open a line of life for them, so that young people feel that there is light and hope in the future, then it will bring great happiness. This is the second. Japan has seized the three northeastern provinces, as if entering no man's land. We have soldiers who do not defend against foreign aggression, and officials who do not defend the territory. This is truly a global and timeless wonder, and the Chinese people dare not say half a word of disagreement. The 19th Route Army defended against foreign aggression in Shanghai, although it washed away the shame of non-resistance and aroused the national spirit, the result was that the essence of Shanghai was exhausted." As Sun spoke, he sighed repeatedly. This also shows his sympathy for the feelings of abolishing civil war.</p>

<p>A Rice Riot in Xintang City: Xintang City, District 9 of this county, was occupied by the Japanese army for more than a month, and the people suffered heavy losses. On the 27th of last month, the China International Famine Relief Commission sent personnel to the countryside to distribute relief. They first contacted Zhou Tingzhen, the district head, at the district office. The matter was heard by the people, and the heads and deputy heads of six villages, including Liuyao Village, Louxia Village, and Zhujiangqiao Village, and more than a dozen people from the public, were publicly elected to request universal distribution, but to no avail. In the afternoon, hundreds of villagers from more than a dozen villages, together with the village heads and deputy heads, went to the district office again to petition, but still to no avail. Then, an unruly act occurred, resulting in the loss of seventy-two bags of relief rice. The county government believed that District Head Zhou Tingzhen's management was improper, causing the riot, and immediately dismissed him. The vacancy was temporarily filled by Xu Jingwei, an assistant at the district office.</p>

<p>A Fierce Battle between Police and Bandits in Xiangzhuang Town: Xiangzhuang Town, near Ganlu in District 11 of the county, is located at the intersection of Changzhou and Wuxi, about two li apart. On the first of this month, as dawn approached, a farmer named Zhou Qingsheng opened the door and went out to lead his ox. In the dim light of dawn, he saw five armed men, whose behavior was suspicious. He immediately questioned them. The soldiers suddenly opened fire, hitting Zhou Qingsheng in the back, the bullet exiting from his chest, and he fainted on the spot. At that time, the 7th Sub-bureau of the Ganlu Public Security Bureau heard the sound of gunfire and immediately dispatched inspectors led by Gu Yi, along with police officers, to pursue and capture them. Subsequently, because it was inconvenient to cross the boundary, they defended in the Wuxi area. However, at this time, the bandits had already lurked in the nearby wheat fields. Upon seeing the police officers, they opened fire and bombarded them. After the police officers bravely resisted, the area was surrounded by water on three sides, and the bandits were trapped. Then, they used a large grave as cover, and the two sides confronted each other for about an hour. Liu, the squad leader of the water police stationed in Ganlu, and Huang Liuchi, the platoon leader of the 3rd Company, 1st Battalion, 259th Brigade of the 87th Division stationed in Changshu, successively led the military police to come to help capture them and to inquire whether any deserters had passed by. Tu Nanxun, the platoon leader of the machine gun company of the regiment, also led his team from Xiangzhuang, At the same time, Ji Abing, a villager, sent two sets of military uniforms with symbols on them, belonging to soldiers of the 3rd Company, 1st Battalion, 518th Regiment of the 87th Division of the Army, saying that they were found next to a coffin. In total, from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM, the two sides opened fire, resulting in the death of five bandits, who were said to be deserters. In addition, three police officers, Pu Jinsheng, Qian Gengsheng, and He Xingsheng, were shot and killed by the bandits. Four villagers were also wounded by gunfire. Two soldiers of the machine gun company were also killed. All of this has been reported to the County Public Security Bureau and forwarded to the County Court for inspection. As for the wounded villagers, one named Shuang Nuannuan died from his injuries. Pan Gengquan was also seriously injured and is currently being treated at Puren Hospital. The other two, Zhou Wenbing and Zhou Qingsheng, father and son, are both being treated at the Brothers Hospital.</p>

Afterward, his family rescued him and took him home, where he died at dawn. One of the perpetrators was Jiang Afu, whom Huang Songxiang recognized when he was dying. Subsequently, the Baoan Corps went to Jiang's house to arrest him. The victim filed a report with the County Court and the County Government on the 3rd.

<p>City Schools in War Zones and Near War Zones Will Soon Be Restored</p>
<p>City Schools in Safe Zones and Rural Areas Have Not Been Greatly Affected</p>
<p>The consolidation and restoration of educational undertakings after the completion of the Shanghai war zone is extremely important. The Education News reporter visited the City Education Bureau yesterday to inquire about everything. The following is a summary: When the January 28th Incident occurred and the war was fierce, where the artillery fire reached, the villages and alleys were turned into ruins. The areas of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong were all turned into scorched earth. All industries were suspended, and the citizens fled. The city's revenue decreased sharply, and municipal construction was almost completely suspended invisibly. The City Education Bureau, in a helpless situation, tried to take care of both sides and distinguished between the safety of the regions, deliberated on the city's revenue, and formulated measures to extend the opening of primary and secondary schools in mid-February. Except for the municipal schools in the war zone and close to the war zone, which could not open, all other primary schools in the safe area and the rural areas behind the war zone were ordered to open as usual. However, primary schools with more grades and higher expenses were subject to separate maintenance measures. Secondary schools jointly found ways to maintain the opening. However, at that time, many citizens moved, and there were fewer students than usual. By the time the war shifted westward in mid-March, the Japanese army had occupied and not withdrawn from the three districts of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong, and the people had not moved back. Most of the buildings had been reduced to ashes. After the City Education Bureau presented it to the municipal government for approval, it had to temporarily suspend the operation of the municipal primary schools in the three districts and appointed custodians to manage the remaining school equipment in order to allocate and apply it to the overall planning and preparation for the restoration plan in the future. Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement, this entire restoration plan is still awaiting the deliberation and decision of the Shanghai War Zone Post-War Reconstruction Committee. Regarding the temporary consolidation plan, the City Education Bureau believes that the three districts have now been taken over, and the citizens are also moving back to their hometowns one after another. Primary school education cannot be delayed. Therefore, it has sent personnel to the war zone for on-the-spot investigation in the past few days to investigate the damage to the original school buildings of the various primary schools, the extent of the loss of school equipment, and the number of school-age children in the vicinity who are in urgent need of enrollment after the return of residents. It has been decided to formulate a temporary consolidation plan to repair and supplement the original school buildings in the three areas of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong in the shortest possible time, or to select suitable houses to establish temporary primary schools if the school buildings have been destroyed, in order to maintain the children's schooling. This plan will be implemented as soon as it is approved by the municipal government.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Library Revises Reading Methods <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>No Introduction or Certificate Required, Only One Copper Coin Charged</p>
<p>After the City Chamber of Commerce Library reopened as usual on April 1st, Director Sun Xinpan has been actively carrying out library affairs. In order to popularize reading, no introduction or reading certificate is required to enter the library for reading. Visitors only need to pay one copper coin to read any magazines and books on display. To borrow books outside the library, a deposit of two yuan and a handling fee of one yuan per year are required. After traffic in this city was restored last month, the Ministry's book delivery also resumed, with a delivery fee of only one yuan every six months. If one or two books are borrowed each week, the annual statistics can get a benefit of 100 yuan, so people from all walks of life are very active in visiting the library to read and borrow books. In April, a total of 3,849 books were borrowed, and in May, 7,551 books were borrowed, an increase of more than double. Therefore, it is also making unremitting efforts to solicit donations, deposits, and purchases. Since February, a total of more than 1,100 books and more than 1,200 magazines have been added. The librarians are working hard on registration, cataloging, and delivery work. It is learned that the library also needs to compile an index of commercial materials in various magazines for reference by all circles.</p>

<p>Liang Bingyuan is a young tennis star from Guangzhou with profound skills. He once held the Guangzhou Tennis Championship and is a famous player from Lingnan University. Mr. Liang came to Shanghai a few days ago for business reasons of his respected father who is a businessman in Shanghai. He will stay for the summer. Yesterday evening, he practiced with Lin Baohua and others at the China Tennis Court. His shots were quick and powerful. Judging from his skills, he is comparable to Zheng Zhaojia. He may show his skills in Shanghai's tennis matches. Yesterday, he teamed up with Jiang Daozhang for two practice sets.</p>

<p>Municipal Public Sports Field No. 1 had been closed since the January 28th Incident due to funding and martial law. Now that the situation has stabilized and citizens have returned to their homes, the field reopened as usual yesterday. Amateur athletes, like those who have longed for rain after a drought, came to the field one after another to exercise and build their bodies. The scene was quite lively. In addition, the fourth industrial and commercial amateur football competition organized by the field was suspended due to the war. As it is now summer, which is not very suitable for football matches, it is planned to resume the competition in winter.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Yesterday, Athletes from Six Groups Showed Their Skills, Mai Ling Overwhelms the Competition to Claim Championship <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>A Total of Eight First Place Finishes: Totaling Seventy-Seven Points</p>
<p>China Youth Ranked Second: Totaling Sixty-Six Points</p>
<p>Mai Ling's Performance Improved by Leaps and Bounds, China Youth Athletes Remained the Same</p>
<p>The sports meet of six groups, including China Youth, West Youth, Mai Ling, American Public, 31st Army, and Hai Qing, was held at the China Athletics Field yesterday afternoon starting at 1:30 PM. The audience reached three to four thousand people. Father Lao and Luton presented an extraordinary scene. The results of each event were remarkable. The discus, javelin, and twelve-pound shot put all broke the national record. As a result, Mai Ling won the championship with seventy-seven points. China Youth was eleven points behind, ranking second with sixty-six points. China Youth only won first place in four events, with the rest being taken by Mai Ling. The results of Mai Ling this time were beyond China Youth's expectations. It is especially regrettable that famous players such as Wang Jiwei and Hao Chunde fought hard but failed. However, the fact that our athletes remain the same makes it difficult to compete with others' rapid progress. Failure is not regrettable, we only hope for success in the future.</p>
<p>Scene at the Venue</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of track and field competitions. Enthusiastic sports fans were eager to see the skills of the athletes. In addition, the gates were wide open, with no tickets sold and no restrictions, so the audience gathered in large numbers, creating a grand scene. It was estimated that there were three to four thousand people. Although there were no fences or other obstacles around the field, the audience was able to maintain order, which was commendable. However, it was probably due to the presence of foreign soldiers and the stern faces of Western staff members that this was achieved. It is hoped that in future sports meets held by Chinese people, the audience will cherish and maintain order as they did yesterday.</p>
<p>Military Band Entertainment</p>
<p>Although yesterday's gathering was somewhat hasty, there was one very interesting thing: the famous Mai Ling military band, which is renowned in Shanghai, came to the venue to perform. The scene at the venue was greatly enhanced. In the uplifting sound of the military music, the audience clapped and danced (the audience often tapped their feet to the music), and the athletes were also inspired and invigorated. However, the band left together at 3 o'clock, which was a bit disappointing.</p>
<p>Hurdles Regret</p>
<p>During the hurdles final, Xiao Dinghua and Henry came to compete fiercely. Xiao took the lead all the way and seemed likely to win the championship. At the last hurdle, Xiao was still in the lead, but in the final sprint, Xiao was defeated by Henry. Henry only took the lead by an inch when touching the line, relying entirely on his skillful touch. Xiao lost because he was not good at touching the line. This is truly a great experience for Xiao. He can improve in the future.</p>
<p>Total Scores of Each Team</p>
<p>First: Mai Ling: 77 points Second: China Youth: 66 points</p>
<p>Third: Allied Forces: 17 points Fourth: Hai Qing: 9 points</p>
<p>Fifth: West Youth: 3.5 points Fifth: American Public: 3.5 points</p>
<p>Four First Place Finishes</p>
<p>China Youth only won four first place finishes in all events. In addition to the Naval Youth Association winning first place in one high jump event, the rest were all taken by Mai Ling. The results of China Youth were: Cheng Jinguan, 200m low hurdles, 28.5 3/5 seconds; He Debao, 400m, 54.5 4/5 seconds; Lu Yaxiong, triple jump, 42 feet 2.5 inches; Hu Jinqi, high jump, 5 feet 5.5 inches. The results were the same as before and did not improve.</p>
<p>Individual Scores</p>
<p>Mai Ling's Shi Huanke scored a total of eleven points, ranking first in the individual total score. His results were also very outstanding. In addition, Mai Ling's Tang Shilie and Shatun each scored ten points, tying for second place. On the China Youth side, the highest scorer was Lu Yaxiong with seven points, and Xiao Dinghua with six points. Others such as Wang Jihuai and Hao Chunde encountered opponents, resulting in defeat.</p>
<p>Key to Victory or Defeat</p>
<p>During the course of the various sports events, China Youth's score increased steadily, leading Mai Ling, and it was thought that the championship could be secured. When there were only three events remaining, the javelin, pole vault, and relay race, China Youth was leading by five points. However, Mai Ling scored a total of seven points in the javelin, while China Youth only got one point. Mai Ling scored another eight points in the pole vault, while China Youth got two points. In the relay race, China Youth lost to Mai Ling by six to ten. In these three events, China Youth lost to Mai Ling by nine to twenty-five, losing a total of sixteen points. Subtracting the previous five-point lead, they were instead behind by eleven points. Mai Ling turned defeat into victory and must have been overjoyed. However, the China Youth athletes were not discouraged by the defeat.</p>
<p>Special Records</p>
<p>The best track and field results were Mai Ling's Tang Shilie's 200m in 23.5 1/5 seconds and Mai Ling's Shatun's 800m in 2 minutes and 10 seconds. All three throwing events set special records and exceeded the national record. For example, Mai Ling's Glen's discus reached 124 feet 1 inch, which is about 38 meters in the metric system. The best result in China was only over 36 meters at the North China Games in Jinan last year. Mai Ling's Hunterson's javelin had a result of 148 feet 5 feet, which is about 48 meters in the metric system. The highest score in our country is only about 46 meters. In addition, the Allied Forces' Hieles' twelve-pound shot put measured 47 feet 6 inches, about 14 meters, which is similar to the highest record occasionally achieved by Pan Zuoxin the year before last. Our athletes must strive to encourage themselves and strive for progress.</p>
<p>China Youth Athletes</p>
<p>Looking at the China Youth athletes, they still maintain their previous records, with no progress or regression. Although they suffered a defeat this time, it was because the results of the Mai Ling athletes were beyond the reach of our athletes, so there is no resentment in defeat. However, the complete defeat in the 800 meters and Xiao Dinghua's leg injury are regrettable and have some impact on the total score.</p>

<p>Fifteen</p>
<p>We walked to the entrance of the Normal School. Old Madam Song told the gatekeeper, "We are here to ask for a teacher and want to see the Principal." The gatekeeper said, "The Principal has not yet arrived. Please wait here for a while." Listen! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. This thing rings 'dang, dang, dang' by itself. Old Madam Song said, "This is a self-ringing clock!" What a self-ringing clock! I have long admired its name, and I am so happy to meet it today. We waited and waited, and waited again, until we became impatient, and then we walked inside to take a look. There were thirty or so students sitting in a room. Some words were written on the blackboard, and a gentleman in a suit was teaching the students to read them. The words written on the blackboard did not look like Chinese characters, but the sounds could be clearly distinguished. Everyone was chanting in unison with the teacher, "Ai, Bi, Xi, Di: : :" Old Madam Song said, "They are learning foreign languages." We walked to another identical room, and we could only hear everyone shouting, "Wang, Tu, Si Li: : :" How interesting! Unheard of. Old Madam Song said that we don't need this stuff in the countryside. But I dare not be so dogmatic. Old Madam Song seemed not to like foreign languages very much. She spoke softly in my ear: "Ai, Bi, Xi, Di,</p>
<p>Wang, Tu, Si Li,</p>
<p>Chinese people are farting foreign words."</p>
<p>Haha! Chun Sheng asked us why we were laughing. I told him, and he couldn't help but laugh too.</p>
<p>The bell rang ten times, and the Principal arrived, looking very much like a county magistrate. We explained our purpose and asked him to introduce a really good and capable teacher to go to the countryside. He said, "We have three graduates. I will write a letter to call one to meet with you. Please come back at this time tomorrow." Old Madam Liao was very happy to hear that there were three. She wanted to see all three and then choose one from among them. She was used to using this method to choose a son-in-law. But she was rejected by the Principal. The Principal said, "I will choose the best one to talk to you first. If you think he is very good, he can go to the countryside. If you don't think he is good, I will introduce someone else later." Old Madam Song knew that her method of choosing a son-in-law could not be applied here, so she did not insist. We nodded to the Principal and said goodbye.</p>
<p>There was no hope of going to the countryside today. Old Madam Song took us to play at her sister's house. Her nephew, Young Master Wu, insisted on inviting us to a restaurant to eat big dishes. I guessed it was stewed pork with cabbage, but later I learned that it was foreign food. This meal was actually more strenuous than carrying water. I guessed that Young Master Wu was an expert in eating big dishes, so I carefully learned from him. He used a spoon to drink soup, and I also used a spoon to drink soup. He used a knife to cut meat and a fork to eat it, and I also used a knife to cut meat and a fork to eat it. He didn't move his hands, and I didn't dare to move my hands either. Strange! He drank soup as quietly as a monk eating porridge. So I didn't dare to make any noise when drinking soup either. But Brother Chun Sheng was different. He didn't pay attention to learning from Young Master Wu. He drank soup almost as loudly as an old cow drinking water. He also made a big joke that made everyone's stomachs hurt from laughing. He used a knife to put meat into his mouth to eat. Carelessly, he stabbed his tongue with the knife. I only heard him cry "Ouch!" and he spit out all the food in his mouth. Blood was still dripping and dripping non-stop. It was truly:</p>
<p>"Country bumpkin,</p>
<p>eating big dishes.</p>
<p>Using the knife as chopsticks.</p>
<p>Oh my God!</p>
<p>A piece of the tongue is gone."</p>

<p>When I was in Japan as a Counselor at the Embassy, it was during the tenure of Minister Li Chunzhai (i.e., Shuchang).</p>
<p>Before becoming a Minister, Li Chunzhai submitted a ten-thousand-word memorial to the Military Affairs Yamen, and the Military Affairs Yamen issued it to Zeng Guofan for use in the camp. Who knew that when Li Chunzhai saw Zeng Guofan, Zeng Guofan told him to "read the Records of the Grand Historian." So Li Chunzhai read the Records of the Grand Historian in the camp, and he read it for more than ten years. This can also be considered a joke.</p>
<p>When I was in Japan, not only did Westerners look down on Japan, but we Chinese also looked down on Japan. At that time, foreigners criticized Japan for having "three nones," which were:</p>
<p>Men have no integrity,</p>
<p>Women have no sense of shame,</p>
<p>Flowers have no fragrance.</p>
<p>Not only did we look down on Japanese men and women, but we also looked down on Japanese flowers and plants. At that time, I was a dignified Counselor at the Chinese Embassy in Japan, and the famous Ito was just a chief in the Ministry. I didn't even know the name of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, who was recently assassinated!</p>

<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>War, we acknowledge it as a terrifying demon. Wherever it goes, there is death and bloodshed. Wherever it points, there is plague, homelessness, and no harvest. At the same time, that great demon, "hunger," follows closely behind.</p>
<p>This time, the Battle of Shanghai has caused such devastation to the war zone directly affected that we don't know when we can restore it to its former state.</p>
<p>However, according to the report of the Post-War Relief Committee of Jiangsu,</p>
<p>The urgent need now is to provide relief to those war-torn people who are homeless, without clothing, and without food. Just to build thatched houses, restore farmlands, and improve irrigation, at least 300,000 yuan will be needed. And the area it covers is only six counties, namely Dachang, Jiading, Baoshan, Kunshan, Biaopu, and Changshu, which suffered the greatest damage.</p>
<p>In Dachang, 168 people were sacrificed, and 381 houses were destroyed. In Jiading, more than 100 people died, and 643 houses were burned down. As for the rest, at least 100,000 yuan will be needed for the construction of temporary houses, and the cost of purchasing seeds alone will probably be more than 80,000 yuan. Otherwise, if we do not remedy the situation quickly, next year we will face a situation where there is no rice to eat and no seeds to plant. The year of great famine and disaster will be upon us.</p>

<p>Wang Gongxia, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the Military Police stationed in Wuxi, is an optimistic revolutionary. He has a very fresh mind and is very frank in his words and actions. Because he is good at laughing, his colleagues gave him the nickname "Happy General."</p>
<p>One day, this interesting Happy General sent out a large number of invitations, writing on them that at a certain time on a certain day, please come to a certain restaurant for a dinner party.</p>
<p>His lover, Ms. Hu Kuang, also invited many of her friends and relatives, saying that at a certain time on a certain day, please come to a certain restaurant for a meal.</p>
<p>At the appointed time, their friends and relatives all arrived at the largest dining room of a certain restaurant. This dining room was divided into two rooms by a large screen. On one side of the room, the sign read "Mr. Wang's Banquet," and on the other side, the sign read "Ms. Hu's Banquet." When the banquet was halfway through, a armed comrade suddenly removed the screen, reconnecting the two rooms into one large room. The guests on both sides looked at each other, bewildered. After a moment, this armed comrade suddenly jumped onto the table and announced to the crowd, "Today is the auspicious day for Mr. Wang Gongxia and Ms. Hu Kuang. They have studied love for many years and decided to get married today. Because this is a memorable day for the beginning of a new life, we have specially invited you to come and enjoy yourselves." At this time, the group of friends who had come to the dinner party without knowing why suddenly realized and uttered a sound of "Ah!" in unison. Thus, this most modern and comical comedy was announced to be completed.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Talking About Shad <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yuan</p>
<p>Reading my friend Zheng Yimei's notes on "Shad of the Fuchun River" occasionally touched my feelings. I also have some stories about shad. I will write them down in a disorganized way to promote this seasonal fish.</p>
<p>Shad is produced in the river. Every year during the plum rain season, silver scales churn at the head of the Yangtze River. Fishermen cast their nets in the river, catch them, and sell them. Because shad is a seasonal fish, it is only produced in April and May. After this time, it disappears without a trace. The nature of the shad is the same as that of marine fish. It dies immediately when it leaves the water and is difficult to store for long. Therefore, the price of fresh shad is twice as high as that of ordinary fish.</p>
<p>In Jiangsu Province, the area that produces shad is only in the Yangtze River in Zhenjiang and Qiyakou, Changshu. Therefore, those who eat fresh shad usually go to the Yangtze River, wait for the shad to come out, and then cook and eat it. In the past, my old friend Xie Yichang once went to the Yushan Monastery in Zhenjiang to taste the flavor of fresh shad, saying that the fresh shad was fat and delicious, and it was a great pleasure to eat it. Now, the season of plum rain is here again, and the old friend has been away for a long time. Looking up at the sky, I wonder if my old friend also has this feeling.</p>
<p>In Wu, it is customary to give food gifts to relatives and friends during festivals to strengthen friendships. However, due to the emphasis on reciprocity, there are many people with extensive social circles and old friends and relatives. It is impossible to give fresh items to everyone. Often, what is received from A is given to B, and B's items are returned to A. Gifts are exchanged back and forth as festival gifts. During the Dragon Boat Festival, silver-scaled shad fish and zongzi are indispensable festival gifts. However, shad is a light fish that cannot be stored for long, and the price is high. How can those who give gifts buy fresh fish for everyone? As a result, stinky and spoiled shad fish are still given back and forth among relatives and friends, becoming a reward for maids. Therefore, there is a saying that "giving rotten shad fish to people" in the past. Now, the standard of living has increased, and this kind of false custom of giving festival gifts has been somewhat reduced compared to the past. It is unlikely that there will be another "giving rotten shad fish to people" event in society.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I often talked about ruining the scenery with Mr. Cheng Xiaoqing and others. "Cooking shad without scales" and "building a building behind a mountain," "washing feet in a clear stream," and "talking about rice and salt with a beautiful woman" are all things that destroy the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Shad is produced in the river. When it enters the sea, it is called shad. Therefore, the shape and taste of shad and shad are similar. However, shad is especially fresh and palatable. Because "shad has many thorns and carp has a sour taste," it is a regret for gourmets. I don't know that shad is delicious because it has many thorns, just like a beautiful woman can only satisfy the eyes. For those who only eat meat, they cannot appreciate its charm.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Talking About Epidemic Prevention After the War <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Guhong</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "After a great war, there will be a great epidemic." When armies are at war, there is bloodshed. After decay and evaporation, epidemics will be bred and spread without end. This time, the violent Japanese invaded our city, burned our houses, and massacred our people. The bodies of the victims were not buried properly. The organic matter contained in them produces various cadaveric poisons through the action of bacteria. The toxins are very strong and spread through the air to the human body, causing death.</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has gradually become hot and the air is dry, making the harm even more severe. Therefore, we should work together to prevent it as soon as possible. The most effective way is to purchase disinfectant and spray it everywhere in the residence to eliminate the germs and prevent the epidemic. The best choice for disinfectant is Yalin Disinfectant produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy. Yalin disinfectant is made of pure ingredients and manufactured with care, with strong bactericidal power. Moreover, it is entirely made in China.</p>

<p>Mr. Yu Youren's eyes are higher on the left and lower on the right. His beard is about eight points longer than Mr. Wen Lantings beard and twice as long as Mr. Tianxu Wushengs.</p>
<p>Lawyer Li Zuyu's forehead is very similar to that of Mr. Hu Hanmin, who is in seclusion in Guangdong.</p>
<p>After Mr. Chu Minyi grew a beard, he looked like Fan Pengke in the movie The Thief Robin Hood at first glance.</p>
<p>Many people suspect that Ms. Xue, the wife of Zhang Huichang, and Ms. Yu Danhan, the painter, are two sisters. Mr. Lu Feibos head is the same size as Mr. Wang Yunwus head. They are both as big as winter melons. The wonder is that both of them are managers of bookstores.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Lianfang, the former vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, and the current German Chancellor Bruning, although they grew up in the East and West, have the same appearance.</p>

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The Chinese people doubt the meaning of "long-term resistance" and think that these four words are deceptive! In fact, "long-term resistance" does have great effectiveness, but we must distinguish clearly. Some people use it as a verbal advertisement; some people practice it diligently, like the unyielding and courageous Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, which is a true "national salvation army" of long-term resistance, and also a "savior" for recovering lost territory. Our hope is so extravagant, so we must fully meet their material needs, food and military supplies. However, I think there are two things that are disappointing recently: (1) the assistance from all walks of life to the Northeast Volunteer Army is not as enthusiastic as before; (2) the anti-Japanese movement in various places is gradually declining. Alas! Is this phenomenon the slavishness of the Chinese nation? I want to ask the Chinese people.</p>

<p>— Haike</p>
<p>In Salonica, northeastern Greece, there was a lawsuit. An important witness in the case, according to the plaintiff, had already died. The judge ordered him to present a death certificate to prove it. The plaintiff had no choice but to go to the man's grave, dig up the tombstone, and carry it to the court to prove that the man was indeed dead.</p>
<p>In Warsaw, Poland, a young couple came out of the church after getting married. They looked at each other and smiled, and walked slowly shoulder to shoulder. Suddenly, a woman on the side of the road gave them a basket, saying it was a small gift. They accepted it. When they opened it at the wedding banquet, it was a cute baby.</p>
<p>Among the accessories worn by women in British social circles at night, a necklace of fresh flowers has recently become popular. Countless fresh and colorful flowers are woven together. Each necklace costs about five to fifteen shillings, which is ten thousand times more economical than a diamond necklace. However, it must be changed twice every night, because it is difficult to look good when it is wilted.</p>
<h3 id="e131">On the Idea of National Salvation Through Thrift (Part 2) <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Narrated by Nie Zeng Jifen, Written by Her Son, Qijie</p>
<p>Later, while at the Liangjiang Governor-General's office, my late father always wanted to maintain a semblance of rural life. He forbade the use of silk for everyday clothing. One day, a guest arrived, and I was wearing a feathered gauze jacket, slightly torn. After the guest left, Duke Wenzheng entered and gazed at it. He asked my mother, "Why is the Manchu girl's clothing so fancy?" My mother quickly replied, "She only wore it for the guest. Feathered gauze is a foreign product, thin and rough in quality, cheaper than serge, and even cheaper than Huzhou crepe. The torn part is Nanjing-woven, only thirty cash per foot. She usually wears this jacket with a cloth vest. When guests arrive, she takes off the vest." My late father set a rule that the expenses for daughters' marriages were limited to 200 gold pieces. The clothing was limited to two boxes, and gold jewelry to two pieces: a flat hairpin and an ear pick. Everything was within these 200 gold pieces. We spun yarn, weaved hemp, sewed, and cooked, with daily assignments. My late father personally inspected our work, leaving us almost no free time. In the past, women's shoes and socks, regardless of wealth, were mostly self-made. We also had to make shoes for our father and brothers as part of our tasks. I continued the spinning work until I was over forty years old, when I lived in the judicial commissioner's office with my late son-in-law. Later, I switched to using a sewing machine. For the past twenty years, this machine has always been placed beside me. Now, at eighty-one, I still enjoy needlework, all thanks to the benefits of the training I received in my youth. The reason I am describing these trivial matters is that the trends of extravagance or thrift in society are initiated by a small number of people. The wives and daughters of nobles are the worst instigators of luxury, often causing trouble for their husbands' conduct and careers. Therefore, my late father was so strict with us. Having received such education early on, I have made it a lifelong habit. I often choose outdated fabrics because they are cheaper. I remember in the year of Jiawu (1894), while at the Shanghai Daotai's office, my late sister-in-law, the wife of Zeng Huimin, came to the office. Seeing the lace I had bought, which had an old-fashioned design, she said, "No one uses this anymore. The current popular foreign lace has fresh and beautiful colors, ten times better than this." I replied, "I have seen it and even bought it for others. However, the price is several times higher than this. Although what I bought is outdated, I like it, and I am happy that the money stays in China and does not flow abroad." My sister-in-law laughed and said, "How much can you save by yourself?" I said, "Even so, if everyone could think this way, or if the Empress Dowager could see this and not love foreign goods and trinkets, then much would be saved."</p>

<p>— Owner of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Special Train Escapes Guests with False Alarm; Sitting in the Cold Office Turns into Distant Thoughts</p>
<p>It is said that An Yutian, in the compartment, nearly fell when he stepped down to take the seat Ye Zuozhang had offered him, missing the floor. In that critical moment of shock, fortunately, Mao Deshun quickly reached out from behind and helped him, preventing him from making a fool of himself in public. However, a teacup on the shelf in front of him had been knocked over, and tea was dripping. His actions were frivolous and lacked decorum. After sitting down, he couldn't help but blush, feel his heart pound, and deeply regret his recklessness. Ye Zuozhang, on the other hand, was magnanimous and didn't mind at all. He allowed the attendants to wipe up the tea stains and still asked An Yutian questions with a smiling face. At first, he only asked about common things like his place of origin and education, which An Yutian could easily answer. This allowed him to slowly calm down and secretly observe Ye Zuozhang's demeanor. Although he was short in stature, his spirit was very vibrant. His eyes were bright and piercing, seeming to possess immense authority. His speech was loud and clear, his words humorous and quirky, both rough and charming. When he mentioned Liang Xiaoyun, he even patted An Yutian on the shoulder and said, "You are more fortunate to marry such a good wife than I am to be a military governor! Why did you still come to me? But since Xiaoyun Lao Ba recommended you, someone he appreciates must certainly be without fault. How could I not rely on you?" Having said that, he shook his monkey-like head and laughed heartily. The laughter made An Yutian's hair stand on end. He suddenly thought, "Isn't he clearly laughing at me as a 'soft rice king' who relies entirely on connections through women to seek official position? So he dares to treat me as a source of amusement and openly insult me. According to the principle that a scholar can be killed but not humiliated, I must show him some integrity!" Immediately, this feeling of anger dispelled the shyness and embarrassment he had felt earlier. He straightened his back with righteous indignation and said, "That is a personal love affair and not worth mentioning. I came to see the military governor because I have long heard that the governor is enthusiastic about bringing benefits to the region and needs talented people to help. Therefore, I introduced myself to the governor and proposed an idea for clearing out bandits and pacifying the people. I am willing to have my humble opinion adopted and put into action, so that I can say what I can do and do what I say. I can quickly organize those bandits and militias that have been in contact for a long time into elite troops to serve the country. Once the banditry in the region is cleared, the governor can expand his strength. I will repay the governor and my fellow villagers, fulfilling my lifelong ambition. That is the greatest happiness!" Although this speech was delivered with great vigor, its meaning was still disjointed and not necessarily impressive.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Gold Price Falls 4.5 Taels <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The market is peaceful. Spot gold continues to decline slightly, the situation is peaceful, the market only fluctuated by four taels, and the result has fallen by four taels and five qian. The initial weakness was seen within 720 taels, as the silver market rebounded. Subsequently, there were slight fluctuations, but only by one or two taels. Transactions varied among different firms, but sentiment was low, likely due to the stabilization of the British exchange rate and the easing of the US exchange rate, which led to a continued rise in exchange rates. Ultimately, the selling side prevailed, leading to weakness, with a final price of 715 taels and change. Due to the upcoming weekend market closure, only five days of trading occurred this week, and the market conditions were complex. The price once broke below 710 taels, due to a large outflow of cash from the United States and various unfavorable news regarding the silver conference, which affected the market. On Thursday, the price was only 701 taels and five qian. On Friday, it reached 23 taels and eight qian, and then there was a possibility of a large-scale rise, showing signs of short covering.

Furthermore, Zhifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Yuanmao, and Yongdeng had only average transactions recently, with a volume still around 23,000 contracts.

Large contracts for the near term remained unchanged, while forward contracts rose by 1/16, and the silver price increased by 1/8. The spot market was mediocre and quiet, hence the lower opening.

<p>Yesterday, the silver market rebounded, and exchange rates continued to rise. However, the Shanghai market remained relatively stable. HSBC's listed prices for British, American, and Hong Kong dollars showed no changes, with only the French franc increasing by one yuan and the German exchange rate increasing by 0.25. Internally, British exchange rates were stable and American exchange rates were loose. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British gold price was the same, while the American dollar increased by 0.125. However, the gold price had already fallen by more than four taels, so the trend seemed to be downward. Transactions in all directions were limited, with only a few British gold transactions and approximately 300,000 to 400,000 US dollars in transactions. Gold businesses and speculators slightly covered their short positions, while Citibank and Indian merchants made some sales. Mobil Oil made settlements on forward contracts. In the afternoon, due to the weekend market closure, a comprehensive review of the week showed some changes. The US dollar was roughly even in the near term, while the forward rate increased by 0.1875. The swap rate was relatively high, while the British gold rate was openly released by one level, with no noticeable change in the dark. The transactions of yesterday are recorded below:</p>

<p>Market Overview: Yesterday morning, when foreign exchange trading began, it should have declined. However, due to slight active buying by banks, although there were extremely strong sellers, there was ultimately no significant difference in supply and demand, and there was no major change. However, in the afternoon market, buying interest was stagnant, and prices fell again. This shows that the long-term decline is not easy to recover in a short time. Since the overall settlement, the amount of concentrated funds is quite abundant. The situation of the day will not be firmly high, and the auxiliary coins will change with the rise and fall of interest rates, which seems to be no problem.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices: The supply of "foreign interest rates" was particularly strong in the early market. However, due to bank purchases, the situation finally remained unchanged at six qian nine fen seven li, the same as the previous morning. The afternoon market continued to decline by a small two hao and a half, to six qian nine fen six li seven hao and a half. The "silver interest rate" remained the same for both the early and afternoon markets at two fen, and there was no market for additional water.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Coin Market Conditions: Due to the scarcity of transactions, the Jiangnan small coins remained unchanged. The prices for both the early and afternoon markets were the same at six qian zero one li, with only 2,000 jiao traded in the early market. The Guangdong small coins were also the same in both the early and afternoon markets at five qian nine fen two li two hao and a half, a slight decrease of two hao and a half compared to the previous day's afternoon market. 95,000 jiao were traded in the early market and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by 1,500 characters, to 422,500 characters.</p>

<p>Transaction Volume Over 4 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday (4th), the market conditions of various bonds at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the spot market of the Qing Dynasty, only opened 39,300 yuan for the whole day, and the futures market was also as flat as before, and the market popularity was generally not deserted. The previous market was more prosperous, with a total of more than 2.3 million yuan opened, and the latter market was only 1.7 million yuan, totaling 4.04 million yuan, of which unified salt tax, 20 customs, and volume were about 700,000 yuan each, and demobilization 19 customs Shan was 3-400,000 yuan each, and the others were still relatively clear. As for the changes in the prices of various bonds, when the morning market opened, the market was lively with demand, and the buying momentum was strong, so although the selling was also enthusiastic, the price was quite strong. In the second round of buying, the momentum turned calm, and the selling side dominated, and the price unanimously returned low. The demand and supply of the two markets in the later market were also flat, and the price hovered without major ups and downs. As a result, the previous day, such as 20 customs, volume, 19 Shan, salt tax, etc., were each small by 5-6 Jiao, and the others had mutual ups and downs, and the number was about 2-3 Jiao. The situation of the bond is again chaotic.</p>

<p>(Report by Meidong Bank Company)</p>
<p>During this week, the New York stock market was mostly waiting for news from Washington in the first few days, and the market once plummeted. After that, good news was frequently reported, and the price gradually rebounded. The market on Friday was several points higher than on Monday. The average price of industrial stocks on Tuesday was 44.74, because the White House and the Senate could not understand each other for a while on the sales tax bill. On Wednesday, the Senate finally passed the bill, and people felt relieved. The biggest problem has been solved, and people are becoming active. The most important step is the cooperative maintenance of bond prices by the banking industry. This step is progressing quite rapidly. The rebound of the securities market on Thursday is due to this. On Friday, reliable news was received that the underwriting of public bonds by the banking industry has reached 100 million yuan. It is now expected that major banks in New York will form a group to jointly maintain credit, and Morgan Bank will serve as the agency. This move has a very close impact on the securities market. The will of the trading community seems to be unanimous. In the past week, daily transactions have reached 1.7 million shares, which shows the enthusiasm of the people. This trend has a great help for general industry and commerce. Based on this, it is said that the market in the first few days of this week has reached the lowest level, which is not without reason. The Dow Jones index this week is on the left,</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market is gradually moving towards a soft trend. Due to the sluggishness of the world yarn market and the low price of raw materials, the yarn market is fundamentally loose. Therefore, some people are slightly selling future yarn, but buyers believe that the demand in the southern ports is still uninterrupted, and many brands of existing yarn are in short supply, and the pulling force is still strong. However, the surrounding environment is very deteriorating. As for the economic situation in all directions, it is extremely exhausted, the countryside is tired, and the general situation is very depressed. The actual sales period is gradually entering the off-season, and the future is difficult to stabilize. It can still be maintained for a while.</p>
<p>People's Standard Drops Both Outside: The People's Standard opened in the previous market. As American cotton fell again, there was a lack of buyers in the market, and each month fell 6.7.8.9. Qian. In the afternoon, I heard that actual sales were not smooth, and people's hearts were soft again, and each month fell 5.6.7.8.Qian. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 15,750 packages. It was found that Da Ji sold 1,200 packages, Rongxing 800 packages, Minghua 400 packages, and Renfeng 700 packages. Guangfeng bought 2,000 packages, Yiyu 500 packages, Yichang 1,100 packages, and Yuantai 400 packages. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton market is very tired, and the decline is getting more and more serious. As American cotton fell, and at the same time, spot merchants saw that the world cotton market was depressed, and the needs of various factories were blocked, and they were all occupied by foreign cotton. Therefore, the idea of selling short is even more important. It is heard that the trading company has sold short another 7,000 dan, and the market is even more difficult to support. It is found that a certain factory in Ningbo is the most, about 12,000 dan. However, with the calculation of foreign cotton prices, this cotton is in a state of eternal doom.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Fell 4-5 Qian: Zheng Standard opened in the previous market. As American cotton fell again, the market was very tired, and there was a lack of buyers in the market, and each line fell 4-5 Qian. The afternoon was flat. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 36,500 dan. It was found that Suilong sold 3,000 dan, Gengfeng 3,100 dan, Shenchang 800 dan, Dachang 1,100 dan, Yuantai 900 dan, and Yida 1,400 dan.

<p>Foreign Firms Try Their Best to Sell Foreign Cotton: The current cotton transaction is extremely quiet. However, foreign cotton firms are trying their best to sell in the market, and the price is extremely willing to compromise. However, manufacturers see the world situation as bad, and they are all at a loss.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was mixed. Later, it was tired due to the downturn in Wall Street and the good cotton harvest. The futures fell 12-13 pounds, and the spot fell 15 pounds. British cotton futures rose 9-11 points, and the spot rose 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose 5 points, and Indian cotton stopped trading.

New cotton production is progressing well. It is heard that the fruit borer is gradually increasing, and the number of cotton fields has been reduced by about 7%.</p>

<p>Cocoon Merchants Few, Cocoon Prices Low</p>
<p>Farmers Drying Cocoons Themselves</p>
<p>In Jiangning and surrounding rural areas, the number of silkworm farmers this year is only 20-30% of last year's. However, in the villages near the city, improved breeds distributed by silkworm breeding societies are being cultivated, and graduates from silkworm schools are providing guidance. Therefore, although the weather has been unfavorable, the damage has not been significant, and the cocoon yield is still good. However, the cocoon exchanges have not been leased out, and only one or two merchants are buying at suppressed prices. The farmers' costs are not low, and they are generally unwilling to sell cheaply. The highest cocoon price is only a little over 20 yuan, and the lowest is only 14 or 15 yuan. Farmers are mostly taking them back to dry themselves using traditional methods, or pooling funds to entrust cocoon merchants to dry them on their behalf, in order to spin their own native silk. Thus, it is said that the cocoon market has effectively ceased operations.</p>

<p>The excellent natural qualities of the leaf base of Zhenmei tea from eastern Wuyuan have always been praised by Indian merchants. Recently, however, disturbances and riots in Bombay have occurred frequently, seriously impacting the Chinese tea trade with India. Therefore, after Wuyuan Zhenmei Gongxi green tea arrived in Shanghai last week, merchants were mostly hesitant and dared not start trading. It was recently heard that Zhenmei from that area has been opened at 133 taels by Baitou merchants, but no transaction has been recorded. Gongxi opened between 80 and 86 taels. Zhenmei is 50-60 taels lower than last year, and Gongxi is 10-20 taels lower. Chinese tea merchants suffer significant losses due to the high original cost. Transactions in Zhenmei and Needle-like tea from Tunxi and Sui'an, etc., continue to be brisk, and market prices are unchanged from previous days. Qimen black tea is seeing great activity in the market because the British firm Jinlong Yanghang has already begun large-scale purchases.</p>

<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday in the rice market, the source from the western route was the 23rd and 24th. There was not much inventory in the wharves and warehouses. Urban and rural shops, due to the weather turning clear, were unwilling to take in more. Northern japonica rice opened early in the market and the price was set. In the afternoon, the price per shi rose considerably, increasing by one or two jiao. Fresh early and late rice also followed, increasing by one jiao or so. "Luyang Jian" rice still followed the original rate.</p>
<p>Zhabei Yesterday: Approximately 30 ships arrived from inland areas. The city's trade was initially sluggish, then became active. Changshu and Wuxi northern japonica rice, as well as Kunshan rice, rose by nearly one jiao. Thin rice and early rice had slightly higher warehouse prices, following the previous rate. The demand for foreign Luyang Jian and glutinous rice was scarce, showing a downward trend. The total amount of river cargo for the two markets before and after amounted to 3,500-3,600 shi.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Imported Rice Continues to Decline <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>A newly arrived ship with a scheduled delivery: A few merchants from Hubei attempted a small transaction.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for imported rice from both local and out-of-town buyers was weak. For the past few days, merchants from inland areas have been waiting and watching. Only this street continued to offer it in minimal amounts. The market situation continued to soften, and the price decreased slightly by six or seven fen. However, due to the market price decline, Hubei merchants gradually saw a suitable point and attempted a small transaction of 300 bags. This slightly stabilized the market. The overall market opened with 500 bags of Xiaojiao rice, priced at 10 yuan, 8 jiao and a half to 7 jiao; 1,000 bags of Min Dang rice, priced at 11 yuan to 10 yuan and 9 jiao; and 200 bags of Saigon No. 1, priced at 11 yuan and 9 jiao and a half. Except for the bags bought by Hubei merchants, all were taken by local rural households.</p>
<p>It is expected that foreign firms will continue to peddle imported rice, but without any takers, there will be no transactions, and prices will continue to decline. A new ship with a scheduled delivery of Xiaojiao rice has arrived and is scheduled to dock and unload today. The number is estimated to be around 40,000 to 50,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Futures Market Resumes; First Act - Uniform Price Drop Across All Months <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures flour market officially resumed trading. The trading in both markets was quite lively. Because of the good weather, the price of foreign wheat also decreased by about three jiao. In addition, actual sales were sluggish, and the manufacturers' inventories remained as abundant as before. When trading opened last year, the price for July was 2 taels and 2 fen. Later, manufacturers such as Fuxin and Fufeng sold off their inventory, and confidence waned. For this reason, the prices for August and September gradually trended downward. The opening prices for October and November were flat at first, but then showed improvement as customers bought in small amounts. However, when trading opened in the afternoon, the market sentiment fluctuated greatly. Compared to the morning prices, the price continued to fall by about 2 fen. The reason for the decline is that manufacturers indicated that they would sell as much as possible based on the July standard, intending to clear their inventories to prepare for the smooth entry of new wheat. As a result, people panicked, and the market showed a continuous downward trend. The total price drop between the opening and closing prices for July and August was 3 fen and 2.5 li, for September it was 2 fen and 2.5 li, and for October and November it was 1 fen. The total number of transactions was 364,000 bags.</p>

<p>Prices of New and Old Goods Fluctuate Differently</p>
<p>As the weather has gradually become warmer in recent days, the trade in woolen fabrics has gradually decreased. Only summer and white goods are currently selling well. Yesterday, there was a great need for feathersatin from buyers. The Guild's wholesale was also substantial, purchased by local merchants. Furthermore, newly arrived feathersatin was selling better. Most ordinary brands were priced at more than 3 taels, as their quality was superior and suitable for Western clothing. Old-stock plaid and striped feathersatin were also selling very briskly in the market, and the prices were extremely cheap. Yesterday, Xinyi goods sold for 1 tael and 8 qian, Hengli for 1 tael and 6 qian and a half. Other miscellaneous brands of plaid and striped goods were selling for only 1 tael and 5 or 6 qian per yard.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Metals: British Galvanized Iron - Thick Gauges in Demand; Thin Gauges Lack Sales <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The market for British galvanized iron had previously been weak due to an oversupply of goods and enthusiastic arrivals, resulting in a decline in standards. For example, No. 24 was estimated at 9 taels and 2.5 qian per dan, No. 26 at 10 taels and 0.25 qian, No. 28 at 11 taels, 9 qian for 3.7 chi and 7 qian and 8 fen for 3.6 chi. However, there were few buyers. In recent days, the business of out-of-town merchants has suddenly flourished, and the buying and selling of local construction merchants has also been very good. As a result, there are not enough goods in the market to meet demand, and market prices have gradually increased. No. 24 can now be estimated at 9 taels and 7.5 qian per dan, No. 26 at 10 taels and 5 qian, and No. 28 at 11 taels and 2.5 qian. No. 24 is the most scarce in the market. Because the supply of thin gauges in the market exceeds demand, and there are fewer purchases from the northern route, standards remain difficult to increase. 3.7 chi is estimated at 9 qian 1 or 2 fen per sheet, and 3.6 chi at around 8 qian. It is said that if business picks up in the coming days, prices may rise further.</p>

<p>The processed coal business in Shanghai has been greatly affected since the Shanghai War. Most of the glass factories in Zhabei have been destroyed and have stopped production. In addition, as the weather is getting warmer, the use of stoves in Western residences has also gradually decreased, and sales are becoming scarce. Recently, the entire city has only sold more than 30 tons per day. As a result, the wholesale price has fallen by 2 yuan per ton. The current wholesale price for lump coal is 34 yuan per ton, screened lump coal is 32 yuan, mixed coal is 28 yuan, and coal ash is 14 yuan.</p>

<p>Result Still No Definite Deadline</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, our Joint Committee has already sent a letter to the Chairman of the Joint Committee, Mr. Ke Yinhang. We have recently received a reply from the Japanese side, stating that the troops in all areas have been completely withdrawn, leaving only a small number of military police. Our committee members believe that the Japanese reply did not pay attention to our letter. Therefore, they sent another letter to Ke Yinhang the night before last, urging him to expedite the withdrawal of Japanese troops in accordance with the agreement. The main points of the letter were: According to the provision in the May 5th agreement to restore the situation before January 28th, Japanese troops are still stationed east of Songhu Road and in the Sha Jinggang area, which is in complete violation of the agreement. Please maintain the spirit of cooperation since January and uphold the agreement, etc. After receiving the letter, Ke Yinhang has already notified the other committee members.</p>
<p>Bilateral Discussion Yesterday at 10:30 AM, our committee member Yu Hongjun and Japanese committee member Okazaki Katsuo discussed the issue of the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops at the Joint Committee office. Okazaki first stated that the stationing of Japanese troops in District D was temporary. In areas such as Sha Jinggang, the troops are stationed for the purpose of patrolling and protecting Japanese residents due to their panic. Chinese authorities can still carry out all administrative powers in the city. Only a small number of military police are stationed at the Wusong Yarn Factory, Tongwen Academy, and Toyota Yarn Factory. Before the war, marines were also stationed there. Furthermore, the Japanese side has ordered these military police not to leave the factory premises. He requested understanding. Yu then refuted this, saying that he had never heard of Japanese marines being stationed at Tongwen Academy before. The municipal government can be responsible for the protection of Japanese residents without the need for Japanese troops to interfere. He reiterated that the stationing of Japanese troops in various places violated the agreement and hoped that they would withdraw immediately in accordance with the agreement, giving a deadline. Okazaki replied that the issue of a deadline needed to be discussed further before a reply could be given. At a little after 11 AM, the meeting adjourned without a result.</p>

<p>Results of Negotiations Between Municipal Government and Public Works Bureau</p>
<p>A Complete Solution Has Been Drafted</p>
<p>Complete Administrative Sovereignty Rests with Our Country</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of all administrative powers related to the construction of roads beyond the border by the Public Concession, Municipal Government representative Yu Hongjun and Public Works Bureau representative Feixindun have been negotiating for several months. By 10:00 AM yesterday, the opinions of both parties began to converge, and the negotiations came to an end. It is expected to be completely decided after both parties seek instructions from their superiors. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun's Speech Yesterday at 10:00 AM, Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun met with Public Works Bureau Secretary-General Feixindun to continue discussions on the issue of road construction beyond the border. They dispersed after about half an hour. According to Yu, the representatives of the Municipal Government and the Public Works Bureau have reached a complete solution to the issue today (i.e., yesterday), and it is expected to be completely decided after both parties seek instructions from their superiors. The content includes police and public works matters, but complete administrative sovereignty rests with us. The detailed articles are temporarily not convenient to be published.</p>
<p>Organization of Special Police The Damei Evening News reported that the Public Concession Public Works Bureau Information Office announced at noon on the 4th that representatives from the Chinese authorities and the Public Works Bureau were negotiating on the issue of road construction beyond the border, hoping to reach an agreement. It has now progressed to the point where concrete proposals can be submitted to the Chinese authorities and the Public Works Bureau for consideration. Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, who is representing the Chinese authorities, has made a similar statement. As for the content of the negotiations, although it has not yet been officially confirmed by the Public Works Bureau, according to the Damei Evening News, the police power and sovereignty of road construction beyond the border are the main issues in this Shanghai negotiation. According to recent proposals, the Chinese government retains sovereignty and complete management rights over road construction beyond the border, but special police may be organized with foreign personnel as supervisors. This supervisor and all employees will be under the command of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and their salaries will also be paid by the Shanghai Municipal Government. However, it must be solemnly stated that what has been agreed upon in Shanghai this time is purely informal and is only the basis for formal negotiations in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Public Works Bureau Information According to a message released by the Public Concession Public Works Bureau Information Office yesterday, representatives from the Public Concession Public Works Bureau and the Chinese authorities are consulting on the basis of an agreement on the issue of roads outside the boundary, and have now reached a considerable degree, with a concrete plan to be submitted to the Public Works Bureau and the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>History of Road Construction Beyond the Border The start of road construction beyond the boundary by the Public Concession dates back to 1862. At that time, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army suddenly disturbed Songhu, and the people fled to the concession. At that time, the concession area was still very small, with the racecourse as the boundary at its westernmost point. As there were many refugees, the Public Concession authorities sought to expand westward, immediately building Jing'an Temple Road, from Nicheng Bridge to Jing'an Temple. In 1866, General Gordon helped the Chinese authorities defeat the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army, and then used the pretext to build Gordon Road, Xinza Road, etc. By 1899, road construction beyond the boundary had expanded to thirteen miles. Subsequently, the northeast, west, and south sections also actively expanded outward. By 1918, the total area reached 29,893 miles. By 1925, it had increased to 48,093 miles. According to estimates at the time, the Public Works Bureau spent a total of 10,039,110 taels on road construction beyond the boundary. The cost of land purchase during road construction beyond the boundary was 2,894,660 taels. This was the value at the time. However, because of this, the Chinese authorities and the Public Works Bureau have repeatedly engaged in negotiations, the number of which is now unknown. If the municipal authorities can thoroughly resolve this matter, it will reduce many disputes between Chinese and foreign authorities at sea in the future.</p>

<p>But the Diplomatic Corps Has Not Taken Much Action</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that yesterday morning (3rd), the US Consul General's Office received a letter from the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, stating that the Chamber agreed to convene a round table conference to resolve all major outstanding issues between China and foreign countries, including the issues of road construction beyond the boundary and the stationing of troops in Shanghai. It is also heard that the consulates general of Britain, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and other countries have also received similar letters from their respective chambers of commerce. However, yesterday, the foreign chambers of commerce remained tight-lipped about the matter. All these actions are following in the footsteps of the Homing Chamber of Commerce, indicating a consensus. As for the consular corps or the diplomatic corps, according to what was heard yesterday, they have not taken much action on this matter and are expected to be seriously considering it.</p>

<p>Since his resignation as Minister of Finance last December, Song Ziwen has been recuperating in the mountains and forests, not asking about state affairs. When the Shanghai War broke out, Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek blamed each other on the grounds of righteousness, and he began to take up his duties. At that time, he had stated that as soon as the national crisis eased slightly, he would retreat to make way for the virtuous. Now that the Shanghai affair has come to an end, Song has been planning finances for months and is extremely hardworking. His spirit and body are even more exhausted. It is heard that he has earnestly telegraphed President Wang, asking him to approve his resignation from all positions so that he can fulfill his original intention.</p>

<p>Will Go to Japan to Take Office in the Short Term</p>
<p>Advocates Restoring Diplomatic Relations with Russia</p>
<p>Minister to Japan Chiang Tso-ping arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing the night before last, hastily packed his luggage, and is about to go to Japan to take office. This newspaper's reporter visited his private residence yesterday. According to Chiang, he asked for leave to return to China in December last year and has recently been ordered to return to his post. After taking care of private matters in Shanghai, he will go to Japan to take office in the short term. The date of departure has not yet been completely determined. As for the convening of a round table conference, our government has repeatedly stated that if the Northeast and Shanghai issues are resolved as a whole, it will naturally agree. Otherwise, if it is only a local issue in Shanghai, it will resolutely refuse. As for the venue for the meeting, I think Nanjing is the most appropriate. The Foreign Affairs Committee has conducted a detailed study on the issue of restoring diplomatic relations with Russia. Foreign Minister Luo's recent declaration explains it very clearly. In the future, Luo will be responsible for handling the matter based on his declaration. Chiang also said that he had held this view since he returned to China from Germany via Russia. Chiang also said that he previously suffered from high blood pressure, reaching 212 in Nanjing. The doctor instructed him to rest quietly. It has recently decreased to 185. He plans to go to Putuo to recuperate, but due to the importance of his diplomatic responsibilities, he has to make the trip despite his illness. The reporter then asked if there was any news of a change due to the recent disability of Japanese Minister Shigemitsu. It is said that the Japanese government will not make any changes for the time being in order to reward Shigemitsu for his disability in the line of duty and will continue to have Yano act as his deputy.</p>

They have now begun to investigate the original burial sites and coffins of all fallen soldiers in order to move them to the cemetery for burial and have notified the families of all fallen soldiers not to transport the remains of the soldiers back to their hometowns so that they can be buried together in the cemetery for eternal commemoration.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Large Artillery Shell Found in Huangpu River <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that on Thursday, while working near the Huishan Wharf, a dredger of the Huangpu Bureau found an unexploded large artillery shell, which was 20 feet long and 8 inches in diameter. During the recent Sino-Japanese military conflict, Chinese armored trains fired artillery at the Japanese consulate near the Mcgregor Road Bridge, and many of the shells fell into the Huangpu River. The Huangpu Bureau is now afraid that the dredger will touch the unexploded shells that are submerged in the river and cause an explosion, which will not only damage the dredger but also hinder nearby navigation. Therefore, it is heard that the bureau has temporarily suspended work in that area.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Post-War Relief Committee Inspects Jiading and Liuhe Yesterday <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Most Refugees in Various War Zones Have Returned</p>
<p>Jiading Suffered 500 Casualties and 10 Million Losses</p>
<p>The Post-War Relief Committee, in accordance with the inspection procedure, conducted its final inspection of the five districts of Jiading, Liuhe, Luodian, Dachang, and Liuhang yesterday. All members gathered at the United Society and departed on time. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>First Inspection of Dachang Yesterday's inspection team remained the same as yesterday. On the receiving committee side, Zha Nanqiang was added to accompany and entertain. They departed in three cars at 9:20 AM and arrived at Dachang Huiji Baohua Temple at 10:00 AM. The temple was not damaged after the war, and all personnel disembarked to conduct a detailed investigation. The cement archway built by Xi Huirun in April of the 19th year of the Republic was blown off in front of the temple. The center of the Zoumatang bank was blown into a hole, which was more than a zhang deep. Further in, the interior of the Weituo Hall and the Daxiong Treasure Hall were not damaged. Only a few flat houses west of the hall were destroyed. About a li west of Baohua Temple is the Dragon King Temple, which was completely destroyed, with nothing left. There were also two refugee trenches dug next to the temple, more than a zhang deep. It is said that during the tense war, Japanese planes frequently bombed, and a group of poor people hid here. Then, they entered Dachang Town and patrolled for a week. There are about 500 shops in the whole town, with the eastern part being the most severely burned. After the First Regiment of the Capital Security Police stationed in the town entered to inquire about everything in detail, the head of the regiment had already gone to the capital. The company commander then led them to visit the team and successively dug out and collected 31 boxes of machine gun bullets, hundreds of hand grenades, 20 aircraft bombs, and electric thunder mines. After reading, they boarded the car and left the town.</p>
<p>Current Situation in Jiading After the inspection of Dachang was completed, they drove directly to Jiading County via Liuhang and Luodian, arriving at 11:30 AM. The county magistrate of the county, Mr. Pan Zhongjia, had heard the news beforehand and, along with the Director of Education Jin Chengyong, the Director of the County Public Security Bureau Shen Jinghua, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Chen Peiqing, and the county police brigade, waited outside the east gate of Jiading County. When the inspection team arrived, they raised their banners to welcome them. The members of the committee then got out of the car, changed to 24 rickshaws, and entered the city. After going to the county education bureau for a short rest and lunch, they took rickshaws again, accompanied by the county magistrate and others, to inspect the northeast and east gates, which were the most severely damaged. The scene in the whole town was appalling. According to Pan, the county has a total area of ​​640,000 mu, covering about 1,200 square miles, and is divided into eight districts. The jurisdiction of each district office is (District 1) Chengxiang, (District 2) Nanxiang, (District 3) Xujiahang, (District 4) Waigang, (District 5) Loutang, (District 6) Huangdu, (District 7) Ji Wangmiao, (District 8) Anting. There are more than 67,000 households in the whole city, and the population is more than 290,000 according to the latest survey. During the tense war, everyone fled, leaving only 170 people in the whole city. The Japanese invaders entered the city on March 3 and withdrew on May 8, occupying it for two months and six days. People's belongings were looted. According to the surveys conducted in the past few days, more than 2,600 households had their houses burned, and 375 people died (not including the unnamed). The Anlu Cotton Weaving Factory in the county was completely destroyed, with losses estimated at more than 1 million yuan (i.e., the Anlu factory on Damalu Road). The commercial losses in the county were estimated at more than 8 million yuan, with the greatest losses outside the north gate. The north gate belongs to Huangqingxiang and was burned for a day and night on March 3, and it is not easy to restore it. According to Shen Jinghua, the director of the Public Security Bureau, since taking over on the 8th of last month, the local area has been peaceful. In the past ten days, they have used silver dollars to buy back many leftover shells, including 140,000 bullets, 24 boxes of hand grenades, 15 artillery shells, two aircraft bombs, and 20 machine gun mounts. When resisting the invaders, only four policemen were killed in Xuhang. Most of the fleeing people have returned, and the shops are also trying to open, but the number is very small. Sanitary matters after the war are extremely important, so they are currently engaged in inspecting the drinking water in public and private wells.</p>
<p>Final Inspection of Various Towns The inspection of Jiading took the longest time, and it was not completed until 2:15 PM. The members of the inspection team then boarded the car and turned to Liuhe, arriving at the Xinzha Bridge in the town at 3:00 PM. They parked the car and walked east, passing through Nanxiang Street to the Taicang Second District Office to rest. According to the statistics of the losses in the war by the office, 70 people died, 24 were injured, and more than 50 households had their houses burned, totaling 200 rooms. After the inspection of Liuhe was over, they arrived at Luodian at 4:30 PM. The town belongs to Baoshan County, bordering Jiading to the west, Taicang to the north, Shanghai to the south, and Wusong to the east, with an area of ​​150 square miles and a population of more than 14,000. It governs 29 villages and one town. After the war, more than 50 households had their houses burned, 20 people died, and clothing, food, livestock, and agricultural products were looted, totaling more than 1.1 million yuan. After the inspection there was completed, due to the urgency of time, they were unable to inspect Liuhang according to the planned schedule and returned to Shanghai at 4:20 PM, arriving at the United Society at 5:45 PM.</p>

They then walked to the North Station, arriving at eleven o'clock. The Receiving Committee had previously sent Secretary Li and Special Commissioners Cha Nanqiang and Lu Shaoji to the station to welcome and entertain them. After a short rest, they were led by Li and others to first inspect the Commercial Press and the Oriental Library, and then to Xibaoxing Road, which had suffered the most severe bombardment. All the members carefully studied the military situation at that time, our side's defense, and the Japanese side's attack. They then went to the Zhabei Branch of the Public Security Bureau to view the various bullets recovered from the battlefield, and had lunch there. At one o'clock in the afternoon, guided by police officers from the branch, they inspected the Bajiao Bridge and Tiantong'an area, which had been the most severely affected. The inspection was completed at five o'clock, and they returned. At six o'clock in the afternoon, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet at the association to entertain all the members. The group stayed at the YMCA dormitory and planned to continue their inspection of the Wusong Forts and other places at six o'clock this morning.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Measures for Clearing Land in the Disaster Area <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Announced by the Municipal Land Bureau</p>
<p>Regarding the sale and transfer of land in the disaster area, the Municipal Land Bureau previously issued a notice to suspend transfers to prevent disputes arising from the displacement of people after the war. At the same time, it carefully planned measures to clear the land in the disaster area. This plan has now been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and was officially announced yesterday. The original text reads as follows: "Notice is hereby given. According to Shanghai Municipal Government Order No. 970, after the recent war in Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Yinhang, Pengpu, Zhenru, and other districts of this city, most of the local buildings were destroyed by artillery fire, and prosperous areas have become scorched earth. Most of the original boundaries have lost their original appearance. Even the various contracts and documents owned by various business owners were hastily abandoned during the incident and were either reduced to ashes or lost. At this time of preparation for reconstruction, it is extremely important to reorganize boundaries and protect property rights. Under these special circumstances, if theft and illegal buying and selling occur again, it will not only be difficult to investigate, but also easily lead to disputes. In addition to the reorganization of roads, which has been ordered to be handled by the Public Works Bureau in conjunction with this bureau, the relevant bureau is hereby ordered to immediately comply with the following: All land contracts, sales, and transfers in the above-mentioned war-affected areas should be temporarily suspended. At the same time, the bureau should actively prepare fundamental clearing measures. All reported households should be surveyed and registered in advance to prevent disputes. Please comply immediately and report the progress of the implementation within a specified time limit, etc." The bureau's petition and proposed clearing measures for the disaster-stricken areas and attachments have been discussed and approved at the temporary municipal meeting on May 24th, and the bureau's original proposed measures have been amended and passed. An official document is hereby issued to be copied and distributed for public knowledge. This order and attachments will be filed separately, and the amended measures are attached to the bureau for compliance. Upon receiving this order, the measures are hereby copied and announced to all business owners in the above-mentioned districts of this city for their full knowledge. This notice.</p>
<p>Attached: Measures for Clearing Land in the War Zone. (1) For all cases within Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Yinhang, Pengpu, and Zhenru districts that have previously been cleared, surveyed, and re-certified, as well as cleared, surveyed, and supplemented with certificates, and cleared, surveyed, and established boundaries, they shall be processed first. (2) Many houses in Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei have been destroyed. The boundaries of households and land shall be surveyed by personnel dispatched by this bureau, stationed in various locations, based on topographic maps and the evidence of neighboring property owners, to clarify the boundaries. (3) If property owners have lost land certificates or field deeds, or other proof of property rights due to unclear land boundaries after the war, they shall, within three months, find reliable shopkeepers to guarantee them and report to this bureau for registration, so that a public notice can be published and supplementary procedures can be expedited. (4) In all disaster-stricken areas, if the boundaries of households and land are still clear and the proof of property rights is completely intact, and a transfer is requested, the bureau shall publish a public notice. If no one raises an objection within two months, it shall be approved. June 4, 21st year of the Republic of China, Director Jin Liren.</p>
<h3 id="e164">The Social Bureau's Plan to Restore the Economy of the Poor in the War Zone <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Expanding the Poor People's Loan Fund</p>
<p>Planning for Farmer Relief</p>
<p>After the devastation of the war in Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, Zhenru and other places in this city, the houses have become ruins and the population is sparse, with desolation everywhere. Mr. Wu Xingya, Director of the Municipal Social Bureau, after taking office, immediately witnessed the devastation of Zhabei. He worked hard to provide relief. In addition to submitting various relief measures to the Municipal Government for review, he also sent Zhang Binghui, Chief of the Fourth Section, to attend the meeting of the Shanghai War Zone Relief Committee, reporting on the two most important measures in the bureau's proposed relief plan: one is to expand the Poor People's Loan Fund, and the other is to assist farmers in resuming their businesses. The Poor People's Loan Fund in this city suffered greatly from the direct impact of the war. Although the Nanshi Loan Fund has been restored to its original state, the borrowers in various war zones are scattered and almost non-existent. It is difficult to restore the old situation. However, for the sake of promoting local prosperity and assisting the poor in making a living, restoration cannot be delayed. The original fund of the Loan Fund was 40,200 yuan. After the January 28th Incident, most of the loans due in various districts could not be recovered. The remaining funds deposited in various banks were only over 15,000 yuan. Although it is not impossible to recover the uncollected funds, it is necessary to allow for a longer period of time in practice. After the resumption of business, there will inevitably be more borrowers. The deposit of over 10,000 yuan may not be enough to meet the distribution of requests within a week, even if only considering Zhabei. It is estimated that there are 3,000 borrowing households, and each household needs 20 yuan according to regulations, which requires 60,000 yuan. For the helpless poor who have difficulty finding shopkeepers to guarantee them, it is proposed to set up a separate emergency interest-free loan with a term of one year. If each household is loaned 5 yuan, and there are 5,000 households, another 25,000 yuan is needed. The situation in Wusong and Jiangwan is the same, and it is estimated that 5,000 yuan will be allocated to each district, which requires 10,000 yuan. As for agricultural loans in Zhenru, Pengpu, and other rural areas, efforts should be made to expand them. At 1,000 yuan per district, another 10,000 yuan is needed. In total, the recovery and expansion of the Loan Fund's business requires a fund of more than 100,000 yuan. Although the municipal treasury is stretched and it is difficult to raise a large sum of money, this relief effort is based on the recovery of principal and is of great benefit to the economy of the common people. It should be prioritized. As for the rural economy, the war damage suffered is difficult to estimate. It is proposed to start with an investigation and then provide relief separately. The measures are: (1) Allocate funds to subsidize farmers to purchase seeds, fertilizers, plows, and farming tools. (2) Reduce or exempt new and old land taxes. All the committee members believe that the above plan is an urgent task and should be listed as a proposal. It was unanimously decided to hand it over to the Relief Group for review and submit it for discussion at the next meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Shanghai Banks Jointly Establish China Credit Reporting Agency <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The First Cry of Chinese Nationals Running Their Own Credit Reporting Agency</p>
<p>Officially Established Tomorrow on Yuanmingyuan Road</p>
<p>The purpose of establishing a credit reporting agency is to investigate industrial and commercial credit, disseminate market information, and serve as a compass for the financial sector, so as to avoid investment difficulties, realize economic cooperation, and promote social prosperity. All European and American countries attach importance to it. Shanghai is an international commercial hub. In the past, regarding credit reporting facts, in addition to the Japanese-run Tokyo Credit Bureau, Imperial Credit Bureau, and Shanghai Credit Bureau, etc., the two American-owned companies mainly focused on compiling directories. Only the banks run by Chinese nationals have investigation departments, and independent organizations are still lacking. After the Shanghai war, the industry and commerce that were ravaged and devastated eagerly looked forward to the assistance of the financial sector, and the establishment of a credit reporting agency came into being. The China Credit Reporting Agency was initiated and organized by banks such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The address is at No. 1 Yuanmingyuan Road, and it is scheduled to be officially established on the morning of the 6th of this month. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Initiating Motivation: In addition to establishing their own investigation departments, major banks such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in this port also have the organization of the China Credit Association. This China Credit Association is only a mechanism for banks to communicate with each other. The qualifications for joining the association are quite strict, and it does not have any external relations. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, industries and businesses in decline were increasingly eager for assistance from the financial sector, and the financial sector itself felt more and more difficult to invest. Therefore, the organization of the China Credit Reporting Agency was initiated to openly specialize in credit reporting facts. Members of the China Credit Association are its basic members.</p>
<p>Participating Banks: The banks that have joined the China Credit Reporting Agency include the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Central Bank, the China Industrial Bank, the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, the Guohua Bank, the Zhongfu Bank, the Xinhua Bank, the Minghua Bank, the China Agricultural &amp; Industrial Bank, and the Central Trust Company. It is reported that the Jin Cheng, Yanyeh, Zhongnan, and Continental banks will soon join.</p>

<p>On June 2nd (Tuesday), Mr. Kang Delu, the driver of the special patrol boat of the Customs (reported as Kenai in yesterday's newspaper), was shot by criminals while boarding a civilian ship to combat smuggling off the coast of Sheshan in Wusongkou, and died in the line of duty. The funeral was held at the Hongqiao International Cemetery on June 4th (Saturday). Many customs personnel and friends of Mr. Kang attended the funeral.

Among them, the representatives of the Inspector General of Customs were Mr. Li Du, Tax Affairs Division of the Confidential Section, Mr. Bailizha, Tax Affairs Division of the Anti-Smuggling Section, and Mr. Hu Fuchen, Tax Affairs Division of the Custodial Section.

<p>The Xin Zha Bridge, which directly connects Datong Road in Zhabei to the concession, was opened to pedestrians at 5:00 a.m. the day after the Japanese troops retreated. Yesterday, it was learned that the concession authorities stipulated that the gate would be opened at 4:30 a.m. and closed at 12:00 p.m. every day, because the situation had not yet reached a completely safe state.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Cholera is Unrelated to Huangpu River Water <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Recently, some newspapers reported that the cholera in this port is related to the garbage piled up along the Huangpu River. According to the head of the Public Health Department of the Public Works Bureau, Shanghai has had a mortality rate of 1.2 out of 10,000 due to cholera in the past ten years, while Calcutta has had a rate of 10 to 20 out of 10,000. The problem of garbage accumulation should be seriously considered, but it cannot be said to be related to this disease. Cholera bacteria do not originate in garbage, and Shanghai has never had this disease in winter. The reason is probably that many small boats bring the disease from areas with cholera and contaminate the water of the Huangpu River. For example, the discovery of cholera in Hankou is usually earlier than in Shanghai, which seems to be evidence. It is difficult to say for sure whether the early discovery this year is due to the early occurrence of the disease elsewhere, but it is likely to be the case. As for the garbage problem, there is no need to mention them together, so there is no need to worry.</p>
<h3 id="e172">The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association Calls for Strict Enforcement of the Opium Ban <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Submitting Opinions to the Central Political Council</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association believes that the Central Government has recently strictly ordered the abolition of the opium special tax in northern Anhui, and the Central Political Conference is also scheduled to discuss measures to strictly enforce the opium ban. On the one hand, there is a sign of starting anew with the people, but on the other hand, Liu Ruiheng, Chairman of the Anti-Smoking Committee, has petitioned the Executive Yuan, strongly arguing that the complete ban is not feasible, advocating a gradual ban policy, and continuing to collect opium taxes to fund the anti-smoking funds. The content is actually a disguised public sale method, which not only violates the Premier's anti-drug instructions, but also contradicts the principle of strict opium prohibition. It is deeply feared that once implemented, it will lead to endless disasters. Yesterday, in accordance with the resolution of the General Assembly, a letter was sent to the Central Political Conference to convey the people's demands. The original letter is recorded below: "Respectfully, the survival of the opium ban concerns the future of the Party and the country, and the fate of the nation. In the past, the Central Government did not have a clear position on the opium ban, which led to widespread rumors and criticisms. Recently, various provinces have competed to publicly sell opium, and there are also rumors that the Central Government is also preparing to implement it. The Association received this bad news with panic and horror, so telegrams were sent to express opposition, sincerely hoping to promote the authorities' awareness with good medicine. However, we hope that these rumors will not become a reality. In recent days, the Central Government has issued several strict orders regarding the strict enforcement of the opium ban. The corrupt officials who handled the special tax on opium seedlings in Anhui Province have been dismissed and arrested. The Executive Yuan has also issued an order to the Anti-Smoking Committee to send commissioners to various provinces to investigate the public sale of opium. The news has spread far and wide, and people are cheering and applauding. Also, reading today's newspaper, the Committee is scheduled to meet on the 4th to review the anti-smoking measures, and all the commissioners advocated a thorough ban, etc. It is hoped that from now on, China's anti-smoking policy will have a day of clarity. However, there is still something to ask of the Committee: The special tax in Hunan and Hubei has not been abolished, and the local authorities and the army stationed in Fujian are forcing the planting of opium, rampant as before. Zhang Xueliang's provinces of Jicharehsui under his jurisdiction are selling publicly. It is heard that someone is strongly promoting the special tax in Jiangsu Province. And the Chairman of the Anti-Smoking Committee, Liu Ruiheng, recently submitted his opinions on opium prohibition to the Executive Yuan, still strongly criticizing the infeasibility of the complete ban, advocating a gradual ban. To sum up the reasons put forward by Liu, it is nothing more than the complete ban offending the powerful and having no profit to be made, and the gradual ban being able to rely on the collection of money from the opium ban as a source of finance, and prolonging the disaster of opium, combining the ban with the collection, and leaving the organizers of the opium ban with room for corruption and money-making. The specific measures are nothing more than a disguised public sale of opium. Therefore, Liu's so-called registration method and the administrative method of collecting money from the opium ban are all steps in the public sale of opium. This is Liu's unrepentant expression of evil, and will eventually be sworn against by the people to the death. We dare to implore the public to give full consideration to the above items, to uphold the Premier's anti-drug instructions, to base themselves on the people's anti-smoking demands, to uphold the spirit of thorough rule of law, to eliminate the great harm to the future of the Party and the country, to vote unanimously, and to hand them over to the Executive Yuan to clearly order the abolition of the special tax offices in Hunan and Hubei, and to order Zhang Xueliang to immediately abolish the public sale of opium, and to order the 19th Route Army, which is about to enter Fujian, to eradicate the opium seedlings in Fujian Province, to strictly enforce the opium ban, and to punish the illegal officials who have indulged the opium disaster in Fujian. To strictly crack down on the brewing of special taxes in Jiangsu, so that it will not be realized. To severely refute Liu Ruiheng's absurd proposal, and to punish him according to law based on the impeachment of the Supervisory Yuan, and to decide to adopt a policy of complete eradication, in order to comply with public opinion and establish a new model. The above points may already be under consideration and processing by the public, but the Association does not hesitate to speak in detail, but only to urge the public's attention. The way to plan for the country is no greater than promoting benefits and eliminating harms. Opium is a great harm to the country, and its disaster has been going on for nearly a hundred years. If it can be eliminated in the public's administration, it will be a great achievement and virtue that will shine through the ages. We dare to express our humble opinions and humbly ask you to adopt and implement them with the utmost sincerity. This letter is addressed to the Central Political Conference Committee."</p>
<h3 id="e173">Continuing the Inspection of the New System of Weights and Measures <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Implemented from June</p>
<p>This city's promotion of the new system of weights and measures has achieved considerable success. However, due to the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, it was interrupted midway. It is now reported that the Weights and Measures Verification Institute will, after the conclusion of accounts for all industries at the end of the 20th year, prohibit the continued use of old instruments in order to comply with the original plan. At the same time, inspections will be started. It is now decided that starting this month, the inspections will be continued in the southern Shanghai district first. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has been requested to inform the Public Security Bureau and forward the information to its affiliated district offices so that police officers can be dispatched to assist at the time.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Ningbo Industrial Bank Opens Yesterday <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>

It is reported that the bank received more than a thousand congratulatory gifts from all walks of life for its opening, and it took several days to hang up the streamers and couplets, so the walls were brilliantly lit up and full of light. On the opening day, the total amount of deposits received was more than three million.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Zhang Xi Suggests Building a Sea Gate on the Sheyang River <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xi, representative of the Fu Ge Salt Land Reclamation Company, submitted a document to the National Government Relief for Flood Victims Committee, stating that the representatives of various salt land reclamation companies in the Lixiahe region of Jiangsu province respectfully request equal treatment in order to fully complete the work on the five rivers and establish water conservancy for generations to come.</p>
<p>The five ports of Lixiahe, which connect to the sea, are essential channels for draining accumulated water from the entire Jiangbei region, and particularly important for diverting floodwaters from the Huai River. However, due to the winding river channels, water cannot be discharged smoothly annually. Whenever the Grand Canal is breached, the five counties of Lixiahe are flooded, causing disaster. In years of drought, freshwater is completely drained, and saltwater encroaches on the inland, making it difficult to find even a drop of freshwater in Dongtai, Yancheng, and Funing. Not only is there no water for irrigation, but drinking water is also cut off, even leading to the breeding of locusts (tiny fish and shrimp are carried ashore by saltwater tides, and when the tide recedes, the fish and shrimp are left to bake in the sun, becoming "jumping locusts"), afflicting both the north and south banks of the Yangtze River. The disasters of past years are well-known to the world, and the scale of the suffering is unparalleled.</p>
<p>After last year's major flood, the government understood the root cause and planned to dredge and straighten the five ports of Lixiahe and build saltwater barriers at Wanggang, Zhugang, and Doulonggang. However, because the Sheyang River basin is too large, there were no resources to build a gate, so it was not dredged or straightened. Consequently, the 15th District Work Relief Bureau was not established. The representatives understand the difficulties of the National Government in allocating relief funds and the unavoidable delay, but the construction of a gate and the dredging and straightening of the Sheyang River are more important than the several ports of Wanggang, Zhugang, and Doulonggang, affecting the interests of the entire Jiangbei region.</p>
<p>It is crucial to remember that while disasters in the Yangtze River basin occur only every few decades, Jiangbei suffers from either floods or droughts almost every year. The National Government spent tens of millions of dollars to repair the main dikes of the Yangtze River, while completing the work in Jiangbei would cost only a few million dollars. Moreover, Jiangsu is a model province, and Jiangbei is the capital's shield. How can we allow it to suffer from disasters year after year, forcing tens of millions of people, impoverished and starving, to become bandits?</p>
<p>Therefore, the representatives dare to present this request to your esteemed committee, hoping that you will consider the above facts, vigorously raise relief funds, and construct a sea gate on the Sheyang River, as well as straighten the river channel, so that water can be discharged smoothly in wet years and freshwater can be retained for disaster relief in dry years. Then, Jiangbei, known as a barren and bandit-ridden area, will be transformed into a fertile and cultured region. This achievement will last for generations.</p>
<p>For many years, we have been deeply concerned and have appealed without success. Now, fortunately, as your esteemed committee is implementing good policies to improve the waterways of Lixiahe, we sincerely petition you to consider and adopt our proposal to complete the work.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it should be noted that each salt land reclamation company has built its own sea dikes and gates and opened its own river channels. Their local land reclamation work is self-funded and does not rely on the use of the five ports or river gates. The above request is made because we have been engaged in land reclamation in Jiangbei for many years and have more experience and clear observations. It is made for the sake of the people and public security, not for the benefit of the companies. This is supported by facts that can be verified.</p>
<p>This petition is submitted to the National Government Relief for Flood Victims Committee by Zhang Xi, representative of the Yancheng and Funing Salt Land Reclamation Companies, June 3rd, Year 21.</p>

Businesses whose licenses have been destroyed and have declared that they have ceased operations will be allowed to cancel their licenses and will be exempt from applying for new licenses.</p>
<p>All relevant stores and firms should promptly report the facts to the bureau for processing.</p>

<p>Liquor Merchants Still Plan to Request a One-Quarter Tax Exemption</p>
<p>Liquor merchants in Hongkou District, such as Fulai &amp; Co., previously sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association requesting them to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council for an exemption from liquor tax during the war. It is now understood that the Shanghai Municipal Council has agreed to exempt liquor tax in the entire Hongkou District north of the Suzhou Creek for one month, following the same precedent as the exemption of patrol tax. Therefore, they have been sending people to various shops to collect the remaining month of liquor tax for the spring season. It is reported that although the liquor merchants have paid the tax, they are still dissatisfied. Therefore, on the 2nd of this month, they sent another letter to the Ratepayers Association and the Soy Sauce and Liquor Trade Association, requesting them to firmly pursue the goal of obtaining a one-quarter tax exemption.</p>

<p>The four trade associations in this city representing the tobacco retail, soy sauce and liquor, liquor, and soy sauce garden industries, having read reports that the tobacco and liquor license tax in Jiangsu Province is being transferred to the provincial government for management, a decision approved by the Ministry of Finance and scheduled to be implemented in the autumn, with the Finance Department taking over at the end of June and appointing Ji Yu as the director and deputy director, resulting in changes to the tax rates and increased burdens, the members of these associations were alarmed and repeatedly questioned the associations. It is reported that the associations issued a notice yesterday, scheduling a joint meeting for 2:00 PM today at No. 487 Ningbo Road to request instructions from the Ministry of Electric Communications.</p>

<p>At 2:00 PM on June 4th, the Shanghai Booksellers Association held its third general meeting, with 36 members in attendance. Lu Fei Bohong presided over the meeting, following the usual formalities. Representatives from the Municipal Party Committee, Zhao Erchang, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Luo Qinghua, delivered speeches. Next, the association's affairs were reported. The chairman described the efforts to resist Japanese goods, the petition to revise the Publication Law, the petition to exempt postage increases, and the mediation of disputes. Finally, it was reported that the book industry factories and warehouses in Zhabei were destroyed by Japanese bombing. Those in Zhabei were of course completely destroyed, but even those not in Zhabei suffered significant losses because the majority of the bookbinding work was done in Zhabei. In total, the book industry's losses accounted for more than 60% of its total assets.</p>
<p>Next, two resolutions were passed: (1) to amend the articles of association and add supervisory committee members; (2) to report the losses in Zhabei to the government, demand compensation from Japan, and request the government to allocate 5 million yuan for immediate relief.</p>

<p>(1) Whether or not to allocate the 200 yuan per month requested by the Propaganda Group for its proposed propaganda plan. (Resolution) Approved in principle.</p>

<p>(The rest omitted) The original text of the letter to the 19th Route Army is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To the esteemed 19th Route Army,</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news of your army's transfer to Fujian, we are extremely surprised. Since the January 28th Incident, when the Japanese invaders attacked Shanghai, your army's soldiers have defended the territory, fought bloody battles for more than a month, and repeatedly frustrated the enemy's ambitions. However, due to insufficient reinforcements and changes in strategy, we retreated to Suzhou and Taicang. The Japanese invaders were afraid to advance further. This time, the government has made humiliating compromises, and the Japanese have agreed to cease fire due to internal strife. However, their ambitions are not dead, and they are cunning by nature. Although the deadline for troop withdrawal has passed, the Japanese army is still entrenched. Without adequate defense, the consequences are unimaginable.</p>
<p>Your army is loyal, brave, and patriotic. The people deeply admire and support you. In addition to sending a telegram to the government to ask them to cancel the transfer, this Federation has specially sent representatives to persuade you to stay. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the Two Roads Bureau and its subordinate offices have been operating from No. 6 and No. 10 Sichuan Road, Guizhou Road, Yuanmingyuan Road, and other locations for four months. Now that the North Railway Station has reopened, the bureau and the station are quite far apart, which is extremely inconvenient. Therefore, starting yesterday morning, the offices gradually moved. The Administration Bureau and the Engineering Department moved to No. 257 Bazilu, to the Railway Hospital at No. 259, the Traffic Department moved to the material department in front of the North Station and the former Shanghai-Songhu Railway North Station ticket office, and the Police Section moved from Guizhou Road to its original location on the west side of Shengshunli. All moves were completed yesterday at noon, and normal operations have resumed. The Accounting Department will remain in Yuanmingyuan Road.</p>

<p>Facilitating Visits to the War Zone</p>
<p>The municipal ferry has launched the Songhu special service to maintain transportation between Shanghai and Wusong. It departs from the Bund bronze statue pier on Nanjing Road at 7:30 AM, 10:30 AM, and 1:30 PM daily, heading directly to Songzhen. It returns from Wusong at 9:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 3:30 PM, without stopping at any ports along the way. The journey takes only one hour. From the town, it is only about a mile's walk to Fort Baotai, which is extremely convenient. Recently, various war zones have been taken over one after another, and people from this city have been flocking to visit and pay their respects. However, transportation to the Wusong area has been inconvenient, and vehicles have not been able to reach it directly, which is regrettable. Even the Shanghai-Songhu train only goes as far as Yunzaobang. Therefore, the municipal ferry special service is the most convenient way to visit the Wusong area.</p>

<p>Authorities Strictly Prohibit Gangsters from Extorting Money</p>
<p>The public wharves in this city have been placed under the management of the Municipal Government's Public Utilities Bureau, which has designated the Wharf and Warehouse Management Office to oversee them. Recently, the renovation of the South Shanghai Wharf by the Public Works Bureau has been completed, and it has been officially opened as a public wharf. Ships are not charged for berthing. However, local gangsters used to take advantage of merchants and boatmen loading and unloading goods at the wharf by extorting money. The bureau, in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau, has notified all merchants and boatmen that if they encounter the above situation, they should immediately report it to the Wharf Police Station in District 1 of the Public Security Bureau or the Wharf and Warehouse Management Office of the Public Utilities Bureau for investigation and punishment.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Products Exhibition Hall, due to the intense patriotic movement, was concerned that domestic goods might be mistakenly seized. It specially obtained approval from higher authorities to issue certificates of national products for identification. However, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce also issued such certificates at that time. To facilitate matters for all manufacturers and to seek uniformity, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has stopped issuing them. Its 93rd Standing Committee meeting resolved to notify all manufacturers with previously issued certificates to apply for replacements from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs National Products Exhibition Hall before June 20th, in accordance with the law. After June 20th, the association will publish an announcement stating that previously issued certificates will no longer be valid. The address of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs National Products Exhibition Hall has now been moved to the fourth floor of the Sugar, Dried Goods, and Sundries Trade Association Building at Xiaodongmen in the South City. Normal operations are being carried out. It is also reported that Zheng Qi, the director of the hall, has resigned and his resignation has been approved. Yu Tianbi, a staff member of the second section of the bureau, has been appointed as acting director.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Rotary Club holds a garden party once a year. Yesterday afternoon, it was held again in the Lanming Garden at No. 600 Hongqiao Road. The garden is the private residence of a member, Mr. Hawkin, an Englishman, and covers dozens of acres. A small river runs through it, spanned by vermilion lacquered wooden bridges. The layout of the pavilions and gardens and the construction of the houses combine Chinese and Western styles. After 3:00 PM, members and their families arrived at the meeting one after another, some playing ball games, others riding small boats. Some Chinese and foreign members cooperated to play mahjong in the garden. After 4:00 PM, a Chinese ancient bell rang, and a tea party was held. More than a hundred members attended. Chinese members included Xu Jianping, Kuang Fuzhuo, Zeng Guangqing, Huang Bingqi, and Zhu Shen'en. The meeting ended at around 6:00 PM.

<h3 id="e190">Ratepayers Association Sends Letter to Shanghai Municipal Council Requesting Punishment of Western Constable for Assaulting Vendor <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association sent a letter to the Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday regarding the assault of a vendor by a Western constable from the Xinzha Police Station.</p>
<p>The letter reads:</p>
<p>Respected Sir,</p>
<p>According to Wang Tingliang's statement to the association, he makes a living as a vendor and conducts his business peacefully. On the morning of May 29th, at 8:30 AM, he was selling undershirts in Tongheli, Maigen Road, in the Public Concession. Suddenly, Western Constable No. 64 from the Xinzha Road Police Station rushed over, threatening to beat him. To avoid his violent aggression, the vendor fled into a house. The constable chased after him, and without asking the reason, relied on his strength to beat him repeatedly. He was then taken to the police station and beaten with a rattan cane, causing serious injuries to his shoulders, arms, waist, and back. Although he was released at the time, he had difficulty moving.</p>
<p>Considering that in this chaotic world, firewood is as expensive as cassia and rice is as precious as pearls, his family of three, including his elderly mother and younger brother, all rely on him for their livelihood. It is not easy for poor people to make a living, and those who do not become beggars are few and far between. Yet, even this small business has been frustrated. The vendor reported this to the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent a Western constable to the Xinzha Road Police Station to inquire. He was then sent to Renji Hospital for treatment and medication, and a report of injury was issued. The Chinese constable sent by the police station brought him back to the police station. The vendor is still suffering from pain from his injuries and cannot work.</p>
<p>Therefore, we again request that your association, based on the principles of law and humanity, forward this letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council for handling. We would be most grateful.</p>
<p>He also showed his injuries. The vendor was originally taking a risk to make a living, and the vendor was doing business in the neighborhood, which did not seem to hinder traffic. The Western constable's interference was beyond the scope of his authority, and his arbitrary beating of the vendor caused injury. The exercise of his powers was excessive. Furthermore, we have heard that fines are not processed for less than one yuan, which is close to being harsh and will only force vendors to become beggars and robbers.</p>
<p>Therefore, we urge your bureau to be lenient and provide relief to the general vendors. We also urge you to provide medical treatment and compensation to the victim and punish the Western constable in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Clever Design of an Opium Den <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Thick Hemp Rope Suspended Outside the Back Window</p>
<p>Ensuring Opium Smokers Can Escape</p>
<p>Jiang Xiansheng, also known as Jia Xiansheng, a native of Hangzhou, is currently 41 years old. He previously rented a three-story building at No. 2 Xiangyuanli, Xiaodongmen Street, in the French Concession. The building was located on the border between the Chinese and French concessions, with the back door facing Dongmen Road in the Chinese area. Jiang divided the house into dozens of rooms of varying sizes and sublet them to others, who opened opium dens. The rent for each room ranged from 20 to 35 yuan per month. He enjoyed a huge profit as a second landlord and had accumulated a considerable fortune.</p>
<p>In February of this year, the French police discovered this and arrested the owner of the opium den, his accomplices, smokers, and Jiang together, and sent them to court for interrogation. In addition to sentencing those who had set up the dens privately, Jiang was acquitted and released due to insufficient evidence. However, Jiang did not repent and continued his business as a second landlord, subletting the house as usual and opening an opium den. He even went a step further and collected insurance fees from the tenants. He also hung a thick hemp rope outside the back windows of the second and third floors so that if the police detectives came to arrest them, the smokers and the den staff could be notified to escape through the windows and down the rope into the Chinese area. His ingenious design was very clever.</p>
<p>However, the plan was discovered by the French police, and on the afternoon of the 2nd, at 9:00 PM, Head Detectives Mao Jingen and Mao Jinsheng, Deputy Detectives Wang Rusong and Jiang Changwen, along with Bao Tangu Mingzhou, Lu Jinxiang, and others, went to the house along with the Western detectives. They first arrested Jiang and then searched the rooms. By this time, the owners and customers of the opium dens in the rooms on the second floor had already heard the news and escaped down the rope. Only two families were found on the third floor.</p>
<p>In room No. 8, they found Ma Agen, a native of Suzhou who had set up the den privately, his assistant Wang Yuanfu, and smokers Lu Genshou, Zhou Shaotang, and Zhu Baosheng. In room No. 12, they found Dai Wu'bao, a native of Changshu who had set up the den privately, his assistant Zhang Youquan, and customers Xue Bingnan and Fan Kunyu. A large number of opium paraphernalia and lamps were confiscated, and 12 bags of opium paste were found on Wang Yuanfu's body. Opium lamps were also found in the rooms of women Li Mao's and Zhang Asheng, but no one was smoking opium inside.</p>
<p>Jiang and the 12 men and women were all taken to the police station. The next day, they were sent to the Second Special Court for investigation. The police charged Mao Li's and Zhang Asheng with illegally possessing opium paraphernalia under Article 13 of the Anti-Opium Law. In the morning, Judge Zhang Chaozu presided over a preliminary hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The defendants admitted to illegally possessing opium paraphernalia. Zhang Asheng was defended by Jin Yu, a lawyer. Li was sentenced to a fine of 300 yuan, and Zhang was fined 80 yuan. If they were unable to pay, they would be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan.</p>
<p>The police charged Jiang and the other ten people with violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Anti-Opium Law. In the afternoon, Judge Wang Gangxu presided over a hearing in the First Criminal Court. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the facts of the case and presented the opium paraphernalia and hemp rope as evidence. Bao Tan Gu Mingzhou then reported on the process of cracking the defendants' case.</p>
<p>When questioned, Jiang denied that he was still subletting the house to others to open opium dens. He claimed that after being arrested and released last time, he returned the lease to the big landlord and only rented one room for himself to live in. He had published a statement in the newspaper at the end of March. He was defended by Jin Yu and lawyer Liu Shiqi.</p>
<p>Ma Agen, Dai Wu'bao, Wang Yuanfu, Zhang Youquan, and others confessed that they had rented the house from Jiang to set up opium dens privately. The smokers, including Chen Shougen, confessed to smoking opium. The court verified the confessions and ordered further verification. The defendants were returned to the police station.</p>

<p>He Yongli Alone in the Room</p>
<p>The Victim Called the Police to Arrest Him</p>
<p>Chen Yushun, the owner of Hengtai Seafood Store on Rue de l'Amiral Bayle (洋行街) in the French Concession, suddenly received a threatening letter on May 31st, demanding 10,000 yuan. The letter stipulated that the money be sent to the Nanyang Hotel at Xiaodongmen (小東門) on Min'guo Road (民國路) on the afternoon of June 3rd, otherwise, they would resort to kidnapping. Chen then sent Xu and his cousin, Jiang Lianfu, to go as agreed. Upon arrival, they met He Yongli, a Ningbo native. According to He, the meeting place had been changed to the Nanyang Hotel on North Zhejiang Road (北浙江路), and the time was still 9:30 AM. After saying this, they parted ways. When Jiang Lianfu went alone to room number three of the Nanyang Hotel on North Zhejiang Road as scheduled, he only saw He sitting idly in the room. After talking briefly, Jiang felt that this petty thief was not worth fearing, so he turned and ran out, calling for the police to enter and arrest He at the Concession police station. After questioning by the police chief, it was learned that He's home was upstairs in the Tongbao Tai Hotel dormitory at No. 624 Xipuyi Lane (西普益里), Qipu Road (七浦路). Detectives Shang Wu were dispatched overnight to search He's home, where they only found his concubine in the room. Afterwards, they went to a certain place to arrest accomplices, but they had already escaped in advance. Yesterday morning, He was escorted to the First Special District Court, where Judge Shen Bingrong interrogated him. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang requested that the suspect be temporarily detained because the case was still under investigation, and that a formal prosecution would be filed after the investigation was completed. Judge Shen then asked Jiang Lianfu about the negotiation process and approved a postponement to wait for the investigation to be completed before further questioning. He Yongli was still taken back to the Concession police station for detention.</p>

<p>The woman, Sun Li, was 26 years old. Her husband, Sun Anbang, was a police officer at the Fourth Division of the Fifth District at No. 7 Mayushan Road (馬玉山路). Since the Shanghai War, the area had been directly affected. As a result, Sun also suffered significant losses. Although the situation is gradually recovering, Sun's financial situation is extremely difficult. On the 2nd of this month, the couple had a quarrel over this. Feeling extremely remorseful, Mrs. Sun had a pessimistic thought. That night, she secretly took opium and committed suicide. When her husband noticed, her face was already pale. He immediately took her to Guangren Hospital (廣仁醫院), but the treatment was ineffective, and she died shortly after. The hospital reported to the Xinzha Police Station (新閘捕房), which ordered detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the forensic examination office on Faelen Road (斐倫路). Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court was requested to send Prosecutor Guo, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Wang Zuyi, to the office to examine the body. Prosecutor Guo took his seat and questioned Sun Anbang, who testified that he was from Shandong, 33 years old, and a police officer. The deceased was his wife. Recently, due to financial difficulties, she and I had a slight quarrel the day before, and she committed suicide. I did not hit her, etc. After receiving the testimony, Guo ruled that the deceased, Sun Li, had indeed died from poisoning herself. The body was handed over to her husband, Sun Anbang, who signed a bond to take it back for burial.</p>

<p>Son Kowtows in Court, Begging for Forgiveness</p>
<p>Old Father Leaves Angrily, Ignoring Him</p>
<p>Chen Fuchang, a Ningbo native, used to run a coal and grain business in Dongjiadu (董家渡), Pudong, and his life was quite good. Chen had two sons, both of whom were married. The eldest son had the style of his father, being diligent and thrifty. However, the second son, A Mao, did not think about learning and willingly entered the lower class, associating with common hooligans. Moreover, he was addicted to opium and often asked his father for money to squander. If he was not satisfied, he dared to be violent to his father. Chen Fuchang, seeing that his rebellious son repeatedly refused to repent and dared to declare that he would sell his wife and children, once reported his son, A Mao, to the Procuratorate of the District Court for violence against a senior relative and opium use. Later, the Criminal Court sentenced him to three months in prison and a fine of twenty yuan, and he was sent to Caohejing Prison for execution. Now that Chen Fuchang's son, A Mao, is about to be released, and he fears that he will relapse and suffer, he has hired lawyer Chao Kun to file a petition with the District Court, requesting to sever family ties in order to avoid future troubles. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhu Chengzan opened the trial and ordered Chen A Mao to be brought to court. Chen Fuchang testified, "I am 75 years old, a Ningbo native. He (referring to A Mao) asks for money to smoke every day, associates with gangsters. In the past four years, he has forcibly asked for money and even hit me. Such a rebellious son is rare in the world. I request to sever the father-son relationship." Chen A Mao testified, "I am 25 years old. I used to work in a coal yard, but now I am unemployed. I married at the age of seventeen and have a son. It is true that I smoke opium. I am now willing to repent." After testifying, he repeatedly kowtowed to his father in court, saying "Father, I know I was wrong. I will correct my mistakes in the future." He spoke and wept. Chen Fuchang turned his head and ignored him. The official said, "There are only unfilial sons in the world, and there are no parents who are not good. If you can really repent, then ask your relatives and friends to plead with your father for forgiveness." At this point in the interrogation, lawyer Chao Kun made a statement. The judge said, "This case is now considered concluded and will be pronounced on the eighth." After the ruling, the court adjourned, and the defendant, Chen A Mao, was sent back to prison for sentencing.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, a young girl was lost in the Ping'an Bridge (平安橋) area of Nanshi.

When questioned by the director of the station, she claimed to be Wang Jinfeng, 15 years old, from Wuxi. She used to live in her hometown. In 1920, a doctor she knew in her village coaxed her in every possible way, saying that he would take her to Shanghai for a trip and give her fashionable clothes and delicious food to wear and eat. I was afraid that my parents would notice and scold me, so I did not allow it. Unexpectedly, he forced me to be brought to Shanghai and sold to a prostitute Wang Maotou, a playboy, near the Great World (大世界) to be a prostitute in a brothel. The doctor took all two hundred yuan of the money for me at that time. After I entered the brothel, every day until evening, the madam would take me to the street and force me to receive guests. If there were no customers until midnight, I would be beaten by the madam, so that my body was covered with scars. I thought that I was still young, and it would be difficult to live like this for a long time. So, after lunch today, I took the opportunity to escape. However, because I had nowhere to stay, I was wandering in the streets. He ordered a written report to be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to arrange for her accommodation.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Aircraft Bombs Bomb Bengbu City <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to a telegram from Bengbu, the No. 102 Douglas aircraft of the First Team stationed in Bengbu flew to Guangshan on the morning of the 3rd to bomb the communist bandits. It returned to Bengbu around 9:00 AM. One 35-pound bomb remaining on the plane came loose and fell on the bustling Taiping Street (太平街), killing 22 citizens and injuring 41. All sectors are furious. The recklessness of the pilot should be punished appropriately for harming the citizens.</p>
<p>Judging from the number of the No. 102 aircraft of the First Team stationed in Bengbu, our country has quite a few aircraft. Why was there not a single aircraft participating in the war against the enemy during the Shanghai War? The airfield was built on a large scale. The people's losses are unknown, taking Songjiang as an example, no less than six or seven hundred acres of land were seized. As a result, there was not a shadow of an aircraft. Who is this "Huarong Road" (華容道) set up for? Is it to "scare Sima Yi with the dead Zhuge Liang" (死諸葛嚇生仲達)? What is even more strange is that the war is over now, and it is time for farming, but the airfield is still unwilling to return the land. What is the intention of the authorities?</p>
<p>Originally, our country lacked aircraft pilots and could not fight against Japan on equal footing. I think this kind of aircraft can either be used to eliminate some communist parties, or it can be improved. Now, the citizens of Bengbu have suffered such a major tragedy for no reason. The aircraft pilot is not only technically immature, but also careless and negligent in his duties. His ability and tricks to suppress the communists can be imagined.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of weapon China has, it will not kill the enemy, but only kill its own people. This can be seen from this incident.</p>

<p>The returning horses have ceased fighting at Mount Hua, when will you return my old mountains and rivers? The remnants of the fortress will soon be spring, the sea is calm and the water is not turbulent. The clouds fly north of Ji and the smoke trees are distant, the flowers fall in Jiangxi and the dream traces are many. The immortal peaches are lonely and the Dragon Flower is cold, leaning thinly on the east wind, what can be done?</p>
<p>With a heroic heart to defend the country, the old man wields his weapon, determined to secure the country and mountains. Able to express loyalty and anger to be recorded in history, still the green waves wrinkle on Wusong. Few people know the horse of the reverse journey, Yu Xin laments the times and feels much.

<h3 id="e218">Aluminum <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Huayuan</p>
<p>Among the light metallic elements, there is an element that is very light in weight, which is called Aluminum. In the periodic table, the atomic number is thirteen, and the atomic weight is twenty-seven point two.</p>
<p>Aluminum is not only a very light element in the earth's crust, but also a very abundant element, accounting for about eight percent (8%) of all elements in the earth's crust.</p>
<p>Aluminum was invented by Charles Martin Hall, a student at Oberlin College (奥伯林大學) in Ohio, USA, on February 23, 1886.</p>
<p>In 1827, fifty-nine years before Hall's invention, a famous German chemist, Professor Friedrich Wohler, had experimented with a few small particles of aluminum smaller than dust. Because it was not easy to obtain and the price was high, it did not attract attention. It was not until Hall used his own invented electroanalysis method to extract aluminum in large quantities relatively easily from the ore seed aluminum oxide (ALO).</p>
<p>Aluminum is the same as gold, it is not easy to oxidize in the air, which is the opposite of iron. Its chemical affinity is far less than iron, because iron is very easy to oxidize to form iron oxide, that is, the so-called rust. However, aluminum and gold are also slightly different, that is, gold is absolutely not easy to oxidize, and aluminum sometimes has the possibility of oxidation. However, even after oxidation, it is as difficult to break it down and reduce it to the original substance before oxidation as it is to oxidize it. This is similar to the temperament of some people in our human race. If you want me to do something that I don't want to do, I will never do it. But even if I do it because of some problem, I can't give it up. It's a very strong attitude. Now we see in the market a kind of thermos bottle lid and a kind of small pot, which are very light and not very bright, and the sound of knocking on it is not sharp. This is made of aluminum. In addition, some parts of electrical appliances, teacups, etc. are also made of aluminum, which is light and sensitive, not clumsy. How progressive is this?</p>

<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>(3) The Misfortune of White Sugar Plums</p>
<p>"Anyone want to buy white copper (sugar) plums? Twenty cents for one:::"</p>
<p>Along the gap in East Xinqiao Street, A Gen had set up a stall selling sugar plums according to the season. He sat on a high stool, wearing a casual hat tilted to one side, a short shirt and trousers of coarse blue cloth, his upper garment open, revealing the undershirt inside, a silk trousers belt hanging between his legs, in his hand holding a fly whisk, very leisurely lightly brushing a pile of white sugar plums.</p>
<p>"A Gen!" A person similarly dressed, but with a foldable melon-skin hat on his head, ran out from XX Lane opposite, shouting directly at A Gen. A Gen seemed startled, and said with a smile,</p>
<p>"Boss (pronounced Du), long time no see." From the belt pocket of his blue cloth shirt, he took out a box of Golden Mouse brand cigarettes, offering one to the so-called "Boss," and placing one at the corner of his own lips.</p>
<p>The boss lit the cigarette, picked a large white sugar plum from the stall, and stuffed it into his mouth to chew.</p>
<p>"Business is good!" Although the voice was vague, the clever A Gen knew that the visitor had malicious intent.</p>
<p>"Boss, what's the matter?" A Gen said, still wearing a smile.</p>
<p>"A Gen! Stop pretending, you closed down Yanziwo, what about our principal?"</p>
<p>"Boss, don't be angry," A Gen took out two silver dollars from the pocket where he kept the Golden Mouse cigarettes, "Business isn't good today, there are still so many plums."</p>
<p>I couldn’t find you for three days, you are selling sugar plums? A Gen! Pay up, cough up another ten silver dollars, or this grandson will make trouble.</p>
<p>"Boss, we are all family, how about you have a cigarette?" A Gen's words were obviously hardening.</p>
<p>"Fuck you!" He raised his right hand and slapped A Gen in the face.</p>
<p>A Gen, unprepared for this move, also stood up and punched the boss squarely in the chest. Thus, two sets of blue cloth shorts and trousers twisted into a ball, as if one happened to pass by this place, one could hear a string of "fuck your mother" sounds.</p>
<p>Finally, A Gen and the boss were pulled apart by colleagues, their hands held behind their backs, still desperately wanting to move forward. A Gen's casual hat was even more askew, the boss's melon-skin hat had already disappeared. "Fuck you, there will be a day when I finish you off," the boss, pulled away by the crowd with much difficulty, turned around and said, "I'll settle this, fuck you."</p>
<p>A pile of white sugar plums, quietly lying in the muddy ditch beside the sidewalk, sacrificed by the war.</p>
<p>Family Issues</p>
<h3 id="e220">Remarriage of Widowers and Widows <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Yi</p>
<p>Mr. Wang, the owner of the tobacco and paper shop next door, who was already old, his old wife, unfortunately, died of illness last year. Mr. Wang was naturally very sad, and shed a few old tears. Afterwards, we heard Mr. Wang say this to people, "I will never remarry, I am an old man about to be made into a coffin."</p>
<p>Yesterday, the front of the tobacco and paper shop was bustling. Two red candles were lit high in the shop. Many of Mr. Wang's relatives and friends also arrived. Driven by curiosity, I went to inquire with his apprentice, Little Shaoxing.</p>
<p>"Don't you know? Today, the master is marrying a wife!" Little Shaoxing replied with a smile. Mr. Wang's eldest daughter-in-law is a young widow, her husband having died of lung disease three years ago. In addition to buying vegetables, cooking, and managing household affairs, recently, since her mother-in-law passed away, she also had to serve her several younger brothers-in-law. In our view, she is not only a very capable woman, but also a very amiable young woman. It's a pity that she unfortunately entered the Wang family's door, and in less than half a year, she became a widow. Her lifelong happiness was thus buried. In addition to toiling like an ox or a horse all day long, she had virtually no fantasies. Speaking of the word "remarriage", not only had she not thought of it, but even if she did think of it, she would consider it to be against women's virtue and be scolded by others. Moreover, within the Wang family, which was within the sphere of influence of this man-eating ethical code, it was even more absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Alas! Men who are over half a century old can remarry, can openly and legitimately remarry, while widows who are in their youth cannot remarry, and society and family strictly prevent them from remarrying. In fact, what is the difference between remarriage of widowers and remarriage of widows? This is a morbid state of Chinese society, and a major issue that those engaged in women's movements and those reforming the family system should pay attention to.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people in society who take one mistress after another, and the ridiculous act of arranging marriage with a spirit tablet for unmarried women whose fiancés have unfortunately died, such extremely opposite facts exist in the world.</p>
<p>Movies</p>
<p>"Underwater Wonders" Premieres. A masterpiece of deep-sea adventure, "Underwater Wonders" (Fifty Fathoms Deep) is a rarity this year. The performance of Fake Ho is truly amazing.

The dangerous state of sudden giant waves makes people speechless. Its underwater photography is uniquely clear.

<p>New Fashion News for Women and Children. Recently, Ms. Wan Sending, Su Ping, Huang Yuefang, and others founded a Kun Fan Clothing Company, temporarily located in front of the French Park, upstairs at the Life Weekly magazine at 80 Hualong Road, to start work. Ms. Wan and others graduated from the New-Style Sewing Training School run by the China Vocational Education Society, and also interned at the Sanyou Industrial Company for a long time, so their skills and styles are all different from the ordinary, and the prices they set are also low. Therefore, even during the preparatory period, those who order custom clothes have been continuously coming to them. New clothes for women and children are especially characteristic. If schools and organizations need to make uniforms, the company offers even lower prices.</p>

The interior construction is extremely new. It is heard that the club will hold a formal opening ceremony starting at 4:00 PM today, specially inviting President Dr. Bu Fangji and guests to speak.

Now, Mr. Lander will return to Europe again soon. Many people in Shanghai regret not having seen his unique skills. The Beijing Theater, in view of this, repeatedly pleaded with Mr. Lander and was granted his consent to perform amazing stunts and novel songs and dances on stage starting today, and at the same time adding the screening of the Russian literary and historical giant masterpiece, the world's most poignant and beautiful film "Resurrection".</p>

<p>Civil Instructions</p>
<p>A Statement of Sovereignty by Vladimir Bababek: This court is executing the case of An Wanglie vs. Bao Wangpaike concerning debt arrears (Initial Character No. 273). An Wanglie applied for and was granted the seizure of the movable property inside No. 78, Notre Dame Road, owned by Bao Wangpaike, to secure the debt.

Now, the applicant claims that the furniture belongs to the applicant and requests that it be exempted from seizure. If this is true, the applicant should file a separate lawsuit to confirm ownership. However, since the creditor has applied to close the case, there is no need for further seizure. Except for the issue of ownership to be resolved in a separate case, the request for exemption from seizure shall be approved.</p>
<p>Lu Xi-hou's Application to Move the Seized Car for Safekeeping: This case has been scheduled for a hearing on June 4th, and the owner of Yad Automobile has been summoned to court for questioning. The request shall be reviewed and decided after questioning (3rd).</p>
