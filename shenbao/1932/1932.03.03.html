<h3>如何創造更偉大之歷史彬</h3>
<p>十九路軍以孤軍抗强敵。苦戰一月又二天。雖終以敵重兵與利器壓迫。不得不改變戰略。退却待援。然而在退却之前。猶奮其英武於八字橋之血戰中。予敵以重創。而後全師從容引退。秩序井然。日軍於此。應亦知中華民族之尙宋容輕侮。公理未必遂終爲强權之鐵蹄所蹂𨈆。</p>
<p>一月又二天。茲已焂然過去。但此一月又二天。我民族歷史篇幅中。爲悲莊。爲偉大。爲光榮。爲永永不可磨滅。極有意義有價値之一頁而此一頁光榮歷史之造成。則完全爲我盡職之將士與人民協力奮鬥之結晶。故吾人今後如欲保存此一頁之光榮歷史。并創造我民族之新生命。則吾人惟有繼續作艱難而持久之奮鬥。毌灰心。毌餒氣。土耳其抗禦希臘。苦戰三年。歐戰前後之上海事件</p>
<p>我軍退抵二道防線</p>
<p>日軍如進攻立起抵抗</p>
<p>吳淞孤軍昨猶在奮鬭</p>
<p>和平談判無具體决定</p>
<p>十九路軍以孤軍抗日、自上月二十八日起、迄昨日止、血戰一個月又二日之久、戰線延長、迨近百里、以疲乏之士、應付陸續而來之日寇、加以器機不良、援軍不至、能支持如許之久者、悉賴我忠勇之將士、以血肉之軀、作干城之寄、自日政府派白川來滬、並率其精銳部隊第十一十四兩團四萬餘、人在江灣廟行方面拼命攻擊、我十九路軍一月以來、晝夜未能闔眼、加以猛烈之砲聲與砲火、已成耳聾目瞶之　、瀏河方面、本置有守兵兩團、自廟行江灣之戰事轉烈、悉數奉調、參加戰事、留守之兵士僅兩連而已、白川到滬後、復將植田之戰略一變、注重側面攻擊、以運輸艦四艘、載兩師團之主力一萬餘人、於前晚駛抵瀏河、用烟罩彈掩護、全部登岸、以二連之衆、抗一萬之師、衆寡懸殊、明知不敵、士兵猶奮臂一呼、爭先效死、迨我總指揮部聞訊、欲調兵往救、奈江灣方面日軍亦同時總攻、後方援軍又不能准時到達、如仍死守、則我軍自眞茹大塲廟行以至吳淞之第一道防線、勢必全被包圍、加以日本、恃其物質之力、以大砲飛機炸彈全力壓迫、我軍佔勝之處、僅憑肉摶、足使敵人心胆俱落、但後方旣彼截斷如不早自爲、地十九路軍犧牲不足惜、但十九路軍覆没以後、我大好河山亦將淪於敵手、故於前晚起、下令全軍、自吳淞江灣大塲廟行閘北以迄眞茹之綜、全師後退、堅守第二道防線、以圖繼續與敵抵抗、茲記撤兵後情形如次、</p>
<h3>蔣光鼐等通電</h3>
<p>▲側面後方均受危險</p>
<p>▲全軍撤退第二防線</p>
<p>▲從事抵禦不與戴天</p>
<p>蔣光鼐蔡廷楷戴戟等通電云、中央黨部國民政府鈞鑒各報館全國民衆鈞鑒、我軍抵抗暴日、苦戰月餘、以敵軍械之犀利、運輸之敏疾、賴我民衆援助、士兵忠勇、肉薄奮鬥、傷亡枕藉、猶能屢挫敵鋒、日人猝增援兵兩師、而我以運輸艱難、後援不繼、自廿一日起、我軍日有重大死傷、以致傾全力於正面戰線、而日人以一師之衆、自瀏河方面登陸、我無兵抽調、側面後方均受危險、不得已於三月一日夜、將全軍撤退至第二防線、從事抵禦、本軍决本彈盡卒盡之旨、不與暴日共戴一天、浴血陳詞、尙祈鑒察、蔣光鼐蔡廷楷戴戟曁全體將士叩冬、</p>
<h3>我軍發表宣言</h3>
<p>▲自動退守二道防綫原因</p>
<p>▲日軍如來進攻必起抵抗</p>
<p>此次我軍全師撤撤退原因、頃由某高級長官發表宣言曰、此次在上海四週作戰之我軍、業已全師撤致第二道防綫、此舉乃基於以前之决定、而此决定之執行、不過一時間問題而已、此種戰略上之撤退、實由於第一綫之作戰、其便利盡屬日方故也、蓋我軍之原有防綫、閘北至吳淞、並非一軍事防綫、其所以採取之者、僅因政治地位之重要耳、請言其故、㈠原來防綫、無攻勢之可能、此則因我軍不願攻擊公共租界、雖公共租界已爲日軍用作軍事根據地、而我軍不願攻擊公共租界、㈡原來防綫與滿佈日艦之黄浦江、成平行綫、故該線常爲日方重砲火力所威脅、㈢在上海四週为之我軍、數字上雖與日軍約略相等、但因運輸之缺乏、實際上僅能用其半數于戰場、此因我國之抗日、旣係舉國一致之行動、而日海軍復完全控制黄浦江及揚子江、故我軍勢必分佈兵力于受日軍威脅之各地、因此我軍之集中於第一道防線者、决不能如日軍所能遣來上海者之衆、㈣所有公共租界之馬路及吳淞上海間之汽車路、均在日艦來復線之内、且爲日方所佔有、日軍利用此項道路、易於使用坦克車鐵甲車及重砲、而我軍則須往來於泥濘途滑之中、以取得後方之接濟、且因日海軍控制場子黄浦兩江、我前線乃易爲其登陸軍隊任意襲擊、至日軍之不惜鉅大犧牲、從事於徒勞無益之正面攻擊、適足見其缺乏戰略上之知識、蓋彼若在黄浦江揚子江沿線任何一處上岸、則我軍爲避免後防之切斷、勢必早已撤退矣、現日軍卒遣一師團在瀏河登陸、於是我軍乃不得不自動退守第二道防綫、我軍茲已到達第二道防綫、日方以前之利益、乃因之盡得其反、蓋日軍此後之動作、旣須遠離軍艦之保護、而其坦克重砲、又無大道可資輸送、且其兵士之一切行動、自必遠距其根據地、因而失其掩護、至於我軍則後防旣得保護、此後每一行動、將較近根據地、因而實援軍、易於到達、且可盡得地理上一切利益、目下全世界所屬目者、厥爲第二步將如之何之一問題、我政府决不與日本簽定任何損害國家主權之協定、此已充分明瞭、毌庸贅述、今後日軍如進而攻擊我之第二道防線、則我必起而抵抗、設因其人數軍備之侵越、致我被迫再退、則我亦必向之再度作戰、總之、現在距戰爭之終點尙遠、戰爭實正在開始進行中、月餘以來、我國軍隊、對抗日軍武力、毫無畏懼、日軍携有坦克車飛機野砲最新式之重砲、凡人類知識所造之器械、無不應有盡有、而我國軍隊、祇有步槍及機關槍、以抵抗日本之激烈砲火、據某外國武官言、戰塲之上、缺乏戰爭之嚴厲、實情有如假戰、蓋所有砲火、俱由日方發出、中國大砲、均被日機炸彈轟燬、中國軍隊、祇有靜居壕内、接受日砲砲彈日機炸彈、必俟砲火已停、日軍出而衝鋒時、始能以步槍機關槍應戰、上海附近戰事、業已證明兩點重要之事實、㈠證明日本海陸軍可畏之作戰能力、不過一種紙老虎、業經揭破、㈡證明日本優於盡量宣傳、每日世界均飽觀日軍個人之英勇、及日軍之英勇、因其有多數之飛機坦克車海軍砲火之協助之種種優勢、在如斯軍隊之中、倘有個人英勇可言、當用之於比較高尙之主義、至我軍之英勇、皆由外人眼見所傳述、毫無偏袒於其間、蓋中國軍隊、並不僅以個人英勇見長、全軍均英勇奮發、無一例外、數萬健兒、誓保國家之榮譽、不惜以血肉之軀、抵抗新式戰器、誰謂如此英勇之民族、能終於失敗耶、</p>
<h3>南京外部宣言</h3>
<p>▲和平倘仍失敗</p>
<p>▲責任當由日負</p>
<p>三月二日南京外交部宣言如下、茲鑒於日本援軍續到二師團、並在瀏河及吳淞復行總攻、特爲重要之事實聲明如左、</p>
<p>查中日代表、因英海軍提督克萊爵士之斡旋、曾在甘特軍艦會商、立即停止敵對之基本條件、當經獲得諒解如下、㈠雙方同時撤退、㈡不得提議永久卸除吳淞或獅子林砲台問題、㈢雙方之撤退、由中日委員會會同中立國視察員監視之、㈣撤退區域、照舊由中國官吏治理、并由中國警察維持治安、㈤中國軍隊退至眞茹、日本軍隊退至公共租界及越界築路地段、俟雙方上述撤退完竣後、中國軍隊退至南翔、日本軍隊退回艦上、（此最後一點、交由將來續開之會議討論之）、又議定、如中日政府贊同此項假定之諒解、則雙方正式外交及軍事代表、當舉行一正式會議、以完成此項辦法、</p>
<p>二月二十九日、中國代表　知克萊提督、中國政府業經贊同、並請其轉達日本當局、倘日本政府亦同樣贊同、則正式代表、可以立即正式會議、但關於東京政府之决定、日方迄今尙無答復、而在此期間、日本海陸空軍、復向中國軍隊全綫總攻、且日本總領事、並經通告中國市長、日軍决意炸燬京滬滬杭兩路、此項和平之努力、在中國方面、至爲懇切、倘使仍歸失敗、則其責任當由日本再度負之、</p>
<h3>上海停戰問題</h3>
<p>▲日方昨日已有答覆</p>
<p>▲郭泰祺訪英美公使</p>
<p>▲我方已向政府請示</p>
<p>上海停戰問題、昨日日方已有答覆、惟其内容、與上星期日日本海軍司令野村與我代表顧維鈞在英艦上所議定五點、頗有出入、故我方尙須向政府請示、外交委員會昨在宋宅舉行會議二次、到財政部長宋子文、外交次長郭泰祺、中央委員孔祥煕、上海市長吳鐵城、及外交委員顧維鈞、等人、討論應付方針、旋由郭次長於昨日下午三時、訪英公使藍溥森、下午五時訪美使詹森、迄無具體决定、至昨晚九時半、郭次長復赴英總領事官舍、與英藍使及英國海軍司令凱萊會議、約一小時而散、十時一刻、英使談笑送郭次長出、互道晚安、郭氏登車去、其時自英領署北望閘北方面火光燭天、蓋閘北大火兩日夜、迄猶未熄、且不時仍有隆隆砲聲、郭次長旣離英領署、即往訪顧維鈞、同赴宋宅會議、宋財長及吳巿長亦在焉、會議至午夜始散、一面將經過情形呈報政府、聞我方主張上海事件與東三省問題、須連帶解决、仍向國際聨盟方面進行</p>
<h3>我軍退兵整齊</h3>
<p>▲主力部隊先退</p>
<p>▲砲隊斷後掩護</p>
<p>大美晚報云、自日軍十一師團八千人昨晨（一日）在瀏河登岸、佔據瀏河、對於上海華軍取包圍形勢後、十九路軍經五星期之血戰、以後防空虚、决定變更陣線、昨日下午開始總退却、陸續後撤、至今日（二日）上午始畢、退往眞茹·泗涇·松江·一帶、北車站附近華軍固守陣地、掩護退兵直至今午始向後撤退、吳淞中國軍隊則堅守不退、必死守至最後一人而後已、目下實際已在日軍第二十二聨隊包圍中、公共租界北區與西區邊境所駐外軍、昨今兩日、嚴爲戒備、以防退兵發生紛擾、但皆目擊中國軍隊撤退時、行列不亂、極爲整齊迄於今午止、未有一兵一卒企圖走入租界者、此次華軍主力部隊、雖自昨日起開始退却、仍留砲隊與迫擊砲隊、向敵陣開砲不止、以防敵人進擊、掩護退兵、日方遂亦猛烈還轟、直至今晨日步兵始向前進、日兵第九師團右翼今晨八時進至李家樓、其中央陣線之先頭部隊、亦進至楊湖、下午十二時三十分與華軍少數殿後兵士激戰後、乃佔據大塲鎭、</p>
<h3>日軍據我陣地</h3>
<p>▲到處起火</p>
<p>▲人民遭殃</p>
<p>我軍於昨晨向京滬滬杭兩路全師引退後、日軍尙不敢遽進、先於正午、遣飛機二架、在閘北龍華等處偵察後、始進北新涇、至下午五時許、閘北方面、始有日兵踪跡、但尙係逐步緩進、昨據區師長及沈師長表示、如日軍再進逼、則决再與之抵抗、警備司令部、現遷往□□、市政府亦將於日内遷往□□辦公、以資便利、</p>
<h3>滬西</h3>
<p>日軍得悉我軍改變陣綫全師引退後、惟恐我軍乘機襲擊、乃於正午先遣飛機兩架、在滬西一帶空中偵察、同時即以梵王渡豐田紗廠内陸軍及其便衣隊、向北新涇一帶偷進、並屢以大砲轟擊、至二時許、已達北新涇口、便衣隊在沿路中、見係我國人民、不以槍殺、即以刀刺、倘見雙扉緊閉者、即舉火焚燒、室中存物、見貴重者一碎了之、因此我國逃難者、均遭其毒手、沿途屍横遍地、火光燭天、慘號之聲、達於四野、未幾日軍、仍繼續前進、刻已達北新涇西面約三里許之江橋鎭、將逼近我軍哨兵綫、故區沈兩師長、於昨日表示、如日軍再進逼不已、則將繼續抵抗、以盡自衛之責、</p>
<h3>閘北</h3>
<p>日軍旣進滬西、於下午五時許、即遣兵進據閘北、以便衣隊爲先導、北車站爲其第一目標、未幾虬江路·天通庵路·靑雲路·亦次第到達、日軍見沿途未燬房屋、亟舉火焚之、因此下午六時左右、遙見閘北區内、火光一片、火頭有十餘處之多、即日軍縱火之結果、所有未及逃避難民、均已葬身火窟、即幸而脫險、亦在中途、被日便衣隊所槍殺、寳山路未遭災各商店、貨物均已一空、至五時半左右、日便衣隊及其陸軍、沿鐵道向麥根路再進、該處人民、正在逃避、日軍以爲我軍兵士、乃以機關槍向四面掃射、同時更用大砲亂轟、因此該處居民、不死於槍彈、即死於砲彈、附近各處房屋、亦被日便衣隊縱火、居民被焚斃者無數、靑陽港鐵路大橋、於昨午被日飛機炸燬、刻日軍在麥根路之西、如再前進、將逼近我軍防綫矣、</p>
<h3>閘北徧地大火</h3>
<p>▲烟燄密佈</p>
<p>▲難民擁擠</p>
<p>昨日上午六時許、記者即徒步由愛文義路·派克路·至閘北·抵新大橋、見往閘北之行人如蟻、旋經守兵開放、遂一擁而過、經恒豐路·共和路·華盛路朝北、由大統路過鐵道、直抵中興路、沿途未見一兵、心竊疑之、旋詢住民云、我軍業於昨完全退出、遙望東首火光冲天、烟燄密佈、向東再進、見永興路育嬰堂路口火勢正熾、延燒約二百餘間、北首嚴家角火亦未熄、約燬一百間、指江廟前高家宅、及宋公園路南面虬江路、中華新路等、徧地大火未已、惟火勢以育嬰堂路口爲最盛、蔓延亦最廣、永興路轉角、新建之閘北電話局、則尙未延及、至此則時已九時餘、不便再進、後經中興路折返、抵舢板廠新橋、見逃向租界之市民約有二三千人、擁擠如潮、雖有通行證、亦不能通過、直守至下午二時許、回至烏鎭路橋擺渡返租界、該處渡船、只准華界人民往租界、不准租界華人往閘北、惟每人須必渡資銅元十枚、河中船隻甚少、</p>
<h3>范其務之談話</h3>
<p>▲撤兵原因</p>
<p>昨日記者因聆我十九路軍、有全線安全退即□□消息、特急至該軍後方辦事處、走訪該處主任范其務、訪問眞確情形、范君方披閱文件、態度極端雍容、與平日無異記者俟其稍暇、即以上項消息、向范君致問、范君聆言、即莞爾而笑曰、昨日我軍之退却誠爲事實、然予可告君以眞相、吾人之退、乃爲作戰上之策略、並非戰敗而退、軍事上秘密、刻雖未能以告君、然不久必有我軍殲滅敵人之事實、爲君證明也、繼而范君又莊容曰、予誠不欲費詞、侈言我軍此次戰爭之如何如何、然予亦甚希望君及國人、應明瞭此次戰爭之嚴重性、吾人苟回溯我軍作戰一月以來之經過、則必恍然今茲退却之爲何種意義矣、蓋自一月廿八夜、日軍向我閘北開釁以來、其海軍司令鹽澤所率之陸戰隊六千人、立即被我軍擊破、旋野村中將帶來之陸軍一混成旅約萬餘人、特别陸戰隊三千餘人、亦不旋踵被我軍擊破、終乃派植田中將統率陸軍第九師團約二萬餘人、前來增援、並運來大批坦克車五十輛·野戰砲兵一旅·飛機一百三十餘架·戰船四十餘艘·於前月二十號、向我軍下總攻擊令、在江灣廟行鎭一帶陣地、作猛烈的攻擊凡五次、我軍與之血戰數日、日夜不息、結果、植田所帶來之第九師團亦潰不成軍、而我方由閘北以至吳淞之陣地、依然鞏固、絶不因日軍之猛烈攻擊、而稍有搖動、最近日方雖更派白川大將、帶領第十一第十四兩師團約三萬餘人、加入前線、向我八字橋廟行鎭等陣線急劇進攻、惟連日仍被我軍擊退、不能前進我陣線一步、此種經過事實、均爲君所悉者、故我軍作戰之能力、勝算之把握、固不待予之費詞也、惟吾人此次在迭勝當中、忽然撤退、此中當有緣故、予請分别爲君言之、（一）我軍自一月二十八日在閘北與敵抗戰以來、第一天在前線者祗數百人、其後我十九路軍共三師、先後調到、繼後第八十八師及八十七兩師及稅警團等參加、自一月二十八日起、一直與敵人激戰至于今、我方軍隊、僅有五師而已、而戰線則由閘北拖長至吳淞、約二十里、且要兼顧南市及瀏河等處、軍隊不敷分配、可想而知、我前線之士兵、有與敵激戰數日夜而不得休息者、而敵方則援軍源源而來、最初鹽澤指揮陸戰隊六千餘人、商人義勇隊三千餘人、第二次野村帶來陸軍萬餘人、特别陸戰隊三千餘人、第三次、植田帶來陸軍第九師團約二萬餘人、第四次白川大將帶來第十一第十四兩個師團約有三萬餘人、每次均附有大砲坦克車飛機戰艦野戰砲等無算、統計目下敵方戰鬥力、陸軍及陸戰隊商人義勇隊、不下八萬、雖迭次被我殲滅者不少、然尙源源而來、且尙有戰艦數十艘飛機百三十餘架、坦克車五十架大砲數百門、與我軍比較、不但器械優劣之差異、即我軍人數、亦不及敵人之半、敵之增援無窮、而我軍人數有限、此在作戰上我軍應暫時撤退、準備第二次之進展計劃、（二）因爲雙方軍隊人數之懸殊、故敵得乘虚、以萬餘人向我瀏河方面襲擊、我軍人數旣比敵少、支配前方、尙虞不敷、對瀏河方面、自不容易兼顧、故此方曾被敵人乘虚攻入、惟瀏河地位、處我軍左後方、我前方軍隊、如不先事撤回、恐有前後受敵之虞、且敵人旣深入、戰線已延長、我如縮短防線、與之作戰、則必操勝利、此無待軍事家亦可推測而知、此亦爲我軍撤退之一理由、范君語至此、後謂記者曰、予雖未以軍事計劃語君、然以上述之點告君、君諒亦可恍然矣、抑予更以下列事實語君、以證明我軍之退、純有計劃的退、（一）我軍退却時、極有秩序、軍實方面、絶無損失、軍心極爲鎭定、精神仍極振作、（二）我軍退後、敵人還以我軍另有計劃、對於我軍防地、截至現在、仍不敢輕進、</p>

<h3>How to Create a Greater History</h3>
<p>The Nineteenth Route Army fought a strong enemy with isolated forces. They fought bitterly for one month and two days. Although they were ultimately forced to change their strategy and retreat to await reinforcements due to the enemy's overwhelming forces and superior weaponry, they still displayed their bravery in the bloody battle of the Eight Character Bridge before retreating, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The entire army then retreated in an orderly manner. From this, the Japanese should also know that the Chinese nation should not be lightly insulted. Public justice may not ultimately be trampled upon by the iron heel of power.</p>
<p>One month and two days have suddenly passed. But this one month and two days are a page in our nation's history that is tragic, solemn, great, glorious, and eternally indelible, with extremely meaningful value. The creation of this glorious page in history is entirely the result of the concerted efforts of our dedicated soldiers and people. Therefore, if we want to preserve this glorious page of history and create a new life for our nation in the future, we must continue to engage in arduous and sustained struggle, without discouragement or despair. Turkey resisted Greece and fought bitterly for three years. The Shanghai incident before and after the European War.</p>
<p>Our troops have retreated to the second line of defense.</p>
<p>If the Japanese army advances, we will immediately resist.</p>
<p>The isolated army in Wusong was still fighting bravely yesterday.</p>
<p>The peace negotiations have no concrete resolution.</p>
<p>The Nineteenth Route Army has been fighting against the Japanese with isolated forces since the 28th of last month, lasting a month and two days until yesterday. The battle line has been extended to nearly a hundred miles. They are dealing with the continuous stream of Japanese invaders with exhausted soldiers, coupled with poor equipment and no reinforcements. They have been able to persist for so long entirely relying on our loyal and brave soldiers, using their flesh and blood bodies to fulfill the duties of a city wall. Since the Japanese government sent Shirakawa to Shanghai and led his elite troops, the 11th and 14th regiments, with over 40,000 men, they have been desperately attacking in the Jiangwan and Miaohang areas. Our Nineteenth Route Army has been unable to close their eyes day and night for a month. Coupled with the fierce sounds of cannons and artillery fire, they have become deaf and blind. In the Liuhe area, two regiments of soldiers were originally stationed. Since the fighting in Miaohang and Jiangwan intensified, all of them were transferred to participate in the war, leaving only two companies of soldiers to guard the area. After Shirakawa arrived in Shanghai, he changed Ueda's strategy and focused on flank attacks, using four transport ships to carry the main force of two divisions, over 10,000 men, who arrived in Liuhe the night before last. Using smoke screens to cover their landing, they all landed. Facing a force of two companies against a division of 10,000, the disparity in numbers was obvious. Knowing they were no match, the soldiers still raised their arms and shouted, vying to die for their country. By the time our headquarters heard the news and wanted to send troops to rescue them, the Japanese army in Jiangwan was also launching a general offensive at the same time, and the reinforcements from the rear could not arrive on time. If they continued to defend to the death, our first line of defense from Zhenru, Dachang, Miaohang, to Wusong would inevitably be completely surrounded. In addition, Japan relied on its material strength and used cannons, planes, and bombs to exert full pressure. The only advantage our army had was hand-to-hand combat, which was enough to make the enemy's hearts tremble. However, since the rear was cut off, if they did not act for themselves, the sacrifice of the Nineteenth Route Army would not be a pity, but if the Nineteenth Route Army was destroyed, our great land would also fall into the hands of the enemy. Therefore, starting the night before last, they ordered the entire army to retreat from Wusong, Jiangwan, Dachang, Miaohang, Zhabei, to Zhenru, to defend the second line of defense and continue to resist the enemy. The following is a record of the situation after the withdrawal of troops:</p>
<h3>Telegraph from Jiang Guangnai and Others</h3>
<p>▲The flanks and rear are in danger</p>
<p>▲The entire army retreats to the second line of defense</p>
<p>▲Engage in resistance and not coexist with the enemy under the same sky</p>
<p>Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Dai Ji, and others telegraphed: To the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, all newspapers, and the people of the nation. Our army has resisted the violent Japanese and fought bitterly for more than a month. Due to the sharpness of the enemy's weapons and the speed of their transportation, relying on the assistance of our people and the loyalty and bravery of our soldiers, engaging in hand-to-hand combat and suffering heavy casualties, we have still been able to repeatedly blunt the enemy's advance. The Japanese suddenly increased their reinforcements by two divisions, while we, due to difficult transportation and lack of reinforcements, have suffered significant casualties every day since the 21st, resulting in exhausting all our strength on the front line. The Japanese landed a division from the Liuhe area. We have no troops to transfer, and the flanks and rear are in danger. We were forced to retreat the entire army to the second line of defense on the night of March 1st to engage in resistance. Our army is determined to exhaust our ammunition and soldiers, and we will not coexist with the violent Japanese under the same sky. We are offering our blood-soaked words and hope for your understanding. Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Dai Ji, and all soldiers kowtow in winter.</p>
<h3>Our Army Issues a Declaration</h3>
<p>▲Reasons for voluntarily retreating to the second line of defense</p>
<p>▲If the Japanese army advances, we will definitely resist</p>
<p>Regarding the reason for the withdrawal of our entire army this time, a certain senior officer issued a declaration: "Our army, which has been fighting around Shanghai, has already withdrawn entirely to the second line of defense. This move is based on a previous decision, and the execution of this decision was only a matter of time. This strategic retreat is due to the fact that the first line of combat was entirely to the advantage of the Japanese side. The original defense line of our army, from Zhabei to Wusong, was not a military defense line. It was adopted only because of the importance of its political position. Let me explain the reasons: 1. The original defense line had no possibility of offense. This is because our army was unwilling to attack the public concessions, even though the public concessions had been used by the Japanese army as military bases. 2. The original defense line was parallel to the Huangpu River, which was full of Japanese warships. Therefore, the line was often threatened by the heavy artillery fire of the Japanese side. 3. Although the number of our troops around Shanghai was roughly equal to that of the Japanese army, due to the lack of transportation, we could only use half of them on the battlefield. This is because our country's resistance to Japan is a unified national action, and the Japanese navy completely controls the Huangpu River and the Yangtze River. Therefore, our army must distribute its forces in various places threatened by the Japanese army. Therefore, the concentration of our army on the first line of defense can never be as large as the number of Japanese troops that can be sent to Shanghai. 4. All the roads in the public concessions and the roads between Wusong and Shanghai are within the range of Japanese warships and are occupied by the Japanese side. The Japanese army can easily use tanks, armored vehicles, and heavy artillery on these roads, while our army has to travel through muddy and slippery roads to obtain supplies from the rear. Moreover, because the Japanese navy controls the Yangtze River and the Huangpu River, our front line is easily attacked by their landing troops at will. As for the Japanese army's willingness to make huge sacrifices to engage in futile frontal attacks, it is enough to show their lack of strategic knowledge. If they had landed anywhere along the Huangpu River or the Yangtze River, our army would have had to retreat long ago to avoid being cut off from the rear. Now the Japanese army has finally sent a division to land in Liuhe, so our army has to voluntarily retreat to the second line of defense. Our army has now arrived at the second line of defense, and the previous advantages of the Japanese side have all been reversed. From now on, the Japanese army's actions must be far away from the protection of warships, and their tanks and heavy artillery have no roads to transport them. Moreover, all the actions of their soldiers must be far away from their base and lose their cover. As for our army, the rear is protected, and every action from now on will be closer to the base, so reinforcements will be easier to arrive, and we can take full advantage of all the geographical advantages. At present, the world is focusing on the question of what the second step will be like. Our government will never sign any agreement with Japan that harms national sovereignty, which is already fully understood and need not be repeated. If the Japanese army advances to attack our second line of defense in the future, we will definitely rise up and resist. If we are forced to retreat again due to their overwhelming numbers and equipment, we will definitely fight them again. In short, we are still far from the end of the war, and the war is really just beginning. For more than a month, our country's troops have not been afraid of the Japanese military. The Japanese army has tanks, planes, field guns, and the latest heavy artillery, all the equipment created by human knowledge. Our country's troops only have rifles and machine guns to resist the fierce artillery fire of the Japanese. According to a certain foreign military officer, the lack of severity of the war on the battlefield is actually like a mock battle, because all the artillery fire is fired by the Japanese side. The Chinese artillery has been destroyed by Japanese planes and bombs. The Chinese army can only stay quietly in the trenches and accept Japanese artillery shells and Japanese planes and bombs. Only when the artillery fire has stopped and the Japanese army comes out to charge can they respond with rifles and machine guns. The fighting near Shanghai has proven two important facts: 1. It proves that the formidable combat capabilities of the Japanese navy and army are just a paper tiger that has been exposed. 2. It proves that Japan is better than propaganda. The world is full of Japanese soldiers' personal bravery and the bravery of the Japanese army every day, because they have many advantages, such as the assistance of a large number of planes, tanks, and naval artillery fire. In such an army, if there is personal bravery to speak of, it should be used for a more noble cause. As for the bravery of our army, it is all reported by foreigners who have seen it with their own eyes, without any bias. The Chinese army is not only known for its personal bravery. The entire army is brave and vigorous, without exception. Tens of thousands of heroes vow to protect the honor of the country and are willing to resist new-style war equipment with their flesh and blood bodies. Who says that such a brave nation can ultimately fail?</p>
<h3>Nanjing Foreign Ministry Declaration</h3>
<p>▲If peace still fails</p>
<p>▲The responsibility should be borne by Japan</p>
<p>The Nanjing Foreign Ministry issued the following declaration on March 2nd: "In view of the fact that Japan has continued to send two divisions of reinforcements and has resumed its general offensive in Liuhe and Wusong, a special statement is made regarding the important facts as follows:</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the Chinese and Japanese representatives, through the mediation of British Navy Admiral Sir Kelly, reached an understanding on the basic conditions for immediately ceasing hostilities on the Gan Ter, a warship, as follows: 1. Both sides withdraw simultaneously. 2. No proposal shall be made to permanently remove the Wusong or Shizilin forts. 3. The withdrawal of both sides shall be monitored by a joint Chinese-Japanese committee with neutral observers. 4. The withdrawn areas shall be governed by Chinese officials and security shall be maintained by the Chinese police as before. 5. The Chinese army shall retreat to Zhenru, and the Japanese army shall retreat to the public concessions and the sections of the road built beyond the boundaries. After both sides have completed the above-mentioned withdrawal, the Chinese army shall retreat to Nanxiang, and the Japanese army shall return to the ships (this last point shall be discussed at a future meeting). It was also agreed that if the Chinese and Japanese governments agree to this hypothetical understanding, the official diplomatic and military representatives of both sides shall hold a formal meeting to complete this plan.</p>
<p>On February 29th, the Chinese representative notified Admiral Kelly that the Chinese government had approved it and requested that he convey it to the Japanese authorities. If the Japanese government also approves it, official representatives can immediately hold a formal meeting. However, regarding the decision of the Tokyo government, the Japanese side has not yet responded, and during this period, the Japanese navy, army, and air force have resumed a general offensive against the Chinese army on all fronts. Moreover, the Japanese Consul General has also notified the Chinese mayor that the Japanese army is determined to destroy the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways. On the Chinese side, this peace effort is extremely sincere. If it still fails, the responsibility should be borne by Japan once again."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Armistice Issue</h3>
<p>▲The Japanese side gave a reply yesterday</p>
<p>▲Guo Taiqi visits the British and American ministers</p>
<p>▲Our side has requested instructions from the government</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai armistice issue, the Japanese side gave a reply yesterday. However, its content differs greatly from the five points agreed upon by Japanese Navy Commander Nomura and our representative Gu Weijun on a British warship last Sunday. Therefore, our side still needs to request instructions from the government. The Foreign Affairs Committee held two meetings at the Song residence yesterday, attended by Finance Minister Song Ziwen, Deputy Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi, Central Committee Member Kong Xiangxi, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, and Foreign Affairs Committee Member Gu Weijun, among others, to discuss the response. Subsequently, Deputy Minister Guo visited British Minister Lampson at 3:00 PM yesterday and American Minister Johnson at 5:00 PM, without any concrete decision. At 9:30 PM last night, Deputy Minister Guo went to the residence of the British Consul General again to meet with British Minister Lampson and British Navy Commander Kelly, which lasted about an hour. At 10:15 PM, the British Minister saw Deputy Minister Guo off with a smile, exchanged good nights, and Mr. Guo got into his car and left. At that time, looking north from the British Consulate, the fire in Zhabei was blazing, because the great fire in Zhabei had not been extinguished for two days and nights, and there were still occasional loud cannon sounds. After Deputy Minister Guo left the British Consulate, he visited Gu Weijun and went to the Song residence together for a meeting. Finance Minister Song and Mayor Wu were also present. The meeting lasted until midnight before it ended. The situation was reported to the government. It is said that our side insists that the Shanghai incident and the Northeast issue must be resolved together and is still proceeding in the direction of the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Withdraw in an Orderly Manner</h3>
<p>▲The main force retreats first</p>
<p>▲The artillery protects the rear</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News said: "Since the Japanese 11th Division of 8,000 men landed in Liuhe yesterday morning (1st) and occupied Liuhe, taking a siege position against the Chinese army in Shanghai, the 19th Route Army, after five weeks of bloody battles, decided to change its line of defense due to the emptiness of the rear. The general retreat began yesterday afternoon and continued to withdraw, ending this morning (2nd), withdrawing to the Zhenru, Sijing, and Songjiang areas. The Chinese army near the North Railway Station firmly defended its position, covering the retreat of the troops until noon today before retreating. The Chinese army in Wusong firmly defended without retreating, vowing to defend to the death until the last man. It is currently practically surrounded by the Japanese 22nd Regiment. The foreign troops stationed on the border between the northern and western districts of the public concessions were on strict alert for the past two days to prevent disturbances from the retreating troops. However, they all witnessed the Chinese troops withdrawing in an orderly manner, without any soldiers trying to enter the concessions until this noon. Although the main force of the Chinese army began to retreat yesterday, it still left the artillery and mortar teams to fire at the enemy positions to prevent the enemy from advancing and to cover the retreat of the troops. The Japanese side also fiercely returned fire. The Japanese infantry began to advance this morning. The right wing of the Japanese 9th Division advanced to Lijialou at 8:00 AM this morning, and the vanguard of its central line also advanced to Yanghu. At 12:30 PM, after a fierce battle with a small number of Chinese rear guard soldiers, it occupied Dachangzhen.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Occupies Our Positions</h3>
<p>▲Fires everywhere</p>
<p>▲The people suffer</p>
<p>After our army retreated entirely to the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways yesterday morning, the Japanese army did not dare to advance rashly. It first sent two planes to scout the Zhabei and Longhua areas at noon before advancing to Beixinjing. At about 5:00 PM, there were traces of Japanese soldiers in the Zhabei area, but they were still advancing slowly step by step. According to District Commander Qu and Division Commander Shen, if the Japanese army continues to press forward, they are determined to resist again. The Garrison Command has now moved to □□, and the Municipal Government will also move to □□ in the coming days to facilitate operations.</p>
<h3>West Shanghai</h3>
<p>After learning that our army had changed its line of defense and retreated entirely, the Japanese army, fearing that our army would take the opportunity to attack, first sent two planes to scout the air over the western part of Shanghai at noon. At the same time, they secretly advanced towards Beixinjing with the army and plainclothes teams inside the Toyota Yarn Factory in Fanwangdu, and repeatedly bombarded it with artillery. At about 2:00 PM, they had reached the mouth of Beixinjing. The plainclothes teams killed our people with guns or stabbed them with knives along the way. If they saw doors tightly closed, they set them on fire. If they saw valuable items in the rooms, they smashed them. Therefore, our refugees all suffered at their hands. Corpses were lying all over the road, and the fire was blazing into the sky, and the screams of misery reached all around. Before long, the Japanese army continued to advance and had reached Jiangqiao Town, about three miles west of Beixinjing, approaching our army's sentry line. Therefore, District and Division Commanders Qu and Shen stated yesterday that if the Japanese army continues to press forward without end, they will continue to resist in order to fulfill their duty of self-defense.</p>
<h3>Zhabei</h3>
<p>After the Japanese army advanced into West Shanghai, it sent troops to occupy Zhabei at about 5:00 PM, with plainclothes teams leading the way. The North Railway Station was their first target. Before long, Qiujiang Road, Tiantong'an Road, and Qingyun Road were also reached one after another. When the Japanese army saw houses that had not been destroyed along the way, they set them on fire urgently. Therefore, at around 6:00 PM, a fire was seen throughout the Zhabei area, with more than a dozen fires, which was the result of the Japanese army setting fires. All the refugees who had not been able to escape had been buried in the fire pits. Even if they were lucky enough to escape, they were shot by the Japanese plainclothes teams along the way. The goods in the shops on Baoshan Road that had not been affected by the disaster had all been looted. At about 5:30 PM, the Japanese plainclothes teams and their army advanced along the railway towards Maigen Road again. The people there were fleeing, and the Japanese army, thinking they were our soldiers, sprayed machine gun fire in all directions and bombarded them with artillery at the same time. Therefore, the residents there died from bullets or artillery shells. The houses in the nearby areas were also set on fire by the Japanese plainclothes teams, and countless residents were burned to death. The Qingyanggang Railway Bridge was destroyed by Japanese planes yesterday noon. Now, if the Japanese army advances further west of Maigen Road, it will be approaching our army's defense line.</p>
<h3>A Great Fire Rages Throughout Zhabei</h3>
<p>▲Smoke and flames are dense</p>
<p>▲Refugees are crowded</p>
<p>At about 6:00 AM yesterday, the reporter walked from Avenue Road, Park Road, to Zhabei and arrived at the New Bridge. He saw pedestrians going to Zhabei like ants. After being opened by the guards, they swarmed over. They went north along Hengfeng Road, Republic Road, and Huasheng Road, crossed the railway from Datong Road, and went straight to Zhongxing Road. They did not see a single soldier along the way, and their hearts were secretly suspicious. They asked the residents, who said that our army had completely withdrawn yesterday. Looking east, the fire was soaring into the sky, and the smoke and flames were dense. Going east again, they saw that the fire at the intersection of Yongxing Road and Yuyingtang Road was burning fiercely, spreading to about 200 houses. The fire at Yanjiajiaojiao in the north had not been extinguished, destroying about 100 houses. The Gaojiazhai in front of Zhijiang Temple and Qiujiang Road south of Song Park Road, Zhonghua New Road, etc., were all engulfed in a great fire. However, the fire was most intense at the intersection of Yuyingtang Road, and the spread was also the widest. The newly built Zhabei Telephone Bureau at the corner of Yongxing Road had not yet been affected. By this time, it was already past 9:00 AM, and it was inconvenient to go any further. Later, they turned back along Zhongxing Road and arrived at the Xinqiao of the Sampan Factory. They saw about two or three thousand citizens fleeing to the concessions, crowding like a tide. Even with passes, they could not pass through. They waited until about 2:00 PM before returning to the Bund of Wuzhen Road Bridge to return to the concessions. The ferries there only allowed people from the Chinese areas to go to the concessions and did not allow Chinese people from the concessions to go to Zhabei. However, each person had to pay a ferry fare of ten copper coins. There were very few boats in the river.</p>
<h3>Fan Qiwu's Talk</h3>
<p>▲Reasons for the withdrawal of troops</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter, hearing that our 19th Route Army had safely retreated from the entire front line, rushed to the rear office of the army to visit Fan Qiwu, the director of the office, to inquire about the true situation. Mr. Fan was reading the documents, and his attitude was extremely dignified, no different from usual. The reporter waited for him to be free for a while and then asked him about the above-mentioned news. Mr. Fan smiled slightly when he heard the words and said, "Our army's retreat yesterday is indeed a fact, but I can tell you the truth. Our retreat is a tactic in combat, not a retreat due to defeat. Although military secrets cannot be told to you at the moment, soon there will be facts that our army has annihilated the enemy to prove it to you." Then, Mr. Fan said solemnly, "I really don't want to waste words and exaggerate how our army's war is like this and that, but I also very much hope that you and the people of the country should understand the seriousness of this war. If we look back at the course of our army's war for a month, we will definitely realize what kind of meaning this retreat has. Since the Japanese army provoked a war against our Zhabei on the night of January 28th, the 6,000 marines led by the Japanese Navy Commander Shiozawa were immediately defeated by our army. Then, Lieutenant General Nomura brought a mixed brigade of about 10,000 soldiers and more than 3,000 special marines, who were also defeated by our army. Finally, Lieutenant General Ueda was sent to command the 9th Division of the Army, about 20,000 soldiers, to come to reinforce, and shipped a large number of 50 tanks, a brigade of field artillery, more than 130 airplanes, and more than 40 warships. On the 20th of the previous month, he issued a general offensive order to our army and launched a fierce attack on the positions in the Jiangwan Miaohangzhen area five times. Our army fought a bloody battle with them for several days, day and night. As a result, the 9th Division brought by Ueda was also defeated, and our positions from Zhabei to Wusong remained solid, and they did not shake at all due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. Recently, the Japanese side has even sent General Shirakawa to lead the 11th and 14th Divisions, about 30,000 soldiers, to join the front line and launch a fierce attack on our Baziqiao Miaohangzhen and other lines, but they have been repelled by our army for days and cannot advance a step on our line. These facts are all known to you, so the ability of our army to fight and the certainty of winning do not need my words to say. However, our army suddenly retreated in the midst of repeated victories, and there must be a reason for this. Please allow me to tell you the reasons separately: 1. Since our army fought against the enemy in Zhabei on January 28th, there were only a few hundred people on the front line on the first day. After that, a total of three divisions of our 19th Route Army were transferred to the front, and later the 88th Division and the 87th Division and the Tax Police Regiment participated. Since January 28th, they have been fighting fiercely with the enemy until today. Our army has only five divisions, and the front line has been extended from Zhabei to Wusong, about 20 miles, and it is necessary to take care of Nanshi and Liuhe, etc. It is conceivable that the army is not enough to distribute. Some of our soldiers on the front line have been fighting fiercely with the enemy for several days and nights without rest, while the enemy has reinforcements coming in continuously. At first, Shiozawa commanded more than 6,000 marines and more than 3,000 merchant volunteers. The second time, Nomura brought more than 10,000 soldiers and more than 3,000 special marines. The third time, Ueda brought the 9th Division of the Army, about 20,000 soldiers. The fourth time, General Shirakawa brought the 11th and 14th Divisions, about 30,000 soldiers. Each time, there were countless artillery, tanks, airplanes, warships, and field artillery. Compared with our army, not only is there a difference in the quality of equipment, but the number of our army is less than half that of the enemy. The enemy's reinforcements are endless, while the number of our army is limited. This is why our army should temporarily retreat in combat and prepare for the second stage of progress. 2. Because of the disparity in the number of troops on both sides, the enemy was able to take advantage of the weakness and attack our Liuhe area with more than 10,000 people. Our army has fewer people than the enemy, and it is not enough to control the front, so it is not easy to take care of the Liuhe area. Therefore, this area was once taken advantage of by the enemy. However, the position of Liuhe is behind and to the left of our army. If our front-line troops do not retreat in advance, they may be attacked from both sides. Moreover, the enemy has penetrated deep, and the battle line has been extended. If we shorten the defense line and fight with them, we will surely win. This can be inferred by military strategists. This is also one of the reasons for our army's retreat." When Mr. Fan said this, he then told the reporter, "Although I have not told you the military plan, I think you can understand it with the above points. Furthermore, I will tell you the following facts to prove that our army's retreat is a purely planned retreat: 1. When our army retreated, it was very orderly. There were no losses in military supplies, and the morale of the army was very calm and the spirit was still very high. 2. After our army retreated, the enemy still thought that our army had another plan, and so far, they still dare not advance lightly to our army's defense area.</p>
<h3>Our Army's Retreating Area</h3>
<p>▲ Only Refugees Seen on Zhongshan Road</p>
<p>▲ The Essence of Zhabei Reduced to Ashes by Fire</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports: Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, our army received orders to retreat. The various units split into two routes and retreated along the railway. The Zhabei troops are now assembled in Nanxiang to establish a new defense line. The South City tax police have all moved to Xinzhuang and Zhuanqiao. By four o'clock yesterday morning, this retreat had been completely concluded within twelve hours. Local security is the responsibility of the police and the security corps. However, the Japanese army, taking advantage of our hasty retreat and proximity to the original Zhabei defense line, still heard sporadic gunfire. Therefore, until noon yesterday, the Japanese army did not dare to venture deep, fearing an ambush. It was not until one o'clock in the afternoon that the Japanese army began to advance towards Miaoxing Baziqiao in succession. On Baoshan Road, teams were also dispatched westward across Datong Road. Residents who were unable to escape were all swept away by the Japanese army, and fires were set everywhere to prevent our soldiers from hiding in the houses. The situation was tragic and terrifying, no less than the "Ten Days of Yangzhou." Therefore, at two o'clock in the afternoon, all the police officers left to maintain security in Zhabei could not maintain order and retreated along Zhongshan Road in trucks. At that time, the reporter happened to be taking a car to Zhabei to see what was happening, but after crossing the Dayang Bridge, it was no longer possible to proceed. Refugees along the way also urged the reporter not to go forward, as it would be very dangerous. Therefore, the reporter abandoned the car and walked forward, reaching the intersection of Zhongxing Road and Jiaotong Road. Looking east, a scene of thick smoke filling the sky and flames shooting in all directions met the eye. There were dozens of fires, an unprecedented disaster in Shanghai. All the pedestrians were people fleeing the disaster, all heading west. The reporter's observations on Zhongshan Road and Zhenru Road are compiled as follows:</p>
<h3>Zhongshan Road</h3>
<p>The reporter passed Fanwangdu and turned onto Zhongshan Road. Four enemy planes happened to be flying back and forth between Zhabei and Zhenru. Before crossing the wooden bridge in front of the Toyota Yarn Factory, gunfire was suddenly heard. It was observed to be coming from the enemy planes. Poor refugees along the way, carrying loads on their shoulders and backs, traveled in an endless stream, all heading west. When asked where they were going, they did not know their destination. After crossing the wooden bridge, even more refugees were seen, some stopping by the roadside to catch their breath, others continuing to move forward without pausing even for a moment. The various horrors are difficult to describe completely. Upon reaching Dayang Bridge, two police trucks carrying guns were also heading west on Zhongshan Road. According to them, the Japanese army had been advancing in succession since the afternoon, shooting anyone they saw without reason. Therefore, their district had no choice but to retreat. When asked where they were going, they hurriedly said, [illegible] . All the defensive obstacles along the way remained untouched, but the defending soldiers were rarely seen.</p>
<h3>Zhenru Road</h3>
<p>Zhenru Motor Road and Zhongshan Road originally formed a right angle. Soldiers used to guard the junction, but they had already been withdrawn yesterday. All the Red Cross ambulances were also parked there, not daring to go any further. Only a few refugees were seen on Jiaotong Road and Zhongxing Road, their numbers dwindling. Most of them were fleeing west across the fields to shorten their journey. The reporter chose a middle-aged refugee who seemed knowledgeable to inquire. According to the refugee, it was dangerous here, and the reporter should leave. The sound of machine guns ahead was being fired by Japanese soldiers, and the fires everywhere were started by Japanese soldiers using artillery shells. The Japanese soldiers are now advancing, shooting at residents and soldiers alike. The sporadic gunfire is the result of residents forced out of their homes by the fire being shot.  Everyone is talking about their homes. The Japanese soldiers reached Miaotou and Yangjia Garden in the north at noon. It is heard that the Japanese flag has been seen at the North Railway Station on Baoshan Road. The fires ahead are all in the Qiujiang Road, Yongxing Road, Xinmin Road, and Datong Road areas, an unprecedented disaster in Shanghai. While talking, several loud noises were heard amidst the gunfire, indicating that the planes were over the prosperous areas of the city, and they were continuing to drop sulfur bombs, fearing that we would not be reduced to ashes, to burn and kill innocent people. It was exactly 4:10 PM. The reporter then invited the refugee to return in the same car.</p>
<h3>Fighting Still Occurs in Wusong</h3>
<p>Japanese planes scouted yesterday morning around seven o'clock. Five Japanese planes flew to Wusong, circling above our artillery positions, scouting our army's positions. They did not drop bombs. When the Shanghai-Ningbo liners Xin Ning Shao and others were entering the port, Japanese planes were flying low to observe. Subsequently, our defending troops fired anti-aircraft guns, and the Japanese planes immediately fled.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Shell</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, the Taikoo Company's Yangtze River steamer Wuchang, coming from Hankou to Shanghai, entered the Wusongkou and saw two Japanese warships shelling our artillery positions. Our defending artillery troops also fired back. The battle intensified, and the Wuchang immediately sailed into the Huangpu River at full speed. The fighting had not yet stopped.</p>
<h3>The Battle History of the 19th Route Army</h3>
<p>▲ The Forty-Eighth Battle</p>
<p>▲ The Whole World is Shocked</p>
<p>The "Great American Evening Post" says: The 19th Route Army, which retreated from Zhabei across the Wusong River today, can be called a marvel of war achievements in Chinese military history. In eight years, the army has fought 48 major battles, winning 27 of them. The army was originally the 2nd Brigade of the Guangdong Army, later reorganized into the 10th Division, then the 61st Division, and then the 11th Route Army, eventually becoming the present 19th Route Army. To record the history of the 19th Route Army, one must go back eight years, when a group of Guangdong youths was incorporated into the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Division of the Guangdong Army, led by two brave and healthy officers in their thirties, one being Cai Tingkai and the other being Jiang Guangnai. Today, one is the Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army, and the other is the Commander of the 19th Route Army, already new heroes of China. At that time, the Guangdong situation was chaotic. Chen Jiongming and Lin Hu advanced from Shantou to spy on Guangdong, intending to drive out Sun Yat-sen. The provincial authorities dispatched troops to resist, but suffered repeated defeats. Soon, the enemy troops were only a few days away from the provincial capital. The provincial authorities then ordered the 1st Division of the Guangdong Army to rush to meet them. The 2nd Brigade was part of that division. They won a battle, which was Cai and Jiang's baptism of fire. After the battle, Chen Mingshu was appointed commander of the 10th Division, with Jiang Guangnai as his deputy, and Cai Tingkai as commander of the 2nd Brigade. That year, they were credited with quelling the rebellion. In 1926, all the Guangdong troops were under the command of Chiang Kai-shek, vowing to launch the Northern Expedition. The 10th Division was the first to enter Hunan Province, capturing Changsha. In the Battle of Tingsi Bridge, they fought to the death with Wu Peifu's elite troops. Although they won a great victory, many officers and soldiers died. Then they went down the river, occupied Hankou, and reorganized there into the 11th Route Army, with Chen Mingshu as the army commander and Jiang Guangnai as his deputy. Cai Tingkai was promoted to commander of the 10th Division. When Wu Peifu ordered a general retreat, the entire division entered Henan. Only Liu Yuchun led elite troops to defend Wuchang stubbornly. The National Army repeatedly attacked without success. Then the 11th Route Army was transferred, ordered to capture it within a week. On the night of receiving the order, Chen, Jiang, and Cai formulated a strategy and marched that very night. The next morning, the five-color flag on the city had been changed to the flag with the blue sky and white sun. In the autumn of 1927, the 11th Route Army was ordered to enter Jiangxi to fight against Sun Chuanfang's army. The division arrived and captured Nanchang in a few days. The last warlord of the Beiyang faction was completely defeated from then on. Later, because red elements took control of the Jiangxi provincial government, Chen and Jiang went to Nanjing. At that time, the National Government had been established. Cai then returned to Guangdong. That year, Chen and Jiang were ordered to return to Guangdong to suppress the communists. Later, Chen served as chairman of the Guangdong Provisional Provincial Government until April of last year, when he was forced to step down due to the split between Ningbo and Guangdong. Jiang then served as army commander of the 11th Route Army. The army was later reorganized into the 3rd Division, directly under the Nanjing government, with Cai as the deputy division commander. Disagreements between Guangdong and Guangxi led to civil war. Jiang was reassigned as commander of the 61st Division, and Cai was promoted to commander of the 60th Division, guarding the Guangdong border to defend against the Guangxi army, but did not attack. A year later, the two divisions were ordered to go north to participate in the campaign against the so-called Northern Mixed Government. At that time, they were reorganized into the 19th Route Army, with Jiang as the army commander and Cai as his deputy. They defeated Feng Yuxiang's elite troops. Not long after, another civil war broke out. The 19th Route Army was ordered back to Jiangxi to rest. In the autumn of 1931, they resumed their task of suppressing the communists. On September 7th and 8th, they besieged Xingguo City, the base of the communist leader He Long, and defeated him greatly, killing many enemies. While Chen Mingshu was being driven out of Guangdong, the 19th Route Army was still in Jiangxi. Later, Chen served as the Commander of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison, so the 19th Route Army was transferred to defend the Beijing-Shanghai area. On January 28th of this year, the Japanese army invaded Zhabei, leading to resistance. This was the 48th battle experienced by the army, which shocked the whole world.</p>
<h3>The Situation in the South City is Still Stable</h3>
<p>▲ Police Maintain Order</p>
<p>Since our army's retreat yesterday, people were panicked for a time. People in the South City area moved out one after another. However, the entire staff of the Public Security Bureau and the police brigade</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>continue to serve as usual. Patrol police and security corps are searching pedestrians as before. According to news from the Public Security Bureau, the military police and police force stationed in the South City are sufficient to protect the area, and security can be said to be worry-free.</p>
<h3>Kunshan Station is Safe</h3>
<p>▲ The Enemy at Fubridge Has Not Yet Retreated Suzhou dispatch on the 2nd: This morning, enemy planes bombed Kunshan Station without success. The enemy at Fubridge has not retreated, and shelling continued at dusk.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Battalion Commander Was Killed by Our Troops</h3>
<p>▲ A China Expert in the Enemy Army In the battle near Jiangwan after 8 a.m. the day before yesterday, the Japanese side used the Sakakibara regiment of the previous division as the left wing, the Hayashi regiment as the middle route, and the Tokuno regiment as the right wing. From the west of Jiangwan and the west end of Yanjiachai in the south, they attacked our garrison across the river. The intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented. At 10 p.m., the Japanese army suddenly sounded the bugle and simultaneously advanced across the river in a full-scale assault, rushing into our army's positions. Our army lay in ambush in the trenches, waiting for them to approach the battlements, at a distance of no more than three or four meters, before launching a counterattack. After an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy troops suffered more than half casualties, and the enemy Colonel Hayashi, the commander of the regiment, was seriously wounded, a bullet piercing his abdomen. The enemy army collapsed and could not fight. They desperately carried Hayashi across the river and fled back. It is heard that Hayashi died of his wounds at the rear field hospital at one o'clock. Before his death, he served as an advisor to Zhang Zuoxiang for a total of seven years. He returned to Japan on August 11th last year and was considered one of the few China experts in the enemy army.</p>
<h3>Citibank and HSBC Jointly Protest</h3>
<p>The "Great American Evening Post" says that after the Japanese Consul-General Murai wrote to Mayor Wu, threatening to bomb the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, Citibank and HSBC have separately protested to the Japanese authorities and the British Foreign Office in London. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway has absorbed £2.9 million in British capital, and the outstanding debt is still £2,784,000. This debt is secured by the railway and all its property and equipment. Citibank and HSBC have recommended engineers and chief accountants to the Chinese government's Ministry of Railways, who also act as custodians of the collateral. The company is now protesting to both the British and Japanese authorities, but it is said that they have not yet received a reply.</p>
<h3>Execution of the Traitor Tang Yongshan</h3>
<p>The traitor Tang Yongshan, who acted as a spy for the Japanese, was previously arrested by the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. After being sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation and found to be true, he was executed by firing squad at the Chen Yingshi Memorial Tower in Zhabei yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. His proclamation is recorded below for public notice: Regarding the matter proclaimed, according to the report of Wu Shaolin, the head of the Fourth District, the Sixth Squad of the Police found an enemy spy named Tang Yongshan near the Jiaotong Road Railway, along with evidence, and handed him over to the bureau for transfer. According to Tang Yongshan's confession, he worked in a Japanese-run Shanghai yarn factory. During the recent war, foreman Zhu Fengshan was hired to recruit workers to spy on our army's strengths and weaknesses. I was assigned to spy in Zhabei Zhenru Nanxiang and other places in the Chinese territory. I had already scouted Nanxiang once, and this time I came to Zhabei to spy and was caught. The copper coin with a hole from the fifth year of the Republic of China that I was carrying was a payroll voucher, and my monthly salary was 20 yuan, which I did not deny. It is found that Tang Yongshan acted as a spy for the enemy, which is extremely illegal. Therefore, in accordance with the instruction of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters on February 10th, this bureau is authorized to take convenient action against military criminals, and in accordance with Article 2, Clause 2, and Article 18, Clause 2 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law, he is sentenced to death. At 2 p.m. on the second day of this month, the said Tang Yongshan was questioned to verify his identity, tied up, and taken to the execution ground to be executed by firing squad. In addition to reporting to the Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, this proclamation is hereby issued to the people of the whole territory for their information. This proclamation.</p>
<h3>The General Chamber of Commerce Sends a Telegram to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>▲ Please Maintain the Convention and Preserve Far Eastern Business The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the League of Nations yesterday: Geneva, Secretariat of the League of Nations, greetings. The General Federation of Commerce of Shanghai and the United Association of Commerce of Nanjing Road, in the Republic of China, held a general committee meeting at 3 p.m. on February 29th. It was unanimously agreed that the declaration of the Nanjing Road Business Association on February 11th resolved three measures (namely 1. The Japanese army completely withdraws from Shanghai Municipality; 2. The Municipal Council is entitled to fully exercise police powers within the settlement, and investigate missing residents as taxpayers with the obligation to ensure their safety; 3. The Municipal Council is responsible for restraining the Japanese residents from using excuses to provoke and continue their inhumane and barbaric acts to harm our taxpayer citizens.) The authorities of the Shanghai International Settlement have not fully implemented these measures. The lives and property of the Chinese people cannot be guaranteed. It is unanimously advocated that the League of Nations swiftly implement effective measures to maintain the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty to safeguard world peace, so that Far Eastern business can be restored, seek interests, and await a reply by telegram. The General Federation of Commerce of Shanghai and the United Association of Commerce of Nanjing Road kowtow in the East Indies.</p>

<h3>Bishop Huizhu Visits the Wounded Soldiers' Hospital</h3>
<p>Archbishop Huizhu of the Catholic Church is very concerned about our wounded soldiers and has been visiting various hospitals for several days to express his condolences. Yesterday, Bishop Huizhu, accompanied by Father Shan, the director of the hospital, and others, visited the Thirtieth Wounded Soldiers' Hospital of the Catholic Church in Dongjiadu, South City, to express his condolences. The hospital director, Father Zhang Bingbiao, and the deputy director, Mr. Lu Yingeeng, guided him to visit the first and second wards. He extended his condolences to the wounded soldiers and expressed his affection. After the visit, Mr. Lu Bohong led him to visit the Sixteenth Wounded Soldiers' Hospital in Xin Puyu Hall, expressing his satisfaction and blessing the wounded soldiers, praying to God to grant them a speedy recovery. As the two hospitals now have more than 200 wounded soldiers each, the expenses are huge, and there is a shortage of cash, as well as medical supplies, cotton-padded jackets, and socks. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will provide assistance to benefit the wounded soldiers.</p>
<h3>The French Consul Donates Money to Comfort Our Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>French Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Kang Geelin, in order to comfort our wounded soldiers, personally handed over a large sum of 5,000 yuan to Madame Kong at the Kong residence on West Ames Road yesterday for the use of the temporary rear hospital she is running, which is an important expression of goodwill between China and France.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Protects Security</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the anti-Japanese troops in Zhabei retreated completely for strategic reasons. As a result, ignorant people started rumors, and the residents of the South City were panicked upon hearing this. They helped the old and carried the young, carrying suitcases and appliances, or carrying bags of clothes, and fled to the settlements in the North City. As a result, the number of pedestrians on the roads in the French Concession from noon onwards suddenly increased several times compared to the previous few days. The French authorities, fearing that it would affect the security of the concession, specially dispatched defense troops and reserve soldiers, as well as the reserve team of the patrol house, to protect the key points along the border between China and France, and dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to patrol the roads to maintain the peace and order of the concession.</p>

<p>Luoyang, when the Second Plenary Session opened today, Wang Jingwei gave a speech, saying that this meeting will discuss and decide 1. The future permanent capital of China; 2. Japan has now gathered six divisions in Shanghai, and the entire meeting should consider how to concentrate the strength of the whole country to resolutely resist Japan's aggression; 3. National foreign policy has sufficient reasons, but no military force to back it up. If the League of Nations cannot assist China, what policy should China adopt? 4. Since the Japanese army attacked Shanghai, the government's finances have been greatly strained. Fortunately, those who purchased government bonds have agreed to reduce interest rates and extend the repayment period. However, a concrete financial plan for the aftermath must now be formulated (Reuters dispatch on the 1st).</p>

<h3>The Foreign Affairs Committee Discusses the Armistice Incident</h3>

<h3>The Chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council Receives Chinese and Japanese Representatives</h3>
<p>Demanding that the Japanese Side Immediately Cease Fire</p>
<p>Our Country Accepts Pengu's Proposal</p>
<p>Geneva, the chairman of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations, Pengu, successively received the Chinese representative Yan Huiqing and the Japanese representative Sato this morning. Mr. Yan protested against Japan's actions, saying that in the current situation, since the two countries have recognized the holding of a meeting and invited other related countries to participate in order to resolve the dispute, Japan still has such actions, which is regrettable. Pengu said to Sato that the letter from yesterday will be answered soon and is pleased that the Japanese government is willing to accept the plan proposed by the Administrative Council on February 29. Pengu also firmly stated that this plan, namely "convening a meeting," naturally takes on-site consultation as a means, with the condition of ceasing hostilities. Finally, Mr. Pengu asked Sato to explain what action the Japanese government is prepared to take on this level. Pengu again earnestly requested the Japanese representative to immediately stop the military action in Shanghai so that when the special general meeting of the League of Nations convenes tomorrow, Shanghai would not still be at war. As for the terms of the armistice, Mr. Pengu said that they should be discussed at length on the spot, with the emphasis only on "stopping shooting" as soon as possible, and also said that everything he said was rational and that he thought the Japanese government would eventually listen (Havas dispatch on the 20th).</p>
<p>Geneva, the news from Shanghai has caused a bad impression among the people in the League of Nations, because everyone thought that since Japan has accepted the suggestions of the Administrative Council, it should immediately stop hostilities, but the events in Shanghai yesterday proved that this is not the case. Japan wants to use its newly arrived reinforcements to seek a military victory, which is disappointing (Havas dispatch on the 2nd).</p>
<p>Geneva, a spokesman for the delegation attending the League of Nations stated today that China has notified the representatives of various countries in Shanghai that it is willing to accept Pengu's proposal. The Chinese delegation has received instructions, but will only contact the Secretariat of the League of Nations after the ceasefire (Reuters dispatch on the 1st).</p>
<p>Paris, the Paris theory is optimistic and solemn about the trend of peace in the Far East, and they all feel that Japan now has an excellent opportunity to prove its sincerity in declaring that it has no land in Shanghai (Reuters dispatch on the 1st).</p>
<h3>League of Nations Special Meeting Schedule</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Council's special meeting in Geneva to consider the Sino-Japanese dispute is scheduled to open at 10:30 AM tomorrow. The proceedings of the meeting will largely depend on developments within the next few hours. However, the morning session will be solely for the election of the president and vice-president, while the afternoon session will be devoted to presenting the details of the Shanghai Incident. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Privy Council Discusses Shanghai Military Expenditure Proposal</h3>
<p>Additional ¥16 Million Approved</p>
<p>The Tokyo Cabinet had applied on February 26th for an additional appropriation of ¥22 million for Shanghai expenses. Today, after lengthy debate by the Privy Council's Investigating Committee, an appropriation of ¥16 million was approved. It is expected that the Privy Council's plenary meeting tomorrow will approve this recommendation. At the same time, it will also be proposed that if further military expenditure is required, the Diet should be convened to discuss it. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>U.S. Fleet Maneuvers a Pre-Planned Event</h3>
<p>Not a Demonstration</p>
<p>Further Statements from the U.S. Navy Department</p>
<p>A U.S. official in Nanjing told interviewers that the U.S. fleet's Pacific maneuvers were a pre-planned event and not a demonstration due to the unresolved Sino-Japanese issue. The U.S. position on the League of Nations is that, as a non-member, it has no recommendations to make within the League. However, following invitations to cooperate from the League of Nations and the British government, it is attending as an observer. The U.S. is very concerned about the situation in Shanghai because of substantial U.S. business interests there. As for the U.S. government's commitment to the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, it will certainly do its utmost to uphold them and prevent them from becoming ineffective. Secretary of State Stimson's statements reflect this purpose. Regarding the Shanghai ceasefire issue, the U.S. position is the same as that advocated by Paul Linebarger, and it sincerely hopes that such mediation will have a positive outcome, because further fighting will only result in sacrifices for both China and Japan, with no gains. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington, today: The U.S. Navy Department issued a further statement regarding the deployment of more than two-thirds of the nation's fleet to the Pacific for maneuvers. The Atlantic Patrol Force will join the battle fleet in San Diego on March 23rd for maneuvers, and then, until April 3rd, will engage in tactical exercises according to the plan announced last December, concluding on May 13th. At that time, the Patrol Force will return to the Atlantic. A total of 141 vessels will participate in these maneuvers. The statement solemnly declared that all of this was a plan predetermined months ago. It also indicated that the army and naval forces in Shanghai are more than sufficient to cope with any developments that may be envisioned in the current situation. (Kuo Min News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Northeastern Volunteer Army Occupies Jinxi</h3>
<p>Also Very Successful in the Chaoyang Campaign</p>
<p>In recent days, the Volunteer Army has engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army in Jinxi and Chaoyang. Jinxi has already been occupied by the Volunteer Army, and the situation in Chaoyang is also very favorable. In the Daheishan and Daling River area, the militia has been engaged in intense battles with the Japanese army for the past five or six days, resulting in the deaths of one Japanese major general brigade commander and one lieutenant general brigade commander, as well as four to five hundred soldiers. The Japanese side is dispatching reinforcements and requisitioning replacements from Japanese residents in Shenyang. Young men in that area are fleeing to Dalian to avoid conscription. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>According to news from Harbin today, the former Jilin government's troops are now retreating eastward without fighting. A few days ago, this army occupied the entire eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, from Mashan west of Yimianpo to Suifenhe. However, today's news indicates that Maershan and Yimianpo have been captured by the Jilin New Government's troops, and the Japanese army, dispatched from Jilin, has occupied Dongping. Japanese sources say that Ding Chao has been ordered to announce his obedience to the Jilin New Government today, or else he will be coerced by force. Today, leaflets were found in Fengjiadian, stating that Ding Chao has recognized the New Government and that his troops will be incorporated into the New Army. It is reported that Ma Zhanshan's troops are now considering rebellion and do not wish to recognize Ma Zhanshan as their leader. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Japanese military headquarters here claims that Ding Chao and Xi Qia have already reached a compromise, so the Japanese army will not advance along the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Puppet State Postponed</h3>
<p>Supporters of this Move Have Reservations</p>
<p>Beijing: The establishment of the puppet state in the Northeast has been postponed for ten days. However, the nature and structure of the state have already been telegraphed to various counties. The state's name is the Manchurian-Mongolian Republic, the reign year is Datong Year 1, and the national flag is a yellow rectangle with red, blue, black, and white in the upper left corner. On the evening of the 29th, various places uniformly held so-called celebratory gatherings and distributed various propaganda materials. The puppet state is now expanding its military preparations, and the Japanese army is also incorporating White Flag bandits. The Shenyang Arsenal has started production, with all authority completely in the hands of the Japanese. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Shenyang: Yesterday, this office sent personnel to Lushun to urge Pu Yi to assume the presidency of the new Manchurian state. Japanese newspapers reported that Pu Yi would arrive in Changchun on the 5th to hold the inauguration ceremony. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Reports from Changchun state that Pu Yi is scheduled to assume the position of head of the new state of Manchuria on March 10th. At the same time, the Japanese military headquarters in Shenyang will be moved to Changchun. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Shenyang: Chinese-language newspapers report that Pu Yi has postponed his inauguration until April 1st. This claim has been confirmed by other sources. The reason for the postponement is said to be that a suitable residence needs to be prepared for Pu Yi in Changchun. However, according to foreigners, the true reason is that the Chinese and Japanese supporters of this move have reservations, as this action may be ridiculed both domestically and internationally and will increase China's hostility. Shenyang has sent representatives to Lushun twice to persuade Pu Yi to assume the position. It is reported that he initially declined but later agreed. This is truly what the Chinese call "hypocritical." The consulates of various countries in Shenyang have not yet received formal notifications of independence. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>American Newspapers Unanimously Praise General Cai</h3>
<p>New York: After news arrived in the United States that Shanghai was in contact to reopen peace talks, and that the Japanese had expressed a more reasonable attitude than before, the American newspapers praised General Cai Tingkai en masse and expressed admiration. Today's editorial in the New York Times stated that General Cai Tingkai and the Nineteenth Route Army should be given primary credit for causing the Japanese to change their attitude, willing to start negotiations, and trend towards peace. The Nineteenth Route Army forcefully held back the Japanese army, which continuously reinforced near the public concession, forcing the Japanese warlords to expose their disregard for the interests of others to the world, and also made the Japanese people seriously doubt whether the gains and losses of their military strategy were commensurate. General Cai's bright and brilliant resistance really gave the Japanese warlords the opportunity to express their intentions, which have consumed Japan's unlimited credibility, and gave world public opinion ample time to express its support for Secretary of State Stimson's American policy statement and the power of the League of Nations. A commentary in the New York Evening Post also stated that regardless of the final outcome of this Shanghai war, the most prominent phenomenon is the Chinese army's strength against a powerful enemy. General Cai Tingkai has already provided the Chinese soldiers with a complete development of the essential component of a soldier, namely "leadership ability." (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Finnish Revolution Fails</h3>
<p>Government Issues Arrest Warrants for Revolutionary Leaders</p>
<p>Helsinki: Today, the Finnish government has issued arrest warrants for the leaders of the Lapua movement, Kosola and Wallenius. It is believed that the two have fled inland. Their Lapua farmers are also collapsing and retreating. However, this time, the government's strong attitude towards the farmers' party rebellion has led to a split in the cabinet. Several cabinet members did not agree with the use of force and have resigned. It is expected that two more will resign soon. According to another dispatch, the Finnish government is strictly censoring news about the Lapua revolutionary movement. Therefore, it is difficult to verify the truth of the official reports that the revolution has failed and the Lapua armed farmers are quickly collapsing. According to reliable private sources, they are maintaining a wait-and-see attitude, awaiting developments, and are still determined to demand the government's resignation and the formation of a conservative cabinet, backed by conservative elements in the parliament. The Lapua farmers still show signs of attempting to attack key points in the capital. (Kuo Min News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The armed Lapua farmers' revolutionary movement in various parts of Finland has clearly failed. According to an official report issued tonight, the Lapua farmers suddenly launched a revolution yesterday afternoon as planned. Armed teams from various places marched towards the capital, Helsinki. According to a declaration by Lapua movement leaders Kosola and Wallenius, the purpose was to overthrow the current government, establish a new government, and eliminate the malpractices of the past thirteen years. Leader Wallenius is the former Chief of Staff of the Finnish Army and participated in the kidnapping of the former Finnish president. He initially achieved some victories in commanding the Lapua farmers in military actions. By this morning, they had advanced to within thirty miles of the capital. Thereupon, the Finnish government immediately declared martial law under the Security of the Republic Act (this law was forced through by the Lapua movement leaders last year to prevent the Communist Party, but now they are hoist with their own petard) and mobilized all the defense forces, sending them to the main roads in and around the capital and setting up barbed wire nets, with light artillery units guarding the rear. Seeing this situation, the Lapua farmers were somewhat discouraged. Wallenius immediately sent five guards to sneak into the government army's defense area to assassinate General Schavoutz, the commander of the capital's defense forces. However, they were discovered by soldiers inside the headquarters and all arrested. Later, Wallenius and Kosola informed the Finnish president by telephone that they were preparing to withdraw their troops and requested a guarantee of personal safety. The president replied that the Lapua leaders would be charged with treason and that no guarantee could be given. It is reported that most of the Lapua farmers had already dispersed that evening and retreated back to their hometowns. The government will arrest the leaders and bring them to justice.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The Constitution of the Spurious State</h3>
<p>▲ The Spurious Capital Is Tentatively Set as Changchun</p>
<p>▲ The People Yearn for the Expedition Against the Rebels by the Main Force</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Pu Yi's representatives Zheng Xiaoxu and Luo Zhenyu arrived in Shenyang on February 23rd and negotiated with Zhang Jinghui and Zang Shiyi about the organization of the puppet Manchukuo independent state. There were still many disputes about who should be the head of state. Zang Shiyi did not approve of the restoration of the monarchy, so he did not agree with Pu Yi as the head of state. Zheng Xiaoxu and others believed that since Pu Yi had to take the stage, the title should be either King or Grand President. At the same time, there were many disputes about whether the capital should be located in Shenyang or Changchun. Japanese propaganda claimed that the capital was set in Changchun, and the former Changchun Municipal Preparation Office, Jilin-Changchun Garrison Headquarters, and the Second Normal School had been selected as the office buildings for the spurious state. Xi Qia had dispatched Zhao Rumei, the chief of the Wei Chun County, to be responsible for the repairs. However, actual investigations revealed that this propaganda was not based on fact.</p>
<p>The constitution of the spurious state has already been drafted. The articles are as follows: Chapter 1: Interim Head of State. Article 1: The Interim Head of State governs Manchukuo. Article 2: The Interim Head of State represents Manchukuo. Article 3: The Interim Head of State is responsible to all the people. Article 4: The Interim Head of State exercises legislative power with the support of the Legislative Yuan. Article 6: The Interim Head of State directs the State Council and exercises executive power. Article 7: The Interim Head of State exercises judicial power through the courts in accordance with the law. Article 8: The Interim Head of State shall maintain and promote public tranquility and welfare, and issue orders or cause orders to be issued for the execution of laws, but shall not change the law by order. Article 9: In order to maintain public safety or to prevent extraordinary disasters, the Interim Head of State may, with the consent of the Council of Senators when the Legislative Yuan is not in session, issue emergency decrees with the same effect as laws, but such decrees must be submitted to the Legislative Yuan in the next session. Article 10: The Interim Head of State shall establish official systems, appoint officials, and determine their salaries, but this shall not apply to basic salaries and other matters specified by law. Article 11: The Interim Head of State has the power to declare war, make peace, and conclude treaties. Article 12: The Interim Head of State commands the army and navy. Article 13: The Interim Head of State can order amnesty, special pardon, commutation of sentence, and restoration of rights. Chapter 2: Council of Senators. Article 14: The Council of Senators is composed of senators. Article 15: The Council of Senators shall provide opinions to the Interim Head of State on the following matters: 1. Laws, 2. Decrees, 3. Budgets, 4. Treaties and agreements with other countries, and declarations to foreign countries in the name of the Interim Head of State, 5. Appointment of important officials, 6. Other important state affairs. Article 16: The Council of Senators shall submit opinions to the Interim Head of State on important state affairs. Chapter 3: Legislative Yuan. Article 17: The organization of the Legislative Yuan shall be determined by another law. Article 18: All bills and budgets must be supported by the Legislative Yuan. Article 19: The Legislative Yuan may make suggestions to the State Council on state affairs. Article 20: The Legislative Yuan may accept petitions from the people. Article 21: The regular session of the Legislative Yuan shall be convened annually for a period of one month, but may be extended if necessary. Article 22: The Legislative Yuan shall not be able to convene without the attendance of at least one-third of the total number of councilors. Article 23: The deliberations of the Legislative Yuan shall be decided by a majority vote of the councilors present. In the event of a tie vote, the speaker shall decide. Article 24: The meetings of the Legislative Yuan shall be open to the public, but closed sessions may be held at the request of the State Council or by a resolution of the Legislative Yuan. Article 25: The bills and budgets passed by the Legislative Yuan shall be approved by the Interim Head of State and promulgated for implementation. When the Legislative Yuan rejects a bill or budget, the Interim Head of State shall indicate the reasons for reconsideration. If it is still not changed, the Council of Senators shall be consulted to decide whether it is approved or rejected. Article 26: Members of the Legislative Yuan shall not be held responsible within the Yuan for their speeches and votes. Chapter 4: State Council. Article 27: The State Council shall handle all administrative matters under the command of the Interim Head of State. Article 28: The State Council shall consist of ministries of civil affairs, foreign affairs, military affairs, finance, industry, transportation, and justice. Article 29: The State Council shall have a Prime Minister and ministers for each ministry. Article 30: The Prime Minister and the ministers of each ministry may attend meetings of the Legislative Yuan at any time and may speak, but may not vote. Article 31: The Prime Minister shall countersign laws, decrees, and edicts of the State Council. Chapter 5: Control Yuan. Article 32: The Control Yuan shall exercise control and adjudication. The organization and functions of the Control Yuan shall be determined by law. Article 33: The Control Yuan shall have supervising officials. Article 34: Supervising officials and adjudicating officials shall not be dismissed, suspended, or have their salaries reduced, except by criminal judgment or disciplinary action.</p>
<p>The National Defense Force of the spurious state is set to be three divisions, with one division stationed in each of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, with Japanese serving as instructors and staff officers. However, this news comes from the Japanese side. It is still doubtful whether Zhang Jinghui in Liaoning has already reached a resolution with Zhao Xinbo and his cohorts. The people of Northeast China are eagerly anticipating Zhang Xueliang's counterattack day and night, believing that it is best to eliminate the spurious state before it fully emerges. Once the main force moves, even though Ma Zhanshan has already surrendered to the Japanese, he can still be driven by his conscience to rebel. Li Du, Ding Chao, and others can also concentrate their forces and go straight to Harbin. The righteous volunteers in northern Manchuria will also be ready to rise up.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a possibility of recovering the situation in Northern Manchuria in one fell swoop. Otherwise, if we delay and make mistakes, the future will be even more pessimistic.</p>
<p>Under the initiative of the spurious municipal government, various organizations in this area held a celebration meeting for the establishment of the spurious state at the Nangang Ritual Ground on the 25th. All agencies and legal entities were forced to have at least one person participate. All participants wore armbands of water-red cloth with the words "Celebration Meeting" or "Harbin People's Lantern Parade." Although merchants were unwilling, they had to submit due to the pressure of high-handed forces, standing in the square and listening to the fallacies of the so-called new regime. The chairman, the spurious mayor Bao Guancheng, and the special police chief Wang Ruihua also took great pains to take care of the situation in person. At noon, they paraded along the streets. Many people secretly dispersed during the parade, and not many remained at the end point. In the evening, another lantern parade was held, but even fewer people participated. (February 27)</p>
