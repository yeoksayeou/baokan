<p>時評</p>
<h3>禦侮興國之先例㈡彬</h3>
<p>昨評吾人已以新土耳其爲例。指陳我民族今後之出路矣。今請更以高唱大希臘主義大舉侵犯土耳其之希臘爲例。以測日本之將來。</p>
<p>希臘於一八三○年脫離土耳其而獨立。及國基漸固。即高唱大希臘主義。力圖擴張其國土。如地中海東巴爾幹及愛琴海對岸之小亞細亞各地。都爲希臘所埀涎。此與　本今日之高唱大陸政策。由呑併台灣朝鮮。進窺我東北。其貪婪驕恣。蓋如出一轍。</p>
<p>然而苦戰三年。希臘終於敗衂。夷考其失敗之因。其主要者。一爲經濟困難。二爲外交失敗。三爲政變影響。四爲軍心不固。凡此四端。居一必敗。希皆有。之故其一敗塗地。爲必然之結局。</p>
<p>希臘之覆轍。既已指陳如前。以希例日。則無一不酷肖。而日之貪橫。則固遠過於希也。希致敗之四因。以言經濟困難。則日本自滬變發生以來。敗政亦陷於大混亂之境。如東京時事新聞所載。股票。國債。生絲。棉絲市塲大暴落。匯兌行市。對美大激漲。產業界陷入萬分危險之境。海外貿易一落千丈。國家財政。已無辦法。滬變發生。復突增軍費四千萬元。益以總選舉費等。臨時之支出。深感羅掘俱窮。不得不在公債方面籌劃。但國民對於國債。前此已每人分担一百零六元之鉅數。萬萬無力負担。未來難關。當可想見。以言外交。日本之恣意橫行。目無世界。早爲列國所側目。自九一八以來。决然破壞遠東和平。予全人類以迫害。更昌言不諱。以美與蘇聯爲假想敵。與國既少。嫉視者多。此次國聯突然强硬勸告日本。注意其對於盟約應負之義務。及滬變後國際之一般輿論。即可知日本在外交上已陷入孤立之地位。以言政變。則一月五日若　被毆。一月九日晚井上被剌以及官僚派與軍人派之爭持亦足以證明其國内政爭之日益激烈。以言軍心。則自日軍來滬後。非戰空氣。彌漫全國。一月九日紀元節。明治大學學生與神田區羣衆之反對軍閥。反對進攻中國之示威運動。以及神户海員工人之罷工示威運動。益以連年歉收。供需缺乏。人心惶惶不定。軍心不固。亦正與希臘毫無二樣。不僅此也。日軍久疏戰陣。外强中乾。國内思想激化。階級對立。其本身已自百孔千瘡。難以收拾。况彼航海來攻。我坐抗禦。勞逸之勢。既相懸殊。而彼曲我直。則更爲兵家所最忌。故以希例日。就前者而觀。日固無勝利之理。就後者而觀。則日更不得不敗。事事歷。歷瞭若指掌。我國今日。但須一致團結。持久抗禦。希土苦戰三年。國人其努力爲之</p>
<p>上海事件</p>
<h3>昨晚敵軍全線潰退</h3>
<p>我軍血戰竟日空前大捷　　廟行鎭一役斃敵三千餘　　敵萬餘在金穆宅被包圍　　敵退入虹口秩序大混亂　　自一月二十八日、日軍突然進攻我閘北吳淞以來、迭次總攻、先後慘敗、於是數萬陸軍增援來滬、由植田新司令指揮之下、向我提出哀的美敦書、於二十日晨七時二十分下總攻擊令、連日激戰、敵復失敗、昨晨三時許、敵又變更戰略、以二萬大軍猛攻我廟行鎭、萬餘人攻江灣鎭、六千餘人攻八字橋經我軍迎頭痛擊、廟行鎭方面雖衆寡懸殊、我軍抱必死之心、無不心一當十、激戰數小時、敵終不得逞、至昨晨十時、形勢突告緊張、敵進攻益猛、我軍勢殊急迫、至十二時、我援軍大集、出奇兵抄敵後路、局勢遂安、雙方肉搏血戰、激戰之烈、較諸曹家橋一役尤甚、下午五時後、敵傷亡三千餘人、軍無鬥志、紛紛潰退、江灣八字橋方面之敵、亦先後被我擊敗、昨晚八時、敵萬餘人、在江灣鎭以北、廟行鎭以東之金穆宅地方、被我軍大包圍、敵并力突圍、終未得逞、預料今晨當可解决、殘餘之敵於昨晚九時後、遂沿江灣鎭、廟行鎭、八字橋、等防綫、全線總退却、我軍乘勝追擊、斃敵無算、敵紛紛逃入租界、由狄思威路平凉路後退、集中於匯山碼頭、虹口區域、以敵之無秩序奔竄、一時陷於大混亂、我軍先鋒部隊到達狄思威路、岳州路、沈家灣、等處、可謂作戰以來、空前之大捷、與敵軍以最重大之敎訓、</p>
<h3>江灣方面戰况</h3>
<p>廟行鎭斃敵三千餘　　金穆宅敵受大包圍　　昨晚九時敵總退却　　虹口一帶混亂不堪　　敵軍自連日傾其全力、向江灣鎭進攻、迭受重創後、乃於前日午夜、又復變更計劃、昨晨集中二萬大軍猛攻我廟行鎭、一萬人進攻我江灣鎭之正面、六千餘人攻我八字橋、竭全力向我衝擊、我軍沉着應戰、激戰至下午五時後、敵大部份在江灣之北、廟行鎭之東金穆宅地方、被我軍全部包圍、餘衆全線總退却、我軍乘勝追擊、斃敵無算、茲將昨日江灣廟行鎭等處、我軍激戰殺敵詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<h3>敵軍分三路進兵</h3>
<p>敵以攻擊江灣鎭失利、遂又變更作戰計劃、於昨晨三時許、分三路進兵、猛攻我廟行鎭、計第一路由江灣分一部份兵力向西北開進、第二路調駐薀藻浜全部敵軍向西、南第三路由張華浜向南北、集中二萬大軍、攻擊我廟行鎭、敵之預備隊、亦全部開赴前線作戰、薀藻浜張華浜方面、僅留二三百人防守、</p>
<h3>廟行鎭空前血戰</h3>
<p>敵軍二萬集中於廟行鎭方面後、即用鐵甲車坦克車卅餘輛、在猛烈砲火下、掩護衝鋒、企圖一舉佔領、故其來勢之猛烈、爲開戰以來所僅見、幸經我軍步哨、察覺甚早、當即奔回報告、全體準備、俟其來近、即由當前之軍隊、奮力還擊、同時並由左右突出、向敵軍側面夾擊、并包抄其後、加以圍攻、惟敵軍來意、頗存奢望、故亦極力掙扎、作困獸之鬥、戰至昨日拂曉、短刃相接、完全肉搏、其後敵漸不支、二次又調集後方部隊、加入作戰、亡命猛攻、雙方混戰肉搏、激戰之猛烈、較諸曹家橋一役尤甚、同時敵機數架、亦飛翔空際、頻向我軍陣地抛擲炸彈、並以機關槍助戰、我軍以司空見慣、兀不爲動、但敵衆我寡、實力相去懸殊、至十時後、頗現危急之象、幸將士抱必死之心、無不以一當十、勇猛抵禦、至十二時、我援軍大至、出奇兵包抄敵軍後路、於是始轉危爲安、敵軍驟出不意、死傷無算、敵陣線遂大搖動、此時日飛機增至十餘架、向我陣地投彈如雨、我軍以敵勢已衰、遂改守爲攻、左右衝擊、至下午五時、斃敵至三千餘人、敵遂全部潰退、是役我軍大獲全勝、燬滅敵坦克車二輛、俘獲敵鐵甲車一輛、野砲二十餘門槍械無算、</p>
<p>又訊昨晨攻擊廟行鎭方面之敵、經我軍用大包抄戰略、將其陷入重圍、並截斷其連絡後、敵已明知中伏、待欲向後撤退、奈歸路已斷、勢難倖免、而殿後少數之敵、目覩前面之敵、已被悉數圍困垓心、無法應援、遂利用氣壓低降、大放烟幕彈、掩護退却、致使數千被圍之敵、陷於苦戰、而悉數被殲、聞是役、較之前日敵偷渡薀藻浜全軍覆没於曹家橋時、爲尤甚也、</p>
<h3>襲江灣之敵軍慘敗</h3>
<p>昨晨、敵一方面以主力猛攻廟行鎭、同時以萬餘人兵力、攻我江灣鎭之正面、昨晨四時二十分許、敵萬餘人、由持志大學東首突出、憑藉先施足球塲之東圩下、向我猛烈攻擊、携有野砲十五門、馬拖過山砲五尊、當時我軍、伏於淞滬路畔之小溝中、寂然不發一搶、日軍乃衝鋒前進、將抵淞滬路時、我軍乃突起迎擊、同時我美衆祠駐軍、亦聞警包擊、雙方搏鬥至烈、相持甚久、敵另一支隊由小觀園附近向吾猛襲、我軍當其前進時、立即化作散兵綫、將近我戰壕時、乃出而應戰、混亂三小時、此時駐防六三花園之敵軍、聞警衝出援救、而我閘北方面、亦調到援軍、參加作戰、至下午四時、敵傷亡千餘人、紛紛潰退、</p>
<h3>金穆宅之大包圍</h3>
<p>廟行鎭方面及江灣敗退之敝、經我軍追擊、狼狽不堪名狀、至晚間八時、敵萬餘人、在江灣鎭之北、廟行鎭之東、金穆宅地方、全部被我軍包圍、敵雖拚命突圍、終不得逞、預料今晨當可全部解决、</p>
<h3>敵軍全線總退却</h3>
<p>敝大部在金穆宅被我軍大包圍、殘餘部隊、軍無鬥志、經我軍衝攻、防線立潰、昨晚九時、敵沿廟行鎭江灣八字橋等防線、全線總退却、由引翔鄉而至狄思威路、平凉路、在匯山碼頭集合、我軍乘勝追擊、先鋒部隊到達岳州路沈家灣等處、一時虹口區域以敵軍之無秩序總退却、陷於大混亂、我軍爲尊重條約、下令不得衝過租界、否則託庇於租界之敵、昨晚當可得一總解决、</p>
<h3>閘北方面戰况</h3>
<p>我軍砲火猛烈　　敵軍各路皆潰　　馬路均起大火　　閘北方面、昨日均有激烈戰事、自晨至晚、竟日未息、砲火之烈、爲大戰中之第一次、日軍傾其全力、圖攻閘北、均經我軍先後擊潰、並乘勢追擊、於下午三時、我軍已全部挺進、至狄思威路岳州路虹鎭及老靶子路北四川路等處、日兵陣線當即全部總退却、至晚間八時、尙在沿吳淞路閔行路向後奔潰、同時資樂安路、忽起大火、虹口日軍陣綫、因此大亂、至繕稿時、我軍尙在追擊中、我軍後方砲隊、掩護得力、日軍在我砲火威逼之下、竟失其戰鬥力、刻已移向浦江方面敗退、同時、日軍中路線後方、已被我軍阻斷、虹口靶子塲及北四川路底日軍司令部、已無日軍踪跡、茲將昨日閘北方面我軍各路報捷、分誌於次、</p>
<h3>八字橋我軍大捷</h3>
<p>昨晨拂曉、日軍於總攻鎭江灣鎭後、即分重兵、向我八字橋進攻、計有陸軍五千餘名、利用鐵甲車車迫擊砲機關槍在前衝鋒、我軍即奮起迎擊、手溜彈機關槍同時並發、當即斃敵先鋒數十名、嗣敵軍又繼起猛衝、前仆後繼、終以我軍砲火猛烈、未爲所逞、我軍即於斯時反攻、以至肉搏、雙方機關槍迫擊砲、全失其效用、敵旅進旅退、我軍出没於敵陣間、銳不可當、但見我軍到處、敵兵東倒西傾、血花四濺、我軍愈戰愈勇、敵軍已無抵禦能力、乃漸漸向虹口花園方面潰退、我軍即乘勝追擊、沿途在靶子場·施高塔路·又起激戰、但敵氣已餒稍抗即潰、至下午三時許、我軍已達狄思威路、我後方部隊、亦呼應而進、至四時許、我軍最前綫、達岳州路、至六時許、已趨虹鎭、於是該路日軍陣綫、全部被我軍擊潰、同時竇樂安路突起大火、虹口一帶、日軍秩序頓時大亂、狼狽逃竄、在八時許、日軍沿吳淞路·閔行路·向浦江方面敗退、我軍尙在追擊中、此役日軍傷亡達二千餘名、我軍傷百餘名、已送醫院救治、</p>
<h3>虬江路又報殲敵</h3>
<p>日軍於進攻八字橋後、繼即向虬江路·福生路·進攻、計達千餘人、惟此處街道縱橫、故非有精密之佈置、决難應付、我軍利於巷戰、且防守得宜、以致日軍屢攻屢敗、當日軍進攻時、係分兩路進犯、一自虬江路、一自邢家宅路、我軍於該處久有重兵、當亦分兩路回擊、雙方均在夾弄間、衝鋒肉搏、機關槍·迫擊砲·居高臨下、尤使敵兵心寒、故未幾敵兵已死亡盈百、其後部隊、正擬退走、我軍即乘機衝進、於是兩路敵軍、同時退至北四川路、我軍會合、追達虬江路口、乃向老靶子路進攻、日軍處斯絕境、回軍頑抗、至午後一時許、敵全部覆滅、至三時許、因悉我軍一路已達狄思威路、乃繼續向虹口腹地推進、同時我後方砲隊、用砲掩護、於晚間十時許、此路我軍前綫、已達沈家灣、進逼吳淞路、與岳州路我軍會合、</p>
<h3>天通庵路之截擊</h3>
<p>昨日、我兩路軍擊敗日兵、追蹤至虹口區域、時進攻天通庵路之日軍五百餘名、同時被我軍擊潰、向北四川路底司令部退却、我軍遂即進逼、向敵司令部圍擊、至下午四時許、敵軍即放棄退出、但我軍並不佔據、仍向北四川路追擊、因此虹口方面敵軍受圍、全部奔潰、</p>
<h3>日軍奔潰之狼狽</h3>
<p>昨晚日軍因受我軍四面追擊、以致秩序大亂、潰不成軍、紛向吳淞路·七浦路·閔行路·等處四散奔逃、沿途並將槍械棄去、希圖混入民房、時有一部份日軍、於敗退至七浦路時、駐防該處之美兵、見來勢不佳、亟發砲四下示威、日軍乃即散逃、但在中途、即被我軍殲滅、</p>
<h3>竇樂安路之大火</h3>
<p>昨日下午一時許、兩軍激戰最烈砲彈橫飛、滿街咸是、老靶子路上海療養院三樓、被砲彈擊中、沈家灣救火會後門及西隊員宿舍前門、均中彈破裂、又昨晚九時後、北四川路大德里·竇樂安路·及狄思威路·福生路·一帶發生大火、</p>
<h3>吳淞方面戰况</h3>
<p>日艦一艘被我軍擊傷　　敵兩次攻薀藻浜未逞　　昨日上午、敵軍艦及飛機、均向我吳淞砲台進攻、仍不得逞、且被我軍擊傷軍艦一艘、薀藻浜方面、昨晨一時許、敵軍曾向我陣地進攻兩次、均被我軍擊退、敵軍並受重創、至上午十時許、敵方有鐵甲車在薀藻浜正面進犯數次、亦終不得逞、茲將戰况詳情紀述如下、</p>
<h3>敵艦一艘被擊傷</h3>
<p>昨日上午、有敵軍艦十餘艘、在口外用重砲向吳淞砲台猛攻、同時並有飛機多架、在空中助戰、我軍亦還砲抵抗、激戰約一小時、敵艦一艘、被我砲彈擊中要害、該艦受傷時、立向左右擺動不已、大有沉没之勢、旋被敵艦四艘保護退去、餘艦亦向長江方</p>
<h3>吳淞中國公學宿舍被日砲轟燬（李尊庸攝）</h3>
<p>面駛去、敵機見勢、遂向楊樹浦方面飛去、又一報告稱、昌興公司坎拿大皇后號、昨由香港來滬、停泊吳淞、未曾進口、往來旅客、由公司派小火輪接送、據送客輪之舟子還滬者言、該船駛入浦江時、見有日本軍艦八艘、在下午二時起、又駛至吳淞、集中火力、對我砲台轟擊、開出砲彈、在空中即開花、儼如一盞明燈、落地時再炸、但亂放至一小時半、因攻擊毫無效力、後經我軍還發數砲、日艦便倉皇逃退、到石頭沙海面抛泊、</p>
<h3>敵兩次進攻失敗</h3>
<p>駐紥淞南黑橋及周家浜口之日軍、於昨日上午一時、向西猛衝直至季家橋南首尼姑菴地方、爲我軍擊退、至天將黎明、又作第二次衝鋒、我軍初則沉着不戰、俟其逼近我軍防線時、一聲令下、以大包圍勢將日軍包在垓心、遂以大刀隊上前將日軍砍死二百數十名、餘均不支而退、</p>
<h3>敵甲車向我射擊</h3>
<p>昨日上午張華浜方面之敵軍、每隔十數分鐘開放大砲、向我軍陣地轟擊、間或開放機關槍、然純係敵軍示威作用、絕無目標、我軍一無損害、故並不還擊、上午八時許、有敵機三架、飛至我軍各處陣綫偵察、未抛擲炸、不久即向南而去、十時許敵軍有十二號鐵甲車一輛、自張華浜海軍醫院方面循軍工路直衝至距薀藻浜新大橋約百碼處、發射機關槍、當被我軍擊退、不久該鐵甲車去而又來、復被我軍擊退、如是者四五次、復有京滬鐵路Ｂ字損壞機車頭一輛、竟爲敵軍修好、昨日下午一時許、經敵兵駕駛在兩路工廠至張華浜分路中間之軌道上往來開行、現張華浜方面敵軍、大部均被調赴侯家木橋廟行一帶、故人數已不滿二三百人、兩路工廠附近各處、幾不見敵兵踪影、</p>
<h3>吳淞劇戰之補紀</h3>
<p>吳淞張華浜日軍忽於前日（二十）天明時、發海陸空三路重兵、猛攻吳淞、三次衝鋒、均未得逞、被我軍擊退、茲錄詳情如次、是日天明時、忽有日艦三艘、一泊於砲臺南首呆猪熬油作浦濱、一泊於薀藻浜口、一泊於糧米碼頭、三艦發砲、向吳淞攻擊、同時薀藻浜南之日陸軍、以大砲掩護、向淞猛攻、我軍沉着不應、俟敵軍已近、開放步槍機關槍掃射、其時日飛機十餘架、分作數隊、每隊三隻、用炸彈機關槍向下轟炸、其時海陸空三軍猛攻、我軍奮勇抵禦、遂開空前未有之大劇戰、初次猛攻、互戰至十點鐘時、始被我軍擊退、下午二時、砲聲復起、日空陸兩軍、均集中於薀藻浜一帶進攻、至四點鐘、日軍因死傷頗衆、仍爲我軍擊退、當晚八時、日軍又圖作第三次之攻擊、仍歸失敗而退、至昨晨零時、日軍竟派陸戰隊三四千爲總攻擊、向薀藻浜進截吳淞、經我軍拚死抵禦、巷戰至三時餘、日軍死傷過半、不支而退、據目覩者云、是役戰爭最烈、險爲敵軍衝入、幸我軍十分奮勇、始將日軍擊退、誠萬幸也、</p>
<h3>楊行擊落敵機</h3>
<p>楊行西顧家宅附近東六地方、前日午後二時許、忽有日軍偵察機一架、盤旋於該鄉空際、偵察我軍狀况、適爲駐紮該處之軍隊、開槍擊中、墮落於地、機身震碎、機内祗有機師一人、奄奄一息、已將埀斃、當爲某兵士開放兩槍、結果性命、後將屍拖出、該機師身軀肥白異常、</p>
<h3>淞鎭市方盡被毀</h3>
<p>二十日日艦開砲轟擊吳淞時、外馬路一樂天茶社、首當其衝、着砲後、遂即延燒、加之日機抛擲硫磺彈、並且東南風猛烈、因此一發竟不可收拾矣、自一樂天向西延燒華昌米行·永泰生煤炭行·公記竹行·火油行·木行等、直至西首油車碼頭、裏街豈市路·則同升臘燭店·某京貨店·麵店·春和館·菜館·荳腐店·張家麵店·糖坊·吳正友米店·及顧明華老虎灶·小麻子·小茶館·迤西直燒至西安路三益路口、共燒兩畫夜之久、火勢之盛、殊覺少有、以致外馬路西半段及荳市路一帶房屋、悉成灰燼、慘酷空前罕有、此次一燒、吳淞全鎭已去其九矣、恐完好者尙不足一成之數耳、</p>
<h3>廟行大勝捷報</h3>
<p>淞滬警備司令部捷電　　淞滬警備部捷報云、提前發限即到、洛陽行政院南京軍政部衛戍長官公署鈞鑒、各綏靖公署各省市政府各機關各報館均鑒、敵於本晨午前三時、以全力向我閘北江灣廟行一帶陣地猛攻、經我軍夾擊、激戰至現在、陣地前方、敵傷亡已逾三千、潰不成軍、刻我軍正在追擊中、謹此捷聞、淞滬警備司令部參謀處叩養戍印、</p>
<h3>十九路軍戰訊</h3>
<p>十九路軍部二十二發（第一次）戰訊、㈠日軍連日發現非戰宣傳品極多、軍中發現不安狀態、士氣大受影響、㈡昨（二十一）日敵人以全力攻我江灣、雙方搏戰猛烈、我方殺敵神勇、敵終不得逞、外報記者傳江灣失守、絕無其事、晚間敵人進攻、已比較和緩、而我軍向敵砲攻多命中、㈢昨（二十一）日吳淞口有敵艦十一艘、會同飛機多架來攻、交戰移時、敵艦一艘、爲我軍砲中要處、由敵艦四艘保護退却、餘六艘向長江方面逸去、㈣昨（二十一）日日軍竟日以坦克車大砲及步兵數千、向我江灣方面進攻、結果敵坦克車傷二輛逃去、敵軍死傷千餘人、敵以不得逞、故今晨（二十二）轉向廟行鎭進攻我軍、刻雙方在接觸中、</p>
<h3>日軍技窮飛機散僞傳單</h3>
<p>詆毀十九路軍　　藉圖挑撥離間　　昨日下午二時半、有日飛機三架、盤旋於市政府附近、散發似通非通之中文傳單、冒用中央黨部名義、詆毀第十九路軍、不受中央節制、擅向日軍開戰、藉圖挑撥離間、聞閘北眞茹各處、同時亦發現同樣傳單甚多、茲經覓得一紙、爲特製版如左、吾人一觀、當不難知其爲日人之詭計也、第十九路軍不奉党國之命独擅向日軍開業籍使良民痛受塗炭之苦實爲無理己極本党絕對反對與日軍開戰打倒第十九路連軍國民党中央党部</p>
<h3>西報所紀戰况</h3>
<p>我軍改守爲攻大美晚報云、江灣陣線之第十九路軍鏖戰三日、今晨（二十二）忽改守爲攻、衝擊江灣東面與北面之日軍陣地、日軍節節退走、其砲隊恐擊中自己之隊伍、多未發砲、故雙方多用肉搏、華軍用手榴彈炸彈來福槍剌刀奮勇前撲、直至將到江灣跑馬塲時始已、日軍第九師團大舉進攻江灣、今已第三日、而仍不出星期六日所佔之陣地、第十九路軍堅守江灣鎭、其抵抗力非常强硬、加以善於壕戰、故日軍不得不源源調援、開赴前線、凡楊樹浦路一帶及其他地點各營之陸軍、幾已調空、而以陸戰隊塡防、星期六日日軍在其美路安置之野戰砲、今日已移置江灣砲馬場之東南隅、今日正午時曾發砲不已、陣後半哩許、有六時口徑之大砲四尊助之、而跑馬場西面與西南面亦聞輕砲聲、華軍方面之砲手曾覓得日砲所在、以三時口徑之砲彈數枚擊中其地、目下江灣跑馬場僅駐日步兵兩三中隊、餘多爲日方之紅十字會中人、晨間砲聲殊稀、但至正午後、復向華軍陣線猛轟、故在下午、砲聲隆隆不絕、植田之司令部、原設復旦大學、今據日軍官聲稱、已移至跑馬場西面之天樂寺宅、大美晚報訪員竭力欲覓得其所在、未果、自跑馬場觀臺瞭望、見西北面與西面之村中有兩處大火、而兩處之機關槍聲皆甚猛厲、足證華軍仍在奮力遏止敵軍之前進也、江灣跑馬總會前空場上之日坦克車三輛、向午時又增一輛、車身彈孔纍纍、又張華浜有鐵甲車一輛開出、旋停於江灣路與翔殷路交叉點處、其車頭之燈、已被彈擊碎、</p>
<h3>吳淞日兵單薄</h3>
<p>大美晚報云、駐張華浜之日陸軍第二十四旅、悉數調</p>
<p>往江灣作戰、致張華浜日守軍、兵力單薄、連今晨登陸之水兵計之、大約僅有二百名、加以日驅逐艦夕張號及其他六艦均已駛離該處、故日軍益覺震恐、深虞薀藻浜北之華軍渡河襲擊、故今晨（二十二）日兵紛紛在通鐵路工塲之各要點開掘戰壕、作種種防禦設施、現工塲西面槍聲甚厲、足證華軍已漸逼近張華浜、今日侵晨、日軍艦又轟擊吳淞砲臺片刻、此次乃在揚子江口發砲、而非如星期六與星期日之在浦江中矣、</p>
<h3>中國步兵優勢</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨（廿一）據前線某軍官說明、中國軍隊不</p>
<p>欲據守江灣跑馬塲原因、謂該塲一片平曠、易爲日軍砲火之鵠的、不若江灣鎭有許多房屋、與閘北形勢相同、易守難攻、祇須後方交通線不斷、足以拒退敵人之進攻、即令萬一後方交通線截斷後、苟日人不願重大犧牲、亦仍可扼守、又據某中立觀察家竟見、此次日砲隊自二十日上午七時至二十一日正午止、向江灣鎭連續猛轟、而效力極有限、現該處戰事、必須仍以步兵居重要地位、但中國步兵實優於日、觀於日軍步隊雖有砲火之掩護、仍遂巡不敢前進、可見中國步兵之精練</p>
<h3>彈藥難勝人力</h3>
<p>大美晚報云、外人之觀戰者現信日軍處現在之地位、繼續砲轟、徒耗彈藥、難奏膚功、雖日軍有飛機以炸彈猛轟、可爲援助、然戰至後來、終必以短兵相接、此則將賴人力以搏勝矣、</p>
<h3>進口輪船受驚</h3>
<p>字林報云、昨日（二十一）吳淞自拂曉以後、復有猛烈之砲轟、據日人聲稱、中國軍隊企圖渡河</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>襲攻張華浜鐵路工廠日軍司令部、但最後仍爲日軍驅逐艦及輕砲隊所擊退、嗣乃連戰數小時、當上午九時三十分砲火正猛烈時、怡和之降和輪船由長江進口、駛過火線、一彈飛來、適落船旁、江水激起、濺及甲板、又有數彈、自上飛過、幾及船艙、一時乘客船員爭相匿伏、該輪急開足機力、幸旋即安然駛過火線、其後又有招商輪兩艘、見英船危險狀、仍折回口外</p>
<h3>日報評我國軍隊精神</h3>
<p>不放日本兵在限中　　是我軍大無畏精神　　何錯誤之有　　日本報知新聞十八日載上海大槻特派員電云、自一月廿八日夜半衝突以來、中國軍究竟死傷若干、絕難查訪、但中國正規兵之夜襲反攻、便衣隊之機敏狡猾、以及十九路軍的猛烈抵抗等、與我輩（日人）在未戰以前所預料「支那兵一戰即逃」的觀念、適成反比例、故予就其原因、特加研究、原來中國南方之軍隊、皆不明日本兵之威力、而指導彼等之將校、又藐視我國（日本）之海軍、甚至將日本兵不放在眼中、此是中國將校一種錯誤的優越威、然則推究其所以如此者、率因中國的十條軍隊敎育精神、有以造成者也、即一不怕死二·不貪財三·要耐勞苦四·愛名譽知恥辱五·嚴守三民主義與紀律、六·犧牲私見、七·愛護人民、八·忠實職務、九·團結精神、十·絕滅殺人放火的共黨、打倒帝國主義、以上十條、每日由將校口授兵卒、中國兵熟諳牢記、因此各兵土均能奮勇上前、與敵軍對抗、所以今日吾人不但不可輕視其軍隊、且甚可供我軍（日軍）之參考耳、</p>
<h3>日人謂我軍作戰巧妙</h3>
<p>日本報知新聞十七日號外載聯合社會云、坂井少尉指揮下之將校步哨兵、乘十五日黑夜、由我吳淞最左翼線（日軍陣地）出發、在東家宅附近詳細偵察敵陣狀况、就敵軍（我軍）之猛烈發射情形、仔細觀察、實爲可驚、至十六日未明、偵探完畢、歸隊報告云、在饅頭山有一等兵莊野屋實、（日兵）彈貫胸腹、已無可救、是時記者亦在最前線詳細偵察、眼見敵之有力大隊渡吳淞河、聯絡其他部隊、以距離西方約距二千米突之楊家宅爲中心、前後左右、皆建築强固之陣地、並於各陣線、架設百連發之機關槍、且由右側陣地至對岸東家宅吳淞河浜之砲台、作長蛇形、敵兵充滿陣地、土氣旺盛、予（日記者）望而生畏、魂膽俱裂云、</p>
<h3>美兵讚華兵神勇</h3>
<p>大美晚報云、星期日有在北站第八號鐵門旁放哨之美兵、述一華兵神勇事、據稱當星期六之晨、界路附近所駐日兵、向界路中國兵陣線攻擊、華兵所設鐵絲網爲砲火所損、即有一少年兵士、自陣線躍出、加以修理、當爲日兵瞥見、立開機關槍掃射、其人應聲而倒、但倏忽之間、復有第二兵士自沙袋後飛奔而出、匍匍前進、欲曳回同伴、無如敵方機槍猛烈、背上衣服立爲子彈所洞穿、該兵見情勢危險萬分、急奔往附近烟紙店内、其地當兩軍陣線之間、但爲日方子彈所不及、該兵雖稍負傷、而神色自若、見其安坐洋台、靜觀作戰、並開留聲機以自娱、於是歷二十餘小時、迨至深夜、始乘間匍匍奔回本陣云、</p>
<h3>日機昨又到處擲彈</h3>
<p>彭浦閘北擊損日機　　燬民房傷鄉人甚多　　昨日天明後、即有日機二十餘架、飛往我軍前方後方各地擲彈、直至天晚方止、茲向各方調查所得、分誌於後、</p>
<h3>閘北</h3>
<p>昨日上午八時後、日機六架、飛至閘北八字橋·天通庵·虬江路·等處擲彈助戰、并頻開機槍、向我軍進攻、我軍以高射砲機槍還擊、即向西飛去、旋即又至八字橋附近擲彈十餘枚、炸燬民房十餘間、炸傷江北貧民四人、有二架飛行甚低、被我軍以步槍擊損一架、該機受傷後、險致落地最後掙扎向東逃去、其餘亦紛紛飛去、</p>
<p>又訊、昨日下午三時許、閘北炒米浜、被敵方大彈轟毀我平房十餘間、當塲炸死江北婦人二名、又江北人吳發興、被炸去兩手一足、後腦半部被彈片炸去、當即殞命、血肉模糊、慘不忍賭、又同時共和新路夏家弄遭暴日飛機擲下炸彈一枚、炸斃男子二名、姓名未詳、</p>
<h3>彭浦</h3>
<p>昨日上午八時日機三架、飛至彭浦、約一時餘、即行他去、未擲炸彈、三時後、日機十餘架、又至該鎭、在北首二里許之張家宅念八圖等村莊、擲彈五枚、炸燬民房七八間、傷鄉民十餘人、并開機槍、向我民衆掃射、一時附近民衆、均紛紛逃避、日機一架、被我軍高射砲擊、燬右翼一部、立即向東逃去、其他各機、亦皆飛行他去云、</p>
<h3>眞茹</h3>
<p>眞茹·南翔·瀏河一帶、昨日亦有敵機飛到、其時約在下午一時左右、惟均飛行甚高、察其用意似在窺探一切、眞茹方面、當敵機來時、約有三隊、每隊三架或兩架不等、且飛且鳴機槍示威、但吾軍早有防範、亦以機槍及高射砲報之、並有吾方空軍出而應戰、日機不敵、紛紛逃逸、又有昨往大塲戰區視察者、見前日擊落之日機一架、尙在道左、機身極大、三飛機師之屍均在機内、前面一人、後面二人、均黃帽黑軍衣、尙有六百磅炸彈四個未炸、</p>
<h3>日報通訊員受傷</h3>

<p>吳淞民房被日機炸燬（李尊庸攝）</p>
<h3>昨又運到日本援軍</h3>
<p>日軍司令植田、因總攻以來、屢次大敗、第九師團死亡甚夥、急電東京、續派援兵來滬、陸軍省、調派某師團來滬援助、第一批遣發者、業於前日午後、由運送船春日丸長洋丸兩輪、星夜趕裝來滬、於昨下午五時到此、額不過四五千名、番號無從探悉、</p>
<p>大美晚報云、據可靠方面消息、今日（二十二日）午後、復將有日本陸軍兩師團由日抵滬、聞其中一師團將在浦東登岸、今日所將開抵之二師團、聞其一爲日陸軍第一師團、乃在東京募集者、</p>
<h3>日軍使用毒彈</h3>
<p>敵又狡賴誣衊　　大陸報云、日前紅十字會報告日軍使用國際禁用之達姆達姆彈後、日總領事村井即發聲明書、加以否認、翌日紅十字會醫院德國醫生皮姆博士曾在歐戰中獲有豐富經騐、復致函院長、詳述在華兵傷處檢獲達姆達姆彈片情形、旋中國代表亦在國聯理事會聲明日軍使用國際禁品事實、乃昨日（二十一）日軍島田少將在旗艦出雲接見外報記者、仍鄭重否認日軍使用達姆達姆彈、且反稱中國軍隊使用達姆達姆彈、並出子彈作爲證據、但該彈究於何處檢獲、及日兵有無中彈者、則島田俱未說明、（譯者按日人之善於狡賴誣衊、可謂無所不至、但日人既有此謊言、難保其不再向國外撒謊宣傳、我國似亦宜有所聲辯也、）</p>

<h3>顧維鈞告歐美人民書</h3>
<p>國民新聞社云、顧維鈞氏、應美國聯合通訊社之請、向歐美各國人民、發表英文談話、業經該社於昨日電達各國報館、茲覓載譯文於左</p>
<p>顧氏之言曰、現在日本畢竟將他的假面具揭穿、而與世界挑戰矣、此次日本以哀的美頓書送致我國、不啻對世界正式聲明、對華作挑釁的戰爭、並欲繼續作戰、即全世界之輿論、一致反對、亦所不顧、本月二十日早晨、到了這充滿惡兆的鐘點、僅待三十分鐘後、日本的全副作戰工具、已經完全開始動作了、他的海陸空軍兵力有五萬人、和他的野戰砲重砲坦克車機關槍隊巡洋艦驅逐艦投炸彈的飛機以及其他戰鬥力、同時從水陸兩路、一齊向我進攻、這世人所不願見之血戰、現已在進行之中、而吾國生命財產之損失、又將增加無數矣、試問日本進攻、其目的安在耶、其目的是否在保護日僑耶、在滬的日僑、無論何時、未聞有若何重大的危險、然而日本藉保僑爲名、其海陸空軍、竟殺戮了我國平民及兵士數千人、並毀壞了無數的吾國財產、且自日本在滬尋釁以後、他們自己的軍隊、至少亦死了二千人、此種作戰、豈非一種侵略的戰爭耶、吾們中國人、早知道日本作戰之目的、蓋日本要想做亞洲的盟主、必定要先征服中國、這個夢已經做了不少年數、此次日本侵佔了同德法兩國領土併起來一般大的東三省地方、因歐美各國、並未有何種嚴重切實的反對、又眼見得世界各國自己的對内對外問題、已經忙個不了、是以日本决心的、對我實行侵略、要培植他的勢力於遠東商務金融中心的上海、要佔領爲中國中部門户的吳淞、要佔領管長江進路的吳淞、使以後長江流域一帶的原料及銷售外國貨的富庶市塲、均在他的掌握中了、在中國酷愛和平厭惡戰爭、業已竭智索能的求所以和平解决之道、所以吾中國一面聲訴於國聯及非戰公約九國公約諸籨約國、一面對於第三國政府或代表、所爲停止戰爭和平解决之各項提議無不承受、然而效果乃等於零、舉凡國聯行政院之决議案、各友邦之勸告與抗議、愛好和平的公共團體之籲請、世界上有力的報紙之忠告、大政治家之公正的努力、在日本自恃强權、均若充耳無聞、一意孤行的推行其侵略計劃、現在中國失望之餘、决意以實力抵抗到底、無論何種犧牲、均所不惜、蓋自我國觀之、此種抵抗、實爲國家生死存亡所繫、雖其結果、爲勝爲敗、未可逆料、要爲必不得已面盡力的以實力抵抗也、現今雖無作戰之名、已有作戰之實了、在此槍砲聲中、有思想的人們想起了、無數嚴重的問題、假使中國被日本片服了、誰將繼中國之後而同遭其侵略耶、現在日本橫行、其舉國若狂的征服政策、是否無法可以阻擋耶、全世界維持和平的力量、是否不足以阻遏此種政策之橫行耶、假使日本的軍國主義、可以任令橫行無忌、將愛好和平的民族、任意蹂躪、則此後世界上之前途、又將若何耶、世界上的人類、是否可以任令退化、再受世界大戰之痛苦耶、世界上的文化、是否可以任令退步、而爲强權即公理之願則所支配耶、</p>

<h3>滬領團第三次報告書</h3>
<p>和平談判决裂經過</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　上海領事調查團、係由意大利</p>
<p>代辦及法國·英國·德國·西班牙·挪威各國總領事組織成立、并與美國總領事合作、前於本月六日暨十二日、將第一第二兩次報告書、電達國聯會、茲又於本月二十日將第三次報告書、用電報發出、其全文如次、</p>
<p>中日雙方經中立國外交代表、居中調處、均允召集軍事長官開會、而以雙方退兵爲基礎、從事討論、</p>
<p>此項會議係於二月十八日午前舉行、中日雙方司令官、各派參謀長代表出席、當由日本代表提出條件、中國代表認爲不能接受、討論亘兩小時之久、毫無結果、日本代表謂日方所提條件、將於下午九時以前、用書面通知、並云希望中國速即答復、討論之舉、即此破裂、</p>
<p>下午九時左右、日方將所提條件、分别送達上海市長及十九軍軍長、此項條件、其詞語各有不同、其内容如下、</p>
<p>一、中國軍隊應停止敵對行動、并於二月廿日午前七時、完全退出第一道防線、并於是日午後五時、完全退出第二道防線、至北面廿公里地點、（二十基羅米突包括獅子林砲台在内）即自公共租界暨蘇州河北端、至蒲淞鎭、又自黃蒲江東岸爛泥渡至張家橋（即自蘇州河向東延長之綫、所有撤退區域内之砲台及軍事設施、均須撤除之、並不得從新設立、</p>
<p>二、日本軍隊對於中國軍隊不加攻擊、并不追逐、但得遣派飛機、從事偵查、中國軍隊撤退之後、日本軍隊僅保持虹口附近、工部局築有道路之地域、并虹口公園包含在内、</p>
<p>三、中國軍隊由第一道防線撤退之後、日本軍得派調查員、携帶衛兵及旗幟、前往撤退區域、</p>
<p>四、撤退區域以外、凡日僑生命財產、應由中國負責保其安全、遇必要時、日本當自行採取必要手段、所有便衣隊、均應切實撤銷、</p>
<p>五、上海附近及撤退區域内外人保護問題、將來再議、</p>
<p>六、關於抗日運動、一月十八日上海市長所應允各節、應嚴切實行此事、當由日本外務省與上海中國行政官以外交談判處理之、</p>
<p>以上各欵、若不接受、則日本軍隊不得不自由行動、</p>
<p>次日即二月十九日、中國方面之復文、一方由上海市長送達日本總領事、一方由中國軍隊司令官送達日本軍隊司令官、上海市長於其復文中聲明、上海現在嚴重時局、全由日軍違反一切條約及國際法、侵略中國領土、並慘殺中國人民所致、日本總領事要求各節、直接與中日國交有關、應由兩國外交當局處理、業將日本總領事之函、轉呈中國政府、請其考慮、并經由中國外交部答復日本公使、上海市長又謂、日本軍隊挑撥行爲、繼續不已、致使中國人心、日益憤激、所謂抗日運動、未能停止、乃係自然之理、</p>
<p>中國軍隊司令官之復文、謂所屬軍隊、係國家軍隊之一部份、受國民政府之揩揮、因此日本軍隊司令官來函、業已轉呈國民政府、</p>
<p>至於中國政府如何答復、現尙不知（并不知曾否答復）</p>
<p>二月十九日至二十日之夜、日本軍隊即自公共租界根據地、向前綫增加援兵、並遣派飛機、預行偵察、知中國軍隊未按照日本要求、退出防線、當於二月二十日午前七時、在江灣吳淞兩處、開始攻擊、竟日不停、調查團主席齊亞諾署名（二十二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>國聯特會前途</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政會既已罄其和解中日爭案之努力、一般人對於召集國聯議會特會之機會、遂有種種推測、咸謂三月三日開會之國聯議會、除决定適用第十六條會章對侵略國實施經濟制裁外、别無可異於行政會之行爲（二十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>英人主張列强共同制日</h3>
<p>倫敦　倫敦人士今日批評遠東消息、現覺中國一致團結抵抗日本暴行、某方面豫料將有一種最後辦法、而由英國發起、又有人主張列强會同美國立即行動、以制日本、朝野各方面、現皆亟欲研究最近公報、英相麥唐納刻在别墅、但樞密院長包爾溫日在相邸、而外交海陸三部人員皆不稍離職守、在滬商人兵士等之親友、今日淸晨有若干人集於政府公署之外、以期探聽上海英人有無危險消息、近來頗多關於接濟遠東軍火、但未證實之謠言、任諾爾畫報謂法國現接有日本定購大批軍械之成單云、至於英國刻以大宗彈藥供給中日之說、則已有人駁之、蓋一月份英國彈藥運往世界各處之貿易統計、已表示今年一月比較去年同月已减少十分之五也、（二十一路透社電）</p>
<h3>美政界對滬局仍緘默</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美國政界當局、雖視上海中日爭端、極屬嚴重、但仍緘口不願有所表示、美國駐滬人士、每日將當地戰爭情形、陸續拍至國務院、而國務卿史汀生、對於此種詳細報告、頗爲重視、皆一一親自披覽、而日本繼續派遣援兵接濟上海日軍司令植田消息傳來、各界人士頗爲震動、但國務方面、似不願再於外交方面、有所舉動云、（二十一日國民社電）</p>
<h3>上海英僑必要時將撤退</h3>
<p>英陸相發表談話倫敦　政府對於上海時局、雖仍有緊張氣象、但未覺恐慌、唐寗街在本星期杪有非常之活動、陸相海爾珊與外相西門對於時事之發展、皆有甚密切之接觸、陸相曾稱、如有必要、英僑可退出公共租界、各種佈置皆已完備、但目前並無應可恐慌之事云、英相麥唐納今日午後由别墅返相邸、未幾包爾溫即往與晤談頗久、英相將暫留倫敦辦理公務、俟星期三日復往别墅休養、醫士禁其出席下院、（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<h3>歐洲各國經濟聯盟計畫</h3>
<p>南斯拉夫提出國聯運</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日南斯拉夫以歐洲經濟聯盟切實計劃、提出國際聯盟内稱歐洲人民間某種程度之合作、馴至成立一歐洲整個單獨市塲、實爲圖謀歐洲列邦親善之最良工具、苟欲造成歐洲單獨市塲、有五大要點、㈠關稅聯盟、此事大部份須依靠各强國、㈡歐洲各國間彼此課優惠稅率、對歐洲以外國家、則課進口重稅、㈢財政互助、歐洲各國間彼此以低利貸欵充農工商業用途、㈣由各經濟機關或歐洲國際同業聯盟間、訂立契約、節制生產、㈤組織國際委員會類似近日新組之德法委員會、期於各邦間建立有効的商務與經濟關係、按此項計劃、將交歐洲聯邦委員會議考慮、（二十一日國民社電）</p>
<h3>日官場聲明日軍作戰目的</h3>
<p>（東京）此問官塲謂上海日軍之作戰目的、在沿二十基羅米達陣線逐退第十九路軍、預料需一星期或十日方右達此目的、然後日軍將沿已佔據之陣線改取守勢、俟緊張空氣充分和緩後、或議定暫時中立區域後、日軍始行撤退云、此間當局似以爲苟無意外發展、可無須再派援軍、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）今日朝日新聞載頃由上海來歸之海軍少將Suetgugu之談片、謂上海日軍　取攻勢、以期華軍自動撤退、不意反令華軍固其陣地、而增攻者之困難、此後戰事範圍之大、恐必遠出預料、苟非大增援軍、若取攻勢、殊屬輕率、蓋華軍現逐日增援、其防務日益鞏固也、掌壐大臣牧野伯需今日已赴興津晋謁元老西園公爵、足證當局對於滬局、至爲憂慮、而對於派援問題、意見之分歧、亦顯然可見也、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>法新閣考慮内閣政策宣言</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法國新内閣今晨集議、考慮内閣政策宣言、泰狄歐總理將於明日在國會宣讀之、内閣已贊同總理提出之草稿、明日重行集議時、即可議决、聞其文頗短、注重外交政策、預算事件及失業問題、泰狄歐預料可獲國會大多數贊許、蓋據泰氏宣稱、一俟國會通過、渠即將赴日内瓦、重行指揮參與軍縮大會之代表團也、（二十二日國民社電）</p>
<h3>法國政團開始選舉運動</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法國十七種政團現已開始爲大選舉之運動、法國大選舉之舉行、係在本年五月、而法國國會、此後四年中之組織、亦即由此而决定者也、本年候選議員人數、約在三千五百人以上、而國家主義派、以本年選舉經費充足、現已開始作大規模之競爭、並以軍縮問題爲標榜、全國自大城市以至極小村落、皆可見該黨之宣傳品、主張法國之不應再減少一槍或解散一卒云、（二十一日國民社電）</p>
<h3>日本覆國聯文</h3>
<p>公然蔑棄國聯會章　　（東京）日本對國聯行政院十二理事申請文之覆文、將於今日午後發至日内瓦、將由海外各國日大使署發表、聞文中切實聲明中國騷亂内戰、不時發生、不能視爲有組織的國家、故國聯會章不適用於中國云云、（二十二日路透社）</p>
<p>（東京）日本對國聯申請文、之覆文復展緩發出、預料該文提交内閣後、明日可發、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>上海之砲擊毀國聯結構</h3>
<p>倫敦　每日驛報日内瓦訪電、有上海之砲現擊毀日内瓦國聯結構等語、驛報根據此語撰一社論、謂國聯業已失敗、現亟宜實施會章第十六條云、每日電聞稱美中國軍隊之堅决精神、惟謂日本在軍備上較佔優勢、當可制勝云、該報仍主張英國於維持其國人安全與利益時、應守不干涉政策、又謂在華有條約地位之各國、决計無論當地情勢有何發展、不使發生外人出境之必要云（廿二日路透電）</p>
<h3>英國不欲捲入戰事漩渦</h3>
<p>外相西門答工黨質問　　我軍英勇使英人驚詫　　倫敦　今日下院開會時、工黨議員柯克斯問外相曰、滿洲現組織獨立國、實違背九國條約及國聯會章、政府將取何步驟以對付之乎、西門爵士答曰、日政府之不致承認此新國、當較其他任何政府尤甚、貴議員此問、乃根據於一種推料、余所得消息、未證實之、柯克斯又問政府曾否商諸美國及國聯其他會員之列强、以期對日施外交與經濟壓力、使尊重國際義務之莊嚴、西門答語、復述其前答覆同樣建議之言、謂中日爭案、現由國聯行政會辦理、英政府仍與國聯列强及美國協同行事、西門又謂、雖經各種努力以消弭戰禍、而上海仍發生重大之戰爭、渠實不勝抱憾云、上海英僑婦孺不致有離境之必要、惟當局對此、已作詳細之籌備、西門末謂英使藍溥森已協同法意美代表向中日當局提出抗議、反對似可危害外人生命財產之任何行動（二十二路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　華兵之戰鬥性向爲人所輕視、今竟若是堅忍不屈、實出人意料、衆皆爲之驚訝、嘖嘖稱奇、日軍現遇甚堅强之抵抗、事實日見顯露、衆望此或可使日人提出溫和之要求、而因以與中國締成一種協定、熟悉遠東大局之英人、現皆注意日本因作大規模戰爭消耗之國幣、衆信如華軍能再堅抗數日、則東京必作「第二思想」戰事之慘烈情形、英國雖爲感動、但據最有勢力各機關之意見觀之、英國决計不牽入戰爭漩渦、現各方運動反對實施國聯會章第十六條、以免對日實行經濟制裁、各報多載社論、謂英國方脫離財政紊亂、當竭力避免大規模之海陸軍戰事、蓋此舉除摧殘遠東英國之商業外、且將耗費金錢數百兆磅也、惟自由黨各報仍促勿顧後果如何、而對日實行制裁、孟却斯德指導報痛詆國聯諸政治家「太無胆量不敢試行制裁、轉以自困」彼等緩柔寡斷、致不能集合世界之公輪以抗日、而</p>

<h3>A Precedent for Resisting Aggression and Revitalizing the Nation ㈡彬</h3>
<p>Yesterday's commentary used the example of the new Turkey to point out the future path for our nation. Today, let us take the example of Greece, which loudly advocated the "Great Greece" ideology and launched a major invasion of Turkey, to predict Japan's future.</p>
<p>Greece broke away from Turkey and became independent in 1830. As its national foundation gradually solidified, it began to loudly advocate the "Great Greece" ideology, striving to expand its territory. Regions such as the eastern Mediterranean, the Balkans, and Asia Minor across the Aegean Sea were all coveted by Greece. This is exactly like Japan's current advocacy of its continental policy, from annexing Taiwan and Korea to coveting our Northeast. Its greed and arrogance are virtually identical.</p>
<p>However, after three years of bitter fighting, Greece ultimately failed. Examining the reasons for its failure, the main ones were: first, economic difficulties; second, diplomatic failure; third, the impact of political upheaval; and fourth, the instability of military morale. Any one of these four would lead to defeat, and Greece possessed them all. Therefore, its utter defeat was an inevitable outcome.</p>
<p>Greece's mistakes have already been pointed out. Comparing Japan to the example of Greece, there is nothing that is not remarkably similar. And Japan's greed and recklessness far exceed those of Greece. Regarding the four causes of Greece's defeat, in terms of economic difficulties, Japan's defeated policies, since the Shanghai Incident, have also fallen into a state of great chaos. As reported by the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo, stock prices, national bonds, raw silk, and cotton yarn markets have plummeted. Exchange rates have soared sharply against the US dollar. The industrial sector has fallen into an extremely dangerous situation. Overseas trade has fallen sharply. The national finances are already beyond repair. The Shanghai Incident has suddenly increased military spending by 40 million yuan. In addition, there are temporary expenditures such as the general election expenses, deeply feeling the exhaustion of resources and being forced to plan for public debt. However, the people have already shouldered a huge burden of 106 yuan per person in national debt, and they are completely unable to bear it. The difficulties of the future can be imagined. In terms of diplomacy, Japan's willful and reckless actions, disregarding the world, have long been watched with concern by other nations. Since the September 18th Incident, it has resolutely destroyed peace in the Far East and persecuted all of humanity. It even openly declares the United States and the Soviet Union as hypothetical enemies. It has few friends and many who are jealous. The League of Nations' sudden and strong recommendation to Japan to pay attention to its obligations under the Covenant, and the general international opinion after the Shanghai Incident, show that Japan has fallen into a state of diplomatic isolation. In terms of political upheaval, the assault on Wakatsuki on January 5th, the assassination attempt on Inoue on the evening of January 9th, and the contention between the bureaucratic and military factions are sufficient to prove the increasing intensity of domestic political strife. In terms of military morale, since the Japanese army came to Shanghai, an anti-war atmosphere has permeated the country. The anti-warlord and anti-invasion of China demonstrations by students of Meiji University and the masses in Kanda Ward on the Kigen-setsu (Foundation Day) on January 9th, as well as the strike demonstrations by Kobe maritime workers, coupled with years of poor harvests and lack of supply and demand, have caused widespread public unease. Instability of military morale is also exactly the same as in Greece. Not only that, but the Japanese army has long been out of practice and is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Domestic ideological tensions and class antagonism have already left it riddled with holes and difficult to salvage. Moreover, they are attacking by sea, while we are defending from a fixed position. The disparity in effort and ease is already great. Furthermore, they are in the wrong, and we are in the right, which is most feared by military strategists. Therefore, comparing Japan to the example of Greece, from the former perspective, Japan has no reason to win. From the latter perspective, Japan is even more bound to fail. Everything is clear and apparent. Our country today only needs to unite as one and persist in resisting. Greece and Turkey fought bitterly for three years. The people of the nation should strive to do the same.</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Suffered a Complete Rout Last Night</h3>
<p>Our Army Achieved an Unprecedented Great Victory After a Day of Bloody Battle; Over 3,000 Enemy Troops Killed in the Battle of Miaohangzhen; Over 10,000 Enemy Troops Surrounded at Jinmuzai; Enemy Retreats into Hongkou, Order in Great Chaos; Since January 28th, when the Japanese army suddenly attacked our Zhabei and Wusong, repeated general offensives have resulted in successive crushing defeats. Thereupon, tens of thousands of army reinforcements arrived in Shanghai, and under the command of the new commander Ueda, they presented us with a "Demarche." On the morning of the 20th at 7:20, they issued a general offensive order. After days of fierce fighting, the enemy again failed. Around 3:00 yesterday morning, the enemy again changed its strategy, with 20,000 troops fiercely attacking our Miaohangzhen, over 10,000 attacking Jiangwanzhen, and over 6,000 attacking Baziqiao. After our army met them head-on and dealt them a severe blow, although the disparity in numbers was great in the Miaohangzhen area, our army embraced a determination to die, with each soldier as brave as ten. After several hours of fierce fighting, the enemy ultimately failed to succeed. By 10:00 yesterday morning, the situation suddenly became tense, and the enemy's attacks intensified. Our army's situation was extremely urgent. At 12:00, our reinforcements arrived in large numbers, and launched a surprise attack on the enemy's rear, stabilizing the situation. The two sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat, with the intensity of the battle exceeding that of the Caojiaqiao battle. After 5:00 PM, the enemy suffered over 3,000 casualties, and the troops lost their fighting spirit and retreated in disarray. The enemy in the Jiangwan and Baziqiao areas was also defeated by us one after another. At 8:00 PM last night, over 10,000 enemy troops in the Jinmuzai area, north of Jiangwanzhen and east of Miaohangzhen, were surrounded by our army. The enemy concentrated its forces to break through, but ultimately failed. It is expected that the situation can be resolved this morning. The remaining enemy troops then retreated along the Jiangwanzhen, Miaohangzhen, Baziqiao, and other defense lines, engaging in a full-scale retreat. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, killing countless enemies. The enemy fled into the concession in droves, retreating via Dixiwei Road and Pingliang Road, concentrating at the Wayside Wharf and Hongkou area. Due to the enemy's disorderly rout, the area fell into great chaos for a time. Our army's vanguard units reached Dixiwei Road, Yuezhou Road, and Shenjiawan, which can be said to be an unprecedented great victory since the start of the war, and a most significant lesson to the enemy army.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Jiangwan Area</h3>
<p>Over 3,000 Enemy Killed at Miaohangzhen; Enemy Heavily Surrounded at Jinmuzai; Enemy Full-Scale Retreat at 9 PM Last Night; Extreme Chaos in the Hongkou Area; After the enemy army repeatedly devoted its full strength to attacking Jiangwanzhen, suffering repeated heavy blows, it again changed its plan on the midnight of the day before. Yesterday morning, it concentrated 20,000 troops to fiercely attack our Miaohangzhen, 10,000 troops to attack the front of our Jiangwanzhen, and over 6,000 troops to attack our Baziqiao, exhausting all its strength to charge us. Our army calmly responded to the battle. After fierce fighting until 5:00 PM, most of the enemy, in the Jinmuzai area north of Jiangwan and east of Miaohangzhen, was completely surrounded by our army. The remaining enemy forces engaged in a full-scale retreat. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, killing countless enemies. Now, we will record the details of our army's fierce battles and killing of enemies in Jiangwan, Miaohangzhen, and other places yesterday.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Advance in Three Routes</h3>
<p>The enemy, after failing to attack Jiangwanzhen, changed its battle plan again. Around 3:00 yesterday morning, it advanced in three routes, fiercely attacking our Miaohangzhen. It is estimated that the first route involved a part of the forces from Jiangwan advancing northwest. The second route involved all the enemy troops stationed at Yunzaobang advancing west and south. The third route involved concentrating 20,000 troops from Zhanghuabang advancing north and south to attack our Miaohangzhen. The enemy's reserve troops also all went to the front line to fight, leaving only two or three hundred people to defend Yunzaobang and Zhanghuabang.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Bloody Battle at Miaohangzhen</h3>
<p>After the enemy army concentrated 20,000 troops in the Miaohangzhen area, it used over 30 armored cars and tanks, under intense artillery fire, to cover the charge, attempting to occupy it in one fell swoop. Therefore, the fierceness of its attack was unprecedented since the start of the war. Fortunately, our army's sentry detected it very early and immediately ran back to report, and the entire force prepared. When they approached, the troops in front fought back valiantly. At the same time, they protruded from the left and right to flank the enemy army's sides, encircling and attacking its rear. However, the enemy army had high hopes, so it also struggled desperately, putting up a desperate fight. The battle lasted until dawn yesterday. Short blades were used, and there was complete hand-to-hand combat. Afterwards, the enemy gradually became unsustainable and twice gathered rear troops to join the battle, recklessly attacking. The two sides engaged in mixed combat and hand-to-hand fighting. The intensity of the battle was even greater than the battle of Caojiaqiao. At the same time, several enemy planes also flew in the sky, frequently throwing bombs at our army's positions and assisting with machine guns. Our army, accustomed to it, was not moved. However, the enemy outnumbered us, and the strength gap was great. After 10:00, a dangerous situation appeared. Fortunately, the generals and soldiers had a determination to die, and each bravely resisted as if they were ten soldiers, until 12:00, when our reinforcements arrived in large numbers, and launched a surprise attack on the enemy army's rear, and then the situation turned from danger to safety. The enemy army was caught by surprise and suffered countless casualties, and the enemy's front line shook greatly. At this time, Japanese aircraft increased to more than ten, dropping bombs on our positions like rain. Our army, seeing that the enemy's strength had declined, changed from defense to attack,冲撞 and attacked from the left and right. By 5:00 PM, over 3,000 enemy troops had been killed, and the enemy completely collapsed. In this battle, our army won a great victory, destroying two enemy tanks, capturing one enemy armored car, over twenty field guns, and countless firearms.</p>
<p>Another report said that the enemy attacking the Miaohangzhen area yesterday morning was encircled by our army using a large encirclement strategy, and its communication was cut off. The enemy was well aware that it had fallen into an ambush. When it wanted to retreat, the return route was cut off, and it was difficult to escape. The small number of enemy troops covering the rear saw that the enemy in front had been completely besieged and could not provide support. They took advantage of the low pressure to release smoke bombs to cover their retreat, causing thousands of besieged enemy troops to be trapped in a bitter battle and annihilated. It is said that this battle was even worse than the previous day when the enemy secretly crossed Yunzaobang and was completely annihilated at Caojiaqiao.</p>
<h3>Enemy Army Suffered a Crushing Defeat Attacking Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the enemy concentrated its main force to fiercely attack Miaohangzhen, and at the same time, used more than 10,000 troops to attack the front of our Jiangwanzhen. Around 4:20 yesterday morning, more than 10,000 enemy troops, protruding from the eastern end of Chih Chee University, relying on the eastern embankment of the Xian Shi Football Field, launched a fierce attack on us, carrying 15 field guns and 5 horse-drawn mountain guns. At that time, our army was lying in ambush in the small ditch along the Songhu Road, silently firing not a single shot. The Japanese army then charged forward. When they were about to reach Songhu Road, our army suddenly rose up to meet the attack. At the same time, our troops stationed at the U.S. Community Temple also heard the alarm and launched an encirclement attack. The two sides fought fiercely. For a long time, another detachment of the enemy fiercely attacked us from near Xiaoguanyuan. Our army immediately turned into a skirmish line when they advanced. When they were near our trenches, they came out to meet the battle. After three hours of chaos, the enemy army stationed at the Liusan Garden heard the alarm and rushed out to rescue them, and our reinforcements were also transferred from Zhabei to participate in the battle. By 4:00 PM, the enemy had suffered over a thousand casualties and retreated in disarray.</p>
<h3>The Great Encirclement of Jinmuzai</h3>
<p>The broken troops retreating from Miaohangzhen and Jiangwan were pursued by our army, and were in a wretched state. At 8:00 in the evening, over 10,000 enemy troops in the Jinmuzai area, north of Jiangwanzhen and east of Miaohangzhen, were completely surrounded by our army. Although the enemy tried desperately to break through, they were ultimately unable to succeed. It is expected that the situation can be completely resolved this morning.</p>
<h3>Enemy Army's Full-Scale Retreat</h3>
<p>Most of the broken troops were heavily encircled by our army in Jinmuzai. The remaining troops had no fighting spirit. After our army's衝鋒attack, the defense line collapsed immediately. At 9:00 last night, the enemy engaged in a full-scale retreat along the Miaohangzhen, Jiangwan, and Baziqiao defense lines, retreating from Yinxiangxiang to Dixiwei Road and Pingliang Road, gathering at Wayside Wharf. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the vanguard units reached Yuezhou Road and Shenjiawan. For a time, the Hongkou area fell into great chaos due to the enemy army's disorderly general retreat. Our army, in order to respect the treaty, ordered that they must not cross the concession, otherwise the enemy taking refuge in the concession could have been completely resolved last night.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Zhabei Area</h3>
<p>Our Army's Artillery Fire Fierce; Enemy Army Collapses on All Routes; Major Fires Erupt on the Roads; Fierce battles also took place in the Zhabei area yesterday. From morning to night, it did not cease for a single day. The intensity of the artillery fire was the first of its kind in the war. The Japanese army devoted all its strength to attacking Zhabei, but they were all defeated by our army one after another, and they took advantage of the situation to pursue. At 3:00 PM, our army had completely advanced to Dixiwei Road, Yuezhou Road, Hongzhen, and Laobazi Road and North Sichuan Road. The Japanese army's front line immediately engaged in a full-scale retreat. At 8:00 in the evening, they were still collapsing along Wusong Road and Minhang Road towards the rear. At the same time, a major fire broke out suddenly at Zile'an Road, causing great chaos in the Japanese army's front line in Hongkou. At the time of the drafting, our army was still in pursuit. Our army's rear artillery team provided effective cover. Under the coercion of our artillery fire, the Japanese army lost its fighting ability and had already shifted to the Pujiang area to retreat. At the same time, the rear of the Japanese army's central route had been blocked by our army. There was no trace of the Japanese army at the Hongkou Target Field and the Japanese army headquarters at the bottom of North Sichuan Road. Now, we will record the news of our army's victories on all routes in the Zhabei area yesterday.</p>
<h3>Our Army Wins a Great Victory at Baziqiao</h3>
<p>At dawn yesterday morning, after the Japanese army launched a general offensive on Zhenjiangwanzhen, it divided its main forces to attack our Baziqiao, with more than 5,000 army troops using armored vehicles, mortars, and machine guns to charge in front. Our army immediately rose up to meet the attack, with hand grenades and machine guns firing at the same time, immediately killing dozens of enemy vanguards. Afterwards, the enemy army continued to charge fiercely, with soldiers falling forward and others following. However, because our army's artillery fire was fierce, they were not successful. Our army immediately launched a counter-offensive at this time, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The machine guns and mortars of both sides lost their effectiveness. The enemy advanced and retreated, and our army appeared and disappeared in the enemy's formation, unstoppable. Wherever our army went, enemy soldiers fell east and west, and blood splattered everywhere. Our army fought more and more bravely, and the enemy army no longer had the ability to resist, so they gradually collapsed towards the Hongkou Garden. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue. Along the way, fierce battles broke out again at the Target Field and Scota Road. However, the enemy's spirit had been weakened and they collapsed as soon as they resisted. At about 3:00 PM, our army had reached Dixiwei Road. Our rear troops also responded and advanced. At about 4:00 PM, our army's front line reached Yuezhou Road. At about 6:00 PM, they had moved towards Hongzhen. Then, the Japanese army's front line on that road was completely defeated by our army. At the same time, a fire broke out suddenly at Doule'an Road, and the order of the Japanese army in the Hongkou area was greatly disrupted, and they fled in a panic. At about 8:00 PM, the Japanese army retreated towards the Pujiang area along Wusong Road and Minhang Road. Our army was still in pursuit. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 2,000 casualties, and our army suffered more than a hundred casualties, who have been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Another Report of Annihilation of the Enemy at Qiujiang Road</h3>
<p>After attacking Baziqiao, the Japanese army continued to attack Qiujiang Road and Fusheng Road, with about a thousand troops. However, the streets here are vertical and horizontal, so it is difficult to deal with without a precise arrangement. Our army has the advantage in street fighting and defended properly, so the Japanese army was repeatedly defeated. When the Japanese army attacked, they attacked in two routes, one from Qiujiang Road and one from Xingjiazai Road. Our army had long had heavy troops in that area, and they also counterattacked in two routes. The two sides were fighting in the夾弄, with machine guns and mortars commanding a high position, making the enemy soldiers even more frightened. Therefore, before long, enemy soldiers had died by the hundreds. The rear troops were planning to retreat, and our army took the opportunity to rush in. Then, the enemy troops on both routes retreated to North Sichuan Road at the same time. Our army converged and pursued to the Qiujiang Road intersection, and then attacked Laobazi Road. The Japanese army was in this desperate situation and returned to resist stubbornly. Until about 1:00 PM, the enemy was completely annihilated. At about 3:00 PM, after learning that one route of our army had reached Dixiwei Road, they continued to advance towards the heart of Hongkou. At the same time, our rear artillery team used artillery to cover. At about 10:00 in the evening, the front line of this route of our army had reached Shenjiawan, approaching Wusong Road, and met with our army on Yuezhou Road.</p>
<h3>Interception at Tiantong'an Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday, our two routes of troops defeated the Japanese soldiers and pursued them to the Hongkou area. At that time, more than 500 Japanese soldiers attacking Tiantong'an Road were also defeated by our army and retreated to the headquarters at the bottom of North Sichuan Road. Our army then pressed forward and besieged the enemy headquarters. Until about 4:00 PM, the enemy army abandoned their positions and withdrew, but our army did not occupy them, and continued to pursue them on North Sichuan Road. As a result, the enemy army in the Hongkou area was surrounded and completely collapsed.</p>
<h3>The Wretched State of the Japanese Army's Collapse</h3>
<p>Last night, the Japanese army was pursued by our army from all sides, causing great chaos and a complete collapse. They scattered and fled in all directions to Wusong Road, Qipu Road, and Minhang Road, and discarded their weapons along the way, hoping to blend into the civilian houses. At one point, when a part of the Japanese army retreated to Qipu Road, the American soldiers stationed there, seeing that the situation was not good, quickly fired artillery to demonstrate, and the Japanese army scattered and fled, but they were annihilated by our army in the middle.</p>
<h3>The Great Fire on Doule'an Road</h3>
<p>At about 1:00 PM yesterday, the two armies were fighting fiercely. Artillery shells flew everywhere and filled the streets. The third floor of the Shanghai Sanatorium on Laobazi Road was hit by artillery shells. The back door of the Shenjiawan Fire Brigade and the front door of the west team members' dormitory were all hit by shells and broken. Also, after 9:00 last night, a fire broke out in the areas of North Sichuan Road Dade Lane, Doule'an Road, Dixiwei Road, and Fusheng Road.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation in Wusong Area</h3>
<p>One Japanese Warship Was Damaged by Our Army; Enemy's Two Attacks on Yunzaobang Unsuccessful; Yesterday morning, enemy warships and planes attacked our Wusong Fortress, but they were still unsuccessful, and one warship was damaged by our army. In the Yunzaobang area, around 1:00 yesterday morning, the enemy army attacked our position twice, but they were both repelled by our army, and the enemy army suffered heavy damage. At about 10:00 AM, an enemy armored vehicle advanced several times on the front of Yunzaobang, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. Now, we will record the details of the battle.</p>
<h3>One Enemy Warship Was Damaged</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, more than ten enemy warships used heavy artillery to attack the Wusong Fortress outside the port. At the same time, many planes assisted in the battle in the air. Our army also returned fire to resist. After about an hour of fierce fighting, one enemy warship was hit in a vital spot by our artillery shells. When the ship was damaged, it swayed from side to side, and there was a great tendency to sink. It was then protected and retreated by four enemy warships, and the remaining ships also sailed towards the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>The Dormitory of China Public School in Wusong Was Destroyed by Japanese Artillery Fire (Photo by Li Zunyong)</h3>
<p>The enemy planes, seeing the situation, flew towards Yangshupu. Another report said that the Changxing Company's Canadian Queen, which came to Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday, was anchored in Wusong, and had not entered the port. Passengers were picked up by small steamers sent by the company. According to the boatmen who returned to Shanghai after sending off the passengers, when the ship sailed into the Pujiang River, they saw eight Japanese warships. Starting at 2:00 PM, they sailed to Wusong again and concentrated their firepower to bombard our fortress. The artillery shells opened up in the air, like a bright light, and then exploded when they landed. However, after an hour and a half of indiscriminate firing, because the attack was ineffective, the Japanese ships hastily retreated after our army returned several shells, and anchored in the Shitousha sea area.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Two Attacks Failed</h3>
<p>The Japanese army stationed at Heiqiao and Zhoujiahamenkou in Songnan launched a fierce attack west at 1:00 yesterday morning, all the way to the Niguan Nunnery south of Jijiqiao, and was repelled by our army. When dawn was about to break, they launched a second attack. Our army was initially calm and did not fight. When they approached our army's defense line, an order was issued, and the Japanese army was encircled in the middle with a large encirclement force. Then the 大刀隊 went forward and砍killed two hundred Japanese soldiers, and the rest collapsed and retreated.</p>
<h3>Enemy Armored Vehicle Fires at Us</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the enemy army in the Zhanghuabang area opened artillery fire every ten minutes or so, bombarding our army's positions, and occasionally opening machine guns. However, it was purely a demonstration by the enemy army, with no target at all. Our army suffered no damage, so they did not return fire. At about 8:00 AM, three enemy planes flew to various positions of our army to侦察. They did not drop bombs, and soon went south. At about 10:00 AM, one No. 12 armored vehicle drove straight along the Military Industry Road from the Zhanghuabang Naval Hospital area to about 100 yards from the Yunzaobang New Bridge and fired machine guns. It was repelled by our army. Soon, the armored vehicle left and came back again, and was repelled by our army again. This happened four or five times. Moreover, a 京沪 Railway B-character damaged locomotive was actually repaired by the enemy army. Yesterday afternoon, at about 1:00, enemy soldiers drove it back and forth on the track between the Two Roads Factory and the Zhanghuabang Branch Road. At present, most of the enemy army in the Zhanghuabang area has been transferred to the Houjiamuqiao Miaohang area, so the number of people is less than two or three hundred. Almost no enemy soldiers can be seen near the Two Roads Factory.</p>
<h3>A Supplement to the Fierce Battle of Wusong</h3>
<p>The Japanese army in Wusong Zhanghuabang suddenly launched a fierce attack on Wusong with heavy forces from the sea, land, and air on the day before yesterday (20th) at dawn. Three冲锋 were unsuccessful and were repelled by our army. The details are recorded as follows. At dawn on that day, three Japanese warships suddenly appeared, one anchored at the Oil Point of Swine 南首南首 of the Fortress, one anchored at the Yunzaobang entrance, and one anchored at the Food and Rice Wharf. The three ships fired artillery and attacked Wusong. At the same time, the Japanese land army south of Yunzaobang used artillery to cover and launched a fierce attack on Song. Our army was calm and did not respond. When the enemy army was near, they opened rifle machine guns to sweep. At that time, more than ten Japanese planes, divided into several teams, each with three planes, used bombs and machine guns to bomb downwards. At that time, the sea, land, and air forces attacked fiercely, and our army bravely resisted, and then launched an unprecedented and great battle. The first fierce attack was fought until 10:00, and was finally repelled by our army. In the afternoon at 2:00, the artillery fire was reignited, and the Japanese air and land forces were concentrated in the Yunzaobang area to attack. At 4:00, the Japanese army, because of the heavy casualties, was still repelled by our army. That night at 8:00, the Japanese army tried to make a third attack, but still failed and retreated. Until 0:00 yesterday morning, the Japanese army actually sent 3,000 to 4,000 marines for a general attack, advancing from Yunzaobang to intercept Wusong. After our army resisted to the death and fought in the streets until 3:00, the Japanese army was more than half dead and wounded, and retreated in defeat. According to those who witnessed it, this battle was the most intense, and it was dangerous for the enemy army to rush in. Fortunately, our army was very brave, and the Japanese army was repelled. It was a great fortune.</p>
<h3>Enemy Plane Shot Down in Yanghang</h3>
<p>Near Dongliu, Gu's House in Yanghang, at about 2:00 in the afternoon the day before yesterday, a Japanese reconnaissance plane suddenly hovered in the sky over the township, reconnaissance the condition of our army. It was shot by the troops stationed there and fell to the ground. The fuselage was shattered. There was only one pilot in the plane, who was dying. A certain soldier opened two shots and ended his life. After dragging out the corpse, the pilot's body was unusually fat and white.</p>
<h3>Wusong Town's Marketplaces Were Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>When Japanese warships opened artillery fire to bombard Wusong on the 20th, the Yile Tea House on Waima Road was the first to be hit. After being hit by artillery fire, it immediately caught fire and spread. In addition, Japanese planes threw sulfur bombs, and the southeast wind was strong, so once it started, it could not be stopped. From Yile to the west, the fire spread to Huachang Rice Shop, Yongtaisheng Coal Shop, Gongji Bamboo Shop, Kerosene Shop, and Lumber Shop, all the way to the western end of the Oil Pier. The 裏街市路 burned from Tongsheng Candle Shop, a certain Jinghuo shop, noodle shop, Chunhe Restaurant,菜館, bean curd shop, Zhangjia noodle shop, sugar mill, Wu Zhengyou rice shop, and Gu Minghua 老虎灶, Xiaomazi, Xiaochaguan, to the intersection of San益 Road on Xi'an Road, burning for two days and two nights. The intensity of the fire was particularly rare, so that the western half of Waima Road and the area of Doushi Road were all reduced to ashes, and the tragedy was unprecedented and rare. This fire destroyed 90% of Wusong Town. I am afraid that less than 10% remains intact.</p>
<h3>Great Victory at Miaohang: A Triumphant Report</h3>
<p>Triumphant Telegram from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters.  The Songhu Garrison Headquarters triumphantly reports: Received ahead of schedule. Revered Inspectors of the Luoyang Executive Yuan, Nanjing Military and Political Affairs Department, and the Garrison Commander's Office; for the perusal of all Pacification Commissionerates, Provincial and Municipal Governments, Government Agencies, and Newspaper Offices: This morning, before 3:00 AM, the enemy launched a full-scale assault on our positions in the Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Miaohang areas.  Our troops counterattacked in a pincer movement, and after fierce fighting that continues to this moment, enemy casualties in front of our positions have exceeded 3,000. They are in complete disarray. Our troops are currently in pursuit. We respectfully submit this triumphant report.  Salutations from the Staff Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters,  印.</p>
<h3>War Bulletin of the 19th Route Army</h3>
<p>War Bulletin No. 22 from the Headquarters of the 19th Route Army (First Release). ㈠ The Japanese army has been distributing an extremely large quantity of non-combat propaganda materials in recent days, leading to unrest within their ranks and significantly impacting morale. ㈡ Yesterday (the 21st), the enemy launched a full-scale attack on our Jiangwan position.  Both sides engaged in fierce combat. Our troops fought valiantly, and the enemy ultimately failed to achieve their objective.  Foreign journalists reported that Jiangwan had fallen, which is absolutely untrue. The enemy's attacks in the evening were comparatively more subdued, while our artillery inflicted multiple hits on the enemy. ㈢ Yesterday (the 21st), eleven enemy warships and multiple aircraft attacked from the Wusongkou area. After a period of engagement, one enemy warship was critically hit by our artillery and retreated under the protection of four other enemy warships. The remaining six ships fled towards the Yangtze River. ㈣ Yesterday (the 21st), the Japanese army launched an all-day attack towards our Jiangwan position with tanks, artillery, and several thousand infantry. As a result, two enemy tanks were damaged and retreated. The enemy suffered over a thousand casualties. Unable to achieve their objective, the enemy turned to attack our troops in Miaohangzhen this morning (the 22nd). Both sides are currently in contact.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army's Exhausted Tactics: Aircraft Scatter Spurious Leaflets</h3>
<p>Denigrating the 19th Route Army. Attempting to Sow Discord. Yesterday, at 2:30 PM, three Japanese aircraft circled near the Municipal Government, scattering leaflets written in nonsensical Chinese, falsely using the name of the Central Party Headquarters to denigrate the 19th Route Army, claiming they were not under the control of the Central Government and had initiated hostilities against the Japanese army without authorization, attempting to sow discord. It is reported that similar leaflets have been discovered in numerous locations, including Zhabei and Zhenru.  We have obtained one of these leaflets, a specially made edition, as follows: [Text of leaflet] "The 19th Route Army, without the command of the Party and the Nation, independently initiated hostilities against the Japanese army, causing innocent civilians to suffer terribly. This is extremely unreasonable. Our party absolutely opposes initiating hostilities against the Japanese army. Down with the 19th Route Joint Army. Central Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang."  Upon viewing this, one should easily recognize it as a Japanese trick.</p>
<h3>War Situation Recorded by Western Newspapers</h3>
<p>Our Army Switches from Defense to Offense. The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that the 19th Route Army on the Jiangwan front, after three days of fierce fighting, suddenly switched from defense to offense this morning (the 22nd), assaulting the Japanese army positions east and north of Jiangwan. The Japanese army retreated in successive waves, and their artillery, fearing hitting their own troops, mostly did not fire. Thus, the two sides mostly engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The Chinese army bravely charged forward with hand grenades, bombs, rifles, and bayonets, only stopping when they reached the Jiangwan Racecourse. The Japanese 9th Division launched a large-scale attack on Jiangwan, and today is the third day, yet they still have not advanced beyond the positions they occupied on Saturday and Sunday. The 19th Route Army firmly defends Jiangwanzhen, and its resistance is extremely strong. Combined with their expertise in trench warfare, the Japanese army has had to continuously call for reinforcements to be sent to the front lines. Almost all army units along Yangshupu Road and other locations have been emptied out, and replaced with marines. The field artillery that the Japanese army placed on Boone Road on Saturday and Sunday has now been moved to the southeast corner of the Jiangwan Racecourse, and today at noon it fired non-stop. Four six-inch caliber cannons assisted from half a mile behind the front lines. Light artillery fire was also heard from the west and southwest of the racecourse. The artillerymen on the Chinese army side located the Japanese artillery positions and hit the area with several three-inch caliber shells. Currently, only two or three companies of Japanese infantry are stationed at the Jiangwan Racecourse; the rest are mostly members of the Japanese Red Cross. The sound of artillery was initially scarce this morning, but after noon, they resumed heavy bombardment of the Chinese army lines. According to Japanese officers, Ueda's headquarters, originally located at Fudan University, has now been moved to the Tianle Temple residence west of the racecourse. A Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reporter tried hard to find its location, but failed. From the viewing platform of the racecourse, two large fires were seen in villages northwest and west, and the sound of machine guns was very intense in both locations, proving that the Chinese army is still vigorously preventing the enemy's advance. Three Japanese tanks in the open space in front of the Jiangwan Race Club were joined by another tank at noon today. The tank bodies were riddled with bullet holes. In addition, an armored car drove out of Zhang Huabang and stopped at the intersection of Jiangwan Road and Xiangyin Road. The headlight on the front of the car was shattered by bullets.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Wusong Thin</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that the entire 24th Brigade of the Japanese army stationed in Zhang Huabang has been transferred to Jiangwan to fight, resulting in a thin Japanese garrison in Zhang Huabang. Including the sailors who landed this morning, there are only about two hundred men. In addition, the Japanese destroyer Yubari and six other ships have all left the area, so the Japanese army feels even more terrified, deeply concerned that the Chinese army north of the Yunzaobang River will cross the river and attack. Therefore, this morning (the 22nd), Japanese soldiers have been digging trenches at key points in the Tong Railway worksite, creating various defensive installations. The sound of gunfire is very loud west of the worksite, proving that the Chinese army is gradually approaching Zhang Huabang. Early this morning, Japanese warships bombarded the Wusong forts again for a moment. This time, they fired from the mouth of the Yangtze River, not from the Huangpu River as they did on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<h3>Chinese Infantry Advantage</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that yesterday (the 21st), according to a certain officer on the front lines, the reason the Chinese army did not want to hold the Jiangwan Racecourse was that the racecourse is a vast open space, easily targeted by Japanese artillery fire. Jiangwanzhen, with its many houses, is similar to Zhabei in situation, easy to defend and difficult to attack. As long as the rear communication line is not cut off, it is enough to repel the enemy's advance. Even if the rear communication line is cut off, the enemy can still be held off if the Japanese do not want to suffer significant casualties. Furthermore, according to a neutral observer, from 7:00 AM on the 20th to noon on the 21st, the Japanese artillery continuously bombarded Jiangwanzhen, but the effectiveness was extremely limited. Currently, the battle there must still rely on infantry to play a significant role, but the Chinese infantry is superior to the Japanese. The Japanese infantry, even with artillery cover, still dare not advance, which shows the training of the Chinese infantry.</p>
<h3>Ammunition Cannot Surpass Human Strength</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that foreign observers now believe that the Japanese army's continued artillery bombardment in its current position is a waste of ammunition and difficult to achieve any significant results. Although the Japanese army has aircraft to assist with heavy bombing, in the end, the battle will inevitably come down to close combat, which will rely on human strength to win.</p>
<h3>Imported Steamships Frightened</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that yesterday (the 21st), there was fierce artillery bombardment in Wusong from dawn onwards. According to the Japanese, the Chinese army attempted to cross the river to attack the Japanese army headquarters at the Zhang Huabang Railway Factory, but was ultimately repelled by Japanese destroyers and light artillery units. The battle continued for several hours. At 9:30 AM, when the artillery fire was at its fiercest, the Jardine Matheson steamship Kiangwo entered from the Yangtze River and sailed through the line of fire. A shell flew over and landed next to the ship, causing the river water to splash onto the deck. Several other shells flew overhead, almost hitting the cabins. Passengers and crew members scrambled to take cover. The ship quickly engaged full power and fortunately passed safely through the line of fire. Afterwards, two China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships, seeing the dangerous situation of the British ship, turned back outside the mouth of the river.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Assesses Our Army's Spirit</h3>
<p>Not Putting Japanese Soldiers in Their Sights Demonstrates Our Army's Great Fearless Spirit. Where is the Error? The Japanese Hochi Shimbun published a telegram from its Shanghai correspondent Ohtsuki on the 18th, stating: "Since the conflict on the night of January 28th, it has been extremely difficult to investigate the number of Chinese army casualties. However, the night attacks and counterattacks of the Chinese regular army, the agility and cunning of the plainclothes units, and the fierce resistance of the 19th Route Army are the opposite of what we (the Japanese) had predicted before the battle, namely, 'Chinese soldiers will flee after one battle.' Therefore, I have made a special study of the reasons for this. It turns out that the armies of Southern China do not understand the power of Japanese soldiers, and the officers who guide them despise our country's (Japan's) navy, even to the point of not putting Japanese soldiers in their sights. This is a kind of erroneous superiority of Chinese officers. However, the reason for this is due to the ten tenets of military education in China, which have created this. That is: 1. Do not fear death. 2. Do not be greedy for wealth. 3. Be able to endure hardship. 4. Love honor and know shame. 5. Strictly adhere to the Three Principles of the People and discipline. 6. Sacrifice personal opinions. 7. Love and protect the people. 8. Be loyal to duty. 9. Have a spirit of unity. 10. Eliminate communist parties who murder and commit arson, and overthrow imperialism. These ten tenets are recited daily by officers to the soldiers. Chinese soldiers are familiar with them and remember them well. Therefore, all soldiers are able to bravely advance and confront the enemy. Therefore, today we must not only not underestimate their army, but it is also very worthy for our army (the Japanese army) to take as reference."</p>
<h3>Japanese Say Our Army's Combat is Clever</h3>
<p>The Japanese Hochi Shimbun Extra Edition on the 17th publishes a United Press report stating: "On the night of the 15th, Second Lieutenant Sakai, commanding his officer sentries, departed from the far left wing of our Wusong line (Japanese army position) and thoroughly reconnoitered the enemy's position near Dongjiazhai. They carefully observed the intense firing of the enemy army (our army), which was truly astonishing. By the early morning of the 16th, the reconnaissance was completed, and the team returned to report that Private Shooya Yano (Japanese soldier) in Mantoushan had been struck in the chest and abdomen by bullets and was beyond saving." At that time, the reporter was also at the forefront, conducting a detailed reconnaissance. "I saw a powerful enemy battalion crossing the Wusong River, linking up with other units, and building strong fortifications centered on Yangjiazhai, about 2,000 meters west. They had installed one hundred machine guns on each line, and from the right flank to the artillery platform on the other side of the Wusong River in Dongjiazhai, they made a serpent-like formation. The enemy soldiers filled the positions, with high morale. I (the Japanese reporter) was filled with fear and my soul was shattered."</p>
<h3>American Soldier Praises Chinese Soldier's Bravery</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that on Sunday, an American soldier on guard next to Gate No. 8 of the North Railway Station recounted a Chinese soldier's bravery. According to him, on the morning of Saturday, the Japanese soldiers stationed near the Boundary Road attacked the Chinese soldiers' line on the Boundary Road. The barbed wire set up by the Chinese soldiers was damaged by artillery fire. A young soldier immediately jumped out of the line to repair it. When he was spotted by the Japanese soldiers, they immediately opened fire with machine guns. The soldier fell in response, but in a flash, a second soldier rushed out from behind a sandbag, crawling forward to drag back his comrade. However, the enemy's machine gun fire was too intense, and the clothes on his back were immediately riddled with bullets. Seeing the extremely dangerous situation, the soldier quickly ran into a nearby cigarette paper shop, which was located between the two armies' lines but out of reach of Japanese bullets. Although the soldier was slightly injured, he remained calm and composed, sitting on the balcony, watching the battle and playing the gramophone to entertain himself. He stayed there for over twenty hours, until late at night, when he took advantage of the opportunity to crawl back to his own camp.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Dropped Bombs Everywhere Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Pengpu and Zhabei Strike and Damage Japanese Aircraft, Destroying Civilian Homes and Injuring Many Villagers. After dawn yesterday, more than twenty Japanese aircraft flew to various locations in front of and behind our army to drop bombs, continuing until evening. The information obtained from investigations in various directions is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Zhabei</h3>
<p>After 8:00 AM yesterday, six Japanese aircraft flew to Zhabei, Baziqiao, Tiantong'an, Qiujiang Road, and other places to drop bombs to assist in the battle, and frequently opened fire with machine guns, attacking our army. Our army returned fire with anti-aircraft guns and machine guns, causing the aircraft to fly west. They soon returned to the Baziqiao area and dropped more than ten bombs, destroying more than ten civilian houses and injuring four poor residents of Jiangbei. Two aircraft flew very low and one was damaged by our army's rifle fire. After being injured, the aircraft barely managed to stay aloft before struggling to escape eastward. The others also flew away in succession.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that around 3:00 PM yesterday, the enemy's large bombs destroyed more than ten of our bungalows in Chaomibang, Zhabei, killing two women from Jiangbei on the spot. In addition, Wu Faxing, a Jiangbei resident, had both hands and one foot blown off, and half of the back of his head was blown off by shrapnel, killing him instantly in a gruesome and unbearable scene. At the same time, a bomb dropped by a violent Japanese aircraft on the Xia Family Alley on Gonghe Xin Road killed two men, whose names are unknown.</p>
<h3>Pengpu</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, three Japanese aircraft flew to Pengpu for about an hour before leaving without dropping any bombs. After 3:00 PM, more than ten Japanese aircraft returned to the town and dropped five bombs in villages such as Zhangjiazhai and Nianbatu, about two miles north, destroying seven or eight civilian houses and injuring more than ten villagers. They also opened fire with machine guns, strafing our civilians. For a time, the nearby residents all fled in succession. One Japanese aircraft had a portion of its right wing destroyed by our army's anti-aircraft fire and immediately fled east. All the other aircraft also flew away.</p>
<h3>Zhenru</h3>
<p>Enemy aircraft also flew to the Zhenru, Nanxiang, and Liuhe areas yesterday, around 1:00 PM. However, they all flew very high, their intention seemingly to spy on everything. When the enemy aircraft came to Zhenru, there were about three groups, each with three or two aircraft. They flew and sounded machine guns to show off their power, but our army had already taken precautions and responded with machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. Our air force also came out to engage the enemy. The Japanese aircraft were no match and fled in succession. Furthermore, those who went to inspect the Dachang war zone yesterday saw a Japanese aircraft shot down the day before still on the side of the road. The fuselage was extremely large. The bodies of the three pilots were all inside the aircraft. The one in front and the two in the back were wearing yellow hats and black military uniforms. There were also four undetonated 600-pound bombs.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Correspondent Injured</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that yesterday (the 21st), the Chinese and Japanese armies engaged in fierce fighting. Two Japanese newspaper correspondents, one a correspondent for the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, were inspecting the situation on the Jiangwan front line and were hit by stray bullets. Fortunately, their injuries were minor.</p>
<p>[Caption for photograph] Wusong civilian houses destroyed by Japanese aircraft bombs (photographed by Li Zunyong)</p>
<h3>Japanese Reinforcements Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Japanese Commander Ueda, due to repeated major defeats since the general offensive and the large number of deaths in the 9th Division, telegraphed Tokyo urgently, requesting that additional reinforcements be sent to Shanghai. The Ministry of the Army dispatched a certain division to Shanghai for assistance. The first batch was urgently loaded onto the transport ships Kasuga Maru and Nagayo Maru the day before yesterday afternoon, rushing to Shanghai overnight. They arrived here at 5:00 PM yesterday, with no more than four or five thousand men. The number of the division is unknown.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that according to reliable sources, two more Japanese army divisions will arrive in Shanghai from Japan this afternoon (the 22nd). It is said that one of these divisions will land in Pudong. It is reported that one of the two divisions arriving today is the Japanese 1st Army Division, recruited in Tokyo.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Uses Poisonous Gas</h3>
<p>The Enemy Again Cunningly Slanders. The China Press reports that after the Red Cross reported that the Japanese army used internationally prohibited dumdum bullets a few days ago, Japanese Consul-General Murai issued a statement denying it. The next day, Dr. Pym, a German doctor at the Red Cross Hospital with extensive experience in the European War, sent a letter to the hospital director detailing the discovery of dumdum bullet fragments in the wounds of Chinese soldiers. Subsequently, the Chinese representative also stated at the League of Nations Council the fact that the Japanese army used internationally prohibited items. However, yesterday (the 21st), Japanese Major General Shimada met with foreign reporters on the flagship Izumo and solemnly denied that the Japanese army used dumdum bullets, and even claimed that the Chinese army used dumdum bullets, and presented bullets as evidence. However, Shimada did not explain where these bullets were found, or whether any Japanese soldiers were hit by them. (Translator's note: The Japanese are so good at cunningly slandering that they can be said to be all-encompassing. Since the Japanese have this lie, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not spread lies and propaganda abroad again. Our country should also make some arguments.)</p>
<h3>Cen Chunxuan Donates 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Cen Chunxuan Donates 10,000 Yuan to Comfort the Officers and Soldiers of the 19th Route Army. Cen Chunxuan's urgent telegram reads: "For the perusal of all newspaper offices: My telegram to General Commander Jiang, Army Commander Cai, and all division and brigade commanders, as well as fellow countrymen, reads: 'The Japanese invaders are in Shanghai, but thanks to our 19th Route Army fighting with common hatred, we have greatly defeated the enemy's vanguard. The Great Wall is reliable, and we are fortunate to avoid annihilation.'"</p>
<p>"I, in my declining years, have retired to Suzhou, listening to triumphant reports every day, jumping for joy three hundred times. This battle relies entirely on our officers and soldiers fighting to the death to achieve victory. However, after days of intense fighting, their bravery is commendable, but their deaths and injuries are pitiful. I am willing to exhaust my meager strength and donate 10,000 yuan to comfort the dead and wounded officers and soldiers. I have served as an official for decades and have no savings, so I am using my retirement funds to make a small contribution. This small amount is intended as an initiation, and I hope that fellow countrymen will follow suit, enthusiastically contributing to support this effort. I also requested permission to go to the front lines to kill the enemy during the Sino-Eastern War, but regrettably, I did not achieve my goal. This year, I am over seventy years old and still willing to carry a feathered arrow and rush to the front to serve the country and die for it. However, my frail body is sick and my movements are difficult, so I am powerless, and I can only cry out in vain. I still hope that you all will continue your efforts, sweep away the evil atmosphere, wash away the shame of the Jiawu War, and promote the prestige of the nation. This will not only bring glory to Guangdong. The funds are deposited in the Shanghai Zhejiang Industrial Bank. Please send someone with a letter to collect them. I humbly submit this small contribution for your inspection. Cen Chunxuan."</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun's Letter to the People of Europe and America</h3>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that Mr. Gu Weijun, at the request of the Associated Press of America, has issued an English speech to the people of Europe and America, which has been telegraphed to newspapers in various countries by the agency yesterday. The translated text is as follows:</p>
<p>Gu Weijun said: "Now Japan has finally torn off its mask and is challenging the world. The ultimatum that Japan sent to our country is tantamount to a formal declaration to the world that it is waging a provocative war against China and intends to continue the war, regardless of the unanimous opposition of world opinion. This ill-fated hour arrived early in the morning of the 20th of this month. Just thirty minutes later, Japan's full array of war tools had already begun to move completely. Its army, navy, and air force, with 50,000 men, and its field guns, heavy artillery, tanks, machine gun teams, cruisers, destroyers, bomb-dropping aircraft, and other combat forces, simultaneously attacked us from both land and sea. This bloodshed that the world does not want to see is now underway, and the loss of life and property in our country will increase countless times. May I ask, what is the purpose of Japan's invasion? Is its purpose to protect Japanese residents? At no time has any significant danger been heard of for Japanese residents in Shanghai. However, under the pretext of protecting residents, the Japanese army, navy, and air force have killed thousands of our civilians and soldiers, and destroyed countless of our country's property. Moreover, since Japan provoked trouble in Shanghai, their own army has also suffered at least two thousand deaths. Is this kind of war not a war of aggression? We Chinese have long known the purpose of Japan's war. Japan wants to become the leader of Asia, and must first conquer China. This dream has been going on for many years. Japan has invaded and occupied the three northeastern provinces, an area as large as Germany and France combined. Because the countries of Europe and America have not shown any serious and effective opposition, and seeing that the countries of the world are already busy with their own internal and external problems, Japan is determined to carry out aggression against us in order to cultivate its power in Shanghai, the center of commerce and finance in the Far East, to occupy Wusong, the gateway to central China, and to occupy Wusong, which controls the passage to the Yangtze River, so that the rich markets of raw materials and sales of foreign goods in the Yangtze River basin will be in its control in the future. China, which loves peace and hates war, has exhausted its wisdom and energy to find a peaceful solution. Therefore, while China has appealed to the League of Nations and the signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty on non-war pacts, it has also accepted all proposals made by third-country governments or representatives to stop the war and resolve it peacefully. However, the effect is equal to zero. Japan, relying on its power, has turned a deaf ear to the resolutions of the League of Nations Executive Council, the advice and protests of friendly countries, the appeals of peace-loving public organizations, the advice of powerful newspapers in the world, and the fair efforts of great politicians, and has insisted on promoting its aggressive plan. Now, in disappointment, China is determined to resist to the end with force, regardless of any sacrifice. From our country's point of view, this resistance is related to the life and death of the nation. Although the result, whether victory or defeat, cannot be predicted, we must do our best to resist with force. Now, although there is no name for war, there is a reality of war. In the midst of this gunfire, thoughtful people have thought of countless serious questions. If China is subdued by Japan, who will follow China and suffer its aggression? Is there no way to stop Japan's rampant, nationwide, and frantic policy of conquest? Is the world's power to maintain peace insufficient to stop the rampant nature of this policy? If Japan's militarism can be allowed to run rampant without restraint, and peace-loving nations are trampled at will, then what will the future of the world be like? Can human beings in the world be allowed to degenerate and suffer the pain of another world war? Can the culture of the world be allowed to regress and be dominated by the principle that might makes right?"</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi's Reply to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Bai Chongxi in Nanning, asking him to quickly send troops to relieve the national crisis. Now we know that the Chamber received a reply from Bai yesterday, which reads: "To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Your telegram respectfully received. Your Chamber loves the country and cares for the people, expressing great strategies. I, Bai, am not clever, but I dare to agree wholeheartedly. I have already sent the 4th Army to depart first to resist Japan and suppress the Communists, only following the orders of the Central Government. My entire group is also waiting in readiness, resting on spears and waiting for orders. This is my reply. Bai Chongxi."</p>
<h3>A Letter from Wounded Company Commander Huang Dechang</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from Regiment Commander Zhang Junsong, along with a letter from Comrade Huang Dechang. After reading it, I was filled with respect. The text is as per the original. Respected Regiment Commander Junsong,</p>
<p>With utmost respect, I have been wounded since the 3rd of this month and, upon your order, went to the hospital for treatment. I was first taken to the Zhenru temporary hospital by our national medical team. After a few hours in Zhenru, an ambulance from the Chinese Red Cross Society arrived and transferred me to the Shanghai Haige Road Chinese Red Cross General Hospital for treatment. It has been two weeks since I was admitted to the hospital, and my wound is now healing. Fortunately, it wasn't a bone injury, so it's considered a minor wound. I feel ashamed for coming to the hospital to rest with such a minor injury. I haven't fulfilled my responsibilities and have truly let you down. I deeply hope to return to the battlefield to serve as soon as possible. My heart is uneasy because, in the face of national crisis, now is the time to take up arms and kill the enemy. Only by killing the Japanese invaders until they are completely defeated can we demonstrate the abilities of our soldiers. The officers and soldiers injured in this hospital all hope to recover quickly and return to the front lines to fight the unreasonable Japanese invaders with all their might, dedicating ourselves to the Party and the country. It would be glorious to die as Chinese ghosts rather than live as slaves of a conquered nation. Especially we soldiers should stand before the people as the vanguard. The above is my determination and the determination of the injured officers and soldiers in the hospital. I hereby report to you. Every day, people from all walks of life come to the hospital to offer comfort, especially the gentle words of comfort from the young ladies and children, which move us to tears. They ask us about the situation of fighting the enemy, and I briefly answer them, which makes them very happy. Here, I am far away from you, and I hope you are safe. I can't express everything I want to say. I respectfully wish you good health. One more thing, please forgive my lack of talent and knowledge if anything is omitted. Respectfully submitted by your subordinate, Huang Dechang, February 17th at the Red Cross General Hospital.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Maneuvers in the Philippine Islands; American Warships Observe the Situation</h3>
<p>Able to reach Shanghai within a week if necessary, according to the Mainland News. The United States has mobilized its entire naval and air forces, assembled in Honolulu, and conducted large-scale maneuvers for quite some time. According to the original plan, they were supposed to return to their original defenses three weeks ago. Now, due to the outbreak of war in Shanghai, they remain in Honolulu, observing the development of the situation. According to reports, the maneuver fleet consists of sixteen battleships, approximately forty destroyers, fifty other medium-sized warships, and four aircraft carriers. Calculating the voyage, the battleships and the fastest smaller vessels, if departing from Honolulu, could reach Shanghai within a week.</p>
<h3>U.S. Ambassador's Return to Beijing Delayed</h3>
<p>According to the Mainland News, U.S. Ambassador Johnson, after arriving in Shanghai, originally intended to return to Beijing by American warship last Wednesday or Thursday. However, upon hearing that the Japanese army declared they would formally demand the withdrawal of Chinese troops, he felt it more appropriate to remain in Shanghai temporarily, thus repeatedly delaying his departure. Yesterday (the 21st), according to a source at the U.S. Consulate General, Ambassador Johnson has indefinitely postponed his return to Beijing due to the extremely serious situation in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Collapse of Japanese Businesses After Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>There are many Japanese-owned factories in Shanghai. In addition to the large textile factories, there are also 54 medium-sized factories affiliated with the Industrial Comrades Association, with a total investment of 14,437,700 taels and an annual production of 29,515,000 taels. After the Shanghai Incident, thirty-three of them were closed. The other factories are mostly unable to operate due to financial difficulties, and the government has not provided any financial assistance, so they are inevitably forced to close.</p>
<h3>Japanese Citizens Plead for Cessation of Troop Dispatch</h3>
<p>According to a gentleman who returned from Japan yesterday, after Japanese Commander Ueda Kenkichi was sent to Shanghai, he observed the strong combat capabilities of our troops and believed that the forces in Shanghai were insufficient to win. He telegraphed the Tokyo Ministry of the Army, requesting an additional 100,000 reinforcements. After receiving Ueda Kenkichi's telegram, the Ministry of the Army approved the dispatch of a large army to China and declared that the Japanese army had achieved a great victory in Shanghai, but because of the attack on Nanjing, they could not increase their forces, etc., as a means of deceiving the public. However, the families of the soldiers and the public were well aware of the reality of the Japanese army's failure in Shanghai and believed that the government was intentionally deceiving the people. Therefore, before the dispatch of reinforcements, they gathered more than a thousand family members and went to the Ministry of the Army to petition for the cessation of troop dispatch. The petition was rejected by Minister of the Army Araki. The petitioning family members, unable to obtain their demands, gathered more than a thousand women and went to the train station, sitting and lying on the tracks to block their departure. However, the Ministry of the Army still insisted on its own way, disregarding the lives of the people, and ordered the train to start, resulting in the crushing death of more than a hundred women. Since this incident occurred, a major upheaval has arisen within Japan.</p>
<h3>Strict Prevention of Enemy Troops Purchasing Flags for Deception</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a public announcement to all merchants in the city yesterday, stating that recently, it has been reported that Japanese rogues, speaking broken Shanghai dialect, have been purchasing national flags and Red Cross flags from our country's stores, intending to impersonate Chinese citizens and arbitrarily create disturbances. Therefore, all stores are hereby notified to pay close attention. Hereafter, whenever encountering suspicious customers, it is imperative to strictly question them and verify their origins, and not to rashly sell to them, lest they fall into the enemy's trap. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3>The Two Railway Bureaus Provide Generous Compensation to Xu Bin, Deceased Nanchang Stationmaster</h3>
<p>Xu Bin, the Nanchang stationmaster of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, was killed by Japanese bombs while on duty at the station the day before yesterday. The Railway Bureau deeply regretted Xu's death in the line of duty and immediately provided generous compensation according to regulations, as well as support for his children. Xu was a local, aged 26, with healthy parents. Xu had just married the day before yesterday and had previously served as the Wusong stationmaster. After the incident, he was transferred to the Nanchang station and Fanwangdu station, but he did not go. The day before yesterday, Chief of Transportation Zheng Baozhao sent him to Nanchang to replace the stationmaster on duty, unexpectedly resulting in his tragic death. Police Chief Liu and two railway police officers, who were injured at the same time, were sent to the Suzhou Hospital for treatment the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Taxpayer's Association Again Requests Responsibility for the Neutral Zone</h3>
<p>And exemption of war zone police donations. The Shanghai Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association sent three letters to the Municipal Council yesterday, requesting that it stop the Japanese army from acting recklessly in the concession and exempt the police donation in the war zone as follows:</p>
<h3>Request to Assume Responsibility for the Neutral Zone</h3>
<p>To the respected Sirs, We received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that on the 19th of this month, they received a letter from Mr. Wang Zhaochang, stating, "The violent Japanese are unreasonable, gloating over our misfortune. After the floods in our country, they invaded the Northeast and are now attacking Shanghai, killing and setting fires, with cruelty and inhumanity unprecedented in Chinese and foreign history. Our army is defending our territory and resisting with all its strength to maintain humanitarianism, protect world peace, uphold justice, and defend treaties. We are not afraid of violence and are determined to kill the enemy, but we have always respected the police power of the concession and have not crossed the boundary by a single step. However, the Japanese soldiers disregard all countries, forcibly using the concession as a base of operations, and arbitrarily passing through various roads with arms, swaggering through the streets. They even fired shots to demonstrate in front of the Guanzheng Hat Shop on Nanjing Road, and threw bombs in the British and French concessions, injuring people and destroying neutrality, without any regard. It is like a mad dog biting people, regardless of their kind. If it is not stopped, then all human beings are in danger. The Shanghai concession is the most important place for trade for all countries. How can mad dogs be allowed to run rampant and cause danger? The Municipal Council has an obligation to protect Chinese and foreign residents and has a responsibility to maintain the dignity of the neutral zone. It should use special methods to strictly stop violence in order to prevent violence." Therefore, this letter requests your association to forward a letter to the authorities, lodge a protest, and make a serious request to the Municipal Council to uphold justice and urgently use strong methods to prevent Japanese troops from passing through the concession in order to uphold humanity and maintain neutrality. According to this, we have prepared a corresponding letter to convey this and hope that your association will investigate and handle it accordingly. Since the Japanese army's barbarity and its lack of discipline have already been proven by facts, they have recently expanded their barbarous behavior. Our country is not in their eyes, and they have even disregarded your bureau and all friendly nations concerned. If a solution is not urgently sought, humanitarianism and justice, not to mention neutrality, what are the direct and indirect interests of those concerned? According to the reasons stated in the previous letter, we hereby request your bureau to promptly discuss an effective solution with the countries concerned and the host country to stop the reckless behavior of the undisciplined Japanese army. Sincerely, To the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Request to Exempt Police Donations in the War Zone</h3>
<p>To the Respected Sirs, According to a letter from Yuan Fengrun Yuanji Tea House, "Since the Japanese opened hostilities, the losses of all Chinese people are countless. Those living under the jurisdiction of the municipal government, of course, need not be mentioned, but those in the concession, directly or indirectly, have also suffered untold losses, which is painful to speak of. Because our place is located at Dong Tangjia Lane, North Henan Road, although it is not important, during the extremely tense situation on the second and third days of this month, there was a precarious situation. Nearby residents moved away completely, and our shop had to move to a temporary office at No. 16, Renan Lane, Guling Road, British Concession, to handle the closing of last year's business. Other equipment and items are still stored at the original location in Xin Tangjia Lane, with people watching over them, planning to move back to the original location when the situation is slightly better. This is a last resort plan for merchants. What is difficult to understand is the police donation. The situation on North Henan Road is uncertain, and the Municipal Council has not sent anyone to collect donations, and each household has not yet decided whether to pay or not. However, Renan Lane is a newly built house that has just been completed. Several shops moved in only on the 16th of this month, and the Municipal Council suddenly came to investigate and collect donations, saying that if the original resident has already paid the donation, the new resident can be exempted, but if the original resident has not paid, the new resident must pay half the donation. However, in this chaotic situation, it is unclear what to do. Therefore, we have specially sent a letter to pay a visit, begging for guidance so that we may follow it, and we are extremely grateful." Upon arriving at the association, it was found that the issue of donations has become a major problem due to the barbarous disturbance of the undisciplined Japanese army. We now request that your bureau set a clear method. According to our association's opinion, the economic capacity of residents in all disaster-stricken areas has been completely lost and they must be provided with relief. Those who have fled from the disaster area to the south of Suzhou Creek should also be considered for their ability to pay. We also hope that you will reply to the various points of inquiry from Yuan Fengrun Yuanji Tea House so that we may pass them on. Sincerely, To the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Request to Expel the Violent Japanese Army</h3>
<p>To the Respected Sirs, According to a letter from the China National Products Maintenance Association, based on the proposal of Comrade Wang Jiean, Executive Committee Member of our association, "The cruel and inhuman Japanese army, taking advantage of our flood, has unjustifiably dispatched troops, occupied our three northeastern provinces, and recently attacked Shanghai without cause, arbitrarily using cruel means, indiscriminately throwing bombs, killing and setting fires, with countless dead and wounded, and displaced persons. The barbarity and cruelty have reached the extreme and are unprecedented in the world. Not only do they destroy world peace and violate the Non-War Pact, the League of Nations Charter, but also this kind of free action is truly a public enemy of mankind. Our China is fighting to maintain humanitarianism, protect world peace, and uphold treaties. We will not hesitate to make any sacrifice. There is no shortage of just people in the world, and the responsibility of who to shoulder is certain. As the US concession is a neutral zone, both China and Japan should respect it. However, all Japanese troops are landing at various wharves in the concession, destroying neutrality and infringing on the police power of the Municipal Council. The Japanese troops who have arrived know that they are specifically here to attack Shanghai and disrupt public order, but no one has stopped them, causing the Japanese army to do whatever they want, disregarding world law. It is unknown what the concession authorities think about this." Therefore, this letter requests your association to quickly forward it to our Shanghai Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association and various Chinese directors to seriously negotiate with the Municipal Council and find a way to stop it in order to maintain humanitarianism and protect the neutral zone. It is a matter of great public concern. According to this, it has been passed by the 21st Provisional Executive and Supervisory Committee of our association. We are sending you this letter in response, sincerely requesting your association and various Chinese directors to promptly put forward strict negotiations and find a way to stop it, and we are extremely grateful for your public concern. Upon checking, it was found that the undisciplined Japanese army has been able to cause chaos in Shanghai without any restraint, precisely because it has the convenience of the concession without being prevented. They land at the wharves within the boundary, according to the reason stated in the previous letter, and send a letter accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and immediately find a way to expel the undisciplined Japanese army in order to maintain neutrality.</p>
<h3>Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>The Municipal Maintenance Committee urgently needs donations. Since the outbreak of war in this city, various groups have organized dozens of shelters in the concession. Originally, this was intended as a temporary response to the emergency. Initially, it was not expected that the war would be prolonged, and the relief work could not be ended immediately. Daily supplies are very tight, and the various responsibilities are extremely heavy. The relief division of the Municipal Maintenance Committee is specifically established to provide refugees with food and clothing. As the number of shelters has increased daily, the matters of providing supplies have also increased proportionally. It is now heard that the supplies for refugees in five shelters are all undertaken by the committee, but the committee's finances are limited, and the supply side is increasing without decreasing, which is inevitable to be stretched thin. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide continuous financial assistance so that the relief work will not be interrupted. This is also an important task in the rear. It is noted that the division is dedicated to rescuing refugees in the war zone, and it is difficult to take care of unemployed workers in general, and it is not their job. It has been repeatedly stated. Today, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has requested the division to provide 600 dan of white rice to unemployed workers and has issued a letter stating that this is a temporary measure and will not be requested again in the future. It is heard that the division has approved the request.</p>
<h3>Daughters of Prominent Families Serve as Nurses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Committee previously appointed Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Xiaolin, and other nine people to represent the committee to慰勞 the wounded soldiers. The reporter recently met with Mr. Yang Xixian, a member of the committee's 慰勞 group, who was also one of the nine representatives. He talked about the rear rescue situation in this war and the brave and proactive behavior of our soldiers, which is enough to see the spirit of unity of the Chinese people against foreign aggression. Mr. Yang's words are recorded as follows: (The following is Mr. Yang's words) I was assigned to follow the representatives to various hospitals to 慰勞 the wounded soldiers and convey the committee's intention to 慰勞. The warriors were all more encouraged and deeply believed that defending the country and guarding the territory was the duty of soldiers. They were not afraid of death and did not care about injuries. They eagerly hoped to recover soon and return to the front line to serve. According to the hospital authorities, many soldiers were willing to leave the hospital immediately after being injured and return to the front line, but this was not allowed by the hospital rules, and they were firmly prevented from leaving. There were those who begged the doctors and nurses in the hospital all day long. It was heard that the director of the Hui Lu Hospital on Avenue Foch, Dr. A.W.Tucker, said that there were more than ten wounded soldiers in the hospital (the real names were given, but because they could not leave the hospital, they tried to borrow clothes from their fellow villagers, abandoned their military uniforms, and claimed to return to their hometown, requesting to leave the hospital. After leaving the hospital, they went to Zhen 如 and re-enlisted on the front line. The determination of soldiers to kill贼 and save the country is like this. It was also seen that the wounded soldiers received by the orthopedic hospital run by Mr. Niu were all taken care of by the daughters of prominent families. Because the 19th Route Army had many Cantonese soldiers, Mr. Guo Le, Guo Shun, and Feng Bingnan introduced Cantonese-speaking ladies to the various hospitals to serve as interpreters and attendants. This also shows the care in each hospital. After returning from the 慰勞, I had several thoughts. (1) The spirit of courage and sacrifice of our soldiers is truly unmatched. This time, the soldiers of the 19th Route Army had the determination to die, so they were able to repeatedly defeat the enemy's advance. (2) The rear rescue hospitals are able to abide by the charter of the International Red Cross and work conscientiously. One enemy junior officer was rescued in the general hospital. Regardless of whether he was an enemy or not, he was still treated as usual. (3) Our people, regardless of old or young, male or female, now have a consistent spirit against foreign aggression. From these points, it can be asserted that the military affairs against the Japanese army will eventually be victorious." (Note: Mr. Yang published an article in the Tianlong Monthly in November last year, "Respectfully Admonishing the People of the Country for the Survival of the Nation," extremely stating that our country should adopt a resistance doctrine against Japan, and only war can lead to survival, which has now been greatly verified.)</p>
<h3>World Red Swastika Society Rescue Team Work</h3>
<p>The World Red Swastika Society Rescue Team set off in two groups today. One group proceeded from Hengfeng Road, passing through the Sun Temple and Qiujiang Road. One group went to work at Dachang. The first group, when walking to Bazibao, encountered airplanes flying high in the sky and dropping bombs. Fortunately, no one was injured. Three wounded soldiers were rescued. They then went to Dachang, together with the members of the second and third groups, rescuing more than seventy injured soldiers and civilians. In the afternoon, while transporting the wounded soldiers, they encountered airplanes again, dropping heavy bombs one after another. Fortunately, the ambulance drove quickly, so they were able to avoid danger. It is heard that the first and second hospitals of the society are already full of patients. Personnel have been dispatched to look for houses and add a third hospital.</p>

Huang Jinyu, who was wounded in the shoulder, Yang Xuelin, who was wounded in the arm, Ding Chaoyun, who was wounded in the arm, and Gao Xuelin, who was wounded in the nose, were all sent to the 25th Hospital. Guo Qiyuan, the captain of the 7th branch, was in the midst of intense fighting at Dachang when he rescued a wounded soldier who had been injured by a Dum Dum bullet. The exit wound had blown a very large hole in his leg. Due to the severity of his injuries, he was unable to be treated and died. More than 50 wounded soldiers were rescued and sent to the Suzhou rear hospital. The team also rescued more than 30 bombed refugees at Dachang, four of whom died from their injuries. The rest were sent to various hospitals. A certain Chinese official in the British Concession Municipal Council, who did not wish to be named, stopped a Red Cross ambulance on Bailinan Road at 10 a.m. on the 22nd and donated 10 yuan to慰勞 the wounded soldiers. Zhao Erchang, the deputy captain of the 11th rescue team, received it. When asked his name, he only said that he was a Chinese official from the Municipal Council. Also, Ms. Wang Zifang, an injured rescuer from the Society, has recovered and been discharged from the hospital. Wang Dunfu's brain injury was very serious and he is still being treated in the hospital.</p>

<h3>Various Atrocities by the Japanese</h3>
<p>Shanghai North High School Destroyed by Fire Shanghai North High School, located at No. 572 Qiujiang Road, between North Sichuan Road and the railway, was in the line of fire. After the outbreak of war, it was occupied by the Japanese army. The director of the school affairs, Feng Henian, and the school worker, Yongkang, were detained at the headquarters for many days. They took the opportunity to escape, in a terrible state. Another school worker, Tingcai, hid in a small alley, peering through the holes, and witnessed the Japanese army going in and out busily. He saw them destroying books and instruments one after another. He was hungry, cold, and terrified for three days and nights. When the fire spread, he desperately crawled out, hid in a neighboring house, and wandered around, unable to escape. Fortunately, there was rice cake and other food left in the neighboring house, so he did not die. The day before yesterday, when our army rushed into Guangdong Street, he was forced by the artillery fire to escape. He was captured by our army and was able to survive. Only then did he know that the school had been completely burned down. The school's elementary school building at No. 630 Qiujiang Road was also occupied by the Japanese army at the time. They had guns and cannons on the roof. Also, the two iron doors of the school's dormitory and women's department at No. 498 Qiujiang Road were completely broken, and everything was looted. In summary, the losses were enormous.</p>
<p>Mao Quanta Factory Burned Down The Mao Quanta Wood Factory, located in the war zone, had long been evacuated by more than 800 workers and their families. Only a dozen people remained to guard the doors. On the afternoon of the 17th, seven Japanese soldiers, carrying military equipment, went to the factory to search. All the workers were inspected and monitored. They were forced to open the doors and lead the way. They then withdrew. On the 18th, another squad of Japanese soldiers, carrying machine guns, came for the same inspection. Around 5 p.m. on the 20th, the Japanese soldiers led a large number of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, totaling about 500 people. Half of them went straight to Wanguo Stadium. The rest broke into the door and installed cannons and military telephones. They then used strong force to threaten the workers to borrow cigarettes, tea, stoves, etc. About half an hour later, a telephone order came from the front, ordering them to quickly prepare and go to Wanguo Stadium. Not long after, eight Japanese soldiers returned, each carrying sulfur and other ignition materials. They ordered the workers to return to the factory to sleep. At the same time, they dispersed the ignition materials and set fire everywhere. In an instant, flames shot up into the sky, and the entire factory was burned to the ground. All the workers dragged the wall and escaped from the fire. The Japanese soldiers continued to open fire on the workers. The factory had been in Shanghai for more than 40 years. The loss this time was estimated to be 700,000 to 800,000,000 yuan. It is truly a pity that it was burned down by the violent Japanese. The factory is located at No. 567 Dongtiyu Club Road (behind Bazishan).</p>
<h3>Grain Price Stabilization Association Requests Protection for Hongkou Rice Shops</h3>
<p>Letter to the Public Works Bureau requesting the dispatch of instructions to the Police Department for handling.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Grain Price Stabilization Association sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau, stating: "We, the undersigned, hereby inform you that according to a letter from the Rice Merchants Association of this city, Fengyu Rice Shop at No. 2468-70 on East Seward Road, and Zhenxing Rice Shop at No. 2329-30 on East Yuhang Road, reported that at 4-5 PM today, Japanese ronin came to the shops on bicycles, claiming to want to buy dozens of shi of white rice regardless of the price. The shop assistants replied that they had little rice in stock and were instructed to maintain only retail sales to residents, and that they had no whole shi of rice to sell, politely refusing them. However, the Japanese left with resentment and were very violent, threatening to return and force the purchase. Now, the shopkeepers are uneasy and fearful of unexpected events, making it difficult to maintain business and provide food for the people. We believe that the violent Japanese often provoke incidents without reason and disturb our Chinese merchants and people. We are sending this special letter to report the situation, hoping that you will investigate and maintain order. We earnestly request that you consult with the relevant police station to provide special protection in order to maintain the people's food supply and ensure commercial stability. In view of this, since the Japanese military actions, rice and grain have been extremely scarce in the city. Today, the ronin went to Fengyu and other rice shops, attempting to purchase large quantities of rice by force regardless of the price. This is not only against common law but also threatens the tranquility of the concession. We hereby request your esteemed Bureau to investigate and promptly instruct the Police Department to exert every effort to protect the rice shops in the area. This is our sincere hope."</p>
<h3>Various Groups' National Salvation Association Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 2 PM, the Propaganda Group of the Shanghai Various Groups' National Salvation Joint Association hosted Chinese and foreign journalists at the Zhongshe. Mr. Hu Shuhua was elected as chairman and reported on the association's establishment purpose and process, stating that the association was created in response to the national crisis, with the aim of stopping internal strife, uniting against Japan, and persevering to the end. He urged the press to uphold just opinions and expressed hope for practical guidance and assistance from the association. Subsequently, Liu Shixiong and others from the Propaganda Group reported on the association's work outline. Later, a reporter from the Continental Evening News delivered a sincere reply. The meeting concluded with a pleasant banquet.</p>
<h3>Condolences from Public Works Bureau Chinese Staff and Long-Term Donations for National Salvation</h3>
<p>The members of the Chinese Staff Association of the Shanghai Public Works Bureau are extremely indignant at the unprovoked aggression of the brutal Japanese in Shanghai. Therefore, at the beginning of the incident, they initiated fundraising to provide relief for military needs. Recently, to facilitate long-term military efforts, they launched a long-term "5 Li Donation for National Salvation". It is reported that all members have voluntarily agreed without coercion, and some have even volunteered to donate more than 5 Li, demonstrating that the spirit of the people has not died and there is hope for national revival. The association's declaration for long-term donations for national salvation is recorded below, hoping that various foreign firms and institutions in the city will follow suit. The Japanese bandits have been disturbing Shanghai for nearly a month, and tragic events have been experienced by all. Although our loyal and brave national army has repeatedly thwarted the enemy's fierce attacks, the enemy has not succeeded. However, the flames of aggression are spreading, and the national crisis is urgent. Only with sustained resistance can we save the country from imminent danger, and only with the support of the people can we expect long-term military success. Therefore, various groups or individuals have been doing their utmost to seek permanent resistance. The strong are taking up arms to kill the enemy, and the weak are contributing money to aid the military, each fulfilling their responsibilities as a matter of course. At the beginning of the incident, the members of this association initiated fundraising, originally as a temporary expression of our meager efforts, rather than a long-term plan to alleviate the national crisis together. Now, as the bandit forces deepen and disaster is imminent, we must rely on self-salvation to resolve the crisis. Therefore, at the 17th executive committee meeting, we decided on a long-term resistance measure, that is, starting from this month, each member should donate at least 5 percent (the more the better) of their salary each month as military expenses. The period will last until the end of the Shanghai turmoil. This matter concerns national salvation and is intended to be carried out with determination. During this period, everyone should do their best, with no room for hesitation. We hope that all our members will attach importance to this personal interest, stimulate patriotic enthusiasm, and contribute generously, continuously, and jointly to achieve this goal, so that our brave soldiers at the front have the support and can permanently protect our territory. Shanghai citizens will be fortunate, and the whole country will be fortunate.</p>

<h3>Catholic Women Comfort Wounded Soldiers</h3>

<h3>Suggestion for Donating Water Pumps</h3>
<p>A letter from Mr. Gu Mingyuan states: "I, the undersigned, would like to express my admiration for the 19th Route Army's brave fight against the enemy, winning glory for the country. The people's condolences and assistance have been provided in every way possible. However, as spring approaches and heavy rains are expected, the terrain of Shanghai is low-lying, and the trenches will inevitably accumulate water. The soldiers are in the trenches all day long. How can they not suffer? If one or two water pumps could be installed at the ends of the trenches or in appropriate locations, the water could be pumped out at any time, reducing the soldiers' suffering and allowing them to focus on killing the enemy. I hope that all enthusiastic machinery factories and organizations will quickly donate some of these pumps."</p>

<h3>Relief Measures for Unemployed Youth by the Chinese Vocational Education Society</h3>
<p>Special Tutorial Courses for Universities and Middle Schools</p>
<p>Since the war in Shanghai, all schools have been suspended, and male and female students from this city and other places are at a loss and worried about being out of school.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>Having read in yesterday's newspaper about the many malpractices of the youth self-help national salvation fundraising groups, and the suggestion to ban them, we would like to clarify that our group was established out of admiration for the Nineteenth Route Army's heroic resistance against Japan and concern for the plight of refugees displaced by the war. We, with shared hatred for the enemy and the unified determination of the military and civilians to resist Japan, voluntarily initiated a fundraising team. The funds raised are used entirely for慰勞 and relief purposes, with absolutely no private misappropriation. We have receipts for all transactions and are ready for thorough investigation at any time. Moreover, this type of organization is purely an義務性 effort by the people in the rear to save the country. We dare to say we are blameless, and we swear by the heavens and the sun. We fear that outsiders may not understand the truth, leading to misunderstandings. Believing that all patriots share the same sympathy, we dare to request that your newspaper publish this letter and correct the record.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Shanghai Youth Self-Help National Salvation Corps</p>

<p>Through the mediation of diplomatic representatives of neutral countries, both China and Japan agreed to convene a meeting of military commanders to discuss the matter on the basis of the withdrawal of troops by both sides.</p>
<p>This meeting was held on the morning of February 18th. Chiefs of Staff representing the commanders of both China and Japan attended. The Japanese representative presented conditions that the Chinese representative deemed unacceptable. The discussion lasted for two hours without result. The Japanese representative stated that the Japanese conditions would be notified in writing by 9:00 PM, and expressed hope that China would reply promptly. The discussion thus broke down.</p>
<p>Around 9:00 PM, the Japanese sent the proposed conditions separately to the Mayor of Shanghai and the Commander of the Nineteenth Route Army. The wording of these conditions differed slightly, but their content was as follows:</p>
<p>1. Chinese troops shall cease hostile actions and completely withdraw from the first line of defense by 7:00 AM on February 20th, and completely withdraw from the second line of defense to a point 20 kilometers north (20 kilometers including the Zizhu Lin Fort) by 5:00 PM on the same day, i.e., from the northern end of the Public Concession and the Suzhou Creek to the Puzong Town, and from the eastern bank of the Huangpu River at Lan Nidu to Zhangjiaqiao (i.e., the line extending eastward from the Suzhou Creek). All forts and military facilities within the evacuated area must be removed and not re-established.</p>
<p>2. Japanese troops will not attack or pursue Chinese troops, but may send aircraft for reconnaissance. After the withdrawal of Chinese troops, Japanese troops will only maintain the area near Hongkou where the Municipal Council has built roads, including Hongkou Park.</p>
<p>3. After the Chinese troops withdraw from the first line of defense, the Japanese army may send investigators, accompanied by guards and flags, to the evacuated area.</p>
<p>4. China shall be responsible for ensuring the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents outside the evacuated area. If necessary, Japan will take necessary measures itself. All plainclothes teams must be thoroughly disbanded.</p>
<p>5. The issue of protecting foreigners in and around Shanghai and the evacuated area will be discussed later.</p>
<p>6. Regarding the anti-Japanese movement, the points promised by the Mayor of Shanghai on January 18th should be strictly implemented. This matter will be handled through diplomatic negotiations between the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chinese administrative officials in Shanghai.</p>
<p>If the above conditions are not accepted, the Japanese army will have no choice but to act freely.</p>
<p>The following day, February 19th, the Chinese side replied, one copy sent by the Mayor of Shanghai to the Japanese Consul-General, and another by the Commander of the Chinese troops to the Commander of the Japanese troops. In his reply, the Mayor of Shanghai stated that the current serious situation in Shanghai was entirely due to the Japanese army violating all treaties and international law, invading Chinese territory, and massacring Chinese people. The Japanese Consul-General's demands are directly related to Sino-Japanese relations and should be handled by the diplomatic authorities of the two countries. The Japanese Consul-General's letter has been forwarded to the Chinese government for consideration and will be responded to by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Japanese Minister. The Mayor of Shanghai also stated that the Japanese army's provocative actions continue unabated, causing the Chinese people's hearts to grow increasingly indignant. The so-called anti-Japanese movement has failed to stop, which is a natural consequence.</p>
<p>The Commander of the Chinese troops replied that his troops are part of the national army and are under the command of the National Government. Therefore, the letter from the Commander of the Japanese troops has been forwarded to the National Government.</p>
<p>As for how the Chinese government responded, it is currently unknown (and it is not known whether there was any response).</p>
<p>On the night of February 19th to 20th, the Japanese army reinforced troops to the front lines from its base in the Public Concession and sent aircraft for reconnaissance. Knowing that the Chinese troops had not withdrawn from the defensive lines according to Japanese demands, they began attacking Jiangwan and Wusong at 7:00 AM on February 20th, continuing throughout the day.

<h3>The Future of the League of Nations Special Assembly</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Now that the League of Nations Administrative Council has exhausted its efforts to reconcile the Sino-Japanese dispute, there are various speculations about the possibility of convening a special meeting of the League of Nations Assembly. It is generally believed that the League of Nations Assembly, which will meet on March 3rd, will do nothing different from the Administrative Council except to decide to apply Article 16 of the Charter to impose economic sanctions on the aggressor.

<h3>The British Advocate That the Powers Jointly Restrain Japan</h3>
<p>London Today, Londoners are criticizing news from the Far East, now feeling that China is united in resisting Japanese atrocities. Some predict a final solution will be initiated by Britain, while others advocate that the powers, together with the United States, take immediate action to restrain Japan. All sides are now eager to study the latest communiqués. Prime Minister MacDonald is at his villa, but Lord President of the Council Baldwin is at the Prime Minister's residence, and personnel from the Foreign, Naval, and War Departments are all on duty. This morning, some relatives of merchants and soldiers in Shanghai gathered outside government offices, hoping to find out if there was any news of danger to the British in Shanghai. There have been many rumors about supplying military equipment to the Far East recently, but they have not been confirmed. The Reynolds News states that France has now received a large order for military equipment from Japan. As for the claim that Britain is currently supplying China and Japan with a large amount of ammunition, it has been refuted. Trade statistics for British ammunition exports to all parts of the world in January show that this January has decreased by 50% compared to the same month last year. (Reuters telegram dated 21st)</p>
<h3>US Political Circles Remain Silent on the Shanghai Situation</h3>
<p>(Washington) Although US political circles regard the Sino-Japanese dispute in Shanghai as extremely serious, they remain silent and unwilling to express any opinion. US personnel stationed in Shanghai are continuously sending reports of the local war situation to the State Department every day, and Secretary of State Stimson attaches great importance to these detailed reports, personally reviewing them one by one. The news that Japan continues to send reinforcements to support Japanese Commander Ueda in Shanghai has shocked all sectors, but the State Department seems unwilling to take further diplomatic action. (National News Agency telegram dated 21st)</p>
<h3>British Nationals in Shanghai Will Be Evacuated if Necessary</h3>
<p>British Secretary of State for War Makes a Statement</p>
<p>London Although the government still feels the situation in Shanghai is tense, it does not feel panic. There has been considerable activity on Downing Street at the end of this week. Secretary of State for War Hailsham and Foreign Secretary Simon are in close contact regarding the development of events. The Secretary of State for War stated that if necessary, British nationals can withdraw from the Public Concession. All arrangements have been completed, but there is currently no cause for panic. British Prime Minister MacDonald returned from his villa to his residence this afternoon. Shortly after, Baldwin went to meet with him for a long time. The Prime Minister will stay in London temporarily to handle official business and will return to his villa for rest on Wednesday. Doctors have forbidden him from attending the House of Commons.

<h3>Plan for Economic Alliance of European Countries</h3>
<p>Yugoslavia Submits to the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Yugoslavia submitted a practical plan for a European economic alliance to the League of Nations, stating that a certain degree of cooperation among the people of Europe, leading to the establishment of a single European market, is the best tool for promoting friendship among European nations. To create a single European market, there are five main points: (1) Customs Union. This matter largely depends on the major powers. (2) European countries give each other preferential tax rates, while imposing high import taxes on countries outside Europe. (3) Financial mutual assistance. European countries provide each other with low-interest loans for agricultural, industrial, and commercial purposes. (4) Economic organizations or European international industry alliances should enter into contracts to control production. (5) Organize an international committee similar to the recently formed German-French Committee, with the aim of establishing effective commercial and economic relations between countries. According to this plan, it will be submitted to the European Federal Council for consideration. (National News Agency telegram dated 21st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Official Circles State the Purpose of the Military Operations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Official circles here say that the purpose of the Japanese military operations in Shanghai is to drive the 19th Route Army along the 20-kilometer line. It is expected to take a week or ten days to reach this goal. Then the Japanese army will adopt a defensive posture along the occupied line. After the tense atmosphere has fully eased, or after a temporary neutral zone has been agreed upon, the Japanese army will withdraw. The authorities here seem to think that unless there is an unexpected development, there is no need to send more reinforcements. (Reuters telegram dated 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the Asahi Shimbun published excerpts from a conversation with Rear Admiral Suetgugu, who recently returned from Shanghai, saying that the Japanese army in Shanghai adopted an offensive posture in the hope that the Chinese army would withdraw voluntarily. Unexpectedly, this caused the Chinese army to fortify its positions, increasing the difficulty for the attackers. The scope of the war will likely be far beyond expectations. Without a large increase in reinforcements, taking an offensive posture would be reckless, as the Chinese army is increasing reinforcements daily and its defenses are becoming increasingly consolidated. Grand Chamberlain Count Makino visited Elder Prince Saionji in Okitsu today, proving that the authorities are extremely concerned about the Shanghai situation, and the disagreement over the issue of sending reinforcements is also clearly visible.

<h3>The New French Cabinet Considers the Cabinet's Policy Declaration</h3>
<p>(Paris) The new French cabinet met this morning to consider the cabinet's policy declaration, which Prime Minister Tardieu will read in the National Assembly tomorrow. The cabinet has approved the draft submitted by the Prime Minister and can be decided at tomorrow's meeting. It is said that the text is quite short and focuses on foreign policy, budget matters, and unemployment. Tardieu expects to receive the approval of the majority of the National Assembly. According to Tardieu, once the National Assembly approves, he will go to Geneva to direct the delegation participating in the disarmament conference. (National News Agency telegram dated 22nd)</p>
<h3>French Political Groups Begin Election Campaigns</h3>
<p>(Paris) Seventeen French political groups have now begun campaigning for the general election. The French general election will be held in May of this year, and the organization of the French National Assembly for the next four years will be determined by this election. The number of candidates this year is estimated to be over 3,500, and the Nationalist Party, with sufficient election funds this year, has begun a large-scale competition, using the disarmament issue as its banner. Propaganda from this party can be seen throughout the country, from large cities to the smallest villages, arguing that France should not reduce a single gun or disband a single soldier.

<h3>Japan's Reply to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Blatantly Disregards the League of Nations Charter</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's reply to the League of Nations Administrative Council's request for information will be sent to Geneva this afternoon. It will be published by the Japanese embassies in various overseas countries. It is said that the text clearly states that China's turmoil and civil war occur from time to time and cannot be regarded as an organized country, so the League of Nations Charter does not apply to China. (Reuters telegram dated 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The issuance of Japan's reply to the League of Nations' request for information has been postponed. It is expected that the document will be submitted to the cabinet and can be issued tomorrow. (Reuters telegram dated 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Bombardment of Shanghai Destroys the League of Nations Structure</h3>
<p>London The Daily Express's Geneva dispatch states that the bombardment of Shanghai has destroyed the structure of the League of Nations in Geneva. Based on this statement, the Express wrote an editorial, saying that the League of Nations has failed and it is now urgent to implement Article 16 of the Charter. The Daily Telegraph states that the US Chinese troops' resolute spirit, but states that Japan has a military advantage and can win. The newspaper still argues that Britain should adhere to a policy of non-intervention when maintaining the safety and interests of its citizens, and that the countries with treaty status in China have decided that no matter how the local situation develops, there is no need for foreigners to leave the country.

<h3>Britain Does Not Want to Get Involved in the Vortex of War</h3>
<p>Foreign Secretary Simon Responds to Labor Party Questions</p>
<p>Our Soldiers' Valor Astonishes the British</p>
<p>London At today's meeting of the House of Commons, Labor MP Cocks asked the Foreign Secretary: Manchuria is now organizing an independent country, which violates the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations Charter. What steps will the government take to deal with this? Sir John Simon replied that the Japanese government is less likely to recognize this new country than any other government. Your question is based on speculation, and the information I have received has not confirmed it. Cocks also asked whether the government had consulted with the United States and other member states of the League of Nations in order to put diplomatic and economic pressure on Japan to respect the sanctity of international obligations. Simon's response repeated the same words as his previous reply to similar suggestions, saying that the Sino-Japanese dispute is currently being handled by the League of Nations Administrative Council, and the British government is still acting in concert with the League of Nations and the United States. Simon also said that despite various efforts to eliminate the scourge of war, a major war has broken out in Shanghai, which he deeply regrets. British women and children in Shanghai will not need to leave the country, but the authorities have made detailed preparations for this. Simon concluded by saying that British Ambassador Lampson has, together with the representatives of France, Italy, and the United States, lodged a protest with the Chinese and Japanese authorities against any actions that may endanger the lives and property of foreigners. (Reuters telegram dated 22nd)</p>
<p>London The combativeness of Chinese soldiers has always been underestimated. Now it is so tenacious and unyielding, which is unexpected. Everyone is amazed and full of praise. The fact that the Japanese army is now encountering very strong resistance is becoming increasingly apparent. It is hoped that this may cause the Japanese to make moderate demands and reach an agreement with China. British people familiar with the overall situation in the Far East are now paying attention to Japan's national currency being consumed by large-scale warfare. Many believe that if the Chinese army can resist for a few more days, Tokyo will adopt a "second thought." Although Britain is moved by the tragic situation of the war, according to the opinions of the most powerful organizations, Britain is determined not to be involved in the vortex of war. Currently, all parties are campaigning against the implementation of Article 16 of the League of Nations Charter, so as to avoid economic sanctions against Japan. Many newspapers carry editorials saying that Britain is just emerging from financial turmoil and should try its best to avoid large-scale naval and army wars, as this will not only destroy British commerce in the Far East but also cost hundreds of trillions of pounds. However, liberal party newspapers still urge that sanctions be imposed on Japan regardless of the consequences. The Manchester Guardian scathingly criticizes the League of Nations politicians for being "too timid to dare to try sanctions, turning to self-entrapment." Their indecision has made it impossible to gather the world's public opinion to resist Japan, and</p>

<h3>Telegram from Luoyang</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices, please note: We have read Commander-in-Chief Chiang's telegraphic instructions with respect. The Japanese rely on their violence to destroy all conventions and organizations that maintain world peace, betraying faith and righteousness, wielding their claws and teeth, and bullying a superior nation. They are criminals against the world and enemies that our country cannot coexist with. Our soldiers of the 19th Route Army are clearing away obstacles to civilization for the world and acting as the Great Wall for the nation, acting righteously and bravely, facing difficulties without shirking, killing the enemy with decisiveness, and full of righteous spirit. Reading the circular telegram, the spirit of loyalty and righteousness overflows from the words, enough to illuminate the sun and moon and move ghosts and gods, to promote the glory of the nation and especially chill the courage of the enemy. The survival of the nation and communists, people in life and death, the situation is already difficult. So, there is only the sinking of the ships and a national, united heart to go to it. Li Liejun, Ma Yin,</p>
<h3>Telegram from Hangzhou</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices, please note: Having read Minister He's telegram, I feel indescribable admiration. The affliction of our country today, compared to the visible powerful enemy pressing the border, is even more serious, a hundredfold more, nothing surpasses the weakening of the inherent Eastern culture and the loss of the national spirit. Pursuing profit and forgetting righteousness, abandoning oneself and seeking from others, the beginnings of expelling outsiders are increasing daily, the defenses of the fences have been decided early, integrity and propriety are lost, how is this happening? A country on this earth, must have a position to stand. If the four cardinal principles are not upheld, it will lead to ruin. The late Premier's foresight, deeply understanding the conclusion, bequeathing instructions, showing early and circulating widely, one must promote the essence of our country's inherent culture, and then can sow the gospel of all mankind. One must promote the virtues of mutual love and sincerity of our nation, and then can curb the collapse of the flow of power. At this time when the national crisis is most urgent, the knife and cutting board are next to us. It is important to quickly arise and directly pursue, jointly seeking salvation. It is especially important to start from oneself, without catching the disease of reaching for the sky and aiming high, without treading on the discussion of abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the trivial. If one does not shrink from self-reflection, what enemy is to be feared? It is hoped that the entire country will unite and advocate, striving to advocate the way, saving the heart of the people from ruin and turning the fate of the country at the beginning. Respectfully presenting my foolish thoughts, earnestly requesting consideration. Lu Dipin bows and raises his hands.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Important Daily Records Regarding the Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>The Daily Knows That Toughness Is Useless. The Japanese Tokyo Jiji Shinpo [Current Affairs Newspaper] Current Affairs Commentary says, "The actual situation in Shanghai is deliberately reported falsely, confusing black and white, which is truly regrettable. Currently, Japan is only using tough warnings to China, but the Chinese side is becoming increasingly indifferent, which is deeply worrying. In addition, the League of Nations has also acted rashly, misunderstanding Japan, which is even more regrettable."</p>
<p>Attitude of Small Country Representatives in the League of Nations. The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun [Daily Newspaper] says, "Representatives from Norway, Spain, and South American countries all say that Japan disregards the repeated recommendations of the League Council and attacks Shanghai, striving to invoke the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and other relevant treaties, which is quite strong. Therefore, Chairman Paul Hymans has been criticized by various small countries and is quite hesitant about applying Article 15. Later, four members, the representatives from Spain, Yugoslavia, and France, drafted a resolution stating that Japan's attitude is considered to be in violation of the spirit of the League's charter, and to avoid the suspension of military actions, a severe ultimatum should be issued to Japan alone. The opinions of all parties are consistent, and the resolution will be implemented. It is heard that in addition to the original committee, a new committee will also be organized at the upcoming League General Assembly. All countries that have signed the Nine-Power Treaty and countries that have relations with the Pacific will all participate."</p>
<p>Yoshizawa Smooths Relations with Foreign Envoys in Tokyo. The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun says, "In order to promote a peaceful resolution to the Shanghai Incident, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa invited the envoys from Britain, the United States, and France to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:00 PM on the 15th to smooth things over. The British, American, and French consuls-general in Shanghai were rebuked for protesting Shigemitsu's landing of Japanese troops in the Public Concession and completely defended China. It was also said that the decision of the Twelve-Nation Conference should have mentioned China along with Japan, recognizing that each country's views were greatly mistaken."</p>
<h3>Japanese Communists Active</h3>
<p>Students Vigorously Promote Communism. Although Japan has been wantonly invading other countries, its domestic situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, and society is in extraordinary turmoil. According to Japanese newspapers, the activities of the Communist Party are as follows: 1. On the 14th of this month, hundreds of letters with radical words were found in the Waseda University post office. They were issued by the Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Communist Party. The content described fraud in the general election struggle. The letters were distributed to workers in and outside Tokyo to urge them to rise up in revolt. 2. Sixteen students from Taisho University in Ikebukuro, Sugamo, outside the city, launched an anti-religious movement in the name of a left-wing organization, causing a major shock in the religious world. They are in contact with the Communist Youth League and are running wildly among students across the country, carrying out a mass communist movement. 3. Araki of Gokiso-cho, Nagoya, etc., are also vigorously promoting communism. When testifying at the Nagoya High Court on the 6th of this month, they recounted the connections of the Japanese Communist Party. It is heard that the knowledge, labor, and military circles throughout Japan are gradually being infected by communist activities.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhijiang Arrives in Nantong and Transfers to Haizhou</h3>
<p>Investigating Coastal and River Defenses. A correspondent from Nantong reports that Zhang Zhijiang, the Jiangsu Pacification Supervisor, came to Nantong from Yangzhou on the 19th to inspect coastal and river defenses. He also convened the heads of military, police, and political agencies to deliver speeches, giving instructions on the key points of defense for each port. When Zhang arrived in Nantong, local circles held a welcome meeting at the Chamber of Commerce, chaired by Magistrate Zhang. Zhang Zhijiang gave a speech on national crisis and self-defense, stating that he had come to inspect the Jiangfang of Nantong because it was important, even though the garrison troops had made repeated reports. Today, he had taken the opportunity to talk about national crisis and self-defense. Since the incident in Dong Province suddenly arose, everyone knew that it was a matter of life and death for the entire country, and there were various reasons for resistance and non-resistance. However, the recent extraordinary national crisis, as a legitimate defense of self-defense, should not be measured by the normal circumstances of victory or defeat. With Ma Zhanshan's resistance, the Japanese invasion of Heilongjiang could no longer be like taking something out of a pocket. If the land is taken, there must be a considerable price. The 19th Route Army fought hard in Shanghai for more than ten days, dealing a major blow to the Japanese. All those with a little enthusiasm are protecting Ma Zhanshan and the 19th Route Army, which is enough to prove that the heart of the people has not died. Therefore, non-resistance is not even qualified to be a slave to the nation. The will of the people is like this. We must be in the position of the people, responding to the current national crisis, only with the total mobilization of the whole people, the total sacrifice, and cannot survive without struggle. In the future, I hope that the leaders and compatriots throughout the country will unite sincerely and no longer superficially agree and actually disagree. On the 21st, Zhang left Tong for Xuyi and Pukou, and then to Haizhou.</p>
<h3>Wen Chengkang Announcement</h3>
<p>The office has now moved to Kangji Company, No. 1, 3rd Floor, Wuma Road. Please come to negotiate any public or private matters. Telephone No. 13404.</p>
<h3>Transfer Statement</h3>
<p>Fuchangzhuang, located at No. 231 Sichuan Road A, due to shareholders' unwillingness to do business, is willing to transfer all business assets, store foundation, all renovations and signboards, etc., to Fuchang Wenjizhuang, adding business registration. The transfer price has been clearly paid in full. After the transfer, the business of Fuchang Wenjizhuang is unrelated to Fuchangzhuang. All debts owed by Fuchangzhuang's personnel are still the responsibility of Fuchangzhuang and are not related to Fuchang Wenjizhuang. In addition to drawing up a contract, it is feared that it may not be fully known, so this announcement is made in Shenbao and Xinwen newspapers. Transferor: Fuchang. Transferee: Fuchang Wenji. January 21st, Year 21 of the Republic of China. Geng D323.</p>
