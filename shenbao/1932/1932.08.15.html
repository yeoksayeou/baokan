<h3 id="c1">勉本屆出洋學生　翰 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>時屆夏令。每有大批靑年。出洋留學今雖當國難嚴重百業凋疲之際出洋之學生。仍非常踴躍。此豈我中華獨多壯志遠遊之士乎。蓋爲求學計。不得不如是也。</p>
<p>夫在文化程度最高之國家。其靑年之出洋留學者亦最少。以本國之敎育旣臻完美。固不必再求諸他國。至多亦不過在學業告成後。往外一遊。作考察奥研究之資而已。反之文化程度低落之國家。其靑年之出洋留學者必多。以自國之敎育。旣不夠應付今日新時代之用。又不足與世界新學術競爭。則惟有效法他國。希冀追蹤向上而已。在歐洲東歐靑年之往西歐留學者。多於西歐之往東歐。在亞洲·中國之往日本留學者。多於日本之往中國。美之留英。多於英之留美。蓋西歐之文代程度高於東歐。日本之文代程度商於中國。而英國之文化程度。則高於美國也。故在文化程度較低之國家。多派出洋學生。目的不外借他山之石以攻玉。使自國之文代程度得以迅速提商耳。</p>
<p>雖然吾國出洋留學生之繼續增多。其重要原因。固不僅在文代低落而已。近以中國政治不安。社會擾攘天災人禍。連綿不絕。内憂外患。接踵而來文化機關。絀於經濟。幾莫不瀕於破產。而師資缺乏。學風囂張。以致學潮起伏。循環不息。有志靑年。雖欲安心苦讀而不可得。計惟有别其父兄。抛其妻子。離鄉背井遠涉重洋。以圖關一良好環境之讀書地。此輩靑年。不少抱堅苦卓絕之志。忍飢挨餓。經數年奮鬥之後。居然飽學歸來。頗欲憑其一腔熱誠。满腹經綸。以效勞於國家。服務於社會。結果每爲種種環境所阻。以致心灰意冷壯志全消者。此爲留學生中難得而可貴者也。</p>
<p>其次則有紈袴子弟。挾其多資逍遙海。外借留學之名。行游萬之實。甚且有鄉村子弟。其父兄質田　產。凑合留學費。以供其在海外揮霍之用。終年不報名不聽講。惟日以咖館舞塲。爲消磨歲月之地。或則醇酒婦人。或則恣意賭博。彼父兄日夜祈禱其子弟。早日學成。榮歸故鄉。而詎料其子弟在海外所成就者。爲奢侈。爲消耗。爲無聊之浪人。歸來則非享受現代最舒適之生活不可。做盡現代最可鄙之廢人此乃最可痛心者也。</p>
<p>又其次投機取巧之靑年視留學等於捐官。以留學爲獵取利禄之敲門磗。視留學費用爲睹注。期於他日得十百倍之收獲。覊留海外。不求眞知。不事實學。但冀虛榮。歸以學位炫人。以學者專家自負。依附權勢。乘機鑽營。得以煊赫於一時者有之。於是意志簿弱之靑年。羣起效尤。出洋歸國往復不息。竊恐此輩在留學界中實占可驚之數字。</p>
<p>夫靑年爲國家之棟梁。而留學行尤爲靑年中之優秀份子。乃其所得之結果如斯。則國家之所望於留學生者幾希。吾願本屆出洋留學諸君。堅持毅力。力矯前非。刻苦耐勞。忠勤節儉埋首苦攻。以冷靜之頭腦。觀察異邦之興衰。其有精深之學術·必盡心力以研求·其有敦厚之風尙。必盡心力以揣摩·他日歸來挿身祖國社會。處處以服務爲目的。但求耕耘。不問收穫。但仍努力。不求聞達則點滴冲積。其所貢獻於國家者。必非淺鮮。吾留學諸君乎。際斯内憂外患。國難重重。當切記此行之光陰。至爲珍貴。幸勿在海外虛糜歲月。致他日空手歸來。仍無以應付國家之急難也。</p>

<p>唐先生說··「雖是這樣，講你們的生產比較了近代的機器行產是太慢了，終久必歸淘汰。你們要想不被淘汰，必得採取弗德主義··「一個人一個動作」。」朱先生說··「爲什麽要快？因爲出產比人快，價錢比人廉，可以把人的市場奪」</p>
<p>了來。這純粹是個人竸爭主義在機器搆造上之表現。要想生產快而又快便把工作分得細而又細直到「個人一個動作」爲止。我想把弗德這句話顚倒過來說，更能描寫他的精神。弗德主義的結果是「一個動作一個人」。一個人，一天到晚一年到頭，一世到老專幹這一個單調的動作，若不弄得半死半活，便免不了要發神經病。所以弗德主義是始於以一個人幹一個動作，終於以一個動作毁一個人。他是把好人變成瘋子，把人間變成地獄。你呌弗德自已在汽車工廠裏照「一個人一個動作」的辦法幹他一年半載，看他自已願不願再幹，看他願呌他的兒女去幹，看他還願不願執行這「一個人一個動作」的主張」唐先生說··「你似乎是反對機器，是不是？」朱先生說··「我不是反對機器，不過我覺得我們對於機器的觀念需要，個根本的改變。前人製造機器全副的目光都放在生產上！生產得愈快愈多愈好，便可算是一架盡善盡美的機器。他把用機器的工人完全忽略了。今後科學空發明機器的目光要移轉到工人的身上來。我們要造人用的機器不造奴人的機器··要造益人的機器不造害人的機器··要造養人的機器，不</p>
<p>造滅人的機器。我們的宗旨是要造種種機器使得用　們做工的人可以樂在其中。未來的世界裏只有這人生中心的新機器可以存在。一切奴人害人滅人的機器都要敲得粉碎，放在火爐裹重新造出那人生中心的新機器來。這種人生中心的新機器没有什麽奢望·，牠不想把人間造成天堂·，牠不會把人間造成地獄·，牠的使命是把一個不合理的人間造成一個合理的人問罷了。這便是我們要實現的新機器主義」</p>

<p>各團體多主張依照民三條例</p>
<p>但民三條例實際上未能果行此次中央銀行召集廢兩改元研究委員會、依據專家耿愛德ＥdwardKann之主張、規定新幣重量爲七錢零九厘、成色爲銀八八·銅一二、大致均已解决、僅候財部正式批定、耿氏在華經營金融界、亘二十餘年、對於中國貨幣、研究極深、其主張胥根據於詳細縝密之調查、茲據新聲社探得其調查依據如下、</p>

<h3 id="c207">蔡鍔與王江 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>蔡鍔在老袁監視之下，行使一個金蟬脫殼計，借着酒色自晦··故意娶了一個姨太太，故意吵得家宅不和··甚至，夫婦之間打官司像煞有介事的興起醋海風波，使他的夫人負氣而行。誰知，這是他的手段，先把家眷遣發開來他便可以覷個機會把一雙脚底給老袁看了。號稱機警的老袁畢竟上了他的大當，以致帝制取消，在那糖尿病中，斷送了洪憲皇帝的政治生活。</p>
<p>其實呢，蔡鍔弄的玩意兒，並非創作，從前已有人弄過的··他不過照着原方，略爲增減罷了。明朝遣臣御史王江被淸朝某帥把他留在杭州，盛設供張，待如上賓，但是，王江的愛國心切，常想乘機脫逃，投奔監國，恢復已失的江山。只恨在淸兵監視之下没有機會可走，他便想出這個金蟬脫殼之計。我讀全榭山淸初大文學家全祖望文集，便有一段御史王公的記載··公忽買一妾，呢之甚，於是，夫人晨夜勃谿詬誶，公乃控之吏，而出之。夫人亦攘臂登車，歷數公隱微之過而去鄰人駭焉，公游湖上，防守者以其妾在不疑，而公竟不知所往，乃知向者特以術脫其妻也，公旣脫，携其夫人復入海，朝監國於金門。</p>
<p>蔡松坡的一套把戲，已在二百年前的全榭山文集中拆穿西洋鏡！聽說，老袁左右很多續學之士，在那蔡家夫婦玩這把戲的當兒。倘有人把全榭山文集的這麽一段紀載，翻給洪憲皇帝龍目觀覧，嘿！只怕蔡鍔便跑不掉了！爲什麽當時竟没有人注意這一篇文章？說一句落伍的話，呌做·２命也！運也！</p>

<p>音樂名家劉天華。月前捐館舊都。噩耗驚傅。一時旘與不識。莫不震悼。天華爲劉復（半儂）介弟。兄弟並爲吾鄉聞人。天華旣殁。劉復爲題其象。稱天華於琵琶二胡。造詣最深。琵琶之「十面埋伏」一曲。沈雄奇偉。變化萬千。非天華之大魄力不能舉。其於二胡。尤能自抒妙意。創爲新聲。每引弓一弄。能令聽衆低徊玩味。歌哭無端。感人之深。世罕倫比。二胡本庸微。自有天華。乃登上品。歐西人士有聆天華之樂者。歎謂微此君將不知中國之有樂云。又言天華於所專習者外。凡與音樂有關者。如銅琴銅角古琴隊樂。以乃崑腔京戲佛曲俗曲之類。亦無不悉心鑽研。得其理趣。於和聲作曲之學。及古來律呂之說。亦多所窺覧。又精小提琴。嘗納贊俄國名師託諾夫而學焉。說者謂中西兼擅。理藝並長。而又能會通其間者。當世蓋無第二人。顧恒小心謹愼。不輕述作。故一生所寫僅「二胡琵琶譜」十數種。及「梅蘭芳歌曲譜」一書。均已行世。其未及付印者。有「安次縣吵子會樂譜」及「佛曲譜」兩書。又二胡新譜已成未成者各數種。將由其門弟子整理而刊行之。皆實錄也。而天華一生。亦盡於此矣。吾鄉有二音樂家。並馳譽當世。一鄭覲文。一即劉也。故予有詩哀之云。海「内傅名兩樂人。曰劉曰鄭世無倫。人才一代歸江滸。腕底風濤動八垠。一曲平沙落雁歌。尊前擊節喚如何。廣陵從此無嗣響。勝有寒潮咽逝波。」鄭覲文精古樂。曾手製中國古樂器數十種。皆今世希見之物。今天華已殁。所存僅鄭矣。緬懐賢哲。不禁感慨系之。</p>

<p>（一）　　當一張入學騐試准考證落到手裏時，我就要快活得像已進了這個大學做起福辣虛門魚Freshman哩，多麻煩，檢騐體格，塡寫志願書，審查資格，繳納報名費，代錢代力，現在這初步的難關全克服了。</p>
<p>（二）　　是快到十二點鐘了，怱怱的交了卷出來，首見那邊一扇黑門上留着幾個潦草的粉筆字</p>
<p>「汽車費加大菜錢等於報名費」。　　「嗚呼！窮學生的肚子餓呵！没飯吃！」</p>
<p>我猛想起了·檢查體格費，照像費報名費，車費，我祗領得了三個大學的准考證，就被榨取掉了十五隻大洋！　　（三）　　峋驕傲地說，他去考了二個大學，多得了七個女友，全是挺摩登的！　　（四）　　楝指給我看，這個穿西裝的，他去考浙大時曾碰到過，菲指給我看，那個脸塗得白白的女子，他去考滬大時。伊是坐在他旁的座位上的。啊，我細細的把各個脸看了一下，其中有許多我是似乎認識的·不是嗎·我去考那二個大學時在考塲上見到過的嗎？</p>
<p>（五）　　考卷才發出五分鐘，一個少年汗流满面的奔進考塲，他哀求監考者允許給他參與考試，說··</p>
<p>「今天是最後的　塲了，我打幾千里的雲南趕到上海來考學校，可憐讓我完塲了罷！」</p>
<p>「不，按例，按章程是不得通融的！」</p>
<p>也祗得流着熱淚退出去了。</p>
<p>（六）　　某國立大學國文試騐除做一篇作文以外，又出了二個對子·，一是少小離家老大回，二是孫行者，據調查的結果，放棄第一對的十佔八九，平時對於戲劇頗有研究的陳君答了一事無成兩鬢白，對第二題的，大多數寫上了猪八戒，或牛魔皇，這二個不是全是老孫的仇家嗎？</p>

<p>— 燧丞</p>
<p>首都花園。如鼓樓公園。濤園。胡家花園等。或則荒穢不治。或則簡陋湫隘。皆不足道。惟復成橋畔第一公園。佔地廣袤。又不近市　。獨擅幽勝。故游園者爭趨之。其南與公共體育塲。僅一河之隔。河水淸瑩。游魚或數。夾岸密栽垂柳。景緻淸麗。與十里秦淮。殊堪媲美。園中有烈士祠。有紀念塔。有圖書館。有博物館。又有佳木奇葩。珍禽異獸之屬。凡所以崇先烈。紀豐功。悅耳目。娯心意者。莫不畢備。烈士祠中。名人聯句甚多。但皆尊崇先烈之詞。無關園游。惟公園大門之内。向鐫有一聯云。「到此遣悉懷。但願毋忘革命。歸來齊奮鬥。切莫留戀斯園。」辭意動人。語氣不柔不剛。恰到好處。余甚愛之。</p>
<p>中央黨部。地當丁家橋之東。原爲省議會舊址。其中嘉木葱蘢。好花如錦。在昔本已有園林之勝。自改爲黨部後闢地加廣。經之營之。不遣餘力。以故四時有不絕之花。三冬多不凋之木。池有魚。塘有荷。水木明瑟。風物幽美。雖第一公園。殆無以過之。在政治會議秘書處與統計處之間。又有泉水一泓。蜿蜒如帶。蓮葉田田。满佈其中。兩岸多植楊柳梧。濃陰匝地。躑躅其間。欲都蠲復有長橋。横亙水上。彫欄極精。　作灰白色。與綠柳紅荷。輝映成趣。遠而望之。眞有「長橋臥波。未雲何龍」之槪。如此勝境。在首都誠不可多得。惜機關所在。門禁森嚴。外人無由問津耳。</p>

<p>曲曲兒　　蟋蟀一微物。有値數十金者。貯以澄槳之罐。飼以蟹白栗黄之食。寳而養之。待時而鬥。喪金費時。胥爲一啄之戲。可知舊京十族汰侈。實不止聲色珠玉已也。帝京景物略云七月始鬥促織。鬥有場。場有主者。其養之又有師。鬥盆筒罐。無家不備。則知前明此風更有甚於今日者。</p>

<p>燕京歳時記云。北人呼螻蟈曰聒聒兒。蟋蟀曰曲曲兒。北都五月以後則有聒聒兒沿街呌賣。每枚不過一二文。至十月則攤熅者生。每枚可値數千矣。七月中旬則有曲曲兒。貴者可値數金。有白麻頭黄麻頭蟹胲靑琵琶翅梅花翅竹節鬚之别。以其能戰鬥也。至十月。一枚不過數百文。取其鳴而已矣。曲曲兒之類又有油葫蘆。當秋令時。一文可買十餘枚。至十月則一枚可値數千文。蓋其鳴時　鏘斷緒。　而長。冬夜聽之。可悲可喜。眞閒人之韻事也。故秋日之曲曲罐。有永樂官窑趙子玉淡園主人靜軒主人紅澄槳白槳澄之别。佳考數十金一對。冬月之聒聒兒葫蘆油葫蘆葫蘆。佳者亦數十金一對。以紮潤堅厚者爲上。卽所謂葫蘆器者是也。按日下舊聞考永定門外五里胡家村產促織。善鬥。勝他產。促織者。感秋而生。其音。商其性勝。今都人能種之。留其鳴深冬。其法實土於盆養之。蟲生子土中。入冬以其土置煖炕。日水洒綿覆之。伏五六日。上蠕蠕動。又伏七八日。如蛆然。置子蔬葉。仍洒覆之。足翅成。漸以黑。匝月則鳴。細於秋。入春反　也。促織卽蟋蟀别種。其别有三。肥大而色澤如油者曰油葫蘆。首大者曰梆子頭。銳喙者曰老米嘴云云。往時纨袴王孫無所事事。則陶情於此擲巨貲無吝色。今亦少有嗜此者。惟里巷小兒時以爲戲而已　　又燕　京雜記云。京師有草蟲。狀如蟋蟀。肥大而靑。生於夏秋間。聲喞喞甚聒耳。京師人多籠以佩之。佳者十餘金一頭。其籠以小葫蘆去其上截爲之。四圍雕花鳥以通氣。精細工絕。價有貴至百金者。八旂满洲婦人多有空其鞋底以納之。使其聲與履相應。若行肆夏趨采齊者然。今此俗幾廢矣。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>著名漢奸胡立夫，自此次閘北戰事起後，胡遂被日人利用，一時利令智昏，甘爲漢奸，我軍退第二道防線時，彼曾與同黨常玉淸飛龍阿根等，無惡不作，閘北居民，受害非淺，昨晨十時，日人原三，約胡晚餐，致被弋獲，他的罪名如何，自有國家法律來裁判，我可不必多說。</p>
<p>惟據胡立夫供，渠有三子，均有高尙職業，現因渠之關係，皆被歇在家，今夜赴新雅吃飯，實受日人原三之愚，得錢賣友云云，但原三是否得錢賣友，在未有確鑿證據以前，我不必下以斷語，惟其三子，均有高尙職業因爲渠之關係，二子皆被歇業，此事必係事實，語云「一身做事一身當，」若做漢奸，則其禍不但及於其身，而并及其子孫，如僅爲幾隻飯碗問題，尙屬小事，因爲胡旣做漢奸，自有漢奸的相當代價，當可不必過慮，不過他人說起來，總是某漢奸之子某漢奸之孫，此種名譽上之損失，恐不僅此幾隻飯碗問題也，此爲漢奸的一個榜樣。</p>
<p>溥儀鄭孝胥輩，满面孔欲罩日人的牌頭，做他們復辟的好夢，大談其以夷制華之歷史，爲他們文過飾非的張本，現在的好夢也應該醒了，近日日政府又派武藤就關東司令官，政界要人，大餞其宴，此舉完全爲侵略統一案之實現，溥儀鄭孝胥輩的好夢，更應該醒了，但是到了現在，好夢雖醒，也已是來不及了，漢奸的頭銜，已經戴上，無論用西江的水，也洗不掉，就是用科學方法去揩，也揩不掉，這還不足以警戒這幾個漢奸，他們的報應，恐還在後頭，這又一個漢奸的榜樣。</p>
<p>但是這樣類似的漢奸，殺得盡麽，死得盡麽，曰决死不盡，近日新發現的漢奸，正如雨後春笋，方興未艾，我也無他言說，祇有請他們留心一點，看看幾個榜樣。</p>

<p>— 白洪</p>
<p>夏秋之間，雷聲隆隆，前幾天的霹靂大雷，灌耳欲聾。這種奇偉的天界現象，時常引起一般人的恐怖心理。</p>
<p>雷究竟是什麽？天空的雷是那裏來的？如果你要懂的這些，我們必須先來談談電。天上的電也和我們地下電燈，電車上所用的電一樣。這在一百八十年以前（即一七五二年），已經由一位美國人呌富蘭克林證明過了。他用風箏把天空的電接下來，發生閃電。這是很危險的實騐，一個不好便會被雷擊死。</p>
<p>現在，我們所要知道的是··天空的電那裏來的？電是由雨點來的。每逢下雨起暴的時候，才有雷電，這是大家所看得到的。在雷雨之前，天空時常有一種雲出現，那雲底部墨黑，頂上蓬蓬然奇峯崛起，猶如山岳。其後，雲峯突然潰崩，雷便隆隆的來了。這時候，天空的上升氣流（即從地面向天空上方流的空氣。）極旺盛。雨點從高空落下來的時候，便爲這種極强的上升氣流所吹破，仍然變爲細水點，上升而爲雲。雲在高空遇着冷又復凝結起來而爲大雨點下降，但又爲上升的氣流所吹破。如此，往復了千百次之後，雨點中便帶着多量的陽電，帶陰電的空氣便升到雲的上方，陽電和陰電不斷的分離，最後，陽電愈積愈多，陰電也愈積愈多，到了後麷，牠們互相吸引的力量極大，空氣不能担任絕緣的工作的時候，也就是說，空氣的阻力有限，不能抵抗陰陽兩電互相吸引的力了。那末，陰陽兩電衝破了中間隔着的空氣，而接觸。接觸的地方，發出閃閃的電光，俗呌霍電，科學家謂之「閃電」。</p>
<p>在這陰陽兩電，互相吸引起放電作用的地方，因爲放出多量的熱，這時候，這一部的空氣因受多量的熱便即速膨脤而飛升，幾乎成了眞空。於是，四周的冷空氣用着極大的速力向眞空衝了進來，因此，空氣與空氣相衝激而發出巨大的響聲，那就是我們所聽到的雷。</p>
<p>雷聲到了我們耳裏的時候，危險的時期已經過去。因爲光要此聲音走得快。音每秒鐘平均只能走三四○粎，如果你在看到閃電之後，計算經過若干秒後聽到雷聲的時間，就能算出你所在的地方離雷有多少遠。</p>
<p>天空的雲與雲之間放電，危險較少。如果天空的雲與地面起放電作用，那就很危險，人畜，樹屋，一觸即毁。在大雷雨的時候，要避雷電最好離開大樹，電桿木，高璧，尤不宜站在潮濕的地方，身上也不能淋得盡濕，因爲這些都容易傅電，很危險，。</p>

<p>在赤傘稍歛的下午，游玩的，買物的，燒香的，擁擁擠擠，把邑廟的空氣，換上了緊張的，閙熱的。</p>

<p>一好友，不是嗎？他們都圍着了賣洋翡翠首飾的店中呢！</p>
<p>叮咚叮咚······連續地嚮着，把一切微弱的聲音都壓迫下去，刺入了人們的耳鼓，呵！這是西洋鏡的招攬看客吧！湖心亭··是邑廟好風景之一，九曲橋下的龜兒和魚兒，在凉風吹皺的波面上游着，不時地伸首呼吸空氣，引誘立在橋上的人們，爭看牠們的自然和快樂。可惜··湖心亭畔設了一個小便處，一股臭氣直往四下傅送，好似預防疫氣的臭藥水哩。</p>
<p>十殿王呀！星宿呀！城隍呀！一切的一切，都充着神秘化，這是我們貴國的特有藝術吧！「先生！太太！香燭要麽？」一陣陣的聲浪，怪討厭的在耳邊經過。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Encouraging This Year's Students Studying Abroad <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The season of summer has arrived. Every year, there is a large group of young people going abroad to study. Even now, during this time of national crisis, when all industries are declining, the number of students going abroad is still very enthusiastic. Could it be that our China has so many people with great ambitions for distant travels? It is, in fact, for the sake of seeking knowledge that they must do so.</p>
<p>In countries with the highest levels of culture, there are the fewest young people going abroad to study. This is because their own country's education has reached perfection, so there is no need to seek it elsewhere. At most, they might travel abroad after completing their studies, as a means of observation and research. Conversely, in countries with lower levels of culture, there will inevitably be more young people going abroad to study. This is because their own country's education is not sufficient to meet the needs of the new era, nor is it sufficient to compete with the world's new academic disciplines. Therefore, the only option is to emulate other countries, hoping to catch up and improve. In Europe, young people from Eastern Europe go to Western Europe to study more often than young people from Western Europe go to Eastern Europe. In Asia, Chinese people go to Japan to study more often than Japanese people go to China. Americans study in England more often than English study in America. This is because the culture of Western Europe is more advanced than that of Eastern Europe, the culture of Japan is more advanced than that of China, and the culture of England is more advanced than that of America. Therefore, countries with lower levels of culture send more students abroad, with the aim of using the stones from other mountains to polish their own jade, so that their own country's level of culture can be rapidly improved.</p>
<p>However, the continued increase in the number of students studying abroad from our country is not solely due to cultural backwardness. Recently, due to China's political instability, social unrest, and continuous natural and man-made disasters, internal and external troubles have followed one after another. Cultural institutions are constrained by economic difficulties and are almost on the verge of bankruptcy. Furthermore, there is a lack of teachers and a prevalence of academic arrogance, leading to recurring waves of student unrest. Young people with aspirations are unable to concentrate on their studies. The only option is to bid farewell to their parents and siblings, abandon their wives and children, and leave their homes to travel far across the oceans in order to find a good place to study. Many of these young people have the ambition to endure hardship and persevere. After years of struggle, enduring hunger and cold, they eventually return with a wealth of knowledge. They eagerly desire to serve the country and society with their enthusiasm and knowledge. However, they are often hindered by various circumstances, leading to discouragement and the complete dissipation of their ambitions. These are rare and valuable students.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are纨绔子弟 who use their wealth to travel leisurely abroad, using the name of studying abroad to indulge in travel. There are even rural youths whose parents and siblings mortgage their fields and properties to raise tuition fees, only to have them squandered overseas. They do not enroll in classes or attend lectures, but spend their days in cafes and dance halls, wasting their time. Some indulge in wine and women, while others gamble recklessly. Their parents and siblings pray day and night for their children to complete their studies and return home in glory, but they do not realize that what their children are accomplishing overseas is extravagance, consumption, and becoming idle vagrants. Upon returning, they demand to enjoy the most comfortable modern life and engage in the most contemptible modern idleness. This is the most heartbreaking.</p>
<p>And then there are the opportunistic youths who view studying abroad as equivalent to buying an official position, using studying abroad as a stepping stone to acquire wealth and status. They see the cost of studying abroad as a gamble, hoping to reap tenfold or hundredfold rewards in the future. They stay overseas, not seeking true knowledge or practical skills, but only desiring vanity. Upon returning, they flaunt their degrees and claim to be scholars and experts. They attach themselves to powerful figures and seize opportunities to advance their careers, achieving temporary prominence. As a result, young people with weak wills follow suit, going abroad and returning repeatedly. I fear that this type of person actually accounts for an alarming number in the study abroad community.</p>
<p>Young people are the pillars of the nation, and students studying abroad are particularly outstanding members of the youth. However, if the results they achieve are like this, then the nation's hopes for students studying abroad will be minimal. I hope that all of you students studying abroad this year will persist in your determination, strive to correct past mistakes, endure hardship and be industrious, and diligently and frugally bury yourselves in your studies. Use your calm minds to observe the rise and fall of foreign countries. Diligently study any profound academic disciplines, and earnestly emulate any virtuous customs. In the future, when you return and join society in your home country, always aim to serve. Seek only to cultivate, not to reap. Seek only to strive, not to be famous. Then, through gradual accumulation, your contributions to the country will be significant. O, students studying abroad! In this time of internal and external troubles and great national crisis, you must remember that the time of this trip is extremely precious. Please do not waste your time overseas, lest you return empty-handed in the future and still be unable to cope with the country's urgent needs.</p>

<p>On the 13th, the National Government issued an order stating that the President of the Judicial Yuan, Ju Zheng, had presented a request from the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee to appoint Liu Boying and Liu Weiling as secretaries of the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee, which should be approved. This order. Another order: According to a report from the Judicial Yuan, the former Magistrate of Xianju County, Zhejiang Province, Wei Junming, was accused and sentenced to imprisonment for strictly handling bandits under provincial orders and shooting Wang Qing. After review by the court, it was found that the victim, Wang Qing, was originally a notorious bandit. After surrendering, he served as the head of the Beach Defense Corps in that county. He then privately imprisoned Fu Zhuphan and demanded a large sum of money, and deliberately resisted arrest. When the county magistrate returned to the city, Wang Qing's gang incited a prison break. Given the weak city defenses, and fearing other changes, he convened a meeting of party, government, military, and police officials, who resolved to execute him. Although the execution was carried out without prior approval, considering the circumstances at the time, it was an expedient measure to deal with the emergency and the crime was committed in the line of duty. The circumstances are extremely excusable, and it is proposed to grant him a special pardon. This should be approved immediately, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the revised Organic Law of the National Government of the Republic of China, it is declared that Wei Junming, who was originally sentenced to three years and four months of imprisonment, is granted a special pardon and exempted from serving the sentence to show leniency and solicitude.

<h3 id="e58">German Cabinet Formation Negotiations Break Down <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Hitler Unwilling to Accept the Position of Deputy Chancellor</p>
<p>Papen Relies on Hindenburg as Support</p>
<p>Preparing to Continue Holding Power</p>
<p>And Deal with the New Reichstag</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 13th - The Papen government, after the breakdown of negotiations with National Socialist leader Hitler, is now preparing to continue holding power and deal with the new Reichstag. This move will amount to a challenge to the Reichstag. If the Reichstag wants to overthrow the government, the Papen government may respond by dissolving the Reichstag. Although Hitler today firmly stated to President Hindenburg and Chancellor Papen that he has no intention of seizing power through illegal actions, he also warned that he and the National Socialist Party will actively oppose the government in the Reichstag. Therefore, if the government does not fail when the Reichstag convenes in the future, it will not be the fault of the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 13th - German President Hindenburg has firmly rejected Hitler's request to hand over the government to the National Socialist Party. He explicitly told Hitler that he felt he could not bear the responsibility of assigning all power to one party, either to the country or to his own conscience. This was the result of Hindenburg's meeting with Hitler this afternoon. Chancellor Papen, State Secretary Meisner of the Presidential Palace, and National Socialist Party figures Frick and Röhm were all present. The conversation lasted only twenty minutes. Afterwards, a public statement was issued tonight stating that the President had asked Hitler whether he and other relevant figures in the party were prepared to join Chancellor Papen's cabinet. Hitler answered in the negative and went on to request that he be given the position of Prime Minister and all state power. The President then expressed regret that Hitler had failed to consider his position and to honor the promises he made before the election to support the national government trusted by the President. He then earnestly urged Hitler to oppose the government in the spirit of righteousness and not to forget his responsibility to the country and his compatriots. The statement also said that before visiting the President, Hitler had met with Chancellor Papen. Papen proposed recommending Hitler to the President as Deputy Chancellor and assigning important cabinet positions to relevant figures in the National Socialist Party, so that the National Socialist movement could be given the power it deserves in administration, according to its strength. According to reliable sources, when German President Hindenburg met with Hitler, he maintained a stern and resolute attitude throughout. The President told Hitler that if there were any attempts to use violence to disrupt order in the country, he and the federal government were determined to eliminate them in their infancy and would not allow them to grow. He also had the strength to do so. However, political circles believe that the idea that the National Socialist Party intends to seize power by force is an overestimation. Hitler explicitly denied that the party intended to advance on Berlin when he visited the President, which further proves the lack of basis for this claim. Hitler has now left Berlin tonight but is expected to return to Beijing before the 16th to preside over a meeting of all the leaders of the National Socialist Party. This meeting will be held on the 16th and 17th to decide the party's future course of action. It is reported that Hitler visited General Schleicher, the Chief of the General Staff of the National Defense, this morning. The content of the conversation is unknown. He then visited Chancellor Papen for two hours. It is said that Hitler solemnly stated his position, saying that he also agreed to a non-partisan cabinet, but the National Socialist Party is not an ordinary political party, but a public movement, so it must be given all political power. However, Papen was unmoved by this and still refused to agree to the party's request for the cabinet to resign. Therefore, political circles now believe that the Papen cabinet will not be reorganized for the time being and will ask the new Reichstag to vote on a vote of confidence two weeks later after it convenes. However, what will happen if the new Reichstag does not support the cabinet? At this time, there is much speculation. Before leaving Beijing for his villa in East Prussia tonight, President Hindenburg expressed his hope to Chancellor Papen that the most urgent task now that the political situation has become clear is the unemployment problem, and that he should make every effort to solve it. He also stated that the Chancellor could get his full support in implementing the unemployment relief plan.</p>

<p>Hirota Scheduled to Leave Russia for Japan Within Days</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 13th - Russian-Japanese negotiations on a Japanese fishing agreement, which have lasted for eighteen months, finally resulted in the signing of an agreement today. All the points of contention in the 1928 agreement have now been resolved in the new agreement.</p>

<p>Japanese Again Advocate Leaving the League of Nations</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th - Deputy Chief of Staff Masaki, acting on behalf of General Kan'in yesterday, met with Commander of the Kwantung Army Muto, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army Koiso, and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army Okamura at the General Staff Headquarters. After conveying the instructions of the Commander-in-Chief to the important tasks of the Kwantung Army, he explained in detail the issues of troop deployment, combat operations, transportation, and Japanese-Manchurian defense in the future.

This conference of army leaders was to discuss and decide the supreme policy of the military towards Manchuria.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th - A part of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is clamoring for a debate over leaving the League of Nations and not sending representatives to the General Assembly, based on the following reasons: (1) Japan has no expectations for the report of the investigation team; (2) As a result of the formal recognition of Manchukuo, it is a completely separate and newly independent country with no relation to China. Therefore, regarding the Manchurian problem, there is no reason to entrust the settlement between China and Japan to the League of Nations.</p>

<p>The Military Commission Branch Will Take Over the Pacification Headquarters' Affairs</p>
<p>Zhang Decides to Arrange the Troops Properly Before Going to Europe</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: The abolition of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters due to Zhang Xueliang's resignation has become an inevitable trend. It is reported that the decision was made the day before yesterday (12th). Because Zhang's intention to resign is very firm, and the work of suppressing bandits in the south is very urgent, and there is no suitable person who can come north to succeed him, after repeated discussions between Peiping and Hankou, it was decided to set up a branch of the Military Commission in Peiping to take over the affairs of the Pacification Headquarters, so that Zhang can quickly unload his responsibilities. In addition to Han, Xu, Shang, Song, Pang, and others who were originally members of the North China Military Reorganization Committee and naturally joined the branch of the Military Commission, the central government will probably also join a few people who have considerable qualifications and have emotional ties with the North China generals, such as Fang Benren and Jiang Bocheng. It is expected that they all have hope. Once agreed, the approval of Zhang's resignation and the abolition of the Pacification Headquarters will be announced at the same time. However, it is important to note whether Zhang Xueliang is listed in this branch of the Military Commission. It is said that Zhang expressed to people that he absolutely does not want to ask about political affairs anymore. Regarding military affairs, I am willing to dedicate my troops to the central government, so that they become national troops that live up to their name, and I do not want to leave the impression on society of the old warlords who each privately own their troops. However, my direct troops have a history of more than ten years, and there are too many things that I have handled personally, so I cannot but clear them up properly. Therefore, during the transition period, regardless of whether there is a title, I will work hard to arrange the troops properly, so as to avoid the central government's worries about the north. In other words, my sincere intention is to be in the position of a staff member, assisting the branch of the Military Commission to properly handle the aftermath, even if there is a title, I will eventually decline it, even if there is no</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Title, I am still willing to be responsible for it in the short term. It is reported that Zhang decided to move to Xishan within days. Once he has cleared everything up and arranged everything properly within a short period of time, he will go to Europe to travel, change his environment, recuperate, breathe in new trends, and increase his knowledge. His overseas plans have been basically finalized, and he intends to take his wife and older children with him. According to people close to Zhang, Zhang has been comforting and encouraging his subordinates separately, urging them to work with peace of mind. Before he goes abroad, he will be responsible for handling the aftermath well, so society can rest assured. As for Zhang's overseas itinerary, he will first go to Germany, Turkey, and Italy, because they are all countries that have struggled out of difficulties. After the inspection, he will then go to France. After arranging his family properly, he will go to the UK to study. The scheduled period is about two years. If there is an opportunity, he will go to Russia to inspect again. He will not go to the United States for the time being. (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Chiang and Shen Go to Peiping from Jinan <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Government Conference Discusses Public Security in North China</p>
<p>Chiang, Han, Shen, and Others All Make Speeches Jinan Correspondence: Military Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, due to the successive resignations of Wang Jingwei and Zhang Xueliang, specially sent Jiang Bocheng from Peiping to Jinan to meet with Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu to discuss ways to maintain North China. Qingdao Mayor and Naval Commander Shen Honglie and Jiaoji Railway Committee Chairman Ge Guangting also arrived in Jinan from Qingdao yesterday to meet with Chiang and Han to discuss important matters. This morning, Han and Jiang received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, stating that Director Zhang's resignation had been approved. Therefore, Han, Jiang, Shen, and others gathered at the Provincial Government to exchange opinions and discussed the future aftermath in North China. Jiang Bocheng then returned to Peiping from Jinan that evening, and Shen Honglie also went north with him to visit Zhang Xueliang to report on the Jinan talks. The situation of Jiang and Shen leaving Jinan and their talks are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Important Conference of the Provincial Government Today, Chiang Kai-shek's telegram to Han, Jiang, and others, the content roughly stated that "Director Zhang's resignation has now been approved. All military affairs will be handled by the North China Military Reorganization Committee. I will soon go to Peiping to take charge." After this telegram arrived in Jinan, Han Fuqu, Shen Honglie, Jiang Bocheng, Ge Guangting, Peng Shibin, and others gathered at the Provincial Government for an important conference to discuss in detail the aftermath in North China. It is said that Han Fuqu expressed at the meeting that he had no opinion and would obey Commander-in-Chief Chiang in everything. Shen Honglie expressed that although he was from the Northeast, he would also obey the central government. Therefore, the meeting was very harmonious. Jiang Bocheng and Shen Honglie decided to take the 202nd train on the Pingpu Line at 6:40 PM this afternoon due to factual necessity. Before 6:00 PM this morning, important people arrived at the station to see them off, including Finance Director Wang Xiangrong, Industry Director Wang Fangting, Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun, Higher Court President Wu Zhenzuan, Central Bank Branch Manager Xu Jizhuang, Provincial Government Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang, General Headquarters Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang, Zhang Xueliang's representative in Jinan Peng Shibin, Jiaoji Railway Committee Chairman Ge Guangting, Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie, etc. Han Fuqu, Wang Fangting, and Xu Jizhuang talked with Jiang Bocheng at the Central Bank. At 6:20, they took a car to the station. Shen Honglie also rushed over from the Jiaoji Hotel.</p>
<p>The Talks of Chiang, Han, and Others (1) Jiang Bocheng said, Commander-in-Chief Chiang sent a telegram this morning, the gist of which was that Director Zhang (Xueliang) was determined to resign, and after ineffective retention, the request has been approved. After Zhang's resignation, the position of Pacification Director will no longer be commissioned. The Peiping Pacification Headquarters has decided to abolish it. All military affairs will be handled by the North China Military Reorganization Committee. The Commander-in-Chief also serves as the Chairman, and political affairs will be handled by the Political Reorganization Committee. Zhang Yuejun (Qun) also sent a telegram from Peiping to report on this matter. Chairman Han has always followed the opinions of the Commander-in-Chief, and he absolutely obeys the handling of this matter. Mayor Shen (Honglie) agrees. The great disturbances in North China can now come to an end. Commander-in-Chief Chiang highly praised Chairman Han for maintaining the overall situation and acting as a pillar in the midst of the storm. I was ordered to come to Jinan. The results of the talks were satisfactory. Now that the matter has been completed, I will return to Peiping temporarily today. As for the resignation of Mr. Wang (Jingwei), it is not yet known how to resolve it. (2) Han Fuqu said, The telegram that the Commander-in-Chief sent to me is similar to the telegram sent to the Chief Counselor (Jiang Bocheng). After Director Zhang's resignation and the abolition of the Pacification Headquarters, Commander-in-Chief Chiang will arrive in Peiping to take charge in the shortest possible time, because other than the Commander-in-Chief, no one else can shoulder this heavy responsibility. The rumor that I will go to Peiping to preside over everything is absolutely not true, because I know that my ability is weak, and even if the central government orders me to go, I would not dare to go. I absolutely obey the Commander-in-Chief's handling of this matter. From my observation, there will be absolutely no civil war in North China, and the overall situation can be safely overcome. However, the diplomacy is urgent, and what will happen in the future is not yet known. But if there is no diplomatic aggression, things may not happen again. Foreign enemies can promote unity among all parties, which may not be a blessing. Mayor Shen came here because of Director Zhang's resignation and the troubled times. Qingdao is the gateway to North China. I came to Jinan to discuss everything with each other. There are no other tasks. (3) Shen Honglie said, Director Zhang originally intended to resign earlier, and now fortunately it has been approved. I seek benevolence and get benevolence, and my initial wish has been fulfilled. All generals in North China and the Northeast take the entire country as a concept. As for Director Zhang's resignation, we leave it to the central government to handle it and do not express it separately. I came to Jinan this time because of the changing situation and came to talk with Chairman Han about everything. Because I have been in the Northeast for a long time, now that Director Zhang has resigned, I should go to visit him. I can return to Qingdao in about a week. As for the Qingdao area, it is as peaceful as ever. I am currently designing and carrying out various construction plans. (4) Ge Guangting said, When Zhang Yushuai (Zuolin) was alive, Director Zhang was appointed as the commander of the army. At that time, he often wanted to quit, but it was ultimately impossible. Now the central government has approved his resignation, and he has fulfilled his wish. I came to Jinan with Mayor Shen this time and have no mission. (August 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Tiger Plague and Flood Disaster in Shanxi Province <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Tiger Plague Spreads to Sixteen Counties</p>
<p>Taiyuan Flood Submerges Half the City  Taiyuan Dispatch: Since the coup d'état in Shanxi Province the year before last, the people have suffered both from the devastation of Shanxi currency and the harassment of stationed troops and bandits.  Coupled with the heavy burden of supplies, the people are impoverished and their resources exhausted. The losses from before have not yet been recovered, and recently a tiger plague has broken out, spreading to the north and south corners of the province.  The worst-hit areas have reached as many as sixteen counties.  Even the vicinity of the provincial capital has been affected.  The daily death toll throughout the province is no less than several dozen.  Just as people were panicking and trying to prevent the tiger plague, news came that the southwestern half of Taiyuan City was submerged in water.  The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in recent years.  The details of the tiger plague throughout the province and the flood disaster in the provincial capital are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Tiger Plague Spreads in Southern Shanxi. The tiger plague has spread to Anyi, Wenxi, Ronghe, and other counties, with a significant number of deaths.  Upon receiving the report, the Provincial Epidemic Prevention Bureau immediately dispatched committee members and doctors to prevent and treat the disease.  Regarding the previous report that the tiger plague had advanced to Datong and Hequ, the Provincial Epidemic Prevention Bureau recently sent personnel to investigate and verify, which has been confirmed.  According to the examination results, tiger plague germs were found in the excrement of the dead.  When these germs were used to inoculate rabbits, the rabbits died immediately.  The main cause of the tiger plague is eating raw and cold melons and fruits.  A committee for epidemic prevention has been established in Datong to carry out treatment and prevention, and medical police have been dispatched to the PingSui Railway Station to inspect passengers and prevent patients from entering the area.  For the purpose of preventing the tiger plague in Taiyuan City, the Provincial Epidemic Prevention Bureau has ordered the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau to set up a quarantine station outside the Xin Nan Men (New South Gate) train station.  All passengers traveling to and from the Zhengtai Railway and various bus routes must undergo inspection.  Those who are sick will be sent to the hospital for treatment and will not be allowed to mix with healthy people.  According to official news, a throat ailment has recently been discovered in the Lingchuan County area, spreading rapidly and causing extreme panic among the people.  The rat plague in the Xingxian and Linxian counties of western Shanxi has also been extremely severe recently.  Statistics show that the epidemic area throughout the province has reached as many as sixteen counties.</p>
<p>Fen River Breaches its Banks:  Taiyuan City has experienced consecutive days of heavy rain, resulting in mountain torrents.  The Sha River and Fen River simultaneously breached their banks last evening (the 7th).  The southwestern corners of the provincial capital, as well as hundreds of miles downstream, were submerged in water.  The extent of the loss cannot yet be accurately estimated, but it must be no less than several million.  Officials dispatched seven or eight thousand soldiers yesterday to urgently block the breaches.  However, the banks have already been breached and the water is vast, so it will be difficult to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>The Disaster in the Provincial Capital: The disaster situation in the provincial capital is extremely severe.  Looking west from the Xin Nan Men (New South Gate) city wall, the water level has risen to a point slightly beyond the West Road Bus Station.  The vast expanse of water resembles a river or sea.  All the houses of the residents have been submerged, and more than half have collapsed.  The Jinheng Paper Mill is submerged in several feet of water.  Men, women, old, and young are all crossing eastward on wooden boards.  Furniture and belongings are mostly abandoned in the water.  Mules, horses, and livestock are running wildly on the surface of the water, creating a chaotic scene as if they are lost at sea.  Hundreds of rickshaws are lined up along the Jinxi (Shanxi-West) Motor Road, waiting for the refugees to escape to the riverbank to transport and rescue them.  The riverbank and the city wall are crowded with people, and the sound of weeping is unbearable.  Near the Da Nan Men (Great South Gate), the water level is about seven or eight feet high.  On the morning of the 8th, after the Fen River breached its banks, officials immediately dispatched soldiers to the Shui Han Xi Men (Water-Drought West Gate) and the Da Nan Men (Great South Gate) to prevent and protect the city.  Around 10:00 AM, the water at Da Nan Guan (Great South Pass) actually breached the city gate and entered.  The soldiers urgently blocked the inner city gate.  Unexpectedly, the water became increasingly powerful and broke open the city gate inside.  The soldiers hurriedly climbed the city walls and threw sacks of sand and stones from above to block the gate outside.  After a long time, the water level subsided slightly.  However, the accumulated water in the city gate tunnel was already seven or eight feet deep.  Fearing that the water would flow into the main streets and submerge the merchants and residents, the soldiers dug a large channel westward under the city wall, allowing the water to flow west to the southwest corner of the city.  Until about 3:00 PM, the soldiers were still throwing sacks on the city walls to block the gates.  As for the Shui Han Xi Men (Water-Drought West Gate) area, the water level from the West Road Bus Station through the Da Nan Guan (Great South Pass) and the Shui Xi Men (Water West Gate) reached the southern end of the Han Xi Men (Drought West Gate).  The vast expanse of water merged with the sky.  The Shui Han Liang Xi Men (Water-Drought Both West Gates) were also blocked by soldiers with sacks.  The accumulated water at the gates was about four or five feet deep.  The western dam outside the city had almost been leveled by the water and merged with the Fen River.  The northwestern dam outside the city had also almost been leveled by the water.  The Sha River and Fen River surged simultaneously after the heavy rain on the evening of the 7th.  By the morning of the 8th, three breaches suddenly occurred in the dams, each about four or five feet wide.  The water flowed eastward through the breaches, resulting in a major disaster.  As of today, the water is still surging eastward.</p>

<p>Water Rises Sharply by a Foot at Zhukou</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Yellow River has risen again in recent days, with the autumn water surging powerfully.  The downstream areas of Dama Village and Wangzao Village, as well as the upstream areas of Zhukou and Lisheng Village, are again reporting emergencies.  Zhang Lianjia, the Director of the River Affairs Bureau, is at Dama Village, directing the rescue efforts, and the situation is stable. However, the collapse trend at Wangzao Village is shifting downward, and the fish scales are collapsing one after another. Two hundred engineers and newly arrived laborers are transporting willows and stones and filling burlap sacks to protect the base of the dike. Gao Daotian, the Magistrate of Huimin County, and Pan Yifen, the Section Chief of the Engineering Section of the River Affairs Bureau, are currently at the site directing the rescue.  The water at Zhukou upstream has risen sharply by a foot, and the main current is pushing downward, directly impacting Liuzhuang Guanting. If the water rises again, the situation will be quite precarious.  At Lisheng Village, the water continues to rise, the main current is surging, and each bar is only a few inches above the water. Starting last night, both places have hired additional night workers to assist the employees in throwing burlap sacks, building cofferdams, and pressing down the soil. The River Affairs Bureau has telegraphed Chen Wenmo, the Chief of the upper reaches section, ordering him to use bricks and stones to build a cofferdam at Zhukou, approving the purchase of 50 stacks of materials, and adding a cofferdam at Lisheng Village to ensure safety. Today, the water at Luokou continues to rise by 3.7 centimeters, equivalent to 1 foot and 1.1 inches in the city scale, with a water level of 29.47 meters, equivalent to 8 zhang, 8 chi, and 4.1 inches in the city scale.

<h3 id="e72">Communist Bandits Plan to Defend the East Bank of the Gan River <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong Army Determined to Launch a Full-Scale Attack on the Bandit Stronghold: Nanchang Dispatch: According to a letter from Ganzhou, the 1st, 3rd, and 5th pseudo-army corps have retreated from Xinfeng and scattered into two major groups. One group fled along the Gong River through Dabuzhangluo in southern Ganzhou to Yudu and Xingguo, and the other group passed through the east bank of Tao River, through Anyuan, and entered Huichang. In recent days, the Guangdong army has gradually concentrated in Xinfeng and will launch a full-scale attack from south to north in three directions to capture Yudu, Anyuan, and Huichang. The Gan River coast will be temporarily defended because the Gan River is a natural boundary between southern and western Jiangxi. There are no large groups of armed bandits in western Jiangxi. The main force of the bandits is entirely on the east bank. In the future, it is only necessary to strictly guard the west bank of the Gan River to prevent the bandits from fleeing westward across the river, and the bandit crowds can be annihilated. As for the bandits' countermeasures, they plan to defend their stronghold on the east bank of the Gan River and hold it to the death. According to a report from the Political Training Office of a certain division in Ganzhou yesterday: (1) According to intelligence, the 7th and 5th Red Army corps have retreated from the Guangdong border back to Yudu and Xingguo, and their intentions are unclear. (2) The bandits on the east bank of the Gan River are digging trenches and continuing to fire guns into Ganzhou City. The 2nd Division's training regiment returned fire with mortars, and the bandits dispersed. They then fired on the city again, even more fiercely than before. After our army strafed them with machine guns, the situation eased somewhat. (3) After the Guangdong army captured Xinfeng, they are now launching a full-scale attack on the bandits. The defense of Nankang and Ganzhou has been handed over to the Jiangxi army. Chen Cheng's 18th Army, in addition to Zhou Yurous and Li Ming's two divisions that had already taken over the defense of Nankang Xincheng, the last division to depart, Luo Zhuoying's division, is also advancing from Suichuan to Ganzhou. Wang Maode's division Guo brigade, which originally advanced from Wan'an to Ganzhou, will return to Wan'an from Ganzhou to maintain Jiangxi's transportation from Ji'an to Ganzhou. (August 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e73">Secondary Flood in Various Counties of Guangdong <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Eastern River, Shenzhen, Shitanzhen a Vast Expanse of Water</p>
<p>Significant Flood Disaster in Xijiang, Sihui, and Sanshui Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the end of last month, the rains in Guangdong Province have not stopped. Guangzhou City has already suffered a massive flood. In recent days, heavy rains have fallen in various counties, causing the water levels in the East River and West River to rise again. Especially in the downstream areas of the East River and West River, the water cannot be discharged in time, and the counties have been flooded. It has been found that in the area where the East River flows into the sea, near the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, such as Shenzhen to Shitanzhen, all the rice paddies and houses have been flooded. Old houses have collapsed one after another, and even large trees several fathoms in height have been submerged more than halfway in the water. Looking from a high place, there is only a vast expanse of water. The residents of the disaster area are leading the old and supporting the young, escaping to the province, which is a pitiful sight. As for the West River, the water level from Fengchuan Lianjiangkou to Duchengtang has surged to more than two zhang. Sanshui County, located downstream, bears the brunt of the disaster. The water depth in Hekou Street exceeds seven feet, and small boats are used for transportation on the inner streets. Commerce has completely ceased. Residents of Hekou and Xinan have all fled to Sanshui County to escape the flood. Sihui County, located in the center of the West River, has recently been inundated with rainwater pouring down from Huaiji, Guangxi, making Sihui, a small place, the tail end of the water flow. As a result, most of the county's rice paddies have been flooded, and there is no hope of a harvest this autumn. Seven or eight out of ten houses outside the city have been flooded, and the city has become a watery domain. As for the embankments in various places, those that have been breached by the floodwaters in recent days include the Sanyi Embankment, which has a breach of more than fifty zhang, and the Cangqian Embankment, which has a breach of more than twenty zhang. Not a single tile remains in the villages within the embankments, and the villagers have been displaced. According to a telegram from the Magistrate of Sihui County, since July 31, the county seat has been experiencing continuous rain. Due to the low-lying terrain of the county, the water depth on the streets throughout the city exceeds eight or nine feet. All shops have temporarily suspended business, and the residents are extremely frightened. If one were to climb to the top of Yeli Hill in the county, one would see that all the fields and houses in the county seat area and the surrounding villages have been flooded, creating a vast expanse of water. The sound of gongs and alarms signaling the collapse of embankments in various villages and districts can be heard continuously. This is said to be the greatest disaster the county has experienced in ten years. After receiving the report, the provincial authorities ordered the River Management Association to send personnel to repair the embankments and ordered the Relief Section of the Department of Civil Affairs to allocate funds for relief.

<h3 id="e74">Third Day of Trial in the Noulens Case (Continued) <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Expert on Handwriting Identification States His Opinion Four Times</p>
<p>Noulens Deliberately Obstructs, Judge Displays Anger At this point, Mei Sheng presented three enlarged photographs, all of which were photographs of applications to the Electric Company for electricity. The judge asked whether the handwriting on these three photographs was the same as that on the letter to the Mei Feng Bank. Mei replied that the main text of these three photographs was not written by Noulens, but the handwriting of the signature and address was the same. He also said that when identifying the handwriting, he used another document as a reference, namely, the letter Noulens sent to the police chief on June 16th of last year. At this time, Noulens requested that the content of this letter be read aloud. Its content was "I now authorize Mr. Fei to collect 1,100 US dollars." Noulens said that it was not stated here that this 1,100 US dollars was mine. Mei Sheng said that the content of this letter did not matter because it was only used to identify the handwriting. Next, the reasons for identifying the handwriting on the three applications were stated as follows: (1) Application for electricity for Room 30, 49 Nanjing Road, C Section, signed Allison. The handwriting on this application is the same as that on the letter to the Mei Feng Bank. The direction of the characters is written to the right, the size of the characters is uneven, the top of the O is also open, the stroke on the left is lower than that on the right, and the handwriting is uneven. Judging from the structure of the characters, the capital A in Allison is exactly the same as the capital A in American on the letter to the Mei Feng Bank. The I is also the same. Also, the mathematical number 04 of 40 on the Mei Feng Bank is exactly the same as the 4 of 49 Nanjing Road. The way of writing the two characters NG is also the same. The stroke of the N is straight down, the lower part of the G is slanted down. Also, the strokes of the two characters RB are the same. Therefore, the handwriting on this application is the same as the handwriting on the letter to the Mei Feng Bank. (2) Application for electricity for 66 Hart Road, signed SHarrisns. The S is larger than the other characters, the same as the S on the letter to the Mei Feng Bank. The capital H is also the same, the way of writing the S is also the same, and the E is also smaller than the previous letter. The way of writing the N is the same as the way of writing it in the letter, so it is determined that the handwriting on this application is the same as the handwriting on the letter to the Mei Feng Bank. (3) Application for electricity for Room 4, 235 Sichuan Road, signed Nulens. The handwriting is the same as the handwriting on the letter to the police chief. The structure of the signature is the same. The way of writing the capital N is the same, but the force of the stroke of the N is heavier at the bottom, and the first curve is longer than the second curve. The top of the O is also open, the left is lower than the right, the three characters ENS are not connected to the L, the way of writing the S is also the same, and the bottom is open, which is the same as on the letter to the Mei Feng Bank.</p>
<p>The judge asked Noulens what he had to say about the reasons for the identification. (Noulens) I request that the judge ask the identifier when these photos were taken. The indictment says that there are more than seventy Chinese documents. The identifier only brought one today, and the evidence on the 18th has nothing to do with the Chinese situation. (Judge) Never mind whether it is relevant or not, you only say whether the identification is correct. (Noulens) Why are there more than seventy pieces of evidence, and the others have not been identified? (Judge) Do not talk nonsense. If you really have no criminal acts, why do you answer there when asked here? (Noulens) I request that the court pay attention to the fact that I said in the letter I wrote to the Mei Feng Bank that I authorized Mr. Fei to collect 400,000, and the money in Box C belongs to me. Here, the words "belongs to me" are present. (Judge) The question now is whether the identification is correct, nothing else matters. (Noulens) No answer. The judge then summoned Wang Delizeng.</p>
<p>(Judge) On March 15th of last year, you went to Room 30, Section C, 49 Nanjing Road, and you left three notes. (The judge presented the notes) (Wang) I request that the court read them to me, and read them loudly. (Judge) You have admitted them in both the Shanghai High Second Branch Court and the Supreme Court. Why do you still need to read them? Isn't this deliberately obstructing? At this point, Wang Delizeng still requested to read them. The judge rejected the request, saying that this was not a study of literature, but an identification of handwriting, so there was no need to read them. He handed them to Wang for personal review. Wang refused, and after a long argument, Wang finally took them for review. After reviewing them, he said that these were French notes, meaning "I have waited until half past twelve. I am now going to see the child and ask the doctor. If there are no changes, I will come again around 2:00 pm." At this time, the judge presented another document, which was a French letter typed in English, with words that Wang had changed. Wang again requested that the full text be read aloud. The judge rejected the request again. After another long argument, the translator read the full text aloud. After reading, Wang said that the Chinese court uses Chinese, so please read it in Chinese. The judge said that you do not understand Chinese, so reading it would be useless. If you want to read it in Chinese, then we will not need a translator in the future. Wang still insisted. The judge then read the four translations and asked if the words he changed were changed by him. Wang did not answer. At this time, Noulens suddenly requested that the English translation be read again. The judge was enraged, saying that he was deliberately obstructing and intentionally disrupting the proceedings. The audience was also angry and impatient. The judge asked Wang Delizeng again, but Wang still did not answer. The judge said that he was hurting himself and ordered the clerk to record it. He ordered Mei Sheng to express his opinion.</p>
<p>(Mei Sheng) This French letter was sent from Singapore on May 27th of last year. I compared it with the handwriting on the notes, and it is the same. There are also two photos here. (1) The O in the two handwritings starts from the lower left and falls down before starting again. (2) Both contain the word Avec. The A starts from the lower left, goes around in a circle, and then writes the location of the bay in the middle of the circle. The A and V are not connected, and the EC is written separately. (3) The way of writing the N is that the second curve is very sharp. (2) The R has two ways of writing, one round is square, and the other is sharp. (5) The format and arrangement of the characters are also exactly the same, so it is determined that they are written by the same person. (Judge) Wang Delizeng, what do you have to say? (Wang) I object to the police officers being used as identifiers. The court previously refused to allow foreign lawyers to appear in court. Why are you now looking for a British identifier? (Judge) This is your misunderstanding. The identifier is based on his knowledge and has nothing to do with the agency. The reason why lawyers cannot appear in court is stipulated by the lawyers' regulations. The identifier is not restricted by nationality. You have any comments on the identifier's opinion, if you do not answer, it is your own loss. (Noulens) Foreign lawyers without the right to jurisdiction can appear in Chinese courts. Although there is no legal provision for this, the Bar Association has expressed its opinion. We wanted to hire a lawyer from Germany to handle the case, but the Chinese embassy refused to issue a passport. (Judge) What is the basis for your statement? (Noulens) Finally, I will submit a letter for review. At this point, the judge summoned Mei Sheng again and asked if there was any other evidence. Mei Sheng expressed his opinion on the identification of the handwriting on the order form for Noulens's custom-made suit at a Western clothing store, but said that this form did not have an enlarged photograph, but the handwriting was indeed the same. The reasons were (1) The Alison signed on the electricity application for 49 Nanjing Road is the same as the Alison signed on this order form. (2) Each character is not connected. (3) The two characters AI are particularly obvious, and the VR are particularly tall. (4) The capital MR is also the same. (5) The two characters ON are also exactly the same. At this point, the judge ordered Mei Sheng to sign and swear again and ordered him to prepare an identification report to be submitted to the court. Mei Sheng said that he could submit it in two or three days. The previously read transcripts and all eight enlarged photographs, six about Noulens and two about Wang Delizeng, were all stored in the case file. The judge ordered the defendants to be taken back into custody and scheduled the court to reconvene for further trial at 1:00 pm on the 15th. The court adjourned in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e75">19th Route Army Attacks Tingzhou in Three Routes <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Fang Shengtao Goes to Quanzhou to Meet Cai Tingkai</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Cai Tingkai, the commander of the 19th Army currently stationed in Zhangzhou, received a telegram from He Yingqin, the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in the three provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, stating that after Xinfeng was recovered by the Guangdong army, the bandits from the pseudo-First and Fourth Front Armies who had occupied the area had fled to Huichang via Anyuan. The various armies of our bandit suppression are actively taking a surrounding posture and launching a fierce attack. The remnant bandits between Xinfeng and Xingguo will soon be wiped out. However, according to intelligence, Zhu De himself has secretly gone from Huichang to Ruijin. The Red Bandit's pseudo-organization and a large amount of grain and supplies have been moved to that place, which seems to indicate that they intend to flee to Fujian again. You must lead the various units on the front line to quickly cross Liancheng, Longyan, and Shanghang to attack Changting, in order to cut off the bandits' retreat and eliminate the scattered bandits in various places. After receiving the telegram, Commander Cai divided his troops into three routes and ordered Shen Guanghan's unit, currently stationed in Nanjing, to attack the front of Changting via Longyan. Qu Shounian's unit, stationed in Yongding, was ordered to move to Shanghang to attack the left flank of Changting. The newly formed Second Division of Lu Xingbang, stationed in Yong'an, was ordered to attack the right flank of Changting from Liancheng. All were given deadlines for arrival, so that the three routes could launch a general attack simultaneously.</p>
<p>Fang Shengtao, the acting chairman of the provincial government, felt it necessary to discuss the pacification of western and southern Fujian, as well as the defense areas and reorganization issues of the two brigades of Chen Guohui and Chen WeiYuan, currently stationed in Yongchun, Anxi, Putian and Xianyou, with Cai Tingkai in person. On the 2nd, he took a boat to Fuqing with Lin Zhiyuan, a member of the provincial government, and transferred to a long-distance bus via Xinghua to Quanzhou. He also telegraphed Zhangzhou to invite Cai to Quanzhou for talks and to inspect the garrison troops along the way. Fang and Lin arrived in Xianyou on the 4th, where Chen Guohui and Chen Weiyuan both arrived to welcome them and discuss military affairs, waiting for Commander Cai's reply before deciding on their next course of action.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Jiaoji Railway Redemption Plan <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Jiaoji Railway Bureau Has Drafted a Plan</p>
<p>Past Years' Surplus is Enough to Cover Japanese Debt Qingdao Dispatch: It has been ten years since the Jiaoji Railway was taken over, but the redemption period is only five years away. However, the Chinese people are not prepared for all the redemption matters. When the road was first taken over, the organizers established the Jiaoji Railway Co., Ltd. Preparatory Office, specializing in soliciting shares as a preparation for redemption. At that time, the National Government issued an order to all agencies in Beijing and abroad, deducting 2% of the monthly salary of those with a monthly salary of more than 100 yuan as a redemption savings fund. The handling of the matter could not be said to be lukewarm. Later, due to repeated changes in the political situation and the outbreak of internal wars, the people were unable to even provide for their own livelihoods, and this plan was abolished invisibly. Before long, the Chinese people had become indifferent to this matter. At the end of last month, when the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Inspection Group was in Qingdao, it attached great importance to the issue of redeeming the Jiaoji Railway and had a discussion with the Jiaoji Railway authorities. According to Cui Shijie, a member of the Jiaoji Railway Bureau, the Jiaoji Railway is fully responsible for the redemption issue, but can only contribute opinions for the authorities to adopt. All detailed plans must be jointly planned by the Ministry of Railways and the people of the whole country. There are only five years left until the redemption period. If we do not plan for the repayment early, how can we prevent the Japanese from coveting it? Although the railway's business has been affected by domestic wars over the years, its annual income, in addition to paying Japanese interest, still has a surplus. Although there is no accurate estimate of the railway's assets, the total value is no less than 80 million yuan, which is more than enough to repay the Japanese debt. The railway has drafted two specific plans and submitted them to the Ministry of Railways for review. Before these plans are approved, they cannot be announced due to international credibility. It is hoped that the redemption can be implemented within the time limit to maintain international credit. It is hoped that the Chinese people will work together to make the redemption easier. As for the acquisition of the commercial light railway in Boshan, a request has been submitted to the ministry for instructions. Once the ministry's order arrives, the railway can be taken over. According to another message, the redemption plan drafted by the Jiaoji Railway is (1) The Jiaoji Railway will issue a certain amount of public bonds, with the railway's assets as collateral, as a redemption preparation. (1) Solicit investment from all walks of life, and after the road is redeemed, it will be completely owned by the people. (August 10)</p>

<p>The Truth Behind a Bizarre Murder Case is Fully Revealed Wang, the wife of Gu Afu, a villager in Nanqian Village, the 11th district (Nanyan City) of the county, suddenly died in the river while passing through the Sushe Bridge area on the 20th of last month. Subsequently, the family of the deceased accused Zhu Genquan of beating Wang to death and abandoning her body in the river. Zhu Genquan surrendered himself to the authorities. The procuratorate scraped the bones of the corpse for examination, and it was determined that she had died by falling into the river. It is now learned that the case was actually caused by Hua Zhongliang (nicknamed "Touching Wall Ghost"), a local thug in the village. It turned out that when Gu Wang was passing by the door of Zhu Genquan's house in the Sushe Bridge area, she did fall into the river while washing peaches. At that time, Zhu Genquan even went into the river to rescue her, but she died due to excessive water intake and suffocation. After hearing the news, Hua Zhongliang, seeing an opportunity, immediately ordered Zhang Sannan's father, the head of the village, to extort 40 yuan from Zhu. Zhu refused outright because he was unwilling to be wronged. Hua, feeling humiliated, instigated Wang Guanshun, the deceased's brother, to file a petition in court for an autopsy. Now that the truth has been revealed, the procuratorate has telegraphed the Seventh Branch of the Township Public Security Bureau to arrest Hua and bring him to justice. Director Hui of the branch has received the telegram and has arrested Hua to await transfer to the court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Wu Jiangbo, in Zhangxiang Lane, the villagers Zhang Liangui and his wife usually work outside, leaving only one daughter at home to guard the door. The daughter, named Renxian, is only 18 years old and has excellent looks, but she is of good character and does not indulge in modern habits. She is also diligent in her work, so her parents love her very much. Unexpectedly, A Mao, the daughter of Wang Sangen, suddenly ridiculed Renxian in public the day before yesterday, using veiled language to imply that she had committed adultery, which led to an argument. Wang Sangen and his son Nansheng initially joined in the abuse, and then resorted to violence, severely beating Renxian. After being beaten, Renxian went to her grandmother's house to complain because her parents were out, but her grandmother was bedridden and unable to speak out for her niece. In anger, Renxian felt that she had no one to turn to and hanged herself in secret at 5 p.m. that day. By the time she was discovered, she had already passed away. After hearing the news, Liangui and his wife rushed back overnight and mourned over the body. They have now come to the city to report to the county court for an autopsy.</p>

<p>Various Townships in the Third District Report Famine This Spring in Wu County, rain has been a disaster, and after entering summer, there has been a prolonged drought with no rain for two months, causing ditches and ponds to dry up, the land to crack, and the rice seedlings to wither. The autumn harvest has been declared hopeless. In the past two or three days, more than ten townships and towns in the Third District, including Dongqiu, Shiwan, Anning, Lucheng, and Anjiashe, have reported famine to the county and requested that personnel be sent to inspect the situation and find ways to provide relief. Furthermore, there was a slight rainfall the day before yesterday. According to the farmers, the lower-lying fields can still be salvaged, but the higher-lying fields are like pouring a cup of water on a cart of burning firewood, which is still of no avail. Reactionary Criminals Sent to the High Court for Interrogation Zhang Zi'an and Huang Xuezhou, the criminals involved in the reactionary fraud case in Donghenglin, Wu County, surrendered to the Procuratorate of the Court at about 8 a.m. on the 13th for interrogation. After a court hearing, at about 12 p.m., Chief Prosecutor Yang sent police to escort the entire file, along with the two criminals and three other accomplices in custody, including Huang Sheng, to the Suzhou High Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Chamber of Commerce Resolves to Resist Enemy Goods After the establishment of the Jiangyin Branch of the Blood Soul Elimination of Traitors Group, it has sent letters to various treacherous merchants, setting a deadline for eliminating enemy goods. On the 12th, the County Chamber of Commerce held a special standing meeting to discuss (1) the case of Tiansheng Yarn Company, requesting the dispatch of personnel for inspection. It was decided that we should resist with conscience and pay extra attention. The request to send personnel for inspection should be unnecessary. (2) This Chamber has heard that enemy goods from Shanghai are being secretly transported inland. This Chamber severely warns all merchants to unanimously refuse to sell them. Furthermore, the Silk and Cloth Trade Association stated that Yuchangxiang and Yongtaichang have become wary since receiving warnings from the Blood Soul Group. On the 12th, the association held a meeting to inform all colleagues that they should be determined never to import enemy goods again. If private imports are discovered, they will be severely punished.</p>

<p>County Issues Tax-Backed Loan Certificates Worth 100,000 Yuan Due to Nantong's local financial difficulties, the county government, in order to alleviate the urgent situation, proposed to the county administrative meeting to issue county tax-backed loan certificates, following the example of the provincial government's method of issuing grain transport loan certificates. On the 13th, it was resolved to issue a total of 100,000 yuan, which will not be circulated in the same way as the loan certificates issued by the Property Management Office. The face value of the certificates will be divided into 10 yuan and 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Eastern Township Bandit Returned to Military Law for Interrogation The Nantong County Government arrested Pan Lanfang, a bandit from Eastern Township, who confessed to arson, robbery, and murder. He was sentenced to death and reported to the provincial government for approval. The provincial government reviewed the case and determined that the bandit was a deserter and should be returned to the military for interrogation in accordance with military law.</p>

<p>Yu Dabianzi Shot Dead While Attempting to Escape Yu Dabianzi, a notorious bandit, committed numerous crimes of kidnapping and looting in the six counties of Huzhou and had been wanted by the provincial government. In June of this year, he was arrested by the Seventh Company of the Security Team stationed in Lijiaxiang at Tiger Cave and sent to the Second Regiment Headquarters in this city for investigation. Because Yu confessed that he had many accomplices hiding near Lijiaxiang, Weixing, and was willing to lead the capture, the regiment headquarters ordered Lu, the company commander of the Seventh Company, to send a team to take Yu back by Huzhou-Changxing bus on the 11th of this month. They stayed temporarily at the company headquarters. At about 4 a.m. the next morning, just as they were about to set off to capture the bandits, Yu suddenly tried to escape. Company Commander Lu immediately ordered the soldiers to shoot Yu dead. He also reported the circumstances to the regiment headquarters for approval.</p>

<p>Major Robbery Occurs Outside Jiskan Gate Shengkang Money Shop in Shaoxing Xinhe Lane had 25,000 yuan in banknotes, which were sent to Hangzhou by Wang on the 12th to withdraw from Yingfeng Money Shop. He carried the money with him. The robbers learned of this and followed him. When they arrived at Xixing, they pulled out a pistol and asked Wang if he was returning to Shaoxing. Wang replied that he was returning to Shaoxing by bus. The robbers said that they also needed to go to Shaoxing and forced him to hire a boat to return to Shaoxing together. When they arrived outside Jishan Gate, the robbers ordered the boat to stop, robbed Wang of 25,000 yuan in banknotes, and went ashore towards Yuling. Before leaving, they fired a pistol at Wang's calf, saying that he could use it for disaster relief. The money shop has reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau and requested them to pursue the robbers. Wang has been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Suicide Due to Economic Oppression Lu Jingchu, a resident of Zhao Jiawu, a place in the southern countryside of Xiaoshan, was formerly a foreman at a silk mill in Shanghai. Since the Shanghai war this spring, the silk mill has been closed due to the impact, and he lost his job and returned home. Starting last month, his wife fell ill and his son died, making a living difficult. This time, he himself contracted typhoid fever and had no money for treatment, so he cut his throat with a razor to commit suicide in the middle of the night on the 12th. When the neighbors heard the sound and went to rescue him, his throat had already been severed, and he died on the spot.</p>
<p>Bandits Rob in Broad Daylight at Sheqian on the Border of Shaoxing and Xiaoshan There is a place called Sheqian on the border of Xiaoshan and Linpu Yiqiao. There are people of good and bad character traveling on the road every day. On the afternoon of the 11th, two cloth peddlers were stopped by five bandits speaking with mixed accents, who robbed them of 20 yuan in silver dollars and 35 cents in small silver coins. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 12th, two bandits on the main road from Sheqian to Xiaoshan also stopped a dried bamboo shoot peddler and robbed him of all his possessions: five silver dollars and more than ten cents in small silver coins.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Special Feature <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Opinions on the National Sports Conference (3) Lu Pei (9) "Promote universal sports, not only focus on athlete competitions, but also stipulate standard scores and promulgate physical education performance examination methods." The purpose of physical education is not to serve a very small number of outstanding talents, but to promote the health of everyone, indirectly improve their intelligence and morality, and assist their academic studies and the progress of their productivity. In addition to athlete competitions, group competitions should be added. For students of a certain level and age, gender should also be differentiated to stipulate a passing standard, so that the results can be made public, and they can also test themselves, arousing their psychology of practicing at any time and striving upward.</p>
<p>(10) "Stipulate the qualifications of amateur athletes." The qualifications of amateur athletes and the standard and performance examination methods in the previous article have never been fixed, or the results of the students of this school are accommodated to ensure that they all pass, or the methods of foreign countries are adopted too objectively. In my humble opinion, it seems better to change the word "amateur" to "voluntary," and use the qualifications of amateur athletes of the Hong Kong ball club as a blueprint and slightly modify it.</p>
<p>(11) (1) Add two hours of physical theory per week to all levels of normal schools. The content includes the principles of physical education, administrative management, and physical examination methods. A physical education teacher must have the perseverance of a soldier, the attitude of an educator, the responsibility of a doctor, the mind of an engineer, and the heart of a loving mother. If they know what is happening but do not know why, and blindly imitate new things, they will become physical education craftsmen. Therefore, they must study physical education subjects and be familiar with various methods of organization, facilities, guidance, encouragement, training, and testing in order to avoid being ridiculed as physical education craftsmen. (11) (2) "Physical education funds for secondary and higher schools should be independent." When preparing budgets, all secondary schools should separate the physical education fees and the physical education fees collected from students and not use them for other purposes. The physical education director should plan the phased additions, repairs, and distribution of various competitions and sports meets.</p>
<p>(11) (3) "Secondary school students are strictly prohibited from getting married." The Ministry of Education should strictly order all secondary schools to suspend students who have the above situation, regardless of the reason, and not issue transfer certificates. It is best for the Ministry of Interior to order all public security bureaus to require all marriages to be registered a few days in advance and require a doctor's certificate to prove that the body is fully developed, and a lawyer's certificate to prove their true age, name, address, and occupation in order to have legal effect.</p>
<p>(11) (4) The traditional class system should be abolished for physical education training. Physical education training should be divided into physical fitness, physical energy, and physical strength, and should vary according to age and gender. It seems inappropriate to use male rules for women's sports. In addition to group general training, special training should also be added to correct defects and promote balanced development. If the standard is based on the level of Chinese, English, arithmetic, etc., it will be like scratching an itch from outside a boot, and there will never be universal and balanced development.</p>
<p>(11) (5) Strictly prohibit women from wearing strange and enchanting clothes that hinder their physiology. Women are strictly prohibited from wearing corsets, perming their hair, wearing stiff collars, shoes with too high heels, and all clothing that is unhygienic and harmful to public morals. Female students should all wear short clothes and short skirts at school. However, this article cannot rely solely on official documents and should be vigorously promoted by the education community and lead by example to achieve complementary results. On the one hand, the Ministry of Interior should order local administrative and public security agencies to strictly stipulate punishment regulations. (11) (6) Increase the salary of physical education teachers. The salary of the physical education director should be equal to that of the academic affairs director. Physical education teachers should be treated the same as other liberal arts teachers. Now, not all schools in Jiangsu Province are uniform, and some physical education class hours have not been followed as stipulated by the Ministry, which should be corrected. Those who are old and have made considerable achievements should be given retirement benefits. Those who become disabled due to official duties should be given pensions or consolation money. Those who want to study abroad or focus on research to seek further studies or have inventions should be given bonuses. (11) (7) All schools should uniformly add a physical education director. Except for students under 100, there should be one physical education director and several teachers or instructors to manage all physical education matters in the school. To achieve the purpose of Article 14 above, a physical education director is even more indispensable. If so, the school sports field should be large and have more equipment, and teachers must also be increased. Although the cost is higher, the benefits to education and school spirit are great and definitely not a waste. Moreover, even if there are many teachers, the school expenses can also be saved by having them concurrently serve as life guidance or administrative duties. (End)</p>

<p>Retained for the Third Time Double won by Chinese with a Clean Sweep of Three Games Another Two Singles Groups Canceled The third Rotary Cup International Tennis Tournament, which caused a sensation in the entire city, saw the Chinese team defeat Portugal in the first battle and then defeat Britain in the final, thus retaining the championship for the third consecutive year. Today, there are still two singles groups between China and Britain, but because the championship has been decided, the competition has been canceled.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Chinese Team Reigns Supreme for Three Years <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Rotary Cup began in 1930 and was donated by the Shanghai Rotary Club to be hosted by the China National Sports Association for the Shanghai International Tennis Championship. For a time, people came from all directions, and the wind and clouds stirred. The championship for the first and second years was won by China. This is the third year, and China is once again seen continuing to reign supreme, which is enough to be called worthy.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Good Men Achieve Victory <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Six Wins in Six Battles</p>
<p>This time, the Chinese team was represented by Lin Baohua, Jiang Daozhang, Zheng Zhaojia, and Yu Tianguang. Lin and Zheng were responsible for singles, and Lin and Jiang teamed up for doubles. Since the start of the competition, they have won every battle and have been invincible. They have fought to this day and returned in triumph. The results of each battle are as follows:</p>

<p>Three Straight Sets</p>
<p>Too Gloomy In the first set, both sides started, and the Chinese Lin Baohua and Jiang Daozhang shot and intercepted as they pleased. Although the British had a world-renowned general, Whit, and Turner, who was more than steady, the difference was still obvious. In the third game, Whit's rapid serves and Turner's effective interceptions finally won back this game. Other than that, Lin and Jiang kept pressing forward and swallowed everything in one breath. As a result, they won 6-1.</p>

<p>Sudden Rise In the second set, there was a sudden unexpected discovery. The so-called "gloomy" British team clearly rose suddenly and stood against the Chinese team. At the beginning of the battle, the Chinese team lost two consecutive games. Although they soon won them back, the situation turned into a balanced one. 3-3, 4-4, and up to 6-6, 8-8. The Chinese team took the lead every time, but it was difficult to connect in one breath. In the 17th game, Jiang served and won another game. When it came to Whit, Lin's two exquisite shots won a 10-6 victory.</p>
<p>Perfect Ending In the third set, the Chinese Lin and Jiang attacked Turner together, winning all the consecutive points, and winning the first game. In the second game, Whit's powerful serves won back. In the third game, the Chinese team first failed, then recovered, and finally suffered another setback. In the fourth game, Whit's serves repeatedly resulted in self-inflicted losses. From the fifth to the eighth games, each team won, and the situation was equal. In the ninth game, the Chinese team took a big advantage. In the tenth game, Lin and Jiang performed excellently, and the ending was perfect. The championship belonged to us. The Chinese team won the third set with a score of 6-4. The referee was Zhou Jiaqi.</p>

<p>As for the local administration, there is no uniform method in the education halls and bureaus of each province and city. Some have physical education instructors, some have public sports field directors, some have physical education committees, and recently some have physical education supervisors. Even those without physical education administrative organizations are still in the majority. Since the titles of administrative personnel are not the same, the duties they perform are also inconsistent, making it difficult to achieve common goals. As for those local administrative agencies that have no physical education administrative organization, it can be seen that they do not fundamentally seek the development of physical education. Therefore, it is difficult to standardize.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Education Hall <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>In order to ensure administrative organization and actual administrative effectiveness, the education halls and bureaus of each province and city should set up at least one physical education supervisor to study, inspect, and urge the implementation of physical education. Whether to set up a physical education committee should be considered based on the local situation. The original public sports field directors will still remain in their posts. Those without public sports fields should find ways to add them. The committee and supervisor system in Hebei Province and the public sports field system in Shandong and Jiangsu Provinces can all be adopted by other provinces. The organization of the education halls and bureaus in each province and city is different. Here is a system table based on the general halls and bureaus:</p>
<p>As for the duties of the supervisor, in addition to inspecting and guiding the physical education of schools at all levels, he should perform the following duties: (1) Formulate the physical education plan for the entire province (2) Prepare the physical education administrative budget for the entire province (3) Review the physical education budgets of all schools in the province (4) Stipulate the detailed physical education curriculum for the entire province and urge its experimentation and implementation (5) Review physical education organizations that request registration and filing (6) Study and improve the methods of physical education in the entire province (7) Handle physical education performance evaluation matters for the entire province. At present, the physical education situation in each province is mostly simple and crude, and each has its own special circumstances and difficulties. The steps of the physical education supervisor's work must be scientific, starting from investigating and inspecting the actual situation in various places, and then formulating the goals and plans for implementation gradually. It is absolutely forbidden to act rashly and mislead people, and it is even more forbidden to have no plan, changing orders in the morning and evening, causing those who are responsible for physical education to be at a loss.</p>
<h3 id="e100">(2) Equipment <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The economic situation in our country is so low, and the physical education equipment of schools at all levels and public sports is extremely simple and crude. It is extremely difficult to seek appropriate equipment. The equipment standards set this time are actually the lowest standards from the perspective of physical education. However, in terms of national conditions, it seems too idealistic. However, if we want to develop physical education, poor equipment is the biggest obstacle. If those who preside over education administration can understand the importance of physical education and the necessity of its equipment and strive to expand it, it may not be impossible. Therefore, it is better to focus on ideals as the goal of efforts in the education and sports communities, rather than being too accommodating to reality and making physical education equipment equal to zero. The equipment that each level of school and public sports field should have is listed below. The above-listed fields are the minimum for elementary schools with less than 100 students. For elementary schools with more than 100 students, each 100 students should be doubled, and those with less than 50 students can be added by half. Elementary schools that only have lower grades and rural elementary schools that cannot prepare fields according to the above principles under special circumstances should use 100 square feet of playground space for each student as the minimum standard. (2) Fixed Equipment Organ or gramophone One Horizontal bar Two Giant steps One Swing One Slide One Seesaw One High jump stand (can be used as a jump rope stand) Two pairs Basketball hoop Two pairs (one pair for men and one pair for women) Volleyball net One pair or two pairs Mats (approximately 150 square feet) Two The above-listed fixed equipment is the minimum for elementary schools with less than 100 students. For elementary schools with more than 100 students, each 100 students should be doubled, and those with less than 50 students can be added by half. (3) Consumable Equipment Basketball net Two pairs Volleyball net Two Ball bats Four Ball paddles Two pairs Basketball Three Volleyball Three Ball Six Ball Two Medicine balls Four (Weight must be increased) Lime Two hundred catties Air pump Two Thin rope Four hundred feet Lime line drawing pot Two The above-listed consumable equipment is the minimum standard for each semester for elementary schools with less than 100 students. For elementary schools with more than 100 students, each 100 students should be doubled, and those with less than 50 students can be added by half.</p>

<p>The participants in this conference are: 1. School sports directors, 2. Provincial and municipal sports representatives, 3. Principals of physical education colleges, 4. Directors of national arts halls, 5. Sports experts, 6. Representatives of agencies, 7. Responsible officials (Ministry of Education). The 13th was the first day of registration for the conference, and the number of registered people was not large. The number of participating members and the number of proposals submitted by the 12th have been recorded in the newspapers. On the 13th, the Hong Kong Sports Association telegraphed that it would send Zhao Qianghua to attend. Several other proposals have also been submitted. The association, after checking the provisions of Article 2, Item 7 of the conference regulations (one councilor should be added to attend after the regulations are revised), has already requested the Ministry of Education to appoint Councilor Yang Fang as a member of the National Sports Conference on the 13th (the revised text of Article 2, Item 7 of the regulations is the Minister, Vice Minister, and one Councilor of the Ministry of Education, as well as the directors and section chiefs of each responsible department).</p>

<p>In addition, there are more than 20 people from the Ministry of Education's secretariat, section chiefs, and section members who are serving as conference staff (Conference secretaries Wu Yan, Zhong Lingxiu, Daily Editor-in-Chief Yi Keyi, General Manager Guo Lianfeng, Document Section staff Gu Wenjie, Weng Zhida, Huang Longxian, Gao Hongtu, Huang Wenqi, Jin Guisun, Wang Gen, He Boli, Wang, Reception Section staff Shi Wei, Zhang Yuanxun, Tu Gang, Dai Ce fan, Jia Guoren, Xie Zhuozi, Shu Chushi, Wei Xuezhi, Zhu Shusen, Zou Fengji). A letter was sent to the Ministry of Finance requesting that it select and send a representative to attend, and it was hoped that the representative's name and resume would be sent to the meeting in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e104">(4) Proposal Group Review Undetermined <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The classification of proposals (previously divided into twenty categories) and the issue of group review (seven groups) have not yet been fully determined. For example, in grouping, if we consider the first school sports organization from the vertical perspective of the educational system, the so-called university, middle school, and primary school can be consistent. However, from the horizontal perspective, there are differences in school sports facilities, curriculum materials, teachers, etc., which must be studied separately. Whether the future approach will be to have each major group include several categories for combined review, or to add more groups because the seven groups cannot be summarized, will depend on the discussion at the general meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e105">(5) Yesterday, Nineteen Members Arrived <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>

<p>Mr. Tang said, "Even so, your production is too slow compared to modern machine production and will eventually be eliminated. If you want not to be eliminated, you must adopt Fordism - 'one person, one action'." Mr. Zhu said, "Why be fast? Because production is faster than people, and prices are cheaper than people, you can seize the market from people. This is purely the expression of individual competition in machine construction. If you want production to be faster and faster, you must divide the work finer and finer until you reach 'one person, one action'. I think reversing Ford's words would better describe his spirit. The result of Fordism is 'one action, one person'. One person, all day long, all year round, all their life doing this one monotonous action. If they don't end up half-dead, they will inevitably develop mental illness. So, Fordism begins with one person doing one action and ends with one action destroying one person. It turns good people into lunatics and the world into hell. You ask Ford himself to work in a car factory according to the 'one person, one action' method for a year and a half. See if he is willing to do it again, see if he is willing to call his children to do it, and see if he is still willing to implement this 'one person, one action' principle." Mr. Tang said, "You seem to be against machines, don't you?" Mr. Zhu said, "I am not against machines, but I think our concept of machines needs a fundamental change. The predecessors who made machines put all their eyes on production! The faster and more the production, the better the machine can be considered perfect. He completely ignored the workers who used the machines. In the future, scientific inventions of machines should shift their gaze to the workers. We want to create machines for people, not machines for slaves - we want to create machines that benefit people, not machines that harm people - we want to create machines that nourish people, not machines that destroy people. Our purpose is to create all kinds of machines so that the people who use them can enjoy their work. In the future world, only this new machine with human life at its center can exist. All machines that enslave, harm, and destroy people must be smashed to pieces and placed in the stove to recreate that new machine with human life at its center. This new machine with human life at its center has no extravagant hope; it does not want to turn the world into paradise; it will not turn the world into hell; its mission is to turn an unreasonable world into a reasonable human world. This is the new machine doctrine we want to realize."</p>

<p>Wang's Resignation is Firm, but He Has Agreed to Go to Beijing Within Days</p>
<p>He, Wu, Zhu, and Others Returned to Beijing by Night Train Last Night to Report</p>
<p>Wang and Zhang Decided to Go Together and Will Discuss Successor Candidates</p>
<p>The Political Situation Took a Sharp Turn and Can Be Fully Resolved This Week</p>
<p>Regarding the resignation of Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, due to the ineffectiveness of continuous retention efforts from various parties, the political situation is extremely somber. The central government previously sent Central Committee member Wu Zhihui to Hankou to discuss everything with Chiang Kai-shek. Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, Mr. Wu arrived in Shanghai by plane from Hankou and immediately went to visit Song Ziwen and others to exchange opinions. He then wired Wang's residence and arranged a meeting with Wang. Yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock, Wu Zhihui, Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Zhu Jiahua, and others went to Wang's residence on Pushi Road. Wang was already there as agreed. The two sides talked for more than an hour before Wu, Song, He, and others excused themselves and left. According to He Yingqin, after three meetings with Wang, he had achieved satisfactory results. Wang had agreed to return to Beijing within days, and the political situation could be restored to stability. Last night at 11 o'clock, He Yingqin, Wu Zhihui, Zhu Peide, Zhu Jiahua, Zeng Zhongming, and others took the night train back to Beijing to report the results of their negotiations in Shanghai to the central government. According to Zeng Zhongming, Wang and Zhang resigned together, and the central government will approve both. Currently, only the issue of successor candidates remains. In any case, it can be fully resolved by the middle of next week. The political situation has taken a sharp turn for the better. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e119">Wu Arrived in Shanghai by Plane <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui of the central government previously went to Hankou from Beijing to visit Chiang Kai-shek to discuss the solution to the political situation. He has now achieved considerable results and arrived in Shanghai by plane from Hankou at 3 PM yesterday. After disembarking, he immediately went to Song's residence on Qi Qi Road to visit Song Ziwen and report Chiang's views. Soon after, Zhu Peide, He Yingqin, and Zhu Jiahua arrived at Song's residence one after another and discussed with Mr. Wu for a long time. They then wired Wang's residence and arranged a meeting with Wang. Wang agreed to wait at his residence at 5 o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Final Meeting at Wang's Residence <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock, Wu Zhihui, Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Zhu Jiahua, and others went to Wang's residence on Pushi Road. Wang Jingwei personally received them. First, Wu stated Chiang's intentions, still hoping that Wang would return to Beijing soon to resume his duties. As for Zhang Xueliang's resignation, the central government decided to approve it. Wang immediately stated that he would never return to the position of President of the Executive Yuan, but he would work hard at other positions. Then, Song, He, Zhu, and others repeatedly persuaded him, but Wang finally refused. As a result, Song, He, and others drafted a compromise plan, asking Wang to return to Beijing within days to stabilize the political situation. At the same time, the central government would approve his resignation and appoint him to another important position. Only then did Wang agree. The meeting lasted for an hour and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e121">He and Wu Returned to Beijing Together <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>He Yingqin, Wu Zhihui, Zhu Peide, Zhu Jiahua, and others, believing that there had been considerable results in persuading Wang, took the night train back to Beijing at 11 o'clock last night to attend this morning's Central Standing Committee discussion meeting to report the results of their negotiations in Shanghai and discuss Zhang Xueliang's resignation. According to the Central News Agency, today's Central Standing Committee discussion meeting will be changed to a standing committee meeting to make a resolution on the resignation of Zhang Xueliang, the Director of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters.</p>
<h3 id="e122">He's Statement <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper's reporter visited He Yingqin last night. According to him, he had a draft statement and handed it over to the Central News Agency for publication. The original text is recorded as follows: "Yesterday afternoon, Deputy President of the Yuan Song Ziwen, Minister He Yingqin, Director Zhu Peide, Minister Zhu Jiahua, and Committee Member Wu Zhihui visited President Wang and talked for a long time. After Song and others excused themselves and left, reporters from the Central News Agency inquired about the progress of retaining President Wang. Minister He replied as follows: President Wang's intention to resign is still firm, but he has agreed to go to Beijing in person within days to report the reasons for his resignation to the Central Party Headquarters. Although colleagues have not yet been able to dispel President Wang's intention to resign, President Wang values national affairs and has agreed to go to Beijing within days. The political situation can be restored to stability. This is something that can be comforting to the people of the country."</p>

<p>At around 10:40 last night, He Yingqin had already boarded the train. Song Ziwen hurriedly sent someone with an important letter in his own handwriting to the station to hand it to He to take to Beijing. It is said that the content was about Song's personal opinions on successor candidates.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Zeng Zhongming's Conversation <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper's reporter spoke with Railway Minister Zeng Zhongming on the train last night. Zeng also went to Beijing by night train last night. According to Zeng, "Today (i.e., yesterday), Mr. Wu Zhihui, on the orders of Chiang, came to Shanghai to see Wang. Chiang still firmly urged Wang to resume his duties, but Wang's attitude was extremely firm and he refused to return to his post under any circumstances, but he indicated that he could work hard at other positions. The political situation has come to an end here. Minister He and others will return to Beijing tonight (i.e., last night) to attend tomorrow's (i.e., today's) Central Standing Committee discussion meeting. It is hoped that there will be considerable results regarding Wang's resignation and Zhang Xueliang's resignation. From my personal observation, the central government will approve the resignations of Wang and Zhang. What is being discussed now is the issue of successor candidates, but in any case, I firmly believe that it can be completely resolved by the middle of next week. The future of the political situation will be bright again."</p>

Our army sent a letter to Supervisor General Zhu Jiqing requesting assistance with military supplies. Recently, a separate letter was sent to General Zhu and Supervisor General Zhu Jiqing requesting assistance. The gentlemen of the Support Conference are so enthusiastic in their assistance that our army is deeply grateful. In addition, the first branch of the Nanjing Road Business Community United Association directly donated 1,000 yuan, which was entrusted to Mr. Wang Lianfang, a warm-hearted person from the association, to produce more than 700 sets of military uniforms at the Wang Shuntai Clothing Company. The company not only donated labor but also voluntarily donated 40 military trousers. The patriotic enthusiasm of the gentlemen of the association and the company is truly admirable. We are also grateful for the enthusiastic support of Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Zhongyu, Li Shengzhang, Tong Xinbai, Shi Shengtai, Liang Huaixian, and other relatives and friends.

The following resolutions were passed: (1) To form a committee, nominating the Ningbo, Shaoxing, Changzhou, Guangdong, Pudong, Chaozhou, All Zhejiang, Hebei, and Jiading nine hometown groups as committee members. The number of representatives from each hometown association is not limited. If major motions arise, another joint meeting of the hometown associations will be convened. (2) Each hometown group will petition the court to grant bail. (3) Each group will, to the extent of its time and ability, negotiate with reputable shops to act as guarantors. At that time, the Chaozhou Hometown Association took the lead in agreeing to provide fifty shop guarantees, their righteous indignation evident in their words. Further discussion of various methods of implementation was extensive. The meeting adjourned close to 7 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Investigation into the Fineness of Silver Coins by Expert Edward Kann <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Most groups advocate following the Third Year of the Republic Regulations.</p>
<p>However, the Third Year of the Republic Regulations were not effectively implemented. This time, the Central Bank convened a committee to study the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan. Based on the proposal of expert Edward Kann, the weight of the new coin was set at 7 qian and 9 li, and the fineness at 88% silver and 12% copper. This has been largely resolved and is pending official approval from the Ministry of Finance. Mr. Kann has been engaged in the financial sector in China for over twenty years and has conducted in-depth research on Chinese currency. His proposals are based on detailed and meticulous investigations. According to sources obtained by the New Voice Society, the basis of his investigations is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e134">The Fineness of Old Coins from the Late Qing Dynasty <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Since the Guangdong Provincial Mint began casting dragon dollars in the fifteenth year of the Guangxu reign, marking the start of China's own production of silver coins, various provinces successively followed suit. According to an investigation in the eighth year of the Republic, the total amount of old coins cast by various Chinese mints was 286,351,413 yuan. Their weight and fineness are as follows: (1) Guangdong: weight 7.245 Kuping taels, each yuan contains 6.540 taels of silver, fineness 899.60; (2) Hubei: weight 7.226, contains 6.530 taels of silver, fineness 900.10; (3) Jiangnan: weight 7.243, contains 6.538 taels of silver, fineness 899.50; (4) Beiyang Machine Bureau: weight 7.289, contains 6.386 taels of silver, fineness 890.00; (5) Beiyang Branch: weight 7.396, contains 6.582 taels of silver, fineness 888.90; (6) Fengtian Machine Bureau: weight 7.247, contains 6.207 taels of silver, fineness 843.50; (7) Fengtian Branch: weight 7.074, contains 5.959 taels of silver, fineness 843.50; (8) Eastern Three Provinces: weight 7.191, contains 6.400 taels of silver, fineness 889.50; (9) Jilin: weight 6.9880, contains 6.178 taels of silver, fineness 889.40; (10) Sichuan: weight 7.179, contains 6.437 taels of silver, fineness 886.80; (11) Anhui: weight 7.229, contains 6.477 taels of silver, fineness 887.20; (12) General Mint: weight 7.209, contains 6.521 taels of silver, fineness 900.30. In the second year of the Xuantong reign, the government was requested to issue a national currency law stipulating that the new currency unit be the yuan, commonly known as the Daqing silver coin. The master mold for this coin was cast by the Tianjin Mint and submitted to the Qing court for approval. Its weight was 7 qian and 2 fen Kuping taels, and its fineness was 900. From the third year of Xuantong, the Wuchang and Nanjing Mints began trial casting, expecting it to circulate in the winter of that year. However, the Wuchang Uprising occurred in October, and in a hurry, mostly mixed coins were used to pay salaries. Several years later, the Sichuan military government issued a new type of coin called the Dahan silver coin, which was one of the last types of currency of the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<h3 id="e135">The Third Year of the Republic Regulations Were Not Effectively Implemented <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Currently, commercial organizations in various provinces and cities advocate that the weight and fineness of future new silver coins should comply with the National Currency Regulations of the Third Year of the Republic. These regulations stipulated that the fineness should be 900/1000, weighing 7 qian and 2 fen Kuping taels, meaning that the pure silver content should weigh 6 qian and 4 fen and 8 li Kuping taels. In reality, these regulations were never effectively implemented. The casting of Yuan Shikai coins was closely related to the recall and recasting of 280 million yuan of dragon dollars at that time. The fineness of the dragon dollars was lower than that stipulated. If those with lower fineness were recast into those with higher fineness, the government would inevitably suffer losses. At that time, the treasury was in dire straits and unable to bear this loss, so it had to reduce the fineness of the Yuan Shikai coins to 890/1000. However, according to statistics from A. Tracey Woodward, the fineness of Yuan Shikai coins was as follows: (1) Coins from the Third Year of the Republic: weight 414.73 British grains, fineness 880; (2) Coins from the Eighth Year of the Republic: weight 413.37 British grains, fineness 880; (3) Coins from the Ninth Year of the Republic: weight 413.99 British grains, fineness 880; (4) Coins from the Tenth Year of the Republic: weight 414.66, fineness 880. By the thirteenth year of the Republic, the highest fineness of inferior Yuan Shikai coins discovered in the Anhui Mint and in Shanghai in the fourteenth year of the Republic was 823, and the lowest was only 744. Therefore, it is most appropriate and feasible to stipulate the fineness of new coins at 880, as stipulating it too high would inevitably repeat the failure of the Third Year of the Republic Regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Names of Mints in Various Provinces <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>According to Edward Kann's plan for the abolition of taels and adoption of the yuan, the biggest prerequisite is to ensure that the fineness, weight, form, and area of silver dollars across the country are completely uniform. Casting must be concentrated in one agency, so that all silver dollars in the country are exclusively made by the designated mint, which is currently the Central Mint in Shanghai. The locations of the mints in various provinces are as follows: (1) Nanjing Mint; (2) Qingjiangpu Mint, specializing in copper coins; (3) Hangzhou Mint, already closed; (4) Anqing Mint; (5) Fuzhou Mint; (6) Fujian Hongshanqiao Mint; (7) Fujian Mehe Mint; (8) Shaxian Mint; (9) Xiamen Mint; (10) Guangxi Nanning Mint; (11) Guangxi Wuzhou Mint; (12) Guilin Mint; (13) Guangzhou Mint; (14) Yunnan Mint; (15) Wuchang Mint; (16) Nanchang Mint; (17) Changsha Mint; (18) Chengdu Mint; (19) Chongqing Mint; (20) Xi'an Mint; (21) Lanzhou Mint; (22) Taiyuan Mint; (23) Jinan Mint; (24) Tianjin Mint; (25) Beiyang Mint; (26) Zhangjiakou Mint; (27) Shenyang Mint; (28) Jilin Mint; (29) Dihua Mint. The circumstances of the above mints, whether specializing in copper coins, silver coins, or both, varied, and most of them have already ceased casting.</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Shanghai Standard Silver Unit <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai business community's change in the unit of account to the Shanghai Kuping Tael, namely 98 Kuping Silver, started in the sixth year of Xianfeng, i.e., 1856. Before the sixth year of Xianfeng, the 'Benyang' (foreign dollar) was practically the only circulating silver coin in China, its influence spreading to Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other provinces. Exchange rates quoted by banks were also based on this. However, around the twentieth year of Daoguang, the minting of Benyang stopped, and the source gradually dried up. Soon, its price in various provinces and cities gradually increased, exceeding its silver value by about 20-30%. As a result, business was severely hampered. Therefore, the Shanghai business community changed the unit of account to the Shanghai Kuping Tael. It is said that in that year, when various Shanghai banks and commercial organizations switched to using the Shanghai Kuping Tael, the market price of Benyang happened to be equal to the Shanghai Kuping Tael. Therefore, only the unit name needed to be changed on the account books, while the numbers could remain the same. This is also an interesting story. Currently, the Benyang is no longer a circulating currency in China.</p>

<p>Edward Kann, drawing on his experience of over twenty years in the banking business in major commercial ports in China, wrote a book entitled "Theory of Chinese Currency," divided into three sections: gold, silver, and copper, with extremely detailed discussions. The book was translated by Cai Shoubai of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank and published by the Commercial Press, serving as the most complete reference book for studying Chinese currency systems and exchange rates.</p>

<p>Japanese Army and Police Cooperate in the Capture</p>
<p>Currently Detained at the Japanese Consulate General. According to reliable foreign sources, Korean revolutionary leader Kim Koo has been captured by the Japanese Navy in collaboration with Chinese police on Chongming Island and is currently detained at the Japanese Consulate General. Kim Koo's arrest took place several weeks ago. This newspaper's reporter heard about it earlier, but it has only now been confirmed from various sources. Kim Koo is the leader of the Korean independence movement. Since the bombing at Hongkou Park at the end of April, he has been even more closely watched by the Japanese military and political authorities. Later, Kim Koo, fearing the Japanese authorities' intense manhunt, left Shanghai and temporarily sought refuge in the countryside of Chongming. However, his hiding place was also discovered by the Japanese. Japanese Consul General Murai immediately notified the Chinese authorities, requesting cooperation in the capture. Japanese warships approached the vicinity of Chongming, and several marines were dispatched to land, working with local police, using swift and decisive methods to capture Kim Koo and escort him to the Japanese Consulate General for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Decides to Modify the Notification</p>
<p>Negotiations on the Shanghai International Settlement District Court Agreement will commence at the end of this year. The agreement is set to expire on March 31 of next year. The government believes that the content of the agreement is not fully autonomous and has decided to conduct revisions with the relevant countries. Details of the news are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e141">Notification to Six Countries <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The court agreement will expire on March 31 of next year (1933). According to personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Shanghai, the procedures on the part of the Ministry of Judicial Administration have been prepared after Minister Luo's inspection in Shanghai. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not have much procedure, only drafting notifications and preparing to send personnel for negotiation. Currently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared to notify relevant countries shortly, requesting them to send representatives to conduct negotiations. This negotiation must begin at the end of this year. The countries to be notified include Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil, following the old precedent of notifying them separately.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Points for Revision <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the points that should be revised in the subsequent negotiations, the principle is to strive to transform it into a judicial institution that is fully autonomous to our country. However, the key points are no more than (1) execution; (2) appointment and dismissal of judicial police; (3) appearance of foreign lawyers in court. According to the provision in the last section of Article 6 of the agreement regarding the power of appointment and dismissal, "The judicial police officers of the said courts shall be appointed by the President of the High Sub-Court after recommendation by the Municipal Council. The President of the High Court shall have the power to dismiss them for stated reasons, or the Municipal Council may terminate their employment with stated reasons." In addition, the section regarding consideration of the Yangjingbang Regulations stipulated in Article 2 of the agreement may also need to be revised.</p>
<h3 id="e143">History of the Agreement <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement Special District Court Agreement was a modification of the Provisional Court Agreement of the International Settlement, reorganized and established. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally notified the British, American, French, Dutch, Norwegian, and Brazilian ministers on May 8, 1929. On October 31, a response was received from the Dutch minister, Odencrantz, representing the relevant countries. On November 19, 1929, a meeting was formally held in Nanjing, and it was signed on February 27, 1930. It came into effect on April 1 of that year, with a validity period of three years. Upon expiration, it could be extended for three years with the consent of both parties. The entire agreement consists of ten articles and eight annexes. Both parties also appointed two permanent representatives in accordance with Article 9 of the agreement as responsible personnel for interpreting the agreement in case of issues. Now that the agreement has been proposed for revision by our side, it will expire on March 31 of next year.</p>

<p>After the workers of the British-owned buses in the International Settlement went on strike, the company refused to negotiate and implemented the hiring of new workers. The strike committee issued a mobilization order, expelling White Russians, leading to disturbances yesterday. Several White Russians were injured, and passengers were affected, with the situation being very serious. The police received orders to step up precautions. Details are as follows:</p>

<p>Based on the resolution of the mass meeting, the strike committee sent four worker representatives to the company on Kang Nao Road (Connaught Road) yesterday for direct negotiations, requesting: (1) reinstatement of those who were fired, and no more workers to be fired in the future; (2) a wage increase to forty yuan across the board, with an annual increase of three yuan thereafter, and wages to be paid during the strike period; (3) restoration of the copper coin bonus, issued according to the original standards; (4) uniform replacement of new cards, replaced every six months thereafter. Xiao Da, the factory's chief in charge of both factory and car affairs, refused to meet them, stating that the company had already announced the complete dismissal of those on strike, making negotiation impossible.</p>

<p>Company, in order to restore public bus services on various routes, Factory Director and Chief of Car Affairs Xiao Da specially dispatched Associate Pi Ya to directly recruit new workers from the China Vocational Introduction Agency. Now, after receiving a warning from the strike committee, the China Vocational Introduction Agency immediately stopped acting as an intermediary. Therefore, only twenty-five new workers were recruited. At 10 AM yesterday, the company specially dispatched a dedicated vehicle, driven by Associate Pi Ya, to Nanjing Road Bund to transport them to the company on Kang Nao Road. Along the way, Chinese and Western detectives from the police force provided protection with the vehicle to prevent incidents. Since yesterday afternoon, Associate Pi Ya has been personally training them. It is reported that the recruits are all fluent in Western languages, which shows how much unemployment there is in society at present.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in order to maintain transportation, the company continued to have ticket inspectors replace ticket sales, with fourteen buses running on Route 1, seven on Route 2, seven on Route 5, four on Route 6, twenty-four on Route 9, and special express buses. Detectives provided protection along the way. The strike committee believed that the company's refusal to negotiate and its strong attitude were unreasonable and allowed the striking workers to take direct action, issuing an order to expel White Russians who violated strike discipline. At the same time, a declaration was issued, notifying Chinese passengers to avoid accidental impacts. They considered that the operation of public buses would affect the future of the strike and implemented the work of stopping the buses. All members of the picket team were dispatched, leading to disturbances on various routes yesterday, with the situation being serious.</p>

<p>Yesterday, when a Route 6 bus drove to the intersection of Pingliang Road and Huasheng Road, it was surrounded by striking workers. The ticket seller, a Russian named Bi Baifu, was severely injured. At 11 AM, when a Route 6 bus drove to Ou Jia Road Bridge, striking workers filled soda bottles with strong acid and splashed it on the ticket seller, a Russian, who was immediately injured and fainted on the ground. A Mr. Liu, a passenger wearing a Western suit, had strong acid splashed on his eyes. A Mr. Mou, dressed in Chinese clothing, had strong acid splashed on the back of his head. At the same time, striking workers assaulted Russians on Route 1, Route 2, and Route 9 buses. Seven White Russians, including Bi Baifu, Liji Fu, Dakonuo Fu, and Yin Qi Yinji, were assaulted.

<p>Yesterday morning, Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Yingxing ordered the Inspection Department's Detective Team, together with the Fifth District Police Station, to send police detectives to the vicinity of the North Railway Station for strict precautions. The Inspection Department dispatched Inspector Fu Suren, and the Detective Team dispatched Detective Su Sheng, together with police detectives from the Fifth District, to conduct secret investigations armed. The Huishi Police Station and the Police Department of the International Settlement specially dispatched detectives to be stationed at Jielu, Haining Road, Kenenghai Road, and Aerjin Road, and to check pedestrians for precautionary purposes.</p>

<p>At 10:05 AM yesterday, detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau stationed for prevention purposes saw a Chinese man in Western clothing lingering on the platform of the former Songhu Railway Station on the east side of the North Railway Station, behaving suspiciously. They immediately ordered him to stop and checked his person, immediately confiscating various red and green leaflets and four small pamphlets for propaganda. He was arrested and taken to the Baoshan Road Fifth District Police Station. District Chief He Yiming, together with inspectors, interrogated him. He claimed to be named Cao Zhifan, from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, aged 18, and was an apprentice at the Kaiming Bookstore at the intersection of Sima Road and Shandong Road. He was immediately handed over to the General Bureau and transferred to the local court for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Second Report from Postal Workers Entering from the Liaoning District <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Lower-Level Employees Feel Extremely Distressed in Their Lives</p>
<p>Liu Ting Establishes an Office in Tianjin</p>
<p>The National Postal Association Will Raise Funds to Provide Relief. Since the postal service in Northeast China was blockaded, more than a thousand postal workers from Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have entered the pass so far. Apart from a small number who have been assigned to Shanghai, Beiping, Qingdao, Jinan, and other bureaus, the majority are concentrated in Tianjin. Among them, lower-level employees are particularly distressed. The National Postal Workers' General Association received a second submission yesterday from the Liaoning Postal Workers' Club's Tianjin Office, reporting in detail on the living conditions of postal workers entering the pass in Tianjin and the handling of reception matters. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e158">Liaoning Postal District <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Since the blockade, the number of employees who have withdrawn and entered the pass has reached more than a thousand to date. Apart from senior and experienced employees, lower-level employees such as messengers and laborers have limited salaries and travel expenses, and some have not received their salaries. After arriving in Tianjin, travel and accommodation expenses are high, and most laborers have exhausted their funds. Those who request relief from the office of the Employees Department every day are countless. The office believes that the laborers are motivated by righteousness</p>
<h3 id="e159">Risking Withdrawal <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Their actions are commendable, and their plight is pitiful. In both reason and sentiment, assistance should be provided, but the funds are limited, like a drop in the bucket, making it difficult to distribute evenly. However, we cannot bear to stand idly by. Fortunately, we have received assistance from the Tianjin Friendship Association and borrowed a property from the Eastern Society Bureau of the Beining Garden, with dozens of rooms. Although the tiles are broken and the walls are crumbling, presenting a dilapidated appearance, it is the only way to provide temporary relief for the helpless laborers, providing them with a place to shelter from the wind and rain. Further plans include: first, providing monetary assistance to laborers in financial distress, and second, requesting the Tianjin Postal Director</p>
<h3 id="e160">Telegraph the General Bureau <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>To issue full salaries for August before the middle of the month to provide relief, avoiding hardship. This was the situation before August 3. On the afternoon of August 3, another report was received from the Friendship Association that the local Municipal Party Department had sent personnel to the labor union to comfort the Northeast laborers entering the pass and launched a large-scale charitable campaign to provide relief to Northeast postal workers arriving in Tianjin. A joint meeting was convened at 9 AM today at the Municipal Party Department, gathering representatives from the Social Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Labor Union, Postal Workers' Union, Workers' Union, and Jilin and Heilongjiang. The results include cleaning up the already borrowed Social Bureau building, adding planks, installing electric lights (installed free of charge by the Social Bureau), and providing appropriate sanitation equipment for the laborers, serving as the first reception center. The Public Security Bureau was also requested to borrow a private property from a certain family as the second reception center. From then on, the above groups and agencies will send personnel to the labor union every day to discuss the implementation of the measures, as is</p>
<h3 id="e161">Regarding Reception <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>For the comrades arriving in Tianjin, a concrete method has been devised, but efforts still need to be made to assist the laborers financially. Due to the loss of their home bases, the finances of the Northeast comrades are in dire straits, and they have no ability to save themselves. Apart from requesting the bureau to issue August salaries to provide relief, there are few appropriate measures. The war department's office in Tianjin is already finding it difficult to cope. Upon further investigation, it was found that the comrades from Liaoning withdrew and entered the pass separately, with Tianjin and Beiping as the main</p>

<p>Those who watch the wind and steer the ship, forgetting their country and their deep hatred, are most hateful. Now, because they are displeased with the Japanese, they are taking the opportunity to return. The comrades have already suffered under their coercion, and public secrets have been betrayed by them, leading to shared suffering. These traitors should be punished. Moreover, these people can betray the country in the Northeast, so why can't they seize the opportunity to re-enact the old drama in Beiping and Tianjin? We adhere to the principle of eradicating evil completely and will not be lenient. Therefore, we should request that after a clear investigation, the General Association be reported to request punishment for these individuals. Upon further investigation, it was found that many Northeast comrades entering the pass have been transferred to Shanghai. Although the transfer of employees should be subject to</p>

<p>However, those colleagues with lower salaries, if transferred to the South, would suffer greatly from the unfamiliar climate and different dialects. It is proposed to request the General Association to ask the General Bureau to allow all non-southern natives or those who are unwilling to report to Tianjin, Qingdao, and Beijing, to show consideration. As for the offices of the department stationed in Beijing and Tianjin, they have now been organized and established. In the future, it is planned to hold a joint meeting of the two offices in Beijing and Tianjin to formulate specific requirements and submit them to the General Bureau for implementation. All of the above-mentioned department's recent handling of the reception process and requests are hereby submitted to your association to promptly contact the General Bureau for processing, which is a matter of public convenience.

<p>Also, Liu Yaoting, Deputy Postal Director of the Shenyang Bureau in the Liaoning District, was ordered by Director General Huang to go to Tianjin to settle the employees entering the pass and handle the reception affairs. It is learned that Mr. Liu has already established an office in Tianjin and is trying his best to settle them, so as to avoid the suffering of patriotic employees who are displaced. The National Postal Workers' General Association and the National Postal Workers' Union also intend to have relief measures and will start raising funds from members across the country to provide assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Measures for Handling Mail from the Three Northeastern Provinces by the Local Postal Bureau <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has made corrections regarding the measures for handling mail from the Three Northeastern Provinces. Yesterday, Bureau Edict No. 1629 was issued, stating: "For the purpose of notifying matters, the suspension of postal services in the Three Northeastern Provinces and the measures for mail from the Three Northeastern Provinces were previously notified in Bureau Edicts No. 1602, No. 1606, and No. 1612. Now, the order from the General Post Office is open, and the supplementary measures for mail from the Three Northeastern Provinces are detailed below. All are to be followed and implemented: (1) All types of imported mail originating from the Three Northeastern Provinces (excluding the South Manchurian Railway Zone) and forwarded through Dalian or other foreign exchange bureaus, affixed with (1) "Manchukuo" postage stamps, (2) Japanese ordinary postage stamps, or (3) Republic of China postage stamps, and canceled with various styles of Japanese chops (including those with the year 32 chop), shall be regarded as mail with insufficient postage and charged double the postage. If encountering sealed general packages, they shall be rejected. However, mail affixed with uncanceled Republic of China postage stamps, or mail genuinely originating from the Kwantung Leased Territory and affixed with Japanese postage stamps, shall still be treated as mail with sufficient postage. All mail originating from the South Manchurian Railway Zone (excluding the Kwantung Leased Territory), if affixed with Japanese ordinary postage stamps, shall be treated as underpaid, but only the domestic postage rate shall be charged. (2) Export mail: A. All mail addressed to various places in the Three Northeastern Provinces (excluding the South Manchurian Railway Zone and the Kwantung Leased Territory) shall not be accepted. If dropped into mailboxes, it shall be immediately returned to the sender or sent to the undeliverable mail office. B. All export mail going to the Kwantung Leased Territory or the South Manchurian Railway Zone shall be accepted and forwarded through Dalian as usual (see Annex No. 5 to the Sino-Japanese Postal Agreement No. 545 in the Foreign Language Circular). C. All export mail going to Korea shall be forwarded through Dalian or Japan to the destination as usual. D. All export mail going to the Asian part of Russia shall be handed over to direct steamships and forwarded via Shanghai and Vladivostok. Do not forward it through Japan. E. All export mail going to European countries and the European part of Russia, even if specifying transshipment via Japan or Siberia, shall still be rerouted by sea, using the fastest steamships via the Suez Canal or the Pacific Ocean. In short, regarding the sealing and forwarding methods for mail formerly transshipped via Siberia or the Three Northeastern Provinces (excluding the South Manchurian Railway Zone and the Kwantung Leased Territory), unless further instructions are given in the future, Japan shall not be used as a transshipment bureau for such mail. If various bureaus receive various types of letters from overseas, whether ordinary, registered, or insured, originally destined for various places in the Three Northeastern Provinces (excluding the South Manchurian Railway Zone and the Kwantung Leased Territory), they shall be stamped with "Postal Services Suspended in the Three Northeastern Provinces, Return to Sender" and returned to the original sending bureau. Also, if various bureaus receive imported international ordinary insurance or cash-on-delivery parcels originally intended for the Three Northeastern Provinces, they shall be handled according to the following methods: All parcels sent from the United States shall be immediately returned to the original sending bureau through the usual exchange bureau, and the exchange bureau shall choose the cheapest freight rate and postal route for their return. If sent from Europe, they shall first consult the original sending bureau and solicit the sender's opinion before returning them. If the sender requests return, our exchange bureau shall return them to the original sending bureau, but careful consideration must be given to choosing the cheapest postal route (the Greater Shanghai Route). Also, for mail or parcels concerning places in the Three Northeastern Provinces other than the Kwantung Leased Territory or the South Manchurian Railway Zone, the mail or parcels shall be returned to the sender regardless of whether the postage stamps are canceled or not, even if the mail or parcels have not left the original sending bureau. It should be noted that the withdrawal of our Chinese postal service from the Three Northeastern Provinces is a matter of necessity due to force majeure and should be handled according to the established precedent of force majeure." Upon receiving this, all are to comply and implement accordingly. This edict is issued by Postal Director Zha Pei, Lin.</p>

<p>Li Xianfu, a patrolman from the Fifth District, Third Precinct of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, had a dispute with Shen Xiaodi, the deputy foreman of the No. 4 ferry of the Public Utilities Bureau, and sailor Hou Shouquan, over a mosquito net and pole being carried on the No. 4 ferry at the Ningguo Temple ferry terminal in this city on May 8 of this year, leading to a fight. The police from the Fifth District, Third Precinct, apprehended Li Xianfu and Hou Shouquan and sent them to the Nanshi District Court. The court summoned Shen Xiaodi for questioning on June 3. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau also sent employee Li Mu to accompany him while awaiting questioning. After the questioning, the court ordered bail. Li Mu then went to the sales office to purchase stationery, but not knowing the format, he inquired with the staff in charge of the sales office. At this time, a shyster named Lu Xiang, who often hangs out in the Xinhua Garden teahouse next to the court, saw him, entered, and pulled Li Mu's coat to the Xinhua Garden teahouse, telling Li Mu that there was a way to deal with the stationery, but the timing was awkward. After Li Mu's request, he agreed to find a way for a price of three yuan. Li Mu explained that the bailee was an employee of the Public Utilities Bureau and that public funds could not be used at will. Another person then bargained it down to two yuan. Finally, for one yuan and two jiao, Lu wrote a bail bond from his own handkerchief package and sold it to Li Mu. Later, on the 14th of the same month, Hou Shouquan was summoned again and accompanied by Li Mu to the District Court to await questioning. After the questioning, the court ordered bail. Lu Xiang again sold a bail bond to Li Mu for one yuan and two jiao. After Li Mu returned to the bureau, he reported the situation to Bureau Chief Huang Baiqiao. Huang Baiqiao immediately sent a letter to the court's Chief Prosecutor, who was furious. He secretly sent a prosecutor to investigate the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. According to Li Mu's confession, he knew the whole story. He secretly ordered Li Mu to turn Lu Xiang over to the court and ordered the staff in charge of the sales office to come to court to investigate. It was found that Lu Xiang, due to unemployment, had been borrowing the name of a lawyer in the Xinhua Garden teahouse on Xinhua Road next to the court, secretly making a lawyer's seal, selling stationery, writing pleadings for others, and reselling them to litigants at high prices, extorting money for a living. It was determined that Lu Xiang had violated Article 364, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and a public prosecution was filed according to law. The court hopes that the people in the jurisdiction will be informed. In the future, if they are deceived by shysters again and discover their exploitation and extortion, they should immediately bring them to the court with a guarantor and file a complaint. They will definitely be severely punished according to law.</p>

The agenda is recorded below: (1) Discussing the method of rescuing patriotic figures Wan Fang. Resolution: A. The Citizens' United Association sent a letter to the Association notifying that a general meeting would be held today at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to discuss the matter of rescuing Mr. Wan.

Confidential, not to be published for the time being. C. Mr. Wang Jian'e's letter will be answered verbally by Committee Member Shen Junru, and the next meeting will be reserved for review. D. Suggesting to the central government that the Legislative Yuan should quickly order trial by jury.

A petition to the Control Yuan to impeach Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Guan Yunhui for illegally extraditing Yun Huifang to the concession police station after she was arrested in the Chinese court's jurisdiction without submitting it to the Shanghai District Court for review according to law. Committee member Li Shirui was elected to draft the document, which will be submitted to the Standing Committee for review and issuance. (2) Standing Committee Member Shen Junru reported that the Association had previously donated 10,000 yuan to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association. Now, the Association has sent a letter stating that the Northeast military situation is urgent and that funds are urgently needed. Someone has purchased machinery for assistance. The procedure for allocating funds should be changed and funds should be allocated quickly. Resolution: Passed. (3) The Shanghai Second Special District Court's Secretariat sent a letter requesting that all members be informed that they should conscientiously perform their duties when assigned by the defendant to provide mandatory defense. If there are genuine obstacles, they should notify the Court as soon as possible. Resolution: Inform all members to pay attention. (4) Member Xu Yongyao's letter reported that lawyer Lu Qi committed perjury and requested review. Committee members Chen Tingrui and Zhang Zhengxue immediately declared abstention. Resolution: Forward the letter to member Lu Qi for reply. (5) The Shanghai Second Special District Court scheduled to burn toxic substances and sent a letter requesting that members be sent to supervise the event. Resolution: Committee member Zhang Zhengxue was elected to go to supervise the event when the time comes. (6) Lawyers Sun Zairen and Wang Shuchiao applied for membership. Resolution: Passed. (7) Committee member Shen Junru proposed to the Shanghai Second Special District Court to designate the first seat on the west side of the first courtroom (that is, the long seat opposite the police station lawyer's seat) as the seat for attending lawyers. Resolution: Suggest that the Second Special District Court discuss it. The meeting adjourned. A telegram to the Court and the Legislative Yuan reads: To President Ju of the Nanjing Judicial Yuan, Vice President, Minister of the Ministry of Justice, Vice Ministers Zheng and Shi, and President Shao of the Legislative Yuan and all committee members: Criminal jury trial is a common system in all countries in the world. Its advantage lies in enabling ordinary people to apply common sense and emotions to trials. The Association and legal circles in the country have advocated the adoption of this system for many years. Now that the country is in trouble, the patriotic actions of the people are not in line with the law, which is debatable. If everyone is punished according to the law, it will violate national sentiment and the national position, and it will not be using the court to speak for the enemy. It will make society and the public doubt the final result of the law. It is not established for the survival of the country and society, and if there is a danger of harming the country and society, if you want to talk about law and emotion, it is inevitable to get close to extrication. It is not only a population of real people to the outside world, but also a danger of destroying the law to the inside. The Association has carefully considered that in the case of such a contradiction between emotion and law, the jury system, which combines emotion and law, can be fair. Each time a criminal is caught, he is first sent to the jury meeting. If he is declared guilty, he will be punished according to law, and the people will have no complaints. If he is declared innocent, the dignity of the law will be intact, and the court will not bear the brunt, and foreigners will have no way to criticize. The adoption of the jury system in France is also motivated by specific facts. Now, such cases in our country are emerging one after another. The courts are in a dilemma, and society and the public and the defendants are unable to protect themselves. We can only ask your hospital to quickly formulate a jury system for national affairs crimes and issue it for implementation. All acts aimed at protecting the interests of the country and the nation who violate the criminal law, regardless of whether they are guilty or innocent, shall be handed over to the jury meeting for resolution, and then the court shall release them or declare punishment, which is the best way to plan. I hope you will adopt it resolutely. The country is very fortunate, the law is very fortunate. Shanghai Lawyers Association Standing Committee Shen Junru, Li Shirui, Lu Dingkui, kowtow, seal, cold.</p>

<p>Requesting the Promulgation of the Rent Exemption Situation in the Central District. The 21st Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' United Association and the Hangkou-Shanxi Roads Business Association stated that the Shanghai Municipal Government's announcement of four measures to reduce or exempt rent did not clearly specify the Central District. Members of the association often have lawsuits with landlords and cannot mediate. Yesterday, they presented a document to the Municipal Government, requesting it to comply with public opinion and promptly announce the details to avoid disputes. The original text is as follows: Presenting [to the] Petition to Promulgate a Clear Decree on Rent Exemption Measures in the Central District, to Ensure Fairness and Settle Disputes. It is humbly submitted that since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai on January 28, the entire city has united to resist the invasion. The public, under the rain of guns and snow, helped the old and the young, crying from hunger and cold, and fled to other places in an endless stream. Markets were closed, businesses were shut down, and the commercial sector was paralyzed. Japanese planes roamed and dropped bombs everywhere, day after day. At that time, the public was as distraught as if they had lost their parents upon hearing the sound of bombs. Victims were separated from their families. Alas, who has no parents, who has no wife and children? How can this situation be tolerated? The public lost their jobs and spent their savings. In these two months, no sector was spared from the losses. The scale of the losses is immeasurable. Newspapers have reported on it, and the facts are clear and undeniable. Although we have survived the disaster and reluctantly reopened for business, the devastation of commerce and the stagnation of the economy are due to the Japanese invasion. The enlightened people of Shanghai, in view of this, believe that if we do not take remedial measures immediately, we will not be able to relieve the public from their hardship. What is the solution? The first step is to demand the reduction or exemption of rent to ease the burden on the public. Therefore, various legal entities in the city have petitioned to determine a standard for the reduction or exemption of rent in the areas affected by the war, so as to relieve the public's distress and avoid disputes. Fortunately, the Municipal Government adopted it and announced four rent exemption measures in Announcement No. 28. However, the situation regarding rent exemption in our Central District has not been clearly promulgated, causing public anxiety. The Central District is also part of Shanghai and has the most prosperous businesses and the highest rents in the city. This time, it was also affected by the Japanese invasion. Japanese planes roamed the Central District, causing merchants and residents to panic. The streets were empty, and markets and businesses were closed. The losses were even greater than in the north. Even the cities of Nanjing and Hangzhou, which are adjacent to Shanghai, reduced rents due to the Shanghai Incident. Now that the government has announced rent exemption measures, it has remained silent on the Central District, as if the Central District is not part of Shanghai or there is some special relationship, and we are not given rent exemption, which is incomprehensible. Recently, because the Central District has not received any regulations on rent reduction, landlords and tenants have frequently had disputes and filed lawsuits against each other. Members have come to the association one after another, requesting assistance. The association is at a loss and has no way to mediate. Since the Shanghai Incident, various industries have closed to resist the invasion, and the Central District has also been closed for two months. At that time, the police were on high alert, as if facing a great enemy. Japanese planes bombed the city from the air, and the public were trapped and could not do business at all. The losses were immeasurable. According to the facts at that time, the rent in the Central District must be reduced or exempted in law and in reason. Therefore, we present the previous situation and submit this document to the government, requesting it to comply with public opinion and promptly announce the rent reduction measures in the Central District to avoid disputes and settle lawsuits. It is a matter of great benefit. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>The Result Stated That She Was Indeed a Virgin Before Marriage</p>
<p>Song Tianxiang Still Abused His Wife</p>
<p>The Wife Could Not Bear It and Requested Mediation for Divorce</p>
<p>Song Tianxiang from Ningbo returned to his hometown in October of the previous year and married a fellow villager, Tu Fumei. Because Song practiced medicine in Shanghai, he took Tu to Shanghai a few days after the marriage. At this time, he suddenly accused his wife of not being a virgin and forcibly sent her to a doctor on Baike Road for examination. Ms. Tu had no relatives or friends in Shanghai and had to let Song do as he pleased. The examination determined that she was indeed a virgin before marriage. Song was speechless. However, after a few days, the suspicion remained. He sent Tu to a Japanese-run hospital on North Sichuan Road for a second examination. The result was the same as before. Song realized that he had insulted a woman and apologized to his wife with a whip. Tu wanted to maintain the marital relationship and was persuaded by her brother who came from Ningbo to Shanghai. They reconciled. However, after her brother left, Song's treatment of her became even more abusive. He secretly pawned her jewelry to fund his gambling and prostitution and neglected his legal wife. Although her mother-in-law came to mediate, it was impossible to reconcile. Recently, Tu could no longer bear to live with him and hired lawyer Wu Zhi to file a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the First Special District Court, requesting mediation for divorce and compensation for all losses. The court approved the petition and ordered Song Tianxiang to appear in court for mediation.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai war, all the people were troubled by the difficulties, with tiles and rubble, and returned to their difficult livelihoods. Zhao, president of the Southeast General Office of the Shanghai Red Swastika Society, and Lin, Mr. Jin Jianguang, and Mr. Niu Zan, set off in June of this year, starting from Wusong to Jiangwan to Dachang. They lasted more than 50 days, and the disaster areas were the most serious in Wusong and Jiangwan. It is still possible to maintain at the Zhabei Baziqiao and other places, and no disaster relief is needed. All of the Wusong and Shanghai relief operations have ended yesterday. According to Zhao and others, the plight of the displaced people in the disaster area is unbearable to watch. The deaths in Jiangwan are estimated at more than 1,100, and in Wusong at more than 700. The survivors were all women, children, and the elderly. Although the purpose has been to help people get through their lives by Hongwanji's relief operations, there is still a long way to go. It is hoped that charitable organizations will find ways to take care of the aftermath, so that the survivors still have a chance to live. Otherwise, they will still be in danger of starvation.

<h3 id="e179">Carpenter Throws Stone at Tram, Arrested <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Agui, a resident of Wusong, at 10:40 PM the day before yesterday, threw stones at a No. 7 tram near Dongxi Huade Road and Gongping Road, causing trouble for the driver, Wei Longhai. Wei got out of the tram and apprehended Zhang, handing him over to Chinese patrol officer No. 2083 and Chinese detective Xu Bingnan, who took him to the Huishan Police Station. The next morning, he was brought to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, explained the situation. The driver, Wei Longhai, testified that when the tram arrived at the location, the defendant, along with more than ten other people, threw stones directly at the tram. Fortunately, none of the passengers were injured. He jumped down and questioned the defendant, and his accomplices violently beat him, tearing his uniform. However, he still managed to capture him and hand him over to the police. The ticket seller, Chen Jinhai, testified that he was selling tickets in the first-class compartment when stones were thrown in. Zhang Agui claimed that he worked as a carpenter with Chen Fulin at No. 917 Gongping Road on Dongxi Huade Road. Recently, due to the hot weather, his elderly mother and sister were cooling off at the door every evening, and the tram driver, Wei Longhai, would pass by and put his fingers in his mouth, making sounds and teasing his elderly mother several times. The previous night, he threw watermelon rinds at him, not stones. After a while, the tram returned, and he got out, along with several others, and beat his waist with wooden benches. He requested the court to investigate. Judge Fu Lin reviewed the statements and ordered him remanded in custody, postponing the hearing until the carpenter boss Chen Fulin was brought to court for further questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Municipal Police Bureau Detective Team Captures Hu Lifu <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Arrest of a Traitor Can be Considered Punishing Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>Detective's Labor Alleviates New National Hatred</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, half of Zhabei has been devastated by Japanese artillery fire, and the essence of Shanghai has been destroyed. All of us Chinese people should endure hardship and be determined to avenge the national humiliation. Unexpectedly, when our army retreated to the second line of defense, there were even madmen who betrayed their country and sided with the enemy, such as the traitors Hu Lifu, Chang Yuqing, Wang Du, Yao Zidu, etc. They seized the opportunity to collude with the Japanese, using the illegal organization called the Shanghai Beishi Local People's Maintenance Association as a cover. On one hand, they extorted money from the people, and on the other hand, they acted as spies for the Japanese army, providing the Japanese army with military advantages and harming our national army with military disadvantages. Their various crimes are countless. Among them, Hu was the mastermind. The municipal government had issued a warrant for his arrest. After the ceasefire agreement was signed, the traitors knew that they had nowhere to hide. They initially ordered their followers to spread rumors, saying that Hu had fled to Dalian and Shenyang, and some even said that they had fled to Japan, in order to deceive the arresting officers. In fact, Hu and others never left Shanghai, but their whereabouts were secret and unpredictable. They even disguised themselves and had close contacts with the Japanese. This was discovered by Lu Ying, the captain of the Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Team, who secretly ordered his subordinates to intensify their investigation a month ago, in order to arrest Hu and others as soon as possible, to punish the traitors and deter the wicked. At around 6 PM the day before yesterday, Captain Lu received a secret report from detective Hu Kui Sheng, saying that the traitor leader Hu Lifu was hiding under a false name at No. 198 Doulean Road in the Public Concession. Tonight (the 13th), he was scheduled to have dinner with his Japanese friend Yuan San at the Xinya Restaurant on North Sichuan Road. He requested that detectives be dispatched to arrest him as soon as possible. After receiving the report, Captain Lu immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to disguise themselves and wait at the address. That night, Hu was arrested. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e182">Disguised Reconnaissance <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the report, Captain Lu immediately dispatched team leader Wu Xiufeng, along with detectives Chen Guangyan, Wu Zuorong, Liu Changrui, Wang Hongyi, Hu Kui Sheng, and translator Xia Zhongming, in cars, and drove straight to the vicinity of the Xinya Restaurant on North Sichuan Road, setting up an ambush. At the same time, Hu Kui Sheng, the informant, disguised himself as a waiter, waiting for Hu's arrival. At 6:45 PM, Hu finally arrived, wearing a straw hat and black glasses to avoid recognition. He was wearing a white summer cloth long gown and silk shoes. He first walked out of his residence on Doulean Road and walked to the home of Yuan San, a Japanese, in Yuqingfang on North Sichuan Road. Then he went to the Xinya Restaurant with Yuan San.</p>
<h3 id="e183">A Signal <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Hu and Yuan San went upstairs to the Xinya Restaurant. Hu immediately took off his long gown, and the detective Hu Kui Sheng, disguised as a waiter, took the gown and hung it on the hook. At that time, the clock struck seven. Hu Kui Sheng gave a signal, and team leader Wu Xiufeng led the detectives upstairs, showed Hu the official document, and handcuffed Hu. A six-inch Browning pistol was found on his body, along with two clips of ammunition, a total of thirteen bullets. At that time, Hu's face was pale. He was taken to the car and directly to the team. Captain Lu personally interrogated him. According to his statement, he was 52 years old, from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, residing at No. 105 and a half Jinle Lane, Weihaiwei Road, Public Concession, and currently residing at No. 189 Doulean Road, where he runs a leather tanning factory. Since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, he had no other actions. Until March 1st, after our army retreated, an old friend, a Japanese named Washizaki, invited him to the Zhabei war zone on March 24th to organize the Shanghai Beishi Local Citizen Maintenance Association. He did not agree at that time. Washizaki said that now in Zhabei, generally Jiangbei people are making it so that the local people cannot sleep peacefully, so they must find a way. He thought this was reasonable, and said to Washizaki that since this was the case, he must invite an upright Chinese person to maintain local order, and he would express his consent. However, if he were to do this, he would have to submit a request to the municipal government for approval before proceeding. Unexpectedly, when he was about to submit the request, he learned that the municipal government had already issued a warrant for his arrest, leaving him in a dilemma and at a loss. He had to organize the Shanghai Beishi Local Citizen Maintenance Association on Minli Road in Zhabei.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Confesses to Collecting Taxes <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>After it was established, it did cleaning the roads and burying dead bodies. As for the source of all expenses, it was to collect a tax of two percent of the estimated value of the goods when moving goods from shops in Zhabei that had not been affected by the disaster. Thus, it was possible to collect 100 to 200 yuan of transportation tax every day. At that time, due to the urgent work, he recruited dozens of plainclothes policemen and about a hundred investigators to investigate the moving of goods by various merchants, so as to estimate the value and collect the tax. The tax revenue was entirely used to maintain the local area. Therefore, when organizing the Maintenance Association, he did not ask the Japanese for advances. This matter was his own idea. Unexpectedly, while he was working, accomplices Chang Yuqing, Wang Du, Cheng Xizhi, Yao Wu (Yao Ziduan) and others under him did all sorts of disreputable things, resulting in negotiations. Later, the Japanese command forced the dissolution of the Association, and he fled to the second district of the Linping Road Maintenance Association. At that time, the general public shouted that they wanted to overthrow him. At that time, his finances were very tight.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Establishing Gambling Dens <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Later, he discussed with Chang Yuqing, Yao Ziduan, and others to start a gambling den to solve the urgent problem. While they were planning, a Japanese named Yokota also had this idea. They went to discuss this matter, and he expressed his support. Cheng Xizhi went out to contact and recruit people to gamble, resulting in the opening of as many as eight places. Later, Huahui, opium dens, and native goods stores were all opened there. In a few dozen days, they obtained a total of 9,000 yuan in taxes, but the Japanese Yokota took more than half of it. The rest of the money was used for expenses. He requested an investigation into the facts stated. The interrogation ended at midnight. After obtaining the confession, Captain Lu, considering the importance of the case, ordered him to be detained in the team.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Captain Lu's Statement <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>He was sent to the detention center at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Because it was Sunday, the office was closed. He will prepare a document today and transfer it to the Judicial Section for investigation according to law. According to Captain Lu, regarding the case of Hu and others, after the municipal government issued a warrant for their arrest, he actively investigated and never slackened. As for what a certain newspaper said today (yesterday) that Hu was fooled by the Japanese Yuan San and sold out his friends for money, it was purely fabricated. He instructed him to clarify this. He also said that after Hu was arrested that evening, considering the importance of the case and the need to pursue accomplices, a certain newspaper disclosed the information without consent, causing all the accomplices to flee, making the arrest difficult and dealing a blow to the detective's work, which was regrettable.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Petition for Execution <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai North District Chamber of Commerce General Federation, according to the petitions of various branch associations, requested the military and political authorities to execute the traitor Hu Lifu immediately, to show the Shanghai people and warn those who sell their country. Here is the original petition: "Petition for the immediate execution of the traitor leader Hu Lifu, to maintain the national foundation and warn future generations. The association, according to reports from Xing Minyi, representative of the North Shanghai Fifth District Branch, and Qiu Liangyu, representative of the Zhabei Fifth Road Branch, etc., stated that the traitor leader Hu Lifu has been captured and is being held in custody by the Public Security Bureau. Since the January 28th Incident, within the scope of the association's jurisdiction, he has committed all kinds of evils, and the merchants hate him to the bone, such as murder, arson, running opium and gambling dens, hiring Jiangbei poor people to throw bombs at the front line, and disrupting the rear, etc., and killing countless loyal 19th Route Army martyrs. Anyone who has patriotic aspirations and whose behavior is inconsistent with that of the traitor has been shot and killed. The traitor relied on the power of the Japanese occupation to do whatever he wanted. Even if he is immediately executed, it is not enough to cover his guilt. They pleaded to submit a special petition to the military and political authorities, to execute him immediately, and to parade him in public one day before the execution, so as to slightly comfort the loyal souls of the patriotic people and warn other traitors. The merchants of North Shanghai have suffered deeply, and they have made this urgent statement to vent their anger. Based on this, the crimes committed by Hu Lifu are indeed unforgivable. Therefore, we submit this document, hoping that your department (government) will show the public, execute him immediately, to comfort public opinion and maintain national discipline, and kill one to warn a hundred, so that those who come later will fear the law. Respectfully submitted to the Songhu Garrison Command and the Shanghai Municipal Government."</p>

Now, in order to promote national production, all goods certified by our hall will be displayed, and introduction books will be printed and distributed to chambers of commerce in various domestic ports and consulates and overseas Chinese associations in various countries to publicize and introduce them, so as to increase the efficiency of the production and sales of domestic goods. It has been verified that the products of your factory have been certified by our hall and are indeed domestic goods. We hope that you will prepare one piece of each product and send it to our hall for display as soon as possible, and fill in the product application form in detail for introduction, so as to promote them.

<p>The District Court is Clearing Cases. Because the amnesty decree has been promulgated, the procedures for clearing cases regarding the commutation and complete amnesty of the various pardoned criminals based on the amnesty regulations are complicated. Therefore, Prosecutor Wu Derong has been specially appointed to handle this matter and has already compiled and verified them. However, there are very few of the convicted criminals who committed the most severe crimes who are eligible for the amnesty regulations. Therefore, there are very few who are completely pardoned.</p>
<h3 id="e190">National Goods Association Asks Silver and Money Industries to Reduce Interest Rates <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association believes that the silver and money industries treat loans to national goods factories the same as loans to foreign goods operators, and there is no preferential treatment for the industrial and commercial circles that promote national goods. It has been resolved to send a letter to the Silver and Money Association, notifying members to reduce interest rates, so as to comply with the intention of support. The original letter is as follows: "We hereby inform you that at the 26th meeting of the 12th session of our association, Executive Committee members Zhang Qingfa and Zhang Dexian proposed that the silver and money industries be asked to reduce the interest rates on loans to domestic goods factories and increase the interest rates on loans to foreign goods operators, so as to develop industry and alleviate people's livelihood. It was resolved to send a letter to the parties concerned for handling, so as to maintain domestic goods. It has been recorded that domestic goods factories have weak finances and rely on the assistance of your members for turnover. At this time of severe national crisis and the autumn of foreign goods dumping, it is an opportunity for domestic goods factories to step up production. However, due to capital relations, they cannot expand, and they can only borrow money for replenishment. We still hope that your association will notify all members, upholding the national spirit of protecting domestic goods and saving the country. In the future, the interest rates on borrowing money for domestic goods factories should be reduced by one or two points compared with borrowing money for foreign goods operations. That is, what is lost will be added to foreign goods merchants. There will be no loss to your members, and domestic goods factories will benefit greatly. This is also a way to encourage Chinese people to operate domestic goods and eliminate unscrupulous merchants who promote foreign goods. Economic aggression has a profound impact on the future. Corresponding letters are hereby sent, hoping that you will take note of this and look forward to a reply."</p>

Therefore, Hu and Lin will soon be seen in court again.</p>

<p>Wu Guangqin, extremely bored, Yangxingren, Baoshan. Wu Guangqin, 24 years old, used to run a gold business, but failed shortly thereafter, suffering huge losses, resulting in all his property over the years being used to compensate for the losses. Later, he was unemployed, so his livelihood was very difficult. Recently, he planned to sell the only two houses he had left in his hometown, so as to reinvest the proceeds and hope to revitalize his business. He once discussed this with his mother-in-law, Che Liu, while simultaneously planning to have his wife, Che Xingzhen, temporarily reside with her parents. However, he stopped because he did not get his mother-in-law's consent. Yesterday morning at ten o'clock, Wu went to resubmit his proposal. His mother-in-law, Che Liu, firmly opposed it, on the grounds that if the house was sold and Wu's business failed again, she would have nowhere to go. Therefore, they argued with each other and refused to give in. Wu Guangqin, in a moment of anger, stabbed Che Liu twelve times with a knife and fled. The injured parts of her body included four wounds on the face, three on the left arm, two on the left leg, and one on the chest. Later, neighbors noticed the incident. However, the murderer had already escaped, and they hurriedly hired a car to send her to the Hubao Long Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injuries were very serious and there was a risk of death.</p>

<p>Bullet Enters Abdomen, Falls to the Ground. At 5:15 AM yesterday morning, four robbers suddenly came to the house of Wu Ma, a Wuxi woman, at No. 56 Glo Road in the French Concession. They were wearing white cloth short shirts and pants, of medium build, and spoke in the local accent. They entered through the back door and threatened with pistols. Two robbers stood guard downstairs, and two robbers went upstairs and rummaged through boxes and cabinets in the front room, robbing gold jewelry worth 557 yuan, wrapped it in a package, and escaped through the back door. One of the robbers, carrying the stolen goods, was walking north along Edward Road in the British Concession, when he was encountered by Chinese patrol officers No. 1653 and No. 1707 from the Laozha Police Station, who suspected his appearance and immediately stopped him, asking where the items came from. The robber replied that he had brought them from a friend. The two patrol officers saw that his answers were evasive and were about to take him to the police station. The robber saw that the situation was not good, that the matter had been exposed, and that he could not escape. In desperation, he took out a pistol and fired a shot into his left side. The bullet entered his abdomen, and he fell to the ground. The two patrol officers were shocked and immediately seized the pistol, notified the police station, and sent a car to take the robber to the Bureau of Works Hospital for treatment. The robber confessed that his surname was Qian, his name was Fu, he was from Wuxi, he was 26 years old, and he admitted the robbery. The patrol officers took him back to the police station to wait for verification.</p>

<p>Yang Yin-shen, in view of the fact that most of the Chinese literary history books published in Fangjian are only suitable for classroom lectures, and there are few supplementary materials available for students and teachers to refer to, has made a grand wish to collect supplementary materials for historical studies in addition to lecturing on Chinese literary history, and compile it into the "Outline Series of Chinese Literature".

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the news about the Japanese organizing secret spy teams, our agency is entirely based on facts. As for the Japanese infiltrating the audience during the trial of Yun Huifang in the Second Special District Court the other day, this was also based on facts and not fabricated out of thin air. We are deeply shocked by the report in yesterday's newspaper that the Japanese were using one or two Chinese traitors to spread rumors. The purpose of our agency is to expose various Japanese conspiracies, so as to provide our authorities and patriotic people with information for reference and prevention. Therefore, we have made every effort to inquire and publish information about the Japanese side. We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life in Shanghai will give us their sympathy and assistance in order to expand the foundation of the anti-Japanese movement. Please do not lightly believe the Japanese's divisive words and suspect each other, which would be a Japanese trick. This is what we earnestly hope for.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e207">Cai E and Wang Jiang <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>Cai E, under the surveillance of Yuan Shikai, used a clever trick to escape. He deliberately indulged in wine and women, purposefully taking a concubine, and intentionally causing discord in his family. He even had a lawsuit with his wife, creating a plausible domestic squabble, so that his wife left in anger. Who knew that this was his plan to first send his family away so that he could show Yuan Shikai a clean pair of heels? Yuan Shikai, known for his cleverness, was ultimately fooled, leading to the cancellation of the imperial system and ending the political life of the Hongxian Emperor during his diabetic illness.</p>
<p>In fact, Cai E's trick was not original; it had been done before. He simply followed the original plan with some minor adjustments. During the Ming Dynasty, the exiled official and censor Wang Jiang was kept in Hangzhou by a Qing general who treated him as an honored guest with lavish accommodations. However, Wang Jiang's patriotic heart was eager to escape and join the supervising regent to restore the lost territory. He was only hindered by the Qing soldiers' surveillance, so he came up with the trick of escaping like a cicada shedding its skin. I read in the collected works of Quan Zuwang, a great Qing Dynasty writer from Zhexieshan, a passage about the censor Wang: "The official suddenly bought a concubine, whom he favored greatly. As a result, his wife quarreled and scolded him day and night. The official then sued her and had her removed. The wife also raised her arms and boarded a carriage, listing the official's hidden faults as she left, shocking the neighbors. The official traveled on the lake, and the guards, not suspecting anything because his concubine was there, did not prevent him from leaving. Only then did they realize that he had used a trick to get rid of his wife. After escaping, the official took his wife back and sailed to Jinmen to pay homage to the supervising regent."</p>
<p>Cai Songpo's trick had already been exposed in Quan Zuwang's collected works two hundred years earlier! It is said that there were many scholars around Yuan Shikai. If someone had shown the Hongxian Emperor this passage from Quan Zuwang's collected works while Cai E and his wife were playing this trick, Cai E might not have escaped! Why didn't anyone notice this article at the time? To say something outdated, it was fate!</p>
<h3 id="e208">On the Musician Liu Tianhua <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Jixiang</p>
<p>The famous musician Liu Tianhua passed away in the old capital a month ago. The news of his death was shocking. Everyone, both familiar and unfamiliar with him, was deeply grieved. Tianhua was the younger brother of Liu Fu (Bannong). Both brothers were famous figures in our hometown. After Tianhua's death, Liu Fu wrote on his portrait, saying that Tianhua had the deepest accomplishments in the pipa and erhu. The pipa piece "Ambush from Ten Sides" is majestic, powerful, and full of variations. It cannot be performed without Tianhua's great spirit. In the erhu, he was especially able to express his wonderful ideas and create new sounds. Every time he drew his bow, he could make the audience linger and savor the music, weep and sing for no reason, moving people deeply beyond compare. The erhu was originally a humble instrument, but because of Tianhua, it ascended to a higher level. Westerners who heard Tianhua's music exclaimed that without him, they would not have known that China had music. It is also said that in addition to his specialties, Tianhua also carefully studied everything related to music, such as the dulcimer, bugle, guqin ensemble music, as well as Kunqu opera, Beijing opera, Buddhist music, and popular music, and understood their principles and interests. He also had a glimpse of the study of harmony and composition, and the ancient theories of rhythm and temperament. He was also proficient in the violin and studied with the famous Russian teacher Tonov. Some say that he was the only person in the world who was proficient in both Chinese and Western music, mastered both theory and practice, and was able to understand the connections between them. However, he was always cautious and did not write easily. Therefore, he only wrote a dozen or so "Erhu and Pipa Scores" and a "Mei Lanfang Song Score," all of which have been published. His unpublished works include "Anci County Troupe Music Score" and "Buddhist Music Score," as well as several new erhu scores that have been completed or are still in progress, which will be organized and published by his disciples. These are all true records. And Tianhua's life was also spent on this. There are two musicians in our hometown who are equally famous in the world, one is Zheng Jinwen and the other is Liu. Therefore, I have a poem mourning him: "Two famous musicians in the world, Liu and Zheng are unparalleled. A generation of talents returns to the riverbank, the wind and waves move under their wrists. A song of 'Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank,' how can we call it back by striking the beat before the tomb? The Guangling melody has no successor from now on, but there are cold tides sobbing for the deceased." Zheng Jinwen is proficient in ancient music and has hand-made dozens of ancient Chinese musical instruments, all of which are rare in the world today. Now that Tianhua is dead, only Zheng remains. Recalling the sages, I cannot help but feel emotional.</p>

<p>— Ji</p>
<p>(1) When an admission test admission ticket falls into my hands, I am as happy as if I have already entered this university and become a Freshman. How troublesome it is to check my physical condition, fill out the application form, review my qualifications, and pay the registration fee. Now, I have overcome all these preliminary difficulties.</p>
<p>(2) It's almost twelve o'clock, I hurriedly hand in the paper and come out. The first thing I see is a few scribbled chalk characters on a black door:</p>
<p>"Car fare + dish money = registration fee." "Alas! The poor student is hungry! No food to eat!"</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered the physical examination fee, photo fee, registration fee, and car fare. I only got admission tickets for three universities and was squeezed out of fifteen big bucks!</p>
<p>(3) Xun said proudly that he went to take the exam for two universities and got seven more girlfriends, all very modern!</p>
<p>(4) Lian pointed to me, the one wearing a suit, he had met him when he went to take the Zhejiang University exam. Fei pointed to me, the woman with a white face, she was sitting in the seat next to him when he went to take the Shanghai University exam. Ah, I took a careful look at each face, and many of them seemed familiar to me. Wasn't it? Had I seen them in the examination room when I went to take the exams for those two universities?</p>
<p>(5) Only five minutes after the exam papers were handed out, a young man ran into the exam hall sweating profusely. He begged the proctor to allow him to participate in the exam, saying:</p>
<p>"Today is the last exam, I rushed thousands of miles from Yunnan to Shanghai to take the school exam, please let me finish the exam!"</p>
<p>"No, according to the rules, according to the regulations, it is not allowed to make exceptions!"</p>
<p>He had to leave with hot tears.</p>
<p>(6) In addition to writing a composition, a national university's Chinese language test also had two couplets: one was "Leaving home young, returning old," and the other was "Sun Wukong." According to the survey results, 80-90% of the people gave up on the first couplet. Mr. Chen, who usually has a lot of research on drama, answered "Achieving nothing, hair turning white." For the second question, most people wrote "Pigsy" or "Bull Demon King." Aren't these all Old Sun's enemies?</p>
<h3 id="e210">Gardens of the Capital <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Suicheng</p>
<p>The gardens of the capital, such as Drum Tower Park, Tao Garden, and Hu's Garden, are either barren and neglected or simple and narrow, and are not worth mentioning. Only the First Park on the bank of Fucheng Bridge, with its vast area and distance from the city center, uniquely enjoys tranquility and beauty. Therefore, garden visitors flock to it. To its south, the public sports field is only separated by a river. The river water is clear and the fish swim in groups. The banks are densely planted with weeping willows, creating a beautiful scene comparable to the Ten Mile Qinhuai River. In the park, there is a martyrs' shrine, a memorial tower, a library, a museum, as well as beautiful trees and flowers, and rare birds and animals. Everything that is needed to honor the martyrs, commemorate achievements, please the eyes and ears, and entertain the mind is fully available. There are many couplets by famous people in the Martyrs' Shrine, but they are all words of reverence for the martyrs and have nothing to do with garden visits. Only inside the main gate of the park is there a couplet engraved: "Come here to dispel all thoughts, but do not forget the revolution. Return and strive together, do not linger in this garden." The wording is moving, and the tone is neither soft nor harsh, just right. I love it very much.</p>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters is located east of Dingjiaqiao. It was originally the site of the provincial assembly. The trees are lush and the flowers are like brocade. In the past, it already had the beauty of a garden. Since it was changed to the Party Headquarters, the area has been expanded and developed, sparing no effort. Therefore, there are flowers blooming in all seasons, and trees that do not wither in the three winter months. The pond has fish, and the lotus pond has lotus flowers. The water and trees are bright and the scenery is beautiful. Even the First Park can hardly surpass it. Between the Secretariat of the Political Conference and the Statistics Office, there is a spring of water, winding like a belt. The lotus leaves are densely covering it. The banks are planted with poplars and willows, and the shade is dense. Walking in it, there is a long bridge across the water. The carved railings are extremely delicate and made of gray-white color, which reflects the green willows and red lotuses. Looking at it from a distance, it really has the appearance of "a long bridge lying on the waves, is it a dragon?" Such a beautiful scene is truly rare in the capital. It is a pity that it is the location of the agency, and the gate is heavily guarded, so outsiders have no way to visit.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Records of What I Saw and Heard in the Old Capital 銖菴 <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>

<p>Crickets A tiny cricket can be worth tens of gold. Stored in a jar of clear pulp and fed with crab meat and chestnut yellow food. Treasure it and raise it and wait for the time to fight. Losing money and wasting time, all for the sake of a pecking game. It can be seen that the extravagance of the ten tribes in the old capital is not limited to sensual pleasures, pearls, and jade. The Emperor's Capital Scenery says that the fighting of crickets began in July. There are fields for fighting and owners of the fields. There are also teachers to raise them. Every family is equipped with fighting pots and jars. Then we know that this custom was even more prevalent in the previous Ming Dynasty than it is today.</p>
<p>In the old capital, those who raise crickets for fighting, in addition to children in the alleys, are all wealthy families. Also, according to what is called the teacher of raising them, it is what is now called the "Bashi" in the northern customs. These people live by insects. After the White Dew season, one often sees those carrying cages with red [blank] on Chang'an Road. They are all feeding the Bashi.</p>
<p>The Records of Yanjing Seasons says that the people of the north call crickets "Guoguor" and crickets "Qukuor". After May in the northern capital, there are Guoguors selling along the streets. Each one costs only one or two coins. By October, there are those who sell them in stalls. Each one can be worth thousands. In mid-July, there are Qukuors. The expensive ones can be worth several gold coins. There are white hemp heads, yellow hemp heads, crab cheeks, blue pipa wings, plum blossom wings, and bamboo joint whiskers. It is because they are able to fight. By October, each one is only worth several hundred coins. It is taken for its call only. The Qukuor also has oil gourds. During the autumn season, one coin can buy more than ten. By October, one can be worth thousands of coins. It is because its sound is clear and continuous. Listening to it on winter nights is both sad and happy. It is truly a leisurely person's elegant pastime. Therefore, the Qukuor cans in autumn are of Yongle official kiln, Zhao Ziyu, Danyuanzhuren, Jingxuanzhuren, red pulp, and white pulp. The best ones cost dozens of gold coins a pair. The ones with thick and solid bindings are the best. They are the so-called gourd utensils. According to the Nikka Kyubunkou, Hujia Village, five miles outside Yongdingmen, produces good fighting crickets that are better than those from other places. Crickets are born in the fall. Their sound is merchant-like and their nature is competitive. The people of today's capital can cultivate them. They keep their calls deep in winter. The method is to plant them in pots with real soil. The insects are born in the soil. In winter, the soil is placed on a warm kang. Water is sprinkled on it every day and covered with cotton. They lie dormant for five or six days. They wriggle on top. After another seven or eight days, they are like maggots. Place vegetable leaves. Sprinkle and cover them again. The feet and wings are formed. Gradually they turn black. They call within a month. They are thinner than in autumn. They rebel in spring. The other types of crickets include oil gourds, which are fat and oily, those with large heads are called Bangzitou, and those with sharp beaks are called Laomizui, and so on. In the past, playboy princes had nothing to do, so they indulged in this and threw away huge sums of money without hesitation. Now there are few who like this. Only children in the alleys sometimes use it as a game. Also, the Yanjing Miscellaneous Records says that there are grass insects in the capital. They are shaped like crickets, fat and green. They are born between summer and autumn. The sound of chirping is very noisy. Many people in the capital keep them in cages and wear them. The best ones cost more than ten gold coins each. The cage is made of a small gourd with the top cut off. Flowers and birds are carved around the four sides to allow air to pass through. The craftsmanship is exquisite. The price can be as high as a hundred gold coins. Many Eight Banner Manchu women hollow out the soles of their shoes to put them in, so that the sound corresponds to the shoes. If they walk or stroll, they look like they are picking flowers. This custom is almost abolished now.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Record of a Certain Policeman <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Hongliu</p>
<p>My Cantonese friend, Mr. Zheng, once told me that he had heard that in a certain county public security bureau in Zhejiang, there was a policeman who was very clever. He had only received a few years of elementary school education, but he was very literate and had a remarkable writing style. His calligraphy was especially beautiful. In his spare time, he would borrow rubbings of inscriptions and practice his writing. The director of the bureau was surprised by this and promoted him to patrol leader. The policeman was even more diligent. His calligraphy improved even more and he broadened his horizons. Gradually, people began to ask for his calligraphy. After a few years, he was promoted to clerk. He could write documents in an instant. The policeman's income gradually increased. He began to buy more famous rubbings. His calligraphy became uniquely self-reliant. His name also gradually became famous. All the famous scholars in the county sought him out. This was only five or six years after he first became a policeman. Later, he was implicated in the communist affair and fled. After a few years, he secretly returned to his hometown, but he was too poor to support himself. So he made a living by selling his calligraphy. His career was at its peak. He could earn sixty or seventy gold coins a month. His family of several people relied on it to survive. Mr. Zheng described it like this, and also said that he had seen his calligraphy, which was indeed handsome and extraordinary. A policeman like this can also be said to have talent and be able to strive for success in hardship. However, with his talent, if he had met a powerful person who could promote him, there is no doubt that he would have been able to enter the ranks of scholars. But he only became known for his calligraphy, and I feel sorry for him. However, there are already many talented people in the world who are buried. But someone like this policeman was still able to make a living by his art, which is not unfortunate. Alas, it can be passed on.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Financial News Last Week: Major Turmoil in the Gold Market <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Rapid Storms and Utter Confusion</p>
<p>Once Approaching the 700 Taels Mark</p>
<p>Weekly High and Low Difference of Thirty-Nine and a Half Taels</p>
<p>Resulting in a Drop of Sixteen Taels and Seven Mace</p>
<p>Gold Transaction Volume Reached 23,000 Contracts</p>
<p>The Short Side in the Current Swap May Still Need to Pay Out</p>
<p>The past week saw violent fluctuations in the gold market. Ferocious waves ultimately proved impossible to suppress. The atmosphere within the market was exceptionally chaotic. Dealers were at a loss, bewildered and confused, advancing and retreating erratically. Daily fluctuations amounted to around ten taels. The momentum was unstoppable. Initially, overseas silver prices were reported to have fallen, but the large contracts unexpectedly rose, leading to a low opening at 741 taels and 3 mace. However, buyers were nimble. Moreover, due to the central bank absorbing cash, prices immediately surged, once reaching 48 taels and 5 mace. Subsequently, the silver market soared. The exchange rate loosened accordingly, with British gold exceeding one shilling and nine pence, and U.S. dollars also above thirty yuan. As gold prices repeatedly broke through multiple resistance levels, suffering heavy blows, the British and American exchange rates suddenly surged. It was rare for large contracts to experience such an astonishing surge. Consequently, a gloomy atmosphere pervaded the market, and sellers panicked. In the rapid storms, prices plummeted by over forty taels. On Thursday, the sudden drop brought prices to 709 taels. The following morning, the spot market even briefly crashed below the 700 tael mark (reaching 695 taels), which was truly unexpected. The bulls were greatly dismayed. Then, the silver market suddenly rebounded and contracted. Private telegrams and forward silver, along with exchange rates, continued to fall. Moreover, as the swap period approached, short sellers rushed to cover their positions, causing the market to turn from weak to strong, rebounding above 720 taels. The final settlement was 25 taels and 6 mace. Overall, compared to the previous Saturday, there was a further drop of 16 taels and 7 mace (a total drop of 22 taels and 3 mace over three weeks). The weekly high and low differential was 39 and a half taels, and the difference between the opening and closing prices was a drop of 15 taels and 7 mace. According to recent statistics, the total gold transaction volume was over 23,000 contracts, with short positions accounting for the majority, estimated at over 60 firms. However, Guangbang Hengxing made some covering purchases during the week, so its short position was relatively small, estimated at over 2,000 contracts. Furthermore, Dadecheng also had a short position of over 2,000 contracts. Zhaofengchang made successive covering purchases. The long side only accounted for over 20 firms, including major players like Mr. Wu, Jinyuanxingyong, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, and Runchangyu. Generally speaking, regarding future cash settlements, recently, red slips (receipts) initially added 8 taels and a half to the bid price. Later, due to the market price falling excessively, an additional 10 taels was added. As for the upcoming September/October swap, the short side may still need to pay out four or five taels. As for British and American silver prices, they have risen for three consecutive weeks, so the Shanghai market shilling repeatedly rose by one and a half notches (375), and the U.S. dollar by 625. Internally, the shilling also rose by 625, and the U.S. dollar by 8125 due to large exchange rate spreads. The gold firms initially sold and then bought back to offset previous short positions. However, the amount of short positions was estimated to reach four or five million yuan. As for exchange rates, both British and American rates have recovered by one point (reversing the small decline of the past two weeks). However, over six or seven days, the market seemed to be hovering without advancing. Yesterday (the 14th), the large contract silver price continued to be reported as falling. Today (the 15th), the gold market may still experience fluctuations. Moreover, dealers, as usual, privately engage in swap transactions one day early. The high and low prices of British and American silver markets and exchange rate bid prices are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e214">Securities News Last Week: Chaotic Situation in the Bond Market <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Sharp Fall at the Beginning of the Week, Followed by Gradual Rebound</p>
<p>Thin Market Conditions Continued, Extremely Scarce Transactions</p>
<p>Last week, the bond market conditions at the local Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange were extremely thin. The total turnover for the entire week was only 44,000 yuan, including 15,000 yuan for the 20th Year Customs Bonds, 11,000 yuan for the Consolidated Tax Bonds, 6,000 yuan for the 19th Year Customs Bonds, 4,000 yuan for the Disbandment Bonds, and 3,000 yuan each for the 20th Year Loan Bonds and the Consolidated Salt Tax Bonds. The remaining bonds, such as the Customs Bonds of 19th Year and the 96 Public Bonds, saw no trading. The futures market also remained sluggish. The market situation continued to lack vitality. All parties only saw sporadic trading. Among them, the August contract saw relatively active trading, while the September contract only opened on the last two days of the week, with a small volume. Looking at the daily transaction situation last week, Monday was the most active with approximately 4 million yuan. Thursday only saw 1.6 million yuan, and the remaining days averaged 2 million yuan. The total for the entire week was 15.46 million yuan, approximately 800,000 yuan more than the previous week. The salt tax accounted for 3.625 million yuan, including 3.55 million yuan for the August contract and 75,000 yuan for the September contract. The disbandment bonds accounted for 3.01 million yuan, including 2.97 million yuan for the August contract and 40,000 yuan for the September contract. The consolidated tax bonds accounted for 2.235 million yuan for the August contract and 5,000 yuan for the September contract. The 20th year loan bonds accounted for 1.32 million yuan for the August contract and 50,000 yuan for the September contract. The 20th year customs bonds accounted for 1.615 million yuan for the August contract and 25,000 yuan for the September contract. The 19th year customs bonds accounted for 1.435 million yuan for the August contract and 10,000 yuan for the September contract. The 19th year good cause bonds accounted for 980,000 yuan for the August contract and 15,000 yuan for the September contract. The Disbandment Bonds accounted for 645,000 yuan for the August contract and 5,000 yuan for the September contract. Furthermore, the customs bonds only saw a turnover of 170,000 yuan for the August contract, 85,000 yuan for the 96 Public Bonds, and 5,000 yuan for the financial bonds. The trend of various bonds was particularly chaotic. On Monday, due to Wang’s resignation, concerns about the situation in the north, and tensions with Japan, people were weak, and selling was active. As a result, prices uniformly fell sharply, with the Disbandment Bonds falling by 1.8 yuan, and the rest falling by 1 to 1.5 yuan. However, since then, the market has been extremely dull, and prices have remained very stagnant. Daily fluctuations have been minimal. However, the market saw that the central situation was gradually stabilizing, and there would be no further changes in the north. Moreover, diplomatic relations with Japan seemed to be under the auspices of the United States, creating a more favorable international situation. Therefore, although the market still did not see large buyers, some retail investors took advantage of the low current prices, believing that any further decline would be difficult to justify. As a result, they were quite willing to buy at low prices. As a result, buying transactions were often slightly more active than selling, and prices gradually firmed up. As a result, compared to the previous week, except for the August Disbandment Bonds, which rose by 1.45 yuan, and the spot 20th Year Loan Bonds and Consolidated Tax Bonds, which fell by over 1 yuan each, the other bonds saw mixed gains and losses, mostly in the range of only a few jiao. Now observing the situation in the bond market, it is becoming increasingly chaotic, and its future is difficult to predict. The changes in various prices are listed in the following table (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>7,682 Bales of Spot Yarn Sold to Customers</p>
<p>In the cotton yarn market, the beginning of last week saw sluggish purchases from customers with actual needs. All traders lacked enthusiasm. Moreover, the war clouds in the Northeast were spreading, with the Japanese army invading Jehol. The situation remained severe. Furthermore, Japanese yarn flooded the market in the north, with particularly low prices. Local yarn was heavily impacted. All sales were seized by Japanese merchants. As a result, Chinese yarn had to be transported to Shanghai to find a way out. Consequently, morale was extremely low. Unexpectedly, on Tuesday, the American cotton government released estimates, indicating a reduction in production. The market price surged by 85 points per pound. World morale was greatly shaken. Raw cotton soared, leading to a corresponding rise in the closely related yarn market. It presented a sudden and rapid upward trend. Short sellers reluctantly covered their positions. Subsequently, on Thursday and Friday, the market atmosphere weakened again. Although American cotton rose, silver prices surged, causing the market to level out. However, major traders, seeing that domestic factories had depleted their stockpiles and that the overseas cotton market was unlikely to fall, were very keen to go long. Another group, due to many rumors, leaned towards short selling. The future of the yarn market lacked certainty. The prices for various months of raw yarn rose by 2.7 to 3.78 taels compared to the previous week. Total transactions for the entire week were estimated at 226,400 bales. Among customer traders, those from the south and Sichuan continued to purchase the most, estimated at 7,682 bales. Market prices rose by 2 to 3 taels compared to the previous week. The purchase volume by various trader groups is listed below:</p>
<p>| Trader Group | Bale Volume | Trader Group | Bale Volume | Trader Group | Bale Volume |</p>
<p>| :----------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---------- |</p>

<p>Factories Have Slightly Increased Demand for Raw Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton market was relatively firm at the beginning of last week. Due to the depletion of local cotton stocks and the extreme drought and high heat waves affecting new cotton, with dry cotton fields in various regions, morale was high, and buying sentiment was strong. However, one manufacturer had already sold a significant amount of new cotton in the production area at low prices, making substantial gains in the futures cotton market, leading to a slight weakening of the market. Unexpectedly, on Tuesday, the American government released production figures that were much lower than expected, causing prices to soar by 85 points per pound. As a result, world morale was greatly shaken. Short sellers were generally disappointed and had to reluctantly cover their positions, causing the market to surge by one tael and two mace. Subsequently, on Thursday and Friday, silver prices soared, the gold market trended downwards, and exchange rates rose, causing profit-taking among buyers, slightly leveling out the market. On the weekend, American cotton fell back, and stocks fell sharply, causing the situation to suddenly become weak. However, the buying attitude remained strong, with buyers purchasing and adding to their positions on dips. Judging from the overall trend, the future of the cotton market is difficult to predict. The prices for various months of raw cotton rose by one tael and two mace compared to the previous week. Total transactions for the entire week were estimated at 744,200 dan. Factories have slightly increased demand for spot cotton. American cotton rose by 115 points per pound compared to the previous week. The purchase volume by various factories is listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to selling by Southern traders, but later firmed up due to buying by fellow traders and poor cotton harvest. Futures rose by 13 to 15 points per pound, and spot prices rose by 15 points per pound. British cotton futures fell by 8 or 9 points, and spot prices rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. Indian cotton initially fell slightly following American cotton, but later recovered due to short covering. Pingguoer rose by 2 rupees, Aomula fell by 2 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 0.75 rupees. Original telegram recorded left. (13th telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e220">An Example of a Traitor <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Fo</p>
<p>The notorious traitor Hu Lifu was used by the Japanese after the start of the Zhabei battle. In a moment of greed and blindness, he willingly became a traitor. When our army retreated to the second line of defense, he and his accomplices, Chang Yuqing, Feilong, Agen, and others, committed all sorts of evil deeds. The residents of Zhabei suffered greatly. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, a Japanese man named Hara San invited Hu to dinner, resulting in his arrest. What his crime is, the national law will naturally judge, so I don't need to say more.</p>
<p>However, according to Hu Lifu's confession, he has three sons, all of whom have noble professions. Now, due to his actions, they have all been dismissed from their jobs. He went to Xin Ya for dinner tonight, truly fooled by the Japanese Hara San, selling friends for money, and so on. But whether Hara San sold friends for money, I don't need to make a judgment before there is solid evidence. However, it is definitely true that his three sons, all of whom have noble professions, have been dismissed from their jobs because of his actions. As the saying goes, "One person's actions are one person's responsibility." If you become a traitor, the misfortune will not only affect yourself but also your descendants. If it is only a matter of a few bowls of rice, it is a small matter. Because Hu has already become a traitor, he naturally has the corresponding price of a traitor, so there is no need to worry too much. However, when others talk about it, it will always be "so-and-so's son, a traitor," "so-and-so's grandson, a traitor." This kind of loss of reputation is probably not just a matter of a few bowls of rice. This is an example of a traitor.</p>
<p>Pu Yi, Zheng Xiaoxu, and their ilk, with faces full of ambition, want to use the Japanese as a shield, dreaming their restoration dreams, talking at length about their history of using barbarians to control the Chinese, making excuses for their wrongdoing. Now, their beautiful dream should be waking up. Recently, the Japanese government also appointed Mutō to the position of Commander of the Kwantung Army. Political figures held a grand banquet for him. This move is completely to realize the unified plan of aggression. The good dreams of Pu Yi, Zheng Xiaoxu, and their ilk should wake up even more. But now, even if the good dreams wake up, it is too late. The title of traitor has already been put on, and no matter how much you use the water of the West River, you cannot wash it away. Even if you use scientific methods to wipe it, you cannot wipe it off. This is not enough to warn these few traitors. Their retribution is probably still to come. This is another example of a traitor.</p>
<p>But can such similar traitors be killed off, can they all die? I say, it is impossible to kill them all. Recently discovered traitors are like bamboo shoots after rain, flourishing. I have nothing else to say, only to ask them to pay attention and look at a few examples.</p>

<h3 id="e221">The Lower Half of a Beauty <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Rang Shui</p>
<p>There are many who sing of the beauty, but from the waist down, they are all hidden and the wonderfulness is not conveyed, which is a great pity. The Book of Songs, Beifeng, "Gathering Feng, Gathering Fei," has no mention of the lower body. Therefore, based on the meaning of the Book of Songs, I have supplemented and sung of it, so as to avoid the criticism of "the small man is successful."</p>
<p>How can the hidden parts be painted? In front, a small figure stands on the empty steps, her embroidered shoes fresh. She removes the restraints and moves her steps stealthily. She lingers, loving the roundness of her six-inch feet. How can she allow the dew to come late at night? She truly desires to step on the waves and ascend to heaven. What can be done if Shen Lang is now thin and frail? Gently, for fear of pressing down on the shoulder of the poem.</p>
<p>I imagine her clothes cannot be depicted. Only explore the fragrant grass to the waist of her skirt. The half-body of flowers and dew hangs down. Along the way, the fragrant wind is tender with every step. The green trees are ruthless, blocking the shadow. The red pomegranate bows down, desiring to lose its soul. Why should the lower body be left out like the feng and the fei? Only by gaining a confidante can loneliness be comforted.</p>

<h3 id="e223">What is Thunder? <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Hong</p>
<p>During summer and autumn, thunder rumbles loudly. The powerful thunder and lightning a few days ago were deafening. This magnificent celestial phenomenon often causes fear in ordinary people.</p>
<p>What exactly is thunder? Where does the thunder in the sky come from? If you want to understand these things, we must first talk about electricity. The electricity in the sky is the same as the electricity used in our ground-level electric lights and trams. This was proven 180 years ago (i.e., 1752) by an American named Benjamin Franklin. He used a kite to draw electricity from the sky, causing lightning. This was a very dangerous experiment; a mistake could lead to being struck by lightning.</p>
<p>Now, what we need to know is: where does the electricity in the sky come from? Electricity comes from raindrops. Lightning and thunder only occur during rainstorms, as everyone can see. Before a thunderstorm, there is often a type of cloud in the sky, its bottom dark black, its top rising in jagged peaks, like mountains. Later, the cloud peaks suddenly collapse, and thunder rumbles. At this time, the updraft in the sky (i.e., air flowing upwards from the ground) is extremely strong. When raindrops fall from high altitudes, they are broken by this extremely strong updraft, turning back into fine water droplets and rising to form clouds. The clouds encounter cold at high altitudes and re-condense into large raindrops, which are then broken again by the updraft. In this way, after being repeated hundreds and thousands of times, the raindrops carry a large amount of positive electricity, while the air carrying negative electricity rises to the upper part of the clouds. Positive and negative electricity are continuously separated. Eventually, positive electricity accumulates more and more, and negative electricity accumulates more and more. At last, the force of attraction between them becomes extremely strong. When the air can no longer serve as insulation, that is, when the resistance of the air is limited and cannot resist the attractive force between the positive and negative electricity, then the positive and negative electricity break through the air separating them and make contact. At the point of contact, flashing electric light is emitted, commonly called lightning, and scientifically referred to as "lightning."</p>
<p>At the place where positive and negative electricity attract each other and cause discharge, a large amount of heat is released. At this time, the air in this part expands rapidly due to the large amount of heat and rises almost into a vacuum. Therefore, the surrounding cold air rushes into the vacuum with extremely great speed. Consequently, the collision of air with air produces a huge sound, which is the thunder we hear.</p>
<p>By the time the sound of thunder reaches our ears, the danger has already passed. This is because light travels faster than sound. Sound travels at an average speed of only 340 meters per second. If you count the time it takes to hear thunder after seeing lightning, you can calculate how far away the lightning is from your location.</p>
<p>Discharge between clouds in the sky is less dangerous. If discharge occurs between clouds and the ground, it is very dangerous, and people, animals, trees, and houses can be destroyed upon contact. During a heavy thunderstorm, it is best to avoid lightning by staying away from large trees, electric poles, and high walls. It is especially not advisable to stand in damp places or get completely wet, as these are all easy conductors of electricity and are very dangerous.</p>

<h3 id="e224">An Afternoon at the City God Temple <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>The City God Temple... is a bustling area of Shanghai. Strangers visiting Shanghai always want to stroll around here and buy some things. If they don't, it seems like they've failed their mission to Shanghai. So the City God Temple is not only a place for strangers to visit but also a marketplace for Shanghainese!</p>
<p>On an afternoon when the scorching sun has subsided slightly, tourists, shoppers, and incense burners crowd together, replacing the air of the City God Temple with a tense, noisy atmosphere.</p>
<p>There are many shops selling foreign jadeite jewelry, which are promoters of foreign goods and, of course... the only good friends of modern women, aren't they? They are all surrounding the foreign jadeite jewelry shops!</p>
<p>Ding-dong, ding-dong... ringing continuously, suppressing all faint sounds and piercing people's eardrums. Ah! This is the peep show attracting customers! The Huxinting Teahouse... is one of the best scenic spots in the City God Temple. Turtles and fish under the Nine-Bend Bridge swim on the surface of the water, rippled by the cool breeze, occasionally raising their heads to breathe air, enticing people standing on the bridge to watch their naturalness and happiness. Unfortunately... a urinal has been set up next to the Huxinting Teahouse, and a foul smell is transmitted everywhere, like the stinky disinfectant used to prevent epidemics.</p>
<p>The Ten Kings of Hell! Constellations! City God! Everything, everything is filled with mystery. This is the unique art of our country, isn't it! "Sir! Madam! Would you like incense and candles?" Waves of annoying voices pass by the ears.</p>
<p>"Your complexion is very good! How old are you this year?..." When people walk to the fortune teller's place, they can always hear this kind of voice!</p>
