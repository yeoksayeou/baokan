<p>日本恃其武力。蔑視際信義。毁壞國際公約。自以爲聰明絕世。旣用「非常時期」之名。愚弄其國民。復借「武裝自衛。」實行其對華侵略。自以爲氣呑一世到處横行也。然而其國内情形則何如自年十二月十三第二次實行禁止金輸岀以來。日本國内所存現金逐月减少。迄乎上月底。僅有現金四億二千萬圓日。金乃施行通貨膨脹政策結果。日本銀行所發行之紙幣。</p>
<p>幾增加一萬萬圓日金。一般特價激劇增高。（據日本銀行調查）批發物價指數。</p>
<p>一九三二年一月爲一五九·五四月爲一五四·一　　一九三二年七月爲一四七·七九月爲一六七·四　　一九三二年十月爲一六九·一十一月爲一七六·九</p>
<p>物價旣已逐漸上漲。市面應日趨繁榮。在普通理論之推究。似無疑義。而日本當局亦正以此自豪。以爲英美法德各國受世界經濟恐慌之影響。皆未能自拔最多亦不過初見底止漸有轉機已耳。日本則扶搖直上。市面之繁榮。指顧可其矣然而事實之昭示。先就農業而論。占全人百分之五十一之農。民其收入百分之六十五以至七。十均在乎白米與蠶。繭三四年來成續均不見佳。一九三○年之豐收成災一九三一年之欠收恐慌。今年米穀價格亦未見好。春蠶正値生絲跌落。夏秋蠶繭收入。雖得略展愁。眉而其市價。較之一九二九年之時。則僅及二分之一。農民負債旣無法清償。更何有餘力以培飬土地。增加不足償付元本之岀產耶。至於城市工人及因工資養活之人口數在一。</p>
<p>千六七百萬。因物價高漲。其所得之利益幾何。其消費能力是否加高。皆爲當前之主要問題。其工人就職率與工資指數如次。</p>
<h3 id="c29">工作人員率實收工資率 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>一九三二年上半期平均七三·八八八·○　　一九三二年七月七四·五八六·二　　一九三二年八月七四·七八六·一　　據上列簡單數字。即知日本工人之就職者雖略增加。而實收工資。則反見低落加以物價上漲二者相形之下。生活之困苦。已可由此簡單之數字表之矣。是故社會之不安。人心之惶惑。縱使攻城掠地亦何所補於其傾危之局。更有甚者。今年八月以至十一月底。郵政儲金激據减少。達於一萬四千四百萬圓日金之巨迄乎本月僅十日之間。即已減低一千六百餘萬。設至年底。恐將再行減少至一萬七八千萬圓日金矣。因儲金之減少。故其預定放欵計劃乃至無法實行。如不動產通融放欵。原擬一萬萬圓日金。現僅能借岀一千萬。信用組合爲使固定資金流動化之預定放欵三千萬。現在實際放岀。亦僅一千萬圓而新近請求借貸之北海道災害復與資金。與肥料借貸等。其　當在三萬萬日金以上如此巨額資金。就日本目前金融情勢。捨添發不兌換紙幣而外。何從應付。</p>
<p>以實情而論如再行通貨膨脹。增發一兩萬萬紙幣。尙屬可能。然現金準備過於薄弱。對外匯兌。將更低落輸岀固有莫大便利。對產對界刺激。將收良好效果。惟輸入方面無論爲美棉爲印棉。皆將感受重大之打擊也。德意志之覆轍可鑑。財政的破敗堪虞。</p>
<p>况日本國庫空虚。侵略不已。經旣乏來路。市塲又復榨小。軍費之急。有如星火。人民之窮殆似枯魚。是以在經濟走頭無路之中。乃有尋「金」若狂之舉。有人謂台灣山中富有藏金。於是日本政府以至實業界。均專派人員前往調查輾轉一年。迄無所發現。近者復又生奇想。撈取海底某俄艦沉沒時所載之「黃金。」且已組織尋金公司。欲發此一筆横財。對黒龍江之金礦與夫北海道某處之探尋尤著狂熱。日本自謂爲世界之强者。乃欲僥倖發財。以度其當前之財政　關借補其侵略費用。縱使黃金如鐵。亦豈能塡滿鎗口。　殺我中國人民。以彈丸補平我土地耶。</p>
<p>須知華人固甘心作人奴隷。自救之志。未嘗或忘。百年爭鬥。今方開始。殊死之戰。尙在將來。而日人已捉襟見肘。遍覓「黃金」以濟其危。吾人能不努力奮發。以打破此黷武惡魔之黃夢。</p>

<p>羅斯福明年三月以後就是白宮的主人、各處官衙又另換一般新人物、以農民爲基礎、以三Ｋ黨爲活力的民主黨、復起執政、究竟何如、現在還不敢懸斷、而現任總統、雖不能十分堅持他所主張的政策可是他却非常注意善後工作、特别是顧全銀行家的利益、留著好感、爲共和黨將來留餘地、雖然、胡佛總統到處宣傳、說「經濟恐慌」已漸次過去、好的市面、就快要到來、不過他還是警式不懈、例如富庶的紐約州、天天都在請求如何救濟窮乏、豈但效力微小、并且連州政府的薪水也要發放不出、聯邦政府打算對於一切商品、（除了糧食以外）都要課以販賣稅、恐怕僅止加稅、還不能求得預算的平衡、所以還要更進一步减低聯邦官吏薪俸、據說要减削薪俸百分之十一、遍地黃金的國家、在我們未到美國前的假想、現在他一般人民的困苦、較之被岸的祖國、縱然好些、面物質享受高、突然由减薪而至於失業、這是何等的恐慌景象、</p>
<p>本年六月底、是財政年度終了的時期、綜計一年來因恐慌而借的欵、竟有三十三萬萬美金、丨其中有財政部期票六萬一千五百六十萬美金、財部證劵二萬七千二百五十萬美金、到本年九月滿期的證劵、有七萬一千二百萬美金因爲在市塲上有各種條件足供处用、（例如遊資過多投資沒有地方）、所以政府發行公僨、有非常的便利、所以發行利息、一厘二毫五的四萬萬美金證金之外、還發行五年期利息三厘二毫五的七萬五千萬美金期票、竟於短時期内應募的數目、乃超過七倍、最近時間内到了期的短期借欵、其數目如下、</p>
<p>滿期時日種類金額利率</p>
<p>千美金</p>
<p>一九三二年十月十五日證劵三三·三０三·二五％　　千美金</p>
<p>一九三二年十二月五日期票六００·三０三·二五　　千美金</p>
<p>一九三三年三月十五日證劵六六０·七０三·七五這些短期借欵要換成長期或中期、只要利息不在百分之三以下、都是很容易的事公債雖然逐年增加、徴募公債雖然很容易、可是租稅收入减低、表明產業衰退、即使能夠增加公債、也不是什麽好現像、</p>
<p>民主黨的對東洋政策、特别是我們身居他國裏的中國人、尤其注意、民主黨裏面、確有一部分人主張和平、主張對日讓步、主張修正移民法案、撤廢對日本的差别待遇、大西洋艦隊歸回原隊、但還是主張」門户開放一、并不放棄東方市塲、對菲律濱獨立問題、在民主黨中、也有兩派不同的見解、一派是以爲卡丁提案八年後准許菲利濱獨立時間太長、應該在今後四十個月内就允許菲島獨立、一則是符合民主黨歷來的主張、二則借此取得英國的好感、拆散英日之間的聯盟關係、在表面上固然要撑出美國國旗之下、而不許海外　領地自由獨立、是和美國素常所持的主義與理想相反、所以准許菲利濱獨立、勢在必行、在另一方面、則以爲美國議會、沒有允許菲島獨立的權限、因爲聯邦憲法、并不曾把這種權限給予國會、所以允許菲利濱獨立的權限、是在美國全體人民、如果議會要允許菲島獨立、除非先行修改憲法、否則議會是無權通過這一案件的、并且主張菲島獨立的一派、也并沒有主張放棄在菲島軍備的特設權、美國人雖多數厭戰、但對於商業和投資的利益、却不肯放鬆、</p>
<p>即以對歐洲戰債而論、在財政的損失上、在其和黨對金融資本家的信用上、是不能不强硬的索討、而在商業的利益、在工業製品對歐洲的銷路、如果强迫改回資金、則歐洲的市面、將越見衰頽、美國的經濟恐慌、更不容易恢復、縱然號稱運用資本能手的美國銀行家、也不能不希圖近利、大槪還是堅决的討債、討回歐洲十二月十五到期的二萬七千餘萬美金的戰債、是否能夠討足、當然是問題、并且他也不管將來如何、現在總是要盡力的催討、就華盛頓的人看、總以爲是可以討得到的、（一九三二年十一月十八日於華盛頓）</p>

<p>漁業局誤會福海福海輪誤會海軍漁局又誤會海軍此案正在交涉中</p>
<p>實業部江浙區海洋漁業管理局福海巡艦前日與海軍發生誤會、開槍射擊一事、昨日海軍士兵、業已撤回、而造船所方面、昨已函致該局交涉、茲再誌詳情如次、</p>
<h3 id="c104">海軍撤回 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>自前日福海巡艦向海軍開槍後、海軍江南江康兩小輪、即駛近大通碼頭、海軍當局、爲判明是非責任起見、及避免事態擴大、惹起意外糾紛計、特於前日深夜、令將該兩小輪上衛兵、一律撤回、威勝亦停止出動、故昨日形勢、已較和緩、</p>
<h3 id="c105">衝突原因 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>查前日衝突原因、全屬誤會、且殊複雜、蓋漁業局共有慶安·海膺·表海·福海·四巡艦、均在外海護漁、福海艦則於月前、亦在定海、保護漁船、該局日前應本埠永豐冰鮮公所之請、允調福海艦、保護該公所海面冰鮮、故當即軍飭該艦駛滬、惟時適該艦在嵊山定海間護漁、一時不克駛返、後經該局代理局長周秉逵氏、親自赴定海、晤該艦艦長郭威、命即駛滬、並商給發給該艦糧餉、諸事完竣後、周氏乃先行返滬、</p>
<h3 id="c106">遲延來滬 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>福海艦於周氏離定海後、仍從事該處護漁工作、（該艦海商立有條約、言定保護時期、未滿期時、不能另護其他漁輪、）及至福海擬返時、忽有「大對」漁商報告、沈家行海面漁船被刦、請該艦進剿、該艦長以勢難不理、遂將該艦駛并沈家門剿匪、並函告滬局知照、中間因剿匪時間、不無躭擱、遲至本月十四日、始行抵滬、下椗於南市江橋浦中、</p>
<h3 id="c107">漁局震怒 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>漁業局方面、以該艦迭經電飭開滬、仍遲遲其行、稽延時日、致該局前允永豐冰鮮公所派艦保護一層、因時期延悮、該所方面、業已另行請艦保護、故對該艦行　延緩、藐視局令、頗爲震怒、</p>
<h3 id="c108">誤會遂起 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>同時盛傳、該局方面、因該艦藐視局令之故、將請海軍追獲該艦、將其繳械、故該艦抵滬後、心中不免志忐忑、而適於前日、海軍方面、派員隨帶衛兵、赴該艦交涉欠欵、致該艦方面、更信以爲眞、係來繳械、故頗形恐慌、於是遂發生誤會、開槍射擊、險釀重大事件、</p>
<h3 id="c109">赴局報告 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>當前日該艦與海軍方面發生衝突後、時漁業局定海辦事處主任王志良（現在滬）得悉、因未明眞相、特至該局面謁周代局長報告云、有灰色輪二、滿載士兵至福海艦繳械、是否爲局長所派、周氏當時、以本人並無此項命令、深爲詫異、當詢有無公文、如無公文、應即抵抗云、</p>
<h3 id="c110">嚴重交涉 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>當王主任向周代局長報告時、已在福海艦開放一槍之後、海軍方面、以該艦舉動奇突、亦不便再行登輪、免再發生他故、當時立即退至他處、當晚即行奉命撤回、嚴重之形勢頓止、昨日、海軍當局、以該艦係漁業局所有、所欠之欵、迭經向該局催討、迄無答復、而派員至該艦上交涉、竟不問情由、開槍射擊尤屬無理、故昨日上午、雖爲星期日、而副所長陳藻藩氏、仍到所辦公、並令該所秘書繕函送致該局、嚴重交涉、如仍無效果、當採有効辦法、該函當即於昨日用海軍部江南造船所名義發出、</p>
<h3 id="c111">漁局表示 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>據漁業局方面向華東社記者表示、以所欠之欵、早已呈請實業部轉咨財政部撥付、惟至今尙未領到、該局經費、旣極困難、故該所現欵、更無法籌措、即該局目前職員薪水、尙係向實部借到數千元發給、故至今此欵無力償還、在該局處此環境之下、實屬無可奈何、且所欠各欵、除江南造船所外、年前該局海鷹巡艦、向求新廠修理各費、迄今亦無法清償云、</p>

<p>全綫距離全線路程、爲七百英里弱、計四站、上海·海州·青島·天津·自上海至海州、二百七十英里、海州至青島一百五十英里、青島至天津二百七十英里、將來沿線飛行次數、每星期内可暫往返三次、然後再視飛行成績而增加、</p>

<p>售藥廣告顯然侵害自訴人之人格權、查人格權中以自由權及姓名權爲最重、該廠經理竟悍然不顧、將自訴人之肖像姓名、作該廠賣藥幌子廣告、以欺騙世人、欲遂其不當得利之慾望、人必疑自訴人受該廠不法利益、故肯將自己姓名照片允許該廠作</p>

<p>翁君訊··我今年三十一歲、現在小學裏頭做校長，年俸不及三百元！除供給一個妻子，兩個小女兒外，還要奉養兩個老母，連四個小弟弟。年來做事又不如意，以致欠人債欵，果積有三千餘元·現在年關將屆，索債的人，門限爲穿，幾次想欲自殺，以了人世。怎奈父子幼，頓覺不安心！在這進退維谷的時候，懇求先生代我做一個完滿解决的答復，使我能得一線的生機，先生功德眞無量了！</p>
<p>覆，足下收入徴薄，而負担繁重，此種困難，我們深表同情。而且此種困難，所感受者，亦僅足下個人，通國之内，十居七八。我們收到此類訴說經濟困難信件，每日極多，此實爲整個社會問題，决難個别救濟。所以足下來信，要我們作一個完滿的答復，辦法未嘗沒有，不過說來話長，而結果還是不有救足下「一時之急」的，當前我們所能夠貢獻於足下的，祇有「忍耐應付」四字而已。依我們想，欠債並不犯法，像足下的負債，旣非由於自己之荒唐，社會更該原諒，如社會竟不原諒，那末你儘管挺着一個光身子，由社會隨便怎樣去咒駡好了，人家總不會一口將你吞了肚子的，你又怕些什麽呢？怕將來沒有飯吃嗎？假使「校長」做不成，一家老小都可以做工去，只要吃得苦，總不會餓死丨如足下以爲做工是丢臉的事，那是你自己思想在墮落，我們是沒有辦法的了。至於足下說要『自殺」，更是笑話，你活在世上，你該問社會要飯吃，自殺幹什麽？</p>
<p>黃籛君訉··我是一個二十歲的青年，因爲境遇艱困，所以只在初中學業，在三年前承蒙親戚介紹出來做事，現在因在服務中觀察所得，很需要高深的學議，想繼續進學校去求學，免得將來缺乏出路，可是徴求親友的意見，表同情的極少，爲事前妥愼慮起見　　得不求先生指敎，我親友的意見，大抵可慨括種；「　書有什麽用呢！現在一般大學生不是很多找不到職業嗎，目前還不是有勢力的能爭到飯！」富於閱歴的同事和年長者都是這様說，「現在沒有眞正可以讀書的學校，還是公餘自修或補習的好，要知道我們無處不可學，校不過求學方式之一，」這是一位親戚很懇切的對我說，他們說得都很有理由，一方面我也覺得現在學校所學的不適社會需要，棄了位置又可惜，因此使我猶豫了！但是過此以後，恐怕再沒有求學的機會，使我煩悶到　分！先生··我的境遇是困苦的，上面已經提過，家庭爲我初中求學所負的債才了清，現在不過積餘可些可供二年求學的費用，如果我再求學，那末仍須告貸，負債當然更大了！敬愛的先生，在我這樣的環境，繼續去求學呢？還是工餘補習？我們青年應該怎樣努力學識，才能達到事業成功的境地？末了！我盼望着你剴功的賜敎，便於迅速的决定途徑，無任企感，</p>
<p>覆，足下有志學問，深堪敬佩！來信所陳二說，後一說是很對的。足下家庭經濟狀况，旣如此拮据，繼續入校求學，事實上確有困難，自以業餘自修爲宜。要知一人果有眞實學問，出身如可，全然無關，足下不必煩悶也。</p>
<p>林丹池君訊··我於十八人歲時，已經成了一個舊禮敎的婚姻制度下底一個犧牲者了。談婚時，我曾堅决反抗，不消說，那反抗無效的。於是我只得聴天由命，希望天老爺憐恤一下，賜給我一個好妻人！天曉得他是一個毫沒希望的，於是同居不兩夜，我們的對抗壁壘已經築得牢固了。結婚後丨第二天丨晚上，我就談起離婚的事來，這他是不當爲問題的，因爲他有了一我不是平白跟爾來的，我是大迎大娶回來的。一這兩名話做靠山了，他便可以恣意表揚他的劣跡了。他到底是怎樣的一個人呢？我自知癩蝦蟆不敢望天鵝肉，不過像他這樣的女人，實在是望之生畏，誠不能再有所委屈了。他沒有讀過書，生得一身壞癖氣，言詞異常突兀的，不三言兩語，便要和你閙雷臺，至於面貌那是不能談到的了。我只得採用消極的手段，和他疏遠了四年多。現在，我只有和他離婚，而他始終是不同意，老母也是不願的。但是要顧慮到他們兩者之中的一個人的意思和利益時，我個人的幸福前途完全斷送了，我是絕對辦不至的，這有甚麽辦法呢？這裏我要問··對方不自意時，可否單方面自動向法庭提出離異或自同登報聲明脫離關係？過去的强迫結婚，現在可否宣佈無效呢··此事諸問題未解决前，可否和另一女子發生愛的關係或談到婚姻問題呢？談起來時，我家庭的情形應該明白告訴他呢還是暫時保守秘密呢？必要時可否宣佈脫離家庭關係作一個總解决呢？</p>
<p>覆··婚姻不自由，確是現代青年大多數所感受到的一種痛苦。如來信所述情形是實，自以離婚爲是。惟離婚須經一定法律手續，一方登報聲明脫離關係，是不生效的，最好自然是雙方協議離婚，若一方不同意，那就非經法院判决不可。查照現行民法一零五二條規定，離婚須具備一定條件，故就法律而言，目下的離婚，尙未能說絕對自由，關於此點，足下起訴法院時，須自已斟酌辦理。又在夫妻關係未脫離前，不能另與他人結婚，否則即搆成重婚罪，萬不可嘗試。。</p>

<p>（四）在學年中間更張徒滋紛擾</p>
<p>這是一個事實問題、敎師時間的支配、課表的排列、課的選探、部須經過相當時期的準備通常總在第一學期開始前、準備一學年的工作在第二學期開始時、祇能有細小的更動、現在把舊章程澈底推翻、一切無所根據、各校須重訂新章程、規定過渡時代的辦法辭退一部分舊敎師、聘請新敎師、訂定新課表、選擇新敎本、這許多事都不能咄嗟立辦、這其間學校的損失與學生的損失、不知道要多少、此中情形、凡稍有學校行政經騐的人都知道、不必細說、</p>
<p>（五）所規定的中學敎職員服務時數太近理想按照敎部新頒辦法、中等學校專任敎員除擔負訓育責任及課外自修指導外、每週所任敎學時數初中爲二十二至二十六小時高中爲二十至二十四小時、如有特殊情形、尙須酌量增加、職員擔任敎學以專任敎員時敎學時間爲準、最低限度、校長不得少於二分之一、敎務事務訓育主任各不得少於三分二、經騐告訴我們、這個標準是所不通的美國的中學敎員、平均擔任二十一二小時一星期、日本的中學敎師、平均擔任十九小時、照我國的經騐、負責原敎師、（當然敎部希望個個敎員部負責）、每週擔任十八小時至二十小時、最爲適宜敎師擔任這許多時間外、再參加些課外工作、已經夠忙了、如須他們擔任訓育職務及自修導、每週須得酌减二三小時、我們知道每授課一時、課前準備與課後處理、最低限度、非一二小時不可（時問再少、書决計敎不好）、所以擔任二十小時的課、再加參與在課外作業的時間、再加準備及處理的時間、已須在五十小時以外了、若照敎部的規定、少說些、各敎師每週須做到八十小時以外的工作、否則祇能在課室内照書本購、什麽準備·練習·看筆記·改作文·閱試卷等、都不能理會校長·敎務主任·訓育主任·照我們的經騐、每週至多能擔任八九小時的功課、再多就要妨碍職務了、</p>
<p>記得羅素在敎育與所新時代ducationandToemodernWorld一書中說、一個青年、有求知的欲望、欲望的消滅、大半因爲給他們的知識超過了他們的需要和容量、猶之兒童都喜歡食物、但是一經强迫便發生一種不歡迎的態度了、」我們希望敎部頒布的課表、要顧到青年的能力、顧到表年的與趣、不要供給他們所不能容受的知識、不要强迫他們學習不甚喜歡的功課、「兒童第一須當作兒童看待、第二纔當作學生看待、」知識固然重要、其他方面或者同様的重要、我們更希望敎部顧到敎職員的能力和興趣、敎育是精神事業、要提高敎識員的精神、須用他　有效的方法、不能强迫加重、他們的工作、中國的敎育、好像一朶未開放的花、飽受了風雨的摧殘、暴露着若困頓的狀態、惟有希望敎部做個護花使者、着意栽培、不再做揠苗助長的事、那朶奄奄待盡的花、或者重能披雲見日、捐芬吐艶、吸收自由的空氣、（完）</p>

<p>▲復邦交球塲聯歡中俄邦交恢復聲中、上海萬國足球初賽、中俄兩足球隊、正於其時、相逢棒球塲、握手聯歡、另有一番氣象、俄人作壁上觀者甚多、與國人雜坐其間、互談藝、猶如久闊重逢者、中華先負一球、論者謂其盡地主之誼、迨至後來、中華如入無人之境、力圖發展射擊果能準確、何至僅以七對二占勝、或者勝利止的已達、多與寡同耳</p>
<p>▲好男兒爲國宣勞俄羅斯之非我敵、早在意中、七對二比、事勢使然、昨日中華陣線、克彼俄國、游刄有餘、十一戰將、堪稱英勇久戰之士、前鋒五虎、幾各有建設、右部較左尤佳、聯絡故耳、中衛線悉數參加前鋒、進攻力量則厚矣但、有時不免與内衛距離過遠、每逢敵來、返救不及、内衛江顧相輔甚力、守門陸鍾恩、稱職無愧、所失兩球、非渠之過、</p>

<p>柯拉沙一舉驚人　葡萄牙上場聲勢甚盛、屢屢威逼英軍、英格蘭雖擁有極盛之軍容、亦忙於應付、迨二十五分鐘時、萄軍左翼高山夫帶球直進斜起一脚、愛墨治捉而未得、復落門前、中鋒柯拉　　新產生之海星女子籃球隊（啓昌攝）</p>
<p>女子籃球健將陳英瑞郭筱萍汪香瀛關柳珠女士等、新組織海星女子籃球隊、延孔廣益爲敎練、昨晚初露身手、大勝國光於球濟東北難民游藝會表演賽中、</p>
<p>沙趕上射門、飛入網去葡萄牙先開紀錄、驚喜各有、</p>
<p>小馬賽還看顏色　第一球中後之七分鐘、英軍回攻至葡萄牙門前、西捕之少年新將左翼馬賽、活躍異常、在左角遠射葡門、守門克羅士以爲球落門後、不知球適過克之頭頂而徐徐落入門内、英格蘭因此成一比一與葡軍平手、其後葡軍雖有機會、皆不能利用、否則英軍已成敗將、上半時一比一和局</p>
<p>又二球成三比一　後局開始、英軍大振　全力猛撲葡萄牙之門、僅數分鐘、正圍攻葡門時、英軍忽得罰十二碼機會、軋許一掃中之、英格蘭遂以二比一佔勝又士一分鐘、左翼馬賽重復進襲萄軍、依様葫蘆‘過守門頭頂而飛入門内、從此英軍以三比一獲勝以至終局、</p>
<p>英葡兩軍之表演　英格蘭之中線及後衛線、最爲堅强前鋒之中以兩翼最活動德飛與巴爾敦較呆葡萄牙不能上半時盛勢之下獲勝、知其將敗、守門風頭甚　、其他以谷史泰之中堅及柯拉沙之中鋒、老將不滅威風、在葡軍中雞導鶴立、惜柯無人輔佐、孤掌難鳴、亦憾事也、</p>

<p>蘇格蘭以八比零淘汰猶太、猶太不如從前、此組全爲一面傾之形勢、一任蘇軍縱柄、幸守門穩健得救出險球不少、否則比數不止此、</p>
<p>上半時二球　蘇格蘭全力進攻、時失機會、而猶太之守門、大顯其矯健身手、改效殊少、、直至二十分鐘後、左翼休士在角上之一送、克拉格才一頂而開紀　、中球之後三分鐘、白克斯德傳中、守門衝出門外、傑克一撥而入、上半時蘇格蘭二比零勝、</p>

<p>㈠弁言</p>
<p>偌大一個上海市。商業之盛。户口之繁。非特是中國首埠。也就算東亞名城。。疾病爲人生所不免。醫藥乃日常所必需。當然値得一番討論。本篇公諸社會的意義。原是求大衆對於上海市醫藥。有確切的認識。方始可以合力來改進。推而至於全國。亦未嘗不可以上海爲表率。但是在未入正文以前。却有下列幾項聲明。</p>
<p>（甲）作者是個新醫（通稱西醫）。自然站在科學的立塲上說話。但是對於舊醫（俗稱中醫又稱國醫）。却並不施以攻擊。如果有「反科學天性」的人看了生氣。那就不管了。而文中有比擬借喻之處。亦是求其醒豁動聽。並沒什麽輕侮的意思。忠言逆耳。識者須要體諒我的苦心。</p>
<p>（乙）作者於同道絕少恩怨，不過秉性不求自利。立言未免　直。本文對於任何方面。沒有絲毫作用。文中所記。皆有事實可證。絕非向壁虚搆。</p>
<p>（丙）作者本人。在滬開業之外。向來好管團體的公共的閒事。如醫會、醫校、醫院、之類。所以自問對於社會與醫藥的關係。似乎有比較概括的認識。所以本題呌作島瞰。却並無傲慢自居。俯視一切的意思。</p>
<p>（丁）作者入世執業。不過十二年。所以只叙十年來情形。恰巧近十年來。醫藥界的光怪陸離也最甚。文中雖則併談醫藥。而對於醫學界不敢多所論列。還守着半個門外漢的態度。</p>
<p>（戊）爲求明瞭起見。文中夾以幾何畫的圖表一頁。（見下續）。讀者倘若細閱一過。也就可以鳥瞰上海的醫藥了。</p>
<p>（己）本文雖則統談醫藥。但亦酌量分别門類。列爲㈠醫藥學說的情形。㈡醫藥業務的情形。㈢醫藥政治的情形。㈣結論。</p>
<p>（庚）本篇雖登入申報。却是我個人的見解。並沒代申報發議論。一切　賣任是作者負的。</p>
<p>㈡學說之情形（新舊醫的紛爭）新醫流入中國。起初由外國敎士傳進來的。那時候外國的醫學就未十分發達。中國的西醫數目很少。可以說是點綴品而已。故此沒不新舊的爭執。自從各國在近五十年來。大提倡醫學。並且確有造福全世界的發明。加之我國的留學生。一批一批回國。新學輸入不已。我國的政體一天一天革新。於是新舊學說的紛爭當然不免。而尤以近十年爲最。其實社會上須要認清。新醫喚醒舊醫。乃是受世界科學潮流的激蕩。决人是黨同伐異謀少數人的衣食業務。並且其他學說如政治法律經濟建築工程。器物製造。大家都喜從新潮流上改進。沒有異議。何以醫學。就在例外呢。實在不解。依我個人想起來。大概因爲我國對於醫的一字。極少重觀。極少提倡。拿來混在醫卜星相四字中間。旣不爲執政者所措意。遂造成民間的糾紛。</p>
<p>新舊醫的爭點。在斷病的醫學。而不在治病的藥物。恐怕社會上還有許多人。囫圇呑棗。只當你們攘生意。要知道藥物。本是草根樹皮礦質鹽類。原沒有中外之分。儘可應用。而况我國藥物中富有寳藏。新醫從未一筆抺煞。並且從事研究。也有好多告成功的。如麻黃當歸之類。但是因爲國内科學不發達。這種事都呌外國人越俎代謀而去。現在當歸出口。每年不在少數。但聞德國已在種植。大約若干年後。國藥舗必然要進德國貨又肥又好的當歸了。舊醫一定要說。中國藥品。非用陰陽五行六氣的診斷去使用他。不能得效果。那就是新醫所萬不能承認之處。（而批評新醫的話。還是拿五十年前西醫對現在的西醫。如何能雙方不爭）將來勢必我們的藥物特長。都被外國人搜括了去。除却金針煎湯。那些「醫者意也」的方法。外國人却不要的。</p>
<p>舊醫的守醫。還是拿保存國藥來立論。什麽提倡國貨咧。杜塞漏巵都是那些片面的話咧。各位如果拿海關册子來查一查。可以知道每年西洋參、丁香、冰片、西黃、的進口是多少。新醫所用藥品是多少。以全上海市而論。每一個熱鬧胡同口。止少有一家國藥舗。和一家當舗。一則表現國藥鬯銷。一則表現經濟落後。講至研究國藥。改良藥產。原是化學家。藥物學家。植物學家的事。若依舊法整理。也得到產藥之區去工作。决不是國藥舗門口。裝一排「年紅電燈」。標一名代客煎藥。就算科學化了。</p>
<p>如今科學人材尙缺。國藥的整理狠難。而舊醫說道。「我們已經把國藥科學化了」。這一來把眞科學　諸門外。於是成立許多野狐禪。硬說把電氣裝入人參膠裏去。做什麽含電人參膠。閙成空前的笑話。</p>
<p>舊的頗肯標新。新的不便復舊。故而社會上人。認爲攻守異殊。輿論未免偏向於舊。這也是人之常情。然而不肖之徒。未免借標新的方法。博同情於社會。實施其新舊兩用的伎倆。其實我們知道。新舊學理。尙在相爭的時代。决不是新舊術可以並施的時期。（諸君讀了本文以後。或者對於新醫的大聲疾呼要十分的　諒了。）在十年以前。社會上只有新舊兩種醫者。舊的有舊的學理。並不敢膠許知新。新的亦不敢參古。兩者分清。各做各的事。如果各有各的記錄。各有各的統計。也許有一種相當的是非出來。假使不拿全世界各國來比較。還不能說中國無醫藥。最近十年來。發生了投機式的「新舊貫通」。什麽中風就呌腦充血。也有中經中絡。」等等論　那才是人民的大刦到了。</p>
<p>新醫是根據科學來的。舊醫是根據玄學來的。科學要澈底的了解。玄學要意會而不可以言傳。現代的物理化學。和遠出易經的陰陽五行。恐怕一時聚不來頭。不曉得幾個世紀。才有貫通的一天。所以國醫館保存舊醫的學說不妨留作一種文獻。待幾個世紀之後。作一印證。要拿來實用。恐怕不合潮流。並且玄學的研究。似乎無止境。而止境又即在目前。（詳圖）狠沒有進行的程序。（但是現在辦國醫館的目的。却又不然。似乎不是請飽學的舊醫。整理固有的記載。乃是行打了玄學的根抵。加上科學帽子）。作者有二個朋友。一是王邈達先生。在杭州行舊醫業。大概舊醫先生們也狠佩服他吧。一個就是他的令弟。王味根先生。在紹興辦醫院。他是從德留學回來的新醫。他們二位。雖屬昆仲。却從未自許溝通學說。不過王味根先生的學理。還能敎化别人。至於邈達先生的技能、則據他說。只可意會。不可言傳。這是玄學太難太少。不切實用的比喻。也就是飽學之士。不肯牽强附會的一例。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c200">提倡病理解剖智識之普及 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>人類之臟腑。無病時之狀態。與罹病時之狀態不同。無病之人之内部全景。已有人體模型及解剖圖譜等可考。各新式書坊中都可得見。又有中學校之生理敎科書中。亦記載其大略。所以現代之人。對於無病平常之人（以下略稱平人）之内部全景。（以下略稱内景）約略可以明白。所以古人肝左脾右。心七竅。肺六葉等種種謬誤。略爲指摘。即能了解。因其對於此種常識。已經修得故也。</p>
<p>至於病人之内景如何。各書坊旣無病理圖譜。又少病理模型。普通學校中。又無敎授病理之課程。無普通病理敎科書可以參考。社會人士。欲知病人内景。無從窺見其秘藏。所以中風之病。明是髓腦發生變故。而社會之人。猶云是痰是熱。肺癆之病。明是肺中發生變故。而社會之人。猶云是虚是邪。夫病之情僞不明。則所以休養療治之者。方針不定。意志不固。甚至醫巫並進。雜藥亂投。殞身傷財。無益有害。甚可憫惜也。</p>
<p>所以我之主張。取各種重要疾病之内景變化。演成淺說。或載之日報。或編成小册。流布社會。公開病窟之秘。揭示變態之眞相。則禹鼎在目。而魑魅罔兩。無所藏其好矣。社會人士。亦可以曉然於某病之巢穴。在何臟何腑。某證候之發生。是受何種變化之影響。更進而求巢穴之布置。變態之種類。則病之易治不易治。及治療之方針。休養之方法。亦可以略有把握。即醫者治療某病。欲取何種方式。其對病家之說明。求病家之諒解。亦較易爲事矣。如此。則病家非至山窮水盡。絕無辦法之時。或不至惑於邪說。蠱於外道。而醫巫並進。雜藥亂投之害。或亦可少减。病人之生命財產。喪失於幼稚家庭之主張者。或亦可以少减矣。</p>
<p>今以我國古人傳統智識之中風證候。覈以病理解剖智識。即可以訂正其謬誤。彼中風者之屍體。解剖其腦。必有出血之病窟。可以觀察。此騐之數千百人。綜之東西各國。而無或爽者也。且其出</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>血之病窟。的在不調。而所發之外證亦異。目　者。病窟在大腦後葉。古人以爲中於肝也。舌不能言者。（運動性失語症）窟在大腦　頭葉。古人以爲中於心也。唇緩者。顏面神經麻痺也。其病窟或在大腦正中𢌞旋之下部。或在内囊之膝部。古人以爲中於脾也。古人又以便秘爲中脾。便秘者。直腸麻痺。其病屬於内　神經。此候在中風不常見。與唇緩非出一源。皆歸於脾中風。更非是。又古人以鼻塞爲中於肺。中風無鼻塞之候。空言以足五藏之數而已耳。聾者。聽覺障碍也。病窟在内囊後脚之後端。古人以爲中於腎也。此古人風中五臟之說。而其病理解剖之眞相則如此。於是解剖生理病情。符合一致。而古人根據。十二經之傳統智識。以輾轉附會之病候論。可得而整理矣。其如半身不遂謂之風。但臂不遂謂这痺。實則半身不遂者。其病窟在於内囊。今兩之偏癱。但一部一肢不遂者。其病窟多在大腦皮質。今謂之單癱。於是名實混淆之紛紜。可得而理解矣。是故病理之智　荀能普及。不但社會對於疾病之觀念。可以增其明瞭之度。即對於整理圖故。亦大有裨益也。進一步言之實重屍體之吾國社會。對於病理解剖之實行。或亦可以漸漸風行乎。</p>
<h3 id="c201">我輩心目中的良醫和一班心目中的良醫 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>古人說。上醫醫不病。病而醫。醫之下者也。這種上醫。我現在且不說。因爲公衆衛生不發達的今日。當於談不到不病。這裏。我且說治療方面的良醫來說說吧。我們醫的天職。表面上看來。似乎只要治病。但是治病。也當有一個大目標。不是說抄襲古方。私淑成法。便算了事。也並不是須效子產的濟人溱淆。便算了事。更不必蹈宰我的從井救人。便算了事。因爲疾病。並不限於古人所知。尤不限於古人能治。更不限於我所知。我能治。而古人和我所知所治疾病之外。隨時代。隨地方。隨環境。都可隨時的發生。隨時的蔓延。即照我們目下的觀察和實騐。大有無限增多的趨勢。這種增加的疾病。旣欲知他。又欲治他。不是一椿很困難的事嗎。所以醫的職務。不僅善於治已知的病。還要知未知的病。和治未知的病。不僅能治已知未知的病。還要改良和發明對付已知和未知的病。因此。我們决不能固執成規古法。便算滿足、便算盡職。我從前不曾經說過了嗎。古醫和今醫。根本上的觀念。絕然不同。古醫主保守的。今醫主進取的。古醫只拿成法做信條。今醫常拿成法做參考。古醫重理想空論。推解醫理。對会症候。今醫用科學物質。消滅病原。治療疾病。所以他的趨向方針。和經營工作。往往背道而馳。當然沒有一致合作的可能。今日社會間秩序的紊亂。和職業的複雜。可以說已達極點。學術的程并。和智識的階級。動輙相去二三千年。於是各人的心目。不能貫注在一條線上。乃勢所必然。我輩自認難免帶時代性的一個醫者。在這個時代。做這個時代的人。醫這個時代的病人。用的方法。也應當合乎現代。用的藥品。也應當切乎現代。因爲過去的醫藥。已經落伍。恰同我們帶時代性的醫者。當然也不免不合將來。因此今日我輩心目中。可稱做良醫的。大約不外下邊所講的幾級。第一良醫。是能夠絕滅一種。或幾種人類大敵的病原的人物。第二良醫。是能改良古法。療治已知的疾病。和發見新法。療治未知的疾病的人物。第三良醫。是能喜用成法。應付疾病的人物。至於一知半解。將人類貴重的身體。當做藥品試騐塲的魔。並不得爲醫。當然夢想不到一個良字。並且連庸字。也還難望。因爲庸。平常也。又不易之謂庸。所謂碌碌庸庸之輩。旣無益於疾病。也無損於疾病。爲保持他名譽地位。和飯碗起見。不過開幾味輕描淡寫的湯頭藥味。大家雖稱頌他一個名醫的人物。其實是名實相符的一個庸醫。他决不能殺人。也不能活人。終於誤人而已。這是我輩心目中的良醫見解了。</p>
<p>現在。我再說幾句一班心目中的良醫罷。前面我不說過嗎。目下社會中。學術的程度。和智識的階級。相去有二三千年的距離。當然心理萬難一致。稱到量呢。大約千分之一。是現代的。千分之十。是近代的。千分之二十。是懐疑的。其餘。都是上中古的腦筋了。（别的我不敢說醫學智識上量的分配大致適當。）所以有上中古腦筋的人物。必須將上中古學問智識去配置。方始合拍。我們現社會。物質方面。大都是新的。智識方面尤其量醫藥方面。大都是舊的。所以二千年前的醫藥。是最合我國現社會心理。最受現社會的衆的歡迎。而這種信仰心。並不是所收事實上的效果。是智識和心理上的一種幻象。因此社會心目中的良醫。當然不可不從這方面去推求了。一方面。現代性智識階級的人物之外。加以近代性和懐疑的兩部。也免不了受我過其實的影響·將醫藥的事實。理沒於傳聞之中。不必說無辦識力的民衆。將入其彀中。即富有判斷力的人物。往往一時也當局而迷。分不出什麽青紅皂白。也很不少。所以良醫兩字。更難說了。不過敏於趨利的醫者。得此良機。便單刀直入。他知道社會崇拜文字的風未替。便利用時機。運用他的筆墨吹聽。吸引病人。他又知道朝内無人莫做官。市内無人莫做醫的原則。除了不得罪於巨室而外。更努力的籠絡富豪。結交權貴。利用他們。間接的吸引病人。他又知道金錢魔的偉大。慈善名義的動聽。便假慈善的名。小破其澀囊。間接的吸引病人。這種手法。都是醫術之外的醫術。他的吸引力。非常的强大。沒幾個年頭。便嬴得門庭若市。頌聲不絕了。所以將病人多少做標準的良醫。是社會一班民衆智識和心理上一種幻象的良醫。並不是我輩心目中的良醫。是醫術之外醫術所得結果的良醫。並不是我輩上面所講的幾種學術上的良醫。再進一步講。社會一班。誤認爲良醫的醫。他吸引得病人愈多。他醫的責職愈輕减。愈敷衍。因爲他死命的要保持他的飯碗。對於疾病。不求有功。只求無過。所以他的方藥。只博得大家稱贊一聲平穩。他便得脫了誤人生命的關係。更進一步。他病人旣多。精力却有限。他醫治開方的工夫。要計算時間。增加收入。所以待久的病人。只要得到醫生。一觸其脈。一開其方。已經心滿意足。方的對不對。和藥的靈不靈。他們也不問了。還有一般的社會心理。不是他們心目中的良醫。開了一方。服了一藥。仍有許多的批評和指摘。輪到他們所謂良醫的身上。便有差誤。丢了家人生命。他們不但不有半聲一句的怨言。還死心搭地的替他們辯護。說是經某某良醫治過。都治不好的。眞呌做犯了死病。沒法的了。也並沒有人再去研究研究病人的病。和他們所開的方。所用的藥。！唉！你想可嘆不可嘆呢。但是現在這種良醫，仍爲過江之鯽。而且還生生不已哩。究竟是好現象呢。還是壞現象。且等大部分的民衆們。將腦筋開些快車。趕上二千年。方才可以開講。不然。只有在黑夜昏沉中。聽聒耳蟪蛄的嘈嘈罷了。</p>
<h3 id="c202">治療說 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 愚公</p>
<p>常人心理。以爲醫師治病。專恃診脈與處方。病愈則歸功於藥。不愈則歸咎於藥。一若治療工作。藥石而外。並無他道。醫師診病之時。苟不開方。即引起病人之誤會。或以爲醫歸學識之不足。或以爲病症治療之不易。種種猜測。不一而足。甚且對於整個醫界。發生懐疑。以致西醫長於外科。短於内科之觀念。深入人心。此誠新醫推行之大障碍也。</p>
<p>夫治病之道。經緯萬端。首當作確切之診斷。繼宜有合理之治療。所謂合理治療者。乃將歷來科學家所研究應用之方法。對症施治。初不僅限於藥石也。試舉數例以明之。</p>
<p>㈠休息治療　夫人生不幸患病。首宜注意者。爲保持體力。不作絲毫浪費。以期增加抵抗功能。驅逐病魔。恢復健康。理甚明顯。　之患傷寒症或肺炎者。須極端靜臥。至體温恢復常態後十日。方可起床。忠流行性感冒者。亦應靜臥至少二日，患肺癆者。苟有寒熱。應絕對在床靜養。俟熱退後。二三星期。方可起床。熱再發時。又須靜臥。此種休息治療。收效奇偉。而常人心理。以爲臥病床褥。殊非佳兆。故雖身帶寒熱。仍之勉强起坐。馴至不但原有症無從减輕。即併發症亦相繼發生。昧於先機。每陷不治。此休息治療之重要。不能不加之意也。</p>
<p>㈡飲食治療　飲食治療。在各種病症。關係綦重。如治糖尿症。每日飲食。必須銖兩悉稱。支配適當。質量規則。須視病人之逐日情形而定。其所給「炭水化物」及「蛋白質」之分兩。以使尿内不含糖質爲準，而「指肪質」之分量。務使病人不至不酸中毒之發現，患急性腎臟炎者。須令淡食。並免除「蛋白質」之含物。患脚氣者。其主要療法。爲矯下其食物中所缺之「維生素」患佝僂病者。食物中須有「維生素甲」。至於其他疾病。有應用液體食物。　　食物。滋養食物。或固體食物者。因病面異。若夫患急性胃炎者。往往除水久。不許進食。以期胃都粘膜。得相當休息。此飲食治療之不容忽視也。</p>
<p>㈢冷或熱的治療　外體冷熱之施。影響病狀。亦至重要。如患急性腎　炎者。往往用熱濕布裏體。使病人出汗。庶體内毒質。不能由尿道排洩者。可由汗排出之。患傷寒或肺炎者。置冰依於額部。患喉痧者。置於頸部。患胃潰瘍而出血者。置於腹之上部。而中暑者竟須全身浸入冰水中。再用濕巾揩擦。至體温下降一○一度爲止。冷熱應用。因病而殊。非獨减輕症狀。並有挽回性命之效能。吾人寗能忽之　　㈣手術治療　手術治療。方法不一。開刀注射。盡人皆知。然手術之不限於刀圭及注射者。有人工呼吸手術。放血手術。及　血手術等。人工呼吸。應用綦廣。如煤氣中毒。嗎啡中毒。麻醉劑中毒。及　木　中毒者。每能起死回生。放血手術。用於急性心的機能不全。能减少肺内毛血管之膨脹。輸血手術。可用於流血過多。一養化炭中毒。及漫性貧血等症。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c203">中藥西用 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>中醫雖有寒熱温凉升降浮沈之說。這都是爲着附和陰陽五行等謬說而來的。然其有治療疾病的交力。確不能湮沒。如半夏鎭吐。麻黃發汗。杏仁治咳。大黃下瀉等。都是實在成續。如何以能鎭吐發汗治咳下瀉。則皆所不知。此是知其然而不知其所以然也。現在要知其所以然。則不得不用一番科學的整理及研究工夫。如用植物學去認識他的類屬。用生藥學去鑑定他的好爾。用化學去分析他的性質。有藥物學去試騐他的功交。作或有統系的報告。　醫家去臨症施用。如此。非獨本有所功效可以證實。新的效力。亦常有發見。然這番整理及研究工夫。非有充足的經費。和素有研究的新醫藥人才。經過相當的長時間不可。並非粗製濫造不知所云的混和藥。附和一點尙在研究討論中的醫藥新學識。用演譯童話様的廣告術。即可告於衆曰。此某病之特效藥也。此經科學改良之新藥也。有如近時市塲上非醫藥家所出之藥品。自欺欺人。誠爲科學界之蟊賊。醫藥界之害馬也。現在爲製藥者有所遵循計。爲用藥者有所標準計。將中藥曾被人整理研究過。其性狀已經明悉。其效用已經證實。均由學理而成事業。且收載在中華藥典中者。節錄於此。藉可增添。一般國民之術生常識。便請醫購藥時有所選擇。惟說來或有不是處。還祈醫同志能進而敎之爲幸。（未完）</p>

<p>（一）原棉不足　我國棉花出口、向爲大宗土產之一、近年來以紗廠日增、需用原棉日多、本國棉花產額不足以供給廠家之需要、遂至美國棉花及印度棉花源源進口、民國十九年外國棉花進口總數達一百七十兆海關兩之鉅、合國幣二百六十兆元以上、民國二十年外國棉花進口總數、亦有海關銀一百三十兆兩、合國幣二百兆元以上、此爲我國棉業之一缺點、</p>
<p>（二）棉質粗劣　我國棉花不但產額太少、且多數品質不佳、不適合於紡細紗之用、近數年來、雖盡量輪入良好美種、但以我國棉農缺乏知　、不知選種留良之法、故原來纖維較長之美種、經過數年以後、亦逐漸退化、而變爲粗劣、以致紡細紗及雙股線者仍不能不講美棉爲原料、因而爲外國匯兌昂貴以至失敗者比比皆是、此爲我國棉衆之第二缺點、</p>
<p>（三）積弊太深　我國棉花市場、向無一定　準售賢棉花者、往往以次花攙和佳棉、更有加潮攙水、以期加重分量、圖得不正當之利益、攙水棉花、於夏初往往霉爛、使紗廠方面大受無形損失、此爲我國棉業之第三缺點、</p>
<p>（四）棉花偷漏　我國内地棉花運至通商大埠、遠者數千里、近亦數百里、沿途偷混損失亦鉅、鬆包無論矣、卽機器緊包俗稱洋架子者、亦有偷漏之弊、使棉花成本增高、此爲我國棉業之第四缺點、</p>
<p>（五）紡織校術幼稚　我國棉紡織工業、比較各國本爲後起、近年來技術方面、較前已有進步、然比較日商各廠、仍屬相形見絀、此爲我國棉業之第五缺點、</p>
<p>（六）工人雖於管理　我國工人因知識缺乏、原來工作能力已不如人、加以近年來潮流所趨、糾紛送起、甚至有不事工作專以鼓動風潮爲能事者、工廠方面、對管理上之困難、幾至於束手無策、此爲我國棉業之第六缺點、</p>
<p>（七）工作能力薄弱　我國紗廠僱用工人、比較日商各廠增加甚多、日商紗廠紡二十支紗、每萬錠約用工人二百四十人、我國紗廠同様紡二十支紗、每萬錠約用工人至少三百五十人多至七百五十人、因爲日廠内無工會、工人均有訓練工作、技術較高、而華廠則否、此爲我國棉業之第七缺點、</p>
<p>（八）生產數最較低　日商各廠產額、根據民國十四年調查、紡二十支紗每十小時每錠產額平均爲點四三四磅、若照每日二十四小時計算、二十支紗每錠出數在一磅以上、同時我國各廠紡二十支紗每二十四小時每錠出數平均約爲點七磅、相差至三分之一、此爲我國棉業之第八缺點</p>
<p>（九）工繳成本較大　因爲上述種種原因、華廠工繳成本、比較日廠爲大、因此日商各廠卽使售價稍低、亦能獲利、况在平時日廠各紗因品質較好、售價常在華廠各紗以上、在同等條件之下、華廠頗難與日廠競爭、此爲我國棉業之第九缺點、</p>
<p>以上就原料技術及工繳成本而言、我國棉業已難與日廠競爭、但我國棉業在金融運輸等方面、尙有其他種種缺點、</p>
<p>（一）缺乏公積　在華日廠、均係支廠歴年營業獲利、之有鉅大公積、各種合計所有公積在資本一培以上、故根深蒂固、而華商各廠、多數無公積、卽有亦爲數不鉅、</p>
<p>（二）資本薄弱　華商各廠、往往事業大於資本、金融週轉極爲困難、</p>
<p>（三）利息太昂　困爲缺少活動資本、不能不向銀行錢莊借疑、月息常在一分以上、有高至月息一分四五厘者、實有不勝負担之苦、</p>
<p>（四）運輸太慢　日商　運美國及印度棉花、與日商輪船公會訂有特約、儘先裝運、卽在中國各地運銷紗布、亦有日本商輪儘速爲之裝運、華商各廠、不但無對外航業、卽國内交通亦障　重重、在運輸上比較日商大爲遜色、</p>
<p>（五）苛捐繁重　日商購花賣紗、有條約保護、一稅之後、卽可通行全國、而華商各廠、則不能享此利益、内地各廠之苛捐雜稅、至今存在者尙多　　（六）内地紗廠爲人魚肉　在通商大埠、工廠林立、且多有洋商設立者、意外之事較多、至於内地各廠因爲交通不便、消息不　、常受意外之摧殘、而無法伸訴</p>
<p>（七）紗廠當局眼光短淺不能固結團體　日本棉紡織工業、有　固團體、用其全力、　迫我國棉業、向我國棉業進攻、欲以日本棉業襲斷中國市場、數年以來着着進　、日本棉貨輪入中國、已佔中國進口貨之第一位而日商在華各廠、比較華廠又佔優越地位、而我國各廠當局、尙不能固結團體以祭外侮、此亦我國棉衆不易發農之一大原内也、</p>
<p>棉業對於國民經濟及國家財政、旣處於極重要之地位、而其自身之百孔千瘡、又如上述、爲今之計、不能不希望政府積極救濟、最重要者有二、</p>
<p>（一）增加進口棉貨關稅　我國進口棉貨、以日貨爲最我、因有民國十九年中日關稅互患協定之束縳、不能自由加稅、惟較協定將於民國二十二年五月六日滿期距今不足五個月、深望政府早日注意及此、預爲準備、一俟該協定滿期、卽行宣布進口棉貨增稅之具體辦法、以保護本國棉業、</p>
<p>（二）積極籌畫發展棉業之整個計畫　我國棉業之缺點有種種方面必須統盤籌算成立、積極發展棉業之整個計畫、同時並遵、不能枝枝節節從事解决、政府而有積極發展棉業之决心、不患無　法、鄙人不敏、將爲我政府續陳其意見、</p>

<p>— 珂譯</p>
<p>第二章　貨幣之本位</p>
<p>古人積悠久之經騐後、始知金屬乃製幣之最佳材料、爰卽專以之　幣供用、他種貨輔遂逐漸淘汰、而舍屬貨幣乃成爲唯一之流行者、㈠金屬轉輪極易、其處理較之任何其他事物爲便利㈡彼等又極能耐久並不因時代之經過、而使其品質有所損壞、即經轉輾之使用、其消耗亦極少、㈢如祇以其作爲商品而論、則其在製造事業方面功用至大、故人皆樂得之‘㈣且彼等又多光澤明輝、可作爲裝飾品因之其價値亦隨以增高、㈤彼等之體質又至易分裂、可隨意製成任何大小之單位以供用、最後、金屬之數量較少、但又不過少、其數較之日用之物因較少而使之可得一較高之價値、但亦不過少、使其數量足以應社會上一切之需要、總此諸點、可知金屬實兼具良好貨幣之六項資格、故其能被採用爲貨幣之原料也宜矣、</p>
<p>此六項之標準在今日之園法中、固仍爲選料　幣之標凖、但在古代則其中有數省尤爲有力、第一、金銀與銅、古時出土數量較少、故其價格亦較高第二、此等軟性之金屬、即以較粗陋之工具、亦能範鑄如意、除此之外、金銀在古代人民中、尙有一種宗敎性之神聖品質、蓋此二物爲古代人民所知之最精美物質、故彼等恒以之呈獻於其所崇拜之神、而以之裝飾其廟宇及佛像、經此以後、人民漸以爲金銀乃屬於神聖者、而其價値乃亦隯以更高</p>
<p>因此諸端金銀及銅在較進步之民族中、多被用作貨幣以替代一切其他之媒介物、惟在一時其中、鐵亦曾　用爲貨幣而流行於各地然不久即　淘汰、　　之數量日益增加、其價格隨以路落、以之用爲貨幣、必須大量而後可、笨拙累發、使用爲難、故卒歸廢棄、而由其他較便利之物代之也用鐵爲幣之例、在史頗夥、如斯之達之拉寇搿司Lycurgus曾以明令規定以鐵爲法幣彼所以行此者、因彼不欲斯巴達之人民成爲一商業化之人民、而忘其武士這之精神也、鐵之爲物至爲笨重以之爲幣可减少人民努力以積聚鐵幣之企望、而商業亦可以减少其吸引人民、使從事其中之勢力而從斯巴達之人民、乃得專注意於武持之訓練、以造成强健之軍國民也、</p>
<p>銅亦遷漸喪失其銅幣之地位、時至今日、彼乃屢被用爲輔幣、以支付極小之數目而已、</p>
<p>幣質旣逐步趨向於金銀、同時各進步國家更向貨幣標準化一方進行、貿易之推廣、使其範圍、數量、及手續日益博大而繁頣、故欲求其事之進行便利、必須有因定重量及價格之貨幣而後可、最先向此方進行、而成爲定幣者、似爲裝飾品、古代之裝飾品、其目的固在飾體以增美觀、但有時亦兼用作幣圜地、例如聖經卽載有用裝飾品爲貨幣之事、創世紀述盧皮加Rehekah以不飲亞伯拉罕之僕夫並及其駝、其人卽以一重半歇格爾Shekel之耳飾及一重小歇格爾之臂飾爲酬、此卽可　明裝飾品實兼被用爲貨幣也、</p>
<p>由標準化之裝飾品進而爲固定之鑄幣祇一指顧問事、所爲錢幣者、不過一固定重量之金屬内包有固定之純粹成分、由一羣或一有力者　定其可靠而加以印鑑使成一固定之使用形式而已、此種證定之事、可由一羣之冶金匠任之、可由一羣之商人任之、亦可由一二帝王任之、最早之錢幣使用、得之於埃及與立地亞、而二者中尤以後者之使用爲先、</p>
<p>最早之錢幣、係合金銀二物而鑄成、此項合全名曰Elictune、其所以用此二者會合鑄幣者、初非由於鑄幣者故意爲之、而實係出於不得已也　銀二者之苗恒混而爲一、其時缺乏良好之冶工以分離之、爰卽因而用之、卽成此合益之幣也、</p>
<p>金銀合鑄之幣、其色澤至不雅觀、故人民之冶金知識一進步卽從而分析之、棍煉之、而以之分别鑄幣、同時並略參其他賤金等以增加其硬度及色澤、</p>
<p>錢幣流行後、貿易之事乃大便利、因錢幣之價値旣經固定、而其計敷又極容易非若金塊或其他之必須試騐、度量及隨用分剖也、</p>
<p>錢幣之使用、固非有百利血無一弊者、其間之危險亦至多、僞幣私鑄者自古已有之、卽正式鑄幣者亦恒侵鉵貨幣之重量及成分以爲私利、奸巧者或剝鑿錢幣、　取散金以爲利、或以酸素　幣而由其中提取滓屑、以自肥、或以新幣相磨、收其落屑以供用、諸如此類之問題、自有錢幣以來、卽隨之發生、而以今日爲尢甚、任何國家皆有極嚴之法律以懲私鑄者及毀幣者、任何國家每年皆費巨大之經費以保證其貨幣之成分及重量、困此而不行、則劣幣一多、所有之良幣將悉爲之驅摒於流通之外矣、但在事實上、此項情形仍往往而有之、網禁雖密、犯者仍夥、政府固亦無如之何也、</p>
<p>劣幣驅逐良幣之理由至爲简單人民恒喜夫擇十足之貨幣而窖藏之、而聽次等之劣幣流行於市、銀行家及商人亦然、彼等須將錢幣運至外國以支付各項債務、外國之承受者、對此項錢幣必經審定而後方肯承受之故爲信用及便利起見、彼等亦必收集良幣而輪之於外國、兩者會合、使市面上流行之錢幣、良者日少而劣者日多、於是一般人民鑒於劣幣之充斥而恐其不可靠、乃亦競收藏良幣、而良幣之流行額乃日益少矣、</p>
<p>首見及此現象而注意及之者爲英之葛蘭香SirThomasGresham葛氏爲英之著名銀行家及商人、彼見及此項情形、乃指陳之於衆而申說其利害、故劣幣驅逐良幣之定則卽名爲葛蘭香氏定律、Gresham,sLaw此一定律、不徒在中古時爲適合卽在今日亦仍有用、惟其間之劣幣、乃不僅爲剝鑿及成分有不足之硬幣矣、</p>
<p>以兩種金屬合製一種硬幣之事名爲Symmetcjism日此名詞在各經濟學者之論著中恒可遇之‘惟其意義無關重要、因會合鑄幣之事因早已淘汰也、</p>
<p>在文化較高之各國、金銀恒分鑄兩種錢幣而相輔互用、同爲法幣、此種情形名爲複金本位Bimeetallism、複金本位一制、自有經濟學以來、卽爲一爭辯至烈之主題同時又曾在各國引起極大之政治爭執、即在今日亦復如此、關於此制度之綸著、可稱汗牛充棟、各種之偏見及詭說皆附著於其上、惡之者斥之爲一切經濟罪惡之來源、好之者則目之爲最有伸縮而能適應　代及地方需要之制度、是是非非波詭雲騰、無怪一般之人恒以之爲不能瞭解之一事也、</p>
<p>雖然複金本位一制度固爲人所不能瞭解者乎、則稍一推察、卽可知其不然、止制度知之非難、而惟行之爲艱耳、採用複金本位之國家以金銀二者同爲法幣、人民可以任何一者支付債務及完納租稅、且二者又可相互爲用、欠金者可還之以銀、負銀者可償之以金、債　人固不能以其異類而遽拒收也、</p>
<p>複金本位之施行、由法律規定之、政府指定造幣廠國庫、或中央銀行、凡有人以黃金求售者、須以相當數目之錢幣承購之、而又須保證於任何時間之下、皆須以此代價出售此量之純金、同時彼等對於純銀亦有同様之責任、凡有以純銀求售者、皆須以若干之代價購取之、而又須保證於任何時間之下、以同額之代價出售純銀、（未完）</p>

<p>— 侍佛</p>
<p>「船上起了異外的事了，請你來一同和我查看一下吧。「你失掉了什麽東西麽？」那個穿着制服的職員問。</p>
<p>「不是；怕有人命的事情，我自信我的判斷不會錯。請你一同來看一看吧。」</p>
<p>那個職員驚訝地站起身來，疑惑地看了看那個老人，老人接着說：</p>
<p>「請你多呌幾個人，最好拿着手槍之類的東西，這事是不大容易辦的。」　　那個職員不敢自主，走去見了船長，把事重述了一遍，船長不大相信這話，細細地盤問着老人。老人並不多回答，只是說，「快一點吧，船就要到碼頭了，這事你們是要負責任的。」</p>
<p>船長沒有法，只得依着那老人，招了幾個個手隨着他，並且交一把手槍給那職員。</p>
<p>老人到了那艙房中，推門擁進去，那個中年人正在安詳地打點着行李，看見有幾個身穿職服的人隨在老人的身後，面孔立刻變得慘白了。老人指着他對着水手們說：</p>
<p>「先把這個人看好！」幾個水手左右擁上去。</p>
<p>那個中年人狡猾得很，並不反抗，只是對他們厲聲地問：「什麽事呀！」　　老年人凝視着他，說：</p>
<p>「朋友，你該講實話了，那個青年到那裏去了？我們來找你要人的！」</p>
<p>「那我怎麽曉得呢？他剛剛走上去的。」那個中年人仍狡辯着說。</p>
<p>老人好像有十分地把握，指揮着水手們搜尋着艙裏，床底，稍大的箱裏，凡是可疑的地方，都搜尋過了，但是仍不見那青年。</p>
<p>老人沉思着，查看着屋裏，但是沒有足以隱藏一個屍首那樣大的地方了。可是突然，老人在床上邊的行李架上，暼見一個打好了的舗蓋卷，他走近嗅了嗅，裏邊發出一種厭人的異香的味道，老人明的了，急忙退到門口，勝利地命令水手們打開那舗蓋，但自已急忙把頭轉向外面去。</p>
<p>那個中年人聽到老人的最後的話，渾身立刻痙攣着，雙腿曲下了。</p>
<p>我想，沒有人願看那舗蓋裏的東西吧？丨外面是一個麻布的舗蓋皮，皮裹一張被，被裏是一張整齊舗好了的油紙，　但是在油紙裹，是血肉的泥······老人想得是不錯的，那個青年果然仍是靜靜地臥在那房間裏，</p>
<p>爲什麽老人從舗蓋裏嗅到異香呢？我不相信在這世界上會有那様殘忍細心的殺人者，雖然是在我們這様殘酷的封建的社會裏。</p>

<p>— 星子</p>
<p>並不是偶然，我走過新世界。震天價的鑼鼓在裏面響着，門外還紥有花花緑緑的松柏牌樓。我想，今天並不是聖誔節，但，立刻，念頭廻轉，知道這是與報紙上大幅廣告中的「請大家同來一哭」有關。摸摸心頭，雖說似乎有點酸意，但，哭，郤一時來不及這一副急淚，心一橫，便從「同來一哭」的「善男信女」的人叢裏溜過了。</p>
<p>然而，這一溜，心頭的酸意，却反而越來越沉重。溜到了先施公司，回頭一望，索興有點後悔起來！我駡自己是傻瓜，但天在上，我的確不曾駡我自己是「冷血動物。」</p>
<p>我想，這該是多麽熱鬧！就在這鑼鼓喧聲裏，有「花，」有「星，」有歌，有舞，有「愛國」的淚，有「慈悲」的淚，有「含淚」的笑，·········</p>
<p>我想，這該是多麽有意思！救了國，救了人，又修了福，積了善，而自己也確實開了「憂國的心！」舉一得五，·········</p>
<p>我還想：這該是多麽風流綺膩！於救國之後，救人之餘，「我的「花，」你來，」送上一頂美麗的花冠！「我的「星，」你來」跳一回却司登舞，肉香，粉也香，·········</p>
<p>想了許多，輪指一算：旣熱鬧，又有意思，又風流綺膩，心頭上立刻像馬蟻在爬，癢癢地，</p>
<p>直到這時，我還在後悔，我痛恨我的眼淚下爭氣，我痛駡我自己是傻子。但，天在上，我的確沒有駡我自己是「冷血動物！」</p>
<h3 id="c223">寫給未婚的姊妹們 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 紫玖女士</p>
<p>親愛的姊妹們：</p>
<p>你們正在甜夢中優游着吧？理想的未來，正在你們的腦海中翻轉吧？但，流光一秒秒地向後死去，現實生活，將一幕幕在你生命史上披露。當你發覺現實與理想相去迢遙時，你將驚惶，惱怒，傷感，悲痛：</p>
<p>我們可以永久不斷地有理想的幻夢，同時我們不得不歡迎現實生活的來臨。現實，是平凡的；人，誰也不能離開這平凡生活。結婚，這是從理想的幻夢中，踏進現實生活中第一段。在你們尙未踏上這階段前，你們不得不有所準備。　　第一，我得問你已經有了愛人沒有？如果已經有了，那末你們將更進一步實行結婚：但是你得審愼，你的對手的趣味習慣，是否和你相同？這是最要緊的，丨丨我所說的趣味習慣‘泛指日常生活，學業研究丨丨不然一時惑於盲目的熱情而結合，在共同生活開始後，漸漸的南轅北轍，你要西，他要東，在這仍尊敬看處女膜的中國裏，非在萬不得已時，還是不離婚爲妙，因此不得不愼之在先。</p>
<p>第二，你們倆的年齡問、題，女子比較容易衰老，男子的性生活，可以棉廷到六七十歲，而女子早則四十，遲則五十三四已經完了。所以你的對手方，須年齡比你大才行，少婦嫁老夫，當然不宜，老姊姊嫁小弟弟，更不相當，最好你比你的他小七八歲，同居生活，固然不全賴性來維持，但是至少牠佔全生活的一把交椅。此外，你若是很壯健，千萬不可與病夫結合；你要是瘦弱病身，最好不與肥健者結婚。</p>
<p>第三，你熱戀中，千萬不可失了理智的判斷：A，學業未成，萬不能結婚。B，戀愛貴在轉輾漸進，彼此多接觸，互相認旘，互相了解，由多年的朋友而成夫婦，比較突進速入，一見傾心的結合好些。C，你須熟商於你的好友或家長，徴求他們的意見，當局者迷，旁觀者清，他們定能給你很好的貢獻。</p>
<p>第四，在你尙未結婚前，你須問問自己，有沒不性生活的常識？結婚，就是性生活的開始，這不是一椿羞恥或神秘的事，你得早早研究，至少要看一本性的衛生或性生活的書本，有不少處女，因缺乏這常識，终身得不到美滿的快感，疾病隨之，這不是很痛苦嗎？</p>
<p>第五，抱着戀愛至上主義，爲了戀愛犧牲你的一切的一切，终至你沒有自我，沒不事業，沒有你的立場，做了他人的人，這自然不可；但是倘若你一味以玩弄異性爲能事，供你官能的享樂與滿足。玩弄人，常等於玩弄自己，尤其尙在男性中心的社會裏，你應該將你有閒的時間，與玩弄人的聰明才智，移至學業的研究，熱心於事業的發展，這才是眞正的新女性。以上幾條，係偶感所得，未知諸姊妹以爲如何？他日有得，再當與諸位討輪。</p>

<p>— 維翰</p>
<p>土人關於神的觀念，也是很有趣的。一般地講來，神乃永刦不滅的極其尊高的東西，平常的住所是天空，他有非常巨大的人的恣態，皮膚是紅的，頭髮是長的，一直披到肩頭，脚的様子便和愛繆鳥的一般。（愛繆鳥乃是澳洲特產的狀似駝鳥的巨鳥。）而有的神，即有狗一様的脚，並且有很多妻子。神的性質是很善良的，他們只支配着天國，至於地上的事情，却是不干涉的。他們並不創造人，也不管人的閑事。不過傳說上却說他們很高與把好人的靈魂接去天堂，而土人們也深信不疑。這種對於神的觀念，本來是因種族而有不同的，這裏不過講了他的一般概念而已。</p>

<p>二紅百合</p>
<p>有一個時期，我曾經很顛倒於法郎士的著作。我愛他那華麗的修辭，冷僻的見解，和每部裏都流露着的那一種盎然淳然的書卷氣。</p>
<p>就在那様的時期，一個冬晴的上午、捧了他的奢華的「紅百合」，我和緑並肩坐在公園的椅上。蔚藍的天，浴着和暖的陽光，我不覺背叛了我的法郎士。雖是捧在手裏，我却將他精心的傑搆當作了白紙上面的黒的裝飾，沒有看見一個字。</p>
<p>望着默然不語的緑，豐潤的臉，緊小的朱唇，躱在耳旁的三兩圈鬈髮，我不覺動了費意。我說。請不要動，我給你寫一幅像。</p>
<p>攤在手上的「紅百合」，恰巧有着一頁整齊的空白，抽出了筆，抱着媲美造物的雄心，我輕靈的寫下了她的面影。</p>
<p>畫好了，我更討了她篋中的一點胭指，用手指染着，淺淺的敷上畫中人的雙類。</p>
<p>我還給她，她嫣然一笑。看了一刻。她向我說：</p>
<p>「送給我罷。畫得太好了，放在你那裏，要使我嫉妬，我不放心，送給我罷。」</p>
<p>聰明的心，久已知道世間最可珍貴的是什麽，我於是毫不憐惜的就拆下了這紅百合的一辦。我誠知道這是煑鶴焚琴，祇是，爲雅士而烹，爲知己而碎，法郎士也是解人，我知道他一定能諒解我的舉動。</p>
<p>隨着落花，一個春天，風兒也一同將她從我的面前帶走。五年以來，人世的浮廛已經黯淡了她在我心上所刻下的印象，一册奢華的「紅百合」也早失去了她昔日的光輝，悄立在書架上的一角。對着架上的這一册書，望着牠黯淡的姿容，我心裏不覺深深的起了懊悔。我是，結束鉛華，久已從羅網中解脫了，祇是牠似乎還帶着憔悴的相思，追戀着那被撕去了的，流落在人間的一葉。</p>

<h3 id="c226">科學新兵器 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 逸</p>
<p>的確，現在也有一部分人在厭惡戰　　的事，咒駡戰事；但，在另一方面，火力兵器中除了垣克車，裝甲汽車，戰鬥機，爆擊機，偵察機，航空船等站在第一線的兵器之外，像毒瓦斯，也正在加速進步的途中，準備發揮其最大威力。而大戰末期即已萌芽的無線操縱（機械，電氣砲，殺人光線等，假如戰事再延長二三年，則這一類的兵器便必然的都會要搬出戰塲。不過，自巴黎和會而後，這些兵器的作用如何？實騐成續怎様？各國已都不大提起，好像沒有這様一回事似的。所以不提及的原因，便是大家對於新兵器的研究，都特别秘密，各人都把電氣兵器看作瓌寳，不肯輕易洩漏。</p>
<p>這裏，我們可以决斷的說：電氣兵器！在未來戰爭中是最活動的器械。</p>
<p>第一，我們先說無線操縱罷。！利用電波和其他的幅射線，在戰地徬方隨意操縱垣克車，船艦，飛行機，不損傷自己的兵士，却可以擊破敵軍，這便呌做無線操縱。未來的戰塲上主要的武器如爆炸飛機，可以載着大量的炸彈，光臨敵陣上空，甚至遠襲敵國的首都和大城市；又如滿載着火藥的輪船可像幽靈似的，駛進敵人的商港軍港之中，突然爆發起來，因而封鎖住海口。沒有主掌的戰艦在大海洋上互以激烈的砲火攻擊，這些船隻的操縱者却遠在幾千海里以外的安全地帶，一方面喝着紅茶，啣着雪茄，一方面在操縱着無線電波。</p>
<p>現在所謂戰爭，最後的决戰總免不了一次白刃衝鋒。這様的事在未來戰爭中恐怕要成爲歴史的古跡了。也許有人以爲這種科學進步，究不知要何年何月綫會重現。然而事實告訴我們，無線操縱已經有過絕好的成續：記得一九一七年大戰末期，德國曾以滿載的水雷，在飛行機上以無線電操縱牠，去攻擊敵方海軍根據地。還有一個例是前年美國海軍爲着實騐投下爆彈，戰艦「愛合瓦」曾使用無線操縱。最近把二萬二千噸戰艦「猶大」當標的艦時，又曾實騐無綫操縱，該戰艦中一個管理的人也沒有，却能在海洋上任意疾馳。現時固然只不過是一種實彈演習，避免危險的試騐；但將來在陸地，在海洋，在空中，無綫操縱將要占很重要的地位·那是無疑的事。</p>

<p>「林海泉還沒有來麽？」聽見敎室裏的卓淑華的聲音。</p>
<p>「快上課去吧。」</p>
<p>張應奎的不高興的音詞。</p>
<p>海泉剛要進敎室，便看見卓淑華紅着兩頰微笑着從裏面走出來。他倆差不多要互碰一個滿懐了。</p>
<p>「啊呀！你此刻才來。我們剛才正談論及你。」</p>
<p>她笑着說。</p>
<p>「密絲卓，早！」</p>
<p>海泉也回報了她一個微笑。</p>
<p>因爲要上課了，她便怱怱的上樓。海泉不禁要頓着足看她上扶梯時的活潑的後影。恰好她上了三四段，也停了步翻回頭來向下面看。他倆的視線又衝突起來了。</p>
<p>「下半天下了課，到我家裏坐坐好麽？」</p>
<p>她的聲音很低小。</p>
<p>「你不是和張應奎一同住麽？」</p>
<p>「瞎鬧！」</p>
<p>她睜着她的巨眼，看了他一下，隨後從衣袋取了一支鉛筆出來，向抄本上怱怱地寫了一行多的字，便把那頁撕了下來，揑成一團，朝海泉的臉上丢來。那個紙團掉在水門江的地面上了，他忙俯着身把它拾起來。這時候，她早跑上樓上去了，他想打開那個紙團來看，但來不及了。因爲王敎授從那頭走到敎室門首來了。他紅着臉，忙跟着王先生走進敎室裏來。</p>
<p>㈩</p>
<p>他剛在自已的棹位前坐下來，正想看看卓淑華在紙團裏寫的是什麽東西，不提防坐在後面的同學在他的肩背不拍了一掌，海泉嚇了一大跳，忙把那個紙團㩙回衣袋裏，翻轉頭來一看，坐在他後面的朱君遞了封信過來給他。</p>
<p>「唐耀星托我交給你的，他今天請了假。」</p>
<p>「他老是請假的。」</p>
<p>「對啦，那位先生活動得很，不知道他幹些什麽事體。」</p>
<p>他眞無暇聽王敎授的講義了。他只覺得自己在此刻是一個要人了，心的不得開交。他先把唐耀星的信啓了封。</p>
<p>「昨天所談之事，我已約好了前方，望於五號下午七時，至我處同往，耀啓」。</p>
<p>他看了後，覺得不妥當，因爲唐耀星所定的時日和任碽士夫妻請吃飯的時日相衝突了。</p>

<p>— 吾</p>
<p>自宣佈中俄復交以後，我的朋友便説：「中國得救了」。也許這「得救」的程度。不見得準可將中國從十八層地獄中　爲世界第一等一等强國，不過中俄復交究屬喜事。譬如兩個平素要好的朋友，偶因一點小事而居然翻臉，現在又重新和好起來，當然兩造心中都有説不出的快樂。而且咱們同胞因復交而歌鼓舞王：也是事實：現有報紙爲證。　　天津商界對俄復交，均極贊成。刻集議俟俄領抵津後，即採辨俄貨代</p>
<p>仇貨。</p>
<p>不成問題，中俄復交。我們商界朋友天然很佔便宜。原來我們這貧弱的國家，免不了要外國商品接濟，旣然如此，貨品的來源，如若便宜，做生意的當然可多撈幾個。那末俄貨價廉，自是意中事，因爲照俄國的通商政策來，她的貨品輸出，並不以赚錢爲目的，而是不無相通：將本國消費不了的產品輸出外國，換進幾，再去購買本國没有或缺乏的重要工業品，所以賣中國來的，自然可以比資本主義國家的貨品便宜多了。如此説來，我們商界當然。可以笑逐顏開，銀洋元寳馬卡馬卡的滚進來。</p>
<p>至於説以俄貨來代替仇貨，天然也是可能的事。并且於名義上更是好聽，販賣仇貨，雖然賺錢，然而總带一些危險性，還要加上一個「奸商」的頭銜你想俄國標布不足和仇貨的印花洋布並駕齊驅嗎？所以旣是賺錢，又是「愛國」而且由於這一動人的號召，更可使顧主满堂，一舉數得，何樂而不爲？</p>
<p>所以，這次復交，誰都歡喜，天津的商界同志更歡喜。好罷，皇恩浩蕩，普天同慶。而且大家都説：「我們從此得救了。」</p>

<p>— 愼永</p>
<p>現在科學界裏，對於光綫有種種不同的名稱，如紅外光綫（ＩnFradRedLight）,紫外光綫（UItrovioletLight)</p>
<p>等等，旣然都是一一種光，何必定出這許多名目來呢，當然，其中有不同的地方，其實呢，不過是他們發光的波長（Wavelength)不些不同罷了，</p>
<p>現在我們所要講的X光綫，據研究科學的人，從多方面證明出來，是和光一様的，也祇是光波上的不同，X光綫的光波特别短，祇有日光（SudRays)的萬分之一，這的確是一種奥妙神秘的光綫，人們藉着牠的能力，做到了從前不能做的事，多明白了世界上以前末發明的原理，因此X光綫實在是文明進歩科學昌明的新產品，也是帮助世界文化進步的一種能力，且把　的功用分條介紹一下：</p>
<p>（一）對於醫學上的功用丨最普通的，就是可以看出跌斷的骨頭，或是陷人身體的槍彈，還有肺癆等内症亦可治療，就是最危險的内癰（Csucer)在初期犯着的時候，用　發的R光綫或這X光綫，都可治療，至少也可以減輕些，這都在犯着了病，用牠治療的，除此而外，我們可以靠此力量，預防疾病，就是没有顯著特别毛病的人用X光照片，檢騐身體，要是有什麽缺點時，就可以先設法預防或滋補，從上面看來，X光線對於醫學上的貢獻是多麽大啊，</p>
<p>（二）對於工業上的功用丨現在機器對於人生的功用太大了，不過越是力量大的機器，偶一不愼，肇禍的結果，同牠的力量成爲正比例，所以如火油的蒸燒鍋，飛機的旋輪，這些金類鎔鑄品上的毛病，如有無氣孔，破裂或有沙子夾雜等，必要靠X光綫觀察的結果，才不致有弊，還有檢查鎔接（Weld)的好歹，木料的蟲眼節䈲，量金屬器的内徑及考察汽油管的阻塞等，也要藉X光線的能力才能看出來，更有一種石棉往往外形相似而實用性質不同，而惟有X光線才能分析，餘如膠質，炸藥，石臘，牛皮，煤炭，水門汀都可用X光線，定其優劣。</p>

<p>（三）對於物理學上的貢獻丨靠丨X光線的力量，我們可以研究物質内部的構造，明瞭原子和分子的原理，顯微鏡（）Microscope雖能把物質放大到幾千倍，然而構造物質最小的單位，终沒法看出，惟有X光綫能給我們最後的解决。　　以上X光綫的功用，約略講過，現在再把牠的裝置，简單說明··</p>
<p>普通製法，先拿玻璃管，吹成一玻璃球形，玻璃球的直俓，約有六英寸，牠的兩端，各接一個直徑約一时的玻璃管，管中要裝一鵭（Jngsten）電極，一頭像銅錢形的是陰電極；陽電極的一端成板狀，平面斜成四十五度，裝好後，就把管裏面的空氣抽完，並且把管口密封起來即成，在用的時候，要在兩電極，接上電的感應圈（TnduetionCoie）電子由陰極射出就呌陰極線(Cathocle</p>
<p>Rays)射出的速度，非常迅速，遇到了鵭，就發出這奥妙的X光綫，爲我們的肉眼所不能看見，但能透穿各物質而影響可以照出像片。</p>
<p>最近發明了一種X光綫管呌柯利管(Coulidgetube)爲美國柯利博士(SrCorlidge)所發明，方法就是拿鵭的縲旋做陰電極，另拿蓄電池的電流通過，如電燈一般，若是電池的電壓很高，就能發出很强的X光綫了。</p>

<p>丨兩種不同的觀念丨</p>
<p>飯後一刻鐘的辦么室，是暢談的處所。照例的每人啣着一枝香烟·發那無裨民生的議論，藉以博得一個哈哈。話是從國家大事，下至里巷小節，無所不談。</p>
<p>今天飯後，大家照例的坐下，在準備開始舌戰而還未找得題目的時候，聽差忽來倒字簏，於是話便從這裏開始。　　小張說··「我眞不懦，一般人爲什麽要唱「敬惜字紙」？一張報紙，或是一頁舊書，到了被人遣棄的時候，它的效用，原早已失掉。難道像這種廢紙，還値得尊敬嗎？」</p>
<p>「不然」丨向來不參加討論我們呌他「前輩先生」的陳先生也發起議論來了，頓時大家精神一振。他說「字乃先聖所造，而爲傳佈文化的利器，厥功甚偉。故不問有用無用，皆當尊敬。倘走在路上，見有字紙，應當拾歸焚化，不可踐踏。」老先生很愼重地說。</p>
<p>「這是一種傳統的觀念，是過去「士的階級抬高自己身份的一種策略。試問。倘說字的應該尊敬，是爲先聖所創造，是爲傳佈文化的利器，那末那個民族沒有自己的文字，那一種文字，不傳佈文化。而你老先生方才爲什麽拿英文報紙抺桌，而對於有一個中國字的廢紙，却恭而敬之的一定要請他坐到字紙簏内去呢，這豈不是矛盾嗎？所以一敬惜字紙」，只是一種傳統的觀念，是一種習慣，而爲現在所不必尊敬的！」小李像律師樣層層地反駁着說。</p>
<p>「我以爲字紙固不必尊敬，而廢紙却値得愛惜，燒却太可惜。因爲造紙廠收去還可重製哩！」老楊不失其實用主義的本色，另伸意見說。</p>
<p>「還是焚化的妥當，」前輩先生單答復老楊說。造紙廠收去銷毀字跡，糟塌，多罪過，而且字紙灰也有用，在航行遇風時可以傾在水中鎭壓風勢哩！」</p>
<p>老楊說丨「這是「神話」，而我們所要說的是「人話」。廢物加以利用，才不是罪過的事呢！」</p>
<p>「你們都是青年，只講利用，······」</p>
<p>前輩先生默然地說。懐着滿懐的失望，坐到他的位置裏去工作去了。</p>
<h3 id="c232">今年所發現的奇事 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 白洪</p>
<p>「奇事年年有，今年持别多！」有一位朋友見了我就這様說。我慌忙問他什麽奇事。他說··請坐，請坐！聽我慢慢道來··</p>
<p>第一件奇事是宜興顯恩寺（？）裏出了鬼。而且是少女怨鬼，日夜涕泣，英雄將士，與鬼交談。這是一件悽慘的無頭風流案，說不定是孤廟裏的和尙姦殺了孤零少女。奇怪的是鬼能向雄武的將士訴寃，而且能哭，能了解人意，居然又能得到血衣，殘骨，有事爲證，自然說不得是什麽迷信不迷信了。這件案子，已經送到南京去審騐過，現在又送到上海來考騐了。</p>
<p>第二件奇事是某某地方　（恕我記不清地名了）出了妖精，那形狀像羊，某村的某某少女，被牠蠱惑，每當妖精來時某某少女即登牀作猥褻之語。日久，萎黃不堪，已被妖精蹂躪得不成人形了。後來，這位少女送到戚家去藏了起來。於是就有某姓兩姊妹遭了同樣的蹂躪。道件怪事，載之報章，言之鑿鑿，而且有名有姓，眞有其事。你能說牠是什麽齊東野語之類的無稽之談麽？</p>
<p>第三件奇事是梁作友捐欵三千萬救國，結果不名一文，被人閧走了。以一賣燒餅油條的小夥計，居然能上游京師，與國府要人大談其國家大事，而且能作一鳴驚人之語。眞是奇人奇事。</p>
<p>第四件奇事是中國山東省臨沂縣出了天皇地皇人皇。天皇李樂川，娘娘宋王氏，地皇是一個裁縫呌做傅寳祺。他們準備明年三月登基，大做其皇帝夢，自命爲眞龍天子，挑選嬪妃宮人。聞天皇已封該縣的柳氏五姑娘和六姑娘做東西兩宮的娘娘。可惜，皇帝沒有做成功，如今天皇，地皇，娘娘都坐了牢獄。便宜了人皇在逃。這眞是件奇事。中華民國二十一年竟連出了三個眞龍天子！</p>
<p>現在，民國二十一年快要完了，這一年内，總算出了不少奇事。孔聖人說過；「國家將亡，必有妖孽！」的話，如今東北淪亡，平津危急，倘若不幸而言中，那可糟糕，咱們就變成準亡國奴了！」</p>
<p>我那位朋友滔滔如流的講來，使我目瞪口呆，眼前只見得一陣昏黑！</p>

<h3 id="c233">再行讀書機會的經過編者先生·· <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>今日讀了朱君的「如何再得讀書的機會」一文，頓時使我發生了無限的感想，這眞所謂同病相憐啊丨現在我個人正是努力的和環眞相奮鬭、雖然結果如何，尙不敢知，而我艱苦的讀書經過，却不妨寫出來給大家參考一下。</p>
<p>我的讀書，開頭就受了不少的波折。在幼小時荒於嬉戲，到了小畢業，才感覺讀書是很有趣味的一回事體，後來不知怎樣，反而改進私塾，念了一食而不知其味」的論語不半年之久；又轉入一家毫無敎授法的英文書館，日夜專修。在這過程中，生活乏味，無聊已達極點了。過了二年，立志轉入高等小學，到十六歲那年，才能畢業，這中問的苦頭，完全由於家長指導的不得法，因無一定的方針，以至走入歧途。</p>
<p>爲着家庭環境的關係，不得已而改入商界，使我狂熱的讀書慾望，完全打斷。但我能得着在浦東某公司棧房充當學徒，以機會而論，總算不差；在業務之外，也頗有餘睱。當然啦！使我朝夕耿耿未嘗或忘的求知慾望，又像海水一般的湧臘上來。</p>
<p>我以爲「再得讀書的機會」到了丨乃進城内某商業英文專修夜校。自知奮勉求學，所以進步很快。到了修業期滿，又投入中英專修的某夜校，前一年，已在該校畢業。於是參考各種書籍，從事自修；但碰到的疑問極多，非常的難以解决，雖翻了字典也不能懂了。從前的先生，终是不便領敎。直待至本年秋季，才得入某院。現在呢？對於功課頗感不能跟班之苦，尤其是外國敎授，他們所講的，简直使我不能理解。但是，我仍然虚心立志的，除却應做的事務而外，一切都不管，或晨或昏，孜孜不懈的努力着，我相信總可以尋着光明的。</p>
<h3 id="c234">楊宗俠上滿足求知慾三項辦法編者先生·· <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>一個半途失學而走入商界的青年，的確是感到非常痛苦的，要解决這種痛苦和滿足他求知的慾望，當然是一件極重要的事，現在就照吾的意思發表在不面以，供失學同志的參考。</p>
<p>㈠一個學徒，練習生，或是店員，如其在夜間是有公閒的時間的，那可以加入夜校去求學。</p>
<p>㈡如這　商店的規則是··「無論店員，學徒在夜間是不能出去的」；或所有空閒的時間是不能一定，那可以加入函授學校，比較妥當。</p>
<p>㈢假使有了空閒而經濟發生問題，那只有在日常的時侯多看一些有益的報紙和書籍，或者，多和以前的同學們通通訊。因爲他們中能夠升學的，知道的地方當然比你多，而你也可以將不明瞭的地方前去請問他們了。</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>憑我往日怎様的善於鎭靜、這時候却也忍不住隨口喊了一聲「呀」！</p>
<p>「哈哈！這眞是很凑巧的。密司脫朱、我們差不多已經有三年多不見了！」她還是像從前一般的會笑，會說話。</p>
<p>還紀得她在口大的時候，高坐着皇后的寳座’誰見她，都免不抻要讚一聲：「好美麗啊！」就是我，對於她雖然並不拜倒，但是　也不能否認她的美。現在又見到了她。再把你一比，可就找不出她是美在何處了，至少限度，你是位仙女：她呢，至多也不過是一個妖精丨</p>
<p>「啊！密司李！不，也許你現在已經是馬丹什麽了，不過，我們是老同學」，生性滑稽的人，無論在什麽時候，丨就是躺到了醫院裏的解剖桌上，也是免不掉要說幾句笑話的。「不管你是馬丹什麽，我還得依舊稱你做密司。皇后大人！這話可對嗎」</p>
<p>她吃吃地笑着，足足延長了四五分鐘。</p>
<p>大經以前的爲她顚倒得如醉如痴，也是這笑的魔力。那時候，他們兩位同様是法律系的高材生。我呢，讀的是經濟；不過因爲她是全校的皇后，一個善於人交的皇后，所以我和她見面的時候也是佷多。而每次見到她，却也總連帶的見到大經；他像一個忠臣孝子似的，極恭敬地，隨侍在高跟皮鞋的後面。</p>
<p>李芳畢業時候所繳的那一篇學士論文，也是出自大經的手筆。小明友丨你想在一個熱得混身流着汗的初夏裏，大經一個人同時寫着兩篇論文，别說腦汁絞掉了不知多少，就是淌的臭汗，好不見得會在一二十磅之下了！本來，情之所鍾，别說流汗，就是流血，也甘心；所苦的是：李女士並不曾由此而金石爲開啊！</p>
<p>大經的不顧了一切的醉心於李芳的事實，在那時的確轟動過全校。大經原是一個整天蜷伏在圖書館裏的書獃子，從沒有人在運動塲上碰見過他，一半也是因爲體格太弱的緣故；可是有一次李芳竟有本事把他慫恿到級際的足球賽裏，使他戴着一副五六百度深的近光眼鏡，露着一條祇見骨絡，不見血肉的身子，雜在許多燕趙健兒，南國勇士之中，拚着老命的猛幹。結果當然是笑話百也，肢體傷殘；而李芳却倚在另一位男士的懐拘裏，狂笑了六十分鐘。一個女人這様的玩弄着一個男子，眞不能不令鬚眉削色了！而大經却甘之如飴，顚倒認爲是無上的榮幸。</p>
<p>李芳的老子，以前據說還當過什麽軍的軍長，旣然當過軍長，自然會撈錢；旣會撈錢，家裏自然很富裕；家裏旣富裕，李芳的用度自然是行闊綽了。不過，這一位姑太太的手面實在太闊綽了，雖然家裏給她的錢並不少，可是她却儘覺得不夠化；於是大經便儼然做了她的晚爺，少不得鞠躬盡瘁的儘把自己的錢供給她化。</p>
<p>可是大經本不是一個富家子弟。美麗的少猪玀，你現在大概也早知道了！他在口大念書的錢，還是他母視變賣了家裏的田地，才得支持的。所以，無論他自己怎様的刻苦勤儉，不敢妄費一錢，但是光結交這一位皇后娘娘，已經應付不來了。有一年冬天，他身上祇穿着一件很薄的駱駝絨袍子，兩條腿足足在敎室裏彈了一個多月的琵琶；後來我暗地裏盤問他，才知道他的兩件皮袍子，巳打當店裏轉了個身，列入皇后娘娘額外收入的賬目下去了</p>

<p>現在興建中之四行儲蓄會二十二層大厦，爲海上最高之建築，本刋以此種偉大工程，必有足供建築界研究者在，爰由記者與四行建築科建築師孫立已君，趨訪新屋設計者鄔克建築師，承以大概情形見告，爰亟錄之如次··</p>
<p>鄔達克建築師之肖像</p>
<p>本屋爲美洲以外之最高建築物</p>
<p>夫同一大小之地位自有一定大小之建築，就四行新屋言之，其體積爲一百六十萬立方尺，若在該地基整個面積上，即連現在雲飛汽車公司所占面積在内，一併建造新屋，則其平均高度，當爲八十四尺，茲以沿馬路一面，其地位，交通，空氣，光線，以及觀瞻等，任何方面，無不較爲優越，爰决計不將雲飛所占面積包括入内，於是新屋高度，乃可增至二百六十四尺焉，至所打椿子，長達一百十五尺，係七十五尺與四十五尺洋松接打中用鋼箍相連，此外且復挖空二十尺，即深度共達一百三十五尺，此挖空二十尺内，作五尺深鐵筯水泥基礎，藉使其基礎益臻鞏固，至於二十尺内挖出之泥，計重一千一百萬磅，換言之此一千一百萬磅即浮力而計算移動載重力（LjneLoad）爲一千八百萬磅故兩相比較約可對銷故椿子所負載者僅固定重力耳（DeadLoad）僅椿子一項其價値蓋與普通三層樓建築，不相上下。</p>
<p>新屋重量爲三千三百萬磅，全部架搆，概用合金質之鐄銅鋼，由西門子華行所供給，此種鋼料，爲萬尼林鋼廠出品，堅靱卓絕，彌極精優，至於由風力所生之壓力約三倍於新屋本身之壓力，故本屋之風力計算爲特點之一，新屋全部墻壁絕少，即或有之，亦係採用異常堅固而輕巧之磚料，精工砌製，新屋建築，採用立體式，所以增益其高度也，又關於新屋設計事宜，聯合鋼廠Lindsgog君，及Zoepke君，並皆給予不少助力云。</p>

<p>— 孫立已</p>
<p>世界工商業之興衰，每以建築物數量爲寒暑表，建築物之消長，與業務之進退，適成正比例。美國於大戰後，其工商業之勃興，完全表現於建築數量之突增，其工業技術之猛進，迄一九二八年爲全盛，一九三○年後，百業停滯，而建築亦立呈暮氣矣。</p>
<p>四行儲蓄會，自民國十二年開創以來，在十年中，其儲金總額，由一百四陶君桂林南通人自創立馥記營造廠以來據其經騐與實力經營建築成效卓著年來益致力於此各外埠之重大工程由君承造者極多成續蜚然聲譽鵲起名望日隆誠建築界之傑出人才也</p>
<p>金君福林吳縣人爲建築不可多得之人才對於工塲組織工廠管理極有經騐學識尤爲豐富自主持四行儲蓄會二十二層厦工程以來管理組織井井有條觀於該大厦工程進行之奇速由此益信</p>
<p>十二萬，增加至五千四百餘萬，約增進四十倍。其建築亦由三層樓舊屋，而自建七層大樓，并遍設分會，自建貨棧，至於最近計畫，則將於一九三三年，以二十二層大樓，供獻於我日新月異之上海市，爲公衆服務，爲東亞建一永久標識，尤足表本會與十萬儲户通力合作之成續。</p>
<p>新屋位於靜安寺路派克路白克路之間，距市中心區及外灘僅一箭之程，與英法兩租界之住宅區，交通尤稱便利，前臨廣漠之跑馬廳，附近有娱樂塲，影戲院，爲將來滬上夜生活之集中點。據全市交通之樞紐，爲南北東西各區往來必經之要道，以此屋爲銀行爲旅館必然當選。</p>

<p>上海市建築恊會袁向華譯述</p>
<p>近代科學積演進之結果，使置身建築事業者，非如往昔之能專憑實地經騐處理業務，此暨在今日之地位，實應具有萬能之才幹，以應付與日俱進之建築事業。身爲建築家者，必須明瞭形成良好建築之過程或步驟，自不待言，而於結構之設計，尤宜加以切實之注意。蓋結構計劃爲形成良好建築之中心問題，若忽略及此，則鮮有不敗事者，他如施工之管理，材料之採購，雜務之處置。在在需要精棘之幹才以應付之。然能備具上述條件之建築家，　十不得一，而在今日實有大量的需求者也。</p>
<p>一青年欲得實際之建築知　，尙能從工場中留意體貼，努力自習，輕過相當期間，對於某種工作或能應付裕如，不感困難。惟於建築之設計，工程之管理，初非加意自習所能收效，心須有人指遵，始能窺其涯略。然身爲建築師者，感應主工程師等，主持本人事務，有時尙感應接不暇，對於青年學徒之指遵，自難顧及。此爲實在之困難，固無深責之可能也僞即使對於建築之設計及工程之管理，予以相當提示，然學徒對於所得之知識，不僅拘囿於本行或本廠範圍之内，鮮有濬發新思，觸類旁通之機會。故綜觀上述，一青年欲得實地之建築知識，尙易爲力，至於建築之理讑問題，則非能從工場中求得之。但徒憑經騐，不重理讑，將蹈一「知其然而不知其所以然」之弊病。故一建築家之成功，抑亦困難矣。</p>
<p>美國建築事業之發逹，在今日登峯造極，逹於最高度。人民對於住的幸福，已極盡享用：此固由於國民經濟能力之充裕，始克臻此，然一般民衆對於建築學術之趣味化普遍化，亦爲造成國内建築事業特步發逹之主因。政府當局旣積極培植建築人才，以備他日之需要，私人方面或建築公司更紛助經費，在各大學設置獎金或講座，鼓勵青年學子從事於建築之途一最著者如勞易傑（LouisJ）霍勞徹支（Herwilz)二氏所設之湯氏基金，（ThompsonStarretFoundation)捐贈於麻省理工大學（MassachusettsInbtituteofTechnology)耶魯大學（YaleUniversity)聯合大學(UnionCollege)，指定開設建築學科之用。除上述基金外，霍氏夫婦並另設奬金，贈與三大學成績優良之畢業生，願從事建築，而在紐約之湯浦遜史蒂拉公司（ＴhompsonStarretCo)經過指定之實習者。茲求明起見，將三大學建築工程敎育之實施，概譯如，以爲借鑑。</p>
<h3 id="c240">石工設計（麻省理工大學學生練習之一） <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>一。麻省理工大學</p>
<p>麻省理工大學爲美國著名理工大學之一。該大學之建築學系爲校内十七科學及工程學科所合併而成。此科成爲獨立學院尙在一九二六年，當時學生僅得十七人，至今已極爲發逹。主其事者爲透克敎授（Prof,Ross,F,Tucker)學業期爲四年。關於建築方面之一般學科，莫不備具無遺。學生於第一學年於各學科施以基本的訓練，第二學年起，對於住屋建築即作實地之探討。第三學年從事於實業廠屋之建築。第一步爲简單的　　椿基設計（麻省理工大學生習之二）</p>
<p>磗石木材之廠屋建築，然後再循序進至水泥之建築。第四學年進展至鋼骨之商業房屋建築。敎授於演講至某一階段後。將敎材大綱分發學生，命各生於一星期内用本人見解，擬具報吿，繳還敎授；俟評閲後再行發還。此法於修業年限内贯澈始終，永不間斷，故各生於畢業時，即可集往日報告，彙輯成帙，作爲一種絕好的永久參考資料。此種敎授法之實施，係在餋成學生能有自動的發明的能力，以及健全之評判或鑑賞，藉此並可使往昔敎材不致遺忘，永鐫腦際。此外於口試筆試亦按時舉行。試騐範圍包括古今建築，故學生對於現代及已往建築均須有相當瞭解及影象。畢業生受學士位，並可得上述之霍氏獎金。</p>
<p>該大學對於建築材料之㈠來源㈡品質㈢用處㈣採購四點，予以特别注意，此亦即吾人所應加注意者。建築學科與其他工程學科之不同，或亦基於此。一般建築科或工科畢業生，對於建築栈料一點，每加忽略，而無尃長之研究，此實爲彼輩前途進展之極大阻礙。要知建築材料譬猶人身之骨幹，爲形成整個建築物之原素。有時此輩畢業生旣投身建築界或對於建築有關之其他事業，彼輩所能努力或注意者，僅爲工程之設計或實施。至於實質問題，（建築材料）每因在學生時代漠視之結果，至此又須重下功夫，費相當時間加以研究及考察，而後對於上述四點始能略悉一二。此外該大學敎學目的並在餋成思想靈敏動作迅捷之人才。蓋建築上一難間發生，自應當機立斷，不能遲疑。而一建築家處於叢脞粉紜之環鏡中，實亦無暇猶豫之可能也。彼時建築　　步驟或過程，自必瞭然心目之中，於施工説明書或結搆之視察，尤須有决斷評判之能力。彼此時固不能携带參考書以作實地之比較也。一建築家所具學識常須應用，無或間斷：故該大學之敎育方法，實重於「學以致用」者也！</p>
<p>二耶魯大學</p>
<p>耶魯大學之建築學科附屬於雪佛爾科學院内。（SheldScientificSchoolofYaleUni.)兹將各學年課程之分配。概述如下：</p>
<p>㈠大學一年級第一學年所有課程，與其他大學之工科相似。如：英文，歴史，化學，數學，工程畫等。若一年級各學科均能及格通過，則升至二年級時，即可不生困難矣。</p>
<p>㈡大學二年級第二學年所有課程</p>
<p>，尙爲基本科目，以爲下年再求深造之準備。計有：物理，工程力學，數學，工程畫及英文等。</p>
<p>㈢大學三年級至第三學年，所有課程始與其學工科不同。在第一學期對於物理等仍加相當注意，而結構計劃則在全部學科中佔有極重要之地位。經濟學概讑，及建築學入門列爲必脩學科。他於建築學原理，係尃讑建築材料，建築比較，標準設計等，亦爲至第二學期時所必脩者。</p>
<h3 id="c241">耶魯大學學生課外工作之一 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>㈣大學四年級　至第四學年所不學科趨於實習之傾向，如鋼骨水泥建築等，均極注意。學生在此時均從事於建築之設計及實施工作圖樣之準備。因使學生於畢業後便利業務起見，故對於商業方面之學科亦予相當注意。在第一學期授以會計學原理等科，第二學期則有工程管理契約研究説明書研究等。傍如工程估價，成本分析等均加以注意，務使學者於理論上及實際上對於現代建築學術均能有良好之認識。</p>
<p>此外耶魯大學學生對於暑期工作極爲注重。在四學年之修業年限中，其間有暑假三次，每次給假四星期。建築科學生即利用此時間至外實習。第一屆暑期（即第一學年與第二學年間之暑期，下類推。）從事於平面測量。第二屆暑期進至地形測量TopographicSutveying第三屆暑期，則由敎授領導，出外參觀　　朱森記營造廠承造之榮金大戲院建築時之攝影</p>
<p>及考察，其範圍如營造廠，建築事務所，材料試騐室，建築材料製造廠等，使學生能明白整個建築界之組織，及其活動狀况。</p>
<p>上述各學年各種學科之實施，尙爲一種機械的訓練。此外學校當局並努力養成學生能具有遠大之觀點，不使拘囿於一隅，以免坐井觀天之譏。學生對於建築學科之科之注意自不待言，他如語言文字，審美觀念，均須有相當之研究及修養：而對於本身所處地位之重要，及畢業後就業之準備，皆宜愼重考慮者也。</p>
<h3 id="c242">三聯合大學 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>此大學之建築工程科，係湯氏基金所最初捐贈設立者。修業年限四年。在第一學年與第二學年之間，授以一般建築學科，如製圖。測量數學，英文等。第三學年授以力學，經濟學，鐵道建築，水力學，以及其他與建築有直接關係學科，自上年起，並添設建築材料及建築形式二學程。學生每練習將圖樣之一</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>部作實地之估價··有時或從事於改造舊有建築之設計。課餘有睱，則練習機械之使用，房屋中全副鉛管之設置，及電氣工程之設計等。此外如椿基骨架等均極注意。</p>
<p>聯合大學所開設課程中，對於結構一課，不拘理論與實踐，均較其他爲重視。此外於經濟學會計學公司瑞財CorporationFince等課，亦極注意，蓋預備異業生於出外就業時，對於理財方面無格格不入之憾也。</p>
<p>四其他</p>
<p>上述湯氏基金除捐贈三大學建築工程學科外，霍氏夫婦在卡那基理工大學CarnegieInstituteTechnogy亦捐贈相當基金，培植建築人才。主持者爲鄧南敎授。Prof.CliffordG.Dunnejis開設學程·對於建築工程之理論與實踐並加注意。此大學以培育人才之宗旨，在養成學生能有獨當一面之執行人才。學科如數學，物理，化學，力學，結構原理等，傍如木工，磚石工，電工，機械工學等之實騐，按時舉行，使學生於實騐無畸視之弊。測量學科爲必修學程。第二學年與第三學年間之暑期，須出外實習。此外各生並於課外參觀正在進行之建築工程，以資實地觀察，補充敎材之不足；藉此並可濬發新思，自行貫通也。</p>
<h3 id="c243">公共娱樂的建築丨建設完美城市的要素丨 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 宗文</p>
<p>現在社會上的一般人士，大家對於娱樂一件事，太不注意了！而他們所謂的娱樂，只不過是些不正當的··如賭博以及打麻雀之類，把寳貴的光陰，消遣消遣罷了。這是多麽的危險丨其害委實非淺丨這也就是我們中國積弱原因之一。本報業餘週刋第二期上面，也萍君的一篇「業餘娱樂與打麻雀」中，把這種不正當娱樂之害，可算已說得很透澈的了丨但是爲什麽一般人對於正當的娱樂，反而忽視呢？考其原因，却在於因爲市内公共娱樂的建築太少的緣故；即使有，也不過是些私人的有的·故不能普遍於一般大衆。那麽，因其這樣，結果當然使市内的一般民衆們，不去注意了。因此我們要使社會上的人廢去不正當的娱樂，非從市内多建設公共娱樂的建築極司非而路中之吳公館由新　營造廠承造現建築工程正在進行中入手有可丨但是我們怎樣去設計公共娱樂的建築呢？這就是我現在所要談的。　　講到公共娱樂的建築，其種類當然很多··如花園啊丨運動塲啊丨草地啊丨戲院啊丨······等類。因這一些的建築，</p>
<p>足以使人民發生興趣，助長精神，使人身康健，並能養成一般愛美的心理··當然哩丨其益殊多丨但看看我們老大的中國，關於這一類公共娱樂的建築，委實太少了丨即以繁華甲於全國的上海而論，除掉了一般私人所有的娱樂建築以外，公共娱樂的建築，眞是絕無僅有丨這眞是可憐極了丨试看歐美各國素重人民愉快事業，在各處大小城市中，十字街頭，總有幾方草地公園建設着，以供行人休息之用；（上海祇有外灘一帶才有，也不過聊以點綴而已）且設施各種公共游戲塲、，如跳舞廳，公園，游泳池，等當然，這又對於城市風光，生色不少丨可稱爲「美的城市」因其這樣，足以養成一般强健的國民，締造各種事業，而國家亦因而强盛。由此，我們知道，公共娱樂建築的設施，又爲建設完美城市中的要素，非此不足表示城市的美。所以在城市計劃中，關於公共娱樂建設的一種計劃，亦不可缺少。試觀我們中國，因這類建築太少的緣故··因此，一般人民無正當娱樂的消遣，精神因而困頓，釀成生活的痛苦。要知精神爲人生之生活要素；有之，則事無不舉··缺之，則一無能爲；這就是中國人民積弱之唯一大原因‘以上把公共娱樂建築的重要，已述其大槪；現在再來談談公共悮樂建築的設施罷丨</p>
<p>先來談公園，按公園可分爲二種··　　㈠市外天然公園。　　㈡市内公園。　　市外天然公，係就市外約二三里遠近之間，有林木或山水之勝處，修飾而成。這是利用天然的風景而造成的。此種公園祇須購買山林數處，再建造通城市的大路數條，故所費爲較省。但此類公園之建築，必須隣近城市爲宜··如市城四週無此等自然之風景，那麽，當然此類之公園不適宜，而要建築第二種市内公園了。丨如上海當然適合於第二種，因隣近四週沒有此等自然原風景哩丨</p>
<p>市内公園，係完全用人工而建築成的。须合美術的條件，才能使游客發生興趣；然此等市内公園，又可分爲二類··（Ａ）人造大草地。丨四週環植各種樹木，旁設游椅，以供游覽者休憩怡情；並在其中植奇花異草，俾消遣者動好奇之感想，而生審美的觀念。此種小公園，宜、建設在貿易繁盛之區，建設愈多愈佳。（如杭州西子湖邊之湖濱公園，便是一個很好的例子）。（Ｂ）市内人造公園。丨此種公園大於草地公園花木座位當然所應有；且内中尙有假山，亭子，以及小湖之類，更須附設各種公共娱樂的建築物，如網球，足球場，游泳池，跳舞廳，小考而富球塲，以及，各種有</p>
<p>紐絲綸永安森林公司所種植之軟木十五年後之攝影樹幹週圍五尺八寸高約七十五尺益於市民們的陳設。（如上海城内之文廟公園，與租界上各種公園，便是幾個很好的例子）。此種公園，每城至少須建二處。而内地尤宜提倡，並多應設立。因爲内地之土地，當然比城市爲賤，並且内地尤多一般勞苦的同胞，以及農民等，且智識低微，更應提倡高尙之娱樂，以調劑一般平民枮燥而無味的生活。這是一件很重要的事，關於國家前途實在大有影響啊！我們豈可忽視。</p>
<p>游戲塲以及戲院等，亦爲公共娱樂建築之一，但一種含有營業性質的，並且又爲私人之建築，因此不須公衆去建设，不過提導指導罷了。但我們在計劃城市時，應將私人之建築地劃出，才能不與其他地界混亂。如在工廠區域中，不應該設有戲園。在商業區域，則可多設如戲院等類的公共娱樂場所，以助營業之發達。在住宅區域，亦應多設戲院，以供住民正當的娱樂。這些，是我們在計劃城市的建設中，所不可不注意的。</p>
<p>此外如建設公共運動場，健身房等，亦是不可少的；無論城，鎭，鄉，村，都要設立的。因爲這是人民體育的中心點，娱樂上不可缺少的工具！按歐美各國之學校運動場，多准人民及兒童自由入内運動，但我們中國確實相反，因此學府未免貴族化，因爲人民不能輕易入内去運動啊！但我極希望學校當局，有所覺悟，而將操場自由開放，以利市民。否則在城市中宜多設立公共運動場，無論大小，但總以全市的人民及兒童婦女之多寡爲比例，而照此分配，各自建設；這對於市民的健康問題，關係殊大，我們又豈可忽視的！</p>
<p>總而言之，公共娱樂建築的設施方法，至不必須合符以下的五條條件才可！</p>
<p>㈠公共娱樂的設備，必須完美，尤其特别注意兒童的及婦女方面的。</p>
<p>㈡地址須處於城市的中心地點，並交通尤應便利。</p>
<p>㈢不取資丨即或取資，也宜取最低限度的費。</p>
<p>㈣須合於羣衆的須要，但不可迎合社會的低級惡心理。</p>
<p>㈤聘請相當的人員，隨時指道和監察。</p>
<p>建設去！我們努力建設公共娱樂的建築！</p>

<p>— 爾明</p>
<p>橋梁在橋址上之建築方法，得依橋梁之情形及當地之便利而異，可分爲用浮架與不用浮架二種。</p>
<p>浮架法普通之鋼架橋梁建築，如當地可以搭建浮架，自當以用浮架爲宜，他如石拱橋及三和土拱橋之須有連續不斷之支座者，亦須搭建浮架，至於浮架之更於搭建與否，則視乎河底之能否打椿，航行之有無妨碍，發水時期有無困難，及河水是否甚深，河面有無木排與浮冰之飄流而定。</p>
<p>普通之單軌鋼架橋建築宜於有浮架，每架以椿木四條爲之，於架梁橋每一聯接點之下用一架，聯接點之間再用若干架·架之闊度須使於兩邊鋼橋架梁位置之外，尙能安裝鋼軌各一道　，以爲起重架行走於上之用·起重架爲一覆形U字之架·能吊起橋梁之各部·行使於兩軌之上，安放於相當之處所，此種起重架用於跨度二百五十呎以上之橋梁，至爲適宜，若短小之橋梁，則可不用行動式之起重架，而用在橋内部行駛之起重機，至於建築鋼架橋之次序，普通先裝承軌梁及橫染，然後至主要兩架，但因欲避免河水之泛濫，冲崩浮架，而欲於較知時間，先完成主要架梁，則可將上述次序變更之，石拱橋或三和土拱橋所需浮架之建築，較之普在架梁橋尤爲重要而困難，一則以拱形之架較難做，二則以拱橋處受有重力，不若架梁橋受重之聚於聯接點，故拱橋浮架須有繼續不斷之承托，且於完工取落浮架時，尤須小心，務使各部分同時慢慢脫落，俾橋之各部同時接受壓力，</p>
<p>不用浮架法　若河流之情形不容許有浮架之建築，則可將橋身在他處用船數只載之，拖至橋址，然後移上橋墩，如此則雖障碍交通若干時，然就橋工論，自屬简便也。</p>
<p>若河流旣不容有浮架，而船之移轉又有不便時，則以用翅橋法建築爲最简單，其法從兩岸造起，逐漸伸向中心，至相接時則將兩半聯成之，然本非翅橋，而用翅橋法建築，必須另行計算橋　各部在建築時之應力，其應力有與原來之應力相反而抵消者，亦有相同而合併者，如是則用料亦須酌爲加多，此爲翅橋法建築之不經濟處，但以其方法之简便，除翅橋本身自可適用外，他如並通式橋及拱橋亦多用之。</p>
<p>不用浮架法，亦可與浮架法混合參用，如一長橋有若干之跨度，則若可用浮架法，若者可用翅橋法，可就地研究定之，</p>
<p>通常之板橋建築，大抵不須浮架，祇須用起重機，於一岸上吊起，而置於適當之地位也。</p>
<p>橋梁之建築，須頓有良工良具，方能時速而費省，而上述各建築法中，以何者爲適用，有時亦以有無此良工與良具爲斷，若缺乏此兩種便利，則必甚費經營也。</p>

<p>We Request Amendments to the Five-Power Draft</p>
<p>Japanese Side Lacks Sincerity for Reconciliation</p>
<p>Insists on Recognition of the Puppet State as a Precondition</p>
<p>There Is Talk of the Spanish Representative Being Recalled Due to Anti-Japanese Stance</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Drafting Committee will meet this afternoon. Instructions from both the Chinese and Japanese governments have arrived. Because the draft resolution is based on Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report, and also takes into account Chapter 10, the Japanese representative verbally notified the League of Nations that Japan cannot agree with the Lytton recommendations and has expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the issue of Japan's insistence on recognizing (Manchukuo) as a precondition for mediation has not been clearly resolved. The League of Nations instructed the Japanese representative to submit a written statement, and the Japanese representative requested instructions from Tokyo. The returned instructions arrived yesterday evening and were forwarded to the League of Nations (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th).</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese representative visited the chairman of the Drafting Committee today, stating China's views on the draft resolution and requesting amendments. From the looks of things, Japan clearly lacks sincerity, and the pursuit of reconciliation will be futile. People around the world who sympathize with China are puzzled by the gradual relaxation of China's efforts in economic self-defense (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th).</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese government's instructions to its representative arrived only this afternoon. Translation takes time, and it could not be submitted today, so the Drafting Committee did nothing. It adjourned at 6:30 tonight and decided to reconvene at 3:30 PM on Sunday. Czech representative Mr. Pelnar has departed for Prague, and Swedish representative Mr. Undén will attend in his place. The Committee of Nineteen will not make any progress until the Japanese instructions have been discussed. It is widely expected that while Japan will strongly oppose certain parts of the draft resolution proposed by the Drafting Committee, it will not completely close the door to mediation. Furthermore, the declaration of the Chinese spokesperson should not be regarded as China's final word. It is now learned that the remarks of the Chinese spokesperson are even firmer than initially reported. The final sentence reads, "What is indispensable is that Japan must abandon the so-called 'Manchukuo' before we can have any mediation." With Christmas only days away and many important figures involved in these negotiations, it is widely expected that the entire matter will be adjourned on Tuesday until mid-January for further discussion, possibly without requiring a closing meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly or the Special Committee of Nineteen. Those involved feel that this type of adjournment will give both sides time for careful consideration, and it is expected that work can proceed more quickly when negotiations resume at a later date. Spanish representative Mr. Madariaga is scheduled to return to his country on Sunday. There is a rumor that the Spanish government does not approve of his strong and unwavering attitude and plans to temporarily replace him with Mr. Zulueta as the Spanish representative to the Special Committee of Nineteen in order to adopt a more flexible approach. It is said that Mr. Madariaga will not be able to return to Geneva until after January 1st, which suggests that this rumor may not be entirely unfounded. Since the President of the League of Nations General Assembly and the Special Committee of Nineteen, Mr. Hymans, returned to his country, Mr. Carton has been acting as chairman. Now that Mr. Carton has been appointed Minister of Social Affairs in the new Belgian cabinet, he will depart for Belgium tonight. Mr. Hymans, who has now been appointed Belgian Foreign Minister, will arrive in Geneva on Wednesday. If the League of Nations General Assembly convenes at that time, Mr. Hymans will remain as chairman, but this arrangement may change, as it remains uncertain whether a meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly can be held before Christmas (Reuters dispatch from the 17th).</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese delegation has stated that it cannot accept the draft resolution of the Committee of Nineteen, and Japan also plans to request amendments. Therefore, several parties here today believe that the Committee may not be able to complete its work by January next year. Today, a spokesperson for the Chinese delegation declared that there can be no compromise until Japan withdraws from Manchuria. It is also reported that Yosuke Matsuoka, after reading the draft resolution, has reported to the Japanese government that the Committee may accept proposed amendments, but that this move will further delay the progress of the case (National News Agency dispatch from the 17th).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida entered the Imperial Palace at 3:15 PM yesterday to report to the Emperor on the draft resolution passed by the Special Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations, as well as the government's instructions to the Japanese delegation in Geneva regarding the matter. It is reported that the Japanese government advocates amending the parts of the resolution that Japan cannot accept. If the Special Committee of Nineteen does not accept these amendments, the Japanese delegation plans to vote against the resolution (Reuters dispatch from the 18th).</p>

They stated that in order to stabilize the situation in the Far East, it is necessary to first stabilize the politics of Manchuria. The stability of Manchurian politics lies in recognizing the puppet state. Recognition of the puppet state is fundamental to peace in the Far East. Japan cannot agree to any resolution that opposes the independence of the puppet state. They solemnly declare this as the media (Hua Lian dispatch from the 18th).</p>

Yesterday, there was talk about Sun Ke being transferred to the position of President of the Control Yuan and Yu Youren being transferred to the Legislative Yuan, but no decision was made. Furthermore, the replacement of Ye Gongchuo in the Railway Ministry has not been agreed upon, and Zhu Jiaju has a good chance of continuing in his position as Minister of Communications.

Because guerrillas were discovered in the Sanbao Camp area, the Japanese used this as an excuse to open fire and provoke. Our troops stationed at Koubeiyingzi are on high alert. The Japanese army returned to Nanling after we did not retaliate. Our army has increased troops in Jianping and Lingyuan, and the defense line is solid. The guerrillas in Qinghemen, Shijiazi, and Hongtazi have risen up to resist Japan, and the outcry is very strong (Special dispatch from the 18th).</p>

<h3 id="e27">The Golden Dream of Japan's Declining National Power Dims <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Japan relies on its military force, disregards international credibility, and destroys international conventions. It considers itself exceptionally clever. It first used the name "extraordinary period" to fool its people, and then borrowed "armed self-defense" to carry out its aggression against China. It believes it has a dominating spirit and acts rampantly everywhere. However, what is the situation within its own country? Since the second implementation of the ban on gold exports on December 13th of last year, Japan's domestic cash reserves have been decreasing month by month. By the end of last month, it only had 420 million yen in cash. This is the result of implementing a monetary inflation policy. The banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan have increased by nearly 100 million yen. General special prices have increased dramatically. (According to a survey by the Bank of Japan) Wholesale price index:</p>
<p>January 1932: 159.5; April 1932: 154.1; July 1932: 147.7; September 1932: 167.4; October 1932: 169.1; November 1932: 176.9</p>
<p>Since prices have gradually risen, the market should become increasingly prosperous. This seems undoubtedly true according to general theoretical deduction. The Japanese authorities are also proud of this, believing that the countries of England, America, France, and Germany have been affected by the world economic panic and have not been able to extricate themselves. At most, they have only just seen the bottom and are gradually turning around. Japan, on the other hand, is soaring upwards, and market prosperity can be achieved with a snap of the fingers. However, the facts show that, first of all, in agriculture, the income of farmers, who account for 51% of the total population, depends 65% to 70% on rice and silkworm cocoons. The results have not been good in the past three or four years. The bumper harvest of 1930 led to disaster, and the poor harvest of 1931 led to panic. This year, rice prices have also not improved. Spring silkworms are facing a drop in raw silk prices. Although the income from summer and autumn silkworm cocoons has slightly eased their worries, their market price is only half of what it was in 1929. Farmers are unable to repay their debts, so how can they have the surplus to cultivate the land and increase production that is insufficient to repay the principal? As for urban workers and the population who depend on wages for their livelihood, numbering 16.7 million, how much benefit have they gained from the high prices? Whether their consumption ability has increased is a major issue at present. The employment rate and wage index of workers are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e28">Staffing Rate and Actual Wage Rate <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Average for the first half of 1932: 73.8, 88.0; July 1932: 74.5, 86.2; August 1932: 74.7, 86.1 According to the simple figures above, it can be seen that although the number of Japanese workers employed has slightly increased, the actual wages received have decreased instead. Coupled with rising prices, the hardship of life is evident from these simple figures. Therefore, social unrest and the panic of the people cannot be compensated for by capturing cities and seizing land in their precarious situation. What is even more serious is that from August to the end of November this year, postal savings have sharply decreased, reaching a huge amount of 144 million yen. Up to the 10th of this month alone, it has decreased by more than 16 million. By the end of the year, it is feared that it will decrease again to 170 to 180 million yen. Due to the decrease in savings, the planned loan projects cannot be implemented. For example, the real estate financing loan was originally planned for 100 million yen, but now only 10 million can be lent out. The planned loan of 30 million by credit cooperatives to make fixed funds flow is now only 10 million yen actually lent out. Recently, requests for loans for disaster recovery funds and fertilizer loans in Hokkaido are expected to be above 300 million yen. Given Japan's current financial situation, how can such a huge amount of funds be met other than by issuing more inconvertible banknotes?</p>
<p>Realistically speaking, it is still possible to further inflate the currency and issue one or two hundred million banknotes. However, the cash reserves are too weak, and the foreign exchange rate will fall further, which would greatly benefit exports and stimulate production, which would have good results. However, on the import side, whether it is American cotton or Indian cotton, there would be a major impact. The precedent of Germany is a warning. Fiscal bankruptcy is a concern.</p>
<p>Moreover, Japan's national treasury is empty, and aggression continues. Revenue is scarce, and the market is shrinking. The urgency of military expenses is like a raging fire. The poverty of the people is like dried fish. Therefore, in the midst of an economically dead end, there is a craze for seeking "gold." Some say that there is hidden gold in the mountains of Taiwan. Therefore, the Japanese government and even the business community have specially sent personnel to investigate. After a year of fruitless searching, a strange idea has recently emerged: to salvage the "gold" carried by a certain Russian warship sunk at the bottom of the sea. They have even organized a gold-seeking company, hoping to make a windfall. They are particularly enthusiastic about exploring gold mines in the Heilongjiang region and in certain areas of Hokkaido. Japan claims to be the world's strongman, but it wants to get rich by chance to overcome its current financial difficulties and supplement its aggression expenses. Even if gold were as common as iron, how could it fill the barrels of guns and kill my Chinese people to compensate for my land with bullets?</p>
<p>It must be known that the Chinese are not willing to be slaves. The ambition of self-salvation has never been forgotten. A century of struggle has only just begun. The final battle is yet to come. But the Japanese are already stretched thin, searching everywhere for "gold" to alleviate their crisis. Can we not strive to break the golden dream of this militaristic demon?</p>

He also said that Sun Ke's proposal to concentrate national power to save the country in times of crisis, Chapter 6 of the entire chapter, stated that the navy should focus on building submarines to serve the purpose of national defense in times of distress and that military vessels that are not suitable for national defense should be stopped from being built and should be converted into merchant ships as appropriate. He said that the proposal to build submarines for national defense is indeed very necessary, and he deeply sympathizes with it. However, the construction of national defense warships is completely different from that of merchant ships and should not be converted for commercial use. He also said that at a time when our country's finances are stretched, building submarines requires a large amount of money and is quite difficult. Our country has vast rivers and seas, and if submarines are used, there must be more than 200 ships. Each ship should be built with 900 tons, costing about 10 million yuan, and the construction cost of 200 ships would require a total of 300 million yuan. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e59">Spain Increases Army Budget <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Provoking Opposition from People Nationwide</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 17th: Today, the Spanish Ministry of the Army announced the military budget for next year, which is 36 million Spanish currency more than this year's 38.7 million. This has caused a huge wave of protest in the newspapers across the country. Most newspapers generally believe that if this budget can be passed in the National Assembly, it should be considered treasonous, because the government had already declared to the people its intention to reduce military spending. Furthermore, Spain is now a republic that opposes war and all military actions, and has no reason to provoke conflict with its neighbors, so it is not difficult to vigorously implement military reductions. Moreover, the people of the country are now groaning under the heavy weight of economic oppression. The army's military spending already reaches 42.3 million Spanish currency annually. If the government disregards public opinion and brazenly places a heavy burden on the people again, losing the trust of the people would be extremely foolish.</p>

<p>Tamagawa Practice, Actual Combat, Tachikawa Air Force Team Cheering</p>
<p>China News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: The Japanese Ministry of the Army considers the military training of 2 million soldiers in service and 1 million young people in training camps to be insufficient. This time, it has requested the Ministry of Education to impose strict military training on young people working in companies, shops, and factories. According to Japanese law, there are 2 million young people nationwide who are obligated to receive training in youth training camps. More than one million of them have already entered training camps for training. More than one million others are serving in society and have not had the opportunity. However, the Ministry of Education, due to limited funds and time, has not been able to agree. The Ministry of the Army advocates that each company and factory establish training facilities with private funds and allocate a certain amount of time each week for military training, guided by instructors sent by the Ministry of the Army. However, capitalists have not been able to give a definite answer due to concerns about work and expenses. The military's eagerness to train troops is intended to reorganize the army's manpower, making it more numerous than the combined forces of China and Russia.</p>
<p>China News Agency, Tokyo: The Japanese military regards the more than one million students in youth training camps as the Second National Defense Force. Since the September 18th Incident, training has become more strict. On December 11th, exercises were conducted at the Tamagawa Training Ground in Tokyo Prefecture. The Eastern Army, with more than 1,100 people, was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Takahashi, and the Western Army, with more than 1,130 people, was commanded by Major Nomura, stationed on both banks. They practiced bayonet fighting using heavy and light machine guns. The Air Force dispatched two aircraft from Tachikawa to assist in the battle. Tokyo Prefecture Governor Kosaka, Division Commander Hayashi, and many junior officers all went to the battlefield to watch the battle. The exercise lasted about six hours before dispersing.</p>

<p>Havas, Paris, 17th: How to clear up the debts owed by the former governments of the Three Eastern Provinces has become a problem. Regarding this matter, the Japanese Embassy has recently received news from Tokyo. Previously, the administrative organs of the Three Eastern Provinces owed large debts to locals and foreigners for purchasing goods and borrowing money. Creditors from the United States, Britain, Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and others have requested the "Manchukuo" government to repay these debts, totaling more than 12 million yuan. The clearing committee established in Shenyang has studied and investigated them. Since August of this year, the (puppet) government has continued to proceed. Of the total debt, 7,110,000 yuan has already been delivered, and this amount will be repaid in cash at 35 percent before July 1933, with another 20 percent repaid the following year. The remaining 45 percent will be repaid with treasury bonds with an interest rate of three percent, with the principal repaid after 20 years. For those that have only been contracted but not yet delivered, if they still cannot be delivered by 1939, the losses suffered in each case will be examined and settled with the same treasury bonds.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Dumping of Russian Goods in Our Country Causing Panic Among Japanese Businesses <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>China News Agency, Osaka, 18th: Osaka merchants received news from Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangdong that after receiving news of the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Chinese businesses in various places have completely changed their attitude towards Japanese goods. In the past, many unscrupulous merchants risked secretly dealing in Japanese goods, but recently they have been very cold towards Japanese goods and have turned to selling Russian goods. This trend is very worrying. It is heard that there is a plan to open a regular shipping route between Shanghai and Vladivostok. If this plan is successful, the impact on Japanese goods will be significant. Therefore, Japanese businesses involved in trade with China have held secret meetings for days to study countermeasures, but because Russian goods are cheap, there is no solution.</p>
<h3 id="e66">US Senate Passes Philippine Independence Bill <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Twelve Years as a Trial Period, First Granted Autonomous Status</p>
<p>Expected that the President May Not Approve</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, December 17th - The United States Senate has been debating the Philippine independence issue for several days. Today, it passed an amendment that would grant the Philippines independence within twelve years. Previously, it had been proposed that the Philippines be granted independence after eighteen years, and later someone suggested changing eighteen years to eight years. Therefore, today's amendment is a compromise solution.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, December 17th - Today, the U.S. Senate, with unexpected speed, passed the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Philippine Independence Act by a large majority. It will immediately be transferred to a joint House-Senate conference committee to reconcile it with the Hare Act passed by the House in the previous session. After adjustments, it will be submitted to both houses for adoption. According to original proposer Hawes' guarantee, this bill can be put to a final vote in both houses before the Christmas holiday. The bill passed by the Senate today includes the Broussard Amendment, which stipulates that the Philippines be granted independence after twelve years. However, the Philippines must convene a constitutional convention within two years to draft a constitution. This constitution must be approved by the U.S. Congress and the U.S. President. From the date this bill is finally established until the U.S. approves its implementation of independence, the intervening period will be granted the status of an autonomous territory. Although Filipinos can have a more autonomous government, they will not be able to trade with the United States completely tax-free, nor will they be allowed to immigrate to Honolulu and the United States without restriction. The most obvious difference between this bill and the Hare Act is the length of the transition period. The Hare Act only stipulated eight years, but many in the Senate believe that this point is easy to compromise. Other provisions include asking the President to negotiate treaties with various countries to guarantee the Philippines' freedom, and restricting the import of Philippine goods and the immigration of Philippine workers. The differences are only minor details. However, even if this bill is passed by both houses, it is expected that President Hoover will veto it. But it is believed that both houses will still have sufficient votes to overturn Hoover's veto, because Hoover and Stimson, etc., all believe that Filipinos currently lack sufficient political training and should not lightly risk the dangers of autonomy. They also believe that the Philippines should not break away from American rule until its economy is independent. However, the Senate's passage of this bill is not purely based on ideals. Its main intention is to help American agriculture, the Cuban sugar industry, and American labor, in order to reduce Philippine competition. Therefore, both the Republican and Democratic parties currently have supporters of independence. So, once Philippine independence becomes a reality, the economic recession is indeed a major driving force behind it.</p>

<p>China United Press, Tokyo, December 18th - The 64th session of the Japanese Parliament is about to be convened on the 23rd. The attitude of the Upper House is gradually becoming clear, and the general trend is to support the Saitō Cabinet. The reasons are: 1) No matter who is in power during this crisis, their countermeasures would be similar. 2) The situation in the League of Nations is still chaotic and cannot withstand major changes. 3) Takahashi's financial policy is currently a last resort, and Finance Minister Takahashi is also planning remedial measures. Let's see what his countermeasures are. Because the Upper House has this kind of atmosphere, the political situation may not change much. The main points of discussion in the Upper House will focus on: 1) What are the results after the implementation of agricultural relief policies? 2) Is there a remedy for the unlimitedly growing finances?</p>

<p>Dentsu, Kyoto, December 18th - In the area around Oku-Kujo in Kyoto, there is a noble woman driving a taxi, frequently calling for customers, which is quite eye-catching. Her background has become a topic of conversation among Kyoto residents. After investigation, it was learned that she is Mrs. Ritsuko Ebisawa, 32 years old, wife of Torazo Ebisawa, assistant professor of economics at Kyoto Imperial University. Mrs. Ritsuko, seeing that her husband is immersed in research and does not engage in production, secretly practiced and obtained a taxi driver's license. She works as a taxi driver during the day to earn a living and as a housewife at night to manage the household, hoping to assist her husband in completing his studies.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, December 17th - The U.S. government has allocated $418 million as a reserve for public debt repayment. Therefore, the deficit for this fiscal year will increase to $1.142 billion. The income tax revenue from July 1st to December 15th was only $236 million, while it was $407 million during the same period last year.</p>

<p>The Manchurian Problem and the League of Nations (5)</p>
<p>Verbal Sparring Between the Chinese and Japanese Representatives in the Commission of Enquiry</p>
<p>Japan cannot turn a blind eye to any disturbances in any part of East Asia, because the spirit of the Japanese Empire cannot coexist with disturbances. Every Japanese citizen should be prepared spiritually and materially at all times to restore stability, even resorting to force if necessary." This article by Araki embodies the spirit and scope of Japanese policy. As for its implementation methods, we can get a general idea by looking at the records of Mutsu Munemitsu, the Japanese Foreign Minister during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. Mutsu Munemitsu's position during the Sino-Japanese War was extremely important. The cause of the Sino-Japanese War has been a point of contention in general public opinion for decades. After the publication of Okuriku's records, the doubts began to subside, because Japan's responsibility for forcing China to fight became undeniable. Around June 1894, a large number of Japanese army and navy troops were dispatched to Korea, led by Keisuke Oshima, the Japanese ambassador to Korea. At that time, the situation in Korea was gradually stabilizing, and the plan to wage war against China seemed unlikely to be realized immediately. Mutsu urgently telegraphed Oshima, saying that the time for decisive action had arrived and that any excuse could be used to start active operations. The main principle of Japanese policy, as Mutsu said, was that "in military operations, Japan should strike first, but at the same time, it should try to create a situation in which general observers believe that Japan's actions were taken out of necessity."</p>
<p>What was true of Korea in the past is also true of the three northeastern provinces today. Japan's acts of aggression must have a cause and an excuse. However, regardless of whether this cause and excuse can be accepted by the world, Japan must achieve its goal of aggression. Page 77 of the Commission of Enquiry report states, "After Japan filed its reservations in Geneva, it continued to handle the situation in the three northeastern provinces according to its plan." Is this not solid proof? Japan has protested several times about the Chinese people's economic severance with Japan. I only wish to add some comments to the report's interesting statement. Economic severance is just a method of self-defense. Economic severance is only a reaction to external fixed causes and is by no means something that China can restrain. In the past twenty-five years, there have been nine boycott movements against Japanese goods by the Chinese people. Page 115 of the report states, "If this kind of economic severance movement is studied in detail, it is known that each movement is related to a certain confirmed fact event or incident. These events are generally political in nature and are often considered by China to be harmful to its substantial interests or to its national prestige. Therefore, the economic severance of 1931 was directly caused by the Wanbaoshan Incident in June of the same year and the massacre of Koreans in July, and the Shenyang Incident in September of the same year and the Shanghai Incident in January 1932 further intensified it." What should be pointed out here is that the tragic massacre of overseas Chinese in Korea lasted for ten days, from July 3 to July 13, 1931. The massacre sites were all in Korean towns. As a result of the massacre, 147 innocent overseas Chinese died, 546 were injured, 91 were missing, and property losses exceeded Japanese yen 4,000,000.00. At the time of the incident, the Japanese police neither instructed nor stopped it. The Japanese army's attack on Shanghai, the rich center of China in a large East Asian port, killed and injured 24,000 Chinese and destroyed property worth 150 million yuan. And at present, the lives of Chinese people being killed and the property being destroyed in the three northeastern provinces is even more incalculable. Although Shanghai is the center of economic severance activities, after the people of Shanghai heard about the fact that the Japanese army in the three northeastern provinces was fighting without declaring war, they suffered all kinds of pain for five weeks from February to March. Looking at the fact that after the Japanese army withdrew from Shanghai in May, they immediately transferred to the Northeast to continue their killing work, can we still blame them for not taking this retaliatory measure? When I was in Harbin with the Commission of Enquiry in mid-May of this year, I witnessed the 14th Division of the Japanese Army, which was transferred from Shanghai to Harbin, marching past the avenue outside the hotel where I was staying, and the sound of artillery fire and gunfire often entered my ears. I didn't know how many innocent compatriots were killed in a day and a night, but there was no way to stop this tragedy. In this situation, can't we imagine how the people in other central areas of China feel about the tragic fate of their compatriots? The Chinese people's economic severance movement was started and continued to resist the atrocities of the Japanese army. If we consider these facts, we will know that Chinese people, whether individuals or groups, refuse to purchase Japanese goods and participate in boycott activities in order to obtain sufficient effectiveness. They know that their motherland's military equipment is weak and military equipment is insufficient, so they can only adopt this method of self-control to express their anger at Japan's atrocities against China. Those who boycott Japanese goods, especially merchants, inevitably suffer losses themselves when taking this method. This is a kind of self-sacrifice, and there is absolutely no question of seizing Japanese goods owned by the Japanese people. Sometimes, even if there is a misunderstanding, once the facts are clarified, the goods will be returned to the original owner without any difficulty. In this natural mass movement, of course, no government can completely ignore it. In the eyes of the people, the government is the master who protects the safety of the people and prevents them from being invaded by foreign countries. Therefore, on the one hand, the Chinese government deeply feels the atrocities committed by Japan against China, and on the other hand, it has to express sympathy for these economic severance movements and tolerate them. What's more, economic severance is a legitimate strategy of self-defense, and the government cannot ban it. At the same time, the people are extremely angry at Japan's undeclared war against China, so the government sometimes has to order local authorities to guide the people's sentiments and keep them on a legal track, and also pay close attention to protecting the safety of Japanese residents' lives and property. Since the Japanese invasion of the three northeastern provinces, very few incidents of riots against Japanese residents have occurred in China, which is due to this. The Commission of Enquiry report has already confirmed this point. Some people believe that if the Chinese government formally guides the current organized economic severance against Japan, it seems that the issue of responsibility may be raised. Regarding this point, from the Chinese government's perspective, there is absolutely no responsibility to be held accountable. We believe that any form of resistance is reasonable and legal in the face of Japan's brutal and premeditated military aggression. Although we have submitted this case to the international community for peaceful resolution in accordance with the provisions of the covenant, and are quietly waiting for the results, we cannot but try to prevent the Japanese army from continuing its advance as much as possible to aggravate the seriousness of the situation, fearing that any situation, once created, will be regarded as a fait accompli. Since China has adhered to its policy of peace and tolerance unchanged, it has also adopted this peaceful method of resistance, believing that this kind of pressure on the aggressor country does not involve killing or bloodshed, so it is certainly more humane. Otherwise, if force is used against force, the result of killing and bloodshed will be unavoidable. It is expected that economic severance will have a negative impact on Japan, but compared to the tens of thousands of Chinese lives killed and hundreds of millions of Chinese property destroyed by the Japanese army in the three northeastern provinces, Shanghai, and Tianjin, the difference is worlds apart. In this mass movement aroused by patriotic indignation, sometimes there may be two or three radical people who use methods that are not completely in accordance with strict legal regulations in order to make the movement more effective. However, if we think of the fact that the most prosperous three northeastern provinces of China have been occupied by the Japanese army's unreasonable invasion, then the behavior of these people can also be considered reasonable. May I ask what would happen if any other country were to endure the same atrocities to the point of threatening its survival? Therefore, judging from the current situation, even if the Chinese government declares that the current economic severance against Japan throughout China is legal in order to implement the movement in a more orderly manner, it cannot be said to be completely unreasonable. However, the Chinese government has not yet done this, which shows the moderation and tolerance of its policy. We should pay the most attention to the fact that China's economic severance against Japan is out of helplessness. Although economic severance is a method of resisting the atrocities of the Japanese army, it also causes a lot of damage to the Chinese people themselves. China loves peace and always adheres to a peaceful policy in international disputes, so it also hopes to resolve this Japanese invasion through arbitration. Although Japan is stronger than China in terms of military equipment, it is also a member state of the League of Nations. If it can make any demands on China in accordance with one of the peaceful methods stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant, this is what China most hopes for. However, Japanese soldiers did not plan to do this. From the beginning, they adopted force as their policy and implemented their planned invasion plan. Therefore, from the perspective of the Chinese government, the precise implementation of economic severance against Japan is necessary. Moreover, since the League of Nations' remedial measures take time, this method of resistance cannot be delayed. The experience of the past fourteen months seems to have confirmed the accuracy of this view. The Japanese government has not only failed to fulfill its obligations accepted in the Executive Yuan resolutions of September 30 and December 2 of last year, to withdraw the Japanese army into the South Manchuria Railway Zone, but has intensified its activities. To this day, there is not a single place in the three northeastern provinces that is not under the iron heel of the Japanese army. And the League of Nations, during this long period, has not yet found an effective way to prevent the Japanese army from increasing the severity of the local situation politically or militarily, or to force the Japanese army to fulfill its promise to withdraw into the railway zone in accordance with the resolution's claims. If we do not recognize China's use of economic severance to resist the atrocities of the Japanese army, it is tantamount to not recognizing peaceful and legal self-defense methods. What's more, in the modern world economy, the use of protective tariffs, distribution systems, and restrictions on exchange rates has all been recognized as legal. These methods are still regarded as legal self-defense strategies against economic aggression. Since the nature of China's economic severance is very similar, why can't it be allowed to be used as a self-defense strategy to resist military aggression? As for whether China's economic severance against Japan conflicts with friendship with Japan and treaty obligations, this issue is not worth asking today. To resolve this issue, we must first ask whether Sino-Japanese relations can still be considered friendly under the various atrocities committed by the Japanese government in Korea, where it massacred countless overseas Chinese, and in Manchuria, Shanghai, and other places, where it occupied Chinese territory, killed countless Chinese lives, and destroyed countless Chinese property. Under the circumstances that Japan intends to violate all treaty obligations, should China still strive to fulfill its unilateral obligations? If we obtain an answer to the latter question, then the former question can be omitted. I sincerely hope that the above points will shed some light on the consideration of the issue of China's economic severance against Japan and on the true meaning of this movement. Although China's national ideology has developed extremely rapidly in recent years, it actually has no xenophobic implications. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Headquarters Stipulates Methods, Jiang Zhangji is Appointed as the County Magistrate</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that the Commander-in-Chief Headquarters for Suppressing Bandits in the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui has recently decided to add Lishan County in the area between Huangma and Jingfu Counties in Eastern Hubei in order to facilitate administration. Jiang Zhangji has been appointed as the first county magistrate of the county. Because it is the beginning of the establishment and affairs are complicated, special methods were formulated on the 15th, ordering the Hubei Provincial Government to comply. The methods are as follows: 1) In terms of geographical relations, the county should be under the jurisdiction of the Administrative Inspector of the Fourth District of Hubei. 2) Before the county seal is transferred by the Ministry of the Interior for issuance, a wooden seal will be temporarily issued by the headquarters to show faith. The county magistrate will come to the headquarters to receive it and report the date of its use for future reference. 3) In addition to the establishment fee and the initial investigation fee of 3,000 yuan, the first month's expenses and subsidies totaling 2,250 yuan, totaling 5,250 yuan, should be drawn by the county magistrate from the headquarters' finance department. In the future, monthly expenses and subsidies totaling 2,250 yuan should be budgeted by the county magistrate and directly submitted to the provincial government for issuance. 4) The headquarters should send a committee member to delineate the county boundary, and the county magistrate should also serve as the committee member. However, the boundary between the county and Jingfu County is slightly different. The county boundary should be used as the standard, and the county magistrate of Jingfu County and the surveying committee members should carefully delineate and report for investigation. 5) After the county magistrate takes office, all organizational steps and construction matters should be explained in detail in a list and submitted to the headquarters and the relevant provincial and district officials for verification. 6) All other matters shall be handled in accordance with the new establishment guidelines for newly established counties in the recovered area promulgated by the headquarters.

<h3 id="e73">The United States After the Election <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The United States of North America, hailed as the world's financial king, dominating the world with its gold standard policy, possesses a quarter of the world's cash, yet this is insufficient to remedy its practical difficulties and overcome the current panic. President Hoover, in his campaign speeches, claimed that the panic had reached its lowest point and would gradually improve. He also asserted that the economic decline in the United States was not the fault of the U.S. itself, but rather the influence of the world economy.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, most Americans believed his claims. However, anyone who has been to the United States and observed the general situation knows that ordinary Americans have a very faint interest in politics. They have no particularly strong support for or opposition to either Hoover or Roosevelt. However, they are indeed tired of the Republican Party's rule and want a change. Moreover, Hoover's tricks to stimulate market prosperity have not been successful, failing to maintain public support. Therefore, the Republican presidential candidate could not but lose the election.</p>
<p>Roosevelt will be the master of the White House after March next year, and various government offices will have a new set of people. The Democratic Party, based on farmers and energized by the Ku Klux Klan, is resuming power. What will become of this, it is still difficult to say. Although the current president cannot fully insist on the policies he advocates, he is very careful about the aftermath, especially preserving the interests of bankers, leaving a good impression and paving the way for the Republican Party's future. Although President Hoover is promoting everywhere, saying that the "economic panic" has gradually passed and a good market is coming soon, he is still vigilant. For example, the wealthy state of New York is requesting assistance for the poor every day. Not only is the effect minimal, but even the state government's salaries cannot be paid. The federal government plans to levy a sales tax on all goods (except food), but it is feared that merely increasing taxes will not be enough to balance the budget. Therefore, a further reduction in federal officials' salaries is necessary, reportedly cutting salaries by 11%. The image of a land of gold, which we imagined before visiting America, contrasts sharply with the hardship faced by its ordinary people today. Though better than that of our homeland across the ocean, and despite higher material enjoyment, the sudden shift from salary reduction to unemployment is a scene of great panic.</p>
<p>The end of June this year marks the end of the fiscal year. A comprehensive calculation of the loans borrowed due to the panic over the past year totals a staggering 3.3 billion U.S. dollars, including 615.6 million U.S. dollars in Treasury notes and 272.5 million U.S. dollars in Treasury bills. Securities maturing in September this year amount to 712 million U.S. dollars. Because there are various conditions in the market that provide for use (such as excessive idle funds and no place to invest), the government's issuance of public bonds is very convenient. Therefore, in addition to issuing 400 million U.S. dollars in securities with an interest rate of 1.25%, it also issued 750 million U.S. dollars in five-year notes with an interest rate of 3.25%. The number of applications within a short period of time exceeded seven times. The amount of short-term loans that have matured recently is as follows:</p>
<p>Maturity Date Type Amount Interest Rate</p>
<p>(Thousands of USD)</p>
<p>October 15, 1932 Securities 33,300 3.25% (Thousands of USD)</p>
<p>December 5, 1932 Notes 600,300 3.25% (Thousands of USD)</p>
<p>March 15, 1933 Securities 660,700 3.75%</p>
<p>It is easy to convert these short-term loans into long-term or medium-term loans, as long as the interest rate is not below 3%. Although public debt increases year by year and raising public debt is easy, the decrease in tax revenue indicates industrial decline. Even if public debt can be increased, it is not a good sign.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party's policy toward the Orient, especially for us Chinese living in foreign countries, deserves particular attention. Within the Democratic Party, there are indeed some who advocate peace, concessions to Japan, revising immigration laws, and abolishing differential treatment towards Japan. They advocate returning the Atlantic Fleet to its original formation, but still insist on "Open Door" policy and will not give up the Eastern market. On the issue of Philippine independence, there are also two different views within the Democratic Party. One faction believes that the Cutting proposal, which allows the Philippines to be independent after eight years, is too long. They believe that the island should be allowed independence within the next 40 months. First, it conforms to the Democratic Party's consistent advocacy, and second, it takes the opportunity to gain Britain's favor and break up the alliance between Britain and Japan. On the surface, the desire to keep overseas territories under the American flag and not allow them free independence runs counter to the principles and ideals that the United States has always held. Therefore, allowing the Philippines to be independent is inevitable. On the other hand, some believe that the U.S. Congress does not have the power to allow the Philippine Islands to be independent, because the Federal Constitution does not grant such power to Congress. Therefore, the power to allow the Philippines to be independent lies with all the people of the United States. Unless the Constitution is amended first, Congress has no right to pass this case. Furthermore, the faction advocating Philippine independence does not advocate giving up the special right to station troops in the Philippines. Although most Americans are tired of war, they are unwilling to relax their hold on commercial and investment interests.</p>
<p>Take the issue of European war debts as an example. In terms of financial losses and the credit of the financial capitalists in their own party, they cannot but strongly demand repayment. However, in terms of commercial interests and the sales of industrial products to Europe, if funds are forcibly repatriated, the European market will become more depressed, and the U.S. economic panic will be even more difficult to recover. Even U.S. bankers, who are hailed as experts in capital management, cannot help but seek short-term gains and will probably insist on collecting debts. Whether they can collect the more than 270 million U.S. dollars in European war debts that are due on December 15 is of course a problem. They do not care about the future and just want to do their best to collect debts now. From the perspective of Washington, they generally believe that they can be collected.

<p>The entire line from Qinzhou, Guangdong, through Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan to Chongqing is 1,850 miles long, divided into five sections for construction, estimated to be completed in six years. Guangzhou Communication: The Southwest Political Affairs Committee recently resolved to develop southwestern transportation and prepare for the construction of the Qinyu Railway in the five provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. It also telegraphed each provincial government to send one representative to Guangzhou to organize a road construction committee. Guangxi Province recently appointed Wang Xunzhi as a preparatory committee member, and Guangdong Province recently appointed Chen Guoquan as a preparatory committee member. As for Guizhou Province, a representative was sent to Guangzhou by Wang Jialie to negotiate. However, due to the sudden change in the political situation in Guizhou and the ongoing stalemate in the Sichuan war, Sichuan and Guizhou have not yet sent out preparatory members. As for the road construction plan, Li Xiangen, Li Xisheng, Zhang Renmin, Mai Huanzhang, and others have recently been appointed to be responsible for review. The plan is as follows:</p>

The main points of the port city development are as follows: (1) Huangpu Port City refers to both Huangpu Port and Huangpu City. Huangpu Port is the commercial area of Huangpu Port, and Huangpu City is the urban area of Huangpu Port. They are unified in governance. An administrative agency will be established in the urban area, directly under the Guangdong Provincial Government. The port is designated as a tax port, so that customs duties can be used for administrative expenses and to protect the province's nascent industries. (2) Huangpu has a deep-water bay that can accommodate ocean-going ships and is decided to be developed as a first-class commercial port. (3) The commercial port is located in the Yuzhu Market area, so as to connect with the Guangzhou shipping line.

(6) The locations of each area are planned as follows: The administrative area is selected south of the Shanan Village, which is the central point. The industrial area is planned to be located west of Wakugang, north of the Yuzhu Market and Lian Shi Creek Village, and between Shigan Huanxi Village, to facilitate land and water transportation. The drop-off area is planned to be south of Leifeng Mountain, Xixi, Wenchong, Wenyuan, and Shuanggua, located south of the future Guangshan Railway. Type A residential areas are scattered around Feilongling, Baiqiling, Zhuangyuan Mountain, Shetanggang, Niushan, Shuanggua, Houdishan, and Luogang.

Now, the righteous army has risen up to resist Japan, fighting fiercely with bare hands. Even women and children are tearfully supporting them. Those who lost territory and humiliated the country are guilty for generations, while those who are loyal and brave in saving the country will be praised for eternity. The support of the people is clearly evident. You are stationed in western Liaoning and governing Rehe, and you have always been known for your loyalty and bravery in defending the country and the nation. The whole country has been relying on you for a long time. Recently, we have heard that the violent Japanese will launch a large-scale invasion of Rehe, advancing an inch and wanting a foot, and will not stop. If we do not resist, not only will Rehe be lost, but Yuguan will be difficult to defend, and the important areas of Peiping and Tianjin will also be impossible to hold. The great China will be destroyed one by one from now on. You are the first to face the enemy, and the crisis is imminent. Everything depends on you. We hope that you will perish with the land and fight to the death against the enemy. Even one soldier must resist to the end, bring glory to the nation, and fight for the country. This is what our people rely on, and it is also your future. Compatriots across the country are planning to follow up. At this time of national crisis, we can only mobilize all the people and the anti-Japanese armed forces to fight together to the death. As fellow countrymen, we believe that you will be deeply sympathetic. We respectfully express our sincerity and extend our respects to the anti-Japanese struggle. Shanghai United Association of National Salvation Organizations, Standing Directors, Shen Zuxu, Chen Peide, Chen Yafu, Zhang Tianbai, Zhang Yi, Wang Hanliang, etc., respectfully salute."</p>

<p>The Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association yesterday sent a letter to Chen Chiping of the Fujian Daily, reporting on the situation of assisting the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. The letter stated: "At the beginning of the establishment of our association, we originally regarded the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in Beiping as the hub of the Northeast Righteous Army, and entrusted it to forward the funds for assistance to avoid accidents. Later, representatives of various armies coming from the south requested to find ways to provide direct assistance, but the amount raised in the past six months was only more than 300,000 yuan. We know that a cup of water cannot save a burning cart of firewood, and we can only do our best to cope with it. All the funds that have been allocated are: 20,000 yuan for Ma Zhanshan in Heilongjiang, and 10,000 yuan each for Su Bingwen twice. The first payment has arrived, and the second remittance was recovered due to the withdrawal of troops. Regarding Jilin, 18,000 yuan for the joint army of Ding Chao and Li Du, 17,000 yuan for Feng Zhanhai's troops, 10,000 yuan for Wang Delin's troops, 5,000 yuan for Tian Lin's troops, and 5,000 yuan for Fu Dianchen's troops. For the various departments in the border areas of Liaoning and Rehe, 30,000 yuan was entrusted to General Zhu Qinglan for forwarding. 30,000 yuan for Zhu Ziqing's division of the Northeast National Salvation Army, 17,000 yuan for Tang Juwu's troops, and 10,000 yuan for Li Junran and Sun Guanying's troops. The remaining payments to General Zhu Qinglan include 5,000 yuan for the purchase of military radios, 15,000 yuan for donors to specify for transfer, and 13,000 yuan for special expenses. There are currently more than 100,000 yuan in donations, which will be used to purchase a large number of bullets and distribute them to the front line. In addition, cotton clothes, tents, and military blankets and other military supplies have been allocated to the various departments of Geng Jizhou, Zhu Jiqing, He Minhun, and Dong Rongji, totaling no less than 5,000 pieces. Our association has done its best to provide assistance to all the actual anti-Japanese departments in the three provinces, using the most appropriate method to make it practical. The responsible representatives of the various armies have also been able to effectively contact each other and consult at any time."</p>

<p>Hoping to Get Through the Severe Winter and Resist for a Long Time, We Hope That All Sectors Will Actively Transport Supplies</p>
<p>The Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association received a letter from Liang Detang, the plenipotentiary representative of Wang Delin, commander-in-chief of the National Salvation Army, from Peiping, which stated: "Dear Sirs, I have received your letter and 5,000 yuan from the Bank of China to support Commander-in-Chief Wang Delin's troops. I have received the full amount and will immediately find a way to remit it. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the entire army. Enclosed are two copies of our commander-in-chief's telegrams, please check them. Please continue to maintain the source of assistance, and your merits will be immeasurable. Recently, Ma Su has failed, and people from Harbin have reported that our army is fighting hard, lacking ammunition, and facing great difficulties. We must rush to manufacture day and night at the Dongning Arsenal. Financial constraints make it difficult to purchase from Russia. With 70,000 troops, we hope to get through the severe winter so that we can resist for a long time. I have briefly described the situation, and I hope you will understand and provide assistance." It is heard that the Righteous Army Support Association currently has less than 100,000 yuan in donations, and it has been designated to purchase bullets, so in addition to the 15,000 yuan that has been allocated to Wang's troops, there are currently no funds available for allocation. The association hopes that all sectors will actively transport supplies to help Wang Delin's troops.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Fuhai Steamer Gunfire Incident <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Fisheries Bureau Misunderstood Fuhai, Fuhai Misunderstood the Navy, and the Fisheries Bureau Also Misunderstood the Navy. This Case Is Under Negotiation.</p>
<p>The Fuhai patrol ship of the Marine Fisheries Administration of the Jiangzhe District of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had a misunderstanding with the Navy the day before yesterday and opened fire. Yesterday, the Navy soldiers had already withdrawn, and the shipyard had sent a letter to the bureau for negotiation. We will now record the details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Navy Withdraws <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Since the Fuhai patrol ship opened fire on the Navy the day before yesterday, the Jiangnan and Jiangkang small steamboats of the Navy have approached the Datong Pier. In order to determine the responsibility for right and wrong and to avoid the expansion of the situation and causing unexpected disputes, the Navy authorities ordered all the guards on the two small steamboats to withdraw on the night of the day before yesterday. Weisheng also stopped its operations, so the situation yesterday was more relaxed.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Cause of the Conflict <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The cause of the conflict the day before yesterday was entirely a misunderstanding and was very complicated. The Fisheries Bureau has a total of four patrol ships: Qing'an, Haiying, Biaohai, and Fuhai, which are all protecting fisheries in the outer seas. The Fuhai ship was also in Dinghai a month ago, protecting fishing boats. The bureau recently responded to the request of the Yongfeng Frozen Seafood Company in this city and agreed to dispatch the Fuhai ship to protect the company's frozen seafood on the sea surface, so it immediately ordered the ship to sail to Shanghai. However, at that time, the ship was protecting fisheries between Shengshan and Dinghai and could not return immediately. Later, Zhou Bingkui, the acting director of the bureau, personally went to Dinghai to meet the ship's captain, Guo Wei, and ordered him to sail to Shanghai immediately. After discussing the supply of food and pay for the ship, Zhou left for Shanghai first.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Delay in Arriving in Shanghai <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>After Zhou left Dinghai, the Fuhai ship continued to engage in fishing protection work there (the ship's merchants have a treaty stipulating that it cannot protect other fishing vessels before the protection period expires). When Fuhai planned to return, a "Da Dui" fishing merchant reported that fishing boats off Shenjiaxing had been robbed and requested the ship to suppress the bandits. The captain of the ship felt that it was difficult not to deal with it, so he sailed the ship to Shenjiamen to suppress the bandits and informed the Shanghai bureau. In the middle, due to the time spent suppressing the bandits, there was some delay, and it was not until the 14th of this month that it arrived in Shanghai and dropped anchor in the Jiangqiao Pudong area of the South City.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Fisheries Bureau is Furious <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Fisheries Bureau was furious because the ship had repeatedly been ordered to sail to Shanghai but was still slow to act, delaying the time, which caused the bureau's previous promise to the Yongfeng Frozen Seafood Company to send a ship for protection to be delayed. The company had already requested another ship for protection, so it was very angry about the ship's delayed actions and disregard for the bureau's orders.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Misunderstanding Arises <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, it was rumored that the bureau would ask the Navy to pursue the ship and disarm it because it had disregarded the bureau's orders. Therefore, the ship could not help but feel uneasy after arriving in Shanghai. It happened that the Navy sent personnel with guards to the ship the day before yesterday to negotiate outstanding payments, which made the ship even more convinced that they were coming to disarm it, so it was very frightened. Thus, a misunderstanding arose, and gunfire was opened, almost leading to a major incident.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Report to the Bureau <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>When the conflict between the ship and the Navy occurred the day before yesterday, Wang Zhiliang, the director of the Fisheries Bureau's Dinghai office (currently in Shanghai), learned of it. Because he did not understand the truth, he went to the bureau to meet with Acting Director Zhou and reported that two gray ships full of soldiers had come to the Fuhai ship to disarm it. He asked if it was dispatched by the director. Zhou was very surprised at the time because he had not issued such an order. He asked if there was an official document, and if there was no official document, they should resist.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Serious Negotiations <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>When Director Wang reported to Acting Director Zhou, it was after the Fuhai ship had fired a shot. The Navy felt that the ship's actions were strange and unusual, and it was inconvenient to board the ship again to avoid further incidents. At that time, it immediately retreated to another location and withdrew on order that night, and the serious situation stopped immediately. Yesterday, the Navy authorities stated that the ship belonged to the Fisheries Bureau and that the outstanding payments had been repeatedly demanded from the bureau without any response. It was unreasonable to send personnel to the ship to negotiate and open fire without asking the reason. Therefore, although yesterday was Sunday, Deputy Director Chen Zaofan still went to the office to work and ordered the secretary of the shipyard to send a letter to the bureau for serious negotiations. If there was still no effect, effective measures would be taken. The letter was issued yesterday in the name of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Fisheries Bureau's Statement <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>According to the Fisheries Bureau's statement to the China News Agency, the outstanding payments had long been submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for transfer to the Ministry of Finance, but they had not been received to date. The bureau's funding was extremely difficult, so the shipyard's current funds could not be raised. Even the salaries of the bureau's current employees were borrowed from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce by several thousand yuan to be paid, so the bureau was unable to repay the debt. In the bureau's current situation, it was truly helpless. In addition to the Jiangnan Shipyard, the Haiying patrol ship of the bureau had also been unable to pay the repair fees to the Qiu Xin Factory years ago.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Shanghai-Tianjin Route Will Open <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to Return Three Times a Week Starting on New Year's Day Next Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Tianjin aviation route, which has been planned for a long time, has been delayed until now due to the Qingdao airport issue. Now that all the procedures have been completed, it has been decided to officially fly starting on New Year's Day next year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Qingdao Airport Resolves The Shanghai-Tianjin air route is sponsored by the China National Aviation Corporation. Since its preparation, it has been eight months. The various airports along the route, such as Haizhou and Tianjin, have long been built. However, the land for the Qingdao station was leased by the Japanese, so the Ministry of Communications sent personnel to Qingdao several times to negotiate the recovery, but without success. It was not until Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie negotiated the recovery of about 400 mu of land, paying the Japanese 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Official Launch After Zhu Jia驊 took over as chairman of the company, he transferred Dai Enji to succeed him as general manager. After taking office, Dai actively developed the business by reorganizing the internal affairs. He paid special attention to the Shanghai-Tianjin line, and planned to open it as soon as possible to facilitate transportation. Therefore, since the Qingdao airport was resolved, he supervised his subordinates to go to Qingdao to handle the installation of radios, etc., and restored the airports along the line. The original aviation station built at Tianjin Airport had already been destroyed, and it was originally planned to be rebuilt. However, in order to save expenses, it was decided to rent houses nearby for passengers to rest and for staff to work, which was more convenient in terms of procedures and allowed for earlier preparation. The route is expected to be officially launched on New Year's Day next year for passenger and mail transportation.</p>
<p>Full Route Distance The total distance of the route is slightly less than 700 miles, with four stations: Shanghai, Haizhou, Qingdao, and Tianjin. From Shanghai to Haizhou is 270 miles, Haizhou to Qingdao is 150 miles, and Qingdao to Tianjin is 270 miles. In the future, the number of flights along the line will be temporarily three round trips per week, and then increased depending on the flight performance.</p>
<p>Ticket Prices After the full route is opened, the departure times and prices are still under consideration. However, according to the investigation by the China News Agency, the approximate prices are 80 yuan from Shanghai to Haizhou, 120 yuan to Qingdao, and 220 yuan to Dalian. Haizhou to Qingdao is 40 yuan, Qingdao to Tianjin is 100 yuan, and Haizhou to Tianjin is 120 yuan.</p>
<p>Flight Times (Northbound Flight) Shanghai departs at 7:45 am, arrives at Haizhou at 10:45 am, Haizhou departs at 10:55 am, arrives at Qingdao at 12:15 pm, Qingdao departs at 12:30 pm, and arrives at Tianjin at 3:30 pm. (Southbound Flight) Tianjin departs at 8:00 am, arrives at Qingdao at 11:00 am, Qingdao departs at 11:15 am, arrives at Haizhou at 12:35 pm, Haizhou departs at 12:45 pm, and arrives at Shanghai at 3:45 pm. (The above times and fares are said to be subject to change.)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Office of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Rescue Team received a telegram from the second team at the front yesterday, stating that the team had arrived at the Liushouying on the Beining Road and was under the command of Zheng Gui'an's Fifth Route Army, and had begun rescue work. Liushouying is about 300 li away from Beiping. The captain of the team, Fei Jian, will leave Shanghai for the north this morning to inspect the rescue work of the first and second teams, and it is learned that the third batch of team members will also be formed and go north this month.</p>

<p>After Liu Zhenbang, Zhan Guoshu, and Zhou Juemin, representatives of Dong Rongji's Northeast Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, arrived in Shanghai, they contacted various organizations for assistance for days. It is learned that they have received 1,604 pieces of cotton clothing and blankets from the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association and 300 pieces of cotton clothing from the Jin Hui Guild Hall, and have sent people to transport them out of the pass first. The representatives plan to go to Guangdong to beg for assistance in the near future.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reported that many Chinese merchants in this city, led by Du Yuesheng, have signed a contract with Soviet Russia to sell a large amount of timber, the total amount of which is said to be no less than 90 million feet, which can be said to be the first major timber transaction with Soviet Russia. The first batch of 6 million feet has already arrived in Shanghai, and the rest will be shipped one after another, roughly according to the consignment sales method. According to business circles, merchants in this city are now ordering a large number of goods from the Soviet Russian Commercial Agency in Shanghai to make up for the losses from boycotting Japanese goods. It is heard that the Russians are currently planning to open a regular shipping line between Shanghai and Vladivostok to facilitate the transportation of goods.</p>
<h3 id="e115">The Story of the Two Railway Lines' Employees Requesting Wartime Bonuses <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The case of employees from the Japanese-controlled Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai), Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo) railway lines requesting the issuance of loss relief loans to employees serving in war zones failed to gain approval from the Ministry of Railways, leading to gatherings and detentions of trains, which has already been reported in the newspapers. Reporters stationed in Nanjing, considering that the nation is currently facing severe difficulties, and the sudden occurrence of such incidents is extremely unfortunate, and the details of this incident will certainly be of concern to people in society, inquired with the Ministry of Railways for detailed records of the matter's initiation and handling. After investigating, this case originated after the January 28th Incident this year. All employees of the Jinghu and Huhangyong railway lines, angered by the violent Japanese occupation of Shanghai, risked their lives to perform their duties. The Minister of Railways, concerned about the employees in the war zone, sent personnel to express condolences and instructed the railway bureaus to specially commend and console those employees of the two lines who had served bravely and loyally, provide generous compensation to the injured and deceased, and award 30,000 yuan to those who preserved railway property and protected vehicles. When the ceasefire agreement was established at the end of May, the employees of the two railway lines immediately restored traffic after recovering Nanxiang, Zhenru, and North Station, achieving remarkable results, and were once again commended. During this time of national crisis, the employees risked their lives to work and fulfilled their duties, and the Ministry of Railways did its best to provide generous compensation and encouragement. Around July, the workers of the Wusong Machine Factory, feeling they had suffered losses being located in a war zone, first proposed a plan to borrow three months' salary, which was submitted to the bureau and then to the ministry. The two railway bureau chiefs, citing the precedent of the Qi-Lu War, requested the Ministry of Railways to approve the issuance of two months' bonus to the employees. The railway union also sent representatives to the ministry twice to petition. Minister of Railways Gu, considering the importance of the matter, specifically proposed it for discussion at the ministry's business meeting on October 4th. All senior officials of the ministry attended the meeting and generally believed that the January 28th Incident was a war of national resistance. All public officials in Shanghai bravely sacrificed and fulfilled their duties. Many civilians in the war zone were bankrupted, and even people near the war zone donated their homes to support the military. Therefore, the losses from this battle were widespread. Public officials in other institutions in Shanghai were not known to have received any so-called bonuses. At this time of internal and external difficulties, when the entire nation is striving to improve and be determined, if the issuance of wartime bonuses to the employees of the two railway lines is approved, it will inevitably cause misunderstandings in the outside world about the heroic sacrifices of our employees for the country. Furthermore, the finances of the two railway lines have been very strained in recent years. As of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the Sino-British surplus profits have not been cleared for many years. The repayment of loans has been postponed for two years, and the loans for purchasing cars and land cannot be cleared. Although the bondholders have complained, there is no way to raise the funds. The total amount of due but unpaid funds has reached more than 7 million yuan. Since the Japanese invasion, reconstruction requires money everywhere. Issuing bonuses is not only legally impermissible, but also difficult due to economic constraints. However, considering that the employees' requests were sincere and the losses were real, after careful consideration, while the request for bonuses could not be approved, the suffering of the employees was taken into account, and a compromise was decided upon. "Measures for Loss Relief Loans to Employees Serving in the War Zone of the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Lines" were decided. The regulations stipulated that employees of the two railway lines serving within the war zone whose salaries were below 50 yuan were allowed to borrow two months' salary, those with salaries from 51 yuan to 100 yuan were allowed to borrow one and a half months' salary, and those with salaries from 101 yuan to 200 yuan were allowed to borrow one month's salary. In the future, one-tenth of their original salary would be deducted monthly. If the funds of the railway lines were insufficient, they were allowed to borrow from banks to issue the loans. The administrative bureaus of the two railway lines and the councils of the two railway line unions and employees were ordered to comply. This measure can be said to be the Ministry of Railways' attempt to provide relief in a situation where there was no other way, and it has taken great care to relieve the difficulties of lower-level employees in the war zones of the two railway lines. In addition to the above-mentioned measures for relief loans to employees serving in the war zone, the administrative bureaus of the two railway lines failed to immediately implement them, resulting in senior officials and employees from non-war zones following suit and requesting loans for all employees for two months. The administrative bureaus of the two railway lines also successively sent telegrams on behalf of the employees. The Ministry of Railways considered that the above-mentioned measures were originally intended to meet the urgent needs of lower-level employees in the war zone who had suffered losses in the Shanghai war. During the war, the salaries of the employees of the two railway lines were paid as usual, which was already a special privilege compared to other institutions. Senior officials have relatively sufficient means of support and can easily find ways to manage their finances. Furthermore, since not all areas along the two railway lines are war zones, the situation is different, so it is not appropriate to approve loans across the board. Regardless, the employees of the two railway lines who died in service have been given generous compensation, and those who contributed to protecting trains have been given special awards. From the perspective of civil servants, should they not all possess the spirit of loyalty, courage, and diligence, and the inherent duty of conscientiously performing their duties? If all employees of the two railway lines, regardless of whether they are in war zones or non-war zones, whether they have suffered losses or not, request loans, it would not only provide outsiders with grounds for criticism, but also make it impossible to justify oneself to the affected employees. Therefore, although the Ministry of Railways has the heart to care for all employees, it cannot but comprehensively plan, weigh the importance of things, and avoid further burdening the railway lines with debt. However, the employees of the two railway lines do not seem to understand this, and the administrative bureaus of the two railway lines do not seem to be able to sincerely persuade the employees, resulting in the unfortunate incident of gatherings and detentions of trains that occurred a few days ago. According to sources from the Ministry of Railways, the decision is to maintain the original plan and send personnel to sincerely explain the situation. Now, the majority of employees have understood the original intention of the Ministry of Railways in approving the loan. The Ministry of Railways is also trying to make all employees of the two railway lines fully understand the Ministry's intention to maintain the railway administration and care for the employees. The Japanese invasion is a national crisis and a great shame and humiliation that has pained our nation. The entire nation is working hard to improve and be determined, tightening their belts to wipe out the humiliation. Railway employees, being loyal and devoted to the country, should be able to overcome the difficulties of the times (uphold the overall situation and maintain the railway administration), etc.</p>

<p>The Minnan (Southern Fujian) Association in Shanghai held a standing committee meeting on the 17th and resolved to send a telegram to Chairman Lin, Zhang Gan, Ding Chaowu, Zeng Zhongming, and Dai Kuisheng, proposing that they submit a plan for the reform of Fujian province to the Third Plenary Session. The telegram reads as follows: Respectfully sent to Nanjing to Lin Zichao, Ding Lifu, Zhang Gan, Dai Kuisheng, Zeng Zhongming, and all committee members. Our Fujian has suffered from bandits and disasters for years, villages and towns have been reduced to ruins, taxes and levies are heavy, and the people's lives are hanging by a thread. Now, as the Third Plenary Session is being held in Nanjing, it gives our people a glimmer of hope. We especially appeal to you to draft a concrete plan regarding the major issues of banditry, excessive taxes and levies, national defense equipment, local autonomy, transportation, education, and industry in Fujian province, submit it to the conference for resolution, and consult the government for prompt implementation, in order to alleviate the people's suffering and strengthen the foundation of the country. We cannot express our eager waiting. The Minnan Association in Shanghai kowtows.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Measures for Exchanging Silk Public Bonds <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The 3 million yuan of Jiangzhe Silk Public Bonds has already begun to be issued. The two committees for the sorting and promotion of old silk and cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have jointly established a joint office located inside the Silk and Cocoon General Association on Beishan West Road, which was declared established on the 16th. It is determined that the silk public bonds will be subject to the first lottery for repayment of principal at the end of this month. Therefore, manufacturers holding export certificates issued by the Jianghai Customs and measurement certificates from the Raw Silk Inspection Institute should apply to the office for public bond certificates. Those that have already been sold but not yet loaded on the wheel and old factory silk currently stored in foreign firms should also request the foreign firms to load and export them before the 25th and send them to the inspection institute for examination so as to exchange export certificates and measurement certificates for public bond certificates and avoid losing the right to the first lottery for repayment of principal. Therefore, the market mistakenly believed that foreign firms had a large number of factory transactions. In fact, the silk stored in the foreign firms' warehouses was being sent for inspection and measurement in order to be loaded and exported. The chairman of the sorting committee, Zhu Jing'an, the chief of general affairs, Shen Huachen, and the chairman of the promotion committee, He Bingxian, are stationed in the office every day to work, and they are quite busy. Silk merchants applying for public bond certificates must first submit the export certificates and measurement certificates to He Bingxian, chairman of the promotion committee, for verification, and then send them upstairs to Zhu Jing'an, chairman of the sorting committee, and Chief Shen for signature and sealing, and then issue the public bond certificates, which can be used to exchange for public bond tickets from the fund management committee.</p>

<p>The General Association of the Great Alliance for the Abolition of Civil War sent letters to chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities across the country yesterday, stating: "The abolition of civil war is the minimum condition for resisting foreign aggression and saving the country. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary for the people of various places to work together. Since the formal establishment of this association on August 27, it has begun to prepare for the establishment of branches and recruit members. Currently, branches have been established in Tianjin, Beiping, and Sichuan. Branches are being planned in Hankou, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changsha, and other places. However, the organization of branches, in accordance with the regulations, should be handled by local legal organizations, and the procedures cannot be completed in a short time. In particular, it is necessary to be careful in the process, so that the establishment of branches is powerful and free from malpractices. Before the branches can be formally established, there is an urgent need for a corresponding organization in each province and city to communicate and facilitate progress. After deliberation by the Third Standing Committee of this association, before the establishment of branches in each province and city, the local chambers of commerce should first recommend a number of members from their committees and members to form members of the Anti-Civil War Committee, in order to increase strength," etc. Therefore, a special record is attached to inform you and hope you will follow it. Please also indicate the date of establishment of the Anti-Civil War Committee and the list of committee members at any time.</p>

<p>Holiday Schedules Vary Among Foreign Institutions</p>
<p>This year, Christmas and New Year's Day both fall on Sundays, so the holidays of foreign institutions stationed in Shanghai vary slightly.

<p>Regarding the continued addition of two yuan to the land price tax, Director Jiang of the Shanghai Public Property Office and others send a telegram on behalf of the people to Gu, Chairman of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, Song, Minister of Finance, and Shu, Director of the Department of Finance, stating: "In the second term land price tax announcement issued by the finance bureau, the levy of two yuan is still to be added. This is shocking. The electric message Fu Zi No. 12, presented in December of last year, stated that this case had been presented several times by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. It can still be handled as long as it is during the bandit suppression period. During this extension period of one year, each county must not add any surcharges under the item of field tax. After the expiration of the period, the provincial government must not ask for an extension again under any name. [The treasury and the people both struggle], the reply was forwarded. Subsequently, the national government approved the record, and the ministry ordered the Jiangsu Department of Finance to comply, all on file. Upon receiving this, we learned that the grain price increase has already been borne by the people for two years. The government has repeatedly declared that there will be no continuation. Therefore, we painfully paid. Unexpectedly, this year it continues to be added, in violation of the previous order. What is the meaning of national credibility? The director is under the supervision of local elders and dare not remain silent. Therefore, we telegraphically request your ministry to quickly order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the Department of Finance to cancel the continued addition of two yuan of grain tax, in order to clean up the political system and relieve the people's suffering. Jiang Shijie, director of the Shanghai County Public Property Management Office, and Kang Yongping, deputy director, kowtow."</p>

Responsible personnel were assigned to each group for screening. However, the venue was unfortunately hit by a fire that day. Fortunately, the rescue was swift, and only a portion of the exhibits were damaged by water stains. Therefore, the examination was delayed for a long time. It is now learned that the examination committee has largely completed the examination and is currently preparing the certificates of merit and manufacturing the medals, which will definitely be issued within the year.</p>

<p>Equipment Construction Will Be Completed Soon; Opening on New Year's Day</p>
<p>The Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road in this city, which began construction in August of this year, has now completed the second phase of equipment construction and is scheduled to open on New Year's Day. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e125">Construction Progress <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The first phase of the park's construction project was put out to tender by the Municipal Bureau of Education in August of this year and was won by Sansen Construction Company for 13,400 yuan. Since construction began, it was completed last month, and the second phase of equipment construction, including the installation of water heaters, water pipes, electric lights, and the construction of revetments, the stacking of artificial mountains, the laying of grass, and the planting of trees, has largely been completed. It will be completed within this year, and it will be opened on New Year's Day.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Arrangements <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The park has one main gate and one side gate, facing the Municipal Education Center. It is surrounded by short walls. The office is in the center of the park. Around it is a stone-built ditch two zhang deep, for raising waterfowl. Next to it is an artificial mountain with a pavilion on top for visitors to rest. Below it is a goldfish pond and a rabbit hole. There are four animal rooms, large and small. The large ones have an area of 14 square zhang. The roof and front are all iron fences. The inner rooms are divided into two parts, currently housing a pair of newly arrived lions and a pair of black bears.

<p>Zhou Xiangkui, acting director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Marine Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Industry, received an order from the ministry to consolidate the temporary offices in various locations in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang area in order to facilitate management and rectification. After investigation, the offices in Wenningxiangnan and other places in Zhejiang were all abolished and merged into the Taizhou district office, which will manage the patrol boats under its jurisdiction. Cai Gengnan, director of the Taizhou district, will take over the command. The Zhenhai district will belong to the Dinghai district, and the patrol boats of each team will also be dispatched by the director. In Jiangsu, the offices in Songhu and Tongzhou, which were originally established, are also abolished at the same time and taken over by Zhu Songzhou, director of the Haizhou district office. Due to the rampant piracy on the coastal waters, there have been incidents of looting ships and kidnapping people, which has greatly harmed merchant ships. In order to effectively maintain maritime security, Captain Zhu quickly concentrated the fishing protection team ships to be ready for dispatch and patrol.</p>
<h3 id="e130">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Again Requests Correction of the Shipping Tax in this City <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Matters related to law and jurisdiction, violation of tax law, and should be ordered to stop immediately The Municipal Chamber of Commerce presented to the Executive Yuan and the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "It is submitted for presentation. On the 15th of this month, we received a letter from the barge transportation industry association in this city stating that the collection of ship registration tax by the Maritime Affairs Bureau in November of this year is actually a heavy collection agency similar to likin. We once again request that the Central Party Headquarters submit the report to the Third Plenary Session for lawful correction and cancellation of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, a redundant and heavily collected agency, which must not invade inland rivers to establish registration offices, which will increase the burden on lighterage merchants, delineate the functions and powers of the central and local maritime affairs agencies, and avoid obstacles to local maritime affairs agencies. The various exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous goods should be abolished and changed to a unified ship tax to unify and comply with the law," etc. Article 1 of the Ship Registration Law states, "The term 'ship' in this law refers to ships that navigate at sea and on waters that are connected to the sea and can be used by seagoing ships, as stipulated in the Maritime Law." According to this provision, in places that are not coastal or connected to the sea, there are no ships that can be used by seagoing ships. The Maritime Affairs Bureau has no place to exercise its powers in accordance with Article 2 of the Ship Registration Law, and it should not set up branches everywhere, causing chaos. This is a limitation of territorial jurisdiction. Even in coastal or connected places, for ships that can be used by seagoing ships but whose gross tonnage is less than 20 tons or whose capacity is less than 200 dan, this law does not apply. The same applies to ships whose main mode of operation is by eaves oars, which cannot be used by seagoing ships at all. In other words, they are not within the scope of registration with the Maritime Affairs Bureau. Now, the Maritime Affairs Bureau has set up branches everywhere in places that are not connected to the sea (such as Wuxi), and has forced farmers' ships and shipping ships to register and pay fees (such as Changshu), which is truly an excessive burden on merchants and violates laws and regulations. The Ministry of Transportation's reply has also failed to strictly correct the situation in accordance with the law. This matter is related to the interpretation of the law, the division of powers between the ministry and the city, and the crux of the matter is that the illegal burden on merchants is beyond their capacity to bear. Therefore, we respectfully request your court and government to examine and approve and order correction, which is in the public interest.</p>

<p>The Yingdou River originates in Jiangyin and flows into the Huangpu River. In the eastern part of the first district of Shanghai County and at the junction with the second district, it is one of the most important trunk rivers in the county, as recorded in the gazetteer. It has been more than 60 years since it was dredged during the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty. In recent years, the siltation has become increasingly severe. Not only is the tide blocked, but it has even turned into flat land. The first district office and the second district office convened a meeting and decided to dredge it. A preparatory committee has been established and is actively proceeding. Wu Shifang, the chief of the first district of Shanghai County, Peng Yinqiao, the chief of the second district, Jiang Zhujun, the director of the Public Property Office, and the heads of each Zou town related to the Yingdou River are ex officio committee members, and local people who are familiar with the river and enthusiastic about public welfare are also hoped to be river committee members. A standing committee of three members is established, and the director of the Public Property Office and the chiefs of the two districts are publicly recommended by the conference as standing committee members. Jiang Zhujun is mutually elected by the standing committee members as the chairman of the committee. The regulations have been drawn up and reported to the county government for record.</p>

<p>Representatives were appointed to go to Beijing to appeal. Yesterday evening, reporters were invited. Due to the Northern Salt Public Business Office harming merchants and people, the twenty-one counties in northern Anhui organized a committee to unanimously oppose it and appointed Lu Jianhou as a representative to come to Shanghai to request assistance from Anhui natives in Shanghai. Chang Fanhou, Liao Ziying, Hong Zhenjiu, Cao Zhigong, and others in Shanghai jointly discussed and established a support association to unanimously support it. Recently, with the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee convened, an emergency meeting was convened the day before yesterday, and it was decided to appoint Hong Zhenjiu and  Si, two committee members, together with Lu Jianhou, the representative from northern Anhui in Shanghai, to go to Beijing to appeal to the plenary session, striving to achieve the goal of abolishing this bad policy. They left for Beijing on the night train yesterday. The association also held a farewell banquet at the Atlantic Restaurant last night and invited reporters from various newspapers.

<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association has over nine hundred members. The regular membership dues of the association, as approved by the Ministry of Judicial Administration in the association's charter, stipulate that if a member owes membership dues for more than four months, the association can report the delinquent member for withdrawal from the association. Recently, the association found that there were as many as twenty-nine members who had owed regular membership dues for more than ten months. Therefore, it was brought up for discussion at the 125th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, and it was resolved to report these twenty-nine members to courts at all levels for withdrawal from the association. However, after being reported, these lawyers will not be able to appear in court. Therefore, for convenience, the association will leave the reporting documents unsealed at the association for three days and will notify each member who owes dues again, requiring them to pay the full amount of regular membership dues owed within these three days. If they fail to pay within the deadline, the documents will be sent out as required.</p>

<p>The bond amount is 15,000 yuan in national currency. Pan Gongzhan and others are members of the bond committee. The Lake Society on Guizhou Road in this city reported to the National Government last year and was approved to build a memorial hall for the martyr Chen Ying Shi in the society's premises. It has now been fully completed this summer. The construction funds were raised over several years, collecting huge sums. A portion of the donations were in the form of public bonds, which could not be used as cash. Loans were repeatedly borrowed from banks, but they were still insufficient. It is estimated that the project funds and the cost of purchasing internal equipment and appliances will still require about 10,000 taels of silver. The tenth executive committee meeting of the society resolved to issue bonds worth 15,000 yuan in national currency to meet urgent needs and organized a bond committee, appointing Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yiting, Chen Aishi, Qian Xinzhi, Shen Tianxin, and others as members responsible for handling the matter. It was also decided to start issuing them on New Year's Day next year.</p>

<p>Original Works of Song and Ming Dynasty Confucian Scholars on Display Today</p>
<p>The second day of the painting exhibition by Cantonese artist Chen Tianxiao saw an even larger crowd of visitors, many of whom praised Chen's divine brushwork. What is most commendable is that while ordinary painters require years of effort, Chen was able to complete this great undertaking in one fell swoop. Hundreds of works are impeccable. It is said that without patriotic enthusiasm, who could achieve this? Mr. Xu Shiying praised him on the spot for his broad-mindedness in helping others, and Mr. Ling Zhuoying praised him for his profound artistic skills. Mr. Wang Kecheng and Mr. Chen Dezhi also purchased multiple works. His friend Weng Ziguang was very pleased to see them and planned to exhibit original works by Chen Gulian of the Song Dynasty, Zhan Gan Quan of the Ming Dynasty, and Wang Yuanqi (one of the Four Wangs) and Shangguan Zhou of the early Qing Dynasty from his family collection at the venue today for the enjoyment of visitors.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Wu Mituo Sues for Inheritance <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code, there have been countless cases of women petitioning the court to inherit their father's estate. After the National Government announced that women's claims to inherit property would only be valid if their father's death occurred after the National Government's power reached the area, and after the Judicial Yuan issued a unified interpretation of the law abolishing the right of representation, the number of lawsuits over inheritance disputes has decreased significantly. Recently, the First Special Court accepted a case in which Wu Mituo, a local woman, sued her brother, Wu Changsheng, demanding payment of inheritance. The woman's father, Miao Fu, died in 1925. At that time, Jiangsu Province was still under the jurisdiction of Sun Chuanfang, and the power of the National Government had not yet reached the area. According to the law, she had no right to inherit. However, the woman claimed that she was her father's favorite and that she was 36 years old and had not yet married. A precedent set by the former Supreme Court in its third year, case number 669, stated that if a daughter was favored by her father, she could request a reasonable share of the inheritance. Therefore, Wu hired Feng Xizui and Wu Zhengzhao, two lawyers, to sue Wu Changsheng in the First Special Court, demanding a reasonable share of 100,000 yuan from her late father's estate of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Her lawsuit listed how her stepmother, Sheng, and the defendant had abused her, stating that the defendant sat on an estate of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, living in luxury, while the plaintiff had to work as a servant. The situations of the two parties were as different as heaven and earth. Yesterday, Judge Ding Dehan of the First Special Court opened the Fifth Civil Division for questioning. The defendant, Wu Changsheng, hired Zhang Zhengxue and Fang Jiahe, two lawyers, to defend him. According to Wu Mituo's testimony, after my father died, the defendant and others beat me and refused to let me in. Now I am working as a servant in the home of a certain family on Beijing Road. My father loved me very much when he was alive and was very strict in choosing a marriage partner for me, so I have not yet married. Now I am asking the defendant to give me a reasonable share of 100,000 yuan from the inheritance. When questioned, Wu Changsheng testified that the plaintiff did not abide by family rules when her father was alive and had an affair with Zhang Fulin from Shuanglin, cohabiting at Number 7, Minren Lane, Mintini Yin Road. The plaintiff ran away on her own in 1926, taking valuable jewelry with her. Furthermore, my late father's estate consists only of a few bungalows and a cemetery, with a total value of no more than 10,000 yuan. Moreover, all of them cannot be sold. What the plaintiff said is an exaggeration. If the court does not believe me, it can investigate. He also presented maternal uncles Zhang Xinting and Zhang Youting, uncles Wu Xinqing and Wu Xingen, and stepmother Wu Sheng as witnesses to prove that the plaintiff did indeed run away with the jewelry. The court briefly questioned each witness and then began the debate. After the two lawyers debated, the judge reserved the verdict for a scheduled pronouncement.</p>

<p>Clear Interrogation and Transfer for Trial</p>
<p>Recently, in various towns and villages such as Tangwan and Caohang in the second district of the county, major cases of robbery, kidnapping, and extortion have occurred one after another. After investigation by the county government, it was found that these cases were all committed by a group of local idle intellectuals. The Public Security Section was immediately ordered to supervise the detectives to arrest Peng Jieren, Chen Zhuxin, Chen Haiqing, Zhang Zhaoxiang, Sun Linsheng, and suspects Liu Junfu, Chen Haishan, and Wang A'tudi, a total of eight people, in the district and the British and French concessions. Twenty pistols were seized and sent to the section. After repeated trials by Section Chief Yao, the interrogation was clear, and he reported it to the county government for instructions. Now, under the order of County Magistrate Yan, Peng and the other eight criminals were transferred to the local court yesterday with a written record for trial.</p>

<p>Gun Bullets in Peanuts. The Municipal Public Security Bureau Detective Team recently received a tip that a batch of firearms was hidden in a dried goods shop at Number 305, Wangjia Wharf, Nanshi, and was planning to be secretly transported to other ports. The team dispatched personnel to the address on the previous day, accompanied by Mao Jiming, a police officer from the first precinct of the first district, to search the store carefully. After a long time, they found 1,200 rifle bullets hidden in a bag of peanuts. The store owner, Fu Bingfang, Zhu Zhike, and Shen Yuming, all from Shandong, along with the seized evidence, were taken to the first precinct of the first district. During the preliminary hearing by the police chief, Fu Bingfang and others confessed to intending to transport and sell the firearms to other ports. They were then taken back to the bureau for further investigation.</p>
<p>Reiterating the Prohibition of Pulling Bristles. Every time pig boats arrive at Youche Wharf in Nanshi, some people forcibly pull bristles from live pigs. This act has long been strictly prohibited by the authorities. However, recently, after a long time, the problem has resurfaced. Director Wen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, considering that these people are disregarding the ban and acting extremely unlawfully, specially notified the first precinct of the first district to instruct all relevant police officers to take note. In the future, if anyone is found forcibly pulling pig bristles, they should be taken to the bureau for strict punishment.</p>

The responsibilities that modern women should bear. Ms. Tu spoke from a legal standpoint, making very accurate points, which can serve as a mirror for new women in China.

<p>Northeast Refugee Relief Variety Show</p>
<h3 id="e142">Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Guests from all walks of life attended, totaling over 5,000 people. Chairman Yu Qiaqing personally delivered a speech. The variety show began at 5:00 PM. The variety show for Northeast refugee relief, sponsored by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Lawyers Association, and the Accountants Association, held its official opening ceremony at 3:00 PM yesterday after a month of preparation. For a time, the front of New World was packed with vehicles and people, making for a very lively scene. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement: A tall flower arch was built at the entrance of the venue by the Flower and Tree Industry Association, which was solemn, magnificent, and extremely beautiful. Inside and outside the venue, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Boy Scouts of various schools, and all the staff of the venue affairs department maintained order. Banners were hung on both sides of the entrance: "Sacrifice ourselves to fight for the survival of our nation" and "Use our iron and blood to defeat all tyranny." The walls throughout the venue were decorated with propaganda paintings made by the Academy of Fine Arts, which were shocking to the eye and could awaken people to the danger. (Detailed arrangements have been reported previously, so only a brief description is given here.) Huahua and Daxin Silk Shops and Daguangming and Shiji Photo Studios dispatched personnel to distribute preferential coupons on the spot.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Chairman Yu Qiaqing, Vice Chairman Shi Liangcai, and all directors and staff of the conference; Lu Jingshi of the Municipal Party Department; Zheng Chengqing of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Zhu Xuefan of the General Labor Union; Lin Kanghou of the Bankers Association; Xu Yongzuo and Pan Xulun of the Accountants Association; Tao Leqin of the Chinese Taxpayers Association; Hu Fengxiang of the Citizens' Union; Zhang Shichuan of Mingxing Film Company; Xu Jun of the Garrison Command; the Military Band of the Public Security Bureau; and representatives from various labor unions, trade associations, and schools, totaling over 5,000 people.</p>
<p>Conference Staff: Presidium: Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Shi Liangcai, Lin Kanghou; Recorder: Shao Xubai; Master of Ceremonies: Cao Zhigong; Reception: Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Li Mengnan, Li Yongxiang, Liu Xinquan, Liu Yiwen, Tang Daxin, Yang Jiaoqi.</p>
<p>Ceremony: At 3:00 PM, the opening ceremony was held in the Freedom Hall. First, the music team of the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School played music. Then, the presidium took their seats, sang the Party song, and the military band of the Public Security Bureau played the score. The Party and National Flags and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen were given the highest respect. Sun Yat-sen's will was read aloud. Then, Chairman Yu Qiaqing reported on the event, followed by Ren Jinping reporting on the preparations. Next, guests Lu Jingshi, Lin Kanghou, and Tao Leqin, and variety show director Zhang Baichuan gave speeches. Finally, Deputy Executive Director Zhu Xuefan gave a reply. After the Postal Workers' Orchestra played music, photos were taken, and the ceremony was declared over.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Yu Qiaqing's opening speech briefly stated that the refugees in northern Jiangsu are under the iron heel of the violent Japanese, in the midst of ice and snow. With great righteousness, they pledge their courage and use their hot blood and heads to fight the strong enemy. They sleep in the open air, endure hunger and cold. Their hard work and unwavering spirit are worthy of lasting admiration. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other four groups have specially launched a variety show to raise huge sums of money for relief and plan to use the variety show to promote awareness, hoping to awaken compatriots' attention and jointly provide practical assistance. Report on the Process: Staff member Ren Jinping reported on the preparations, saying that this variety show was initiated by the four groups and that preparations were rushed, so there were many imperfections, for which he expressed deep apologies. It is painful to use variety shows for national salvation. However, he hopes to use the power of variety shows to publicize the suffering of refugees, so that people can increase their efforts to help the Northeast Volunteer Army. The economic invasion of Japan has created its current brutality, so people should vigorously resist Japanese goods to take their lives. He hopes that the people of the country will work together to save the country by supporting the Volunteer Army and rejecting Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Guest Speeches: Lu Jingshi, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, said in his speech that today is the opening day of the sorrowful variety show, which aims to raise money to support the Northeast Volunteer Army. He hopes that all sectors will be able to donate generously after watching it and fulfill the responsibility of the people in the rear to provide assistance. He also hopes to invite friends and relatives to come here to receive national salvation propaganda. Recently, the retreat of Su Bingwen's troops was due to the lack of support from the rear. Therefore, helping the Volunteer Army is to save China, and saving China is to save ourselves. Lin Kanghou, the representative of the Bankers Association, said that we are holding a variety show while the Northeast Volunteer Army is fighting against a strong enemy in great pain. It can be said that playing the qin under a Coptis chinensis tree is making the best of a bad situation. He hopes that everyone, after seeing the show, can spread the word about the suffering of the refugees and donate one more yuan, which will add one more point of strength to the Volunteer Army. If we can do this, China can be saved. Other speeches were given by variety show committee member Zhang Shichuan and Tao Leqin of the Chinese Taxpayers Association. Due to their length, they are not recorded.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments: Finally, Deputy Executive Director Zhu Xuefan gave a thank-you speech, saying that today's opening ceremony has been supported by all sectors. In addition to extending sincere thanks on behalf of the association, there is one more contribution, that is, today's invitation to all sectors is not for entertainment, but to receive propaganda, and it is hoped that after receiving propaganda, everyone can fully develop the spirit of national salvation and do their best to help the Northeast Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>Today's Program: Today's variety show program is extremely rich. The Beijing Opera is performed by famous actors from the Shenshang Club, with their best works, including: Getting the Seal and Returning to the Court, Big Golden Leopard, Catching and Releasing Luodian, Happy Marriage, Zhou Yu's Return to Heaven, Yuexia Sending Han Xin, and Killing Tu Xing Zhao.</p>

<p>Many Works by Famous Artists</p>
<p>Since the National Artists' Exhibition of Works Donated to the Northeast Volunteer Army approached its initial deadline, valuable works from all over the country have been donated one after another, almost too many to handle.

He also donated two vertical scrolls of snow-scene old pines and potted flowers, which are also elegant and vigorous. Song Zhongyuan, who recently graduated from the Grand Art Institute of Paris and returned to China, personally sent six landscape and figure Western paintings from Wuxi, which are superb in color and setting and are certainly not ordinary works. Yang Shouyu from Danyang also sent two axes of pine paintings. Ms. Gu Fei donated more than ten pieces of landscape paintings and calligraphy. Zhang Tiyuan also donated several pages of flower albums. There are many other valuable works, which will be published later.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Women's Temperance Union Suggests Saving Beggars <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Union, in view of the existence of beggars, which violates humanity and humiliates the country, has spared no effort in its work to save beggars for more than a decade. Now that the Municipal Council has been established, the union made a suggestion to the Municipal Council yesterday, asking the Municipal Government to contact the authorities in various concessions to cooperate in carrying out this work. However, as the matter is of great importance, the union earnestly hopes that all groups will rise up to urge the implementation, so that compatriots in this city who are in dire straits can have a place to settle down, setting an example for the whole country. Here is an excerpt from the original text of the suggestion:</p>
<p>For the matter of making a suggestion, every winter, a large number of beggars beg in the streets, which is harmful to humanity, endangers people's livelihoods, disrupts public order, and humiliates the country. In view of this, our union, in addition to establishing the Women and Children's Education and Rehabilitation Center on Xiangyin Road, Jiangwan, to carry out small-scale beggar relief on its own, has repeatedly suggested to the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau to quickly eliminate beggars to enhance the city's appearance and facilitate the people's lives. However, year after year, it has not been implemented. At the beginning of the establishment of your council, our union dares not to presume and earnestly appeals again. If your council can understand public opinion and convey it to the Municipal Government for implementation as soon as possible, the people of the whole city will be grateful without limit. We respectfully present our views as far as we can, briefly stated as follows: "Measures" Please order the responsible subordinates of the Municipal Government (the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus) to quickly contact the Public Concession and the French Concession authorities (as the Chinese area and the concessions are adjacent, if they do not contact each other and cooperate in a unified manner, there will inevitably be the evil of eliminating them here and fleeing there) and various charitable organizations and other important groups in the city to organize a beggar relief committee to plan and implement the work, with special responsibility for implementation. A wise government should first eliminate harm for the people. If beggars can be properly settled, it will not only be the glory of the country's future, but also the desire of the people of the whole city. Whether the above is appropriate is subject to decision. This is addressed to Shi, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, from the Chinese Women's Temperance Union.</p>
<h3 id="e146">The Municipal Government Allocates Funds to the Shelter, Planning to Add a Fifth Location <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organization Federation, concerned about the overcrowded conditions of the South Shanghai Shelter for the Poor and the risk of epidemics due to the recent warm weather, yesterday ordered staff at each location to take preventative measures. The Red Cross also dispatched additional doctors to work with the Shanghai Municipal Hospital to diagnose and treat existing patients separately, and those unable to stay at the shelter were sent to the Xin Pu Yu Tang for treatment to prevent the spread of disease. However, the four existing locations are still insufficient, and representatives will be sent to find a location and plan for a fifth shelter. The fourth shelter, established the other day, was made possible by the enthusiasm of gentleman and merchant Xi Ehan, who arranged for the Jiangyin Guild Hall to be used. Yesterday, the owner of the famous Guan Sheng Yuan store, Xian Guansheng, also sent representative Wang Zhixuan to inspect the shelter out of concern for aiding the poor. General Manager Zhang Zixin received him and guided him on a tour before his return. It is hoped that enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life will continue to step forward and generously donate to benefit the poor.</p>
<p>The federation yesterday cited a directive from the municipal government as the basis for requesting the swift allocation of 3,000 yuan for the shelter. In addition to urging its release, they will proceed directly to the Finance Bureau to claim it. It is also reported that Chairman Wang Yiting and Vice-Chairman Huang Hanzhi of the federation plan to consult with major philanthropists to raise funds for relief and actively proceed with this initiative.</p>
<h3 id="e147">New Water Pipe Installation in South Shanghai <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Based on Water Meter Diameter</p>
<p>Residents in the South Shanghai district who use tap water find that their inlet pipe diameter is often larger than the water meter diameter. For example, a 13mm water meter might be connected to a 20mm inlet pipe. The reason for this is mainly that in the past, the pressure from the inland water company was slightly weaker, and this was intended to compensate. However, this unnecessarily increased labor and material costs. Now that the inland water plant has switched to electric power, the water pressure has increased, and there is no concern about insufficient flow. Moreover, Article 12 of the city's water supply regulations stipulates that the branch pipes in lanes should be installed according to the number of double faucets, based on a 13mm diameter. This means that if a user only installs one pair of faucets and does not plan to add more, a 13mm inlet pipe is sufficient. It is now reported that the responsible department of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has notified all registered water pipe merchants in South Shanghai that in the future, when installing water pipes for users, they should follow the regulations to save costs, unless there is a plan to add more faucets.</p>
<h3 id="e148">County Agricultural Education Center Plans to Establish a Native Cloth Store <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>First Preparatory Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Farmers' Education Center, in order to promote native cloth and improve farmers' livelihoods, previously held two native cloth exhibitions in Shanghai and established a native cloth factory in Zhuanqiao Town. Weavers in various locations were very enthusiastic. To facilitate sales, the center is actively planning to establish a native cloth store and held its first preparatory meeting yesterday at 2 PM. Director Zhang of the center and supporters Wang Renfu, Shen Zhupo, Tang Shuming, Hu Hongkui, and others attended. Chairman Zhang presided over the meeting, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) The location will be temporarily set at Penglai Market, and contacts will be made with various parties starting immediately. (2) The nature of the store will be a partnership store association. (3) The Ximen branch of the Shanghai Savings Bank is designated as the payment institution. (4) Shen Zhupo is nominated to draft the store organization plan for review by the shareholders' meeting. (5) Wang Renfu, Hu Hongkui, Shen Zhupo, Zhang Yi, and Tang Shuming are nominated as members of the preparatory committee, with Zhang Yi as the director of the preparatory committee. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Suing Fo Ci Pharmaceutical Factory for Damaging Reputation <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Fo Ci Pharmaceutical Factory arbitrarily uses a centenarian's photo in newspaper advertisements to promote longevity drugs.</p>
<p>The centenarian sues for 10,000 yuan in damages to support the Northeast Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>Li Fangxiao, a 110-year-old man from Zhengzhou, Henan Province, is a Muslim who resides in the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque inside the Old West Gate. Recently, he hired lawyers Wu Kaisheng and Ni Jiong to file a criminal self-accusation against Feng Mingzheng, manager of the Fo Ci Pharmaceutical Factory at No. 35 Renji Road in the British Concession (Hangzhou native), for damaging his reputation in the First Special District Court. He also filed a civil suit seeking 10,000 yuan in damages. The complaint stated: "To prevent damage to reputation, I request legal investigation and a civil suit. I have always valued morality and self-discipline, which is why I have reached such an advanced age. I have never been criticized by anyone in society. However, on October 19th of this year, my portrait appeared in the newspaper, along with my name and age. It was found that Feng Mingzheng (the defendant), the manager of the Fo Ci Pharmaceutical Factory, published it without my consent to use it as a drug advertisement. This clearly violates my personal rights. Among personal rights, freedom rights and name rights are the most important. The factory manager disregarded this and used my portrait and name as an advertisement to sell drugs to deceive the public and satisfy his desire for illegitimate gains. People will suspect that I received illegal benefits from the factory, which is why I allowed them to use my name and photo as a tool for deception. This has greatly damaged my reputation and credibility. I have lived to a great age and have never taken the longevity drugs produced by the factory. Regardless of whether the drug has the effect of prolonging life, the very meaning of the words 'longevity' and 'anti-aging' is illogical, which proves its fraudulence. Moreover, it was published without my consent, which further confirms that the drugs they sell are not what they claim. Those who are deceived will inevitably affect me, which is undoubtedly. Therefore, I specially request your court to take note, order the defendant Feng Mingzheng to appear in court, and punish him for the crime under Article 330 of the Criminal Code. Furthermore, I request that the entire judgment be published in accordance with Article 332 of the same law so that the public is aware. As for the civil suit, I request that the defendant be ordered to compensate me for 10,000 yuan in damages in accordance with Article 19 of the Civil Code, which I will use to support the Northeast Volunteer Army to clarify rewards and punishments and maintain human rights." The court approved the request. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zhen presided over the hearing. The old man, Li Fangxiao, was energetic, with white hair and a youthful face, and a white beard that reached his abdomen. Wearing a leather hat and a blue cloth robe, he stood in the plaintiff's witness box and spoke eloquently, saying that the defendant used his photo for advertising to make money, disregarding his wishes, and made insulting remarks about religion and superstition. The defendant, Feng Mingzheng, testified that he was 26 years old, and the plaintiff's photo was taken by a certain introducer at the Jixing Photo Studio in the French Concession. Because he enjoyed longevity, which is rare these days, it was printed in the newspaper to show that China has such a long-lived old man, so that Chinese and foreigners would respect him, and not to use it for advertising. He said that he had obtained consent before taking the photo. The old man denied this, saying that the defendant's words were false and that he had never been to the Jixing Photo Studio and had never met him. The defendant said that the photo studio had already closed down and the owner had left Shanghai, otherwise, he could be called to testify. He also said that after the newspaper was published, the plaintiff sent a letter scolding him, and he immediately replied to apologize, saying that he respected his age and printed it in the newspaper without any other intention. Judge Wu ordered both parties to withdraw and set a date for further review. This scene of a centenarian arguing with a young man in court is truly unprecedented.</p>

<p>Wu Panzhang, a 17-year-old apprentice from Anhui at the Universal Factory on Yokohama Road in Zhabei, had a quarrel with a colleague, Mr. Jia, after dinner around 6 PM yesterday due to a trivial matter. He was humiliated by Mr. Jia, and afterwards, Wu became depressed and despondent, leading him to contemplate suicide. He took raw opium, and soon, the symptoms appeared and became uncontrollable.

<p>Recently, the trams of the China Tramway Company have been extremely crowded, and boarding and alighting takes a lot of time, which interferes with the scheduled timetable. Therefore, at each stop, there are often incidents of rushing to ring the bell and start the tram. Yesterday at 3:30 PM, Tram No. 48 on Route 3 of the company was passing the Fangbang Bridge station when Hua Shousong, a 26-year-old clerk from Ying County in the Personnel Section of the First Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and his wife, Ma Maihe, 27, were boarding the tram at the station. Because there were still many passengers who had not alighted, they stood by the tram and waited. Unexpectedly, the ticket seller No. 29 immediately rang the bell, and the tram started. The couple was pushed against the tram by the alighting passengers and dragged by the tram. Only after the crowd shouted loudly did the tram stop. Hua's right face was slightly scratched, and Hua's wife's right leg was slightly injured, but the buttons on her cheongsam were torn off. They immediately negotiated with the ticket seller. Subsequently, police officer Zhou Weidong from Post No. 5 of the Second District arrived to mediate. As a result, the tram was allowed to continue, but the clerk Hua Shousong removed the copper badge of ticket seller No. 29 and went to the Second District Headquarters with the police officer to report the incident. The district chief was out, so the district police chief Hu Naitong registered the incident and reported it to the district chief, pending further investigation.</p>

Anyone who can find the girl and send her to the Tian family will be rewarded with 100 yuan, and no questions will be asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Weng's message: I am thirty-one years old this year and currently working as a principal in an elementary school, with an annual salary of less than three hundred yuan! Besides supporting a wife and two young daughters, I also have to support two elderly mothers and four younger siblings. In recent years, things have not gone well at work, resulting in debts of over three thousand yuan. Now that the end of the year is approaching, those seeking repayment are constantly at my door. I have considered suicide several times to end my life, but I feel uneasy about my young children! In this dilemma, I implore you, sir, to provide me with a complete solution, so that I may find a glimmer of hope. Your merit would be truly immeasurable!</p>
<p>Reply: We deeply sympathize with your meager income and heavy burdens. Moreover, this kind of difficulty is not unique to you; seven or eight out of ten people in the country experience it. We receive numerous letters daily recounting financial difficulties, and this is truly a societal problem that is difficult to alleviate individually. Therefore, your letter asking us for a complete solution... A method isn't without existence, but it would take a long explanation, and the result still wouldn't be able to relieve your "immediate crisis." What we can offer you at present is only the advice to "endure and cope." In our opinion, owing debts is not illegal. Since your debt is not due to your own extravagance, society should be more forgiving. If society isn't forgiving, then just face them with nothing to your name and let society curse you as it pleases. They won't swallow you whole, so what are you afraid of? Are you afraid of not having food in the future? If being a "principal" doesn't work out, the whole family can work. As long as you can endure hardship, you won't starve. If you think that working is shameful, then your thinking is deteriorating, and there's nothing we can do about it. As for your talk of "suicide," that's even more ridiculous. You're alive in this world, so you should ask society for food, why commit suicide?</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Qian's message: I am a twenty-year-old youth who, due to difficult circumstances, only completed junior high school. Three years ago, I was introduced to work through a relative. Now, based on my observations in service, I deeply need advanced knowledge and want to continue my studies in school to avoid lacking opportunities in the future. However, when seeking opinions from relatives and friends, very few express sympathy. For the sake of careful consideration, I cannot help but seek your guidance. My relatives and friends' opinions can be generally summarized as follows: "What's the use of studying? Aren't many college graduates unable to find jobs these days? Isn't it still those with power who can secure a livelihood?" This is what experienced colleagues and elders say. "There are no truly good schools to study in now. It's better to self-study or take supplementary classes in your spare time. You should know that we can learn anywhere; school is just one way to study," a relative said very earnestly to me. They all make very good points. On one hand, I also feel that what is learned in school now doesn't meet the needs of society, and it would be a pity to give up my position, so I'm hesitant! But if I miss this opportunity, I'm afraid I won't have another chance to study, which makes me extremely troubled! Sir, my circumstances are difficult, as mentioned above. The debt my family incurred for my junior high school education has only just been cleared. Now, I only have some savings that can cover two years of schooling. If I go back to school, then I will have to borrow again, and my debt will definitely be even greater! Beloved sir, in my situation, should I continue my studies or take supplementary classes in my spare time? How should we young people strive to learn so that we can achieve success in our careers? Finally, I hope for your sincere advice so that I can quickly decide on a path. I am extremely grateful.</p>
<p>Reply: Your ambition for learning is deeply admirable! Of the two points mentioned in your letter, the latter is very correct. Given your family's difficult economic situation, continuing to study in school would indeed be difficult in reality. It is best to pursue self-study in your spare time. You should know that if a person has true knowledge, their background is completely irrelevant. You don't need to be troubled.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Danchi's message: At the age of eighteen, I already became a victim of the old feudal marriage system. When discussing marriage, I firmly resisted, but needless to say, that resistance was ineffective. So I had to resign myself to fate, hoping that the heavens would have mercy and grant me a good wife! Heaven knows, she is hopeless. Thus, after living together for less than two nights, our walls of opposition were already firmly built. After the wedding, the second night, I brought up the matter of divorce. This she did not consider a problem, because she had this as her backing: "I didn't come to you for nothing; I was brought back with a grand wedding." Relying on these two phrases, she can wantonly display her inferiorities. What kind of person is she actually? I know that a toad doesn't dare to dream of swan meat, but a woman like her is truly frightening to behold, and I truly can't bear to endure her anymore. She hasn't read any books, has a body full of bad habits, speaks extremely abruptly, and will start a fight at the slightest provocation. As for her appearance, that's beyond discussion. I can only adopt passive means and have distanced myself from her for more than four years. Now, I only want to divorce her, but she consistently disagrees, and my old mother is also unwilling. But when I consider the wishes and interests of those two, my personal happiness and future are completely forfeited, which I absolutely cannot do. What can be done? Here I want to ask: If the other party doesn't agree, can I unilaterally file for divorce with the court or issue a statement in the newspaper to sever relations? Can forced marriages of the past be declared invalid now? Before these questions are resolved, can I have a loving relationship with another woman or discuss marriage? When discussing it, should I clearly tell her about my family situation or keep it a secret for now? If necessary, can I declare a break from family relations as a complete solution?</p>
<p>Reply: The lack of freedom in marriage is indeed a kind of pain felt by the majority of modern youth. If the situation described in your letter is true, then divorce is the right thing to do. However, divorce requires certain legal procedures. A unilateral statement in the newspaper to sever relations is not effective. The best scenario is naturally a divorce by mutual agreement. If one party doesn't agree, then it must be decided by the court. According to Article 1052 of the current Civil Code, divorce must meet certain conditions. Therefore, from a legal perspective, divorce at present cannot be said to be absolutely free. Regarding this point, you must consider this yourself when suing the court. Also, before the marital relationship is severed, you cannot marry another person, otherwise, it constitutes bigamy, which must not be attempted.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education proposes to the National Congress that no new middle schools should be established within two years. The Ministry of Education plans to propose to the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee that no new public or private general middle schools should be established within two years, and that efforts should be made to improve and enrich the existing public and private middle schools in terms of quality. The detailed proposal is currently being drafted and should be submitted to the General Assembly for review in the coming days.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Teachers and Staff of Middle Schools in Jiangsu Province Continue to Petition <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Submitting Opinions to the Ministry of Education on Methods of Service for Teachers and Staff</p>
<p>Requesting that the Education Funding Management Office issue at least one month's cash advance</p>
<p>More than 30 representatives from various schools attending the Interim Plenary Representatives Conference of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Teachers and Staff (Zhang Shaonan from Huaiyin arrived today) gathered at the Second Hospital of Nanzhong on the morning of the 17th to discuss funding matters. Although the Management Office has agreed to issue notices in installments, this is a long-term solution that cannot meet immediate needs. Therefore, at a minimum, they must receive cash advances for the second half of August and the first half of September before they can leave Beijing and return to their respective schools. The representatives from seven schools, including Nanzhong, Suzhou Middle School, Zhenjiang Normal School, Yangzhou Middle School, Shanghai Middle School, Wuxi Middle School, and Wujiang Rural Normal School, who were sent to the Ministry of Education to petition yesterday, returned to the meeting place at noon to report. When they went to the Ministry of Education in the morning, they were received by Gu Shusen, Director of the General Education Department. The representatives stated that the "Methods of Service and Treatment for Teachers and Staff of Secondary Schools" promulgated by the Ministry of Education did not conform to actual conditions and expressed their opinions in accordance with the resolutions: 1. Implement a full-time system and not calculate salaries based on teaching hours. 2. The number of teaching hours per week is too high and should be reduced. 3. Salaries should be increased. 4. The median of teaching hours should be used to calculate the median of salaries. 5. Those who take on class training duties should have their teaching hours reduced. 6. Eliminate the difficulty of elective courses. 7. The Legislative Yuan passed the "Organizational Law of Normal Schools," but there is no status for rural normal schools, and remedial measures should be requested. Director Gu replied: 1. Regarding the curriculum standards, the Ministry has decided to implement them for new students admitted in the fall of next year. The existing grades will follow the old standards (i.e., those who have already taken electives will continue until graduation, without changes midway). The reason for abolishing the elective system is that independent vocational schools of various types, including normal schools, have already been established. General middle schools are for the purpose of further education, so it is not appropriate to have electives. Compulsory subjects should be studied. 2. Regarding the issue of rural normal schools, there are currently 559 rural normal schools nationwide. Since difficulties have arisen in practice, the Ministry of Education has already submitted a proposal to the Central Political Council requesting that a way be found to supplement the policy. In the future, rural normal schools may be added to the Organizational Law of Normal Schools. 3. Regarding the issues of service and treatment, such as teaching hours, the Ministry of Education originally drafted the standards to be similar to those set by provincial schools. During the meeting, the standards were revised by various committee members with reference to the teaching hours of teachers in Western countries. Now that difficulties are being felt, fortunately, there is room for flexibility in the instructions of the methods promulgated by the Ministry. The public generally agreed that the Executive Committee should submit a document to the Department of Education requesting that the Ministry of Education make appropriate changes to the previously promulgated methods based on actual circumstances. The meeting adjourned in the afternoon. At 7 PM in the evening, all the representatives went to the Education Funding Management Office, where they were received by Director Niu. Director Niu reported that Section Chief Yang had not returned, and he had written a letter to Chairman Gu of the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday evening to earnestly entrust him to work with the Finance Department to come up with a solution. Therefore, the current fund-raising is being carried out in three ways: 1. Demanding outstanding payments from the Provincial Government. 2. Urging various departments to lend money. 3. Borrowing money from banks. By gathering funds from these three sources, it should be possible to achieve the desired outcome. Wu Dezhang reported that the representatives had decided that the minimum requirement was one month's cash advance. Liu Beihe reported that the notice for the second half of August could be filled out the day after tomorrow and the funds could be withdrawn on the 25th of this month. The notice for September must wait until the audit meeting on the 25th to be signed. The due date for withdrawal is between the 10th and 15th of January. The notice for October will also be signed at the audit meeting on December 25th. The due date for withdrawal is between the 15th and 25th of January. The notice for November can be allocated to the counties for collection. After exchanging opinions, the situation will be reported in detail tomorrow.</p>

<p>Both the senior and junior high school departments of Jiangsu Provincial Suzhou Middle School have spring classes, which is one of the school's special features. As a rule, new students are recruited once during the winter vacation each year. It is heard that this year, one class will be recruited for the first grade of junior high school and one class for the first grade of senior high school's chemical engineering department. The school's chemical engineering department was established in the spring of 1932 with the main purpose of cultivating intermediate chemical technology talents. After graduating in three years, graduates can work in the chemical technology industry or take the college entrance examination for chemical engineering departments. The school's chemical factories have now established two: one for general practice and one for the specialized production of soap and candles. Expansion in the future is rumored to have a three-year plan. The examination period for this year is set for February 3rd and 4th. It is said that those who request prospectuses have been flooding in.</p>

<p>According to a previous survey, there were 575 returned overseas Chinese students.

Specifically, 33 at Yenching University, 32 at the Second Normal School of Guangdong Province, 9 at Pudong Middle School, 7 at Nanyang Business College Senior High School, 6 each at Fu Jen Catholic University and the affiliated high school of Shanghai University, 5 at Chih Chih College, 3 each at Hongda Middle School, Wuben Girls' High School, Xinhua Art School, Nanjing Cultural College, Guangzhou National University, and Fujian Provincial Polytechnic Middle School, 2 each at Guanghua Girls' High School, Huiven Girls' High School, YMCA Middle School, Lingdong Commercial School, and Hongying Middle School, 1 each at Jingye Middle School, Soochow University Law School, Guangzhou University, Sacred Heart Middle School, Pui Ying Middle School, Fuzhou Middle School, and Patriotic Girls' School.

<p>Since the start of this semester, the teachers and students of Jiangsu Provincial Nantong Middle School have been working together and making every effort to improve the school's affairs. Previously, they established a centennial savings fund, expanded the library, and prepared to establish a history and geography museum. In order to promote student effort and improve their level, they held a mathematics competition and a Chinese essay contest, with good results. When Director Zhou of the Department of Education came to Tongzhou to inspect, all the best essays were sent to Director Zhou for review and evaluation. The best in mathematics was Zou Qiang, a senior high school student, and the best in essay writing were Qian Tong, a senior high school student, and Shi Yuxiu, a junior high school girl. In addition, the school also recently held a Mandarin speech contest, with Xu Chengqiang from the senior high school group winning first place and Sun Yongzhang from the junior high school group winning first place.</p>

<p>(4) Changing Things in the Middle of the Academic Year Only Creates Confusion</p>
<p>This is a matter of fact. The allocation of teachers' time, the arrangement of timetables, and the selection of courses must all go through a considerable period of preparation, usually before the start of the first semester, to prepare for the work of the entire academic year. At the start of the second semester, only minor changes can be made. Now, completely overturning the old regulations and with nothing to base things on, each school must re-establish new regulations, stipulate transitional measures, dismiss some old teachers, hire new teachers, establish new timetables, and select new textbooks. All these things cannot be done immediately. The losses to the school and the losses to the students during this period are unknown. Anyone with some experience in school administration knows this situation and need not elaborate.</p>
<p>(5) The Number of Service Hours Stipulated for Middle School Teachers and Staff is Too Ideal. According to the new methods promulgated by the Ministry of Education, full-time teachers in secondary schools, in addition to bearing responsibility for moral education and extracurricular self-study guidance, must teach 22 to 26 hours per week in junior high school and 20 to 24 hours per week in senior high school. In special circumstances, this must be increased appropriately. The teaching time for staff members who teach is based on the teaching time of full-time teachers. At a minimum, the principal must teach no less than one-half, and the head of academic affairs and the head of moral education must teach no less than two-thirds. Experience tells us that this standard is untenable. In American middle schools, teachers teach an average of 21 to 22 hours a week. In Japanese middle schools, teachers teach an average of 19 hours. According to our country's experience, it is most appropriate for responsible original teachers (of course, the Ministry of Education hopes that every teacher is responsible) to teach 18 to 20 hours per week. If teachers participate in some extracurricular work in addition to these many hours, they are already busy enough. If they must take on moral education duties and self-study guidance, their hours must be reduced by two or three hours per week. We know that for every hour of teaching, the preparation before class and the handling after class must take at least one or two hours (if the time is shorter, the book will definitely not be taught well). Therefore, teaching 20 hours of class, plus the time spent on extracurricular activities, plus the time spent on preparation and handling, already requires more than 50 hours. If we follow the regulations of the Ministry of Education, each teacher must work more than 80 hours a week, otherwise, they can only buy books in the classroom, and they cannot pay attention to any preparation, practice, looking at notes, correcting compositions, grading exam papers, etc. According to our experience, principals, heads of academic affairs, and heads of moral education can teach at most 8 or 9 hours of lessons per week. Any more will hinder their duties.</p>
<p>I remember Russell saying in his book "Education and the Modern World," "A young person has a desire for knowledge. The disappearance of this desire is mostly because the knowledge given to them exceeds their needs and capacity, just as children all like food, but once they are forced, they develop an unwelcome attitude." We hope that the curriculum promulgated by the Ministry of Education will take into account the abilities of young people and their interests, and not provide them with knowledge that they cannot accept, and not force them to learn lessons that they do not particularly like. "Children must first be treated as children, and only then as students." Knowledge is certainly important, but other aspects may be equally important. We further hope that the Ministry of Education will take into account the abilities and interests of teachers and staff. Education is a spiritual undertaking. To improve the spirit of teachers and staff, we must use effective methods, and we cannot forcibly increase their workload. Chinese education is like an unopened flower, which has suffered the ravages of wind and rain, exposing a state of hardship. We only hope that the Ministry of Education will be a protector of flowers, paying attention to cultivation and no longer doing things that stifle growth. That dying flower may be able to see the sun again, donate fragrance, and absorb the air of freedom. (End)</p>

<p>Presumed Captains and Managers of Each Team, Additional Cross-Country Race in Hangzhou</p>
<p>(Hangzhou Communication) Hangzhou Mayor Zhao Zhiyou, in order to promote sports and increase sports interest, specially invited famous Shanghai Chinese and Western basketball teams to Hangzhou for performances and formulated a schedule. In addition to the performance matches, although the Hangzhou side knew that their skills were inferior, in order to express their welcome, they specially arranged a few friendly matches with the Shanghai teams. It is really impossible to compare the wins and losses. It is known that the Hangzhou side is now actively preparing to presume the captains and managers of each team. The team members still need to be selected before they can be determined. The list of captains and managers of each team is as follows:</p>
<p>Football Team Captain Yang Youmei, Manager Zhang Meisheng, Team Members Liao Shiming and other sixteen people.</p>
<p>Women's Basketball Team Captain Zhou Bian, Manager Su Zhong, Team Members Hong Zhe and three female middle school students, four high school students.</p>
<p>Tennis Team Manager Cheng Dingyuan, Team Members Jian Naixin and Ouyang Xuhui. Hangzhou Mayor Zhao also invited the Shanghai Chinese Cross-Country Team to Hangzhou for a performance. The route will be around Hangzhou City for one week. Sixteen people from Shanghai will participate, and the Hangzhou side will select eight people to join. The captain is Kuang Ruhui, the manager is Li Zanhao, and the team members are Chai Huanjin and other eight people. It is heard that they will start practicing next Tuesday. The Chinese team will show off their national power in the preliminary round of the international soccer tournament.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Seven to Two Defeat Russia England and Scotland Both Win <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>China, England, Italy, and Scotland Enter the Quarterfinals This Week</p>
<p>The preliminary round of the International Football Tournament, in which seven powerful nations are competing, was held yesterday. The Chinese team played against Russia at the baseball field, England against Portugal, and Scotland against the Jews, all at the racecourse. There were many spectators in all three games, and the baseball field was especially lively. Victory and defeat are inevitable. The results of the games are that China, England, and Scotland have all advanced to the quarterfinals and will meet with Italy, who has a bye, to compete for the championship.</p>
<h3 id="e183">China Defeats Russia Seven to Two <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Football Tournament opened. China first met Russia at the Chinese baseball field. Under the execution of referee Jiang Xiangqing, in front of more than 6,000 spectators, the two teams competed for ninety minutes. The Russian army opened the scoring. China scored three consecutive goals. Russia then won back one goal, making the score four to two, with China taking the lead. After regrouping for the second half, China scored three more goals, defeating the Russian army seven to two. With the preliminary victory, they jumped into the quarterfinals. It is expected that the national emblem of the Blue Sky and White Sun will gradually rise above all countries, raising the eyebrows and exhaling for our Shanghai people.</p>
<p>▲ Re-Establishing Diplomatic Relations, Celebrating on the Field Amidst the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the Chinese and Russian soccer teams met at the baseball field during the preliminary round of the Shanghai International Football Tournament. They shook hands and celebrated, creating a different atmosphere. Many Russians watched from the sidelines, sitting among the Chinese, discussing skills, as if they were long-lost friends reunited. China lost a goal first. Commentators said that it was showing the hospitality of the host. Later, China entered a no-man's land, striving to develop accurate shooting. Why only win by seven to two? Perhaps the goal of victory has been achieved, and more or less is the same.</p>
<p>▲ Good Men Toil for the Country It was expected that Russia was not our enemy. The score of seven to two was inevitable. Yesterday, the Chinese front defeated Russia with ease. The eleven warriors can be called heroic veterans. The five tigers of the forward line each had their own construction. The right side was better than the left, because of the connection. The midfield line participated in the forward line, so the attacking power was strong. However, sometimes the distance from the inner guard was too far. Whenever the enemy came, they could not return to save in time. The inner guards Jiang and Gu assisted each other well. Goalkeeper Lu Zhongen was qualified and worthy, and the two goals lost were not his fault.</p>
<p>▲ Doing Their Best, They Were Still Honorable in Defeat The Russian team was led by Shagu and two representatives, Pi Bu, ministers in the Western Union Group B. The goalkeeper was stable and had few mistakes. The inner guards were weak and poorly positioned. The center was quite experienced, but the left and right assistants were not their people. The two wings were like decorations, with little contribution. The three midfielders ran quickly and had hard feet. Occasionally, they gained momentum, which was surprising. Left inner Kexin was a dangerous figure among the forwards, scoring two goals, which was clear and commendable. Given time, they will also be a strong team.</p>
<p>▲ Five Minutes of Sudden Surprise and Joy China's attack had not been long before they were penalized with a free kick. A spark ignited the prairie, and a ball flew far to the left, then turned into the field. As the Russian army pounced, Nie Gulaev, the center forward, suddenly kicked, and the hidden arrow hurt people. China first lost a point. The center restarted, and the five roads advanced in unison. Chen Hongguang hooked to the right, and Mei Hongmai kicked out, and the Russian goal fell. The score became equal. After the restart, China pressed again, and Hai Hongmai kicked the corner. The ball fell in front of the goal, and Chen Jiaqiu flicked it into the net. In the space of five minutes, one point was scored, one surprise and one joy, which was both tearful and laughing. ▲ Under Pressure, the Russian Army Fought Hard, and China Turned Defeat into Victory The morale was greatly boosted. Within the Russian army's area, footsteps were everywhere. Li Yichen's shot and Chen Hongguang's header were only inches away, again and again. As if blessed by God, Kexin was ambitious and led his troops to invade. Jiang intercepted halfway, and Li Yichen made a comeback. Vlad kissed the ball with his hand and was penalized with a twelve-yard penalty. Li Yichen's ambition was finally fulfilled, making the score three to one. China's encircling attack was formed, and the midfield line also assisted. The Russian goalkeeper looked left and right, showing his skills. The disaster started before his eyes. Three Russian generals rushed into the formation. Kexin kicked and cut the post into the net. Two minutes later, Tu Kaiyuan sent a ball from afar, unintentionally asking for it, but it was actually the wind that sent it into the goal, gaining an unexpected income. In the first half, China had four, and the Russian army had two.</p>
<p>▲ Stone Hits Egg China Wins Big In the second half, China's offensive was still strong. In the blink of an eye, Chen Jiaqiu shot at the goal, Vlad and Chen Hong jumped up at the same time to meet the ball, hitting the enemy's shoulder and bouncing into the goal, making it five to two. The Russian army fought back and launched several counterattacks, but was either blocked by Jiang and Gu or rejected by the goalkeeper. After twenty minutes, Chen Jia personally contributed, making it six to two. After another wave of wind and waves, Chen Hongguang shot the final seventh ball. After that, although the competition was fierce, it was not easy to go deep. After fighting to the end, China won a big victory with seven to two.</p>

<p>The England-Portugal group competed fiercely at the racecourse. The situation was also tense and attracted much attention. Portugal was eliminated by England with a score of three to one due to the inaccuracy of the forwards' shooting and the slowness of their movements. England won the right to the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>Kexin Surprised Everyone Portugal's momentum was strong at the beginning, repeatedly threatening the English army. England, although possessing a very strong army, was also busy coping. At twenty-five minutes, Goshansav, the left wing of the Portuguese army, dribbled the ball straight in and kicked it diagonally. Aimozhi caught it but failed, and it fell in front of the goal. Kela, the center forward, caught up and shot, flying into the net. Portugal opened the scoring first, and there were both surprises and joys.</p>
<p>The Little Ma Sai Still Depended on His Color Seven minutes after the first goal, the English army counterattacked to the Portuguese goal. Sai, the young general of the Western Bu, was extremely active. He shot from the left corner to the Portuguese goal from afar. Goalkeeper Cross thought the ball had fallen behind the goal, not knowing that the ball had just passed over Kerr's head and slowly fallen into the goal. England thus tied the score with Portugal at one to one. Afterwards, although the Portuguese army had opportunities, they could not take advantage of them. Otherwise, the English army would have become a defeated army. The first half ended in a one to one draw.</p>
<p>Another Two Goals Make It Three to One At the beginning of the second half, the English army was greatly boosted and pounced on the Portuguese goal with all their might. In just a few minutes, when they were besieging the Portuguese goal, the English army suddenly got a chance to be penalized with twelve yards. Gash swept it in the middle, and England then took the lead with two to one. After another ten minutes, the left wing Ma Sai repeated the attack on the Portuguese army, following the same pattern, passing over the goalkeeper's head and flying into the goal. From then on, the English army won with three to one until the end.</p>
<p>The Performances of the English and Portuguese Armies The English midfield and rear guard lines were the strongest. Among the forwards, the two wings were the most active. Defei and Barton were more clumsy. Portugal could not win under the strong momentum in the first half, knowing that it would be defeated. The goalkeeper was very popular, and among the others, Gushitai in the center and Kelasha in the center forward, the old generals did not lose their prestige. In the Portuguese army, they were like chickens leading cranes. Unfortunately, Kel had no one to assist him, and one palm could not clap. It was also a regrettable thing.</p>

<p>Scotland eliminated the Jews with a score of eight to zero. The Jews are not as good as before. This group was all one-sided, allowing the Scottish army to do whatever it wanted. Fortunately, the goalkeeper was steady and saved a lot of dangerous balls, otherwise the score would not have stopped there.</p>
<p>Two Goals in the First Half The Scottish army attacked with all their might, often missing opportunities. The Jewish goalkeeper showed his agility, but the effect was minimal. It was not until twenty minutes later that Hughes sent a ball from the corner, and Klagg topped it to open the scoring. Three minutes after the goal, Backster passed in the middle, the goalkeeper rushed out of the goal, and Jack flicked it in. Scotland won the first half with two to zero.</p>
<p>Eight Goals in the Second Half At the beginning of the second half, the Jews could not maintain it any longer. Scotland continued to have three forwards, Hughes, Meng Tai Fei Xu, and Kragg, score six more goals, ending the game with eight to zero. The entire Scottish line was good, but the rear guard was slightly worse. Helly was the most outstanding. The Jewish movements were too slow, often liking to intercept the ball and dribble, not paying attention to contact, which was their weakness and the reason for their failure.</p>

<p>Fudan Students Assault Referee</p>
<p>The Jiangnan University Athletic Association's football matches have historically been rife with disputes, including players fighting each other or referees being beaten. The match between Zhong Gong and Guanghua a few years ago even resulted in bloodshed and litigation, which is not a good sign for university football. Yesterday, Fudan and Jiaotong Universities competed at Jiangwan. The two sides were evenly matched and neither achieved a breakthrough. The referee, Chen Jixiang, is astute and capable, and one of the best Chinese football referees in Shanghai. Aware of the difficulty of refereeing Jiangnan University football matches, he was particularly careful yesterday, observing everything meticulously and impartially. Therefore, the competition between the two teams was very peaceful, and the result was a draw, which should not have led to any unfortunate events. Unexpectedly, after the match ended, a small number of Fudan students expressed their dissatisfaction with the referee. They shouted for an attack and surrounded Chen Jixiang. Foreign-style wooden instruments flew through the air. The captain of the Fudan cheerleading squad, wearing a baseball catcher's chest protector and mask, struck Chen on the head with a baseball bat. His scalp was cut open, and blood flowed profusely, staining his shirt collar. Order was immediately disrupted, and Jiangnan University football suffered another bloody incident.</p>
<p>Equal Strength Between the Two Teams: Jinan, Jiaotong, and Fudan Universities are the Most Hopeful Contenders for the Jiangnan University Title This Year. Yesterday, Fudan and Jiaotong Universities competed at Jiangwan Fudan University. Because of the importance of the match, Chen Jixiang, a famous football referee from the Chinese Athletic Referees Association, was specially invited to officiate. Students from both universities enthusiastically cheered their teams. Although Jiaotong University had a long journey, more than a hundred supporters accompanied the team. The two teams were evenly matched, with balanced attacks. The forwards and defenders all performed well, but they lacked scoring talent, resulting in no goals. However, the performance was quite satisfactory. A Glimpse of the Competition: The match started at 2:30 PM. The two sides had equal attacks and were evenly matched. Near the end of the first half, Jiaotong University had a strong momentum and repeatedly tried to penetrate Fudan's goal, but Fudan's defense was tight, and there was no opportunity. At the beginning of the second half, Fudan was full of energy and aggressive, launching repeated attacks. However, Yu Xuzhang repeatedly missed opportunities, much to his frustration. Later, Jiaotong University counterattacked Fudan, but was also unsuccessful. With only ten minutes left, both sides were determined to win, and the situation suddenly became tense. Wan Xianghua of Jiaotong University attempted a side attack on Fudan's goal but missed. Fudan then advanced. Long Yixun shot the ball within Jiaotong University's penalty area, hitting a Jiaotong University defender on the shoulder. Fudan students shouted, "Jiaotong University committed a handball!" The situation became chaotic, and shouts filled the air. Some people even attempted to attack the referee, but they were stopped by Fudan instructor Chen Bingde and the players. The match continued, and the result was a draw. The Behavior of University Students: The match ended in a draw, and it was thought that everything would be peaceful. Unexpectedly, Fudan students were unwilling to accept the result and protested against the referee Chen Jixiang. Shouts arose from all around, and they rushed onto the field, surrounding Chen. They temporarily used trumpets, flagpoles, and other items as weapons, throwing them around in the air, causing great chaos. The captain of the cheerleading squad, wearing a baseball catcher's chest protector and mask, charged into the crowd, wielding a baseball bat as if facing a formidable enemy, and struck Chen on the head, breaking his scalp and causing profuse bleeding. Chen was then protected by Fudan players and taken to the gymnasium office. Such behavior by university students is regrettable. The lineups of the two teams yesterday were as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e197">Inaugural Address <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— The Editor</p>
<p>The purpose of publishing the Medical Weekly in this newspaper is threefold.</p>
<p>Humans cannot avoid illness. When illness strikes, one naturally seeks a swift recovery. This basic knowledge of medicine and pharmaceuticals is indispensable in life. This is the first reason.</p>
<p>With the advancement of science, various academic disciplines are constantly evolving and progressing with the times. Medicine and pharmaceuticals are no exception. Having been born in the twentieth century, it is imperative that we have at least a basic understanding of modern medicine and its trends. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>Medicine is a specialized academic discipline, and indeed, one of the most important academic disciplines in the world. Its relationship with the public is profound and intimate. Specialized academic disciplines must also strive for universalization, allowing more people to study them, progressing from the simple to the profound, specializing in their field, or at least grasping the main points, reconciling diverse opinions. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>In recent times, human affairs have become increasingly complex, and the opportunities for illness have also increased. It is imperative to understand how to prevent illness, how to avoid illness, how to seek a swift recovery, how to seek medical care, and how to seek medication. This publication will pay particular attention to these issues, allowing scholars to fully utilize their abilities and the people to achieve longevity. We have specially commissioned experts to write articles, publishing them periodically. We hope that readers will find them useful. Please start reading from today.</p>
<h3 id="e198">A Bird's-Eye View of Medicine and Pharmaceuticals in Shanghai in the Last Decade <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>

<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>Shanghai is a large city with thriving commerce and a large population. It is not only the premier city of China but also a famous city in East Asia. Illness is inevitable in life, and medicine and pharmaceuticals are daily necessities. Therefore, it is worth discussing them. The significance of this article published to society is to seek a definite understanding of medicine and pharmaceuticals in Shanghai among the general public, so that they can work together to improve them. Extending this to the whole country, Shanghai can serve as a model. However, before entering the main text, there are several declarations:</p>
<p>(A) The author is a "new doctor" (commonly known as a Western doctor) and naturally speaks from a scientific standpoint. However, he does not attack "old doctors" (commonly known as Chinese doctors or national doctors). If people with "anti-scientific tendencies" are angered by this, then so be it. The metaphors and analogies in the text are intended to be clear and engaging and do not carry any intention of disrespect. Honest advice is unpleasant to the ear, and readers should understand my good intentions.</p>
<p>(B) The author has very little resentment toward colleagues. However, by nature, I do not seek personal gain, and my statements are inevitably straightforward. This article does not target any particular group. All the records in the text are based on verifiable facts and are not fabricated.</p>
<p>(C) In addition to practicing medicine in Shanghai, the author has always been fond of managing the public affairs of groups, such as medical associations, medical schools, and hospitals. Therefore, I believe that I have a relatively comprehensive understanding of the relationship between society and medicine and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the topic is called a "bird's-eye view," but there is no arrogance or intention to look down on everything.</p>
<p>(D) The author has only been practicing medicine for twelve years, so I only discuss the situation in the last decade. Coincidentally, the past decade has been the most bizarre in the medical and pharmaceutical fields. Although the article discusses both medicine and pharmaceuticals, I dare not discuss the medical field too much and still maintain the attitude of a semi-outsider.</p>
<p>(E) For the sake of clarity, a page of geometric charts is included in the text (see below). If readers carefully read it, they can get a bird's-eye view of medicine and pharmaceuticals in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(F) Although this article discusses medicine and pharmaceuticals in general, it also appropriately separates them into categories: (1) the situation of medical and pharmaceutical theories, (2) the situation of medical and pharmaceutical business operations, (3) the situation of medical and pharmaceutical politics, and (4) the conclusion.</p>
<p>(G) Although this article is published in the Shen Bao, it is my personal opinion and does not represent the views of the Shen Bao. The author is responsible for everything.</p>
<p>(2) The Situation of Academic Theories (The Dispute Between New and Old Medicine) New medicine entered China initially through foreign missionaries. At that time, foreign medicine was not very developed. The number of Western doctors in China was very small and could be said to be merely decorative. Therefore, there was no dispute between new and old medicine. Since various countries have greatly promoted medicine in the past fifty years and have indeed made inventions that benefit the world, coupled with the return of batches of students studying abroad, new knowledge has been continuously imported. China's political system is reforming day by day. Therefore, the dispute between new and old theories is inevitable, especially in the past decade. In fact, society needs to recognize that the awakening of old medicine by new medicine is stimulated by the global scientific trend. It is definitely not a matter of a few people engaging in factionalism and seeking their own livelihood. Furthermore, other academic theories, such as politics, law, economics, architecture, and engineering, all gladly improve following new trends, without dissent. Why is medicine an exception? It is incomprehensible. In my personal opinion, this is probably because our country has very little emphasis on the word "medicine" and rarely promotes it, mixing it with divination, astrology, and physiognomy. Because it is not valued by the rulers, it has caused civil disputes.</p>
<p>The point of contention between new and old medicine is the diagnosis of diseases, not the medicines used to treat them. I am afraid that many people in society still swallow everything whole, only seeing it as you competing for business. You must know that medicines are originally herbs, tree bark, minerals, and salts. There is originally no distinction between Chinese and foreign. They can all be used. Moreover, Chinese medicines are rich in treasures, and new medicine has never completely rejected them and has even engaged in research, with many successful cases, such as ephedra and angelica. However, because domestic science is underdeveloped, these things are all done by foreigners, encroaching on others' territory. Now angelica is exported in large quantities every year, but I hear that Germany is already planting it. Perhaps in a few years, Chinese pharmacies will inevitably import German angelica that is fat and good. Old doctors must say that Chinese medicines must be used with the diagnosis of yin and yang, the five elements, and the six qi to be effective. That is what new doctors cannot admit. (And the criticism of new doctors is still based on how Western doctors were fifty years ago compared to current Western doctors. How can the two sides not argue?) In the future, our medicinal specialties will inevitably be plundered by foreigners, except for those "the meaning is in the physician" methods of decocting gold needles, which foreigners do not want.</p>
<p>The defense of old doctors still stands on the argument of preserving Chinese medicine. What about advocating national goods and plugging loopholes? These are all one-sided statements. If you check the customs records, you can know how much Western ginseng, cloves, borneol, and Western bezoar are imported each year and how much medicine new doctors use. Taking the entire city of Shanghai as an example, there is at least one Chinese pharmacy and one pawnshop at every bustling alley entrance, one showing the high sales of Chinese medicine and the other showing economic backwardness. As for researching Chinese medicine and improving medicinal production, it is originally the business of chemists, pharmacologists, and botanists. If you organize it according to the old method, you must also go to the drug-producing areas to work. It is definitely not scientific to install a row of "New Year's red lights" in front of a Chinese pharmacy and label it as "decocting medicine for customers."</p>
<p>Now that scientific talent is still lacking, it is very difficult to organize Chinese medicine. However, old doctors say, "We have already scientifically organized Chinese medicine." This excludes real science. Therefore, many quacks are established, insisting on putting electricity into ginseng gelatin to make some "electrified ginseng gelatin," creating an unprecedented joke.</p>
<p>The old ones are quite willing to innovate, and the new ones are inconvenient to restore the old. Therefore, people in society believe that the offense and defense are different, and public opinion inevitably leans toward the old. This is also human nature. However, unscrupulous people inevitably borrow the method of innovation to gain sympathy from society and implement their tricks of using both new and old methods. In fact, we know that the theories of new and old are still in a period of contention. It is definitely not a period when the techniques of new and old can be applied simultaneously. (After reading this article, perhaps you will fully understand the loud calls of new doctors.) Ten years ago, there were only two kinds of doctors in society: new and old. The old ones had their old theories and dared not falsely claim to know the new. The new ones dared not participate in the ancient. The two were clear and did their own thing. If each had its own records and each had its own statistics, perhaps a considerable right and wrong would emerge. If we do not compare it with countries around the world, we cannot say that China has no medicine and pharmaceuticals. In the past ten years, speculative "new and old integrations" have occurred. What is a stroke is called cerebral hemorrhage, and there are also "strokes in the meridians." Such theories are the great calamity of the people.</p>
<p>New medicine is based on science, and old medicine is based on metaphysics. Science requires thorough understanding, and metaphysics requires understanding that cannot be expressed in words. Modern physics and chemistry, and the yin and yang and five elements far from the I Ching, may not be able to come together for a while. I don't know how many centuries it will take to have an understanding. Therefore, it is okay for the National Medicine Museum to preserve the theories of old medicine as a kind of literature to be verified after a few centuries. To put it into practical use may not be in line with the trend. Furthermore, the research of metaphysics seems to be endless, and the end is right in front of us. (See figure for details) There is no procedure to follow. (But the purpose of running the National Medicine Museum now is different. It seems not to invite learned old doctors to organize existing records, but to shake the foundations of metaphysics and put on a scientific hat). The author has two friends. One is Mr. Wang Miaoda, who practices old medicine in Hangzhou. Presumably, old doctors admire him very much. One is his younger brother, Mr. Wang Weigen, who runs a hospital in Shaoxing. He is a new doctor who has returned from studying in Germany. Although they are brothers, they have never professed to communicate theories. However, Mr. Wang Weigen's theories can still educate others. As for Mr. Miaoda's skills, according to him, they can only be understood and cannot be expressed in words. This is a metaphor for the impracticality of metaphysics. It is also an example of learned scholars who are unwilling to force things. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e199">Promoting the Popularization of Knowledge of Pathological Anatomy <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>The state of human organs is different when they are healthy and when they are diseased. The internal panorama of a healthy person has already been recorded in human models and anatomical atlases, which can be found in all new-style bookstores. In addition, the physiology textbooks in secondary schools also record their outlines. Therefore, modern people can roughly understand the internal panorama of a normal healthy person (hereinafter referred to as "healthy person"). Therefore, various fallacies of the ancients, such as "the liver is on the left, the spleen is on the right," "the heart has seven orifices," and "the lungs have six lobes," can be slightly pointed out and understood, because they have already acquired this kind of common sense.</p>
<p>As for what the internal panorama of a sick person is like, bookstores have neither pathological atlases nor pathological models. Ordinary schools also do not have courses teaching pathology. There are no ordinary pathological textbooks to refer to. Members of society who want to know the internal panorama of a sick person have no way to glimpse its secrets. Therefore, the disease of stroke is clearly a change in the spinal cord and brain, but people in society still say that it is phlegm and heat. The disease of pulmonary tuberculosis is clearly a change in the lungs, but people in society still say that it is deficiency and evil. If the true nature of the disease is not clear, then the principles of recuperation and treatment will be uncertain, the will will not be firm, and even doctors and shamans will be employed together, and miscellaneous medicines will be thrown in randomly, resulting in loss of life and property, which is useless and harmful, and very pitiful.</p>
<p>Therefore, what I advocate is to take the internal changes of various important diseases and develop them into simple explanations, either publishing them in newspapers or compiling them into small pamphlets, distributing them to society, revealing the secrets of the disease nest, and revealing the truth of the abnormal state. Then the tripod of Yu will be in sight, and the monsters and demons will have nowhere to hide. Members of society can also understand where the nest of a certain disease is in which organ, and what kind of changes influence the occurrence of a certain symptom. Further, they can seek the layout of the nest and the type of abnormal state. Then the disease's ease or difficulty of treatment, as well as the treatment plan and recuperation method, can also be roughly grasped. That is, when a doctor treats a certain disease, wants to take what kind of method, and his explanation to the patient's family to seek the patient's family's understanding is also easier. In this way, the patient's family will not, until the time of total destitution when there is no way out, or will not be deceived by heresies, bewitched by external paths, and will not combine doctors and shamans, and the harm of throwing in miscellaneous medicines can also be slightly reduced. The lives and property of patients lost to the childish family's advocacy can also be slightly reduced.</p>
<p>Now, if we take the traditional knowledge of stroke symptoms of our country's ancients and verify them with pathological anatomy knowledge, we can correct their fallacies. The body of a person with stroke must have a bleeding disease nest in his brain when it is dissected, which can be observed. This has been verified in thousands of people and summarized in various countries in the East and West, and there is no error. Moreover, its</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>bleeding disease nest is in different locations, and the external symptoms that occur are also different. Those with eye deviation have a disease nest in the posterior lobe of the cerebrum. The ancients thought that it was in the liver. Those who cannot speak (motor aphasia) have a disease nest in the frontal lobe of the cerebrum. The ancients thought that it was in the heart. Those with slack lips have facial nerve paralysis. The disease nest may be in the lower part of the central 𢌞 gyrations of the cerebrum or in the knee of the internal capsule. The ancients thought that it was in the spleen. The ancients also considered constipation to be in the spleen. Those with constipation have paralysis of the rectum. This symptom belongs to the internal nerve. This symptom is not common in stroke and is not from the same source as slack lips. All are attributed to stroke in the spleen, which is even more incorrect. The ancients also considered nasal congestion to be in the lungs. There is no symptom of nasal congestion in stroke. It is just an empty statement to fill the number of the five viscera. Those who are deaf have hearing impairment. The disease nest is at the posterior end of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. The ancients thought that it was in the kidneys. This is the ancient theory of stroke in the five viscera, and its true pathological anatomical picture is like this. Thus, anatomy, physiology, and disease condition are consistent, and the ancient theory of disease symptoms, based on the traditional knowledge of the twelve meridians, can be organized. As for hemiplegia being called stroke, but arm paralysis being called numbness, in fact, those with hemiplegia have a disease nest in the internal capsule. Those with paraplegia in both limbs or one limb alone have a disease nest mostly in the cerebral cortex. Now it is called monoplegia. Thus, the confusion of names and realities can be understood. Therefore, if the knowledge of pathology can be popularized, not only can society increase its clarity of concepts about disease, but it will also be of great benefit to the organization of figures. Further, in our country's society that values corpses, the implementation of pathological anatomy may also gradually become popular.</p>
<h3 id="e200">The Ideal Doctor in My Eyes and the Ideal Doctor in the Eyes of the Masses <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>The ancients said, "The best doctor treats before illness. To treat after illness is the work of a lesser doctor." I won't talk about this "best doctor" for now. Because in today's world where public health is underdeveloped, there's no point in discussing treating before illness. Here, let me talk about the "ideal doctor" in terms of treatment. On the surface, the duty of us doctors seems to be simply to treat diseases. However, there should also be a grand goal in treating diseases. It's not enough to simply copy ancient prescriptions or privately admire established methods. Nor is it enough to simply imitate Zichan's saving people from the quagmire. Even less is it enough to imitate Zaiwo's rescuing people from a well. Because diseases are not limited to what the ancients knew, especially not limited to what the ancients could treat. They are also not limited to what I know or what I can treat. Besides the diseases known and treated by the ancients and me, they can occur and spread at any time, depending on the era, location, and environment. Even based on our current observations and experiments, there is a trend of unlimited increase. Isn't it very difficult to both understand and treat these increasing diseases? Therefore, the duty of a doctor is not only to be good at treating known diseases, but also to know and treat unknown diseases. It is not only to be able to treat both known and unknown diseases, but also to improve and invent methods to deal with both known and unknown diseases. Therefore, we must never cling to established rules and ancient methods and consider ourselves satisfied or fulfilled. Haven't I said before? The fundamental concepts of ancient doctors and modern doctors are completely different. Ancient doctors emphasized conservatism, while modern doctors emphasize progress. Ancient doctors only took established methods as dogma, while modern doctors often take established methods as a reference. Ancient doctors valued ideals and empty talk, deducing medical principles and matching them with symptoms. Modern doctors use scientific substances to eliminate pathogens and treat diseases. Therefore, their trends, directions, and business operations often run counter to each other. Of course, there is no possibility of consistent cooperation. Today's social disorder and occupational complexity can be said to have reached their peak. The levels of scholarship and the classes of knowledge are often separated by two or three thousand years. Therefore, it is inevitable that the minds of each person cannot be focused on one line. We, as doctors who inevitably bear the mark of the times, in this era, as people of this era, treating patients of this era, should use methods that are also in line with the modern era, and use medicines that are also relevant to the modern era. Because past medicines are already outdated, just like us doctors bearing the mark of the times, we will inevitably not fit into the future. Therefore, the doctors who can be called "ideal doctors" in our eyes today are roughly limited to the following levels. The first-rate ideal doctor is a person who can eradicate one or several major human enemies. The second-rate ideal doctor is a person who can improve ancient methods to treat known diseases and discover new methods to treat unknown diseases. The third-rate ideal doctor is a person who can happily use established methods to cope with diseases. As for those demons who know only half of what they should and treat the precious human body as a drug testing ground, they cannot be considered doctors. Of course, they cannot dream of the word "ideal." And even the word "mediocre" is still difficult to hope for. Because "mediocre" means ordinary, and "mediocre" also means not easily changing. The so-called mediocre and insignificant people neither benefit nor harm diseases. For the sake of maintaining their reputation, status, and livelihood, they simply prescribe a few lightly described decoctions. Although everyone praises them as famous doctors, they are actually mediocre doctors who live up to their name. They can never kill people, nor can they save people. In the end, they only mislead people. These are my views on what an ideal doctor is.</p>
<p>Now, let me say a few words about the "ideal doctor" in the eyes of the masses. Didn't I say earlier? In today's society, the levels of scholarship and the classes of knowledge are separated by two or three thousand years. Of course, it is extremely difficult for psychology to be consistent. As for how much? About one-thousandth is modern, ten-thousandths is near modern, twenty-thousandths is skeptical, and the rest are all ancient minds. (I dare not say that the distribution of medical knowledge is appropriate.) Therefore, people with ancient minds must be paired with ancient knowledge in order to be compatible. In our current society, most aspects of materials are new. Especially in terms of knowledge and medicine, most are old. Therefore, medicine from two thousand years ago is most in line with the psychology of our current society and most welcomed by the public in current society. And this belief is not the actual result, but a kind of illusion in knowledge and psychology. Therefore, the ideal doctor in the eyes of society must of course be pursued from this aspect. On the one hand, in addition to people in the modern knowledge class, plus the near-modern and skeptical parts, they are also inevitably affected by my faults. They will bury the facts of medicine in hearsay. Not to mention the public who have no ability to discern, they will fall into their trap. Even people with judgmental abilities often get confused and cannot tell right from wrong. There are also quite a few. So the two words "ideal doctor" are even more difficult to say. However, doctors who are keen on pursuing profits seize this good opportunity and go straight in. They know that the social custom of worshiping writing has not changed, so they take advantage of the opportunity to use their writing to attract patients. They also know the principle that no one can be an official without someone in the court, and no one can be a doctor without someone in the city. In addition to not offending the powerful families, they work hard to win over the wealthy and befriend the powerful. They use them to indirectly attract patients. They also know the greatness of the money demon and the moving nature of the name of charity, so they pretend to be charitable and make a small hole in their wallets to indirectly attract patients. These techniques are all medicine outside of medical skills. His attraction is extremely powerful. After a few years, he won a market like a city, and the praise never stopped. Therefore, the ideal doctor who takes the number of patients as a standard is an ideal doctor who is a kind of illusion in the knowledge and psychology of a group of people in society. It is not the ideal doctor in our eyes. It is the ideal doctor obtained from the results of medicine outside of medical skills. It is not the several kinds of academic ideal doctors that we mentioned above. Furthermore, the doctor that a group of people in society mistakenly believe to be an ideal doctor, the more patients he attracts, the lighter and more perfunctory his medical duties become. Because he is desperate to keep his job. He does not seek merit for diseases, but only seeks no fault. Therefore, his prescriptions only win everyone's praise for being stable. He will then escape the relationship of misleading people's lives. Furthermore, he has many patients, but his energy is limited. He needs to calculate the time and increase his income for medical treatment and prescriptions. Therefore, patients who have been waiting for a long time only need to get the doctor, touch his pulse, and prescribe his prescription to be satisfied. They don't even ask if the prescription is right or if the medicine is effective. There is also the general social psychology, if it is not the ideal doctor in their eyes, if they prescribe a prescription and take a medicine, there are still many criticisms and accusations. When it comes to their so-called ideal doctor, even if there is an error and they lose the lives of their family members, they not only do not have a single word of complaint, but also wholeheartedly defend them. They say that it was treated by a certain ideal doctor and it could not be cured. It's really called a fatal illness. There's no way. No one has even gone to study the patient's illness and the prescriptions they prescribed and the medicines they used! Alas! Do you think it's pathetic? But now, there are still many of these ideal doctors, and they are still constantly appearing. Is it a good phenomenon? Or a bad phenomenon? Let's wait until the majority of the public puts their brains in fast gear and catches up to two thousand years before we can start talking. Otherwise, we can only listen to the noisy cicadas in the dark and murky night.</p>
<h3 id="e201">On Treatment <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Yugong</p>
<p>The common mentality is that doctors rely solely on pulse diagnosis and prescriptions to treat diseases. If the disease is cured, the credit is attributed to the medicine. If it is not cured, the blame is attributed to the medicine. It is as if there is no other way to treat diseases besides medicine. When a doctor examines a patient, if he does not prescribe a prescription, it will cause misunderstandings among the patients. Some think that the doctor lacks sufficient knowledge, and others think that the disease is not easy to treat. All kinds of speculations are endless. Furthermore, they even have doubts about the entire medical community, so that the concept that Western medicine is good at surgery and short in internal medicine is deeply rooted in people's hearts. This is indeed a major obstacle to the promotion of new medicine.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many ways to treat diseases. The first thing to do is to make an accurate diagnosis, and then there should be reasonable treatment. The so-called reasonable treatment is to apply the methods that scientists have researched and applied to treat the disease. At first, it is not limited to medicine. Let's cite a few examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>(1) Rest Therapy: When a person is unfortunately ill, the first thing to pay attention to is to maintain physical strength and not waste it at all in order to increase resistance, drive away the disease, and restore health. The principle is very obvious. Those who suffer from typhoid fever or pneumonia must lie down extremely quietly until the body temperature returns to normal for ten days before they can get out of bed. Those who suffer from influenza should also lie down quietly for at least two days. Those who suffer from tuberculosis, if they have chills and fever, should absolutely rest quietly in bed. Wait until the fever subsides, two or three weeks before they can get out of bed. When the fever recurs, they must lie down quietly again. This kind of rest treatment is amazingly effective. But the common mentality is that being sick in bed is not a good sign. Therefore, even if they have chills and fever, they still force themselves to sit up. Until not only the original symptoms are not relieved, but also complications occur one after another. Being ignorant of the early signs, they often fall into incurable situations. The importance of this rest treatment cannot but be paid attention to.</p>
<p>(2) Dietary Treatment: Dietary treatment is very important in various diseases. For example, in the treatment of diabetes, the daily diet must be carefully weighed, properly controlled, and qualitatively regular. It should be determined according to the patient's daily situation. The amount of "carbohydrates" and "proteins" given is based on the premise that the urine does not contain sugar, and the amount of "fat" must ensure that the patient does not have ketoacidosis. Those who suffer from acute nephritis must be given a light diet and avoid foods containing "protein." Those who suffer from beriberi, the main treatment is to correct the lack of "vitamins" in their food. Those who suffer from rickets must have "vitamin A" in their food. As for other diseases, there are those who use liquid food, gruel food, nourishing food, or solid food, which vary according to the disease. If someone suffers from acute gastritis, they often do not allow food except water for a long time in order to give the gastric mucosa a proper rest. This dietary treatment cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>(3) Cold or Heat Treatment: The application of external cold or heat also has a very important impact on the disease. For example, those who suffer from acute nephritis often use hot wet cloths to wrap the body to make the patient sweat, so that the toxins in the body that cannot be excreted through the urinary tract can be excreted through sweat. Those who suffer from typhoid fever or pneumonia, place ice on the forehead. Those who suffer from laryngitis, place it on the neck. Those who suffer from gastric ulcers and bleeding, place it on the upper part of the abdomen, and those who suffer from heatstroke even need to immerse the whole body in ice water and then wipe it with a damp towel until the body temperature drops to 101 degrees. The application of cold and heat varies according to the disease. Not only does it reduce the symptoms, but it also has the effect of saving lives. How can we ignore it? (4) Surgical Treatment: Surgical treatment methods vary. Everyone knows about surgery and injections. However, surgery is not limited to knives and injections. There are artificial respiration surgery, bloodletting surgery, and blood transfusion surgery. Artificial respiration is widely used. For example, in cases of gas poisoning, morphine poisoning, anesthetic poisoning, and carbon monoxide poisoning, it can often bring the dead back to life. Bloodletting surgery is used for acute heart failure. It can reduce the expansion of capillaries in the lungs. Blood transfusion surgery can be used for excessive bleeding, carbon monoxide poisoning, and chronic anemia. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e202">Using Traditional Chinese Medicine with a Western Approach <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese medicine has theories about cold, heat, warmth, coolness, rising, lowering, floating, and sinking. These all come from conforming to fallacies such as yin and yang and the five elements. However, the effect of treating diseases cannot be denied. For example, Pinellia ternata suppresses vomiting, Ephedra sinica induces sweating, apricot kernels treat coughs, and rhubarb induces diarrhea. These are all real achievements. As for how they can suppress vomiting, induce sweating, treat coughs, and induce diarrhea, they are all unknown. This is knowing that it is so, but not knowing why it is so. Now, if we want to know why it is so, we must use scientific sorting and research. For example, use botany to recognize its genus, use pharmacognosy to identify its quality, use chemistry to analyze its properties, use pharmacology to test its efficacy, and make a systematic report. Doctors then use it in clinical practice. In this way, not only can the original efficacy be verified, but new effects are often discovered. However, this sorting and research work cannot be done without sufficient funding and new medical talents who are familiar with research, and it takes a considerable amount of time. It is not like a crudely made, nonsensical mixed medicine, conforming to a little medical knowledge that is still under research and discussion, and using advertising techniques like telling fairy tales to tell the public: "This is a special medicine for a certain disease." This is a new medicine that has been scientifically improved. It is like the medicines sold on the market recently that are not produced by pharmacists, deceiving themselves and others. It is truly a pest in the scientific community and a scourge in the medical community. Now, in order to provide something for drug manufacturers to follow and something for drug users to have a standard, I will excerpt here traditional Chinese medicines that have been sorted and researched, whose properties have been clearly understood, and whose effects have been verified, all of which have been achieved through academic theory and have been included in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China. This may increase the general public's medical common sense, so that they can make choices when consulting doctors and purchasing medicines. However, there may be something wrong with what I say. I hope that my medical colleagues can come forward and teach me. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e203">On the Government's Urgent Need to Help the Cotton Industry <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Ouchu</p>
<p>The cotton industry is China's largest industry. The capital of Chinese-owned factories alone is as high as 150 million yuan. It employs hundreds of thousands of workers. The number of merchants engaged in the transportation of cotton yarn and cloth is even greater. It is also the most powerful tool to resist foreign goods. The import of foreign goods into China is mainly cotton goods. If China's cotton production increases by one part, the import of foreign goods can be reduced by one part. Since the government changed the unified tax on cotton yarn, the annual fiscal revenue should be more than 20 million yuan. The importance of China's cotton industry in the national economy and national finance should be valued by the people.</p>
<p>Since the cotton industry is as important as described above in relation to the national economy and national finance, the prosperity or decline of the cotton industry is not only a matter of interest to the cotton industry itself. The national finance and the national economy are also affected. I have been serving the cotton industry for nearly 20 years. I not only feel the great responsibility, but also have to fully expose the various weaknesses of the cotton industry in order to ask the government and the people to pay attention. Because the cotton industry is under heavy pressure from international competition, all kinds of weaknesses have been followed for a long time and are difficult to reverse. Without government assistance, the cotton industry itself cannot solve them. Now, based on my experience, I will list the various weaknesses of the cotton industry as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Insufficient raw cotton: China's cotton exports have always been one of the major native products. In recent years, with the increasing number of yarn factories, the demand for raw cotton has increased day by day. The output of domestic cotton is not enough to supply the needs of the factories, so American cotton and Indian cotton have been imported in large quantities. In 1930, the total import of foreign cotton reached 170 million customs taels, equivalent to more than 260 million yuan in national currency. In 1931, the total import of foreign cotton was also 130 million customs taels, equivalent to more than 200 million yuan in national currency. This is one of the shortcomings of China's cotton industry.</p>
<p>(2) Poor cotton quality: Not only is China's cotton production too small, but most of it is of poor quality and is not suitable for spinning fine yarn. In recent years, although good American varieties have been imported as much as possible, because Chinese cotton farmers lack knowledge and do not know how to select good varieties, the original American varieties with longer fibers have gradually degraded and become coarse after several years. As a result, those who spin fine yarn and double-strand thread still have to use American cotton as raw material. Therefore, there are many who have failed due to the high exchange rate of foreign countries. This is the second shortcoming of China's cotton industry.</p>
<p>(3) Deep-rooted Malpractices: China's cotton market has no fixed standards. Those who sell cotton often mix inferior cotton with good cotton. What's more, they add moisture and water to increase the weight and seek improper benefits. Watered cotton often rots in early summer, causing the yarn factory to suffer a lot of invisible losses. This is the third shortcoming of China's cotton industry.</p>
<p>(4) Cotton Theft and Leakage: Cotton in the interior of China is transported to major trading ports. The distant ones are thousands of miles away, and the nearby ones are also hundreds of miles away. The theft and loss along the way are also huge. Loose packages are common. Even machine-packed, so-called foreign frames, also have theft and leakage. This increases the cost of cotton. This is the fourth shortcoming of China's cotton industry.</p>
<p>(5) Immature Textile Technology: China's cotton textile industry is relatively late compared with other countries. In recent years, there has been progress in technology compared with the past. However, compared with Japanese-owned factories, it is still inferior. This is the fifth shortcoming of China's cotton industry.</p>
<p>(6) Difficult to Manage Workers: Because Chinese workers lack knowledge, their original work ability is not as good as others. In addition, in recent years, trends have led to disputes. There are even those who do not work but specialize in inciting trends as a skill. Factories are almost at a loss for management difficulties. This is the sixth shortcoming of China's cotton industry.</p>
<p>(7) Weak Work Ability: Chinese yarn factories employ far more workers than Japanese-owned factories. Japanese yarn factories use about 240 workers per 10,000 spindles for spinning 20-count yarn. Chinese yarn factories use at least 350 workers per 10,000 spindles for spinning 20-count yarn, and as many as 750 workers. Because there are no labor unions in Japanese factories, workers are trained and have higher skills, while Chinese factories are not. This is the seventh shortcoming of China's cotton industry.</p>
<p>(8) Lower Production Volume: According to a survey in 1925, the average output per spindle of 20-count yarn in Japanese factories was 0.434 pounds per ten hours. If calculated according to 24 hours a day, the output of 20-count yarn per spindle is more than one pound. At the same time, the average output per spindle of 20-count yarn in Chinese factories is about 0.7 pounds per 24 hours, which is one-third less. This is the eighth shortcoming of China's cotton industry.</p>
<p>(9) Higher Labor Costs: Because of the above reasons, the labor costs of Chinese factories are higher than those of Japanese factories. Therefore, even if Japanese factories sell at a slightly lower price, they can still make a profit. Moreover, in normal times, the yarn from Japanese factories is of better quality, and the selling price is often higher than the yarn from Chinese factories. Under the same conditions, it is difficult for Chinese factories to compete with Japanese factories. This is the ninth shortcoming of China's cotton industry.</p>
<p>Based on raw materials, technology, and labor costs, it is already difficult for China's cotton industry to compete with Japanese factories. However, China's cotton industry still has other shortcomings in finance, transportation, and other aspects.</p>
<p>(1) Lack of Public Reserves: Japanese-owned factories in China are all branch factories. Their annual operating profits have huge public reserves. In total, all public reserves are more than one times the capital. Therefore, they are deeply rooted. Most Chinese-owned factories have no public reserves, or even if they do, the amount is not huge.</p>
<p>(2) Weak Capital: Chinese-owned factories often have businesses that are larger than their capital. Financial turnover is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>(3) Excessive Interest Rates: Because of the lack of working capital, they have to borrow from banks and money shops. The monthly interest rate is often more than one percent, and some are as high as 1.4 or 5 percent per month. It is really unbearable.</p>
<p>(4) Slow Transportation: Japanese merchants have special agreements with Japanese shipping companies for transporting American and Indian cotton, giving priority to loading. Even when selling yarn and cloth in various parts of China, Japanese commercial ships will load them as quickly as possible. Chinese-owned factories not only have no foreign shipping industry, but also have many obstacles in domestic transportation. They are far inferior to Japanese merchants in transportation.</p>
<p>(5) Heavy Taxes: Japanese merchants' purchase of cotton and sale of yarn are protected by treaties. After one tax, they can travel throughout the country. However, Chinese-owned factories cannot enjoy this benefit. The excessive taxes in the interior of the country still exist. (6) Inland Yarn Factories are at the Mercy of Others: In major trading ports, there are many factories, and many of them are established by foreign merchants. There are more accidents. As for the factories in the interior, because of inconvenient transportation and lack of information, they often suffer unexpected damage and cannot appeal.</p>
<p>(7) Yarn Factory Authorities Have Short-sighted Vision and Cannot Consolidate Groups: Japan's cotton textile industry has a strong group. They use their full power to oppress China's cotton industry and attack China's cotton industry. They want to monopolize the Chinese market with Japan's cotton industry. For several years, they have been making progress. The import of Japanese cotton goods into China has accounted for the first place of China's imported goods. Japanese-owned factories in China are in a superior position compared to Chinese-owned factories. However, the authorities of Chinese factories still cannot consolidate groups to resist foreign aggression. This is also one of the major reasons why Chinese cotton cannot be developed.</p>
<p>The cotton industry is in a very important position for the national economy and national finance. However, its own shortcomings are as described above. For the present plan, we cannot but hope that the government will actively help. The two most important things are:</p>
<p>(1) Increase Import Tariffs on Cotton Goods: Japan is the largest importer of cotton goods in China. Because of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Mutual Benefit Agreement in 1930, we cannot freely increase taxes. However, the agreement will expire on May 6, 1933, which is less than five months away. We sincerely hope that the government will pay attention to this as soon as possible and prepare in advance. Once the agreement expires, we will announce the specific measures to increase taxes on imported cotton goods to protect the domestic cotton industry.</p>
<p>(2) Actively Plan the Entire Plan for the Development of the Cotton Industry: China's cotton industry has shortcomings in various aspects. We must plan and establish an entire plan for the active development of the cotton industry. At the same time, we must comply and cannot solve the problems in a piecemeal way. If the government has the determination to actively develop the cotton industry, it will not worry about having no way. I am not talented, and I will continue to submit my opinions to the government.</p>
<h3 id="e204">A Brief Discussion of Modern Currency (Part 2) <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Ke</p>
<p>Chapter 2: The Standard of Currency</p>
<p>After long-term experience, the ancients realized that metal was the best material for making coins. Therefore, they specialized in using metal for currency. Other types of auxiliary currencies were gradually eliminated, and metal currency became the only popular one because: ㈠ Metal rotates extremely easily, and its handling is more convenient than any other material; ㈡ It is extremely durable and its quality does not deteriorate over time. Even after repeated use, its consumption is minimal; ㈢ If it is only regarded as a commodity, it has great uses in the manufacturing industry, so everyone is happy to obtain it; ㈣ It has luster and brilliance, and can be used as ornaments, which increases its value; ㈤ It is easy to split, and can be made into units of any size for use; Finally, the quantity of metal is relatively small, but not too small. Compared with daily necessities, its scarcity gives it a higher value, but it is still sufficient to meet all social needs. In short, metal possesses the six qualities of a good currency, so it is suitable to be adopted as the raw material for currency.</p>
<p>These six standards are still the criteria for selecting currency materials in today's laws, but in ancient times, some aspects were particularly important. First, gold, silver, and copper were scarce in ancient times, so their prices were higher. Second, these soft metals could be easily cast with relatively crude tools. In addition, gold and silver had a sacred quality in the minds of ancient people. These two materials were the most exquisite substances known to ancient people, so they were often offered to the gods they worshiped, and used to decorate their temples and Buddha statues. After this, people gradually regarded gold and silver as sacred, and their value became even higher.</p>
<p>Therefore, gold, silver, and copper were mostly used as currency to replace all other media of exchange among more advanced nations. However, at one time, iron was also used as currency and was popular everywhere, but it was soon eliminated. As the quantity of iron increased, its price dropped. If iron was used as currency, a large amount was required, which was cumbersome and difficult to use, so it was eventually abandoned and replaced by other more convenient materials. There are many examples of using iron as currency in history. For example, Lycurgus of Sparta decreed that iron should be the legal currency. He did this because he did not want the people of Sparta to become a commercialized people and forget their warrior spirit. Iron is very heavy, so using it as currency could reduce the people's desire to accumulate iron coins, and commerce could reduce its power to attract people to engage in it, so that the people of Sparta could concentrate on military training to create a strong military nation.</p>
<p>Copper also gradually lost its position as a copper coin. Today, it is often used as a subsidiary coin to pay for very small amounts only.</p>
<p>As the quality of currency gradually trended towards gold and silver, advanced countries also moved towards the standardization of currency. The expansion of trade made its scope, quantity, and procedures increasingly broad and complex, so it was necessary to have currency with fixed weight and price to facilitate its progress. The first things that moved in this direction and became fixed currencies seemed to be ornaments. The purpose of ancient ornaments was to decorate the body to enhance beauty, but sometimes they were also used as currency. For example, the Bible records the use of ornaments as currency. Genesis describes how Rebekah offered water to Abraham's servant and his camels, and the servant rewarded her with an earring weighing half a shekel and bracelets weighing ten shekels. This clearly shows that ornaments were also used as currency.</p>
<p>The transition from standardized ornaments to fixed coinage was just a matter of a hair's breadth. What is called coinage is nothing more than a fixed weight of metal containing a fixed amount of pure ingredients, with its reliability certified and imprinted by a group or a powerful person to form a fixed form of use. This certification can be done by a group of metallurgists, a group of merchants, or one or two emperors. The earliest use of coins came from Egypt and Lydia, with the latter being earlier.</p>
<p>The earliest coins were cast from a combination of gold and silver. This combination was called Electrum. The reason why these two metals were combined to make coins was not intentional by the coiners, but out of necessity. The ores of gold and silver were often mixed together, and there were no good metallurgists to separate them at that time, so they were used as they were, and this combined coin was formed.</p>
<p>The color of coins cast from gold and silver was not very pleasing, so as people's metallurgical knowledge improved, they analyzed and smelted them, and cast coins separately, while also slightly adding other base metals to increase their hardness and color.</p>
<p>After coins became popular, trade became much more convenient, because the value of coins was fixed, and their counting was very easy, unlike gold nuggets or other things that had to be tested, measured, and divided for use.</p>
<p>The use of coins is not without its drawbacks. There are many dangers involved. Counterfeiting and private minting have existed since ancient times. Even official coiners often eroded the weight and composition of coins for personal gain. Cunning people might scrape or chisel coins to extract scattered gold for profit, or use acid to extract residue from coins to enrich themselves, or rub new coins together to collect the shavings for use. Problems like these have occurred since the advent of coins, and are especially serious today. Every country has extremely strict laws to punish counterfeiters and destroyers of coins, and every country spends huge amounts of money every year to ensure the composition and weight of its currency. If this is not done, a large number of bad coins will drive all the good coins out of circulation. But in fact, this situation still often occurs. Although the prohibitions are strict, there are still many violators, and the government can do nothing about it.</p>
<p>The reason why bad coins drive out good coins is very simple. People always like to hoard coins with full value, and let inferior coins circulate in the market. The same is true for bankers and merchants. They must transport coins to foreign countries to pay various debts. The recipients in foreign countries will only accept these coins after they have been examined. Therefore, for the sake of credit and convenience, they must also collect good coins and transport them to foreign countries. The combination of the two makes the number of good coins circulating on the market decrease and the number of bad coins increase. Therefore, the general public, seeing the abundance of bad coins and fearing their unreliability, also compete to hoard good coins, and the amount of good coins in circulation decreases day by day.</p>
<p>The first person to notice this phenomenon and pay attention to it was Sir Thomas Gresham of England. Gresham was a famous English banker and merchant. Seeing this situation, he pointed it out to the public and explained its advantages and disadvantages, so the rule that bad coins drive out good coins is called Gresham's Law. This law is not only applicable in the Middle Ages, but is still useful today. However, the inferior coins in the meantime are not only coins that have been scraped or have insufficient composition.</p>
<p>The practice of combining two metals to make one coin is called Symmetallism. This term is often encountered in the writings of various economists, but its meaning is not very important, because the practice of combining coins has long been eliminated.</p>
<p>In countries with higher culture, gold and silver are often cast into two kinds of coins and used together as legal tender. This situation is called Bimetallism. The bimetallic standard has been a fiercely debated topic since the beginning of economics, and has also caused great political disputes in various countries, even today. There are countless writings on this system, and all kinds of prejudices and sophistry are attached to it. Those who hate it denounce it as the source of all economic evils, while those who like it see it as the most flexible system that can adapt to the needs of the times and places. The rights and wrongs are confusing, so it is no wonder that the general public always regards it as something they cannot understand.</p>
<p>However, is the bimetallic standard really something that people cannot understand? A little investigation will show that this is not the case. The system is not difficult to understand, but it is difficult to implement. A country that adopts the bimetallic standard uses both gold and silver as legal tender. People can pay debts and taxes with either one, and the two can be used interchangeably. A person who owes gold can repay it with silver, and a person who owes silver can repay it with gold. The creditor cannot refuse to accept it simply because it is a different kind.</p>
<p>The implementation of the bimetallic standard is regulated by law. The government designates mints, treasuries, or central banks. Anyone who wants to sell gold must be purchased with a corresponding amount of coins, and it must be guaranteed that this amount of pure gold will be sold at this price at any time. At the same time, they have the same responsibility for pure silver. Anyone who wants to sell pure silver must be purchased at a certain price, and it must be guaranteed that pure silver will be sold at the same price at any time. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e205">The Atmosphere of the Financial Silver Market is Dull <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the banking sector was closed for the usual Sunday holiday, and the atmosphere in the money market was sluggish. As a result, no one competed for the premium, and the result was the same price as the previous day, at seven mace, one candareen, and four li. There was no slight difference between the morning and afternoon markets. The silver exchange was over-collateralized, and the banks did not accept remittances, resulting in an unusually large amount of slippage. Both markets generally made blank loans, with the number of exchange drafts made in the morning market being 260,000 and in the afternoon market being 85,000. Only 10,000 banknotes were traded in the morning market, and there was no news of any off-market banknotes. The exchange bill transactions were also impossible to calculate due to the blank silver exchange loans. Money shops received over 5.4 million in silver dollars, and silver shops received over 21 million in silver dollars. Suspicious remittances from all routes received over 400,000, and outward remittances from customers only amounted to 40,000 to 50,000 inland. Transactions in small money shops amounted to over 600,000. In the morning market, the auxiliary currency, Jiangnan small dollars, was priced at six mace, two candareens, four li, and a half, which was two and a half li lower than the previous afternoon. The price in the afternoon market did not change due to lack of transactions. 3,000 jiao were traded in the morning market. In the morning market, Guangdong small dollars were priced at six mace, two candareens, two li, six hao, and two and a half. In the afternoon market, they were priced at six mace, two candareens, and two and a half li. As a result, the two markets were better by eight hundred seventy-five. 35,000 jiao were traded in the morning market and 65,000 jiao were traded in the afternoon market. Copper coins were slightly short at 300 wen, for a total of 395,700 wen, with over 39,100 strings traded, totaling 9,900 taels of silver.</p>

<p>A telegram from New York on December 10th reported on the cotton market conditions for the week, stating that progress had been made in continuing to pay war debts, but there was no certainty about domestic rural relief programs. This week, raw cotton transactions were restricted, there were not many sellers, short positions were covered, and there was some demand from the same industry, but there were no large sales in the South. The reason for this was mostly due to a vague hope that rural relief programs might cause cotton prices to rise. Due to these factors, cotton prices rebounded, but the cotton market showed signs of a looser position in the future compared to before. France's failure to pay its debt may have triggered some selling pressure, but at the same time, there was a clear hope that a re-examination of the entire war debt issue could have a revitalizing impact on world commerce. The House Agriculture Committee is currently hearing debates on rural relief war debt programs that have automatic domestic allocation plans. The experimental measures contained in this bill are currently subject to criticism, but Congress believes that, in any case, a rural relief program is essential.</p>

<p>The Yarn Market Turns Weak</p>
<p>(15th) Tianjin News: The situation of Xihe cotton was difficult to see active sales at first, but the situation was volatile and there was no turning point. Western merchant Fojia Foreign Firm bought 300 bales, opening at 23 taels and 4 qian. Other foreign firms traded 1,200 bales, with prices also quoted at 23 taels and 4 qian to 23 taels and 2 qian. Cotton yarn transactions tended to be solemn and the momentum tended to weaken. Xianghe Gang bought 112 taels of 10-count Sanguang yarn (cash).</p>

<p>丨The Shanghai-Hankou Combination is 53 Taels and There are Still No Goods to Search For丨</p>
<p>Recently, the Hunan lotus seeds have seen brisk sales to the civilian gang, and the inventory in the market has gradually become scarce. Yesterday, the market suddenly rose by two or three taels. According to investigations, there are only a few hundred boxes of Hengzhou lotus seeds in this area. Yesterday, the passenger goods opened at 50 taels, which was exceptionally brisk. The inventory of Jiuxi lotus seeds is scarce, and they are sold at 52 taels. Changde and Xiangtan goods are reported to be out of stock, and Raozhou lotus seeds are priced at 50 taels. Until the afternoon, a telegram from Hankou stated that Hengzhou lotus seeds had soared to 31 taels and 4 qian per dan, and the Shanghai offer had to be combined with 53 taels, but there were still no goods to search for. If this is the case, the Shanghai market will continue to rise. It is bound to follow, because according to the land price, it is also higher than the Shanghai market by three taels.</p>

<p>The Benyu Hankou market was very weak. In the Baijiang and Shaoxing area, due to the excessive short selling by the oil presses, and the settlement date has arrived, the supply is less than the demand. Therefore, they went to Jiaxing area to buy the oil of this car. The spot goods were suddenly tense due to squeezing, and the price soared to more than 23 yuan per dan. Yesterday, a telegram came from Lanxi, saying that spot goods were pouring in, and the price fell by one yuan, and the subsequent trend is still expected to continue to fall, because the rise in the Zhejiang road this time was not a normal market, but was caused by squeezing the spot. Now that spot goods are pouring in from various places, the market can of course return to its original state. The market in this port has always relied on the Hankou market, so the rise and fall of the Zhejiang road can be ignored. However, the Hankou market has aroused buying interest after the sharp decline, and it seems to be slightly active recently, not as silent as it was half a month ago. There are also many Western oil and Taihe oil arriving in this city, and the passenger market has opened at 16 taels per dan. According to a telegram from New York, tung oil prices fluctuated, with a price of 4.25 to 4.375 cents per pound.</p>

<p>The Price of Bamboo Steel Rebar Falls by 15 Shillings. 5,000 to 6,000 Boxes of Tinplate Arrived Yesterday.</p>
<p>(24 White Iron Tiles) Recently, spot goods have suddenly become scarce, because the accumulated inventory is weak and not many goods have arrived, so people are in good spirits and buyers are rising. The standard has suddenly improved by five qian and is sold at 11 taels. The Ministry of Railways previously handled 2,000 dan, which made the inventory even thinner, and the market is expected to rise. The market conditions for Number 28 and Number 26 are stable, and the prices have not changed.</p>
<p>(Bamboo Steel Rebar) Yesterday, a private telegram from London stated that the price of bamboo steel rebar has fallen by 15 shillings compared to before, which is 5 pounds per ton. The market in this port is very shadowy.</p>
<p>(Tinplate) The tinplate in the dry market arrived yesterday at the new Taikoo Warehouse with five or six rows of boxes, and the market slightly rebounded to an estimated 11 taels and 5 jiao for 90 pounds, 12 taels and 5 qian for 100 pounds, and 24 taels for 200 pounds.</p>

<p>Rayon sales are still not lonely. The foreign exchange rate is stable.

<p>The dry cocoon market in this port previously saw no one paying attention due to the thick inventory of old factory silk, and the cocoon price dropped. The net cocoon cost only 400 taels. Because the Chinese silk spring sales in the US market were launched, the Shanghai hoarding households (such as Gan De Lan Le and Qia He, etc.) took the opportunity to throw in and purchase, causing the price to rise sharply. Now the factory Chen cocoon and other factories are clearing Xian silk and starting to replenish raw materials to maintain work. Cocoon sales are gradually becoming active. In the past two days, more than 800 dan of autumn dry cocoons were traded. The Wuxi top body goods were 480 jin, and the price per dan was 95 taels or 6 taels. The net cocoon cost must be 500 taels and the prospect is 30 taels.</p>

<h3 id="e220">On a Riverboat (3) <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Serving the Buddha</p>
<p>"Something strange has happened on the boat; please come with me to investigate." "Have you lost something?" the uniformed officer asked.</p>
<p>"No; I fear something involving a life. I'm confident my judgment is correct. Please come and take a look with me."</p>
<p>The officer stood up in surprise, looking at the old man doubtfully. The old man continued:</p>
<p>"Please call for a few more people, preferably with handguns or something similar. This matter won't be easy to handle." The officer dared not decide on his own and went to see the captain, recounting the matter. The captain didn't quite believe it and questioned the old man carefully. The old man didn't answer much, only saying, "Hurry up, the boat is about to reach the dock, you will be responsible for this."</p>
<p>The captain had no choice but to follow the old man's instructions, summoning several crew members to follow him, and handing a handgun to the officer.</p>
<p>The old man arrived at the cabin, pushed the door open and went inside. The middle-aged man was calmly packing his luggage. Seeing several uniformed men behind the old man, his face immediately turned pale. The old man pointed at him and said to the sailors:</p>
<p>"Keep an eye on this man first!" Several sailors surged forward from left and right.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man was very cunning, not resisting, only asking them sternly: "What's going on!" The old man stared at him, saying:</p>
<p>"Friend, you should tell the truth. Where has that young man gone? We've come to you to find him!"</p>
<p>"How would I know? He just went up there," the middle-aged man continued to quibble.</p>
<p>The old man seemed very confident, directing the sailors to search the cabin, under the bed, in the slightly larger boxes, searching all suspicious places, but the young man was still nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>The old man pondered, examining the room, but there was no place large enough to hide a corpse. But suddenly, the old man caught sight of a neatly packed bedding roll on the luggage rack above the bed. He walked over and sniffed it, and a revolting, strange fragrance emanated from it. The old man understood. He hurriedly retreated to the doorway, triumphantly ordering the sailors to open the bedding roll, but he quickly turned his head away.</p>
<p>Hearing the old man's last words, the middle-aged man immediately convulsed, his legs giving way.</p>
<p>I imagine no one wants to see what's in that bedding roll? The outside is a burlap cover, wrapped in a blanket, and inside the blanket is a neatly laid out sheet of oil paper. But inside the oil paper, is a mud of flesh and blood... The old man's suspicion was correct, the young man was indeed still quietly lying in that room.</p>
<p>Why did the old man smell a strange fragrance from the bedding roll? I don't believe there could be such a cruelly meticulous murderer in this world, even in our cruel feudal society.</p>
<h3 id="e221">"Let Us All Weep Together" <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Xingzi</p>
<p>It wasn't by chance that I passed by the New World. Earth-shattering gongs and drums were ringing inside, and outside the door were colorful arches made of pine and cypress. I thought, today isn't Christmas, but, immediately, my thoughts turned back, knowing that this was related to the large advertisement in the newspaper saying "Let Us All Weep Together." Touching my heart, although it seemed a little sour, but, weeping, I couldn't manage a quick tear. I steeled myself and slipped through the crowd of "devout men and women" who had "come to weep together."</p>
<p>However, this slip made the sourness in my heart grow heavier. I slipped to the Sincere Company, and looking back, I even felt a little regret! I cursed myself for being a fool, but God is above, I certainly didn't curse myself for being a "cold-blooded animal."</p>
<p>I thought, this must be so lively! In this clamor of gongs and drums, there are "flowers," there are "stars," there are songs, there are dances, there are "patriotic" tears, there are "compassionate" tears, there are "tearful" smiles...</p>
<p>I thought, this must be so meaningful! Saving the country, saving people, and cultivating blessings, accumulating good deeds, and truly opening up a "heart of concern for the country!" Achieving five things with one action...</p>
<p>I also thought: this must be so romantic and delicate! After saving the country, in the spare time of saving people, "My 'flower,' come here," and present a beautiful floral crown! "My 'star,' come here" and dance a schottische, fragrant flesh, fragrant powder...</p>
<p>Thinking so much, I counted on my fingers: it's lively, it's meaningful, and it's romantic and delicate. Immediately, it felt like ants were crawling on my heart, itchy.</p>
<p>Until this moment, I was still regretting. I hated my tears for not rising to the occasion, I cursed myself for being a fool. But, God is above, I certainly didn't curse myself for being a "cold-blooded animal!"</p>

<p>— Ms. Ziju</p>
<p>Dear Sisters:</p>
<p>You are swimming in sweet dreams, aren't you? Ideal futures are turning over in your minds, aren't they? But, time is dying away second by second, and real life will be revealed one scene after another in your life's history. When you discover that reality is far from ideal, you will be alarmed, annoyed, saddened, and grieved.</p>
<p>We can have idealized dreams forever, but at the same time, we have to welcome the arrival of real life. Reality is ordinary; no one can leave this ordinary life. Marriage is the first step from idealized dreams into real life. Before you embark on this stage, you must be prepared. First, I have to ask if you already have a lover? If you already have one, then you will take a further step to get married: but you must be prudent, are your partner's interests and habits the same as yours? This is the most important thing. When I say interests and habits, I generally mean daily life and academic research. Otherwise, if you are temporarily blinded by passion and unite, after the start of communal life, you will gradually drift in opposite directions. You want to go west, he wants to go east. In this China that still respects virginity, it's best not to divorce unless absolutely necessary, so you must be cautious from the beginning.</p>
<p>Second, the question of your two ages. Women age more easily. Men's sexual lives can extend to sixty or seventy, while women's end as early as forty or as late as fifty-three or four. Therefore, your partner must be older than you. It is of course not appropriate for a young woman to marry an old man, and it is even more inappropriate for an older sister to marry a younger brother. It is best if you are seven or eight years younger than him. Cohabitation is of course not entirely dependent on sex for its maintenance, but at least it occupies a chair in the entire life. In addition, if you are very strong and healthy, do not marry a sickly husband; if you are weak and sickly, it is best not to marry a fat and healthy person.</p>
<p>Third, in your passionate love, do not lose your rational judgment: A. You must not get married before you complete your studies. B. Love is best developed gradually, with more contact with each other, mutual recognition, and mutual understanding. It is better to become a couple from many years of friendship than to have a sudden, quick, love-at-first-sight union. C. You must consult with your close friends or parents and solicit their opinions. Those involved are confused, those watching are clear. They will definitely give you good advice.</p>
<p>Fourth, before you get married, you must ask yourself, do you have common sense about sexual life? Marriage is the beginning of sexual life. This is not a shameful or mysterious thing. You must study it early, at least read a book about sexual hygiene or sexual life. Many virgins, due to lack of this common sense, never get satisfactory pleasure and diseases follow. Isn't this very painful?</p>
<p>Fifth, it is naturally not permissible to embrace the supremacy of love, to sacrifice everything for love, until you have no self, no career, no standpoint, and become someone else's person; but if you are determined to play with the opposite sex, to provide for your sensory pleasure and satisfaction, playing with people often equals playing with yourself, especially in a male-centered society. You should shift your free time and the cleverness and talent to play with people to academic research and enthusiastic career development. This is the real new woman. The above are a few random thoughts. I don't know what the sisters think? I will discuss them with you another day.</p>

<p>— Weihan</p>
<p>The aborigines' concept of God is also very interesting. Generally speaking, God is an eternally immortal and extremely lofty being, who usually lives in the sky. He has a very large human posture, red skin, long hair that falls to his shoulders, and feet like those of an emu. (The emu is a giant bird native to Australia, resembling an ostrich.) Some gods even have feet like dogs and have many wives. The nature of God is very kind; they only govern the heavens, but do not interfere with earthly affairs. They do not create people, nor do they care about human affairs. However, legend says that they are very happy to take the souls of good people to heaven, and the aborigines firmly believe this. This concept of God varies from tribe to tribe. This is just a general concept.</p>

<p>Two Red Lilies</p>
<p>There was a time when I was very obsessed with the works of Anatole France. I loved his gorgeous rhetoric, esoteric views, and the rich, pure scholarly atmosphere that permeated every book.</p>
<p>During such a time, on a sunny winter morning, holding his extravagant "Red Lily," I sat side by side with Lü on a park bench. The azure sky bathed in the warm sunlight, and I unknowingly betrayed my Anatole France. Although I held it in my hand, I treated his elaborate masterpiece as black decorations on white paper, not seeing a single word.</p>
<p>Looking at the silent Lü, her plump face, tight, small vermilion lips, and the two or three curls of hair hiding beside her ears, I couldn't help but feel a whim. I said, "Don't move, I'll draw a portrait of you."</p>
<p>The "Red Lily" in my hand happened to have a page of neat blank space. I pulled out a pen, and with an ambition comparable to that of the creator, I nimbly wrote down her face.</p>
<p>After finishing the drawing, I asked for a little rouge from her makeup case, dipped my finger in it, and lightly applied it to the cheeks of the person in the drawing.</p>
<p>I gave it back to her, and she smiled sweetly. After looking at it for a moment, she said to me:</p>
<p>"Give it to me. It's drawn too well. Keeping it with you will make me jealous. I don't feel at ease. Give it to me."</p>
<p>My clever mind has long known what is most precious in the world, so I tore off a page of this Red Lily without any reluctance. I know that this is like cooking a crane and burning a zither, but, cooking for a refined scholar and breaking for a confidant, Anatole France is also a discerning person. I know he will surely understand my actions.</p>
<p>With the falling flowers, one spring, the wind also took her away from my sight. For five years, the dust of the world has dimmed the impression she left in my heart. A luxurious "Red Lily" has also long lost its former glory, quietly standing in a corner of the bookshelf. Looking at this book on the shelf, gazing at its dim appearance, a deep regret arose in my heart. I have ended my life of luxury and have long been freed from the net, but it seems that it still carries a haggard lovesickness, yearning for that leaf that was torn off and scattered in the world.</p>

<h3 id="e225">New Scientific Weapons <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Indeed, there are now some people who dislike war and curse it; but, on the other hand, in terms of firepower weaponry, in addition to tanks, armored vehicles, fighter planes, bombers, reconnaissance planes, airships, etc., which stand in the front line, toxic gases are also rapidly progressing, preparing to exert their maximum power. And wireless control (machines, electric cannons, death rays, etc.), which sprouted at the end of the Great War, if the war were to be extended by two or three years, then these kinds of weapons would inevitably have to be moved to the battlefield. However, since the Paris Peace Conference, what is the effect of these weapons? What are the results of the experiments? Countries have not mentioned much, as if there is no such thing. The reason for not mentioning it is that everyone's research on new weapons is particularly secretive, and everyone regards electrical weapons as precious treasures and is unwilling to reveal them easily.</p>
<p>Here, we can decisively say: electrical weapons! Are the most active machines in future wars.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about wireless control! Using radio waves and other radiation, arbitrarily controlling tanks, ships, and airplanes in the vicinity of the battlefield, without harming one's own soldiers, but being able to defeat the enemy, this is called wireless control. Major weapons on the future battlefield, such as explosive airplanes, can carry a large number of bombs and descend upon the enemy's camp, even launching a distant attack on the enemy's capital and major cities; or a ship full of gunpowder can sail like a ghost into the enemy's commercial and military ports and suddenly explode, thereby blockading the harbor. Warships without commanders attack each other with fierce artillery fire on the high seas, while the controllers of these ships are thousands of nautical miles away in a safe zone, drinking tea and smoking cigars while manipulating radio waves.</p>
<p>What is now called war always involves a final bayonet charge. Such things in future wars may become historical relics. Perhaps some people think that this kind of scientific progress is still years away from reappearing. However, facts tell us that wireless control has already had excellent results: I remember that at the end of the Great War in 1917, Germany used mines loaded on airplanes and remotely controlled them with radio to attack the enemy's naval base. Another example is that the U.S. Navy used wireless control to test the dropping of bombs on the battleship "Iowa" the year before last. Recently, when using the 22,000-ton battleship "Utah" as a target ship, wireless control was again tested. There was not a single person managing the battleship, but it was able to speed arbitrarily on the ocean. At present, it is only a live-fire exercise to avoid dangerous tests; but in the future, on land, at sea, and in the air, wireless control will occupy a very important position, that is without doubt.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Hasn't Lin Haiquan come yet?" I heard Zhuo Shuhua's voice in the classroom.</p>
<p>"Go to class."</p>
<p>Zhang Yingkui's unhappy words.</p>
<p>Haiquan was just about to enter the classroom when he saw Zhuo Shuhua, her cheeks flushed, smiling as she walked out. They almost bumped into each other.</p>
<p>"Oh! You're just arriving now. We were just talking about you."</p>
<p>She said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Miss Zhuo, good morning!"</p>
<p>Haiquan also returned her a smile.</p>
<p>Because class was about to start, she hurriedly went upstairs. Haiquan couldn't help but stamp his feet and watch her lively figure as she climbed the escalator. Just as she had climbed three or four steps, she stopped and turned her head back to look down. Their gazes collided again.</p>
<p>"How about coming to my house to sit for a while after class this afternoon?"</p>
<p>Her voice was very soft.</p>
<p>"Aren't you living with Zhang Yingkui?"</p>
<p>"Don't be silly!"</p>
<p>She widened her big eyes and looked at him, then took a pencil from her pocket, quickly wrote a line or more on a notebook, tore off the page, crumpled it into a ball, and threw it at Haiquan's face. The paper ball fell on the ground of the Shuimen River. He hurriedly bent down to pick it up. By this time, she had already run upstairs. He wanted to open the paper ball to see what was written on it, but it was too late. Because Professor Wang walked to the classroom door from the other end. He blushed and hurriedly followed Mr. Wang into the classroom.</p>
<p>(10)</p>
<p>He had just sat down at his table and was about to see what Zhuo Shuhua had written in the paper ball when he was unexpectedly patted on the shoulder by a classmate sitting behind him. Haiquan was startled and quickly stuffed the paper ball back into his pocket. He turned around and saw that Zhu Jun, who was sitting behind him, had handed him a letter.</p>
<p>"Tang Yaoxing asked me to give it to you. He took leave today."</p>
<p>"He's always taking leave."</p>
<p>"That's right, that fellow is very active. I don't know what he's up to."</p>
<p>He really had no time to listen to Professor Wang's lecture. He only felt that he was an important person at this moment, his heart unable to calm down. He first opened Tang Yaoxing's letter.</p>
<p>"Regarding the matter we discussed yesterday, I have already arranged with the front. I hope to go to my place with you at 7:00 p.m. on the 5th. Yao Qi".</p>
<p>After reading it, he felt that it was inappropriate, because the date set by Tang Yaoxing conflicted with the date when Mr. and Mrs. Ren invited him to dinner.</p>

<h3 id="e227">After the Resumption of Relations <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the resumption of relations between China and Russia, my friend said: "China is saved." Perhaps the degree of this "saving" does not necessarily mean that China can be lifted from the eighteenth level of hell to become the world's number one strong country, but the resumption of relations between China and Russia is indeed a happy event. For example, two good friends who suddenly fall out over a trivial matter are now reconciled again, and of course both parties have unspeakable joy in their hearts. Moreover, the fact that our compatriots are singing and dancing because of the resumption of relations is also a fact, as evidenced by the current newspapers. The Tianjin business community generally approves of the resumption of relations with Russia. After the Russian consul arrives in Tianjin, they will deliberate on purchasing Russian goods to replace enemy goods.</p>
<p>No problem, the resumption of relations between China and Russia naturally benefits our business friends greatly. Originally, our poor and weak country cannot avoid being supplied with foreign goods. If this is the case, if the source of goods is cheap, of course those doing business can make a few more profits. Then Russian goods are cheap, which is expected, because according to Russia's trade policy, its export of goods is not for the purpose of making money, but not without the idea of mutual communication: exporting products that cannot be consumed domestically to foreign countries, exchanging them for money, and then buying important industrial products that the country does not have or lacks. Therefore, what is sold to China can naturally be much cheaper than the goods of capitalist countries. In this way, of course, our business community can smile happily, with silver dollars and ingots rolling in.</p>
<p>As for saying that Russian goods are used to replace enemy goods, it is also naturally possible. And it sounds even better in name. Although selling enemy goods makes money, it always carries some risk and is also given the title of "奸商" [treacherous merchant]. Do you think that Russian calico is not enough to compete with enemy printed calico? So since it makes money and is "patriotic," and due to this moving appeal, more customers can be attracted, achieving several goals in one fell swoop, why not do it?</p>
<p>Therefore, everyone is happy about this resumption of relations, and the comrades in the Tianjin business community are even happier. Well then, the Emperor's grace is vast, and the whole world is celebrating together. And everyone says: "We are saved from now on."</p>

<h3 id="e229">The Function and Illuminating Apparatus of X-Rays <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yong</p>
<p>In the scientific world today, there are various names for light rays, such as infrared light (Infrared Light), ultraviolet light (Ultraviolet Light), etc. Since they are all a kind of light, why must so many names be given? Of course, there are differences between them. In fact, however, their wavelengths are slightly different.</p>
<p>The X-rays that we are going to talk about now, according to the research of scientists, have been proven in many ways to be the same as light, but just different in the light wave. The light wave of X-rays is particularly short, only one ten-thousandth of that of sunlight (SunRays). This is indeed a mysterious and mysterious light ray. People have used its power to do things that could not be done before and to understand the principles of the world that were not discovered before. Therefore, X-rays are really new products of civilized progress and scientific prosperity, and they are also a kind of power that helps the progress of world culture. Now, let me introduce the functions of X-rays in sections:</p>
<p>(1) The function for medicine 丨 The most common is that you can see broken bones, or bullets that have fallen into the body, and internal diseases such as tuberculosis can also be treated. Even the most dangerous internal carbuncle (Cancer) can be treated in the early stages using the R-rays or X-rays. At least it can be reduced somewhat. These are all cases where the disease has been contracted and treated with it. Apart from this, we can rely on this power to prevent diseases. That is, people without obvious or special problems can use X-ray photos to examine their bodies. If there are any shortcomings, they can first find ways to prevent or nourish themselves. From the above, how great is the contribution of X-rays to medicine?</p>
<p>(2) Function for industry 丨 Now machines have too much function for people's lives, but the more powerful the machine, the more careful you are, the consequences of the accident are directly proportional to its power. Therefore, if there are any problems with these metal castings, such as kerosene burning pots, airplane rotors, such as whether there are air holes, cracks, or sand inclusions, it is necessary to rely on the results of X-ray observation to avoid defects. There are also inspections of the quality of welding (Weld), the insect eyes and knots of wood, the inner diameter of measuring metal objects, and the investigation of the blockage of gasoline pipes, which also need to be seen with the help of X-rays. There is also a kind of asbestos that often looks similar but has different practical properties, and only X-rays can analyze it. In addition, gelatin, explosives, paraffin, cowhide, coal, and cement can all be used with X-rays to determine their quality.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>(3) Contribution to physics 丨 Relying on the power of X-rays, we can study the internal structure of matter, and understand the principles of atoms and molecules. Although a microscope (Microscope) can magnify matter thousands of times, the smallest unit of matter's structure can never be seen, and only X-rays can give us the final solution. The function of X-rays mentioned above has been briefly discussed. Now, I will briefly explain its device.</p>
<p>For the common manufacturing method, first take a glass tube and blow it into a spherical shape. The diameter of the glass ball is about six inches. At each end of the ball, connect a glass tube with a diameter of about one inch. A tungsten (Tungsten) electrode should be installed in the tube. One end is like a copper coin, which is the cathode; one end of the anode is plate-shaped, and the plane is inclined at forty-five degrees. After installation, evacuate the air in the tube completely and seal the tube mouth, then it is finished. When in use, connect an electric induction coil (Induction Coie) to the two electrodes. Electrons emitted from the cathode are called cathode rays (Cathode Rays). The speed of emission is very fast. When it encounters tungsten, it emits this mysterious X-ray, which cannot be seen by our naked eyes, but can penetrate various substances and the effect can be photographed.</p>
<p>Recently, a kind of X-ray tube called Coulidge tube has been invented by Dr. Coulidge of the United States. The method is to take a tungsten helix as the cathode and pass the current of a storage battery through it, just like an electric lamp. If the voltage of the battery is very high, it can emit very strong X-rays.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Respect and Cherish Written Paper <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>丨Two Different Views丨</p>
<p>The office, fifteen minutes after lunch, is a place for free discussion. As usual, each person lights a cigarette and engages in discussions that contribute nothing to the people's livelihood, hoping to elicit a laugh. Conversations range from major national affairs to minor neighborhood matters, covering everything.</p>
<p>Today, after lunch, everyone sat down as usual, and just as they were about to start a verbal battle but hadn't found a topic, the office boy came to empty the wastepaper basket, and so the conversation started from there. Little Zhang said, "I really don't understand why people advocate 'respect and cherish written paper'? Once a newspaper or a page of an old book is discarded, its usefulness has already been lost. Is such wastepaper really worth respecting?"</p>
<p>"Not so," said Mr. Chen, whom we always call "Senior," and who usually doesn't participate in discussions. Suddenly, everyone perked up. He said, "Writing was created by the ancient sages and is a powerful tool for spreading culture; its contribution is great. Therefore, regardless of whether it is useful or not, it should be respected. If you see written paper on the road, you should pick it up and burn it, not trample on it." The old gentleman said very seriously.</p>
<p>"This is a traditional view, a strategy used by the 'scholar' class in the past to elevate their status. Let me ask, if you say that writing should be respected because it was created by the ancient sages and is a powerful tool for spreading culture, then what nation doesn't have its own writing, and what kind of writing doesn't spread culture? And why, sir, did you just use an English newspaper to wipe the table, but you respectfully placed a piece of wastepaper with Chinese characters into the wastepaper basket? Isn't this a contradiction? Therefore, 'respect and cherish written paper' is just a traditional view, a habit, and something that doesn't need to be respected now!" Little Li retorted layer by layer like a lawyer.</p>
<p>"I think written paper doesn't necessarily need to be respected, but wastepaper is worth cherishing, and it's a pity to burn it. Because paper mills can collect it and remake it!" Old Yang, true to his pragmatic nature, offered another opinion.</p>
<p>"Burning it is still the best," Senior replied simply to Old Yang. "Paper mills collect it and destroy the writing, which is terrible and sinful. Moreover, the ashes of written paper are also useful; when sailing and encountering wind, they can be poured into the water to suppress the wind!"</p>
<p>Old Yang said, "This is a 'myth,' and we are talking about 'human talk.' Utilizing waste is not a sinful thing!"</p>
<p>"You are all young people, only talking about utilization..."</p>
<p>Senior said silently, filled with disappointment, and went back to his seat to work.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Strange Events Discovered This Year <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Hong</p>
<p>"Strange events happen every year, but this year is especially full of them!" A friend of mine said this as soon as he saw me. I hurriedly asked him what strange events he was talking about. He said, "Please sit down, please sit down! Let me tell you slowly..."</p>
<p>The first strange event is that a ghost appeared in the Xian'en Temple (?) in Yixing. Moreover, it is a young female ghost, weeping day and night, and interacting with heroic soldiers. This is a tragic and headless romantic case, possibly involving a monk in a lonely temple raping and murdering a solitary young girl. The strange thing is that the ghost can appeal to the heroic soldiers, and can cry, understand human intentions, and even obtain a blood-stained garment and skeletal remains, providing evidence for the case. Naturally, one cannot say that it is superstition or not. This case has already been sent to Nanjing for examination and is now being sent to Shanghai for investigation.</p>
<p>The second strange event is that a monster appeared in a certain place (forgive me for not remembering the place name). Its shape is like a sheep, and a certain young girl from a certain village was bewitched by it. Whenever the monster came, the young girl would climb onto the bed and make obscene remarks. Over time, she became emaciated and unrecognizable, having been ravaged by the monster. Later, this young girl was sent to the Qi family to be hidden away. Then, two sisters with a certain surname suffered the same ravaging. This strange event was reported in newspapers with detailed and convincing accounts, including names and surnames, indicating that it truly happened. Can you say that it is just nonsense like the stories of Qi Dong?</p>
<p>The third strange event is that Liang Zuoyou donated 30 million to save the country, but in the end, he didn't have a penny and was chased away by people. A young man who sells sesame cakes and fried dough sticks was able to travel to the capital, talk about national affairs with important figures in the National Government, and make shocking statements. Truly a strange person and a strange event.</p>
<p>The fourth strange event is that the Heavenly Emperor, Earthly Emperor, and Human Emperor appeared in Linyi County, Shandong Province, China. The Heavenly Emperor is Li Yuechuan, the Empress is Song Wangshi, and the Earthly Emperor is a tailor named Fu Baoqi. They planned to ascend the throne next March, fulfilling their imperial dream, proclaiming themselves as true Sons of Heaven, and selecting concubines and palace maids. It is said that the Heavenly Emperor had already appointed the Liu sisters, the fifth and sixth daughters of the county, as the Empresses of the East and West Palaces. Unfortunately, the emperor did not succeed, and now the Heavenly Emperor, Earthly Emperor, and Empress are all in prison. The Human Emperor is conveniently on the run. This is truly a strange event. In the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, three true Sons of Heaven actually appeared!</p>
<p>Now, the twenty-first year of the Republic of China is almost over, and this year can be considered to have had many strange events. Confucius said, "When a country is about to perish, there will surely be monsters!" Now that the Northeast has fallen and Tianjin and Peiping are in danger, if he is unfortunately proven right, that would be terrible, and we would become quasi-slaves of a fallen nation!"</p>
<p>My friend spoke eloquently, leaving me stunned and seeing only darkness before my eyes!</p>

<h3 id="e232">The Experience of Seeking Another Chance to Study, Editor: <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Today, after reading Mr. Zhu's article "How to Get Another Chance to Study," I was immediately filled with endless feelings. This is truly a case of shared suffering! Currently, I am personally working hard to fight against reality. Although I don't know what the result will be, I might as well write about my difficult journey of studying for everyone's reference.</p>
<p>My studies were fraught with many setbacks from the beginning. In my childhood, I indulged in play, and it wasn't until after graduating from elementary school that I realized that studying was very interesting. Later, I don't know why, but I switched to a private school, reciting the Analects for less than half a year, "eating without tasting its flavor." Then, I transferred to an English school with no teaching methods, specializing day and night. During this process, life was monotonous and extremely boring. After two years, I resolved to transfer to a higher elementary school, and it wasn't until the age of sixteen that I was able to graduate. The suffering during this time was entirely due to the improper guidance of my parents, who had no fixed direction, leading me astray.</p>
<p>Due to family circumstances, I had no choice but to enter the business world, completely interrupting my passionate desire to study. However, I was able to become an apprentice in a warehouse of a company in Pudong, which, in terms of opportunity, was not bad. Outside of work, I also had quite a bit of leisure time. Of course! My thirst for knowledge, which I never forgot day and night, surged up like the tide.</p>
<p>I thought, "The opportunity to study again" has arrived! So I enrolled in a commercial English night school in the city. Knowing that I was striving to learn, I made rapid progress. After completing the course, I enrolled in a Chinese-English night school, from which I graduated the year before. Then, I consulted various books and engaged in self-study; but I encountered many questions that were very difficult to solve, even after consulting the dictionary. It was inconvenient to ask my former teachers. It wasn't until the autumn of this year that I was admitted to a certain college. Now? I feel that I am struggling to keep up with the course, especially the foreign professors, whose lectures I simply cannot understand. However, I am still humbly determined, ignoring everything except the tasks that need to be done, and working diligently day and night. I believe I will eventually find the light.</p>

<p>A young person who drops out of school halfway and enters the business world certainly feels very painful. To resolve this pain and satisfy his desire for knowledge is, of course, a very important matter. Now, I will express my opinions below for the reference of those who have dropped out of school.</p>
<p>(1) If an apprentice, trainee, or clerk has free time at night, they can join a night school to study.</p>
<p>(2) If the store's rules are that "clerks and apprentices are not allowed to go out at night," or if all free time is uncertain, then joining a correspondence school is more appropriate.</p>
<p>(3) If there is free time but economic problems arise, then the only option is to read more beneficial newspapers and books during daily life, or to communicate more with former classmates. Because those who are able to continue their studies will naturally know more places than you, and you can also ask them about things you don't understand.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Despite my usual ability to remain calm, I couldn't help but exclaim "Ah!"</p>
<p>"Haha! This is really a coincidence. Mr. Zhu, we haven't seen each other for almost three years!" She still smiled and talked as she used to.</p>
<p>I still remember when she was at Kouda, sitting high on the Queen's throne. Anyone who saw her couldn't help but praise, "How beautiful!" Even I, though I didn't worship her, couldn't deny her beauty. Now I see her again. Comparing her to you, one can't find where her beauty lies. At least you are a fairy; she is at most a demon!</p>
<p>"Ah! Miss Li! No, maybe you are now Madam Something, but we are old classmates," a humorous person, no matter when, even lying on the dissecting table in the hospital, can't help but say a few jokes. "No matter what Madam you are, I still have to call you Miss. Your Majesty the Queen! Is that right?"</p>
<p>She giggled, lasting a full four or five minutes.</p>
<p>Da Jing used to be infatuated with her because of the magic of this laugh. At that time, they were both top students in the law department. I, on the other hand, was studying economics; but because she was the Queen of the whole school, a Queen who was good at socializing, I often met her. And every time I saw her, I always saw Da Jing with her; he was like a loyal and filial subject, very respectfully following behind her high-heeled shoes.</p>
<p>The bachelor's thesis that Li Fang submitted upon graduation was also written by Da Jing. Little friend! Imagine, in a hot early summer, Da Jing writing two theses at the same time, not to mention how much brainpower was squeezed out, the stinky sweat that flowed must have been no less than twenty pounds! Originally, where love lies, even shedding blood, let alone sweat, is willing; what was distressing was that Miss Li was not moved by it!</p>
<p>Da Jing's infatuation with Li Fang, regardless of everything, was indeed a sensation throughout the school at that time. Da Jing was originally a bookworm who spent all day crouching in the library, and no one had ever seen him on the sports field, partly because he was too physically weak; but once Li Fang actually had the ability to encourage him to participate in the inter-class football game, making him wear a pair of nearsighted glasses with a depth of five or six hundred degrees, exposing a body that only showed bones and no flesh, mixed among many strong men of Yan and Zhao, and brave warriors of the South, desperately working hard. The result, of course, was a hundred jokes and physical disabilities; while Li Fang leaned in the arms of another man, laughing wildly for sixty minutes. For a woman to play with a man like this, one can't help but make men feel ashamed! But Da Jing enjoyed it and considered it an unparalleled honor.</p>
<p>Li Fang's father, it is said, had served as a military commander, and since he had been a military commander, he would naturally make money; since he knew how to make money, the family was naturally very wealthy; since the family was wealthy, Li Fang's expenses were naturally extravagant. However, this lady's spending was really too extravagant. Although the money the family gave her was not a small amount, she still felt that it was not enough; so Da Jing became her treasurer, inevitably bowing and scraping to provide her with his own money.</p>
<p>But Da Jing was not born into a wealthy family. Beautiful little pig, you probably already know that! The money he used to study at Kouda was supported by his mother selling the family's land. So, no matter how frugal and diligent he was himself, not daring to waste a penny, just socializing with this Queen was already too much to handle. One winter, he was only wearing a very thin camel hair robe, and his legs were playing the pipa in the classroom for more than a month; later, I secretly asked him, and I learned that his two leather robes had turned around in the pawnshop and were listed under the Queen's extra income account.</p>

<h3 id="e235">Summary of Conversations with Architect Wudak on Designing a Twenty-Two Story Building for the Four Banks <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The twenty-two story building of the Four Banks Savings Society, currently under construction, is the tallest building in Shanghai. This publication believes that such a great project must have things worth studying for the construction industry, so the reporter and Mr. Sun Liyi, the architect of the Four Banks Construction Department, visited architect Wudak, the designer of the new building. He was kind enough to tell us the general situation, which we have recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Portrait of Architect Wudak</p>
<p>This Building is the Tallest Building Outside of the Americas</p>
<p>A site of the same size has a building of a certain size. As far as the new building of the Four Banks is concerned, its volume is 1.6 million cubic feet. If the entire area of the site, including the area currently occupied by Yunfei Automobile Company, is used to build the new building, then its average height would be 84 feet. However, the side facing the road has superior advantages in terms of location, traffic, air, light, and appearance. Therefore, it was decided not to include the area occupied by Yunfei. As a result, the height of the new building can be increased to 264 feet. As for the piles, they are 115 feet long, connected by 75-foot and 45-foot fir wood with steel hoops. In addition, 20 feet were excavated, for a total depth of 135 feet. Within this 20-foot excavation, a 5-foot deep reinforced concrete foundation was made to further strengthen the foundation. As for the mud excavated within the 20 feet, it weighed 11 million pounds. In other words, this 11 million pounds is the buoyancy used to calculate the moving load (Line Load) of 18 million pounds. Therefore, the two can be offset, so the piles only bear the fixed load (Dead Load). The value of the piles alone is comparable to that of an ordinary three-story building.</p>
<p>The new building weighs 33 million pounds. The entire framework is made of alloy brass steel, supplied by Siemens China. This steel material is produced by Wanne Lin Steel Factory, and it is extremely tough and excellent. As for the pressure generated by the wind force, it is about three times the pressure of the new building itself. Therefore, the wind force calculation of this building is one of its special features. The new building has very few walls. Even if there are any, they are made of unusually strong and lightweight bricks, carefully constructed. The new building adopts a three-dimensional style, so as to increase its height. In addition, Mr. Lindsgog and Mr. Zoepke of the United Steel Factory also provided a lot of assistance in the design of the new building.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Overview of the Four Banks Building <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Liyi</p>
<p>The rise and fall of world industry and commerce is often measured by the number of buildings, and the growth and decline of buildings is directly proportional to the progress and decline of business. After the Great War, the rise of industry and commerce in the United States was fully reflected in the sudden increase in the number of buildings. The rapid advancement of its industrial technology reached its peak in 1928. After 1930, all industries stagnated, and the construction industry also showed signs of decline.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the total savings of the Four Banks Savings Society has increased from 140,000 to more than 54 million in ten years, an increase of about 40 times. Its architecture has also changed from old three-story buildings to self-built seven-story buildings, and branch offices have been established everywhere, and self-built warehouses have been built. As for the recent plan, it will be in 1933, when the twenty-two story building will be offered to our ever-changing city of Shanghai, to serve the public, and to build a permanent symbol in East Asia. It is also sufficient to represent the success of the joint cooperation between this society and 100,000 depositors.</p>
<p>The new building is located between Jing'an Temple Road, Parker Road, and Baker Road, only a stone's throw from the city center and the Bund. It is especially convenient for transportation to the residential areas of the British and French concessions. It faces the vast racecourse, and there are entertainment venues and movie theaters nearby, which will be the center of Shanghai's nightlife in the future. It is located at the transportation hub of the city, and it is a necessary route for traffic to and from the north, south, east, and west districts. This building will definitely be the best choice for banks and hotels.</p>
<p>The building occupies a foundation of 12,400 square feet, with two parts, front and back. The front part is 22 stories, 264 feet from the street, and the back part is 15 stories, with a roof garden on top. The entire building uses 1,200 tons of lightweight I-beam material as the frame, and cement and sand as the walls, covered with face bricks. Reinforced concrete floor slabs and aerated concrete brick partitions are used. The entire building uses large glass steel windows. The front part is equipped with three high-speed elevators for passengers, and the back part is equipped with two 300-foot speed elevators for servants and for loading and unloading goods.</p>
<p>The situation of each floor is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Lowest Floor (15 feet below ground)</p>
<p>(A) The society's cash vault, with 1-inch steel bars and 12-inch reinforced concrete walls, and a 12-inch new-style safe door. There are two staircases, which are both strong and convenient. (B) The society's safety deposit box, for storing valuables for depositors, with half-inch steel plates on all sides. There are 4,000 safety deposit boxes of various sizes, two 16-inch safe doors, cork floors, and new-style reflective lights. Outside the vault, there are 16 small rooms for tenants to check their stored items, and there is air conditioning and heating equipment.</p>
<p>(C) Boiler room, with three 79-inch large boilers to supply all heating, hot water, and high pressure, and one small boiler for the kitchen.</p>
<p>(2) Bottom Floor (8 feet below ground)</p>
<p>Account book vault, sundries vault, and silver vault, hot water storage tank. The remaining space is the upper part of the safety deposit box and boiler room.</p>
<p>(3) First Floor</p>
<p>(A) Main entrance and passageway. The exterior of the main entrance is stone-built, facing south towards the racecourse. Inside the door is a 160-foot passageway that leads directly to the counter area, west to the manager's office and affiliated offices, and one door on the east leads to the hotel, and another door leads to the safety deposit box.</p>
<p>(B) Counter area, 19 feet high, occupying about 3,600 square feet of space, all decorated with marble. New-style reflective lights and various latest equipment are provided, and everything is available to facilitate depositors.</p>
<p>(C) The southeast corner of the gate is made of cobblestones, specially used as a reception room for hotels. The three high-speed elevators used in the counter area are all located here.</p>
<p>(4) Second floor, only one partition is used as the office for the director and deputy director, and the offices of various departments of the General Assembly.</p>
<p>(5) Third floor, hotel, dining room, and wine room, etc.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>It has many features. Facing the racecourse, the entire area of West Zanglu and Jing'an Temple Road is in view. Therefore, large glass doors and windows are used on all three sides, and the windows are filled with fresh flowers and trees. In spring and autumn, when the flowers and trees are lush, watching horse races on the upper floor is like being in a flower garden. As for the equipment of air conditioning and reflective lights, it is even more unnecessary.</p>
<p>(6) Fourth floor, the front part is the passenger lounge and smoking room. The back part is the large kitchen. The kitchen is divided into three floors, with various meat cold storage rooms, cooking rooms, and cake-making rooms.</p>
<p>Its layout and equipment are all rationalized, similar to large European and American hotels, and even better.</p>
<p>(7) From the fifth to the fourteenth floors, there are guest rooms, rooms of various sizes, and the equipment is all excellent, such as wireless broadcasting and personal bathrooms, which are more novel and exquisite than ordinary hotels in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(8) The fifteenth floor is the roof garden and the large wine room, dance floor, etc., 160 feet above the ground. Its wide location and fresh air will be the only summer resort in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(9) The sixteenth to twentieth floors are small residences with two or three rooms, about 200 feet above the street. It is quiet and spacious away from the city center, which should be no different from living in the mountains.</p>
<p>(10) The twenty-first floor is open to the public for viewing, and the beautiful scenery of Shanghai can be seen at a glance. With the help of telescopes, you can see Pudong, Wusong, Zhenru, and Longhua.</p>
<p>(11) The twenty-second floor is the observation post for the Shanghai Fire Brigade. Fires within ten miles of the concession can be detected at any time.</p>
<p>The project is only one-third complete, and it will be fully opened by this time next year, adding to the visual pleasure of the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao Jungui, from Guilin, Nantong, has been operating the Fook Kee Construction Factory since its establishment. Based on his experience and strength, his construction achievements are remarkable. In recent years, he has devoted himself to this field, and many major projects in various outports have been undertaken by him, achieving remarkable results and a soaring reputation. He is a standout talent in the construction industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Fulin, from Wuxian, is a rare talent in construction. He is extremely experienced in factory organization and factory management, and his knowledge is particularly rich. Since he has been in charge of the 22-story building project of the Four Banks Savings Society, the management and organization have been well-organized. The rapid progress of the building project shows this.</p>

<p>On January 24th, 1923, representatives from the Yien Yieh, Kincheng, China &amp; South Sea, and Continental Banks met in Beiping and resolved to establish the Four Banks Savings Society under the Joint Business Office. They agreed on the regulations and articles of association and appointed Mr. Zhou Zuomin, General Manager of Kincheng Bank, Mr. Hu Yun, General Manager of China &amp; South Sea Bank, Mr. Tan Lisun, General Manager of Continental Bank, and Mr. Wu Dingchang, General Manager of Yien Yieh Bank, as executive committee members. Mr. Wu Dingchang was elected as chairman, responsible for all affairs of the society. In February 1926, Mr. Qian Yongming was appointed as vice-chairman. Currently, there are Four Banks Savings Societies in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou, and branches in Nanjing, Beiping, and other places, specializing in accepting various types of savings, including fixed-term, long-term, installment, and current deposits. Fixed-term deposits start from a minimum of twenty-five yuan, with a maturity of two years. Long-term deposits also start from a minimum of twenty-five yuan, with options of five or ten years. Five-year deposits accrue compound interest annually. Ten-year deposits accrue compound interest semi-annually. Installment deposits start from a minimum of one yuan per month, with a maturity of twenty-five months. All three types are guaranteed by the society with an annual interest rate of seven percent, and dividends are distributed within the term. Current deposits are divided into two types, A and B. Type A has an annual interest rate of four percent, and Type B has an annual interest rate of three percent, both of which are also eligible for dividends. Since the society's establishment in June 1923, the total amount of savings has increased from over one million four hundred and thirty thousand yuan (end of 1923) to over fifty-two million eight hundred and twenty thousand yuan (end of 1931). The highest total interest and dividend income received by depositors in previous years reached 11.7%, and the lowest was above 9.5%. The society's operations strictly comply with the regulations for savings banks, prioritizing stability, while the organization has a cooperative nature. All depositors are members, and dividends are distributed equally. The abridged accounts are checked and published by accountants and announced to members, ensuring complete transparency. The society's articles of association were submitted to the government for approval on March 14, 1923, and were approved by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government on August 27, 1931.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Implementation of Architectural Engineering Education in Three Major American Universities <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Translated and narrated by Yuan Xianghua of the Shanghai Architectural Association</p>
<p>The advancement of modern science has made it impossible for those engaged in architecture to rely solely on practical experience, as they did in the past. Today, they must possess versatile talents to cope with the ever-evolving architectural industry. It goes without saying that architects must understand the process or steps involved in creating good architecture and should pay close attention to structural design. Structural planning is the central issue in creating good architecture, and neglecting it will inevitably lead to failure. Other aspects, such as construction management, material procurement, and miscellaneous tasks, all require skilled talent to handle. However, architects who possess the above qualities are rare, yet there is a large demand for them today.</p>
<p>A young person who wants to acquire practical architectural knowledge can learn from the factory floor through careful observation and diligent self-study. After a considerable period, they may be able to handle certain tasks with ease. However, architectural design and engineering management cannot be effectively learned through self-study alone and require guidance to grasp the essentials. However, architects, as chief engineers, are often too busy managing their own affairs to provide guidance to young apprentices. This is a real difficulty, and they cannot be blamed for it. Even with proper guidance on architectural design and engineering management, apprentices' knowledge is limited to their own industry or factory and rarely have the opportunity to develop new ideas or make connections between different fields. Therefore, a young person can easily acquire practical architectural knowledge in the workplace, but architectural theory cannot be obtained from the factory floor. However, relying solely on experience without emphasizing theory will lead to the drawback of "knowing what but not why." Therefore, success as an architect is difficult.</p>
<p>The development of the American architectural industry has reached its peak today. People enjoy the utmost happiness in living, which is due to the abundance of national economic power. However, the popularization of architectural knowledge among the general public is also a major reason for the rapid development of the domestic architectural industry. The government actively cultivates architectural talent to meet future needs, and private individuals or construction companies contribute funds to establish scholarships or lectureships at various universities to encourage young students to pursue architecture. The most notable example is the Thompson Starret Foundation, established by Louis J. Horowitz and Herwilz, which donated to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Yale University, and Union College for the establishment of architectural programs. In addition to the above foundation, the Horowitz couple also established scholarships to be awarded to outstanding graduates of the three universities who wish to pursue architecture and undergo designated internships at Thompson Starret Co. in New York. For clarity, the implementation of architectural engineering education at the three universities is summarized below for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Stone Masonry Design (One of the Exercises for Students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>1.  Massachusetts Institute of Technology</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is one of the most famous universities of science and engineering in the United States. The Department of Architecture is a combination of the seventeen sciences and engineering disciplines in the school. This department became an independent college in 1926, at which time there were only seventeen students, but it has been extremely developed to this day. The person in charge is Professor Ross F. Tucker. The duration of study is four years. All general disciplines relating to architecture are fully equipped. Students receive basic training in various disciplines in the first year. From the second year, they make on-site investigations of residential buildings. In the third year, they engage in the construction of industrial factory buildings. The first step is the simple</p>
<p>pile foundation design (Practice II for students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology)</p>
<p>factory building construction of brick, stone, and wood. Then they proceed to the construction of cement. In the fourth year, they advance to the construction of steel-framed commercial buildings. After the professor lectures to a certain stage, he distributes the lecture outline to the students, instructing each student to prepare a report within one week using his own opinions and return it to the professor. After evaluation, it is returned again. This method is thoroughly implemented throughout the duration of study and is never interrupted. Therefore, when each student graduates, he can collect past reports and compile them into a volume as an excellent permanent reference material. The implementation of this teaching method is to cultivate students' ability to make automatic inventions and sound judgments or appreciation, thereby preventing past teaching materials from being forgotten and permanently engraved in their minds. In addition, oral and written examinations are also held on time. The scope of the examination includes ancient and modern architecture, so students must have a considerable understanding and image of modern and past architecture. Graduates receive a bachelor's degree and can also obtain the above-mentioned Horowitz Scholarship.</p>
<p>The university pays special attention to the four points of architectural materials: 1. source, 2. quality, 3. use, 4. procurement. This is also what we should pay attention to. The difference between the Department of Architecture and other engineering departments may also be based on this. Graduates of general architecture or engineering departments often neglect the point of architectural materials and do not have a special study. This is a great obstacle to their future development. It is important to know that architectural materials are like the skeleton of the human body and are the element that forms the entire building. Sometimes, after these graduates have entered the architectural industry or other businesses related to architecture, what they can work hard on or pay attention to is only the design or implementation of the project. As for substantive issues (architectural materials), as a result of neglecting them in student days, they must now work hard again and spend a considerable amount of time to study and investigate them before they can understand one or two of the above four points. In addition, the university's teaching purpose is also to cultivate people with quick thinking and swift action. Once an architectural difficulty arises, a decision should be made immediately and there can be no hesitation. And an architect is in a chaotic environment, and there is no time to hesitate. At that time, the steps or process of construction must be clear in mind, and there must be the ability to decide and judge on the construction instructions or the inspection of the structure. At this time, it is naturally impossible to carry reference books for on-site comparison. The knowledge of an architect must always be applied and there can be no interruption. Therefore, the university's education method is more important than "learning for use!"</p>
<p>2.  Yale University</p>
<p>The Department of Architecture at Yale University is affiliated with the Sheld Scientific School of Yale Uni. The distribution of courses for each academic year is outlined below:</p>
<p>1.  All courses in the first semester of the first year of university are similar to those of engineering in other universities. Such as: English, history, chemistry, mathematics, engineering drawing, etc. If all the subjects in the first year can pass, there will be no difficulty in advancing to the second year.</p>
<p>2.  All courses in the second semester of the second year of university</p>
<p>are still basic subjects, in preparation for further studies next year. They include: physics, engineering mechanics, mathematics, engineering drawing, and English, etc.</p>
<p>3.  From the third year to the third academic year, all courses begin to differ from those of the engineering department. In the first semester, considerable attention is still paid to physics, etc., and structural planning occupies a very important position in all disciplines. An overview of economics and an introduction to architecture are required courses. The principles of architecture, which are devoted to architectural materials, architectural comparison, standard design, etc., are also required in the second semester.</p>
<h3 id="e240">One of the Extracurricular Activities of Yale University Students <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>4.  The disciplines from the fourth year to the fourth academic year tend towards practice, such as steel-framed cement construction, etc., and are given great attention. At this time, students are engaged in the design and implementation of architecture and the preparation of working drawings. In order to facilitate business after graduation, considerable attention is also paid to commercial subjects. In the first semester, the principles of accounting are taught, and in the second semester, there are engineering management contract research instruction research, etc. Such as project valuation, cost analysis, etc., are all given attention, so that scholars can have a good understanding of modern architectural science both theoretically and practically.</p>
<p>In addition, Yale University students attach great importance to summer work. There are three summer vacations during the four-year study period, each lasting four weeks. Architecture students use this time to practice abroad. The first summer (that is, the summer vacation between the first and second academic years, and so on.) is devoted to plane surveying. The second summer vacation advances to topographic surveying Topographic Sutveying The third summer vacation is led by a professor to visit</p>
<p>A photograph of the construction of the Rongjin Grand Theater, undertaken by Zhushengji Construction Factory</p>
<p>and inspection, the scope of which includes construction factories, architectural firms, material testing laboratories, and building material manufacturing factories, so that students can understand the organization of the entire architectural industry and its activities.</p>
<p>The implementation of various disciplines in the above academic years is still a kind of mechanical training. In addition, the school authorities are working hard to cultivate students' ability to have a broad perspective, so as not to be confined to one corner, so as to avoid the ridicule of sitting in a well and watching the sky. Students should pay attention to the disciplines of architecture, and it goes without saying that they should also have considerable research and cultivation in languages, aesthetics, and other aspects: and they should carefully consider the importance of their own position and the preparation for employment after graduation.</p>
<h3 id="e241">3. Union College <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>The Architectural Engineering Department of this university was first established with a donation from the Thompson Foundation. The duration of study is four years. In the first and second academic years, general architectural disciplines such as drawing, surveying, mathematics, and English are taught. In the third academic year, mechanics, economics, railway construction, hydraulics, and other disciplines directly related to architecture are taught. From the previous year, two courses of architectural materials and architectural form have been added. Students practice one of the drawings</p>

<p>Part of the actual valuation, sometimes or engaged in the design of the renovation of existing buildings. When there is time after class, they practice the use of machinery, the installation of full lead pipes in houses, and the design of electrical engineering. In addition, pile foundations and skeletons are given great attention.</p>
<p>Among the courses offered at Union College, the structure course, regardless of theory or practice, is given more importance than others. In addition, great attention is also paid to economics, accounting, and corporation finance. It is assumed that when students go out to work, they will not have any regrets about financial management.</p>
<p>4. Other</p>
<p>In addition to the Thompson Foundation donating to the Architectural Engineering Departments of the three universities mentioned above, the Horowitz couple also donated considerable funds to Carnegie Institute Technogy to cultivate architectural talent. The person in charge is Professor Clifford G. Dunnejis. In the course offered, attention is paid to both the theory and practice of architectural engineering. The purpose of this university to cultivate talent is to cultivate students' ability to be independent implementers. Courses such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, mechanics, structural principles, as well as experiments in carpentry, brickwork, electrical work, and mechanical engineering are held on time, so that students do not have the disadvantage of disregarding experiments. Surveying is a required course. During the summer vacation between the second and third academic years, students must go out to practice. In addition, each student also visits the architectural projects that are in progress outside of class to supplement the lack of teaching materials with on-site observation, thereby developing new ideas and connecting them on their own.</p>

<p>— Zong Wen</p>
<p>Now, the general public in society pays too little attention to entertainment! And what they call entertainment is just some improper things… such as gambling and playing mahjong, just to pass the precious time. How dangerous this is! The harm is indeed not shallow! This is also one of the reasons why our China is weak. In Yeping's article "Amateur Entertainment and Playing Mahjong" in the second issue of the amateur weekly of this newspaper, the harm of this kind of improper entertainment has been said very thoroughly! But why do people generally neglect proper entertainment instead? The reason is that there are too few public entertainment buildings in the city; even if there are, they are just some private ones, so they cannot be universal to the general public. Therefore, because of this, the general public in the city will not pay attention to it. Therefore, if we want to make people in society abandon improper entertainment, we must start from building more public entertainment buildings in the city… But how should we design public entertainment buildings? This is what I want to talk about now. Speaking of public entertainment buildings, there are of course many kinds… such as gardens, sports fields, lawns, theaters… etc. Because these buildings</p>
<p>sufficient to make people interested, promote the spirit, make people healthy, and can cultivate the general aesthetic psychology… of course, its benefits are many! But look at our old China, there are too few public entertainment buildings of this kind! Even in Shanghai, which is prosperous in the country, except for the general private entertainment buildings, public entertainment buildings are really unique! This is really pitiful! Look at the countries in Europe and the United States, which attach great importance to the happy undertakings of the people. In the large and small cities, at the crossroads, there are always several squares of lawns and parks built for pedestrians to rest; (Shanghai only has the Bund area, but it is only a decoration) and various public games are set up, such as dance halls, parks, swimming pools, etc. Of course, this adds a lot of color to the city scenery! It can be called a "beautiful city." Because of this, it is enough to cultivate a strong nation, create various undertakings, and the country is therefore strong. From this, we know that the facilities of public entertainment buildings are also an element in building a perfect city, and this is not enough to show the beauty of the city. Therefore, in urban planning, a plan for public entertainment construction is also indispensable. Looking at China, because there are too few buildings of this kind… therefore, the general people have no proper entertainment to pass the time, and the spirit is therefore trapped, resulting in the pain of life. It is important to know that the spirit is the living element of life; if there is one, there is nothing that cannot be done… if there is none, there is nothing that can be done; this is the only major reason for the weakness of the Chinese people. The importance of public entertainment buildings has been described in general above; now let's talk about the facilities of public entertainment buildings.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about parks. According to parks, they can be divided into two types… 1. Natural parks outside the city. 2. Parks in the city. The natural park outside the city is formed by decorating the places with trees or mountains and rivers that are about two or three miles away from the city. This is created by using natural scenery. This kind of park only needs to buy several mountains and forests, and then build several roads leading to the city, so the cost is relatively saved. However, the construction of this type of park must be close to the city… If there is no such natural scenery around the city, then, of course, this type of park is not suitable, and the second type of park in the city must be built. …As Shanghai is of course suitable for the second type, because there is no such natural original scenery nearby…</p>
<p>Parks in the city are completely built artificially. They must meet the conditions of art in order to make tourists interested; however, these parks in the city can be divided into two categories… (A) Man-made large lawn. Various trees are planted around, and遊椅 are set up to provide tourists with leisure and pleasure; and exotic flowers and plants are planted in it to arouse the curiosity of those who pass the time and create aesthetic ideas. This kind of small park should be built in prosperous trading areas, and the more the better. (For example, the Hubin Park on the side of West Lake in Hangzhou is a very good example). (B) Man-made parks in the city. This kind of park is larger than the lawn park. Flowers, trees, and seats are of course necessary; and there are rockeries, pavilions, and small lakes in it. In addition, various public entertainment buildings such as tennis, football fields, swimming pools, dance halls, small golf courses, and various</p>
<p>A photograph of the cork planted by the New Silk Forest Yong'an Forest Company fifteen years later. The trunk is five feet eight inches in circumference and about seventy-five feet high, which is beneficial to the display of citizens. (For example, the Confucius Temple Park in Shanghai and various parks in the concession are several good examples). At least two of this kind of park must be built in each city. And it is especially suitable to promote in the inland, and more should be established. Because the land in the inland is of course cheaper than the city, and there are more hard-working compatriots and farmers in the inland, and the knowledge is low, so it is more necessary to promote high-level entertainment to adjust the boring and tasteless life of the general public. This is a very important thing, which has a great impact on the future of the country! How can we ignore it?</p>
<p>Game fields and theaters are also one of the public entertainment buildings, but one is of a business nature, and the other is a private building, so there is no need for the public to build it, but only to guide and guide it. But when we plan the city, we should divide the land for private buildings so as not to confuse it with other boundaries. For example, there should be no theaters in the factory area. In the commercial area, more public entertainment places such as theaters can be set up to help the development of business. In the residential area, more theaters should also be set up to provide residents with proper entertainment. These are what we must pay attention to in the construction of city planning.</p>
<p>In addition, the construction of public sports fields, gyms, etc. is also indispensable; whether it is a city, town, township, or village, they must be established. Because this is the center of people's sports and an indispensable tool for entertainment! According to the school sports fields in Europe and the United States, people and children are allowed to enter freely to exercise, but our China is indeed the opposite, so the schools are inevitably aristocratic, because people cannot easily enter to exercise! But I sincerely hope that the school authorities will be aware of this and freely open the playground to benefit the citizens. Otherwise, more public sports fields should be set up in the city, no matter how big or small, but always in proportion to the number of people, children, women, and others in the city, and according to this distribution, each should be built separately; this is of great importance to the health of the citizens, and how can we ignore it!</p>
<p>In short, the facilities and methods of public entertainment buildings must meet the following five conditions!</p>
<p>1.  The facilities for public entertainment must be perfect, especially paying special attention to children and women.</p>
<p>2.  The address must be located in the central location of the city, and the transportation should be especially convenient.</p>
<p>3.  Do not take money丨Even if you take money, you should take the minimum fee.</p>
<p>4.  It must meet the needs of the masses, but it must not cater to the low-level evil psychology of society.</p>
<p>5.  Hire appropriate personnel to guide and supervise at any time.</p>
<p>Build it! Let us strive to build public entertainment buildings!</p>

<h3 id="e244">Overview of New Zealand Yong'an Forest Company <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>New Zealand is the world's most productive pine-producing area. The growth rate of softwood trees there is about four or five times that of those produced in Canada or Europe. For example, the Pinuslnsignis pine tree can be harvested in only ten to fourteen years for the production of wood pulp, and new trees can be planted the following year after harvesting. The organization of New Zealand Yong'an Forest Company is to make full use of this natural resort to seek the full development of the forest industry. In 1924, the company opened up 53,805 acres of land in a superior location with convenient transportation, and its afforestation area was 9,733 acres. By 1926, it had increased to 449 cais and two acres. As of today, its planting area, including the 6,000 acres to be planted, has reached a total of 144,600 acres, and no less than 100 million trees have been planted. It is estimated that it can be harvested within four years, so the abundance of its profits can be imagined. The company has complete equipment and a magnificent scale, and its future development is truly immeasurable. It is reported that the company welcomes investment from all walks of life to share the profits in order to actively expand.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Bridge Construction and Falsework <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Erming</p>
<p>The construction method of a bridge on a bridge site can vary depending on the circumstances of the bridge and local convenience, and can be divided into two types: using falsework and not using falsework.</p>
<p>For ordinary steel frame bridge construction, if falsework can be erected locally, it is advisable to use falsework. For stone arch bridges and three-in-one soil arch bridges that require continuous supports, falsework must also be erected. Whether or not to erect falsework depends on whether piles can be driven into the riverbed, whether navigation is obstructed, whether there are difficulties during flood season, whether the river is very deep, and whether there are wooden rafts and ice floes drifting on the river surface.</p>
<p>Ordinary single-track steel frame bridge construction is suitable for falsework. Each frame consists of four wooden piles. One frame is used under each connection point of the frame beam bridge, and several frames are used between the connection points. The width of the frame must be such that, outside the position of the steel bridge frame beam on both sides, steel rails can still be installed, one on each side, for the use of cranes traveling on them. The crane is an inverted U-shaped frame that can lift various parts of the bridge, travel on the two rails, and place them in appropriate locations. This type of crane is very suitable for bridges with spans of 250 feet or more. For shorter bridges, mobile cranes can be dispensed with and internal traveling cranes can be used. As for the order of constructing steel frame bridges, the rail-bearing beams and transverse dyes are usually installed first, followed by the two main frames. However, in order to avoid river flooding and the collapse of falsework, and to complete the main frame beams in a relatively short time, the above order can be changed. The construction of falsework required for stone arch bridges or three-in-one soil arch bridges is more important and difficult than that for ordinary frame beam bridges. Firstly, arch-shaped frames are more difficult to make; secondly, arch bridges are subject to heavy loads, unlike frame beam bridges where the load is concentrated at the connection points. Therefore, arch bridge falsework must have continuous support, and special care must be taken when removing the falsework upon completion, ensuring that each part slowly detaches simultaneously, so that each part of the bridge receives pressure at the same time.</p>
<p>Method of Not Using Falsework If the river conditions do not allow for the construction of falsework, the bridge body can be loaded onto several ships elsewhere, towed to the bridge site, and then moved onto the piers. Although this may obstruct traffic for some time, it is a simple solution from the perspective of bridge construction.</p>
<p>If the river does not allow for falsework and it is inconvenient to move ships, then the cantilever method is the simplest construction method. This method involves building from both banks, gradually extending towards the center, and then joining the two halves together when they meet. However, even if it is not a cantilever bridge, but the cantilever method is used for construction, the stress of each part of the bridge during construction must be calculated separately. Some of the stresses may be opposite and cancel each other out from the original stress, while others may be the same and merge together. In this case, the materials must be increased appropriately. This is the uneconomical aspect of the cantilever method, but due to its simplicity, in addition to cantilever bridges themselves, other ordinary bridges and arch bridges are also often built using this method.</p>
<p>The method of not using falsework can also be mixed and used in conjunction with the falsework method. For example, for a long bridge with several spans, the falsework method can be used where possible, and the cantilever method can be used where appropriate, depending on the local conditions.</p>
<p>The construction of ordinary slab bridges generally does not require falsework; only cranes are needed to lift them from one bank and place them in the appropriate position.</p>
<p>The construction of bridges requires skilled workers and good tools in order to be fast and cost-effective. Which of the above construction methods is applicable sometimes depends on the availability of these skilled workers and good tools. If these two conveniences are lacking, it will be very costly to operate.</p>
