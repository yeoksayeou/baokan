<h3 id="c1">美國沉默與日本積極備戰 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>美國之遠東政策原有其傳統的歷史關係即「門戶開放」「機會均等」是也自日本以武力佔領我東北三省之後在我國三百七十六萬七千七百方里地面悉被蹂躪三千萬人民任其宰割誠爲伊古以來未有之奇恥大辱而國際間美國爲尤甚者更痛感市場之被割裂是故美國國務長官史汀生特提出其主張表示美國之意見</p>
<p>一維持九國公約與非戰公約</p>
<p>二堅決的不承認以武力所取得之領土　　換言之即否定九一八以後日本軍國主義者在東三省區域之一切軍事行動然而否定亦僅止於否定由不快而至於憤怒亦不過憤怒而已豈能少遏日本之軍事的侵略野心哉故紐約華爾街銀行家與夫一般領袖人物以爲史汀生政策因日本之強暴已陷於失敗境地一則美國海軍比較軟弱難於在西太平洋上對日作戰再則目下經濟恐慌尚未回復原狀本年度預算不足竟達十六萬萬美金於是美國一般人士乃不能不表示消極國務院方面因此之故更不能不緘默乃暗中企圖與英法合作先使日本陷於外交上之孤立然後再進而以國際合作形式以打破日本之「大亞細亞門羅主義」目前之暫時沉默者殆自蓄其勢以待機焉耳</p>
<p>日本際此時會早已自知其弱點所在萬難與任何國家作長期持久之戰爭其軍事實力其國民經濟力及其國民之愛國狂熱均利在速戰茍一戰而領有菲列濱關島則中國市場將爲彼所獨占故肆力挑釁以圖一逞也期月以來其國內農村經濟恐慌及一般中小工商業者皆因此而愈陷於絕地乃迫其在外交上略示讓步而實際則來年度軍費竟成爲戰時預算（超過總預算額百分之五十）近且在佐世保海軍工廠新建造一潛水艇艦計排水量一千六百三十八噸速力水面十九浬水中十浬馬力六千四·七吋砲一門二十一吋魚雷發射管六隻海上續航力一萬零六十浬將於兩年之後完工此爲同於伊號第六四級之優秀艦艇日本此種同級潛水艦已有十五隻再加二等潛水艦其隻數總計五十九隻其器械新銳實堪居當今世界第一英美兩國皆當自愧其腐朽也</p>
<p>蓋潛水艦可潛行於海水中巧避敵人眼目遠之可以偵探敵方消息伺察敵方行動近之可以擔任近海之哨戒監視敵方之來窺且又能偷越警戒綫至於敵方近海威脅敵人之戰鬥實力演出種種神出鬼沒之詭計歐戰中之德國潛艇亦曾攻擊商輪活躍於海上然而潛水艦之任務尤不止此其攻擊最大目標乃在於海上之活動砲台無畏式大戰艦也日本現有之潛水艦艇如欲越渡太平洋而東以襲擊美海軍第一線夏威夷之珍珠港在勢在理皆不可能然而封鎖東海之線使美利堅聯合艦隊不能在西太平洋活動則頗有餘裕是故在美國不肯應戰日本乃得而任情挑衅也</p>
<p>日本旣如此積極備戰美國雖力戒輕率而軍備之擴張亦未肯相讓况其國民之富力智力皆較日本爲優不過美國現已取得世界上經濟的領導地位英法對之儘多不快是以美國之敵實不止日本一國於是乃不能不作比較週密之準備且更具有採取攻擊之决心縱非存亡必死之戰鬥而遠東市塲之發展匪特有關於美國之繁榮且於整個資本主義前途亦有興廢聯繫故乃不得不蓄其全力以圖太平洋上之制霸近年以來每露骨的演習攻擊某所之戰爭每年每月反復實習大西洋艦隊長留太平洋不歸回原隊雖警備性質大過挑戰意識其形勢之緊張可以槪見日本方面更將不顧一切盲目備戰（現時對東北問題表示可以開放乃暫時權宜之計以調和英法對日關係耳）美國一般人士對太平洋西岸之中國問題東三省之強占華北之受威脅致對華貿易蒙受莫大不良影響亦以其內部矛盾而暫時容忍表示消極所謂史汀生政策失敗者不過表面略爲沉寂且歷來史汀生即未積極過問遠東甚至未常準備積極過問也現時之沉寂爲總統大選將屆使然亦世界正醞釀新變化使然美國又非以「戰爭」立國者故雖不免於備戰而武力未充實財源方枯渴之際必將爲十分審愼之考慮此「金人」合衆國之素習則所謂態度消極者亦正其宜也吾國失地受辱於今爲烈寗能長遠依附國際間之喜怒瞻仰「美人」顏色而不亟圖自救耶要電</p>

<p>利用日美對抗形勢爲要挾地步</p>
<p>一方面盡力助長中國共黨勢力</p>
<p>從能相安一時俄日戰事終不免</p>
<p>國民社二十三日東京電、此間觀察外交者以爲蘇俄遠東政策、今已愈益顯然、含有下列諸點、（一）莫斯科將力求祛除日本對俄之疑忌、同時煽導日本疑忌他國、尤其疑忌美國、日前伊斯維斯的亞報主筆雷台克著文、力言一旦美日發生糾紛時蘇俄將完全中立、並由塔斯通訊社將此文電達日本廣事宣傳、即其一證、（二）蘇俄旣煽導日本軍閥及人民疑忌美國、同時又繼續盡力援助中國共產黨、希望將來共黨在華得勢後與俄合作、（三）繼續在美鼓吹反對日本媾成日美之爭、坐收漁人之利、（四）此時一方面向美國表示、倘美國仍不承認蘇俄、則俄將被迫至少暗中與日合作、另一方面則向日本表示、倘東京不尊重蘇俄在北滿之利益與權利、及中東路所有權、則蘇俄將被迫贊助美國之不承認武力取得領土計劃、連不承認「滿洲國」在內、蓋利用日閏　抗形勢爲要挾地步、其運用之巧妙　　　爲世界一等外交手段、宜其獲得鉅大成功也、至去冬日軍進向北滿時、蘇俄立集三十萬大軍於滿邊附近者、此間外交家僉謂俄政府此種軍事行動、純爲自保起見、深恐一旦發生意外局勢、致日軍侵入蘇境故也、今則此種恐懼已暫時消失、故俄軍亦已撤回一部份、惟毘連滿洲一帶所駐兵力固已大增於前、料今後仍將保持充分實力、使日軍中冒險軍人不致生覬覦俄土之心、又自去年東北事變發生以來、蘇俄外交能獲如此成功者半、亦由於駐日大使特羅揚諾斯基之力、特氏不拘外交常例、往往直接訪陸相荒　質詢一切、交換意見、顯曾使日本參謀部相信蘇俄不致干涉日本在滿計劃、遂使當初日俄間一觸即發之緊張局勢、漸爲之緩和、雖然蘇俄此種遠東政策之背景、即爲其實業計劃、日人之諳悉國際情形者、皆信蘇俄俟實業計劃完成、自覺實力可與日軍相抗後、即將大變其態度、日本某外交家曾云、日俄俱欲爭霸亞洲、爲將來無可逃免之事實、兩政府之性質、實使其不能成立長久之友誼、兩國間遲早必有一國退居第二位、而此恐則非武力不能解决者云、</p>
<p>日對俄締不侵約</p>
<p>贊否兩派抗爭</p>
<p>日皇如廣田聽取蘇聯國情</p>
<p>華聯社二十四日東京電日外交部對俄政策、依然在徬徨中、分兩派抗爭、關於俄日不侵犯約、造成與反對仍是對立、贊成不侵犯條約論者謂（一）反對簽訂不侵犯條約論者有兩種錯誤、一則國際關係與國內情形不能分明、二則視第三國際之赤化宣傳、爲蘇俄政府之行爲、因此生出意外之恐怖心、（二）俄日邦交現時親善、故用不到不侵犯條約、但爲欲增進日俄之親善、俄國旣然願意簽訂、又有何妨、在歐州各國間另有不侵犯條約簽訂國甚多、（三）不能因俄日國體不同、就要拋棄日俄之親善、（四）俄羅之五年計劃、重要在軍用工業、固屬事實、但是俄國之軍備、不一定是專爲對付日本而準備、試看歐州各國之對俄關係、便可明白、（五）第三國際之共產主義宣傳、並非始於今日、不能以宣傳共產主義而反對不侵犯條約、日本雖盡力壓迫、但共產黨之活動依然猛烈、原來赤化宣傳是屬國內之政治問題、而且欲防止赤化、須由施善政做起、補救國內之政治組織與經濟組織之缺點、欲藉國際條約制止、可謂認識不充足、（六）俄日「滿」三國同盟若以上列理由進行固無不可、以我國之實力制止外力、方能稱爲有性命之外交、日本不必過懼蘇俄、俄國如有軍事準備、則我亦以十足軍備應付、必不過於驚心、反對簽訂不侵犯條約方面謂：（一）俄日雙方本無侵犯對手國之領土、何必簽訂不侵犯條約、俄國所以深望斯約者、蓋爲俄國抱有侵略日本之意、亦未可知、（二）世界已有非戰公約、何必現畫蛇添足、（三）俄日國體根本不能相容、（四）恐因有不侵犯條約、國民對於國防之思想有稍鬆懈、不講軍備、（五）俄國之五年計劃以軍用工業爲主、視日本爲敵、恐上其當、（六）俄國不尊重信義、依然在日本宣傳共產主義、恐因日俄親近、將助長國內之赤化運動、（七）日俄「滿」三國同盟、恐引誘共產勢力侵入「滿州國」、於日本之政策有許多不利、</p>
<p>電通社二十四日東京電齋藤首相昨在葉山發表可以締結日俄締結不侵犯條約之意見、外務省主腦部根據、（一）蘇俄政府對於第三國際、係在無責任地位、雖締結不侵犯條約、而思想的侵略、蘇俄政府係不保障、（一）現在之日俄關係、並無締結一般的不侵犯條約之必要、所必要者係經濟關係之具體的親善關係等之根本理由、以爲不侵犯條約之締結尚早、但有一於關東軍方面一時的及局部的不侵犯條約、則或不反對」之意思、若關於樺太或朝鮮國境如現日俄間所存在之軍事協定、締結包含「滿洲國」之日俄「滿」三國間、一時的且局部的不侵犯條約、似較爲適切、然是否由日方提議現尚未定、現外務與軍部皆在研究中、</p>

<p>— 景記</p>
<p>相老人正在照常的樣子，坐在靠椅上看看書丨這是白日莫閒過的好習慣！丨我敲門入室去報告了一些事。完了以後，相老人便說了，你看看這一篇的顏氏家訓罷！　　我應聲接過來了便讀，原來是講：南北朝時，做家長的，敎子弟學鮮卑話，彈胡琴，準備去伺候那入主中國的外族王公大人！我看了後，默默無言。　　相老人便又歎了『現在的中國子弟，也學會洋話，玩「萬華林」了！』我聽了，覺得有些很不安似的！相老人隨後又告訴了我，西洋的外交家，風俗更要不得說；了好些例。現述一趣事下文便是丨　　『巴黎的美酒·在倫敦去喝；反而要物美價廉：你想想個中的黑幕！許多讀書人，讀到走頭無路時，去投靠外交家：那大使或公使還得考察他的人品如何，眞有些學問沒有；結果，沒有好缺位置，就派他充門房。你想想，不是委曲人麼？不是的！　　因爲許多運到國外的大使館或公使館所有物件，例行免稅於是倫敦就可以喝物美價廉的巴黎酒了！本館喝不完時，門房等館役，就可分售些給本地方的上流紳士人家了！權充門房的窮書生，原來談吐可以交結來訪的紳士所以生活問題便解决了！　　這不過是運用所謂外交的手腕，做得了一件有趣的事。』</p>

<p>— 許茸餘</p>
<p>丨放下槍桿去握鋤頭丨</p>
<p>「勞動可以增進健康。」「勞心不及勞力的愉快。」這兩句慶眞是不錯！握慣筆桿的我，近來丟下筆桿，亦握起鋤頭來了。可是我握這鋤頭，並非眞欲學做老圃，卻有兩層道理　　第一點：「老當益壯」這一句話，是人人知道的：也是人人所希望的。年近不惑的我：平日靠筆桿過活的我，很少鍜鍊身體；和活動筋骨的機會，你倘使軋在少年伴中，練習些運動，「少所見·多所怪」·旁人一定會說你發神經病。借這鋤田的機會，很可以操練身體；強壯筋骨。　　第二點：「到鄉間去」這一句話，是人人高喊着的。可是都市生活的奢華，沉迷安逸，都使你不肯離去。我現在是到鄉間來了·倘使不握鋤頭，便不是真的鄉下人了。　　這兩層理由，我自己亦知道不十分澈底。不過握筆桿的我，雖無裨補於國家，却也無害於社會，現在是丟下筆桿了。倘使握槍桿的軍人，肯丟下槍桿，去握鋤頭，那倒是一件大大的喜事咧！　　講到握鋤頭，起初也有些苦楚。頭幾天手上起泡；過幾天四肢酸痛，等到手上的繭皮生了：四肢復原而舒服了、那時你握了鋤頭，揮動自如，倒比筆桿輕快得多咧！　　鋤頭下的收獲，總不外乎瓜荳菜蔬。勞力的結晶，自然比市售的新鮮名貴。出了若干身的汗，斗大的瓜；成簇的荳；甜嫩的菜，給你做根相當的報酬；那亦得値得的呀。　　鄉下握鋤頭的同志，渾渾噩噩，尚存古風，倒比握筆桿和槍桿的同志快樂得多了他們早上起來，到小茶館裏喝一開茶，講講山海經；晚上工作完畢，到小酒館喝幾開白酒，回到家裏，倒頭便睡，倒也很合「日出而作，日入而息」這兩句話兒。　　諸位閱者們！我並不是到了鄉下，便提倡鄉間的生活；拼命的做鄉村美妙的文章。實在鄉村的景色，多麼的有味，而且我國素來是「以農立國」的，不妨提倡提倡呀！</p>

<p>— 求幸福生</p>
<p>佟一貞說到最悲傷之處，直恨不得要縱聲大哭，魯伯勤郤屹立着似一尊石像一樣，竟出乎意外的有了斬截的回答：「這個，你不要悲傷，我立刻就能答復你。我是有了决心了，我們就此一同入關去罷。」這</p>
<p>時，佟一貞正撑著淚眼仰望著魯伯勤的面部，猛聴得這句痛快的話，喜得直笑來，又執著他的手臂細問：</p>
<p>「眞的嗎。不料你這人今天也有决斷了！但我還要問你，你們郵局人員入關，本已决定了有好幾天，前兩次談到這，你都還未肯鬆這句口，此刻怎麼會想到要這樣做的呢？」　　「一貞！你不早聽我說過，諸事要以你的幸福爲前提嗎？你若冒昧跟我走，實是與你無益，而且名譽上也太有損。以前那些危難，我以爲都尚有挽救的希望，不必亟亟行此下策。就是這一次我須離開你回內地去，雖萬分捨不得；但究還以爲你獨留在此地，當不致於絕對會有危險，也許到最後我仍能悄然而去；但今天這件事郤大大的不然了！這些要坑害你的人都似一　不可以理喻的野獸，擺在眼面前的又是最嚴重的人獸的關頭，我那能再躊躇一刻半刻，坐看你陷身到野獸羣中去？所以只有不計一切通常的利害，而不得不從權下此决心了」魯伯勤很沉毅的敘說他的理論。</p>
<p>「但是該怎樣走呢？」佟一貞仍須問個明白。　　「幸而事情也很凑巧；今天我也接到局中的消息，郵務長已奉到政府命令，决計封閉郵局，率同局中全體人員入關，日本也答應簽護照，可以搭乘他們那個奉山鐵路的火車，只消有了登車的日期，我們就秘密一同上車好了。」魯伯勤又有了更切近於事實的辦法。　　最後，佟一貞又想起伊一方面出走前種種的障礙，提出來與魯伯勤細籌如何應付？也定下了一條秘計。</p>

<h3 id="c90">唯名哲學 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>談到哲學會使你想起一大串派別上的名詞「一元」「二元」「多元」「唯物」「唯心」「唯情」等等獨獨沒有聽見過唯名哲學這一個名詞。這是過去史家的過失。實在這種學說流傳得非常之久遠崇奉。這種學說的人真是滔滔皆是。現在略述其梗槪以便後之編哲學史者有所參考。　　講到這種學說的淵源。因爲流傳久遠。文獻失徵。有人說創始於阿。A有人說發源於荀卿公孫龍之徒也。有人說成立於孔子。因爲他老人家曾著春秋而亂臣賊子懼而且說過「必也正名乎」的話頭。似乎比較近似。但孟軻曾說書經上武王伐紂。血流標杵的話的不可靠。則大槪。在三代之時已。有所謂新聞政策像。現在的電報戰一樣。可爲此種學說存在的佐證。總之古已有之於今爲烈則可斷言惟。其授受之跡則。頗涉渺茫且。留待有考據癖與歷史癖的先生們去考據吧。此處只好略而不談。　　其次。講到這種學說的好處。第一是。可以對付他人第二是。可以安慰自己。比方王小二受了李阿四的氣。恨在心頭。便在墻上畫了一隻烏龜。旁邊注上「李阿四隻小五車」幾個字。自己看看李阿四已眞的變成了小烏龜似的。於是氣也平了恨。也消了這件小糾紛就告結束。倘使王小二換了一個會寫文章的。那便提起筆來寫了一篇影射中傷的文章。對外發表。或是寫一封匿名信去恐嚇他一下。只要使對方受到些微的影響。自己的心願也就滿足了。不必實有其事。也不必定要眞刀眞槍去實現你所說的話。—那多夠費事。倘使你要去救國。那末你不妨先定一個綱領。再發一篇宣言。說救國應如何如何。外人看了贊嘆。自己讀讀也嘸啥。這時候倘你覺得餘氣未消。那你可以隨便喊聲口號。例如「打倒××。」「殺盡××。」「長期抵抗。」「誓死抗日。」之類。字面愈兇狠。聲調愈悲壯愈好。喊時不一定要到馬路上。在公館裏別墅中也行丨。講到舒氣的功用。喊口號與唱歌實具有同等的効力。所以講到這種學說的應用。實在至大無外。比方你家裏有小孩。晚上啼哭睡不着。那你可以用紅紙寫一條「天皇皇。地皇皇。…」貼到街上去。或是你患了重傷風。你也可以用同様」的方法寫一條「出賣重傷風。一見就成功」的條子。貼在厠所裏或是電桿木上。雖然你的小孩不一定就會睡得着。你的傷風也不一定就會好。但這至少你自己是得到安慰了。倘你是一個商人。那末。請你不要吝惜那些極犧牲的字眼。如「不顧血本。」「照本出售。」之類。你也不要顧慮你說得不像是一個商人。那是沒有人來提出質問的。更要善於利用「廉價。」「減價。」等等的名詞。從開幕大廉價到清理大出賣報紙上。口頭上儘管大廉特廉。一次二次。十週五週。决不會與你原有營利的目的相衝突。這是名的功用。再或有人非議你天天去看電影。你可以說娛樂不忘國難。你沒有兒子要討一個小老婆。你可以說「不孝有三無後爲大」嗚呼。名之爲用大矣哉。</p>

<p>— 熱心</p>
<p>一碗水，我們知道可以把牠分成兩碗。一滴水到分無可分的水，我們當然認爲這在水的名義上，是不能再分了。但是我們還可以用科學的方法，把這一滴水，分做兩種原子。原子不能再分嗎？不。每一個原子，都有一個核心和許多電子。當然，把原子再分成核心和一個個的電子，是可能的，現在我們把這世界上所有的一切物件，拿來一步一步的分析，最後的結果，沒有不歸到原子的核心和電子上面的，牠們在目前是被認爲構成這世界的最初的原質。　　假使我們拿電學來解釋，那麽，在每一個原子裏，其核心永遠荷着陽電；電子永遠荷着陰電。這創造全世界一切</p>
<p>物質的電子，牠們的形狀，牠們的特性，都是一樣的，這就是說金原子裏的電子和銀原子裏的電子，并不兩樣。不過兩種不同原子裏所含電子的數量，却大有出入了。以同樣的電子，會構成不同的原子，原因就在這上面。　　那么，電子在不同的原子裏，爲什麼數量不同呢？這却是因爲原子的核心所荷的陽電多寡不同的緣故。譬方說：甲原子核心所荷的陽電比乙原子多，牠需要的電子，因爲要求和其所荷的陽電均等，當然比乙原子所需要的多，如果一個原子因爲受了外力的壓迫而失掉牠固有的一部份電子，那麼，牠裏面核心所放的陽電，發生過剩。這過剩的陽電，</p>
<p>，便極力想吸引別處的電子，以保持牠原有的均勢。我們空閑的時候，偶然玩玩的一套把戲：拿一塊絹擦一面玻璃，等到玻璃發熱了，拿牠來吸引紙屑，原是這個道理。玻璃因爲受磨擦的結果，失去牠一部份的電子。紙屑裏面電子是有的。只是紙屑也不能放鬆，任電子呌玻璃吸走。所以是一面你拉，一面我扯，結果是質地輕的吃虧，紙屑連本身都被玻璃吸走了。</p>

<p>從上面所講的話設想假使我們現在用一種科學方法把許多荷有陽電的電子的核心關在一邊牠們都需要大量的電子和牠們拼合再把許多荷有陰電的電子關在另一邊牠們都期待着一件領導牠們的東西使牠們有歸宿的地方當我們把這樣兩邊接在一起的時候每一個電子都爭先恐後的向核心跑每一個核心都很命的吸收電子一陣激烈的變動當然免不了非等到關電子一邊的電子都跑光了這激烈的變動是不會停止的我們通常用的電池當牠有通電的作用的時候便是這個道理但是對於電的解釋在電子沒有發明之先已有電流一說科學家拿水來做譬喻以爲電流是由陽極流到陰極正和水由高地流到低地一樣這個解釋當然除掉附會之外並無別的根據不過科學家沿用這個解釋已經很久許多定則都根據這解釋做立足點已經沒有法子廢止所以現在電學上有一件極可笑的矛盾的事實便是電流從陽極流到陰極電子從陰極流到陽極但這事實雖然可笑我們研究起來的時候却要常把牠擺在心上呢</p>

<p>— 汝立</p>
<p>「打花會九個銅板賠一元運氣好時打一塊錢可得三十多元這是多麼好的事呀」幾個着短衫的人在那老虎灶的茶桌上津津有味的談着這時有個做小工的阿四坐在旁邊聽得發呆了心裏想這件事到可使得像我做小工一天到晚忙個要死不過賺個幾毛錢那裏有發財的日子啦馬上就站起身來連忙跑到一條小巷的破而且矮茅屋裏打花會去了回到家裏快樂得什麼似的不住的笑着對他妻子說「我們馬上要發財了今天可得三十多塊錢」</p>
<p>到了天夕花會開了阿四忙忙跑着去對字碼那知沒有打着阿四竟呆了開花會的人對他說「一次不得沒有甚麼希奇你連打幾次包你就得着」阿四聽得心花怒放面呈笑容又在破而垢黑的衣服袋裏摸了一塊錢打上一門從此他把本來做小工的事業也就放棄了每天吃飯睡覺腦袋裏祗默念着打「明珠」好還是「必得」好呢有時夢中嘆語我得着了我發財了阿四前後統共打了幾十次次次都落着空前不多天他忽然瘋了一人大聲呌喊道「我老是這樣的不能打着花會怎麼好呢家中錢倒被我打完了衣服也被我當光了我聽說只有拿人頭來托夢是多准確的」但那裏來的人頭呢於是乎他瘋得更利害了他竟不知道一切的一切他跑到廚房裏拿着菜刀眞的要殺人了現在被巡捕捉到巡捕房裏去了妻子做成乞丐了</p>
<p>唉諸君上面的確一段事實不是我瞎說現在我要鄭重和親愛的同胞們說幾句：要曉得花會的字碼有三十多門三十多門只開一門內中還有黑幕你到那裏去得呢拿了血汗的金錢去打花會如同以劍自刎凡是種了花會毒的人終歸是妻離子散甚至於自殺可憐不可憐醒醒罷不要做黃金夢了做我正當的事業過我愉快的生活</p>

<p>Zhang Dianjiu's Troops Determined to Retake Fularji</p>
<p>Volunteer Army Destroys Half a Li of South Manchuria Railway Tracks</p>
<p>After Contacting Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen in Heilongjiang Province, Beiping Plots to Advance; Tang Juwu's Troops in Liaodong Have Recaptured Twenty Lost Counties; Volunteer Armies in Other Areas are All Fighting Hard; Although the Japanese Side Has Increased Troops, They are All Exhausted from Running Around; Japanese Army Units on the Taonan-Jehol Line Have Been Transferred North and South to Participate in Attacks on Ma and Tang's Armies; This Line is Extremely Empty; The Japanese Side is Buying Off More Than 2,000 Mongolian Bandits in the Tongliao Qianjiadian Area, Changing Them into Japanese Uniforms and Sending Them to the Taonan Line to Station and Defend Against Volunteer Army Ambush (24th Dispatch) The Volunteer Army Destroys the South Manchuria Railway Main Line</p>
<p>Beiping: More than 400 Volunteer Army soldiers under the overall commander Lü Jingxin plotted to destroy the South Manchuria Railway's main line between Tieling and Kaiyuan, secretly cutting off half a li of railway tracks, but were detected by the Japanese army, which dispatched armored vehicles to repel the Volunteer Army. The damaged railway tracks were repaired by Japanese soldiers. Train service on the main line was suspended, and it arrived in Changchun four hours late at Liaoyang (24th Dispatch).</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Reconnoiter Japanese Residents in Northern Manchuria</p>
<p>Beiping: Five Japanese reconnaissance planes flew to Angangxi, Zhalantun, Hailar and other places on the morning of the 22nd to reconnoiter the whereabouts of the 600 Japanese residents captured by Su Bingwen's troops and dropped leaflets urging them to release the Japanese residents quickly, otherwise they would be severely attacked, etc. (24th Dispatch).</p>
<p>Weihaiwei False Police Transferred to Changchun</p>
<p>Beiping: More than 80 false police from Weihaiwei, led by police officer Kim Chung-hyun, a Korean, were transferred to Changchun yesterday by the Japanese side because the false police had repeatedly caused trouble. Another group of false border police was sent to Weihaiwei, increasing the number to 120 (14th Dispatch). The Volunteer Army Briefly Enters Xinmin City Beiping: About 2,000 Volunteer Army soldiers under Geng Jizhou attacked Xinmin County on the 17th in separate groups, engaging in fierce fighting with more than 500 Japanese soldiers. We attacked in four routes: the first route led by Zhang Zi'an from Changgouyan east of the city, the second route by He Xichen from Balipu south of the city, and the third and fourth routes by Li Shengjiu from Baqipu on the northwest sides of the city. After two hours of fierce fighting, we attacked and entered the south gate, destroying the power plant, extinguishing all the lights, and disrupting order. After two hours of chaotic fighting, the Japanese army fled outside the city, and our army occupied it, killing more than 30 enemies, capturing two machine guns and more than 20 rifles. Our army suffered more than 10 deaths and several injuries.

Soviet Russia Aided Japanese Residents in Northern Manchuria Moscow: Since the Soviet Russian government announced that it was prepared to allow Japanese residents in Manchuria to enter the country and then send them back to Japan, it is now learned that since General Su Bingwen revolted, Soviet Russia has been acting as an intermediary for the Japanese side. Japanese officials and people trapped in the Japanese consulate have been communicating with the Japanese government through the Russian consulate and have been receiving financial assistance from the Russian consulate. At the same time, the Russian consul has also begun to contact General Su to release the Japanese. According to news here, General Su has agreed to allow Japanese civilians to leave the country, but there are another 126 Japanese people in Manchuria, only 10 of whom are civilians, and the rest are officials of the false organization. General Su has not yet agreed to release these Japanese people. According to recent news from the Japanese government, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet decided whether to accept the method of only allowing civilians to leave the country or whether it wants all the Japanese people to leave the country. According to the Japanese consulate in Manchuria, there are currently 158 Japanese people seeking refuge, including 33 men and the rest women and children (23rd National News Agency Dispatch).</p>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet Russian consul in Manchuria has negotiated with Su Bingwen to request the rescue of 158 Japanese people seeking refuge in the Japanese consulate, to be returned to Japan via Russia. Su only agreed to release private citizens and not officials or soldiers. It is reported that in addition to the above-mentioned people in Manchuria, there are still 126 Japanese people being detained separately, most of whom are officials of the "Manchukuo" and those related to government offices. There are only about 10 purely private citizens. Japanese foreign affairs authorities are very doubtful whether they will agree to only rescue private citizens. It seems that the good offices of the Russian officials will not be completed quickly. Also, of the Japanese seeking refuge in Manchuria, only 33 are men, and the rest are women and children (23rd Electric Communication Agency Dispatch).</p>

<p>Volunteer Army Spread Throughout Outskirts of Shenyang</p>
<p>Beiping: People coming from Shenyang talked about how volunteer armies are found in the villages 20 to 30 li around Shenyang City, such as Hunhepu in southern Shenyang, Laohutai in eastern Shenyang, Ertaizi in northern Shenyang, and Masanjiazi in western Shenyang. They take the opportunity to attack Shenyang City, often clashing with the Japanese army at night. The Japanese are quite distressed by this. Defensive works have been built at the border gates, and special police are stationed day and night. However, the people are thinking of the Han Chinese, and many of the false police are in contact with the Volunteer Army and may mutiny at any time. Residents near Shenyang are extremely afraid and are moving to the industrial area. Many of the houses outside the Xiaobeimen Tuncai and Dadongbianmen in the northern market and the Daxiao Nanguan are uninhabited. The Japanese army in Shenyang has fewer than a thousand soldiers and has blocked Xiaobeimen to facilitate defense. A new airport has been built west of Fengyong University with only four planes. Because the Japanese army is weak, it is spreading many rumors in the newspapers, falsely increasing the number of troops. At the same time, armored vehicles, cars, artillery vehicles, and planes are sent out every day to show their power, which only shows their timidity (24th Dispatch).</p>

According to them, there have been four major battles since the start of the anti-Japanese resistance in Rehe. In the second major battle, the Japanese army came with more than 4,000 men and colluded with Dong bandits to attack from both sides. Fortunately, our soldiers and officers fought bravely and repelled them one after another, capturing many prisoners. Currently, the Japanese troops stationed in the Chaoyang and Taonan areas of Liaoning are attacking our Chaoyang and Kailu from time to time with varying numbers of troops. Contact has been made repeatedly, and fighting has stopped repeatedly. There are two brigades on the front line of our army fighting against the Japanese, all of which are the most elite units of the Rehe army. Dong Futing is stationed in Chaoyang, and Zhai Xingwu's brigade is stationed in Kailu. As far as the army is concerned, the Rehe army can barely resist the Japanese army, but Japanese planes come in groups to drop bombs and destroy things, and our army has no anti-aircraft equipment at all, resulting in great losses. This time, they are requesting national defense funds from the central government and hoping that the people of the whole country will rise up to save Rehe in order to consolidate the barrier of the Central Plains (24th Dispatch).</p>

<p>Shandong Provincial Government All Committee Members</p>
<p>Telegraph to Request Redetermination of Measures Against Liu</p>
<p>Expressing Dissent to the Central Government's Allocation of Five Counties of Defense Territory to Liu's Army</p>
<p>External News: Korean Army Occupies Muping and Seems Poised to Capture Perilous Qixia Mountain</p>
<p>He Yingqin Indicates that Korean Army Must First Withdraw to Original Defense</p>
<p>Jinan: All committee members and the secretary-general of the Shandong Provincial Government telegraphed Lin, Song, Jiang, and Zhang, saying: "To the Chairman of the Nanjing National Government, Lin, Acting President of the Executive Yuan, Song, Commander-in-Chief of Hankou, Jiang, and Acting Chairman of the Beiping Military Affairs Committee Branch, Zhang: Chairman Han recently expressed deep regret that he could not alleviate the suffering of the people and that he felt overwhelmed by the heavy responsibility. He has telegraphed to resign, and we should advance and retreat together. However, we, the members of the Provincial Government, have seen something and dare not remain silent. We respectfully report to you. We have investigated and found that Liu Zhennian has entrenched himself in Jiaodong, extorting and plundering, and disregarding national discipline. The facts are clear. Chairman Han, due to his official duties and concern for the people, has already confined Liu's remnants to Laiyang and Ye counties. The central government may not understand the truth and has not issued a clear order to suppress him. The military department may think that the problem is too big and is discussing troop transfers. However, Liu Zhennian is using the excuse of a division telegram to boast and is not only not leaving Shandong, but is expanding to the five counties, restoring the Yantai-Longkou defense line. If the status quo is maintained like this, how can we comfort the eager appeals of the people? Moreover, with Liu Zhennian's tyranny and past interference in administration, he has been unrestrained. Now that he is defending with troops, his arrogance is increasing. Although the military department has sent a telegram of reprimand, administrative officials with no weapons in the face of overwhelming pressure are afraid that it cannot be guaranteed by a piece of paper. We believe that the land and people of Shandong belong to the rule of the country. The central government should treat everyone equally, and the provincial government should not be permanently divided. Since the Northeast Incident last year, Shandong has been in a special situation, and there have been times of great danger. We have been exhausted in emergencies and have often been at a loss for what to do. We hope that you will understand the various unspeakable secrets. Now that the situation in North China is still under the threat of strong enemies, Shandong is even more vulnerable to excuses. A slight tremor will lead to a major change. In the past two days, the people have been restless, as if they cannot last until the end of the day. We are afraid of the future and dare to risk stating our views. We earnestly request that you observe public opinion and make a prompt decision to quickly decide on a solution that can resolve the matter fairly, stabilize people's hearts, and eliminate hidden dangers. We know that our limited knowledge is of no help, but because we have received the central government's mandate, we dare not hesitate and avoid suspicion at this time of great danger, and we dare not mislead the country and bring disaster to the local area. The Minister of Civil Affairs of the Shandong Provincial Government, Li Shuchun, the Minister of Finance, Wang Xiangrong, the Minister of Construction, Zhang Honglie, the Minister of Education, He Siyuan, the Minister of Industry, Wang Fangting, the member Zhang Yue, and the Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang, respectfully bow."

<p>Rumors in Hankou that Jiang Plans to Send Zhang Fang to Mediate the Shandong Situation (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Song Ziwen has telegraphed to comfort Han Fuju, who has resigned as Chairman of Shandong. According to He Yingqin, the central government is determined to retain Han. After discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting, a telegram was sent to retain him. As for the Han-Liu dispute, it can be easily resolved if both parties obey the central government's orders and maintain their original defenses. However, the two sides are still facing each other, and there will be no major battles in the Sichuan situation (24th Central News Agency Dispatch). Nanjing: He Yingqin met with Tang Xiang, the representative of Han Fuju, on the 24th and inquired about the reasons for Han's resignation in Shandong. Tang also reported on Han's intention to resign. The resolution of the Jiaodong issue is currently being discussed by Chairman Jiang and He via telegram. He Yingqin talked about the issue of transferring Liu's troops because Liu's troops are still surrounded, so even if the central government orders them to transfer, there is no way out. Therefore, the Korean army must first withdraw to its original defense before discussing the transfer of Liu's troops or seeking another solution (24th Dispatch).</p>
<p>Nanjing: Liu Zhennian telegraphed his representative in Beijing, saying, "My division has long obeyed Minister He's instructions and is waiting for a peaceful resolution. The Korean army's recent attacks on Ye County have become more urgent, and it seems that it will not obey the order before the 28th. We request that the central government quickly make a thorough solution." (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jinan, Shahe: Yesterday, Liu's army fired more than 300 cannons from inside Ye County at the three sides outside the city, south, west, and north, non-stop all day.

<p>Jinan: Yesterday, eight soldiers of Liu's army, carrying large guns, surrendered to the provincial army, saying that there was a shortage of food in the city. In the past, each company of soldiers was issued two bags of flour per day, but now it has been reduced by half and still cannot last. It will be reduced again, and the soldiers are complaining and want to escape. The others escaped when the leaders gathered to gamble. The army in the city is very scattered, and there are often small disturbances. The soldiers and civilians are panicked and there are many fires. Yesterday, there was a big fire 18 li from the city, which could be seen from behind the Haimiao Temple (24th Dispatch).</p>
<p>Yantai: Several foreign newspapers reported that the Korean army in Shandong had occupied the Weihaiwei district. The Weihaiwei Chinese authorities have denied this, saying that only the Marines are stationed in Weihaiwei. There has been no confirmation here of the rumors that the Korean army bombarded Laizhou. However, heavy artillery and field artillery were transported to Laizhou from Jinan at the end of last week. The Korean army has now completely occupied Muping and is expected to concentrate its efforts to capture the perilous Qixia Mountain. The troops in the area will then join other provincial troops near Laiyang and launch a general offensive against Laiyang. It is widely believed that Liu Zhennian is still in Laizhou and that the city is completely surrounded (24th Reuters Dispatch).</p>
<p>Hankou: Liu Zhennian telegraphed Jiang on the 22nd and 23rd, saying that the Korean troops were forcibly requisitioning grain and food in the villages around Ye County and sending planes to bomb Ye County. They were also using various types of cannons to bombard Ye County, causing casualties to the people and destroying many houses. They were also condoning the Communists to riot in Rizhao, with thousands of farmers joining in. He asked Jiang to order Han to stop military actions and to send senior officials to monitor the actions of both parties so that the central government could thoroughly implement the orders (24th Dispatch).</p>
<p>Beiping: Han Fuju telegraphed Beiping today, saying that there was no political solution and his intention to resign was very firm. Zhang Shaotang telegraphed, stating that Han resigned because there was no political solution. The Jiaodong issue can only be resolved by transferring Liu away from Shandong. Han's representative, Liu Xizhong, visited Zhang last night and visited Jiang Bocheng this morning to discuss everything. Jiang Bocheng is running around to mediate and will go to Jinan to meet with Han after a solution is found to resolve the Shandong issue as soon as possible (24th Dispatch).</p>

<p>Nanjing: A certain agency received a telegram from Chengdu stating that Liu Wenhui had made preparations to retreat into Xikang.

<p>Nanjing: Dai Chuanxian visited He Yingqin on the 24th to earnestly discuss ways to eliminate the Sichuan war and will telegraph Jiang to seek his consent.

<p>Nanjing: A telegram from Chongqing stated that the armies elected Liu Xiang as the Director-General of Pacification of Sichuan and Kang. Liu stated in the telegram to the generals that since the central government hopes for a peaceful resolution of the Sichuan affairs, the outlines of governing Sichuan and the Suining meeting should be realized. If Liu Wenhui does not advance his troops again, the armies should remain silent.

The government has strongly supported this proposal. Due to financial reasons, the first step is to send commercial commissioners to the four overseas embassies in the United States, England, Germany, and Japan.

<p>Xu Yongchang Talks About the Shanxi Situation</p>
<p>Actively Developing Industry and Engaging in Production</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Chairman of Shanxi, Xu Yongchang, came to Beijing from Hankou on the 22nd to visit various dignitaries and report on the Shanxi government. On the 24th, he talked to reporters about Shanxi's finances and construction, saying that there are a total of 100 regiments of guest troops in Shanxi Province, with approximately 40,000 to 50,000 soldiers. The monthly revenue of Shanxi and Suiyuan is 2 million taels of silver, and the expenses of the two provinces are 600,000. The monthly military expenditure is 1.4 million to 1.5 million, with a shortfall of more than 200,000. To remedy this, troops must be reduced. 10,000 to 20,000 troops have already been reduced. Shanxi's local autonomy is proceeding as usual. Shanxi's roads are sufficient and it is actively developing industry and engaging in production. Since taking office, I have been paying attention to this. This year, a Provincial Government Design Committee was specially established and Yan Baichuan was hired as the committee chairman. Experts were also hired to study, but the results are disappointing because domestic goods are difficult to compete with foreign goods. This is due to the high transportation tax rate and the inferiority of production machinery. The lack of political unity is responsible for 20%, the weakness of the country is responsible for 20%, and the lack of awareness among the people and the lack of cooperation among officials are responsible for 60%. Therefore, it is planned to first establish a support industry bank, hoping that the people will develop automatically and the government will provide rewards and assistance from the side. For example, Shanxi's coal cannot compete with foreign coal when transported out. The reasons for this are that the lack of political unity is responsible for 20%, the weakness of the country is responsible for 20%, and the lack of awareness among the people and the lack of cooperation among officials are responsible for 60%. Therefore, it is planned to first establish a support industry bank, hoping that the people will develop automatically and the government will provide rewards and assistance from the side (24th Central News Agency Dispatch).</p>

<h3 id="e2">American Silence and Japan's Active Military Preparations <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>America's Far East policy has traditionally been based on the historical principles of "Open Door" and "Equal Opportunity." Since Japan's military occupation of China's Northeast three provinces, our country's 3,767,700 square miles of land have been ravaged, and 30 million people are at their mercy. This is a great humiliation unprecedented in history. Among the international community, the United States in particular deeply feels the division of the market. Therefore, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson specifically put forward his position, expressing the U.S.'s opinion on:</p>
<p>One: Maintaining the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact.</p>
<p>Two: Firmly refusing to recognize territory acquired by force. In other words, denying all military actions of Japanese militarists in the Northeast provinces since September 18th. However, the denial is only a denial, and the displeasure only leads to anger. How can it curb Japan's military ambitions of aggression? Therefore, Wall Street bankers in New York and general leaders believe that the Stimson policy has failed due to Japan's violence. Firstly, the U.S. Navy is relatively weak and it is difficult to fight against Japan in the Western Pacific. Secondly, the economic panic has not yet recovered, and the budget for this year is insufficient, reaching 1.6 billion U.S. dollars. Therefore, the general public in the United States cannot help but express a passive attitude. For this reason, the State Department cannot help but remain silent, secretly attempting to cooperate with Britain and France to first isolate Japan diplomatically, and then further break Japan's "Greater East Asia Monroe Doctrine" through international cooperation. The current temporary silence is probably to accumulate strength and wait for an opportunity.</p>
<p>Japan, at this time, has already known its weaknesses. It is very difficult to wage a long-term war with any country. Its military strength, national economic power, and the patriotic fervor of its people all benefit from a swift battle. If it can occupy the Philippines and Guam in one battle, the Chinese market will be exclusively occupied by it. Therefore, it is vigorously provoking in an attempt to succeed. In the past month, the domestic rural economic panic and the general small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators have fallen into desperation because of this, forcing it to show slight concessions in diplomacy, but in reality, next year's military spending has become a wartime budget (exceeding 50% of the total budget). Recently, a new submarine is being built at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal, with a displacement of 1,638 tons, a speed of 19 knots on the surface, 10 knots underwater, 6,000 horsepower, one 4.7-inch gun, six 21-inch torpedo tubes, and a sea endurance of 10,060 nautical miles, which will be completed in two years. This is a ship equivalent to the I-64 class. Japan already has 15 submarines of this class, plus second-class submarines, the total number is 59. Its equipment is new and sharp, and it is truly the first in the world today. Britain and the United States should all be ashamed of their decay.</p>
<p>Submarines can sneak into the sea, cleverly avoiding the eyes of the enemy. From afar, they can detect enemy information and observe enemy actions. From close, they can serve as coastal patrols to monitor the enemy's intrusion, and they can also sneak through the alert line to the enemy's near seas, threatening the enemy's combat strength and performing all kinds of unpredictable tricks. German submarines in the European War also attacked merchant ships and were active at sea. However, the mission of submarines is more than this. Its biggest target of attack is the sea-based mobile fortress, the Dreadnought battleship. If Japan's existing submarines want to cross the Pacific Ocean and attack Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the front line of the U.S. Navy, it is impossible in terms of both momentum and logic. However, it has more than enough to block the line of the East China Sea, preventing the U.S. Fleet from operating in the Western Pacific. Therefore, because the United States is unwilling to fight, Japan is able to provoke at will.</p>
<p>Japan is so actively preparing for war, and although the United States is trying to avoid recklessness, it is unwilling to give way in the expansion of armaments. Moreover, its national wealth and intelligence are superior to Japan. However, the United States has now achieved economic leadership in the world, and Britain and France are largely displeased with it. Therefore, the enemy of the United States is not only Japan. Therefore, it cannot but make more comprehensive preparations, and it is more determined to take offensive actions. Even if it is not a battle of life and death, the development of the Far East market is not only related to the prosperity of the United States, but also to the rise and fall of the entire capitalist future. Therefore, it has to accumulate all its strength to dominate the Pacific. In recent years, it has openly conducted exercises to attack a certain place. The war is repeatedly practiced every year and every month. The Atlantic Fleet commander stays in the Pacific and does not return to the original team. Although the nature of the alert is greater than the sense of challenge, the tension of the situation can be seen. The Japanese side will prepare for war blindly regardless of everything (the current statement that the Northeast issue can be opened is only a temporary expedient to reconcile the relationship between Britain and France with Japan). The general public in the United States also temporarily tolerates and expresses a passive attitude towards the China issue on the west coast of the Pacific, the occupation of the three northeastern provinces, the threat to North China, and the great adverse effects on trade with China due to internal contradictions. The so-called failure of the Stimson policy is only a slight surface silence, and historically Stimson has never actively intervened in the Far East, and has not even prepared to actively intervene. The current silence is due to the upcoming presidential election, and also because the world is brewing new changes. The United States is not a country founded on "war," so although it cannot avoid preparing for war, it will definitely give very careful consideration when its military strength is not sufficient and financial resources are scarce. This is the habit of the "Golden Man" United States, so the so-called passive attitude is exactly what it should be. Our country has lost land and suffered humiliation to this day. How can we long rely on the joys and sorrows of the international community and look up to the "beauty's" countenance without trying to save ourselves?</p>

<p>Tokyo dispatch from the National News Agency, 23rd: Observers here believe that Soviet Russia's Far Eastern policy is becoming increasingly clear, containing the following points: (1) Moscow will strive to dispel Japan's suspicions of Russia while simultaneously inciting Japan to suspect other countries, especially the United States. As evidenced by the recent article by Mr. Ledeck, chief editor of Izvestia, forcefully stating that if a dispute occurs between the US and Japan, Soviet Russia will remain completely neutral. TASS subsequently transmitted this article to Japan for widespread publicity, as proof of their intention. (2) While inciting Japanese militarists and the people to suspect the United States, Soviet Russia also continues to vigorously assist the Chinese Communist Party, hoping that the CCP will gain power in China and cooperate with Russia in the future. (3) Continuing to promote anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States to create conflict between Japan and the US, reaping the benefits of the conflict. (4) At this time, on one hand, indicating to the United States that if the United States still does not recognize Soviet Russia, Russia will be forced to cooperate, at least secretly, with Japan. On the other hand, indicating to Japan that if Tokyo does not respect Soviet Russia's interests and rights in Northern Manchuria and the ownership of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Soviet Russia will be forced to support the US's plan to not recognize territorial gains by force, including the non-recognition of "Manchukuo." Its skillful use of the US-Japan confrontational situation as a bargaining chip is a top-tier diplomatic strategy in the world and is likely to achieve great success. Regarding the situation last winter when the Japanese army advanced towards Northern Manchuria, Soviet Russia immediately amassed 300,000 troops near the Manchurian border. Diplomatic figures here uniformly stated that the Russian government's military action was purely for self-preservation, deeply fearing that an unexpected situation would lead to the Japanese army invading Soviet territory. Now, this fear has temporarily disappeared, so the Russian army has also withdrawn a portion of its forces. However, the troop deployment in areas bordering Manchuria has significantly increased compared to before. It is expected that it will continue to maintain sufficient strength to prevent adventurous militarists in the Japanese army from harboring desires for Russian territory. Furthermore, since the Northeast Incident occurred last year, half of Soviet Russia's diplomatic success has been due to the efforts of Ambassador to Japan, Troyanovsky. Mr. Troyanovsky, disregarding diplomatic conventions, often directly visited Army Minister Araki to inquire about everything and exchange opinions. He apparently convinced the Japanese General Staff that Soviet Russia would not interfere with Japan's plans in Manchuria, thus gradually easing the tense situation between Japan and Russia that was on the verge of erupting. Although the background of Soviet Russia's Far Eastern policy is its industrial plan, those Japanese who are familiar with international affairs all believe that once Soviet Russia completes its industrial plan and feels its strength can compete with the Japanese army, it will greatly change its attitude. A certain Japanese diplomat once said that both Japan and Russia desire to dominate Asia, which is an unavoidable reality in the future. The nature of the two governments makes it impossible for them to establish a long-lasting friendship. Sooner or later, one of the two countries will have to take second place, and this matter can only be resolved by force.</p>
<p>Japan Considers a Non-Aggression Pact with Russia</p>
<p>Proponents and Opponents Clash</p>
<p>The Emperor Listens to Hirota's Account of the Soviet Situation</p>
<p>Tokyo dispatch from the China United News Agency, 24th: The Japanese Foreign Ministry's policy towards Russia remains in turmoil, with proponents and opponents clashing. Regarding a Russo-Japanese non-aggression pact, arguments for and against continue to stand in opposition. Those who support a non-aggression treaty argue: (1) Those who oppose signing a non-aggression treaty have two errors: Firstly, they fail to distinguish clearly between international relations and domestic conditions; secondly, they view the Comintern's communist propaganda as the actions of the Soviet Russian government, thus generating unexpected terror. (2) Russo-Japanese relations are currently friendly, so a non-aggression treaty is unnecessary. However, to enhance Russo-Japanese friendship, what harm is there in signing one since Russia is willing to do so? Many countries in Europe have signed non-aggression treaties. (3) We cannot abandon Russo-Japanese friendship simply because Russia and Japan have different systems of government. (4) It is true that Russia's Five-Year Plan emphasizes military industry. However, Russia's military preparations are not necessarily solely aimed at Japan. Looking at the relations between European countries and Russia makes this clear. (5) Comintern's communist propaganda did not begin today. We cannot oppose a non-aggression treaty because of communist propaganda. Although Japan has tried its best to suppress it, the activities of the Communist Party remain fierce. Originally, communist propaganda is a domestic political issue, and preventing communism requires implementing good governance and remedying the shortcomings of domestic political and economic structures. Attempting to stop it with an international treaty demonstrates insufficient understanding. (6) A Russo-Japanese-"Manchukuo" alliance is acceptable if it proceeds based on the above reasons. Using our country's strength to prevent external forces is what constitutes vital diplomacy. Japan does not need to be overly afraid of Soviet Russia. If Russia has military preparations, then we will respond with full military preparedness, without overreacting. Those who oppose signing a non-aggression treaty argue: (1) Neither Russia nor Japan intends to invade the other's territory, so why sign a non-aggression treaty? Russia's deep desire for this treaty may be because Russia harbors intentions of invading Japan. (2) The Kellogg-Briand Pact already exists, so why draw a snake and add feet? (3) The Russian and Japanese systems of government are fundamentally incompatible. (4) There is a fear that the non-aggression treaty will cause the public's thinking on national defense to slacken and neglect military preparations. (5) Russia's Five-Year Plan primarily focuses on military industry and sees Japan as an enemy, and we fear falling into its trap. (6) Russia does not respect trust and continues to promote communism in Japan. We fear that closer Russo-Japanese relations will promote the domestic communist movement. (7) A Russo-Japanese-"Manchukuo" alliance may invite communist forces to invade "Manchukuo," which is unfavorable to Japan's policy.</p>
<p>Tokyo dispatch from the Domei News Agency, 24th: Prime Minister Saito expressed his opinion yesterday in Hayama that a Russo-Japanese non-aggression treaty could be concluded. The Foreign Ministry's leadership, based on the fundamental reasons that (1) the Soviet Russian government is in a position of non-responsibility regarding the Comintern, and even if a non-aggression treaty is concluded, the Soviet Russian government does not guarantee ideological aggression, and (1) there is no need for a general non-aggression treaty in the current Russo-Japanese relations, but what is needed is a concrete and friendly relationship in economic relations, believes that it is still too early to conclude a non-aggression treaty. However, it does not oppose a temporary and partial non-aggression treaty on the Kwantung Army side. Regarding the Sakhalin or Korean borders, similar to the existing military agreements between Japan and Russia, concluding a temporary and partial non-aggression treaty between Japan, Russia, and "Manchukuo," including "Manchukuo," seems more appropriate. However, it has not yet been decided whether the Japanese side will propose this. Currently, both the Foreign Ministry and the military are studying this.</p>
<p>Tokyo dispatch from the China United News Agency, 24th: The Japanese Ambassador to Russia, *</p>
<p>Hirota, was ordered to enter the palace at 2:00 PM today to give an *</p>

<p>Left-Leaning University Students Arrested in Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo dispatch from the China United News Agency, 24th: Yesterday, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's Special Higher Police Division dispatched armed police to surround Rikkyo University in Tokyo and arrested six or seven members of the Anti-War League, suspected of being communists. The investigation is feared to expand, causing great panic.</p>

<p>Adding Mine Warfare Squadrons</p>
<p>Tokyo dispatch from the Domei News Agency, 24th: Today, the Navy received imperial approval to revise military ordinances regarding destroyer squadrons, submarine squadrons, minesweeper squadrons, and fleets. A new mine warfare squadron will be established after the existing destroyer squadron, submarine squadron, and minesweeper squadron. This is to supplement the shortcomings of the London Naval Treaty. Because the minelayers built in the supplementary plan are about to be completed, mine warfare squadrons will be formed with two ships per squadron, initially for testing and participation in various exercises.</p>
<p>Navy Minister Okada Resigns Due to Age</p>
<p>General Ambo May Succeed Him</p>
<p>Tokyo dispatch from the China United News Agency, 24th: Navy Minister Okada will reach the naval retirement age next spring. It is rumored that Minister Okada has decided to retire from active duty and resign from the position of Navy Minister. The Navy plans to recommend General Ambo as his successor.</p>
<p>Tokyo dispatch from the Domei News Agency, 24th: Navy Minister Okada will reach the retirement age of 65 at the end of January next year. At that time, the Navy Minister will either retire as stipulated or remain in active duty by some other means. The military and various other sectors are paying close attention to this. It seems that the Navy Minister has resolved to clear the way for younger generations, mentally resign from the position of Minister, and retire from active duty. When the Saito Cabinet was established, the Prime Minister's earnest requests forced him to serve as Navy Minister for the second time. He intended to cleanly retire after tidying up the aftermath of the May 15 Incident, purifying the morale within the department, and completing the replenishment of military strength caused by the London Naval Treaty. Since then, the May 15 Incident has been handled step by step according to the Navy Minister's policy, and there is no longer any disturbance within the Navy Department. The purification within the department can be completed with the regular personnel changes in December to refresh the ranks and prepare for the future. Regarding the replenishment of military strength following the London Naval Treaty, it will be included in the second replenishment plan in the next fiscal year's budget and supplementary budget to supplement the shortcomings and renew the Navy. This is the Navy Minister's desired goal, which can be fully realized, so he plans to take the opportunity to retire bravely. However, Prime Minister Saito and the Navy's top leaders are concerned that Okada's brave retirement at this time will have a major impact.</p>
<p>Philippine Independence Issue</p>
<p>To Be Presented to the US Congress This Session for Discussion</p>
<p>Some Advocate Establishing a Neutral Country</p>
<p>To Ease Tensions Between the US and Japan</p>
<p>Washington dispatch from the National News Agency, 23rd: Today, it is widely rumored here that if the United States allows the Philippines complete independence and its sovereignty is guaranteed by a neutrality treaty, then many important figures in Japan will also support the same neutrality for Manchuria. It is said that foreign diplomats here have already secretly discussed the possibility of this neutrality movement, but no one is willing to publicly propose this plan. However, the diplomats participating in the discussion generally believe that if treaties of neutrality are concluded for both regions, it would open a way to resolve the urgent problems in the Far East. It is also heard that some leading figures in Japan especially favor concluding a treaty for the permanent neutrality of Manchuria, hoping to refute other countries' accusations that Japan wants to expand its territory. According to reports, the Philippine independence issue was initially just a matter of partisan disputes in the United States. The Republican Party opposed independence, while the Democratic Party favored independence under considerable guarantees. Since the economic depression, sugar-producing states and dairy farmers in the United States have been greatly afraid of competition from Philippine sugar and coconut oil, so even Republicans have supported independence. The House of Representatives in the last session had already passed a bill for independence after eight years. After the current Congress convenes, the Senate will also begin deliberations on this matter.</p>
<p>US Representative Meets British Prime Minister</p>
<p>Exchanging Views on Disarmament</p>
<p>Havas, 24th: London: Davis, the US representative attending the Disarmament Conference, was received by British Prime Minister MacDonald this morning to discuss everything and talk about the possibility of immediate implementation. The press has commented extensively on Davis's stay in London and his meetings with British politicians. Some have said that Foreign Secretary Simon visited Prime Minister MacDonald's villa in Gatwick yesterday for secret negotiations with Davis. This is not true. Although Davis's visit to MacDonald involved an exchange of views on disarmament issues, it was merely a friendly visit.</p>
<p>Herriot Delivers a Somber Speech on a Former Battlefield</p>
<p>A Heartfelt Plea for Peace</p>
<p>Havas, 23rd: Lains: Lains is located in the plain of northern France, with the rolling hills of Lorette in between, which was the site of fierce battles between the two armies during the European War. Approximately one hundred thousand soldiers from the German and French armies are buried here. Prime Minister Herriot's speech yesterday was given at this old battlefield filled with grave mounds. Although the Prime Minister's speech was not political in nature, it inevitably concluded with an appeal to all nations to abandon past grievances and reconcile with each other. His speech, given in a place that had endured the suffering of war, made his appeal especially meaningful. Herriot then said that northern France, which had been devastated by war, with 2.5 million acres of land, had surprisingly been restored to its original state in ten years. The efforts of the French people are truly amazing. Herriot also said, "After the war, everything was desolate. However, workers and farmers worked tirelessly to bring life back to the vast land. Such immortal achievements are truly amazing. However, such efforts are beyond ordinary limits. If the people continue to do so, the nation will lose its life. What we see before us shows that the nations of the world should reconcile with each other." Herriot also said that peace cannot be achieved with empty words. He said, "The person speaking to you is a believer in upholding peace. He has come here to give his advice to all those who are sincere. Let us try to discard prejudices, broaden our horizons, and think calmly. Then we will know that the vast majority of the 75,000 German soldiers who lie buried here also wanted to enjoy the happiness of peace and work. What France hopes for is that all nations will abandon their grievances and join hands together. I said this in 1924. I hope that the people of all countries can take France as a model. The work of 1924 was continued by us in Geneva and Lausanne. Regarding material interests, France does not want to argue with others, so it only practices philanthropy. Therefore, France is planning to establish a plan to link disarmament and security with each other, and use the power of legal development to seek the abolition of armaments. The French government is tirelessly working on this cause. To be successful, all nations must be as rational as France."</p>
<p>The War in the Chaco is Intense</p>
<p>Part of the Bolivian Army is Annihilated</p>
<p>The Fort of Ars Falls</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, 23rd: Capital of Argentina: The Paraguayan capital has released news that Paraguayan troops annihilated a portion of the Bolivian army (four regiments) in the forests near Ars. The remnants of the Bolivian army had to retreat to the fortress of Ars. The Paraguayan army has surrounded the fortress, capturing many people and seizing countless weapons.</p>
<p>Havas, 24th: Capital of Argentina: The battles in the Chaco are continuing. News from the capitals of both Bolivia and Paraguay is conflicting. Bolivia claimed yesterday that its troops had defeated the Paraguayan army after hand-to-hand combat. Paraguay said that it had captured the fort of Ars. This news was later confirmed by Bolivia, stating that it had abandoned the fort.</p>
<p>British Newspaper Commentary</p>
<p>On the Status of Chinese Government Bonds</p>
<p>Reuters, 24th: London: The Times criticized the status of Chinese government bonds today, saying that the number of drawn bonds that have not been redeemed has increased year by year. In February of this year, the Stock Exchange Council allowed the trading of these bonds, considering them special transactions, and the Chinese government paid interest on both drawn and undrawn bonds when issuing back interest. From then on, the Chinese government will likely continue to do so. According to this situation, the market's claim that there is not much difference between drawn and undrawn Chinese bonds is not without reason. If drawn bonds are still not redeemed, then a strange situation will soon occur, that is, the number of drawn bonds will exceed the number of undrawn bonds.</p>
<p>British Official Note Announcing Termination of Commercial Agreement with Russia</p>
<p>Published</p>
<p>Havas, 23rd: London: The British Foreign Office notified the Soviet representative in London on October 17 that the temporary commercial agreement signed between the UK and the Soviet Union in London on April 16, 1930, is now terminated according to the provisions of Article 7, Section 1 of the agreement, effective April 17, 1933. This notice was formally published by the Foreign Office this afternoon. Foreign Secretary Simon also stated in the notice, "I take this opportunity to declare to your representative that my government is still willing to continue the commercial relations between the two countries." It is also heard that the British government plans to quickly proceed with consultations on the situation resulting from the termination of the agreement.</p>
<p>The Mystery of the French Prime Minister's Visit to Spain</p>
<p>National News Agency, 23rd: Paris: Although official sources have made great efforts to deny the widely circulated rumor of a Franco-Spanish defense alliance regarding French Prime Minister Herriot's planned visit to Madrid, it does not seem to match the facts. According to reliable sources, even if Herriot's visit to Spain does not result in a Franco-Spanish defense alliance, there must be some other plan. This so-called other plan is a treaty established between France and Spain that, in the future, when France is at war, foreign colonial troops can be transported to the European continent and then transported north via Spanish railways to avoid the dangers of sea transport. Furthermore, Herriot intends to have Spain guarantee the strict neutrality of the Strait of Gibraltar to prevent the fortresses there from being seized by the Italian navy if France and Italy go to war in the future. France attaches great value to these conditions and is prepared to grant Spain important concessions in North Africa and provide it with substantial loans in economic terms.</p>
<p>British Newspapers Pay Close Attention to Matsuoka's Trip to Geneva</p>
<p>Reuters, 24th: London: London newspapers today paid close attention to the departure of Japanese chief representative Matsuoka for Geneva. The government especially noted the remarks he made on the eve of his departure. His claim that he opposes the Lytton Report's recommendation that the sovereignty of the three northeastern provinces be returned to China has not been given much attention. The Daily News said that the longer the Lytton Report is studied, the more its proposals are seen as suitable for political maneuvering. Last year, the report almost granted Japan everything it asked for. Does Japan want an honorable solution, or does it want to be an enemy of the whole world? Japan is between these two. Even the militarists should allow Matsuoka to seek an honorable peace and end the entanglement that has not stopped.</p>
<p>Japan Participates in the Chicago Exposition</p>
<p>The Budget is Projected at 230,000 Yen</p>
<p>Japan United Press, 24th: Tokyo: The Ministry of Finance announced that the international exposition will be held in Chicago in June of next year. Japan has decided to participate in this exposition with a budget of 230,068 yen, which will be paid from the second reserve fund of the seventh year of Showa.</p>
<p>The Invention of the Underwater Tank</p>
<p>Havas, 23rd: Madrid: Spanish worker Ruiz invented an underwater tank and used electricity to separate pure water, separating light oxygen and hydrogen. He used oxygen for the people in the car to breathe. Today, Ruiz tested the car in the Cabo Lago in Cadiz. No fewer than 15,000 people watched around the lake. The car first circled the lake and then entered the water. Ruiz, sitting in the car, sent a message from the bottom of the lake praising the republic and the current government and expressing his respect to those who had caused misfortune at sea and were buried in the belly of the fish. The car lasted 95 minutes underwater. Later, the lake water gradually seeped into the car, and the car had to be lifted out of the water. It is said that Ruiz will continue to experiment.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>From Hailar: To the Shen Bao and the Anti-Japanese Support Association: It has been a year since the Northeast fell into enemy hands. However, our last piece of pure land on the Manchurian border has been supported with painstaking efforts, all thanks to our Garrison Commander Su Bingwen. Now, representatives from various regions and commanders of various volunteer armies have gathered in Hailar to plot national salvation. They have unanimously elected Commander Su as the commander-in-chief of the Northeast People's National Salvation Army. He took office on the first of this month and simultaneously telegraphed to announce to the people of the country that he would soon send troops to divide and advance, engage in fierce battles day after day, and repeatedly thwart the enemy's attacks. Recapturing Longjiang is within reach. The news has spread, and the people of the world are united. The people of the Northeast, especially, are deeply indignant. Even women and children in remote rural areas have saved food and clothing to support our soldiers. However, the Manchurian border is desolate, with a red land stretching for thousands of miles. After the war, the number of residents has decreased, and the usual military pay relies on relief. Now that we are facing a crisis of external resistance, we are even more afraid of running out of food and failing to accomplish our mission. The success or failure of our mission hangs in the balance. The need for assistance is urgent, like a spark igniting our hearts. We have long admired your newspaper's and association's compassion for the hungry and the drowning. You have long been known for your clear reputation of saving the people and the country. With great sincerity, we send this telegram to implore you to provide rice and other aid. We rely on your advocacy. If you can give a high call, it will surely resonate across the mountains. Providing a continuous supply and mobilizing the people will ensure that the righteous army has no worries about food and can successfully save the country. Our eagerness to hear from you is pressing. We are sending the funds directly to the American firm, Shin Shen Company, in Hailar. Please send a receipt to show good faith. We have also heard that the Ji Lu County People's National Salvation Support Association in Heilongjiang Province is knocking at your door.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<p>Tianjin Tram Workers' Strike</p>
<p>Party and Government Agencies are Mediating</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: The Tianjin Tram and Electric Light Company was founded in 1904 (the 30th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty) by the Belgian firm, Seichang &amp; Co., when Yuan Shikai was the Minister of Beiyang. It has been 28 years since then. Now, due to the rapid expansion of business, the annual profit is around 3 million. In recent years, labor disputes have arisen from time to time due to the poor treatment of workers. This spring, when tram fares were raised, the entire city opposed it, and there were already signs of a tram workers' strike. Later, because the workers accepted advice from all sides that workers must jointly maintain local order during a period of serious national crisis, the tram workers' union postponed the strike. On the 14th of this month, the workers, citing the fact that the company had not only failed to sign the eight demands it had promised in March of last year, but also had not fully implemented them, convened a temporary workers' representative conference and resolved to submit seven more demands to the company. The demands are: 1. All company employees should be issued two seasons of official clothing each year. 2. Those who die while in the service of the company due to illness should be given a funeral allowance of 200 yuan per person (those who die on duty are not included). 3. Employees who are in the service of the company should be provided with official housing by the company. If there is no official housing, each person should be given a housing allowance of 3 yuan. 4. Employees who are in the service of the company should be provided with free electricity up to 20 kWh per month. Those who exceed 20 kWh should be charged at a rate of 12 cents per kWh. 5. The Inspection Department should continue to provide a bonus of 3 yuan per month to those who work hard on public affairs. 6. Reading boards should be set up at appropriate locations in the Machinery Department, the Power Plant, and the Electric Light Department. 7. The monthly subsidy for the workers' children's school should be increased by 100 yuan. After the resolutions were made, the union reported the conditions to the Party and government authorities and requested them to mediate in order to achieve a peaceful solution. The Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to contact the company, but the company refused to accept them, saying that the newly appointed general manager was about to arrive in China from Belgium and the old general manager was not responsible for handling the union's affairs. Upon hearing this, the union convened a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on the evening of the 20th. The masses were outraged and decided to go on strike uniformly starting on the morning of yesterday (the 21st) to urge the company to come to its senses. For the past two days, all tram passengers have not had to purchase tickets. As a result, men, women, old and young, who usually walked instead of taking the tram, have all been taking the tram, resulting in an unusual number of passengers. The speed of the tram has also been slowed down due to passengers rushing on and off. The order of the city has been slightly affected, but fortunately, no accidents have occurred, and public security has not been affected. Except for the workers in the power plant, who are still working, and all the workers repairing the street lights, the electric light department has gone on strike. The street lights are not turned off even during the day in order to consume electricity. The company's attitude has become even tougher as the workers have gone on strike. The Belgian consul has also contacted our authorities yesterday. The Belgian manager, Wang Kesen, went to the provincial government this morning to see Chairman Yu and asked him to stop the strike. The outcome is still unknown. However, Chairman Yu told reporters that he had not heard of the strike before it occurred. Although the company recognizes the provincial government as the negotiating counterpart, it had not reported to the government beforehand. He has now handed the matter over to the municipal government for prompt handling. The municipal government has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to mediate properly. The Civil Affairs Section Director Yang Litan of the Municipal Party Committee has also gone with government personnel to handle the matter. However, at present, the attitudes of both parties are tough, making mediation difficult. The company's losses are close to 10,000 yuan per day. If the delay continues, the losses will be even greater. (October 22)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Central Party Headquarters Memorial Week <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Ding Chao-wu Reports on Saving the Nation and Eradicating Humiliation</p>
<p>The Central Committee held its weekly memorial service for the late Premier at 9 a.m. on the 24th. Those in attendance included Central Committee members Chen Guofu, Chu Minyi, Ding Chao-wu, Chen Lifu, Zeng Kuoqing, Li Ciwen, Xie Zuomin, Chen Zhaoying, Xiao Zhongzhen, Huang Jichen, Zheng Zhannan, Hong Ludong, Miao Peicheng, and over six hundred staff members. Chairman Chen Guofu presided, and Ding Chao-wu delivered a report titled "Saving the Nation and Eradicating Humiliation," which roughly stated: Faced with the pressing threat from foreign powers, everyone should prepare "how to save the nation and eradicate humiliation," learn from Goujian's decade of recuperation and education, and strive to strengthen our power. The Chinese people often suffer rudeness and contempt from foreigners, experiencing no small amount of insult and stimulation, yet they remain immersed in a life of pleasure and do not consider it shameful. Therefore, the first step is to awaken the public to "know shame." Next, focus on recuperation and education to cultivate a weak nation. Furthermore, gather human and material resources, unite and consolidate. The Party should unite the people with sincerity, using the Premier's methods, and employ self-governance to seek unity, so that the power to resist foreign aggression will naturally arise. The "Method of Implementing Currency Revolution," "Methods for Promoting Cooperatives," and "Methods for Regulating Food Supply," recently proposed by Mr. Chen Guofu, are indeed excellent plans for saving the nation if implemented. Finally, it is necessary to train the people to develop good habits of observing order and knowing etiquette, promote the spirit of martial valor, and eliminate weak and useless phenomena, then the future will naturally have hope. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e7">The Land Tax Assessment Crisis in Jiangdu Becomes More Serious <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Villagers Gather, Clashing with Military Police</p>
<p>Military Police Open Fire, Killing Seven Villagers and Wounding Over Ten</p>
<p>Traffic Disrupted, City Gates Closed, Shops Also Shut Down</p>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: The second wave of land tax assessment turmoil in the Second District of Jiangdu is expanding. After the county government was destroyed last night (the 22nd), military police arrested 250 villagers, both men and women, in separate operations. County Magistrate Yang held court overnight, interrogating them until dawn. According to Magistrate Yang, although the villagers are not suspected of being incited by communists, there are local bullies instigating them from within. However, the villagers continued to sound gongs throughout the night, and the turmoil spread further. This morning (the 23rd), over ten thousand men and women gathered at the Fuyun Gate, Xu Ning Gate, and the opposite bank of the river, each holding farm implements and other items, preventing the passage of boats. By noon, even cars could not pass. Many shops in the city remained closed. Military, political, and police agencies received information in advance and dispatched teams to the city to prevent and closely monitor the situation. The scene of officials and civilians confronting each other across the river was more serious than yesterday. The villagers in the Fuyun Gate area were particularly numerous, occupying civilian boats and ferries, surging across the river to confront the military police, resulting in a conflict. As a result, the military police opened fire, killing Xu Xueqing (resident of San Cha He), Mao Anlong, Xie Chunrong (resident of Kong Jia Zhuang), Yin Yu Shi (resident of Shi Jia Qiao Yang Jia Zhuang), Yin Xu Shi (resident of Jiang Yin Jia Zhuang), Huang Gui Shi (resident of Zhuan Qiao), Lu Yuzhen (resident of Xin He Wan), and seven other men and women on the spot. Zhu Da Liang's wife, Zhu Xiao Guniang (Guan Yin Xiang), Xie Yong'an (resident of Shui Long Qiao), Jiang Da (resident of Han Jia Zhuang), a Kong (resident of Dai Jia Zhuang), Yang Dai Shi (resident of Yang Jia Zhuang), Zhu Li Shi (resident of Yan Jia Xiang), Zhou Hongtao (resident of Xue Jia Lou), Jin Yin Shi, Huang Shi (resident of Yang Jia Qiao), and over ten other men and women were wounded. Seeing that many were killed and injured, the villagers retreated in fear. The military police immediately entered the city and closed the city gates. At the same time, villagers strongly desired to enter the city through other gates, so those gates were also closed. By about 10 a.m., traffic in and out of the city was completely cut off, and cars and boats stopped running. After the city gates were closed, the military police were armed and on alert on the city walls. The villagers could not enter the city and only cried outside the city. Later, the Second Battalion of the Independent Regiment and the Provincial Security Team successively came out of the city to suppress the situation, and order was slightly restored. The wounded villagers were carried to the home of Wang Jingting, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, to be treated (Wang's house is located at the earth dam outside the South Gate). Wang's residence then contacted various chambers of commerce by phone to request doctors to go out of the city for treatment. The county party headquarters, considering that this turmoil was expanding, invited Central Committee member Wang Boling, as well as heads of military, political, and police agencies, and leaders of various legal entities to a meeting this morning to discuss solutions. Wang Boling immediately stated that while the suffering of the people should be considered, the authority of the government should also be maintained. The government might accept the legitimate demands of the people. He immediately nominated Standing Committee Member Yu of the County Party Headquarters, Executive Committee Member Lin, Chairman Wang of the Chamber of Commerce, and Director Shi of the Farmers' Association, a total of four people, to be led by Commander Li out of the city to solicit the opinions of the villagers. The representatives departed at about 12 o'clock, first going to the East Gate to climb the city wall and announce that the villagers should retreat to the side of the Dutian Temple in the east of the river to wait for the discussion. The villagers agreed. The representatives left the city, crossed the river to that location, and Wang Jingting announced that everything should be proposed by the villagers in two points: first, all those arrested should be released; second, there should be no further investigation of farmland. The representatives also went to the bus station and announced that the villagers also demanded the same as before. The representatives answered regarding the first point that as long as the villagers no longer took actions outside of the law, the administrative side could release those arrested. Regarding the second point, it was necessary to follow proper procedures and jointly negotiate a solution with representatives publicly elected by the villagers. The villagers indicated their acceptance and then nominated more than ten representatives. Wang Jingting and others entered the city with them and went to the County Party Headquarters to request that Central Committee member Wang, County Magistrate Yang, and Commander Li come to the headquarters for consultation. It is reported that County Magistrate Yang has agreed that the arrested villagers can be released separately tomorrow after providing guarantees. It is reported that the county government has already telegraphed the circumstances of the incident to the provincial government yesterday and has received a reply from the provincial government today. The general idea is that the villagers' riot is indeed reprehensible, but the county magistrate's handling was also improper and that he should quickly consider and arrange for a settlement of the aftermath and not allow the turmoil to expand. Chairman Gu also telegraphed Commander Li to assist in maintaining order. The Finance Department also sent Wang Luzhi and the Provincial Security Office sent Yin Xingru to Yangzhou yesterday to secretly investigate the truth of the turmoil. Because land and water traffic between Zhenjiang and Yangzhou was cut off this afternoon, the provincial government telegraphed Bureau Chief Chen of the Public Security Bureau to inquire about the situation. The injured villagers have been sent to hospitals in the city and Zhenjiang for treatment. The bodies of those killed are still lying outside the Fuyun Gate, and their families are holding their bodies and crying in grief. Tonight, the city is under special martial law, and traffic is cut off at 8 p.m., prohibiting pedestrians from passing. It is reported that at about 11 o'clock, the villagers retreated to the area outside the East Gate and continued to sound gongs, and many boats were seized. (Night of the 23rd)</p>

Military and political dignitaries from Beiping and Tianjin, prominent figures from the opposition, people from all walks of life, Mongolian princes, commoners, and Lamaist monks attended, reaching 100,000 participants, truly a unprecedented grand event in Beiping. The situation during the ceremony is recorded below:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Venue: Elaborate colorful archways were erected at the Meridian Gate and the East and West Flowery Gates. Participants entered with tickets. National flags and various dharma flags were hung at the Gate of Supreme Harmony. Inside the gate, the ground of the Danbi courtyard was covered with palm mats and reed mats. Those without altar passes were restricted to this area, sitting on the mats. Attendees with altar passes gathered on the dais in the hall, approximately 2,000 people. The platform was covered with red carpet, and the audience sat on the ground. The left side was for lamas and Mongolians, and the right side was for people from all walks of life, mostly women and the elderly. Many wore Western suits and leather shoes.</p>
<p>In the center of the hall in front of the platform, a Dharma altar was set up, about ten feet high. The altar was covered with red silk, and the dharma table was wrapped in yellow satin. Dharma instruments were placed on the table, and a wooden ladder was placed next to the altar. The left side of the altar was for the seats of Mongolian princes and military and political leaders, and the right side was for foreign guests. Many Mongolian princes and military and political dignitaries were not seated, but rested inside the hall. The foreign guest area was full.</p>
<p>In front of the guest seats in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, a special Buddha seat was set up for the Panchen Lama. The center of the hall was surrounded by yellow ropes to create a restricted area. On the left were offerings of fruits, rice, and sugar arranged on tables. On the right was the mandala, an octagonal shape made of yellow silk. Brocade banners were hung on the city. The pavilion in the center of the city was also colored in red and yellow. Eight Buddha tables were placed on the eight sides of the city, each with copper plates, oil lamps, and pots and bottles of dharma instruments.</p>
<p>Initiation Ceremony: The chanting of scriptures began at 6:30 AM and ended at 12:00 PM. The initiation ceremony was held from 2:00 PM. At 2:00 PM, the audience took their seats. At 2:15 PM, the lamas began to play music. At 2:20 PM, the Panchen Lama came out of the hall and ascended to the seat. The Panchen Lama wore a yellow dharma robe, a red shawl on his left shoulder, his right arm bare, holding a copper bell, and sat in meditation with crossed legs. At this time, the audience below the stage prostrated and paid homage. After a while, the Panchen Lama held pink scriptures and began to lecture. His speech was very fast and he coughed frequently. After finishing one volume, the Khenpo translated it into Chinese. The lecture lasted about an hour, and the audience presented hadas to the Panchen Lama. For a moment, yellow and blue silk scarves piled up several feet high. The Panchen Lama also sent his disciples to distribute saffron holy water and five-colored rice flowers to the audience.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the initiation ceremony continued. First, his disciples used copper cups to anoint the foreheads and chins of the audience with holy oil. The Panchen Lama also personally performed the initiation for military and political dignitaries. The first to receive the initiation were Zhang Xueliang, followed by Duan Qirui, Zhu Qinglan, Wu Guangxin, Cao Rulin, and Wang Yitang. After the initiation, Tibetan grass and red ropes were distributed. The audience on the altar scrambled to seize them from the lamas, but the audience below the stage received nothing.</p>
<p>After a while, Mongolians brought grass down from the altar and scattered it, causing the audience to crowd and struggle for it. After a long time, they managed to escape. After the red ropes and Tibetan grass were distributed, the Panchen Lama continued to lecture until 5:00 PM when he stepped down. The first day of the assembly ended. (October 21st)</p>

The Education Department Believes That Examination and Certification is the Best Way to Alleviate the Current Shortage of Teachers, Carefully Select Talent, and Promote Education. Upon Investigation, Many Primary School Teachers in Various Counties Are Unqualified and Fill Positions Improperly. Those Teachers Who Should Be Tested Often Avoid the Examination on Various Pretexts, Which Goes Against the Principle of Carefully Selecting Teachers. It Is Now Scheduled That the Fourth Examination and Certification of Primary School Teachers Will Be Held from April 3rd to 5th of Next Year. Registration Will Begin Immediately and End on January 31st of Next Year. The Original Registration Fee Was One Yuan, but in Consideration of Financial Difficulties, It Has Been Reduced to Fifty Cents.

The Corpse's Family and the Original Informants Were Taken Back to Kunshan by the Bailiffs and Were Scheduled to Return to Changshu Today to Report Back.</p>

<p>Declaration of Establishment: Those Who Lavishly Discuss Education Today Mostly Advocate Empty Talk and Do Not Engage in Practical Work. Since the Founding of the Republic of China, Twenty-One Years Have Passed. Among Them, More Than Ten Years Have Been Spent on the Push and Remnants of Warlords. National Education Is on the Verge of Bankruptcy. The Educational Policies That Adapt to the Trends of the Times and Social Needs Have Not Been Determined. At the Same Time, Due to the Instability in the Country, National Education Cannot Achieve Uniformity and Prosperity. After the National Government Established Its Capital in Nanjing and Unified the Country, It Promulgated the Three Principles of the People as the Purpose of National Education. The Whole Country Has Something to Follow. If We Can Actively Implement It, We May Not Be Able to Achieve Considerable Results. Because of the Frequent Civil Wars and the Depleted Economy, Coupled With the Frequent Educational Trends, the Education of One Line of Life Is Not as Good as Extinguished. It Is Really Gratifying That Shanghai Is the First City in Asia. Business Is Prosperous, Industry Is Developed, and the Population Is More Than Three Million. The Tide of the East and West Cultures Take This as the Center of Contact and Stimulation. The Concentration of Talents and the Establishment of Schools in the Field of Education Cannot Be Compared With Any Other City in the Country. According to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's Investigation in the Second Semester of the Nineteenth Year, There Are 744 Elementary Schools, 125 Secondary Schools, and 33 Higher Schools. The Statistics Show That There Are 932 Schools, With Assets Reaching More Than 32 Million Yuan and Annual Revenue Reaching More Than 11 Million Yuan. Other Social Education and Cultural Institutions Are Not Included. Therefore, We Can See That the Educational Power in Shanghai Alone Is Strong. Shanghai Should Take the Lead in the Country in Promoting Academics and Transforming Customs. If We Compare and Study the Number of Public and Private Schools at All Levels in Shanghai, We Can Get a Good Impression. Why Has National Education Fallen Into Bankruptcy in the Past Ten Years? Because Educational Funding Has Not Been Guaranteed, the Expenses of Independent Military Needs Are Huge, and They Often Involve Educational Expenses. Strikes and Teachings Occur From Time to Time, Which Deeply Affects the Future of Education. This Is Not the Case in Shanghai. Except for Patriotic Movements or Other Movements, There Are Fewer Cases of Strikes and Teachings Caused Purely by Economic Relations. The Proportion of the Number of Private Schools to Public Schools in the City Is As Follows: Private Schools Account for 74% of Elementary Schools, While Public Schools Account for Only 26%. Private Schools Account for 90% of Secondary Schools, While Public Schools Account for Only 10%. Private Schools Account for 73% of Higher Schools, While Public Schools Account for Only 27%. Private Funding Is Generally the Responsibility of Private Groups and Is Not Affected by Political Trends. Among Those Who Run Education, There Must Be No Lack of Those Who Focus on Education As a Lifelong Career. Therefore, Although National Education Is in a State of Destruction and Fragmentation, the Education of Shanghai Alone Can Still Develop Year by Year and Maintain a Lifeline for National Education. Although Shanghai Has the Above-Mentioned Advantages, We Still Cannot Be Satisfied. In Terms of Higher Education, Most of Them Create Empty and Useless Talents That Cannot Meet the Needs of Modern China. In Terms of Primary and Secondary Education, The Administration Is Not Necessary for Improving. Since the January 28th Incident, the Unprecedented Calamities Suffered by Our Educational Circles in Shanghai Have Made Us Feel Deep Sadness. For Example, the Oriental Library, Which Treasures More Than 372,000 Volumes of Chinese and Foreign Books, Is the Most Complete Private Library in the Country. It Was Burned to Ashes by the Japanese Army. The Number of Schools Destroyed by the Ruthless Artillery Fire in the War Zone Is Countless. The Statistics Show That the Loss Is No Less Than Tens of Millions. The Only Remaining Cultural Institutions Have Been Brutally Trampled by the Japanese. From Now On, How Should We Work Hard to Revitalize Shanghai Education? How Should We Learn From the Past and Improve Shanghai Education? Creating Life for Shanghai Education Is to Save Fate for National Education. We Are All Part of the Educational Community. We Are All Responsible.</p>
<p>The Preparations for This Association Have Been Going on for a Year. Now, It Has Been Established. It Is an Honor to Be Entrusted by the Educational Circles in Shanghai. In Addition to Concentrating on Research to Promote Academics, It Has the Obligation to Assist and Promote the Government. Through Careful Research and Common Discussion, We Know That University Education Is In Vain and Impractical. Therefore, Higher Education Economics Needs to Be Concentrated, and Course Standards Need to Be Improved. As for Primary and Secondary Education, Many of Its Facilities Are Highly Corresponding to the Actual Life of the People. Elementary and Junior High Schools Lack Suitable Production Training, and Senior High Schools Are Mostly General Subjects. As a Result, Most Junior and High School Graduates Who Cannot Afford to Attend School Are Difficult to Find a Way Out. Therefore, Vocational Training in Primary and Secondary Schools Needs to Be Rescued. When the Current Political Training Period Also Encountered National Disasters, If We Want to Train the People, We Should Pay Attention to Popularizing People's Wisdom and Awakening the People's Consciousness. More Than Half of the School-Age Children in Shanghai Have Not Yet Enrolled in School. Therefore, the Popularization of Compulsory Education Is Imminent. Many Enthusiastic People in Shanghai Often Donate Money to Establish Schools. Private Schools Need to Be Encouraged by the Education Authorities. There Are Not Many Public Primary and Secondary Schools. Most of the Rest Are Private. Therefore, the Tuition Fees Charged Are Naturally Relatively High, Which Makes It Difficult for Poor Children to Afford School. How Should We Find a Way to Relief Them? At the Very Least, We Must Ensure That the Opportunity to Receive Compulsory Education Is Equal. Shanghai's Industry and Commerce Are Developed, and Factories Are Abundant. The Number of Laboring Classes Who Work Hard Reaches More Than 800,000. Most of These People Come From Rural Areas and Rarely Receive Education. Therefore, the Supplementary Education for Workers Should Be Carefully Planned and Provided for in a Comprehensive Manner. We Must Ensure That All Workers in the City Have the Opportunity to Study. There Are Only More Than Ten Libraries in Such a Large City With a Population of More Than Three Million That Are Related to Social Education. Among Them, In Addition to the Oriental Being Destroyed, Most of the Rest Are Only Simple Equipment. In Addition, Public Schools, Public Education Centers, and Public Sports Fields Are Rare. Museums Are Still Vacant. In the Future, If We Want to Improve the People's Knowledge, All Social Education Institutions Need to Be Expanded. Since the Shanghai War, Colleagues Have Deeply Felt the Lack of Practical Science in Our Country. Therefore, All Research and Inventions of Practical Science Need to Be Encouraged by the Education Authorities. Shanghai Is a Mixed City of Chinese and Foreigners and Is the Most Unharmonious Area in Our Country Today. Although Zhabei Tan Town and Pudong Near the Countryside Have Been Affected by the Erosion of Large Cities, People's Lives Still Retain the Relics of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries. The Nanjing Road Area Is All Modern in Scale. In This Complex and Unharmonious Environment, It Is Inevitable That People Will Wander and Have Nowhere to Go. Therefore, It Is Impossible to Delay Guiding the People's Knowledge in Life. All These Problems Are Closely Related to National Independence, Universal Civil Rights, and the Development of People's Livelihood. Colleagues Are Eager to Work Together With All People in Shanghai. We Also Hope That Famous People in Shanghai Will Provide Support and Guidance to Promote Education in Shanghai. Fortunately, National Education Is Fortunately. This Is a Declaration.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Fourth Elementary School Teacher Examination <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>County Education Bureau Orders All School Teachers to Comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to all elementary school principals, stating: "Regarding the JiangSu Province Education Department's Order No. 5, it is stated that the experimental examination and verification of elementary school teachers is a crucial policy for alleviating the current shortage of teachers and also a method for carefully selecting talent and improving education. The Department has held several sessions and explained everything thoroughly, which should be understood by all. However, it has been found that many elementary school teachers in various counties still fill positions with unqualified teachers, and many personnel who should take the experimental examination and verification are avoiding the examination under various pretexts, which is contrary to the Department's intention of carefully selecting teachers. It is now decided that the fourth elementary school teacher experimental examination and verification will be held from April 3rd to 5th of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1933]. The registration deadline is set from the date of receiving this Department's order until January 31st of the 22nd year. The registration fee is originally one yuan, but this session will be reduced to fifty cents to show consideration for the financial difficulties of elementary school teachers. All sub-district procedures and registration review procedures will be handled in accordance with the previous verification regulations. Once the registration and examination dates for this session are set, they will not be postponed. All Bureau Chiefs should follow the prescribed deadlines to notify all unqualified elementary school teachers to register and take the examination without allowing them to avoid it. After this session of verification, all unqualified elementary school teachers will not be allowed to be employed unless they have passed the verification examination. The Department is determined to rectify the teaching profession and will not show any leniency. Elementary school teachers who should take the experimental examination and verification should not hesitate and mislead themselves. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued to instruct the Bureau Chief to comply and publicize it widely. This is of utmost importance." Upon receiving this order, in addition to separate orders, this order is issued to instruct the school principal to inform all teachers who should take the experimental examination and verification to register before the deadline and not to delay and mislead themselves. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>The faculty and students of Shanghai University have always been enthusiastic about rural education and have worked hard to promote rural work in recent years. They have established rural service centers near the university, such as free elementary schools, public baths, and clinics, which have achieved considerable results. Students have also organized self-improvement groups that often go to the countryside during their spare time to get close to rural farmers, using methods such as talks and lectures to promote national awareness, instill general knowledge, and guide reading and learning, striving for all grassroots national salvation work, so that the countryside and schools can be assimilated to popularize education and improve the knowledge level of the masses.

<p>Charles T. Black's Nicholas University basketball team was famous in last year's Six Giants League. Black has a tactic of using left-handed hook passes and clever feints and sudden movements. In this tactic, No. 1 receives the pass from No. 4 in the penalty area. No. 2 leads the defender to the arc of the penalty area to block No. 5's defense. No. 5 can take this opportunity to rush to the basket. He (No. 5) receives the left-handed hook pass from No. 1 at that spot and gently lifts it into the basket from the basket.</p>

Mr. Zhang is an old friend of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. He and Dr. Sun organized the Tongmenghui to create the Republic of China. General Weng's Songhu battle achievements were for the nation to fight for survival and for the country to fight for glory. He also mentioned the fact that President Du loves the motherland. It has long been admired by the people of the country and does not need to be described in detail. However, the national crisis is pressing, and there are still many places where the three gentlemen are needed. I have specially prepared a simple banquet to wish the three gentlemen to cherish themselves for the sake of the country, and at the same time wish all of you present to work together for the country. Jigong is not talented and should try his best to follow the leaders to serve the country. Next, Mr. Zhang Yongfu, General Weng Zhaoyuan, and President Du Huisheng gave speeches.

<p>According to the Shanghai Office of the Volunteer Army stationed in Shanghai, the China United News Agency reported on the 24th that the Northeast Volunteer Army China-Korea Joint Army issued a telegram. The contents are excerpted as follows: All newspaper offices, legal groups, elders, and overseas Chinese are informed that since the September 18th Incident, it has been more than a year. The violent Japanese have taken an inch and taken a foot, taking Longsha in the north and seizing Jinzhou in the west. Their actions are fierce and shocking to the world. They have even invaded Shanghai and harassed Tianjin. Although the country has fortunate to have loyal and brave troops who fight to the death against the enemy, they have not succeeded. However, the wolf's ambition and fierce flames have not diminished. Recently, they have been pouring their full strength into secretly peeping at Jehol and going their own way, ignoring public reason and justice. It is intolerable to see the foreign troubles becoming more urgent and national affairs becoming more difficult. I cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the beautiful rivers and mountains perish in the hands of foreign races, and the descendants of Xuanyuan become horses and cattle. I have raised the flag of righteousness and vowed to drive out the ugly creatures. The stone will rot and the sea will dry up, and this ambition will not change. Since the uprising, it has been a year in an instant. After thousands of miles of fighting, the soldiers have no heart to retreat, and they are eager to be the first in battle. Although they have not painfully drunk the Yellow Dragon, they have already frightened the enemy. However, the lack of firearms and supplies has a significant impact on the war. In particular, medical supplies are in urgent need of supply. Lightly wounded soldiers often die because medical supplies are incomplete. To die for the country is a deserved death. However, such sacrifices are not too great. Even if it is weighed against humanity, how can it be tolerated? Today, the north wind is blowing and the weather is cold outside the Great Wall. Tens of thousands of healthy children have little clothing and food. It is already difficult to support themselves in peacetime. How can they withstand the tigers and wolves in front of them? Ling Ran and others have promised their lives to the country and have long put life and death aside. However, they hope that they will be buried in horseskins. Then they will seek benevolence and gain benevolence. How can they hate? However, they can only watch the loyalty of the entire army not become national heroes but become hungry ghosts. Who has no parents who ordered this? Alas, it can also be said that the hot blood has not frozen, for the survival of the nation and the reputation of the country. It is also necessary to think of Shaokang's journey that can rejuvenate China. If the firearms and supplies are complete, and the medical supplies and cotton clothes are not lacking, it is not difficult to kill the enemy and achieve the goal. It is not difficult to eliminate the great shame and clean up the heinous Japanese slaves. Alas, the country is not built, and disasters arise from strong neighbors. Tianjin Baishan bloodstains are still there. I hope that the people of the country will rise up quickly, do not forget the hatred of not wearing the same sky, and will enthusiastically work together to complete the restoration of the industry. Cry with blood and pillow the spear. I beg all elders, brothers, and overseas Chinese to help and save the country. The nation is fortunate, and the nation is fortunate. October 22nd, Northeast Volunteer Army China-Korea Joint Army Commander Li Lingran, Deputy Commander Jin Decheng, North Road Commander Li Qingtian, West Road Commander Jin Guobao, Ladder Commander Liu Chunjiao, First Road Commander Guan Xiangyang, Second Road Commander Sun Guanying, Third Road Commander Jin Shanhao, Fourth Road Commander Bing Guiwu, Fifth Road Commander Li Dianyi, Sixth Road Commander Li Chunrun, Seventh Road Commander Yan Yu, Eighth Road Commander Lao Beifeng, Ninth Road Commander Liu Zuochen, Special Service Team Captain Zhang Dianhou, K.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Office of the Liaojihei People's Support Association received a telegram from the headquarters' director, stating that, according to Wang Delin's representative, (1) The first detachment, Ma Deshan, attacked Dagu Mountain at 9:00 PM on September 18th and contacted Li's puppet troops and the Japanese army for three days and nights. The enemy was completely surrounded by our army. At 7:00 AM on the 21st, it was officially occupied. At 12:00 PM, all circles hung the blue sky and white sun flag to welcome our army. In this battle, more than a thousand enemies were killed, more than five thousand were injured, more than twenty were captured, more than two hundred and fifty guns were captured, two mortars were captured, and many military supplies were captured. Our army suffered seventeen dead and more than a hundred wounded soldiers. (2) The third detachment, Li Yongchang, and the fifth detachment, Xu Kezheng, attacked Yanghe, Zhuanghe County, at 7:00 PM on September 27th and contacted Li's puppet troops and the Japanese army for one night. The enemy was completely disarmed by our army. Many guns were captured, three mortars were captured, and five machine guns were captured. The commander of the captured enemy army, Yu, was named. Because he was very pro-Japanese, he should be executed to warn the traitors.</p>

<p>Invents Anti-Aircraft Flying Arrow</p>
<p>Please Request Funds from the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Team to Urgently Manufacture</p>
<p>The Association Does Not Know the Truth and Has Sent a Letter to Han Fuqu to Inquire</p>
<p>In recent months, Chinese people have invented many explosive munitions, such as flying mines and flying arrows, which are mostly used to shoot down airplanes for anti-aircraft purposes. However, due to the fact that the inventors and manufacturers are limited by funds, they often use surgery. Sometimes the results are very good, and sometimes they fail during the experiment. Recently, Wang Maoqing from Hebei, who has a long military history, has invented a flying arrow that can shoot 4,000 meters horizontally and 3,000 meters vertically. It is more than enough to shoot down airplanes with it. He has tested it in Jinan, and Han Fuqu is very appreciative. Because of the limited capital, he has been unable to manufacture it on a large scale. Yesterday, he sent a special letter to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Team in Shanghai, requesting funds to be urgently manufactured for the warriors outside the Guan to resist the enemy. The letter is as follows: Respected directors, I am pleased to learn that your association's representatives have repeatedly developed national salvation undertakings and have promoted many more things. I am deeply impressed. However, the situation is evolving, and people have not fully realized their talents. Politics remains the same, and the country has not escaped its difficulties, so that grand plans and great strategies have not been developed. We are all sad. Recently, Wang Maoqing from Hebei Province, who has a long military career and leads artillery troops, and several members of his department (who have all retired) have used the intelligence of the descendants of Yan and Huang to invent an anti-aircraft weapon with great effectiveness, the flying arrow. The raw materials are purely domestic. It can shoot 4,400 meters horizontally and 3,000 meters vertically. The bombing power is around 30 meters to 40 meters. The shape of the gun barrel is similar to an anti-aircraft gun. Each cost is only 25 yuan. Each flying arrow costs 5 yuan (excluding wages). Anti-aircraft is better than anti-aircraft guns, and defending against the enemy is better than mortars and plane-shooting guns. The value is small, the manufacturing is easy, and the effectiveness is great. It is truly the most profitable defensive weapon in the current national crisis. It has been tested several times in Jinan, and everyone exclaimed in wonder. Han Fuqu, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, was very pleased to see the results and decided to build 30 gun barrels and 300 flying arrows. However, the colleagues thought that the people in the Northeast were suffering from the Japanese invaders every day, and the volunteer army lacked anti-aircraft weapons. If they could manufacture some and try to transport them there, the cost would not be much, but the benefit would be great. The current difficulty is that they lack capital to purchase ordinary tools such as machine beds and presses. The current manufacturers are purely handmade, and the production is small and time-consuming. On average, it takes three days of work to manufacture a flying arrow (eight hours a day, for a total of 24 hours). If there is machine manufacturing, it will take less time and produce more. It is planned to ask your association to promote and bring the gun barrels and flying arrows from here to Shanghai for testing. If you are satisfied, you will raise tens of thousands of yuan in capital to choose a site to set up a civilian anti-aircraft flying arrow factory and engage in urgent production specifically for foreign countries. The country is fortunate, and the nation is fortunate. Is it possible to ask for instructions? Liu Yimin, Wang Maoqing, Northeast Volunteer Army Support Team, thanks. The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Team is still unaware of the truth of this matter, so it will first send a letter to Han Fuqu, the chairman of Shandong Province, today to inquire whether it is true, and then try to find a way.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Three Watch Shops Were Bombed Yesterday <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Sun Guangxing Watch Shop, Qipan Street, Sun Guangxing Watch Shop was jointly established by Ningbo merchants. Its manager is Cao Xiaoquan. A month ago, the shop received warning letters from the Anti-Traitor Corps and other groups and published a statement in the newspaper. At around 4:15 PM yesterday, a young man suddenly delivered a warning letter from the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Corps to the shop's counter. All the partners opened it and looked at it. Before they could read a few lines, a bomb suddenly landed outside the door in front of the glass watch cabinet in the shop. It exploded instantly, and iron fragments flew around. All the partners hurriedly dodged. The glass windows displaying watches facing the street on the left and the glass windows of the long glass cabinet on the left in the shop were all destroyed by the explosion. There were also five or six holes in the ceiling. At the same time, a flower seller passing by outside the door was also scratched on his left flank by iron fragments, but it was very light. After the police received the report, they immediately sent detectives to investigate and collected the broken iron fragments and letters and took them to the police station for filing.</p>
<p>Samsung Watch Shop, Fuzhou Road, Samsung Public Concession, also suddenly received a warning letter from the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Corps at around yesterday afternoon. Before long, a bomb flew in from outside the door and hit the wall in the shop's accounting room without exploding. The people in the shop were all pale with fright and immediately reported to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. All the unexploded bombs and warning letters were taken away by the police for filing.</p>
<p>Yuchang Watch Shop, Fuzhou Road, Yuchang Watch Shop also received a warning letter from the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Corps and was thrown a bomb at the same time, which landed near the glass cabinet in the shop. The cabinet was destroyed in the explosion, but no one was injured. Afterwards, the shop denied the incident to the investigators.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Establishment of Branch of the Anti-Civil War Association <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Effective Sanctions</p>
<p>It Is Necessary to Strengthen One's Own Power First</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of the Lu War followed by the Sichuan War, the General Association of the Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance has repeatedly telegraphed to dissuade and dispatched representatives to petition for a cessation of hostilities. However, all efforts have failed to achieve practical results. Therefore, the association deeply feels that in order to seek truly effective methods to stop civil wars, it must first strengthen its own power. It plans to establish branches in major provinces and cities and broadly recruit members, so that when incidents occur, there will be popular support to carry out sanctions. The association's recent progress in establishing branches is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram from Tianjin Branch: The Tianjin branch has now been formally established. After its establishment, the branch sent a telegram to the General Association, stating that foreign aggression is increasingly urgent and the League of Nations is about to discuss the Far East issue. At this critical juncture, how can we bear further civil wars? The Tianjin branch has now been established, and all sectors are enthusiastically supporting it. The press is also willing to unite the national press to collectively advocate. If the people can awaken to the ambitions of the warlords, they can ultimately be restrained. The situation is critical. We hope that the General Association will quickly telegraph the whole country to urge the establishment of branches to facilitate progress. Sincerely, Tianjin Branch.</p>
<p>Actively Preparing for the Establishment of Branches: At the second standing committee meeting of the association, it was resolved to first organize branches in six locations: Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. Respective liaison committee members were designated for preparation. In Beiping: Leng Zhanqi, Zhang Yuanshan, Zhou Zuomin, etc. In Tianjin: Zhang Boling, Yong Jianqiu, etc. In Hankou: Zhou Xingtang, He Hengfu, Li Dezhai, etc. In Nanjing: Pu Yangshan, Wu Yifang, Li Gongpu, etc. In Guangzhou: Cai Chang, Ma Wenhui, etc. In Chongqing: Li Kuian, Mou Pinsan, etc. Apart from Tianjin, which has already been established, the remaining locations have been discussed at daily standing committee meetings, and it was decided to send separate letters to the responsible leaders of local legal organizations, requesting them to work with the designated preparatory members to actively proceed. In addition, in Qingdao and Jinan, Zhang Boling, a standing committee member, once gathered representatives of local organizations to discuss the methods. In Changsha, the preparatory work is being handled by standing committee members Hu Shuhua and Fu Yueqi.</p>
<p>Representatives Depart for Jingzhen: At the seventh daily standing committee meeting of the association, it was decided to publicly recommend Standing Committee Member Liu Zhanen to go to Zhenjiang and Nanjing to contact and urge the business and academic communities in those areas to prepare for the establishment of branches, and to hold lectures or discussions. Mr. Liu is scheduled to depart for Zhenjiang by the early train this morning (25th), leave Zhenjiang for Beijing on the afternoon of the 26th, and return to Shanghai from Beijing on the afternoon of the 27th. The association has sent letters in advance to Standing Committee members Yu Xiaochuan and Lu Xiaobo in Zhenjiang, and Pu Yangshan and Wu Yifang in Nanjing, to arrange for the leaders of local legal organizations to gather and discuss everything at the time.</p>
<h3 id="e31">National Goods Exhibition Closed Yesterday <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Sent a Representative to the Meeting to Deliver a Speech</p>
<p>Exhibits Have Been Reviewed and Awards Will Be Given</p>
<p>The local National Goods Exhibition held a closing ceremony at the Penglai Market in Nanshi at 10:00 AM yesterday. The Director of the Social Affairs Bureau delivered the closing speech, stating that the Review Committee will separately review the exhibits to facilitate the awarding of prizes.</p>
<p>Representatives from All Sectors Attended the Meeting, Including: Mayor Wu Tiecheng's Representative Xu Peihuang, Chen Tian of the Municipal Government, Chief of the Public Security Bureau Wen Hongen, Section Member Wang Guoxian, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Wu Xingya, Section Chief Wu Hengru, Director of the Health Bureau Xu Xingjia, Director of the Land Bureau Jin Kezao, Zhu Yakui of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zheng Letian of the Garrison Headquarters, Zhang Yi of the Shanghai County Farmers' Education Center, Chen Jingrong of the Women's Association for Promoting National Goods, Sun Choucheng of the Shanghai National Goods Factories United Association, Xu Guanghua of the China National Goods Maintenance Association, Chen Yiting of the National Goods Promotion Grand Alliance, Kuang Zhongmou of the Penglai Market, and representatives from manufacturers such as Guanshengyuan, Double Wheel Toothbrush Company, Daxin Leather Goods Company, Taikang Company, China Industrial Society, Da Zhonghua Factory, China Brothers Industrial Society, Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company, Dahua Iron Factory, and Yapu Er Factory, totaling more than 300 people.</p>
<p>The Closing Ceremony: Armed police officers from the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Police Brigade, along with officers from the Second District, Second Branch, maintained order at the venue. At 10:00 AM, the meeting was declared open, with Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Xingya presiding and Chen Dongbai recording. After the customary rituals, the Chairman delivered the closing speech. Mayor Wu's representative, Xu Peihuang, delivered a speech, followed by speeches from Chief of the Public Security Bureau Wen Hongen, Kuang Zhongmou of the Penglai Market, and others. The meeting adjourned at 11:50 AM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Closing Speech: Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Xingya delivered the closing speech, saying, "Distinguished guests, today is the closing ceremony of the National Goods Exhibition. On behalf of the Bureau, I would like to briefly report to everyone the significance of this exhibition. A detailed explanation was given at the opening ceremony, but I would like to add a few points. Although the preparations for this conference were rushed, and all the facilities are inevitably simple, the enthusiastic participation of various organizations and manufacturers in this grand event is far better than in previous years. This proves the awakening of the Chinese people. If we want to save the country, we must promote national goods, develop industry and commerce, and enrich the national economy. Especially today, after the January 28th Incident, the decline of the national economy is even more severe. Today, our conference has held its closing ceremony. After the closing ceremony, I hope that all sectors will pay attention to the manufacturing products after this exhibition. If there are any shortcomings, how should we seek improvements using scientific methods? What kind of goods are needed by the people, but China is still lacking? We should find ways to manufacture and make up for these deficiencies. Furthermore, to make the people of the whole country interested in using national goods, we must start with excellent products and reduce prices. At the same time, the people and the government should cooperate to protect industry and commerce. However, the development of industry and commerce depends on both the development of production and the promotion of sales. If there is developed production without a large sales market, the danger is even greater. However, China is vast, with a large population. As long as we manufacture the goods needed by our own people, the sales market can be solved. However, although we cannot compete with the world's advanced industrial countries in reality, we must always strive to develop and compete with the great powers in spirit after this meeting. I hope that the national industrial and commercial sectors and the people will pay attention together, so as not to let down the great significance of holding this meeting."</p>
<p>Mayor's Representative's Speech: Mayor's representative Xu Peihuang said, "Today, the Mayor has other matters, so he sent me to participate in the closing ceremony of this conference. It should be known that the significance of the National Goods Exhibition is to display national goods from all over the country in one room for everyone to refer to, so that the people know to use national goods, and at the same time, national goods manufacturers can compare each other. The better ones should strive for perfection, and the inferior ones should strive for improvement. The opening ceremony is certainly important, but the closing ceremony is even more important. The so-called closing is only a closing in form. Its significance in promoting and encouraging is not a permanent closing. Therefore, I hope that after the closing, manufacturers should deeply remember the impressions of the exhibition and keep them in their minds. I hope that the exhibition next year will be even better. The people should not only criticize the quality of national goods but also take action and not just talk."</p>
<h3 id="e32">Chinese and Foreign Sundries Industry <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Establishment of a Branch for Promoting National Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Sundries Industry Association is purely an organization of wholesale Chinese and foreign sundries merchants. Therefore, the promotion and sales of national products depend largely on the efforts of this industry. It is heard that the association has organized a branch of the National Goods Promotion Committee of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for the purpose of actively promoting national goods. Cheng Yujie has been publicly elected as the director of the branch, and the personnel for each group have been designated: General Affairs Group: Shi Jingtao, Cao Yifeng; Compilation and Investigation Group: Wang Pingyuan, Gong Xiaoyan; Research Group: Zhu Jingyu, Fang Xiaozhi; Publicity Group: Zhang Heshun, Peng Binghua. Work will begin immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Nanjing Road <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>New National Goods Company Department Store Opens</p>
<p>The former site of the Qihua Company on Nanjing Road, opposite the Hongmiao, has been leased by the Shanghai National Goods Company to open a national goods department store. Preparations have been underway for a month, and the internal work will soon be completed. The company hosted a banquet for dignitaries and national goods manufacturers in the past two days, including Wang Xiao, Lu Wenshao, Mu Ouchu, Fu Xiaoan, Yao Muyun, Wang Binyan, Zhang Weiru, Xiang Shengwu, Xu Yongzuo, Liu Pinsan, Lu Shaotang, Wang Jiean, Chen Yiting, Ji Jiannan, Fang Yixian, and more than 300 manufacturer representatives. First, the general manager of the company, Wu Zhihao, stated the purpose and policy of the establishment, saying: "The import of foreign goods in our country increases year by year, and the outflow of money is countless. The national economic market is almost entirely occupied by imported goods. Shanghai is the commercial hub of the country, and Nanjing Road is the center of the Shanghai market. Most of the shops set up here are calling for imported goods. It is extremely difficult to find a completely national goods store. Therefore, we have raised funds to organize the Shanghai National Goods Company to collect products from famous factories in various places and divide them into silk fabrics, lace, wool fabrics, new ornaments, fine fur goods, hardware sundries, tobacco, wine and food, knitwear, cosmetics, rubber leather goods</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>local products, and more than 20 other sections, including all kinds of national goods. In order to facilitate sellers, we have invited the Ningbo Industrial Bank to set up a savings department in the venue. We will also set up wholesale, communication, and foreign trade departments on the third floor. We hope that national goods can gradually advance and reach the point where there are national goods companies all over China." Wang Xiao, Chen Yiting, Wang Jiean and others then made various contributions and plans.</p>
<h3 id="e34">City Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Woolen Mill Industry <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Encouraging the Imitation of Serge and Woolen Fabrics</p>
<p>Starting with Those That Are Easier to Imitate</p>
<p>Yesterday, the City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Woolen Mill Industry Association, stating: "Respectfully, we received a letter from the Footwear Industry Association stating that on October 8th, your Chamber sent a letter stating, 'Now, the National Goods Promotion Committee of our Chamber, Director Fang Jiaobo, has sent a letter with the minutes of the third meeting, in which the second item states, "We are sending a letter to the industry associations of each industry to find out the names and uses of national products in their industry that can replace foreign goods and reply within this month for promotion purposes," which was submitted to the 14th Standing Committee meeting and resolved to handle it accordingly. Therefore, we hereby submit this matter, as we are not specialized in manufacturing and have no products that can replace foreign goods. The Executive Committee claimed after discussing under the Fourth Executive Committee Meeting that before the anti-Japanese boycott movement in Shanghai, the industry had been using a type of lake green leather, lead wire nails, hemp thread, and other items. These were all Japanese goods. Now, they are all replaced by domestic goods. Hatred of goods must have disappeared. It has been found that the shoe upper serge, tribute, and felt, black velvet used for winter warm shoes all come from Europe and the West, and their sales are the widest, which is very concerning. If we consider our country's current situation, the footwear material used in the prosperous area of Shanghai during the late Qing Dynasty was Nanjing-produced satin damask, but it was fragile and easy to tear, and it was easy to fluff and get dirty. By the early years of the Republic of China, Europe and the West released a new type of woolen material tribute serge and winter shoes using felt and black velvet. It has a soft texture and no fragility or fluffing defect. We experimented with making shoe materials and were quite welcome by customers, so the market for tribute suddenly been taken over by wool from imported goods. The reason for this is that our country is sticking to old ways and industry does not know how to improve. The pain in the heart is even shoes for life are essential, with the largest number of sales. It is necessary to address is the leak, it will be difficult to make up for the situation. Extravagant talks about invigorating industry and promoting national goods are empty words and cannot make up for it. We should ask your Association to pay attention to raising funds to organize woolen mills and improve their products so that they can stop the leakage. So, to promote national goods will not be just empty words, this is a very important matter." The woolen mill industry in this city has several of them. Rather than re-raising funds to start a business, as the Association said, it seems better to ask the existing factories to study imitation or improve them, which is more cost-effective and labor-saving. After all, can the factories in this city find ways to imitate or make improvements on all kinds of wool? The factories of your Association should be invited to carefully discuss with the factories. If they are limited by technology or capital, they may work together to start with those that are easier to imitate in order to save the leakage. Hopefully, the promotion of national goods will not be an empty slogan.</p>
<h3 id="e35">City Health Bureau Director <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Li Ting'an Arrived at the Bureau Yesterday to Take Office</p>
<p>Original Staff Will Not Be Changed</p>
<p>The newly appointed Director of the City Health Bureau, Mr. Li Ting'an, arrived at the Bureau at around 9:00 AM yesterday to take office. First, the acting director, Shen Gao, handed over the seals and other important cases for acceptance. He then summoned all the staff to hold a memorial week. After the rituals, Director Li began to address all the staff. The content can be roughly divided into the following points: (1) Stating that he will not change the original staff and hopes that everyone can work with peace of mind. (2) This time, he was ordered to head the city's health efforts and will continue the unfinished business of former Director Hu, and will follow Mayor Wu's orders at any time to expand the city's health undertakings. (3) He hopes that all staff should work diligently and honestly. After the speech, he announced the adjournment and summoned the section chiefs to lead the staff of each section to the Director's office for separate instructions. According to Li's words to the Central News Agency reporter, although he has not been in Shanghai for long, he is well aware that the Shanghai urban area lacks large-scale hospitals. In the future, he will do his best to create benefits for the poor and sick, and plans to meet with the health authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession to establish contact. The Peking Union Medical College has canceled its subsidy of more than 20,000 yuan per year to the Shanghai health budget two years ago.</p>

<p>Zeng Zesheng Promoted to Deputy Director</p>
<p>The position of Director of the Shanghai Municipal Security Office was originally held concurrently by Mayor Wu. Because Mayor Wu's official duties are busy and he has recently suffered from bronchitis, although he has consulted doctors and taken medicine, he has not fully recovered. He has neither the time nor the energy to concurrently hold the position of Director of the Security Office. At the beginning of this month, he recommended Yang Hu to the Military Affairs Commission to succeed him as Director of the Shanghai Municipal Security Office. It has been approved. The Municipal Government officially announced it yesterday and promoted the original Director of the Security Office, Zeng Zesheng, to Deputy Director of the Office. After receiving the order, Mr. Yang visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss various issues related to the Security Office. Yang Hu, courtesy name Xiaotian, is from Ningguo County, Anhui Province. He has served as the Chief of the Special Affairs Office of the Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army, the Commander of the Shanghai Garrison, and the Advisor to the National Government. He is currently a member of the Central Supervisory Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e37">American Aviator Passed Through Shanghai En Route to Japan <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to Return to Shanghai Next Sunday</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that Lowe, Vice President and Director of the International Department of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, a major American film company, arrived in Shanghai on the "Spirit of the Game" airplane at 11:25 AM yesterday (23rd) and took the Japanese Empress ship to Kobe in the afternoon. MGM Far East Manager Chamberlain accompanied him. He is scheduled to inspect the Japanese film industry and return to Shanghai around next Sunday. On the first of next month, he will take a plane again and take the road to Africa via India for a long trip of 27,000 miles. According to Lawyer Rostell, who accompanied Mr. Lowe, when they departed from New York, they contacted the Japanese government for permission for their plane to enter the country. They repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese authorities during the trip, but were rejected. Therefore, Mr. Lowe had to abandon the plane and take a boat to Japan. Since the American aviators Pangbang and Handun suspended their global flight in Vladivostok last summer and were invited by a Tokyo newspaper to fly to Tokyo, they were detained for several months by the Japanese authorities for flying over fortress areas. Since their release, no American aircraft has been allowed to land in Japan. This time, after taking a ship from San Francisco to Melbourne, Australia, they took a plane from Melbourne last Monday, passing through Java, Singapore, Penang, Bangkok, Hanoi, and Hong Kong, and arrived in Shanghai. It only took six days from Australia to Shanghai. After that, they will depart from Shanghai and take the road through Hong Kong, Vietnam, Burma, India, Persia, Asia Minor, and Khartoum, and then follow the British Imperial Airways south to Africa. They will go to Johannesburg to attend the opening ceremony of a theater, then go south to Cape Town, South Africa, and then return north, passing through the countries of Europe to reach London. They plan to return to the United States on the French Island ship on November 30.</p>

<p>Guanglu Left Shanghai Yesterday to Return to His Post</p>
<p>Mr. Wei, a consultant of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, was appointed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the Resident Consul in Zaisan, Soviet Union in the 18th year of the Republic. The Legislative Yuan hired him as a member of the Legislative Yuan to attract talent two years ago. Mr. Guang immediately returned to China from Russia and took office in Beijing. The Consul assigned someone to act as his agent. Now that Mr. Guang's term as a member of the Legislative Yuan is about to expire, he has resigned from the Legislative Yuan. He came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to take care of personal matters. He completed his work yesterday and went north last night, first to Vladivostok, and then took the Siberian Railway train to Zaisan, Central Asia, to return to his original consular post.</p>

<p>New Sound News said that the commander of the Japanese Third Fleet stationed in Shanghai, Sakonji Seizo, has been transferred to Sasebo Naval Base Commander. His vacancy will be filled by Takahashi Sankichi, Deputy Minister of the Military. It is said that Takahashi is a relatively peaceful person.

<p>Hangzhou People Discussed Assisting the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Chu Huiseng, the representative sent by the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association to Hangzhou to contact the City Chamber of Commerce and the Lawyers Association on the issue of organizing the Zhejiang Province Volunteer Army Support Association, returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday. According to a reporter from Our Country News Agency, when the 19th Route Army fought against the Japanese in Shanghai, there was an organization of voluntary donations in the people of that city. For a time, the wind and clouds rose, and branches spread throughout the provinces and counties. Since the signing of a peace treaty, the association has been suspended in an intangible way and has not explicitly announced its end. Therefore, in addition to contacting Jin Runquan, Wang Xiangquan, and Vice President Huang of the Lawyers Association, etc., in this trip to Hangzhou, he also contacted Mr. Wang Tingyang of the voluntary donation association, and there was a strong argument to revitalize the old name of the voluntary donation association and start publicity again, without having to start another new organization. However, it has not been confirmed. The various circles are jointly discussing and proceeding. Therefore, although there is no obvious achievement in this trip, it is not in vain to arouse the attention of the Hangzhou people.</p>

<p>Opposing Telephone Price Increase Reasons</p>
<p>Based on Anson's Letter, Please Convey to the Board of Directors</p>
<p>The Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, based on Anson's letter published in the Public Works Department Gazette, proves that users oppose the telephone price increase in the current economic situation in Shanghai. It specially sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department requesting him to convey it to the Board of Directors. The original letter said: "Respectfully, the October 21st Public Works Department Gazette contains Anson's letter to your Director-General regarding the telephone price increase. After reviewing the first sentence of the third paragraph of Anson's letter, 'Our Association is willing to give the same importance to your Bureau.' According to Anson's opinion, the telephone price should be higher than 25%, but he admits that this opinion does not take into account the changes in the economic situation in Shanghai during this period.' It can be seen from Anson's intention that the telephone price increase should take into account the economic situation. The economic situation in Shanghai now is not as good as before January 28 this year, and it is even worse than when Anson prepared the report in the 18th year of the Republic of China. Your Director-General cannot and does not want to deny this observation. This letter from Anson further proves that telephone users oppose the price increase under this economic downturn for good reason. Correspondingly, we request your Director-General to convey it to the Board of Directors. Sincerely, Director-General of the Public Concession Public Works Department."</p>

<p>Transferring Old Uniforms to Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Adding a Mark to Avoid Parading</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of disaster relief in disaster areas such as Northeast and Henan provinces, Mr. Zhu Ziqiao telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to instruct all railway bureaus to raise donations. In addition to ordering all railway bureaus to raise donations within their capabilities, the Ministry of Railways also considered that the disaster situation in various provinces is serious and in urgent need of relief. It is feared that the donations raised will not be enough to meet the needs, and the old uniforms stored by the railways over the years must be quite a few. It is a pity to abandon them. It is better to transfer them for relief. However, after they are distributed, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no bad people who wear them and take the opportunity to parade. We must be cautious from the beginning and stipulate that a large mark be added to this item of old uniforms to identify them. The Ministry of Railways specially telegraphed all railway bureaus the day before yesterday to quickly list all old uniforms, whether they are single, double, woolen, cotton, coats, trousers, and report them to the Ministry for overall planning, designating distribution locations and adding marking styles, so that they can be transported separately to various provinces for distribution to provide winter relief and the gospel of the people in the disaster area.</p>

<p>The Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association believes that the Western detectives and Russian detectives rushed to arrest the robbers in the Wang's house robbery case in Taoyuanfang, North Jiangxi Road, regardless of their lives, and were injured in the line of duty. The association specially sent a letter to the Director-General of the ｜ Department Bureau requesting him to convey condolences. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, it is reported that at around 8:00 AM on October 14, five robbers robbed Wang Shao's house at No. 123, Taoyuanfang, North Jiangxi Road. The Western detective of No. 377 and the Chinese detective reported it to the head of the detective room, who immediately ordered Western detective Hui Dingqike and Russian detective Weidaifu to lead several Chinese detectives to go by car to arrest them. All of them disregarded their lives and killed three robbers on the spot, and two other robbers were wounded and arrested. The Russian and Western detectives were also dared to be shot at by the robbers and were injured in the line of duty. This Association is very grateful for such dedication by the detectives to protect the interests of taxpayers. Correspondingly, we request your Bureau to convey your condolences, which is a public friendship. Sincerely, Director-General of the Public Concession Public Works Department."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Society recently received a letter from Director Li Yunmen in Nanchang, stating that the stone embankment section of Futouwei Tiexian Lake was completed on the 2nd of this month, and 70% of the dam soil has been excavated. The project is substantial, and there are no floating expenses. The local people, especially the farmers, are very grateful, which is gratifying. On the 5th, he inspected the Niuwei Sluice Gate at Dayouwei, and on the 8th, he returned to the province to arrange everything at Yinjiatang in Futouwei, which has also started excavation of the foundations. Eighty percent of the gravel required for these two sections has been purchased and transported, and timber is currently being transported for piling. With sunny weather, work is being accelerated, and it is estimated that the entire project can be completed within two months. The benefits to farmland from the completion of this section will be even greater. The previously brought relief funds have been withdrawn from the Nanchang branch of the Bank of China for 2,000 yuan. The late rice here has recently been harvested and is more abundant than in previous years. However, the rice price is too low, with each stone of rice priced at about 2 yuan, which inevitably causes farmers to suffer in secret. Knowing that the attention is not relaxed, I respectfully submit this report. China is founded on agriculture, and it is necessary to diligently repair water conservancy and build embankments and ponds to reduce disasters and increase production to save the bankrupt rural economy. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will rise up to assist in the completion of the projects to be repaired everywhere.</p>

<p>National Vessels Severely Affected</p>
<p>The shipping industry in Shanghai received news from Yingkou that the Yu Da Company, a shipping company run by Chinese in Yingkou, has three ships that operate from the Northeast to Shanghai and various ports in Beiyang. A false organization, using the excuse that the company is run by Bao Yucai, the son of Bao Gui, an important figure in the Northeast, has specially dispatched two commissioners to the company to monitor it. Regarding business operations, they are still allowed to operate, but in terms of sovereignty, they are taking an interventionist approach. However, they are strictly keeping it secret from the outside world, and even the Shanghai branch is not being informed of the inside story. This is just the first step of their actions. Since this incident occurred, the national shipping companies in Yingkou and Andong have been quite disheartened.</p>

<p>After Chairman Lin arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, people from all walks of life continued to visit him, making him very busy. However, Chairman Lin's love for art stems from his innate nature. It is heard that the Liu Haisu Art Exhibition hosted by the Municipal Government has not yet closed, so yesterday (the 24th) at 1:00 PM, he went to the Ings Memorial Hall to view the Liu Haisu Art Exhibition in detail. He especially praised several works in the first part, "Chinese Painting," such as "Ink Lion," "Great Pine," and "Eagle," for their majestic vitality that others could not match. In the second part, "Pre-European Travel Works," such as "Qianmen" and "Leifeng Pagoda," he praised the paintings' simple and solid colors and magnificent atmosphere. Later, in the third part, "Works of European Travel," he lingered in each room, pointing to masterpieces such as "Sunset at Notre Dame," "Ancient Rome," "Roman Colosseum," and "The Thinker," calling them "noble in style and magnificent in power, enough to awaken the decadent spirit. This not only expresses the artist's personality but also has a huge impact on social culture, enough to advocate the origins of ancient academic thought and to inspire future generations to follow." After viewing all the sections, the office telegraphed Mr. Liu Haisu to come, and Mr. Liu warmly received him in the reception room and presented him with a copy of "Haisu Series," newly published by the Chung Hwa Book Company, before they parted. On the same day, more than a thousand people, including celebrities Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Yin Zhufu, and Li Dazhang, Tang Xulin, and Wang Guanghui, who came to Shanghai from Nanjing specifically for the exhibition, visited the exhibition.</p>

<p>Father's Obituary of a Lawsuit Monger</p>
<p>Numerous Important Figures Write Praises</p>
<p>Reprinted from Ye Huiduo's Obituary</p>
<p>Chiang, Lin, Wang, and Sun All Wrote Extensively</p>
<p>Chiang Ordered an Arrest After Receiving a Secret Report</p>
<p>The Person Is on the Run, a Large Number of Obituaries Seized</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court heard a peculiar case. The facts were that a Zheng surname from Shaoxing forged an obituary, reprinted praises and inscriptions from important figures of the party and the state, and swindled money under false pretenses. He was secretly accused to Chiang, the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission in Hankou. Chairman Chiang secretly ordered Mayor Wu Tiecheng to thoroughly investigate the case. Mayor Wu ordered Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau to send personnel to the residence of the Zheng surname along with the police to seize a large number of forged exhibits. However, the Zheng surname had already fled upon hearing the news. Yesterday, the First Special Court held a hearing and decided to temporarily hand over the seized exhibits to the Public Security Bureau for safekeeping, pending the arrest of Zheng to verify the case. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Zheng Wenxiang, also known as Zheng Qifeng, a Shaoxing native, residing at No. 7 Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road, Public Concession, specializes in lawsuit mongering. He has a "Law Office for the Protection of Human Rights" set up in his residence. There are more than ten listed lawyers, all of whom are the best among Shanghai lawyers. The interior is decorated magnificently, resembling a wealthy businessman's villa. Throughout the day, it is filled with distinguished guests and visitors, resembling Mengchang's three thousand retainers.</p>
<p>Father's Obituary: At the beginning of this month, Zheng suddenly issued a large number of obituaries, roughly stating that "My late father, Duke Dehe, passed away at the residence in the countryside due to illness at the hour of Chou on the 19th day of the twelfth month of the lunar calendar in the 20th year of the Republic of China, at the age of 59. We have carefully selected the 8th day of the tenth month (November 5th) for burial in Shanbei and have chosen the 16th day of the tenth month (the 17th day of the ninth month in the lunar calendar) to receive condolences at the Fuxing Garden Restaurant on Pingwang Street, Wuma Road." The obituary was printed on a four-fold hardcover paper and was artistically designed.</p>
<p>Important Figures' Praises: The most noteworthy thing in the obituary is the portrait of Zheng's father in the center of the cover. At the top is "Portrait of Mr. Zheng Dehe" inscribed by Cai Yuanpei, and below the portrait are the four characters "Benevolent Heart and Heroic Spirit" inscribed by Chiang, the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, in seal script, with "Mr. Dehe Forever" signed above and "Chiang Kai-shek" signed below. The second page is personally inscribed by Chairman Lin of the National Government with "Merit Remains in the Republic," the third page is inscribed by Sun Ke with "Name Resounds in Shanghai," and the last page is inscribed by General Cai Tingkai with twelve sentences of praise. At the bottom is inscribed by Wang Zhaoming with "Heroic Demeanor Still Remains." Each person's name is followed by a vermilion seal.</p>
<p>Secret Accusation of Forgery: Unexpectedly, after Zheng's obituary was issued, someone saw through that the obituary was forged, intending to swindle money under false pretenses, and secretly accused Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau. Director Wen was initially hesitant and secretly ordered the Detective Team to thoroughly investigate. While the investigation was underway, the Municipal Government suddenly received a secret order from Chiang, the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission in Hankou, along with a copy of the obituary of the late Shanghai gentleman Ye Huijun and Zheng's obituary.</p>
<p>Replacing One With Another: Chairman Chiang's letter roughly stated that he had received a secret accusation that Zheng Wenxiang, a Shaoxing native residing at No. 7 Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road, Public Concession, had illegally used the inscriptions and seals of important figures of the party and the state, and issued obituaries indiscriminately, intending to swindle money under false pretenses. He also attached a copy of Zheng's forged obituary, requesting an arrest. After investigation, it was found that Zheng's obituary was indeed a forgery, completely reprinted from the obituary of the late Shanghai gentleman Ye Huijun. After comparison, except for "Portrait of Mr. Zheng Dehe" inscribed by Central Committee Member Cai Yuanpei, which was completely forged, and "Heroic Demeanor Still Remains" inscribed by President Wang, which was reprinted from the obituary of Secretary-General Chu Minyi, the rest was completely identical and reprinted.</p>
<p>Investigation Without Success: The letter concluded by ordering the Municipal Government to investigate and handle the matter properly. After receiving the order, Mayor Wu immediately handed it over to Director Wen, who ordered the Detective Team to send personnel to the residence of Zheng on Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road, along with the Chinese and foreign detectives in charge. However, Zheng had already fled upon hearing the news, and a large number of unfinished forged obituaries and a copy of Ye Huijun's real obituary were seized on the spot.</p>
<p>Verification After Capture: The seized evidence was immediately escorted to the police station and transferred to the First Special District Court. The case was heard yesterday morning in the Eighth Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Because Zheng had not been captured, the evidence was temporarily handed over to Qi Haitian, the leader of the Detective Team of the Public Security Bureau, for safekeeping, pending the arrest of the suspect Zheng for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Wu Huaichun <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Case of Defiling Sisters</p>
<p>The Younger Sister Died First, and the Elder Sister Was Abandoned</p>
<p>The Hearing Was Held Yesterday, With Both Sides Giving Their Accounts</p>
<p>The Case Was Postponed Because Shi Chen Was Not Present</p>
<p>The Judge Ordered Wu to Appear in Court Next Time</p>
<p>Wu Huaichun, who resides in Yinyu Company at No. 24 Jiwufang, Ximen Road, was recently accused by Shi Chen, a woman from Changshu, of raping her second daughter, Lingyu, causing her death, and of raping, abducting, and abandoning her eldest daughter, Jinghua. Lawyers Wu Peng and He Yijun filed a lawsuit against him in the Second Special District Court for the above crimes. Yesterday was the date for the hearing of this case. Judge Li Changnian summoned both parties to the First Tribunal for questioning. Since the plaintiff, Shi Chen, was ill and did not appear in court, Shi Jinghua first stated that she is 19 years old, from Changshu, and currently resides in the home of relatives in Dexingli, North Sichuan Road. Her sister initially came to Shanghai with relatives to learn opera. After that, her whereabouts were unknown. In April of this year, she received a letter from her sister saying that she was ill in Shanghai, so her mother first came to Shanghai, and then she came to Shanghai, to take care of her sister's illness. On April 16 of this year, her mother went to the countryside to get clothes. At that time, she took care of her sister day and night and had not closed her eyes for six or seven nights. On April 24, Wu Huaichun said that such hard work might cause her to get sick, so he asked her to go to sleep peacefully tonight, and he would accompany her.</p>
<p>Wu then committed indecency. At that time, she was only wearing a pair of underpants. When she woke up, she was being pressed down by him. She wanted to scream, but Wu said that if her sister heard it, she would definitely die of anger, so she endured in silence. Her sister was four years younger than her and was only 15 years old this year. She initially lived in Fan Guilins house. Her mother knew Fan, and the relationship between Fan and Wu started this year. Her sister actually died because of the rape. Wu initially tricked her into marrying him, but she refused. Wu said that if she did not agree, they would die together. On the 15th day of the seventh lunar month, Wu went to Kunshan to pay respects to her sister's grave and then came to Shanghai to live in the Wuling Apartment for a total of one month and one day. At that time, her mother did not come with her, and she lived alone at night. Wu came at six o'clock in the morning and went to sleep again and came to accompany her in the evening and did not leave until ten o'clock because his family limited him to returning home by ten o'clock every night. After that, Wu did not come. On August 14, the Wuling Apartment accountant informed her that the room had expired, so she had no choice but to return home. She did not borrow money from him. The expenses in the apartment were paid by him, and there are invoices to prove it. She heard that Wu went to play in the business every day after that, so he did not come. Therefore, she is requesting</p>
<p>to prosecute him for the crime of rape and abandonment and for the death of her sister due to rape. Then, according to Wu Huaichun's statement, he is 47 years old, from Suzhou, and is a rental accountant for Yinyu Company, residing at No. 24 Jiwufang, Ximen Road. He met her sister, named Yunzhen (i.e., Lingyu), last year. She lived at No. 2 Zengrongli, Aige Road, doing business. Since No. 2 was Han Zhuang, he did not go there for a long time after he met Yunzhen in July last year.</p>
<p>This year, he went to play again and saw that Yunzhen was ill. Her illness was a cough. He then advised her family to seek medical treatment and rest quietly. At that time, Shi Chen was also in Shanghai. Around the 20th of March, Shi Chen said that it was not suitable to live here and begged him to find a place to recuperate, so he helped her move to the nearby Shiyinli. At that time, Fan Guilin said that Yunzhen was 18 years old, but Shi herself said that she was 15 years old. During her illness, he helped her seek medical treatment and often went there during the day. Later, Yunzhen's illness became more serious. Because Yunzhen had pledged 300 yuan to Fan, Fan saw that her illness was getting worse and came to ask for the money. Shi Chen then discussed it with him, and he lent her 300 yuan as a</p>
<p>future concubine. He also vaguely agreed. Later, she went to the Red Cross Hospital and died soon after. He had no physical relationship with Jinghua. Because he did not go to her house at night, she came to see her sister, which was the case. Besides, Yunzhen and her mother were both present. Wuling Apartment was rented for Jinghua to come to Shanghai to worship Yunzhen in the seventh lunar month at her request. At first, she said that she would stay for a few days, then she stayed for one month and one day, and he could not interfere. The expenses in Wuling Apartment were given to her for 50 yuan, and she lived alone. He did not live with her. He did not know Jinghua before because she came on May 9 to</p>
<p>see her sister's illness before they met. She once asked him</p>
<p>for a thousand yuan but he did not agree and asked him to recommend business for her fiancé, which he also did not agree to. He was afraid that she would hold a grudge because of this. Then, Judge Li ordered that the case was complicated, and Shi Chen was not present today, so the hearing was postponed, and he strictly ordered the defendant Wu Huaichun to appear in court next time, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<p>[P Special Police's Home Robbed&gt;</p>
<p>Two Chinese Police Officers Rushed to the Scene Upon Hearing the Whistle</p>
<p>One Police Officer Was Injured, and the Thieves Fled in All Directions</p>
<p>Cai Liufu, a special police officer at the Xinzha Police Station in the Public Concession of Shanghai, lived at No. 281 Binlang Road. Yesterday at 6:20 PM, when Cai happened to be out, four robbers suddenly came to his house, each holding a handgun. Two thieves guarded the gate, and two thieves went inside, first confining his family members in a room and threatening them not to make a sound, and then began to search. Unexpectedly, one of his family members was not confined and secretly ran upstairs to take refuge in the east wing. They pushed open the window facing the street, frantically blew the whistle, and shouted "Catch the robbers!" Upon hearing the sound, the robbers panicked and quickly abandoned their belongings and fled through the gate. At this time, two patrolling Chinese police officers, No. 1478 and No. 14, happened to be passing by Putuo Road and heard the whistle and rushed to the scene. When the robbers saw them, they quickly pulled out their guns and fired four shots at them. Chinese police officer No. 14 could not dodge in time and was shot in the right waist. At the same time, a Chen surname man and a woman passing by the roadside were also injured by stray bullets in their hands. The robbers then fled in all directions. Chinese police officer No. 1478 chased after them but failed to catch them and returned to the original location to send Chinese police officer No. 14 to the police station to report everything and sent the injured men and women to Baolong and Guangren Hospitals for treatment. The injured Chinese police officer was transferred from the Putuo Road Police Station to the Police Hospital for treatment, and detectives were dispatched to pursue the robbers and investigate the case.</p>

<p>Newcomer Yu Lianquan Amazes Everyone</p>
<p>The Chinese team of the Shanghai International Merchant Corps held its July and August monthly cup shooting competition at the Hongkou shooting range yesterday morning. A large number of team members of all levels attended the event, competing fiercely and showing their skills. The events of the day were 200-yard prone shooting at a small moon target, 200-yard prone shooting at a large moon moving target, and 300-yard standing shooting with a fast gun. The targets were small and fleeting, and the pressure and wind were uncertain at dawn, making it even more difficult to grasp. As a result, the performance of the new team member Mr. Yu Lianquan was the best, and his shooting score even surpassed the special class, winning the July and August championship of the new recruits class. It is said that Mr. Yu has only been in the team for two months and has achieved such amazing results, which can be called a rising star.

<p>Promoting Popular Trust Knowledge Movement</p>
<p>The trust business is an important economic system for developing assets and encouraging savings. It is almost well-known in European and American countries. However, the meaning of trust is not yet clear to the Chinese people, and there are many misunderstandings, which greatly hinder the development of individual and social economy. Puyi Trust Company, in view of this, took the lead in establishing a formal trust company in Shanghai and has been actively carrying out various trust businesses over the years. In order to expand its service scope, it has specially hired Mr. Hu Yigu, the former editor-in-chief and author of the Youth Association, to be responsible for promoting the popular trust knowledge movement and to compile trust industry books in both Chinese and English and other publications for research in all walks of life. It is determined to make trust knowledge popular throughout the society so that most people can get economic assistance. It is reported that the following six types are already being compiled: (1) Outline of Trust (2) Will and Property Management Law (3) Livelihood Trust (4) Life Insurance Trust (5) Commercial Insurance Trust (6) Custody and Agency Business. The meaning and value of various trusts are explained in detail in the above books, which are unprecedented reading materials in the society. The first type, "Outline of Trust," has now been published. Anyone who is interested in research can formally send a letter stating their name, address, and occupation to the company at No. 29 Nanjing Road for reading.</p>

<p>Cracking Down on Coolies and Beggar Bosses Extorting Money</p>
<p>Shanghai County Government Announcement: Concerning the matter of an announcement, on the 15th of this month, the 30th district head meeting reported that the 5th district head, Xing Zhigang, proposed that the coolie associations in various townships, commonly known as industry associations, carry goods and arbitrarily charge high prices, relying on their numbers to coerce. Furthermore, during weddings and funerals in the countryside, they take the opportunity to divide up sections of land and hoard them. There are also beggar bosses who, regardless of weddings or construction, demand money. If they fail, they lead a group of beggars to the door to extort money, occupy the premises and refuse to leave, or seize food, causing all kinds of disturbances. The district learned that during the funeral of Yang Fusheng's son in Shangchun, the coolies from Chenxing Town went to Yang's house to freeload, gathered eight people, falsely claimed to be funeral palanquins, and volunteered themselves. The family provided them with food, and they all became drunk and disorderly, smashing dishes and plates in the kitchen because there was no food. Furthermore, when Sun Yunlong died in Qiaozhen, eight people from the funeral palanquin went to Sun's house and became drunk. The place was extremely small, but the coolies, regardless of the situation, occupied the hall and refused to leave. Such false extortion has long been severely prohibited in the Qing Dynasty, let alone under the flag of the Republic of China. In July of the tenth year of the Republic of China, the county government issued a notice to investigate and prohibit it. Now, after a long period of time, people are taking it lightly again. The winter season of weddings and funerals is approaching, and they may still repeat the old tricks and disturb the local area. Can we refer to the previous case and reiterate the strict prohibition, and publicly decide to implement it? After discussion, it was decided that the county government would issue an announcement and distribute it to various districts for prohibition. It is recorded that coolies and beggar bosses falsely extorting money and causing disturbances are indeed disrupting public safety and should be strictly prohibited to ensure peace. In addition to issuing orders to various district offices and public security bureaus to comply with the investigation and prohibition, this announcement is made to inform everyone. If any coolies or beggar bosses are found to be extorting money or causing disturbances from shops or residents, they will be immediately arrested and punished without leniency. Everyone must abide by this and not violate it. This announcement is hereby made.</p>

<p>During the January 28th Songhu Battle, the Jiangwan Epidemic Hospital opened the Red Cross Society's 15th Injured Soldiers Hospital and organized 13 rescue teams, treating a total of more than 500 people. After the war subsided, the Jiangwan Chongshan Hall organized a burial team to collect and bury more than 1,500 bodies of soldiers and civilians. They were enthusiastic about their work and sacrificed for the country. It is appropriate to commend them. Yesterday, a public letter was received from the headquarters of the 19th Route Army in Fujian, stating that Wang Hanli and others, 10 staff members of the 15th Injured Soldiers Hospital and 13 rescue teams, and Lu Rensheng and others, 10 staff members of the Jiangwan Chongshan Hall burial team, were enthusiastic in their service.

<p>Long-Distance Bus Driver Beaten</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company took over the Baoshan City Songjiang-Yangxing long-distance bus, the business has been smooth. However, the company's regulations stipulate that soldiers wearing uniforms only need to purchase half-price tickets, otherwise, if they do not have a free ticket, they must purchase tickets as usual. The day before yesterday morning, a soldier from Wusong to Baoshan was wearing a uniform but had no symbols and did not purchase a half-price ticket. He insisted on boarding the bus, and the ticket inspector politely dissuaded him. The soldier was resentful. Yesterday afternoon, at about 3:00 p.m., he gathered seven or eight companions and saw the bus driving from Yangxing to Baoshan being stopped by the soldiers near Sanguantang. The driver, Yu Chunquan, was dragged out of the bus and beaten with wooden sticks. Yu immediately fell to the ground, barely breathing. Later, he was sent to the hospital by someone. The assailants dispersed after their goal was achieved.</p>

<p>Murderer of Detective Arrested</p>
<p>Multiple People Detained and a Handgun Confiscated</p>
<p>Hua Tanmu, Shang Wu, of the Huisi Detective Office, received a report on the 22nd of this month that there were many thieves inside the Changchun Tea Garden at No. 703 Tiantong Road. He led detectives Zhao Xiaohe, Huang Aqing, and Yin Ali to arrest them at about 10:00 a.m. However, one of the thieves was armed and opened fire upon seeing the detectives. Detective Shang was quick and fell to the ground to avoid the bullets, but Zhao Xiaohe was killed on the spot, and Huang and Yi were seriously injured. The murderers escaped into the crowd. The details have been previously reported in this newspaper. After the case occurred, all the detective offices paid attention to it. Hua Tanzhang, Su Changsheng, and Detective Zhou Guisheng of the Laozha Detective Office learned that the murderer in this case was Jiangbei native Yin Xinren, who was hiding at No. 46, Lane 603, Kangnaot Road, West Shanghai. They rushed to arrest Yin, along with accomplices Wang Bingnan, Zhou Fengshan, Zhao Yuzhen, Xu Mingcai, Ding Arong, Luo Xinmin, and others, all natives of Jiangbei, and a handgun and three bullets, and brought them back to the detective office. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Division. The detective office's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested permission for detention because the case had not yet been investigated. Yin Xinren also confessed to opening fire to resist arrest. Judge Qian Hongye approved the detective office's request and ordered the defendants to be returned for further questioning. The corpse of Zhao Xiaohe was also inspected by the Special Court's Prosecutor Zhan Liangce, who confirmed that he had been shot and killed, and ordered his sister, Shen Zhao, to claim the body for coffin burial.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Pimping and Kidnapping of Wuxi Female Workers Sentenced <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Li Xubai from Wuxi, Fang Zhongkun from Nanjing, Chen Ziying from Guangdong, and Zhu Zhang from Nanjing, recently lured Wuxi Lihua Weaving Factory female workers Wu Shouying and Wu Xiaomei to Shanghai and hid them in the Zhiyuan Hotel on Tianjin Road. Li and Fang forcibly raped them and planned to sell them to a brothel run by local woman Li Liu on Fuzhou Road. The case was uncovered and the men and women were arrested. The two women were temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute pending review. This was previously reported. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu opened the court to continue the hearing. The detective office's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the case was being rescheduled. Detectives searched the hotel where they were staying and found a letter from Zhu Zhang to Fang Zhongkun, stating that Fang had embezzled 40 yuan from a previous human trafficking case, so she was demanding it. From this, it can be seen that the defendants specialize in luring good women into prostitution and should be severely punished. He presented the seized letter as evidence. The defendant Li Xubai cunningly denied that the two women were sisters or close acquaintances, and said they did not work in Lihua and were actually private prostitutes. However, the two women denounced his words in court as pure fabrication. Fang Zhongkun claimed that Li only said that Wu Shouying was his wife and Xiaomei was a relative, and denied that the letter was written by him. Chen Ziying's testimony was also evasive. Zhu Zhang admitted to writing the letter to Fang to demand debt. Li Liu denied everything. As a result, Judge Fu sentenced Li and Fang to five years of imprisonment each, Chen Ziying and Zhu Zhang to three years of imprisonment each, and Li Liu to two months of imprisonment. Wu Shouying and Wu Xiaomei were sent to the Women and Children Relief Association. The letters were confiscated.</p>

<p>Rent Reduction Appeal Dismissed</p>
<p>British-owned Aierd Foreign Company argued that the central area of the Public Concession was safe during the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, so it could not accept the Tongchunfang tenants' request for rent reduction for February and March, and immediately filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court. The initial trial resulted in a judgment that the tenants should pay the original claim amount and bear the litigation costs. More than a dozen tenants, including the Children's Bookstore, were unwilling to accept this and hired lawyer Yao Junying to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. The hearing was held last Monday, and lawyers Chen Zhongyin and Wu Linkun represented the defendants. The hearing concluded, and the judgment was scheduled to be announced yesterday afternoon at 1:00 p.m. Neither party appeared. Judge Hu and assessors Ye and Cai ascended the bench and announced the main text of the judgment: the appeal was dismissed, and the costs of the second instance were to be borne by the appellant.</p>

<p>Hua Tanmu Liu Junzhi and Bao Tan Li Shugui of the Laozha Detective Office learned that a large gang of bandits was hiding at No. 90, Minti Niyin Road, in the French Concession, plotting illegal activities. They secretly arrested Long Lin (also known as Jun Wu Shaoyuan), Ma Yijin (also known as Desheng), Tang Ming (also known as the Blind Man), Ma Yinhe, Tian Zemin, Weng Xinwu, Chen Chunting, Li Yuncheng, Zhang Chun, Chen Jiesan, He Yinshan, Wan Jiayun, Liu Hanzhen, Qin Tianyou, Xiang Ziyun, Xu Hongyuan, Wang Yunqiao, Su Zhian, Wang Bolin, Yu Minghai, Li Zhongfa, Feng Guoqi, and other twenty-one people, and confiscated a hand grenade, a handgun, and nine bullets, and brought them back to the detective office. It was found that Long Lin had committed multiple kidnapping cases. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The detective office's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the circumstances of the arrest and stated that due to time constraints, they had not had time to investigate and requested a rescheduling of the hearing for investigation. Judge Qian approved it and ordered the case to be rescheduled for one week for further questioning.</p>

<p>Zhao Xilin, a native of Changzhou who was a detective in the Changzhou Public Security Bureau, was dismissed and came to Shanghai to work as an inspector for Shenxin No. 9 Yarn Factory. He lived at No. 24, Ander Road, Yangshupu Road. At about 6:00 p.m. on June 13th last year, he and his concubine, Ms. Jiang, were walking near Wanxingfang on the same road when they were ambushed by an enemy. He was shot in a vital part of his body and killed. The murderer has not yet been apprehended. At noon on the day before yesterday, Hua Tanmu Shen Yuzhou of the Yangshupu Detective Office learned that the accomplice in the case, Tang Bingchang, a 20-year-old native of Changzhou, was hiding in a house at No. 43 on the same road. He coordinated with a Western detective and secretly went to the address to arrest him and brought him to the detective office for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The detective office's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, recounted the previous circumstances and stated that the investigation revealed that the defendant had also committed multiple robbery cases in his hometown. At that time, Zhao Xilin said in the hospital that the defendant was a well-known bandit. He requested a rescheduling for detailed investigation. Shen Tanmu reported the incident. Tang Bingchang confessed that two friends named Shengrong and Quanquan came to his house and asked him to help, giving him two yuan. He initially refused, but they took out a gun and threatened to kill him, so he was afraid and went. He kept watch near the scene. The rest of his confession was evasive. Judge Fu Lin ordered him to be returned for further questioning in seven days to verify the facts.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Lawsuit Following Marital Discord <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Arguments Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Lu Xifan from Suzhou, the former manager of the National Hotel, and Wu Xiufeng, a woman from Guangdong, had a loving relationship for two years. Because she became pregnant, they entered into a marriage contract at the Ting En Law Firm in June this year. On the 25th of last month, Lu held a wedding at the Xindafang Hotel on Edward Road in the French Concession. Because the wedding was not completed, a marital dispute occurred. Wu Xiufeng went to Lu to argue, but was stopped and forced to marry. Because she refused, she was beaten. She filed a complaint with the French Detective Office against Lu and Zhou Qinglin, as well as lawyer Lu Ruizheng, for assault and battery. Lu Xifan also accused Wu's brother-in-law, Xia Yaoting, of gathering a crowd to assault him and cause injury. The Detective Office escorted Lu Xifan and Xia Yaoting to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court to file a public prosecution. The details of the interrogation have been previously reported. The case has now been declared concluded, and the sentencing is scheduled. Wu Xiufeng, because the Detective Office did not file a public prosecution against Qinglin and Lu Ruizheng, hired lawyer Qin Zemin to file a criminal complaint with the Second Court, accusing Zhou and Lu of joint assault and demanding compensation for medical expenses. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., Judge Wu Fanglian of the Criminal Court 5 interrogated both parties, each accompanied by a lawyer. First, the plaintiff Wu Xiufeng stated that after she and Lu Xifan were engaged, she instructed him to notify her parents first and send gifts before arranging a wedding date. Unexpectedly, Lu did not inform her parents or send gifts, but suddenly went to her sister's house on September 25th to marry her at the Xindafang Hotel. Upon hearing the news, she and her sister went to the Xindafang Hotel to argue with Lu Xifan, but she was forced to marry him. She refused to leave and was stopped by Zhou Qinglin. Lu Xifan grabbed her hair and dragged her into the room, punching and kicking her. Lawyer Lu Ruizheng also forced her to marry Lu Xifan and kicked her, causing injury. Zhou Qinglin and Lu Ruizheng both denied the assault and said they were just trying to persuade her and were actually slandered, and verbally filed a counterclaim for damages for defamation. Lawyers for both sides argued for a long time about the name of the first defendant, Lu Xifan, listed on the plaintiff's complaint, since Lu had already been publicly prosecuted by the Detective Office and should not be sued again. The court then ordered the arguments to begin. As a result, the court declared the arguments concluded and scheduled the sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Yingchang Match Factory Fire Due to Carelessness <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Losses Exceed 10,000 Gold</p>
<p>At about 6:05 a.m. yesterday morning, a worker at the Yingchang Match Factory No. 2 warehouse in Lujiadu, Pudong, suddenly noticed wisps of thick smoke coming from the bamboo weaving shed. The worker immediately sounded the alarm. It was during the shift change, and all the factory workers unlocked and pushed open the warehouse door, only to see a fierce fire inside that quickly broke through the roof. The factory's own water pool was opened, and eight or nine taps were used to vigorously extinguish the fire. However, the warehouse was full of already packaged matches, which were extremely flammable and difficult to extinguish for a while. The fire gradually subsided after burning for about an hour, but the pile of matches was so large that thick smoke was still coming out. The extinguishing work will continue throughout the night. In this incident, all six rooms of the No. 2 warehouse were completely destroyed. Three to four hundred boxes of Xiaoan matches and more than one hundred boxes of Beautiful Insurance and other brands were also burned. Most of the remaining matches were soaked in water and rendered useless. The total loss of houses and matches amounted to more than 10,000 gold. As for the cause of the fire, according to the factory director, Mr. Sun Muyi, the warehouse door has always been locked, and no one can enter. Therefore, there should be no cigarette butts falling in. It may be that mice chewed the paste on the paper wrapping and dragged out the matchsticks, and the match heads rubbed against the sandpaper, causing them to ignite. When the fire started, Director Zhang of District 3 and Director Yang of Precinct 1 supervised the police to maintain order at the scene. After the fire was extinguished, the factories resumed work as usual without any impact.</p>

<p>Gold Market Reactionary Decline</p>
<p>Returning to the 740 Taels Mark. Yesterday, gold prices showed signs of renewed sluggishness, retreating back to the 740 tael level. The situation remains stable, with intraday fluctuations limited to just over one tael. The total daily range did not exceed four taels, and compared to last Saturday, there was a decline of 4.9 mace. This is indeed a reaction after six consecutive days of frequent increases. There was no significant buying or selling activity from any party; however, sellers appeared to be more numerous. The initial decline was largely influenced by the near-sharp rise in the silver market, possibly due to a loosening trend in foreign exchange rates. Minor fluctuations are expected moving forward. A strong selling sentiment prevailed in the later market, with exchange rates being particularly soft, further exacerbating the weakness. The final price was only around 739 taels. November delivery deferred to December delivery was traded by Tong Feng Heng to Da De Cheng at a premium of 5.75 mace, amounting to only 7,000 bars. There were no transactions in spot gold by the Central Bank. Market inventory is reportedly at normal levels. The market situation for today and the future is as follows:</p>
<p>Initial Decline: Trading opened at 742.5 taels for December delivery, down 1.7 mace. The private cable from the Bank of America stated that the "large eighth" public cable should not be changed, while the large bar remained unchanged. Subsequently, the price fell from 743 taels to 741.6 mace, with Yuan Mao Yong, Zhao Feng Chang, Yi Feng Yong, and others selling. Heng Xing Bing, Heng Chang Yong, Yuan Tai, Gong Yong, Da De Cheng, and others bought in, and the price recovered to 743 taels, likely because the exchange market remained stable. January English gold was at 194375, available for delivery. Hua Bi absorbed more than half a penny, and Sassoon &amp; Co. made some purchases. Yuan Mao Yong and Heng Xing sold again, causing a decline of one tael. At 9:30 AM, British and American listings were each up 125, the price was 42 taels. Then, it increased by 3 or 4 mace. Suddenly, Heng Xing sold again, with Da De Cheng, Fu Yu He, and Fu Tai Che also selling. January English gold forward trades were at 25. Citibank released November at 125, and the gold price fell another tael. At 10:00 AM, the price was 41.3 taels. Shortly after, Tong Chang, Xie Xing, Yong Da Xing, Yong Yuan Tai, and others bought in. Macgarrie quoted December English gold at 4375. At 10:30 AM, the price was 42.9 taels. The situation remained very stable thereafter, but Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Yu, Fu Chang, Yu He, and others sold more of Heng, causing a decrease of 7 or 8 mace. At 10:45 AM, it was at 2.1 mace. Afterwards, it fluctuated by only 3 or 4 mace. Trading was sluggish, and there was no significant demand for exchange notes. Around 11:00 AM, it was at 42.5 taels, and by noon, it closed at 41.3 taels.</p>
<p>Decline of 4.9 Mace: The afternoon market opened at 42.4 taels, quickly falling by two taels and several mace. This was due to Fu Chang, Heng Yu, Xie Xing, Yong Fu Yu, Tong Chang, and others leaning towards selling. Zheng Jin also sold December English gold at 4375 to Xing Mai Bank. Subsequently, Mai Bank and An Da conducted mutual trades for January at half a penny. An Da then released January American gold at 3125 to 375, dropping to 39.8 taels by 2:50 PM. However, Wu Pin and Bing Xing, among others, bought in, immediately bringing it back up by one tael, to 41.4 taels. After 3:15 PM, Gan Chang Xiang, Fu Chang, Da Xing Yong, Heng Yu, and others showed a strong intention to sell. There were also rumors from foreign telegrams that Britain had issued 3% bonds, causing a shock to sentiment. Furthermore, the US dollar broke through the 40 tael mark, falling to 39.4 taels at 4:00 PM. Retail buyers bought in, and at 4:15 PM, it was at 40.01 taels. Fu Chang Xian sold continuously, finally reaching 39.2 taels. By 4:30 PM, the market closed at 39.3 taels, down 4.9 mace from last weekend (trades were made at 9.56 mace after closing). The highest daily price was 43 taels, the lowest was 39.2 taels, with a difference of 3.8 taels, adding 14.25 taels.</p>
<p>Discounted Prices Mostly Down Two Taels: The listed price for American dollars was high at 125, resulting in 803 taels with a squeeze of 612 taels, then 60 taels. In the afternoon, 61 taels then 64 taels, two taels more than last Saturday. Posted prices for this month were 45 taels, November 44 taels, December 42 taels, compensation water 46 taels, afternoon 43 taels. More Transactions Occurred Over-the-Counter: Over-the-counter transactions showed that Heng Xing, Da Xing Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Yuan Tai, Xie Xing Yong, Wan Xing, Ri Chang, Fu Tai Heng, Zhi Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, Bing Xing, and Wu Pin were all buying, while Shun Li, Yuan Heng, Yuan Mao Yong, Gan Chang Xiang, Hong Kang Yong, Yi Feng Yong, and Yu He were all selling. Fu Chang and Heng Yu each sold over 3000 bars. In the later market, Fu Xing Yong, Bing Xing, Yuan Xing Yong, and Wu Pin were all buying. Da De Cheng was also buying. However, clients such as Heng Yu, Fu Yu, Ri Chang, Heng Chang Yong, Yu He, Yuan Mao Yong, Da Xing Yong, and Gan Chang Xiang were all selling. Fu Chang sold quite a bit, approximately 2,000 bars. Xie Xing Yong also sold over 300 bars. Other firms had varying inflows and outflows, but there were no large transactions. The Dalian group sold a total of over 300 bars, the Huai group over 200, and the Guang group (Heng Xing) approximately 600 bars in total, buying around 200, which was reportedly for client transactions.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Loosening Both Openly and Covertly</p>
<p>Yesterday's Monday Silver Market Telegraph: HSBC's listed prices lengthened by half a notch, with British and American currencies each up by 125. Other currencies also eased, but Hong Kong remained the same, likely because domestic markets also saw easing. There was not much change throughout the day. As a result, British and American currencies were each up by 1875 compared to last Saturday. However, exchange rates were reported to be low the day before, so the US dollar was not excessively loose. However, the gold market showed a reverse trend, retreating back to the 740 tael level. Trading at various banks was normal. British gold still had over 100,000 pounds, Sassoon &amp; Co. made some purchases, and gold firms slightly sold. Various banks and Mai Bank bought in, while Japanese merchants sold, with considerable forward trading. US dollars only amounted to 300,000 to 400,000, the silver company slightly bought in, and various gold firms made minor cover purchases.</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<p>Bonds Re-enter a Stable Path</p>
<p>丨Transaction Volume Approximately 4.1 Million丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was that there were many types of spot trading, but only a small number of transactions. The total for the day was only 19,000 yuan. The futures market was generally still lively. Although large players were still not seen making large purchases or sales, scattered inflows and outflows were still active. The transaction volume was over 2.1 million in the morning and over 1.9 million in the afternoon, totaling 4.08 million yuan. Salt tax bonds accounted for 900,000 yuan, consolidated tax bonds for over 700,000 yuan, and disarmament and reorganization bonds averaged about 500,000 yuan each. 1920 Customs bonds and 2020 Customs bonds each accounted for over 300,000 yuan. Other bonds were relatively quiet. As for the trend of various bond prices, their stability remained unchanged. This is because there were no new developments in the bond market environment, and market sentiment was as calm as before. Most of the buying and selling transactions were swaps, and the supply and demand situation was very balanced. The daily price fluctuations were mostly only 2 or 3 jiao, generally trending upward compared to before. For example, the disarmament and reorganization futures for the October term were up by about half a yuan. Other bonds only fluctuated by a few jiao. Also, today is the last day of trading for the current month's futures.</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Trading Sluggish</p>
<p>A report from Xin Feng Foreign Firm: Last Saturday (the 22nd), the New York stock market, due to good freight reports, the trend was slightly firm. During the week of October 8th to 15th, the number of freight cars totaled 650,578, an increase of 24,942 compared to the previous week. However, trading was unusually sluggish, with only 400,000 shares traded in half a day by professional speculators. Looking at the overall stock market situation, it is difficult to predict, and it is also difficult to determine the impact of the election results. Last week, the Democratic presidential candidate announced that he would only support the veterans' pension plan after the budget was made up. Short sellers rushed to cover their positions, but there was a lack of sellers, and the market did not rebound, indicating the public's cautious attitude. In the coming weeks, the stock market is likely to remain without significant developments amid political uncertainty. Only first-class bonds can still be purchased. The Dow Jones index for the 22nd is listed below: Closing Price Change from Previous Day 30 Industrial Stocks 60.85 Down 0.16 20 Railway Stocks 27.26 Down 0.02 20 Public Utility Stocks 26.94 Down 0.07 40 Bonds 79.65 Down 0.12</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>

As a result, the near month fell 2.1 to 1.6 taels, the edge fell 1 tael.

<p>Cotton Falls Severely This Month by 9 Qian</p>
<p>The cotton market fell severely this month by 9 qian, approaching the 30 tael mark. It is said that a certain manufacturer has purchased a large amount of current cotton at a discounted price for delivery, totaling about 50,000 to 60,000 dan. On the receiving side, there are only about 30,000 to 40,000 dan. As a result, the general __________, discovering panic, caused the market to shake, but the Yong An factory, the majority long, has not taken action. Current cotton trading in the market is very quiet.</p>
<p>Affected by Current Deliveries: The market sentiment changed greatly this month at Zheng __________ before the auction opened.

<p>Indian and British Cotton Industry Weekly News</p>
<p>Bombay: Last week's market price did not follow the US fall. There was a lack of sellers in the market and Far East exporters purchased blank spaces. Moreover, local ________ had an excess supply trend. Although Japanese purchases were a good opportunity to close out speculative longs, the actual situation was still good. The harvest was satisfactory. The Omra cotton area generally received rain. In terms of the spot market, it was quiet at the beginning of the week. Afterwards, there was good export demand and local manufacturers also purchased. The attached statistics for last week are as follows (units in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>| | 1931 | 1932 |</p>

<p>Liverpool: Last week's spot demand was not good. Futures were entirely controlled by the political situation, with not much change. Industry peers purchased. The sharp drop in silver prices during the week triggered speculative purchases, stabilizing the market price. Although Egyptian cotton had the support of the mainland group and industry peers, it still followed the US cotton's movements.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Rice Market Situation Tightening</p>
<p>Hu Nan: Yesterday, only five or six ships arrived. There were few ships stored in the Pu River, and the local street trading was lively. Qing Jiao ________ and Changxi group all raised by 3 jiao, and Yang Du Jian also increased by a jiao or so. No ships from Suzhou, Wujiang, Tongli, or Lili arrived in Shanghai, so this street lacked goods to meet demand.</p>
<p>Xin Zha: Yesterday, there were still many sources, and urban and rural trading was normal. Northern glutinous rice ________ species and rural stomachs moved slightly, and prices rose by a jiao or so. Chen Po Xing Fu and Lu Fa arrived and sales were even, with no price increases or decreases. Changing shade yuan goods were scarce, and prices rose by 5 fen.</p>
<p>Imported Rice Rises Sharply by 2 Jiao 丨丨Southern Gang's Sales Turn Prosperous丨丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market was very lively. Although the northern group temporarily took a wait-and-see approach without any action due to price limits, the Fuzhou group followed up with a strong appetite. Yesterday, they first processed 1,700 bags of small twisted rice, and _________ still _________ processed. However, there were not many imported rice flowing in the market, and there were even fewer re-exports among the flowing goods. Therefore, cargo owners raised prices and refused to sell easily. As a result, only 1,700 bags of small twisted rice were sold. Now that the cargo owners of Ming goods can _________ move, there will definitely be a large number of transactions again. The price immediately jumped up by 2 jiao. No. 1 Saigon was taken away by this street at 300 bags, the goods were relatively inferior, and the price also followed closely, nearly a jiao. The Northern gang originally had an appetite, but because of the unsuccessful price negotiations, they only tried to process 600 bags of Jiangxi machine yuan rice. Because cargo owners _________ accommodated customers, the price saw a small decrease. The selling price of small twisted rice was 8 yuan 05 fen to 7 yuan 9 jiao, totaling 2,000 bags, No. 1 Saigon was 9 yuan 1 jiao 3 fen, and Jiangxi _________ yuan was 10 yuan 06 jiao and a half to 10 yuan 04 jiao and 8 fen.</p>
<p>Flour Prices Plummeting Continuously</p>
<p>After the morning market opened yesterday, each month in the flour market showed a uniform downward trend. Although the price of imported wheat was only a small jiao or so, the excess of agricultural products and the catastrophic decline of prices abroad had already affected China. For example, Australian wheat was cheap at 2 taels 6 qian per customs unit, and Japanese _________ Jin Yang flour was only 1 tael 7 qian per _________. These reports were enough to cause fear in the market. Therefore, the market was still stable when the opening price was announced. Afterwards, it gradually plummeted. Although manufacturers did not wildly sell off most of their _________, they _________ the distant _________, and those who were unable to _________ had to cut their losses painfully, causing the market to collapse. Both near and far terms fell more than 2 fen, and when the afternoon market opened, sentiment was extremely soft again. January fell to 1 tael 7 qian and a half, which was in line with the prediction from the week before. The market improved slightly due to floating shorts covering their positions, recovering nearly a fen from the lowest point. However, Fu Feng still sold off, and the situation abroad still showed signs of excess. The subsequent steps are likely to be short-lived and long-term useless. As a result, this month fell 2 fen and a half compared to the previous week, November fell 2 fen and 2 li and a half, December fell 1 fen and a half, January fell 2 fen, February fell 1 fen and 7 li and a half, and March fell 1 fen and a half.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Plunge 7 Fen</p>

<h3 id="e84">Judge Feetham's Report on the Shanghai International Settlement, Volume IV (2) <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>B. The Position of Committees within the International Settlement</p>
<p>1.  According to the existing situation, the main benefit that the Board of Directors derives from the use of the committee system is the benefit listed under heading III above, namely, the preliminary consideration of various important issues by the committees and the submission to the Board of Directors of the conclusions and recommendations on those issues contained in their minutes. The benefit under heading I is the result of the division of labor, and the extent to which this benefit is enjoyed is very limited because the committees have no executive power. The benefit described under heading II, which comes from the committees having the power to represent the final decision of the Board of Directors, cannot be said to have been enjoyed for the same reason. With regard to the benefit under heading III, which comes from the committees serving the Board of Directors in a purely advisory capacity, I believe that a more specific provision should be made as described above (Note 7) to ensure that the Board of Directors always has a committee report before submitting any important matter for resolution. This is the power of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>2.  One characteristic of the committee system developed in the International Settlement is that it includes members temporarily appointed by the Board of Directors. These members are not directors of the Board of Directors, but are either representatives of a particular section of society or have special knowledge or experience of the matters discussed by the committees. The inclusion of temporary members in the committee is an expedient strategy adopted to overcome some of the difficulties caused by the fact that the number of directors is subject to the restrictions of the Land Regulations. As a result, the Board of Directors can draw on outside talent and allow the majority of social leaders to participate in part of the work of the committee, so that the Board of Directors can more fully represent an entire society in the performance of its administrative duties.</p>
<p>3.  However, the Land Regulations stipulate that "the Board of Directors may elect officers from among the directors to organize committees" (Article 23). Therefore, the method of joining committees as non-directors has not been authorized by the Land Regulations. Part of the legal defects in the committee organization law has been pointed out. "Therefore, each committee is only an advisory body and does not have the power to execute within the scope of recognition" (Note 8). The result of not granting executive power to the committees is that most committees are only convened when particularly important matters are deemed necessary to be brought to the attention of the committees, rather than holding meetings on a regular basis at short intervals.</p>
<p>4.  In addition, there is another reason for the trend to reduce the number of committee meetings in the past, that is, when problems arise from time to time, the matter is discussed with the members by circulating documents instead of convening a committee. This method was very common in the past. The method used is to send a memorandum stating the issue to be decided, together with all the letters and reports related to the issue in the archives, to each member for circulation, and to ask each member to write down his opinion on the memorandum. If the result of the consultation is that the members agree, the issue is considered to have been decided. However, if the members disagree, the issue is reserved for consideration at a future committee meeting. The Board of Directors and the committees of the Public Works Department have limited use of this method, but at one time it was used frequently, so that the directors and members spent a lot of time paying attention to the circulated notes and the attached documents, which was very tiring. This is because the directors and members could not read the documents at their convenience, but had to put aside other matters that were being handled and immediately pay attention to the documents circulated by the Public Works Department, and then they could decide on their opinions and write them on the documents and immediately forward the documents to the second member, who also had to study the documents in the same way and write down his opinions.</p>
<p>5.  Although the method of consulting by circulating documents is still in use to some extent, as far as I know, in part because of the disposition of matters by the Director-General, the number of documents circulated has been greatly reduced in recent times. The English name of the Director-General was formerly DirectorGeneral, but is now SecretaryGeneral. Some of the issues that used to be discussed with the Board of Directors or committees have now been authorized to the Director-General to have a wider scope to consider and handle.</p>
<p>6.  The foreseeable result of depriving committees of any executive power is that a large amount of trivial work is left entirely to the directors themselves. However, as far as I can tell, this is not actually the case, except perhaps when the method of circulating documents is used extensively.</p>
<p>7.  As far as I have observed, the agenda of the Board of Directors' regular meetings is not filled with a large number of trivial matters. If we consider the administrative scope of the Public Works Department, the number of special issues that are actually handled and decided by the Board of Directors at its weekly regular meetings is relatively small.</p>
<p>8.  I believe that the reason why this is so is that, in fact, although the committees have no executive power, the main officials of the Public Works Department, generally speaking, the heads of the various departments, and specifically, the Director-General and the Director of Finance, are allowed to exercise and have exercised extensive executive power to carry out the actual work of administration. For most issues that are considered routine, they can be handled on their own authority without having to specifically submit the issues to the Board of Directors and committees for consideration.</p>
<p>9.  The recently revised Board of Directors Rules and Regulations and the Regulations on the Duties of the Main Officials of the Public Works Department (Note 9) both reflect the situation described above. The duties of the committees are described as being only advisory, and even in terms of the advisory position of the committees, there is no provision specifying which issues should be submitted to the committees for consideration, except in very few cases, in order to protect the advisory position of the committees. The regulations explicitly grant executive power to the heads of the various departments for a limited number of issues. In addition, there are several provisions from which it can be inferred that this power can usually be used by the heads of the various departments in the course of ordinary administrative work. As for how the use is restricted, there is no clear provision. It is stated that routine issues can be handled by the relevant officials, and policy issues should be referred to the Board of Directors. However, it seems that the determination of what is a routine issue and what is a policy issue is largely left to the relevant officials. A detailed study of the revised Board of Directors Rules and Regulations, with regard to the status of the various committees and the extent of the administrative power that can be exercised by the heads of the various departments, is contained in the appendix to this chapter (Note 10). A comparison of the old rules and regulations, as well as certain proposed reforms that have been considered, are also mentioned in that appendix. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e85">The So-Called Diplomatic Skills <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>Old Man Xiang is as usual, sitting in his chair reading a book. This is a good habit of not letting the day pass idly! I knocked on the door and went in to report some things. After finishing, Old Man Xiang said, take a look at this "Yan Family Instructions"!</p>
<p>I responded and took it to read. It turned out to be about: During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, parents taught their children to speak Xianbei and play the Huqin, preparing to serve the foreign princes and officials who had taken over China! After reading it, I remained silent.</p>
<p>Old Man Xiang then sighed, "Now Chinese children also learn foreign languages and play mahjong!" I felt a little uneasy listening to this! Old Man Xiang then told me that the customs of Western diplomats were even more unbearable, giving many examples. Here is an interesting story:</p>
<p>"Paris wine, drunk in London, has to be cheap and good. Think about the behind-the-scenes dealings! Many scholars, when they reach a dead end, go to rely on diplomats. The ambassador or minister still has to examine his character, whether he really has some knowledge. As a result, if there is no good position, he is assigned to be a doorman. Think about it, isn't that humiliating? Not at all!</p>
<p>Because all the items shipped to the embassies or legations abroad are routinely tax-exempt, London can drink cheap and good Paris wine! When the embassy can't finish drinking, the doorman and other staff can sell some to the local gentry! The poor scholar acting as a doorman can originally make connections with visiting gentlemen through his conversation, so the problem of livelihood is solved!</p>
<p>This is just using so-called diplomatic skills to do something interesting."</p>
<h3 id="e86">Hoe Life <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Rongyu</p>
<p>丨 Put down the gun and pick up the hoe 丨</p>
<p>"Labor can improve health." "Mental labor is not as pleasant as physical labor." These two sentences are indeed correct! I, who am used to holding a pen, have recently put down the pen and picked up a hoe. But I hold this hoe not really to learn to be a gardener, but for two reasons:</p>
<p>First: "It is good to be vigorous when old" is a saying that everyone knows and hopes for. I am approaching middle age, and relying on the pen for a living, I rarely exercise my body or have the opportunity to move my muscles and bones. If you squeeze into a group of young people and practice some sports, others will definitely say you are crazy. Taking this opportunity to hoe the fields, I can exercise my body and strengthen my muscles and bones.</p>
<p>Second: "Go to the countryside" is a saying that everyone shouts. But the extravagance and comfort of city life make you unwilling to leave. Now I have come to the countryside. If I don't hold a hoe, I am not a real country person.</p>
<p>I know that these two reasons are not very thorough. However, I, who hold a pen, although I do not benefit the country, I do not harm society. Now I have put down the pen. If the soldiers who hold guns are willing to put down their guns and pick up hoes, that would be a great joy!</p>
<p>Speaking of holding a hoe, it was a bit painful at first. In the first few days, blisters appeared on my hands; after a few days, my limbs ached. When calluses grew on my hands and my limbs recovered and felt comfortable, holding a hoe and wielding it freely was much easier than holding a pen!</p>
<p>The harvest under the hoe is nothing more than melons, beans, and vegetables. The crystallization of labor is naturally fresher and more precious than those sold in the market. After sweating a lot, large melons, clusters of beans, and sweet and tender vegetables give you a considerable reward, which is also worth it.</p>
<p>The comrades in the countryside who hold hoes are muddle-headed and still have ancient customs, and they are much happier than the comrades who hold pens and guns. They get up in the morning, go to a small teahouse to drink a pot of tea, talk about mountains and seas; in the evening, after finishing work, go to a small tavern to drink a few cups of white wine, and go home to sleep, which is very much in line with the saying "work at sunrise, rest at sunset."</p>
<p>Dear readers! I am not promoting rural life just because I have come to the countryside, and desperately writing beautiful articles about the countryside. In fact, the scenery of the countryside is so interesting, and our country has always been "established on agriculture," so it is worth promoting!</p>

<p>— Recorded by Di Pingzi</p>
<p>Bearing the inner Dharma, all the great lay Buddhists who initiated the Kalachakra Vajra Dharma assembly are aware of the previous letter, which has now been delivered. Now, I will briefly contribute my humble opinion. Because of the continuous wars and disasters in various places, all sentient beings are suffering immeasurable pain. Tracing the cause, it is due to ignorance of the truth of good and evil. Now, if we want to thoroughly investigate its principles so that everyone knows the importance of taking and abandoning, this is the business of those who study inner learning. I respectfully submit that my teacher, Shakyamuni Tathagata, is also an incarnation. From his time as an ordinary person, he has regarded all sentient beings as far superior to himself, cherishing and protecting them. For the sake of others, he did not hesitate to give up his most precious life. Moreover, he was meticulous in his actions, never doing anything evil, no matter how small. If anyone harmed him, even if it was unbearable, he would persevere in forbearance, cultivate all good deeds, be diligent without end, eliminate distractions, keep his mind constantly in concentration, reach the fundamental truth of the Dharma, and wisdom would appear.</p>
<p>Practice, such as the six perfections practiced in turn, to the end, cutting off all afflictions and the two obscurations of knowledge, manifesting the power of the four bodies, clearly knowing all knowable objects without a hair's breadth of concealment, purifying all diseases, possessing all merits, still without even a trace of suffering, even the name of suffering has been extinguished. Therefore, he constantly dwells in the bliss of the Dharma. However, he is not satisfied with the vows of his past intentions, vowing to lead all sentient beings into his own samadhi of bliss, speaking of all kinds of suffering. With such a mind, he constantly and diligently benefits sentient beings, responding to all the opportunities and inclinations of sentient beings, and speaking of the common and uncommon Dharma. Moreover, all the Dharma he speaks is not based on what others say, but according to his own enlightened realm, speaking truthfully. Therefore, all of us sentient beings should follow the Buddha's teachings and practice as instructed.</p>
<p>The most important thing in learning Buddhism is to have great faith in the teacher, Buddha. If you want to have faith in the Buddha, you should first study the deeds of the Buddha's incarnations. If you gain something from studying them, faith will naturally arise. Then, the idea of treasuring and protecting the rare and precious Dharma will also arise. Once this mind is established, you will naturally be able to cultivate all good deeds diligently and tirelessly, and it will also increase constantly. Let's get rid of the bad habits.</p>
<p>The essence of the Dharma lies in the mind. Reaching the essence of the Dharma lies in recognizing your own mind and saving your own nature. I and all sentient beings, because we know self-sacrifice, generate greed for all fame and fortune, praise, and relatives and friends. On the contrary, if others harm my virtue, wealth, or treasures, or prevent them from increasing, I will not tolerate it and will generate regret. Therefore, I do not tend towards all good deeds, and I do not know all evil deeds. This is because I am deluded by ignorance, the three poisons increase daily, and the delusions of pride, jealousy, and wrong views also grow with them. This is the total cause of the accumulation of all sufferings.</p>
<p>If you know your own mind and save yourself, all afflictions will naturally cease. Once afflictions cease, bliss will naturally arise. This is the natural principle.</p>

"Manchukuo!" "What's the matter?" "He is a slave of a defeated country (referring to the Korean), and I am also a slave of a defeated country (!). Why doesn't he pay me back the money he owes me!"</p>
<p>The Japanese police officer laughed loudly, took out two yuan from his side, "Take it!" The Chinese gambler respectfully accepted it and said repeatedly, "Yes! Yes!"

<p>When Tong Yizhen spoke of the most sad place, he couldn't help but want to cry loudly. Lu Boqin stood like a stone statue, unexpectedly giving a decisive answer: "This, don't be sad, I can answer you immediately. I have made up my mind, let's go into the pass together." At this</p>

If you rashly follow me, it will be of no benefit to you, and it will be too damaging to your reputation. I thought that the previous difficulties still had hope of being saved, so there was no need to rush to take this last resort. Even this time I have to leave you to return to the mainland, although I am very reluctant; but in the end I still thought that if you stayed here alone, it shouldn't be absolutely dangerous, and maybe I can still leave quietly in the end; but today's matter is greatly different! These people who want to harm you are like wild beasts that cannot be reasoned with, and what is in front of you is the most serious moment between humans and beasts. How can I hesitate for another moment, watching you fall into the group of wild beasts? Therefore, I have no choice but to make this decision from the perspective of power, without regard to all common interests." Lu Boqin explained his theory very resolutely. "But how should we go?" Tong Yizhen still had to ask clearly. "Fortunately, things are also very coincidental; today I also received news from the bureau that the Postmaster has received an order from the government to close the post office and lead all the staff into the pass. Japan has also agreed to sign passports, and we can take their Fengshan Railway train. As long as we have the date of boarding, we can secretly board the train together." Lu Boqin also had a more practical way. Finally, Tong Yizhen remembered all the obstacles to his departure and proposed to discuss how to deal with them with Lu Boqin in detail? A secret plan was also set.</p>

<h3 id="e91">On Nominalist Philosophy <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>Speaking of philosophy, it evokes a long string of terms from various schools: "Monism," "Dualism," "Pluralism," "Materialism," "Idealism," "Sentimentalism," etc., but oddly enough, the term "Nominalist Philosophy" is never heard. This is the fault of past historians. In reality, this doctrine has been passed down for a very long time and is highly revered. People who uphold this doctrine are truly everywhere. Now, I will briefly outline its main points for future compilers of philosophical histories to refer to.</p>
<p>Speaking of the origins of this doctrine, because it has been passed down for so long, written records have been lost. Some say it originated in A. Others say it originated with Xun Kuang, Gongsun Long, and their followers. Some say it was established by Confucius, because he wrote the "Spring and Autumn Annals," which terrified rebellious ministers and villainous sons, and he also said, "What is necessary is to rectify names." This seems relatively close. However, Mencius said that the account in the Book of Documents of King Wu's conquest of Zhou, where blood flowed so much that pestles floated, is unreliable. So, great... It seems that during the Three Dynasties, there was something like a news policy, like today's information warfare, which can serve as evidence for the existence of this doctrine. In short, it can be asserted that it existed in ancient times and is even more prevalent today. As for the traces of its transmission, they are quite vague, and I will leave it to gentlemen with a penchant for textual research and history to investigate. Here, I can only omit it.</p>
<p>Secondly, speaking of the benefits of this doctrine, the first is that it can deal with others, and the second is that it can comfort oneself. For example, if Wang Xiao'er is angered by Li A'si, he holds a grudge in his heart. He then draws a turtle on the wall and writes next to it, "Li A'si is a little turtle." He looks at it himself, and Li A'si has really turned into a little turtle. Thus, his anger subsides, his hatred disappears, and this small dispute comes to an end. If Wang Xiao'er were to be replaced by someone who could write, he would pick up a pen and write an article insinuating and slandering, and publish it externally, or write an anonymous letter to threaten him. As long as the other party is slightly affected, his wishes will be fulfilled. There is no need for it to actually happen, nor is it necessary to realize what you said with real swords and guns – that would be too much trouble. If you want to save the country, then you might as well first set a program, and then issue a declaration, saying how the country should be saved. Outsiders will admire it, and you yourself won't think it's anything special when you read it. At this time, if you feel that your anger has not subsided, then you can shout a slogan at will, such as "Down with ××," "Kill all ××," "Long-term resistance," "Swear to resist Japan," and the like. The more fierce the words, the more tragic the tone, the better. You don't have to shout it on the street; it's also okay in a mansion or villa. Speaking of the function of relieving anger, shouting slogans and singing actually have the same effect. Therefore, speaking of the application of this doctrine, it is truly boundless. For example, if you have a child at home who cries at night and cannot sleep, then you can write a line on red paper, "The Heavenly Emperor is bright, the Earthly Emperor is bright..." and paste it on the street. Or, if you have a severe cold, you can also write a line in the same way, "Selling a severe cold, success at first sight," and paste it in the toilet or on a telephone pole. Although your child may not necessarily fall asleep, and your cold may not necessarily get better, at least you yourself are comforted. If you are a merchant, then please do not be stingy with those extremely self-sacrificing words, such as "Regardless of cost," "Selling at cost," and the like. You also don't have to worry that you don't sound like a merchant; no one will question you. You should also be good at using terms such as "Bargain," "Discount," and so on. From the grand opening bargain to the clearance sale, in the newspapers and verbally, just keep saying "Great Bargain, Special Bargain." Once, twice, ten weeks, five weeks, it will definitely not conflict with your original profit-making purpose. This is the function of names. Or, if someone criticizes you for going to the movies every day, you can say, "Entertaining doesn't mean forgetting the national crisis." If you don't have a son and want to take a concubine, you can say, "Of the three unfilial acts, having no descendants is the greatest." Alas, the use of names is great indeed.</p>

<p>— Enthusiastic</p>
<p>We know that a bowl of water can be divided into two bowls. We naturally believe that a drop of water, when divided to the point where it cannot be divided further, can no longer be divided in the name of water. But we can still use scientific methods to divide this drop of water into two kinds of atoms. Can atoms not be divided further? No. Every atom has a nucleus and many electrons. Of course, it is possible to divide the atom further into a nucleus and individual electrons. Now, if we take everything in this world and analyze it step by step, the final result is that everything comes down to the nucleus of the atom and electrons. They are currently considered the original substances that make up this world.</p>
<p>If we use electricity to explain, then in every atom, its nucleus always carries a positive charge; the electron always carries a negative charge. These electrons, which create everything in the world</p>
<p>The shape and characteristics of the substances are the same. That is to say, the electrons in a gold atom and the electrons in a silver atom are not different. However, the number of electrons contained in two different atoms is very different. The reason why the same electrons constitute different atoms lies in this.</p>
<p>So, why are the numbers of electrons different in different atoms? This is because the amount of positive charge carried by the nucleus of the atom is different. For example, if the nucleus of atom A carries more positive charge than the nucleus of atom B, it needs more electrons because it needs to equalize the amount of positive charge it carries, so it naturally needs more than atom B. If an atom loses some of its inherent electrons due to external pressure, then the positive charge emitted by the nucleus inside it becomes excessive. This excess of positive charge</p>
<p>Then, he tried his best to attract electrons from other places to maintain his original equilibrium. In our spare time, we occasionally play a trick: we take a piece of silk to wipe a piece of glass, and when the glass gets hot, we use it to attract paper scraps. This is the reason. The glass loses some of its electrons as a result of friction. There are electrons inside the paper scraps. It's just that the paper scraps can't let go and let the electrons be sucked away by the glass. So, it's like you pulling and me tugging, and the result is that the lighter one suffers. The paper scraps are sucked away by the glass.</p>

<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>Based on what was said above, let's imagine that we are now using a scientific method to confine many nuclei of electrons carrying positive charges on one side. They all need a large number of electrons to combine with them, and confine many electrons carrying negative charges on the other side. They are all waiting for something to lead them so that they have a place to return. When we put these two sides together, every electron rushes to the nucleus, and every nucleus absorbs electrons with all its might. A violent change is inevitable. This violent change will not stop until all the electrons on the electron side are gone. The batteries we usually use have this function when they are energized. However, the explanation of electricity was already available before the invention of electrons. Scientists used water as an analogy, believing that current flows from the anode to the cathode, just like water flows from high ground to low ground. Of course, this explanation has no other basis than association. However, scientists have been using this explanation for a long time, and many theorems are based on this explanation, so there is no way to abolish it. Therefore, there is a very ridiculous contradictory fact in electrical science now: the current flows from the anode to the cathode, and the electrons flow from the cathode to the anode. But although this fact is ridiculous, we must always keep it in mind when we study it.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Questions on New Families and Social Improvement <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Question by Gao Zhuoyun</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Wang Mingxing's article "My Opinion on the Standards of New Families" in the Shanghai Shen Bao supplement, I have some doubts and would like to express my humble opinion for readers to discuss. Mr. Wang said, "The evils of Chinese society are said to be myriad: the important reason, in my humble opinion, lies not in the family but in the government's inability to enable people to live and work in peace and solve the problem of people's livelihood." It is certainly true that the evils of Chinese society lie in the government's inability to enable people to live and work in peace! But it is not true that it does not lie in the family. After all, the organization of society and the people are of primary importance. The depth of the people's knowledge, the strength of their physical fitness, and the goodness or badness of their habits are all self-evident in their importance to the country. If we want to advance the people's knowledge, strengthen their physical fitness, and improve their habits, then we must improve education, promote physical education, and reform entertainment! Which one can be lacking? Therefore, if we want to cultivate good citizens, we must have a good environment. After a child is born, the family is its first environment. Whether the family is good or bad has a great impact on the child's future! Children are the pillars of future society, and whether children are good or bad is also the same as whether society is good or bad. Mr. Wang said that the unimprovement of society does not lie in the family, what is the truth? People who are raised in a bad environment cannot only not cooperate to improve society, but also hinder those who seek improvement. The difficult birth of our country's revolution is not because of the obstruction of generally outdated thinkers. Sun Yat-sen called for psychological construction at the beginning of the revolution for a reason. Rousseau said, "A child who is wrongly taught is further away from wisdom than a child who has not been educated." It can be seen that it is especially important to be cautious in educating children in the first step, and the family is the place where children receive preliminary education, so it cannot be said that the proposal to renovate the family is not an essential suggestion. Although the current political situation is not on the right track, it is truly what we feel pain and heartache about. However, to abandon all progress because the political situation is not on the right track is no different from giving up eating because of choking! As the saying goes, "Keep the big picture in mind and start with the small things." Sun Yat-sen also said, "We must aspire to do great things, not to be great officials." He earnestly warned us to fulfill our responsibilities as citizens and work hard. Since we are powerless and powerless common people, we have no right to interfere with the major plans of the government, so we should also seek improvement in what we can and are able to do. After all, everyone has a family, and everyone can improve the family. Therefore, I intend that the political clarity of the country should begin with the improvement of the family, just as autonomy begins with the local area. In short, it is faster for the government to seek the big and difficult things and for the people to seek the small and easy things, with everyone working together, than to entrust the entire responsibility to the government to seek social progress.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Scattered Notes by the Pillow <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>Generally speaking, in student days, everyone hopes that teachers will take leave and reduce classes. After leaving school and entering the door of society, everyone regrets that they should not have, but it is too late to regret.</p>
<p>It seems that the Russian blind poet Eroshanko said, "The Chinese have rickshaws pulled by people (Note: This was invented by the Japanese, so it is also called a 'Eastern car'), which is really a rare thing!" I think if his eyes were not blind, he would see the scene of the rickshaw pullers sweating in the hot summer, washing their faces, and the passengers sitting comfortably, and I wonder what he would think?</p>
<p>I often hear people saying that two out of every three sentences end with "so-so". On the surface, it is purely a habit that comes out of the mouth involuntarily, and it cannot be said to be anything conscious. But upon careful consideration, this is simply a manifestation of a Chinese inferiority. Everything is "so-so", which has led to the symbol of slow progress and badness in personnel and society. When I first learned English, the teacher seemed to say, "The purpose of reading foreign texts is to understand foreign countries and learn their strengths." But now, college students use it as the most fashionable social skill. When Chinese people meet Chinese people, they also speak foreign languages ​​in a boastful manner, as if they cannot show that they are upper-class people without it. It's really inexplicable!</p>
<p>I usually knew that Chinese planes were only suitable for delivering mail and transporting important people. During the Shanghai war, they didn't even dare to do this and stopped for several days. Thinking of this, I couldn't help but shudder.</p>
<p>The only hope of merchants is that business is good. To put it bluntly, they want to make more money. Therefore, clothing store owners are afraid that people's old clothes will not be removed, and hotel owners are afraid that drinkers will not get drunk. By analogy, drugstore owners are afraid that people will not get sick, and coffin shop owners are afraid that not enough people will die. This is probably the reason why merchants are at the tail end of the four classes of people.</p>
<p>After going to Nanjing, I realized that this so-called historical city, the revolutionary capital, was originally nothing more than that. The unemployed people blocked the roads, and the most developed businesses were hotels, bathhouses, and barbershops. The muddy streets were so narrow that two people would bump shoulders when walking side by side. In disappointment, I was reminded of the collapsing entire Chinese society. The decline of one city is only a small thing.</p>
<p>No matter what students do at school, it is always difficult to mobilize the whole group to participate quickly. Only when it comes to meals can I guarantee that no one will be absent unless there are special circumstances. If there are outstanding female students dancing at the variety show, which is a feast for the eyes, then they will be even more quick to arrive. It turns out that Confucius said, "Food and sex are human nature." People who have a position in society often deliberately dress old, while people who are new to society love to dress gorgeously. All of this is caused by the gaze of social people and an improper pathology.</p>
<p>Many friends say that they wish to be reborn as women in the next life because women in today's society are particularly cheap. In any aspect, they can be irresponsible as long as they have one condition: being beautiful and coquettish. From this, we can know the so-called status of women in today's society.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Flower Club Poison <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Ru Li</p>
<p>"Playing the flower club, nine copper coins pay one yuan, when luck is good, one dollar can get more than thirty yuan, what a great thing this is!" A few men in short shirts were talking with relish at the tea table of the tiger stove. At this time, a small worker, A'si, sat next to him and listened in a daze, thinking that this matter could make it so that I, as a small worker, am busy all day long but only earn a few cents, how can there be a day to get rich? Immediately stood up and ran to a broken and low thatched house in an alley to play the flower club. When he returned home, he was so happy that he kept laughing and said to his wife, "We are going to get rich soon, we can get more than thirty yuan today!"</p>
<p>When the flower club opened in the evening, A'si hurried to check the numbers. He knew that he had not won. A'si was stunned. The person who opened the flower club said to him, "It's nothing strange if you don't win once. If you play a few times in a row, you will win." A'si listened and his heart blossomed with joy and a smile on his face. He took out a dollar from the pocket of his tattered and dirty clothes and bet on one number. From then on, he gave up his original career as a small worker. Every day when he ate and slept, he silently recited in his head whether it was better to bet on "Pearl" or "Must Get". Sometimes he sighed in his dreams, "I got it, I got rich!" A'si played a total of dozens of times, and every time he lost. A few days ago, he suddenly went crazy and shouted loudly, "I can't always win like this, how good is the flower club? I've run out of money at home, and my clothes have been pawned. I heard that it is very accurate to have people's heads to entrust dreams." But where can he get people's heads? So he went even more crazy. He didn't know everything. He ran to the kitchen, took a kitchen knife, and was really going to kill someone. Now he has been caught by the police and taken to the police station. His wife has become a beggar.</p>
<p>Alas, everyone, the above is indeed a true story, not something I made up. Now I want to solemnly say a few words to my dear compatriots: you must know that there are more than thirty numbers in the flower club, and only one number is opened. There are also behind-the-scenes manipulations in it. Where can you get it? Taking the money of blood and sweat to play the flower club is like committing suicide with a sword. All those who are poisoned by the flower club will eventually be separated from their wives and children, and even commit suicide. Is it pitiful or not? Wake up, don't dream of gold, do my proper business, and live my happy life.</p>
