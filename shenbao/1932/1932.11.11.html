<h3 id="c1">農村問題之嚴重誠 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>我國當前最嚴重之問題。莫過於農村問題當前最迫切之工作。亦莫過认救濟農村。</p>
<p>我國爲以農立國。就人口之比例言。農民人數佔全國百分之八十以上。就對外貿易言。農產品之輸出額亦佔我國總輸出額。百分之九十左右。就全國之經濟言。農產經濟。直至目前。猶不失爲我國經濟之主要成分。故農業實爲我國家之基礎。亦即爲我國家之使脈。邇年以來。我國家財政。巳瀕於山窮水。盡社會經濟。亦破壤不堪。而尙克於風雨飄颻之危局中掙扎支持者。則亦以農村尙可剜肉醫瘡之故。</p>
<p>自西歐產業先進國之資本勢力。侵入我國而後。我農村經濟。即淪陷於腐朽沒落之過程。而成爲外國工業經濟之附庸。國内政治。長期紊亂。内戰連綿。匪盜蠭起。災禍洊至。苛捐雜稅。敲骨吸髓。於是而農村乃更無甦息之機。尤其自去年全國大水而後農村更顯呈珍部崩潰之勢。今歲雖歲慶大有。農產豐收。然而荒旣爲災。豐亦無以救農村之凋敝。瞻農民之死亡。且適使恐慌之程度更臻於深重。農民更多流離。綏遠之五原。紅糧二百六十斤。僅値七角。穀子亦僅値七角餘即如江浙各地。穀價亦低至兩元餘。農民種田一畝。且經蝕本數元。夫農產豐收。農民反無食。而豐收之實質。則又不同於美國或日本之過剩。其所顯示之意義。一言蔽之。即爲農村崩潰之加速農業恐慌之深化。　　往歲我國農產輸出品。絲與茶實爲大宗。邇歲以來。絲茶皆一落千丈。民十八絲繭著名產區之浙江。產繭約爲一百一十萬擔。民十九即减收五分之一。民二十復減收五分之一。至於今年。更形驟减。而銷路停滯。有貨無市。價格慘落不敷成本。種桑養蠶之家。更多火繭掘桑。仰天痛哭。絲業前途。殆已無復振興之望。致於茶業。在十八世紀。華茶固曾壟斷世界市塲。但近數十年來。市塲旣爲人所攫奪。產額亦江河日下。十八世紀之黃金時代。殆亦徒殘存於吾人之迴憶中而永永無法挽回。茶絲之情勢旣如斯。而日常生活所必需之糧食。則復由國外如潮湧進。夫以農立國之國家。而衣食住行之日常生活必需品。皆仰給於人。吾人即不言社會經濟破落之堪虞。而依人爲生。生之死之。操之人手。即此一事。對於我民族之威脅。已覺其十分嚴重。</p>
<p>不僅此也。由於農村經濟之破落。農民生活日即於艱難。於是可怖之騷動。即發現於農村。且日呈燎原之勢。即如江浙各地。所謂「吃大戶」之事。更迭見不一。最近揚州以淸理田賦。且肇成空前之慘變。由於餓之煎逼原始之農民暴動。亦日益擴大。吾人如略一審視當前之事實。即可知當前之農村恐慌。已擴大而爲政治恐慌。吾人日言安定社會秩序。日言戡定動亂。而於此動亂之根源。反若無視。此則至爲矛盾之現象也。</p>
<p>就立國之基礎言。就民族之生命言。就人民之生計言。就社會之秩序言。吾人認救濟農村。實已爲當前刻不容緩之急務。吾人切盼國都着目於此一問題。並以最大之努力。求此一問題之解决。</p>

<p>社會黨人與國家主義派衝突</p>
<p>暴動羣衆復進攻保安團警察</p>
<p>機關槍射死十餘人傷數十人</p>
<p>步兵仍警戒工會討論總罷工</p>
<p>國民社九日日内瓦電此處素爲平靜著稱之區域、今日忽有暴亂發生、據最近之報告、死者十人、傷者有五十三人之多、其起點爲新組織之國家主義派集會、社會黨及共產黨意圖攻入國家主義派集議之會塲、雙方爭鬥、警察彈壓無效、不得不向保安團求救、而暴動羣衆、竟奪保安團之槍械、致保安團退至鄰近地帶、羣衆復進攻保安團、遂以機關槍掃射、雙方相持良久、至臨暮羣衆始陸續散去、現社會黨及共產黨集議、擬自明日起全市罷工云、</p>
<p>▲國民社十日日内瓦電昨夜流血暴動案内死亡人數、截至今晨十時止、巳達十二名、而重傷者六十五人中、尙有數名、恐無痊望、此時局勢仍極緊張、日内瓦州參事會、昨夜緊急會議、因預料社會黨與共產黨將實行其總罷工之威脅、已决定命軍隊及警察嚴爲戒備之、</p>
<p>▲路透社九日日内瓦日内瓦湖旁、今日發生騷擾、致有示威者三人、死於機關砲火之下、示威行動原爲反對社會黨領袖二人而起、繼而變成騷亂、警察出而彈壓、但爲暴衆所逐、步兵一隊及敎練兵若干、奉命出援、但亦爲暴衆所敺擊、暴民愈集愈多、奪取兵警槍械、而追逐之、軍警不得巳、向後退走、但又爲伏衆所圍攻、軍隊後乃開放機關槍、死三人、傷三十人左右、</p>
<p>▲國民社九日日内瓦電社會黨員結隊往國聯請願反對戰爭、被阻不得入、遂游行街衢、致與警察衝突、乃圖攻擊本市兵營、奪取武器、致釀成大衝突、共死八人、傷四十一人、當道急由洛桑調到援警、始克恢復秩序、社會黨旣告失敗、聞正計劃明日總罷工、按今日社會黨員、在國聯被阻後、乃奔向本市兵營、兵士攔附、則攫去其槍、推仆路旁、於是兵士被迫開槍、乃示威者退而復進、兵士開放機關槍、示威者亦有携槍還擊者、遂致死傷多人、事後檢點、警察亦死一人、傷十五人、</p>
<p>▲路透社十日日内瓦電昨日此間騷擾中之死傷數、較初報爲多、現悉共死十人、傷四十一人、第一批派出之軍隊、未携子彈、致被暴動者所逐退、但後調出之一隊、則彈械俱全、聞機關槍彈發出甚低、蓋軍隊不欲高射、致多死傷也、</p>
<p>▲國民社十日日内瓦電今日此間警吏告記者、倫敦報載、昨日社會黨人暴動、傷五十人死十五人之說、並非確語、當援警開到紛擾平息後、未再發生事故、至死傷人數、極難調查、最近報告、共死十人、傷六十五人、現此間街衢中警察、乘汽車巡邏不絕、國聯秘書廳派有大隊保護、據警吏聲稱、倘社曾黨計劃總罷工、發生紛擾、則準備迅速制止云、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯社十日日内瓦電日内瓦一地全世界均視爲和平思想關連者、昨日晚間乃成爲流血塲所、計共死十人、傷四十四人、其中三人受重傷、日内瓦昨晚有示威運動、顯然帶有過激性質、先是、右派擬在一關閉之塲所開會、其發起人因日内瓦急進黨政府尊重言論自由權利、乃决定舉行此種集會、而日内瓦社會黨則在其機關報「勞工」報中、竭力反對、但日内瓦邦行政院、不爲所動、社會黨乃對黨員發出下列訓令、即㈠令各黨員佯作顧客模樣、於晚間七時佔據該區所有之咖啡館、㈡佔據會場、㈢如佔據會場不能辦到、則在會場外滋擾、勿使開會㈣憲兵如出而干涉、須加以抵抗、即用暴力亦所不辭、同時並佔據各街道、此外又令示威人諸、各備胡椒若干、俾向維持秩序之憲兵面部抛擲、示威諸人、係由日内瓦社會黨共產黨及日内瓦失業工人中招募而來其數約有五千之多、按日内瓦社會黨向與瑞土社會黨不洽、亦不屬于第二國際、該黨多年以來、即藉口當地某某醜行、乘居民憤慨之便、而滋生事端、昨晚舉行集會者、係國民同盟、其中份子擬以堅决態度、阻遏日内瓦社會黨擾亂秩序之行爲、當紛擾發生之際、該黨領袖尼哥拉在憲兵之前告誡黨員、謂「革命在此際已屬必要、汝輩應服從命令、佔據街道勿消退讓」云云、日内瓦步兵營新兵、當即馳至、以謀恢復秩序、此等兵士人數頗少、且未帶有子彈、於是尼哥拉所發命令、即爲其黨員所執行、步兵營旣被攻擊、又被奪云武裝、該黨員等、正擬開始放槍時、適援兵己至、乃開入手提機關槍、以事鎭壓、日内瓦行政院、當即召集特别會議、尼哥拉即時被捕、爲預防再行發生紛擾起見、日内瓦步兵營、仍在警戒中、大勢巳漸歸平靜、但工會則正在開會、討論是否宣布同盟罷工、</p>

<p>胡佛邀羅斯福至白宮晤談</p>
<p>史汀生認遠東政策不變更</p>
<p>民主黨操縱國會酒禁將解</p>
<p>國民社九日紐約電選舉旣竣、共和黨今日乃重事維持將殘之政局準備明年三月四日移交白宮新主人、胡佛總統在巴羅亞爾都家中淸晨即起、邀集新聞記者、告以擬於星期六啓程返京後、即着手草擬將於國會内發表之行政報告、至明年三月獲卸卸屑後、即將返居故里重、理私人事業、惟關於未來工作之性質、此時尙未籌及、</p>
<p>當選總統羅斯福、今晨則在紐約就無線電台播放答謝選民電、羅謂此次選舉、其所蘊義、更有甚於黨派之見者、實可謂全國自由思想之表示、足徵通國之内、對於前途、咸抱有確切之信任、余旣奉此明晰之大命、謹當永矢弗忘、敬邀諸君共襄匡濟大業云、</p>
<p>嗣又電復胡佛總統、答謝昨日之祝賀、並電衆院議長茄納、賀其當選副總統、酬應旣畢、遂亦開始準備將在紐約州議會内發表之報告、</p>
<p>至當選副總統茄納、巳在選舉前一日、赴塔克薩斯州曠野釣魚、曾聲言準備於星期四聆選舉消息、逆料羅氏賀電、或須至明日方能接閱也、</p>
<p>當此各方賀電交馳之際、疲乏之檢票員、依然埋首工作據稱、共檢得二千八百餘萬票、羅斯福有一千六百五十三萬九千餘票、胡佛有一千一百九十四萬七千餘票、社會黨候選人湯麥士有三十五萬九千餘票、（按上届選舉社會黨祇有二六七·四二○票、）此項總數、仍不致變更前此報告之各黨形勢、逆料擬選時、羅斯福可得四百七十二票胡佛可得五十九票、</p>
<p>國會内衆院各黨之分野、雖或容有小變更、但民主黨確可如在參院之占優勢、並料新衆院内、對於解弛酒禁、亦有强烈之傾嚮云、</p>
<p>▲國民社九日華盛頓電美國務卿史汀生、今日表示、共和黨政府决不留困難問題交民主黨解决、史氏曾向新聞記者聲稱、渠認就可能方面、盡力協助民主黨、乃渠之職分、並表示關於遠東問題、雙方政策實際毫無殊異、又謂渠在卸任以前、將循現行政策、盡力合作、以謀移交之便利、又參議員史潢生、外間咸有參議院外交委員會新主席之目、今日亦稱、在遠東政策上、即有變更、亦極微細、惟菲島獨立問題、在本届國會内、恐或未必能解决、因新當選之議員、或將與視有舊議員意見、未必盡同也、</p>

<p>自由談	二一枝譚珍珠鱗  瞻廬　　蘇州金魚展覽會，與菊花會同時舉行··菊花會每年一舉，金魚展覽，也是第二次；其中名種至多，有珍珠鱗四尾，細鱗圓如珍珠，更足引起觀衆的興趣。　　珍殊鱗的名貴，不自今始，在昔巳是罕見。淸道光戊戍，定遠方調臣先生偶養金魚數十尾，其中有一珍珠鱗，頭額紅如鶴頂，尾作羊脂玉色，細鱗突起，顆顆圓若珍珠。一時哄動鄕里，爭來參觀這尾身披珍珠衫的金魚，待到來年二月，方先生把它放入荷池，悠然而逝，大有其所哉的樂趣。這是金魚珍聞中的一椿帮事。　　方先生四持堂詩稿中·有七古一首，歌詠這尾珍珠鱗，每句押韻，用的是柏梁體，我把這首詩轉載如左：我家盆池淸且漣，中有游魚洋洋焉；一魚赤麟白其顚，一魚碎點如星懸；或靑或白色殊連，凡此那足誇人前？其中一魚眞矯然，細鱗突起比珠圓，分明一一相回旋；周身的礫銀絲穿，玉尾長曳可及肩；游行大腹何便便？更奇魚額紅而鮮，色若珊瑚團若錢；或分鶴頂或胎仙，乘軒貴客聊潘淵。嗟余頭黑守冷氈，講堂何日來三　？池中雖困莫受憐，有時變化能登天！世人羡汝色相全，鄙哉貌取非眞賢！知魚之樂我獨偏，我戕縱汝大壑邊，義軍給予我伞的印像  周才良　　丨傷心慘目有如是耶丨　　前天恰値休假，我偶在馬路上閒逛，忽聽得後面幾個報販高喊着「阿要看東洋人殺死東北義勇軍的畫報嗎？」聲調很是凄切，我爲好厅心所動，所以就跑過去買了一份來看，那知不瞧便罷，瞧了我的眼淚要奪眶而出，原來這幾幅畫圖，都是我們義軍慘遭日人酷刑的寫照，我覺得很有廣事宣傳的價値，所以就把它約略記些出來。　　首先刺入我眼簾的一頁，便是有十來個我們民族英雄的義勇軍，竟被許多日兵迫作俘虜，反綁着手，頸插斬旗，衣衫破爛，隱約可見，大槪是押送刑塲的模樣，其次就有一大羣傀儡國的僞警，帮同日兵處决義軍，低首下心，醜態畢現，場旁還站滿着許多日僑，環視義軍就義，似乎都有眉飛色舞的神氣，再次好像在廣大的草地上，遠望跪立着七八位氣宇軒昂的義軍，泰然自若，引頸就戮，大有史可法所謂，「頭可斷志不可屈」的亮節高風，確足爲我們民族前途生色，我雖不忍復覩，然而一種悲壯熱烈的情緒，却已深印腦際而永難磨滅，最後所見的内容，竟是意想不到的自號文明國軍隊所用處决我們義軍的鍘刑，殘忍可謂至極，而且弄具旁還遺留着幾駡樓重閻　　究竟人類是萬能的動物，所以人類就比較其他動物多一種駡的技能。　　駡，這一種技能，也不知是那一位聰明者所創造的？它的勢力也可算是大極了！它能使你面紅，使你氣僨，甚于使你拚命······　　張三駡李四是猪玀，李四駡張三是烏龜，其實張三李四都不是猪玀烏龜，然而他們竟會因此閙得不可開交，這京是駡的效用。　　甲對乙有不滿的地方，儘可當面規勸，或者斷絕往來，然而却要施行於事實無補的詈駡，結果彼此徒然增加一重惡感。更可怪的是社會上有一種人丨當面對你恭維備至，背後却又駡你一文不値，所謂「陰陽兩面」，這般人簡直連駡的主意都不能貫澈了！　　『當面駡人人還駡，背後駡人結冤仇』，因駡成仇，因仇致命，這無意議的『駡』底一字，造成了人間多少罪惡？個支離破碎的義軍頭顱，身爲國殤，血濺芳草，怎不使人嗚咽飲泣而長漢着國無干城民遭毒手的多麽可痛可恨啊！我寫到這裏，心中宛似刀割，很希望今後全國同胞們，再也不要鬧出一些亂子來，應該大家各盡厥職，即所以共赴國難，一方面還須牢記着這幾幾幅敵兵慘殺我們義軍的圖畫，以作他日報仇雪恥的預備，（如遇不識字的同胞，最好講給他聽，）先哲所謂「念茲在兹，毋忝爾所生，」就是我們救國唯一的途徑。影業學校化  魯逵　　丨電影界的新氣象丨　　中國的商人似乎是守舊派的代表，試看中國的商店，除了幾家極少數的大公司，組織着什麽同人俱樂部等以外，那一家不是暮氣沉沉，保守着十八世紀的風氣。　　電影本來是一種新的事業，雖然從事電影事業的人，也脫不了營業性質，但是比較其他的商業，多少有些不同，因爲電影是藝術，而且負有社會敎育的使命。　　我們知道業餘的娛樂，是生活上極需要的，演員除了表演藝術之外，體格的健美，也是很關重要的。　可是中國從事電影事業的當局，誰也沒有注意到，各公司裏沟有什麽業餘娛樂和業餘運動的設備。　　天一公司近年來很有蓬蓬勃勃的新氣象，從前本有業餘娛樂和運動可是規模很小，設備也不完備。最近積極擴充，把個俱樂部和運動塲，完全組織成立。俱樂部分音樂組·平劇組·圍棋組·象棋組·乒乓組·等，運動塲在攝影塲的旁邊，裝置着籃球架·秋千·浪木·鐵槓·軒輕板·等運動器械，不知道的人，還當做是什麽學校的體育塲。每日辦公時間完了，一班職員演員和工匠們，有的在俱樂部裏奕棋·唱戲·弄樂器·有的在運動埸上運動，把一個公司變成學校化。聽說他們還要添設網球·游泳·足球·等項，練習到相當程度，或許和其他業餘團體的球隊，作友誼的比賽，　　我以爲這不但是電影界的好現象，也可說是中國商業界的好現象，我很希望範圍較大的公司，起而仿行，一定有很好的成效。看花觀魚記  啟　　丨蘇州公園頻添幾許盛况丨　　公園之有菊花金魚展覽會，已三日於茲矣，初以天氣陰寒，欲行未果。六日下午，應友人之請，乃欣然往游，至則士女如雲：車馬如水；五卅路上，頻添幾許盛况！　　入門左折，達菊花宮，走道惟一，蜿蜒曲折，循次而進，秩序井然。中置菊花千餘本，翠葉雲佈；黃蕊星羅，置身其中，衣襟俱綠；菊花宮之名，洵不虚也。　　菊之良者，均列西亭：冰姿玉質，搖曳生香，如綠牡丹，金睡桃，西施浣紗，紫綬金章等，俱稱名貴，吳門佳色，齊收一堂，眼福可謂不淺也。　　已而至金魚陳列處，大盆小甌，俱畜金魚，浮沉往還，翕然自然，有鱗珍珠者；有頂戴肉堆者；有頭生絨球者；更有朝天龍，水泡眼者；或金鱗頳尾；或雪片銀花；鼓腹若豕；怒目如蛙；名種奇品，不可殫述，紫羅蘭盦主人亦有出品，如紫羅蘭瑤臺月玲瓏玉八寳裝等題名淸麗，爲名魚生色不少。　　塲中附陳綠毛龜二，綠毛毶毶，漾水盡碧；象牙龜一，睛如硃砂，閃爍有光，體僅盈寸，作象牙色·曳尾引首·彌覺可珍也，短訊  楓創辦迄今已二十三載之雅歌集，於十一日起，在北京路貴州路口湖社羣行彩排三天，該集徵求會自開始後，成績殊佳，十二日並舉行第一次揭曉云。又訊  東注海門凌宴池先生的藝術，久已馳名華北；近幾天正在寗波同鄕會公開展覽，作品之多，出人意外。他的作品。盡量拿詩意來表現畫量，因爲凌氏擅詩書畫三絕，故其内在精力的飽滿，創造力的偉大，眞是値得推崇的了。死之贫道㈩㈠  范烟橋　　「少爺？」這個名詞，在未經納爲　室以前，送到慕良的耳鼓上，非常的圓妙親熱，現在聽去，非常刺耳，因爲他在首都，只聽慣，「同志」「先生」「密斯　」等等名詞，再也沒有這種陳腐，而含有封建色采的「少爺」的稱呼了，他已覺悟時代落伍者，便面目可憎，語言無味了，進一步說，因着語言無味，纔致面可憎，備具了這兩條資格的人，便是時代落伍者，所以他非常的不高興，只答伊一個「唔字，」並且半個「唔」字的聲音，逗留在嘴裡，始終沒有入出嘴外來。　　他還想嘗試，用一番功夫，把伊們拉上摩登的路，自居於推動的地位。晚上，帶着兩位夫人到影戲場去，左右分坐着，論理是很可以傲視一切了，但是在影戲場裡，兩性相並着坐，在說笑，比自己所享有的，藝術得不少，他們伊們是生動的這裡是死寂的，單就坐的姿勢說，已經相形見絀了。　　「巧克力糖要哦？冰結漣要哦？」在前奏曲未響動以前，川流不息的在通路間向各個座位上兜攪。慕良摸出幾個銀角子來，各樣買了一點，分給左右兩位夫人喫，大夫人咬了一口冰結漣，連忙吐云說：　　「冷得很，牙齒都激痛了，你也不要喫罷，到底九月裏，不配喫水了。」　　慕良正要說：外國人一年到頭喫冰的，一面燒着電氣火爐，一面喫冰結漣呢。怒說而未說，如夫人又把巧克力糖吐向地下去了，慕良格格的笑，愛姑縐着的眉頭，還沒有展開，似笑非笑的說：　　「苦來」！</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　言打招呼  佛　　丨處世藝術之七丨　　打招呼三字。在上海中下級社會裏頗爲通行，因做上海人，以兜得轉爲原則，若一時或一處兜不轉，便想去打招呼，這就是上海地方特别善於做人處，　　一個小弟兄在女色上面闖了禍事，馬上想法去打個招呼，打得通最好，打不通再想辦法，一個朋友打壞了人，亦馬上去想法打個招呼，如其空口打不通，便送些東西去打通，故打招呼的方法，最爲妙用，非但小事可以打招呼，任何鉅大的事，都可以打招呼，即任何違法的事，亦可以打招呼，　　袁世凱要做皇帝，不惜製造民意，運用金錢，去各處打招呼，結果有的地方雖打通了，有的地方還是打不通，所以失敗，現在美國新任大總統，選舉前到處演說，到處運動，對於全美打了一個大招呼，因爲同情的多，反對的少，結果被他打通了，這也是善於打招呼的妙處，　　但打招呼也要看打招呼的事情，假如袁世凱要做皇帝，違反潮流，違反民意，打招呼天然比較不容易，若羅斯福順應潮流，又得民意，是以招呼容易打過去，現在的中國，比較袁氏時代，有些不同，任何犯法的事，只要在幾個專門替人家打招呼的人，打打招呼，就得沒事，　　故上海的社會，自有一種特别情形，特别組織法，祇要你有手段，有能力，無論什麽招呼，都可以打得通，而自然無人敢出來反對，此上海社會之所以成爲上海社會歟，文藝鵲橋仙  鮑增育　　葡醪綠泛，櫻唇紅溜，狂攬蠻腰醉舞，情歌蜜吻樂昇平，誰夢見，遼東塊土白山雪滿，黑河水結，敝械單衣禦侮，軍書飛急動江關，醒也未，後庭玉樹，感懷徐禮菖　　世情色色復形形，沉醉何人能自醒老去胸懷今更坦，歲寒松柏獨留靑，凄凉往事奚須問，災刦頻年任屢經，只有殘編宜愛護，蕉窓夜夜聽秋聲，科學擬創製脚踏船之說明  芮禹成　　輪船發明以來，數百年於茲矣。世界列强航業，莫不恃乎輪船；而交通事業之進步，頗有一日千里之勢。近今我國亦以輪船爲水面交通之具，惟航路僅及通商大埠，其他内地及汊港分歧之處，仍以帆船爲多。然而帆船何能與輪船敵。行程固屬遲緩，駕駛尤覺困難，吾國航業不振良有以也。若舉帆船而盡廢之乎是！是奴財力所難勝再四　　，或於脚踏船之製作，實有不容或緩之勢。蓋是船之速度，必遠勝於舊帆船··且内部之構造簡單，造作之費用微省··果能努力推行，則内地航業之發達，未始無希望也。茲特略陳梗槪，以供海内實業家科學家之研究。倘蒙指敎，則幸甚矣！　　㈠定名脚踏車之行動專恃脚，而脚踏船之行動亦恃乎脚，故以脚踏名之。　　㈡形狀船以木製，頭类尾圓，長約二丈，寛約六尺，上有棚，後有舵，與舊式之脚划船相似。　　全圖　　㈢構造艙中後部，置脚踏機。Ａ爲案面，ＢＢ爲脚踏板，ＣＤ爲屈折横軸，ＥＥ爲鋼條，Ｆ爲大輪，（如第二圖Ｆ）Ｇ爲小輪，（如第二圖Ｇ（Ｈ爲關鍵鋼條，（如第二圖Ｈ）Ｉ爲撥水機，Ｊ爲撥舵輪，ＫＫ爲握手器，Ｌ爲舵，ＭＭ爲十　　第一圖</p>

<p>電影專刊中華民國貳拾壹年拾壹月拾壹日星期伍海外要聞電影界羅致的運動人才  嘉南　　偉大和雄壯的第十届亞林匹克運動會已閉幕了，四十餘國的健兒，十天左右的熱烈競爭，引起了百萬多人的歡迎和欽仰，尤其是近水樓台的一班好萊塢電影老闆們，想把這許男女的雄糾糾氣昂昂的精神，移到銀幕上來給電影觀衆們來欣賞，　　第一個是紐約選手霍爾姆女士EleanoHolm，當她奪到百米背泳的錦標時，就被華納公司聘了去，她本來是很有名的FlorenzZiegfeld的舞台演員，幾個月的訓練，一定就可成功，但她還要求不要因拍電影而阻礙她游泳的習練，　　小妹妹娉登DotothyPoynton是本市丨羣仙市的跳水選手，她的芳齡僅十七歲，她有白金色的頭髮，巧小玲瓏的身段，圓圓的眼兒，所以很容易被電影公司招致了去，　　西雅圖的游泳選手密司麥蒂生HeleneMadison她這次曾打破了大大紀錄，現在巳和JohnClein丨獨立製片者訂了合同，柯爾曼小姐GeorgiaColeman也是本市的一個跳水選手，現在正在應徵電影試騐中，　　奪得了大會游泳錦標的克萊勃BusterCrabbe，和霍羅蘭GeorgeHalloran已巳在派拉蒙公司徵應試騐之中，不久就好訂合同，瑞典跳水女選手蕭吉斯女士IngeborgSiopuist也在同時受試中，可是她還得學翫英語，　　柴巴拉JoseZabala是一個阿根迁靑年，當他跑完二十六英里馬拉松賽跑後，就有兩個製片人來招致他，但他不肯離開他的祖國，他情願仍做他的報販，最後只好讓他跳躍着回去了，天一公司有聲影片主角袁美雲女士（影片談評）評「桃花亂放」  燕南　　　　雷電華自從内部改組以後，出片不止是量數增加，進步得的確很可觀。這次在南京開映的桃花亂放PeachO'Reno，就是雷電華的新出品。　　以表演方面說，一個滑稽片子，配角這麽整齊，的確很難能的。惠爾勒前半部很少，後半部扮女裝非常像，並且很美。提琴拉得很好。何爾塞的確是這片中的中心人物，所造成的笑料也最多，他們兩人的同歌同舞，是叭一拿手戲。桃樂賽李除一段歌舞以外，未見所長，恐怕是大材小用的原故。　　處處找得着滑稽的笑料，一些穿挿都含着舞台趣劇的風味。在這片子中，佈景費一定和奶可驚。因爲滑稽片而用那種富麗的裝璜，機關的傢具是很少的。　　情節的確像南京的廣告一樣丨丨荒乎其唐豈有此理。因爲這樣，才能在荒唐無理中，造成無數笑料，一舉一動，沒有一件是情理上說得過去的。當然我們（新片介紹）天一有聲新自「小女伶」  熙　　天一影片公司有聲新片「小女伶」，是裘芭香導演袁美雲主演，裘芭香脫離電影界多年了，這次被天一老闆邵醉翁重行聘他做導演，第一次作品「蘭谷萍踪很得與論贊譽，「小女伶」是繼「蘭谷萍踪」的作品，聽說成績也很不差。主角袁美雲，是本來一位著名的小女伶，這一部影片，還是她的處女作。由一個小女伶來主演「小女伶」，定可當得當行出色四個字吧。看這片子，目的是「買笑」，並不是去找什麽深刻的意義的。如果一個人到滑稽片中去找眞理，他京是傻子。　　片中有一個地位，似乎有些諷世的成份在内，就是盡力形容律師業未來的趨勢，世界上離婚的普遍，和法律進步不祥的現象。　　希望要在電影中得些可樂的事的，應當到南京去一趟，而且過幾天之後，再溫溫這片子的神韻，自己一個人也許忍不住要笑的。本埠調查在「狂流」中的明星公司  紅　　│制片公訪問記之二　　明星公司，可以算是中國影片公司的老前輩了，它從小資本，慘淡經營，終於成爲今日一個規模最大，出品最多，歷史最久的大公司，雖然近年來，因爲直接間接受着中國戰事和世界經濟恐慌的影響，尤其是爲了「啼笑因緣」的糾紛，着實吃了不少損失，然而，它那有計劃有步驟的經營，│用默片以調劑其營業，│竟使它在中國影業上，依然能夠佔着第一把交椅，這是値得我們佩服的，　　本着求進的心，明星公司，便銳意的搜集各項的新人材，│編劇有黃子布等，導演有李萍倩等，女演員有胡萍，王瑩等，男演員有孫敏等，眞可謂極一時之盛，　　但是，明星的出品，向來是封建氣氛很濃厚，而它所吸收的觀衆，也就祇是小市民層的人物，現在却有點不然了，我們且看最近公映的「戀愛與生命」，「可愛的仇敵」，和已攝竣而未公映的「失戀」，「舊恨新愁」，等片子，是怎樣的趨向新的方面發展，便可以推想到明星公司的「老當益壯」了，提倡儉約的陳玉梅女士影界珍聞向卓别麟要錢的人  黃影呆　　藥方當票都會寄去　　在銀幕上成了明星以後，就會有許多銀幕下的觀衆，不斷的把信送給他們，在好萊塢，最有名的明星，每天也許會有幾千封信送來的，卓别麟是一個數一數二的大明星，當然的，他在好萊塢，每天也會有人把許多的信，送給他，但他除了明星之外，同時還是一個財富，所以除了寫信給他，贊美或稱頌他的出品之外，還有人寫信來向他要錢呢。　　「你有千百萬的財產，我所需要的不過滄海一粟，請你不要鄙吝吧？因爲我如果沒有人接替，馬上要遠離人世了！」這便是許多請求的信衷，所必具的幾句話，最近美國西部在一隻小敎堂裏，有一位牧師，寫信給他要求他捐助一○，○○○元的美金，因爲他要建造一隻新的敎堂，同時，爲保證單氏的震魂永久愉快起見，要捐助二○，○○○元的美金，收到了卓氏的匯欵而後，在那敎堂裡，將每天爲卓氏祈禱。　　另外有一封很可憐的信，是一個十二歲的小孩，生長在加拿大，他病得很重，在垂死之前，他不過寫信索取卓别麟親筆簽字的一張照片，卓别麟自然答應了他，但照片寄出而後，同時又來了一封信，要卓氏馬上乘火車到加拿大去，和那小孩會一下面，因爲醫生說除了這方法以外，是不能救活這孩子了，因爲事實上辦不到，卓氏便馬上親筆寫了一封極誠懇的信去，安慰他，並且十二分的抱憾，因爲不能親到加拿大，但回信不久又寄到了，要卓氏匯金洋五百元去，這樣那孩子的保護者，能夠帶了病人到好萊塢和卓氏會一下面，卓氏便馬上匯去，絕無躭擱。　　從事實上說來，幾百的人們，時常把他們的藥方，寄給卓别麟，和他借錢，有的連當票都會寄來。　　在目下的中國製片公司中，明星堪稱爲設備最完全，│攝影場搆造合適，有聲機器裝置的得當，燈光最齊備，│……的一家，據明星當局說，將於最近期内，搬往新址，│楓淋橋│工作，幷决於明春設分公司於北平，至於明年出品的計劃，决朝新的路上走去，又是一件嘉寳的秘事  心影壇韻事明星的服裝  麥　　現時電影界，誰都知道有一位提倡儉約的女明星，她是誰？就是天一公司陳玉梅，前兩天陳女士上寗波同鄕會赴宴。那天是她的同事傅桂鳳女士出閣，當日到的男女明星很多，差不多都是盛裝華服，維有陳女士穿的是灰色的布衣，而且臉不敷粉，髮不燙捲，耳不戴環，脚上穿了一雙黑緞綉花平底鞋，但是手上可戴了兩隻金鋼鑽的戒指，儉約可算到家了。　　同時王慧娟女士穿一件錦花衣，據嘉寳GretaGarboo在脫離好萊塢以前。她拒絕同華納威脈WarnerWilliam。在TheMatchKing（火柴大王）片中合演。許多人都懷疑。因爲她平素不是這種苛求人的人。但是事實是這樣的。這片子的本事是根據瑞典已故火柴大王克魯格IvanKrueger的事蹟而編成的。克魯格生前和嘉寳。有過密切的友誼。並且他的一部份遺物。被嘉寳用一萬元買了去。嘉寳懷念舊愛。當然對於這張片子。有不堪迴首之感。我們不應當原諒她嗎？後來這片的女主角。是用李蓮黛密她LilyDamita。代替了她。她自己告訴人家，那是「東洋」綢，大家都很詫異，以爲那東洋貨，早經公民禁用，她居然穿了還自誇耀地說出來。　　陸麗霞女士也是天一明星，她穿了一套素服（絲質的）去當女儐相，衣服是灰色的，皮鞋絲襪統是黑色的，而且灰黃的臉兒十分喪氣，胡姗女士走去說她不該那樣打扮，該把花色衣服穿出來，陸女士被她說得無言可答，祇說：「我一向愛的就是如此裝束」　　胡姗女士自己穿了一件花絲絨的長旗袍，也不燙髮，脚上也是黑鞋襪，可是多了一件絲絨大衣，耳上加環，手上加飾。她轉了一轉就走了，四人之中的比較，她還是最入時的。本埠瑣聞電影敎育研究會成立訊  紅　　戲劇專家魯史等，有鑒於電影藝術對於敎育的效用之深且廣，特爲發起組織一個研究會，專在有意義的敎育上面努力，使電影藝術，成爲最犀利的社會敎育工具，經一度議後，决先編撰幾本含有敎育意味的劇本，供給各大公司攝製云。陳玉梅播音  龍子　　唱新曲儉約歌　　陳玉梅在「芸蘭姑娘」有聲影片中唱的「燕雙飛」」花弄影」「催眠曲」三支歌，經百代公司收爲唱片後，本埠各無線電播音台都把這新片來播音，現在各無線電台想換新花樣，於是託人去向陳玉梅商請，請她去播音，她近來正在竭力提倡儉約，便請高天棲高季琳馬陋芬等，特編了幾支「儉約歌」，聞已排定日期的，有永生公司無線電播音台，（六日晚八時半）友聯廣播無線電台，（七日晚八時半）中西藥房無線電播音台，（八日晚八時半）云。電影專著有聲片使表演藝術退化了  陳大悲　　有聲影片實現以後，美國電影界裏差不多來了一次大革命。而這次革命的結果就是以歌舞見長的舞台名角取從前一班以表演見長的明影明星而代之。但是這不過像政治革命一樣的，在大革命以後，難免有一個惡勢力的反動時期。這種時期當然不能會有長久的生命的。不過在美國影片的表演藝術上可來了一個大打擊，這是可以借一般美國運來的聲片來證明的。　　中國人從事於影片攝製歸根結蒂祇有十多年的歷史。中國的影片市塲向來爲美國片所獨佔。所以美國人的『明星狂熱病』的沾染。當然是無法避免的事。但是這狂熱的傳染性在中國社會裏是萬不至於繼長增高的。中國人在别的事業上能不能比美國人哟，我不敢武斷。惟有這羣衆心裏的盲從病。似乎尙不至於像美國人那樣的傳染得厲害吧。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Seriousness of the Rural Problem Indeed <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Our nation's most serious problem currently is none other than the rural problem. The most urgent task currently is also none other than rescuing the rural areas.</p>
<p>Our nation is founded on agriculture. In terms of population proportion, farmers account for more than 80% of the national population. In terms of foreign trade, the export value of agricultural products also accounts for about 90% of our nation's total exports. In terms of the national economy, the agricultural economy, until now, is still a major component of our nation's economy. Therefore, agriculture is the foundation of our country, and also the lifeblood of our country. In recent years, our nation's finances have been on the verge of exhaustion, and the social economy has also been severely damaged. However, the reason why we can still struggle and persevere in this precarious situation is because the rural areas can still be relied upon to "cut flesh to heal sores."</p>
<p>Since the capital forces of advanced industrial countries in Western Europe invaded our country, our rural economy has fallen into a process of decay and decline, becoming an appendage of foreign industrial economies. Domestic politics have been chaotic for a long time, civil wars have been continuous, bandits have risen in swarms, disasters have struck repeatedly, and exorbitant taxes and levies have been imposed relentlessly. Thus, the rural areas have no chance to recover. Especially since the nationwide floods of last year, the rural areas have shown an even more evident trend of complete collapse. Although this year is a year of abundant harvests, even an abundant harvest cannot save the desolation of the rural areas or stop the death of farmers. Moreover, it only serves to deepen the degree of panic and cause more farmers to become displaced. In Wuyuan, Suiyuan, 260 catties of red sorghum are only worth 7 jiao. Millet is also only worth a little more than 7 jiao. Even in places like Jiangsu and Zhejiang, grain prices are as low as more than two yuan. Farmers who cultivate one mu of land even lose several yuan. The fact that farmers have no food despite an abundant harvest, and that the substance of this abundant harvest is different from the surplus in the United States or Japan, reveals in a nutshell an acceleration of the collapse of the rural areas and a deepening of the agricultural panic. In past years, our nation's agricultural exports, silk and tea, were the main commodities. In recent years, the silk and tea industries have declined sharply. In Zhejiang, a famous silk cocoon production area in the 18th year of the Republic [1929], the cocoon production was about 1.1 million dan. In the 19th year of the Republic [1930], it decreased by one-fifth. In the 20th year of the Republic [1931], it decreased by another one-fifth. As for this year, it has decreased even more sharply, and sales have stagnated. There is merchandise but no market, and prices have fallen drastically, failing to cover costs. More families that grow mulberry trees and raise silkworms are burning cocoons and digging up mulberry trees, crying in despair. The future of the silk industry seems to have no hope of revival. As for the tea industry, in the 18th century, Chinese tea monopolized the world market. However, in recent decades, the market has been seized by others, and the output has declined sharply. The golden age of the 18th century seems to exist only in our memories and can never be recovered. The situation of tea and silk is already like this, and food, which is essential for daily life, is flooding in from foreign countries. For a country founded on agriculture to depend on others for the daily necessities of life such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, we do not even need to talk about the concern that the social economy will collapse. The fact that our lives depend on others and that our life and death are controlled by others is already a very serious threat to our nation.</p>
<p>Not only that, but due to the decline of the rural economy, farmers' lives are becoming increasingly difficult. Thus, terrible disturbances are emerging in the rural areas and are showing a trend of spreading like wildfire. In places like Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the so-called "eating the big households" incidents are happening repeatedly. Recently, in Yangzhou, the clearing of land taxes has even led to unprecedented tragedies. Primitive peasant uprisings, driven by the torment of hunger, are also expanding day by day. If we take a brief look at the current facts, we can see that the current rural panic has expanded into a political panic. We talk about stabilizing social order and suppressing turmoil every day, but we seem to ignore the root cause of this turmoil. This is an extremely contradictory phenomenon.</p>
<p>In terms of the foundation of the country, the life of the nation, the livelihood of the people, and the order of society, we believe that rescuing the rural areas is an urgent task that brooks no delay. We sincerely hope that the national government will focus on this issue and make the greatest efforts to solve it.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends a Telegram of Congratulations to Roosevelt</p>
<h3 id="e15">The United States' Foreign Policy Will Not Change Much <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>It will cooperate closely with the League of Nations on the Sino-Japanese issue</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The US election has now been revealed. Democratic candidate Roosevelt has won and Hoover will serve as the next president. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send a telegram to congratulate him. Diplomatic circles here expected Roosevelt's election and are not surprised. They also believe that after President Roosevelt takes office, his foreign policy will not change much from President Hoover's era, and he will cooperate more closely with the League of Nations on the Sino-Japanese issue. This is because the founder of the League of Nations was President Wilson during the Democratic Party's administration, and the Democratic Party's policy in recent years has still silently followed President Wilson's policy without any change. According to the US Constitution, Hoover will not complete his term until March next year, and Roosevelt will officially take office as president at that time. Before Roosevelt takes office, Hoover will continue to serve as usual, but all his administration will be conducted after consulting with Roosevelt. Therefore, the League of Nations' mediation of the Sino-Japanese issue can continue without interruption or stagnation. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A diplomatic figure said that the US Constitution stipulates that the president is elected through a direct election system. The primary election has been completed, and the re-election is still waiting until the second Monday of January next year. The winner will take office as the new president on July 4 next year. The Prime Minister of State may belong to Mr. Davis. His Far East policy, such as the Sino-Japanese issue, is consistent, and will never change his previous position due to the change of presidential candidates. Anyone who knows a little about American history will surely believe this. The United States will also be able to maintain its original intention on the issue of disarmament, and facts will prove this in the future. The rumor that the United States will change its direction on the Sino-Japanese issue in the future is either a lack of common sense or Japanese propaganda. Even the current President Hoover will never give up the major diplomatic events he is currently pursuing because he is about to step down. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Zeng Shen-ming, Roosevelt's election as president will not change the international position of the United States. His domestic policy may be somewhat changed. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin said that the results of yesterday's US presidential election showed that the Democratic presidential candidate Roosevelt was elected as the President of the United States. Those who are ignorant of the situation in the United States think that the United States' position on the Far East issue will change in the future. In fact, the United States originally had a consistent position on the Far East issue. According to my observation, Roosevelt's position on the Far East issue will not change much after he is elected, or it may become more active. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Ming, the former special envoy to Nepal, was a classmate of Roosevelt when he was in the United States, and they had a very good relationship. Because Roosevelt was elected as the President of the United States, he sent a telegram to congratulate him, hoping that he would support the Chinese government's diplomacy to solve all difficult problems as soon as possible after taking office.

<p>Zhang Xueliang Arrives in Hankou to Meet Chiang</p>
<h3 id="e16">He departed yesterday morning on his own plane <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>

(Special telegram on the 10th)</p>

<p>The Two Liu Armies</p>
<h3 id="e17">Decisive Battle in the Luzhou Area <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Personally Commands the Attack on Luzhou</p>
<p>Luzhou's defending soldiers dig holes for air defense</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Sichuan war is still in Luzhou. Liu Xiang is in command of the attack on Luzhou, determined to capture it. The aerial bombardment is particularly fierce. Liu Wenhui ordered the defending soldiers in Luzhou to dig holes for air defense, and all the people were ordered to leave the city and move to the rear. It is expected that the two Liu's will not easily cease the war unless they win or lose. However, Liu Wenhui's side claimed that it still adheres to the central government's policy of peace and is unwilling to counterattack. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Chongqing army launched a fierce attack on the Da Xiao Xi River in Luzhou from the 8th. Three planes dropped bombs along the city's riverbanks and were shot down by the provincial army's air defense team. The Chongqing army's Liao Brigade attempted to cross the river by force during the aerial bombardment and was repelled by the provincial army's Liu Regiment. The Dongdao side has a saying that a general offensive will be launched on the 11th. According to Liu Xiang's side, the various armies are advancing very rapidly, and Luzhou will be captured soon, and the war will be ended in a short period of time to achieve peace.

<p>(Nanjing) According to a telegram from Chengdu on the 9th: 1. Liu Wenhui secretly departed for Ziliujing due to the urgent military situation on the front lines, to command the armies in Zinei. 2. After the 21st Army occupied Xiaoshi, Luzhou County had no defenses to hold, and the warships were patrolling and threatening. Luzhou City will be captured within days. 3. Deng Xihou secretly ordered the various divisions and brigades under his command to prepare to move out. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) In the Luzhou war, the provincial army was hit by two Chongqing naval guns and retreated. In the afternoon, there was a local war. On the morning of the 8th, they launched a fierce attack on the ruins of Luzhou, and two planes dropped bombs from the air, causing many casualties to the people. Because one warship was bombed and destroyed yesterday, only one warship came to help, and then retreated. Because the Chongqing army took the offensive, it suffered heavy casualties. It is said that the Chongqing army's original plan was to first capture Luzhou, then take Fushun, and then launch a fierce attack on Zinei. According to observations of the two-day war, there is a trend of changing the plan and seeking another pursuit. The battle in the Gaoshikan area of Fushun was also quite fierce today, with no victory or defeat on either side. (Special telegram on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Chongqing: 1. The Luzhou war is at a stalemate. The Chongqing army is now completely assembled in Luzhou.

Now Minister He has sent a telegram saying that Liu's troops will directly board ships from Yantai and will no longer take over the navy's defense, in order to be quick. After Liu leaves, the navy will hand over the defense to the provincial army again. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) After the provincial army withdraws its defense, the magistrate of Yexian will move his office to Changyi, and the magistrates of Fushan and Huangxian will go to Yantai. The magistrate of Penglai will go to Changshan to avoid the situation. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>

The defense of Yantai will be undertaken by the navy. The cavalry brigade of the 3rd Route Army has now arrived in Yexian. It is also heard that He Yisan is scheduled to arrive in Yantai from Laiyang on the 11th to discuss everything with the navy and the monitors Gao Lingbai and Song Shishan. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Regarding the order for Liu Zhennian to move his defense to central Hubei, the military headquarters has directly telegraphed Liu to comply and stipulated three procedures. Liu's troops will no longer take over the defense of Yantai, but will directly take ships from their current stationed areas in Yantai to Haizhou and then transfer to Hubei via the Longhai Railway and the Pinghan Railway to suppress bandits. The 3rd Route Army's Huang Zhizhong Regiment and the cavalry brigade of Jiaodong arrived in Yexian on the 10th. The rest of the troops in various places, except for a small number stationed in Changyi and Pingdu to maintain law and order, have all withdrawn to the west. The siege troops in Yexian must be withdrawn by the 12th. Han told reporters on the 10th that the troops stationed in Pingdu have all been withdrawn to the south of Pingdu, and the troops stationed in Changyi have been withdrawn to the west of Changyi. A part of the cavalry brigade has returned to Qingzhou, and a part has gone to Changyi. Liu's troops will no longer take over the defense of Yantai, but will directly take ships south. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han's telegram arrived in Beiping on the 9th, reporting on the withdrawal of his troops. Liu Zhennian also said on the 9th that the Han army in Yexian had stopped attacking, but there was no news of withdrawal. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin said that the Jiaoji incident has now come to an end, because the Third Route Army has actually withdrawn, and the Marine Corps has taken over the defense of Yantai. It is expected that the Third Route Army will completely withdraw to western Weifang before the 12th. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Military Administration's Transportation Department has prepared twelve steamships to transport Liu Zhennian's troops from Yantai to Haizhou, and then to Hubei via the Longhai Railway and the Pinghan Railway to suppress bandits. Liu's representative in Nanjing, Yang Lichuan, visited the authorities of the Ministry of Military Administration, saying that the entire division of more than 30,000 people would require at least twenty ships to be sufficient, and that the sieges of Yexian and Laiyang must be lifted at the same time, and the bridges along the road from Laiyang to Yantai must be completely repaired, and then the troops will be concentrated in Laiyang and transported to Yantai by car. This is because the roads and bridges between Yantai and Laiyang have been completely destroyed by the Han army, and the road from Laiyang to Yantai is 250 li long. If transported by car, it can be completed within two days, avoiding delays along the way and unexpected events. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Reliable diplomatic sources state that the matter of French ratification and exchange of documents for the Sino-French Vietnam border trade agreement is not as simple as reported in the newspapers, claiming it can be announced immediately. The French side hopes that the provinces bordering Vietnam can fully and strictly implement the provisions of the trade agreement, which is fully consistent with the expectations of the central government. Once this is achieved, the French side will ratify. Previously, the French side had difficulties with issues concerning the Yunnan customs and the Longzhou area. Recently, because the Yunnan provincial government has replied by telegram to cease additional taxes, and the Longzhou issue has also been addressed through memoranda agreed upon by Chinese and French authorities, the French ambassador to China has come to Nanjing, willing to continue negotiations to finalize the agreement. He has already spoken with the Foreign Minister twice in recent days, with great cordiality. Regarding issues such as tax rate endorsements, the French ambassador has relayed them to the Paris government. Our country's desired reciprocal Vietnamese tax rates have also been conveyed to the French government by the French ambassador. Furthermore, the government has telegraphed the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan provincial governments, as well as Zhu Zhaoxin, instructing them to thoroughly report on the details of the French ambassador's visit to Nanjing, including the types of goods and tax reduction components. Negotiations with the French ambassador will resume upon receipt of their replies. It is estimated that this back-and-forth process will take at least one or two months before a complete resolution can be reached. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<p>行　行 The Jinsha River as the Boundary Between the Defensive Zones of Both Sides</p>
<p>行　行 (Nanjing) According to information from the Dalai Lama's representative office in Nanjing, the Dalai Lama highly respects the intentions of the central government. Therefore, on the 6th, he telegraphed Qong Rang Dai Ben, his representative in Kang, to exchange peace proposals with the Kang army. On the 8th, Deng Panchun, the brigade commander of the Kang army, and Qong Rang Dai Ben, the Tibetan representative, signed the peace agreement. The defensive zones of both sides will be demarcated by the Jinsha River, and neither side shall encroach upon the other. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>行　行 (Nanjing) Dalai Lama's representative, Mai Que Zhongni, stated that the Dalai Lama telegraphed him last month, expressing strong support for the Kang-Tibetan peace conference. However, due to inconvenient transportation in Tibet, it takes more than twenty days for central government telegrams to reach Lhasa, Tibet. As the matter is of great importance, it must be decided by a general assembly of the three major monasteries and the Tibetan people before being implemented by the Dalai Lama. Therefore, there is some delay. It is not that the Dalai Lama does not desire peace. The Dalai Lama's reply is expected to arrive in Nanjing soon. Currently, there are no hostilities between Kang and Tibet. Both sides are maintaining their original defenses, awaiting resolution by the central government. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Planned to Convey News During the League of Nations Meeting</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign sources, the ambassadors to China from Britain, the United States, Germany, and Italy will soon travel together from Beiping to Nanjing. The French ambassador, Wei Lihuan, who has already arrived, will also remain in Nanjing temporarily. As a rule, ambassadors from various countries should be permanently stationed at the location of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to facilitate liaison matters and avoid unnecessary delays. The current League of Nations Administrative Council meeting will be held on the 21st of this month. At that time, news related to the Sino-Japanese issue will be reported to their respective countries by the delegations of each country in Geneva. China's responses and other circumstances should also be readily known and, where the Chinese government seeks consultation, immediately relayed to their respective governments to avoid delays. Therefore, the ambassadors unanimously believe it is necessary to come to Nanjing. As for the International Committee for discussion of Far Eastern issues, it still awaits a decision from the current League of Nations Administrative Council meeting. In principle, the members of this committee are not limited to League of Nations member states. All countries with interests in the Far East, such as the United States and Russia, will participate. Its actual effectiveness may even surpass the League of Nations Council. The central topic of discussion will be the Sino-Japanese issue as the core of the Far Eastern problem. A concrete solution to the Sino-Japanese incident will be sought during the meeting. The meeting location is expected to be Geneva, near the League of Nations headquarters. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3 id="e26">Wu Chao-shu Issues Statement in Beiping <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Arrived in Beiping purely for travel, without any mission</p>
<p>There are two types of popular movements: fundamental and symptomatic cures</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from this city, more than ten representatives from the Beiping Municipal Federation of Labor Unions, Federation of Student Unions, National Salvation Association, Postal Workers' Union, and other labor unions and organizations visited Mr. Wu Chao-shu, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, at the Beijing Hotel on the 9th. Mr. Wu personally received them, and the representatives stated their intentions: (1) Popular organizations have few opportunities to contact members of the Central Committee. Mr. Wu, as an important member of the party and the nation, enjoys great prestige. Therefore, they have come to pay their respects. (2) They request that Mr. Wu provide guidance on the direction of popular movements. (3) There are rumors that Mr. Wu's visit to the north has other purposes. Although they do not believe them, they hope that Mr. Wu will fully express the purpose of his visit to inform the public and dispel rumors. Mr. Wu's response is recorded below: "I (referring to himself) have not been to Beiping for sixteen years since Zhang Xun's restoration attempt and departure from Beiping. I am extremely pleased to have this opportunity to meet with you all in one room today. Regarding the third point you asked, I can answer it first. My visit to Beiping is purely for personal travel. At the same time, because I have been away from Beiping for quite some time, I would like to take this opportunity to inspect the political, diplomatic, and social conditions of the north for my personal research. I have absolutely no mission, no activities, and I do not represent any party in negotiations. I previously visited Baotou and Suiyuan. On my return to Beiping, I passed through Zhangjiakou and met with Mr. Feng Yuxiang once. Everything we said was concerned with patriotism and sorrow for the times, and every sentence can be made public. There was no secret conversation that could not be told to others. I heard that there is a lot of speculation and attention being paid to this, which is incomprehensible. Feng is a member of the Central Supervisory Committee. It is very common for members of the Central Supervisory Committee to meet. Regarding your inquiry about the direction of popular movements, I believe that popular movements should fundamentally start with the four words 'self-reliance and self-strengthening.' They must have a spirit of perseverance, determination, and resilience to be effective. Taking the loss of the three northeastern provinces as an example, it is not impossible to recover them. Forty-eight years before the European War, France was defeated and ceded two provinces to Germany. After the European War, they were completely restored. Poland was destroyed for about two hundred years. Now it has re-established the country and recovered its old territories. These are all historical precedents that tell us. Regarding symptomatic cures, there are two things in diplomacy that depend on the people: (1) The volunteers are sacrificing their lives in the freezing cold to fight against the Japanese army. We should do our best to support them. However, I believe that the purpose of the volunteers should not be to occupy land or seize cities. As long as they can actively operate in the northeast, Japan will have to station heavy troops in the northeast. The result will be: (A) Those in Japan who do not support the warlords' invasion policy can make further efforts. (B) Japan's finances will be in dire straits due to increased military spending. (2) Economic boycott. If the whole country can unite and persevere to the end, Japan's national income and social economy will surely go bankrupt. Now, the price of gold and yen in Japan has plummeted, and the suffering of its people has reached an extreme. I came from northern Guangdong and thought that the people of the north would be more provoked by the Japanese than the people of the south. But after observing the results, I feel that the efforts of the northerners to resist Japan seem to be less than those of the southerners, which is very strange. In short, the volunteer army is fighting to defend the country and protect the home, which is beyond reproach. As for boycotting Japanese goods, if it does not exceed the scope of the law, it is also the absolute freedom of our citizens. If our people can all respect and love themselves and do both of the above two things simultaneously and consistently, then Japan will one day automatically withdraw from the eastern provinces. Otherwise, other changes may occur in its country. This all depends on our efforts." (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang Attends and Gives Instructions</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Highway Conference held its opening ceremony at 9:00 AM on the 10th in the auditorium of the Pacification Headquarters. Chairman Chiang attended and simultaneously convened a meeting with the Administrative Inspectors of Henan and Anhui provinces, giving instructions that roughly stated: "It is easy to start anything, but difficult to succeed. The suppression of bandits is about to be completed, but there will be many more difficulties in the future. The fundamental solution to banditry is to develop transportation and organize the people. The resolutions passed at this highway conference are generally good. When the representatives return, they must strive to implement them. One person should do the work of two people, and one dollar should be used as two dollars to achieve twice the result with half the effort. In the future, the construction of highways should be faster, cheaper, and better. The special commissioners in the regions must pay special attention to examining talent and recommending virtuous and capable people." The representatives nominated Qin Fen to give a reply. After the ceremony, music was played, and the meeting was adjourned. At noon, Chiang summoned the representatives of the highway conference and the administrative commissioners of Henan and Hubei in batches at the pacification headquarters to inquire about everything. At 1:00 PM, he also received five League of Nations experts, including Ling Jingji. After the closing of the conference, the representatives from Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces were scheduled to inspect the highways in Hunan on the 11th. Qin Fen and the representatives from Henan, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces returned to their respective provinces separately. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>One Person Shot and Killed</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Yesterday afternoon, Zeng Wenqing, the owner of the Chu Heng Tang paper store on Tai Tan Wei Street, was paraded through the streets by Zhao Guokang and others because of grudges over confiscated paper. They were stopped by the local police station on Xiahang Street, and Zhao Guokang and six others were detained and sent to the Public Security Bureau. According to the bureau, Zhao and others were falsely posing as members of the Eliminate Inferior Elements Association, daring to disobey and assault the police, and calling for a strike, engaging in acts of incitement to riot, and grossly violating the law. Today at noon, several hundred people held a meeting in Nan Park, discussing demands for Zhao's release. The Public Security Bureau dispatched police to stop them. Subsequently, the crowd went to the bureau to petition and was shot dead on the spot by the police. The victim was Zheng Weixin, an elementary school teacher at Jingqing Elementary School, and five others, including Li Shuzhan, were detained. Afterwards, the Public Security Bureau issued a notice stating that rioters had gathered in Nan Park to plot a riot, disobeyed suppression, and dared to go to the bureau to cause trouble and seize the guard's gun.

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e72">[Roosevelt to Travel to Europe P] <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>国民社, London, 10th - Hui Wen Daily News this morning published that the newly elected US President Roosevelt told the newspaper's representative a few weeks ago that if elected, he intended to travel to Europe before taking office to understand the actual situation there.</p>
<p>▲Havas, London, 10th - "News Chronicle" published a statement by US President-elect Roosevelt, saying, "Before taking office, I may travel to London. In recent years, I am not very familiar with the politicians who have held power in Britain. I am very willing to establish direct relationships with key figures in British political circles to gain an understanding of modern British thought and the new spirit of Europe."</p>
<p>World Reaction</p>
<p>国民社, Geneva, 9th - The League of Nations community was very pleased to hear the news of the Democratic Party's great victory in the US election. It was said that the establishment of the League of Nations relied on the efforts of the late President Wilson. Wilson's plan for the United States to join the League of Nations seemed to have failed due to the Republican Party's grip on power. Although the United States' attitude towards the League of Nations will not change much in the future, everyone expects that President Roosevelt will not be too passive in his observations of the League of Nations and will cooperate more closely with it. Some express concern about President Hoover's military contraction plan. However, the current informal representative of the United States at the Disarmament Conference, Davis, belongs to the Democratic Party and is rumored to be the next Secretary of State. Therefore, many believe that the Democratic government's disarmament policy will not greatly reverse Hoover's policies.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 10th - Several newspapers this morning believed that Roosevelt's election was not something to be envied. The New York Sun said that Roosevelt would feel like someone holding a candle into a cave, searching for gas leaks. If Roosevelt wants to repair the wounds, he must have the special talents of a magician, politician, and field hospital instructor; otherwise, he will not be able to do his job well. The Democratic Party is currently discussing candidates for the next cabinet. Many people seem to want a woman to join the cabinet. The names of the New York State Labor Commissioner, Miss Perkins, and Mrs. Greenaway (the wife of the late copper magnate) are being mentioned.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 9th - France welcomes the victory of the US Democratic Party. The general impression in Paris is that the United States will participate in world affairs on a larger scale.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 9th - The German government spokesperson spoke very cautiously about the results of the US presidential election today but said that the American people had elected a first-rate figure to maintain the highest national honor.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Berlin, 9th - The election of Roosevelt in the United States is not considered surprising by Germans, but Hoover's utter defeat was unexpected. Germans have a good feeling towards Hoover because the debt relief plan of June 1931 was initiated by Hoover, and the Hoover administration repeatedly provided assistance to Germany. Many people regret Hoover's departure. In general, people believe that the Democratic Party's foreign policy is not as supportive of German interests as the Republican Party's. "Zhou Lan Bao" stated that the American representative Davis believed that "European peace depends on France," and this idea is the starting point for European issues. Davis's view is the opposite of Hoover's. The nationalist mouthpiece believes that the rapprochement between France and the United States on the disarmament issue is largely due to Davis's efforts. The newspaper also stated that Davis has visited London and Paris successively and is now lingering in Rome, while Berlin has no intention of visiting, with a hint of bitterness in the words. In addition, German political circles believe that after the US Democratic Party takes office, it will provide more resolute support to France's desire to link disarmament and security. As for the economic aspect, Germans have a very good impression of Roosevelt's election because the United States may reduce tariffs, which may increase the sales of German goods. The most optimistic are the grape growers in the Rhine region. These people hope that the United States will lift the ban on alcohol and purchase their accumulated wine.</p>
<p>▲Havas, London, 9th - Two things about the US election deeply concern the British people: one is the Democratic Party's Roosevelt's great victory, and the other is Hoover's congratulatory telegram to the new president. An evening newspaper stated that Hoover's attitude is no different from that of a boxer who, even in defeat, does not abandon courtesy. The newspaper also said that from the perspective of the British people, the debt due on November 5 is closely related to the US presidential election. Although the new President Roosevelt does not support the cancellation of war debts, he does not reject suggestions to amend them. Therefore, although the American representative Davis's statement in Britain only concerns the US opinion on disarmament and security issues, as soon as the British people heard of Roosevelt's election, they believed that the international situation had made progress.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 10th - The President of the Bank of Japan, Mr. Kamikata, said that the victory of the US Democratic Party is beneficial to the world because he believes that the unstable state of the United States can be eliminated, and countries such as Japan can therefore adopt clear policies on the common problem of economic decline and other international disputes. However, it is still doubtful whether the Democratic Party can greatly reduce tax rates because American manufacturers are very dissatisfied with the fierce competition from foreign goods due to the convenience of cheap currency. The President of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce, Baron Go, said that Roosevelt's election is enough to encourage the American financial community to restore all credit.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 10th - Japanese newspapers all believe that the United States can be expected to progress under the Democratic Party's administration, and US-Japan relations can be expected to improve. However, the "Hochi Shimbun," while praising Roosevelt, doubts that Roosevelt may not be able to fulfill his promises during the election campaign and save the United States from economic difficulties. It is also a question to what extent he can reduce taxes. In addition, Roosevelt never mentioned foreign policy during the election campaign, which will probably be left to the new Secretary of State to determine.</p>
<p>Impact on European War Debts</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - The payment of European war debts, such as the British debt to the United States, has not been discussed for several weeks, but now it is back in international discussions. The US debt to be paid by Britain on December 15 was originally £19.75 million, but due to the fall in the value of the pound, it will now be $27 million in US dollars. The British budget does not have provisions for the payment of this debt. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain has promised that it must first be discussed with Parliament before it can be paid. The validity of the Lausanne Reparations Agreement cannot be determined at present because this agreement is conditional on the resolution of the US war debt issue. Roosevelt's election makes this issue even less likely to have rapid and effective negotiations because Roosevelt will not be able to take office until March of next year, and the current President Hoover is customarily not allowed to take actions that bind his successor. The current government cannot discuss the war debt issue at the World Economic Conference. An attitude change will not be possible until after Roosevelt takes office. Europe is now facing either a fruitless meeting or a delay in various payments until April of next year. European figures believe that the assistance of important American figures such as Young and Davis can ultimately be beneficial to the resolution of war debts and disarmament.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 10th - British newspapers today expect that Britain will soon propose the war debt issue to the United States, hoping that President Hoover's plan to suspend payments, which will expire in December, will be extended for a long period of time to await the study of the entire issue. According to the Daily Express, Britain advocates that the debt agreements be reduced and that large international loans be raised in London, Paris, and New York at low interest rates to meet US debt. The £29 million owed to the United States, which is due on December 15, will be extended for payment with the agreement of both Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>National Assembly Election Situation</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 10th - The latest report on the number of seats won by each party in the congressional election is as follows: Senate: Democratic Party 58, Republican Party 35, Farmer-Labor Party 1, undecided 2; House of Representatives: Democratic Party 275, Republican Party 100, undecided 60.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 9th - It is now known that the number of Electoral College votes is as follows: Roosevelt 472, Hoover 59. The composition of the new Congress, as far as is known at present, is as follows: House of Representatives: Democratic Party 241, Republican Party 78, unclear 116; Senate: Democratic Party 56, Republican Party 34, Farmer-Labor Party 1, unclear 5.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 10th - Reuters learned today that the British government will soon send a note to the US government regarding the next debt payment issue. Responsible parties do not believe the saying that there will be a special plan for debt resolution, as reported in today's Daily Express, and they firmly state that Britain will not default on debt repayment. Reuters' New York correspondent reported that US newspapers are now giving special coverage to the war debt issue. The Pulpit Herald predicts that President Hoover and President-elect Roosevelt will discuss the issue when they meet. It also said that there is absolutely no clause in the Democratic Party platform that can prevent Congress from supporting President Hoover's proposal to extend the payment due on December 15 and to instruct the War Debts Committee to re-examine the ability of debtor countries to pay.</p>
<p>United States to Lift Alcohol Ban</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th - It is expected that the new US Congress will be dominated by those who oppose the alcohol ban. They will introduce a bill when they meet in December to allow the sale of beer with an alcohol content of more than 1.5%. This proposal is certain to pass.</p>
<p>▲Havas, New York, 9th - The leaders of the anti-prohibition faction are very satisfied with the results of this election because the Democratic Party's candidates promised that if they came to power, they would repeal the prohibition law and allow the sale of alcohol and beer. In this election of the House of Representatives, among the 221 elected members, 146 belong to the anti-prohibition faction. Newspapers predict that the anti-prohibition faction will definitely obtain two-thirds of the seats in the new House of Representatives and will also have the largest majority in the Senate. However, the next parliament will only make major modifications to the prohibition law and will not completely abolish it because there are still many Democrats in the southern states who advocate prohibition.</p>
<p>▲Havas, New York, 9th - In this election, the anti-prohibition faction has been elected as the majority of members, so the power of the anti-prohibition faction can control the new parliament. According to the Commercial Daily's speculation, the anti-prohibition faction will take action to amend the prohibition law before next March. This faction will submit a draft law to the parliament within this December, requesting the parliament to allow the people to sell beer containing 1.5% alcohol.</p>
<p>New York City Market Looks Good</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th - After the election results were announced, the stock prices on Wall Street rose sharply today. The prices of important securities rose from 25 cents to nearly two dollars. Buying sentiment was very strong at the opening, but later, due to many sellers, most of the increased prices were lost at the close.</p>
<p>▲Havas, New York, 9th - The circulation of gold dollars in the market has increased again in recent months, which is clear evidence of the stability of people's minds. During the panic period last spring, hundreds of people rented safe deposit boxes from banks to store cash. This gold dollar has gradually circulated in the market. According to banking circles, the phenomenon that the public asked banks to pay gold dollars at the beginning of this year has almost completely stopped.</p>
<p>Japan's Unprecedented Budget</p>
<p>Totaling 2.23 Billion Yen</p>
<p>Public Debt Issuance Breaks 1.1 Billion</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 10th - The army and navy authorities are fiercely competing for the allocation of the 95 million yen that the Minister of Finance has agreed to add to the budget. Finally, it was agreed that the army would receive 50 million yen and the navy would receive 45 million yen. With this increase, the total amount of the next budget will reach 2,205,000,000 yen, of which 447,000,000 yen belongs to the Ministry of the Army and 372,000,000 yen belongs to the Ministry of the Navy. The original request of the Ministry of the Army was 561,000,000 yen, and the Ministry of the Navy was 614,000,000 yen. After Takahashi made this concession, it is estimated that there is still a shortage of 900,000,000 yen, which will be made up by issuing public debt.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 10th - The contentious budget for the next year was successfully resolved because Finance Minister Takahashi acknowledged the amount of 22 million yen for the revival requests of various provinces, 10 million yen for the Manchurian Incident reserve fund of the army and navy, and 90 million yen for the second supplementary plan fee for the improvement of military equipment. The total amount of the above-mentioned approved revival requests reached 122 million yen. Adding the previously approved amount, the total amount of new requests approved for the next year reached 732 million yen. Therefore, the total amount of the general accounting budget for the next year increased from 2,105 million yen in the proposed budget cabinet meeting to 2,230 million yen this time, which is an unprecedentedly large budget. As a result, the amount of public debt issued will be 890 million yen. If the planned amount of special accounting public debt issuance of 113 million yen is added, it will break 1 billion yen. If the public debt delivered by the general and special accounting is added, it will definitely be above 1.1 billion yen.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 10th - Regarding the amount of the Ministry of Finance's approval of the revival requests for the next year's budget, the amount for each province other than the army and navy was 20 million yen in yesterday's cabinet meeting. The Budget Bureau drafted a verification plan again today and will hold a provincial meeting on the 11th to decide on the allocation method of 20 million yen to each province.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 10th - The revival requests of the army and navy were decided in yesterday's cabinet meeting to be supplemented by issuing 90 million yen in public debt. The allocation method will be directly negotiated by the two provinces. Therefore, the army's Ono Tera and the navy's Kato, the two directors of the Finance Bureau, started negotiations yesterday afternoon based on the intentions of their respective headquarters. The army insisted on 70 million yen for the army and 20 million yen for the navy, refusing to concede, which was quite different from the navy's claims. The navy refused to recognize the army's claims, and the attitude was quite tough, so the meeting ended without results. It was decided to continue the inter-provincial negotiation meeting today. On the other hand, the navy held a headquarters meeting at 10 o'clock last night and discussed until late at night before dispersing.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 10th - Secretary-General Shibata visited Prime Minister Saito at 6:30 this morning to discuss the revival requests of the army and navy. After the discussion, he summoned Vice Ministers Yanagita and Fujita of the army and navy to the Secretary-General's official residence at 7:40, and then summoned Vice Minister Kuroda of the Ministry of Finance at 9:30 to join the consultation. As a result, an additional 5 million yen was added, and the allocation was directly negotiated by the army and navy. As a result, it was decided to use 95 million yen for the army's military equipment improvement fee, and 45 million yen for the navy. The navy gathered Navy Minister Okada and other leaders at the Navy Minister's official residence, and Vice Minister Fujita reported the details of the above decision. Although it was felt that it was still not sufficient after the consultation, it was deeply understood that the army had made concessions at this juncture, so the decision was made to approve the allocation. Navy Minister Okada visited Finance Minister Takahashi at 10:30 am and reported the approval. The army also gathered at 11 am, and Vice Minister Yanagita, Director of the Finance Bureau Ono Tera, and Chief of the Accounting Section Ouchi, etc., discussed the amount of revival allocation. As a result, the main purpose was to avoid disputes from the perspective of the overall national situation, and the allocation amount was officially approved and telegraphed to Army Minister Araki in Osaka.</p>

He nodded to important ministers such as Yamamoto, the Grand Order of Merit, and Kuratomi, the President of the Privy Council, who were lined up on the platform to see him off.

<p>Important News: Liu Xiang's Attack on Luzhou is Intensifying</p>
<p>One Warship Destroyed, Aircraft Continue Bombing</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in Neijiang and Fushun, Outcome Undecided</p>
<p>Will Not Accept Mediation from Any Party Before Victory</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The war in Sichuan, due to the coordination of Deng, Tian, and Liu, was once calm, but now it is becoming more intense. Liu Xiang's troops attacking Luzhou include Mu Yingzhou, Liao Haitao, Xu Yaoqing, and He Chunwu, etc., supplemented by two aviation and gunboat teams, with strong strength. On the morning of the 7th, Mu's troops advanced to Xiaoshi on the south bank of the Tuo River and fired across the river at Liu Wenhui's troops. Liao, Xu, He and other troops, under the cover of two warships, launched a fierce attack on the city. The provincial army responding to the battle was the 7th Mixed Brigade of the 2nd Division of the 24th Army, led by Tian Jizhong, and the 9th Mixed Brigade of the 3rd Division, led by Yang Shangzhou, who counterattacked in separate ways. One of the Chongqing army's warships was hit by the provincial army's artillery, and the ship was tilted and retreated in embarrassment. One of the ships then covered the army's temporary retreat, and the battle stopped for several hours. In the afternoon, there were local wars on both sides, with no major victories or defeats. On the morning of the 8th, the Chongqing army, with one warship and several aircraft, covered the various troops and attacked the city again. However, due to the dangerous terrain, they failed to capture it. At the same time, the fighting in Neijiang and Fushun was also fierce. In Neijiang, Tang Shizun's division was the vanguard, and they came into contact with the provincial army in Baimu Town. Wang Zhiyi's troops, about three regiments, faced off across the river with the provincial army in Dongjiezhi, near Neijiang, and are still in a stalemate. In Fushun, fierce fighting between the two sides took place in Gaoshikan. From the 7th to the 8th, the outcome was undecided. Liu Xiang, eager to capture Luzhou, is rushing troops to join the front line. The Training Division's Yang Guozhen Brigade and the Model Division's 1st and 2nd Brigades are all led by Pan Wenhua and are moving towards Neijiang. The tank unit is also rushing to the front. It is expected that there will be a bloody battle in the coming days. Liu Xiang's planned plan is to first capture Luzhou, take Fushun, and then launch a fierce attack on Zinei. Therefore, the most intense fighting in various places is in Luzhou, followed by Fushun and Neijiang. Liu's attempt to capture Luzhou has two purposes: (1) to seize the rich resources of Jiading, Xufu, and Ziliujing and force the 24th Army into Kang; (2) to use force to coerce Deng, Tian, Liu, Yang and others to unify the entire province. Therefore, at this time when the war is in full swing, he will not accept mediation from any party. Even the Central Government's order to cease fire cannot be followed immediately. According to Pan Wenhua, a division commander of the Chongqing army, Liu's view on Liu Wenhui's telegram to Jiang, demanding the return of military and political power to the Central Government and the implementation of demobilization, is inconsistent with the principles of the Suining Conference. Sichuan affairs should be decided by the people of Sichuan themselves, and the Central Government is too busy and may not have time to deal with it. These few words are enough to reveal Liu Xiang's intentions. Liu Wenhui's troops have modeled their organization and training on the Ma Chang training system, and their equipment is the latest, which is enough to compete with the Chongqing army, but they lack aircraft, warships, and tanks. Although the Chongqing army is advancing on three fronts: sea, land, and air, there are only three warships, all of which have been transformed from merchant ships. Their combat effectiveness is very weak, and it is as if they do not exist. One ship was sunk in Jiangjin, and one ship was destroyed in Luzhou River. Now there is only one ship left, which is useless. The air power is greater, and the provincial army is extremely afraid. Liu Wenhui has issued air defense measures to inform the soldiers of where to avoid, so the losses are still light. However, the general public has been killed and injured by the random bombing of the air force, which has aroused public resentment. Liu Wenhui took this opportunity to publicize the Chongqing army's warmongering and encouraged the soldiers to defend Luzhou to maintain their lifeline, and when the Chongqing army slackened, they would launch a full-scale counterattack. As for Deng Tian's attitude, it has recently become clearer, with Deng being more resolute than Tian. Deng's troops have now moved from Ziyang to Zizhong, closer to the front line. If they join the vortex, the expansion and prolongation of the war will be inevitable. Zhang Qun, a Sichuanese member of the Central Committee, came to Hankou to meet with Jiang to resolve the Sichuan affairs. He had consulted with the representatives of the various armies stationed in Hankou and decided that each representative would telegram each army commander to cease fire before the 21st and await resolution. As of the 9th, none of the representatives had received a reply telegram. Zhang met with Chairman Jiang on the 8th, but Jiang had just returned from a long journey and had not yet discussed it. He will discuss it in detail with Jiang in the coming days to determine a solution. Zhang told this newspaper's reporter on the 9th that the war has been launched for a long time and it is difficult to resolve it immediately. At present, we should try to prevent it from expanding or prolonging, and then try to clean up. As for the plan to permanently establish the Sichuan situation, we should first find the source of the chaos in Sichuan. If military, political, and financial affairs cannot be unified, they will all be a source of chaos and should be thoroughly reorganized. The decree issued by the National Government in the 17th year of the Republic of China is indeed the fundamental plan for governing Sichuan and can still be applied. He is currently studying how to implement it and will discuss it in detail with Chairman Jiang so that it can proceed smoothly. (November 9)</p>
<p>Harbin Japanese Implement Two Kinds of Poisonous Policies</p>
<p>Massive Gambling and Open Sale of Opium</p>
<p>Abuse Chinese and Cheat Everywhere</p>
<p>Manzhouli Correspondence: Under the control of the Japanese, the puppet state is now implementing two kinds of poisonous policies. One is to issue lottery tickets in the name of rescuing the flood in northern Manchuria, with drawings every half month, forcing local merchants to sell them on commission, and not giving them any benefits. The first prize is a fixed bonus of 20,000 yuan, and the second prize is 5,000 yuan. The Japanese hold these lottery tickets and sell them door-to-door to the Chinese. Under the weight of their power, the Chinese do not dare not buy them. The other is opium monopoly, which will be implemented on November 15. Official opium bureaus will be established everywhere to purchase opium produced in various places, which will be monopolized by the official opium bureau. The opium-producing areas will be divided into four regions: A, B, C, and D. The official price of opium containing 80% pure opium is 2 yuan per ounce, the official price of opium containing 60% pure opium is 1.6 yuan, the official price of opium containing 50% pure opium is 1.2 yuan, and the official price of opium containing 40% pure opium is 8 cents. If private transactions are found, the opium will be confiscated and a fine will be added. After purchasing the opium, the official opium bureau will then affix a stamp to each package and sell it to the outside. Opium with a stamp is not illegal to smoke at any time or place. However, smokers must also obtain a smoking license according to the opium level, ranging from 50 yuan to 200 yuan per month. Opium public sales points set up by Japanese and Koreans are not subject to fees, while those set up by Chinese must pay donations in two categories, A and B, ranging from 200 yuan to 400 yuan per month. Currently, opium dens set up by Japanese and Koreans are everywhere in Shen</p>

<p>Business News, Financial Markets, and Gold Prices Soar</p>
<p>A Surge of Twelve Taels and Nine Mace</p>
<p>Yesterday, Thursday, coinciding with the Western merchants' autumn horse racing, the gold market saw a full day of trading. The market showed a sudden bullish trend, breaking through the 740 to 750 tael levels. However, the buying power was limited, with only about two taels per transaction. The overall market saw a rebound of seven taels and seven mace, ultimately surging by twelve taels and nine mace. The speed of this rise was unexpected. The initial surge was attributed to a decline in silver prices, as well as the drop in silver futures and American cotton on the silver exchange. This fueled bullish sentiment. While foreign exchange rates also trended upwards, they fluctuated slightly between 46 and 47 taels. The outlook for exchange rates improved, with major players actively buying and short sellers rushing to cover their positions. The market further strengthened, reaching 51 taels and eight mace. However, as sellers became more active, the price retreated to the 50-tael mark. There were no new developments from abroad. Previously, in November, short seller Ruikang transferred 70 contracts to Tongfengheng, posting a premium of 1.5 to 1 tael. A detailed account of the market's movements is provided below.</p>
<p>Morning Opening Jumps Eight Taels and Two Mace</p>
<p>From the early opening of the December contract, the price surged eight taels and two mace to 745 taels. Despite the large volume, there was no change in direction. The decline in American silver led to a higher opening price. (Before the market opened, the black market price was 41 to 42 taels, then slightly above 4 taels.) Due to sales by Wupin and Ruixing, the price retreated to 4 taels and one mace. Subsequently, Yifengyong, Zhaofengchang, Hengyu, Yuankangxiang, Zhifengyong, Daxingyong, Xiexingyong, and other scattered short positions aggressively entered the market. Additionally, the contraction of American dollars in January led brokers to bid 0.9375 for January and 0.0625 for February, causing the price to rise by more than three taels to seven taels and six mace. At this time, Yuanmaoyong, Hengyu, Zhifengyong, Yuanchun, Wupin, and others sold. Huabi offered February American dollars at 0.0625 and this month's British pounds at 1.96875, a discount of about two taels, at 5 taels and eight mace. Later, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, Futaiheng, and Yuantai bought in. HSBC's listed price contracted by half a point, with British pounds at 1.25 and American dollars at 0.25, resulting in a price of seven taels and two mace at 9:30 AM. The February contract was traded at 30 yuan. Shortly after, Hengxing sold on behalf of a client, and Yuanmaoyong, Yuanheng, and Dadecheng also sold. Huabi sold November American dollars at 0.875 to Xingye, causing the gold price to fall back by two taels, to 5 taels and three mace after 11:00 AM.

<p>丨Active Domestic Transactions丨</p>

<p>Foreign Interest at 7 Mace and 1 Fen</p>
<p>This week, due to the Western merchants' horse racing, foreign banks closed in the afternoon as usual. Therefore, the morning market situation was slightly better for the past few days, and the afternoon market was completely stagnant. Although most money shops and Chinese banks operated as usual, the exchange and large transactions inevitably paled in comparison. The situation fully recovered yesterday, so the banking sector's business, whether in settlements or trading, was much better than in the past. As a result, the foreign interest rate rose, while silver discounts softened.</p>
<p>▲ New Price for Foreign Interest, Discounts Weaker</p>
<p>(Foreign Interest) Although the foreign interest rate in the morning market was slightly better than the previous afternoon, at 7 hao and 5 li, it was only 7 mace and 1 fen. The new high price was found, and the afternoon market returned 1 hao and 2 hu, to 7 mace, 0 fen, 9 li, 8 hao, and 7.5 hu. As a result, the total increase between the two markets was 6 hao and 2.5 hu. (Silver Discounts) Both the morning and afternoon markets were the same at 3 fen, a sharp decrease of half compared to the previous day, a total of 3 fen. Even with settlement and additional fees, it was still only 2-3 fen. The silver market was very relaxed.</p>
<p>▲ Small Silver Coins Continued to Contract Sharply</p>
<p>Jiangnan small silver coins were the same in the morning and afternoon markets, at 6 mace, 1 fen, and 5 li, an increase of 3 li compared to the previous day. 6,500 jiao were traded in the morning and 2,500 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver coins were also the same in the morning and afternoon markets, at 6 mace, 0 fen, and 7.5 hao, also the same as the previous afternoon. 115,000 jiao were traded in the morning and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon. Due to the limited supply and high demand, copper coins contracted sharply by 3,000 wen per day, to 406,000 wen. 37,300 strings of wen were traded.</p>
<p>▲ Frequent Silver and Foreign Currency Settlements</p>
<p>(Silver) Yesterday, after the banks opened, there were many settlements. Chinese merchants settled over 3.1 million in tickets, foreign merchants settled over 2.9 million in tickets, 1.2 million in telegraphic transfers, 1.4 million in advances, 2.67 million in special funds, and 1.5 million in pledged transactions. Various goods, exchange rates, taxes, and other fees amounted to over 11 million. 1.3 million was withdrawn from warehouses. Due to the better prices, money shops and silver companies settled over 38 million in individual transactions, 5.3 million in settlement fees, over 900,000 in remittances from various routes, and over 1 million in cash. (Foreign Currency) 1.125 million was made in morning market drafts, 90,000 in banknotes, 135,000 in foreign banknotes, and 45,000 in check transactions. In the afternoon market, 565,000 was made in drafts, 20,000 in banknotes, 50,000 in foreign banknotes, and 35,000 in checks. Banks traded 1.2 million with each other in the morning and 500,000 in the afternoon. Additionally, over 1 million was made separately. Foreign currency transactions between banks amounted to over 2.2 million. 2.45 million in banknotes were recovered and issued. Money shops and foreign currency companies settled over 8.9 million in individual transactions, 2.8 million in settlement fees, 1.9 million in foreign currency loans, 900,000 in foreign currency pledge transactions, 1.2 million from clients' settlements, and 800,000 in small money shop transactions. The Stock and Bond Market Also Reacted Sharply</p>
<p>丨Sharp Price Fluctuations, Lively Market丨</p>
<p>丨Uniform Salt Tax Sharply Reduced by Two Yuan and Several Jiao丨</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 10th), the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a more active futures market than the previous day. Market prices fluctuated sharply. Both sides were very bullish. The volume of buying and selling was significant, and the market was as good as in the past. Only a few spot transactions were opened, and there were not many deals. Prices had been rising significantly for several days. For example, the troop reduction bonds had risen by 10 yuan compared to before. Other bonds also saw gains of about 6-8 yuan. Although there was no significant progress in the overall situation, buying interest gradually increased, and market sentiment improved. In reality, the price fluctuations were due to daily increases, not to any clear improvement in the overall situation. Yesterday morning, selling interest was active, but the market was still peaceful at that time. Subsequently, selling transactions became more active, and one side sold heavily. As a result, the supply and demand situation gradually diverged, and all prices fell rapidly. Although the afternoon opening saw a slight rebound, the market fell sharply again at the close. As a result, the uniform salt tax fell by two yuan and several jiao. Most other bonds fell by eight or nine jiao to 1.5-6 yuan. It was generally believed that the future of the bond market would remain weak. However, there were many rumors in the market at the moment, and the situation was chaotic, making it difficult to predict. The volume of futures trading was 8.25 million in the morning and 7.2 million in the afternoon, totaling 15.455 million yuan. Spot trading totaled 15,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cloth Market Suddenly Weakens</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market suddenly fell, and the situation weakened again. The decline in American cotton scattered the previous day's bullish momentum. The market environment worsened, and the actual demand became more sluggish, leading to further declines in market sentiment. The market fell by two points, but the Rongxing bulls remained unmoved. In short, the current yarn sales market is too narrow, and there is no fundamental upward momentum. Fortunately, the base is already exhausted, and a sharp decline is unlikely to occur in the short term. The situation remains weak.</p>
<p>Human Bidding Retreats by Two Points</p>
<p>The Human Bidding market opened on the previous morning. Due to the further decline in American cotton, buyers were disappointed, and the market weakened again. Each month fell by 1.2.3.4 qian. In the afternoon, the market was bleak and dull, with a slight increase of 1 qian. Total trading volume for the day was 26,600 bales. Shenxin sold 1,200 bales, Gengfeng 850 bales, Senkang 600 bales, Shenji 1,200 bales, Renfeng 1,200 bales, and Tongxing 950 bales. Tonghe 600 bales. Delong bought 1,100 bales, Yichang 850 bales, Yiyu 1,050 bales, Tongyu 800 bales, Xincheng 2,150 bales, and Dafu 850 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>▲ Current Yarn Sales Sluggish, Following the Decline</p>
<p>Current sales were quite sluggish. According to statistics, various groups bought only 254 bales for the whole day. Prices fell by 2.5 to 5 qian. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Mainland 137 Zhenjiang 5 Shantou 5</p>
<p>Guangdong 7 Luzhou 85 Xuzhou 15</p>
<p>Cotton Market Decline Resumes</p>
<p>The US cotton estimate released by the government increased by a large 522,000 bales. The market price fell. The bullish momentum of the previous day was suddenly scattered, causing great disappointment to buyers. Retail investors generally saw the poor market prospects and settled some of their holdings. However, it was heard that prices in the producing areas were difficult to loosen, so even though the market fell, there was a shortage of hedgers. In addition, the price of gold rose, and the market was still tight. However, most people expect the US cotton market to hold the 6-cent mark, but this time they fear that it will be difficult to maintain. If it falls within the mark, there may be a weak momentum in this cotton market.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Bidding Market Buys Less, Market Soft</p>
<p>The Zheng Bidding market opened in the previous market. Due to the decline in US cotton, there was a lack of Yangzhong buyers, and the market atmosphere softened. Each month fell by 5-6 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the price of gold rose, and the market situation was slightly stronger. Each month rose by 5 fen to 2 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 84,200 dan. Mingde sold 2,200 dan, Jifeng 2,500 dan, Shenji 2,400 dan, Yuchang 2,300 dan, and Gengfeng 9,100 dan. Hengde bought 4,500 dan, Yiyu 2,900 dan, Yuanda 3,000 dan, Changfeng 1,500 dan, and Huachang 1,600 dan. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

Yihua Factory bought 2,000 bales of cargo, currently being sent to the factory. Tongzhou cotton 31.50. Minfeng Factory bought 1,100 bales. Also, US and UK cotton declined uniformly.</p>
<p>丨Indian Cotton Slight Increase丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton initially weakened due to government reports favoring short positions and long positions settling, and later rebounded due to some covering of short positions. Futures fell by 16 to 20 pounds and current prices fell by 15 pounds. UK cotton futures fell by 212 points, and current prices remained unchanged. Egyptian cotton current prices fell by 1 point. Indian cotton was bought by European exporters, and the market was stable. Phalgur rose by 3 rupees, and Ormla and Bai Luoxi also rose by 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left.

<p>Yesterday, over 40 boats arrived in Shanghai South, and the amount in storage in the port gradually increased to over 200 boats. Both urban and rural areas had abundant supplies, and the market was sluggish, making people feel more relaxed and less stressed. Changxi and Tongxi merchants were also short on funds. The prices of early and late rice were generally weak.</p>
<p>▲ Source of New Zhazha Yesterday Was 40 to 50 Boats</p>
<p>The route to this street is becoming increasingly sluggish. Yin Yuan wine merchants are not active, and prices are down by 3 jiao. Zhongguan Hou Geng is also short on funds. The customer help for Bo Dao is slightly responsive. The opening is set, and the arrival of Du Bu Jian is selling steadily, but the momentum is often weak. Hunan also has 4,000 new arrivals.</p>
<p>丨North and South Customer Assistance Stalled丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign customers were all stuck in a sluggish situation. Foreign rice has been held for a long time, and recently some insiders have self-allocated, and the bottom storage is gradually decreasing. The owners are more determined in their thinking. After the local market price rebounded slightly, the customers intend to hold small and then handle. And recently, the source of customer rice is increasing every day, and the market has the necessity of leveling off. Although customers have appetite, they also mainly watch and see. Yesterday, two new boats of Hunan rice arrived, which were loaded by Jihe Hongyuan, with a total of about 4,000 packages, mainly oil rice, with only a small number of machine and Yuan rice. The production price in that place is flat and falling, which can be combined to come to Shanghai, but the customer is currently watching and seeing, and the future market is not optimistic. The flour market was slightly brisk for a while.</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month showed a trend of initial decline followed by stability. Foreign wheat quotations continued to be 2-3-4 jiao lower, and the world's sluggish prices could not be restored for a while. Therefore, although people's hearts were soft, they were 1 fen lower than the previous day. After the second market, because there were not many sellers, the factory slightly resisted the entry for the current month, and the long-term also stabilized due to the customer resisting short, only about 0.5 li smaller. When forced to open in the afternoon, the market atmosphere was quite prosperous, because the price of gold soared by more than ten taels, and people's hearts were driven. However, off-site customers were watching and unwilling to move forward, and buying interest was very weak, so there was little increase. After entering, I heard that Fuxin sold out, and the market atmosphere turned lax. The Australian wheat at 3 li, 4 qian, and 8 fen heard that another batch of foreign wheat was sold. If the continued stability does not stop, the future will continue to be long-term fatigue and short-term prosperity. As a result, the current month was 1 fen and 2 li and a half better than the previous day, December was 5 li better, January was 7 li and a half better, February was 2 li and a half better, and March was unchanged, etc. The wheat market was quiet and stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, was generally calm, slightly showing a stable image. Initially, foreign wheat quotations continued to fall by 2-3-4 jiao, and people's hearts were flat, but there were limited real sellers, and the market also stabilized once the sellers were few. When it came to the opening in the afternoon, the transaction was still light, but the transaction in February and March was still strong, and due to the slight briskness of the flour market, people's hearts were also brought up, but there was not much ups and downs. According to the intention of people in the industry, foreign wheat and wharf sets must be entered before they can be colorful. As a result, February was 2 fen better, March was 1 fen better, and the rest had no ups and downs. Chicago wheat continued to decline.</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company Report: On Wednesday (the 9th), the Chicago wheat market situation was affected by the stock market crash, and prices also weakened due to slight sales in the East. The total transaction volume for the day was 30 million bushels. The market conditions on the 9th are also listed on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Theft Case Cracked at Nantong Museum <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>First Thief Arrested at Nantong Rengang</p>
<p>Stolen Goods Recovered in Shanghai within Three Hours of Arrival</p>
<p>The Nantong Museum, founded by Mr. Zhang Jian, is the earliest and largest museum in China. The exhibits within were painstakingly collected by Mr. Zhang during his time in Japan. Initially, it served as a reference and research tool for students of normal, agricultural, and other schools. Over the past twenty years, its content has been enriched and its scale has grown. After the Nantong University Board of Directors was established in 1929, when Zhang Xiaoruo transferred the university's assets to the board, it was decided in a meeting that the museum and library should fall under the university's purview. Director Zhang Xiaoruo appointed Sun Zitie, the museum's director, to be responsible for its safekeeping. Management was stringent, and no thefts had occurred. However, on the afternoon of November 6th of this year, when lawyer Shao Zhi and his family visited, accompanied by staff member Ge Jinfu to the south building, they found the door locked as usual. Upon entering, they discovered that over eighty valuable ancient bronze, stone, jade, porcelain, and carved items were missing from the east and west rooms. Director Sun, who was at home due to his mother's critical illness, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. After confirming the losses, he immediately reported to the police for investigation and pursuit. He also telegraphed Director Zhang Xiaoruo, who replied, stating that the theft of public property was a serious matter and that he should immediately consult with board member Xu Gengqi and the department heads in Nantong to request a thorough investigation from the county bureau and swift handling of the matter. The Nantong police, recognizing the case as theft of public property, immediately ordered officers to search the area and inspect travelers at the exits. That evening, they intercepted a thief involved in the theft from the home of university board member Xu Gengqi in Rengang. The thief confessed that the museum theft was committed by his accomplice Zhao De, who was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Haimen by boat and meet them at the Yuebao Inn in the South City. Zhang Xiaoruo in Shanghai received the telegram and promptly notified board members Wu Jichen and Shen Yanmou in Shanghai on the night of the 8th at 2:00 AM. They entrusted Wang Yinqiao and Yang Qingbang to deliver the telegram to the district chief of the South City Public Security Bureau, who dispatched patrol officer Guo Jifen and police chief Pang Zilin to search the Yuebao Inn without success. They then searched nearby inns, finally capturing four suspects—Hu Zixiang, Chen Jinbiao, Zhou Jinquan, and Chen Xie—at the Nankang Inn. All stolen goods were recovered intact. The bandits had transported the stolen goods from Hai to Shanghai and were apprehended within three hours of their arrival. The ringleader was still asleep, and an accomplice had left to make external contacts but had not yet returned. If the thief in Rengang had not been apprehended first and the telegram had been delayed by two or three hours, the stolen goods would have been moved, sold, or dispersed, making recovery difficult. The urgency of the situation was extreme. On the 9th, representatives of the university board of directors claimed the stolen goods. Zhang Xiaoruo, Wu, and Shen dispatched responsible personnel to transport them back to the museum for display. The entire process was reported to board chairmen Chu Minyi and He Yushu. The ringleaders have been severely punished by the Public Security Bureau according to the law.</p>
<p>Nephews Accuse Paternal Uncle of Embezzling Public Property</p>
<p>Estimated at Over 67,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Judge Hopes for Reconciliation Between Uncle and Nephews</p>
<p>Xu Yucheng, a descendant of a former Qing official, from Haiyan, Zhejiang, residing at 14 Xingapore Road, was previously sued in the First Special District Court by his nephews Xu Wenrong and Xu Wenxin, represented by lawyers Yan E'sen and Zhong Hongsheng, on charges of embezzling public property. The court had previously interrogated the involved parties, as reported in this newspaper. After the plaintiffs meticulously examined the account books during the postponement, they discovered numerous instances of embezzlement, estimated at over 67,000 yuan. Consequently, their lawyers submitted a supplemental complaint to the court, detailing the specific instances of embezzlement. Yesterday afternoon, judge Huang Risheng reopened the case for trial in the Ninth Tribunal. The defendant, Xu Yucheng, along with his lawyers Yang Linzhi and Ye Shaoying, appeared in court. The plaintiffs, Xu Wenrong, claimed that they filed the lawsuit due to the defendant's suspected embezzlement while managing public property. They stated that their father had three brothers: the eldest being their deceased father, the second being the defendant Xu Yucheng, and the youngest being their third uncle, Xu Shiheng. During the family division in the 31st year of the Guangxu era, the estate was divided into four portions: one each for their father and two uncles, and the remaining portion designated as public property, which no one could claim for division. At that time, the plaintiffs were only sixteen years old, so the public property was entrusted to the defendant for management, consisting of 1,600 mu of rice fields and over 20,000 yuan in cash, totaling over 80,000 yuan. Around the ninth month of the 32nd year of the Guangxu era, the second uncle, Xu Yucheng, took office in Beiping, and the public property was handed over to the third uncle for management. When the third uncle passed away in the second year of the Xuantong era, the second uncle returned home and continued to manage the public property. However, interest from the accounts was never distributed, and they were never informed about the account books. Upon requesting the defendant to turn over the accounts, which was refused, they filed a lawsuit in the civil court. After the defendant submitted the account books, they were copied and scrutinized, revealing numerous instances of embezzlement, leading to the submission of various copied accounts and specific claims of embezzlement, such as several thousand yuan suspected in the Dingsheng pawnshop. Judge Huang then presented the account books to the defendant for review. The defendant claimed that the public property, including movable and immovable assets, was indeed over 80,000 yuan at the time, and was managed by him. However, after their late mother's passing, all expenses for funerals and other related matters were charged to the public property account. All account books from the 31st year of the Guangxu era to the 20th year of the Republic of China had been submitted to the court, except for three years, which were kept by his third brother, Xu Shiheng. The defendant claimed that he was unable to respond to the plaintiffs' embezzlement allegations immediately, as the family property was managed by his uncle, and he needed to investigate at home before providing a detailed response. At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Yang Linzhi, rose to argue that all the defendant's account books had been submitted to the court, but three account books from the 32nd year of the Guangxu era to the first year of the Republic of China had been taken by the plaintiffs and should be returned for verification. Furthermore, the plaintiffs' complaint listed several dozen instances of embezzlement, totaling tens of thousands of yuan, spanning over twenty years. The defendant had only just received the supplemental complaint and had no opportunity to study it in detail. An adjournment was requested to allow for a thorough examination and listing of the accounts in a supplemental defense, which would facilitate the trial. Judge Huang, upon review, noted that both parties were prominent merchants and close relatives (uncle and nephews), and questioned why they were resorting to such extreme measures in court. He suggested they attempt reconciliation outside of court, with both parties' lawyers and principals jointly submitting the account books for impartial verification. The case was postponed for two weeks, and both parties expressed agreement, showing remorse and agreeing to comply.</p>
<p>Completion Ceremony for Yang-Sculpted Arhats</p>
<p>The Yang-sculpted Arhats at Baosheng Temple in Jiaozhi Town, Kunshan, have been repaired and preserved through the joint initiative of prominent figures in the Party and state.

Prominent figures such as Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfo, and Wu Zhihui are expected to attend the ceremony in Jiaozhi. The railway bureau has prepared a special train for Cai and others to travel on, and Chen Henian and Ruan Guorui have been appointed to host them in Kunshan. They will take the early express train from Beijing-Shanghai to Kunshan at 7:00 AM, transfer to a special ferry to Jiaozhi at 9:00 AM, and arrive there at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Red Cross Hospital Subsidy Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The China Red Cross General Hospital receives an annual subsidy of 2,000 taels from the Municipal Council. Recently, the hospital requested an increase due to its increased workload. The Finance Committee discussed the matter, and the Director of Public Health expressed sympathy for the request. However, the hospital is located in the French Concession on Rue de la Sœur, and the Finance Director reported that the hospital's financial situation was satisfactory. Upon checking the accounts, it was found that the French Concession did not provide subsidies. Considering these factors, the committee decided to recommend maintaining the hospital's subsidy at 2,000 taels for the year 1933. This proposal has been adopted by the Board of Directors on the 10th.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Subsidizes Salvation Army</p>
<p>To Assist Ex-Prisoners</p>
<p>The Shanghai Salvation Army recently reported to the Shanghai Municipal Council on its work and accounts for assisting ex-prisoners from July of last year to June of this year. The Finance Committee reviewed the report during its previous meeting. The Acting Finance Director stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council had previously approved an annual allocation of 5,000 yuan for this assistance program. The Salvation Army, after taking over the program in July of last year, did not request this subsidy. A review of the accounts revealed that the Salvation Army incurred a deficit of 581.53 yuan last year, which the Shanghai Municipal Council should reimburse, and a subsidy of 5,000 yuan should be provided for this year. After deliberation, the committee concluded that the Salvation Army's work had been outstanding and that the reimbursement of last year's deficit and the allocation of this year's subsidy should be approved. This proposal has been adopted by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Qiu Xin Factory Dispute Resolved</p>
<p>Laid-Off Workers Receive Severance Pay</p>
<p>The Qiu Xin Shipbuilding Factory in the South City military camp recently experienced a dispute due to the dismissal of 32 workers, including Zhao Rixin. Negotiations by Party and government representatives were unsuccessful. The dismissed workers surrounded the factory's supervisor, Mike Diroli, demanding severance pay. Concerned about the potential escalation of the labor dispute, the Municipal Party Committee representative Dai Yongchan and the Social Affairs Bureau representative Wang Xianqing met with supervisor Mac Diroli at the factory yesterday morning to discuss a resolution. Due to time constraints, the discussions continued in the afternoon. As a result, 21 workers were approved for layoff by the factory, and severance pay would be issued according to the following regulations: 1. Those employed for three months or more but less than six months would receive five days' pay; those employed for six months or more but less than nine months would receive eight days' pay; those employed for nine months or more but less than one year would receive thirteen days' pay; those employed for one year would receive twenty days' pay; and for each additional three months of employment, an additional five days' pay would be added. The factory expressed its agreement and immediately handed over 480 yuan to the Party and government representatives for distribution, thus resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>Taigoo Labor Dispute Resolved with Signature Yesterday</p>
<p>Midshipmen Decide to Maintain Status Quo</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, a labor dispute arose at the British-owned Taigoo Steamship Company regarding the standard of midshipmen working on its vessels. After repeated efforts by the local Party and government authorities, the dispute was officially resolved with a signed agreement yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Final Mediation: Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a final mediation session. Representatives from the China Shipping Mutual Aid Association, including Zhu Huanqing and Zhu Ruiqing, as well as representatives from the Midshipmen's Union, including Zhou Xiaoting and Lu Rongzhi, attended. Midshipmen representatives, including Lü Shuangxi, and Dai Youheng from the Municipal Party Committee were also present. The session was presided over by Zhu Guilin, a mediator from the Social Affairs Bureau. The chairman began by reporting on the principles agreed upon at the previous meeting and asked for feedback from both parties. The Director of Operations then stated that the principles were endorsed after consideration, but some wording needed to be revised. The labor representatives stated that they agreed with the principles. Following further agreement between both sides, the agreement was signed. The specific measures were postponed for future announcement. However, according to reporters' inquiries, the plan to reduce the number of midshipmen on various vessels was resolved by striving to maintain the status quo, considering the reduction of social unemployment.</p>
<p>Notification of Compliance: After the signing of the agreement, the China Shipping Mutual Aid Association will notify the directors of the Taigoo Yangtze River vessels, such as Anqing, to comply with the agreement and commence operations immediately. The Midshipmen's Union will notify all midshipmen. The worker representatives who were selected from each vessel will return to service on their respective vessels immediately and advise all workers to work with peace of mind. The Social Affairs Bureau is preparing to submit the handling, resolution process, and measures to the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>A Brief Account of Cao Anchang's Visit to Shanghai</p>
<p>Mao, the director of the Suzhou Wuxian Public Security Bureau, stated that Wuxian governs the former Yuanhe and Changzhou counties, as well as areas under the jurisdiction of Taihu Lake, with a vast territory. Bandits in Taihu Lake appear and disappear unpredictably, and kidnappings are frequent. It is necessary to appoint an officer with extensive experience in investigations to serve as the head of the investigation team. It has been found that Cao Anchang, a former detective from the French Concession Police Department, has solved several important cases and is a highly valuable talent for investigation work. He has been specially appointed as the head of the investigation team and has already taken office. The day before yesterday, Director Cao was ordered to come to Shanghai to handle an important case, which was completed yesterday, and he has returned to Suzhou.</p>
<p>Guo Yunguan, Acting President of the First Special District Court, Took Office Yesterday</p>
<p>Guo Yunguan, the newly appointed acting president of the Shanghai First Special District Court of Jiangsu, arrived in Shanghai after being appointed by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The day before yesterday afternoon, he visited Shen Jiayi, the president of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, to discuss the date of taking over the official seal. As the previous president, Zhou Xianjue, had not been to the court since being granted permission to resign, President Guo decided to take over first and then set another date for the swearing-in ceremony. Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, Mr. Guo went to the First Special District Court and took over the official seal, register, and other items. He then issued a notice of his appointment, which is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Notice Regarding Appointment: In accordance with the order of the Ministry of Judicial Administration to appoint Guo Yunguan as the acting president of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court, this court president complied and took office on November 10th. In addition to reporting to the relevant authorities, this notice is hereby issued for general information. After taking office yesterday morning, Mr. Guo met with all members of the civil and criminal divisions, judges, and department heads, giving separate instructions, and asked everyone to work in peace and as usual. When the reporter presented his card for an interview, he was granted an audience. After a brief conversation, President Guo made the following statement: Recent reports stating that I have been ordered to act as the president of this court are inaccurate. I have not been removed from my substantive position as a counselor of the Ministry of Judicial Administration and am only acting here. After taking over, I will not easily change the original staff of this court to ensure continuity. The reporter then inquired about the resignation of the chief clerk, Wan Qian. President Guo replied that he had been persuaded to stay.</p>
<p>Progress of the Municipal Zoo Construction</p>
<p>Construction Project to Be Completed Soon</p>
<p>Equipment Project Actively Underway</p>
<p>The first phase of the construction project for the Municipal Zoo was contracted to San Mori Company in August of this year. Construction began two months ago and will be completed soon. The second phase of the equipment project, such as the installation of water pipes, electrical lights, and the construction of revetments, artificial hills, paving grass, and planting trees, is being accelerated due to urgent needs. In addition to the previously purchased tigers, leopards, kangaroos, and lizards, as well as all the birds and animals from the school grounds, a pair of black bears has recently been ordered to Shanghai, and a pair of lions is expected to arrive soon.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Prohibits Novels that Harm Public Morals</p>
<p>The Shanghai Xinhua Bookstore published an advertisement for the novel "Pan Jinlian's Rebellion of Love" in newspapers. The municipal government considers the content of the book to be harmful to public morals and in violation of the publication regulations issued by the Ministry of Interior. It has been decided to notify the Public Concession authorities to order the bookstore to stop selling the book and to inform all newspapers not to publish the advertisement.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Dredges Pu Zhao River</p>
<p>The Pu Zhao River is one of Shanghai's inland waterways. However, the riverbed is silted up, making navigation difficult. Ma Xiangbo and others petitioned the municipal government to undertake dredging to facilitate water transportation. Upon receiving the petition, the municipal government ordered the Public Works Bureau to draft a plan and the Finance Bureau to allocate funds to facilitate the project. Yesterday, the municipal government ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate the causes of the silting of the Pu Zhao River: One is due to the excessive number of Jiangbei small boats moored along the river, and the daily dumping of waste, which has further obstructed and polluted the waterway. The second is that the river surface in the area from Dapu Bridge to the northwest bank is sometimes filled with soil-carrying vehicles, and some areas have been filled to form embankments. Although the north bank of the river falls within the French Concession, the sovereignty of the riverway belongs entirely to us. Therefore, the bureau is ordered to expel all Jiangbei small boats from the area and prohibit them from permanently mooring there, and to prohibit the filling of soil by earth-carrying vehicles in that area to protect our sovereignty.</p>
<p>Cantonese People Seek Ways to Deal with Opium Offenders in the French Concession</p>
<p>Expenses to Be Shared by All</p>
<p>Work Limited to One Time</p>
<p>Zhao Shibei, the chief prosecutor of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, a Cantonese, recently noted the excessive number of opium offenders in the French Concession and their inability to be accommodated. He and Mayor Wu, Wen Zongyao, Chen Bingqian, and others jointly invited fellow Cantonese people on the 9th of this month to a tea gathering at the Guangzhao Public Hall on Ningbo Road to discuss relief measures. The proceedings of that day's meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chairman Wen Zongyao reported that the French Concession had recently been strictly prohibiting opium, resulting in an increase in opium offenders, the majority of whom were from other provinces. Fellow Cantonese people accounted for one-third of them. The only problem that urgently needs to be solved is accommodation and drug rehabilitation. However, most things cannot be done without money. In the current situation of the court, it is really powerless and wishes to share with fellow Cantonese people.</p>
<p>Zhao Shibei delivered a speech, stating that since the court was taken back, everything has been directly managed by our country, but in fact, there are only obligations and no rights. The French Concession is different from the Public Concession. The Public Concession has more civil cases and fewer criminal cases. The French Concession has fewer civil cases and more criminal cases. Therefore, the court only has subsidies to spend and no income. Since January of this year, the French Consul has ordered a strict ban on smoking opium, and the number of opium offenders has increased daily. The court cannot ignore this and has sent them to various branches for accommodation. There is now a problem of overcrowding, and most offenders are workers and the poor. Since there is no money to fine for compensation, each person also needs 50 cents for daily food. This cannot continue. This matter should be the responsibility of the government, but due to the urgency, there is no budget. Now the court and I have proceeded to build a drug rehabilitation hospital to provide accommodation, but due to lack of funds, it still needs time. However, the opium addiction of the offenders has not been eliminated, and diseases occur from time to time. I hope that fellow Cantonese people will uphold the spirit of benevolence, love, and mutual assistance in times of distress, and work together for our fellow Cantonese people and national dignity.</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng delivered a speech, stating that since the Shanghai Concession Court was taken back, its agreement articles really need to be revised. As for management, it has not been perfected so far, so the urgent task for now is only two points: One is to acquire land in western Shanghai to unify the prisons, and the second is for the court to establish a perfect drug rehabilitation hospital. However, the establishment still needs time. At present, the prison cannot accommodate them, and they cannot rehabilitate in the prison, which is of no help. Ordinary hospitals cannot accommodate so many opium offenders for the court, so the establishment of a temporary drug rehabilitation hospital is imperative. This is where Inspector Zhao's responsibilities lie and is also the inescapable duty of fellow Cantonese people.</p>
<p>Finally, it was resolved to ask Inspector Zhao to count the number of Cantonese opium offenders, the number of days for drug rehabilitation, and the funds required, for cooperation between the various groups. A meeting will be convened at that time, and everyone will share the expenses to achieve a quick result. However, this relief work is limited to one time only.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Public Works in October</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Public Works Department reported on the month of October, stating that many public buildings were completed this month. The foundation of the Tang En Road Bridge and the banks of Feilun Road have been completed, and the section north of Yalu Road is also making great progress. The landfill pond at the Jiwupu Wharf has been completed, and the Jardine Wharf on Zhaofeng Road is being installed. The incinerator on Binlang Road has been tested and accepted on October 5. The furnace on Maohai Road is still being tested by the Shenchang Yanghang. The expansion of the Huishan Prison is proceeding rapidly. The Huishan Patrol Barracks were completed in the middle of the month and are currently leveling the courtyard. Various renovations at the Shajing Road Slaughterhouse are proceeding in unison. The Victoria Hospital is nearing completion, and water, electricity, and gas pipes are being laid. The park drinking fountains in Hongkou have been completed, and work is underway in the Bund and Zhaofeng Parks.</p>
<p>Ding Yue cleared 2,784 tons of road garbage, 2,274 tons of drain sludge, and transported 4,474 tons of domestic waste to the eastern and western districts to fill depressions. 13,032 tons were transported by small boats by contractors, and 7,596 tons were sent to the two incinerators for incineration. 1.63 million gallons of water were used for street watering, and 3.17 million gallons were used for street washing. The average daily employment of laborers this month was 6,495, artisans 563, and foremen 386. The cement factory produced more than 9,900 pieces, and the Pingqiao stone factory shipped more than 9.16 million pieces. 1,352 tons of goods were unloaded at the Huishan Public Wharf. There were 461 new buildings in the concession, 230 plans submitted, 117 approved, 90 houses evaluated, and 4,433 houses inspected.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Agrees to Increase Subsidy to Royal Asiatic Society</p>
<p>The Shanghai Royal Asiatic Society has been granted 50,000 taels by the Shanghai Municipal Council over the past two years to build a new building. In addition, there is an annual subsidy of 1,000 taels. The society recently requested an increase in the subsidy to 12,000 taels per year due to insufficient annual expenses, and also requested exemption from property tax. The Finance Committee discussed the matter, and the Acting Finance Director reported that the amount of tax that could be exempted for the society's building was approximately 2,872 taels. After discussion, the committee concluded that the society's work benefited the entire city of Shanghai and that the society should seek subsidies from municipal authorities in neighboring areas. As for the council's aspect, tax exemption could be permitted. However, the council's subsidies for social undertakings should be clearly stated. Therefore, the committee proposed that in the future, the society's new building should pay the full amount of general tax according to the estimated price, but at the same time, the council would provide a subsidy equal to the amount of the tax. In addition, the annual subsidy of 1,000 taels would continue to be issued. The Board of Directors decided at its meeting on the 10th to increase the annual subsidy to the society by 3,000 taels in addition to the 1,000 taels. However, the society should pay the general tax according to the estimated amount.</p>
<p>Lakeside Society General Tax Assessment Reduced</p>
<p>The Municipal General Tax assessment for the Lakeside Society's clubhouse was previously estimated by the Shanghai Municipal Council to be calculated based on a monthly rent of 1,000 taels. The society subsequently wrote to express its belief that this was excessive. The Finance Committee discussed the matter at its previous meeting. The head of the tax collection department stated that one-third of the society was a memorial hall used for public gatherings, and the remainder was used for the clubhouse and fellow-provincial association. It was found that the monthly rent for the memorial hall was 300 taels. If the society's original situation were to be taken into account, the total amount could be re-estimated at 900 taels. After discussion, the committee concluded that since the society was not on the list of tax-exempt organizations, it should be required to pay the tax based on the estimated amount of 900 taels per month. This proposal has been approved by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>St. Joseph's Charity Society Schedules Relief Distribution</p>
<p>The St. Joseph's Charity Society, located at 21 Nansun Road, Hongkou, has been established for 17 years, with the exclusive purpose of providing relief to the poor. Every year, it provides financial assistance, rice, medicine, and winter clothing to the poor. Regardless of religious affiliation, as long as a nun from the St. Mary's Home certifies that they are truly impoverished, they can receive practical assistance. It has been reported that the society has scheduled a winter relief distribution at the auditorium of St. Francis School in Hongkou on the afternoon of the 19th of this month at 2:30 PM, and invites major philanthropists to attend and observe.</p>
<p>Two Red and Green Traffic Lights Activated</p>
<p>Yesterday, a letter was received from the Traffic Department of the Public Concession Police Department stating that new red and green traffic lights have been installed at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hartung Road and at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Gordon Road. They are scheduled to be activated at 8:00 AM on the 12th.</p>
<p>Record of the Mediation of License Disputes in the Tobacco and Liquor Industry</p>
<p>Yesterday, the nine trade associations of the city's tobacco exchange, soy sauce and liquor, soy sauce garden, sorghum liquor, local yellow wine, restaurant, Shaoxing wine, Fenjiu, and dry tobacco industries held a general meeting of members in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce assembly hall. Over 500 people attended, including members of each industry, Municipal Party Committee representative He Yuanming, and Municipal Chamber of Commerce representative Sun Mingqi. Representatives from the cigarette factory association, including Shen Weiting, arrived later. Chen Liangyu was elected chairman, who announced the opening of the meeting and conducted the ceremony.</p>
<p>The chairman reported that the tobacco and liquor license had been in dispute for a long time due to the increase in the proportion of taxes. Through the mediation and persuasion of Mr. Wu Tingsheng, the interests of both tax revenue and the hardships of businesses were considered. A flexible method was proposed, in which those paying two or four yuan in tax per quarter would have their tax increased by 30%, while those paying eight yuan or more would not be increased. The executive committee members of each industry and the tax bureau representatives agreed to this. Therefore, this meeting was called to report the dispute process and the acceptance of mediation in detail to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings. Next, the representatives from the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce each gave speeches, and the meeting was adjourned for refreshments.</p>
<p>Great Opportunity to Travel to Hong Kong and Little Luzon During Christmas Holidays</p>
<p>Passport and Other Procedures Exempted</p>
<p>Fare Only Half of the Original Price</p>
<p>The Changxing Steamship Company and the Dalai Steamship Company in Shanghai, in order to provide preferential treatment to people from all walks of life traveling during the Christmas holidays this year, have jointly formulated preferential regulations for round-trip tours from Shanghai via Hong Kong to Manila (i.e., Little Luzon). Travelers do not need to go through any passport procedures. The round-trip fare, which was originally US$140 (approximately 665 yuan in Chinese currency), has now been reduced to £22 (approximately 345 yuan in Chinese currency), a reduction of about half. This is an unprecedented price reduction. Passengers can also stay on the ship when arriving in Hong Kong or Little Luzon for sightseeing, saving both trouble and expense. The Changxing Company's Asia Queen will leave port on December 20 and return to Shanghai on January 1. The Dalai Company's President Coolidge is scheduled to leave port on December 24 and return to Shanghai on January 5. For all detailed information and reservations for cabins and purchase of tickets, please contact the China Travel Service.</p>
<p>Beijing Grand Theater Aids Righteous Army</p>
<p>The deep autumn weather has passed, and the weather is getting colder every day. The ladies and gentlemen of Shanghai are mostly planning to buy winter clothes and electric heaters to prepare for the severe cold. But when we think of the volunteers outside Shanhaiguan who are fighting against Japan regardless of their own lives, their salaries and equipment are not sufficiently supplied, and their cold-weather clothing is in great need. How can they withstand the bitter cold and the howling north wind? We are all human beings, who can not feel the pain? Therefore, the colleagues of the Beijing Grand Theater in Shanghai, seeing this, will show a performance on Sunday (i.e., the 13th) morning at 10:00 AM, and all the income will be donated to the Northeast Volunteer Army. It is also heard that the domestic blockbuster "Wild Rose" starring Wang Renmei will be shown, which will be donated by the Lianhua Company.</p>
<p>Traitor Wang Xinfu Escorted to Beijing for Trial</p>
<p>When the January 28th Shanghai Incident occurred, and Zhabei was occupied by the Japanese army, the traitor Wang Xinfu and Hu Lifu took refuge with the Japanese and established the Northern Shanghai Local Maintenance Association, collecting taxes and openly running opium dens and gambling houses, which harmed the good people. The Shanghai Municipal Government had long ordered his arrest. Wang Xinfu was arrested by Jing Shi from the Third Section of the Fifth District on the afternoon of the 25th of last month when a fire broke out at the Huaxing Galoshes Factory he opened on Feihong Road in Hongzhen. It is learned that the Public Security Bureau has completed the detailed interrogation of the criminal Wang and decided to escort him to the Nanjing Military and Political Department for further investigation. Yesterday afternoon at 11:00 AM, the bureau sent an inspector with official documents and statements from the city government, along with a squad leader Dan Bin from the detective team, and detectives Nie Ganchen to escort him to the Nanjing Military and Political Department on the Beijing-Shanghai night express train for trial.</p>
<p>Impersonating Soldiers and Using Counterfeit Banknotes</p>
<p>Yu Caochu, 32 years old, from Zhuji, Zhejiang, impersonated a soldier of the Garrison Headquarters, wearing the insignia of a First Class Private surnamed Chen on his chest, dressed in a gray military uniform, black pants, and leather shoes. He used counterfeit ten-yuan banknotes in various shops in the Nanshi area, buying goods or paying with the counterfeit ten-yuan note for items worth two or three yuan. Many shops have suffered from his actions. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, the impostor Yu Caochu bought cloth worth 1.5 yuan in a foreign goods store in the territory of the Second Precinct of the First District of Nanshi, paid with a counterfeit ten-yuan banknote from the Bank of China, and asked for change. At that time, the shop assistant found that it was a counterfeit banknote (stamped with a "Long" character seal on both sides) and asked him to exchange it. Unexpectedly, the impostor Yu Caochu cursed and claimed that the money issued by their headquarters could not be counterfeit and insisted on using it. The shop assistant, fearing the soldiers of his headquarters, was in the process of negotiating when more and more passers-by gathered, and a crowd was outraged. A patrol officer was called by a passer-by (a ticket seller from a tram company), who acted as a witness on behalf of the shop. The impostor Yu Caochu was taken to the First Precinct of the First District for interrogation. A "Long" character seal was found on his person, which matched the seal on the counterfeit banknote. Therefore, he was sent to the Nanshi District Detective Team office. Interrogated by squad leader Dong Mingde, he confessed to impersonating a soldier, wearing another soldier's insignia, and carrying counterfeit banknotes to defraud people. He also confessed that his accomplice Chen Shutang, took it from Yang San and other members of a gang at the Huayang Inn in Xieqiao, containing three different types of languages. After hearing his confession, squad leader Han immediately led detectives to investigate the location provided by the suspect. They found it deserted. The suspect Yu Caochu was sent back to the First Precinct of the First District to be turned over to the Public Security Bureau for questioning. The detective team continues to search for the fleeing accomplice, Chen Shutang, to bring him to justice.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Major Riot Occurs in Geneva <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Socialists Clash with Nationalists</p>
<p>Riotous Mob Attacks Security Guards and Police</p>
<p>Machine Gun Fire Kills Over Ten, Injures Dozens</p>
<p>Infantry Remains on Alert as Unions Discuss General Strike</p>
<p>Geneva, 9th (National News Agency) - This area, known for its tranquility, suddenly experienced a riot today. According to the latest reports, there are ten dead and fifty-three injured. It began with a gathering of the newly formed Nationalist faction. Socialists and Communists attempted to storm the Nationalist meeting venue, leading to a confrontation. Police efforts to quell the disturbance were ineffective, forcing them to seek assistance from the security guards. However, the rioting mob seized the security guards' weapons, forcing them to retreat to nearby areas. The mob then attacked the security guards, who responded with machine gun fire. The standoff lasted for a long time, with the crowd gradually dispersing towards evening. Currently, Socialists and Communists are holding meetings, planning a city-wide strike starting tomorrow, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ Geneva, 10th (National News Agency) - The death toll from last night's bloody riots has reached twelve as of 10 a.m. this morning. Among the sixty-five seriously injured, several are not expected to recover. The situation remains extremely tense. The Geneva State Council held an emergency meeting last night and, anticipating the Socialists' and Communists' threat of a general strike, decided to order the army and police to be on strict alert.</p>
<p>▲ Geneva, 9th (Reuters) - A disturbance occurred today by Lake Geneva, resulting in the deaths of three demonstrators from machine-gun fire. The demonstration initially began in opposition to two Socialist leaders but escalated into a riot. Police intervened to quell the disturbance but were driven away by the mob. A company of infantry and several trainees were ordered to assist but were also driven back by the mob. The crowd grew larger and larger, seizing weapons from the soldiers and police and chasing them. The military and police were forced to retreat but were then ambushed. The military then opened fire with machine guns, killing three and injuring about thirty.</p>
<p>▲ Geneva, 9th (National News Agency) - Socialists marched in a group to the League of Nations to petition against the war but were blocked from entering. They then paraded through the streets, leading to a clash with the police. They then attempted to attack the city's barracks to seize weapons, leading to a major conflict, resulting in eight deaths and forty-one injuries. The authorities urgently dispatched auxiliary police from Lausanne to restore order. Having failed, the Socialists are reportedly planning a general strike tomorrow. It is reported that after being blocked from the League of Nations today, the Socialists headed to the city's barracks. When soldiers tried to stop them, they grabbed their guns and pushed them to the roadside. The soldiers were then forced to open fire. The demonstrators retreated and then advanced again. The soldiers opened fire with machine guns, and some demonstrators also retaliated with guns, resulting in many deaths and injuries. After the incident, it was found that one police officer had also died, and fifteen were injured.</p>
<p>▲ Geneva, 10th (Reuters) - The number of dead and injured in yesterday's disturbances here is higher than initially reported. It is now known that a total of ten people have died, and forty-one have been injured. The first batch of troops dispatched did not carry ammunition and were driven back by the rioters. However, the later dispatched team was fully equipped with ammunition. It is said that the machine gun fire was directed low, as the military did not want to fire high, resulting in more deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>▲ Geneva, 10th (National News Agency) - Today, police officers here told reporters that the report in the London newspapers that yesterday's Socialist riot resulted in fifty injuries and fifteen deaths is not accurate. After the arrival of the auxiliary police and the suppression of the disturbance, no further incidents occurred. The number of deaths and injuries is extremely difficult to investigate. The latest reports indicate a total of ten deaths and sixty-five injuries. Currently, police officers are constantly patrolling the streets here in cars. A large detachment has been dispatched to protect the League of Nations Secretariat. According to police officers, if the Socialists plan a general strike and disturbances occur, they are prepared to quickly suppress it.</p>
<p>▲ Geneva, 10th (Havas) - Geneva, a place regarded by the whole world as associated with peaceful thought, became a bloody scene last night, with a total of ten dead and forty-four injured, including three seriously injured. There was a demonstration in Geneva last night that was clearly radical in nature. Initially, the right-wing intended to hold a meeting in a closed venue. The initiators decided to hold this gathering because the Geneva Radical Party government respects the right to freedom of speech. However, the Geneva Socialist Party vehemently opposed it in its newspaper, "The Worker." However, the Geneva State Council remained unmoved. The Socialist Party then issued the following instructions to its members: 1) Order all members to pretend to be customers and occupy all the cafes in the area at 7 p.m.; 2) Occupy the meeting venue; 3) If occupying the meeting venue is not possible, create disturbances outside the venue to prevent the meeting from taking place; 4) If the police intervene, resist them, even using violence; and also occupy the streets. In addition, the demonstrators were ordered to prepare some pepper to throw in the faces of the police maintaining order. The demonstrators were recruited from the Geneva Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and unemployed workers in Geneva, numbering about 5,000. The Geneva Socialist Party has never been on good terms with the Swiss Socialist Party and does not belong to the Second International. For many years, it has been creating incidents by exploiting local scandals and taking advantage of public outrage. Those holding the gathering last night were members of the National League, who intended to resolutely prevent the Geneva Socialist Party from disrupting order. When the disturbances occurred, the party leader, Nicola, warned the members in front of the police, saying, "Revolution is necessary at this moment. You should obey orders, occupy the streets, and do not retreat." The Geneva infantry battalion recruits immediately rushed to restore order. These soldiers were few in number and did not carry ammunition. Therefore, the orders issued by Nicola were carried out by his members. The infantry battalion was attacked and disarmed. Just as the members were about to start shooting, reinforcements arrived and opened fire with submachine guns to suppress the situation. The Geneva Executive Council immediately convened a special meeting, and Nicola was immediately arrested. To prevent further disturbances, the Geneva infantry battalion remains on alert. The situation has gradually returned to calm, but the unions are meeting to discuss whether to declare a general strike.</p>
<h3 id="e75">After the Announcement of the US Presidential Election Results <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Hoover Invites Roosevelt to Meet at the White House</p>
<p>Stimson Believes Far East Policy Will Not Change</p>
<p>Democrats Control Congress, Prohibition Likely to be Repealed</p>
<p>New York, 9th (National News Agency) - With the election over, the Republican Party is now focused on maintaining the remnants of its administration, preparing to hand over the White House to its new master on March 4th next year. President Hoover rose early in his home in Palo Alto, gathered reporters, and told them that he planned to return to Washington on Saturday and begin drafting his administrative report to Congress. After leaving office next March, he will return to his hometown to resume his private business. However, he has not yet considered the nature of his future work.</p>
<p>President-elect Roosevelt broadcast a message on the radio in New York this morning to thank the voters. Roosevelt said that this election has a meaning greater than partisan views. It can be said to be an expression of the nation's free thought, indicating that the whole country has a firm belief in the future. I have received this clear mandate and will never forget it. I respectfully invite you to work together to build a great cause.</p>
<p>He then replied to President Hoover, thanking him for yesterday's congratulations, and wired House Speaker Garner, congratulating him on his election as Vice President. After completing the social niceties, he also began preparing his report to the New York State Legislature.</p>
<p>Vice President-elect Garner had gone fishing in the wilderness of Texas the day before the election, saying he was prepared to hear the election news on Thursday. He anticipated that Roosevelt's congratulatory message might not be received until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Amidst the flurry of congratulatory messages, the exhausted poll workers were still buried in their work. It is said that a total of more than 28 million votes were counted. Roosevelt had more than 16,539,000 votes, Hoover had more than 11,947,000 votes, and Socialist candidate Thomas had more than 359,000 votes. (Note: In the last election, the Socialist Party had only 267,420 votes.) This total is not expected to change the previously reported positions of the parties. It is anticipated that Roosevelt will receive 472 electoral votes and Hoover will receive 59.</p>
<p>Although there may be small changes in the division of parties in the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party is indeed in a dominant position, as in the Senate. It is also expected that there will be a strong inclination in the new House of Representatives to repeal prohibition.</p>
<p>▲ Washington, 9th (National News Agency) - US Secretary of State Stimson stated today that the Republican government will not leave difficult problems for the Democratic Party to solve. Stimson told reporters that he believed it was his duty to assist the Democratic Party as much as possible and stated that there were virtually no differences in policy on the Far East issue. He also said that before leaving office, he would cooperate to the best of his ability, following current policies, to facilitate the handover. Senator Swanson, widely regarded as the new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said today that even if there are changes in Far East policy, they will be minimal. However, the issue of Philippine independence may not be resolved in this session of Congress because the newly elected members may not share the same views as the old members.</p>
<p>▲ Washington, 10th (Reuters) - It is reported that President Hoover seems likely to invite President-elect Roosevelt to the White House to discuss political affairs. It is also reported that Secretary of State Stimson hopes that Roosevelt will select his successor as Secretary of State as soon as possible so that Stimson can cooperate with the new appointee and provide all kinds of assistance.</p>
<p>New York, 9th (Reuters) - It is reported that President Hoover plans to step down and retire from political life when his term expires on March 4th next year.</p>
