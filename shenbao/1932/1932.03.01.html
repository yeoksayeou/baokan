<p>頃近英法公使鑒於戰事之日趨激烈。重新斡旋和平。日本東京亦有要求停戰。主張和平解决之空氣。日使重　且曾親往前綫與　田商談。因之和平。空氣。又一時驟見濃厚。重復鼓起一般人土對於悲慘時局之新希冀。上海戰事非上海之局部問題。而爲關係整個世界之嚴重問題蓋爲任何人所不能否認。故今日不僅我國人一致希望和平。世界人士莫不希望和平。即日本之大多數平民亦無不希望和平。所不願和平並且竭全力以破壞和平者。則惟日本之貪婪財閥。暴戾之軍閥及一般爲虎作倀之政客耳。我民旋之酷愛和平。爲世界人士所夙知。去年一九一八禍變突發日軍閥野心畢露。暴行日增。而我終始忍辱負。重爲和平也。此次日軍閥變本加厲强佔東北之足。復進窺淞滬此種野心與暴行使我忍無可忍無可忍奮起抵予野心之軍閥以有效之敎訓亦爲和平也。吾人自始至終。固未嘗背乎和平之原則。抑且巳不惜鉅大犧牲以赴之故吾人今日之。抵抗。不僅爲自衛之正當而且爲必要之手段。又恰爲維護公理與正義之義舉。吾人不僅愛和平希望和平且。巳竭盡全力以維護和平。然而其如日本之軍閥財閥之必欲破壞何。　　自戰禍爆發迄今。和平運動。旣巳數起。然而每一次之和平運動。恰爲日人緩兵之手段。怡爲日軍等待援軍改變戰略重新佈置準備之騙術。每一次和平運動提起之後。日軍必大舉進攻。徵之過去數次。莫不如此。蓋强悍横暴貪婪險詐之軍閥。早巳無信義可言。是則此次之和平運動。又安知非此種騙術之重新試行耶。如其不然。則日之菱刈與白川。曷爲而兼程來滬督師。日之援軍。曷爲而陸續開來。日之大砲與飛機。曷爲而仍繼續其極慘毒之破壞。我自始至終。固未入日領土一步也。亦未入日軍作戰根據地之租界一步也。</p>
<p>不僅此也。邇近國際間對日空氣極爲惡劣。英美各國人士。都主對日施行經濟抵制。國聯且將於三月三日舉行特别會議。對日本侵略上海作有力之制裁。或者日人爲緩和國聯空氣計。故唱和平之調。以渡過國聯特别會議之難關。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者今日之和平運動。究爲不惜任何犧牲以致和平乎。抑必須循正義以爭取和平乎。今日之事。誰爲違反正。義誰爲破壞和平。三尺童子。皆可作答。是則欲維護和平。必先問正義之安在今正義巳爲强暴踐踏於足下。而世人乃欲向强暴商談和平是以正義殉和平也。是不惜任何犧牲以致和平也。此種和。平果有若何之價値。又果能維持其永久耶。國人於其三思。世界人士於此其三思。</p>

<p>受國家豢養願以身殉</p>
<p>謀長期抗拒以待變化</p>
<p>十九路總指揮部參謀處告全國民衆書云</p>
<p>、滬案發生、及今匝月矣、我軍以血肉之軀、與敵重兵利器相激盪、卒能迭挫兇鋒屹然不動國人創痛之餘莫不躍然而興、色然而喜、以爲我國從此可抗强敵、躋高位、與列强分庭抗禮矣、而一部分人士之心理、則適與相反、皇皇焉恐戰禍之延長、貽國家萬刦不復之境夫逆來順受、萎靡不振、固爲國人之通病誇大之心理僥倖之希望亦非吾人所應有、拯民族國家於危亡伸公理正養於世界、此種艱鉅之工作非一蹴可致、尤非可以畏難而退者也、同人受國家豢養以身殉國義所應兩、及今以未死之身、願貢一言爲國人告、</p>
<p>吾人欲知滬案之肇因懸揣將來之結果、必須明了日本之國情及世界之大勢、日本自山縣有朋·面田中義一·遞及現在之犬養毅、其所謂大陸政策、始終一貫而不少變、甲午之役奪取朝鮮、實爲北進之發端、日俄之戰樹立大陸政策之基礎、加以二十一條件之保障、郭松齡張作霖之被殺、日本在東北之勢、遂益形鞏固、其第一步之侵略乃告成功、於是　機佔領東北　及中國内部之志、益不能忘懐、</p>
<p>歐戰以還、各國經濟衰落、工商　敝、關稅戰爭之劇烈、賠欵問題之僵化、世界經濟恐慌之現象、益趨嚴重加以蘇俄崛起赤化大防、時虞潰决而國際之間復不减少其嫌猜、無論對内對外各有其難言之痛苦、至於中國之混亂衰殘則更無以况之虎視　　之日本、豈肯放過此良好機會、於是去年九一八、一聲　　　摧陷瀋陽、　括三省而去矣、</p>
<p>瀋案發生、我國政府、隱忍退讓、信賴國聯、以謀和平正當之解决、惟是國聯之於各國、非能如臂使指、蓋國聯爲腦、列强乃爲腦細胞也、細胞不健全、而欲腦之有能力也難矣、是以瀋案發生之初、國聯固不乏人仗義執言、但不久即由噯昧而軟化、由軟化而袒日矣、</p>
<p>反觀我國社會、則爭奪者如故、依賴者如故、加以民衆憤激越出常軌、輿論龐雜、莫衷一是使執政者忙於應付、無所適從、旣不能　復不能和、日帝國主義者、看透事實、更毫無疑義、而伸鐵腕於中國内部、一二八之滬變遂以爆發、</p>
<p>敝軍衛戍京滬首當其衝、矢守土禦侮、爲軍人天職、且上海爲吾國經濟中心南京爲中央政府所在、京滬不保、國脈即斷、是以毅然决然、以自衛之目的、與暴日相週旋、一月以來、敵之兇暴行爲、日益加厲、吾國同胞、慘死於鐵蹄之下者、奚啻萬數、物質之被毁滅者、其價値且不可估計、然而吾國同胞、毫不因損失鉅大、而减少其勃躍情緖、且增加無限之希望、世界輿論、亦因日宼之兇殘、及不惜擴大戰禍、而提出抗議、英美等國、積極干涉之態、且漸趨於具體而明顯、然後知惟有奮鬥、乃足以發揚民族精神、延展民族生命、惟有自助、以求自力之生存、乃能博得世界之同情、暴力雖强、終不能壓倒正義也、</p>
<p>雖然、中國之前途、即可告樂觀乎、英美各國、果爲正義出而裁制暴日乎、暴日即能翻然而變更其一貫之「國策」乎、吾人皆不能無疑者也、吾國物質利器之不及人、自無庸諱言、欲一戰而屈强數、在理在勢、均有所未能、英國則素以穩健外交、著稱於世界、美國則鞭長莫及、望洋興嘆、且皆因國家經濟恐慌、不能自拔而於對日問題、破壞其反俄陣線、亦不無顧慮、謂能出而積極制日豈可遽信、至於日本軍閥之　武主義正如旭日之升、吾人遙聆出淵在美謂美日兩軍、當在滬作球戲、及日軍閥謂十九路軍未知日帝國之威力、故敢與之拒抗之語、其氣燄之高、不可一世、即其國民大多數亦未减其信賴武力之心理此次總選、政友會仍佔勝利、即可以覘之欲其將所謂關係日本存亡之大陸政策一舉而更張之、尤絕無希望者也、</p>
<p>顧於另一方面以觀察之、則英美正以挽救其經濟恐慌、需賴中國巨大之市塲而不願中日戰禍之延長、尤不願坐視其東方商業根據地上海之陷於危險、更不願日本稱覇東方、破壞門戶開放機會均等之局勢、故雖有種種困難終必有爲解决自身利害而奮起干涉之一日、再以日本未來之難關言之、日本自瀋案發生後、海外貿易、一落千丈國家財政、巳陷於極困難之境、加以侵滬軍費總選舉會之臨時支出、美國名流更倡言對日經濟絕交、蓋足令社會恐慌·金融混亂·且嫉視者衆、外交孤立國内輿情漸趨非戰、勞師費財、持久作戰、不戢自焚豈可倖免、</p>
<p>吾人從此可知對日應取之方針矣、日方利在速戰、挾其利器重兵、欲一舉而屈服我國作城下之盟操宰割之柄、我國則應謀長期之拒抗、以待國際之變化、及敵國自身之崩潰、毌以目前軍事之勝利、期僥倖之成功、毌懼戰禍之延長、生苟安之妄念歛其氣而不肆、持其志而不懈、日本一日不罷兵、外交一日不勝利、則我國一日不停止武力拒抗、至暴力屈服於公理之日、即吾國民族復興之時夫法謀獨立奮鬥百年、勾踐復仇臥薪廿載、我國四萬萬同胞誠能立下决心誓死抗日、則或可不俟諸百年也、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Is Peace in Sight? <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the British and French envoys, seeing the increasingly fierce fighting, have resumed mediating for peace. There is also an atmosphere in Tokyo, Japan, calling for a ceasefire and advocating a peaceful solution. The Japanese envoy, Shigemitsu, even personally went to the front line to discuss with Ueda. Because of this, the atmosphere of peace has suddenly become dense again, repeatedly arousing new hopes among the general public for the tragic situation. The Shanghai war is not a local problem for Shanghai, but a serious problem that affects the entire world, which cannot be denied by anyone. Therefore, today, not only do our people unanimously hope for peace, but people all over the world hope for peace. Even the majority of ordinary people in Japan hope for peace. The only ones who do not want peace and are doing everything possible to undermine peace are the greedy financial tycoons, the violent warlords, and the general political lackeys of Japan. Our people's deep love for peace has long been known to people around the world. Last year, the unexpected catastrophe of 1918 occurred, and the ambition of the Japanese warlords was fully revealed, and their atrocities increased day by day. But from beginning to end, we endured humiliation and bore the heavy burden, all for the sake of peace. This time, the Japanese warlords have intensified their efforts to forcibly occupy the Northeast, and have further coveted Songhu. This kind of ambition and atrocity made us unable to bear it any longer, and we resolutely rose up to give the ambitious warlords an effective lesson, also for the sake of peace. From beginning to end, we have never violated the principle of peace, and we have not hesitated to make huge sacrifices to achieve it. Therefore, our resistance today is not only a legitimate means of self-defense, but also a necessary means, and it is precisely a righteous act to uphold justice and righteousness. We not only love peace and hope for peace, but also have done everything possible to maintain peace. However, what can be done about the fact that the Japanese warlords and financial tycoons are determined to undermine it? Since the outbreak of the war, peace movements have been launched several times. However, each peace movement is precisely a means for the Japanese to delay their troops, and a deceptive trick for the Japanese army to wait for reinforcements, change their strategy, and redeploy their preparations. After each peace movement is launched, the Japanese army will launch a large-scale offensive. This has been the case several times in the past. The strong, tyrannical, greedy, cunning warlords have long lost their credibility. So, how can we know that this peace movement is not a re-trial of this kind of deception? If not, then why did the Japanese Hishikari and Shirakawa come to Shanghai in double-quick time to supervise the troops? Why are the Japanese reinforcements coming one after another? Why do the Japanese artillery and aircraft continue their extremely brutal destruction? From beginning to end, we have not entered Japanese territory by even one step, nor have we entered the concession, which is the Japanese army's base of operations, by even one step.</p>
<p>Not only that, but recently the international atmosphere towards Japan has been extremely bad. People in Britain, the United States, and other countries are advocating economic sanctions against Japan. The League of Nations will also hold a special meeting on March 3 to impose effective sanctions on Japan's invasion of Shanghai. Perhaps the Japanese are singing a tune of peace in order to ease the atmosphere in the League of Nations and to get through the difficult hurdle of the League of Nations' special meeting.</p>
<p>Moreover, what is more important is whether today's peace movement is to achieve peace at any cost, or whether we must seek peace through justice? In today's affairs, who is violating justice and who is undermining peace? Even a three-year-old child can answer. Therefore, if we want to maintain peace, we must first ask where justice lies. Now justice has been trampled underfoot by violence, and the world wants to discuss peace with violence. This is justice sacrificed for peace. This is achieving peace at any cost. What value does this kind of peace have? And can it maintain its permanence? People in our country should think about this carefully. People all over the world should think about this carefully.</p>

<h3 id="e3">The Enemy Repeatedly Attacks Baziqiao <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Advancing and Retreating More Than Ten Times</p>
<p>Our Troops Block and Defend the Original Defense</p>
<p>After our troops routed the attacking enemy troops yesterday morning, they pursued them for a while. Due to the battle line, they still defended their original defense. Unexpectedly, when the enemy troops saw us withdraw to defend, they immediately regrouped their remnants and attacked our Baziqiao again. The enemy's artillery fire resumed, gradually becoming denser. They retreated around 2:00 PM, and attacked us again around 3:00 PM, and then retreated again. They attacked again at 4:30 PM, and were also repelled by our troops. The sound of artillery fire subsided slightly at the same time. Around 8:30 PM in the evening, the enemy troops attacked the Baziqiao area again, firing continuously. It slowed down slightly around 11:30 PM. No less than 600 artillery shells were fired. The houses in Baziqiao and Nanlinli on Hai'ning Road caught fire due to the enemy planes dropping incendiary bombs and being hit by enemy shells. When the enemy troops attacked Baziqiao, two enemy armored vehicles were destroyed by our bombing. The situation is as follows: At 12:00 noon yesterday, the enemy troops regrouped their remnants and charged at our troops with eight armored vehicles. Twelve planes circled around our military positions. Our troops initially responded calmly, and then engaged in hand-to-hand combat. After holding out for half an hour, the enemy could not withstand it and collapsed. Two armored vehicles were destroyed by our troops on the spot. Countless Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. According to wounded soldiers returning from the front line, a part of the Shanghai youth student volunteer army also participated in the battle, and they were exceptionally brave. It is said that the students had received long-term military training. He Zhiyong, a student from a certain middle school, died in the battle, which is a pity. After the enemy troops were defeated and retreated, they guarded at a place about 100 yards away from our troops until 3:00 PM. The enemy attacked again, and the number of enemy armored vehicles was still increased to eight. Our troops used small cannons to fire at them from a short distance. The enemy armored vehicles were hit several times and then retreated again. However, the enemy troops fought fiercely in a bloody battle with our troops. Six planes opened machine guns and shot down at our troops. Our troops fought bravely and resisted desperately. In this battle, about 300 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. At 4:30 PM, hundreds of enemy soldiers jumped out of the trenches, and three armored vehicles charged at the barbed wire defense line of the Baziqiao Garden. Our troops were a hundred times more courageous and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. The enemy failed to achieve its goal and fled in panic. The enemy's artillery shells were densest from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM. Our troops also returned fire with artillery. The civilian houses behind Baziqiao were hit, and flames rose everywhere throughout the day, spreading extremely widely. After the battle of Baziqiao began, at the same time, enemies also rushed out from Binxing Road, Tiantong'an Road, and Zhabei, which is close to the North Railway Station, Jianglu. The number of people was about 1,000, and 13 armored vehicles were used to lead the charge. Two vehicles were trapped in large trenches. Our defending soldiers followed suit and destroyed one armored vehicle. Seeing that there was preparation, the enemy stopped fighting after two hours and did not dare to come out. The enemy's artillery fire also changed from dense to sparse. About 40 enemy soldiers died on the Hongjiang Road side. It is reported that the enemy has spread the news that they will launch a general attack on our troops within three days. If the attack is still ineffective, they will retreat and cease fighting. Around 8:30 PM in the evening, the enemy troops again left a large number of ground forces, about 3,000 people, and gathered to attack Tiantong'an Road and Baziqiao fiercely. The sound of artillery fire rose one after another, and the sound of machine guns rose from time to time. The enemy used artillery to threaten our troops, but they remained motionless, waiting for the enemy to approach before firing back. The enemy advanced and retreated, but ultimately failed to achieve their goal. Our troops soon jumped out and pursued them. The enemy troops resisted with machine guns and grenades. Our troops gave them a fierce counterattack. The enemy soldiers were finally unable to withstand it and retreated. Before long, they came back again. Our troops used hand-held machine guns and mortars to fire at them. The enemy still stubbornly advanced. Our troops rose up and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with them. The enemy immediately collapsed, but soon came again. The enemy troops advanced and retreated more than ten times along Tiantong'an Road and Baziqiao. Until about 11:00 PM, the enemy still failed to achieve anything. At the same time, our troops' counterattack was very fierce, so they collapsed and retreated. However, our troops firmly defended the original defense line and did not pursue them. The enemy's artillery bombardment gradually subsided. Around 11:45 PM, sporadic artillery fire resumed and had not stopped at the time of writing.</p>
<p>From 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM last night, the enemy troops again used artillery to bombard our positions in Baziqiao and Qingyun Road from Hongkou Park. Our troops ignored it because they did not see the enemy's infantry advancing. Moreover, the enemy's artillery fire was fired about every few minutes, and it was all demonstrative in nature. The enemy has been repelled by the bravery of our troops in every short-range battle, and they have suffered deeply and are extremely frightened. Last night, the reporter met a certain regimental commander of our side, who said that our troops responded to the enemy with composure everywhere. The enemy troops habitually disturbed us with artillery fire once in the morning around 5:00 AM, once at noon around 1:00 PM, and once in the evening. We are used to it, and it is as common as three meals a day, and it is not surprising. Moreover, for the sake of the enemy, it is extremely boring to consume ammunition every day and get nothing in return. Our troops strictly adhere to the principle of self-defense, so we often hope that the enemy will come to fight to the death, so that our troops can give them a head-on blow to our satisfaction.</p>

<p>Fierce Battle at Yanjiazhai, Enemy Retreats</p>
<p>About 400 Enemy Casualties</p>
<p>The enemy troops in the Jiangwan area launched three attacks yesterday morning and failed. They immediately gathered more than 10,000 remnants around Dashenzhai. At about 1:00 PM, under the cover of aircraft, they launched an attack on our Xiaochangmiao and Yanjiazhai positions. About 20 minutes later, the enemy stopped shelling and the infantry rushed out. Our troops immediately fought bravely. After holding out for an hour, our troops drew a large detachment of infantry and launched a flanking attack. At the same time, when the enemy's vanguard was approaching our front line about 350 meters away, our troops immediately launched a fierce attack, cutting the enemy's vanguard infantry, about 2,000 people, into several sections. The enemy almost collapsed and was unable to form an army. At the same time, they saw our flanking troops coming to kill. They retreated to the rear. At 2:40 PM, some of them broke out and ran away. Most of the rest were killed by our troops. At about 3:00 PM, they were completely resolved by us. The infantry in the center saw the defeat of the vanguard infantry and did not dare to go deep. The enemy's casualties were about 400 people. There were small contacts in the Miaohang area after 7:00 PM last night. Our front line made slight progress.</p>

<p>Enemy Troops Failed to Attack Fenshanzhai the Night Before</p>
<p>No Fighting Yesterday, But the Enemy Was Very Busy with Transportation</p>
<p>In the Wusong area, from yesterday morning to the afternoon, except for a few enemy planes flying for reconnaissance, it was very quiet. More than a dozen enemy ships were anchored far away in the sea outside the port, and there were no special actions. However, the enemy's transportation and deployment along the Yunzaobang and Zhanghuabang Yangshupu areas in the Huangpu River seemed to be very busy. Judging from this, the date of the great battle is imminent again. In addition, around 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, enemy troops attacked Fenshanzhai south of Jijaqiao, and were defeated by our troops that night. The situation yesterday and the battle situation the night before last are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>[P Wusong Was Quieter Yesterday Wusong</p>
<p>On the surface, yesterday was unusually quiet. The enemy and our troops on the Yunzaobang front were still guarding each other across the river. There was no change in the front lines of both sides along the Sitang River. Eleven enemy ships outside Wusongkou were all far away from the coast outside our fortress's fire line. From morning to 3:00 PM, they never opened fire on the fortress to attack.</p>
<p>According to another report, at about 6:00 PM yesterday, 15 enemy ships were still on the Bailonggang sea surface and showed no signs of launching. However, there were also two other transport ships parked next to the ships. Judging from their draft level, they seemed to be very heavy. It is said that they were all corpses of our residents who were arrested and killed, preparing to be transported back to Japan, falsely claiming to their government and people that they were Chinese soldiers in plain clothes, as evidence of victory.</p>
<h3 id="e6">A Large Number of Enemy Troops Headed to the Front Line Yesterday Morning <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Around 8:00 AM, two enemy shallow-water transport ships and a Jinxingwan tugboat, towing six large iron-shell barges, each ship fully loaded with enemy soldiers, about 4,000 people, and a large number of artillery, machine guns, mortars, and other military equipment, sailed one after another to the front of the Yinhang Water and Electricity Plant and landed, and were immediately loaded by a large number of trucks waiting there. Enemy soldiers went by the water and electricity road. Among them, about five or six hundred enemy soldiers walked along the Jungong Road and were heard to be going to the Zhanghuabang area. The enemy soldiers' luggage was very little, and the military equipment they carried was very simple except for military equipment.</p>

<p>Around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, nine enemy planes, divided into three groups, flew from Shanghai to Song and reconnoitered in our military positions for a long time, but did not drop bombs, and then went west.</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Enemy Attacked Fenshanzhai the Night Before Last and Invaded Songnan <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese troops in Heiqiao, Zhaojiabang, Houjiamuqiao, and other places suddenly launched a fierce attack on the northwest at 8:00 PM the night before last (the 28th), rushing to the Fenshanzhai area, which is about three miles south of Jijaqiao. Our troops did not prepare because of their sudden arrival, and they did not respond calmly to the fierce attack. When they approached, they resisted with all their strength and repelled the enemy. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army was strong and strong, and launched a second charge. At the same time, three or four bombers flew in the sky, dropping sulfur fireballs, bombs, and other things to guide the battle, and the momentum was extremely fierce. The Japanese marine artillery took the planes as targets, but our troops were prepared, so they were able to cope quite well. First, the entire regiment's strength was published on the front and left and right wings in three ways. When the enemy troops invaded the defense line and positions, our troops protruded from the left and right wings, and the front bravely attacked, forming a large encircling posture, surrounding the enemy in the core, and fiercely bombing with artillery and machine guns for more than an hour. It was not until 9:20 that the enemy was bombed to death by about 1,000 people, and the rest were unable to support it and fled. In this battle, our troops were not greatly injured. It is said that the fierceness of this battle was no less than that of Miaohang Caojiaqiao.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Open Letter to the People of the Country from the 19th Route Army <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Raised by the State, Willing to Die for the Country</p>
<p>Seek Long-Term Resistance to Await Changes</p>
<p>The General Staff Office of the 19th Route Army issued an open letter to the people of the country, saying,</p>
<p>The Shanghai Incident has been going on for a month now. Our army used flesh and blood to clash with the enemy's heavy troops and sharp weapons, and was able to repeatedly defeat the fierce attacks and stand still. After the pain, the people of the country are all leaping up with excitement and joy, thinking that our country can resist strong enemies from now on, rise to a high position, and compete with the great powers. However, the psychology of some people is just the opposite. They are panicked about the extension of the war, which will bring the country to a state of eternal ruin. To accept adversity and submit to it, and to be dispirited and unenterprising, is indeed a common problem of the people of the country. Exaggerated psychology and wishful thinking are also not what we should have. To save the nation and the country from danger and to extend justice to the world, this kind of arduous work cannot be achieved overnight, and it cannot be retreated because of fear of difficulty. We have been raised by the state and it is our duty to die for the country. Now, with our bodies not yet dead, we would like to contribute a word to tell the people of the country.</p>
<p>If we want to know the cause of the Shanghai Incident and guess the future results, we must understand Japan's national conditions and the general trend of the world. From Yamagata Aritomo, Tanaka Giichi, to the current Inukai Tsuyoshi, their so-called continental policy has been consistent from beginning to end and has not changed at all. The Sino-Japanese War seized Korea, which was the beginning of the northward advance. The Russo-Japanese War established the foundation of the continental policy. With the guarantee of the Twenty-One Demands, the assassination of Guo Songling and Zhang Zuolin, Japan's power in the Northeast has become more and more consolidated. Its first step of aggression was successful, so its ambition to occupy the Northeast and the interior of China could not be forgotten.</p>
<p>Since the European War, the economies of various countries have declined, industry and commerce have been ruined, the tariff war has been fierce, the debt problem has been deadlocked, and the phenomenon of the world economic panic has become more and more serious. In addition, the rise of Soviet Russia and the prevention of redification are always in danger of collapse, and there is no less suspicion between countries. Whether domestic or foreign, they all have unspeakable pain. As for China's chaos and decline, there is no way to describe it. Japan, which is eyeing it covetously, is unwilling to let go of this good opportunity, so on September 18 last year, a sound destroyed Shenyang and encompassed the three provinces.</p>
<p>After the Shenyang Incident, our government endured and retreated, trusting the League of Nations to seek a peaceful and proper solution. However, the League of Nations is not able to command each country as it pleases. The League of Nations is the brain, and the great powers are the brain cells. It is difficult for the brain to be capable if the cells are not healthy. Therefore, at the beginning of the Shenyang Incident, there was no lack of people in the League of Nations who spoke up for justice, but soon it became ambiguous and softened, and from softening to siding with Japan.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country's society, the struggles are as usual, the reliance is as usual, coupled with the people's anger going beyond the norm, the public opinion is complex, and there is no consensus, making the rulers busy dealing with it and at a loss. It is neither possible to fight nor to make peace. The Japanese imperialists have seen through the facts and have no doubt that they will extend their iron fist into the interior of China, and the Shanghai Incident on January 28 has erupted.</p>
<p>Our army garrisoned the capital and Shanghai, taking the brunt of the attack, and swore to defend the territory and resist the invasion, which is the duty of soldiers. Moreover, Shanghai is the economic center of our country and Nanjing is the location of the central government. If the capital and Shanghai are not protected, the national lifeline will be broken. Therefore, we resolutely decided to deal with the violent Japan for the purpose of self-defense. For a month, the enemy's brutal behavior has become more and more serious. Countless compatriots of our country have died tragically under their iron hooves, and the value of the destroyed materials is inestimable. However, our compatriots have not reduced their vigorous emotions due to the huge losses, and have increased their infinite hope. World public opinion has also protested against the ferocity of the Japanese bandits and their willingness to expand the war. The attitude of active intervention by Britain, the United States, and other countries is gradually becoming concrete and obvious. Then we know that only struggle can promote the national spirit and prolong the national life. Only by self-help and seeking self-reliance can we win the sympathy of the world. Although violence is strong, it cannot ultimately overwhelm justice.</p>
<p>However, can China's future be said to be optimistic? Will Britain, the United States, and other countries come forward for justice to sanction the violent Japan? Will the violent Japan be able to turn around and change its consistent "national policy"? We all cannot help but doubt. We must not hide the fact that our country's material weapons are inferior to others. It is impossible to defeat a strong enemy in one battle, both in reason and in momentum. Britain has always been known for its prudent diplomacy in the world, and the United States is beyond its reach and sighs at the ocean. Moreover, both are unable to extricate themselves from the national economic panic, and they also have concerns about destroying their anti-Russian front on the issue of Japan. How can we believe that they will come forward and actively sanction Japan? As for the militarism of the Japanese warlords, it is like the rising sun. We remotely hear that Izumi said in the United States that the US and Japanese armies should play a ball game in Shanghai, and the Japanese warlords said that the 19th Route Army did not know the power of the Japanese Empire, so they dared to resist it. Their arrogance is unmatched, and most of their people have not reduced their psychology of trusting in military force. This general election, the Seiyukai still won, which can be seen. It is even more hopeless to want them to change their so-called continental policy, which is related to Japan's survival, in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, Britain and the United States are trying to save their economic panic and need to rely on China's huge market, and are unwilling to prolong the war between China and Japan. They are especially unwilling to sit idly by and watch their eastern commercial base, Shanghai, fall into danger, and are even more unwilling for Japan to dominate the East and destroy the open door and equal opportunity situation. Therefore, although there are various difficulties, there will eventually be a day when they will rise up to intervene in order to solve their own interests. Looking at Japan's future difficulties, since the Shenyang Incident, Japan's overseas trade has plummeted, and the national finances have fallen into an extremely difficult situation. In addition, the military expenses for the invasion of Shanghai and the temporary expenses for the general election have caused leading American figures to advocate economic severance of relations with Japan. This is enough to cause social panic, financial chaos, and jealousy. Domestic public opinion is gradually becoming anti-war, and it is inevitable that it will be self-immolating if it wastes its troops and money and wages a protracted war.</p>
<p>From this, we can know the policy that should be taken towards Japan. Japan's interest lies in a quick battle, using its sharp weapons and heavy troops to subdue our country in one fell swoop, make a treaty of surrender, and seize the power of domination. Our country should seek long-term resistance to await international changes and the collapse of the enemy country itself. Do not expect a lucky success with the current military victory. Do not fear the prolongation of the war and have the delusion of seeking peace. Collect its strength and do not give in, and hold its ambition and do not slacken. If Japan does not cease its troops for one day and diplomacy is not victorious for one day, then our country will not stop armed resistance for one day. The day when violence succumbs to justice will be the time when our nation will be revived. France plotted independence and struggled for a hundred years, and Goujian slept on brushwood and tasted gall for twenty years to seek revenge. If the 400 million compatriots of our country can make up their minds and vow to resist Japan to the death, then perhaps it will not be necessary to wait for a hundred years.</p>
<h3 id="e10">The Enemy Wants to Destroy Our Transportation <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Pretending That Our Country is Using it to Transport Troops</p>
<p>In Reality, They Want to Expand the State of War</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Has Already Replied Sternly</p>
<p>The Japanese army's invasion and repeated general attacks have all failed. Therefore, they have repeatedly transferred reinforcements to Shanghai. Recently, because our army has firmly defended and resisted, they have failed to achieve their goals. They have actually used the excuse that our country is using the railway for military transportation, and yesterday (the 29th), the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Murai, sent a letter to the municipal government, stating that they would destroy the railway lines between Suzhou and Shanghai, and between Shanghai and Jiaxing. Their brutality is unparalleled. After receiving the letter, the municipal government immediately replied sternly,</p>
<p>and reiterated that all responsibilities arising from this should be borne by the Japanese side. At the same time, it will be able to inform the consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai, and issue a public notice. The following is a transcript of the various documents:</p>
<h3 id="e11">Letter from the Japanese Consul Dear Sir, According to Accurate Reports from All Sources, <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Your Country's Military and Constitutional Officers Have Recently Been Dispatching Successive Reinforcements from Various Places to Concentrate Here, and These Reinforcements are Mostly Transported by Rail. This Kind of Action is Enough to Make the Situation Increasingly Expand. If Your Country's Troops Continue to Reinforce, the Japanese Army Will, as an Inevitable Measure of Self-Defense, After January 2, Have an Attempt to Destroy the Railway Lines and Military Trains Between Jiaxing and Suzhou to Shanghai for the Use of Your Country's Troops. Therefore, in Order to Prevent Harm to the General Residents, We Will Provide Measures to Notify All Parties, and We Hope that Your Mayor Will Also Immediately Notify the Residents Near Shanghai to Pay Attention to Corresponding Matters. I Will Respond to You Immediately, and I Hope You Will Investigate and Handle it. Sincerely,</p>
<h3 id="e12">Municipal Government Reply Dear Sir, Your Letter of February <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>

Your Various Brutal Acts of Violating Public Law and Conventions and Disregarding Humanity Have Been Subjected to Serious Protests by Our Mayor to Your Consul-General. All Actions of Our Country's Troops Are Within the Scope of Self-Defense, and the Reason Why the Situation is Increasingly Expanding is All Due to Your Country's Repeated Dispatch of Reinforcements, Increasing the War. If Your Country's Troops Continue to Attack Our Country's Troops, Then Our Country's Troops Will Have No Choice But to Take Appropriate Self-Defense Methods, and All Responsibilities Arising Therefrom Should Still Be Borne by Your Country. I Approve of Your Letter and Respond Accordingly.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>I Have Just Received a Letter from the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Which Briefly States (See Above), etc. Since the Night of January 28, Japanese Troops Have Continued to Invade Our Country's Territory and Slaughter Our Country's People. Your Various Brutal Acts of Violating Public Law and Conventions and Disregarding Humanity Have Been Subjected to Serious Protests by Our Mayor and I Have Written to Your Consul-General to Inform You. All Actions of Our Country's Troops Are Within the Scope of Self-Defense, and the Reason Why the Situation is Increasingly Expanding is All Due to Japan's Repeated Dispatch of Reinforcements, Hoping to Achieve Its Purpose of Aggression. The Meaning of the Japanese Consul's Letter is Nothing More Than an Excuse to Cover Up Their Bombing of Civilians. Now, In Order to Take Into Account the Safety of Your Country's Nationals' Lives and Property, I Am Responding With a Letter. Please Investigate and Inform Your Country's Nationals Accordingly.</p>

<p>Regarding the matter of a proclamation: A letter from the Japanese Consul-General has been received, using as a pretext that our country's authorities are using the railways for military transport, declaring that from March 2nd, they will destroy the railway sections from Suzhou to Shanghai and from Jiaxing to Shanghai. Since January 28th, the Japanese army has violated public laws and conventions, disregarding humanitarian principles in various brutal acts. Despite repeated serious protests from this mayor, the acts have continued unabated. With the approval of the aforementioned letter, in addition to separate correspondence by letter and telegram, it is hereby urgently proclaimed to the residents along the railway lines to be fully informed and to find ways to evacuate promptly for their safety. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Japanese Naval Soldiers in the Concession</p>
<h3 id="e15">Arrest Our Military Officer, Wang Geng <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The City Government Lodges a Serious Protest with the Diplomatic Body</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 27th), at noon, Wang Geng, the brigade commander of the Independent Brigade of the Shanghai Garrison Division, was passing Huangpu Road in the Public Concession on business when he was suddenly arrested by Japanese naval soldiers and handed over to the Hongkou Police Station to be taken away by the Japanese naval soldiers. His whereabouts and condition are still unknown. After receiving the report, the city government lodged a serious protest last night with the Doyen of the Consular Body, Mr. Cunningham, and the consuls of various countries. The transcript of the protest letter is as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully, according to reports, on February 27th, Wang Geng, a brigade commander of our country, was passing Huangpu Road on business when he was suddenly chased and arrested by Japanese naval soldiers. The brigade commander took refuge in the Astor House Hotel, which is owned by a British merchant and is located nearby. After the Municipal Council police arrived to assist in the capture, he was sent to the Hongkou Police Station. Although the police chief in charge inquired about the military officer's background, he handed him over to the Japanese naval soldiers, and his whereabouts and condition are still unknown.</p>
<p>Based on this, the incident occurred within the jurisdiction of the Public Concession authorities. Why were the Japanese naval soldiers allowed to arbitrarily arrest Chinese citizens? This is the first incomprehensible point. After the brigade commander was arrested and sent to the police station with the assistance of the Municipal Council police, if no criminal behavior was found, he should have been released immediately, and the Japanese soldiers who had privately arrested the passerby should have been detained and handed over to their country's authorities for legal punishment. Even if the brigade commander had violated police regulations or committed a crime, he should have been transferred to the competent court for adjudication. Why were the provisions of the law and the agreement disregarded, and he was handed over to the Japanese soldiers at their request? This is the second incomprehensible point.</p>
<p>It has been found that although the Concession authorities have repeatedly declared neutrality, they have not taken effective measures to stop Japan's actions that undermine the neutrality of the Concession. This mayor has repeatedly lodged serious protests on record. However, the Municipal Council police are now going even further, assisting Japanese naval soldiers within the protected area of the Concession authorities to illegally arrest our country's military officers and hand them over to the Japanese military authorities for free disposal. What is the meaning of maintaining neutrality? What is the meaning of protecting the lives and property of the people? This is the third incomprehensible point.</p>
<p>In addition to having sent personnel to negotiate with your Consul-General regarding the aforementioned situation, a serious protest is hereby lodged. Please, your Consul-General, take immediate action to release the military officer and punish the responsible personnel accordingly. As for the demand for compensation and the reservation of rights, this is hereby communicated. I trust you will investigate and handle this matter and reply accordingly.</p>
<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post* reports that Wang, who was</p>
<p>arrested by Japanese sailors at the Astor House Hotel last Saturday, is now known to be General Wang Geng, the brigade commander of the Second Independent Brigade of the Chinese 87th Division. He graduated from the West Point Military Academy in the United States more than ten years ago. When he was arrested, he was seen by Municipal Council police officers who consulted with the Japanese sailors and escorted Wang to the Hongkou Police Station for questioning. However, after arriving at the police station, he was taken away by the Japanese sailors and his whereabouts are unknown. According to an informal agreement between the Japanese authorities and the Municipal Council authorities, anyone in the Public Concession suspected of being involved in illegal activities should be arrested by members of the Hongkou Police Station upon application by Japanese army or navy guards. However, this arrest of Wang did not follow this procedure. The Japanese claim that Wang was one of the commanders of the Chinese forces in Zhabei. However, Wang insists that he went to Hongkou to visit the American Consulate, unaware that it had moved to Jiangxi Road. When questioned by the Japanese sailors, he took refuge in the Astor House Hotel, but the Japanese soldiers pursued him and arrested him. The Nineteenth Route Army General Staff lodged a protest with the consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai today (the 29th), stating that if unarmed Chinese soldiers can be arbitrarily arrested in the Concession, then Chinese wounded soldiers entering the Concession can also be detained by the Japanese army and navy. The Consular Body and the Municipal Council had not received this formal protest by noon today, but it is reported that the consulates and the Municipal Council are now conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu</p>
<h3 id="e16">Receives Foreign Press Reporters <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Justice and Righteousness Will Surely Obtain Final Victory Mayor Wu received foreign press reporters at the Cathay Hotel at 1 p.m. yesterday. More than 40 journalists from various countries attended, accompanied by former Foreign Ministers Gu Weijun and Wang Zhengting, and Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government. The gathering ended at 3 p.m. In his address, Mayor Wu stated: "I am deeply pleased to be gathered here with you today. There are two groups in Shanghai at present: one is the Japanese army that is invading Shanghai, and the other is the Chinese army that is protecting Shanghai. We know that Shanghai occupies an important position in the world economy. It is inexcusable that someone would destroy Shanghai, which holds such an important position. Since the outbreak of the war, countless innocent residents have been tragically sacrificed, numbering in the tens of thousands. All public and private buildings in the war zone have been destroyed by artillery fire. The losses are staggering, and this is only considering those directly affected by the war. The responsibility for these consequences rests entirely with the army that is invading Shanghai, and their actions are not tolerated by world humanity. The Chinese people love peace, as can be proven by our past history. However, when oppressed in this way, the Chinese people have no choice but to exercise their right to self-defense and resist. Since the beginning of the war, people from various countries, especially those in Shanghai, have upheld justice, revealed the truth to the world, and aroused public opinion. I, on behalf of the citizens of this city, express my gratitude. Furthermore, I must say that the Chinese people are currently under unreasonable and violent oppression and are prepared to make all sacrifices in order to achieve final peace. I firmly believe that justice and righteousness will surely obtain final victory."</p>

<p>Each Commander Raises it Once</p>
<p>Preparation Completed, Then Retraction</p>
<p>The *China Press* editorial today (the 29th) says: Judging from the events of the past five months, the politicians of Japan employ a strategy of negotiating with different intentions, making it difficult for us to believe deeply in the ceasefire proposal from Tokyo two days ago. Each time the Japanese army arrives in Shanghai or is about to arrive, the Tokyo government initiates a ceasefire movement. For example, Commander Ueda troubled the public of the four countries of Great Britain, the United States, France and Italy with his ceasefire proposal a week ago, while actively engaging in</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>preparations for a new attack. Once the preparations were completed, he issued an ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of the Chinese army, and ordered a general offensive, disregarding the peace efforts of the representatives of the four countries. Ueda's preparations for war took a week to complete. During this period, Ueda and his diplomatic colleagues were insincere and deceptive with the well-intentioned European and American representatives, preventing them from being on their guard. When Japan needed to send more reinforcements to China, the Tokyo government was bound to do something again to attract the world's attention with a peace proposal. When the reinforcements had all landed and the arrangements were complete, Japanese Commander-in-Chief General Shirakawa was likely to issue an ultimatum again, because Tokyo can always find an excuse to cancel its ceasefire proposal. According to news from Tokyo and Geneva, Japan is making another attempt at a ceasefire. Unfortunately, the details are unclear. However, we hope that the Japanese government, recognizing the complete hopelessness of the future, will make this proposal more sincere. The sincerity of Tokyo can only be determined by studying the full text of the peace terms. If the conditions are the same as those previously proposed by Ueda, then peace in Shanghai is still far away. If Japan is truly sincere about a ceasefire, the simplest method is to accept the five proposals previously put forward by the representatives of the four countries, which China has already accepted. The representatives of the four countries are fair and impartial. China has already accepted them. If Japan is truly sincere, why is it the only one that does not accept them? In the past, Japan rejected this proposal because it was confident that it could enter China peacefully without much force. Ueda's ten-day war should have made the Japanese government realize that conquering China by force is not as easy as its army staff had expected. If this Japanese peace proposal is a prelude to a change in Tokyo's China policy, then we hope that the Japanese authorities will show magnanimity and not be obsessed with preserving face and prestige, so as not to waste time and effort in vain. Alas! The public opinion of the world today sees hatred of Japan. Only statesmen with magnanimity can save Japan from its doom. Yesterday, large numbers of</p>

<p>The [Suggestion of Bondholders for a Low-Interest Extension&gt;</p>
<p>The National Public Debt Treasury Bill Holders Association of the Republic of China telegraphed the government authorities yesterday, Mr. Lin, Chairman of the Luoyang National Government, Mr. Wang, President of the Executive Yuan, and Mr. Song, Minister of Finance: The Japanese broke the League of Nations Charter, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Non-Aggression Pact, occupied our Northeast Three Provinces, and disturbed Tianjin, Jiaozhou, Shantou, and Beijing. It also used the Shanghai Public Concession as an operational base and attacked our Zhabei garrison on the evening of January 28, turning our country's economic center and the hub of Sino-foreign trade into ashes with artillery fire and machine gun fire. Hospitals, libraries, and disaster relief shelters were all affected by the disaster, and they committed all kinds of atrocities, including rape and looting. Fortunately, our Nineteenth Route and other national armies abided by the National Government's order to defend the territory and maintain the prestige of the charter pact and the League of Nations, adopted proper self-defense, and fought hard for a month. The crimes of the Japanese have been exposed to the world. The Japanese are still incorrigible and sending large troops, as if the pact chapter must be turned into waste paper, as if the League of Nations must be broken from now on. The prosperity that Chinese and foreign businessmen in Shanghai have worked hard to create for 88 years must be destroyed. Under this situation, our country has the task of maintaining world peace and must make active preparations to resist the Japanese. The way to prepare is not just one aspect, and wartime finance should be planned in the long term. In order to issue an order as a group of domestic public debt treasury bill holders, when this country is in trouble, weigh it again and again, and the national credit must not be lost, and the burden of compatriots must not be ignored. Therefore, reduce the interest rate on bonds and extend the principal repayment period, which can free up funds to meet the needs of the war, and can avoid issuing war bonds to reduce the burden on compatriots, and do what is right. It is not allowed to retreat when benevolence is indispensable. Please start with Wei, and use the declaration of declaration and the draft method, and the draft regulations of the proposed national debt fund management committee, each with a copy, special telecast to Chen Yangqi to observe and implement, and it is not invincible. The National Public Debt Treasury Bill Holders of the Republic of China kowtow together,</p>

<p>Today, Gu Weijun and Japanese Navy Commander Nomura met on the British cruiser *Kent*, chaired by British Navy Commander Kelley, to discuss the Shanghai ceasefire. However, it was heard that the meeting did not yield any results, because the Japanese side still insisted on the original proposal for the Chinese army to withdraw 20 kilometers and to dismantle the Wusong and Shizilin forts. It is now hoped that the peace talks can continue in the next few days, with the participation of British Ambassador Lampson and the Japanese army authorities. Mayor Wu and other Chinese authorities have expressed distrust of the Japanese proposals.</p>

<p>Dead Soldiers Pile Up at the Pier A man who returned from the Huishan Pier yesterday said that a large number of burlap sacks covered with oilcloth were piled up like mountains on the pier. At first, it was thought to be military uniforms, but then someone went to see them and found that they were filled with the corpses of Japanese soldiers, with as many as eight or nine hundred bags. When they went to see them, they were driven away by Japanese soldiers with guns. It was estimated that they were waiting for the ship to load them. However, there were no dead soldiers the day before yesterday, and it was obvious that they had been moved from the position yesterday, which shows the heavy casualties.</p>

<p>Škoda Factory Did Not Sell Poison Gas Bombs</p>
<p>The Czechoslovak Legation in Shanghai, upon instruction from its government, yesterday issued a statement that the Škoda factory has not supplied any war materials to Japan, and that the factory does not manufacture poison gas bombs. Therefore, the news recently published in Shanghai newspapers that the Czech factory had entered into a contract with Japan to supply poison gas bombs and powerful explosive bombs is a rumor and without foundation. Furthermore, a letter from the Far East manager of the Škoda factory states that the Huitong Telegraph Agency issued a dispatch from Paris on February 26, claiming that the Škoda factory had sold poison gas shells and other items to Japan. The manager immediately telegraphed the head office in Prague for details. The reply from the 27th stated that the Huitong Telegraph Agency's report that the factory had undertaken to manufacture a large quantity of war materials, poison gas shells, etc., was completely unfounded and that the factory had not received any orders for war materials from Japan. These rumors were spread entirely by communist elements, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Czechoslovakia will formally deny them. Please publish this information in your newspaper.</p>

<p>Following the publication in various newspapers of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese staff's initiative to donate five percent (previously incorrectly reported as five per mille) of their salaries, many Chinese staff members from various companies and foreign firms in Shanghai have been inquiring about the details. According to the Council's Chinese staff, the current five-percent donation is calculated as a percentage, meaning that those with a monthly salary of fifty yuan donate two yuan and fifty cents per month, those with a hundred yuan donate five yuan per month, and so on proportionally. The method is that responsible personnel in each department collect the donations at the end of each month. It is reported that collection began in March, and the total amount is expected to be several thousand yuan.</p>

It is reported that the union fears misunderstandings among a few members, so it has sent a letter to the Municipal People's Local Maintenance Association requesting that it provide effective assistance and supervision to ensure the implementation.</p>

<p>Mr. Mu Ouchu's letter reads: To the Shen Bao newspaper office: Regarding the report about my proposal at the Standing Committee meeting of the Red Cross Society, there are some omissions. My opinion is: (1) There should be a centralized location for wounded soldiers, and all wounded soldiers' hospitals should communicate with each other to share information about the number of available beds, so that wounded soldiers can be sent there to avoid delays and problems along the way. (2) The 19th Route Army should send a senior officer to inspect each hospital daily and transfer soldiers who are recovering to rear hospitals to free up more beds and improve treatment efficiency. As for the request for generous donations from enthusiastic philanthropists, it was not my proposal. I am making this correction to ensure accuracy.</p>

<p>Someone Has Already Donated Money for Funeral Expenses</p>
<p>All Sectors Should Quickly Support This Cause</p>
<p>Martyr Hu Amao, a chauffeur, was forced by the Japanese army the day before yesterday to drive a truck loaded with ammunition to the Gongda Textile Factory. Martyr Hu pretended to agree and, when the truck reached its destination, accelerated towards the Huangpu River. In an instant, the waves splashed, and both the man and the vehicle disappeared. Mr. Hu's hatred of the Japanese and his sacrifice to serve the country are truly admirable. However, he has an elderly mother, and his family is in dire straits. This newspaper has already reported that Mr. Hu sacrificed himself for the country and that all sectors are willing to provide generous compensation and condolence. It is reported that the colleagues of Xiaobuzhai donated twenty yuan and entrusted Mr. Yang Chonggao and Mr. Zhao Hanying of the China Vocational Education Society to forward it and investigate the situation of Mr. Hu's family in order to widely solicit donations. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all sectors will advocate and support donations to comfort the loyal martyr.

I greatly admire him. However, since Amao was willing to sacrifice himself for the country, it is a great pity that his family is impoverished and his elderly mother has no support. It would be best if enthusiastic people from all sectors could raise silver dollars and give them to his mother for her living expenses, so that the deceased has no worries and the successors have hope for the future. I am writing to your esteemed newspaper in the hope that you will consider and take action. If it can be realized, I will contribute as much as I can to encourage others. Zhu Xi, February 28.</p>

Maddie Motor Company was founded by the American Mr. Maddie and has been operating in Shanghai for many years, with a wide scope and great benefit to China's transportation industry. Moreover, Americans have a deep friendship with the Chinese people, so the company would never prepare trucks and install military equipment for the enemy. Furthermore, according to Maddie Company's letter, the reports in yesterday's newspapers that the company was installing gasoline tanks and pumps for the Japanese are also completely unfounded.</p>

Recently, the colleagues of Xiaobuzhai purchased cotton quilts and distributed them to hospitals, only to discover that the cotton used was old, recycled cotton. This kind of worn-out cotton not only has no warmth but is also very dirty and full of germs. It is easy for refugees to contract diseases from it, and it is even more difficult for the wounds of soldiers to heal.

<h3 id="e57">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor, Recently, various newspapers have reported that the conflict between Japan and Russia is becoming increasingly apparent, with the Japanese recruiting White Russians to prepare to invade the Russian border, and Russia increasing troops at the border. Those in our country who do not understand international affairs believe that the outbreak of war between Japan and Russia is possible. However, I believe that these news reports are all part of Japan's counter-propaganda tactics and are not true. Our country's news media must not be deceived by its intentions and publish such reports, which would shift the attention of Europeans and Americans away from the current state of the war in Shanghai. At the beginning of Japan's seizure of our Northeast provinces, it already made declarations to the international community, saying that Russia's five-year plan would soon be completed and that all countries in the world would suffer. Only Japan could contain it, but it had to have Manchuria as its base in order to find a solid and lasting foothold. At that time, the major powers were anxious about the spread of the Red Peril and lacked effective solutions. Hearing Japan's proposal, which met their needs, they did not lack understanding and support for Japan's advance into Manchuria. Therefore, my country's Ambassador Shi repeatedly appealed to the League of Nations, but without any effect. Who knew that Japan would become increasingly greedy? Seeing that the momentum of resistance in the Yangtze River area was growing day by day, breaking the record of "five minutes of enthusiasm," and that the goods of Britain and America were selling better as a result, Japan, out of jealousy and anger, did not hesitate to find ways to destroy it and make a desperate gamble. Even if it failed, it could bring Chinese and foreign businesses to ruin. If it succeeded, it could monopolize the commercial hegemony of my Yangtze River. The major powers then began to feel that they had been fooled by Japan, and at the same time, the news of a Japanese-Russian understanding was spread internationally. Therefore, the diplomatic policies of the major powers had to be changed accordingly, and international public opinion also gradually changed. Japan, knowing that the international situation was unfavorable, colluded with Russia and fabricated news such as Japanese-Russian conflicts, Japanese recruitment of White Russians, and Russia increasing troops at the border, hoping to shift the attention of European and American countries and ease the world's righteous indignation towards the war in Shanghai. Its diplomatic tactics are truly unparalleled in the world. It is important to know that Russia will not take any military action that would hinder its development until its five-year plan is completed. What it hopes for is the prolonged war between China and Japan, with each side exhausted, so that its communism can be spread in a leisurely manner. (The Japanese should realize this urgently, and our people should remain steadfast.) As for Japan's recruitment of White Russians to form an army, it is because its own troops in Shanghai have suffered too many casualties, so it has no choice but to rely on White Russians to make up for its military deficiencies, not to invade Russia. The news of Japan's transportation of White Russians to Shanghai these days is sufficient to prove this. It is hoped that patriotic people will correct this at any time to avoid falling into Japan's trap, which will greatly benefit our war effort against Japan. Lu Zhongliang, February 28.</p>

Foreign Minister Luo replied that China could accept this, but only if China and Japan withdrew simultaneously. He also said that if Japan maintained the conditions of its previous ultimatum, it would absolutely not be acceptable.

They did not leave until after talking for an hour. It is reported that the British, American, and French envoys have exchanged views several times with the Japanese envoy Shigemitsu Aoi in Shanghai on mediating the Shanghai Incident.

<p>A Secret Memorandum from the Japanese Government</p>
<p>Changes the Atmosphere in Geneva</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese government has sent a confidential memorandum to the twelve members of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Its main points are to convene a round table conference in Shanghai, with special attention to protecting foreigners. All relevant countries should send representatives to the meeting. The memorandum details the reasons for the Japanese military operations in Shanghai, stating that once the Chinese army makes a substantial withdrawal to ensure the safety and tranquility of Shanghai, the Japanese government is willing to cooperate with the great powers to handle the overall situation. Japan does not want to use the current situation to realize any political ambitions or establish a Japanese concession in Shanghai. Japan fully trusts the Shanghai Municipal Council's administration and is willing</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>to maintain and consolidate the international character of Shanghai. The document also denies the Japanese proposal for neutral zones in major Chinese ports. It is said that Matsudaira and Sato have both orally supplemented Japan's willingness to achieve a ceasefire. There is a possibility that the special session of the League of Nations Assembly on March 3rd may be postponed. This is because when Thorley is conducting ceasefire talks with both China and Japan in Shanghai, details are confidential. If representatives of various countries are allowed to freely express their opinions on the Sino-Japanese dispute at the League of Nations Assembly, it will not be sufficient to find a solution. British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon is very active in this regard and discussed everything with League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond this morning. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The focus of diplomacy has now shifted to Shanghai. The success or failure of Japan's attempt at a ceasefire depends on the negotiators there. Therefore, Geneva is now awaiting the results of this move. The date of the next administrative council meeting of the twelve members has not yet been determined. French Prime Minister Tardieu arrived here this morning, but must return to Paris tonight. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Material preparations for the special session of the League of Nations Assembly have been completed. Its first meeting will be held on Thursday morning. Since the Disarmament Conference is already in session, representatives from various countries are already in Geneva, so convening the meeting is very easy, and the venue can also be used for both meetings. Political preparations are also underway. The reason why the chief French representative to the Disarmament Conference, Tardieu, hurriedly returned to Paris is for the purpose of the Far Eastern issue. Tardieu will meet with the British representative Simon this afternoon to discuss all possible matters in detail. Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans, who was the chairman of the League of Nations' Sixth Committee, is highly regarded. This time, he does not need to be elected and can be unanimously appointed. As for the Hungarian representative, Count Apponyi, he will fully step aside. The chairman of the Administrative Council, Paul Hymans, will today convene the eleven colleagues other than the representatives of China and Japan to study the Shanghai situation and discuss solutions to improve the Far Eastern situation at the special session of the League of Nations Assembly to be convened soon. This morning, Simon's meeting with League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond was also on the same matter. In short, with the special session of the Assembly just around the corner, all parties are redoubling their efforts to end or at least temporarily suspend the Sino-Japanese dispute. This is undeniable. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Prime Minister Tardieu arrived here this morning and immediately met with the chairman of the Administrative Council, Paul Hymans, with particular emphasis on the Far East events and the situation of the special session of the League of Nations Assembly. He then joined Paul Hymans in meeting with German representative Nadolny and Czech representative Beneš, and had lunch with the Belgian representative Charles de Broqueville. Paul Hymans also met with the American Minister to Switzerland, Davis, in the morning. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>But Internal Opinions Are Not Yet Unified</p>
<p>(Washington) According to today's news, the US government does not support sanctions against Japan, but the authorities clearly have not reached a unified opinion on this issue. President Hoover and people in the government and Congress mostly do not consider sanctions to be appropriate. American inspectors in Europe have also notified the State Department that the major European powers agree with the US attitude. American officials have mentioned Japan's new proposal for a ceasefire, saying that the United States will not recognize any results that Japan obtains in Shanghai or Manchuria in violation of existing treaties. Senior US officials believe that sanctions could easily lead to war and halt the industry of all countries involved. It is said that Secretary of State Stimson sent copies of his January 7th memorandum to Japan to European countries on President Hoover's orders. This memorandum cites the Nine-Power Treaty and notifies Japan that the United States cannot recognize the legitimacy of any de facto situation, nor can it recognize any treaty between China and Japan that infringes upon the treaty rights of the United States or its people.

Although there is still no news about the outcome of the talks, Reuters has learned from well-placed sources that substantial progress has been made, which may lead to an understanding between the opposing sides. It is generally believed that Japanese reinforcements have arrived in Shanghai and that the League of Nations Assembly is about to open, so both sides feel the need for a ceasefire to prevent the conflict from expanding. Therefore, it is now believed that the talks on HMS Kent will focus on a ceasefire and its terms. The talks on the ship are expected to continue tomorrow.

<p>Conflict with Japan Sooner or Later Unavoidable</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the Soviet Union has two army corps gathered around Vladivostok, and there are about 100,000 soldiers in the Ussuri region. This number is contained in a report from the Japanese consul in the relevant area, which is said to have been obtained from reliable foreign sources. These troops have been arriving continuously from European Russia since last December. The consul also said that food and ammunition are being transported non-stop day and night. A new fort is being rushed to construction in the Xidanka area of Amur Bay. Another report states that a pigment factory in Volga Bay has been converted into a poison gas factory. The Ussuri Railway is now guarded by Communist volunteer soldiers. The intention of this movement is unclear, but according to the consul's report, Russians generally believe that Russia will sooner or later clash with Japan over the Asian problem or the Kamchatka fisheries issue. Russians even say that "the Japanese are as hateful as cholera germs." (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>Says the Shanghai Situation Should Be Allowed to End Naturally</p>
<p>London Leading British figures such as Churchill and Eden published a letter in The Times on the 18th of this month, discussing the Shanghai affair. They pointed out that Japan's military dictatorship in the Far East would have adverse effects on India and the British Empire, and advocated that Britain should seek cooperation with the United States. The League of Nations should use diplomatic and economic pressure to force Japan to respect the collective system of dignified conditions. Churchill also gave a speech on Saturday, calling on the League of Nations, with the support of the United States, to formally order a ceasefire and establish neutral zones. This morning, the Morning Post and the Daily Telegraph both published articles criticizing Churchill's attitude. The Morning Post stated, "We oppose such threats and arbitrariness in the name of peace and dignified conditions. If Japan is truly wrong, then the first step should be to expel Japan and return the occupied land to China. If China is right, then other countries should not use Chinese land as neutral territory, just as Japan should not invade China. But it is a pity that China has banditry and other problems, which force other countries to take forceful action." The Daily Telegraph said that if the rumored Japanese ceasefire terms include withdrawing troops under the supervision of a committee and convening a round table conference, then it is hoped that the Nanjing government will accept them. Japan's reason for these conditions is the remarkable courage of the Chinese army and the unrest caused by this in Tokyo. If busybodies like Churchill do not keep interfering, then events will have their natural ending. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>The Times Comments on the Japanese Military's Miscalculations in Invading Shanghai</p>
<p>London The Sunday Times, which can be described as a newspaper that publishes the opinions of the authorities, today strongly criticized Japan's policy regarding the Shanghai case, saying that Japan's actions are likely to lead to its own failure. The newspaper expressed regret for the loss of life, property, and war expenses in this war, and then stated that the sharp decline of Japanese currency has worsened Japan's economic position, and banks have found it difficult to cope. The impact of this on Japanese industry and commerce will become increasingly serious. All of these factors, in the eyes of other countries in the world, are enough to expose the miscalculations of the Japanese military clique. Therefore, although the current situation is dangerous, there is still hope. (Special dispatch from the China Press on the 28th)</p>

Tram workers are very angry and have presented the company with conditions such as increased wages and improved treatment.

The workers were furious and jointly refused to collect their salaries together with the electric light workers. They decided to send representatives to visit Mayor Zhou at 10 AM on the 1st to ask him to announce his attitude towards the tram fare increase. If the fare increase can be stopped, the workers will take free action. At the same time, they warned the company to wake up. The water strike entered its first day on the 29th, and the company's ability to function is still being undermined. The municipal party headquarters held a meeting to mediate at 2 PM, but no representatives from the management side attended, so the meeting was fruitless.
