<p>時評</p>
<h3>請軍縮會議代表遙聆上海炮聲彬</h3>
<p>自去年九一八日本突然實力發動攻取我東北而後。和平寗寂之太平洋上。即頓時爲恐怖之陰霾所籠罩。國際聯盟高揭維護和平與正義之旗幟。前後四次集會。終無以制止日人之暴行。其徒爲欺騙弱國之糖果。蓋早已爲國際人士所灼知目前上海禍變爆發。深重之恐怖。且日向悲慘之前途。推移擴大。際此嚴重之時期。而列强乃復依據國際聯盟之規約。舉行軍縮會議於日内瓦。集議裁縮軍備。上海方面。正砲火連天顯然正積極進行極盡人寰慘事之屠戮。而日内瓦方面軍縮會議之代表。則正雍容集會。典雅發言。苦慮焦思進行其所謂軍備之裁縮。上海日軍之砲聲。炸彈聲。與日内瓦會議集上之發言。遙相應和。世間之滑稽事。寗尚朋逾於此者。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表李維諾夫在會議上曾有言。「當大會開幕之時。適値兩國砲聲隆隆。而此兩國者皆受國聯會章與巴黎非戰公約之約束。近五月來已有實在的戰爭狀態存在。一國之廣大土地。已爲另一國之軍隊佔據戰事現尚在</p>
<p>進行中。且用及各種武器。死傷者已達數千人。誰能言因此開始之軍事活動。僅限於此兩國或一大陸乎。」李氏之言。蓋已將軍縮會議之虚僞與列國代表之賣弄其手段。揭露無遺。在此無情之揭露下。世界人士應可灼知彼出席軍縮會議之列國代表。其所鈎心鬥角焦慮苦思者。非爲軍縮而實爲求勢力之均等。暫時彌縫其相互間之矛盾與裂痕。質言之。即恰爲準備并醖釀將來更殘酷更廣大之屠殺耳。</p>
<p>日本一手撕碎國際盟約。一手破壞世界和平。暴戾恣睢。目無世界。而其出席軍縮會議之代表。則多至九十人。此九十人者。固爲維護和平而出席耶。抑别有用意耶。</p>
<p>吾人認爲世界列國。如有維護和平之誠意。則請不作高論。第一即應以緊急有效之方法。制止日軍暴行。并維護中國行政領土主權之完整。次乃足以言縮軍。乃足以言維護和平。否則繼此滑稽喜劇最後一幕而呈現於世人眼前者。必爲一幕絕世之悲劇。此悲劇今已在遠東開始其序幕矣。吾人敢聲請軍縮會議代表。其速從我顔代表言。暫停滔滔之雄辯。而一遙聆上海轟轟之砲聲。</p>

<h3>初次偷渡失敗</h3>
<p>昨日、敵三次架搭浮橋竹筏、希圖偷渡蕰藻浜、及南泗塘河、第一次在昨晨四時半許、天方破曉之際、敵兵二百餘名、在黑橋之東偷渡、當被我防軍覺察、即用機關槍迫擊砲掃射、敵遺屍十餘具、棄筏而逸、</p>
<h3>敵施放烟幕彈第二次在昨</h3>
<p>晨七時許、有敵兵三四百名、各手持刀鈎鋸斧等、在南草菴前偷渡、敵軍並發烟幕彈、至我軍陣地、一時蕰藻浜上白烟迷漫、我軍察知奸計、即向依周塘角、用機關槍數架掃射、及至白烟消散、則已無敵踪、第三次在上午十時許、時方雪花紛飛、敵一千餘人、仍藉烟幕彈之掩護、又圖偷渡、當被我軍步哨發覺時、當即飛報後方、調大隊應戰、同時敵以極迅速之進行、全部偷渡登陸、我軍遂與激戰、一時肉搏甚烈、戰至十二時我援軍趕到、遂將敵全部大包圍、至昨日下午四時止、仍在包圍中、當曹家橋兩軍激戰敵正擬後退時、敵軍另派支隊約三百餘人、攻擊紀家橋、我軍即出而應戰、雙方相持、約一小時之久、敵軍不支而退、至十時許、日又以五百餘人、用手提機關槍等猛衝、我軍以機關槍及排槍等應戰、敵軍因雨雪、不能用鐵甲車爲前導、故死傷頗多、至十時十五分即退、繼敵軍以少數步隊、攻侯家木橋、我軍沉着應戰、敵軍以爲有機可乘、遂增兵力前進、我軍乃以機關槍掃射、敵知中計、乃倉皇退却云、</p>
<h3>敵增兵張華浜</h3>
<p>昨日下午二</p>
<p>時、敵軍在張華浜兩路工廠附近、用重砲向我軍陣地轟擊、彈均落吳淞市河兩岸及同濟路泰興路一帶、我軍殊少損傷、雖敵砲亂轟、我軍異常鎭靜、絕不還擊、昨據張華浜對江防疫醫院附近之鄉民稱、前日自晨至暮、瞥見有小輪拖帶大鐵壳駁船四艘、滿載敵兵、自滬駛至張華浜登岸、輪駁待敵兵起岸後、即向滬駛回、復裝載敵兵來淞、如是者有四次之多、最後一次、曾見有大砲數門、駁運上岸、復見軍工路上卡車、來往頗忙、均滿載敵兵、及軍火而來、空車而去、照此情形觀察、現在張華浜之敵軍人數、已較前大增、</p>
<h3>戰區實地視察字林報云、</h3>
<p>昨（十二）日上午八時至十二時間、記者往張華浜以北一帶實地視察、見吳淞全鎭、蕩爲瓦礫、同濟大學内亦有三大厦毀於砲火、無可修復、其餘敎職房屋九所中、現八所爲兵士駐守、該校敎職員昨日午前曾往取出珍貴儀器若干、惟吳淞並未在停戰區域、記者周覽鎭内、兵燹各處時、槍聲未絕、嗣以砲火太猛、安全可虞、擬取道往砲臺飯店、乃子彈直向記者飛來、不得已遂急離戰區而歸、目下吳淞一鎭、已爲砲彈與大火、燬去大半、由市鎭往</p>
<p>砲臺之大道中、亦復斷垣殘壁、遍地瓦礫、行人須攀越而過、公私房屋、其倖存者、莫不彈孔纍纍、有若蜂窠、沿江大道、則有駐兵堆積沙袋及防禦物、在彼扼守、就記者所確知者、此時吳淞砲臺、仍在中國軍隊之守、屹然無恙、而砲臺飯店旗桿上亦仍有英國旗懸掛、同濟校舍損害最甚、大砲彈横貫解剖室、所過處無不摧毀、即窗户亦罕有存者、其儀器及記錄之損失、無價可估、工程館與科學館亦損壞殊甚、又有一飛機所擲炸彈、爆發於校内曠塲中央、某敎授至其藏書室、目擊珍貴書籍與價値五千餘元之儀器破殘不堪、竟爲之埀涙、其寓所在數百碼外、亦爲另一砲彈所毀、此次在刧灰中所檢得者、祗足供其重起爐竈之資而已、當諸西人離校後、校役扃門時、德國旗固猶招颭於旗凱旋路上英國軍官（李尊庸攝）</p>
<p>桿之上也、自瀏河至吳淞一帶、記者昨日沿途所見、中國兵土已不若四日前之衆、大約皆隱藏於可以障身地方、即所見兵土、亦多在工作、絕少空閒者、因此記者可獲見數百碼新掘之新式濠溝、僅距眞茹路工哩内、有橋四座、皆見有兵士多人駐守、至於曠野地方、絕少兵士踪跡、橋端除安設機關槍外、兵士手中有携自働來復槍、及手霰彈者亦、有携米爾式炸彈者、其他兵士防守地方、則外面皆以他物掩飾、絕不易爲人覺察、大路之外、亦可在遠處見有同樣濠溝、惟中國軍隊似恃河浜池澤等天險扼守、未曾再以人力設法鞏固此天然防禦物、蓋其地易於扼守、無論何種軍隊、欲圖進佔、必將受重大損失也、</p>
<h3>閘北激戰狀况</h3>
<p>擊落敵機一架　　彈落日司令部　　敵軍死傷極衆　　昨天（十三日）閘北方面、日軍因前晚（十二日）進攻失利、乃重調生力軍、至前線補充、於昨晨八時許下令、續向我軍防線總攻、於是虬江路·天通庵路·新民路·青雲路·又復先後發生激戰、同時日飛機八架、飛行天空助戰、並擲巨量炸彈五枚、落在麥根路區及湖州會館内、較輕炸彈、約有五十餘枚、間以大砲、我軍奮勇還擊、並用高射砲轟擊日機、在相距二十碼處即炸裂、因此日機紛紛逃避、折向眞茹投彈、約十餘起、未得逞、又被我軍用高射砲擊回、中有一機、被我軍擊落、前日下午六時、我軍砲隊開砲、擊中北四川路底日兵陸戰隊本部、轟燬房屋數座、並斃敵軍少校參謀一人、敵兵數人、昨晨六時許、我軍砲隊又擊中日童公學内日兵第二司令部·茲將各情紀述如次、</p>
<h3>日兵總攻閘北昨晨八時許、</h3>
<p>日兵千餘名、利用飛機擲彈·大砲掩護·及後方生力軍之補充、又向虬江路·新民路·天通庵路·青雲路等處我軍前哨綫總攻、當時雨雪紛飛、我軍即在雪中奮起抵禦、雙方各用野戰砲·鋼砲·機關槍·掩護掃射、日飛機亦出助戰、希圖擾亂我軍後方、未幾即被我軍高射砲擊退、我前綫各將士、在敵陣中衝入殺出者數次、至十時許、敵軍不支潰退、我軍防綫、堅如鐵壁、僅二十餘人受傷、日兵傷亡甚鉅、嗣後晤及該師某旅參謀長、據談日軍今晨（即昨晨）之戰、意圖擾亂我軍陣線、惟若輩均甚怕死、向我作戰時、士氣甚餒、且多藉利器掩護、結果均被我軍擊退、現我軍對於最前線防務、甚爲鞏固、日軍殊難越雷池一步云云、</p>
<h3>彈落日司令部昨晨劇戰時</h3>
<p>、雙方砲轟之烈、爲發生戰事後之第一次、自晨八時至晚九時、未曾間斷、日兵以轟炸閘北一帶民房爲目標、但均中途墮落、或在租界内爆炸、我軍砲隊則發砲準確、百無一失、北四川路底日海軍陸戰隊司令部、曾於前日）十二日（下午六時、被我軍砲隊開砲擊中、燬去房屋一座、斃日兵少校參謀一人、傷敵兵數人、昨晨）十三日（日兵設在北四川路横浜橋日童公學内之第二司令部、又被我軍擊中爆裂、死傷纍纍地上血跡甚多得逃生者無幾、嗣後日兵砲轟漸稀、至晚九時後始息</p>
<h3>大批日屍運回昨日下午兩</h3>
<p>時許、訪員行經北市外白渡橋、目睹有卡車九輛、均滿載日軍屍身、約計一千餘具、俱盛以蔴袋、鮮紅血液、從蔴袋縫中汨汨流出、由北四川路方面馳來、至該處日本領事館門首停駐、即由押運之日軍、手携手提機關槍、迫令華人、將此項蔴袋、逐一從卡車上般下、分别扛運、至該處附近堆棧内堆存、聞扛運之華人、純係虹口一帶居民、陸續爲日軍擄去者、充作是項苦工、訪員目睹若輩精神衰頽、形容憔悴、其内不少智識階級中人、當扛運此種日軍屍首時、有日軍執槍在旁、監視甚嚴、中有一人、因稍爲倔强、輙遭日軍槍殺、日軍此種舉動實屬慘無人道、</p>
<h3>湖州會館被毀昨日上午七</h3>
<p>時起、日兵又用重砲、向我閘北會文路湖州會館猛轟、該館房屋、前曾被飛機擲彈炸燬極多、所存僅丙舍一部分、尚未燬壞、不料昨日、敵軍復用巨砲轟擊、砲彈橫飛、結果、所有丙房、盡被轟毀、柩内屍體、中彈後、有斷頭·缺臂·破腹·裂背·者、均骸骨橫飛、所有紅綠殮衣、盡成砲灰、其餘各處、爲流彈炸毁者亦甚夥、蓋目下敵軍、所用砲彈皆係開花彈、故凡經着彈之處、莫不毁壞殆盡云</p>
<h3>天通菴之激戰</h3>
<p>記者昨十三日）在醫院中晤及傷兵蔣桂林、據述前晚（十二日）在天通菴抵抗敵軍一幕、略謂、予湘省人、一月前在贛從戎、投效六十師、甫經匝月、充副班長職、昨晚余等正扼守天通菴路、我軍派有步哨、我等均抱定敵不來則已、來則必與抵抗、不料至七時、敵即開砲向我猛轟、我軍毫不理睬、聽其消耗子彈、然敵竟越轟越密、經兩小時之久、並不停止、當且派出二百餘敵軍、向我防地衝來、在下午七時一刻、先與我哨兵衝突、將近我防禦物時、我軍突起還擊、並用槍掃射、撲殺敵人約五十餘名、連戰約一刻鐘、我等見敵已餒、且露有不支欲退之勢、因又想及敵來係越浜前進、退時亦須過浜、較諸平原退兵、總屬不易、於是即竭全力衝出、與之應戰、手溜彈炸裂聲不絕於耳、迨敵完全退過浜南、似已大爲狼狽、且此時擊斃於浜中敵人、又增二十餘名、余乃於衝出之時、足部受傷、即由救護者舁至團部、（時正十一時半、俟至天明、（即昨晨）始轉投醫院療治、當午夜十二時、余在團部、聞得報告、敵軍二百餘生還僅及半數、因敵主攻我主守、故敵傷亡甚大、我方僅傷亡十餘人、至當晚十二以後、槍砲聲始逐漸稀落云、</p>
<h3>我軍人格高尚</h3>
<p>據自前綫視察歸來者談、前日敵軍偷襲吳淞時、被我軍士兵截獲、中有日兵數人繳械後、伏地求釋、我方士兵、見其已失戰鬥能力、且卑劣可憐、即予放回、並向之云、「你去拿了槍再來受死吧、」日兵即狼狽鼠竄而去、我軍之正直剛强、於此可見一斑、而日軍對於我方士兵、一被截獲、即加屠戳、每遇傷兵呻吟地上者、亦必以槍刺猛戳數下、令其宛轉以斃、其慘酷行爲、實爲人道所不許、外人對此、莫不憤憤不平、而稱道我軍人格不置云、</p>
<h3>昨日日本炸彈肆虐</h3>
<p>專害平民　　擾及租界日宼犯滬、無戰不敗、其唯一洩憤之伎倆、在用飛機及便衣隊、向我無戰鬭力之平民抛擲炸彈、名之日擾亂後方、究不知其效用於戰事者幾何、徒見其慘酷無人道耳、其最可注意者、對於租界區内、亦頻擲炸彈、似故意與租界當局爲難者、茲將昨日關於炸彈之情形、分錄如左、</p>
<h3>眞茹方面</h3>

<h3>日人盛稱我軍勇敢</h3>
<p>砲彈意外正確　　戰術非常奇妙　　日中隊長自殺　　大阪每日　聞六日載戰事消息云、敵（指我軍下同）之野砲隊之射擊、意外正確（照日文直譯）我（指日軍下同）陸戰隊本部、數日來中敵方砲彈十餘發、而我軍因不慣於巷戰、遂遭極大的犧牲、且敵嘗以機關槍向我軍裝甲車之前衝鋒、我若亂射則敵軍沉默、而我軍以爲可放心前進、敵乃乘機衝出、又中其計、此種奇妙戰術、不敵戰法、我軍嘗出大部分之死傷者、（均照日文直譯由此足徵敵膽已寒直供不諱記者又查此次戰爭日軍中之死傷者如水雷長航海長隊長艦長等不下四五十人而我方下級軍官受傷者不過一二人）又時事新聞云、最可驚者、我陸戰隊本部指揮官室内屋頂、突然落下敵之八珊砲彈、徼幸萬分、彈竟不炸、否則、我陸戰隊　首腦部長官、必遭全滅、此亦天佑我軍、然而各長官、已驚駭失色、呆若木雞矣、</p>

<p>日文報又載電通上海二日專電云、中隊長米丸大尉、於今晨三時、以軍刀刺胸自戕、留下遺書一封、内有促鹽澤司令决斷與猛省、挽回失敗之名譽」云云、此所以有鹽澤自殺之誤傳也、</p>

<h3>Please let the Military Disarmament Conference Representatives Listen Remotely to the Sounds of the Cannons of Shanghai Bin</h3>
<p>Since the sudden launch of a military attack by Japan on our Northeast on September 18th of last year, peace and tranquility on the Pacific Ocean were immediately enveloped in a cloud of terror. The League of Nations, holding high the banner of maintaining peace and justice, convened four meetings, but ultimately failed to stop Japan's atrocities. The candies that it used to deceive weak nations were already well known by international figures. Currently, the Shanghai disaster has erupted, causing profound terror, and the dire future is expanding and escalating. At this critical juncture, the great powers are once again convening a military disarmament conference in Geneva based on the covenants of the League of Nations, to discuss and cut back on armaments. In Shanghai, the roar of cannons fills the air, clearly indicating the active perpetration of massacres that push the boundaries of human tragedy. Meanwhile, in Geneva, the representatives at the military disarmament conference are leisurely gathering and eloquently speaking, racking their brains and pondering the so-called reduction of armaments. The sound of Japanese cannons and bombs in Shanghai echoes distantly with the speeches at the Geneva conference. Could there be a more farcical scene in the world?</p>
<p>Soviet representative Litvinov stated at the conference, "As the assembly opens, it coincides with the loud sound of cannons from two countries, both bound by the covenant of the League of Nations and the Pact of Paris. For nearly five months, a state of actual war has existed. The vast territory of one country has been occupied by the troops of another. The war is still ongoing, with the use of various weapons, and the casualties have already reached thousands. Who can say that the military activities that have begun will be limited to these two countries or one continent?" Litvinov's words have thoroughly exposed the hypocrisy of the disarmament conference and the maneuvering of the representatives of various countries. Under this ruthless exposure, people around the world should clearly understand that the representatives of the countries attending the disarmament conference are not actually striving for disarmament, but rather for the equality of power, temporarily patching up their mutual contradictions and rifts. In short, they are precisely preparing and brewing for a more cruel and larger massacre in the future.</p>
<p>Japan tears up international covenants with one hand and destroys world peace with the other, acting violently and disregarding the world. Yet, its representatives attending the disarmament conference number as many as ninety. Are these ninety people attending to maintain peace, or do they have other intentions?</p>
<p>We believe that if the countries of the world have the sincere intention of maintaining peace, they should refrain from lofty rhetoric. Firstly, they should adopt urgent and effective measures to stop the atrocities of the Japanese army and safeguard the integrity of China's administrative territory and sovereignty. Only then can they speak of disarmament and maintaining peace. Otherwise, what will be presented to the world after the last scene of this farcical comedy will be an unparalleled tragedy. This tragedy has already begun its prelude in the Far East. We dare to request that the representatives of the military disarmament conference quickly heed the words of our Yan representative, suspend their eloquent speeches, and instead listen remotely to the booming cannons of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Great Victory for Our Army in the Bloody Battle of Wenzaobang</h3>
<p>The enemy army that attempted to cross the Caojiaqiao was completely annihilated. Both Japanese command headquarters in Hongkou were hit by bombs. Our army's morale is high, and the front line is more stable.</p>
<h3>All Enemy Troops that Attempted to Cross Were Annihilated</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, over a thousand enemy troops attempting to cross were surrounded, and a bloody battle lasted for twelve hours. All enemy troops were annihilated without a single survivor. This newspaper's latest news this morning: At around 10:00 AM yesterday, over a thousand enemy soldiers from the army, under the cover of smoke bombs for the third time, managed to sneak across the Wenzaobang River and landed on the north bank at Caojiaqiao. The situation was extremely tense at the time. The enemy troops, with a determination to die, launched an all-out assault on our defense line. Our army fought bravely and urgently dispatched reinforcements from the rear to join the battle, forming a large encirclement. The enemy resisted stubbornly, showing no weakness. Our army, considering this battle as the crucial juncture for Wusong's survival, fought with all its might. The enemy attempted to break through more than ten times, but all attempts were unsuccessful. Hand-to-hand combat ensued, and the sounds of shouting and killing reverberated far and wide. The enemy also launched heavy artillery fire from across the river to provide support. However, the shells did not cause any damage to our army. After 4:00 PM, the enemy's casualties piled up, and they were exhausted and hoarse. However, they continued to fight like trapped beasts. It was not until 9:40 PM last night that all enemy troops were eliminated, with no survivors. In this battle, the hand-to-hand combat lasted for twelve hours, marking a new era in the fierce battles between China and Japan in Wusong. Our army also suffered casualties. However, thanks to the valiant efforts and high morale of our soldiers, we finally achieved the final victory and annihilated these stubborn enemies.</p>
<p>The Longhua Garrison Headquarters issued a victory report last night, stating:</p>
<p>Limited to immediate delivery, to be informed to all municipal government agencies and newspapers: Starting this morning, approximately two to three thousand enemy troops attempted to cross the Caojiaqiao and Jiajiaqiao area. Our Mao Division dispatched troops to meet them head-on with fierce attacks. After a day of intense fighting, we finally repelled them at 9:40 PM last night. The enemy suffered over a thousand casualties. Respectfully reported, Staff Office of the Songhu Garrison Command, sealed with the seal of Yuan Hai.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attempts to Cross Wenzaobang</h3>
<p>Releasing smoke bombs, a white fog fills the sky. Over a thousand enemy troops attempt to cross and land. Yesterday morning at 2:00 AM, our defending forces in the Wusong area, taking advantage of the enemy's fatigue, launched a fierce attack on the enemy's warships and nearby army positions at the mouth of the Wenzaobang and Huangpu Rivers. The enemy was caught off guard and responded hastily, suffering heavy losses. As for the enemy facing the Wenzaobang front, they actually released smoke bombs and built pontoon bridges to attempt to cross three times yesterday, but were all repelled by our army. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Attack on the Enemy Headquarters Yesterday Morning at 2:00 AM, our</h3>
<p>Wusong defending forces and plainclothes teams, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness, launched a fierce attack on the enemy warship "Yubari" and nearby army positions at the mouth of the Wenzaobang and Huangpu Rivers. This area was the location of the enemy's large troop headquarters and encampment. The enemy was caught off guard and responded hastily, resulting in hundreds of enemy soldiers being killed by our army. The enemy warship also suffered heavy damage and significant losses. The enemy side also marveled at the bravery of our army's operations.</p>
<h3>First Attempt to Cross Fails</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the enemy attempted to cross the Wenzaobang and Nansitang Rivers three times by building pontoon bridges and bamboo rafts. The first attempt was made at around 4:30 AM yesterday, when the sky was just beginning to break. Over two hundred enemy soldiers attempted to cross east of Black Bridge. They were immediately detected by our defending forces, who opened fire with machine guns and mortars. The enemy left behind more than ten corpses and abandoned their rafts to flee.</p>
<h3>Enemy Releases Smoke Bombs. The second attempt was made yesterday</h3>
<p>At around 7:00 AM, three to four hundred enemy soldiers, each carrying knives, hooks, saws, and axes, attempted to cross in front of the Nancao'an. The enemy troops also released smoke bombs, creating a white haze that covered the Wenzaobang and reached our army's position. Our army, recognizing the treacherous plan, immediately opened fire with several machine guns towards Yizhou Tangjiao. By the time the white smoke dissipated, there was no trace of the enemy. The third attempt was made at around 10:00 AM, when snowflakes were falling. Over a thousand enemy soldiers, still under the cover of smoke bombs, attempted to cross again. When they were discovered by our army's sentries, they immediately reported to the rear, and a large force was dispatched to engage them. At the same time, the enemy rapidly completed the crossing and landed, leading to a fierce battle with our army. Hand-to-hand combat was particularly intense for a while. By the time our reinforcements arrived at 12:00 PM, they had completely surrounded the enemy. As of 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the enemy was still surrounded. When the two armies were engaged in fierce fighting at Caojiaqiao and the enemy was preparing to retreat, the enemy dispatched another detachment of about three hundred soldiers to attack Jiajiaqiao. Our army responded and engaged them, and the two sides clashed for about an hour. The enemy army was unable to withstand the attack and retreated. At around 10:00 PM, the Japanese again used over five hundred soldiers, armed with handheld machine guns, to launch a fierce assault. Our army responded with machine guns and volleys of gunfire. The enemy army, due to the rain and snow, could not use armored vehicles as a vanguard, so they suffered heavy casualties. They retreated at 10:15 PM. Subsequently, the enemy army used a small number of infantry troops to attack Houjia Wooden Bridge. Our army calmly responded, and the enemy army, thinking they had an opportunity, increased their forces and advanced. Our army then opened fire with machine guns, and the enemy, realizing they had been tricked, retreated in panic.</p>
<h3>Enemy Reinforces Zhanghuabang</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at two</p>
<p>At the hour, the enemy army used heavy artillery to bombard our army's position near the two factories in Zhanghuabang. The shells landed on both sides of the Wusong City River and in the Tongji Road and Taixing Road areas. Our army suffered very little damage. Despite the enemy's indiscriminate shelling, our army remained extremely calm and did not retaliate. According to villagers near the anti-epidemic hospital across the river in Zhanghuabang, yesterday they saw small tugboats towing four large iron-hulled barges, fully loaded with enemy soldiers, from Shanghai to Zhanghuabang, where they landed. After the enemy soldiers disembarked, the tugboats returned to Shanghai to load more enemy soldiers to Songjiang, doing this four times. The last time, they saw several large cannons being transported ashore. They also saw trucks on the military road coming and going frequently, all fully loaded with enemy soldiers and ammunition, and returning empty. Based on this situation, the number of enemy soldiers in Zhanghuabang has greatly increased compared to before.</p>
<h3>A Report from the Shanghai Newspaper on a Field Inspection of the War Zone</h3>
<p>Yesterday (12th) from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, a reporter went to the area north of Zhanghuabang for a field inspection and saw that the entire town of Wusong had been reduced to rubble. Three major buildings inside Tongji University were also destroyed by artillery fire and could not be repaired. Of the remaining nine faculty housing units, eight are now occupied by soldiers. Faculty of the university went yesterday morning to retrieve some valuable instruments. However, since Wusong is not in a ceasefire area, the reporter's observation of the devastation caused by the war continued, because gunfire never ceased, and later with the artillery fire too intense, safety was questionable, he planned to take the road to the Fortress Hotel, but bullets flew directly at the reporter, and they had to urgently leave the war zone and return. Currently, more than half of the town of Wusong has been destroyed by artillery shells and fire. On the road from the town to</p>
<p>Fortress, there are also broken walls and ruins everywhere, and pedestrians have to climb over them. The private and public houses that survived all have bullet holes all over them, like honeycombs. On the road along the river, there are troops stationed, piling up sandbags and defenses to guard the area. As far as the reporter knows for sure, the Wusong Fortress is still defended by Chinese troops and remains unscathed, and the British flag is still hanging on the flagpole of the Fortress Hotel. Tongji University's buildings suffered the most damage. A large artillery shell went straight through the anatomy room, destroying everything in its path. Even the windows are rarely intact. The loss of instruments and records is priceless. The engineering and science buildings were also severely damaged. A bomb dropped by an aircraft exploded in the center of the open space inside the university. A professor went to his library and witnessed valuable books and instruments worth more than 5,000 yuan in ruins, and burst into tears. His residence, hundreds of yards away, was also destroyed by another artillery shell. What was salvaged from the ashes this time was only enough to restart his life. When all the Westerners left the school, the janitor locked the door, and the German flag was still fluttering on the flag triumphal road. British officers (photo by Li Zunyong).</p>
<p>From Liuhang to Wusong, the reporter saw along the way yesterday that the number of Chinese soldiers has not been as large as it was four days ago. Most of them are hiding in places that can provide cover. Even the soldiers that were seen are mostly working, and there are few idle people. Therefore, the reporter was able to see hundreds of yards of newly dug trenches, just within a mile of the Zhenru Road construction site. There are four bridges, all of which are guarded by many soldiers. As for the open areas, there are very few soldiers. In addition to the machine guns set up at the ends of the bridges, the soldiers have automatic rifles and hand grenades. Some carry Mill-type bombs. Other places where soldiers are defending are all disguised with other objects on the outside, making them extremely difficult to detect. Similar trenches can also be seen in the distance outside the main road. However, the Chinese army seems to rely on natural barriers such as rivers and lakes to defend, and has not taken any further measures to consolidate these natural defenses. Because the area is easy to defend, any army that wants to occupy it will suffer heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Situation of the Fierce Battle in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Shot down an enemy plane. Shells landed at the Japanese headquarters. Enemy soldiers suffered heavy casualties. Yesterday (13th), in the Zhabei area, the Japanese army, due to its failure to attack the night before (12th), redeployed fresh troops to the front line to replenish its forces. At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, it issued an order to continue the general assault on our army's defense line. As a result, fierce battles broke out one after another on Qiujiang Road, Tiantong'an Road, Xinmin Road, and Qingyun Road. At the same time, eight Japanese planes flew into the sky to assist in the battle and dropped five large bombs in the Macken Road area and the Huzhou Guild Hall. There were also about fifty lighter bombs. Interspersed with heavy artillery fire, our army fought back bravely and used anti-aircraft guns to bombard the Japanese planes. One of the planes exploded at a distance of twenty yards. As a result, the Japanese planes fled in disorder and turned to Zhenru to drop bombs, about a dozen times, but failed. They were shot back by our anti-aircraft guns. One of the planes was shot down by our army. At 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, our army's artillery team opened fire and hit the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road, destroying several buildings and killing a Japanese major staff officer and several enemy soldiers. At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, our army's artillery team again hit the Japanese Second Command Headquarters inside the Japanese Children's Public School, The following is a description of the various situations:</p>
<h3>The Japanese Launched a General Assault on Zhabei Yesterday Morning at Around 8:00 AM,</h3>
<p>Over a thousand Japanese soldiers, using aircraft bombing, artillery cover, and the replenishment of fresh troops from the rear, launched a general assault on our army's outpost lines in Qiujiang Road, Xinmin Road, Tiantong'an Road, Qingyun Road, and other places. At that time, it was raining and snowing, and our army immediately rose up in the snow to resist. Both sides used field artillery, steel cannons, and machine guns to cover their firing. Japanese planes also came to assist in the battle, hoping to disrupt our army's rear, but were quickly repelled by our anti-aircraft guns. The soldiers on our front line charged into and out of the enemy's阵地 several times. At around 10:00 AM, the enemy army was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed. Our army's defense line was as solid as a wall, with only over twenty people injured. The Japanese soldiers suffered heavy casualties. Later, a certain chief of staff of the division stated that the Japanese army's intention in the battle this morning (yesterday morning) was to disrupt our army's lines, but these guys were very afraid of death, their morale was low when fighting us, and they mostly used sharp weapons to cover themselves. As a result, they were all repelled by our army. Now our army's defense of the front line is very solid, and it is difficult for the Japanese army to cross the Lei Pond even one step, and so on.</p>
<h3>Shells Landed at the Japanese Headquarters During the Fierce Battle Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>, the intensity of the artillery bombardment from both sides was the first time since the start of the war. From 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM, it did not stop. The Japanese soldiers aimed to bomb the civilian houses in the Zhabei area, but all the shells fell halfway or exploded in the concession. Our army's artillery team fired accurately, without any mistakes. The Japanese Marine Corps headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road was hit by our army's artillery team at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday (12th), destroying a building, killing a Japanese major staff officer, and injuring several enemy soldiers. Yesterday morning (13th), the Japanese Second Command Headquarters, located inside the Japanese Children's Public School on Yokohamabashi in North Sichuan Road, was again hit and exploded by our army, causing numerous casualties. There was a lot of blood on the ground, and few survived. Afterwards, the Japanese soldiers' artillery bombardment gradually decreased and stopped after 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Japanese Corpses Were Transported Back Yesterday Afternoon at Two</h3>
<p>At the hour, the reporter passed by the Waibaidu Bridge outside the city and witnessed nine trucks, all full of Japanese soldiers' corpses, estimated to be over a thousand. They were all packed in sacks, and fresh red blood was flowing out from the seams of the sacks. They came from the direction of North Sichuan Road and stopped in front of the Japanese Consulate there. The Japanese soldiers who were escorting them, armed with hand-held machine guns, forced the Chinese to carry the sacks one by one from the trucks and stack them in the nearby warehouses. It was said that the Chinese who were carrying the sacks were all residents of the Hongkou area who had been captured by the Japanese army and were being used as forced labor. The reporter witnessed that these people were mentally exhausted and looked haggard, and many of them were intellectuals. When they were carrying the Japanese soldiers' corpses, Japanese soldiers with guns stood by to monitor them closely. One of them, because he was a little stubborn, was shot and killed by a Japanese soldier. This kind of behavior by the Japanese army is truly inhumane. Foreigners are all indignant about this and praise the integrity of our army.</p>
<h3>The Huzhou Guild Hall Was Destroyed Yesterday Morning at Seven</h3>
<p>Starting at the hour, the Japanese soldiers again used heavy artillery to bombard our Zhabei Huiwen Road Huzhou Guild Hall. The buildings of the guild hall had previously been bombed and destroyed by planes, leaving only a portion of Building C intact. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the enemy army used heavy artillery to bombard it again. The shells flew horizontally, and as a result, all the houses in Building C were completely destroyed. The corpses in the coffins, after being hit by the shells, had severed heads, missing arms, broken abdomens, and cracked backs. All the bones were scattered, and all the red and green burial clothes were turned to ashes. The other places that were destroyed by stray bullets were also numerous. It is said that the shells used by the enemy army are all explosive shells, so all places that are hit by the shells are completely destroyed.</p>
<h3>The Fierce Battle at Tiantong'an</h3>
<p>The reporter met wounded soldier Jiang Guilin in the hospital yesterday (13th). According to Jiang, the scene of resisting the enemy army at Tiantong'an the night before (12th) was briefly as follows: "I am from Hunan Province and joined the army in Jiangxi a month ago, serving in the Sixtieth Division. After just a month, I was assigned to the position of deputy squad leader. Last night, we were defending Tiantong'an Road. Our army had posted sentries, and we were all determined that if the enemy did not come, then so be it, but if they came, we would definitely resist. Unexpectedly, at 7:00 PM, the enemy opened fire and bombarded us fiercely. Our army ignored them and let them waste their bullets. However, the enemy's bombardment became more and more intense and did not stop for two hours. They also sent out over two hundred enemy soldiers to charge towards our defensive position. At 7:15 PM, they first clashed with our sentries. As they approached our defensive fortifications, our army suddenly counterattacked and used gunfire to sweep the area, killing about fifty enemy soldiers. After fighting for about a quarter of an hour, we saw that the enemy was exhausted and showed signs of being unable to withstand the attack and wanting to retreat. We also thought that the enemy had come by crossing the embankment, and they would have to cross the embankment again when retreating, which would not be easy compared to retreating on the plains. Therefore, we immediately charged out with all our strength to engage them. The sound of hand grenades exploding was incessant. By the time the enemy had completely retreated south across the embankment, they seemed to be in great disarray. At this time, the number of enemies killed in the embankment had increased by more than twenty. I was wounded in the foot while charging out and was carried to the regimental headquarters by the rescuers (it was 11:30 PM). I waited until dawn (yesterday morning) before being transferred to the hospital for treatment. At midnight, I heard a report at the regimental headquarters that only half of the over two hundred enemy soldiers survived. Because the enemy was attacking and we were defending, the enemy suffered heavy casualties, while we only suffered more than ten casualties. After 12:00 AM that night, the sound of gunfire gradually subsided."</p>
<h3>The Noble Character of Our Army</h3>
<p>According to those who returned from inspecting the front line, when the enemy army launched a surprise attack on Wusong the day before, several Japanese soldiers were intercepted by our army soldiers. After surrendering their weapons, they lay on the ground and begged for mercy. Our soldiers, seeing that they had lost their ability to fight and were pitiful and despicable, released them and said to them, "Go get your guns and come back to die." The Japanese soldiers then scurried away in panic. The integrity and strength of our army can be seen from this. On the other hand, the Japanese army, as soon as our soldiers were intercepted, would massacre them. Whenever they encountered wounded soldiers groaning on the ground, they would stab them several times with their bayonets, causing them to writhe in agony until they died. Their cruel behavior is truly unforgivable by humanity. Foreigners are all indignant about this and praise the noble character of our army.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, Japanese Bombs肆虐</h3>
<p>Specifically harming civilians. Disturbing the Concession. The Japanese bandits in Shanghai, losing every battle, used their only means of venting their anger to be the dropping of bombs by planes and plainclothes teams on our defenseless civilians, calling it "disrupting the rear." It is unknown how effective this is for the war effort, but it only shows their cruelty and inhumanity. What is most noteworthy is that they frequently drop bombs in the concession area, seemingly deliberately making things difficult for the concession authorities. The following is a breakdown of the situation regarding the bombs yesterday:</p>
<h3>Zhenru Area</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 7:00 AM, six enemy planes took off from the temporary airfield opened by the Japanese in the Yangshupu area and went straight to Zhabei. After circling several times in the air, they flew to Zhenru, intending to destroy the International Radio Station. They dropped over ten bombs, but they all landed on the open space south of Jinan University. At that time, our army used anti-aircraft guns to bombard them, and the enemy was unable to succeed and fled.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Area</h3>
<p>The enemy planes retreated from Zhenru and passed through Zhabei, dropping bombs one after another at the Macken Road Station, the Republican New Road, and Qingyun Road, also more than ten bombs. At around 9:30 AM, the Japanese army used heavy artillery to shell the Jiangwan area from afar. The enemy planes, hearing the sound, also flew towards that direction to侦察 and bomb the Wenzaobang area. After more than an hour, they returned to the Yangshupu airfield. 1) According to a survey by the New Voice Society, Japanese planes dropped two bombs on the Republican New Road, two near the First Branch of the Fourth District, two on Yongxing Road, and two on Yongxing Branch Road. However, only one bomb exploded, destroying many houses but not injuring anyone. Two bombs were also dropped on Zhongxing Road, injuring one military policeman and one coolie. Another letter stated that yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, more than ten bombs were dropped by Japanese planes north of the Zhongshan Road Shuimending Bridge. One of the bombs exploded, killing three people: one was the son of Lu Atao, a villager in the area, named Xiaotao, thirteen years old; one was Zhang Xiaoshi, a coolie from Funing; and one was the pregnant wife of Wang Laohan, a salt merchant, named Ji, twenty-eight years old, seven or eight months pregnant. It was also reported that yesterday morning, a Japanese plane was shot down by our army near the Mongolia Road north of the New Garbage Bridge. 2) In the area north and south of Zhongxing Road on the Republican New Road, yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, three Japanese planes dropped more than ten bombs, none of which exploded. However, one bomb landed on the east side of the Republican New Road, and there was a loud bang. All the houses shook, and a large hole formed in the road, more than two丈 deep and about one丈 in circumference. Bricks and stones flew everywhere. At the same time, two bombs landed north of Zhongxing Road, but none of them exploded. 3) Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, several Japanese military planes dropped bombs on the Zhabei District. The Guangdong Hospital at the intersection of Tiantong'an Road and Zhonghua New Road was unfortunately hit by bombs and sulfur bombs dropped by Japanese planes, a total of four bombs. For a while, the hospital was filled with smoke and fire spread. The fire started at 9:30 AM and was not extinguished until 12:30 PM. It was reported that five or six rooms in the northeast corner of the hospital were burned down. 4) A reporter from the Nationalist Society went to Zhabei yesterday (13th) morning at around 8:30 AM and saw two planes circling in the sky. Then, they randomly dropped bombs in the Yongxing Road and Huiwen Road area, about a dozen bombs. They knocked down more than twenty houses in the Huzhou Guild Hall, and the coffins that were originally placed there were all blown to pieces. The newly placed corpses were scattered everywhere, a tragic sight. The disaster even affected the dry bones. This is how brave the Japanese army is.</p>
<h3>Public Concession</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, a bomb was dropped by a Japanese plane on the bank of the Suzhou River north of the Shanghai West Sampan Factory, destroying a corner of a grocery store.</p>
<h3>French Concession</h3>
<p>(1) Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, a Japanese airplane came to the sky above Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession and dropped a bomb, which landed in the middle of the road in front of numbers 91 and 93. The intersection of Route Keylär to the north was a vegetable market, and it was the peak time for vendors to be out selling. This resulted in eight men and women being injured by the bombing. Gao Linxiang, 35 years old, had his right leg injured, and Xu A'yu, 18 years old, had both legs injured. Both were local vegetable vendors. Due to the severity of their injuries, they were sent by police car to the World Red Cross at 141 Route Massenet for treatment. Six other men and women were injured, but their injuries were minor, so they did not go to the hospital and returned home for treatment. (2) Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, a bomb fell from the sky and struck the roof of Wanshun Sauce Garden at number 18, Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession, creating a hole. Fortunately, no one was injured. (3) Yesterday morning at 9:10 AM, a bomb fell on the roof of the house of Yang Bingyuan, a resident at number 11, Rue du Moulin à Vapeur in the French Concession. The explosive force was minimal, and no one was injured. (4) In front of the Xintai Native Products Store at number 45, Route Laguerre in the French Concession, a bomb fell into the road at 9:30 AM yesterday morning, but no one was injured. (5) Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, in front of the Xinxiangtai Native Products Store at number 45, Huanghe Road, behind the Slaughterhouse Company in the French Concession, a bomb was thrown by the plainclothes team of the brutal Japanese. With a loud bang, the nearby residents were alarmed, but no one paid attention to the plainclothes team who threw the bomb, allowing them to escape. The Far Eastern News Agency reporter, amidst the crowd, saw a large hole blown in the outer counter pillar of the store, and a hole was also blown in the stone slab on the ground. The store clerks were all inside the store and were spared. However, a female worker surnamed Xu, residing in the front building at number 30, who happened to be shopping at the store, was injured in more than ten places on her thigh. Wang Gui'shi, 50 years old, and Teacher Wang, 22 years old, both from Ningbo, of the Sanxing Carriage Company at number 49, were injured in their left legs and other places. Zhu A'gen, 10 years old, of the front building at number 19, Route Hennequin, was injured in his head and face, his neck was pierced by shrapnel, and he was spitting blood. All were sent to the contagious disease hospital for treatment. Wei Pengzhi's daughter, 8 years old, of the Dabing Store at number 10, was injured in the head, legs, and hands, and her abdomen was blown open. She was sent to Renji Hospital. According to the doctor, an operation is needed to remove the shrapnel, and whether the intestines and stomach have been damaged can only be determined after the operation.</p>
<h3>Southern Shanghai Area</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, a Japanese military plainclothes team, disguised as Chinese people, sneaked into Xiaopi Alley and Xiaobeimen in the city to throw bombs. A bomb was thrown at the intersection of Tongqing Street, Xiaobeimen, next to the Qianda Dyeing Workshop. The sound was not loud, and fortunately, no one was injured. The person who threw the bomb escaped. The bombs thrown in Xiaopi Alley also did not injure anyone.</p>
<h3>Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Ding Shenglin, 42 years old, a tea server on the New Beijing Steamer, hired Xu Xinshun, a local resident, and his sampan boat to go to Lan Ni Du, Pudong, yesterday morning at 9:15 AM. While sailing in the Huangpu River, stray bullets flew over. One bullet hit Ding's right leg, and another hit Xu's foot. Both went to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Foreign Press Reports</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that this morning (13th) around 7:45 AM, the sound of guns and cannons was heard again from the Zhabei front line, but it was not very intense. Just after 9:00 AM, the sound ceased, with only occasional mortar fire. Several shells landed in the French Concession this morning, injuring a total of twelve people. British soldiers patrolled the Route Pichon area in the Northern District. (Photo by Li Zunyong)</p>
<p>The extent of the damage to the area around Avenue du President Wilson, Route Doumer, and Rue Auguste Boppe has not yet been fully ascertained. This morning, when Japanese planes bombarded the Meigen Road railway area with heavy bombs, the Chinese army's anti-aircraft gunners used heavy artillery to fire at them. According to eyewitnesses, the Chinese soldiers fired with considerable accuracy, and several shells exploded in the sky less than twenty yards from the Japanese planes. There have been no changes to the front lines between Zhabei and Hongkou Park this morning. Around 8:30 AM this morning, a small shell hit the wall of the Western Boys' Public School of the Municipal Council, opposite the Japanese Naval Headquarters on North Sichuan Road, shattering several panes of glass. A mortar shell also landed in front of the Japanese Children's Public School on North Sichuan Road this morning. The school houses the Japanese Second Naval Headquarters, and several sailors were injured when the shell exploded. The number of casualties is unknown, but the canal in the road ran red with blood, indicating that there must have been many injured. Houses behind the Rue du Stand and Rue Auguste Boppe caught fire this morning due to being hit by shells. Several shells also landed in the Route Doumer area this morning. One shell exploded in front of number 265 on that road, shattering many glass windows. Between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM this morning, a small shell also landed behind the Hui Zhong Hotel on Nanjing Road. Because it hit the wall before exploding, there was no damage. In the French Concession, at 8:10 AM this morning, a shell landed on the roof of number 11, Rue du Moulin à Vapeur, without injuring anyone. Another shell landed at number 97, Route Tenant de la Tour, slightly injuring eight Chinese. Another shell landed at number 45, Lao Yong'an Street, injuring four Chinese. Another shell landed on Xinqiao Street, without injuring anyone. Around 8:00 AM on Saturday morning, eight Japanese planes flew over Zhabei and dropped fifteen bombs, six of which were heavy bombs. The sound was so loud that it shook the entire city of Shanghai. These were the largest bombs dropped by Japanese planes since the start of the Zhabei battle. It is reported that six small carts transporting tea on Baoshan Road were hit by bombs, injuring one woman in the carts.</p>
<p>Important News from the Japanese Side</p>
<p>[Commander Nomura's Statement in the North China Daily News</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that yesterday (12th), Commander Nomura told the newspaper's reporter that he was only temporarily in charge of the naval and land forces in Shanghai. Once the army division is fully deployed to Shanghai, the land battles will be commanded by Major General Tameda, and he will only command the navy. Therefore, there is not much to say about the future land battles. What can be said at this time is that he and Tameda have received clear instructions from the Japanese government to be extremely cautious in implementing the plan to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Joins the Front Line North China Daily News</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the Japanese have now added newly arrived troops to reinforce the front line at the Wusong-Zhabei area. The Zhabei area is still being fought by the Naval Landing Forces, but within days the army will replace the Naval Landing Forces.</p>
<h3>Japanese Plainclothes Team Interferes with Western Police North China Daily News</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that after the police of Avenue du President Wilson precinct withdrew on Tuesday, yesterday (12th), Friday, they were able to resume some of their duties in the area. Although the Western police officers were unable to return to their original positions, they patrolled the area between 7:00 AM and 5:30 PM. However, according to official reports, the Japanese plainclothes team was very active on Wednesday night and Thursday. Although the police station started working yesterday, there was almost nothing to do and police officers were frequently interfered with. When a Western police officer was supervising the removal of a corpse on the open space of the Western Boys' Public School, suddenly fifty members of the Japanese plainclothes team came to obstruct. Finally, a Japanese police officer had to be sent to handle it before order was restored. Also, yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, Robinson, a Western police officer from the Harbin police station, was driving his private car along North Sichuan Road, about twenty yards south of the Rue du Stand intersection, when a Japanese plainclothes team suddenly came out and stopped him, asking where he was going. The police officer replied that he was going to the Harbin police station for duty. The Japanese man, speaking fluent English, actually said, "You can't go there." The police officer questioned the reason, and the man replied, "Don't go on duty." The police officer told him that in this emergency period, he must be on duty at all times, and that his uniform proved it, but the Japanese man still refused to let him pass. The police officer had no choice but to get out of the car and walk north, but the Japanese man followed closely behind and suddenly punched the police officer in the back. When the police officer turned around, he punched him in the face again. The police officer was furious and returned a punch, but a Japanese Marine Corps soldier came forward and blocked him with his rifle. Afterwards, the police officer reported to the Hongkou police station and filed a protest. A Japanese naval officer came to the police station to apologize, claiming that the Marine Corps had little power to restrain Japanese civilians, but when the incident occurred, the Japanese officer was standing nearby.</p>
<h3>Japanese Praise Our Army's Bravery</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly Accurate Shelling, Very Clever Tactics, Japanese Company Commander Commits Suicide, Osaka Mainichi, news from the 6th, stated that the enemy's (referring to our army) field artillery fire was unexpectedly accurate (direct translation from Japanese). Our (referring to the Japanese army) Marine Corps headquarters has been hit by more than ten enemy shells in the past few days, and our army has suffered great losses due to being unfamiliar with street fighting. Moreover, the enemy has used machine guns to charge in front of our army's armored vehicles. If we fire indiscriminately, the enemy falls silent, and our army thinks it is safe to advance, but the enemy seizes the opportunity to rush out, and we fall into their trap again. This kind of clever tactic has caused the majority of casualties in our army (all directly translated from Japanese, which shows that the enemy's courage has been chilled and they are telling the truth). The reporter also found that in this war, the deaths and injuries of Japanese officers such as mine captains, navigation captains, company commanders, and ship captains are no fewer than forty or fifty, while only one or two of our lower-ranking officers have been injured. The Jiji Shimpo also reported that the most surprising thing is that an eight-inch shell from the enemy suddenly fell on the roof of our Marine Corps headquarters' command room. Fortunately, the shell did not explode, otherwise the leading officers of our Marine Corps would have been completely wiped out. This is also a blessing from heaven for our army, but the officers have been frightened and look like wooden chickens.</p>
<p>Also, the Osaka Mainichi Newspaper on the 6th published a report from the Shanghai correspondent Okada, stating that our army (referring to the Japanese army) is fighting hard on all fronts in Shanghai, and Cai Tingkai's army is the iron army of China, and the strength of its soldiers is evident. Therefore, our army's war situation has not progressed at all. The concessions are in danger at every moment. According to the current situation, merely delaying the time will increase the sacrifice of our army.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun received a telegram from the Changchun correspondent Ikeda, stating that the commander of the Japanese army's Hasebe Brigade, at a banquet in the Donghua Club inside Shuangchengpu Station on the evening of the 1st, reported his impressions of the war. At the beginning, he stated "Chinese soldiers are indeed not to be humiliated." He continued, "I (referring to Commander Hasebe) have had very profound feelings in this war that were unexpected by our people (Japanese). The Chinese soldiers' fighting is indeed not cowardly (direct translation from Japanese). When I witnessed the Jinan Incident, the enemy jumped over corpses and rushed into our positions. In the fierce battle of Shuangchengpu, the enemy (our army) again launched a night attack on our army (Japanese), and the enemy was not afraid of artillery fire, actively launching an offensive against us (Japanese). Their courage is truly irresistible. At that time, our army (Japanese) did not have many troops, so we concentrated the supply department, the medical department, and the troops attached to other brigades at the station in order to shorten the front line. However, the enemy troops disregarding their lives, swarmed in under a rain of artillery fire, causing our army (Japanese) to lose courage."</p>
<p>A Japanese newspaper also published a special telegram from Dentsu Shanghai on the 2nd, stating that "Company Commander Miimaru, this morning at 3:00 AM, stabbed himself in the chest with his saber, leaving behind a letter containing the words 'Urge Commander Shiozawa to make a decision and reflect deeply, and regain the honor of defeat,'" etc. This is why there was a false rumor of Shiozawa's suicide.</p>
<h3>The Situation: Peace and War Progressing Simultaneously</h3>
<p>British, American, and French Envoys Propose Mediation Plan, Wu Tiecheng Hosts Banquet for Jiang Guangnai and Other Important Figures, Central Committee Members Stationed in Shanghai Hold Meeting Yesterday. As the Japanese army invades our territory, our 19th Route Army soldiers are bravely resisting for self-defense, confronting each other on the Wusong and Zhabei front lines for half a month. Recently, British Envoy Lampson, American Envoy Johnson, and French Envoy Wilden, visited Shanghai together, and the idea of mediation has become very popular.

It is also reported that the Japanese government instructed Shigemitsu on three matters as follows: (1) To cooperate with the four envoys of Britain, America, France, and Italy to study the issue of a ceasefire and the establishment of a neutral zone. (2) The issue of anti-Japanese sentiment and the Shanghai Incident are to be resolved as separate issues, and third parties are not allowed to join. (3) Only these two points are to be the principles, but the proposals of the four envoys should still be considered, without insisting on a fixed limit.</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi's Speech</h3>
<p>This newspaper reporter visited Foreign Vice Minister Guo Taiqi yesterday to inquire about the war and peace policy.

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Nearly Strikes British Envoy's Flagship</h3>
<p>British and American Envoys Witness Wusong War Situation. The North China Daily News reported that on the afternoon of the 12th, British Envoy Lampson sailed from Beijing to Shanghai on the British warship HMS Cricket. They almost struck a Japanese bomb when passing through the Wusong mouth. At that time, a Japanese plane was bombarding the Wusong fort in the sky, and a shell landed in the Huangpu River, not far from the British warship. Shortly afterwards, American Envoy Johnson also passed through Song on the USS Simpson. Both envoys witnessed the Wusong war situation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Destroys Chih Chih School</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Lodged a Protest Yesterday. The Municipal Government lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul General yesterday regarding the repeated burning of the Chih Chih College and High School buildings by the Japanese army, and the killing and wounding of school employees and guards. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Sir, it was reported on the 4th of this month that yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the High School Department of Chih Chih College on Jiangwan Road was suddenly raided by the Japanese army, who used bayonets to brutally kill the security guards and tea servants. A female tea server was unable to escape and was also killed. All the buildings of the High School Department were set on fire. While we were verifying the report, another report stated that at 5:00 PM on the 10th, Japanese soldiers with machine guns raided the University Department of Chih Chih College on Shuidian Road. First, they sprayed the security guards with machine guns, and then set fire to the building, destroying all the new four-story dormitory building, which could accommodate over a thousand people, the two-story classroom building, the auditorium, the library, the dining hall, the specimen room, the instrument room, the power room, and the water tower. Your country's troops have repeatedly destroyed our country's cultural institutions and brutally killed defenseless civilians. Such unreasonable destruction is not permitted by justice. In addition to reserving the right to demand conditions, this letter is hereby sent to you for your reference and action."</p>
<h3>Japanese Secretly Dismantle Wusong Navigational Buoys</h3>
<p>Two Removed and Handed Over to Japanese Warship Yesterday. The Japanese army secretly destroyed the navigational buoys outside the Wusong mouth, which were used by the customs to indicate navigation, causing all Shanghai sea traffic to be disrupted. The viciousness of their design will effectively block the Wusong waterway, posing a great danger to merchant ships. The confirmed information obtained is detailed below.</p>
<h3>Wusong Navigational Lights</h3>
<p>The mouth of Wusong is the hub of all sea routes and waterways. All ships, whether coastal, ocean-going, or Yangtze River ships, must pass through it. There is only one navigation route there. All the reefs and shallow shoals that can obstruct navigation are surveyed by the Jianghai Customs survey ship, and special navigational buoys are placed, with red flags and lights on top, to guide merchant ships to avoid them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Secret Dismantling</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese used two small steamers to sail to the waters outside the Wusong mouth, secretly dismantled two of the buoys placed by the Jianghai Customs, and removed dozens of feet of anchor chain. The Japanese stealing and moving the navigational buoys is obviously intended to disrupt sea traffic, prevent merchant ships from entering and exiting, and effectively seal off the mouth of the Song.</p>
<h3>Stolen and Handed Over to Warship</h3>
<p>After the two small steamers secretly moved the two buoys, they towed them to Shanghai at 3:30 PM and anchored them alongside the Japanese First Overseas Dispatch Fleet flagship Ataka off the Xinkai River. The buoys were handed over to the Ataka for safekeeping by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Customs Investigate Thoroughly</h3>
<p>After receiving the alert, the Jianghai Customs immediately dispatched a Japanese official from the Harbor Affairs Department, who is in charge of anchoring affairs, to the Japanese warship Ataka to investigate the matter, as it concerns the sea traffic of this port and the safety of merchant ships.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Sino-British Company Protest to Japanese</h3>
<p>Company Has Significant Investment, Oppose Japanese Military Destruction, Continental Daily News reported that the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Nanjing-Shanghai, and Beijing-Shanghai Railways have significant investment from the Sino-British Company. Yesterday, the company's representative, Mr. Poustie, protested to the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai and the Japanese military authorities, opposing the Japanese military's occupation of the railway industry invested in by Britain, and urging the Japanese military authorities not to damage railway factories, stations, houses, and locomotive sheds. The Japanese side replied, stating that the Japanese military authorities did not want to damage the railway industry, but because of the damage caused by the war, the Japanese military could not be held responsible. According to reports, Mr. Poustie recently arrived in Shanghai from the three northeastern provinces, where the Beining Railway also has British investment. Mr. Poustie had previously protested to the Japanese authorities in Shenyang, opposing the Japanese military's occupation of a section of the railway.</p>
<h3>Yong An Number Three Factory Case Transferred To Washington For Processing</h3>
<p>Eyewitnesses Say Not Coincidental. The Continental Daily News reported that the case of the Japanese aircraft bombing the Yong An Number Three Cotton Mill has been transferred to the State Department in Washington for processing. Admiral Tayner, the Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, has investigated the details of the case and reported them to the State Department. Although Rear Admiral Nomura, the commander of the Japanese Navy, said that the aircraft's bombs were accidentally dropped, causing the disaster, eyewitnesses all believed that the bombing was intentional. It is said that a reconnaissance plane guided the bomber, first flying several times over the factory to clearly survey its location. After dropping the bomb, the bomber rose high and circled to avoid being affected by the force of the explosion. Those experienced in aviation all know this technique. Afterwards, another bomb was dropped, flying towards Zhenru, which was definitely not accidental.</p>

<h3>Chinese Police Patriotism Enlists</h3>
<p>Since The Japanese Invaded Shanghai, People From All Walks Of Life, Including Women And Children, Vendors And Peddlers, Have Done What They Can To Support The Heroic 19th Route Army That Is Killing The Enemy, And The Chinese Police Of The Concession Police Department, Even More So With The Same Hatred, Have Been Applying For Resignation In Droves, And There Are Many Who Have Joined The Army, These Chinese Police Have Served In The Army Before, And Are Very Experienced In Combat, Even Those Who Have Never Served In The Military, And Have Been Trained By The Concession Police Department For Several Years, Their Gun Skills Are Also Extremely Skilled, And What's More, They Are All Volunteering To Serve The Country This Time, And They Will Surely Break Through The Enemy On This Trip</p>
<h3>Expression from the Shanghai Municipal Council Refugee Association</h3>
<p>Direct losses suffered, demanding full compensation: Declaration of the Shanghai Municipal Council Refugee Association: We note that this time, the violent Japanese forcefully initiated hostilities, ravaging the Northeast, and now stirring up war on the Shanghai Bund, recklessly bombing and killing our residents, burning our cities to ashes. The authorities of the concessions, beforehand, did not make appropriate preparations to stop their violence. After the incident occurred, they did not use power to restrain them, to atone for their past negligence. They merely made empty statements and announcements, vaguely stating, "This Bureau is now exerting its full efforts to maintain peace, order, and the safety of life and property within the jurisdiction, requesting all residents within the concession to be aware and to peacefully continue their occupations," and so on. This only caused the violent Japanese to become even more reckless, with the tragic disaster expanding daily. Our people's property has been completely destroyed, and the dead lie piled upon each other. Those who managed to escape the tiger's mouth are all displaced, suffering from hunger and cold, merely waiting to die. Since the establishment of the concessions, the authorities have always collected various taxes from the residents on time. It can be said that our people have fulfilled their responsibilities as citizens. The authorities should provide practical protection for the lives and property of the residents. How can there be any doubt? Now, not only did they fail to provide protection during the incident, but they also did not warn residents to evacuate before the tragedy. Their failure to fulfill their duties is truly indefensible. The members of our association, having survived this disaster, feel that if we do not quickly seek relief, the future is unimaginable. Therefore, we have specially convened the refugees to organize the Shanghai Municipal Council Refugee Association, to collect all direct losses suffered by the refugees within the concession, and request the Shanghai Municipal Council to provide full compensation. At the same time, we request that they guarantee to stop the violent Japanese behavior, so that the people in other areas who have not suffered direct damage will not repeat our mistakes. In addition to sending a separate letter to the Municipal Council for serious negotiations, this declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3>Official Letter</h3>
<p>Also, a letter to Mr. Mai, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, states: Respectfully, this time, the violent Japanese have broken faith and disregarded international treaties, recklessly initiating hostilities. Your Bureau, blind to the situation, provided no appropriate protection for the Northeast, leading to the violent Japanese acting recklessly, resulting in a cruel tragedy unprecedented in human history. Concession residents' lives and property were indiscriminately shot, killed, and looted, which is an undeniable fact. Since the concession residents have fulfilled their obligation to pay taxes, your Bureau should be responsible for maintaining law and order and protecting their lives and property. Before this incident, your Bureau had issued a grand announcement, stating, "This Bureau is now exerting its full efforts to maintain peace, order, and the safety of life and property within the jurisdiction, requesting all residents within the concession to be aware and to peacefully continue their occupations," and so on. Who knew that shortly after the announcement was made, the so-called peace, order, life, and property were all trampled, devastated, and completely destroyed by the violent Japanese? Your Bureau did not provide effective restraint, nor did it inform the residents to evacuate beforehand. Therefore, your Bureau should be fully responsible for compensating for the losses suffered by the residents this time. Otherwise, if you collect various taxes from the residents on weekdays but then stand idly by and fail to effectively protect their lives and property once an incident occurs, how can this be justified? In addition to publishing a notice to investigate and collect information on the lives and property of the victims, compiling a list to prepare for claiming compensation, we hereby submit this letter, making a serious statement, and requesting that you guarantee to stop the violent Japanese behavior, so that the areas that have not suffered direct damage will not repeat the mistakes of those two areas, so that they can live in peace and fulfill their duties. We also hope for a prompt reply.</p>

<h3>News from the War Zone Refugees Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai War Zone Refugees Temporary Relief Association sent eight ambulances yesterday. Chen Wenkui went to Luodian Dachang and rescued 47 people. Jiang Shangqing went to Datong Road and rescued 53 people. Wu Siyuan went to Luodian Dachang and rescued 44 people.

Recently, due to the prolongation of the war, more and more refugees have gathered in the concessions. Although the War Zone Refugees Relief Association and other groups have sent some out of the country, the shelters where the refugees are staying are still overcrowded. Mr. Huang Jinrong, a prominent figure in this city, was saddened by this and specially opened the Great World and Qitian Stage to shelter refugees, each of which can accommodate over 500 people. Furthermore, Mr. Chen Aishi, Director-General of the National Government Accounting Department, inspected the Renji Hall Refugee Relief Association yesterday and, upon learning about the crowded conditions in the refugee shelters, specially discussed with Shen Tianxin and Pan Gongzhan, fellow villagers from Huzhou living in Shanghai, the opening of the entire Huzhou Society to shelter refugees, which can accommodate about 300 to 400 people. The above three places are entrusted to the Refugee Relief Association to handle. The association also rented a new house on Ladu Road, Remy Lane, as the 15th shelter. Furthermore, Ms. Liu Lingji had previously lent her self-owned building on Albert Road to the Refugee Relief Association as a shelter. Now, she has jointly funded the rental of two foreign houses on Xiaoshadu Road with Mrs. Jiang Baili to serve as a refugee isolation hospital, which is particularly admirable for her enthusiasm for charity.

<h3>Liu Suijiu and Others Urge Landlords to Contribute to Military Expenses</h3>
<p>Tens of Millions of Dollars Can Be Easily Raised: Liu Suijiu and others respectfully appeal to all landlords in Shanghai to donate rent to aid military expenses, etc. Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident broke out, our heroic 19th Route Army has risen up to defend itself with iron and blood, fighting against the Japanese soldiers who kill, set fires, and have no justice or humanity. For more than ten days, it has been able to repeatedly defeat the enemy's forces, fighting for the survival of our nation and the dignity of our country. However, if we want to control the enemy's fate and win the final victory, resolving the Northeast issue and the Shanghai incident together, we must prepare for a protracted war. It is said that the enemy has already decided to issue 40 million yuan in public bonds for war expenses. The extension of the war is beyond doubt, and the military needs are vast and can be estimated in advance. How our government will plan to pay for it is the responsibility of the officials in charge. All of our compatriots who cannot carry guns and throw bombs to die on the front line should also transport grain and transfer military expenses, serving on the rear. Recently, there has been no shortage of enthusiastic citizens who have been transporting supplies, but simply offering food and drink only shows sincere comfort, while supplementing supplies and preparing for the long term relies on the generous donations of the wealthy. Since the outbreak of this war, all industries have declined, but the landlords who rent out properties still receive their profits as usual. Considering righteousness and measuring strength, in this national crisis, landlords should use their conscience to give up even a hair, or donate one month's rent, or donate a percentage of the monthly rent. Landlords are all wealthy, and giving up this small amount will not bankrupt them, and accumulating small streams will form a large river. Calculating the donation of one month's rent in Shanghai, tens of millions of yuan can be easily raised. Its contribution to the country's economic and military use is immense. If the country perishes, the family will also be destroyed. The Shanghai landlords who own huge amounts of capital should learn from the Korean people and be aware of the situation, competing to emulate Bu Shi's behavior. The tenants in each road and neighborhood should also do their part to save the country, doing their best to urge their landlords to use their economic strength to assist our heroic generals and soldiers on the front line and save our humiliated and endangered nation. The officials of the Citizens' United Association in each district should also be responsible for facilitating this. Respectfully presented by Liu Suijiu, Zheng Wuchang, Qian Chengxu, Cheng Yansheng.</p>
<h3>Simple Methods for Preventing Poison Gas</h3>
<p>Onions and Garlic The Shanghai Incident has occurred, and it is inevitable that the enemy will use poison gas. Although the National Salvation Association has published prevention methods, they seem too troublesome. Now, Dr. Song Guowei of the Jisheng Association has published a simple first-aid method that only requires buying onions or garlic, mixing them with water and mud, mashing them, and placing them in a pocket. If you feel the presence of such poisonous gas, you can immediately stuff them into your nostrils to avoid a major disaster.</p>
<h3>Funding Issues for the National Government's Flood Relief Committee</h3>
<p>Shanghai Incident Affects Collection and Distribution According to Sir Simpson, Deputy Chairman and General Manager of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, the sources of funds for the Flood Relief Committee can be divided into four types: (1) Donations from individuals and organizations, (2) Customs surcharge, (3) Railway passenger ticket surcharge, (4) Principal and interest fund for disaster relief bonds. Donations from all sectors have recently declined sharply. Although the Flood Relief Committee has daily income, the enthusiasm of all sectors to reward the troops resisting the Japanese invasion of Shanghai has indirectly affected flood relief donations in recent weeks. The customs surcharge was originally expected to collect 2.14 million yuan per month, but only half was collected in December last year. The income in January this year was estimated at 2 million yuan, but with the current unstable situation, it is difficult to reach the budgeted amount. As for the railway passenger ticket surcharge, the railway authorities have not yet reported and remitted it since it was levied. From the disaster relief bond fund, the Flood Relief Committee received 1.5 million yuan in January this year, and it is expected to receive 1.2 million yuan in February. According to the actual needs of the Flood Relief Committee's work, at least 3 million yuan is needed per month. Judging from the current situation and estimating the income in March, it will not exceed 1 million yuan by far. However, if the levee repair project is suspended due to insufficient funds and cannot be completed before summer, there will be a risk of flooding this year.</p>
<h3>Chinese Workers at Japanese Factories Request Relief</h3>
<p>The Local Maintenance Association Has Asked the Municipal Government to Find a Way Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., 20,800 unemployed workers from Japanese Naigai Cotton Mills elected representatives to request the Relief Section of the Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association at No. 66 Sichuan Road to find a way to maintain their livelihoods. The responsible committee members of the Relief Section replied that the Local Maintenance Association is a temporary organization, and the Relief Section is specifically for refugees in the war zone. All expenses depend on donations, and its task ends when the war ends. Moreover, the donated funds are only enough for the next few days. If they are used for other purposes, 20,000 refugees will inevitably starve to death, and it is impossible to take care of both sides. It is reported that the committee members of the Relief Section have consulted with the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau to find a proper solution so that more than 20,000 workers can maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Cotton and Yarn Industry Volunteers Defend Pudong</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton and Yarn Industry Volunteer Army, organized by the Cotton and Yarn Industry, pays attention to military discipline and style, and has been receiving formal training for four months. Since January 28th, after the outbreak of hostilities in Zhabei, the army was led by squadron leader Yang Xixian on the 29th to deploy defenses on the Shanghai-Nanhui line in Pudong, assisting the Yangsiqiao Security Corps, going out on defense day and night, and doing their best. The squadron headquarters is now located in Yangsiqiao, specifically to assist the local police and the Security Corps in maintaining local security.</p>
<h3>Ningxing Ship Safely Arrives in Ningbo Port</h3>
<p>The Ningbo ship Ningxing of the Sanbei Company departed from Shanghai to Ningbo at about 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, the voyage was safe, and arrived in Ningbo yesterday morning. It is approved to return to Shanghai in the afternoon of the same day. Yesterday, there were rumors that the ship encountered danger at the mouth of Wusong, etc., which have been found to be groundless.</p>
<h3>Continued Trial of You Bolu Case</h3>
<p>The You Bolu case has been detained and tried by the Shanghai District Court for four months. After the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, the witnesses failed to appear at the previous hearing. The continued trial has been scheduled for tomorrow, but the witnesses in this case are all in Zhabei, and their current whereabouts are unknown, and most of them cannot be summoned.</p>
<h3>Patriotism of Dock Coolies</h3>
<p>Starving to Death Rather Than Moving Munitions for the Japanese According to a report from a Feng surnamed Jiangbei person, Zhang Jiade, a foreman of Sanjing Warehouse, is from Jiangbei, and his wife is Japanese. The day before yesterday (the 12th), the Japanese army loaded a large batch of munitions to Shanghai, waiting for people to unload them. Zhang hired more than 30 coolies in advance, intending to transport them by small steamboats to Huishan Wharf. At first, the workers did not know the inside story, so they went happily. When they saw the large wooden boxes were extremely heavy, they determined that they were munitions. The workers all expressed their unwillingness. Although Zhang promised to pay each person one yuan in advance for drinking money, and another ten yuan in wages for each person after unloading, the workers still refused. Some workers even said that they would rather starve to death than do it. While they were arguing, a Japanese plainclothes team arrived, beat the workers, and arrested several of them. The rest scattered.</p>
<h3>Chauffeur Injured in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>Overturned Car on the Way, One Hand Has Been Amputated The Boy Scouts in the Car Were Unharmed Luo A'quan, a chauffeur who drives for the Da Zhonghua Dyeing Factory on Shandong Road, is known for his courage and is even more indignant at the rampant behavior of the violent Japanese. Therefore, since the outbreak of fire in Zhabei, he has voluntarily sacrificed himself to save the country, driving cars for the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to transport goods and for the Municipal Boy Scout Council to transport disaster victims, entering and exiting the war zone without any fear. Yesterday, because the Chinese and Japanese sides ceased fire, Xu Guozhi, deputy head of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Corps, and Boy Scout Zhou Dongxun, etc., borrowed a car from Luo A'quan's Dachang Refinery and drove to the former Shanghai Disaster Relief Shelter on Liuying Road, Zhabei, to rescue refugees. A total of more than 60 refugees from Hubei were rescued in two trips up and down in the afternoon, and all were sent to the Renji Hall for care. On the third trip, it was already 4:00 p.m. Because the car was borrowed, he was inevitably inexperienced. Therefore, north of Bridge No. 3 on Zhongshan Road, in order to avoid a small car, the car overturned. The chauffeur's hand bone was broken. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Corps Xu Guozhi and Zhou Dongxun immediately bandaged him and sent him to the Red Cross General Hospital on Haig Road, where the doctor amputated his hand. He has now become a disabled person, and his family is large. In order to maintain his livelihood, Xu Guozhi and others have launched a fundraising campaign, one to maintain the chauffeur's life, and one to reward the spirit of those who serve in the line of duty. If any fellow citizens of this city are willing to donate to the chauffeur who became disabled in the line of duty, please send it to Xu Guozhi, No. 334 Ningbo Road, for collection and transfer.</p>
<h3>Attention to Those Who Lost Promissory Notes</h3>
<p>Zhou Zegang wrote to say that I picked up a promissory note worth 150 yuan in front of the Qingliang Temple on the evening of the 11th. The owner of the note is Li Dilin. Because I don't know the person, I can't return it. Therefore, I would like to ask your newspaper to publish it so that the loser can contact me at the Qingliang Temple Shelter on Xinzha Road. I will return it if there is sufficient evidence. Zhou Zegang, a refugee in distress.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Announcement of the Opening of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers</h3>

<h3>Daily Record of Food Supply in the Concession</h3>
<p>Investigation by the Public Works Department on February 13: Yesterday, large quantities of fresh blood and fresh vegetables were transported to the central and eastern vegetable markets in the western district. The business of the vegetable markets is very prosperous. The situation in the northern district vegetable market has also improved. The number of vendors in the Hongkou vegetable market has also increased again, and there are also stalls on the upper floor. This is the first time since the incident occurred. The Fuzhou Road vegetable market sells a variety of things such as game and mandarin fish.</p>
<h3>White Japonica Rice Continues to Arrive in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>In recent days, not many rice boats from the interior have arrived in Shanghai. However, they continue to arrive in Caojiadu in West Shanghai. Yesterday, the opening price of high-quality white japonica rice was 15 yuan per load, and the price of medium-quality goods was 14 yuan and change. However, there is still a lot of foreign rice in the market, which is sufficient to meet the market demand. Yesterday, the opening price of No. 1 Saigon rice was 12 yuan and 40 cents, and the price of small ground rice was 10 yuan and 8 cents.</p>
<h3>The Dismantling of Li Still Unstable</h3>
<p>The sound of artillery is rumbling, how can people's hearts be at peace? Therefore, the financial market is still in a state of confusion. In addition to the usual opening of various market prices, there is very little good performance. The early market foreign li price was 7 qian 3 fen 2 li half, and the afternoon market still reached 7 qian 3 fen 5 li. Transactions were made. The early market exchange draft was 575,000 yuan, and the afternoon market was 388,000 yuan. Bank trading was slightly 3-400,000 yuan. The silver dismantling in the morning and afternoon markets was still 3 qian, the same as the previous day. The bank listing was still 1 qian 2 fen, and the water was added about 2 qian for the drawing head. Because it was Saturday afternoon, the banks were generally closed, so there was little market to record. The Qianzhuang's collection was limited. The early market for Jiangnan small foreign coins was 6 qian 7 fen, and the afternoon market was 6 qian 6 fen. Transactions were 4,500 jiao in the early market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The early market for Guangdong small foreign coins was 7 qian 1 fen 5 li, and the afternoon market was 6 qian 9 fen. The difference between the two markets was 2 fen 5 li.

<h3>Calling a Special Meeting of the League of Nations Must Be Our Country's Responsibility</h3>
<p>The Executive Council Will Not Launch It Itself</p>
<p>(Geneva) After discussing for two hours today, the League of Nations Executive Council decided not to initiate a special meeting of the League of Nations Assembly to consider the issues arising from the dispute between China and Japan. Therefore, the Chinese delegation must now bear the responsibility of convening a special meeting of the Assembly. The above resolution was decided by the twelve members of the Executive Council, with representatives from both China and Japan absent. As for the draft resolution implementing this decision of the Executive Council, it has not yet been drafted. A special committee has been appointed to discuss the wording of the resolution. The plenary session of the Executive Council will be held on February 15, at which time it will be open for</p>

<p>discussion. According to the letter from the Chief Chinese Delegate, Dr. Yen Hui-ching, to the League of Nations Secretariat, the Chinese government has formally requested that the Sino-Japanese dispute be submitted to the League of Nations Assembly. If the Executive Council were to initiate the convening itself, the Chinese government would be prepared to withdraw its request. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) 12th Dispatch: Observers here today expect that when the Council convenes a public meeting on Monday, it can announce the convening of a special session of the League of Nations Assembly, based on China's sole application, to consider the Sino-Japanese dispute. It is reported that during today's closed-door meeting of the twelve council members, some council members, including the British representative, Simon, strongly opposed the Council automatically convening based on China's request. Therefore, it was decided to hold another public meeting on Monday to discuss whether the method of convening the assembly should be initiated automatically by the Council or independently applied for by China, or whether an agreement can be reached. According to Hu Shih-tse of the Chinese delegation, China today directly requested the Council to convene the assembly. If the Council is unable to convene it, China will formally apply to convene it itself. Therefore, it is now believed that if the council members still cannot agree on a method of convening by Monday, China will be forced to apply independently. (12th, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Paris newspapers do not speak highly of China's request to convene the League of Nations Assembly. L'Echo de Paris stated that this move will force Japan to take severe military action to restore its prestige. Le Figaro stated that what China gains in the League of Nations Assembly</p>
<p>will not be much more than in the League of Nations Executive Council. Although it can greatly publicize its principles, it will greatly weaken the League of Nations' ability. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>British League of Nations Union's Proposal to Maintain Peace</h3>
<p>Advocates the League of Nations Should Cooperate with the United States</p>
<p>London The Council of the British League of Nations Union passed a resolution today, advocating that the League of Nations Assembly be convened and that the League of Nations should cooperate with the United States to exercise any diplomatic and economic pressure necessary to restore peace in the Far East. According to the proposals drafted by the League of Nations Union, they include prohibiting the export of arms, and for any party that continues to refuse the five methods of resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute by Britain and the United States, world ports should refuse to import its goods, refuse financial facilities, and withdraw diplomatic representatives. The League of Nations Union hopes that the League of Nations countries will send notes to the Chinese and Japanese governments, reiterating the document sent by the US State Department on January 7. This document asks China and Japan to pay attention to the Nine-Power Treaty and declares that the United States does not recognize the legality of any situation that has become a reality, or recognize any treaty created between China and Japan in a way that is contrary to the Pact of Paris. The League of Nations Union asks the League of Nations Executive Council to endorse this statement by the United States and declare that the Executive Council adopts the same attitude as the United States on this matter. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London The resolution passed by the British League of Nations Union</p>
<p>has generated a good response in London. The Manchester Guardian stated that Japan has indicated that the League of Nations Charter can easily be turned into a waste of paper. If we intend to use the Charter as a tool to maintain world peace, we must resolutely implement its provisions as we would other international obligations. The Daily Chronicle stated that if the resolution of the League of Nations Union is abandoned, the only option is to accept Japan's demands and allow it to trample on all international treaties with force, replacing them with its own unbridled will to become the overlord of the East. The newspaper also commented on the mood in Britain, saying that the repercussions of Japan's demands on India must be extremely different, not to mention Australia and Canada. (10</p>

<h3>Chinese Embassy in the United States Issues Statement on the Shanghai Situation</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Chinese Embassy today issued a statement to reporters, stating that all international mediation has failed and Japan has rejected all peace talks. The Chinese Embassy has also sent the same report to the US State Department. The statement said that although China is willing to accept reasonable peace conditions, Japan has rejected the conditions put forward by the representatives of various countries. Therefore, China has to persist to the end to resist Japanese aggression. The statement concluded that the Chinese people have deeply understood Japan's attempt to invade the three northeastern provinces of China since the Russo-Japanese War. According to reports, news from Shanghai has been informally confirmed, saying that British Minister Lampson's mediation has been disappointed because Japan insists that the Chinese army must withdraw to a safe distance outside the concession before negotiations can begin, while China says that this condition is absolutely unacceptable. (Guomin News Agency, 12th)</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee</h3>

<h3>Shen Honglie Talks About the Tranquility of the Coastal Areas of Shandong Province</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Ge Guangting and Shen Honglie arrived in Jinan today. Shen said that Qingdao and the coastal areas under his jurisdiction are all tranquil. The Japanese consul in Qingdao is strictly cracking down on vagrants. Tsuda, the commander of the Japanese naval forces stationed in Qingdao, expressed great satisfaction with the security in Shandong. The Japanese warships responsible for the coastal areas of North China include two large ships and seven small destroyers, with Qingdao as their base. Currently, one large ship has gone to Shanghai, and Qingdao only has one Kuma-class flagship with 600-700 soldiers. Each destroyer has only 110 soldiers, and only 40-50 can land. Now, each time they are dispatched, they notify us, and there are no military preparations. The destroyers patrol the Yantai, Longkou, and Tanggu areas and are stationed in Lushun. Ge Guangting is scheduled to go to Ping tomorrow to visit Zhang. Shen will return to Qingdao on the same day to take charge. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>

Chiang of the Central Military Region is only summing it up. In fact, it must be commanded by Han. We hope that the strong enemy will not oppress us too much, and that we can coexist peacefully. There are more than 200,000 elite soldiers in Shandong and Henan, and Han can deal with them. Qingdao has Commander Shen's naval and land defenses, and he has a good grasp of the situation. Han and Shen expressed extreme modesty and said that they are determined to obey orders and overcome national difficulties together. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Xiao Focheng said that Guangdong has no intention of forming a government, and Sun has decided to postpone his return to Guangdong. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Speech</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Premier Wang Jingwei's speech on the essence of resisting while negotiating, roughly stated that this time China is not yielding to Japan's violence, but is acting in legitimate self-defense. It must have the greatest determination and the greatest sacrifice to obtain the final result. Being overly timid is not allowed, and making grand speeches is even more forbidden. It must be known that in the past few decades, China's military and economy, in terms of material things, have clearly fallen behind others. Not to mention that even the organization is immature and incomplete. If we recognize this point, we must start with national unity. With a vast territory and a large population, China can confront Japan, a wealthy and powerful country. Even if one or two cities and towns unfortunately fall into their hands, everyone in China will resist and resist everywhere. Even if Japan has two or three million elite soldiers, it cannot spread them everywhere. In the world, there are armies that can be defeated, but no nations that can be destroyed. It is necessary to firmly remember these two sentences. If they are carried out tirelessly, Japan will inevitably have a day when its strength is exhausted, and the major powers will eventually rise up and overthrow it together. As for the diplomatic aspect, China has this time</p>
<p>sufficient reasons to demand that the countries that signed the League of Nations, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact intervene in Japan. Since China has this reason, it must never give up diplomacy. Do not think that diplomacy is useless and resolutely ignore it. Not only to the various countries, but also to Japan. What Japan hopes from me is to sign conditions that lose power and humiliate the country. However, since September 18th of last year, the Nanjing government could have signed at any time, but it has never been willing to sign. Recently, it would rather move the capital to Luoyang to plan for long-term resistance, but it has never been willing to sign. The determination of China can also be seen. Japan</p>
<p>will eventually abandon this unobtainable hope, and then there will be Sino-Japanese negotiations. (Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Yen Hui-ching's Speech at the Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>Our Country Does Not Want to Beg for Pity or Seek Assistance</p>
<p>We Only Ask That the Countries That Signed the Treaty</p>
<p>Fulfill Their Obligations</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chief Chinese Delegate, Dr. Yen Hui-ching, stated in his speech at the Disarmament Conference today, roughly stating that our country and people, in this time of life-and-death crisis, do not want to beg for pity from other countries, nor do we want to seek assistance from other countries. We only ask that the countries that signed the solemn treaty fulfill their obligations. China has a history of more than 2000 years and has experienced many storms, and has always been able to turn danger into safety. Therefore, we dare to believe that this time we can still cross to the other shore. China is willing to endorse the preliminary suggestion made by the League of Nations Assembly on November 7, 1930, to use a military truce as the first step in the Disarmament Conference. However, the Chinese government believes that this proposal and the fate of the Disarmament Conference itself are linked to the outcome of the Liaoning case. Today, the Chinese people's heartache over the arms issue is more acute than that of any other country present. The result of this struggle to resist extremely cruel aggression from abroad will inevitably determine China's future military policy. We, in principle, endorse various forms of disarmament. Sir Simon has put forward two principles: one is to reduce and limit troops, and the other is to distinguish military equipment. The original intention is that those used for aggression should be abolished. China approves of these two principles. The danger of the giant war machine has been clearly revealed. In 1914, Europe therefore gave birth to imperialism and inflicted great disasters on the world. Today, Asia is once again giving birth to imperialism. In recent months, painful experience has shown that the introduction of war in the new era gives the attacker a complete advantage, especially a sudden and undeclared war. Large warships, tanks, heavy artillery, and bomber aircraft, we have already</p>
<p>seen them in the war. The League of Nations' lofty purpose of protecting member states from war and protecting member states from the invasion of their territorial integrity or political independence has been defeated. Dr. Yen also endorsed Qin Diou's declaration that disarmament alone is not enough to guarantee peace. Then, he briefly described the situation in the Far East, saying that China has strictly restrained the anger of the people. Therefore, in four months of tension, there has never been a case of harassment of a single Japanese person in the territory under China's jurisdiction. We have heard of bandits in the three northeastern provinces. We dare to ask impartial observers to present facts to clarify this. Recently, the Japanese army attacked Shanghai again. We have asked the League of Nations to intervene. Now, unless the people deeply believe that the League of Nations is not only an agency, but also has the power and the courage to exercise power when the facts are clear, there can be no security. Dr. Yen concluded calmly, Ladies and gentlemen, what do you intend to do about this? Will the League of Nations Charter and the Paris Convention be allowed to fall into pieces? Will you uphold the dignity of the treaties? Or will the peace mechanism be destroyed and the barbaric forces that were overthrown ten years ago be restored to their old positions? The success of the Disarmament Conference depends entirely on your answers to these questions.</p>

Durio finally demanded that the French troops currently stationed in Shanghai be withdrawn immediately, because the role of these troops is to assist Japan's aggressive actions. (Guomin</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>A telegram from Nanning, for the attention of all newspapers and legal entities: Our 19th Route Army has resisted the violent Japanese and protected our territory. Their great achievements are admired both at home and abroad. However, the isolated army is fighting a fierce battle and is inevitably exhausted. Recently, we have heard that Japan is increasing its troops to reinforce Shanghai, intending to occupy Wusong. We implore the central government to quickly provide reinforcements to strengthen our prestige, and we also request that the anti-Japanese plan be issued as soon as possible, so that the troops across the country can have something to follow. The officers and soldiers of our 4th Army have volunteered to assist Heilongjiang and arrived in Quanzhou early. We have repeatedly requested orders from the central government to facilitate the army's movements, but we have not yet received a reply. The situation in Shanghai is serious. If the central government approves the 4th Army to assist Heilongjiang, please issue a clear order as soon as possible, or weigh the distance and urgency and order them to assist Shanghai first. The remaining units of the 4th Group Army are waiting for orders. We respectfully submit this telegram and request your consideration. Bai Chongxi bows and sings.</p>
<p>News Highlights</p>
<h3>Conditions Inside Japan After the Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>(Translated Compilation from Japanese Newspapers) (Continued (</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, the Japanese financial world has been greatly shocked and plunged into great chaos. The following are excerpts from the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo Hochi Shimbun, and Tokyo Jiji Shimbun regarding economic news: The chaotic state of our country's (Japan's) financial world this time not only affects Sino-Japanese relations, but also has a significant impact on the United States, the United Kingdom, and the League of Nations. It is difficult to predict the future development of the situation, and the increase in the uneasy atmosphere in the economic world is increasing day by day. Since the first of this month, the stock market, government bonds, raw silk, and cotton yarn markets have all plummeted. The most dangerous thing is the chaos of the sellers, which is almost impossible to deal with. The exchange rate against the US dollar has skyrocketed, and it is deeply worrying that the United States misunderstands our country's (Japan's) position, which has caused great pain to the financial industry. And the American banking industry said that if China and Japan go to war in the Orient, they will inevitably raise debts from the financial circles in New York and London, and the United States has expressed its refusal. In the future, the supply of domestic and foreign funds may be hindered. In addition, the import volume in January exceeded 45 million yuan, the export volume exceeded 70 million yuan, and the import volume exceeded 110 million yuan. After the Shanghai Incident, the industrial world has been in a very dangerous situation, and the future trend is even more unimaginable. The war insurance for Shanghai mail ships has been rejected by the insurance companies. The textile industry in China may be closed for a long time, and there is no possibility of reopening it for a while. As for rice, the domestic output in Japan in the sixth year was an unprecedented poor harvest, with a reduction of 12 million koku. Recently, due to the Shanghai Incident, rice prices have continued to rise, and ordinary living goods have also skyrocketed. As the suffering of consumers increases, an uneasy atmosphere has arisen in society. The French government has increased additional taxes on Japanese imports, and foreign trade has been affected. The most worrying thing is that the anti-Japanese atmosphere in southern China is very strong, such as Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and Singapore. After hearing about the Shanghai Incident, the anti-Japanese fervor in the Yangtze River basin has increased sharply. Although the import ports have recently been changed and sold to various places through Qingdao, the anti-Japanese situation in Tianjin and Beiping has deteriorated, and the transfer of goods has become very difficult. In the past, whenever the Lunar New Year came, trade between China and our country (Japan) was most prosperous, but now it has completely stagnated. Therefore, the future of the economic world is bleak and full of infinite pessimism. Finance: Since the Shanghai Incident broke out suddenly, Minister of the Navy Osumi and Minister of Finance Takahashi consulted on the allocation of funds on the afternoon of the 1st of this month. As a result, the administrative officials of the Ministry of Finance and the Navy began to prepare the budget for the required expenses, together with the related expenses of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Army, and added 20 million yuan. However, in order to meet the current urgent needs, the public debt resources were used to fill the gap in accordance with the second emergency measure. Later, after discussions among the cabinet members, it suddenly increased to 40 million yuan. It is found that the most urgent expenses currently are the responsibility expenses for the general election, totaling 3.3 million yuan (Internal Affairs 1.862, Justice 563, Communications 962). Adding other expenses for Justice and Communications, the total cost of the general election is 4.276 million yuan. It is said that the 3.5 million yuan for the Manchurian Incident is also included. However, since the gold export ban was lifted, the outflow of cash has made the financial situation very tight. The budget for the sixth year was already tight. The budget formulation policy for the seventh year was submitted to the cabinet meeting on the 2nd of this month for decision. Now, the sudden increase in this huge temporary expenditure, with no other resources to tap, has to rely on public debt. However, the people feel unable to bear the burden of national debt, so the future difficulties are truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>Production: According to the Hochi Shimbun, Japan suffered a drought last year, and harvests were greatly reduced throughout the country. Rice production decreased by 20 million koku, and economic panic and increased unemployment led to reports of people starving to death every day. According to a report from the Iwate Prefecture Health Department, the mortality rate of farmers, just in the four counties of Ninohe, Kunohe, Iwate, and Waga, from October to December last year, reached 1,454 people who died of starvation in three months, an average of about 16 or 17 people per day. The main causes of death were anemia, lack of food, indigestion, and malnutrition.</p>
<h3>Wakatsuki Violently Beaten by Thugs</h3>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported that at 1:00 PM on the 5th, former Prime Minister and President of the Minseito Party, Wakatsuki Reijiro, was giving a speech at the Osaka City Central Public Hall when a thug suddenly jumped onto the stage and violently beat Wakatsuki. Wakatsuki was unable to escape, and the whole place was in an uproar. Fortunately, officers from the Tenma Police Station on the scene immediately grabbed the perpetrator and took him to the police station for interrogation. It is said that the perpetrator lives at 332 Morishojikitakashimachi, Higashinari Ward, Osaka City, and his name is Uehara Kiyoshi, age 27. Because he was dissatisfied with the Minseito Party, he took this action. Wakatsuki suffered a dislocated left wrist from the beating.</p>
<h3>Situation in Jiujiang Quite Serious</h3>
<p>Japanese Urgently Demanding Debt Repayment from Nanxun Railway. Japanese Warships Arrive in Xunpu, Residents Fleeing.</p>
<p>A correspondence from Nanchang: Jiujiang is an important town on the Yangtze River and has a large number of Japanese residents. Therefore, many Japanese warships have recently arrived in Xunpu, causing a serious situation. The Japanese debt group is also demanding debt repayment from the Ministry of Railways and the Nanxun Railway Bureau more actively than before, threatening to take over the railway if the money is not repaid. The Nanxun Railway is over 300 li long and owes a total of over 10 million Japanese yen in principal and interest to Japanese creditors. The Japanese creditors have repeatedly stated that they will take over the railway. Now that the Japanese are wantonly provoking incidents in various ports of our country, the debt group is taking the opportunity to carry out their plan. However, the Nanxun Railway is the throat of Jiangxi Province, and Jiujiang is a fortress on the Yangtze River, which is of great importance. When the Shanghai Incident occurred, Pacification Commissioner Zhu Shaoliang ordered Jiujiang Garrison Commander Guo Su to supervise the army, police, and law enforcement to carefully protect foreigners and consolidate local security. The central government also dispatched a division of troops to garrison along the river and key points to make thorough arrangements for defense. According to a message from the Pacification Commissioner's Office, Commissioner Zhu received a telegram from Garrison Commander Guo Jiangshou of Jiujiang, reporting the situation in Jiujiang, stating that three Japanese warships arrived in Xunpu on the 3rd. It is not known whether they will dock here or go elsewhere. Today, another telegram from Commander Guo stated that the three Japanese warships have left Xunpu for other destinations, but Japanese residents have entrusted their luggage to Nisshin Steamship Company and are preparing to leave Xunpu. Our army is prepared to protect the soil and protect foreigners, so there are no unusual circumstances along the river, and Xunpu is still peaceful. According to returning guests from Jiujiang, Xunpu is superficially calm, but many residents are moving, which is actually just disturbing themselves.</p>
