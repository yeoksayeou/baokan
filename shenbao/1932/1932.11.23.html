<p>調處中日爭案國聯行政會陷僵境全部問題勢將提交特别大會</p>
<h3>行政會今日下午再開將由李頓解釋報吿書</h3>
<p>外部辯正日意見書起草完竣松岡遍訪各大國代表緩和對日空氣</p>
<p>（南京）政府當局二十二晚接顧維鈞來電報吿二十二日無會、二十三日議程㈠李頓答復日代表對報吿書爭辯各點、㈡由各國代表質詢日代表、詢問日政府有無和平解决中日事件之誠意、二十四二十五停會、二十六再開會、將報吿書及本次行政院會議紀錄提出通過、移交十九人特委會及國聯大會、外部爲駁斥日意見書所草擬之辯正書、已起草完竣定二十三發表、至日意見書内關於各項專門問題者、亦由外部訓電駐日内瓦三代表逐點相機駁斥（二十二日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）政府要人談、接各方報吿、及外國報紙所載消息、證明世界各國對日本之侵略中國、已十分明瞭、最近更因日本意見書之發表、其遷怒於第三者之狂態益顯、其存心與和平爲敵、心目中已無其他國家存在、是以日内瓦空氣、對日已日趨惡化、我國正宜乘此時機、内則精誠團結、作外交之後盾、外則聯絡友邦、爲正義之聲援、（二十二日專電）</p>
<p>▲電通二十一日日内瓦電本日在理事會之演說、日本松岡代表關於滿洲問題、斷然拒絕變更日本之立塲、中國代表顧維鈞謂接到滿洲問題如不能滿足解决、則排日排貨有益擴大之虞之報吿、於是兩者發生正面衝突、、已包含重大危機而呈停頓狀態</p>
<p>▲路透二十二日日内瓦電國聯方面頗覺松岡與顧維鈞皆純在絕對不同意之點發言、而不根據李頓報吿書謀取雙方所可同意之點將使行政院工作甚感困難、因此問題性質至爲複雜、不能有美滿之决定也、行政院各理事刻方作私人談話、商榷明日開會事、但以目前而言、此間衆人之注意點今日暫移注於德國與軍縮會之問題、德外長牛賴資僅能在此小住數日、星期六日即須離此、</p>
<p>▲路透二十一日日内瓦電國聯行政院之討論、就現象察之、未必持久、全部問題將儘速提交國聯大會之特會、而由大會定决復組十九特委會之問題、</p>
<p>▲電通社二十一日日内瓦電下次理事會决於二十三日下午三時半開會、凡勒拉議長與英法等大國之意、擬在此期内與調查團委員及關係國巨頭往來、防阻下次理事會之空洞討論、希望爲實質的進展、</p>
<p>（南京）國聯行政院二十一日已開會、由中日兩國代表政詞、二十三日專凡由李頓爵士致詞、對報吿書作詳細之解釋、繼以各國代表演說、此爲國聯行政院正式討論李頓報吿書之開始、據外交界觀察、李頓二十三日之演詞、與其十九日之播音演講將爲同一之内容、而更擴大詳晰、李頓演詞中所述調查團不承認所謂「滿洲國」、及日本承認「滿洲國」係屬無理一節、外交界認爲至爲公正、且極關重要、並信行政院必能接受李頓之公正意見、於會議開幕前正式聲明不承認「滿洲國」、至李頓所述用會議方法、和平解决糾紛、亦致無窮之期望於國聯、而希其迅速圓滿實現、云（二十二日中央社電）</p>
<p>▲華聯社二十二日東京電據日方消息、松岡洋右於昨日下午七時往訪法國代表彭古、以某種條件懇請法國援日、今日再訪英意德各代表、求其援助、</p>
<p>（南京）日代表團昨由法向外務省報吿對國聯策略、㈠决在行政院内積極活動、取得列强之諒解、控制大會、㈡聲明誠意擁護關聯盟約及非戰公約、以慰各弱小國、而免在大會鼓噪、㈢對調查團報吿書中有利點加以演述、不利點加以反駁、力避與列强發生意見、務使帝國收獲實利、㈣在會議中力避與中國方面發生激烈辯論、表面上予以提携、㈤促成滿洲問題之解决、移由中日「滿」三方面直接交涉、爲最後辦法、（二十二日申時社電）</p>
<p>▲路透二十二日倫敦電處理中國東三省問題者、應爲國聯行政院乎、抑爲國聯大會乎、言者頗多爭論、外交界乃有一種新主張、欲依照一九二一年華盛頓條約之規定、召集此約簽字國之特殊會議、處理此案、如是則美國亦將參加討論、保守黨每日電聞今日社論言滿洲一案、與世界一般問題有重要關係、力勸政府如不幸有干涉之必要、應决定據以行事之根本原則、否則英國將陷入甚危險之糾紛中、英國對於滿洲問題、不宜有援助中國要求、致使日本退出國聯之拘束、蓋軍縮會之前途、將因此崩潰、而海上軍縮之結果、將大不利英國及世界各處也云、</p>
<h3>十九特委會之組織</h3>
<p>（南京）外交界息、出席此次國聯行政院會議者計有德·英·法·意·西班牙·波蘭·墨西哥·愛爾蘭·瓜地瑪拉·巴拿馬·挪威·捷克·中·日等十四國、至十九國委員會之組織、上述十四國中、中日兩國除外、尙有瑞士·哥倫比亞·匈牙利·瑞典·比利時·南斯拉夫·荷蘭·等七國云、（二十二日中央社電、</p>
<h3>傀儡代表徘徊巴黎</h3>
<p>▲華聯社二十二日東京電僞組織傀儡丁士源由巴黎往日内瓦、被瑞士政府拒絕入境、目下徘徊巴黎郊外、進退維谷乃電吿關東軍及東京日外部周旋、因傀儡不能入日内瓦、故日外部焦急萬分、</p>
<h3>美國嚴守緘默</h3>
<p>▲哈瓦斯二十二日華盛頓電國務院自日内瓦議會開始以後、因恐外界誤會、美國對於滿洲問題之態度將極端保持緘默、但消息靈通人士相信、國聯會對於中國若保持有利態度、則列强均將宣言拒絕承認「滿洲國」、至美國採取此種態度之意、懹之已久云、</p>
<h3>顧維鈞博士駁斥松岡謬論</h3>
<p>▲路透社二十一日日内瓦電今日午後顧維鈞博士在國聯行政院特會、代表中國發言、顧本擬就演稿、但未全照此發揮、顧首先答辯今晨日代表松岡所發之言論、謂松岡之言人若信之、則無異信日本爲一温柔之小羊而在中國之脅吻中、但世人幸有李頓報吿書、以證其說之不確、松岡所言各點渠欲保留批評、但現願略言一二、</p>
<p>▲弁髦神聖條約縱假定松岡之言不謬、然依然可疑問者、日本軍事侵略之合理、究至何種程度乎、如世人對於凱洛格非戰公約條文之解釋、與日本同、則遵守此種公約究有何益乎、渠以爲不如將自衛之性質與意義、就非戰公約本身之條文解釋之、較爲穩當也顧言至此、乃宣讀中政府對於李頓報吿書之意見文、首言渠以中國陪員之資格、在東三省備受毫無理由之限制與禁阻、以致旣未能視察發生事變之地點、亦不能設法使中國人證得出現於李頓調查團之前、而日本陪員之在中國本境各處、則享有自由、兩相比較、待遇懸殊、</p>
<p>▲妨阻中國統一中國在建設過程中所遇最大困難之一、即爲日本屢次阻其實現之舉動、日本一面不斷的向全世界責備中國不統一、一面繼續進行其阻止中國統一之政策、日本究欲中國統一與否、實爲問題、日人顯以中國統一、將不利於日本開拓政策爲慮、</p>
<p>▲威脅遠東和平日人之大陸政策、爲數百年日本武士道敎訓之結晶品、其目的在征服亞洲、而以中國爲第一階級、此種大陸政策、誠遠東和平之大患也、其危險尤大者、在此政策之後復有莫可控制之軍黨、此黨爲日本所有戰爭機關最有力者之一、而欲以鐵拳實施其主張、</p>
<p>▲抵貨消極自衛中國人民之所以繼續抵制運動者、即爲反對日本此種侵略政策而起、此種不期然而然之民衆運動、任何政府不能完全與之脫離、此爲合法自衛之方法、中國中央政府唯有默許之耳、但中政府嚴密監視之、此層已爲李頓報吿書所證實、故自日軍開始侵略東三省以來、絕少發生意外事件、中政府在現狀之下、即立法抵制日商與日貨、而製定實行抵制之更一致的方法、亦未可謂爲不合情理、但中國迄未有此舉、亦足見中政府忍耐温和的政策之特質矣、有組織的抵制之實施、是否與友好關係不相抵觸之問題、非至另一先决問題已决定後、不能發生、此先决問題爲何、則在日本無端侵略中國土地之時、中日關係是否仍可認爲友好是也、中國固欲籍國聯謀取和平解决、但中國覺有在可能時制止侵略的軍隊陸續前進之必要、中國乃擇此消極抵抗之形式、此舉較合人道以其不流血也若用武力抵抗、則流血必不可免如謂中國不應抵制、則直剝削合法與和平的自衛工具矣、</p>
<p>▲日軍行動無理李頓報吿書已證實中國所稱瀋陽事件不能爲日本軍事行動之理由一說、瀋陽事件旣不能爲日軍在該處行動之理由、則日軍之於是夜同時侵略長春吉林與營口之中國土地、更無理由可言、試觀去年十月十日之錦州事件、尤爲日當道缺乏信義之證、日人旣摧毀錦州吉林及東三省許多地方之管理權、而猶時以東三省未有公共秩序爲言李頓報吿書之第一百二十七頁、言及日當道對於國聯雖發莊嚴之担保、然仍進行其威脅與同化方法、此言亦殊可注意、</p>
<p>▲反抗世界輿情顧博士於叙述本年一月上海事件後、謂猶有一事爲日本反抗世界之駭人憑據者、爲日本之正式承認「滿洲國」、完全不顧國聯盟約與國際條約之莊嚴担任、以及其屢次對國聯行政會而發之諾言、日人苟不欲取中國治權而代有之、則日軍在南滿之行爲將無目的、中國以此爲慮、而日當道則憤然駁斥之、然而中立性質之通信社、如聯合通信社及路透電社等、固有日人積極活動攫取東三省民政權之報吿也、</p>
<p>▲保留賠償要求顧博士繼稱此問題之解决、應交國聯大會之特會爲之、中國旣有不受外來侵略之担保矣、今不能令中國因此侵略之結果、而放棄其在被侵略前所有之權利、李頓報吿書贊成中政府之態度、亦以爲中國與他國間之任何討論、必須於國聯盟約與非戰公約下、根據中國之權利而舉行之、、中政府準備以任何建議與此大原則相合者、爲討論之基礎、中政府保留因日本侵略行爲要求賠償之權</p>
<p>▲撤兵義務未盡日本在去年國聯屢次决議案下之撤兵義務、今猶存在、撤兵今猶屬必要、乃中日爭點根本解决之先决條件、軍事佔領之壓力、以及因用武力而得的已成事實之壓力、先須銷滅此乃必要之舉、苟不承認此必要則此爭執之解决、、不能適當討論也</p>
<p>▲迅採有效措置李頓報吿書叙述東三省時局眞相、明白周詳、今時機已至、國聯應採行迅速而有效之行爲、主張公道、維持世界和平、唯賴根據國際條約所規定之公道與正義原則、對於中日衝突予以迅速而有效力之解决、此中國之所期望者也云顧博士之言、有一部份專述日本自十六世紀至田中上日皇書之歷史上文件、以證明日本對華始終不變之野心、行政院晚六時五分始散會、下次會議定星期三日午後三時半舉行、</p>
<p>▲路透二十一日日内瓦電松岡今日語客、顧維鈞博士所陳各節、、並無新頴之處渠對於中代表有禮貌的發言如發自一個老友者、大爲欽佩、至於顧博士所言及之田中奏摺、渠於必要時可指出僞造者之姓氏、渠以爲未有駁斥中國陳訴之必要、但渠僅準備詳述中國之狀况云、</p>
<h3>日以退盟恫嚇國聯中人並不介意</h3>
<p>▲國民社二十二日日内瓦電國聯中有許多代表向來對於日人退出國聯之恫嚇、視爲無足介意者、今日已較前稍加注意、但仍罕有信日人之定欲實行者、蓋日來報紙解釋日本對李頓報吿意見書及松岡在國聯演說、認爲表示日代表已受有國聯行動不能使日人滿意時不妨退出之命、因此各代表亦轉而加以注意、并同時非正式討論南太平洋委託日本統治各島問題、及其能否足爲阻止日本退出國聯之有力份子、但因此又引起嚴重問題則日本旣經受委託統治後、是否願爲國聯取去、再委託他國統治是也某觀察時事者稱、此諸島爲日本對於東方攻擊第一道海軍防線、雖散居十萬方哩之洋面、但其位置足以危及美國與菲律濱間、及巴拿馬運河與菲律濱間之交通綫、此間海軍專家皆謂日美若在太平洋海戰、則此諸島日本大可作爲海軍根據地、以阻遏美艦、勢將使美艦隊非得英艦隊之助、雙方夾攻不易奏功、該諸島對於日本旣重要若是、日人必不肯輕易放棄、設國聯軍果將改畀他國、則美國亦在所必爭、又有某觀察時事者以爲萬一日本竟退出國聯、而不肯放棄代管諸島、則勢將召集英美法日四國條約簽字國會議矣、</p>
<p>英民治同盟發表重要宣言</p>
<h3>日本縱退出國聯仍將受盟約約束</h3>
<p>▲國民社二十一日倫敦電今日民治同盟由維素·藍斯堡（工黨領袖）·與韋爾斯諸人簽名發一宣言、宣稱、中日爭執中之危機正在發展、將來不僅對於遠東前途、即對於軍縮問題、亦將有足以决定運命之影響、今國聯倘有日人所認爲不利之决議後、日本勢將决定退出國聯、固屬可慮、雖然有一點須明瞭者、即日本縱决定退出國聯、苟非其按照國聯盟約所負之國際義務、悉經履行之後、則仍將受盟約之束縛、再若英國表示亦準備與美國合作、共同維持九國公約後、或亦仍可阻免日本之退出國聯也、最後民治同盟又建議、倘國聯大會宣吿日本爲違犯條約之侵約國後、則各國應立即禁止一應軍械子彈售與日本云、</p>
<h3>各國言論一斑</h3>
<p>▲路透二十一日巴黎電今日僅有兩報有社評、討論東省事件、而此兩社論足可代表兩極端派之主張、向取親日主義之</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>極右派報紙「自由報」謂、日本係在一無政府狀態區域维持秩序、實爲對於人類盡一種義務、而親華派之社會黨報紙「人民報」則稱、國聯應维持本身之威信壓迫日本將東省交還中國云云、各方咸認國聯已遭遇重大危機云、</p>
<p>▲路透二十二日巴黎電法國報紙對於中日兩國代表之議論、殊少批評、巴黎晨報今日社說、謂察雙方各執之理由、顯未有和解式調停之適當手續、國聯於此似宜謹謝不敏、聽他人處理耳、况國聯大會主張各岐、尤不能不出於此途云、小巴黎人報詰問國聯行政院之資格、謂此事應交國聯大會辦理、因能决定此種問題者、厥爲大會云、</p>
<p>▲路透二十二日柏林電德國僅日耳曼尼亞報批評日内瓦昨日會議事、謂國聯對於滿洲問題將不變其故態、在過去十四個月中、毫無决定今將依然擱置之、而無决定也滿洲衝突之慘劇、表明國聯乃一個不充分不完全之機關、不足以執行如赫禮歐在其建設計畫中所提議之重要工作、英法從未有斷然行動之熱忱、滿洲問題之一再拖延、英法與有關焉德國最所注意者、在避免一種前例、恐德國將來易地而處、將受此前例之惡影響也云該報最後作悲觀語、謂遠東衝突、在日内瓦銷滅之希望、直等於零云、</p>
<p>▲路透二十一日哇太華電加拿大對於日内瓦之辯論、暫不加以批評、須俟國聯討論中日爭案時、再發表意見、首相邊尼特今日在下院答覆問話、謂加拿大駐日内瓦之代表對於中日關係、將抱坦白無私之態度、政府未將關於土地爭端之辯論詳加研究、遽加評議、殊不適宜云、</p>
<p>▲路透二十二日東京電各晚報均於顯著之地位、登載昨日日内瓦行政院會議中日代表之演詞、惟皆未作評論、各報雖注重日内瓦國聯之辯論、而尤注重鐵道大臣與内務大臣關於土木工程程序預算經費之爭端、衆意如不能商妥和解辦法、則内閣有破裂之虞、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日内瓦以外之中日爭鬭又　玄</h3>
<p>一中日爭鬭之焦點</p>
<p>國際聯盟行政會議。已於二十一日午前十一時在日内瓦開會。其主要議題爲討論「李頓報吿書。」中日兩國外交戰綫於是展開。論人選我國代表顧維鈞氏。爲當今外交界之能手。日方之松岡洋右尤爲彼軍部及外務省所共同推舉之幹才日本雖盛倡國聯對東方問題「認識不足」之論。而於國際外交。則守步留心。其於李頓報吿之反駁意見書。對我國乃盡其誣辱之能事。他方面則一力爲侵略獨占肆其詭辯。謂日本之襲擊東北三省係爲東洋和平。出乎自衛的必要。爲擁護日本之安全。爲維持條約之神聖然而叩之實際。其於國際條約也。則九國公約非戰公約等世界共相遵守之國際條約。均因日軍刀槍所及而變作廢紙。東北三省原來秩序。雖不見佳。人民尙可勉强安居。自被日軍暴力刦奪之後。幾至路斷行人野無靑草矣。安寗之謂何。和平其何在。</p>
<p>國聯之無力。吾儕固早言之。蓋現時世界諸國困於經濟衰退。英美法諸國。雖名爲領導者。其實外强中乾。無實力足以裁制日本之暴力與獨占。故吾儕對於仰求外人之援助。及於國聯範圍中尋覓公理正義。認爲必無結果。</p>
<p>是故在對日内瓦外交以外中國對日問題。應有一種仰給於自力之實際的民族爭鬭。具堅强之决必立恒久之計劃。然後乃能與吾人當前之强敵。作必死之戰也。</p>
<p>茲請推而論之。我國對東北問題。兵力旣不堅實。民生尤爲疲敝。實我失敗之重要原素。且我國領地廣博。天産殷富。而人口稠密。更具今後市塲擴張之特色。列國且各自擴大其在華商業勢力。我其甘心後人。永作人之轉販耶。其奮起而自立耶。目前各國所缺乏而又極苦痛者爲商品過剩。市場窄小。我乃空有廣大市場而不能善爲利用。致爲强敵所乘。日本名爲强國。在經濟上於天然産物。如礦産林産以及農業産品。均極有限而不能自給。其所特長乃在於纖維工業。我國雖比較落後。欲在短時期内與日本作經濟的競爭。尙非難事。矧日本現時已感覺市場之窄狹。有物品而無處銷售。惟一市塲。祗在我國。如我能及時奮起。與之作積極的經濟競爭。利用自國市塲而與粗製濫造之貨物對抗。無論我國如何軟弱。亦應有持久之抗力。</p>
<p>二國民總動員</p>
<p>日本襲取我東北三省之前。號召其國民之惟一口號。爲國難臨頭。借口「</p>
<p>滿洲」爲其國防綫生命線以激勵其國民。故於九一八事變未發生之前。多門第二師團。室第二十師團。即已秘密動員開赴南滿路一帶。實行襲占遼吉兩省。雖該地軍事當局採取無抵抗主義。而熱血健兒。不肯退避。情甘爲民族奮鬭而犧牲。蹶起於田畝之間。持陳舊器械而與日軍相對抗。雖未致日本之死命。恢復失地。而日本軍閥手忙脚亂之情已現。國民動員之口號。則已唱遍於日本國内。除製造九一八事變原有約四萬兵力之外。復增加「西」第八師團。廣瀨第十師團。松木第十四師團。及其他各特種部隊於「滿洲」合計人數。不下十萬。其結果非特未能平定東北。且致該地方之秩序。愈見混亂。然而彼之野心。并未因此稍戢。且復爲經濟的動員。實行普遍的傾消政策。使中國製造品在中國市塲消路窒息。然後日本獨占致策乃得展開。帝國主義的侵略方有出路。</p>
<p>當此時也。我國處此萬難境遇中。遭受彼武力的壓迫。經濟的環攻。欲自行打開新生路。僅乞憐於樽俎之折衝。恐終無自全之道。惟有整備我國民戰線。一面竭其全力於。經濟的建設。毅然抛棄往昔之空談。埋頭工作。整頓内政。恢復舊有産業開發新工業。則現時之失業　衆。將逐漸消失。而社會不安景象。亦自然清掃。不觀乎蘇聯乎。彼現行之第一第二五年計劃。根本上與中山先生之建國方略。殊多近似之處。彼能於四年之間。經濟上飛躍突進。我國與蘇聯主義。雖取道各異。而彼之努力於工業的建設。實足爲事國「他山之石。」吾國民之應努力於經濟的開發與建設。萬不可再事延緩。對日問題尤須以國民之經濟力爲競爭的基礎。至於排貨運動。在表面上似爲一種積極行動。而實質上仍屬消極工作。蓋僅止抵貨。不過使對方感覺苦痛。而自身尙無所建樹也。故我國之國民總動員。不必全在乎軍事的勝利。外交的折衝。而最後總清算。須視吾國人在經濟建設之努力何如以爲推斷。</p>

<p>▲路透二十二日倫敦電英國會今日復開、英皇偕后同蒞國會致詞、言及世界問題國家財政及一般經濟情形、尤希望世界經濟會議之成功、並望軍縮之有良好結果、繼謂關於印度憲法之提議、一俟圓桌、會議結束時、政府即將提交國會議决之又謂政府不久將提出關於失業保險及其他失業問題之辦法云云、此次國會開會、原擬注重内務、但亦將兼及外交、開會、之初美國戰債問題最爲重要、一星期前、衆料美國必接受英國所提出展緩付欵之建議、茲據美逐日傳來之消息此種希望恐不可恃、英國預算案並未列有償付戰債之欵、如美國必須還債則、不得不提出追加預算案、而募債英金二千八百萬鎊以應付之、</p>
<h3>組委會開會</h3>
<p>▲路透二十二日日内瓦電世界經濟會議之組織委員會今日集議、由英外相西門主席、决定明年一月間重行召集專家籌備開會、並决定明年五月間舉行世界經濟大會、美代表台維斯爲組織委員之一、今日曾發中國乃世界中最大用銀國之說、故中國將因此言而可加入籌備委員會、惟中國應否參加初步討論、將由籌備委員會自己决定之、查籌備委員會近曾加入挪威代表一人、</p>
<h3>會商戰債問題</h3>
<p>▲路透二十一日華盛頓電胡佛總統旣謀將明年政府預算案削減美金逾五萬萬元現注重與羅斯福會商戰債事已約明日會晤閣員已應總統之請將預算修正白宮所定削減之數約美金七萬萬元、但因公債付息還本及付還稅項等之增加、須由此數中除去一萬五千萬元</p>
<p>▲路透二十一日紐約電衆慮戰債停付期限無展長之可能性、故今日英鎊之價落至本年之最低度、現因國會多主反對、故衆信羅斯福如不竭力主張展長戰債停付期限、則胡佛總統未必提議展長、至羅氏似决不致主張展長云</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯二十二日倫敦電「晨報」載華盛頓消息、胡佛總統與羅斯福新總統之談話、不僅係討論戰債問題且更涉及世界經濟會議及遠東問題、現信會見後所發表之公報、將不發表談話之結論、</p>
<h3>希特勒組閣希望依然渺茫</h3>
<p>▲路透二十一日柏林電希特勒組閣希望、仍極渺茫、希氏與其心腹及前德意志銀行總裁沙赫特博士今日自正午至晚、草擬答覆興堡總統所提出任其爲總理之條件其條件如下、㈠新内閣人員必須由總統認可、㈡總統保留任施萊轍將軍爲國防部長、牛賴資爲外交部長之權、㈢總統要求新政府之經濟計畫、須由其認可、㈣新政府應擔保不恢復德意志與普魯士邦間之「二元主義」、㈤新内閣不得企圖削減憲法第四十條所授予總統之權力、希特勒現正竭力草擬能使總統滿意之覆函、而政治界皆覺希氏依此條件組閣之希望甚微、縱完全接受總統之條件、亦不能在國會中獲大多數之贊助、蓋中央黨殊無熱切贊助之意、而胡根堡之國權黨則甚反對之也、胡根堡迄今尙未與希特勒開談話、但已拒絕會晤國社黨國會權長戈林氏、如希特勒失敗、則興登堡總統大約將請中央黨領袖加斯氏力圖獲國會之多數但國社黨如加反對、則加斯氏亦須失敗、至是總統唯有以中立之領袖組織總統内閣、而保留現政府之多數閣員之一途、</p>

<h3>中國營業公司</h3>
<p>按經濟學之原理。凡投資者對於所有儲蓄信託資産。非但需有充分之利益。且須握有最可靠之保障。本公司爲上海創設最早之地産交易市塲。迄今已有二十餘年之歷史。已收足之資本達五百萬兩。去年營業大概。祗以地産及抵押部言之。亦在四千五百六十三萬二千三百兩以上。尙有地産管理，經租房屋，保險信託以及其他收八不計。</p>
<p>本公司係介紹地産交易者而非地産投機者。茲將去年之營業對照表列</p>
<p>后，</p>
<p>資産一千二百三十四萬一千七百二十兩三錢一分。</p>
<p>房地産實價三百三十五萬一千○五十五兩八錢四分。</p>
<p>現欵一百八十四萬四千二百五十九兩一錢一分過去二十年中。本公司所經營之押欵已逾一萬萬兩。本利無不還清。房地産押欵（房地産由本公司保管）五百九十七萬一千二百兩。已發債票四百八十四萬○七百兩。至於債票之收入及本公司資本中之一百十三萬一千五百兩全充抵押事業之用。茲將今年二月二十九日舉行之一九三一年股東會議時主席報吿之摘要列左，</p>
<p>以投資言之。持有本公司之債券者與持有本公司之股單者。同爲本公司之股東。自當享受應得利益。依據二年來撥付息金之數目。吾知持有債券者所獲之利息爲八厘而非六厘。實爲正當也。綜觀今後之趨勢。凡爲最勝利之商號。必依照有益共享之宗旨而行。恐不出數年後。即辦理銀行事業者。亦將於應付存户流動之利率外。由所收存户之欵獲得盈餘之中。提撥一部份分給存户。所有本公司在債劵項下收得之欵。以本公司非投機公司。故並無分文撥爲購置地産之用。所得之欵。盡爲頭等地産押欵之用。此項債劵。不但有各該抵押品價値之担保。且使債劵有二重之担保。即持有本公司之債劵人有優先享受本公司全部資産之權利是也。凡此皆於本公司收付總單上明白註明。如蒙加以考核。即知每一債劵。備有該債劵三倍價値之資産以爲債劵到期付債之担保。</p>

<h3>退出國聯與南洋委任統治地之前途（續）</h3>
<p>（日本東京帝大敎授神川彦松）</p>
<p>▲國聯之有權解釋從來國聯所采用之見解、且可作爲國聯規約之解釋而最妥當者、當爲下列之學說、即認委任統治有二重權限也、受委任國之决定、與其變更、均屬於主要同盟及聯合國、然委任統治地之行政、則當以國聯之名義行之、並須服從國聯之監督、換言之、則委任統治地者、屬於主要同盟及聯合國與國際聯盟共同統治之下者也、此說爲國聯理事會一九二○年八月五日所采用伊曼士報吿之見解、即以之爲從來國際所采用之有權解釋、當無差誤、</p>
<p>▲國聯所取之態度如何以上國際法方面之考察、業經終了茲當移於觀測國際政治方面、關於委任統治權之授與及剝奪、其學說之多歧、旣如前文所述、然則日本以滿洲事件之故、與國聯發生正面衝突、以致退出國聯時、國聯果將采取何種學說乎、（？）此當綜觀國際政治上之實勢、與聯盟諸國對於日本之反感、及其他諸般狀况、方能决定、必不許貿然預斷、但竊料國聯最易采用之學說、當爲國聯取作有權解釋而曾被采用之最後一說、國聯如果采用此說、屆時受委任國之日本、所居之地位如何、（？）是固不難推定、何也、因依照此說、則凡委任統治地、應屬於主要同盟及聯合國與國聯共同管領之下、苟我國始終反對、國聯即不能剝奪我南洋羣島之委任統治權、不待言也、</p>
<p>▲因日本已非聯盟國、當現出由國聯委任而行委任統治之變相事態、關於此點、於委任統治之實行上、非準備遇着種種困難不可、依國聯規約第二十二條第七項及第九項、受委任國應向國聯提出委任統治地之年報、由常設委任統治委員會、予以審查、以非聯盟國而欲出席於常設委任統治委員會及理事會陳述意見、當不免有許多困難情形、是又我所應予注意者也、</p>
<p>▲最惡之場合則何如然國際政治之情形、乃因時勢爲轉移、最惡之塲合亦不可不豫爲設想、國聯旣視日本爲敵國、法律上之解釋、并采用前述之積極說、即不得不有剝奪日本所得委任統治權之事實、情勢至此、南洋羣島委任統治地之運命、果何如乎？、國聯决定剝奪日本之委任統治權、將以之授與何國乎？余謂有授與之可能性者、計有二國、第一德國、第二美國、</p>
<p>德意志於一九二○年第一次國聯大會開會時、曾送一備忘錄於大會、謂當决定分配舊德領委任統治地時、德意志亦有被考慮之權利、若於委任統漒名義之下、而以此等地域完全合併於主要同盟及聯合國、殊有侵犯規約第二十二條之嫌、迨一九二六年、德意志加入國聯、獲得常任理事國之地位、德意志更提出有力之主張、謂德意志爲文化高等之先進國、於擔負資源經騐等委任統治各責任、具有最適當之資格、德意志旣爲委任統治地舊領主、現又爲國聯常任理事國、當然有參加委任統治分我杯羹之權利、又在聯盟諸國中、爲欲使德意志忘去戰敗之苦惱、安心加入國聯起見亦有主張必須與以委任統治權者、綜合從前過情形、一旦國聯剝奪日本委任統治權、恐將轉而授與德意志、固非漫無根據之談也、雖然、委任統治地、本係德意志割讓於主要同盟及聯合國、則由日本剝奪此項權利時、仍舊授與主要同盟及聯合國中之美國、不得謂爲無人作此主張者、由從來之國際政治事情以觀此、種可能性、固似較德意志稍小、然更放眼一觀太平洋上日美對立關係、則美國之獲得南洋羣島委任統治權、固不能斷爲毫無希望也、</p>
<p>國聯將剝奪我國之南洋羣島委任統治權、轉而授與德國或美國、是爲最惡之情勢、當此之際、我國果能服從國聯之决定乎（？）、吾有以知其必不能也、我國如蔑視國聯此項决定依然統治南洋羣島、將馴致如何之結果乎（？）、此時國聯勢非訴諸海軍、驅逐日本勢力於南洋羣島以外不可、</p>
<p>然謂國聯或新受委任國之德或美、肯賭海戰以爭南洋羣島之管領權乎、吾敢斷爲萬無此事、結局不過在國聯會議記錄上、一書南洋羣島爲德國或美國之委任統治地、實際則依然歸我占領、仍在我統治之下而已、當此之時國聯必目日本爲不法占領國、且視爲國聯之公敵、而加以非難、前途必將不堪設想、此又不可不豫爲之所也、（完）</p>
<p>要聞</p>
<h3>大美晚報痛駁日本意見書</h3>
<p>日本乃强以舊式爲最新花樣</p>
<p>九國條約對中國未限以時間</p>
<p>不得他人允許不能治理他人</p>
<p>林肯名言必行於滿洲及世界</p>
<p>日本意見書强詞奪理、荒謬絕倫、各報已有論評駁斥、外交部亦正在草擬駁文、但言　自我、人或謂爲有主觀見解、二十日大美晚報發表一論、斥日本爲作十九世紀裝束以示人、而謂爲最時髦之新花樣、又斷定日本終將不得不改其心志、立議嚴正、茲譯原文如左、</p>
<p>外論社譯二十一口大美晚報評論、云日本對調查團之意見書似無甚新事實卽有之、亦屬微乎其微反、之却有一大堆重複之辯論、特别顯見爲日本不能了悟國際事件現代思想逾徑之新啟示、嘗有人一再發表言論謂日本爲一運道不佳之國家、永久落伍而不能追上、日本之奢望係産生於舊意義下之帝國日益變爲過時之際、日本之努力辯證其帝國主義行動爲合理、常根據於已由條約及新國際態度使其歸於無效之先例、準是、日本不斷戮力於幹多年前已幹過之事、且對其行動所引起本現代概念而加以之批評非笑及眞正敵意、輒表憤怒、日本永遠腰束撑裙使高之軟墊、前高後低之女帽、展示一八五六年之婦女新裝、以證明其所服者爲最新裝束、日本之批評、有數點使人驚疑、預備日本覆文之人、事實上是否曾　將報吿愼加閲視例如其中有一語謂報吿書對日本之不平係枝零破碎而論之、且不能承認一根本要旨、而使其平整歸爲一體、丨卽謂「有一定之立意、欲消滅日本在滿洲之權利、」就事實立言、報吿書澈底承認所提之事、不過係以叧一種詞句出之、丨「行其、中國）限制日本在滿洲常利益之國策、」此乃李頓與日本對滿洲見解相異之中心點、調查團看出「中日兩國國家政策目的彼此衝突、」「看出爲享有非常利益」者而不爲享有「權利」者、而日本之答辯、則基於天授日本使之崇高根據、以將一無主之境、名義上爲一全不堪稱爲「國家」之鄰國所有者、、撥亂而反治</p>
<p>概觀上文所有根本不同之處、則每重要之點自必有三翻四覆頭重脚輕之衝突、對日人開端即有之假定、即謂調查團簡直不知所談何事者停止加以考慮、而進入一較堅固之根據、即認調查團固自知之、不過係從叧一與日本完全不同之觀點發言、此點卽立可解决矣、日本之批評、旣復回至華府會議、甚至可不必與調查團持同樣見解、日本對中國現似採取一大異於其他簽字各國之觀點矣、</p>
<p>日本據謂感覺一切事件、已使一九二二年假定受紿、竟傳達中國迅速進步、應爲該約繼續有效之先决條件之義實際上人人皆可查閲該約以見文中并無此種意義、該約命簽字各國「尊重中國主權獨立及領土行政完整、」要求各國「予中國以一最充份最不受困難之機會以、發展并維持一有效而穩固之政府、」對中國發展之進程、并未加以時間之限制、中國國家發展之進程、若有興衰起伏、亦如個人所有者然、在此無偏見之旁觀者看來、似屬頗爲自然之事、而日本現竟以滿洲事物不合於彼之根據、從事造出證明其在滿洲之整個進程爲合理之理由、</p>
<p>如前所云、此項答辯與李頓報吿之間有無數點皆有頭重脚輕之衝突、日本不但繼續堅持「滿洲國」之産生、係自然而獨立之事、且進一步宣稱、「滿洲國之前途、日本認爲燦爛光明、」試以此而與李頓之見解相較、李頓云「獨立運動、一九三　年九月以前、在滿洲曾無所聞、僅因日軍之在塲行動實爲明顯之事、」又所引中國銀行家商人語李頓之言、「吾等不欲變爲朝鮮人、」</p>
<p>此等無路可通之點、祇須記得其爲何等偶然對於日本官塲與調查團根本概念之相異何等直接有阻礙卽無容再加多述矣、林肯於多年前嘗言、「余確謂不得對方之允許、無人能夠治理他人者、」此種見解、當使世界頗費時日以看出其價値、日本卽爲證明依然有人尙未信之明證、但此究一有正理、而文明之見解、終必行之於滿洲、且必將行之於世界各處、凡承認此事實者將得免於後來改變心志、或不得不使其心志改變其自身也、</p>

<h3>昨晚西靑籃球賽夏光二分慘敗</h3>
<p>▲最後一分鐘敗於麥令</p>
<p>▲結果三十三比三十一</p>
<p>約翰勝南星</p>
<p>今晚無比賽</p>
<p>昨晚西靑籃球賽夏光於最後一分鐘以二分之差慘敗於麥令、結果三十三比三十一、空氣之緊張、爲開賽以來所未有尙有一組、則約翰以三十七比三十二勝南星趣味較遜、今晚爲女子籃球賽、男子休息一日、</p>
<p>▲夏光敗得可惜</p>
<p>▲夏光聲勢上場夏光接連中的聲勢煊赫一時四比二、八比二、陳寳球之罰中一分、遂以九比二居極優之形勢大有横掃麥令之氣慨、然轉瞬以防範稍疏麥令乘隙反攻、連爲襲進、麥令得十一分之多、以十三比九超出、嗣以十五比十一、麥令勝上半時、</p>
<p>▲風濤疊出夏光以優勢而爲麥令追出攻守較前嚴密於是比賽亦隨之接近而緊張、任魏二鋒之努力、卒以十六比十五追出、繼成十八比十七、超前一分然麥令十九比十八、二十一比二十、又反勝一分風浪變化無窮、令人捉摸不定趣味亦隨之倍增、</p>
<p>▲臨了精彩夏光僅以一分落後、轉瞬蒙納漢連中、麥令又以二十七比二十二超出五分、精彩於此以起、關檔安之遠射任傑星之成功夏光此時才顯美妙之合作以二十七比二十七再度打成平手、時將終局空氣突現緊張、</p>
<p>▲最後慘敗二十七比二十七後、麥令復以二十九比二十七、三十一比二十九、皆僅以二分佔先、陳寳球突中一球、三十一比三十一再成平手、然最後之數十秒鐘中、别雪潑之一球、夏光遂吿慘敗、</p>
<p>▲挫折原因夏光機會昨晚多於麥令、而麥令之射籃、不準確而失的者不少、夏光大有得勝機會然其致命之傷乃在上半時九比二佔勝後、呆滯不進、守衛疏鬆、動作緩慢遂爲麥令超出而連得十餘分下半時雖努力、已吿不及、陳寳球之减色亦爲不能得勝之一因</p>

<p>二一枝譚</p>
<h3>秃髮的我</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>頭髮有沙髮棉髮的不同，沙髮近硬化，而棉髮則近軟化：在年靑時代，沙髮和棉髮，沒有甚麽顯着的異點。待到過了中年，沙髮易白而不易秃，棉髮易秃而不易白；這是上天的妙用，「牽精帶肥」，「一隻鰟搭一隻蝦」，好敎兩不相虧，各有各的優點，也是各有各的劣點。我是屬於棉髮者，才到中年，前線的頭髮陣，已不能維持原狀，有些陣線動搖；現在呢，不必說了，一道道的防線向後退，已退到第三道防綫了丨但是，陣綫雖然退縮，却沒有掛着白旗，這是棉髮的特微，値得自豪的。</p>
<p>自摸頭顱，雖不曾全秃，但是，秀才的秀字，尾巴彎轉來，究脱不了一個秃字；在秃言秃，且講兩個秃子來頑頑：</p>
<p>春秋時代的魯大夫季了孫，是個秃子；他和跛足的晋大夫郤克，僂背的曹公子首，眇目的衛卿孫良夫，同聘於齊；齊侯也揀着秃者，跛者，僂者，眇者，分任他們的駕車人，以致來賓大怒，釀成一塲惡戰。我以爲跛僂眇三者是殘疾，晋曹衛三使者發怒，尙在人情之中。秃子是老年人必經的階級，魯季孫這一怒，眞怒的沒交代了。</p>
<p>要是外國秃子，恨不得有其他的秃子，來做他的良伴，最近舉行的秃髮會，早已傳爲佳話。且置不論；從前保加利亞有一位公爵，爲着病後髮脫，早秃其頂，當時便有貴族五百餘人，個個把頭髮薙去，露出頂上圓光，來做公爵的秃髮同志；公爵便歡然和他們往來，自喜爲秃髮不孤。這位公爵的器量，和魯國的季孫不同，季孫見了一個秃髮御者，尙且動怒，要是有這五百名秃子包圍他，只怕他的秃頂上面，要冒出火燄來了！呵呵！</p>
<h3>美國人眼中的中國</h3>
<p>— 徐柏庵</p>
<p>丨中國並不比美國更壞丨</p>
<p>在之江大學担任敎授的美人穆根先生，我曾經聽見他講過這樣的話。你們總不要以爲是中國已經壞到無可收拾的地步，而憧憬着我們美國的國家社會是優良的，完美的。這一種偏見大概是受了胡適博士宣傳的影響。依据我的觀察，我覺得中國並不比美國更壞丨譬如，中國人私販鴉片是很盛的，但美國人的私運酒精却也可以媲美：譬如，上海的綁票案子很多，有時候一天多至五六件，但美國繁華的都市如紐約，如芝加哥，多的時候多到一晚上發生七十幾件咧，而上學期，不是飛行家林白的愛子也給綁去嗎？實際上，犯罪的增加和文明的進展是在用同一的速率向前飛奔，美國的物質文明比中國高，所以罪惡的程度也比中國高，那是毫無疑義的所異者，美國的資本家和他們豢養的政治家手腕好，組織好，能夠把許多醜惡的事情遮蓋在社會的最下層，而在上層塗上一層耀眼的黃金，于是，淺識的人們便頌讚着黃金了，而忘了它下層的罪惡。反觀中國，情形便不同了；上層是醜惡的，但下層也不過那樣醜惡，誠然</p>
<h3>大菜和大餅</h3>
<p>— 晚成</p>
<p>吃大菜是代表貴族階級，吃大餅是代表窮苦階級，何故「大菜」「大餅」都帮「大」？實含有哲學意味啦。</p>
<p>我們的理論，以爲吃大菜比吃大餅，當然是吃大菜幸福囉！</p>
<p>其實；我們試看黃包車夫牛馬般的奔走後，當飢腸轆轆，肚子萬分需要的時候，手持大餅嚼食。他神經上似乎感着萬分的愉快，肚子裏十萬火急的需要。他雖然是吃大餅，其味無窮！勝於貴族們吃大菜的滋味！</p>
<p>反想貴族們所吃山珍海味。大菜酒席。日以爲常。但是他們恐還及不上窮人們吃大餅的有味吧。</p>
<p>所以「大餅」也稱一個「大」字。其物雖賤，窮人得之亦復「大」快朶頤。一切世事，應作如是觀。</p>
<p>個銅元買糖吃的孩提時代，便沾染着賭，受賭的訓練。娛樂遊戲，無論種種，多少都包含賭的性質，抑且和賭分不開。</p>
<p>至若以金錢賭，以老婆賭，以性命賭，那是單純的角勝負，是鬥爭的你死我活主義。「人生原來就是一塲賭博。」中國人有這樣的熱剌剌的「鬥爭的」人生觀，那倒是了不起的。</p>
<p>人生是應該發財的。而發財是，七分靠運命，三分靠努力。中國人最信宿命論，於賭博中可見之，但賭這東西本身祗是瞎碰，偶然的機遇，所以他們的哲學祗是整個的胡里胡塗的適然史觀。賭最好是贏，否則輸一點也好。他們懂得「不輸不贏」是無聊的，不好不歹，這算什麽？運命怎樣解釋呢</p>
<p>所以賭需要一點豪爽。但賭更需要多量的貪婪與僥倖心。中國人是易於利誘的。它又需要小巧的機智，狡猾，欺詐等等，還有，它需要冒險性。我們知道，廣東人和其他「南蠻」的「賭風」是著名的，他們伶俐爽快，有冒險天才。單是酒菜館的招牌也寫了「中發白」「清一色」「大三元」等類名詞，你可以猜想他們的麻雀技術定是頂瓜瓜的。試想所謂「孤注一擲」那時，是何等胆略何等氣慨丨　膩畏怯而不甚豪爽的江南人曾有幾個呢。</p>
<h3>死之岔道㈡㈩㈡</h3>
<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>「唉這那裏可以，他們老輩裏的人，都不願意當兵的，你向他們說，包管不答應的，還是你自己打定主見。：：：我是好意，因爲聽你說，日子難過，一輩子守不出頭，就是出門去走走，看看靑山綠水，多幾個朋友，多長些見識，也未嘗不好。：：：去不去隨便，我不便過分的撮掇你，將來要怪怨我的」</p>
<p>「你的幾天躭擱」？</p>
<p>姜牛皮扳着指頭，仰着頭說：今天二十一，不算，二十二到蘇州去，看朋友，二十三還來，二十四到東山去，把幾畝荒田託了人，二十五或者要躭擱在那裏，二十六來，二十七就要動身，月底還來得及到九江去關餉。</p>
<p>「有五個囫圇的日子，足夠我的盤算了。」</p>
<p>姜牛皮把將要燒焦竹煙咀的一點香煙屁股，摘了下來，向煙咀裏吹了一吹，放在袋裏，</p>
<p>了一杯茶一口喝乾，立起來說；</p>
<p>「你想定了，再回覆我罷」</p>
<p>阿根也立起來，無誠意的撩一句：「到我家裏喫了飯走。」</p>
<p>「不客氣我有親戚約着，再會！」無意中把右手向右太陽穴一伸，行了一個不完全的軍禮。</p>
<p>阿根也暗暗好笑。</p>
<p>到了二十六的晚上，阿根的煩躁，無可形容了。劉大坐在南瓜棚下一塊石條上吸旱烟。劉婆子坐在一塊木梢做成的坐具上剝向日癸。夕陽從半黃的南瓜菜裏射過來，射在二老的臉上，更顯得黃橙橙地，像「成份處」櫃台邊亂放着兩尊已經灰暗的，剝落的土地公公，和土地娘娘的塑像。只有阿根一回兒面上的血充滿了，精神激發了，像西洋離刻的斯巴達武士。一回兒頽喪了，低下了頭，用脚踢着泥場上細磚塊，恨不得把世界上足以障礙人生進程的東西，也一概踢去。嘴裏要說，有一個主宰者不許，凡是不許說的話，橫梗在咽喉口，比咽喉上生「加答兒」都難受。忽然劉婆子衝破了寂寞的晚照說；</p>
<p>「這個南瓜長得眞大，足有十斤，我們明天夜飯不用燒了，喫南瓜罷。」</p>
<p>阿根聽了，又起了根觸，倘然明天隨着姜走這挺大南瓜，就喫不着了。還有一層，這一走，不知道幾時還來，不要也像前幾年愛姑走的時候，我問伊。「幾時還來？」伊沒有還答，便走了，到底當眞不還來了。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　言吳稚暉先生的妙语  佛　　吳稚暉先生，好說風凉話，非常有趣，非常滑稽而有意義，我久矣沒有聽到吳先生的妙論，昨天又在報紙上看到先生的妙語，不能不爲之記錄一下，吳先生說，　　行政院譬如土地堂，有土地堂，老　　百姓還是吃飯睡覺，沒有土地堂，老百姓也是吃飯睡覺，故無焦急必要，　　吳先生的話，一些也不差，但是吳先生的話，言簡意賅，我且將這幾句話，引伸一下，補充一下，把旣畫的蛇還添上幾只脚吳先生謂行政院譬如土地堂，我想别種機關也未必不如此若行政院比方土地堂其餘的各種機關不是城隍廟觀音堂普照寺等等麽我國原是多神之國以各地的機關支配各地的廟宇大約可以相當　　其實土地堂不若換做五聖廟的允當中央有五院我國有五聖廟數目相同不過吳先生說，有土地堂老百姓還是吃飯睡覺，沒有土地堂，老百姓也是吃飯睡覺，在這裏我到有一些意義要補充沒有土地堂老百姓可以吃飯睡覺有了土地堂老百姓反而不能吃飯睡覺因爲有了土地堂老百姓必定要去燒香還願假定不去燒香還願土地菩薩便要作怪故土地堂觀音殿等越多老百姓燒香還願越忙所以弄得飯也沒有工夫吃覺也沒有工夫睡　　並且廟宇愈多，則廟裏的和尙天然也愈多，這種和尙無非罩了老爺牌頭吃飯所謂「吃老爺，着老爺，灶裏無柴燒老爺，」和尙有了飯吃便奉承老爺沒有飯吃一方面便要拆老爺的臺一方面拼命要老百姓募化齋飯假定香烟興盛的廟宇幾個和尙走出來那一個不是吃得雪白滾壯身上穿的齊齊整整就是幾個香伙徒弟還要比我們氣慨得多理　　語曰「東家不念經，西家解星辰，」現在的和尙眞是不怕沒飯吃所苦的祗有幾個老百姓燒香還願念經忙夠不了文藝感歎詞  仲　　禍變倉皇似潰疽，堂堂專閫竟何如，城關一任鯨波沒，樓閣全憑𪣝氣嘘，北地奴才工拜跪，東山太傅慣躊躇，傷心唇輔供饕餐，又向中原問有餘，　　河山東北正烟　，忽地狂瀾歇浦濱，祇有神鷹堪奮擊，誰言海　可柔馴，元戎任重紆籌策，壯士生輕易怒嗔，屈辱似聞全大計，江灣秋草亂靑　（却酬）科學砒  盛展能　　砒霜，我們知道它是一種劇毒的東西，食其少量，（○·○六至○·一八克。）即足致命，所以有利用其毒性，以殺有害的動物。　　砒霜又名信石或白砒，在化學上，用分析的方法，可以檢知它是一種砒元素的三氧化物，分子式是Ａs2O3，其所以有劇毒的原因，恐怕是因爲與人體中的水份相化合而成能溶解的亞砒酸的緣故，所以如有人誤服砒霜，可服以新製之沉澱三氫氧化鐵或氫氧化鎂以解之。因此等物質與亞砒酸作用，能生成一種不可溶性的重金屬亞砒酸鹽，不爲人體血液所吸收，因而不致中毒。　　㈠産地砒（或名砷。）有自然産出之原素，亦有有與多種金屬化合而産出，其主要者爲硫砒鐵礦，即毒ＦeAsS雄黃Ａs2S3，雞冠石Ａs2S3，及其氧化物等。　　砒之産量，世界上以德國爲最多，美國及英國次之。一九一一年，德國所産之氧化砒與硫化砒二者爲二九八一噸。　　㈡性質其遊離之元素，呈鋼灰色，有金屬之光澤，分結晶與不結晶之二種，結晶者，當平常温度時，於乾空氣中不起變化，在濕空氣中則否，燃燒時，則生雲霧狀之固體三氧化二砒Ａs２Ｏ３，與造鹽元素，硫，及多種金屬能直接化合，當與硝酸，氯水及其他强氧化劑如氯酸鉀等共沸時，砒即氧化而生成砒酸Ｈ３ＡsＯ４。㈢檢騐　　甲，取試料一小塊，置木炭上，以吹管於火燄中燒之，即生成雲霧狀之白烟，並有極不快之蒜臭，證明有砒存在。　　乙，取細粉試料，加約三倍量之乾燥碳酸鈉及𩇛化鉀，混合後，置於玻璃之閉管内，徐徐熱之。先將上部所凝集之水點，用布拭去，强熱之，則管之冷部即生成砒之有光鏡面。　　丙，馬希氏之騐砒法，此法爲辨識任何種可溶性化合狀態中砒之存在與否之一種極精密之試騐，法將供試品置於燒瓶中，加以適量之鋅粒，然後加以稀鹽酸則砒即與新生氫相化合而生成氣體之砒化三氫：　　ＡsＣ３+３Ｈ２－２ＡsＨ３－+３ＨＣe砒化三氫燃燒時，呈藍色火燄，生成水及三氧化二砒之霧曇；　　2AsH3+3O2－３Ｈ２Ｏ+As2O3　　砒化三氫於加熱時，先解離爲氫及砒之　離元素，故於氫燄之内部有砒之蒸　存在，如以白色瓷器之冷部接觸其火燄，則砒即凝結爲金屬砒之褐斑點，雖僅加微量之砒之供試品於發生瓶中，然其所生之斑點亦甚顯著。　　㈣定量三價砒化合物以氫化劑處理之，則變爲五價化合物，利用此項化學反應，可以規定之𥑞試液滴定其含量之多寡，又利用砒酸與銀鹽化合於中性溶液中變爲砒酸銀而沉澱，先定此沉澱搗乱份子  宗城</p>

<p>電影專刊國際要聞蘇聯電影之輸入輸出  凌鶴　　關於蘇聯電影與外國電影的關係，當然有其特異之點，因爲其政　　　　治的特殊性，對於這種關係乃是非常限制的。　　蘇聯與别國的通商，其最發達的莫過德意志。爲了若干電影之製作，當與柏林的大公司互相計劃。　　蘇聯之電影貿易，與五十九國發生關係，但有些國家，却到現在還不曾接着一本蘇聯之影片。或因檢查之關係，某些國家也只能開映少數的影片。同時另一方面，因爲蘇聯的財政政策，儘可能的防止通貨之流出，也很少輸入外國影片。近年來之電影輸入，特别是對於美法，在片子的選擇上，常加以種種的非難，這在一社會主義的國家中或爲必然之現象。蘇聯在其意識形態上，在其預算上，其對於國産電影之興行，比較國外電影，一定不能使其超過本國電影的比率，因其努力之結果，至一九二八年，將一九二五年的百分之八十七的外國影片之輸入減少至百分之三十六。至去年直减爲百分之二十五。　　現在蘇聯電影之眞價，已爲世界人士所深悉，誰都承認蘇聯的電影是新的，生動的，有力的，具有特殊的敎育意義，事實上已爲廣大的觀衆所歡迎，這當然是蘇聯電影輸出發達之好的條件，同時即就政治的見地看來，在各資本主義的國家中，因爲商業競爭的緣故，對於蘇聯電影之存在，也是决然不能完全忽視的了。舞蹈家蓓絲蓓麗來滬今日明日在蘭心表演蓓絲蓓麗是美利堅最有名的女舞蹈家。她的足跡走遍了天下；她的妙舞名聞了全球。在東方最繁盛的上海埠表演，還是破題兒第一遭。將於今日明日假座邁而西愛路蒲石路口蘭心大戲院表演兩天云。　　國内消息華北各埠影刋勃興  英　　華北一帶，地接京畿，文化甚盛，民十前後，即有電影刋物産生。其中最著者，莫若費穆君（現任聯華第一廠導演）主編之華北畫報。斯時平津大報如大公，益世，新晨，華北，京報，導報，無不有電影週刋之刋行。乃時過境遷，舊日京華，日就荒蕪，京報之影光週刋，不啻碩果僅存矣，　　晚近二年，津沾生氣勃勃，不可向邇。客春有銀彈及電影三日刋之出版。近月海上風起雲湧，橫波所被，津埠首起響應；除商報每日出版外，庸報，大公已在籌備之中。華北極著名之兩畫報丨北洋及中華丨亦有電影週刋之籌備，　　北洋爲華北各畫報中之創辦最早者。近雖略帶政治意味，而仍具藝術之蒂，聞已訂十二月中旬每星期四出版電影週刋，　　中華爲後起之秀，與北洋並覇藝壇。且有平民化之圖畫日刋出版該日刋亦曾有電影週刋之設，但未久即停，今該電影週刋，改附於畫報，每星期五出版一次。並在上海設立代理處，各報販均出售云。綁匪光臨？  振華　　瑪蓮（ＭarleＤierich）在一月以前，這時她正遷居在一個清靜的海濱，忽然她接到了一恐嚇信，說要綁她的愛女曼利（Ｍaria）因此她在幾天中，她心焦的了不得。她盡了畢生之力，去保護她。並且還雇了個保鏢一步也不離開她，這時假使在她門外放個砲竹，也便會使她嚇的魂飛天外，因爲她或疑着綁匪光臨了。意見陳述兒童電影院的需要  雲　　誰都知道成人有成人的心理，兒童有兒童的心理，所以成人們所歡喜的東西，未必是兒童們所歡喜的。看電影，當然也是這樣的。我有時到影戲院去，時常聽到兒童的哭聲，看到兒童的睡覺，這就表示他們不喜歡這張影片。所以要想替兒童們謀幸福，非另建兒童電影院不可。　　美國施立旦氏對於兒童影戲院，夢想了九年之久，竟於一九三○年十一月二十四日實現於美國裘司城中。該影戲院的位置在裘司城阿勳街二二三號，此街雖爲全城之中心點，而很少馳行汽車及電車，以避免兒童們行走馬路之危險。該影戲院無論在院外院内處處是爲兒童們打算，院内其有一千四百三十五個位置，飾以西班牙式的花紋。爲避免兒童們的上樓的危險，所以沒有樓，沒有階。關於影片方面，也很鄭重地選擇，凡有屬於迷信及不合兒童們的影片，均在屏斥之列。　　關於這種電影院，希望我國的電影界，早日實現，實造福於兒童當不淺也。本埠消息費穆與阮玲玉？  燕南　　日前本埠，盛傳聯華公司導演費穆與演員阮玲玉，有發生衝突之說。予以「城市之夜」，爲聯華之巨構，今該片尙未吿成，而導演與明星之間，已發生誤會，不唯該片前功堪虞，亦聯華之大不幸也。特趨車該廠以探眞相焉，　　迨入聯華，則使予大異，蓋費與阮適在用茶，談笑一若往昔。予乃直言質之，始知外間所方傳聞之誤也。　　蓋費君導演時，阮女士正扮死人，費令試演再四。阮女士作嬌嗔曰「那天呌我淋了一夜雨，今天還讓我死好幾回嗎？費君亦報以笑語曰「多死幾回怕什麽？反正是假的。」此種謔笑，攝影場中固不算希奇，不意外間，竟無中生有也費君於攝完「城市之夜」後，尙當北返一次，此亦私事，蓋費君家屬，仍居津沾，費君不能免俗故擬返津度臘也。至聯華北平五廠由費君主持一說，公司中亦有此擬議，唯羅明佑尙未加以表示，明星韻事嘉寳和瓊克勞福的個性  吻濤　　葛來泰嘉寳是神秘的。瓊克勞福是摩登的。她們倆同是個好萊塢的交際花同是能誘惑着許多的人們的。然而她們嗜好。却各不相似。瓊的臉。從來不喜歡搽粉的。她每天僅僅修飾她的眼睛。眉毛。及嘴唇罷了。可是嘉寳却不然。她許多粉都要試試的。最後她還是把很厚而光亮的粉。塗在臉上。使人們不能瞧出她的眞面目來。　　她們的性情。也大不同的。瓊不喜歡聽快樂歌調。而愛聽悲哀的曲子。嘉寳是有時愛聽音樂。有時又不愛。她偶逢到興奮的時候。甚而至于親上無線電播音台前。去演唱一番。　　嘉寳所穿的衣服。都不希望怎樣考究的。但是瓊無論什麽時候。都歡喜穿的奇形怪狀的。　　嘉寳是愛靜的。所以很不願和人說話。或上什麽宴會。而瓊就不是這樣的。不過人家不去同他講話或請她上宴會。她倒也不在意的。隨便談談一個有趣的問題  怡怡館主　　丨關乎『明星』的稱謂丨們誰都知道，說起『明星』的稱謂，就是著名的電影演員。惟著名的演員，纔有稱『明星』的資格。可是，我國的電影演員，只要能上得鏡頭，拍一兩齣戲，就可稱一聲『明星』。『明星』！『明星』！我在這『明星』的聲浪中，覺得有一個有趣的問題，値得寫出來談談。這個有趣的問題是什麽？便是關乎『明星』的稱謂。　　我以爲晴天的夜裏，天空中固然有點點燦爛的明星，隱約閃鑠，點綴得美大，但是，還有一輪皎潔的明月，照澈許地，也何等的幽美丨自古來，顚倒幾麗騷人墨客，月下吟詩，莫不欣賞。就是現代的摩登人物，靑年情侶，也莫不歡迎這一輪明月，正好作爲情話談心的良夜。於此可見月之受人歡迎，實爲星所不及，不但如此，而且以體積和光綫而論，星都萬萬及不上月亮。那麽，中外人士，對於一般從事電影而著名的演員，何不稱之曰『明星』？却稱之曰『明星』。是什麽道理，這不可說不是電影界中一個有趣的問題吧？電影談屑　　電影作風，各國不同：美國偉大；德國　摯；英國老練；法國浮華；日本淺薄；莫不可以表示其國民性也。若言國産電影，初則「新劇化」如開心影片公司「神仙棍」之類。繼則神話化」如明星公司普年所編「紅蓮寺」之顃。一二八以還，戰事影片，應時崛起，以視西綫無戰事，則瞠乎後矣，然不可謂非進步也。　　欲覘一國之風俗人情，可於電影中求之。頃觀德國鳥發公司之「藍天使」一劇，其諷幾大學敎授，可謂淋漓盡致，不知我國尊嚴之敎師，對之作何感想。惜無電影家以素描我國各界之怪現狀耳！　　冒險電影，外片爲多，如白地獄寫阿爾卑斯山之雪境；人獸奇觀寫斐洲之　俗，眞令人怵目驚心，魄動神悚也。頃聞長城影片公司擬赴靑島，攝取冒險影片，中有虎豹猛獸。成績如何？會當拭當待之。　　夫小說家言，十九寓言。譬如蒲留仙之聊齋，如黃英賦菊，葛巾賦牡丹，素秋，司文郎諸篇，係夫子自道。故蒲氏自序曰：「遄飛逸興，狂固難辭；永託曠懷，癡而不諱。∶∶∶集腋成裘，妄續幽明之錄；浮白載筆，僅成孤憤之書。」則此書之爲寓言小說，可想見矣。電影何獨不然，如英國大小說家史蒂文蓀所著之化身博士，蓋一諷世作品也。書中以奇格爾博士及哈特先生二人爲描寫中心，一善一惡，截然不同，實則皆爲博士化身。博士旣服藥化身，貌如獰鬼，獸性勃發，與未化身前之温文爾雅，判若兩人。其意蓋諷剌人之内心，本非良善，亦可謂嘅夫言之矣！派拉蒙公司編爲電影，福德立馬區扮演善惡兩角，各肖其人，嘆觀止矣！嘗觀歐西名片，每有寓言之作，寄托遙深，含義深刻，吾國所當效法者也。又一位「口吃」作家  英　　還有一位明顯的結舌明星，就是ＬittleＯrphamＡnnie,片中的米西格林ＭitziＧreen，他最近在Ｓhamprol片中，飾一位結舌的幻術家，造成比以前的作品更可笑的滑稽片子。丈夫的職司  心　　耐茜卡洛的丈夫ＢoltenＭallory，衼華納公司請了去，答了一張合同，這合同只是呌他爲ＪveＥＢrian新ＹouＳaidＡＭouth，作一叚談話而已。公開書啓　　朱茉莉君鑒：銅版及新聞，俱已收到。請將原　　照片寄下，因寄來銅版，網線過細，不適本刋之用；且屬他種刋物已經用過，請原有。編者申報電影專刋投稿略例　　一本刋歡迎投稿一經登載酬報從豐　　一文字旣經登載給酬版權概屬申報所有　　一來件如係譯文應附原著　　一本刋篇幅有限文字應力求簡短每稿以五百字左右爲限　　一文字照片等等除預先聲明及附回函郵資者外概不負保存或退還之責　　一一稿兩投抄襲文字或照錄說明書不給酬　　一投稿時須加蓋印章否則以却酬論　　一稿紙勿兩面書寫電影專著甚麽是天才？  陳大悲　　驚的表情也是吸進去的一口氣呼不出來，方能像是眞的驚訝。試把吸住的一口氣對着鏡子呼出來，你看鏡中起了一種甚麽變化？是不是把驚的表情消失了一大半？　　經過這一番試騐之後，你就可以明白了吧。爲甚麽歐美各國敎授表演藝術的機關裏，第一件事就是要你用各種運動的方法來練成一種深呼吸的習慣？就因爲表情的總樞紐就在乎你的呼吸。　　你的日常生活中原有各式各樣變幻的表情。這種天然的非意識的表情正在那裏起變化的時候，你是從來沒有對着鏡子注過意的。如果正當這個時候，有一位朋友送一面鏡子給你，讓你看一看自己那副尊容，你原來的那種表情就連一秒鐘都不能維持原狀了。　　一個從未上過鏡頭或是登過舞台的人如果能夠將任何一種表情當着一班朋友維持到一分鐘以上，這個人就是演劇的天才。這樣的天才如果知道訓練自己的正當方法，他或她將來一定可以在銀幕上得到勝利。天才是甚麽？天才就是勇於訓練自己的聰敏人。「聰敏反被聰敏悮」這句老話是指那些不知或不肯訓練自己的聰敏人而言，并不是聰敏眞會悞人的呀！　　爲甚麽有些人照的像常常是很自然的，而另一種人一輩子照不出一張好像來？這因爲前者能夠當着照像機面前撑得住氣，而後者就撑不住氣。撑得住氣就是能夠調節呼吸。不會調節呼吸的人與照像機是無緣的。補救這種缺憾的最好方法就是練習深呼吸。</p>

<h3>The Executive Council Will Reconvene This Afternoon, With Lytton Explaining the Report</h3>
<p>The External Affairs Ministry Completes Drafting a Rejoinder to Japanese Counterarguments; Matsuoka Widely Visits Representatives of Major Powers to Alleviate Anti-Japanese Sentiment</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Government authorities received a telegram from Gu Weijun on the evening of the 22nd, reporting that there would be no meeting on the 22nd and that the agenda for the 23rd would include: 1) Lytton responding to the Japanese representative's arguments against the report; 2) representatives of various countries questioning the Japanese representative and inquiring whether the Japanese government has the sincerity to peacefully resolve the Sino-Japanese incident. The meeting would be suspended on the 24th and 25th and would reconvene on the 26th to submit the report and the minutes of this Executive Council meeting for approval and transfer them to the Committee of Nineteen and the League of Nations General Assembly. The rejoinder drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to refute the Japanese counterarguments has been completed and is scheduled to be released on the 23rd. As for the specialized issues in the Japanese counterarguments, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed the three representatives stationed in Geneva to refute them point by point as appropriate. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to government officials, reports from various sources and foreign newspaper articles prove that countries around the world are fully aware of Japan's aggression against China. Recently, the release of the Japanese counterarguments has further revealed its frantic attitude of blaming third parties. It is clear that Japan intends to be hostile to peace and has no regard for other countries. Therefore, the atmosphere in Geneva is becoming increasingly unfavorable to Japan. China should seize this opportunity to strengthen internal unity as a backing for diplomacy and to connect with friendly countries to support justice. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>▲ A Dentsu dispatch from Geneva on the 21st reports that in today's speech at the Council, Japanese representative Matsuoka resolutely refused to change Japan's position on the Manchurian issue. Chinese representative Gu Weijun said that he had received reports that if the Manchurian issue could not be resolved satisfactorily, the boycott of Japanese goods would likely expand. The two sides then clashed head-on, resulting in a major crisis and a state of deadlock.</p>
<p>▲ A Reuters dispatch from Geneva on the 22nd reports that the League of Nations feels that Matsuoka and Gu Weijun are both speaking from absolutely irreconcilable positions and are not seeking points of agreement based on the Lytton Report, which will make the work of the Executive Council very difficult. Therefore, the nature of the issue is very complex and cannot be resolved satisfactorily. The Council members are currently holding private talks to discuss the meeting tomorrow, but for the time being, everyone's attention has shifted to the issue of Germany and the Disarmament Conference. German Foreign Minister Neurath can only stay here for a few days and must leave by Saturday or Sunday.</p>
<p>▲ A Reuters dispatch from Geneva on the 21st reports that the discussions of the League of Nations Executive Council may not last long. The entire issue will be submitted to a special session of the League of Nations General Assembly as soon as possible, and the issue of reconvening the Committee of Nineteen will be decided by the General Assembly.</p>
<p>▲ A Dentsu dispatch from Geneva on the 21st reports that the next Council meeting is scheduled to be held at 3:30 p.m. on the 23rd. Council President Valleray and major powers such as Britain and France intend to communicate with members of the Commission of Inquiry and key figures of the countries concerned during this period to prevent empty discussions at the next Council meeting, hoping for substantive progress.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The League of Nations Executive Council convened on the 21st, with representatives from China and Japan making political statements. On the 23rd, Sir Lytton will deliver a speech to explain the report in detail, followed by speeches from representatives of various countries. This marks the beginning of the League of Nations Executive Council's formal discussion of the Lytton Report. According to diplomatic observers, Lytton's speech on the 23rd will be the same in content as his broadcast speech on the 19th, but more extensive and detailed. Diplomatic circles believe that Lytton's statement that the Commission of Inquiry does not recognize the so-called "Manchukuo" and that Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" is unreasonable is extremely fair and crucial. They also believe that the Executive Council will accept Lytton's fair opinion and formally declare that it does not recognize "Manchukuo" before the opening of the meeting. As for Lytton's statement on using conference methods to peacefully resolve disputes, they place endless hope on the League of Nations and hope that it will be realized quickly and satisfactorily. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>▲ A Hualian News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 22nd reports that, according to Japanese sources, Matsuoka Yosuke visited French representative Poncet at 7 p.m. yesterday and earnestly requested French support for Japan with certain conditions. Today, he will visit representatives of Britain, Italy, and Germany to seek their assistance.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese delegation reported its League of Nations strategy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from France yesterday: 1) Actively engage within the Executive Council to gain the understanding of the major powers and control the General Assembly; 2) declare its sincerity in upholding the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact to appease the weaker nations and avoid agitation in the General Assembly; 3) elaborate on the favorable points in the Commission of Inquiry report and refute the unfavorable points, striving to avoid disagreements with the major powers and ensuring that the Empire reaps practical benefits; 4) avoid heated debates with the Chinese side in the meeting and outwardly offer cooperation; 5) promote the resolution of the Manchurian issue by transferring it to direct negotiations between China, Japan, and "Manchukuo" as a last resort. (Shenshi News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>▲ A Reuters dispatch from London on the 22nd reports that there is much debate about whether the issue of the Three Eastern Provinces of China should be handled by the League of Nations Executive Council or the League of Nations General Assembly. There is a new proposal to convene a special meeting of the signatory countries of the 1921 Washington Treaty to handle the case. If so, the United States will also participate in the discussion. The Conservative Party's Daily Telegraph said in today's editorial that the Manchurian case is of great importance to the general problems of the world and strongly urged the government to decide on the fundamental principles on which to act if intervention is unfortunately necessary, otherwise Britain will be caught in a very dangerous dispute. Britain should not assist China's demands on the Manchurian issue, causing Japan to withdraw from the constraints of the League of Nations, as the future of the Disarmament Conference will collapse as a result, and the outcome of naval disarmament will be greatly unfavorable to Britain and the world.</p>
<h3>The Composition of the Committee of Nineteen</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the fourteen countries attending this League of Nations Executive Council meeting are Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Ireland, Guatemala, Panama, Norway, Czechoslovakia, China, and Japan. As for the composition of the Committee of Nineteen, in addition to China and Japan, the fourteen countries mentioned above also include Switzerland, Colombia, Hungary, Sweden, Belgium, Yugoslavia, and the Netherlands. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Puppet Representatives Wander in Paris</h3>
<p>▲ A Hualian News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 22nd reports that Ding Shiyuan, a puppet from the false organization, was refused entry by the Swiss government on his way from Paris to Geneva. He is currently wandering in the suburbs of Paris, in a dilemma. He has telegraphed the Kwantung Army and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo for assistance. Because the puppet cannot enter Geneva, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is extremely anxious.</p>
<h3>The United States Maintains Strict Silence</h3>
<p>▲ A Havas dispatch from Washington on the 22nd reports that since the beginning of the Geneva Conference, the State Department has been extremely silent on the issue of Manchuria, fearing that the outside world will misunderstand the attitude of the United States. However, well-informed sources believe that if the League of Nations maintains a favorable attitude toward China, all the powers will declare that they refuse to recognize "Manchukuo." It is said that the United States has long held this intention.</p>
<h3>Dr. Gu Weijun Refutes Matsuoka's Fallacies</h3>
<p>▲ A Reuters dispatch from Geneva on the 21st reports that this afternoon, Dr. Gu Weijun spoke on behalf of China at a special meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council. Gu originally intended to read from a prepared speech, but he did not fully follow it. Gu first responded to the remarks made by Japanese representative Matsuoka this morning, saying that if people believed Matsuoka's words, it would be tantamount to believing that Japan is a gentle lamb in China's embrace. Fortunately, the world has the Lytton Report to prove that this is not the case. He wants to reserve criticism of Matsuoka's points, but now he wants to say a few words.</p>
<p>▲ Discarding Sacred Treaties Even assuming that Matsuoka's words are not false, the question remains: to what extent is Japan's military aggression reasonable? If the world's interpretation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact is the same as Japan's, then what is the benefit of complying with such a treaty? He believes that it is more appropriate to interpret the nature and meaning of self-defense from the text of the Kellogg-Briand Pact itself. Gu said that he would read the Chinese government's opinion on the Lytton Report, first stating that as a Chinese staff member, he was subjected to unwarranted restrictions and prohibitions in the Three Eastern Provinces, so that he could not inspect the site of the incident, nor could he find a way to make Chinese witnesses appear before the Lytton Commission of Inquiry, while Japanese staff members enjoyed freedom everywhere in China. In comparison, the treatment was very different.</p>
<p>▲ Obstructing China's Unification One of the biggest difficulties China encounters in the process of construction is Japan's repeated actions to prevent its realization. Japan constantly accuses China of not being unified to the world, while continuing to implement its policy of preventing China's unification. Whether Japan wants China to be unified is a question. It is clear that the Japanese are concerned that China's unification will be detrimental to Japan's development policy.</p>
<p>▲ Threatening Peace in the Far East The Japanese continental policy is the crystallization of centuries of Japanese Bushido teachings, the purpose of which is to conquer Asia, with China as the first step. This continental policy is truly a great disaster for peace in the Far East. What is even more dangerous is that behind this policy there is an uncontrollable military party, which is one of the most powerful of all Japanese war machines and wants to implement its主張 with an iron fist.</p>
<p>▲ Boycotting is Passive Self-Defense The reason why the Chinese people continue the boycott movement is to oppose Japan's policy of aggression. This spontaneous mass movement cannot be completely separated from any government. This is a legitimate method of self-defense. The Chinese central government can only acquiesce to it. However, the Chinese government is closely monitoring it. This has been confirmed by the Lytton Report. Therefore, since the Japanese army began its aggression in the Three Eastern Provinces, there have been very few accidents. The Chinese government, under the current circumstances, is enacting legislation to boycott Japanese merchants and goods, and it cannot be said that it is unreasonable to formulate and implement a more consistent method of boycott. However, the fact that China has not yet taken this step is enough to show the characteristics of the Chinese government's policy of patience and moderation. The question of whether the implementation of an organized boycott is incompatible with friendly relations cannot arise until another prior question has been decided. What is this prior question? It is whether Sino-Japanese relations can still be considered friendly at a time when Japan is wantonly invading Chinese territory. China certainly wants to seek a peaceful solution through the League of Nations, but China feels that it is necessary to stop the invading army from advancing one after another whenever possible. China has chosen this form of passive resistance, which is more humane because it is bloodless. If armed resistance is used, bloodshed will inevitably occur. If it is said that China should not boycott, then it is directly剥削合法与和平的自卫工具矣.</p>
<p>▲ Unreasonable Actions of the Japanese Army The Lytton Report has proved that China's claim that the Shenyang Incident cannot be a reason for Japanese military action. Since the Shenyang Incident cannot be a reason for the Japanese army's actions there, there is even less reason for the Japanese army to simultaneously invade Chinese territory in Changchun, Jilin, and Yingkou that night. Looking at the Jinzhou Incident on October 10 last year, it is even more proof of the lack of integrity of the Japanese authorities. The Japanese have destroyed the administrative power of Jinzhou, Jilin, and many places in the Three Eastern Provinces, and still claim that there is no public order in the Three Eastern Provinces. Page 127 of the Lytton Report mentions that although the Japanese authorities have made solemn guarantees to the League of Nations, they are still carrying out their methods of coercion and assimilation. This statement is also worthy of attention.</p>
<p>▲ Resisting World Public Opinion Dr. Gu said after describing the Shanghai Incident in January of this year that there is still one thing that is shocking evidence of Japan's resistance to the world, which is Japan's formal recognition of "Manchukuo," completely disregarding the solemn responsibilities of the League of Nations Covenant and international treaties, as well as its repeated promises to the League of Nations Executive Council. If the Japanese do not want to take over China's sovereignty and replace it, then the actions of the Japanese army in South Manchuria will have no purpose. China is concerned about this, and the Japanese authorities have angrily refuted it. However, neutral news agencies, such as the Associated Press and Reuters, have reported that the Japanese are actively seizing the civil administration of the Three Eastern Provinces.</p>
<p>▲ Reserving Claims for Compensation Dr. Gu continued that the solution to this issue should be left to a special session of the League of Nations General Assembly. China has been guaranteed against foreign aggression, and now it cannot allow China to abandon its rights before the aggression as a result of this aggression. The Lytton Report approves of the Chinese government's attitude and believes that any discussion between China and other countries must be held under the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, based on China's rights. The Chinese government is prepared to use any suggestion that is consistent with this general principle as the basis for discussion. The Chinese government reserves the right to claim compensation for Japan's acts of aggression.</p>
<p>▲ Unfulfilled Obligation to Withdraw Troops Japan's obligation to withdraw troops under the repeated resolutions of the League of Nations last year still exists. The withdrawal of troops is still necessary and is a prerequisite for the fundamental resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute. The pressure of military occupation and the pressure of faits accomplis obtained by force must be eliminated. This is a necessary move. If this necessity is not recognized, then the solution to this dispute cannot be properly discussed.</p>
<p>▲ Quickly Adopt Effective Measures The Lytton Report describes the true situation in the Three Eastern Provinces in detail and clearly. The time has come for the League of Nations to take swift and effective action, to uphold justice, and to maintain world peace. The only way to do this is to quickly and effectively resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict based on the principles of fairness and justice stipulated in international treaties. This is what China hopes for. Dr. Gu's speech devoted a portion to a historical account of Japan from the 16th century to the Tanaka Memorial, in order to prove Japan's unchanging ambitions towards China. The Executive Council adjourned at 6:05 p.m. The next meeting is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday.</p>
<p>▲ A Reuters dispatch from Geneva on the 21st reports that Matsuoka told guests today that Dr. Gu Weijun's陈述 had nothing new. He greatly admired the Chinese representative's polite speech, as if it came from an old friend. As for the Tanaka Memorial mentioned by Dr. Gu, he can point out the name of the forger when necessary. He believes that there is no need to refute the Chinese complaints, but he is only prepared to detail the situation in China.</p>
<h3>Japan Threatens to Withdraw from the League of Nations, But People in the League of Nations Do Not Mind</h3>
<p>▲ A Guomin News Agency dispatch from Geneva on the 22nd reports that many representatives in the League of Nations have always regarded Japan's threats to withdraw from the League of Nations as insignificant. Today, they have paid a little more attention than before, but few still believe that the Japanese are determined to implement it. Recently, newspapers have interpreted Japan's views on the Lytton Report and Matsuoka's speech at the League of Nations as indicating that the Japanese representative has been ordered to withdraw if the actions of the League of Nations are not satisfactory to the Japanese. Therefore, the representatives have also turned to pay attention to it, and at the same time informally discussed the issue of the islands in the South Pacific entrusted to Japan, and whether they can be a powerful factor to prevent Japan from withdrawing from the League of Nations. However, this has raised a serious question of whether Japan would be willing to have the League of Nations take back the entrusted rule and entrust it to another country after it has been entrusted with the rule. One observer said that these islands are the first naval defense line for Japan's attack on the East. Although they are scattered over 100,000 square miles of ocean, their position is enough to endanger the communication lines between the United States and the Philippines, and between the Panama Canal and the Philippines. Naval experts here all say that if there is a naval battle between Japan and the United States in the Pacific, Japan can use these islands as naval bases to block American warships, which will make it difficult for the American fleet to succeed without the help of the British fleet. Since these islands are so important to Japan, the Japanese will not easily give them up. If the League of Nations really intends to transfer them to another country, the United States will also compete for them. Another observer believes that if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations and refuses to give up the entrusted islands, it will inevitably convene a meeting of the signatory countries of the Four-Power Treaty of Britain, the United States, France, and Japan.</p>
<p>The British People's Rights Alliance Issues an Important Declaration</p>
<h3>Even if Japan Withdraws from the League of Nations, It Will Still Be Bound by the Covenant</h3>
<p>▲ A Guomin News Agency dispatch from London on the 21st reports that today, the People's Rights Alliance issued a declaration signed by Lansbury (leader of the Labour Party) and Wells, stating that the crisis in the Sino-Japanese dispute is developing and will have a decisive impact not only on the future of the Far East, but also on the issue of disarmament. It is worrying that Japan will decide to withdraw from the League of Nations after the League of Nations has a resolution that the Japanese deem unfavorable. However, one point must be clarified: even if Japan decides to withdraw from the League of Nations, it will still be bound by the Covenant unless it has fulfilled its international obligations under the League of Nations Covenant. Furthermore, if Britain expresses its willingness to cooperate with the United States to jointly maintain the Nine-Power Treaty, it may still be able to prevent Japan from withdrawing from the League of Nations. Finally, the People's Rights Alliance also suggested that if the League of Nations General Assembly declares Japan to be a treaty-breaking aggressor, then all countries should immediately ban the sale of all arms and ammunition to Japan.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Opinions from Various Countries</h3>
<p>▲ A Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 21st reports that only two newspapers today have editorials discussing the Eastern Provinces incident, and these two editorials can represent the views of the two extremes. The "Liberté," a right-wing newspaper that has always been pro-Japanese, said that Japan is maintaining order in an area of anarchy and is fulfilling an obligation to mankind. The "Le Peuple," a pro-Chinese socialist newspaper, said that the League of Nations should maintain its prestige and force Japan to return the Eastern Provinces to China. It is generally believed that the League of Nations has encountered a major crisis.</p>
<p>▲ A Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 22nd reports that French newspapers have little criticism of the arguments of the Chinese and Japanese representatives. The Paris Morning Post said in today's editorial that observing the reasons held by both sides, there is clearly no appropriate procedure for reconciliation and mediation. The League of Nations seems to be careful to decline and let others handle it. Moreover, the opinions of the League of Nations General Assembly are divergent, and it is especially necessary to follow this path. Le Petit Parisien questioned the qualifications of the League of Nations Executive Council, saying that the matter should be handled by the League of Nations General Assembly, because it is the General Assembly that can decide such issues.</p>
<p>▲ A Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 22nd reports that only the Germania newspaper in Germany criticized the meeting in Geneva yesterday, saying that the League of Nations will not change its old ways on the Manchurian issue. It has made no decision in the past fourteen months and will still shelve it without a decision. The tragedy of the Manchurian conflict shows that the League of Nations is an inadequate and incomplete organization, and is not sufficient to carry out the important work proposed by Herriot in his construction plan. Britain and France have never had the enthusiasm for decisive action, and the repeated delays of the Manchurian issue are related to Britain and France. What Germany is most concerned about is avoiding a precedent, fearing that Germany will be in the same position in the future and will be adversely affected by this precedent. The newspaper concluded pessimistically that the hope of resolving the Far Eastern conflict in Geneva is equal to zero.</p>
<p>▲ A Reuters dispatch from Ottawa on the 21st reports that Canada will not criticize the debate in Geneva for the time being and will express its views after the League of Nations discusses the Sino-Japanese dispute. Prime Minister Bennett said in the House of Commons today that Canada's representative in Geneva will take an honest and selfless attitude toward Sino-Japanese relations. It is not appropriate for the government to make a hasty comment without studying the debate on land disputes in detail.</p>
<p>▲ A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 22nd reports that all evening newspapers published the speeches of the Chinese and Japanese representatives at yesterday's League of Nations Executive Council meeting in a prominent position, but did not comment on them. Although the newspapers focus on the debate at the League of Nations in Geneva, they pay even more attention to the dispute between the Minister of Railways and the Minister of the Interior regarding the budget for civil engineering procedures. If the public cannot agree on a settlement, the cabinet may break down.</p>

<h3>Andong Righteous Army Breaks Prison</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) Sixty-eight members of the Liaodong Righteous Army were arrested in Andong County and imprisoned in two separate locations. Last night at 11:30 PM, they simultaneously broke out of prison and escaped. Upon receiving the news, the Japanese military police immediately dispatched officers to investigate. They found only the prison cells broken open and could not discover any traces of the escapees. The Japanese side suspects that the Chinese guards were bought off by the Righteous Army as inside accomplices and are interrogating the Chinese patrolmen at the Japanese military police headquarters. Fearing that the Righteous Army may take the opportunity to attack Japanese residents, the garrison has deployed troops to guard all passes, according to a special dispatch on the 22nd.</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Conflict Beyond Geneva Also -- Xuan</h3>
<p>1.  The Focal Point of the Sino-Japanese Conflict</p>
<p>The Executive Council of the League of Nations convened in Geneva on the 21st at 11:00 AM. The main agenda item was the discussion of the "Lytton Report." Thus, the diplomatic battle lines between China and Japan have been drawn. In terms of personnel, our representative, Mr. Gu Weijun, is a leading figure in the diplomatic world. The Japanese side's Matsuoka Yosuke is also a talented individual jointly recommended by their military and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Although Japan vigorously promotes the argument that the League of Nations has an "insufficient understanding" of Eastern issues, it proceeds cautiously in international diplomacy. Their written rebuttal to the Lytton Report does everything possible to slander our country. On the other hand, they spare no effort in sophistry to justify their aggression and occupation, claiming that Japan's attack on the three northeastern provinces was for the sake of peace in the Orient, out of self-defense, to protect Japan's security, and to maintain the sanctity of treaties. However, examining the reality, international treaties such as the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which are jointly adhered to by the world, have been turned into waste paper by Japanese swords and guns. Although the original order in the three northeastern provinces was not ideal, the people could still manage to live there. Since being violently seized by the Japanese military, roads are almost impassable, and the fields are barren. What is this called tranquility? Where is the peace?</p>
<p>We have long stated that the League of Nations is powerless. Currently, various countries in the world are plagued by economic recession. Although countries like the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are nominally leaders, they are, in fact, outwardly strong but inwardly weak, lacking the real strength to restrain Japan's violence and monopoly. Therefore, we believe that seeking assistance from foreigners and seeking justice within the framework of the League of Nations will inevitably be fruitless.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addressing the China-Japan problem outside of Geneva diplomacy, China should adopt a practical national struggle that relies on its own strength, possessing a strong determination and establishing a long-term plan. Only then can we engage in a life-or-death battle with our current powerful enemy.</p>
<p>Let us further elaborate on this. The weakness of our military strength and the impoverishment of our people in addressing the Northeast issue are important factors in our failure. Moreover, our country has a vast territory, abundant natural resources, and a dense population, further characterized by future market expansion. Various countries are expanding their commercial influence in China. Are we willing to lag behind forever and become mere carriers of goods for others? Or will we rise up and become self-reliant? What various countries lack and suffer from most at present is commodity surplus and a narrow market. We have a vast market but cannot make good use of it, leading to exploitation by a powerful enemy. Japan is nominally a strong country, but economically, it has extremely limited natural resources such as minerals, forestry products, and agricultural products, and cannot be self-sufficient. Its specialty lies in the textile industry. Although our country is relatively backward, it is not difficult to engage in economic competition with Japan in a short period. Moreover, Japan is already feeling the narrowness of its market and has goods but nowhere to sell them. The only market is in our country. If we can rise up in time and engage in active economic competition with them, using our own domestic market to counter their crudely manufactured goods, we should have lasting resistance, no matter how weak our country may be.</p>
<p>2.  National Mobilization</p>
<p>Before Japan seized our three northeastern provinces, it called on its citizens with the unified slogan: "National Crisis Imminent." It used the pretext of "Manchuria" being its national defense line and lifeline to inspire its citizens. Therefore, before the September 18th Incident occurred, the Second Division and the Twentieth Division had already secretly mobilized and moved to the South Manchuria Railway area to carry out the occupation of Liaoning and Jilin provinces. Although the military authorities in the area adopted a policy of non-resistance, patriotic youths refused to retreat, willingly fighting for the nation and sacrificing themselves. They rose up from the fields, wielding outdated weapons to confront the Japanese military. Although they did not deal a fatal blow to Japan or recover the lost territories, the Japanese warlords were clearly flustered. The slogan of national mobilization has spread throughout Japan. In addition to the original force of approximately 40,000 troops that created the September 18th Incident, the Eighth Division ("West"), the Tenth Division ("Hirose"), the Fourteenth Division ("Matsuki"), and other special units were added to "Manchuria," totaling no less than 100,000 troops. As a result, not only did they fail to pacify the Northeast, but they also made the order in that region increasingly chaotic. However, their ambition has not been slightly curbed, and they have also carried out economic mobilization, implementing a widespread dumping policy, suffocating the sales of Chinese-made products in the Chinese market. Only then can Japan's policy of monopoly be developed, and only then can there be a way out for imperialist aggression.</p>
<p>At this time, our country is in this difficult situation, subjected to their military oppression and economic encirclement. If we only seek to open up a new path through diplomatic negotiations, we fear that we will ultimately have no way to preserve ourselves. We can only improve our national front, on the one hand, and devote our full efforts to economic construction on the other. We must resolutely abandon the empty talk of the past and bury ourselves in work, rectify internal affairs, restore old industries, and develop new industries. Then, the current unemployed masses will gradually disappear, and the social unrest will naturally be cleared away. Do we not see the Soviet Union? Their current First and Second Five-Year Plans are fundamentally very similar to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's nation-building strategies. They were able to make rapid economic progress in four years. Although our country and Soviet ideology take different paths, their efforts in industrial construction are indeed valuable lessons for our country to learn from. Our citizens should strive for economic development and construction, and we must not delay any longer. The China-Japan problem must be based on the economic strength of the nation as a competitive foundation. As for the boycott movement, it seems to be an active action on the surface, but in essence, it is still passive work. It only stops at boycotting goods, which only makes the other side feel pain, while we ourselves have not established anything. Therefore, our national mobilization does not necessarily have to rely entirely on military victories or diplomatic negotiations. The final settlement will depend on the efforts of our citizens in economic construction.</p>
<p>Chongqing Troops Enter Luzhou City; Tang, Pan, and Wang Divisions Advance Westward</p>
<h3>Rumored to Have Occupied Weiyuan, Rongxian, Jiang'an, Etc.; Liu Xiang States That He Will Not Cease Military Operations Until Xufu is Captured; Chongqing Telegram Claims That the 24th Army Has Retreated and is Stationed in Jiading</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Liu Wenhui's troops abandoned Luzhou on the 19th and concentrated towards Xufu. Chongqing troops entered Luzhou City on the 21st. The city was nearly half destroyed by aerial bombing, with many refugees. Gentry and merchants are organizing disaster relief. Liu Xiang stated that he will not cease military operations until Xufu is captured. Therefore, the Tang, Pan, and Wang divisions continue to advance. It is rumored that the right wing has occupied Weiyuan and Rongxian, and the left wing has occupied Jiang'an, which is about a hundred miles away from the rear of the provincial army, according to a special dispatch on the 22nd.</p>
<p>(Hankou) Deng Xihou telegraphed on the 19th, stating that he resolutely requested a ceasefire from all parties in response to the demands of the people, with a firm intention. All the generals responded immediately with telegrams of support. It is heard that Liu Wenhui will be the first to agree and that he will also issue another telegram stating the process of continuous concessions, expressing his unwillingness to prolong or expand the war. He only seeks to preserve some vitality during the national crisis. He is willing to sacrifice everything. It is heard that he will further abandon Xufu and retreat to Jiading if necessary, and is even willing to make concessions to Tian. There are currently no conflicts between the two armies in Chengdu City, but they are still confronting each other outside the city, according to a special dispatch on the 22nd.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain agency received a telegram from Chongqing on the 20th, stating that Pan's division of the 21st Army is attacking Xufu. Tang's division occupied Rongxian on the 20th, and Xu's brigade occupied Weiyuan, according to a special dispatch on the 22nd.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) News from the Sichuan Army Representative Office: (1) Liu Xiang's troops crossed Nanxi and advanced towards Xufu, only a river away from the provincial army. The air force followed them to Luzhou and flew to Xufu to threaten them. The strength of the 24th Army has been reduced by two-fourths and cannot hold out for long. (2) As a result of the street fighting in Chengdu, Liu and Tian's troops suffered a total of more than 600 deaths and more than 1,000 injuries each. Approximately 3,000 civilians died. More than 400 buildings in the main street were burned down. The losses in the city outskirts or alleys are not counted. All of the most valuable shops have been destroyed, with total losses exceeding ten million. The people are panicked and are leaving the province to avoid the chaos. Deng Xihou's announcement to dissuade them has been ineffective. (3) The allied generals are extremely angry at Liu Wenhui's use of divisive schemes and collusion with Tian's rebellious troops, and they advocate for their complete annihilation, according to a special dispatch on the 22nd.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Xiang telegraphed to Nanjing on the 20th, stating that the enemy troops in Luzhou City had sent deputies and foreign gentry to express their willingness to be reorganized.

Liu Xiang transferred from Luzhou to Zijing to supervise the battle. The vanguard of the Chongqing army has reached Weiyuan and Rongxian. Zhang Qingping, Yang Shangzhou, Tian Boshi, and Gao Yucong, the division commander and brigade commanders who were ordered by Liu Wenhui to defend Luzhou, totaling more than 7,000 people, were surrounded and disarmed by Liu Xiang's army. Deng Xihou's chief of staff, Diao Wenjun, was killed by Liu Wenhui's troops. Deng was furious and ordered Huang Yin and Ma Dezhai's divisions, as well as Yang Xiuchun and Chen Li's brigades, to join the allied forces in attacking Liu, according to a special dispatch on the 22nd.</p>

Liu's situation is increasingly precarious, according to a special dispatch on the 22nd.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At today's Executive Yuan meeting, Gu Mengyu and others proposed a plan to govern Sichuan. Later, Song Ziwen and others received a telegram from Chiang, stating that the settlement of the Sichuan war was imminent and that it would be appropriate to wait a little longer to avoid making a decision that could not be implemented at the time. The majority of the attendees agreed with Chiang's opinion. Therefore, it was decided to postpone the discussion of the Sichuan matter, according to a special dispatch on the 22nd.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sichuanese Alumni Association of National Central University, heartbroken by the disaster in Sichuan, formed a Sichuan Governance Plan Research Association. They held a meeting on the 22nd and divided into five groups to study: (1) military affairs, (2) civil administration, (3) education, (4) finance, and (5) construction. They will draft a plan to submit to the Executive Yuan for reference. The association also issued a declaration, denouncing the crimes of warlords and the suffering of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies in the defense zones, the bankruptcy of education and industry, and the spread of the current war and its devastating effects on the lives and property of the people, stating that the people of Sichuan should seek self-determination as soon as possible to avoid being constantly devastated and to rise up together, according to a special dispatch on the 22nd.</p>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Talk</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang told visiting reporters that he deeply hopes that the proposals of the Third Plenary Session can be implemented. The proposals I made at the First and Second Plenary Sessions have not been implemented. This time, I have several proposals that I am drafting and will continue to submit. Regarding the proposal to recover lost territories by force, I received a telegram from Luo Wengan at the end of last month, and rumors spread that I was participating in the restoration, so I sent a telegram to the Jiang, which was omitted in the newspaper. When a country is about to perish, it should endure hardship and bide its time, but they are lying down and collecting salaries. Ma Zhanshan, Zhu Jiqing, Ding Chao, and Li Du are all fighting hard in the freezing weather. The Chinese people should learn from the righteous army who have backbone. I will reside in Zhangjiakou for a long time and do not want to go elsewhere. I have compiled a book criticizing the League of Nations report, which will be published soon. The main idea is that one must work hard to find a way out, according to a special dispatch on the 22nd.</p>

<h3>Retreating Sacrifice Soldiers for the Japanese are often Subject to Machine Gun Fire</h3>
<p>(Beiping) When the Japanese army fights in Manchuria, it uses the rebel army on the front line, and the Japanese soldiers supervise the battle in the rear. Because of the relationship between Su Bingwen, Gong Changhai, and the soldiers in the puppet army, they are unwilling to fight hard. The Japanese soldiers severely oppress them in the rear. If they retreat, they will be fired upon with machine guns. More puppet soldiers are killed by the Japanese army than die in battle. The Japanese attack the large part of the Righteous Army, and dispersed the small part of the Righteous Army, intending to make it impossible for the Righteous Army to hide in the villages, and the people are unable to live in peace. Japanese people can enjoy the land rights of their land. Their plan is extremely vicious, according to a special dispatch on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Orders Puppet Organizations to Force Each County to Increase Troops, to be Trained by Japanese Officers for Three Months in Preparation for Invading Rehe</h3>

<h3>Chairman Chiang is Preparing to go to Jiangxi to Supervise the Suppression of Bandits and Will Transfer to Nanjing to Attend the Third Plenary Session; the Chu You and Wei Sheng Warships are Firing Up and Ready to Depart</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The communist bandit tide in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui will be eliminated.

<p>(Nanchang) Military news says that Lin Biao, Peng Dehuai, Dong Zhentang, Luo Binghui, and Xiao Ke's forces of Zhu Mao have less than 20,000 guns. Because the 19th Route Army is pursuing them from western Fujian and Zhao Guantao and Wang Jinwen of eastern Jiangxi are blocking them on the Zhejiang border, they have no way to go, so they fled from Zixi to Jinxi to spy on Fuzhou. In addition to ordering Mao Bingwen's troops to cut off the bandits' return route from the Fujian border, the headquarters of the three provinces also sent multiple aircraft to bomb Nancheng, Zixi, and Jinxi. The bandits who invaded Huwan are in a difficult situation and will not be difficult to eliminate. The morale of the people in Fuzhou has stabilized.

<h3>Executive Yuan Resolution: Zhu Jiahuai Reports on the Handling of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; the Shandong Provincial Government Approves Liu Zhennian's Resignation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held its 77th meeting on the 22nd, attended by Huang Shaoxiong, Luo Wengan, Gu Mengyu, Zhu Jiahuai, Shi Qingyang, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Gongbo, Liu Ruiheng, Chen Shuren, and Song Ziwen.

(4) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Chairman Shi's submission regarding the draft organizational law of the Mongolian Banner Propaganda Envoys Office, the general budget for the 21st year, the list of salaries for employees, and the revised organization law, etc., which were reviewed and organized, please review and approve, was passed, according to a special dispatch on the 22nd.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahuai reported to the Executive Yuan on the 22nd on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company case, as follows: This is to report on the matter. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the foreign China General Edison Company secretly signed a 30 million tael loan contract on September 5th and 6th of this year by former Supervisor Chen Fumu and former General Manager Li Guojie, and it was not reported to the Ministry of Communications. On November 11th, the four docks were suddenly transferred to the China General Edison Company for takeover. In the meantime, the Ministry of Communications issued strict orders on November 8th and 10th to investigate. The former General Manager Li Guojie then sent someone on the 12th to submit the contract, and secretly reported the contents on the 13th, requesting leniency. It was said that 300,000 taels of silver were obtained by secretly negotiating with the China General Edison Company by issuing a receipt from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the checks from HSBC and Citibank were handed over to Chen Fumu, etc. He also publicly admitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government that there was nothing different. The then-President of the Yuan ordered Shanghai Mayor Wu to order the Public Security Bureau to place Li Guojie under surveillance first, pending investigation. Subsequently, an order from the Yuan was received to thoroughly investigate and report. We immediately ordered the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to thoroughly investigate and report, and sent Li Guojie to the court for investigation and prosecution, and sent a telegram to the former supervisor, Chen Fumu, to come to Beijing immediately for questioning. According to the first and second telegrams, it was still said that he was waiting for the boat to return to Shanghai, but there was no definite date. After sending a telegram ordering him to come to Beijing immediately, two long telegrams suddenly came, strongly arguing and sophistry, with many evasions. His intention was to incite shareholders to confuse the public and create political problems in order to cover up his crimes. I believe that the case is significant, involves criminal statutes, and should await the court to handle it according to law. All the circumstances of handling the case are summarized in this report and respectfully submitted for your review. Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahuai, according to a telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The organizational regulations of the Mongolian Banner Propaganda Envoys Office were passed by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 22nd.

<h3>Recent Central Tax Revenues</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the rebels seized the Northeast Customs, central government revenues have decreased by approximately two million [currency unit] per month. However, since implementing the policy of collecting taxes elsewhere, with careful management, national tax revenues have increased by about one million compared to the previous month. This month, the increase may exceed 1.5 million. Reasons: (1) Since August 4th, when customs duties on seven types of luxury goods were increased, monthly tax revenues, according to the original plan, could increase by one million. (2) Although the Northeast customs duties, nominally ours since the September 18th Incident last year, had in reality long been plundered completely, after the government formulated countermeasures and implemented the collection of Northeast customs duties elsewhere, tax revenues have seen some improvement. Next month is a peak month for customs duties and should see a further increase. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Case of Portugal Attempting to Occupy Hengqin Island</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Guangzhou Southwest National Foreign Affairs Association telegraphed about the dispute over Portugal occupying Hengqin Island. Another diplomat said that although the boundary line between Great and Small Hengqin Islands was not clearly demarcated in the 1887 Sino-Portuguese Treaty, it can be recognized as Chinese territory without a doubt. In the late Qing Dynasty, the Boundary Demarcation Minister, who was senior and humble, also did not demarcate the line. Some people suspect that the Macau side intends to invade and occupy the islands, but according to Portugal's explanation, there is absolutely no intention to invade and occupy. We also believe that the occupation is inaccurate, as Macau is adjacent to our territory, and a policy of peace and friendship should be adopted to ensure peaceful coexistence. The best solution now is for the Portuguese government to work with Tang Shaoyi to first demarcate a temporary boundary on the spot, clarifying the boundary of Hengqin and the territorial waters to avoid further misunderstandings. In the future, the central government should appoint a special boundary demarcation commissioner to formally demarcate the boundary with the Portuguese government's representative, which would be in line with the procedure. It is not known whether the Macau government can proceed accordingly. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Gongbo Talks About the Steel Plant Site Not Yet Determined</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo told people that the two previously assumed sites for the steel plant, Ma'anshan and Xiejiadian in Pukou, each have advantages and disadvantages, and the German businessmen also have their own opinions. In terms of terrain, Ma'anshan seems to be superior to Xiejiadian, but in terms of transportation, the opposite is true. The daily output of the steel plant is estimated to be more than 500 tons. Only 15 tons per day are needed for national defense. The remaining sales must seek convenient transportation to reduce costs in order to compete with foreign goods. The Ministry has now entrusted military experts to redraw the plant map and conduct precise research. Because the matter concerns national defense and is one of the central government's major construction projects, we must seriously consider the matter to avoid future regrets. Recently, I have sent my personal opinions to Chairman Chiang, seeking his views. It is expected that a decision can only be made after the Third Plenary Session. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Parliament Reopens</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 22nd: The British Parliament reopened today. The King and Queen attended the Parliament and delivered a speech, mentioning world problems, national finances, and the general economic situation. He especially hoped for the success of the World Economic Conference and good results from disarmament. He continued that regarding the proposals for the Indian constitution, the government will submit them to Parliament for resolution once the Round Table Conference is concluded. He also said that the government will soon put forward measures on unemployment insurance and other unemployment problems. This Parliament session was originally intended to focus on domestic affairs, but it will also address foreign affairs. At the beginning of the session, the US war debt issue is most important. A week ago, it was expected that the US would accept the UK's proposal to extend the payment deadline. However, according to news coming from the US every day, this hope may not be reliable. The British budget does not include funds for repaying the war debt. If the US must repay the debt, then it will be necessary to propose a supplementary budget and raise 28 million pounds sterling to cover it.</p>
<h3>Committee Meeting Convenes</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 22nd: The organizing committee of the World Economic Conference met today, chaired by British Foreign Secretary Simon.

US representative Davis, one of the organizing committee members, said today that China is the largest silver-using country in the world, so China may be able to join the preparatory committee because of this statement. However, whether China should participate in the preliminary discussions will be decided by the preparatory committee itself. Recently, a Norwegian representative joined the preparatory committee.</p>
<h3>Consultation on War Debt Issue</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 21st: President Hoover is seeking to reduce next year's government budget by more than 500 million US dollars and is now focusing on consulting with Roosevelt on the war debt issue. He has scheduled a meeting with cabinet members tomorrow. At the President's request, the budget has been revised to reduce the number set by the White House by about 700 million US dollars, but due to the increase in interest payments on government bonds and the repayment of taxes, 150 million US dollars must be deducted from this number.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, New York, 21st: Due to concerns that the deadline for the suspension of war debt payments may not be extended, the price of the British pound fell to its lowest level this year today. Because Congress is largely opposed, it is believed that if Roosevelt does not vigorously advocate extending the suspension of war debt payments, then President Hoover may not propose an extension. Roosevelt seems determined not to advocate an extension.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, London, 22nd: "The Morning Post" published a Washington dispatch stating that the talks between President Hoover and President-elect Roosevelt not only involved the discussion of the war debt issue, but also the World Economic Conference and the Far East issue. It is now believed that the press release issued after the meeting will not disclose the conclusions of the talks.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Hopes for Forming a Cabinet Remain Slim</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 21st: Hitler's hopes for forming a cabinet remain extremely slim. Hitler, his confidants, and former Deutsche Bank president Dr. Schacht spent from noon to evening today drafting a reply to President Hindenburg's conditions for appointing him as Chancellor. The conditions are as follows: (1) The members of the new cabinet must be approved by the President. (2) The President reserves the right to appoint General Schleicher as Minister of Defense and Neurath as Minister of Foreign Affairs. (3) The President requires that the new government's economic plan must be approved by him. (4) The new government should guarantee not to restore the "dualism" between Germany and Prussia. (5) The new cabinet must not attempt to reduce the powers granted to the President by Article 40 of the Constitution. Hitler is now trying his best to draft a reply that will satisfy the President, but political circles feel that Hitler's hopes of forming a cabinet under these conditions are very slim. Even if he fully accepts the President's conditions, he will not be able to obtain a majority of support in the parliament, as the Center Party has no strong desire to support him, and Hugenberg's National People's Party is very opposed to it. Hugenberg has not yet spoken to Hitler, but has refused to meet with Goering, the parliament chairman of the Nazi Party. If Hitler fails, President Hindenburg will likely ask the leader of the Center Party, Kaas, to try to obtain a majority in the parliament, but if the Nazi Party opposes it, Kaas will also fail. At this point, the President will only have one way out: to organize a presidential cabinet with a neutral leader, while retaining most of the members of the current government.</p>
<h3>Commemoration of the 400th Anniversary of the Merger of Navarre with France</h3>
<p>▲ Havas, 21st: Landes, France: Within the city of Landes, at the place where the order for the merger of Navarre with France was signed, the event is now 400 years ago. The whole city celebrated today. Prime Minister Herriot arrived late due to an accident on the railway, but the celebration ceremony proceeded as scheduled. The crowd flocked to the station to welcome the Prime Minister. The arrival of the train was met with thunderous cheers. Herriot went straight to the City Hall, where the Mayor gave a simple speech, stating that 400 years ago, the Princess of Navarre married the King of France, and Navarre was incorporated into France without any war. Herriot replied, saying that he would continue to strive to complete what Briand had not finished, in order to avoid the recurrence of war.</p>
<h3>En Route to Denmark via Paris</h3>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 22nd: Soviet Russian Communist Party leader Trotsky, traveling from Turkey to Denmark to lecture on the Russian Revolution, stopped in Italy to visit attractions. Yesterday, he took a ship from Italy to Marseilles and immediately transferred to a car to Lyon. This morning at 6:30, he arrived by train in Paris. Reporters and photographers flocked to the station to wait. The police also sent people to the station to maintain order, strictly prohibiting the crowd from getting too close to Trotsky, in order to avoid accidents. The French government only allowed Trotsky to stay in Paris for a few hours. Trotsky complied with the order and is scheduled to take an express train to Denmark tonight at 8 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Chinese Business Company</h3>
<p>According to the principles of economics, investors should not only have sufficient profits for all savings trust assets, but also have the most reliable guarantee. Our company is the earliest established real estate trading market in Shanghai, with a history of more than 20 years. The paid-up capital has reached 5 million taels. Last year's business, only in terms of real estate and mortgage departments, was more than 45,632,300 taels. There are also real estate management, rental housing, insurance trusts, and other income.</p>
<p>Our company introduces real estate transactions rather than real estate speculators. The comparative statement of last year's business is listed below:</p>
<p>Assets: 12,341,720 taels, 3 mace, 1 candareen.</p>
<p>Real estate actual price: 3,351,055 taels, 8 mace, 4 candareens.</p>
<p>Cash: 1,844,259 taels, 1 mace, 1 candareen. In the past 20 years, the company has operated more than 100 million taels in mortgages, and both principal and interest have been paid off. Real estate mortgage (real estate is kept by the company): 5,971,200 taels. Issued bond notes: 4,840,700 taels. The income from the bond notes and 1,131,500 taels from the company's capital are all used for mortgage business. The following is an excerpt from the chairman's report at the 1931 shareholders' meeting held on February 29 this year:</p>
<p>In terms of investment, bondholders and shareholders of our company are both shareholders of the company and should enjoy the benefits they deserve. According to the amount of interest paid in the past two years, we know that the interest earned by bondholders is 8%, not 6%, which is justified. Looking at the future trend, all the most successful businesses will follow the principle of beneficial sharing. I am afraid that in a few years, even those who run banking businesses will, in addition to the floating interest rate payable to depositors, allocate a portion of the surplus earned from the deposits to the depositors. All the money received by the company under the bond item, because the company is not a speculative company, so no money is allocated for the purchase of real estate. The income is used for first-class real estate mortgage. This bond is not only guaranteed by the value of the mortgaged property, but also makes the bond have a double guarantee, that is, the bondholders of the company have the priority to enjoy all the assets of the company. All of these are clearly stated on the company's receipts and payments. If you examine it carefully, you will know that each bond is backed by assets worth three times the value of the bond as a guarantee for the repayment of the bond when it matures.</p>

<h3>A Eulogy to Brigade Commander Zhang Zhankui of the 14th Brigade of the Army and All Armed Comrades for Their Virtuous Governance</h3>
<p>I lament that Shangqiu has been suffering from bandits for years, and the people are living in misery. This spring, bandit Li Gongcheng took the opportunity to mutiny and fled into the county. He also colluded with bandit leaders Liu Laoqi and Wei Quezi, wandering around dozens of counties in eastern Henan, burning, killing, raping, and plundering, with great momentum. In the battle of Yanglou, nearly a hundred members of our county's militia were killed or wounded. Fortunately, Brigade Commander Zhang Zhankui of the 14th Cavalry Brigade, together with the 1st Division and 2nd Brigade of the Provincial Security Regiment, personally led the cavalry to pursue and suppress them fiercely. After dozens of battles of various sizes, the thousands of bandits were almost all killed. Later, Liu and Wei gathered the remnants of the bandits in Luzhe, totaling six or seven hundred people. Brigade Commander Zhang again sent Regiment Commander Yang to cooperate with Regiment Commander Cheng to vigorously pursue and suppress them, completely dispersing them at Fengling, a subordinate of the county. Now, all counties are thoroughly clearing the countryside, the local area is stable, and the people are at peace, all thanks to Brigade Commander Zhang and all armed comrades. Moreover, military discipline is strict, and wherever they go, they do not violate even the slightest thing, which is a characteristic of the bandit suppression army. The people are grateful for their virtue and specially publish in the newspaper to praise them. Shangqiu County, all sectors and the people praise together.</p>

<h3>The Future of Withdrawing from the League of Nations and the South Seas Mandate (Continued)</h3>
<p>(Professor Hikomatsu Kamikawa, Tokyo Imperial University, Japan)</p>
<p>▲ The League of Nations has the right to interpret the views adopted by the League of Nations in the past, and the most appropriate interpretation of the League of Nations Covenant should be the following theory, that is, the mandate has dual powers. The decision of the mandatory power and its changes belong to the main Allied and Associated Powers, but the administration of the mandated territory should be carried out in the name of the League of Nations and must be subject to the supervision of the League of Nations. In other words, the mandated territory is under the joint rule of the main Allied and Associated Powers and the League of Nations. This view was adopted by the Council of the League of Nations on August 5, 1920, in the Imans Report, which is the authorized interpretation adopted by the international community in the past, and there should be no errors.</p>
<p>▲ What attitude will the League of Nations take? The above international law considerations have been completed, and now it is time to observe the international political aspects. The theories about the granting and deprivation of the mandate power are as diverse as mentioned in the previous article. However, when Japan clashed head-on with the League of Nations due to the Manchurian Incident, resulting in its withdrawal from the League of Nations, what kind of theory would the League of Nations adopt? (?) This can only be determined by comprehensively observing the actual situation in international politics, the aversion of the League of Nations countries to Japan, and other various situations. It must not be rashly prejudged. However, I believe that the theory most easily adopted by the League of Nations should be the last one that the League of Nations adopted as an authoritative interpretation and has been adopted. If the League of Nations adopts this theory, what will be the status of Japan, the mandatory power, at that time? (?) It is not difficult to predict. Because according to this theory, all mandated territories should be under the joint control of the main Allied and Associated Powers and the League of Nations. If our country consistently opposes it, the League of Nations will not be able to deprive us of the mandate over the South Seas Islands. Needless to say.</p>
<p>▲ Because Japan is no longer a member of the League of Nations, a situation will arise where it acts as a mandated power by the League of Nations. Regarding this point, in the implementation of the mandate, we must be prepared to encounter various difficulties. According to Article 22, Paragraphs 7 and 9 of the League of Nations Covenant, the mandatory power should submit an annual report on the mandated territory to the League of Nations, which will be reviewed by the Permanent Mandates Commission. As a non-League of Nations country, it will inevitably encounter many difficulties if it wants to attend the Permanent Mandates Commission and the Council to express its opinions. This is another point that we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>▲ What about the worst-case scenario? However, the situation in international politics changes with the times, and the worst-case scenario must also be foreseen. Since the League of Nations regards Japan as an enemy country, it must adopt the aforementioned active theory in legal interpretation, that is, it must deprive Japan of the mandate it has obtained. If the situation reaches this point, what will be the fate of the mandated territory of the South Seas Islands? If the League of Nations decides to deprive Japan of its mandate, to which country will it be granted? I believe that there are two countries with the possibility of being granted: first, Germany; second, the United States.</p>
<p>When the first League of Nations General Assembly was held in 1920, Germany sent a memorandum to the General Assembly, stating that when deciding on the distribution of the old German mandated territories, Germany also had the right to be considered. If these territories are completely merged into the main Allied and Associated Powers under the name of mandate, it is suspected of violating Article 22 of the Covenant. By 1926, Germany joined the League of Nations and obtained the status of a permanent member of the Council. Germany further put forward a strong argument, saying that Germany is a culturally advanced country and has the most appropriate qualifications for assuming the responsibilities of mandate, such as resource experience. Germany is the old master of the mandated territory and is now a permanent member of the League of Nations Council. Of course, it has the right to participate in the mandate and share a piece of the pie. Moreover, among the League of Nations countries, in order to make Germany forget the suffering of defeat and join the League of Nations with peace of mind, there are also those who advocate that it must be given a mandate. In summary, based on past situations, once the League of Nations deprives Japan of its mandate, it may turn around and grant it to Germany, which is not a baseless statement. However, the mandated territory was originally ceded by Germany to the main Allied and Associated Powers. Therefore, when Japan is deprived of this right, it will still be granted to the United States, one of the main Allied and Associated Powers. It cannot be said that no one will make this claim. Judging from the international political situation in the past, this possibility seems to be slightly smaller than that of Germany. However, if we take a broader view of the relationship between Japan and the United States in the Pacific, it cannot be concluded that the United States has no hope of obtaining the mandate over the South Seas Islands.</p>
<p>If the League of Nations deprives our country of the mandate over the South Seas Islands and transfers it to Germany or the United States, this is the worst-case scenario. At this time, can our country obey the decision of the League of Nations? I know that it is impossible. If our country disregards this decision of the League of Nations and continues to rule the South Seas Islands, what will be the result? At this time, the League of Nations will inevitably resort to the navy to drive Japanese forces out of the South Seas Islands.</p>
<p>However, is the League of Nations or the newly mandated Germany or the United States willing to bet on a naval battle to fight for the control of the South Seas Islands? I dare say that this is impossible. In the end, it will only be recorded in the minutes of the League of Nations meeting that the South Seas Islands are a mandated territory of Germany or the United States, but in reality, they will still be occupied by us and remain under our rule. At this time, the League of Nations will inevitably regard Japan as an illegal occupying country and regard it as a public enemy of the League of Nations and criticize it. The future will be unimaginable. This is another thing that must be prepared for. (End)</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Evening Post Vigorously Refutes Japan's Memorandum</h3>
<p>Japan is Forcing an Old Style as the Latest Fashion</p>
<p>The Nine-Power Treaty Does Not Limit China to Time</p>
<p>Cannot Govern Others Without Their Permission</p>
<p>Lincoln's Famous Saying Must Be Implemented in Manchuria and the World</p>
<p>Japan's memorandum is full of sophistry and absurdity. Various newspapers have already commented and refuted it, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also drafting a rebuttal. However, words from oneself may be regarded as subjective opinions. On the 20th, the Shanghai Evening Post published an article criticizing Japan for dressing up in 19th-century attire to show people, and claiming it to be the most fashionable new fashion. It also determined that Japan will eventually have to change its mind. The arguments are stern and just. The following is a translation of the original text:</p>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Agency translated the Shanghai Evening Post's commentary, saying that Japan's memorandum to the investigation team does not seem to have much new factual information. Even if there is, it is minimal. On the contrary, there is a large pile of repeated arguments. It is particularly evident that Japan cannot understand the new enlightenment of the modern thinking path of international events. Someone has repeatedly made remarks saying that Japan is an unfortunate country, permanently lagging behind and unable to catch up. Japan's extravagance is produced when the empire under the old meaning is becoming increasingly obsolete. Japan's efforts to defend its imperialist actions as reasonable are often based on precedents that have been invalidated by treaties and new international attitudes. Accordingly, Japan continues to work hard on things that have been done many years ago, and expresses anger at the criticism and genuine hostility caused by its actions based on modern concepts. Japan always wears a skirt with a padded bustle, a hat that is high in the front and low in the back, and displays a woman's new dress from 1856 to prove that what she is wearing is the latest outfit. There are several points in Japan's criticism that make people wonder. Did the person preparing Japan's reply actually carefully read the report? For example, there is a statement in it that the report's unfairness to Japan is discussed in a fragmented manner, and it cannot recognize a fundamental tenet, and make it smooth and integrated, that is, "there is a certain intention to eliminate Japan's rights in Manchuria." Speaking of the facts, the report thoroughly acknowledges the matter mentioned, but it is expressed in another sentence, "Implementing its, China's) national policy of restricting Japan's constant interests in Manchuria." This is the central point of disagreement between Lytton and Japan on Manchuria. The investigation team sees that "the national policy goals of China and Japan conflict with each other," and sees that they are those who enjoy "extraordinary interests" rather than those who enjoy "rights." And Japan's reply is based on the lofty basis that Japan is divinely endowed to reverse the chaos and restore order in an ownerless territory, nominally owned by a neighboring country that is completely unworthy of being called a "nation."</p>
<p>Looking at all the fundamental differences above, there will inevitably be three or four repetitions and top-heavy conflicts on every important point. The assumptions that the Japanese have from the beginning, that is, that the investigation team simply does not know what they are talking about, should be stopped and considered, and enter a more solid basis, that is, recognize that the investigation team does know it, but they are speaking from a completely different point of view from Japan. This point can be resolved immediately. Japan's criticism has returned to the Washington Conference, and it may not even be necessary to hold the same views as the investigation team. Japan now seems to be adopting a view of China that is very different from that of other signatory countries.</p>
<p>Japan claims to feel that all events have made the assumptions of 1922 deceived, and even conveyed the meaning that China's rapid progress should be a prerequisite for the treaty to continue to be effective. In fact, everyone can check the treaty to see that there is no such meaning in the text. The treaty orders the signatory countries to "respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity," and requires the countries to "give China the fullest and least difficult opportunity to develop and maintain an effective and stable government." There is no time limit on the progress of China's development. The progress of China's national development, if there are ups and downs, is like what individuals have. In the eyes of an unbiased bystander, it seems to be quite natural. And Japan is now using the fact that things in Manchuria do not meet its criteria to create reasons to prove that its entire process in Manchuria is reasonable.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are countless points of top-heavy conflict between this reply and the Lytton Report. Japan not only continues to insist that the emergence of "Manchukuo" is a natural and independent event, but also further declares, "Japan believes that the future of Manchukuo is bright and promising." Try to compare this with Lytton's view, Lytton said, "The independence movement was unheard of in Manchuria before September 1931, only because the Japanese army was in the field of action was a clear thing." Also, the Chinese banker and merchant quoted Lytton as saying, "We do not want to become Koreans."</p>
<p>It is not necessary to elaborate on these dead ends, just remember how accidental they are and how directly they hinder the fundamental concepts of the Japanese officials and the investigation team. Lincoln said many years ago, "I am sure that without the permission of the other party, no one can govern others." This view will take the world a lot of time to see its value. Japan is proof that there are still people who do not believe it. But this is a truth, and the civilized view will eventually be implemented in Manchuria, and it will be implemented everywhere in the world. Those who recognize this fact will be spared from changing their minds later, or will have to change their minds themselves.</p>
<h3>Chiang Inspects Northern Hubei and Returns to Hankou</h3>
<p>▲ Met with various generals in Fancheng to instruct on the situation</p>
<p>▲ Uncertain about the trip to Jiangxi, Zhu Shaoliang departs for inspection</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch. Commander-in-Chief Chiang, in order to understand the situation at the front lines due to the remnants of bandits Xu and He fleeing to Shaanxi and Henan, took his own Sikorsky plane from Hankou on the 17th to inspect northern Hubei. The original plan was to fly directly to Laohekou, but he temporarily changed to disembarking in Fancheng and temporarily stationed there. On the 18th, he toured Longzhong, paying homage to the former residence of Zhuge Wuhou. On the 19th, he was about to go to Laohekou. Coincidentally, senior generals He Chengjun, Liu Zhenhua, Wei Lihuang, etc. had all rushed to Fancheng to pay their respects and ask for instructions. Therefore, he stopped going north. On that day, Chiang met with He and others, inquired about the situation of bandit suppression at the front lines, and gave instructions. In general, he still instructed He to personally stationed in Laohekou to supervise the suppression. He commanded the various troops of Fan Shisheng, Xiao Zhichu, Liu Maoen, and Hu Zongnan to form a pursuit team to enter Shaanxi to pursue and suppress the bandits. Another division was sent from the pass to Shaanxi to assist the Shaanxi army, Sun Weiru and others, to intercept and suppress the bandits, and to clear them as scheduled. With the deployment completed, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, together with He, left Fancheng by car on the 20th to inspect the troops of the 83rd Division under Kan. He also summoned and lectured the officers and soldiers. At the same time, he telegraphed the Pinghan Railway Management Committee to send a car to Huayuan for use. The chairman of the committee, He Jingwu, prepared a special train at 4:00 a.m. on the 21st and personally led a team of road guards to Huayuan to wait. At 10:00 a.m. that morning, Chiang arrived at Huayuan by car and summoned the officers and soldiers of the Third Division for a lecture and inspected them. At 3:00 p.m., he boarded a special train and left Huayuan to return to Hankou. At 6:05 p.m., the train arrived at Dazhimen Station. Cao Haosen, Zhang Nanxian, Yang Yongtai, Chen Xizeng, Ye Peng, etc. were all waiting at the station. After Commander-in-Chief Chiang got off the train, he returned to the Yihai Village residence to rest. He Chengjun, Liu Zhenhua, Wei Lihuang, etc. returned to their respective defenses from Suixian and Fancheng. It was reported that Chiang's trip to Jiangxi was still uncertain, and there were rumors that he would stop going. If the Third Plenary Session is held in Nanjing, he will definitely go to attend. Zhu Shaoliang, the commander-in-chief of the border area of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, originally planned to go to Jiangxi with Chiang. However, because Chiang's trip was uncertain, he took a Xincaidian wheel from Hankou on the evening of the 21st. Zhu is going to inspect the Huangshigang, Yangxin, and Daye areas and review the bandit suppression troops in the border area of the three provinces. He will then transfer to Xianning and take a car to Hunan to review the 28th Army under Liu Jianxu. He will return to Hankou in about a week to start organizing the headquarters to supervise the suppression. (November 21)</p>
<h3>The Headquarters' Rural Financial Relief Office Established</h3>
<p>▲ Training Rural Cooperative Instructors</p>
<p>▲ The Banking Industry Lent 1 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch. The Bandit Suppression Headquarters of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces decided to establish a Rural Financial Relief Office and appointed Guo Waifeng as the director. Guo arrived in Hankou from Nanjing on the 16th. Due to Commander-in-Chief Chiang's urging, he organized and established the office in the Ningbo Guild Hall on the 21st. Guo immediately announced his assumption of office and appointed the office's staff, including Secretary Chen Guoquan, staff members Jin Xueteng, Cheng Weijia, Liu Ruxiang, Ling Jingshan, Wang Xianggui, Wei Junming, Yang Heqing, seven people, and several clerks and secretaries. Cheng Weijia was appointed as the director of the General Affairs Group, Liu Ruxiang as the director of the Guidance Group, Ling Jingshan as the director of the Audit Group, and Jin Xueteng as the assistant secretary. Before Chen Guoquan arrives, Jin Xueteng will temporarily act as the secretary. According to Guo, after I arrived in Hankou on the 16th, I was ordered by Commander-in-Chief Chiang to take office as soon as possible, because the areas with heavy bandit disasters urgently need to be rescued in order to recover. This time, the League of Nations agricultural experts went to central Hubei for inspection. When they came to Hankou, they talked about the fact that there were no耕牛 (oxen) within hundreds of miles in central Hubei, and there was also a lack of seeds. Many farmers used reed sheds to avoid the cold, which was extremely miserable. The establishment of this office is to assist the development of rural cooperatives, so that the rural economy can gradually recover. In terms of responsibilities, emphasis is placed on guidance and auditing. However, the disaster-stricken area in one province is very large, and the restoration of rural areas requires manpower and financial resources to advance at the same time to be effective. Now the headquarters has a rural cooperative instructor training center in Wuchang, which is organized by Wen Qun. The first batch of 50 students will graduate in a week and will soon set off to various places to work in the field. The office will first start a pilot rural cooperative in Hubei Province and then promote it to Henan and Anhui provinces. When the graduates of the training center set off, the guidance group of the office will also send people to guide them. As for the funding, Commander-in-Chief Chiang has telegraphed the provinces and cities to donate, and he thinks there will be good results soon. The headquarters will also find a way to lend 1 million yuan from the banking industry for the purpose of rescuing rural circulating capital. (October 21)</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Newspapers Suspended Publication for Three Days</h3>
<p>▲ Due to Interference by the Municipal Public Security Bureau in Records</p>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch. After Qiu Zhaochen, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, shot and killed Zheng Weixin, the representative of the petitioning delegation of the People's Association for Eliminating Inferiority, his mother, Zheng Lin, issued a crying appeal, accusing Qiu of indiscriminate killing of innocent young people and suppressing the patriotic movement, and requesting assistance from all sectors. Zheng was originally a teacher at Duqing Elementary School. Huang Zhanyun, the chairman of the school's board of directors, also submitted a report to the provincial government's Pacification Commissioner's Office, requesting a thorough investigation to maintain justice and protect human rights. The local newspapers held a joint meeting on the morning of the 16th and decided to unanimously publish Huang's original report. When Qiu Zhaochen heard the news, he sent people to the newspapers in the afternoon to request that they not be published, but he was rejected by the newspapers. At 12:00 p.m. that night, the Municipal Public Security Bureau suddenly dispatched many police officers to the Qiushi Newspaper Office, claiming that they were acting on the order of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. The newspaper's publication of the news that Zhang Yan's brigade was heading to Yanping had leaked military secrets and violated Article 21 of the Publishing Law. It should be punished by suspending publication for three days as a warning. The newspaper then complied with the order and suspended publication from the 17th. In order to express sympathy for the Qiushi Newspaper, the other newspapers convened a meeting in the afternoon and decided that, with the exception of the Min Guo Daily, which was run by the Provincial Party Department, they would also voluntarily suspend publication for three days from the 18th and issued a declaration, which read, "Our newspapers deeply feel that in the past ten days, we have had many concerns in terms of speech, and it is difficult to write truthfully about events in terms of records. Even the Qiushi Daily published certain news, which was mostly similar to what other newspapers in the city had published, but the newspaper alone was held responsible and ordered to suspend publication for three days. The punishment has no standard and is unfair. How can the newspapers feel safe? We have no choice but to voluntarily suspend publication for three days in order to promote a strong sense of reflection. We hereby announce this in the hope that you will understand." It was also agreed that after resuming publication, they would uniformly publish a notice on the newspaper, "Under orders, military news is not allowed to be published. We hope that readers will understand." However, on the afternoon of the 18th, the Public Security Bureau sent an inspection team to arrest Xia Yuchou, the editor-in-chief of the Chao Bao, and Lin Yipeng, the general manager of the Xiandai Daily. Fortunately, Xia and Lin heard the news and avoided it, so they were not arrested. It is now reported that the authorities are also dissatisfied with Qiu's actions in recent days. After the provincial government received Huang Zhanyun's complaint, it ordered Qiu Zhaochen to submit a report to the provincial government on the circumstances of the shooting and killing of Zheng Weixin on that day, along with the reactionary evidence obtained, for verification. The Pacification Commissioner's Office has considered withdrawing Qiu Zhaochen and requesting the provincial government to reappoint Tian Guozhang, the former commander of the 61st Division, as the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau.

<h3>Reasons for Economic Decline in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>▲Cheap Grain Hurts Farmers, Rural Areas Bankrupt</p>
<p>▲Foreign Goods Flood the Market, National Products Decline</p>
<p>▲Northeast Falls, Income Sharply Decreases</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This province has had a bumper grain harvest this year, the best in decades, but the economic decline and the people's hardship are also the worst in decades. The average middle-class farmer in rural areas is in danger of bankruptcy. Although the grain harvest is abundant, there are few buyers, the price is extremely low, and labor is very expensive, resulting in high expenses and low income. This has led to the phenomenon of cheap grain hurting farmers. After entering winter, prices of all goods have fallen, but sales are still sluggish, and the purchasing power of society is particularly weak. According to Director Wang Fangting of the Department of Industry, the phenomenon of cheap grain hurting farmers is widespread throughout the country this year. Examining the causes, they are none other than the three basic necessities of life: clothing, food, and shelter. Our people prefer to use foreign goods, and except for food, almost everything else is a market for foreign goods. For example, the Qingdao area is now full of American flour and Japanese coal. Shandong's only indigenous food product, wheat, and fuel such as Boshan coal, are also greatly affected. Other goods such as cotton yarn, ironware, lumber, and daily necessities are also all foreign goods. Countless amounts of money are flowing out to foreign countries like trickles of water, resulting in the current situation of poor people and exhausted wealth. The only way for the Department of Industry to remedy this is to promote the improvement of national products, increase production, and replace foreign goods as a fundamental plan. The current measures include: ㈠ Expanding spinning. The northwest region of this province is a major cotton-producing area. However, although the cotton produced is abundant, there are only two spinning mills, Lufeng in Jinan and Huaxin in Qingdao. A new company, Tongyi, has been organized in Jinan, but it has not yet started operations. A large amount of cotton is thus used by foreign yarn factories to absorb our country's money. Therefore, the spinning industry must be actively expanded. However, it is easy to celebrate success with the people, but difficult to plan the beginning with them. Relying solely on persuasion has little effect. It is decided that next year, each county will be forced to convene commercial and private shareholders to establish yarn factories. At least two should be established first. ㈡ Supporting enterprises. The industry in this province is still in its infancy. There are too few factories. The Department of Industry protects and supports enterprises, providing assistance and guidance to new ones, and assisting existing ones to develop, striving to prevent their closure. The department has also established a model pottery factory in Boshan. Since its establishment, it has produced many products, and Japanese porcelain has gradually decreased by 20-30%. ㈢ Cultivating timber. Although this province has many mountains, they are all barren and do not produce timber. All timber used is imported from the United States and the Northeast, and the amount of money flowing out is considerable. Now that the Northeast has fallen into Japanese hands, the Department of Industry is planning to expand afforestation and cultivate timber for future needs. However, it will take several years to see the benefits. ㈣ Promoting cotton planting and establishing cotton experimental farms to improve cotton production has been quite effective. According to surveys, the cotton production in this province this year is sufficient for the province's own use. ㈤ Civilian factories. The Department of Industry has been setting up civilian factories in various counties since last year to develop local industries and provide for the poor. Most of the 108 counties in the province have been established. Because cloth is most needed, weaving factories are the most numerous. In a few years, they may disappear from our market. ㈥ Rescuing the coal industry. Yixian Zhongxing on the Jinpu Railway, Zhangqiu, Zichuan, and Boshan on the Jiaoji Railway are the largest coal-producing areas in this province. In addition to supplying the province's own use, they can also be sold to Qingdao, Shanghai, Hankou, and other places. Boshan suffered a major flood this year, reducing production and increasing costs. Sales in Qingdao, Shanghai, and other places have also been seized by Japanese Fushun coal. Therefore, Yixian Zhongxing, with its larger capital, has suffered heavy losses, and the smaller coal mines in Boshan have closed down one after another. The Department of Industry is thus reducing coal surcharges on the one hand and planning to establish a Boshan power plant to supply electricity for mining, thereby reducing costs. The budget for the power plant requires 2.1 million yuan of capital, but after it is opened, it can earn 300,000 to 400,000 yuan per year. The shares are borne by the mine owners, and the benefits are shared. The cost of each mine will be reduced by a certain amount, and the price of coal will be lower, which should be able to compete with foreign coal, and so on.</p>
<p>According to a certain person in economic circles, although there are many reasons for the economic decline in Shandong this year, the fall of the Northeast is also the biggest reason. Many Shandong people go to the Northeast to cultivate every year. At the end of each year, they bring back the fruits of their year's hard work. The Jinpu and Jiaoji railways specially open small ticket cars for transportation. Postal remittances are also extremely busy. Although there are no statistics, it is probably no less than tens of millions of yuan. Last year, first there was the Wanbaoshan Incident, followed by the fall of the Northeast. Many Shandong people in Korea and the Northeast were expelled and returned. The postal service tried its best, but before the Northeast postal service was sealed, remittances from the Northeast had already disappeared. The Jinpu and Jiaoji railways only see refugees with emaciated faces, and no longer see Shandong people returning home with wealth. This is another major impact of the fall of the Northeast on Shandong province. (20th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Levies Labor to Build the Nanjing-Jiangxi Railway</h3>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>▲Bankruptcy Case of Songjiang Bank Opens for Trial. The bankruptcy case of Songjiang Bank, after the creditors formed a creditors' group and hired lawyers Qu Yue and Liu Zhimou to represent them in suing the bank's directors for responsible repayment, was heard by Judge Wang in court yesterday (21st) at 9:00 AM. The defendant directors Yan Shaxunyi and the special agent lawyer Tang Mingshi appeared in court. More than ten creditors, including Bo Guanlan, Wu Boyang, and Wang Muji, arrived. First, creditor Bo Guanlan stated that the case had been delayed for nine months and requested a swift judgment to protect the interests of the creditors. The creditors had come from afar to Songjiang, and the round trips had resulted in many losses. Then, Zhang Zuo, Liu Wu Boyang, and others made their requests in turn. The questioning continued until 12:00, but was not completed. The court continued to open at 2:00 PM. As a result of the dispute, because the director Zhang Sansheng had died and his property was not being managed, they requested a provisional attachment. Lawyer Sha argued that the person who would inherit from Zhang Sansheng, one of the directors, had not yet been determined. The so-called provisional attachment should first have the procedures corrected before the debate could begin. Then, Lawyer Qu delivered an eloquent argument, arguing that waiting until the seventh day after the funeral would still leave sixty days, and the third anniversary period. If another director also had the same situation, waiting in turn would mean that the creditors would never have hope of repayment. He requested that the debate be opened immediately and that the procedures be corrected afterwards. Lawyer Sha still opposed this. The judge ordered that the plaintiff correct the procedures before reopening the debate for review and approval.</p>
<p>▲The Truth About the Murder Case in the City. Last night, a case occurred in which two thugs stabbed Ni Shouchu's family in Hechi Lane. Ni Shouchu's wife and mother-in-law were sent to Songjiang Hospital for treatment. It is said that they are not in danger of death. Yesterday, a person who had rented a house came to the Ni family at around 2:00 PM, using the excuse of looking at the house. Among the two thugs who unsuccessfully attempted to rob and then suddenly inflicted knife wounds in the evening, one was the person who had looked at the house that day. His face was recognized by Ni's wife. It is said that he claimed to work for a certain organization. The case has not yet been solved, and the public security authorities are strictly arresting the perpetrators.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>▲Red Pill Organization Cracked Outside Changmen. The third branch of the Wuxian Public Security Bureau received a report that someone had established a red pill organization at No. 51 Nanhau Street outside Changmen. A police officer was dispatched to search the premises and seized twenty bags of red pills, three catties and ten taels of white powder, three packages of heroin, and opium, as well as a resident woman, Ren Xia. She was immediately taken to the branch bureau and transferred to the public security bureau for questioning.</p>
<p>▲Autumn Tax Assessment Approved. The Wuxian autumn tax assessment was decided by the county to convene a meeting of property owners to submit a case to the province at 85%. After the provincial office sent personnel to review the assessment, the assessment was increased by two li to 87% for submission to the province. After receiving the telegram, the provincial office, because gentlemen of Wuxian had requested that the excess revenue from this year's autumn tax exceeding 72% be fully used to offset local subsidies and shorten the requisition period, which was approved on record, decided to approve the assessment at 89 li. The office urgently telegraphed the county government to notify them.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>▲Ancient Tomb Discovered at Murder Bridge. The tomb area near Murder Bridge, about three miles east of Nanqiao, was originally extremely desolate. Recently, farmers Wang Si, Li Shubing, and others were digging mud there to build a levee. When they dug about a foot below ground, they suddenly saw a stone slab. They gathered many people to remove the stone slab, and below it was a brick tomb. The surrounding wall feet were made of lime and glutinous rice flour, which was extremely hard. The inner and outer coffins inside the tomb had already decayed, but the two coffins were still intact and as new. When the coffin lids were opened, there were male and female corpses inside. The man wore a gauze hat with two wings on the side, a long-sleeved robe, and square-toed black boots. A round bronze mirror, as large as a bowl with bird-like patterns, was placed on his chest. The woman's upper body clothes were scattered and incomplete, but she still had a red skirt on her lower body. A square box containing four items such as wooden combs was placed next to her head, and they were not damp. Her pillow, which looked like a block of wood, was extremely soft, about three inches long and one foot wide, concave in the middle and convex on the outside, which was quite strange. The style of the two coffins was rectangular and made of four single-width boards nailed together, sounding like a bell when knocked. Those who knew recognized them as nanmu wood, worth ten thousand gold. However, there were no inscriptions in the tomb to verify the time, but judging from the clothes, they were probably figures from the Yuan or Ming dynasties. After learning about this, the township chief Liu Maoxing immediately reported it to the district office. The public security bureau sent Inspector Chen Jinfang to inspect the site yesterday, and it was confirmed to be true. At the same time, two empty coffins were found in Wang Si's house, so the official, in addition to notifying the township chief to temporarily guard the site, reported back to the bureau and district today to await further investigation.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>▲Former Director of the Kunshan Construction Bureau Escorted to the Province for Interrogation. Wu Junyu, the former director of the Kunshan County Construction Bureau, embezzled more than 20,000 yuan in mu donations. After being reported by the county party headquarters, the county government arrested Wu, interrogated him, and imprisoned him for half a year. He has not yet been sentenced. Now the county government has received an order from the province to escort Wu to the province for interrogation. After receiving the order, County Chief Cheng dispatched police captain Luo Yanxiang yesterday morning to escort Wu by early train to the provincial office to await interrogation.</p>
<p>▲Strange Fetus. Zhang Xingsheng, a tailor who lived outside the West Gate, had a wife who had been pregnant for more than a year and had a large belly. The other day, she suddenly felt abdominal pain and was about to give birth. Xingsheng hurriedly called a midwife to his home to deliver the baby. By noon yesterday, two days and nights had passed, but the fetus had not yet been born. Zhang urgently invited Dr. Wang from Kunshan Hospital to use surgery to try to remove the fetus, but it had already died. Dr. Wang carefully examined the fetus and found it to be quite peculiar. The head was pointed like an olive, the genitals were born under the forehead, it had one eye on its face, no nose, a mouth as small as a yellow bean, and six fingers and toes on each hand and foot. Dr. Wang took it away as a specimen. When people heard about it, those who went to Kunshan Hospital to see it blocked the door. This is specially recorded for the study of physiologists.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲Three Robbery Cases on Land and Water in One Night. Robbery cases are frequently heard during the winter prevention period, and the future of public security is particularly worrying. Tongyang Bridge outside the South Gate is lined with shops and is very prosperous. There is a public stove, and the owner is Chen Ada, who hires a group of friends to manage everything. Chen pulls a rickshaw for Qian Fenghao, the owner of the Dingchang Silk Factory. Opposite the public stove is the newly built school building of Xizhong Middle School, and both sides are workshops of the Dingchang Silk Factory. On the night before yesterday (21st) at around 7:00 PM, four robbers wearing black clothes and blue pants suddenly came to Chen Ada's public stove, holding weapons such as pistols and flashlights. They poured in and first grabbed Chen's wife, forbidding her from making a sound. One robber immediately forced Chen's wife to take off her gold ring and gold bracelet. The remaining robbers entered the room and searched it arbitrarily. After more than ten minutes, they roared out. After the robbers left the public stove, they reunited with several robbers who had been lying in ambush and broke into the nearby workshop at No. 35, robbing the home of Che Gushengfu, the chief manager of the Dingchang Silk Factory. At that time, Gu's wife and three or four young sisters were chatting and laughing in the room. After the robbers entered, they immediately took out guns and forbade them from making a sound, ordering them to take off the gold rings on their hands. Gu's wife and others had no choice but to let them rob them. They escaped with their loot at around 11:00 PM, and fired three shots as a show of force before leaving. Also, the Xichang night boat, fully loaded with goods, left Xichang at around 7:00 PM on the afternoon of the same day. The boat crew was pulling the boat along the shore, but when they passed near Gaoqiao, they suddenly encountered eight or nine robbers who rushed out of the mulberry fields, holding box cannons. They first grabbed the boat crew who were pulling the boat, ordered them to stop the boat, and then rushed onto the boat to search and rob at will. After about half an hour, they escaped with their loot. It is estimated that the goods robbed were worth more than 700 yuan.</p>
<p>▲Robbers Who Robbed the Train in Danyang Escorted to Wuxi. On the afternoon before yesterday at around 4:00 PM, when the express train going down from Beijing to Shanghai left Danyang Station, two bandits carrying pistols suddenly jumped onto the train from the front of the platform, intending to rob it. They were spotted by ticket inspector Zhang Yuanlong, who reported it to the military police on the train. They went to capture them, and as a result, one robber was captured. Yesterday, he was escorted to Wuxi and sent to the headquarters of the Fifth Regiment stationed in Wuxi for questioning. The robber confessed that his name was He Diao, 22 years old, from Hunan. After hearing his confession, Commander Zhang temporarily sent him to prison, or will send him to the Military Police Command for questioning. Also, Chen Fugen, a robber involved in the abduction and robbery case at the Hua Jiugao family at Sifang Bridge in the eighth district of the county, was escorted back to Wuxi from Shanghai yesterday by Qian Tianxiong, captain of the county water patrol team, with a document, and transferred to the county government for questioning and imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>▲Armed Bandits Colluding with Salt Smugglers Arrested. Yu Shiquan, the police captain stationed in Baizhang, Wuyi County, received a report on the 20th at 4:00 PM that the armed bandit Feng Abao was colluding with salt smugglers to plot mischief at Liujia Lane. He immediately dispatched a team to investigate and arrest them. They found Chen Xiaolin, Liu Jixu, Liu Defeng, Chen Sanda, Wang Heshang, Chen Baohai, and other six people, as well as six salt carts, at Liujia Lane. The armed bandit Feng Abao escaped. The witnesses were escorted to the brigade headquarters. On the 21st, the prisoners were taken away by the sixth district of the tax police of the Ministry of Finance for questioning.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>▲County Government Interrogates the Sandbar Bandit Case. Feng Ziyun, a notorious bandit from Jiangbei, sneaked into Liuhai Sandbar, using the alias Jiang Zeren. With huge sums of money, he organized a land protection project, secretly recruiting followers, making uniforms, and purchasing firearms. After being detected by the county government, he was captured. Feng and Dong Jiqian, who was involved, were sent to the county government. The interrogation of the case was clear on the 21st, and the case was submitted to the province for approval.</p>
<p>▲Dispute Over a Ball Game at the Sports Field. The agricultural science department and the textile science department of Nantong College competed in soccer at the public sports field on the afternoon of the 20th. The linesman had a disagreement with Liu Baozhu, a student from Nantong Middle School who was watching the game, over crossing the boundary. Liu was injured, causing a dispute. Nantong Middle School students went to the agricultural science department to negotiate, and another conflict arose. The matter will now be prosecuted in court.</p>
<p>▲Bandits Captured in Rugao Escorted to Nantong. The provincial security regiment arrested the notorious bandit Chen Desan in Rugao and escorted him to the regiment headquarters in Nantong for interrogation.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>▲The Truth About the Murder of Her Husband Case Has Come to Light. He Yunlin, a native of Baisha, Dongwai, lived at the home of Dai Aliu in Chenjia Village, Nanwai. After his sudden death on the night of the 11th, his mother and brother sued the county government and opened the coffin for examination, which confirmed that he had died from poisoning before his death. Subsequently, Investigator Wang Cheng interrogated the case several times and personally went to Dai Aliu's home in Chenjia Village to search for evidence, finding two empty medicine bottles and a pay slip for Jiang Fangrui, a first-class soldier in the fourth battalion of the first regiment of the provincial security force (that is, the old Jiang, He's wife's lover), which was returned and filed. On the 20th, Dai Aliu and a ten-year-old girl, Xu Bao, were summoned and questioned in the inner room, and He's wife, Chen, and others were brought in for confrontation. According to their confessions, Lao Jiang often went to He's house. On the night of the 11th, my mother and I were in the He's room. Lao Jiang urged us to go home and sleep quickly. At midnight, we suddenly heard Yunlin shouting "Oh yo!" We got up and peeked, and saw Guan Shilang pressing on Yunlin's feet, Chen pressing on both hands, and Lao Jiang stabbing his head with a knife and pouring yellow happy water. My mother and I entered the room, and Lao Jiang was frightened and ran away. Afterwards, Chen told me not to make a sound, etc. The interrogator ordered Chen and others to cross-examine, but they still refused to tell the truth. They were ordered to be returned to prison, and Xu Bao was ordered to be dismissed.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>▲Director Xu Pays Attention to the West Bank of the Canal. It is reported that the stone work on the west bank of the Jiangbei Canal project in Jianggao is still not completed today. The stone work requires more than 400,000 yuan, and the existing materials and the funds promised by the provincial government only amount to more than 100,000 yuan, which is insufficient. Another 300,000 yuan is still needed. Director Xu of the Engineering Bureau believes that the west bank is the barrier of the east bank. If the stone work on the west bank is not repaired during this dry season when the water is low, it is difficult to guarantee that the newly built east bank will not be in danger when the canal water rises next year. Therefore, he has again sent a letter to Committee Member Shi Liangcai and Committee Member Zhang Gongquan of the National Economic Commission, asking them to appeal to the Ministry of Finance on his behalf.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>▲The County Government Executes Bandit Leaders. The bandit leader Lu Chaolin gathered a crowd to rob the homes of Yan Dabo and others in Yanjia Village outside the East Gate and shot and killed Yan Fucheng, the owner of the house. He was captured by detectives from the county government. His confession was cunning and evasive. Huang Kaifu, a bandit in the same case, and Jiang Jinsan, a bandit who had already been executed, testified that Lu Chaolin was indeed the main culprit in shooting and killing the owner of the house. After receiving the confession, the county government immediately telegraphed the province for instructions. A telegram was received approving the death penalty. The prisoner was taken out at 11:00 AM yesterday, his identity was verified, he was tied up and taken to the execution ground to be shot.</p>
<p>▲A Large Number of Cattle Being Illegally Transported Were Captured. A number of soldiers and police from the Lücheng Security Corps intercepted more than 520 cattle transported from Danyang Station to Shanghai at Lücheng Station yesterday. At that time, the county party headquarters of this county received this information and sent a letter to the county government public security bureau, requesting that they be detained immediately and urgently telegraphed to the province for instructions on how to dispose of them.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>▲Bandits Block the Road and Rob. Wu Fuqing, a villager from Xiaochenzi, Hulü Northwest Township, was returning home from Hengshan Bridge on the 20th of this month. When he passed a small bridge, he suddenly encountered two bandits speaking with a Hakka accent who stopped Wu and claimed to be searching for opium. At that time, Wu saw that the bandits had pistols and did not dare to make a sound, so he let the bandits search him. Wu Fuqing had 31 silver dollars and 48 small silver coins that he had obtained from Hengshan Bridge, all of which were robbed by the bandits.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>▲A Foreign Goods Broker Commits Suicide by Poison. Liu Jiqing, a 24-year-old native of Yin County, lived in Yiweifang outside the West Gate. He was a broker for the Huacheng Foreign Goods Company in Shanghai. He was fired for some reason at the beginning of this month. He returned from Shanghai the other day and stayed at room No. 6 of the Putian Chun Society Inn at the railway station, paying two silver dollars. He went out immediately. He did not return until late at night. Inexplicably, at 10:00 AM yesterday, the waiter entered the room and saw Liu lying on the bed, his face pale and his limbs cold, but he was still barely breathing. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment immediately. Because he had taken too much poison, there were fears for his life.</p>
<p>▲The Bureau Chief Was Detained for Arresting Flower Societies. Flower societies have been prevalent recently in Luojiazhuang near Shuiyinpu in Pu Township, the seventh district of Yuyao. At around 4:00 AM the other day, Yu Renqian, the director of the Henghe Seventh Branch of the public security bureau in the district, led police officers to arrest them. Unexpectedly, the flower society perpetrators gathered a crowd to resist arrest and confiscated all the police's firearms. Director Yu was also detained and beaten in many places. The county bureau, upon receiving the report, has sent personnel to investigate.</p>
<p>▲Attempted Escape by Setting Fire, Fell and Drowned. Chen Yueying, the wife of Zhang Amao of Chen Zhangfang, Tianyuan Temple, Yuyao, was just over 20 years old and had only been married in March of last year. Because of discord between husband and wife, she had repeatedly tried to escape but had not succeeded. Therefore, she was very depressed. Inexplicably, at around 7:00 PM the other day, during the Zhang family's dinner, Yueying again wrapped up her clothes and escaped from the back door, and set fire to the house. When the villagers saw the fire, they sounded the alarm. Yueying was guilty and panicked, and ran wildly, causing her to fall into the river and drown.</p>
<h3>Taixian</h3>
<p>▲The County Magistrate Urges All Districts to Rush to Handle Grain Storage. The county government has submitted the grain storage issue to the county political meeting for serious discussion. Following the example of Jintan County, one catty of rice is collected per mu, with the landlord and tenant each bearing half. All districts must actively organize in accordance with the law. However, many days have passed and no reports have been submitted. It is learned that the county government has again sent a telegram urging them to rush to handle the matter and submit reports as soon as possible, in order to achieve it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Education News Highlights</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Duan Talks About the Normal University Not Being Reorganized</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd Telegram. Vice Minister of Education Duan Xipeng talked about the reorganization of the Normal University, stating that the Ministry has not made any decisions. During July, Minister Zhu said that some people have recently advocated that the Normal University should only admit graduates of normal schools who are determined to become secondary school teachers to study for one year. Some people in the Ministry also advocated that the current system should be maintained, and that its courses and organization should all be suitable for the purpose of training teachers. It seems that rumors about the reorganization of the Normal University have arisen because of this. The Ministry believes that this issue is important and must be carefully studied. Therefore, there has never been any decision. What is the so-called cancellation? If the current system of the Normal University really needs reform, it cannot be cancelled simply because of disagreement from any party. In short, the current urgent task of the Normal University is to seriously reorganize the current situation and strive to make the curriculum and equipment suitable for the purpose of training secondary school teachers, so as to live up to the name of the Normal University. The rectification of the school's academic atmosphere is a matter that cannot be ignored. Those who truly love the Normal University should devote themselves to this.</p>

<p>Fourth, Teaching Key Points</p>
<p>1.  Hygiene education should start with practical problems; practice is more important than knowledge.  2.  Teachers should strive to integrate hygiene knowledge with the practical environment during teaching, fully adopt the spirit of project-based teaching, and increase connections with other subjects and extracurricular activities for children.  3.  Teachers should lead by example during teaching and personally participate in practical work related to hygiene.  4.  Teachers must actively inspect children's hygiene practices, regularly examine various hygiene habits and skills, and conduct daily cleanliness checks for children in lower grades at any time. Various assessments and inspections should be recorded with symbols or scores, and the results should be statistically analyzed to promote interest in practice through competition.  5.  Schools should, within their means, fully provide various equipment related to hygiene to enable children to use them at any time and create a hygienic environment.  6.  Schools should, within their means, designate a room as the office for all school hygiene facilities.  7.  Schools should, within their means, invite local health officials or parents enthusiastic about hygiene education to form a school health education design committee to lead the promotion of health education.  8.  Schools should, within their means, independently or jointly with nearby schools, hire doctors and nurses to oversee school health matters.  9.  Various hygiene groups, such as cleanliness inspection teams, nursing teams, and small hospitals, should be organized within children's activity groups for practice.  10. Implementing hygiene education requires full communication with families for effective results; otherwise, there will be many difficulties in progress. Therefore, during home visits or parent-teacher conferences, information about hygiene facilities should be discussed, or parents should be guided to visit children's hygiene self-governance organizations and school hygiene equipment. 11. In addition to daily hygiene inspections and monthly height and weight measurements, a general hygiene inspection or hygiene competition must be held regularly each academic year, and the results should be distributed and reported to families. 12. A hygiene education assessment must be conducted at the end of each semester to examine the progress of school hygiene education for comparison and improvement. 13. Children must be fully involved in various social hygiene gatherings in the community, such as cleaning and fly-swatting teams. 14. Children must practically investigate or visit various public health and public safety facilities or organizations in the community to cultivate their interest in public health and public safety.</p>

Comparing this to the number of Western children and the allocation of educational funding within the Concession, the Municipal Council should allocate 20% of the annual revenue to expand Chinese educational funding. This is merely a demand based on a comparative limit and a right that Chinese in the Concession should have. Our association deeply sympathizes with this proposal. We have prepared this letter accordingly, and we hope that you gentlemen will argue with the French Concession authorities based on reason and strive to achieve the above-mentioned objectives, so as to expand Chinese education within the Concession and enhance public relations."</p>
<h3>Declaration by the Education Association of the Second District of This City Demanding the Development of Chinese Education</h3>
<p>The Education Association of the Second District of this city believes that the French Concession authorities do not pay enough attention to Chinese education and that Western children receive far better treatment. Therefore, a declaration was issued, requesting Chinese Directors to suggest to the French Municipal Council that Chinese and Western children receive equal treatment. The original text is recorded below: "Since Shanghai opened as a port and the French established a concession, the disparity between Chinese and Western taxpayers has been significant. Chinese taxpayers contribute more than two-thirds of the revenue, but the treatment they receive is far less than that of Westerners, especially in the field of education within the Concession. Comparing the annual per capita educational expenditure of Western and Chinese children within the Concession will immediately reveal the disparity in treatment by the French Municipal Council. According to recent statistics from the French Municipal Council, there are a total of 125,700 Chinese children within the Concession, while the annual educational expenditure is only 88,200 taels. The per capita educational expenditure for Chinese children is only 7 jiao and 1 fen. There are only 2,737 Western children within the Concession, but the annual educational expenditure is as high as 130,000 taels. The per capita educational expenditure for Western children is 44 taels. Based on the above statistics, the French Municipal Council's neglect of Chinese education is evident. To develop Chinese education within the Concession, we must urge the French Municipal Council to reflect and improve or promote Chinese schools, or subsidize private schools within the Concession. At the same time, we should request Chinese Directors to make every effort to suggest to the French Municipal Council that Chinese and Western children receive equal treatment. Only then will the relationship between China and France be harmonious. We hereby declare."</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Huang Ke Gymnasium</h3>
<p>In recent years, China's sports development has advanced by leaps and bounds. This is indeed a good sign for the future of Chinese sports. The Kearney Physical Education School at 11 Seymour Road, founded by Kearney, has a history of over ten years since the Republic year 10. However, Chinese individuals aspiring to engage in sports have had no means to do so. Currently, Dr. Huang Miao, the principal of Zhengfeng Middle School, recognizing this, consulted with Kearney and obtained his consent to convert the Kearney Physical Education School into a Chinese-run institution, renamed the Huang Ke Gymnasium, with Huang serving as the director. Kearney will serve as the director of the Western sports department.</p>
<h3>Xia Guang Basketball Team Suffers a Narrow Defeat Last Night</h3>
<p>▲ Lost to McLain by Two Points in the Last Minute</p>
<p>▲ Final Score: 33 to 31</p>
<p>John Wins Over Nan Xing</p>
<p>No Games Tonight</p>
<p>Last night in the Western Youth Basketball League, Xia Guang suffered a narrow defeat to McLain by two points in the last minute. The final score was 33 to 31. The tension in the air was unprecedented since the beginning of the season. In another match, John defeated Nan Xing 37 to 32, which was less exciting. Tonight there will be women's basketball games, and the men will have a day of rest.</p>
<p>▲ Xia Guang's Loss Was a Pity</p>
<p>▲ Xia Guang's Momentum</p>
<p>Xia Guang came onto the court with great momentum, leading 4-2 and then 8-2. Chen Baoqiu's successful free throw made it 9-2, giving them a significant advantage and creating the impression that they would sweep McLain. However, in an instant, due to slightly lax defense, McLain seized the opportunity to counterattack with successive advances. McLain scored 11 points, taking the lead at 13-9. McLain then won the first half with a score of 15-11.</p>
<p>▲ Ups and Downs</p>
<p>Xia Guang, initially with the advantage, was chased by McLain. The offense and defense became more rigorous than before, and the match became closer and more intense. Despite the efforts of Ren and Wei, they only managed to catch up to 16-15. They then made it 18-17, taking a one-point lead. However, McLain responded with 19-18 and 21-20, regaining a one-point lead. The ebb and flow were endless, making it difficult to predict, and the excitement increased accordingly.</p>
<p>▲ Exciting Finale</p>
<p>Xia Guang was only one point behind, but then Monaghan scored consecutively, and McLain extended their lead to 27-22, creating a five-point gap. This sparked a thrilling comeback. Guan Dang'an's long-range shot and Ren Jiexing's success allowed Xia Guang to display excellent teamwork, tying the score again at 27-27. As the end of the game approached, the atmosphere became extremely tense.</p>
<p>▲ Final Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>After 27-27, McLain regained the lead with 29-27 and then 31-29, each time leading by only two points. Chen Baoqiu then made a sudden basket, tying the score again at 31-31. However, in the final tens of seconds, Byeshpol's shot led to Xia Guang's crushing defeat.</p>
<p>▲ Reasons for the Setback</p>
<p>Xia Guang had more opportunities than McLain last night, and McLain missed many inaccurate shots. Xia Guang had a great chance of winning, but their fatal flaw was their stagnation after taking a 9-2 lead in the first half, with lax defense and slow movements, allowing McLain to overtake them and score over ten points consecutively. Although they tried hard in the second half, it was too late. Chen Baoqiu's subpar performance was also a reason for their failure to win.</p>

<p>▲ John Defeats Nan Xing</p>
<p>John made their debut last night, defeating Nan Xing 37-32. They led from beginning to end. Although Nan Xing tried their best to catch up, they were ultimately unsuccessful. Cheng Jingxing has improved compared to before, and his shots were very accurate. The Wu brothers' defense was still good, but their movements seemed less agile. The pace of the match was very slow, and John's strength may not be as good as before.</p>

<h3>The Surprisingly Good Qunqun Volleyball Team</h3>
<p>▲ Today at 4 PM: Maiden Match Against Soochow University</p>
<p>Guangdong volleyball has always been the best in the country, and almost all representatives to the Far Eastern Games in the past have been from Guangdong. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that Guangdong is the origin of volleyball. Now, the Qunqun Society students from Peizheng Middle School in Guangzhou, who have recently arrived in Shanghai, deeply feel that volleyball in Shanghai is inactive. In order to promote this sport, they have organized a volleyball team with their friends in Shanghai to play friendly matches with various military and business groups. The team members include prominent players from Soochow University and Fudan University, such as Mo Jinliu, Wang Jiajun, Li Bifu, Huang Shaojie, Zhou Jieming, and Chen Bocai, all of whom are skilled in this sport. Today is their maiden match against Soochow University. The location is the Soochow University volleyball court in Yangshupu. Fans, don't miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3>News from the First Municipal Industrial and Commercial Football Association</h3>
<p>The fourth industrial and commercial amateur football competition at the First Municipal Sports Field will allow teams with at least eleven players who participated last year to register, preserving the qualifications of veteran members to continue competing, as previously reported. It is now learned that the registration for the association has closed. The list of teams that have applied to continue as veteran members includes the Postal Workers, Baohua, Central, Puyi, Qiuxin, Jianguang, Zuzhu, Xin Xin, Mian Guang, Northeast, Hui Guang, Lianyi, Hua Zhan, Pu Song, Chen Guang, Qiang Nan, Asia, Xin Yi Shao Guang, Shi Gong, Ling Nan, Gao Qiao, Meiya, Xin Xin, Guanghu, Zhi Yong, You Ning, Zhi Hua, and Dong Hua, Yang Zhi teams. However, after verifying the registration lists from last year, it was found that the Guanghu, Zhi Yong, You Ning, Zhi Hua, Dong Hua, and Yang Zhi teams did not have at least eleven veteran members, rendering their applications invalid according to regulations. Other teams, such as Xudong, Hongmao, Hunan, Huzhi, Shi Tu, Ye Shi, and Qingyun, with fewer veteran members than required, have strongly requested to continue participating. The association has granted them permission to re-register and join the competition from today until the 31st of November. Late registrations will not be accepted. Also, if the communication address of a registered team has changed, it must be notified in writing before the 31st.</p>

<h3>New Basketball Techniques (3)(4) (Not to be Reprinted) Original by Mlaire Burcky, Translated by Zhang Guoxun and Qian Yiqin</h3>
<p>Russell (Pug) Daughyity, former star of the Enos football and basketball teams, and now the basketball coach at Rice Institution, often uses this strategy to surprise and win after the jump ball, when the opponent's lineup is not yet complete. However, it must be noted that the center of our team must be able to jump over the opponent's center for this strategy to be effective.</p>
<p>Center #3 taps the ball to #4, who crosses the court behind the opponent's center. At this time, #4 should not hesitate and immediately pass the ball back to #3, who has retreated from the center circle. At the same time, #2 quickly sprints down from the right sideline. #3 immediately passes the ball long to #2. #1 also crosses the court to the basket to anticipate the pass from #2, or to rebound and put the ball in if #2 misses the shot.</p>

<p>One or Two Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>My Baldness</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>There are different types of hair: sandy hair and cottony hair. Sandy hair is close to hardening, while cottony hair is close to softening. In youth, there are no significant differences between sandy hair and cottony hair. But after middle age, sandy hair is more likely to turn white but less likely to become bald, while cottony hair is more likely to become bald but less likely to turn white. This is a marvel of nature, "compensating the essence with fat," "one mantis shrimp matches one shrimp," ensuring that neither suffers a loss and each has its advantages and disadvantages. I belong to the cottony hair type. I only just reached middle age, and the frontline of my hair has been unable to maintain its original state, with some lines wavering. Now, needless to say, lines of defense are retreating one by one, already retreating to the third line of defense! However, even though the lines of defense are retreating, no white flag has been raised. This is a characteristic of cottony hair and something to be proud of.</p>
<p>Patting my head, although not completely bald, the character "xiu" (秀, elegant) in "xiucai" (秀才, scholar), with its curved tail, cannot escape the character for baldness ("tu" 秃). Speaking plainly about baldness, let me tell two bald stories for amusement:</p>
<p>Ji Zisun, a senior official of the state of Lu in the Spring and Autumn period, was bald. He, along with Qu Ke, a lame official of the state of Jin, Gongzi Shou, a hunchbacked prince of the state of Cao, and Sun Liangfu, a one-eyed minister of the state of Wei, were all sent to Qi as envoys. The Duke of Qi also chose bald, lame, hunchbacked, and one-eyed people to serve as their drivers, which greatly angered the guests, leading to a fierce battle. I believe that lameness, hunchback, and blindness are disabilities. It is understandable that the envoys of Jin, Cao, and Wei were angry. Baldness is a stage that older people inevitably go through. Ji Zisun's anger is truly unjustifiable.</p>
<p>If it were a foreign bald person, they would wish to have other bald people as their companions. The recent bald convention has already become a popular tale. Let's set that aside for now. In the past, there was a Duke in Bulgaria who, after losing his hair due to illness and becoming bald, had over five hundred nobles shave their heads, revealing their shiny tops, to become his bald comrades. The Duke happily associated with them, pleased that he was not alone in his baldness. This Duke's tolerance was different from Ji Zisun of Lu. Ji Zisun was already angered by a bald driver. If these five hundred bald men had surrounded him, his bald head would probably have burst into flames! Haha!</p>
<h3>China Through American Eyes</h3>
<p>— Xu Bo'an</p>
<p>丨China Is No Worse Than America丨</p>
<p>I once heard Mr. Muegen, an American professor at Zhijiang University, say these words. "You shouldn't think that China is already beyond repair and idealize our American nation and society as excellent and perfect. This prejudice is probably influenced by Dr. Hu Shih's propaganda. Based on my observations, I don't think China is any worse than America. For example, private opium trafficking is rampant in China, but American private alcohol smuggling is comparable. For example, there are many kidnapping cases in Shanghai, sometimes as many as five or six a day, but in bustling American cities like New York and Chicago, there are sometimes over seventy cases in one night! And wasn't aviator Lindbergh's son kidnapped last semester? In fact, the increase in crime and the progress of civilization are racing forward at the same rate. American material civilization is higher than China's, so the degree of crime is also higher than China's, that is without a doubt. The only difference is that American capitalists and their kept politicians are better at organizing and using their skills to cover up many ugly things in the lowest layers of society, while painting a dazzling layer of gold on the upper layers. Thus, shallow-minded people praise the gold, forgetting the evil beneath it. In contrast, the situation in China is different. The upper layers are ugly, but the lower layers are no more ugly than that. Indeed,"</p>
<h3>Big Dishes and Flatbread</h3>
<p>— Wan Cheng</p>
<p>Eating big dishes represents the aristocratic class, and eating flatbread represents the poor class. Why do both "big dishes" and "flatbread" use the character "big" (大)? It actually contains philosophical meaning.</p>
<p>Our theory is that eating big dishes is definitely happier than eating flatbread!</p>
<p>In fact, let's look at rickshaw pullers, after toiling like animals, when their stomachs are rumbling and they desperately need food, holding a flatbread and chewing it. They seem to feel immense pleasure in their nerves, and their stomachs urgently need it. Although they are eating flatbread, its flavor is endless! It surpasses the taste of the big dishes eaten by aristocrats!</p>
<p>Conversely, think about the delicacies and banquets that aristocrats eat every day. But they are probably not as flavorful as the flatbread eaten by the poor.</p>
<p>Therefore, "flatbread" is also called "big." Although the item is cheap, the poor get it and are also "greatly" pleased with their meal. All worldly matters should be viewed in this way.</p>
<h3>The Chinese and Gambling</h3>
<p>— Qingke</p>
<p>From childhood, when they bought candy with a few copper coins, they were already infected with gambling and received gambling training. Entertainment and games, of all kinds, contain elements of gambling to some extent and are inseparable from gambling.</p>
<p>As for gambling with money, gambling with wives, and gambling with lives, that is simply competing to win or lose, it is a dog-eat-dog struggle. "Life is originally a gamble." Chinese people have such a passionate "fighting" view of life, which is remarkable.</p>
<p>Life should be about getting rich. And getting rich depends 70% on luck and 30% on effort. Chinese people are most superstitious about fatalism, which can be seen in gambling. But gambling itself is just blind luck, an accidental opportunity, so their philosophy is a completely muddled and random view of history. It's best to win at gambling, but it's okay to lose a little. They understand that "neither winning nor losing" is boring, neither good nor bad, what's the point? How do you explain luck?</p>
<p>Therefore, gambling needs a bit of boldness. But gambling also needs a lot of greed and a chance mentality. Chinese people are easily enticed by profit. It also needs small cleverness, cunning, deception, etc. Also, it needs a risk-taking attitude. We know that the "gambling spirit" of Guangdong people and other "Southern Barbarians" is famous. They are quick-witted, decisive, and have a genius for risk-taking. Even the signs of restaurants are written with terms like "zhong fa bai," "qing yi se," "da san yuan," and other such words. You can guess that their mahjong skills must be top-notch. Just imagine, at the moment of the so-called "all-in," what courage and spirit! How many of the shy, cowardly, and not-so-bold Jiangnan people have this?</p>
<h3>Crossroads of Death (22)</h3>
<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>"Alas, this won't work. The older generation in their families doesn't want to join the army. If you tell them, they definitely won't agree. It's best to make up your own mind. I mean well because I heard you say that life is tough, and you can't make a name for yourself your whole life. It's not bad to go out and see the green mountains and clear waters, make more friends, and gain more knowledge. It's up to you whether you go or not. I can't push you too much, or you'll blame me in the future."</p>
<p>"How many days will you be delayed?"</p>
<p>Jiang Niupi counted on his fingers, looking up and saying, "Today is the 21st, not counting, the 22nd to Suzhou to see friends, the 23rd back, the 24th to Dongshan to entrust a few acres of barren land to someone, the 25th maybe delayed there, the 26th back, the 27th will set off, still in time to go to Jiujiang to collect pay at the end of the month."</p>
<p>"There are five whole days, enough for me to think about it."</p>
<p>Jiang Niupi picked off the remaining cigarette butt that was burning the bamboo pipe, blew on it, put it in his pocket, drank a cup of tea in one gulp, and stood up, saying,</p>
<p>"Think it over, then give me an answer."</p>
<p>A'gen also stood up and said insincerely, "Come to my house for a meal before you leave."</p>
<p>"No need to be polite, I have a relative waiting for me. See you later!" He unintentionally stretched his right hand to his right temple, giving an incomplete salute.</p>
<p>A'gen also secretly laughed.</p>
<p>By the evening of the 26th, A'gen's restlessness was indescribable. Liu Da sat on a stone slab under the pumpkin trellis, smoking a dry pipe. Liu's wife sat on a stool made of a tree stump, peeling sunflower seeds. The setting sun shone through the half-yellow pumpkin vines, shining on the faces of the two old people, making them look even more yellow, like two dusty, peeling statues of the Earth God and Earth Goddess, haphazardly placed beside the "Ingredient Division" counter. Only A'gen's face was filled with blood and his spirit was invigorated, like a Spartan warrior from a Western print. One moment, he was depressed, lowering his head and kicking the small bricks on the mud floor, wishing he could kick away everything in the world that hindered life's progress. He wanted to say something, but there was a Master who wouldn't allow it. The things he wasn't allowed to say were stuck in his throat, even worse than having "catarrh" in his throat. Suddenly, Liu's wife broke the lonely evening scene by saying,</p>
<p>"This pumpkin is really big, at least ten pounds. We don't need to cook tomorrow night, let's eat pumpkin."</p>
<p>A'gen heard this and was again touched. If he left with Jiang tomorrow, he wouldn't get to eat this big pumpkin.</p>
<h3>Grain Market Situation at Hexia Continues to Weaken]</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various groups were still arriving in a continuous stream, numbering about fifty. The amount stored in the docks was not substantial. Shops in the city and countryside were connected at the end, and as the sluice gate market was generally weak, people felt indifferent and transactions decreased sharply compared to before. The price of thick japonica rice suddenly dropped slightly. Arrivals of late-season rice were not weak, but transactions on this street remained thin. Transactions of Ningbo glutinous rice were also fragmented, and the market price was slightly reduced. The price of foreign Dujian rice fluctuated.</p>
<p>(Xinzha) There were thirty to forty sources on the west road, and there were some transactions on this street. Changzhou and Wuxi japonica rice with added foot was the most traded, and the price was stable. The rice market in Suzhou and Kunshan was quiet, and prices were weak by one or two cents. Sales of early and late-season rice were slow, and the market followed suit. Quanzhou merchants actively handled customer indica rice.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign customer indica rice market was initially weak, but then local customers made inquiries, and the market began to stabilize. Quanzhou merchants suddenly showed strong interest, and Fuzhou merchants also actively handled shipments, turning the market from weak to active. On this street, another Saigon shipment of 400 bags was sold. The foreign rice market also became firm. However, customer indica rice arrived continuously at the port, and yesterday, two more ships of Hunan and Jiangxi rice arrived. Currently, the market has ample supply. Although Fujian province is buying, supply exceeds demand, and the market will likely find it difficult to expand. Although customer sales were active yesterday, the price was slightly lower by a fraction. The overall market quoted Saigon No. 1 rice at 400 bags, with the price remaining at 8 yuan. Jiangxi machine-milled late rice at 761 bags was priced at 8 yuan, 57 cents to 8 yuan and 50 cents, and another 50 bags of machine-milled yuan rice were priced at 11 yuan. Hunan machine-milled oil rice at 507 bags was priced at 8 yuan, 82 cents to 8 yuan and 78 cents. Saigon rice was purchased by merchants from this street, machine-milled yuan rice by merchants from Fuzhou, and the rest by merchants from Quanzhou.</p>
<p>Flour Market: Near Weak, Far Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw sluggish spot sales, with no further purchasing as previous purchases had been too large, and appetites were satisfied. For the time being, people are watching and waiting, hoping to take action again after the market price weakens. This month, due to spot goods, prices are also softening. However, forward contracts are being supported by mill positions, and the market is recovering from weakness. After the market opened in the morning, the price of foreign wheat was reported to be slightly lower, and people became cautious. However, mills were not dumping their positions, and it was difficult to lower prices further. Therefore, trading was slow and the market was stable. In the afternoon, the market became more active. At the close, November was down .025, December was up .075, January to March were all up .075, and April was up .025.</p>
<p>Wheat Market: Trend Remains Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was sluggish in both the morning and afternoon sessions, with few transactions. Prices were slightly lower as the price of foreign wheat fell by about 2 cents, and there was Australian wheat selling for 3.5 taels. People in the market were generally cautious, and forward contracts were especially weak. In the afternoon, the price of Australian wheat rose, and it was difficult to secure orders. As the flour market turned around, those shorting the market did not continue to sell, and those with open positions were looking to cover. However, sales were very limited, and trading was even more subdued. At the close, the current month was up .01, and there were no comparable prices for December, January, and February. April was also up .01.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat Continues to Weaken</p>
<p>A report from the New Feng Foreign Firm stated that on Monday (the 21st), Chicago wheat fell across all periods due to poor foreign demand and long positions being liquidated. On the 19th, a total of 20 million bushels were traded. The market prices for the 21st are listed below:</p>
<p>Close Price Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>December Four Two point Seven Five Zero Down Zero point Five Zero Zero</p>
<p>May Four Eight point One Two Five Down Zero point Five Zero Zero</p>
<p>July Four Nine point Three Seven Five Down Zero point Five Zero Zero</p>
<p>Dried Goods and Nut Stall Guild Decides to Reduce Prices</p>
<p>The supply of dried longan has been increasing recently, while sales have been decreasing. Although there are restrictions on sales prices set by the guild, competition has intensified due to fewer buyers, leading to hidden discounts and a chaotic pricing situation. To rectify this, the guild convened a meeting yesterday and decided to uniformly reduce prices for all grades of dried longan to standardize them. The top grade is set at 33 taels, Tianji at 17 taels, Tianhong at 13 taels, peeled at 9 taels, Zheng Er at 8.5 taels, and Pao Yuan at 8 taels (local and inland areas to be added).</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Actual Sales of Sugar Goods Increase</p>
<p>The sugar market saw little change in the standard price, but sales suddenly surged, raising expectations and causing prices to rise. The guild's standard price for No. 24 coarse granulated white ordinary sugar was initially set at 15 taels, 9 qian, 2 fen, 5 li, but later rose to 9 qian, 5 fen, an increase of 5 to 7.5 fen from the previous day, with about 3,000 bags traded. High-quality goods were priced at 15 taels and 0.05 fen. No. 18 and No. 20 medium granulated white sugar were stable. No. 8 Hechi new goods were 11 taels and 6 qian, up 5 fen; old goods were 11 taels and 2 qian, up a qian. No. 9 old Hechi was 11 taels and 5.5 qian, No. 10 old goods were 11 taels, 6 qian, 2 fen, 5 li, and high No. 11 was 12 taels. Taikoo car sugar BCWDY brands all remained at the original price, and HX brand was 15 taels, 1 qian, 5 fen, up 5 fen. Chaozhou merchants offered Huizhou sugar excluding 60-70 bags at a price of 11 taels and 8 qian. Small brick sugar was reported to have arrived continuously, and the goods were very dry and light in color.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea Foreign Firms: Silk Market Weakens Further</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firms' silk market continued to be weak and quiet. Telegrams regarding American silk prices remained unchanged. European firms, seeing the sluggishness of overseas silk prices, considered lowering prices and stockpiling. Chinese silk merchants were unwilling to sell at a loss, leading to a sluggish market. Exports of Douppion silk were increasingly rare.</p>
<p>Exports of Douppion silk to Europe have remained stagnant for a long time, and overseas silk prices have plummeted. In Shanghai, only Fulun Silk Factory is still operating. Recently, sales to France have remained sluggish, and sales of Douppion silk have been sluggish. On this French postal ship "Qin Liao Mei Jing", only 15 bales of Douppion silk were exported to Marseille.</p>
<p>Zhejiang's Old Mill Silk is Continuously Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>A total of over 700 bales</p>
<p>Since receiving three announcements from the Committee for Sorting Old Silkworm Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, silk and cocoon merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have respectively reported and registered the quantity of old mill silk and dried cocoons in their possession so that they can enjoy duty-free and 100 tael subsidy per bale when old mill silk is exported. It is learned that the issuance of Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk industry public bonds is imminent. Silk and cocoon merchants in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Huzhou, Zhejiang, who hold old cocoons, are actively entrusting local silk mills to produce silk, transport it to Shanghai for storage. Therefore, the shipping of old mill silk to Shanghai is not weak, with a total of 778 bales being shipped.</p>
<p>Needle and Eyebrow Green Tea Sells Well in Europe</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yingzhuang, Qiahe, Xiehe, Jinlong, and Tongfu firms showed strong interest in needle and eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi. However, due to thin inventories, supply could not meet demand. Most merchants were searching for Gongxi tea to be processed into needle and eyebrow tea. As for Zhenmei green tea, there were still over 20,000 boxes in inventory. Although Yingzhuang firms had some sales yesterday, the prices offered were too low, and Chinese tea merchants could not agree to the deals due to large losses. Transactions for other Gongxi goods were also declining.</p>
<p>Hardware: English Steel Plate Scarce and Expensive</p>
<p>Hardware transactions have been peaceful recently. Due to tight credit, foreign merchants are not as eager to make large purchases as before. Manufacturers, except for purchasing essential goods, are less inclined to stockpile. Fortunately, imports of various goods are not large, so there have not been significant changes in prices. However, some popular items have limited arrivals, so the standard price is rising. For example, English steel plates have been purchased by various merchants recently, leading to a shortage of inventory and soaring prices. 2% can be estimated at 8 taels 2 qian 5 fen, 5% at 6 taels 2 qian 5 fen, 7% at 6 taels, 10% at 5 taels 9 qian, and above 15% is estimated at 5 taels 7 qian 5 fen. However, overseas arrivals are rare, so prices are expected to rise further. Other items such as bamboo joint steel bars, new silver dollars, white tile, and tinplate are also showing signs of continued increases. Judging from the current hardware market, falling prices are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p>

<p>Local News Two First Special Court Opened Yesterday Anhui Northern Relief Wheat Scandal Only First Defendant Yang Shucheng Was Interrogated Then It Stopped Zha Liangzhao Debated and Counter-Sued, With Incidental Civil Suit Requesting Compensation for 500,000 Half for Relief, Half for School ### The Shocking Anhui Northern Relief Wheat Scandal: After the Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association Filed a Private Prosecution with the First Special District Court Against Yang Shucheng, Quan Shaowu, Wang Fanwu, Zha Liangzhao, and Others, Staff of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee, It Has Been Heard Twice. As the Four Defendants Were All Outside the City, They Were Unable to Attend Court. Yesterday Afternoon at 2 PM, the Trial Was Held in the Criminal Court Two of the First Special District Court. The Original Defendants and Defense Lawyers, Including Zhang Shizhao, Were All Present. On the Plaintiff's Side, Li Zhenya Spoke. The Defendants Yang Shucheng, Quan Shaowu, Wang Fanwu, Zha Liangzhao, and Others Stood in the Defendant's Column. After the Judge Asked Their Names, Ages, Native Places, and Occupations, Zha Liangzhao, Due to Illness, Was Ordered to Sit in the Witness Stand. The Debate Began Regarding Yang Shucheng's Abuse of Power, Obstructing Transportation, Purchasing Relief Wheat, and Selling It at a High Price. The American Baker, Head of the Transportation Department of the Disaster Relief Association, Was Immediately Called to Testify. The Court Adjourned at Half Past Four, Ordering a Continued Hearing on the Afternoon of the 25th. Zha Liangzhao Hired Lawyers Such as Zhang Shizhao to Draft a Defense and File a Counter-Suit. The Debate and Zha's Statement Are Recorded Below. ▲Debate: First, Li Zhenya, Representative of the Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association, Stated That Last Year, the 21 Counties in Northern Anhui Suffered a Major Flood. Some of the Relief Workers Delayed Transportation and Purchased Relief Wheat to Sell at a High Price for Personal Gain. The Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association Received Repeated Appeals and Reports From Representatives of the Disaster Victims in Northern Anhui. They Did Not Dare to Believe Such Heartless Behavior. Later, They Sent Two Commissioners Each With the Beijing Fellow-Provincials Association Relief Committee to Northern Anhui to Conduct a Factual Investigation and Obtained 100 Pieces of Evidence. After the Association Received the Investigators' Report, They Believed That the Disaster Relief Committee Would Take Appropriate Measures to Resolve the Situation. Unexpectedly, After a Long Time, There Was Still No Response, So They Had No Choice but to Seek a Legal Solution. Later, the Plaintiff's Lawyer, Li Shirui, Stated That the First Defendant, Yang Shucheng, 1. Used His Power to Stop the Transportation of Relief Wheat in Order to Transport His Own Purchased Wheat. From January 18th to February 10th, Not a Single Grain of Relief Wheat Was Transported From Pukou to Bengbu. During This Cold Winter, How Many Disaster Victims Starved to Death? 2. Transported His Privately Purchased Wheat, Pretending It Was Relief Wheat, Free of Charge. 3. Claimed That It Was Difficult to Transport Relief Wheat, So He Sold 10,000 Tons to the Baoxing Flour Mill, Which Yang Solely Owned. Most of It Was Delivered in Bengbu. If It Was Necessary to Sell Because Relief Wheat Could Not Be Transported to Bengbu, and It Was Already in Bengbu, Then Why Sell It? 4. The Relief Wheat That Yang Purchased Cost Over 80 Yuan Per Ton, While the Price of Wheat in Bengbu Was 7 to 10 Yuan Per Stone, Which Is Over 120 to 170 Yuan Per Ton. With a Single Transfer, He Would Profit at Least 40 Yuan. Yang Purchased a Total of 10,000 Tons, Which Would Earn Him Over 400,000 Yuan. How Many Lives of Disaster Victims in Northern Anhui Would This Take? Subsequently, Yang Shucheng Argued That His Authority Was Only to Assist With Transportation Matters. There Were Others Specifically Assigned to This Task. The Person in Charge Was the American Baker. Yu Shaozhen and an American Were in Charge of the Jinpu Road. Moreover, on January 20th, He Was Still in Henan. He Returned to Bengbu on the 21st and Received the Letter of Appointment. He Arrived in Pukou on the 22nd. He Had Absolutely No Connection With the Suspension of Relief Wheat Transportation. Li Shirui Also Presented Baker's Report Published in the Xinwenbao in Mid-May, Stating That Baoxing Factory Wheat Competed With Relief Wheat, Making Transportation Difficult, and That the Difficulties Could Be Reduced if 10,000 Tons of Wheat Were Sold to Baoxing. The Court Immediately Called Baker to Testify. Baker Stated That Yang's Authority Was Indeed Only to Assist and Compete With Transportation. Finally, Both Sides' Lawyers Again Involved the Time Issue. As It Was Necessary to Consult the Case Files, the Court Adjourned. ▲Zha's Statement: Zha Liangzhao, Director of the Emergency Relief Department of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee, Hired Three Lawyers, Zhang Shizhao, Yuan Liang, Tang Pengyuan, and Xun to Present a Defense and File a Counter-Suit. Xu Shiying, Guan Jianfan, Li Zhenya, Lu Juewu, Xu Jiashi, Hong Ding, Wang Zhuru, Hu Peiru, Etc., the Original Statement Said That He Was Falsely Accused of Abuse of Power and Breach of Trust by the Legal Representatives of the Anhui Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association, the Plaintiff in the Self-Lawsuit. He Submits a Defense in Accordance with the Law, Files a Counterclaim, and Submits an Incident Civil Suit. In Recent Years, Liang Zhao Has Been Temporarily Entrusted to Disaster Relief Undertakings in Various Educational Positions in Shaanxi, Gansu, and the Yangtze River Basin. He Has Devoted Himself to His Work for Several Years and Has Prepared for Hardships. This Aspiration Has Not Changed in the Least. Without Guilt, He Can Ask Heaven and Earth. Why Should He Endure False Accusations? Now, the Plaintiffs Do Not Hesitate to Reverse Black and White, Fabricate Facts, and Accuse Him of Unfounded Crimes to Your Court, Confusing the Hearing and Damaging His Reputation. It Is Difficult to Tolerate. In Addition to Submitting a Defense, He Will File a Counterclaim in Accordance with the Law and Include a Civil Suit. He Will Submit the Reasons as Follows. "Defense Section" Zha Argued That the Plaintiffs Disregarded the Facts, Arbitrarily Framed Him, and Did Not Consider the Authority and Responsibilities of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee in Handling Affairs. Instead, They Fabricated Facts Against Individuals. Therefore, None of the Allegations Were Based on Facts, and None Were Fabricated. He Will Now Correct Them Based on Facts. A. The Truth About the Conversion of American Wheat Into Cash. According to the National Government Disaster Relief Committee, in Order to Facilitate Relief Work, It Negotiated With the U.S. Government to Agree to Convert a Portion of the Borrowed American Wheat Into Cash. It Invited Well-Known Figures From Both China and Foreign Countries in Shanghai to Form a Grain Exchange Committee, Collect Public Opinion, and Proceed Publicly. The Process, the Amount of Wheat Sold, and the Funds Were Published in Newspapers and Reported at the General Meeting of the Disaster Relief Committee on June 27 of This Year and Announced to the Public. This Matter Related to the Overall Plan of the Disaster Relief Committee and Was Not Limited to Any Local Disaster Area. Therefore, the Plaintiffs Disregarded the Facts and Issued Implied Words to Confuse the Public Hearing. What Was Their Purpose? It Is Incomprehensible. B. Responsibilities of the Director of the Emergency Relief Department. According to Liang Zhao, He Was the Director of the Emergency Relief Department, but He Was Not a Member of the Grain Exchange Committee. The Plaintiffs Clearly Knew That the Allegations Were Not Within the Scope of the Responsibilities of the Director of the Emergency Relief Department. Therefore, They Insisted That He Was a Member of the Grain Exchange Committee, Thinking That in This Way, They Could Arbitrarily Slander Him. They Did Not Know That One Look at the List of Members of the Grain Exchange Committee Would Reveal That All Chinese and Foreign Members Were Socially Credible and Enthusiastic About Public Welfare. Their Impartial Handling of Affairs Could Not Be Slandered in the Least. Moreover, Liang Zhao Was Not a Member of the Committee. The Plaintiffs Fabricated Facts and Intended to Incriminate People Deliberately. It Only Showed That Their Efforts Were in Vain. It Is So Regrettable. C. The Truth About Signing the Contract. The Contract Between the National Government Disaster Relief Committee and Baoxing Flour Mill to Sell Wheat Was Signed by Vice Chairman Simpson on Behalf of the Committee. There Was the Original Contract as Proof. However, the Plaintiffs Claimed That Liang Zhao "Coerced the First Defendant and Signed the Price Change Contract Up to Three Times," Thinking That They Could Confuse the Public Hearing and Falsely Accuse the Defendant. They Did Not Know That Those Who Signed the Contract on Behalf of the Disaster Relief Committee Were Not Liable. Moreover, Liang Zhao Was Not a Party to Signing the Contract. The Plaintiffs Intended to Subject People to Criminal Penalties and Did Not Hesitate to Reverse Right and Wrong and Fabricate Facts. It Was Truly the Most Ridiculous Thing. "Counterclaim Section" A. Regarding the Criminal Suit Section. Based on the Above Discussion, It Is Known That the Plaintiffs Are Purely Maliciously Framing Him and Fabricating Facts. For the Dignity of the Law, for the Future of Relief Work, and for the Individual's Legal Interests, It Is Difficult to Remain Silent. It Is Requested That Your Court Severely Punish Him in Accordance With the Provisions of Article 180 of the Criminal Law Regarding False Accusations and Articles 325, 330, and 332 Regarding Damage to Reputation. B. Regarding the Civil Suit Section. Since the Plaintiffs Filed a False Accusation Against Liang Zhao, They Have Tried Their Best to Publicize It and Promote It. The Newspapers Are Noisy and Spread North and South. Everyone Is Talking About It. No Matter Old or Young, Liang Zhao's Personal Reputation Has Suffered Tremendous Damage. Even the National Government Disaster Relief Committee and Other Relief Groups and Charitable Organizations Have Been Subject to Slander. It Is Extremely Painful. Therefore, He Will File a Civil Suit in Accordance With the Law, Requesting That the Plaintiffs Be Ordered to Compensate Him 500,000 Yuan for Loss of Reputation. Use Half of the Money to Run Children's Education in the Disaster Area of Northern Anhui and the Other Half to Subsidize Poor Students in Pingjin Schools. (Explanation: Liang Zhao Values Relief Work and Social Reputation Ten Times More Than Life. In the Autumn of the 19th Year of the Republic of China, He Was Kidnapped by Bandits While Providing Relief in Shaanxi. He Was Once Ransomed for 50,000 Yuan. Later, the Bandits Were Kidnapped by Other Bandits. Fortunately, He Was Rescued Without Ransom. The Price of Reputation Is Unlimited and Difficult to Calculate With Money. Moreover, the Spiritual Pain Inflicted on Liang Zhao by the Plaintiffs This Time Is Hundreds of Times Greater Than the Bandits in Shaanxi Hindering Liang Zhao's Physical Freedom. Now, He Will Temporarily Calculate It as Ten Times the Price of the Bandits Ransoming His Life. It Should Be the Above Number and Used to Fill the Just Cause. It Will Also Supplement the Insufficiency of Disaster Relief.) As for All the Losses Suffered Due to the False Accusation This Time, He Should Also Apply to Retain the Right to Claim Compensation in Order to Maintain Legal Interests. Therefore, He Will Urgently Submit a Statement and Report the Facts Truthfully. He Respectfully Asks Your Court to Investigate and Judge Impartially. It Will Be Public Convenience. Respectfully, to the Shanghai First Special District Court. November 22nd, 21st Year of the Republic of China. Huang Diao Invented Tuning Characters ▲Overseas Chinese in Saigon Focus on Phonetics ▲To Go to Beijing Soon to Register With the Ministry Huang Diao, a Cantonese, Has Been Trading in Saigon Since Childhood. He Deeply Feels That the Lack of Uniformity in China's Language Has a Great Impact on the Popularization of Education. Therefore, He Has Focused on Studying Phonetics. He Started With Roman Letters and Studied for More Than Ten Years, but He Could Not Succeed. In the Second Year of the Republic of China, He Changed His Approach and Studied the Book of Changes, Using the Eight Trigrams of Fuxi as a Blueprint. He Developed and Changed Until the Fourteenth Year of the Republic of China, When He Achieved Complete Results. He Also Created a Tuning Dictionary With 7,600 Characters and a Textbook With 4,000 Characters. All the Languages in the World Can Be Spelled, and the Teaching Method Is Also Extremely Simple. The Entire Course Can Be Completed in Six Months. Mr. Huang Is Now 64 Years Old. He Is Deeply Afraid That Heaven Will Not Grant Him Many Years and That It Will Be Lost. Therefore, He Returned to China a Month Ago, Via Hong Kong to Guangzhou. He Has Given Lectures at Zhongshan University. He Recently Came to Shanghai Via Shantou. He Plans to Go to Beijing Soon to Register With the Ministry of Education and Then Establish a School to Teach. Piggy Bank to Save the Country ▲Peacock Company Custom-Made 1,000 to Give to Relatives and Friends ▲Do Not Abandon Words Because of People, Follow Liang Zuoyou's Method Although Liang Zuoyou's Piggy Bank to Save the Country Is Ridiculed by the Chinese People, It Is Not a Good Model for Saving the Country if It Can Be Practiced and Implemented. It Should Not Be Abandoned Because of People's Words. The Peacock Company in This City Established a Piggy Bank to Save the Country Yesterday. It Specially Custom-Made 1,000 Piggy Banks and Distributed Them to Relatives and Friends, Asking Them to Transfer Them to Family Members or Raise Funds From Outside. The Funds Raised Were All Put Into the Piggy Bank. After It Was Full, It Would Be Sent Directly to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association to Provide Relief to the Volunteer Army. The Group Specially Sent a Representative, You Baiyan, to the Support Association for Contact Yesterday. He Brought Several Piggy Banks Stored With Donations. After the Association Broke Them, It Revealed the Number of Foreign Currencies and Issued Receipts. Riot Police Drove People Away During the Trial of the Yun Case ▲Tu Shanyuan Asked for Punishment and Apology The Yun Huifang Case, a Young Patriot, Was Tried in the Second Branch of the Higher Court of the Public Concession the Other Day. The Police Department Anticipated That There Would Be a Large Number of Spectators That Day, so They Specially Dispatched Chinese and Western Detectives to Prepare Temporarily. That Day, a Western Police Officer Saw That the Spectators Were Very Crowded, Which Hindered Order, So He Used Force to Drive Them Away, Whipping the Audience With His Leather Whip. People Fled in Succession. Tu Shanyuan, Deputy Officer of the Volunteer Army Training Class of the 19th Route Army, Saw This and Was Very Angry. He Protested Against the Western Police Officer Without Success. So Yesterday, He Sent a Letter to the Shanghai Aid Patriotic Patriots Committee, Asking for Reasonable Contact to Achieve the Purpose of Punishing the Murderers and Apologizing. The Letter Said, “Respected Sirs, Yesterday Was the Date for the Appeal Trial of the Yun Huifang Case. Members of This Association and All Citizens Wanted to Understand the Progress of This Case. They All Went to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court to Attend the Hearing. The Court Had Previously Announced That It Would Be Open to the Public, but Temporarily Rejected the Public From the Court. Although There Were Many People, According to the Principle of Public Disclosure, the Participation of the Public Should Be Accommodated as Much as Possible. However, the Court Did Not Do This. Instead, Foreign Bailiffs Instructed Chinese Western Police Officers to Use Force to Drive Away the Public Who Were Rejected From the Court, and Even Used Leather Whips to Beat Them. People, Shanyuan, Were Also One of Those Who Were Insulted at That Time. The Entire Audience Was Forced to Retreat From the Public Court Under the Coercion of Foreign Nationalism. The Concession Court Is Difficult to Restrain by the Agreement, and the Actions of Foreign Police Officers Should Be Subject to the Command of the Chief Officer of the Court to Exercise Their Powers. However, This Time, the Foreign Bailiffs of the Court Instructed Western Police Officers to Take Such Unreasonable Actions Against the Public. Whether It Was Subject to the Order of the Chief Officer, If So, the Court's Use of Power Outside the Law Is Illegal. Otherwise, the Western Police Officer Who Committed the Crime and the Foreign Bailiff Who Instructed the Crime Openly Insulted the Chinese People and Destroyed Our Country's Legal Spirit. They Should Be Subject to Criminal Penalties. Shanyuan's Personal Insult Is a Small Matter, but the Entire National Judicial Organ Was Destroyed by Foreign Police Officers, Which Has a Huge Impact. Therefore, I Specially Submit a Letter to State the Process, Please Contact Your Committee Reasonably, and Be Sure to Achieve the Purpose of Punishing the Murderers and Apologizing. It Is Not Only the Luck of the People in the Concession, but Also the Luck of the Country's Future.” Assassination Attempt by Thugs in Songpan Road ▲Liu Guilin and His Wife Escaped Successfully Liu Guilin, 31 Years Old, From Changzhou, His Wife, Ms. Qian, Works in the Third Cotton Factory. The Couple Went to Their Parents' Home for Dinner Last Night. As It Was Late, They Walked Home. Unexpectedly, When They Reached the Vicinity of Songpan Road in Yangshupu, a Man Came Towards Them, Pulled Out a Handgun, and Fired Two Shots at Their Heads. He Turned Around and Fled. Fortunately, the Couple Escaped Successfully. Only Their Heads Were Grazed by Bullets. Liu Immediately Shouted for Help. The Nearby Police Heard It and Arrived. Seeing That the Murderer Had Escaped, They Sent the Two to the Nearby Sacred Heart Hospital for Treatment. Later, According to Liu, This Murderer Was Acquainted With Him, and Liu Had Introduced Him to a Job. However, At That Time, Liu Had Asked Him for Two Yuan in Sports Fees and Embezzled It. Later, the Murderer Learned About It, but He Did Not Ask About It. Recently, the Murderer's Job Was Stopped. Recalling the Previous Situation, He May Have Been Resentful and Had the Intention. When Asked About the Murderer's Name, He Firmly Refused to Tell. Therefore, the Police Believed That There Were Other Insider Information, So They Have Sent Detectives to Investigate and Arrest the Fugitive Murderer for Interrogation. China Merchants Bureau Reassigned Yuan Genchu as Director of Hankou Branch Li Shaochuan, Director of the Hankou Branch of the China Merchants Bureau, Was Originally a Relative of General Manager Li Guojie.

Concrete Measures Have Been Taken for Consolidating the Postal Base Program ▲Minister Zhu Telegraphed the Postal Workers and Staff Unions ▲Instructed Representatives to Go to Beijing to Solicit Opinions The Postal Economic System Research Committee Has Held No Less Than 20 Meetings Since Its Organization and Establishment.

The Staff Union Has Also Appointed Ge Fei, Shi Zhidang, and Others, a Total of Four People, to Go to Beijing on the Night Train Last Night. They Are Expected to Talk With Minister Zhu at 4 PM Today and Discuss Everything. Taijiabao Relief Hospital Site Determined The Jiangsu Provincial War Zone Relief Committee Previously Decided to Purchase Land to Build the Taijiabao Relief Hospital. The Preparatory Committee Has Surveyed the Land and Found That There Are More Than 200 Mu of Land at the Junction of Changjing in Taicang, Humin in Jiading, and Gou in Baoshan. There Are Few Houses and Graves. It Is Also Next to the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, With Convenient Transportation and a Suitable Location. It Is Planned to Measure and Collect It Immediately. However, After the War, the People Were Poor and Not Recovered. It Is Appropriate to Give a Favorable Price. Therefore, It Is Specifically Set That the Price of Each Mu of Field Is 120 Yuan, the Fee for Moving Each House Is 100 Yuan, and the Fee for Moving Each Coffin Is 20 Yuan to Show Sympathy. The Preparatory Committee Has Sent a Letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Asking It to Instruct the County Magistrates of the Three Counties to Issue a Notice and Order the Township Chiefs of the Three Townships to Inform the Owners in Order to Avoid Misunderstandings and Facilitate the Progress.

Negotiations Have Now Been Conducted With the Electrical Construction Company to Move the Parking Place to the West of Shandong Road, Because the Road Surface Has Been Widened a Lot There. Authors and Publishers Present to the Ministry of Interior to Investigate Piracy The China Authors and Publishers Federation Was Established in July This Year. Shi Zuocai, Director-General of the Federation, Came to Shanghai the Other Day. The Colleagues of the Shanghai Office of the Federation Hosted a Banquet to Welcome Him. This Was Recorded in This Newspaper. Now, the Federation Has Submitted a Document to the Ministry of Interior Regarding the Piracy of Unscrupulous Merchants, Which Said, “Presently, Unscrupulous Merchants of Piracy Are Illegally Profiting. We Request That You Instruct the Provincial Governments of All Provinces to Instruct the Local Public Security Bureaus to Strictly Punish Them in Order to Extend the Rule of Law and Benefit Culture. Publishing Is Originally for the Purpose of Promoting Culture. It Is Not Without Considerable Contribution to the Country and Society. Since the Last 50 Years, Academic Arts and Literature Have Been Changing With Each Passing Day. Talents Have Emerged in Large Numbers. Writings Have Increased. Those Who Learn Either Study Hard and Pass on Knowledge in Books, or Engage in Translation and Introduce Foreigners to the Chinese People. If They Do Not Accumulate Experience and Spend Years, They Cannot Become Writings and Commend Later Generations. Publishers Print and Distribute for Them, or Donate Manuscript Fees or Pay Royalties. They All Have the Intention of Encouraging Learning. From Receiving the Manuscripts to Completing the Books, The Number of People Required for Correction, Proofreading, Typesetting, and Printing Is Large, and the Time Is Not Temporary. The Heavy and Hard Work Is Probably Not Enough for Outsiders to Say. After the Books Are Completed, If There Is No Advertising to Promote Them, There Is No Way to Seek the Knowledge of Readers. If There Are No Intermediate Merchants to Sell Them, There Is No Way to Reach the Hands of Readers. Therefore, the Cost of Paper and Printing for a Book May Seem Very Small, but When Added to the Manuscript Fees and Royalties of the Authors, the Salaries of the Correctors, the Cost of Advertising and Promotion, the Rebates of the Sales Merchants, and the Interest on the Principal Required Before the Book Is Completed, The Number Is Often Several Times That of Paper and Printing. In Books With More Readers and Wider Sales, a Little Profit May Be Gained, but Special Writings With Profound Learning Often Result in Losses. However, Publishers Cannot Be Profitable and Abandon Special Writings, Allowing Them to Be Buried. They Can Only Use What They Earn to Supplement What They Lack, Hoping to Give the Opportunity for Deep Academic Knowledge to Still Be Developed and Promoted. However, There Are Unscrupulous Merchants of Piracy Who Do Not Know What Learning Is. They Only Seek Their Own Private Interests. They Form Gangs to Specialize in Selecting Books With Wider Sales, Secretly Reprinting Them, and Selling Them Openly. The Gourds Are the Same, and the Hai Shi Are Full of Errors. There Are Also Some Literary Villagers and Book Worms Who Borrow the Name of Criticism to Collect the Profits of Piracy. They Even Change the Head and Face, Overturn the Chapters, Falsely Title the Books, and Falsely Accuse the Authors. Readers Do Not Know It, but They Only Know to Be Greedy for the Low Price. They Do Not Have Time to Ask About the Confusion of the Content and the Poor Quality of the Paper and Ink. They Compete to Buy It, Helping Them to Run Rampant. Their Poisonous Stupidity for Learning and Moths for Culture Are Indeed Unpardonable. Although the Country Protects Copyrights and Has Promulgated Special Laws and Regulations on Criminal Penalties, These People Act Like Ghosts, Disregarding Laws and Disciplines. Even if They Are Sometimes Caught, They Are Often Regarded as Minor Matters and Dealt With Lightly. Shallow People Also Echo It From There, Thinking That the Original Version Is Expensive and the Pirated Version Is Cheap, Causing These People to Become More Unscrupulous. They Dare to Collect Huge Funds as a Profession. The Breadth of the Sales Covers All Regions. In the Long Run, Not Only Will Those Who Operate Legitimate Publishing Businesses All Tend to Decline, but Also Those Writers Who Take Learning as Their Profession and Writing as Their Livelihood Will Not Be Able to Survive. Soon, There Will Be No Books to Read in the Market, and Everyone Will Be Unlearned. The Harm to the Country and Society Is Limited. The Unscrupulous Merchants Started Mostly in Beiping. Then They Spread to Various Places. Beiping Repeatedly Cracked Major Piracy Cases. Tianjin and Jinan Also Found Several Cases at the Same Time. They Have All Been Sent to the Local Authorities for Punishment in Accordance With the Law. Recently, It Was Found That Many Bookstores in Major Cities in the Northwest Provinces Display a Lot of Pirated and False Books. These Unscrupulous Merchants Dare to Disregard Laws and Disciplines and Sell Them Openly. If They Are Not Severely Punished, How Can We Warn Against Evil and Guard Against Future Disasters? For This Reason, We Request That Your Ministry Instruct the Provincial Governments of All Provinces to Instruct the Local Public Security Bureaus to Investigate and Punish Them Strictly in Order to Extend the Rule of Law and Benefit Culture. It Is Truly a Public Convenience.” Pudong Electric Company Revises Loan Lighting Installation Method The Pudong Electric Company Has Formulated Loan Lighting Installation Methods to Give Preferential Treatment to Users. Since Implementation, It Has Been Stable and Convenient. Recently, This Method Has Been Appropriately Modified to Make It More Perfect. All Users Who Install Three Lights and Connect the Household Line Can Borrow 12 Yuan From the Company, Which Can Be Repaid in 12 Months, Paying One Yuan Per Month Without Interest. Therefore, Small Users Who Install Three Lights Only Need to Pay a Deposit of Five Yuan in Accordance With the Regulations to Connect to the Power Supply. Later, They Will Pay a Monthly Installation Fee of One Yuan in the First Year, Which Is Easy to Raise. The Revised Method Is Recorded as Follows. 1.

<h3>Gold Price Rises Again by Five Taels</h3>
<p>(The entire city is chaotic and unpredictable) Yesterday, the market saw another hidden upward trend, with considerable volatility, fluctuating rapidly between 760 taels or so. The disordered state made it difficult to grasp the market. The city saw a rise of six taels and one qian, ultimately resulting in a total increase of five taels and two qian. The minds of those in the trade were divided, and withdrawals were irregular. The silver market showed no flexibility, and exchange rates plummeted. Moreover, due to the war-related extension issue and the lack of sympathy from the United States, the price of gold initially surged, soon surpassing the 60-tael mark. However, the overseas situation shifted slightly, with the British pound strong and the US dollar stable, and potentially changing. As a result, the gold price experienced fluctuations of more than two taels mid-day. In the afternoon, due to the Central Bank swapping December for January (swapping 5,600 bars to the Guangdong banks, with a premium of only six taels), the selling pressure was pervasive on the surface, leading to a state of exhaustion, and the price plunged by five taels. Soon after, demand became active because the exchange rate was still stable, regaining strength. Subsequently, it rose above 60 taels again. It is said that the forward trading from the previous day was done at six and a half taels, and in the afternoon, Fuchang acted on behalf of the Central Bank to swap 4,025 bars to Hengxing and 1,575 bars to Yifeng.</p>
<p>(New price of 60 taels appears) From the early opening of January contracts, the price increased by two taels and seven qian, reaching 759 taels and three qian. Large bars did not change, and the price of American silver was nearly stable, not influenced by the decline in exchange rates and American cotton. Then, the price slightly decreased by six or seven qian to eight taels and six qian. Soon after, buying momentum rose, including Yuanheng, Qingfayong, Zhaofengchang, Yuanmao, Hengchangyong, Kangxiang, and Hengyu. Also, because December US dollar trades were at 5625 and Shanghai sold half a yuan to HSBC this month, the price jumped four taels, reaching 62 taels and seven qian. At that time, Huabi offered December half a yuan and January 5625, Yuanmaoyong, Yuantai, Zhaofengchang, Dadecheng, and Hengxing came to sell, immediately reducing the price by over two taels. Around 9:20 AM, it was 60 taels and five qian. It was learned that the order was placed with a half-point spread (125). The US dollar did not change, due to the slight relationship with the exchange rate, the market was flat, from one tael to zero taels and six qian. Subsequently, transactions were sporadic. At 9:45 AM, it was one tael and four qian, Yuhe and Yifengyong sold. Around 10:00 AM, it was 60 taels and four qian. Later, Dadecheng, Futaiheng, Daxingyong, Hengchangyong, Zhaofengchang, Zhifengyong, etc., bought in. In addition, wheat firms absorbed March US dollars at 8125, and January settled at 5625. As December half a yuan was not easily available, the price saw a new price of 62 taels and eight qian. In an instant, Hengxing, Zhaofengchang, Hongli, Wanxing, etc., sold. It was also heard from foreign news that the silver price conference was scheduled for the coming spring. Therefore, confidence faltered, and at 10:30 AM, it was 61 taels and six qian. After a while, it rose by about one tael, and Bingxing, etc., bought in. Around 11:00 AM, Zhaofengchang, Yongfeng, Hengyu, Fuchang, and Yuantai, etc., came to the market to sell, and the price could not be sustained, falling to 60 taels and five qian at 11:30 AM. Afterwards, it stabilized, at one tael and five or six qian. By the noon closing, it was one tael and three qian.</p>
<p>(After selling pressure, it turned upward again) The afternoon market opened at 61 taels and two qian, Yuanchun, Dadecheng, Yifengyong, and Yuanmaoyong bought in, and it immediately rose to 62 taels. At 2:15 PM, it was suddenly rumored that the Central Bank had a large batch of forward contracts, willing to swap out at six taels. Hengyu, Yuanxingyong, Yuhe, and Qianchangxiang, etc., all offered to sell, and at 2:30 PM, it was 58 taels and eight qian. Then, it rose to 60 taels and one qian. However, selling pressure increased, and Dadecheng, Shenkang, Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Hengyu, and Daxingyong, etc., sold off, mainly because the Central Bank had indeed swapped 5,600 bars to Hengxing and Yifeng, with a premium of only six taels. However, the exchange market was still flat. Until 3:20 PM, it finally reached 56 taels and seven qian. This price was a supplemental quote, with few transactions. Soon, it suddenly turned upward, because wheat firms, etc., absorbed February US dollars at 75, and Yifengyong, Hengyu, Yuanxingyong, Bingxing, Yuanheng, Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, Yuantai, etc., took advantage of this to drag in, and the bank absorbed November US dollars at half a yuan, and February traded at 6875. Until 4:20 PM, it was 62 taels and one qian, soon reducing by about one tael. At 4:30 PM, the market closed at 61 taels and eight qian, an increase of five taels and two qian compared to the day before. The daily high was 62 taels and eight qian, and the low was 56 taels and seven qian, a difference of six taels and one qian. The net bar was increased by seventeen taels.</p>
<p>(The listed price was five taels less than before) The listed price was still 820 taels, with a commission of 60 taels to 57 or 8 taels. In the afternoon, it was 58 or 9 taels, then 63 taels, and then 58 taels, which was five taels less than the previous day. The registered price was 68 taels for November, 67 taels for December, and 61 taels for January. The supplemental interest was 67 taels in the morning and 68 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>(Various firms had complex and disordered entries and exits) Transactions on the floor were chaotic. Yuanheng, Dadecheng, Xuli, Hengchangyong, Yuankangxiang, Qingfayong, Futaiheng, Richang, Bingxing, and Yuanmao were all buying in. Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Zhaofengchang, Yuantai, Yifengyong, and Daxingyong were all selling. Hengyu had quite a few entries and exits. In the afternoon, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanheng, Bingxing, Wanxing, Xuli, Yifengyong, Yuantai, Futaiheng, and Zhaofengchang were all buying in. Dadecheng and Hengyu had the most complex withdrawals.

The Guangdong banks bought and sold only 300 bars. Hedging transactions were trivial and complex.</p>

<h3>"Foreign" Market Is Quite Prosperous, "Silver" Collection Is Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the financial situation was such that only foreign transactions were active. Due to strong customer sales, there was fierce competition to buy in the market, which in turn made sellers reluctant to sell, waiting for a good price. Thus, the situation gradually tightened, and banks were deliberately seeking to secure the resource with all their might. Therefore, the market sentiment was very strong, and prices frequently reached new levels. The silver market, on the other hand, remained loose and weak. It is feared that in the near future, it will not recover to a high level.</p>
<p>(Interest Rates Rose to New Levels, Discounting Softened) The early market interest rate for "foreign interest" was one hao and two hu and a half higher than the previous afternoon, at 7 qian, 1 fen, and 2 li. The afternoon market continued to rise by one li and two hao and a half, to 7 qian, 1 fen, and 3 li and 2 hao. As a result, it rose by a huge one li and seven hao and a half compared to the previous day's early market. The early and noon markets for "silver discounts" both opened at two fen, which was one fen less than the previous day. The initial premium for checks plus water was two or three fen, then immediately white checks, and finally there were still one or two fen on the market.</p>
<p>(Guangjiao Followed the Increase Due to the Interest Rate Rise) The early market price for "Jiangnan" small foreign silver was 6 qian, 1 fen, and 7 li and a half, which was one li and a half higher than the previous day's early market. The noon market price was the same, with 5,500 jiao transacted in the early market and 3,000 jiao in the noon market. "Guangdong" small foreign silver did not rise or fall in Japan yesterday, but then followed the interest rate rise and increased by one li, with the early market at 6 qian, 1 fen, and 5 li and a half, and the noon market at 6 qian, 1 fen, and 6 li and a half. 115,000 jiao were transacted in the early market and 45,000 jiao in the noon market. "Copper coins" shortened by 1,000 wen, to 396,500,000 wen, with 36,081,500,000 wen transacted, equivalent to 9,100 taels of silver.</p>
<p>(Silver and Foreign Currency Inflows and Outflows Are Strong and Weak) "Silver currency" bank collections were much weaker compared to the previous day. Chinese merchant collection notes were only over 2.2 million, foreign merchant collection notes were over 1.9 million, special collection notes were 2.45 million, various cargo exchange tax miscellaneous collections were 7.56 million, deposit transactions were 1.34 million, warehouse releases were 1.1 million, money shop silver public notes collections were over 32 million, check collections were over 4.4 million, various route exchange collections were over 800,000, and cash collections were 890,000.

Off-market banknotes were 95,000 in the early market and 85,000 in the noon market. Checks were 60,000 in the early market and 70,000 in the noon market. Bank trading was 950,000 in the early market and 1.1 million in the noon market. Various banks' foreign accounts received and delivered over 1.8 million, banknotes were recovered and issued over 2.23 million, foreign currency deposit transactions were over 900,000, money shop foreign currency public notes collections were over 9.7 million, foreign currency check collections were over 1.7 million, foreign currency discount loans inflows and outflows were over 2.1 million, off-site destinations had another 500,000 loaded out yesterday, and small money shop transactions were 890,000.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Rose Sharply Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Good for five or six jiao to one yuan and three or four jiao)</p>
<p>(Transactions reached more than 10.06 million yuan)</p>
<p>Yesterday (22nd), the market conditions of various bonds in the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the futures market rose quite sharply again, the market buying and selling sentiment continued to be more active than before, and the situations between various markets were very lively. The statistics show that the turnover was far better than the previous day. Although there were many kinds of spot transactions, the turnover was still rare. Although there has been no major development in the overall situation, the general situation is indeed better than before. The Lu case has been resolved, and the Shu case will not expand. The domestic situation is indeed optimistic. Therefore, the market sentiment has always been good, and investments from all parties are more active than sales. The price has been rising steadily, much higher than a few months ago. Yesterday's sharp rise in various prices was still due to the approaching delivery date and the strong demand. It was found that the financial industry has also successively increased its holdings recently, and they are all investments, which has a great impact on the market. It is estimated that yesterday, except for the entire Six Customs Tax and the 20-roll current month, which only gained five or six jiao, the rest rose by one yuan to one yuan and three or four jiao. According to statistics, the total spot transactions for the day were 14,000 yuan, the futures were more than 5.6 million in the morning, and more than 5 million in the afternoon, totaling 10,066,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Under Heavy Pressure</h3>
<p>(Sellers Have Ample Chips in Hand)</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market has softened, the situation is calm, but customer sales are still sluggish, and all banks are inactive. The overseas trend of American cotton continues to fall, causing a lack of confidence. Some are adopting a wait-and-see attitude due to thin bottom plates. However, sellers have ample chips in hand, so the pressure is still heavy.</p>
<p>(Manpower Indicator Softened) At the opening of the previous market manpower indicator, the market softened due to the further decline in American cotton. Each month fell by 1, 2, or 3 qian. The market became weaker in the afternoon, and the downward trend intensified, with each month falling by 3, 4, 5, or 7 qian. The total turnover for the day was 33,400 bales. Total Long sold 1,400 bales, Mingde 1,800 bales, Tongxing 1,550 bales, Dachangcheng 1,200 bales, and Tonghe 1,300 bales. Dafeng bought 1,700 bales, Changfeng 2,630 bales, Shenji 1,550 bales, Yichang 1,200 bales, Jifeng 900 bales, and Dachang 900 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>More New Sellers in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market has turned soft again. Because American cotton has fallen continuously and the yarn market has no upward momentum, this has caused profit-takers to close out their positions, and there are more new sellers. The market has rapidly turned downstream. However, a certain manufacturer still bought in this month to抵空 (offset shorts). In the afternoon, the market mostly said that a certain household had 4,000 dans of goods received in October, which have now been delivered. Therefore, the situation is becoming weaker and weaker, but there are still few sources from various routes. It is feared that there will be no large-scale decline in the future. However, the situation of American cotton is still not good, and it is restrained by it.</p>
<p>(Zheng Standard Turns Downstream) At the opening of the Zheng Standard market, the market selling sentiment was strong due to the further decline in American cotton. Each month fell by 2 or 3 qian. In the afternoon, it fell by another 1 and a half qian. The total turnover for the day was 103,300 dans. Rongxing sold 3,000 dans, Shenchang 1,900 dans, Dachangcheng 2,100 dans, Ruiyuan 2,400 dans, Yuantai 2,300 dans, and Changfeng 2,800 dans. Tonghe bought 3,600 dans, Xincheng 4,800 dans, Yuanxingchang 3,900 dans, Jifeng 4,300 dans, Hengde 2,500 dans, and Gengfeng 4,300 dans. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
