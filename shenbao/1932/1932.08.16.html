<h3 id="c1">遙望平津　梓· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日來本埠各報。多傅日人將乘我國内有事時進犯平津之消息。法文上海日報之北平通信。論述日軍思襲平津。竟有「有人在正式承認所謂满洲國前後。再行猛烈襲擊數下以嚇走張學良。其計劃並不足使吾人驚詫」之語。同時日人報紙。更渲染張學良與東北義勇軍之關係。大唱所謂斷然處置之謬論。此皆能使吾人之目光。不得不從汪張去留之問題而轉移於最近的將來之平津局面也。</p>
<p>日人自去九一八以後。每一次重大行爲。必於距發動期多日以前。傅播</p>
<p>嚴重之消息。且其消息必時緊時寬以麻木中國人之視聽。及有機可乘。則突然實行發動錦州事件即其一例也。進犯平津之空氣。自六月下旬開始製造以來。已歷相當時期中國人之神經。亦已因久受彈性之刺激而漸不靈敏。使無東北義勇軍總發動之牽制。則汪張爭論之電報早發。日人非當行動之事實。不待夕而可見斷不能任張學良以旬日之長時日。在北平從容談個人去留此吾人所可斷言者。</p>
<p>近日中國政潮轉趨緩和。張學良之走。似不必如法文報所言。有待於日人之一嚇然張走之時。布置如何寳與日人之是否於此時發動。有非常密切之關係。張於八日對新聞記者談話。聲明其不早去職之原因。爲不忍東北由彼失去而不能由彼收還其言之是否可信。爲另一問題。假使此言果出於由衷。則其人尙不至如一般人所疑爲毫無良心。張能發揮此良心之作用。於武藤信義未到潘陽義勇軍能牽制日人行動之時。對地方治安作充足之準備而下野。使日人更失去一發動之機會。較之悶坐北平愁城中希望失地收還。當稍有意義可言。此吾人遙望平津。而對張不得不寄與最低限度之希望者。　　數日前華盛頓方面。傅北平使團已考慮事變起時之局勢。平津之危機。蓋已爲世界所認識。倘日人蠢然思動之心。能因中外之合力監視而自行減退其熱度其所看定之發動時機。可因中國方面之妥美處置而免被利用。固爲平津地方之幸。否則即使如法記者所言。日本不斷侵略中國難逃公理之詞裁。即使握住公理制裁力之彈簧。（指複雜之國際關係）至不能再忍時能使日人受嚴重之懲創而平津地方。已不堪設想矣此吾人希望北平使團能鑑於上海事件而對日本速用事前遏止之手段也</p>

<p>（一）緣起</p>
<p>十六年大學院成立伊始鑒於國民體育之重要</p>
<p>步惜不久組織變更以致未有成績表現十八年七月間杭州西湖博覧會發起全國運動大會在杭召集敎部曾擬利用機會召集全國體育會議當經電請該會代爲籌備並聘褚民誼先生爲籌備主任袁敦禮黄振華二先生爲籌備委員原定於九月間與全國運動會先後在杭舉行嗣因全運會改期於十九年四月間舉行敎部適於此時召集第二次全國敎育會議時間相近工作繁重恐難兼顧乃决定延期舉行是時褚民誼先生又赴比參加賽會故會議之召集遂致停頓</p>
<p>十八年四月國民政府公布國民體育法業經數年迄未施行關於實施方法之研究討論雖經敎育部與訓練總監部數度磋商終以問題太多非經專家精密之討論未便遽行訂定年來國内民衆體育學校體育每况愈下而世界體育潮流亦在急變之中吾人如不能洞察潮流參酌國民需要急行訂定實施體育方針與標準以爲國内實施體育之準繩則促進體育不過空呼口號充其量亦不過蹈人覆轍而已</p>

<p>吳蘊瑞</p>
<p>近今政府謀全國政敎之統一曾舉行全國軍事會議全國財政會議全國敎育會議等用意至善然輒因内憂外患之迭至政局及經濟之不穩議决案件罕見實行至爲可惜此次褚民誼先生發起全國體育會議謀體育之統一增推行之效力在此國難臨頭力謀自救之際確是要圖倘能不蹈他會覆轍重要决案政府逐次實行</p>
<p>而强國之基礎亦從此穩固雖然議案之執行責在政府而議案本身之切事宜有系統便於執行則此會議自身宜負責任作者與袁敦禮郝更生二先生受定方案之委託後經數日之考慮均主張編製方案須有組織有系統宜免散漫零星之弊大綱擬定請北平諸同志批評修正之後再行起草草成再請諸同志修改然猶恐所包不廣所見太窄於是鉛印草案百餘份分送各城體育領袖請其批評至上月二十二日徴得無數意見於是將方案略加擴充盡量容納之故此次之方案起草者雖祗有三人而參加意見者有數十人之多蓋事關全國不能不愼重出之也提案猶水中之魚蝦螺蛤方案猶河中之網無所不容作者整理提案時先將方案綱目摘出作爲各類名稱次依提案之性質歸入各類凡提案之無歸宿者則按其性質在方案之中另插要目以列入之開會時依方案之次序連同有關係之提案討論方案討論完畢提案亦以告終故此次會議之結果爲求得具體而有系統之方案而所有提案不過修正與擴充此方案之材料而已此次會議中之重要問題所待解决者約有數端</p>
<p>（一）行政之組織體育各級敎育行政機關若無體育行政人員推行視察所有方案所定課程標準等永無實現之希望</p>
<p>（二）體育與國術之調和從前研究體育者不談國術習國術者排斥體育兩方均屬錯誤實則國術不能　體育而體育不能棄國術希望此次會議得有合理这解决方法</p>
<p>（三）太極球運動太極球爲新發明之運動其功用與德國之藥球相仿勝從前之再典體操幾倍體育上當亦有相當之地位然國術家　歧視之此次會議中亦須平心討論得圓满結論</p>

<p>不驅日寇出我國境</p>
<p>决不生還以見國人</p>
<p>黑龍江省主席馬占山將軍代表田秀翹、上月二十九日、由黑省巴彦縣北東興鎭出發、於前日抵滬、向各界報告黑軍抗日情形、並定日内晋京、請求中央早日出兵、收復失地、田代表係日本陸軍士官學校畢業、現任黑龍江騎兵第二旅第五團團長、此次東北抗日之健兒也、記者昨晤田代表於旅邸、詢以東北最近抗日之情形、當蒙詳爲解答、時黑龍江省黨務指導委員吳煥章亦在座、告記者以黑省黨政軍之近况甚詳、茲記兩氏之談話如下、</p>
<h3 id="c116">田秀翹談話 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>數旬以來、黑軍消息沉悶、乃因軍用短波無線電機發生障礙所致、而日方乘機向壁造謠、擾亂聽聞、不曰馬主席陳亡、即云黑軍種種失利、此乃小醜慣技、不値一笑、然由此亦可窺見日本對我精誠愛國誓死抗日之馬主席的「敬羡欽畏」之一般心理也、至我軍自抗日以來、殊蒙國人推獎援助、京滬各界、海外僑胞、愛護尤深、馬主席恐國人懸念、特命兄弟南來、向各界報告黑軍抗日情况、並促中央早日出兵殲滅日寇、收復失地、拯我東北三千萬民衆的生命財產於水深火熱之中、以解倒懸、</p>
<p>日機施威數月以來、黑軍無日不在與日軍戰鬥中、茲略述梗槪、以告國人、黑軍此次在呼蘭以南、與日軍作戰二十餘日、士卒奮勇、人自爲戰、奮臂一呼、莫不以一當百、是以屢挫敵軍、莫不望風而逃、堅壁高壘、不敢越雷池一步、我方正擬乘勢殲剿、無奈敵方變更策略、屢用重爆炸機二十餘架、炸我黑省最繁榮之海倫、綏化、呼蘭、等縣、人民死傷載道、房屋倒塌無數慘不忍覩、我軍因缺乏防空兵器、遭受損失、爲愛護同胞及兼保存實力計、不得不自動放棄城池、移至郊野、繼續與日軍作戰、而日軍恐我軍圍剿、亦不敢入城焚殺搶掠、此乃兩全之策也</p>
<p>長期抵抗馬主席於六月二十日、欲與丁·李·兩司令聯絡、以圖大舉乃向上集塲·慶城·巴彦·等地移動、將該處之日軍擊退、我軍即佔領大靑山一帶爲根據地、以備長期抵抗、蓋大靑山乃一天險之地、所謂「一夫當關、萬夫莫敵」、而我軍又可掩蔽於千年未曾採伐之森林中、聞語而不見人、進可攻、退可守、日軍此時一籌莫展、雖日前以飛機偵察擲彈、亦毫無效果、現在日軍砲火不能加、炸彈不能施、其計已窮、而我馬主席所率部隊、又皆精勇異常、計有第一旅吳松林部·第二旅梁振鐸部·第三旅部甫忱部·第四旅鄧文部·第七旅才鴻猷部·共四萬餘人、而第二旅梁旅長、復兼民軍總司令之職、計所統轄民軍在三萬餘人、均屬槍械整齊、俱爲誓死禦侮爲國死敵的東北健兒、惟彈藥缺乏、殊爲可憾耳、</p>
<p>四次血戰日軍雖畏我馬主席如神聖、而恨之刺骨、野心未死、是以於七月十四日、日方之第十四師團、及第八師團之一部、用野戰重砲及飛機、掩護步騎兵、猛烈向我陳地總攻擊前後四次血戰、經六晝夜、我軍亦因生死關頭、堅守陳地、拼命應戰、驕橫之日軍、終被擊退戰事之激烈、較去年江橋之役、有過無不及、此役日軍死傷約千餘人、遺屍遍野、未經其自焚者、俱皆腐爛、臭氣難聞、馬主席爲維護人道起見、命皆掩埋於山下、我軍傷亡亦甚重、日軍受上挫折、不敢輕動、乃變更戰略、取包圍封鎖政策、我軍早悉敵計、盡則掩蔽於森林之中、或潛伏於靑紗帳之内、夜則出奇兵襲擊敵宿營地、又以小部隊襲擊、擾亂敵之大部隊、而不與敵作正面衝突、彼攻我退、彼退我攻、日軍應付困難、疲於奔命、加以靑紗帳起、江河汜濫、山邊一帶、交通閉塞、蚊蟻食人、日軍更不堪其苦、於七月二十五日左右、全數退至呼海路線、其企圖不明</p>
<p>馬氏决心馬主席晝夜奔馳、督率部屬、未曾少懈、且精神較前振作、常向左右云、余（馬自稱）居於繁榮之城市、安逸淸閒、反覺精神沉悶頺喪、每値露食野宿、乘馬奔馳於殺聲遍野之際、深覺心曠神怡、精神痛快、今與日寇戰於山邊一帶爲我四萬萬同胞爭人格、爲我中華民國爭光榮、生死早置諸度外、更不覺處境困苦、天下事無難易、只在立志之堅與否耳、馬主席又常至各部隊訓話勗勉部下矢志衛國雖戰至一彈一卒、亦必盡軍人之天職、不驅日寇出境　、决不生　以見國人、其部下官兵、念國難方殷、皆自動不要餉、相與積貯以作購彈藥之用、今雖處於郷地、而土氣之盛、不減於昔、名抱誓死殺敵救國之决心、與日寇周旋到底、</p>
<p>切望援軍此刻我軍彈藥雖缺乏、尙不足爲憂、所懼者乃敵方援軍源源而來、日見增加、而我方無一卒一矢一彈之助、若長此以往、牽延日久、敵方之根基鞏固、則我東北三千萬民衆、將死無葬身之地、而財產更無論矣、以往之咎、勿庸再議、今張主任效古人淸高之風、毅然引退、希望中央、速遴派賢傑、率東北之健兒、趁此靑紗帳未倒之時、義勇軍得勝之際、殺出關去、收復失地、還我河山、救我東北同胞於水深火熱之中、我東北民衆、人人皆願作前驅、效命疆塲、觀近來義勇軍之行動、可表示我東北民衆心理之一般也、</p>
<p>待機總攻丁·李·兩司令、現</p>
<p>在陵源·金溝·一帶、所部有三萬餘人、王德麟司令在横道河子、所部萬餘、馮占海司令在五常、所部七千餘人皆已聯成一氣、待機總攻、一舉殲敵、深望國人予以後方之援助云、</p>

<p>馮庭長裁决准惲保釋</p>
<p>捕房律師猶堅持不可</p>
<p>出法院時羣衆大歡呼</p>
<p>人心不死奸商應愧悔</p>
<p>愛國靑年惲蕙芳、因警告私販日貨之奸商被捕、解由第二特區地方法院、判决處徒刑二月、緩刑二年、旋經公共租界捕房以新閘路永昌煤號、前被血魂除奸團員抛擲炸彈一枚、炸傷號兪瑞樑、及山西路棉布公所所接炸彈警告信件、亦係惲蕙芳與蔡耀祖所爲、請求第一特區地方注院備文、於前星期四往第二特院、將惲提至捕房、並往派克路二零七號惲蔡寓所、搜獲手溜彈一枚、翌日解送第一特院、由捕房律師汝保彜根據刑法二八二條及三一八條對惲起訴、經馮世德庭長審訊之下、以被害人兪瑞樑未到、諭候改期再訊、惲蕙芳覊押各情、已誌本報</p>
<p>旁聽者絡繹不絕昨晨屆續審之期、承辦此案之中西探員、於八時半、將惲押解至第一特院第一刑庭雙方律師、亦相繼出庭、惟起訴之工部局、則加派該局代理主任律師甘鏡先到庭參加、而各界人士到庭旁聽者、則絡繹不絕、九時後、該庭已有人满之患、庭外尙擁擠不堪、約計當在五六百之衆、</p>
<p>兪瑞樑未曾到案九時半、馮庭長與汪首席檢察官及書記官升座、命法警將被告提至被告欄、先由汝保彜律師稱、兪瑞樑已往傅喚、兪亦親就傅票簽字、但至今尙未見其到案、不知何故次由一百　二十九號華探目報告往永成煤炭店傅兪情形、</p>
<p>第二特院不上訴馮庭長遂問惲蕙芳曰、第二特區法院對汝案如何判决、所判何罪、惲答稱、處我徒刑二月、緩刑兩年、趙琛律師並爲補充曰、該院係依據刑法三百十九條判斷、庭長續問曰、該案該汝及起訴人曾否聲明上訴、惲頻頻搖首、趙律師又爲答稱法捕房律師當時聲明、對於判决甚服、故未主張上訴、</p>
<p>擲彈是整個計畫問、該案汝有何種行爲、惲答、亦係以炸彈警告奸商茂昌洋布莊、問、此項行動、是否凡屬奸商、均須與以炸彈警告、且是否係整個計劃、惲即曰、然、馮庭長遂宣稱、本案與法租界之案有繼續關係、故對該案卷宗、本院認爲有調閱之必要、蓋此中尙有法律問題、而今日本案則不能進行審訊、還須延期、</p>

<p>惲蕙芳准交舖保李祖虞律師因即起立、請求准被告交保、庭長頷之、時捕房律師甘鏡先乃加以反對、謂本案關係地方治安、工部局對於交保一點、表示反對、趙琛律師以此點無反對必要、起而駁之、此時馮庭長已宣告裁决、本案改期一星期、候向第二特區地方法院調閱惲蕙芳案卷宗、惲蕙芳交殷實舖保、</p>
<p>捕房律師之抗告甘律師聞此裁决、續起聲請、謂依據刑事訴訟法第四百十四條、應提起抗告、在未將此抗告裁定之前、要求停止執行交保之裁决、馮庭長即告以交保未便抗告、而李祖虞律師則稱、依據刑訴法四百十五條規定、實不得抗告、甘律師復稱、刑訴法第四百二十條規定、法院可於抗告未裁定之前、停止執行、趙琛律師遂加以辯駁、謂該條條文係「得以裁定停止執行」旣有此「得」字、可見非必須停止執行、倘告訴人果有不服、儘可依四百十九條於三日内具意見書聲請</p>
<p>庭長命中止辯論甘律師續稱、捕房之所以反對交保、實因被告爲血魂團員、尙有同黨未獲、倘予保出、則該在逃同黨無弋獲希望、况猶有危害治安之虞、故不得不加以反對云云、李祖虞律師因將覊押之目的、詳加解釋、謂覊押一在避免逃亡、一在便利共犯、此外無覊押之必要、被告前經保出、並未逃逸、至謂蔡某如欲逃亡、亦不需俟被告保出後始逃、故捕房反對交保、未免過慮雙方辯至此、庭長以案經裁决、命各造終止辯論、並飭捕將惲帶往交保處、候具保手續齊備、准予保釋、</p>
<p>兩商舖代爲具保庭上准其交保之後、旁聽者均喜形於色、當由法警帶往交保間候保、時到庭願作保者有二百餘家、緣法院祇須殷實舖保、即由四川路保和堂及勞勃生路祥泰銀樓二字號、請趙琛律師書塡保狀、並由該二店李乾亨陳樹聲二君、袖出預携之圖章蓋上、並簽名負責、因法院向例、凡塡保單後、必須往該店對保一次、如此往返之後、値至十二時半、方完手續、惲蕙芳遂於掌聲雷動中、隨常州旅滬同鄉會代表王劍鍔等登一二零三二號汽車、直馳而出法院之門</p>
<p>惲蕙芳自譚家世據惲君言、世居常州、椿萱並茂、終鮮兄弟、惲氏一脈、祇此一人、於二年前到滬就商、初在民華印刷所、新近進山海關路聯華印刷所、自此事發生、聯華並無表示、在捕房中甚爲優待、並不受苦祇詢問口供而已</p>
<p>關於法律之斟酌當候保之</p>
<p>際、到院旁聽之各團體代表、擬請惲君於保出後至市商會報告在捕房情形、後因免得多事起見、遂打消此議、在本案未開庭之先、據聞法院方面有開會討論對惲案如何判决之提議、然記者親訪馮世德推事、據答謂並無其事、惟開庭之先、馮推事曾與捕房律師汝保彜作法律上是否聯續犯之斟酌、結果决定須向特區第二法院吊取案卷參考、</p>
<p>惲將返常州小憇至惲君出法院後之行踪、因欲避免愛國同志紛往慰藉、並恐反對份子加害起見、堅囑暫不發表、據云擬往常州故鄉安息、靜候法院審理、</p>
<p>工部局嚴加戒備工部局警務處則爲保護法院安寗、維持秩序起見、特調大隊武裝探捕三四十名、駕駛紅色大號警備汽車一輛、内裝機關槍一架、開赴法院門首、停於北浙江路東面之七浦路、車内探捕、則撥一部份分佈於法院大門内之甬路週圍、協助原有法警、担任警戒、並將院内各崗位、皆改爲雙崗、當時空氣、頗見緊張、致一般不明原因之途人經過該處、多暫駐足而觀、然俱知謹守秩序、始終無紊亂情况、</p>
<p>歡呼聲中出法院惲在司法警察辦公室由十時半候至十二時、担保店舖之保狀、由律師呈經馮庭長批准、始得回復自由、足甫離該室之閾、一　般欲覘志士丰釆者、無識與不識、爭先恐後、紛致慰忱、不期而將惲包圍、斯時鼓掌聲、歡呼聲、聞於四遠、復有攝影記者多人、手携快鏡、請惲留影畢、始由各團體代表伴之同登汽車、於歡呼聲中疾馳而去、</p>

<h3 id="c146">漢奸首領胡立夫或解京 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>溫應星談胡危害民國確實有據</p>
<p>偵緝隊昨日已將胡移解司法科</p>
<p>漢奸胡立夫、當日軍盤踞閘北時、勾通日人、組織傀儡機關、在日軍卵翼之下、魚肉民衆、無惡不作、市長吳鐵城、早經通緝有案、惟以胡好行踪殊秘、經公安局偵緝隊多方跴緝、結果始於日前晚間、在北四川路新雅酒樓捕獲、當晚經該隊盧隊長審訊一過、本定前日移解該局三科、惟因適値星期、故延至昨午、始行正式移解、詳情已誌本報、茲將昨日情形、分誌如下、</p>
<p>兩保鑣尙漏網記者昨訪偵緝隊長盧英、詢以胡犯被捕後、曾否有同黨截獲、據盧氏談、胡奸羽黨、當日軍退出閘北後、即已分批逃避外埠、惟胡犯本人、則尙秘密居滬、當經嚴密偵緝、始悉胡犯出入、平時每隨保鑣二人、以爲防範、惟當前晚在新雅酒樓捕獲時、則在塲者祗胡一人、而保鑣初未隨行、故被漏綱、當胡奸捕獲後、對所雇保鑣二人、亦已承認、惟謂係其親戚云、</p>
<p>溫局長主嚴懲關於胡奸被捕後之處置辦法、記者昨訪市公安局溫局長、據談、胡犯膽敢在日軍盤踞閘北時、在日人指使之下、成立所謂地方維持會、以及種種不法行動、試問胡犯是否事前曾奉市府命令、故其罪惡、實屬不容諱飾、關於處置辦法、本人對法律雖不熟悉、惟觀其罪狀、實屬危害民國、故無論如何、本人主張嚴辦、庶足以儆奸頑、通緝胡犯等係市府命令、是否將解送法院、或警備部、抑或須待市府命令、本人之意、仍須解送警備部發落、又悉溫氏昨曾一度親往警備部接洽、現聞中央方面、亦殊注意此事、故日内或將轉解中央發落、亦未可知、</p>
<h3 id="c147">被捕後之胡立夫（李尊庸攝） <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>胡奸被覊情形胡犯自被捕後、即覊於市公安局偵緝隊、記者昨往訪問時、曾往胡犯覊押處視察、胡居該隊副隊長室、踞坐床上、態度雖似鎭靜、惟面色則殊灰白、想見其内心驚恐之一斑、胡被捕時、本御白夏布長衫、時因天熱、胡上身只穿白汗衫、下身穿黑香雲紗褲、灰絲襪、黑緞雙樑鞋、身材魁偉、髮則略呈斑白、該隊對胡頗優待、除足上繫有鐐銬外、並無其他刑具、香烟茶水、不時爲之購備、故雖被覊、尙覺自由、</p>
<p>胡尙狡辯掩飾胡犯被捕後、雖自知罪不容誅、惟對人聲述、尙竭力强辯、據謂本人在閘北時、天地良心、實未作騷擾事件、當時閘北多廠、雖在戰時、貨物留存頗多、即如煤斤、亦達數萬噸之多、當時一部份日人、曾命余設法售出、而余則堅决不允、此等事件、儘可詢問閘北廠商、故中國人駡我漢奸、實不應該、若東洋人駡我漢奸、則我實俯首無辭、胡發言殊多、處處作掩飾、欲蓋彌彰、殊覺令人齒冷也、</p>
<p>昨午移解第三科前日適値星期、故覊押於偵緝隊、至昨午始正式移解第三科、胡由偵緝隊外出時、曾頻頻詢問家屬方面、曾否有人前來察視、並告偵緝隊中人、所有身上之金戒及銀錢、均可交往家中、並謂事已如此、留亦奚用、似對於昔日之行動、已深表懺悔、胡解三科拘留所後、態度尙頗鎭靜、惟曾求一切予以優待、司法科至下午並未詢問、大約今日上午、該科正式預審、待預審後、或解龍華警備司令部、如中央認爲案情重大、必要時或解京訊問、</p>
<p>胡奸自述履歷胡奸年齡籍貫、本報均已詳載、記者昨日訪時、胡曾自述其詳細履歷、據謂幼曾在溫州原籍私塾讀書、年十六、始來滬投考中國電報局、旋入戒酒會堂充西崽、復在英文夜校補習英文、得識英人牧師海和德、旋隨海轉往寗波裴迪學校研習、庚子拳亂時、海和德擬回國、故又伴同來滬、因此得入客利飯店任譯員、旋在該飯店識德醫生某、又同至北平、時拳亂未平、曾一度投效軍事、攻打拳匪、事平後乃來滬、廿二歲時、考入海關服務、旋奉調至鎭江、至　廿五歲、乃又返滬、始娶閘北甘姓女旋至漢任横濱正金銀行跑樓、至卅一歲辛亥革命武昌起義、乃入黎元洪部下張振武部、在長江一帶秘密工作、當時化名爲胡逸、嘗一度至鎭江、秘謀起義、事成後、乃又來滬、營軍裝業、旋又至漢口營業、約年餘乃再來滬、至是乃致力商業云、</p>

<p>憲兵關員爭執</p>
<p>近日長江輪私運烟土案、破獲者甚多、昨日招商建國輪進口、又經海關檢查員在該輪憲兵室内抄出大批烟土、發生衝突、亟將大槪情形、分誌如下、</p>
<p>搜出私土建國輪昨由長江開來上海、於上午十時至金利源碼頭、船方靠泊、旅客即上岸、至十二時十分、江海關檢查員到輪、搜查有無違禁物品帶來、檢查員先在各處抄查、未有所獲、後在隨輪憲兵之房艙内、抄出烟土四大提、總數有六千數百兩、値洋一萬數千元、當時無人承受、海關檢查員即將提取該土、入關報告、</p>
<p>發生糾紛在海關檢查員欲提取該項烟土時、船上之護航憲兵、即出而阻止、以查烟非海關任務、不令提去、而檢查員亦表示强硬、必欲强取該土、在輪憲兵、即時召集在滬停泊各江輪中之憲兵三十餘名、到建國輪對檢查員示威、而檢查員亦即至領江臺懸掛ＮＹ字樣之水警旗、船上發生重大糾紛、雙方幾致衝突、</p>
<p>碼頭戒備此事發生後、法租界捕房亦得訊、即派探捕至金利源碼頭、以此事發生在黃浦江内之商輪上、未便上船干涉、乃在碼頭上驅逐閒人、臨時戒備、十二時一刻起、至下午二時止、碼頭上起卸工作、寳全停阻、</p>
<p>水警到輪水巡隊見建國輪高懸水警旗、知船内已發生事故、即派長警一排、放輪至該船詢悉原因、乃上前勸憲兵勿予海員留難、其時局内船務科亦派員到船、居間調解、結果將抄出之私土六千餘兩、交水巡隊取去一面由海員檢查員報告海關令各憲兵、則各歸本輪、至下午二時半、一塲風潮、方始解决、惟帶土之正犯、已早聞風逃避、未曾獲到、</p>
<p>已獲巨土上次江安輪中、搜獲私土、已誌本報、茲悉江安輪内抄出之私土、總數有四十三擔之多、價値十餘萬元、當時水巡隊經三次搜檢、歷一夜方始運畢、又有江華輪來滬、亦搜出私土四千餘兩、</p>

<p>當我意外地在烽火山上（這同名是事後知道的）發現了幾尊礮，鬆弛的心情陡的嚴肅化了，於是迅速地架起寫眞機來和大的照了一張。</p>
<p>礮，一共是兩尊小的和一尊大的。大的是平視着横亘如帶的揚子江，安靜地蹲伏在水汀築成的地坑裏，四圍都有水汀的圍牆，牆上滿是深陷的彈窠（窠高約尺許，寬可六寸）彈的大小可從這求得。小礮是曝着陽光，仰着頭，狀似警犬。</p>
<p>在照的一霎間，一顆怪脆弱的心似受暴力震激，不停地在我胸前怦悸着。異樣的覺得自已是一個行跡　昧的間諜，是虛心的恐懼敵人發覺自已在做些什麽呢。可是我終於平安無事地照得了。我快活呀！快活得像火燒子彈房裏的子彈，無頭緒地向着亂草裏瞎射。但也驚惶得如同熱鍋子上的螞蟻，祇無可奈何地兜着圈圈兒。</p>
<p>在山上是一片黃土與亂草，盛夏的陽光是普遍地照臨在上面。且莫間有什麽避蔭地，就是小小的灌木都找不到的，因而並没遇見人。可是，我聽得隱隱人語聲了，發現礮坑邊的地道了，大槪地道裏很涼快吧？看守礮臺的人該在躺着談閒呢。</p>
<p>下山時，自已覺得依然是一個間諜，所以很怱忙地溜下來的。但是我在踏上寬坦街道時，反覺得滿身的不快樂，原因是後面並不見有人追踪而來，前邊也無人擋住去路·結果我竟這樣想着··假如我當眞是什麽間諜呢」？「假如······？」</p>

<p>— 芮禹成</p>
<p>溯自一二八的事變發生。滬上百業凋零。居民紛紛逃難。我也回到故鄉去。有一天傍晚。正偕妻兒們竚立門前。忽然來了一個落魄的少年。年約二十歲左右。精神疲憊。面有菜色。一望而知是個避難者。他蹣跚着走近我們的面前。陡然跪倒在地。一壁發出哀憐的聲音道。請先生救救我。避難人實在是無路可走。性命交關啊。我們起了同情心。便把他引入家中。問明原委。才知他是嘉定人。向在上海經商。滬戰忽起。生意停歇。他因擊念他故鄉的母親的妻兒。胃險回家。可是行至半途。就被日軍俘去。逼他在後方帮運子彈。怎奈他是孱弱的商人。那能這勞苦。加之飲食不周。鞭笞嚴酷。因此未過兩天。已經萬分憔悴。這一日正扛著彈藥在走。　地眼前昏黑。不知怎樣就暈倒路旁。等到蘇醒過來。才知自已正睡在一個紅卍字會的臨時醫院裡，再俯首一看。只見胸前衣襟上凝着一片鮮紅的血迹。他料想是在途中因咯血而暈倒。可不知由何人挽救到此。不久。醫生來診治了以後。腦經裏兀自淸醒了許多。便注視病室中其他的病人。大半都是傷兵。只有一個普通的病人睡在他的鄰近。有時隨風吹來一陳濃烈的煤油氣味。直剌入他的鼻觀。原來他憐牀的那個病人。是一個煤油行的夫役。周身的衣服。都時時放出煤油的惡味來。他起初嗅到這種異味。頗覺不耐。等到過了一週以後。倒也習慣成自然了。可是他急切地要會他的眷屬。也不有等待身體健全。便毅然離了醫院，但那時嘉定已被暴軍完全佔領。欲歸不得。而身邊分文没有。更無處能夠棲身。惟有沿途乞化。維持生計。他沿著鐵道信步行乞。這一日不覺到了我們的家鄉。我當時聽他這一番苦况。極端表示同情。凶又說是無處安身。以致流爲乞丐。我和女人便毫不遲疑地留他在我們家中暫住。等到停戰後再回家鄉。他見我們如此慷慷。非常感激。便說道。承蒙先生的盛情。收留了我。我就在府上當個僕役吧。但有一層。我工錢是不要的。不過每天要求先生給我四兩煤油。務求婚許。我聽了很覺詫異。就問他要四兩煤油做什麽。他不禁流下涙來道。我自從離開醫院。隔絕了那個鄰牀的病人。精神上就感到一種非常的痛苦。我始則不知何故。後來才想起這個原因。便將討得的錢去買了二兩煤油。盡性的吸它的氣味。那知一吸以後。神氣立刻增長。因此每天就非吸不可了。起初幾天。不過吸吸而已。那知過了幾天。又彷彿覺得不能過癮。竟然非喝不行。開頭僅喝一兩。後來逐漸增加。如今至少要喝四兩才可濟事。望先生原諒我。他這一種特殊的要求。使我半疑半信。但救人要救到底。便允許了他。可是我想想煤油是含有毒質的。如何能吃呢。自此我仔細的從旁觀察。果然見他每晚必吃煤油。而且吃過了便精神十足地來和我談天。就和有芙蓉癖者吸足了鴉片一樣。有時談到他的故鄉。他便凄然下涙。這樣過了一個月的光景。上海停戰恊定簽了約。日軍撤退了。我動身到了上海。他受了我女人給他的川資。也回到嘉定去了。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>前日我做了驅逐留東學生的幾句談言，隨連了君仁君露絲君與樊星南君的三封信，要我答復，他們信中大意，天然是反對我的主張，現在不到日本去留學他們偏說應該留學到日本去，我在未曾寫這復書以前，先要聲明兩句話　　一此次驅逐留東學生回國，是被日本人驅逐回國的，不是不佞驅逐的，　也不是我國政府驅逐的，　　一我主張不到日本去留學，不是說以前，也不是以後，是說九一八事變後，到日本侵略政策終了止、</p>
<p>三君是否爲過去的留日學生，或未來的留日學生或與日本有關，或與現在的留日學生有關，我亦不必加以追求，不過欲駁復他人的文字，須要認淸題目，看明文字，方可說話，我主張不到日本去留學，原是指明自九一八事變以後，到日本侵略政策終結時止，不應該到日本留學，</p>
<p>因爲我國本身的不長進，不能不到各國去留學，得到些相當科學智識，這本來我是承認的，但自滿淸以來，一批一批的留學生，到各國去留學的，何至千萬人，年數不下數十年，尤其是留學日本的學生居多，然而得到多少實實在在學問回來，貢獻祖國呢？噫！言之可歎，但其間不能盡怪留學生的不是，而政局的不穩定，政府的不能用盡其才，亦是其中原因之一，結果只買了幾個博士學士等等頭銜回來，一些没有用處，則留學生的價値已可槪見，</p>
<p>君仁君謂，帝國主義的國家，那一個不像日本，只有時機未到，没有將牠們的猙獰面目表示出來，（這個意思，三封信中差不多相同）這句話我也認爲有一部份理由，但是他國的猙獰面目，君仁君也承認未曾揭出，其實也曾經揭出過，但各國以後何時揭出，或揭出的面目，如何程度，恐君仁君也不能猜測而知罷，但是日本的猙獰面目，早已揭破，去年九一八事變後，不宣而戰，完全佔領了我東三省，還不算數，又垂涏我的熱河，並且有進窺平津之說，試問各國的面目，以後我却不能說，現在有如此猙獰麽？</p>
<p>君仁君的書中，又有一段文字，讀之令人又氣又可笑，不値我來一駁，且錄在下面，請讀者大家看看這樣妙文，日本人之恨中國人，等於中國人之恨日本人，（足下何由知之，足下恐亦是日本人乎）中國人之拒日本人，恐甚於日本人之拒中國人，（這是中國人的不是）然而從没有聽到一個日本人說（這是日本人的大度）··「我們恨中國人，我們永遠不到中國去，東三省的土地，我們不要了，在中國的日租界及一切權利，我們統統放棄了，我們與中國永遠斷絕關係」，我想日人雖愚，也不會說這句話，（這些話虧足下想得出來，高明，高明，）（未完）</p>

<p>— 奴</p>
<p>我們中國漁業的不發達，雖由政府保護不力，但是漁民缺乏科學智識，因陋就簡，不知改良，確是失敗的主要原因，若仍固步自封，不知改良，恐此一線生機，也將蹈絲業的覆轍而破產了，茲爲引起世人注意漁業起見，於是把電光捕魚法，寫在下面，</p>
<p>（一）魚的性質將白磁盤置於淺水草叢的中間，魚見了他，以爲是月兒的影，都跳躍入盤，這是魚喜光亮的證據，漁人裸體入海，不久，就有魚來歸附，這就是魚喜溫暖的又一證，我們旣知魚喜光亮和溫暖，則電燈具有這二項作用，我們儘可利用他，</p>
<p>（二）裝置魚陳在淺海的旁邊，四角立了四根木柱，柱高約一丈（入泥處不計），各柱相距一丈四尺，四周與底面都用篾竹圍着，陳底須與海底相距四尺許，再立四條鐵柱，以鞏固篾竹，這時輪廓已成，於是在陳的四面，開了一尺方的門二十幾個，門也以爲竹篾做成，交錯像倒鬚，使魚進了陳不能再出，陳中懸百枝電光燈一盞，燈泡須用二層玻璃做成，使受熱的一層，不和冷水接獨，以免爆裂，而外雇玻璃，最好用淡綠色，和水的顔色一樣，燈的外面，佈着鐵絲網，防大魚衝破電燈，陣底開一大約二尺方的洞，裝了關鍵，可以啓閉自由，下面圍了一個大網，這樣，漁陳完全告成了，</p>
<p>（三）其他設備每一漁陣的旁邊，應該附設魚棚，便於看守，如漁區距都市很遠，須自備引擎，供給電流，而運魚小輪，尤爲必不可少的設備，因爲帆船遇着逆風，便束手無策，及至風順，則又漁商雲集，市價暴跌，故不如汽船運送，較爲便利，</p>

<h3 id="c191">爲「復改良吃飯」一文答文君 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>自從不佞提議「改良吃飯」一文，在本刊發表後，似已引起讀者諸君的注意，而加以討論了，計先有叔夏君，繼而有其行君，對於這「改良吃飯」的管見，已有宏論發表，各紓卓見，自是欣佩，惟前日，（十一日）見有文君的「復改良吃飯」一篇妙文，拜讀之餘，覺得語有誤會，爰加伸述如下，藉答文君之雅意</p>
<p>文君文内云·「····我以爲一家之中，旣然有了患肺癆病的人，及其他有傅染病的人·事實上其餘的人，都應該格外的處處預防，改良吃飯，倒可不必····」誠然，如文君所說，亦有見地，不過玩彼語氣，似誤不佞所提議的「改良吃飯，」祗限於一家之中，這所見未免不廣了，須知不佞這個「改良吃飯」的提議，不僅是限於一家之中，就是大衆一處的公共機關，或團體之中，尤應該有這「改良吃飯」的必要，一家之中，倒還在其次哩。</p>
<p>文君又以不佞所謂「年來我國人，事事歐化」的一點，而加以非議，也不無誤會，他說··「····試問歐化在那裏？一切的一切，依然任人侵略，受人鼻息，所化的無非是社交公開啊·男女跳舞啊！一切的浪漫啊！···」誠然不錯，我國人的事事歐化，不過如此而已，安得不令人痛心！安得不使文君發極而甚至疑不佞對此歐化，亦表同情！則不佞豈敢。文君痛國人之歐化，如此而已，誠可謂有心人也。但是，事有好壤，所謂歐化，亦有可學與不可學，不可混爲一談。文君問我說··「什麽是歐化？更不知歐化是什麽？」可謂善問之至，本無置答的價値，惟旣蒙文君殷間，不忍拂其雅意，姑答之，尙祈文君聽諸。須知我之所謂歐化也者，當然是好的歐化，可以學的歐化，至於『什麽是歐化？更不知歐化是什麽？』這二句的問意，實是一而二，二而一也，歐化者歐美各</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>國風俗人情的榜樣也，我所以說「年來我國人，事事歐化」者，祗爲痛心於我國人，年來對於文君以上所說的壤榜樣，（但是，在學那些壤榜樣的人，却視爲好榜樣，）學的起勁，那麽，我的語意，就是說··「國人年來旣事事歐化，與其專學那些自以爲是的壤歐化，不如這吃飯的事情，也改良歐化，而改爲每人每菜的「分食主義，」似比較學那些壤的歐化，有利而無弊啊·」這層言外之意，祇好怪不佞當時太寳貴本刊的篇幅，未加闡明，而從簡略，致使文君誤會，而勞文君殷問，眞是意想不到，然而，文君的一番憂時雅意，實有多足矣！</p>

<p>— 欣奚</p>
<p>兄弟是一個學生對於社會是絕端没有涉足過的，原不配談甚麽改良社會問題。不過經不起貴會對於改良社會的熱誠，而且貴會的投稿權並不限於會員的，所以不自量的獻醜了。</p>
<p>敎育和社會的關係人人都知道的，不煩多說。學校可以比做許多工廠，而社會是一片大商舖，當然我們都是工廠裏出產的商品。没有一件商品不經過商店的，正像没有一個學生不進社會的一樣。至於我們的主顧呢？當然同樣是大千羣衆。</p>
<p>現在我們看一看我們的銷路，有多少學校的畢業生能夠有事體做？難道這碩大的社會裏每年挿進幾千個有限的學生而能說供過於求嗎？那麽像歐西各國有百分之九十五的識字者又怎樣安挿呢？這不能不說敎育的不得法。試調查一調查那些大中學畢業生研究農學的有幾個？工業有幾個？醫學幾個？其他實業幾個？和學文學法學政治藝術相比，眞是渺乎其微了。</p>
<p>前幾天南通紡織學校在滬招考，含弟林亦去應考的，據說投考者寥寥三五十人，又據該校負責人言··「去年該校畢業生二十餘人，而社會需要竟至幾倍。誰說亭子間裏大學生供過於求呢？</p>
<p>一二個月以前罷？報刊中委陳果夫先生提交中委會的敎育改革案說··「吾國自興新敎育以來，學校課程偏重文法藝術而忽視農工醫學各科，此種畸形發展故失業者漸增，造成社會種種不安狀態，同時又感人才缺乏，坐視建設事業於不進。」這種社會現像是誰都承認的，但是誰造成這畸形局面呢？辦敎育者固然應該負責而學者根本心理的謬誤自亦不能辭其咎的。這筇種心理是··</p>
<p>（一）吾國人向來以做官爲讀書唯一出路的，這種封建思想到現在還深入人心。</p>
<p>（二）一般靑年都未老先衰喜作無病之吟，或是風流自命，鑽情草木之中，以爲可以長此公子哥兒了其一身的，</p>
<p>（三）自負太大，視實業爲小道，不足以救國安民。</p>
<p>看了報載高等文官考試錄取的自願交還文憑，醉心政治者亦有些覺悟嗎？中國的政治舞台原是一朝天子一朝人，自問有挿足的資格嗎？醒醒罷！我們調轉口號··</p>

<p>— 林霞</p>
<p>這實在是中國敎育界患着癆症啊！怎算得是Ａ校的怪現象哩！</p>
<p>時候已經是八月三十一號了！Ａ校全體敎職員的聘書，還没有發出呢！因爲又換了校長了。</p>
<p>可憐半年變動一回的敎職員們，此憐猶未得着聘書，都禁不住内心焦急了！雖然有二三個已得了新校長的口頭預約券，還算不得十分穩定呀！</p>
<p>禀性圓活的，便輾轉去去託人，重向校長介紹，還向各方面去活動。結果固然操諸别人，兩腿不能不跑得十二分勤苦！賦性剛直的，只知道抱定「合則留不合則去」的主旨，解不得什麽呌活動！</p>
<p>校長呢！也着實爲難。好的老敎員，本想多留幾個。無奈上司的手條，薦函，如何敷衍？親戚，朋友的包圍，情難一槪拒絕。時間再也不能延擱下去了，最後，揀原有敎職員中，有介紹信最多的留聘二三位，其餘的一律辭却，校長的困難，這才解除了一小半。</p>
<p>好在賦性剛直的老敎員們，决不肯寡廉鮮恥，向校長責難。得着預約券不能實領的，也只有自歎運舛！</p>
<p>這呌做敎育界比各界「淸苦」！</p>

<h3 id="c194">瘟神 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 白匋</p>
<p>近來時疫猖獗，到處都閙着不安。市民們紛紛舉行太平公醮，大家誦經拜禱，焚燒冥錢紙箔，希望立刻就能將瘟神送掉。其實眞瘟神並不是什麽獰猛的鬼神，而是一隻小小的，人所熟知的飛虫。那隻飛虫便是天天擾亂得我們不寗的蒼蠅。</p>
<p>提起蒼蠅，誰都厭惡牠太髒吧？牠實在是一個傅播時疫的大瘟神。這位瘟神飛集於糞便垃圾堆之間，飽吸了腐屍爛物，這些腐屍爛物裏面充滿着無數的毒菌，例如霍亂菌，赤痢菌，傷寒菌，肺癆菌（即結核菌）等等，蒼蠅吃飽了這充滿毒菌的汚物之後，飛到我們家裏來，牠實在是一個貪食的小動物，見到我們的食物便停在上面，把從前吃下去的汚物一股腦兒都吐出來，再吃新發現的食物。而且，牠好嘔吐，時常把吃下去的，吐出來再吃進去，所以我們在多蠅的地方，常常見到壁上有蠅吐出來的汚跡。如果我們把蠅吐出來的毒菌吃下肚去，立刻就會生病。牠那副身體，除去兩隻翅膀之外，全身都披着鋼毛，尤以脚上最多，這些毛是傅染病菌最好的器具。有人計算過，一隻蒼蠅身上所帶着的病菌從四千四百到二十九萬幾千個之多，這些病菌之中，有那可怕的霍亂病菌，赤痢病菌，傷寒病菌，肺癆病菌，白喉病菌，脾脫病菌等等。</p>
<p>一個地方如果發現了時疫，幾天之内便會蔓延全市，這其中的傅播者，並不是鬼神，乃是蒼蠅，牠從這一家飛到那一家，從垃圾箱毛厠裏飛到人家的食物上來，便是在傅送那可怕的瘟病。所以我們要驅逐瘟神必先除滅蒼蠅。</p>
<p>蒼蠅的生殖力實在驚人。在夏天，天氣良好的時候，一隻蒼蠅從小蛋變成成虫，只需八九天。過三天之後，新出的蒼蠅便又會生子了。一隻蒼蠅從五月起到八月完止，以四個月計算，牠的子子孫孫是一九一，○一○，○○○，○○○，○○○，○○○，○○○個，大有殺不勝殺之勢。我們要好的防禦法是驅之於家室之外，是凡窗，門都用鐵紗關閉起來，使蠅無從入室。但鐵紗昻貴，一門之費即需二三十金，非貧苦人家所能享受。那末，用鐵紗罩把所有食物都罩蓋起來，切勿使蒼蠅在上面叮食。用蠅拍，或捕蠅器殺滅也是很有效的。至於驅滅蛆，可在糞便上灑石灰。城市中以垃圾箱最易招蠅　集，所以垃圾箱宜閉關，一切汚物如西瓜皮，腐爛飯菜等，不能任意棄在垃圾箱旁，以防生蛆。</p>
<p>秋天的小兒痢最可怕，每年死於小兒痢的嬰兒不知凡幾。這種痢症，大都是由蠅傅染來的。做父母的對於嬰兒的牛乳須注意，切勿爲蠅所叮。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Looking Out Over Beiping and Tianjin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, various newspapers in Shanghai have widely reported news that the Japanese are planning to invade Beiping and Tianjin, taking advantage of the internal troubles in our country. The Beiping correspondent for the French-language "Shanghai Daily" even stated, in discussing the Japanese army's intention to attack Beiping and Tianjin, "Some people formally recognize the so-called 'Manchukuo' before launching a fierce attack several times to scare away Zhang Xueliang. This plan is not surprising to us." At the same time, Japanese newspapers are exaggerating Zhang Xueliang's relationship with the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, loudly proclaiming the fallacy of so-called decisive action. All of this inevitably shifts our attention from the question of whether Wang Jingwei and Zhang Xueliang will stay or go to the situation in Beiping and Tianjin in the near future.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese, before each major action, have always disseminated serious news many days in advance, alternating between urgent and relaxed tones to numb the senses of the Chinese people. When there is an opportunity to exploit, they suddenly launch an attack. The Jinzhou Incident is one example of this. The atmosphere of invading Beiping and Tianjin has been created since the latter half of June, and a considerable period of time has passed. The nerves of the Chinese people have gradually become insensitive due to prolonged elastic stimulation. If there were no constraints from the general mobilization of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, the telegrams of Wang Jingwei and Zhang Xueliang's dispute would have been sent long ago. The fact that the Japanese will act is evident before evening. It can be confidently asserted that Zhang Xueliang cannot be allowed to spend several days in Beiping leisurely discussing his personal stay or departure.</p>
<p>Recently, the political turmoil in China has tended to ease. Zhang Xueliang's departure does not seem to be as the French newspaper said, waiting for a scare from the Japanese. How the arrangements are made when Zhang leaves is closely related to whether the Japanese will launch an attack at this time. In his interview with reporters on the 8th, Zhang stated that the reason for not resigning early was that he could not bear to lose the Northeast and not be able to recover it. Whether his words are credible is another question. If these words are indeed from the heart, then he is not as devoid of conscience as generally suspected. If Zhang can exert this conscience and prepare adequately for local security and step down when Mutō Nobuyoshi has not arrived in Shenyang and the Volunteer Army can restrain the Japanese actions, he would deprive the Japanese of another opportunity to launch an attack. This would be slightly more meaningful than sitting in the sorrowful city of Beiping, hoping to recover the lost territory. This is the minimum hope that we, looking out over Beiping and Tianjin, must place on Zhang. Several days ago, Washington reported that the Beiping mission had considered the situation in the event of an incident. The crisis in Beiping and Tianjin has been recognized by the world. If the Japanese's foolish thoughts of action can subside due to the joint monitoring of China and foreign countries, and the timing of their planned launch can be avoided due to China's proper handling, it would be fortunate for the Beiping and Tianjin areas. Otherwise, even as the French journalist said, Japan cannot escape the judgment of justice for its continuous aggression against China. Even if the spring of the power of public justice and sanction (referring to the complex international relations) is held to the point where it can no longer be tolerated, it can inflict severe punishment on the Japanese, but the Beiping and Tianjin areas will be unimaginable. This is why we hope that the Beiping mission can learn from the Shanghai Incident and quickly use pre-emptive measures against Japan.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Central Committee Discussion on Wang Jingwei and Zhang Xueliang's Resignations and Proposed Solutions <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Approving Zhang's Resignation as Director of Hebei Pacification</p>
<p>Approving Jiang's Proposal to Establish a Military Branch</p>
<p>Sincerely Persuading Wang and the Heads of Various Ministries to Stay</p>
<p>Drafting Various Points for Submission to the Central Standing Committee for Decision</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This morning, the Central Committee convened a discussion meeting attended by Ye Chucang, Chen Guofu, Chu Minyi, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Shuren, Shi Qingyang, Chen Lifu, Shi Ying, Ding Chaowu, Gu Zhenggang, Huang Jichen, Xiao Jishan, Guo Chunyu, Ju Zheng, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Wu Jingheng, Zeng Zhongming, Zhu Jiahua. Ju Zheng presided, and He Yingqin and Wu Jingheng reported on their efforts to persuade Wang Jingwei in Shanghai, stating that after arriving in Shanghai, on the 9th, they and other comrades went to Wang Jingwei's residence to meet with Comrade Wang Jingwei and conveyed the Central Committee's sincere intention to persuade him to stay. Various comrades also expressed their intention to persuade him to stay, but Wang's intention to resign was very firm, and there was no result. Afterwards, they visited repeatedly but did not meet him, and even when they met, there was no concrete expression. On the 14th, everyone went to Wang's residence again to discuss, and Jingheng relayed the situation of his discussion with Comrade Chiang Kai-shek in Wuhan, as well as Chiang's sincere intention to persuade Wang to stay. Wang then expressed that he could engage in Party affairs work or other positions in the Central Committee, but he did not want to return to the position of President of the Executive Yuan. After this consultation, we returned to Nanjing on the night of the 14th. Then, the Central Committee members thoroughly studied the issue of Wang Jingwei and Zhang Xueliang's resignations, first drafting a solution and then submitting it to the Standing Committee for a decision. The result was the following four points: (1) Regarding Committee Member Zhang Xueliang's repeated telegrams earnestly requesting to resign from the position of Director of the Hebei Pacification Office to take time to engage in inspections (result) Approving his resignation; (2) Regarding Committee Member Chiang Kai-shek's proposal that, given the importance of defense in Hebei, the Hebei Pacification Office should be temporarily suspended and a branch of the Military Affairs Commission established to strengthen overall control (result) Approving and quickly establishing the case of the Military Affairs Commission branch and submitting it to the Standing Committee for decision; (3) The President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the various ministries of the Executive Yuan continue to send telegrams or individual requests for resignation, and although repeated efforts have been made to persuade them to stay, the matter is of great importance and should be thoroughly discussed again (result) The Standing Committee should make another sincere effort to persuade them to stay; (4) Committee Member Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission proposed that Wang Shuhan, Wan Fulin, Zhang Zuoxiang, Zhang Qun, Han Fuju, Xu Yongchang, Wang Shuchang, Song Zheyuan, Bao Wenwei, Yu Xuezhong, Shang Zhen, Rong Zhen, Pang Bingxun, Shen Honglie, Tang Yulin, Jiang Bocheng, Liu Yifei, and Xiao Zhenying, totaling eighteen people, be members of the Military Affairs Commission branch, with Wan Fulin, Rong Zhen, and Jiang Bocheng as standing committee members (result) Approving, but the case of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission concurrently serving as the Chairman of the branch should still be submitted to the Standing Committee for decision.

<p>(Nanjing) It is learned that Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and Lin Sen will hold a meeting in Guling on Friday. Since Zhang Xueliang's resignation has been accepted, Wang is scheduled to take the train back to Nanjing after noon and fly to Guling on Friday morning. (Reuters Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Wu Jingheng Discusses Wang's Attitude <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Jingheng said that the crux of Wang's resignation lies in his dissatisfaction with Zhang Xueliang. Now that the Central Committee has approved Zhang's resignation and abolished the Ping-Sui Pacification Office, Mr. Wang has always been courageous in taking responsibility and is indeed a pillar of our Party. In view of the current national crisis, the Central Committee is earnestly trying to persuade him to stay, and all parties are looking forward to it with great anticipation. He will not likely retire in isolation. According to recent consultations, Wang has agreed to return to Nanjing on the 16th. However, he stated that since the Central Committee has approved Zhang's resignation, he is determined not to return to the post of President of the Executive Yuan, in order to gain the trust of the people and to apologize to Mr. Zhang. After returning to Nanjing, he will report the reasons for his resignation to the Central Committee and await its decision. The Central Committee relies heavily on Wang and has not given up the hard work of persuading him to stay. Chiang's attitude is especially sincere, believing that no matter how difficult Wang's situation is, the Central Committee should find a way to overcome it. Chiang is temporarily unable to come to Nanjing because of his heavy responsibility for suppressing bandits and the urgency of the situation. Zhang's resignation this time is indeed determined, because North China is the North China of China, and Zhang's personal advancement and retreat will not have an impact on the overall situation. After Zhang leaves, there is no successor for the time being, and Chiang should bear full responsibility. For the convenience of command, a military branch will be established in Beiping, and all military leaders in North China will participate. A list of seventeen committee members is being drafted after discussions among Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, and Beiping and will be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for discussion and decision. What the whole country should strive to do now is to resist aggression. The situation in Rehe is precarious. If Tang Yulin has any conscience, he will not hand it over. Reports that Tang intends to resign and detain the Volunteer Army are heartbreaking. However, we believe that we should not be pessimistic about the Northeast. If the people's hearts do not die, the country will not perish. The Japanese, relying on violence to destroy international credit, are digging their own graves. Our final victory lies in the final efforts and determination of the whole country, and so on. (Special Telegram, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Zhang Instructs His Subordinates with Three Matters <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang's subordinate generals came to Beiping from the defense area to hold a meeting, requesting Zhang to consider the national crisis and withdraw his resignation. Zhang personally attended and delivered an address, earnestly instructing them not to cause internal strife due to his personal stay or departure, and instructing his subordinates with three matters to work hard for the country. First, no matter what the future situation, they must always remember the welfare of the Party and the country and take it as the premise of all interests. If they do not adhere to this point, the future will be vast and full of dangers, and my subordinates do not want me to value personal interests and disregard public welfare. Therefore, those present today who have such thoughts are not my good friends. Second, since I and you have already dedicated ourselves to the country, we must not repeat the old mistakes of warlords occupying territory and seeking self-respect, causing the future of the Party and the country to be endangered by one person's stay or departure. You must also understand your own position, so you should work hard for the Party, the country, and the people with loyalty. If you are thinking for me personally, then you should not be swayed by emotions. I also hope that you can use a clear mind and fair vision to deal with the crisis at hand. Third, for the sake of the Party and the country, I and you must think twice before acting, and we must be calm and composed so that all internal and external affairs can be carefully considered to seek a timely solution. Moreover, the responsibility for the Northeast issue, which is added to the soldiers of our Northeast Army, is even more profound. Therefore, we should all go to the national crisis together and never be troubled by personal grievances and gains. In order to practice the above three things and work hard to serve the country, you must strengthen yourselves and abide by discipline to fulfill your military duties. You must not rely on force and use it as a ladder to promote personal interests, and so on. (Special Telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Party Headquarters Office in Nanjing held the 39th Memorial Week at 9 a.m. on the 15th. Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, He Yingqin, Wu Jingheng, Li Ciwen, Xiao Zhongzhen, Xiao Jishan, Shao Yuanchong, Miao Peicheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Daofan, Zheng Zhannan, Chu Minyi, and more than 600 staff members attended. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting, and Shao Yuanchong reported that we should establish the basic laws of the nation quickly in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. With this common and abiding legal norm, we can determine the goal of our efforts, and we can deal with emergencies fairly. However, the effectiveness of the legal system should be universal, not just to restrain a part of the people. Those who create and implement the law should also abide by it. The reason why the Qin Dynasty was able to conquer the six kingdoms and become strong was due to the strict implementation of Shang Yang's legal system. If the current situation in our country can establish a spirit of the legal system, then talents can be concentrated, the organization can be strict, the nation can not be scattered, and everyone can be neat and serious, with a unified force of norms, and then we can talk about political reforms. All aspects of culture, knowledge, academics can be changed accordingly. We can only change our current situation by following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, abiding by the legal system, and vigorously implementing the spirit of the legal system.

<p>Dream of Seizing Power Ultimately Proves Illusory</p>
<p>Von Papen Begins Organizing Political Program</p>
<p>New Parliament to be Summoned on Schedule</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 15th: It has been learned that Nazi leader Hitler, during his meeting with President Hindenburg on Saturday, actually identified himself with Mussolini. Hitler reportedly told the President, "I want to gain the same position that Mussolini occupied after his march on Rome." According to semi-official sources, the government had been trying to allow the Nazi Party to occupy a commensurate portion in the federal government. The failure of Hitler's talks with the President on Saturday is entirely the fault of Hitler himself and his advisors. Parliament will now be summoned within the period stipulated by the Constitution, at which time the Papen government will undergo a vote of no confidence.</p>
<p>National Society, Berlin, 14th: The German people and public opinion now feel that the National Socialist Party has lost the opportunity to organize a Nazi Party government or control the German political situation, and they fear that this opportunity, once lost, will never be recovered. Apart from the Nazi Party newspapers, all newspapers say that Hitler can no longer hope to receive Hindenburg's favor, because Hindenburg's invitation for Hitler to join the government was already an excessive favor. Even the far-right newspaper "Kreuzzeitung" says that Hindenburg's position is perfectly reasonable, because Hindenburg has no reason to follow the demands of one party and become a puppet himself. On the other hand, Von Papen, due to Hitler's failure, has developed unlimited hope, so he has now begun organizing his political program in order to win the support of the majority in the new parliament. Von Papen has also decided to convene a cabinet meeting within the next week to discuss the economic crisis, paying particular attention to the unemployment problem.</p>

<p>Datong, Tokyo, 15th: With the special session of Parliament only one week away, various political parties are busy discussing parliamentary strategies. The Minseitō is scheduled to hold a meeting of its executives on the 16th to determine its general attitude. However, the party has adopted a quasi-party attitude since the previous session of Parliament and will continue to support the government. The government will also generally adopt the Minseitō's proposals, such as plans to smooth out finance, relieve rural areas and small and medium-sized businesses, and implement rural civil engineering projects extensively, generally adding a Minseitō flavor. Therefore, the Minseitō will definitely approve it. As for the Seiyūkai, it is currently conducting discussions centering on President Suzuki. All decisions will be made by the General Affairs Committee on the 17th and the Executive Committee on the 18th. However, there are still soft-line and hard-line factions within the party. The soft-line faction advocates self-restraint, such as President Suzuki, Minister of Education Hatoyama, and Tokonami Takejirō. Although they express some dissatisfaction with the government's emergency rescue budget of only 150 million yuan, they believe that it has fulfilled its final responsibility and the best possible path in these extraordinary times, so they advocate first approving it and then discussing countermeasures. The hard-line faction believes that the Seiyūkai decided on a budget of 500 million yuan this year, but it has been reduced to 150 million yuan, and no means are being sought for the central clauses of the resolution, such as smooth currency circulation (i.e., monetary expansion policy), which is extremely irresponsible. Therefore, they advocate putting forward a motion of no confidence and overthrowing the cabinet in one fell swoop. This faction is led by Kuhara and Mori, and most rural members support it, making the situation somewhat chaotic. Furthermore, the Kokumin Domei (National Alliance) of the Adachi faction is different from the Seiyūkai and Minseitō. It does not have preconceived notions about this session of Parliament and adopts a "right and wrong" approach to policy issues. However, the opinions of the executives are that the lukewarm Saitō cabinet cannot be expected to do anything, and they advocate that a more thorough rescue is needed. Therefore, the activities of Adachi, Yamamichi, Nakano, and Kiyose are particularly noteworthy.</p>

<p>Detained by Portuguese Customs</p>
<p>Risk of Causing Negotiations</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lisbon, 14th: An incident occurred here today that may strain diplomatic relations between Spain and Portugal. Portuguese customs discovered three boxes of weapons being shipped to the Spanish Embassy and detained them. One of the boxes fell and broke, leading to the discovery. When Portuguese authorities inquired at the Spanish Embassy, the Spanish Ambassador replied that they were samples of goods entrusted to the embassy by a French arms and ammunition factory in Spain to be forwarded to the Portuguese government. The factory wanted to sell 30,000 rifles to the Portuguese government for use by the Republican Guard. The Ambassador presented a letter from the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs describing the three boxes of weapons for the Portuguese government to review. The letter stated that the three boxes contained a total of twelve rifles and light machine guns, and 1,600 bullets. However, rumors spread that the Spanish Embassy was secretly shipping weapons to support the Portuguese opposition party, causing great excitement among the people. The authorities have now dispatched police to strictly protect the Spanish Embassy.</p>

<p>Maintaining the Status Quo Until 1936</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Makes Concessions to Japan</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 14th: The new Russo-Japanese fisheries agreement was announced after being signed yesterday by Karakhan and Japanese Ambassador Hirota. The main content is to maintain the status quo until 1936. Currently, Japanese people lease 393 fishing areas in Soviet territorial waters. According to the new agreement, only 60 areas need to be publicly tendered for lease after the lease term expires, and the remaining can be automatically extended until 1936. Japanese fishing companies can operate with peace of mind with this guarantee, while the Soviet state-owned fishing grounds have also obtained the right to recover fishing areas producing a total of 5 million poods (equivalent to 180 million pounds) annually without bidding, an increase of fishing areas producing 3 million poods annually compared to the current number, which is roughly equivalent to the current Soviet production volume of 50,000 poods. Therefore, the agreement can be called a truce in the Russo-Japanese fisheries dispute. As for the interpretation of the 1928 treaty, it is said that negotiations are still ongoing.</p>

Furthermore, sales of soybeans and other agricultural products from the three eastern provinces have decreased greatly in foreign markets, resulting in a large reduction in farmers' purchasing power. Commercial investment in the three eastern provinces in 1931 decreased by more than 50% on average compared to the previous year.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Northeast Righteous Army Uses Funeral Procession to Attack Japanese Troops <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Japanese General Domoto Picnics in Haicheng</p>
<p>Attacked by Righteous Army, Seriously Wounded</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: This time, the Japanese warlords have relied on their violence to forcibly occupy the three northeastern provinces, carrying out massacres, arson, and looting, doing everything. Therefore, the people of various places have risen up to organize righteous armies for self-defense. The righteous armies' method of fighting against the Japanese does not involve digging trenches, drawing battle lines, or building fortresses. They specialize in guerrilla warfare to attack the Japanese army, and strive to avoid frontal conflicts with the Japanese army. They often use encirclement tactics to go behind the Japanese army, and when the Japanese army turns around to attack, the troops ambushed in front of the righteous army launch a coordinated attack. In this way, encircling from the front and rear, the Japanese army has never failed to suffer a disastrous defeat. Tanks are unable to move forward or backward, losing their effectiveness. Heavy artillery is difficult to maneuver, making it impossible to deploy. Because the righteous army is dispersed, airplanes find it even more difficult to identify targets and cannot drop bombs. Even if they reluctantly drop bombs, it is ineffective. Therefore, the Japanese army really has no way to deal with the righteous army.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Huang Yuzhou, Commander-in-Chief of the Liaodong Righteous Army, and His Handwriting <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Japanese General Domoto held a picnic with various company commanders in a village near Haicheng a few days ago. After drinking, he became arrogant and self-important. The righteous army heard this news and launched an attack on the Japanese army in order to capture this wicked warlord alive. Therefore, a certain commander of the Tenth Route recruited more than twenty elite, determined soldiers, and gave them secret instructions. They all wore sedan chair clothing, posing as porters, carrying a white wooden coffin in front. The commander pretended to be a filial son, carrying a pennant in front, acting as if he were mourning. The Japanese did not suspect anything. Even Domoto was unaware of the deception and continued to drink wildly. When the coffin-carrying team approached, the porters deliberately made a commotion. The filial son prostrated and begged for peace and quick departure. The Japanese laughed when they saw this. Domoto also couldn't help but smile, extremely despising the lack of unity of the Chinese people, thinking that even a funeral procession was noisy, so other matters could be known. Before long, Domoto and others even watched this amusing scene while drunk. Who would have thought that this group of porters suddenly took out quick-firing guns loaded with bullets from the coffin and fired a volley, while the so-called filial son actually took out a pistol and acted as the commander. At that time, the Japanese company commanders panicked, unable to grab their guns in time, and many were shot dead. Although Domoto was protected by many people, he struggled to escape with all his might. It is said that he was still seriously injured. Some say that Domoto has died, which is a rumor based on this incident. Our brave soldiers took advantage of the chaos of the Japanese army to fight and retreat, and none were harmed, which was fortunate. The Japanese are extremely secretive about this matter, not allowing it to be revealed, so few people know about it. Domoto often said in private conversations that after decades of military service, he never expected to be ambushed like this, and that the righteous army was truly terrifying.

<h3 id="e79">The Fourth Day of the Continuing Trial of the Noulens Case <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Police Witnesses Appear in Court</p>
<p>On the morning of the 15th, the Jiangsu High Court continued to try the Noulens and Wang De Lee case of endangering the Republic of China in the first criminal court of the Jiangnan Local Court. The judges present were as before, and lawyer Chen Ying also attended. The witnesses who arrived were Ross, Western Inspector of the Shanghai Police; Gaul, Western Detective; Merle; and Deng Hailin and Pan Zongyue, Chinese detectives. After the judges took their seats, they brought Noulens and Wang to the court and seated them in the dock. First, they summoned witness Gaul for questioning. (Judge asked) Did the police make a clear list of all the evidence items seized from the three iron boxes found at No. 49 Shangjing Road, No. 123 Sichuan Road, No. 66 Hede Road, and No. 77 Xihuayuan Road? (Gaul replied) All have lists, which can be read. (Asked) What was the situation when Noulens and Wang were arrested? (Answered) On June 15th last year, the police learned that No. 49 Nanjing Road was one of Noulens' secret organizations, and asked the child who looked after the house, named Pan Ada, about Noulens' whereabouts. According to Pan, the appearance and movements of Noulens were similar to what he described when Noulens was arrested that afternoon, and Pan pointed out that this was the person. Wang De Lee arrived at Room C30, No. 49 Nanjing Road, at 4:00 PM, and took the key to open the door on his own. He did not know that there was someone in the room, so he was also arrested. When searching for evidence in the room, Noulens was present, but Wang De Lee was not. The police asked Noulens about his nationality, age, and where he came from to Shanghai, but he refused to answer. They also asked him if he was familiar with Wang De Lee, and if Wang came here to talk to him. He said that he was not familiar with him, and that he did not come here to talk to him. They also asked if the women's clothing in the iron box belonged to Wang, and he denied it. The keys to the three iron boxes were all marked. The keys to the first and second boxes were taken out of the third box. The third box was opened by a locksmith using force. There were documents in all three boxes. In the third box, there were 800 US dollars, plus 23 dollars, 150 Japanese yen, and 6 yuan and 6 jiao in Chinese silver coins, divided into four packages. Noulens said that the money was deposited by someone else, and that the person who deposited the money had left Shanghai. Twenty-seven keys were found on Noulens, which were placed in a wallet separately. Several of them were the same as the post office mailbox keys. The police department's chief of police affairs, Givens, took them to the post office to compare them one by one with the mailboxes he had prepared. Next, Ross was asked. (Asked) Were you present when Noulens and Wang were arrested and when the boxes were opened to search for evidence? (Answered) Because it was my vacation, I was not present. (Asked) Is there a list of the evidence found? (Answered) Yes, it is being typed in the court right now and can be submitted immediately. In addition to the documents and deposits in the box, there were also two passports, one Canadian and one Belgian. Next, Merle was asked. (Asked) Were you present when Noulens and Wang were arrested? (Answered) I was not present when Noulens was arrested, but I was present when Wang De Lee was arrested. When Wang came to Room 130, No. 49 Nanjing Road, we closed the door and sat inside to wait for him. Because Wang had left a note on Noulens' desk, saying that he would come here around 4:00 PM that afternoon. When the time came, he came as agreed. He was extremely surprised when he opened the door and saw the situation. When asked if he knew Noulens, he said he did not. When asked why he was here if he did not know Noulens, he said he had taken the wrong road. (Asked) Were you present when the boxes were opened? (Answered) The boxes were opened and inspected at the police station. I was present. There were many silver coins and documents in the box, which were mostly recorded on the list. Next (Asked) Deng Hailin, where are you from? (Answered) I am from Xiangxiang, Hunan. (Asked) How many years have you been in Shanghai? (Answered) Five years. (Asked) What do you do in Shanghai? (Answered) I am a detective. (Asked) Did you become a detective at the police station as soon as you arrived in Shanghai? (Answered) Yes. (Asked) Today we are asking about the Noulens case, and we are calling you to court to testify. You must tell the truth. (Answered) Yes. (Asked) Were you present on June 15th last year when Noulens was arrested? (Answered) Yes, I went with the Western Detective. In addition to the Western Detective, there was also a Chinese detective No. 155 who went with us. (Asked) When the keys were searched, were you present? (Answered) Yes, but I was guarding outside Room C. I did not go inside. They searched the details inside. I don't know. (Asked) After arresting Noulens on Sichuan Road, did you go to search the rooms on Hede Road and Xihuayuan Road? (Answered) Before Noulens was arrested, I was secretly following Noulens on Sichuan Road to monitor his actions. After Noulens was arrested, I did not go to search the rooms on Hede Road and other places. (Asked) Were you present when the iron box was opened at the police station to inspect the evidence in the box? (Answered) I was not present at that time.</p>

<p>In answer, and brought a book and manuscript paper. At this point, the judge ordered Deng to submit his book for review. Noulens then suddenly stood up and said, "Please pay attention to the court. Deng's report did not exist before today's discovery. Please record it in the minutes." (Judge) "Noulens, this is irrelevant. You have a statement, wait until later to say it." Noulens (replied) "On the indictment, the mailbox is No. 205, and then it was corrected to No. 206. Now I don't ask which number it is, but I ask to see the evidence documents of the Communist Party found in the box." (Judge) "The witness's words have not yet been asked. It is not too late for you to see the evidence after the witness's words have been asked." Noulens (replied) "I still have something to say. I have a statement to make to the reports of Gaul, Merle, and Ross." (Judge) "Wait until the witness's words have been asked before you say it." At this time, witness Pan Zongyue arrived in court. (Judge) "Pan Zongyue, where are you from?" (Answered) "I am from Shanghai." (Asked) "Where do you work?" (Answered) "I am a Chinese detective No. 155 at the Shanghai Police Department."

(Answered) "There were two large handfuls." At this point, the judge ordered Deng to leave and then summoned Gaul again. (Asked) "Gaul, are you sure that the post office mailbox is No. 205?" (Answered) "I don't remember clearly, so I can't answer immediately." At this point, the judge ordered Gaul to leave and immediately summoned Noulens. (Asked) "Noulens, do you think what the witnesses said today is correct? Do you have any opinions to express? You can say it as much as you like, but don't be chaotic." Noulens (replied) "First, please note that on the indictment for the mailbox, did detectives watch over it in the past?" (Asked) "That is irrelevant." (Answered) "On the indictment, secret agents were assigned to monitor the mailbox. Now, according to the witness, he still doesn't remember clearly. Please note that the court has not yet proven the mailbox." (Asked) "Now, we are asking you if you have any objections to what the witnesses said. You must answer this point first. Don't drag things out and waste time." (Answered) "I want to express my opinion on what Gaul said. According to the indictment, the registered person for the mailbox is either Haier or Ellison, not Noulens. Please pay attention to the court." (Asked) "Now we are asking you if what the witnesses said is correct. You can discuss other things later. First, answer this point. After the witness's problem has been resolved, the problem with the indictment can be raised again." (Answered) "The court teaches me to express my opinions. I request that the documents and evidence be presented, but the court refuses. Please record it in the minutes." (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e82">◎ The Tiger Plague is Rampant in Shandong Province <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Deaths Continue in the Plague Area</p>
<p>No One Carries and Buries the Corpses</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Recently, the tiger plague has spread in various parts of northern and western Shandong Province, causing many deaths. The worst case is in Lijin City, where shops in the city streets dare not open for business, and most residents also close their doors and stay indoors. Looking at the streets, there is no trace of people. There are two hospitals in the city, but their directors have also died, causing their partners to disperse and close down one after another. Coffins are sold out, and the dead have no way to be encoffined. The county government informs that those who die of the plague must be carried out and buried within a few hours. No one is willing to serve as the funeral procession, the mourning musicians, or the pallbearers. It costs ten yuan for each corpse carried from the city to the suburbs for burial. Those who engage in this business do so at the risk of their lives, often burying people before burying others. Next is Zhanhua. Since the beginning of August, the tiger plague has occurred, causing many deaths in various places. Soldiers of the 59th Brigade of the stationed army have also died from this plague. It is heard that two soldiers have died in the brigade headquarters. The situation in the 117th Regiment is even more severe. After abdominal pain, they immediately faint and can die in just two hours. In order to prevent the spread of the tiger plague, Zhou Xiaoyi, Deputy Brigade Commander of the 59th Brigade, has ordered the officers of each department to gather the soldiers under their command to explain the methods of epidemic prevention and to telegraph the division headquarters to issue a large number of epidemic prevention drugs. County Magistrate Zhuang Shouchong is working hard to guide the people in epidemic prevention to prevent the spread. Huxian, Beixiang, and Huji areas have also discovered the tiger plague. Patients vomit, have diarrhea, or convulsions. The symptoms are dangerous and there is no cure. In the Huji area, hundreds of people have died in the past five or six days. The urban area has also discovered this plague, with six or seven deaths. In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the county government has convened epidemic prevention meetings for several days and organized an epidemic prevention committee, which will go to various villages to provide relief. Yidu has also recently discovered the tiger plague, especially in the urban area. According to a reliable investigation by the county Public Security Bureau, there have been more than 170 deaths from the tiger plague in the city. Also, people from Changqing reported that cholera (i.e., cholera) has been discovered in the southeastern township of the county, causing many deaths. The situation in Niujiaogou Village is even more severe, with the number of deaths accounting for one-half of the entire village. Even one person who is infected will infect the whole family, and the whole family will die. In order to avoid infection, no one carries and buries the corpses. Patients are numerous in dozens of nearby villages. Chinese medicine practitioners in the countryside are helpless. People are uneasy, agricultural work is abandoned, and the fields are barren. The autumn harvest is reduced, and the people's livelihood is extremely difficult. (August 14)</p>
<p>◎ Northeast Postal Workers Arrive in Jinan</p>
<p>Talking About the Hardships of Escaping Danger and Entering the Customs</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since our country implemented the blockade of the postal service in the Northeast, the tyrannical Japan has instigated the puppet state to privately set up a post office. However, all the old postal workers, with a strong sense of patriotism, were unwilling to be driven by the enemy and planned to enter the customs as a whole to seek another livelihood. However, the Japanese learned of this in advance and dispatched puppet police to patrol the post office and the vicinity of the staff dormitory day and night. Anyone who wanted to move out was arrested and subjected to extreme torture. The patriotic postal workers had to disguise themselves as merchants and farmers and mix into the customs. In recent days, more than 1,500 people have gathered in Tianjin. There are also those who were arrested halfway and their whereabouts are unknown. All the postal workers who have entered the customs have been assigned to work in the post offices in Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai. More than a dozen postal clerks have arrived in Jinan and have been properly settled and started working. The Jinan Post Office has specially organized a temporary reception center for Northeast postal workers to receive postal workers who continue to come to Shandong. People have been sent to the station every day to welcome and receive them. At 7:30 this morning, 97 postal workers arrived in Jinan on the 9th train from Tianjin-Pukou. After getting off the train, they were led by the reception staff to the post office to rest and eat. According to the representatives Qin Yunzhang, Yang Yushan, Huang Dengge, and Chen Zhongxiu, a total of 100 postal workers came to Jinan this time. Three people were left in Tianjin due to illness. The 97 people who actually arrived in Jinan were all workers and clerks who had been serving in Yingkou, Jinzhou, Liaoning, and Andong. The puppet government organized by Japan originally planned to take over the post office on August 1, but we received an order from the national government on July 20 to stop work. The Japanese heard the news and immediately sent military police to the bureau to force us to resume work and promote and increase salaries to buy people's hearts. We all refused to be intimidated and lured and disguised ourselves as ordinary people and merchants to escape into the customs. If we were careless on the way, we would be arrested and subjected to extreme torture. Some were even shot by them. We entered the customs by land and sea. Those who traveled by land took the Beining train and were severely inspected and questioned by the puppet police along the way. A slight oversight would lead to falling into the tiger's mouth. Once, someone held a "Daoxiangcun" card to prove that he was a merchant of that company. The difficulties along the way can be imagined. Those who traveled by sea went to Tianjin from Yingkou or to Shanghai from Dalian. The Japanese forced the postal workers in Yingkou to sign a condition that the Japanese would recruit new workers and the old employees would act as instructors to teach all the work procedures to the new workers before they could leave. Fortunately, our government had already blockaded the postal service in the Northeast at that time, and the number of letters received every day was small, so there was not much work. Therefore, the new workers could easily learn to do it. After a few days, they said that they were familiar with the procedures, so we took the opportunity to leave the place. However, the inspection was extremely strict when boarding the ship from Yingkou. We still did not dare to call our colleagues postal workers. We don't know why several colleagues were arrested by them. We didn't dare to rescue them either. We don't know where they are now. No matter how many colleagues there were on the ship or train, no one dared to talk to each other, pretending not to know each other. Even if we saw our colleagues being forced away, we didn't dare to speak up. It is the so-called daring to be angry but not daring to speak. Now we are lucky to have escaped from the tiger's mouth and returned to our country, but there are still thousands of colleagues and 30 million compatriots in the Northeast who are being killed and ravaged by the tyrannical Japan every day. We hope that the people of the country will rise up and rescue them. The work location of our arrival in Jinan has not yet been designated, so we can only wait for the assignment. All our families have been abandoned outside the customs, and their survival is unpredictable. It is also heard that when the postal workers arrived in Tianjin, each person received five yuan from the donations of various groups. There was not much left after arriving in Jinan, and the post office work was urgent and could not be obtained, so we had to sit and eat nothing. We urgently need the relief of all sectors of society. (August 14)</p>
<h3 id="e83">◎ The Lingbi People's Uprising Expands <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Tong County Sends Troops to Defend Against Rioters Crossing the Border</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Residents of Youji, Fifth District, Lingbi County, northern Anhui, recently planned to demand that the county government return the tobacco tax they had paid. They gathered a crowd to riot, destroyed the entire district office, beat public officials to death, and kidnapped township chiefs. Jiang Dingwen, commander of the Second Army stationed in Bengbu, summoned the Lingbi County Magistrate to Bengbu after receiving a telegram to inquire about the truth and sent personnel to the scene of the incident to investigate in detail. Unexpectedly, the people's uprising expanded more and more and was about to invade the Jiangsu border. The Lingbi County Government could not resolve the situation, so it invited impartial people with some reputation in the local area to persuade the people in the district, but to no avail. It is now heard that the rioters have increased to more than 4,000 people and claim that they will eliminate those who have harmed the people in the past. It is estimated that they have occupied Dali Ji, Yang Shan, Wang Ji, Yu Gou, Yang Tong, Jiu Ji, Shili Dian, Zhang Da Lu, Feng Jia Miao, Huitang Gou, You Ji Shang Zhu Jia, Yugou Chaoyang and other places, resulting in the abandonment of agricultural work and no one to care for the autumn harvest. All traffic between Lingbi and Tongshan has also been destroyed by the rioters. The Lingbi County Police Force is afraid that the rioters will seize its firearms and has detoured to the Shuanggou Town on the border of Tong and Lingbi to temporarily avoid them. The Suining County Police Force in the Lingbi and Suining border is also on alert, but they all feel that they are outnumbered and fear that they will be difficult to resist. The Tongshan County Government, according to the request of the Eighth District, specially dispatched a cavalry team led by Guo Yubiao to Shuanggou Town to garrison against unforeseen circumstances. Guo sent someone to the city at noon on the 13th to report that the people's uprising in Lingbi was caused by the oppression of local bullies. The people used the excuse of resisting the tobacco tax to confiscate most of the self-defense firearms in various villages and gathered thousands of people with a powerful momentum. The police force in the county was unable to resist and retreated to Shuanggou Town on the 11th. That night, 13 self-defense guns in the Baoyu within the Shuanggou West Jiu Li were forcibly taken away by Xie Guangming, a resident of the Baoyu. The Yang self-defense guns in the Gaozhuang, Qili, were also looted. It is also heard that the Lingbi County sent local gentry to persuade the people, but to no avail, and the situation became more serious. At present, the rioters are only 20 to 30 miles away from Shuanggou. Once they invade, how should our team deal with it? Therefore, we sent a telegram to ask for instructions. The Tongshan County Government was afraid that the rioters in Lingbi would cross the border and riot, so it telegraphed the Provincial Government and the Security Office on the 12th to ask for instructions on how to deal with the situation. It received a reply on the 13th, which read: (1) Magistrate Yang Jianwen telegram received. I have telegraphed Chairman Wu of Anhui to quickly order a stop. You should still properly prevent it and do not neglect it. Chairman Gu Yuan. (2) Magistrate Yang Jianwen Jianwen telegram received. If the order of Tong border is violated, use force to stop it and report the situation to Li Mingyang at any time. Yuan County Government, according to the telegram reply, immediately sent another company commander, Han Deping, with 60 police soldiers to assist.</p>
<h3 id="e84">◎ Bandit News from the Border of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Wu Qi's Bandit Gang Invades Wuhe</p>
<p>Li Chenggong's Gang Flees to Haoxian</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The banditry in Anhui Province has not been eradicated after years of suppression. Recently, the banditry situation at the border of Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui is still extremely rampant. The situation of suppressing bandits is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Border of Jiangsu and Anhui: The areas of Xuyi and Sixian in northern Anhui are close to Hongze Lake and adjacent to Jiangsu, with crisscrossing waterways, and have always been a breeding ground for bandits. The major bandit Wei Yisan's gang has been rampant between Jiangsu and Anhui for several years. Previously, the 25th Route Army Liang Guanying's troops repeatedly encircled and suppressed the bandits, causing them great damage. Recently, Liang's troops were transferred to Anhui to suppress the communists, and the gang became rampant again between Jiangsu and Anhui. Bandit leader Wu Qi led a crowd of five or six hundred people to run amok in the Xuyi and Wuhe areas. A few days ago, they successively occupied Huaining Town, Fushan Town, Yangtai, Liutai, Zhaotai, Dingba, Daliuheng and other towns and villages in Xuyi, looting more than two hundred rifles from the local militias, and committed all kinds of atrocities such as burning, killing and looting. Recently, they have even invaded Wuhe County. Song Zhinan, the magistrate of Wuhe County, immediately sent the county's reserve team to block them, and they arrived on the south bank of the Huai River. On the morning of the 12th, the county police exchanged fire with the bandits across the river. Knowing that there was preparation, the bandits immediately retreated to Xuyi. The Wuhe County Government has now telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government requesting that troops be sent to suppress the bandits severely to ensure local security.</p>
<p>Border of Henan and Anhui: The three gangs of notorious bandits Li Chenggong, Liu Laoqi, and Wei Quezi in eastern Henan recently took advantage of the autumn harvest season to gather more than a thousand people and occupy the border area of Shangqiu, Zhecheng, Luyi, and Haoxian. The long-distance telephone lines of each county were cut off, and news was therefore isolated. Many people fled. Zhang Zhankui, the brigade commander of the 14th Cavalry Brigade stationed in Guide, upon receiving the report, led his troops to Qiukou on the 8th, and sent the 3rd Company to suppress the bandits in Liuqiao and Qiukou. The bandits initially resisted stubbornly, but after Zhang's troops bravely charged, more than ten bandits were killed on the spot. The bandits then fled in panic to Songji to the south of the border between Hao and Shang, and the Wanglou and Liqiao areas. Zhang's brigade pursued them. That night, the bandits tried to flee west from Songji. After Zhang's brigade used machine guns to strafe them, the bandits fled to the Songyanji area of Haoxian County in Anhui. In this battle, more than fifty bandits were killed, more than a hundred men and women were rescued, and a great number of spoils of war were seized. (14th)</p>

<h3 id="e86">◎ The Yellow River is Tense in Both the Upper and Lower Reaches of Shandong Province <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Continuous Autumn Rain Makes Rescue Difficult</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Continuous overcast and rainy weather has caused the Yellow River's water level to rise again. Moreover, the autumn flood tide is rapid and has strong scouring force, making both the upper and lower reaches tense simultaneously. In the upper reaches, the large slippage at Liuzhuang, on the border between Hebei and Shandong, directly impacts the official office. Hemp sacks are being thrown to protect it. The water level at Lisheng Village has risen by 1.7 cm, and at Qishilibu by 3.4 cm. At Lisheng Village, due to the rapid rise of the water, the heavy slippage is pouring into the fourth, sixth, ninth, and tenth embankments, and the work on each embankment section is heavy. The fifth embankment has already collapsed with the water level, and the head of the sixth embankment has entered the water. A wooden pile in front of the embankment has been broken. The slight slippage at the seventh embankment of Zhukou is being protected. In the lower reaches, the embankments at Huimin and Wangzaojia are collapsing, damaging the embankment base and causing the loss of embankments. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, together with Gao Daofu, the magistrate of Huimin County, supervised and led the civilians and soldiers to desperately throw hemp sacks and stones to protect the embankment foundation. Today, another 5,000 hemp sacks and 400 ropes were transported from Jinan to Wangzaojia for use. Zhang Lianjia telegraphed the provincial government today to report that it can be guaranteed that there is no danger. At Damajia in the lower reaches, the water has risen by 3.6 cm. The newly built embankments are all stable. The water level at Luokou rose by 2.2 cm this morning and another 8 mm in the afternoon, reaching 29.77 meters. (August 14th)</p>

The patrol chief of the town's police station, upon hearing the news, immediately ordered the police to escort them out of the territory to avoid disturbance. Unexpectedly, the police returned midway, and the men and women went to Dawan Township on their own. At about 10 o'clock, they landed at Dawan Township and robbed more than ten families, including the head of Dawan Township, Zhu Bosheng, and fled fully loaded, with losses of about a thousand taels of silver. Afterwards, Township Head Zhu reported the incident to the Shuangfeng District Office, which in turn reported it to the County Government and requested an arrest.</p>

<p>Drinking Tea Leads to Murder: Sun Quanlian, a native of Ningbo, Zhejiang, opened the Wan Changxiang Foreign Iron Shop on Dongxin Road outside Guangfu Gate. He had four sons. At 8 a.m. on the morning of the 15th, Bai A'gen, aka Bai Xiaoyan, who opened the Bai Rongxing White Iron Shop in Zhoushanbang, Guangqin District, was formerly an apprentice at Wan Changxiang. Recently, he had a dispute with Sun in the same industry due to jealousy. He invited Sun Quanlian and Sun's second son, Dongsheng, to the Dongsheng Tea House to discuss the matter. Unexpectedly, after a disagreement, Bai A'gen punched Sun Dongsheng in the waist, hitting a vital point and killing him on the spot. Quanlian, seeing this, immediately reported it to the police station of the Second Public Security Bureau, who arrested the murderer Bai A'gen and took him to the bureau for interrogation before transferring him to the general bureau for trial. Tian San Tu Tu Zheng Xi Laoliang reported to the County Court and requested an autopsy. At 2 p.m., Prosecutor Shen, accompanied by Wang, the coroner, went to perform the autopsy. The autopsy revealed that the deceased Sun Dongsheng had indeed died from injuries. After the autopsy, he ordered the family of the deceased to prepare a coffin for burial and wait for the Public Security Bureau to send the murderer to the court for further investigation.</p>
<p>Huayu Ferry Destroyed Midway: The China Hengyu Steamboat Company, under the Gongyun Bridge outside the North Gate, has a branch office to facilitate passengers getting on and off the ship. At about 2 p.m. on the 9th of this month, the Huayu Ferry of the Xicao class of the branch office, as usual, sailed from Wuxi to Cao. When passing the Wuqiao branch office, the branch office did not have any passenger tickets sold, so it was assumed that there were no passengers on board and it continued to sail. Unexpectedly, at that time, there were three female students, Wang Xiuying and Qian Huizhen, waiting on the shore to take the ferry to Xinlu Bridge. When they saw the ferry sailing past, they shouted to stop the boat and questioned the branch office. The branch office said that since Wang and others had not purchased tickets, how did they know that they needed to take the ferry? Therefore, there was a disagreement in the language. However, in order to comply with the customer, the ferry was still ordered to stop. However, Wang and others refused to board the boat in anger and walked away. The next day, when the ferry passed Xinlu Bridge, many villagers suddenly blocked the ferry from sailing and questioned the reason for not taking the three women. The captain of the ferry, Xu A'mei, explained in a gentle manner. As a result, the villagers proposed the condition that the Wuqiao branch office should be closed down and a verbal apology should be made for the loss. The ferry then made a false promise to pass. Afterwards, the ferry came to the city and reported the situation to the company. Qian Weiqing, the manager of the company, telegraphed Qian Chongqing in the village to explain the matter. In order to avoid conflicts in the village, the ferry was ordered to temporarily detour to Dongfeng Bridge behind Xinlu Bridge. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 13th, when the ferry was passing Dongfeng Bridge, many villagers blocked and provoked trouble again, and crossed wooden rafts in the bridge hole. Jiang Hanqing, the cook of the ferry, seeing this, used a bamboo pole to push away the wooden raft. Unexpectedly, the villagers, including You Zibing, waded into the water and boarded the boat, smashing all the glass windows. The remaining villagers threw yellow stones at the boat, causing passengers Gu Fugen and cook Jiang Hanqing to be injured. Later, one of the perpetrators, You Zibing, was captured and sent to the Second Public Security Bureau along with the injured. After a preliminary trial by Bureau Member Liu, yesterday (14th), he prepared a document and sent it to the County Public Security Bureau to wait for the transfer to the court for trial.</p>
<p>Smuggling of Opium by Local Merchants Discovered: The Fifth Public Security Bureau outside the North Gate, Jiangyin Lane, discovered Xu Yongsheng carrying opium in front of the Shihe Silk Shop on Bei Dajie on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, and seized fourteen taels of opium and one tael of opium paste. He was taken to the bureau for interrogation. It is reported that the opium was sold in the Zhao Tea Shop under the bridge. In addition to operating a tea business, Zhao often travels back and forth between Shanghai and Wuxi to secretly transport opium, which sells well in urban and rural areas and earns a lot of profits. Xu Yongsheng, originally named Wang Rensen, who was detained the day before yesterday, is from Hutang in Xicheng. At that time, he was carrying opium and passing by the Shihe Silk Shop when he was discovered by Ge A'lan, who smokes red pills. Because he failed to take the opium, he reported the incident to the police. After a preliminary trial by Bureau Chief Peng, he was transferred to the County Public Security Bureau for trial yesterday. It is also reported that Zhao has established three opium trafficking agencies in Wuxi, one in a tea shop under the bridge, one in a Shikumen near the Old Jufeng Garden, and one in his home in Changan Bridge, which have been operating until now without being detected. It is hoped that the public security authorities will pay attention to it and clear the opium.</p>

<p>Jiangning Designated as an Autonomous Experimental County: Jiangning County is located in the capital city. The county's political facilities should be a model for the whole country. At the time of active implementation of autonomy, in order to seek the most ideal county autonomy, it is most appropriate to use Jiangning as an experiment. A certain important person in the central government suggested to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and advocated the establishment of the Jiangning Experimental County Design Committee to plan everything. Chairman Gu also believed that it was necessary to establish a model first in preparing for the autonomy of various counties and expressed great sympathy for this suggestion.

<p>Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Corps Warns Yilongxiang: Yilongxiang, a Jingguang grocery store in this port, received a letter from the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Corps saying that recently, stores in Zhenjiang have opened and sold sealed enemy goods. Such willingness to be a subjugated country is deeply regrettable. The Corps has achieved results in its work in Shanghai. Now, the general group has sent people to investigate and found that the company has been sparing no effort in selling enemy goods. It is hereby warned to quickly seal up unsold enemy goods and make a quick statement, otherwise the Corps will use the most severe means to deal with it. It is hoped that you will be aware of the danger. A hand grenade and a follow-up letter are attached, etc. The company was surprised to read this letter and has reported the situation to the industry association and asked it to forward it to the Provincial Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to send someone to check whether there is any violation of the regulations on banning enemy goods. It is willing to accept severe punishment.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Conference Preparation Process <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Peng Baichuan, Guo Lianfeng</p>
<p>(I) Origin</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year, when the University Council was first established, it recognized the importance of national physical education.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, organizational changes soon occurred, preventing any achievements from being made. In July of the eighteenth year, the West Lake Exposition in Hangzhou initiated the National Games. The Ministry of Education intended to use the opportunity to convene a National Physical Education Conference in Hangzhou. The association was requested to prepare for it on behalf of the ministry and Mr. Chu Minyi was hired as the head of preparation and Mr. Yuan Dunli and Mr. Huang Zhenhua were hired as the preparatory committee members. Originally, it was scheduled to be held in Hangzhou in September before and after the National Games. Later, because the National Games were postponed to April of the nineteenth year, the Ministry of Education happened to convene the Second National Education Conference around the same time. The work was heavy and it was feared that it would be difficult to handle both. Therefore, it was decided to postpone the conference. At this time, Mr. Chu Minyi went to Belgium to participate in the competition, so the convening of the conference was suspended.</p>
<p>In April of the eighteenth year, the National Government promulgated the National Physical Education Law. Several years have passed and it has not yet been implemented. Although the Ministry of Education and the Training Supervisory Department have consulted several times on the research and discussion of implementation methods, the problems were too many and it was deemed inappropriate to make a hasty decision without careful discussion by experts. In recent years, national public physical education and school physical education have been declining, and the world's physical education trends are also changing rapidly. If we cannot understand the trends and consider the needs of the people, we must quickly formulate and implement physical education guidelines and standards to serve as a guideline for the implementation of physical education in the country. Otherwise, promoting physical education will be nothing more than empty slogans and, at best, will only repeat the mistakes of others.</p>
<p>When national disaster occurred, the dispirited spirit of the people became even more apparent. Comrades, in view of the crisis of the country, believed that promoting national physical education was necessary to revitalize the national spirit and jointly save the country. Director Chu specially reiterated the previous proposal and sent a letter to the Ministry of Education requesting the convening of a conference. Thereupon, the ministry drafted the standards and number of members, together with the budget estimate, and submitted it to the thirty-fourth Executive Yuan meeting, which resolved to pass it and convene the conference in mid-August of this year. The purpose of this conference is not only to discuss practical physical education issues, formulate implementation plans, and standardize training guidelines, but also to cultivate a healthy national physique and cultivate the national spirit of wisdom, benevolence, and courage. Its mission is even more significant.</p>
<p>(II) Organization of the Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>After the Executive Yuan approved the convening of the National Physical Education Conference in August, the first task of the Ministry of Education was to select and appoint preparatory committee members. In order to concentrate various talents, it appointed major figures from all parties, hoping to explore an implementation plan that suits national conditions and adapts to trends. Therefore, Mr. Chu Minyi served as the chairman, and Mr. Zhang Zhijiang, Zhou Yawei, Wu Yunrui, and Huang Mingdao served as members. The relevant主管 personnel of the Ministry of Education, Section Chief Guo Xin Song, Section Chief Gu Shusen, Section Chief Li Zheng, and Baichuan, were also added as members. Later, because Section Chief Guo requested leave and Section Chief Li took the post of Principal of Beijing Normal University and could not return to Beijing temporarily, Counselor Chen Shizhen and Section Chief Zhong Lingxiu were added as members. It was announced on June 16th. Regarding the organization of the preparatory committee, it was originally divided into four sections. Later, because the power was not easy to unify, the system of general manager was adopted. Under the general manager, there were two sections for documents and reception, with several staff members, so that they could easily communicate with each other. The staff of this committee were appointed by the Ministry of Education, with Lianfeng as the general manager and Mr. Yi Kejun as the editor-in-chief of the conference daily. Mr. Gu Liangjie, Huang Longxian, Weng Zhida, Huang Wenqi, Wang Linggen, He Bolie, Gao Hongtu, Jin Guisun, and Wang Zhan served as staff members of the document section. Shi Wei, Zhang Yuanxun, Tu Gang, Shu Chushi, Zai Zefan, Wei Xuezhi, Jia Guoen, Zhu Shusen, and Zou Fengji served as staff members of the reception section. They started working in June.</p>

<p>(IV) Work of This Committee</p>
<p>I. Staff Meeting: After the Ministry of Education appointed the staff of the Preparatory Committee by ministry order, the first staff meeting was held on June 21 to assign work. The important resolutions are as follows: (1) Staff Dai Zefan is responsible for drawing the design of the committee's badge, and Staff Weng Zhida, Huang Longxian, and Gu Liangjie are responsible for drafting the manual. Staff Shi Wei is responsible for contacting the printing company. (3) Staff Tu Gang of the committee's budget is responsible for reviewing it and requesting the Ministry of Education to submit it to the Accounting Office. (4) Assigned the duties of the document section staff, including four people for meeting records, three people for editing the conference daily, two people for sorting proposals and preparing the agenda, and the general manager will assign people to draft, receive, and send documents at any time. (5) Assigned the duties of the reception section staff. Staff Shi Wei will be in charge of administrative matters, Staff Tu Gang will be in charge of accounting matters, and Staff Zhang Yuanxun will be in charge of all conference matters at the venue and dormitory. Three people will be in charge of dormitory reception, and four people will be in charge of venue reception, divided into two groups. Two people in each group will be in charge of registration and receiving audience tickets, and two people will be in charge of venue reception and distributing proposals and printed materials. (6) Contacted the Central Hospital to arrange for the health of the members.</p>
<p>(II) Contacted the Lihgishe Society for the venue and dormitory. The venue selection was quite painstaking. The distance between the members' accommodation and the venue was too far, which was not only inconvenient for traveling back and forth and wasted transportation costs, but also made it difficult for the staff to take measures. The difficulties felt during the first and second education conferences must be avoided. Therefore, it was decided to contact the Lihgishe Society to negotiate the lease of the auditorium and dormitory dining halls, etc. All of these have been negotiated, and Director General Huang of the society has agreed to make all the facilities available to the members as much as possible. (III) Handled the reduction of ticket prices for members' rides. After several contacts with the Ministry of Railways, all kinds of difficulties have been eliminated. The Ministry of Education has distributed the discount certificates to each member for their use.</p>
<p>(IV) Made badges. The style of the badges worn by members and staff has been handed over to the Standard Sports Equipment Company to manufacture 200 silver embossed badges and 220 silk ribbons. The company has sent representatives to deliver them. The style is very beautiful and can be distributed and worn during the meeting.</p>
<p>(V) Sorting and printing of proposals. As of August 13, more than 210 proposals have been received. However, the text format of the proposals is very inconsistent. Therefore, the committee will first make a preliminary sorting and classification. As for merging and revising, it should be handled by the review committee of the conference. The staff of the committee are stepping up their work to print the proposals separately so that they can be distributed to each member during the meeting.</p>
<p>(VI) Members are enthusiastic. The names of more than 110 members have been reported to the committee. Nanjing, Qinghai, Jiangsu, Chahar, Yunnan, Gansu, Jiangxi, Qingdao, Anhui, Shanghai, Guizhou, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Hebei, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hubei, Suiyuan, Guangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Hong Kong have all sent representatives to attend the conference. The remaining provinces, such as Shanxi, Ningxia, and Rehe, have sent letters stating that they cannot send representatives.</p>
<p>(VII) The Standard Sports Equipment Company and Liangyou Sports Goods Manufacturing Co., Ltd. will send domestically produced sports equipment to the conference for display and have agreed on the display methods. The committee will sincerely welcome any domestically produced sports equipment that is sent to the conference for display.</p>
<p>(VIII) During the conference, in order to allow members to understand the national physical education situation, survey forms have been printed and distributed to national and registered colleges and universities and education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to fill in the physical education overview forms for reference during the meeting.</p>
<p>(IX) In past conferences held by the government, members have suffered from too much feasting. Most of the members of this conference are physical education experts. Therefore, the method of entertainment for members is mainly sports, and it is planned to ask the Film Censorship Committee to collect films on sports and national disasters for screening at the conference.</p>
<p>(X) The committee plans to use the various facilities of the Central Sports Field to allow the members of the committee to practice and perform as much as possible.</p>
<p>(XI) In order to arouse the members' interest in national martial arts, the committee has negotiated with the Central National Martial Arts Hall to schedule performances.</p>
<p>(XII) In order to allow celebrities of the Party and the country to express their opinions on national physical education, the Ministry of Education has separately sent letters to various celebrities to come to the conference to give speeches on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The above is just a summary of the major points. I hope you can give us your guidance.</p>

<h3 id="e100">The Drafting Process of the National Physical Education Plan <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Wu Yunrui</p>
<p>Recently, the government has been seeking the unification of national politics and education and has held national military conferences, national financial conferences, and national education conferences, etc. The intentions are very good. However, due to the repeated internal and external troubles and the instability of the political situation and economy, the resolutions are rarely implemented, which is a pity. This time, Mr. Chu Minyi initiated the National Physical Education Conference to seek the unification of physical education and increase the effectiveness of promotion. At this time of national crisis, it is indeed an important plan to seek self-rescue. If it can avoid repeating the mistakes of other conferences, the government will gradually implement important resolutions.</p>
<p>And the foundation of a strong country will also be firmly established from now on. Although the responsibility for the implementation of the proposal lies with the government, the conference itself should be responsible for the relevance and systematicness of the proposal for easy implementation. After Mr. Yuan Dunli and Hao Gengsheng were entrusted with the task of drafting the plan, after several days of consideration, they all advocated that the drafting of the plan should be organized and systematic to avoid the disadvantages of being scattered and fragmented. After the outline was drafted, the comrades in Peiping were asked to criticize and revise it before drafting it. After the draft was completed, the comrades were asked to revise it again. However, I was still afraid that the content was not broad enough and the views were too narrow. Therefore, more than 100 copies of the draft were printed and distributed to physical education leaders in various cities for their comments. On the 22nd of last month, countless opinions were collected. Therefore, the plan was slightly expanded to accommodate as much as possible. Therefore, although there were only three drafters of this plan, dozens of people participated in the opinions. This is because it concerns the whole country and cannot be taken lightly. Proposals are like fish, shrimp, snails, and clams in the water, and the plan is like a net in the river that accommodates everything. When sorting out the proposals, the author first extracts the outline of the plan as various category names, and then classifies them according to the nature of the proposals. If the proposals have no destination, the author inserts other items in the plan according to their nature and lists them. At the meeting, the plan will be discussed in the order of the plan, along with the related proposals. When the discussion of the plan is over, the proposals will also come to an end. Therefore, the result of this conference is to obtain a concrete and systematic plan, and all the proposals are only materials for revising and expanding this plan. The important issues to be resolved in this conference are approximately several:</p>
<p>(I) Administrative Organization: If there are no physical education administrative personnel in the physical education administrative agencies at all levels to promote and inspect, the curriculum standards, etc. specified in all plans will never be realized.</p>
<p>(II) Harmony between Physical Education and National Martial Arts: In the past, those who studied physical education did not talk about national martial arts, and those who practiced national martial arts rejected physical education. Both sides were wrong. In fact, national martial arts cannot be divided from physical education, and physical education cannot be abandoned. It is hoped that this conference can have a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>(III) Tai Chi Ball Exercise: Tai Chi Ball is a newly invented exercise whose function is similar to the medicine ball in Germany, which is several times better than the previous Swedish gymnastics. It should also have a considerable position in physical education. However, national martial artists discriminate against it. It is also necessary to discuss it calmly and reach a satisfactory conclusion in this conference.</p>

<p>The Magnificent and Splendid National Spirit Fellowship Society</p>
<p>Comprehensive Arrangement of the Grand Auditorium</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the National Athletic Meet, in order to cater to the members' meals and lodging, dispatched personnel to negotiate with Mr. Huang Renlin, the executive secretary of the Society. It was agreed to borrow the grand auditorium as the venue for the congress and use all the dormitories for the members' accommodation. This arrangement places the venue and accommodation in the same location, saving travel time and indirectly increasing the efficiency of the meeting. The Society is located east of Huangpu Road, facing Zhongshan Road, making transportation very convenient. Its three palatial new buildings, with vermilion bricks and green rafters, are magnificent and splendid, and are famous new structures in the capital. The auditorium is located in the northwest. Its construction was proposed by the Women's Comforting Soldiers Association, which donated eighty thousand yuan from surplus funds raised for comforting the troops to the Society for the purpose of building the auditorium to commemorate the meritorious deeds of the soldiers who quelled the rebellions. The intention is excellent. The exterior of the auditorium resembles a palace, while the interior is a stage-style lecture hall. The lower level serves as the venue for sports conferences, the upper level consists of superior box seats, and the top level is the projection room. It is said that meetings will be held during the day, and various sports films will be screened in the evening to meet the members' needs for observation and entertainment, truly achieving two purposes with one action. The exterior of the auditorium is surrounded by flowers and a road lined with green cypresses. The short grass is like a carpet, and the capital's famous tennis court is located there, surrounded by lead netting and equipped with perfect facilities. Sports members can try their hand at tennis during breaks from the meeting to relax. As for the interior of the venue, due to the Society's cadre training class currently holding its graduation ceremony, arrangements cannot be completed until the afternoon of the 15th.</p>

<p>Huang Mingdao Sends a Representative to Attend</p>
<p>Jiang Xiangqing Also Serves as a Representative of the National Physical Education Association</p>
<p>Huang Mingdao, director of the Chinese National Physical Education Association and manager of the Ta Da Bank, enthusiastically promotes physical education and spares no effort. He has held important positions in past Far Eastern and National Games, especially during the 8th Far Eastern Games held in Shanghai, when the revolutionary army was rising and there were no funds available for the meeting. At that time, Huang was the chairman of the Economic Committee of the congress, and he relied on his efforts alone to raise tens of thousands of yuan from various parties to enable the congress to be successfully completed. As the Ministry of Education is holding a National Physical Education Conference, Huang has also been hired as a member of the preparatory committee. He originally intended to come to Beijing as soon as possible to support everything, but due to illness for nine months, he could not fulfill his wish. Therefore, he sent a letter to the Ministry of Education appointing Jiang Xiangqing as his representative to attend. In addition, the Chinese National Physical Education Association noted that some of the proposals at this conference were closely related to the Association, so it sent a letter to Chairman Chu Minyi, requesting that Jiang Xiangqing also be a representative to facilitate various consultations when necessary.</p>
<p>Experts Join Group Meetings</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th - After the preparatory meeting, committee members and experts held a discussion. Chairman Chu and the committee members proposed that experts should be added to each of the five groups that had already been determined. During the formal meeting, each expert will join the group review meeting separately.</p>
<p>The Conference Saves Expenses</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th - The conference funds have not yet been received. In order to save expenses, the reception group will close the reception desk at the Central Hotel starting on the 16th, and experts and members will move into the National Spirit Fellowship Society.</p>
<p>Diligence Bookstore Publishes a Special Issue</p>
<p>The "Physical Education Series" edited and written by the Shanghai Diligence Bookstore has been popular throughout the country. In order to convene the National Physical Education Conference by the Ministry of Education, a special issue of the National Physical Education Conference has been compiled and distributed to all members. The publication has an inscription by Chu Minyi and articles and famous sports quotes by Hao Gengsheng and Jin Zhaojun, members of the conference.

<p>Opinions of Graduates of the Physical Education Department of National Southeast University</p>
<p>The alumni association of the Physical Education Department of National Southeast University, National Higher Normal School, and National Central University congratulates this National Physical Education Conference and offers three points of advice: (1) Summarize proposals, simplify complexity, and integrate parts into a systemic whole in administrative terms to create an overall plan. (2) Have high aspirations but start with small steps. Eliminate sectarian bias and gather collective wisdom to find the root cause and solve the current situation based on national conditions and popular sentiments. (3) Ensure that resolutions can be implemented and realized after the conference.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Closing of the 10th World Games <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>(Elect Telegraph 14th, Los Angeles) The 10th World Olympic Games, which began on July 30th, concluded here this afternoon at 2:00 PM with the equestrian jumping event as the final act. The awards ceremony and closing ceremony were held one after another. Spectators from various countries vied to witness this grand ceremony, scrambling to enter the venue early in the morning. The grandstands around the perimeter were full, leaving no room to stand, with a crowd of approximately 120,000 people. At 1:30 PM, the obstacles for the equestrian competition were neatly arranged, with red and white flags marking the positions of the obstacles. At 2:00 PM, a platform was set up in front of the main grandstand for the winners, with officials from various countries lined up in front. At 2:10 PM, the awards ceremony began. The winner of the boxing event was invited to the platform. Amidst applause and cheers from the crowd, the national flag of the winning country was hoisted high, and the national anthem of the winning country was sung.</p>
<p>The awards ceremony was temporarily suspended, and the final equestrian jumping competition was held. Athletes from various countries, led by France, marched in formation. Then, the French athlete, the winner, demonstrated equestrian skills, galloping east and west. At times, the rider seemed detached from the saddle, and at other times, the horse seemed separated from its rider, a spectacle of wondrous skill. The audience marveled and sighed. Next, the jumping competition was held. Japanese Major Imamura fell from his horse at the fifth obstacle after jumping over the fourth. When he remounted and jumped at the eighth obstacle, the horse disobeyed three times and he was eliminated. Athlete Yoshida withdrew due to injury. Athlete Xi won first place.</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, the awards ceremony resumed. Awards were presented for all track and field events, including the triple jump, pole vault, long jump, and high jump, as well as all water sports. The Olympic medals were also awarded to winners from various countries in succession. At 5:00 PM (9:00 AM on the 15th, Shanghai time), the awards ceremony was completely finished, and the closing ceremony immediately followed. After the music played, Count Henri de Baillet-Latour, the president of the International Olympic Committee, stood on the podium and delivered the closing speech, which generally stated that the 10th Olympic Games had been completed in an orderly and satisfactory manner, and that he expressed his deep gratitude to the Mayor and citizens of Los Angeles and the representatives of various countries. After the speech, five ceremonial cannons were fired, and the resounding military music played. The Olympic flag was taken down and handed by President Baillet-Latour to Los Angeles Mayor Bowron, asking him to keep it until the 11th Games in 1936. The Olympic flame, which had been burning above the main gate of the Games since July 30th, was then extinguished. More than 2,000 athletes from all over the world marched out of the venue in formation. The Games were completely concluded. The National News Agency in Los Angeles reported on the 14th that the 10th World Games, which shook the world, concluded with the awards ceremony today. The number of spectators exceeded that of previous sessions. Newspaper commentaries praised the results as being exceptionally excellent, with many new world and Olympic records created.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Wang Jingwei Will Go to Beijing Soon <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Expressing Agreement with Chiang Kai-shek's Three Points</p>
<p>After President Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan resigned, he was repeatedly and earnestly retained by various Central Committee members. Although he did not agree to withdraw his resignation, he indicated that he would return to Beijing soon. The information obtained by the Central News Agency reporter yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei's Whereabouts: Wang Jingwei returned to his private residence on Xipushi Road at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning. At around 7:00 AM, Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, visited him and talked for a long time. At around 10:00 AM, Wang Jingwei secretly went out alone again and returned home in about 20 minutes. At around 11:00 AM, Tang Youren met with journalists at Wang's residence, and Wang Jingwei left the residence through the side door on the east side at this time. He did not return home until around 1:00 PM. At around 2:00 PM, he met with Zhang Dingfan, former Mayor of Shanghai, and at 5:00 PM, he met with Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry.</p>
<p>Tang Youren's Remarks: At 11:00 AM yesterday morning, Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, hosted reporters at Wang's residence. According to him, he received a telegram from Chairman Chiang on the evening of the 9th and flew to Wuhan to see Chiang on the morning of the 10th. Chiang Kai-shek was quite concerned about Wang Jingwei's sudden resignation and inquired in detail about the reasons for Wang's resignation. After Tang Youren informed him of the facts, Chiang Kai-shek immediately expressed the following three points: (1) He agreed to approve Director Zhang Xueliang's resignation from Beiping; (2) He firmly retained President Wang from resigning; (3) He hoped that President Wang would go to Lushan to discuss everything. After Tang Youren returned to Shanghai on the 11th, he reported the visit to Wuhan and Chiang Kai-shek's three points in detail to President Wang. However, President Wang's intention to resign remained firm. Tang Youren then telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, detailing Wang's continued insistence on resigning. Chiang Kai-shek believed that in this time of national crisis, the central government should not be without a person in charge for a day. Wu Zhihui, a Central Committee member, happened to be going to Wuhan, so he entrusted Wu to carry a personal letter from Chiang to Wang to Shanghai. Wu arrived in Shanghai yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday) afternoon. After Wu arrived in Shanghai, he and Finance Minister Song Ziwen, Army Commander He Yingqin, Education Minister Zhu Jiahua, and Director Zhu Peide visited Wang at Xipushi Road at 5:00 PM yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday). Wu presented Chiang's personal letter to President Wang. The letter was very long and its main points were: (1) Zhang Xueliang's resignation is not a problem, but the military affairs in North China are heavy, and there should be considerable preparation before Zhang's resignation; (2) The resignation of the President of the Executive Yuan is of great importance and cannot be resolved by a few Central Committee members in Shanghai discussing it or exchanging telegrams. Therefore, please go to Lushan to meet with Chairman Lin Sen in order to discuss everything with him. Chairman Lin also intends to invite Wang to Lushan for consultations. Chiang Kai-shek also sent a separate telegram to Wang, inviting him to Lushan, and telegraphed each Minister, including He, Zhu, and Song, asking them to make earnest persuasions when meeting with President Wang. Wang Jingwei expressed agreement with the points in Chiang Kai-shek's letter and indicated that he would go to Beijing after the issue of Director Zhang's resignation was resolved. Tang Youren also told reporters on the phone last night that the date of Wang's visit to Beijing has not been determined. It is still unknown whether it will happen the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo's Remarks: Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo came to Shanghai the night before last and had contact with President Wang. Chen visited Wang yesterday morning, and Wang invited Chen to lunch at a garden in western Shanghai at noon. After two talks, the results were very satisfactory. At around 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Chen left Wang's residence and told reporters from the Central News Agency that the Standing Committee of the Central Committee had approved the resignation of Zhang Xueliang, Pacification Commissioner of Beiping, and that President Wang would go to Beijing in a day or two. Chen himself returned to Beijing by overnight train last night.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Ma Zhanshan's Representative Talks About Ma's Determination to Resist Long-Term <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Unless the Japanese Invaders are Driven Out of Our Territory</p>
<p>I Will Never Return Alive to See My Countrymen</p>
<p>Tian Xiuqiao, the representative of General Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, departed from Dongxingzhen, Bayan County, Heilongjiang Province on July 29th, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, reported the situation of the Anti-Japanese War of the Heilongjiang Army to all circles, and scheduled to go to Beijing soon to request the central government to send troops to recover the lost territory as soon as possible. Representative Tian is a graduate of the Japanese Army Non-commissioned Officer School and is currently the commander of the Fifth Regiment of the Second Cavalry Brigade of Heilongjiang, a brave soldier in the Anti-Japanese War in Northeast China. When reporters met with Representative Tian at the hotel yesterday, they inquired about the latest situation of the Anti-Japanese War in Northeast China. Mr. Wu Huanzhang, Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Affairs Guidance Committee, was also present and informed reporters in detail about the current situation of the Party, government, and army in Heilongjiang Province. The conversation between the two is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Tian Xiuqiao's Talk <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>For several weeks, news of the Black Army has been scarce, mainly because of malfunctions in the military shortwave radio. The Japanese side has seized the opportunity to spread rumors, disrupting information. They claim that Chairman Ma has been killed in battle or that the Black Army has suffered various defeats. These are the usual tricks of clowns and not worth a laugh. However, this also reveals the general "admiration, envy, and fear" that the Japanese hold for our Chairman Ma, who is sincerely patriotic and determined to resist Japan. Since our army began resisting Japan, it has received much praise and assistance from the people, especially from various circles in Shanghai and overseas Chinese. Chairman Ma, fearing that the people might be worried, specially sent his brother south to report on the Black Army's resistance against Japan and to urge the central government to send troops as soon as possible to annihilate the Japanese invaders, recover lost territory, and rescue the 30 million people of Northeast China from their dire situation, thus relieving their suffering.</p>
<p>For months, Japanese aircraft have been showing off their might. Not a day goes by without the Black Army fighting the Japanese. Here is a brief overview to inform the people: The Black Army fought the Japanese south of Hulan for more than 20 days. The soldiers fought bravely, each fighting for himself. With a single cry, each man was ready to take on a hundred. Therefore, they repeatedly defeated the enemy, who fled in panic, building strong fortifications and not daring to cross the line. Our side was planning to take advantage of the situation and annihilate them, but the enemy changed its strategy, repeatedly using more than 20 heavy bombers to bomb Hailun, Suihua, Hulan, and other prosperous counties in our Black province. The people suffered countless deaths and injuries, and countless houses collapsed in a truly unbearable scene. Our army suffered losses due to the lack of anti-aircraft weapons. To protect our compatriots and preserve our strength, we had to voluntarily abandon the cities and move to the countryside to continue fighting the Japanese. The Japanese, fearing our encirclement, did not dare to enter the cities to burn, kill, and loot. This was a win-win strategy.</p>
<p>Chairman Ma intended to contact Commander Ding and Commander Li on June 20, seeking a large-scale offensive, and moved towards Shangji Chang, Qingcheng, Bayan, and other places, defeating the Japanese troops there. Our army then occupied the Daqingshan area as a base for long-term resistance. Daqingshan is a natural fortress, where "one man can hold the pass against ten thousand." Our army can also hide in forests that have not been harvested for thousands of years, hearing voices but not seeing people, able to attack and defend. The Japanese army is currently at a loss. Although they have recently used aircraft to reconnoiter and drop bombs, it has been ineffective. Now, the Japanese artillery fire cannot reach, the bombs cannot be used, and their plans have been exhausted. The troops led by our Chairman Ma are all exceptionally brave and skilled. They include the First Brigade under Wu Songlin, the Second Brigade under Liang Zhenduo, the Third Brigade under Bu Fuchen, the Fourth Brigade under Deng Wen, and the Seventh Brigade under Cai Hongyou, totaling more than 40,000 men. Brigade Commander Liang of the Second Brigade also serves as the commander-in-chief of the militia, commanding more than 30,000 men, all of whom are well-equipped with firearms and are Northeast warriors who have sworn to defend their country and fight the enemy to the death. Only the lack of ammunition is a regrettable issue.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese army fears our Chairman Ma like a deity and hates him to the bone, their ambition has not died. Therefore, on July 14, the Japanese 14th Division and part of the 8th Division used field artillery and aircraft to cover infantry and cavalry, launching a fierce general attack on our Chen garrison in four bloody battles lasting six days and nights. Our army, facing a matter of life and death, firmly defended the Chen garrison and fought desperately. The arrogant Japanese army was finally defeated. The intensity of the battle surpassed even the Jiangqiao battle last year. In this battle, the Japanese suffered about 1,000 casualties, with corpses strewn across the fields. Those not burned by themselves rotted and smelled terrible. Chairman Ma, to uphold humanity, ordered that they all be buried at the foot of the mountain. Our army also suffered heavy casualties. After suffering this setback, the Japanese army dared not act rashly and changed its strategy, adopting a policy of encirclement and blockade. Our army had long anticipated the enemy's plan and hid in the forests or lurked in the green crops. At night, they launched surprise attacks on the enemy's encampments and used small units to attack and harass the enemy's large units, avoiding direct conflict. When they attacked, we retreated; when they retreated, we attacked. The Japanese army struggled to cope and was exhausted. With the rise of the green crops, the overflowing rivers, and the blocked transportation in the mountain area, and with mosquitoes eating people, the Japanese army suffered even more. Around July 25, they withdrew completely to the Hu-Hai line, their intentions unclear.</p>
<p>Chairman Ma is determined. Chairman Ma travels day and night, supervising his subordinates without the slightest懈怠, and is more energetic than before. He often says to those around him, "I (Ma referring to himself) live in prosperous cities, enjoying ease and leisure, but I feel depressed and sluggish. Every time I eat and sleep in the open, riding a horse and galloping amidst the sounds of battle, I feel refreshed and invigorated. Now, fighting the Japanese bandits in the mountain area, I am fighting for the dignity of my 400 million compatriots and for the glory of the Republic of China. I have long disregarded life and death and do not feel that my situation is difficult. There is nothing difficult in the world; it all depends on the firmness of one's determination." Chairman Ma also often goes to various units to instruct and encourage his subordinates to vow to defend the country and to fulfill their duties as soldiers, even if they fight to their last bullet and last soldier, and to not return to see their countrymen until they drive the Japanese bandits out of the country. His subordinate officers and soldiers, mindful of the country's dire situation, all voluntarily forgo their salaries and save them to purchase ammunition. Although they are now in the countryside, their morale is as high as ever, and they have pledged to fight the enemy to the death to save the country and to deal with the Japanese bandits to the end.</p>
<p>I earnestly hope for reinforcements. At the moment, although our army lacks ammunition, this is not yet a major concern. What we fear is that the enemy's reinforcements are constantly arriving and increasing daily, while we have no assistance of a single soldier, a single arrow, or a single bullet. If this continues for a long time, and the enemy's foundation becomes solid, then our 30 million people in Northeast China will die without a place to be buried, and their property will be beyond saving. Let us not dwell on past faults. Now, Director Zhang is emulating the lofty style of the ancients and has resolutely retired. We hope that the central government will quickly select and appoint wise and capable individuals to lead the brave soldiers of the Northeast, taking advantage of the fact that the green crops have not yet fallen and the volunteers are victorious, to break through the pass, recover lost territory, restore our homeland, and rescue our Northeast compatriots from their dire situation. Every person in Northeast China is willing to be a vanguard, devoting their lives to the battlefield. The recent actions of the volunteer army demonstrate the general mentality of our Northeast people.</p>
<p>Waiting for a general offensive. Commander Ding and Commander Li are currently in the Lingyuan and Jinkou areas, with more than 30,000 troops under their command. Commander Wang Delin is in Hengdaohezi, with more than 10,000 troops. Commander Feng Zhanhai is in Wuchang, with 7,000 troops. They have all joined forces and are waiting for a general offensive to annihilate the enemy in one fell swoop. They deeply hope that the people will provide rear support.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Wu Huanzhang's Talk <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Wu Huanzhang, the guiding committee member of the Heilongjiang Province Party Affairs, previously went south for negotiations. Now that his mission is complete, he left Shanghai on the 5th of last month, heading to Heilongjiang via Vladivostok. However, upon arriving in that city, he was immediately detained by the Soviet Russian authorities and repeatedly interrogated. He was finally released on the 7th of this month and sent aboard the original ship to Shanghai. He arrived in port the day before yesterday. According to Wu, the Party, government, and military circles in Heilongjiang Province have united as one. The Party headquarters has formed a political department of the army, deeply involved in guiding the anti-Japanese movement among the people. The people of Heilongjiang Province are already armed and only need a little training to become a strong anti-Japanese force. He will head north within days to engage in this work.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Yun Huifang Released Amid Thunderous Applause <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Judge Feng ruled to allow Yun's bail.</p>
<p>The police lawyer still insisted it was not possible.</p>
<p>The crowd cheered loudly when leaving the court.</p>
<p>Humanity is not dead; the treacherous merchants should be ashamed.</p>
<p>Yun Huifang, a patriotic youth, was arrested for warning treacherous merchants who were privately selling Japanese goods. The Second Special District Local Court sentenced her to two months imprisonment with a two-year reprieve. Subsequently, the Public Concession Police, citing the bombing of the Yongchang Coal Company on Xinzha Road by the Blood Soul Assassination Group, which injured Yu Ruiliang, and the bomb threat letters received by the Cotton Cloth Guild on Shanxi Road, also alleged to be committed by Yun Huifang and Cai Yaozu, requested the First Special District Local Court to prepare a document. On Thursday of the previous week, they went to the Second Special Court and brought Yun to the police station. They also searched Yun and Cai's residence at 207 Park Road, discovering a hand grenade. The next day, they were sent to the First Special Court, where police lawyer Ru Baoyi charged Yun under Articles 282 and 318 of the Criminal Law. After interrogation by Judge Feng Shide, the case was adjourned to a later date because the victim, Yu Ruiliang, did not appear. Yun Huifang's detention has been reported in this newspaper.</p>
<p>A continuous stream of listeners. Yesterday morning was the date for the continuation of the trial. The Chinese and foreign detectives in charge of the case escorted Yun to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court at 8:30 AM. Both lawyers also appeared in court one after another. However, the Public Works Department, which filed the lawsuit, also sent the department's acting chief lawyer, Gan Jingxian, to participate. People from all walks of life came to court to listen, in an endless stream. After 9:00 AM, the court was already overcrowded, and the area outside the court was still extremely crowded, estimated to be around five or six hundred people.</p>
<p>Yu Ruiliang did not appear in court. At 9:30 AM, Judge Feng, Chief Prosecutor Wang, and the clerk took their seats. They ordered the bailiffs to bring the defendant to the defendant's box. First, lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that Yu Ruiliang had been summoned and had personally signed the summons, but he had not yet appeared. He did not know why. Then, Chinese detective No. 129 reported on the situation of summoning Yu at the Yongcheng Coal Company.</p>
<p>The Second Special Court did not appeal. Judge Feng then asked Yun Huifang, "How did the Second Special District Court rule on your case? What crime were you convicted of?" Yun replied, "They sentenced me to two months' imprisonment with a two-year reprieve." Lawyer Zhao Chen added, "The court made its judgment based on Article 319 of the Criminal Law." The judge continued to ask, "Did you or the plaintiff declare an appeal in that case?" Yun shook her head repeatedly. Lawyer Zhao replied that the police lawyer was very satisfied with the judgment at the time and did not advocate for an appeal.</p>
<p>Throwing the bomb was an entire plan. The judge asked, "What kind of actions did you take in that case?" Yun replied, "I also used a bomb to warn the treacherous merchant Maochang Foreign Cloth Company." The judge asked, "Was this action intended to warn all treacherous merchants with bombs, and was it part of an entire plan?" Yun immediately said, "Yes." Judge Feng then declared that the case had a continuing relationship with the case in the French Concession, so the court considered it necessary to review the case files. Because of this legal issue, the trial could not proceed today and would have to be postponed.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Photo of Yun Huifang (center) being released on bail from the courthouse (Photo by Li Zunyong) <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yun Huifang was granted bail by shop guarantee. Lawyer Li Zuyu immediately stood up and requested that the defendant be allowed to post bail. The judge nodded. At this time, police lawyer Gan Jingxian objected, saying that the case concerned local security, and the Public Works Department opposed bail. Lawyer Zhao Chen retorted that there was no need to object to this point. At this time, Judge Feng had already announced the ruling: the case was postponed for one week, pending the review of Yun Huifang's case files from the Second Special District Local Court. Yun Huifang was to be released on a substantial shop guarantee.</p>
<p>The police lawyer's appeal. Hearing this ruling, lawyer Gan continued to state that, according to Article 414 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, an appeal should be filed. Before this appeal was ruled on, he demanded that the execution of the bail ruling be suspended. Judge Feng immediately informed him that bail could not be appealed, while lawyer Li Zuyu stated that, according to Article 415 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, an appeal was not permitted. Lawyer Gan further stated that Article 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure stipulated that the court could suspend execution before the appeal was ruled on. Lawyer Zhao Chen then rebutted, saying that the provision stated that it "may rule to suspend execution." Since the word "may" was used, it was clear that suspension was not mandatory. If the plaintiff was indeed dissatisfied, he could submit a written statement of opinion within three days according to Article 419.</p>
<p>The judge ordered the debate to end. Lawyer Gan continued, saying that the reason the police opposed bail was that the defendant was a member of the Blood Soul Group, and some accomplices had not yet been apprehended. If she were released on bail, there would be no hope of arresting the escaped accomplices, and there would still be a danger to security. Therefore, he had to oppose it. Lawyer Li Zuyu explained the purpose of detention in detail, saying that detention was intended to prevent escape and to facilitate the apprehension of accomplices. There was no need for detention beyond this. The defendant had been released on bail before and had not escaped. As for Cai, if he wanted to escape, he would not have to wait until the defendant was released on bail to escape. Therefore, the police's opposition to bail was an overreaction. At this point in the debate, the judge ruled that the case had been decided and ordered all parties to end the debate. He also ordered the police to take Yun to the bail office and allow her to be released on bail after the guarantee procedures were completed.</p>
<p>Two shops provided the guarantee. After the court granted bail, the listeners were overjoyed. The bailiff took her to the bail room to wait for bail. At that time, there were more than two hundred shops willing to provide a guarantee. Since the court only required a substantial shop guarantee, Baohe Tang on Sichuan Road and Xiangtai Silver Shop on Rue Robert were asked by Lawyer Zhao Chen to fill out the guarantee forms. Li Qianheng and Chen Shusheng from the two shops took out the seals they had prepared and stamped them, and signed their names to take responsibility. According to court practice, after filling out the guarantee form, it must be verified at the shop once. After going back and forth, the procedures were completed at half past twelve. Yun Huifang, amidst thunderous applause, followed Wang Jian'e and other representatives from the Changzhou Association in Shanghai, boarding car number 12032 and driving straight out of the courthouse door.</p>
<p>Yun Huifang's family history. According to Yun, her family has lived in Changzhou for generations. Her parents are both alive and well, but she has no brothers or sisters. Yun is the only one in the Yun lineage. She came to Shanghai to do business two years ago, initially working at the Minhua Printing House and recently joining the Lianhua Printing House on Shanhai Pass Road. Since this incident occurred, Lianhua has made no statement. She was treated very well in the police station and did not suffer any hardship, only asked to give a statement.</p>
<p>Matters of legal consideration will be discussed later.</p>
<p>While waiting for bail, the representatives of various groups who came to the court to listen planned to ask Yun to report on the situation at the police station to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce after she was released on bail. However, this proposal was dropped to avoid causing trouble. Before the case was opened, it was rumored that the court had held a meeting to discuss how to judge Yun's case. However, the reporter personally visited Judge Feng Shide, who replied that there was no such thing. However, before the trial, Judge Feng had discussed with police lawyer Ru Baoyi whether the offenses were legally connected. As a result, it was decided that the case files from the Second Special District Court would need to be retrieved for reference.</p>
<p>Yun will return to Changzhou for a short rest. As for Yun's whereabouts after leaving the court, it was kept secret to avoid patriotic comrades crowding to comfort her and to prevent opponents from harming her. It is said that she plans to return to her hometown of Changzhou to rest and await the court's trial.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department is on high alert. For the sake of protecting the peace of the court and maintaining order, the Public Works Department's police department specially dispatched a large team of armed detectives, thirty or forty men, driving a large red police car with a machine gun inside, to the front of the court, parked on the east side of North Zhejiang Road at Qipu Road. Some of the detectives in the car were deployed around the corridors inside the court gate to assist the existing bailiffs in maintaining security. All positions in the court were changed to double posts. The atmosphere at the time was quite tense, causing passersby who did not know the reason to stop and watch, but they all knew to maintain order, and there was no disorder throughout.</p>
<p>Leaving the court amidst cheers. Yun was in the judicial police office from 10:30 AM until 12:00 PM. The guarantee from the guarantor shop was submitted by the lawyer to Judge Feng for approval before she was allowed to regain her freedom. As soon as she left the threshold of the room, those who wanted to see the demeanor of the patriot, whether they knew her or not, rushed forward to express their condolences. Unexpectedly, Yun was surrounded. At that time, applause and cheers were heard in the distance. Several photographers also carried fast lenses and asked Yun to take a photo before representatives from various groups accompanied her to board the car, which drove away in cheers.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Large Numbers of Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Japan had successively returned to their home countries at the beginning of the war. Those who had not been able to return were generally people with economic difficulties and no work. The government had already transported three batches of them to Shanghai. Recently, there were still people stranded in Japan, with no means of livelihood, who were being pushed to Shanghai by the Japanese police. Yesterday, when the Kasado Maru ship arrived in Shanghai, another large group of Chinese were expelled. Here is a record of the situation:</p>
<p>Not allowed to stay in Japan. There was a group of Chinese workers in Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture, Japan. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, they had been dismissed by Japanese factories. However, due to economic difficulties, they had not yet returned to their home countries. Now, the Japanese authorities, on the grounds that these Chinese workers did not have a certificate allowing them to stay in Japan and that they were subject to the ban on entry, should be expelled. The Nagoya Maritime Police Station took this large group of Chinese workers to the police station and detained them. On the 10th of this month, they were forced to board the Kasado Maru ship to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Number of people expelled. Those who were expelled by the Japanese maritime police and escorted to Shanghai included Zhu Jin Yan, Liu Chengfu, Zhuo Xishi, Xia Renxing, Ye Benfa, Ye Yansheng, Xu Xiangyan, Ding Yuanxiang, Ye Jinxiang, Zhou Zhongmei, Xu Zhengyuan, Xu Xiji, Mao Rongbiao, Chen Yuanfa, Liu Tuoyan, He Ruxing, Chen Nanxing, Wang Zuoxuan, Ye Zaolai, Wu Yueshu, Dong Yaoshu, Lin Keyuan, and Zhu Songbo, Zhang Lun, Chen Yihuo, and others, totaling thirty-four people.</p>
<p>Returning home in a state of distress. When those who were expelled arrived in Shanghai, they all landed at the Huishan Wharf. Each person's travel expenses had to be paid. If they did not have cash, they had to hand over their luggage to the ship to be kept by the Shanghai Japan Shipping Company. After they had collected the money, they could redeem it. Each person landed in Shanghai in a very distressed state. They have now all returned to their original homes in Wenzhou and Qingtian, Zhejiang.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Baihe River is Blocked Again <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Xinming ran aground and was rescued.</p>
<p>After the Baihe River in Tianjin was blocked by silt, it was dredged by the Tianjin Customs this year, and Shanghai's Beiyang ships were able to pass through to Zizhulin. However, not long after the route reopened, on the 12th of this month, it was blocked again due to heavy upstream flooding. Ships with a draft of ten feet could not travel. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinming ship, which had come to Shanghai from Tianjin, ran aground at the corner of the Baihe River Railway Pier on the 13th. The ship was trapped in the silt for two days and nights. Yesterday, a telegram was received stating that the Tianjin branch had sent a ship to tow it out. Whether the bottom of the ship was damaged or not needs to be inspected after arriving in Shanghai. From yesterday onwards, Chinese and foreign shipping companies in this port have again changed their Beiyang routes to end at Tanggu and will not go to Baihe Zizhulin. Passengers and cargo bound for Tianjin are all transferring ships in Tanggu.</p>
<h3 id="e122">The British-owned Public Bus Strike is Getting Worse <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Armed escorts protect the reluctant operation of buses.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the No. 9 bus line was disrupted, affecting passengers.</p>
<p>The workers petitioned the Party and government agencies yesterday.</p>
<p>After the workers of the British-owned public bus company in the Public Concession went on strike, the striking workers adopted direct action, and unfortunate incidents occurred, and the situation deteriorated. The company announced the recruitment of new workers, and the provisional strike committee petitioned the Party and government agencies yesterday, requesting mediation. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Armed buses. After the company refused to negotiate, the workers adopted direct action, resulting in the beating of a White Russian, the blocking of buses, and the involvement of passengers the day before yesterday. The factory manager and superintendent of the company, specially for maintaining traffic, still dispatched fourteen buses on Route 1, seven buses on Route 2, seven buses on Route 5, six buses on Route 6, twenty-four buses on Route 9, and special express buses yesterday. Plainclothes Chinese police officers dispatched by the police station armed escorts to travel with the buses. At the same time, the police station notified all Chinese and foreign detectives to pay special attention and provide protection along the way to prevent incidents.</p>
<p>Passengers insulted. Although each bus route was protected by detectives yesterday, the striking workers still tried to block them. At 1:25 PM, No. 114 of Route 9, bus No. 97, sold No. 31, and Chinese police officer No. 4465, driving to the west of the Dongxin Bridge on Avenue Edward VII, were hit by striking workers throwing hollowed-out watermelons filled with manure from behind the bus. Eight Chinese passengers and two Western passengers were affected. The order was disrupted at once. The patrol officers used water to clean them. The British Chinese Public Bus Company agreed to be responsible for compensating for the damage to the passengers' clothing caused by the manure, and the matter was settled.</p>
<p>Recruiting new workers. The company is eager to find ways to restore the operation of public buses. Therefore, factory manager Xiao Date directly entrusted the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center to recruit new workers. Later, because the guidance center received a warning from the strike committee, it only recruited twenty-five people, who have already begun training. Yesterday, the company announced the qualifications for recruiting new workers: (1) able to read and speak English, (2) a suitable shop guarantee, (3) two two-inch photos (4) no addictions. Many people applied. The company's entrance on Connaught Road was overcrowded. These people knew that the strike committee would definitely try to make things difficult for them, but forced by livelihood, they disregarded everything and risked seeking employment. It can be seen that the panic of unemployment after the war is getting more and more serious, which is chilling.</p>
<p>Workers' congress. Public bus striking workers held a general assembly at the Renhe Teahouse on Wuding Road at 1:00 PM yesterday. The chairman first reported on the strike process and the company's refusal to negotiate. It was decided on the spot: (1) The six worker representatives designated by the company will have their status as strike committee members revoked. (2) Six people will be elected to supplement the strike committee. (3) A declaration will be issued with textual revisions. In a temporary motion, most workers advocated free action. After the strike committee explained everything and advised the crowd.</p>
<p>Strike committee statement. The strike committee said to the reporter of the New Voice Society yesterday that after the company refused the conditions, all the workers were extremely angry and advocated using force to deal with the company and destroying the vehicles. Because the workers came from the military and police, they were very confident. The strike committee repeatedly advised that the workers' strike was for their own lives and conditions. Absolutely do not take violent actions that affect passengers unless absolutely necessary. Only by consolidating unity, earnestly uniting the drivers, coppersmiths, sweepers, and Chinese staff, and fighting together can the four minimum requirements be resolved satisfactorily. There are absolutely no other excessive demands and actions. Moreover, this disturbance was not a strike committee order or resolution. It was caused by the company's oppression and should be the full responsibility of the company. The strike committee expressed its deep sympathy and regret for the passengers who were mistakenly affected.</p>
<p>Workers' petition. The provisional strike committee of the British-owned public bus company dispatched four representatives at 11:00 AM yesterday to petition the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the company had appointed ticket sellers Nos. 23, 133, 150, 208, 26, 3, 6, etc. on July 25 as worker representatives to negotiate wage increase plans in exchange for workers not taking bribes. However, the company did not fulfill its promise, suppressed the workers, and caused a strike. It was overthrown by force and dismissed. The third section mediator will receive them and promise to report to the director for handling. Later, he went to the Municipal Party Department to petition, where the director of the people's training section received him. He fully accepted the workers' request.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Petition to the Municipal Government by the Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Advancement Association Regarding Compensation <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>During the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong and other areas bore the brunt. Relying on their aircraft and artillery, the Japanese army wantonly bombed and burned our prosperous areas. Therefore, the losses of our people's houses and properties were enormous. After the armistice agreement was signed, the Japanese army gradually withdrew according to the procedures stipulated in the agreement. The disaster-avoiding people returned one after another, but their residences were burned and their property was robbed. The hardship of their situation could not be imagined by those who lived in the concessions. A portion of the residents, because they had fire insurance, negotiated with the companies, requesting compensation. However, a few companies believed that losses from military fire were not within the scope of fire insurance and that the company had no obligation to compensate. The policyholders believed that although some of the damage was caused by gunfire, most of it was caused by arson by the Japanese army and traitors. Therefore, it should be considered fire insurance. Because of this, the two sides were deadlocked and could not reach a decision for a long time. Recently, individual negotiations have felt scattered and it is feared that victory will be difficult to achieve. Therefore, more than 5,000 policyholders have organized the Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Advancement Association, elected committee members to negotiate with various companies, and obtained assistance from organizations such as the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the Lawyers Association, and the Accountants Association, to organize research and uphold justice. After several meetings, the opinions of both parties were considered close. Unexpectedly, the insurance industry changed its mind midway, overturned the proposal, attempted to cancel the proposed issuance of public bonds, and refused to attend. The association was unable to proceed, so it sent more than 50 representatives, including Ye Jiaxing and Tang Youwei, to the municipal government yesterday afternoon at about 2:00 PM to petition. Five representatives were selected to enter and request to see Mayor Wu. The mayor was out on official business, so Municipal Government Secretary Wang Shaozhai received them on his behalf and promised to convey what the representatives said, along with the original petition, to the mayor and wait for instructions on how to handle it. The representatives were satisfied and left. Afterwards, according to those in charge of the municipal government, both sides in the Shanghai Incident had not declared war. Whether or not it can be called a war and whether the resulting losses are within the scope of fire insurance should be carefully studied. Moreover, this kind of dispute must be resolved through legal procedures and cannot be resolved by administrative action. However, what kind of reply and solution will be given must await the mayor's approval. After the representatives withdrew, they went to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition. The association's document to the municipal government is recorded below: The document is presented to expose the insurance industry's pursuit of profit and disregard for the suffering of the disaster victims, and to present the whole story in detail, hoping that it will be reviewed and quickly given relief. Since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong have been the hardest hit, all becoming war zones. Lives were lost, and property was burned. The disaster victims fled for their lives with the old and the young. After the overall situation was stabilized, the only thing they could expect for living expenses and reconstruction funds was the compensation for their fire insurance. However, insurance companies made various excuses, and individual negotiations were ineffective. In order to seek collective efforts to deal with the situation, all insurance disaster victims organized the Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Advancement Association, elected committee members, and began negotiations, with the support of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the Lawyers Association, and the Accountants Association, which organized research and did their best to uphold justice. After several days of meetings, the two sides were very close, and concrete measures were about to be produced. Unexpectedly, the insurance industry suddenly changed its attitude midway, overturned repeated proposals, and refused to send anyone to attend, even attempting to cancel the proposal to issue public bonds that it had put forward itself. Such inconsistency shows a complete lack of good faith. Moreover, it has been found that each insurance company takes in insurance premiums of more than 20 million yuan each year, while the disaster victims are suffering so much, yet they are indifferent. The cruelty of their intentions is beyond description. If the insurance industry insists on handling matters according to the regulations, then the regulations printed on the insurance policy are all one-sided and broad, with a scope that includes a hundred ways to avoid compensation. It is clear that the organization is for self-interest and aims to absorb the funds of the people. If strict intervention is not taken, society will suffer endlessly. The representatives were sent by more than 5,000 disaster victims as the backing of the Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Advancement Association and vowed to fight to the death at any cost. Only because this matter is closely related to the well-being of society, we cannot but submit this petition. We respectfully request that you take measures to provide relief so that the purpose of compensation can be achieved. Therefore, we present the following facts and request that you promptly instruct the insurance industry association and convene a meeting of important social organizations to decide on appropriate solutions to save the disaster victims. This would be a great act of kindness. Respectfully submitted, more than 5,000 representatives Chen Zufar, Zhang Shusheng, Yao Gensheng, and 50 others.</p>

<p>All Sixteen Yuan Earned Over the Years</p>
<p>All Donated to the Northeast Volunteer Army</p>
<p>A reporter from Dagong News Agency passed by Xiaofanen Wang Furen in Haining yesterday. The hawker had donated the 16 yuan earned over the years to the Volunteer Army. The reporter expressed his respect to him and chatted casually. The hawker sighed and said, "The national crisis is so severe that we hate not being able to kill the enemy on the battlefield. I occasionally read in the newspaper that our Volunteer Army is extremely brave in killing the enemy, which makes people feel a little comforted. I also saw an advertisement in the newspaper saying that donating 16 yuan can help the Volunteer Army to get 200 bullets. I was overjoyed and resolutely donated all 16 yuan earned over the years. Although the amount is very small, it is all I have. From now on, I will live frugally, and I will continue to donate what I earn." The reporter was deeply impressed and expressed it to encourage our compatriots.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Declaration of the National Self-Salvation Association <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Peaceful Boycott Method</p>
<p>The National Self-Salvation Association declared, "The original economic and social organization of our country has been shaken since it was subjected to economic aggression by Japanese imperialism. On September 18th last year, the Japanese again used force to occupy the three northeastern provinces, the lifeline of our country's economy. On January 28th this year, they again used aircraft and bombs to destroy Songhu, the most prosperous market in our country. As a result, the economic organization of the entire society is clearly in a state of total collapse. Farmers may have land to cultivate, but they have no capital to cultivate it. Factories may have workers to work, but they have no capital to maintain them. Merchants who rely on agriculture and industry for a living naturally have no business to operate and are waiting for death. Bankruptcies are heard of every day. Recently, a large number of Japanese goods have been imported and sold at low prices. The price of yarn has fallen by 20-30%, and the price of coal is only half that of domestic products. Raw silk is our country's main product. It is not enough to seize our European and American markets, and they are also dumping it in our country in an attempt to disrupt it. The Japanese municipal government's newly published monthly magazine 'East Asian Trade Research' advocates that in the future, to establish new enterprises in China, it is necessary to have considerable capital. Their intention is to sweep away all Chinese industries to satisfy their great desire. The Japanese are planning against us so far-sightedly and urgently. At this critical moment of life and death, shall we be helpless and allow ourselves to be oppressed and extinguished, or shall we rise up and resist them to seek self-salvation? We all know that in the 20th century, in addition to weapons and guns, there are also commodities. Killing people with guns is only effective for millions of people, but killing people with commodities is effective enough to exterminate a race. The Japanese are using both methods against us, guns and commodities at the same time. We can only unite and defend ourselves to save the country and seek self-sufficiency to save ourselves. What is the way to self-sufficiency? The positive way is to promote domestic goods, and the negative way is to boycott enemy goods. We all hold these two meanings and specially gather comrades to establish the National Self-Salvation Association. On the one hand, we boycott enemy goods to make them disappear from the Chinese market, thereby compensating for the economic losses of the country. On the other hand, we engage in the domestic goods movement, striving to increase and develop production to meet the needs of people's livelihood, so that China, which is in a state of total economic collapse, can turn danger into safety and become a self-sufficient country. This is the ambition we hold, and it is also the task of this association. Furthermore, things must rot themselves before worms grow. A country must attack itself before others insult it. If our country did not have treacherous merchants to promote Japanese goods, even if they came from the whole country, how could they force people to buy them? Therefore, to boycott them, we must first eliminate internal traitors. This association adopts peaceful means to deal with treacherous merchants, first persuading them with kind words to inspire their conscience and accept the association's regulations. If they do not listen to persuasion, we can only announce the facts in the newspaper so that the people of the country will know their crimes. This is the most peaceful boycott method, which should be sympathized with by all friendly countries. As the saying goes, sincerity can move even metal and stone. A thousand fingers pointing, dying without disease. Do not do nothing because empty words are useless. Gentlemen of our country, why not come and join us?"</p>

The collection period will begin on October 16th and end on November 15th, and the district offices and regiment headquarters will be jointly responsible for handling it. (2) Regarding how to start implementing the inspection of regiment members in various districts, it was resolved that the office would set a date, notify the district regiments, and convene the inspection. (3) Regarding how to pay the salaries of the training officers of the county security regiment appointed by the Civil Affairs Department for June, it was resolved that the county government would temporarily advance the funds and reimburse them from the reserve fund for the 21st year in the future. (4) Regarding how to handle the implementation of the measures for rectifying the original security funds of various counties promulgated by the provincial government, it was resolved: (A) That each district regiment should submit a report on the amount of the original security donations, excluding busy canal land donations, that have been received. (B) That the expenses and handling of the temporary security regiment should be strictly checked at any time, and only reductions are allowed, and no increases are allowed.</p>

<p>The annual salary increase for staff members of radio stations under the Ministry of Communications has always been scheduled to begin in July each year, but due to various reasons, the authorities often postpone it until September or October. The staff members of various stations, due to the lack of a central organization, have been unable to achieve consensus. This year, since the establishment of the National Association of Staff Members of Radio Stations, the work has been intense and no effort has been spared. The matter of salary increase is particularly urgent. Letters have been submitted repeatedly. Yesterday, the standing committee members of the association, Xie Chunpu, Shen Yide, Feng Zhenyi, and others, also went to the International Telecommunications Bureau on Moore Road to visit Zhong E, the director of the Telegraph Administration and the director of the bureau. According to the conversation, due to the uncertain political situation recently, official documents have been slightly delayed. The standing committee members immediately gathered information and presented the details, requesting that it be announced by the end of August at the latest. Zhong E agreed to urge the Ministry of Communications to issue the order, and the result was satisfactory.</p>

<p>Pu Henian, a native of Qingpu who lived in the rear building of Rongji Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Shop at No. 825 Dongxi Huade Road, killed his concubine, Wang Xiuying from Suzhou, at noon on the 9th of this month. Wang found that he was broke. After being concubines and discovering his broke status, Wang was intimate with other people and forced him to write a letter of divorce, which he did not agree to. He was also insulted. Pu and Wang had been living together for only more than four months and had spent hundreds of dollars. Before, she had asked him to divorce his fiancee Shunbao in his hometown, otherwise she would not live with him. He suffered all kinds of harm. In such a sad situation, when she used this as an excuse to break up with him, he could not bear it any longer and killed Wang Xiuying with a kitchen knife. The police station has escorted Pu to the First Special Zone Court, and the details of the interrogations have been published in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over the fourth criminal court and sentenced Pu Henian to life imprisonment for the crime of murder. The murder weapon was confiscated. He also declared to the defendant that the charges brought by the police station should be punishable by death. Considering that Wang Xiuying was also at fault in this case, the sentence was reduced. If you disagree, you can appeal within ten days. Pu said yes.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Letter from the Ruifeng Li Housing Association Requesting Landlords <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Ruifeng Housing Residents Association of Dong Jiaxing Road, Hongkou, recently had the two neighborhoods of Ruiji and Ruiyuan nearby (with the same landlord as Ruifeng Li) request to join. Their request was granted. Regarding the issue of rent, everyone felt it was too high and unbearable. The association specifically sent a letter yesterday to the landlord Yeguang Company of the three neighborhoods, earnestly requesting a temporary reduction to relieve the people's distress. The original letter is excerpted below: (The preceding part is omitted) Previously, this association sent a letter announcing its establishment and inviting your review. Now, many members have come to the association claiming that during the January 28th Incident, the disaster occurred suddenly, and this area was right in the path of the fighting. Fortunately, there were few residents at the time, and caught unprepared, they all fled empty-handed to avoid the battle. When the chaos subsided and they cautiously returned, every house was empty, and all their savings had vanished. What is even more peculiar is that member Jin Zhezhen's residence at numbers 22 and 24 had its doors unopened, and remained sealed as before, but the belongings stored inside had all disappeared, with losses amounting to a huge sum of 320 yuan. The reason is that Mr. Jin's daughter was to be married in early February, and they had moved here from Zhabei for that purpose. The trousseau prepared was also stolen. It is said that he reported the case to the Harbin Police Station around March 5th, and also sent a letter to your esteemed company, but has not received a reply to this day. We presume you have tacitly agreed to compensate. Now, the war has come to an end, and the residents have barely regained their breath. After the war, all industries are in decline, and it is truly difficult to afford such high rents. We ask that you especially consider this and grant a reduction to help the people of this neighborhood, who have survived war and natural disasters, to ease their burden and hopefully maintain their livelihoods. Regarding the start of rent collection, we also ask for a reasonable extension. As mentioned above, this area was designated as a war zone. Residents who have any savings are all hesitant and unwilling to move back, like startled birds fearing a bent bow. Those who are eagerly returning to the neighborhood now are all poor and destitute people, who dare to brave the dangers because there is no other place for them to settle. We believe this is something your esteemed landlord is well aware of. Considering that Nanjing, Anqing, Hangzhou, and other places were only indirectly affected with very little impact, their residents were granted a 50% rent reduction. Compared to those who actually suffered from the war, how can there be such unequal fortune? After suffering so much, the residents are like dried fish in a rut, struggling to make a living, how can you impose the pre-war market rent? A slight reduction in rent is as light as a feather for the landlord, but the gratitude felt by the common people is as heavy as Mount Tai. If the landlord is generous above, the residents can live in peace below. After a few years, things will surely return to normal. At that time, there will be no need for the landlord to increase the rent, and the tenants will be happy to request an increase first, to express their gratitude for the rent reduction at this time. Although the income may be slightly reduced now, it will surely increase in the future. The overall amount will not be harmed, and your esteemed landlord's virtue of cherishing life will be felt by both gods and men. All of us in the association feel the same way. We will lead all members, work hard, burn incense and express our gratitude at your door. Overwhelmed with emotion, we cannot express our request enough. (The following part is omitted)</p>

<h3 id="e154">Financial Gold Market Still Chaotic <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold fluctuated greatly, rising and falling. The market situation was still chaotic. Although the morning market was stable, the afternoon market was very volatile. The daily high and low differed by more than eleven taels. At the end, it rose by more than three taels. Industry sentiment was uneasy, and transactions were complex. Initially, the price rose because the silver market was reported to be falling, reaching over 730 taels. This was because the foreign exchange rate shifted, with the British and American rates being stable, and the exchange rate rising. Later, it fluctuated by one or two taels. The afternoon market initially weakened because the transaction for the September to October forward contract had started one day early. Because the price was lower, there were many sellers, and the market fell into a weak state. It was also heard that the American president planned to raise the price of goods to save the declining financial situation, which caused a drop of ten taels. As for the forward contract, the short side was still offering the premium, initially at six taels, but there were not many transactions. Later, the large account of Yuan Xingyong dropped out more than 2,000 taels, mostly at five and a half taels, and again at five taels. Also, Yifengyong and other parties were willing to drop out, causing the price to fall to within three taels. The short side, Hengxing and others, had transactions, with the smallest being two taels and two or three qian, and then within three taels. The full-day market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>Opening up six taels and four qian Since the September contract opened, it rose by six taels and four qian to 732 taels. The premium on large bars narrowed from eleven-sixteenths to five-eighths. The US silver also decreased by seven-eighths. The forward contract also fell. Private telegraphs were down by seven-sixteenths, resulting in a high opening. Hengchangyong, Hengxing, Yuan Hengxing, Wanxing, Shunli and others sold tirelessly, and the price suddenly fell by more than two taels, but only briefly rebounded by a few qian. The US dollar seemed to be loose and could be settled at 56.25 this month. Later, Run Chang, Yu Fu, Tai Heng, Heng Yu, Heng Xing Yuan and others came in, and banks mutually did the November 875, adding more than two taels, to 32 taels. Hengxing then issued, and Yifengyong and others followed suit, reducing to 30 taels in an instant. When the British gold announcement and the US dollar both dropped by one or two and a half, it was 31 taels and two qian. There was a fluctuation of five or six qian. Later, Heng Yu, Tong Taichang, Yuan Tai, Yifengyong, Hong Kangyong, Hengchangyong, Yu He and others sold very strongly. Zhejiang issued November US dollars at 875, and Zhengjin issued September British gold at 1.91875, so the price plunged by more than two taels, to 29 taels and two qian at 10:00. Then, Yuan Kang, Xiang Yuan, Tai Yuan Heng, Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, Hengxing Yuan and others bought in large quantities. HSBC absorbed September US dollars at 625, and at 10:40 it was 31 taels and six qian. Later, because zero accounts sold out, and October British gold at 25 could be settled, it was 29 taels and eight qian after 11:00, and then fluctuated around 30 taels. Yuan Maoyong, Fu Taiheng, Heng Yu, and scattered short sellers all entered. Also, Huabei and HSBC did August US dollars at half yuan, causing the price to increase by one tael and zero. At noon, it was 31 taels and one qian, and then closed at 30 taels and six qian because commodity hedging came out and continued to drop to within 30 taels.</p>
<p>Resulting in a heavy fall of three taels and four qian The afternoon opening was weak at 26 taels and eight qian. Because the forward contract had opened, and the premium was cheaper, the large army and Heng Yu, Daxingyong and others sold one after another, so it dropped again to 25 taels and eight qian. It fluctuated by about one tael. Soon, Zhaofengchang and Tong Taichang commodities came in. Also, Huabi absorbed November at 31 yuan, and Zhengjin absorbed August at 30 yuan and six qian two five. At 2:30, it was six taels and eight qian. Suddenly, because the sellers were too strong, Heng Yu, Yifengyong, Yuan Xingyong, Hengxingyuan and others all came out. Also, September US dollars at 6875 could be settled. At 3:00, it was 23 taels and eight qian. After a while, it was heard that the bank had opened 210 bars of spot goods, sold by Yingfeng Hengjing, causing the price to rise immediately by one tael and zero, to 24 taels and nine qian. In an instant, a bank telegram reported that President Hoover had said that he would raise commodity prices, and people's hearts were frustrated. To prevent the silver market from rising, and because Qian Changxiang and Fuchang and others bravely sold, and the exchange rate loosened further, the gold price plummeted, falling sharply by more than four taels. At 3:50, it ended at 20 taels and six qian. At this time, Bingxing and Hengxing came in, pulling up two taels, to 22 taels and six or seven qian. At 4:00, the closing price was 22 taels and two qian, a fall of three taels and four qian compared with last Saturday. According to the daily range, the maximum was 32 taels, and the minimum was 20 taels and six qian, a difference of 11 taels and four qian. The red bar was added by eight taels and seven five.</p>
<p>The revealed price was mostly suppressed by seven taels. The revealed price was changed to 793 taels and four. The US dollar was reduced by one two five, estimated to be buttoned 62 taels to 64 taels, and 65 taels to 712 taels in the afternoon, which was buttoned seven taels more than last Saturday. The accounts were registered before and after the market twice (double closing price): 31 taels in the morning, 22 taels in the afternoon, water replenishment of 30 taels, and 21 taels in the afternoon. The ups and downs of each firm were normal. Transactions on the platform were still even. It is estimated that Zhifengyong, Yuanheng, Futaiheng, Yuan Kangxiang, Fuxingyong were short, and Shunli, Yu He, Wanxing, Dadecheng, Hengchangyong, Hengxingyuan, Zhaofengchang, Yifengyong, Hongkangyong were long. Hengxing issued more than 300 taels, with a small number coming in. Heng Yu, Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Tai, Tong Taichang's issues were confusing. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Dadecheng, and Shunli were all long, and Wanxing, Qian Changxiang, Hengxingyuan, Yifengyong, Heng Yu, Daxingyong were all short. Bingxing was initially short and then long. Commodity hedging sometimes had ups and downs. The rest were complex.</p>

<p>Yarn Sales Still Brisk. The offtake of spot yarn is still good. It is estimated that various regional merchants bought a total of 1,200 bales throughout the day. The market is holding steady. The purchase amounts for each region are listed below:</p>
<p>Shantou 205, Inland 500, Luzhou 15, Fellow Traders 115, Guangdong 85, Sichuan 160, Changsha 50, Total 1,200 bales. The cotton market is extremely bullish.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Extremely Bullish</p>
<p>The cotton market is experiencing a sharp rise due to the stable and strong performance of American cotton, with news suggesting further increases. The exchange rate is also not loosening, which is intensifying the eagerness of buyers, leading to stronger upward momentum. Another factor is the limited deliveries for this month, which is exciting bullish traders. Recent rainfall has greatly benefited cotton fields, and some are selling in distant months. The future direction of the market will continue to depend on the performance of American cotton.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Rises Sharply by Eighty-Nine Qian. At the opening of the Zheng Standard trading session, with American cotton up 15 points, buyer demand was especially strong, pushing prices up by five or six qian for each month. In the afternoon, market sentiment remained positive, with prices rising another two qian. The total volume traded for the day was 88,800 dan. Geng Feng sold 5,000 dan, Rong Xing 1,900 dan, Ren Feng 2,700 dan, Yi Chang 2,100 dan, Yu Chang 2,700 dan, Yi Feng 2,100 dan. Rui Yuan bought 4,400 dan, Tai Xing 2,700 dan, Sui Long 2,500 dan, Shen Ji 1,300 dan, and Chang Feng 2,600 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>There is slight demand for raw cotton. Consumption of spot cotton is still flat, and factories are showing limited interest in purchasing.</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Cotton: 34.50, Heng Feng buys 400 pieces, spot goods sent to factory. Shaanxi Cotton: 34.50, Yu Feng buys 700 pieces, also 34.25.</p>
<p>Huoji Cotton: 31.00, Tong Yi buys 200 bales, also.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Statistics on Shashi Cotton Exports for the Past Ten Years <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Shashi is an important port in western Hubei. Cotton production in the western Hubei region (mainly American cotton) is exported through Shashi. Farmers, recognizing the lively market and higher profits compared to other agricultural products, have been gradually expanding cotton cultivation in recent years. Unfortunately, due to disturbances by bandits, the autumn harvest yields are lower than before, and the export volume has also decreased accordingly. Furthermore, farmers' ingrained habit of adulteration and unwillingness to select good seeds are also contributing to the decline. In late 1930, widespread flooding devastated the province, with 69 counties affected and severe damage to cotton production in 45 counties. The following are the export volumes of cotton from Shashi in the past ten years, according to customs reports:</p>
<p>Year        Export Volume      Year        Export Volume</p>
<p>1921        11,000 dan         1926        652,052 dan</p>

<h3 id="e162">Indian-British Cotton Industry Weekly Report <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Bombay: Market prices were very strong last week due to the U.S. government's cotton report, which favored the bulls. At the beginning of the week, it was predicted that U.S. cotton would react and weaken, but after the price fell, local speculators bought heavily. Subsequently, U.S. cotton rose sharply, improving morale. The spot market was very strong. There was no progress in European demand, but exports to the Far East increased, with Japan purchasing heavily. Local factories also bought various types of Indian cotton. The following is a summary of last week's statistics (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1931    1932</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts from September 1st   3,383   2,012</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory                       605     770</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports from September 1st    2,454    919</p>

<p>To Other Regions                          28      38</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot sales increased last week, and futures followed U.S. cotton higher. On the day after the U.S. government's cotton report was released, this market did not experience a sharp rise due to the closure of the Indian cotton market. Subsequently, news of a favorable Indian cotton harvest boosted the bulls, U.S. cotton rose, and hopes for a recovery in silver prices further strengthened the market. Egyptian cotton also rose sharply along with U.S. cotton.</p>

<p>New Early Rice Drops by 3 Jiao</p>
<p>Supplies from various merchants in southern Shanghai continue to arrive in a steady stream, totaling about twenty or more boats. Sales in this street are brisker than yesterday. Buyers' sentiment is weary and turning hesitant. Prices for Changzhou, Wuxi, Northern Early Rice and similar varieties from Suzhou and Tongzhou are similar to previous levels. Early rice from Daoxiangzhuang continues to be handled, with the grains being hard and about an inch long. Another 1,500 shi of new early rice from Zhoupu has arrived, and the opening price this morning dropped by 3 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market in Xin Zha and West Road did not see many arrivals. Transactions in the city and countryside were not very lively. Changzhou, Wuxi Thick Early Rice maintained its price, and Zhongguan was quoted at two chi. Thin Early Rice sales were average, with no price increases or decreases. Changed to cloudy weather, and the buying and selling of silver dollars was quiet. The market is in a tired state. There are few foreign high-quality goods, and the situation is settled. The total volume for the day was about 3,000 shi.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Flour Generally Firm <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, generally showed a firm trend in various months. Although the price of foreign wheat was down another three or four jiao, the strong rebound in gold prices and the shrinking exchange rate kept the sentiment among outside investors positive. Buying interest from various parties was very active. Factories were releasing their stocks, and sales in the previous week were very brisk. Yesterday, few were released. Looking at the recent trend, factories, due to the accumulation of spot flour, are willing to sell off, unlike before when they were holding firm. However, buyers' appetite has turned stronger than before, so the market has become bullish. Due to the relocation to the new market, there were two fewer auctions in the morning, with over 300,000 bags sold. As a result, August and September futures were up 7.5 li compared to the previous weekend, October was up 1.25 fen, November was up 7.5 li, December was up 1.5 fen, and January was up 1.75 fen.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Stable</p>
<p>Grain Exchange Resumes Full-Day Trading Today</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in the morning, generally showed a stable trend in various months. The strong rebound in gold prices had a significant impact on the pricing of foreign wheat. Therefore, general sentiment was not greatly affected by the three or four jiao decrease in the price of foreign wheat. According to market analysis, prices must actually be cheaper, and the supply of native wheat must be sufficient to reassure people before sentiment can turn flat. Otherwise, it will be difficult to overcome the downward trend. As a result, this month's contract was up 2 fen compared to last week, September and October were up 1 fen, and November and December were unchanged. Spot wheat sales were quiet, with no activity. The Miscellaneous Grains Exchange will resume full-day auctions from the 16th.</p>

<p>Tunchi and Wuyuan Tea Market Coming to an End</p>
<p>Tea Merchants in Wuyuan Pessimistic About Losses</p>
<p>Before the Wuyuan tea merchants entered the market, they were all misled by the high prices offered by foreign merchants last year and expected the market this year to be even better than before. Therefore, even though the banks tightened exchange rates, they still tried every means to start trading. However, after the boxed tea was manufactured and transported to Shanghai, it remained unsold for a long time. The selling price of "Zhen Mei" (Precious Eyebrow) tea plummeted by several tens of liang. Tea warehouses, taking a cautious approach, stopped issuing receipts early. As a result, all the tea merchants felt financial difficulties. Fortunately, American firms showed increasing interest in tea from Wuyuan, and sales of various grades of tea have increased significantly in the past two weeks. The merchants have been able to alleviate their financial difficulties with the income from these distress sales. Some merchants with insufficient capital and unsold boxed tea are still struggling to pay the tea pickers' wages. Even with the recent sales, they still have to take a loss of ten to twenty liang per dan. People in the tea industry often express their concerns and worry about how to recover their losses.</p>
<p>Tunchi Tea Merchants Gradually Closing Down</p>
<p>Tunchi tea merchants were previously concerned about the bleak Shanghai market and the slow sales of boxed tea in Zong. They stopped purchasing new tea from various regions. This month, the Tunchi Zhen Mei varieties became popular, and merchants resumed purchasing in force, distributing 7,000 dan of raw tea accumulated in various tea shops. The market was revitalized. The merchants believe that although they suffered losses on previous sales, the tea purchased later was cheaper than before. The inventory in the Shanghai market is not large, and sales in Europe and America have not decreased. Therefore, they believe that the market will eventually rebound. With this outlook, they did not give up on purchasing new tea due to the temporary market downturn but rather seized the opportunity for future profits. Currently, merchants in Tunchi who have purchased less tea have closed down. About half of them are expected to be completed within this month. There are still about 10,000 boxes of new tea being processed and awaiting shipment.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Roadside Green Tea Holding Steady <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British and French firms continued to spare no effort to purchase Zhen Mei and needle-like green tea from Wuyuan, Tunchi, Suian, and other areas, and trading was brisk. Currently, the roadside green tea inventory is only about 28,000 to 29,000 boxes. Most of the tea factories in the inland areas have closed down, and the supply has gradually dried up. Based on these supply and demand principles, Chinese tea merchants are taking an increasingly firm stance. Yesterday, the market price for Wuyuan "Gongzheng" Zhen Mei (finest grade Zhen Mei) was 138 liang, and the price for hand-picked tea rose to 165 liang. The green tea market is showing a steady trend.</p>

<p>Raw and White Sugar Trading Slightly More Active</p>
<p>Problems Arise with Muscovado Exports</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market at the Sugar Association saw slightly more active trading. Dutch 24 grade raw white sugar saw substantial transactions at 14 liang 5 qian 5 fen, and Hong Kong sugar at 14 liang 3 qian 5 fen, showing a firm trend. 14 grade raw red sugar was at 12 liang 6 qian 5 fen, and 16 grade medium white sugar was at 13 liang 7 qian 5 fen. Although the volume of 8 grade Dutch red sugar at 10 liang 5 qian 6 qian was limited, the market also held firm. Taikoo sugar B mark was at 16 liang 2 qian 5 fen, HX mark at 15 liang 2 qian to 15 liang 1 qian 5 fen, H mark at 12 liang 5 qian 5 fen, and DY mark at 15 liang 5 qian, showing a stable market. A merchant at a trading post offered several hundred bags of 16 grade medium white sugar at 13 liang 7 qian 5 fen, but traders showed little interest, and the market was flat. Due to the Customs' inspection and re-assessment of domestic goods export tax on refined white sugar, many have been penalized, and there are rumors of confiscation, causing the movement of goods to temporarily cease. Therefore, the industry association convened a general meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<p>New Honey Dates Arrive in Large Quantities, Prices Fall</p>
<p>The previous market price for old honey dates had fallen to around 12 liang, but it has recently seen some recovery. However, new honey dates from Jiaxing have now appeared on the market. The first batch, only a few pieces, sold at a high price of 28 liang. Due to continued arrivals and increasing quantities, the market price has now fallen to 25 or 26 liang. According to usual practice, the morning market added to the退聞貨 (withdrawn goods). The market is showing signs of continued loosening.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>One act after another of a live drama is being performed on the political stage! The most recent act is called "Stiff, Stiff, Stiff."</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei and Zhang Xueliang, over the issue of the military expenses for Tang Yulin's troops in Rehe, and various other reasons, have suddenly put on a stern face! Wang has already declared his resignation, and is extremely resolute, with the meaning of "My heart is not a stone, it cannot be turned." This is called "one stiff." Zhang Xueliang has declared his resignation, and he has no choice but to resign. Ashamed of public opinion and guilty before heaven, why not leave? This is called "two stiff." The reasons for the break between Wang and Zhang are, of course, very complex. The issue of funds is only the overall cause for the break. All of it is focused on Tang Yulin in Rehe. Because of Tang's military expenses, two important figures from the north and south have resigned at the same time. I wonder what Tang feels in his heart? How will the future supply of funds be resolved? This is called "three stiff."</p>
<p>One stiff, two stiff, three stiff, is "stiff, stiff, stiff."</p>
<p>The situation of "stiff, stiff, stiff" will eventually be broken. I am not a politician, so I won't make predictions. I am only thinking of an antithetical couplet with the same rhyme! They are all words in the seventh "yang" rhyme:</p>
<p>Wang Zhang consult over Tang's funds, stiff, stiff, stiff.</p>
<p>Dear readers who like to read this column, why not create an antithetical couplet with the same rhyme?</p>
<p>If there is an antithetical couplet, then the awkwardness of "north of the house, a solitary deer shrinks; west of the stream, chickens crow together" will no longer be unique.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Reputation of Ye Huijun <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty, two civilians engaged in revolution and ultimately achieved success in Shanghai: Li Pingshu and Ye Huijun. Li passed away four years ago, and local people raised money to cast a bronze statue in his honor. Ye has also recently passed away, and various public organizations are holding a memorial service for him in recognition of his contributions to society. The speeches at the memorial service differed from ordinary platitudes. They were all sincere expressions of respect and admiration for Ye, and were worth recording. They are recorded below to commemorate the reputation of Ye in the eyes of the people of Shanghai. Wang Xiaolai said: "I have followed Mr. Ye for more than twenty years, and we have always encouraged each other to be honest and to see things through to the end. Two months ago, when I went to inquire about his illness, Mr. Ye still asked whether the gate installed in Nanshi was sturdy. The Council will be established, and councilors must make it their responsibility to seek the welfare of the local area. This shows that even when he was seriously ill, he was still concerned about local security. He can be said to be selfless and devoted to the public good." Pan Gongzhan said: "Mr. Ye always pointed to his chest during his speeches and said, 'With a clear conscience.' His commitment to the revolutionary cause, from the Qing Dynasty to the present, has never wavered. He always did what he could, never fearing difficulties, and never taking credit for his accomplishments. He always maintained an optimistic attitude. Those who lacked determination were inspired by his encouragement and rose to action. When I was the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, I was afraid of doing certain things and feared difficulties. Through his influence, I moved forward resolutely and was ultimately successful. The old man has now passed away, and the account of his clear conscience has been handed in. He can be said to be blameless before heaven and man." Lin Kanghou said that Mr. Ye's merits can be summed up in six words: "integrity, frugality, law-abiding, and responsibility." He had no savings after decades of revolution. He was always on time for even small banquets. Other things can be imagined. He never promised unless he could deliver, and once he promised, he would definitely do it. The combination of these three qualities is rare in modern times. Qu Shaoyi said that the common failings of people are "greed for petty gains and a desire to be in the limelight." Mr. Ye never profited from helping others. He practiced revolution without any party titles. He was straightforward and honest. He was truly a countryman from Pudong. The fact that Shanghai was able to hold such a memorial service for a countryman after his death shows his achievements can be imagined. Other eulogies are not recorded here.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Photo of Cannons <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Ge</p>
<p>When I unexpectedly found several cannons on Beacon Mountain (I only knew its name afterward), my relaxed mood suddenly became serious. I quickly set up my camera and took a picture with the big one.</p>
<p>There were a total of three cannons, two small ones and one large one. The large one was staring straight at the Yangtze River, which stretched like a belt. It was quietly crouching in a ground pit built of concrete, surrounded by concrete walls. The walls were full of deeply embedded bullet marks (the marks were about a foot high and six inches wide), and the size of the bullets could be determined from this. The small cannons were exposed to the sun, with their heads raised, looking like guard dogs.</p>
<p>At the moment of taking the picture, a strangely fragile heart seemed to be shocked by violence, and it kept pounding in my chest. I felt strangely like a spy with an unclear motive, and I was desperately afraid that the enemy would find out what I was doing. But I finally took the picture safely. I was happy! As happy as bullets in a burning ammunition depot, firing wildly in the weeds without a clue. But I was also as flustered as an ant on a hot pot, helplessly circling around.</p>
<p>The mountain was covered with yellow earth and weeds. The summer sun shone universally on it. There was no shade to be found, and even small shrubs were nowhere to be seen. Therefore, I did not meet anyone. However, I heard faint voices and discovered a tunnel next to the cannon pit. It must be very cool in the tunnel. The people guarding the cannon platform must be lying down and chatting.</p>
<p>On the way down the mountain, I still felt like a spy, so I hurried down. But when I stepped onto the wide and smooth street, I felt unhappy, because there was no one chasing after me and no one blocking my way ahead. As a result, I ended up thinking, "What if I really was a spy?" "What if...?"</p>

<p>— Hong Jingshan</p>
<p>Life is impermanent and death is inevitable. Why did you die so suddenly? Your laughter and words were just yesterday. The news of your death pierced my heart. I was already heartbroken by your haggard appearance. I thought you were recuperating by the sacred lake, and I missed your letters during our short separation. I thought of you countless times, but my plans to visit you were thwarted by circumstances. I was planning to celebrate your return, but who knew it would be our final farewell? A person of towering presence in my eyes is now buried under yellow earth. My heart is filled with worries and sorrows, and what can grass and trees do to help? The building collapses and cannot be rebuilt, and my tears fall like rain in my loneliness and coldness. Fortunately, you have a son who understands filial piety and learning, and your descendants will endure the bitterness and grief. Perhaps the heavens are impartial, and the gates to your grand mansion will open in the future. You were generous in your friendships, but how many people are truly as devoted as you? Floating in the ocean of humanity, how fortunate I was to have you as my friend. I withdrew from the mundane world and entrusted my heart to literature and history. The sound of silk and bamboo music brought me solace, but now it is mournful and heartbreaking. Your neighbors called you a kind person, but you did not care about such praise. I lament the loss of a rare talent for the world, and this is no exaggeration. With the closing of your coffin, you enter eternal rest. When will my tears ever cease?</p>

<p>Seven Thousand Five Hundred and One Times</p>
<p>The title of "World's Top Bridegroom" has recently been firmly claimed by a young man living in New York named Hibbert. A few days ago, he celebrated his seven thousand five hundred and first wedding there.</p>
<p>Although none of Hibbert's previous marriages ended in divorce, that is to say, he has never been divorced, he is not a bigamist. Although he gets married almost twice a day, he still believes that marriage is a permanent event in life and hopes that his most recent marriage will be the same.</p>
<p>This is because Hibbert's previous seven thousand and five hundred marriages were all performances on stage. He is a famous New York actor. Only his marriage to Miss Huilai this time is the first real marriage in his life!</p>
<p>Although Hibbert has extensive experience as a bridegroom, he privately practiced all the rituals several times before the wedding. The bride is also an actress who has now given up her stage career and is engaged in the stock business.</p>

<p>After a major war, there is bound to be a major epidemic. This spring, Japanese invaders ravaged the Songhu area, turning it into a war zone. The dead were piled high. After the war, it was difficult to thoroughly carry out burial and disinfection work. Now, in the height of summer and a long drought, an epidemic has spread. The worst hit area is Wuxi. Yesterday, I received a letter from a friend in Wuxi describing the epidemic. Reading it, I couldn't help but gasp in amazement. According to him, a farmer named Jia lived outside the east gate of Wuxi. His family of five was harmonious. One day, Jia's wife suddenly felt chest tightness and abdominal pain. She asked her son to call his father from the fields, as Jia was working as a hired laborer for his neighbor that day and had not yet returned home. The next day, near noon, a neighbor passed by his door and saw that the double doors were tightly closed and there was no sound. Remembering Jia's wife's sudden illness the night before, he became suspicious and broke into the house. He went straight to the bedroom and saw a mother and two sons dead in bed, and a father and a daughter collapsed on the ground. On the side of the wall, there was another person lying on their back. He was extremely shocked and ran to tell the neighbors. Onlookers gathered. After a joint investigation, it was confirmed that the deaths of Jia's family of five were due to a rapidly spreading strain of cholera. However, the person on the side of the wall, upon closer inspection, was recognized as someone from the village. The fact that the dead person died in Jia's house was puzzling. Later, a hole in the wall was discovered behind the厢房 (side room), and it was realized that the deceased was a petty thief who had broken into Jia's house. Unfortunately, he was also infected and died with them. How tragic! (Moved to donate to the Northeast Volunteer Army)</p>

<p>— Rui Yucheng</p>
<p>Tracing back to the Incident of January 28th, the industries of Shanghai withered and declined. Residents fled in droves. I also returned to my hometown. One evening, I was standing in front of my door with my wife and children when suddenly a destitute young man arrived. He was about twenty years old, looked mentally and physically exhausted, and had a sallow complexion. One could tell at a glance that he was an evacuee. He staggered towards us and suddenly knelt on the ground. He cried out with a pitiful voice, "Please save me, sir! This evacuee really has nowhere to go. It's a matter of life and death!" We felt compassion and brought him into our home. After asking about his situation, we learned that he was from Jiading. He had been doing business in Shanghai. When the Shanghai battle suddenly broke out, his business came to a standstill. Because he missed his mother, wife, and children in his hometown, he risked returning home. However, he was captured by the Japanese army halfway and forced to help transport bullets at the rear. But he was a frail merchant, how could he endure such hard labor? Moreover, he was not well-fed and suffered harsh beatings. Therefore, in less than two days, he was extremely haggard. One day, while carrying ammunition, he suddenly felt dizzy and fainted by the roadside. When he woke up, he realized that he was sleeping in a temporary hospital of the Red Swastika Society. Looking down, he saw a patch of bright red bloodstains on the front of his clothes. He assumed that he had fainted due to coughing up blood on the way, but he didn't know who had rescued him. Soon, after the doctor came to treat him, his mind became much clearer. He began to observe the other patients in the ward. Most of them were wounded soldiers. Only one ordinary patient was sleeping near him. Sometimes, a strong smell of kerosene would blow in with the wind, directly irritating his nose. It turned out that the patient in the bed next to him was a laborer from a kerosene store. His clothes were constantly emitting the unpleasant smell of kerosene. At first, he found this strange smell quite unbearable. But after a week, he became accustomed to it. However, he was eager to rejoin his family and did not wait for his body to fully recover before resolutely leaving the hospital. But at that time, Jiading had been completely occupied by the brutal army, and he could not return home. Moreover, he had no money and nowhere to stay. He had no choice but to beg along the way to make a living. He begged along the railway and unknowingly arrived at our hometown. I expressed extreme sympathy after hearing his story. When he said that he had nowhere to settle down and had become a beggar, my wife and I did not hesitate to let him stay temporarily in our home until the ceasefire, and he could then return to his hometown. Seeing our generosity, he was very grateful and said, "Thank you very much for your kindness in taking me in, sir. I will work as a servant in your house. But there is one condition: I don't want any wages, but I ask that you give me four taels of kerosene every day. I hope you will agree." I was very surprised to hear this and asked him what he wanted four taels of kerosene for. He couldn't help but shed tears and said, "Since leaving the hospital and being separated from the patient in the bed next to me, I have felt a strange pain in my mind. At first, I didn't know why. Later, I realized the reason. So I used the money I had begged to buy two taels of kerosene and inhaled its smell to my heart's content. After inhaling it, my spirits immediately improved. Therefore, I must inhale it every day. In the beginning, I just inhaled it. But after a few days, I felt like it wasn't enough. I even had to drink it. At first, I only drank one tael. Later, I gradually increased the amount. Now, I need to drink at least four taels to feel okay. Please forgive me." His unusual request made me half-believing and half-doubting. But to save someone, one must save them completely, so I agreed to his request. But I thought to myself that kerosene contains toxins. How can he eat it? From then on, I carefully observed him. Sure enough, I saw him eating kerosene every night. After eating it, he was full of energy and would chat with me, just like someone addicted to opium after smoking their fill. Sometimes, when he talked about his hometown, he would weep sadly. After a month, the Shanghai ceasefire agreement was signed. The Japanese army withdrew. I set off for Shanghai. He received the travel expenses that my wife gave him and also returned to Jiading.</p>

<h3 id="e176">A Few Words in Response to the Three Gentlemen <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>A few days ago, I made some remarks about expelling students studying in Japan, followed by three letters from Mr. Lian, Mr. Ren, Ms. Ruth, and Mr. Fan Xingnan, asking me to reply. The main point of their letters was, of course, to oppose my proposal. Even though they should not study in Japan, they insisted that they should study in Japan. Before writing this reply, I must first clarify two points: 1. This expulsion of students studying in Japan back to their country was done by the Japanese, not by me, nor by the Chinese government. 2. My proposal not to study in Japan does not refer to the past or the future, but to the period after the September 18th Incident until the end of Japan's policy of aggression.</p>
<p>I don't need to investigate whether the three gentlemen were former students in Japan, future students in Japan, or related to Japan or current students in Japan. However, to refute someone else's writing, one must first understand the topic and read the text carefully before speaking. My proposal not to study in Japan specifically refers to the period from the September 18th Incident until the end of Japan's policy of aggression, during which time one should not study in Japan.</p>
<p>Because of our country's own lack of progress, we have no choice but to study in various countries to obtain some relevant scientific knowledge. I have always acknowledged this. However, since the late Qing Dynasty, batches of students have gone to study in various countries, reaching tens of thousands of people, for decades, especially students studying in Japan. However, how much real knowledge have they brought back to contribute to their country? Alas! It is lamentable to say. But we cannot entirely blame the students. The instability of the political situation and the government's inability to make full use of their talents are also among the reasons. In the end, they only bought a few doctoral and bachelor's degrees, which were of no use. The value of studying abroad can thus be generally seen.</p>
<p>Mr. Ren said that every imperialist country is like Japan; they only haven't revealed their ferocious faces because the time hasn't come yet. (This idea is roughly the same in all three letters.) I also think there is some truth to this statement. However, Mr. Ren also admits that the ferocious faces of other countries have not yet been revealed. In fact, they have been revealed before. But when other countries will reveal them in the future, or to what extent they will reveal them, I am afraid Mr. Ren cannot guess. However, Japan's ferocious face has already been exposed. After the September 18th Incident last year, they launched an undeclared war and completely occupied my three northeastern provinces. That's not all; they are also coveting my Jehol and even have plans to invade Beiping and Tianjin. I ask you, can I say that the faces of other countries are so ferocious now?</p>
<p>There is another passage in Mr. Ren's letter that is both infuriating and laughable to read. It is not worth my refuting. I will just record it below for everyone to see such wonderful writing. The Japanese hate the Chinese as much as the Chinese hate the Japanese (How do you know this? Are you perhaps Japanese?). The Chinese reject the Japanese even more than the Japanese reject the Chinese (This is the fault of the Chinese). However, I have never heard a Japanese person say (This is the magnanimity of the Japanese): "We hate the Chinese. We will never go to China. We don't want the land of the three northeastern provinces. We will give up all the Japanese concessions and all rights in China. We will sever all relations with China forever." I don't think the Japanese are so stupid that they would say these words (These words are just something you came up with; clever, clever!). (To be continued)</p>

<p>Starting in chaos, ending in abandonment, condemned by the ancients. External troubles are raging, internal strife is increasingly fierce. I will now write a poem based on the theme of no title and in the spirit of a real event. Alas, it is lamentable.</p>
<p>For the love of seeking a phoenix, I played the zither, not hesitating to sell my compositions for gold. Floating clouds only earned the lover's dream, spilled water forever a forsaken woman's lament. New dancing sleeves, old fragrant quilt, new joy replaces the old feelings. At the ferry, who will ask about Peach Leaf? Where can one find lush Artemisia on the mountain?</p>
<p>No hope for a broken mirror to be reunited, where to go after being dismissed? Not hesitating to endure hardship and serve with broom and dustpan, who would have thought of separation and dividing the cooking stove? Wounded phoenix in the harbor, jealous eyebrows of a beautiful woman, sorrowfully listening to the cry of a pheasant flying to the court. Drifting duckweed is equally sad as flying catkins, can fallen flowers return to their old branches?</p>

<h3 id="e180">Electric Light Fishing Technique <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Nu</p>
<p>The underdevelopment of the Chinese fishing industry is due not only to the government's lack of protection, but also to the fishermen's lack of scientific knowledge, their reliance on outdated methods, and their failure to improve. If they continue to be self-contained and do not know how to improve, I am afraid that this last glimmer of hope will also follow in the footsteps of the silk industry and go bankrupt. In order to draw the world's attention to the fishing industry, I will now write about the electric light fishing method below.</p>
<p>(1) The Nature of Fish: Place a white porcelain plate in the middle of shallow, grassy water. When the fish see it, they think it is the reflection of the moon and jump into the plate. This is evidence that fish like bright light. Fishermen enter the sea naked, and soon fish come to them. This is another proof that fish like warmth. Since we know that fish like light and warmth, and electric lights have both of these qualities, we can make full use of them.</p>
<p>(2) Setting Up a Fish Trap: Next to the shallow sea, erect four wooden pillars at the four corners. The pillars should be about ten feet high (not counting the part that is in the mud). The pillars should be fourteen feet apart. The sides and bottom should be surrounded by bamboo. The bottom of the trap should be about four feet from the seabed. Then erect four iron pillars to strengthen the bamboo. At this point, the outline is complete. Then, on the four sides of the trap, make twenty or so doors, each one foot square. The doors should also be made of bamboo, crisscrossed like inverted whiskers, so that the fish can enter the trap but cannot leave. Hang a hundred-watt electric light in the middle of the trap. The bulb must be made of two layers of glass, so that the heated layer does not come into contact with cold water, to prevent it from bursting. The outer layer of glass is best to be light green, the same color as the water. The outside of the light is covered with a wire mesh to prevent large fish from breaking the light. At the bottom of the trap, make a hole about two feet square, equipped with a key that can be opened and closed freely. Below is surrounded by a large net. In this way, the fishing trap is completely finished.</p>
<p>(3) Other Equipment: Next to each fishing trap, a fish shed should be built for easy guarding. If the fishing area is far from the city, an engine must be prepared to supply electricity. A small fish transport boat is also an essential piece of equipment, because sailboats are helpless when they encounter head winds. By the time the wind is favorable, fishermen and merchants will have gathered, and market prices will plummet. Therefore, it is more convenient to transport by steamship.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Replying to Mr. Wen for the Article "Reforming Eating" <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Yiyi Hall Owner</p>
<p>Since I proposed the article "Reforming Eating" and published it in this publication, it seems to have attracted the attention of readers and has been discussed. First, Mr. Shuxia, and then Mr. Qixing, have published extensive discussions on this humble view of "Reforming Eating," each expressing their brilliant opinions. I am very impressed. However, the day before yesterday (the eleventh), I saw Mr. Wen's wonderful article "Reply to Reforming Eating." After reading it, I felt that there were misunderstandings in his words, so I added the following explanations to answer Mr. Wen's kind intentions.</p>
<p>Mr. Wen said in his article: "...I think that if there are people with pulmonary tuberculosis or other infectious diseases in a family, then everyone else should take extra precautions everywhere, and there is no need to reform eating..." Indeed, as Mr. Wen said, there is also a point. However, reading his tone, it seems that he misunderstood that the "Reforming Eating" that I proposed is limited to within a family. This view is not broad enough. It must be known that the "Reforming Eating" that I proposed is not only limited to within a family, but also within public institutions or groups where many people are together. It is especially necessary to "reform eating" there. Within a family, it is secondary.</p>
<p>Mr. Wen also criticized my point that "In recent years, the Chinese have been doing everything in the European style," which is also not without misunderstanding. He said: "...Where is the Europeanization? Everything is still subject to invasion and dependent on others. The only things that have been Europeanized are open social gatherings and men and women dancing and all the romance!..." Indeed, that's right. The Chinese people's Europeanization is only like this. How can it not be heartbreaking! How can it not make Mr. Wen so agitated that he even suspects that I sympathize with this Europeanization! How dare I? Mr. Wen is so distressed by the Europeanization of the Chinese, which is truly commendable! However, things have good and bad aspects. The so-called Europeanization also has things that can be learned and things that cannot be learned, which cannot be confused. Mr. Wen asked me: "...What is Europeanization? And what is Europeanization?" This is a very good question, and it is not worth answering. However, since Mr. Wen kindly asked, I cannot bear to reject his kind intentions. I will answer it tentatively, and I hope Mr. Wen will listen. You must know that the Europeanization that I am talking about is, of course, good Europeanization, Europeanization that can be learned. As for the questions "...What is Europeanization? And what is Europeanization?" The meaning of these two sentences is actually one and two, and two and one. Europeanization is the example of the customs and sentiments of European and American countries. The reason why I said "In recent years, the Chinese have been doing everything in the European style" is only because I am saddened by the fact that the Chinese people in recent years have been so diligently learning the bad examples that Mr. Wen mentioned above (but people who learn those bad examples regard them as good examples). So, the meaning of my words is: "Since the Chinese have been doing everything in the European style in recent years, instead of specializing in learning those bad Europeanizations that they think are good, it would be better to reform the eating habits and change to the 'separate eating' principle of one dish per person. It seems to be more beneficial and harmless than learning those bad Europeanizations." This implicit meaning is only because I was too concerned about the space of this publication at the time and did not elaborate, but kept it simple, which caused Mr. Wen to misunderstand and kindly ask me, which is really unexpected. However, Mr. Wen's heartfelt and elegant intentions for the times are truly abundant!</p>
<h3 id="e182">Reforming Education <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Xinxi</p>
<p>I am a student and have not been involved in society at all. I am not qualified to talk about social reform issues. However, I cannot resist your association's enthusiasm for social reform, and your association's right to submit articles is not limited to members, so I shamelessly offer my humble opinion.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the relationship between education and society, so there is no need to say more. Schools can be compared to many factories, and society is a large store. Of course, we are all goods produced in factories. No product does not go through the store, just as no student does not enter society. As for our customers? Of course, it is also the vast masses.</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at our sales. How many school graduates are able to find a job? Is it possible to say that supply exceeds demand when thousands of limited students are inserted into this huge society every year? Then how are the 95% of literate people in Western countries placed? This has to be said to be the failure of education. Try to investigate how many graduates of large and middle schools are studying agriculture? How many are studying industry? How many are studying medicine? How many are studying other practical industries? Compared with studying literature, law, politics, and art, it is truly insignificant.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Nantong Textile School was recruiting in Shanghai, and my brother Lin also went to take the exam. It is said that there were only thirty or fifty applicants. According to the person in charge of the school: "Last year, there were more than twenty graduates from the school, and the social demand was several times that number. Who says that there is an oversupply of college students in the garret?"</p>
<p>One or two months ago? The newspapers and periodicals said that Mr. Chen Guofu submitted an education reform proposal to the Central Committee, saying: "Since the rise of new education in our country, school courses have emphasized literature, grammar, and art while neglecting agriculture, industry, and medicine. This kind of abnormal development has led to a gradual increase in unemployment, creating various unstable states in society. At the same time, we also feel a lack of talent, and we sit idly by and watch the construction industry stagnate." This kind of social phenomenon is recognized by everyone, but who created this abnormal situation? Those who run education should certainly be responsible, but the fundamental psychological errors of the scholars themselves cannot escape blame. This kind of psychology is:</p>
<p>(1) Chinese people have always regarded becoming an official as the only way out for studying. This feudal ideology is still deeply rooted in people's hearts.</p>
<p>(2) Most young people are old before their time and like to make morbid moans, or are self-styled romantic and delve into love affairs, thinking that they can be playboys for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>(3) They are too self-important and regard practical industries as minor paths, not enough to save the country and secure the people.</p>
<p>Seeing the news that those who passed the higher civil service examination voluntarily returned their diplomas, are some of those who are obsessed with politics also aware? The Chinese political arena is originally a place where a new emperor comes with a new courtier. Do you ask yourself if you have the qualifications to intervene? Wake up! Let's change the slogan:</p>
<p>Go into the real industry world!</p>
<p>Our country has a large amount of virgin land that needs to be developed!</p>
<p>Our country has a large amount of raw materials, and semi-finished products need to be refined!</p>

<h3 id="e183">Issuing Letters of Appointment <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Xia</p>
<p>This is really the education world in China suffering from tuberculosis! How can it be considered a strange phenomenon of School A?!</p>
<p>The time is already August 31st! The letters of appointment for all teachers and staff of School A have not yet been issued! Because the principal has changed again.</p>
<p>Poor teachers and staff who change every half a year are still waiting for their letters of appointment and can't help but feel anxious! Although two or three have already received verbal "reservation tickets" from the new principal, they are not completely stable!</p>
<p>Those who are flexible in nature go to great lengths to ask people to introduce them to the principal again and move around in all directions. Of course, the result is in the hands of others, and they have to run around very diligently! Those who are upright in nature only know to adhere to the principle of "stay if it fits, leave if it doesn't fit" and don't understand what is called activity!</p>
<p>The principal is also really embarrassed. He originally wanted to keep a few good old teachers. However, how can he deal with the superiors' notes and letters of recommendation? Surrounded by relatives and friends, it is difficult to reject everything. The time can no longer be delayed. Finally, he selected two or three of the original teachers and staff who had the most letters of recommendation and hired them, and dismissed all the others. The principal's difficulties were only half relieved.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the upright old teachers would never be so shameless as to make things difficult for the principal. Those who got the "reservation ticket" but could not actually get it could only lament their misfortune!</p>
<p>This is called the education world being more "difficult" than all other worlds!</p>

<h3 id="e184">Plague God <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Tao</p>
<p>Recently, the epidemic has been rampant, and there is unease everywhere. Citizens have been holding peace ceremonies one after another, chanting scriptures and praying, burning hell money and paper foil, hoping to send away the plague god immediately. In fact, the real plague god is not some ferocious ghost or god, but a small, well-known flying insect. That flying insect is the fly that disturbs our peace every day.</p>
<p>Speaking of flies, who doesn't hate them for being too dirty? It is indeed a great plague god that spreads epidemics. This plague god flies between feces and garbage heaps, sucking up decaying corpses and rotten things. These decaying corpses and rotten things are full of countless poisonous bacteria, such as cholera bacteria, dysentery bacteria, typhoid bacteria, tuberculosis bacteria (ie, tubercle bacilli), etc. After the fly is full of these filth filled with poisonous bacteria, it flies to our home. It is indeed a gluttonous little animal. When it sees our food, it stops on it and spits out all the filth it ate before, and then eats the newly discovered food. Moreover, it likes to vomit, often spitting out what it has eaten, and then eating it again. Therefore, in places with many flies, we often see dirty marks vomited by flies on the walls. If we eat the poisonous bacteria vomited by the flies, we will get sick immediately. Its body, except for its two wings, is covered with steel hair, especially on its feet. These hairs are the best tools for spreading germs. It has been calculated that a fly carries between 4,400 and 290,000 germs, including the terrible cholera bacteria, dysentery bacteria, typhoid bacteria, tuberculosis bacteria, diphtheria bacteria, anthrax bacteria, etc.</p>
<p>If an epidemic is discovered in a place, it will spread throughout the city within a few days. The spreader is not a ghost or god, but a fly. It flies from one family to another, from garbage cans and latrines to people's food, spreading that terrible plague. Therefore, if we want to drive away the plague god, we must first exterminate the flies.</p>
<p>The reproductive power of flies is truly amazing. In summer, when the weather is good, it only takes eight or nine days for a fly to turn from a small egg into an adult. Three days later, the newly emerged fly will lay eggs again. A fly, from the beginning of May to the end of August, calculated in four months, its offspring are 191,010,000,000,000,000,000, which is a situation where there is no end to killing. A good defense method is to drive them out of the house, and all windows and doors should be closed with iron gauze to prevent flies from entering the room. But iron gauze is expensive, and the cost of one door is twenty or thirty gold, which poor families cannot afford. Then, cover all food with iron gauze covers, and do not allow flies to feed on it. Killing them with fly swatters or fly traps is also very effective. As for exterminating maggots, lime can be sprinkled on feces. In cities, garbage cans are most likely to attract flies, so garbage cans should be closed, and all waste, such as watermelon rinds and rotten leftovers, should not be discarded next to garbage cans at will to prevent maggots from breeding.</p>
<p>Children's dysentery in autumn is the most terrible. Every year, countless babies die from children's dysentery. This dysentery is mostly spread by flies. Parents should pay attention to the milk of infants and should not allow flies to feed on it.</p>
