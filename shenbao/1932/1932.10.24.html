<h3 id="c1">日本外交賬之淸算 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>翰</p>
<p>日本最近之外交政策。已從消極的退。出國聯論。一變而爲積極的參加國聯論。而其派赴日内瓦充任折衝樽俎之使者。乃爲前任滿蒙副總裁。現政友會之要角。號稱滿蒙通之松岡洋右。</p>
<p>松岡洋右之爲人國人知之者衆可以繪聲繪影國人若非健忘當亦憶及一二八事變中。松岡洋右嘗潛來滬濱。寄寓於華懋飯店。負有游說僑滬。外人之使命乎。彼之主張。盡爲田中奏章之註脚。謂日本之東亞門羅主義。必須得列强之承認。而中國領土上之滿蒙問題。中國實無干涉之資格。其說之謬悖。固不待論。今松岡洋右已負同樣之使命。啓程赴日内瓦矣。</p>
<p>松岡洋右在東京日比野公會之歡送席上。已傾談其西行之使命其說之謬悖。一似曩昔。而更變本加厲。國人聞之能不髮指松岡洋右之言曰。[就外交關係而言。吾人必須將二十年來之舊賬一爲結算。]而其淸算舊賬之方式。則純以日本之國策爲主幹。而自九一八瀋變以來。日本一手所演成之劇幕。連續不斷。莫非淸算方式中必有之程序。誠如稻原勝治之所言。（見外交時報六月號轉回之我國外交）[滿洲事變之經過。與滿洲國之成立。爲日本]</p>
<p>對於國際外交之淸算。尤其爲對華方面各種懸案之解决。]然則松岡洋右之舊賬淸算論。殆非松岡洋右一人之放言。而爲日本朝野一致之呼聲。</p>
<p>據松岡洋右之演說。此行赴日内瓦。固爲[應付滿蒙問題。]而其使命之目的。則在［率直的對歐美人民表顯日本之精神。與日本人民之作爲。］而[滿蒙問題]至於今日。皆爲[日本精神]之表顯。[依於滿洲國之成立。及日本之承認···問題至此已經結束。]已不必再勞國聯之解决。至松岡洋右在最近之將來出席國聯其使命僅在[充分說明自去秋以來日本所取之舉]</p>
<p>動及態度皆爲公正而合法。]其公正合法之根據松岡洋右亦已有簡略之說明。日本[爲國家之生存計。並恪遵明治以來相沿之國家政策。此項政策。]</p>
<p>乃以保障東方之完整爲原則者。所謂東方。今指中國而言。中國目下乃在大混亂狀態之中。欲保障中國之和平。祇有一法。即確行日本之國家政策。]日本之國家政策爲何。曰田中義一奏章中所謂[欲征服世界必先征服中國。欲征服中國必先征服滿蒙。]行見松岡洋右於最近之將來。在雷茫湖畔。白峯銀色與碧潔湖光互相輝映中。昭示其日本國策於世界矣。</p>
<p>松岡洋右之議論。雖三尺之童。亦能知其荒謬。固不必再待吾人之痛駁。其說之依據。一言以蔽之。爲詭辯派之嫡系。其說之猖狂。雖詭辯派再生。亦歎勿及。而詭辯派之中心學說。［强權即公理。］日本非但奉若圭臬。而成爲日本國策之基礎。且已恭謹而實踐之。松岡洋右使命之目的。不啻爲[强權即公理]作擁護從此世界上迷信强權者。可以盡揭其和平之假面具。而國聯之約章亦須加以一番根本之修正。所有[公理]字樣。皆當一律改爲[强權。]所有九國公約非戰公約等一切和平條約均當一筆勾銷。如此則日本之國策方可進行而無阻蓋在松岡洋右以及其所代表之日本政府。固視日本國策之確定。無非爲世界和平謀保障。中國不亡。則日本不休。日本不休。則世界不安。然則欲饜日本之慾。使世界得安。除非滅亡中國不可。</p>

<p>華北各要人擬磋商一調解辦法</p>
<p>（南京）魯戰迄將匝月、中央提出皓電辦法後韓復榘忽電中央呈請辭職、政府方面决定加以慰留、但所指定之劉珍年五縣防地、必須韓確定遵照、不再攻擊、明日行政院將討論覆韓電、一方挽留其勿辭、同時務請確遵中央命令、將軍隊停止進攻、不得再越濰縣以東、以維大局云、聞韓復榘有間接電致京、希望中央對於劉珍年以駐軍地位干涉民政、加以申斥、俾省主席面子得以下去、並望再令劉部將掖縣併讓出、則韓允立即收兵回省、用紓中央東顧之憂、（二十三日專電）</p>
<p>（濟南）宋子文電韓文曰、韓主席向方兄勛鑒、眞密、頃讀吾兄致府院馬電、驟悉吾兄有倦勸之意、値茲外患日亟、内憂未已、吾兄坐鎭東魯、責任尤爲重大、中樞倚畀極殷、决不任吾兄高蹈、千祈勿萌退志、共濟時艱、至所盼禱、如弟子文叩養、（二十三日專電）</p>

<p>（南京）中央對川事、主張先行停止軍事行動、第二步再討論善後辦法、遂寗會議與治川綱要、原則上可不反對、俟雙方實行停戰後、將以上兩點、歸併在解决川事辦法之中、向各方徵集意見、此項主張、如何方不願接受、中央即當用有效方法、嚴厲處置、派員入川一事、在戰事未停前、將不成爲事實、（二十三日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）軍界人談、川事雖經中央主管軍事機關迭電勸告、但雙方尙各逞意氣、趨於極端、勸阻勢難有效、惟有聽其自然變化、俟其交綏結果、雙方皆勢窮力蹙、弱點畢露、然後政府再以相當力量、秉公處置、判别曲直、科以責任、有不服者、以法律制裁之、庶易爲功、總之不顧大局、閱牆是爭、不啻自入崩潰之絕境、自促其消滅也、（二十三日專電）</p>
<p>（香港）劉文輝號電覆執部政會、謂國難方殷何敢操戈同室、近頃好亂有人、無端肇釁、但輝仍遵電令、飭部固守原防、靜候中央解决、若得共相遵守、固禱祝以求、（二十三日專電）</p>

<p>上列海軍比率表、即英國五、美國五·六九、日本七·○一、故日本之潛水艦勢力、遙駕於英美兩國之上、特隨伴之主力艦隊行動、日本之保有量、尤爲優勝、艦數之比率、日本之八·四、適當於英美合計之數、噸數比率、日本之七·六七、亦當於英美合計之八·七五、以二者共計之、日本之八·二五、即與英美合計之八·六、故日本與英美之實勢力、互相頡頏、然而英美兩國、原爲造艦技術之先進國、何以彼二國之海軍勢力、反比我日本爲遜耶、此因歐洲大戰後日本較英美得於德國之長爲多耳、如上所述、美國潛水艦之數、雖比日本爲多、而其缺點之多、早在美國海軍司令官口中露出、所謂（Their　design　is　obsolete　and　faulty)與（There</p>
<p>is　not　the　least　doubt　that　the　Submarine　branch　of　the　Japanese　Navy　is</p>
<p>efficient　bighly　trained,and　form　double,)等語、足以證明矣、由此觀之、海戰中之主要戰鬥器之能力、我日本已無慮矣、</p>
<p>（乙）空軍問題　未來之太平洋戰爭、最可恐怖者爲空軍、蓋一旦開戰、彼或不藉海軍之力、而用空軍猛襲我日本各地、然美國飛機欲襲擊日本本土、須有陸上之航空基地、而美國之航空基地山德波英得·洛司非爾特、恐不易飛近日本、雖其飛機術如何發達、飛機如何繁多、但恐不能越太平洋四千海里、假令由夏威夷而至日本、亦達三千四百海里之長距離、豈能直接威脅我（日本）方乎、茲就列强之空軍力、比較如下、</p>
<p>英國　英國約有軍用飛機千八百架、又有民用飛機約九百架、該國於一九三○年計畫擴張空軍、擬將本國防備用獨立中隊增加至五十二中隊、</p>
<p>美國　美國有硬式飛行船二臺、海軍機約千架、陸軍機六百架、目下正謀第二擴張計畫、預定再增加海軍機千架、陸軍機千八百架、而海軍方面之預算、尙未成立俄國　俄國有飛行船二臺、飛機千六百架、預備至一九三三年末、編成二百二十中隊、增至二千二百架、其使用於極東方面者約五百架、</p>
<p>意國　意大利現有飛機千九百架、又有民用飛機五百架、</p>
<p>日本　陸軍方面之常備機五百八十架、最近整備約三百架、陸軍當局計畫至明年度、陸上部隊編爲十七隊、增加百三十六架、與艦上飛機○○架（譯者按據去年日報所載、九一八事變後、日軍佔領東北飛機塲時、日人奪去百七十三架、此項飛機、大半爲德美最新式之機、）</p>
<p>由以上觀之、空軍實力、我（日本）較他國爲弱、但軍縮會議時、對於擴張空軍、並無何等限制、今後各國空軍擴充至如何程度、正未可限量也、倘日美發生戰爭、我軍除破壞英美聯合艦隊合同外、被時不得不變更攻勢防禦策略、轉而爲進攻的作戰、即借空軍與潛水艦協力、一方開始索敵行動、他方由加姆却克海經由阿里地安羣島、阿拉斯加、而趨加拿大美大陸、蓋一達阿拉斯加、我（日本）空軍即有着陸停機塲、同時我方（日本）亦須防敵方之空中攻擊、現我國預料大戰時可分四方之飛機襲來、即</p>
<p>東方······越太平洋而來之美國艦隊、利用天候、迫近日本海之敵航空母艦與搭載飛機之軍艦、向我（日本）國土轟炸、或與我主力艦隊决戰時、施行空中攻擊、</p>
<p>西方······由中國大陸飛向我國襲擊、因中國大陸有無數之飛機塲、一旦開戰、日本陸軍一方向中國進攻、他方謀佔領香港斐律賓等處、此時中國必加入作戰、中國受英美等國之援助、亦必派遣飛機渡海襲擊、</p>
<p>南方······此即聯合東西兩方面、絕斷日本與台灣之交通、將由斐律賓馬尼剌新加坡等根據地、向北襲擊、</p>
<p>北方······北方之蘇俄、如嚴守中立、則可無顧慮、否則我必陷於非常之苦境、</p>
<p>目下吾人爲防禦空軍之襲擊、防空機關力究妥善方法、將來開戰時、爲防患未然計、當先謀破壞敵之根據地、例如對於海上之敵機、竭力擊破其運送飛機之航空母艦與軍艦、在中國大陸方面、戰爭一發、預先佔領其地、同時由空中轟炸敵方之各種施設、又令外征軍奪取敵之航空根據地、至於滿洲方面、照地形與距離關係上、殊不易向我（日本）在滿之施設上加以空中襲擊也</p>
<p>綜上而觀、日本對英對美之太平洋大海戰、其結局之勝敗、究如何歟、一言以蔽之曰、全在於我軍之能否破壞英美艦隊之合同是也、查彼我艦隊勢力之比較、相差無幾、倘日本作戰之巧妙、能擊破英美之主力艦巡洋艦時、則西太平洋之决戰、即可卜勝敗之運命、南太平洋之戰塲、如能分離敵艦之聯合、用奇襲部隊邀擊之、或可期勝、但我（日本）之主力部隊、分派各處、不免分散勢力、萬一不能適時適地集結時、則我（日本）將陷於不堪設想之境矣、（以上參譯池崎忠孝太平洋戰略論、與石丸藤太日本對世界戰爭）、</p>

<p>曁南足球隊昨以三比零擊敗上海西人隊於中華棒球場、觀者四五千人、曁南小試鋒芒、卽操勝券、良以目下之西人隊、實力較差、攻守均覺軟弱、加以大將辛克萊上次與威德希戰而受傷、昨日未能出塲、尤覺減色不少、</p>
<p>曁南射門稍差　昨日曁南之表演、似未盡其所長、工作亦未見緊凑、良以後方安然無事、殊少險象、前鋒亦時有大意從事之處、射門不凖、屢失機會、前鋒動作稍覺遲緩、進至敵門前每不能利用機會、破門建功、如能注意此點、該隊實有厚望焉、昨日之西人隊、前鋒力量殊薄弱、後方每未見鞏固、守門尙佳、史篤克改任中堅、頗爲努力</p>
<p>羅海光奏美技　三時開賽、曁南先攻、卽全力撲進、將西人會球門四面包圍、但苦戰無機、不得其會、後陳鎭和造成攻門機會、正擬一舉而下、但乃弟鎭祥趨於越位、負負而已、俄而陳鎭和在敵人脚上搶球而出、遠送前方、鎭祥海光洪寳大試其剪刀陣、你來我去、彼此傳遞、使敵人不易捉摸、以待時機之來、久而久之、卒被羅海光在門之右斜角急射一球、應聲入網、殊爲美觀、</p>
<p>王南珍之妙射　西人會右翼一度孤軍深入、無攻而還、陳鎭和再引兵進攻、見左方空虚、將球遠遞過去、左翼新將軍王南珍還送門前、陳鎭祥在無人處安然得球、但操之過急、射門不中、演成野球、曁南以攻勢之猛、故射門之機會極多、羅海光三次機會、均不得逞、三次猛射、均越門而過、殊爲可惜、陳鎭和看凖梅洪實、送出之角球、對門頭頂、又被接、曁南一再失機、固甚惋惜、但余軍精神奮發、力戰不懈、陳鎭和調度得法、羅海光從中擺渡、王南珍對門力射、球勢銳急、穿入網窩、美妙無比、是球之得、可謂諸前鋒聯絡之成功、其射門之佳、更見生色、上半時曁南以二比零終、</p>
<p>墨炭如願以償　小黑炭陳鎭和調度全軍、勞苦功高、但每不能指揮如意、抱負莫展、在下半時之二十分鐘時、墨炭奮鬥抗敵、破過三關、深入敵營、得羅海光之傳球、一舉成功、遂成三與零之比數、嗣後海光等一再猛攻、黑炭又射一球、未能奏功、梅洪寳屢與敵人開玩笑、頗少建樹、下半時之形勢、致在平淡中過去、</p>

<p>威德夏九比二勝</p>
<p>上半時各得兩球</p>
<p>丨甲組足球一幕丨</p>
<p>優游足球隊、昨以二比二和勁旅英軍威德夏於逸園、但是爲上半時之結果、下半時優游竟一失千里爲敵連中七球、造成九比二之結果、是爲西聯甲組比賽、觀者寥寥無幾、皆黃毛碧眼外國丘八、</p>
<p>優游失機不少　優游之各個技能尙可、而全隊合作之工夫、實太差、傳球來去、不能捉住其方向及距離、恒爲敵軍所截得、動作甚慢、政使大好機會失於交臂、上半時在門前可攻射之球不少、失去不勝可惜、表演當以朱璆錢耀彬爲最佳、饒惠生惜老將已老、奔走不速、爲敵軍漏入不少、</p>
<p>威德夏之觀察　感德夏球隊、下半時中、大顯其實力、確爲强勁之師、最可取者、個個脚頭挺硬、碰碰有聲、五鋒下半時如生龍活虎、兩翼之左右射、凖確無比、中線亦佳、後衛稍差、守門則時慌張之弱點、恒以手將球擲出、此法危険不可靠、</p>
<p>優游鬬成和局　上場優游則進攻敵門、機會甚佳、以合作差欠爲人救出、十五分鐘時、柯克左翼之傳球、中鋒倍格爾、一頂而進、十分鐘後、依樣葫蘆、歐爾攻門、梁跳起欲接、倍格爾頭來過速、又爲頂入、成軍以二比零先勝、尙有十五分鐘、孫惠賠在左得球、欲射未射、中鋒射中、守門擲出、朱璆趕來一送、直抵門中、守門接得按住、奚巧生趕來、球已越白線、判爲中球、最後之七分鐘、奚巧生帶球直進、疊破數關、急傳左翼、陣地空虚、孫惠培射入、上半時成二比二之和局、</p>
<p>力盡一失千里　上半時之驚人結果、萬料不及、下半時之不可收拾、其所以如此者、一言蔽之、上半時禦敵過烈、至此力盡、門前乃成敵軍世界、二十分鐘中、連失四球、（一）許蘭、（二）海恩斯、（三）歐爾、（四）海恩斯、此後一次拾得之十二碼球、竟爲孫惠培犠牲、最後又失球三次、（一）倍格爾、（二）帕爾謨、（三）倍格爾、九比二完畢、</p>

<p>總計上海勝三組、香港勝兩組、</p>

<p>劉盤據膠東干涉民政</p>
<p>韓輕啓戰禍亦不可恕</p>
<p>新聲社云、南開大學校長張伯苓氏、前日由京來滬、向廢止内戰大同盟會報告赴魯調停韓劉戰事之經過、新聲社記者、昨訪張氏新惠中旅舍、詢以魯戰情形及前途、張氏答覆如下、</p>
<p>盤據膠東　劉珍年部雖號稱一師、實則兵卒數萬、數年來盤據膠東十二縣、任免地方官吏、其餉糈即就地取給、韓復榘主省政後、竭力統一全省行政、膠東地方長官、雖逐漸由省政府任命、至劉軍月餉、經軍政部何部長核定爲十七萬元、每月由中央撥發十萬元、魯省協餉七萬元、後魯省府復允增至十萬元、但劉珍年則堅持須魯省協餉十五萬元、幾經磋商、僅允减至十四萬五千元、否則仍就防地取給、於是戰禍起矣、</p>
<p>集中三縣　劉珍年部對戰事早有準備、在掖縣萊陽即墨三縣屯聚糧𥞊、�</p>
<p>建築防禦工程、故戰事一起、劉軍即放棄其他各地、退守三縣、韓軍則取包圍形勢、余（張氏自稱下同）抵濟南時、韓復榘已在濰縣、即發電告將前往會晤、翌日蔣伯誠自濰縣回、謂不必前往、韓氏即將返濟矣、乃在濟候韓返、會晤時勸以在此國難嚴重時期、萬不宜内戰、以資敵國藉口、韓亦深以爲然、惟爲忝主省政、不能任膠東人民爲劉氏蹂躪而已、會中央派范李二委亦抵魯調查、而實際上亦已入相持局面、余即雖魯、</p>
<p>解决關鍵　平心而論、韓復榘治魯政績及軍紀、尙有足稱、與劉珍年在膠東之所爲、自不相能的幷論、然不請命於中央、遽動干戈、而啓戰禍、吾人亦不態爲韓氏恕也、現韓復榘堅主劉部離開魯省、以常理而言、劉部旣爲國軍、劉駐防何地、中央自有權衡、萬不容地方長官有所愛惡、其問題所在、應以不干民政爲關健、始爲正當、將來解决辦法、當亦以劉部縮小防區、不干民政爲依歸也、</p>
<p>明日北返　張氏此次南下、爲出席敎育部召集之體育會議、（二十日閉幕）在滬作四日勾留、除出席廢止内戰大同盟會及體育協進會會議外、上海中學（前日）務本女中（今日）立校紀念、均請氏演講、南開大學校友會、昨午在八仙橋靑年會歡宴、酬酢演講、甚爲忙碌、明日下午、即行北返、</p>

<p>二、鄙人所謂程序、不僅指董事會開會時所經實用以處理事務之方法、鄙人用此字樣、係以槪括董事會所用以决議、並使其决議發生效力之方法、易詞言之、卽董事會所用各種方法、以使其事務井然不紊、並使能盡其爲統治公共租界之負責團體所有職責、幷以控制大規模之行政機關、此種機關、爲由主要職員指揮以辦理市政之各處所組成、而可用以求達行政之目的者、三、董事會現有董事十四人、外董九人、華董五人、按照一八六九年所通過之地產章程、董事人數、［至多九人、至少五人］、（第十欵）、［開會時以有董事三人出席爲法定人數、］（第二十二欵）、但因加入華董三人一案、經於一九二六年納稅人大會通過、並於一九二八年四月、第一次實行、董事人數乃增爲十二席、至一九三○年五月、又通過一案、贊同增加華董二人、董事會計共有董事十四席、此卽現有董事之席數、雖以有董事三人出席爲足法定人數之地產章程第二十二欵、向未作廢、但現行之董事會規則、則以有董事九人出席爲足法定人數、（註二）</p>
<p>四、有頗爲重要而須記憶者一層、卽董事會之現行程序、爲適應一種團體需要而得之經驗所演成、就該團體之大部歷史而論、其人數未嘗有逾九人者、董事會會議通常所率由之程序、或可稱爲一小規模執行團體之非正式程序、其長處在於自由及簡便、設使情况順利、且能在短時間内、以最簡易之手續、處理極多之事務、但現所遵循之方法、除或可引起任何其他指摘外、其殆不足以適應二十人以上所組成團體之需要、殊爲顯而易見、蓋如一面求相當之時間經濟、一面欲使各個董事得有發表意見之充分機會、則二十餘人董事之辯論、其必以出之以較爲正式之性質、殆爲事所難免、</p>
<p>甲、委員會制度之利益</p>
<p>五、鄙人以爲、有一種定則頗穩妥、卽行政團體之規模愈大、則爲維持其效率起見、其須準備將其工作委託委員會辦理之限度亦愈廣、委員會人數較少、能將各項問題之詳情、透澈研究、對於較不重要之問題、得逕予最後决定、遇有爲所授權力未經准許最後决定之各種問題、則可繕具詳細報告、連同應如何辦理之確定建議、遞交較大之前項行政團體、</p>
<p>此項定則、對於一種團體、如公共租界工部局之董事會者、尤爲　用、蓋除在監督一偉大組織方面所牽涉之普通行政問題外、董事會尙有關於下策之各種困難問題、故常不能專用其大部份時間、以注意各辦公處之詳細狀况、</p>
<p>六、關於所擬董事會辦事程序之任何改革、鄙人以爲、其需注意之主要問題、似爲委員會制度之問題、此種問題、牽涉以下諸點之考量、（一）董事會之工作、應如何分配於各委員會、委託於各委員會之權力、其限度爲何若、（二）各委員會與各處處長之關係如何、（三）委員會遞交董事會之報告、其程氏與性質各爲何若、董事會會議討論各委員會報告時、應遵循何種程序、</p>
<p>七、本報告書第五編曾經提及、就處理董事會之事務而論、現經運用委員會制度至何限度、（註三（、並經提出關於似宜改革之某某數項建議、（註四）、</p>
<p>八、在上文所提之各節中、有一節曾言、[依照現行辦法、不能獲得委員會制度之充分利益、]（註五）、委員會制度充分進展所可期望之主要利益如何、以及享受此種利益之現有限制何若、將此兩項問題簡約考量、當甚利便、</p>
<p>九、尋常適用於市府工作之委員會制度、其意義在將市議會所有工作、由其議董分組擔承、每組卽爲一委員會、如此辦理乃使對於市府各部份之行政、得有充分之監督與控制、同時並使一大部份之瑣碎事務、爲人數較少之委員會所能措置盡善者、不必由全體市議會辦理、</p>
<p>一零、委員會制度倘經運用而卓著成效、其主要利益、可槪述如下、</p>
<p>（一）分工辦理、此種辦法、一面節省全體董事會之時間、一面使董事會對於其行政各機關、得經由各委員會、而維持充分之監督與控制、在各委員會委員常常互相商榷、及與有關係之各處處長商洽之際、各該委員乃獲得特殊機會、以熟諳其所主管方面之工部局事務、</p>
<p>（二）辦事迅速、凡爲各委員會有權最後决定之事項、可以立卽實行、而無庸待董事會之認可、（三）一切重要事項、最著者如關於大宗支出或一般政策之問題等、旣先經委員會初步審查、而後提出董事會、當可得有更完秘且更充分之考量、故凡爲必需董事會裁定之要務、在最後决定之前、至少經考量兩次卽首由委員會考量、次由董事會考量、使尋常董事會之召集、催以應付委員會報告所提出之問、題、足使董事會之决議、得有一種富於價値之保障、而不至有根據不充分事實、或未經透澈考量、或其措詞爲欠明確等之危險、且委員會之報告可以如此繕具、而使董事會之注意集中於關於原則各點、而無庸過費其時間、以討論不重要之細節、</p>
<p>一一、在尋常情况之下、委員會之討論、與董事會之討論、有一種重要區别、卽委員會會議不公開、董會會議公開、且會議之經過、在報端發表、但上海方面則無此種區别緣上海因有特殊情况、雖董事會墍各委員會會議之經過、均有短篇之正式報告、由報紙發表、惟其會議則皆不公開、（註六）　（未完）</p>

<p>現見報載此次川戰原因。[因劉湘迷信邪說聽劉崇雲的妖言。崇雲素擅道術。劉湘頗爲相信。尊爲老師。無論軍國大事以及個人行止胥取决於老師。老師嘗謂湘爲川中最大星宿。他日必獨霸一方。日前劉老師齋戒七日七夜。薰沐登塲查考天象。謂已蒙天庭允許委派岳武穆爲總指揮。龐士元爲總參議。祇須經過七七四十九日即可統一四川。]劉湘聽信老師一番胡言亂語。遂造成四川的二劉慘禍。這種野心勃勃的軍閥們聽了這樣天花亂墜的奇談。自然會興高采烈大動干戈。原不足怪。</p>
<p>神道設敎原是我國的老門檻。不過天庭允派岳武穆龐士元兩位神道來做總指揮和總參議。未免有些不高明。岳武穆盡忠報國服從中央應召回都卒爲秦檜所害。未達恢復之志。龐士元佐劉先主取西川。在落鳳坡中箭而亡亦未成大功。他們兩位神道即在生時都没有達到成功的目的。現在天庭派二位神道來做劉湘的總指揮和總參議。恐怕這兩位神道也要說［不參内戰敬謝不敏]罷。</p>
<p>［妖由人興］又曰［國家將亡必有妖孽]。軍閥們不料自己的實力不顧全國的局勢。聽信妖道一意孤行。我想總有些危險罷。滿淸西太后聽信義和團的言扶淸滅洋。槍砲不入結果弄得乘輿播遷。八國聯軍入京效果。毫無上盡大當這是很近的史料。我想劉老師果有本領的話。還是去請封神榜裏諸位神仙。或者去請西遊記裏一觔斗能翻十萬八千里的孫大聖光臨不可。</p>

<p>— 可權</p>
<p>普通各種花的鮮艶，大都是經過不多久的時期，就要凋殘，那不是很可惜的嗎。現在有一種方法，我們把鮮花用人工乾製，能保存那原來的鮮艶可以許久不變。這是一種很好的發明，寫在下面：</p>
<p>我們只要准備一個木箱和一些白沙，便可把花採來，着手乾製。</p>
<p>首先在箱底舗一層白沙，把花放到沙的面上，擺好了姿勢。然後就把花瓣撥開，慢慢兒拿白沙裝滿花朶，再輕輕的撒下白沙，將花的全體淹埋起來，蓋上箱蓋。</p>
<p>這樣做過以後，就把沙箱放到一個乾燥而且溫煖的地方，記好了日期，等到過了兩個星期的光景，把沙箱裏白沙輕輕的揆開看看，假使花瓣上没有了絲毫水分，那就算成功了：如若花瓣還没有十分乾脆；必須再淹埋起來。</p>
<p>我們要知道，普通的鮮花，大約要兩三星期才得製乾，不過還要看氣候冷暖而定，溫度高，花就乾脆得快些，溫度低，花就要乾脆得慢些，這是我們應當留意的。</p>
<p>沙箱裏的花瓣完全乾脆，不是就算成功了麽？那時，我們就慢慢的將沙拿去，！頂好這箱的四圍木板是活的，可以隨意拆去，讓沙自己散開。丨把花取出來。花上如有了沙灰，可用羊毛筆（柔軟的鷄鴨毛也可）輕輕的將牠刷去。這時要特别小心，因爲花瓣乾燥了，是很容易破碎的。</p>
<p>現在拿這製乾的鮮花，插在桌案上的花瓶中，便再也不會凋謝了。</p>
<p>末了，我還要交代淸楚。採取的花朶，須要乾燥整齊，有露水和雨點在上面的，都是不能用啊。花的是否沾染有露水和雨點，這是很容易辨别，祇要注點意，就可以認識的。但是所取來的白沙也要十分乾凈，稍有點不淸潔的雜質在裏面，也都是不能用喲。要使這白沙十分乾凈，就不能不有一種另外手續：這手續就是洗凈。平常的白沙看來雖很潔白，實際上都混雜着有些灰塵，所以要洗凈。我們將取來的白沙放在一白磁盆裏，再拿淸水倒下去，將沙攪動，於是這沙的分量重往下沈，灰塵的分量輕就往上浮，水便變成了混濁。再將這髒水徐徐倒去，換上一些淸水，這樣掉換</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>幾次，直到傾入的淸水，無論怎樣攪動，也不混濁，那白沙纔算淸潔了。然後將水傾去，將沙放在通風的地方晾乾，同時要注意不要讓灰塵落到白沙裏面。這樣洗淨的白沙，就可以放心用了。</p>

<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>民國成立以來，敎育部中央觀象臺，年年編有新書曆，分發各省官廳；可是官廳没有廣爲傳布；所以曉得的人很少。近年來，上海市社會局，也發行一種新曆書，竭力傳布，編法旣好，定價又廉，但是購買的人也不多。而廣東曆本，與小本通書，陳腐蕪陋，社會上倒風行一時。即銷行最廣的國民快覽，内容缺點也很多。我以爲中國曆書的革新，實爲增進國民常職，改造陳腐思想的好機會，那裏可說是小事而忽之呢！現在略舉幾個急應改革的理由如下：</p>
<p>（一）迷信的養成　試翻看社會上所用的廣東曆書，不但印刷惡劣，丨還是木刻，眞是八十年前的印刷品·丨内容最爲荒謬譾陋。除陰曆爲主急宜改革外，悖謬的記載，舉不勝舉，國民耳濡目染，日積月深，思想卑陋，智識幼穉，曆書的不改良，也是一個主因。譬如書裏載着貴神東南，財神正北，喜神西北，宜進人口，入學，上樑，出行，動土，納財，沐浴，立劵······等等，觸目皆是，這不是提倡迷信嗎？天干地支，本是一種代名詞，古人拿來記時的，現在民間遇着婚喪等大事，不是請瞎子術士來推算，便是去請敎擇日的店肆，而擇日巫覡，又乞靈於曆書；所以這數十頁的破爛曆書，實是巫蠱術士欺人的嫏嬛秘笈了！又如春牛圖的無意識，二十八宿竟比附東漢光武時的二十八個名將，做了天空二十八個星宿的神名。又如元旦開門大吉，元旦焚香大吉之類，荒誕無稽，義文奇陋，不是急宜改革的嗎？</p>
<p>（二）其他的謬誤　通書中只記日月食的時刻，潮汐的漲落，没有說明理由，由</p>
<p>也是缺點。它若［腐草爲螢］，［雀入大水爲蛤一之類，雖然關係節氣，［月令裏已經說過，不過學說謬訛，於動物生理上說不過去，委實是科學的障礙，急應删去的。還有神佛的誕辰，大紀特紀，也令人可笑丨我以爲國恥紀念，科學常職，東三省現狀，國貨外貨的調查，地理曆史的常職，書·算·交通等紀載，都應該增入；還有商人的常識，家庭的組織，個人的修養，社交的常職，尤應該編入，以供實用。唉！現在坊間流行的通書，不但增長國民迷信，而且大背國體，豈不是急應改革的嗎？</p>
<p>坊間流行的曆書，我一時也没工夫去斥其謬誤，不過當軸旣經明令禁止，爲什麽各地這種曆本，都依然大賣特賣，眞是一件疑問！二十二年的荒謬曆本，市上又要發行了，不曉得各地當局，有何辦法？</p>

<p>這椿閙鬼的事情,被熊君的朋友,知道了,就寫信報告他,熊君接到了這封信,心中萬分的疑惑,馬上回來,她姊妹們·把這事告訴了他，熊君倒有些不信，他是警界中人，何等地機警，疑惑這件事情總有蹊蹺，於是跑到房中，檢點箱籠，果然不出他的所料，發現缺失二百餘元的東西，斷定是老嫗的槍花。馬上把她扣留起來，</p>
<p>她供出，因她姊妹三人，年幼可欺，故而弄這個裝鬼呌的詭計，嚇她們畏欋了，躱往被中，並要求我睡在一房，於是，我好乘機行事，竊取東西了。</p>
<p>昨天，熊君把這事的經過詳情，函告作者，我看完了原函，非常感慨，深嘆世風澆漓，道德淪亡，奸詐詭謀，人心叵測，若該嫗，年已花甲，尙作此等騙竊的不良行爲可見現在的社會，眞是江河日下了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japan's Diplomatic Reckoning <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>By Han</p>
<p>Japan's recent foreign policy has shifted from passive retreat from the League of Nations to active participation. The envoy sent to Geneva for negotiations is none other than Matsuoka Yosuke, the former Deputy Director-General of Manchuria and Mongolia and a key figure in the Seiyukai party, known as an expert on Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>Matsuoka Yosuke is well-known among the Chinese people; many can vividly recall that during the January 28th Incident, Matsuoka Yosuke secretly came to Shanghai and stayed at the Cathay Hotel with the mission of persuading foreign residents in Shanghai. His arguments were merely footnotes to the Tanaka Memorial, asserting that Japan's Monroe Doctrine in East Asia must be recognized by the great powers, and that China had no right to interfere in the Manchuria-Mongolia issue on Chinese territory. The absurdity of this argument is self-evident. Now, Matsuoka Yosuke has embarked on a journey to Geneva with the same mission.</p>
<p>At a farewell gathering held at the Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo, Matsuoka Yosuke expounded on his mission to the West, his arguments as absurd as before, but even more intensified. The Chinese people cannot help but bristle upon hearing Matsuoka Yosuke's words: "In terms of diplomatic relations, we must settle the old accounts of the past twenty years." And the way to settle these old accounts is purely based on Japan's national policy as the main principle. Since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, the dramas enacted by Japan have been continuous, all being necessary procedures in the reckoning process. As Inahara Katsuji said (see "Our Diplomacy" reprinted from the June issue of the Diplomatic Times), "The process of the Manchurian Incident and the establishment of Manchukuo are for Japan..."</p>
<p>"...the resolution of various outstanding issues in international diplomacy, especially in relation to China." Therefore, Matsuoka Yosuke's theory of settling old accounts is not merely a personal statement by Matsuoka Yosuke, but a unanimous call from the Japanese government and public.</p>
<p>According to Matsuoka Yosuke's speech, his trip to Geneva is indeed to "deal with the Manchuria-Mongolia issue," but the purpose of his mission is to "frankly express the spirit of Japan and the actions of the Japanese people to the people of Europe and America." The "Manchuria-Mongolia issue" has reached its current state as a result of the manifestation of the "Japanese spirit." "Based on the establishment of Manchukuo and Japan's recognition... the issue has come to an end." There is no need for the League of Nations to resolve it any further. Matsuoka Yosuke's mission in attending the League of Nations in the near future is merely to "fully explain the actions taken by Japan since last autumn."</p>
<p>"…all actions and attitudes are fair and legitimate." Matsuoka Yosuke has also provided a brief explanation of the basis for this fairness and legitimacy. Japan "[for the sake of national survival, and in strict adherence to the national policy passed down since the Meiji era, this policy...]"</p>
<p>"...takes the protection of the integrity of the East as its principle." The so-called East now refers to China. China is currently in a state of great chaos. There is only one way to ensure peace in China, and that is to firmly implement Japan's national policy." What is Japan's national policy? It is what Tanaka Giichi said in his memorial: "To conquer the world, we must first conquer China; to conquer China, we must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia." It is foreseeable that in the near future, Matsuoka Yosuke will proclaim Japan's national policy to the world on the shores of Lake Geneva, where the silver of Mont Blanc reflects the clear waters of the lake.</p>
<p>Matsuoka Yosuke's arguments are so absurd that even a child can see through them, and there is no need for us to refute them vehemently. The basis of his arguments can be summed up in one word: sophistry. The recklessness of his arguments is such that even the sophists of old would sigh in admiration. And the central doctrine of the sophists, "might makes right," is not only revered by Japan, but has become the foundation of Japan's national policy and is being diligently put into practice. The purpose of Matsuoka Yosuke's mission is no less than to defend "might makes right." From now on, those in the world who believe in might can tear off their masks of peace, and the charter of the League of Nations must undergo a fundamental revision. All occurrences of the word "justice" should be uniformly changed to "might." All peace treaties such as the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact should be completely abolished. Only in this way can Japan's national policy proceed without hindrance. For Matsuoka Yosuke and the Japanese government he represents, the determination of Japan's national policy is nothing less than seeking to ensure world peace. If China does not perish, Japan will not rest. If Japan does not rest, the world will not be at peace. Therefore, to satisfy Japan's desires and bring peace to the world, the only way is to destroy China.</p>

<p>Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">Central Government Decides to Reassure Han Fuju <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>At the Same Time, He is Requested to Obey Orders and Cease Attacking</p>
<p>Song Ziwen Cables Han Not to Lose Heart, Work Together to Overcome Difficulties</p>
<p>Important Figures in North China Plan to Discuss Mediation Measures</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Lu conflict has lasted nearly a month. After the Central Government proposed a clear telegram solution, Han Fuju suddenly telegraphed the Central Government requesting to resign. The government has decided to reassure him, but Han must confirm his compliance with the designated defense areas in the five counties of Liu Zhennian and cease attacks. Tomorrow, the Executive Yuan will discuss a reply to Han, both urging him not to resign and requesting him to strictly comply with Central Government orders to stop the military's advance and not cross east of Weixian to maintain the overall situation. It is heard that Han Fuju indirectly telegraphed Nanjing, hoping the Central Government would reprimand Liu Zhennian for interfering in civil administration with a military presence, so the provincial chairman could save face, and also requested Liu's troops to cede Yexian as well, in which case Han would agree to immediately withdraw troops back to the province, relieving the Central Government's concerns about the east. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Song Ziwen telegraphed Han, "To Chairman Han Fang, Zhen Mi, upon reading your telegram to the Fu Yuan Ma, I was suddenly saddened to learn of your intention to retire. At a time when foreign troubles are increasing daily and internal worries have not ceased, your responsibility in sitting in the East Lu is particularly heavy. The Central Government relies on you extremely, and will not allow you to retire. Please do not lose heart and work together to overcome difficulties. I hope you will follow my example." (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han's telegram requesting resignation has made the situation in Lu increasingly complex. Jiang has telegraphed Jiang Bocheng, inquiring about the truth of Han's resignation. Zhang Xueliang is very concerned about this and has scheduled to meet with Han's representative Liu Xizhong tonight to inquire about the details of the Lu situation. Important figures in Beiping believe that Han's resignation has a significant impact on the political situation in North China and are discussing a mediation plan. After submitting it to the Central Government for approval, they will proceed with mediation to resolve the situation as soon as possible. This plan can be realized within days. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Xizhong visited Jiang Bocheng last night and briefly explained the rumors circulating outside. A certain party received a telegram from Jinan stating that Han's intention to resign is firm and hopes the Central Government will approve his overseas travel. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju said, upon receiving Zhang Xueliang's telegram, advising me not to be impulsive about my resignation, in fact, I am forced to do this and am not being impulsive. Jiang Bocheng telegraphed that he would consult with the commander-in-chief before handling the matter. Provincial Committee Zhang Yue, Division Commander Gu Liangmin inspected Yantai and will return to Jinan within days. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Upon hearing that Liu's army will still be stationed in the original defense area, the people of Jiaodong fear retaliation for helping the provincial army and are now rising up to deceive Liu and resolve to save themselves. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The compromise plan of the Central Government ordering Liu Zhennian to hand over Yexian and Laiyang, and Han's army to withdraw west of Weixian, has not been implemented and has already been broken. Since the 21st, the war between the two armies has gradually unfolded. Han's army, surrounding Yexian and Laiyang, is intensifying its artillery attacks. Liu's army's defense is becoming more solid. Casualties on both sides are heavy. On Han's army side, more than 150 people, including company commanders and below, have been killed or injured. Liu's army has suffered even greater losses. The final battle between the two armies will intensify. (Telecommunications telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Dai and He Discuss the Sichuan Situation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Plan to Have Elimination Methods</p>
<p>Will Telegraph Jiang for Approval</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Chuanxian visited He Yingqin on the 23rd to discuss the Sichuan situation. A plan to eliminate the conflict has been drafted and will be telegraphed to Jiang for approval. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government advocates first ceasing military action on the Sichuan issue, and then discussing the aftermath. In principle, the Suining Conference and the principles for governing Sichuan can be accepted. After both sides implement a ceasefire, these two points will be incorporated into the solution for the Sichuan issue and opinions will be solicited from all parties. If He Fang is unwilling to accept this proposal, the Central Government will take effective measures and severely punish them. Sending personnel to Sichuan will not become a reality before the war stops. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military figures say that although the central military authorities have repeatedly telegraphed to advise on the Sichuan issue, both sides are still indulging in their own emotions and moving towards extremes. It is difficult to effectively dissuade them. The only option is to let them change naturally, wait for the results of their engagement, when both sides are exhausted and their weaknesses are exposed, then the government will use considerable force to deal with the situation impartially, judge right and wrong, and impose responsibilities. Those who do not comply will be punished by law, which will be easier to accomplish. In short, disregarding the overall situation and fighting within the walls is tantamount to entering a state of collapse and self-destruction. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Liu Wenhui telegraphed a reply to the Executive Committee of the Political Council, saying that in the midst of national crisis, how dare we engage in fratricide? Recently, some people have stirred up trouble and initiated disputes for no reason. However, Hui still obeys the telegraph orders, instructs the troops to firmly defend the original defense and awaits the Central Government's solution. If we can all abide by it, we pray for it.

<h3 id="e4">Volunteer Army Withdraws from Yixian <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The volunteer army that stubbornly defended the city of Yixian has retreated to Qilihezi due to insufficient support and frequent artillery bombardment by the Japanese army. Japanese armored vehicles are guarding the Yixian railway station and reinforcements are still arriving continuously. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Volunteer Army Occupies Zhanggutai Station <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhanggutai Station on the Datong Line has been occupied by the volunteer army, which is advancing towards Zhangwu County. The volunteer army is very active in Tongliao County. The Japanese side is transferring troops from Goubangzi to provide assistance. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Su Bingwen Agrees to Release Japanese Prisoners <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) General Su Bingwen has replied to the Soviet Union's request on October 15th, agreeing to release a portion of the Japanese prisoners of war in Manzhouli and retreat into Russian territory. Yesterday, General Su sent a note to the Soviet Consul in Manzhouli, stating, "The Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Volunteer Army expresses gratitude to the Soviet government for its goodwill in requesting the release of peaceful Japanese civilians to retreat into Russian territory. General Su Bingwen hereby agrees to this request from the Soviet government and decides to release women and children first, according to the list submitted by the Japanese Consulate through the Soviet Consul, and then release men who have no connection with the Japanese army or Manchukuo." It is noted that since Su initiated an uprising on the western end of the Middle East Railway on September 27th and occupied Manzhouli, the Japanese government has requested the Soviet government to contact Su and release the Japanese residents in the area to retreat into Russian territory. The Soviet government, for humanitarian reasons, accepted the request and contacted Su, and a satisfactory result has now been achieved. (TASS telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) After the road protection army on the Middle East Railway revolted on September 27th, they detained Japanese residents along the route. The Japanese Consul in Manzhouli negotiated with the Soviet authorities to discuss with General Su Bingwen and requested permission for Japanese residents to move to Russian territory. According to the reply, the Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Army is grateful for the application granted by the Soviet Russian government, and now intends to approve the peaceful Japanese residents to leave the country in accordance with the list of Japanese consulates submitted by the Soviet Russian Consulate, only intending to give priority to women and children, followed by those who did not participate in the military operations of the National Salvation Army and did not serve in the puppet government.

<p>(Hankou) Xia Douyin's condition has worsened, and he has been admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuchang for treatment. He has also submitted his resignation as provincial chairman to Jiang again. Jiang is still trying to comfort and retain him. According to those close to Xia, Xia's illness has not lessened and requires long-term recuperation. At a time when bandit troubles have just been quelled and everything is waiting to be taken care of, he does not want to neglect his duties due to prolonged illness. He still intends to politely request Jiang to approve his resignation. When his sick body recovers slightly in the future, he will continue to serve the party and the country as a party member, to live up to Jiang's expectations.

<h3 id="e16">British People Kidnapped in Niuzhuang <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Negotiate the Release Process</p>
<p>Niuzhuang The details of the negotiations between the Japanese and bandits in Niuzhuang for the release of the British people have been revealed today. The bandit den had no fixed location, making it difficult to make contact. On October 6th, Uchiumi, a Japanese man from the "Manchukuo" police team, accompanied by four surrendered bandits, went to the bandit den with opium and cigarettes as gifts. The bandit leader treated them with courtesy. After a long discussion, Uchiumi undertook to negotiate with friendship. The bandits refused to hand over the British people but accepted the gifts and stated that the original request was only intimidation. They treated the two British people very well and have now reduced their demands and agreed to move them within fifty miles of Panshan within five days to facilitate negotiations. It is expected that contact can be made with the intermediary again around October 13th. On October 13th, Uchiumi returned to a bandit den closer to Panshan, still carrying opium and with a friendly attitude, requesting the bandits to hand over the British people immediately, as the Gaodian army might use force to recapture the British people. At that time, even if the lives of the two British people were not guaranteed, none of the bandits would be able to escape. At that time, 700 surrendered bandits had been ordered by Japanese officers to advance south and form a protection line north and south of Taian. At the same time, the British and Japanese authorities in Panshan were in close contact. Bandit leader Bai Batian told Uchiumi that he was eager to get rid of the responsibility of detaining the British people but did not believe the story of the Gaodian army's departure. Bai repeatedly reduced the ransom request and set a deadline of five days to reply but detained two of those who accompanied Uchiumi as guarantees. The next day, another Japanese man named Yue went directly to the bandit den from Panshan and met with Bai Batian. They embraced each other and pointed guns at each other, agreeing that if they heard their subordinates open fire, they would all perish together. Before long, the two sides gradually eased their tensions. Yue acted as a mediator, instructing the bandits to send a letter with moderate wording to the British Consul in Panshan, and Yue would handle all matters. If Bai agreed to hand over the British people, the bandits would be exempt from prosecution, and the Gaodian army could also withdraw. Bai Batian accepted the above conditions and stated that if the ransom was prepared as listed, the bandits could move closer to Panshan. The bandits requested 40 rings, officer uniforms, leather coats, leather boots, and hats, and civilian coats, five sets each, as well as five pairs of shoes, in addition to a gold watch and a barber's razor, etc., but did not mention the ransom amount, only stating that they should be given travel expenses at their discretion. Within two days, all the items were prepared. On the 18th, a messenger went to the bandit den to inform them that everything had been prepared and requested them to move closer to Panshan as agreed. On the 19th, a messenger accompanied the bandit representative back to Panshan. The bandit representative came here to guide the actions of the mediator and asked the British and Japanese personnel to go to the bandit den on the 20th but instructed them not to take photos. On the morning of the 20th, the Japanese led 28 guards, led by a Sichuanese, and Uchiumi, Yue, and others also followed, all wearing Chinese clothes, holding Japanese flags, and carrying gifts. They traveled about 25 miles and stopped briefly at Daban Village. The Sichuanese and the guards stayed in the village, and the rest proceeded about five miles to Huangjiapu. It was nearly noon. The two British people had been in Huangjiapu for five days, but on the 19th, they were moved to Sunjiadian and lived in a dirty room without windows. They did not understand the reason and were very worried. At night, the wind and rain were mixed, the dilapidated house was completely wet, and the dangerous wall was about to collapse, which made them even more uneasy. At two o'clock the next day, the bandits ordered them to go out and saw the Japanese flag, and they knew that freedom was restored. At 7:00 pm, when it was already dark, they arrived at Daban Village. They encountered rain along the way, dragging through the mud and water. Mrs. Bowles was extremely tired. After eating some hot food, she boarded an armored train. The 40-day bandit den life came to an end. (Reuters telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Niuzhuang Mrs. Bowles showed slight signs of nervousness today. Yesterday, she was photographed, entertained the press, and answered various questions about her health. She did not rest all day and felt very tired. At 3:00 pm this afternoon, she left for Dalian with her parents, Dr. and Mrs. Philip, and her husband, Bowles, planning to transfer to Japan for recuperation. After her health recovers, Mrs. Bowles will go to Tianjin because her husband is currently working for the Asiatic Petroleum Company in Tianjin. The local church has scheduled a thanksgiving service on October 30th to thank God for protecting Mrs. Bowles and Kirkland and ensuring their safe escape. (Reuters telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Niuzhuang A Reuters special correspondent met with Mrs. Bowles. According to reports, she and Kirkland were not ill-treated by the bandits. One day, she was so furious that she cursed the bandits. A bandit held a stick to strike her, but Kirkland snatched it away and broke it into several pieces. Then the bandits vented their anger on Kirk, tying his hands for about ten minutes before releasing him. From then on, the bandits treated them with courtesy. The correspondent asked if she knew Uchiumi of the "Manchukuo" police team. Mrs. Bowles replied that she did. He was the first to arrive, around the 8th or 9th of this month. He spoke very gently, telling us not to be afraid and saying that he would come again on the 13th. He did arrive on that day. The other visitors were all disgusting, saying that we should write down everything we had experienced and give it to them. Mrs. Bowles also recounted her kidnapping experience, saying that we were thinly clothed and felt very cold at night, so we asked for a dirty cotton quilt from the bandits and slept with our heads covered. The bandits gambled in our small room all night, preventing you from closing your eyes. In order to please us, the bandits brought some Chinese pastries, and we ate them all. After that, they did not gamble in our room. The bandits loved empty foreign tin cans very much and used them to hold opium. Mrs. Bowles continued to ask the Reuters correspondent if there had been any fighting in Dashiqiao a few days after they were kidnapped, because many people rushed to the bandit den that day, shouting that 300 Japanese people had been killed and the entire city of Dashiqiao had been burned to the ground. Mrs. Bowles continued, "Of course, they are all liars." She also said that when the kidnapping occurred, Bai Batian's younger brother was still lying injured in the hospital. His servant had a mole under his left eye. After Bai Batian's younger brother returned to the bandit den, his wound reopened, and we used medicine to wash and treat it. The correspondent asked if there were any other kidnapped people in their small room. Mrs. Bowles replied, "No, they were all tied up in another room." Mrs. Bowles continued to praise the loyalty of her groom, saying that when he left the bandit den, he cried and could not bear to leave first. The correspondent also asked who she wanted to see when she arrived in Niuzhuang. Mrs. Bowles replied that she did not want to see anyone except her husband and her parents, and to take a bath, change clothes, and get a comfortable bed. (Reuters telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>A telegram from Taipei to the Far East News Agency on the 23rd states that recently, the aborigines in the mountains of Taiwan are on the verge of rebellion.

Currently, the Japanese authorities in Taiwan are actively planning a suppression and intend to appoint the chief of the local police station as the commander of the suppression force, leading over 240 soldiers into the aborigines' territory on the 26th of this month to carry out the suppression.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Japanese Diplomacy Becomes Active <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Implementing the Asian Monroe Doctrine</p>
<p>Seeking International Coordination on China</p>
<p>A telegram from Tokyo to the Dempo News Agency on the 23rd states that Foreign Minister Uchida said in the last Diet session that the Far Eastern issue can only be resolved through the friendship of China, Japan, and Manchuria, expressing the foundation of the so-called Far Eastern Monroe Doctrine. It is not limited to Far Eastern policy, and it is recognized that it is necessary to change the traditional approach to European and American policy. Therefore, he ordered Ambassador Izubuchi to the United States, Ambassador Hirota to Russia, Ambassador Obata to Germany, and other major ambassadors on the front line of diplomacy to return home to be given the fundamental direction of Uchida's diplomacy. At the same time, he specially sent Matsuoka to the League of Nations as a representative, and appointed Ambassador Arima to China. In this way, the lineup of Uchida's diplomacy has been gradually completed, and its full picture will be displayed to the world with the League of Nations General Assembly and Council as the center. The fundamental direction of Uchida's diplomacy is roughly as follows: (1) Continue to proceed with the spirit of international coordination without change, reject passivism, and strive for active explanation to dispel the suspicions and misunderstandings of other countries, but may withdraw from the League of Nations if confronted with unreasonable attitudes. (2) Aim to establish the principle of "Far Eastern affairs should be managed by the Far East itself" and cultivate this belief in other countries. (3) Assist the development of Manchukuo and promote the opportunity for other countries to recognize [Manchukuo]. (4) Expect China to establish a strong central government, and therefore will not hesitate to provide international assistance to related countries.</p>

<p>A telegram from Tokyo to the Far East News Agency on the 23rd states that, according to a telegram from the Tencho Maru received in Tokyo, the delegation led by Matsuoka Yosuke, the Japanese representative to the League of Nations, set sail from Tsuruga Port on that ship at 2:00 PM yesterday. Immediately upon reaching the sea, it encountered a large storm, with high waves making navigation very difficult. Matsuoka and his party were mentally exhausted and pale. Representative Matsuoka expressed his feelings about this great storm, saying that this trip is to fight for Japanese diplomacy, and it happens to coincide with this fierce storm and waves, which seems to be a sign of the many difficulties in the future of Japanese diplomacy. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the success or failure of this final diplomatic debate in Geneva with various countries.</p>

<p>A telegram from Tokyo to the Far East News Agency on the 23rd states that the Bugei-kai, Kinno-ishin Domei, Seisan-to, and Shin Nippon Kokumin Domei of Japanese nationalist groups have traditionally lacked control, so they do not communicate with each other. Although they have the same ideology in name, their forms are divided and cannot unite. Recently, stimulated by the Japanese political situation, they feel that a great unity is essential, so they are actively planning to unite the above groups with the National Socialist Party as the center. Akamatsu, the main leader of the Socialist Party, has been running around in various directions these days and is very busy, seeking to achieve the goal of unity as soon as possible.</p>

The reason is that Ambassador Izubuchi does not have much rapport with the US State Department in his diplomatic exchanges. If Izubuchi is sent to the United States again, it is feared that there will be no hope of restoring relations between Japan and the United States. Therefore, Japanese residents in various parts of the United States plan to telegraph their opposition to the Japanese government, saying that if it is necessary for Ambassador Izubuchi to return to office, he should wait until the Manchurian issue has been resolved to a considerable extent before sending him back.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Hoover Campaign Speech Surrounded by Communists <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Veterans Join Demonstration Holding Flags</p>
<p>Chanting Slogans to Overthrow President Hoover</p>
<p>National Press Agency, Detroit, 22nd Dispatch: When US President Hoover arrived here today to give a speech, his special train was met by over two thousand young communists staging a demonstration. Hoover was trapped in the train for twenty-five minutes before he could leave the station and proceed to the Olympic Stadium clubhouse. The sound of the train whistle and the clatter of the wheels were drowned out by the shouts of the demonstrators. Communist youths, both male and female, mingled with veterans, crowded around the station, repeatedly attempting*</p>
<p>to rush into the station. Only when a large contingent of police arrived did they manage*</p>
<p>to persuade the demonstrators to the roadside, leaving a corridor in the middle for the President's*</p>
<p>car to pass. The demonstrators held large flags with white backgrounds and red characters, reading*</p>
<p>["Down with Hoover, he has caused fifteen million people to lose their jobs,"]*</p>
<p>Another large flag read, ["Down with Hoover, he burdens the people with huge debts."]*</p>
<p>As Hoover and his party drove past in their cars, the crowd became even more*</p>
<p>intoxicated and frenzied. Those standing on the side of the road shouted slogans such as ["He gives millions to the banks, but not a penny to you!"] Furthermore, one person wearing a tattered old army hat climbed to a high place and shouted wildly, ["Down with Hoover, the butcher of veterans!"] Not far from the station, countless leaflets were thrown at the cars, all containing abusive language towards Mr. Hoover. The end of the text claimed, ["We faced cannons in 1917 and 1918, so we can certainly face machine guns in 1932."] In addition, there were demands for bonus payments and loans in cash, all made by veterans. From the station to the meeting place at the Olympic Stadium, a distance of four miles, the sides of the road were lined with people. As the President's car passed, they were either silently speechless or uttered complaints, with no one offering praise. The President tried to force a smile in the car, but ultimately could not hide his feelings. The First Lady, sitting beside him, had her brows deeply furrowed and remained silent. It is said that, apart from when Woodrow Wilson toured the country in 1919 to explain the League of Nations plan and received silent receptions in some towns, no other major figure has ever suffered such an unpleasant reception. However, after the four-mile long journey came to an end, as soon as the President arrived at the entrance of the Olympic Stadium, thunderous cheers erupted, deafening the ears. He was immediately led by party leaders to the podium, where he delivered a carefully prepared and exceptionally astute speech. The twenty-two thousand men and women in the audience applauded constantly, their cheers resounding outside, a stark contrast to the cold reception along the way.</p>
<p>National Press Agency, Detroit, 22nd Dispatch: US President Hoover, in his speech at the Olympic Stadium here tonight, vehemently refuted the attacks of his political opponents and vigorously defended the government's policies. His speech was exceptionally astute, deeply moving all who listened. The speech was almost entirely focused on domestic issues, but also touched on the issue of disarmament, stating the government's recent policy, saying that the United States urgently wants to reduce armaments to alleviate the tax burden. The people and the government have already proposed principles hoping to achieve large-scale disarmament. The second step now must await the response of other countries. In these turbulent times, without an international general agreement on disarmament, the United States must not further reduce its defensive capabilities, and so on. Hoover, who had never directly criticized Democratic presidential candidate Roosevelt, this time broke the ice and directly attacked Mr. Roosevelt, demonstrating that the electoral competition between the two sides has reached the point of close combat. Automotive magnate Henry Ford was the first to welcome Hoover upon his arrival, and then sat next to the podium during the speech. After the President finished speaking, he personally escorted him to his special train and bid him farewell.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 22nd Dispatch: President Hoover, in a speech to the people in Charleston, West Virginia today, stated that he has instructed the Senate Finance Committee to thoroughly study the tariff issue, in order to understand whether American goods have appropriate protection after the devaluation of various countries' currencies. He also said, ["The current situation in the United States is improving, and I am fortunate to be able to tell you this."] The Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee also confirmed the President's statement regarding the study.</p>
<p>Reuters, St. Louis, 22nd Dispatch: Democratic presidential candidate Roosevelt, speaking here today, refuted President Hoover's claim that the American economic depression was caused by foreign influence, saying that the Wall Street crash of 1929 was the true starting point of the economic depression, and that the high tariffs proposed by the Republican Party exacerbated the situation, spreading it throughout the world.</p>

<h3 id="e74">London to Convene Third Round Table Conference <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Indian Princes Invited to Participate</p>
<p>Nationalist Party Representatives Excluded</p>
<p>Havas, London, 22nd Dispatch: Regarding the Indian question, another Round Table Conference will soon be held in London. The India Office has recently announced the list of Indian representatives for the conference. There are thirteen princely states within India, all represented by their respective Prime Ministers, with each state allowed only one representative. Among the representatives from the provinces, the most important are Aga Khan, representing several Muslim communities, and Ambedkar, a representative of the Untouchable caste. The number of representatives at this conference is no more than forty, a far cry from the ninety-six at the first conference and the one hundred and eight at the second. The India Office explains this by saying that "the Indian matter has reached the stage where committees are responsible for the work. All work must be made effective and actively promoted." Another noteworthy point is that there are no representatives from the Indian National Congress at the Round Table Conference. The reason is likely that the National Congress is promoting a non-violent resistance movement, and therefore was not invited to participate.</p>
<p>National Press Agency, London, 22nd Dispatch: The Indian Round Table Conference is expected to convene on November 15 in the House of Lords. This conference will be smaller in scope than the previous two, to facilitate the progress of work. The most important issues are the safeguards concerning finance, defense, and foreign affairs. Therefore, these three major powers will not be under the jurisdiction of the Federal Legislative Assembly in the future, but will remain in the hands of the Governor-General representing the British Crown. In addition, the future relationship between the Federal Legislative Assembly and the executive branch, as well as between the provinces, will also be a major issue considered at the conference, such as what falls under the jurisdiction of the Federal Legislative Assembly and what falls under the jurisdiction of the local legislative assemblies. Unresolved matters in the ethnic electoral system are not within the scope of the conference.</p>
<h3 id="e75">New Belgian Cabinet Formed <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Merely a Transitional Nature</p>
<p>Hymans Remains as Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Havas, Brussels, 22nd Dispatch: A new cabinet has recently been formed, with Broqueville (Catholic Party) as Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, Hymans (Liberal Party) remaining as Foreign Minister, Bourgeois (Christian Democratic Party) as Minister of the Interior, Jaspar (Catholic Party) as Minister of Finance, Janson (Liberal Party) as Minister of Justice, and Denis (Catholic Party) as Minister of National Defense. All cabinet members have previously served in the cabinet, and Broqueville, Bourgeois, Jaspar, and Denis have all served as Prime Minister. Tonight, all newspapers praise the leaders of the new government. Le Soir of Belgium stated that Prime Minister Broqueville presided over political affairs for several years before and after the outbreak of the European War, with arduous and outstanding achievements, greatly benefiting the country. The newspaper then raised the question, ["Prime Minister Broqueville has formed a cabinet, but can it actually govern?"]. This statement represents the general impression. Broqueville recently issued a statement, and from the wording, it can be inferred that the new cabinet is merely transitional. The National Assembly will be dissolved imminently. The wording of the dissolution order will be agreed upon by the cabinet on Monday, and then signed by the King and immediately promulgated.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Roman Cabinet Reorganized to Vigorously Reform Domestic Affairs <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Havas, Rome, 22nd Dispatch: At the beginning of his tenure, the new Prime Minister, Mussolini, vigorously reformed domestic affairs. He explained two of the plans he proposed to the press: (1) Decentralization of administrative organization; (2) A law passed by the National Assembly in 1926, stating that any party that obtains more than 40% of the total votes in an election will occupy 50% of the total seats in parliament, and the remaining seats will be distributed according to the proportion of votes obtained by other parties. Prime Minister Mussolini intends to abolish this method and will soon draft a bill to submit to the National Assembly. Public opinion generally supports the Prime Minister's intention. As for foreign policy, Prime Minister Mussolini adopts a flexible approach. Regarding the issue of concluding a non-aggression treaty with Russia, Mr. Mussolini and Foreign Minister Titulescu hold the same view, that the Romanian position created by the Kellogg-Briand Pact should not suffer any damage. Regarding the non-aggression matter, the negotiations conducted by the previous Vida Cabinet seem to be about to resume soon. The Romanian Ambassador to Poland, Gafencu, has met with Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov several times in recent weeks and will soon come to Beijing to receive new instructions.</p>

The National Socialist Party has included Litzmann in the party's list of recommendations, because they do not want Mrs. Zetkin of the Communist Party to be the temporary chairman again due to her seniority.</p>

<p>Havas, Rome, 22nd Dispatch: The third meeting of the Balkan National Assembly was opened by the new Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, who delivered the opening speech, the main points of which are as follows: ["Mutual trust and understanding between countries, and faith in the future, are the foundations of world peace. It is wrong to say that the absence of war is peace. Peace must be achieved through struggle, not merely through declarations. To consolidate peace, one must endure hardship and persevere. The difficulty of this endeavor is no less than any other great undertaking."]. Titulescu also said that the purpose of this meeting is to work towards the unity of the Balkan nations within the scope of the League of Nations.</p>

<p>Havas, Turin, 23rd Dispatch: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered an important speech here this morning, listing the domestic and foreign policies of Fascism. When mentioning the Disarmament Conference, Mussolini declared, "We have put forward practical and concrete suggestions, but some people have falsely accused us of being deceitful, which is the height of hypocrisy." He also said, "The policy advocated by Italy is a peaceful policy, but some people disapprove of Italy's continued existence, especially because the principles we represent are contrary to the principles they represent, and therefore they cannot be forgiven. But their principles are long outdated, and they have become a theoretical war with what we advocate. The result of this war has long been determined, and victory belongs to us." Mr. Mussolini also said, "Turin is a border city and has no fear of war." He then spoke about the League of Nations, saying, "The wishes expressed by the Fascist Party Congress have aroused the interest of the whole world. Some people ask whether Italy is still a member of the League of Nations. I now declare that the League of Nations is currently suffering from a serious illness, and we cannot abandon it. We will never abandon a patient on the sickbed. Other countries should also continue to cooperate with the League of Nations. The League of Nations is now too globalized. The more members that join the League of Nations, the more inefficient the League of Nations will become. The League of Nations can achieve results in European affairs, but in terms of the Far East and the Americas, the words of the League of Nations are merely empty words." Mr. Mussolini then said that the cooperation of the four major Western European powers is sufficient to bring peace to Europe and eliminate the economic crisis, but to achieve this goal, "Italy's sacred rights" must first be recognized. Mussolini predicted that the Disarmament Conference would fail, and then declared the Fascist Party's view of foreign policy, "We do not want any hegemony in Europe, especially if this hegemony allows the powerful to maintain their unjust position." He then mentioned the war debt issue, saying, "This debt should have been written off. We said this a year ago, but it is still unknown whether the United States will disregard its conclusions after the Lausanne Conference." Finally, Mussolini boasted about the achievements of the Fascist system in domestic affairs and concluded, "In the coming years, our new slogan will be to move forward, build, and fight when necessary."</p>

<p>National Press Agency, Berlin, 22nd Dispatch: Germany recently celebrated the 70th birthday of Mr. Solf, the former ambassador to Japan. Japanese expatriates in Berlin all participated, causing a very strong pro-Japanese atmosphere to suddenly emerge in Germany. Today, the Tingteko Museum in Berlin held a private exhibition of Mr. Solf's collection, displaying all the antiques, calligraphy, and paintings collected by Mr. Solf in Japan over the years. The most important collection is five hundred kinds of Japanese history since the eighteenth century. It is said that this kind of collection is rarely matched even in Japan itself.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Future Record of Japan-US Naval Battle <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>(Continued 4)</p>
<p>The above naval ratio table shows that Britain is 5, the United States is 5.69, and Japan is 7.01. Therefore, Japan's submarine force is far superior to that of Britain and the United States, especially when accompanying the main fleet. Japan's holding volume is even more superior. The ratio of the number of ships, Japan's 8.4, is appropriate to the sum of the UK and the US, and the tonnage ratio, Japan's 7.67, is also equivalent to the sum of the UK and the US of 8.75. In total, Japan's 8.25 is equivalent to the UK and the US's 8.6. Therefore, Japan and the UK and US are mutually comparable in actual strength. However, the UK and the US were originally advanced countries in shipbuilding technology. Why is the naval strength of these two countries less than that of Japan? This is because after the European War, Japan gained more advantages from Germany than the UK and the US. As mentioned above, although the number of US submarines is more than that of Japan, the commander of the US Navy revealed that there were more shortcomings, saying, (Their design is obsolete and faulty) and (There is not the least doubt that the Submarine branch of the Japanese Navy is efficient highly trained, and form double,) which is enough to prove it. From this point of view, the capability of the main combat equipment in the naval battle is no longer a concern for Japan.</p>
<p>(B) Air Force Problem: The most terrifying thing about the future Pacific War is the air force. Once the war starts, it may not rely on the navy but use the air force to attack various parts of Japan. However, if US aircraft want to attack the Japanese mainland, they must have land-based air bases, and the US air bases, such as Sand Point and Los Feliz, may not be easy to fly close to Japan. Even if its aircraft technology is developed and the aircraft are numerous, it may not be able to cross the 4,000 nautical miles of the Pacific Ocean. Assuming that it is from Hawaii to Japan, it also reaches a long distance of 3,400 nautical miles. How can it directly threaten (Japan)? The air force strength of the major powers is compared as follows:</p>
<p>UK: The UK has about 1,800 military aircraft and about 900 civil aircraft. The country planned to expand its air force in 1930 and intends to increase its independent squadrons for national defense to 52 squadrons.</p>
<p>US: The United States has two rigid airships, about 1,000 naval aircraft, and 600 army aircraft. It is currently seeking a second expansion plan, with plans to add another 1,000 naval aircraft and 1,800 army aircraft, but the navy's budget has not yet been established.</p>
<p>Russia: Russia has two airships and 1,600 aircraft. It plans to form 220 squadrons by the end of 1933, increasing to 2,200 aircraft. About 500 of them are used in the Far East.</p>
<p>Italy: Italy currently has 1,900 aircraft and 500 civil aircraft.</p>
<p>Japan: The army has 580 standing aircraft, and recently prepared about 300 aircraft. The army authorities plan to organize the land troops into 17 teams by next year, increasing 136 aircraft and ○○ shipborne aircraft (translator's note: according to the Japanese newspaper last year, when the Japanese army occupied the Northeast airfield after the September 18 Incident, the Japanese robbed 173 aircraft. Most of these aircraft are the latest German and American models).</p>
<p>From the above, the air force strength is weaker than that of other countries, but there are no restrictions on the expansion of the air force during the Disarmament Conference. It is not yet possible to limit the extent to which the air forces of various countries will expand in the future. If war breaks out between Japan and the United States, in addition to destroying the joint fleet of the United Kingdom and the United States, the army will have to change its offensive and defensive strategy and turn to offensive operations, that is, using the air force and submarines to cooperate. On the one hand, it will begin to search for the enemy, and on the other hand, it will pass through the Aleutian Islands and Alaska from the Kamchatka Sea to Canada and the American continent. Once it reaches Alaska, (Japan)'s air force will have a landing airfield. At the same time, (Japan) must also defend against the enemy's air attacks. Currently, the country expects that aircraft will attack in four directions during the war:</p>
<p>East: The US fleet coming across the Pacific Ocean will use the weather to approach the enemy aircraft carrier and warships carrying aircraft in the Sea of Japan to bomb (Japan)'s territory, or launch aerial attacks when fighting the main fleet.</p>
<p>West: Flying from mainland China to attack (Japan). Because there are countless airfields in mainland China, once the war starts, the Japanese army will attack China in one direction and seek to occupy Hong Kong, the Philippines, and other places in the other direction. At this time, China will inevitably join the war. With the assistance of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries, China will also inevitably send aircraft to cross the sea and attack.</p>
<p>South: This is to combine the east and west sides to cut off the traffic between Japan and Taiwan. From the bases in the Philippines, Manila, Singapore, etc., they will attack northward.</p>
<p>North: If Soviet Russia strictly maintains neutrality, there is no need to worry. Otherwise, we will be in a very difficult situation.</p>
<p>At present, in order to defend against air attacks, the air defense authorities are trying to find a proper method. In the future, when the war starts, in order to prevent problems before they occur, we should first seek to destroy the enemy's bases. For example, for the enemy aircraft at sea, we should try our best to destroy their aircraft carriers and warships carrying aircraft. On the mainland of China, once the war breaks out, we should occupy its territory in advance, and at the same time, we should bomb the enemy's various facilities from the air, and order the expeditionary army to seize the enemy's air bases. As for Manchuria, it is not easy to launch aerial attacks on (Japan)'s facilities in Manchuria due to the terrain and distance.</p>
<p>In summary, what will be the outcome of the great Pacific naval battle between Japan and the UK and the US? In a word, it all depends on whether our army can destroy the joint fleet of the UK and the US. The comparison of the strengths of our fleet is similar. If Japan's operations are skillful and can defeat the main battleships and cruisers of the UK and the US, then the decisive battle in the Western Pacific can determine the fate of victory or defeat. In the battlefield of the South Pacific, if we can separate the enemy's combined fleet and attack it with surprise attack forces, we can expect victory. However, (Japan)'s main force will be divided into various places, which will inevitably disperse its strength. If it cannot be gathered in a timely and appropriate place, (Japan) will be in an unimaginable situation.

<h3 id="e84">Fierce Battles Between Government Troops and Bandits in Northern Hubei <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>He, Jia, and Wang Flee North; Xu's Bandits Encircled</p>
<p>Xu Yuanquan Goes to Zhongxiang to Personally Supervise the Suppression</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Fourth Army of the Red Bandits, formerly led by the puppet army commander Xu Xiangqian, fled to Suixian County in northern Hubei, attempting to join forces with He's bandits. In the battles of Changgangling and Caodian, they were severely attacked by the Independent 34th Brigade under Luo Qijiang and the 10th Division under Li Mo'an, suffering heavy losses. At the same time, He, Jia, and other bandits were also attacked between Jingmen and Zhongxiang. Although both sides tried hard to join forces, they ultimately found it difficult to achieve their goal due to the excessive pressure from the Nationalist army. It is now reported that Xu's bandits are entrenched in Maochifan. After being pursued by our army, they fled west to Shuanghe, which is the main route from Suixian County to Zhongxiang. Xu's bandits fled this way, presumably still wanting to contact He's bandits to increase their strength. After receiving the report, Garrison Commander Li Huang personally led his troops in close pursuit. On the evening of the 20th, they engaged the main force of the bandits in a fierce battle in the area east of Wujiaji. The two divisions under Li Mo'an and Jiang Fusheng, belonging to Garrison Commander Li, are elite troops of the Nationalist army. Important bandit nests such as Xiji and Jinjiazhai have all been captured by them. Xu's bandits fear them like tigers. Now, with the situation becoming critical, they are encouraging the bandits to fight to the death. From the evening of the 20th to the late night of the 21st, they are still engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat. However, although the bandits are fierce, they are ultimately exhausted and have no way to replenish their weapons and ammunition. During one day and night, they suffered thousands of casualties, and their corpses were scattered everywhere. They were finally surrounded by Garrison Commander Li's troops. Other units have also joined in the joint suppression. In the shortest possible time, they should be completely eliminated. The groups under He Long, Jia Dechang, and Wang Bingnan are distributed in the areas of Yuanjiatai, Baiguoshu, Qushandian, and Liudian. They are being pursued by the 44th Division under Xiao Zhichu, with the two brigades of Yu Zhaolong and Wang Jinyong. The bandits collapse and flee into the mountains as soon as they encounter battle. According to captured bandits, the three bandit leaders, He, Jia, and Wang, were urgently pursued by the Nationalist army and each personally led a pistol team of over a hundred men to flee north. The remaining bandits are leaderless, making it easier to clear them out. It is reported that the Nationalist army is fighting with extraordinary courage. He Chengjun, in order to unify command, departed for Yuekou on the 18th to organize an administrative office. If necessary, he will go to the front to supervise the suppression. Xu Yuanquan left Yuekou for Zhongxiang on the 22nd to inspect the area and may personally go to the front line to supervise the troops, so that the remaining bandits in that area can be resolved as soon as possible. As for the bandits in eastern Hubei, there are still five or six thousand men, led by Cai Shenxi, the puppet commander of the 25th Army. They originally fled to eastern Hubei with Xu Xiangqian's group. After Xu's bandits transferred, Cai still remained in that area. This group suffered setbacks at Da Xiao Wenchong and fled to Qichun, Yingshan, and between Susong and Taihu in Anhui Province. Shangguan Yunxiang is personally supervising the suppression on the front lines. Hao Mengling and Gan Fang are leading a brigade of the 54th Division to flank them through Jinjiapu and Yangliuwan from Yingshan. It is reported that they have already completed the encirclement on the 21st. The 47th Division telegraphed from the front yesterday, reporting the details of the previous battles in great detail. Here is a record as follows: [On the 2nd of this month, the 139th Brigade and the 282nd Regiment of the 141st Brigade turned from near Jinjiapu towards Yangshuwan and Leijiadian to intercept the Red bandits fleeing east. That night and on the afternoon of the 3rd, they fought fiercely with over 10,000 bandits from the 75th Division, the Independent 5th Division, the guerrillas from Liu'an, Huoshan, and Yingshan, and the Independent Regiment, capturing over 100 guns and over 2,000 bandits. On the 4th, the 139th Brigade and the 282nd Regiment followed the bandits to Taojiahe in Taihu County. The bandits split into two groups, fleeing north and south. The 277th and 282nd Regiments pursued the bandits fleeing north, while the 278th Regiment turned south to pursue. The bandits fleeing north were pursued and scattered by the Li and Liu Regiments, capturing over 800 bandits and seizing dozens of guns. The bandits fleeing south were pursued for a day and night to Mataling and Jiangjiahe. On the morning of the 5th, they fought fiercely with 7,000 bandits with over 2,000 guns for 5 hours, capturing over 20 guns and over 200 bandits. The remaining bandits fled to Zhaojiapu in Taihu County. The regiment continued to pursue them and engaged them in a fierce battle at Zhaojiapu for 2 hours on the morning of the 6th. Kong Fanxiang, the commander of the 10th Company, led his entire company into the bandit ranks, seizing over 20 guns and capturing over 100 men. Company Commander Kong and Platoon Leader Li were seriously wounded, and over a dozen soldiers were wounded or killed. The bandits then fled towards Mitusi in Yingshan County. The 277th Regiment and the 282nd Regiment also arrived at Zhaojiapu through Matanhe and Dianqianhe in Taihu County at 3 p.m. on the 6th and sent teams to search for scattered bandits in Bailidun, also seizing over 10 guns. The group of bandits fleeing east was unable to withstand the relentless pursuit for several days and nights. Pei Changhui, the deputy division commander, led the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 282nd Regiment back to Yingshan on the morning of the 7th to assist the local authorities in carrying out rural pacification. Brigade Commander Du led the entire brigade and the 3rd Battalion of the 282nd Regiment, responsible for pursuing and suppressing the bandits, arrived at Mitusi on the afternoon of the 7th. On the morning of the 8th, they followed the bandits to Zhangjiabang in Qichun County. The bandits then fled east to Susong. Brigade Commander Du led Regiment Commander Zhang to temporarily clear out the scattered bandits in Zhangjiabang. Regiment Commander Li led the entire regiment and the 3rd Battalion of the 282nd Regiment followed them and arrived at Changheka on the evening of the 8th, engaging the bandits in a fierce battle for 4 hours. On the afternoon of the 9th, they engaged the bandits in a fierce battle at Erlanghe Town for 3 hours, capturing over 100 guns and over 200 bandits. The bandits then fled northwest. The regiment pursued them to Zijinchong and Zijinshan and made contact on the afternoon of the 10th. Because the bandits had passed through the bandit areas of Mitusi and Zhangjiabang and gathered another 7,000 or 8,000 men with over 2,000 guns, the bandit forces became fierce again. Regiment Commander Li launched a fierce hand-to-hand combat against the bandits, and the bandits also held their ground and defended to the death. After 3 days and nights of fierce fighting, over 1,000 bandits were killed and over 20 guns were seized. We also suffered over 20 soldiers killed or wounded. On the 13th, Brigade Commander Du received a report from Regiment Commander Li and sent Regiment Commander Zhang through Shangxiaheng to Jiangjiashan to attack the bandits' flanks. On the 14th, the bandits were attacked from both sides and fled towards the Zijin River and Heshuijian. However, after our successive interceptions, the bandit forces were scattered. The brigade is still pursuing them in different directions towards Taihu. ] (October 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Zheng Jicheng Case Has Been Judged (Continued) <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>This court investigated the body of the deceased Zhang Zongchang. Face up, connected to the left zygomatic bone, the lower outer corner of the left eye has a handgun bullet entry wound, approximately 6 fen in length and 3 fen in width. It penetrates from the combined face to the right, with an exit wound approximately 3 fen in length and width. The left cheek has one handgun bullet entry wound, approximately 3 fen in length and 2.8 fen in width. It penetrates from the left neck, with an exit wound approximately 3 fen in length and width. Below the exit wound, there is another handgun bullet entry wound, approximately 3 fen in length and 2.8 fen in width. It penetrates from the combined face to the right shoulder near the spine, with an exit wound approximately 3 fen in length and width. Behind the head, near the top of the head facing up, there is one abrasion, obliquely approximately 4.5 fen in length and 2.8 fen in width, with broken skin and bleeding. The right arm has one abrasion, obliquely approximately 1 cun 8 fen in length and 3 fen in width, with broken skin and bleeding. It is determined to be death by gunshot. The body of Liu Huaizhou, face up, has one purplish-black mark on the left rib, approximately 9 fen in length and width, with high swelling around it, red skin inside, obliquely round 5 fen, firm to the touch. The epidermis was cut open with a knife, and one bullet was extracted. The right posterior rib near the spine has one handgun bullet entry wound, approximately 6 fen in length and 3 fen in width. The bullet did not penetrate. (The bullet extracted from the left rib facing up is the one that did not penetrate.) The outer side of the right knee has one abrasion, obliquely round 2 fen, with the skin removed, red. The right arm near the right wrist has one abrasion, approximately 1 cun 2 fen in length and 4.5 fen in width, with the skin removed, red. It is determined to be death by injury. Liu Qingxun, face up, has one handgun entry wound on the right arm, approximately 3 fen in length and width, penetrating from the combined face to the right arm, with an exit wound approximately 3 fen in length and width. Face up, the upper inner side of the left knee has one handgun bullet entry wound, approximately 6 fen in length and 3 fen in width, penetrating from the lower outer side of the left knee, with an exit wound approximately 3 fen in length and width. Only the skin and flesh were injured, not life-threatening. It has been examined and verified by the Chief Prosecutor of this court, and the examination report and injury report are on file. The defendant Zheng Jicheng repeatedly confessed without denial as to how he intended to take revenge, how he and the fugitive Chen Fengshan carried handguns to the Jinpu Railway Station, and how he killed Zhang Zongchang. This corresponds with the facts and is sufficient to serve as the basis for conviction. According to his confession: [On September 3rd, I went to the Charity Association and did not carry a gun. At 3 p.m., I returned home from the Charity Association. I heard people on the street saying that Zhang Zongchang had harmed Shandong in this way, and now he has come and should die here. He is leaving today, which is too easy for him. I was a little moved when I heard this. After returning home, I called for dinner after 5 p.m. I first drank a cup of medicinal wine. I thought that others still felt this way about Zhang Zongchang, and I had a feud with Zhang Zongchang for killing my father and was a revolutionary. How could I let him go? So I decided to kill him. I didn't even eat and called Shigunguan to ask if Zhang Zongchang had left. Because no one answered the phone, I thought he had gone to the station. So I took my handgun and bullets with me. Chen Fengshan also had a handgun and bullets with him. We took a car and first drove around to the entrance of Shigunguan on Weiyi Road. I saw the gate was covered and there were no cars in front. I guessed that he had undoubtedly gone to the station. Then we rushed to the Jinpu Railway Station. Before entering the station, I told Chen Fengshan that I was going to avenge my father and assassinate Zhang Zongchang. He followed me across the overpass to the second platform. He was protecting me. There were more than a dozen people seeing him off under the train. We mingled among the people seeing him off, all saying that the director was a lucky star. Zhang Zongchang saw his guests to the door of the train. I raised my gun and fired a shot at Zhang Zongchang, but it didn't fire. He said it was bad and turned around and ran into the train. I immediately chased after him and fired another shot, but it still didn't fire. I reloaded the bullet. Zhang Zongchang had already run to the east end of the train and was about to jump down when I fired another shot, but it still didn't fire. I chased him down to the second platform. Zhang Zongchang was about to go down to the third platform when I fired another shot. Zhang Zongchang was shot down. I rushed over and fired two more shots, and he died.] The defendant had already deeply considered the matter of killing someone and clearly had premeditation. Although he firmly denies that he personally shot and killed Liu Huaizhou and Liu Qingxun, according to his confession: [He (referring to Zhang Zongchang) had been a director, so I expected him to have guards. Since I was avenging my father and eliminating a scourge for Shandong, I was going to do it at the cost of my life.] This shows that the defendant had an indeterminate intention regarding the people accompanying him who were affected by the assassination of Zhang Zongchang. Furthermore, before entering the station, he informed Chen Fengshan of his plan to assassinate Zhang Zongchang, ordering him to bring a gun with him. The actions of killing Zhang Zongchang, Liu Huaizhou, and Liu Qingxun were indeed carried out jointly by Chen Fengshan and the defendant. In addition, Xia Tingfang, who witnessed the incident at the scene, testified: [Liu Huaizhou was injured first, and then Liu Qingxun and Zhang Zongchang were also injured. I saw two people (referring to the murderers), one wearing a gray long gown, and I didn't pay attention to the other one.] Patrol Captain Bi Shizhen testified: [I saw Chen Fengshan aiming the gun at Zhang Zongchang. Chen Fengshan said that he was avenging his military commander.] This is sufficient to prove that they were joint principals. They should each be responsible for the entirety of the crime. The argument that the killing was not premeditated and that the killing of Liu Huaizhou and Liu Qingxun was an unforeseeable fact is an empty excuse and should not be adopted. However, the defendant and Chen Fengshan killed three people simultaneously at the same place with a common intention. Although the result was a distinction between completed and attempted, it was a case of committing several crimes with one act. Therefore, the heavier punishment should be imposed. Furthermore, before the crime was discovered, the defendant surrendered himself to the officers and soldiers of the enforcement team stationed at the station. This has been certified by the Military Law Office of the Third Route Commander of the Punitive Expeditionary Army and is consistent with the statements of Li Fusheng, a member of the enforcement team, and Patrol Captain Bi Shizhen. The punishment for the principal crime should be reduced by one-third. Investigating the cause of the crime, it is indeed for the purpose of avenging his father, and the circumstances are still worthy of sympathy. The principal punishment should also be reduced by one-half. The two handguns and twenty-eight bullets and one bullet head used for the crime all belong to the defendant and should be confiscated.</p>
<p>Based on the above arguments, in addition to the co-offender Chen Fengshan's whereabouts being unknown and the trial being suspended, Zheng Jicheng's premeditated murder should be sentenced in accordance with Article 315 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Articles 42, 74, 284, Paragraph 1, Item 1, 38, Paragraph 1, 77, 87, 79, Paragraph 2, first section, 80, Paragraph 2, second section, 292, 57, Paragraph 5, 60, Item 2, 62, Paragraph 1, and 64 of the Criminal Law, with the judgment as stated in the main text.</p>
<p>This case was executed by Zhu Weiran, the prosecutor of this court, in court. The appellate court for this case is the Shandong High Court. The appeal period is ten days, starting from the date the judgment is served.

<h3 id="e87">Guangdong Provincial Bank Continues to Issue 3 Million New Fractional Currency Notes <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>To Recover Old Central Bank Notes</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangdong Provincial Bank previously issued 3 million yuan in provincial fractional currency notes, which are circulating in the market and are quite convenient. This 3 million yuan worth of one-yuan fractional currency notes is guaranteed by the provincial bank's preparation of 1.5 million yuan in cash, and the Finance Department's designation of two special taxes in Guangdong Province, the slaughter tax and the sugar tax, totaling over 2.92 million yuan in fractional silver. If an accident occurs and the cash is insufficient for redemption, the government will simultaneously add a paper tax to these two designated special taxes, collecting enough to cover the 1.5 million issued in new currency notes, and then stop adding the tax according to the plan. Since the issuance of the first phase of 3 million fractional currency notes, almost all of them have circulated in the market. Recently, because the Finance Department will unseal the Central Bank notes of various shops that were sealed last year starting on the 11th of this month, there are about 1.1 million yuan of redeemable Central Bank currency in this sealed amount. The Guangdong Provincial Bank is concerned that once these Central Bank notes are unsealed, a large number of Central Bank notes will suddenly flood the market for redemption, causing temporary congestion and hindering circulation. They consulted with the Finance Department and agreed to redeem all of these redeemable Central Bank notes with new fractional currency notes from the Guangdong Provincial Bank in order to regulate the situation and avoid affecting circulation. However, the 3 million new fractional currency notes issued in the first phase by the provincial bank have little left. Now, when the ten-yuan new fractional currency notes are approved to be used, the bank will also issue another 3 million new fractional currency notes. This second batch of 3 million new fractional currency notes is not limited to one-yuan or ten-yuan denominations, depending on temporary needs, in order to be used for redeeming old Central Bank notes when they are unsealed. Yesterday, the provincial bank prepared another 500,000 yuan in cash and redeemed 1 million yuan in Central Bank notes, and sent them to the Supervisory Committee for safekeeping, and received 3 million yuan in new fractional currency notes for issuance. The remaining 50% security deposit will be handled according to the first phase's plan. The Finance Department designated two special taxes in Guangdong Province, the slaughter of cattle and cattle skin tax of 1.2 million yuan in fractional silver, and the special tax on foreign paper of about 650,000 yuan in fractional silver, totaling over 1.85 million yuan, as the reserve fund for the second issuance of 3 million new fractional currency notes by the provincial bank. The Finance Department issued a public notice on the 16th. It has been found that merchants and people have been going to the provincial bank to receive these new fractional currency notes for days, and the reported amount received is over 2 million yuan, and the amount issued by the provincial bank for days has also been over 1.6 million yuan.

<h3 id="e89">Growing Unrest Over Land Tax in Jiangdu <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Villagers Storm County Government Office in Uproar</p>
<p>Over Two Hundred Men and Women Detained</p>
<p>A Yangzhou dispatch: The unrest over land tax inspection in the Second District of this county has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. The police squad of the Public Security Bureau detained fifty men and women the day before yesterday, sending them to the county for interrogation. Later, Cang Liuqi, the head of the Second District, requested the county government to order the villagers to write letters of repentance and release them. County Magistrate Yang replied that he needed to interrogate each person to find out who instigated them before they could be released on bail. This morning (the 22nd), County Magistrate Yang was personally holding court, conducting separate inquiries, when, unexpectedly, the villagers, due to the arrest of many people yesterday, beat drums all night, resulting in thousands of men and women villagers gathering early this morning. Each person held either long incense sticks, bamboo poles, or hoes, and they gathered at Dongguan of Xuningmen and the area facing the Fuyunmen across the river, guarding all the ferry crossings and preventing vegetable and manure carriers from entering the city. Upon hearing the news, the county government immediately telegraphed the police squad of the Public Security Bureau, ordering them to deploy police along the west bank of the canal to establish a tight defense. Around noon, the villagers suddenly seized several small ferries, desperately crossing the river, preparing to enter the city. Seeing the tense situation, the guarding soldiers and police successively closed the Dongguan, Fuyun, Xuning loopholes, and customs gates. Military and police officers went up to the city walls to persuade them, but the villagers' momentum was overwhelming. Finally, they completely gathered outside Fuyunmen, using force to break open the city gate and swarm into the city. At the same time, some people also crossed the wall and entered through Xuningmen. After entering the city, they divided into two routes, heading straight for the county government. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the shops in the city successively closed, and most residents did not dare to go out. Around 2:00 PM, the villagers had gathered at the gate of the county government. The guarding police squad immediately tried their best to stop them. County Magistrate Yang also stood on a wooden stool, intending to give a speech to persuade them, but the voices were too noisy, and the order became increasingly chaotic. In a moment, the villagers smashed the gate of the county government, damaging many of the walls on both sides. They successively rushed into the second gate, and even went to the First Squad of the Police Team to release the villagers arrested yesterday. They swarmed into the main hall of the county government and various offices, the Finance Bureau, the Tax Collection Office, the Police Brigade Headquarters, the Property Protection Association, the Bureau of Weights and Measures, and the county magistrate's residence, destroying everything. They tore up documents and contracts and burned them. When the villagers were about to rush into the county magistrate's residence, County Magistrate Yang escaped through the back door to the office of Central Committee Member Wang, asking for instructions, and notified the Independent Regiment stationed in Yangzhou by telephone, requesting them to send troops to the county government for joint defense. Chen, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and other personnel, who were also in the county government at that time, also exited through the back door. Regiment Commander Lu then immediately sent Deputy Officer Gao with a platoon of soldiers to suppress the situation. Four cavalry soldiers charged in front, clearing the way, allowing them to enter. Therefore, the villagers retreated to the outside of the gate. Subsequently, the Independent Regiment dispatched two more companies of soldiers to rush to the scene, surrounding the villagers from the east and west. The villagers also fled in droves. The army captured many people. The county government immediately notified the guarding soldiers and police at each city gate to close the city gates. The police squad of the Public Security Bureau then conducted separate searches. By 7:00 PM, they had detained about two hundred male and female villagers. All city gates were opened around 8:00 PM. Afterwards, the county government telegraphed reports to the provincial government, the Finance and Civil Affairs Departments, and the Security Office for approval. It was also learned that Wang Yuke, a county government clerk, was beaten by the villagers on the spot and has now been sent to the Bao Kang Hospital for treatment. The damaged items in the county government and the burned files have been photographed for record. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Li Yangjing Cables Account of Clash Between Military and Civilians in Chenghai <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>A Shantou dispatch: Some time ago, villagers from Guanshan Township in Chenghai County filed a complaint against the 20th Regiment of the Third Army for rape and robbery. For a time, misunderstandings arose between the military and the civilians, and the situation was quite tense. Later, Li Yangjing, the commander of the Third Army and concurrent Commissioner of Pacification for Eastern Guangdong, strictly investigated and handled the matter, and the situation was resolved. Li Yangjing has telegraphed a detailed report of the case to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee in Nanjing, the Political Affairs Committee of the Southwestern Executive Department in Guangzhou, the provincial government, and the Chaozhou and Shantou associations at home and abroad. The text is as follows: [Regarding the case where the villagers of Guanlong Township in Chenghai County in the jurisdiction killed soldiers of the Chaozhou and Shantou Coastal Security Team and soldiers of Feng Battalion Commander Zhefu of the 20th Regiment, who were ordered to go to the township to investigate and arrest the suspects in this case, and were filed a complaint by villagers Zhang Rennan and representative Yang Min'an, etc. for rape and plunder. I have repeatedly received orders from your committee, your government, and your department to investigate and handle the matter. In addition, I have also received telegrams from overseas Chinese groups inside and outside the country with the same information. I thought that the case was of great importance, and I had to conduct a strict investigation and repeated inquiries, which took a month. It was not until the Jia day of this month that the trial was concluded. Regarding the part of the case where the Security Team seized stolen goods on the river in the township and three team soldiers, including Li Yinfa, were killed by the villagers and three Browning pistols and 300 rounds of ammunition were lost, the testimony of Chen Weinan and Cai Zhanyuan, members of the Chenghai Anti-Japanese Association, and the statements of Zhou Ying, an assistant of the Chenghai Red Cross Branch, Zhang Yuan, the chief of the Shangpeng Public Security Sub-bureau, etc., as well as the various concrete evidence of seizing the corpse, purchasing coffins, burial, and erecting monuments on the same day, is sufficient to prove the facts. However, the local gentry Lu Shouyi, etc., jointly presented a report pushing the blame onto the Anti-Japanese Association, and have repeatedly failed to appear when summoned. Their attempts to cover up and evade investigation are even more obvious. As for the accusation of rape and plunder, the testimony of the so-called raped person, Zeng Xin, contains various contradictions that are too numerous to list. This is sufficient to prove that it is a fabrication. One: Zeng Xin stated that she was robbed of 700 yuan of silver for buying fish and more than ten pieces of clothing, with the clothing carried in ammunition belts and the silver coins held in her hands. However, the testimonies of her husband, Zeng Wanzong, her aunt Zeng Chen, and her husband's brother Zeng Wanqian and his wife all stated that she was carrying a fish stall and there were no such losses. This is sufficient to prove that it is a fabrication. Two: The loss list listed by Zhang Rennan totaled 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Regarding the paper money, Zhang Rennan stated that it was obtained from Nanyang, but the testimony of his wife Zhang Lu stated that it was the capital recovered from a joint venture that went bankrupt, so the source does not match. Regarding the gold jewelry, Zhang Rennan stated that the gold bracelet lost by his wife was placed under the bed in a wooden box, but the testimony of his wife Zhang Lu stated that it was placed in a small wooden cabinet in the sleeping bed, so the location does not match. According to Zhang Rennan, the four gold rings lost by his daughter-in-law were two that he bought for her, but the testimony of his daughter-in-law Zhang Chen stated that the four gold rings were all bought by her husband one after another, so the origin does not match. This is sufficient to prove that it is a fabrication. Three: Zhang Rennan is an unemployed returned overseas Chinese, with a house as small as a boat and bare walls. Repeated investigations have confirmed that the residents outside the house do not have a main gate. Even if there is such a thing, it would not be so careless as to hide wealth and invite robbery. This is sufficient to prove that it is a fabrication. Four: There are many other discrepancies that have been discussed before and after. Yangjing governs the army with strictness, but I still dare not believe that there was no violation at all. I have sent two officers to investigate secretly, and they have all stated that the accusations are false. I am still afraid that the officers are biased in their protection, so I summoned Xu Richu and Chen Zhi, the detectives sent by the Chenghai County government to guide Feng's troops to the township, to inquire in detail, and they also stated that nothing happened. Moreover, they stated that they did conduct a line-up search for guns when the troops were withdrawn, and they found dozens of copper coins on one soldier, and they were tied up and beaten before being released. All of this is the actual situation of the investigation of all the parties involved in this case. The matter concerns fabrication and attempts to evade responsibility, and while the matter was under strict investigation, the township representatives Yang Min'an and Zhang Rennan, etc., knowing that the false accusation could not be concealed, suddenly sent a telegram explaining on Jing day, which stated that due to the incident of the military coming to investigate the killing and disappearance of the Security Team in the township last month, the villagers misunderstood and fled in droves. The accusations of rape and robbery were made by people from other townships who did not understand the truth. One person spread a rumor, and a hundred people believed it, leading to extreme words and disputes. In fact, when the troops came to the township at that time, they strictly adhered to discipline, etc. At the same time, they jointly presented a report to the office, willing to donate 15,000 yuan for public welfare expenses, requesting lenient treatment and exemption from investigation, and requesting the release of Lin Rongfa and others who were detained and the cancellation of the case. Considering that the villagers were ignorant and incited, and they had already confessed their mistakes, I have approved lenient handling, removed the case, and allocated the donated public welfare expenses to Shantou Sanmin New Village, etc., for subsidies. I will separately submit a report to your committee and department for review and record. (Omitted below)</p>

He has been imprisoned for fifty days. Although various parties and local gentry have repeatedly requested his release, he has not been able to get his wish because Zhu usually held fair opinions and had long offended Zhao. Now that the case has been transferred from administrative punishment to the judicial scope, Zhu has entrusted three major lawyers, Chen Tingrui, Zhang Ji, and Qian Langxi, to file an appeal with the Shanghai District Court according to law. It is now heard that the court has scheduled the trial for 10:00 AM on the 26th of this month and has already issued notices to both parties.</p>

<p>Party Committee Member Detained for Seducing Young Woman: Dong Zhongxing, a member of the Reorganization Committee of the Yixing County Party Committee, is lustful. On the morning of the 17th of this month, Dong suddenly lured and abducted Yu Shao, the daughter-in-law of Yu of Yixing County, and secretly came to Wuxi by wheel. Unfortunately, his plan was spoiled when Shi Youliang and others from Yixing caught sight of him. Dong knew he could not hide the truth and directly admitted to seducing a married woman. When the wheel arrived at the Wuxi wharf, Shi immediately reported to the Sixth Branch of the local Public Security Bureau, which sent police to detain both the man and woman. After Bureau Member Zhang held a preliminary hearing, he leniently released the Party Committee member, considering his prominent position, and ordered Dong Zhongxing to write a letter of repentance to close the case. Afterwards, the members of the Party Committee in various districts of Yixing and local public figures were greatly angered and filed petitions with the provincial Party Committee, urging a thorough investigation and sending representatives to the province to request the removal of the Reorganization Committee member from his post and severe punishment.</p>

<p>Construction Department Plans to Build Tongxu Railway: The Construction Department believes that the coastal area of Jiangbei is rich in products, but transportation is inconvenient, making it difficult to export goods. Moreover, the seaports are fragmented, which also has a significant impact on national defense. Therefore, it plans to build the Tongxu Railway, passing through Nantong, Rugao, Taixian, Dongtai, Yancheng, Funing, and Huaiyin, and reaching Xuzhou, as a branch line of the Longhai Railway. It has now appointed engineer Wang Shixi and others to come to Tong to survey the planned route. Military Police Escort on the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River: Recently, pirates have been appearing frequently in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The county magistrates of Tonghaiqi and the chief of the Fourth District of the Water Police, as well as the local military commanders, convened representatives of the Chinese shipping companies operating in the lower reaches of the river in Tong to discuss escort measures. They decided to search and suppress the bandit dens in Hupu with the military police and submit a report to the province to organize an escort team to ensure safety.</p>

A few days ago, Wang Tianmu and Xie Hengxiang and other shops in Xixing were caught smuggling a large quantity of Japanese goods by the County Anti-Japanese Association. The seized cloth was transferred to the city for review and sealing. At the same time, letters were sent to the supplier shops to impose penalties.</p>

Most families with little savings closed their doors. Fortunately, the Guali police station and the local village police collected silver and rice to send them out of the area that night, heading towards Anchang.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Preparations for Chinese Art Exhibition <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Preparatory Committee Established</p>
<p>Chinese and German Committee Members Appointed</p>
<p>In May of last year, the Ministry of Education approved a letter from the Central Research Institute, which had received a letter from the Chinese Embassy in Germany, stating that since European civilization gradually spread to the East, our ancient Asian civilization has felt that it is behind in everything except for art, in which it can still stand out and compete with Europeans. The Japanese know this and are doing their best to promote Oriental painting and widely promote it in various European countries, pretending to represent Eastern Asian civilization. Recently, the Japanese government has provided 80,000 marks to the Imperial Academy of Art to exhibit the works of more than one hundred modern Japanese painters on a large scale in the Prussian Academy of Art in Berlin. It plans to transport these paintings to various important cities in Germany for exhibition, causing people throughout Germany to spread the word and admire Japanese art. In fact, Japanese painting was originally introduced from our country, and to this day, it still only imitates our country as much as possible. However, our country has never paid attention to publicity, so in the eyes of Europeans, Eastern civilization is only Japan, and not China. Fortunately, there are many people in Germany who study Eastern art and especially appreciate our country's art. Therefore, they automatically opened a Chinese art exhibition two years ago, displaying Chinese ancient paintings, ancient sculptures, ancient bronzes, jade, porcelain, embroidery, etc. for more than a month, which was quite sensational. Unfortunately, the collection was hastily assembled, and the content was not very sufficient, which the Germans deeply regretted. They repeatedly inquired with our embassy, believing that if the Chinese government and the leaders of the educational and art circles could promote and support it, the Germans would be willing to hold another Chinese exhibition to refresh the minds of the new German art world. Therefore, the Chinese Academy of the Buddha in Frankfurt initiated a Chinese art exhibition, which was established with the full assistance of Liu Haisu, the president of the Shanghai School of Fine Arts. It opened on March 19, and a large number of people attended. The number of people who came to view the exhibition every day was endless. However, although Frankfurt is one of the major cities in Germany, it is not as important as the capital. Therefore, President Haisu was invited to visit Berlin. After his arrival, our embassy held a tea party, inviting leaders from the art, political, and academic circles to welcome and discuss the results. German people unanimously hoped that Haisu would hold another large-scale exhibition of modern Chinese paintings in Berlin within two years. On the spot, it was decided that Chinese and German people would jointly organize a preparatory committee. The German side would be led by the German East Asian Art Association, and the Chinese side would be led by the Central Research Institute. The exhibition location would still be the Prussian Academy of Art, and no rent would be charged for the venue. However, the transportation costs of the items, insurance fees, and miscellaneous expenses for the layout of the venue would be covered by the income from the admission tickets. If the income was insufficient, a reserve fund of 30,000 marks would be prepared to make up for the shortfall. The Germans proposed that this fund be borne by the Chinese side. Our embassy believes that this fund can be requested by your academy to the Ministry of Education to be transferred to the National Government for subsidies. The names of the German preparatory committee members are listed above. The Chinese side plans to have your academy president and President Haisu, along with representatives of our embassy, join as preparatory members. Please indicate whether this is appropriate. The Research Institute is very supportive of this matter, but it involves educational administration and has sent a letter to the Ministry of Education to preside over it. The Ministry of Education believes that this overseas publicity is very important for promoting our country's art and should be assisted by the country to achieve its success. It has replied to the Research Institute that this matter should be jointly handled by your academy and this ministry. More than a year has passed, and it has not been handled for two reasons: one is due to financial reasons, and the other is that the time limit for holding the exhibition within two years has not yet become urgent.</p>
<p>In June of this year, the Ministry of Education approved a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that Liang Long, the acting charge d'affaires in Germany, stated the same reasons as before. The matter was presented to the 40th meeting of the Executive Yuan and approved. The Minister of Education, the President of the Central Research Institute, the President of the Beiping Research Institute, the Chinese Ambassador to Germany, Chen Shuren, Ye Gongchuo, Liu Haisu, Gao Qifeng, and Xu Beihong have been appointed as members of the exhibition preparatory committee. The committee members held their first meeting in Shanghai on August 6 and decided to establish a preparatory office that day, attached to the International Exchange Office of Publications of the Central Research Institute. Cai Yuanpei, Ye Gongchuo, Chen Shuren, Xu Beihong, and Liu Haisu were elected as standing committee members, with Cai as chairman. The 30,000 mark reserve fund required by the association has been approved by President Wang of the Executive Yuan, who has ordered the Ministry of Railways to allocate the existing funds under Ye's name (more than 40,000 yuan), according to the amount of the reserve fund (30,000 marks) approved by the 42nd meeting of the Executive Yuan, to the preparatory office for its use. The German preparatory committee members are Dr. Salvo, the former German ambassador to China and the president of the East Asian Art Association, Dr. Klumpp, the vice president of the association and a doctor of engineering, Dr. Kmer, a professor at the University of Berlin, Dr. Silber, the chief accountant of the association, Count Haio, the deputy director, Bai Shumen, a professor at the Berlin University of Technology, Dr. Klachow, the director of the National Art Library, the deputy director of publication in charge of the National Museum, and a representative of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>Those Who Have Not Passed the Certification Examination... Will Not Be Allowed to Serve as Teachers</p>
<p>Zhou, the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, in view of the lack of teachers in elementary schools in various counties and the fact that teachers have often evaded the certification examinations held in the past, has scheduled the fourth certification examination for April 3rd to 5th of next year. He has specifically issued a public notice to the education bureaus of various counties, ordering all elementary school teachers who have not passed the certification examination to take the examination on time to comply with the regulations. In the future, elementary school teachers who have not passed the certification examination and obtained a permit will not be allowed to be employed. The original order is as follows:</p>
<p>The elementary school teacher examination and certification is an important policy for alleviating the current shortage of teachers and a method for carefully selecting talent and improving education. The department has held it several times and has already provided detailed explanations. It is expected that everyone understands. Now, it is found that there are still many unqualified teachers serving in elementary schools in various counties, and many people who should take the examination and certification have often evaded the examination under various pretexts, which is contrary to the department's intention to carefully select teachers. It is now scheduled that April 3rd to 5th, 22nd year of the Republic, will be the date for the fourth elementary school teacher examination and certification. The registration period is stipulated to be from the date of receiving this order until January 31st, 22nd year of the Republic. The registration fee is originally one yuan and one jiao in consideration of the financial difficulties of elementary school teachers, but it will be reduced by five jiao for this session. All zoning methods and registration review procedures will be handled in accordance with the regulations of the previous certification examination. Once the registration and examination dates for this session are stipulated, they will not be extended. The bureau directors of each county should comply with the stipulated deadlines and order all unqualified elementary school teachers to register for the examination without allowing them to evade it. After this session of certification, all unqualified elementary school teachers will not be allowed to be employed unless they have passed the certification examination. The department aims to rectify teacher fees and will not tolerate any leniency. All elementary school teachers who should take the examination and certification should not wait and see and cause themselves harm. In addition to issuing separate orders, this urgent order is issued to the bureau directors to comply with and handle it, and to inform the public. This is of utmost importance. This order,</p>

Seeing the excellent performance of your spirit and physique, you are well prepared to save the country. However, the future of saving the country depends on you young people. Without a strong physique and a valiant spirit, it would be difficult to save the country (that is, the future leaders of China will be you young people). Commander Dai just said that he hopes you will continue to work hard in training and prepare to save the country in the future. This is also my sincere hope. In the future, defeating Japan and defeating all imperialists will depend on you young people. I hope you will not forget to save the country and strive forward."</p>

<h3 id="e104">The West Union Football League: Jinan Shows Early Promise <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Defeated the Shanghai Westerners Team 3-0</p>
<p>| Created a Three-Game Winning Streak |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jinan football team defeated the Shanghai Westerners team 3-0 at the China baseball field. Four to five thousand people watched as Jinan showed early promise and immediately secured victory. The current Westerners team's strength is relatively weak, and their offense and defense both feel weak. In addition, their star player, Sinclair, was injured in the last game against Weidehi and was unable to play yesterday, which further diminished their strength.</p>
<p>Jinan's Shooting Was Slightly Off: Jinan's performance yesterday did not seem to fully utilize their strengths, and their teamwork was not very tight. Fortunately, the defense was safe and sound, with few dangerous moments. The forwards were also somewhat careless, and their shooting was inaccurate, missing many opportunities. The forwards' movements were slightly slow, and they often failed to take advantage of opportunities to break through and score when they reached the opponent's goal. If they can pay attention to this point, the team has great prospects. Yesterday's Westerners team had a very weak forward line, the defense was not solid, and only the goalkeeper was good. Stoker's move to center-back was quite effective.</p>
<p>Luo Haiguang's Excellent Skills: The game started at 3 PM, with Jinan attacking first, putting all their energy into besieging the Westerners' goal from all sides. However, they struggled to find an opportunity. Later, Chen Zhenhe created a scoring opportunity and was about to strike, but his younger brother Zhenxiang was offside, negating the play. Then, Chen Zhenhe stole the ball from the opponent's feet and sent it far forward. Zhenxiang, Haiguang, and Hong Bao tested their scissor formation, passing back and forth, making it difficult for the opponent to track them and waiting for an opportunity. Finally, Luo Haiguang suddenly shot the ball from the right corner of the goal, and it went into the net with a loud sound, which was very beautiful.</p>
<p>Wang Nanzhen's Wonderful Shot: The Westerners' right wing once made a deep solo run, but returned without attacking. Chen Zhenhe led the attack again and saw that the left side was empty, so he sent the ball far over. New left-wing general Wang Nanzhen returned it to the front of the goal, and Chen Zhenxiang safely got the ball in an unguarded spot. However, he was too hasty and missed the shot, resulting in a wild pitch. Jinan's aggressive offensive meant that there were many scoring opportunities. Luo Haiguang had three chances but failed to take advantage of them. Three fierce shots went over the goal, which was a great pity. Chen Zhenhe accurately spotted Mei Hongshi and sent out a corner kick, which was headed towards the goal, but was caught again. Jinan repeatedly missed opportunities, which was regrettable, but the team was spirited and fought hard. Chen Zhenhe orchestrated well, Luo Haiguang shuttled from the middle, and Wang Nanzhen shot powerfully at the goal, the ball flying swiftly into the net. This goal was a successful example of the forwards' teamwork, and the excellent shot made it even more impressive. Jinan led 2-0 at halftime.</p>
<p>Mo Tan Got His Wish: "Little Black Coal" Chen Zhenhe orchestrated the entire team and worked hard, but he often failed to command as he wished and could not fulfill his ambitions. In the 20th minute of the second half, Mo Tan struggled to fight the enemy, broke through three barriers, and went deep into the enemy's camp. He received a pass from Luo Haiguang and succeeded, making the score 3-0. Afterwards, Haiguang and others attacked fiercely again, and Black Coal shot another goal, but failed to score. Mei Hongbao repeatedly joked with the enemy and made few contributions. The situation in the second half was uneventful.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Youyou Exhausted and Defeated <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Weidexia Won 9-2</p>
<p>Each Scored Two Goals in the First Half</p>
<p>| A Scene from the First Division Football League |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Youyou football team drew 2-2 with the strong British Weidexia team at Yiyuan. However, this was the result of the first half. In the second half, Youyou completely collapsed and conceded seven consecutive goals, resulting in a 9-2 defeat. This was a game from the West Union First Division League. There were few spectators, mostly foreign soldiers with blond hair and blue eyes.</p>
<p>Youyou Missed Many Opportunities: Youyou's individual skills were acceptable, but the team's teamwork was poor. The passing was inaccurate, and they could not grasp the direction and distance, which meant that the ball was often intercepted by the enemy. The movements were very slow, and many good opportunities were missed. Zhu Qiu and Qian Yaobin performed the best. Rao Huisheng, unfortunately, was old and slow, allowing the enemy to break through many times.</p>
<p>Observations of Weidexia: The Weidexia team showed their true strength in the second half and proved to be a formidable force. Most commendable was that everyone had hard kicks that made a loud sound. The five forwards were like dragons and tigers in the second half, and the left and right wing shots were incredibly accurate. The center line was also good, but the defense was slightly weaker, and the goalkeeper had a weakness of panicking and always throwing the ball out with his hands, which was dangerous and unreliable.</p>
<p>Youyou Fought to a Draw: In the first half, Youyou attacked the enemy's goal and had many good opportunities, but the lack of teamwork allowed the opponent to defend. After 15 minutes, Kirk's left-wing pass was headed in by center forward Beggle. Ten minutes later, in the same manner, O'Er attacked, and Liang jumped up to catch the ball, but Beggle's header was too fast and it was headed in again, giving the team a 2-0 lead. With 15 minutes remaining, Sun Huipei got the ball on the left and wanted to shoot, but he didn't. The center forward shot, and the goalkeeper threw it out. Zhu Qiu rushed in and sent it straight into the goal. The goalkeeper caught it and held it down, but Xi Qiaosheng rushed in, and the ball had already crossed the white line, so it was judged to be a goal. In the last seven minutes, Xi Qiaosheng dribbled the ball straight in, broke through several barriers, and quickly passed to the left wing. The area was empty, and Sun Huipei shot it in, making the score 2-2 at halftime.</p>
<p>Exhausted, They Completely Collapsed: The surprising result of the first half was completely unexpected. The unrecoverable situation in the second half was due to, in a word, exhaustion from fiercely defending in the first half. The area in front of the goal became the enemy's world. They conceded four goals in 20 minutes: (1) Xu Lan, (2) Haines, (3) O'Er, (4) Haines. Later, they lost a penalty kick, which was sacrificed by Sun Huipei. Finally, they conceded three more goals: (1) Beggle, (2) Palmero, (3) Beggle, ending the game 9-2.</p>

Lin played the first set against Lun in the morning and finished it in the afternoon with scores of 6-3, 6-2, and 6-2. This was very impressive. Lun Qiang was slightly diminished, while Lin was exceptionally good. His serves were powerful and he completely defeated Lun Qiang. Xu Huipei Defeats Hui Te: Xu is an 18-year-old rising star from Hong Kong. His speed and accuracy made it impossible for Hui Te to run. The Two Luns Defeat Lin and Zheng: Shanghai took a 5-2 lead in the first set, but lost the set due to Zheng's repeated double faults and net touches. Shanghai was still diminished in the second set, and Zheng's double faults were still frequent. Although Lin's serve was good, the two Luns won with perfect cooperation. Shanghai took a 4-1 lead in the third set, but due to Zheng's weakness, the ball often went out of bounds and touched the net. The two Luns were very steady and deserved to win.</p>
<p>In total, Shanghai won three matches and Hong Kong won two.</p>

<h3 id="e112">New Basketball Techniques (18) (Do Not Reprint) Original Author: Claire Burcky, Translated by Zhang Guoxun and Qian Yiqin <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Walter E. Meanwell, basketball coach at the University of Wisconsin, teaches his team to focus on fast attacks, quick passes, agile turns, and blocking opponents. The diagram shows one of Dr. Meanwell's techniques for throwing the ball in from the sidelines during an attack.</p>
<p>Player #1 stands outside the sideline in the opponent's zone and throws the ball in. Player #2 takes a few steps forward, tricking their defender into thinking they will receive the ball and shoot. Then, they run to near Player #3 and stop. At this time, Player #3's defender will be blocked by Player #2. Player #3 can rush forward to the space left by Player #2 and receive the ball from Player #1. Player #1 passes the ball to Player #3, who turns and dribbles the ball into an open space, shooting from 10 feet away from the basket. Otherwise, they can pass the ball to Player #4 or #5, who are running towards the basket.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Chairman Lin's Arrival in Shanghai from Fujian Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>A Short Stay of Three or Four Days Before Returning to Nanjing</p>
<p>Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at approximately 6:00 AM aboard the China Navigation Company's ship "Zhenyijianala" from Xiamen, accompanied by his aides Lin Zhitang and Ben Ding. However, due to fog, the ship was delayed and only arrived at around 11:00 AM, docking at the Pootung (Pudong) Blue Funnel Wharf. The Shanghai Municipal Police Commissioner, Wen Hong'en, and Fujian Provincial Government Committee member Jiang Pingfan, along with others, went to the wharf to welcome him. In addition to dispatching an armed police squad to protect the wharf, the Third District Police Bureau of Pootung, the Shanghai Municipal Government also sent Captain Zhang Zhensheng leading a military band to the wharf to welcome him. After disembarking, Chairman Lin transferred to a police launch and crossed the river to the Jianghai Customs Wharf, then quickly returned to his private residence on Rue du Père Robert (Jin Shenfu Road) to rest. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Land Bureau Director Jin Liren, and Lin's relatives and friends, including Lin Wojiang, visited him one after another. At 4:00 PM, Lin went out to visit friends. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to Lin's residence yesterday afternoon to present his card and pay his respects, inquiring about the recent situation in Fujian Province. According to Lin, he had been away from Fujian for a long time, and this return visit made him feel that the municipal administration of Fujian Province had made progress compared to before, and that Xiamen had progressed even faster. As for the rumors that the Fujian Provincial Government would be reorganized, he said he was not aware of it. The Central Government would naturally rectify any dysfunctional organizations. As for the 19th Route Army's entry into Fujian to suppress bandits, they had achieved repeated successes, and the front line had already advanced to the Longyan area. The remaining bandits would soon be wiped out. Chen Guohui was still in custody and would be tried by a military tribunal, which was planned to be jointly established by the Fujian Provincial Government, the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and the courts. Lin said that he had already submitted his opinions on the investigation team's report to the Foreign Affairs Committee for discussion, because it concerned foreign affairs, and it was currently inconvenient to make it public. Lin plans to stay in Shanghai for a short time, and will return to Nanjing in three or four days.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Zhang Boling Discusses the Situation in Shandong <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Liu's Occupation of Jiaodong Interferes with Civil Administration</p>
<p>Han's Rash Initiation of Warfare is Also Unforgivable</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Zhang Boling, the president of Nankai University, came to Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday to report to the Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance on the process of mediating the war between Han Fuqu and Liu Zhennian in Shandong. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Zhang at the Xinhuizhong Inn yesterday to inquire about the situation and future of the Shandong war. Zhang replied as follows:</p>
<p>Occupying Jiaodong: Although Liu Zhennian's troops are called a division, they are actually tens of thousands of soldiers. For several years, they have occupied twelve counties in Jiaodong, appointing and removing local officials, and their military expenses are obtained locally. After Han Fuqu took charge of the provincial administration, he tried his best to unify the administration of the entire province. Although local officials in Jiaodong were gradually appointed by the provincial government, Liu's monthly military expenses were determined by Minister He of the Ministry of Military Administration to be 170,000 yuan, with 100,000 yuan allocated by the Central Government each month and 70,000 yuan subsidized by Shandong Province. Later, the Shandong Provincial Government agreed to increase the subsidy to 100,000 yuan, but Liu Zhennian insisted that Shandong Province must subsidize 150,000 yuan. After several consultations, it was only agreed to reduce it to 145,000 yuan, otherwise it would still be obtained from the defense area. Thus, the war started.</p>
<p>Concentrated in Three Counties: Liu Zhennian's troops were prepared for the war early, and stored grain in the three counties of Yexian, Laiyang, and Jimo, and built defense works. Therefore, as soon as the war started, Liu's troops abandoned other places and retreated to the three counties, and Han's troops took a siege formation. When I (Zhang refers to himself below) arrived in Jinan, Han Fuqu was already in Weixian, and I immediately sent a telegram to inform him that I would go to meet him. The next day, Jiang Bocheng returned from Weixian and said that it was not necessary to go, and Han would return to Jinan soon. So I waited in Jinan for Han to return. When we met, I advised him that in this critical period of national crisis, civil war should not be initiated under any circumstances, so as not to give enemy countries an excuse. Han also deeply agreed, but he could not bear to let the people of Jiaodong be ravaged by Liu, since he was in charge of the provincial administration. Then the Central Government sent Commissioners Fan and Li to Shandong to investigate, but in reality, it had already entered a stalemate. I then left Shandong.</p>
<p>Key to the Solution: To be fair, Han Fuqu's achievements in governing Shandong and his military discipline are commendable, and cannot be compared with what Liu Zhennian did in Jiaodong. However, he launched the war without asking for instructions from the Central Government, which is also unforgivable. Now Han Fuqu firmly insists that Liu's troops leave Shandong Province. In principle, since Liu's troops are part of the national army, the Central Government has the right to decide where Liu is stationed, and local officials should not be allowed to have any preferences. The key to the problem should be that the troops should not interfere in civil administration, which is the proper way. The solution in the future should also be that Liu's troops should reduce their defense area and not interfere in civil administration.</p>
<p>Returning North Tomorrow: Zhang came south this time to attend the physical education conference convened by the Ministry of Education (which closed on the 20th). He stayed in Shanghai for four days. In addition to attending the Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance and the Physical Education Promotion Association meetings, he was invited to give speeches at Shanghai Middle School (the day before yesterday), Wuben Girls' High School (today), and the anniversary of the founding of the school. The Nankai University Alumni Association held a banquet at the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge yesterday afternoon. He was very busy with socializing and giving speeches. He will return north tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Tibetan Lamas Telegraph Request for Troop Deployment to Defend Against Tibet <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Shen Shi Telegraph Agency met yesterday with Jie Shengjun, the representative of the Sichuan Provincial Government, who showed him a recent telegram from various Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in Xikang, hoping to cease hostilities and defend against foreign aggression. The telegram is recorded below (titles omitted):</p>
<p>We lamas have grown up in the borderlands and are unable to receive the same protection as the people in the interior. Since the founding of the Republic of China, Tibetan troops have invaded, and under the force of violence, we have suffered all kinds of abuses. By the seventh year of the Republic, Tibetan troops had occupied the hinterland of Xikang, leaving only thirteen counties in the area of Pida River. Alas, we Kang people have since felt the extreme bitterness of being in deep water and scorching fire. People have ear taxes, animals have hoof taxes, food is plundered, and women are subjected to their lewd abuse. The extent of the cruelty is too much to describe. In June of the nineteenth year, monks from Dajie Monastery colluded with Tibetan troops and started a conflict, which has dragged on for two years, and Ganzhan has fallen. The people of Xikang have been looking forward day and night to the Central Government's furious anger and strictly ordering Commander-in-Chief Liu to lead his troops out of the pass to launch a large-scale punitive expedition. However, because the Tibetan situation is treacherous, they have secretly purchased and transported foreign weapons and actively increased their troops, while on the surface they are still loyal to the Central Government and conducting reconciliation. This has been ambiguous and suspended until now. Fortunately, the Central Government has seen through their treachery and ordered Commander-in-Chief Liu in March of this year to be responsible for handling the affairs of Xikang. He then mustered his troops and launched an attack on schedule. The Tibetans again took the initiative, intending to gain an inch after another. Relying on the commander's leadership and the soldiers' dedication, they recovered Ganzhan in one battle, and Deg, Dengke, and Baiyu counties in the next. There are no more traces of Tibetan troops on the east bank of the Jinsha River. We hope that we can continue our efforts to pacify the whole of Xikang, so that the people in various places who are groaning under the iron hooves of the Tibetan bandits can all enjoy peace and security, avenge their long-standing grievances, and promote national prestige. According to what the lamas have seen and heard, the garrison on the east bank of the Jinsha River has been prepared and should be able to advance in one go and recover all the lost land. However, it has been delayed for a long time and is still silent. After suspicion and questioning, we have investigated everywhere and learned that a war is about to break out in eastern Sichuan. The officers and soldiers on the front line are deeply afraid of being implicated and cut off from support, and cannot help but hesitate and delay. The lamas initially did not believe it, thinking it must be just rumors. After detailed investigation, it seems to be true. However, we still believe that in this critical period of national crisis, when the people of the country are advocating the abolition of civil war, no ambitious military man would dare to risk such a great injustice. Moreover, Supervising Commissioner Liu, who is stationed in eastern Sichuan, is about to send troops to Hubei Province to help the country in its emergency. How could he be manipulated by others to engage in fratricide and allow one or two trouble-makers to stir up internal strife? Judging from reason and principle, this cannot be true. However, according to the reliable news recently transmitted from the stove merchants, the situation in eastern Sichuan has taken a sharp turn for the worse. If we do not quickly seek to eliminate it, it will inevitably hinder the overall plan and affect the situation in Xikang. The efforts of half a year of bloody battles will be in vain. Thinking of the future, we are extremely worried. Considering that Commander-in-Chief Liu has taken on this difficult task of using troops against Tibet with the strength of one region, and has not hesitated to make great sacrifices to drive the Tibetan troops to the west bank of the Jinsha River in a short period of time, the Central Government should be concerned about the defense of the western border and give him sufficient material assistance and superior spiritual support, so that he can concentrate on achieving complete success and permanently secure the situation in Xikang. Unexpectedly, things have not gone as hoped and obstacles have arisen, and the crisis is imminent. The lamas are as close to the Han people as to heaven and hate the Tibetans as enemies. The pain is deeply felt and it is difficult to remain silent. As a last resort, we can only telegraph to you, the gentlemen of the central government, ordering Supervising Commissioner Liu of Chongqing to immediately cancel war preparations and stop military actions, so as not to endanger national defense and make it impossible to clean up. At the same time, Commander-in-Chief Liu is still responsible for concentrating his forces and focusing on Tibet. We also hope that our military and political authorities and organizations in the capital and abroad will unanimously advocate and jointly stop the outbreak of the Sichuan War in order to consolidate national defense. The telegram is of the utmost urgency and imploring. Signed by the lamas of Ding'an Que Monastery, Nanwu Monastery, Zhuwo Monastery in Luhuo, Shou'ning Monastery, Huiyuan Monastery in Daofu, Donggu Monastery in Garze, Jiazi Monastery in Zhanhua, Alu Monastery in Dege, Gatuo Monastery in Baiyu, and Dingning Monastery in Ba'an.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Cai Yuanpei and Others Rescue Chen Duxiu <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfo, Liu Yazi, Lin Yutang, and other leaders of Shanghai's academic circles sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang and the National Government in Nanjing. The text is as follows:</p>
<p>To the Central Committee of the Kuomintang and the National Government in Nanjing: We have heard that Chen Duxiu was arrested and sent to Nanjing while he was ill, and we are very concerned. This man promoted revolution in his early years and co-founded the "Guomin Ribao" in Shanghai with Zhang Puquan and Zhang Xingyan. After the Restoration, he assisted Bai Liewu in governing Anhui and made contributions. During the May Fourth Movement, he advocated new culture and indirectly helped the National Revolution. These contributions should not be erased by personal grudges. Unfortunately, due to differences in political views, he went astray. However, because he opposed the policy of violence and condemned the Red Army as bandits, he was expelled from the Communist Party. He is actually no different from the Communist Party members in the parliaments of various constitutional countries in Europe and America. We hope that you will show compassion for the old and cherish talent, and give him a chance to reform himself. It would be a great blessing for academia and culture. We await your orders with trepidation.</p>

<p>Need Gas Masks: The Shanghai Office of the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association received a telegram from the chief director of the headquarters, stating: "According to a report from Su Bingwen's troops, the Japanese have used poison gas to attack their army. All volunteer armies have similar reports. Please prepare gas masks as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Acquired Military Supplies: The Guowen News Agency recently received a telegram from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the People of Northeast China in Beiping, stating: "Ma Zhanshan telegraphed that the Fourth Route Army's Song Xihe Brigade destroyed a section of the Qike Line railway from Yucheng to Yangjiatun west of Tai'an Town, and ambushed their troops on the side of the road. At 8:00 PM, an enemy armored train heading towards Tai'an Pass was derailed. The ambushing troops launched a fierce attack, killing more than a dozen enemies and capturing thirty-two, obtaining more than a hundred large and small guns, more than ten thousand rounds of ammunition, and a train of military supplies. The remnants of the enemy retreated to Lazhan, and our army pursued them. Xu Haiting of the Fourth Route Army has gone to reinforce them and is advancing towards the provincial capital."</p>
<p>Obtained Spoils of War: The Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association in this city recently received a telegram from the Propaganda Department of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the People of Northeast China in Beiping, stating: "The Liaoning and Jilin Commissioners reported that the volunteer army led by Zheng Guilin attacked the Sui Zhong Qian Wei and Qian Suo stations at Jiangwan, and fought fiercely all night before the battle ended at dawn. More than a hundred Japanese troops advanced from Liaoyang towards Benxi. At Dongshan Zuizi, they were ambushed and defeated by the volunteer armies led by Xia Dian. They changed their route and returned to Liaoyang. The volunteer army obtained many spoils of war."</p>

<p>Shanghai Support Association Need Not Worry</p>
<p>The Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association previously telegraphed to the headquarters of the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association in Beiping to inquire about the truth, because the Fourth Route Army Commander of the Liaoning Volunteer Army sent a representative to Shanghai to request assistance from the association. Now it is learned that the association received a reply telegram from Beiping yesterday, stating that they have already unified leadership, and the Shanghai side need not worry. The original telegram reads: "To the standing directors of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association: We have received your telegram. The guidance of the Volunteer Army is now unified. Geng Jizhou, commander of the Fourth Route Army of the Liaoning Volunteer Army, is directly under the Liaoning Headquarters.

<p>Recruiting Members for the Eighth Sanitation Team</p>
<p>To Be Deployed to the Northeast for Anti-Japanese Resistance Upon Completion</p>
<p>Zhong Zhaojun, director of the China Sanatorium for Wounded Soldiers from the Front Lines, previously formed the Seventh Sanitation Team with a total of 234 people, led by team leader Hu Jinlai, which was sent to the Northeast on the 28th of last month to provide on-site assistance to wounded anti-Japanese volunteer soldiers, in view of the hard battles fought by the Northeast Volunteer Army and the lack of aid for wounded soldiers. Details have been published in various newspapers. It has now been learned that the Ninth Branch of the Sanatorium has established an office in Shanghai, and Liang Shaotang has been appointed as the director. He has now started to organize the Eighth Sanitation Team and is recruiting members. Once the recruitment is completed, they will continue to be deployed to the Northeast to participate in the anti-Japanese war.</p>
<h3 id="e120">News from the Volunteer Army Rescue Team Yesterday <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Rescue Team has been actively preparing for departure since establishing an office at the Sanmei Temple in Xiaonanmen. Yesterday, the team held a medical knowledge exam. The results showed that only a few people passed. Starting today, the team will begin training in rescue work. Donations from all walks of life continue to pour in. Yesterday, Xia Yingdao, vice president of the Shanghai Branch of the World Red Cross Society, donated 20 yuan to the team, and Yao Xin donated 20 yuan. Other groups and individuals have also made donations.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Various Sectors Concerned about Winter Clothing for the Volunteer Army <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The weather in late autumn will soon turn to severe winter. The thin clothing of the soldiers fighting the enemy in the cold is a concern for patriots. The Shanghai Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association received remittances and suggestions from various parties yesterday, as follows:</p>
<p>Hangzhou Remittances for Winter Clothing: A letter from the Hangzhou National Products Factory United Association stated: "Dear Sirs, the Northeast Volunteer Army is fighting bravely against Japan, which is admired by all. We have raised 360 yuan from our members to purchase winter clothing for the Volunteer Army. It has been remitted to the Bank of China in Hangzhou. Please acknowledge receipt and forward a letter of thanks."</p>
<p>Repurpose Condolence Banners by Dyeing: Gu Xiyuan of the Zhenxing Wool Spinning Factory, a member of the Shanghai Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association, suggested to the association yesterday: "Dear Sirs, autumn is high in the borderlands, and severe winter is approaching. The isolated army in the wilderness lacks clothing and equipment. I suggest that we make use of the condolence banners and other cloth items discarded at funerals by various sectors (such as the more than ten thousand pairs of condolence banners from the memorial service for the former 19th Route Army), dye them, and then collect artificial cotton and other materials. Tens of thousands of winter clothes can be made quickly. This would be of great benefit to the Northeast Volunteer Army. If my humble suggestion is adopted, I am willing to contribute my efforts to the dyeing. Please make a public decision and implement it."</p>
<p>Dangtu Party Headquarters Remittances: The association received a remittance of 206 yuan from the Dangtu County Party Affairs Rectification Committee in Anhui (letter omitted).</p>

<p>Please Advocate by the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce and Lawyers Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association believes that support work should be widespread. In addition to sending Chu Huiseng to Hangzhou to contact and organize the Zhejiang Provincial Support Association, it also sent letters to the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce and the Lawyers Association, stating: "Dear Sirs, it has been more than a year since the Northeast fell. The people of the three provinces cannot bear the trampling of the Japanese invaders and have risen up to organize volunteer armies to resist the stubborn enemy. After years of fighting, their achievements have shaken the world. However, they lack supplies and ammunition. The recovery of lost territory depends on the active support of the people of the country. Our association has been appealing for donations for half a year, but the amount raised is always a drop in the bucket. Your area, Zhenjiang, is in a key area and has a rich populace. Recently, Xiao Junfu, Zheng Hongzhang, Wang Guangyu, and others living at No. 35 Minguo Chun Lane have sent a letter expressing their enthusiasm for raising funds for the Volunteer Army. We have replied to express our welcome. However, this matter is of great importance, and individual fundraising is unlikely to be very effective. We have no prior relationship with Xiao Yangxu and others, and we are not sure how to proceed. We have always admired your association as the backbone of all sectors and your enthusiasm for national affairs. You must have a deep understanding of the need to support the Volunteer Army and recover lost territory. We are sending a special letter to ask you to strongly advocate and encourage the people of the whole town so that it can be extended to the whole province to jointly provide practical support. If you can make a call to action, we will see a response from all over the world. We look forward to your resonance. Sincerely, we hope you will take this into consideration and reply."</p>

<h3 id="e124">Various Groups Welcomed He Minhun Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>He Minhun, chairman of the Rehe Anti-Japanese Military Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 19th. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Zhu Lin and others initiated a welcome meeting at Chongshi School. Dozens of representatives from various groups attended the meeting. First, Zhu Lin delivered a welcome speech, saying: "Today we are holding a meeting to welcome Mr. He, the leader of the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. This reminds us that China is suffering from the oppression of imperialism, and recently Japan has attacked Rehe. Rehe is the gateway to Pingjin. If Rehe falls, China will be destroyed. Fortunately, Mr. He has the conscience and righteous indignation to awaken our people and lead us to work on the front line of the anti-Japanese war. Then, China will not be destroyed. Therefore, today we welcome Mr. He to express our warm sympathy and our determination to resist Japan. As for the real situation in the Northeast, we would like to ask Mr. He to report." Then, Mr. He elaborated on (1) the process of Japan's coveting of Rehe, (2) the situation and plan of the organization of the Volunteer Army, and (3) the recent war situation at the front. He said that there should be a comprehensive calculation of assistance to the Volunteer Army, and that ammunition and rations should be provided to the real anti-Japanese Volunteer Army on the front line. For example, the 120,000 Volunteer Army in Rehe, who are risking their lives, not only lack ammunition but also have no winter clothes to wear. If the compatriots in the interior can directly provide donations to the Volunteer Army on the front line, then Jinzhou can be recovered, and the lost territory in the three northeastern provinces can be recovered. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM after a group photo was taken.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Telegraph from Li Liejun and Others Requesting Troop Deployment to Recover Lost Territories <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Li Liejun and others telegraphed, stating: "The Japanese militarists have forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces for years. At the beginning of the incident, the authorities adopted a policy of non-resistance and begged for pity from the empty and powerless League of Nations. The League of Nations repeatedly held meetings and debated, and finally dispatched an investigation team. The team's report was signed in Beijing on September 4 this year, a full year since the Shenyang Incident. During this time, we have not heard of the government sending a single soldier out of the pass to recover lost territories. They only knew how to rely on the League of Nations, waiting for rescue from the bottom of a well. Now, the report has been repeatedly twisted and turned before being released to the world. After reading it, we cannot help but sigh at the authorities' misjudgment in relying on the League of Nations for years. To briefly discuss its content, the major purpose of this investigation team's visit to the East was to investigate the truth of the Sino-Japanese dispute. In terms of facts, the investigation team knew that the Shenyang Incident was due to a carefully prepared plan by Japan, implemented with swift and precise methods, and could not be regarded as a legitimate means of self-defense. It also knew that the establishment of the puppet organization in Manchuria was created by the Japanese military authorities, not by the free will of the local people. Japan clearly harmed China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity through unilateral military action. Its violation of the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact cannot be justified no matter how hard they try. To maintain the dignity of the above treaties, the investigation team should have suggested that the League of Nations advocate restoring the original state before the September 18 Incident last year and impose effective sanctions on Japan in accordance with Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. Instead, it suggests that a special system of government be organized in our three northeastern provinces under an advisory council, with a special police force trained by foreigners to maintain internal security. Other tax collection agencies in the three northeastern provinces should be supervised by foreigners, and the chief advisor of the central bank should be a foreigner. Our government has no right to interfere with the appointment of the so-called administrative head of the autonomous government and must hire foreign advisors with a significant proportion of Japanese. Furthermore, the prohibition of our troops from being stationed and the prohibition of boycotting Japanese goods in the treaty all contradict international treaties. If the League of Nations adopts its recommendations in the future, it will not only go against the wishes of our people but also expose its own weaknesses. The misjudgment of relying on the League of Nations has been proven. It is imperative to dispatch a large number of troops out of the pass to actively resist the Japanese army in conjunction with the volunteer army originally in the three northeastern provinces, recover lost territories, and shift the focus of various countries. Only then can there be justice in the world. We hope that our countrymen will recognize the impending catastrophe, mourn the imminent national demise, and act swiftly and unanimously. Those who openly advocate resistance but secretly plot to contain it are cutting themselves off from the people of the country, and this association vows to abandon them together with the people of the country. We telegraph this with anger and look forward to clear instructions.

The general outline has been completed, but the formal issuance will have to wait due to certain relationships. However, the Ministry of Industry is currently actively proceeding with all the necessary preliminary issues for the establishment of a steel plant in sequence and has not suspended them. Moreover, the plant site has been selected in Ma'anshan, Anhui, and construction will begin within two or three days. Therefore, the date for the formal establishment of the steel plant will be next month.</p>

<p>Commissioner of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office and Director of the Salt Affairs Administration Zhu Tingqi, after inspecting Erhuai, Zhejiang, and Shandong, learned that since the reorganization of each district, the affiliated staff have been honest, self-disciplined, and diligently serving the public. Therefore, tax revenue has been increasing daily, which is greatly appreciated. He has now come to Tianjin with General Inspector Zeng Yangfeng and will travel to Hangu, Tanggu, and other places to investigate the salt affairs situation. It is reported that the inspection revealed that the salt pans in the Lu district were the earliest built and the most complete in scale, serving as a model. However, due to the many national crises in recent years, management has been difficult. The suppression of private salt has not been rectified, and private beaches and private saltpeter are rampant. Although tax revenue has not been reduced, sales have actually decreased. He has personally instructed the Changlu salt transport officer and the inspection sub-office's managing director to cooperate and actively rectify the situation, so that private beaches can be eliminated in the future. As for private saltpeter, it requires the assistance of local officials. It is planned that when he returns to Beijing after inspecting each district, he will draft a plan and request the Minister of Finance to consult with the local officials of Hebei and Henan to order them to cooperate in the crackdown.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Grain and Oilseed Industry <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Appeals for Reduction of Northeast Soybean Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grain and Oilseed Industry Association submitted a petition to President Song Dai of the Nanjing Executive Yuan and Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "We believe that the soybeans produced in the Eastern Provinces are extremely abundant. The annual exports are substantial, and the daily needs of the people in the mainland depend on them. Historically, imports and exports have only been taxed at half the rate, which is to benefit the people. Since the abolition of the Likin tax, oil from the Eastern Provinces has been subject to an export tax of 4.5 yuan per 100 catties, and soybeans 0.9 yuan. Since the September 18 Incident last year, the violent Japanese have seized the Northeast Customs under the guise of the puppet state of [Manchukuo]. Our government does not want to take retaliatory action to avoid causing suffering to the local and mainland people, so it has not changed the usual transportation practices for its products. Now, the puppet state controlled by the violent Japanese has begun to levy import taxes on all goods traded with China. Therefore, our government had no choice but to implement a policy of closing the Northeast Customs and promulgated a method of levying taxes in other places on September 24. According to the regulations for national loans and factory-made goods, soybeans are still taxed at the usual rate. However, since the goods are exported from the place of origin, they are taxed first, and when they arrive, they are taxed again. The double taxation in different places has doubled the burden, which merchants can hardly bear in these difficult times. However, in order for the government to implement the sales ban policy, they reluctantly accept it and have nothing to say. However, it is found that the previous method lists the goods from Dalian as foreign goods, with a tax of 1.25% of the value of oil at any time, and 10% of the value of soybeans, plus the collection of supplementary relief and wharf donations and dredging donations, all as before. Taxed in this way, the rate has increased several times compared to before. While our members were still shocked, the Ministry of Finance secretly ordered the customs on the 12th of this month to suddenly change the predetermined method. All oils exported from Yingkou and Andong are also listed as foreign goods, and the tax rate is set in the same way as the goods from Dalian. The customs immediately received the order to collect the tax on the 14th. We have found that soybeans have always been taxed as domestic goods. The old tax law set the oil rate at 4.5 yuan, plus the collection of surcharges, so each basket of 350 catties paid about 1.5 yuan in tax. Now, it is listed as foreign goods, with a tax of 1.25% of the value. Based on an estimated value of 10 yuan, the tax payable is 1.2 yuan, plus the surcharges and export taxes, totaling more than 5 yuan per basket in customs silver, which is about 7 yuan in Shanghai silver. Compared to the past, it has increased by more than three times. Soybeans exported from Dalian are also taxed as foreign goods, with a tax of 10% of the value. Based on an estimated value of 3 yuan, the tax payable is 3 yuan, plus the surcharges and export taxes, totaling about 0.4 yuan in customs silver per 100 catties. Compared to the past, it has also increased by more than three times. Moreover, the change in oil taxation was not widely publicized in advance, and the order was sudden, making it impossible for merchants to plan ahead for goods already in transit, which further increased losses. This is no different from putting those who deal in soybeans in a situation of utter extinction. We believe that apart from dealing in miscellaneous grains, rice, and wheat, our members rely solely on soybeans. After the Shanghai War this year, finances are tight, and turnover is extremely difficult. In addition, the sharp drop in the market price of rice and wheat has resulted in even greater losses. Now, with the added burden of soybean taxation, the entire miscellaneous grain industry will inevitably be fundamentally shaken. If it is unfortunately impossible to maintain and continue, then the domestic sales of grain produced in the Northeast will be cut off, which will make the people in dire straits feel even more difficulty in making a living. Thinking of this, we cannot bear it. Moreover, soybean oil is a necessary seasoning, and soybeans are a staple food for the poor. Both are indispensable to daily life, but domestic production and demand are vastly different. The people rely solely on the Eastern Provinces. Now, if such a large tax rate is suddenly added, the merchants are directly affected, and the general poor who need daily necessities are indirectly burdened. At a time when agriculture and commerce are declining and people's livelihoods are deteriorating, how can our people bear it? In short, this time the government had no choice but to implement the policy of sealing off the Northeast Customs and levying taxes in other places. If it is still levied at the usual tax rate, then the people are subject to the double tax from both import and export, and based on the patriotic conscience, who would not want to reluctantly accept it? However, if it is levied excessively and taken without satiation, causing the people to suffer this unbearable pain in addition to double taxation, then forbearance is tantamount to announcing their own death sentence. We earnestly list the situation below and appeal to the esteemed director to grant a review and approval to classify soybeans exported from Andong and Yingkou uniformly as national loans and to levy taxes in other places at the usual tax rate. Although Dalian belongs to a Japanese concession, in order to be considerate of the difficulties of merchants and to consider the livelihood of the people, we also request that the handling of soybeans exported from there be approved in the same way to avoid shaking the entire grain merchant. In the telegraph, we are filled with apprehension and await your orders. Shanghai Grain and Oilseed Industry Association, Chairman of the Committee Gu Xinyi bows his head."</p>

<h3 id="e137">Representative of the Luoyang Dazhonghua Daily <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Reception for Local Journalists</p>
<p>Report on the Closure by the County Party Department</p>
<p>Request to Uphold Justice and Provide Assistance</p>
<p>The Luoyang Dazhonghua Daily, founded by Jia Xingyuan and others, was sealed by Xie Qing, a member of the County Party Department, and Tang Mingzhi, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, along with the security team and police team on the fifth of this month. The newspaper's president, Jia Xingyuan, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday, and at 6 p.m. yesterday, he hosted local journalists at the Nanjing Hotel on Nanjing Road. More than ten reporters from various newspapers attended. During the meeting, the chairman reported on the closure of the newspaper and requested that justice be upheld and assistance provided, and that telegrams be sent to the Henan Provincial Party Department, the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and the Provincial Government, to handle the matter impartially and order the lifting of the seal. The declaration of the newspaper is transcribed below: "Considering that during the brutal Japanese invasion, the capital was moved and Luoyang became the central hub of the Party and the State, the local area gradually prospered. In order to promote open-mindedness and public opinion, we specially founded the Dazhonghua Daily with a few like-minded comrades. Since its publication, it has been praised by society and has developed considerably. Just as we were planning to gradually expand, on the fifth of this month, Xie Qing, a member of the County Party Department, and Tang Mingzhi, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, led fifty or sixty members of the security brigade and police team, fully armed, as if facing a formidable enemy, surrounded the newspaper office, and looted everything. They also fabricated instructions to arrest the president and vice president. Xingyuan, fortunately, received information ten minutes in advance and managed to escape. Xie Qing and others fabricated evidence and falsely reported 'reactionary' activities after the fact. Such destruction of public opinion and oppression of the people not only violates the central government's repeated public announcements guaranteeing the people's freedom of assembly, association, speech, publication, and residence, but also disregards the law, acts arbitrarily, and not only has our newspaper suffered, but this sets a terrible precedent, which is a major crisis for the future of our press. Therefore, we have specially come to Shanghai to report the incident, and humbly request the gentlemen of the press to provide assistance so that we can punish these villains and resume publication. We are extremely anxious. We respectfully submit the actual reasons for the closure and the clear evidence that there is no reactionary activity, as listed below for your scrutiny."</p>
<p>Actual Reasons for the Closure: (1) Luoyang has another newspaper, the Heluo Daily, which is subsidized by the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government. Because Xie Qing is in charge, he has repeatedly requested a merger, seeing the development of our newspaper, but Xingyuan firmly refused, so Xie bore a grudge. (2) Xie Qing's behavior is despicable, and our colleagues are unwilling to associate with him. Huang Zhuangfei, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and Tang Mingzhi, the chief inspector, are corrupt and pervert the law, and our newspaper often exposes them, so they hate us to the bone. (3) Recently, as our newspaper has become more and more developed, we are preparing to expand, and they are deeply afraid that the Heluo Daily will be eclipsed, so they have devised a wicked plan to overthrow us. (4) Before the incident, because Xie Qing usually violated the law, various public organizations in the county accused him to the Provincial Party Department, and our newspaper's vice president, Zhao Ziyun, went to the province as a representative, which Xie Qing found out about, so he took his anger out on us. It is now heard that Xie Qing will be removed from his post because of this accusation. (5) Xingyuan is outspoken about Xie Qing, Huang Zhuangfei, and others' actions, so they have never been on good terms with Xingyuan.</p>
<p>Evidence Against the False Accusation of Being Reactionary: (1) Since our newspaper began publishing, it has sent twenty copies to the Central Party Department and fifteen copies to the National Government every day. For several months, the Central Party Department and the National Government have not made any criticisms of our newspaper's comments. (2) Xingyuan and Vice Presidents Guo Zibin and Zhao Ziyun, etc., have either been loyal to the Party and the State or have served their hometowns, and have never engaged in any reactionary activities. (3) If Xingyuan and others had engaged in reactionary activities, the local garrison would naturally have investigated and reported them at any time. Why does the garrison have no doubts about Xingyuan and others? (4) Xie Qing, Huang Zhuangfei, and others fabricated reactionary evidence. The day after the newspaper office was closed, County Magistrate Xie Suian had already stated that he did not recognize it. When the closure was carried out, the county magistrate asked if there was any reactionary evidence, and the Public Security Bureau reported that there was none. Moreover, the county magistrate reported to the province only that the Dazhonghua Daily had been sealed, without mentioning any "reactionary" words, which can be verified. (5) After our newspaper was sealed, local groups and elders of the entire county sent telegrams to the Pacification Commissioner's Office, the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, and the Department of Civil Affairs, guaranteeing that Xingyuan and others had not engaged in any reactionary activities. Summarizing the above two items of more than ten points, it is clear that Xie Qing and Huang Zhuangfei, etc., are maliciously accusing us and abusing their power for personal gain. Furthermore, in a central location of the capital, the closure of a newspaper should require an order from the highest authority. How could Xie Qing, a member of a county party department, be so arbitrary and act as he pleases? If he is not strictly investigated, a bad precedent will be set, and the future of our press will be in great danger. We hereby report this in detail, respectfully requesting that justice be upheld, that telegrams be sent to the Henan Provincial Party Department, the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and the Provincial Government, to handle the matter impartially and order the lifting of the seal. We are immeasurably hopeful. Jia Xingyuan, President of the Luoyang Dazhonghua Daily; Zhao Ziyun, Vice President.</p>

<p>Tranquility Returned in the Evening, Police Officers Withdrawn</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau received a report yesterday that unemployed workers were about to take action. As a precaution, security was tightened yesterday, but there were no disturbances.</p>
<p>Temporary Alert: Wen Hongen, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, received a report that, as a precaution, he specially notified the police stations in Nanshi Districts 1 and 2 and Zhabei Districts 4 and 5 to tighten security yesterday. After receiving the order, the district chiefs immediately increased the number of double posts on major roads. In Nanshi, places such as Xiaodongmen, Ximen, and Laobeimen, and in Zhabei, places such as Baoshan Road and Hengfeng Road, the police brigade, as well as inspectors, detectives, and female inspectors, also set out to patrol, with Xiaodongmen having the strictest security.</p>
<p>Tranquil as Usual: The police authorities of the French Concession and the Public Concession, seeing that the Chinese area had tightened security, specially increased the number of detectives stationed at the border between the Chinese and Concession areas. However, Nanshi and Zhabei were both tranquil as usual last night, and there were no incidents such as marching in groups. Therefore, the police officers who had been temporarily dispatched to various locations were all withdrawn.</p>

<p>Arrangements Completed, Electrification Expected Soon</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, due to the many mountains and ravines in Guizhou, the closed-mindedness of the people, and the inconvenience of transportation, specially ordered the International Telecommunications Bureau to establish a wireless radio station in Guiyang, the capital of the province. In the winter of last year, the former director, Mr. Lu Guixiang, planned everything. It is now learned that the wireless radio station there has been set up, and all the equipment has been successively transported for assembly, and electrification is expected soon.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Order from the Marine Administration Bureau for the Marine Engineers Association to Investigate the Nationality of Crew Members <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>To Find Ways to Settle the Unemployed</p>
<p>Since moving to its new address on Xinwen River, the Chinese Marine Engineers Association has been actively organizing its affairs and making every effort to provide relief measures, given the current shortage of maritime talent. Recently, the Shanghai Marine Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications ordered the association to investigate the nationality of crew members on various ships in order to thoroughly provide relief. The original text is recorded as follows: "For notification purposes, according to Instruction No. 2789 of the Ministry of Communications, in order to order the matter, the nationality of the crew members hired by the national shipping companies has never been reported to the Ministry, so it is impossible to know how many of the crew members currently used on various ships are Chinese and how many are foreign, which greatly hinders the statistics of crew members. It is necessary to investigate in detail in order to audit. In addition, the regulations on crew member certificates stipulate that those who have not obtained certificates shall not be allowed to serve as crew members. It is found that crew members in various regions often obtain certificates only after taking office, or they are rejected by shipping companies and still hire them because their salaries are lower, and continue to serve. It is necessary to strictly ban this practice, which treats navigation as a game, in order to ensure safety. As for crew members who have obtained certificates but are unemployed, this is inevitable. Given the current shortage of maritime personnel, it would be a pity to let them remain idle or change careers. A detailed investigation should be conducted in order to find ways to settle them. It is ordered that the above-mentioned items be investigated and reported separately in order to make overall arrangements and facilitate investigation. This order is hereby given. In addition to the separate investigation forms for foreign crew members, one copy of each, the association is ordered to investigate and fill out the forms in detail according to the above-mentioned items and send them to the Bureau for verification and forwarding. This notification is hereby given."</p>
<h3 id="e141">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks Shanghai County <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>To Investigate and Prohibit Rice Boats from Being Intercepted</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai County Government yesterday, stating: "Sir, on the 21st of this month, we received a letter from the Bean and Rice Trade Association stating that they had read in the economic news column of the Xinwen Bao on the 18th of this month that the source of rice in the Shanghai South Rice Market yesterday was almost zero, and it was rumored that it was caused by a certain gang of boat owners stopping rice boats in the inland river. At the same time, according to news from boatmen, the Lianyi Association of Shanghai South rice merchants, gathered by the Tongli gang, has dispatched more than 30 accomplices since the 17th of this month to intercept rice shipments at the Zhoupu Tangkou, forcibly blocking a large number of rice boats heading to Shanghai and empty boats returning from Shanghai, etc. The Lianyi Association often uses the excuse of heavy bushels to cause trouble for the Hushi hired by our association members. According to previous reports, it seems that they intend to escalate the situation in order to shift the blame. However, the food supply in this city relies entirely on the supply from rice-producing areas, and the daily demand is huge. If the above news is indeed accurate, the source will be cut off and there will be no way to continue, and panic will be seen immediately. The consequences are unimaginable. We humbly believe that our association members are bearing the aftermath of the turmoil, and at this time of financial drought, they are all indifferent to their business. Therefore, although their actions do their best to hinder, they do not have much gain or loss in the business prospects of our association members. However, it is worrying that the food in this city will cause panic and endanger public security. We ask for your attention and specially ask the Shanghai County Government to thoroughly investigate the matter. If the association does have the situation of intercepting rice boats, they should be severely arrested and punished to deter evil-doers, so that rice boats can come and go freely, and the food supply can be maintained and hidden dangers eliminated." The Lianyi Association of Shanghai South Rice Merchants, if it is indeed the case that rice boats are intercepted from entering Shanghai as reported, will affect the people's food supply to a great extent. In order to maintain the source of food in the area, it is appropriate to send a letter to your government to send personnel to investigate in detail. If the report is indeed accurate, it is intended to strictly prohibit it, so that the source of rice will not be lacking, and the public interest will be truly served.</p>

<p>The Provincial Department Approved Immediate Correction</p>
<p>The Loaned Ship's Cargo Was Also Allowed to Be Released After Verification</p>
<p>The fresh pig industry colleagues from various counties in Jiangsu, in order to oppose the illegal interception and collection of road pig tax by the business tax bureaus of Jingru, Tai, and other counties in Jiangbei, sent representatives Xin Wenyao, Wang Sheng, Gu Baoxiang, Pan Zhiwen, Chen Quanrong, Wu Xishan, Li Zhencai, and Secretary Zhu Yiyan, etc., to Beijing and the province to petition. They took the 11 pm express train to the North Station the night before last and arrived in Zhenjiang at about 6 am the next morning. They got off the bus to find a residence and rested briefly, then presented their case to Chairman Gu of the Provincial Government. Chief He of the Second Section was assigned to receive them. The representatives stated their intentions and submitted various illegal documents for inspection. After careful review by Chief He, he said that the pig tax did not comply with the regulations and that he would quickly order the Finance Department to investigate and stop it. Then they withdrew to the Finance Department, where Director Yang of the business tax office came out to receive them. He said that the Jingru and Tai counties' business tax bureaus' establishment of checkpoints in the port to intercept and collect pig tax was indeed inappropriate and should be corrected immediately, and that he had already approved the association's case. The representatives requested the speedy release of the seized ship's cargo, and he agreed to forward it to the Director for verification and release.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Tax Exemption Meeting of the Fisheries Industry Is Scheduled to Open <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>

This has been going on for a long time. The authorities have not responded to the various matters stated by the fisheries groups. In order to protect the fisheries industry, the association has decided to convene a meeting of various members on the 25th of this month. It is heard that fisheries groups from various outer ports have successively sent representatives to participate in the discussion of coping methods, and will unanimously strive for the goal until it is achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Muslims Hosted the Press Yesterday <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Islamic Mosque Federation held a symposium at the Islamic Society to host reporters because the Shanghai Beixin Bookstore published a book called [Little Pig Bajie] and drew pictures on the cover, publicly insulting Islam. First, Chairman Ha Shaofu delivered a speech, saying that the Federation has decided to seek a fair solution through legal means and asked the press for assistance. Then Ma Tianying, Wang Qingyu, and others successively explained the general idea, saying that Beixin Bookstore refers to Pig Bajie as the ancestor of Muslims, which is the worst slander of Islam. Therefore, the various Islamic mosques in Shanghai have a federation to negotiate with Beixin according to law. Islam prohibits the consumption of pigs, wine, blood, those who die from natural causes, and ferocious birds and beasts that are not ruminants, as well as animals that may be harmful to hygiene and morality. Anyone who has studied Islam knows this. However, one or two reckless people, only for the sake of manuscript fees, or for other purposes, use the fact that Muslims do not eat pork to point to Muslims as the descendants of pigs, and then attach the Journey to the West to do their best to insult Islam. Those who understand the truth recognize that this publication is of no value, but the impact of this book cannot be ignored. This book is a children's reading material. In the pure thinking of children, the wrong concept of pigs as the ancestors of Muslims has existed since childhood, forming a psychology of contempt for Islam, leading to future disputes between Muslims and non-Muslims. Non-Muslims without permanent positions laugh at Muslims based on this kind of false statement, which is even easier to cause conflict. The author said that this article is [intentionally defaming Muslims in anti-Islamic education], but deliberately disclosed it, and said [for dissemination], which is obviously intentional insult. At this time, when the country is in urgent need and we are jointly resisting foreign aggression, how can there be such an absurd publication that can create serious civil disputes? Therefore, we have decided to file a lawsuit according to law to ban its publication and impose appropriate punishment on the author and publisher. We also ask the press to provide guidance. Then, tea and refreshments were served and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Commercial Savings Bank has been in operation for more than a year since it opened last year. The shareholders' meeting of the bank for the 21st year should have been held this spring, but due to the sudden outbreak of the Shanghai Incident and the fact that the five-story building at the corner of Shilu Sanmalu was not yet completed, the board of directors decided to postpone it to October 23rd. Yesterday was the date for the bank's shareholders' meeting, which was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. At about 2 pm, all the directors, Wang Yansong, Lu Zhengbing, Jiang Linshu, Zhang Danru, Hu Xisheng, Pan Gongzhan, Pei Yunqing, Feng Zhongqing, Chen Ziming, Shen Qinzai, Yu Guozhen, supervisors Xu Jiqing, Cheng Yongliu, Jin Jianqing, and shareholders Du Yuesheng, Wu Zhihao, Yan E'sheng, Chen Songyuan, Ma Shaoquan, Ye Jiaxing, Cao Zhixiang, Zhu Xinru, Shen Ji'en, and more than 100 others, totaling 2,422 shares, or 2,188 votes, arrived.

<h3 id="e149">Chen Yinsheng Assassinated <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Received a Call from a Friend to Dine Out</p>
<p>Suddenly Shot Dead on the Spot by an Enemy</p>
<p>Chen Yinsheng, 33 years old, a native of Pudong, with the childhood name of Da Adi, lived at No. 6 Zhizhong Lane, Xixinqiao Street (also known as Baliquiao Street), French Concession. He independently opened the Jiangdong Restaurant near Xinkai River and had some savings. The furnishings in his home were magnificent and the arrangement was elegant and clean. At about 6 pm last night, Chen was tidying up trivial matters at home when he suddenly heard the telephone ringing. He picked up the receiver and listened carefully, and learned that it was his close friend Zhou Caitou who had called, inviting Chen to have dinner at the home of his friend Shen Hexun at No. 1 Shandeli, Zhaoqing Road, Fangbangqiao, French Concession. After Chen heard the phone call, he immediately dressed and left his home, and went straight to Shen's residence. However, just as Chen left his home, Chen's friend Gu Zhangsheng followed closely and asked Chen where he was going. The family replied that he had just gone to Shen Hexun's house for dinner. Gu then got up and went straight to Zhaoqing Road. However, as soon as he entered Shen's house, he was about to step upstairs when he suddenly heard four gunshots from the pavilion upstairs. Gu knew that something had happened, so he quickly retreated and ran to report to the police station. The captain immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. They only saw Chen had fallen dead in the pavilion. Upon closer inspection, he had one bullet in his chest and one in his right wrist. When they touched him, his body was already ice-cold. Further inspection of the entire house revealed that there was no one else, only heavy wooden furniture was left. Finally, ninety rounds of pistol bullets and a magazine were confiscated. The body was then transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for autopsy and reported for today's court inspection. The deceased has an elderly mother in the hall, Zhang, 61 years old, wife Ding, 30 years old, elder brother Yinfu, younger brother Miaosheng, one son and two daughters. The son's name is Baoyuan, 8 years old, the eldest daughter Baozhu, 7 years old, and the youngest daughter Baoyan is still in infancy. As for the murderers, Zhou Caitou and Shen Hexun, it is heard that both are Chen's closest old friends. Zhou and Shen had both served as detectives in the Municipal Public Security Bureau. All the insurance policies were found by Chen on their behalf. The deceased was stout and obese and usually liked to wear Western clothes. Yesterday, he suddenly changed into a woolen flannel casual suit and a small melon-skin hat. He was usually amiable and kind to others. The reporter lived opposite him and had met him once. As for the reasons for the murder, there are various rumors, and it is difficult to understand for a while.</p>

<p>Xu Hongbao, 33 years old, a native of Yangzhou who lived at No. 13 Huade Road, was previously found by Pan Hongshou, a detective from the Kunshan Public Security Bureau, to have committed a kidnapping case in Kunshan in June of this year. He came to the Linlu Police Station in Shanghai and asked for assistance in the arrest. Captain Huang Yufu secretly went to the address and arrested Xu and handed him over to the First Special District Court. He denied the allegations during interrogation and the case was filed for investigation. Yesterday, Judge Shen Bingrong came to the Third Criminal Court to continue the interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, stated the previous situation. Then, Detective Pan Hongshou reported that there were now accomplices in the case who had arrived in court from Zhonglian and could prove the facts. According to the report, he claimed to be a native of Wuling, Jiangbei, who previously lived in Zhoujiaqiao, Hongkou, and worked as a tanner. He knew the defendant. At the beginning of May, Yi and Wu went to Kunshan to do business. At that time, there were more than 80 people in total, divided into three gangs: one local, one Anhui, and one Jiangbei. The defendant was the leader of the Jiangbei gang. They all dressed up as soldiers, policemen, etc. When they arrived in Lujiaqiao Township outside Daximen, Kunshan, they kidnapped two households: one Wang family, one man and one woman, and two Zhou families, one old man, one woman, and one child, for a total of five people. Later, the hostages were released after the ransom was paid. He did not know how much the ransom was. When questioned by the defendant, he completely denied it and said that he did not know the witness at all. Shen only declared that the witness had already reported in detail and there was no need to quibble. He then ordered Xu Hongbao to be handed over to the investigators of the Kunshan County Government to be taken back for trial.</p>

<h3 id="e152">The Tianzhang Paper Mill Rent Lawsuit <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Landlord Refuses to Waive Four Months' Rent</p>
<p>When Japanese troops invaded Shanghai during the January 28th Incident, the concession boundaries were also ravaged. The Yangshupu area became an encampment zone. The Tianzhang Paper Mill, located there, had its water source cut off. Only after the Japanese troops fully retreated did things return to normal. Consequently, the mill requested the landlord, Jardine Matheson, to waive four months' rent. Jardine Matheson refused and filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, stating that according to the lease agreement, the annual rent was 15,000 taels, payable quarterly in advance. From November of last year to this month, rent arrears had accumulated for a year, requesting the court to order payment, etc. After the trial concluded, the court ruled to waive two months' rent, with the remaining arrears to be paid by the defendant. Tianzhang, dissatisfied, hired a lawyer to appeal to the Second Branch Court, requesting a four-month rent waiver, and a 50% reduction in rent for the four months from April to July. The day before yesterday afternoon, the Second High Court opened a hearing and summoned Jardine Matheson, who also hired lawyer Chen Zhongyin to represent them. They claimed that the appellant was deliberately delaying payment, as the first rent payment, according to the lease, was due on November 1st of last year, before the outbreak of hostilities. They had been in arrears for a year, owing 15,000 taels. The original judgment waived two months, leaving 12,500 taels still owed. Since they were now requesting a four-month waiver, the dispute was only over two months' rent, while they naturally acknowledged the remaining 14,000. As they still haven't paid, the appellee now, in addition to applying for enforcement, is also appealing to terminate the lease. Judge Hu then advised both parties to reconcile outside the court. If reconciliation fails, the verdict will be announced on the afternoon of the 31st of this month.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government, upon provincial order, will collect land survey expenses under the land tax item this year, at a rate of one dime per mu. The County Government immediately ordered the Finance Bureau to implement the collection. Subsequently, the Bureau reported that the first term of land value tax (busy silver) has already begun collection, and it's too late to collect the land survey fee. They requested to collect it starting with the second term land value tax (winter grain tax). The County Government reported this to the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department and received approval. However, the Property Management Committee must be organized and established first. The County Government has already instructed the Finance Bureau to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Dismissed Chinese Constable Convicted of Fraud <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhang Jinbao from Anhui, formerly Constable No. 2032 at the Zhabei Police Station, was dismissed for negligence. He became increasingly depraved, engaging in fraud. On the 10th of this month, he suddenly went to No. 606 Xinzha Road to visit his friend Su Jinrong, falsely claiming that the General Police Station wanted to hire a shop clerk, and he could recommend him, but it would require a 50 yuan "activity fee." Su, currently unemployed, was overjoyed and willing to spend 50 yuan to obtain this job. However, he insisted on paying the money after the job was secured. Zhang then accompanied Su to the General Police Station, telling Su to wait outside while he confidently entered. He quickly returned, saying the matter had been settled and he would take him to the Gordon Road Police Station to collect his uniform. Upon arriving there, he again told Su to wait outside while he went inside alone. He then emerged and told Su that the interpreter Pan, who was in charge of uniforms, was not present. He suggested that Su hand over the 50 yuan, which could be collected later. Su refused, leading to a verbal dispute. Zhang then angrily hired a rickshaw and sped away. He went directly to Su's home, but Su had not yet returned. He feigned to Su's wife that her husband's matter had been settled. Su's wife, unaware of the deception, thanked him profusely. Zhang seized the opportunity to invite Su's wife to eat at the Shenfangzhai noodle shop near Chibang Bridge. While there, he boasted about his efforts and, without waiting for Su's wife's permission, ordered cigarettes and other items from the waiter, claiming they were gifts. He then took the items and left. The noodle shop later demanded over ten yuan from Su's wife for the meal and advance payments for goods. Because Su's wife had no money to pay, they suspected a scam and reported it to the police, who detained Su's wife and fined her ten yuan. Zhang, emboldened, went to Yuan Genlin's house at No. 203 An'nan Road on the 14th, intending to repeat the scam. However, Yuan was alert and immediately saw through his deception. He reported it to the police, who dispatched detectives and apprehended Zhang. The day before yesterday, he was sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Wu Zhen presided over the interrogation. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested a severe sentence for the defendant's repeated fraud. As a result, Judge Wu sentenced him to six months imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<p>A shop house at No. 485 Malong Road in the French Concession caught fire at around 3:40 PM yesterday. Fierce flames soared, piercing the roof. The fire quickly spread to the neighboring house at No. 487, which was also consumed. A young woman, Zhang Songshi, 34 years old, was severely burned on her hair and face while trying to escape the intense fire. She was sent to the hospital for treatment. The most tragic event was that her seven-month-old baby could not be rescued and was burned to death. The fire brigade arrived with pump trucks and worked hard to extinguish the fire, which was finally put out around 5:00 PM. Two shop houses were destroyed. The fire starter, Shen Jinrong, was detained by the police and taken to the Lujiawan General Police Station for investigation.</p>

<p>Remaining Thieves Detained for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Western Detective Bao Tai, Detective Shao Jingfan, and Detective Zhao Fuhai from the Xinzha Police Station previously arrested a large number of gang members Wang Liutao, Wang Zisheng, Ding Fubao, Zhang Bingsheng, and other men and women, eighteen in total, at No. 2 Tianxi Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao and Room 302 of the Zhongnan Hotel. They also found four pistols and twenty-nine bullets under the floorboards of Ding's house. The details of their delivery to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention have been recorded previously. On the morning of the day before yesterday, Judge Ge Sixun continued the interrogation in the Second Criminal Court. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang, Jiang Yiping, Xuan Zhendong, Li Fengshen, and Chai Junying to represent them. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang rose to state the case, saying that because there were many defendants and limited time, the police had not been able to conduct a detailed investigation of each one. They had only determined that Zhang Bingsheng, Weng Yixing, Gao Fugen, Cheng Derun, Zhao Xuechu, and Tan Wenbing had no connection to the case and requested their immediate release. The remaining defendants had not yet been cleared, and they requested permission to detain them for another week or two. If they were found to be unrelated during the extended detention, they would immediately request their release. The defendants' lawyers requested bail to avoid wrongful detention. Judge Ge reviewed the confessions and ordered that all defendants be detained for further interrogation at a later date. Zhang Bingsheng and the other six were allowed to be released first.</p>

Five or sixty bodies have been recovered, but dozens are still missing. Fellow Chongming natives in Shanghai Song An, Guo Weiran, Tang Hanlin, Huang Linku, Guo Ping, Sheng Siding, Zhou Dingchang, and more than ten others met on the 21st at the Jin Chong Association on Shantou Road to discuss providing relief to the families of the victims and dealing with the aftermath. The following resolutions were made: 1. Raise funds to provide relief to the families of the victims. 2. Publicly appoint representatives Song An, Guo Ping, and Sheng Siding to go to Chongming to investigate the facts and urge the county government to severely punish the ship's crew and the manager responsible. 3. Publicly appoint members with legal expertise Guo Weiran, Gong Yiren, Song An, Guo Ping, and Huang Linyou to handle the registration of victims' families, relief efforts, and legal matters. 4. Telegraph the Central Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and other agencies, requesting orders to severely punish those responsible and the company officials. The text of the association's telegram is as follows: [To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Interior, the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Construction, the Department of Industry, the Department of Finance, and the High Court]: The Shanghai Yongyu Shipping Company's Chongming route Da Yun Steamer capsized near Baozhen port on its way from Chongming to Shanghai on October 13th, killing more than eighty people and causing losses of over 200,000 yuan. The cause of the accident was the crew's negligence and the company's monopoly for profit. The ship was carrying more than 600 packages of calico, which were piled on the upper deck, while the lower deck was empty, causing an imbalance. The sinking of the ship was avoidable. The calico was originally purchased by the Datong Yarn Factory in Shangsha and transported by small vehicles. The Da Yun Steamer's manager, seeking to seize this profit, changed the mode of transport to the steamer. There are two major steamers, Da Yun and Tianci, operating in the area. Tianci is in competition with Da Yun. The manager controlled the factory's steamers and did not allow Tianci to transport the goods. The 600 packages were loaded in one day. Otherwise, they would have been divided with Tianci, and only 300 packages would have been loaded, preventing the tragedy. Weiran and others believe that the company bears significant legal responsibility. Heavy cargo is usually loaded on the lower deck. Loading it on the upper deck, causing an imbalance, clearly foreshadowed the capsize. Maritime transport is most vulnerable to wind and rain. The ship's officers only sought profit and failed to avoid danger, leading to the tragedy. Their actions are reprehensible and deserve punishment. Weiran and others have been publicly appointed to oversee relief efforts and the aftermath, fulfilling our hometown duties. We hereby provide the cause of the accident and request your esteemed offices to send personnel to thoroughly investigate and order Chongming County Magistrate Shen Jiang to immediately arrest those responsible and the company officials for severe punishment. We are eternally grateful.</p>

<p>This newspaper previously reported that the Shanghai Dock Work Consolidation Committee's handover of new and old committee members on the 23rd of last month, at the Xiaojiuhua Temple Dock Workers' Union, led to old committee members ordering thugs to beat new committee members. Liu Defu and Xu Jianye had been hospitalized for a month due to serious injuries, but fortunately their lives were saved. However, Liu Defu's left index and middle fingers were broken, leaving him disabled. Although he still goes to the hospital for treatment daily, he was discharged from the hospital the day before yesterday. Dockworker representatives from throughout the city, in recognition of the two comrades Liu and Xu's enthusiasm for labor activism and their injury in the line of duty, launched a large-scale welcome event. A joint celebration of Liu and Xu's discharge from the hospital was held yesterday (23rd) at 11:00 AM at the Dafugui Restaurant in Dadongmen, with dozens of tables prepared to welcome them. Representatives from over 30 docks, including Zhonghua, Osaka, Dada, Wan Taixing, Taikoo, Jardine, Old Mitsui, and Kaiping, totaling over four hundred people, attended, along with forty or fifty representatives from the Party Headquarters and various labor unions. It was a grand occasion. During the banquet, Bai Xiaolan, a new member of the committee, reported on the circumstances of Liu and Xu's injuries and their hard work in serving the union and seeking benefits for workers. Zhu Xuefan, Wu Yaoting, and Chen Derong gave speeches. Liu Defu then gave a thank-you speech. After the banquet, a photograph was taken to commemorate the event.</p>

I only go to the attached factory's Song handover office every day to handle the closing and inventory matters that were handled by former director Song during his tenure.

This is not in accordance with the facts. The previous lawsuit submitted by our association listed Xu Shiying, Guan Jianfan, Xu Jiashi, Li Zhenya, and Lu Chewu as legal representatives. Because Mr. Xu and others are all standing committee members of the Anhui Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association, they were listed in order according to the usual procedures. At that time, Mr. Xu had already asked for leave to go to Lu to recover from illness and had not been informed beforehand. Later, Mr. Xu returned to Beijing and learned of the matter. Because of his position, he did not want to participate in the agency and requested to withdraw his name. Guan Jianfan and Xu Jiashi also left Shanghai due to matters and feared that it would hinder the proceedings of the lawsuit. They successively applied for withdrawal of the agency. After an emergency meeting held on October 3rd, it was resolved to approve all of them. Xu Shiying, Guan Jianfan, and Xu Jiashi should immediately revoke the agency status in this case.

<p>Council, Volume IV</p>
<p>Letter from Mr. Feetham to the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I respectfully submit to the Board the fourth volume, the final volume, of my report, which is the seventh section, specifically discussing various supplementary issues. I regret that so much time has passed before this volume could be submitted for your review. However, I firmly believe that the Board will understand the reasons for the delay and grant their forgiveness. In fact, since my return to South Africa, my judicial duties have been continuously heavy, and only recently have I been able to dedicate the necessary time to complete this work. Sincerely, Feetham. Sent from South Africa, January 6, 1932.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Section VII: Supplementary Matters <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Chapter 1: Reforms to the Proposed Board of Directors' Procedures and the Development of the Committee System</p>
<p>1.  In the fifth section of this report, there is a recommendation regarding various reform plans, which states that the Board of Directors should be expanded, with a minimum of twenty-two directors and a maximum of no more than thirty. (Note 1) If this recommendation is implemented, I believe that the Board's procedures should be revised in certain aspects to adopt a procedure that is more suitable for the needs of a larger group. However, even if there is no increase in the number of directors, there are aspects of the current procedures that should be reformed, which I would like to propose for consideration.</p>
<p>2.  By "procedures," I do not only mean the practical methods used by the Board of Directors to handle affairs during meetings. I use this term to encompass the methods used by the Board to make decisions and to put those decisions into effect. In other words, the various methods used by the Board to keep its affairs well-organized and to fulfill all the responsibilities of a body responsible for governing the Public Concession, and to control a large-scale administrative organization, which is composed of various departments directed by key personnel to handle municipal affairs, and which can be used to achieve administrative goals.</p>
<p>3.  The Board of Directors currently has fourteen directors, nine foreign and five Chinese. According to the Land Regulations passed in 1869, the number of directors should be "no more than nine and no fewer than five" (Article 10), and "three directors present shall constitute a quorum" (Article 22). However, due to the addition of three Chinese directors, which was passed by the Ratepayers' Meeting in 1926 and first implemented in April 1928, the number of directors increased to twelve. In May 1930, another proposal was passed, approving the addition of two more Chinese directors, bringing the total number of directors to fourteen, which is the current number. Although Article 22 of the Land Regulations, which states that a quorum is met with three directors present, has not been repealed, the current rules of the Board of Directors stipulate that a quorum is met with nine directors present. (Note 2)</p>
<p>4.  It is important to remember that the Board's current procedures were developed through experience to meet the needs of a group that, for most of its history, never exceeded nine members. The procedures usually followed by the Board meetings can be described as the informal procedures of a small executive body, the advantage of which lies in its freedom and simplicity. If circumstances are favorable, it can handle a large amount of business in a short period with the simplest of procedures. However, it is quite obvious that the methods currently followed, apart from any other criticisms that may be raised, are probably inadequate to meet the needs of a group composed of twenty or more people, because if one seeks a reasonable economy of time while wanting to give each director ample opportunity to express his views, then the debates of more than twenty directors must inevitably take on a more formal nature.</p>
<p>A. Benefits of the Committee System</p>
<p>5.  I believe there is a fairly reliable rule: the larger the administrative body, the more it must be prepared to delegate its work to committees in order to maintain its efficiency. Smaller committees can thoroughly study the details of various issues, and can make final decisions on less important issues. When there are various issues for which it is not authorized to make a final decision, it can prepare detailed reports, along with specific recommendations on how to handle them, and submit them to the larger, aforementioned administrative body.</p>
<p>This rule is especially applicable to a body such as the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, because in addition to the ordinary administrative problems involved in supervising a large organization, the Board often faces various difficult policy issues, and therefore cannot dedicate most of its time to paying attention to the detailed situations of the various offices.</p>
<p>6.  Regarding any reforms to the proposed procedures of the Board of Directors, I believe that the main issue to be considered is the committee system. This issue involves considering the following points: (1) How should the Board's work be distributed among the various committees? What should be the limits of the power delegated to each committee? (2) What should be the relationship between the various committees and the heads of the various departments? (3) What should be the procedures and nature of the reports submitted by the committees to the Board? What procedures should be followed when the Board meetings discuss the reports of the committees?</p>
<p>7.  The fifth section of this report mentioned the extent to which the committee system is currently used in handling the affairs of the Board of Directors (Note 3), and made several recommendations regarding certain reforms that seem appropriate. (Note 4)</p>
<p>8.  In the sections mentioned above, it was stated that "the full benefits of the committee system cannot be obtained under the current system." (Note 5) It would be very convenient to briefly consider the main benefits that can be expected from the full development of the committee system, and the current limitations on enjoying these benefits.</p>
<p>9.  The committee system, as usually applied to municipal government work, means that all the work of the city council is undertaken by its council members in groups, with each group being a committee. This arrangement allows for full supervision and control over the administration of the various parts of the city government, while also allowing a large portion of the trivial matters, which can be well managed by a smaller committee, to be handled without the need for the entire city council to handle them.</p>
<p>10. If the committee system is implemented effectively, its main benefits can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Division of Labor: This approach saves the time of the entire Board of Directors, while enabling the Board to maintain full supervision and control over its administrative agencies through the various committees. As committee members often consult with each other and with the heads of the relevant departments, they gain special opportunities to become familiar with the affairs of the Municipal Council in the areas they oversee.</p>
<p>(2) Speedy Handling: Matters that the committees have the authority to make final decisions on can be implemented immediately without waiting for the Board's approval. (3) All important matters, most notably issues regarding large expenditures or general policies, can receive more complete and thorough consideration after being initially reviewed by the committee before being submitted to the Board. Therefore, matters that require the Board's decision are considered at least twice before a final decision is made - first by the committee and then by the Board. The regular convening of the Board to address the issues raised in the committee reports provides a valuable safeguard for the Board's decisions, avoiding the danger of decisions being based on insufficient facts, or without thorough consideration, or with unclear wording. And the committee's report can be prepared in such a way as to focus the Board's attention on matters of principle, without spending too much time discussing unimportant details.</p>
<p>11. Under normal circumstances, there is an important distinction between the discussions of a committee and the discussions of the Board of Directors: committee meetings are not open to the public, while Board meetings are open to the public, and the proceedings of the meetings are published in the newspapers. However, there is no such distinction in Shanghai. Because of special circumstances in Shanghai, although short formal reports of the proceedings of both the Board meetings and the committee meetings are published by the newspapers, the meetings are not open to the public.

<p>Gold Market Advances Lightly Last Week</p>
<p>Last week, the trend of gold futures was steady, gradually rising, advancing daily without turning back, but without excessive volatility, with daily differences of only three or four taels. Initially, the silver market was nearing backwardation, and U.S. silver also fell, so the opening was high at 728.8 taels. However, the lowest price of the day was 727.4 taels. Afterwards, it frequently rose, already breaking through 30 taels. However, the overseas silver market saw little change, so the price of gold was also slightly volatile. The exchange rate suddenly plummeted, causing the local exchange market to deviate. Sterling and the U.S. dollar rose, with traders closing positions far from the market, tending towards selling. By Friday, it suddenly broke out of its silence, again showing a lively scene, as the Cantonese banks Hengxing and Yifeng fiercely resisted short positions. Various short sellers also rushed to buy, pushing both sides to close U.S. dollar positions, and the price of gold abruptly broke through the 40-tael mark. However, with profitable arbitrage opportunities available, and many taking the opportunity to sell, and with banks willing to sell, and the exchange rate rising again, and bills of exchange not being too tight, the extent of the gold price rise was not rapid. Although the silver market fell on the weekend, it was unaffected. The morning was flat, but later Hengxing added purchases, and others followed suit, reaching a high price of 745.1 taels (a weekly increase of 17.6 taels), with a high-low difference of 17.7 taels. As a result, the 44.2 taels continued to rise 17.6 taels compared to the previous Saturday (the difference between the opening and closing prices was an increase of 15.4 taels). There were still quite a few of the November contracts that had not been closed. At the beginning of the week, it had been done at (long positions paying) within 3 taels, but later it was raised to 5.75 taels, because short positions were quickly being closed, and long positions were increasing because of a shortage of cash loans, hence the increase. The volume of December contracts was estimated to be only within 20,000. The Cantonese bank Hengxing has shifted from short to long, now approximately 6,000 more long positions. Overseas silver prices were flat for sterling and falling for U.S. silver. The exchange rate fell by 4.5 points for sterling against the U.S. dollar, and by 4.625 points for the U.S. dollar against sterling, a decline for six consecutive weeks. The HSBC exchange rate was flat for sterling gold and reduced by 0.375 for U.S. dollars during the week, while the internal rate was reduced by 0.0625 to 0.125 for sterling and reduced by 0.5 yuan to 5.625 for U.S. dollars. The closing of swap positions was calculated at 1.25 for sterling and 1.875 for U.S. dollars for this month and January. Chinese gold trading firms initially took short positions and then covered, with the arbitrage price initially far and then approaching, so there was covering and resale of gold futures. According to the listed price, the margin was around 70 taels, and later around 60 taels. Now, the high and low prices of the silver market and exchange rate futures are listed below.</p>

<p>Bond Prices Continued to Rise by 0.3-0.4 Last Week</p>
<p>| Total Turnover of 19 Million Yuan in the Whole Week |</p>
<p>During the past week (from October 17th to 22nd), the market conditions for various bonds on the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange and futures were generally very weak in the first half of the week. The sentiment among buyers and sellers was extremely sluggish, and the benefits were significantly less than in the previous week. The turnover was only over 1.6 million on Monday and only 1.8-1.9 million on Tuesday and Wednesday. However, in the second half of the week, the prices gradually increased, and the futures trading became more active, which caused the market to suddenly become more lively and the turnover to increase significantly. The turnover was 3.7 million on Friday, and approximately 5 million each on Thursday and Saturday. The total turnover for the entire week was 19,005,000 yuan, which was an increase of 6.5 million yuan compared to the previous week. Among them, the unified salt tax, 20 Customs, Disbandment and other bonds performed better than before. The October contracts for the salt tax were 2.15 million, and the November contracts were 2,135,000 yuan. The October contracts for the unified tax were 1.65 million, and the November contracts were 1.63 million yuan. The October contracts for the Disbandment bonds were 1.19 million, and the November contracts were 1.2 million yuan. The October contracts for the 20 Customs bonds were 1.47 million, and the November contracts were 985,000 yuan. The October contracts for the 20 Customs bonds were 1,335,000 yuan, and the November contracts were 760,000 yuan. The October contracts for the 19 Customs bonds were 1.01 million, and the November contracts were 485,000 yuan. The October contracts for the 19 Benevolence bonds were 970,000, and the November contracts were 390,000. The October contracts for the Reorganization bonds were 680,000, and the November contracts were 415,000 yuan. However, other bonds were still very weak. The total turnover for customs duties was 340,000, Reorganization 6% 150,000, 96 Public Bonds 60,000 yuan, and no trading for Financial bonds. Although various bonds had spot market openings, the turnover continued to be sparse, with a total turnover of only 33,000 yuan for the entire week. As for the price changes of various bonds during the past week, the market environment was still calm and unchanged due to the depressed domestic and international situations and the lack of new developments compared to before. Therefore, the price trends of various bonds were still very peaceful, with no major fluctuations and remaining in a hovering state throughout the week. As the end of the month approached and the settlement period was getting closer, the futures trading increased, and the retail investors in the market were quite active in covering their positions, so the prices generally trended upward. According to the changes, the prices were slightly lower by about 0.2 on Monday, and increased by about 0.2 per day between Tuesday and Wednesday. The upward trend was slightly stronger on Thursday and Friday, with an increase of about 0.3-0.5 per day. However, on the last day of the week, more bonds were sold out, and the prices declined slightly. As a result, the prices were higher by about 0.4-0.5 compared to the previous week, but the spot loan for customs duties in October, the spot loan for 19 Benevolence bonds, and the November contract loans each increased by more than 1 yuan. Considering the situation of the bond market, it is still depressed, and as the settlement period is approaching, the current month will soon be closed. It is difficult to expect development for the future for the time being. The statistics of the high, low, and fluctuation prices of various bonds in the past week are listed in the following table (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>The Yarn Market Was Slightly Tighter Last Week</p>
<p>Cotton yarn trended slightly steady during the past week. After a sharp decline in market prices, a portion of profit-takers covered their positions, causing the market to rise slightly. Some of the long positions of the Wing On factory are , most closed their positions and moved from near to far contracts, showing that they were unwilling to abandon their bullish outlook. At the same time, prices were already low, and new sellers were wary. There was a relative shortage of chips in the market, so the market showed a tight situation. However, the short positions of Shenxin and Shao’s were still being released and not covered, and the fighting in Sichuan and Shandong had not yet settled, so the sentiment was still bearish, and both sides were still releasing positions. There was considerable opposition from both sides, and the prospects were uncertain. Among the foreign buyers, Shiru was more active than in the previous week, and most of the purchases were still made by the Nanbu and Chaoshan buyers. Although the fighting in Sichuan had not yet stopped, business was more active than before on the weekend. The total volume for the week was 8,685 bales, an increase of 6,719 bales compared to the previous week, and prices rose by approximately 2 taels. However, the price of Zhongsha yarn, 20s count from the Shenxin factory, was uniquely cheap in the market. The volume of yarn futures traded was 128,450 bales. The buying volume of each group is listed below.</p>

<p>The cotton market has been sluggish all week, as the overseas US and Indian cotton markets have trended downward, and the domestic Zhengxin cotton is entering the market, resulting in a bearish sentiment. Some manufacturers have sold short positions of over 200,000 piculs, and the pressure is very strong. Currently, yarn sales are sluggish and financing is extremely tight, and most people in the business community are tending toward short positions. However, although the environment is extremely bad, farmers are holding back from selling because prices are already low, so although the new cotton is on the market, the sources from various regions have not been enthusiastic. As for a certain manufacturer’s aggressive sale of approximately 50,000 piculs in October alone, now that the delivery period is approaching, there is not enough cash cotton for a very large delivery in time. The Cotton Inspection Bureau has already sampled and inspected approximately 20,000 piculs of cash cotton, and still lacks half of it. On Saturday, the Exchange again convened a council to study the delivery issue, and the details are unknown, so the standard cotton for October may still change on Monday. Judging from the overall situation of the cotton market, it will not break away from the flat and sluggish situation, but the short positions sold out are too large. The total volume of cotton futures traded in a week was 352,200 piculs. The sources on the docks included 14,203 bales of Yao cotton and 4,146 bales of Tong cotton. US cotton was down 30 points from the previous week. The amounts of spot cotton bought and sold by each manufacturer are recorded below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton prices were firm due to buying by traders, but later weakened due to favorable weather and hedging by Southern sellers. Futures prices fell by 2 to 4 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 2 to 6 points, while spot prices fell by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 6 points.

<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, arrivals were slightly fewer, and trading in the local market remained sluggish. New arrivals from Changshu and Xixi opened at a reduced price of 0.20 yuan. Kiln-grown Baige rice was sold as soon as it arrived, with no price fluctuations. Rice from Suzhou, Wujiang, and Tongli was scarce, with little to no market. Daily transactions totaled approximately 700 to 800 piculs.</p>
<p>New Zhabei: Yesterday, over 30 boats arrived from various inland regions. Trading in the market was active in the morning but slowed down in the afternoon. Old, inferior rice was sold off at nearly a foot below market price. Kiln-grown rice was sold at break-even prices, with no price changes. There were few buyers for wharf-stored Jian rice, indicating a downstream trend.</p>

<p>Recently, due to scarce arrivals, the wood market continues to tighten. Previously, Sichuan fungus arrivals had opened at 51 taels, but are now being quoted at 54 taels without any transactions. News from Hankou indicates that premium Shi fungus has risen to 43.6 taels, requiring nearly 53 taels for Shanghai delivery. However, trading in Shanghai is not particularly active, making it difficult to raise prices excessively. Yesterday, high-quality local brands of fungus were offered at 53-54 taels, while Shi fungus was sold at over 49 taels, now at 50 taels. Further price increases will depend on increased sales.</p>

<p>European and American demand is lacking; Japanese silk sales remain relentless.</p>
<p>Last week, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market continued to experience sluggish sales. The New York market remained competitive with Japanese silk. Previously, Japanese silk's inferior quality required blending with Chinese silk for weaving. Now, Japanese silk merchants are improving their reeling techniques, selecting Japanese silk with higher tensile strength for export to New York. As a result, Japanese silk exports to the U.S. are increasing, and demand for Chinese silk is declining. Currently, there are 4,000 to 5,000 bales of yellow, white, Jing, and Guangdong gray Jing silk in stock, sufficient to meet demand for over a month. Telegrams from New York to Shanghai were infrequent and prices remained low. In Lyon, winter silk orders were weak and actual sales were stagnant. In England, there were only spot transactions. Overall, there was no turnaround in spot silk sales last week. Only American and French firms replenished their inventories, with little new development. Spot silk transactions totaled less than 300 bales, while exports totaled over 400 bales. European and American Chinese silk prices appeared stable but were implicitly weakening due to exchange rate fluctuations. The following is a price list (New York prices are per pound in US dollars, Lyon prices are per kilogram in French francs):</p>
<p>Silk Type   New York   Lyon   Silk Type   New York   Lyon</p>

<p>The medium-thick serge market has weakened recently, with public sales plummeting by several coins. For example, Tianyou's No. 1000 and No. 2000 serge were sold last week at 4.10 taels per yard, but are now being sold at 3.85 taels. Genuine old brands are priced at 4.30-4.40 taels (compared to 4.75 taels last week). The reason for the price drop is large inventories and sluggish sales. The market for medium-thick serge relies entirely on Western clothing tailors, who have already placed their orders. Sales in the local market have slowed due to the influence of new-style Hanling Peng wool and the colder weather, causing holders of goods to panic and sell off at reduced prices.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Yunzhu Wool Fails to Sell <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>In the wool market, recent cold weather has unexpectedly stimulated sales, particularly for thick wool materials used for various overcoats. Yuntou wool and Zhutou wool are necessary materials for both Chinese and Western-style overcoats. They were popular in Shanghai three to four years ago, but have gradually declined in popularity and are now nearly neglected. Except for minor interest from outports, there is virtually no business. As a result, prices are very low, with ordinary brands of Zhutou wool being offered at only 2.50-2.60 taels per yard. Yuntou wool is mostly out of stock, and arrivals of Zhutou wool are also scarce. The current market is dominated by old stock and Ke Xian goods from abroad.</p>

<p>The bamboo-joint steel market has been characterized by abundant arrivals and uncertain sales, creating an impression of strength on the outside but weakness on the inside. The recent sales by foreign firms have further weakened the market and softened prices. The lowest prices are estimated at 63.5 taels per ton. In the past few days, the market has become slightly more active, and prices are showing an upward trend, estimated at 65 taels per ton. For specific sizes such as 3/8, 7/8, and 1 inch, a price of 70 taels at customs is necessary to secure supply. The reason for the price increase is twofold: high set prices and strong purchasing by speculators, and the high costs of previous orders by traders, resulting in significant losses. As a result, traders are hesitant to place new orders, leading to reduced arrivals. The market atmosphere has improved, boosting confidence and driving prices upward. According to insiders, if the construction industry in Shanghai picks up, the market outlook will improve further.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Four-Character Classes of the Petty Person's Success <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Someone once said that there are four characters symbolizing the stages of love: first, "比" (bǐ, to compare), representing the mutual inclination of the man and woman, inseparable; second, "臼" (jiù, mortar), representing the intimate embrace of the man and woman, face to face, hand in hand; third, "白" (bái, white), signifying integration, the practice of cohabitation; fourth, "北" (běi, north), representing disagreement, moving in opposite directions, with no possibility of cooperation.</p>
<p>I say: There are also four characters symbolizing the success of a petty person: explained as follows:</p>
<p>First, "傘" (sǎn, umbrella), four petty people and one ten, all under the protection of a superior; the ten is like a plus sign, resembling A+, or B+, indicating above A, above B, implying that one superior can protect more than four petty people.</p>
<p>Second, "价" (jià, price), the petty person on the right wants to climb as high as the superior on the left, but falls short, so the petty person is supported by two stilts.</p>
<p>Third, "从" (cóng, from), the petty person has climbed to stand shoulder to shoulder with the superior, indistinguishable in rank.</p>
<p>Fourth, "仌" (bīng, ice), the petty person has progressed and climbed above the superior.</p>
<p>To know the four stages of the petty person's success, just look at the four characters symbolizing it: 傘, 价, 从, 仌. [Note: 从 is the same as 從, and 仌 is the same as 冰.]</p>
<h3 id="e192">Waterfall <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Ping</p>
<p>[Chinese people, listen!]</p>
<p>I remember that after the September 18th Incident last year, a scholar of world ethnicity said the following:</p>
<p>[There is currently a large "wet cloth" (referring to the Northeast provinces). The Germans are planning how to utilize its water power, how to irrigate fields. The British are silently going there to realize the German ideas. The Japanese, however, shouted loudly, "This is our lifeline!" and frantically ran over to seize it, claiming it as their own. As for the Chinese, the owners of this waterfall, they didn't really have any use for it, only appreciating nature and using it as material for writing poetry. So, they didn't care much about the ownership, because even if it changed owners, they could still appreciate it, still write poetry.]</p>
<p>At the time, I was naturally very angry after reading it. But, calmly recalling history, I couldn't find any evidence to refute it.</p>
<p>That was still a year ago.</p>
<p>Please look at the present situation: lost territory has not been recovered, national difficulties are increasingly urgent, and the people are living in a drunken stupor. Everything is still in an extremely dangerous and pathetic state! Not only that, the aggressive ambitions and encroaching steps of the powerful enemy are becoming clearer day by day. To be honest, when the lost territory in the Northeast has not been recovered and the blood of the Shanghai war is still fresh, we cannot actively serve on the battlefield and kill the enemy outside the border. We cannot destroy our homes to relieve the national crisis and provide material assistance to the brave men of the Northeast. We are already ashamed to death! We can only intensify the boycott movement in a passive way to achieve a slight effect.</p>
<p>Writing this, my heart is extremely heavy! I don't want to say anything more. I just want everyone to reflect: What else can you do but let people slaughter you, if you are so useless, unpromising, unconscionable, and unconscious?</p>
<h3 id="e193">The Beauty of Heroism <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Xiang</p>
<p>Beauty is the source of life, a cup of fine wine in the desert, a beacon in the night, a guide in life. Without beauty, the world would die, and humans would be just a group of animals.</p>
<p>Does beauty have limits? The limits of beauty are truth and goodness. If it is not good, it is not beautiful. Similarly, as long as it is true and good, it is beautiful. The fiery sunrise is beautiful, the watery moonlight is beautiful, the turbulent Yangtze River is beautiful, the gentle stream is beautiful; the blood of martyrs is beautiful, the rouge of beautiful women is beautiful; the thrilling sound of guns and cannons is the beauty of heroism, and the melodious singing of women is the beauty of gentleness; solemnity is beautiful, and decadence is also beautiful. As long as it is true and good, it is beautiful. Quietness is beautiful, and especially, violence is beautiful!</p>
<p>At present, the world is full of the color of love. Volcanoes are erupting, the earth is shaking, rivers are boiling, and the sea is roaring. Guns and cannons have already begun to bombard us from all directions, and knives are already on our heads! All we see is hot blood, red fire, and our noses are filled with the smell of gunpowder and fishiness! The goddess of peace has gone far away! Friends, the time is getting more and more urgent, not allowing you to hesitate, not allowing you to be lazy. Which direction should you go in now? Do you still want to drink a cup of cool chrysanthemum tea? Or do you want to drink a cup of strong sorghum liquor?</p>
<p>It seems that someone once said that beauty requires rhythm and harmony. A cup of fragrant tea requires gentle and elegant sipping. If a rough man comes along, picks up the cup, and gulps down three big swigs, then there is no rhythm, no harmony is lost, and what lacks harmony and rhythm cannot be considered beautiful. Indeed, beauty requires rhythm and harmony. However, is harmony and rhythm only found in gentle expressions? General Fan sat down and cut pork to eat, how vulgar! However, that is still the greatest beauty in the world! Similarly, Emperor Gaozu of Han's "Song of the Great Wind" is rough and simple, but is still recited to this day. Saying that a cup of fine tea must be sipped slowly to be considered beautiful is something only Lin Daiyu and Jia Baoyu in "Dream of the Red Chamber" would do. I don't say that, I just love to gulp down three big swigs.</p>
<p>The reality is that we no longer have the opportunity to slowly savor that cup of fragrant tea! The pure talk of the Wei and Jin dynasties was enough to ruin the country! Friends, now we must learn from the brave men of ancient Sparta, fighting alone, dominating the world, and living that extraordinary, rough life! We must immediately abandon gentle enjoyment, shallow pursuits, low-level material desires, and a relaxed and lazy peaceful life. We must tighten the blood vessels throughout our bodies and plunge into the flames! We must put down the fragrant and soft rice and bite into the dark and hard cornbread! From now on, we must no longer be fascinated by the gentle melodies, but learn from the ancient Qin people's hitting the pottery and calling out "wu wu," and sing our heroic battle songs! We must have the heat of the sun and the surge of the Yangtze River! Only burning like fire is our only way out from now on! Friends, rise up! Rise up and open up our world of heroic beauty!</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Buying and Selling System and Speculative Nature <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Lan</p>
<p>[Such is Marriage]</p>
<p>Everything is progressing; marriage, a major life event, has also progressed from a buying and selling system to a speculative nature. In the past, parents sold their children as [machines for producing people], regardless of the consent of the parties involved, relying only on their own likes and dislikes. The seller only wanted to sell at a good price and then [would deny the debt], regardless of whether the daughter was treated well, abandoned, or abused, as if she were not their daughter at all. They would then say with feigned sympathy, [Alas! My daughter has such a thin life]. Otherwise, [a daughter who has been married off is like water that has been poured out], living is as part of the X family, dying is as a ghost of the X family.</p>
<p>The buyer only wanted the machine to be able to produce people, not caring about anything else, except for haggling over the price; as for whether they could [be happily married forever], that depended on the child's good fortune!</p>
<p>Now it seems to be progressing. The buying and selling marriages under the so-called old etiquette have been fundamentally shaken and shattered. The young masters and young ladies put on the iron helmet of [free love] and proceed in all directions.</p>
<p>But the so-called [free love] is simple enough that you can't believe it. After a trip to the park! Of course, it doesn't have to be a park! After a few conversations, they start to [regret not meeting sooner]. A week later, they start entering and exiting the doors of hotels together. When the melon is ripe and the stem falls off, they have to invite two [supporting actors] to play a comedy once. What happens after marriage? That depends on whether HEBE is always by her side, and whether he is followed by the God of Wealth.</p>
<p>Everything is progressing; marriage, a [major life event], has also progressed from a buying and selling system to a speculative nature.</p>
<p>Note: HEBE is the goddess of youth.</p>
<p>Brief News: The acupuncture physician, Mr. Fang Shen'an, has long been known for his miraculous needles. Because patients often regard needles with fear, he has deeply researched the ancient moxibustion method of our country and invented various electrotherapy devices. Mr. Fang believes that the electrotherapy of Western medicine sometimes corresponds to the principles of our country's moxibustion method. However, moxibustion scorches the skin, causing pain to the patient. Western medicine uses electrical heat without any medicine. If they can be integrated and applied, the effect will be significant. Last year, Mr. Fang's medicated electrotherapy achieved great results. The method involves using electricity to transmit heat and penetrate medicinal vapors into the skin. Since its application, the effect has been miraculous. Now, he has gone a step further and created electric acupuncture, which uses the power of electrical heat to directly reach the meridians through the needle tips, penetrating deep into the interior, with unexpectedly great effects.

<p>In addition, the brothers Shanzi and Daqian Zhang, of the Dafeng Hall, have been collecting calligraphy and paintings from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties for twenty years, which are rich and exquisite. They will be selected and exhibited at the Art Appreciation Society, No. 80 Hualong Road, from the 27th to the 31st of this month. Some of them will be available for transfer if there are appreciators, in order to broaden circulation. (Zizai)</p>

<p>— Seeking Happiness Studio Master</p>
<p>Lu Boqin was very distressed when he received the news about the postal bureau being in danger. Because even if he could safely leave the country, he would be forced to abandon his lover and go far away! The postal rights of the Republic of China in the Northeast would be lost at the same time as his lover, which was truly extremely unfortunate, and he couldn't help but be distressed. But the reality was difficult to reverse, and he definitely couldn't abandon his lover. Could he stay here alone? He had already felt that his actions were not very free these past few days, and it often seemed like a little ghost detective was watching him closely from behind. If he didn't surrender to the Japanese and willingly continue to work in the postal bureau of Manchukuo, would the Japanese let him stay here for no reason? Surrender! This was something he would rather die than do. Staying here without leaving, even if he wasn't afraid of death, he still couldn't live without money. After thinking it over, he really had no solution! So, he became anxious and thought about joining the Volunteer Army nearby. He would be able to face the country, and he wouldn't be too far from his lover. However, he still couldn't find a way to join the Volunteer Army, it was just a pipe dream.</p>
<p>During this period of ants climbing on a hot pot, he still met with Tong Yizhen many times in the open air, and they sighed in vain, but still couldn't find a good solution. However, he received strange news from Tong Yizhen that Tong Guifu had suddenly become active on his own these days, and was happily active outside; and even some sneaky Japanese people came to Tong's house, talking secretly behind closed doors, not letting Yizhen hear. He couldn't guess what wonderful medicine this uncle of his, a citizen of Manchukuo, was hiding in his gourd?</p>
<p>One day at dusk, Tong Yizhen suddenly grabbed Lu Boqin at the entrance of the alley and reported in a panic:</p>
<p>[Didn't you tell me to pay more attention to my uncle's recent strange behavior? This matter has finally been revealed today! As expected, it is very related to me. My uncle has joined the Concordia Party and has been instructed by the Japanese to organize a delegation of young girls from Manchuria to visit Japan. These young girls are not easy to find, so he recommended me! That's why the Japanese came to my house to examine my appearance. Today, the Japanese have recognized me as qualified, and came to inform me in person, and said that after returning from Japan, we young girls who have been on a mission will be treated generously and transferred to the Changchun Executive Government to become imperial consorts. The reason is that the Japanese do not agree with Emperor Puyi's recent plan to re-employ eunuchs from the old imperial palace in Beijing, so they proposed to replace them with a batch of imperial consorts. Ten young girls each will be selected from Japan, Korea, and Manchuria to fill the vacancies for imperial consorts. I was unfortunately selected by them again! When I heard this, I originally couldn't agree; but you advised me not to directly conflict with them, so I just politely declined for a while. I specifically came to you to think of a solution. But I have long known that you are indecisive. If you continue to hesitate, you will enter the pass, and I will go to Japan and then to that Executive Government in Changchun to become an imperial consort. We will be separated forever, with no hope of reunion!</p>

<h3 id="e197">Teacher Liu's Demagoguery Confounds the Masses <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Emperor Gaozu of Han did not slay the white snake to gain the world. He did not invite Zhang Zifang, who traveled with Chisongzi, to become his prime minister. He did not, like Liu Xuan'de taking Sichuan, invite Zhuge Liang, who wore a Bagua robe, held a white feather fan, and could borrow the east wind but not the west wind, to become his strategist. He did not, like Song Jiang and the thirty-six Heavenly Spirits and seventy-two Earthly Fiends running rampant on the Water Margin, invite Ru Yunlong Gongsun Sheng, who carried an ancient Song-patterned sword on his back and recited incantations, to become his military advisor. Our country's history of creating mysterious and peculiar events with ghosts and gods is mostly like this.</p>
<p>Now I see reported that the cause of this Sichuan war [is because Liu Xiang believed in heresies and listened to Liu Chongyun's demagoguery. Chongyun is skilled in Daoist arts. Liu Xiang trusts him greatly, respecting him as a teacher. All military and state affairs, as well as personal conduct, are decided by the teacher. The teacher once said that Xiang is the largest star in Sichuan, and will one day dominate one side. A few days ago, Teacher Liu fasted for seven days and seven nights, bathed and dressed in incense, ascended the stage to examine the celestial phenomena, and said that he had been allowed by Heaven to appoint Yue Wumu as the commander-in-chief and Pang Shiyuan as the chief of staff. As long as forty-nine days pass, Sichuan can be unified.] Liu Xiang listened to the teacher's nonsense and created the tragic disaster of the Two Lius in Sichuan. It is not surprising that these ambitious warlords would be elated and start a war after hearing such fantastical tales.</p>
<p>Using gods to establish teachings is our country's old trick. However, it is somewhat unwise for Heaven to appoint two gods, Yue Wumu and Pang Shiyuan, to be the commander-in-chief and chief of staff. Yue Wumu devoted himself to serving the country and obeyed the central government's call to return to the capital, but was eventually harmed by Qin Hui and did not achieve his ambition of restoring the country. Pang Shiyuan assisted Liu Xianzhu in taking Sichuan, but died from an arrow in Luofeng Slope and did not achieve great success either. Even when these two gods were alive, they did not achieve their goals. Now that Heaven has sent two gods to be Liu Xiang's commander-in-chief and chief of staff, I am afraid that these two gods will also say [We refuse to participate in internal wars and respectfully decline].</p>
<p>[Demagoguery arises from people] It is also said that [When a country is about to perish, there will be demons]. The warlords do not consider their own strength or the overall situation of the country, but listen to the demagoguery and act willfully. I think there will be some danger. The Empress Dowager Cixi of the late Qing dynasty listened to the words of the Boxers and supported Qing in destroying foreigners. Guns and cannons did not enter, and as a result, the emperor had to flee and the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing. The effect was that they were completely fooled. This is very recent historical material. If Teacher Liu really has the ability, he should invite the gods from the Investiture of the Gods or invite Sun Dasheng from Journey to the West, who can somersault 108,000 li in one jump.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday's report said that Teacher Liu went to the front line to supervise the battle, riding in a yellow sedan chair, accompanied by a teaching division and three battalions of guards. The military appearance was magnificent, and the viewers filled the road. There has been no such military honor since Tang Jiyao. This is really a monster. This is really a strange thing and very interesting.</p>

<h3 id="e200">A Method for Artificially Drying Fresh Flowers <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Quan</p>
<p>The freshness and vibrancy of most flowers usually only last for a short time before they wither, which is such a pity, isn't it? Now, there is a method where we can artificially dry fresh flowers, preserving their original freshness for a long time. This is a great invention, written below:</p>
<p>We only need to prepare a wooden box and some white sand to pick the flowers and start drying them.</p>
<p>First, spread a layer of white sand on the bottom of the box, put the flowers on the sand surface, and arrange them in the desired pose. Then, gently open the petals, slowly fill the flower with white sand, and then lightly sprinkle more white sand, burying the entire flower. Cover the box.</p>
<p>After doing this, place the sand box in a dry and warm place, noting the date. After two weeks, gently push aside the white sand in the sand box to see if there is any moisture on the petals. If not, then you have succeeded. If the petals are not yet completely dry, they must be reburied.</p>
<p>We must know that ordinary fresh flowers take about two to three weeks to dry, but it depends on the climate. If the temperature is high, the flowers will dry faster; if the temperature is low, the flowers will dry slower. This is something we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>If the petals in the sand box are completely dry, doesn't that mean it's successful? At that time, we will slowly remove the sand! It is best if the wooden boards around the box are removable so they can be taken apart at will, allowing the sand to spread out on its own. Then, take the flowers out. If there is sand or dust on the flowers, use a wool brush (soft chicken or duck feathers are also acceptable) to gently brush it off. Be especially careful at this time, because the dried petals are very fragile.</p>
<p>Now, take these dried fresh flowers and place them in a vase on the desk, and they will never wither again.</p>
<p>Finally, I must also make it clear. The flowers that are picked must be dry and whole. Those with dew or raindrops on them cannot be used. It is easy to tell whether the flowers are contaminated with dew or raindrops. Just pay attention, and you can recognize it. However, the white sand that is taken must also be very clean. If there are any impurities inside, they cannot be used either. To make the white sand very clean, there must be another procedure: washing. Although ordinary white sand looks very white, it actually contains some dust, so it must be washed. We put the white sand in a white porcelain basin and pour clear water in, stirring the sand. Then the heavy sand sinks to the bottom, and the light dust floats to the top, turning the water cloudy. Then slowly pour out the dirty water, replace it with some clean water, and repeat this exchange</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>several times until the water poured in, no matter how stirred, is no longer cloudy. Only then is the white sand considered clean. Then pour out the water, place the sand in a ventilated place to dry, and at the same time, be careful not to let dust fall into the white sand. This washed white sand can then be used with confidence.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Suggestions for Reforming the Almanac <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education's Central Observatory has compiled new almanacs every year and distributed them to government offices in various provinces. However, the government offices did not widely distribute them, so very few people knew about them. In recent years, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau has also issued a new type of almanac, making great efforts to distribute it. The compilation method is good, and the price is low, but not many people buy it. On the other hand, the Guangdong almanac and small popular almanacs are outdated, crude, and popular in society. Even the most widely sold "National Quick Guide" has many shortcomings in its content. I believe that the reform of Chinese almanacs is a good opportunity to enhance national common sense and transform outdated thinking. How can it be said to be a trivial matter and neglected? Now, I will briefly list a few reasons that urgently need reform:</p>
<p>(1) Fostering Superstition. Try to look at the Guangdong almanac used in society. Not only is the printing poor, but it is still woodcut, truly a printing from eighty years ago. The content is extremely absurd and shallow. In addition to the lunar calendar being the main thing that urgently needs reform, there are countless paradoxical records. The people are influenced by what they see and hear every day, and their thinking becomes vulgar and their knowledge immature. The failure to improve the almanac is also a major reason. For example, the book states that the Noble Spirit is in the southeast, the God of Wealth is due north, the God of Joy is northwest, and it is auspicious to increase the population, enter school, raise the beams, travel, break ground, receive wealth, bathe, sign contracts... and so on. Everything one sees promotes superstition, doesn't it? The Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches are originally a kind of pronoun used by the ancients to record time. Now, when people encounter major events such as weddings and funerals, they either ask blind fortune-tellers to calculate or consult date-selection shops. These date-selection wizards rely on the almanac. Therefore, this tattered almanac of dozens of pages is actually a secret manual for witches and sorcerers to deceive people! Also, the Spring Ox Picture is meaningless, and the Twenty-Eight Mansions are even compared to the twenty-eight famous generals during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han Dynasty, making them the divine names of the twenty-eight constellations in the sky. Furthermore, things like "Good Luck Opening the Door on New Year's Day" and "Good Luck Burning Incense on New Year's Day" are absurd, unfounded, and written in strange and vulgar language. Shouldn't they be urgently reformed?</p>
<p>(2) Other Errors. The almanac only records the times of solar and lunar eclipses and the rise and fall of tides without explaining the reasons,</p>
<p>which is also a defect. Things like [Rotten grass turns into fireflies] and [Sparrows entering the great water turn into clams] although related to the solar terms, [have already been said in the Book of Months.] However, the theories are erroneous and do not make sense in terms of animal physiology. They are truly an obstacle to science and should be urgently deleted. In addition, the birthdays of gods and Buddhas are specially commemorated, which is also laughable. I believe that national humiliation commemorations, scientific common sense, the current situation in the three northeastern provinces, surveys of domestic and foreign goods, common sense of geography and history, records of books, arithmetic, transportation, etc., should all be added. Furthermore, common sense for businessmen, family organization, personal cultivation, and common sense for social interaction should be included to provide practical use. Alas! The popular almanacs on the market today not only increase national superstition but also greatly violate the national system. Shouldn't they be urgently reformed?</p>
<p>I don't have the time to refute the errors of the popular almanacs on the market, but since the authorities have clearly ordered them to be banned, why are these almanacs still selling so well everywhere? It is truly a question! The absurd almanac of the twenty-second year is about to be published again. I wonder what measures the local authorities have in place?</p>

<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>My old friend Mr. Xiong, who works in the police force, suddenly received the terrible news of his wife's death. He was filled with grief, rubbed his eyes full of tears of blood, and hurriedly asked his superiors for leave, rushing home as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>After sadly taking care of her funeral, he suddenly thought about what to do with the three poor motherless children she left behind. Alas! He himself, driven by life, was a sojourner in a foreign land and could not stay at home for long to raise these three children who had no ability to be independent. Alas! Since the environment did not allow him to stay at home to raise them, then he would take them with him to his post. But moving the whole family would be extremely burdensome. Moreover, those who are serving in public office now are only magistrates for a short time. Today they are here, and tomorrow they are transferred there. Wouldn't it be difficult to move back and forth? It would be better to hire an honest old woman to entrust her with the responsibility of raising them, so that he could still go out to make a living. That would be the best of both worlds. Fortunately, the eldest daughter was already thirteen years old, and the youngest was also seven years old. Neither of them needed breastfeeding. The old woman's ability could also handle it. After he decided in his heart, he hurriedly went to find an old woman near sixty years old, and handed over all the matters in the family to her management in person, and solemnly instructed her to take good care of her three sisters. After he arranged the family affairs, because the vacation was over, he had no choice but to leave his three orphaned daughters with grief and tears and return to his post.</p>
<p>This old woman, after entering Mr. Xiong's family, actually took on the responsibility of raising and caring for his three children as if she were their mother. The three sisters also treated her like their own mother and were very close to her. No matter what she ordered, they obeyed her completely. A week later, the three sisters, sleeping in bed at night, suddenly heard a ghostly [shh shh shh] sound outside the room, which frightened them so much that they were dumbfounded and their hearts were trembling with fear. They hurried to burrow into the quilt, covered their ears, and closed their eyes. At daybreak, the thirteen-year-old girl told the old woman about the ghost sounds at night and asked her to find a way to protect them. The old woman said, [I have heard the ghost sounds these past two nights. I sleep in the outer room and hear them every night. It almost scared me to death. Moreover, last night a small-footed female ghost came to lift my mosquito net, scaring me to hide in the quilt and tremble!] The sisters, being young and ignorant, were terrified when they heard that a ghost had come to disturb the mosquito net. They all asked the old woman to move into the same room to sleep, and at night, they asked the old woman to sew the mosquito net door with thread. While sleeping in bed, they all burrowed tightly into the quilt, completely covering their heads!</p>
<p>This haunting incident was known to Mr. Xiong's friend, who wrote a letter to report it to him. Mr. Xiong was very puzzled when he received the letter and immediately returned. The sisters told him about the matter, but Mr. Xiong didn't quite believe it. He was a member of the police force and was very alert. He suspected that there was something fishy about this matter, so he ran to the room to check the trunks and chests. Sure enough, as he expected, he found that more than two hundred yuan of things were missing and determined that it was the old woman's trick. He immediately detained her.</p>
<p>She confessed that because the three sisters were young and easily deceived, she resorted to this trick of pretending to be a ghost to scare them into submission, hiding in the quilt, and asking her to sleep in the same room, so that she could take the opportunity to steal things.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Xiong sent a letter to the author detailing the whole incident. After reading the original letter, I was very moved and deeply lamented the deterioration of social customs, the loss of morality, the cunning and deceitful schemes, and the difficulty of reading people's hearts. If this old woman, already in her sixties, still engages in such dishonest behavior of deception and theft, it can be seen that the current society is truly declining.</p>
