<p>時評</p>
<h3>吾人所欲進言於有吉公使者梓·</h3>
<p>日本新派駐華公使有吉明君。於國聯調查團李頓爵士等離華之前一日抵上海。今日將赴京矣。此新來之公使。有其四個月前往來京滬活動之情形及昔在上海總領事任内十年之外交成績。可供國人之回憶固無待介紹而可明瞭其爲如何人物者。日本論士。認中國以蔣作賓使日日本以有吉使華爲好代表之交換。而期望兩國之將來。發見劃期的光明。吾人今日不欲論此代表之爲好爲壞。更不敢遥望此劃期的光明。惟有吉君旣得吾政府之同意而以公使之資格前來。總對之表示應有之敬意。願與一談其使命中所應注意之問題。</p>
<p>日本外交時報記者於送有吉公使文中。希望其「以浴於熱水之心地持其一身。待他日熱水之冷却而出於有效之手段。」有吉君對字林西報記者談話。亦表示接任以後。首先擬詳細研究今日時局之梗概。吾人對於此日本外交論士所希望。與有吉君所表示之觀望主義。認爲在目前中日外交環境中有其相當之需要。惟以爲有吉君在此觀望期中。不應作所謂出於有效手</p>
<p>段之準備。而應熟察中國之情形。出其所得。貢獻於霞關首腦。以改良日本之外交政策。譬如直接交涉之問題。外交時報記者。固以爲「倘使中國有卓邁之政治家。撤回在國聯之提議。出於中日直接交涉之態度。則兩國懸案一夜而可解决」者。然在此國土被佔日方高呼承認叛逆之形勢下。中國人民正一致憤激。共謀所以收復國家之領土。假有吉君以稍久之時日。此事能否。當能知之。有吉君能進言於其霞關首領。設法改變軍閥之侵略行爲乎。如果能之。則其觀望爲非徒勞。而有效之手段。亦未有善於此者。</p>
<p>有吉君所發表之談話中。表示願盡力恢復中日以前之親善狀態。確立以兩國共存共榮爲基礎之東亞和平。此吾人所常聞之日本式外交辭令也。而其後繼以「兩國之親善關係。須由充分互相諒解對方國之立場。對其國之需要。予以充分之協力。始克實現。」則内田式之亞洲門羅主義之色彩。極爲顯明矣。内田式亞洲門羅主義之爲中國人民所竭力反對。與其妨碍中日關係之恢復。假有吉君以稍久之時日。當亦能知之。有吉君能進言於内田外相。改變其不合時宜之主義乎。據日人雜誌所述。有吉君使華。爲内田外相特識之行爲。是則有吉君應有貢獻其意見於内田。而使改採較時宜之態度之義務也。</p>
<p>中日間在目前狀態下。本談不到外交。吾人因有吉公使爲與中國革命有頗久之關係者。今於中日關係極度緊張中奉使來華。勉述期待之意。有吉君更能以中國人民對日之心理。傳達於日本朝野。以阻止日政府之承認叛逆乎。有吉君旣願盡力恢復中日以前之親善。則此問題。即爲恢復親善之先决問題。有吉君能勉力爲之乎。雖然。日政府對承認叛逆。已如翦在弦上。不能不發。早爲人所共見。則吾人之希望。正與日本外交時報記者希望中國撤回國聯提議等。亦明知其不可而言之耳。然則有吉君將有何策以善其後。</p>

<p>自由談九三老人馬相伯語錄　　　雍正求刻壽星杖不獲遂惡教士  景·記·　　最近北平輔仁大學校長陳垣先生，寄一篇宗教史的論文，乞正於相老人。相老人看後，連稱：「好極丨是一位天生的史學家丨好極丨」　　有問比較梁任公如何？　　相老人答：梁任公長於撰述政論，他對於史學一門，是很粗疏的：想來留東時期，稍瀏覽些書籍。任公的新文筆很足以驚倒老輩；像援庵纔是一個史學家丨　　老人對本篇論文「雍正間奉天主教的宗室，」有補充的意見，曾經告訴過我。　　相老人說：「雍正皇帝爲什麽惡教士。據我的老師（晁德蒞先生）告訴過我，在當時傳教士的信札中提及。我親自看過那信札彚存，譯名可稱「可喜可驚的書信」。内述雍正做皇子時，得到一手杖，想請當時在内廷服務的教士，刻一個壽星頭。那個教士，想是一種中國迷信，拒絕不刻。隨來該教士將情形禀明在京教會的領袖。領袖認爲是一種裝飾品，刻亦無妨教規，命向雍正乞恕。可是這一次雍正已經惱羞成怒，無論如何賠不是，都不再理。直到他做皇帝後，這番交涉，餘怒猶存。對於一般教士，總帶厭惡的心理，一個皇帝竟如此爭小氣，成了歷史上大事件！」　　記得蔣方震先生序清代學術概論，另有紀聞，可互參閱。談姓  燧·丞·　　丨中國之姓八百有餘丨　　我國之姓多矣；明吳沈撰千家姓一書，所收姓凡一千九百六十有八，近世蒙塾所授之百家姓，亦載姓四百有奇。但實際上并無千九百之多，亦不僅四百之數，據某項統計報告，則爲八百五十餘姓，其中所列，離奇詭異，誠屬洋洋大觀。例如安徽合肥有開姓，而廣西融縣則有閉姓，廣東仁化有旋姓，而安徽渦陽則有轉姓，山西岢嵐有油姓，而河南濟源則有酒性，他如雀性·蟻姓，是以虫鳥爲姓也，笱姓，傘姓，是以器用姓也，怪誕離奇，諸如此類，殆難遍舉。又聞湖北有姓讓者，或謂其初本姓某，以其族好爭，遂取讓爲姓以自勉，或人之言如此，未知確否？按史記黥布傳載，布本姓英，少時有相之者，謂當刑而王，布遂改姓黥以厭當之；以彼例此，則以讓戒爭，事或有之耳。洋化的婦女  錢·台·生·　　丨是新中國典型的女人丨　　時下的女人，祇要伊會打扮，越漂亮，同一樣的代價，自然也越被人注意丨這不是說假話，一個能站在招待外人的宴席上，說得一口的外國話，又流利，又純熟，誰不說伊是一個社會中漂亮的女人？好在從高聳的胸膛到三寸的高跟，满身御帶着各國的鑽飾和綢緞，一枝口紅，一盒粉，能說得出一大堆外國名字，而且說得純粹是外國音，一點不帶土腔，就是天天見外國大使公使的外交部長，也得望之遜色！　　衣服的形式，自然不必講，即是家中房屋器具也都一律洋式，那洋馬桶，洋飯碗，洋調羹，：：：遍踏海上各洋大公司，配合洋家具，去佈置那洋房子。　　於是坐着别克；林肯的汽車進出，呌兒子入洋人辦的學堂，出來能說一口洋話，便能在洋行裏洋人手下効忠効勞一下？　　你能責備這些中國人的洋太太麽？伊們也正因爲有那大腹便便，满肚黄金，在洋人手下効勞的主子，任伊揮霍任伊洋化，你有什麽辦法？　　洋化的婦女，誰都在歌頌着是新中國時代下的女人！這些洋化的女人，永遠爲新中國典型的女人！自由談  芳·洲·　　丨一猜就着專誠提倡丨　　楊杏佛先生說：「跳舞在外國，不成一種嗜好；一到中國來，便和聲色狗馬吃喝嫖賭打成一片。進跳舞塲的人，變成了維持舞塲營業的人，變成了舞女脚底下的磚頭丨」　　王寵惠先生說：「中國人的事，你從壞處一猜就着！」　　這眞是一猜就着！　　ＸＸＸＸＸ　　用了劣貨的紙張來寫「抵制劣貨」的標語。　　穿了新做的洋裝來講「提倡國貨。」　　躱在安全的内地勸同胞「殺到東北去丨」　　：：：：：：：：：　　自已不能做的事，只要來提倡，去勸别人做，正是「專誠提倡，不作别用。」理想的教育村  心·佛·　　丨理想爲事實之母丨　　吾們創辦這個理想的教育村有兩個目標：（一）解决人才過剩的失業問題。本來中國這時候百廢待興，只可說缺乏人才，怎能說人才過剩？但現在的社會，赤裸裸地說一句，是崇拜資格，是位置親友，是系統團體所佔領的社會。有天才，有學問，有辦事能力，而無頭銜，缺乏得力親友，不喜逢迎，未曾加入系統團體，就無進身之門，就無發展天才，學問，辦事能力之可能。這就是我所說的過剩人才。理想的教育村就是要解决這個問題。　　以現代眼光而論，所謂「下層」就是指着未曾進學校的無智識階級，和全國人數百分之八十五之村農。以上兩項「下層」合計，約佔全國人數百分之九十五而强。這樣大的數目，要想實行一種教育計劃，頗非易易，這個問題如何解决？惟有實現理想的教育村。一而二，二而四，四而八，：：：。　　所謂理想的教育村，究竟是什麽？乃是以生産組織爲人才集中點，辦理生利事業，首先解决生計問題。同時實行普及民衆教育。所生的利都是民衆的，不過替他們分派，一部分用以維持生計，一部分用爲教育經費，一部分用爲推廣的經費。　　教育村的地點，乃是利用公地，荒地，所用的人才乃是現代社會落伍的過剩人才：創辦的事業，乃是先從合作實業入手。至於詳細情形，自能另有具體的計劃。　　我看過中國民生自助社的說明書，知道他們正是這個宗旨，正是預備這樣辦。我爲全國的落伍人才，和「下層」同胞們，馨香禱祝他們的成功丨　　短訊各畫家申石伽氏、所作工細山水、純守宋元各家法、去冬因母病返杭、居西湖半年、已將所積各件、依次理清、聞近已來滬、寓牛莊路友聲旅行團、有旬日勾留云、銀絲（七）  江紅蕉　　（四）　　諸伯方神通廣大，居然得到了袁團長的允許，在行落成禮的那天，親自到塲參加；並且城裏的一切軍政當局也都預先約定，一律到會參加。　　小學校裏結着綵，掛着旗幟，從市杪到會塲，都植了許多掛旗幟的木杆，全鎭上貼满了許多「歡迎勞苦功高的袁團長，」和「民族英雄不死」等標語。在這一天，全鎭都休業半天，無論男女老少，個個都充满了興奮的精神，想瞻仰袁團長的言論丰采。　　預定行禮的時間，是下午兩點鐘，没有一個人，不是伸長了頸項，盼望袁團長的蒞臨，但是敲過了兩點鐘，許多重要的來賓，也都到齊，擔任揭幕的，還是諸綺蘭女士，伊打扮得像天仙一般，周旋於許多上賓之間，格外地盼望袁團長，而袁團長却遲遲不到。諸伯方早已布置妥貼，在東市杪橋上有一隊軍樂隊，專等袁團長一到，便大奏其樂，於是沿路施放爆竹，但是橋上的軍樂，始終没有聲息。大家都有些疑惑，諸伯方屢次地解釋，袁團長軍務倥偬，也許因爲公事忙，所以遲這麽一二分鐘來，是不能抱怨的。大家以爲袁團長到鎭上來，一定有衛隊前導，他穿着很漂亮的軍裝，而騎着高大的白馬，這是大將應有的威儀。諸伯方所派在鎭外迎接的人，整整地在田岸間站了兩小時以上，始終不曾見有過一匹馬一個兵或一個軍官走過，等候得十分不耐煩了。　　余芬若依舊在家裏，不想去參加這盛典，因爲伊的丈夫，以前也當過營長，不幸早已死了，伊見到這少年軍官盛大的榮譽，未免觸景傷情；並且袁瘋子，恰巧在這大瘋病復發，需要伊的照顧，所以伊很孤寂地留在家中。　　還有放繡貨的王先生，他有異樣的見解，他以爲這是諸伯方個人出風頭而結好於軍政人員的一個階梯，實無參與的必要。他知道芬若是不浪費光隂的一個人，預料伊一定不會抛棄了刺繡而去瞧熱鬧，所以想去訪着芬若，或者可以談出一些比較有意味而適合於他目的的談話，可以增進他希望的機會。　　諸綺蘭正似在做夢一般，他想：袁團長還没有娶親，當今的闊人軍官，都在那裏找覓年輕而漂亮的姑娘做老婆，尤其是要摩登的姑娘，袁團長當然不能例外。自問臉龐，衣飾，態度，言語，無一不適合於摩登姑娘的條件，在這樣盛典的舉行，當然是父親的功勞，他一定對我特别垂青。第一句話，該怎麽措詞，才可以使袁團長特别注意，歡喜，而從此永留在他腦底，不致遺忘？伊在斟酌，考慮，一再地修改，才决定了，見了面先上前握手，再用一朶鮮花，插在他襟上，而向他說：「謹代表全鎭的人，向團長慰勞，因爲給與我們土地的保全，民族的光榮。」做土匪去  燧·亟·　　本星期一，汪精衛先生，在中央紀念週席上，報告共赴國難之意義，及熱河問題時；至熱河省政府主席湯玉麟氏，殘殺義勇軍，自爲土匪事；憤然曰：「日人以土匪視我義勇軍，已屬可惡，今湯氏亦稱之爲土匪，則我儕爲自衛救國計，寗舍棄中央委員不幹，做日人所謂之土匪去！做湯氏所謂之土匪去！大家聯合起來，都做土匪去！：：：」夫湯氏以一省大員，旣視義勇軍爲土匪，更進而摧殘之，比之日人，其爲可惡，尤有甚焉！無怪汪氏言之痛心也。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　言情變  佛　　不但江北小三子和阿金姐拆拚頭，王阿毛和李巧雲離婚，這種情變的不幸事件，每天不知要發生多少，忙得法院裏的幾位法官，打起精神，去判斷這「兩造均屬無恥」的勾當，就是有地位有人格的人，情變的案件，也不知引起了多少人的注意，　　從前的婚姻，的確是「强制」的「盲目」的「賣買式」的，所以必定要自由結婚，自由變愛，這樣就可以不發生情變的事情了，然而事實告訴我們則大大的不然，現在比較下來，自由變愛的情變，還要比「父母之命媒妁之言」的婚姻，情變更多，就是對於人生哲學很有澈底研究的學者，恐也逃不出這個情網，　　本來一個女子，無論怎樣「千嬌百媚」怎樣「温柔敦厚」，總不能如男子理想中所期待，一個男子，任你怎樣「多才多藝」，怎樣「倜儻風流」，亦不能如女子理想中所期待，在未婚之前，爲情魔所誘惑，爲虚僞所欺飾，爲性慾所衝動，遂不免墮入情網，一到結婚以後，西洋鏡子，完全拆穿，種種弱點，顯豁呈露，而情變於以開始，　　見色相悅，人之常情，厭故喜新，原是人類心理的常態，而環境的誘惑，又如唐僧之取經，一難旣去，一難又來，無論年青的人，不能立定脚根，與環境奮鬥，即比較年齡稍長的人，恐亦未免忒忒於心，故孔子曰「我未見好德如好色者也」，孟子曰「食色性也」，可知性的難關，不易打破如此，　　這個問題，在幾年前，也曾有過幾位學者，加以討論，或謂眞正變愛，必以道德爲附帶條件，或謂眞正變愛，道德即寓乎其中，到底附帶呢？庽乎其中呢？迄今還没有得到一個確實的結論，不過我想，眞正澈底的自由，必定要還到人類原始時代的性交方式，方爲澈底，否則人性本惡，若無道德廉恥爲之制裁，則性變之案件，眞是方興未艾呢，文藝滬上女  馮乃駿　　滬上婦女，競尚不襪而履，圓膚畢露，曲線俱呈，因賦七律一章，其亦風人立旨乎，　　五銖衣薄稱腰身，風動裾揚妙入神，自喜蠻靴能貼地，不教羅襪更生塵，藕絲雪溜脂韋滑，蓮步光摇肌理匀，一種春情難掩處，何須甲帳與横陳，閒居有感　　蘭成蕭瑟悟盈虚，爲賦江南淚满裾，王謝門庭題有鳳，原嘗賓客食無魚，士難醫俗思栽竹，字不療飢怕讀書，萬事消沉拚一醉，放懷天地即吾廬，科學煤氣製造法  允釐　　煤氣是氣體燃料中最好的一種。燈，暖爐，廚房，實騐室和工廠等，都是常用　做燃料。由此看來，這是多麽有益於人類的東西喲。但是牠旣這樣的有益於人類，我們對於牠的性質和製法，何能不知道呢？　　煤氣是由煤製出來的。這種氣裏，含有一氣化炭，性質甚毒，實騐時要小心，若在室内裝置煤氣管時，務須嚴密封閉，不可使煤氣洩露，以防中毒。　　牠的製法，是先把煤的碎屑，放入一個有底的玻璃管内，約放至管的十分之二三的容積爲止。然後將管的下部，用鐵絲網包起來。次在管口上塞一個有孔的軟木塞，木塞的孔内，揷一根彎曲玻璃管，管的一端，接一節橡皮管，橡皮管的一端，再接一根彎曲的玻璃管。另用個玻璃瓶，把裏面裝满着水。瓶口上塞有兩孔的軟木塞；一個孔内，揷入那較長的玻璃管。另一個孔内，揷一根上端稍尖而有小孔的玻璃管。但要注意，不可揷入水裏。因爲若揷入水裏，水裏浮上來的氣，不能由尖口的玻管出來。這樣預備好後，把那包有鐵絲網的玻管用夾鉗夾緊，移到酒燈上加熱，就看見玻璃瓶内的水中，有氣泡浮上來。在這個時候，你若刮根火柴送到尖玻管的口上燃點，便可以看見燃點的火燄。這火燄就是那玻管内的煤製出來的煤氣。　　煤何以能製煤氣呢？這是因爲煤放在玻璃管時，和外界的空氣隔絕，再加上很高的熱，就發出炭質和氫氣相化合的氣體來。這氣體中混有氫氣，硇精和炭質這等類的東西。所以用水氢硇精和炭質溶解，那剩下的氣體，就是可以燃燒的煤氣。那殘留玻璃管中的物品，就是蕉炭。　　煤氣中混合的硇精和炭質，爲什麽社會之寄生蟲（二）募建王臓廟銓　　要把牠溶在水中？這是因爲製煤的目的，是要牠燃燒。而硇精和炭氣是不可以燃燒的。若混合在煤氣中，恐要减小燃燒的力量，所以就把牠溶在水中。改良社會討論會住宅的改良  鳳·子·　　上海的地價，一天高一天。上海的馬路，一天闊一天。十八元一月，二十元一月底一上一下的弄堂房子，一天一天的减少。地産公司，地皮老班，不造房子則已，造起來，非造每幢五十兩，六十兩的，便造七層大樓，八層大厦。於是乎上海的居民，本來分爲上中下三等的，現在被這些挺胸疊肚的地皮老班，硬生生的歸納成了二級。本來住洋房的上等居民，不成問題，仍可以住新式的洋房。本來一樓一底住着四五户人家的下等居民，不成問題，再搭上一個三層擱，倒也不見得苦悶。惟有每月十八元，二十元獨借一上一下石庫門的中等居民，洋房住不起，擱樓住不下，房東又鐵面無情，勒限拆屋，那眞是走投無路，住不得也哥哥丨　　這一個問題，不單是上海有，世界上各大都市，都有的。所以世界上各大都市裏，都有一種「寄宿舍」的建築，去供給中下等居民居住。這種「寄宿舍」二十層一三十層，佔天不佔地，儘管造上</p>

<p>去。每一層，分成若干宅。每宅裏，包含寢室，浴室，書室，會客室，飯間，廚房等，一切應有盡有。但也不一定這麽完備，有的很簡單，只有寢室，浴室，飯間，廚房。有的索性只有寢室，其餘的一切，如浴室，書室，會客室，飯廳，廚房等，均是公共的。一切的完備與簡單，當然是跟租金做標準的。要舒服些的中等居民，可以租住設備完備些的。經濟拮据些的下等居民，不妨住一宅簡單些的。所以他們從中等以下的居民，對於住的問題，可以同上等的居民，同樣的没有恐慌。　　現在上海也造了不少的「寄宿舍」。最著名的，是亞爾培路上的那座大厦。新近造的，如北蘇州路自來水橋堍上的那座「河邊村」，其他如上海銀行，華安保險公司等大厦的樓上，都有「寄宿舍」出租。内部的一切構造，都同各大都市的「寄宿舍」相仿。但是有一層困難。這些「寄宿舍」的租金，也同各大都市的「寄宿舍」一樣的高貴。你倘使没有住上海的洋房的經濟力，那你也莫想住外國中等以下的居民所住的「寄宿舍」。於是乎上海的一切「寄宿舍」到底僅僅解决了各國中下等僑民的住，中國的中下等居民，就祇有自嘆自已做的是中國人，没福享受。　　因此，我現在有一個提議，請各建築公司和地皮老班，建造些適合於上海中下等居民胃口的「寄宿舍」一切建築，設備等等，我雖對於建築學，經濟學，毫無門徑，但我想總當以「公共的，愈完備愈妙，私人的，愈簡單愈妙」爲原則。我想這樣一來，上海當有一番新氣象，而不論上中下任何一階級的居民，或許可以不致再鬧「乏屋居住」的恐慌了！學堂寫眞第五課  雲·賡·　　除了星期一的總理紀念週外，每天上午的末了一課！第五課！都是我們見了就討厭的國文課，我們因爲一早就上課，接連上了三四課，到這時腦經也混亂了，精神也疲乏了，肚子也覺得餓了，所以做教師的儘管開足馬力，講得天花亂墜，但是終不能使這班比頑石還不如的我們感到興趣，洗耳恭聽，丨有的低着頭寫情書，看小說：有的偷偷摸摸地在挖魚皮花生吃：有的索性躺着身子在打中覺；：：：　　一天一天的照常營業，不覺已過了二個月了，可是我們還是這般有意無意地上課下課：Ｃ先生丨國文教師丨仍是按月拿薪水，他每天在上課的時候，還是像無線電臺上的播音講師一般地向着我們自拉自唱，做獨脚戲，　　在星期三的一天，他突然提出了一個問題，這也許是他的内心底不安的反照吧，　　「我這樣的教法不行吧？怎樣你們幾個都一點也没有興致？我們今天來討論討論，」　　他停了一回，又繼續著說：　　「你們喜歡怎樣教法？那一類的文章？」　　「我以爲這樣一篇篇的亂讀，一點没有系統，未免太散漫了，我想我們不如分門别類地選讀幾個有名作家的代表作品，讀後再加以一番研究，批評其得失，這樣似乎能夠多得一些益處，」一個穿著中山裝的同學提議着，　　「著丨這樣到不差，」Ｃ先生右手拿着半段粉筆，左手抹着他的頷部，現着很得意的神色回答，　　「你們喜歡那一類的文章？」接着又問，　　「先生，文章有好多種類丨請你把每類文章的名字和内容都完全寫出了，然後讓我們仔細討論和選擇，」一個穿着自由布長衫，戴眘三百度眼鏡的同學Ｅ說，　　「怎麽？這是什麽話？你不是要我把歷代的書本子都抄出來？」笑容满面的Ｃ先生，忽然換上一副冷靜嚴酷的臉兒反問着，　　「呵丨先生，你又誤會了，我的意思是因爲我們學識淺薄，那裏知道某類文章的得失好壞？所以請求你，很摯誠懇切地請求你把各類文章都抄出來，讓我們有充分的考慮决斷的時間，然後加以討論而回覆你的問題，」　見着Ｃ先生發了怒，馬上就轉舵換向，用一副滑稽的口吻回答，　　「：：：：：：：：：：：：：：：：」　　「我們喜歡要有實用的，或是富於情感的文章，」這是另外一個提議，　　「噹，噹噹，噹，：：：」一課又完了，可是仍還没有一點結果，拍拍的檯板響，咯咯的皮鞋聲，嘻嘻哈哈的笑聲，：：：一時都熱鬧起來了，　　「肚子餓了，吃飯鐘快要敲了，大家不要再去討論國文的教學問題了，還是去努力加餐飯，解决民生問題罷丨」市場訊　　羣治大學同學會登記訊羣治大學同學會，遷設上海法租界拉都路敦和里四十六號，兹已正式開始徵求會員，登記者已達二百餘人，凡該校畢業生肄業生均可逕至該會登記，章程登記表函索附郵即寄云，　　永盛昌烟行特别大廉價盆湯弄中市永盛昌烟行，向經理麥加利烟廠出品各種　球雪茄烟，裝璜美麗，烟味香醇，價廉物美，久已馳名中外，兹適逢秋節，即日起爲利便各界人士送禮宴客起見，將原價特别削碼大廉價平沽减價期内，仍將他廠名貴雪茄烟捲烟一併廉價出售公布欄江蘇高等法院第二分院　　民事判决吳日永與張秉生因債務涉訟上訴一案原判决關於利息部分變更上訴人應給付被上訴人自民國二十年四月一日起至清償日止週年五厘之利息其餘上訴及被上訴人開於上開部分其餘之訴均駁回第二審訴訟費用由上訴人負担十分之九被上訴人負担十分之一▲致和永記錢莊清理處與黄士希欵票涉訟上訴案上訴駁回第二審訴訟費用由上訴人負担▲南華經理保險公司與人和號賠償涉訟上訴案上訴駁回第二審訴訟費用由上訴人負担▲鄧仲澤與鄧文海分産涉訟上訴案原判决關於認定鄧禮賓遺産數額及訟費部分變更鄧禮賓遺産計港洋十三萬八千一百五十五元八角三分又新廣安股本美金一千元福安公司股票票面三萬七千五百元怡記股票票面三萬元應由上訴人各按其種類數額分與被上訴人七分之一但應將被上訴人透支港洋七千元在其應分之數額内予以扣除其餘上訴及被上訴人其餘之訴曁附帶上訴並假執行之聲請均駁回第一二兩審訴訟費用由被上訴人負担四分之三餘由上訴人負担　　民事裁定李慰庭與翁庸均賠償涉訟假扣押案抗告原裁定廢棄發回江蘇上海第一特區地方法院更爲裁定　　刑事判决程畏因吸食鴉片一案上訴駁回▲俞來發因殺人一案上訴駁回　　刑事裁定邵雲鵬等因盛澤丞卽盛恩頣等侵占抗告一案抗告駁回上海第一特區地方法院　　刑事第一審判决周漢魁竊盜處有期徒刑六月▲謝和尚竊盜處拘役四十日▲張順順竊盜處有期徒刑六月▲徐阿三共同恐嚇未遂累犯一罪處有期徒刑六月共同傷人累犯一罪處有期徒刑六月執行徒刑十一月沈宋岳共同傷人一罪處有期徒刑二月裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日▲龔賜福訴王旭東等詐欺案本件不受理▲老閘捕房訴陳阿大等竊盜案陳阿大共同竊盜處有期徒刑三月汪大里收受贓物累犯處有期徒刑六月胡阿龍收受贓物處拘役二十日緩刑二年▲老閘捕房訴范洪生殺人案范洪生豫謀殺人未遂一罪處有期徒刑七年殺人一罪處有期徒刑十年執行徒刑十五年附帶民訴移送民庭審判▲張興發姚兆發賭博財物各處罰金一百元▲陳茂生意圖供販賣之用而持有鴉片烟具處有期徒刑二月▲張寳峯訴王松濤等傷害案本件不受理▲陸阿安意圖販賣而持有鴉片處有期徒刑六月併科罰金三百元　　民事第一審判决特爾物生與張阿根等借欵案（主文）被告潘芝蘭應分期償還原告借欵八十元由民國二十一年九月起至二十二年四月止按月給付十元訟費由被告潘芝蘭負担▲三興煤號與包大廷保證案（主文）被告應代華豐公司償還原告貨欵二百六十八兩五錢三分訟費由被告負擔▲聞達生與張福等借欵案（主文）張福　分期償還原告借欵一百元自民國二十一年九月起至二十二年六月止按月給付十元如張福無力償還應由娘娘代償訟費由被告負担▲陸元素與張繼棠欠欵案（主文）被告應償還原告銀四千元及自民國二十年十二月二十五日起至執行終了日按月一分之利息訟費由被告負担▲葛鴉亮等與謝伯殳等欠欵案（主文）被告應就正義銀行財産清償原告葛鴉亮銀七百零九兩零六分梁國堯銀一百八十六兩六錢四分徐正煜銀二百八十二兩九錢三分均週年利息百分之五自本年八月八日起又清償原告張行權銀五十三兩一錢四分四釐洋五百七十九兩三角一分九釐均按月利息百分之九自民國二十年十一月十九日起又清償原告徐立才洋十五元九角六分金朱氏四百二十一元四角一分均按月利息百分之八自民國二十年十一月十九日起均至執行終結日止並對清償不足之欵關於葛鴉亮梁國堯徐正煜張行權徐立才及所欠金朱氏洋三百四十五元六角三分本利部分負連帶償還之資關於所欠金朱氏洋七十五元七角八分部分負連合分担之無限責任原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由被告負担▲單雲章與鐘根大等墊欵案（主文）被告王榮記應於本年九月三日將原告署名借用之三百元借劵一紙交原告收回並將原告其被告鐘根大共同署名借用之四百元借劵一紙就原告部分設法使其免責原告其餘之訴駁回訴訟費用由原告負担五之分四被告王榮記負擔五分之一▲元懋地産公司與慕義學校欠租案（主文）被告應償還原告房租八百元准由本年九月起至十月止按月給付四百元被告置於上海東熈華德路懷興里四十七號之物准予留置其餘之訴及假執行之聲請均駁回訴訟費用被告負擔▲公大米號與侯松發貨欵案（主文）被告應償還原告貨欵一百六十二元四角由民國二十一年九月起至二十二年四月止按月給付二十元零三角訟費由被告負担▲瞿成記米號與瞿鵠章欠欵案（主文）被告應償還原告洋九千元並自起訴之日起至執行終了日止週年五釐之遲延利息原告其餘之訴駁回訴訟費用由被告負担四分之三其餘由原告負担▲張永來與楊偉車價案（主文）被告應給付原告銀八百八十七兩六錢並返還原告飛亞脫汽車一輛訟費由被告負担▲俞元來與王金莊賠償案（主文）被告應償還原告汽車修理費一百兩其餘之訴駁回訟費由兩造平均負担▲振豐棉織廠與五洲襪廠票欵案（主文）被告應償還原告銀一千九百七十九兩三錢並自本年一月二十日起至執行終了日止週年五釐之遲延利息訴訟費用由被告負担▲施啟祥與金榮甫詐財民訴案（主文）被告金榮甫嚴金福應平均分担償還原告洋一百四十四元三角四分原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由原告負担八分之七金榮甫嚴金福平均負担八分之一▲五豐莊與大耀建築公司欠欵案（主文）被告應償還原告銀五萬五千兩及自本年三月二十二日起至清償日止按月九釐之利息原告假執行之聲請駁回訟費由被告負担▲謝勷周與張盤金等賠償案（主文）被告張盤金袁克飛應賠償原告銀四百二十六元三角六分如不能履行時由被告顧銀寳代還原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由原告負担十分之六被告等平均負担十分之四▲英商哈同洋行與德川源裕記號欠租案（主文）被告應償還原告租金七百九十五兩又洋二十五元原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由被告負担十分之八原告負担十分之一▲朱光佈與周柏林等賠償案（主文）被告周柏林夏和卿應連帶賠償原告銀四千三百四十七元及自民國二十一年五月十八日起至執行終了日止週年百分之五之利息前項賠欵以銀二千五百元爲度應予假執行被告周柏林應償還原告銀九十一元四角被告夏和卿應償還原告銀一千二百四十一元七角八分及自民國二十一年五月十八日起至執行終了日止週年百分之五之利如如無力清償時由被告孔蔡陽王慶生負共同代償之責關於夏和卿應償部分原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由原告負担八分之三被告周柏林夏和卿連帶負担八分之四被告夏和卿負担八分之一　　民事第二審判决上訴人徐惠慶與劉鴻薰公費案（主文）上訴駁回上訴訟費由上訴人負担　　刑事第二審判决上訴人亞巴林克不服詐欺案（主文）原判撤銷亞巴林無罪　　民事批示劉岳山爲與陳德　借欵案聲請執行由狀悉查此案已據債務人提起上訴所請應從緩議此批▲香港國民銀行與程霖生欠欵案聲請銷案由狀悉應准銷案此批▲京都食物院與李福增貨欵案聲請執行由狀悉候飭傳訊追此批▲顧良忠與聯安機器廠欠租案聲請執行由狀悉候派員執行此批▲喬治第德海姆與謝克昌欠欵案請執行由狀悉本案業已上訴所請應毋庸議此批▲納郎生與朱玉林債務案請執行由狀悉本案尚未確定所請應從緩議此批▲趙炳産與葛傑臣債務案請銷案由狀悉准予銷案此批▲張志發與凌芝善欠欵案請銷案由狀悉准予銷案此批▲王世榮等與楊樹林償務案請領欵由狀悉本案係合併執行應候訊明核奪此批▲馬海洋行與亞琴台太司欠租案請直接領欵由狀悉查阿琴台里生活費執行一案僅據債務人繳到洋六百元是否由本案債權人提接具領仰候訊明核奪此批　　刑事批示沙雲衢遵諭備具店保呈請領回前繳保證金尔五百元由狀悉着另覓妥保再行核奪此批▲包黑沙夫請發還醫生證明書由狀悉仰卽來院具領此批▲袁錫泉呈請具領前訴鄧仲澤詐財案内所繳證物三百兩袁錫泉户各福安公司存單一紙由狀悉着備具妥實店保再行呈候核奪此批　　佈告本院執行債權人愼豐永廠與債務人何　林因貨物涉訟一案業將債務人所有後開財物查封　價在案兹定於九月十二日上午十一時爲拍賣日期由本院派書記官指揮承發吏實施拍賣凡居民人等欲買是項財物者仰即來本院承發吏辦公室報明以便領赴所在地閱看後違期承買如承買者有二人以上時則以出價最高者爲承買人當場交足價銀卽將拍賣之財物給與具領仰居民人等一體週知特此佈告（計開）（一）拍賣

They had infiltrated from the Fengling area of Fujian. The local security forces, outnumbered, retreated to Taiping Pass. Reinforcements arrived at 7 p.m. that evening and immediately counterattacked, repelling the bandits by 6 a.m. on the 6th and recovering the lost territory.

<p>Preventing Mongolian Princes from Being Enticed (Nanjing) After the violent Japanese occupation of the Eastern Provinces, the Mongolian Committee believes that recently, the Japanese have been using various conspiracies to entice princes from places like Chahar and Mongolia to secede from the central government. To prevent this, representatives of various banners and leagues stationed in Beijing were convened a few days ago to discuss countermeasures and formulate specific plans. The committee is scheduled to convene a meeting of various directors on the 7th, and after submitting it for discussion at the regular meeting on the 8th, it will be submitted to the government for approval and implementation. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Implementation of Responsible Transportation on All Routes (Nanjing) Since the Ministry of Railways issued an order to implement responsible transportation throughout the country, the Longhai Railway has decided to implement it in three phases. Starting from November 1st, the first phase will focus on goods such as kerosene, cigarettes, Lanzhou water tobacco, compressed cotton, hides, and medicinal materials at five stations: Dapu, Xinpu, Zhengzhou, Shaanzhou, and Tongguan. Currently, they are rushing to repair 20 covered wagons and build warehouses, freight yards, and other facilities. The Jiaoji Railway is preparing to expand the scope of responsibility and issue bills of lading to meet the needs of merchants. The Pinghan Railway is preparing to first select 15 major stations: Beijing, Qianmen, Fengtai, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Shunde, Han'e, Zhangde, Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, Buzhou, Changcheng, Madian, Xinyang, and Dazhimen, and begin implementation on October 1st.

The railway was originally operated by merchants and was recovered by the government in the 21st year, and 200,000 public bonds were issued to complete the road. These public bonds have been repaid. (2) The suppression of bandits in Guangdong is going smoothly. In the Dahekou battle, the Red Bandits lost over 10,000 men. The reason for the disintegration of the bandits is the lack of guns and ammunition. During battles, weak men are at the front, and those with guns are at the rear. All wounded bandit soldiers are executed by firing squad, and recently, about 1,000 wounded soldiers were executed. The bandits' monthly expenses were originally 600,000, but due to the migration of the people, it has been reduced to over 300,000. Originally, each soldier was given 10 cents of silver per day, but now each soldier can only get five copper coins per day. If the bandit suppression armies can cooperate and advance together, without holding back their strength and being timid, they will definitely be able to thoroughly eliminate the bandits. The previous rumor that the Guangdong army, Li Yangjing, retreated is not true. They are now advancing from the flank. (3) Hu Hanmin still resides in Hong Kong, enjoying reading.

<p>German Government Orders Implementation of Economic Reform Plan President Signs Another Emergency Decree Aims to Rescue Small Industries Across the Nation Parliament Scheduled to Reconvene Next Monday Papen to Announce General Policy The National Press reported from Berlin on the 5th that the German government today announced President Hindenburg's emergency decree, implementing the new year-long industrial plan to revive industry. This plan is a great attempt by Germany to extricate itself from the economic recession and contains very important financial and economic reforms. Prime Minister Papen elaborated on the main points in a speech in Münster on the 28th of last month. The main points are (1) Increase public works expenditure fivefold. (2) Assist the government in reducing benefits for the disabled and the elderly. (3) Assist the Ministry of Finance in guaranteeing 40 million marks to supplement industrial loans, 50 million marks to be lent to border agencies and individuals (mostly landowners), and 45 million marks to be lent to consumer cooperatives and farmers' lending institutions. (4) The salaries of all employees in government-subsidized enterprises must be reduced so that they are equal to those of civil servants, that is, no more than 3,600 marks per year. Reuters reported from Berlin on the 5th that President Hindenburg today signed another important order aimed at reducing unemployment and rescuing small industries across the nation. This order contains new procedures for restoring the German economy. The original text may not be published before Tuesday, but it is known that the proposed measures include (1) Simplifying social insurance procedures and reducing its cost. (2) Preserving the principle of wage contracts, but allowing amendments to suit local conditions and the urgent situation of various industries, and stipulating that employers may reduce wages when hiring workers, but the reduction may not exceed 20% of the standard wage. This order also contains a surprising measure that stipulates that employers who hire new workers will receive a bonus of 400 marks in redeemable tax vouchers for each new worker hired. In addition, there are (A) more flexible ways of allocating welfare allowances among municipalities, (B) reducing capital taxes, (C) reducing the salaries of various industrial institutions managed or subsidized by the state to the same level as civil servants. Officials explain this emergency economic order, saying that the government believes that private industry is still the best way to meet the economic needs of the people, so it must revive the declining forces in private industry. The government will soon raise 750,000,000 marks for public works expenditure. This purpose is bound to have a good impact on private industry. In addition, it is planned to allocate 50 million marks of circulating tax vouchers for house repairs, and it is planned to reduce borrowing rates as soon as possible. All of these can benefit private industry. As for farmers, they will also benefit from the abolition of the milk tax and the implementation of import quotas for agricultural products.</p>

<p>Important News Japanese Patriot Soldiers' Theories on Guaranteeing Occupation Abridged Translation of "Japan's War Against the World" by Lieutenant Commander of the Japanese Navy, Fujita Ishimaru Self-Defense Rights and Guaranteeing Occupation Second Gorfu Island Incident The translation reads, with the Nakamura Captain Incident as the point of contention, the feelings between China and Japan are already very tense, and the Japanese military has repeatedly advocated that in order to resolve the incident, it should take action to guarantee occupation when necessary. I cannot help but hold deep concerns when I hear this, because I am worried that Japan will not be able to tolerate it and will resort to force first under the pretext of necessity. If Japan starts the war first, even if the real cause is to protect legitimate interests, it cannot become a war of self-defense. In detail, in order to be considered a self-defense war, the opposing country must first challenge me with force, and then I can be allowed to protect myself.</p>
<p>If Japan still ignores the consequences and insists on guaranteeing occupation, it will become a second Gorfu Island Incident, and the outcome may be unfavorable to us. The Gorfu Island Incident is a good lesson in terms of the nature of guaranteeing occupation. Please briefly describe its content for reference. As a result of the Paris Peace Conference, Italy and Greece had various struggles over the territory of the newly independent country of Albania. After the Ambassador's Conference, commissioners from England, France, and Italy were sent as border agreement commissioners to personally go to the local area to resolve border disputes. Unexpectedly, in August 1922, the head of the border agreement commission, Italian General Shao Lini, and his subordinates were assassinated by Greek rioters in Garna, near Albania in northern Greece. The Italian government, with Mussolini in power, made serious representations to the Greek government, and on the pretext that the Greek response was unsatisfactory, suddenly dispatched the Italian fleet to occupy Gorfu Island, a Greek territory in the Adriatic Sea, as a guarantee for the resolution of the issue. The Greek government, believing that this was an act of combat in</p>

<p>Director Wen insists on issuing the arrears and transferring the payment</p>
<p>The Finance Bureau declares that the salary arrears have nothing to do with the city treasury</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency said that the former director of the Public Security Bureau in the transition between the old and the new, Mr. Wen Yingxing, did not allow the transfer due to the problem of accumulated police salary arrears the day before yesterday. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is heard that the Public Security Bureau has not received the municipal government's order to approve the allocation of transfer funds yesterday, so the new Director Wen Hongen still failed to take office yesterday. At 9:00 this morning, all staff of the Public Security Bureau are scheduled to hold a meeting to bid farewell to Director Wen and take photos to commemorate him. Xin Sheng News Agency reporter talked to Director Wen at 7:35 pm last night through a city phone call. My departure is not a problem, but I must wait until the municipal government approves and allocates the arrears before I can leave the bureau. If the arrears are not cleared, there is no way to report the expenses and there is no way to face the staff under my command. As of now, it is 7:35 pm. If the order can arrive, I can handle the handover at 8:00 pm, etc. The new Director Wen has internally decided to appoint Sun Pu and Chen Zuomin as secretaries, and Li Mu as the chief of the first section. It is said that some of the other staff and district chiefs outside the bureau will also be changed. The chief of the first section of the bureau, Zhen Shao, and the chief of the third section, Wu Zhiqian, have resigned yesterday.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reporter specially inquired about the responsible personnel of the Finance Bureau about the accumulated losses mentioned by Director Wen Yingxing of the Public Security Bureau yesterday. According to the conversation, after the January 28th Incident, the city's finances have seen a sharp decrease in revenue and a sharp increase in expenditure, and monthly income has fallen short of expenditure, making it extremely difficult to cope with. However, the police salary for public security has been worked hard to plan, and it has always been paid in advance every month. Moreover, even if the city strictly implements austerity policies, the bureau's expenses, although nominally reduced to 120,000 yuan, have not been reduced in practice, including the amount of insufficient payment. It is estimated that the deficit in February was 30,000 yuan, and the deficit in March was more than 20,000 yuan. After being approved by the municipal government, the bureau allocated the funds at any time. This is more than the monthly recurring expenditure of more than 142,000 yuan before the war. The temporary expenses that have been paid are not included. In short, the bureau is for the expenses of the Public Security Bureau. All that is needed in fact is to find ways to pay first, no matter how difficult the city treasury is. The facts are there and can be reviewed. As for all the expenses of the Public Security Bureau in August, the Finance Bureau had cleared them by the end of the month. The police salary for August of the Public Security Bureau was not paid because the bureau diverted the funds it received, resulting in inflexible turnover, which has nothing to do with the city treasury.</p>
<p>Central News Agency said that the newly appointed Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Hongen, was originally scheduled to take over the bureau the day before yesterday. However, due to a slight problem with the police salary, it was postponed to the 8th to take over the bureau. Case of embezzlement by the Public Security Bureau personnel</p>
<p>The municipal government was ordered to send personnel to thoroughly investigate</p>
<p>Central News Agency said that the case of Han Jin, the chief secretary of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, instigating Zhang Shaoyi, the director of the stolen goods section of the third section, to embezzle, the central government has ordered the municipal government to thoroughly investigate and deal with it. After receiving the order, the municipal government has appointed Councilor Luo Panhui to conduct a thorough investigation together with the newly appointed Director of the Public Security Bureau, Wen Hongen, so as to punish them severely according to law. Special report from the shipping industry</p>
<p>Northeast merchants returned south and the Volunteer Army repeatedly attacked Shenyang, causing great panic among the Japanese troops stationed in Shenyang. Residents were prohibited from going out without a reason. Merchants in Shenyang were uneasy and in danger every day. More than 160 merchants from the south, including Yu Qiushan, Song Jingxiu, Chen Moxian, Yu Liren, and Ding Jinhou, all tried to come south from Shenyang. They experienced hardships along the way, first arrived in Dalian and then transferred to commercial ships to Shanghai. These merchants suffered heavy losses in their luggage and belongings when they set off. They arrived in Shen at 4:30 pm the day before yesterday and were in a state of embarrassment. Most of them were from Zhejiang Province and have now returned to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Tax exemption for silk fabrics The Jianghai Customs previously received instructions from the Ministry of Finance to exempt export of domestic silk from taxes as an incentive. Since its implementation, the export of Chinese silk has seen a noticeable improvement. Now the customs has received another order from the ministry that export of domestic silk, in addition to No. 180 to No. 184, is exempt from tax. Now export tax form No. 186 silk floss, No. 199 silk yarn and silk thread, No. 212 pure silk and mixed silk clothes, and clothing parts, etc., and No. 213 part of the textiles not listed, etc., are also exempt from export tax. Yesterday, a notice was issued to inform all exporters. Postal workers arrive in the Northeast again Postal workers have successively come south in many batches.

Yi Peiji's statement on the disposal of cultural relics in the Forbidden City</p>
<p>Reply to the Professors' Association of Shanghai University</p>
<p>Stating that they are items that are not related to culture</p>
<p>Wang Zaoshi, Zhang Yi, and Xie Xunchu, the executive directors of the Shanghai University Professors' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, sent a letter to Yi Peiji, the director of the Beiping Palace Museum, for the alleged sale of antiques in the Beiping Palace Museum, announcing the truth. Yi stated that many of the rumors outside were untrue, and specially replied to Wang Zhang et al. to clarify the truth. The original text is attached below. I am replying directly because I have received your letter and I understand everything. Recently, there have been many untrue rumors in the newspapers about the sale of antiques by our museum. I would like to briefly explain to you. Our museum once disposed of items that were not related to culture and history. This was decided by the council of our museum at a meeting in Beijing on April 10, 18, and approved by the Executive Yuan Order No. 144 on May 6. Our museum implemented it. At that time, the Forbidden City was being reorganized in every aspect, and there was no time to consider it. It was not until June 20 that we followed the government's order to organize a time supervision committee consisting of representatives from the Beiping District Court, the Tianjin Garrison Command, the Beiping Municipal Government, the Beiping University, and the council of our museum to gradually implement it. The items disposed of included tea, medicinal materials, fur, snuff, silk, ham legs, damaged seaweed, cosmetics, honey, etc. All of them have been carefully reviewed by the committee and confirmed to be items that are not related to culture and history and cannot be permanently preserved. There are records in the museum that can be checked. There are no antiques at all. Peiji is in charge of the museum's affairs and maintains and protects it, and dares not fall behind others. Your concern for culture is highly admired. I hope you will give me advice from time to time. I am very fortunate to attach a booklet on the overview of the disposal of items that are not related to culture and history. The Tanggong Association sends a letter of thanks to the Ministry of Railways for subsidizing construction funds</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Tanggong Rehabilitation Committee yesterday sent a letter to Minister Gu and Vice Minister Zeng of the Ministry of Railways, saying, "Minister Mengyu and Vice Minister Zhongming, Jian, the ministry has subsidized the Jiangnan Seawall Rehabilitation Project with 150,000 yuan. The funds have been received in full. Seeing the ministry's embrace of the people's suffering, we are deeply grateful. With this great gift from the committee, all the completed projects can be completed with effort. From then on, the farmers will be safe in the fields, and the merchants will be safe in the market, all thanks to the benevolence of the sages. However, there are still many dangerous seawalls. How to raise huge funds and design construction in the future is still a matter of asking the gentleman to promote the great ambition of construction and give assistance from time to time. I respectfully send this letter to express my thanks and wish you well." It also sent a letter of thanks to Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Conference, with similar words and meanings.

<p>The plague is rampant in various counties in southern Jin.

The Chongqing Chamber of Commerce replied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce that the Sichuan merchants have implemented the abolition of taels</p>
<p>It started on October 19th</p>
<p>Six articles of regulations can be used for reference</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously sent a letter to the chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities to solicit opinions on the implementation of the abolition of taels and the conversion to yuan by the Ministry of Finance, and received replies from various places. Now the chamber has also received a letter from the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce in Sichuan, stating that Sichuan Province had already implemented the abolition of taels, and attached six articles of regulations that can be used for reference when Shanghai implements it in the future. The letter said: "The case has been approved. The telegram from your chamber inquired about the abolition of taels and the conversion to yuan. Our chamber received instructions from the Sichuan Southeast Industry and Commerce Consolidation Committee in August of the 19th year of the Republic of China, General Order No. 25, stating that taels should be converted to yuan to maintain the currency system and show unification, etc. Upon receiving this, our chamber immediately convened various trade associations in the city for detailed discussions, and finally decided on several articles of regulations, which are copied separately below. The commercial firms in our city immediately implemented the regulations on schedule. The foregoing is hereby replied to your chamber for your reference and to strengthen public friendship." The regulations are as follows: (1) From October 1st of this year, all kinds of bills established by merchants in Chongqing must be changed from taels to yuan in the amount stated on them; (2) When converting from taels to yuan, each silver yuan will still be calculated at seven qian and one fen of Ping Sheng silver, as usual; (3) The amount recorded in the account books established by various commercial firms will be changed from taels to yuan successively from October, and must be completely changed by December 31, 19th, in order to implement the inspection on January 1, 20th; (4) The amount delivered from Chongqing to other places will be stated in the currency commonly used in those places, and the registration in Chongqing will still be recorded in yuan. The amount remitted from other places to Chongqing will still be recorded in yuan, regardless of how it is stated on the bill; (5) Various discount regulations in Chongqing will be handled as usual without any change, but they must not interfere with the case of converting from taels to yuan. All bills and account books must be changed from taels to yuan in the number recorded; (6) The resolutions of various items will be forwarded by the chamber of commerce to the Sichuan Southeast Industry and Commerce Consolidation Committee for approval, and then notified to the various gangs to follow. Method of sending black mail</p>
<p>In Heilongjiang Province, the postal rights of six places, including Daheihe, are still under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Post Office and have not fallen into Chinese hands. Except for parcels, the other mail sent by the six bureaus is collected and sent as usual. It is learned that the Directorate General of Posts, in order to facilitate transportation, has consulted with the Moscow Soviet Russian Postal Authority and formulated a method of sending mail, which is ordered to be followed by the various bureaus. The method is specifically extracted as follows: "It is found that the Heihe Postal District and the Heilongjiang River coast are under the jurisdiction of the officials in Daheihe, Aihun, and Qiming. The post offices in Daheihe, Aihun, Qike, Wuyun, Jinshan Town, and Mohe, although parcel and remittance services have been suspended, can still be maintained as usual. Now, the Directorate General and the Moscow Soviet Russian Postal Authority have negotiated the method of exchanging mail between the Daheihe Chinese Post Office and Hailanpao. The two places are both on the Bin of the Heilongjiang River, separated by only one water. In the future, all mail sent from the above-mentioned places, except for mail sent to various places along the Heilongjiang River and Soviet Russian places, will be directly sealed by the Daheihe Post Office to Shanghai, with the words "via Vladivostok and delivered to Shanghai ships at that place" marked on the bag. All ordinary and registered mail sent from the mainland of China to various places along the Heilongjiang River should be scattered and sent to the Shanghai Post Office, which will seal the general bag and send it to the Daheihe bag. The Chinese and Russian words "Received by the Daheihe Chinese Post Office, transferred by Vladivostok and Hailanpao" should be marked on the bag, and the Shanghai Post Office will send it to Vladivostok by direct ship." Postal workers' unions in various places telegraphed the Postal Economic Research Association</p>
<p>Request to study and consolidate the postal plan as soon as possible</p>
<p>Postal</p>
<p>The Postal System Research Committee has been established for nearly three months</p>
<p>As for the implementation method of the plan to consolidate the postal base, there is still no</p>
<p>Practical research postal workers' unions in various places</p>
<p>Hoping that the plan will be implemented as soon as possible, they have telegraphed the association for days, requesting to proceed as soon as possible and end the meeting within a time limit</p>
<p>The telegrams from the postal workers' unions in Hangzhou, Hankou, Hangzhou, etc. are as follows: (1) Suzhou Postal Workers' Union (omitted above) Since the establishment of the Lake Zi Jun Association, it has been more than a bright moon. I only heard the form of meetings but did not see concrete resolutions. Recalling the original intention of the gentlemen to mediate the postal tide was to maintain the good intentions of the postal base. Postal workers all over the country also believe that the gentlemen are worthy of the times and trust them very much. However, as time goes by, they are perfunctory. I am deeply afraid that this will continue and I will not be able to comfort the postal workers' hopes. In case a second storm is brewing, I would like to ask the gentlemen how they will explain to the people of the country. I earnestly request the association not to change its original intention, to overcome constraints, and to promote the prosperity of the postal service as the premise and to build the country as the goal. I hope that the consolidation plan will be adopted and implemented within a time limit. This is what our association is praying for. (omitted below) (2) Hankou Postal Workers' Union, (omitted above) The establishment of your association was originally to discuss the implementation method of the postal base consolidation plan. The responsibility is heavy. It is reasonable to make a fair decision as soon as possible and forward it for implementation, so as not to live up to the government's principle of receiving the intention. However, after several months of procrastination, no agreement has been reached. Recently, the situation has deteriorated and the news has spread, causing panic among the people. After checking, the above-mentioned plan was formulated by postal workers with decades of experience and careful consideration. We sincerely request your association to make a decision as soon as possible so that it can be implemented and comfort the public. If there is a bias and other attempts, then the final strength of our postal workers across the country is still there, and we must fight to the end. If we are forced to do so, we will not hesitate to make any sacrifices. We earnestly express our words and hope that you will understand. (omitted below) (3) Zhejiang Postal Workers' Federation, (omitted above) Your association has been established for two months, and I have not heard of any clues to the problems to be resolved. Now it has been suspended indefinitely. We firmly support the postal base plan, and all postal workers who are indifferent to management cannot sit idly by and know that the gentlemen are worthy of the times. We must not make the solution at the time of the mediation on May 26 an empty promise. This is a big problem. When can it be resolved? When can the postal base plan be implemented? The responsibility lies with you, and you must have something to tell our colleagues. Lin Dian is overwhelmed with expectations. (omitted below) Donations to the Northeast Volunteer Army Yesterday's news</p>
<p>Ten-year-old Yi Zhu Derong enthusiastically donated to the Northeast Volunteer Army</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received notifications from various donation collection offices yesterday that donations are still strong. However, ten-year-old Zhu Derong also knows how to save the country and generously donated 50 yuan, which is commendable. The details are as follows: Shanghai Xinhua Bank collected 250 yuan donated by the Rugao County Anti-Japanese Association and the Provincial Anti-Japanese Association, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce collected 2 yuan donated by Qiu Qifa, 3 yuan donated by Qian Zhaoxiang, 2 yuan donated by Xu Xiquan, 20 yuan donated by Zhu Wenqi, 20 yuan donated by Zhu Quanji, 2 yuan donated by Ding Kang, 5 yuan donated by Gong Ji, 50 yuan donated by Zhu Zhichao, 20 yuan donated by the colleagues of the Relief Women and Children Association's Nursing Home, 50 yuan donated by Xin An Yimin, 4 yuan donated by the Zhabei Shihua Factory, 3 yuan and 74 cents donated by the workers of the Zhabei Shihua Factory, 2 yuan donated by an anonymous person, 6 yuan donated by Chen Shuguo, 4 yuan donated by Chen Lizhi, 273 yuan and 70 cents donated by the colleagues of the Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau, 10 yuan donated by Gu Chengmin, 10 yuan donated by Wu Xiangmiao, Wu Chunmiao, Wu Xushi, Liu Chenshi, and Wang Tans, 20 yuan donated by the Nanjing Zhejiang Industrial Bank Club, 50 yuan donated by Zhu Derong, an upper-aged child, collected by the Shanghai Taiping Bank, 40 yuan donated by Qin Ren, collected by the Shanghai Kenye Bank. The Special Zone Stamp Tax Office advises stores to affix stamps</p>
<p>Jiang Zishu, the director of the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, and Liang Jiaqian, the deputy director, have been actively consolidating the stamp tax in the concession since taking office, sparing no effort. Now they advise the stores in a document saying, "Notice: The stamp tax in the concession has been in place for four years. The large and small stores in the concession all know that the stamp tax is a national tax and is followed by the whole country, so they affix stamps to invoices, account books, receipts, and all kinds of paper that can be used as vouchers. This is the result of the effective guidance of the directors in the past, and it is also a sign of your businesses' respect for the national tax and love for the country, which is very admirable. However, recently, a small number of stores use various deformed and disguised notes to record numbers and notices, etc., instead of invoices, hoping to avoid affixing stamps. They think that this behavior is very clever and they can avoid affixing stamps. In fact, it is a big mistake. You should know that no matter what kind of invoice a store issues, as long as it is given to the customer with the goods, listing the name of the goods or the value is more than one yuan, it should be affixed with a stamp of one cent. This has been explained by the Ministry of Finance. If it is found out and sent to the court, it will be severely punished. There is also a kind of store that does not issue invoices, which is even more unreasonable. An invoice is a voucher for buying and selling goods and also has the effect of advertising. Because the invoice is circulating outside, it spreads from one to ten and from ten to a hundred. When people see the invoice, they have this store in their minds. If they do not issue invoices, no one will know this store. Even if the goods are good, I am afraid that no one will care about it and the business will be bleak. Don't you see the Yong'an, Sincere, and New New companies? When you buy goods from them, there is no invoice that is not issued, so it circulates everywhere and the business is getting bigger and bigger, and there is no one that is not affixed with a stamp. His office is precise and his actions are generous, which is even more worthy of our admiration. You can know that the more stamps you affix, the bigger the business is, and the fewer stamps you affix, the smaller the business is. This is a definite truth. As for the annual stamp of one dime per piece for ledgers and account books, this is stated in the regulations. Recently, some people are greedy for small profits, some are missing stamps, and some are affixing two or four cents, which is less than the required amount. Once someone reports it or the court searches it, they still have to affix the stamps and will be severely punished. Now I advise the merchants in the concession to affix stamps in accordance with the regulations everywhere and not to have any侥倖心 to avoid regret. The purpose of this office in handling the stamp tax in the special zone is to not disturb the people first. The salesmen sent are all trained repeatedly and ordered to make peaceful contact and not to cause trouble. I hope that our merchants will also treat them with a peaceful and honest attitude. If there are extortion or scammers who pretend to be scammers, please come to the office to report them by name so that they can be thoroughly investigated. For this reason, a clear notice is issued, hoping that everyone will abide by it."</p>

<p>Local News Two brothers commit suicide by poisoning The elder brother is dead and the younger brother is dying Due to the disturbance of the Communist bandits, the family was destroyed and the people died. They came to Shanghai to do business and were stolen by thieves. They were homeless and helpless and took this last resort. Cai Biyou from Nanxiong, Guangdong, is 30 years old this year. Cai Bixin is 28 years old this year. The two brothers used to be in the foreign goods business. Because their hometown was disturbed by Communist bandits, their property was almost completely lost. They raised funds to come to Shanghai to do business. Unexpectedly, their fate was bad and they were stolen by thieves. Hundreds of gold were stolen, causing the Cai brothers to be in Shanghai. Because they had no funds to do business and were homeless, they suddenly had short-sighted thoughts. The two brothers were willing to live and die together, so they bought two small tin boxes of raw opium from a foreigner for one yuan the day before yesterday afternoon. The two of them then went to Room 24 of the Zhonghua Hotel at No. 68 Baoyu Lane, Edouard Road, French Concession, at 4 pm to stay overnight. They divided the raw opium and ate it, and went to bed to die. It was not until 6 pm yesterday that the tea room Lu Caisheng saw that the Cai brothers had been motionless all day. He knocked on the door and called but there was no response. He pushed the door open and found that Biyou had died in bed, and Bixin was dying and could not speak. There were traces of opium and opium boxes in the teacups on the bedside table. Knowing that it was poisoning, he immediately reported to the police station and sent Bixin to Renji Hospital for treatment. Biyou's body was sent by the police station to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for autopsy, waiting for the Second Special Court to send personnel to inspect it today. The detective found a small piece of paper written in pencil by the deceased in the stack, recounting that his hometown was disturbed by bandits and he came to Shanghai to do business, and was stolen by thieves. Because he was homeless, the brothers committed suicide at the same time. From the situation he described, the tragic situation and the disturbance caused by the Communist bandits can be imagined. The workers' strike in Xu Chongdao yesterday's news Dagong News Agency said that after all the employees of the general branch of Xu Chongdao National Medicine Store announced a strike, although the Social Bureau ordered them to resume work within a time limit, the workers' attitude was tough and they refused to comply, resulting in a dangerous situation. The employer specially submitted a report to the Social Bureau yesterday, requesting approval to dismiss the striking employees. The details are as follows: Workers' meeting All workers of the Xu Chongdao Group held a conversation meeting yesterday morning and decided: (1) The Social Bureau ordered to resume work, but Zheng was indeed framed, so it was difficult to accept; (2) Request economic assistance from the union; (3) Send representatives to negotiate directly with the employer together with the union representatives; (4) All workers must stay in the store to prevent the store from recruiting new workers; (Omitted below) Postponement of the re-election The Pharmaceutical Industry Union originally scheduled to hold a city-wide conference on the 8th to re-elect directors and supervisors. The Municipal Party Department believed that the Xu Chongdao dispute had not been resolved at the conference, and there was a risk of a general strike, so it specially approved the postponement. After receiving the order, the union immediately notified all members, saying, "Notice: The Municipal Executive Committee Order No. 2061 states, "I have learned that the voting for the re-election will be held on the 6th and 7th of this month. Please postpone the members' conference to the 22nd and seal the ballot boxes tightly after the voting is over, and submit them to the meeting for safekeeping to be careful." After receiving this order, the union should comply with it and change the date of the conference to 1:00 pm on the 22nd of this month. I am afraid that the members will not understand the truth and will have to work hard to travel back and forth, so I am in a hurry to notify you. Please note, this is a special notice." Employer's report Report for the employees to violate the law and disobey the order, and it is difficult to control them. Please approve all dismissals to maintain discipline and maintain political order. I belong to the company's entire employees, who took this opportunity to coerce, strike illegally, and endanger the store's business, society, and people's livelihood. I was kindly and severely judged by your bureau, ordering the employees to return to work at the store before the 5th and deducting wages for the strike period to show a slight punishment. I admire the thunderous order very much. However, after receiving the order, the employees not only refused to return to work, but also stepped up their efforts, continuously instigating reactionary personnel and inciting pharmaceutical workers in various districts, and there were secret plans for a general strike in the pharmaceutical industry in the city. The situation became more and more dangerous, and they intended to use the power of the masses to put pressure on the government. Such bold and reckless behavior clearly showed that they had other backgrounds. Under this environment, I was exhausted and could not maintain it. In order to survive the fate of the store, I had to take decisive measures, so I decided to dismiss all the employees who violated the law and disob</p>

<p>Business News: Gold Bar Market Experiences Another Slight Dip</p>
<p>The gold bar market experienced a winding process yesterday, with frequent fluctuations of three to four taels. The total difference throughout the day amounted to seven taels, yet it proved exceedingly difficult to break through the 700-tael mark. Consequently, the price fell again by more than two taels, leaving industry players in a state of uncertainty. The market opened relatively stable, with no activity from the Bank of America. Although the Bank of England continued to rise, sellers were not idle, leading to a softening of the market. Subsequently, signs of weakness emerged as the exchange rate became loose and excessive. Later, the Central Bank actively injected over one thousand taels of spot gold, while various firms such as Da De Cheng, Tai Feng Run, Tong Feng, Yong Ying Feng, and Huan, engaged in spread trading of forward contracts. Additionally, due to the apparent stabilization of foreign exchange rates, the price briefly touched 700 taels. However, it struggled to break through this level, prompting sellers to seize the opportunity to offload their holdings, resulting in a downward trend. Subsequently, the exchange rate weakened further as major players engaged in heavy selling, causing a rapid decline to 693 taels and change. Afterward, there was a rebound of three taels, reaching around 97 taels. However, the volatile nature of the market made it difficult to take action. The overall market situation is detailed below.</p>
<p>Difficult to Break Through the 700-Tael Mark: The October forward contract opened at 699.5 taels, an increase of one tael. Large bars also rose by three-sixteenths, but this did not cause much movement. There was no telegraphic transfer activity from the Bank of America. The exchange rates for British and American currencies rose slightly. There was no market for American and British currencies. However, Yuan Heng and others took the lead, followed by 9 taels and 8 qian. Subsequently, there was a gain of one tael and change. Later, the selling pressure from firms such as Fu Chang Heng, Yu Fu, Yu Yi, Feng Yong Xie Xing, Yong Ri Chang, Da Xing, Yong Yuan, Kang Xiang, and Fu Shun became significant, causing a rise of more than four taels. The initial price for American dollars in the current month was 56.25. Later, the December contract was absorbed by Shanghai by 1.25, while Anda simultaneously sold. By 9:30 AM, the price reached 95.8 taels. The British gold was quoted higher by 1.25, and American dollars by 0.25, then slightly lower to 95.3 taels. At this time, the December American dollar contract was available for both buying and selling at 1.875. Soon after, Anda absorbed 1.875. Huabi absorbed the November British gold contract at 10 pence 0.625. The Central Bank then injected 210 bars of spot gold, and firms such as Zhi Feng, Yong Heng Chang, Yong Da Xing, and Yong Fu Tai Heng all entered the market, causing an immediate rebound of one tael, reaching 96.6 taels. The price then slightly decreased to 96 taels. However, firms such as Da De Cheng, Ying Feng, Heng Tong Feng, and Yong sold more than 800 bars of Central Bank cash gold, while simultaneously engaging in spread trading of the October contracts. At the same time, Tong Tai Chang, Zhao Feng, Chang Yi Feng, Yong Yuan Tai, Yuan Heng, Heng Yu, Fu Shun, Fu Yu, Da Xing, Yong Wan Xing, etc., made efforts to acquire gold. Huabi absorbed the December American dollar contract at 0.625. Citibank and Zheng Jin engaged in counterparty trading for the current month at 5.625, causing the gold price to jump four taels. The intra-day spread, however, was limited to just a few qian. By 10:40 AM, the price reached 700 taels, a fleeting moment, before reversing downwards. HSBC then sold the October American dollar contract at 75. Yuan Xing, Yong Zhi Feng, Yong Tong, Tai Chang, Yi Feng, Yong Yuan Tai, Zhao Feng, and Chang all sold. By 11:20 AM, the price reached 96 taels. After that, Yu He, Hong Kang, Yong Tong Feng, Heng, Heng Yu, Yuan Mao, and Yong all entered the market. HSBC absorbed the December American dollar contract at 1.25. After a little over ten minutes, the price rose to 98.2 taels. Wheat firms sold December contracts at 0.0625, but 1.25 was difficult to offload. The market closed at 96.7 taels at noon.</p>
<p>Unstable Market Post-Lunch: The market initially opened at 96.5 taels, then fell frequently by 3 taels due to Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, Fu Shun, Zhao Feng Chang, Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Yu Heng Yu, etc. leaning towards selling. Further, HSBC sold December American dollars at 1.875 and British gold at 1.25, and bought American dollars at 3.125, causing a drop of more than 3 taels. Around 2:30 PM, the price was at 93.2 taels. Then, September contracts were traded against 31.75. Zhongfu and HSBC absorbed December contracts at 3.125 to 2.5. Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, Bing Xing, Wan Xing, Heng Yu, and Zhao Feng Chang then entered the market, causing an increase of more than 2 taels. At 3:15 PM, the price was at 96 taels. Heng Yu, Fu Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, and Yong Feng sold, and the October American dollar contract could be settled at 8.75. At 3:30 PM, the price receded to 4.2 taels, then fluctuated between 1 tael and 8.7 qian. Firms such as Da De Cheng purchased spot contracts, while Heng Yu bought and then sold.

The largest price for the day was 700 taels, and the smallest price was 693.2 taels, a difference of 6 taels and 8 qian. Bare bars increased by 9.5 taels.</p>
<p>Reduced Premium by Three Taels: The listed price was changed to 768 taels due to the American dollar being quoted higher by 0.25, resulting in a premium of 72.3 taels to 70 taels. In the afternoon, it was 71.2 taels to 75 taels, then recalculated to 72 taels, a premium reduced by three taels compared to the previous day. The registered price was 97 taels, with a margin call of 97 taels. In the afternoon, it was 96 taels.</p>

In the afternoon, various factories purchased a significant amount of Chinese cotton. Even Yao Hua cotton had sales of over 5,000 bales. In addition to Japanese factories, high prices of foreign cotton also led to purchases of domestic cotton. Although one manufacturer continued to sell heavily, Yong An Factory absorbed a large quantity and exclusively acquired 5,400 dan of October contracts, preparing for delivery. In general, the price difference between Chinese cotton and foreign cotton is too large (American cotton is priced at 38 taels locally, plus 7 taels for water tax in Shanghai). Alternatively, the domestic harvest may be abundant, with shipments pouring in, leading to a tendency to sell short and not be controlled by American cotton.</p>

<p>Stronger Buying Interest in Flour Futures:</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the contracts for various months were generally stable. Due to the closure of foreign wheat markets and lack of price quotations, there was little activity for the buying and selling of contracts for various months, resulting in few transactions and a sluggish market. However, after the market opened in the afternoon, sentiment suddenly turned bullish. According to reports from foreign firms, the American cooperatives were unwilling to sell the wheat they had previously acquired and would wait until March of next year to make a decision. As a result, people generally believed that foreign wheat would be difficult to import into China, and manufacturers would find it difficult to sell. This led to a surge in buying interest, and prices rose steadily for both near-term and distant contracts. Consequently, the price for the current month rose by 2 fen compared to the previous day, October rose by 1 fen 7.5 li, November rose by 2 fen, December rose by 1 fen 7.5 li, January rose by 1 fen 2.5 li, and February rose by 1 fen 5 li.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Market: Weak at First, Strong Later</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was initially weak but then strengthened. Although there were no price quotations for foreign wheat, people generally speculated that the sluggishness of the flour market and the expiration of contracts for market participants led to spot sales, naturally dampening buying interest. From the morning to the opening of the afternoon market, contracts for various months fell by 2-3 fen. After the second session, due to the sudden improvement in the flour market and rumors of changes in the overseas wheat market, market sentiment became slightly more active. However, whether this information is accurate remains to be confirmed. As a result, the price for the current month was unchanged, October and November rose by 1 fen, December rose by 2 fen, and February rose by 3 fen. The spot wheat market was slightly more active. High-quality Suqian wheat opened at 3 taels, 5 qian, and 7 fen, Mingguang wheat opened at 3 taels, 4 qian, and 7 fen, Yangzhou wheat opened at 3 taels, 4 qian, and Anting wheat opened at 3 taels, 3 qian, and 7 fen, with an estimated volume of 1,000 bags.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Jianbing Inventory Low, Price Trend Turns Upward</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended somewhat sluggish as the Dutch exchange rate weakened (listed at 78 guilders) and gold bar prices declined. The trend in Liu Pan's market was slightly sluggish. Although the listed price for grade 24 coarse white sugar was 14.4 taels, buyers were only willing to pay 14.35 taels, resulting in no transactions due to the standoff between the two sides. Grade 18 medium white sugar was traded at 13.75 taels, slightly lower than the previous day. However, sales of coarse white sugar have been relatively good recently. The past week has been the strongest since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, with a total of 48,000 bags sold. Therefore, based on the strong demand, the market is not expected to loosen too much in the future. Some Guangdong firms listed several dozen packages of brick sugar at prices of 9.23 taels. Jianbang firms listed 20 boxes of Taiyuan ice at a price of 10.02 taels per zhu, an increase of 3 qian compared to the previous day. Jianbing's inventory is visibly low, and the high cost of raw materials makes ice production difficult to be profitable. Therefore, there have been no imports from Xiamen recently. With the upcoming autumn sales season, the market is bound to tighten.</p>
<p>Goods such as Almonds and Glutinous Rice Branches in Zhabei Have Increased in Price:</p>
<p>Almonds, since the new crop came out, had once declined in price. Recently, due to rebounding land prices and brisk sales from various regions, market prices have risen accordingly. Yesterday, the market price for Baiyu almonds opened at 74-75 taels, Beishan almonds opened at around 50 taels, and Jiudaoju almonds opened at 40 taels. The market appeared tight. Supplies of glutinous rice branches have been scarce recently. After land prices rebounded, they have exceeded prices in Shanghai. After rising to 71 taels here, there have been few new shipments. Yesterday, it was reported that a Hong Kong firm in Nanshi had a batch of boxed rice branches, and while the quality was good, they had not been opened for sale due to the prices being mismatched. The market price for good-quality goods was 74-75 taels, and the market was firm.</p>
<p>Coal Market: Hongqi Coal Slurry Sales Are Unusually Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was a considerable amount of Hongqi coal slurry being traded in the market. Suzhou firms, in particular, had strong demand, with a total purchase volume of over 210 tons. The price increased from 9.5 taels to 9.8 taels. Various townships in Shanghai and Pudong also purchased over 170 tons at a price that was 5 fen lower. Other types of coal, such as Fengtian, Shanxi, and Indian Mack, remained unchanged, and market prices did not rise or fall.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: White Filature Sustained Firmness</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market at foreign firms in Shanghai was quite lively. White filature was in short supply of raw materials, and the market was increasingly firm. Jardine Matheson, Sin Fook, Dazhang, and others sold San Tiao Wu, Yue Tu, Tian Long, and SF brands of Shanghai white filature, with 13-15 filament grades at prices ranging from 675 taels to 705 taels. Samsung and others sold Gong Ma, Jin Ma Si, and other brands of Qi Li Gan Da Jing, with 25 bundles at a price of 410 taels.</p>
<p>Jiaxing Autumn Silkworms Begin Mounting Frames in Large Numbers:</p>
<p>Early silkworm cocoons are appearing.</p>
<p>The cocoons are still of good quality.</p>
<p>In various cities and towns north and south of Jiaxing, farmers this year are using improved breeds distributed by government offices, and there are supervisors making rounds to provide guidance. As a result, losses from wind and rain damage have been minimal. However, the price of leaves is earlier, and silkworm rearing is not cheap. Early silkworm cocoons are appearing, and the cocoons are still of good quality. The second batch of silkworm eggs are beginning to mount the frames in large numbers, and the late batches only have abundant leaves. The autumn silkworm season this year is expected to last over ten days longer.</p>

<h3>What We Wish to Suggest to Minister Ariyoshi</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Japanese Minister to China, Mr. Akira Ariyoshi, arrived in Shanghai one day before the League of Nations Investigative Mission led by Lord Lytton and others departed from China. He is scheduled to go to Beijing today. This newly arrived minister, along with his activities in Beijing and Shanghai four months prior and his decade-long diplomatic achievements as Consul General in Shanghai, are well-known to the Chinese people and need no introduction to understand what kind of person he is. Japanese commentators believe that exchanging Chiang Tso-pin to Japan and Ariyoshi to China is a good representation for both countries and they expect a landmark of brightness for the future of the two countries. Today, we do not want to discuss whether these representatives are good or bad, nor do we dare to look forward to this landmark of brightness. However, since Mr. Ariyoshi has come with the consent of our government and with the status of Minister, we should express the necessary respect to him and wish to discuss with him the issues that should be noted in his mission.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Japanese Diplomatic Times, in an article bidding farewell to Minister Ariyoshi, hoped that he would "hold his position with a mind bathed in hot water, and then come up with effective measures after the hot water has cooled." In a conversation with a reporter from the North China Daily News, Mr. Ariyoshi also expressed that after taking office, he initially planned to study the current state of affairs in detail. We believe that the hope of this Japanese diplomatic commentator and the wait-and-see attitude expressed by Mr. Ariyoshi are quite necessary in the current Sino-Japanese diplomatic environment. However, we believe that during this waiting period, Mr. Ariyoshi should not prepare so-called effective measures, but should carefully observe the situation in China and contribute what he has learned to the heads of Kasumigaseki (Japanese Foreign Ministry) to improve Japan's foreign policy. For example, the issue of direct negotiations. The reporter from the Diplomatic Times believed that "if China had outstanding politicians who withdrew the proposal from the League of Nations and adopted an attitude of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, the outstanding issues between the two countries could be resolved overnight." However, under the current situation where the territory is being occupied and the Japanese side is loudly proclaiming the recognition of rebellion, the Chinese people are unanimously indignant and jointly seeking to recover the country's territory. If Mr. Ariyoshi has a little more time, he should be able to understand whether this is possible. Can Mr. Ariyoshi suggest to his Kasumigaseki leaders to find ways to change the aggressive behavior of the warlords? If he can, then his wait-and-see attitude is not in vain, and there is no better effective measure than this.</p>
<p>In his published remarks, Mr. Ariyoshi expressed his willingness to do his best to restore the friendly relations between China and Japan as before and to establish East Asian peace based on the coexistence and co-prosperity of the two countries. This is the Japanese-style diplomatic rhetoric that we often hear. However, his subsequent statement that "friendly relations between the two countries can only be realized by fully understanding each other's position and fully cooperating with each other's needs" clearly shows the color of the Uchida-style Asian Monroe Doctrine. The Uchida-style Asian Monroe Doctrine is vehemently opposed by the Chinese people and hinders the restoration of Sino-Japanese relations. If Mr. Ariyoshi has a little more time, he should also be able to understand this. Can Mr. Ariyoshi suggest to Foreign Minister Uchida to change his outdated doctrine? According to Japanese magazines, Mr. Ariyoshi's mission to China is an act especially recognized by Foreign Minister Uchida. Therefore, Mr. Ariyoshi should have the obligation to contribute his opinions to Uchida and make him adopt a more timely attitude.</p>
<p>Under the current state between China and Japan, diplomacy cannot even be discussed. Because Minister Ariyoshi has had a long relationship with the Chinese revolution and is now being sent to China at a time of extreme tension in Sino-Japanese relations, we reluctantly express our expectations. Can Mr. Ariyoshi further convey the Chinese people's psychology towards Japan to the Japanese government and the public to prevent the Japanese government from recognizing the rebellion? Since Mr. Ariyoshi is willing to do his best to restore the friendly relations between China and Japan as before, this issue is the prerequisite for restoring friendly relations. Can Mr. Ariyoshi work hard to achieve this? However, it is generally known that the Japanese government's decision to recognize the rebellion is like an arrow on a drawn bow and cannot be stopped. Therefore, our hope is the same as the reporter from the Japanese Diplomatic Times who hoped that China would withdraw the proposal from the League of Nations, and we are clearly aware that it is impossible. So what plans does Mr. Ariyoshi have to deal with the aftermath?</p>

<h3>Zheng Jicheng is Detained in Military Court</h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Donates 300,000 for Zhang Zongchang's Funeral</p>
<p>(Beiping) Cheng Xixian said that before Zhang Zongchang went to Jinan, he telegraphed Han Fuju. Han disapproved of the rumors in the north, but it was inconvenient to say so. Both when Zhang arrived in Jinan and when he left, he sent him to pick him up and drop him off. Han also hosted Zhang for a banquet and had a good chat. He never expected that he would suffer such misfortune. The details of Zhang's death have been reported in great detail. Zhang Shaotang telegraphed to Peiping, stating the circumstances after the assassin of Zhang was arrested, saying that the assassin Zheng Jicheng confessed that he was avenging his uncle.

<p>(Jinan) Zhang Weicun, the commissioner of the provincial reorganization committee, telegraphed to Commander Chiang of Jinghan (Beijing-Hankou) and other important figures regarding the Zheng assassination of Zhang case, saying that although this case was a personal killing, Zhang had harmed Shandong Province in the past, and the accumulated old grievances of the general public could be relieved by this. Zhang's death is not worth mentioning, but Zheng's revenge for his father is fighting for the dignity of the people of Shandong. Not only is filial piety enough to make people sympathize, but the principles for resolving the aftermath of this case should be considered between national law and human sentiment. The party members of this province also have this mentality, and the party headquarters of various counties have also telegraphed the provincial party headquarters, requesting that it be forwarded to the central government. The general idea is the same as Zhang's telegram, and the wording is even more intense. Zheng decided to send a telegram reporting the reasons for assassinating Zhang, saying that where there are traitors, the national law can punish them. What the national law misses, everyone can punish them. Moreover, local thieves and villains, the people of the place hate them to the bone. The enemy of the father is not to be lived under the same sky by the son or grandson. This is the case in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad. Zhang is not only not to be lived under the same sky by the Jicheng family, but also a national traitor and a public enemy of the locality. Jicheng has read poetry and books since childhood, and knows a little about the hatred of not living under the same sky. He has served in the military and knows a little about the great justice of eradicating evil. Therefore, he did not hesitate to sacrifice his life to eliminate the evil horse for the people, to vent public anger for the locality, and to fight for justice for the Zheng family. Where justice lies, he sacrificed his life for it. What is connected to the reputation of education, he is responsible for it, so that the world and future generations will know that national traitors should be punished, and local public enemies should be avenged. Also, to make those who are sons know that the father's enemy should not be lived under the same sky with them. There is no shortage of enlightened people in the world who know whether I am guilty. Awaiting judgment. Zheng also sent a letter to Zhang Qun, stating that the assassination of Zhang was a last resort for the country and for the individual. The provincial government asked the central government how to deal with Zheng, but there was no reply. It is estimated that Zheng will be sent to court first. (6th Special Telegram)</p>
