<h3 id="c1">我們要求民政治彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>記得汪精衛先生去年十一月七日在上海對各大學代表演説。中曾堅定决絕的説。「我們一定在以血去求民主政治的實現。以血去求民主政府之產出。」可是自從汪先生膺命行政院長以後。久矣我們不聽見「民主政治」的呼聲了。</p>
<p>然而「以血去求民主政治的實現。」在現在却正是人民一致的主張我們認爲要解除人民自身的桎梧。要求得打破當前的國難要求得我們民族光明的前路。除了立即實現民主政治而外。更無他法。</p>
<p>不過我們所要求的民主政治。不是「均權」的。民主不是「黨」的民主也不是現在西歐各國的「僞」民主。因爲那些根本都是虚僞的。是欺騙大多數人</p>
<p>民的一種更巧妙的説謊。我們所在求的是「眞」的民主政治。是以絕大多數人民爲基礎的民主政治。</p>
<p>我們認爲政治是人民公同的事。即應適合於人民的要求。假如政治而爲少數人所辦便足以禍害人民。與人民。的利益是日益背道而馳人</p>

<p>焦點全在日本撤兵期限</p>
<p>能否打開難關殊不可知</p>
<p>今日會議前途非常暗淡</p>
<p>停戰會議、自開始以來、迄已旬日、雖協定草案五條中、已有四條通過、然根本問題、撤兵時間與地點、就歷次討之情形、以及日軍部致白川訓令內容觀之、則會議前途、殊爲暗淡也、茲分誌所得消息如下、</p>

<p>日會議中、雙方對規定日軍完全撤兵時期之意見、相距甚遠、因由英使提議、昨休會一日、俾圖轉圜、昨日下午三時、英使並邀中日雙方代表·及在滬各國公使茶會、再向雙方調停、郭次長等表示、根據政府訓令及全國民意、日軍最後撤兵時期、無論如何、應於次會議中、明白規定、不能再行讓步、日方仍稱、須視届時之狀態而定、爭執焦點、終無接近之可能、至五時許散會、</p>

<p>我方停戰會議首席代表郭泰祺氏、昨在寓所接見華東社記者、郭氏對於中日停戰會議之前途、仍表示常悲觀、據郭氏談、停戰會議之重大焦點、厥在日方撤兵一點、連日對於此點、討論雖多、初無進步、當前日會議時、本人曾訽問日方代表、究竟認爲於何種情况之下、始能完全撤退日軍、俾恢復一月二十八日前之原防、當時日方代表、謂須在秩序完全恢復而後、當時本人、即以公共租界與法租界之取消戒嚴爲上海秩序業已恢復之明證、促日方從速撤退、惟日代表猶認爲不滿、而本人對於日代表之要求留駐閘北各區、曾確切聲明在現有狀態之下、閘北各區、急待復興、苟日軍而猶復駐在、將使人民以前之創痛與經騐、重復回憶故堅决聲明日軍須有一確切之時間、恢復一月二十八日前之原防、並表示日軍而苟無恢復一月二十八日前之確定日期、則其他一切談判、實等於零、蓋撤兵問題而不能解决、其他談判、雖經就緖、實屬無益也、記者當詢郭氏、關於吾方政府之態度、對於日兵撤退、有否規定日期、昨日日參謀部訓令白川、協定如果成立、一週內開始撤兵、六星期內完全撤退、至指定區域、此説是否會議中所規定、據郭氏談、會議中對於日軍開始撤退、係規定四星期撤至指定區域、一月內完全撤退至一月二十八日原防云云、</p>

<p>新聲社云、據參與會議之友邦人士觀察、以爲會議情形、雖因日政府致白川之訓令益形緊張、然亦不盡如此蓋渠之竟見、以爲新聞傳述之致白川訓令、不過係强國對弱國外交上之一種「示威」策略已、且日本於會議之前途、願否决裂、當亦顧慮其國內之政治情形與國際形勢也、渠對致白川訓令、雖不願有所批評、但一般人早已承認如訓令果屬事實、其中第三點、已明白表示有未來之軍事準備、（閘北江灣吳淞綫爲用兵作戰上之重要點等言、）預測國聯至必要時間、或將根據上述言論及談判、迄未入於第二項原則、而有所表示、亦未可知云云、</p>

<p>白鶴江位居黃渡之西、安亭之南、夾在吳淞江大盈江之間、形勢天然、此次淞滬防軍撤退時、該鎭居民、大起恐惶、遂相率逃避、即第八區公所及公安分局保衛團等機關、亦曾一度他遷、繼我軍扼守靑陽港後、該處遂無爭戰之必要、附近無防亦無防禦工程、始敢回鎭辦公、惟滬上曾有「大隊日步騎兵到白鶴江偵察」之謠傳、今詢諸地方人士之未出走者、均謂迄今尙未見敵踪云、</p>
<h3 id="c22">鄕師行李房被焚 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>黄渡鎭東市梢上海中學鄕邨師範、自去年寒假後、迄未開校、全校師生之行李、存儲在校者、有六七百件、均封鎖於一室、此次我軍退却、日軍即跟踪而至、遂致絲毫未及搬出、三月十二日上午九時許、日軍五六十名到鎭、强拉人民、伴之周游街市凡經過黨部學校等機關、必入內翻箱倒篋、搜查殆遍、見應用什物、則不論大小好歹、皆一律取去、繼至該校、見房內行李如山積、而門户封鎖甚緊、不易進去、乃由一形似軍官者、偕同十餘名、至街上取煤油八九箱、洒在四週及屋面上後、始放火焚燒、一刹那間、該屋竟成灰燼、記者於二十六日中午親至該校觀察、尙見新落成禮堂·總辦公室·及敎室·宿舍等、仍矗立於地平線上、外傳該校全部被焚、殊非事實、</p>
<h3 id="c23">搗毁中山紀念堂 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>黃渡鎭中山　　紀念堂、係將原有之嘉界城隍廟大殿改建而成、堂內外一切佈置、已粗具模型、今次日軍到來、初祇七八人、第二次五六十人、除燒去鄕師行李房一所外、其他未有動作、距十六日後、忽來忽去、十分忙碌、且來必損壞公私建築、乃回至車站、十七日傍晚、又來日軍二三十人、及白俄十餘人、到鎭後即至該堂、將一切器具什物、和設在堂裏之保衛團團部、公安分駐所、區黨部、區公所、及中山紀念堂後身之嘉黃小學等各機關文件、均搗毁一空、並搬至堂前大塲上、架火焚化、</p>

<p>三月二十三　　日淸晨、有米船四五艘、從西首重固白鶴江開來、行經黃渡千秋橋附近、突來日兵及漢奸一羣、先放朝天槍一排示威、迫令停靠該處之招商輪埠、以便檢查、該船船子見來勢洶洶、不敢違抗、遂聽彼指揮、逞其所爲、距該船停靠未曅、即有漢奸及鎭上地痞流氓等、相繼下船、搬取袋米、爭先恐後、絡繹不絕、幸在後數船、見前車已覆、不敢冒險前進、遂一齊向後轉回</p>
<p>去、聞該船損失、計白米四十五担、現洋</p>
<p>十一元云、</p>

<p>南翔自被日軍估據後、各項商店、前以日機時來擲彈、故早已關門他遷、乃日軍因採辦軍食、及一切雜用物品、殊多不便、遂分頭勸導回去開市、一面另由江北漢奸、到無人顧問之店、做臨時主人翁、開門營業、但日兵强暴性成、毫不講理、購置各種物品、均非現銀、而以購物證爲憑、凡此物價值一元者、至多塡六角爲限、每逢日矅、始發出佈告、於星期一上午八時至十時內、持購物證前往指揮部、領取現欵、但證上塡銀十元者、則給國幣四元、日洋四元、如均要國幣、則四元換二元五角國幣、若稍有詢問、即拳足交加、故一輩從前未走之商人、及被同業招回者、現已相率逃避、不得不仍以閉門羹對付之云、</p>

<p>— 徵</p>
<p>上交，我拿綠氣介紹諸位了，因爲綠氣這一種元素極歡喜交朋友，所以他能與許多物質化合起來。現在我所説的，就是綠氣同一種殛素輕氣化合起來，變化成一種新的物質，就呌氯化氫（ＨｙｄｃｏｇｅｎＣｈｌｏｄｅ）他的符號是ＨＣＩ</p>
<p>巧得很，我們製造他時須用的器具與做綠氣用的完用相同·也是祗要一只火酒燈；一只大口燒瓶；一個像皮管塞，須鑽兩個洞的；一只長頸漏斗；一根雙彎曲的玻璃管，此種管又可呌Ｕ玻璃管，因爲他很像西字字母中的一個Ｕ字·我們買一根直玻璃管，可以拿他放火酒燈火上燒軟，輕輕地小心的自己彎成牠。藥品祗要濃硫酸（ＣｏｎｃｅｎｔｒａｔｅｄＳｕｌｐｇｕｒｉｃＡｃｉｄ）與氯化鈉（ＳｏｄｉｕｍＣｂｌｏｒｉｄｅ）各少許。以上的器具與藥品各儀器店都有的，但是氯化鈉就是平常我們吃的食鹽，價錢很便宜，也不必去買。</p>
<p>我們預備好了這些東西，就可以製造了。先拿長頸漏斗穿進橡皮塞的一個洞中，彎玻璃管穿進另一個洞中；乃暫且放在桌子上。再取氯化鈉（食鹽）放在燒瓶內，而後取瓶塞來緊緊的塞好·現在我們可拿濃硫酸從漏斗內灌進去，把瓶內的氯化鈉侵没。我們同時要留心，就是長頸漏斗在瓶內的一管口，必須浸在硫酸中·但是彎玻璃的口，不可浸着硫酸，他的管口須在燒瓶內的空處；其他的一口，則通入一只小口瓶內，這瓶即儲氯化氫用的。現在我們再拿二只瓶放提妥當些，就可以把火酒燈點起火來，放在燒瓶的底下加熱了。没有多少時間，瓶內就會發出無色的氣體，漸漸的通到小口瓶去了。氯化氫較空氣重約四分之一：所以儲氣瓶的口向上着，在起初是不會騰出來的，但到空氣驅空後，牠就不客氣了，一定要騰到外面來玩玩。所以我們可以拿一個塞子塞住瓶口，關牠在裏面。倘若不關住，牠出來遇着空氣就會生白烟的，此白烟是凝結於空氣中的水蒸氣所生的霧·並且溶有百分之二十的氯化氫。此製法是實騐室內的法子：牠的方程式如下：</p>
<p>ＮａＣＩＦＨ２ＳＯ４Ｎａ十ＨＳＯ４十ＨＣＩ</p>
<p>氯化鈉硫酸硫酸氫鈉氯化氫</p>
<p>向上的記號，是表明所成的物質是氣體。硫酸氫鈉就是餘留在燒瓶內的白色固體。英文名呌ＳｏｄｉｕｍＨｙｄｒｇｅｎＳｕｌｐｈａｔｅ或名ＳｏｄｉｕｍＢｉｓｕｌＰｈａｔｅ　　工業上的製造法是直接使絲氣與輕氣化合成的。我們取自己製出來的一瓶氯化氫，把牠調換一個有孔的塞子，插·一根玻璃管，拿些紙頭塞好，放牠在桌子上·那只燒瓶內的白色固體把牠倒出來；再拿淸水洗洗乾淨，洗好後放半瓶淸水，最好蒸溜水·仍舊拿雙洞塞子塞好；漏斗與曲玻璃管都可以拔去。於是拿儲氯化氫的瓶來，先把塞在管口上的一些紙頭拿脱，就插在燒瓶內，管口必須放在水底·橡皮塞子的另外一個洞，不可以塞没。此時儲氣瓶倒置於燒瓶上，但是好像變戲法，下面的水會從玻璃管內突然的向上噴到儲氣瓶內，他的力量很利害，眞好看！像一座小的噴水池·其實，一無希奇，因爲氯化氫極易溶解於水中·這水中有氯化的就是鹽酸（ＨｙｄｒｏＡｃｉｄ）；上次製綠氣是用牠的，符號是ＨＣＩ同氯化氫的一様·牠能使靑石蕋紙（ＢｉｕｅＬｉｔｕｍｓＰａｐｅｒ）變紅。氯化氫的溶液就是鹽酸。可以製氯化錏與造染料Ｄｙｅ用的。製王水ＡｑｕａＲｅｇｉａ也要用牠·醫學上用以收縮身體的組織；制止發酷；促進消化機能。説也奇怪，所以我們普通人胃液中，大約含　有0·3%的氯化氫。</p>

<p>— 建昌</p>
<p>近代的戰爭，是科學的戰</p>
<p>爭，所以我們想起來，覺得像犬一類的動物，對於戰爭上，毫無可用處了，然而實際上不然，在作戰時，精巧的機械和兵器，常常有不能奏效的時候，那就非靠狗來帮助不可了，這是從歐州大戰得到的經騐，譬如，在戰事極劇烈的時候，</p>
<p>無線電話，廻光機等通訊機關，失效的時候，就祗有靠狗傳訊的一法爲最妥當，因爲狗，雖在亂山中，也能疾走，遇河沼能跳過或游過，雖在夜間，或在濃霧中，也不致弄錯方向而迷路的，這都是人所辦不到的事，狗的速度，普通一啓羅米突，祗須三五分鐘，最適當的通信距離是二啓羅米突，較好的狗，能在四到八啓羅米突內來去·</p>
<p>『傅令』是狗最重要的任務，其他還可以任步哨，偵探，或是守衛等職，當步哨兵前進的時候，在距離敵人祗二十米突的地方，尙不易發覺，而狗能遠在一百五十米突的前方，用他靈敏的嗅覺，發覺敵人的所在，</p>
<p>當狗發覺敵人的時候，切不可使他呌，應當使他做種種暗號，如把頭向上抬，揮耳朶，或把毛豎直來，這都全靠平時嚴密的訓練，</p>
<p>在終年積雪的國家，不是常常用狗拖着雪橇，以代步運輸物品的嗎，所以，　狗在軍隊中，還可以担任運輸的工作，馬果然也好，然而高大的身子，容易被敵人瞧見，並且在土地不平的地方，不容易行走，所以不及犬之便利，重機關槍，普通二隻狗就能拖曳，</p>
<p>此外，狗還能搜尋傷兵，傷兵被發見時，便把他身上某種物件用口咬着，回去報告，軍用犬的訓練，自生後六月至一年間開始，爲最適當，</p>

<h3 id="e1">We Demand Democratic Politics <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>I remember Mr. Wang Jingwei's speech to university representatives in Shanghai on November 7th of last year. He said with firm determination, "We must use blood to seek the realization of democratic politics. We must use blood to bring forth a democratic government." However, since Mr. Wang accepted the position of President of the Executive Yuan, it has been a long time since we have heard the call for "democratic politics."</p>
<p>Yet, "using blood to seek the realization of democratic politics" is precisely the unanimous demand of the people now. We believe that to remove the shackles from ourselves, to overcome the current national crisis, and to secure a bright future for our nation, there is no other way but to immediately realize democratic politics.</p>
<p>However, the democratic politics we demand is not "equal power." It is not "party" democracy, nor is it the "false" democracy of various Western European countries. Because those are fundamentally hypocritical and are a more skillful way of lying to deceive the majority of the people. What we seek is "true" democratic politics, a democratic politics based on the vast majority of the people.</p>
<p>We believe that politics is a common matter for the people, and should therefore be in line with the demands of the people. If politics is run by a minority, it will be enough to harm the people and increasingly deviate from the interests of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Ceasefire Conference to Resume Today <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Focus is Entirely on Japan's Troop Withdrawal Deadline</p>
<p>It is Highly Uncertain Whether the Impasse Can Be Broken</p>
<p>The Prospects for Today's Meeting are Very Bleak</p>
<p>The ceasefire conference has been underway for ten days since its commencement. Although four out of the five articles of the draft agreement have been passed, the fundamental issue, the time and location of troop withdrawal, based on the previous discussions and the content of the instructions from the Japanese military to Shirakawa, make the prospects for the conference very bleak. The news obtained is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e3">British Minister Resumes Mediation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, during the meeting the previous day, the opinions of both sides on stipulating the date of Japan's complete troop withdrawal were far apart. At the suggestion of the British Minister, the meeting was adjourned for a day to allow for room for maneuver. Yesterday at 3 PM, the British Minister invited representatives from both China and Japan, as well as the ministers from various countries in Shanghai, to a tea party to mediate between the two sides again. Vice Minister Guo and others expressed that, based on government instructions and national public opinion, the final withdrawal date of the Japanese troops should be clearly stipulated in the next meeting, and no further concessions can be made. The Japanese side still claimed that it should be determined based on the situation at that time. The focus of the dispute ultimately had no possibility of convergence, and the meeting adjourned around 5 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Guo Taiqi's Remarks <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>According to the China Eastern News Agency,</p>
<p>Guo Taiqi, the chief representative of our side at the ceasefire conference, received reporters from the China Eastern News Agency at his residence yesterday. Mr. Guo still expressed great pessimism about the future of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire conference. According to Mr. Guo, the major focus of the ceasefire conference is the issue of Japanese troop withdrawal. Although there have been many discussions on this point in recent days, there has been no progress. During the meeting the previous day, he had inquired of the Japanese representative under what circumstances they believed they could completely withdraw their troops and restore the original defense as it was before January 28th. At that time, the Japanese representative said that it would be necessary after order was completely restored. At that time, he immediately used the lifting of martial law in the Public Concession and the French Concession as clear evidence that order in Shanghai had been restored, urging the Japanese side to withdraw as soon as possible. However, the Japanese representative still considered it unsatisfactory. He had firmly stated that, under the current circumstances, the areas of Zhabei urgently needed to be restored, and if the Japanese troops were still stationed there, it would cause the people to relive their past pain and experiences. Therefore, he firmly stated that the Japanese troops must have a definite time to restore the original defense as it was before January 28th, and expressed that if the Japanese troops did not have a definite date for restoring the original defense before January 28th, then all other negotiations would be equal to zero, because if the troop withdrawal issue could not be resolved, other negotiations, even if they were completed, would be useless. When the reporter asked Mr. Guo about the attitude of our government regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops, whether a date had been stipulated, and whether the instructions issued by the Japanese Staff Headquarters to Shirakawa yesterday, stating that troop withdrawal would begin within one week of the agreement's establishment and complete withdrawal to the designated area within six weeks, was stipulated in the meeting, Mr. Guo said that the meeting stipulated that the Japanese troops would withdraw to the designated area within four weeks of starting the withdrawal and completely withdraw to the original defense before January 28th within one month.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Yan Huiqing's Report <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>According to a National News Agency dispatch from Geneva on the 31st, Yan Huiqing, the chief representative of China, forwarded to the League of Nations today the telegrams he received from Vice Minister Guo in Shanghai regarding the lack of success in the Sino-Japanese ceasefire negotiations. It stated that the lack of success in negotiations thus far was entirely due to the terms of troop withdrawal proposed by Japan, which China could not possibly accept. If Japan continues to disregard the principles listed in the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly and the original draft agreement initially negotiated by both sides, and insists on its terms of troop withdrawal, then the negotiations seem unlikely to continue. It also stated that Japan should bear full responsibility for the continued instability of the situation in Shanghai. Furthermore, British Minister Lampson also telegraphed the League of Nations stating that the military attachés of France, the United States, Italy, and the United Kingdom all agreed that the Japanese aircraft's aerial reconnaissance was more frequent than before, but the Japanese military headquarters personnel had ordered the Japanese sentries not to attack Chinese troops guarding neutral inspectors. The occasional small-scale contacts between the two armies mostly occurred in a corner of Taicang.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Observations of Friendly Foreigners <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, based on the observations of friendly foreigners participating in the meeting, although the situation at the meeting has become more tense due to the instructions from the Japanese government to Shirakawa, it is not entirely so. Their view is that the instructions to Shirakawa transmitted by the news are merely a "demonstration" strategy in the diplomacy of a strong country towards a weak country. Furthermore, Japan's willingness to break off the conference is also likely to consider its domestic political situation and the international situation. Although they are unwilling to criticize the instructions to Shirakawa, the general public has already recognized that if the instructions are true, the third point clearly indicates future military preparations (statements such as Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong line being important points for military operations). It is predicted that the League of Nations may, at the necessary time, make some statement based on the aforementioned remarks and the fact that the negotiations have not yet entered the second principle.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Japanese Representative's Request for Instructions <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>According to a Japanese United News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 1st, Chief of Staff Tashiro telegraphed the Ministry of War from Shanghai, reporting on the progress of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire negotiations and requesting instructions regarding the issue of the Japanese troop withdrawal area. It was said that the Japanese side initially demanded the line of Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei, but later no longer insisted. Regarding the Zhabei area, the request was for the area east of the Six-Three Garden Japanese Cemetery to be used as a temporary troop garrison location. Jiangwan Town and the Wusong Fort were to be abandoned, and a triangular area between Jiangwan Town and a point two kilometers centered on the Wusong River dock was to be retained as a temporary garrison location. The Central Department of the Army received this request for instructions and held an important meeting this morning to discuss it.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Order from the Japanese Staff Headquarters <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 1st, the Army Staff Headquarters has ordered the Japanese representative at the Shanghai ceasefire conference to make slight concessions regarding the location of Japanese troop withdrawal, allowing for a shortening of the originally requested line and abandoning the claim to remain stationed at the Wusong Fort and Jiangwan. However, the Japanese representative was ordered to state that the date of complete withdrawal could not be stipulated, as this move would depend entirely on the local situation.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Japanese Troops Challenge on the Front Line <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>According to a special dispatch from Kunshan on the 1st, yesterday at the southeast gate of Taicang, enemy sentries attacked, but were quickly repelled by our forces. On the evening of the 31st, a small enemy detachment bombarded our Huangdu line, and we returned fire. The enemy retreated to the station.</p>
<p>According to a special dispatch from Suzhou on the 1st, east of the Sisha Creek, three or four li outside the southeast gate of Taicang, enemy sentries came into contact with our troops, and the fighting was still fierce as of Shen (3-5 PM). To the east of Baihe Furong Town, one Japanese aircraft arrived and strafed with machine guns, injuring pregnant woman Fei Zhu. She was subsequently repelled by our forces. To the east of Luduqiao, more than a hundred enemy soldiers opened fire with machine guns, and they were repelled by our forces.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Northeast Customs and Salt Taxes <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Already Seized by the Puppet Government</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, a representative of the Continental News inquired about the situation of the Northeast customs from customs officials in this port yesterday. They were all silent and unwilling to comment, but according to reliable sources, Finance Minister Song Ziwen has not yet replied to the telegrams sent to the Shanghai Customs Authority by the tax authorities of the three northeastern provinces and Dalian, reporting that the customs offices under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Customs Authority have been forcibly occupied. It is also confirmed that the customs and tax revenues of the three northeastern provinces have been taken over by the puppet government. Furthermore, the General Inspectorate of Salt Affairs in this port has also received a telegram stating that the Liaoning branch of the audit office, located in Niuzhuang, was occupied by the puppet government with the armed force of the Japanese army on March 28th. General Tax Commissioner Mellon did not say a word about this matter yesterday, as this matter has now become a major political dispute and must be handled entirely by the National Government. It is verified that the total customs revenue of Dalian last year was 12 million taels of silver, and the total customs revenue of other ports in the three northeastern provinces reached 14 million taels of silver. Therefore, this move by the puppet government will cause the central government to lose 26 million taels of revenue annually. Furthermore, the tax commissioners of Dalian are Japanese, Andong is American, and Aihun, Harbin, Niuzhuang, and Longjingcun are all British. Their positions are still unknown. According to reports, since the Japanese army invaded Liaoning last year, they forcibly entered the Liaoning Salt Affairs Audit Office on September 19th. Due to various interferences, the office had great difficulty in conducting its business. It is heard that from that date until March 28th, 4 million yuan in cash had been forcibly taken away. However, at that time, the office was still allowed to collect taxes and remit the portion that was supposed to repay foreign debts to the Shanghai headquarters. It is verified that the foreign debts secured by salt tax include the Post-Reorganization Loan, the Crisp Loan, the Hubei-Guangdong Loan, and various British and French loans. Now, they have gone a step further and forcibly occupied the Liaoning audit office. This move will destroy the salt administration of the three northeastern provinces and affect the above loans. Therefore, the foreign audit officials have lodged a serious protest with the local authorities in Niuzhuang and have been ordered to warn merchants and banks in Niuzhuang that they must not pay taxes to other parties without the permission of the audit office.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Various Businesses Opened Painfully Yesterday <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>It will be Difficult to Restore the Prosperity of Shanghai for a While; The Citizens' Federation and Other Groups Announced That All Businesses Would Painfully Open Yesterday. After the Announcement, Various Sectors Discussed Commercial Issues After Maintaining Business Resumption. The Details of Yesterday are Recorded Below:</p>
<h3 id="e12">Discussions in Various Sectors <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>After business resumption, the issue of regulating the finances of various industries was discussed. The silver and money industries decided to do their best to find ways to maintain it. However, how to maintain commerce was quite important. At 12 PM yesterday, leaders from various groups such as the Local Maintenance Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Money Industry Association, the Banking Association, the Lawyers' Association, and the Accountants' Association held an informal discussion during lunch at the Banking Association at No. 4 Hong Kong Road. Regarding the method of maintaining commerce, it would be best if stores that could not be maintained did not resolve it through legal means and should be resolved by other methods. However, no satisfactory results were obtained and will be discussed again.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Public Concession <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Xinxin, Wing On, Sincere, Da Zhonghua, Guanshengyuan, Qingtianbao, Qingyun Silver Shop, etc., on Nanjing Road officially opened for business yesterday. At the same time, Sincere Amusement Park, Tianyunlou, Xinxin Rooftop Garden, etc., also resumed business. Chinese and Western restaurants such as the Atlantic and Quanjiafu, as well as clothing stores, silk shops, and watch stores on Shilu Road, all opened for business. Slogans of "Long-Term Resistance" and "Painfully Open for Business" were posted at the entrances. The National Goods Mart on North Henan Road also resumed business yesterday. The number of pedestrians on each road suddenly increased. In the evening, each store was brightly lit, as if it had returned to the state before January 28th. However, Qi Hua Company, etc., declared liquidation due to the impact of the war.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Hongkou Area <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The North Henan Road east of the Suzhou Creek, the area north of Hongkou North Sichuan Road, Broadway Road, East and West Huade Roads, etc., were the most severely affected by the direct war. There were very few who painfully opened for business yesterday. Each store and company</p>
<p>Yesterday jointly sent a letter to the 7th District Branch of the Citizens' Federation, requesting it to be forwarded to the General Association to request the protection of the Municipal Council, stating that they would not dare to open for business until the Municipal Council had adequate protection, as there were frequent occurrences of Japanese soldiers beating store employees and forcibly taking goods. All stores were wary.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Nanshi and Pudong <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The various stores and companies in Nanshi</p>
<p>Were indirectly affected by the war quite a bit. Although the curfew period of the Public Security Bureau was shortened to 9 PM to 4 AM the next morning, due to the emergency of the war rumors, most of the goods in each store had been moved to the concessions, and the staff had scattered. Residents evacuated, so most of the stores on Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, Zhaojiabang Road, etc., were unable to resume business. Only Guanshengyuan, Dachang, Dazhanghong, etc., silk shops in Xiaodongmen and Dongmen Road, and Wuzhou Pharmacy, etc., had opened for business. The Fu'an Company was thoroughly cleaned yesterday in preparation for resuming business. Shanghai Bank and Shiye Bank have not yet resumed business. Stores in Pudong, such as Zhangtianyi, Tongfeng, Yufengxiang, Datong, and Heqiandefeng, etc., had all resumed business long ago, and there was no one who had not opened.</p>
<h3 id="e16">French Concession <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession's stores and companies were the least affected by the war. Stores in areas such as French Avenue had mostly resumed business long ago. Since obtaining the notice to painfully open for business, they fully resumed business starting yesterday. Movie theaters and amusement parks also resumed business and extended their hours.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Silver and Money Industry <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The area around Houma Road has always been the concentration of the silver and money industry. Because it had already opened, there were no special scenes yesterday. However, the procedures for collecting and paying, and the exchanges between depositors, have increased relatively. The number of clerks holding ticket bags and sacks going back and forth on the road was slightly more than in the past few days. Although various wholesale merchants had resumed business, due to the fact that the silver and money industry was still unable to fully accommodate, they could only slightly embellish the small number or important ones. They could not propose the huge amount as usual. Even bank escorts who went to pick up goods had many obstacles.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Various Factories <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>On the one hand, although a</p>
<p>Small number had resumed work last month, they could not catch up as much as possible due to stagnant sales. Even sales in this and other ports have dropped sharply recently. Large stocks of goods are still difficult to clear on schedule, so new goods dare not be stored too much. As a result, after starting work, they still used reducing workers and making fewer goods as the only way to maintain their appearance. Only the various tobacco companies, due to social needs, have not reduced their former grandeur.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Today is the One-Month Anniversary of the Fall of Songhu <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Sichuan Fellow Association Holds Memorial Service</p>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Association sent a telegram to various groups in Shanghai yesterday, saying that Songhu has fallen into the hands of the enemy and tomorrow will be the one-month anniversary. During this month, our people in Songhu have suffered greatly from the enemy's invasion, and in the ceasefire conference in recent days, the Japanese soldiers have even demanded to stay in Songhu for a long time. The great difficulties of the coming days have not yet ended. The members of this association, in grief and pain, have decided to hold a memorial service for the one-month anniversary of the fall of Songhu tomorrow, and to discuss ways to restore Songhu. We hope that all our compatriots in Shanghai will rise up together, not forget the humiliation of "March 2nd," and strive to find a way to redress it. As for how to unite the masses, how to spur the government, and not allow a few people to succumb to power, resulting in the loss of rights and the humiliation of the country, we especially hope that our compatriots will rise up to plan it. The Sichuan Association of Compatriots in Shanghai bows in Dongyin.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Inspection Report on Baihe River Area <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>A certain gentleman invited several comrades to start on foot from Qingpu on March 20th and go home for inspection. He passed through Baihe River, Huangdu, Nanxiang, Jiading, and other places, and traveled back and forth for five days and nights. On the way, he was repeatedly checked by the Japanese army and was very tired. He was sometimes walking and sometimes lying down. He traveled hard, but he was still able to get out of danger safely. It can be said that he was very tired. Therefore, he compiled what he saw and heard and recorded it below for the public to read.</p>
<h3 id="e21">No Enemy Traces in Baihe River <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Baihe River is located west of Huangdu and south of Anting, sandwiched between the Wusong River and the Daying River. Its terrain is natural. When the Songhu defense forces withdrew this time, the residents of the town were greatly frightened and fled one after another. Even the Eighth District Office and the Public Security Branch Bureau, the defense team, and other institutions had once moved to other places. After our army held Qingyang Port, there was no need for fighting there. There was no defense or defensive works nearby, so they dared to return to the town to work. However, there was a rumor in Shanghai that "a large detachment of Japanese infantry and cavalry came to Baihe River for reconnaissance." When asked to the local people who did not leave, they all said that they have not seen any traces of the enemy so far.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Xiangshi Luggage Room Burned <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Xiangcun Normal School at Huangdu Town East City End has not opened school since the winter vacation last year. There are six or seven hundred pieces of luggage for all teachers and students stored in the school, all sealed in one room. When our army retreated this time, the Japanese army followed closely and did not have time to move out. At about 9 AM on March 12th, fifty or sixty Japanese soldiers arrived in the town and forcibly pulled people to accompany them to tour the streets. Whenever they passed through party headquarters, schools, and other institutions, they would enter to rummage through boxes and cabinets, searching almost everywhere. If they saw usable sundries, they would take them away regardless of size or quality. Then they went to the school and saw the luggage piled up like mountains in the room, and the door was tightly locked, making it difficult to enter. Then a person who looked like a military officer, along with more than ten people, went to the street to take eight or nine boxes of kerosene, sprinkled them around and on the roof, and then set them on fire. In an instant, the house turned to ashes. The reporter personally went to the school at noon on the 26th to observe and saw that the newly built auditorium, general office, classroom, dormitory, etc., were still standing on the horizon. It is not true that the entire school was burned down.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Demolish Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Huangdu Town was converted from the original Jiayi Chenghuang Temple Hall. Everything inside and outside the hall has a rough model. This time, when the Japanese army arrived, first only seven or eight people, and the second time fifty or sixty people, except for burning a Xiangshi Luggage Room, there was no other action. Sixteen days later, they came and went suddenly, very busy, and they came to damage public and private buildings. Then they returned to the station. On the evening of the 17th, twenty or thirty Japanese soldiers and more than ten White Russians came again. After arriving in the town, they went to the hall and destroyed all the equipment, sundries, and documents of the Defense Team Headquarters, the Public Security Branch Office, the District Party Headquarters, the District Office, and the Jiahuang Primary School behind the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. They also moved them to the big square in front of the hall and burned them on a pyre.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Japanese Soldiers and Traitors Rob Rice Boats <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of March 23rd, four or five rice boats came from Chonggu Baihe River in the west. When passing near the Qianqiu Bridge in Huangdu, a group of Japanese soldiers and traitors suddenly came and fired a row of shots into the sky to demonstrate, forcing them to dock at the China Merchants Wheel Port in the area for inspection. The boatmen, seeing the menacing situation, did not dare to resist and listened to his command and did whatever he wanted. Before the boat docked, traitors and local ruffians in the town went down to board the boat, carrying bags of rice, scrambling and constantly. Fortunately, the boats behind, seeing the overturned cart in front, did not dare to take the risk of advancing and turned back all at once.</p>
<p>It is heard that the boat lost a total of 45 dan of white rice and 11 current oceans.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Japanese Soldiers Make Trouble for Shops <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Since Nanxiang was occupied by the Japanese army, each shop had closed its doors and moved to other places earlier because Japanese aircraft came to throw bombs from time to time. Now, the Japanese army is very inconvenient because of the need to purchase military food and all kinds of miscellaneous goods, so they separately persuaded them to go back and open the market. On the other hand, traitors from Jiangbei did a temporary master in the shop with no one consulting, opened the door to business, but the Japanese soldiers are violent in nature, do not reason at all, purchase all kinds of goods, are not cash, but with shopping certificates as proof, where the value of one yuan, at most, fill in six corners as the limit, every time the Japanese Sunday, begins to issue announcements, on Monday morning 8 AM to 10 AM, holding a shopping certificate to go to the headquarters, to receive cash, but the certificate filled in ten yuan silver, then give four yuan of national currency, four yuan of Japanese currency, such as all to be national currency, then four yuan for two yuan five corners of national currency, if there is a slight question, then fists and feet together, so a generation of merchants who have never left, and those who have been recruited back by their peers, are now fleeing one after another, and have to continue to deal with each other with a closed door.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Customs and Conditions: <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Since Sun Weiru entered Gansu, the Han and Hui ethnic groups in the Northwest have gradually integrated. Most people make a living by herding sheep and horses, and the annual output of wool and fur is very large. People's clothes are mostly made of felt. Shaanxi cotton is also very famous, but it cannot be spun and woven, so most raw cotton is sold. Northwest cloth is very precious. In the Pingliang area on the border of Shaanxi and Gansu, unmarried women do not wear pants, because cloth is scarce. Pants are made from cloth sent by the man's family only when they get married. This custom has continued to this day. If a spinning mill were established there, it would surely thrive. Mr. Zhang, who is inspecting factories, is also entrusted with the special mission of developing the Northwest's people's livelihood and reclamation. After arriving in Shanghai, he first hired Mr. Li Rongbin as the director of the Shanghai Temporary Design Office, and Mr. Cheng Peiwen as the designer of agricultural implements, railway machinery, and other drawings, Chuan Yaru as the architect of the new village factory, and Jiang Chunming as the land and mineral designer. Yesterday, Mr. Li and others accompanied Mr. Zhang to visit various factories in this port to inspect machinery and various projects, which lasted until late at night. The preparatory work for developing the Northwest was already started by Deng Baoshan in Shaanxi, and a rough framework was established, but it was unfortunately suspended due to the war. Jing Yuxiu also established a reclamation company, but it was not large in scale. Now, Yang Hucheng, Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, Deng Baoshan, and others, in their private capacities, have united with all sectors of society to organize a people's livelihood and reclamation company for the development of the Northwest, to carry out large-scale operations. As the first step, Mr. Zhang was sent south to investigate and hire specialists. According to Mr. Zhang, the first steps are: 1) Immigration, 2) Territory acquisition, 3) Purchasing machinery and agricultural implements, 4) Establishing new villages, 5) Planning mining operations, etc. He also hopes that major domestic industrialists will provide substantial assistance, and even more hopes that overseas Chinese will return to invest.</p>

<p>Taxpayers' Association and others advocate exemption of patrol fees in war zone, all industries in this city have resumed business from yesterday, bearing the pain. Regarding the issue of patrol fees in the concession, the Citizens' Federation issued an urgent notice yesterday, and the Taxpayers' Association also sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department, advocating that patrol fees in areas directly affected by the war should be exempted. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Urgent Notice from the Citizens' Federation</p>
<p>The Citizens' Federation issued an urgent notice to all district branches yesterday, stating that regarding the method of paying patrol fees in the concession, the Resumption of Business Committee has decided to discuss and decide after collecting opinions from all district branches. In addition to notifying all branches to quickly gather opinions and report them to the General Federation for submission to the Resumption of Business Committee for detailed study, it is hoped that all branches will not publicly express any opinions or methods before the Resumption of Business Committee makes a decision and has not yet negotiated with the concession authorities, so as to avoid other misunderstandings. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Letter to the Public Works Department from the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating that according to a letter from Li Yaonan and others, residents of Tongchang Lane, Hai'ning Road, No. 12, stating that the Japanese soldiers had invaded, the war zone was devastated, and the Hongkou area suffered many losses. Yaonan and others live in Tongchang Lane, Hai'ning Road, Hongkou, which is close to the war zone, and have been disturbed and suffered great losses. Now that they have recovered from their shock, they have temporarily moved back to their residences to avoid prolonged displacement. All industrial and commercial activities have been suspended, and they have no income. They are currently unable to pay all the rent and taxes due. However, recently, tax collectors from the police station have been coming to their door to demand payment of the quarterly rent and taxes, urgently and forcefully. Yaonan and others, who live there, have suffered greatly from the war and are unable to pay the rent and taxes for this quarter. Moreover, at this time of uncertainty and fear, when business has not yet returned to normal, all rent and taxes due are difficult to pay and can only be temporarily exempted. Therefore, they specially request your association to forward the situation to the Public Works Department and request that the rent and taxes for this year be exempted from collection, and that collection be resumed as usual when the city returns to normal. At the same time, Zhu Jianqing of the Huada Rubber Printing House on Shanhaiguan Road, Rui'ai Lane, and Jiang Bingwen of No. 142 Qipu Road have successively reported the violent behavior of foreign tax collectors when they went to collect taxes. Although they tried to negotiate and agree on a payment date, the foreign tax collector roared and almost used force. Upon investigation, the Japanese army's invasion destroyed the neutrality of the concession. The residents of the Hongkou area suffered unprecedented disasters, displacement, and losses due to the inability of the authorities to maintain order and protect their rights. During this period, it was impossible to reside there, let alone do business. At the same time, your bureau's patrols were also withdrawn. Therefore, the patrol fees in areas directly affected by the war during this year's January-March period, which is called the spring season, should be exempted. In addition, although the situation in other areas is relatively calm in terms of form, business is completely suspended in reality, and economic turnover is particularly difficult during this extraordinary period, which is also a matter of course. In the future, your bureau should adopt a more lenient attitude when collecting taxes and allow more time for payment. It is also advisable to employ more Chinese personnel as tax collectors, so that there will be no misunderstandings in language and no alienation in feelings. I hope you will investigate and handle this matter accordingly and reply as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Cleaning Work in Zhabei</p>
<p>According to the report of Mr. Zhou Deng, Director of the Sanitation Department of the Public Works Department, the cleaning work undertaken by the Public Works Department in Zhabei near the concession and in the [unclear] mountain area has been very effective. As a result of the efforts of a large number of workers, the area has been completely transformed. According to the report, the lack of drains and the obstruction of some rivers prevent a fundamental solution, but the current work is of an urgent nature and cannot be taken into account. Some people have questioned whether this work is really necessary, so the urgent situation is briefly explained. The first district referred to in the previous report, namely the area north of Gongping Road and Zhaofeng Road and east of Diswe Road, has removed 757 corpses since work began on March 14, some with coffins and some without. The coffins were all very brittle or only covered with [unclear]. Some of the deceased had been infected with contagious diseases. Three corpses were also found in the Shajing Port, and the water in the port was greatly corrupted. It is estimated that between 1,700 and 3,800 tons of garbage have been continuously transported from the area, which has been used to fill low-lying areas in order to achieve two goals at once. 895 people requested planting and have been planted. There is also a grove in the area, which is quite worrying, but fortunately it is far from residential areas. As for the second district, namely the area east of the railway, southwest of Diswe Road, and north of Baizi Road, the problem is smaller because many people fled during the war. Work in this area began on March 19 and has been very effective, but it is also difficult to achieve a permanent solution. It is estimated that 37 corpses have been transported from here, and another part has been transported by the Japanese authorities. There are very ferocious stray dogs in this area, all without owners. After consultation with the Japanese authorities, a total of 69 dogs were shot. The area is now quite clean. As for the Zhabei headquarters, the problem is greater because the area is under strict military control, and dangerous objects must be removed first. Therefore, work only began on March 25 after detailed consultations with the Japanese commanders. It is estimated that about 100 corpses and some coffins have been transported, as well as 200 tons of garbage. This area is south of Xinmin Road, north of Kulun Road, east of Guoqing Road, and west of the concession. The garbage transported is also prepared for filling low-lying areas. Several obstructed small rivers in the area have also been cleared. In addition, the area within the concession boundary and outside the defense line, such as the alleyways in Hai [unclear], Rehe, and Fusheng Roads, also require urgent attention. Coordination has been made with the Police Department to find ways to move the barbed wire in order to remove them. As for the Zhabei area south of the railway, it will probably take another month of work, but this is really necessary. The Japanese commander in the area has already [unclear] some unemployed Chinese to clean the major roads, but trucks are still needed for large-scale cleaning in order to avoid it becoming a source of disease [unclear]. After this, the responsibility of the Public Works Department can be relieved. As for the roads outside the boundary in the western district, Liao [unclear] is not within the scope of this report. However, some garbage has been removed in the [unclear] Du area, more than 9,000 people have been vaccinated, and 18 [unclear] houses have been disinfected, providing assistance to the reception of 10,000 refugees. This can also be noted. In general, if the above-mentioned cleaning work had not been started, the weather would have warmed up and flies would have taken the opportunity to multiply. If that were the case, [unclear] would not lead to a major epidemic, and the sharp increase in [unclear] disorders, typhoid, and [unclear] would be unavoidable. The sympathy of all parties in this campaign has enabled this office to carry out this work, which is also a matter of duty.</p>

You are hereby notified of this order. 2) In this case, this [unclear] office had previously presented a report stating that the offices in Hangzhou [unclear] and other places were charging exorbitant fees and handling matters [unclear], inciting shipowners to compensate publicly and causing trouble repeatedly, affecting the security of the province. Therefore, it requested instructions from the Provincial Government for approval. 3) [Unclear] case.

<p>The Commercial Press Maintains Textbook Supply for Autumn Schools, Pinggang Branch is Ready to Proceed. The Commercial Press is a giant in China's publishing industry. Every year, large, medium, and small schools across the country rely on textbooks published by the press for 70% of their needs. After the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, the press's factory site in Zhabei was bombed by Japanese aircraft and artillery. Fortunately, a large number of textbooks for the spring semester required by schools of all levels in various provinces had been shipped out before the war, so schools in various places were still able to cope. However, since the Shanghai factory of the press has ceased operations, the lack of teaching materials for the autumn semester in schools across the country has become a serious problem for the education sector. The press needs to supply 10 million copies of each type of textbook for secondary schools each year, and more than 500 million copies of each type of book for primary schools. The press is now concerned about the panic over teaching materials for the autumn semester in schools across the country and has telegraphed the Beijing branch and the Hong Kong branch to prepare to start printing textbooks for the autumn semester next month. Other previously stable printing businesses have been temporarily suspended in order to focus on printing textbooks for the autumn semester. It is estimated that the printing machines in the Pinggang factories are limited and not as fast as the main factory, so they can only maintain about three-quarters of the national school needs.</p>

The representatives from Tianjin and Beijing, Li Huang and Gu Zhongxiu, reported on the situation of members in Tianjin and Beijing. The Guangdong member, Zhang Zizhu, reported on the opinions of the majority of members in the South. According to the reports by Chu and Wang, they jointly proposed the following points with the representatives from Tianjin and Beijing during their discussions in Beijing, and in addition to oral presentations, they also requested Wang's written response: 1. To carry out legitimate defense against Japan and resist to the end in order to recover the lost territories in the Northeast and eliminate the enemy traces in Shanghai. 2. In order to achieve national unity against foreign aggression, to promptly end the party rule and implement democracy within six months, to formulate a constitution based on democratic principles and implement constitutional government. 3. In order to cope with the current national crisis and strengthen the government's power, before the establishment of a constitutional government, to immediately gather talents, regardless of party affiliation, and organize a national crisis government. 4. The National Crisis Conference should still be held in Nanjing. 5. Before the National Crisis Conference is convened, announce the co-existence and free activities of all parties. 6. Starting from May 1st, stop the allocation of party expenses from the national treasury and public funds. Wang did not express any concrete opinions during the face-to-face meeting. The next day, he replied in writing as follows: "Respectfully replying, I have received your letter and understand everything. I hereby list my reply as follows: 1. The National Government convened this National Crisis Conference based on the resolution of the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, with the scope of discussing resistance to aggression, disaster relief, and pacification. The Executive Yuan has collected facts regarding the above three matters and compiled reports for the reference and discussion of the members. Other issues are beyond the authority of the Executive Yuan. 2. The National Crisis Conference should be held at the seat of the government. Now that the government has moved to Luoyang to work, the Second Plenary Session of the Chinese Kuomintang decided that the National Crisis Conference will be held in Luoyang. Respectfully replying to the members, Wang Zhaoming, March 27th." After the reports from all parties were completed, the question of whether to attend the conference was immediately discussed. It was unanimously believed that the government had no sincerity towards the National Crisis Conference. Whether to attend the conference or not could be decided freely by each individual. Therefore, those who would attend and those who would not attend formed separate groups for consultation.

<h3 id="e29">Special Commissioner Zhang Lianquan for the Development of the Northwest Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Representing Shaanxi and Gansu to Console the Troops</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai to Hire Professionals</p>
<p>The Northeast and Northwest are the two major resources of our country, with fertile fields and rich treasures. In previous years, tens of thousands of farmers from Zhili, Shandong, and Henan went through the customs to reclaim wasteland. Since the September 18th Incident, the resources of the Northeast have been occupied by the violent Japanese, which has had a huge impact on people's livelihoods. The development of the Northwest is even more urgent. Last year, Yan Xishan, Feng Huanzhang, Deng Baoshan, and others proposed this matter. They all believed that the geology of the Northwest was excellent and the mineral resources were abundant. Allowing it to be abandoned would make foreigners covet it. It was decided to carry out reclamation. A large amount of funds was discussed with Yang Hucheng and others in Shaanxi and Gansu. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Incident occurred and the government moved to Luoyang. The military authorities in the Northwest had the same hatred for the foreign invaders. The 17th Route Army was also on standby. Yang Hucheng specially sent Military Counselor Zhang Lianquan to the South to represent all sectors of the Northwest to console the 19th Route Army and the various armies on the front line. He was given the title and mission of Special Commissioner for the Development of the Northwest to come to Shanghai, visit factories, and recruit various professionals. The reporter personally went to Mr. Zhang's residence to inquire about the current situation of the Northwest and the progress of development. Mr. Zhang explained everything in detail, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e30">Main Purpose of Coming South <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Lianquan is a military expert with rich knowledge. Last year, he followed Sun Weiruyin, the commander of the 17th Division, to Gansu to quell the rebellion. He has participated in the revolution for more than ten years and has lived in the Northwest for a long time. When the January 28th Shanghai War broke out, the troops of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces were ordered to prepare to go to the national crisis together. The government moved to Luoyang, and the central government prepared for a long-term resistance. Yang Hucheng went to Luoyang to discuss everything with Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, and after returning to Xi'an, he sent me to the South to represent all sectors of the Northwest to console the anti-Japanese armies on the front line, and to take on the task of special commissioner for the development of the Northwest people's livelihood and reclamation. I came to Shanghai to visit various factories and recruit various professionals. When I set off, the war was in full swing. When I arrived in Shanghai, I learned that our army had retreated to the second line of defense.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Frontline Inspection <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Zhang went to pay a visit to Dai Ji, the Commander of the Songhu Garrison, to explain the purpose of his visit. With the introduction of Commander Dai, he went to Suzhou and was accompanied by officials sent by Military Commander Cai to the forward positions such as Kunshan and Taicang. Representing all sectors of the Northwest, he expressed his condolences to the officers and soldiers on the front line. He then went to the front line to observe and only returned to Shanghai from Suzhou yesterday. Mr. Zhang said that the morale of the frontline soldiers was very high, and the rear communication lines were more responsive. The enemy army will definitely not be able to advance. He plans to go to Beijing tomorrow to visit Chairman Chiang.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Developing the Northwest <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang said that the Northwest has a very large area, dense forests, and various minerals. The population is sparse. If it can be developed, any raw materials will not need to be sought from abroad. If the surplus population of the Northeast can be moved to reclaim the Northwest, the wasteland will become beautiful products, and the people's livelihood and national economy will be solved. Mr. Zhang also gave an example. For example, Liuba County in Shaanxi Province, with a length and width of 300 miles, is full of forests and minerals, but the population is less than 5,000 households, with an average of less than five people per household. There is also a county with a population of only seven or eight thousand people, which can be said to be sparsely populated. As for the wastelands such as Guanzhong Road, Hanzhong Road, and Ziwu Road, there are even more. Moreover, the soil is fertile and most suitable for planting cotton and wheat. At present, the highest land price is only two yuan per mu.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, many domestic enterprises have been suspended, especially the film production industry has been most affected. The production agencies have been located in the Hongkou area for many years, and the photography fields have been reduced to ashes, and the negatives are also incomplete. From now on, it will be more difficult to compete with imported films. Mr. Mou, a Hong Kong merchant famous as the "Movie King", has taken note of this and spent more than 400,000 gold to purchase the Ming Garden in Hong Kong, which has always been famous. In addition to using it as a new sound film photography field for the Great Wall Film Company, the remaining houses will be allocated for the Great Wall Film Drama School and residences for actors and staff. Yesterday, it was heard that Mr. Chen Dubei, the editorial director of the company, said that this matter is still being brewed, and requests from male and female stars to join have been continuous. Mr. Chen is also in a state of being overwhelmed.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Lawyer Wang Jishi Appeals for the People of Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Wang Jishi witnessed the tragic situation of the refugees in Northern Jiangsu and was deeply worried about it. Recently, he published an article in simple words, appealing for the tens of thousands of displaced refugees in Northern Jiangsu who have traveled to Shanghai, as follows: Since the start of the war in Shanghai, a new term has suddenly emerged in society: "Northern Jiangsu Traitor". The origin of this term is that during the fierce fighting, a small number of refugees from Northern Jiangsu were in the Japanese military zone and were unable to escape. They were forced by violence to engage in transporting trenches and other things. After the retreat of our 19th Route Army, a small number of vagrants from Northern Jiangsu took advantage of the unrestored order in Zhabei to rob and steal property. As a result, society called them "Northern Jiangsu Traitors." Recently, whenever Northern Jiangsu is mentioned, the word "traitor" must be attached to it. Whenever traitors are mentioned, the word "Northern Jiangsu" must be prefixed to it, as if Northern Jiangsu and traitors are inextricably linked. The impact of this has created a result in the Southern Jiangsu area that excludes all people from Northern Jiangsu. For example, it is heard that factories and businesses refuse to hire workers from Northern Jiangsu, construction businesses do not use people from Northern Jiangsu as laborers, public residences advertise for wet nurses, stating that people from Northern Jiangsu should not try, and even shelters are rumored to refuse to accept refugees from Northern Jiangsu. All of these names of Northern Jiangsu are very vague and not based on origin, and they directly affect the lives of people in various counties north of the Yangtze River. It is found that there are no less than hundreds of thousands of people from Northern Jiangsu in Shanghai. Those who take the opportunity to rob and steal property are indeed numerous, but there is no way to prove that they are completely people from Northern Jiangsu. Even if there are a small number, most of them reside in Zhabei. Those who escape to the concession or go elsewhere to make a living are not necessarily all bad people. Why can they be excluded? These people are in Northern Jiangsu and have no way to make a living. They bring their wives and children to this place to make a living by working hard. If they continue to be excluded in the future, and their livelihoods are completely cut off, then not only will they be in danger of starving to death in ditches, but they may also be forced to take risks and endanger the security of society. I respectfully ask compatriots from all walks of life to continue to treat everyone equally, not to have the boundary between Northern Jiangsu and Southern Jiangsu, and to do their best to provide assistance, or to provide shelter, or to provide funds for relief, or to hire them as spare workers, so that everyone can get what they need. In this way, not only will the suffering people be grateful for the great virtue, but also the security of society will benefit greatly.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Lytton's Expression to the Press <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The capital press visited Lytton, chairman of the League of Nations Investigation Team, at Lixingshe at 10:30 AM on the 1st. Zhang Xianglin, director of the Propaganda Group of the Chinese delegation, introduced them. Lytton shook hands with the reporters from various newspapers one by one and talked for about 45 minutes. First, the reporter representative presented an article "Salute to the Peace Envoy League of Nations Investigation Team" and a thick album "Real Photos of Japanese Military Atrocities in the Northeast and Shanghai", which he accepted. Then Lai Lian, on behalf of the press, expressed a welcome and raised nine questions, asking Lytton to answer them one by one. According to Lytton, "I have heard the questions raised by you, and now I would like to talk to you about my general views. Among the questions you raised, the most important is the League of Nations' ability to arbitrate national disputes. You gentlemen firmly believe that the right and wrong of the Sino-Japanese dispute are very clear, but the League of Nations should handle it properly in accordance with legal procedures. For example, when two people fight, even if the bystander can confirm who is right and who is wrong, the court must go through the legal investigation procedure before making a judgment. The League of Nations sent an investigation team to the Northeast for this purpose. The sanctions of world opinion on the Sino-Japanese dispute have been fully expressed. This sanction is not based on force, but when public opinion sanctions are exhausted, the League of Nations will have a real performance. Its strength can only be expressed when the members of each country deem it necessary after the investigation report. I firmly believe that the faithful report of this team after the investigation will be appealed to the world's public opinion, or Article 16 of the Covenant can be invoked to make it effective. As for the questions you raised, I will choose those that can be answered immediately and tell you. 1. Since the third resolution of the League of Nations Council on December 10 last year, the Sino-Japanese situation has deteriorated, which is no longer a question, because the Northeast problem has not been resolved, and the Shanghai incident has unfortunately occurred. 2. The Shanghai incident is a part of the entire Sino-Japanese dispute. I believe that the League of Nations should, in accordance with China's proposal, invoke Article 11 and Article 15 of the Covenant to discuss it together. 3. Whether this team will contact the so-called Manchurian government after arriving in the East Province cannot be predetermined at this time. It will be determined after considering the situation at that time. 4. Whether the boycott of Japanese goods is the cause of the Sino-Japanese dispute or its result is a historical question. It must be fully collected and carefully studied before a conclusion can be reached. 5. There is a lot of misunderstanding about this team's trip to Wuhan. In fact, the team's authority is to investigate the Northeast incident and report it faithfully to the League of Nations. How to deal with it in the end is still up to the League of Nations. Therefore, the team's actions must be conducive to the investigation work. Any place where there is a need must be visited. Finally, Lytton made the following expression on the impression of this visit to the capital, saying that Nanjing has a vast area, beautiful scenery, and new construction plans that will be easily realized. European countries are now committed to garden cities in order to beautify them. Nanjing has all the conditions for beautifying the southern city. The future is unlimited. The questions raised by the reporters are attached as follows: 1. Since the third resolution passed by the League of Nations Council on December 10 last year, has the Sino-Japanese situation improved or deteriorated? 2. In your team's observation, is the Shanghai incident a whole problem with the Northeast incident? 3. What is your team's opinion on the so-called Manchuria state manufactured by the Japanese? 4. After your team arrives in the East Province, will it contact the puppet government? 5. The League of Nations Council has a total of three resolutions on the Sino-Japanese dispute. After each resolution, has the dispute continued to expand? What kind of sanctions does the League of Nations have against those who violate the resolution? 6. The Northeast puppet government and the people have no freedom under the violent oppression of Japan. How will your team conduct its investigation after arriving? 7. Can the Manchurian puppet state established in the Northeast under Japanese military occupation be regarded as self-determination by the people? The Manchus in the Northeast account for less than one-tenth of the total population. Even if, as the Japanese propaganda says, they demand self-determination, how can they completely ignore the opinions of more than nine-tenths of the Han people? 8. Does your team also recognize the Northeast Volunteer Army as a patriotic people's self-organized anti-Japanese army? Does your team also recognize the boycott of Japanese goods as a result rather than a cause of Japanese aggression against China? 9. When the people of the Northeast are eager for your team to go north, your team suddenly has a trip to Hankou. I would like to hear the reason. (Special Telegram on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When the League of Nations Investigation Team met with representatives of the press this morning, there were many interesting questions and answers. The representatives of the press asked whether the situation in the three northeastern provinces had become worse or better since September 18 last year. Lord Lytton replied that in some respects, the problem in the three northeastern provinces has worsened, especially with the Shanghai problem now following. Then they talked about the boycott problem. The representatives all believed that the boycott of Japanese goods was the result of Japanese aggression. Lytton said that the members were carefully investigating and studying the history of the boycott movement. A reporter asked whether the investigation team intended to visit the staff of the puppet state after arriving in the East Province. Lytton replied that they would first start the investigation and then act according to the results of the investigation. (Reuters Telegram on the 1st)</p>

<p>What the League of Nations can do in this situation. Gentlemen, I firmly believe that the right and wrong of the Sino-Japanese dispute are very clear, but the League of Nations should handle it properly in accordance with legal procedures. For example, when two people fight, even if the bystander can confirm who is right and who is wrong, the court must go through the legal investigation procedure before making a judgment. The League of Nations sent an investigation team to the Northeast for this purpose. The sanctions of world opinion on the Sino-Japanese dispute have been fully expressed. This sanction is not based on force, but when public opinion sanctions are exhausted, the League of Nations can show its true strength. Its strength can only be expressed when all member states agree that it is necessary after reading the investigation report. I firmly believe that the faithful report of this team after the investigation will be appealed to the world's public opinion, or Article 16 of the Covenant can be invoked to make it effective. As for the questions you raised, I will choose those that can be answered immediately and tell you. 1. Since the third resolution of the League of Nations Council on December 10 last year, the Sino-Japanese situation has deteriorated, which is no longer a question, because the Northeast problem has not been resolved, and the Shanghai incident has unfortunately occurred. 2. The Shanghai incident is a part of the entire Sino-Japanese dispute.

<p>Ding, Li, and Others Vow Not to Surrender to the Japanese</p>
<p>The Self-Defense Army's Momentum is Enormous</p>
<p>(Harbin) The railway tracks of the South Manchuria Railway's Dashiqiao-Ganwangzhai section were destroyed by the Volunteer Army and are currently in fierce battle with the Japanese army. Li Guilin went to persuade the Self-Defense Army with no results. Xing Zhanqing and Chen Decai led a portion of their troops to surrender and are awaiting reorganization in Yimianpo. On the 30th, Xi Qia had already sent personnel to distribute pay. Ding Chao, Li Du, Zhao Yi, Feng Zhanhai, and Gong Changhai vowed not to surrender, leading the majority to retreat to the area along the river. Several thousand Volunteer Army troops who previously belonged to Ma Zhanshan have now transferred to Yilan and joined Ding and Li. Li Du and Ding Chao are actively preparing military supplies, and a large amount has been transported from a certain direction to Yilan. The fighting in Nong'an is very intense. The Japanese side has dispatched the brigade returning to Korea to turn back and attack. According to official reports, the Volunteer Army totals 7,000 men, with many participating from the local militias. On the evening of the 30th, they attacked Xinglongshan on the Jilin-Changchun Railway. The situation there is also tense. Japanese consular staff and Japanese residents in Nong'an have all fled their homes to seek refuge. The Japanese side has decided to use three brigades of troops to attack the Nong'an Volunteer Army. 200,000 rifles and 50,000 mortar shells transported from Jilin to Nong'an to supply Xi Qia's forces were intercepted by the Volunteer Army en route, hence the Volunteer Army's momentum is even stronger.

At the same time, the Self-Defense Army between Hailin and Ning'an is also very active. The communication lines in the area have been completely destroyed, cutting off communication between the Japanese and Xi's forces. The Japanese side has again dispatched a large number of garrison troops, which were dispatched to the area yesterday morning for reinforcement. (1st dispatch)</p>

<p>To Discuss the Danube River Economic Issue</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 1st states that, according to official news today, the four major powers of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany will hold a meeting in London next week to consider the Danube River economic proposal. Many Europeans regard this conference as the starting point for European economic and political recovery. French Prime Minister Tardieu will arrive here from Paris on Sunday with French Finance Minister Flandin. That evening, British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon will dine at the French Embassy to discuss the Danube River economic plan. Poland has also recently requested to be involved in the economic alliance of the Danube River countries. Today's Warsaw Daily published an article stating that Poland's exports to the Danube River countries account for 25% of Poland's total export trade, while Germany and Italy's exports to these countries account for only 11% and 7.5%, respectively. Without an agreement with Germany, Italy, and Poland to ensure that these three countries have unfettered freedom of trade with the Danube River countries, the economic situation of the Danube River countries cannot be resolved satisfactorily.</p>

<h3 id="e91">U.S. State Department Does Not Recognize the Manchu Puppet State <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Because it Violates the Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<p>Intending to Further Sanction Japan</p>
<p>Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, New York Correspondent, Ohara telegraphs: The U.S. State Department has decided to ignore Manchuguo's request for recognition. On the 16th night, it suddenly issued anti-Japanese remarks, stating that if the U.S. recognizes Manchuria, it would be tantamount to ignoring the clear violation of Article 2 of the Nine-Power Treaty and allowing Japan to freely divide China. By not recognizing it now, the U.S. can further compel Japan. This view is fully consistent with the attitude of the U.S. State Department. It also intends to persuade other countries to take the same stance regarding diplomatic severance, and believes it can gain the consent of various nations. Except for Russia, Japan's relations with other countries are not close. Therefore, the U.S. can prevent other countries from recognizing Manchuria. However, Russia has no reason to recognize Japan either. Currently, Washington's view is that the emergence of Manchuguo is not based on national self-determination but is entirely the result of direct oppression by Japanese military force. Secretary of State Stimson's views are increasingly at the forefront of public opinion. However, Stimson consistently opposes Japan's actions solely on legal grounds. As for the practical issues (i.e., the Han Chinese traitors occupying a corner of Manchuria and proclaiming it as a nation), the State Department authorities remain silent and have not made any expressions. (Note: Article 1 of the so-called Nine-Power Treaty states that all contracting parties should respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity of China. Article 2 states that the contracting parties shall not, in violation of the principles of Article 1, conclude with China treaties, agreements, rules, or understandings that are harmful, either individually or jointly with other countries.)</p>

(3) Those whose service is extended under the provisions of the preceding two items may have their extension terminated according to the following provisions: (1) The day active duty officers and equivalent officials, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers are ordered to transfer.

<p>Bringing Silver Dollars, Flour, Military Uniforms, etc.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu, upon learning that Feng Yuxiang was recuperating on Mount Tai, visited Feng on the 26th along with Shi Yousan, Cheng Xixian, Wen Chenglie, and others, bringing a large quantity of tea, snacks, fruits, and other food items for Feng's use. Feng and Han, Shi, and others had a pleasant conversation. Han had planned to stay on Mount Tai for two or three days, but due to the numerous important military and political affairs in the province, he returned to Jinan with Shi Yousan that afternoon. Wen Chenglie and Liu Xizhong remained at Puzhao Temple to take care of Feng. Furthermore, because Feng had many attendants and daily expenses were high, and because the military uniforms of Feng's two-company pistol team needed to be replaced for the spring season, Han, upon returning to Jinan, ordered the General Headquarters Military Supply Department to prepare 10,000 silver dollars, 150 bags of flour, 200 sets of spring military uniforms, and other supplies. He then appointed Provincial Government Committee member Zhang Yue as his representative to take the Tai Shan steel armored vehicle to Mount Tai at 9:00 AM today (the 28th), both to inquire about Feng's health and to deliver the supplies. Zhang arrived in Tai'an at 12:00 PM, transported the cash, military uniforms, flour, and other items to the temporary office of Feng's attendants at the Tai'an Guest House, and then traveled by mountain sedan to Puzhao Temple to meet Feng. He then, along with Sha Mingyuan, Wen Chenglie, and Liu Xizhong, took leave of Feng and descended the mountain, returning to Jinan by the same vehicle at 3:30 PM, arriving at 6:30 PM. According to Zhang's conversation at the station, Feng's condition today seemed to be worse than the previous day or two. He was breathing heavily during the conversation, and his sputum contained large amounts of fresh blood. Wen Chenglie also said that the reason for the worsening of Feng's condition was probably due to talking too much and being overworked in recent days. If he could truly rest for a few days, the condition should ease up. (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Guangdong Army Recovers Xinfeng <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yu Hanmou Orders Troops to Reach Ganzhou by Deadline</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Yu Hanmou, the commander of the Guangdong Army's First Army and concurrently the Commander-in-Chief for Bandit Suppression in Jiangxi, determined that Xinfeng County in Jiangxi Province had been occupied by bandits for too long. Without first recovering Xinfeng, it would be impossible to open up traffic between Dayu and Ganzhou. Therefore, he dispatched the Second Division of Ye Zhao's troops and Fan Dexing's independent brigade to attack Xinfeng from the front via Dayu. He also arranged for Zhang Meixin's Fourth Division of the Second Army from Longnan to dispatch a team to flank the right side of the bandit area. First, the air force bombed the bandit army's defensive works between Nankang and Xinfeng. Separately, the First Division of Li Zhenqiu's troops was dispatched from Dayu to take the road via Xincheng, flanking the bandits' left wing. All units completed their deployments on the evening of the 20th and issued a general attack order on the morning of the 21st. Although the Xinfeng bandit army, the so-called First Group's Twenty-fourth Division under Zhang, stubbornly resisted, their defenses had been destroyed by the Guangdong Army's air force. They only held out for a few hours before abandoning the city and fleeing in disarray. Fan's brigade and a portion of Zhang's division on the right flank entered Xinfeng City at noon on the 21st. In this battle, hundreds of bandits were killed, and over a hundred guns were captured. The remaining bandits retreated to Longhukou, about eight li from Xinfeng, while others retreated to places like Maling and Gupo. Currently, Zhang's division on the Guangdong Army's right flank is preparing to dispatch a team to pursue and suppress them towards Yudu. Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Army, has already reported the recovery of Xinfeng to the authorities. The headquarters, seeing the army's continuous advances, ordered the military supply department to allocate 250,000 silver dollars to be transferred to the Jiangxi border by the army's rear office as military expenses. It is reported that Yu Hanmou, now that Xinfeng has been recovered, has ordered the vanguard troops, Ye Zhao's division and Fan Dexing's brigade, to reach Ganzhou City by the 25th. The defense of the Xinfeng-Nankang area will be taken over by Zhang's Fourth Division of the Third Army. Once they arrive in Ganzhou, they will divide into two routes to attack Yudu and Xingguo.

<h3 id="e95">He Chengjun Urges Xia Douyin to Return to Hubei to Govern <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>And Telegraphs the Ministry of Finance to Quickly Allocate Outstanding Subsidies</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the Executive Yuan resolved to reorganize the Hubei Provincial Government, the new provincial government members, except for Zhu Huaibing, Huang Jianzhong, and Cheng Ruhai, who are in Hankou, remain in Beijing. Moreover, Shen Zhaonian, the concurrent Finance Director, and Huang Jianzhong have strongly requested to resign. He Chengjun, the former Provincial Chairman, returned to Hankou to preside over pacification efforts after resigning from his post in Beijing, as provincial administration could not be interrupted. It is reported that he has telegraphed the new Chairman, Xia Douyin, urging him to return to Hubei to govern and inviting the committee members in Beijing, Kong Geng, Sun Sheng, Li Shucheng, Shen Zhaonian, and Yan Xunfu, to come to Hankou as soon as possible to take over their respective duties. Furthermore, given the heavy responsibility of the Finance Department, he has repeatedly urged Shen Zhaonian to return to Hankou first to take charge. However, it is reported that Shen's intention to resign is firm. Song Ziwen from Finance greatly favors Wu Guozhen, the former director, as his successor. He telegraphed Wu to go to Beijing on the 30th for discussions. As for the position of Education Director, it was originally intended for Wang Shijie to hold concurrently. Wang, the president of Wuhan University, did not want to exchange his current position for that one, and after strongly declining, Huang Jianzhong was appointed as his successor. However, Huang is also firmly refusing to accept the position. In addition to repeatedly telegraphing his resignation, he went to Beijing on the 30th to resign in person. As for the other committee members, there has been no negative expression. It is also reported that Xia, Kong, Sun, Li, Yan, and others plan to come to Hankou within days. If the heads of the Finance and Education Departments can be quickly resolved, the new provincial government should be able to be established before April 10th.</p>
<p>He Chengjun, the former Provincial Chairman and concurrent Finance Director, believes that the central government owes a substantial amount in subsidies, and that the financial situation is particularly difficult at this time of transition between the old and new administrations. Therefore, on the 30th, he telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to quickly find a way to allocate and remit the funds to cope with the situation. The telegram reads: "To Minister Song Ziwen, Finance Department: The Hubei provincial treasury is empty and unable to maintain operations. The new officials are about to arrive in Hubei, and the settlement of the various military, police, political, and educational expenses owed, as well as the private advances, is extremely difficult. According to investigations, the subsidy fees owed to Hubei Province by your ministry amount to 450,000 yuan for November of last year, and 500,000 yuan each for December through March of this year, totaling 2.45 million yuan. Please find a way to raise these funds and promptly remit them to Hubei to cope with the situation. I also hope for a telegram in response. Your brother, He Chengjun, bowing, 30th (March 30th)."</p>

<p>Escorted from Beiping to Jinan for Execution by Firing Squad</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Xue Chuanfeng, the notorious leader of the "Big Spear Society" in western Shandong, has been a scourge to the area for many years. Xue has successively served as the division commander, brigade commander, and commander of various irregular armies, and has also served as the commander of Kou Yingjie's Tenth Army. He was brave and skilled in battle, once capturing a county seat with only seven men. Therefore, almost everyone in Shandong Province knows of Xue Chuanfeng. Xue was a native of Yanggu County. In recent years, he had amassed considerable wealth and lived in Tianjin as a resident landlord. Recently, the Tianjin authorities discovered this, arrested Xue, and sent him to Ping for interrogation. Han Fuqu, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, received a telegram from Zhang Xueliang notifying him of this and, after agreeing with Zhang, decided to escort Xue to Jinan for trial. On the day before yesterday (the 25th), he dispatched Dong Xiangbo, a military judge from the Military Law Office of the Third Route Headquarters, with a team of over 40 law enforcement officers, to go to Ping by train. Today (the 27th) at noon, they escorted Xue to Jinan. After disembarking, they sent him to the provincial government. At 4:00 PM, Han Fuqu personally interrogated him once. Xue confessed to his years of banditry and harming the local area. Han immediately ordered the Military Law Office to bind Xue and take him to the execution ground on Weiba Road in the commercial port for execution by firing squad. He also dispatched a large number of military police, traveling in three cars, to escort and guard the area. By 4:30 PM, Xue had been executed. The people were greatly relieved. (27th)</p>

<h3 id="e97">Gold Market Slightly Higher <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Full-Day Operations Resume Yesterday, April 1st, the Gold Exchange resumed its original full-day operating hours. The trend of gold prices rose slightly, but people's hearts were hesitant and unpredictable. The initial outlook was high, due to the continued decline of large silver bars. Unexpectedly, the exchange rates of British and American currencies rose, and the U.S. dollar seemed to loosen, with both forward and spot sterling tightening. Various firms were enthusiastic in selling, once breaking through 680 taels. The market turned slightly calmer at noon due to a certain bank purchasing spot goods. Trading in the later market was sluggish, and the situation was also calm, standing at 81.2 taels, eventually edging up by about two taels. According to the exchange's records, there were approximately 11,000 to 12,000 silver bars. Yesterday, various firms slightly settled public orders, i.e., spot goods for April, estimated to be about 800 bars or so. The full-day situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The market opened high in the morning The May futures opened at 682.5 taels, up 2.5 taels. Large silver bars fell by a quarter, and silver prices remained the same. However, private telegrams were down by 3/16. Subsequently, they continued to increase by 1.5 taels, to 84 taels. Dalian firms sold slightly, and prices fell back to 1.5 taels. Then, Yuhuo, Hengyu, Qian Changxiang, Richang, and others bought in, and the market rose sharply, rising by 5 taels, to 86.5 taels at 9:30 AM. As for the opening of the sterling exchange rate, it was adjusted to a decrease of 125, and the U.S. dollar did not change, which was why the exchange rate rose. However, gold prices were stable. Then, HSBC offered May U.S. dollars at 32.625 yuan, and various banks mutually transacted June dollars at 8125, and Yuanheng sold on the market, falling by more than 4 taels, to 82.2 taels at nearly 10:00 AM. Before long, small investors added up to 3.5 taels. Afterwards, the exchange market weakened, and forward U.S. dollars at 33.125 yuan were not easy to sell. However, British gold was stable. Especially Yuanheng continued to sell, and Hong Kangyong, Dadecheng, Cheng Dayong, Richang, and others sold one after another, so the price could not be supported and fell again by more than 5 taels. There was a slight fluctuation of more than one tael, and then it broke through 80 taels, reaching 78 taels at 10:40 AM. Afterwards, Hengxing, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Hong Kangyong, and others came to buy in, and a certain bank took in 210 bars of cash, which was sold by Hengxing and others, so the price rose again. Also, Shanghai Maihang and others absorbed forward U.S. dollars from 33.125 yuan to 33.0625 yuan. By 11:30 AM, it was 81.4 taels, with a fluctuation of only one tael or so. After entering, Yuanheng and Hengyu sold again, cutting down another 3 taels, to 78.3 taels. By noon, it recovered more than one tael, totaling 79.8 taels.

At 2:30 PM, it was 82 taels. Then, it was slightly less than seven or eight cents. At 2:45, it rose again. Hong Kangyong and others came in, and HSBC even ate in U.S. dollars at 625 this month. At 3:40 PM, it was 83.3 taels, but the various firms did not trade much, and it was just a false show of strength. Moreover, Yuhuo and others sold, causing the price to fall back. U.S. dollars for this month can be settled at 6875. After 4:00 PM, it was 81.3 taels, rising again to 2.2 taels.

<p>Silver Dollar Market After Resumption of Business</p>
<h3 id="e100">Interest Rates Weak...Copper Coins Lengthen Even More <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview Yesterday, all stores in Shanghai began to resume business, and the atmosphere was refreshed. According to the past situation, there should be a good scene to record. However, the national crisis has not yet ended, and merchants and civilians painfully opened the market. This kind of forced smile through tears has no possibility of development. Finance is the engine of all industries, and of course, it will rise and fall with the prosperity and decline of various industries. There is no important matter to record for this bleak market situation. Therefore, the recent market price decline is well-founded.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices Due to the lack of demand and the crowding of sources, the "yangli" price fell. Yesterday, the early market was 7 qian 1 fen 07 hao half, and the afternoon market was 7 qian 1 fen 02 hao half. As a result, it was less than half a li, and the situation was still difficult to stabilize. There is a fear of continuing to decline. The "yin chai" early and afternoon markets were still 1 qian 5 fen. The bank listed the price at 6 fen, and the discount plus water was half of the previous day, totaling 6 qian. The silver lending situation was slightly lively.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Transactions The early market for "yangkuan" remittances was 330,000, and the afternoon market was 480,000. The banknote early market was 45,000, and the afternoon market was 25,000. Check transactions were 70,000 to 80,000. Bank transactions The morning market mutual market was 300,000, and the afternoon market mutual market was 400,000. The bank yang households traded more than 700,000. The Qianzhuang Yang public orders collected and settled more than 4.2 million. The small Qianzhuang traded more than 300,000. The "yinkuan" interbank lending transactions were more than 1.7 million. The silver public orders collected and settled more than 34 million. Bank collections and settlements were slightly better than the previous few days. Foreign banks collected and settled various items totaling more than 4.3 million. Chinese banks collected and settled various items totaling more than 2.8 million. Remittance collections and settlements were more than 400,000. Mortgage remittances were more than 600,000. Customs revenue was 400,000 to 500,000. There were no reports of entry and exit from warehouses.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market The early and afternoon markets for Jiangnan small silver dollars were both 6 qian 2 fen 1 li, slightly better than the previous noon by 1 li. Transactions The early market was 4,000 jiao, and the afternoon market was 1,500 jiao. Guangdong small silver dollars continued to decline. The early market was 6 qian 1 tuo 9 li, and the afternoon market was 6 qian 1 fen 9 li 2 hao half. As a result, it fell by about 2 li compared to the early market of the previous day. Due to the fact that small deposits in the Zhabei area have been gathered in one place, copper coins are suffering from oversupply and cannot flow smoothly. As a result, market prices are lengthening every day. Yesterday, it was extended by another 2,500 wen, to 415,500 wen. More than 38,000 strings of wen were traded.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Yarn and Flower Spot Yarn Customers' Sales Are Still Active <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>More Than 1,100 Bales Opened for Trading</p>
<p>Cloth Market Did Not Open for Auction Yesterday</p>
<p>The spot cotton yarn market showed a slight vitality. Sichuan buyers were more active, but other buyers were less active. Because the Sino-Japanese peace has not yet been compromised, the flow of finance is blocked, and commerce is difficult to develop. Therefore, there is little hope for large-scale business. According to Cantonese Zhuang customers, there is a large inventory in Guangdong. Recently, market prices have suddenly fallen by 20 yuan. Inland buyers have been affected by the war. Yarn prices in Wuxi and Changzhou are about 10 yuan lower than in Shanghai. Japanese warships are densely packed along the Yangtze River, and people are afraid. Sales of Japanese goods in the north are still strong. Therefore, judging from the overall situation, there is no prospect of smooth sales of yarn. Fortunately, the cloth market is active. Although all factories are fully operational on the surface, many workers have not returned to the factory due to fleeing Shanghai for safety. The work has not been fully started. Therefore, the output of each factory is not strong, and there is still little bottom inventory in the market. If we wait for the restoration of transportation, then yarn sales can improve, and market prices can be prosperous. There are still dissatisfied people with the issue of the total price settlement of the standard flower yarn market of the exchange. It has now been dredged by the authorities, and there are already some clues. Therefore, according to the news of the brokers, the opening date of the auction business should not be far away. Spot yarn Check the statistics of all the purchases made by each gang on the whole day, more than 1,100 bales, 700 bales from Sichuan, 40 bales from Yunnan, 110 bales from Guangdong, 115 bales from the inland, 25 bales from the North, 15 bales from Fujian, 60 bales from Hankou, 5 bales from Anqing, 12 bales from Jiangxi, 5 bales from Ningbo, and 30 bales from the same industry. The market is trending down.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Spot Cotton Xin's Appetite Is Particularly Healthy <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>2,600 to 2,700 Pieces Traded</p>
<p>The need for spot cotton was quite improved in the middle of last month. Due to the obstruction of various sources, the inventory in Shanghai was thin, and the external cotton market was stable. Therefore, the attitude of the holders was strong and not accommodating. As for the situation of the U.S. and Indian cotton, there was instability every day, and the decline was quite strong. The reason was that the cotton stockpiled by the Agricultural Administration Bureau was being sold in the market. European Russian cotton was very cheap, so market prices fell. Judging from the general trend, there is still instability. Check that the highest spot price for U.S. cotton was 7.2 li, and it has now fallen by 100 pounds. Therefore, various factories have seen the weak state of the world's cotton industry, and there is no active action on the raw cotton layer. However, some manufacturers are purchasing and adding to their needs. For example, yesterday Xin Xin imported as much as 2,000 pieces of U.S. cotton. The following is a list of the prices of the spot cotton sold yesterday:</p>
<p>Shaanxi Flower 34.50 Xin Xin imported 100 pieces of spot goods and sent them to the factory</p>
<p>Xia Sha Flower 34.0 Xin Xin imported 120 bales and more</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Flower 35.00 Xin Xin imported 200 pieces and more</p>
<p>U.S. Seed Flower 34.75 Xin Xin imported 100 pieces and more</p>
<p>Lingbao Flower 31.25 Xin Xin imported 100 pieces and more</p>
<p>Si Qu Lie Meter Ling 34.00 Xin Xin imported 2,000 pieces and loaded them into the factory immediately</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was soft due to a decrease in buyers, weakness on Wall Street, and poor Liverpool telegrams. Futures fell by 20 to 22 pounds, and spot goods fell by 20 pounds. British cotton futures fell by 45 points, and spot goods rose by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was closed.

<h3 id="e104">Grain – Foreign Rice Market Suddenly Booming <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Twenty Thousand Bags Sold Briskly in Ten Days</p>
<p>Yesterday, sales of foreign rice were very brisk. Our local market sold 2,000 bags, the Yangtze River traders shipped out 5,000 bags, and various inland routes took 4,000 bags. These were all small-batch spot transactions. Sales of Saigon rice were somewhat lower, with only local merchants taking some. Small-batch rice sold at 9.475 to 9.65 yuan, while Saigon No. 1 sold at 10.07 to 11 yuan, an increase of about 0.2 yuan. Compared to the lowest price at the beginning of last month, it is about 0.5 yuan higher. Recently, the main demand has been long-grain rice. Hankou traders have shipped out 100,000 bags in the past ten days. Nanjing traders have taken about 40,000 bags. Wuxi, Chongming, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and our local market have also accounted for over 50,000 bags. In total, about 200,000 bags have been sold. There are about 700,000 bags in stock. New shipments are arriving recently. Futures for April small-batch rice are selling at 4.725 to 4.73 yuan per tael, and 1,000 tons of March goods in transit are offered at 4.55 yuan per tael.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the rice market in Shanghai South remained sluggish. Sources from the west route (蘇路) and 同路 were the most numerous. Prices opened 0.1 yuan lower across the board. Foreign “Du Jian” (洋杜尖) also fell 0.05 yuan due to weak sales. There was a shortage of thin-skinned rice, and the traders slightly moved, increasing the price by more than 0.1 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice shops in Zhabei (閘北) that opened for business were Xiechangde (協昌德), Wanshengtai (萬盛太), Ruichang (瑞昌), and Tongxing (同興), among others. There were some transactions, with prices opening about 0.1 yuan higher or lower than the previous market. Inland sources included Wuxi, Jiangyin, and Qingpu No. 5.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Current Flour Sales to North are Very Brisk <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Military Vessels Open at 2.0 Taels Net - Concluded at a Premium of About 0.05 Yuan. The Flour Market’s Stagnation Has Lasted Two Months. Due to the serious situation, futures flour had to be settled in full. However, due to the demand for civilian food, current flour, despite being in settlement, still had to be bought and sold with reluctance. In early February, there was not much fluctuation. Starting in March, with the cessation of hostilities and sales to various routes, activity gradually resumed. In the first few days of the month, the price was comparable to the settlement price. By the latter half of the month, with particularly active sales to Tianjin, and the demand for current flour surging after futures settlement, asking prices improved. By the end of the month, the price had opened at 2.0 taels mill price. As of yesterday, with various businesses reluctantly opening, and Tianjin and Shandong traders still making purchases, military vessels opened at 2.0 taels net, Red and Blue Car (紅藍車) opened at 1.995 yuan, Green Double Horse (綠雙馬) opened at 1.99 to 1.985 yuan, and Green Wheat Root (綠麥根) opened at 1.965 yuan, all about 0.05 yuan higher than the settlement market value. However, this situation is purely driven by temporary needs. The stock levels of various mills remain plentiful, with No. 2 flour reaching 500,000 bags and No. 4 flour reaching 200,000 bags. Only No. 3 flour is in short supply, so the outlook is stable and prices are not expected to rise excessively. As for Tianjin selling prices, in December of last year, Shanghai flour bottomed at 2.85 yuan. In February of this year, it peaked at 3.15 yuan. Currently, it is selling for 3.07 yuan. The highest sales volume reached 60,000 to 70,000 bags, with normal sales at 20,000 to 30,000 bags. However, the Tianjin market value is still subject to exchange rate fluctuations, with the foreign exchange rate reaching a maximum of 0.756 yuan in February, and currently at 0.7067 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm silk market, although all American firms received telegrams from New York regarding transactions, the asking price for B-grade white filature silk, measured at 80 “Evanes” (i.e., evenness), was less than 700 taels. Due to the high cost for the factories, it was difficult to sell. Yesterday, Ewo (怡和) took 10 bales of Shanghai white filature silk spot, Jardine Matheson (筆篤) took 10 bales of yellow filature silk, and Ker Chang (克昌) took 12 bales of yellow coarse silk. Prices remained flat and weak.</p>

<p>— A Group of Gold</p>
<p>We want to see his facial expressions because words are the voice of the heart, and the heart is the commander of qi. Confucius said, "Observe his eyes, how can a man conceal himself?" Therefore, kind people naturally express kind attitudes, and vicious people naturally express vicious attitudes. No matter how much they try to disguise, under the gaze of ten eyes and the pointing of ten fingers, their heart and lungs are as visible as if seen, and cannot be disguised.</p>
<p>The League of Nations investigation team will soon go to Dong Province (Liaoning) to inspect. This village (this group) has summoned the traitors Zhao Xinbo (趙欣伯), Yu Chonghan (于冲漢), etc., to discuss how to deal with the investigation team. It has been decided that Zhao and others will welcome the team in the name of a puppet organization and propose multiple illegal conditions to petition the team. I will not ask about the content of the multiple illegal conditions that Zhao and others will petition to the investigation team. First, I want to ask what Zhao Xinbo and others' attitude will be, and what their words will be?</p>
<p>If you ask about their people, they are citizens of the Republic of China. If you ask about their official positions, they are officials of the puppet organization. If you ask about their souls, they belong to the backstage boss, Japanese imperialism. I ask you, will Zhao and others speak for the Chinese people? Or will they speak for the puppet organization government?</p>
<p>Or will they speak for Japanese imperialism?</p>
<p>All men turn blue with anger, white with fear, and red with shame. When the heart is uneasy, the face shows awkwardness, and when the heart is in pain, one does not know whether to laugh or cry. When Zhao Xinbo and others see the League of Nations investigation team, their faces will definitely show a certain expression. I wonder if they will turn red? Be awkward? Not know whether to laugh or cry? Or will they be nonchalant and talk freely?</p>
<p>The proverb says, everyone has a sense of shame and aversion, everyone has a sense of right and wrong. No man is a saint, who can be without fault? If there is an occasional mistake in words or deeds, or a slight violation of virtue, then glossing over faults is a common thing. However, for citizens of the Republic of China to organize a puppet government is treason, and for the puppet organization government to be a puppet of imperialists is shameless. Everyone knows the history of the establishment of the puppet organization government, and every country knows it, but these people still shamelessly call themselves "so-and-so of our puppet organization government." If their hearts and livers are not completely gone, they would definitely be unable to utter such words.</p>
<p>Some say that these people are out of their minds and do not know what shame or the state is, or what personality is. If these people had a human heart or a conscience, they would never do such a crazy thing. If that is the case, then I can only deeply prostrate myself before these people.</p>

<p>— Zhuzun (柱尊)</p>
<p>The whole country is talking about resisting Japan, who will continue in the southeast after the northeast? The Nineteenth Route Army are good men, their angry hair rising up like sword light. They enter enemy territory as if it were an uninhabited land, the Chinese soldiers are all like red makeup. Who knew that once they showed their skills, they would fight the enemy on the battlefield? The enemy soldiers come like wolves and tigers, alas, the thousands of families in Zhabei, are all turned into scorched earth in an instant. Sacrificing for the country, they dare not say it is bitter. Looking up and down, prosperity and decline have become ancient history, the people cry in pain, wanting the world to become dark. The battle lasts for months, flowing away like water, who knows the heart of the main general in the capital? Which is better, the acting capital or the accompanying capital? The Song family crossed south, but now they stop north. If China has no extraordinary men, it will surely see the barbarian dust rising in the northwest.</p>

<p>— Mengshaozhu (夢苕主)</p>
<p>Martyr Hu Amao (胡阿毛), a native of Shanghai, was a boatman. During the chaos, he went to Hongkou (虹口) and was captured by enemy soldiers, who forced him to drive a cart of ammunition. The martyr pretended to agree, and the enemy soldiers supervised him closely. When he reached the riverbank, he quickly drove into the water and sacrificed himself. He was forty-one years old. He still has an old mother at home.</p>
<p>The cart rumbles along, where are we going? The enemy soldiers are abducting me to dash across the battlefield. Alas, the objects piled in the cart, are filled with poison. One bullet can kill a person. Destroying them is better than killing a hundred barbarians. The time is gone and cannot be recovered, today's events are for me to govern. Let me die to save a hundred people, one death will not fail my own person. The whirlwind speeds up and the body enters the water, shouting, "Mother, I am coming home!" National affairs are important, family is trivial. People and bombs are exhausted, none remain. The waves crash against the sky, the cart's shadow disappears,</p>
<p>Ten feet in the river's heart buries white bones. Today, the river's heart adds white bones, tomorrow's battlefield will have fewer white bones. These bones enter the sea with the river's waves, and the dragons see them and flee far away. Transforming above into thunder and lightning, below into mountains and peaks, the heroic spirit is long and thin, and the stars are high.</p>

<p>— Zheng (徵)</p>
<p>Readers, I am introducing you to green gas. Because this element likes to make friends very much, it can combine with many substances. What I am talking about now is the combination of green gas with the extremely simple gas, light gas, transforming into a new substance, which is called hydrogen chloride (Hydrogen Chloride). Its symbol is HCl.</p>
<p>It is quite a coincidence that the equipment we need to use to manufacture it is exactly the same as that used to make green gas. It only requires an alcohol lamp; a wide-mouthed flask; a rubber stopper with two holes; a long-necked funnel; and a double-bent glass tube. This tube can also be called a U-glass tube because it looks a lot like the letter U in the Western alphabet. We can buy a straight glass tube and soften it over an alcohol lamp, then gently and carefully bend it ourselves. The reagents only require a small amount of concentrated sulfuric acid (Concentrated Sulfuric Acid) and sodium chloride (Sodium Chloride). All of the above equipment and reagents are available in instrument stores, but sodium chloride is just ordinary table salt, which is very cheap and does not need to be bought.</p>
<p>Once we have prepared these things, we can start manufacturing. First, we insert the long-necked funnel into one hole of the rubber stopper, and the bent glass tube into the other hole; then we temporarily place it on the table. Next, we take sodium chloride (table salt) and put it in the flask, and then take the stopper to tightly seal it. Now we can pour the concentrated sulfuric acid into the flask from the funnel, submerging the sodium chloride inside. At the same time, we must be careful that the tube of the long-necked funnel inside the flask must be immersed in the sulfuric acid. However, the mouth of the bent glass tube must not be immersed in the sulfuric acid, its tube mouth must be in the empty space inside the flask; the other mouth is then connected to a small-mouthed bottle, which is used to store hydrogen chloride. Now we place the two bottles properly, and then we can light the alcohol lamp and place it under the flask to heat it. In a short amount of time, a colorless gas will be emitted from the flask, gradually passing into the small-mouthed bottle. Hydrogen chloride is about one-quarter heavier than air: so the mouth of the gas storage bottle should face upwards, and it will not come out at first, but when the air is driven out, it will not be polite and must come out to play. Therefore, we can use a stopper to plug the bottle mouth and confine it inside. If it is not confined, it will produce white smoke when it encounters air. This white smoke is the fog produced by water vapor condensing in the air, and it contains 20% hydrogen chloride. This method is used in the laboratory: its equation is as follows:</p>
<p>NaCl + H2SO4 = NaHSO4 + HCl ↑</p>
<p>Sodium Chloride + Sulfuric Acid = Sodium Bisulfate + Hydrogen Chloride ↑</p>
<p>The upward arrow indicates that the resulting substance is a gas. Sodium bisulfate is the white solid remaining in the flask. Its English name is Sodium Hydrogen Sulphate or Sodium Bisulphate.</p>
<p>The industrial manufacturing method is to directly combine silk gas with light gas. We take a bottle of hydrogen chloride that we have made ourselves, replace it with a stopper with a hole, insert a glass tube, plug it with some paper, and place it on the table. Pour out the white solid from the flask; then wash it clean with water, preferably distilled water; and then use the double-holed stopper to seal it. The funnel and curved glass tube can be removed. Then take the bottle storing hydrogen chloride, first remove some of the paper stuck in the tube mouth, then insert it into the flask, the tube mouth must be placed at the bottom of the water. The other hole in the rubber stopper cannot be completely blocked. At this time, the gas storage bottle is inverted on the flask, but as if by magic, the water below will suddenly spray upwards from the glass tube into the gas storage bottle, its power is very powerful, really good looking! Like a small fountain. In fact, nothing is strange, because hydrogen chloride is extremely soluble in water. The chlorinated water is hydrochloric acid (Hydro Acid); we used it last time to make green gas. The symbol is the same as hydrogen chloride. It can turn blue litmus paper red. A solution of hydrogen chloride is hydrochloric acid. It can be used to make ammonium chloride and dyes. Aqua Regia is also made with it. In medicine, it is used to constrict body tissues; stop fever; and promote digestive function. Strangely enough, the gastric juice of ordinary people contains about 0.3% hydrogen chloride.</p>

<p>— Jianchang (建昌)</p>
<p>Modern warfare is scientific warfare, so we might think that animals like dogs are of no use in war. However, that is not the case in reality. In combat, sophisticated machines and weapons often fail, and then we have to rely on dogs for help. This is what we learned from the European War. For example, when the war is very intense,</p>
<p>when wireless telephones, searchlights, and other communication devices fail, the most reliable method is to rely on dogs to transmit messages, because dogs can run quickly even in chaotic mountains, and can jump over or swim across rivers and swamps. Even at night or in dense fog, they will not make mistakes in direction and get lost. These are all things that humans cannot do. The speed of a dog is usually three to five minutes per kilometer, and the most suitable communication distance is two kilometers. Better dogs can travel four to eight kilometers.</p>
<p>“Message Delivery” is the most important task for dogs. They can also be used as sentries, scouts, or guards. When sentries advance, it is not easy to be discovered within 20 meters of the enemy, but dogs can use their sensitive sense of smell to detect the enemy's location as far as 150 meters ahead.</p>
<p>When a dog discovers the enemy, it must not be allowed to bark. It should make various signals, such as raising its head, waving its ears, or raising its fur. This all depends on strict training in peacetime.</p>
<p>In countries with year-round snow cover, are dogs not often used to pull sleds to transport goods as a means of transportation? Therefore, dogs can also be used in the military for transportation. Horses are indeed good, but their tall bodies are easily spotted by the enemy, and they cannot walk easily on uneven ground, so they are not as convenient as dogs. Two dogs can usually tow a heavy machine gun.</p>
<p>In addition, dogs can also search for wounded soldiers. When a wounded soldier is found, the dog will bite a certain object on his body and return to report. The training of military dogs is most appropriate from six months to one year after birth.</p>

<p>A group of Zhabei residents became refugees on the evening of January 28th. They fled from the artillery fire of Zhabei to Dachang (大塲). There were many bombs in Dachang, so they went to Zhenru (眞如). There were also bombs in Zhenru, but it was not prosperous, so they could only go to Nanxiang (南翔). However, Nanxiang was a military rear, which was not ideal, so they changed course and did not go towards</p>
<p>the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway, but turned to Qingpu (靑浦). Unfortunately, although the location of Qingpu was good, Japanese aircraft came again, so they had to flee again, and reached Jiaxing (嘉興) after detours. Unexpectedly, before they could rest their heads on their pillows, Japanese aircraft fired machine guns, so they fled to Hangzhou (杭州). They heard that there were also bombs there. They became anxious. Although China is large, there is no place to settle down. There was no way to think of, so they returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>This time, they fled in a panic all the way, seeing bloody heads, bullets, scorched corpses, incomplete limbs, markets destroyed and leveled, and even the scene of beastly behavior, shocking to the eye. Of course, there is no need to elaborate. They could not help but cry bitterly.</p>
<p>They still arrived in prosperous Shanghai. They thought at first that at least this stimulation given by the enemy would bring about an even greater and more exciting manifestation from the general public, but when they arrived in Shanghai, they were stunned. They saw the racecourse packed with people, with no less than thousands of people gambling. In the dance halls, graceful figures danced, and the decadent music still pierced people's blood vessels. The movie theaters had "full house" signs hanging up eight or nine out of ten times, and the representatives of modern society on the streets still shrugged their hips and breasts as if nothing had happened, with their faces painted as red as blood - redder than the scars of the front line. They hooked their arms and walked in step on the main road, envied and pursued by the general public. They were really confused. They did not believe that the city of Shanghai had suffered a serious blow in words. They did not believe that Shanghai had experienced war. They did not believe that there was cruelty and pain in the world. Ah! Their whole hearts were blocked by these things, and they were completely at a loss!</p>
<p>Alas, those self-proclaimed saviors of the country who are more numb than the dead!</p>

<h3 id="e114">The World's Number One Gemstone Mine <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Yizang (一臧)</p>
<p>Most of the gemstones used around the world now are supplied by the gemstone mines near Kimberley in the South African Union. Recently, due to the global economic downturn, the mine has also been closed. It is said that the gemstones and diamonds produced by the mine now have an inventory of more than 100 million yuan, stored in the factory, and no customers have inquired about them. Therefore, the workers working in that mine have had to suspend work. It is said that when the mine company was first established, it only invested one million yuan of capital in the Cape Colony. Later, it gradually merged with other companies, and today it has monopolized the gemstone mining business. Since last year, the world's economy has been in a panic, and the business of London's largest gemstone market has plummeted. Gemstone shops are on the verge of bankruptcy and have closed one after another.</p>
