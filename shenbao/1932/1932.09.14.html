<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本承認僞國與世界和平</h3>
<p>仁</p>
<p>日本樞府之僞國承認案。已於本日上午十一時在宮中開緊急會議。全體通過。並經批准。於午後電令武籐赴長春簽訂承認條約。噩耗傳來。國人莫不悲憤交集。而其外交當局。猶復張大其詞。宣傳世界。謂日本之承認。將於世界和平及遠東和平之維持。有極大之貢獻。嗚呼。世界和平之語。日人用以欺列强而求與合作者久矣。然眞正和平之基礎。早爲日人之暴行所摧毁。世界各國。無不知之。蓋日本帝國主義恃其武力。一意孤行。割裂中國之領土。旣製造僞國於事前。復承認僞國於事後。步步進逼。使愛好和平之中國民族。墮入於忍無可忍之絶境。不幸而一旦爆發。因形勢之牽連。世界和平之不能保。恐無待於蓍蔡。而世界從此多事之新形勢之造成。將於此動其機矣。</p>
<p>今日與中國問題最有關係之列强。除美國外。厥唯日法英三國。此三國間之共通政治動向。與其在華利益之均霑互相牽制本無所謂甲干涉乙或乙干涉丙之可能。此日本所以侵略我東北而無所顧忌者一也。且最　蘇聯之勢力日甚。各國咸視其爲目前唯一之敵。而形成今日世界爲蘇聯及非蘇聯之兩大壁壘。列强爲鞏固其對外力量起見當絶力避勉其内在的傾軋。此日本侵略我東北而無所顧忌者二也。歐戰勝利之國家在歐陸方面。略露其爭霸之雄心者。即不免爲人所嫉忌。故此勝利之國家。不能不在亞洲求一與國以爲臂助。而亞洲之足爲與國者厥爲日本。旣欲引日本爲與國自不能不先與日本以便利日本得此與國之默契即可爲所欲爲。此日本侵略我東北而無所顧忌者三也。</p>
<p>大戰以還。世界之過剩生産。巳如山積。於是列强爲開拓其販路計。不能不以政治與武力爲後盾。以求世界之新分割。唯對於分割之實行。各有所顧忌。不敢逕行發作。今日本之悍然承認僞國。分割我東北土地。即無異實行分割之端。撥世界大動亂之鍵。此其一也。近數年來。世界列强之間。衝突益顯。雖軍縮之會頻開。而備戰之意日亟。於是各國爲取得其戰爭原料計。又不能不求世界殖民地之再獲得。日本旣獲取我東北。以肆其獨佔之陰謀。在列强失之於東隅者。將何所取償乎。此其二也。</p>
<p>綜此兩面觀察。日人旣發動其侵略東北之野心。自　肇世界糾紛之始。歐洲列强。雖一時未必即有表示。而利益衝突。終不能免。且日美關係之惡化。早呈相互對立以待戰機之形勢。設一旦中國門戶開放之形勢破。歐州列强。復仍就其昔日所謂勢力範圍。以求其勢力之均衡。則我東北淪亡以後。其接踵而來之亞洲問題。當必十百倍於今日。故今日之事。非我國急以武力討伐僞國。或列强予以充分合理之判斷。則世界和平前途。寗堪問耶。</p>

<p>議長不承認解散令旋即軟化</p>
<p>巴本恃總統爲後盾發揮榷威</p>
<p>路透社十二日柏林電　德國會今日發生前所罕有之怪劇、議長戈林不承認解散令爲有效、仍召集國會明日集議、其所持之理由、爲政府業已失敗、故不能解散國會、一般人以爲此種局勢之造成、將引起甚嚴重之後果、戈林議長後乃幡然變計、决定取銷其前議、苟戈林仍守續開國會之决定、則政府勢必阻止其開會、而於必要時、施用武力、亦未可知、故在戈林取銷前議以前、一般人甚以政府與國社黨將大起衝突爲慮、凡主張和平之公民、甚盼國社黨勿走極端也、戈林之所以取銷前議、因接到巴本總理來函、内稱、戈林不容總理在國會辯論之舉動、及戈林處置共産黨不信任案之方法、皆爲不合法行爲云、政府繼宣佈在國會解散後、僅外交委員會可照常辦事、政府將視明日事態之發展、然後再向興登堡總統條陳下屆選舉日期、戈林語人、渠不能承認巴本所稱國會曾採用違法手續之責言云、巴本總理晚間發出播音演詞、遍致全國、維護政府之立塲、力言國家統一之必要、並請在國際軍縮討論時期、尤不可不全國一致、若被視爲二等國而無軍備之保護則何以堪、内閣將於數日内决定如何進行此項重要問題云、</p>

<p>敎育消息特載</p>
<h3>小學訓育問題（上）吳增芥</h3>
<p>小學敎育、不但是使兒童獲得知能、並須呌他怎樣做人、小學校訓育的重要谁都不能否認、最近敎育部舉行課程招生委員會議、將小學課程加以修訂其中最值得注意的就是設置「公民訓練」以施行「直接訓育」江蘇敎育廳在數天前頒佈了中小學訓敎合一的辦法福建敎育廳在本年暑假内召集全省中小學訓育會議、並在該廳主辦的暑期學校裡設「小學訓育」一學程由作者擔任講演敎育行政機關之重視兒童訓練可見一班、</p>
<p>我們試考察現在一般小學校的訓育實施情形、不外下列幾項工作</p>
<p>（一）兒童自治组織兒童自治機關、由學生推選領袖、担負工作、</p>
<p>（二）訓練週由訓育系或訓育會議編訂實施辦法、分别進行</p>
<p>（三）奬賞與懲罰學生有良好行爲、給予奬品、不良行爲、由敎師任意處罰</p>
<p>（四）訓話校長·訓育主任級任訓導敎師在公共集會或各級期會級會夕會時對學生口頭訓誡、　　（五）貼標語用成語諺語、格言寫成標語、貼在敎室裡走廊裡、或公共地方</p>
<p>這許多辦法表面上看來覺得很妥善不加思索的人、或者以爲對於小學生的訓育不過如此、其實你如果細細想一想、這些辦法都有流弊都有問題、值得我們去研究的、現在提出幾個亟須注意的問題、和小學敎育界諸同志討論、（一）怎樣訂定訓育條文訓育條文是考查訓育成續和實施訓育的根據、不但敎師很有用處、學生有了這種條文也可以隨時反省家長要知道子女在校裡的情形、祗要看他能夠實行條文裡的那幾條、編訂條文、却不能隨便、第一、要看地方情形地方上的缺點、要特别注意、第二、要看本校的情形、本校學生的特有缺點、要多加訓練、多列幾條因之甲地小學適用的條文未必適用於乙地同一地方的小學校的條文、也未必完全可以通用而最須注意的一點、就是鄉村小學和城市小學的條文應有區别</p>

<p>林寳華邱飛海昨日與卡那凡洛江道章作草地網球會公開雙打第二週賽於中華網球場、林邱以直落三淘汰之而獲複賽權、比賽空氣、尙稱緊張、尤以末盤爲甚、成績列下、</p>
<p>林寳華邱飛海六比三六比三九比七卡那凡洛江道章</p>
<h3>卡江不能維持均勢</h3>
<p>第一第二兩盤、開場形勢、皆殊平均、首盤林開球勝一局、卡等奪回之、二二而三三平手、其後忽連失三局而負第一盤、第二盤亦如法泡製、卡江以三比二佔先、連失四局、再負一盤、直至第三盤、形勢一變、</p>
<h3>卡那凡洛刁滑可喜</h3>
<p>此曾握上海雙打錦標之老將卡那凡洛、其出球之刁滑、恐海上無出其右、惜以體方不濟不得不退居少年英俊者之後、卡於第三盤中、時時以富有柔性之高球、飛過林邱、使其不得不退居底線、然後上網撲殺之、林邱屢爲所窘、而迭成第三盤之局面、</p>
<h3>第三盤互爭之可觀</h3>
<p>第三盤爲難解難分之局互相獲一局、直至七比七之後、林邱再得二局而定勝負、該爭亦最可觀、卡江以高球退敵、施以猛烈之壓殺、而雙方在半塲之互相撲射、亦爲精彩之一、惜卡之反手、無戰鬥之力、而江之抽擊、時人網内、故雖每以三比一計居先、而卒歸失敗也、</p>
<p>觀衆紛擾影響比賽第三盤方以四比四互相力爭之際適棒球場足球完賽、於是成千之人、如　擁來、秩序大亂、將球場左右前後圍住、比賽曾爲之停止片刻、據卡那凡洛事後談、適此一局、大可反敗爲勝、不幸爲亂者之阻碍而失、懊喪萬分、甚望當局有以設法改進管理、免貽外人口實也</p>

<h3>昨日足球大賽</h3>
<p>東華林肯和局</p>
<p>丨雙方各勝三球丨</p>
<p>丨表演頗見精彩丨</p>
<p>丨明日再行交鋒一</p>
<p>東華足球隊昨與林肯隊在中華棒球塲作友誼比賽、此爲冬季足球大賽之開端、海上球迷、作壁上觀者四五千人、飽享眼福、滿意而歸、尙有可觀、林肯來勢凶凶、先獲兩球、東華急起努力、攻入一球、林肯以二比一佔優於上半時、下半時東華陣線調動、實力增强、連中兩球、反居優勢、後又被林肯射中一球、乃成三比三和局而終、</p>
<p>東華實力未見滿意　東華昨在上半時中、陣容散亂、攻守爲難、危機四伏、時有失守之虞、前鋒尤見軟弱、難得進取機會、下半時起、大調人馬、馮運佑主中堅、屠開元任右外衛、陳家球任前鋒、陳虞添由翼而改内輔、實力增强不少、故能連勝兩球、然無論如何、前鋒力量、究欠强勁、須善事爲之、陣綫列下、</p>
<p>陸鍾恩　李寗　馮運佑上關淘安下　吳幼良馮運佑下屠開元上陳家球上屠開元下錢敬鏞陳家球下萬象華上陳洪光歐陽永源上陳虞添下曹秋亭下陳虞添上</p>
<h3>林肯實力依然如故</h3>
<p>林肯隊爲去年甲組之首席、並得高級杯决賽權、（昨誤爲史高托杯舊賽權）右翼柯克罕姆KIRKHAM尤見勇猛、海上無出其右、中鋒右内鋒及中堅、亦均前年埠際賽上海代表、全隊傳遞甚佳、前後鞏固、名不虚傳</p>
<p>海斯　阿許透納　柯克巴勃利克斯　白爾特萊巴恩斯巴海琴斯利特萊柯克罕姆</p>
<h3>念分鐘内連失兩球</h3>
<p>三時啟幕、　　林肯先攻、形勢頗見緊張、與夏令足球不可同日而語、爲時無幾、林肯右内鋒用迅速之脚頭、傳球東華門前、中鋒躍起頭頂、球卽入門、極敏捷輕脫、東華猝不及防、乃負一球、入後東華數度反攻、聲勢頗盛、但射門不佳、失機再者、徒使觀衆頓足嘆惜、攻旣不利、後方又告危險、屠開元在門前救球不愼、手犯球而被罰十二碼、林肯右翼主踢、球對門之左角、着地滾去、門將陳鍾恩雖有先見之明、但阻擋稍遲、已不及救、二十分鐘内、東華連負兩球</p>
<p>東華迫進漁翁得利斯時林肯聲勢極盛、東華門前、危機四伏、時有城門失火之勢、林肯幾次迫成角球、幸陸鍾恩屢次解危、化險爲夷、前鋒乃興歸問罪、然在平淡之局勢中、林肯兩内衛内救球和讓被萬象華收漁翁之利、建立奇功、不一分鐘、上半時終了、東華以一比二負</p>
<p>陣綫調動奇兵突出　易門再戰、東華鑒於上半時之弊病、乃重整軍容、實力驟增、頓時聲勢浩大、不可一世、先則失機者再、後由錢敬鏞之傳中、右翼曹秋亭獨出冷門、攻入一球、一時觀衆掌聲雷鳴、不數分鐘、陳虞添亦中一球、東華忽以三比二反敗爲勝</p>
<p>最後一球嘆爲觀止　東華盛極而衰、自此又現不景氣狀態、而林肯再接再厲、餘勇可賈、全軍侵入、東華又告危急、李寗一再挣扎、屢救險球、卒被右翼之美妙傳中、球在門前十五碼處、尙未落地、左内鋒順勢鈎球、碰然一聲、淸脆可聽、球如離絃之矢、應聲入門、功夫之佳、堪嘆觀止、林肯復一再進迫、其勢浩蕩、東華努力周旋、得以苟安過去乃成三比三和局而終</p>
<p>明日下午再决勝負　二隊已决定明日（十五日星期四）下午、仍在棒球場作第二次友誼比賽、球迷眼福、可謂不淺、</p>

<p>林宋訪汪昨日汪氏仍未在庽、午後二時零五分、宋子文赴汪宅訪汪、由汪夫人陳璧君女士接見、宋將辭出時、而國府主席林森亦蒞止、遂相偕重入汪宅、坐談片刻即去、唐有壬於下午四時訪汪、未幾亦辭出、昨日汪氏寓處、仍守秘密、祗其家人進出甚忙、且上午陳璧君携帶花瓶雜物、用汽車往返數次、一時頗有汪氏遷居傳說、</p>

<h3>九三老人馬相伯語録</h3>
<p>— 景記</p>
<p>風雨中的問題丨農工商</p>
<p>在一个星期日的正午我正在家午餐忽然風雨聲中傳來的話「徐先生，老先生請你去丨」於是就櫛風沐雨的到樂善堂。</p>
<p>原來是勞大護校師生冒雨來乞援相老人就囑我，分函執政當局，要旨是說：丨丨</p>
<p>「國立勞働大學，年來對於農工勞働界文化之促進與提高，爲國家及社會獨一之貢獻，國家及社會所當發起與保存。責無旁貸：興復猶易……等語。」</p>
<p>過幾天，接行政院汪院長覆函；農工的大學，留一線生機，又函蔡孑民先生等，促成復興勞働大學：相老人在擬稿上親批改的警句是：「立國以文化爲先：勞働爲民生之本。」隨後派我面謁蔡先生時，蔡先生表示接收此函的。相老人如此注重農工，但並不輕商；且主張農工商合作，下所述的一事，可證。</p>
<p>又是一個星期日的下午，也有些風雨點綴炎暑的空間。我被委參加中央商學院畢業同樂會；因爲是徐院長盛意邀請的。臨行，請示如何措詞，相老人說：丨丨</p>
<p>「商要和農工密切合作丨不然，祗是所謂販夫走卒，賺點搬塲走路錢」，那裏配做商人？商學必注重國民生計的需要，如市塲布怗如何可裁衣料，不致濫費，商家要和工塲共同打算的。農産物的出售，準此。希望學商的放大眼光來研究！」</p>
<h3>伏生雜記</h3>
<p>— 濳</p>
<p>（一）官的威力</p>
<p>俗語道「窮不和富抗富不和官爭」在我國社會上有錢的人算頂得時都不敢和官爭，官的威力也可想見了。</p>
<p>記得幾年前有一個收房捐的，到我家去我說「某人家的房屋比舍下多幾倍，何以捐也差的不多似乎不大公平。」那人把簿子一收道「你說不公平麽？走我們一同到縣裏去講去」我說「好！我們就一同去」結果旁人把我拉下。</p>
<p>我我想想，幸虧那時没去倘若去的話恐話只有往鐡窗前一坐。儘管我是總理信徒，縣大老爺不見得和我談民權民生主義</p>
<p>（二）危險的回憶</p>
<p>談到收房捐，我又連想到一件危險的事。這時我不過是一個熱血無知的靑年原來我被收房捐的差人駡過一番後，心中未免有些憤恨，所以我便寫了一大張匿名的宣言，意思是說縣長在革命政府之下居然橫征暴歛，魚肉人民，我們非得應用民權的力量把他罷免不可。宣言已寫好了，不知何故，却没有貼出去。</p>
<p>我現在回想起來又幸虧未貼丨倘若貼了的話，恐怕早上貼，晚上便脚鐐手銬，禁錮起來，第二天早上押赴北門外關帝廟一彈畢命了。罪狀是「反動分子」。</p>
<p>這些事都已過去了就是那位俞縣長現在也不知所往。不過我想，中國之大，這些兪縣長目下恐怕還不在少吧。</p>
<h3>俏皮話</h3>
<p>— 梯公</p>
<p>看弄堂的紅頭阿三，因爲偷張公館的東西，被巡捕房捉進去吃官司了。不料張姨太太忽然上公堂，請求將阿三交保。張公館的常年顧問律師，趕緊打電話問張老太爺，這是什麽意思。張才太爺支吾了半嚮道；「這大約是小妾的人道主義罷。」</p>
<p>百貨公司老闆請王先生吃飯王先生道；「貴公司這幾天大犧牲軋坍了銅欄杆，不是要明吃虧嗎。」老闆笑迷迷低低的道；「我們自己人說，不要緊，那裏肯眞虧本，少賺點罷了。」王先生回去，他夫人喜孜孜告訴他道；「我今天在Ｘ公司剪了六件旗袍，統扯不過兩塊錢一尺，眞眞便宜。「王先生摸着小鬍子道；「你也便宜」他也便宜，看來吃虧的是我。」</p>
<h3>獅子吼了</h3>
<p>— 傅雷</p>
<p>劉獅的繪畫展覽會已經開幕而閉幕了。這是一件可喜的事。因爲，在此兵荒戰亂，國難當頭的辰光，藝術家並未放棄他文化上的戰線而格外地戰戰兢兢努力着。</p>
<p>劉獅是一個十二分聰明伶俐的靑年，我常勸他做人要聰明而不伶俐，做藝術家尤其要有三分戆氣，這當然離伶俐很遠。劉獅最易受人影響，因爲他伶俐。一個未成功的作字當然免不了受人影響，但影響與模倣有異，而伶俐的結果，往往會埋没自己的個性，而把影響與模傲相混。劉獅似乎已懂得這一點，一年來的努力都在想解脫他那徬徨歧途苦悶，深信不疑地尋覓他自己的途徑。他慢慢的去棄肖似，織巧，艶麗，那些膚淺的，眩人眼目的技巧，而作着統一，藴純，綜合，沉着的試騐。風景畫中如「雪壕」「號聲」「八字橋」「秋晨」「風景七○號」及普陀近作中之「南天門」，都有這種趨勢。輕靈活潑的小手法在這些作品中已經絶跡而另是一種雄的揮灑，他一向用的鮮艶奪目的色彩，也轉變到深沉含蓄的幽怨的旋律上去了。在此，我並非說用色不能鮮艶，但鮮艶要不俗，要有底藴。鮮艶的畫筆若能在深沉凄絶的詩意中洗鍊出來，則其鮮艶將不再是外表上的美觀而是平和幸福的内心表現了。「晚霞」一作，就是一個好例。</p>
<p>肖像畫中之梁小姐，文箴女士，朱小姐等三幅不獨已經和「友之母」「wenchen小姐」等那種扭扭揑揑，支離破碎的面目完全不同，而且在嘗試大膽的省略，心理的窺測，和裝飾風的現代趣味了。</p>
<p>「三僧石」「肖像速寫」二幅，「普陀海浴」二幅，是劉獅展覽會中最爲特出，值得一提的作品。「三僧石」純粹是西洋工具所産生的東方藝術，這是簇新的，前途無限的蹊徑。「肖像速寫」富有粉畫的韻味，而無纖巧澀滯的感覺。是一個新發見。「普陀海浴」則是最近於杜斐ＤＵＦＹ的裝飾趣味，只是不能和杜氏的天眞與超脫的情調相比罷了。「雪壕」佈局的大膽，是是劉獅技巧上顯著的成功。</p>
<p>目前這黑暗混亂的時代與國家，正是培養藝人的最好的機緣。獅子，你得記住這話，切莫辜負了它！</p>
<h3>銀絲（十三）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>（七）</p>
<p>「樓上的瘋子，是姓袁？」袁團長心中在疑惑，或者是好奇心所衝動，所以指着樓上向芬若詢問。</p>
<p>「是的，伊只是一個縫窮婆吧了；可憐伊没有一個家族：我們兩人便相依爲命了。」芬若嘆了一口氣，只自去冲茶，没有向袁團長當面講。</p>
<p>「伊旣然和我同姓，又是你的好朋友，且待我去瞧望瞧望吧。」</p>
<p>「不……不要上樓，伊不能見生人，請你原諒吧！你且飲一杯凉茶，該到會塲去了」芬若遞了一杯茶給袁團長。</p>
<p>「爲什麽不把伊送到瘋人院呢？」</p>
<p>「有錢的進瘋人院，或者還優待些；窮苦的進去，簡直是進牢獄，除了受無期徒刑般的永遠監禁，死在裏面以外，伊是早無天日的了。好得伊有時腦筋淸楚的时候，還和平常没病的人一樣；伊發病，我便任看護，大家都是苦人，互相照呼些，也是一件好事。」</p>
<p>「伊怎麽會成瘋病，也許受過什麽剌激？」</p>
<p>「詳細是我不知道，似乎是被丈夫所遺棄的一個婦人，因爲伊從來没有談過；我問伊，伊也不願說。」</p>
<p>「這人太可憐了；但是你難道也願意這麽一輩子和瘋人相處了麽？光陰是這麽快，人事也太多變遷。你應該自己保重一些！最好，你搬到城裏去住，要是不願和這瘋子離開，便一同搬去，我應該盡我的力量，帮助你們。到了城裏，也可以請一個好醫生給伊診治診治。」</p>
<p>「我們還是以自己解决自己的生活，這幾年裏，苦日子也過慣了，城裏去反不方便。但是，我狠想聽你講一些我們分别了以後的快樂史，請你簡單地說，五分鐘也夠了。」</p>
<p>「芬！我只簡單地告訴你一句話，你便可以想得到我這幾年裏的情形了。」</p>
<p>「究竟是怎樣呢？你至少添了幾個孩子，也和你一樣的英俊而使人敬愛。」</p>
<p>「咳，我的芬！我至今還是一個鰥魚，那裏來孩子？」</p>
<p>「那麽你的夫人呢？」</p>
<p>「我自從離開了丨逃出了我的家，我的故鄉，去投了軍以後，始終不曾和家鄉任何一個人通過信，我的妻子也不知去向。靑年的活寡婦，也許也另外嫁了一個狠好的丈夫，我也但願伊是這樣如我所料；否則一定是死了。」</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市站定</h3>
<p>滬南昨日米市、各帮米船共到十六七號、本街交易不旺、常錫北粳及蘇同帮零碎斛開百石左右、開盤降低角許、東新與早晚稻胃口寥寥、形勢下游之象、新洋尖蒋白尖隨到隨銷、行情定局、</p>
<p>新閘米情内地來貨不多、約抵十數號、而河存不濃、城鄉店銷乃綠秋節已屆、愈覺呆滯、厚粳蒞稻二種各低近角、新粳新杜洋尖到銷二敵、價無漲跌、新客尖胃口全無、形勢步跌、</p>
<h3>西貢米存薄轉俏</h3>
<p>北帮辦裝暹邏米</p>
<p>昨洋米市况、居堅穩之局、西貢米存底漸少而本街與鄉莊胃口甚佳、昨辦去一千五百包、行情竟帶緊二三分、暹邏米與小絞米、昨有北帮問津、市氣亦形轉機、惟小絞米存底獨裝、去化有限、市面仍居軟象、統市開出暹邏米一千包、價八元九角半、小絞米五百包、價八元六角至八元五角半、西貢一號米一千五百包、價九元二角二分至九元二角、江西機元米一百零五包、價十三元三角、其中由北洋帮辦去暹邏米一千包、小絞米二百包外、統爲本街辦去、</p>
<h3>標粉賣氣奇濃</h3>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份一致呈暴落之象以洋麥報價、驟跌五六角左右不等、以致一般人之心理、大爲惶恐、且以洋麥連日報落、現貨來華、勢又不免、故賣氣甚盛、阜豐廠之出數、亦甚暢盛、其餘各廠、尙趨觀望、惟大勢已去、遂不能復呈好勢也、迨至下午開盤、初尙見平、後傳阜豐曾有洋麥定成、合價祗三兩八錢二分、故仍陸續出檔、内地多願、因米價之鬆落、不敢買進、故後步仍看平疲也、結果本月份較前日跌一分二厘半、十月份跌二分二厘半、十一月份漲二分七厘半、十二及一月份跌三分半、二月跌三分七厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥暴落六七分</h3>
<p>昨期麥上下午開盤後、各月份一致呈暴落之態、以洋麥報價、又續跌五六角不等、洋麥之報價、已連小幾日、人心初尙硬擯、昨以跌度甚銳、致買戶多已放棄、不敢再進、空戶則又續出、所以交易步暢、市勢亦步見不振、觀最近情形、如洋麥確有現貨成交、本麥前途、擯守過甚、將來不免重受打擊也、結果九十月份較前日跌五分、十一月份跌六分、十二月份跌七分、一月份不動、二月份跌七分云、</p>

<p>昨日糖市以標金續漲、荷匯又縮、公會劉盤依然緊秀二十四號粗砂白普通貨劃十四兩四錢七分半、比前日升二分半而出戶甚少、後市仍看好勢、人氣極佳、但因秋節在卽、銷路方面未免遜色耳、節後如匯市無變動、則市價盯望續升也、本廠冰花靑三號貨市存本缺、昨大來號開出振興貨八十包價十兩零半、不　多開、勢順趨緊、</p>
<h3>南北貨木耳疲極回漲</h3>
<p>木耳前市如上莊四川貨曾降至六十兩以内惟物極必返、勢所使然、故邇來已見步緊、川耳開過六十四兩至六十三兩半、宜昌耳六十一二兩至五十八九兩、次之有二三兩上落漢訊什耳五十一兩、馬蘭坪貨五十二兩八錢、劃申難和、此間銷路、惟温台帮較多、閩帮次之、粤帮因有直接採辦、無甚交易、現行盤副耳開九十五兩什耳六十一二兩至五十六兩、趨勢平定、</p>
<h3>生哂圓肉號盤回跌</h3>
<p>生哂桂元肉、自出新以來、到貨尙屬不多、查此批太原輪到申、共計運到七十餘箱、爲數雖屬不多、然身份大都潮軟故走場較滯、市勢轉疲、昨日號方業已開出五十餘箱、價比前跌去三兩許云、</p>
<p>絲茶海外白廠經來價續跌</p>
<p>昨日美莊乾利藍樂璧等行、均接有紐約來賬九·十·十一等月份之中身白廠經、來價又續跌十兩至十五兩、各廠商鑒於秋繭售價不廉、絲本攸關、堅持不敢承抛、是以昨祇寳克進雙童牌十三至十五條份現貨白廠經五包、價扯六百五十兩、三星等進棉州黃粗絲二十五包、價扯四百零五兩</p>
<h3>乾繭價看跌</h3>
<p>秋　上市絲銷疲滯…繭本看小三四十兩邇來洋莊絲市、因受日絲廉價傾銷、海外絲價猛跌歐英絲銷步趨疲滯、是以滬埠較繭售價看跌、加以蘇浙新秋繭次第上市、繭産乾增、繭身亦優、各廠商原料進胃轉懈、繭本每絲一擔有賢小三四十兩之勢、昨日滬北恊記等絲廠談判常錫春乾繭五百餘擔、卒因論價不合致未成交云</p>
<p>針眉綠茶法銷活動</p>
<p>昨日路莊土莊爾路之針眉綠茶、英莊怡和恊和等行、因接到摩洛哥來電需求、且因匯價鬆動、進意轉　濃厚、售盤亦略堅挺、路莊珍眉綠茶抽蕊貨略形活潑、普通貨依然停滯、貢熙綠茶、昨市白頭莊裕瑞昌等行、略有進胃、但俄國恊𦔳會、依然抱定非廉不購態度、市面無從進展云、</p>
<p>五金薄白鐡紛紛下跌</p>
<p>薄白鐡近來無論英美諸貨、均見紛紛跌價、揣其原由、泰半因供廣於求况節邊伊邇、各帮均暫時停辦、是以市情異常淸淡、惟邇來洋行現貨紛紛抛出所以人心恐怖、標凖因此益有江河日下之槪、刻市三七尺紅鳥牌英白鐡每張祗售九錢四分紅洋字九錢二分、雜牌九錢、聞洋行開出大批、祗八錢七八分、三六尺紅鳥牌英白鐡估八錢、雜次七錢六分、四十八張美白鐡每担估十五兩、比之先前英白鐡跌去三四分、美白鐡降落五錢、惟人心甚軟、市勢尙看再小云、</p>
<p>煤炭大同塊煤一疲一穩</p>
<p>大同塊煤、分有兩種、一係提揀過者、一係篩塊、日來提塊銷路不多、盤價稍軟、而篩塊煤去路較佳、每日有一二百噸交易、故價極穩定、昨市提塊煤每噸十三兩二錢五分、篩塊煤十二兩五錢云、</p>

<h3>尷𡯓文人</h3>
<p>— 滄萍</p>
<p>肩不能捐，手不能提，又不能賣買做生涯！這就是文人尷尬的總原因。</p>
<p>從古以來，威靈顯赫的固然是文人，終身潦倒的也是文：翻一翻古今小說，做文人的究竟有幾個出人頭地？而老死牖下，終身湮滅的文人，究竟有幾個？吾可以肯定的說：在一千個文人裏頭，有一個能出頭的，已經多算了。</p>
<p>唉！文人旣這樣的没有出路，而現在做學生的偏偏都羨慕文人，好容易，窗下十年，到頭來，偌大山湖，無一席噉飯之地，賦閒在家，仰屋興嗟，到那個時候，纔嘆一聲！肩不能挑，手不能提，反不如一個小販，他們有的是力，自做自吃，倒來得自由自在。</p>
<p>做有聲勢的文人，固然「筆掃千軍」「一字千金，」但在潦倒的文人，憑你有文章錦繡，但是飢不能食，寒不能衣，至多不過告告地狀，擺一個測字攤，代人寫寫書信。</p>
<p>吾也是一個文人，因爲吾已嘗着了文人的滋味，故不自形醜的寫下這篇（尷尬文人）以告未來的文人？希望他們再不要向死書裏去鑽，再不要斯斯文文的做文人，快一些還過頭來，求一些實在的技能，在這片競爭劇烈的世界上爭生存，再不要做一个死氣沉沉的文人。</p>

<p>馬跡車聲拂面塵，陌頭花是舊時春　　高樓　厦殘痕在，　有斜陽照　　　　人，</p>
<p>故國山河千劫在，烽烟兵火事成塵，繁華畢竟人爭取，此地依然百戲陳，</p>

<h3>四度空間談片</h3>
<p>— 丁成偉</p>
<p>本來這四度空間是在相對論中所討論的問題；相對性的原理是個很難得的東西，决不是初學科學的人所能了解，不過我自從看到了這個問題後，我覺得對於這個問題的興趣　非常　　　同是我感觉到在我們日常生活中有很多的例子，很可以用來解釋和說明四度空間的，現在舉幾個日常生活中所慣見的例，並以最簡單的原理來說明</p>
<p>在没有討論這問題前，我們應該先認淸空間的定義，在過去這定義是只要能　　　　　　物　　　　品　間　不過自從愛因斯坦登台後·他就把空間的定義廣大·他認爲空間非但包含着長闊高，同時時間也是空間的一個原素，</p>
<p>從前牛頓氏把空間和時間看做絶對獨立的二件東西，不過自愛因斯坦的相對論發表後，他把時間也歸併在空間和　　高連起來，命成四度空間</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>第四度空間是什麽？簡單地說，就是時間</p>
<p>在一度空間中的一切，只有位置和長，如幾何上的點和線，牠們是能在一度空間中存在，</p>
<p>二度空間中的一切，有長也有闊，但没有高，</p>
<p>三度空間中的一切，長闊高齊備，旣有位置，又有容積，</p>
<p>四度空間中的一切，除了長闊高外，還包含着時間性，</p>
<p>我們如以坐標法來表示，一度空間，僅有一條直線作軸（Ｘ軸），但牠的二端，可無限制的延長，二度空間就可以在一平面上相互埀直的二直線（就是Ｘ和Ｙ軸）來表示，三度空間就用在空間相互埀直的三條直線（Ｙ·和Ｚ·軸）來表示，那末四度空間，當然也應該用空間互埀直的四條直線（Ｘ·Ｙ·Ｚ·Ｔ軸）來表示，但在事實上空間是不能同時有四條綫，相互埀直，所以這裏我們就只好這樣的假定說四度空間除了三條相互埀直的直綫外，尙有一條虚綫是能和這三條綫相互埀直的，</p>
<p>同時愛因斯坦還舉一個日常生活中很容易碰到的例子來說明時間應歸併在空間中的理由，</p>
<p>假定一個人要去赴一個宴會，那你就先要知道他的會址，換句話講，就是你須得先知道他的宴會的地點是在什麽縣·什麽街，幾號門牌幾層樓第幾號，同時我們還要知道是在幾點鐘舉行，</p>
<p>在這句話中，什麽縣什麽街，幾號門牌，這是僅；告訴這在二度空間中的位置，幾樓就告訴你在第三度空間中的位置，幾點鐘是告訴你在第四度空間的位置，（未完）</p>

<h3>再娶與再嫁</h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>這是男女最不平等的一個問題，男的死了妻子可以再娶，而女的死了丈夫不可以再嫁，至於男的娶三妻四妾，那是法有明文，作爲犯罪論了，要知道男女的結合，當然不能以無後爲大作前提，靑春男女到相當時期，有選擇異性的須要，這是生理上一種自然的趨勢，現在時尙歐化，婚姻由本人作主，於是有假自由之名而實行濫交，這當然是不好的現象，但是從前閨女不能出閨門一步，而書上也儘載着許多偷情的事，這可見男女犯罪，是生理上促成他們的，不過我没有鼓吹犯罪的成見，</p>
<p>我所主張是一夫一妻制，男的死妻子，再娶是不生問題，因爲習慣如此，女的死了丈夫，也可儘本人再嫁，如其生前雙方感情異常，自願守節者聽，和男子自願鰥居一樣，但有激於一時之氣，而後來暗中做犯罪之事，自可在事前再聲明再醮，還可保持夫家的名譽，因爲生理上的需要，是不大光明的事，如其暗中摸索，反認爲卑鄙了，</p>
<p>還有爲了經濟問題，死了丈夫不能維持家計而再嫁，這更不可非難，女子職業呼聲雖高，眞眞能獨立的能有幾何，誰道死了丈夫，就活活餓死不成，</p>
<p>本人的意見，再娶和再嫁，完全是堂皇的事，不必假了不娶不嫁的名義，而偷偷的犯罪，諺云：「其事之不可言者，即其事之不可爲」，可以明目張膽的說的事，不必爲社會習俗，而反暗中摸索，</p>
<p>這比較很重要的一個問題，在本刋改良社會討論會中還没有會員提議，鄙人不學無才，對於這樣重大的問題，不過作一個前提，祈本會同志，賜文討論，抛磚引玉，也不負作者初衷了，</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>第三個錦囊</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>孔老爺這回討了一位千嬌百媚的姨太太進來，預備享那閨房的豔福，但是心下打算，往往聽得别人，討了一個小老婆，必定寵愛得言必聽，計必從，風吹怕痛，雨打怕驚，弄得家庭不睦，戚黨不和，應了「若要家勿和，討個小老婆，」的一句成語，現在自己倒要打定主義，不能極度的寵愛，使她養成嬌慢無禮的態度，凡事應當自决自主，對於她有怎麽讒言進獻，是當毅然决然的立時拒絶，庶可免蹈「家勿和」的覆轍哩！</p>
<p>姨太太進門了一月之後麩觀察丈夫對於她的態度麩愛是愛的，但是這個愛，覺得没有深刻化，就是她有怎麽枕邊私語，也都未肯接受，家庭中的一切政權，又不見移交她管理，於是她想丈夫長此頭腦淸健，不聽婦言，總究難使自己稱心如意地暢所欲爲呢！即是碰着了小姊妹們，也要取笑我，是個没有能力駕馭夫婿的蠢才哩！</p>
<p>她於是就用一椿小事去要求他，試探他對於自己的話，究竟能否容納，但是結果，仍舊言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，絲毫没有容納的希望。</p>
<p>她暗暗打算，倒主意拿得堅定啊，呸！不怕的，，我是有法兒，擺佈你，使你拜倒我的胖腿之下，也要把我認爲參謀總長，而唯命是聽地，事事由我的指揮哩！</p>
<p>這天她就行法了，見他走進房來，就要求他速即别營金屋，與大老婆另行分居，但是他聽了她的話之後，仍舊唯唯否否，没有容納的表示，於是她就咽咽的大哭起來了，一頭哭，一頭威逼地要求着，那知他心腸硬得和鐡石一般，任你怎樣哭天哭地，始終不肯允許你的要求，她見第一個法子勿靈，就進一步開始第二個妙計，向他說：「你不答應我的的話，我就馬上死給你看！」說着跑到床上，拿了一條褲帶，照準𩓐子上一套，佯作投環的形狀，豈知他見了，竟</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>也不來睞你，而跑向外邊去了，她想他的老主見，眞的堅定了，這樣恫嚇的妙計，還不見效，那嗎，非得用第三個錦膏，一定難收最後的勝利，於是即忙抛却褲帶，急急地追到外邊，將他攔腰抱住，堆着滿臉笑容，把鮮　得像玫瑰的臉子，去偎他的鬍鬚根子，嘴裏還撒嬌撒痴地說：「你倒不要我了嗎？我倒捨不得你而死呢！」同時兩隻雪白的尖尖玉手，又不住地在他身上，上面下面，撫摩着，咦！妙計啊妙計，她這樣地一來，他竟滿嘴裏說：「愛人啊！好了，好了，别這樣說吧！我也捨不得你啊，明天遷居便了………」兒女情長，英雄氣短，他堅决的意志，經了她一陣迷湯之後，就此軟化了，一到明天，果眞喬遷他去，自此以後，他對她也就身不由主的，言必聽，計必從，實現「家勿和」的政策了。</p>
<p>孽障</p>
<h3>下塲？</h3>
<p>— 昂英</p>
<p>昨天碰到楊君，劈首第一句便問他：「新夫人很好吧？滿意了吧？」我這話談出來，頓時使楊君那憔悴的面孔更覺得灰黯，我心想事情一定不妙了！聽他幽鬱的說：</p>
<p>「别提起吧丨新夫人……我恨那妖怪！」</p>
<p>「那麽，你不喜歡她……？你們没結婚吧？」</p>
<p>這一問更使他面色灰白，說：「已…已經結過婚了！」</p>
<p>「什麽？你不是說不喜歡她，你爲什麽還和她結婚呢？」</p>
<p>「這……」他好像有難言之隱，終於說下去：「老友！你知道，我一踏進家裏，心裏是打算向家庭提出解除婚約的：但是·當我一提出這問題的時候，我的爸爸便咆哮如雷，媽媽唏唏的哭着·駡我讀書没出息，越讀越糊塗：連父母作主的媳婦也反對起來，這還了得丨何况這是小孩子的時候就定親了的，兩家都是大門風呢丨第二天，她的父親也知道了，來我家裏，說是：如果要解除婚約，那麽，他要同我的父親打官司丨我的爸爸對我提出哀的美頓書，說如果我不和李家的女兒結婚，就呌我滾蛋丨永不要得到家庭一錢的接濟……這些都是一根根的冷箭兒剌進我的心房。爲了怕脫離家庭和學校會使我没得飯吃，（你是知道的，一個大學生能找到飯吃嗎？）於是我屈服了……」</p>
<p>我抽了一口氣：「那麽，你想同她過一生了嗎？」</p>
<p>「不丨等我大學畢了業，生活有着落時，要同她離婚的丨」</p>
<p>「只要你没同她發生肉體關係！」我很快就說。楊君臉色一變現出一種痛苦的痙　，呐呐的說：「已經發生過了！呵！」我聽了心頭像淋了一盆冷水，毫不客氣的對他說：</p>
<p>「老楊！這是不對的丨你說不愛她，還希望有一朝要同她離婚；然而，你又同她發生肉體關係！這是何等矛盾丨他們那班封建式的人便可以根據這一點攻擊你丨你要怎樣下塲呢？」</p>
<p>他臉色靑白，「可是，稱個人同床睡，誰會相信……？」</p>
<p>「這是可以用醫生來檢騐的！」我說。</p>
<p>「那麽，現在要怎樣呢？」他額上的靑筋兒根根暴露着。</p>
<p>「要怎樣？老楊丨你也别相信畢了業，生活就有着落，多多少少的學士都在碰壁呢？對於這件婚事，完全由你自己意志薄弱丨苟安，幻想，衝動……以後怎麽下塲呢？」</p>
<p>楊君呆呆的望着地，「下塲？」他顫聲的說。</p>
<p>談天說地</p>

<h3>Jilin Righteous Army Attacks Harbin</h3>
<p>(Beijing) The Jilin Righteous Army is currently attacking Harbin and making considerable progress, now about twenty miles from Harbin. Shuangchengpu, thirty miles south of Harbin, and Acheng, twenty-three miles east of Harbin, are said to have been occupied by the Righteous Army. The situation in Jilin is also critical, and martial law has been declared because Wang Delin's troops are now joining forces with the Righteous Army to attack Jilin City. Ma Zhanshan telegraphed news of victory, saying that he had joined forces with the Righteous Army to recapture Qingcheng and is now attacking Suihua. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>

(Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan's Troops Arrive at Suihua</p>
<p>(Beijing) After Ma Zhanshan's troops captured Qingcheng, in order to break the transportation links between Harbin and Xiaokui, they are actively advancing towards the vicinity of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The vanguard troops will arrive at Suihua. Ma is also deploying troops to counterattack Baiquan. The Righteous Army in the east has also joined the fighting. There will be fierce battles on the Qiqihar-Krestovozdvizhenka Line within days. The strength of the Japanese army stationed on the Qiqihar-Krestovozdvizhenka Line and the rebel army of Heilongjiang Province is about five thousand. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Ma Zhanshan's eleventh telegram arrived in Beiping, reporting that his troops are advancing in different directions and that morale has been greatly boosted due to the response of various departments. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Zhanshan’s telegraph to the government and the Yuan reported that Shen, the regiment commander stationed by the Japanese, also reported that on August 15th, he led the Dongxing Wushu Troupe to completely resolve the entire 10th Regiment of attached troops stationed in that county, killing the regiment commander Ma Zhendong and five others, and seventy-five soldiers. Dongxing, Mulantonghe, and Shang counties have been successively recaptured and are now advancing towards Hulan.

<p>Sailors Patrol on the Shore</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tonight, the Japanese warship anchored outside Xiaguan placed two machine guns on the Osaka Shosen Kaisha wharf, and sailors patrolled near the wharf.

<p>Dalai Lama's Representative Wu Mingyuan Telegrahs Beijing to Criticize the Panchen Lama</p>
<p>Please Prevent the Panchen Lama's Trip to Qinghai</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Mingyuan, the Dalai Lama's representative, telegraphed from Beijing, stating that after the National Government of the Yuan Dynasty established its capital in Nanjing and sent personnel to Tibet to express its good intentions, the representatives came to Beijing to negotiate. The three major monasteries and monks, officials, and civilians were all overjoyed. However, before long, a conflict arose between Kang and Tibet due to a trivial matter at Dabai Temple, and Tibetan affairs were shelved. Misunderstandings arose from this. The Tibetan side believes that this dispute was provoked by the Panchen Lama's subordinates. Because the Panchen Lama's offices are located throughout the border provinces, his followers travel to Manchuria, Mongolia, and various provinces in the interior to raise funds and purchase weapons. Tibetan representatives have repeatedly requested that this be stopped, but their requests have not been approved. In addition, the Central Government hesitated on the Panchen Lama's title, printing of books, salary, and granting him the position of Commissioner for Propaganda and Transformation in the Western Border. The representatives strongly argued against this, but it was ineffective. Subsequently, the three major monasteries of Tibet and all the monks, officials, and civilians issued a declaration, which the Central Government did not accept. Recently, it has been widely rumored that the Panchen Lama's weapons, ammunition, airplanes, train carriages, and baggage have all been prepared, and that he will soon be stationed in Qinghai to set up an office and train troops, and unite with border officials. As a result, the Tibetans believe that the Central Government is assisting the Panchen Lama in seizing political and religious power in Tibet. The Central Government has already sent envoys to appease them first, so it cannot conquer them by force later. However, it is undeniable that the Panchen Lama's subordinates are trying to seize Tibet by force. If the Panchen Lama goes to the border, war will inevitably break out. Regardless of the rugged terrain of Tibet, it is not easy to succeed by force. Even if the Panchen Lama wins, how can the Dalai Lama and other people be willing to accept it? If they are forced to seek help from foreigners or take other actions, it will only provide an opportunity for imperialists to invade. If the Panchen Lama fails, Tibet will not think that it was authorized by the Central Government. Tibet will not be grateful, and the Panchen Lama will never have a chance to return to Tibet. Now the Kang-Tibetan incident is gradually coming to an end. Although foreigners are using various means to operate in Tibet, the Dalai Lama has not yet been co-opted. The British want to seek a place in Tibet, but even setting up a church is not possible, let alone anything else. The best plan now is to stop the Panchen Lama and temporarily suspend his trip to Qinghai. And to accommodate the Tibetan's repeated requests for a site selection that does not harm the Central Government's prestige, to show impartiality, and to send a fair and just senior official to Tibet to seek a solution to the Tibetan problem. And to express the Central Government’s good intentions, and to investigate the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama's positions, and whether they are comparable. Whether there is a British background in Tibet and its power, it is not difficult to get the truth. At the same time, make real contact with the feelings of the large monasteries and all the people of Tibet, in order to achieve the effect of kinship and sincerity. Strive to make the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama abandon their suspicions and release their grievances, implement unity, support the Central Government, and resist foreign insults. All the Tibetan people will truly feel their kindness. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Enbo, commander of the 89th Division, telegraphed Beijing, reporting that after the division occupied Xinji, they are pursuing in the direction of Bao City. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Liu Zanting of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, after investigating Tibet, talked about Bi Laiping. For several months, Liu Wenhui sent Jin Songting, Huang Hanchen, and other three brigades to resist the Tibetan army with all their strength, and have recaptured Ganzi, Dehua, and other places. The Dalai Lama once sought help from a certain country. People from that country's southwest and Myanmar have all responded to Gandhi, mainly focusing on taking care of themselves, and have responded to the Dalai Lama's request for help with a supportive but silent attitude. In the Sichuan-Tibetan war, the Sichuan army suffered more than 2,000 casualties, and the Tibetan army suffered more than 3,000 deaths. The Dalai Lama is already in a state of isolation. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Recognition of the Puppet State and World Peace</h3>
<p>Ren</p>
<p>The Japanese Privy Council's proposal to recognize the puppet state was passed unanimously at an emergency meeting held in the Imperial Palace at 11:00 AM today and has been approved. An order was telegraphed to Mutō in Changchun to sign the treaty of recognition this afternoon. This ominous news has filled the nation with grief and indignation. However, the Japanese diplomatic authorities continue to exaggerate, proclaiming to the world that Japan's recognition will greatly contribute to world peace and the maintenance of peace in the Far East. Alas, the term "world peace" has long been used by the Japanese to deceive the great powers and seek cooperation. Yet, the foundation of true peace has long been destroyed by Japanese atrocities. All nations of the world are aware of this. The Japanese imperialists, relying on their military power, stubbornly pursue their own course, carving up Chinese territory. First, they created a puppet state beforehand, and then recognized it afterward, step by step. This has driven the peace-loving Chinese nation into an unbearable desperate situation. If, unfortunately, a conflict breaks out due to the entanglement of circumstances, the inability to maintain world peace may be readily foreseen. The creation of a new, troubled global situation will be triggered by this.</p>
<p>Among the great powers most related to the China problem today, besides the United States, are Japan, France, and Great Britain. The common political trends among these three countries and their mutual restraint regarding the equitable distribution of interests in China prevent any one country from interfering with the actions of another. This is one reason why Japan has invaded our Northeast without any hesitation. Furthermore, the power of the Soviet Union is growing daily, and all countries regard it as their sole immediate enemy, forming two major blocs in the world today: the Soviet Union and the non-Soviet Union. In order to consolidate their external strength, the great powers must do their utmost to avoid internal strife. This is the second reason why Japan has invaded our Northeast without any hesitation. Those countries that were victorious in the European war, if they show any ambition to dominate in Europe, are inevitably envied. Therefore, these victorious nations must seek an ally in Asia to assist them. The only country in Asia suitable as an ally is Japan. If they want to enlist Japan as an ally, they must first give Japan convenience. Having obtained this tacit understanding, Japan can do as it pleases. This is the third reason why Japan has invaded our Northeast without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Since the Great War, the world's overproduction has piled up like mountains. Therefore, in order to develop their sales channels, the great powers must use political and military power as a backing to seek a new division of the world. However, they are all hesitant about implementing this division and dare not act rashly. Now, Japan's brazen recognition of the puppet state and division of our Northeast territory is tantamount to initiating the division and turning the key to a major global upheaval. This is one aspect. In recent years, conflicts among the world's great powers have become increasingly apparent. Although disarmament conferences are frequently held, the intention to prepare for war is becoming more urgent. Therefore, in order to obtain raw materials for war, all countries must seek to reacquire colonies around the world. Japan has already seized our Northeast, intending to carry out its exclusive conspiracy. What compensation will the great powers seek for what they have lost in the East? This is the second aspect.</p>
<p>In summary, from these two perspectives, Japan's launch of its ambition to invade the Northeast marks the beginning of global disputes. Although the European powers may not express their views immediately, conflicts of interest are inevitable. Furthermore, the deterioration of relations between Japan and the United States has already presented a situation of mutual antagonism awaiting an opportunity to strike. If the open-door policy in China is broken, and the European powers revert to their former so-called spheres of influence to seek a balance of power, then the Asian problems that follow the fall of our Northeast will be ten or a hundred times more severe than they are today. Therefore, unless our country urgently uses military force to suppress the puppet state, or the great powers make a fully rational judgment, how can the future of world peace be assured?</p>

<h3>Japan Recognizes the Puppet Organization</h3>
<p>Privy Council Emergency Meeting Passes Resolution</p>
<p>Approved by the Emperor, Mutō Instructed to Sign Puppet Treaty, Decision to Publish Declaration Officially Recognizing on the 15th</p>
<p>International Situation Expected to Become Increasingly Severe</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Den-tsu) – The Privy Council held a plenary session at 11:00 AM today in the Phoenix Hall of the Imperial Palace, with the Emperor in attendance. At 11:05 AM, the "Manchukuo" recognition bill was unanimously passed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Hua-lian) – The Japanese Privy Council convened its plenary session in the Imperial Palace at 10:00 AM this morning to discuss the basic matters related to the recognition of the puppet state of Manchukuo. Attendees included Speaker Kura-tomi, Deputy Speaker Hiranuma, and other privy councilors. From the government side, Prime Minister Saitō, Foreign Minister Uchida, Colonial Affairs Minister Nagai, Army Minister Araki, and Chief of the Legislation Bureau were present. During the session, a privy councilor questioned that if Japan recognizes Manchukuo, the international impact would be significant, and the future relationship between China and Japan is cause for great concern. He hoped that everyone would carefully discuss the matter. Many advocated for prudence.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Den-tsu) – The basic terms for the recognition of "Manchukuo" were passed by the Privy Council plenary session today. The government will request the relevant documents. A cabinet meeting will be held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 1:30 PM today to review the content of the Imperial government's declaration to be issued to China and abroad when recognizing on the 15th. After the declaration is approved by the Emperor through the Foreign Minister, it will be telegraphed to the Plenipotentiary Mutō. Plenipotentiary Mutō will formally sign the basic terms with Prime Minister Zheng Xiaoxu of the State Council in Changchun at 10:00 AM on the 15th.

At the same time, the "Manchukuo" government will issue a declaration in the name of the puppet Foreign Minister Xie Jieshi, requesting recognition from other countries. The main points of the declaration are divided into two sections: First, because Japan recognizes "Manchukuo," the independence and dignity of Manchuria will be further consolidated; second, it has sufficient means to prevent the infringement of the former Northeast warlords.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Reuters) – "Manchukuo" Foreign Minister Xie Jieshi told reporters that Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" would curb Zhang Xueliang's ambitions and serve as a warning to China. He hoped that China would unify soon. If internal warfare continues, it would be difficult to guarantee that a second or third independence movement would not occur.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Den-tsu) – It is reported that when "Manchukuo" is officially recognized, a new diplomatic relationship between Japan and Manchukuo will begin. Bao Guancheng, who will bear this important mission as the first representative stationed in Japan, is scheduled to depart from Changchun for Tokyo on the 17th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Den-tsu) – With official recognition imminent, important figures are frequently traveling to and from Changchun. Zang Shiyi, the puppet governor of Shenyang Province, entered Changchun on the 8th. Zhang Jinghui, the puppet chief executive of the Eastern Provinces Special District, Yu Chonghan, the puppet president of the Supervisory Yuan, and Xi Qia, the puppet governor of Jilin Province, have successively entered Changchun. The Changchun government has completely completed preparations for official recognition and is awaiting the arrival of Plenipotentiary Ambassador Mutō in Changchun today.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Reuters) – At this morning's Privy Council meeting, Okada questioned the government about Japan's relationship with the League of Nations and the great powers. Foreign Minister Uchida and Army Minister Araki replied successively. Viscount Ishii then inquired about the future relationship between Japan and Manchukuo. Araki replied in detail. Subsequently, Viscounts Ishii and Kuroda both supported the government's proposal. The government's proposal was unanimously passed. According to the current plan, the treaty will be signed in Changchun at 11:00 AM (Tokyo time) on September 15th. Mutō will represent Japan, and Zheng Xiaoxu will represent "Manchukuo." At 4:00 PM that afternoon, Tokyo and Changchun will simultaneously issue announcements of official recognition.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Reuters) – After the Privy Council plenary session, Chairman Hiranuma stated that the review committee had unanimously approved the proposal to recognize "Manchukuo" yesterday. However, the review committee, in view of the potentially serious consequences of this action, decided to express its hope that the government would give the matter very careful consideration to avoid any future mistakes.</p>
<p>Our Grievous Situation: The Japanese Prepare Grand Celebrations</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Ni-lian) – The Tokyo Prefectural and Municipal United Association of the Imperial Veterans Association has decided to hold a National Grand Celebration and Parade on the 15th, the day the government recognizes Manchukuo. Representatives will visit the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs Ministries. 30,000 students from the Japan-Manchukuo Association, universities, united associations, and middle schools will also hold a national flag parade on that day.</p>
<p>Japanese Textbooks Change the Colors of Our Northeast Mountains and Rivers</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Ni-lian) – The Ministry of Education has decided to reprint national geography textbooks because Japan will officially recognize "Manchukuo" on the 15th. The map of Manchuria will be marked with new colors to indicate that it is an independent country.</p>
<p>Preparing for War: Military Installations Increased in Taiwan</p>
<p>Taipei, 13th (Hua-lian) – In preparation for war, Japan has increased the construction of military roads, secret artillery emplacements, and airfields throughout Taiwan. Recently, the Taiwan Governor-General's Police Affairs Department also decided to increase the number of short-wave radio stations for both military and police use. The plan is to establish a central broadcasting station in Taipei, and radio receivers for military-police communication will be installed in the police stations of Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Hualien Port, Taitung, Penghu Island, and the three departments. The budget for the project is 560,000 Japanese yen. It is reported that the nature of the project is a hybrid of radio and telegraph research. It will not only enable mutual communication between Japan, Korea, and Manchuria, but also allow one side to be used by the other at any time during wartime if one side is destroyed. According to Japanese residents in Taiwan, if this plan succeeds, it will not only strengthen the Taiwan police network, making it easier to suppress the Taiwan revolutionary movement, but also expand the military deployment of the Japanese military, providing for future use in wars against the United States and aggression against South China.</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams: Unprecedented Strange Drama in the German Parliament</p>
<p>Speaker Refuses to Recognize Dissolution Order, Then Softens</p>
<p>Papen Relies on Presidential Support to Exert Authority</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 12th. An unprecedented strange drama occurred in the German Parliament today. Speaker Göring refused to recognize the dissolution order as valid and still convened the parliament to meet tomorrow. His reason was that the government had already failed and therefore could not dissolve the parliament. It is generally believed that the creation of this situation will lead to very serious consequences. Speaker Göring then suddenly changed his mind and decided to cancel his previous resolution. If Göring still adhered to the decision to continue opening the parliament, the government would inevitably prevent it from meeting and, if necessary, resort to force. Therefore, before Göring canceled his previous resolution, people were very worried that the government and the National Socialist Party would have a major conflict. All citizens who advocate peace hope that the National Socialist Party will not go to extremes. The reason why Göring canceled his previous resolution was because he received a letter from Prime Minister Papen, stating that Göring's actions of not allowing the Prime Minister to debate in the parliament and Göring's handling of the Communist Party's no-confidence motion were all illegal acts. The government then announced that after the parliament was dissolved, only the Foreign Affairs Committee could continue to operate as usual. The government will observe the development of the situation tomorrow and then submit a report to President Hindenburg on the date of the next election. Göring told people that he could not accept Papen's accusation that the parliament had adopted illegal procedures. Prime Minister Papen gave a broadcast speech in the evening, addressing the whole country, defending the government's position, emphasizing the necessity of national unity, and requesting that, especially during international disarmament discussions, the whole country must be united. How can we bear it if we are regarded as a second-class country without military protection? The cabinet will decide in a few days how to proceed with this important issue.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 13th. Although the government has been opposed by the parliament, it is determined to stay in office. Prime Minister Papen now enjoys the full trust of President Hindenburg, as can be seen from the President's signing of the parliament dissolution order in Neudeck and allowing Papen to act as he sees fit. Germans are now debating whether the action of completing a no-confidence vote before announcing the dissolution is justified. The National Socialist Party said that Speaker Göring's actions were justified, while the Center Party said that dissolving the parliament is very harmful to Germany and should be avoided. The National People's Party supports the Prime Minister and asks the whole country to do its best to assist President Hindenburg. The Social Democratic Party now accepts the dissolution order, but the Communist Party asks Speaker Göring to convene the parliament on [blank] day, fearing that Göring will not agree to their request. It is expected that if national security can be maintained, the general election can be held in early November. The government is currently insisting on its demand for military equality. All eyes are on Great Britain, and it is expected that Britain's attitude can open a path to compromise.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 12th. Yesterday's dissolution of the parliament was like a bolt from the blue. The general public, including even experienced political observers, were shocked. The news of the dissolution of the parliament and Speaker Göring's refusal to accept President Hindenburg's dissolution order immediately spread throughout the country, causing public unrest. In addition, rumors spread that if the parliament insisted on opposing the government, the government planned to declare martial law. Therefore, the public was even more alarmed. Before long, the Catholic Center Party decided not to add fuel to the fire, and advised Speaker Göring not to go to extremes. The government also announced that it had no intention of implementing extreme plans to defend the country, and then the public's heart gradually stabilized. It is expected that this dispute will be submitted to the National Court, and the parliament only said that the Supervisory Committee will convene a meeting when necessary. The dissolution of the parliament was expected long ago, but it was never expected to happen so quickly and in such a strange way. [Blank] The German parliament has never had a leader of the government refuse to address the chamber. Even other parliaments in the world do not have this kind of [blank] action. [Blank] Currently, people in the political circles generally say that Speaker Göring's refusal to allow the Prime Minister to [blank] speak is a violation of the constitution. Prime Minister Papen also stated in his broadcast [blank] speech that a few days ago, the parliament listened to the speech of Ms. Xiteqing, a Communist Party member and a member of the Third International. The National Socialist Party claims to be the sole representative of the true spirit of the nation, but now one of its main members is preventing the leader of the government from speaking to the members of parliament. Isn't that something to be cautious about? According to various sources close to the government, rumors outside that there will be changes in the cabinet in the near future, and that Defense Minister Schleicher will replace Prime Minister Papen, are absolutely unfounded. In fact, cabinet colleagues and the cabinet and President Hindenburg are now in complete harmony.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 13th. The German political situation has been extremely chaotic since the sudden dissolution of the parliament. Today, the Social Democratic Party proposed that at least part of the government's economic plan be submitted to a national referendum, which made the situation even more confusing. The Social Democratic Party in the parliament this morning has asked the Ministry of Interior to draw up a bill to abolish the clauses in the emergency order that change unemployment relief, old-age pensions, disability benefits, etc., and submit it to a national referendum. However, political circles believe that this move may not obtain the legally required number of affirmative votes. This request by the Social Democratic Party is only a step in the next election campaign.</p>
<p>Papen Broadcasts Speech on Major Policies</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 12th. Prime Minister Papen originally intended to give a speech on his major policies in the parliament this morning, but was prevented from doing so. Tonight, he broadcast this speech to the whole country via radio. He first talked about Germany's demand for military equality, saying that what was decided in Geneva was not disarmament. Germany will no longer attend the disarmament conference until the equality issue is satisfactorily resolved. Fortunately, Germany's position is not isolated and helpless. The Italian government leader has publicly expressed his willingness to support it. The French reply is currently being carefully considered by the cabinet, and its decision will be based on the country's honor and life. The Prime Minister then mentioned the economic reform plan that has been properly decided domestically, saying that the cabinet is determined to fight to solve the disaster of unemployment, and the situation in all aspects has shown a turning point. At the beginning of the cabinet's administration, there were only 50,000 volunteers, but now it has increased to 200,000. He is now responsible for issuing a very solemn warning, that is, the cabinet's plan, the safety of the country's future, depends on this, so we must implement it with all our strength. The Prime Minister then earnestly said that if the cabinet's plan fails, private enterprises will perish together. Then he attacked the National Socialist Party, saying that the party opposes the government's plan, which contains many ideals, simply because the government is not composed of party members of the party. The Prime Minister warned the members of the National Socialist Party that they should not take class hatred as a trend and fight elections, and should not use Marxist weapons, because if they use these weapons, they will inevitably be ordered by the Marxists. Finally, he said that since the parliament refused to listen to his speech, he especially petitioned the whole country. In the evening, Interior Minister Geer met with representatives of the press to explain the constitutional position to them, saying that the dissolution of the parliament was justified. The cabinet does not want to ignore the guarantees in the constitution in the upcoming election battle, but only allows this battle to proceed in the usual way, and national security must be taken care of first.</p>
<p>French Government Publishes</p>
<p>Full Text of Reply to Germany</p>
<p>Refuses Demand for Military Equality</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 12th. The French government today published the full text of its reply to Germany, the main idea of which is that the principle adopted by France is that it should not move forward to the principle of military rearmament, but should proceed in the direction of restrained general reduction of armaments. The French government is willing to do its best to reduce the burden on the people, and especially hopes to see a universal peace organization, so that security is guaranteed, so that disarmament can go further. Germany should certainly plan its national security, but it must seek international restraint of armaments, promote arbitration, and guarantee the effective implementation of international sanctions from all countries to obtain security. In addition, the reply also refused to discuss the issue of military equality only between the two parties, saying that Germany cannot rearm without the consent of all signatories to the Treaty of Versailles. In any case, there is nothing that can be done except through the League of Nations. Finally, it reiterated that France is willing to cooperate with Germany to find a formula to make war impossible.</p>
<p>Gandhi Vows to Fast</p>
<p>Resist the New Electoral System</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 13th. Because the British government has decided to stipulate separate electoral districts for "lower classes" and Muslims, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, and Europeans, Gandhi has decided to start a fast from September 20th, vowing to die without change to show his opposition to the British government's determination. The so-called "lower classes" refers to the Indian Hindus. Gandhi's intention is that the British government's decision cannot save the degeneration of the Indian Hindus. Gandhi's intention to fast was stated in his letters to Prime Minister MacDonald and Indian Minister Hall, but MacDonald said in his reply that the British side expressed [blank] about Gandhi's fasting, but in any case, the British government's decision will be maintained, because the British government's decision is to protect the "lower classes". In his letter to MacDonald, Gandhi said, "I will vow to die fasting, and use my life to oppose the British government's decision. I will no longer eat, only drink water mixed with salt and soda, or only drink clean water." Gandhi also said that his fast will begin on September 20th. If the British government agrees to cancel the new electoral system, he will stop fasting immediately. MacDonald, in his reply, asked Gandhi to reconsider his decision, because there may be misunderstandings in the meantime. Gandhi replied to the Prime Minister in a letter on September 9th, saying that he could not change his decision. Gandhi was arrested on January 4th this year for presiding over the passive resistance movement. He may be released on September 20th, so Gandhi decided to start fasting from that day. It is heard that after Gandhi starts fasting, he will move to the Sabarmati Sanatorium on the outskirts of Ahmedabad. The Indian government has now prepared everything to prevent unexpected changes, and it is expected that Gandhi's fasting can be extended for up to a month without endangering his life. What kind of reaction Gandhi's expression will have can be clear today. It is expected that the opposition National Party will propose a recess of the Legislative Council to facilitate the discussion of the new situation. When Sir Reading was the Governor-General of India, Gandhi once fasted, and as a result, a joint conference of various parties was convened. Therefore, it is expected that this time Gandhi's fasting may still lead to the same result to save Gandhi's life. Gandhi's last fasting lasted for twenty-one days.</p>
<p>Japan's Redification Advances Fiercely, Propaganda Against War to Soldiers</p>
<p>Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun said that recently, extreme leftists have been cultivating extreme left red cells in ordnance factories, and they have been very active. Although they have been repeatedly investigated and temporarily restrained, unexpectedly, the Fangbashi military police detachment recently detected the group organization of the "League of Militant Atheists" in the Huogong factory of the Army Ordnance Factory in Wangzi Town, outside the city. Among the members, newspapers such as "Red Flag," "Second Proletarian News," and "Atheist" were distributed. The two people, Kamei Ichi, a writer in the Huogong factory's work class, and Kushima Fumiko, a writer in the Fangbashi gunpowder factory, were arrested. After investigation and trial, it was found that, due to the activities of Kiyoo Motoyama, the main mountain of extreme leftism, the "no war" was promoted in the Huogong factory class, and members of the headquarters organization were contacted to plan expansion and strengthening. According to Kokumin Shinmin, Suzuki, an international proletarian youth extremist, under the instruction of a certain country, distributed extremely violent unstable documents in the name of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party on September 4, and in order to contact various aspects, various propaganda leaflets were sent by the post office, with the purpose of "thoroughly obstructing Japan's military actions." Taking the retired soldiers' group as an organizational body, it caused a nationwide communist movement. The newspaper "Red Flag" was distributed in the retired soldiers' group, and secret plans were made quite vigorously. The Metropolitan Police Department discovered the matter, and Suzuki was arrested first. However, the authorities believe that the extreme leftists are making efforts to propagandize military groups and ordnance factories, and believe that the situation is serious and have begun a strict investigation.</p>
<p>Ferry Capsizes</p>
<p>Workers at Japanese Arsenal Drowned</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 13th. A ferry carrying about 100 workers from the naval arsenal in Kure naval port sank this morning. Most of those who fell into the water were rescued, and 24 people drowned in total. The reason for the sinking was that a large ship passed by, causing the ferry to be swayed by the waves, and several women on board were frightened and moved to one side.</p>
<p>China's Salt Tax is Destroyed</p>
<p>Still Able to Maintain Foreign Debt Credit</p>
<p>British Newspapers Praise Song for Finance</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th. This morning, The Times of London criticized Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen's statement that China would pay its salt debts, praising China's efforts to maintain foreign debt credit in times of special difficulty. This effort has made a good impression in London. The Nongyou Post quoted Minister Song's statement that the authorities in power are withholding salt taxes in the three eastern provinces, which hinders the National Government's ability to pay other debts, saying that although Chinese bonds have fallen and risen again, it is not surprising that they will not rise after all.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Niu Lan Case Judgment (Continued)</h3>
<p>(Omitted) The main task of our party's Red Army is to annihilate the Kuomintang's army and order it to disintegrate and surrender its weapons, which is the right way to do it. However, this task of the Red Army cannot be done without conducting universal mass work in the party army and other revolutionary organizations' armies within white China. (Omitted B) In Shanghai, Suzhou, and Nanjing, a weekly magazine should be published for soldiers to read. (F) A special comrade should be sent to Nanjing to contact the soldiers, mechanics, and aircraft navigators of the Aviation Department, and prepare for alienation and inducement work. His duties are limited to this and do not兼任 other work. (E) Small teams must be organized in Shanghai arsenals, with party members and young party members as members. G Regarding Chiang's newly编军 army and guard, ten to fifteen comrades should be specially sent to work, and the same is true for the Nanjing garrison brigade. The original small teams there should be expanded. (Omitted) The task is the same as above. In other words, it is to instigate military rebellion, but it must be handled according to the strength of each place. (Omitted) (Exhibit A No. 70, see exhibit book No. 2, pages 131 to 137) (C) A letter from the Special Committee of the Eastern District of Hubei Province on May 12, 1931, (omitted above) As for military affairs, it was decided to declare war on the enemy with a part of the army and the people, and the other part of the army would disturb the enemy's rear formation. When Xiao Shu (transliteration of place name) and the battalion returned, they would jointly unite and fight to the death with the enemy army. The enemy army, fearing great losses, has now retreated to the city. Although we have no very modern war machines to fight in the white area, we have achieved good results. (Omitted) In the red area, we should develop propaganda work, AGIPOOOP organize the armed equipment of the people, attack the enemy at all times, step up propaganda work to the soldiers, and plan to promote military mutiny. (Omitted) (Exhibit A No. 8, see exhibit book No. 3, page 4) (D) On April 19, 1920, a letter from the Soviet Central Bureau to the Central District stated, "The enemy has not yet contacted our large soldiers. They are coming to resist us step by step. It has been decided to defeat a part of their front line. We heard that the Red Seventh and Twentieth Regiments won victories in the west of Jiangxi and are now attacking the city of Taihe (transliteration of place name), but it has not yet been confirmed. We lack many racks here and ask you to send some over. (Exhibit A No. 9, see exhibit book No. 3, page 5) (E) A letter to the Oriental Secretariat of the Communist International on June 10, 1931, stated, "The tendency of right-wing deviation is more serious than before. The reports from various countries show that the tendency of deviation has expanded. The best example of this is that the Shanghai Provincial Committee issued a leaflet on May 30th, containing the following slogans, "Down with Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial policy", "Down with the Provisional Covenant", "Down with the suppression of bandits propaganda". (Omitted) In May, the Youth League sent a comrade to western Fujian, and another to He Long's place. The Party sent Malotow (MOROTOW) to the Tenth Army, and also sent Xiuxiugen SIUSIUKE to He Long's place. In addition, it was sent to the Sixteenth Army, the Seventh Army, and the Eastern Fujian Province. The PB (Political Department) received a letter saying that Bailashiji, BRYLSKY, Komuyuna, KOMMUNOR and other 20 comrades have arrived in Zhu De Mao Zedong's territory. This letter also said that He Ying HOING arrived there on January 14, and the radio personnel also arrived. They have a radio station, but it has not been tested. The radio equipment was seized from the enemy, not ours. Our radio is still on the way. (Omitted) Therefore, by mid-May, the situation had changed greatly. Zhu Mao's Red Army has recovered many lost lands. According to reports and information obtained by the Party, Zhu Mao is now in Tung Ku, TUNGKU, and the Red Army has defeated two divisions of the enemy. One division of Gong Bingfan has been completely defeated, and one division of Shi Qiangshun SHINJANSHUNG has also been partially defeated. We have seized tens of thousands of enemy troops' munitions. In addition, our newly-compiled Sixth Division is now besieging the enemy between the Yangtze River, Shanxi, and Hubei. The three victories of the aforementioned Red Army have not completely split the Kuomintang army, but at least they have caused the enemy's ranks to enter a state of confusion, and our army has increased its strength because of it. We firmly believe that our return to Tungku (transliteration of place name) is very popular with the peasants. After the warlord occupied the area, he severely oppressed the peasants in a very short period of time. Our comrades must not repeat the mistakes of the past, but must arouse the political interest of the peasants. Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly said that he will eliminate the red bandits in three months (later changed to June), and He Yingqin even said that the Red Army has been defeated, but the result is a complete failure. The "Red Disaster" has not only not decreased but has increased. Our strength is indeed stronger than before (Exhibit A No. 13, see exhibit book No. 3, pages 17, 21, 22, 27, 28). (F) In the work of the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement in China, there is (omitted above) "The power of imperialism and the Kuomintang must be completely overthrown to achieve the purpose of evenly distributing land and revolution (omitted) In order to expand the struggle against the Kuomintang, the supporters of the Red International Trade Union must use practical methods to reveal the Kuomintang's counter-revolution. The most famous of these are Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo, the leaders of the Kuomintang left-wing. At the same time, the so-called Qing party members of Chen Duxiu's party and the counter-revolutionary Trotskyists must also be strongly opposed. These people are all pawns of the imperialists interfering in China, creating a kind of stimulating</p>

<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<p>Concerning disputes of a sexual and predatory nature, and in opposition to work and peasant revolutionary movements, the Red Labor Union should convene the masses and call out the following slogans: "Down with the Kuomintang!", "Establish Red Labor Unions in workplaces!", "Expel the Kuomintang and the running dogs of imperialism!" The Kuomintang is currently implementing its compulsory measures, forcing workers to regress in order to defeat our party" (remainder omitted). (Document A, No. 21, see Exhibits Volume 1, pages 36 and 40). (G) A notice issued by the Secretariat of Labor of the Pacific Countries on March 24, 1931, regarding preparations for commemorating the Red May Day Labor Day, states: "In China, there are currently two forces engaged in a life-and-death struggle. One is the Nanjing government of warlords, landlords, and bankers, internally divided and incompatible, with warlords vying for dominance, fighting for private interests, and serving as tools of imperialist countries, but all using brutal iron-fisted policies to deal with workers. The other is the Soviet Red Army of workers, peasants, and dozens of towns and villages in central and southern China, which is about to convene the first Soviet Congress of China. At the same time, workers and peasants in the white areas of China are increasingly active, starting to struggle, and have already launched counterattacks (such as intra-party warfare, mutinies, and struggles between new year T people) (portion omitted). It also contains slogans such as "Support the Chinese Revolution" and "Support the Chinese Soviet," (Document A, No. 47, see Exhibit Volume 3, page 92). (H) In a resolution on the China issue, it states: "The recent situation in China is sufficient to prove that the resolutions of the Sixth Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Sixth Congress of the Communist International can indeed stir up a new revolutionary upsurge in China, which is completely correct. Oppose right-leaning followers of the trend and surrenderers, as well as Trotskyists from the Chen Duxiu faction, and other waning prediction factions, etc., and in China, launching a new large-scale revolutionary movement has become a meaningless and undeniable fact. The revolutionary struggle has developed particularly rapidly and significantly in recent months. The driving force of the Chinese revolution is the working class and the peasants who have been attacked by the old party, reorganized, and engaged in revolutionary struggle under the slogans of land revolution, overthrowing the authority of imperialist rule, and eliminating the counter-revolutionary Kuomintang regime (portion omitted). In the recent combat situation, it should be known that we have not yet achieved the status of revolutionizing the entire China, and the trend of labor and peasant movements has not yet been united, and the combined groups have not yet obtained the necessary strength to eliminate the system of imperialism and the Kuomintang. The revolutionary struggle of the villagers can only develop in the southern provinces. The division and mutual war between those in power and those in control have not yet completely driven them to decline and political bankruptcy, but the recent development of the situation has the following tendency: that is, if the revolutionary forces cannot occupy the entire territory of China in the near future, they must at least be able to occupy the decisive territories of various provinces. To expedite this action, the majority depends on the accuracy of the Communist Party's tactics, and first of all, it is necessary to solve the problems of consolidating the command of the Soviet movement and its future development (Document A, No. 72, see Exhibit Volume 5, pages 1 and 3). (I) A resolution of the Far Eastern Bureau on March 18, 1931, states: "The mutiny in the 20th Army of the Red Army, disarming the military academy and parts of the 12th Army, unsealing the provincial executive committee of Kaifeng, which had been ordered to be sealed by the front committee under the influence of anti-communist groups, arresting and releasing Comrade Ilsh, who was guided by the Central Executive Committee, and slogans such as 'Down with Mao Zedong, Support Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, and Wang Kelai' (all transliterations), are undoubtedly counter-revolutionary actions. These actions are prepared and implemented by class enemies and their anti-communist groups, with the aim of destroying the front lines of our party and the Red Army, seizing the rule of our party and the Red Army, so that the Nanjing counter-revolutionaries can easily eliminate the activities of the Red Army and the Soviets. The majority of party members and the entire 20th Army of the Red Army have been deceived into the criminal activities of class enemies, and cannot reduce the counter-revolutionary elements of this action in any way (portion omitted). The order sent by the Central Executive Committee to Jiangxi regarding the December incident should be used as a new supplement to this resolution, and has been copied and sent to other Soviet and military corps (Document A, No. 74, see Exhibit Volume 5, pages 21 and 24). (J) In a conversation with his comrades Moskwin, Spriid, and Xiang Zhongfa on March 27, 1931, he generally stated that his comrades Brylsky and Communar were equal to those who arrived in Jianyan Department on March 15, 1931, that wireless radios were not easy to carry, and that the Communist Party's organizational department was split. Moskwin decided to go to Hubei Tuling to recover the 20th Army (Red Army), which was currently in rebellion, and reported that the 7th Army had 5,000 people and 3,000 guns, from Guangxi to the southwest of Hunan, back to Guangxi, and then to the northwest of Guangdong. On the way to northern Guangdong, they had fought many times with the enemy and were defeated. Now, only 1,000 people and 700 guns remain (Document A, No. 41, see Exhibit Volume 5, pages 45 and 49). In all such statements, the documents contained therein either incite the military to engage in mutiny, collude with traitors, disrupt public order, or incite the people, disrupt order, or carry out propaganda of betrayal of the party and the country. None of the records are not evidence of endangering the Republic of China, and none of the actions do not constitute a criminal fact. In such a situation, the location where the documents are compiled is obviously the communist general organ established by the Third International in China. The leader who keeps the documents and presides over everything in the general organ is undoubtedly liable for criminal responsibility. Since the evidence of the crime is clear, the party then discusses the subject of the crime. According to Noulens' confession, Room 30, C, No. 49 Nanjing Road, was rented by Ericson (also known as Alison or Aenason and Aeraison), a student of his who taught German, and the key to the room was also given by Alison. The communist documents stored in the box were also owned by Alison. When Alison left Shanghai, he entrusted Noulens to take care of it on his behalf, and he did not know what the contents were, etc. Who is Alison? Where is he now? The defendant cannot produce conclusive evidence to prove it. After searching the room, in addition to a part of the N document that is considered to be harmful to the Republic of China, there are also various kinds of general plans related to the International Communist Party. The documents are of great importance to the party. Assuming that Alison is real and has indeed left Shanghai due to an event, the party entrusted the documents to a loyal comrade in his party. How could he entrust a person who has no relationship to take care of them and hand over all the stored funds and allow them to withdraw them freely? (See Gao Er Branch Court Volume 10, Exhibit Volume 4, pages 21 and 22). Moreover, according to the testimony of the witness, according to the witness Pan A Da, Room 30, C, is where this person (referring to Noulens) lives. He has been living there since December 25 last year (1930). I call him Mr. Aenason, and he gives me four yuan a month to manage the room. Ding Zhenxun testified that the rent for Room 30, No. 49 Nanjing Road, was sent to the accounting office by him (referring to Noulens) himself after we issued the notice. He calls himself Aenason, etc. (See Gao Er Branch Court Volume 103 and 106). It is found that Pan A Da and Ding Zhenxun have no grievances with the defendant, so they should not deliberately frame him. Then their testimony is naturally true. Secondly, according to the physical evidence, (Zi) the defendant ordered a set of Western clothes from the Hexing Western Clothing Store on Sichuan Road in the name of Alison on March 5, 1931, and wrote a paper order form (see Exhibit Volume 4, page 67). (Chou) Each electricity request form from the defendant's rented No. 49 Nanjing, No. 235 Sichuan Road, and No. 66 Hede Road to the electric lamp company (see Heaven No. 4 to No. 6 certificates). (Yin) Among the evidence seized in the steel box, Document A No. 18 in German has handwritten notes next to it in ink, "Adopt conspiracy rules, pay attention to mass work", "Three o'clock or four o'clock", "Six to seven people", etc. (See Exhibits Volume 1, pages 133 to 139, and Volume 3, pages 32 to 35). According to the result of the identification by the appraiser Meisheng, they are all consistent with the handwriting of the defendant's two letters to the Meifeng Bank and the head of the police (see Exhibit Volume 4, page 48, and Heaven No. 3 certificate) and are consistent. One, the writing method in each document is written to the right. Two, the size of the handwriting in each document is inconsistent. Three, the arrangement of letters is not neat and not in a straight line. The most obvious are (1) all lowercase "s" characters have no bay at the end, (2) all lowercase "i" characters are not connected to the following letters, but are connected to the preceding letters, or not connected at all, (3) all uppercase "M" characters have a high left bay and a low right bay, (4) all "C" characters have an opening at the top and are connected to the character on the left, (5) all lowercase "F" characters bend upward and then go straight down, and do not bend upward again. The remaining "A", "M", "R", etc. are also the same (see the court's volume, August 12, 1932, transcript, and Heaven No. 1 to No. 6 certificates). Although the defendant used the appraiser as a policeman as attack material, this court has carefully reviewed the appraisal result and cannot find any impropriety. The appraisal opinion can of course be adopted. According to the above-mentioned personal and physical evidence, it can be seen that Alison is Noulens, Noulens is Alison, and Room 30, C, No. 49 Nanjing Road, is indeed rented by the defendant, and there is no other person named Alison. The files seized in the room, part of the handwriting, have been proved to be written by the defendant as the defendant's property. Then all the other documents in the same place as the document and kept by the defendant, if the defendant cannot provide definite counter-evidence to prove that they are owned by others, it can be concluded that they belong to the defendant's property. Therefore, the defendant's criminal behavior can also be determined based on it. According to Gu Shunzhang, a Communist Party member who was arrested in Hankou, after being arrested, he confessed that the Third International sent several representatives to be stationed in Shanghai on a permanent basis, which is the Far East Bureau of the International. Most of these foreigners are Russians, and there are also Poles and Germans. They do not know their names and addresses. They are said to be a faction of Khablin. The director of the Far East Bureau is named Nulun (transliteration). We call him Lao Maozi. He has a wife who is very powerful. The name is unknown. In fact, she is not his wife, but another German who was sent by the Third International to monitor him in the next room. He is a military committee member named Hotinav in Russian. He knows the development of the Red Army in Xiang, E, and Gan like the back of his hand. He used to command in the Red Zone for nine months. In China, he only receives orders from Lao Maozi. He can also report directly to the International. There are seven or eight residences in Shanghai, and the precautions are very strict. I have met him twice, once on Fuxu Road and once on Yidingpan Road, both at night. The light in the room was insufficient. In addition to Lao Maozi, there was also a Chinese man surnamed Li who worked as a translator", etc. (See Gu Shunzhang's case file). According to Xiang Zhongfa, the leader of the Red Bandits who has already been executed, after being arrested, he confessed, "The head of the Eastern Department of the International Communist Party stationed in Shanghai was Miff, and he has now returned to China. He is now in charge of a Pole who claims to be from Belgium. He is currently being held in the police station in the British Concession. The name is unknown (portion omitted). The economic source is helped by the International. The Chinese Party receives 15,000 US dollars per month and distributes it to the Southern Jiangsu Bureau, the Southern Bureau, the Yangtze River Bureau, the Northern Bureau, and Manchuria" (portion omitted), etc. (See Xiang Zhongfa's case file). In addition, what is stated, such as the names of the comrades (such as Xiang Ying, Zhou Enlai, etc.) and the duties they hold, etc., and what is recorded in the documents seized from the defendant's room are mostly the same. The transliteration of Nulun in Gu Shunzhang's confession is the same as Noulens. Xiang Zhongfa said that the person in charge of the Eastern Department of the International Communist Party stationed in Shanghai claimed to be from Belgium. When the defendant in this case was arrested, he also claimed to be from Belgium. Then, the defendant is undoubtedly the leader of the International Communist Party stationed in Shanghai. Combining the above-mentioned main evidence, it is obvious that the defendant has committed the crime of endangering the Republic of China. As for the defendant's claim that he is a representative of a German company in Berlin, engaged in the import business, and teaches German and French as a profession, and did not participate in the Communist Party, etc., when asked whether he had contacted any Chinese merchants, he had no words to answer (refer to the Supreme Procuratorate Volume 99 and the court's transcript of this month's 10th). When asked about the address of the students he taught, he could not accurately point it out. It is very clear that he is using empty words and cunning defenses.</p>
<p>(II) Regarding the Wang Deli case, Noulens was the leader of the Far East of the Third International Communist Party stationed in Shanghai, as mentioned above. Wang Deli was the person sent by the Third International to Shanghai to monitor Noulens' work, as evidenced by the aforementioned confession of Gu Shunzhang. When Wang Deli was arrested, he had twice gone to Room 30, C, No. 49 Nanjing Road, which was rented by Noulens, and used his own key to open the door and enter the room. Among the documents seized in the room, there was a French letter that was sent from Singapore to Shanghai on May 27, 1931. The words added in ink in the letter and the French note left by the defendant to Noulens (see Exhibit Volume 4, pages 63 and 65) were written in exactly the same posture. According to the identification result of the appraiser Meisheng, all characters with circles, such as A, O, C, etc., start from the low point on the left, turn to the middle of the circle, and then go down from the middle to a suitable place to end. For example, the "A" character first circles from the lower left to the point where it turns, which is in the middle of the circle. The structures and arrangement methods of the other characters, such as I, N, R, etc., are all the same (see the court's volume, August 12, 1932, transcript, and Heaven No. 7, No. 9, No. 10, No. 15 certificates). Although the letter uses a lot of code to obscure its words, the so-called "regarding investigation work", "regarding the actions of the Labor Party", "as for checking telegrams", "and in this situation, how should it be handled", "we are organizing the Singapore office", and the defendant's added sentences "three political and specialized industrial personnel" and "have already contacted Java" are all about the Communist Party members reporting their work situation to him (see Exhibit Volume 5, page 54). Since the defendant can freely enter and exit Room 30, C, and the steel box containing the criminal documents contains the defendant's handwritten criminal letters, it is clear that the room is the joint office of the defendant and Noulens. All kinds of documents in the steel box in the room are the jointly owned objects of the defendant and Noulens. Therefore, Noulens' criminal behavior is the joint behavior of the defendant, which is undoubted. The above is enough to determine the criminal behavior of the defendants and others with more than enough evidence. Let's observe from ordinary common sense, if the defendants and others have no other plans, they should truthfully state their background when they are arrested. However, they have repeatedly changed their names and nationalities, and concealed their residences and occupations. Even the amount of deposits, departure certificates, and proofs of identity are all obscured and confused at will. Moreover, the defendant has no fixed occupation, as mentioned above, and there are four addresses where he lives, and there are eight post office boxes rented, and there are as many as four registered with the Central Wireless Telegraph. Who can believe that there are no other attempts? In addition, after Noulens was arrested and put into the car, he abandoned the long-term public bus ticket and the entrance certificate to Zhaofeng Park for fear of being recognized as Noulens Hastings, and the residence at No. 66 Hede Road (see Gao Er Branch Court Volume 98). Also, when Wang Deli entered Room 30, C, he immediately showed a flustered expression when he saw the police, and apologized, saying that he had entered the wrong room, and said that he had never seen Noulens (see Gao Er Branch Court Volume 90 to 100 and the court's volume, August 15, 1932, transcript). The defendants' fear of crime and falsehood can be seen from this. Next, it is found that the defendant Noulens came to China in March 1930, and Wang Deli came to China in July of the same year. According to the photos of the Seventh and Fifth Congress of the International Communist Party presented by the South African Consulate to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the defendants and others are all photographed in it. Then the defendants and others had already organized communist groups in 1927. Although this group is not only aimed at endangering the Republic of China, since the defendants and others are international communists, what they endanger, China, is naturally also a part of it. Moreover, after the promulgation and implementation of the Emergency Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China on March 1, 1931, the defendants and others continued to come to China to work, and their purpose of endangering the Republic of China is obvious.</p>
<p>According to the above conclusion, the defendant committed the crimes of organizing a group for the purpose of endangering the Republic of China, or inciting the military and the people, or colluding with traitors, plotting to disrupt public order, and having the practice of disrupting public order, and using words to carry out traitorous propaganda, which are in violation of Article 1, Paragraph 1, Article 3, Article 4, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Article 2, and Article 6 of the Emergency Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China. According to Article 10 of the same law and Article 42 and the latter part of Article 74 of the Criminal Law, he shall be punished according to Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Emergency Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China. However, the defendants committed crimes before March 5, 1932, according to Article 2 of the Amnesty Ordinance promulgated on June 25 of this year, Article 79, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the legal punishment in Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Emergency Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China shall be reduced by one-third, and each shall be sentenced to life imprisonment, and according to Article 106, Article 56, and Article 57, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, shall be deprived of public rights for life. The various documents and three steel boxes used or prepared for committing the crime, along with the keys, six yuan, eight jiao and four cents of silver, eight hundred and twenty-three US dollars, one hundred and fifty Japanese yen, and four envelopes containing the above-mentioned silver dollars, shall be confiscated according to Article 60, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. As for the points cited in the indictment, Article 1, Paragraph 2 and Article 5 of the Emergency Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, since the defendant has no facts of colluding with foreign countries to plot to disrupt public order, and has no act of purchasing and transporting military supplies for traitors, or leaking and transmitting political and military secrets to traitors, or destroying traffic, regarding this part, a judgment of innocence should be announced according to Article 316 of the Criminal Procedure Law, especially for judgment as the main text. The case was attended by the court's prosecutor Niu Jun, who performed the duties of the prosecutor. The court of appeal in this case is the Supreme Court. If the parties are not satisfied with this judgment, they should file an appeal with this court within ten days from the day after the judgment is served, with a written statement of the reasons for dissatisfaction.

<h3>The Commander of the 27th Division</h3>
<p>Gao Shixun Dismissed</p>
<p>Because of Retreating and Abandoning Defense Lines</p>
<p>Still Subject to Investigation After Dismissal</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, Around the beginning of last month, in addition to the pseudo-fourth army corps guarding the old nest, the various units of Niu Mao, Peng Lin (Biao), Ji (Zhentong), and Luo (Binghui), the first, third, and fifth pseudo-army corps, invaded the north of Yihuang and Le'an from Ningdu and Yongfeng. At that time, Li Songkun's unit of the 25th Division of Sun Lianzhong's department was stationed in Le'an, Gao Shixun's unit of the 27th Division was stationed in Yihuang, and Guan Shuren's cavalry division was stationed in Chongren, bearing the brunt of the bandit impact. By the middle of the month, the vanguard team of the bandits, Xiao Ke's unit of the fifth pseudo-division, first captured Le'an, and Yihuang was shaken. When Peng Fei's main force arrived in Yicheng, Gao Shixun claimed that he was outnumbered and wanted to retreat. At that time, Sun received He Yingqin's order and immediately used the telephone from Fuzhou to instruct Gao to defend Yihuang to the death. However, the battle did not last a day. Gao retreated with the entire division on the 20th, and Yihuang was captured by the bandits at 2:00 am on the 21st. The bandits occupied it for ten days, losing more than a million. The people of Yi are gnashing their teeth. When Gao withdrew from the county seat of Yi Le, although the losses were more than two regiments, there were still three or four thousand people. He could have set up defenses in the Hangbu Qiuxi area on the border of Linchuan and Yihuang to protect Fuzhou. However, Gao not only lost Yicheng, but also abandoned the important Longgudu pass without defending it, and retreated into Linchuan County, allowing the Red Bandits to drive straight in and approach Linchuan, shaking the provincial capital. At that time, He Yingqin was in Lushan to retain President Wang. After receiving the news, he rushed back to Nanchang and ordered the Chen Cheng and Wu Qiewei armies to intercept the bandits from Chong. Zhou Hunyuan's division rushed to Fuzhou overnight, and Fuzhou was able to turn the tide. Now He Yingqin believed that Gao Shixun was timid and abandoned the defense area, so he urgently telegraphed Hankou to report to Chairman Jiang and asked him to dismiss Gao and investigate him. He then received a telegram approving it. He then telegraphed Gao Shixun on the 10th to remove him from the positions of army commander and division commander and await investigation to uphold military discipline (11th).</p>
<h3>Zhang Zongchang's Coffin Transported From Ji to Ping</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, After Zhang Zongchang was assassinated in Jinan, Han Fuqu, the chairman of the provincial government, purchased a coffin for his body. It was embalmed in Jinan Hospital and transported to the Anhui Township Ancestral Hall on Wanxin Street in Anhui on the 4th to await his family members to come. At first, some of his family members advocated opening a memorial service in Jinan and then transporting the coffin back to his hometown of Yexian for burial in his ancestral tomb. Later, due to various reasons, he could not be buried and it was decided to transport him to Beiping. Zhang's mother sent Wang Jinyu, the former director of Zhang Chengqi, to Jinan to handle this matter. Wang arrived in Jinan yesterday morning but failed to meet Chairman Han. He went to the provincial government again this morning and was met by Han Wenxiu, the adjutant general, on behalf of Han. Wang Jinyu stated his intention to transport the coffin back to Ping. Han agreed to order the station to prepare a car for him. In the afternoon, Guan Shilian, the director of the headquarters' station office, prepared a forty-ton flat Han Line No. 4241 iron shed car and decided to attach it to the Tianjin-Pukou Line train No. 10 heading north to Ping. Most of Zhang's old subordinates had already left Jinan. Only Wang Jinyu and Zhang's relatives who came with Wang were in Jinan to take care of him. Zhang's coffin was moved out of the Anhui Township Ancestral Hall at 2:00 pm and transported by a Duling car. It arrived at the station at 2:30 pm. The coffin was covered with yellow cloth and transported onto the iron shed car. His relatives spread reed mats on the car and sat and lay beside the coffin to guard it. The situation was extremely miserable. Zhang was a hero for half his life and was watched by the whole country. When Zhang went to Qingdao from Jinan for inspection in the 16th year, he was escorted by clouds of people. The Jiaoji Road once opened seven special trains for him. This time, he revisited Jinan. Although it was not the same as the previous situation, there were still many old friends who welcomed and sent him off. Today, his remains are transported north, and no one is sending him off. Only Wang Jinyu is taking care of him. It is also sad. According to Wang Jinyu, Zhang's family members said that no one lives in their home in Yexian, so it is very inconvenient to transport the coffin back for burial. There is a newly purchased piece of land in Nanyuan in Ping, so it was decided to temporarily bury it there. The car left Jinan at 3:00 pm and will arrive in Ping tomorrow.</p>
<p>According to Zhang Zongchang, he served as the Shandong Military Affairs Director of Rehabilitation in the 14th year and arrived in Jinan on May 7 of that year. In the 17th year, the Northern Expeditionary Army advanced, and Zhang withdrew from Jinan on the evening of April 30. He was in Shandong for two years and ten months, and then drifted to Japan and Dalian. He returned to Beiping last year. On the morning of September 2 of this year, he arrived in Jinan from Ping at 9:00 am and died at the station at 6:30 pm the next afternoon. Eight days after his death (the 11th), the coffin left Jinan and was transported to Ping. One coffin was attached to him and everything was done. The end of the warlord is also sad (11th).</p>
<h3>Western Journey Notes (21)</h3>
<p>(3) The coal seam is quite flat and thick, six feet, with soil above the coal seam, no support required.</p>
<p>(4) The selling price of lump coal is one dime per hundred catties delivered at the wellhead, fine coal has no market.</p>
<p>(5) The coal quality is bituminous coal, inferior to that of Tongguan. Charcoal easily soils hands, and it is the same geological era (Jurassic) as the Yishicun coal mine. According to the chemical analysis of the average composition of the Yishicun bituminous coal sample by the Central Geological Research Institute, the water content is 6.36, ash content 36.2, volatile matter 12.35, fixed carbon 45.08, and calorific value 5067.41.</p>
<p>Traveling west from Yaoxian Village for another eight or nine li is Cuijia Gou. Numerous earthen kilns are lined up there, all excavated along the outcrops at the foot of the mountain. Mining has been suspended because there is no market for the coal. I went down the well to inspect, and the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A vertical shaft with a diameter of four feet and a depth of fifty zhang, without supports, leads directly to the inclined shaft bottom's level tunnel for ventilation.</p>
<p>(1) The inclined shaft is six feet high and three and a half feet wide, with an inclination of about thirty degrees, facing northwest twenty degrees, with an inclined depth of more than fifty zhang.</p>
<p>(3) The coal seam is eight to ten feet thick. According to the miners, it can be as thick as thirty feet. The mining tunnel is six feet high, leaving more than two feet of coal at the top. The coal seam is topped with soil and bottomed with shale, trending northeast-southwest, dipping northwest, quite flat, some up to ten degrees. The coal quality is the same as the coal in Yaoxian Village, half lump and half fine. Coal samples have been collected and are awaiting chemical analysis. There is gas in the coal seam that can spontaneously ignite. When it catches fire, it is immediately filled with stones and sealed with mud. Now, the abandoned kilns are due to fire or water.</p>
<p>(4) The selling price is four to five dimes per kǔai (approximately 240 to 300 catties). Nearby farmers take coal mining as a side business, so they stop during the busy farming season and start during the slack season.</p>
<p>After viewing the Cuijia Gou earthen kilns, I returned to Ping. At 11:00 AM, I arrived at Jiao Town. A soldier sent by Yijun was suffering from tiger fever. The patrol officer also claimed to be sick. All three returned to the county. Two militiamen were sent by District Chief Yan to accompany me to Qilipu. I left Jiao at around 2:00 PM. The original journey was only ninety li, but for safety reasons, I detoured through Shancha, adding thirty li. That night, I stayed at Liu Jia Zhuang Ke, fifty li northeast of Jiao Town. The lodging was an earthen cave, fifteen feet wide and about twenty feet deep. The inner end was a stable, and the entrance was an earthen kiln. I slept on the earthen pit. The village chief made noodles with wheat flour, with vinegar, black salt, and spicy sauce, plus a bowl of bean pods. It was said that six families had to pool together to get this. The villagers are underfed and poorly clothed, yet they treated me like a guest, which is touching. On the 24th, I set off at 7:30 AM and headed northeast towards Qilipu. Along the way, I passed through Shancha and Baiziqiao Village, and militiamen guided me section by section. At 5:00 PM, I arrived at my destination and inspected the Zhangjiawan and Houziping coal mines. The situation is described below:</p>
<p>(A) Zhangjiawan Coal Mine is about two li southeast of Qilipu. The coal seam is four feet thick, trends north-south, and dips quite flat. The coal price is three dimes per hundred catties. The geological era is Jurassic. The coal quality is comparable to that of the Cuijia Gou area. Mining has been suspended due to slow sales.</p>
<p>(B) Houziping Coal Mine</p>
<p>(1) Location: Two li southwest of Qilipu, 93 li from Yijun. (2) The coal seam is seven or eight feet thick, trending northeast-southwest, and dipping quite flat. The roof is sandstone, and the floor is one inch thick shale. There is still a coal seam under the rock, but the thickness is unknown because it has not been mined. The coal quality is bituminous and contains a lot of sulfur iron. It is the same geological era as the Zhangjiawan Coal Mine. The coal seam contains a lot of shale, and the ash content seems high.</p>
<p>(3) The level tunnel is opened northeast from the coal seam outcrop. There are three level tunnels, one for coal, one for water, and one for ventilation. The coal-producing level tunnel is excavated at 30 degrees southeast, the tunnel is three feet high and wide, and the tunnel is 1,700 steps long (five feet per step).</p>
<p>(4) Coal is mined by opening level tunnels in the direction of the coal seam and dipping at 1,700 steps in the level tunnel. Coal is mined when it is seen, without any fixed method. Coal pillars are not left, and very little wood is used. Single logs are only used for support in dangerous places. When the coal is finished, the wood is taken out and moved elsewhere. Each miner can produce 700 to 800 catties of coal. The town stipulates that each miner who pulls coal must produce five carts of coal, each cart containing 200 to 260 catties of coal. However, because the coal seam often contains shale up to two feet thick, coal mining often cannot meet the specified amount. The coal cart is made of wood, five feet long, one and a half feet wide, and five inches high, with iron wheels on the bottom.</p>
<p>(5) Ventilation is done with wooden bellows blowing air into the tunnel, two people per shift, four people day and night.</p>
<p>(6) Lighting is done with sesame oil lamps, four to six ounces of oil per shift, and the oil price is five dimes per catty.</p>
<p>(7) Workers' treatment and living conditions: Diggers, pullers, handymen (i.e., odd-job men), and wind workers earn about three dimes per day. Lamp oil and tools are supplied by the mine owner. Food is provided by themselves, costing about two dimes per person per day. Each shift works ten hours. Commodity prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Millet 1 dime 5 cents per liter (weighing 3 catties)</p>
<p>Corn 5 cents per liter (weighing 3 catties)</p>
<p>Rice 1 dime 8 cents per liter (weighing 3 and a half catties)</p>
<p>Local flour 1 dime 8 cents per liter (weighing 3 and a half catties)</p>
<p>Vegetables 1 cent per catty</p>
<p>Pork 2 dimes per catty</p>
<p>Coarse cloth 5 cents per foot</p>
<p>(8) The selling price of bituminous coal delivered on the mine is four dimes per hundred catties, and it has been sold for six dimes when prices rise.</p>
<p>(9) There are more than 20 investors in the mine. After seeing the coal, they mine and sell it separately. Approximately three to five companies mine together in one place. The mined coal is divided equally among the companies, stored separately, and sold by each company.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 24th, I stayed at the Qilipu District Office. Tiger fever is prevalent in the town. I only ate three king corn and four eggs. On the morning of the 25th, at 6:30 AM, I left Qilipu and headed northeast to Fu County. District Chief Jiang sent two militiamen to escort me. That day, I traveled eighty li and stayed at Siyuan Town. The place is in the deep mountains, with only two shops and no other residents. I was quite wary and could not sleep. At 3:30 AM, I suddenly heard knocking on the door. I woke up in surprise and saw three passing merchants. We sat together to wait for dawn and left at six o'clock. That day (the 26th), I traveled sixty li and arrived at Fu County at 3:00 PM. From Qilipu to Fu, some say ninety li, some say one hundred li, and some say one hundred and twenty li, but in the end, I traveled as much as one hundred and forty li and took as long as two days. This was because the mountain roads were rugged (passing through eight deep valleys and eight high mountains) and I took the wrong route.</p>
<p>Other mining conditions heard along the way and in Fu County are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) There is a coal mine in Liushu Village, fifty li northwest of Central County.</p>
<p>(2) The Hulugou Coal Mine, ten li west of Qilipu, has a coal seam more than three feet thick.</p>
<p>(3) The coal kilns of the Guojia Ta Coal Mine, thirteen or fourteen li northwest of Siping Town, are by the river.</p>
<p>In Fu County, I met Mr. Xie Jiarong, Yang Gongzhao, and Hu Bosu from the Peiping Geological Survey Institute. They said that they had been to the Niuwuzhen coal mine in Zhangchuanyi for investigation, and the thickness was less than two feet, so it was not very valuable. On the 27th, I went to Ganquan with Mr. Xie. Mr. Xie and others then went to Yanchang from Ganquan via a small road. On the 28th, I arrived in Fushi and reunited with the team. Meeting everyone, we talked happily, and the experiences we had on each road made our hearts feel a lot more comfortable. (Sent from Fushi on August 28)</p>
<h3>Local Correspondence Songjiang</h3>
<p>Song County's Autumn Harvest is Abundant. The rice and cotton harvests in the county's various townships have all been abundant. However, due to the decline in rice prices, farmers, even if they harvest more, have a sense of "cheap grain hurts farmers".</p>
<h3>Verifying and Reporting Business Tax</h3>
<p>The director of the Business Tax Bureau here, Jinde, recently sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, asking it to advise various trade associations to persuade all businesses to verify and report their declaration forms. Only about one-tenth of those who have filled out the forms have submitted them to the bureau. Now that the autumn collection period is approaching, an investigation needs to be launched urgently, and it is hoped that assistance will be given in filling out the forms so that the work can proceed smoothly.</p>
<h3>Poison Pills Invade Song Territory</h3>
<p>Since red pills have become popular in various counties, they have been secretly sold in Punan and the northeastern townships of the county, and quite a few people have become addicted to this habit. It is said that, except for the urban area, there is probably no place in this area where red pills have not been imported.</p>
<h3>Seawall Project Gradually Under Construction</h3>
<p>Since Xu Baikui, director of the Songjiang section of the Jiangnan Seawall Project, took office, he has been actively planning. The new post-disaster projects include the second section of 37 zhang pile stone project, the third section of 220 zhang concrete supplementary project, and the fourth section of 160 zhang riprap project. All of them started construction in June of this year and were completed on schedule by the 10th of this month. As for the old seawall of 136 zhang in the second section, which has been in disrepair for many years, Director Xu has repeatedly requested the Provincial Department of Construction and the Jiangnan Seawall Committee to find ways to allocate funds for early construction. The Provincial Department of Construction and the Jiangnan Seawall Committee also recognized that this section was indeed dangerous and tried to allocate funds as soon as possible. It is said that as soon as the committee allocates wood and stone materials, Director Xu will raise funds as soon as possible for emergency repairs and then gradually expand them based on economic strength to achieve perfection.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Kunxing Steamer Dispute. This county's transportation business has made little progress in the past ten years. It is quite inconvenient to travel between Shanghai and Taicang. In June last year, a county resident founded a Kunxing steamer, using the latest German-style Stobick engine, which was small, stable, and fast, making it convenient for passengers. This spring, when the January 28th Incident occurred, the ship assisted the army in carrying out transportation work and was burned down in Weiting in March. After the war, the shipowner repaired it and restored it to its former appearance. However, Mao Tigan, the district chief of the eighth district of Shuangfeng, filed a report with the Construction Department to ban the ship, saying that it hindered the dike bank. However, when the ship was founded last year, it had already been approved by the administrative authorities and construction bureaus of Kunshan and Taicang counties. Therefore, it is now presenting the facts to the Construction Department, stating that it does not hinder farmland and requesting legal protection.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>County Principal Beaten. Since Principal Sang Xin took over the county's junior high school, classes have not yet officially started due to strong opposition from the students. On the 12th, Principal Sang Xin went to the school again and planned to start classes. However, because the notice to the parents of the former students involved the instigation of the old teachers, they went to the principal's office to question him. Sang had nothing to say. At that time, the students felt empathy and clamored. Some students flashed out from the crowd and beat Principal Sang once, then ran away. Sang asked after turning around, but he didn't know where they went. Then he gathered the students and held a memorial week in the dining hall. The students threw small stones, sand, bamboo pieces, and other things at Principal Sang Xin. When the newly appointed teachers saw this, they dispersed one after another. Principal Sang also walked out of the school, but the school gate was guarded by students and he was not allowed to leave. Sang escaped from the back door. The students in the school destroyed the glass and other items in the principal's office. Now the school affairs are suspended, pending the authorities' disposal.</p>
<p>The Department Orders a Secret Investigation of the Public Security Bureau Chief's Case. Pan Zhengfen, the district chief of the twelfth district of this county, was ordered to be transferred. When he was preparing the handover documents, the township chiefs of the district found that the finances were not in order and believed that the district chief had committed corruption. They immediately filed a complaint with the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments. Later, the Finance Department ordered the county to reply. Before long, the township chiefs of the district, Zhao Menghao, Wang Yinglong, etc., went to the city for business and stayed at the Daxin Hotel. It is not known why District Chief Pan reported it to the Public Security Bureau and arrested Wang Yinglong and others, accusing them of destroying the public office. Although they were explained later, they were released on bail. However, the township chiefs and others believed that District Chief Pan was holding a grudge, and the Public Security Bureau Chief Yin had arbitrarily arrested good people. They continued to file a complaint with the Civil Affairs Department and also published a warning to Bureau Chief Yin in the newspaper. The Civil Affairs Department specially sent a commissioner, Zhao Jun, to Changshu for a secret investigation. It was quite secret beforehand. Later, it was learned that Zhao had gone to the county government to investigate and summoned Bureau Chief Yin and Sun Yao, the chief of the Public Security Branch of the twelfth district, for questioning. According to Zhao, he had found some clues and returned to the province on the 11th to report his findings.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Verdict on the Love Case of Male and Female Students. Gu Weian from Funing, who was studying at Shanghai Law School, had an affair with Zhao Yueying, a woman from Changzhou, three years ago. This summer, he met Lei Peijing, the niece of the Lei Junjin, a giant family from Songjiang, who was studying at a girls' school in Shanghai, and they developed a relationship. They once lived together at No. 59 Dongfang Apartment in Shanghai. Last month, they came to Suzhou and stayed at No. 31 Central Hotel. Zhao Yueying found out and rushed to negotiate, resulting in a fierce fight. They were arrested by the police and sent to the local court. Gu Weian was detained, and the two women, Zhao and Lei, were ordered to return.

<p>Special Feature on Education News.</p>
<h3>Problems of Moral Education in Elementary Schools (Part 1) by Wu Zengjie</h3>
<p>Elementary education should not only enable children to acquire knowledge and skills, but also teach them how to conduct themselves. The importance of moral education in elementary schools is undeniable. Recently, the Ministry of Education held a meeting of the Curriculum Enrollment Committee, and the most noteworthy revision of the elementary school curriculum was the establishment of "Civic Training" to implement "Direct Moral Education." The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education promulgated a plan for the integration of moral and academic education in primary and secondary schools a few days ago. The Fujian Provincial Department of Education convened a provincial conference on moral education for primary and secondary schools during the summer vacation this year, and offered a course on "Elementary School Moral Education" at the summer school organized by the department, with the author serving as a lecturer. The emphasis placed on children's training by educational administrative authorities is evident.</p>
<p>Let us examine the current implementation of moral education in general elementary schools, which mainly involves the following:</p>
<p>(1) Children's Self-Government Organizations: Children's self-governing bodies, where students elect leaders to take on responsibilities.</p>
<p>(2) Training Week: The moral education department or moral education committee formulates implementation measures and conducts them separately.</p>
<p>(3) Rewards and Punishments: Students with good behavior are given rewards, while those with bad behavior are arbitrarily punished by teachers.</p>
<p>(4) Speeches: The principal, director of moral education, or homeroom guidance teacher gives oral admonitions to students during public gatherings, grade meetings, or evening meetings.</p>
<p>(5) Posting Slogans: Writing slogans using idioms, proverbs, and maxims and posting them in classrooms, corridors, or public places.</p>
<p>On the surface, these methods seem very sound. Those who do not think deeply may believe that this is all there is to moral education for elementary school students. However, if you think carefully, these methods have flaws and problems that are worth studying. Now, I will raise several issues that require urgent attention and discuss them with colleagues in the field of elementary education. (1) How to Formulate Moral Education Articles: Moral education articles are the basis for examining the effectiveness of moral education and for implementing it. They are not only useful for teachers, but also allow students to reflect on themselves at any time. Parents who want to know about their children's situation at school can simply see which articles of the code they are able to follow. However, compiling the articles should not be done casually. First, one must consider local conditions. Shortcomings in the local area should be given special attention. Second, one must consider the school's situation. The specific shortcomings of the students at the school should be given more training, and more articles should be listed accordingly. Therefore, articles suitable for elementary schools in Place A may not be suitable for Place B. The articles of elementary schools in the same place may not be completely interchangeable. The most important thing to note is that the articles for rural elementary schools and urban elementary schools should be different.</p>

<h3>Grass Court Tennis Open Doubles</h3>
<p>Lin Qiu Wins Replay Rights</p>
<p>Defeats Canavero Jiang Daozhang Yesterday</p>
<p>Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai played against Canavero and Jiang Daozhang yesterday in the second week of the Grass Court Tennis Association Open Doubles at the China Tennis Court. Lin and Qiu eliminated Canavero and Jiang in straight sets to win the replay rights. The atmosphere of the match was tense, especially in the final set. The results are listed below:</p>
<p>Lin Baohua Qiu Feihai 6-3 6-3 9-7 Canavero Jiang Daozhang</p>
<h3>Canavero and Jiang Unable to Maintain Balance</h3>
<p>In the first and second sets, the opening situation was very even. In the first set, Lin won the first game by serving, and Canavero et al. took it back. Then it was 2-2 and 3-3. After that, they suddenly lost three games in a row and lost the first set. The second set was also done in the same way. Canavero and Jiang took a 3-2 lead and lost four games in a row, losing another set. It was not until the third set that the situation changed.</p>
<h3>Canavero's Craftiness is Delightful</h3>
<p>Canavero, the veteran who once held the Shanghai Doubles Championship, his craftiness in delivering the ball is probably unparalleled at sea. It is a pity that his physical strength is not enough, so he has to retreat behind the young talents. In the third set, Canavero often flew a high ball full of flexibility over Lin Qiu, forcing them to retreat to the baseline and then come online to kill it. Lin Qiu was often embarrassed by this and formed the situation in the third set.</p>
<h3>The Competition in the Third Set Was Spectacular</h3>
<p>The third set was a difficult to separate situation. Each side won a game. After reaching 7-7, Lin Qiu won two more games to determine the victory. The competition was also very spectacular. Canavero and Jiang used high balls to repel the enemy and launched a fierce pressure kill, and the mutual pounce shots of both sides in the half court were also one of the highlights. It is a pity that Canavero's backhand has no fighting power, and Jiang's shot is often in the net, so although they often take the lead with a score of 3-1, they ultimately fail.</p>
<p>The audience's disturbance affects the game. When the third set was at the point where the two sides were competing for 4-4, the baseball field and football field ended, so thousands of people poured in, causing great chaos and surrounding the court on the left, right, front, and back. The game was stopped for a moment. According to Canavero's post-match talk, he could have reversed the defeat in this game, but unfortunately it was lost due to the obstruction of the rioters. He was very frustrated and hoped that the authorities would take measures to improve management and avoid leaving a bad impression on foreigners.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Football Game</h3>
<p>Tung Wah and Lincoln Draw</p>
<p>| Each Side Scores Three Goals |</p>
<p>| The Performance Was Very Exciting |</p>
<p>| Will Compete Again Tomorrow |</p>
<p>The Tung Wah football team played a friendly match with the Lincoln team at the China Baseball Stadium yesterday. This was the beginning of the winter football competition. Four to five thousand Shanghai fans watched the game and enjoyed themselves. There was still something to see. Lincoln came fiercely and scored two goals first. Tung Wah made a quick effort and scored a goal. Lincoln took a 2-1 lead in the first half. In the second half, Tung Wah's lineup was adjusted, and its strength was enhanced, and it scored two goals in a row, taking the lead. Later, Lincoln scored another goal, and the score ended in a 3-3 draw.</p>
<p>Tung Wah's Strength is Not Satisfactory - Tung Wah's formation was scattered in the first half, making it difficult to attack and defend, and there were hidden dangers everywhere. There was a risk of losing the defense from time to time. The forwards were particularly weak and had few opportunities to advance. From the second half, the team made a major adjustment, with Feng Yunyou as the central defender, Tu Kaiyuan as the right fullback, Chen Jiaqiu as the forward, and Chen Yutian changed from winger to inside forward, which greatly increased the team's strength. Therefore, it was able to win two consecutive goals. However, no matter what, the forward's strength was still not strong enough and needed to be handled well. The lineup is listed below:</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen Li Ning Feng Yunyou Shangguan Tao'an Xia Wu Youliang Feng Yunyou Xia Tu Kaiyuan Shang Chen Jiaqiu Shang Tu Kaiyuan Xia Qian Jingyong Chen Jiaqiu Xia Wan Xianghua Shang Chen Hongguang Ouyang Yongyuan Shang Chen Yutian Xia Cao Qiuting Xia Chen Yutian Shang</p>
<h3>Lincoln's Strength Remains the Same</h3>
<p>The Lincoln team was the top team in Group A last year and won the Senior Cup Finals. (Yesterday it was mistakenly called the "History of Cote Cup" championship.) The right winger KIRKHAM was particularly brave, and no one at sea could match him. The center forward, right inside forward, and central defender were also Shanghai representatives in the Interport Games of the previous year. The whole team passed the ball very well and was solid in the front and back. It was worthy of its reputation.</p>

<h3>Lost Two Goals in 20 Minutes</h3>
<p>The game started at 3:00 PM. Lincoln attacked first, and the situation was quite tense. It could not be compared with summer football. Before long, Lincoln's right inside forward passed the ball to the front of Tung Wah's goal with a swift kick, and the center forward jumped up and headed the ball into the goal. It was very agile and quick. Tung Wah was caught off guard and lost a goal. After entering, Tung Wah counterattacked several times, and the momentum was quite strong, but the shooting was not good, and the opportunity was lost again, which only made the audience stomp their feet and sigh. The attack was unfavorable, and the rear was also in danger. Tu Kaiyuan was careless in saving the ball in front of the goal and was penalized for handling the ball. Lincoln's right winger took the free kick, and the ball landed and rolled to the left corner of the goal. Goalkeeper Chen Zhongen had the foresight, but the block was slightly delayed and he was unable to save it. Within 20 minutes, Tung Wah lost two goals in a row.</p>
<p>Tung Wah Forcibly Advances - At this time, Lincoln's momentum was very strong, and the crisis was hidden in Tung Wah's gate. There was a tendency for the city gate to catch fire from time to time. Lincoln forced several corner kicks, and fortunately Lu Zhongen repeatedly resolved the danger and turned danger into safety. The forwards then went to inquire about the crime, but in a bland situation, Lincoln's two inside fullbacks allowed Wan Xianghua to reap the benefits of the fisherman, establishing a great achievement. In less than a minute, the first half ended, and Tung Wah lost 1-2.</p>
<p>Lineup Adjustment and Outstanding Surprise Soldiers - Changing sides to fight again, Tung Wah, in view of the disadvantages in the first half, reorganized its military and the strength increased sharply, and suddenly the momentum was vast and invincible. First, the shooter lost the opportunity again, and then Cao Qiuting, the right winger, made a surprise goal from Qian Jingyong's cross, and the audience applauded and cheered. In a few minutes, Chen Yutian also scored a goal, and Tung Wah suddenly reversed the defeat and won 3-2.</p>
<p>The Last Goal is Amazing - Tung Wah prospered and declined, and from then on, the downturn reappeared, and Lincoln continued to work hard and had more than enough courage to be commended. The whole army invaded, and Tung Wah was in danger again. Li Ning struggled again and again and saved dangerous balls many times. Finally, the beautiful cross from the right wing was scored by the left inside forward, who hooked the ball when it was 15 yards from the goal. With a clear sound, the ball was like an arrow leaving the string and entered the goal in response to the sound. The skill was excellent and admirable. Lincoln continued to press on, and the momentum was vast. Tung Wah worked hard to deal with it and was able to barely survive, and the score ended in a 3-3 draw.</p>
<p>The Two Teams Have Decided to Compete Again Tomorrow Afternoon - The two teams have decided to have a second friendly match tomorrow (Thursday, the 15th) afternoon, still at the baseball stadium. The fans' eyes are blessed.</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Delivers Chiang's Condolences for Wang Jingwei's Illness</p>
<p>Urges Early Return to Nanjing to Preside Over Central Affairs</p>
<p>Wang's Blood Pressure is High, Making a Temporary Return to Nanjing Difficult</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei's stay in Shanghai due to illness has caused speculation from all sides. Yesterday morning, Central Committee member Zhang Qun, bearing the orders of Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing to meet with Mr. Wang, express condolences for his illness, and urge him to return to Nanjing as soon as possible to preside over central affairs. State Council Chairman Lin Sen and Acting Premier Song Ziwen also visited Mr. Wang together yesterday afternoon. According to Chairman Lin, Mr. Wang's fever has increased, making a temporary return to Nanjing difficult. Details of each situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun's Remarks: Central Committee member Zhang Qun, previously奉(feng)奉(feng) on orders from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to go to Peiping for negotiations, returned to Wuhan on the 9th of this month to report on his mission. He left Wuhan on the 10th and returned to Nanjing, arriving in Shanghai by overnight train at 8:10 AM yesterday morning, and went directly to his private residence to rest. According to Mr. Zhang's remarks to reporters at the North Station, after the Pacification Commissioner's Office in North China was abolished and reorganized into the Military Affairs Commission, it has now begun operations. All generals have returned to their defense posts. In the future, they will resolutely adhere to the government's declaration and unite as one to deal with foreign affairs. The rumors that Zhang Xueliang is replacing Chairman Chiang to preside over commission affairs are not true. Zhang's attitude remains passive and he will go to Wuhan to meet with Chiang, but the travel date has not yet been determined. As for the situation in Nanjing, the authorities are focused on rectifying internal affairs and construction in order to restore the old image. Yan Xishan has expressed that he will listen to the central government's arrangements for both domestic and foreign affairs. I went to Wuhan on the 9th of this month to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the situation in North China and stayed for two days. Later, Chairman Chiang, because Premier Wang was in Shanghai for medical treatment, ordered me to come to Shanghai to express condolences and urge him to return to Nanjing as soon as possible to preside over central affairs. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai, I plan to meet with Premier Wang. Later, Mr. Zhang also stated to reporters that the sale of antiques by the Peiping Old Palace Museum is a matter that the outside world does not understand and has involved me. In fact, before Mr. Li Shizeng went to Europe, Mr. Li once consulted me about the position of director. At that time, I immediately declined because I was neither a scholar nor an archaeologist and not proficient in this matter. Unexpectedly, not long after, it was formally seen in an order. I immediately resigned, and although the central government did not approve, I still resigned forcefully.</p>
<p>Lin and Song Visit Wang: Mr. Wang was still not at his residence yesterday. At 2:05 PM, Song Ziwen went to Wang's residence to visit him, and was received by Mr. Wang's wife, Ms. Chen Bijun. As Song was about to leave, Chairman Lin Sen arrived, so they re-entered Wang's residence together and sat down for a brief conversation before leaving. Tang Youren visited Wang at 4:00 PM and left shortly after. Yesterday, Mr. Wang's residence remained guarded, and only his family members were busy coming and going. Furthermore, Ms. Chen Bijun carried vases and miscellaneous items by car several times in the morning, leading to rumors that Mr. Wang was moving.</p>
<p>Wang's Condition: Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. When reporters met him at Wang's residence at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, they inquired about Mr. Wang's condition. According to him, Chairman Lin (Sen) and Minister Song (Ziwen) had just left and did not meet with Mr. Wang. They met with Mr. Wang's wife (Chen Bijun). Mr. Wang is indeed suffering from illness. The normal blood pressure for ordinary people is 120, but Wang's blood pressure has recently been at 216. According to the doctor's examination of Wang's urine, not only is there a lot of sugar, but it also contains toxins. Therefore, Mr. Wang looks good on the outside. According to the doctor, if his blood pressure rises further, he will definitely become dizzy. The central government intended to have him and his doctor go to Nanjing together for treatment, and all expenses for diagnosis and medication could be covered by the central government. However, the doctor ultimately declined because the necessary examinations, equipment, and instruments could not be moved in a short time. Therefore, the matter was dropped. When Minister Song came to visit, Mrs. Wang gave Song the medical report to review. Therefore, based on this, it will not be possible for Wang to return to Nanjing in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Chairman Lin's Remarks: Chairman Lin Sen did not go out yesterday morning. Ye Gongchuo, Dai Kuisheng, Wu Kaisheng, and others visited him in the morning. Lin went out at around 2:00 PM and returned to his residence at 6:00 PM. When reporters asked him about the outcome of his meeting with Wang, he said that Wang's blood pressure was indeed very high and he was afraid that he would not be able to return to Nanjing in a few days. However, I did not meet him when I went to Wang's residence today (i.e., yesterday). Zhang Yuejun also arrived in Shanghai today, but did not meet Wang in the afternoon. As for Japan's recognition of the puppet state, it violates the Nine-Power Treaty and undermines China's territorial and administrative integrity. This matter will of course be handled by the diplomatic authorities.</p>
<h3>Jiang Guangnai</h3>
<p>Summoned to Wuhan by Plane Yesterday</p>
<p>Postponement of Return to Fujian</p>
<p>After Mr. Jiang Guangnai, Director of the Pacification Office of Fujian Province, came to Shanghai, he originally planned to take the Zhaohua Company's steamer at 10:00 AM this morning and return to Fujian with Mr. Cai Tingkai. The ship tickets had already been purchased, totaling three. Jiang, Cai, and others were preparing to depart when they suddenly received a telegram from Chairman Chiang from Hankou yesterday morning, summoning Mr. Jiang to Wuhan. As a result, Mr. Jiang, accompanied by Lu Wenlan, left Shanghai from Hongqiao Airport on Song Ziwen's Sikorsky plane at 10:25 AM yesterday morning, via Nanjing to meet Chairman Chiang in Wuhan to discuss Fujian affairs. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai today or tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Jilin</h3>
<p>Volunteer Army Commander Li Du Reports on the Battle Situation</p>
<p>The Beijing Wenri Daily forwards a telegram from General Li Du of the Jilin Volunteer Army, stating that the middle route of our army, Yang Yaojun's brigade, occupied Shuangchengpu on the 微日(wei ri)日, cutting off the Chinese Eastern Railway and threatening Harbin. The commander of the right route, Feng Zhanhai and Gong Changhai, are leading their troops to approach Jilin, causing tremors in the provincial capital and panic among the people. Most of the Han officials have fled. The commander of the left route, Wang Delin, is leading his troops westward along the Jidun Road from Dunhua, threatening Jichang and coordinating with Feng's troops. In addition, Ma Xianzhang is leading a mixed army of 3,000 to attack Yilan. The vanguard has already reached the Yanwu Settlement, five li south of the city. The battles in Jilin, Harbin, and Yilan are fierce and are all in a stalemate. It is expected that they can be taken soon. The officials of the puppet state are extremely shocked, and the Japanese are deploying troops to provide reinforcements, but they are unable to do so in time and feel extremely uneasy.</p>
<h3>Battle Report from the National Salvation Army</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the Shanghai Liaison Office of the General Command of the National Salvation Army received a report from the front line yesterday on the fighting situation of the volunteer army. The telegram states: (1) A telegram from Shanhaiguan on the 13th, a message from Changchun, the Japanese army transferred more than a thousand cavalrymen of Zhang Haipeng's troops to increase defense because the puppet capital was in danger. When occupying shops and residences, they raped and plundered, and the people could not bear the suffering. (2) A telegram from Beijing on the 13th, good news from Shenyang, the 2,000-strong volunteer army of Zhu Jiqing attacked the county seat of Faku, and the Japanese residents in the city fled in droves. 500 members of the puppet police team were disarmed. On 鱼晨 (yu chen), Japanese planes flew to Shenyang to bomb nearby villages, causing a major fire.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief of the 3rd Route of the Northeast Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Zhou Han Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Negotiates Assistance with the Support Association</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Haitao, Commander-in-Chief of the 3rd Route Cavalry of the Northeast Volunteer Army, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday to negotiate assistance with the local Volunteer Army Support Association. The China East News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Zhou at his residence yesterday. According to him, immediately after the September 18th Incident last year, he united the local militia and soldiers in the field to form the 3rd Route Cavalry Volunteer Army in October with patriotic comrades. They had fought fiercely with the Japanese bandits several times. After its establishment, many people joined one after another, and almost every village had people with guns who joined to serve. The people's anger can be seen from this. Later, due to financial difficulties and a lack of bullets, he had no choice but to divide the entire army and scatter them in Yixian, Dalinghe, Beizhen, Zhoujiatun, Xingcheng, Suizhong, Zhaoyang Temple, Beipiao, Lingnan, Chaonan, and other places, led by Wang Gechen, Zheng Xihou, and others, to continue the attack. He then came south to find a way to obtain relief. Fortunately, he received the support of General Zhu Ziqiao, so he happily returned north and reconvened a meeting of various comrades to plan the recovery of the lost territory. Although he is dull, he is determined to save the country. The troops in the Northeast fought with the Japanese bandits more than ten times. On July 17th and 18th, between Beipiao, Chaoyang Temple, Nanling, and Yixian, they destroyed the railway and, together with the Beipiao Jehol defense battalion, engaged the Japanese bandits, killing hundreds of them. Our army suffered only nine casualties, including the wounded battalion commander Zhang Shouzhen. When he left the Northeast, at 5:00 PM on August 19th, the Japanese bandits attempted to advance into Beipiao. A battalion of infantry stationed in Nanling, Jehol, engaged them. Our volunteer army divided into left and right wings, and on that day and night, they repelled the enemy, killing nearly a hundred bandits and capturing dozens. Our army is now moving behind the enemy lines between Chaoyang Temple and Yixian, cutting off their retreat and destroying railway bridges. Our army lost four soldiers and injured seven. Because our army adopted a policy of dispersing and regrouping during the counterattacks, waiting for work while well-rested, and using guerrilla tactics effectively, although the Japanese bandits' equipment was sophisticated, the volunteer army was eager to kill the enemy. It is a pity that there was no adequate supply of food and equipment. Therefore, he came south again to seek assistance from all parties and planned to contact the National Salvation Army's General Commander Zhu Jiqing's troops in order to unify command and recover the lost territory. The Volunteer Army Support Association is currently meeting on this matter and will return north in three or four days.</p>

<h3>International Trade Association</h3>
<p>Advocates Common Trademarks for the Same Industry</p>
<p>Has Applied to the Ministry of Industry for Specific Regulations</p>
<p>Prevents Inferior Goods and Counterfeiting, Making it Easy for Customers to Recognize</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Trade Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "We have investigated the Trademark Law, which is intended to protect the interests of products, using special marks as product logos to prevent others from counterfeiting and making it easy for customers to recognize. Recently, foreign goods have flooded the market, and in order to facilitate their sales, some have even taken advantage of patriotic psychology, fabricated Chinese factory names, and falsely claimed to be domestic Chinese products. This kind of unethical behavior cannot be prohibited by counterfeiting trademarks alone. The loss of our domestic goods sales is even greater than other foreign goods, so we should quickly devise sanctions to try to plug the leaks. The sixth meeting of the Board of Directors of our Association has resolved that, according to the provisions of the revised International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property Rights of 1911, various countries have enacted laws and regulations, and that corporations established by trade associations and operators with close relationships, in order to enhance their common business interests, may apply to the government to register national trademarks for use on their products and enjoy legal protection. In order to prevent inferior goods from being counterfeited as domestic goods, we can only follow the example of various countries and suggest that each trade association formulate a common trademark and apply to the Trademark Bureau for registration. All products of the same type, in addition to using their own factory's own trademark, should also use a common trademark on the product to make it clear and easy to see, so as to prevent inferior goods from being counterfeited and to make it easy for customers to recognize. On the one hand, the Ministry of Industry should formulate a specific law on common trademarks for the same industry to provide protection. We have already applied to the Ministry of Industry to stop the law on common trademarks for the same industry, and we have also written to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to persuade various trade associations to adopt it. We hereby inform you, hoping that you will vigorously promote and persuade various trade associations to investigate and handle it." It is heard that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has already sent a letter to the relevant industries for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Courtesies Exchanged Between Chinese and Japanese Military and Political Authorities</h3>

They talked for about half an hour before leaving.</p>
<h3>Incident of Japanese Plainclothes Police Causing Trouble</h3>

<p>The French Consul Has Protested to the Japanese Consul Twice</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that the case of the Japanese plainclothes police arbitrarily arresting the Chinese Pan Xiaguang on Rue Lubin in the French Concession has attracted attention from all walks of life. The French authorities also believe that the Japanese should not cross the border to arrest people, and have made a special protest.

It is heard that the French authorities have expressed satisfaction with this.</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that the French Consulate General has made two verbal protests to the Japanese authorities regarding the case of Japanese plainclothes police arbitrarily searching a Korean residence at No. 13 Rue Lubin and privately arresting a Chinese person on the 9th of this month. The first protest was made the day after the incident by French Consul Guofade to the Japanese Consul General. The second protest was made yesterday morning by French Consul General Meilai to the Japanese Consul General in person, protesting that the Japanese police did not follow the rules by issuing arrest warrants first and requesting the French police to make the arrest, and asked the Japanese authorities to pay special attention to the possibility of such actions causing disputes.</p>
<h3>Commemoration</h3>

<h3>Yu Hung-chun Discusses Preparing for Autonomy</h3>
<p>Funding and Special Zone Measures Must Be Determined Before Full Implementation</p>
<p>Neighborhood and Community Organization Cannot Be Altered by Municipal Organization Law</p>
<p>Yesterday, reporters visited Mr. Yu Hung-chun, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Autonomy Preparatory Committee, to inquire about the recent progress in preparing for municipal autonomy. He received them and gave the following statement: Mr. Yu stated that since the committee was ordered to prepare for municipal autonomy, two months have passed since its establishment. The initial decision was to establish district offices in each district before the 15th of last month to begin surveying citizens, dividing neighborhoods and communities, and then proceeding with the election of autonomy officials at all levels below the district head. Therefore, at the beginning of the committee's establishment, an outline of the survey and election process was announced, with strict and practical regulations for each stage. However, due to funding issues, the plan could not be implemented as scheduled, and the special circumstances of the city, including special zones, are a major obstacle to progress. Due to the limitations of the facts, some adjustments may have to be made to facilitate implementation. Currently, measures are being drafted for submission to the central government for approval and active implementation. Once the funding issue is fully resolved and there are measures for special zone autonomy, the entire preparation for municipal autonomy will not be difficult to initiate and actively promote, so as not to fail the expectations of the citizens and the mayor of this city. As for the organization of districts, neighborhoods, and communities, it is stipulated by the municipal organization law. The current preparations for autonomy in this city are based entirely on the municipal organization law. Under no circumstances can the central government's laws be changed. Yesterday, various newspapers in this city carried my statement that the autonomy preparation matters will be adjusted, and neighborhoods and communities will no longer be established, focusing solely on election matters. This is a misrepresentation. Perhaps the so-called adjustment only refers to the special zone aspect, which still needs to be submitted to the central government for approval before there is a solution. As for the forty autonomous districts in this city, they must be handled in accordance with the municipal organization law under all circumstances, and no changes are allowed.</p>
<h3>French Consulate</h3>
<p>Notice of Relocation of the Sino-French Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai French Consul General's Office sent a letter to this newspaper stating: "Dear Sir, please be informed that the Sino-French Association (Association Franco-Chinese) has now moved to No. 1 Rue Huysmans, Paris. This letter is to inform you."</p>
<h3>War Zone Relief Association Approves Huge Sum</h3>
<p>Totaling 250,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei districts of this city have suffered greatly from the impact of the war. The post-war reconstruction and recovery work requires urgent funds. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has repeatedly petitioned the municipal government to request the War Zone Relief Association to allocate funds for the relief of the general poor and displaced people in the district, who are suffering extremely. Upon instruction from the municipal government, the Relief Association approved the allocation of 250,000 yuan to the bureau to handle post-war relief work. It is reported that the bureau will receive the funds soon. In addition to using part of the funds as repair costs for the buildings of various charitable organizations in the war zone, the remainder will be lent out for the repair of civilian houses and for the use of commoners in starting businesses. As for the Commoners' Loan Office run by the bureau, it suffered a loss of more than 20,000 yuan due to the war. Now, the municipal government has allocated another 100,000 yuan as a fund, so that the Commoners' Loan Offices that were suspended due to the impact of the war can be restored immediately.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Meeting of the War Zone Relief Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Jiangsu Provincial War Zone Relief Committee held its sixth office meeting on the tenth of this month. (A) Report Items: (Omitted) (B) Proposed Items: 1. A letter from the Tai, Jia, and Bao sub-committees requesting the use of donations to establish memorial projects in the disaster areas. Reason: The committee has already decided to establish a relief center as a memorial. Each sub-committee should follow this intention and expand the quotas of existing charitable organizations in each disaster area to educate and care for the victims. Baoshan plans to expand the quota in the Poor Children's Education Center. Taicang plans to take in disaster victims and orphans in the Towel Training Workshop and Infant Hall. Jiading plans to take in orphans in the existing nursing home and Infant Hall. All expenses are to be allocated from the donation funds established by this office. If it is not enough, each county will find its own way. 2. Committee members Tang Weizhi and Zhu Yinjiang and others requested to discuss the case of allocating funds to the original charitable organizations in the three counties of Tai, Jia, and Bao to add quotas to provide relief to the old and weak before the establishment of the relief center. The proposal is attached separately. The above two cases were discussed together. Resolution: First, send a letter to the three sub-committees to investigate the number of old and weak people in the disaster area waiting to be supported and the situation of the original charitable organizations, report to this office, and hand it over to the relief center preparatory committee to discuss the plan. 3. The primary schools in the disaster areas of the three counties of Tai, Jia, and Bao urgently need to start school and need funds urgently. The province approved the allocation of 30,000 yuan. Should we urge again? Resolution: Director Shu has reported that he will find a way to allocate 10,000 yuan first within two weeks, and the remaining 20,000 yuan will be allocated in succession. Immediately notify each separately of this case.</p>
<h3>Cai Chang Asks for Disaster Relief for Guangdong Water Disaster</h3>
<p>Letter Requesting Allocation of Funds from the Guangzhao Public Association for Relief</p>
<p>Cai Chang of Guangzhou Daxin Company sent a letter to the Guangzhao Public Association saying, "Guangzhao Public Association, respectfully, at the end of last month, there was a heavy rain disaster in the Dongjiang area of Guangdong, which caused the villages and towns near the river basin to become a swamp. Even in Dongguan City, the water was several feet deep, and the city gate was submerged. Nearly a thousand houses collapsed, and countless people drowned. The number of people displaced is even more numerous. It is truly a rare disaster in ancient times. The water has now receded, and various charitable groups in Guangdong are sending people to investigate clearly to provide relief. I originally intended to take the Empress Liner to Shanghai as soon as possible, but this matter has not been completed, so I did not go. However, I think that Guangzhou charitable groups do not have much savings. Although I want to provide relief to the public, I am afraid that my strength is limited. The 50,000 yuan allocated by the government to Guangdong a few days ago is still waiting for Mayor Lin to complete the investigation in the northwest Jiang area before he can consider the situation. There will be no surplus money to relieve the Dongjiang disaster area. Therefore, we very much hope that the gentlemen of the Public Association will find a way to allocate funds in Shanghai to relieve Guangdong, and the people of Guangdong will benefit from the deep kindness and generosity. I will come to Shanghai as soon as the investigation in all aspects is completed and a plan is agreed upon with various</p>

<p>organizations. At that time, I will pay a visit. I am now sending you the detailed situation in advance. I respectfully express my thoughts and wish you well. Cai Chang, respectfully, 21.9.9."</p>
<h3>Academia Sinica</h3>
<p>Continuing to Investigate Rural Economy</p>
<p>Ministry of Railways Agrees to Subsidize 300 Yuan Per Month</p>
<p>The Institute of Social Sciences of the National Academia Sinica attaches great importance to the research on the economic conditions of rural areas in China. However, due to the reduction of funding this year, the original plan could not continue, which is a pity. Later, the Ministry of Railways believed that the agricultural production status and the lives of farmers were closely related to the transportation and income of passengers and goods on the railway. Foreign-funded railways, such as the China Eastern Railway and the South Manchuria Railway, set up economic investigation bureaus or investigation sections to study and report on the growth and decline of agricultural products in the provinces along the railway as a reference for the railway bureau's funding. Therefore, there was also a plan to conduct rural economic surveys. The Academia Sinica specially sent a letter to the Ministry of Railways, requesting cooperation with the Institute of Social Sciences and funding to ensure that the original plan would not be interrupted. After receiving the letter, the Ministry of Railways decided that the Academia Sinica's on-site investigation of the economic conditions of farmers was a great achievement. It decided to entrust the original rural economic survey work to the Institute for handling and allocate a subsidy of 300 yuan per month starting in August. Yesterday, the Academia Sinica received the Ministry of Railways' reply, and the original plan will continue to be implemented.</p>
<h3>Bombing on Rue Robert</h3>
<p>Pan Yitai Rice Shop Bombed</p>
<p>Shop Assistant Gong Jingen Injured</p>
<p>At about 6:20 yesterday morning, just as the Pan Yitai Rice Shop at No. 4656 Rue Robert, east of the Great Clock, was opening for business, a man dressed in blue cloth shirt and pants, resembling a worker, walked to the counter, held a letter in one hand, placed it on the counter, and shouted, "Get out of here!" With the other hand, he took out a sulfur bomb from his pocket and threw it hard on the ground. There was a loud bang, and thick smoke filled the air. The shop assistants were terrified and scattered in all directions. The man, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, took the opportunity to escape. One of the shop assistants, named Gong Jingen, a local, 26 years old, was injured in the leg by the explosion, and blood flowed like a stream. A hole was blasted in the floor, and the cabinet and floorboards were slightly damaged. For a while, the doorway was crowded with onlookers. The injured shop assistant was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. The relevant police station sent detectives to investigate the details. It is said that the shop received a letter on the 8th of this month, signed "Steel Essence Hot Blood Destroy Traitor Group," stating that it was secretly trading with the Japanese and supplying rice, etc. The shop ignored it, so yesterday another letter came, throwing a bomb as a further warning.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Railways Questions Anti-Opium Society's Telegram</h3>
<p>Responsibility for Transportation is Unrelated to Public Responsibility</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Shenbao Museum: Recently, the Ministry sent a telegram to the Shanghai Anti-Opium Society, which read: "To Mr. Wang Jingqi, Chairman, Mr. Li Denghui, Vice Chairman, Mr. Ma Yinchu, Ms. Ding Shujing, and all executive committee members of the Anti-Opium Society at No. 4 Hong Kong Road, Shanghai, upon reading the Shenbao of September 3, regarding the contents of the telegram from your society to the Supervisory Yuan requesting to stop the public opium tax, there are words such as 'The Railway Bureau is responsible for transportation, which is also related to the transportation of opium and soil. Whether this is true is not dare to say, but there is no wind without a hole.' Your society's mission is important, and issuing this irresponsible telegram is appalling. Responsible transportation has been implemented in the Northeast Eight Roads since the seventh year of the Republic of China, with remarkable results. The Ministry of Communications promulgated the General Rules for Responsible Transportation before the tenth year of the Republic of China, which can be verified. The Jiaoji Railway has continued to implement responsible transportation since it was taken over in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, which is also a fact. Last year, the Beining Railway worked hard to implement responsible transportation in order to compete with the South Manchuria Railway for freight transportation, which is even more obvious to everyone. This summer, in order to save the decline of freight transportation on various railways, the Ministry formulated procedures for implementing responsible transportation on various railways and prepared for the implementation of railways across the country. The warehouses and vehicles on the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railways were relatively complete, and the two railways were set up one after another. Regardless of whether the Jiangsu Province Opium Public Sale is true, it is not related to responsible transportation. Moreover, when the preparations for responsible transportation were completed and about to be implemented, there was no rumor of opium public sale. Where did this baseless talk come from, which is a gratuitous slander? The Daily News once published a conversation with Huang Jiawei, the director-general of your society, which also confused responsible transportation with public opium sales. The Responsible Transportation Committee of the Ministry of Railways sent a telegram to inquire, and only yesterday did the secretariat of your society send a letter, which stated that when the Daily News reporter interviewed Huang, he asked about the relationship between responsible transportation and public opium sales. Huang replied that he had not received a report on this matter and did not know the truth. The reporter then left. Unexpectedly, the next day, the newspaper published it as the official talk of Director-General Huang. The reporter had a misunderstanding. The news published by the Daily News was not a manuscript issued by this society. Therefore, your society has admitted that this news is not accurate. Why did the telegram to the Supervisory Yuan pick up baseless rumors again, which is contradictory? It must be known that in recent years, due to wars and banditry, the people's livelihood is in dire straits. Merchants across the country are under heavy pressure, and they cannot transport and sell goods safely. They only hope for the implementation of responsible transportation to relieve their transportation pain. The Ministry also knows that after years of military destruction, various equipment on various railways has been completely destroyed. However, they are not afraid of hardships and overcome all difficulties to make responsible transportation implemented as scheduled. It is the intention of the railways to strive to create a clean and honest transportation method for merchants. Unexpectedly, your society still forcibly introduced the theory of opium public sale, which is tantamount to destroying the only livelihood of merchants across the country. I don't know what your society saw and did this. Knowing that it is not true, you must slander it. I believe that the gentlemen of your society will not do this. However, judging from your society's letter, the blame for the slip of the tongue cannot be dismissed. Your society is a more organized group in Shanghai. If there is anything you do not understand about the government's facilities, you can inquire at any time. You must not use vague words to try to destroy it. If you must attach a bad name to responsible transportation and destroy it, then this is not what a wise man can bear to do. Moreover, the Chinese railways have no grudges against your society. If you say that using groundless words to slander heavily is enough to satisfy the selfishness of one or two people, then your society will not lack discerning people. I believe that you are well aware of the laws and facts, and you will certainly not be fooled by them. You should request your society to publish a correction in the newspaper immediately to clarify the facts. I am eagerly waiting for the Ministry of Railways to print the above. I hope you will check and reveal it. Ministry of Railways, Yuan."</p>
<h3>Rice Milling Industry</h3>
<p>Opinions on Responsible Transportation</p>
<p>Petitioning Party and Government Agencies</p>
<p>The Rice Milling Industry Association presented a document to party and government agencies regarding the responsible transportation of railways, which stated: "Recently, the Ministry of Railways issued Order No. 623 to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations to promulgate the 'General Rules for Responsible Transportation of Railway Freight Cars of the Republic of China' and scheduled to implement it on September 1. Although it is a measure to rectify the railway administration, the complexity of its regulations and procedures, the high transportation costs and miscellaneous fees, are a severe hardship for merchants and people, and it is an unprecedented harsh policy. Therefore, all industries feel the pain deeply and are too constrained. They have risen up to fight hard and appeal for exemption. The association is engaged in the people's food, regulating supply and demand, and transportation interests are more closely related. The opinions on the difficulty in implementing the aforementioned transportation rules have been detailed by the same industry, such as the bean and rice industry groups, and reported in the newspapers. I would like to attach them here for your consideration. I respectfully hope that you will adopt them and revise them in accordance with the law. Moreover, food is the sky for the people and cannot be lacking for a day. Although China is an agricultural country, it can barely make ends meet in years of good harvest. In recent years, natural disasters and man-made disasters have spread across the fields. Even in Shanghai, the population is larger than other cities, and unemployment is increasing day by day. The national economy has gone bankrupt, and the poor are unable to make ends meet for the day. Rice is the most important thing for the people's livelihood and cannot be compared with other goods. Now that the government is considering the people's livelihood and exempting donations and taxes, it suddenly increases transportation costs and miscellaneous fees, which is like fifty steps laughing at a hundred steps. Shanghai is not a rice-producing area, and the food supply usually relies on the interior. In the event of a poor harvest, the interior relies on Shanghai for input. In terms of transportation, railways account for the majority. Increasing harsh and miscellaneous taxes directly harms merchants and indirectly harms the people. How can the disaster victims after the calamity bear this? In his previous speeches on the issue of railway construction, Sun Yat-sen said, "If there is no railway, there is no defense for transportation, and industry and commerce are abolished. What kind of industry can be planned?" That is to say, railways can revitalize industry, but if there is no way to transport, industry and commerce will be abolished. He also said, "You must know that the revolution is not the end of the career, and everyone can enjoy happiness. Please see the compatriots who are unemployed, hungry, and cold everywhere. Can we bear to ignore them and only take care of our own happiness? How can we enjoy it for a long time? If we want to enjoy civilization and happiness, we must first ensure that everyone in the country has a permanent job, does not cry out for hunger, and does not cry out for cold, and then we can say it." It is not just a portrayal of today's people's livelihood. He also said, "Only economic problems, when they are urgent, can only abandon the root and seek the tip, because the root is often lacking in immediate effect, and the tip can respond urgently. This is also in a helpless situation, but if the root and tip are not carried out together, there will never be a day of leisure, and it will continue to fall into the place of urgency." This is not just a针砭 for the improper measures of the Ministry of Railways today. The implementation of the aforementioned rules is like robbing cold rice from a beggar? Mr. Sun once said in the issue of railway construction, "But the sovereignty of the Republic of China lies in the people. If the people think it is OK, it is OK. If everyone thinks it is not OK, it is not OK." In short, Mr. Sun's words and deeds emphasize the people's livelihood and respect public opinion in every aspect. Benevolent words are beneficial to the authorities. How should they act in a practical way to complete the legacy? When it comes to railway construction, there are strategies and plans to follow, and the public has no objections. Now, the Ministry of Railways is abandoning the root and seeking the tip, reaching the President's painstaking efforts to save the people, and increasing the suffering of merchants. The association dares to express its feelings on the proposition of saving the country and saving the people, and express its feelings: "(1) Rice should be exempted from donations and taxes, and the transportation costs should be reduced. Remove the various surcharges, miscellaneous fees, and cumbersome procedures in Articles 10, 13, 14, 15, 25, and 29 of the rules. (2) Rice should be regarded as a special commodity and should have the right to prioritize responsible transportation, except for the restrictions in Articles 19 and 36 of the rules. (3) The unloading of rice should still be convenient for storing in the warehouse for six days as usual, and abolish the unreasonable extortion of charging fees for more than six office hours. The above three requests are completely petitioning for the people because they are not only about relieving business difficulties. I hope that you will respectfully submit it to the central government, order the Ministry of Railways to follow the rules, and take care of the difficulties of merchants and maintain the lives of the people. I cannot bear the urgency of waiting for orders!"</p>
<h3>Two Railways</h3>
<p>Employee Representatives Petition the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Requesting Relief Funds for Victims of the January 28th Incident</p>
<p>During the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways disregarded danger and worked diligently, ensuring the safety of locomotives and passenger cars. They devoted themselves to military transportation and relief efforts, neglecting their families without hesitation. Once the armistice was reached, the entire railway network was restored within days. The patriotic fervor of these railway employees is truly commendable. However, the residences of employees at the Wusong Locomotive Factory, Shanghai Locomotive Factory, Shanghai Factory, and various departments of the General Bureau's Rolling Stock and Engineering Divisions were mostly within the war zone, resulting in immeasurable personal losses. Various parties have submitted petitions through the railway unions, railway administrations, and railway party branches to the Ministry of Railways, requesting the issuance of relief funds for the victims. The administrations have also forwarded requests to the Ministry of Railways, seeking the issuance of bonus payments equivalent to two months' salary, as per usual practice, to help compensate for the losses. However, despite the passage of many days, no effective solution has been found. Subsequently, employee representatives met with the bureau chief, but no satisfactory outcome was achieved. Therefore, yesterday (the 13th), on the night train, approximately twenty employee representatives from the railway's Rolling Stock, Locomotive, and Engineering divisions, led by Chen Bohua and others, standing directors of the two railways union, and Yin Maosheng and others, traveled to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Railways, hoping to achieve their desired goal.</p>
<h3>Sanyou Factory Workers' Representatives</h3>
<p>Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</p>
<p>Demanding the Factory Issue Subsistence Allowances</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the Sanyou Industrial Company in Yinxiang Township has experienced a factory closure dispute. Following the municipal government's arbitration decision, the employer has expressed disagreement and filed an appeal with the court. Regarding the workers' subsistence allowance (840 yuan per period, two periods currently unpaid), the government had previously ordered the employer not to suspend payments until the dispute is resolved. Despite repeated attempts by representatives from the 7th District Cotton Textile Workers' Union, accompanied by party and government representatives, to collect the allowance from the company, the company has repeatedly refused, citing the absence of responsible personnel. As the rice shops could no longer extend credit and were urgently demanding payment, workers selected Xia Zhongzhao, Bao Boyi, and Gong Zishen as representatives to petition the municipal government yesterday afternoon. Secretary-General Yu received them. The representatives first described the employer's suspension of the subsistence allowance and the workers' hardships, requesting that the government order the employer to provide the allowance to ensure the people's livelihoods. The Secretary-General accepted their concerns and promised to instruct the Social Affairs Bureau to expedite the matter.</p>
<h3>Qiuxin Factory Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>Labor Side Asks for Contract Revision</p>
<p>Union Petitions Party and Government Agencies for Approval</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the Qiuxin Shipyard in the Shanghai Garrison has experienced a strike involving approximately five hundred workers due to the unjustified dismissal of workers. Mediation by party and government agencies has been unsuccessful. Currently, the labor side, respecting the advice of the party and government authorities and considering the floating dock project of the Bureau of Public Works, has expressed a willingness to compromise. However, the employer continues to insist on their position, making it unlikely that the situation will be easily resolved in the short term. Yesterday, the 1st District Shipbuilding Workers' Union, citing the Qiuxin Factory's failure to adhere to the labor-management contract since the appointment of a new manager, leading to frequent disputes, specifically proposed revising the labor-management agreement to fundamentally eliminate disputes. The revised agreement has been approved by the members' congress, submitted to the factory, and presented to the party and government agencies for approval. The original text is as follows: "Regarding the petition to revise the labor-management agreement, our union's labor-management agreement has been in effect since May 1, 1931, for over a year, and according to the agreement, it should be revised. Since the new manager, McDillory, took over factory operations this spring, the original labor-management agreement has not been strictly followed, such as the arbitrary deduction of workers' travel expenses for outside work and repeated unjustified dismissals of workers, resulting in repeated labor disputes. If it is not revised, more disputes will inevitably arise in the future. Attached is a copy of the revised labor-management agreement and a copy of the old labor-management agreement. We respectfully request your association (bureau) to review and record them, and we sincerely request you to convene mediation immediately to resolve disputes, which would be a great service. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<h3>Resolution Expected in Xiangsheng Factory Dispute</h3>
<p>Formal Mediation Scheduled for Thursday</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the Pudong British-owned Xiangsheng Iron Factory declared a temporary shutdown after a small number of workers, including Zhao Fusheng, caused trouble. Mediation by party and government agencies has been unsuccessful. Yesterday, further consultations were held with the factory, which were reportedly satisfactory. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Further Mediation: Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Zhang Mingqin, Director of the 3rd District Public Security Bureau, Zhang Sheng of the 5th District Party Headquarters, Zhang Linhua and Lu Lianqing, representatives of the labor union, and translator Xia Zhenru visited the factory for mediation. They were received by the factory's manager,朋司, and deputy manager,鮑乃門. The representatives requested the factory to reopen quickly to maintain the workers' livelihoods. The factory expressed acceptance and scheduled formal negotiations for tomorrow (i.e., Thursday).</p>
<p>Union's Remarks: A Dagong News Agency reporter interviewed a responsible person from the 5th District Boat Workers' Union yesterday. According to him, the Xiangsheng Iron Factory dispute was unfortunate. The union has petitioned the party and government agencies for a thorough investigation and requested a solution. The factory also believes that 　 incident 　 only involved a small number of people, and it should accommodate the needs of the majority of well-behaved workers. Today, the Director of the 3rd District Public Security Bureau and members of the 5th District Party Headquarters are 　 mediating again, and the result 　 factory has also made concessions and agreed to formal mediation early on Thursday. It is 　 likely that the factory will reopen next Monday. In short, the union sincerely hopes 　 an early resolution to prevent any unexpected incidents.</p>

<h3>Report from the Shaanxi Industrial Survey Team</h3>
<p>Trip and Work Details</p>
<p>The Northwest Problems Research Association, organized by various circles and experts in the city, has been actively engaged in its work since its establishment. Members of the association, including Hu Shuhua, Guo Weiping, Gu Zhizhong, Zhu Qiqing, and Hu Juewen, participated in the Shaanxi Industrial Survey Team and traveled to various locations in the Northwest to conduct surveys, with the aim of contributing their findings to the central government and introducing them to the people of the country. Gu Zhizhong's "Western Travel Notes" have been published in the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers in more than ten installments. Recently, Guo Weiping also sent a letter to the association's executives, reporting that they departed from Beijing on the 3rd of last month, arrived in Zhengzhou on the 9th, arrived in Luoyang on the 11th, and arrived in Xi'an on the afternoon of the 12th, and providing details of everything that happened along the way. Excerpts are provided below for your advance viewing:</p>
<p>The People of Xi'an: The people of Xi'an are honest and simple, retaining traditional values and living a simple life reminiscent of the agricultural era. However, due to years of drought, the people's 　 have not been enlightened, superstition is deeply ingrained, and science is difficult to accept. Furthermore, they are so preoccupied with survival that they have no time for hygiene. As a result, when epidemics strike, they spread throughout the province, leaving many bedridden, which is truly pitiful. Those villagers who manage to escape the disaster are mostly 　 due to their habit of chewing scallions and garlic. In Xi'an city, nine out of ten households hang a pair of red paper trousers upside down in front of their doors, and in the center 懇 there is not 　 . Some have tiger 　 and talismans attached, as they believe that this will protect them from epidemics.</p>
<p>Survey Categories: 　 The survey team departed on the morning of August 15th, and 　 immediately split into north and south 　 , with Chairman Yang Hucheng dispatching two companies of guards to 　 security and 　 garrisoning the troops along the 　 protect them.

The southern group consisted of twenty-six members, including three agricultural and forestry experts, five mining experts, three industrial and commercial experts, two engineering experts, three economic experts, two education experts, and three journalists, along with accompanying personnel, totaling approximately forty people. As for the routes, both the northern and southern groups reversed their original routes due to the climate and the convenience of hiring mules and sedan chairs. In other words, they departed from the originally planned destination and returned from the originally planned departure point.</p>
<p>Team Members' Work: Among the survey team members, there were eighteen new and old members of the Northwest Problems Research Association. Therefore, in addition to collecting materials for the Longhai Railway, the team members also collected materials for the Northwest Problems Research Association, which were kept by member Yang Junmin for future exhibition in Shanghai to arouse the interest of the people of the country.

However, it has been abandoned for many years and no one has paid attention to it. Now, many people are competing for the land. Member He Sui has claimed 500 mu, the Zhenwu Association has claimed 1,500 mu, and Mr. Zhang Puquan plans to claim more than 1,000 mu. The remaining land will either be planted by civilians or will remain barren. It is reported that the provincial government plans to use more than 12,000 mu of land to establish a large-scale farm. Guo Weiping and Hu Shuhua plan to claim 2,000 mu for the Northwest Problems Research Association for future use as a base for new villages or industrial experiments. Work is currently underway.</p>

There are countless victims. These gangsters are numerous. If they find opium, they will force the victim into the Mantingfang and nearby alleys to extort money, even stripping clothes and shoes, stopping at nothing. Any resistance will be met with a beating. Yesterday evening, a villager named Xu from Gaoqiao Town, Pudong, was stopped and searched by the gangsters at the entrance of Baoyu Lane on Edouard Road. A box of opium and more than 30 yuan in paper money were seized. Because of the illegal possession of opium, he dared not report it to the police. Also, Mr. Cai Jishi, a lawyer, was on his way to the Second Special District Court around 9 am yesterday, on the Nanyang Bridge side, when three or four men in short clothes stopped the rickshaw, searched the bag he was carrying, and took out a gun to prevent him from making a noise.

<h3>Boiler Explosion Tragedy</h3>
<p>Yu Jinfat Burned to Death</p>
<p>At about 10:00 PM on the night of the 4th of this month, a boiler suddenly exploded at Maoxin Dyeing Factory, No. 24 Guling Road. At that time, Yu Jinfat, a Shaoxing native, 23 years old, and three others were on the scene, resulting in burns. Dai Jinshi, the manager of the store, found out and sent the four injured people to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, Yu suffered the most serious injuries and died at about 4:00 AM the day before yesterday. The hospital reported to the Xinzha patrol station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The body was carried into the Fielun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District District Court, was sent to the morgue to inspect the body. He questioned Dai Jinshi, a 34-year-old Shaoxing native who was the manager of Maoxin Dyeing Factory, who claimed that he did not know when the boiler exploded. The boiler was only bought three years ago, and at that time, it was bought in Zhabei and was warranted for five years. Now the store does not know where it is because Shanghai was at war. Yu Shuangbao, a relative of the deceased, also testified. Guo ruled that the deceased Yu Jinfat had indeed died from burns before his death and handed over the body to the elder brother of the deceased, Yu Shuangmao, who signed a statement to take the body back for burial.</p>
<h3>Pedestrian Killed by Bus</h3>

<h3>Yao Laixian Accused of Fraudulently Obtaining Property</h3>
<p>Partnership to Open Dongxin Chang Customs Brokerage</p>
<p>Prolonging and Failing to Finalize Partnership Agreement</p>
<p>Yu Kangliang, a native of Ningbo, had been a partner in the De Yichang Customs Brokerage for many years. This spring, a Yao Laixian met Yu and, after a brief acquaintance, persuaded him to resign from De Yichang and start a new customs brokerage called Dongxin Chang as partners. Yao promised Yu a monthly salary of 120 yuan as manager. Yu was swayed by this and, in April, subscribed to three shares worth 900 taels of silver. He then resigned from De Yichang to take up his new position. However, after Dongxin Chang opened, Yao suddenly went back on his word, appointing himself manager and offering Yu a lower salary than agreed upon. Yu initially tolerated this, but when he repeatedly requested the partnership agreement, Yao made excuses, claiming that the capital had not been fully collected, and delayed finalizing it. Yu became suspicious, fearing that further delays would render his investment worthless. He then petitioned the First Special District Court for a provisional seizure of the customs brokerage. The court, recognizing that Yu had already paid 900 taels as security deposit, granted the request. The day before yesterday at 2 p.m., Secretary Zhu, accompanied by police officers, Yu Kangliang, and his lawyer Xu Fuji, went to Puai Fang in Maijia Circle on Wuma Road and sealed up the Dongxin Chang Customs Brokerage. Yao Laixian was out at the time. Employees and apprentices in the store moved their private belongings out. Yao was sought out and informed that the sealing could be avoided if he could provide the amount he was accused of owing to the court. Yao then went out to find a solution. By 6 p.m., he had raised 900 taels of bank notes and handed them over to Secretary Zhu, who took them to the court. The provisional seizure order was then rescinded. However, Yu still retained Lawyer Xu to file a private prosecution against Yao in the criminal court for fraudulently obtaining property.</p>
<h3>Jia Songsheng Died of Anger After Being Extorted by Thugs</h3>
<p>Jia Songsheng, a native of Xiashi, worked for a foreign firm in Shanghai. His wife, Mrs. Zha, and their eight-year-old daughter, Guilin, rented a house at No. 314 Pingji Li Road in the French Concession. On the evening of the 5th of this month at 7 p.m., Jia's daughter was playing outside with Fengxiang, the ten-year-old son of Huang Awu, a tea server at the Wanmao Inn at No. 401 on the same road. For some reason, they began to argue, and the two children got into a fight. After being separated, three or four thugs, protecting Huang's son, argued with Mrs. Zha about compensation. Yu Afang, the owner of the Yuchangxiang Paper Store at No. 309, intervened and had Mrs. Zha give the thugs 4.6 yuan as a "longevity gift." Because she had no money, her second landlord paid on her behalf. The next day, Mrs. Zha wrote to her husband, Jia Songsheng, to tell him what had happened. Unexpectedly, Jia, upon hearing this, fell to the ground in anger and died of asphyxiation. Mrs. Jia Zha, believing that her husband's death was caused by the extortion, filed a complaint with the French police on the 10th, accusing Yu Afang of bringing thugs to intimidate her. The police chief approved the complaint and sent Detective Wen Sheng to arrest Yu and send him to the Second Special Court. Yu was detained. Yesterday, Judge Li Changnian continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Gu Shouxi, presented the case, indicting Yu under Article 370 of the Criminal Code. The plaintiff recounted the incident. Yu Afang testified that he intervened to resolve the dispute and did not collude with thugs to demand compensation. He hired a lawyer to defend himself. The court ordered the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for a later date. The defendant was ordered to post bail, or be detained if unable to do so.</p>

The robbers confined the owner's servants in a room and stole cash, jewelry, and clothing worth more than 300 yuan before escaping. After the owner reported the crime to the police and requested an investigation, special agents from the French police successively arrested the robbers Li Ahong, Li Amao, Liu Guisheng, Jiang Desheng, Jin Rensheng, and Qian Jinshan, as well as suspects Zhu Yaxian, Zhou Xinyu, Wu Yingchang, and He Sifu, totaling ten people.

<h3>Husband and Son</h3>
<p>Went to War Without a Word</p>
<p>A Woman Borrows Money to Survive and Attempts Suicide</p>
<p>According to Guomin She, yesterday a woman in her thirties attempted suicide near the Guanqiao Bund by jumping into the river from a ship dock when no one was paying attention. Fortunately, Zhu Haishan, the captain of the Shanghai Municipal Police Water Patrol, dispatched police to rescue her. She was saved and taken to the Relief Section of the Second Division of the Public Security Bureau for assistance. Xiao Shuying, a lady from the Relief Section, interrogated her. The woman refused to reveal her name. After Ms. Xiao repeatedly persuaded her, she finally said her surname was Wang. She had no one at home. Her husband and son had both gone to war several years ago and there had been no news from them ever since. As a result, she had borrowed money to survive, accumulating a debt of more than 500 yuan. Unable to repay it, she felt she had no choice but to resort to this desperate measure. She spoke through tears, requesting assistance. The woman had cut her hair and wore a diamond pin, a pointed face, a small mole in the middle of her right eyebrow, a wool qipao, a white striped Western-style short shirt and pants underneath, gray Western socks, and black satin shoes. It is reported that the bureau has sent the woman to the Xin Puyu Hall in the South City and posted a notice to find her family.</p>
<h3>The Daily Progress of the Zhonghua Iron Factory</h3>
<p>The Zhonghua Iron Factory, located in Lujiabang outside Xiaoximen, was established eight years ago and has been manufacturing machinery for various industries, receiving a warm welcome from society. Its various enamel machines are especially popular. Recently, the Qianghua Enamel Factory in Hong Kong commissioned the factory to manufacture a large batch of equipment, with the designs and structures being the latest planned by the factory. Special attention was paid to the selection of materials and supervision of the work. Most of the equipment has been completed and will soon be shipped. Given the efficiency of this equipment in enamel production, the entire batch was displayed in the factory. The factory specially invited people from all walks of life in Shanghai, as well as enamel experts, to visit the factory, evaluate the quality, and promote the products. Over twenty guests came to visit, including Zhang Gongquan, Du Chongyuan, Ye Youcai, Hu Xiyuan, Xiang Kangyuan, Zhang Huikang, Dong Xiyan, Tong Jitong, and Fang Jiangge. After careful research by the experts, all praised the beautiful design and excellent manufacturing, saying that it surpassed imported products. The factory then hosted a banquet. The guests and hosts parted happily at 3 p.m.</p>
<h3>Datong Music Society</h3>
<p>Second Batch of Domestic Dumbbells</p>
<p>Including a Pair Made of Ancient Wood from the Northern Song Dynasty, the Best</p>
<p>In addition to creating a complete collection of ancient and modern musical instruments, Datong Music Society on Songshan Road has also hand-made ten dumbbells, with materials, workmanship, and timbre comparable to imported products. Buyers rushed to purchase them, and they were sold out in less than a month. Due to social demand, a new batch of dumbbells in round and geometric shapes (40 in total) has been carefully manufactured, with the finest materials and methods. The weight is also light, making them easy to use. The bow is made of the most valuable wood, surpassing foreign goods. To promote the products, the selling price is uniformly low. There is also a special pair of dumbbells made of ancient wood from the Northern Song Dynasty. The timbre is exceptionally beautiful, long, bright, crisp, moist, and quiet. Eight characters are all present. The colored varnish makes them instantly recognizable as treasures. Unfortunately, only two were made, and they are intended to be kept in the society and not immediately sold.</p>
<h3>Liu Ziyao Has an Affair with a Neighbor's Wife</h3>
<p>Arms and Legs Slashed and Injured</p>
<p>Denies Having a Relationship</p>
<p>Liu Ziyao, a native of Wuxi and the principal of Renren Elementary School at No. 877 Yong'an Lane, Zhoujiazui Road, was resented by his neighbor Yang Changyuan, a native of Liuhe, for having an affair with his wife, Mrs. Shao. On August 14th at around 10 a.m., Yang Changyuan used a knife to stab Liu's arms, legs, and back more than ten times when Liu refused to lend him money. Liu fell to the ground and cried for help. Liu Baoshan, a Chinese detective from the Huishan Police Station, arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested Yang Changyuan. Yang Changyuan was sent to the First Special District Court and detained. The injured Liu was treated at Tongren Hospital. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong continued the trial in the Fourth Criminal Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the victim, Liu Ziyao, had recovered slightly and was present in court. Liu, dressed in Western clothing and of imposing stature, claimed that he had established Renren Elementary School and taught English, while also working as a writer in a foreign firm. He had lived in the school for seven years and had known the defendant for four years, as he had asked the defendant to teach English on his behalf, and they had become friends. He had no relationship with the defendant's wife, Mrs. Shao. During the Dragon Boat Festival two years ago, the defendant moved elsewhere, then moved to Fuzhou Road. The defendant claimed to work in the Sino-American Clock and Watch Store and wanted to borrow 100 yuan, which he refused as it was too much. Later, the defendant moved back to Yong'an Lane and asked to borrow 50 yuan, which he still refused. On July 31st and August 1st, the defendant was seen pacing and acting suspiciously in front of his door. His wife notified him to be careful. Nothing happened for several days. On the 9th, the news article published in the Xinwenbao by a Mr. Jin, which damaged the school's reputation, was likely instigated by the defendant. On the morning of the 14th at around 10 a.m., the defendant was waiting at the entrance of the lane. Liu happened to be going out and met him. The defendant said, "I'm sorry for what I'm about to do to you today," and then stabbed him in the shoulder with a sharp knife. He urgently cried out to the shoemaker at the end of the lane for help, but was stabbed two or three times. He immediately fled, but was stabbed in the leg. He fell to the ground in extreme pain, then got up again and fell down again at the water tap, losing consciousness. He also retained Lawyer Shen Xingxia to file a private lawsuit. The defendant testified that the plaintiff's statement was untrue. He did teach English on his behalf, but his English was not very good, only knowing the ABCs. He broke off contact because of the plaintiff's improper conduct. He never borrowed money twice as claimed. He denied that he published the news article, claiming that what he published was against those who abolish the world's concubine system, not damaging his school. The plaintiff and his wife did have illicit relations. Because he was tall and powerful, he was very afraid of him. When the plaintiff came towards him with his head held high, he lowered his head and walked away. Their shoulders collided, and the plaintiff pressed him down and choked him, while shouting for the shoemaker to help him. He had no way to defend himself except with a knife. Cattle have horns, horses have hooves, and people have knives to resist. The defendant hesitated to provide further details. The defendant's wife, Mrs. Shao, was not very attractive, with a sallow complexion and unfashionable clothes. She claimed that she was first lured to a small inn near the Great World Theater under the pretext of watching a play, and then repeatedly had affairs with the plaintiff in her room. In court, it was said that Liu and Mrs. Shao were having an affair. Mrs. Shao said, "This is a dishonorable and shameless thing, you shouldn't humiliate yourself." Mrs. Shao insisted that she had been repeatedly raped by the plaintiff. Defendant's lawyer, Qiu Luqi, stated that the investigation found that the plaintiff and Mrs. Shao went to the Songhe Inn near the Great World on May 27th and booked a room on the third floor, using the names Gu Dehe and Gu Li Shi. The tea server saw that the clothes and appearance of the two did not match and thought it very strange, which could be investigated. Judge Shen ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Alliance of the Sixth Road of Zhabei</h3>
<p>Responding to a Letter from the Commercial Alliance of the Tenth Road</p>
<p>Appealing on Behalf of Tenants in Shunji Lane</p>
<p>The Commercial Alliance of the Sixth Road of Zhabei, due to the fact that the landlord of Shunji Lane of the Yuyingtang (details reported in the ninth issue of this newspaper) was pressuring tenants, summoned a general meeting and worked together to assist, formally sending a letter to the Commercial Alliance of the Tenth Road in response. The public letter is recorded as follows. With due respect, we wish to inform you that the Yuyingtang Road in Zhabei Shunji Lane is heavily oppressing tenants, forcing them to pay arrears and ordering them to move out. The Zhabei people are publicly indignant. Pitying the common people in this time of disaster and unemployment, how can the government and the wealthy understand the difficulties of the people in order to revitalize the country? They are instead wantonly oppressing and arbitrarily destroying the people, not only ordering them to pay but even sealing and impounding their possessions, using every means possible. Their intention is to take the opportunity to increase rent and exploit the people. If this continues, further disputes will inevitably arise, and the Zhabei citizens will be completely forced to leave Zhabei. This method is not only an obstacle to the revitalization of Zhabei but also a blow to the livelihood of the people. For the sake of the livelihood of the people of Zhabei and for the sake of the revitalization of Zhabei, this alliance is deeply impressed by your alliance's fervent appeal and advocacy for the people. From now on, we will fight together, providing as much assistance as possible, striving to achieve the goal of alleviating the people's suffering, allowing the Zhabei people to have a way to survive.</p>

After a brief interrogation, they were sent to the bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Shen Shouchang</h3>
<p>Appeal Judgment on Child Molestation Case</p>
<p>Sentence Reduced to Seven Years</p>
<p>Shen Shouchang, a tailor from Nanjing, was sewing clothes in the room of Wang Boying, a servant of a Westerner, at No. 191 Jupeilai Road in the French Concession, on June 13th of this year. That afternoon at 2 p.m., Wang and his wife were out working. Shen saw Wang's eight-year-old daughter, Maomao, playing nearby. In a moment of animalistic impulse, he forcibly molested the girl. The mother and daughter discovered this and reported it to the police. Detective Wen Sheng arrested Shen on the 18th of the same month and sent him to the Second Special Court, which found Shen guilty and sentenced him to eight years in prison. Shen, dissatisfied with the judgment, filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Higher Court. The High Court accepted the appeal and held a hearing, declaring the debate closed. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., Presiding Judge Lu Yimei, along with Judges Guo Dexin and Fan Peien, and the prosecutor, presided over the criminal court and ordered the appellant to be brought before the court. The court ruled to reduce Shen Shouchang's sentence to seven years. After the ruling, the appellant was remanded in custody to await further instructions.</p>
<h3>Pan Lianshan</h3>
<p>Will Die if He Cannot Marry the Woman</p>
<p>Pan Lianshan, the second son of Pan Yu'an, a native of Jiangbei, who lives in a shack by the railway in Tanziwan, Zhabei, is twenty years old. He used to farm in his hometown. Since childhood, he had been betrothed to Mei Yin, the daughter of Xia Deqing, a fellow villager. Mei Yin is twenty-one years old this year and lives with her father in Tanziwan. She works in a silk factory. Influenced by the prosperity of Shanghai, she thinks highly of herself and has long held the desire not to marry the rustic boy she was betrothed to in childhood. Pan Lianshan has now grown up and came to Shanghai from Jiangbei to request marriage. His father asked Xia about the marriage, but Xia and his daughter refused outright. After several unsuccessful requests, Pan Lianshan became so angry and anxious that he swallowed poison the night before last. No one knew at the time. After the poison took effect and resuscitation failed, he died shortly after. Pan Yu'an believed that his son's tragic death was caused by the coercion of Xia and his daughter. He filed a complaint with the Fourth District, and they were taken into custody for questioning. Yesterday, the district ordered the local security officer Zhang Fengqi to report to the local court and request an autopsy.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the Reuters dispatch from Peiping published in your newspaper on the 6th of this month, which reported that according to a telegram from Chinese sources in Xi'an, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation aircraft had two accidents in Gansu Province. The first aircraft, during a test flight from Lanzhou to Mazhou, crashed in Yongchang and was destroyed. The German pilot and one Chinese passenger were injured. The sixth aircraft, which flew between Lanzhou and the capital, crashed into a mountain. Two female passengers sustained minor injuries. It is now rumored that the Eurasia Aviation Corporation has decided to suspend passenger air services on that route, etc.</p>
<p>Our company's No. 16 aircraft, during trial flights to 州 and regular flights to Luoyang, did encounter accidents, but we have repeatedly received telegrams indicating that the injuries to personnel and aircraft were very minor. The Lanzhou airport was damaged by rain, making aircraft takeoffs and landings dangerous. Furthermore, due to the recent unfavorable weather conditions, we have temporarily suspended flights on the western section of Lanzhou. We are actively repairing the airport, and as soon as it is repaired, we will resume flights. There has been no decision to suspend services on that section. The Peiping dispatch from Reuters does not correspond to the facts. We would be grateful if you could promptly correct it.</p>
<p>Regular flights on the Peiping-West and Shanghai-West routes continue as usual. Suzhou, Hami, Dihua, Xinjiang, etc. are of utmost importance for international air transportation and the development of the Northwest. Although we have experienced minor setbacks, we will continue to move forward to achieve our goals as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Combined statement,</p>
<p>To the Shen Bao Newspaper Office,</p>
<p>Eurasia Aviation Corporation, September 13th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I have just read a news item titled "Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association Meeting to Aid the National Salvation Army" in today's (12th) edition of your newspaper's local news, drafted by the Guomin News Agency. The content of the report is completely inconsistent with the facts. A Mr. Xie Jun came to the association the day before yesterday, claiming to have been sent by Zheng Guilin, commander of the 48th Route Army of the Northeast Masses' National Salvation Army, to come south to seek assistance. However, there was no official letter from the headquarters, and the route has someone in charge, making it unnecessary to provide direct assistance. The standing committee of directors has already made a decision on the matter. No plenary session of directors was scheduled for today to discuss assistance. The figures listed are also quite different from reality. The draft is based entirely on speculation and unauthorized proposals, which harm the affairs of the association. We are writing this special letter to request that you investigate and make corrections to set the record straight. We would be most grateful.</p>
<p>To the Editor of the Shen Bao Newspaper,</p>
<p>Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, September 12th.</p>

<p>One Sunday noon, I was having lunch at home when a voice came amidst the wind and rain: "Mr. Xu, the old gentleman requests your presence!" So, braving the wind and rain, I went to the Leshan Hall.</p>
<p>It turned out that teachers and students from the Labor University Nursing School had come in the rain to seek assistance. The old gentleman instructed me to send letters to the governing authorities, the gist of which was: 丨丨</p>
<p>"The National Labor University has made a unique contribution to the promotion and improvement of culture in the agricultural and industrial laboring sectors in recent years, which the state and society should initiate and preserve. It is an unshirkable responsibility: Revival is easy... etc."</p>
<p>A few days later, I received a reply from President Wang of the Executive Yuan; the Labor University was given a lifeline. I also sent letters to Mr. Cai Yuanpei and others, urging them to revive the Labor University. The cautionary sentence personally amended by Old Man Xiang on the draft was: "Establishing a nation, culture comes first: Labor is the foundation of people's livelihood." Later, when I paid a personal visit to Mr. Cai at his behest, Mr. Cai indicated that he had received this letter. Old Man Xiang attached such importance to agriculture and industry, but he did not belittle commerce; and he advocated cooperation between agriculture, industry, and commerce, as the following matter can prove.</p>
<p>Another Sunday afternoon, with some raindrops adorning the scorching summer heat. I was commissioned to participate in the Central Business College graduation party; because it was an invitation from President Xu out of great kindness. Before leaving, I asked for instructions on how to word my speech. Old Man Xiang said: 丨丨</p>
<p>"Commerce must cooperate closely with agriculture and industry丨Otherwise, it is merely what is called peddling, earning a little money moving goods around," how could that be worthy of being called a merchant? Business studies must focus on the needs of the people's livelihood, such as how to tailor clothing materials from market cloth without wasting them. Merchants must plan together with factories. The sale of agricultural products is the same. I hope those who study commerce will broaden their horizons to study!"</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes of Fu Sheng</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>(I) The Power of Officials</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "The poor don't fight the rich, and the rich don't contend with officials." In our society, even the richest people, no matter how powerful they may be, don't dare to contend with officials. The power of officials can be imagined.</p>
<p>I remember a few years ago, a person collecting house taxes came to my house. I said, "So-and-so's house is several times larger than mine, but the tax is not much different. It doesn't seem very fair." That person put away his book and said, "You say it's not fair? Come on, let's go to the county office together and argue." I said, "Okay! Let's go together." As a result, others pulled me aside.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, luckily I didn't go then. If I had gone, I would probably have had to sit in front of the iron window. Even though I am a follower of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the county magistrate would not necessarily talk to me about the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>(II) Dangerous Memories</p>
<p>Speaking of collecting house taxes, I was reminded of a dangerous incident. At that time, I was just a passionate and ignorant youth. After being scolded by the house tax collector, I couldn't help but feel resentful. So I wrote a large anonymous declaration, meaning that under the revolutionary government, the county magistrate was actually levying taxes arbitrarily and oppressing the people. We had to use the power of democracy to remove him from office. The declaration was written, but for some reason, it was not posted.</p>
<p>Looking back now, I am also glad that it was not posted 丨 If it had been posted, I am afraid that it would have been posted in the morning, and by the evening I would have been shackled and imprisoned. The next morning, I would have been escorted to the Guandi Temple outside the North Gate and executed by a bullet. The charge would have been "counter-revolutionary."</p>
<p>These things have all passed. Even that County Magistrate Yu is now nowhere to be found. However, I think that in such a large country as China, there are probably not a few County Magistrates Yu at present.</p>
<h3>Witticisms</h3>
<p>— Ti Gong</p>
<p>The red-turbaned Sikh watchman of the alley was arrested by the police for stealing from Mr. Zhang's residence and taken to court. Unexpectedly, Mrs. Zhang suddenly went to court and requested to bail the Sikh. The long-term consultant lawyer of Mr. Zhang's residence quickly called Mr. Zhang to ask what this meant. Mr. Zhang stammered for a long time and said, "This is probably my concubine's humanitarianism."</p>
<p>The owner of a department store invited Mr. Wang to dinner. Mr. Wang said, "Your company's great sacrifice these days has collapsed the copper railing. Isn't that deliberately taking a loss?" The owner smiled and said softly, "Among ourselves, it doesn't matter. We wouldn't really lose money. We'll just earn a little less." Mr. Wang went home, and his wife happily told him, "I cut six cheongsams at Company X today. The fabric only cost two dollars a foot. It was really cheap." Mr. Wang stroked his small mustache and said, "You are cheap, and she is cheap. It seems that the one who suffers is me."</p>
<h3>The Lion Roars</h3>
<p>— Fu Lei</p>
<p>Liu Shi's painting exhibition has already opened and closed. This is a gratifying thing. Because, in this time of war, chaos, and national crisis, the artist has not abandoned his cultural front and is working harder with extra caution.</p>
<p>Liu Shi is an extremely clever and quick-witted young man. I often advise him to be clever but not quick-witted in life, and to be an artist, he must especially have a bit of foolishness, which is of course far from quick-wittedness. Liu Shi is most easily influenced by others, because he is quick-witted. An unsuccessful work is of course inevitably influenced by others, but there is a difference between influence and imitation, and the result of quick-wittedness will often bury one's own personality and confuse influence with imitation. Liu Shi seems to have understood this point. His efforts over the past year have been to extricate himself from his hesitant, divergent, and depressed state, and to search for his own path with unwavering conviction. He is slowly abandoning likeness, ingenuity, and flamboyance, those superficial and dazzling techniques, and is experimenting with unity, purity, synthesis, and composure. In landscapes such as "Snow Trench," "Sound of Horns," "Eight Character Bridge," "Autumn Morning," and "Landscape No. 70," and in recent works from Putuo such as "South Heavenly Gate," there is this trend. The light and lively small techniques have disappeared in these works, and there is another kind of majestic brushwork. The bright and eye-catching colors he used to use have also transformed into deep, restrained, and melancholic melodies. Here, I am not saying that the use of color cannot be bright, but bright colors must not be vulgar, and must have a foundation. If bright brushstrokes can be refined from a deep and poignant poetic mood, then their brightness will no longer be superficial beauty but an expression of inner peace and happiness. The work "Sunset Glow" is a good example.</p>
<p>The three portraits of Miss Liang, Ms. Wen Zhen, and Miss Zhu are not only completely different from the twisted, fragmented faces of "Mother of a Friend" and "Miss Wenchen," but also attempt bold omissions, psychological peeks, and the modern interest in decorative style.</p>
<p>"Three Monk Stones" and "Portrait Sketch" (two works), and "Putuo Sea Bath" (two works) are the most outstanding and noteworthy works in Liu Shi's exhibition. "Three Monk Stones" is purely Eastern art produced by Western tools. This is a brand new and infinitely promising path. "Portrait Sketch" is rich in the charm of pastel painting, without the feeling of delicacy and astringency. It is a new discovery. "Putuo Sea Bath" is closest to the decorative interest of Dufy, but it cannot be compared with Dufy's innocence and detached mood. The boldness of the layout of "Snow Trench" is a significant success in Liu Shi's technique.</p>
<p>The current dark and chaotic era and country are the best opportunities to cultivate artists. Lion, you must remember this and not let it down!</p>
<h3>Silver Threads (13)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>(Seven)</p>
<p>"Is the madwoman upstairs surnamed Yuan?" Regiment Commander Yuan was in doubt, or perhaps motivated by curiosity, so he pointed upstairs and asked Fenruo.</p>
<p>"Yes, she's just a poor seamstress; it's a pity she doesn't have any family: the two of us rely on each other for life." Fenruo sighed and went to make tea, without speaking to Regiment Commander Yuan face to face.</p>
<p>"Since she shares my surname and is your good friend, allow me to go and visit her."</p>
<p>"No… don't go upstairs, she can't see strangers, please forgive me! Have a cup of cold tea and you should go to the meeting place." Fenruo handed Regiment Commander Yuan a cup of tea.</p>
<p>"Why don't you send her to a mental asylum?"</p>
<p>"Those with money are treated better in mental asylums; the poor who go in are simply entering prison. Apart from suffering indefinite imprisonment and dying inside, she will never see the light of day. Fortunately, there are times when her mind is clear, and she is just like an ordinary healthy person; when she is sick, I take care of her. We are all suffering people, helping each other is a good thing."</p>
<p>"How did she become mentally ill? Perhaps she suffered some stimulation?"</p>
<p>"I don't know the details. It seems she is a woman who was abandoned by her husband, because she has never talked about it; when I ask her, she doesn't want to say."</p>
<p>"This person is too pitiful; but are you willing to spend your whole life with a madwoman? Time passes so quickly, and there are so many changes in life. You should take care of yourself! It is best if you move to the city to live, and if you don't want to leave the madwoman, then move together, I should do my best to help you. Once you are in the city, you can also hire a good doctor to diagnose and treat her."</p>
<p>"We still want to solve our own lives. We have been used to living a hard life for the past few years. Going to the city would be inconvenient. But, I really want to hear you talk about your happy history since we separated. Please tell me simply, five minutes is enough."</p>
<p>"Fen! I'll just tell you one simple sentence, and you can imagine my situation in the past few years."</p>
<p>"What exactly is it? You must have added several children, as handsome and lovable as you."</p>
<p>"Alas, my Fen! I am still a widower to this day, where would I get children?"</p>
<p>"Then where is your wife?"</p>
<p>"Ever since I left 丨 Escaped from my home, my hometown, and joined the army, I have never communicated with anyone from my hometown. I don't know where my wife is. The young widow may have married a very good husband, and I hope that is what she did, as I expected; otherwise she must have died."</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Rush Soars</h3>
<p>Swap Near… Amount Dried Up</p>
<p>The gold market rose sharply by fourteen taels and two. Yesterday, the gold price had a strong surge, with more than seven taels in total pullback. Finally, it surged by fourteen taels to nothing. The reason for the sudden increase was actually the impending swap, the amount of gold dried up, and even more so because the spot goods were particularly scarce. Fearing that the bulls would raise the premium, the shorts rushed to cover. However, the silver market fell again, and the exchange rate also fell back. American cotton, etc., have all reported small falls. Therefore, when the gold price opened high, it had already broken through the 720 tael mark. Afterwards, the foreign exchange was unusually tight, and it continued to advance. Again, because American banks were still willing to sell, and there seemed to be more sellers in the market, it once returned to 720 taels. At noon, it showed a sharp image again, because demand was frequent, and the market felt particularly strong. The exchange rate became even tighter, and large households competed to buy strongly. The market situation had a great chance of success, and it was said that it was easy to enter and difficult to withdraw. Afterwards, it was calculated to be between 727 taels. The industry's intentions were extremely high, and it was expected that this swap would be above five or six taels. Now, the details of the market situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opened up eight taels and three from the early morning of October, the opening price was 720 taels and five qian, an increase of eight taels and three. This is because large bars and American silver fell by one-eighth, futures silver also fell by two and a half li, and private telegrams went down by sixteen-thirds of a point. Exchange rate fell by seventy-five to one point. (However, it was heard that before the opening, 17 taels had been done outside the market, sold by Xiangfeng to Hongkangyong. Then the buyer became active, and it was added to more than 20 taels.) Hengyu, Fuyu, Zhaofengchang and others took the lead and entered. The price retreated to 20 taels and two qian. This was just a listing and nothing more. Before long, Zhifeng, Hengxing, Yuanyifeng, Yonghengyu, Yongfeng, Zhaofengchang, Qianchangxiang, Hengchangyong, Yongchunyuan and others all bought positions, so the price gradually rose by three taels to zero. However, at that time there was a one tael zero hover. Dadecheng and Yuanxingyong sold out. Until the American dollar first settled at thirty-one yuan and six two five, November one two five, then did thirty-one yuan, to nine fifteen was twenty-three taels and a half.

After this suddenly turned down, because Yuanmaoyong Zhifengyong Yifengyong Qiangchangxiang Futai Henghengyu Yuantai etc. dumping, but also the old Citibank came out November the American dollar one two five, HSBC out of December three one two five, the line purge three taels of more, but the panhead is very small, until eleven zero died as nineteen taels and eight qian, however immediately turned up, McCalli suck October English gold one nine four three seven five, Sassoon came into December five six two five, Hengxing Shangyang bought into, bingxing Hongkangyonghengxingyuan etc. also come to buy, until the afternoon closed as twenty-two taels and nine qian, Yongfeng Hengyixie Xingyong continued, so the price lifted up to more than twenty taels.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Plummets</h3>
<p>According to a report from the New Harmony Foreign Firm, the New York stock market suffered a major blow on Monday (the 12th), a phenomenon unprecedented in the market in the past month. The market already showed weakness at the opening, and selling pressure increased, leading to a disparity between supply and demand, and prices plummeted. Although there was a slight recovery later, the results showed that each stock still fell by 3 to 4 yuan compared to the previous day. At the same time, because various railway stocks announced plans to reissue debt to repay debts due in mid-October, bonds also plummeted. Trading throughout the day was quite active, with a total trading volume of 4 million shares. The reason for the stock market crash was attributed to the lack of improvement in business and the continued pessimism about cotton and wheat. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn Market Declines Rapidly</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is extremely weak, and the decline is intensifying. The sudden drop in American cotton has made people even more apprehensive. Sellers are becoming more active, and the market is falling sharply. As for actual demand from buyers, they are hesitant due to the poor environment, and transactions are even more sluggish. Currently, there are many short sellers, and the market sentiment is very weak, but the Rongxing Company has not taken any action.</p>
<p>People's Standard Yarn Plummets by Over Two Taels: The opening of the People's Standard Yarn market was sluggish due to the further decline in American cotton, and the downward trend was sharp. Except for the near two-month contracts, the far-month contracts all broke the 50-tael mark, falling by 1 tael, 578 qian to 2 taels. The afternoon opening was flat, and the second and third rounds of trading fell by another 2 to 4 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 27,900 bales. Sales included 830 bales of Yuda, 900 bales of Yukang, 900 bales of Dafeng, 800 bales of Tongxing, and 650 bales of Tonghe.

<h3>Standard Cotton Finds New Low Price</h3>
<p>The cotton market is experiencing a sudden decline, and the situation is deteriorating. The spot price of American cotton has fallen into the 8-fen range, causing great shock. The market is falling, and each month has found a new low price. Only October is still holding a little, but the major bulls have no intention of selling. However, the selling momentum of general retail investors is strong.</p>
<p>Far-Month Standard Cotton Plummets by 6 and a Half Qian: The opening of the Zheng Standard Cotton market was even more sluggish due to the further decline in American cotton. Each month fell by 5 to 6 qian. In the afternoon, there was a slight rebound of 5 fen. The total trading volume for the day was 102,700 dan. Sales included 3,500 dan of Yuda, 2,600 dan of Tianlong, 3,500 dan of Senkang, 3,600 dan of Renfeng, and 3,600 dan of Yu Chang. Purchases included 6,500 dan of Gengfeng, 8,700 dan of Changfeng, 2,500 dan of Rongxing, 4,300 dan of Xincheng, 2,100 dan of Dachang, 2,000 dan of Shenchang, and 2,200 dan of Yu Chang.

<h3>American and British Cotton Revert to Downstream</h3>
<p>Eight Fen Enters Idle</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton's initial Liverpool news was unfavorable and weak. Later, due to commercial hedging sales and long positions being closed out, the market was even softer. Futures fell by 42 to 43 points, and spot goods fell by 35 points. British cotton futures fell by 14 to 15, and spot goods rose by 2 points. Spot cotton rose by 20 points. Indian cotton market closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegraph on the 12th).</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice, River Below Rice Market Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the rice market south of Shanghai, a total of sixteen or seventeen rice boats arrived from various groups. Transactions on this street were not active. Scattered loads of Changshu, Xichang, Beigeng, and Su Tong groups were opened, each around 100 shi (bushels), with the opening price lowered by a jiao. Appetite for Dongxin and early and late rice was scarce, indicating a downstream trend. New Yangjian and Jiang Baijian were sold as soon as they arrived, and the market was stable.</p>
<p>New Zha Rice Conditions: Not many goods arrived from the interior, about ten boats, and river storage was not sufficient. Retail sales in urban and rural stores were increasingly sluggish as the Mid-Autumn Festival approached. The prices of thick geng and lidao were each nearly a jiao lower. New geng, new du, and yangjian arrived and were sold, with no price increase or decrease. There was no appetite for new kejian, and the situation was declining.</p>
<h3>Saigon Rice Storage Low, Trend Turns Brisk</h3>
<p>Northern Groups Load Siamese Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation was firm and stable. Saigon rice inventory was gradually decreasing, and the appetite of this street and rural villages was very good. Yesterday, 1,500 bags were sold, and the market sentiment was tight by 2 to 3 fen. Yesterday, the northern groups inquired about Siamese rice and small jiaomi rice, and the market sentiment also changed. However, the inventory of small jiaomi rice was uniquely loaded, and sales were limited, and the market was still soft. The Unified Market opened with 1,000 bags of Siamese rice, priced at 8 yuan, 9 jiao, and 5 fen, and 500 bags of small jiaomi rice, priced at 8 yuan, 6 jiao to 8 yuan, 5 jiao and 5 fen. 1,500 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice, priced at 9 yuan, 2 jiao, and 2 fen to 9 yuan and 2 jiao. 105 bags of Jiangxi Jiyuan rice, priced at 13 yuan and 3 jiao, of which 1,000 bags of Siamese rice and 200 bags of small jiaomi rice were handled by the northern groups, all were handled by this street.</p>
<h3>Flour Bidding Sales Remarkably Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of various months uniformly showed a sharp decline. The quoted price of foreign wheat suddenly fell by about 5 to 6 jiao, causing the psychology of the general public to be greatly panicked. Moreover, the price of foreign wheat has been falling for days, and the arrival of spot goods in China is inevitable. Therefore, the selling pressure was very strong. The number of shipments from the Fufeng Factory was also very smooth. The other factories were still watching, but the general trend was gone, so it could not show a good momentum. By the afternoon opening, it was initially seen as flat, and then it was reported that Fufeng had finalized the purchase of foreign wheat, with a combined price of only 3 taels, 8 qian, and 2 fen. Therefore, it continued to ship batches. Many inland customers were willing because the price of rice was falling, and they did not dare to buy, so the subsequent trend was still seen as flat and weak. As a result, this month fell by 1 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous day, October fell by 2 fen and 2.5 li, November rose by 2 fen and 7 li, December and January fell by 3.5 fen, and February fell by 3 fen and 7.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Plummets by Six or Seven Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of wheat futures in the morning and afternoon, the prices of various months uniformly showed a sharp decline. The quoted price of foreign wheat continued to fall by 5 to 6 jiao. The quoted price of foreign wheat has been falling for several days. People were initially resistant, but yesterday's decline was very sharp, so most buyers have given up and dare not enter again. Short sellers then continued to ship batches, so trading progressed smoothly, and the market became increasingly sluggish. Judging from the recent situation, if there is indeed a spot transaction of foreign wheat, the future of domestic wheat will be severely impacted if it is held onto too tightly. As a result, September and October fell by 5 fen compared to the previous day, November fell by 6 fen, December fell by 7 fen, January did not move, and February fell by 7 fen.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>(Report from New Harmony Foreign Firm) On Monday (the 12th), Chicago wheat fell by 1.875 pounds due to sales from the East and the weakness of the New York stock market. September futures for old crop did not open. The trading volume on the 12th was 20 million bushels. The market prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price; Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>September (New Crop); 50.5</p>
<p>December; 54.375; Down 1.875</p>
<p>May; 59.625; Down 1.875</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Coarse and White Sugar Trend Tightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise in the gold standard, the Dutch exchange rate was shrinking, and the Liu Dish of the Guild Hall was still tightly controlled. Grade 24 coarse white sugar ordinary goods were priced at 14 taels, 4 qian, and 7.5 fen, an increase of 2.5 fen compared to the previous day, and there were very few shipments. The market is still expected to be good, and the sentiment is excellent. However, due to the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, sales are inevitably inferior. If the exchange rate does not change after the festival, the market price is expected to continue to rise. The market inventory of the factory's ice flower green No. 3 goods is inherently scarce. Yesterday, Dalai Company opened with 80 bags of Zhenxing goods priced at 10 taels and a half. Not too many openings, and the trend is tending to be tight.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods, Fungus Weakness Extremely Rebounds</h3>
<p>The price of fungus in the previous market, such as that of Sichuan goods from the upper villages, once dropped to within 60 taels, but when things reach an extreme, they must return. Therefore, it has been gradually tightening recently. Sichuan fungus has opened from 64 taels to 63 and a half taels, Yichang fungus from 61 and 2 taels to 58 and 9 taels, and the second-best are 2 to 3 taels higher or lower. Hanxun mixed fungus is 51 taels, and Malanping goods are 52 taels and 8 qian. It is difficult to make a profit. This area's sales are mostly from the Wen-Tai group, followed by the Min group. The Yue group has direct purchases, so there are not many transactions. The current prevailing market price for second-grade fungus is 95 taels, and mixed fungus is 61 and 2 taels to 56 taels, and the trend is stable.</p>
<h3>Fresh Dried Longan Market Price Reverses and Falls</h3>
<p>Since the new fresh dried longan came out, the goods have not arrived in large quantities. This batch of Taiyuan rounds arrived in Shanghai, totaling more than 70 boxes. Although the number is not large, most of them are wet and soft, so the movement is sluggish, and the market trend has turned weak. Yesterday, the firm has already opened more than 50 boxes, and the price has fallen by about 3 taels compared to before.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea, Overseas White Raw Silk Continuing to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American firms Ganli, Lanlebi, etc., all received accounts from New York for September, October, and November for medium-grade white raw silk, and the price continued to fall by 10 to 15 taels. The manufacturers, in view of the high price of autumn cocoons and the importance of silk capital, insisted on not selling. Therefore, yesterday, only Baoke entered 5 bales of Shuangtong brand 13 to 15 denier spot white raw silk, priced at 650 taels, and Samsung, etc., entered 25 bales of Mianzhou yellow coarse silk, priced at 405 taels.</p>
<h3>Dried Cocoon Price Expected to Fall</h3>
<p>Autumn Cocoons on the Market, Silk Sales Sluggish... Cocoon Capital Expected to Be 30 to 40 Taels Lower: Recently, due to the low-priced dumping of Japanese silk in the foreign silk market, overseas silk prices have fallen sharply, and silk sales in Europe and England have become sluggish. Therefore, the selling price of cocoons in Shanghai is expected to fall. In addition, new autumn cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang are gradually being listed, the yield of cocoons is increasing, and the cocoon quality is also excellent. The manufacturers' appetite for raw materials is waning, and the cocoon capital is expected to be 30 to 40 taels lower per dan of silk. Yesterday, Shanghai North's Xieji and other silk factories negotiated more than 500 dan of Changshu spring dried cocoons, but the deal did not go through due to disagreements on the price.</p>
<p>Needle and Eyebrow Green Tea Sales Active in France</p>
<p>Yesterday, the needle and eyebrow green tea of Luzhuang Tuzhuang Erlu and the firms of Yingzhuang Yihe Xiehe, etc., received requests from Morocco and because the exchange rate was loose, the intent to import turned strong, and the selling market was also slightly firmer. The heart-stirring goods of Luzhuang Zhenmei green tea were slightly lively, and ordinary goods were still stagnant. As for Gongxi green tea, yesterday the Baidouzhuang Yuruichang and other firms had a slight appetite, but the Russian Xieqi Association was still determined not to purchase unless it was cheap, and the market could not develop.</p>
<p>Thin White Iron, All Down</p>
<p>Recently, both British and American thin white iron have been falling in price. It is speculated that most of the reasons are that the supply is wider than the demand, and the situation is intermittent. Each group is temporarily suspended, so the market is exceptionally light. However, recently, foreign firms have been selling off spot goods, so people are terrified, and the standard is becoming more and more dire. At this moment, 37-inch Red Bird brand British white iron is selling for only 9 qian and 4 fen per sheet, Red Foreign Character is 9 qian and 2 fen, and miscellaneous brands are 9 qian. It is heard that foreign firms are opening up a large number, only 8 qian and 7.8 fen. 36-inch Red Bird brand British white iron is estimated at 8 qian, and miscellaneous second-grade is 7 qian and 6 fen. 48 sheets of American white iron are estimated at 15 taels per dan, which is 3 to 4 fen lower than the previous British white iron, and American white iron has dropped by 5 qian. However, people's hearts are very soft, and the market is still expected to decrease further.</p>
<p>Coal, Datong Lump Coal, One Weak, One Stable</p>
<p>Datong lump coal is divided into two types, one is picked and selected, and the other is screened lumps. In recent days, the sales of picked lumps have not been many, and the price has been slightly weaker, while the screened lumps have a better path, with 100 to 200 tons of transactions per day, so the price is very stable. Yesterday, the market price of picked lump coal was 13 taels, 2 qian, and 5 fen per ton, and the price of screened lump coal was 12 taels and 5 qian.</p>

<h3>The Awkward Literati</h3>
<p>— Cang Ping</p>
<p>Cannot lift with their shoulders, cannot carry with their hands, and cannot make a living by selling and buying! This is the general reason for the awkwardness of literati.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, while some literati have been majestic and prominent, others have been destitute their whole lives. Flipping through ancient and modern novels, how many literati have truly distinguished themselves? And how many literati have died in obscurity, perishing their whole lives? I can say with certainty: of a thousand literati, one who can distinguish themselves is already an overestimate.</p>
<p>Alas! Literati have such a poor path, yet students today all admire literati. With great difficulty, they spend ten years by the window, only to find that in this vast world, there is not a single place where they can earn a meal. They retire at home, sighing to the roof, and only then do they lament! Unable to lift with their shoulders, unable to carry with their hands, they are not as good as a small vendor, who has strength and eats what they earn, and is free and unrestrained.</p>
<p>To be a literati of influence, of course, means "a pen sweeps through thousands of troops" and "a word is worth a thousand gold," but for destitute literati, no matter how brilliant your writing is, it cannot feed you when you are hungry or clothe you when you are cold. At best, you can file a lawsuit for someone, set up a fortune-telling stall, or write letters for others.</p>
<p>I am also a literati, because I have already tasted the flavors of a literati, so I shamelessly write this article (Awkward Literati) to inform future literati? I hope they will no longer bury themselves in dead books, no longer be refined and gentle literati, but quickly turn back, seek some practical skills, and compete for survival in this fiercely competitive world, and no longer be lifeless literati.</p>

<h3>Passing North Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>— Ze Li</p>
<p>Horse tracks and the sound of cars stir up dust on my face, the flowers on the roadside are from the old spring. Tall buildings and mansions remain, with the slanting sun shining on people.</p>
<p>The mountains and rivers of the homeland have endured thousands of劫, the beacon fires and wars have turned to dust. Prosperity is ultimately fought for by people, but this place still presents a hundred shows.</p>
<p>Smoke and dust still resemble the colors of a battlefield, I revisit the old place after the calamity. Among the broken walls and ruins in the setting sun, it is difficult to ask passersby about the past.</p>

<h3>Talking About a Piece of Four-Dimensional Space</h3>
<p>— Ding Chengwei</p>
<p>Originally, this four-dimensional space was a problem discussed in the theory of relativity. The principle of relativity is a very difficult thing to obtain, and it is by no means something that beginners in science can understand, but since I saw this problem, I felt that my interest in this problem was very strong. At the same time, I feel that there are many examples in our daily life that can be used to explain and illustrate four-dimensional space. Now I will give a few examples that are commonly seen in daily life and explain them with the simplest principles.</p>
<p>Before discussing this issue, we should first clarify the definition of space. In the past, this definition was simply that it could contain objects. However, since Einstein took the stage, he broadened the definition of space. He believes that space not only contains length, width, and height, but also time is an element of space.</p>
<p>In the past, Newton regarded space and time as two absolutely independent things, but after Einstein's theory of relativity was published, he included time in space and connected it with height to form four-dimensional space.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>What is the fourth dimension? Simply put, it's time.</p>
<p>Everything in one-dimensional space has only position and length, such as points and lines in geometry. They can exist in one-dimensional space.</p>
<p>Everything in two-dimensional space has length and width, but no height.</p>
<p>Everything in three-dimensional space has length, width, and height, with both position and volume.</p>
<p>Everything in four-dimensional space contains time in addition to length, width, and height.</p>
<p>If we use the coordinate method to express it, one-dimensional space has only one straight line as the axis (X-axis), but its two ends can be extended indefinitely. Two-dimensional space can be expressed by two straight lines (that is, the X and Y axes) perpendicular to each other on a plane. Three-dimensional space is represented by three straight lines (Y and Z axes) perpendicular to each other in space. Then, of course, four-dimensional space should also be represented by four straight lines (X, Y, Z, and T axes) perpendicular to each other in space. But in fact, space cannot have four lines perpendicular to each other at the same time, so here we can only assume that in addition to the three straight lines perpendicular to each other in four-dimensional space, there is also a dotted line that can be perpendicular to these three lines.</p>
<p>At the same time, Einstein also gave an example that is easy to encounter in daily life to explain the reason why time should be included in space.</p>
<p>Suppose a person is going to attend a banquet, then you must first know his address, in other words, you must first know the location of his banquet, which county, which street, which door number, which floor, which number, and at the same time we must know what time it is held.</p>
<p>In this sentence, which county, which street, which door number only tell you the position in two-dimensional space, which floor tells you the position in the third dimension space, and which time tells you the position in the fourth dimension space (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Remarrying and Remarriage</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>This is the most unequal issue between men and women. When a man's wife dies, he can remarry, but when a woman's husband dies, she cannot. As for men having three wives and four concubines, that is explicitly prohibited by law as a crime. It should be understood that the union of men and women should not be based solely on the premise of having offspring. Young men and women at a certain stage have the need to choose a partner of the opposite sex, which is a natural physiological tendency. Nowadays, with the trend of Westernization, marriage is determined by the individuals themselves, resulting in a false sense of freedom and rampant promiscuity, which is certainly not a good phenomenon. However, in the past, young women were not allowed to step out of their boudoirs, and yet books are filled with stories of illicit affairs. This shows that crimes committed by men and women are driven by physiological factors. However, I am not advocating for crime.</p>
<p>What I advocate is a monogamous system. When a man's wife dies, there is no question about him remarrying, as it is the custom. When a woman's husband dies, she should also be allowed to remarry if she wishes. However, if the couple had an exceptionally loving relationship during their lifetime, those who voluntarily wish to remain chaste should be respected, just as men who voluntarily choose to remain widowers are. But if one acts out of temporary impulse and later secretly commits immoral acts, they should be able to declare their intention to remarry beforehand, which would also protect the reputation of the husband's family. Because physiological needs are not something to be ashamed of, secretly seeking them out is considered despicable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for economic reasons, if a woman cannot support herself after her husband dies and chooses to remarry, this should not be condemned. Although there is a growing call for women to have careers, how many can truly be independent? Who says that a woman should starve to death after her husband dies?</p>
<p>In my opinion, remarrying and remarriage are both perfectly legitimate. There is no need to pretend to remain unmarried and commit immoral acts in secret. As the saying goes, "That which cannot be spoken of should not be done." Things that can be openly discussed should not be done in secret due to social customs.</p>
<p>This is a very important issue that has not yet been raised by members of the social reform discussion group in this publication. I am unlearned and unskilled, and I am merely providing a starting point for this significant issue. I hope that fellow members of the group will contribute articles for discussion, offering insights and ideas, so that I will not have failed the author's original intention.</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3>The Third Secret Plan</h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>Old Master Kong had just taken a charming and beautiful concubine, preparing to enjoy the delights of the bedroom. However, he kept thinking about how he had often heard that when someone takes a concubine, they inevitably become overly fond of her, listening to her every word and following her every plan, fearing that she might be hurt by a breeze or startled by a raindrop, leading to discord in the family and disharmony among relatives. This fulfills the saying, "If you want a family to be unhappy, take a concubine." Now, he was determined to stick to his principles and not indulge her excessively, lest she develop a spoiled and disrespectful attitude. He should make his own decisions independently and firmly reject any slanderous words she might offer, so as to avoid repeating the mistakes that lead to "family unhappiness"!</p>
<p>A month after the concubine entered the household, she observed that her husband's attitude towards her—affection—lacked depth. He was unwilling to accept her whispered suggestions, and she saw no sign of him transferring control of household affairs to her. She thought that if her husband remained so clear-headed and unwilling to listen to women's advice, it would be difficult for her to achieve her desires. Even her little sisters would laugh at her, calling her an incompetent fool who couldn't control her husband!</p>
<p>So, she decided to use a small matter to test him, to see if he would accept her words at all. However, the result was that the speaker spoke earnestly, but the listener disregarded them, showing no sign of acceptance.</p>
<p>She secretly plotted, "He is so determined to stick to his own ideas, huh? Bah! I'm not afraid. I have a way to manipulate you, to make you kneel at my plump legs and recognize me as your chief strategist, obeying my every command!"</p>
<p>That day, she put her plan into action. Seeing him enter the room, she demanded that he immediately build a separate luxurious house and separate from his first wife. However, after hearing her words, he remained noncommittal, showing no sign of agreement. So, she began to weep bitterly, crying and making coercive demands. However, his heart was as hard as iron, and no matter how much she cried and wailed, he refused to grant her request. Seeing that her first plan had failed, she proceeded with her second clever scheme, saying to him, "If you don't agree to my demands, I'll die right here and now!" Saying this, she ran to the bed, grabbed a belt, and put it around her neck, pretending to hang herself. But when he saw this, he</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>didn't even glance at her. Instead, he ran outside! She thought that his old ideas were truly firm, and this clever trick of intimidation was not working. In that case, she had to use her third secret weapon to achieve final victory. So, she quickly threw aside the belt and hurriedly chased after him, embracing him tightly. With a face full of smiles, she rubbed her rosy cheeks against his beard and said coquettishly, "Don't you want me anymore? I can't bear to die without you!" At the same time, her two snowy white and slender hands kept caressing his body, up and down. Ah, clever plan! With this move, he immediately said, "My darling! Okay, okay, don't say that! I can't bear to lose you either. We'll move tomorrow..." Sentimentality for love triumphs over heroic spirit. His firm will was softened by her mesmerizing tactics. The next day, they indeed moved out. From then on, he could not help but listen to her every word and follow her every plan, fulfilling the policy of "family unhappiness."</p>
<p>Sin</p>
<h3>What Will Be the Outcome?</h3>
<p>— Ang Ying</p>
<p>Yesterday, I ran into Mr. Yang, and the first thing I asked him was, "Is your new wife good? Are you satisfied?" My question immediately made Mr. Yang's haggard face look even gloomier. I thought something must be wrong! I heard him say melancholically:</p>
<p>"Don't mention it! The new wife… I hate that demon!"</p>
<p>"So, you don't like her…? You're not married, are you?"</p>
<p>This question made his face even paler, and he said, "We… we're already married!"</p>
<p>"What? You said you don't like her, so why did you marry her?"</p>
<p>"This…" He seemed to have something difficult to say, but finally continued, "Old friend! You know, as soon as I stepped into my home, I planned to propose dissolving the engagement to my family. But when I raised this issue, my father roared like thunder, my mother wept and sobbed, scolding me for not being successful in my studies and becoming more confused the more I studied. They even opposed me objecting to the daughter-in-law chosen by my parents! Moreover, this engagement was made when we were children, and both families have good reputations. The next day, her father also found out and came to my house, saying that if I wanted to dissolve the engagement, he would sue my father! My father gave me an ultimatum, saying that if I didn't marry the Li family's daughter, he would tell me to get lost and never receive any financial support from the family… These were all cold arrows piercing my heart. Fearing that leaving my family and school would leave me without food (you know, can a college student find a job?), I succumbed…"</p>
<p>I took a breath and said, "So, you want to spend your life with her?"</p>
<p>"No! After I graduate from university and have a stable job, I'll divorce her!"</p>
<p>"As long as you haven't had any physical relations with her!" I said quickly. Mr. Yang's face changed, showing a painful spasm, and he stammered, "It's already happened! Ah!" When I heard this, I felt like a bucket of cold water had been poured on me, and I said to him bluntly:</p>
<p>"Old Yang! This is wrong! You say you don't love her and hope to divorce her one day; yet, you have physical relations with her! How contradictory! Those feudalistic people can use this point to attack you! How will you face the consequences?"</p>
<p>His face was pale, "But who will believe that we sleep in the same bed…"</p>
<p>"This can be verified by a doctor!" I said.</p>
<p>"So, what should I do now?" The veins on his forehead were bulging.</p>
<p>"What should you do? Old Yang! Don't believe that you'll have a job after graduation. Many graduates are running into walls. This marriage is entirely due to your own weak will, complacency, illusion, impulsiveness… How will you face the consequences in the future?"</p>
<p>Mr. Yang stared blankly at the ground. "The consequences?" he said in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>Wearing a luxurious Western suit, with your hair neatly combed and chest puffed out, visiting stores or meeting friends at some large organization, the attendants there will treat you with special courtesy, taking advantage of you. Wearing a tattered long gown, you can stroll slowly by the roadside, and the beggars won't reach out to you: "Sir, please give me a copper coin"—this is also taking advantage of you.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>In the past, if you paid close attention, whenever a VIP fell ill, there would be a change in the political situation, which was consistently accurate. Ah, how many secret schemes and how many sins are involved in this!</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>A friend who recently returned from abroad said, "China is a country where you can urinate anywhere." Thinking about this carefully, it is truly heartbreaking!</p>

<p>When you are sick in bed, you will realize the happiness of being healthy, so "health" is the only happiness in life.</p>

<p>The dismissal and arrest, or removal from office, of Chinese military personnel are merely momentary tricks. After a while, they make a comeback, like a tumbler toy.</p>
