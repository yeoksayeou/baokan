<h3 id="c1">世界經濟會議之展望　仁 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>七月九日洛桑會議協定告成以後。世界經濟界一時陡呈活潑之象。各國股市猛騰。商品價格狂漲。一若一九二九年以來之世界恐慌。將爲洛桑協定之簽定而克服詎料時過境遷。此曇花一現之假景氣。終不可恃。於是向之熱望於洛桑會議者。遂不得不轉移其目光。以希望於未來之世界經濟會議矣。</p>
<p>夫世界經濟會議之召集。本爲洛桑協定决議第五條中所預約者。該决議中規定之議題爲（一）財政問題。（通貨及信用政策外國匯兌物價資本移動）（二）經濟問題。（生產及通商狀態之改善如關稅政策輸出入之禁止制限及分配）據三日日内瓦電。國聯理事會組織委員會。以求世界經濟復興與實施賠償戰僨之洛桑協定計。决定召集世界經濟會議於倫敦。並爲籌備會議起見。决於本月末日先召集專門家會議於日内瓦。至經濟會議之正式會議當俟來月專門家會議完了以後。再經各國政府研究始能召集。估計當在來年二月左右矣。再據外電所傳。籌備委員會以英相西門爲委員長。由美法日德意比及挪威等八國代表所搆成。</p>
<p>目前世界最大之經濟問題。當爲戰債問題關稅問題通貨問題三者。唯美國在承諾出席於籌備會議時。以不討論戰債問題及加入銀問題之討論爲條件。據美國之意見。以爲戰債問題係美國與歐洲各國之貨借關係。而非今日世界之一般問題。故未來世界經濟會議之中心問題當爲通貨與關稅二者而已。</p>
<p>此通貨與關稅二問題。實有一不可分離之關係。而此二問題。是否可於此世界經濟會議中解决之。實屬莫大之疑問。即以關稅問題。論此問題實爲今日世界各國利害衝突之最甚者。夫今日世界關稅戰激化之出發點。當推美國之保護關稅。而向抱自由貿易主義之英國。自世界恐慌發生以後。亦已捲入於關稅戰之旋渦中。金本位停止後之緊急關稅。今春之一般關稅。最近之特惠關稅。殆皆已明白的抛棄其自由貿易主義。而轉入爲關稅爭覇戰之一員。此次世界經濟會議中。實際上站於主體之地位者。厥唯英美兩國。而此兩國是否能於會議中。首先有退步之勇氣。殆爲一絕大之疑問。此外再就通貨問題而言。其最終目的。不過欲藉以提高物價而已。據國聯金委員會之意見。以爲救濟世界恐慌。首須提高物價。其策略一爲勸獎各主要金本位國實行協調。使以金計算之批發物價。回復於一九二八年之平準。二爲勸獎紙幣本位國。亦同樣以英磅爲響導。提高其物價而使安定之。然實際此二策略縱能達到目的。是否即可以恢復世界景氣。亦尙難料。而世界經濟會議之結果。是否得達以上二策略之目的。更屬一莫大之疑問矣。</p>
<p>四年來之世界經濟恐慌。逮乎今日。其程度已愈陷愈深。而世人之厚望於世界經濟會議者。無異於大旱之望雲霓。但吾人就會議之本身論。前途殊難樂觀。而美國之不欲討論戰債問題。實更與世界經濟會議以重大之打擊也。</p>

<p>哈瓦斯社十五日倫敦電　與愛爾蘭行政首領凡勒拉最親近之人物對哈瓦斯記者發表談話如下、「英愛談判之失敗、大部分由於英國閣員之態度、董渠等惟攻擊愛爾蘭陳述之理由而未提出何種具體之建議、渠等似並不望談判之有好結果、此吾人所大以爲奇者、但前途仍留有地步、自不待言目下關稅爭鬥又將開始、無論如何現行關稅定予維持」云</p>
<p>路透社十五日倫敦電　英愛會議流產、其最後一幕、爲原有公斷提議之復活、在直接談判以求解决之謀顯然失敗後、提交公斷之議乃復提出、但公斷會應否絕對由英帝國内產生之舊有爭執、依然爲解决之最後障　、聞自由邦代表以其適合情理之案件、始終爲英國所反對、良用悵悵、而英代表則拒絕南愛所提出地欵違法之說、聞凡勒拉且謂如將各種條約與恊定詳細研究、則將見英國在理論上欠愛爾蘭債欵共達二萬五千萬鎊云、</p>

<p>路透社十五日日内瓦電、德國對於國聯秘書處之改組、有所提議、商榷幾及十日、未有恊定但專辦此事小股委員會現已訂定折衷辦法、該委員會依允任何大國之人民、不能在秘書處佔兩個以上之重要位置、並規定以法人爲秘書長、意人與挪威人各一爲副秘書長、又英人德人日人各一爲次等秘書、此項辦法將於星期一日提交國聯大會</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十五日日内瓦電　國聯會第四委員會、經一星期之辛苦討論、始由全體投票將國聯秘書廳高級人員規章予以通過、此後秘書廳置秘書長一人、以副秘書長二人及帮辦秘書三人輔助之、副秘書長二人中、應有一人屬於行政院之非永久會員國、秘書長任期十年、副秘書八年、帮辦秘書七年國聯會任何會員國在秘書廳同時不得有高級人員兩人、此項規則應於最短期内使其實行、但以不妨害現行契約爲限、以目下形勢觀之、選任愛文諾爲秘書長、暫無問題惟至日後對其他高級職員、實行此項規則時、則不免發生困難、例如帮辦秘書期滿改任以及各股主任更換時、皆將成爲棘手問題云</p>
<p>路透社十五日日内瓦電　國聯預算案裁減三五一·五三一佛郎、係英國用其壓力所致、今晚此預算案已被通過、秘書長英人德魯蒙將於數月内辭職、今日聲稱、渠提議委任德人一人爲次等秘書長、管理國聯經濟與財政事務云、衆意此舉乃購取德國承認以法人愛文諾爲秘書長之代價、</p>

<p>不承認警察爲軍隊變相</p>
<p>國民社十六日日内瓦電　德代表羅森堡向新聞記者談話、痛駁法代表馬西格利稱德警察可視爲武裝軍隊之語、謂全德十四萬警察中三萬五千爲市警察、擔任管理街衢交通及瑣事、萬八千從事書記事務、其餘八萬七千人分隷十七邦、非由聯邦政府管理、且德警察無一猛烈武器如野砲之類、所有機關槍數額、亦由恊約國管理委員曾規定、即鐡甲車不過鋼板保護之汽車、遠非軍用鐡甲車可比若以此種警察謂其有軍事價値、母乃可笑、又謂警察有時偶作類似軍隊之操演者、僅係準備用以防亂起見、最後又謂總之以此事與數十萬軍隊及價値千百萬之軍備與軍實問題相較、直屬瑣屑而已</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十五日内瓦電　國聯大會德國首席代表羅曾伯、對國際報界發表談話、反駁昨日法代表馬西格利對德國警察之說明、羅氏主要辯駁點如下、（一）德國警察組織並不一律、亦無統一之指揮全國警察分屬於十七邦、而與聯邦政府無關、（二）德國警察之組織及武裝、係與大使會議及聯盟各國軍事監委員會幾經磋商而後規定者、其如此規定正在防範警察使不能利用於戰事也、（三）關於警察之規則並非秘密、由此規則可見警察訓練之目的、實得爲警察職務之用、（四）解除兵備區域、約當全國領土六分之一、在此區域内、警察爲維持秩序之唯一力量云云、吾人對此須加以說明、即昨日軍額委員會開會時、該會主席曾首先聲明謂委員會討論問題涉及此事、故法代表不能不加以陳述、且事關胡佛總統之提議其討論遲早、法國代表實亦無能左右也、</p>

<p>「社會一般對我的批評、有譽我的、有毁我的、譽我的那些事都是我應當做的、是我應盡的國民義務、决不敢自負至於毁我的、不外兩點、一種謂我矯枉過正、一種謂我長於倒戈、其實這兩種都是没有眞正知道我的錯處、我從來很少發表政治主張、一般人對我免不了有誤會要是以革命立塲來說、無論甚麽革命總免不了打倒壓迫多數人的統治階級、若祇知盲從統治者、便不能有所謂革命所以我過去的所行、是想推翻統治階級假使就封建式的統屬關係來說、在我們所認爲一切的革命行動、都是倒戈了譬如我在廊房討伐復辟、在北平推翻賄選政府以及遣溥儀出宮、與最近的幾次戰事、難道像這一類的反動先生們應當永久保留在台上嗎不過我屢次參加革命未嘗發表過我具體的政治主張、因爲我以前、認爲凡是違反民衆利益壓迫民衆的政府都應該打倒、至於打倒後應當怎麽辦、則等待國内賢豪來解决、我旣未存政權自攬的心、所以將不良政府推翻後、我便自動退職、請各派領袖去幹、如推翻賄選政府後的情形、即爲明證、我總想將惡人認淸了、抱定决心去剷除他惡人打倒後、好人便會來了誰想一此惡人去了二批惡人又來、不特使從事革命的人疲於奔命、就是無辜的民衆也跟着受多次的犧牲、這一點乃是我的錯誤、從前對革命無主張的錯誤、現在我覺悟了這種錯誤、所以我年來頗致力政治經濟社會各項問題及革命理論、以求對革命以後有政治上的辦法、至於攻擊我矯枉過正的人、我也有個解釋、我是窮小子出身、十七歲當兵、完全由行伍出來、所以身經若干的困難、深知社會中最下層民衆的隱痛、自然見着那班衣錦繡饜膏粱而不幹正事的先生們、深惡痛絕、自然看見社會中的種種不平、容易激發反抗的决心這就是我屢次參加革命的本因、我的吃苦耐勞、也從這裏出來的、我拿現在的生活與以前比較、雖然還是布衣蔬食、但我覺得個人的生活狀况、如此已夠了尤其是志在救世濟人的革命者、何必先求個人的享樂、因此、我想以我的生活作一標準、社會上許多許多不如我的窮苦同胞、須將他們的生活提高到能夠如我、至於窮奢極侈的先生們、我也希望能使他們的生活降低、在生產落後的中國更不應當妄費、若是全國人民都能過美國式的資本家生活、我自然不反對錦繡膏粱的享用了、所以用資本家眼光來看我或許我過這種簡單生活、是矯枉過正、不近乎他們的人情、假設肯平心靜氣的考量、全國的大人先生們、都過我這種生活、未必至於身體不健康、錦繡膏粱中的先生們恐怕其健康不如我的還不少、這是就個人方面說、若就社會來說、能大家如我的生活未始不可稍挽奢靡之風、未始不可少銷洋貨、况且儉以養廉、也可少出貪官汚吏、所以究竟我講儉約是矯枉過正呢、還是那講奢侈的是矯枉過正呢、這是我的過去的情形、至於現在我爲甚麽有了主張呢、自從前年戰事失敗隱居山林已經二年多了、這完全是靜心研究的機會、我常回想往事、追溯屢次失敗的原因、並努力讀一切社會科學的書籍、以助養我的思想、使我成爲有系統的、去求改造中國社會的道路、用書中的理論與過去的經騐、合諸現在社會實際狀况互相參證、於是我發生了兩種覺悟第一即是努力革命事業、必須有正確的主張第二、即是現在的各派學說、都互有短長尤其對於第一步實施的辦法、未能盡吻合於現在中國社會的需要、所以因症下藥、就轉到制度的改革了、在國難當前的關頭、帝國主義中最兇頑而公然以武力侵略不已的、自然是日本、而政府不特不抵抗、並且亡羊補牢的自衛計畫、都不能打算、請想任何國家的獨立完整决不能仰仗其他國家的輔翼、要倚賴他人纔能</p>
<p>立國、這便成了保護國這種常職、小學生也知這、所以在日本武力壓迫之下、只有講求目立圖存之道、决不是只向國聯哀號、就可以解决的、旣不能希望國聯代復國土、也不能希望國聯代維邊防、况且自己負責擔任國防的長官已取無抵抗政策、外人又何苦來代爲抵抗呢、所以我認爲無論外交情形如何、不可不努力備戰先作充實國防之準備、集中各軍事領袖及專門家共籌國防計劃、劃分國防區域所有全國各軍由中央選擇精銳、配置於各重要地點其老弱的與各地民衆結合、擔任後方交通、各地治安由警察民團義</p>
<p>勇軍等負責、統一兵工廠移殷腹地此爲備戰之急務、已往革命諸戰役爲革命而死的無撫恤、殘廢的無安置、受傷的無嘉獎有功的無存記、以致死亡殘廢的兵士其父母淪爲餓莩、妻室顚沛流離、子女出賣於人市、過去種種、事實俱在軍心民心失去、多由於此實有首先顧慮的必要各官兵雖遇外侮當前、不免有後顧的憂慮、現在欲激勵軍心、必先堅其信力、鼓其忠勇應爲陣亡者國建國祠鄉建鄉祠父母妻室子女應有撫恤、殘廢的應予優待並設工廠全其生活專設機關、指定專員辦理指定專欵限數月以内、辦有極大的成效、不效應懲罰辦事人員、此爲備戰中最重要事、其次、政府應拒絕攀援請託、眞正革命的有功人員應迅速查明起用、恢復黨的民主制、整飭黨的紀律、而後黨員精良、行動一致方能發生黨的効用、首都仍應遷至適當地點、以免帝國主義的威脅、恢復民衆運動、保障集會·結社·言論·出版自由恢復各種民衆組織、加以軍事訓練、厲行緊縮政策、裁併無用機關、實行財政公開以防濫費、嚴訂官吏凟職貪汚懲戒條例、以整吏治、擬定生產計劃、以合全國的必要消費原則、國營對外貿易、奢侈品應由國家專賣並加以購買的限制、嚴徵累進的所得稅與遺產稅、規定公務人員的最高薪及農工的最低薪、制定社會保險法、專設機關、實際施行、改正敎育計劃、培養國家需要的人材、並使人民有平等受敎育的機會凡此種種、均爲現在刻不容緩之事、前者汪精衛先生來電問我、我就是這樣主張、直至現在仍認爲立即實行以上諸端、然後再積極抗日、定有成效、月前在泰山曾發一電、中央如有决心抗日、我與百川同到南京坐獄、亦所甘心、不圖蹉跎至今、仍在不死不活的狀態中、現在國事日急、我不死人、人必死我、望國人戮力同心勉渡難關］（十月十二日）</p>

<p>東華隊東華陣綫佈開獨缺大將内衛李寗一名、於是馮蓮佑調内衛、屠開元任中樞楊人偉應召居屠之職、而關洵安吳幼良則仍任舊職、卽此小小更動、内部時有搖動之勢、惟獨風雨飄搖之中、吾人遂能訪得忠心赤胆之士、如馮運佑一身兼内外、鐡蹄所趨、敵人驚退吳幼良一日千里顯然有孫思敬作風大力闊斧、無往不利、屠關二氏、亦盡天職楊氏於前衛、似非素習、下半時則較有進境、萬象華心雄萬夫匹馬進攻、每有驚人之作惜彼時中部諸將、恒爲内部恐慌所牽掣不能一致對外、否則紀錄簿上必可添加多隻、李義臣之射擊輔以陳洪光之敏捷、陳家球之活潑錦上添花相得益彰惟以内部多故、不克盡其全力、陳虞添流日不佳、無甚貢獻、留待他次、將功贖罪、周賢言如何、上文已述、總之、東請得勝之第一大功臣也</p>

<p>上半時　大戰開場東華三箭連來陳洪光一頂、李義臣再頂、兩頂無效、加以李氏一脚又復斜出、臘克斯逞强阿提格首先叩關、不利而退嗣後雙方前鋒各施强烈之射擊、而中西兩位守門、乃提起精神、全力抵抗、誠是無暇可擊、嘆觀止焉東華首先失守咎不在守門者蓋其時守門者被冲人網網口已露、球遂自阿提格脚下一閃入門、觀者驚駭之餘但見左翼萬象華單槍匹馬、深入敵陣敵防紛紛潰退、一球傳中、李義臣平地掃出銀笛聲起、球入網中於是歡呼之聲、溢於四座、上半時結果、一對一和局、</p>
<p>下半時　萬象華首先作驚人之舉陳虞添攻門力弱、守門隨手拾得、萬氏第二次貢獻李義臣適當其衝、神脚擊去守者措手不及鐡門失陷、東華乃以二對一占先、此後雙方門前互有風浪卒以守者之得力、任何射擊、均難奏臘克斯困難猶鬬包圍東華、猛攻不已、何奈防守有方、志不得逞、結果東華仍以二對一得勝、</p>

<p>自由談	二一枝譚勇於抗日的張解元  瞻廬　　提起歷史上的抗日人物，誰也都是稱　着明代的戚繼光。捨着事實而取寓言，彎弓的后羿，揮戈的魯陽生，也是勇於抗日的有名人物：所以做到抗日文章，一定要說起后羿和魯陽生的故事。我說：勇於抗日的，還有一個赫赫有名的小張。道句話，一定引起人家的奇異；小張何嘗抗日？何嘗勇於抗日？竟把抱定不抵抗主義的，當做勇於抗日，敢是在那裏做反　文章麽？我說：這不是反逼文章，這是有書爲證的。我所說的小張，不是東廂記中的小張，却是西廂記中的小張：不是東廂記中和黑馬將軍有關係的小張，却是西廂記中和白馬將軍有關係的小張。這個小張。這個小張，便是張琪張君瑞又稱張解元。小張怎樣的抗日？在西廂記　簡裏面，小張有很激烈的抗日言論：其一：何處縮天有術？便敎逐日日西沈。其二：安得后羿弓？射此一輪落。小張的抗日情緒，要算是很熱烈的了。讀過西廂記的，大槪不會笑我穿鑿附會吧。呵呵。觸目傷心之世界地圖  持佛　　丨見者之感想如何？前天，在下路過商務印書館·見玻牕裏陳列一幅巨大的世界全圖，在世界各强國的疆域上面，釘了各該國的國旗，以爲表職。後來瞧見我國的東三省，已經改了顏色；他的地圖後面，點了一盞電燈，照出大大一塊血色殷然一般的地位，非常令人注目。還有許多條長長的黑線，連綴在英美德法俄意各强國，以表示各强國的注意。一個彈丸般大小的暴日，肩了一面太陽旗，視耽耽，慾逐逐，注意在這一塊偌大的天府之區的東三省。在下　了這幅地圖，心裏非常的難過。以爲偌大一塊東三省土地，已淪亡在日人之手，在這張地圖　來，東三省的土地，不是比日本大五六倍麽，丨日本只有我國四川一省的疆域，東三省不是五六倍於四川麽？而且物產富庶，遍地黃金，自然日本人說是他們的［生命線］非吞併了不可。！我想，我們見了這幅明明白白的失地地圖也許有勤于中罷！又應該曉得這塊紅色的裏面，數十萬義勇軍，正在血泊中掙扎，血肉横飛，槍林彈雨裏度生活，我們住在繁華如海的上海，又應該起了怎樣的感想！　　雖然有幾條黑線遠遠地牽連着各强國，可是鞭長莫及，愛莫能助，也許誰願將人家的棺材，扛進自己的屋裏來；所以這幾條黑線，其實効力等於○，不比月下老人的紅線　。只有一線光明，是東三省人的自救，　所以商務書館主人，在東三省地圖裏面，燃了一盞電燈，去表示東三省人自己快快起來找尋光明呀！　　臨了，我希望瞧見這幅國恥地圖以後，做國民的快快覺悟起來，絲毫不買賣仇貨，團結起來圖自强，雪奇恥！同時，還希望各地民衆敎育館裏先生們，也應該倣製這幅地圖，布貼通衢，以喚醒醉生夢死的國民，眞是一件最緊要的事呢！浣溪紗  劉宣閣（京滬夜車中）黃葉聲中話遠遊。間情欲到海西頭。新凉　睡着簾廉釣。蒼翠山　排　入。蕭疏枊逐晚風柔。惱人眞　可憐秋。上海的將來  金不同丨不可思議的撥展丨上海，不吹牛，不撒謊，不折不扣，是中國第一個大商埠。不拘是經濟學家、政治學家，都說，上海將來的發展，有無窮的希望。下走不懂經濟，政治，但是也敢大膽的說，上海將來的發展，希望無窮。非但希望無窮，無窮希望，或許還要合東西文化於一爐，集南北奇觀於一埠。　　現在上海洋房一天一天的加高，馬路一天一天的放闊，這是都市的面目，這是上海人的歐化。但是將來總有一天，發達得過了分寸，地面上都是洋房，到那時聰明的平民，會得利用挖地窖躱飛機的經騐，在地面下挖一個地窖來做公館。現在上海人，上中下三等，都會得說［也司］，［奥來］，［麥克，麥克］，［必的生司］，［溫大拉］，［康姆賞］等洋話。外國人却都會得說幾句洋涇浜中國話。就是一切用的東西，上海人總喜歡用西式，外國人却拚命的在城隍廟買中國貨。將來的上海，或許要外國人算本地人，本地人變外國人。現在上海不論是幹甚麽，如婚·喪·喜·慶·開市大廉價，關店大拍賣，不論老班是阿貓，阿狗，都要請一班外國吹打（即軍樂隊）來助助聲勢，可知上海人愛好外國音樂，比了中國音樂，來得厲害。所以在最近的將來，禳星·送鬼的道士·超度陰魂鬼的和尙，做起水陸　場，滿台法事來，或許將請幾位潦倒的白俄音樂師，奏奏大套梵啞鈴，壯壯威風。四川的士兵  小兵丨可憐爲軍閥造地位丨據說現在川戰爆發了，這一幕叔姪角鬥的滑稽劇，使人捧腹大笑，抑或淚潮洶湧呢？據我的一位四川朋友說：四川士兵的生活，駐在豐富區域的，每月比較得多一點錢。其他拈據着邊境的小軍閥隊伍裏的士兵，那就苦不可言了。他們的生活費，每月不過三元，大家想想，這兩塊多錢，除伙食之外，還剩幾多呢？明知如此也要幹的四川士兵，不外爲的吃飯問題！雖然是小到無可再小的小軍閥，每佔一個小地方，那個小地方的一切機關人的，就是所收的稅項，也歸他所有，換言之，就是那地方的小皇帝了！唉唉！連年爭戰的四川，全國養兵最多的四川，打一仗當然要犧牲很多的人。然而啊！犧牲的是士兵，陞官發財的還是那些反抗中樞割據地盤的大小軍閥。唉！他們以士兵的鮮血來染紅他們的階級章！他們以士兵的白骨來築成他們的皇宫！至此我擱筆默念三分鐘，謹祈告：士兵們的幽靈，一個個在暴風雨的黑夜裏甦醒過來，執着折斷了的白骨，向那些不顧國家存亡祗圖私利的大小軍閥們打去！談話　邵蠲塵自閩寄丨九腔十八調聽客把頭搖丨言語是形成民族的要素之一。但是，我們貴國的言語，未免太復雜了丨眞是［九腔十八調，聽客把頭搖］。現在，將我個人所知道的，關於一個［我］字，就有下面的幾種說法：丨咱是奉天，晻是山東，矮是福州，呷是婺源，鎖是休寗，碗是南京，我家鎭江，我吱丹陽，哈呢常州，　呢無錫，奴是蘇州，尼是靑浦，儂是上海，忤們揚州，我瓜溧陽，我篤宜興，實奴奉賢，阿拉寗波，雁是湖州。從上面的譯音看來，非但省與省的說話異同，即連縣和縣毘鄰在咫尺的言語也不一樣！有如我這次到福州來，朋友們呌我［吸鋪］，我簡直是莫明其中山陵園，好像鄉姥姥進了大英國，瞠目不知所對，後來經過人的翻譯，方纔曉得是請我去［吃飯］！言語爲有聲思想，這樣不統一，如何能去傳達我們的意見呢？這點，我想與民族性的渙散不無關係吧！願當局者注意之。（稿酬撥助東北義勇軍）入關郵侶　（十四）  求幸福主佟一貞受了魯伯勤的指示，　是一味詞嚴氣正的駁斥與拒絕。惹得叔　們大不痛快，在幾度好言相勸還是不生效力之後，少不得也要發發脾氣，大駡這個忤逆不孝的姪女，是不識抬舉，不懂好夕，中了文明自由的毒，敢於　抗親長的敎訓，若再這樣頑梗不化，執迷不悟，做長輩的便當强制執行，逕行作主了。　但是，家庭的壓力越來得大，一貞的反抗力也越激起得很高，便常吵吵閙閙，大不太平，一貞爲了勢孤力薄，就仍須找魯伯勤秘密商量計策，而恢復了從前形跡上的親密。如此一傳揚開去，使佟家叔嬸們洞悉這其中　結所在，是姪女另有了心上的愛人。爲了諜根本上的對付，必須再限制一貞的行動，剪除伊的外援，才能慢慢逼伊回心轉意。於是勒令一貞不得再上英文夜課，又引起一段軒然的大波；幾乎把魯伯勤也牽涉到漩渦中來，與他們開始了直接的衝突。自此，這爭鬥中的陣容便是這樣；佟一貞雖不再上英文夜館，卻還是每每月上柳梢頭，人約黃昏後，在昏暗冷寂的　衕中，統幾處　角檐邊，仍與魯伯勤隨時隨地的秘密恊商，幷因此更築成一條極堅固的戰線。伊叔嬸那一面，漸漸也覺得正式作戰，不能急速取勝，不如另設陰謀，别出　兵，與高副官和李司令那一方商議，施行一種迅雷不及掩耳的手段，使一貞陷於生米煮成熟飯的局勢，便不怕伊不俛首屈服。像這樣［明槍易躱，暗箭難防，］再把這詭秘的爭鬥多繼續延長下去，最後勝負，誠不可知，佟一貞也或許眞要吃上大虧，魯伯勤必深深懊悔他料事不到。誰知天地間的事情是大不可測，不拘大小問題，都各有它的相應相生離奇　出的變化，佟家叔叔與高副官李司令那險惡的陰謀，還没曾來得及實施；而當地南滿站上日本軍人侵略東北那更毒辣的暴行，竟也與强覇們蓄意要欺負一個無辜的女子一樣，很卑劣的厲行迅雷不及掩耳的處置，已在［九一八］的夜間爆發。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　言眞耶？僞耶梁作友之輸金  佛　　任何希奇鬼怪的事，必有其間接或之飛機，無線之電報，可謂奇矣，但是或借電氣之力，或借空氣之力，科學家不過藉以發明之耳，　　梁作友捐金三千萬元一事，我初即疑之，以爲千字或係十字之誤，後繼續電傳，方知眞實，	現在又變眞實而爲疑問矣，究竟粱作友葫蘆裏賣什麽藥，我輩尙不得而知，不過梁作友居京多時，連一些房金飯鈔，也摸不出，如此富翁，的確，非但不曾看見過，幷且也没有聽見過，是否濟顚聖之游戲神通，還是諸葛亮城頭上彈的琴的空城計，　　梁作友輸金三千萬元一事，其中本有可疑之點甚多，　　一、生產落後如我國，何以家藏七八千萬元財產之梁作友，而其姓氏竟從無所聞，　　一、身寄七八千萬家財之梁作友，何以身居魯東多匪之區，而安如泰山，毫無損失，　　一、梁作友即有財產，何以一擲三千萬元，毫無吝色，即慷慨如華僑，亦未聞有捐助如許巨金之豪舉，　　一、梁作友旣經慷慨之士，何以當馬占山與十九路軍抗日時，而梁某並未聞有分文捐助，　　總觀以上幾點，則梁之捐助巨金，本有可疑之處，今則愈弄愈奇，梁居京多時，非但無分文交到，即房金飯鈔，亦由部中擔保，簡直一錢莫名，誰曾見天下有不名一錢之富翁乎，惟旣無分文，何以敢口出大言，入京請願，其可疑者一，梁非但允輸巨金，即支配用途，亦頗爲研究，俗語所謂像煞有介事，其可疑者二，故說其眞耶，似决决非眞，如說其僞耶，又似非僞，丈二長和尙，眞是令人摸不着頭路　　或曰梁作友之捐金三千萬元，原是一種策略，其實梁祇捐銀一元，他的意思，以爲魯省三千萬人民，若均如梁之捐洋一元，就可得三千萬元，若捐洋二元，就是六千萬元，果如此，眞是滑天下之大稽，梁何不曰捐四萬萬元，我國有四萬萬民衆，若各捐銀一元，即得四萬萬元，若捐銀二元，就得八萬萬元，此種如意算盤之計劃，不僅梁作友腦筋中所有，無論何人，亦多打過此種如意算盤也，　　故梁作友之捐金三千萬元，無論如何，我根本不能相信，文藝敬和樸盦先生開門七事元韵（續）  讓水　　鼻觀親嘗氣失和，半瓶傾倒偶經過，誰家婆子含酸少，此際曹公久浸多，魚溜當筵隨客嗜，雞醯入甕奈君何，漫敎餘味留牙齒，再食靑梅莫問他，（醋）　　淸談茗椀信非難，消渴相如坐一團，秀攝千峯瓶久貯，風生兩腋味曾乾，每聞待客驚雷莢，預計先春糓雨寒，記得晴窓分細乳，追維往事頗含酸，（茶）發育不均  伯雄負責任領薪水科學電目及其用途  左企　　所說電目（Eleotric　Eye）,就是感光性異常靈敏的電器，牠是新近發明的，所以知道的人不很多。然而在過去一年中，感光器具有着飛速的進步，電目的用途日漸頻繁，差不多每天有得發見。在工業方面和日常生活方法，都有極大的用處。自電影院以至工廠，自競技塲以至交通燈，自實騐室以至廚房，在在有需用電目的地方，電目可以别爲四類，每類各有特殊的性質與用途：（一）光電管或光電池丨這是一種眞空或含有某種氣體的電池·内有感光金屬板，受光時即行放射電子。所放射的電子流再用别種眞空管加以擴大。（二）硒電池丨硒是一種原質，牠有一種感光特性：當黑暗時牠的電阻極大，差不多没有電流通過。但在强光之下，便變成良導體，有很多的電流通過。牠傳電的多少與亮度成正比例，就是牠的電阻的大小與亮度成反比例將硒封藏於眞空管裏便成硒電池。（三）光流電池丨這種電池能隨光度變化發生電流變化。（四）氣化金屬板（如氣化銅等）丨受光時能發生比較大的低壓電流。　　無論什麽地方，凡是可用某極方法將一條光綫遮斷或變動或控制的，都可利有上述各種感光電池，以任計算偵察或攝取等工作，同時對於所欲計算偵察或攝取的對象或動作絲毫没有妨碍。譬如欲使一隻標準鐘的擺傳動其他的鐘，而不增加重量於其本身，只須用一條光綫和一隻光電池，便可準確地記錄標準鐘擺的往復運動，而絕不碍及牠的動作。　　在電視（Ｔelevision即無綫電傳影）裏，光電池是一件重要的工具，牠的功用是將物體表面的光度變化變爲電流變化，以便得傳送到遠處去。　　在隧道的出入口裝置光電池，可以計算往來於隧道中的汽車的數目。電影院經理室中備了一種特殊的電表，隨時可以知道電影院裏有多少看客。　　將來電目有一重要用途，即以之調節室内的亮度。正如我們現時用節溫器自動調節室内的溫度一般，我們將用一種［節光器］以調節工塲或敎育内的燈光强度。　　光電器的用作保安裝置已有很顯著的成效。例如穿孔機工人可藉一條光綫和一隻光電池以爲保護。當他的手一入危險區域時，立將光綫遮斷，同時割斷電動機的電流，而那穿孔機便戞然中止了。美國有幾家大的百貨公司在昇降機上裝置光電池安全開關，當有人闖入照射於昇降機路徑中的一條光綫裏時，那開電梯的便不能關門或開機，因而得以避免危險的發生。私人汽車棚上可用光電池裝置自動開門器，當汽車準備入棚之時，駕駛者只須將車頭燈指向暗藏於車棚門口的電目上，那門便呀然而開了，。　　電目在工業及日常生活方面旣有這許多用途，如能稍加研究，更可用之於醫院中，爲病人謀種種便利。譬如醫院中有重大的門須時常開啓，而病人無力自啓者，有了光電裝置，病人一舉手間，門便劃然自啓。同樣一舉手或一搖首的單純動作又可用以打鈴呼喚或發送信號於室外的侍者。當户外天色黑暗時，室内的電燈可以使之自行開亮。又當晨光來臨時，窗牖能自行關閉，以便病人得於暖和的室内舒服地進他的早餐。其他種種妙用，不一而足。　　總之，電目的最大特色便是牠的布置的活動性。無論什麽時候，什麽地方，凡是可用影子或光線來控制一種工作的，這常年不眠的電目總能不倦地盡牠的本分。改良社會討論會採用俗體字之建議  持佛　　自人事日繁，文字的功用愈大了，要是咬文嚼字，摹擬什麽秦漢文，六朝文，桐城派，不但没有這些閒工夫，而且也不夠應用，所以史漢文，駢文，古文，只得讓文學大家去研究，我們爲應用起見，自然要用語體文了，至于字，現在還没有人注意，鄙人却主張採用俗體字，雖然不合于六書，小學，說文，的原理，也没有甚麽關係的，因爲只要應用便利罷了。　　本來文字是一種思想的符號，目下人事旣繁，只要有了記號，也何必說［雅］和［俗］呢，譬如洋幾元，本該寫洋圓，因爲圓字筆畫太多了，便改作元了，！圓又作园，去囗，乃成爲元，！俗體之字很多，冬烘先生見了，必說不通，實則俗體字也有很古的，像俗體字的［祘］便是古的算字，燈古作鐙，俗字寫作灯，筆畫很少，也無所謂俗不俗了。　　從篆籕變作八分書，楷書，從八分書，楷書變作行，草，不過因人事日繁，光陰漸經濟起來，所以要起了變化，成了一種便於書寫的字，俗體字也是一樣的，循着自然的軌道，當然要變化起來，要是說俗體字不可寫，寫了太俗了那末，請你不要寫行草，端端正正描篆隸便了，仔細想來，也許啞然俗笑了。　　總之，採用俗體字的利益很大，（一）便於書寫，（二）時間經濟，在這人事繁冗的時代，實有提倡的必要，試看［速記法］發明以來，不是收了大效嗎，文字本是思想的符號，雅俗兩字不成問題，在下很希望敎育部採及芻蕘，請通人編輯一部［俗字典］呢，要是有研究小學的朋友，也希望另編專門字典，去保存國粹呢，！我國文字，造得很有意義的，譬如男字，从力从田，可知男子應該從事子農耕，不是專爲抱［官財主義］啊，又可證明我國以農立國的，男字上面加　，便是勇字，所以没有勇氣的，不算是男子了，又如勞字，上面有兩個火字，肝火上昇，便是成癆的主因，這又很合于衛生原理的，略舉一二以見一斑。學堂寫眞師生的交換條件  珩珮女士　　在Ｈ校寂寞的一角，英文敎員Ｔ先生和學生Ｓ散課後開始談話了。　　Ｔ先生說：［聽說令兄那寳號營業非常發達，託你要求他一椿事：舍親Ｎ君前在×××號服務，後因某種關係而返里了，現在他又想找事。］［那要先問過家兄一聲。］學生Ｓ說。　　［那總要請令兄帮他忙，吃一口白飯，薪水多少是不論的。］Ｔ心裏雖很急切着，還帶着婉轉的聲調。　　［這一件小事，總可以商量的，不過······］Ｓ不說下去了，等着Ｔ先生問他。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Prospects for the World Economic Conference Ren <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>After the conclusion of the Lausanne Conference agreement on July 9th, the world economy suddenly showed signs of vitality. Stock markets in various countries soared, and commodity prices rose sharply, as if the world panic since 1929 would be overcome by the signing of the Lausanne agreement. However, as time passed, this fleeting false prosperity proved unreliable. Therefore, those who had hoped for the Lausanne Conference had to shift their attention to the future World Economic Conference.</p>
<p>The convocation of the World Economic Conference was originally stipulated in Article 5 of the Lausanne Agreement resolution. The issues specified in the resolution included: (1) Financial issues (currency and credit policy, foreign exchange, prices, capital movement); (2) Economic issues (improvement of production and trade conditions, such as tariff policy, import and export prohibitions and restrictions, and distribution). According to a Geneva telegram on the 3rd, the League of Nations Council Organization Committee decided to convene the World Economic Conference in London in order to promote world economic recovery and implement the Lausanne Agreement on reparations and war debts. For the purpose of preparing for the conference, it was decided to convene a meeting of experts in Geneva at the end of this month. The formal meeting of the Economic Conference will be convened after the expert meeting next month, after research by various governments. It is estimated that it will be around February of next year. Furthermore, according to foreign telegrams, the Preparatory Committee is chaired by British Prime Minister Simon and is composed of representatives from eight countries, including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and Norway.</p>
<p>Currently, the biggest economic problems in the world are war debts, tariffs, and currency. However, when the United States promised to attend the preparatory meeting, it made it a condition that war debt issues would not be discussed and that it would not participate in discussions on silver issues. According to the United States, the war debt issue is a debtor-creditor relationship between the United States and European countries and is not a general issue for the world today. Therefore, the central issues of the future World Economic Conference should be currency and tariffs only.</p>
<p>These two issues of currency and tariffs are inextricably linked. However, whether these two issues can be resolved at this World Economic Conference is a major question. Taking the tariff issue as an example, this issue represents the most intense conflict of interests among countries in the world today. The starting point for the intensification of the tariff war in the world today should be attributed to the protectionist tariffs of the United States. Even Great Britain, which had always embraced free trade, has been drawn into the vortex of the tariff war since the world panic occurred. The emergency tariffs after the suspension of the gold standard, the general tariffs this spring, and the recent preferential tariffs have all clearly abandoned the principle of free trade and entered into a tariff competition war. In this World Economic Conference, the only countries that actually stand in the position of the main body are Great Britain and the United States. Whether these two countries can first have the courage to step back in the meeting is a very big question. In addition, regarding the currency issue, the ultimate goal is nothing more than to raise prices. According to the League of Nations Gold Committee, in order to relieve the world panic, it is necessary to raise prices. One strategy is to encourage major gold standard countries to coordinate their actions to restore wholesale prices calculated in gold to the level of 1928. The second is to encourage paper currency standard countries to follow the British pound as a guide to raise their prices and stabilize them. However, even if these two strategies can achieve their goals, it is still difficult to predict whether they can restore the world economy. Moreover, whether the result of the World Economic Conference can achieve the above two strategies is an even greater question.</p>
<p>The world economic panic of the past four years has become increasingly deep. People place great hopes on the World Economic Conference, no different from hoping for rain during a severe drought. However, judging from the conference itself, the future is difficult to be optimistic about. The United States' unwillingness to discuss the war debt issue deals a significant blow to the World Economic Conference.</p>

However, the funding and personnel are still under consideration, and will be implemented as soon as a decision is made. (16th, special dispatch)</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e58">Japan Focuses all Efforts on the League of Nations <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Not Without Fear Regarding the Attendance of Investigation Committee Members</p>
<p>Results of the US Presidential Election Worthy of Attention</p>
<p>Far East News Agency, Tokyo, 16th – The League of Nations considers the Lytton Report to be of great importance and will hold a council meeting on November 4th to review it. A general assembly of the League of Nations will be held in early December to make a final decision on this issue. At a time when the Far East issue is the focus, intense debates are breaking out in international diplomacy. Japan considers this meeting to be crucial to the rise and fall of the Japanese nation. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has gathered diplomatic elites and established a plenipotentiary department in Geneva to arrange everything in order to fully operate. The new diplomatic lineup of Japan for this League of Nations Council meeting is shown below: (A) Plenipotentiary Representatives: (1) Takashi Nagaoka, Ambassador to France (attending the Council meeting as a Japanese representative), (2) Naotake Sato, Ambassador to Poland, (3) Yosuke Matsuoka, Delegate (also plans to participate as a representative when necessary at the Council meeting). (B) Assistants: (1) Shichiro Yada, Ambassador to Sweden (former Consul-General in Shanghai), (2) Setsuzo Sawada, Director of the Japanese League of Nations Bureau, (3) Takeo Ito, Deputy Director of the Japanese League of Nations Bureau. (C) Advisors: Tsuneo Matsudaira, Ambassador to the United Kingdom. In addition, Isaburo Yoshida, former Ambassador to Italy, who participated in the inspection team as a supplementary member, and Kanzō Shiozaki and Kiyojiro Yoshizawa, secretaries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also plan to depart from Tokyo on the 21st of this month with Yosuke Matsuoka to rush to Geneva and join the plenipotentiary department's activities.</p>
<p>Far East News Agency, Tokyo, 16th – The League of Nations will hold a meeting on November 14th to review the Lytton Report. It has been decided to invite Sir Lytton to participate. Currently, the personal opinions of the investigation committee members from Italy, France, Germany, and the United States will also be included as the basic guidelines for reviewing the report. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was very panicked after receiving this news because it was unexpected.</p>
<p>Teletsu News Agency, Tokyo, 16th – The League of Nations Council on November 14th has decided to invite all investigation committee members, including Sir Lytton, to attend, and to explain the meaning of the committee members themselves when discussing the report. The Japanese government agrees on the principle that the investigation committee members will not participate in the Council's discussions, but if (1) the investigation committee members only answer questions in the Council, and spontaneously refute Japan's claims, and (2) forget the neutrality of the investigation committee members entrusted by the League of Nations, and instead represent the opinions of their own governments and engage in unauthorized acts, the Japanese representative will demand an immediate end to the speech and will comprehensively deny the Council and resist to the end.</p>
<p>Japan Federation News Agency, Tokyo, 16th – It is not yet possible to predict how the League of Nations Assembly, which will convene on November 11th and 14th, will decide the fate of the Manchurian issue. However, this fact depends on the attitude of the United Kingdom and the United States, the driving forces of the League of Nations. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is paying extremely close attention to the future actions of these two countries towards Japan. Among these two countries, the United States is especially noteworthy. The US attitude towards Japan may undergo a major change after the presidential election to be held on November 8th. According to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs's observation, the Republican Party's chances are not good in this presidential election battle. If a Democratic government emerges, the previously aggressive policy towards Japan may be liquidated. Assuming the Republican Party wins again, Secretary of State Stimson will definitely resign because Stimson's relationship with President Hoover is not satisfactory, and Stimson has already failed on issues such as military reduction, reparations, and war debts. The public opinion of the American financial community opposes the American's aggressive policy toward Japan. If the United States adopts a wait-and-see attitude, the United Kingdom will definitely not have the determination to act alone against Japan. If France's attitude remains unchanged, then the chatter of other countries cannot overturn the overall situation.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Miller Newspaper Observes Russo-Japanese Relations <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Fundamental Cooperation Between the Two Countries is Difficult</p>
<p>If Japan and the US Go to War, Russia will Definitely Help the US</p>
<p>World News Agency excerpt from Miller Newspaper: The Soviet Union is trying its best to avoid provocation with Japan before the completion of the Five-Year Plan, knowing that Japan's military victory in Manchuria has caused its ambitions towards Russia to stir. For example, the fishery rights issue is a very large diplomatic dispute. The Russian side has now sacrificed its original claims, granting major concessions to Japan. Previously, there were repeated conflicts between patrol boats on both sides, resulting in deaths, threatening the severance of diplomatic relations. However, the result was actually peacefully resolved, signing a temporary agreement expiring in 1936. At the same time, the Soviet Union's relationship with [Manchukuo] is also superficial due to Japan, but many frictions have arisen in negotiations, which have not been resolved, indicating that the Soviet Union does not respect its new neighbor. (Omission) In short, between imperialist Japan and communist Soviet Union, one side continues its irregular friendly relations, while the other side prepares for a future mortal combat. How should we observe the recent rumors that the Soviet Union is selling crude oil to Japan for its navy? The answer is that this issue can be crystallized into one sentence: if Japan goes to war with a third country, such as the United States, will the Soviet Union continue to supply crude oil to the Japanese Navy? Can Japan rely on this supply? The answer must be no, because if Japan goes to war with the United States, the Soviet Union will want Japan to be defeated and collapse, because Japan's victory is definitely not in the Soviet Union's interest. Therefore, discerning people do not need to pay attention to the so-called oil sales contract. This is just a trick for Japan to deceive Americans. The antagonism between Russia and Japan is still as strong as ever.</p>
<p>Japan Federation News Agency, Tokyo, 16th – In recent days, as the League of Nations Assembly is about to convene, the United States plans to win over the United Kingdom and France to actively confront Japan, and Russia is also advocating a Russo-Japanese non-aggression treaty, causing tension in the world of diplomacy. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered Ambassador to Italy Yoshida and Ambassador to Russia Hirota to return to the country to carefully consider countermeasures. According to observations in official circles, although the United States is making great efforts, the United Kingdom and France do not seem to be changing their pro-Japanese attitude. At this time, if a non-aggression treaty is concluded with Russia, it may harden the attitude of major powers in the League of Nations. Therefore, Japan plans not to respond to Russia's proposal. Therefore, the rumor that Xie Jieshi will hold a Japan-Russia-Manchukuo meeting after arriving in Japan is not true.</p>
<p>Japan Federation News Agency, Tokyo, 16th – The Japanese military has the following views on the issue of Russia recognizing Manchukuo: Russia is very concerned about the stationing of troops in Manchuria in the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol. The completion of Russia's Five-Year Plan requires huge funds. Because it is necessary to borrow money from the United States and France, it has eased its previous attitude towards the League of Nations and is strictly silent on the Lytton Report. From this point of view, Russia will never recognize "Manchukuo" until after the conclusion of the Russo-Japanese Non-Aggression Treaty.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Xie Jieshi Arrives in Japan <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Japan Federation News Agency, Moji, 16th – Xie Jieshi, the "Foreign Minister" of the puppet Manchukuo, his son Jisheng, secretary, and fifteen other entourage members arrived in Moji this morning. Xie said on the ship, "This is my fourth time coming to Japan. This time, my purpose is to represent Pu Yi in expressing gratitude to the Japanese Emperor for recognizing 'Manchukuo' and to discuss diplomatic issues with the Japanese authorities. The important diplomatic issue for 'Manchukuo' now is the relationship with Russia. Russia has already recognized the establishment of consulates in Manchukuo. There are also the Non-Aggression Treaty and the Chinese Eastern Railway issues. For the sake of peace in the Far East, we most hope for cooperation between Manchukuo and Russia."</p>
<h3 id="e61">Japan Proposes Alliance to France <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>British Newspaper Makes Cautious Statement, Denying Rumors</p>
<p>The Japan-Jiang Treaty Contradicts the League of Nations Covenant</p>
<p>Should be Among Those Abolished</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 16th – Today's Sunday Times once again solemnly reaffirmed the claim that Japan had proposed a formal alliance to France, stating that a Japanese representative had verbally proposed this proposal in Paris two months ago. However, at that time, its background had sufficient basis to allow the French Foreign Ministry to immediately consider it. Therefore, the French Foreign Ministry summoned someone most familiar with the Far East issue for advice and decided to reject the proposal, believing that under the current circumstances, such an alliance would be dishonorable.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun quoted the London Sunday Times as saying that the Japan-France Agreement, which was initialed in Paris on June 10, 1907, and the validity of the secret correspondence between France and other countries, have caused fierce controversy. The newspaper's diplomatic reporter wrote: According to the Japan-France Agreement and correspondence, the independence and territorial integrity of friendly countries are respected, and Japan should respect and maintain France's special interests in the three southern provinces of China, while France should also recognize and maintain Japan's special interests in Manchuria, Mongolia, and Fujian. But the current controversy arises because the agreement and correspondence are inconsistent with Article 20 of the League of Nations Covenant, "If members of the League have entered into any engagement which is inconsistent with the terms of this Covenant, such members shall take immediate steps to procure its release from such engagements." Should be abolished. The contents of the Japan-France Agreement are roughly as follows: (The Government of Japan and the Government of France both agree on the independence and territorial integrity of China... The two Contracting Parties, in consideration of the sovereignty, protectorates, and possessions in the vicinity of China, mutually ensure order and peace... The two Contracting Parties, in order to maintain their respective positions and territorial rights in the Asian continent, shall mutually support the peace and tranquility in the vicinity of China...)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Anglo-Irish Negotiations Break Down <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Irish State Refuses to Pay Due Amounts</p>
<p>Tariff War to Begin Again</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th – Anglo-Irish negotiations regarding the 5 million pound annual payments for land annuities and other matters have ultimately failed. Dominion Secretary Thomas declared to reporters after the meeting adjourned at 5:45 pm this evening that the negotiations had no results. When asked by reporters whether the meeting would continue tomorrow, Thomas replied in the negative: "Unfortunately, the negotiations have failed and there has been no progress." He also said that everything would be stated in the House of Commons on Tuesday. Shortly afterward, a communiqué was issued, which read: "Unfortunately, the two sides were unable to reach any agreement, and the negotiations have ended." This round of negotiations was reopened at the request of Eamon de Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, and its failure, while not surprising, is quite disappointing. If the negotiations had been successful, the tariff war between the two countries could have been stopped. The Free State has extended not paying the amounts owed to Britain, including a land annuity of 3 million pounds annually. In order to compensate for the losses, the British government imposed special taxes on goods exported from the Free State to Britain, and the Irish Free State also levied import taxes on British goods in retaliation. Both sides agreed to submit the points of contention to arbitration, but the organization of the arbitration court has been difficult to agree on. Britain argued that the arbitration court should be composed entirely of people from the British Empire, without the participation of outsiders, but de Valera did not agree. This issue became a stalemate. While de Valera was in Geneva, he suggested that the British and Irish governments could reopen discussions, leading to today's meeting, which began at 11:00 am and negotiated until 5:45 pm in the evening, except for a two-hour lunch break, but ultimately ended in failure.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 15th – A person closest to Irish Administrative Leader de Valera told the Havas reporter the following: "The failure of the Anglo-Irish negotiations is largely due to the attitude of the British cabinet ministers. Those like them only attacked the reasons stated by Ireland without putting forward any specific proposals. They do not seem to want the negotiations to have good results. This is what we are most surprised at. But the future still leaves room, needless to say. The tariff war will now begin again. In any case, the current tariffs will definitely be maintained."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th – The abortion of the Anglo-Irish conference, its final act, was the revival of the original arbitration proposal. After the plan for direct negotiations to seek a solution obviously failed, the proposal to submit to arbitration was revived, but the old dispute over whether the arbitration court should be absolutely from within the British Empire is still the final obstacle to resolution. It is said that the Free State representatives were quite disappointed because their reasonable cases were always opposed by Britain, while the British representatives refused to accept South Ireland's argument that land annuities were illegal. It is also said that de Valera even said that if various treaties and agreements were studied in detail, it would be seen that Britain theoretically owes Ireland debts totaling 250 million pounds.</p>
<h3 id="e63">League of Nations Secretariat Reorganization Problem Agreed on Compromise <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Frenchman Avenol Succeeds Drummond as Secretary-General Italians and Norwegians as Deputy, and British, Germans, and Japanese Each as Assistant Secretaries Presented to the General Assembly for Discussion Today</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 15th – Germany made proposals regarding the reorganization of the League of Nations Secretariat. Deliberations took nearly ten days without an agreement, but the small committee specializing in this matter has now established a compromise solution. The committee agreed that no people from any major power can occupy more than two important positions in the Secretariat, and stipulated that a Frenchman be the Secretary-General, an Italian and a Norwegian each as Deputy Secretary-General, and a Briton, a German, and a Japanese each as secondary secretaries. This plan will be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly on Sunday.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 15th – The League of Nations Fourth Committee, after a week of hard discussion, finally passed the regulations on senior personnel of the League of Nations Secretariat by a full vote. In the future, the Secretariat will have one Secretary-General, assisted by two Deputy Secretaries-General and three Assistant Secretaries. Among the two Deputy Secretaries-General, one should belong to a non-permanent member state of the Administrative Council. The Secretary-General has a term of ten years, the Deputy Secretary-General eight years, and the Assistant Secretary seven years. No member state of the League of Nations may simultaneously have two senior personnel in the Secretariat. These rules should be implemented in the shortest possible time, but without prejudice to existing contracts. Judging from the current situation, there is no problem in electing Avenol as Secretary-General for the time being, but when implementing these rules on other senior officials in the future, difficulties will inevitably arise. For example, when Assistant Secretaries expire and are reappointed, and when the heads of various departments are replaced, they will all become thorny issues.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 15th – The League of Nations budget was reduced by 351,531 francs, which was caused by Britain using its pressure. The budget was passed tonight. Secretary-General Drummond, an Englishman, will resign within a few months and announced today that he proposed appointing a German as a secondary Secretary-General to manage the League of Nations' economic and financial affairs. It is generally believed that this move is a price to buy Germany's recognition of Frenchman Avenol as Secretary-General.</p>
<p>Administrator of Danzig Not Yet Decided</p>
<p>Rosting Temporarily Replaces</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 15th – Today, people in the League of Nations stated that the candidate for High Commissioner of Danzig has not yet been finalized, but the Secretariat hopes that it can be negotiated before the Danish Rosting's temporary term expires. It is also heard that the parties concerned have discussed with Canadian representative Massey, but Massey is unwilling to take on the position.</p>
<p>Havas, Warsaw, 15th – Rosling, the new League of Nations Commissioner to Danzig, was born in Sweden in 1893. From 1918 to 1920, he was a neutral representative stationed in France to inspect wartime prisoners. In 1920, he joined the League of Nations Secretariat and prepared many reports on the Danzig issue. His appointment as Commissioner was supported by both Poland and Danzig, who said that he would definitely have good results in the relationship between Poland and the Free City.</p>

He stated that out of the 140,000 police in Germany, 35,000 are city police, responsible for managing street traffic and minor matters; 18,000 are engaged in clerical work; and the remaining 87,000 are under the jurisdiction of the 17 states, not managed by the federal government. Furthermore, the German police do not possess any powerful weapons such as field artillery, and the number of machine guns is regulated by the Allied Control Commission. Even armored vehicles are merely automobiles protected by steel plates, far from comparable to military armored vehicles. To claim that these police have military value is simply laughable. He also stated that the occasional exercises resembling military maneuvers by the police are solely for the purpose of preparing for riot prevention. Finally, he emphasized that comparing this matter to the issue of hundreds of thousands of troops and millions of dollars worth of military equipment is trivial.</p>
<p>Geneva, 15th (Havas) - The chief German delegate to the League of Nations Assembly, Rosenberg, addressed the international press, refuting the French delegate Massigli's explanation of the German police yesterday. Rosenberg's main rebuttals were as follows: (1) The German police organization is not uniform, nor is there a unified command. The national police are divided among 17 states and are unrelated to the federal government. (2) The organization and armament of the German police were determined after several consultations with the Ambassador's Conference and the military supervision committees of the League of Nations countries. This arrangement is precisely to prevent the police from being used in warfare. (3) The rules regarding the police are not secret. These rules show that the purpose of police training is indeed for police duties. (4) The demilitarized zone accounts for about one-sixth of the country's territory. Within this zone, the police are the only force maintaining order. It must be explained that at yesterday's meeting of the Military Affairs Committee, the chairman first stated that the committee's discussion involved this matter, so the French representative had to make a statement. Moreover, the discussion of President Hoover's proposal would happen sooner or later, and the French representative could not control it.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Issue of Location for the Four-Power Conference <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>France proposes holding it within the League of Nations framework, which Germany considers an intentional insult.</p>
<p>The British government is still working to mediate.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Reuters) - Following meetings between British Prime Minister MacDonald and French Prime Minister Herriot, the British government is still actively in contact with the German government regarding the Four-Power Conference. Sources in London with quick access to information are now hopeful that Germany's opposition to holding the meeting in Geneva will not be prolonged. The Hague or Lausanne are both acceptable options for holding the conference. The British government believes that the location of the meeting is not of great importance. What Britain wants is for the representatives of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to meet informally in one place to find a way to continue the work of the disarmament conference, which has been stalled due to Germany's demands for military equipment. The tension between France and Germany seems to be increasing daily. Parisian newspapers criticize Germany's unwillingness to participate in the Four-Power Conference held in Geneva, calling it new evidence of Germany's desire to restore its military strength. German officials, on the other hand, point to the invitation to participate in the Geneva conference as an act of humiliation. They are particularly indignant about the French representative Massigli's statement in Geneva yesterday that the German police are part of the army. At the same time, the statement by semi-official Parisian sources that the Disarmament Conference must proceed, but whether the regulations it adopts should apply to Germany may be left for future determination, is also displeasing to the Germans. German officials believe that France wants Germany to participate in the Disarmament Conference, but is vaguely unaware of whether the decision-making methods can be applied to Germany.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Havas) - German newspapers have published an informal document attributing the responsibility for the failure of the Five-Power Conference to France, and stating that [Germany views the invitation from Britain and France to go to Geneva as a serious insult. If Germany accepts the invitation, it will be greatly embarrassed. This can be seen from the attitude of the French representative Massigli in the Military Affairs Committee of the Disarmament Conference and his actions towards the German police.] The document also stated that Germany does not oppose expanding the scope of the Five-Power Conference, but it is illogical to insist that this meeting, which is preparatory in nature, must be held within the framework of the League of Nations. Berlin, 15th (National News Agency) - According to reports from Paris, France has recently shown a willingness to compromise on the location of the meeting, saying that if Germany allows France's allies, such as Belgium, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, to also be invited to join the meeting, then France can recognize Lausanne as the location of the meeting. However, Berlin still considers this inappropriate. If France must invite its allies, then it seems that non-allied countries should also be considered for invitation so that Germany can participate sincerely.</p>

<p>The Hague, 15th (National News Agency) - A statement from Ms. Blankers-Koen, a famous Dutch female swimmer holding the world record in the 100-meter backstroke, after returning from the United States, has shocked the entire Netherlands. It is claimed that her failure to join the World Games competition was not due to illness, but because she was secretly injected with a basic poison, almost leading to death. According to reports, the lady suddenly fell ill the night before the 100-meter backstroke competition, and was unable to participate. At that time, the authorities officially announced that the lady was suffering from a disease caused by poisonous insects. Now it is known that this poisonous insect seems to be a subcutaneous injection. However, the doctor who initially suspected poisonous insects has not been able to provide absolute confirmation. Ms. Blankers-Koen was a strong rival to Ms. Holm of the United States for winning the swimming event. Ms. Holm's employment by the film company was conditional on winning the sports event. Therefore, her friend secretly plotted to poison Ms. Blankers-Koen, so that she could not participate in removing a strong enemy. Unexpectedly, the result was so cruel. Ms. Blankers-Koen stayed in the hospital for five weeks before recovering, and her life was almost not guaranteed. In the future, she will not be able to participate in swimming competitions for two years, and her bleak future has actually been ruined by this one needle.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Japan Decides to Greatly Increase Troops in Northeast <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Infantry, artillery, and cavalry have been transferred to Shenyang in batches.</p>
<p>Organizing a large-scale international aviation company.</p>
<p>Reorganizing the Northeast Arsenal and greatly expanding it.</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The Japanese side, seeing the futility of the appeasement policy towards the people of the Northeast and the armed resolution of small anti-Japanese organizations in recent years, has decided to change all previous plans and thoroughly eliminate the volunteer armies in various parts of the Northeast. Moreover, the situation in the Northeast has become even more tense due to the armed confrontation between Su Bingwen and Tang Juwu with the Japanese, which has actually accelerated the Japanese side's determination to implement this plan. The news obtained from various sources is compiled and recorded as follows: (1) In order to replenish the casualties and vacancies in the current troops stationed in the Northeast, and to increase their strength, the Japanese military has specially transferred some infantry, artillery, and cavalry from the home country in batches. More than 1,000 people from their original stationed troops have all been sent to the border of Rehe. Soon, the Japanese military will definitely take major actions in Rehe. The so-called armed immigrants are just a smokescreen for the international community. (2) In order to counteract China's opening of a new Euro-Asian air route, facilitate the external airmail of the puppet state, and make it easier to mobilize the home country's air force to bomb volunteer armies, the Japanese side will fund the organization of the "Manchukuo" International Aviation Corporation, sign a contract with the puppet government to give it de facto convenience. Along the South Manchurian Railway and various parts of the Northeast, in addition to all existing airfields, 250 extremely well-equipped aviation stations will be established. All sound detectors and anti-aircraft artillery teams will be attached to them. In order to actively realize this plan, personnel from the Osaka Aviation School, the Army Survey Bureau, and the Aviation Department of Mitsubishi Corporation have been sent to Manchuria to be responsible for carrying out the first batch of 30 pilots and 50 aircraft, which have recently been transported to Shenyang. (3) In order to facilitate the resolution of the armed anti-Japanese civilians in the Northeast, the Japanese side has decided to send personnel to reorganize the former Northeast Arsenal and divide it into five major parts: (A) Department for manufacturing aircraft, including the manufacture of other aircraft and their parts; (B) Department for manufacturing poison gas and other chemical warfare drugs and their raw materials. All the machinery required by this department will be transported from the Japanese poison gas manufacturing plant in Dalian to Shenyang for refitting. The location of its poison gas storage庫, to be set up in Shenyang or Dalian, is yet to be determined; (C) Department for manufacturing and repairing artillery pieces, including an anti-aircraft artillery factory; (D) Department for manufacturing bullets, which will also be responsible for manufacturing the most violent and brutal gas machine gun bullets; (E) Department for manufacturing gunpowder. In addition to these five major factories, if necessary in the future, a radio machinery factory will be established. Taking a comprehensive view of the above-mentioned articles, the Japanese plan is not only to eliminate the Northeast Volunteer Army, but also to plot to occupy Rehe and Mongolia, threaten North China, or even cause a second World War.</p>
<h3 id="e71">He and Kuang Bandits Unite and Flee <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the national army successively recovered the important bandit nests of Xinjie, Jinjiazai, and Honghu, the remnants of He and Kuang bandits were exhausted and had nowhere to return. They fled in different directions. The He bandits attempted to cross Xiangfan into Shaanxi and were repeatedly intercepted by Fan Shisheng, Liu Maoen, and Xiao Zhichu's troops, suffering heavy losses. It is now heard that they are still between Jingshan, Zhongxiang, Jingmen, and Nanzhang, relying on the mountains, forests, and lakes to survive. The remnants of their pseudo-Seventh Division are still in Jiangling and Jianli. They are now led by the notorious bandit leader Xia Xi, and together with the guerrilla teams in the rural areas, they have been reorganized into the pseudo-Independent First and Second Regiments, with Bailu Lake to the west of Honghu as a temporary base. A group of Wang Bingnan's forces has reoccupied Yuyangguan, acting as mutual support to confront the government army. The 48th Division of Xu Yuanquan's Tenth Army and the 41st Division of Zhang Zhenhan set out from Honghu on the 10th to suppress Bailu Lake. On the 11th, the 41st Division captured Longwan, Zhangjinhe, Xujiachang, and Lijiachang, killing 400 to 500 bandits and seizing more than 200 guns. On the 13th, the 48th Division suppressed Wangjiaqiao and Pujiguan. On the 14th, they suppressed Xiaohekou, Shagang, Hujiachang, Baimashi, and Huaqiao, all of which were successively occupied. In the battle of Wangjiaqiao, Huang Xin's brigade completely disarmed Wang Bingnan's pseudo-garrison battalion, seizing more than 300 guns. Another small group fled to Xinchang and Xinkou, and was pursued by Xu Jiwu's brigade to Jiaoziyuan, north of Xinchang, capturing more than 40 bandits and seizing more than 20 guns. Xia Xi's pseudo-Independent Regiment also suffered heavy losses and fled north. The Huang Xin pursuit force had advanced to Linghekou and Zhangjinhe on the 15th, pursuing north overnight. As for the Kuang bandits, after their disastrous defeat in Xinjie and Jinjiazai, Xu Xiangqian and Cai Shenxi gathered the remnants and fled to eastern Hubei. Hao Mengling, Shangguan Yunxiang, Wan Yaohuang, and Wei Lihuang's troops pursued and blocked them, but were unable to stop them. They then disintegrated and fled to the northwest. Except for a few in Susong County in Anhui and Huang'an County in Hubei, it seems that a group crossed the railway. A few days ago, the railway tracks in the Wangjiadian and Weijiadian area of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway were dismantled by bandits, and north-south traffic was temporarily interrupted, probably by these people. It is said that this group is about 3,000 people. On the 14th, they fled to Changlinggang, which belongs to Suixian County in northern Hubei. The resident army, the 34th Independent Brigade, led by Brigade Commander Wei Qijiang, intercepted them, and the bandits retreated to Luoyangdian, which belongs to Jingshan County, and united with the remnants of the He bandits. Now, the various government troops are preparing to encircle the bandits and annihilate them in one fell swoop. They have also stationed heavy troops in Huangpi, Xiaogan, Huayuan, Guangshui, Wushengguan, and Xinyang in the southern section of Pinghan to prevent damage to the railway. In addition, the Kong bandits in southern Hubei fled from Longgang and Yanxia to Jiugong Mountain in Jiangxi. They were recently defeated by Guo Rudong, Xie Bin, Yue Sen, and Tao Guang's divisions. Rong Jingfang's division also launched an attack from Yanglinqiao, which belongs to Tongcheng County, and occupied Daban Town, a vital passage on the border of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. Currently, Guo's division is in Yanxia, Longgang, and Hengshitan, Zhang Gang is in Yangxin and Daye, and Xie Bin is in Huangsha and Daban, each responsible for clearing the countryside. He Chengjun recently went to Longgang to inspect and then returned to Hankou. He plans to go to Yangxin again, then to Daye, Echeng, Tongshan, Tongcheng, Chongyang, and Puqi to inspect and instruct on clearing the countryside and follow-up work. Currently, he has stopped going due to illness. (October 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e72">Fifth Division Recovers Hengfeng County Seat <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Hengfeng is also a bandit's nest.</p>
<p>Remnants of bandits flee north across the Xin River.</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Hengfeng is located in eastern Jiangxi, between Dexing, Shangrao, Qianshan, and Yiyang. The terrain is complex and transportation is difficult. In 1928, it was occupied by Fang Zhimin's bandits. Although it has been recovered several times since then, the bandit influence is so deep that it is repeatedly lost. Two years ago, Fang Bandit took Hengfeng as the center of the two old Guangxin prefectures in the Chihua Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian and Anhui border and the Xin River basin. The pseudo-Jiangxi Northeast Revolutionary Committee, the pseudo-Jiangxi-Minbian Provincial Government, the Red Army School, the pseudo-Postal Bureau, the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, etc. were all set up in the county seat. The pseudo-arsenal and rear hospital were set up in Geyuan, which belongs to the county, which is an important bandit's nest. Last month, when Zhu Mao invaded the north, the Fifth Division of the National Army rushed to Fuzhou from Guixi. The troops south of eastern Jiangxi were thin. Fang and Shao bandits invaded the south from the north bank of the Xin River and invaded northern Fujian and eastern Zhejiang from Guangfeng, Shangrao, and Qianshan. Afterwards, Chong'an and Pucheng were recovered by officials and generals in Fujian and Zhejiang. The bandit pseudo-Tenth Army fled to the border of Fujian and Zhejiang. At that time, the Fifth Division returned to Guixi from Fuzhou, and went east from Yiyang, and made a fierce advance to Hengfeng. At the same time, Zhao Guantao's troops were in the upper reaches of the Xin River in Shangrao and Guangfeng, Li Yunheng's division was on the north bank of the Xin River in Wannian and Leping, and Wang Jin's division was on the south bank of the Xin River in Qianshan He Kou, and encircled the bandits on a large scale. Fulin in Wannian, Zhoufang in Guixi, and Chepan in Qianshan were all important bandit nests that Fang bandits had occupied for many years, and they were successively recovered by the Li and Wang divisions. Hengfeng was the only county that Fang bandits relied on to resist stubbornly. Therefore, Hengfeng was also the last stronghold of the Red Bandits in northeastern Jiangxi. According to military news, Zhou Hunyuan, the commander of the Fifth Division, pursued Fang Shao from Guixi and advanced to Yiyang. At that time, a fierce battle occurred with the bandits. Zhou's division fought bravely and defeated the bandits. The two regiments of Zhou Jianping's 83rd and 84th of the pseudo-Tenth Army were completely disarmed by the government army, and the remaining remnants fled north across the Xin River in a mess. They are being pursued. According to news from the provincial government, Zhou Hunyuan, the commander of the Fifth Division, sent a telegram stating that the division took advantage of the victory to advance on Hengfeng from Yiyang and recovered the county seat on the 5th. The bandit army retreated to the border between Dexing and Yiyang. The county magistrate of Hengfeng is currently concurrently serving as the county magistrate of Yiyang. However, the essence of the county seat has been lost for a long time. The farmers in the four townships have either been turned into bandits or displaced, the fields are barren, and the houses are in ruins. The situation is very miserable. After receiving the news of the recovery of Hengcheng, the provincial government is looking for capable people to appoint as county magistrates, so as to handle the aftermath, recruit refugees, save the dying and heal the wounded, so as to restore vitality as soon as possible.

<p>Li Yue Reports on the Course of Negotiations after Entering Beijing from Jinan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence Li Yue and Fan Yuhuang were sent by the Ministry of Military Affairs to Shahe to inspect the situation at the front, and met with Liu Zhennian's representative Li Henghua twice. The results were quite satisfactory. Li then accompanied Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, the representative of the provincial government, back to Jinan last night. As soon as he got off the train, he met with Jiang Bocheng to report on the situation. This morning, he took the Pingpu No. 201 train again at 9:30 and left Jinan for Beijing to report. Jiang Bocheng, Zhang Lianjia, Wang Kairu and others came to the station to see him off. Because Li Yue had previously served as the director of the Public Security Bureau in Jinan, there were many old friends in the police circle, and many also came to the station to see him off, and there were broadsword teams on guard at the station. According to Li's talk, the two sides in Shandong have stopped military action and are waiting for the central government to resolve the matter. The first step goal can be said to have been successfully achieved. After that, it is only waiting for the second step of follow-up measures to be implemented. I saw Chairman Han this morning to say goodbye. Han Yun said that after returning to Beijing, I hope to report the truth obtained from the investigation to the central government and ask the central government to resolve the matter. I will absolutely obey the orders of the central government, etc. Chief Advisor Jiang (Bocheng) also urged me to return to Beijing, saying that both Chairman Han and Liu Zhennian have expressed their obedience to the orders of the central government. The central government can decide on a resolution plan. Therefore, I am returning to Beijing today to report to the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Military Commission on the course of events. It is not yet certain whether I will come again. If necessary, I may still return. When I met with Liu Zhennian's representative Li Henghua in Shahe the day before yesterday, I said that the cost of artillery shells costs a lot of money. Why waste them? It is better to save the artillery shells for use in foreign wars and not destroy the people's houses in vain. Now, Staff Officer Fan (Yuhuang) is inspecting in Laiyang, and will return to Jinan in a few days, etc. It is also heard that Li Yue and Liu Zhennian's representative Li Henghua met on the 12th and had a secret talk for one and a half hours. Because the security was tight, the content of the talks is unknown. (October 15th)</p>

<p>Xiamen Correspondence He Xianzhu, the deputy brigade commander of the Third Brigade of the Fujian Provincial Defense Army, and Hong Wende, the acting brigade commander of the First Brigade, were secretly escaping from Minnan for plotting to resist the 19th Route Army. On the night of the 12th, they used a Hanjiang wheel to pass through Xiamen from Hanjiang. At noon on the 13th, they transferred to the Japanese wheel Liwan to go to Hong Kong to be protected by the Japanese. When Jiang Guangnai, the director of the Fuzhou Pacification Office, heard about it, he telegraphed the Shantou authorities to detain them when they passed Shantou. Now we have received a telegram from Shantou that He and Hong have been captured. Chen Weiyuan, the official brigade commander of the Third Brigade, and Liang Jichuan, the regimental commander, secretly helped Chen Guohui and got 2,000 guns from Chen's troops and recruited a battalion.</p>

<p>Retreating to the Mountains to Trace the Reasons for Failure</p>
<p>The Way to Self-Preservation Lies in Diligent War Preparations</p>
<p>Discipline and Restore the Party's Democratic System</p>
<p>Restore Freedom and Revive the People's Movement</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: After arriving in Zhangyuan, Feng Yuxiang resided in the Boai Hospital. Recently, Feng expressed his personal thoughts and political views, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"The general public's criticisms of me include both praise and condemnation. The things for which I am praised are what I should do and are my national obligations, and I dare not be arrogant about them. As for the criticisms, they are mainly two points: one is that I go too far in correcting wrongs, and the other is that I am prone to defection. In fact, both of these criticisms do not truly understand my mistakes. I have rarely expressed political views, so people inevitably misunderstand me. From a revolutionary standpoint, any revolution inevitably involves overthrowing the ruling class that oppresses the majority of the people. If one only blindly follows the rulers, there can be no revolution. Therefore, what I have done in the past was to overthrow the ruling class. If we consider it from the perspective of feudalistic subordination, all our revolutionary actions were defections. For example, my campaign in Langfang to suppress the restoration, my overthrow of the bribery-ridden government in Beijing, the expulsion of Puyi from the palace, and the recent wars – should reactionary gentlemen like these be permanently retained on the stage? However, I have repeatedly participated in revolutions without expressing my specific political views, because in the past, I believed that any government that violated the interests of the people and oppressed the people should be overthrown. As for what should be done after the overthrow, I would wait for the virtuous and talented people in the country to solve it. I never had the intention of seizing power for myself, so after overthrowing the bad government, I would automatically resign and invite the leaders of various factions to take over, as evidenced by the situation after the overthrow of the bribery-ridden government. I always wanted to identify the evildoers and resolve to eliminate them. After the evildoers are overthrown, good people will come. Who would have thought that after one group of evildoers left, another group of evildoers would come? Not only are those engaged in revolution exhausted, but the innocent people also suffer repeated sacrifices. This is my mistake, my past mistake of having no clear plan for the revolution. Now I realize this mistake, so in recent years, I have devoted myself to various political, economic, and social issues, as well as revolutionary theories, to seek a political solution after the revolution. As for those who accuse me of going too far in correcting wrongs, I also have an explanation. I came from a poor family and joined the army at the age of seventeen, entirely from the ranks, so I have experienced many difficulties and deeply understand the hidden pains of the lowest levels of society. Naturally, I deeply hate and resent those gentlemen who wear silk and brocade and eat delicacies but do not do their jobs properly. Naturally, I see the various injustices in society and am easily inspired to resist. This is the root cause of my repeated participation in revolutions. My ability to endure hardship also comes from this. Comparing my current life with the past, although I still wear cloth clothes and eat simple food, I feel that my personal living situation is enough. Especially for revolutionaries who aspire to save the world and help the people, why bother seeking personal enjoyment first? Therefore, I want to use my life as a standard, to raise the lives of many, many poor compatriots in society to be like mine. As for those gentlemen who live in extravagance and luxury, I also hope to reduce their living standards. In China, where production is backward, waste should not be tolerated. If the people of the whole country could live the life of an American capitalist, I would naturally not object to the enjoyment of silk and brocade. Therefore, from the perspective of a capitalist, perhaps my simple life is going too far in correcting wrongs and is not close to their human nature. If we are willing to calmly consider, if all the gentlemen in the country lived my kind of life, it would not necessarily be unhealthy. I am afraid that the health of the gentlemen in silk and brocade is not as good as mine. This is from a personal perspective. From a social perspective, if everyone lived like me, it might be possible to slightly reverse the trend of extravagance and luxury, and it might be possible to reduce the consumption of foreign goods. Moreover, frugality can foster integrity, which can reduce the number of corrupt officials. So, is my emphasis on frugality going too far in correcting wrongs, or is the emphasis on extravagance going too far? This is my past situation. As for why I now have a clear plan, since the failure of the war the year before last, I have retreated to the mountains and have had two years of quiet reflection. This has been a perfect opportunity for focused research. I often reflect on the past, trace the causes of repeated failures, and diligently read all kinds of social science books to nourish my thoughts and make me more systematic in seeking a way to transform Chinese society. Using the theories in the books, combined with my past experiences and the current social situation, I have come to two realizations: first, that to work hard for the revolutionary cause, one must have correct principles; and second, that the various current doctrines all have their strengths and weaknesses, especially regarding the initial implementation measures, which may not fully align with the needs of Chinese society today. Therefore, I am addressing the problem by reforming the system. At this critical moment of national crisis, the most ferocious of the imperialist powers, and the one that openly and continuously invades with military force, is naturally Japan. Yet the government not only does not resist, but even fails to plan for self-defense after the fact. Consider that the independence and integrity of any country cannot rely on the support of other countries. To rely on others to build a nation is to become a protectorate. Even elementary school students know this. Therefore, under the military pressure of Japan, the only way is to strive for self-reliance and survival, and it cannot be solved by simply appealing to the League of Nations. We cannot hope that the League of Nations will recover our territory or maintain our border defenses. Moreover, the officials responsible for national defense have adopted a policy of non-resistance. Why should outsiders bother to resist on our behalf? Therefore, I believe that no matter what the diplomatic situation is, we must diligently prepare for war, first making preparations to strengthen national defense. We should gather military leaders and experts to jointly formulate national defense plans and divide the country into national defense zones. All the national armies should be selected by the central government for their elite troops and stationed at important locations. The old and weak should combine with the local people to be responsible for rear transportation and local security, with the police, militia, and volunteer forces responsible. The ordnance factories should be unified and moved to the interior. These are the urgent tasks of war preparation. In past revolutionary wars, those who died for the revolution were not given compensation, the disabled were not given settlement, the wounded were not given awards, and the meritorious were not given recognition. As a result, the parents of the dead and disabled soldiers became beggars, their wives and children were scattered and displaced, and their children were sold in the market. All these facts have led to the loss of military and popular support, and this must be addressed first. All officers and soldiers, even when facing foreign insults, cannot avoid worrying about the future. Now, to inspire the morale of the army, we must first strengthen their faith and encourage their loyalty and bravery. For those who died in battle, the nation should build national shrines, and the villages should build village shrines. Their parents, wives, and children should be compensated, and the disabled should be given preferential treatment and provided with factories to support their lives. A special agency should be established, with designated personnel to handle the matter, and special funds should be allocated within a specified number of months. If the results are not effective, the personnel should be punished. This is the most important thing in war preparation. Secondly, the government should reject nepotism and favoritism, and those who have made meritorious contributions in the real revolution should be quickly identified and promoted. Restore the Party's democratic system, rectify the Party's discipline, and then the party members will be elite and their actions will be unified, so that the Party can be effective. The capital should still be moved to a suitable location to avoid the threat of imperialism. Restore the people's movement, and guarantee freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication. Restore various people's organizations, provide them with military training, implement strict austerity policies, cut unnecessary agencies, implement financial transparency to prevent waste, and strictly formulate regulations for punishing officials for dereliction of duty and corruption to rectify officialdom. Formulate a production plan to meet the necessary consumption principles of the whole country. The state should operate foreign trade, and luxury goods should be monopolized by the state and subject to purchase restrictions. Strictly levy progressive income and inheritance taxes, and stipulate the highest salaries for civil servants and the lowest salaries for farmers and workers. Formulate social insurance laws, establish special agencies, and implement them in practice. Revise the education plan, cultivate talents needed by the country, and provide people with equal opportunities for education. All these are urgent matters that cannot be delayed. Earlier, Mr. Wang Jingwei telegraphed me and asked about my views, and this is what I advocated. Until now, I still believe that if the above points are implemented immediately, and then we actively resist Japan, there will be success. I sent a telegram in Taishan a month ago, saying that if the central government is determined to resist Japan, I and Bai Chuan are willing to go to Nanjing and sit in jail. I am willing to do so, but unfortunately, it has been delayed until now and is still in a state of suspended animation. Now the national affairs are increasingly urgent. If I do not die for the country, the country will die for me. I hope that the people of the country will work together to overcome the difficulties." (October 12)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Unprecedented Fire Disaster in Datong <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Over Eight Hundred Houses Destroyed</p>
<p>Approximately Twenty People Killed and Injured</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Datong and Yuezhou, which belong to Tongling County in Anhui Province, are the most prosperous commercial towns along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province and the gateway to the southern Anhui counties and into Anhui Province. In the past, there were plans to establish four cities: Anqing, Wuhu, Bengbu, and Datong. The importance of its commercial location can be imagined. However, the transportation sector here received a telegram from Datong stating that a fire suddenly broke out on the Hengdi embankment on the island last night around ten o'clock. At that time, the southeast wind was strong, and the weather was dry, so in an instant, the fire had spread wildly. Fireboats on both sides of the river and the navy's Chen-class torpedo boat fire brigade rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. However, the fire was fanned by the wind, and fireballs were flying everywhere. As a result, from the foot of the embankment, passing through the Huainan Public Office, the post office, the road behind, the south bank of the pond, the vegetable garden behind the Ma family, and the area along the river, everywhere was on fire. The fireboats were divided to deal with the situation, and they were exhausted. Houses collapsed and walls crumbled, and the sound shook for several miles. Refugees were running east and west, with no way to escape, wailing and crying miserably, which was extremely tragic. The first battalion of the Datong Training Corps and the Marine Corps of the Chen-class torpedo boat were all armed and suppressing the scene. The fire gradually subsided at one o'clock in the midnight. When riverboats passed by the area, they still saw the sky full of fire, illuminating the river. Although it only lasted for three hours, over eight hundred houses had been destroyed. Seventy to eighty percent of the shops were burned down. The essence of the entire town was almost completely destroyed. The losses have not yet been calculated. According to the initial investigation, in addition to one old man and one child who were buried in the fire, and an unknown number of people who were burned and scorched while trying to move their belongings, there were more than ten people who fell into the river due to running carelessly in the dark or due to being overwhelmed. It was a truly tragic disaster. (October 15)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Huai River Diversion Project is Actively Underway <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Building a Movable Dam at Hongze Lake Mouth and Dredging the Zhangfu River</p>
<p>Organizing Government-Owned滩地on Both Banks and Raising Public Bonds</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Jiangsu Huai River diversion project has been progressing smoothly since it continued on September 1. According to Huang Bokui, the chief engineer of the Pukou Engineering Bureau, the Huai River diversion project was previously suspended due to financial constraints. Also, due to differing opinions on the issues of entering the Yangtze River and entering the sea, the Huai River Diversion Committee of the National Government, in order to avoid opposition from the people in the upstream and downstream areas, decided to allow both to be done at the same time. In terms of engineering, one is to dredge the Jiang Dam and the movable dam at the mouth of Hongze Lake, allowing the water from the Huai River passing through Hongze Lake to enter the sea through the Yan River and the Guan River. This can regulate the water volume of the lake and maintain a fixed amount of lake water. When the water is high, the dam is opened to divert water into the Yangtze River, and when the water is low, the dam is closed to conserve water. The second is to dredge the Zhangfu River to allow the water to flow in a straight line and smoothly into the sea, preventing it from being winding and silted up. In terms of funding, the original budget for the first phase of five years was 49 million yuan. However, the construction of the movable dam at Hongze Lake alone requires 1 million yuan in the first year. This amount differs greatly. The Huai River Diversion Committee is now starting to organize government-owned滩地on both sides of the river, so that this huge amount of funding can be shared by the people and the state. Therefore, raising funds is more convenient than before. The previous proposal to raise public bonds from the local people, with the designated funds as collateral, to facilitate turnover and relief, is expected to succeed. The Huai River Diversion and Sea Entry Engineering Bureau of this committee, originally located at Chenjiawan in Lianshui, has now moved to Qingjiangpu. In short, the committee is determined to continue working hard on the Huai River diversion and complete this huge project, which is closely related to tens of millions of people, in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3 id="e79">The Northwest Reclamation Corps Advocates Thorough Development of the Northwest <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Baotou, the Northwest Reclamation Corps investigation team has been conducting investigations for several months. The team issued a declaration yesterday on the development of the Northwest, which is recorded as follows: "[Everyone in the country knows that today the Southeast is a land of wealth, and its material civilization can compete with Europe and America. The development of the Southeast is far more advanced than the stagnation of the Northwest. However, before the Han and Tang dynasties, the people of the Southeast had unkempt hair and tattooed bodies, and were not worthy of being compared with the advanced people of Qi and Lu. The land was barren and salty, and there were many miasmas and diseases. The people of the Northwest regarded it as a place to be feared and a place of exile for criminals. How is this different from the way the people of the Southeast view the Northwest today? The political center of gravity in ancient times was in the Northwest, and the Southeast was considered insignificant. Today, the center of gravity is in the Southeast, and the Northwest is considered irrelevant. Each is blinded by its own perspective. In fact, the Northwest and the Southeast are both parts of China's beautiful landscape. They are interdependent, each with its own strengths, and their merits cannot be distinguished. However, there is a persistent misunderstanding of this in both ancient and modern times. The investigation team's report is being edited, so there is no need to dwell on it here. However, the Northwest is isolated beyond the borders, while the doors of the Southeast are wide open. The Northwest faces the danger of emptiness, while the Southeast suffers from overcrowding. If we do not break open regional concepts, abandon feudal ideas, and take a deep look at the objective historical perspective of the world, and conduct a thorough investigation to find a reliable way forward, not only will the Northwest and the Southeast never understand each other and never have the hope of balanced development, but China will also face the danger of destruction. Therefore, the investigation team, without regard for hard work and at the cost of all sacrifices, has prepared its own resources and ventured far in the summer heat to do this investigation work. As a result, our gains are more than we had hoped for, and beyond our expectations. We initially thought that the Northwest was restricted too severely by nature and could not develop freely. Who knew that all the natural shortcomings could be easily remedied? How could we compare it to the Southeast's barren salt flats, low temperatures, miasmas, insurmountable mountains, rapidly flowing rivers with many reefs, and dangerous ocean waves, all of which cannot be overcome by human power? To develop the Northwest, we do not need to use Western material civilization's machines, and we can see results immediately. Even using our old spirit of developing the Southeast, we can achieve twice the results with half the effort. The problem with the world is that we do not know the bottom line, so sound, light, electricity, and chemistry all show amazing achievements. Once we know them, all progress is as easy as turning our hand. We now have a clear understanding of the Northwest as the Northwest. The development of the Northwest is as easy as lifting a hand or taking a step. However, the Northwest region is vast and cannot be covered in a short time. For the time being, we will start with Suiyuan and proceed step by step, with Xinjiang as the final destination. Baotou is the end of the Ping-Sui Railway, and goods from the west are concentrated here. From here, we can reach Ningxia and Xinjiang. Since we have taken the development of the Northwest as our responsibility, then after the investigation, we will naturally base our business on this. In addition to actively preparing new villages, immigrating and reclaiming land, we will also take advantage of the winter leisure time to establish a woolen mill in Baotou to help the market and establish a base for the corps, which will be used as a signal for the development of the Northwest. Once all the projects have a beginning, we will move forward until the Northwest and the Southeast coexist and prosper together. Since Qin Shi Huang immigrated 100,000 households here and built the Great Wall along the Yin Mountains to demarcate it, the Hetao area has been included in the territory since the Han and Tang dynasties and treated as the inland. However, we are not good at management, and we still treat it as a desolate and remote area, which is not as good as the Europeans and Americans who came here to preach, who regard it as a paradise and call it the Catholic Kingdom. Now, the Suiyuan Provincial Government has taken measures to cultivate soldiers, civilians, and Mongols, and this corps will also cultivate agriculture, industry, and commerce to thoroughly develop it. It is hoped that the whole country will be united, with those with wealth investing and those with strength joining the effort. Many hands make light work, and if we inspire hidden potential and strengthen national defense, we may have a chance of success. This is our declaration.]"</p>
<h3 id="e80">Shen Honglie's Plan to Prosper Qingdao <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Expanding the City Area, Dividing into Industrial, Commercial, and Residential Zones</p>
<p>Expanding Roads for City Residents to Visit Scenic Spots</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Rotary Club of Qingdao held a luncheon at the International Club on the 13th of this month. In addition to members, leaders from various sectors of diplomacy, industry, and commerce, both Chinese and foreign, were invited to dine together. During the luncheon, Mayor Shen Honglie gave a detailed speech on the plan to prosper Qingdao, which can be summarized as follows: "Today, I am honored that President Mei Weiliang of this club wants me to talk about my work matters with you. I am very interested, because if I speak from my own position elsewhere, I will inevitably involve politics. But today, I am purely speaking as a member, making a friendly talk and can only discuss our immediate problems, without involving other matters. Regardless of whether what I am talking about is right or wrong, you will surely forgive me and need not have many concerns. My work in Qingdao, if speaking in business terms, can be divided into two parts: livelihood and life. The livelihood part, in order to seek prosperous business, must have a considerable area. This area can be divided into two types: land and harbor. On the land side, we plan to expand the city to the line of Cangku and Damai Island, and the northwest sides within this line, about twice the size of Qingdao City, are designated as industrial and commercial areas, so that factories, shops, and all residents can gradually increase. On the harbor side, in addition to building the new Fifth Pier, we plan to gradually build other piers along the Fourth Pier and try to fill in the beach connecting the Fourth Pier and Sifang, turning it into industrial, commercial, and pier land. As the sea and land gradually expand in this way, the city's industry and commerce will surely develop day by day, and the livelihood of Chinese and foreign citizens can be resolved. On the life side, in order to seek a comfortable life for the citizens, there must be a scenic and elegant residence. In recent years, the city has gradually developed, and there is already the problem of expensive land and crowded people. In the future, we plan to gradually equip all roads and water supply and drainage systems in the area along the coast from Zhanshan East to Damai Island, facing the sea and backing the mountains, about equal to the size of Qingdao City, and develop it into a residential area, specially for high-class men and women to live in. After the road network is completed in the future, the farthest point can reach the city in about an hour, and the air is clear, the scenery is beautiful, the seawater bathing beach is beautiful, and the convenience of living is better than living in the city. As for Laoshan, which is a scenic spot in the city, although it is far from the city, it can be used for leisure tours. We plan to first build roads in various scenic spots in the mountain area to connect them and facilitate transportation. Then, we will promote the construction of hotels or villa villages in scenic places. The tap water can be filled with mountain spring water, and electric lights can be set up according to the needs of various departments. Not only can the people of the city enjoy themselves at any time, but also the summer resort tourists can enjoy the mountains and rivers at their own leisure. In this way, we have this adjustment in our lives, and we will not feel dry and cramped. In the future, the customers who patronize the city may also increase because of this, and the business of our store's livelihood department will surely prosper as a result. In addition, the supplementary matters of tap water and telephones are also important issues in the city. The short-term solution for tap water has been decided, and the water volume can be increased by 100,000 tons per month before March next year. Based on past experience, there will be a surplus in two years. As for the telephone bureau, it is directly under the Ministry of Communications and is not within the scope of the city, but the telephone bureau here has decided to add 400 units before April next year, no matter what, and reduce the installation price to comfort the desire of the Chinese and foreign people in the city. These two levels are also related to the master plan of life, so I will mention them together. The above is the business plan of our store, but the capital that the enemy has is only spirit and labor, which is very limited. This club brings together various talents and is intended to be a place for mutual research, and both livelihood and life are necessary for everyone, so I hope that you will give more suggestions so that we can achieve the above goals. Then, not only will our store gradually prosper, but also your livelihood and life problems can be solved satisfactorily." (October 14)</p>

<p>Jiujiang Correspondence: When Xiong Shihui, the chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, was the commander of the Songhu Garrison in Shanghai, he was very close to Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Yansong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chamber of Commerce. During the summer vacation this year, Xiong sent a telegram inviting the two to Gan to escape the summer heat in Mount Lu and plan for the development of Jiangxi's industry. At that time, the two were on a trip to Qingdao and could not make the trip. Now it is a clear autumn, and the two are excited to travel. They sent a telegram to Xiong on the 11th of this month, saying that they would come to Gan for a tour to repay his kindness. After receiving the telegram, Xiong immediately sent Fan Zhengbo, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Consolidation Committee, to Xun to greet them in person, because Fan was also very close to the two when he was a member of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department. On the morning of the 12th, at 8:00 a.m., the two indeed took the mail plane from Shanghai. Fan Zhengbo and business leaders had heard the news in advance and went to the airport to wait. At about 1:00 p.m., they saw a green plane coming from the east. After circling for a few weeks, it stopped at the China Aviation Corporation airport. The two calmly got off the plane and shook hands with the welcomers. After a brief greeting, they took the welcome car prepared by the Magnetic Chamber of Commerce and went straight to the Huayuan Hotel to rest. At about 3:00 p.m., Fan Zhengbo and Li Zanhua invited the two to visit the scenic spots in Xunpu, such as the Gantang Lake, the Martyrs' Cemetery, and the Ling Lake. After visiting around, a banquet was held at the Zhenxing Hall to celebrate. The next morning at 7:00 a.m., Fan accompanied the two to Nanchang by Nanxun car. At 1:00 p.m., they arrived directly in Nanchang and stayed at the Jiangxi Grand Hotel. At about 2:00 p.m., they went straight to the Provincial Government to meet Xiong, who received them in person and expressed a warm welcome. They said goodbye at about 4:00 p.m. In the evening, Xiong held a banquet at his private residence to entertain them, and invited provincial dignitaries such as Yuan Liang, Fan Zhengbo, Wu Jian, Tao Huangguangdou, etc. to accompany them. After the banquet, Fan Zhengbo invited the two to visit the scenic spots in Nanchang, such as Qingyunpu, until late at night before returning to their residence. On the 14th, the two received a telegram from Chairman Jiang and said goodbye to Xiong and set off to return to Xun. At about 1:00 p.m., they returned to Xunpu. They did not stay in Xun and took a car to Lianhua Cave and changed to sedan chairs to visit Guling. They stayed at the Hu Jinfang Hotel in Guling for one night and visited scenic spots such as Hanpo Kou and Xiaofu Pool. On the 15th, they went down the mountain after enjoying themselves. At that time, Fan Zhengbo of the Provincial Consolidation Committee came to Xun from the province on official business, and invited them to a wash-dust banquet and took a photo to commemorate. At 11:00 p.m. that night, they took the Yichang wheel of Taikoo Company and sailed upriver, and would arrive in Hankou at about 2:00 p.m. on the 16th. (October 15)</p>

<p>All Silk Factories Resumed Work Today: The county-wide silk factory strike has seen considerable progress since He Yushu, Li Mingyang, and Zhang Gongren came to Wuxi to mediate. Work was originally scheduled to resume on the 16th, but the factory owners requested a slight delay to prepare for the resumption. Therefore, all factories resumed work uniformly on the 17th. The mediation meeting originally scheduled to be held at the county government yesterday has been postponed until after the resumption of work. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, factory owner representatives Cheng Bingruo, Xue Shouhuan, Xie Youan, and over twenty others visited Commissioners He, Li, and Zhang at the Railway Hotel to report on the strike's progress and the silk factories' recent situation. The commissioners explained the provincial government's intentions and urged them to resume work immediately. The factory representatives stated that they were willing to resume work, but that they had attempted to resume work three times between the 11th and 13th, but were stopped due to disturbances by female workers. If they were to comply with the order to resume work immediately, they feared that more accidents would occur, causing greater losses to the factories and affecting public order. They felt this point should be considered. Commissioner He said that the provincial government had sent security soldiers to Wuxi for protection. If anyone intentionally incited or attempted to disrupt the situation, they would be severely punished and shot on the spot. Therefore, this point should not be overly concerned about. After a long discussion, it was decided that work would resume uniformly on the 17th. After the factory representatives left, they held a temporary members' meeting at 3 PM to report on the meeting with Commissioners He, Li, and Zhang, and then sent notices to their colleagues, stating that they would resume work uniformly on the morning of the 17th. At the same time, the Silk Factory Industry Workers' Union also held a representative meeting, where Commissioners Li and Zhang spoke, stating that anyone who intentionally disobeyed the guidance would be held fully responsible for the labor unrest and would be severely punished. The representatives then made three demands: (1) Wages of 57 cents, and full wages for employees and silkworm raisers. (2) Work hours limited to six hours up and six hours down. (3) The factory owners would be responsible for the post-incident care of female workers injured in the conflict under the Gongyun Bridge on the 13th. Commissioners Li and Zhang accepted these demands. The representatives then decided to comply with the order to resume work on the 17th. At 4:30 PM, Wu Dexin, Director of the Public Security Bureau, believing that it was necessary to question Chen Mengqi, the worker representative from the Chuansantai Silk Factory, about the labor unrest, ordered two detectives to bring Chen to the bureau for questioning and then ordered him to return. However, it was rumored that Chen had been arrested, so members of the Gongyun Association petitioned Zhang Gongren of the Provincial Party Committee, but the misunderstanding was soon cleared up. It was also heard that when Commissioners He and Li came to Wuxi, the provincial government had issued a formal order that anyone who disrupted order or incited labor unrest could be shot on the spot. Furthermore, Gu Zhenglun, the commander of the Gendarmerie, had also issued an order to Wuxi, instructing them to use military law when necessary to suppress those who disrupted public order in order to maintain local security.</p>
<p>Gang of Kidnappers Smashed, Hostage Rescued: In Xue Dian Township, Da He Tou area, District 12 (Biaobeishi) of the county, Weng Zhendong, a wealthy man of 22 years old with over 400 mu of good farmland and substantial wealth, was suddenly robbed on the night of the 29th of last month at 1 AM. He was robbed of over 1,000 silver dollars' worth of clothing and taken away. His family came to the city to report to the County Bureau, requesting the rescue of the hostage. Wu Dexin, Director of the Public Security Bureau, considered the case significant and, as instructed by the County Magistrate, offered a reward for information. However, no news had been received for over half a month. On the 10th of this month, Weng's family received two letters from the kidnappers, demanding 3,000 yuan in cash by the morning of yesterday (15th) at Furong Mountain, or the hostage would be killed. Weng's mother, He, felt that the kidnappers' attitude was too harsh to deal with, and had no choice but to report to Zhu Meiji, head of the 8th District Security Corps. After receiving the report, Chief Zhu immediately dispatched militiamen disguised as farmers and ambushed the foot of Furong Mountain. At the same time, Weng's younger brother, Feng Nan, and a farmhand went to the meeting place and contacted the two kidnappers. Chief Zhu surrounded them from behind while they were talking and captured the two kidnappers. After interrogation, he sent militiamen to escort the two kidnappers to the corps headquarters for detention. He then personally led detectives to Tushan Bay, near Xicang, based on the information provided by the kidnappers, and arrested 14 major criminals, including Xu Fengchi and Zhuang Shigen. They also rescued the hostage, Weng Zhendong, and brought them all back to the corps headquarters for temporary detention. They plan to submit a written report to the county government today for legal action and to issue warrants for the arrest of the gang leaders for severe punishment.</p>

To avoid social obligations, only Director Li Mingyang, an old friend, was notified in advance. After Zhu arrived in Zhenjiang, he stayed at the provincial residence, and Director Li arranged for Director Jiang to take care of everything and sent a naval warship to escort them to Jiaoshan for sightseeing. It is said that Zhu planned to go to Yangzhou today and return to Nanjing tonight.</p>

<p>All District Chiefs File Complaint Against County Magistrate: It is said that County Magistrate Li recently accompanied Xie Fuqiu of the Provincial Committee to inspect the security corps in various districts. When they arrived in the 7th district, the district chief, Wu Dongye, was not there to receive the security guards of County Magistrate Li, and they were beaten and severely injured. This stirred up the public outrage of all district chiefs. In addition to Wu Dongye filing a lawsuit, Zhu Wuchang and all other district chiefs jointly filed a complaint with the Provincial Civil Affairs Department today (14th), requesting severe punishment for County Magistrate Li and the assaulting guards in order to uphold the law.</p>
<p>Bandits Rob Da Lu Township: Since the beginning of autumn, bandit activity in the four rural areas of the county has been rampant, with kidnapping and looting occurring daily. A few days ago, several dozen bandits armed with guns came to Da Lu Township and went to the homes of over ten farmers, including Chen Zengrong, to search. They looted silver dollars, clothing, rice, and other items. The losses are said to be quite substantial.</p>

<p>Automobile Accident on Highway: Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway, there have been two accidents on the Zayan section, resulting in the deaths of two children. A few days ago, near the Liuzhai residence of Liangzhuangxiang Fork Road Bridge, dozens of cars sped by in succession. Many villagers stood by the roadside to watch. Jia Youchang, an apprentice in a woodworking shop, crossed the highway in the dust and was knocked down and crushed, suffering serious injuries and bleeding profusely. The car did not stop to rescue him but sped west. It was also reported that a car overturned on the seawall four or five li south of Haiyan, and all the occupants were seriously injured.</p>
<p>Silk Fabric Merchants Still Import Japanese Goods: Shenghexiang Silk Fabric Store in front of the North Temple previously swore an oath to the Anti-Japanese Association not to import Japanese goods. However, the owner of the store has been secretly dealing with Japanese merchants. Ignoring his oath, he recently sent his staff to the Japanese merchant Taishan Yoko in Shanghai to purchase five pieces of Qiaoqi brand velveteen. That night, they were transported by the Qingji night shift boat to Pinghu. The boat was intercepted by the local Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in Zhujing, and the goods were confiscated. Yesterday, Shen Hongfei, a clerk from the association, came to Pinghu to explain the situation to the Anti-Japanese Association and requested that a fine be imposed as a warning.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Letter from Wuxi County Girls' High School <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor of Shenbao:</p>
<p>We are writing in response to the news item published in your local news column on October 15th, titled "Wuxi County Girls' High School Cook Complains of Injustice in Prison." After careful review, we find that the content of this article is completely inconsistent with the facts and is truly shocking. The food expenses for our school's students and faculty were determined through mutual agreement and cannot be changed arbitrarily. When settling accounts this time, the calculation was based on 17 cents per day per person, exactly as agreed, and there was absolutely no reduction of 2 cents. The facts are clear and the accounts are available for verification. As for the claim that Mr. Guo Zhengmo's demand for compensation was not met and that Mr. Guo was slandered, these are vicious and baseless accusations. They are the words of a rogue and not worth refuting. Furthermore, this case is currently being handled by the court and will be decided according to law. Therefore, it is not necessary for our school to say anything further. However, we fear that a lack of understanding of the true situation will lead to confusion and rumors. Therefore, we have prepared this letter to correct the record.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Wuxi County Girls' High School</p>

<p>Wins Initial Battle Two to One Against the "Lax"</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Goalkeeping Performances Amaze the Entire Stadium</p>
<p>This year's Donghua team is truly well-rounded in talent and strong in strength. Yesterday, they made their first appearance in the Western Football Club's A-League, facing the brave and skilled "Lax." The earth-shattering battle captivated over 12,000 spectators from both the northern and southern parts of the country. At the end of 90 minutes, the referee announced the ceasefire, with a score of two to one, resulting in a victory for Donghua. The referee was Stanwa, and Donghua's honorary doctor was Dr. Fang Jiacheng.</p>

<p>Yesterday's battle, instead of being called a contest between Donghua and "Lax," would be better described as a contest of skills between the two Chinese and Western goalkeepers. Why? Zhou Xianyan is undoubtedly a first-class figure, and Tewit is also a leader in his field. Both were under the sharp fire of the opponent and endured extremely difficult circumstances. They both showed their skills, resisted all kinds of clever tactics, and ultimately emerged victorious. Zhou Xianyan's strength is stronger than Tewit's, which has been powerfully proven.</p>
<h3 id="e95">A Clear Distinction on the Merit List <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Donghua team deployed its lineup, but lacked the key inner defender Li Ning. As a result, Feng Lianyou was moved to inner defense, Tu Kaiyuan played center, Yang Renwei filled Tu's position, and Guan Xun'an and Wu Youliang remained in their original positions. Even with this small change, the interior sometimes felt shaky. However, amidst the turmoil, we were able to find loyal and devoted individuals, such as Feng Yunyou, who played both inner and outer defense, and whose iron hooves terrified the enemy. Wu Youliang has shown remarkable progress, showing the style of Sun Sijing and making great strides forward. Tu and Guan also fulfilled their duties. Yang's performance as a forward was not his usual skill, but he improved in the second half. Wan Xianghua has a great heart and advances like a lone horse among thousands, often with amazing results. It is a pity that the central generals were always hampered by internal panic and could not unite against the outside world. Otherwise, many more goals could have been added to the record. Li Yichen's shooting, combined with Chen Hongguang's agility and Chen Jiaqiu's liveliness, added the finishing touches, but due to internal turmoil, they could not exert their full strength. Chen Yutian was not in good form and did not contribute much. He will have to wait for another opportunity to redeem himself. How was Zhou Xianyan? As mentioned above, in short, he is the number one hero in Donghua's victory.</p>
<p>"Lax" Talk about "Lax" again, Tewit's defense of the iron gate was a great contribution. Central defender Maeda handled the situation with ease. The inner and outer lines were interwoven. The inner defense line was usually tied up on both flanks of Donghua, so it was very active. The central three forwards truly showed their exceptional talent, but the two wings were just so-so, and right winger Beiker showed some improvement, because his monitor was not his opponent.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Deciding the Outcome in Ninety Minutes <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>First Half At the start of the battle, Donghua launched three consecutive attacks. Chen Hongguang headed the ball once, and Li Yichen headed it again, but both were ineffective. Li also kicked the ball wide. "Lax" showed its strength, and Atige was the first to test the goal, but retreated without success. Afterwards, the forwards on both sides launched fierce shots, and the two Chinese and Western goalkeepers mustered their spirits and resisted with all their strength. It was truly impossible to break through, a sight to behold. Donghua conceded first, but it was not the goalkeeper's fault. The goalkeeper was blocked by a rush of players, exposing the goal, and the ball flashed in from Atige's foot. After the initial shock, the spectators saw Wan Xianghua on the left wing take a lone horse deep into the enemy's territory, and the enemy's defenses collapsed. A pass was sent into the center, and Li Yichen swept it into the goal. The sound of cheers overflowed the stadium. At the end of the first half, the score was tied at one to one.</p>
<p>Second Half Wan Xianghua made an amazing move first. Chen Yutian's shot was weak, and the goalkeeper easily picked it up. Wan made a second contribution. Li Yichen was in the right place and kicked the ball in. The goalkeeper was caught off guard, and the iron gate fell. Donghua took the lead by two to one. After that, there were storms in front of both goals, but thanks to the efforts of the goalkeepers, any shot was difficult to score. "Lax" was in trouble and surrounded Donghua, launching fierce attacks, but the defense was effective, and their wishes were not fulfilled. In the end, Donghua still won by two to one.</p>
<p>Pole Vault Feud: The competitors in the pole vault are none other than Cao Yu, Shi Huange, Li Lin, Bai Naite, Hua Weike, and others. Therefore, every competition is a fierce battle between these individuals. Looking back at recent track and field competitions, such as the China-Youth Ma Ling对抗, the Six Groups vs. Ma Ling competition, and last year's Jiangnan vs. Ma Ling对抗, the competition for the pole vault is always intense. Among them, Cao Yu and Hua Weike fight to the death every time they compete to determine the winner. This year, Chen Ling, a main force from Nanjing Central, has been added, making the competition even more fierce. However, Cao Yu and Hua Weike are still fighting to the death for second and third place. It can truly be said that they are destined to meet. As a result, Cao Yu, who had been out of practice for a long time due to surgery, was surpassed by Hua Weike and fell to third place. However, Chen Ling's first place is as solid as a mountain, and Chu Yinghuan's fourth place is also easy to obtain. With three out of four places, it can be said to be a golden age.</p>

<p>Triple Jump is China's Fatal Weakness: The Japanese athlete with the small, bald head that is most laughable has been lifeless for the past two days since joining the International Games. Unexpectedly, in the last event of the field events, he suddenly made a splash and showed his monk-like power. An enemy is still an enemy. Our great conference championship was actually sabotaged by him, and the points that we had budgeted for were forcibly taken away, causing us to fall short of the championship by exactly two points. This is extremely unfortunate. However, the reporter should also say that it is fate and luck that the Chinese team did not win the championship. When we came to the triple jump, Xiao Dinghua's thigh muscles suddenly hurt, and Wang Jihai's heel pain recurred, making it impossible to land on the ground. Even if they wanted to fight to the death, they could not exert any strength. An examination of the results showed that the Japanese athlete Komatsu's first place result of 13.24 meters was actually beyond the reach of Xiao and Wang. From this point of view, we can't blame fate or others. We should blame ourselves for not making progress.</p>
<p>First Place Komatsu (Japan) 13.245 meters</p>
<p>Second Place Kerschner (Russian) 12.70 meters</p>
<p>Third Place Xiao Dinghua (China) 12.63 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Place Okamoto (Japan) 12.62 meters</p>

<p>China Ranks Second by Two Points</p>
<p>Great Britain Wins the Championship with Eighty-Three Points, China Eighty-Two Points</p>
<p>The Performances of Other Countries' Athletes in this Session are Excellent, China Sadly Shows Little Progress</p>
<p>The British track and field team won the third Shanghai International Games championship with its victory in the relay race, defeating China 83 to 81. China's failure to win one of the three relay races was the key to losing the championship. Although China's triple jump, in which it was very confident, only resulted in Xiao Dinghua taking third place and scoring two points, this was also China's fatal weakness. Although China's failure to win the championship in this International Games cannot escape the above-mentioned reasons, instead of blaming it on bad luck, it is better to say that our results are not as good as others. Almost all of the champions in all track events were won by British athletes, and British athletes did not excel in any field events. They relied solely on their outstanding track and field talent to win the championship, which is sufficient proof of their strength in track and field events. The Chinese athletes should increase the number of experienced coaches and devise strategies on how to fight and win. Looking at the results this time, most of them were created by foreign athletes. After this painful experience, can the Chinese people not make extra efforts? Last night, at the start of the closing speech, Mayor Wu said that he hoped that the results of the fourth International Games next year would be even better. The reporter said that he hoped that the Chinese athletes would make up for their mistakes and not let others take the credit again next year. Perhaps today's failure will be tomorrow's success. Let us all encourage each other.</p>

<p>Putting requires weight, so it is extremely difficult for Chinese people to get involved in this sport. Last year, Chen Baoqiu, the Iron Bull, won the championship with a throw of 11.48 meters, setting a record in the Shanghai International Games that had never been achieved before. This year, however, a new force has emerged. The White Russians have a lot of talent in heavy throwing. On the Chinese side, in addition to the Iron Bull, there is also the new force of Leng Peigen, but they are definitely not their enemies. The competition results were as expected. The results were outstanding. Loson set a Shanghai record that had never been achieved before with 12.525 meters, and it was also an unprecedented result for China. Although Chen, the Iron Bull, had his former style, the enemy was too strong, and he could only lament that his heart was willing but his strength was not enough. He was satisfied with taking second place. Leng Peigen fell to fourth place. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>First Place Motovki (Russia) 12.525 meters</p>
<p>Second Place Chen Bao (China) 11.43 1/4 meters</p>
<p>Third Place Arazh (America) 11.35 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Place Leng Peigen (China) 11.05 meters</p>
<p>The United States Competes for Glory in the Javelin Throw: The United States was a strong competitor for China in last year's International Games, with its athletes occupying the top spot in both track and field events as many as nine times. Unexpectedly, it has declined this year. If not for the javelin throw, the excellent first-place award, the brilliant silver cup, would have had no share for the United States. Although it was a desperate move, its score of 47.65 meters was indeed a highlight of yesterday's field events. The Ma Ling conscripts sitting in the audience were all overjoyed. Wang Jihai, Liu Jiayu, and other Chinese javelin stars did their best, but their scores were too far apart and they were unable to achieve any success, falling to second and third place. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>First Place Hutsun (America) 47.65 meters</p>
<p>Second Place Liu Jiayu (China) 44.67 meters</p>
<p>Third Place Wang Jihai (China) 43.12 meters</p>

<p>100 Meters: English Runner Dispute - The two main British athletes, Waller and Hurst, both achieved a time of 11.3 seconds in the preliminary rounds the day before, tying for first place. Unexpectedly, after being penalized twice for false starts in the final, the British team protested the referee's decision. After several negotiations, it was still decided to use the preliminary round results (details in another article). It was generally believed that they would surely win. China and England each had three athletes competing, making the competition exceptionally fierce. Ultimately, our team's performance was not as good, and we had to concede defeat. Waller won the championship with a time of only 11.2 seconds, Hurst came in second, and Wang Jihuai and Hao Chunde tied for third.</p>
<p>200 Meters: Fu Jincheng Strives - Fu Jincheng's time of 23.3 seconds in the preliminary round was the best. Hurst, who was defeated by Fu, was known not to have exerted his full strength and was only seeking to qualify. Therefore, the competition between Fu and Hurst in yesterday's final was highly anticipated by the audience. As expected, Hurst won first place with 23.6 seconds, Fu Jincheng fought hard to secure second place, Horace came in third, and Arash came in fourth. In the first 100 meters of the race, the American Arash unleashed his power and almost overwhelmed all the other competitors.</p>
<p>400 Meters: Excellent Performance - The Englishman Eckel achieved an outstanding time of 52.2 seconds in the preliminary round. It was generally believed that he would undoubtedly win the championship in yesterday's final. Unexpectedly, his time was reduced by another two-tenths of a second compared to the preliminary round, demonstrating his profound skills. England won a total of ten points in this race, and their momentum was overwhelming. The Chinese Customs Superintendent, Guan Changfa, gave it his all, but only managed to secure fourth place. This was due to a significant difference in skill, and it was impossible to demand more.</p>
<p>800 Meters: Long-Legged Xian is Fierce - The British "Long-Legged Immortal," Besant, won the 1,500-meter championship the day before with a time of 4 minutes and 21.4 seconds. Yesterday, he once again delivered a beautiful performance, winning the 800-meter championship. His time was only 2 minutes and 4.8 seconds, which was highly satisfactory. Upon investigation, apart from Yu Xiwei, who once reached 2 minutes and 1 second, the rest of our country's athletes are far behind.</p>
<p>The Chinese participants, Dong Shuzhao and Xia Xianzhuan, secured the third and fourth positions, respectively, and their performance was also quite strong. The second place went to the American, Breckenridge.</p>
<p>10,000 Meters: Wang Zhenglin Takes Second - The British team has many sprinters, but unexpectedly, they also have a long-distance runner like Kenner Tai, who runs like a celestial horse in the 10,000-meter race. As a result, Wang Zhenglin finished behind Kenner Tai by 250 meters, settling for second place. Fifteen people started the race. In the initial 1,000 meters, Ken and Lu Bingsheng were neck and neck in the lead, with Wang Zhenglin and Jin Zhongkang following closely behind by 30 feet. In the next 2,000 meters, Ken and Lu gradually increased their speed, and Wang's distance widened slightly. The two Russians gradually overtook Jin Zhongkang. At the 3,000-meter mark, Ken and Lu's pace seemed to slow down, while Wang Zhenglin closely followed behind, with a distance of about 50 feet. After Jin Zhongkang fell behind, he stepped forward at the 5,000-meter mark. After running 6,000 meters, Kenner Tai remained unchanged, and Lu Bingsheng began to fall behind. Jin Zhongkang had moved up to fourth place, behind Wang. At this point, the situation had become a four-way battle between China and England. At 6,400 meters, Wang Zhenglin surged ahead of Lu Bingsheng and was about to compete with Kenner Tai. However, in the final 3,000 meters, although Wang surpassed Lu Bingsheng, his distance from Kenner Tai continued to widen. At 8,000 meters, Ken was already 50 meters ahead of Wang, while Wang was 100 meters ahead of Lu Bingsheng, and Jin Zhongkang was another 200 meters behind. Wang's speed could not increase, and it became impossible to surpass Ken. Lu Bingsheng had once caught up and ran alongside Wang in the final 1,000 meters, but soon fell behind. By the time Ken reached the finish line, Wang was still 250 meters away. Although Wang did not chase after him, he still gave his final sprint to the end, which was met with applause from the entire stadium. Lu Bingsheng finished third, about ten yards behind Wang, and Jin Zhongkang finished fourth, another 100 meters behind. Although the other athletes were not selected, they all reached the finish line one by one. Kenner Tai maintained the same speed throughout and his expression did not change. His time of 34 minutes and 49.5 seconds was rare here and had to be praised. Wang's failure was clearly due to a lack of physical strength.</p>

<p>High Hurdles: Xiao and Chen Suffer a Crushing Defeat - Chen Ling had set a national record of 16.4 seconds in the Chinese preliminary round. It was unexpectedly hoped that he would steadily win first place in this international competition. However, it was not known that there was a person named Waller in the English team, who had won the 100-meter championship with a time of 11.2 seconds. His time in the high hurdles preliminary round was also 16.4 seconds, preventing Chen Ling from having the sole honor of setting the record. However, it was expected that Chen Ling would compete with Waller for the win, but Waller took the lead and Xiao Dinghua followed closely behind, while Chen Ling was in third place, fighting to the end. The order remained the same, with Xiao finishing second by a step. Upon investigation, Xiao and Chen are famous high hurdles athletes in our country, and their defeat by the English team was unexpected.</p>

<p>In the world of our nation, how could the athletes of England, America, and the British territories compete with those of China? Only the Russian Kogoukov and the open group's Brook were worthy opponents. However, they were still no match for our team. When the starting gun fired, due to the difference in distance, it was difficult to judge the situation. After the first turn, Chen Ling flew like a celestial horse, crossing the hurdles with ease, taking the lead and going straight to the end, winning the championship with a time of 60.5 seconds, earning applause from the entire stadium. The second place was Tao Yingjie, about ten meters behind. The third was the Russian Kogoukov, and the fourth was Brook from the open group. Since the fourth place belonged to the open group, Guo, although ranked fifth, was still counted as fourth in terms of points.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Relay Competition <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>1,600 Meters: China Takes Third - Relay competitions are not our country's forte. After failing in the 400 meters on the first day, we were completely defeated yesterday, and in the 1,600 meters, China even fell to third place. Relying on the average talent and outstanding performance of its athletes, the English team's feet moved like spinning wheels, leading all the way and winning the championship with great ease. The United States came in second, 25 meters behind, and China was third, 30 meters away from the United States. The participating countries, rankings, and athletes are as follows:</p>
<p>First: England Eckel, Spall, Smith, Besant</p>
<p>Second: United States Schaden, Brown, Smith, Breckenridge</p>
<p>Fourth: China Dong Jiaxie, Wu Zhaochu, He Debao, Zeng Rongzhong</p>
<p>Fifth: Japan Inouye, Ling, Mu, Hirota, Tanaka</p>
<p>800 Meters: China Fails Again - By the time the 800-meter relay was held, all the other events had concluded. At that time, the scores for China and England were 75 to 73, with China holding a two-point advantage. Therefore, the key to victory hinged entirely on the relay. Whoever won the relay would win the overall championship of the tournament. The Mayor's Cup was almost like a prize given to the winner of that relay. China put up its best team to fight for the final victory. Five countries were lined up to compete. China's Hao Chunde was in the first leg and had a good start, but after the baton exchange, England suddenly surged ahead. From then on, China and England chased each other like a cat chasing a mouse. England remained consistent throughout and was not overtaken by China. As a result, England won the championship again, adding ten points and winning by two points with a score of 83 to 81,夺得大会之总锦标, taking the overall championship of the tournament. China only scored six points for second place, which was two points less than England, and thus the championship was lost. It was a pity. The lineups for the two countries are as follows:</p>
<p>England: Horace, Eckel, Hurst, Waller</p>
<p>China: Hao Chunde, Zheng Wen, Wang Jihuai, Fu Jincheng</p>
<h3 id="e106">100 Meter Dispute <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Forgiving English Athletes Unfamiliar with the Rules</p>
<p>A dispute arose during the first event of yesterday's opening ceremony, the 100-meter final. The reason was that the English athletes seemed to lack training in the starting procedure. After the starter called "On your marks" and "Set," they did not wait for the two-minute interval and rushed forward after the "Set" command. The starter followed the rules and judged it as a false start. According to the rules, two false starts would result in disqualification. The English athletes, Waller and Hochter, both had two false starts in a row. The starter followed the rules and disqualified them, but the English athletes, unfamiliar with the rules, refused to obey and argued forcefully, refusing to accept the judgment. After much debate, the chief referee made concessions and allowed them to participate, counting the two false starts as only one, on the grounds that they were unfamiliar with the rules and deserved forgiveness. However, it was stated that this would be strictly enforced from then on and no exceptions would be made. The matter was thus resolved by skirting around the issue.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Award Ceremony and Closing Ceremony <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu and Commander Dai Deliver Speeches | Shen Siliang Reports on the Competition Ending at 5:30 PM - The awards were originally given out after each event, but the team championship could only be decided after the competition ended. The result was a victory for England. By then, it was already dusk. Commander Dai Ji and Mayor Wu gave out the awards separately. Commander Dai presented the grand silver shield for the highest individual score (from left to right) to Wu Tiecheng, Dai Ji, Mrs. Guo Dehua, Guo Dehua, and Qian Hongjun (photo by Li Zunyong).</p>
<p>Dai personally awarded the grand silver shield for the highest individual score to Chen Ling of China. Another silver cup for the team championship was awarded to the English team. The Mayor's Cup was also awarded to the English team, and Mayor Wu personally presented it to the English team captain, Eckel. After the awards ceremony, Mayor Wu and Commander Dai delivered concise and insightful speeches. Shen Siliang reported on the conference, which concluded in the glow of ten thousand lights. The speeches are as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech - Mayor Wu delivered his speech in Mandarin, which was translated by Secretary-General Yu Hongjun. He said that the results of this year's Third Shanghai International Games were excellent and gratifying. Shanghai was able to host the International Games because it had international relations and needed to utilize international sports to promote goodwill among nations. It was not merely about winning first or second place, but about making progress year after year. He hoped that the results of the Fourth Games next year would be even better.</p>
<p>Commander Dai's Speech - I am honored to have participated in the grand event over the past two days. Everyone knows that sports are related to individuals, groups, and the country. Shanghai is a major trading port, and this conference can greatly enhance international goodwill. I hope that the results of next year's conference will be even better, and I wish you all good health.</p>

<p>Increased Audience - Yesterday's events were all finals, so attendance was very high.

Dr. Fang Jiacheng, the venue doctor, arrived on time to provide medical care.</p>
<p>Tug-of-War Performance - At 4:00 PM, there was a special program, a tug-of-war performance by the Western police of the Public Concession. Each team had eight people and a commander. After the referee mobilized the teams, the commanders assessed the situation, shouting slogans to concentrate their strength. The method was excellent. As a result, Team A won two consecutive victories, earning cheers from the entire stadium.</p>

<p>Four Things Worth Commemorating</p>
<p>- The Next Games Will Be Held in Taiyuan, with Qingdao as a Backup</p>
<p>Hao Gengsheng, Executive Committee Member of the North China Sports Federation and Director of Physical Education at Qingdao University, served as the chief referee in this North China Games. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday and will travel to Beijing today or tomorrow to attend a meeting of the Ministry of Education's Sports Committee. He discussed the successful state of this North China Games as follows: Hao said that this North China Games was generally very successful, and the results were excellent, breaking several national records. There were four things worth commemorating: (1) The North China Sports Federation did not stop working due to the national crisis; (2) The political leaders of North China have a deep understanding of sports; (3) In this North China Games, each province and city had ten representatives performing traditional Chinese martial arts, which did not conflict with other competitions, and can be said to have integrated Chinese and Western sports, taking the first step in implementing the resolutions of the National Sports Conference; (4) The athletes' spirit of compliance with the law is commendable. Even though Mr. Zhang Boling could not serve as the chief referee due to domestic affairs, they did not dispute the outcome and valued the spirit of rules and regulations. If this sporting spirit is promoted and expanded, it will not only be a good phenomenon in the Chinese sports world, but also an unparalleled good phenomenon for the Chinese nation. The next Games will be held in Taiyuan, accepting the invitation of the Shanxi representatives. However, Taiyuan needs to build a new stadium, and it is unknown whether the provincial government can accept it. An answer should be received within a month. Otherwise, the Games will be moved to Qingdao. As for the rumors of the Games being held in Peiping (Beijing), there is no such thing.</p>

<p>Postal Workers' Anti-Japanese Martyrs</p>
<p>Memorial Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Held at the Youth Propaganda Corps in the Morning</p>
<p>More Than 600 Representatives from All Walks of Life Attended</p>
<p>The National Postal Workers' General Union held a memorial service for the anti-Japanese martyrs of postal workers from all over the country at the Youth Propaganda Corps in Xiaoximen at 9:00 am yesterday. More than 600 representatives from the Central Party Headquarters and various agencies and groups in the city attended. The atmosphere was extremely tragic and solemn. Venue Arrangement: A decorated archway was erected at the entrance of the venue, with a white cloth banner in the middle that read "Memorial Service for Anti-Japanese Martyrs of Postal Workers from All Over the Country." The couplets on both sides read, "Righteousness Reaches the Clouds, Eternal Fame Manifests Loyalty," and "Spirit Devours the Mountains and Seas, A Thousand Autumns of Postal History Comfort the Loyal Souls." Wreaths of mourning flowers were everywhere. On the stage hung the words "Sacrifice for the Public," and in the center were the portraits of the anti-Japanese martyrs Pan Jiaji, Lu Chunhua, Chen Zude, and the martyrs Chen Fangxiang, Fu Xiude, Feng Wancang, Su Pincai, Ti Jiachen, and others. The portrait of the National Revolutionary Leader and the Party and National Flags were hung on the platform. To the west of the stage were the relatives of the martyrs. The entire venue was decorated in a very solemn and tragic manner. The Municipal Public Security Bureau specially dispatched a squad of armed police officers from the First Squad of the Fifth Detachment of the Police Brigade, led by Detachment Leader Wang Shaozhou, to be on strict guard around the venue. Director Tang of the Second District Branch sent Inspector Wang to lead the police to protect the venue. The Postal Workers' Boy Scouts, led by Coach Shen Fu, maintained order at the meeting.</p>
<p>Participating Representatives: Wang Qi from the Central Party Headquarters, Wang Diwen from the Central Mass Movement Committee, Zhang Xiaotong from the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, Chen Junyi from the Municipal Government, Xie Baochen from the Directorate General of Posts, Postal Director Zha Peilin, Wang Songwu from the Postal Administration, Bao Sheng and Wang Youhui from the Garrison Headquarters, Xu Dehai from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Li Yongxiang from the General Labor Union, Sun Mingqi from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Yichen from the Citizens' Union, Wang Honghui from the All-Road Merchants' Association, Zhu Jikuan and Zhu Shengsheng from the National Postal Workers' General Union, Hu Xiongding from Jiaotong University, and Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, Long Peiyun, Ye Xianggao, Li Mengnan from various labor unions, as well as Su Pincai, Chen Fangxiang, Cheng Long, Zhuang Jiliang, Wang Xingfa, and Northeast postal worker Li Weixin and other relatives of the deceased, totaling more than 600 people. When guests entered the venue, they were adorned with a yellow silk flower and a piece of black gauze by receptionists. (Photos taken by Wang Kai Photo Studio)</p>
<p>Memorial Ceremony: The meeting was announced at 10:00 am, and the ceremony was as follows: (1) Playing of mourning music; (2) All stand at attention; (3) Singing of the Party song; (4) Bowing three times to the Party and National Flags and the portrait of the National Revolutionary Leader; (5) Bowing three times to the portraits of the martyrs; (6) Reading the National Revolutionary Leader's will; (7) Ringing the alarm bell thirty-six times; (8) Silent tribute for three minutes to mourn the martyrs; (9) Chief officiant Lu Jingshi, assistant officiants Zhu Xuefan and Zhang Kechang, took their positions and performed the sacrificial rites; (10) Offering wreaths; (11) Reading the memorial text, Zhao Shusheng; (12) Representatives from the Central Government and various agencies and groups in the city offered sacrifices, followed by speeches from the chairman and representatives. Finally, slogans were shouted and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Chief Officiant's Speech: Chief Officiant Lu Jingshi delivered a speech, saying that the union held the memorial service to give condolences to the postal martyrs from all over the country, and expressed gratitude for the presence of the delegates from the Central Government, and from all organizations from all walks of life. These eight martyrs were ordinary workers, but they knew the national crisis and sacrificed everything for the country. This is worthy of commemoration, and it adds a glorious page to our history of postal workers' resistance against Japan. It also adds a glorious record to the history of the postal workers' movement. But when we look back at the current situation in our country, we are filled with sorrow. Those soldiers who are supported by the people do not know how to defend against foreign enemies, but specialize in civil wars. All we see is the melee of the warlords, such as Lu Zhonghan Liu, and the two Lius in Sichuan. How do these warlords, who do not know the country but only know how to fight for power, compare with our martyred postal workers? Therefore, if we want to save the country, we must first overthrow the warlords. His speech was extremely sad and painful. Then, Zhu Xuefan, the captain of the Postal Workers' War Zone Ambulance Team, reported on the martyrs' life stories and the tragic circumstances of their martyrdom, which moved people to tears. Subsequently, Wang Qi, the representative of the Central Government, Zhang Xiaotong, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Li Yongxiang, the representative of the General Labor Union, delivered speeches, which were mostly sad and painful. Due to the length of the speeches, they are omitted.</p>
<p>Memorial Text of the General Assembly: On October 16, the 21st year of the Republic of China, the National Postal Workers' General Union, respectfully led all postal workers, with the ceremony of incense, flowers, and purity, to offer sacrifices to the anti-Japanese martyred comrades, Martyr Chen Zude, Martyr Pan Jiaji, Martyr Chen Chunhua, Martyr Chen Fangxiang, Martyr Su Pincai, Martyr Yang Jiachen, Martyr Fu Xiude. The spirit of the words say, "We Chinese people, with etiquette and clothing, strong neighbors show violence, tigers watch and eagles fly, deep pain and great trauma, national shame can be forgotten, heaven has not repented of the disaster, the enemy atmosphere is rampant, the Northeast is lost, and we are deeply hesitant, the Songhu smoke of war, and the rise of panic, sheltering the martyrs, the style is upright, the spirit is vast, the party is outstanding, the country's good, or loyal to its duties, the ambition is pure and the behavior is fragrant, or encouraging the Rong, regardless of the length, with the same hatred for the enemy, swearing to drive away tigers and wolves, boiling blood and sincerity, enduring hardships, guns and bullets, my power is increasing, wolf smoke and fire, my martial arts are increasing, hair is split, anger devours the eight wildernesses, the same way leads to the same goal, in order to plan for relief, alas, how can we expect bad news to fly, all for the country's death, hate the throat of the river, ambition, draw straw to mourn, assign the soul to be sad, offer the spirit of the sword, mourn the vastness of the spring, may the martyrs, beautiful for the sun and the moon, the doctrine is glorious, as bright as stars, showing the constitution, the heroic soul and spirit, should be passed down for thousands of years, the high mountains are steep, the flowing water is soup, the style of the martyrs, the mountains are high and the water is long, alas, alas, Shangxiang,"</p>
<p>Family Response: After the representatives finished their speeches, Pan Gan, the representative of the martyrs' families, gave a reply. He said that the martyrdom of the martyrs in resisting the enemy was a common occurrence. In this autumn of national crisis, all citizens should rise up to resist foreign enemies and sacrifice their lives for the country, which is the inherent duty of citizens. This was the aspiration of the martyrs during their lifetime. Today, we are honored by the presence of various agencies and groups to hold a memorial service, and we are grateful for the presence of guests from all walks of life. We dare not accept such kindness. After reading the extremely tragic sentences and listening to the extremely earnest speeches, we know that the spirit of the martyrs can never die, and the righteous spirit of the martyrs can be passed down forever. The martyrs have spirits, and they will smile in heaven at this solemn and solemn meeting and the sincere and enthusiastic heroism. On behalf of the martyrs, I would like to express my gratitude.</p>
<p>Summary of Funeral Couplets: (1) Chiang Kai-shek "Heroic spirit permeates the universe, bravely resisting foreign invaders, spring flowers bury the chivalrous bones," "Loyal heart penetrates the stars, becoming benevolent and sacrificing the country, autumn water mourns the loyal souls." (2) Huang Shaoxiong "Becoming benevolent in the anti-Japanese war, adding glory to the history of the postal service," "Not being unfaithful in the face of disaster, showing the fearless spirit of the nation."

<p>Someone suggested to the Abolish War Association</p>
<p>Casting iron statues of those who engage in civil war</p>
<p>Select important places in the city to erect them</p>
<p>The General Assembly of the Abolish Civil War League received a letter from He Jixiang of the First Municipal Experimental Primary School yesterday, which said, "To open with respect, abolishing civil war is the unanimous desire of the people of the whole country today, and it is also a prerequisite for us to open up a national lifeline today. How can we achieve the goal of abolishing civil war? What effective methods can be used to effectively stop the warlords' civil war? This is a major issue at present. When your association was established, it formulated many plans and announced them to the people of the country. After your association started to discuss the plans to abolish civil war, there were many different opinions. However, in reality, most of them were just empty talk on paper. How many of them can achieve practical results? When the Second Chen dispute in Guangdong arose, did your association not send telegrams and dispatch representatives to Guangdong to persuade both sides? But where is its real effect? Now the Han Liu dispute in Shandong has arisen again, and your association has once again persuaded, but the dispute remains the same. Recently, it was reported that Mao Wang in Qianzhong is about to meet with swords and soldiers. I guess your association will only persuade once again. In addition, what further sanctions will be taken is beyond the reach of your association. This is not to blame your association, because what your association can show to the people of the country today is only empty appeals. Fundamentally, there is no real power that can slightly curb the ambition of those warlords who are addicted to war. We are firm and discuss it. If we want to thoroughly eliminate the warlords today, there is no other way than revolution. The second is the method of passive non-cooperation, which can also slightly kill the warlords' arrogance. However, with the strength and organization of the people today, this level is also difficult to achieve. Therefore, today, if we want to talk emptily about abolishing civil war, without fundamentally seeking a solution, no matter what kind of strategy, we can only return to failure and will never achieve the slightest effect. The past events are clear, and they can be used as a clear proof. However, there is only one thing that is worthy of our efforts. What is that? It is to cast iron statues of those who engage in civil war in order to expose their ugliness. The idea of casting statues has a long history. When Qi caused disaster to Su, Shanghai once proposed to cast statues for them, but it was not actually implemented. However, it has attracted much attention, which shows its profound impact. I believe that in the future, those who engage in civil war, no matter who they are, will not ask who is right and who is wrong. Your association will first persuade them, and if they do not listen to the persuasion, you will cast several iron statues for both sides and explain the reasons for casting the statues. The cast statues will be erected in important places in the city to be唾罵 by all and to bear a bad name forever. Shanghai is the largest metropolis in our country. What it sees and hears will inevitably affect the whole country. Those evil warlords, although they are arrogant and invincible, if they have a little conscience, they will inevitably feel ashamed when they see this, and they will learn from the past to avoid future mistakes. Although this matter is small, its effect is great. Therefore, I would like to present it to your association, and I respectfully ask you to adopt it."</p>
<p>Xiong Xiling and others suggested</p>
<p>Transfer party fees to help the righteous army</p>
<p>Telegram to the National Government and the Central Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Xiong Xiling and others, the executive directors of the Shanghai National Salvation Organizations Joint Association, telegraphed to the Nanjing National Government and the Central Party Headquarters yesterday, saying: "To the Nanjing National Government and the Central Party Headquarters, the Northeast has been lost for a year in an instant. People are plotting against us, and the disasters are not limited to the three provinces. The disasters are coming, and they are progressing with the times. Thinking of the future, how can we not be vigilant? The League of Nations Charter is invalid, and the investigation suggestions are even more dangerous. Foreign aid is so unreliable. To restore the lost territory and wash away our national shame, there is no hope other than to fight the enemy with iron blood. In the past, the loss of Black Soil and the Battle of Shanghai were enough to make the strong enemy lose courage. Today, our Northeast Volunteer Army has risen one after another. Under the oppression of the enemy's iron hooves, the banner of righteousness points to the flag, and the thieves and captives are defeated. The news of chasing the defeated and pursuing the north is repeated. It is enough to know that the skills of the Japanese slaves are nothing more than donkeys in Guizhou. If our Volunteer Army has sufficient support, it is not difficult to sweep away the enemy's atmosphere. There is no perfect egg in a overturned nest, and it is impossible to refuse to cross the river in the same boat. The only need of the Righteous Army today is in the military. And in the blink of an eye, it is winter, and the north is bitterly cold. It is difficult to fight with a frozen body against a solid armor and sharp weapons. Alas, my compatriots, how can we bear this? At this moment, patriotic people are not not recruiting donations and trying to provide relief. However, the people's strength is weak, and the years of natural disasters and man-made disasters are not enough to save the dead. Even if there is something to be gained, it is just a drop in the bucket. It is hoped that the government and the party headquarters will, in addition to their concern for national disasters, carefully plan for the salary, weapons, medicine, clothing, and other military supplies of the Northeast Volunteer Army, and provide as much direct and indirect relief as possible. If the financial resources are exhausted and the Secretary of Agriculture is looking up at the roof, it is just as well to temporarily stop the Party Affairs expenses of the national treasury and transfer all of them to military use. The Party survives and the country survives, and the country dies and the Party dies. Saving the Party must first save the country, and saving the country is saving the Party.

<h3 id="e115">Wang Jingwei Decided <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>To Go to Europe for Medical Treatment in a Few Days</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang Decided to Go with Him</p>
<p>Zeng Zhongming Did Not Go Due to Business</p>
<p>Gu Mengyu Went to Hangzhou Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the news that Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei was going to Europe for medical treatment was confirmed by many parties yesterday. President Wang decided to go abroad in three to five days, and Mrs. Wang Chen Bijun also decided to go with him. Zeng Zhongming was unable to go with him due to business. Wang is scheduled to return to China within the leave approved by the Central Government. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Gu and Zeng Arrived in Shanghai: Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu and Deputy Minister Zeng Zhongming arrived in Shanghai at about 8:00 am yesterday by night train from Beijing. After getting off the train, Zeng went directly to Wang's residence on Xipushi Road to rest, and then went out. Gu went to Wang's residence with his wife at about 10:00 am and met with Mrs. Wang Chen Bijun and had a long conversation. He left at about 11:00 am and hired a car to go to Hangzhou for sightseeing via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Zeng went to Knoll Hospital in the afternoon to meet with Wang to discuss the issue of going abroad for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Zeng's Talk: A Central News Agency reporter met Zeng Zhongming at the North Station yesterday morning and had the following conversation: (Question) Is it true that President Wang will go to Europe for medical treatment? (Answer) President Wang is suffering from a serious illness and does intend to go to Europe for medical treatment, but it has not been completely determined at present. (Question) Will Mrs. Wang and Deputy Minister Zeng go with him? (Answer) It has not been decided yet. (Question) What is the purpose of Deputy Minister Zeng's visit? (Answer) I came here to meet with President Wang to discuss the issue of going abroad for medical treatment. (Question) When will Deputy Minister Zeng return to Beijing? (Answer) I am scheduled to return to Beijing by night train tomorrow (that is, today). After the conversation, Zeng hurried into the car and left. Later, a Central News Agency reporter visited Zeng at Wang's residence in the evening and asked about the results of the meeting with President Wang. According to Zeng, Wang decided to go to Europe for medical treatment within the three-month leave approved by the Central Government in order to seek complete recovery as soon as possible and to be able to recuperate quietly. Although the date of departure has not been determined, it is expected that it will be possible within three to five days, because the three-month leave is very short, and if it is delayed further, he may not be able to return to China on schedule. Which country to go to has not been decided yet. However, Mrs. Wang Chen Bijun has decided to accompany him to take care of him. I am unable to leave my post and go with him due to busy official duties. As for Wang's opinion on the investigation team's report, Zeng said that it is not yet time to make a public statement. The report that Wang will convene a meeting in Shanghai before his departure is just speculation. He may exchange opinions with important figures in Shanghai.</p>
<p>News from the Chu Residence: Yesterday, the wife of Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chu Minyi told a Central News Agency reporter that Wang's tropical disease has now recovered slightly, but he still needs to change places to recuperate. Therefore, Wang has decided to go abroad for medical treatment. Whether he will go to Germany and when he will leave has not been determined. Mrs. Wang Chen Bijun may go with him, because according to Dr. Knoll, he hopes that Mrs. Wang will go with him, which will be more convenient. Whether Railway Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming will go abroad with Wang has not been decided yet.</p>
<p>Wang Has Not Been Discharged from the Hospital: Yesterday, it was reported that Wang had been discharged from Knoll Hospital and returned to his private residence on Xipushi Road. According to a deep visit by reporters to Knoll Hospital, Wang was still recuperating in the hospital yesterday. The rumor that he had been discharged from the hospital and returned to his residence was completely inaccurate. According to a Knoll doctor who spoke to a Western newspaper reporter yesterday, Wang is still recuperating in the hospital.</p>
<p>Gu's Visit to Hangzhou: Yesterday afternoon, a Central News Agency reporter visited Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu at his residence.</p>

<p>According to his family, Gu took his wife and son by car to Hangzhou via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway in the morning to visit and inspect the construction of the road. Gu will visit Hangzhou for a few days before returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e116">National Salvation Organizations Joint Association <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Telegrams Overseas Chinese to Help the Righteous Army</p>
<p>The National Salvation Organizations Joint Association of the city, as the winter season is approaching, the green gauze tent has been removed, and the Northeast Volunteer Army has lost its reliance and is suffering from hunger and cold, telegraphed to overseas Chinese to provide assistance. The original telegram said, "Since the Northeast was lost, a year has passed in an instant. People are plotting against us, and they are getting an inch and a foot. The disasters are not only for the compatriots in the three provinces, but also for the people in the deep waters. Recently, the investigation team's report has been released. Looking at its suggestions, the sovereignty of China is in name only. It is known that the League of Nations attaches importance to power and ignores justice. If we want to survive, we must be self-reliant. To restore the lost territory and wash away our national shame, we only need iron and blood. Our Northeast Volunteer Army has risen one after another under the trampling of the strong enemy's iron hooves. Wherever the voice of righteousness is broadcast, the thieves and captives are defeated. Jinxi has repeatedly asked for help, and Shenyang has been besieged again. The reason why they have not been able to drive the enemy out of the country is that they have not received sufficient supplies. It is enough to know. When the green gauze tent is removed and the cover is completely lost, and the winter season is approaching, there is a lack of clothing and food. The northeast is bitterly cold, even in normal times, there is still a fear of freezing. The enemy's aid is increasing day by day, and a big battle is imminent. If there is not enough assistance, alas, my righteous army will not be defeated by the enemy's artillery fire and aircraft, and will also die from hunger and cold. Thinking of this, the heart is painful. The country has been suffering from disasters and famines for years, and the soldiers and bandits are suffering from them. The people are exhausted and poor, and they cannot afford to live. The government is sitting and misunderstanding the opportunity, and they are unable to make any progress. The people are talking emptily about saving the country, and they are only groaning. The wind and rain are drifting, and the boat is few. It is really the autumn of survival and death, and we have to cry out to our overseas compatriots. We hope that you will be passionate about protecting the motherland, and that you will be saddened by the disasters of the three provinces. We hope that you will rush to the aid of the needy and donate generously. In the future, when the Japanese prisoners are swept away and the skin work is achieved, it will be the strength of all of you, and the people of the whole country will have the glory to implement it. Urgent statement, I hope you will pay attention. Xiong Xiling, Chu Fucheng, Niu Chuanshan, Li Cishan, Wang Boshu, Liu Shixiong, Chen Dingyuan, Ni Guanghe, Wang Yiping, executive directors of the National Salvation Organizations Joint Association of the Republic of China, kowtow."</p>
<h3 id="e117">Northeast Volunteer Army Air Force Sends Personnel to Europe <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Our people, in view of the crisis in the Northeast, are more aware that it is not enough to provide our Volunteer Army with sufficient material and spiritual supplies to boost their morale, recover the lost land, and return our rivers and mountains. Moreover, although the morale and momentum of our 19th Route Army in Shanghai to resist Japan was brave, it ultimately felt that it was difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. When enemy planes came to attack, there was no way to stop them, and they were allowed to drop bombs, burn, and slaughter. This is what our people are most distressed about. At present, the people are automatically engaging in long-term anti-Japanese national salvation, so they plan to catch up quickly, collect money to purchase aircraft, and gather combat-trained talents. Once Guangxi flying coach Huang Yuanbo and Hunan pilot Li Binghui and other aircraft arrive in Shanghai, they will fly to the front to carry out national salvation work. In addition, Zhu Jiqing, the commander-in-chief of the Northeast Volunteer Army, directly appointed Xiao Buyun, the former director of Hunan Aviation and the anti-Japanese pilot of the 19th Route Army, as the commander of the Northeast Volunteer Army Air Force, and immediately sent him to Europe and North and South America to promote aviation to save the country to overseas Chinese, raise funds to purchase aircraft, save our Northeast, and recover the lost land. Xiao, whose name is Shaoshi, is from Xinhui. He is honest and generous. Six years ago, when he was interning in combat flying in the United States, he also served as the general manager of the Chinese Public Association in New York and other major ports. Therefore, overseas Chinese in the United States believe in his personality especially urgently. This time, the people's recommendation of Xiao to go to Europe and the United States to purchase aircraft and raise funds will be very effective. It is heard that the funds donated will be used entirely to expand the air force army for long-term national salvation.</p>
<h3 id="e118">News from the Righteous Army Ambulance Team Yesterday <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Northeast Volunteer Army Ambulance Team, many patriotic youths from all over the country have come to the team to request to join. However, the team's goal is to provide ambulance, so those who do not have considerable medical and military knowledge will not be accepted. According to Jiang Huan, the deputy captain of the team, dozens of people have come to the team every day to request to join, which shows the general public sentiment. As for soliciting shares and contacting various business groups for supplies, the results are still good. However, the departure expenses are particularly difficult. Because of the days of soliciting donations from the outside world, the amount obtained is still small, which inevitably affects the departure date. However, within one or two weeks at the latest, the first batch of team members will definitely find a way to depart. The number of people is around 50, so that the wounded Righteous Army can get ambulance as soon as possible. They are currently rushing to complete the departure procedures. Also, the donations raised by the former Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Secondary School Students amounted to nearly 10,000. In addition to assisting General Ma Zhanshan, there are still remaining funds, which are currently deposited in a bank in the city. Yesterday afternoon, the Secondary School Federation convened a meeting of various schools to discuss the disposal of the funds, and notified the Northeast Volunteer Army Ambulance Team to send personnel to report on the organizational significance and current situation, so that the funds could be allocated for assistance. The discussion resulted in a portion being directly remitted to the Northeast to assist the Northeast Volunteer Army, and a portion being allocated to the Righteous Army Ambulance Team for departure expenses. However, because the number of people who arrived yesterday was insufficient, it was not convenient to vote immediately. Another meeting will be convened this week to decide.</p>

<p>The gentlemen of the medical community at sea deeply mourn the fact that the military and civilians of the Northeast have been brutally robbed, and they are all indignant. They have sacrificed everything and automatically collected money to organize the Northeast Military and Civilian Dare-to-Die Ambulance Team. The temporary office is located at No. 5, Aishou Lane, Meibaige Road, near the Racecourse. They have prepared medicines and supplies, and will depart as soon as the ambulance personnel are formed. The Northeast ambulance work has also appointed Wang Tiecheng as the captain of the team, Wan Baocui as the director of the ambulance department, Huang Yishi as the director of the general affairs department, and Ye Dabing as the director of the transportation department. Other staff members, both men and women, are welcome. If people from all walks of life are happy to provide material assistance, they will be very grateful.</p>

<p>Residents' Representatives from the Designated Area of the New North Station Site Petition Again</p>
<p>Because the Ministry's Telegram Added Over a Thousand Mu of Land</p>
<p>The Pengpu Municipal Committee Promised to Forward It for Review</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways, for the construction of the new North Station, has included the Pengpu and Zhenru districts within the railway construction zone. Because the designated area was excessive, residents from Wangjiajing, Zhangjiazai, Zhuxiang, and other places in the Pengpu district previously organized a petition group to appeal to the Ministry of Railways, requesting a reduction in the land requisitioned to alleviate the people's hardship. The Ministry of Railways replied that the currently designated land was not yet final and was subject to change in the future. However, recently, Railway Minister Gu Mengyu telegraphed Shanghai Mayor Wu, stating that for the new station, it was necessary to purchase additional land within a range of approximately 1,000 meters north of Jiaotong Road, west of Zhongshan Road, and about 680 meters long from east to west. This has affected the villages of Zhaojiazai and Lujiazai.</p>
<p>The residents in the vicinity are perplexed as to why the Ministry of Railways needs to include such a vast area. Therefore, over a hundred households from these two villages each sent a representative to form a petition group, which merged with the existing petition group from Wangjiajing and the other three villages, totaling over five hundred households. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, each household sent a representative, totaling over five hundred people, who first went to the Pengpu Municipal Committee Office to petition. Committee member Ling Zhibin personally received them. The representatives elected Zhao Chubei and Zhao Youting to speak, stating that the Ministry of Railways only needed 700 mu of land for railway construction, but the Railway Bureau had designated over 4,000 mu. Now, even 4,000 mu is not enough, and they are expanding it by another thousand mu. They are unsure what the Ministry's intention is. They have heard rumors that the Ministry intends to buy the designated area and then sell it at a high price, which may not be without reason. Therefore, they requested a prompt solution to alleviate their situation.</p>
<p>Committee member Ling replied that he would forward the petition to the municipal government for review. The petition representatives dispersed at 2:00 PM. It is also reported that the municipal committees of the four districts of Jiangwan, Yinhang, Zhenru, and Pengpu previously received orders from the municipal government to prohibit the sale of land within the area designated by the Ministry of Railways in the four districts, as the land prices needed to be determined after a three-week investigation. Now that February has arrived, far exceeding the three-week period, and the municipal government has not yet issued a decision, the four district committees intend to petition the municipal government to issue an order quickly. They are currently drafting the petition.</p>

<p>Reporting on Returning Home to Attend to His Father's Illness</p>
<p>Chairman Xu Shiying of the Central Relief Committee was permitted to return to his ancestral home in Qiupu on the 16th night on the Jiangxin ship to attend to his seriously ill father, Mr. Yutang. He had telegraphed the Executive Yuan on a cold day, requesting a leave of absence for twenty days. The original text of his telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is copied below:</p>
<p>"To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Hankou, having received the telegram on the 30th, I replied with due respect. Shiying complied and went to Shanghai, where I repeatedly consulted with people from all walks of life in Shanghai and resolved to establish the Provisional Joint Relief Association for the Disaster Areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. The executive and supervisory committee members have been appointed and have begun their work. As a relief official, Shiying should follow the lead of all sectors of society and strive to raise funds to fulfill your compassionate intention for the disaster victims. I recently received a telegram stating that my father is seriously ill with leg and abdominal swelling and reduced appetite. Shiying will return to his ancestral home in Qiupu immediately to serve him. All responsible duties, as well as matters related to disaster relief in the Northeast and Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, have been entrusted to the standing committee members. In addition to requesting a twenty-day leave from the Executive Yuan, I respectfully report this matter. Respectfully, Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Committee."</p>

The store staff opened the letter, and while they were passing it around, a bomb suddenly exploded outside the store's display window facing Guangdong Road. People in the store scrambled for safety, but because the bomb's force was weak, only a section of the glass was shattered, with no other damage. The store immediately reported the incident to the Lao Zha Gate police station, which dispatched a detective to investigate and took the bomb fragments and letter back to the police station for filing.</p>

Yesterday, County Magistrate Yan issued instructions to all public security sub-bureau chiefs along the river to investigate at any time and issued a notice to the public along the river prohibiting arbitrary occupation of public rivers. Those who dare to deliberately violate the rules will be prosecuted.</p>

<p>The Body Was Transported to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Temporarily Placed in the International Funeral Home</p>
<p>The Encoffining Ceremony Will Be Held on the 19th Before Returning to His Hometown for Burial</p>
<p>Hu Hongji, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, was traveling by car from Shanghai to Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway the day before yesterday afternoon when the car overturned near Haiyan Station, resulting in a tragic accident. Mr. Hu suffered severe injuries and died after some time. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, Mayor Wu's wife and Municipal Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and others personally went to Mr. Hu's residence to offer condolences. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Body Was Transported to Shanghai</p>
<p>After hearing the news, Mrs. Hu, accompanied by Shen Hao, the head of the First Section of the Municipal Health Bureau, Wu Liguo, the head of the Second Section, and Sun Jiazhai, a medical technician from the bureau, traveled to Haiyan by three cars and one ambulance yesterday morning at 6:00 AM. They transported Mr. Hu's body to Shanghai by ambulance, arriving at the International Funeral Home at 4:30 PM in the afternoon, where it will be temporarily placed. The encoffining ceremony is scheduled for the 19th, after which the body will be transported back to his hometown in Wuxi for burial. A portrait of Hu Hongji is included.</p>
<p>Details of the Accident</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper went to Mr. Hu's residence to investigate the details of the accident. According to reports, at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, Mr. Hu, accompanied by Mr. Gereke, the Director of Medical Education of the American Health Association, and several Chinese friends, traveled by car from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway to Hangzhou for a visit. Mr. Hu and three Chinese friends were in one car, while Mr. Gereke and other Westerners were in another car in front. The car was originally driven by a chauffeur, but upon reaching Haiyan Station, Mr. Hu took over as the driver. Before driving two miles, the tragic accident occurred. It is said that in the car, in addition to Mr. Hu, who suffered severe injuries and died, only one person was slightly injured, and two were unharmed. It is reported that Mr. Hu was 40 years old and left behind five children, the eldest of whom is only 11 years old. His elder brother, Hu Songming, is engaged in commerce.</p>
<p>Many Visited to Offer Condolences</p>
<p>Yesterday, those who visited Mr. Hu's residence to offer condolences included Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Qun, Mayor Wu's wife, Huang Fu, Municipal Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Director of the Health Department Liu Ruiheng, and Director Jin Baoshan, who came to Shanghai from Nanjing specifically to offer condolences and assist in handling Mr. Hu's funeral and related matters.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Mr. Hu</p>
<p>Hu Hongji was from Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, and was 40 years old. In 1917, he graduated from the National Medical College of Peking. In 1924, he obtained a Doctor of Public Health degree from Johns Hopkins University in the United States. He served as the Deputy Director of the Shanghai-Songhu Commercial Port Health Bureau and has been the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau for six years.</p>
<p>A telegram from Hangzhou on the 16th stated that after Hu Hongji died in Haiyan on the 15th, the Provincial Highway Bureau sent Inspector Ye Jichun to care for Hu's wife, Zhou Wenzhu, on the 16th. At 10:00 AM on the 16th, accompanied by Shen Hao and Wu Liguo, heads of the Shanghai Health Bureau, they transported the body back to Shanghai. According to Wu Chongren, the Magistrate of Haiyan County, Hu's motive for coming to Hangzhou was to test drive a car at the invitation of Mr. Huili, the owner of the Huili Automobile Company. Those who suffered the accident together were Zhang Zukang, the owner of the Shanghai Zhang Chongxin Sauce Garden, Wu Lusheng, a former employee of the Shanghai Finance Bureau, and the driver. Wu Lusheng's injuries were also serious and was sent to Hangzhou Guangji Hospital on the morning of the 16th. Zhang Zukang and the driver suffered minor injuries. Hu was driving the car at the time of the accident.</p>
<p>After the Luoyang Great China Newspaper Was Shut Down</p>
<p>The Newspaper's President Will Come to Shanghai to Appeal</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Luoyang Great China Daily was shut down by Xie Qing, a member of the county party headquarters, and Huang Zhuangfei, the director of the Public Security Bureau. The newspaper has already sent representatives to Shanghai, and its president, Jia Xingyuan, will also come to Shanghai within days to appeal to the local press for assistance and petition the central government. The text of his appeal telegram to the central government is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Omitted titles) Greetings, Xie Qing, a member of the Luoyang County Party Headquarters, and Huang Zhuangfei, the director of the Public Security Bureau, abused their power for personal revenge and acted illegally. They falsely claimed that the Great China Daily's opinions were erroneous and slandered the central government. On October 5th, the Public Security Bureau used armed forces to arbitrarily shut down the Great China Daily and falsely issued orders to fabricate facts and arrest President Jia Xingyuan and Vice President Zhao Ziyun. We fear that various sectors will not understand the truth and will be misled. The truth is respectfully stated as follows:</p>
<p>The position of this newspaper is with the people. China has suffered greatly from years of war, bandits, floods, and droughts. The rural economy is bankrupt, commerce is declining, and the country is on the verge of collapse. The people are in dire straits. Taking advantage of our misfortunes, the violent Japanese are invading. The September 18th Incident occurred, and 30 million compatriots in the three northeastern provinces were brutally trampled upon. Thousands of miles of beautiful rivers and mountains are no longer ours. All those with blood and qi are furious and either die on the battlefield or strive in propaganda to fulfill their duties as citizens. However, in just over a year, the foreign troubles have become increasingly urgent, the people's dreams are still as before, and the corruption of officials is still as in the past. What should the people of our country feel? Moreover, the government moved to Luoyang, taking the development of the Northwest and the reform of internal affairs as urgent tasks. This newspaper was born in this environment, and its responsibilities and mission should be based on whether it is suitable for this trend. Therefore, since its publication, it has strived to publish and promote the sufferings of the local people and spared no effort to promote righteous development. Regarding the appeals of the people, the evil deeds of local bullies and corrupt officials, as well as arousing the people's patriotism and supervising the government's measures, we dare to speak frankly and not be tempted by profit or bent by power to fulfill the responsibilities of the press and hope to achieve the effect of completing the revolution and comfort the people's desires. In particular, when encountering news of the violent Japanese massacre and the corruption of our officials, we cannot help but hold the pen and raise our voices, lamenting the imminent destruction of the country and cutting off our own interests. Expressing anger is a natural trend. Moreover, the facts are all there, and the conscience is difficult to ignore. We dare not embellish, but the county party headquarters mistakenly took the opinions as erroneous and slandering the central government as an excuse without specifying evidence. The injustice of the three words "perhaps" reappears in Luoyang, the current capital. This is truly a cause for weeping bitterly. Xie Qing issued orders to the county, transferred the letter to the Public Security Bureau to seal up our company, and the Public Security Bureau even fabricated arrest warrants to arrest the president and vice president, etc. Upon investigation, Huang Zhuangfei, the director of the Luoyang Public Security Bureau, and Xie Qing of the Party Headquarters are from the same village. Since taking office, they have been fearless and have spared no effort to employ private individuals to accumulate wealth. For example, the Luoyang Narcotics Prohibition Office, after being banned, recognized red envelopes and reported taxable goods as illegal, setting up a bureau to extort no less than 4,000 taels of silver. They reported concealing, distributing spoils, and pocketing profits. The local government reported to the provincial government. Recently, a member of the bureau, Gao Tiezhi, dressed in a gray military uniform, repeatedly impersonated the name of the inspection office, using the search for narcotics as a pretext to extort fines. This newspaper reported the facts and did not comply with their request, which aroused the bureau's hatred. Moreover, Xie Qing, a member of the Luoyang County Party Headquarters, is of low moral character and colluded with the former and current directors of the Public Security Bureau to do evil together. Vice President Zhao Ziyun and others filed a complaint with the Provincial Party Headquarters to investigate, but Xie Qing, in order to vent his hatred on Zhao alone, even implicated the innocent, making a mountain out of a molehill. Arbitrarily destroying speech organs, insulting the personality of the press, and hating world justice, taking the tongue of the people as sinister and vicious, nothing is more so. If we do not severely punish them, how can we warn against corruption and rectify party discipline? We dare to reveal the beginning and end to the public. We hope that all sectors will rise up to help, support justice, and respect public opinion. The president of the Great China Daily and all the staff are waiting for orders with utmost urgency."</p>
<p>The China Construction Bank Is Changed to a Government-Supervised, Merchant-Run System</p>
<p>Capital of 10 Million Yuan Is Being Raised</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry previously planned to establish the China Construction Bank, specializing in industrial investment. It was originally a joint venture between government and merchants, but it has now been changed to a completely merchant-run system. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from industrial circles in Shanghai yesterday that although the China Construction Bank is completely merchant-run, the Ministry of Industry, as the initiator, still has the power to supervise and assist during the process. As for the share capital, negotiations are currently underway, with a total capital of 10 million yuan, and investments from Hong Kong merchants are expected to be the most significant.</p>
<p>The Fresh Pork Industry Calls a Representatives' Meeting to Protest the Pork Tax</p>
<p>Organize a Petition Group to Achieve Its Goals</p>
<p>Issue a Declaration Requesting Assistance from All Sectors</p>
<p>The fresh pork industry in Jiangsu Province is protesting the business tax on pigs. The business tax bureaus in Jiangbei, Jingjiang, Rugao, and Taixing counties have been renting civilian houses in various ports since September 21st to collect business tax on pigs passing through, at a rate of two jiao per pig. Industries across Jiangsu Province have risen up in opposition, repeatedly sending telegrams of protest and sending representatives to Shanghai to jointly discuss countermeasures to ensure consistency. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a special meeting of industry representatives from various counties was held in Nanshi. Over 60 representatives from various counties, including Cai Jinqing, Wang Shusheng, Chen Jinrong, Zhang Tongxing, and Wu Xishan, decided to organize a temporary joint association of fresh pork industry representatives from various counties in Jiangsu. Gu Xinyi, Cai Shusheng, Chen Jinrong, Qi Wenyao, and others were elected as the presidium to preside over the meeting as usual. The following resolutions were made:</p>
<p>1.  ) Representative Cai Xiqing proposed that the assembly organize a petition and prepare a document to petition the government authorities, not stopping until the goal is achieved. The proposal was adopted.</p>
<p>2.  ) Representative Wang Shusheng proposed that if the petition is ineffective, an appeal be filed with the Control Yuan in accordance with the law. The proposal was adopted.</p>
<p>3.  ) Representative Qi Wenyao proposed that our industry has been subjected to illegal oppression for a long time. Please organize a joint office of various industries as a permanent institution. The proposal was adopted.</p>
<p>4.  ) Representative Cai Xiqing proposed that the taxes that have been coerced and illegally collected should be returned uniformly. The proposal was adopted.</p>
<p>5.  ) Zhang Tongxing proposed that a lawsuit be filed in accordance with the law to punish the director of the tax bureau who illegally levied donations. The proposal was adopted.</p>
<p>6.  ) Representative Gu Baoxiang proposed that the association should hire legal counsel. The proposal was adopted to hire lawyers Feng Xizui and Zhang Bingjun as legal counsel for the association.</p>
<p>7.  ) How should the association's funds be raised? The decision was made that the representatives would donate the funds without raising additional funds.</p>
<p>Finally, it was resolved to issue a declaration requesting assistance from all sectors.</p>
<p>The Road Construction Fundraising Will Soon Conclude</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Chinese National Road Construction Association's membership drive, almost a month has passed. The first and second announcements of the scores totaled 10,840 yuan, which is a good result. It is reported that the association is scheduled to hold a third scoring report at the New World Free Hall this Thursday, the 20th, at 3:00 PM, with tea and snacks. They will report on the conclusion of the fundraising and visit the exhibition of national road market books and models. Invitations have been sent, urging team members to redouble their efforts to compete for the championship. On the same day, a temporary office will be set up next to the Free Hall to collect membership fees and application forms, so that they can be compiled into a report immediately. The agenda is as follows:</p>
<p>1.  ) Chairman reports on the opening of the meeting and expresses gratitude to the team members for their fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>2.  ) The captain gives a speech thanking the team members for their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Minutes of the Changshu Rice Merchants Guild Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Changshu Rice Merchants Guild convened an emergency meeting at its office on Changan Road in Zhabei yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Over a hundred members attended. Cao Zhenqing was elected as chairman.</p>
<p>1.  ) The chairman reported that recently, members had reported to the guild that staff from a certain association had been dispatched to the rice ships docked at Xinzha Wharf to collect membership fees by force, taking away items when they were unsuccessful. After receiving the report, the guild immediately sent staff to negotiate with the association and retrieve the items. The guild maintains a peaceful stance and does not argue. Following this, member Zhou Zhiting reported that on the morning of the 13th, at about 2:00 or 3:00 AM, the bow of his boat was secretly damaged and punctured by bandits, almost causing it to sink. Fortunately, it was discovered early and rescued, resulting in a loss of more than 30 dan of wet rice. He requested protection and strict arrest of the bandits, and asked the rice industry guild to assist in offering a reward for the arrest.</p>
<p>2.  ) Matters for discussion:</p>
<p>a) How to respond to the illegal levy by a certain association? Decision: All members of the guild are not members of that association and unanimously refuse. If there is illegal coercion, they will deal with it in accordance with the law. b) Member Zhou Zhiting was secretly harmed by bandits. Decision: They will thank the rice industry guild for offering a reward for the arrest of the criminals and write to the water patrol team to tighten their investigation to ensure the safety of merchants. c) Xingfang Ruzeng's commission and the heavy measurement of the Hushi's measurement? Decision: They will write to the rice industry guild again to inform the various banks and that the commission should still be deducted according to the previous rules and handled in accordance with the regulations of the Humi rules agreed upon by both the bank and the customer in order to show fairness. d) Confidential.</p>
<p>The meeting ended when the lights were on in every house.</p>
<p>Begging for Relief Due to the Severe Disaster in Zhengyang</p>
<p>The National Relief Commission received a telegram from Zhengyang yesterday. "Chairman Xu, after reading the report on the 10th of this month, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek asked for relief and relief for the counties and districts of the three provinces of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, which have been repeatedly ravaged by the Red Army, and only the Liuan Huoqiu Yingshan Huoshan, etc., are listed in Anhui Province. The Zhengyang Red Army has been trapped in Zhengyang, and more than 10,000 people are dying without food or clothing. I beg you to treat them equally without any gratitude. Shi Qizhou and others from the Zhengyang Relief Branch in Anhui knock."</p>
<p>Xian Municipal Ferry Changes Schedules</p>
<p>The First Bus from Gaoqiao at 6:30 AM Every Morning</p>
<p>The opening hours of the ferry in this city have been reduced by one early and one late, as is customary from October 16th to March 15th of the following year. The first bus from Donggou to Shanghai and the first bus from Gaoqiao is actually the second bus. It is learned that the ferry general management office of the Public Utilities Bureau has recently increased the number of passengers in Gaoqiao, and the second bus arrived at the Copper Man Terminal at 8:50, which is too late. In order to meet the needs, starting from October 16th of this year, the first bus from Gaoqiao will be changed to 6:30 every morning. All other matters will be handled as usual. Therefore, if Gaoqiao passengers take the earliest bus, they can arrive in Shanghai at 7:50.</p>
<p>The Fire Compensation Association in the Disaster Area Requests</p>
<p>The Social Bureau Shows a Solution as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>The National News Agency said that the Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Association convened its 13th Executive Committee meeting at the Ningbo General Chamber of Commerce on Adoia Road at 12:00 yesterday. More than a dozen people, including Fang Jiaobo, Chen Songyuan, and Tang Youwei, attended the meeting. Chairman Fang Jiaobo opened the meeting as scheduled. First, the chairman reported on the recent work situation, and then Tang Youwei reported on the negotiations with the Social Bureau the day before. Then, the various cases were discussed, and the following resolutions were made:</p>
<p>1.  ) According to the decision of the Claims Committee, the Social Bureau will be asked to show a solution as soon as possible, and Tang Youwei will be asked to draft it. 2) Each executive committee member will be notified that they must attend the meeting in person in the future. If they want to appoint a representative, only members of the association are allowed in order to be cautious.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at 3:00. The original text of the letter from the association's Yu Qiaqing to the Social Bureau is attached below:</p>
<p>[The above is omitted because the fire insurance compensation in the disaster area is due to the fact that each insurance company is trying to shirk responsibility, and there is no solution. Since each insurance client organized a claim for compensation, the situation has been serious and the impact has been great. The bureau was informed by section member Yu Tianbi that it had instructed the Insurance Association to convene a meeting within a week to determine a solution, and ordered the association to inform each insurance client to suspend the claim for compensation and wait for a solution, etc. In accordance with this, the claim team was immediately notified to suspend the process and wait for instructions. Now, most of the insurance clients have been inquiring the association about the solution, and they have been asking whether the Insurance Association has declared a decision on the bureau's instructions. Because each insurance client is in deep water and cannot wait for long, they hereby report the situation and ask the bureau to give instructions as soon as possible, so that we can follow them, and we will be grateful to the extreme.] The following is omitted.</p>

<p>Local Supplement of the Shen Bao: Truth or Falsehood? Liang Zuoyou's Donation of Gold</p>
<p>Buddha: Any strange and bizarre event must have its indirect cause. Airplanes and wireless telegraphs can be called marvels. However, whether borrowing the power of electricity or the power of air, scientists are merely using them to make inventions.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of Liang Zuoyou donating 30 million yuan, I initially suspected it, thinking that the "thousand" might be a mistake for "ten." Later, as the telegraphed news continued, I realized it was true. Now, the truth has turned into a question. What exactly is Liang Zuoyou selling in his gourd? We still don't know. However, Liang Zuoyou has been living in Beijing for a long time and couldn't even scrape together money for room and board. Such a rich man, indeed, I have not only never seen, but also never heard of. Is it the supernatural power of the monk Ji Dian, or is it Zhuge Liang's empty fort strategy played on the city wall?</p>
<p>There are many suspicious points about Liang Zuoyou donating 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>1.  How could Liang Zuoyou, who possesses 70 to 80 million yuan in assets in a country with such backward production as ours, have a family name that has never been heard of?</p>
<p>2.  How could Liang Zuoyou, who possesses 70 to 80 million yuan in assets, live so safely and without any losses in the bandit-ridden area of eastern Shandong?</p>
<p>3.  Even if Liang Zuoyou has assets, how could he throw away 30 million yuan without any hesitation? Even generous overseas Chinese have not been heard of donating such a huge sum.</p>
<p>4.  If Liang Zuoyou is such a generous person, why didn't he donate a single penny when Ma Zhanshan and the 19th Route Army were fighting against Japan?</p>
<p>Looking at the above points, Liang's donation of a huge sum is inherently suspicious. Now, it is becoming even stranger. Liang has been living in Beijing for a long time and hasn't even handed over a single penny. Even his room and board are guaranteed by the ministry. Simply put, not a single penny can be explained. Who has ever seen a rich man who doesn't have a single penny to his name? But since he doesn't have a single penny, how dare he make such grand pronouncements and petition in Beijing? That is the first suspicious point. Liang not only promised to donate a huge sum, but also researched the usage of the funds quite thoroughly. As the saying goes, "acting as if it's a big deal." That is the second suspicious point. Therefore, saying it's true seems definitely not true. Saying it's false seems not false either. A ten-foot-tall monk leaves one completely baffled.</p>
<p>Someone said that Liang Zuoyou's donation of 30 million yuan is a strategy. In reality, Liang only donated one silver dollar. His idea is that if the 30 million people of Shandong province each donated one yuan like Liang, then 30 million yuan could be obtained. If they each donated two yuan, then 60 million yuan could be obtained. If that's the case, it's truly making a fool of the world. Why doesn't Liang say he'll donate 400 million yuan? Our country has 400 million people. If each person donates one silver dollar, then 400 million yuan can be obtained. If each person donates two silver dollars, then 800 million yuan can be obtained. This kind of wishful thinking is not only in Liang Zuoyou's mind. Everyone has probably had such wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter what, I cannot believe Liang Zuoyou's donation of 30 million yuan.</p>

<p>Scientific Electric Eye and Its Uses</p>
<p>Zuo Qi</p>
<p>What is called an "electric eye" is an electrical device that is unusually sensitive to light. It is a recent invention, so not many people know about it. However, in the past year, photosensors have made rapid progress. The uses of electric eyes are becoming more frequent, with discoveries almost every day. They have great uses in industry and in methods of daily life. From cinemas to factories, from arenas to traffic lights, from laboratories to kitchens, electric eyes are needed everywhere. Electric eyes can be divided into four categories, each with its own special properties and uses: (1) Phototube or photocell: This is a vacuum or gas-filled cell containing a photosensitive metal plate that emits electrons when exposed to light. The emitted electron flow is then amplified using another vacuum tube. (2) Selenium cell: Selenium is an element with a photosensitive property: its resistance is extremely high in the dark, and almost no current flows through it. However, under strong light, it becomes a good conductor, and a lot of current flows through it. The amount of electricity it conducts is directly proportional to the brightness, that is, the size of its resistance is inversely proportional to the brightness. Sealing selenium in a vacuum tube creates a selenium cell. (3) Photovoltaic cell: This type of cell can generate current changes with changes in light intensity. (4) Vaporized metal plate (such as vaporized copper, etc.): It can generate a relatively large low-voltage current when exposed to light.</p>
<p>Wherever a beam of light can be interrupted, changed, or controlled by some method, the various photosensitive cells mentioned above can be used to perform calculations, detection, or capture, without hindering the object or action being calculated, detected, or captured in any way. For example, to have a standard clock's pendulum drive other clocks without adding weight to itself, just use a beam of light and a photocell to accurately record the back-and-forth movement of the standard clock pendulum without hindering its operation at all.</p>
<p>In television (i.e., wireless transmission of images), the photocell is an important tool. Its function is to convert changes in the brightness of an object's surface into changes in electric current so that they can be transmitted to distant places.</p>
<p>Photocells installed at the entrances and exits of tunnels can count the number of cars traveling through the tunnel. A special meter is installed in the manager's office of a movie theater, allowing them to know at any time how many viewers are in the theater.</p>
<p>In the future, an important use of electric eyes will be to adjust the brightness of indoor lighting. Just as we currently use thermostats to automatically adjust the indoor temperature, we will use a "light regulator" to adjust the intensity of lighting in factories or schools.</p>
<p>The use of photoelectric devices as security devices has already had significant results. For example, punching machine workers can use a beam of light and a photocell for protection. When their hand enters a dangerous area, the light beam is immediately interrupted, cutting off the motor's current and stopping the punching machine abruptly. Several large department stores in the United States have installed photocell safety switches on elevators. When someone enters a beam of light shining in the elevator's path, the elevator operator cannot close the door or start the machine, thus avoiding the occurrence of danger. Automatic door openers can be installed on private carports using photocells. When the car is ready to enter the carport, the driver only needs to point the car's headlights at the electric eye hidden at the entrance of the carport, and the door will open with a creak.</p>
<p>Since electric eyes have so many uses in industry and daily life, if we do a little more research, we can also use them in hospitals to provide various conveniences for patients. For example, hospitals have large doors that must be opened frequently, but patients do not have the strength to open them themselves. With photoelectric devices, the door will open automatically with a simple gesture from the patient. Similarly, a simple action such as raising a hand or shaking the head can also be used to ring a bell to call or send a signal to a waiter outside the room. When it gets dark outside, the indoor lights can be made to turn on automatically. And when the morning light arrives, the windows can close automatically so that patients can comfortably enjoy their breakfast in a warm room. There are many other wonderful uses that are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>In short, the greatest feature of the electric eye is the flexibility of its arrangement. Whenever and wherever a shadow or light can be used to control a task, this ever-vigilant electric eye can always tirelessly fulfill its duty.</p>
<p>Suggestions from the Society for Improving Society on the Adoption of Common Form Characters</p>
<p>Chi Fo</p>
<p>As human affairs become more complex, the function of writing becomes greater. If one engages in meticulous word-chopping, imitating the writing styles of the Qin and Han dynasties, the Six Dynasties, or the Tongcheng School, not only is there no time for such leisure, but it is also insufficient for practical application. Therefore, the writings of Sima Qian and Ban Gu, parallel prose, and classical prose can only be left to literary masters for research. For the sake of practical application, we naturally need to use vernacular Chinese. As for the characters themselves, no one has paid attention to them yet. I, however, advocate the adoption of common form characters. Although they do not conform to the principles of the six categories of Chinese characters, elementary philology, and the Shuowen Jiezi, that doesn't matter because all that matters is convenience in application.</p>
<p>Originally, writing is a symbol of thought. Now that human affairs are so complex, as long as there are symbols, why bother talking about "elegance" and "vulgarity"? For example, "yuan" in "foreign yuan" (foreign currency) should originally be written as 圓 because the character is complicated, it has been changed to 元! 圓 is also written as 园. Removing the enclosure becomes 元! There are many common form characters. When old-fashioned scholars see them, they will definitely say they are nonsensical. In fact, many common form characters are very ancient. For example, the common form character 祘 is the ancient character for 算 (calculation). The ancient character for 燈 (lamp) is 鐙, and the common form is written as 灯, with very few strokes. There is no question of vulgarity.</p>
<p>The transformation from seal script and greater seal script to clerical script and regular script, and from clerical script and regular script to running script and cursive script, is simply because human affairs have become more complex, and time has become more precious, so changes are needed to create a form of writing that is easy to write. Common form characters are the same. Following the natural course, they will naturally change. If one says that common form characters cannot be written because writing them is too vulgar, then please do not write running script or cursive script. Just carefully write seal script and clerical script. Thinking about it carefully, one might smile wryly at the silliness.</p>
<p>In short, the benefits of adopting common form characters are great: (1) They are easy to write, and (2) they save time. In this era of complex human affairs, there is indeed a need to promote them. Just look at how the invention of shorthand has had a great effect. Writing is originally a symbol of thought. The words "elegant" and "vulgar" are not an issue. I very much hope that the Ministry of Education will adopt my humble suggestion and ask experts to compile a "Dictionary of Common Form Characters." If there are friends who study elementary philology, I also hope that they will compile a specialized dictionary to preserve the essence of our country. Our country's writing is made very meaningfully. For example, the character 男 (man) is composed of 力 (strength) and 田 (field), indicating that men should engage in agriculture and not just pursue "officialdom and wealth." It also proves that our country is founded on agriculture. Adding 勇 (brave) above the character 男 (man) creates the character 勇 (brave), so those without courage are not considered men. Also, for example, the character 勞 (labor), with two 火 (fire) characters above, indicates that a rise in liver fire is the main cause of consumption. This is also very consistent with hygienic principles. I have briefly mentioned a few to give a glimpse.</p>
<p>The Terms of Exchange Between a Photography Student and a Teacher</p>
<p>Ms. Heng Pei</p>
<p>In a quiet corner of H School, English teacher Mr. T and student S began to talk after class.</p>
<p>Mr. T said, "I heard that your brother's business is very prosperous. I'd like to ask you to do something for me: My relative, Mr. N, used to work at the ××× Company, but he returned home due to some reason. Now he wants to find a job again."</p>
<p>"I'll have to ask my brother first," said student S.</p>
<p>"Please ask your brother to help him and give him a job. The salary doesn't matter," Mr. T said in a roundabout way, although he was very anxious.</p>
<p>"This is a small matter. We can certainly discuss it, but..." S stopped talking, waiting for Mr. T to ask him.</p>
<p>Page 17</p>
<p>"But what?"</p>
<p>"But I also have something I want to ask for your forgiveness, teacher. In the first English class every morning, I am often absent or late for some reason. Please mark me as present in the attendance book. I will try my best to prepare before the exam. If I fail, it will trouble you, teacher."</p>
<p>"That's no problem. I hope to have your brother's matter settled immediately."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Granted." Teacher and student shouted out in unison happily.</p>

If you don't, I'll make you suffer!]" The young mistress of the Zhang family, sitting in the position of a judge in the bedroom, secretly interrogated A Hong, the maidservant who was the subject of this secret case discovered last night. Kneeling below, A Hong lowered her head, her eyes full of tears, her body trembling incessantly. At this moment, her heart was uneasy, fully revealing her frightened and flustered state, worried that her secret dealings had been discovered by the young mistress and that she would definitely receive a severe punishment. Although this matter was entirely done under the threat of the young master, how could she explain it to the young mistress? In her mind, waves of thoughts surged like this, so she didn't answer a word to the young mistress's questions, only sobbing and shedding tears.</p>
<p>"Huh! You're doing well, still not confessing. Do you think you can cry your way out of this? Hmph, hmph, I suppose you won't confess without being tortured." Mrs. Zhang, in a fit of anger, stepped down from her seat and grabbed a two-foot-long bamboo stick from the corner, ran up, and randomly struck A Hong's back several times with a cracking sound, while shouting, "Will you confess? Will you confess? Are you going to confess?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Mistress, save me! Alas, alas, alas..." A Hong could only cry and scream.</p>
<p>"Still not confessing, I see you still have a hard mouth." Seeing that A Hong still hadn't confessed, the young mistress rolled up her sleeves, picked up the bamboo stick, and gave A Hong a second beating on her mouth, striking A Hong so hard that her mouth was full of blood.</p>
<p>"Ah yo! Mistress, don't hit me anymore! I'll talk, alas, alas, alas..."</p>
<p>"Okay, you talk. If you talk, I'll forgive you."</p>
<p>"Ah yo! How can you ask me to talk?" A Hong, forced by the young mistress, couldn't bear it any longer and thought she had to confess directly to avoid punishment. But then she thought that it would be shameful to say it, so she was in a dilemma, wanting to speak but stopping.</p>
<p>"Hurry up and say it. Exactly how many times have you slept with the young master, and how much have you cheated him out of? How did you * * * last night? Tell me everything properly, and I'll forgive you. Otherwise, your life will be in danger."</p>
<p>A Hong was still young and timid, and when she heard that her life would be in danger, she was frightened out of her wits, her face ashen, covered in sweat, and immediately confessed: "Mistress! Once."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!"</p>
<p>"Really, only once. Only once last night."</p>
<p>"Is that so?" "Never mind whether it's once or twice. I'm asking you how you seduced the young master." The young mistress's face was filled with the color of jealousy, and her eyes immediately became sharp, darting left and right, as if she was waiting for A Hong's satisfactory reply.</p>
<p>"Mistress, I'm innocent! I never seduced the young master. Last night, the young master came to my room himself."</p>
<p>"You're good at sweet talk. Not only are you shameless yourself, but you also say that people are forcing you. Hmph, how could a young master like ours be interested in a stinking thing like you? Quickly tell me the truth, or I'll hit you again."</p>
<p>"Mistress, really, last night, the mistress went out to see a movie. I was in my room, doing my work, and the young master barged in, without asking why, he pinned me down on the bed. I struggled desperately and tried to shout. Mistress, this is all the truth. If the mistress says it's not true, then beat me, and even if you beat me to death, I won't say anything else."</p>
<p>"Hm! Get up. I'll call your mother here tomorrow, and we'll talk then." At this point, the case was clear, and the female judge retired from the court, busy handling the procedures for sentencing.</p>
<p>The next day, A Hong's mother came, and the young mistress said to her, "Your daughter is misbehaving here, specializing in stealing things. I discovered it yesterday, so I called you here today to take her back." So A Hong's mother took her back home, constantly complaining to her: "Little girl, you really don't know how to behave. It was so good living in the Zhang family. Who asked you to be unruly and break this golden rice bowl? I'll see you starve to death when we get back."</p>
<p>Alas, poor A Hong. "Swallowing coptis chinensis while mute," she had no way to explain. She died bearing the false charge of "misbehaving and stealing things." The humiliating tragedy of being raped by the young master has been wrongfully buried at sea.</p>
<p>Random Thoughts, Casual Notes</p>
<p>Fearless</p>
<p>Does celebrating National Day mean the country will perish from now on? Or will China become strong from now on? If these words were true, then I would be willing not to celebrate for the rest of my life, but I think things are not that simple. The gentlemen who proposed this matter are too far-sighted, I think. We Shanghainese have a saying, "A green-bellied monkey," which means someone who doesn't remember things. But I think the two Lius and others probably also know that the people hate civil war, but they still bravely point their guns inward. Although many people have advised them, they still want to do it. Their unwavering spirit makes me admire them, but at the same time, our saying can be used to prove this. Poor our noble country, it's like Wang Xiaoer celebrating the New Year, each year is worse than the last. I remember that the year before last, on National Day, there was still a lantern festival, with very enthusiastic celebrations. Last year was still okay, but this year, it's pitiful to say, it's become silent and odorless. If we continue to have civil war, non-resistance, and no revitalization, I'm afraid we'll have to fly the flag at half-mast this time next year.</p>

<p>(Mr. and Mrs. Zhu are making a big scene, the man kneeling before his wife, the wife holding a ruler, threatening to hit him.)</p>
<p>Zhu: I didn't mean to break the rice bowl. They told me to stop, I didn't stop them!</p>
<p>Tian: I toil all day long to feed you, you good-for-nothing!</p>
<p>Zhu: But, but your every action, I never interfere!</p>
<p>Tian: Dare you? Dare you? I'll do whatever I want, it's none of your business. As long as I'm happy, I can do whatever I want.</p>
<p>Zhu: But... but... this time, you must forgive me. Let me get up and walk! (Trembling)</p>
<p>Scene 2</p>
<p>(The two are sitting side by side on the bed, acting coyly.)</p>
<p>Tian: Darling, look how easily I can suppress men, especially useless ones like this!</p>
<p>Jiang: You're really something! A real woman of valor!</p>
<p>Tian: But we have to find a way to get him to another place. Having him around is really annoying.</p>
<p>Jiang: I think we should have him be a teacher again. Luckily, the principal of ×× School is an old acquaintance of yours. He'll definitely be accommodating.</p>
<p>Tian: Dare you mention my past scandals? Is he my only old flame? If you talk nonsense again, how about I make you an old flame too?</p>

<p>(The three are sitting in the room, their facial expressions serious.)</p>
<p>Tian: (To the man) Do you know Mr. Jiang? He is my maternal uncle's brother-in-law's cousin, so we are distant relatives.</p>
<p>Zhu: I'm sorry, I don't know him. So, you're a respected relative, right? Sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>Tian: He doesn't need you to address him as "respected"!</p>
<p>Jiang: Mr. Zhu's intentions are good. Don't turn good words into bad ones. To be honest, you can be content to have a husband like him!</p>
<p>Tian: Why be content? Why?</p>
<p>Jiang: I... I... I won't tell you ......</p>
<p>Zhu: I want to go teach in another place again. Can you help me? Brother Jiang, please help me out.</p>
<p>Jiang: Of course, of course. We must find a way to get you settled in another place.</p>
<p>Scene 4</p>
<p>(After dinner at a certain hotel.)</p>
<p>Tian: Why were you so muddleheaded and talking nonsense in front of that turtle?</p>
<p>Jiang: What's the big deal? Even if he knows everything about us, what can he say? "If you want to do it, don't be afraid; if you're afraid, don't do it."</p>
<p>Tian: Really?</p>
<p>Jiang: Of course!</p>

<p>The Establishment of the Puyi Industrial Chemistry Research Society</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Jiao, a chemical industry expert and contributor to the science column of this supplement, recently pointed out that China's industrial chemistry is lagging behind and urgently needs to be promoted. However, the lack of industrial chemistry talent is a recognized problem, which has caused domestic factories to shut down due to a lack of talent or hire foreign technicians, resulting in a loss of sovereignty, which is extremely heartbreaking. Therefore, he has initiated the establishment of the Puyi Industrial Chemistry Research Society, using practical factory methods to guide students and conduct research on chemical industrial products for all sectors. All chemical products can be entrusted to the society for research. The society has accepted many research projects, and all have achieved satisfactory results. Those wishing to conduct research can contact the society at 55 Ximenli, Ximen Road, and a brochure is available for mail or in-person request.</p>
