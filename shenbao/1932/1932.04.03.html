<p>時評</p>
<h3>在野與在朝彬·</h3>
<p>每一個人各有其政治主張。每一個政黨也各有其政治主張。我們不能使其苟同更無法使其强同。</p>
<p>然而每一個人毎一政黨的政治主張却絕對應該「一贯」因爲主張即是一種自信力。這種自信力即爲一個人或一個政黨的精與生命所寄託。一</p>
<p>個人或是一個政黨。旣經審愼的研究確定了他的政治主張之後。即應終始堅持。不爲富貴所淫不爲貧賤所移。不爲威武所屈這裏只有「能行」與「不能行」的問題絕不能因着「在朝」與「在野」的環境不同而變易其主張只有虚僞的否定自己的人或黨他的主張與態度才是否定的。游移的。隨着環境而轉移變換自相矛盾的。因爲他没有堅定的信仰。也没有固定的主張。有的只是一黨甚或一己本身的利益惟其一切都是從本身的利益而打算。所以前日在野的時候可以高唱着如彼的主張而今日在朝。却又可以做出如此的行爲。以「在野」「在朝」的環境之不同而變易其主張的即爲「二重人人</p>
<p>格」的表現在人即爲政客在黨即爲投機的政治集團</p>
<p>我們不敢斷定説西歐各國的政治制度是合理的但我們不能否認西歐各國的政治家與政黨尙能保持其光明磊落的嚴正態度在野。是如何的主張。一旦在朝便本着自己的主張大胆的做。自己絕對信任自己同時也絕對的負責幹不通了。可以由他人或他黨之彈劾而下野絕不肯迎合他人或他黨的主張而苟延其生命這是一個政治家所應有的嚴正態度。亦即一個政黨所應有的嚴正態度</p>
<p>蘇聯共產黨。是無期限的執政好比人民被判爲無期徒刑意大利法西斯黨是有年限的執政。好比人民被判爲有期徒刑都是一黨專政他們是終始堅持着自己的主張由在野到在朝由秘密奮鬥到公開行動終始以絕對自。信。絕對負責的態度。努力使其主張有計劃的逐步成爲事實爲大衆謀幸福以成績昭示人民。所以人民由反抗而順從即如在英美法日。僞德謨克。拉西政治制度之下。一般的政治家與政黨。也還能保有這種態度這種態度便正是目前我國的政治家與執政的黨所没有的。</p>
<p>這裏我們並不是説主張是絕對不可以變易的。假使主張的攣易。是以大多數人民的利益爲前提是合於大多數人民的要求這種變易是必要的。我們所説的是在野標榜着適合人民要求的主張而。在朝却做出與人民利益。相背馳的行爲。我們認爲這是言不顧行。行不顧言是一種欺騙人民的勾當無論你的主張怎様。立場怎様。我們只要求「眞」要求「信」因爲眞的主張。眞的行爲我們容易辯明其是或非而否定的主張否定的行爲却很足。以淆亂我們的耳目使我們一時把握不定然而這也不。過是「一時」罷了事實上是從來没有不露出狐狸尾巴同様人民的耳目也是不可以一手永永掩盡。</p>
<p>所以我們希望目前我國的政治家與執政的黨。在朝的時候。要廻顧到在野的時候的「言」在野的時候·也要設想到在朝的時候的「行。」</p>

<h3>小組會議節外生枝</h3>
<p>軍事</p>
<p>分組委員會、昨晨同在英領署另一室開會、到我方代表十九路軍參謀長黃强·及秘書郭德華·日方代表陸軍參謀長田代皖一朗·關係國代表英使館軍事參贊桑希爾·美使館軍事參贊特萊斯台爾·法使館軍事參贊彭那維泰·及意使館軍事參贊法拉鐵尼·軍事小組委員會星期四會議、已商定日軍退駐地點三處、即引翔方面爲引翔港一带、江灣方面爲萬國體育場一带、吳淞方面爲吳淞鎭至蕰藻浜張華浜一带、惟閘北方面、日本公墓至六三花園一带、以我方不能同意、故未决定、前日休會期間、雙方即請示首席代表昨晨再開會議、雙方即根據訓令繼續討論、日方仍謂、日軍五萬人、馬五千匹、大小[P昨日出席停戰會議友邦與我方代表</p>
<p>砲百五十尊、飛機五十架、上述三處、不足容納、閘北方面、日本公墓至六三花園一带、仍須暫由日本駐兵、張華浜方面亦須擴充至曹家橋、我方堅不同意、中立方面當提出轉園辦法、主張日方如堅欲駐兵閘北、則蕰藻浜北岸吳淞鎭一带、應予放棄、日方對此表示反對、中立方面、遂向中日代表建議、商請雙方首席代表後、星期一再開會議、繼續討論、聞雙方於重復討論撤兵地點之際、日方忽提出訽問我國軍隊在蘇州河以南與南市浦東等處之防務情形、我方當以此事與停戰會議無關、日方不能藉停戰會議之口、而詢問關於我全國之軍隊動情、故嚴詞拒絕、各友邦出席之武官、亦甚詫異、結果、遂因此事小組會之情形、乃大形惡化、至十二時三十五分、遂無結果而散、</p>

<h3>郭泰祺答客問</h3>
<p>日方確不能遵照國聯决議案原則</p>
<p>另一方式完成日軍撤退我未承認連日停戰會議討論中心、在於日本撤兵地點及期限、實情如何、頗爲各方注意、各團體救國聯合會、昨晨八時、特推代表殷芝齡王葆眞、往謁外交次長郭泰祺、詢　問數點、作問答如左、（問）連日停戰會議討論日軍撤退地點及時間、因日本堅持吳淞江灣引翔閘北等重要軍事地點、劃作撤兵暫駐屯地、且不願規定完成撤退時日、與停戰會議之原則、（日軍應撤回至一月廿八日前情况）及三月四日國聯大會决議案、（日本應即撤兵）有無違背、（答）日方確不能完全遵照國聯議决之原則、（問）日本所持吳淞江灣引翔閘北等撤兵暫駐屯地、面積雖僅數方里、但均係集中駐防軍事地點、若我軍人守原防、則日軍因集中讓出之區域內、我國行政能否自由行使、（答）若日軍以集中駐屯軍事要地爲撤兵、則全區行政當然不能自由行使、（問）外傳日本在協定內、不願規定完成撤兵時日、或將由日方自動聲明完成撤兵時日、是否確實、（答）外間有此説法、即以另一方式表示完成日軍撤退時日、但尙未經我方承認、末後殷王等陳述意見、如日本僅允將日軍集中吳淞江灣引翔閘北等重要軍事地點、面積雖僅數方里、但因日兵撤讓區域、我軍仍不能進駐、而日軍完成撤退日期、又不在協定內規定、則不但行政不能獨立、且領土亦難完整、全國民衆誓死反對、應請特别注意愼重辦理、否則先生爲此次停戰會議之我國首席代表全、國皆知由公負會議全責、我國軍事代表僅陪席而已、非與對方代表以軍人爲主體可比、應請爲國愼重、萬勿鑄成大錯、使國家陷入萬动不復之境地云、</p>
<h3>停戰會議昨日大會攝影</h3>
<h3>前方日軍時來挑戰</h3>
<p>均爲我軍擊退</p>
<p>崑山二日專電云、滬傳太倉失守訊、經記者親往前綫考察、絕對不確、且我軍防線仍一無變動、惟日兵不時在我沿哨線騷擾、但均被我擊退、一日午、二日晨、敵便衣隊百餘名、曾兩次向距太倉正面五里許之橫瀝橋一带我軍陣騷擾、經我</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>軍還擊、敵即潰散、南翔西南李家樓之敵、於一日移至紀王廟北岸、並在邊搆築工事、架設機槍重砲、禁止交通、</p>
<p>常熟二日專電云、一日、太倉柬接觸、敵不支退時、將三橋炸燬、我軍過河追擊、斃敵多人、二日畫太倉新唐市一带、未聞砲聲、周吉橋各鄕、絕無居民、該處每日申刻至翌晨辰刻、常有接觸、敵匿浮橋民家、今被民焚、敵不及逃者多斃、</p>
<p>蘇州二日專電云、浮橋附近各村被敵佔、姦擄、居民大忿、一日未自行焚去四村、浮橋發現太陽旗、敵出没不定、瀏河茜涇新塘一带、敵掘壕忙、設大砲多尊、並不前進、居民多逃、橫瀝橋二日晨、敵三千餘與我哨戰一小時敵退、我傷一兵、</p>
<h3>停戰會議昨日小組會議攝影</h3>
<h3>軍部更正謠傳</h3>
<p>太倉並未失守</p>
<p>十九路軍總指揮部參謀處來電云、各報館均鑒、頃閲四月一日時報、登載日軍入太倉城一段新聞、查與事實完全不符、近來日軍雖時有騷擾、但均經我軍擊退、太倉仍爲我軍扼守、我軍更無預定放棄太倉計劃、請特别更正、以後并祈愼重登載軍事消息、是爲至禱、十九路軍總指揮部參謀處冬印、</p>
<p>十九路軍後方辦事處消息云、日軍進佔太倉之説、全係謠言、業經本處辯正、茲又據本路軍交通處處長唐德煌來電更正、茲將原文錄下、范主任勛鑒、滬報載日佔太倉説、毫無根據、應即更正、聞該項消息來源、係日人廣播電臺所朦混播散、以期淆亂人心、并希轉屬各方注意爲要、唐德煌叩、冬、</p>
<h3>張治中陳銘樞觀察停戰會議前途</h3>
<p>如果破裂準備犠牲</p>
<p>自身能力維持命運</p>
<p>南京二日專電云、張治中談、停戰期內、形勢依然嚴重、日軍常以小部四出擾亂、因我軍防範嚴密、故不得逞、現日軍以嘉定南翔爲第一防綫、眞如大塲閘北爲第二防綫、鐵道以東爲第三防綫、其在前綫者三四萬人、連在後方之部隊、共七萬餘人、我方則誓盡軍人天職、守土衛國、服從中央命令、如日軍再犯我方防綫、必當繼續抵抗、準備犠牲、至停戰會議要點我方堅持依原則規定、第一步日軍撤至租界以內地區、第二步撤兵回國、第三步政治問題、但日方一味狡展、並要求將政治問題、提出討論、我方萬難承認、故迄無若何結果、</p>
<p>陳銘樞談、停戰會開議多次、我方尊重列國調停善意、極望促成和平、但日方野心未已、不惜違背國聯决護、及雙方議定原則、態度旣狡猾、又强硬、故停戰會議前途非常暗淡、會議設或破裂、戰禍立可復作、必仍賴自身能力、以維持未來命運、到最後時期、惟有拚四萬萬頭顱、與五千年國祚同存亡、</p>
<h3>英倫人士深慮滬戰復作</h3>
<p>英報評論之一斑</p>
<p>路透社八日倫敦電云、衆方以爲上海中日休戰談判、波折雖多、而正在向前進步中、乃忽得上海傳來消息、豫料有復戰之可能、於是政界爲之驚駭、衆覺日本之過事苛求、實使雙方格格不能相入、但當局現仍信賴英使監溥森爵士敏捷之外交手腕、而助以他國之外交代表、必能覓得可使雙方接受之日軍撤退方案、東京傳來消息、謂日本已徇從中國之要求、不復主張佔據吳淞砲臺或江灣村、當局聞之、殊爲欣慰、目下之爭點、顯僅在日軍撤退之實在日期、而不可信恃之日人、則欲獲不再作抵制日貨運動之保障、滿洲僞政府之佔據海關、與截留鹽税、英人至爲關心、現皆密切注意此事、近來報章雖常有『日本有退出國聯之可能』之標題、但絕少著論秤擊者、歐洲現方聚精會神、以謀中歐各國之善後事務、四月十二日國聯行政會開會、必將專議此事、而不涉及其他、遠東爭端、將聽國聯大會之特委會辦理、該會現常接報告、遇有緊張氣象時、將召集全體大會、目下則無在五月以前召集此種會議之徵象、足證特委會並不過分重視中國方面所稱完全僵局之言也、星期杪評論報總論中日爭案局勢、謂日本現漸漸放棄尊重對國聯所發諾言之僞表、深望列强勿爲最近日本之恫嚇所動、該報又謂、列强依國聯會章第十五條取堅决之共同行動、必能迫令日本撤兵、縱此舉將引起東京之革命、亦宜弗加顧慮、如外本西門希圖信賴一方面美國另一方面日內瓦各小國所表示之勇敢、而依違其間、則不特將引起英美政府間之衝突、且將引起英政府與自治領如加拿大南斐間之衝突、蓋自治領皆不願見英國立於日本方面而拒美國也云云、外交部聲稱、外相西門對於遠東問題、未定切實方針、而唯待上海談判之結果、故在事勢發展未確定以前、當局仍保持全無成見之態度云、</p>
<h3>菲島僑胞指捐張將軍</h3>
<p>先匯三千元</p>
<p>本報昨接菲島來電云、上海申報館轉交張發奎將軍、貴軍東指、爲國殺敵、僑衆歡騰、莫可名狀、茲先匯申　三千元、電付上海廣東銀行、轉交貴軍經費、收妥賜覆、旅菲廣東會館聯合團體籌欵對日會東、本館當以匯欵者指定轉交張氏、惟張軍現正由湘入贛、一俟到達前線、自即通知銀行逕付、並請覆電、以淸手續云、</p>

<h3>馬衛里論東北問題國際聯盟</h3>
<p>（翰）</p>
<p>日內瓦報主筆馬衛里、對於中日糾紛著論甚富、態度尙稱公允、近著「滿州與國際聯盟」一文、其英文稿發表於倫敦之「中國雜誌、」法文稿則在法文「中國國民集誌」最近出版之八卷三十四號上刋載、亟將全文譯出、以供國人參考、（一）滿州問題複雜原因之種種關於滿州問題之中日糾紛、已使國聯處於從來未有的困難情形之下、而事件之棘手、更非我人想像所能及</p>
<p>試溯旣往、國聯所排除之糾紛事件、如希臘與布加里、鮑里、維與柏拉甘、皆爲易於措置之小國家、如高夫事件、雖糾紛之一造爲一大强國、且爲國聯行政院之常任委員、但糾紛目的之地點、適在地中海之核心、距離旣近自易鞭策、祇須海軍略加示威、即可發生完滿之効果、滿州則不然、其地離歐甚遠實際上非歐洲海陸軍所能調處、且糾紛兩造、皆爲大國兩造之一、且爲行政院常任委員、</p>
<p>此事件之特殊性質旣如此、而斯遠東之兩大國、皆列席行政會議桌、各以爭點向其他散佈全世界之十四國代表諄諄呈述、可見現代人類關係之進化亦甚明顯也、</p>
<p>歐洲各國家之主權、界限至爲分明、任何國家之領土、絶無紛爭錯雜之權利存在、各國皆自深知居於何處、其所據領土之權力爲何、在滿州則不然、中國之主權固無可爭議、惟主權之性質、略含表面空洞、在張學良懸掛黨國旗之前、滿州當局已否切實承認中國之主權、實一問題、（按此點著者觀察有誤）</p>
<p>且也、滿州因其他種種理由、與非國聯會員之美俄兩國發生直接關係、而兩者之一、其對國聯之態度爲敵視的、而非善意的、凡此諸點皆使國聯在實際上感覺非常困難、假使問題無法解、决國聯之過雖無可、辭但仍有寛恕之原因在也因此、國聯之四周亦多忠告、國聯對於滿州事件、以少入漩渦爲妙、苟國聯而混入漩渦、則非但愈感棘手、對於問題本身、亦毫不討好、但國聯忠於盟約皇皇之條文、與其和平使命之精神、决不容輕卸其所負之責任、故國聯負此任務、實無懈可擊惟國聯旣負此任務對於上述種種情形亦當有審愼考量之權俾其行動有相當之效果、</p>
<p>我人對於國聯、若欲下一公平之判斷、則必須假定若無國聯之存、在與目前我人所處之情形作一比較、</p>
<p>（二）對於國聯下公平之判斷日本之軍閥、在精密計算之下、利用時間發動、確欲在極短期間迅速侵占滿州、並永遠據領之、此乃毫無疑慮之事實、惟中日武力之强弱、判若天壞、中國內亂循環不息世界經濟、又如此凋落、中國政府之不能得列强有効的援助、即與中國最親善之友邦、亦有所不能、環顧世界、竟無絲毫嚴正之力量、足以牽制日本對於滿州計劃之完成、此亦爲吾人所敢斷定者也、中國之報紙、曾屢以日本掠奪滿州之手段與滅亡朝鮮之手段等量齊觀、但若無國聯參加行動、則此並行觀將更臻圓滿、滿州至於今日、亦早步朝鮮之後塵矣、</p>
<p>目前情形、雖不能令人滿意、究與朝鮮時代不同、滿州在法律上、始終爲中國之滿州、日內瓦與巴黎之會議討論、均已使全世界之與論、對於該地所經過之事實、加以深切之注意、日本侵略滿州之行動、若欲逹到目的、固須在不知不覺中、採用一種迅雷不及掩耳之手段、若在各民族閉關自守之時代、旣無國聯供中國高立演壇、呈訴事實之機會、對於各民族、旣不能引起注意、又不能引起公憤、則日本之行動、猶可冀其實現、惟今日自禍變四月以來、日本軍閥固猶未逹到其目的、且在世界人土衆目暌暌之下、亦極難逹到其目的也、</p>
<p>人人皆知時間往往與中國極爲有利、故日本之行動、亦愈感困難、最近之過程已證明、日本每次對華取强硬之手段、則其對華貿易之輸出、立告停頓、經濟方面、亦立即受一大打擊、使日本不得不出於緩和、且有時陷于自相矛盾之狀態、若滿州一日在中國主權名義之下、則中國之移民、遠超日本之殖民、日本終不能將滿州完全據爲己有也、故我人敢信國聯受理此糾紛事件、雖極優柔寡斷、表面上無論如何、確爲中國保全滿州、尤其是保全中國之面子、蓋中國軍事上之不抵抗非但不足以示其懦弱、反足以顯出中國對於國際公法尊視也、故滿州事件、使中國之名譽日隆、日本之名譽日貶、此爲我人對於此一事件之政治的判斷、必須非常注意之要素也、</p>
<p>而行政會遺派國際調查團往滿州之决議案、亦不可加以輕視調查團之份、子皆爲舉世望重之人物、到逹目的地後、當令日本軍閥無法完成其目的、即吞佔滿州是也、事有非監督所及而竟成者、但在世界衆目昭彰之下、亦就無實現之可能矣、無論調查團之權力爲何、調查團必將注意滿州之法律地位與政治地位、其工作之結果、必與日本之所希望者截然相反、而使中國對於東三省之主權更形鞏固、不若以前之易於旁落、此亦爲意料所及、不必驚奇者也、（但東三省已有僞國出現、此非著者初料所及也）</p>
<p>但我人之情緖、决不能因此認國聯之行動爲已足、我人早希望行政院對日本之説話、格外高爽響亮、並盡力之所能、實行盟約上一切關於維持和平之條欵、不幸竟未見實現、其種種理由、亦有深刻分析之必要、</p>
<p>（三）滿州事件之兩要素滿州事件之呈於世界輿論者、可分别爲兩種要素、其實糾紛有二、一則事實至爲明顯、亦極易得一判斷、即日本與國聯之關係是、一會員國且爲行政院常任委、員竟至違反盟約、令其軍隊越出其應駐地點、而侵占另一會員國之領土、國際公法爲其破壞、至爲明顯、則負守護國際公法之國聯、自當起而擁護之、</p>
<p>但在此糾紛以外、尙有一其他糾紛、起於中日間、其糾紛之內容、較上述之糾紛複雜萬倍、遠方之人視之、更覺糢糊不可捉摸、日人責華人違反關於滿州之條約、日人提出爲保護其安全計、有勦匪之必要、（按東北若須勦匪、其責在執有主權之中國、决非日本）華人方面則否認種種條約之合法、尤其是日人對於此項條約之解釋、我人對於以上各點均可以有一種意見、但吾人不敢言其解决辦法必爲如此、蓋歐人對上述種種問題、所擬之解决辦法、至爲紛岐也、日本與國聯間所存在之困難、其性質適足以促使一般和平之友聯合一致、而中國與日本間之糾紛則使各國之態度趨於紛岐、</p>
<p>是故中國出席行政政院之代表、其行動至爲敏捷合理、自始即在行政會將此二問題分别討論、要求國聯首先完成第一問題之義務、而保留第二問題爲將來交涉之地步、</p>
<p>日本則反是、其在國聯行政會之言行、以及一部份日本可以發縱指使之歐州報紙、莫不極力設法使兩問題混攙一起使我人之思想至爲紊亂、日本此種手段已逹到相當成功、此爲我人所不得不承認者也、</p>
<p>（四）美國與國聯互相推諉究其如此易於成功、其理由有二、第一爲美國之行動、華盛頓政府對於此一事件、不特有重大之利害關係、抑且負嚴重之責任、國聯若無美國之助、即無能力活動、蓋每次日本政府感覺華盛頓與日內瓦之情緖不一致時、日本政府即極力違抗國聯之命令、故此事自始即須使國聯與美國立於共同行動之一條戰綫上、乃美國表面上雖極誠意一致行動、仍難實行、蓋華盛頓方面、對於問題之要素、以及國聯運用之關鍵、皆非常隔膜也、</p>
<p>華盛頓對於問題之要素、消息隔膜之故、蓋由於日本在華盛頓有强有力之代表、據吾人所知、中國竟無人代表、日本旣無對手方之相持、於是問題兩要素混攙一起之技倆、即非常易衣成功矣、且也華盛頓方面、對於國聯行政院眞切意思、完全昌昩、最近雙方接觸關係、仍不足以挽救過去所鑄之錯誤、以致雙方發生誤會美國列席行政會之代表、曾經更易於是代表自身之隔膜、更加重美國政府之隔膜、因此、美國與國聯、雖極願携手合作、態度皆甚一致、而無形中竟造成相互牽制、不能行動之奇特狀態、</p>
<p>國聯之意、其出發點非常正確、蓋國聯認明美國對於此事件之利害、居於主要地位、故行動之邊際如何决定、須視美國之願望若何、國聯則僅能給美國以權威的臂助而已、至美國政府則反是、其用意亦未始不合、彼認國聯爲世界上最高之道德力量、美國旣願贊助國聯、國聯將如何行動、胥由匣聯自言之、於是國聯與美國、兩者之行動、發生游移、兩者互相推諉、互相贊助、而兩者之勢力、反日益薄弱、（未完）</p>

<p>衣·食·住·行·爲人生的四大要素，尤其是住在上海謀生活的人們，住的問題，更爲重要，更爲痛苦，無論士農工商，每日辛苦勞力所得，至少大部分要報效房主，此種情形，不但此次次事變時如此·即戰前之滬上狀態，各業之種種利益·大半均爲房主所榨取無遺，此原爲滬上社會奇形發展的狀態也，溯自一二八滬變以還，閘北·吳淞·等處居民商店的重大犠牲，且莫論，即以英法兩租界而言，各業罷市，已逾兩月，連日各路商店，雖已陸續復業，然市面蕭條，已非昔比，故商界聯合會等多數建議，减免房租，維持現狀，最近市商會通告房主，自動减租，以蘇商困，此原爲目前滬上所最要而最急迫的問題，亦爲目前先應當討論而研究之問題，</p>
<p>現據各方意見；有設「公益機關，以房租爲基金者，應不在减免之例」有謂「如願减免房租，房客宜就近調查房主之經濟狀况，因富商而置產者，固不乏人·然租地造屋者，做押疑造屋者，孩兒孤婦依房租爲生活者，亦所在皆是，此種情形，原爲上海經濟情形之特别組織，自然亦當加以精密的攷慮，　　本來，無論做那一件事情，事先必要經過幾度詳細的攷量，庶臨事不致窒碍而難行，即如此次减租運動一事，天然亦難逃此定例，在房客方面，應當着想，即在房主方面，自然也要去着想，但天下事，利害總是衝突的鮮有兩利俱存的事，并且减租運動，尤爲利害衝突之更顯著者，</p>
<p>近年滬上地價房租之繼漲增高，其原因雖至爲複雜，但爲一般地皮掮客，與租地造屋者，押欵造屋者，操奇計贏，希圖厚利，亦爲上海地價年高一年，住民生活年苦一年之最大原因，則在此狀態之下，若輩亦自應負其相當之責任·故此次减租運動，亦只能謀最大多數之最大利益爲前提，若必欲事事顧到，處處顧到，恐天下無可成的事，</p>

<h3>有聲電影</h3>
<p>— 乃徵</p>
<p>有聲電影自美國放映以後，過未多時，即風靡全球。我國上海南京蘇州等埠之各大戲院，亦已放映二年餘，又造成有聲電影迷不少。滬上明星公司首先同百代公司攝收有聲影片，但音語零收在蠟盤上。天一公司乃費極大之價，至美國購來全付收攝機械，並隨來攝影收音洗片師等。今已出二片，乃係片上發音者。後明星公司不願示弱，乃费鉅金往購可攝自然彩色之收音機器。至今日有聲電影有如此之發逹；一有佳片，我人無不踴躍往觀，但對於如何攝成，如何發音，則知者寥寥無幾，今余以淺普之理，及其自收攝至放映之步驟，簡單説明之。</p>
<p>有聲電影發音之方法，略言之，可分二種。一爲使用留聲機唱片相同之唱片發音，使其廻轉時與放映機相伴，此謂之維太風Ｖｉｔａｐｈｏｎｅｏ一爲在片邊上之光條所發音，謂之慕維通Ｗｏｖｉｅｔｉｏｎｅ　　維太風於一八九四年由美國怪傑愛迪生氏發明，其音收於零外之圓片上，在戲院放映時，用電留聲機發音，同時擴大其音，以電線通於銀幕後之喇叭，於是再由喇叭內放出音樂言語等聲。此法之麻煩處即收音與攝影之時間，須配之極準，即在戲院放映時，亦須預先試正。轉電留聲機之小馬逹，與轉片之馬逹，必須快慢適當，務使聲音與動作相吻合。倘若雙方不合，或片中斷去數尺；則我人見劇中人之唇已動，而音語未來；鋼琴蓋未開，而音調已鏘鏘出。以致弄得笑話百出；此爲維太風之弱點·其他如聲音之不淸楚，並有蠟片旋轉時之雜聲，或多映數次後音片上之細紋刻平而使音糊塗，皆令觀者不滿。滬上所映之歌女紅牡丹即此維太風發音。然萬事必有進步改良，今風行一時之慕維通即可免此弊矣。</p>
<p>慕維通爲美國人特福勒斯ＤｅＦｏｒｅａｔ博士所發明之方法製成，當是時，歐洲各國對於有聲電影之機械亦有種種之發明·但最須向之敬謝者，即發明將音波攝爲照片之波紋之路麥羅氏。今能使有聲電影更進步者，則爲光電池與三極眞空管。無論何種有聲電影皆須用此，以增其效用也。光電池可使音波變爲縐紋而攝於片邊上；三極眞空管即如吾人所見之無線電收音機中之眞空管，當收音與發音時皆需要之。以上二器，爲慕維通中最重要之機件。</p>
<p>收攝有聲片時，聲音與光線有同様之重要。演員之動作與言語亦須同時注意。一面攝影，一面送話器收音。送話器即如無線電播音用的相同，但較精細耳。音語一入此器，再由增幅器擴大之。（此器蠟片收音時亦用之；即放映時亦不可缺此；又無線電放送接收之機中亦用增幅器）。</p>
<p>音波經增幅器後所成之電流，即送入一能使光源生變化之電泡中，因此電泡中光度之變化强弱粗細，乃感影於影片之旁邊，成短而橫的條紋。其條紋甚細時，則音高而尖；甚粗時，則音低而鈍。放映時，此攝成之片須通過光電池之前面，由光電池所來之電流，通過增幅器而增大之；然後再通至總增幅器中，而送於銀幕後之喇叭中，傳入觀客之耳，觀客目中所見之表情，亦與音語符合，此即慕維通勝過維太風之要點也。</p>

<h3>德國航空人才的養成</h3>
<p>— 丘星</p>
<p>戰敗後的德意志人，對於種種復興事業，都非常拼命地努力，我們眼見着的，都顯然有長足的進步：最可佩服的，就是他們對於各種復興事業，都具有計劃，組織，研究，徹底的。</p>
<p>今日德意志航空事業的發逹，眞令人咋舌，不過他們自經軍備大限制的結果，關於軍用上的飛行，都遭禁止，因此那些歐戰時，曾經百戰而富有經騐的飛行勇士，也由軍人飛行家投到民間飛行界來了。民間飛行界自從得了他們的帮忙和貢獻，比以前更加進步得利害。　　不過這般先進的優秀飛行家，怎能永遠存在呢？有時遭了意外的危險，也免不了的，因此一般新進的飛行家，就應運而生了。德意志指導飛行業的人，對於這般新進人才的養成，用最眞實，最徹底的方法來指導他們，因爲德國航空業的發逹，故極需要這般新進人才，所以對於他們，不惜投下鉅欵，作養成基金。</p>
<p>凡有志願做飛行家的靑年，先要經過簡易航空學校的預備試騐，用格後，才得進國立航空學校。國立航空學校設有飛行術，機關，航空，無線電，國際法等科目，此个還要學習兩國以上的外國語。校中也有敎習飛行機械學，木製飛機和鋼製飛機，兩個分開專門研究，試騐方面則非常艱難。學費約花國幣一萬五千元</p>
<p>不過最可注意的，就是該費，學生方面僅負担三千五百元，其餘慨由漢查航空公司和政府負担。這間學校畢業出來的學生，可以在漢查航空公司做二等飛行士，不過最低限度要飛過四萬基羅米突。以後再從這般航空員中，陸續提拔出優秀者升爲正式飛行士，最初薪金每年約國幣一千二百元，此外飛行一基羅米突，則給與一鎊半。</p>
<p>祇看德意志飛行人才養成的方法，就見得他們基礎的良好。所以由這良好的復興事業的基礎，可推想到德意志戰後的一切復興的精華和進步。（却酬）</p>

<h3>On Being Out of Office vs. Being in Office</h3>
<p>Every individual has their own political views. Every political party also has its own political views. We cannot force them to agree, let alone compel them.</p>
<p>However, the political views of every individual and every political party should absolutely be "consistent" because an opinion is a form of self-confidence. This self-confidence is where the essence and life of an individual or a political party reside.</p>
<p>Once an individual or a political party has carefully researched and determined their political views, they should adhere to them from beginning to end. Not corrupted by wealth, not swayed by poverty, not subdued by force. The only question here is "can it be done" or "cannot it be done." Their views should never be changed based on whether they are "in office" or "out of office." Only those who falsely deny themselves, their views, and their attitudes are negative, wavering, changing with the environment, and self-contradictory, because they have no firm beliefs and no fixed opinions. All they have is the interests of their party or even themselves. Because everything is calculated from their own interests, they can sing lofty tunes when they are out of office, but when they are in office, they can do the opposite. Changing one's views based on the different circumstances of being "out of office" versus "in office" is a manifestation of a "dual personality." In an individual, it is a politician; in a party, it is a speculative political group.</p>
<p>We dare not say that the political systems of Western European countries are reasonable, but we cannot deny that the politicians and political parties of Western European countries can still maintain their open and upright, serious attitude. What are their views when they are out of office? Once in office, they boldly act according to their views. They absolutely trust themselves and are absolutely responsible. If it doesn't work, they can be impeached by others or other parties and step down. They are never willing to cater to the views of others or other parties to prolong their lives. This is the serious attitude that a politician should have, and it is also the serious attitude that a political party should have.</p>
<p>The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is in power indefinitely, like the people being sentenced to life imprisonment. The Italian Fascist Party is in power for a limited time, like the people being sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment. Both are one-party dictatorships. They adhere to their own views from beginning to end, from being out of office to being in office, from secret struggles to public actions. From beginning to end, they strive to make their views a reality in a planned and step-by-step manner, to seek happiness for the masses and to demonstrate their achievements to the people, with absolute self-confidence and absolute responsibility. Therefore, the people change from resistance to obedience, just like under the pseudo-democratic political systems of England, America, France, and Japan. Ordinary politicians and political parties can still maintain this attitude. This attitude is precisely what our country's current politicians and ruling party lack.</p>
<p>Here, we are not saying that views cannot be changed at all. If the change of views is based on the interests of the majority of the people and meets the demands of the majority of the people, then this change is necessary. What we are saying is that when out of office, they advocate views that are suitable for the people's demands, but when in office, they do things that are contrary to the people's interests. We believe that this is not keeping one's word and not acting according to one's words. It is a deception of the people. No matter what your views are, no matter what your position is, we only ask for "truth" and "trust" because we can easily distinguish between right and wrong of true views and true actions, while negative views and negative actions are very likely to confuse our ears and eyes, making us unable to grasp them for a while. However, this is only "temporary." In fact, the fox's tail always shows. Similarly, the people's ears and eyes cannot be covered forever by one hand.</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope that our country's current politicians and ruling party, when in office, will look back at the "words" they said when they were out of office, and when they are out of office, they should also think about the "actions" they will take when they are in office.</p>
<h3>The Ceasefire Conference Still Makes No Progress</h3>
<p>Japan's Troop Withdrawal Deadline and Repatriation Location</p>
<p>Repeated Discussions Yesterday Yielded No Results</p>
<p>Scheduled to Continue Discussions Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>The ceasefire conference is currently hovering at a final critical juncture. The tenth plenary session yesterday morning discussed the issue of Japan's troop withdrawal deadline but still reached no final decision. The military subcommittee also met simultaneously yesterday morning to discuss the issue of the location where Japanese troops would be repatriated. Because the disputed points regarding Zhabei were still unresolved, there were no results. The plenary session and subcommittee are adjourned today, Sunday. They are scheduled to reconvene simultaneously tomorrow, Monday, at 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>No Decision on Withdrawal Deadline</h3>
<p>The ceasefire</p>
<p>conference held its tenth plenary session at the British Consulate yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, adjourning at 11:30 AM, making it the shortest of all sessions. Attendees from our side included Chief Representative and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi, Military Representative and Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhang Sixu, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Deng Zhongying, Yin Rugeng, Li Tiezheng, and Secretary of the 19th Route Army Zhang Yizhong. The Japanese side included Chief Representative and Commander of the 9th Division Ueda Kenkichi, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru, Chief of Naval Staff Shimada Shigetaro, Secretary of the Japanese Embassy Hayashide, and Japanese Consul Okazaki. Representatives of related countries included British Minister Lampson, American Minister Johnson, Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano, and French Minister Representative Legrand. They continued to discuss the issue of the deadline for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, divided into two steps. In the first step, Japanese troops would withdraw from the front lines to the area adjacent to the Public Concession. The Japanese side verbally stated that this could be completed within six weeks. Our side requested a limit of three weeks. This reporter learned last night that both sides had agreed on a compromise for the deadline for the first step of the Japanese troop withdrawal during yesterday morning's meeting, stipulating that Japanese troops would begin withdrawing one week after the signing of the ceasefire agreement and would complete the withdrawal within four weeks. However, the Japanese side still insisted on reserving this compromise for the final decision. As for the second step, Japanese troops would withdraw from the area adjacent to the Public Concession to their original defenses before January 28. This was still the focus of discussion at yesterday morning's meeting. The Japanese side initially continued to use the restoration of local order as an excuse. Vice Minister Guo repeatedly stated that local order had already been restored and that there were several points that could prove this. First, all stores had completely reopened for business. Second, the Public Concession and the French Concession had completely lifted martial law. Furthermore, Shanghai's overseas residents were not just Japanese; the lives and property of overseas residents of all countries were still protected by our authorities everywhere, even during the state of war. Third, it was even more obvious that local order could be restored after all Japanese troops had withdrawn. If Japanese overseas residents wanted to do business in China, advertising was the only way to promote trade. There had never been a case where sales could be successfully promoted with guns. The reason why the Chinese people were anti-Japanese, starting from the September 18th Incident last year to the January 28th Incident this year, could prove that this statement was not wrong. All the Japanese representatives were silent. At this point, the British Minister proposed forming another subcommittee to discuss the issue. The Japanese side then agreed to consult the government and continue negotiations. Therefore, yesterday morning's meeting could be said to have reached no decisions. However, all parties were trying to find a solution in a helpless situation and expressed it in another way, saying that further meetings tomorrow might yield some progress. Yesterday's meeting also passed Articles 1 and 4 of the Annex to the Agreement. It was also heard that the British Minister would summarize all the points discussed in the meetings this week during today's adjournment period and draft a new proposal for discussion tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Subcommittee Meeting Creates Unnecessary Complications</h3>
<p>The military</p>
<p>subcommittee also met yesterday morning in another room at the British Consulate. Attendees from our side included Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army Huang Qiang and Secretary Guo Dehua. The Japanese side included Chief of Staff of the Army Tashiro Kanichiro. Representatives of related countries included Military Attaché of the British Embassy Sandilands, Military Attaché of the American Embassy Trelawny, Military Attaché of the French Embassy Pennavère, and Military Attaché of the Italian Embassy Faratini. At the military subcommittee meeting on Thursday, three locations for the repatriation of Japanese troops had been agreed upon, namely the Yinxiang area, the Wanguo Sports Ground area in the Jiangwan area, and the Wusong Town to Zhang Huabang area along the Wenzaobang in the Wusong area. However, the Japanese cemetery to the Liusan Garden area in Zhabei had not been decided because our side could not agree to it. During the adjournment period the day before yesterday, both sides requested instructions from their chief representatives, and yesterday morning, the meetings were reopened, and both sides continued discussions based on their instructions. The Japanese side still stated that the above three locations were insufficient to accommodate 50,000 Japanese troops, 5,000 horses, 150 large and small [P [Caption: Allied and our representatives attending the ceasefire meeting yesterday]</p>
<p>cannons, and 50 aircraft. The area from the Japanese cemetery to the Liusan Garden in Zhabei still needed to be temporarily garrisoned by Japanese troops, and the Zhang Huabang area also needed to be expanded to Caojiaqiao. Our side firmly disagreed. The neutral side then proposed a transfer solution, arguing that if the Japanese side insisted on stationing troops in Zhabei, then the area from the north bank of the Wenzaobang to Wusong Town should be abandoned. The Japanese side expressed opposition to this. The neutral side then suggested to the Chinese and Japanese representatives that they consult with their chief representatives and reconvene on Monday to continue discussions. It was heard that during the repeated discussions on the location of the withdrawal of troops, the Japanese side suddenly raised questions about the defense situation of our country's troops in the area south of the Suzhou River and Pudong in the South City. Our side stated that this matter was irrelevant to the ceasefire conference and that the Japanese side could not use the ceasefire conference to inquire about the troop movements throughout our country. Therefore, our side sternly refused. The military attachés of the attending friendly nations were also very surprised. As a result, the situation in the subcommittee deteriorated greatly due to this matter. At 12:35 PM, it adjourned without results.</p>
<h3>Conference Announcement</h3>
<p>The tenth plenary</p>
<p>session of the ceasefire conference announced yesterday afternoon that the conference this morning made continued progress in drafting the detailed rules of the agreement. The only points that remain to be resolved are the defensive locations of the Chinese troops, the locations where Japanese troops will be stationed, and the final deadline for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. The plenary session is scheduled to reconvene on Monday afternoon. The military subcommittee announced yesterday afternoon that the military subcommittee had failed to agree on a number of fundamental points and decided to adjourn until 3:00 PM on Monday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi Answers Questions from Guests</h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Definitely Cannot Comply With the Principles of the League of Nations Resolution</p>
<p>Another Way to Complete the Withdrawal of Japanese Troops Not Recognized by Us The focus of the continuous ceasefire conference is on the location and deadline for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. What is the truth? This is of great concern to all parties. The National Salvation Federation of various groups specially sent representatives Yin Zhiling and Wang Baozhen to visit Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi at 8:00 AM yesterday morning to inquire about several points, and the answers are as follows: (Question) The continuous ceasefire conference is discussing the location and time of the withdrawal of Japanese troops. Because Japan insists on designating important military locations such as Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinxiang, and Zhabei as temporary garrisons for the withdrawal of troops and is unwilling to stipulate a date for the completion of the withdrawal, does it violate the principles of the ceasefire conference (Japanese troops should withdraw to the situation before January 28) and the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on March 4 (Japan should withdraw its troops immediately)? (Answer) The Japanese side definitely cannot fully comply with the principles of the League of Nations resolution. (Question) Although the area of the temporary garrisons for the withdrawal of troops in Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinxiang, and Zhabei insisted on by Japan is only a few square miles, they are all concentrated military locations. If our soldiers defend their original positions, can our country freely exercise administration in the area vacated by the Japanese army due to the concentration? (Answer) If the Japanese army uses the concentration of garrisoning important military locations as a withdrawal of troops, then the administration of the entire area will naturally not be able to be freely exercised. (Question) It is rumored that Japan is unwilling to stipulate a date for the completion of the withdrawal of troops in the agreement or that the Japanese side will automatically declare the date for the completion of the withdrawal of troops. Is this true? (Answer) There is such a saying in the outside world, that is, another way to express the date for the completion of the withdrawal of Japanese troops, but it has not been recognized by our side. In the end, Yin Wang and others stated their opinions, such as Japan only allowing the concentration of Japanese troops in important military locations such as Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinxiang, and Zhabei. Although the area is only a few square miles, because our army cannot enter the area vacated by the Japanese army's withdrawal, and the date of completion of the Japanese army's withdrawal is not stipulated in the agreement, not only will the administration not be independent, but the territory will also be difficult to maintain intact. The people of the whole country swear to oppose it to the death and should pay special attention to handling it carefully. Otherwise, you, sir, will be the chief representative of our country for this ceasefire conference, and the whole country knows that you will bear full responsibility for the meeting. Our country's military representatives are only accompanying guests and cannot be compared with the other party's representatives, who are mainly military personnel. Please be cautious for the sake of the country and do not make a big mistake that will plunge the country into a state of irrecoverability.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops at the Front Line Challenge From Time to Time</h3>
<p>All Were Repelled by Our Army</p>
<p>Kunshan, 2nd Instant Special Dispatch: News of the fall of Taicang in Shanghai was found to be absolutely incorrect after reporters personally investigated the front line. Furthermore, there was no change to our army's defensive line. However, Japanese soldiers harassed our sentry lines from time to time, but were all repelled by our army. On the afternoon of the 1st and the morning of the 2nd, more than 100 enemy plainclothes troops twice harassed our army's positions in the Hengli Bridge area, about five miles from the front of Taicang. After our</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>army counterattacked, the enemy collapsed and scattered. The enemy at the Lijialou southwest of Nanxiang moved to the north bank of Jiwang Temple on the 1st and built fortifications and set up machine guns and heavy artillery, prohibiting traffic.</p>
<p>Changshu, 2nd Instant Special Dispatch: On the 1st, Taicang contacted Cambodia. When the enemy was unable to support the retreat, three bridges were blown up. Our army crossed the river to pursue and killed many enemies. On the 2nd, the Taicang Xintang City area did not hear the sound of cannons. There are no residents in the Zhouji Bridge villages. There are frequent contacts every day from Shen Ke to Chen Ke the next morning. The enemy hid in the homes of the floating bridge people, and the homes have now been burned by the people, and many of the enemies who did not escape were killed.</p>
<p>Suzhou, 2nd Instant Special Dispatch: Villages near the floating bridge were occupied by the enemy, raped, and kidnapped. The residents were furious. Four villages were burned by themselves on the 1st. A sun flag was found at the floating bridge, and the enemy appeared and disappeared unpredictably. The enemy in the Liuhe Qianjing Xintang area was busy digging trenches and setting up many cannons, but did not advance. Most of the residents fled. On the morning of the 2nd at Hengli Bridge, more than 3,000 enemies fought with our sentries for one hour, and the enemy retreated. One of our soldiers was injured.</p>
<h3>Photography of Yesterday's Subcommittee Meeting of the Ceasefire Conference</h3>
<h3>Military Headquarters Corrects Rumors</h3>
<p>Taicang Has Not Fallen</p>
<p>The staff office of the General Headquarters of the 19th Route Army telegraphed: All newspapers are notified that after reading the news published in the Shanghai Times on April 1st about the Japanese army entering Taicang City, it was found to be completely inconsistent with the facts. Recently, although the Japanese army has harassed from time to time, they have all been repelled by our army. Taicang is still being held by our army, and our army has no planned intention to abandon Taicang. Please make a special correction, and please carefully publish military news in the future. The staff office of the General Headquarters of the 19th Route Army, Dong Yin.</p>
<p>The rear office of the 19th Route Army reported that the statement that the Japanese army occupied Taicang was entirely a rumor and had been refuted by the office. Now, according to the telegram from Tang Dehuang, director of the transportation office of the route army, it has been corrected again. The original text is recorded as follows: Director Fan Xunjian, the report in the Shanghai newspaper that Japan occupied Taicang has no basis and should be corrected immediately. It is heard that the source of the news was confused and broadcast by the Japanese broadcasting station in order to confuse people. Please pay attention to this matter to the various parties. Tang Dehuang respectfully bows, Dong.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong and Chen Mingshu Observe the Prospects of the Ceasefire Conference</h3>
<p>If It Breaks Down, Prepare to Sacrifice</p>
<p>Your Own Ability to Maintain Destiny</p>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd Instant Special Dispatch: Zhang Zhizhong said that during the ceasefire period, the situation remained serious. Japanese troops often went out in small groups to harass, but were unsuccessful due to our army's strict precautions. Currently, the Japanese army has Jiading and Nanxiang as the first line of defense, Zhenru, Datong, and Zhabei as the second line of defense, and the area east of the railway as the third line of defense. There are 30,000 to 40,000 people on the front line, and more than 70,000 people including the troops in the rear. Our side is determined to fulfill the duties of soldiers, defend the country, and obey the orders of the central government. If the Japanese army invades our defense line again, we will continue to resist and prepare to sacrifice. As for the key points of the ceasefire conference, our side insists on adhering to the principles and regulations. The first step is for the Japanese army to withdraw to areas within the concession, the second step is to withdraw troops back to the country, and the third step is political issues. However, the Japanese side is trying to evade them in every possible way and demand that political issues be brought up for discussion, which our side cannot recognize. Therefore, there have been no results so far.</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu said that the ceasefire conference has been held many times. Our side respects the good intentions of the mediating countries and hopes to promote peace. However, the Japanese side's ambitions have not yet been fulfilled and is willing to violate the League of Nations resolutions and the principles agreed upon by both parties. The attitude is cunning and tough, so the future of the ceasefire conference is very bleak. If the meeting breaks down, war can be resumed immediately. We must still rely on our own ability to maintain our future destiny. In the end, we can only fight with 400 million heads and coexist with 5,000 years of national destiny.</p>
<h3>British People Deeply Concerned About the Resumption of the Shanghai War</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of British Newspaper Commentary</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th Instant Telegram: All parties believe that the Sino-Japanese armistice negotiations in Shanghai, despite many twists and turns, are progressing forward. However, suddenly news came from Shanghai that there was a possibility of a resumption of the war, which shocked the political circles. Everyone felt that Japan's excessive demands were making it impossible for the two sides to agree. However, the authorities still rely on the agile diplomatic skills of British Minister Sir Lampson, assisted by diplomatic representatives from other countries, to be able to find a Japanese troop withdrawal plan that is acceptable to both sides. News came from Tokyo that Japan had complied with China's request and no longer insisted on occupying the Wusong Fort or Jiangwan Village. The authorities were very pleased to hear this. The point of contention at the moment is clearly only the actual date of the Japanese troop withdrawal, and the unreliable Japanese want to obtain guarantees that there will be no more anti-Japanese boycott movements. The British are very concerned about the occupation of customs by the Manchurian puppet government and the interception of salt taxes and are paying close attention to this matter. Although newspapers have often had headlines such as "Japan may withdraw from the League of Nations" recently, there are very few articles that criticize or attack them. Europe is now focusing its attention on seeking solutions to the aftermath of the Central European countries. The League of Nations Administrative Council will meet on April 12 and will focus on this matter without involving others. The Far East dispute will be handled by the League of Nations General Assembly's Special Committee. The committee regularly receives reports and will convene a plenary session when there is a tense atmosphere. At present, there is no sign of convening such a meeting before May, which proves that the Special Committee does not overemphasize China's claim of a complete deadlock. At the end of the week, the Commentary newspaper generally summarized the situation of the Sino-Japanese dispute, saying that Japan is now gradually abandoning the false pretense of respecting its promises to the League of Nations. It is hoped that the great powers will not be moved by Japan's recent threats. The newspaper also said that the great powers should take resolute joint action in accordance with Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, which will force Japan to withdraw its troops. Even if this move causes a revolution in Tokyo, it should not be taken into account. If Outer Banks Simen tries to rely on the courage shown by the United States on the one hand and the small countries of Geneva on the other hand and vacillates, it will not only cause conflict between the British and American governments, but also cause conflict between the British government and the autonomous territories such as Canada and South Africa, because the autonomous territories do not want to see Britain stand on the side of Japan and reject the United States. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that Foreign Minister Simon had not set a definite policy on the Far East issue, but was only waiting for the outcome of the Shanghai negotiations. Therefore, before the development of the situation is determined, the authorities still maintain a completely unbiased attitude.</p>
<h3>Philippine Overseas Chinese Donate to General Zhang</h3>
<p>First Remittance of 3,000 Yuan</p>
<p>This newspaper received a telegram from the Philippines yesterday: Shanghai Shenbao Hall forwards to General Zhang Fakui. Your army's eastward march is fighting the enemy for the country. The overseas Chinese are ecstatic and indescribable. We will first remit 3,000 yuan to Shanghai Guangdong Bank by telegram for your army's expenses. Please reply upon receipt. The United Groups of the Guangdong Hall in the Philippines is raising funds for the Anti-Japanese Association, Dong. This hall will designate the remitter to be transferred to Zhang, but Zhang's army is now entering Jiangxi from Hunan. Once they arrive at the front line, we will immediately notify the bank to pay it directly and ask for a reply by telegram to clear the procedures.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Federation Visits Guo Taiqi, Please Do Not Compromise</h3>
<p>The National Salvation Federation of various groups feared that the government would have a compromise behavior at the ceasefire conference, and sent representatives to visit Guo Taiqi at 8:00 AM yesterday to put forward their opinions: At the Japanese ceasefire conference, Japan insisted on Wusong Jiangtao Yinxiang Zhabei and other places as temporary garrisons for the withdrawal of troops for the location and time of the withdrawal of Japanese troops, and was unwilling to stipulate a date, which was clearly far from the League of Nations resolution. Guo replied that the Japanese side did have a violation of the League of Nations resolution, and at the same time made a written reply to his inquiry about Article 2 of the ceasefire agreement: Respectful reply, I received your letter and know everything about it. Article 2 of the ceasefire agreement only stipulates that our army will temporarily garrison its original defenses and will not be allowed to enter the withdrawn area. When discussing this article, I formally stated to the meeting that this provision does not impose any restrictions on the actions of our army within our national territory, and this was recorded. The contents of your letter are in fact</p>
<p>a misunderstanding. I am writing to explain it to you. Respectfully hope you will understand. Sincerely, Guo Taiqi 4/2/1. At 2:00 PM, the association held its tenth council meeting, chaired by Li Cishan. After Yin Zhiling reported on the visit to Guo, the discussion began. It was resolved on the spot: (1) Send letters to the National Lawyers Association, Lawyers Association, National Disaster Relief Association, National Salvation Association, Engineers Association, University Students Federation, University Professors Federation, Zhejiang General Association, and other representatives to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit Guo Taiqi again. (2) Decide to hold a temporary emergency meeting at 2:00 PM on the 3rd to discuss everything. The original text of their letter to Guo Taiqi is recorded as follows: Respectfully, in this ceasefire negotiation, regarding the location of the withdrawal of troops, Japan still insists on the four districts of Wusong Yinxiang Jiangwan Zhabei, and regarding the deadline for the withdrawal of troops, it is unwilling to make a clear and effective stipulation. According to Japan's past record of gaining an inch and being insincere, the so-called vast area of the aforementioned four districts will be in danger of being occupied for a long time. These areas all have great military value and are located in the city center with dense populations and convenient transportation, and they also occupy an important position in industry and commerce. If Japanese soldiers are guaranteed by the agreement to gather in these areas, the military, transportation, and economic convenience will all be taken over by the Japanese soldiers, and the political organization of our Shanghai will be completely broken, and the harm will be far greater than the reality of violent occupation. The various groups of this association believe that at such a critical juncture of life and death, there is no room for compromise. Even if it breaks down, Japan will bear full responsibility, and our country's unity against foreign aggression can be maintained from this, and we will eventually achieve final victory. Those who negotiate should consider the vast space, the vast people, the long time, and the overall interests and harms in a comprehensive manner, and should never tie the success or failure of a temporary part to their hearts. The eggs are piled on a cliff, the situation is critical, and we offer our sincerity and hope for your consideration.</p>
<h3>White Russians Assist the Japanese in Committing Violence</h3>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Russian Overseas Chinese Association to Investigate Thoroughly</p>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to K. Dengli of the Shanghai Russian Overseas Chinese Public United Committee yesterday: Dear Sir, according to Zhu Shuzhen's letter, after reading the "Sincere Statement by Russian K. Dengli" published in today's (March 18) Shenbao news column, it is very inconsistent with the facts and I have to truthfully explain the truth to your association in order to clarify the truth. The original letter said that no White Russians participated in the war effort in this brutal Japanese atrocity, which is certainly pleasant to hear, but why have many Russians been found in Jiading since the 5th of this month (March)? They committed adultery and plunder, doing everything. Recently, they have been entrenched and committing violence. It has been found that since the 3rd, after the Japanese occupied Jiading, they killed and set fires, and the White Russians joined in, searching and抄ing door to door, so that the people have nothing left, and the city and countryside have become ruins. Please Mr. K. inspect the scene in person and you will know that it is difficult for the White Russians, who are helping the tyrant, to escape the public opinion of the world. Mr. K. said that the White Russians are very willing to be loyal to our country. How should these atrocities be remedied? How should the White Russians who are running rampant in Jiading be urged to repent? Only Mr. K. can rise up to solve the problem. I am from Jiading and my relatives who have come to Shanghai from my hometown to escape the disaster have witnessed and sadly told me the whole story, which I am reporting to the association, and I hope that it will be investigated.</p>

<h3>Local Maintenance Committee Statistics of Received National Salvation Donations</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Shanghai Local Citizens Maintenance Committee has been organized by prominent figures from all walks of life to maintain the welfare of the afflicted compatriots and other relief work. The outside world has recognized the committee's sincere efforts, resulting in many donations. Overseas Chinese, in particular, have been very generous.

<h3>Shipping Gradually Returns to Normal: Wusong Night Navigation Resumes</h3>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, Wusong was within the war zone, and night navigation was prohibited for import and export merchant ships. This caused ships along the Yangtze River and coastal areas to change their departure times. Now that the battle lines have shifted west and Wusong is no longer a key military area, the Japanese flag on the fort has been removed, and the night navigation ban has been lifted. As of yesterday, the situation has returned to normal as before the war, and merchant ships can freely travel in and out at night.</p>

However, on the Yangtze River route, the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's ships have not yet resumed operations. The Yueyang Maru, Xiangyang Maru, and Mi-ike Maru have been leased by the Japanese army stationed in Shanghai for transporting grain and supplies. The Daiten Maru and Daifuku Maru have been chartered by the Japanese navy for transporting military supplies to and from Shanghai and Hankou. The Changyang Maru, Yunyang Maru, and other ships have been converted into lighters by the Japanese army. Therefore, Japanese ships on the Yangtze River have not yet resumed operations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Personnel Unwilling to Go Inland</h3>
<p>All of the senior crew members on Cheng Kee Company's merchant ships are Japanese. Now that the war has subsided, the company's "Nanhua" liners have resumed their regular services.

<p>The Shanghai Knitting Industry Association sent a letter to the British Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Commerce, stating: "We are writing to you in regards to reports from our members that some members of your Chamber have been arbitrarily imposing war risk surcharges on our members when they sell goods to them.

All Chinese are filled with grief and indignation, and they are rallying and calling on the people to respond urgently to this crisis. Although Guizhou is located in a remote border region and Zunyi is also a remote area, information is delayed. However, the great righteousness is at stake, and survival is at stake. How dare we lag behind others? Therefore, we recently convened people from all walks of life to solicit national salvation donations, totaling over one thousand yuan. We will remit the funds to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for forwarding soon. We hope to contribute to the relief effort and show our sincerity in alleviating the crisis. Even though our small contribution may not have a practical effect, it is the duty of every citizen to be concerned about the rise and fall of the nation. Please accept and acknowledge. The Zunyi County Government of Guizhou, all institutions, all schools, all legal entities, and all the people kowtow and affix their seals. (Sent on March 21, arrived on April 2)"</p>

<h3>The Jisheng Society Concludes its Relief Work at the Wounded Soldiers Hospital.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Society's 24th Wounded Soldiers Hospital, organized on behalf of the Red Cross, was located on Zhangjiabang, Jing'an Temple Road, as previously reported in the newspapers. The hospital opened on February 24 and has been operating for over a month. Now that the front lines have ceased fighting, and wounded soldiers have been successively treated and discharged, the hospital is now closing. A total of over 120 wounded soldiers were treated, with seriously wounded accounting for about half. Only three people died in the hospital, while the rest recovered and rejoiced to be discharged. The hospital director, Mr. Yu Songyun, was serious in his work and skilled in surgery. He personally went to the battlefields of Wusong and Jiangwan during the intense bombing to implement rescue work, which was especially commendable. The twenty-plus doctors, such as Chiang Yi-sheng, Tseng Yao-chu, Chang Chung-ming, Hsieh Chun-ching, and Wu Yi-chu, all dedicated themselves to their duties at the hospital, considering compassion their primary concern. The nurses and staff also did their best, working sincerely and commendably.

<h3>Former Mayor's Relief Efforts for Fellow Provincials</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army invaded Shanghai and bombarded Zhabei, over ten thousand Gan people who worked in industry and commerce in that area have been displaced and are suffering miserably. On February 8, Huang Baoxiang, a director of the Jiangxi Guildhall, initiated the organization of a refugee camp for fellow provincials. Due to financial difficulties, he sent a telegram to fellow provincials appealing for help. The camp received a reply from former Mayor Zhang, stating: "Mr. Baoxiang, and passed to Zhu, Zeng, Yu, Li, Liu, Ouyang, Jiang, Wang, Cao, Luo, Lu, Yuan, Li, Wang, and Chu, my dear fellow provincials, I read the telegram that I recently received and learned that you are calling for assistance to help our provincial fellows in need, which I greatly admire. I am now donating 200 yuan in silver dollars, a small amount to express my sincere feelings. As for the issue of repatriation, resettlement and setting up factories, if you can invite fellow provincials in Shanghai to jointly discuss and discuss relief measures, it will be easier to gather strength. I do not know if you think so, I am responding, I respectfully wish you effort, brother Dingfan on.</p>
<h3>Burial Work on the Jiangwan Front</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the United Association of Afflicted Compatriots of Jiangwan District, Shanghai, has been engaged in burial work. It buries 30, 50, and up to 100 corpses per day. From March 10 to March 31, it buried a total of 946 corpses, including 43 female corpses, 32 corpses burnt to death, one female corpse from National Central University who was raped and killed, six Japanese soldiers, and many children. Apart from those who were burnt to death or raped, the rest were killed by artillery fire, aerial bombs, or Japanese soldiers. The family of the Xu surname in Yin Jia Nong was the most tragic, with more than ten members of the family being almost completely wiped out. A list of the names of the men and women is listed as follows: Xu Genxiang, male, and his wife, Mrs. Xu; Xu Sen's wife, Mrs. Xu; Xu Chengdi, female; Xu Qunxian, female; Xu Kunxiang, male; Xu Jinjin, male, and Jinjin's wife, Mrs. Xu; Mrs. Xu Zhao; Xu Shixiang, male, and Shixiang's wife, Mrs. Xu, etc. The aforementioned corpses have now been placed in coffins by the association and buried in Guangzhao Villa and the Chongshantang Cemetery in the town to prevent epidemics as the weather warms up.</p>
<h3>The Scene of Abandoned Corpses on the Battlefield is Too Horrifying to Bear</h3>
<p>The Red Swastika Society Southeast United Relief First Team stationed at Dachang Miaohang has completed the burial work on the 10th. The entire team returned to Shanghai this afternoon. It has been heard that the team reported that the corpses recovered floating in the water were swollen, with pale skin. They were pulled with ropes, but the flesh had rotted and was difficult to lift. One nameless corpse had a cattail bag over its head and floated on the water. When the bag was removed, blood flowed from all seven orifices. Another corpse was injured and killed, and the head was crushed by a collapsed wall. An old woman with gray hair had her flesh eaten by dogs, leaving only her waist and intestines. Blood and flesh were scattered on the ground, and maggots and flies gathered on it. Another corpse was found in Miaohang, lying stiffly on the ground with goggles on its face. The goggles moved up and down, and it was suspected that the person was recovering. Upon closer inspection, there were maggots burrowing into the nose and eyes, causing the goggles to move. Such horrific scenes were endless. The team members personally placed the corpses covered in maggots into coffins. All the collected corpses have now been buried.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Citizen's Rent Reduction Committee Requests the Court to Note Wartime Rent Arrears</h3>
<p>Cannot Cite Past Precedents</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizen's Rent Reduction Movement Committee sent a letter to the court yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed court, this committee is organized by over seventy public organizations in Shanghai, with the primary aim of reducing or waiving rent to alleviate the burden. As all industries are in decline, citizens residing or conducting business in rented premises find it difficult to afford rent. Since the strike, tenants have been unable to pay rent, which has become a common occurrence. If landlords, without understanding, hastily apply Shanghai's past practices and rashly file lawsuits with your esteemed court, it will inevitably lead to unexpected disputes. Recognizing this, our committee has decided at its second meeting that tenants who have not paid rent during the wartime for three months, or those who had not paid for one or two months before the war, should not have this period included in the wartime calculation. In other words, such situations should be considered exceptions and not be subject to the general precedent of rent arrears. This point should be handled by the court with consideration. We hereby inform you of the situation and hope that you will investigate and instruct the presiding judges to handle such cases with caution, which is in the public interest." (The following is omitted), etc.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Business Association Asks the French Authorities to Pay Attention to Thieves</h3>
<p>The French Concession Business Association sent a letter to the French authorities regarding the issue of thieves. The original letter stated: "To the esteemed Director, we have recently received a letter from our member, Xing Yin Jewellery Store, located at No. 264-266 Avenue de la République, stating that on the night of March 30, they were suddenly robbed by thieves who broke into the back door, stealing gold and silver jewelry worth approximately 2,800 yuan. Our store has suffered a great shock from this incident and finds it difficult to maintain its livelihood. Therefore, we have no choice but to request your association to forward this matter to the General Police Station and request the General Inspector to find a way to solve the case, apprehend the criminals and recover the stolen items as soon as possible, which would be a great kindness. Upon receiving this, our association immediately sent personnel to investigate. The doors and windows of the premises were indeed sturdy, but they were suddenly forced open for theft. If the case is not solved quickly, it may spread and cause harm to the area, which is no small matter. Furthermore, we have learned that Zhao Puren, a rent collector for a charitable organization, was robbed of over 530 silver yuan by four bandits on March 31 while passing through the Li Xian Lane on the Xilaihuo (water from the west) Street. Such a busy place being robbed in broad daylight has made pedestrians wary. We believe that since the General Inspector has just taken office, he will certainly seek to protect the businesses and ensure the safety of the citizens within the concession. This is what our association members are hoping for. We hereby inform you accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and reply as soon as possible. Addressed to His Excellency, General Inspector Fabre of the French Concession General Police Station."</p>
<h3>The Anti-Narcotics Association Protests the Public Opium Sale in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>The Garrison Takes Advantage of the National Crisis to Profit from Narcotics</p>
<p>Villainous Elements Illegally Collect Over One Million in Taxes Annually</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Narcotics Association states that previously, the proposal for public opium sales by Wu Liande, a member of the anti-smoking committee, had been opposed by the people and was explicitly revoked. Unexpectedly, Fang Shengtao, Chairman of Fujian Province, colluded with the garrison in Fujian Province amidst the national crisis to implement public opium sales, a crime that cannot be pardoned. The association had previously sent letters to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Military Affairs of the National Government, requesting a strict investigation and punishment as a warning and to draw public attention. The original text is excerpted as follows: "To all sectors of the country: Our association, protesting against Fang Shengtao, acting chairman of Fujian Province, and the garrison colluding to collect opium taxes and implement public sales, sent a letter to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Military Affairs, stating: The reports from anti-narcotics organizations in Fuzhou and Xiamen, as well as the news published in Shanghai newspapers on March 27, indicate that local organizations in Fuzhou, Ninghua, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and other areas of Fujian Province had repeatedly opposed the garrison planting opium and collecting taxes last autumn and requested the National Government to prohibit it, but to no avail. Now, the opium paste is about to be harvested, and the donations are being collected by the various armies. It is said that each area can receive an average of about 1.5 million yuan. After the opium paste is harvested, the troops will manufacture and sell it, which will yield a huge sum of money. The Military Supplies Committee (composed of military supplies personnel from the Provincial Defense Army, the Marine Corps, and various divisions and brigades stationed in Fujian Province) established the so-called Illegal Goods Inspection Office, issuing illegal goods stamps and appointing Lin Li and Chen Ba (both pseudonyms) as deputy directors of the office, requiring them to remit 150,000 yuan per month, but deducting 25,000 yuan for entertainment expenses. The first month is a trial period, with an initial payment of 50,000 yuan. The main office is located in Fuzhou, and branch offices are located in Ninghua, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou. Collection offices are set up in all counties producing opium. The tax rate is set at 100 yuan per package of seven jin of opium paste. The headquarters in Taijiang, the provincial capital, is ready, and it will open next month. The Water Public Security Bureau will dispatch a patrol boat, twelve water police officers, and eight inspectors. The office will also hire two steamboats for patrolling and preventing smuggling. In Xiamen, the well-known opium dealers Zheng Nengpei, Chen Shiquan, Zeng Houkun, and Shi Fanqi have colluded with opium merchants to contract the collection. Although various organizations are strongly opposed, the authorities are ignoring them, which is outrageous. Public opium sales are a self-destructive system for the country. The Executive Yuan of the National Government had previously issued an explicit and permanent prohibition, and all the people unanimously vowed to oppose it to the death. However, Fang Shengtao, the acting chairman of Fujian Province, colluded with the garrison, taking advantage of the current national crisis, when foreign enemies are pressing and the central authorities are unable to attend to everything, to organize the so-called Illegal Goods Inspection Office, force the planting of opium seedlings, publicly collect taxes, and implement the public sales system. This is not only illegal but also immoral. The twenty million people of Fujian Province will be slowly killed by the garrison's narcotics policy. Our association is responsible for fighting drugs and will risk our lives to oppose the evil garrison in Fujian Province, which endangers the party and the country and poisons the people. We pledge to use all our strength to unite with the people of the country to oppose it. We earnestly request that you send high-ranking officials to Fujian to investigate and report the situation and severely punish those responsible in order to discipline the military and enforce the opium ban. This would be a great kindness." It is reported that the association is preparing to actively protest, uniting with national civil organizations to denounce the act and take effective measures to counter it.</p>
<h3>Special Beijing-Shanghai Flight</h3>
<p>Extended for Another Two Weeks</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation, to facilitate passengers and mail between Beijing and Shanghai and along the way, had established a special temporary Beijing-Shanghai flight, operating daily round trips, for a limited period of two weeks. Since its implementation, business has been very good, and mail volume has increased significantly. Therefore, it was extended for another two weeks last month. As the period has now expired, the company, in view of the increase in business and mail, has decided to extend it for another two weeks starting today, continuing to operate the flights to benefit travelers.</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun Visited the Customs Commissioner Yesterday to Discuss Renewing the Wharfage Dues Agreement</p>

<h3>Medals from the Belgian Exposition Scheduled to be Awarded</h3>
<p>In 1930, Belgium held an international exposition, and China was invited to participate. Over one hundred and eighty boxes of agricultural, industrial, and educational products were shipped there for display and competition. As a result of the competition, China ranked third and received a large number of awards and medals. The award certificates were issued to the exhibitors at a general meeting held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce last month. The medals had to be custom-made by the exhibitors through the association. It is estimated that exhibitors ordered about one hundred and sixty medals. These medals were shipped from the Belgian Exposition last month. Due to the Shanghai Incident, the representative office of the exposition did not immediately issue them. Now that the war has ceased, the representative office has decided to issue them on the 4th of this month. It is reported that exhibitors in Shanghai can bring their medal order receipts and go to the representative office at No. 1195 Route Lafayette to collect them. Those outside Shanghai must entrust their relatives and friends in Shanghai to collect them on their behalf, as the medals are made of bronze and are not suitable for mailing.</p>

<h3>Famous Cartoonist Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Person Who Receives the Most Letters Every Year</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that the cartoonist Luo Xiaoli Bili, author of the comic book "Believe It or Not," has arrived in Shanghai. Some saw him without a hat, wearing a gray coat, with an astonishingly deep green inner garment, paired with a pair of soft-soled, unusual sneakers. Those who did not know him might have mistaken him for an ordinary traveler carrying a hand mirror, rather than the great cartoonist who authored "Believe It or Not," which has been translated into eight languages.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, upon his arrival, he checked into the Cathay Hotel. After settling everything, he went to his "battlefield" to collect materials. He is a carefree person, so all trivial matters enter his pen. He receives the most letters from his "cartoon fans" every year, even more than movie stars. Two years ago, he received no less than one million letters annually.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: The weather is fair to cloudy, with a change in the offing, due to a low-pressure area in central China moving towards the northeast-east. The winds in the Yangtze River basin and south of Ma'anshan Island are gentle and directionless, while there are strengthening southeast winds along the Shandong coast. Also, in the twenty-four hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in Shanghai was 73.4 degrees, and the lowest was 47.1 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 64.0 degrees, and the lowest was 46.8 degrees.</p>

<p>Summary of Key Explanations:</p>
<p>I. The land tax remains at 7 per mille, the general municipal rate remains at 14 percent, and the special municipal rate remains at 12 percent. The increase in the general rate is based on the anticipated development.</p>
<p>I. The wharfage dues have decreased due to the redistribution of the three municipal districts.</p>
<p>I. The expenses for the Volunteer Corps have decreased by a total of over 46,000 taels, with a reduction in salaries and travel expenses, but an increase in ammunition expenses.</p>
<p>I. Police and prison expenses have been saved by a total of over 42,000 taels, mostly due to the reduction in exchange rate subsidies. The salaries can be further reduced by increasing the use of Chinese deputy inspectors in the future.</p>
<p>I. Health expenses have slightly increased due to the opening of new vegetable markets, etc. However, health materials have been reduced by over 45,000 taels, and health subsidies have increased by over 100,000 taels due to subsidies to hospitals.</p>
<p>I. Public works recurring expenses have decreased by over 359,000 taels because over 260,000 taels have been transferred to the extraordinary budget.</p>
<p>I. The music band expenses have been reduced by over 28,000 taels due to savings in salaries, subsidies, and travel expenses, and it is anticipated that the income from performances can be increased. Repair and maintenance costs have also been reduced.</p>
<p>I. Finance expenses have increased by over 6,000 taels, mainly due to the implementation of the Chinese staff savings plan. Materials have increased by over 5,000 taels due to the increased need for office supplies. The budget of the Rates Department is now merged into the Finance Department.</p>
<p>I. The expenses of the Secretary's Office and the Chairman's Office have been reduced by over 14,000 taels due to the reduction in exchange rate subsidies, but the cost of printing gazettes, etc., has increased.</p>
<p>I. The Legal Department has increased by over 15,000 taels due to the improvement of the working conditions of Chinese assistant lawyers.</p>
<p>I. Under the extraordinary expenditure item, the construction cost of over 4.33 million is mostly for the continuation of the projects which have already started, and is essential. The expansion of the police station and prison are especially important.</p>
<p>I. One hundred and fifty thousand for purchasing land is for road repair of the temporary expenditure.</p>
<p>I. For the recurring expenditure of education expenses, western children's schools increased by over 40,000 taels and Chinese children's schools increased by over 140,000 taels. For extraordinary expenditure, the East District Chinese Children's Primary School construction costs sixteen thousand five hundred taels, and the West District Chinese Children's Primary School construction costs twenty two thousand seven hundred taels.</p>

<p>Income (including 1930 surplus), 17,066,605 Taels</p>
<p>Expenditure, 16,715,099 Taels</p>
<p>Balance, 351,506 Taels</p>
<p>Extraordinary Expenses</p>
<p>Expenditure, 18,284,587 Taels</p>
<p>Income (including previous year's surplus), 17,772,287 Taels</p>
<p>Deficit, 512,300 Taels</p>
<p>The amounts by which various expenditures exceeded or fell short of the budget are as follows:</p>
<p>Volunteer Corps, Short 12,634 Fire Brigade, Short 3,292</p>
<p>Police, Exceeded 42,432 Health General, Short 3,203</p>
<p>Health Subsidy, Exceeded 59,859 Public Works, Short 1,263,588</p>
<p>Music Band, Exceeded 18,084 Library, Exceeded 1,232</p>
<p>Education, Exceeded 19,768 Education Subsidy, 20,154</p>
<p>Finance Department, Exceeded 20,843 Chairman's Office, Exceeded 1,011</p>
<p>Secretary's Office, Exceeded 31,282 Legal Department, Short 3,071</p>
<p>Chinese Office, Short 1,170 Intelligence Office, Exceeded 6,439</p>
<p>General Expenses, Exceeded 33,570 Interest, etc., Exceeded 106,19</p>
<p>Materials, Short 50,928 Increased Income, Exceeded 1,267,35</p>
<p>Total Still Excess, 38,436 Taels</p>
<p>Key Explanations: The increase in police expenses is due to the lower exchange rate. The decrease in public works expenses is due to a portion being transferred to the extraordinary budget. Most of the increase in education subsidies was used.

<h3>Deteriorating Relations Between the United States and Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Economic Circles Seek to Improve Relations</p>
<p>Germany Has No Intention of Recalling Its Ambassador to Japan</p>
<p>Japanese United Press Tokyo, 2nd - Since the Shanghai and Manchuria incidents, US sentiment towards Japan has deteriorated. The Japanese Economic Federation attempted to send a delegation to the United States to improve Japanese-American relations, but due to the assassination of Chairman Taku Takuma, it was unable to decide on a representative. Recently, Seigo Nosaka was appointed as the new Chairman and will recommend a representative soon in order to realize the planned initiative.</p>

<h3>Four-Power Conference in London</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Be Held on the 6th of This Month</p>
<p>French Prime Minister to Go to England Today</p>
<p>Reuters London, 2nd - Authorities announced this afternoon that a meeting will be held at the Foreign Office in London to consider closer economic cooperation between the Danube states.</p>
<p>Havas London, 2nd - French Prime Minister Tardieu and Finance Minister Flandin will go to London tomorrow, where they will first exchange views with British cabinet members on the issue of Central European economic organization in preparation for the four-power conference.</p>
<p>Reuters London, 2nd - British Prime Minister MacDonald left London today to go to the palace to visit the British Emperor. It is widely believed that he will report to the Emperor on the status of the Danube conference. MacDonald told reporters that the National Government has been able to achieve its original goal, which is to balance domestic income and expenditure. Therefore, MacDonald can now shift his attention to a larger area. The British government has developed a complete program to ensure that Britain can establish an unprecedented European economic cooperation foundation in various aspects throughout history. This issue will be discussed at this week's meeting between the British and French Prime Ministers. Italian Foreign Minister Grandi is also planning to come to England to participate in the four-power conference on the Danube issue between Britain, France, Italy, and Germany. The German representative is German Chancellor Brüning. The final goals and interests of each country may conflict with each other, so it is still questionable to what extent the four-power conference can proceed. Italy and Germany are currently seeking substantive direct concessionary rights. Even if France joins the Danube League as the protector of the Little Entente, it may not be acceptable. It is rumored that France intends to preserve its interests in the economic union on the one hand, and to set up barriers to defend against Russia on the other. Therefore, the preliminary meeting between the British and French Prime Ministers is highly valued, as it may delineate a path that other countries can safely follow.</p>
<h3>French Budget Approved by Parliament</h3>
<p>Stopping the Clock to Comply with Constitutional Requirements</p>
<p>Poincaré Given an Annual Pension of 200,000 Francs</p>
<p>Agence Nationale, Paris, 1st—Today, the two houses of the French Parliament passed the budget for the fiscal year 1932, with estimated revenues of 41,100,883,494 francs and expenditures of 41,097,701,752 francs. Parliament has now adjourned and will reconvene with the newly elected members on June 1st after the House of Representatives elections.</p>
<p>Agence Nationale, Paris, 1st—The French budget was passed slightly after noon. The revenue exceeds expenditure by approximately three million francs. However, according to the French Constitution, the annual budget must be passed by the end of March. Therefore, at 11:55 pm last night, the French Parliament stopped all the clocks inside and outside the venue. Thus, although the actual passage time was twelve hours after the legal deadline, it is still recorded as March 31st in official documents.</p>
<p>Agence Nationale, Paris, 1st—Before adjourning today, the French Parliament passed a special grant to former President and Prime Minister Poincaré, an annual pension of 200,000 francs. This is because Mr. Poincaré has always been upright and honest in his official career and has no private savings. After retirement, he has been self-sufficient. Recently, he has been unable to practice law again due to illness. Therefore, a special pension is granted to recognize his virtuous and laborious service.</p>

This order also states: Chen Yi, concurrently serving as the Director of the Ordnance Department of the Ministry of Military Administration, has submitted a request to resign from his concurrent post. Chen Yi is permitted to resign from the concurrent post. This order also states: Hong Zhong is appointed as the Director of the Ordnance Department of the Ministry of Military Administration.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Telegram from Guangzhou: To all newspaper offices, for your information, by order of the National Government, Wu Chaoshu is appointed as the Chief Administrator of the Qiongya Special District. This order, etc. Upon receiving this, Chaoshu complied and was sworn into office in Guangzhou on March 28th, and will proceed to Qiong to assume his duties. I believe that China's weakness is due to both the numerous foreign aggressions and the failure to improve the political system. The failure to improve the political system is mainly due to the nationwide economic difficulties and the impoverishment of the people's livelihood. Therefore, to resist foreign aggression, we must improve the political system, and to improve the political system, we must pay attention to the economy, because the economy is the background of politics. History is full of examples, and it is not difficult to examine. Today, the number of people employed nationwide is limited, while the number of those waiting to be employed is infinite. Those who have talent and intelligence but cannot find a way to show themselves, and whose depression is not relieved, will become resentful and resort to reckless actions. The larger ones will lead to internal strife, and the smaller ones will also be enough to make the political situation unstable. In society, from the intellectual class to the porters, everyone is struggling to make a living, running around for food and clothing all day long. Unfortunately, if they encounter internal strife, foreign aggression, floods, droughts, and natural disasters, the number of unemployed people will increase, and the means of livelihood will become narrower. Capitalists are afraid of losing their funds and keep them tightly locked up, while farmers and workers are scattered and unable to resume their businesses in time, leaving profits abandoned on the ground and power unable to be exerted. If this continues, I am afraid that public and private sectors will be swept away. This is truly a major problem for our country and cannot be ignored. Furthermore, most of the communists are forced to take risks due to the pressure of livelihood. If we do not start from the economy to open up a way for them to make a living, but rely solely on military force to eliminate them, it is only like ladling soup to stop boiling, which is not a fundamental solution. Therefore, Chaoshu believes that the urgent task today is to enable people to obtain decent employment and barely maintain their livelihoods, so that there can be talk of reorganizing the political system. In the past, Confucius answered Ran Qiu's question with "enrich them first, then educate them." The Premier has repeatedly enlightened us on the Principle of People's Livelihood, and his intention is probably in this. Qiongzhou Island is isolated overseas, surrounded by strong neighbors, and plagued by communists for many years, with the people's livelihood withering. It is not easy to stabilize the interior and resist foreign aggression. Chaoshu bears this heavy responsibility and feels inadequate. However, he is not one to fear difficulties and seek a life of ease. He is willing to work hard at the grassroots level in Qiongya, developing the local economy on the one hand to alleviate the people's suffering, and establishing a clean and honest government on the other hand to seek political reform. In addition, he must do his best to prevent foreign aggression and restore law and order. He hopes to achieve some success and contribute a little to the party and the country. He also hopes to receive timely guidance so that he can follow it. He is extremely fortunate. Wu Chaoshu, Chief Administrator of the Qiongya Special District, respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Indian Public Opinion Strongly Sympathizes with China</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports from Bombay that although India is currently facing turbulent times, ordinary Indians are paying close attention to the Shanghai Incident. Indians clearly express sympathy for China in this Sino-Japanese dispute. The newspapers' tone is clearly against Japan, wholeheartedly sympathizing with China. Headlines generally refer to the Japanese as "Japs," denouncing them as aggressors. Conversely, any heroic act by China in defending its territory is lavishly praised and intentionally described. The League of Nations is ridiculed for failing to prevent the conflict in the Far East. Headlines such as "The League of Nations Serenely Discussing While Shanghai is in Dire Straits" are frequently seen. It is also predicted that the Disarmament Conference will end in failure.</p>
<h3>Local News Roundup</h3>
<p>Wujiang: Since the outbreak of war in Shanghai, enemy planes have been flying over to scout every day. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, another Japanese plane flew from Suzhou, flying very slowly, circling the city once, and then flew towards Jiaxing.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: The Jiaxing County Government has received an order to collect special national crisis donations. The method is to levy 20% on amusement parks, hotels, restaurants, electricity, telephones, house rentals, steamships, trains, etc., and notify the relevant establishments to implement the collection starting from April 1st. However, amusement parks and hotels are complying with the order to collect the special donation from the audience and passengers. Restaurants, on the other hand, have been experiencing sluggish business due to the national crisis. If they collect the special donation from customers again, it will have a significant impact. Therefore, they have jointly submitted a petition to the county chamber of commerce to be forwarded to the authorities, requesting a flexible approach, such as each restaurant paying a fixed amount per month, so that both public and private interests are benefited. As for house rentals, poor households will be affected by this, and their daily lives are already struggling. They will definitely be unable to pay the special donation. They have requested the township offices to forward a petition to exempt poor households from the special donation to show compassion.</p>
<p>Nantong: The banditry flames in the counties north of the Yangtze River are raging again. Qinzao Town, five miles from the city, was looted by bandits on the morning of the 31st. The bandits called themselves the Red Army and carried guns. The military police stationed in the city went to suppress them, but the bandits had already gone far away. Thousands of bandits are in the coastal area and are being suppressed by the military police. Currently, the stationed troops are solely responsible for the defense of the river. The bandit troubles in Tonghai and Qi counties are being handled by joint defense guerrilla teams formed by the counties. Maritime patrols are being carried out by the provincial security guerrilla team and the various teams of the Fourth District of the Water Police.</p>
<p>Gaoyou: Wang Guangfa, a farmer from Wangjiaxia, Gaoyou County, is 67 years old this year. He was extremely indignant at the invasion of our country by the brutal Japanese. He committed suicide by drowning himself in the river the night before. His family found a note on his pillow, which read: "Japan is attacking our country. I don't want to be a slave of a conquered nation. I'd rather drown myself first."</p>
<p>Qingjiang, Huaiyin: The rickshaw donation is set at 40 cents per month per rickshaw. It used to be contracted by merchants. Since the Public Security Bureau directly collected it this year, there was a wave of donation increases. Later, the rickshaw pullers not only could not afford the increased donation, but also had difficulty paying the original amount. Therefore, they went to the Public Security Bureau a few days ago to petition for a reduction of 20 cents per month per rickshaw. The Public Security Bureau asked the county to reduce it by 5 cents per month. The rickshaw pullers were dissatisfied. On the 26th, they gathered more than 1,000 people again to petition at the Public Security Bureau. They clashed with inspectors Wang Chengen, Chen Guanggong, and patrolman Hua Bingsheng. The situation was chaotic for a while. Inspector Zhang Quan went to the county government to ask for Captain Fu to suppress the situation. At the same time, Liu Dingxin, a standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, also went to the scene to mediate. Around 9:00 p.m., the rickshaw pullers gradually dispersed.</p>

<h3>Li Liejun's Talk on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Claiming "One Plan Benefits Three Worthies"</p>
<p>Luoyang Correspondence: Your reporter, noting that Mr. Hu Zhantang recently published important remarks on the current situation, in which the point of coexistence of various parties was of great concern to the people, specifically visited Mr. Li Liejun, a member of the Central Committee, to ask for his opinion on Mr. Hu's remarks, as Mr. Li is the strongest advocate of party politics. Mr. Li spoke eloquently and at length. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>I heard about Mr. Zhantang's proposal for the coexistence of various parties earlier, and I only saw it yesterday. Mr. Zhantang has a very long history in our party and participated in the revolution very early. He participated in the Chaozhou Huanggang Town South Pass and Guangzhou New Army Uprisings. With his deep experience and rich research, he has long become a seasoned politician. Examining the national system, observing the people's hearts, and weighing the changes in the world, it is appropriate for him to have this proposal. Mr. Zhantang's proposal has two important points: namely, freedom to form parties and opinions on the National Crisis Conference. Now that the government has decided to earnestly protect the people's freedom of rights, people in the country can freely organize political parties. Now that we have realized that human rights cannot be abandoned again, and the declining trend can only be reversed by the efforts of the whole country, rising up vigorously, and establishing numerous groups, although the names are different, the study of politics is the same. The general trend is that whether or not to display the political party signboard is actually irrelevant to gains and losses. The most important thing is that local governments can earnestly protect the people's freedom of rights and that the people can respect their innate human rights, in accordance with the central government's resolutions. The First Plenary Session had a detailed debate, and the reason why the word "political party" was not specifically mentioned is that the political party is already included in the assembly and association. Regarding the proposal for people's representative organizations in the First Plenary Session, there were originally three types: one, the National Representative Assembly proposed by Zou Haibin and others; two, the National Salvation Conference proposed by Wang Jingwei and others; and three, the current National Crisis Conference. Among the three proposals, the National Representative Assembly is the most valuable because its powers are similar to the House of Representatives in various countries. The National Salvation Conference is second, and the National Crisis Conference is next. The members of the National Crisis Conference are not elected by the people, and the conference itself seems to be lacking in perfection. The powers are also too general, leading to speculation from the outside world that the government is acting perfunctorily, and some mistakenly believe that the members are mostly puppets of the government. In fact, the government is acting with utmost sincerity, and the members who are hired can also be called upright citizens. However, whether they are acting with utmost sincerity and not perfunctorily, and whether they are upright citizens and not puppets of the government, can only be seen during the meeting. If so, then the first and second items of the three things mentioned by Zhantang are of little concern in the current situation. However, the third item, which states that the government shall not propose motions or participate in opinions, and that the members should propose opinions on the manipulation of past meetings and the meeting situation, and the resolutions should be handed over to the government for execution, is most appropriate. I believe that the most important thing for this discussion is to focus on politics and fundamentally decide the major plans of the country. It is up to the government and the members to approach it with the spirit of facing the national crisis together. The only thing is that our party's advocacy of democracy did not start today, and Mr. Zhantang is not the only one who advocates the implementation of civil rights. Mr. Wang Jingwei is also a strong advocate of democracy. If you examine his writings and discussions in Wuhan, Beiping, Guangzhou, and other places over the years, you can know this. In this Second Plenary Session, I listened carefully to his speeches, which rarely deviated from the scope of doctrine. The separation of military and civilian governance mentioned in the proposed administrative policy also shows an aspect of improving politics. Although it was unable to break the environment and resolutely implement it due to the current situation, and the plan for the realization of all-people politics has not yet been determined, there is still hope for slight progress in politics. The outside world thinks that the brains of the party's important figures are clear when they are in opposition but chaotic when they are in power, which is just a deliberate mockery. Also, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek has been in charge of everything for years, and it is difficult to take care of everything. Now he is solely in charge of military affairs and is more than capable. It can be asserted that if politics does not get on track, it will be difficult for the country to stabilize in the end. In terms of status, the people's hopes for the gentlemen are very great. If they cannot follow the trend of the times and realize all-people politics to comfort the world, they will inevitably make a mistake. The road ahead is not far, and it is not too late to catch up and catch up, which depends on one thought. In the past, Yanzi killed three soldiers with two peaches. I especially want to benefit three worthies with one plan.</p>
<p>The reporter then asked, "You have strongly advocated the implementation of all-people politics, but how can this save the country?" Mr. Li said, "The national system and the political system cannot be ambiguous, because that is where the people's hearts lie." (March 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Secretly Transporting Handguns and Other Contraband</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported that the Special Higher Police Division of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department recently detected a secret handgun smuggling gang in Japan, which specializes in secretly buying handguns from overseas and returning them to Japan to supply the assassinations of blood-oath violence gangs. After a thorough investigation a few days ago, dozens of criminals, including Tokujiro Tanaka, were arrested, and dozens of American Colt-style six-shot, eight-shot, and twelve-shot handguns were seized. According to the Criminal Investigation Division, Yoshiko Hashimoto and others specialize in selling opium and secretly transport large quantities of opium from Manchuria, Shanghai, and the United States to sell throughout the country. Inspector Meiga also found out about this and arrested six gang leaders, including Hashimoto, Sugimoto, Maruyama, Endo, and Ochiai. In other news, a smuggling gang secretly transporting alcohol for huge profits was recently busted by the Moji Customs. It was reported that on the 23rd of last month, about 30,000 liters of alcohol were imported from Shanghai and loaded onto a small boat to unload at Hakata Port. The Customs Department discovered this and arrested several criminals, including Ranbu Shirakawa.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Ma Weili Discusses the Northeast Problem and the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Han)</p>
<p>Ma Weili, the chief editor of the Geneva newspaper, has written extensively on the Sino-Japanese dispute, and his attitude is generally fair. His recent article, "Manchuria and the League of Nations," was published in English in London's "China Magazine" and in French in the French "China National Magazine," Volume 8, Issue 34. I am eager to translate the full text for the reference of our countrymen. (1) The various complex reasons for the Manchurian problem. The Sino-Japanese dispute over the Manchurian problem has placed the League of Nations in an unprecedentedly difficult situation, and the complexity of the event is beyond our imagination.</p>
<p>Looking back, the disputes resolved by the League of Nations, such as those between Greece and Bulgaria, Paulie, and Vienna and Prague, were all small countries that were easy to handle. In the case of the Corfu incident, although one party to the dispute was a major power and a permanent member of the League of Nations' Council, the location of the dispute was in the heart of the Mediterranean, close enough to be easily monitored. A slight naval demonstration was sufficient to achieve a satisfactory result. Manchuria is different. It is far from Europe and practically beyond the reach of European land and sea forces. Moreover, both parties to the dispute are major powers, and one is a permanent member of the Council.</p>
<p>Given the special nature of this event, and the fact that the two major powers in the Far East are both seated at the administrative conference table, each earnestly presenting its arguments to the representatives of the other fourteen countries spread around the world, the evolution of modern human relations is also very evident.</p>
<p>The sovereignty and boundaries of European countries are very clear. No country has the right to dispute or complicate the territory of another. Each country knows where it stands and what its power over the territory it occupies is. This is not the case in Manchuria. China's sovereignty is undoubtedly indisputable, but the nature of that sovereignty is somewhat superficial and hollow. Before Zhang Xueliang raised the flag of the Party and the State, whether the Manchurian authorities had actually recognized China's sovereignty was indeed a question. (Note: The author's observation is incorrect on this point.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, Manchuria has a direct relationship with the United States and Russia, which are not members of the League of Nations, for various other reasons. One of these countries has a hostile rather than a benevolent attitude towards the League of Nations. All these points make the League of Nations feel very difficult in practice. If the problem cannot be resolved, the League of Nations is blameless, but there are still reasons for leniency. Therefore, there is much advice around the League of Nations that it should avoid getting too involved in the whirlpool of the Manchurian event. If the League of Nations were to get involved, it would not only feel more棘手 but also gain nothing for the problem itself. However, the League of Nations, faithful to the solemn articles of the Covenant and the spirit of its mission of peace, cannot lightly shirk its responsibility. Therefore, the League of Nations is flawless in undertaking this task. However, the League of Nations, having undertaken this task, should also carefully consider the above-mentioned circumstances so that its actions have a commensurate effect.</p>
<p>If we want to make a fair judgment of the League of Nations, we must assume that the League of Nations did not exist and compare it with the situation we are currently in.</p>
<p>(2) A fair judgment on the League of Nations. The Japanese warlords, after careful calculation, took advantage of the time to launch a swift invasion of Manchuria in a very short period and occupy it permanently. This is an undoubted fact. However, the strength of the Chinese and Japanese military forces is vastly different. China's internal strife is constantly recurring, and the world economy is in such a state of decline that the Chinese government cannot obtain effective assistance from the major powers, even from its closest allies. Looking around the world, there is no serious force sufficient to restrain Japan from completing its plan for Manchuria. This is also what we dare to assert. Chinese newspapers have repeatedly equated Japan's means of plundering Manchuria with its means of destroying Korea. However, without the League of Nations taking action, this parallel view would be even more complete. Manchuria would have followed in Korea's footsteps long ago.</p>
<p>The current situation, although not satisfactory, is different from the Korean era. Manchuria remains legally Chinese Manchuria. The discussions at the conferences in Geneva and Paris have made world opinion deeply aware of the facts that have taken place in that region. If Japan's actions to invade Manchuria were to achieve their goal, they would have to adopt a swift and imperceptible means. If in an era when nations were closed off from each other, there would have been no League of Nations to provide China with a high platform to present the facts, and it would not have been able to attract the attention or indignation of the nations. Then Japan's actions could have been expected to succeed. However, since the disaster four months ago, the Japanese warlords have still not achieved their goals, and it is also extremely difficult to achieve their goals under the scrutiny of the world.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that time is often extremely beneficial to China, so Japan's actions are becoming increasingly difficult. Recent developments have shown that every time Japan takes a tough stance towards China, its exports to China immediately come to a halt, and its economy immediately suffers a major blow, forcing Japan to soften its stance and sometimes fall into a state of self-contradiction. If Manchuria remains under Chinese sovereignty, then Chinese immigrants will far outnumber Japanese colonists, and Japan will never be able to completely take Manchuria for itself. Therefore, we dare to believe that although the League of Nations' handling of this dispute is extremely indecisive, it has indeed preserved Manchuria for China, especially China's face, no matter how it appears on the surface. China's military non-resistance is not only insufficient to show its weakness but also sufficient to show China's respect for international law. Therefore, the Manchurian incident has enhanced China's reputation and diminished Japan's reputation. This is an element of political judgment of this event that we must pay close attention to.</p>
<p>And the resolution of the Administrative Council to send an international investigation team to Manchuria should not be taken lightly either. The members of the investigation team are all highly respected figures around the world. After arriving at their destination, they will make it impossible for the Japanese warlords to complete their goal, namely to annex Manchuria. Some things can be accomplished without supervision, but they cannot be realized under the scrutiny of the world. Regardless of the power of the investigation team, it will pay attention to the legal and political status of Manchuria. The result of its work will be the opposite of what Japan hopes for, and will make China's sovereignty over the three northeastern provinces more solid, less prone to falling into the hands of others than before. This is also to be expected and should not be surprising. (But a puppet state has appeared in the three northeastern provinces, which the author did not initially expect.)</p>
<p>But our emotions cannot therefore recognize that the League of Nations' actions are sufficient. We have long hoped that the Administrative Council would speak to Japan in a particularly loud and clear voice, and do its best to implement all the articles of the Covenant concerning the maintenance of peace. Unfortunately, this has not been realized. There is also a need for in-depth analysis of the various reasons.</p>
<p>(3) The Two Elements of the Manchurian Incident. The Manchurian incident, as presented to world opinion, can be divided into two elements. In fact, there are two disputes. One is that the facts are very clear and a judgment is very easy to obtain, namely the relationship between Japan and the League of Nations. A member state, and a permanent member of the Administrative Council, has violated the Covenant, ordering its troops to cross the location where they should be stationed and occupy the territory of another member state. International law has been clearly violated, so the League of Nations, which is responsible for safeguarding international law, should naturally rise up to uphold it.</p>
<p>But outside of this dispute, there is another dispute, arising between China and Japan. The content of that dispute is ten thousand times more complicated than the dispute mentioned above, and it is even more vague and elusive to those far away. The Japanese accuse the Chinese of violating treaties concerning Manchuria. The Japanese claim that it is necessary to suppress bandits in order to protect their safety. (According to the Northeast, if bandits need to be suppressed, the responsibility lies with China, which holds sovereignty, not Japan.) The Chinese side denies the legality of various treaties, especially the Japanese interpretation of these treaties. We can all have an opinion on the above points, but we dare not say that the solution must be this way, because the solutions proposed by Europeans to the above-mentioned issues are extremely diverse. The difficulties that exist between Japan and the League of Nations are of a nature that is sufficient to unite friends of general peace, while the disputes between China and Japan cause the attitudes of various countries to tend to diverge.</p>
<p>Therefore, the actions of the Chinese representative attending the Administrative Council have been very agile and reasonable, from the beginning in the Administrative Council to discuss these two issues separately, requiring the League of Nations to first fulfill its obligations in the first issue, and reserving the second issue for future negotiations.</p>
<p>Japan, on the other hand, is the opposite. Its words and deeds in the League of Nations Administrative Council, as well as some European newspapers that Japan can instruct, are doing their best to mix the two issues together to make our thinking extremely chaotic. Japan's means have achieved considerable success, which we must admit.</p>
<p>(4) The United States and the League of Nations Shirk Responsibility. The reason why it is so easy to succeed is twofold. The first is the actions of the United States. The Washington government not only has a significant stake in this event, but also bears a serious responsibility. Without the help of the United States, the League of Nations has no ability to act, because every time the Japanese government feels that the emotions of Washington and Geneva are inconsistent, the Japanese government will do its best to resist the orders of the League of Nations. Therefore, from the beginning, it was necessary to make the League of Nations and the United States stand on a common line of action. However, although the United States is extremely sincere in its actions on the surface, it is still difficult to implement. Washington is very ignorant of the elements of the problem and the key to the League of Nations' operation.</p>
<p>Washington is ignorant of the elements of the problem because Japan has a strong representative in Washington. As far as we know, China has no representative. Since Japan has no opponent to confront, the trick of mixing the two elements of the problem is very easy to succeed. Moreover, Washington is completely ignorant of the true meaning of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Recent contacts between the two sides are still not enough to salvage the mistakes of the past, resulting in misunderstandings between the two sides. The representative of the United States attending the Administrative Council has been changed, and the representative's own ignorance has aggravated the ignorance of the United States government. Therefore, although the United States and the League of Nations are very willing to work together and have a very consistent attitude, they have inadvertently created a strange state of mutual restraint and inability to act.</p>
<p>The intention of the League of Nations is very correct, because the League of Nations recognizes that the United States occupies the main position in the interest of this event, so how to determine the scope of action depends on the wishes of the United States. The League of Nations can only give the United States authoritative assistance. The United States government, on the other hand, also has a legitimate intention. It recognizes that the League of Nations is the highest moral force in the world. Since the United States is willing to support the League of Nations, how the League of Nations will act is up to the League of Nations to say. Therefore, the actions of the League of Nations and the United States are wavering. The two sides shirk responsibility to each other, support each other, and the power of the two sides is becoming increasingly weak. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Financial Spot Gold Has Extremely Rich Liquidity</h3>
<p>Many ups and downs during the half-day</p>
<p>Final Calculation Shows a Rise of Four Taels and Six Mace Yesterday's spot gold continued to show a good situation. Although there were ups and downs, there was no special prosperity or decline. Initially, the price rose due to the decline in the silver market, reaching 686.7 taels. Sellers became less active. Afterwards, drafts tended to rise. The exchange rate, such as the US dollar against the British pound, fell again. In particular, a certain bank widely purchased cash, so the market price became sharper, reaching 90 taels. In the end, it turned downward, but it still rose more than four taels compared to the day before yesterday. In the afternoon, the market closed due to Saturday. Looking back at the past week, the price went from decline to rise. The minimum price was 668.3 taels, and the maximum price was 690 taels, with a difference of 21.7 taels. The overall statistical increase was only slight. The market situation yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<p>The range of changes is not very large. The market opened in the morning with a rise of four taels and six mace for May delivery, reaching 686.5 taels. Large silver bars fell another 3/16, and the price of silver fell 1/8, so the market opened high. There were still many buyers. Then, sellers became active. Yuan Mao Yong Kang Xiang Heng Yu Tong Chun and speculators came to sell, and Yingjin Banks made 1.85625 for May delivery. The Dalian Gang sold US dollars for current delivery at 32.5625 yuan, and also settled for May delivery at .625 and .5. The price fell by three or four taels, reaching 83.5 taels around 9:30. HSBC's listing of the forward rate was reduced by .125, but the US dollar fell by .0325 due to the exchange rate, so the listing was reduced by .5 yuan. The price of gold should have increased by 1.5 taels, reaching 85 taels. It was also reported that a certain bank purchased 420 cash bars, or so it was said that it had not been finalized. However, the buyers in the market suddenly became fierce. Gan Chang Xiang Heng Xing Yuan Tai Fu Chang Hong Kang Yong and others all entered, and Mitsui absorbed July US dollars at .8125, and June British pounds at 1.8 half were available for sale. At 10:20, it reached 89 taels. Zhi Feng Yong sold, which was 2 taels less. Suddenly, it rose again. Yi Feng Yong Fu Yu Yu He Fu Tai Heng Heng Xing all purchased, adding up to 89.2 taels in a few minutes. Later, Gan Chang Xiang sold items, Heng Chang Yong sold them, and then cut 4 taels, reaching 85 taels at 11:00. After entering, a certain bank continued to enter 210 bars of spot goods, which were sold by Heng Xing Ying Feng Heng. In addition, Hong Kang Yong Yi Feng Yong Heng Xing Fu Tai Heng and retail short sellers rushed to drag in, so the price jumped by 5 taels, reaching 90 taels at 11:15. However, Shanghai offered recent US dollars at 32.8125 yuan, and Yuan Heng sold items and scattered long positions took advantage of this to sell, immediately depreciating by more than 3 taels, reaching 86.8 taels. In a moment, it increased by 6-7 mace, reaching 87.5 taels. However, buyers were watching, and those who grabbed hats did not leave them overnight. And today happens to be the market holiday, so they had to flatten out. Therefore, the selling positions seemed to be many, falling back by about 2 taels. At noon closing, it was 86.5 taels, continuing to rise by four taels and six mace compared to the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>The posted price is mostly pressed down by 7 taels. According to the largest price of 90 taels and the smallest price of 83.5 taels in the half-day, there is a rotation of 6.5 taels. The posted price was changed to 756 taels, with a pressure of about 70 taels, later to 667 taels, and the result was 69 taels, which was 7 taels more than the previous day. The account was logged at 81 taels to 87 taels. The supplementary water was 81 taels. The early market for items was 86.5 taels, and 87 taels in the afternoon. The bare bars were calculated to add 1.5 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions do not have a consistent trend. According to the transaction statistics on the table, Heng Xing, Shen Kang, Fu Yu, Fu Chang, Hong Kang Yong, and Yu He all entered. Yuan Heng Yuan Tai, Gan Chang Xiang, Fu Tai Heng, and Da De Cheng's receipts and payments were erratic. Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Heng Yu, Tong Chun, and Yuan Kang Xiang all exited. Other numbers are complicated.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn sales plate is tired and the current yarn market situation is abnormally萧条.</p>
<p>The situation in the current yarn market is exceptionally bleak, and various groups show no excitement. This is because there is still no optimistic news about the current situation, and people's hearts are unsettled.

<p>The cotton market is calm, and the trend is still weak. Due to the depression of the world cotton industry, people's hearts are softened. The attitude of various factories to real sales is quiet and cold. Due to the sluggish yarn sales, the intention to purchase raw materials is also weak. However, Shenxin Factory has a slight increase in quantity, and the source from various places is also not prosperous, so the market price can still be stabilized.

<h3>Grain, Thick粳, Rises Suddenly by Two Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source in Shanghai South was slightly sparse, and the appetite of urban and rural shops felt more lively. Because the market has been loose for several days, the cost of this batch of goods shipped to Shen is relatively high. Thick粳xiang Zhuang helped to handle nearly a thousand stones. The market rebounded by three jiao. Early rice was in short supply, and the price also rose by two jiao. Thin rice arrived and sold evenly. The market did not rise or fall. The accumulation of foreign杜尖 was slightly there, and the appetite of the guests was sluggish. The market was soft by a few points. 通變阴化 had no goods to respond to the market.</p>
<p>Currently, there are four rice shops in Zhabei: Wan Sheng Tai, Heng Da, Qing Sheng Yi, and Heng De, renting in the rice market in the south of the garbage bridge. They can formally open for business in about two days. Yesterday, more than a dozen ships came from Suzhou River. The traffic was not smooth. Northern粳early and late rice, high and tight second rate settled. Foreign杜尖 was neither prosperous nor humiliated.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Guest Sales Stalled, Military Rice and 平糶 Rice Went Out Vigorously</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation, guest sales suddenly stalled, the appetite of the street turned to wait and see, the entire city period now various goods all had no transactions, but the market price remained strong, because military rice and cheap rice have been selling vigorously in recent days. About 22,000 bags were transported by road and by ship to Nanjing, Zhenjiang and other ports. All of them are directly loaded by the companies, and the allocation price is similar to the previous market. The companies also loaded more than 2,000 bags themselves and with customers, which were loaded to Hankou and the upper reaches, it was said.</p>
<h3>The Uniquely Large Sales of "Soldier Boat" Flour</h3>
<p>Opening at Tls. 2.005</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot flour market showed a somewhat unsteady buying and selling trend. Because the "Soldier Boat" flour brand, from various northern ports, seemed more dynamic than other brands due to its uniquely large sales volume. It is said that Dalian, Yingkou, and Andong are about to thaw, and sales markets everywhere have begun to operate. Therefore, the "Soldier Boat" flour, priced yesterday, remained active, opening at Tls. 2.005, but still difficult to obtain, as if demand exceeded supply, showing a firm and active trend. Other brands, such as "Red Blue Car," which have been sold at prices comparable to "Soldier Boat" for months, saw less inquiry yesterday, with actual sales requiring a decrease of one cent. The other brands remained similar to before.</p>
<h3>The Steady Rise of "Five Blessings" White Ice Sugar in the Sugar Market</h3>
<p>"Five Blessings" white sugar has been steadily rising recently due to doubled tariffs. Initially, it rose from Tls. 8.90 to Tls. 9.40, and yesterday, it opened at Tls. 9.70, an increase of eight cents overall. It is said that the stock of checked numbers is already low, and this price is expected to stabilize temporarily. The number of unified hand-drawn water patterns is also limited. The factory's own water pattern "Qing" is holding back due to high raw material costs, and all inventory is being watched and not yet sold.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Clearance Sales of Coarse Silk</h3>
<p>Negotiations Between Yellow White Factory and French Firm Fail</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai continued to be dull. The Yellow White Factory and French firm's negotiations failed due to high prices offered by Chinese merchants. Only telegrams were sent. Interest in coarse silk purchases by Indian firms was also weak. Yesterday, only He Xing bought six bales of "Lotus" brand top-grade 28-30 strand, pre-basin, yellow reeling silk for Tls. 560. Bo Xing bought ten bales of "Wei Yi Chang" brand top-grade, pre-basin, yellow coarse silk for Tls. 400. Mei Da bought ten bales of "De He Heng" brand top-grade cotton state yellow silk for Tls. 460.</p>
<h3>Extremely Few Wholesale Transactions of Piece Goods and Woolens</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, the market for woolens has almost completely stalled. Although businesses have universally reopened recently, there are still very few wholesale transactions. Although Tianjin, Sichuan, and Northern gangs continue to restock, most only have an appetite for three to five boxes. The majority of this is "Yuan Chang" blue-grey and plain serge. There are only scattered pieces sold in the streets. Those holding goods all want to sell for cash. As for prices, apart from serge, all other types of woolens have fallen in price. The drop in "Walter" woolen cloth is especially severe. "Walter" checkered, iridescent, and plain woolen cloth, which sold for around Tls. 4 last year, have now fallen to Tls. 2.25.</p>

<h3>The Movement to Reduce or Exempt Rent</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four essential elements of human life. Especially for those living in Shanghai, housing is even more important and painful. Regardless of whether they are scholars, farmers, workers, or merchants, the majority of their daily hard-earned income must be given to landlords. This situation was not only the case during the recent incident, but also before the war in Shanghai, where most of the various benefits of all industries were relentlessly squeezed by landlords. This was originally an abnormal state of social development in Shanghai. Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the heavy sacrifices of residents and shops in Zhabei, Wusong, and other places have not been addressed. Even in the British and French concessions, businesses have been closed for more than two months. Although shops on various streets have gradually reopened in recent days, the market is sluggish, no longer what it once was. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce and other organizations have suggested reducing or exempting rent to maintain the status quo. Recently, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified landlords to voluntarily reduce rent to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. This is the most important and urgent issue in Shanghai today, and it is also a question that should be discussed and studied first.</p>
<p>According to various opinions, there are those who believe that "public institutions that use rent as a foundation should not be exempt." There are also those who say that "if they wish to reduce or exempt rent, tenants should investigate the economic situation of the landlords nearby. There are certainly many wealthy merchants who own property, but there are also those who rent land to build houses, mortgage to build houses, and widows and orphans who rely on rent for a living. This situation is a special organization of Shanghai's economic situation and should naturally be carefully considered." Originally, no matter what is being done, several detailed considerations must be made beforehand, so that there will be no obstacles and difficulties when facing the matter. Similarly, this rent reduction movement cannot escape this rule. On the tenant's side, consideration should be given, and on the landlord's side, consideration should also be given. However, in this world, interests always conflict, and there are rarely cases where both parties benefit. Furthermore, the rent reduction movement is an even more obvious conflict of interest.</p>
<p>In recent years, the continuous rise in land prices and rents in Shanghai has been due to extremely complex reasons, but the general land brokers, those who rent land to build houses, and those who mortgage to build houses are engaging in speculative profits and seeking huge profits, which is also the biggest reason why Shanghai's land prices are rising year by year and the lives of residents are becoming more and more difficult. Under this condition, these people should also bear their due responsibility. Therefore, this rent reduction movement can only seek the greatest benefit for the greatest number of people as a prerequisite. If you must take everything into account and consider everything, I am afraid that nothing can be accomplished in this world.</p>

<h3>Feeling About the National Army's Withdrawal from Song Defense</h3>
<p>— Meng Tiao</p>
<p>In the eighth month of Xinwei autumn, a demon star gleamed its sharp horns. The Ezo (Japanese) arrived in one night, easily capturing Liaoyang. The Eastern Army retreated without a fight, and the enemy's power spread wildly. At that time, I was struck by a strange disaster, and relief for the afflicted was not yet possible. The Huai and Si rivers connected with the Yangtze, and thousands of miles were covered in vastness. Ten thousand wild geese cried into the night sky, sadly searching for rice paddies. Internal strife had not yet ceased, and the North and South still disagreed. The sky of Chu was filled with the atmosphere of war, and the wilderness cried with many wounds. It was like a person depleting their life force, and a hundred diseases attacked at once. The enemy took advantage of the gap and seized everything. How could they not be harmed? Several high-level meetings were held, but party debates continued like cicadas. They only fought the enemy with words, and the paper soldiers were in vain. The beacon fires burned for five months, and the Shanghai Incident erupted in a panic. Warships crossed the sea, spying on my inner chambers. The national policy was once again mistaken, and a single mistake turned into a collapse. First, the enemy sent a letter, setting a deadline for the withdrawal of Song Defense. Generals Chiang and Cai, filled with righteous indignation, touched the sky. They tore up the letter and shouted loudly, "My people, do not panic! We can still destroy the enemy. Let us tell you the details of the past." At twenty, I learned swordsmanship; at thirty, I personally went to war. I once hunted in Cangwu and defended the entire city in one battle. I first went on a northern expedition, and I laughingly recovered Hengxiang. Breaking through bamboo, I went down the middle stream and attacked Wuchang in the dark of the moon. Again, I chased Sun En, and the remaining rebels cleared Yuzhang. This autumn, I subdued the State of Xing, and the Red Eyebrows scattered at the news. All of this is trivial and not enough to glorify the banner. Try my hand at slaying whales, and it seems enough to overturn Fusang (Japan). My military uniform towers like a mountain, and brave soldiers flank me on both sides. Looking at each other, we all wept, generously pouring out our hearts. Ten thousand hearts united as one, vowing to defend our territory to the death. We completed our walls and fortresses, gathered our dried provisions and grain, and poured our last drop of blood onto the crimson battlefield. The bloody wind rolled up tiger teeth, and the sound of the horn was desolate. Just a moment after dividing the troops, they suddenly rushed like running dogs and sheep. The enemy flags stretched across half the sky, and the flames burned Kunlun Mountain. To the west, the Song River was cut off; to the east, it reached Jiangwan Village. It was the time between winter and spring, and the cold air filled the vastness. Across the river, the warship rumbled. Who built the dragon bridge? Ten thousand cannons fired at the high bank, and the river water rose and fell. The thunder car rolled across the earth, its power like a long snake. The starry raft ran through the Big Dipper, and the nine heavens were as smooth as a thoroughfare. Fireballs hurled through the clouds, and a loud noise collapsed like thunder. Breathing smoke or forming a formation, the sun and moon were hidden. Poison was spread across the wilderness, and breathing caused harm. Three routes coordinated an attack, and the six directions were plunged into darkness. The general stood in the fire, calmly explaining to the children. He said, "Who is not afraid of death? Follow me to drive away the jackals." How could the jackals be afraid? The brave soldiers all soared like dragons. The three armies advanced in formation, vying to capture the king of the bandits. Lightning suddenly pierced the sky, and the warship turned to ashes in response. The ground shook and the pillar of heaven collapsed in the center. A hundred tiger warriors appeared, each with a divine appearance. They bared their chests and exposed their red shoulders, their hair blue and tangled. Some were painted ugly with indigo, and some had melon-shaped cuts of cinnabar. Their screams were like the cries of ox-demons, and their swiftness was like apes and deer. They changed into various forms, forgetting life and death to face the enemy. Silver dragons overturned tiger dens, and rolling knives were like frost. With my flesh and blood body, I destroyed their strong iron armor. Since the spirits and monsters of the world do not fight, the enemy was already stiff. Eighteen or nine out of ten fled, abandoning their armor and running away. The turtle-like soldiers complained of their slowness, and their short feet hated the earth. They turned their swords to fight each other, and metal clashed. The broken spirit of Yamato (Japan) could not return. There were also many traitors who acted as ghosts for the tigers. The eradication of evil must be thorough, and the accumulated corpses were higher than the walls. Returning, they straightened their ranks, each with thousands of wounds on their arms. They captured countless soldiers, piled up like mountains in carts and boxes. At first, they broke the Yunzao Creek, and the rats did not dare to be mad. After the victory at the Temple Town, the arrogant arrogance was restrained. Do not say that there were no men in Qin (China), but these are the true pillars of the country. Cheering voices rose from ten thousand mouths, and they poured wine on the road. The three armies were even more grateful, and they were so honored to be entrusted with the country. They were expecting to sweep away the spears like lightning in no time. How could the army on the wall be indifferent? The enemy reinforcements came one after another, and my reinforcements watched empty-handed. The disparity in numbers was already great, and the rice was as vast as a granary. They also knew that there was no hope of luck, and they dared to avoid fire and soup. They resisted for thirty days, and the fierce battle darkened the sky. The enemy army changed commanders three times, but they never dared to attack my sharp edge. Suddenly, they changed their plans, patting my back and strangling my throat. The isolated army fought hundreds of battles, and more than half died for the country. The rear reinforcements still did not arrive, and it was difficult to do anything with my arms. At midnight, the thieves launched a major attack, and their power was like toppling mountains. The rear continuously reported alarms, and the enemy captured Liuhang. Fighting hard was not impossible, but dying in vain would not save the situation. The whole army began to retreat, and the sound of the drums was not raised. Alas, the achievements of the bloody battle were thrown into the vastness. The isolated loyalty in heaven and earth is enough to revive the country. When the soldiers left, the enemy massacred the village, and the fish in the pond all suffered. They slaughtered my chickens and pigs, and bombed my halls and chambers. They rummaged through my refugees' chests, and stripped the clothes of my women. The barbarian songs flew like the wind, and they marched to Nanxiang in one night. At that time, I was a guest in a lonely pavilion, and I heard the news and wept. Since the coast had fallen, the southeast had lost its protection. If my reinforcements watched again, they would take over Suzhou and Hangzhou. Gentlemen, holding the scales of the country, there must be a way to resist the enemy. Watching the fire across the river, the deep enemy did not know to resist. Even if the covenant under the city has not yet been made, the crime has already been difficult to measure. Now that the leaky boat has been plugged, what has been lost can still be compensated. I present this poem as a statement of guilt, wailing and crying out to heaven.</p>

<h3>Talking Film</h3>
<p>— Nai Zheng</p>
<p>Since talking films were shown in the United States, it has not taken long to sweep the world. Major theaters in Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and other cities in China have also been showing them for more than two years, creating many talking film fans. Shanghai's Mingxing Film Company was the first to record talking films with Baidai (Pathé) Company, but the audio was recorded on wax records. Tianyi Film Company spent a huge price to purchase a full set of recording equipment from the United States, along with photography, sound recording, and film developing technicians. Two films have already been released, using sound-on-film. Later, Mingxing Film Company did not want to show weakness, so it spent a large sum to purchase sound recording equipment that can capture natural color. Today, talking films have become so advanced; whenever there is a good film, we all rush to see it. However, very few people know how it is made and how it works. Now, I will briefly explain the simple principles and the steps from recording to screening.</p>
<p>Briefly, there are two ways to produce sound in talking films. One is to use phonograph records similar to those used in gramophones, so that when they rotate, they are paired with the projector. This is called Vitaphone. The other is to use the sound waves from the light strip on the edge of the film, which is called Movietone. Vitaphone was invented by the American eccentric Thomas Edison in 1894. The sound is recorded on a round piece outside the film. When it is screened in a theater, a gramophone is used to produce the sound, and the sound is amplified at the same time. An electric wire connects it to the speaker behind the screen, and then the music and speech are emitted from the speaker. The trouble with this method is that the timing of the sound recording and the photography must be extremely accurate. Even when screening in the theater, it must be tested and corrected in advance. The small motor that turns the gramophone and the motor that turns the film must have appropriate speeds, so that the sound and movement are in sync. If the two sides do not match, or if a few feet are cut off in the film, then we will see the lips of the actors moving, but the sound has not yet come; the piano cover is not open, but the melody is already sounding. This leads to many jokes. This is the weakness of Vitaphone. Other problems, such as unclear sound, the noise of the wax record rotating, or the fine lines on the sound film becoming flat after being screened many times, causing the sound to be blurred, all make viewers dissatisfied. The Shanghai-screened "Singing Girl Red Peony" uses this Vitaphone sound. However, everything must improve. The Movietone, which is now popular, can avoid this problem.</p>
<p>Movietone was created by American Dr. De Forest. At that time, European countries also had various inventions for talking film equipment. But the one who should be most thanked is Mr. Rumer, who invented the method of photographing sound waves as wave patterns. Now, the ones that can make talking films even more advanced are the photoelectric cell and the triode vacuum tube. All talking films must use these to increase their effectiveness. The photoelectric cell can convert sound waves into corrugated lines and photograph them on the edge of the film; the triode vacuum tube is like the vacuum tube we see in radio receivers, which is needed when recording and playing sound. The above two devices are the most important components of Movietone.</p>
<p>When recording talking films, sound and light are equally important. The actors' actions and speech must also be noted at the same time. While filming, the microphone picks up the sound. The microphone is the same as the one used for radio broadcasting, but it is more refined. Once the sound enters this device, it is amplified by the amplifier. (This device is also used for wax record recording; it is also indispensable for screening; and amplifiers are also used in radio broadcasting and receiving machines).</p>
<p>The current formed by the sound wave after passing through the amplifier is then sent to a bulb that can change the light source. Therefore, the changes in the intensity, strength, thickness, and fineness of the light in the bulb are sensed on the side of the film, forming short, horizontal stripes. When the stripes are very thin, the sound is high and sharp; when they are very thick, the sound is low and dull. When screening, this photographed film must pass in front of the photoelectric cell. The current from the photoelectric cell passes through the amplifier and is amplified; then it is sent to the main amplifier and sent to the speakers behind the screen, transmitting it to the ears of the audience. The expressions seen by the audience's eyes also match the sound and speech. This is the key point of Movietone's superiority over Vitaphone.</p>

<h3>The Cultivation of German Aviation Talents</h3>
<p>— Qiu Xing</p>
<p>After the defeat in the war, the German people worked very hard for all kinds of revival undertakings. What we have seen is obviously a great progress: the most admirable thing is that they have plans, organizations, and research for all kinds of revival undertakings, which are thorough.</p>
<p>Today, the development of German aviation is truly astonishing. However, since the restriction of military preparations, military flights have been prohibited. Therefore, those experienced flying warriors who had fought hundreds of battles in the European War have also moved from military aviators to civilian aviation. Since civilian aviation received their help and contribution, it has progressed more powerfully than before. However, how can these advanced and excellent aviators exist forever? Sometimes, unexpected dangers are unavoidable, so new aviators have emerged. The people who guide the aviation industry in Germany use the most real and thorough methods to guide these new talents. Because of the development of the German aviation industry, there is a great need for these new talents, so they do not hesitate to invest huge sums of money as a cultivation fund.</p>
<p>Any young person who aspires to become an aviator must first pass the preparatory examination of a simple aviation school. After passing, they can enter the National Aviation School. The National Aviation School has subjects such as flight techniques, engines, aviation, radio, and international law. They must also learn two or more foreign languages. The school also has teachers to teach flight mechanics, and wooden and steel aircraft are studied separately. The examination is very difficult. The tuition fee is about 15,000 national currency.</p>
<p>However, the most noteworthy thing is that students only bear 3,500 yuan of this fee, and the rest is borne by the Han Cha Aviation Company and the government. Students who graduate from this school can work as second-class aviators at Han Cha Aviation Company, but they must fly at least 40,000 kilometers. Later, outstanding aviators will be successively promoted to formal aviators. The initial salary is about 1,200 yuan per year, plus 1.5 pounds for each kilometer flown.</p>
<p>Just by looking at the method of cultivating German aviation talents, we can see the goodness of their foundation. Therefore, from this good foundation of revival undertakings, we can infer the essence and progress of all German postwar revival efforts. (Reprinted)</p>
<h3>Market News</h3>
<p>Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Company informs that Liangdan produced by Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Company can promote digestion, sterilize and disinfect. During this summer season, regular use can prevent epidemics. Therefore, sales have been very good recently. The company, except for the second branch on Sichuan Road, which has not opened due to the impact of the war, all other branches, including the main store on Simalu, Tianhougong Bridge, and Xiaodongnan, are now operating as usual.</p>
