<h3 id="c1">歐洲經濟之新趨勢　仁 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>大戰告終。世界消費力重振。各主要資本主義國家及初期資本主義後進國家之生産力。一時咸呈亢進之勢。但日久終以世界購買力復衰。販路梗塞生産過剩。而造成今日世界經濟之恐慌。</p>
<p>大戰以還。後進國殖民地及半殖民地資本主義化之結果拒絕先進國之輸入。以縮小其販路。或實行高率關稅。以保護自國産業此世界生産力亢進後販路梗塞之一原因。再橫跨歐亞之帝俄。向爲資本主義國家商品銷賣地自蘇維埃政府成立以後。已不復可爲資本主義國家榨取之對象。此世界生産亢進後販路縮小之第二原因。又大戰後。世界嘗有一度通貨澎漲時代之出現。在此時期中。幣價下落。中産階級無形中失其貯蓄。勞働者實質的生活貧困。其後至生産亢進期中。以産業合理化而减低工。銀同時俸給者亦以國家財政之不足而减低收入。於是遂造成大衆普遍的貧乏此世界生産亢進後購買能力減退之第三原因</p>
<p>此種販路梗塞之結果。遂形成國際貿易之激减。及倉庫中滯貨之增高考。最近五年來世界未銷却之商品。已較前約增二倍至五倍以上。</p>
<p>最近在歐洲方面。以上述國際貿易不振及輓近通貨動搖之原因。已實行物物交換之原始的商業形態。據歐洲傳來之情報。謂德國勃累門地方。已成立物物交換之（國際貨物淸算公司。）以獸皮羊毛烟草敷物染料與埃及丹麥交換棉花小麥此外在法國巴黎。亦有銀行業所組織之（尼頭加國際商品貿易公司成立。并註册於瑞士政府。以工業品與美國巴西日本交換小麥棉花咖啡織物。且該公司除工業品農産物交換外。更實行商品與證劵之交換。最近聞尼頭加公司已與美國輸入業者。交涉以美國之證劵交換法國商品。</p>
<p>夫今日世界經濟恐慌之侵襲。其　結實在於生産力與生産關係之矛盾。然此現象之發生。斷非出於偶然。而此現象之消滅。更斷非用（頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚）之方法所得奏功。此已爲識者所共信。故前述歐洲之激變的經濟趨勢。固爲目前不得已之救濟策劃。然結果是否可以澈底挽救建築於私有。</p>
<p>財産制度上之資本主義經濟的頽勢。吾人不欲妄加斷語。但在此新趨勢之。</p>
<p>下。資本主義未來之運命亦。可約略測之矣。</p>

<p>全國各路實行負責運輸南京通訊、記者近以鐵道部整頓全國路政、其着手之第一步新設施、即爲實行各路負責運輸、爲欲明瞭此種設施之性質起見、特謁該部業務司司長俞棪、承其將此事之内容見告、談話如下、（記者問）何謂負責運輸、（答）臂如鐵路運貨、自貨主將貨交到車站、請求代運、經鐵路接受時起以至鐵路將貨物運至目的站、將貨交與收貨人之時止、其間凡鐵路運送貯藏之際、其貨物遇有損失、除非不可抗力之天災人禍外、皆由鐵路負責照價賠償、而且貨物可在預訂之時間内、運到目的站、决不延誤、此即所謂貨物負責運輸、歐美各國皆採用此項制度、我國各路、僅膠濟北寗綫曾經試辦耳、（問）現行之貨物運輸方法如何、（答）現時我國鐵路、通行一種不負責之運輸、商人交運貨物、累月經旬、不爲運送、往往霉爛變壞、或發生偷竊、即幸而運送、而途中之偷竊與裝卸時之碰撞、使商人時蒙重大之損失、商人血本所在、多視路運爲畏途、多轉趨水運、而轉運公司遂乘時而興、蓋轉運公司以代客運貨而略取回佣爲營業、倘辦理得法、原可與鐵路並存不悖、惟現時之轉運公司、以鐵路運貨不負責之故、乘機壟斷、對於客商欺剥詐騙、譬如商人有貨若干、欲由鐵路運送、直接委託鐵路、則恐運送無期、又恐遭受損失、以爲轉運公司自行派伴押送、可以無損失之虞、惟轉運公司、則故意居奇苛索、運費竟有高於鐵路原訂運費數倍以上者、商人欲免意外損失、又求速於運到、祇有不惜重資供其敲吸者、至於價値較低之貨、商人不堪路運之損失·與轉運公司之苛求、寗任其擁塞於出産之地、不願外運、以致形成現在全國國民經濟之枯窘之現象、鐵路貨運凋落、商塲經濟恐慌、國計民生、遂直接蒙其不利之影響、而轉運公司獨享厚利、此鐵路現行運輸方法、有亟加改良之必要也、（問）辦理負責運輸、其效果在鐵路方面有無確實把握、（答）實行負責運輸、能一反鐵路現時貨運之積弊、已如上述、至其確實效果、姑以北寗路辦理成績證明之、民國十七年北寗路爲吸收貨運起見、與四洮等路辦理聯運、但因北寗當時對於貨運不負責、所有四洮等路運出貨物、百分之九十九仍爲南滿路所吸收、至十九年底、北寗公布實行負責貨運、當日即有已託由南滿轉運之貨物六百餘車、臨時改走北寗路、而北寗路在去年除九一八事變以後不計外、僅九個月之間、單就負責運輸之十一站而言、已增收入三百三十萬、初步辦理、其收效之宏已如此、倘全國各路踵行、假之時日、其效果如何當可想見、（問）實行負責運輸、於現有之轉運公司其影響如何、（答）轉運公司之本義、係與鐵路相輔而行、在鐵路方面、倘轉運公司能爲鐵路招徠貨物、則鐵路</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>對之、自無歧視之理、但轉運公司肆意敲剥客商、以致貨運不能暢通、鐵路間接受其害、故不能不籌自救之策、而實行負責運輸、但轉運公司今後能採薄利主義、代客運貨、祇略取回佣、不再妄肆苛求、則將來鐵路貨運、必驟感繁盛、而在貨主心理、但得轉運公司代運、除免各種手續、則小費原所不惜、轉運公司正宜利用此種心理、减輕回佣、則其營業當更蒸蒸日上、正毋庸以鐵路實行負責貨運而引爲杞憂也、最後俞司長又言、鐵路實行負責運輸、受其利者不止鐵路貨商與轉運業三方面而已、即民生經濟、亦受其益、蓋貨物流通、供應相應、則國民生計、不致如今日之窮促、又商人託運貨物、取得鐵路發給之提貨單、因鐵路負責之故、此項提貨單、即等於貨物之價値、可以向銀行押欵、資本得以周轉、商塲經濟、藉以活動、故實行負責運輸一事、實有白利而無一弊、甚願藉報端宣揚之力、使社會人士對於鐵路當局此種嶄新的措施、輿以同情也云云、</p>

<h3 id="c103">國民體育實施方案草案（一） <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>國民體育實施方案、係全國體育會議籌備會請吳蘊瑞袁敦禮郝更生三君草擬、將提出大會討論、茲將草案錄下、　　｜目錄｜一、引言、二目標、三、行政及設施、（一）行政及組織系統、（二）設備、（三）經費、四、推行體育方法、（一）研究工作、（二）人材之養成、（三）體育實施之標準、（四）提倡及獎勵各種體育集會及組織、（五）體育之考成方法、五、分年實施計劃、</p>
<p>（一）引言凡欲解决一問題、須先認淸問題自身之意義及範圍、而後方能論及解决方法、體育二字之意義在各種不同時代不同社會中甚有出入、且一般人心目中之體育各有不同之見解、如不先將其意義閘明、範圍劃淸、率爾規定其實施方案、不但着手之時無所適從、卽實施之後、難免結果與始願相違、至爲危險、故於草定此方案之先、不得不將體育之意義及範圍略爲申述之、體育二字自常人視之不過爲身體之鍛鍊、第自生物學心理學發達以來、傳統之心身二元說旣不能存在、且近代敎育之目的并非只爲知識之供給、而爲整個機體生活之訓練、於是吾人始深切明瞭、體育之表面雖爲大肌肉活動、但由此以引起生理上心理上之變動甚多、而爲整個機體生活訓練必不可少之方法、故體育之意義非僅身體之鍛鍊、乃從身體各種大肌肉活動中供給敎育之機會之謂也、換言之、欲達到敎育上之各種目標、身體活動乃爲一主要之手段與方法、機體之發育與健康之促進、爲身體活動必然之結果、體育不僅達此目的、尚有其他敎育上之重要目標如社會道德、基本生活技能、善用閑暇之方法、公民必具之態度與能力、無不能藉各種身體活動以訓練而培養之、故體育與敎育不能分之爲二、所不同者、體育只以身體大肌肉活動爲達到敎育目標之方法、而敎育所採用達到其目標之方法、除體育尚有他種而已、因此、所有體育之設施均須以能達到整個敎育目的爲標準、同時凡非以身體大肌肉活動爲敎育方法者均不得謂之爲體育也、爲對於體育範圍明確認識起見、以下數點不得不於此處說明之、</p>
<p>（一）體育與軍事訓練　軍事訓練之目的、爲供給國民軍事知識、訓練國民禦侮之能力、及培養國民民族之意識、現在各級學校之軍事訓練習注重步兵之操演、且因敎練殊欠嚴格、不獨眞正軍訓之目的難達、卽盲從命令不畏死之士兵亦不可得欲達軍事訓練目的、一方面須力求科學與工業之發達　社會與經濟之安寗與穏固、一方面除於國民相當年齡予以嚴格澈底軍人生活之訓練外、必須於無形之中多方培養民族意識、及禦侮能力、學校之中各種學科均須以此爲目的、尤以歷史·地理·公民等科爲最有效、至於體育乃爲供給國民充分發育之身體、勇敢機敏之精神、無形之中對於達到軍訓目的有重大之供獻、自不待言、若認步兵之操演爲體育以之爲軍國民訓練之主要方法、則謬誤孰甚、故本方案除對於軍訓有間接供獻之體育自身的價値外、整個軍訓之各方面政府另有辦法、無牽涉之必要也、</p>
<p>（二）體育與衛生及健康敎育　一般人因體育之能促進發育及健康、遂常認體育爲衛生之一部、或以衛生爲體育之一部、實則二者各有其範圍不能混而爲一也、從社會方面言之、衛生爲政府重要職權之一、包含醫藥之供給、環境之改良、疾病之預防、民衆之衛生訓練與開導等項之設施、從學校方面言之、健康爲敎育目的中最重要之一項、包含健康之保護與視察、環境衛生之設施、適當之衛生敎學等項之設置、健康爲生活之要素、而敎育須與實際生活有關、舉凡一切學校内之活動與設施均不能無健康敎育之意義及成分、體育旣屬學校内學科及活動之一、對於健康敎育自有相當之供獻、體育之必然結果爲促進機體之發育與健康前已言之、此卽其對於健康敎育之最大供獻、但除此必然之健康結果外、體育尚有其他對於敎育之主要供獻、况體育之組成分子純爲大肌肉活動、健康敎育之組成分子、所有學校之活動與敎學均含有之、故體育與健康敎育雖同屬於敎育範圍内者、實則大有區别也、本方案只能於體育範圍内立論、不涉及衛生及健康敎育也、</p>
<p>（三）體育與勞動　體育旣爲大肌肉之活動於是常有人認爲與勞動相彷彿、甚有主張以勞動代體育者、殊不知二者之目的及意義均不相同、勞動之目的爲生産、體育之目的爲敎育、勞動之於兒童時有戕賊身體之害、故未成年之兒童不宜勞動、早爲社會學家及敎育家所公認、體育則爲發育身心之唯一工具、若以有生産之勞動代替兒童之遊戯與運動、其剥奪兒童發育與敎育之機會、未有甚於此者也、勞動爲成人之工作、體育則爲娱樂、工作固爲生活之必要、而適當之娱樂亦爲生活之不可無、况體育所欲達到之各種敎育目標如前所述者、均非勞動之所能達故主張以勞動代體育者、實過於崇信工利主義而忽略體育内之各種敎育意義也、</p>
<p>（四）體育與童子軍　童子軍本爲訓練靑年戰爭時充當斥候之技能　繼漸發展成爲有組織的多方的靑年訓練、其主要内容爲予靑年與自然界及社會實際接觸之機會、以培養對人對物之種種生活技能與正當態度、其組織之方法則純爲學校課外活動　、如此學校敎室内所學者、於此課外設計中宣習之、故童子軍實爲一整個敎育設計、另達其特殊之目標、體育不能代童子軍　猶童子　之不能代體育也、至於童子軍所練習之種種身體活動與技能測騐、固非與體育無關、因其爲整個之敎育設計、自不能不採取許多體育活動與材料、但此種體育之活動與材料自應與學校體育課程有相當之聯絡、不待言矣、</p>
<p>（五）國術在體育上之地位　國術爲我國民族固有之身體活動方法、一方面可以供給自衛之技能、一方面可作鍛鍊體格之工具、不獨在民族史上有其固定之價値、卽從近代科學如解剖生理等方面觀察之亦未可厚非、發揚之、研究之、實爲今日之必要、但學術無國界、人類之天性中外無不同、凡不背科學原則及能適合人類天性之種種體育活動、均應按照國内社會狀况一律提倡之、不應以其發源之地點不同而有所軒輊、故國術實爲體育活動之一種、不能因其爲我國所固有者而予以特殊之地位、以捐棄其他合乎科學及敎育之體育活動也、另一方面言之、學術旣無國界則我國之國術固應力謀其在國際間之發展、不應以之爲奇貨可居、觀乎日本之柔道近且爲歐美許多人士所學習、况我國國術之奥妙、遠在其上乎、至於國内體育家對於國術應加以深切之注意與研究、而國術家應對於近代體育及其基本之學科、亦須有相當之認識、此實爲發場及研究國術之必要途徑、</p>
<p>（二）目標（一）供給國民機體充分發育之機會、（二）訓練國民隨機運用身體以適應環境之能力、（三）培養國民合作、圍結、之精神、（四）養成國民俠義勇敢之風尚、（五）養成國民以運動及游戯爲娱樂之習慣、</p>
<p>（三）行政及設施（一）行政及組織系統我國體育中央行政除敎育部之社會司主管民衆體育外、毫無其他固定行政機關、因之各種體育設施旣乏有系統計劃自難有良好之效果、國民體育法雖經立法院頒佈、但至今未見施行、無論其是否適宜、早等於具文矣、根據上述體育之意義及範圍、及參考我國中央行政之組織、在敎育部内設一體育委員會統理全國一切體育行政、實爲今日之必要、舉凡中央一切關於體育之行政、均須經此委員會通過方爲有效、庶幾全國體育得以整個的一貫的及有計劃的發展、但委員會須網羅全國優秀體育專家組織之、不能常川駐京、只能有定期之集合、故須另有常川在敎育部内執行委員會之决議案者、因此在敎育部内須設體育督學一人司此職務、至於中央民衆體育場按这事理應歸敎育部社會司主管、應卽移交、以謀事補之統一、茲將委員會組織大綱草案及中央行政系統表列後、</p>
<h3 id="c104">體育委員會組織大綱草案 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>

<p>八十一（七十三）　我不耐老是做啞吧子，現在是我開口的時候了。我說（白燒白煤而不工作的馬力還多着咧。二百六十萬兵便是三十二萬五千匹不事生産的馬力。一千四百三十多萬的先生學生便是一百八十萬匹不事生産的馬力。城裏一千六百萬的太太，小姐，少奶奶又是二百萬匹不事生産的馬力。這四百多萬匹馬力眞奇怪，他們不做工作倒要燒外國上等煤炭！我主張要太太，小姐，少奶奶，先生，學生，兵士自已織布自已穿。這裏面是含有兩層重要關係。（一）自已織布自已穿是一個富有意義的運動。買來的粗布不肯穿，自已織的無論多麽粗，穿在身上都覺得比錦繡還漂亮，因爲牠是自已的勞動力的結晶。（二）穿了自已織的布便自然而然的把洋貨抵制掉了。）唐先生說：（這倒是很有意思。）朱先生：（這可說是一種不得而已主義，因爲不如此便要亡國滅種。）我說：（仔細考察起來，自已織布自已穿，並算不了一件什麽難事。每人平均一年穿十丈布。每丈布約須紗一斤光景。算他三天紡一斤紗，一天織一丈布，四十天便完全告成。農人有五個月空閑取牠四十天，還有一百一十天幹别的事。兵士每天少上一小時的武八股就行。太太，小姐，少奶奶，每天少打兩圈馬將也得了。先生學生呢？費他半個暑假，或是一個寒假總不能算是躭誤他們的蛀書生活吧。）唐先生說：（有人發明了一種手工紡紗機，每天每人可以紡兩磅多紗，不過紡出的紗粗細不匀，所以已往是失敗了。我看你們是不在乎美觀，何妨用這種紡紗機試一試。如果行得通，紡一天織一天便可出一丈布，豈不便利得多？）朱先生說：（這是很好。要費心請你介紹一架。我們可以把這種紡紗機加以研究改造，若能使牠出紗粗細均匀那就好了。總之，我們願意試他一試。）</p>

<p>但汪態度堅决不允打消辭意</p>
<p>各代表嗣分向中央及蔣報告</p>
<p>唐有壬晋京報告後昨已返滬中央對於行政院長汪精衛之辭職、注重蔣委員長之意見、仍極力進行挽留、但連日各方代表、除於汪抵滬之第三日、曾一度與之正式會晤外、餘均由汪夫人代表接見、直至昨日、宋子文·何應欽·朱培德·三代表、始與汪氏作第二次之會晤、結果據談、汪辭意現仍未打消、但認汪氏爲勇於負責之人、日内定有適當辦法、</p>
<p>二次晤汪挽留　連日經中央及蔣委員長何應欽·宋子文·宋培德三氏、與汪精衛夫人陳璧君女士晤商、並由汪夫人將何宋等意思、轉達於汪氏本人後、汪氏意似稍動、因相約於昨日下午作第二次之正式會晤、及至下午、汪首先於十二時三十五分、回蒲石路寓次等候、宋何朱三氏、遂於下午二時二十分、同至汪宅訪汪、時汪夫人陳璧君女士亦在内、三代表當再懇切向汪挽留、並請從速晋京復職、汪態度依然堅决、並認爲本人之辭職、係剷除不負責軍人之最好辦法、故已决心犧牲個人之地位、以完成軍事上之統一、嗣經宋等再三勸其復職、汪終於不允打消辭意、最後各代表再請汪氏對中央及蔣委員長等之希望加以愼重考慮、至四時許、遂仍無結果而散、</p>
<p>分函京漢報告　宋何朱三氏、自汪宅辭出、即同至祁齊路宋宅磋商、决將晤汪情形、分向中央及漢口蔣委員長報告、并交換下次應如何進行挽留汪氏之辦法、至四時四十五分始散、</p>
<p>何應欽氏談話　據中央代表何應欽氏晤新聲社記者云、今日（即昨日）爲第二次與汪院長會晤、各方代表、對汪仍極力進行挽留、汪氏現對辭職之意、仍未有打消表示、但先生係一勇於負責之人、余（何自稱）想在最近數日内、總又有相當之辦法、至提前召集三中全會事、本人未有所聞、想不至有此舉、至回京之說、一二日内、恐尚不能即成行、</p>
<p>甘乃光之談話　内政部次長甘乃光、於前晚由京到滬、即於昨晨往訪汪氏、旋向新聲社記者發表談話云、中央對解决汪院長及張主任之辭職事、現仍未决定何種辦法、要當以蔣委員長之意見爲重、現蔣氏所表示者、旣如唐有壬回滬後所述、是以各方代表、恐仍將極力向汪挽留云云、</p>
<p>德領探詢政情　汪辭職後、我政局之發展、各國均頗重視、除上次美意兩總領事一度訪吳市長探詢外、昨日九時半、德總領事阿倫堡伯爵、亦往市政府訪吳市長、探詢一切、吳當告以各方對汪仍在積極挽留中、不日當可解决、政局無甚問題云、</p>
<p>于唐等昨來滬　中政會秘書長唐有壬·晋京報告後、已於昨晨與監察院長于右任等、同乘京滬夜車來滬、昨晨八時許抵埠、于唐二氏抵滬後、即分别回寓休息、唐氏曾略進茶點、即往謁汪報告、至于氏此來、聞係專爲醫治胃病及脚氣、故對政治不擬發表任何意見、</p>

<p>公共租界英商中國公共汽車工人罷工後、公司昨仍設法維持通車、工人原定昨晨向公司示威、因天雨展期、一面擴大罷委會組織、發表告工人書、公司今日實行雇用新工、形勢依然嚴重、茲錄詳情如下、</p>
<p>嚴密戒備　公安局六區警署、公共租界戈登路捕房、爲防範公共汽車罷工工人示威運動、於昨晨特派大批武裝探捕、分駐康腦脫路公司附近、戒備甚嚴、罷工委員會、以昨晨適天下大雨、當命令全體工人展期示威、改在仁和茶樓召集大會、到工人一百七十餘人、當時議决、（一）以天雨關係、改派代表四人、前往公司談判、（二）倘談判無效、决定於十四日全體參加武裝糾察隊、實行武力攔車、驅逐白俄、（三）不達到目的、誓不甘休、</p>
<p>保護通車　公司昨日設法由檢查查票代替售票工作、勉强行駛、公共汽車一路十四輛、二路七輛、五路七輛、九路二十四輛、及專軍特别快車、由公共租界捕房通知中西探捕、沿途嚴密保護、及晚幸未發生衝突、昨日上干、康腦脫路公司門首、突來自稱失業華工四十餘人、要求公司予以工作、廠長兼車務總管蕭達特當飭印捕驅逐、旋卽散去、</p>
<p>擴充罷委　罷工委員會、昨對新聲社記者正式發表云、當時公司爲和緩工人空氣、曾指定工人六名、組織代表團、商議增加工資、此次罷工委員爲十二名、公司指定之六名代表在内、自罷工後提出辭職、今日開大會時、曾提議撤職、旋往議决、再補充罷委五人、并堅持反對一切工賊走狗搗亂、對於市黨部派員準備出任調解、因此次罷工、係工人與資本家直接問題、反對任何人調解、决用羣衆自已力量、方能爭得勝利、</p>
<p>雇用新工　英商中國公共汽車公司、對於罷工工人、採用强硬政策、已宣布將罷工者革職、凖備雇用新工、昨日、廠長蕭達特、已雇用一批華工、定今日上午、集合於南京路外灘、由公司駛出定備車一輛、載往康腦脫路公司内訓練、預定最短期内、設法恢復各路公共汽車、事前並與公共租界捕房商妥、届時由捕房增派武裝探捕、隨車保護、並在南京路外灘嚴密戒備、以防羆工工人阻止、</p>
<p>黨政態度　市黨部對於公共租界英商公共汽車公司售票員罷工爲明瞭眞相起見、確曾派員調查、但市社會局并未派員調查、外傳昨日該局派某君到仁和茶樓及前日派朱某會同市黨部調查、均非事實、該局對於此次罷工、至昨日止、并未有何表示、</p>
<p>公司表示　英商公共汽車公司昨公表云、此次售票員突然罷工後、罷工工人總數、售票員三百零一人、高麗查票四十八人、開車銅匠掃地查票華人小工等均未波及、至於罷工工人迄今并未正式向公司提出條件、現公司已經董事會議决、宣佈將罷工者革職云、</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>凡是會說會話的婆娘，肚皮裏都有一部俗語大詞典，引用時候，異常貼切，說好，便在一句俗話上，說壞，也在一句俗語上，只須俗語記的多，說來說去，便可辯才無碍。</p>
<p>稱贊貌醜的人，道一句：貌醜夫人相。但是對於貌醜的心存鄙夷，只消道一句：醜人多作怪。說個個菩薩都是一般的，只須說：千佛萬佛，總是一佛。說個個菩薩都不是一般的，只須另引一句，呌做：各廟各菩薩。</p>
<p>勉勵下流社會中人，引用一句，好漢不怕出身低，假使</p>
<p>憎厭下流社會中人，便該說：茅柴窠裏不出好蟲豸。譏笑一般刻薄成家者，總說：無義錢財湯澆雪，假使替他們辯護，又該說：義不掌財，可見做財主的，實在不需要這個義字。　說人慈善不得，便可說：人善易欺，馬善易騎。說人不妨慈善，又可</p>
<p>說：人惡人怕天不怕，人善人欺天不欺。</p>
<p>同是引用俗語，爲什麽有這絕不相同的方案？我有一比，宛比船上的櫓，九曲三灣的水程，憑着船上的櫓，搖到這邊，又可搖到那邊。</p>
<p>船的櫓，便是人的舌：櫓是扁的，舌頭也是扁的啊！說好，說壞，只須使用這三寸紅色的櫓。</p>

<p>迄今。尚不滿十年。今則風行蘇常一帶。銷路日廣。不獨爲吾鄕一小工業。且儼然在國貨中占一重要地位矣。然滬上雖服用者已多。而知其來歷者尚少。亟誌數語。以當介紹。亦提倡國貨之一端也。按江陰珠羅汗衫。係以方格珠羅紗製成。此項珠羅紗。原爲吾鄕馮氏所發明。其初市上並無發售。後試以裁製汗衫。購者竟紛至。遂從事大規模織造。成本亦漸减輕。其初最上等者每件需價一元二三角。今則六七角可矣。購者以其價廉。且係細線織成。堅牢之程度。竟可與錦綸汗衫相埓。而價値則僅及三之一耳。式樣係對襟。穿着亦極便利。以是莫不爭趨焉。江陰珠羅汗衫。由此遂一躍登於市塲。其初僅馮氏獨家發售。二三年後。驟增至三四家。今行銷蘇常一帶。年可數十萬件。進步不可謂不速。惜遠地尚少知有此項汗衫。一時未能普銷全國。故余樂爲介紹。望國人一致起而提倡。倘有大資本家願投資此項事業。則其前途。必更有望也。茲更述一汗衫逸話。以結余文。年前。江陰有縫人某。知新都中尚無此項汗衫發售。乃獨購數百件。捆載入京。冀獲大利。詎入京後連朝陰雨。汗衫半漬。又因京中未知此物。購者竟寥寥。而資斧已罄。困居旅邸。無以爲計。　日。過市上。遇雨。避立市肆簷下。肆中主人問所售何物。曰。江陰汗衫也。主人以素未前聞。請解裝以觀。且問價幾何。曰。衣半漬矣。願貶價售焉。肆主曰。果爾。余將悉數買之。某大喜。即理其裝。漬者幾何。折價若干。餘悉如價。交旣定。某再三謝而去。肆主乃將所買汗衫。一一重加整理。然後出售。購者</p>

<p>— 勞人</p>
<p>今年天災人禍。接踵而至。浙西各縣。皆發生搶米風潮。其勢不可嚮邇。來時老嫗千百。成羣結隊。呌囂勒索。雖武裝實彈之軍警。亦無法加以制止。蓋民間之痛苦。實已陷於水深火熱。呼籲無門之情况。故不惜挺而走險。耆紳褚輔成（</p>
<p>慧僧）先生。目睹桑梓之浩刦。大發慈悲。鳩某紳商組織貧農借米會。搶掠之風。或可因此老之登高一呼而稍戢乎。</p>
<p>借米會設嘉興。由縣長主幹。籌集欵項。購米借與鄕民。其出借辦法。最多每人以一石爲度。立有字據。約定秋收償還。褚老以本人常川駐滬。故慨認採購委員。僕僕滬杭道中。殊引以爲樂。自謂替十數萬嗷嗷待哺之災民。做　次米買辦。此種美差。誠無上光榮也。昨日借米會又有巨欵匯全浙公會。託褚老採購小絞米一千石運禾。褚遍赴各米行細心比較米價。如此公者。可謂急公好義矣。</p>
<p>八月二日係借米之一日。褚老因方爲子女謀嫁娶。未能趕到參加。由縣長派員監視指導。軍警蒞塲糾察。秩序井然。鄕</p>
<p>農扶老携幼。蜂湧而來。自上午九時起至下午三時止。計借五斗者七百六十三户。六斗者一百八十五户。四斗者一百六十户。共計五百五十六石五斗</p>
<p>在此借米聲中。尚有一事可紀者。即某米商竊盜餉米五十石、爲借米會發覺。先是滬戰爆發時。各界募集捐助十九路軍餉米數百石。旋以該軍開閩。中止運滬。該項餉米。即託某米商保管。現奉令改充借米之用。迨派員前往點騐時。竟發現每石缺少若干。合計五十石。如此米商。未免喪心病狂。太無心肝矣。</p>

<p>讀了自由談冉公（改行當）諧文，突梯渭稽，妙語解願，具見冉公代人籌謀的熱心。可是黨國要人只使下野，也不失作富家翁，</p>
<p>或暫做出洋的游歷家，何至於開荐頭店。至於敎員，只有小學敎員，十數元一月的東　；官立的學校，也許要枵腹從公，欠薪到三四月之久；實際，倒不如水門汀上告地狀的朋友。可是大學裏的敎師，抱了皮包，東西兼課，每小</p>
<p>時以四五元計算，月俸兩三百元，不足爲奇，那裏肯在水門汀上告地狀呢。不過在目下失業呼聲甚高的時候，做小百姓的，委實應該未雨而綢繆，不可臨渴而掘井；所以在下不妨來補充一下。</p>
<p>（一）商人　現在百業凋敝，民生顦顇，那一件事情可掙錢！那一件事業不破産！想來想來，只有一事可舉辦，保你立刻發財。而且名目，</p>
<p>又好聽，又光樂。你道爲何？原來是市上所有的商店，立卽關門，改開銀行；那末，元寳滾</p>
<p>滾自來，豈不是發財的捷經麽？所以上海的商人，無論剃頭司務，呌賣朋友，煙兌店夥計，都有開銀行的格資，做銀行家的可能，尤其是錢莊的老闆夥計，搖身一變，都是銀行專家，金融巨子呀。</p>
<p>（二）學者　學者而開（子日店），做敎育家，已是學者的末路了！我想；現在的學校，多帶（旅館化），校長譬如旅館老闆和經理；敎員譬如旅館的茶房；學生很像賜顧的旅客；所以敎育家一旦失業、不妨開辦旅館，一定是斵輪老手，游刃有餘，保你生意興隆。</p>
<p>（三）醫師　藥店夥計做國醫，國醫交運開藥店，這是誰都知道的。不曉得醫生尚存一個最好的副業，一定可以發財掙錢，萬無失敗的　險</p>
<p>，你道何事，原來便是開棺財店。</p>
<p>（四）華人　從漢奸，奸商，没心肝的人這樣多我便想到我四萬萬同胞倒有做亡國奴的資格！</p>

<p>— 特</p>
<p>雅浦島者。位於赤道北數度加羅林羣島之一也。歐戰後。由國聯委託日本代管。島民好勇鬭狠。其文身之體。創痕斑斑。望之可畏。加羅林羣島。乃珊瑚化石或玄武岩所組成。而其西四百哩。有巴洛島者。則爲火山化石。昔有人駕獨木舟至該島。携石歸。衆見其色與本島所産者。完全不同。大以爲異。此在何代。無從稽考。雅浦島土人向以物相貿易。至今仍有多處襲行此習。迨巴洛島奇石運至。需求日盛。此石旣無悅目之色澤。復不能以製裝飾之器用。不知島民何以愛</p>
<p>之若斯。嗣有人以石易貨。久之。遂成交易之標凖。而成一種貨幣矣。其初採運者。多屬碎石。厥後愈採愈大。近年運來之石。有大如磨船或車輪者。而厚薄不一。所以貴其巨且重者。蓋可免盜者挾之而走出。石皆鑿成扁形。中有孔。貫以粗竹。二人持其端。由石礦輪盤達海濱。石巨。獨木舟不能勝。則繫諸竹筏。曳行四百哩。而至雅浦。遂可用以貿易矣。島民之所以用爲貨幣者。非以石質之可貴。特以採運之不易耳。採石者往往遇風舟覆。或溺於洶濤。或葬身魚腹。有時竹筏沉没。或因石重難曳。斷繫棄之。致離家數月。備嘗艱險。徒手而返。懊喪欲絕。然竟有智者。思一巧法。以慰若輩。苟採石者能證明確曾駕舟外出。採石巴洛。運抵海濱。失於中途。則其人雖未挾石</p>
<p>歸。而衆仍認爲享有所失之石。如存欵於銀行者然。蓋所失者。僅無用實質之物。而其得石之辛勞。依然存在。因石之價値。亦得諸辛勞也。簡言之。卽所以承認其以辛勞與勇敢所獲、而復因天禍。不得享有之財産也。此項承認。秉命於島長。第無書據。僅賴口傳。自得累代承繼。如實産然。凡一石或所失石之享有權。並得轉讓。亦憑島長以腦力記之。近者日人曾以錢幣輸入雅浦。加以</p>
<p>雅浦與巴洛間。月有汽船往來。需時不足兩日。於是雅浦之貨幣問題。遂爲一變。第錢幣雖便。島民殊不樂用。今除與官府往來外。復襲行以物易物之舊習。巴洛雖已無石運至雅浦。而土人户外。仍時有大小之石。倚於前側。且仍有以石爲貨幣者。日代管政府嘗施行法律。凡契約。悉須至</p>
<p>官府註册。聞近有一島長以數代襲傳所失石之享有權。授其嫁女。曾遵律至官府註册以爲信。無何。新夫婦以此虚有之石購一椰子植塲。復至官府註册過户。島民於小貿易。則仍用得諸新奇尼島之貝殼爲貨幣。而有定値。第貝殼與石不同。色澤可愛。且可用製裝飾品。失貝殼者。不能如失石之得享虚有權。亦所以避煩瑣也。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>今天已是八月十四日了，去市敎育局通告開學之期，已經不遠，做父兄的，又要籌劃一票敎育經費，送兒女去入學，我因此算算兒女的學費，與讀書的時間，</p>
<p>小學且不去算，我來算中學大學，中學每學期一個學生的學膳宿三費，至少須八九十元，多至一百餘元，此外還加書籍零用洗衣等費，每學期須一百五二元左右，這種學生，還算不得特别的揮霍，至於大學生呢，天然更要加一些，每學期非二百元不辦，因此一個學生，初中三年，高中三年，須要一千八百元，方能買到一張中學畢業文憑，若加大學四年，又須一千六百元，方能買到一張大學畢業文憑，倘兒童不肯用功，或資質愚魯的，尚須留學不計外，則一個學生，讀到中大學畢業，須三四千元，這樣貴族化的學堂，有幾個人讀得起書呢，</p>
<p>父兄出了這樣大的一票敎育經費，我再來算學生讀書時間，一年之中，年假約放一月，春假約放一星期或十日，暑假又放兩月或兩月有餘其餘如星期日放假，各種紀念日放假，或開運動會等又要放假，除頭去尾，每年至多讀六個月書，名爲中學大學讀書十年，其實眞眞讀書祇有五年，這還不算眞眞野鷄式的學堂，不幸而遇着愛國運動，學堂風潮，此種臨時的荒費學業，尚未打入賬内，</p>
<p>所以一個學生，讀到國内大學畢業</p>
<p>，連六年小學學費，須洋四千元，出洋留學，更談不到，假定你有三個子女，非一萬二千金讀書費不可、假定有四個子女，非一萬六千元讀書費不可，試問這樣的讀書，父兄還担負得起麽？</p>
<p>因爲學堂收費之鉅，與利息之厚，於是野鷄式之學堂，亦如雨後春笋，校長只知進賬，不管學生的學業，多放一天假，就多供給他們的一票飯賬，做敎員的，恐慌飯碗的不穏固，專門敷衍學生，不敢去認眞一些，因此名目雖爲大學畢業生，而中文不通者有之，不能寫一封英文普通信者亦有之，試問這樣的敎育，安得而不破産呢？</p>
<p>人家因子女讀書而破産，學堂因敎育腐敗而破産，尤其是一般政客，往往利用靑年的盲從頭腦，以爲爭奪傾軋的利器，因此學堂的風潮愈弄愈多，父兄化了偌大金錢，而學生不肯專心讀書，專門搖旗呐喊，以作無謂之奔走，噫，人心如此，尚有何言，中國如此，尚有何藥可救，我只有如讀陳委員的演說詞，末脚一句完了，</p>

<p>— 輔民</p>
<p>（一）明信片印像法　明信片印像法頗多，其最簡單者，莫如燈光紙造成之明信片製之，此法余常彷行，頗見良效，是等明信片不可見光，故平常應用黑色紙包紮，及需用時，乃擇煤油燈旁，離燈四五尺無强光直射處，展開紙包，覆模片於上，襯大木板其下，更用竹片四條夾其二邊，（或照像廓亦可），斜置於離燈五六寸處，使受光約一分鐘後，開放竹片，取出此紙，是時紙上並無影像，必浸顯影液中數小時後方現影，現後用淸水洗淨，浸入亞硫酸納水溶液中，（Ｓｏｄｉｕｍｓｕｌｐｈｉｔｅ）（亞流酸納一分水十分合成）約十分鐘取出，待乾重入水濡之，乃貼於淸潔之玻片上，徐徐乾燥，</p>
<p>乾後即可剥下，至是攝影明信片成矣，　　（二）茶壼印像法　用毛紙刷去四周之汚洉，將動物膠（煎煞動物皮骨而成的膠）徐徐塗其上作椭圓形乾後，再加硝酸銀液（硝酸一分和水九分）一層，乃取模片置於塗液上，用線縛緊，橫置日光中經一分鐘後像即顯出，而後取出模片用毛刷蘸淸水多量，洗滌壼面，迨有白霧發生時，乃用水洗盡，以硼砂水和錄化金水濡潤之，則影呈赤褐色，迄變紫色時，更用水洗之，像始固定其上，徐徐乾燥可也，凡碗盆等磁器質之品均可用此法爲之印像，惟磁面爲圓形或凹凸不平者，則難行之以模片不能密着其面，致顯像必難明瞭也，</p>
<p>（三）手帕印像法　法將手帕（除毛巾外各種手帕皆可）浸入肥皂水中，洗去油垢，乾後用筆蘸硝酸銀液（Ｓｉｌｖｅｒｂｉｔｒａｔｅ）塗其面，法無一定，或作圓形，或作椭圓形，或作方形，多角形，或塗於一隅，或塗於正中，俱無不可，惟塗量貴均，不宜偏，塗後置暗處陰乾之，晒印時，取黑色堅密之紙，中剪方圓等孔，隔於模片與手帕之間，同入曬印夾中晒之，俟顯影像已深，乃取手帕依茶壼印像法處理之，惟一切洗滌等事，均宜浸入液中而行之，</p>

<h3 id="c212">廢除烟酒賭博爲酬酢 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>人與人之間互相發生了關係，由習俗相傳，每逢婚喪喜嫁等事，必致禮應酬，於是生人家必籌備烟酒招待客人，而賭博中最普遍的麻將，在酬酢中也是不可缺少的應用品了，改良酬酢，已有</p>
<p>本會同志提議，而這副屬品的烟酒賭博等惡習慣，更刻不容緩的廢除，</p>
<p>茲略分述其害如下。</p>
<p>（一）烟　在平常朋友往還，授受一枝香烟，比什麽都普通，並且國人我可以說每個人都能夠呼呼，但是香烟裏含有尼古丁，不特有刺激性，還容易傷肺部，在吸的時候，雖然並不感到什麽，但是年深月久，爲害匪淺，在酬酢塲中更預備大烟，照主人家的心理，是玩玩而已，但是吸大烟的爲害，當然盡人皆知，並且犯法（在非正式鴉片公賣之前，</p>
<p>我還能這樣說。）</p>
<p>（二）酒　和香烟一樣，幾個朋友相遇，可以拉上高長興或馬上侯買醉，有事的人家，必强賓客再乾一杯，其害也如</p>
<p>上述，目今許多影片中，更敎會纨袴子怎樣去破壞女子的貞操，如（有夫之婦）</p>
<p>中的李寳珍，（失足恨）中的落霞是，影片有巨頭的表演，天然社會上也有這類事實發現。</p>
<p>（三）賭博　我特别提出的是麻將，麻將是我國的國粹，現在歐美也風行一時，以爲能打麻將是時髦的事，家庭中有兒童的，啓示兒童以僥倖心，使他小小心靈中深影了賭博一會事，婦女們更有樂此不倦，而破壞家庭快樂的，致於破家蕩産，也意料中事。</p>
<p>所以本會員特提出，以供討論，並</p>
<p>賜指敎。</p>
<h3 id="c213">男女平等的問題 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 振</p>
<p>男女平等的問題，好像已經解决了吧！不然，何以好久不見討論呢？本席所以提出這個問題來請大家討論，就是認爲男女平等的問題，還是一個懸案，并未解决，諸位若是不相信，請看看下列的事實，</p>
<p>先從舊式女子講起，所謂舊式女子，就是指的那些未曾讀過洋八股，學過摩登化，而尚信仰着三從四德的婦女而</p>
<p>言，她們還是抱着在家從父，出嫁從夫，夫死從子的舊觀念，過着糊裏糊塗的生活，眞是古人所謂不知有漢，胡論魏晋，一切的一切，都是依賴着男性，當然說不到男女平等了，</p>
<p>舊式女子還是男子的奴隸，是事實，無庸諱言，再看看新式女子怎樣呢？所謂新式女子也者，當然是指着那些讀過洋八股，擅長摩登化，極信仰婦女解放（？）萬歲的女子而言，她們是讀過洋八股的，會寫些（親愛的哥哥）（我最最親愛的）（我的···）等肉麻信兒，會說些（ＭｙｄｅａｒＩｌｏｖｅｙｏｕ）（Ｋｉｓｓｍｅ）·····）等富於誘惑性的話兒，天天過着醉生夢死的生活，衣啊，食啊，住啊，用啊，都是男性們的供給，還是依賴的生活啊，同舊式的女子所不同者，舊式女子須管理家事，不會遊玩，而新式女子可以不管家事，盡情享樂，前者可說是男子的奴隸，後者可說是男子的玩物，總之，都不是人，不是與男子平等的（</p>
<p>人）</p>
<p>更有一種新式女子，可說是新式女子的别派，當然這派女子也是讀過洋八股過的，不十分摩登，曉得要與男子平等，非謀經濟獨立不可，於是也在社會服務，據有相當的職業，這派女子思想新極了，不｜生産，難免做男子的奴隸，摩登化，成爲男子的玩物，｜要生産</p>
<p>，可是所賺來的錢，是自已的，家庭的</p>
<p>負擔，還是推在男子的身上，偶而丈夫</p>
<p>所賺的錢不敷用，或是失業的時候，需要女的帮助一點，則此種女人認爲是對男子的恩惠，并不是應盡的義務，不摩登出去難見人，摩登化又成爲男子的玩物，於是想出一個折衷辦法，｜非讀過洋八股的新式女子想不出，｜也做一兩件摩登衣服，專爲出客用，送給馬路上民衆們參觀，在家則破衣粗服，囚首垢，面，留給丈夫看，</p>
<p>諸位會員先生們，想想男女平等的問題，到底怎樣解决？還是不解决，就這樣算了？</p>
<p>眞的</p>

<p>— 逸農</p>
<p>記得去年的夏日，溽暑的天氣。我從百忙中抽出一點空工夫。到法租界一條小衖裏，在亭子間居住的，一個早年的老同學那裏去探視。我這個老同學Ａ君，是我的最敬最畏的益友。胞負了全身的本領，與充滿的毅力，在那汚穢的政治舞臺，厮混了好幾年。他的成績狠不錯！名利雙收，他同他的她｜二個女小孩。過甜蜜的生活。夫唱婦隨，宜室宜家，確是値得令人景仰的啊。</p>
<p>不景氣的潮流，蔓延到了不幸的Ａ君，｜欠薪｜减折｜裁撤，｜終結是失業了。他們一家的生活，漸漸的緊縮起來。等到緊無可緊，縮無可縮的時候，終</p>
<p>結是發生問題了。</p>
<p>緊縮的結果，單幢的小洋樓不住，去住那蒸籠似的亭子間。充分滋養的食料吃不到，適合的衣服穿不着，什麽頤養身心的娱樂，没有享受的分了。他們倆在這樣惡劣的環境中圖生存，確是一件難事。當我走進Ａ君的臥室，眼看見Ａ君在這大熱的天氣，還是躺在一只小木床上。慘白的顔色，短促的呼吸，好</p>
<p>像動彈不得似的表示他是病倒了。他的夫人Ｔ女士，是受過相當的敎育，有透澈的人生觀，從戀愛的過程中舉行了隆重的婚禮。三年來愛的結晶，已經有了二個女孩子了。現在呢，她正悉眉百結</p>
<p>的坐在一只半舊的布榻上，哄這兩個小孩子。Ａ君看見我走進了他的臥室，急忙照呼我坐在他的床邊，顫着的聲浪，向我說道：</p>
<p>（逸啊！結婚爲戀愛的墳墓！這一</p>
<p>句話，是一點不錯的。當我們倆結婚的前；何等甜蜜。我們倆結合的基礎是築在精神不是築在物質上的。誰知道，到了今天，精神還是這個精社，物質呢；却是大不同了。就是我們倆的情愛，快要起變化了病貧相加的我，不從物質上去奮鬥，恐怕不能夠維持這般的戀愛罷。古人說，夫婦間的戀愛，呌作魚水之歡。我說，戀愛是魚，金錢是水，魚離</p>
<p>了水是不能生存的。戀愛而没有金錢的助力，恐怕難以持久罷？</p>
<p>我聽了他的話，一面呌他不要多感觸，多思慮，安心靜養是最緊要啊。一面勸Ｔ女士，不要爲了這幾句，憤激的病人的話，發生了裂痕。須要互相諒解纔是道理。Ｔ女士雖然没有什麽說。但是據我曉得的說，的確爲了這般的環境，說了好多的怨言，什麽（没有了我，你就不致於受這般家累，這是我害你的呀，）Ａ君聽了這些話，當然不能全無</p>
<p>感觸的，</p>
<p>前日的晚上，我一個人，沿着那平滑的愚園路散步着。一所精雅的紅樓中，映出碧綠的燈光。鐵門啓處，一對夫婦狠潇灑地走出來。仔細一看，這就是的老同學Ａ君，伴着他的她Ｔ女士。他</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>們倆見了我，就照呼我到他的家裏；在一間小小的客室裏閒談着。我因此曉得Ａ君，在去年病後，謀得了一個適合的位置，并且恢復了舊日的生活。但是Ａ君始終維持他的成見，</p>
<p>戀愛是魚，金錢是水，水能養活魚，魚是離不了水！</p>

<p>花柳病在上海高速度的增加，某醫生以善於投機經營，居然團團作富家翁了，於是在法租界附近，租了兩所住家房子，一作爲醫院，一作爲藥房，都欵以自已的大名，更廣置Ｘ光燈，太陽燈···等等設備，還有許多人爲他宣傳，營業誠蒸蒸日上，一日千里，受了他的宣傳作用，我也初次登門求診，在客室的一角，設了掛號處，（</p>
<p>號金兩元，）那穿了黑長衫像包打聽一般的人物對我說，我付了兩塊錢，「初診，還是覆診？）他老人家大概受了主人的影響（請看以下本文）用命令的口吻問我，（初診，）我說，他就授給我一塊初診和一塊四十八號的銅牌，這時客室裏候着十幾位病人，依牌號診治，現在祗輪到三十二號，我無可奈何在附近蕩一回馬路，等而又等，兩小時後輪到四十八號了，我踏進診察室，是一間富於高等醫師設備的廂房，看護婦收去了銅牌，令我坐在某醫生旁邊的一隻白漆凳上，他開始問我；（什麽病？）（肺病，）（在鄕下看過，）（服過什麽藥？）問到這裏，他在一張印刷的紙上，塡寫些什麽，</p>
<p>（打過針，）（什麽藥水？）他繼續寫，眼都没有看我，（ＸＸＸＸ（一種肺病藥水））（唔，（似乎懷疑的樣子，）有寒熱嗎？）（没有，）（咳嗽嗎？）（早上有，）（有痰嗎？）（有，）（有血嗎？）（没有，）　　於是他吩咐一句什麽話，看護婦拿一隻熱度表放在我的嘴裏，他繼續寫，三分鐘後，看護婦報告（三十七度三），　　（有寒熱！）他好像自語，同時像責備我說了謊，</p>
<p>於是剛診察我的胸部，約略聽了一聽，用手指敲了一遍，（肺部呼吸力太弱，先退了寒熱再說，）</p>
<p>他又在印刷的紙上塡寫，（是肺病嗎？）我不禁懷疑而問了（是的，）</p>
<p>（第幾期？）</p>
<p>（唔···唔···大約（注意，醫生可以用（大約）口吻）第二期，）（壞在那裏？）</p>
<p>（肺尖，）（下部完好？）（大約（再注意）完好，）（退寒熱藥服了後怎樣？）（先照Ｘ光）</p>
<p>我想再問，看護婦喊四十九號的進來審問了，我被逼到隔壁的藥房裏，買了藥他們不給我藥方，</p>
<p>（藥方呢）（那是存在這裏的，預備覆診的對照，）</p>
<p>這上面的一件事，可以想到上海請醫生的可怕，病診都在問供中探出來，</p>
<p>并且還不能斷决這是什麽病，再没有藥方，病人誤服藥後，也不能交涉，於是我的初診終於是初診，大約（不必注意）他還候着我去拍Ｘ光照呢，</p>

<h3 id="e1">New Trends in the European Economy 仁 <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>With the end of the Great War, global consumption rebounded. The productive forces of major capitalist countries and emerging capitalist countries all experienced a temporary surge. However, as time passed, global purchasing power declined, trade routes became blocked, and overproduction occurred, leading to the current global economic crisis.</p>
<p>Since the Great War, the capitalization of backward countries, colonies, and semi-colonies has resulted in the rejection of imports from advanced countries, thereby shrinking their trade routes. Or, they implemented high tariffs to protect their own industries. This is one reason for the obstruction of trade routes after the surge in global productivity. Furthermore, Imperial Russia, spanning Europe and Asia, which was once a commodity sales market for capitalist countries, can no longer be exploited by capitalist countries after the establishment of the Soviet government. This is the second reason for the shrinking of trade routes after the surge in global production. In addition, after the Great War, the world experienced a period of currency inflation. During this period, currency values fell, and the middle class invisibly lost their savings. The real lives of laborers became impoverished. Subsequently, during the period of surging production, wages were reduced through industrial rationalization, and salaries of those receiving stipends were also reduced due to insufficient state finances. This led to widespread poverty among the masses, the third reason for the decline in purchasing power after the surge in global production.</p>
<p>As a result of this trade route obstruction, international trade sharply declined, and the inventory of unsold goods in warehouses greatly increased. In the last five years, the world's unsold goods have increased by approximately two to five times or more compared to before.</p>
<p>Recently, in Europe, due to the aforementioned reasons of sluggish international trade and recent currency fluctuations, the primitive form of commerce, barter, has been implemented. According to reports from Europe, an (International Goods Clearing Company) has been established in Bremen, Germany, to exchange hides, wool, tobacco, carpets, and dyes for cotton and wheat from Egypt and Denmark. In addition, in Paris, France, the (Nitouga International Commodity Trading Company), organized by banking institutions, has also been established and registered with the Swiss government. It exchanges industrial products for wheat, cotton, coffee, and textiles from the United States, Brazil, and Japan. Moreover, in addition to exchanging industrial products and agricultural products, this company also engages in the exchange of commodities for securities. Recently, it was reported that Nitouga Company has been negotiating with American importers to exchange French goods for American securities.</p>
<p>The crux of today's global economic crisis lies in the contradiction between productive forces and production relations. However, the occurrence of this phenomenon is by no means accidental, and its elimination cannot be achieved by "treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts." This is the common belief of insightful individuals. Therefore, the aforementioned dramatic economic trends in Europe are indeed unavoidable relief plans at present. However, whether the results can thoroughly save the declining trend of capitalist economics built upon the private property system is something we do not wish to make hasty judgments about. However, under this new trend, the future fate of capitalism can be roughly predicted.</p>
<p>Foreign Telegrams</p>
<p>The Central Government is Anxiously Seeking to Resolve the Situation; the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee Will Be Held Early; If There Are Practical Difficulties, a Meeting of the Majority of Central Committee Members Will Be Held First to Discuss Emergency Measures.</p>
<p>Wu Jingheng Goes to Wuhan to Solicit Chiang's Opinion; the President of the Executive Yuan Will First Be Appointed as an Interim.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Jingheng went to Wuhan because, after the resignation of Wang and Zhang, Chiang's opinion is crucial to the resolution of the current situation. At the same time, his opinion must also be sought regarding holding the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee early. According to unofficial news, if there are practical difficulties in holding the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee early, then in the near future, a meeting of the majority of Central Committee members will be convened first to discuss emergency measures. This meeting will not have a fixed name. Before the meeting is convened, it is planned to first appoint someone who can win the support of the public as the President of the Executive Yuan for the transitional period, and then officially elect him at the meeting. However, if Vice President Song can agree to temporarily maintain the difficult situation, then no one else will be appointed. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Wu Zhihui arrived in Hankou on the 13th by boat and immediately went to Yihua Village to meet with Chiang, discussing the matter of persuading Wang to stay. It was decided to visit Mount Luojia on the 14th. (13th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Peiping) Chiang and Zhang both telegraphed Han, soliciting his agreement for the position of Chairman of the Peiping Branch. Han declined the important responsibility, citing the importance of Shandong's military and political affairs, and telegraphed Chiang and Zhang, suggesting that Chiang temporarily assume the position himself. The Peiping Branch can be established as soon as Chiang replies by telegram. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Xueliang firmly resigns from all positions. According to reliable sources here, Chiang Kai-shek will organize a committee to resolve the issue of succession. Chiang does not want to select one person to succeed Zhang but wants to appoint several committee members to take over. As for who the committee members and the chairman will be, it is currently unknown. Zhang's personal plans are also unknown. However, it is reported that Fang Benren and Bao Wenye will go south tonight with Zhang's personal letter to meet with Chiang, requesting approval of his resignation and discussing the overall situation in North China.

<p>(Nanjing) A certain political figure who recently came to Nanjing from Peiping said that the attitude of the North China people toward Zhang's resignation can be divided into two factions: (1) Young students and laborers, etc., lost faith in Zhang long ago due to his loss of the three northeastern provinces last year and hope that the Central Government will approve his resignation as soon as possible. (2) The capitalist class and the general public do not care about Zhang's departure or stay, only hoping that the local order will not be affected. The diplomatic community in Peiping and Tianjin is paying close attention to our country's political situation. According to foreigners, whether our country's political situation can develop in the future and whether the eastern provinces can be recovered depends on the course of this political change.

<p>Tang Yulin May Resign; the Rehe Problem May Lead to a Major Incident; the Volunteer Army Captures Heishan County and Advances Towards Dahushan and Goubangzi. (Peiping) News this morning stated that Tang Yulin, Chairman of Rehe Province, may also resign. It is said that Tang is dissatisfied with the trend of the political situation and is therefore willing to resign. At a time when Japan is clamoring to invade Rehe, the rumor of Tang's resignation has attracted much attention from the political circles here. Foreign observers believe that Japan's actions in Rehe are inevitable sooner or later. The Japanese have long declared that they regard Rehe as a part of "Manchukuo." They now openly believe that if Chinese troops enter Rehe, Japan will regard it as a hostile act and will quickly implement its well-prepared plans. According to current opinion, the Japanese may take such actions on the pretext of military necessity and include the entire North China. However, it is expected that the Japanese army will not invade North China immediately, as the Japanese seem to believe that "Manchukuo" is a separate military issue that can be resolved within the three northeastern provinces without involving the situation and affairs within the customs. Generally, foreign observers believe that the Japanese have now decided that it is best to deal with the domestic problems of "Manchukuo" with all their strength and to deal with the Volunteer Army problem by the Japanese military authorities. The Volunteer Army is difficult to avoid the bombardment of Japanese aircraft until the sorghum is eliminated. Reports about the Volunteer Army are often exaggerated. However, foreigners here and in the eastern provinces generally believe that the so-called "bandit forces" of the Japanese are indeed more serious than at the beginning of the war last autumn, which cannot be denied. It remains to be seen whether the changes in the political situation in Peiping will affect the status of "Manchukuo." Some observers say that it will not have an impact, but it will not affect North China, as the Japanese have decided to adopt a passive policy on this matter unless the Chinese side takes actions that the Japanese regard as hostile in nature, such as sending troops to Rehe. The area around Peiping may be safe, but the Rehe problem has not been resolved. The Japanese are determined to include Rehe as a province of "Manchukuo" at an appropriate time, but China is equally determined not to lose this province. Therefore, no matter what changes occur in Peiping due to Zhang Xueliang's resignation, the Rehe problem is now a dark cloud that may lead to a major incident between China and Japan in the future. Therefore, the opinion of Tang Yulin, Chairman of Rehe Province, is extremely noteworthy. It is said that Tang is very pessimistic, which may be a prelude to his resignation. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Reuters reported that a part of the Volunteer Army captured Heishan County and is advancing towards Dahushan and Goubangzi. (13th dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e13">10,000 Mongolian Soldiers Advance Towards Jinzhou <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Peiping) Chinese sources still claim that the Northeast Volunteer Army has won victories. According to recent reports, 10,000 Mongolian soldiers are now advancing towards Jinzhou to assist the Chinese in attacking key Japanese positions. This statement was spread by railway personnel. It is said that key points near Jinzhou have been seized by the Volunteer Army. Another message said that the railway between Shanhaiguan and Jinzhou, which was destroyed by the Volunteer Army, has been repaired, but the track between Xinmin and Shenyang has been destroyed again. It is said that Japanese armored trains have driven out of Shanhaiguan, probably to assist the Japanese soldiers in Suizhong and Jinzhou. It is also said that a large number of Volunteer Army soldiers have gathered in the territory of Juliuhe and Xinglongdian (transliteration), and fierce battles have broken out. This statement remains to be verified. In the past, everyone thought that the Mongolians were inclined toward (Manchukuo), but now they know that this is not entirely true.

<p>(Peiping) The Volunteer Army attacking Jinzhou used a lottery method last night to form a suicide squad. They were bare-armed, wrapped in grass, and held powerful handguns. They rolled into the Japanese army's position, engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat, and once occupied Jinzhou Station, capturing one Japanese tank and a large number of machine gun bullets.

Machine guns and cannons have been installed in all mountain passes of Rehe Province, and fortifications have been built at all key points. Tang is doing his best to maintain security in Rehe. The rumor that the Japanese authorities are negotiating with Xiao, a senator from Rehe, is not true. (13th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Peiping) The Volunteer Army from all directions is still besieging Shenyang. Because Japanese aircraft are assisting in the defense, it is difficult to capture. Now the Volunteer Army has received a large number of supplies and is scheduled to issue a general offensive order again within a few days. Zhang Chunshan's troops, which occupied Heishan, withdrew due to insufficient supplies and are preparing to join forces with Liu Changji's troops to launch a counterattack. Both sides are still engaged in hand-to-hand combat in Jinzhou. Xingcheng and Suizhong are also in chaos. (13th dispatch)</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Regarding the measures to deal with the telecommunications administration of the Northeast, the authorities of the Ministry of Communications believe that the blockade policy is not very applicable. After careful research by the Telecommunications Administration Department in charge, three principles have been formulated, which have been signed and submitted to Minister Huang for review and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion. The principles are: 1. All radio stations in the country will stop communicating with radio stations in the area of the puppet forces in the Northeast. 2. Any radio station within China shall not relay communications between the puppet organization and international communications. 3. The puppet organization is an illegal organization, and all parties shall not directly communicate with it. In addition, when Zhang Zuolin was in the eastern provinces, he signed a contract with Britain and the United States for international radio communication. After the Shenyang Incident, the Japanese seized it as their own. The Central Government has repeatedly telegraphed Zhang Xueliang to negotiate with them. The Ministry of Communications has now consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to issue notes to the British and American embassies, declaring that the rebels in the Northeast cannot inherit foreign treaties, and that the above-mentioned contract should be abolished immediately before China recovers the lost territory in the Northeast.

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 13th - Prime Minister Saitō told a guest today that the Japanese government has not yet decided when to recognize "Manchukuo." It is not possible to grant recognition until "Manchukuo" has completed all internal organization. He also said that external rumors that the Japanese government will recognize "Manchukuo" before the League of Nations General Assembly convenes in September are unfounded. It should be known that Japan's actions are unrelated to the League of Nations.

<p>Unstable Ideology Among Rural Youth</p>
<p>Large-Scale Crackdown by North Hamgyong Province Police Department</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reports that with the worsening situation on the border between North Manchuria and Soviet Russia, Koreans who have received communist education in Red Russia are secretly returning to Korea and building strong bases in the Hamgyong Province region of northern Korea, guiding rural youth and propagating red ideology. It has now been learned by the Pukchong Police Station of North Hamgyong that during Governor-General Ugaki's inspection of North Hamgyong on May 12, an attempt to riot was planned. Anti-imperialist leaflets were repeatedly discovered in the North Hamgyong Provincial Kyongsong High School and Agricultural School. As a result of searches and arrests by the Ranam, Unggi, and Songjin police stations, 230 people have been arrested as of August 5. In addition, 350 rural youths have been apprehended in the southern part of North Hamgyong. The content of their red labor-peasant union is terrifying, attempting to undermine the virtuous farmer associations organized by their parents and brothers, and instilling red ideology. Therefore, parents and brothers in places such as Chongjin, Myongchon, and Ojindai secretly reported to the police authorities, and the children resented their parents and brothers, organizing parent-killing associations. Such outrageous behavior occurred in May with the discovery of a youth killing his mother. Therefore, in order to prevent the spread of this phenomenon, the Korean authorities have ordered police stations in various places to search for unstable elements. More than 500 suspicious people have been apprehended in recent days.</p>

<p>Coalition Negotiations at an Impasse</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 13th - Hitler met today with Chancellor von Papen, General Schleicher, and the Minister of Defense, demanding the position of Federal Chancellor. However, the President and the government could only offer him the position of Vice-Chancellor and Premier of Prussia at most. Hitler was still dissatisfied, saying that the recent general elections had proven that the German people wanted him to be Chancellor, so he could not accept any other position. Hitler also demanded that the two positions of Minister of Interior and Minister of Defense be given to the Nazi Party. Papen agreed to consider this further. Later, because Hitler continued to demand the position of Chancellor, the two sides could no longer speak, and the talks broke down. After the breakdown, Hitler immediately went to see President Hindenburg. The President, like Papen, refused to give him the position of Chancellor. As expected, the matter has reached an impasse, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 12th - After insisting yesterday that he must first see President Hindenburg before engaging in direct negotiations with President von Papen, Nazi leader Hitler suddenly changed his mind this morning and notified von Papen to prepare for a meeting with him first. He went to von Papen's official residence on Wilhelm Street in the morning, and the talks continued until after noon. The content is unknown. Before Hitler arrived at the Chancellor's residence, a large group of Nazi Party members stood to welcome him, saluting the party. It is now expected that Hitler will meet with the President this afternoon, with Chancellor von Papen also present to handle matters. A concrete agreement on the reorganization of the cabinet can be expected. At present, everyone in Berlin is waiting for the outcome of the talks between the two sides. All conversations are based on this information, and it is said that Hitler visited Minister of Defense Schleicher before meeting with the Chancellor, which shows that this conversation is extremely important.</p>

<h3 id="e76">British Imperial Conference Expresses Opinion on Stable Finance <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Hoping for International Cooperation</p>
<p>Implementing Measures to Increase Wholesale Prices</p>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 12th - The British Imperial Economic Conference released a document on monetary and financial issues, stating that what is most needed now is a general rise in wholesale prices around the world. Whether the harm of falling prices is due to political, economic, financial, sensual, or monetary reasons, governments and individuals must have a way to eliminate it. All participating governments are aware of the necessity of international cooperation to cope with this difficult problem and are willing to work with other countries to implement practical plans to increase wholesale prices. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain said that there are various reasons for low prices, not only due to currency, so if you want to raise prices, you must correct various reasons. However, the British government believes that releasing sufficient short-term bonds at low interest rates may have a valuable impact. The Economic Conference agreed with this and advised other participating countries to do the same. The document also mentioned the relationship between exchange rate stability and trade, saying that this matter must be fully resolved only after the recovery of a situation in which international standards can be carried out satisfactorily. The conference has considered the possibility of obtaining good results in two ways, one is to mutually adjust the exchange rate of their currencies against the British pound, and the other is to stop investment manipulation in the British pound. The conference did not make any proposals on restoring a satisfactory international monetary standard, because this issue will soon be discussed by an international conference. However, the conference believed that before re-establishing an international monetary standard, there is an extremely important condition, that is, the prices of goods in various countries must rise to be consistent with costs.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th - The events of the past few days have provided economic recovery theorists with a lot of material for commentary. What is noteworthy in the Ottawa monetary report is the defects of the conference, not its achievements. Several great plans, such as the establishment of an imperial banking system with an imperial currency system, have now been shelved indefinitely. All those who strongly advocate a multiple currency system are particularly disappointed by this. However, the conference has prepared a path for the World Economic Conference and established the fundamental principles that the British Empire can consistently pursue. This is welcomed by the British. President Hoover's speech as a presidential candidate did not have a very pleasant reaction in Britain. Supporters of President Hoover believe that Hoover's words were directed internally, so they did not pay much attention to them. This morning, London newspapers said that Hoover focused too much on the debt reduction value of military disarmament and forgot the necessity of foreign currency circulation. Hoover wants to expand the market for American goods, but this move is not compatible with the active protection of American industry. However, Hoover's words have opened the door to modifying war debts. From now on, the United States may not be isolated from world affairs. The US government's policy of reducing weekly working hours to accommodate unemployed workers is highly praised. According to news from Geneva, the International Labor Office, initiated by Italy, has convened a main committee to hold a special meeting on September 21 to develop procedures for reducing working hours, and then submit these procedures to the World Economic Conference.</p>

<p>Attempting to Maintain Voters' Allegiance</p>
<p>Advocacy of Alcohol Prohibition Loses Some Sympathy</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 12th - US President Hoover stated today that he intends to convene a national conference to coordinate the restoration of industry and commerce through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. A committee will be organized by business leaders in each Federal Reserve District to determine what is urgent, what is secondary, and the allocation of funds. Commentators believe that President Hoover's move is the beginning of his large-scale movement to promote economic revival. The presidential election is in the winter, and from the Republican Party's point of view, the economy needs to show signs of revival in order to maintain voters' allegiance. The fact that securities prices and commodity prices both rose on the New York Stock Exchange last week is a good sign to encourage people and promote economic recovery. However, the Democratic Party says that this is the government and its wealthy friends deliberately manipulating the market before the election to raise securities and commodity prices. However, President Hoover has stated that he will proceed cautiously step by step in promoting the recovery of the economy, and the use of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is an important part of Mr. Hoover's plan. Reuters, Washington, 12th - President Hoover's remarks when accepting the Republican nomination for presidential candidate, advocating that each state should handle alcohol prohibition on its own, but with the restriction that hotels should not be reopened, have now resonated. Prohibitionist leader Phipps agrees with Hoover's proposal, saying that the president's proposal is not supported by extremists on both sides, but the majority of moderate-minded Americans will accept it. Extreme prohibitionists say that President Hoover's policy may abolish national alcohol prohibition, but compared to the proposals of Democratic presidential candidate Roosevelt, they feel it is more reconcilable, so prohibitionists propose to work hard to ensure that more and more members who advocate prohibition are re-elected to Congress. Newspaper criticism varies depending on the party's colors.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Seattle, 12th - The Christian Women's Temperance Union is holding its annual meeting here. Today, it resolved not to be involved in President Hoover's election campaign because he gave a speech when accepting the Republican presidential nomination advocating amending the prohibition law. It is said that today's resolution by the association will reduce the Republican Party's votes in the presidential election by more than one million.</p>

There have been many changes in the ambassadors and consuls in South America and the Scandinavian countries. However, the several posts in the Far East, which were previously rumored to have changes, have not been implemented. Among the newly appointed ambassadors, the more important ones are: Rosso appointed to the United States, Count Morano appointed to France, and Sheruti stationed in Germany. National News Agency, Rome, 12th - The Italian government issued a statement promoting the current ambassador to Greece, Bassidianni, to the ambassador to Poland, and transferring the ambassador to Hungary, Alotai, to be promoted to the ambassador to Brazil. Rosso, Guariglia, and Loga Consi, the three directors of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were sent abroad as ambassadors to the United States, Spain, and Turkey, respectively. Rogo was also appointed as the ambassador to Czechoslovakia. In addition, new people were also appointed as ambassadors to Germany, Belgium, France, and Denmark, Sweden, and Luxembourg.</p>

<p>and appointed new diplomats to succeed them. The Italian Prime Minister's replacement of a large number of ambassadors is to train new people so that in the future, there will be more experienced diplomats and politicians when something happens. According to official sources, Botai was willing to take the position of ambassador to France, but he was afraid of being assassinated by anti-papist activists in Paris, so it did not work out, so Morano was changed to be the ambassador to France.</p>

<p>Reuters, Madrid, 12th - The normal state of affairs is gradually returning to Spain, and the riots can gradually be forgotten. However, the fate of the arrested military officers and soldiers who participated in the restoration is still uncertain. General Sanjurjo, after being interrogated at the police station for several hours today, was escorted to a military prison. Sanjurjo's face was pale. General opinion is that Sanjurjo was misled by the nobles and had no intention of undermining the Republic. The authorities may be lenient and spare his life. In the past two days, the people of Seville were terrified, but it was very quiet last night. Streetcars, trams, etc., have all resumed operations today, and the public offices are still guarded by soldiers and police.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 12th - Today, a major disturbance occurred in the city of Granada, Spain.

<p>Indicator to Threaten Submarines</p>
<p>Extremely Functional, Experiment Successful</p>
<p>(London Dispatch) Recently, the British Admiralty has invented a noteworthy new weapon, namely an indicator to threaten submarines. This indicator has the ability to discover any deeply hidden submarine. According to a recent experiment, six submarines were first dispatched. Twenty-four hours later, several of these indicators were sent out to search. As a result, all the submarines were discovered one by one within just six hours. (If this were during actual wartime, after discovery, destroyers could encircle and attack.) This is because the indicator has the function of indicating the precise position, direction, and distance of the submarine. The British Admiralty is keeping this invention strictly secret, preventing any leaks. The soldiers in charge of the indicator system are also undergoing special training. What outsiders can know is only that this device is similar to a tank. (World Press)</p>

Although many members of the team are ill along the way, the most courageous Mr. Merkel, Mr. Wesner, and Mr. Butschudot have already climbed a peak of 22,750 feet and set up Camp No. 7. The location is below the Nangaparbat peak, overlooking crags and glacial erratics 16,000 feet high, as if in a deep abyss. The peak is 27,000 feet high and can be climbed straight up from the ridge. However, most of the expedition's transport personnel cannot endure this high altitude cold and danger. Therefore, these three strong vanguards are temporarily isolated from the main team, their supplies cut off, facing extreme hardship. But their leader still deeply believes that they will be able to complete the mapping of the Nangaparbat peak.</p>

<p>(Beiping Correspondence) Recently, after the general mobilization of the Northeast National Salvation Army, all railways in the Northeast have fallen into a state of great chaos and complete stagnation. The Beining Railway west of Jinzhou and east of Dahushan has been cut into several sections by the National Salvation Army. A troop train was overturned at Qingweizi Station, causing heavy losses for the Japanese side. The Datong branch line, north of Zhangwu, is entirely under the control of the National Salvation Army. The Sitao Railway is under siege and attack by the National Salvation Army of the 5th Military District near Zhengjiatun. The Tongliao Railway has been occupied by the same army and is therefore completely interrupted. The Nanman Railway in Haicheng, Liaoyang, and Dashiqiao has been occupied by the National Salvation Army of the 3rd Military District, causing significant damage. The interruption has already lasted for more than ten days. Recently, the Anfeng Railway has been under attack by Deng Tiemei's troops of the 3rd Military District. Station staff do not dare to serve between Fengcheng, Sitaizi Station, and Jiguan Mountain Station. The deputy station chief, Zhang Baogui, was kidnapped, and the line is completely interrupted. The eastern side of the Shenhai Railway has been occupied by the troops of Zhang Min, the garrison commander of seven counties. Roadbeds have been cut and bridges destroyed at Qingyuan, Nanzhamu, and other stations, and power lines have been destroyed, completely cutting off transportation. Therefore, the departure of important Japanese officials has to rely on airplanes, but troop transportation is extremely difficult. The Japanese army's so-called strategy of using circular railways to overcome the many with the few is completely inapplicable.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Eastern Hubei Suppression Army Launches General Attack on Huang'an Bandit Den <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Wei Lihuang's Troops Capture Hekou Town</p>
<p>Peng Zhenshan Telegraphs Macheng Relief, Hankou Correspondence. Since the remnants of He and Duan's bandits fled into Honghu Lake, the Hubei province's bandit suppression plan has had initial success. The military focus has also shifted from central Hubei to eastern Hubei. Huang'an and Macheng counties are becoming the sites of fierce competition between the army and bandits. Initially, Huang'an County in eastern Hubei, bordering Henan province, had dense mountains and forests, allowing bandits to thrive. The areas of Qiliping, Taohuadian, Hekou, and Qiting in the county were all bandit strongholds. On December 22nd of last year, the county seat fell, and the entire county became a bandit area. The fake "Henan-Hubei-Anhui-Jiangsu Soviet" was established there. In July of this year, Liao Rongkun, the commander of the 25th Division of the fake Fourth Front Army, once captured Luotian, while Zhang Guotao, the commander of the fake Independent Division, and the fake Guerrilla Independent Regiment simultaneously besieged Macheng County. Qishui, Qichun, Huanggang, Huangpi, and Guangji were also repeatedly harassed by bandits. At that time, He and Duan's bandits suffered setbacks at Tianqian, and Kuang's bandits collapsed at Huoqiu. There was a gradual trend of disintegration within the Red bandits. Generalissimo Chiang then dispatched a large army to begin suppression. After the general offensive, successive victories were achieved. On the 9th of this month, Wei Lihuang's troops of the Sixth Column attacked Hekou Town southwest of Huang'an. The bandits resisted fiercely, resulting in a day of fierce fighting. The bandits suffered 4,000 casualties and were also suppressed by the aircraft of the Fourth Air Team, so they fled towards Huang'an. At that time, the bandits of Huangpi and Xiaogan, hearing the news, came to reinforce, but they were also scattered. Wei's army then completely recovered Hekou at dawn on the 10th, and pursued the victory, joining other columns in attacking Huang'an. After receiving the report, Generalissimo Chiang telegraphed all parties to announce the victory. The telegram said, "(According to the report from the commander of the 14th Army, Wei, on the 10th, and the Fourth Air Team at 4 PM on the 10th, Hekou Town was indeed occupied by our Sixth Column, with countless bandits killed and captured. The main force of the bandits fled in a disheveled manner along the northeast avenue, passing through the river through Leijiatian towards Qiliping, and a part fled through Qingliangtinggang towards Huang'an. Our army is pursuing them separately," and so on. Furthermore, on the 12th, the aircraft reported that the remnants of the Huangguan bandits were in an extremely disheveled state, and it would not be difficult to annihilate them in the shortest period of time. However, it is heard that a large part of the fake Fourth Front Army is stationed there, and many Red bandits from various places are also fleeing there, fearing that there will still be fierce fighting when the officers and soldiers advance to suppress them. On the Macheng side, the Red bandits besieged it three times. Generalissimo Chiang first dispatched the 54th Division of Hao Mengling to suppress them, and then dispatched the 30th Division of Peng Zhenshan to provide assistance. The Red bandits, hearing the news, first retreated to Huang'an, and Macheng remained safe and sound. Peng telegraphed the Pacification Commissioner's Office on the 11th, reporting the siege process. The telegram briefly stated, "(This time, to aid Macheng, the original order was to dispatch powerful troops. I immediately dispatched the 8th and 9th Brigades to relieve the siege of Macheng. Subsequently, I received urgent telegrams from the Commander-in-Chief frequently urging me to lead all the troops to provide support. Under the order, I disregarded everything and led the troops to Zhongguanyi. Upon reaching the station, I happened to encounter a large part of the bandits gathering in the Dadouposhan area, besieging Macheng urgently. I immediately ordered them to join forces with the 31st Division to suppress them forcefully, fighting to the death. The officers and soldiers of each unit obeyed the order with great enthusiasm, determined to sweep away the bandits in one fell swoop and never return alive. On the 10th, Army Commander Zhang Yinxiang returned to Song from Hankou and ordered me to withdraw the order and not attack for the time being. I obeyed and withdrew the previous order. Recently, according to reports from the local militia, the bandits, hearing that our large army had arrived and seeing our determination to fight to the death, all secretly fled towards Huang'an on the night of the 10th, so the siege of Macheng was lifted and transportation was restored," and so on. It is certain that the suppression of bandits in eastern Hubei has made significant progress. The remnants of the bandits in Honghu Lake in central Hubei are now blockaded and in a state of great disarray. Army Commander Xu has ordered Wan Yaohuang, Zhang Zhenhan, and Xiao Zhichu's units to surround and suppress them separately. Generalissimo Chiang has also dispatched aircraft and the Yong Sheng warship to assist, using the power of the army, navy, and air force to directly attack the bandit lair, aiming to clear them within this month. The Second Fleet of the Navy has also dispatched the Minsheng, Weisheng, and Desheng ships to patrol the area of Xindi, Yuezhou, and Jianli, preventing the bandits from crossing secretly. He's bandits originally intended to flee to Hunan, but now they will not be able to fly across. As for Kong's bandits in southern Hubei, they occupy Longgang and Yanxia in Yangxin, and their power is quite rampant. On the 12th, Chiang dispatched five aircraft from the Sixth Air Team to bomb them. According to reports, several bandit nests have been destroyed. He Chengjun will depart for Puqi within days to direct the suppression. (August 12th)</p>

<p>Also Encouraging the Governments of Three Provinces to Refine and Diligently Train Local Militia, Hankou Correspondence. During Generalissimo Chiang's current visit to Hankou to suppress bandits, amidst the urgent military matters, he has been earnestly encouraging all parties to cultivate talent and transform customs. On the 10th, he also issued handwritten instructions to the Secretariat of the Headquarters, stating that in these difficult and critical times, the situation is now at a point of life or death. Our people, who have been deeply influenced by civilization for thousands of years, have always valued the nation and clan above their own lives and families, considering it shameful to live in disgrace and disgraceful to avoid responsibility. Surely there are loyal and righteous talents with patriotic spirit who will rise up and be willing to join this Generalissimo in a common revolution to suppress the Red bandits, to secure the countryside within and resist strong enemies without. This Generalissimo will certainly treat them generously and with courtesy, regard them as comrades, and appoint them exceptionally. Tracing back to when Chiang arrived in Hankou, as soon as he dismounted from the military vehicle, he ordered Director He Chengjun to telegraph Zhang Nanxian, a gentry from Hubei, to come to Hankou and entrust him with the important task of being a Standing Committee member of the Party and Government Committee and presiding over the Supervisory Office. Others with a reputation for timeliness have also been recruited to seek talent for common governance, which has long been his determination. Furthermore, Chiang considered that the local militia in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui urgently needed to be trained. Therefore, on the 11th, he telegraphed Liu Zhi, the chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, Xia Douyin, the chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, and Wu Zhongxin, the chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, encouraging them to refine and diligently transform the local militia. The original telegram is as follows, "(The greatest objectives of organizing the local militia are two: first, to strengthen the power of the people, enabling them to assist the army in eliminating the bandit atmosphere; second, to popularize military training in preparation for the conscription system. Therefore, its responsibility contains two aspects: internal security and external resistance, not just protecting one's village. But in the past, the local militia has either become corrupt or been monopolized by others. I hope that you will work hard to train them, and not just focus on appearances. You must apply the spirit of the conscription system. In the past, each province has held up the excuse of insufficient financial resources to avoid making improvements. You must know that even a mediocre person can easily accomplish small things with a lot of money. It is enough to show the ability of a strong person to achieve great success in difficult circumstances. During the Qing Dynasty, Zeng and Hu used scholars to organize the local militia, forming a large army and eliminating Hong Yang. At that time, financial expenditures were a hundred times greater than now. In the 15th year of the Republic, we were confined to Guangdong, and the soldiers were poor and the people were poor, which was many times worse than today. We eventually created a strong army and completed the Northern Expedition. It can be seen that accomplishing great things does not rely on money, but on enthusiasm and perseverance. If those above refine and diligently work hard, those below will certainly be loyal and courageous in fighting. If you use financial resources to hinder our progress, you are not worthy to be among revolutionary comrades. Zhongzheng believes that the reform of the local militia is the only key to saving the country. I hope that you will lead them with all your might, transforming and training them, retiring them in stages to lead the way for the conscription system. I also hope that you will report the actual situation of the existing teams and the concrete plans for research, organization, and transformation to the Headquarters for future reference, and that their effectiveness will be used for evaluation." Chiang himself is still in Hankou, and will probably go to Lushan within days. The rumor that he left Hankou on the 10th is completely untrue. (August 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e86">Third Day of the Noulens Case Trial <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Handwriting Expert States Opinion Four Times</p>
<p>The Noulens Deliberately Make Trouble, the Judge's Anger Is Visible</p>
<p>On the 12th, the third day of the Noulens case trial opened. Thirty to forty people were in attendance, and lawyer Chen Ying and Noulens' relatives, Feng Jiesi, were also present. At 8:55 AM, Judge Li Mian, Judge Lin Zhemian, Judge Yin Yuexu, Prosecutor Zhu Jun, Translator Chen Shidi, Clerk Wu Daquan, and others arrived. The bailiff brought up the documents, and then immediately signed to bring up the Noulens, Wang Deli, and Zeng Zhi. At 9:20 AM, Mr. Mason, a handwriting expert employed by the Shanghai Municipal Council, was also summoned to the court to state his opinion on handwriting analysis, proving that the handwriting on various documents was written by the Noulens and Wang Deli Zeng. The judge summoned Wang Deli Zeng and asked for his opinion on the expert report. Wang created trouble unreasonably, demanding that the court read out the original text of a letter that was not related to the handwriting analysis. The original text of the letter was in French. After the court read it out, Wang demanded that the Chinese translation be read, and then demanded that the English translation be read. All of this was unrelated to the handwriting analysis. The Noulens refused to answer any questions about the handwriting analysis, clearly showing their intention to cause trouble. The court hearing ended at 1 PM on the same day, and it was decided to continue the hearing on the 15th and summon witnesses Ross Moore, Pan A'da, Ding Zheng Sheng, and others. It is expected that this hearing will be one of the most important. The following is a record of the court hearing on the 12th. (Judge) First, Noulens was asked, "You deposited 1,500 US dollars in the Mei Feng Bank. The letter you wrote to the Mei Feng Bank was written by you personally. This letter was handed over by the representative of the Mei Feng Bank. There is also a letter that you wrote to the police station after you were arrested. This was also written by you yourself. Now I will show it to you." (The judge then handed Noulens the letter to the Mei Feng Bank for review.) (Noulens) "I request the letter to the police station to be shown." (Judge) "Your handwriting has been authenticated by the police station as being written by you. There is also Exhibit 18, which was typed. You made some changes on it. These words are the same as the letter you wrote to the Mei Feng Bank." (The judge immediately handed over Exhibit 18 to Noulens for detailed review.) (Noulens) "In this document, there is no evidence of communist activities or other crimes." (Judge) "I am only asking if you made these changes." (Noulens) "Please note that pages 136 and 137 of this document were not typed on the same typewriter." (Judge) "That doesn't matter. You just say whether this handwriting is yours." (Noulens) "I will not answer." (Judge) "Why don't you answer? Yesterday, when I asked you about the evidence in the iron box, you did not answer, saying that it was because the evidence of the crime was in the iron box. Now I am only asking you if you changed the handwriting." (Noulens) "I request that the results of the authentication be shown." At this point, the judge summoned the handwriting expert, Mr. Mason, to the court. The time was 9:30 AM. The judge first asked the expert for his name, origin, age, and profession. According to his testimony, his name was Mason, he was British, 24 years old, and worked in the fingerprint department of the Shanghai police station. He had specialized in the study of handwriting. The judge then informed him that he should truthfully state his authentication opinion and ordered him to sign a pledge, which he did one by one. At this time, the Noulens suddenly stood up and objected to Mr. Mason's testimony, saying that the police station's staff could not testify. The judge stopped them and then asked Mr. Mason, (Judge) "After the Noulens and Wang Deli Zeng were arrested in the Shanghai concession, did you authenticate their handwriting?" (Mason) "Yes." (Judge) "You said that the letter the Noulens wrote to the Mei Feng Bank was written by the Noulens personally. What is your opinion?" (Mason) "Here is an enlarged photograph of the letter the Noulens wrote to the Mei Feng Bank." (While speaking, he took out the photograph. The Noulens shouted loudly in opposition. The judge ordered them to maintain order. The Noulens were helpless and demanded that the expert state his opinion loudly so that they could hear it.) Mason continued, "There is also a photograph, which is an enlarged photograph of Exhibit 18 on page 139 of the first volume of the evidence book." (Judge) "How can you see that the handwriting is the same in these two enlarged photographs?" (Mason) "After careful examination, I found several points in common: (1) In the handwriting in both documents, every letter is written to the upper right. (2) In the handwriting in both documents, the letters are of inconsistent sizes. (3) The arrangement of the letters is also uneven and not in a straight line. (4) As far as the structure of the words is concerned, the lowercase "s" at the end of the word in both documents does not curve, but is slightly inclined straight down. (5) The lowercase "i" has two ways of writing: one is that it is not connected to the preceding letter or the following letter, and the other is that it is connected to the preceding letter but not connected to the following letter. (6) When the lowercase "ng" are connected together, the "N" is written straight, and the lower part of the "g" is biased to the left. (7) The uppercase "F" is written the same way in both documents. (8) The uppercase "M" is the same in the word "Manage" in the letter to the Mei Feng Bank and the "M" written in Exhibit 18. One curve on the left is at a higher angle than one curve on the right. (9) The "O" in both documents is connected to the preceding letter, and the top is open. The "O" in the words "Contents" in the Mei Feng Bank letter and "Conspiracy" in Exhibit 18 are both like this. (10) The lowercase "F" is first curved up, then straight down, and no longer curves back up. Based on these points in common, it is determined that the handwriting in these two documents was written by the same person." At this point, the judge summoned Noulens and asked, "What do you have to say about this?" (Noulens) "According to Article 24, paragraph 7, and Article 119 of the Criminal Procedure Law, I have the right to request the cancellation of this expert because he is a staff member of the police station." (Judge) "Don't misunderstand the articles. Article 24 of the Criminal Procedure Law states the reasons why a judge should recuse himself. Article 119 states that an expert can be rejected if he has the same reasons as a judge. Mr. Mason does not have this kind of reason now, so you cannot reject him." (Noulens) "According to Article 24 of the Criminal Procedure Law, he is a staff member of the police station and of course cannot be an expert." (Judge) "Incorrect. Article 24, paragraph 7, refers to a person who is a judge, an expert, and a prosecutor at the same time. Mr. Mason is not like this now, and this refers to the institution, not to a specific person." (Noulens) "On August 3rd of last year, at the Shanghai High Court No. 2 Branch, the presiding judge said that if we objected to the police station's expert, we could find another expert." (Judge) "You first said that Mr. Mason cannot be an expert. Now I have explained it to you, and you are changing the subject." (Noulens) "I have a few things I want to say now: (1) I am not surprised that a court without jurisdiction allows a person without qualifications to be an expert. (2) The search procedure was illegal because no list was made, so I can object to any staff member of the police station being an expert. (3) I request that the court find an expert who belongs to the court and also authenticates Exhibits 19, 23, 53, 56, 57, etc., which the government announced last year as having my handwriting. The handwriting in these documents is very difficult to authenticate. (4) In addition to the documents published in the Continental Daily on September 16th of last year, it was also said that Exhibits 38, 47, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, etc., also have my handwriting. I request that they also be authenticated together. (5) I request that this police station's expert be cancelled." (Judge) "All of these words are incorrect. First, regarding the issue of jurisdiction, the Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected your application, and this court of course has jurisdiction. Second, you said that police station staff cannot be experts because the police station's search was illegal, but according to the Shanghai court's agreement, the police station has the right to search, and the Shanghai court also has search warrants. Moreover, this expert is authenticating based on his knowledge and has nothing to do with the institution. Third, experts are specialized talents. In countries around the world, these experts are attached to institutions, otherwise it would not be easy to find them. For example, fingerprinters are attached to the police department. If the court asks him to authenticate, how can you say that he is illegal? Fourth, if you attack the expert's authentication as being incorrect, that is acceptable, but you cannot say that he is the wrong person. Fifth, your request to hire another expert is contradictory. On the one hand, you say that this court has no jurisdiction, and on the other hand, you ask this court to hire another expert. Aren't you contradicting yourself? Sixth, now this court is first authenticating this document. As for whether or not to authenticate the documents published in the Continental Daily, that is another matter, and this court has the right to decide." (Noulens) "I still have to state that: (1) The opinions that I have expressed that are favorable to me have not been recognized by the court. (2) After this case occurred, the Supreme Court of China and this court have stated that they would handle it with caution, but there are many facts in the indictment that have no evidence, and they have actually been given the crime of death. (3) The court and the prosecutor have never given us a chance to prove our innocence. (4) The issue of jurisdiction is not based on the law. We are being tried here under duress, and the court is not allowing us to make an appropriate defense. (5) We are not now authorizing the lawyers to defend us in this court. We requested the court yesterday not to allow the lawyers to defend us in this court, but to still allow them to record in this court. We are not afraid of being tried in any Chinese court, but the court must be based on Chinese law." (At this point, the judge said that if they were not authorizing the lawyers, they could withdraw them. Noulens said that it was not that they were dissatisfied with lawyer Chen, but that they did not want to defend in this court. The judge then showed them the letter of authorization and ordered them not to waffle, but to focus on the authentication.) (6) The government authorities have published the documents in this case, but the defense lawyers are not allowed to photograph the documents when they request to do so. (7) In Europe, defendants have the right to find independent experts. (8) According to Chinese law, I have the right to object to the expert. (9) As far as I know, this expert has never appeared in court before. (10) The person who cracked this case is still police chief Givens of the police station, who is Mason's superior. If Mason is the expert, he will not be fair. (10) (1) To authenticate handwriting, you can find people from banks or stores. They have more research in comparison. We have been detained for 14 months, and the court has the responsibility to find them. (Judge) "Your reasons for rejecting this expert are not valid. I have already said that I will not answer your attack on his identity. You should express your opinion on his authentication opinion." (Noulens) "According to Article 299 of the Criminal Procedure Law, I request that the court make a ruling on rejecting my objection to the expert." (Judge) "I have already made a verbal ruling. Now you answer his authentication opinion. If you do not answer, you will be at a disadvantage." (At this point, the judge ordered Mr. Mason to repeat his authentication opinion to Noulens. Noulens refused to answer.) (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Talk by Yu Tan, Director of the Railway Department <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Implementing Responsible Transportation on All National Railways; Nanjing Correspondence: Recently, the Ministry of Railways is reorganizing the national railway administration. The first new measure they are undertaking is to implement responsible transportation on all railways. To understand the nature of this measure, we specially visited Yu Tan, Director of the Railway Department, who informed us of the details of the matter. The conversation is as follows: (Reporter asks) What is responsible transportation? (Answer) For example, when transporting goods by railway, from the time the owner delivers the goods to the station and requests transportation, to the time the railway transports the goods to the destination station and delivers them to the consignee, if the goods are lost during railway transportation or storage, the railway is responsible for compensation at the assessed value, except for force majeure events such as natural disasters or human calamities. Moreover, the goods can be transported to the destination station within the scheduled time without delay. This is what is called responsible transportation of goods. All European and American countries have adopted this system. In our country, only the Jiaoji and Beining lines have trialed it. (Question) What is the current method of goods transportation? (Answer) At present, Chinese railways generally use a method of irresponsible transportation. Merchants entrust goods for transportation, but they are often not transported for months, resulting in spoilage or theft. Even if they are transported, theft during the journey and collisions during loading and unloading cause significant losses to merchants. Merchants, whose capital is at stake, often view railway transportation as a dangerous path and turn to water transportation. As a result, forwarding companies have emerged. Forwarding companies operate by transporting goods on behalf of customers and earning a small commission. If managed properly, they can coexist with the railways without conflict. However, the current forwarding companies take advantage of the railways' irresponsible transportation, monopolize the market, and engage in deception and fraud against customers. For example, if a merchant has goods and wants to transport them by railway, directly entrusting them to the railway may result in indefinite delays and potential losses. They believe that having a forwarding company send an escort can prevent losses. However, forwarding companies intentionally create scarcity and demand exorbitant fees, with transportation costs often several times higher than the railway's original rates. Merchants who want to avoid unexpected losses and ensure speedy delivery have no choice but to spend heavily to satisfy their demands. As for goods of lower value, merchants cannot bear the losses of railway transportation and the exorbitant demands of forwarding companies, and would rather have them pile up in the production area than transport them out, leading to the current national economic distress. Railway freight has declined, the business community is in panic, and the national economy and people's livelihood are directly and negatively affected, while forwarding companies alone enjoy huge profits. This current method of railway transportation urgently needs improvement. (Question) Is there a solid guarantee that responsible transportation will be effective for the railways? (Answer) Implementing responsible transportation can reverse the current chronic problems of railway freight, as mentioned above. As for its effectiveness, let the performance of the Beining Railway serve as proof. In 1928, to attract freight, the Beining Railway cooperated with the Sitao and other railways for intermodal transportation. However, because Beining was not responsible for freight at the time, 99% of the goods transported from the Sitao and other railways were still absorbed by the South Manchuria Railway. By the end of 1930, Beining announced the implementation of responsible freight transportation. On that very day, more than 600 carloads of goods that had already been entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway were temporarily switched to the Beining Railway. And the Beining Railway, excluding the period after the September 18th Incident last year, increased its revenue by 3.3 million yuan in just nine months from the eleven stations with responsible transportation. The initial implementation has been so effective. If all the national railways follow suit, the results can be imagined in due course. (Question) How will the implementation of responsible transportation affect existing forwarding companies? (Answer) The original meaning of forwarding companies is to complement the railways. If forwarding companies can attract freight for the railways, the railways will have no reason to discriminate against them. However, forwarding companies arbitrarily exploit customers, causing freight to be impeded, and the railways are indirectly harmed by this. Therefore, the railways have to devise self-help strategies. Implementing responsible transportation is one such strategy. If forwarding companies can adopt a low-profit approach in the future, transporting goods on behalf of customers and earning only a small commission without making excessive demands, then railway freight will inevitably become prosperous. In the minds of cargo owners, as long as forwarding companies handle the transportation, various procedures can be avoided, and small expenses are acceptable. Forwarding companies should take advantage of this psychology and reduce commissions, so that their business will flourish even more. There is no need to be unduly concerned about the railway implementing responsible freight transportation. Finally, Director Yu also said that the beneficiaries of the railway's implementation of responsible transportation are not only the railways, freight merchants, and forwarding companies, but also the people's livelihood and economy. The flow of goods and corresponding supply will prevent the national livelihood from being as impoverished as it is today. Moreover, merchants who entrust goods for transportation and obtain a bill of lading issued by the railway can use this bill of lading as collateral to obtain loans from banks because the railway is responsible for it, allowing capital to circulate and stimulating the business community. Therefore, the implementation of responsible transportation is entirely beneficial and without any drawbacks. I hope to use the power of the newspapers to promote this innovative measure of the railway authorities and gain the sympathy of the public.</p>

<p>Director Dong of the Construction Department Inspects Dangers in Taicang. The sea dikes at Liuhe Estuary, Daotang Temple, Parade Ground, Yanglinkou, and other places in the county were impacted by strong winds and storm surges the day before, and the dikes were on the verge of collapse, posing an extremely dangerous situation. Qiu Xijue, Director of the Construction Bureau of Taicang County and concurrently Director of the Dike Works, immediately telegraphed the provincial department to report the dangerous situation. Dong Xiujia, Director of the Construction Department, arrived in Taicang at 8:00 AM yesterday and, together with Zhao Enju, the county magistrate, and Qiu Xijue, Director of the Dike Works, went to the dangerous areas to conduct an on-site inspection. Director Dong believed that the section of the dike was extremely dangerous. If it was not repaired quickly, the entire Taicang County would become a swamp once it collapsed, which was a matter of great importance to the safety of the area. He immediately approved the engineering estimate and ordered active repairs. The inspection was completed around 2:00 PM before he returned to Taicang.</p>

<p>Requesting Funds for Emergency Repairs on the Second Section of the Sea Dike. In addition to the third and fourth sections of the Songjiang Sea Dike Post-Disaster Project, which have been completed as scheduled, Xu Baikui, Director of the Jiangnan Sea Dike Songjiang Section Engineering Office, has also prepared budgets for the emergency repairs of other sections, explaining the extent of the dangers and submitting them to the Dike Works Committee and the Construction Department for funding requests. It is reported that the second section of the dike is the most dangerous, as no post-disaster work has been carried out since the danger occurred last year. Not only have the wood pilings rotted, but the dike foundation has also been washed away in several places. In addition, there are no large stones in the middle of the old dike in this section. In the event of a sudden storm surge, the danger is extremely worrying. Therefore, more than ten zhang of dike soil was washed away during the strong wind the night before. Su, Director of the Construction Department, also visited Songjiang to inspect and recognized the importance of the section's engineering. According to the Type A wood-stone engineering plan prepared by the office, the cost of labor and materials requires 77,792 yuan. Director Xu has reported this to the Construction Department and consulted with the Jiangnan Dike Works Committee, requesting the prompt issuance of funds to prepare for construction as soon as possible to prevent unforeseen events. This matter concerns the lives of the people of Songyi, and everyone hopes for repairs to begin as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Situation of the Nine-County Joint Defense Conference. The last issue of this newspaper briefly reported that the Wu-Kun-Jiang-Qing and other nine-county joint defense conference held its third meeting in Kunshan on the 12th. It is now known that the meeting was chaired by Zou Jing, the magistrate of Wu County, and the following resolutions were made: (1) The public security bureaus and district offices of each county are responsible for re-checking the population registration; (2) The methods for dealing with roving bandits and disbanded soldiers in each county are stipulated; (3) The fourth meeting will be held in Songjiang on September 9th. Magistrate Zou and others have already returned to Suzhou.</p>
<p>Bandits from Pudong Flee to Zhejiang. Since the summer and autumn, various gangs of river bandits have been plotting uprisings. Although the water police have repeatedly suppressed them, these bandits scatter and gather, making it difficult to eliminate them. Recently, about 300 river bandits from Pudong, divided into more than 20 bandit boats, fled from Dianshan Lake to Wusong Port and sneaked into Zhejiang Province. Shen, the district chief of the third water police district, reported the above to the commander and ordered the Zhenwei two patrol ships to join the fourteenth and fifteenth teams to head to Wusong Port for interception on the 13th.</p>
<p>Xu Yabo Case Scheduled for Sentencing. Xu Yabo, the former chief of the first water police district, who refused to accept the first-instance verdict in the case of conspiracy and robbery, appealed to the High Court. Yesterday was the continuation of the trial. The court session was held in the third criminal court at 10:00 AM. Judge Song Yuan and prosecutor Wang Shicheng were present. Only witness Pan Guangxi reported, and all other witnesses were absent. After a long investigation, Xu Yabo claimed to be falsely accused. Subsequently, Xu's lawyers Chen Zhengmin, Fei Tinghuang, and Xu Helin stood up to defend him successively. After the prosecutor's statement, the court ordered the debate to end and scheduled the sentencing for 8:00 AM on the 18th. Xu was still remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Faculty and Students of Soochow University Aid Volunteer Army. In view of the fact that volunteer armies in Northeast China were fighting bravely in the battlefield under the scorching sun, the faculty and students of Soochow University in Suzhou initiated an on-campus fundraising campaign to provide material support to the volunteer army. Faculty, staff, and students actively donated. Other schools are also in the process of organizing.</p>

<p>Tax Inspectors Illegally Detained. Xie and Gao, two inspectors from the county's stamp tax bureau, went to Zhenze in the county to check store stamps the day before. On the spot, they seized 65 books of records. Inspector Xie arbitrarily imposed a fine of 95 yuan. Xu Ziyi, chairman of the Zhenze District Chamber of Commerce, learned that the inspectors dared to impose fines privately, which violated the stamp tax trial regulations. He immediately telegraphed the local public security bureau to detain them temporarily for transfer to the county for legal action. After the stamp tax bureau received the news, it immediately sent Yu Boliang to mediate. The inspectors have been temporarily released on bail.</p>

<p>County Bureau Issues Proclamation on Levying Business Tax. Since the implementation of the business tax in Jiangsu Province, disputes have arisen repeatedly. Recently, the newly revised provisional regulations on business tax have been issued, and the tax rates have been revised, ordering all counties to uniformly levy taxes in the autumn of this year. However, chambers of commerce in various places have repeatedly requested a reduction in tax rates. The Wuxi County Government and the Business Tax Collection Bureau jointly issued a proclamation yesterday, ordering uniform compliance with the tax levy. The original text reads roughly as follows: "Having examined the newly revised provisional regulations on business tax and the revised tax rates, we are ordered to comply with and implement them. Therefore, starting from the autumn of this year, whether wholesale or retail, all taxes will be levied according to the newly set tax rates and classifications. All taxes not paid in the autumn and winter of last year and the spring of this year will still be paid directly to the bureau in full within 20 days according to the old tax rates for reporting and submission. At the same time, those who have not yet filled out and submitted declaration forms must truthfully fill them out and submit them to the bureau within five days for review and tax levy. If they continue to refuse to declare, or refuse investigation, or make false declarations, or attempt to evade taxes, conceal books, or forge accounts and certificates, the director of this office will strictly enforce the law and severely punish them."</p>

<p>Villagers in the Eighth District Expel the District Chief. Recently, in Zhouzhuang Town in the eighth district, a drought and epidemic have broken out, first in the rural areas and then in the markets. The rural areas are scattered and increasingly widespread, and deaths have followed one another. Local people in the township were confused by superstition and pooled money to hire Taoist priests to build a Taiping Gong Jiao ceremony. Yesterday (the 12th), they wanted to borrow the Eighth District Office as a Taoist ritual site for four days. Xu Lianqu, the district chief, refused. Hundreds of people gathered and shouted to expel the district chief. Xu, seeing that the situation was unfavorable, fled to the city and stayed at the Huayuan Hotel. Soon, Miao Lunqian and Chen Zhongda, fearing that the matter would escalate, tried their best to mediate and allowed the district office to be borrowed as a Taoist ritual site, and peace was restored.</p>

<p>All Public Security Sub-bureaus in the Four Rural Districts Abolished. Because there are no fixed funds and the daily measures are unpopular, all public security sub-bureaus and branch offices in the four rural districts of Nantong, totaling more than 20, were abolished according to a resolution passed at the county administrative meeting on the 12th. All security will be the responsibility of the defense corps. According to the interpretation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, public security administration will be handled by the district offices. However, in prosperous cities and towns, those that must be established for commercial purposes must have more than 1,000 merchants and a local monthly business donation income of more than 240 yuan before they can apply for approval to establish a sub-bureau or branch office. The jurisdiction is limited to the city or town. The police officers in each abolished sub-bureau and branch office will be issued retirement certificates by the county public security bureau. After assessment, they may be given priority for supplemental recruitment in the county public security bureau, county police team, and district defense corps.</p>

<p>Yi Ruichang Sues Wang Yuanchen Again. Wang Yuanchen, the president of the Provincial Hospital, was previously introduced to Yi Ruichang by Liu Yusheng of the Jiangsheng Newspaper to treat his leg injury, but the wrong leg bone was connected. They sued each other, and the case was widely reported in the provincial capital. Recently, Wang claimed that Yi's illness was incurable (and he had been hospitalized for nearly two years, paying 100 yuan in medical expenses. According to the settlement, medical expenses and other fees amounted to more than 1,900 yuan). Moreover, the Provincial Hospital is publicly established and cannot afford the expenses, so Yi was carried to the Jiangsheng Newspaper and returned to the introducer. On that day, Wang took two weeks of leave to go to Lushan for summer vacation and was scheduled to return to Zhenjiang around the 16th. During this period, Huang Shengbai was responsible for the hospital affairs. However, Yi sued Wang in court for abandonment. Wang was unable to attend the court session the other day because he was not in Zhenjiang. It is now heard that the hearing has been rescheduled.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Draft National Physical Education Implementation Plan (1) <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The National Physical Education Implementation Plan was drafted by Messrs. Wu Yunrui, Yuan Dunli, and Hao Gengsheng at the request of the National Physical Education Conference Preparatory Committee. It will be submitted to the conference for discussion. The draft is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>｜Table of Contents｜ I. Introduction, II. Objectives, III. Administration and Facilities, (I) Administrative and Organizational System, (II) Equipment, (III) Funding, IV. Methods for Promoting Physical Education, (I) Research Work, (II) Training of Personnel, (III) Standards for the Implementation of Physical Education, (IV) Promoting and Rewarding Various Physical Education Gatherings and Organizations, (V) Methods for Evaluating Physical Education, V. Phased Implementation Plan</p>
<p>(I) Introduction: To solve a problem, one must first understand the meaning and scope of the problem itself, and then discuss solutions. The meaning of the term "physical education" varies greatly in different eras and societies, and people generally have different understandings of physical education. If its meaning is not clarified and its scope defined first, and an implementation plan is hastily stipulated, it will not only be difficult to know where to start, but even after implementation, it is likely that the result will deviate from the original intention, which is extremely dangerous. Therefore, before drafting this plan, the meaning and scope of physical education must be briefly stated. In the eyes of ordinary people, physical education is nothing more than physical exercise. However, since the development of biology and psychology, the traditional dualistic theory of mind and body has ceased to exist, and the purpose of modern education is not only to provide knowledge, but also to train the entire organism for life. Therefore, we have come to deeply understand that although physical education appears to be large muscle activity, it causes many physiological and psychological changes, and it is an indispensable method for training the entire organism for life. Therefore, the meaning of physical education is not only physical exercise, but also providing educational opportunities through various large muscle activities of the body. In other words, to achieve various educational goals, physical activity is a major means and method. The development and health promotion of the organism is a natural result of physical activity. Physical education not only achieves this goal, but also has other important educational goals, such as social morality, basic life skills, methods for making good use of leisure time, and the attitudes and abilities that citizens must possess, all of which can be trained and cultivated through various physical activities. Therefore, physical education and education cannot be separated into two. The only difference is that physical education uses large muscle activity of the body as a method to achieve educational goals, while education uses other methods in addition to physical education to achieve its goals. Therefore, all physical education facilities must be based on the standard of being able to achieve the entire educational purpose. At the same time, anything that does not use large muscle activity of the body as an educational method cannot be called physical education. For the sake of a clear understanding of the scope of physical education, the following points must be explained here:</p>
<p>(I) Physical Education and Military Training: The purpose of military training is to provide citizens with military knowledge, train citizens' ability to defend against insults, and cultivate citizens' national consciousness. The current military training in schools at all levels focuses on infantry drills, and because the training is not strict enough, not only is it difficult to achieve the true purpose of military training, but even soldiers who blindly obey orders and are not afraid of death cannot be obtained. To achieve the purpose of military training, on the one hand, it is necessary to strive for the development of science and industry, and the stability and consolidation of society and the economy. On the other hand, in addition to providing citizens with strict and thorough training in military life at a considerable age, it is necessary to cultivate national consciousness and the ability to defend against insults in many invisible ways. All subjects in schools must take this as their purpose, especially history, geography, and civics, which are the most effective. As for physical education, it provides citizens with fully developed bodies and brave and agile spirits, which contributes greatly to achieving the purpose of military training invisibly. It goes without saying that if infantry drills are regarded as physical education and used as the main method of military national training, then what could be more absurd? Therefore, in addition to the inherent value of physical education, which indirectly contributes to military training, the government has other methods for all aspects of military training, and there is no need to involve it.</p>
<p>(II) Physical Education and Hygiene and Health Education: Because physical education can promote development and health, it is often regarded as a part of hygiene, or hygiene as a part of physical education. In fact, the two have their own scope and cannot be mixed into one. From a social perspective, hygiene is one of the important functions of the government, including the supply of medicine, the improvement of the environment, the prevention of diseases, and the facilities for public health training and guidance. From a school perspective, health is one of the most important goals of education, including health protection and inspection, environmental hygiene facilities, and the establishment of appropriate health education. Health is an element of life, and education must be related to actual life. All activities and facilities in schools must have the meaning and components of health education. Since physical education is one of the subjects and activities in schools, it naturally makes a considerable contribution to health education. It has been said before that the inevitable result of physical education is to promote the development and health of the organism. This is its greatest contribution to health education. However, in addition to this inevitable health result, physical education has other major contributions to education. Moreover, the constituent elements of physical education are purely large muscle activities, while the constituent elements of health education are contained in all school activities and teaching. Therefore, although physical education and health education both belong to the scope of education, there is actually a great difference between them. This plan can only be based on the scope of physical education and does not involve hygiene and health education.</p>
<p>(III) Physical Education and Labor: Since physical education is the activity of large muscles, it is often considered similar to labor. Some even advocate replacing physical education with labor. However, the purpose and meaning of the two are different. The purpose of labor is production, and the purpose of physical education is education. Labor is sometimes harmful to the body of children, so it is not suitable for underage children to work. This has long been recognized by sociologists and educators. Physical education is the only tool for developing the body and mind. If productive labor is used to replace children's games and sports, there is nothing more depriving of children's opportunities for development and education. Labor is the work of adults, and physical education is entertainment. Work is necessary for life, and appropriate entertainment is also indispensable for life. Moreover, the various educational goals that physical education wants to achieve, as mentioned above, cannot be achieved by labor. Therefore, those who advocate replacing physical education with labor are too trusting in utilitarianism and neglecting the various educational meanings within physical education.</p>
<p>(IV) Physical Education and Boy Scouts: The Boy Scouts were originally designed to train young people in the skills of serving as scouts in wartime. It has gradually developed into an organized and multi-faceted youth training program. Its main content is to provide young people with opportunities to contact nature and the actual society, so as to cultivate various life skills and proper attitudes towards people and things. Its organization method is purely extracurricular activities in schools. Thus, what is learned in the school classroom is practiced in this extracurricular design. Therefore, the Boy Scouts are actually an entire educational design, reaching their own special goals. Physical education cannot replace the Boy Scouts, just as the Boy Scouts cannot replace physical education. As for the various physical activities and skill tests practiced by the Boy Scouts, they are certainly not unrelated to physical education. Because it is an entire educational design, it is natural to adopt many physical education activities and materials. However, it goes without saying that this kind of physical education activities and materials should have considerable contact with the school's physical education curriculum.</p>
<p>(V) The Status of National Martial Arts in Physical Education: National martial arts are a unique physical activity method of our nation. On the one hand, it can provide self-defense skills, and on the other hand, it can be used as a tool for physical exercise. It not only has its fixed value in national history, but it is also not unscientific when observed from the perspective of modern science such as anatomy and physiology. Promoting and researching it is a necessity today. However, learning has no national boundaries, and human nature is the same regardless of origin. All kinds of physical education activities that do not violate scientific principles and can suit human nature should be promoted equally according to the domestic social situation. There should be no distinction based on the location of their origin. Therefore, national martial arts are actually a kind of physical education activity and should not be given a special status because they are unique to our country, so as to abandon other physical education activities that are in line with science and education. On the other hand, since learning has no national boundaries, our country's national martial arts should strive for its development in the international arena and should not regard it as a rare commodity to be hoarded. Looking at Japanese judo, it has recently been learned by many people in Europe and the United States, let alone the profundity of our country's national martial arts, which is far above it? As for domestic physical education experts, they should pay close attention to and study national martial arts deeply, while national martial artists should also have a considerable understanding of modern physical education and its basic subjects. This is the necessary path for developing and researching national martial arts.</p>
<p>(II) Objectives (I) Provide citizens with opportunities for full physical development, (II) Train citizens' ability to use their bodies flexibly to adapt to the environment, (III) Cultivate citizens' spirit of cooperation and solidarity, (IV) Cultivate citizens' style of chivalry and bravery, (V) Cultivate citizens' habit of using sports and games for entertainment.</p>
<p>(III) Administration and Facilities (I) Administrative and Organizational System: In China, in addition to the Department of Social Affairs of the Ministry of Education being in charge of mass sports, there are no other fixed administrative organs in the central administration of physical education. As a result, various physical education facilities lack a systematic plan and it is difficult to have good results. Although the National Physical Education Law has been promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, it has not been implemented to this day. Regardless of whether it is appropriate or not, it is equivalent to a dead letter. Based on the above-mentioned meaning and scope of physical education, and with reference to the organization of China's central administration, it is necessary today to establish a physical education committee within the Ministry of Education to manage all physical education administration in the country. All central administrative matters related to physical education must be passed by this committee to be effective, so that national physical education can be developed as a whole, consistently, and in a planned manner. However, the committee must be organized by recruiting outstanding physical education experts from all over the country. It cannot be stationed in Beijing all the time. It can only have regular gatherings. Therefore, there must be someone who is stationed in the Ministry of Education to implement the resolutions of the committee. Therefore, a physical education supervisor must be established in the Ministry of Education to take charge of this position. As for the Central Mass Sports Field, according to reason, it should be under the jurisdiction of the Department of Social Affairs of the Ministry of Education and should be handed over immediately in order to seek the unity of things. The draft outline of the committee's organization and the table of the central administrative system are listed below:</p>

At 50 meters, Kawazu and Zawa were almost equal, the two engaged in a fierce battle, showing their skills like dragon gods, with splashes flying far away, closely following Irie, forming a major three-way battle. Irie continued to swim hard, still ahead of the two. Kiyokawa made a final great effort, leaping ahead of Irie and finally winning first place by a difference of 2.5 meters. Irie was second, and Kawazu and Zawa fought fiercely until the very end, with Kawazu finally defeating Zawa and taking third place, ending the day beautifully for the Japanese team.</p>

<p>81 (73) I can't stand being a mute all the time, now is my time to speak. I say (the horsepower that burns white coal without working is still a lot. 2.6 million soldiers are 325,000 horsepower that do not produce. More than 14.3 million teachers and students are 1.8 million horsepower that do not produce. The 16 million wives, misses, and young mistresses in the city are another 2 million horsepower that do not produce. These more than 4 million horsepower are really strange, they don't work but they want to burn foreign top-quality coal! I advocate that wives, misses, young mistresses, teachers, students, and soldiers weave their own cloth and wear it themselves. This contains two important relationships. (1) Weaving your own cloth and wearing it yourself is a meaningful movement. You won't wear coarse cloth that you buy, but no matter how coarse the cloth you weave yourself is, you feel that it is more beautiful than brocade because it is the crystallization of your own labor. (2) Wearing cloth that you weave yourself will naturally boycott foreign goods.) Mr. Tang said: (That's very interesting.) Mr. Zhu: (This can be said to be a doctrine of necessity, because if you don't do this, you will perish.) I said: (Upon closer examination, weaving your own cloth and wearing it yourself is not a difficult task at all. Each person wears an average of ten feet of cloth a year. Each foot of cloth requires about one catty of yarn. It takes about three days to spin one catty of yarn and one day to weave ten feet of cloth, so it is completely completed in forty days. Farmers have five months of free time, take forty days of it, and they still have one hundred and ten days to do other things. Soldiers can just reduce one hour of military eight-legged essays every day. Wives, misses, and young mistresses can also skip two rounds of mahjong every day. What about teachers and students? Spending half of a summer vacation or a winter vacation should not be considered delaying their bookworm life.) Mr. Tang said: (Someone has invented a hand-operated spinning machine that can spin more than two pounds of yarn per person per day, but the yarn spun is uneven, so it has failed in the past. I think you don't care about aesthetics, so why not try this spinning machine. If it works, spinning and weaving for one day can produce ten feet of cloth, wouldn't that be much more convenient?) Mr. Zhu said: (That's very good. I need to trouble you to introduce one. We can study and transform this spinning machine, and if we can make the yarn it produces even, that would be great. In short, we are willing to give it a try.)</p>

<p>But Wang's Attitude Was Resolute, and He Refused to Withdraw His Resignation</p>
<p>The Representatives Then Separately Reported to the Central Government and Chiang</p>
<p>Tang Youren Returned to Shanghai Yesterday After Reporting in Nanjing; The Central Government Emphasizes Chairman Chiang's Opinion Regarding the Resignation of Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei and Is Still Exerting Utmost Efforts to Retain Him. However, for Days, Representatives from Various Parties, Except for One Formal Meeting with Wang on the Third Day After His Arrival in Shanghai, Have Been Received by Madam Wang. Until Yesterday, Three Representatives, Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, and Zhu Peide, Had Their Second Meeting with Wang. According to Discussions, Wang's Resignation Intention Has Not Been Dismissed, but He Is Considered a Courageous and Responsible Person, and an Appropriate Solution Will Be Found Soon.</p>
<p>Second Meeting to Persuade Wang to Stay: For Days, the Central Government, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, He Yingqin, Song Ziwen, and Song Peide Negotiated with Madam Chen Bijun, Wang Jingwei's Wife. After Madam Wang Conveyed He, Song, and Others' Intentions to Wang Himself, Wang Seemed Slightly Moved, and They Agreed to a Second Formal Meeting Yesterday Afternoon. In the Afternoon, Wang First Returned to His Residence on Rue Bourgeat at 12:35 PM to Wait. Song, He, and Zhu Then Arrived at Wang's Residence Together at 2:20 PM to Visit Wang. Madam Chen Bijun Was Also Present. The Three Representatives Sincerely Urged Wang to Stay Again and Requested Him to Go to Nanjing Soon to Resume His Duties. Wang's Attitude Remained Resolute, Believing That His Resignation Was the Best Way to Eliminate Irresponsible Military Personnel. Therefore, He Was Determined to Sacrifice His Personal Position to Achieve Military Unification. After Song and Others Repeatedly Urged Him to Resume His Position, Wang Finally Refused to Withdraw His Resignation. Finally, the Representatives Asked Wang to Give Serious Consideration to the Hopes of the Central Government and Chairman Chiang, but the Meeting Ended Without Result Around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Separate Letters to Nanjing and Hankou: Song, He, and Zhu Left Wang's Residence and Went to Song's Residence on Qiqi Road to Consult. They Decided to Report the Situation of the Meeting with Wang Separately to the Central Government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Hankou and to Exchange Ideas on How to Persuade Wang to Stay. They Dispersed at 4:45 PM.</p>
<p>He Yingqin's Remarks: According to Central Representative He Yingqin's Interview with a Reporter from the New Voice News Agency, Today (Yesterday) Was the Second Meeting with President Wang. Representatives from All Parties Exerted Utmost Efforts to Persuade Wang to Stay. Wang Has Not Yet Expressed Any Intention to Dismiss His Resignation. However, Mr. Wang Is a Courageous and Responsible Person. I (He Himself) Believe That There Will Be a Reasonable Solution in the Next Few Days. As for the Premature Convocation of the Third Plenary Session, I Have Not Heard of It. I Don't Think Such a Move Will Occur. As for Returning to Nanjing, It Is Unlikely to Happen in the Next Day or Two.</p>
<p>Gan Naiguang's Remarks: Gan Naiguang, Vice Minister of the Interior, Arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the Day Before Yesterday Evening. He Visited Wang Yesterday Morning and Then Released a Statement to a Reporter from the New Voice News Agency. The Central Government Has Not Yet Decided on Any Solution to the Resignations of President Wang and Director Zhang. Chairman Chiang's Opinion Will Be the Main Consideration. As Tang Youren Said After Returning to Shanghai, Representatives from All Parties Will Probably Continue to Exert Utmost Efforts to Persuade Wang to Stay.</p>
<p>German Consul Explores Political Situation: After Wang's Resignation, All Countries Paid Close Attention to the Development of Our Political Situation. In Addition to the Consuls General of the United States and Italy Visiting Mayor Wu to Inquire, Count Arenberg, the German Consul General, Also Visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 9:30 AM Yesterday to Inquire About Everything. Wu Told Him That All Parties Were Actively Trying to Persuade Wang to Stay and That the Situation Would Be Resolved Soon, and There Were No Major Problems in the Political Situation.</p>
<p>Yu, Tang, and Others Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday: Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning After Reporting in Nanjing, Along with Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan. They Arrived in Shanghai Around 8:00 AM Yesterday Morning on the Overnight Train from Nanjing. After Arriving in Shanghai, Yu and Tang Returned to Their Residences to Rest. Tang Had a Light Meal and Then Visited Wang to Report. It Is Said That Yu Came Specifically to Treat His Stomach Problems and Beriberi, so He Does Not Intend to Express Any Political Opinions.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Flying Arrows Were Tested Yesterday <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Invented by Huang Tingyu of Northeast China</p>
<p>The Garrison Command Also Sent Personnel to Monitor Huang Tingyu, Who Served in the Northeast Army for Many Years, Is Enthusiastic About National Affairs, and Has Recently Invented a Flying Arrow After Repeated Research. It Is Specifically for Aerial Defense. He Previously Conducted an Experiment in Beiping, and the Altitude Reached 5,000 Meters, Which Was Highly Praised by Zhou Dawen, the Mayor of Beiping. He Recently Came to Shanghai and Reached an Agreement with the Garrison Command. Yesterday Afternoon at 2:00 PM, He Conducted a Live Test at the Longhua Airfield, Open to Public Viewing. The Garrison Command Also Sent Personnel to Monitor. Huang First Explained the Internal Structure of the Flying Arrow in Detail. The Arrow Is Several Feet Long, with the Top Filled with Explosives and the Tail in a Triangular Shape. Huang and His Assistants Then Placed the Flying Arrow in a Circular Iron Tube and Ignited the Fuse. With a Loud Boom, the Flying Arrow Soared into the Sky and Exploded in the Air. However, the Explosive Force Was Not Great. The First Two Arrows Only Reached Several Hundred Meters, and the Last One Reached More Than a Thousand Meters. In Fact, Its Effectiveness in Bombarding Aircraft Is Still Limited. However, Huang's Spirit and Perseverance Are Admirable. When a Reporter Asked Huang About This, He Said That He Would Continue to Work Hard to Meet the Expectations of the People. He Also Said That When Bombarding Aircraft in Actual Combat, a Protractor Should Be Prepared to Measure the Area of the Flying Arrow's Explosive Force in the Air, Which Is About 50 Meters.</p>

<p>Recently, the Educational Associations of All Districts of This City, in Light of Japan's Seizure of Customs Posts and Intrusion into Rehe, and Even More So the Propaganda of Sending a Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Recognize the Puppet Organization Before the League of Nations Meeting, Sent a Telegraph to the League of Nations Investigation Team Yesterday to Uphold Justice. The Original Telegram Is As Follows: (To Gu Weijun, Representative in Beiping, Please Forward to Sir Lytton and All Members of the League of Nations Investigation Team. Japan Disregards Public Reason and Justice, Disregards International Covenants, Destroys the Nine-Power Treaty and the Pact of Paris, and Groundlessly Seizes Our Three Northeastern Provinces for Nearly a Year. Our Chinese Nation Loves Peace and Has Repeatedly Appealed to the League of Nations, Waiting Quietly for a Fair Disposition. However, Japan Has Become Even More Aggressive. While Your Team Is Conducting Investigations, It Dares to Display Force in Shanghai and Threaten Shanhaiguan, Intrude into Rehe, Seize Customs Posts, and, Using the Old Trick of Annexing Korea, Organize a Puppet Government. Recently, It Even Sent a Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Recognize the Puppet Organization. Its Disregard for the League of Nations Covenant, Destruction of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Pact of Paris Are Obvious Facts and Have Long Been Seen Through by All of You. We Hope You Will Uphold Justice, Report to the League of Nations As Soon As Possible, and Impose Powerful Sanctions. This Is Not Only the Fortune of Our Chinese Nation but Also the Fortune of the World's Future. Respectfully, the Educational Associations of All Districts of Shanghai. ) There Is Also a Telegram to the League of Nations, Which Is Largely the Same and Omitted.</p>

Next Were Speeches from Various Circles, Ending with the Family Expressing Gratitude and Dispersing.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye's Biography: Mr. Ye's Given Name Was Zengming, Style Name Huijun, Also Known As Longsha Lazy Farmer. His Family Was From Shanghai and Resided in Gaohang Township on the Left Bank of the Huangpu River. His Family Had Been Engaged in Farming and Studying for Generations. His Respected Father, Zi Sui, Was a Shopkeeper and Died Early. At the Age of Fourteen, His Mother Sent Him to Shanghai to Study the Soybean and Rice Business. He Was Careful and Meticulous in His Work. After Graduating, He Was Entrusted with Important Responsibilities, and His Reputation Grew Daily. In His Spare Time, He Often Studied Poetry and Books and Had Many Literary Friends From All Over the Country. During the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, Our Teachers Were Defeated Repeatedly. He Grieved and Was Filled With Indignation, and He Had Reformist Ideas. During the Boxer Rebellion of Gengzi, National Affairs Were Almost Beyond Salvage. At This Point, He Knew That the Qing Society Was About to Collapse, So He Anxiously Worked With Like-Minded Local People to Seek Self-Strengthening. From Then On, He Presided Over the Shanghai Gymnastics Association and Then the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Regiment. He Was Very Active in His Duties and Worked Hard on Opium Prohibition. In the Late Qing Dynasty, He Joined the Tongmenghui and Secretly Planned Revolutionary Strategies With Shen Manyun, Zhu Shaoqi, and Other Comrades. He Organized the Patriotic Association and the National Chamber of Commerce Regiment, and He Was Elected As Their Leader. During the Wuchang Uprising, He, Chen Qimei, Li Pingshu, and Other Gentlemen Planned to Respond. On September 13 of That Year, He Supervised and Led the Regiment to Attack the Manufacturing Bureau, Fighting Fiercely for a Day and Night, and Capturing It. Shanghai Was Liberated, and the Overall Situation Was Settled. He Contributed Greatly. After the Establishment of the Shanghai Military Government, He Was Recommended As the Military and Political Commander, Presiding Over Local Defense, and Concurrent Chief of Staff of the Governor's Office. On New Year's Day of the Republic of China, He Led 300 Warriors to Accompany Mr. Sun Yat-Sen to the Capital to Assume the Position of Provisional President. He Was Appointed As the Police Chief of the Presidential Palace. Because His Duties in Shanghai Were Numerous and Burdensome, He Resigned. He Then Served As the Chief of the Tongfu Office's Railway Section. For Two Years, He Devoted Himself to Local Construction and Served As the Director of the Materials Department of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau. At That Time, President Yuan Shikai Conspired to Become Emperor. The Kuomintang's Punishment Failed. Because of His Previous Party Membership, Yuan Ordered Zheng Ruicheng, the Shanghai Garrison Commander, to Arrest Him, Offering 5,000 Gold Pieces. He Then Went to Japan in the East to Avoid Calamity Temporarily and Investigate the Politics of That Country. Later, He Lived in Dalian, Keeping a Low Profile. After Yuan's Defeat and Death, He Returned to Shanghai to Revitalize Industry. He Served As a Business Hub, Benefiting All Industries. He Was Particularly Involved in the Soybean, Rice, Miscellaneous Grains, and Oil Cakes Industries, Which Were Essential to People's Livelihoods. In Addition, He Participated in All Local Public Welfare Undertakings. Last Year, When the Sino-Japanese War Broke Out Again, He Grieved Greatly Over Liaoning and Songhu. He Devoted Himself to the Shanghai National Salvation Volunteer Army, Serving As a Backing for the National Army. However, the Authorities Advocated Peace, and His Righteous Indignation Could Not Be Vented. From Then On, His Body Often Felt Uncomfortable. He Accidentally Took a Laxative, Which Greatly Damaged His Vitality, and the Tumor in His Abdomen Was Hidden. This Spring, the Government Convened a National Crisis Conference in Luoyang. He Responded to the Call While Supporting His Sick Body. When the Boat Arrived in Nanjing, He Had to Turn Back Due to Physical Exhaustion. The Tumor in His Abdomen Became Severe, and All Medicines Failed. He Was Bedridden for Months and Died at the Age of Seventy on July 15 of the 21st Year of the Republic of China. When All Sectors Heard the News, They Were All Saddened Because of His Contributions to His Hometown and Country. The Shanghai Soybean, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grains Industries Were Even More Saddened Because They Had Benefited So Much From Him in the Past. They Gathered Together to Discuss and Schedule a Memorial Service to Express Their Mourning and Respect.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye's Will: A Special Issue Was Distributed at the Meeting, Carrying One of Mr. Ye's Calligraphic Works. From This, We Can See Mr. Ye's Lofty Spirit of Devoting Himself to the Revolution and Not Taking Credit for His Success. The Letter Reads, "Brother Remembers Since Separating From Jingmo in Shanghai in the Year of Xinhai, I Have Been Grateful for Your Attention, Despite My Mediocrity. I Heard From Friends Coming From the North That You and Gong Chang Often Ask About My Situation. I Can See Your Deep Friendship and High Regard, Which Is Endlessly Engraved in My Heart. However, Brother's Nature Is Foolish and Awkward, Out of Sync With the Times. When Yuan Was in Power, I Ran Around in Foreign Lands and Buried Myself in Penghu Island for Two Years. There Were Countless Setbacks. Recalling the Beginning of the Restoration, Colleagues All Know My Deeds. However, Thinking That I Am a Citizen, I Should Do My Best to Fulfill My Duties. How Can I Dare to Claim Credit? You Know Me, I Think You Have Long Seen Through It. Fortunately, the Republic Has Been Restored. Brother Returned to Shanghai From Dalian Last Winter. Old Friends Like Yingshi and Manyun Have Passed Away One After Another..." (Omitted Below) Summary of Speeches: Wang Xiaolai Said, "Mr. Ye Often Encouraged Us to Be 'Foolishly Great' to the End. Now, When Foreign Troubles and Domestic Woes Invade Each Other, Mr. Ye Has Passed Away. We Can Only Continue Mr. Ye's Spirit, Rise Up and Be 'Foolishly Great', and Fight Forward. Otherwise, It Will Be a Dead End." Pan Gongzhan Said, "Mr. Ye Has Three Spirits That Are Most Worth Remembering. First, He Is Diligent, Punctual, and Has a Strict and Uncompromising Spirit. Second, He Can Encourage the Younger Generation to Move Forward, With the Spirit of Helping Others Succeed and Helping Others Achieve." Third, He Is Always Optimistic, Does More and Says Less, and Has a Down-to-Earth Spirit. Wang Yansong Said, "On the One Hand, We Should Strive to Be a Backing for the Government and Seek to Improve the Status of the Country. On the Other Hand, We Hope That Business Organizations Will Consolidate to Improve Welfare and Relieve Suffering." Lin Kanghou Said, "Mr. Ye Has Three Characteristics: (1) Integrity, (2) Law-Abiding, and (3) Responsibility. It Is Truly Rare and Valuable." Qu Shao-yi Said, "Mr. Ye Is an Old Revolutionary But Has No Revolutionary Face. He Is Always Sincere and His True Nature Is Touching, Which Is Inimitable." Wang Shou-yi Said, "If Everyone Can Uphold Mr. Ye's Spirit of Serving the Country and Society, They Will Not Let Down Mr. Ye." Lu Wenshao Reported Mr. Ye's Contributions to the Soybean, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grains Industries, As Well As His Diligence and Fairness.</p>

<p>Pay Attention to Their Transactions With Money Houses</p>
<p>And Where the Goods Are Sold</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Announced to All Compatriots Yesterday, "To All Patriotic People in the City, Since Traitorous Merchants Violated the Covenant and Sold Japanese Goods on a Large Scale, We Have Been Assisted in Investigations by Enthusiastic People From All Walks of Life. We Are Sincerely Grateful for Any Information Received. However, This Kind of Treacherous Action Is Extremely Changeable and Bizarre. It Is Difficult to Obtain the Truth Through External Investigation. We Especially Hope That Employees and Shop Assistants Employed by Traitorous Merchants Will Uphold Their Patriotic Conscience and Notify This Association at Any Time by Letter. In Addition to Describing the Facts of Selling Japanese Goods in the Letter, the Two Most Important Points Are: (1) What Is the Brand Name of the Money House That the Traitorous Merchant Transacts With? (2) Where Are the Goods Sold? Please Do Not Avoid Suspicions and Resentments and Accurately Report to Help This Association, Which Is to Love and Protect the Country. This Is Most Desirable.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Wrote to the Coal Industry Association Yesterday, "Respectfully, On the 10th of This Month, We Received a Letter From the Shipping Industry Association Stating That Coal for Ships Is a Major Expense, and Japanese Coal Is a Huge Amount of Sales in the Market. Since the National Crisis, Changing to National Coal Is the Desire of Everyone. However, the Current Price of Japanese Coal Is Only Six or Seven Taels per Ton, While National Coal Requires About Ten Taels per Ton, a Great Difference. Although Coal Consumption Varies From Ship to Ship, It Is Estimated That Each Ship Requires About 20 Tons per Day. If the Price Difference Is Three or Four Taels, Each Ship Will Need to Spend More Than a Hundred Taels per Month. This Means That Our Commercial Ships Pay the Difference Between the Value of National Coal and Japanese Coal, Which Requires Millions of Taels a Year. However, Foreign Ships Mostly Purchase Japanese Coal and Have Long-Term Contracts With Japanese Coal Merchants, Reducing Costs. Competing With Our Commercial Ships, Which Have Higher Coal Prices, Will Inevitably Lead to Losses, Which Will Lead to Stagnation. If Closed Down, Although National Coal Has Been Changed to, Shipping Rights Will Be Completely Occupied. This Is Not a Good Plan. No Wonder Shipowners Are Hesitant. In Order to Protect Shipping Rights and Promote National Coal, How Should We Negotiate the Difference in Prices of National Coal With the Coal Industry? We Urge the Government to Grant Special Relief to Protect National Rights and Maintain Commercial Shipping. For This Reason, We Have Written Truthfully. We Hope You Will Conduct Detailed Assessments and Implement Practical Methods to Address the Shared Interests of Shipping Rights and National Coal. We Have Recorded the Case and Sent a Letter. We Hope Your Association Will Formulate a Plan and Respond to the Meeting for Handling."</p>

<h3 id="e123">British Merchant Public Bus Company Implements Hiring New Workers <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>After the strike of the British Merchant China Public Bus workers in the Public Concession, the company still tried to maintain traffic yesterday. The workers originally planned to demonstrate to the company yesterday morning but postponed it due to rain. Meanwhile, they expanded the organization of the strike committee and issued a notice to the workers. The company implemented hiring new workers today, and the situation is still serious. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Strict Precautions: The Sixth District Police Station of the Public Security Bureau and the Gordon Road Police Station of the Public Concession dispatched a large number of armed detectives to be stationed near the company on Connaught Road to prevent demonstrations by striking public bus workers. The strike committee, due to the heavy rain yesterday morning, ordered all workers to postpone the demonstration and instead convened a general meeting at the Renhe Tea House. More than 170 workers attended, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Due to the rain, four representatives were sent to negotiate with the company. (2) If the negotiation failed, it was decided that all members would participate in the armed picket line on the 14th to forcibly stop the buses and expel the White Russians. (3) They would not give up until their goals were achieved.</p>
<p>Protecting Traffic: The company yesterday tried to replace ticketing with inspection and fare checking, and managed to maintain operations. There were fourteen buses on Route 1, seven on Route 2, seven on Route 5, twenty-four on Route 9, and special military express buses. The Public Concession Police notified Chinese and Western detectives to provide strict protection along the way. Fortunately, no conflicts occurred in the evening. Yesterday morning, more than 40 unemployed Chinese workers suddenly came to the company's entrance on Connaught Road, claiming to be unemployed Chinese workers and requesting the company to give them jobs. Factory Director and General Manager of Vehicle Affairs Xiao Date ordered Indian police to expel them, and they dispersed immediately.</p>
<p>Expanding the Strike Committee: The strike committee officially announced to reporters from Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday that the company had previously designated six workers to form a delegation to discuss increasing wages in order to ease the atmosphere among the workers. The current strike committee has twelve members, including the six representatives designated by the company. They resigned after the strike was launched. A motion was made to dismiss them during the general meeting today, and it was decided to add five more members to the strike committee. They also insisted on opposing all scabs and traitors disrupting the strike. Regarding the Municipal Party Headquarters sending personnel to mediate, they opposed any mediation because this strike was a direct issue between workers and capitalists, and they believed that only by using the power of the masses could they win victory.</p>
<p>Hiring New Workers: The British Merchant China Public Bus Company adopted a tough policy towards the striking workers and announced that the strikers would be dismissed and new workers would be hired. Yesterday, Factory Director Xiao Date had already hired a batch of Chinese workers. It was decided that they would gather on the Bund of Nanjing Road this morning, and the company would dispatch a reserved bus to transport them to the company on Connaught Road for training. It was planned to restore public bus services on all routes in the shortest possible time. The company had also negotiated with the Public Concession Police in advance to have the police increase the number of armed detectives to protect the bus and maintain strict vigilance on the Bund of Nanjing Road to prevent striking workers from stopping it.</p>
<p>Party and Government Attitude: The Municipal Party Headquarters did send personnel to investigate the truth about the strike of ticket sellers of the British Merchant China Public Bus Company in the Public Concession to understand the truth, but the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau did not send personnel to investigate. It was rumored that a certain gentleman from the bureau was sent to Renhe Tea House yesterday and Zhu was sent to investigate together with the Municipal Party Headquarters the day before yesterday, but these were not true. The bureau had not made any statement regarding this strike as of yesterday.</p>
<p>Company Statement: The British Merchant Public Bus Company announced yesterday that the total number of striking workers after the sudden strike of ticket sellers was 301 ticket sellers and 48 Korean ticket inspectors. Chinese workers such as drivers, coppersmiths, sweepers, and ticket inspectors were not affected. As for the striking workers, they have not formally presented any conditions to the company. The company has now resolved through a board meeting to announce the dismissal of the strikers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a meeting was convened to solicit opinions. A formal mediation meeting is scheduled. The Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting with labor and management yesterday to discuss the dispute over the closure of the Sanyou Industrial Company's Yinxiang Port factory, and proposed two principles for soliciting opinions. A formal meeting of the Labor-Management Mediation Committee is scheduled for mediation.</p>
<p>Two Principles: At 9:00 AM yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting with labor and management. The attendees included Shen Jiucheng and Wang Xianhua, representatives of Sanyou Industrial Company; Gong Yuting and Xia Zhongzhao, representatives of the 7th District Cotton Textile Industry Union; Wu Guicheng, Chang Shaowen, Wu Qianyi, Zhang Tingliang, Liu Chunquan, Wang Chuncheng, Zhu Hongmo, Hong Jiaben, Wu Renfu, Yuan Zhixian, Xu Rongchang, Gu Shaozhen, Yang Changju, Chang Jiwen, Zhou Bingnian, Hu Xuechuan, Qu Fengzhi, Yao Tingshan, Hong Meishuo, Ma Youqing, Xu Chaonian, Tang Zhixiang, Wang Shaowen, Leng Shimo, Zhu Yushan, Wu Buyun, Zhu Dazhe, Huang Renlin, Bao Boyi, etc.; and Zhou Lianze from the Municipal Party Headquarters. Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, presided over the meeting, and Wang Zhiqin recorded the minutes. The chairman first explained the purpose of the meeting, which was to enable labor and management to understand each other in order to reach an appropriate solution. He also stated that the Social Affairs Bureau had been actively mediating this case with the Municipal Party Headquarters, and two principles had been formulated: (1) to restore a portion of the work first; (2) to restore the rest when the opportunity arises. He specifically sought the opinions of both parties.</p>
<p>Labor and Management Opinions: Subsequently, Shen Jiucheng, the representative of the management, stated the difficulties of not being able to open the factory and expressed that the company's pain over the closure was greater than that of the unemployed. He also submitted a written statement from the company, detailing the various reasons why it could not resume work, stating that the company had exhausted all efforts and considered it carefully. The following is a summary of the statement: (1) The proposal to partially resume work: Given the company's dire situation, there is no hope. Partial resumption of work is also considered difficult. (2) The proposal to relocate to the Hangzhou factory: The Hangzhou factory itself is a yarn factory, although it has weaving machines, it is also for women's work. Recently, due to the sluggish market, most of the original female workers have also suffered unemployment. Therefore, relocation to Hangzhou is absolutely impossible in fact. (3) The proposal to temporarily suspend work at the Yinxiang factory and reopen when the opportunity arises: The Yinxiang factory has been severely ravaged and destroyed, and it has suffered deep wounds and there is no hope of recovery. Therefore, it is impossible to reopen in fact. The labor representative, Yu Ting, explained the various sufferings of the workers since the closure, as well as the company's operating conditions over the years. The workers must resume work now, or at least resume a portion of the work. Subsequently, representatives from both parties expressed their opinions, and as a result, because the opinions of both parties failed to converge, it was decided to end the negotiations. Scheduled Mediation: At the end, the chairman stated that the Social Affairs Bureau would formally convene mediation in the shortest possible time. If mediation fails to be established by the deadline, it can only be submitted to the Municipal Government for arbitration according to law. It is hoped that both parties will give it serious consideration. At the same time, the management representative also stated: (1) The company has already considered it carefully and cannot think of any way. It is hoped that it will not be delayed any longer and that arbitration will be carried out according to law immediately. (2) The meal allowance was originally a temporary relief, but it has been borne for a long time and cannot be continued.</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau received an order from the Municipal Government stating that it had received a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating that the Nantong County Government had stated in a letter that Xiao Shengzong, Chairman of the Shanghai All Circles Comfort Northeast Soldiers Support Association, had stated in a letter that the association's organized propaganda and fundraising teams were distributed inland, in addition to issuing passports and donation slips, and specially requested the Gui County Government to notify its subordinates to provide assistance. In addition, the association's address has now moved to the Xuzhou Guild Hall in Tanjiaqiao, Zhabei, with this statement attached, etc. Check whether the association has been submitted to the provincial authorities for approval on record. If the team is sent to the county to raise donations without instructions, should assistance be provided? Please investigate and reply as to whether the organization of the association is legal. The order was to investigate and give a reply. Director Wu sent personnel to investigate, and it was reported that there was no office of the Shanghai All Circles Comfort Northeast Soldiers Support Association at the Xuzhou Guild Hall in Zhabei. After inquiring about the neighbors and the gatekeeper Shen Jingru, they were all unaware. It is evident that Xiao Shengzong and others fabricated the association's address, used the name to deceive people, which is illegal. It should be thoroughly investigated. However, there is no Xiao Shengzong in the guild hall. The situation has been reported to the Municipal Government for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e129">The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Continues to Receive Reports on the Case of Selling Japanese Rice <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the YUKang warehouse Japanese rice of TongXingtai</p>
<p>There are also 100,000 bags in Yangjiadu, Pudong. Regarding the case of Shu Zhanyuan selling Japanese rice, after the exposure by the Smuggler Investigation Team, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce requested a thorough investigation, and it was found that the red-marked Japanese rice deposited in the YUKang warehouse, in addition to those that have already been shipped out, there are still more than 9,100 bags, which are all owned by TongXingtai Rice Firm. The list was immediately reported to the Standing Committee, and the Standing Committee decided to appoint two Supervisory Committee members to jointly form a special review committee with representatives from the grain and soybean rice industry. The investigation team was also notified to submit evidence to the association before the 15th for review. Now the Chamber of Commerce has received the third report from the team. In addition to the Japanese rice stored in YU Kang by TongXingtai, there is also a huge amount of rice stored in the warehouses in Pudong and Yangjiadu. The current owner, He Jiachun, has secretly left Shanghai for Nagasaki because the matter has been exposed. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Dear Sirs of the General Chamber of Commerce, I would like to inform you that the rice merchant He Jiachun is the owner of TongXingtai Rice Firm. His methods of selling inferior rice are no different from those of the merchant Shu Zhanyuan, and they can be called brothers in arms. Our team has briefly stated this in the letter exposing Shu Zhanyuan, and now after further investigation, this merchant He Jiachun is from the Japanese merchant Nozawa Assistant Foreign Firm and has always colluded with the Japanese, which is well known. The Public Association of Grain, Oil, and Cake inspected He Jiachun's stored rice and found that there were three batches of inferior rice, which were very suspicious, and the punishment method has not yet been determined. Now your association has investigated the YUKang warehouse and found that the more than 9,000 bags of inferior rice of TongXingtai are all owned by He Jiachun. Our team has learned that this merchant He Jiachun has many tricks. In addition to hoarding a large amount of inferior rice in YUKang, he also has 100,000 bags of inferior rice stored in Pudong and Yangjiadu. We earnestly request that your association urgently punish him, notify the warehouses to stop shipping the goods, and that He Jiachun, knowing that the evidence is conclusive and the circumstances are serious, knows that it is difficult to avoid severe punishment, and is trying to clear out the rice stored in Pudong overnight and secretly leave Shanghai to Nagasaki temporarily. It is impossible to allow such a villainous merchant to be at large. How should your association punish him severely? It should be handled immediately. At this critical moment, it is urgent to act quickly. Our team believes that all the inferior rice stored in YUKang and Pudong by the merchant should be confiscated and used as supplies for the Northeast Volunteer Army. As for He Jiachun himself, in addition to the punishment of parading him in a wooden cage, his personality should be declared bankrupt, so that one can be warned to prevent future merchants from daring to do so. This is an opportunity to improve the future of trade. I hope your association will take action quickly. In addition, the merchant Shu Zhanyuan is still trying to defend himself in the newspapers, which is very annoying. Our team does not need to repeat it and has collected and sorted out all the evidence to compile a written report, which will be sent to your association's special committee for handling as soon as possible. Correspondingly, we are writing to inform you. We wish you all the best, from the Merchant Investigation Team."</p>
<h3 id="e130">Jardine Matheson's Telephone Line Cut Off <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Taxpayer Association Sends Letter to the Municipal Council to Strive for Rights</p>
<p>The Taxpayer Association previously sent a letter to the Municipal Council regarding the exemption of telephone charges in areas affected by the war, and has now received a reply from the Council stating that the Waterworks Company and the Telephone Company have indicated that they can handle the matter. The method is roughly the same as the exemption of general tax. The relevant letters are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Taxpayer Association's Letter to the Municipal Council: "According to the letter from Jardine Matheson, the company's business at 1459 Wusong Road was located in the most dangerous area during the January 28th Incident, and the employees fled, and all telephone number 41093 was also immediately discontinued. On May 8th, the Shanghai Telephone Company sent a letter urging to pay the telephone bill of 39 taels of silver from February to the end of July. Our company sent a letter requesting a quarter of exemption, but received no reply. On July 3rd, the company sent another letter demanding two quarters of arrears and threatened to cut the line. On July 4th, our company sent another registered letter stating the previous letter requesting a quarter of exemption and stated that this type of case had been handed over to the Chinese Taxpayer Association for negotiation. Before the resolution, please reserve the right to use it. The company did not reply and cut off the telephone line on August 4th. On August 5th, our company sent someone to negotiate, and Fei Erpei, from the accounting department of the company, knew that he was in the wrong and agreed to waive the reconnection fee to reconnect the line. He still ignored the exemption. However, although our company was only cut off the line for one day, the losses were huge. During the war, as our company was located in this location, the business was suspended, which is known to the whole city. Since the telephone was not used, there is naturally no obligation to pay the fee. The company's arbitrary oppression is disregarding public reason. I don't know what extent your association has negotiated for this type of case. I have long admired your association as the mouthpiece of the concession, and I hope you will uphold justice." The letter also included a copy of the company's letter to the Shanghai Telephone Company. "It is noted that the telephone fee was free during the war, as explained by your council's letter No. 140 on June 17th, which has been handled by the company separately. Now that our association has received such a report, the so-called (uniform and consistent) (no deception to children and adults) method, the telephone company does not want to adopt it at all, and for not paying the phone bill due to reasons beyond the control of the party, it uses high-pressure means to cut off the line. Although the party has argued with reason and regained its original state, the company's act of infringement and the fact that it exercises its rights to infringe on others cannot be eliminated, then the request that the company should bear civil liability for compensation cannot be said to be unreasonable. According to the previous letter, we should send a letter to your council to quickly correct the company's fault."</p>
<p>Taxpayer Association's Reply to Jardine Matheson: "In reply to your letter on August 8th, regarding the Shanghai Telephone Company's refusal to exempt wartime usage fees and the disconnection of the line, we have learned that the company is so overbearing and extremely high-handed. If your company had not argued with reason, the company would have obtained an unjust enrichment through its act of infringement. As for the free telephone during the war, our association has negotiated with the Public Concession Council, and according to the letter from the Council on May 23rd, No. 140, regarding the exemption of telephone and water fees during the war in Hongkou, the two companies have stated that if it is indeed necessary to exempt, they are willing to stop charging immediately. The method of stopping charging is roughly the same as the exemption of general tax, but because the regulations have not been finalized, we can only handle it separately for each user. Most of the users who sent letters to the two companies requesting exemption have been satisfactorily resolved. However, due to contractual relations, water and telephone in the areas affected by the war in Shanghai are still supplied as usual. If the so-called exemption method is implemented excessively, the burden will still fall on other users, which does not seem appropriate.

<p>Luodian Town, Baoshan County, since the Shanghai Incident, the head of the local defense regiment, Ji Hetsun, personally led the team to defend the area and maintain local security, doubling his hard work.

It was only recently discovered, and his whole body was rotten. Local people from all walks of life, in order to recognize the loyalty, bravery, and dedication of Martyr Ji, who sacrificed himself for the country, specially plan to hold a memorial service to comfort the loyal soul. Shi Jingbin, Qian Peisheng, Sun Danshi, Zhu Lenglin, and others were appointed to be responsible for the preparations, which are scheduled to be held on September 4th.

<p>The China Jishanhui recently received a report from Wang Dusheng and Zhang Zepu, the directors of the refugee camps in Liu'an, Huoshan, and other counties in northern Anhui, stating that since the counties of northern Anhui, including Liu'an and Huoshan, were occupied by bandits, the people were displaced and many died. At a time of prolonged drought and rampant epidemics, people died not from bandits but from hunger; if not from hunger, then from disease. Dusheng and others witnessed the tragedy and could not bear to describe it. In addition, the number of deaths increased daily, medicines were in short supply, and coffins were depleted. The southern wind was steaming, and the stench filled the air. Everyone living here felt threatened. Dusheng and others repeatedly deliberated and decided to move the refugees from the Dawangmiao No. 2 Refugee Camp to a safe location. However, Bengbu has been repeatedly disturbed, and the official offices have been destroyed. It is impossible to find suitable houses. As a last resort, we can only write to your association, hoping that you will have mercy and add funds in order to rent a temporary house or build some thatched sheds so that we can relocate as soon as possible. As for the dead refugees, most are wrapped in straw mats. The dead are indeed tragic, but the health of the living is even more important. We plan to provide coffins to the dead refugees, according to the size of their families, and bury them deeply in wooden boxes. We respectfully ask for your decision and reply. The seasonal medicines mailed a few days ago have been received and distributed, but the epidemic is severe and too many medicines are needed. We hope you will generously donate more to save lives. In view of this situation, the association feels extremely sympathetic. In the midst of being unable to plan, we reluctantly save to provide some help, and have telegraphed a reply to consider renting a house to provide coffins and send more medicines in the hope of preserving the lives of the refugees in one case out of ten thousand.</p>

It is hoped that all sectors will quickly donate to spread mercy. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "Xinwei Relief Society, the epidemic in Henan Province is getting worse and worse, and all counties in the province have become epidemic areas. The many medicines donated by your association have now been distributed separately to help the victims. The two types of Tian Eryou and Jing Shenyou are particularly effective. Please give another 7,000 bottles to Li Zizhong, the representative of our association in Shanghai, to collect and send them for distribution.

<p>Because the company failed to register in accordance with the Company Law, China's First Sound Film Company published advertisements in major newspapers in this city to solicit shares. Because the registration procedures were not followed in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law and submitted to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for approval and registration, the Bureau was inevitably concerned with the potential for malpractice. The Bureau ordered the Company to stop soliciting before completing legal procedures. However, the Company still did not comply. Recently, newspapers have reported that Wen Zongyao, the general manager of the Company, and others, have declared their withdrawal from the Company and issued a notice to all subscribers to collect their share payments from the bank that collected the payments. It is now heard that some subscribers of the Company believe that the organization of the Company is illegal and that disputes have recently occurred, which will inevitably cause losses in the future. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau ordered the Shanghai Bank to allow the return of the share payments collected on behalf of the Company. The Bureau believes that the Company illegally solicited shares without registration with the government and as the subscriber had requested the return of payments, it should be handled accordingly. It is heard that the Shanghai Bank has been ordered to comply. If there are any continued requests from the company's subscribers, they should be handled in accordance.</p>

<p>Three Kidnappers Arrested One Escaped After Throwing Away His Gun</p>
<p>At around 9:00 AM yesterday, Jin Jiulin, the superintendent of the Special Agency of the French Concession Police, received a tip that a kidnapping bandit named Han Youwen would be passing by Pingjili Road and requested the police to arrest him immediately. Superintendent Jin immediately ordered detectives Li Yaolong, Zhang Ziying, Qin Youyu, and Cai Jinzhang to disguise themselves and wait in ambush. Shortly after, Han came swaggering by and was intercepted at the entrance of the Pingan Hotel. Han confessed that there were two accomplices, Jiangbei natives Wang Shaoqing and Yu Dashunzi, hiding in a bungalow at 5 Taopeng Road. The detectives, accompanied by Han, and together with the Yulin Road Police, arrested Wang and Yu at the address and brought them directly to the French Concession Police Station. After questioning by the police chief, the two confessed that they had a seven-year-old kidnapping victim, the son of Qian Guanjin, a resident of 7 Pu'enluo Se Road, who was kidnapped from Qian's home on July 20th. The victim's name is Miaofu and he is currently hidden in a small boat in the river at the border of Haig Road and the French Concession. The detectives, after hearing the confession, at 3:00 PM, accompanied by the two bandits, took cars and rushed to the address. They also notified the police chief of the local Public Security Bureau and rushed to intercept a small boat, rescuing the victim on the spot. However, the bandit guarding the victim, who was watching from the shore, saw the police arrive and knew that things were not going well. He hastily threw a pistol into the river and escaped. The detectives chased after him, but were unable to catch him. They retrieved the pistol and, along with the victim, brought him to the police station. They notified the victim's family to take him home first. The bandits were separately detained pending a strict investigation in court.</p>

<p>Changing Japanese Yarn into Double Whale Trademark</p>
<p>The Unscrupulous Merchant Cai Zisheng is handed over to the Public Security Bureau. Cai Zisheng, a native of Xiaoshi, Zhejiang, used to specialize in selling enemy goods. After the January 28th Incident, Cai did not dare to be blatant, but still operated privately. Recently, he has intensified his efforts and even changed the appearance of Japanese yarn, labeling it with the Double Whale trademark of the Qinfeng Yarn Factory, and openly transported it to other ports for sale. This was discovered by Zeng Yi, a customer of the Qinfeng Factory, who immediately began investigating. On the 10th of this month, it was discovered that Cai was storing the counterfeit enemy goods at the North Railway Station, intending to transport them to Xiaoshi. Zeng immediately reported to the Railway Police Department, which dispatched police to detain all 28 packages of enemy goods. Cai was strictly pursued. At 6:00 PM the other day, Zeng learned that Cai was hiding in Room 516 of the Central Hotel in the Public Concession. He reported to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, which dispatched detective Xin Jingsheng and the old gate detective Qiu Sijiu to arrest Cai at the address and take him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, Ye Fu Kang, the lawyer hired by the Qinfeng Factory, arrived at the First Special Court Criminal Division I to act as an agent. He stated that the case was requested by the Public Security Bureau and that the police had sufficient evidence. Therefore, the lawyer did not object to the requested transfer. Subsequently, Zeng Yi submitted a petition stating that the yarn produced by the factory was coarse and black, while the counterfeit enemy goods of the defendant were fine and white, which was obvious proof. When questioned, the defendant denied passing off enemy goods as national goods. Lawyer Ye presented various evidence to prove this. Judge Feng Shide ruled that Cai Zisheng was allowed to be handed over to the Public Security Bureau's detectives for interrogation, as the case was extremely clear.</p>

<p>Shen Luqin Claims to be a Whampoa Student Serving in the 13th Brigade of the 5th Division His Deception Was Exposed When He Intervened in a Dung Dumping Incident A Large Number of Envelopes, Stamps, and Cards Were Also Confiscated</p>
<p>Shen Luqin, a native of Shaoxing, 33 years old, resides with his father-in-law at 48 Anren Street because he is dissatisfied with the actions of his stepmother after his father's death. Shen usually claims to be a graduate of the 4th class of the Infantry Department of the Whampoa Military Academy and is currently a major staff officer in the headquarters of the 13th Brigade of the 5th Division of the Army. He has this rank printed on his business cards and always wears a military uniform, carries a belt, wears leather shoes, and leggings, appearing very energetic, like a senior military officer. Residents in the vicinity, seeing his behavior, all assumed that he must be in an important position in the military, so they did not argue with him whenever incidents occurred. A woman surnamed Zhang from Zhang Rongchang's carpentry shop at 52 Zhangjia Lane, Anping Street, Xinbei Gate, poured excrement from a chamber pot into a ditch the other day. Shen happened to see it and immediately stepped forward to intervene. The woman argued with him a little. Afterwards, Shen reported the situation to the Municipal Health Bureau, which sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which in turn ordered the Second Precinct of the First District to send police to investigate. After receiving the order, Bao Wuqiao, the director of the precinct, dispatched service personnel Fan Quanzhong to investigate. Seeing that Shen's business card stated that he was a graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy, and suspecting that he was a classmate, Fan went to visit Shen. After Shen received him, Fan noticed that his behavior was strange and immediately inquired about the various situations of the Whampoa Military Academy and the 5th Division. However, Shen's answers were fabricated. Fan questioned him again and again. Finally, Shen suddenly said, "Please don't say more. My brain is confused now. I don't know anything." At this point, Fan realized that he was impersonating a military officer and swindling and cheating. He immediately arrested him and searched his bedroom, discovering a seal of the Deputy Adjutant's Office of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade of the 5th Division of the National Revolutionary Army, dozens of envelopes printed with the words "Headquarters," many cards of Chen Lin, the Quartermaster Director of the 26th Regiment of the 13th Brigade of the 5th Division of the National Revolutionary Army, and various stamps, which were taken back to the precinct pending preliminary review.</p>

<p>Yesterday, more than 100 refugees from the Jiangxi Guild Hall in this city requested relief. These refugees are from Ruijin and Shicheng, Jiangnan, and were disturbed by the 共匪in the county. They fled to Shanghai from Guangdong because they have no relatives or friends here and it is difficult to make a living. They still have relatives in the provincial capital of Jiangxi who can be relied upon, but they have no travel expenses. Shi Yuemen, a standing committee member of the guild hall, consulted with Director Hu of the Jiangyu Steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, who agreed to transport them to Xunyang, turning to the province. By this, the refugees will be had a way to live. Mr. Huang Baoxiang, the director of the guild hall, sent Liu Huanran, the office manager, to escort the refugees on board at 5:00 PM on the 12th to arrange the refugees' meals along the way. The ship sailed early yesterday morning. The Jiangxi compatriots have repatriated refugees several times, and their enthusiasm for public welfare is evident.</p>

<p>Family Comes to Shanghai to Search for Him The kidnappers Zhou Xiaomazi and others, who kidnapped Zhou Zhiren and Wang Hanchen's son and daughter-in-law from Pingzhuangdian, Bacheng, Kunshan, have been hiding in Shanghai after kidnapping the victims. The Kunshan County Public Security Bureau sent detectives to Shanghai to arrest the kidnappers Zhou Xiaomazi and others, a total of eight people, and brought them back to Kunshan for trial, as reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that after the bandits were handed over to Kunshan, they were interrogated many times and confessed the location of the victims. The Kunshan County Public Security Bureau was about to prepare a document to send detectives to Shanghai to rescue them, but the three victims had already been released from the bandits' den. Wang Hanchen's son and daughter-in-law returned to Kunshan by car the other day. However, Zhou Zhiren was lost in Shanghai.

<h3 id="e156">After the Nitriding Fur Factory Was Destroyed, a Large Batch of Foreign Fur Was Suddenly Found Missing <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The China Nitriding Fur Factory at 2-4 Zhaofuli, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, was abandoned by its personnel during the January 28th Shanghai War. After the ceasefire, the manager returned to the factory to inspect, but found that the buildings had been reduced to ashes and rubble, a huge loss of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. They could only sigh in vain. Suddenly, on the 9th of this month, a young man with a generous appearance came to the Changtai Fur Shop at 225 Sichuan Road A, selling four boxes of foreign fur worth more than 700 yuan. He said that the goods were piled up in the Guangtailai Inn at 107 Aiduya Road. If anyone wanted to buy them, they could go to see them. The manager of the shop, Chen Shouzhi, went to see the samples and was very surprised because the goods were the stolen goods of the China Nitriding Fur Factory, as evidenced by the ADH three-letter code on the fur (Chen is also a shareholder of the China Nitriding Fur Factory). Chen immediately notified Jiang Baochu, the manager of the factory, to come to the scene to identify the goods, and then reported to the Dazimingzhong Patrol Room. Detectives Wang Rusong and Wang Maonan were dispatched to arrest Chen Yin, a Cantonese man who was harboring the stolen goods, and brought him to the patrol room. Yesterday, he was transferred to the Second Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. The lawyer of the patrol room, Yuan Jiaheng, stated the case, saying that the defendant had committed the crime of receiving stolen goods in Article 376 of the Criminal Law and requested that he be investigated according to law. Detective Wang Maonan said that he was ordered to investigate the other day and the owner of the inn stated that Chen Junda, a Cantonese man, came to Guangtailai Inn in April and rented Room 48. Four boxes of fur were transported from Wuxi, which was the stolen goods in the case and were piled up in the inn and could not be sold. Chen returned to Guangdong on May 17th and still owed the inn a large amount of room and board, stating that he would return to Shanghai soon and repay the debt after selling the goods. After Chen left, on July 13, Chen Yin, the defendant in the case, came to the inn with a letter from Chen Junda to Wang Jinbao, the manager of Guangtailai, saying that the goods were entrusted to Chen Yin to be sold in Shanghai, and Chen was also responsible for the outstanding room and board. As for where the goods came from, he did not know. The plaintiff Chen stated the situation of the theft. Chen Yin confessed that the fur was actually entrusted by his relative Chen Junda in Guangdong to be sold in Shanghai and he did not know its origin. Judge Wu Fanglian verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and ordered Chen Junda to be brought to court for questioning within seven days.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 13th), at approximately 8:00 AM, a Route 3 tram owned by the Chinese Tram Company, car number 46 driven by driver number 91, was traveling east to west when, as it passed the entrance to the Xiang Sheng Li alley west of Yingxun Road, a five-year-old girl named Xiuying, the daughter of Mei Yucheng who lived above the Pin Yun Laundry Company at 1057 Zhonghua Road, suddenly darted across the tram tracks while her mother, Mrs. Zhang, was out shopping. The driver was unable to brake in time and ran over the girl's head and feet. Instantly, blood flowed like a torrent, and she lost consciousness. Zhou Zhongxin, police officer number 22 stationed at Yingxun Road from the Second Precinct, Second District, apprehended the driver. The tram was then driven by Sun Duoyi, ticket inspector number 17, to Laoximen, where another driver took over. The injured girl was immediately transported by vehicle to the Xin Pu Yu Tang (New General Welfare Hall) on Puyu West Road for treatment, but tragically, her injuries were too severe, and she died upon arrival. The hall notified the local court by telephone to dispatch a prosecutor for an inquest. Her mother, Mrs. Zhang, then went to collect the body for burial. It was reported that after the driver was taken to the police station, he was interrogated by Chief Tang. The driver stated his name was Zhao Ziyuan, 31 years old, from Xuzhou, and described the circumstances of the accident, pleading for leniency. Chief Tang, believing the driver to be negligent and responsible for the death, prepared a written report and sent it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<p>Resulting in Dismissal and Detention for Interrogation. Lin Hua, a service member from the Inspection Department of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, a Cantonese, was introduced by a special letter from the Central Military Academy. After being on the job for over a month, his performance was mediocre. Unexpectedly, the Municipal Government recently received another official letter from the Central Military Academy recommending Lin Hua, stating that he was academically excellent, diligent, and capable, requesting that he be given a superior position. Mayor Wu approved the letter and forwarded it to the Public Security Bureau for selection of an optimal position, while also sending a reply to the Central Military Academy. However, the Municipal Government then received a reply from the Central Military Academy stating that the academy had not sent any special letter recommending Lin Hua and that it was likely a forged letter and requested an investigation. The Municipal Government secretly ordered the Public Security Bureau to thoroughly investigate. It was then discovered that both letters of introduction were forgeries. Yesterday, Director Wen and Chief Inspector Long dismissed and detained the service member Lin Hua and sent him to the Third Section for detention and interrogation.</p>

<p>The previous day, at 11:00 AM, Wei Baoyuan, manager of the Miaoxiang Studio in Huajin Lane, a native of Liuhe, arrived in Shanghai from Liuhe by the Shanghai-Taichang long-distance bus. He carried a small package containing two silk gauze long gowns, entrusted to him by Yu Yangran of Liuhe Park to be delivered to the Zonglan Company, along with a letter inside the clothing bag. After arriving in Shanghai, Wei hired a rickshaw to Xinzha Bridge, where he switched to another rickshaw to go to the concession. Unexpectedly, he left the small package on the rickshaw. When the rickshaw puller, identified as A, noticed it, he opened it and found two long gowns and a letter inside a bag. Knowing that it was to be delivered to the Zonglan Company, A took the small package to the company and was given one silver dollar as a reward. The rickshaw puller thanked them profusely and left.</p>

<p>The Details Are Very Complicated. Yesterday evening at approximately 7:00 PM, a French sailor with two gold stripes was walking along Huanlong Road when two Russian thugs suddenly jumped out from the roadside and stabbed the sailor with sharp knives. They then fled. A Chinese policeman who witnessed the incident hired a vehicle to take the injured French sailor to the police station.

<p>complicated. He was then sent to Guangci Hospital on Rue Kim Father for treatment. It was reported that the injuries were not life-threatening and he was not in danger of dying.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Kidnappers Trafficking Women into Prostitution <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Eight Male and Female Kidnappers Arrested Successively. Huang Fusen, a Chinese detective from the General Police Station, discovered that a large group of kidnappers were hiding in Room 9 of the Shanghai First Stage Hotel at 229 Henan Road, specializing in luring women into prostitution for profit. On the previous day, he, along with Chinese Detective Chief Tang Zihong and Detective Pang Ruiqing, secretly went to the location and arrested six kidnappers: Chen Yousheng, Shen A'er, Pan Guifu, Zhu Caibao, Jin Gensheng, and a woman named Zhou Chen. Subsequently, they arrested Shen A'wu and Zhu A'nan in Room 4 of the Huashang Hotel at 15 Beihai Road, and rescued a kidnapped girl named Zhu Yunge (15 years old) from Huzhou. They then continued to Zhendongjia Bridge, 34, in the French Concession and arrested Zhang Hengfa and Zhang Zhang. All were brought to the police station. Under investigation, it was learned that a woman named Zhou Azhen (17 years old) from Chang'an, Hangzhou, had been lured to Shanghai by Chen and others and held at the Hongxiang Courtyard No. 2 brothel on Dongxin Bridge Street in the French Concession and sold to the prostitute Gao Hongyu for 360 yuan. Zhou was then rescued. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to Criminal Division 1 of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted them for trafficking in persons. Because the police station had not yet fully investigated the matter, he requested an extension, which Judge Feng granted. He then ordered the defendants to be detained and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>Huang Biru Can't Bear the Harassment.</p>
<p>Luo Xingcha Imprisoned for Offenses. Huang Biru, a Cantonese residing in Hong Kong, possesses substantial wealth. Because he also has business in Shanghai, he often comes to the city. However, he has a fondness for male love. He was once introduced to Luo Xingcha, a young man from Suzhou residing at 1209 Dagu Road, for pederastic activities. From then on, whenever Huang came to Shanghai, he continued the relationship with Luo. Later, a male lover whom Luo kept suddenly disappeared, and he suspected Huang of enticing him away. Since then, animosity arose between them, and Huang ceased visiting Luo. On the 22nd of last month, Huang and Luo encountered each other on Xizang Road. Luo followed Huang all the way to the entrance of the Xinxin Hotel where Huang was staying. Fearing it would damage his reputation, Huang gave him six gold pieces to make him leave quickly. However, Luo's desires were insatiable, and he then barged into Huang's room, number 91, at the hotel, causing trouble. Huang, deeply unwilling to let the matter escalate, gave him another 20 yuan. Luo, realizing Huang was easily bullied, demanded another 40 yuan a few days ago. Huang, unable to bear the harassment, pretended to agree to a time to pay the money and reported the matter to the local police station. At the appointed time, the police chief dispatched Detective Tang Si and Detective Xu Zexin to wait in room 87 of the Xinxin Hotel. Soon after, Luo entered Huang's room, number 91, alone. Huang then paid him eight five-yuan banknotes from the Bank of China. As Luo left with the money, the detectives immediately arrested him and found the stolen goods. Yesterday, he was brought to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Qian determined that the charge of extortion was substantiated and sentenced Luo to a fine of 50 yuan, or imprisonment for one day for every two yuan if he could not pay the fine.</p>

<p>Zhou Yinhua's Fate Is Unfortunate.</p>
<p>Evil Men Cannot Escape the Law. Zhou A'lai, from Ningbo, works as a butcher's helper at Tao Xianggen's pig butchery in Taojiazhai, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei. He has a daughter named Yinhua, who is now 14 years old. When Yinhua was five years old, her mother passed away, so A'lai entrusted Yinhua to his sister, Mrs. Chen, at 27 Siwen Lane, Datong Road, where she was raised until now, for nine years. Unexpectedly, Mrs. Chen also passed away last year. Mrs. Chen's daughter, Chen Fuying, 22 years old, was a worker at a silk factory. Since her mother's death, she has been unable to support herself, so she also recommended Yinhua to work at the silk factory. On the 5th of this month, Zhang Yongxing, the owner of the clock shop at 606 Xinzha Road, and Ke Heshang, a member of the Xinzha District Fire Brigade number 81, came to Chen Fuying's place, claiming that Yinhua was growing up and that it was time for her to marry. They said that Ke's colleague, Zhou Hongyuan, a firefighter number 206, was single and of good standing, and they had come to act as matchmakers for Yinhua. However, they needed to take her to meet him first, and if they were compatible, they would notify them for the formal betrothal. Chen Fuying, along with Zhang and Ke, first took Zhou Yinhua to a teahouse and then to Zhou Hongyuan's house at 123 Guizhou Road. That evening, Zhou's cousin forcibly raped Yinhua. The next day, they colluded and sold Yinhua into a brothel in the French Concession for 300 yuan. Meanwhile, Zhang Yongxing, Ke Heshang, and Chen Fuying met with Zhou A'lai in Zhabei a few days ago, saying that they had arranged a marriage for Yinhua and received a bride price of 150 yuan. When Zhou asked where she had been betrothed, they refused to reveal it. The day before yesterday, Zhou A'lai, along with Tao Xianggen and others, went to Xinzha Road to argue with Zhang Yongxing, resulting in a quarrel. The police saw this and brought Zhang and others to the Xinzha Police Station. Under questioning, Zhang confessed to the previous events. Detective Cui Chengke was then dispatched to arrest Zhou Hongyuan, Chen Fuying, and Ke Heshang successively and detained them separately with Zhang Yongxing. However, after being sold into the brothel, Zhou Yinhua refused to receive guests and was abused by the madam. She secretly escaped the day before yesterday and went to Zhabei to look for them but could not find them. Returning to Chen Fuying's house in Siwen Lane, she was spotted by the patrol police, who brought her to the police station. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to Criminal Division 2 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang accused the four defendants of violating Article 25, Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law, for obstructing family integrity. However, because the victim, Zhou Yinhua, was raped, she needed to be sent to the hospital for examination. Therefore, he requested that she be temporarily detained at the Jiliang Institute and that because accomplices were still at large, he requested an extension. Subsequently, Zhou A'lai, along with Tao Xianggen and Tan Xueqing, surrendered themselves, explaining the previous events. The victim, Zhou Yinhua, testified that she was raped by Zhou Hongyuan's cousin and sold into a brothel in the French Concession, forced to receive guests, and that she escaped due to the beatings. She also identified Zhou Hongyuan's cousin, who was also present in court, overhearing the proceedings. The Chinese and Western detectives then apprehended Zhou's cousin and took him back to the police station for investigation in order to prosecute him. The defendants then hired lawyers Fan Gang and others to defend them, requesting bail. Judge Wu Tingqi questioned each defendant individually, and their responses were mostly evasive. He then ordered each defendant to be detained separately and rescheduled the hearing for seven days later. Zhou Yinhua was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for shelter.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Medicine Association held a meeting on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 8:00 PM. More than 20 people attended, including Xue Wenyuan, Jiang Wenfang, Sheng Xinru, and Shen Xinjiu. The following resolutions were passed: (1) A letter from the Central National Medicine Museum requesting proposals for reorganizing Chinese medicine and various effective prescriptions for adoption and implementation by the museum. Resolved: to be filed. (2) Yan Cangshan proposed that the Hygiene Department of the French Concession collect business tax from doctors. It was agreed that the person in charge of the French Municipal Council had previously promised the association representative that only one payment would be collected and not annually. Moreover, practicing medicine is not a business. It was resolved to reiterate to the French Municipal Council based on previous cases. (3) What should be done regarding doctors in the war zone who have lost their registration certificates from the Bureau of Hygiene and have not received a free replacement from the Municipal Government? Resolved: to appoint a representative to contact the Municipal Government in person, and Yang Yanhe was appointed as the representative. (4) The wood furniture of the Chinese medicine clinic in the refugee shelter for victims of flooding in various provinces, which was managed by the Social Bureau through the association, was destroyed in the war. The owner has repeatedly demanded compensation, and both the Flood Relief Association and the Social Bureau have instructed that it be registered with the Accountants Association as a disaster loss. However, the owner claims that this is a matter of great importance and requests a solution. Resolved: the association, for the sake of peace, will pay a discounted compensation. Other motions were also discussed, and the meeting adjourned at around 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Swindled When Exchanging Silver Dollars for Banknotes <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>For the Sake of Greed for Fifty Copper Coins.</p>
<p>Da Dexin Lost 45 Yuan. Yesterday afternoon, two young men in Western suits, with refined manners, suddenly arrived at Da Dexin Oil Shop on Muddy Beach Main Street in Pudong, holding fifty silver dollars wrapped in paper, and asked to exchange them for banknotes, willing to give one copper coin per dollar. The shop owner, thinking he could gain fifty copper coins, agreed. He opened the paper package, inspected the silver dollars, and found no counterfeits. After examining them, he placed them on the counter and took out the banknotes in the shop, but he only had forty yuan, which was not enough. Unexpectedly, the two young men suddenly claimed that the money was for paying wages and that if there were not enough banknotes, silver dimes could be substituted. The shop owner scrambled together silver dimes, but only managed to gather five yuan. Together with the banknotes, there were forty-five yuan, still five yuan short. He then took five silver dollars from the package brought by the two young men and went to the Yulong Money Exchange across the street to exchange them for banknotes. After finishing, he returned to the shop and handed over forty-five silver dollars and five silver dimes to the two young men. The two young men thanked him and left. The shop owner then recounted the silver package, only to find that upon opening the package, all forty-five of the snow-white silver dollars (because five yuan had already been exchanged at the money exchange across the street) had vanished. All that remained was an iron cylinder, about the size of a silver dollar and about five inches long. The cylinder was filled with lead, its weight approximately the same as fifty silver dollars. At this point, the shop owner realized he had been deceived. He rushed out to look for the two young men, but they had disappeared. The deceptive tactics in Shanghai are becoming increasingly strange. Businessmen must be extra vigilant.</p>

<p>Thieves Fired Shots as a Show of Force and Fled</p>
<p>An Apprentice Shot and Killed. At approximately 8:30 PM last night, while the Dachangxiang General Merchandise Store at 524 Yulin Road in Hongkou was preparing to close accounts, two burglars suddenly appeared, wearing blue and white short shirts and trousers. One burglar held a gun, guarding the entrance and monitoring the shop owner, forbidding him from making any noise. The other unarmed burglar entered the shop and attempted to rob the cash register. Jiang Zisheng, an apprentice at the store, happened to come out from the back and, seeing the situation, rushed forward to grab the cash register and shouted loudly. Seeing that things were not going well, the armed burglar fired a shot at the apprentice and fled. As he exited the door, he fired another shot into the air. Several off-duty police officers happened to be outside nearby, enjoying the cool air. They joined in the pursuit. Seeing this, the burglars fired another shot at the crowd and turned towards Yangzhou Road, escaping without a trace. The injured apprentice was shot in the right chest, a vital area. Due to excessive bleeding, he died before he could be treated. The Yulin Road Police Station sent a hearse to take the body to the mortuary for examination.</p>

<p>Male and Female Offenders Detained for Three Months Each.</p>
<p>Zheng Zulin, a Chinese detective from the Huishan Police Station, discovered that someone was privately operating a morphine injecting den at 183 Huaji Road, profiting from providing opium addicts with their fix. On the previous day, he secretly went with Chinese and Western police to arrest eleven people, including Zhang Jinshan, Li Yuanxiang, a woman named Ge Wu, and the suspect Chen Yuan, along with needles and other paraphernalia. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Summary Court of the First Special District. According to the police lawyer, the harm of morphine injection is more toxic than opium, and strict investigation should be requested. Detective Zheng then explained the situation, but the defendants' testimony was evasive. The court observed that the injection sites on the arms and legs of these people were purple, red, and swollen, like a honeycomb, which was shocking to see. Judge Wu Zhen sentenced Li Yuanxiang, Zhu Yushan, Qiu Zulian, Zhang Renzhi, Zhang Guoqing, and He Wentai to three months' imprisonment each, Zhang Jinshan, Zhao Xiaoyun, Zheng Pu, and the woman Ge Wu to two months' imprisonment each, and Chen Yuan was acquitted. The seized morphine and other items were confiscated.</p>

<p>Wang Yangchen Escorted to Suzhou for Interrogation. The Jin Feng Money Exchange in Tongli Town, Wujiang County, often had dealings with various money exchanges in Suzhou. The day before yesterday, Wang Yangchen, a cashier at Jin Feng, colluded with an internal accountant surnamed Li, wrote out several immediate checks, secretly stamped them with the money exchange's seal, and secretly went to Suzhou. They defrauded four money exchanges with whom they usually dealt, including Fengtai, Baoda, Fuda, and Jiuyuan, of 5,000 yuan each, totaling 20,000 yuan. They took the money and boarded the Shanghai-Nanjing night train to Shanghai. Fortunately, it was discovered that afternoon, and Pang Baisheng, the manager of the money exchange, rushed to Suzhou and boarded the special express train to Shanghai that day. He waited at the North Railway Station. At 5:00 AM the next morning, when the night express train arrived at the station, Wang and Li were seen getting off the train with leather briefcases. They were seized and turned over to the station police, who brought them to the police station. Wang Yangchen and others confessed to embezzling a large sum of money. The inspection of the briefcase revealed 19,700 yuan in cash, only 300 yuan short. They were escorted to Suzhou yesterday for interrogation.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Having read in your esteemed newspaper's local news column an article about a Yanghzou woman, Pei Yin, accusing Ms. Xu et al. of abducting her son, I was extremely astonished. Upon investigation, no court hearing or interrogation has taken place yesterday, so where did the quoted statement come from? It is apparent that the submitter fabricated the facts with ulterior motives. The content is completely inconsistent with the truth. As this concerns reputation, please correct it immediately. Enclosed is a letter from the Nanhui County Relief Center, which reads: "Received your letter stating that Ms. Xu Jiping has informed us that she dismissed her maid, Pei Yin, who then insisted that her son, Pei Sanzi, was placed in your orphanage at Ms. Jiping's suggestion, through the introduction of Pan Keping. The lawyer's letter is absurd and intended for extortion. We previously entrusted your law firm to sternly refute it. Now, Pei Yin has fabricated facts and falsely accused Ms. Jiping et al. of abduction to the Shanghai Second Special District Court. We have received a summons and specifically entrust your law firm to legally prosecute Pei Yin for false accusation, etc." We request that your institution provide detailed information on Pei Sanzi's admission and current situation to clarify the truth. According to our records, Pei Sanzi was admitted on March 26th, 1931. At that time, a man claiming to be Yin Qishan brought an orphan to the center, claiming the child was his nephew, named Pei Sanzi, whose parents were deceased and no one was able to care for him. He stated that he was going out to seek work and could not afford to take the child with him, requesting that we take care of the orphan. The center, seeing his pitiful situation, immediately ordered the orphanage to admit and educate him. Later, in November 1931, the director of the orphanage reported that citizen Zhang Huating had submitted a request to take back the orphan Pei Sanzi to raise him as his heir. With a guarantee from a public security officer and after verification, we approved the release in accordance with Article 8 of the orphanage's regulations. Pei Sanzi currently resides at 25 Bai Guo Shu, Hanximen, Nanjing, at Zhang Huating's home. The above is the content of the letter. Please investigate and inform us accordingly. This is a reply to Lawyer Hu Jue, from Nanhui County Relief Center, July 20th, 1932." We hope you will publish this together to clarify the truth and clear up any confusion. To the Editor of Shenbao, from Lawyer Hu Jue, August 13th.</p>

<p>Two One Branch Talk</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Tongue is Flat <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>All women who can speak have a dictionary of colloquialisms in their bellies. They quote them very aptly. Praising is done with a colloquialism, and condemning is also done with a colloquialism. As long as one remembers many colloquialisms, one can be eloquent.</p>
<p>When praising an ugly person, one says: "An ugly woman has the face of a lady." But if one despises ugliness, one simply says: "Ugly people are always acting strange." To say that all Bodhisattvas are the same, one simply says: "A thousand Buddhas, ten thousand Buddhas, are all one Buddha." To say that all Bodhisattvas are not the same, one simply quotes another saying, called: "Each temple has its own Bodhisattva."</p>
<p>To encourage people from the lower classes, one quotes: "A hero is not afraid of a humble origin." If one</p>
<p>detests people from the lower classes, one should say: "Good insects don't come out of thatched nests." To ridicule those who are stingy, one always says: "Ill-gotten wealth is like soup poured on snow." If one wants to defend them, one should say: "Righteousness does not manage wealth," which shows that the rich don't really need righteousness. To say that a person shouldn't be too kind, one can say: "Kind people are easily bullied, and good horses are easily ridden." To say that a person can be kind, one can also</p>
<p>say: "People fear the wicked, but Heaven doesn't; people bully the kind, but Heaven doesn't."</p>
<p>Why are there such different interpretations when quoting the same colloquialism? I have an analogy: it's like the oars on a boat. On a winding waterway, the oars can be used to row to this side and also to that side.</p>
<p>The oars of the boat are like a person's tongue: the oars are flat, and the tongue is also flat! To say good or bad, one only needs to use this three-inch red oar.</p>

<p>Fang Huan. Zi Weiyi. When his father, Yunting Gong, gave birth to Mr.</p>
<p>He was named Fang Zhong. He was given the surname Zhang. And he was nicknamed Huan. In middle age. He was very famous for his writing. In the two examinations of the Sui and Ke. The Xue Zheng arrived at the academy. He gathered the Xiu Shi from the nine counties of the Su area. He tested the ancient classics in one field. Mr.'s poems, lyrics, ancient Fu, were uniquely the best of the time. Almost no one in the entire area could compete with him. He went to the autumn examination many times. All were unsuccessful. In Ding You. He was selected for the first test. He entered the third test. He was plagued by dysentery. He was unable to complete the test. Therefore, he was dismissed. In Ding Wei. Mr. took office as the head of the land purchasing office for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, which was run by merchants. He changed his surname to Fang. He used the nickname Huan as his name. He then devoted himself to national affairs. He served as a member of the Provincial Assembly. He was also elected as a member of the Zizhengyuan (National Assembly). After the restoration of the Republic of China. He was appointed as the magistrate of Kunshan. He was courteous to the talented and humble. However, Zhao Kuo understood military affairs on paper. Chen Yu was a general. Yet he had not escaped his nature as a scholar. After acting as the magistrate for a year. He knew that he was not suited to be an official. He strongly recommended Song Chengjia of Yingzhou to be the magistrate. He retired bravely. It was rare and commendable. During the Qi-Lu War. The entire county was restless. Through Mr.'s best efforts to coordinate. It was safe after danger. The national army put down the rebellion. Nanjing was established as the capital. Mr. started again as the secretary of the Ministry of Communications. He retired due to old age. He lived in seclusion in his hometown. The Shanghai Incident suddenly broke out. Mr. discussed national affairs with Mr. Zhang Yifan, a gentry in Jiangsu. He went to Beijing to petition. He died of a minor illness. Alas. Tiger was born late. He met Mr. after the Wuxu year of the Guangxu reign. Mr.'s writing. He did not revise it. And his talent was overflowing. Like an angry horse going down a steep slope. His poetic talent was also like that. Z Jian's seven steps. Fei Qing's eight forks. It was enough to compare. Now Mr. is dead. Death is a common thing. It is a pity that the national studies are about to be extinct. And the spiritual light of the Lu Temple has been destroyed. The articles handed down to the world are unique and eternal. How can one not be sad. Mr. married Wang. He had two sons. Yue Heng Yue Jian. One daughter Yue Qing. She married Chen. Mr. was born on a certain day of a certain month in the Tongzhi reign. He died on a certain day of a certain month in the 21st year of the Republic of China. He lived to be sixty □ years old. According to Mr.'s deeds. There is not much to see. Here is a record of his major deeds. The eulogy says: One who worries about the world before the world worries. One who enjoys the world after the world enjoys. He can rule the world. What the people like, like it. What the people hate, hate it. What one desires to gather. What one hates, do not impose it. He can rule a city. He has neither virtue nor talent. He is only obsessed with fame and wealth. He perseveres. To be trapped in the inextricable. This is a sinner of the world. Mr. knew that being an official was impossible. He decided to give it up. To preserve his truth. He can also be immortal. (Returned Reward)</p>

I hope that the people of the country will rise up and promote it together. If there are large capitalists willing to invest in this business. Then its future. It must be even more promising. Now I will tell a story about undershirts. To end my article. Years ago. A tailor from Jiangyin. Knowing that there was no sale of this undershirt in the new capital. Therefore, I bought hundreds of pieces alone. Bundle it up and load it into Beijing. I hope to make a lot of profit. After entering Beijing, it rained for days. The undershirt was half soaked. Also, because Beijing did not know this thing. There were few buyers. And the capital was exhausted. Living in a hotel. There is no way to plan. Day. Passing through the market. It rained.

When they come, there are thousands of old women. In groups. Shouting and extortion. Even armed military police. There is no way to stop it. The suffering of the people.

<p>Master Hui Seng) Mr. Witnessing the calamity of his hometown. Great compassion. Jiu Mou Gentry and Merchants organized a Rice Borrowing Association for Poor Farmers. The wind of looting. Or it can be stopped by the old man's high call.</p>
<p>The Rice Borrowing Association is located in Jiaxing. The county magistrate is the backbone. Raise funds. Buy rice and lend it to the villagers. Its lending method. At most one Shi per person. There are written documents. Agreed to repay the autumn harvest. Mr. Chu is permanently stationed in Shanghai. Therefore, I am happy to be a purchasing committee member. I am happy to be in the Shanghai-Hangzhou road. I think I am doing rice buying for tens of thousands of starving disaster victims. This kind of beauty. Sincerely unparalleled glory. Yesterday, the Rice Borrowing Association had a huge sum of money remitted to the All Zhejiang Public Association. Entrust Mr. Chu to purchase 1,000 Shi of Xiao Jiao Rice to Yun He.

<h3 id="e189">An Island That Uses Stones Instead of Currency <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>Yap Island. Is one of the Caroline Islands located a few degrees north of the equator. After the European War. Entrusted by the League of Nations to Japan for trusteeship. The islanders are brave and fierce. Its tattooed body. Scars. It's scary to look at. The Caroline Islands. It is composed of coral fossils or basalt. And its 400 miles west. There is Barro Island. It is a volcanic fossil. In the past, someone drove a canoe to the island. Take the stone home. Everyone saw that its color was different from the ones produced on this island. I think it's strange. What era was this in? No way to test. The natives of Yap Island have always traded in goods. There are still many places that follow this custom. After the strange stone of Barro Island was transported here. Demand is increasing. This stone has no pleasing color. It cannot be used to make decorative utensils. I don't know why the islanders love</p>
<p>If so. Later, someone exchanged goods for stones. Over time. It has become a standard for transactions. And become a kind of currency. At first, the miners mostly belonged to crushed stones. Later, the more mining, the bigger it became. In recent years, the stones that have been transported here. Some are as big as millstones or wheels. And the thickness is different. So the more expensive its size and weight. It is possible to avoid the thief from running away with it. The stones are all chiseled into a flat shape. There is a hole in the middle. String with rough bamboo. Two people hold its ends. From the stone mine turntable to the beach. Shi Ju. The canoe cannot win. It is tied to a bamboo raft. Dragged for 400 miles. And to Yap. So it can be used for trade. The reason why the islanders use it as currency. Not because the stone is precious. Especially because it is not easy to mine and transport. Stone pickers often encounter wind boat capsizes. Or drowning in the turbulent waves. Or buried in the belly of the fish. Sometimes the bamboo raft sinks. Or because the stone is heavy and difficult to drag. Broken and discarded. It took months to leave home. Experienced all the hardships. Return empty-handed. Desperate. However, there are wise men. Think of a clever way. To comfort these people. If the stone picker can prove that he did go out by boat. Mining Barro. Transported to the beach. Lost in the middle. Then although the person did not bring the stone</p>
<p>Return. But everyone still thinks that he enjoys the lost stone. Like depositing money in a bank. The lost one. Only useless material things. And his hard work to get the stone. Still exists. Because the value of the stone. It also comes from hard work. Simply put. That is to recognize his wealth obtained through hard work and courage. And because of the catastrophe. Did not enjoy it. This recognition. Subject to the island chief. There is no written evidence. Only relying on oral transmission. Since generational succession. As if it were a real product. Anyone with a stone or the right to enjoy the lost stone. And you can transfer it. It also depends on the island chief to remember it in his mind. Recently, the Japanese once imported coins into Yap. Add</p>
<p>There are steamships traveling between Yap and Barro every month. It takes less than two days. Therefore, the currency problem of Yap. Therefore, it has changed. Although coins are convenient. The islanders are very reluctant to use them. Now except for dealings with the government. He followed the old habit of bartering. Although Barro has no stones transported to Yap. But the natives outside. There are still stones of various sizes from time to time. Leaning on the front side. And there are still stones as currency. The Japanese trusteeship government once implemented laws. All contracts. Must go to</p>
<p>Official registration. I heard that an island chief recently inherited the right to enjoy the lost stone through generations. Give it to his married daughter. I followed the law to register with the government for credit. Before long. The new couple used this fictitious stone to buy a coconut plantation. Re-register with the government for transfer. Islanders in small trade. Still use shells from the New Guinea Islands as currency. And have a fixed value. The shells are different from the stones. The color is lovely. And can be used to make decorations. The one who loses the shell. You can't enjoy the virtual right like losing the stone. It is also to avoid red tape.</p>

<p>It jumped up thirteen taels and three yesterday's bidding saw another rise, with no excessive fluctuations yet. In the morning and afternoon, there was a difference of six taels, but in the end, it surged by more than thirteen taels, and the sentiment turned positive. This was due to the rebound and subsequent fall in the silver market. Furthermore, the futures on the silver exchange continued to decline, and the exchange rate edged up by a fraction, which stimulated the gold market to reverse direction. It opened high early, and the buying sentiment was strong, mainly because the options were approaching, and the shorts were eager to cover. It had already rebounded past the 720 tael mark, and as the foreign exchange trend also strengthened, gold prices progressed easily. However, the upward trend could not be suppressed in the end, and it became even sharper, reaching 26 taels. The market will be closed on Saturday, according to regulations. Upon inspecting this week's situation, it has been chaotic and tumultuous. Initially, due to the reported decline in the silver market, it had reached 748.5 taels. Subsequently, silver prices and local drafts rose sharply, causing a slump. Amidst the rapid storm, it plummeted by 40 taels, with</p>
<p>Thursday suddenly at 709 taels (the next day, the gross price even broke through 700 taels (unexpected). Finally, the silver market rebounded, so it rebounded above 720 taels, with a shaky situation that was difficult to predict. The entire week saw a review of 39 taels and 5 cents, with a total continuation of about 17 taels. The details of yesterday's pre-market situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>The buying wind was at its peak in the morning. Since the early opening of the September contract at 720 taels, it rose by 7 taels and 7 cents. The big bar of silver fell back by 16 and 7 points, due to the decline in American silver by 1 point and 25, and the private telegram by 4 and 3 points (the gross price was over 21 and 2 taels). Ruixing, Yuankang, Xiangqian, Changxiang, Zhaofeng, Chang, etc. all entered, adding 1 tael and 78 cents, which was 21 taels</p>
<p>8 cents. After a while, Hengxing, Wanxing, Shunli, Yuhe, Yuanmao, Yong, etc. all came to sell, and the price depreciated by more than 2 taels. As for British gold, it seemed soft. The September contract settled at 193.125 to 375. Citibank had absorbed some. At 9 o'clock, it was 19 taels and 3 cents. Later, Zhongfu absorbed 31.25 US dollars for the November contract, and 30.0875 US dollars for the September contract. Then, Mitsui absorbed 25 in December, and then Zhifeng, Yongfu, Yuheng, Yuhengxing, Yuanda Kang, etc. competed to buy, and the price jumped by more than 5 taels. Among them, there were only a few cents of盘轉, and at 9:30 it was 24 and a half taels. The British gold list was as before. The US dollar was reduced by a fraction of the exchange rate by 125, but gold prices did not rise again. It was internal peace. Maixing produced 125 in November, and the US dollar produced 1 yuan in October, and then the Japanese people Dechengyuan, Yuanheng, Fuxing, Yongyi, Fengyong, Zhaofengchang, etc. all sold, and the price was about 2 taels. At 9:45 it was 22 taels. In a flash, there was an upward trend again, Xunyi Ruixing Hengchang Yonghong Kang Yongfuyu Tongfenghhengyi Fengyong Yongfeng, etc. competed to buy, and Zhaofengchang Fuxing Yongfu also dragged in again, which was to cover the shorts, and HSBC also paid 31.25 British gold in August, and US dollars in September only settled at 30.75, and the banks did each other 75 in August, but the price was more than 3 taels higher. At 10:20 it was 25 and a half taels. After that, the buying and selling was complicated, and people's hearts were uneasy, causing the price to rise and fall, between 4 and 5 taels, until after 11 o'clock, Andahua, Habi, Mitsui, etc. all came out of 30.09375 to 31 US dollars in September, and also the seller's activities, a total of Hengyu Zhifeng Yongda Decheng Fuyu Futaichengyuan Tai, etc. have been sold, and the price has fallen by 3 taels, and at 11:45 it was 21 taels and 8 cents. In a flash, the buying wind suddenly rose, because the short side suspected that the options were posted, because it was predicted by the peer that the long side still posted 5 taels, so they rushed to offset it, a total of Zhaofengchang Hengxingyuan Ruixing, etc. bought violently, and only increased by 4 taels in a quarter of an hour, until the closing at noon was 25 taels and 6 cents, and then raised to 26 taels, but Hengyu Bingxing Fuchang Yifengyong, etc. continued to drag in, which was 13 taels and 2 cents higher than the previous day (according to the list), which was a reaction after many days of falling. According to the largest half of the day was 25 taels and 6 cents, and the smallest was 15 taels and 3 cents, with a swing of 6 taels and 3 cents, and the red bar was 9 and a half taels.</p>
<p>The quotation is 10 taels less. The quotation was changed to 790 taels, because the US dollar was listed at 125, which was 678 taels, and the result was 64 taels, which was 10 taels less than the previous day. The registration supplement was also 26 taels.</p>
<p>Those who grabbed the air were very busy. The transactions on the structure were quite active, and the buyers seemed strong, mostly grabbing the air. According to statistics, Ruixing acted as a speculator for foreign merchants and Qiao Zhifu supplemented the air with about 890 bars. Zhaofengchang, Bingxing, Daxingyong, Zhifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Fuyu, Hongkangyong, Hengchangyong, Hengxingyuan, Yuankangxiang all entered, Yifengyong, Fuxingyong, Fuchang, etc. went out and then in, Yuanmaoyong, Yuandayong, Hengyu, Tongtaichang, etc. suddenly entered and exited, Yuanheng, Futaiheng, Dachengyuan, Yuantai, Yuhe, Shunli, Wanxing, Hengxing all went out, and the Dalian gang sold a total of seven or eight hundred bars of multi-bars on the same day, while entering one or two hundred bars, and the Guangdong gang sold six or seven hundred bars, The number of bars for each number was about 23,000 at the end of the previous day, and the short positions in all directions were more than 30% of the long positions.</p>

<p>A New York telegram report on the cotton market for the week states: The cotton market was extremely firm last week, with generally optimistic commercial activity. Government estimates of reduced production triggered active buying, and market prices have risen by US$11 per bale compared to the lowest point in mid-June. Current over-the-counter trading is active, with active short covering by industry participants and speculators. However, profit-taking by long positions and continued selling by cooperatives caused slight reactions. The official report was favorable to long positions, and unfavorable weather continued, strengthening the market further. According to a new report on flowers, the situation has deteriorated significantly since August 1, which the government report is based on. Some industry participants expect the report on Monday of last week to be the highest number for the season. Current conditions indicate that cotton harvests are less than world consumption by one million bales, suggesting that the carryover at the end of July next year will be significantly reduced. Weekend statistics for US cotton are below (in thousands of bales).</p>

<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Today is already the 14th of August. The notice from the Municipal Education Bureau about the start of the school term is not far off. Fathers and elder brothers must once again plan a sum for education expenses to send their children to school. Therefore, I will calculate the school fees and study time of children.</p>
<p>Let's not calculate elementary school. I will calculate middle school and university. For middle school, each semester's tuition, board, and lodging for one student costs at least eighty or ninety yuan, and as much as over one hundred yuan. In addition, there are expenses for books, pocket money, laundry, etc., requiring about one hundred and fifty-two yuan per semester. These students are not considered particularly extravagant. As for university students, naturally, it costs even more. Each semester requires no less than two hundred yuan. Therefore, for one student, three years of junior high and three years of senior high require one thousand eight hundred yuan to buy a middle school diploma. Adding four years of university requires another one thousand six hundred yuan to buy a university diploma. If the child is unwilling to study hard or is of dull aptitude, not counting any potential need for additional years, then one student requires three to four thousand yuan to graduate from middle school and university. With such aristocratic schools, how many people can afford to study?</p>
<p>Fathers and elder brothers spend such a large sum on education expenses, and then I calculate the students' study time. In one year, there is about one month for the New Year holiday, about one week or ten days for the spring break, and another two months or more for the summer vacation. Besides these, there are Sundays, various commemorative days, or sports meets, which also lead to holidays. Deducting these, one only truly studies for at most six months each year. Though nominally ten years are spent in middle school and university, in reality, one only truly studies for five years. This also doesn't account for truly unprofessional schools. If one unfortunately encounters patriotic movements or school disturbances, such temporary wastage of studies is not even included in the calculation.</p>
<p>Therefore, for a student to graduate from a domestic university, including six years of elementary school fees, requires four thousand yuan. Studying abroad is out of the question. Assuming you have three children, you need no less than twelve thousand yuan for education expenses. Assuming you have four children, you need no less than sixteen thousand yuan for education expenses. I ask, with such costs, can fathers and elder brothers still bear it?</p>
<p>Because the school fees are so large, and the profit margins so high, unprofessional schools have sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain. Principals only know how to collect money and don't care about the students' studies. Every extra day of holiday means an extra meal for them. Teachers, fearing the instability of their jobs, merely go through the motions with the students and dare not be too strict. Therefore, although they are nominally university graduates, some cannot write proper Chinese, and some cannot write a simple English letter. I ask, how can such education not lead to bankruptcy?</p>
<p>People go bankrupt because of their children's education, and schools go bankrupt because of educational corruption. Especially, politicians often use the blind minds of young people as tools for contention and infighting. Therefore, school disturbances become more and more frequent. Fathers and elder brothers spend vast amounts of money, but students are unwilling to focus on their studies, instead waving flags and shouting slogans, engaging in meaningless activism. Alas, with such human hearts, what else can be said? With China like this, what cure is there? I can only be like reading Councilor Chen's speech, with the final sentence marking the end.</p>

<p>— Right Year</p>
<p>In the winter of Xinwei, I visited General Dai in Suzhou. The General had just returned from suppressing bandits in southern Jiangxi. Such rivers and mountains, such a scene! Gusu (Suzhou) has been home to beautiful jade since ancient times. Returning now from suppressing bandits in Hongdu (Nanchang), he carries back a body stained with blood.</p>
<p>Inscribed on the wall of the General's quarters in Longhua:</p>
<p>The iron cavalry descended upon Shanghai, military headquarters opened in Longhua. Old friends appreciate lodging here. In the new spring, we watch the raising of banners. Silver seals follow commands, red brushes shame flowery words. Morning and evening we hear the drums of war. Living here deeply, we forget our homes.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Various Printing Methods <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Fumin</p>
<p>(1) Postcard Printing Method: There are many postcard printing methods. The simplest is to use lamp-light paper to make postcards. I often imitate this method and have found it quite effective. This type of postcard paper cannot be exposed to light, so it should be wrapped in black paper for normal use. When needed, choose a spot near a kerosene lamp, about four or five feet away, where there is no direct strong light. Unfold the paper package, place the negative on top, and place a large wooden board underneath. Use four bamboo strips to clamp the two sides (or a photo frame can also be used). Place it at an angle, five or six inches from the lamp, allowing it to receive light for about one minute. Then, release the bamboo strips and take out the paper. At this time, there is no image on the paper. It must be immersed in developing solution for several hours before an image appears. After developing, wash it with clean water and immerse it in a sodium sulfite solution (one part sodium sulfite to ten parts water) for about ten minutes. Take it out, wait for it to dry, and then re-wet it. Finally, paste it onto a clean glass slide and dry it slowly.</p>
<p>After drying, it can be peeled off, and a photographic postcard is complete.</p>
<p>(2) Teapot Printing Method: Use a bristle brush to remove stains from the surface of a teapot. Slowly coat it with animal glue (glue made by boiling animal skin and bones) in an oval shape. After it dries, add a layer of silver nitrate solution (one part nitric acid to nine parts water). Place the negative on the coated surface, tie it tightly with string, and place it horizontally in the sunlight for one minute until the image appears. Then, remove the negative and use a bristle brush dipped in plenty of clean water to wash the surface of the teapot. When a white mist appears, wash it away with water. Moisten it with borax water and gold chloride solution, then the image will appear reddish-brown. When it turns purple, wash it again with water, and the image will be fixed on the surface. Allow it to dry slowly. This method can be used for printing images on porcelain items such as bowls and basins. However, if the surface of the porcelain is round or uneven, it will be difficult to apply the negative closely to the surface, making it difficult to develop a clear image.</p>
<p>(3) Handkerchief Printing Method: Soak the handkerchief (any kind of handkerchief except towels) in soapy water to wash away grease. After it dries, use a brush to apply silver nitrate solution to its surface. There is no fixed method; you can make a circle, oval, square, polygon, or apply it in a corner or in the center, all are acceptable. However, the amount applied should be even, not biased. After application, place it in a dark place to dry in the shade. When printing, take a piece of black, firm paper, cut out square or round holes in the middle, and place it between the negative and the handkerchief. Place them together in a printing frame and expose them to the sun. When the image is deep enough, take out the handkerchief and process it according to the teapot printing method. However, all washing and other processes should be done by immersing it in the solution.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Abolishing Smoking, Drinking, and Gambling as Social Customs <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>Relationships arise between people, and customs are passed down. Whenever there are weddings, funerals, or other celebratory events, it is customary to exchange gifts and socialize. Therefore, the host family must prepare cigarettes and alcohol to entertain guests, and mahjong, the most popular form of gambling, is an indispensable item in social gatherings. There are already proposals from comrades in this association to improve social customs, and the elimination of bad habits such as smoking, drinking, and gambling is all the more urgent.</p>
<p>The harms are briefly described below.</p>
<p>(1) Smoking: In ordinary interactions between friends, offering a cigarette is very common. It can be said that everyone in the country can puff on one. However, cigarettes contain nicotine, which is not only irritating but also easily damages the lungs. Although you don't feel anything while smoking, it is very harmful in the long run. In social gatherings, people even prepare opium. In the host's mind, it's just for fun, but the harm of smoking opium is of course known to everyone and is also illegal (before the formal opium monopoly, I could still say this).</p>
<p>(2) Drinking: Like cigarettes, a few friends can meet and get drunk at Gao Changxing's or Ma Shanghou's place. When a family has an event, they will force guests to drink another cup. The harm is as described above. Currently, many movies even teach spoiled sons how to violate the chastity of women, such as Li Baozhen in "Married Woman" and Luo Xia in "Fallen Hate." Movies have performances by big stars, so naturally such things happen in society as well.</p>
<p>(3) Gambling: I am particularly referring to mahjong. Mahjong is a national treasure of China, and it is now fashionable in Europe and America, where people think that being able to play mahjong is fashionable. Families with children instill in them a desire for luck, deeply imprinting the idea of gambling in their young minds. Women are even more enthusiastic about it, destroying family happiness and leading to bankruptcy, which is also expected.</p>
<p>Therefore, members of this association specifically propose this for discussion and guidance.</p>
<h3 id="e213">The Question of Gender Equality <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Has the issue of gender equality already been resolved? Otherwise, why haven't we seen any discussions about it for so long? The reason why I bring up this issue for everyone to discuss is that I believe the issue of gender equality is still an open question that has not been resolved. If you don't believe me, please look at the following facts:</p>
<p>First, let's talk about old-style women. The so-called old-style women refer to those women who have not studied Western knowledge, learned modern ways, and still believe in the three obediences and four virtues. They still hold the old concepts of obeying their fathers at home, obeying their husbands after marriage, and obeying their sons after their husbands die, living a muddled life. They are truly like the ancients said, "not knowing there was Han, let alone Wei and Jin." Everything depends on men, so naturally, there is no gender equality to speak of.</p>
<p>It is a fact that old-style women are still slaves of men, and there is no need to deny it. Let's look at how new-style women are. The so-called new-style women, of course, refer to those women who have studied Western knowledge, are good at modern ways, and extremely believe in the liberation of women (?). They have studied Western knowledge and can write some mushy letters like "Dearest Brother," "My Most Beloved," "My...," and can say some seductive words like "My dear, I love you," "Kiss me..." They live a life of drunken stupor every day. Clothing, food, housing, and everything they use are provided by men. It is still a life of dependence. The only difference from old-style women is that old-style women have to manage household affairs and don't know how to have fun, while new-style women can ignore household affairs and enjoy themselves to the fullest. The former can be said to be the slaves of men, and the latter can be said to be the toys of men. In short, they are not people, not people who are equal to men.</p>
<p>There is another type of new-style women, which can be said to be a separate faction of new-style women. Of course, this faction of women has also studied Western knowledge, is not very modern, and knows that to be equal to men, they must seek economic independence. Therefore, they also serve in society and have considerable professions. This faction of women's thinking is extremely new. If there is no production, it is inevitable to become a slave of men, and modernization becomes a toy of men. But the money they earn is their own, and the burden of the family is still pushed onto the men. Occasionally, when the husband's income is not enough, or when he is unemployed, and needs the woman's help a little, then these women consider it a favor to the men, not an obligation that should be fulfilled. It is difficult to be seen without modern clothes, and modernization becomes a toy of men. So they come up with a compromise. Only new-style women who have studied Western knowledge can come up with this: they also make one or two modern clothes, specifically for going out to let the people on the street to see, while at home they wear ragged clothes and unkempt hair, leaving it for the husband to see.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, think about the issue of gender equality. How should it be resolved in the end? Or should we just leave it like this?</p>
<p>Truly!</p>
<h3 id="e214">Love and Money <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Yinong</p>
<p>I remember a summer day last year, in the sweltering heat. I took some time out of my busy schedule to visit an old classmate, Mr. A, who lived in a garret in a small alley in the French Concession. Mr. A, my old classmate, was my most respected and feared beneficial friend. He carried the full range of abilities and was full of determination. He had mixed in the dirty political arena for several years. His performance was very good! He gained both fame and fortune. He and his "she"—two little girls—lived a sweet life. Husband sang, wife followed, a happy and harmonious family. It was indeed worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>The tide of economic downturn spread to the unfortunate Mr. A. Salary arrears, pay cuts, layoffs, and ultimately unemployment. Their family's life gradually contracted. When it was tightened as much as possible and shrunk as much as possible, problems ultimately arose.</p>
<p>As a result of tightening, they no longer lived in a single-family small Western-style house and went to live in that steamer-like garret. They could not eat fully nourishing food, could not wear suitable clothes, and had no share in entertainment that could nourish their body and mind. It was indeed difficult for them to survive in such a bad environment. When I walked into Mr. A's bedroom, I saw that Mr. A was still lying on a small wooden bed in this hot weather. His pale face and short breath indicated that he was ill. His wife, Ms. T, was well-educated and had a thorough outlook on life. She had gone through a love process and held a grand wedding. In the three years of love crystallization, they already had two little girls. Now, she was knitting her eyebrows and sitting on a half-old cloth couch, coaxing the two little children. When Mr. A saw me walking into his bedroom, he hurriedly called me to sit by his bed, and in a trembling voice, said to me:</p>
<p>"Yi! Marriage is the tomb of love! This sentence is absolutely correct. Before we got married, how sweet it was. The foundation of our union was built on spirit, not on material things. Who knew that today, the spirit is still this spirit, but the material things are very different. That is, our love is about to change. I, who am added with disease and poverty, must not strive from the material perspective, I am afraid that I will not be able to maintain this kind of love. The ancients said that love between husband and wife is called the joy of fish and water. I say that love is fish, and money is water. Fish cannot survive without water. Without the help of money, I am afraid that love will be difficult to last?"</p>
<p>After listening to his words, I told him not to be too sentimental and think too much. It was most important to be at ease and rest quietly. I also advised Ms. T not to have a rift because of these indignant words of the patient. It is necessary to understand each other. Although Ms. T did not say anything, according to what I knew, she did say a lot of complaints because of this environment, such as "Without me, you wouldn't have suffered this kind of family burden, I am hurting you." Mr. A, of course, could not be completely without feeling when he heard these words.</p>
<p>The night before, I was walking alone along the smooth Yuyuan Road. A refined red building reflected green lights. As the iron gate opened, a couple walked out very smartly. Taking a closer look, this was my old classmate Mr. A, accompanied by his she Ms. T.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>When they saw me, they called me to their home and chatted in a small living room. I then learned that Mr. A had obtained a suitable position after his illness last year and had restored his old life. However, Mr. A always maintained his prejudice,</p>
<p>Love is fish, money is water, water can feed fish, fish cannot leave water!</p>
<h3 id="e215">Initial Diagnosis — Yiping <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Venereal diseases are increasing rapidly in Shanghai. A certain doctor, skilled in speculative management, actually became a wealthy man. So, near the French Concession, he rented two houses, one as a hospital and one as a pharmacy, both inscribed with his own name. He also widely installed X-ray lamps, sun lamps, etc., and many people promoted him. Business was booming. Because of his publicity, I also visited for the first time. In a corner of the waiting room, there was a registration desk. (Registration fee two yuan.) That black-robed figure, like an informant, said to me. I paid two dollars. "Initial visit or follow-up visit?" He probably influenced by the master (please see the following). He asked me in a commanding tone: "Initial visit," I said. He gave me an initial visit token and a copper plate with number forty-eight. At this time, there were more than a dozen patients waiting in the waiting room, treated according to their number. Now only number thirty-two was reached. Helpless, I took a walk nearby, waiting and waiting. Two hours later, it was number forty-eight's turn. I stepped into the examination room. It was a wing room equipped with advanced medical equipment. The nurse took the copper plate and asked me to sit on a white painted stool next to Dr. So-and-so. He began to ask me: "What's wrong?" "Lung disease." "Seen a doctor in the countryside?" "Taken any medicine?" Asking here, he filled in something on a printed paper.</p>
<p>"Had injections?" "What kind of liquid?" He continued to write, without even looking at me. "XXXX (a kind of lung disease liquid)." "Hmm." (Seemed suspicious.) "Have chills and fever?" "No." "Cough?" "In the morning." "Have phlegm?" "Yes." "Have blood?" "No." Then he ordered something, and the nurse put a thermometer in my mouth. He continued to write. Three minutes later, the nurse reported: "37.3 degrees." "Have chills and fever!" He seemed to be talking to himself, while at the same time accusing me of lying.</p>
<p>Then he just examined my chest, listened roughly, tapped with his fingers once. "Lung breathing power too weak, first reduce chills and fever first."</p>
<p>He filled in a printed paper again. "Is it lung disease?" I asked in doubt. "Yes."</p>
<p>"What stage?"</p>
<p>"Hmm... hmm... approximately (note, doctors can use 'approximately' tone) the second stage." "Where is it bad?"</p>
<p>"The apex of the lung." "Is the lower part intact?" "Approximately (note again) intact." "What happens after taking the medicine for reducing chills and fever?" "First take an X-ray."</p>
<p>I wanted to ask again, but the nurse shouted for number forty-nine to come in for interrogation. I was forced into the pharmacy next door and bought the medicine. They didn't give me the prescription.</p>
<p>"Where's the prescription?" "It's kept here, ready for follow-up visits for comparison."</p>
<p>From the above, one can imagine how terrible it is to see a doctor in Shanghai. The diagnosis is all obtained in an interrogation,</p>
<p>and still cannot determine what disease this is. There is no prescription, and the patient cannot negotiate after taking the wrong medicine. So my initial visit is finally an initial visit, approximately (no need to pay attention), he is still waiting for me to take an X-ray.</p>

In the past, state and county officials would accept cases based on verbal accusations. Recently, however, it has been observed that courts often require written statements even for simple cases, causing inconvenience to the parties involved and failing to adhere to the provisions of the law. In order to seek truth from facts, the Ministry of Justice, for the sake of promoting industry, orders that all courts must transcribe and print multiple copies of the various items listed in Article 393 of the Civil Procedure Law, which allow for oral prosecution. These copies must be posted on the doors of the courts and published in local newspapers so that the public is aware of them. Hereafter, minor lawsuits, whether for prosecution, declaration, or statement, may be made orally and need not be limited to written form, thereby complying with the wishes of the people and upholding the law. It is ordered that the court comply with this order and instruct its subordinates to comply and handle accordingly. Therefore, this proclamation is issued, along with a full transcript of Article 393 of the Civil Procedure Law, so that all litigants are fully informed. This proclamation is hereby issued. Attached is the text of Article 393. Article 393 Regarding lawsuits involving property rights, the simple procedures specified in this chapter shall apply to cases where the amount or value of the subject matter is less than 800 yuan. The following types of lawsuits, even if the amount or value of the subject matter exceeds 800 yuan, shall also be subject to the simple procedures: 1. Lawsuits involving landlords or tenants regarding the receipt of houses or the relocation of use, repairs, or the withholding of tenants' furniture and goods. 2. Lawsuits between employers and employees arising from employment contracts with employment periods of one year or less. 3. Lawsuits between travelers and innkeepers, restaurant owners, or transporters regarding food, lodging, transportation fees, or the safekeeping of luggage and property. 4. Lawsuits arising from requests for protection of possession. 5. Lawsuits arising from the determination of boundary lines or the establishment of landmarks on real estate. 6. Other lawsuits where the parties agree to apply the simple procedures. August 13, 21st year of the Republic of China. Court President Shen Jianqing. (The above was issued on June 13th)</p>
