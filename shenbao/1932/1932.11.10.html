<h3>今日本報要目</h3>
<p>國内劉湘軍進攻内江瀘州中政會通過收歸招商局案日軍派飛機轟炸訥河縣城</p>
<p>國外羅斯福當選美國大總統日本擴張軍備日俄談判成僵局</p>
<p>上海公安局昨開冬防會議謀害政界之要犯三十三名移解公安局發封北新書局命令到滬</p>
<p>時評</p>
<h3>美總統選舉揭曉又玄</h3>
<p>美國三個月以來之選舉白熱競爭今日以後即正式告一段落明年三月後之白宮主人將非五十九歲之胡佛而爲五十歲之羅斯福矣</p>
<p>共和黨自一九二一年哈定接任迄於現在穏執政權十二年之久雖其間曾三易其人而傳統政策未嘗稍有變更且承世界大戰之蔭以爲北美合衆國之繁榮將繼續萬年永保其絕對的勝利也乃一九二九年秋間股票風潮陡起所謂胡佛市面者遂一跌而不可收拾雖去年迄今曾用種種刺激方法煽動市面之好轉但一無實效尤以本年七月而後盡力鼓動股票漲價其間雖曾上漲若干點但未嘗及於一九二九年之繁榮狀態於是益知共和黨之不能把握人心固已昭然</p>
<p>現在民主黨候選總統羅斯福旣已當選其所揭示之政綱今後將見諸實施除解放禁酒令能於短時期内實行之外其他對内經濟政策恐亦不免於感覺棘手</p>
<p>第一美國受經濟恐慌影響十分深刻其失業羣究有多少官方雖無正確統計但據各專門估計至少當在一千一百萬人以上此實爲美國當前最大之困難亦爲資本主義諸國共有之危機羅斯福氏競選之時曾允許給予失業者以上工作然而美國一般工業决難因羅斯福氏之當選而遂驟興則其就任總統之後何從有業以給無工可作之人矧世界經濟之轉機目前并未見眞正好轉羅斯福氏個人亦未必能隻手回天也</p>
<p>第二爲歐美之間糾紛已久附帶於對德賠償問題之戰債歐洲諸國欠美債本利和合計約有二百二十億美金圓共和黨對此問題原取拖延主義態度　昧蓋恐過於明顯無論爲取消爲索取均將惹起國内外之巨大風波而民主黨對此則高唱反對「取消戰債」縱使博得國内資本家之同情亦或能刺激公債股票市塲之興奮然對世界經濟恐慌之救濟問題歐洲諸國之經濟危機與夫「現金偏在」等等綜錯交織之複雜關係即令美國决不承認取消戰債其如債務國無力償還何</p>
<p>第三關稅問題在民主黨政綱『乃以財政收入爲競爭關稅之目的不受行政部之干涉新設事實調查委員會與各國間締結互惠關稅協定促成世界經濟會議以使貿易增進以使匯兌交易簡易化』羅斯福氏競選之際亦曾盡量攻擊共和黨之保護關稅政策然民主黨就歷史上就現實情况言之均非自由貿易主義而爲相當的保護主義者與共和黨之間僅只程度上之差别矧合衆國東部西部中部南部北部其産業的經濟的利益觀點各自不同頗難求得一致之點故民主黨雖高唱互惠協定之論其實行力何如不無疑問且英帝國經濟會議而後英帝國内之經濟聯盟似已漸次形成在此時間豈肯輕於與他國訂定犧牲自國之互惠關稅協定耶羅斯福氏對此尤不能無所顧慮也</p>
<p>第四外交問題在此次美國競爭選舉中未嘗占特殊地位意即兩黨之間對外政策并無大不同之點其外交主眼端在遠東問題無論共和黨民主黨對華政策及對太平洋爭覇之態度皆甚相似且皆主張維護華盛頓九國公約及非戰條約對中國領土之保全門户開放機會均等無不持同一態度且於日本之侵略東三省亦仍抱定「不承認主義」民主黨對此并無二致</p>
<p>吾人回憶一九一五年日本强迫我中國承認二十一條件之際當時美國總統爲威爾遜氏彼固民主黨也其國務長官樸納安氏五月十三日致日本公文中有「美國及在華美國人民之條約權爲對於中國之領土的政治的保全以及普通之門户開放如中日之間締結任何有害於國際政策之協定美國皆不能承認」此種「不承認主義」自威爾遜以至於胡佛均未嘗變更羅斯福氏出身於民主黨雖其對内政策及對歐洲戰債關係與共和黨之間有若干差異其於遠東政策之傳統在勢在理均難變更且亦不能變更也不過或將更易史汀生氏之口頭抗議而爲實際的準備亦未可知耳蓋羅斯福氏近年雖從事於和平運動不似海軍次長時代之飛掦猛躍而其爲實際政治家則一也雖民主黨主張菲利濱獨立但并未允許放棄對菲之軍備特權其於西太平洋上仍得建立强有力之海軍艦隊也故明年三月而後之白宮主人於對美國人民給予痛飮一盃之外其他則尙待努力吾人於美國此次新總統之當選敬致其誠懇之祝意</p>

<h3>羅氏政策一斑</h3>
<p>路透社九日紐約電羅斯福當選其影響及於世界者未必顯著美國稅則今後不致大減且兩黨皆反對取銷戰債僅願整理之以換取債務國對美出口貨物之便利衆料羅斯福特繼續胡佛政策對於國聯予以有限制之合作如軍縮弭戰及恢復世界經濟是以酒禁言羅斯福可以阻止酒禁法之修正而對於失業省及其救濟請願或將予以更大之同情</p>

<h3>昨日足球賽東華勝英海軍</h3>
<p>結果七與一之比</p>
<p>東華足球隊昨以七比一擊敗英海軍於棒球場此爲友誼比賽茲記其經過如下</p>
<p>康惠爾實力平平昨日之賽東華原約海陸軍混合隊比賽但以時間匆促不及接洽乃由海軍中之康惠爾隊出場該隊實力平平不堪東華勁軍一擊故成一面倒之形勢頗少精彩之處</p>
<p>李義臣打開紀錄三時開賽海軍開球一鼓作氣直搗東華腹地環攻多時陸鍾恩化險爲夷萬象華左面進攻中路缺少應援徒勞拔踄旋見陳家球帶球連破兩關傳送門前守門跑出救球李義臣先發制人球攻守門身上彈回馮運佑還至門前時守門尙未及返義臣向空門掃射一舉成功打開紀錄</p>
<p>家球義臣又連中中央開球往返不三分鐘屠開元自左邊界擲球陳洪光撥過左方萬象華奔前傳中正對球門守門接而失落時家球横裹衝上門將心慌罔知所措乃被家球踼入網窩往後李義臣得洪光之傳遞又攻入一球向左門角而進成三與零之比</p>
<p>上半時成四對一英軍連失三球誓志反攻由左路進兵派遜斯孤軍深入吳幼良返身不及尹政達堵禦不週派遜斯登堂入室急射一球平地滾去東華守門阿陸不能仆地球乃穿入網底不旋踵英軍門將包德爾又告失手陳洪光趕上馬到成功上半時遂成四比一</p>
<p>陳家球連中兩球棒檬過後易門再戰英軍士氣益見衰落幾度往返角　良久陳家球身先士卒連中兩球而成六一之比</p>
<p>李義臣頭上功夫戰至此英軍守門受傷由右内衛暫代撲救功夫反較前者爲佳救出險球不少最後由李義臣用頭頂入一球遂成七比一之結局裁判員李思廉</p>

<h3>「眞不二價」</h3>
<p>— 碧</p>
<p>｜商業交通化｜</p>
<p>「蘇州人討價，一半價，」這是上海人形容商店定價不劃一主顧可隨意還價的一句俗語。其實蘇州人的一半價，倒還有個標準，譬如討價二大元，還價一元就得了，偏嘲笑蘇州人一半價的上海人，討起價來，時常要討到一倍以上，「望天討價，就地還錢，」那眞是荒天下之大唐。</p>
<p>但是上海人的望天討價，同蘇州人的一半價，「工」雖一樣，「曲」却各異。同是一元的貨品，蘇州人討價是二元，於是主顧還價一元，就成交了。上海人呢，又是一樣方法。一元的東西，在「眞不二價」的金字招牌之下，標着原價十元，在大玻璃窗上貼着一不顧血本」，「大犧牲」，「照原價打倒九折」的紅綠紙條，於是主顧也可只花一元而成交。</p>
<p>「入國問禁」，各地有各地的習慣，我因此有了一些感想，覺得「商業道德」，有亟須提倡的必要，否則將無往而不吃虧。所以我現在希望「商業交通化」。怎麽呌做商業交通化？哪，譬如我們要搭火車，寄信，拍電報，定價若干，劃一不二，缺一個大，坐在櫃台裏的先生，隨你稱他老爺，鐵面無情，莫想通融得過。不拘你是一位當方土地，或是來路土老兒，倒是同等待遇的。所以我希望商店的討價，同交通機關一樣的「眞不二價。」</p>
<p>還有現在上海的大學和中學，收學費部托銀行代收，由銀行發給收據，作爲上課的執照，於是富學生，窮學生，老少無欺，一律平等學費交足，不成問題，無力交足，還價免開尊口。這種精神上的劃一不二，不論中外大小商人，槪當效法，倘使實行商業敎育化，倒也行。</p>
<h3>影展</h3>
<p>— 定</p>
<p>｜幾幀女性人像的新作｜</p>
<p>甲｜伊的頸子上面，好似安放着一個沙田杣，向前的鼻子凹裏撒着幾顆好似細紗似的東西，一直蔓延到兩旁的巴掌上去了。</p>
<p>乙｜山東雅梨的顔色,黃嫩得多麽可愛··但是伊的臉龐兒，十足地形似一個倒置的山東雅梨。在伊的臉龐兒上的黃色，就覺得可怕，雖然也有硬性粉和軟質膏的搽抺。還有雅梨上黃褐色的細點，也可以在伊的黃臉上找尋出來。</p>
<p>丙｜從前在一位朋友家裏看見過一隻德國種的佳犬，它一頭很長的黑毛，披拂在白毛的面部··兩隻黑而有光的瞳子，常常射出帶着和悅的神氣，我覺得很是愛它。現在遇到了伊，使我把德國種佳犬的神態重温起來··因爲伊也長着一頭黑髪，而且很長，罩在伊用物質造白的臉子上。但是伊的黑色雙瞳，却没有它那般和悅。</p>
<p>丁｜對等的三角形，就是伊臉腔的輪廓。最顯著的是伊的一對剃掉而畫就的長眉··前面的眉頭，差不多要接住，旁邊的眉梢，差不多要篐轉去了。你假使遠遠地向伊一望，好似戴着一個細細的髪圈。</p>
<p>戊｜伊的同伴，大家呌伊是··「雙鈴鬧鐘」。伊的兩隻眼睛，半開半閉的好似那蓋在鬧鐘上面半圓形的雙鈴··伊的臉兒，又是圓圓的··而且伊講談的話聲，也竟像雙鈴齊鳴一般的響亮。</p>
<p>己｜在伊的幼年，左頰上生了一個減低姿色的大瘡，所以成了高低不平的肉疣，很像一個洗淨白皮圓形的山芋。不過伊的一雙眸子，依舊有攝人的權威，假如你從右半邊看過去時。</p>
<h3>站在電車頭上兜風</h3>
<p>— 程魯丁</p>
<p>｜胡思亂想｜</p>
<p>今天，站在電車頭上兜風！我設想，假如我是一個大偉人，假如我是一個資本家，假如這時候，原來是夏天，那末，我就幸福了！</p>
<p>然而，畢究這是深秋了，吹到我面上的，是冷風，雖則是秋風，我也仍舊站在電車頭上來兜風。</p>
<p>站在電車頭上兜風，雖說並不漂亮，在一般人的眼目中，也似乎這是滑稽的事，但究其實，這是難能的，這是可能的，至少，該是一個别開生面的兜風吧？</p>
<p>汽車裏的兜風，我不知道，但是否有這樣的快樂，還是一個問題，但究竟，是否有這樣的滋味賜給我？是否有這樣的風景陪伴我？也是一個問題。</p>
<p>寒風吹遍了我的四肢，冷風接觸了我的五官，不消說，這兜風的好處，决不止此，就是這樣吧，也要引起了許多人的飄飄然了，又至於兜風的舉動成爲有錢人的專利品。</p>
<p>然而當着刺骨的秋風，接吻我的面龐時，這正是電車頭上兜風的得意處，却也像一個摩登女郎接吻一樣的幸福，縱然是，斑斑的灰塵，片片的污點，在我面龐上印成了一個幸福的烙印，這與搽點雪花膏，又有什麽區别呢？</p>
<p>如果是前面一輛亮晶晶的汽車，風馳電掣地飛過去，背後就有一片泥沙黑烟飛過來，如果我是餓了，張開口來，亦未始可以作爲牛奶與麪包，圍巾呢，帽子呢，最切實的辦法，就是請到馬路先生家裏。</p>
<p>總之，在電車頭上來兜風，是樂事，至於，泥沙飛到眼中來遊戲，至於，黑烟飛到鼻中來暫住，那更不必說。</p>

<h3>死之岔道㈩</h3>
<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>收發處送進一疊信來，慕良在分理着，挺大的各機關各團體的公文，最乏味，幸而有粉紅的，湖色的，紫羅蘭色的小信，有些香味，把藍色的靛青味，紅色的印色油氣冲淡了。他算得特别優待，一封一封親自送到女同志的座邊，一個一個接受伊們的起立道謝，不過輪到自己，一封也没有心上温馨的信接着，未免對於寄給男同事的信，加以妬視，誰耐煩親自送給他們，捺一捺電鈴，喚一個勤務兵進來，命他分派給他們。這天天按時到達，天天照例辦的常課，又使他感到家裏的大夫人，如夫人，非但不興，並且討厭了。</p>
<p>究竟博愛？還是專愛？不，在没有把家裏疙𤷑的問題解决以前，不能别尋蹊徑，進行這愛的活動的。打下决心，在第二個月的下弦，請了一禮拜的假，還到蘇州。</p>
<p>大夫人先問他··「做事辛苦麽？聽說釣魚巷有堂子，去過幾回？」</p>
<p>慕良仰天大笑說··「太太！太不臨市面了，國民政府下，還有堂子存在的餘地麽？」</p>
<p>大夫人一臉子不相信的神氣說··「難道禁得凈絕的，只消看鴉片烟，越禁，吸的人越多了」</p>
<p>慕良說··「堂而皇之的堂子，是没有的了，不過要玩，另外有鬥檻。」</p>
<p>「如何？」大夫人表示伊的料事如神。</p>
<p>愛姑也來了，不知道不敢呢？還是不會？一句夠味的話也没有，只是淡淡的，質直的說了一聲不必回話的問話··「少爺還來了？」</p>

<p>任何市議董、倘經判决爲違犯本節之規定、應處以至多五十鎊之罰金、該市議董所被判决之法院得將其議董一職開除不補、但如證明、該市議董之違犯本節規定、係出於錯誤或疎忽、而非由於任何缺乏信用所致、則該法院不得頒發此項命令、</p>

<h3>第五張關係工部局職員地位之問題</h3>
<p>甲、外籍職員聯合會之建議</p>
<p>一、「上海工部局外籍職員聯合會」、爲經董事會承認而設立之一種團體、其主要目的、在於監護在工部局供職之外籍職員所有利益除供職警務處之職員、依照其服務條件、不得加入爲會員外、工部局之全體外籍職員、大槪皆爲該會會員、（註一）、公共租界統治機關組織法之改革對於工部局外籍職員之地位與前途、有何影響、爲一問題、該會曾以此項問題、由鄙人提出建議二、該會代表指明、在工部局供職之外籍職員、大都有一種意想卽該局常給予若　一種生涯若輩爲工部局所辦之事、當爲其畢生之主要工作、且望能分養老金及退職儲金之利益、設因改用華員之政策經被採用、或因服務條件之根本改革、而非因外籍職員自身之有任何過失、致使外籍職員、須於未至尋常退老年齡、並未合領取養老金資格時、被迫離職、則若輩所感受之困難、將極爲重大、</p>
<p>三、該會旋提出建議、謂在將地産章程所載之公共租界現行組織法、根本改革、而使工部局外籍職員地位或有不利之結果以前、産籌擬一種計畫、以保障外籍職員之利益、此種計畫、應爲任何所擬改革組織法之新辦法一部份、而付諸實行、並應設立一種特别委員會、以擬訂此項計畫、該委員會應由工部局及該局外籍職員聯合會所派代表、及專家組織之、並應包括一人或一人以上之華人委員、該委員會所擬訂之計畫、應具有兩種目的、</p>
<p>（一）在可能範圍之内盡量保證、使將公共租界組織法實行任何根本改革之日、仍在工部局供職之外籍職員、繼續任職、其任務條例、就酬報與利益、並就地位與升擢而論、當於前此所經享受者相同、</p>
<p>（二）應規定倘因組織法改革之直接或間接結果、致使外籍職員、在其本可期望繼續服務期限尙未終了之時、而被辭職、應如何給予充分之酬　報、</p>
<p>該會又滿而提議、謂在此種計畫之内、應有設立一種公斷委員會之規定、任何外籍職員、倘認爲依照此項所擬計畫之最後規定、應得酬報而提出要求、當由公斷委員會裁决、並應預撥特欵一宗、交由保管委員會保管、俾依照此種計畫而應給予之酬報、得在該欵項下支付、（未完）</p>

<h3>馬馬虎虎</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>處世藝術之六！</p>
<p>馬馬虎虎就不能做事，做事就不能馬馬虎虎，應該做而不做，就馬馬虎虎罷，不興。應該做好而不做好，就馬馬虎虎罷，不興。故馬馬虎虎四字，實是一種脆弱苟且心理的病態。</p>
<p>若照處世的藝術來講，不能如此，</p>
<p>有應該馬馬虎虎的，有不應該馬馬虎虎的，古人所謂「水清無大魚。」所謂「不疾不聾，不作阿家翁。」都是不能不馬馬虎虎的證例，人若處世，處處要鈎心鬭角，錙銖必較，未免做人太難，用心太苦，所以可以馬馬虎虎，便馬馬虎虎，如眞不可以馬馬虎虎，便不能馬馬虎虎，</p>
<p>古人有「小事糊塗大事不糊塗。」就是表示小事可以馬馬虎虎，大事决不能馬馬虎虎，此言是矣，然大事與小事，當以何者爲判别，原是一個困難的問題，查大小二字，原爲比較的名詞，並非絶對的名詞，譬如甲事，本來關係甚鉅，若遇乙事關係尤鉅，則甲事爲小而乙事爲大，假如甲事本來不大，而遇乙事關係更小，則甲爲大事，而乙爲小事，　　例如揚州徵稅風潮，關係一縣民生甚鉅，本來可算大事，然而比較魯省韓劉之戰，川省二劉之戰，則揚州爲小事，而川魯爲大事，揚州的事可以馬馬虎虎，而川魯的事，不能馬馬虎虎，川魯戰事，的確關係我國甚鉅，然而比較東省之失地，僞國之組織，則川魯事件尙小，而東省事件爲重，川魯事件可以馬馬虎虎，而東省事件决不能馬馬虎虎，　　現在我國對於東省事件，尙且馬馬虎虎，試問尙有何事不可以馬馬虎虎過去呢，馬馬虎虎的確是處世的絶妙方法，故勸人大家馬馬虎虎罷，</p>

<h3>一個簡便而圓滿的雪花膏製法</h3>
<p>— 履霜</p>
<p>天氣冷了，柔嫩的面上，需要一種潤面劑，蜜糖甘油等，因其太粘，所以大家不喜歡用，因此雪花膏得以佔第一把交椅了。</p>
<p>雪花膏的製法，散見各化裝品製造書内，可是你依了他的方法去做，得的結果，大多不圓滿，這不是他所介紹的方法不對，是由於他没有把詳細的方法指示。</p>
<p>我們在實騐室裏空的時候，也玩玩那東西，經了多次改良和試騐，得到下面一個簡便而好的方法。製出的東西，雖不及市上的頭等貨那樣好，也足於冬天使用，而價值非常便宜，諸君不妨試試。</p>
<p>預備司替林三兩，炭酸鈉六錢，甘油六錢，水六茶杯·香料，玻璃器或鋁製鍋子二只，火酒爐二只，玻棒一根。</p>
<p>手續··以上諸物均完備後，以司替林放入鍋内，加火溶之··烣酸鈉和水放另一鍋内，加熱至攝氏九十度左右。若此時司替林已完全溶化，將此炭酸鈉溶液（温度九十度左右），漸漸倒入，倒時須以玻棒拌之，同時下面仍須加熱。倒完後，將預備之甘油倒入，此時已成雪白之糊狀物。再熱約一刻鐘，此時火熖不可過大，隨熱隨拌。末後離火，置凉處候其冷。及完全冷後，再加香料，拌均即成。</p>
<p>注意·，</p>
<p>一，炭酸鈉溶液須至攝氏九十度左右，或至沸後，方可倒入司替林内</p>
<p>二，甘油可隨意加减，香料亦可隨意，惟須於冷却後放入。</p>
<p>三，司替林和炭酸鈉的份量，愈正確愈好。</p>
<p>四，冷後如厭其太乾，可於放香料之前，加沸水適宜，加熱須臾即可補救。</p>
<p>五，以上各原料，各西藥房都有，除香料外，其餘三種，每種一磅，約共需一元餘，香料比較貴些。</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3>蓄妾的商𣙜</h3>
<p>— 宗文</p>
<p>｜一個值得討論的家庭問題｜</p>
<p>「蓄妾」本是社會上一件萬惡的制度··在這裏，不知墮落了幾多女子的人格，犧牲了幾多女子的生命。它是專爲支解女性，而設備的兇器｜舊禮敎｜之一。所以我們要解放女子，使女子與男子在社會上有一律平等的地位，非得要打倒萬惡的「蓄妾制度」不可｜而它尤爲大家庭制度遺毒之一·，到了現在大家庭當在廢除之列·，因爲大家庭的害指不勝言，社會上面受其害的，不知幾多！所以東京時事新報譏諷我國内亂之插畫</p>
<p>中華民國</p>
<p>（譯文）「聯盟理事會將届」母親說··你們小孩子要好好兒不要吵鬧哇！聯盟的老伯伯來了應該有點禮貎啊！」</p>
<p>我們要大家庭不能存在社會上，先應得把蓄妾制度根本解决不可！委實它是一件殘忍非凡，慘無人道的事啊！</p>
<p>一夫一妻制本是很好的婚姻制度，可是有許多不自覺悟的男子，到現在尙醉心於一妻數妾主義，實視女子没有人格的了。於是在家庭中，就造成了一幕爭風，吃醋，的「家庭活劇，」或可說是一齣「家庭慘劇」也不知哩！使想這樣家庭中還有安樂的日子嗎？自畫至晚，只聽見詬誶，啼哭，打駡，怨歎，的聲音而已，這不是受了大家庭之害是什麽？上海市敎育局在城内城隍廟中竪有一塊極大的牌子，上面寫有··「若要家不和，討個小老婆。」並且還畫上了彩色的圖畫。好一個注目的標語，眞是千眞萬確哩！</p>
<p>但好好的家庭中，爲什麽要蓄妾呢？考其原因，不外乎下列三種··</p>
<p>㈠滿足自己的肉慾｜有許多男子，背有「不孝有三，無後爲大。」的金字招牌兒，在實行娶妾，而滿足他自己的肉慾·，這正是不肖的男子挾着萬惡的「錢」侮辱女子的罪案，他的目的，並不在於養兒子，或是厭惡他的妻子，委實他是要滿足自己的獸慾呢｜這大都在舊式專制家庭中爲最盛，而尤其是中國一般軍閥們，如狗肉將軍之家庭便是一例。</p>
<p>㈡爲的是兒子問題｜有些男子，實在是想要生兒子·，因爲他腦中深印上了孔子的一名··「不孝有三，無後爲大，」的老古話兒。但是自己妻子却偏偏又不生兒子，於是不得不娶妾了。其目的不外乎四點，即··㈠預防老境，㈡想吃羹飯，㈢傳種接代，㈣管理遺産。但此種現象亦在大家庭中爲多。我們時常聽見一句話呌做「娶妻生子」可見中國人結婚的目的，無非在於生兒問題，不生兒子當然難免要娶妾了。但是娶妾後，究竟能否生得出兒子？倒亦是一個問題呢。限於篇幅，不能細述。但是娶妾終是一件非人道的事，希望這一類男子，趕快覺悟·，如急於要兒子的，實行「養子」或「過房」倒也未始不可哩！</p>
<p>㈢不滿意於他的配偶！說來也很可憐，因爲不滿意於他的配偶，於是不得不私自蓄妾了。這一類多數在於舊式婚姻之下，是由「父母之命，媒妁之言，」成的配偶，終於不滿意他的對方，但是不敢與對方正式宣告離婚·，要滿足他性的枯燥，精社上的逾快，不得不實行娶妾了。但尙可原諒。這種人，大半是從痛苦中迫出來的自覺青年。唉！舊式婚姻眞是害人匪淺啊！可不愼哉！</p>
<p>但是我們要怎樣救濟這種蓄妾制席呢？以鄙見應要三方面進行，其方法如下··</p>
<p>㈠改良大家庭制，提倡小家庭制。｜這是根本辦法。</p>
<p>㈡法律方面救濟｜法律是保障人權的，男女旣一律平等，對於女子當有同樣的保障··應該在法律上規定取消蓄妾制度的明文，凡此後男子一槪不許娶妾，否則以重婚論。這樣，我想許多男子也不敢了罷！</p>
<p>㈢兩性覺悟｜男性應覺悟這是一種非人道的事，女性應尊重自己的人格，不甘墮落。應拒絶這類的婚姻。切不可貪了男子的金錢，而甘心作男子的奴隸才好啊！記着··「一失足成千古恨再回頭已百年身。」切不可自己殺自己啊！</p>

<h3>寒噤隨筆</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>秋風已硬着心腸將銀杏葉吹掃得遍地飄零，忙煞了清道夫收拾這敗北者的殘骸，這正值得多情的學者和道長們摇頭嘆息曰··「嗚呼！而今已矣，夫復何言？」</p>
<p>有錢的富家婆婆偶或施捨了一些冷粥冷飯，便有人讚揚她是「大慈大悲」，可是飢寒交迫的窮鬼無可奈何的偷了别人的三個銅板買了一個大餅吃，却有人指斥他是「取之不義」。天下人心如此，所以窮漢眞是難當。</p>
<p>中年人最希望的是金錢，老年人最希望的兒孫，這是人們的共同心理，尤其是我們中國人的特性。</p>
<p>我們在野坡上看着公牛打架，快樂，笑··還要大聲呐喊··外國人看見中國軍閥混戰，快樂，笑，也還要大聲呐喊。</p>
<p>天寒歲暮，東北義勇軍的鮮血，將白雪染成殷紅，所以我們當有金錢上的援助。但是還有更好的切實的援助辦法，那便是參加東北義勇軍去。</p>
<p>生活窮窘的時候，願意死去，然而苟有一線生機，却又對死感覺恐怖了。所以讚美死的始終是詩人的幻想。但是亡國大夫的偷生，到底不如爲民族鬥爭死去，這就是說一隻狗的生畢竟没有一羣螞蟻的死來得更有意義。</p>
<p>一夥頭顱勝過十夥砲彈，一具骷髏勝過十個美人。是以好男兒應當認清骷髏，擯棄美人，以火熱的頭顱擲到東北去，衝鋒，肉搏。</p>
<p>黃色使人厭倦，黑色使人絶望，紅色使人興奮，而白色便平淡無味了。</p>

<p>國際要聞</p>
<h3>好萊塢與美國總統選舉</h3>
<p>— 桀克</p>
<p>好萊塢向來好像一個與政治不發生關係的世外桃源，競爭選舉的政客，足跡没有到過攝影塲門前，全部的明星演員好像剥奪了選舉權似的，可是今年情形就不同了，好幾百個明星，今年要投票選舉美國大總統了，這是他們有生以來破題兒第一遭。</p>
<p>好萊塢選民的人數也不算少，許多競選的政客，開始向他們活動之後，好萊塢便一躍而爲有政治重要的區域了。</p>
<p>雷迭華公司在牠的攝影場裏大開筳席，欵待美國參議員候選人麥楷杜，並把全體職員向他正式介紹，華納又開一個政治的跳舞會，以麥楷杜爲特客，各攝影塲重要人員，都邀來參加，他們更組織一個羅斯福加爾納俱樂部，準備主持好萊塢市民大會，好萊塢的重要幹部人員，如盛納克，拉斯基，雷密爾，喜恒，孔哈里和麥克里等，都已表示贊助，美國電影界大有全體擁護羅斯福的趨勢。</p>
<p>米高梅公司方面情形稍有不同，哈斯特是熱心的民主黨人，梅經理却是一個胡佛總統的好朋友，曾經在白宮裏面住過，米高梅公司的人員，贊助民主黨呢，還是贊助共和黨呢，現在還無從確定。</p>
<p>美國電影界男女明星，今年因爲經濟恐慌等種種切身利害關係，一致要投票選舉，鄧愛齡，孟高梅，小范朋克和鮑爾斯，從前是舞臺人物，没有一定的住處，今秋才第一次投票選舉。</p>
<p>腦瑪希拉生長於加拿大，新近才入美國籍，她請了一位私人敎師，帮她研究政治經濟和美國歷史等學問，今年她也第一次選舉，瑪琍畢克馥也是加拿大産，幾年前她同屋文馬結婚的時候，才入美國籍，她同范朋克是明星中較有政治思想的人，所以一有機會，他們是不肯放棄選舉權的，今年他們尤其關心，范朋克現在國外旅行，他已請了代表替他投票。</p>
<p>瑪琳迪脫許，卓别靈，伊黎莎蘭娣，克利夫白樂克和希佛萊等明星，都還没有入美國籍，所以今年不能投票，麥克唐納向來把選舉權自動的放棄了，但今年已有了投票的勇氣。</p>
<p>久居好萊塢的明星，從前對於政治没有興趣，所以放棄選舉權的很多，珂琳瑪是其中的一個，戴樂，漢密爾敦，葛里古柏，彭里翁好琵琵但尼爾也是這類不願選舉的明星，琵琵現在已生了寗馨兒了，她爲盡母道起見，今年也要投票，康斯頓斯裴納特現在成爲有錢的女人，她爲稅則問題，今年也投票選舉。</p>
<p>還有一個惠爾羅吉，在民主黨全國代表大會推選候補總統的時候，他曾經得着六十六票。</p>
<p>談評影片</p>
<h3>評「努力」</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>從范倫鐵諾，死了以後影壇最被人崇仰的美男兒，總要算雷門納伐羅了，特别是他能受到全世界女性的歡迎。</p>
<p>他有聲片，是很多了，依仗了天賦的金喉，他比無聲時代，更燦爛了，無聲成名作賓漢和學生王子的光輝，都爲有聲的化外公子PaganLoveSong，才子佳人CallofAllFlesh，和最近的，奈何天MataHars等所遮没了。</p>
<p>今天國泰開映的努力Huddle，更是十足表現出他的青春仍在澎渤，他的藝術，更走到黃金時代中去，在這片中，他仍舊知道怎樣利用自己的天才，來博觀衆的同情，用他前半部的鄕間狀態和懦弱，來反襯後半部的勇敢活潑，表露出美英雄的情景，他的歌唱，雖然不多，却已夠我們去尋味了。</p>
<p>配角不算壞，｜當然不如奈何天中整齊，不過梅琪伊文，是很可誇奬的，飾父親的亨利阿米塔，也穿挿得不錯，把片子處處演成了喜劇。</p>
<p>導演方面，找不出一些漏洞，攝影和配光，也可以說都可取，景物似乎是眞在耶魯大學攝的，這片中很注意賽球的幾幕，動作很快，而且清晰，這不能不承認美國影界的技巧。</p>
<p>片中是把一個學生，由鄕村而到城市大學來，一步一步改革他的行動和環境，到畢業爲止，用極短的鏡頭，攝劇</p>
<h3>「快樂年」</h3>
<p>— 心</p>
<p>我們有了些煩悶的事，就希望把牠忘了，所以華納公司及第一國家等，都一致主張，一九三三的影片，要注重喜劇方面，使這未來的一年，成一個「快樂年」AHappyYear，差不多出品都用團圓作結尾，故事有悲味的，都改去了。</p>
<p>但是胸中抑鬱，無處發洩，悶他一年，是不得了的，這如何是好？</p>
<p>本中的四年，並不顯得粗略，對白也簡而明，每一句話，都不是可省的，所以的確很有力量。</p>
<p>描寫美國資産大學，一般「天之驕子」們的生活，很切實有趣，許多人唱的進行曲，也很能促起人的興奮。</p>
<p>總之，這片子是一齣大學生戀愛的喜劇，以外雖並没有深刻的意義，却至少是值得去欣賞的。</p>
<p>影塲瑣聞</p>
<h3>臨時演員的酸辛</h3>
<p>— 麥</p>
<p>月明影片公司。自從將大長城攝影塲盤了過來之後。所製的片子。都是售往國外南洋羣島方面的。所以武俠戲是他們出品中的大宗。</p>
<p>昨天他們開攝「賽拳場」一幕塲子裏的臨時演員。到擁了四十五人。並且兩架攝影機同時工作。一攝近景。一攝遠景。按理說。總得比單架攝機拍得快。但是他們從下午三點鐘預備。直到次日天明四時方才完工。所以臨時演員。大遭其殃。男的倒也無甚可說。祇是女的。那才可憐呢。家裏祇知他們下午七八時就可以回去。她們工作不完。又不能走。心裏的惶急。與雨後風寒的侵襲。時相交迫。不由得怨聲怨氣的哭泣起來。時間是那麽晚。車子也呌不着。公司的大門又像牢獄般的上了鎖。眞有挿翅難飛之感。身上越是單薄。四肢越是抖的厲害。肚子又餓。眞是飢寒交迫。男的臨時演員把他們的大衣脫下來。給他們披上。肚子仍是無維持。一夜半天的罪。她們也受了。代價是祇有一元二角（女的）。男的是一元。</p>

<h3>美國製造明星的方法</h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>「明星」這個名稱。原是歐美各國藝術界中人。借來形容一個出類拔萃的演員。或是演說家。或是交際家的一種尊號。在西洋劇塲裏稱「明星」。猶如中國戲院裏稱「台柱」。或是「大角兒」。你没有看見過美國影片裏映出後台化妝室門上畫了一顆五角的大星嗎？這間化妝室門上就寫着「明星室」的字樣。没有出類拔萃的藝術修養。當然不能進這明星室去做主人翁的。</p>
<p>電影在美國頂發達。崇拜明星的心理當然　推美國人爲第一。他們因爲要引起民衆對這些明星的注意。不惜犧牲大數量的廣告費。故意指使這些明星們在交際社會以及一切熱鬧的場合。鬧出一點小風波來。好讓這些受鉅額廣告費的報館用特號大字登出新聞。間接的使那些映演他們影片的影戲院可以塲塲車馬盈門。</p>
<p>原來羣衆心理。文明社會和野蠻社會一樣。都是崇拜大英雄大豪傑的。但是缺乏内亂與外患的美國社會裏。輕易那能建甚麽奇勳。創甚麽偉業？美國人就利用這個缺陷。用千萬枝燭光的自動電燈。炫耀大而無當的明星招牌。移轉羣衆崇拜英雄的心理來崇拜明星。但是美國的影片公司太多了。舞臺上與學校裏那能産出這許多明星來？於是乎製造明星的笑話層出而不窮了。瑪麗壁克福亨了盛名。於是乎相貎姿態稍微有點像瑪麗的鄕下大姑娘都被不遠千里而來的影片公司代表邀進都市去。硬派他担任一部影片的主角。</p>

<h3>談談『歡喜缘英』</h3>
<p>一般英國片子，在已往給我們的印象，太不好了，那種貴族式的表情，多而無意義的對白，眞是呌人感到厭倦，誰能料到這張歡喜缘，SunshineSusie，是一張大大的例外，</p>
<p>當我走入卡而登的門口，知道是一張英國片子，我心底發出了莫名的悵惘，但是散塲我走出那門口時，又感到無上的愉快滿意，</p>
<p>劇情是很平常，純粹美國式的戀愛故事，但是導演能把他演到極熱烈，好像給觀衆飮一杯濃郁的咖啡，</p>
<p>那些演員，是我們很少看見的，然而那些精彩的表演，可以說一聲「一嗚驚人」，鸞内美　，RenateMuller和傑克霍爾勃JackHolbert，兩人的輕妙細賦，大可追踪希佛萊麥唐娜之後，這片子的一切，也和幾張著名的「艷史」，走同一的途徑，</p>
<p>每一個演員的出場，都在極自然的條件下，避却了歐州片的通病牽强，凡是冷靜一些的叚幕，就用了合宜的穿挿，滑稽動人，全片一貫的用低音音樂配合，只要有一個小小的機會，便用歌曲來代表對白，不肯略略的放過的，就是火車打字，和别種機械的聲音，也配合成美妙的節奏，</p>
<p>雖然這樣，幾個演員，却並没脫離歐州大陸歌劇的意味，當然這種意味，是極有興奮能力的，如果按片子大致說，的確和「蒙底卡羅」，有幾分相像，而且一切「蒙底卡羅」的佈景，表演，節奏，歌曲，······牠都有，只是情節不同罷了，</p>
<h3>不論年齡</h3>
<p>— 靄</p>
<p>在好萊塢是不講究年齡的。瑪麗持蘭絲勒已六十歲了。但是一九三二年她當選了皇后！所享到的聲譽和歡迎。是任何青年女郎所望塵莫及的。約翰巴里摩亞今年五十一歲了。不但一樣的被推爲大明星。而且仍是常扮青年的情人。比年輕的明星更熱烈。還有一箇卡歐賽兒ChioSale面貎很美。年紀不到三十歲。而她的成功。却在于她飾那白髪老嫗。桃樂賽辟姆DorothyPetrems年才花信。却永久飾年長的母親。很少人能注意到她的青春美的。</p>

<h3>好萊塢影星的所得稅</h3>
<p>— 梅村</p>
<p>好萊塢影星的所得稅，從今年起另定了一個新稅率，大約較去年要增高一倍以上，因此一般明星，都感覺着不安，尤其是外籍的明星，他們除在好萊塢所付的稅項以外，還要担負其本國的稅欵，像却利卓别林，他要納付本國｜英國｜的所得稅等於全年進欵的百分之二十五，馬立斯希凡里MauticeChevolier也要付給法國一筆同樣的稅欵，</p>
<p>大明星約翰吉爾勃JohnGildert每年拍影片二張，可得美金五十萬元，此外他還有别的收入，也很可觀，他在去年所納的稅欵，是全數的百分之二十，可是今年他要付美金二十六萬三千七百十元｜他薪水全數的百分之五二·七｜這多麽可觀呀！</p>
<p>威羅羅裘斯WillRogers的薪水，是每年美金四十五萬，他也有一筆可驚的另外收入，我們雖不能詳細估計他的全年的總數，但是他的所得稅，的確佔收入的百分之五十以上，　　却利卓别林在「城市之光」一片裏頭，到現在已經售得美金三百萬元以上，按照所得稅百分之五七·一二計算，這個數目倒很驚人呢，</p>
<p>恩哈定AnnRarding今年拍了四張片子，每張的酬費爲美金八萬元，他今年的所得稅，按照百分之四十六計算，須納稅十四萬七千元以上，明年的合同上，他可以得每片十萬元的酬費，所以他的所得稅，也須增至十八萬元以上了，</p>
<p>羅斯察德登RuthChatterton和威廉鮑威爾WilliamPowell二人同華納公司訂了兩年的合同，第一年拍三片，每片酬十萬元，第二年再拍三片，每片增至十二萬五千元，所以他們明年的所得稅，每人須納十七萬元以上，</p>
<p>太魯拉彭海TallulahBankhead馬立斯希佛萊MauriceChevalier華雷斯皮來WallaceBeery雷門諾伐羅RamonNovarro襲斯開登BusterKeaton等的薪水，在二十萬至三十萬之間，他們應付的所得稅，大約在百分之四十至四十五之間，也要在十萬元左右</p>

<h3>Another Mystery: The US Presidential Election Unveiled</h3>
<p>The heated competition of the US election over the past three months has officially come to an end today. After March next year, the master of the White House will not be the fifty-nine-year-old Hoover but the fifty-year-old Roosevelt.</p>
<p>The Republican Party has been steadily in power for twelve years since Harding took office in 1921 until now. Although the person in charge has changed three times during this period, the traditional policies have not changed slightly. Moreover, taking advantage of the shadow of the World War, they believe that the prosperity of the United States of America will continue for ten thousand years and forever maintain its absolute victory. However, the stock market crash in the autumn of 1929 suddenly occurred, and the so-called Hoover market plummeted and could not be recovered. Although various stimulating methods have been used from last year to the present to incite the market to turn for the better, they have been ineffective. Especially after July this year, they have tried their best to encourage stock prices to rise. Although it has risen by several points, it has never reached the prosperous state of 1929. Therefore, it is increasingly known that the Republican Party's inability to grasp the hearts of the people is already obvious.</p>
<p>Now that Democratic presidential candidate Roosevelt has been elected, the platform he has put forward will be implemented in the future. In addition to the repeal of Prohibition, which can be implemented in a short period of time, other domestic economic policies will inevitably feel thorny.</p>
<p>First, the United States has been deeply affected by the economic panic. Although there are no accurate official statistics on the number of unemployed people, according to various professional estimates, it should be at least over 11 million. This is actually the biggest difficulty facing the United States and a common crisis shared by capitalist countries. Mr. Roosevelt promised to provide jobs for the unemployed when he was campaigning. However, it is difficult for American industry in general to suddenly prosper because of Mr. Roosevelt's election. Then, after he takes office as president, how can he have jobs to give to people who have no work to do? Moreover, the turning point of the world economy has not yet seen a real turnaround. Mr. Roosevelt himself may not be able to turn the tide single-handedly.</p>
<p>Second, the long-standing disputes between Europe and the United States are attached to the war debt related to the German reparations issue. The principal and interest of the debts owed by European countries to the United States total about 22 billion US dollars. The Republican Party originally adopted a procrastinating attitude toward this issue, perhaps fearing that it would be too obvious. Whether it is cancellation or collection, it will cause huge storms at home and abroad. The Democratic Party sings against the "cancellation of war debts," even if it wins the sympathy of domestic capitalists, or can stimulate the excitement of the public debt stock market, but the European countries' economic crisis and the "cash preference" and other complex intertwined relationships in the rescue of the world economic panic, even if the United States decides not to recognize the cancellation of war debts, what if the debtor countries are unable to repay?</p>
<p>Third, on the issue of tariffs, the Democratic Party platform states: 'The purpose is to have revenue tariffs for competition that are not subject to the interference of the executive branch, to establish a new fact-finding committee, to conclude reciprocal tariff agreements with various countries, and to promote world economic conferences to increase trade and make exchange transactions easier.' Mr. Roosevelt also attacked the Republican Party's protectionist tariff policy as much as possible during his campaign. However, both historically and in reality, the Democratic Party is not a free trade advocate but a considerable protectionist. The difference between the Democratic and Republican parties is only in degree. Moreover, the eastern, western, central, southern, and northern parts of the United States have different industrial and economic interests and viewpoints, making it difficult to reach a consensus. Therefore, although the Democratic Party advocates reciprocal agreements, how effective is its implementation? There is no doubt. Moreover, after the British Imperial Economic Conference, the economic alliance within the British Empire seems to be gradually forming. At this time, would it be easy to conclude a reciprocal tariff agreement with other countries that sacrifices their own country? Mr. Roosevelt cannot but be concerned about this.</p>
<p>Fourth, foreign policy issues did not occupy a special position in this US competitive election, meaning that there is no major difference between the two parties' foreign policies. Their main focus is on the Far East issue. Regardless of the Republican or Democratic parties, their policies toward China and their attitudes toward the Pacific hegemony are very similar. Moreover, they all advocate maintaining the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. They all hold the same attitude toward the preservation of China's territorial integrity, the open door, and equal opportunity. They also adhere to the "non-recognition doctrine" regarding Japan's invasion of Manchuria. The Democratic Party is no different in this regard.</p>
<p>We recall that when Japan forced China to recognize the Twenty-One Demands in 1915, the then-President of the United States was Wilson, who was a Democrat. His Secretary of State, Mr. Bryan, sent a letter to Japan on May 13 stating, "The treaty rights of the United States and American people in China, the territorial and political integrity of China, and the general open door, if any agreement detrimental to international policy is concluded between China and Japan, the United States cannot recognize it." This "non-recognition doctrine" has never been changed from Wilson to Hoover. Mr. Roosevelt, who comes from the Democratic Party, although there are some differences between his domestic policies and his relationship with European war debts and the Republican Party, the tradition of his Far East policy is difficult and impossible to change both in terms of momentum and reason. However, it may replace Mr. Stimson's verbal protests with actual preparations. Although Mr. Roosevelt has been engaged in the peace movement in recent years and is not as soaring as when he was Undersecretary of the Navy, he is also a practical politician. Although the Democratic Party advocates the independence of the Philippines, it has not allowed it to abandon its military privileges in the Philippines. It can still establish a strong naval fleet in the western Pacific. Therefore, in addition to giving the American people a drink to their heart's content, the master of the White House after March next year still needs to work hard. We sincerely wish Mr. Roosevelt well on his election as the new president of the United States.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan telegraphed from Beiping on the 4th, saying that three enemy planes suddenly came to Nehe County Town at noon on the 1st and circled for several weeks.

<p>they encountered Japanese troops traveling from Changchun to Harbin and jointly attacked Shuangcheng, driving away the volunteer soldiers. It is reported that many civilians were killed. (Reuters telegram on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Stationed in Manchuria Disarmed</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from the Japanese consul in Matsievskaya, Russia, 38 Japanese people, including five women, at the Japanese plenipotentiary's office in Changchun are still detained in Manzhouli. In addition, there are 125 Manchurian officials. The commander of the railway protection army summoned Captain Uno, the commander of the Japanese troops, to his headquarters on September 27 and demanded that Uno disarm his troops. Uno believed that the lives of Japanese residents were in danger, so he agreed on the condition of guaranteeing the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents. Therefore, Uno and the Japanese consul Yamazaki were allowed to return to the consulate. (Reuters telegram on the 9th)</p>

Wu Yicheng, led by Wang Delin, led more than 1,000 volunteer soldiers to ambush and intercept at a certain place (code name unknown) and hit the enemy's vehicle with hand grenades. The gasoline exploded at that time, and the Japanese troops fled and were surrounded by ambush troops. After a fierce battle, all the enemy troops were wiped out. In this battle, the enemy captured nine machine guns, more than 950 rifles, two mountain guns, four chase guns, and eleven boxes of bullets. On the 4th of this month, Wang's troops had occupied Hengdaohezi. The Japanese and rebel armies suffered 270 casualties. Wang's troops suffered 70 casualties.

<p>(Shanhaiguan) The volunteer army near Liangpeng Mountain in northern Jinzhou once attacked Jinzhou and is now holding on to wait for an opportunity. On the 5th, Japanese planes bombed the nearby miscellaneous woodland, Zicun, and Waiboshuzhuang, all of which were burned down.

<p>(Shanhaiguan) Except for the railway and the three districts near the county seat, the remaining five districts in the eight districts under the jurisdiction of Suizhong County are currently occupied by the volunteer army.</p>
<h3>Japanese Barracks in Suizhong Completed</h3>

<h3>An Da's Rebel Army Defects Entirely</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association received a telegram from the commissioner of Harbin, saying that a certain unit (code name unknown) of the Manchurian army at An Da Station, 6,500 men, defected entirely on the 6th of this month due to the pain of the Japanese army's brutal oppression. They are now united with the Soviet army to attack the Japanese army. The Japanese army is panicked and showing signs of retreat. All commerce in northern Manchuria has been suspended. The Japanese army only controls the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway to the Nu'er River and the western section to Fularji. The Japanese side has temporarily suspended the attack on the Nenjiang Bridge because the Chinese army's positions in the Hinggan Mountains are strong and many Manchurian troops have defected. Li Du and Ding Chao are now building a new government in northern Jilin and eastern Heilongjiang and issuing their own paper money, etc. (Special telegram on the 9th)</p>
<h3>Rebel Troops Stationed in Tao'an Prepare to Withdraw</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Zhendong of the Liaoning National Salvation Army telegraphed from the 7th, saying that the Japanese side feared that our army would attack Taonan and cut off its Siping-Taonan railway traffic, so it withdrew the troops stationed in Jilin and Heilongjiang to consolidate Changchun. The Zhang Haipeng troops of the rebel army stationed in Tao'an are grabbing cars everywhere to prepare to withdraw. If our army has winter clothes, it can approach Taonan quickly. Please transport leather clothes quickly. (Special telegram on the 9th)</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang's Army Attacks Luzhou and Neijiang</h3>
<p>Mu Yingzhou's Troops Attack Luzhou City Fiercely</p>
<p>The Two Armies in Neijiang Are at a Stalemate</p>
<p>Deng Tian Still Advocates Convening a Suining Conference</p>
<p>(Hankou) Mu Yingzhou attacked Luzhou, shooting from the south bank across the river. The Liao and He troops launched a fierce attack on the city on the 7th under the cover of two warships. The battle was fierce on the 8th. One Chongqing warship was destroyed by artillery fire. The Chongqing army in Neijiang retreated as soon as they came into contact. They are now at a stalemate. Liu Xiang plans to take Luzhou first, take Fushun, and then attack Zizhong. Now there is a change in the plan, saying that the battle near Gaoshikan in Fushun is also fierce and the outcome is undecided. (Special telegram on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chongqing telegram: 1. The war in eastern Sichuan is about to enter an intense period. The Allied forces are attacking Liu Wenhui's defense area in three routes. One is to attack Luzhou from Yongchuan, one is to attack Neijiang from Longchang, which is the main force of the Chongqing army, and one is to attack Zizhou from Anshan, which is under the command of the Daotian, Yang, Li, and Luo units. Liu Wenhui is determined to defend Zizhong, Fushun, Luzhou, and other places, which are the lifeline of his army. The outcome of the two sides will be determined in this battle. 2. In the battle of Zizhong, the vanguard of the Allied forces has occupied the first line of skirmishers of the provincial army. The Chongqing army is determined to attack Luzhou with all its strength and then completely block the traffic to Chengdu. 3. The Chongqing army's He Liuxiu brigade fiercely attacked Luzhou City on the 7th and has now stopped on the 8th. Liu Wenhui has transferred all the rear troops to Zizhong and Luzhou and ordered the garrison commander Tian Brigade Commander to defend to the death and not retreat. Liu Wenhui will arrive in Luzhou today to supervise the battle. (Special telegram on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Qun talked on the 9th that he had met Jiang on the evening of the 8th, but did not talk about Sichuan. Now that the war has been launched for a long time, it is difficult to solve it immediately. However, the plan to find a way to prevent it from expanding and prolonging it until the Sichuan situation is permanently stabilized should first seek the crux of the Sichuan chaos, such as military, political, and financial disunity, which have been the source of chaos for many years. A thorough reorganization should be carried out. The order issued by the National Government in the 17th year of the Republic of China can still be applied. I am studying its implementation. I will discuss it with Jiang in detail to facilitate its smooth progress. If I need to go to Sichuan, I will not hesitate to do so, but now is not the time. (Special telegram on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tian Songyao's representatives Wang Shuren and Xie Zimin said that the union of Deng, Tian, and Liu is purely propaganda from a certain party. This kind of rumor was true two years ago. The Sichuan situation has now evolved into a survival competition between the various armies and Liu Wenhui. This is absolutely not the case. Tian has always followed the central government's will in governing the army in Sichuan. At this time, when the entire Sichuan army and people are jointly seeking to improve the Sichuan situation, they should adhere to their original intentions and work together to achieve a thorough solution in a short period of time to relieve the central government's concerns in the west. (Special telegram on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Liu Xiang's subordinate Pan Wenhua's division attacked Neijiang and has arrived at Xiaoshi, saying that Mu Yingzhou and others attacked Lanzhou and have arrived at Dongjiezi. Both are separated from Liu Wenhui's troops by a small river. The battle has been fierce since the 8th. Chongqing planes often arrive in the provincial army's defense area and drop bombs, causing considerable casualties among the people. Liu Xiang will not accept any advice from any party until Luzhou and Neijiang are taken. Liu Wenhui has also ordered all units to defend to the death and seek an opportunity to counterattack to win the victory and issued air defense measures to be observed by the military and civilians. Deng Tian has always been consistent, on the one hand, supporting Liu Wenhui's plan to govern Sichuan, and on the other hand, still advocating the convening of the Suining Conference. Deng's troops have been transferred to Zizhong, and it is rumored that they will help Chengdu resist Chongqing. (Special telegram on the 9th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin telegraphed to Jiang Bocheng and Xiong Bin to first transfer Zhennian's troops to Huayuan Station on the Ping-Han Railway and then to Zaoyang and Suixian. Liu's troops still have 8,000 men. After Liu's troops are transferred, the defense of the counties in Jiaodong will be taken over by the provincial army. (Special telegram on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian's troops will begin to be transferred on the 15th. The route has been decided by the Military and Political Department. They will land in Haizhou and transfer to the Ping-Han train to Hankou. The Hubei, Henan, and Anhui Bandit Suppression Headquarters has drawn up the location of Liu's troops. After concentrating in Hankou, they will be transferred to Macheng and Suixian in eastern Hubei to carry out bandit suppression work. (Special telegram on the 9th)</p>

<h3>Control Yuan Decides to Impeach Case of Sale of Objects from the Forbidden City</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yu Youren of the Control Yuan will return to Beijing from Shanghai next Saturday. Before the previous month, the hospital reviewed an average of more than 60 cases of all sizes every day and sent people to Shanghai at any time. The Control Yuan believes that the case of ancient objects from the Forbidden City must be impeached. It is found that before the sale of the right objects, the committee issued printed materials explaining the reasons, saying that the ancient objects sold were 1. Those that have nothing to do with culture, 2. Those that are about to rot, 3. Those that are incomplete. However, according to the facts, a large number of gold utensils were sold, and more than 70 gold shops in Beiping competed to buy them. They were temporarily sold by the catty. It is conceivable that the weight of the large gold utensils sold was large. The price sold is only 30% of the current gold market. Even if the manufacturing cost of the gold utensils in the past is not counted, the reduction of gold materials according to the current market price is extremely inappropriate. At present, the Control Yuan has ordered the two committees Gao Lu and Zhou Lisheng to go to Beiping on the first day of this month to investigate. Once the evidence is confirmed, Yi Peiji and others, the directors of the Ancient Objects Preservation Committee of the Forbidden City, will be impeached. (Special telegram on the 9th)</p>

<h3>French Envoy's Activities in Beijing</h3>
<p>The Vietnam Treaty Will Be Resubmitted for Revision</p>
<p>(Nanjing) French Envoy Wilden met with Tieci and Zeng Zhongwu at the French Embassy's Beijing Office on the morning of the 9th, and then at 11:00 AM, accompanied by Counselor Baude, visited Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan. In the afternoon, he visited Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Gongbo for a long discussion. He planned to meet with Luo Wengan again on the 10th to discuss issues related to the Sino-French-Vietnamese border trade agreement and other Sino-French matters. According to the French envoy, most of the Sino-French-Vietnamese border trade agreement has already been signed, with only the list of taxable goods and other procedures remaining. He hoped that after consultations with Chinese diplomatic authorities, they could be agreed upon. Regarding the League of Nations' discussion of the Sino-Japanese incident, he expressed that while he had considerable opinions, he was unable to express them publicly before a detailed meeting with Chinese diplomatic authorities. Envoy Wilden only brought Secretary Gigout with him on this trip and will not stay in Beijing for long before heading to Shanghai. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-French-Vietnamese trade agreement, after being revised and signed on May 16, 1930, has not yet been promulgated by the French government due to issues such as the Yunnan surtax and Longzhou. As a result, Chinese expatriates in Vietnam are in a position of not having treaty protections, and the goods they import are subject to heavy taxes by the French, causing severe hardship and decline for Chinese businesses. Representatives Huang An and Xu Yixian of the South Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce returned to China to petition, and they met with a certain gentleman in the Foreign Ministry who said that French Envoy Wilden had come to Beijing from Beiping a few days ago and had already held one round of talks with Foreign Minister Luo. Currently, the agreement will be resubmitted for revision, and the Foreign Ministry is currently studying it. The main points of the revision will be the issue of the list of imported goods and the basis for the exchange of notes between Zhu Zhaoxin of Guangdong and Lagarde. Regarding the tariff aspects, the Foreign Ministry has already consulted the Ministry of Finance on the 9th, requesting them to send personnel to jointly study the matter so that the agreement can be concluded as soon as possible. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is rumored that the Foreign Ministry will consult with the French envoy on implementing the new Vietnam treaty. When asked by reporters, Zhang Weihan, the Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan who participated in the agreement, stated that, in his observation, the French side's attitude towards China has been very good recently, and Envoy Wilden has also made great efforts to promote Sino-French friendship. He believes that his arrival in Beijing will allow him to understand China's hopes and urge the French government to implement the treaty as soon as possible. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhu Jia骅 Concurrently Manages Educational Affairs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Education Weng Wenhao declined to take office, and Zhu Jia骅 will temporarily manage the ministry's affairs until a formal candidate is decided after the Third Plenary Session. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Interior Strictly Enforces Measures to Prohibit the Keeping of Slaves and Maids</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Interior has stipulated measures to prohibit the keeping of slaves and maids. The keeping of slaves and maids not in an employment relationship, regardless of whether through purchase, gift, or charitable means, is prohibited. The steps to be taken are: 1. Persuasion, 2. Emancipation, 3. Relief, and 4. Punishment. The directly administered municipal governments and the municipalities and counties under the jurisdiction of each province are to be instructed by the provincial and municipal governments to conduct thorough investigations through the police authorities and implement the measures in accordance with the steps. As for relief methods: 1. Unmarried slaves and maids who have a home to return to should be sent home. If they have no home to return to or their family members are unable to support them, they should be sent to the local relief home. If there is no relief home, they should be sent to a charitable organization. 2. Adult slaves and maids, regardless of gender, should be allowed to freely choose a spouse and seek other employment opportunities. Punishment methods should be handled by the judicial authorities in accordance with Article 313 of the Criminal Law, which deals with the crime of enslaving people. The slaves and maids kept should be forcibly emancipated and a fine of up to 300 yuan should be imposed. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zheng Tianxi Discusses the Shanghai Special Court Agreement</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Deputy Foreign Minister Zheng Tianxi stated that the report that the British Chargé d'Affaires in China was discussing the revision of the Shanghai Special District Court Agreement with the government was incorrect, as the ministry had not discussed the matter with him. As to whether the matter had been discussed with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he was not aware of it. Currently, the case is being handled by the Revision Agreement Committee jointly established by this ministry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Once it reaches a certain stage, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will notify the relevant countries to propose revisions. The government will naturally negotiate cautiously based on the principle of recovering legal rights. It is expected that revisions will begin when the three-year term expires next March.

<h3>Most of the Censorate's Impeachment Cases Have Been Delayed</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Although the main culprit in the Shuangqing Smuggling Case has escaped, the Censorate has not abandoned the case. As Chairman Chiang is handling the case in Hankou, it is expected to be investigated and handled through political means. The impeachment case against Chairman Xiong Shihui of Jiangxi Province has already been filed, and the current focus is on the Yangzhou land tax incident, which is being thoroughly investigated and will also be subject to impeachment. Those holding specially appointed positions who are impeached are dealt with by the Central Government Officials' Disciplinary Committee. However, the public officials' disciplinary committees of the various courts have been established for half a year, and the Censorate has sent a total of more than 140 impeachment cases, but only four cases have been executed by the committee. Among the four cases, two were sent back to the original agencies for execution, so only two cases have actually been executed. This is because the members of the committee are all legal professionals and each case must be handled in accordance with legal procedures, which causes delays and wastes time. In fact, the penalties for impeachment cases are only three types: 1. salary deduction, 2. dismissal, and 3. removal from office, and there is no criminal penalty. As for the regulations for the Central Government Officials' Disciplinary Committee, it has not yet been formally established. It is planned to have 30 members directly under the National Government, and the members will be appointed by the Chairman of the National Government, consisting of Central Supervisory Committee members and Central Political Council members. Currently, there are more than 80 impeachment cases of specially appointed officials that have been approved by the Censorate and are awaiting execution. They will all be handed over to the committee for execution once it is established. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Capital Residents Pay Attention to the US Elections</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After hearing the news of the US elections, Chinese officials said that regardless of which party is elected, the American people will demonstrate justice and fairness in their foreign policy, and that Roosevelt is deeply familiar with East Asian affairs and will be able to formulate a foreign policy regarding the situation in the Far East based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty to maintain world peace. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) People here are paying close attention to the results of the US elections today. The Chinese people have never paid so much attention to foreign elections as they have this time. This is because the League of Nations is about to convene, and the US representative on the Lytton Commission will also participate in the discussions. The relationship between the US and the future development of the Sino-Japanese issue is very important. General opinion is that US foreign policy, especially Far Eastern policy, will not change due to a change in government. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fujian Provincial Government Convenes a Financial Conference</h3>

<h3>Preliminary Hearing Held for Opium Smuggling Case</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Dawei, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the Jiangning District Court, held a preliminary hearing at 2 PM on the 9th for the case of Fan Guorui, a staff member of the National Government's Military Advisory Office, and others, who were involved in smuggling opium. The lawyers hired by Fan, Liu Zhe and Liu Bochang, appeared in court to defend him. First, Fan Guorui, Ren Zhongkun (orderly of the Chief Military Advisor), and Wang Jisan (manager of the Luoyang Sino-Western Hotel) were brought to court for individual questioning. The testimonies of the three were extremely cunning, each trying to shirk responsibility. Then, the three were brought face to face in court. Each side insisted on their own account of events, and the arguments were heated. The two lawyers also presented counter-evidence to defend Fan: 1) The authenticity of the writing on the calling card has not been confirmed; a re-evaluation is requested. 2) In the Luoyang Sino-Western Hotel, Ren Zhongkun said Fan was wearing a gray cloth military uniform, while Wang Jisan said he was wearing a white gown. The two testimonies are obviously contradictory, suggesting Ren Zhongkun intentionally framed Fan. 3) Wang Jisan did not confirm that Fan Guorui was an accomplice, so this cannot be considered evidence of a crime. 4) After the opium was transported to Beijing, Fan immediately reported to Section Chief Xiao Qin. If Fan was indeed an accomplice, he would have kept it a secret. Why would he dare to report it? 5) Section Chief Xiao should be summoned to testify in court. 6) In addition, Fan's colleague, Xiao Lan, was also present and should be summoned to testify. After the lawyers' arguments, the presiding judge declared that the case still required investigation and ordered the three defendants to be detained and the hearing postponed to a later date.

The first meeting was held on the 9th, establishing the following work priorities: 1. Determine the principles for resolving property tax disputes. 2. Review past dispute cases. According to those who participated in the discussion, in the entire city of over 100,000 households, since the residential property tax exemption was set at four yuan or less, and above four yuan at 5%, and business property tax exemption was set at two yuan or less, and above two yuan at 10% in the 18th year of the Republic [1929], there has been no change to date. This time, it was discovered that the number of households evading taxes exceeded 40%, so in order to reorganize finances and equalize the burden on the people, it was necessary to reorganize the system.

<h3>Investigation and Prohibition of Insulting-China Movie Screenings</h3>

<h3>Recommendation to Expedite Banking Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Changheng spoke about the Legislative Yuan's recommendation to the Central Political Council to expedite the formulation of the Bank Exchange Certificate Issuance Law and the Central Bank Law. The Central Political Council decided to hand it over to the Executive Yuan for drafting. The reason is that the issuance of banknotes by banks should be subject to government supervision to avoid excessive issuance and affecting the national economy. Therefore, laws must be formulated. In addition to the Central Bank, there are approximately two types of banks in our country: 1) joint government-business ventures; 2) provincial banks. The latter is prone to abuses due to a lack of restrictions. For example, Feng banknotes and Shanxi banknotes have become impossible to cash. In view of the current situation, the total amount of banknotes from each bank is approximately 500 million, while the capital of the Central Bank is only 20 million. It is impossible to concentrate all the debts of each bank to the nation. Furthermore, although the Central Bank has been established for several years, it is only based on the previous single regulations promulgated by the government, which are insufficient. Definite laws must be established. Moreover, to develop the Central Bank, commercial shares should be solicited, and the protection of commercial shares should be legally stipulated. As for the independence of the Central Bank, it does not mean that it is separated from financial supervision, nor is it limited to the Minister of Finance concurrently holding office. Legislation is a major national plan, focusing on laying the foundation for the Central Bank and ensuring that it can act as the national treasury and regulate finance. This is the main purpose of the recommendation of our Yuan. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Elected President of the United States</h3>
<p>Everyone Expected Mr. Roosevelt would Continue Hoover's Policy</p>
<p>Davis has been tipped to be Secretary of State</p>
<p>Europe Paid Close Attention and Japan expressed their good feelings</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Votes Created New Record in Presidential Election</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th - At 1 AM this morning, Roosevelt was elected President of the United States to succeed Hoover. Hoover has conceded defeat.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th - At 1:30 AM this morning, the Republican Party appeared to be collapsing, as Roosevelt had won in 38 states, gaining a total of 434 electoral votes. Hoover only won in 6 states, gaining a total of 70 electoral votes.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th - Around 2 AM this morning, according to incomplete election reports, Roosevelt had gained 453 electoral votes, while Hoover only had 78.</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 9th - The count of the US presidential election votes as of approximately 2:30 AM this morning showed that Roosevelt had gained 7,765,055 votes, while Hoover only had 5,249,165 votes. Later, as of 3 AM this morning, the reported votes increased to 9,676,891 for Roosevelt and only 6,611,361 for Hoover. Calculating the repeated election votes, Roosevelt can gain 469 votes and Hoover can only gain 51 votes. Among the state votes, according to the latest reports, only four states have more votes for Hoover than for Roosevelt: Pennsylvania, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont.</p>
<h3>Hoover Telegraphed Congratulations to Mr. Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th - President Hoover accepted the defeat with composure and telegraphed congratulations to Roosevelt, saying, "I congratulate you on the opportunity to serve the country. I wish you success in your political career. I am willing to do my best to assist you in matters where our goals are the same."</p>
<h3>Election "Landslide"</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th - The number of votes obtained by Roosevelt will become a new record in presidential elections. It is expected that he will have five million more votes than the 21 million votes obtained by President Hoover in 1928. The Democratic Party has won 472 of the 531 electoral votes. Mrs. Roosevelt supports herself by editing a magazine, teaching at a girls' school, and replicating antique utensils. She usually abstains from alcohol and told Reuters reporters today that she persuaded her husband not to lift the alcohol ban too much. After receiving the report of his election, Roosevelt issued a statement to the country, saying, "I am deeply aware of the responsibility that comes with this expression of trust and will do my best to promote the welfare of the country."</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th - The results of the election can be revealed as early as 9 PM tonight (Pacific Time). The total number of voters today is approximately 40 million.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th - According to the first unofficial report, Roosevelt has an advantage in seven states and has gained the support of 93 electoral districts. Hoover only has an advantage in three states, with 20 electoral districts supporting him. In Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, the number of votes for Hoover and Roosevelt is about the same. The election competition is extremely fierce in New York City and New York State. According to the first report, the number of votes obtained by Roosevelt in New York State is almost equal to that of Hoover. It is noteworthy that New York State has traditionally been the base of the Republican Party, but Roosevelt has gained more votes. As for the election in New York City, Roosevelt has an absolute majority. It is said that in this election in New York City, Roosevelt must obtain approximately 500,000 more votes than Hoover in order to suppress the Republican Party's advantage in other towns and cities.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th - The report received at 7 PM tonight showed that Roosevelt has an advantage in twelve states, while Hoover only has an advantage in five states. The southern states of the United States unanimously elected Roosevelt. States such as Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, Maryland, Tennessee, Nebraska, Virginia, and Arkansas all unanimously lean towards Roosevelt. Roosevelt also obtained more votes than Hoover in Kansas, Massachusetts, and New York State. Hoover only obtained the support of New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, South Dakota, and Connecticut. The number of votes for the two in Pennsylvania and Colorado is the same. Generally speaking, Roosevelt has a great advantage in the election trend.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th - The report received at 7:30 PM tonight showed that Roosevelt has a slight advantage in New York State. In the four rural counties of the state, the number of votes for Roosevelt and Hoover is the same, but in New York City, Roosevelt obtained 400,000 more votes than Hoover.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th - The report received at 9:30 PM tonight proves that Roosevelt has an absolute advantage. Roosevelt has obtained the support of 25 states, with a total of 284 electoral districts voting for him. Hoover obtained more votes in seven states, with only 88 districts voting for Hoover. Roosevelt won a complete victory in the southern United States, and Hoover is showing a trend of complete collapse. If Roosevelt obtains the support of 266 electoral districts, he can be elected. Roosevelt is currently calculating the number of votes obtained with his election manager.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of Roosevelt's Policies</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th – Roosevelt's election may not have a significant impact on the world. American tariffs will not be greatly reduced in the future, and both parties oppose canceling war debts, only willing to reorganize them to facilitate the export of goods from debtor nations to the United States. It is expected that Roosevelt will continue Hoover's policy of limited cooperation with the League of Nations, such as in disarmament, peacemaking, and restoring the world economy. Regarding prohibition, Roosevelt may prevent the amendment of the Prohibition Act, and may show greater sympathy for unemployment issues and related relief petitions.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 9th – The US President-elect has been confirmed to change from Republican to Democratic, and the 73rd Congress will also be dominated by the Democratic Party. It is expected that after the new president takes office on March 4th next year, he will surely implement new policies. President-elect Roosevelt will</p>
<p>offer a fresh perspective. However, according to observations by political leaders here, the new initiatives of the Democratic president will first be seen in diplomatic issues and domestic affairs with international relations. Except for the prohibition issue, there may not be drastic changes. Those familiar with current affairs also anticipate that although the person in charge will change, the policies of the old government will mostly remain the same, with only slight modifications. First, regarding the Far East issue in foreign policy, President Hoover strived to oppose changes to treaty status, thus giving rise to the so-called "Open Door Policy," which advocates that in situations that endanger existing treaties, the signatory nations must consult with each other and hold meetings. This policy was tacitly endorsed in the Democratic platform. It is said that President-elect Roosevelt had been closely following Far East events even before the election campaign, and it is expected that he will not change the policies of the previous government. Furthermore, according to those close to Roosevelt, he believes that diplomatic personnel should serve long tenures and should not be replaced lightly. Therefore, it is expected that Grew will remain stationed in Tokyo, and Johnson will remain stationed in China. Second, regarding the attitude towards the League of Nations, it is said that there will be no changes, because the government will only change its attitude after public opinion changes. Recently, Peek stated at the Democratic National Convention that the United States is not prepared to join the League of Nations. This statement is sufficient to represent the Democratic Party's stance. Third, regarding disarmament policy, it is said that in practice, it will mostly remain the same, with only some party leaders hoping for more direct involvement. Therefore, if the European conference fails, the United States may take the initiative to convene a subsequent conference. Fourth, regarding the war debt issue, although Roosevelt did not express his attitude during the election campaign, it is hoped that he will show slightly more sympathy than the Republican Party for the cancellation of all or part of the debt. In addition, there will also be few changes regarding Philippine policy, because since the economic decline, the Republican Party, in order to avoid Philippine sugar and vegetable oil competing with US agricultural products, has also supported Philippine independence. Also, regarding finance, the integrity of the gold standard will continue to be maintained. The next Secretary of the Treasury will probably be Mr. Young, who drafted the Young Plan.</p>
<p>Incumbent President Hoover</p>
<h3>Optimism in Geneva</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 9th – Roosevelt's election is warmly welcomed here as a precursor to the United States showing greater sympathy for Europe's suffering and closer cooperation with the League of Nations. Davis, the US representative here, whether he returns to the United States to serve as Secretary of State or remains stationed in Europe, his reputation and views will definitely energize the work of the Disarmament Conference. As for the Manchurian problem, it is expected that the Democratic Party will not greatly change Stimson's policy.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th – Europe is paying close attention to the US election. If Roosevelt is elected, all countries involved will pay attention to his policies on military needs, war preparedness, silver prices, and prohibition. Regarding the prohibition issue, it is believed here that if the United States implements the opening of alcohol prohibition, the profits earned by smugglers will become national taxes, which will make up for the US budget deficit.</p>
<h3>Japan Expresses Goodwill</h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th – Regarding the result of the US presidential election, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has avoided formally commenting on the election of the Democratic Party's Roosevelt as president, but the general observation is as follows: The Democratic Party, like the Republican Party, does not adopt imperialism and adheres to liberalism and coordination. Therefore, although there will be no substantial changes in its policies towards China and Japan, they may be more moderate than before. The Democratic Party is absolutely opposed to high tariffs, so Japan's trade may improve. As for the League of Nations, Roosevelt has criticized the current League of Nations, saying that it is not in line with Wilson's spirit, and may not be as close as Hoover. However, Stimson will come out and be active in the League of Nations General Assembly. Because he lost the election, he may not have an active attitude, which is more beneficial to Japan.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th – Because of the Manchurian issue and tariff issues, the financial community in Japan, which has been suppressed by the Republican Party, is very welcoming of the election of Democratic candidate Roosevelt as president. The liberalism of international coordination and tariff reduction advocated by the Democratic Party will also have a good impact on Japan, so the future of raw silk consumption is optimistic. In particular, if the independence of the Philippines is realized, it is believed that it will have a better impact on Japan-US trade.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th – Because the Democratic Party's Roosevelt was elected US President, the morale in all Japanese markets has become active, and market prices have risen. For example, the opening transaction price of the raw silk clearing market broke through 100 yen. Although the closing price fell, it stopped at 100 yen, and the stock market also soared.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th – Regarding the election of the Democratic Party's Roosevelt as President of the United States, the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Mr. Hisato, said that Roosevelt's election as President is not surprising. However, important issues such as the League of Nations' attitude towards the Manchurian problem, the World Economic Conference, and the war debt problem have all been temporarily suspended due to this election. Regardless of who is elected, from an international perspective, the end of the election is a good thing. The United States itself will be liberated from the election fever and return to normal, and will calmly study ways to resolve the world's panic. Although it is not known who will be the next Secretary of State, on the Manchurian issue, they will not adopt the stimulating attitude of today. The world's diplomatic circles will take Japan as the center to see the light. As a result, the Japanese financial world in general may be positively affected.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Hoover's Failure</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th – There are two reasons why President Hoover was not re-elected. One is the blind hatred of millions of Americans who are experiencing difficult times, and the other is that the Republican Party's propaganda and arrangements were not as perfect as the Democratic Party's. President Hoover's doubtful attitude towards prohibition also caused those in the same party who advocated for the relaxation of the ban to no longer support him. This is also one of the reasons why President Hoover was unable to be re-elected.</p>
<h3>Congressional Election Situation</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th – As of 1:00 AM this morning, the Congressional election report is as follows: In the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party won 107 seats, the Republican Party won 31 seats, and the results of 297 seats are still unknown. In the Senate, the Democratic Party won 9 seats, the Republican Party won 1 seat, and the results of 24 seats are still unknown.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th – Democrat O'Brien has been elected as the new Mayor of New York by a majority of votes.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th – Democrat Colonel Lehman has been elected as the Governor of New York State, succeeding Roosevelt.</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 9th – According to the reports received as of 1:00 AM this morning, it is expected that the Democratic Party will control the 73rd Congress. According to the reports, Democratic senatorial candidates have won in most of the twenty-seven states. The election of five Democratic candidates can be guaranteed, and the Democratic Party also has an advantage in nineteen other states.</p>
<h3>Democratic Party's Jubilation</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th – Tonight, Roosevelt hosted media personnel, his secretaries, Democratic headquarters staff, and many friends at his home in New York. Mrs. Roosevelt personally served the food. After the banquet, the group went to the Biltmore Hotel, where the Democratic headquarters is located. The scene of welcome was beyond description. Smith congratulated Roosevelt, who only smiled and nodded. Roosevelt seemed tired, but was very happy. Congratulatory telegrams arrived like snowflakes.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th – At 9:00 PM tonight, Mrs. Roosevelt, dressed in an evening gown, visited her husband at the Democratic headquarters. She was warmly welcomed when she arrived at the headquarters. At that time, Roosevelt was receiving reports of election results from various places by telephone. At the same time, many people in formal attire crowded into the Democratic headquarters, preparing to shake hands and congratulate Roosevelt, as the general public was convinced that Roosevelt would be elected.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th – Roosevelt's aides are now convinced that Roosevelt will be elected. They have made arrangements at the Biltmore Hotel in New York, preparing to hold a grand celebration on the night after the election results are announced.</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 9th – Roosevelt heard the news of the election victory and went to bed at 2:00 AM this morning. Because he wanted to see the reports from the Pacific coast states before making an announcement, he did not agree to make a statement tonight.</p>
<h3>A Brief Biography of Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, New York. As a child, he was taught by French and German governesses. At the age of fourteen, he entered Groton School. He enjoyed outdoor sports. In 1904, he graduated from Harvard University. The 26th President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, was his cousin. After the Spanish-American War, the United States actively promoted the navy, so he had a keen interest in naval issues. In 1905, he married Miss Anna. In 1907, he engaged in legal practice and had a special interest in naval cases. In 1910, he entered politics and was elected as a Democratic state legislator in his hometown. Later, he opposed the Tammany Hall faction, which caused a huge wave in the Democratic Party, and he gained fame for this. In 1913, he was elected to a consecutive term as a New York State legislator, but was also appointed as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Therefore, he had to resign from his position as a legislator and take up the position of Assistant Secretary of the Navy, which was close to his aspirations. The period during which he held this position was the time when the European War broke out, which allowed him to further develop his research on the navy and implement his advocacy for expanding naval armaments. He also dared to independently issue huge emergency military expenditures before Congress formally passed the military budget, and devoted his full efforts to seeking naval victory in the European War. He attended the Versailles Conference and had a good impression and affection for the League of Nations. From 1913 to 1920, he served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy for eight years. In the 1920 presidential election, he was nominated as the Democratic candidate for president. He delivered 1,000 campaign speeches, but ultimately lost to Harding and Coolidge. After the election defeat, he returned to his legal practice. In 1921, Roosevelt, who was already forty years old, was still in good health, but after the election defeat, he expressed a negative attitude because he no longer advocated naval competition, but instead advocated a naval holiday. In the winter of 1921, he went to Campo Bello Island for rest. He caught a cold from swimming in cold water, and after a sickness, he lost his health. His legs became numb and his movements became inconvenient, and he has not recovered to this day. In 1928, he made great efforts for Smith's presidential candidacy. Due to Smith's repeated urging, he came out and ran for Governor of New York State, and served until he retired in 1931. Since running for Governor of New York, all Democrats in the United States have admired his campaigning abilities. On July 1 of this year, he was nominated as the Democratic candidate for president. Today, he was elected as the President of the United States with a large majority.</p>
<h3>Japan's Large-Scale Military Expansion</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Cabinet Meeting Decided to Restore Allocations</p>
<p>Military Spending Will Increase by 56 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Naval Expansion Costs 460 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Issuance of Public Bonds Increased by 50 Million Yen</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 9th – According to the Japanese newspaper, the Ministry of the Navy has decided to quickly carry out its second naval replenishment plan and will ask the Diet to approve the necessary funds, which are estimated to cost 460 million Japanese yen. The funds will be appropriated over four years starting from the 1933-34 fiscal year. The naval replenishment plan includes two 8,500-ton cruisers, seven 1,400-ton destroyers, one 8,000-ton aircraft carrier, six submarines of various types, one minelayer, and some minesweepers and torpedo boats. The above projects will cost 360 million yuan, and the remaining 100 million yuan will be used to add five naval air squadrons. At that time, Japan will have more than 36 air squadrons. According to the Japanese newspaper, the Ministry of the Navy does not acknowledge this statement, but also does not deny that it is completely unfounded. Therefore, the public believes that this statement is not entirely without cause.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 9th – Regarding the Ministry of Finance's review of the requests for restoration by various ministries, out of the total amount of 285 million yuan including 130 million yuan from the Army Ministry, 60 million yuan from the Navy Ministry, 40 million yuan from the Ministry of Interior, and 20 million yuan from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, only 32 million yuan were approved by the Ministry of Finance. How this will be allocated is of great concern. As a result of yesterday's meeting of the Ministry of Finance, it was decided that the amount of the restoration request would be limited to a total of 32 million yuan, most of which would be used for military spending. How military spending and other expenditures outside of it will be allocated will be decided by today's Cabinet meeting. Because the Ministry of Finance and the military ministers are in political conflict over how to allocate the above-mentioned amount in the Army and Navy's restoration requests, today's Cabinet meeting only decided on the general outline of how to allocate the 32 million yuan, which includes the military spending in the original budget. A decision must be made after the military exercises.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 9th – The Army Ministry held a meeting yesterday to further discuss the restoration requests, all of which stated that there was no room for further reduction after several cuts. The Director of the Accounting Bureau, Mr. Onodera, visited the Director of the Budget Bureau, Mr. Fujii, at the Ministry of Finance yesterday afternoon, requesting the restoration of 130 million yuan, which included 60 million yuan for military equipment improvement costs and 70 million yuan for Manchurian incident costs. Mr. Fujii refused to approve it because he believed that the request was too large. The practical negotiations failed at this point. However, the Army Ministry stated that although 60 million yuan for military equipment improvement costs and a part of the Manchurian incident costs must be included in the budget, most of the Manchurian incident costs can be kept as reserve funds by the Ministry of Finance with a slightly wider amount. If the Ministry of Finance insists on limiting the issuance of public bonds to 800 million yuan, it will not be able to fulfill the mission of the military. Since the Ministry of Finance and the military have different views, the Minister of Finance, Mr. Takahashi, and the Minister of the Army, Mr. Araki, will have to resolve the issue politically, either in the form of an additional budget or by frankly admitting the restoration. In short, there is no other way but to increase the issuance of public bonds. As a result, public bonds may be increased by 50 to 60 million yuan.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo – At 11:00 AM today, an extraordinary cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence. Prime Minister Saito and all cabinet members attended. Finance Minister Takahashi said that he had conducted practical negotiations with various ministries regarding the restoration requests that had been reduced in next year's budget, but the results had not yet reached the stage of reporting. The proposed amount of restoration approval is limited to within 32 million Japanese yen. As for the military equipment improvement costs of the Army and Navy, negotiations are still underway with the military ministers. The above-mentioned 32 million Japanese yen is to increase the reserve funds for the Manchurian Incident costs, and the restoration of the various ministries will be left to the Finance Minister to handle. The ministers continued to express their opinions on the desired restoration. As a result, the reserve funds for the Manchurian Incident costs were increased by 10 million Japanese yen, and the remaining 22 million Japanese yen was allocated to various ministries.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo – After today's extraordinary cabinet meeting, Finance Minister Takahashi held political negotiations with Army Minister Araki and Navy Minister Okada regarding the reduction of military equipment improvement costs. As a result, the negotiations were generally completed. The content has not yet been released. However, it seems that the limit for the issuance of public bonds has been increased by 50 million yen to cover the military's restoration requests. Out of the limit of 32 million Japanese yen for approving the restoration requests, 10 million Japanese yen will be added to the Manchurian Incident costs, and the remaining 22 million will be allocated to various ministries. The final decision on this negotiation will be made today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo – Following today's cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Saito, Finance Minister Takahashi, Army Minister Araki, and Navy Minister Okada stayed behind to consult on the Army and Navy's restoration requests. As a result, a satisfactory solution was reached as follows: 1. In addition to the 10 million Japanese yen in the initially set reserve funds for the Manchurian Incident costs, an additional 10 million Japanese yen was approved for restoration. 2. The restoration requests of the various ministries will be supplemented with the remaining 22 million Japanese yen. 3. The total amount of the restoration requests for military equipment improvement costs is 90 million Japanese yen. The financial resources for this will be an increase in the issuance of public bonds. As a result, the Director of the Accounting Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy, Mr. Kato, visited the Director of the Accounting Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, Mr. Onodera, at 4:30 PM to negotiate the allocation of the 90 million yen. As a result, it was decided that the Army would receive 65 million yen and the Navy would receive 25 million yen. The Army and Navy authorities will base this on the settlement of accounts today and submit the budget proposal to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Stalemate in Japan-Russia Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Two Governments' Opinions Differ</p>
<p>Matsuoka Departed from Warsaw to Geneva</p>
<p>Reuters, Warsaw, 9th – Japanese representative Matsuoka and others arrived here from Moscow last night. Today, they visited government officials and departed for Geneva in the evening.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 9th – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Moscow reporting that Matsuoka's conversation with the Soviet authorities showed that the Soviet government believed that the Russo-Japanese non-aggression treaty and the Soviet Union's recognition of "Manchukuo" were mutually related. Therefore, it cannot agree to one and abandon the other. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on this today, saying that the Japanese government's opinion is that the two matters are completely unrelated. Therefore, the Soviet Union's recognition of "Manchukuo" should not be a condition for concluding a non-aggression treaty, as the conclusion of this treaty should be judged on its own merits and has nothing to do with external affairs.</p>

<h3>Japan's Arrangements for League of Nations Representation</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 9th – Regarding the composition of the Japanese delegation to the League of Nations Council and General Assembly, yesterday the Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructed Geneva as follows: At the beginning of the Council meeting, when formal agenda items are being discussed, Representative Nagaoka will attend. When discussing the League of Nations organization and other legal theories, Representative Sato will be responsible. When entering the main topic of discussing the Sino-Japanese dispute, Minister Matsuoka will be fully authorized to participate. In addition to Representatives Sato, Matsuoka, and Nagaoka attending the General Assembly simultaneously, the Director of the Japanese League of Nations Affairs Bureau, Mr. Taoka, as well as Deputy Director Bansho Shiji, Hotta Katsukichi, Yata Switzerland, and Minister Mushanokoji Sweden, will all attend as alternate representatives. Lieutenant General Tatekawa and military officers from the Army and Navy have also been appointed as specialized commissioners to attend the forum.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Prevention of Japanese Goods Dumping</h3>
<p>Imposing High Tariffs</p>
<p>Osaka Mainichi Newspaper reports that the Assistant Secretary of the Customs Bureau of the US Treasury Department, Mr. Dawe, issued a dumping evaluation on the 3rd for goods such as tuna, salmon, and electric bulbs imported from Japan, instructing customs officials to complete the investigation and at the same time instructing each customs to prohibit the import of Japanese goods. However, according to Mr. Dawe's statement, the import of Japanese goods has almost been prevented. In the Philippines, there is also a deep concern about the sharp drop in yen prices (Japanese-US exchange rate), and Japanese goods will inevitably be dumped in the port. Therefore, the Philippine Congress has, in accordance with the proposal of Governor Roosevelt, stipulated that tariffs on the import of Japanese goods should be levied in gold, which is also to prevent their import.</p>
<p>According to Kokumin Shimbun, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in the United States, Mr. Saito, reported that US manufacturers held a large public hearing from October 19th to 25th to discuss the problem of repelling Japanese goods. The resolution was to petition the government, stating that domestic factories producing matches, marine products, ceramics, electric bulbs, carpets, and other miscellaneous goods have closed down one after another due to the pressure from Japanese goods, and workers are unemployed. They requested that the authorities impose high tariffs and prohibit unfair low-price competition. Recently, President Hoover traveled around various places for the election issue, warning the people to pay attention to the threat of Japanese goods. Along the Pacific coast, the American fishing industry is facing a crisis, and the vegetable canning industry, food industry, bean industry, copper and iron industries, etc., are also declining day by day. They oppose the Democratic Party's low tariff policy and advocate imposing high tariffs on Japanese goods. Also, Conservative Party member John in the British House of Commons believes that the dumping of Japanese goods affects the silk weaving industry and strongly advocates suppressing it. The current British Chancellor of the Exchequer has ordered the Customs Advisory Committee to investigate the tariffs on Japanese silk fabrics. On the one hand, British silk fabric manufacturers are about to petition the Customs Advisory Committee. At the same time, Conservative Party member Levy has proposed a bill to prevent the import of Japanese goods to the UK and American territories, urging the government to quickly study countermeasures to avoid the bankruptcy of the industrial community.</p>
<h3>British Parliament Ends Discussion on Unemployment Relief Issues</h3>
<p>Many Suggestions from Various Parties</p>
<p>Still No Concrete Solution</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th – The three-day debate on the unemployment issue in the House of Commons ended today with a final speech by Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain. Many suggestions were put forward by various parties during the debate. The Conservative Party mostly advocated preferential treatment for farmers, and Lloyd George and others advocated developing small land ownership systems. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Horne of the Conservative Party spoke about prices and the position of gold and silver, saying that wholesale prices could be raised by restricting the supply of goods or changing the amount of gold coins. Some countries hoarding cash have led to a gold shortage, so the British may as well use silver to supplement the lack of gold. If silver prices rise, then the trade between Britain and China and India will greatly improve. If the international exchange rate is set to normal, it will be even more beneficial to world industry and commerce. The world has nothing more than a large amount of cash, but about three-quarters of it is held in the hands of two countries, so other countries do not have the necessary supply. This kind of problem is one of the major causes of the current situation. Today, the price of British currency is equal to the time when the United States first announced the cancellation of the gold standard, and the purchasing power of the pound in terms of goods is greater than it was five years ago. This is sufficient evidence that people do not need to worry about the depreciation of the pound. If silver is used in the appropriate position relative to the world's monetary system, industry and commerce can benefit more than any plan. Horne advocated that the state should subsidize the Cunard Shipping Company to carry out its plan to build two large merchant ships to provide jobs for the unemployed, and also advocated quickly abolishing the order prohibiting borrowing. Former Home Secretary Samuel hoped that the upcoming World Economic Conference would have the opportunity to resolve issues such as tax rates and monetary systems. This is necessary to restore prosperity and end unemployment. If the Disarmament Conference can have satisfactory results at the same time, then there will be enough courage to encourage the whole world to improve the economic situation.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain stood up to conclude the debate, saying that he found it difficult to accept the idea that raising silver prices could promote trade between Britain and China and India. China uses silver coins, while India does not. Therefore, as far as India is concerned, this statement should be based on the premise that the value of the silver stored by Indians is high, and India's trade with other countries can be expanded. Most of the silver stored in India is not for silver coins, but for silver ornaments. India used to store silver not as a medium for shopping, but as a sign of its wealth. In recent years, changes in silver prices have not been found in India's import figures. There is evidence that Indians use their hoarded silver to buy more goods from other countries when silver prices rise. As for China, the situation is slightly different. China uses silver. When silver prices are high, its currency value rises and its purchasing power is also strong, but its sales power decreases. An examination of China's import figures also does not show equal differences due to changes in silver prices. During the period when silver prices fell by 27 percent, China's imports only fell by 10 percent. He did not see that high silver prices could have much effect on the trade of Lancashire cotton with China and India. As for increasing the supply of hard goods to promote world wholesale prices, it should be known that the supply of gold has already increased greatly. In 1900, it was worth 1 billion pounds in English gold, and this year it has increased to 2.5 billion pounds. The discovery of gold mines in California and Australia in the 19th century and the development of gold mines in Africa thereafter meant that the supply of cash was greater than before. Gold coins were greatly affected, but since the number of increases has already been two and a half times in the past thirty years, even if large gold mines are discovered in the future, they may not have the same impact on the amount required for coinage. It has now been proposed that central banks should agree to accept some silver in proportion to gold at a certain ratio, and that this silver price should be the market price. If this is the case, then the market price will not be able to induce India and China to release their hoarded silver. China needs silver as currency, and silver does not come from China unless silver prices are high and China needs less silver. If silver prices rise to two shillings and there are 100 million ounces of the highest amount of silver, this is only an increase equal to 100 million pounds of gold in the supply of 2.5 billion pounds of gold. This kind of auxiliary supply is only about 2 percent, which is too small to have a significant effect. Therefore, he believes that using silver to help gold may not be beneficial in the current environment, and the central banks of various countries may not all agree to use this system. He did not make any compound currency proposals that could solve our difficulties. After the Chancellor of the Exchequer's speech, the House of Commons passed the Labour Party's motion, expressing Congress's anxiety about the unemployed and welcoming various relief methods.</p>
<h3>The German Government's Goals Remain Unchanged After the Election</h3>
<p>Industrial Circles Believe the Future Holds Many Difficulties</p>
<p>Reuter's, Berlin, 8th - After the parliamentary elections, Chancellor von Papen made his first statement to foreign journalists today, saying that the government's goals have been announced before and will not change in the future. Europe cannot have economic and financial order until the safety and development of the German people are guaranteed. He asked all countries to provide assistance because Germany will never recognize the conditions imposed by the victorious nations, whether through cunning or intimidation.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 8th - The Papen cabinet will hold an important meeting on Wednesday to study the political situation after the House of Representatives re-election. The issue of constitutional revision, which has been reviewed by the Minister of the Interior, and the issue of import restrictions will be submitted for discussion.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 8th - Political circles here predict that there will be no changes in the German political situation. The Papen cabinet believes that it has prevailed over both Hitler and the Catholic Center Party because Hitler lost two million votes in the election, and the danger of a union between the Center Party and the National Socialist Party has also been eliminated. However, industrial circles feel that the future holds many difficulties and are not so optimistic. Business tycoons are currently collecting documents to thoroughly study the government's policy of restricting import trade in order to prove that this policy is harmful to the country. Havas, Berlin, 8th - The new House of Representatives will have 583 members. The percentage of voters is higher than previously reported. The National Socialist Party won a total of 196 seats, which is more than the previous telegram reported.</p>

<h3>Chiang Returns to Hankou After Inspecting Hunan</h3>
<p>Will Depart for Jiangxi in Days to Convene Communist Suppression Conference</p>
<p>Methods for Resolving Sichuan Affairs Being Discussed in Detail with Dai and Zhang</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek went to Hunan from Hankou on the 27th of last month to inspect and visit scenic spots. He stayed in Yuezhou on the 28th and arrived in Changsha on the 29th. He once went to Mount Heng to inspect Hengshan and Hengyang counties, met with various division and brigade commanders, and gave speeches. Now that everything is finished, he departed from Changsha at 12 noon on the 7th aboard the Jiangkun shallow-water warship, escorted by the Jiangxi warship. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Song Meiling, Chief Guard Wang Shihe, and secretaries Li Wan and Deng Wenyi accompanied him. At 10 am on the 8th, they arrived in Yuezhou, rested for a while, and at 10:20, they changed to the Chuyou warship and sailed downstream, escorted by the Weisheng warship. When the ship passed Yuezhou, the General Headquarters received a telegram stating that they could arrive in Hankou at 7 or 8 pm. At 6 pm, Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters Cao Haosen, Secretary-General Yang Yongtai, Chief Advisor Zhu Shaoliang, Aide-de-Camp Chen Xizeng, Director of the Supervisory Office of the Party and Government Association Zhang Nanxian, and Garrison Commander Ye Peng all went to the pier to welcome him.

Chiang and Madame Song Meiling landed amidst the welcome and went straight to the Yihuo Village residence to rest. Important figures in Hankou, including President of the Examination Yuan Dai Chuanxian, Acting President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen, and Central Committee member Zhang Qun, all went to visit and discussed for a long time. Dai and Zhang made presentations on resolving the Sichuan affairs. It is said that Zhang also drafted a plan, which will be implemented after consultation with Chiang to prevent the Sichuan war from prolonging and expanding. Song made suggestions on financial issues. According to Song, who visited, Chairman Chiang is about to go to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression of the Red bandits and came here to discuss everything. The Third Plenary Session has been scheduled to be held on the 15th of next month. There will be no changes in the government internally at the moment. He will still return to Nanjing by plane on the 9th, and if there are no important events, he will not delay. It is said that Chiang's trip to Jiangxi has not yet been scheduled. He will probably convene a bandit suppression meeting with the generals in Jiangxi after everything is arranged to decide on the suppression strategy. It is rumored that the meeting is scheduled to be held on the 15th. If Chiang is unable to arrive at that time, it will be postponed. (November 8th)</p>
<h3>Navy Takes Over Defense of Yantai and Dongshan</h3>
<p>Liu Zhennian Welcomes Xiong Bin to Laiye</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - The Navy has been ordered to take over the defense of Yantai. In addition to the Hai Chen warship, which arrived earlier because it was closer to Yantai from Weihai, the Zhenhai warship carrying Gao Lingbai and the Marines sailed from Qingdao early on the 6th. Due to the strong winds, it anchored mid-way to avoid the wind and arrived in Yantai around the morning of the 8th. Xiong Bin sent Secretary Lu Bangjian to Laiye yesterday and met with Liu Zhennian today. Liu also sent a telegram to Jinan expressing his welcome to Xiong's visit to Laiye. The details of the news are as follows: The Zhenhai warship was delayed due to the wind. Today, I visited Jiang Bocheng at the Central Bank to inquire about the Yantai takeover. Jiang said that the Hai Chen warship arrived in Yantai yesterday and took over the defense of Dongshan in Yantai today. The Zhenhai warship, carrying Secretary Gao (Lingbai) and the Marines, did not sail on the 5th due to the high winds and sailed from Qingdao early on the morning of the 6th despite the wind. Unexpectedly, it still had to anchor somewhere along the way to avoid the wind due to the high winds. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Yantai today, but now it cannot. Secretary Gao sent a telegram today reporting that the ship will not arrive until the morning of tomorrow (8th). The takeover will be implemented under Gao's supervision. Liu Zhennian obeys the transfer order. I also asked Xiong Bin about the news of Liu's unit being transferred. Xiong said that the central government intends to order Liu to lead his unit to Anlu and Suixian in Hubei to suppress bandits. It was not immediately designated as Liu's defense area. Minister He had previously telegraphed Liu informing him of this matter. Today, he received a reply telegram from Minister He stating that he had received Liu's reply and fully complied with the transfer order. I previously sent two telegrams to Liu, and I only received his reply now, which was forwarded by Nanjing Radio. He welcomes me to Laiye. I sent Secretary Lu Bangjian to Laiye. He was slightly delayed in Weixian and only arrived in Shahe at 4 pm yesterday. According to the Cao Division Commander Fulintian Shahe telegram obtained by the provincial government, Secretary Lu will arrive in Yecheng today.</p>
<p>Song Shishan went to Yantai to supervise Zhang Xueliang because the Third Route Army withdrew from Yantai and Longkou. Liu Zhennian was transferred, and the navy opened the two places for interim defense. The Fourth Group Leader of the Military Commission Branch, Song Shishan, was specially sent to Yantai, and Councilor Fu Xingpei was sent to Laizhou. Councilor Peng Shibin in Jinan cooperated with Jiang Bocheng, Gao Lingbai, and Xiong Bin sent by the central government to supervise the handover. In addition to Peng Shibin's return to Jinan from Qingdao, Song and Fu also took the Pingpu train from Ping to Jinan this morning. Han Fuju sent Song Shiyan, director of the Ping office, to the station to welcome them. Navy Commander Shen Honglie also sent Staff Officer Bao Changyi from Qingdao to pick up Song and others. After getting off the train, they went to the Jiaoji Hotel to rest. Song Shishan then took the Jiaoji train to Qingdao with Bao Changyi at about 12 noon to go to Yantai to cooperate with Gao Lingbai in supervising the takeover. Fu stayed in Jinan for the time being and went to Laizhou with Xiong Bin. (November 7th)</p>
<h3>Zheng Tianxi to Inspect Judicial Conditions in Various Places</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Justice, in order to investigate the judicial conditions throughout the country as a reference for practical policy guidelines, must have the minister personally inspect at the end of each year. This year, Minister Luo is unable to leave Beijing due to business and sent Vice Minister Zheng Tianxi as his representative. It was originally scheduled to depart within days, but the judge's preliminary examination has not yet been announced and must be postponed for five or six days before departure. In addition to Vice Minister Zheng, Zhu Yutang and Ling Shijun were also hired as inspectors. Zhu has been working in the legal field for many years and has served as a judge of the Dali Temple and the head of the high courts in Jiangxi and other provinces. Ling is also a judicial elder and has served as the president of the high court. Both have extremely rich experience and knowledge and can be competent for this important task. Zheng and the other three each divided the region and took their staff to inspect the districts separately. Zheng inspected Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces. Zhu inspected Shandong, Shanxi, Beiping, Tianjin, Chahar, and other places in North China. Ling inspected Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and other provinces in Central China. Ling and Zhu will be able to depart in two or three days. The scope of the inspection was determined by the inspectors after days of consultation and the drafting of outlines. The general system is to inspect the courts, prisons, the adjudication system of each county, and the prisons of each county, paying attention to their work spirit and how to eliminate accumulated malpractices. The focus is on the judicial situation in each county today. The county governments in China also handle judicial affairs, and the general situation is mostly due to the old habits and accumulated malpractices. Therefore, the ministry should find ways to improve so that it can be slightly beneficial to the people in practical terms. It is heard that the inspection period will take about two or three months to complete.</p>
<h3>Judicial Yuan Interprets Legal Issues</h3>
<p>The Judicial Yuan's Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference recently resolved to interpret three items of legal ambiguity, which are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Temple Management: If a temple with a resident abbot was built or repaired by the abbot through donations, whether the temple should be abolished or not, its property is public property and not official property. (The standard for the existence or abolition of shrines is a matter of the existence or abolition of shrines, and has nothing to do with temple property.) It must not be allocated by local government offices to any group, and no local group may occupy or demolish it without authorization. If a temple with a resident monk or Taoist priest is dilapidated and can be considered abandoned, it should be handled in accordance with Article 4 of the Regulations on Supervising Temples. If there is no resident monk or Taoist priest, if it is a temporary state, the church to which it belongs or the competent government office should solicit the opinions of the monks and Taoists of the same religion in the local area and select a resident priest to manage it. Local groups must not occupy or demolish it.</p>
<p>Female Inheritance: If the property that a married woman should inherit has already been distributed by other heirs, according to the provisions of Article 3 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Retroactive Inheritance of Property, if her request for re-distribution is made more than six months after the implementation of the detailed rules, it should not be approved regardless of whether the distribution is appropriate. If it is after the implementation of the Inheritance Compilation of the Civil Code, it should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Implementation Law of the Compilation.</p>
<p>Inland River Vessels: If a vessel can only navigate inland rivers, even if its gross tonnage exceeds the limit shown in Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Maritime Law, it is not applicable to the Maritime Law because its nature is different from that of the vessels stipulated in Article 1.</p>
<h3>Truth About the Guangdong Air Force Accident</h3>
<p>Ye Xiasheng Petitions Chen Jitang to Honor His Son</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence - The truth about the Guangdong Air Force accident caused by testing the on-board radio with land communication is described in detail in a document submitted by Ye Daguan's father, Ye Xiasheng, to Chen Jitang. The document reads: "Submitting a petition for my son, Ye Daguan, who sacrificed his life for science and his ambition was not fulfilled, I pour out the true facts of what happened, pleading for a clear order of commendation to complete his legacy, to inspire and encourage future generations to strengthen the military and consolidate national defense. My eldest son, Ye Daguan, is twenty-one years old this year. Because I was traveling in all directions, he repeatedly lost his education. He only began studying in the junior class of Beiping Chengda Middle School at the age of fifteen. From then on, he followed me north and south, and the seats were not warm. In the autumn of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, when I was serving in the Northern Expeditionary Army, my son saw a military shortwave radio and began to study it, feeling that it was very interesting. So he closed the door and studied on his own, exploring the source and tracing the root. In less than a month, he was able to make a radio receiver from copper and iron without seeking external help. After a year, he returned to Guangdong and continued his research. He then served in the Materials Department of the Radio Bureau of the Ministry of Military Affairs. Fortunately, there were no mistakes for many years. Later, due to changes in the bureau's affairs, he resigned and returned home to study engineering school to make up for English calculations. Because of his diligent and tireless nature, he always burned the midnight oil, forgot to eat and sleep, did not take off his clothes until a lesson was finished, and did not set foot on the country until a plan was completed. He took saving the country with science as his duty every day and sacrificing himself for science as his purpose at all times. Since the January 28th Sino-Japanese War this year, he learned that the captured enemy planes seemed to have an aerial radio device, so he was able to detect intelligence and command easily. He then took it upon himself to invent this radio telephone. At first, he faced the wall for three months, as if he were a wooden chicken. Then, he threw up his sleeves and stood up, boasting that he had succeeded. I thought his ambition was commendable and gave him my support. The total amount was more than ten thousand yuan. In the autumn of this year, the Air Force learned of his ability and ordered him to go to the department for testing. From September 19th to October 21st, when the accident occurred, there were more than twenty tests. He was deeply praised by Commander Huang and Chief of Staff Lin, who believed that the results were remarkable and better than those of foreigners. Commander Huang also inquired and commended him, intending to award him a middle-level official position. My son declined because he was young and ignorant and wanted to study further. However, he still worked hard and diligently, without any thought of power or profit, and was sincere in defending the country from beginning to end. He never asked for a single penny and never hoped for a little vanity. His sincerity was already seen by Commander Huang and Chief of Staff Lin and has already been reported. I humbly hope that the accident in which my son was killed was caused by what reason, since the two people on board died at the same time, there is no way to stand up and testify. However, according to the investigation, my son had achieved excellent results in repeated tests and was not a novice trying for the first time. The three abalone bolts inside the engine of the destroyed telephone, the large and small rubber wires, were not melted, which does not seem to be caused by the telephone. My son's clothes and skin had no traces of electricity, which can be used to confirm. Now that the deceased is gone, why should I argue about merits and demerits? Even if I argue, what practical benefit is there? However, I remember that my son's aerial radio telephone, which was tested and effective, is of great importance to military and national defense. This achievement should not be covered up by a single flaw, and your generosity in encouraging the new aircraft and guiding the latecomers will surely not stop eating because of a hot soup. Therefore, I propose that Your Excellency investigate and verify the test results of my son's invention of the aerial radio telephone, issue a clear order of commendation, and order the Air Force Command to quickly select talented people to improve and continue to complete my son's unfinished legacy, to inspire and encourage future generations to strengthen the military and consolidate national defense. Then, even if my son dies, he should be grateful for the great virtue in the nine springs. Sincerely presented to Chen, Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group."</p>

However, he collapsed on the ground as soon as he entered the seat. The owner of the restaurant was shocked and immediately hired a car to send him to the nearby Minsheng Hospital for treatment. He died as soon as he arrived at the entrance of the hospital. Later, the owner of the restaurant and the Tiansantu Tu Zheng Xi Zhiliang of the place reported to the prosecutor's office of the county court to request that personnel be sent to inspect the body. Prosecutor Shen took his officials to inspect the body and confirmed that he had died suddenly due to old age and that there were no other reasons. The 29 silver dollars, 69 copper coins, and a dry tobacco pipe that the old man had with him were taken to the hospital to await collection. Lack of Funds to Build Grain Storage - The Wuxi County Government previously received instructions from the Department of Civil Affairs to build warehouses and rush to store grain, and attached the Interim Measures for Building Grain Storage, which was sent to the Food Management Committee for review and deliberation. The committee convened a meeting and decided that the county's grain storage funds had already been allocated and borrowed. The county government had previously requested that the one-tenth of a yuan per mu Qingzhang expenses collected this year be postponed for one year and changed to grain storage expenses. However, no instructions have been received so far. The Land Bureau has already been ordered to prepare the previous plan, but it is feared that it will be difficult to get approval. In order to take care of both, it is proposed to allocate half of the Qingzhang expenses collected this year to be used as grain storage expenses. If the case is unavoidable, we can only propose to temporarily collect five cents per mu for grain storage expenses in order to value the famine relief. Before approval is granted, grain storage cannot be carried out temporarily. We will submit a decision to the county government and at the same time, the seventeen district chiefs of the county will jointly submit a petition to the county government to forward it to the provincial government and ask the provincial government to approve the Qingzhang expenses of one-tenth of a yuan be used as grain storage expenses for a period of one year. The county government submitted the petition to the Department of Civil Affairs yesterday to forward it to the provincial government for approval.</p>

The Public Security Bureau was notified to investigate. Zhang Yiwu was found in Ren Port on the 7th with a box containing Buddha statues and porcelain, confessing that he stole them. However, they were not museum items. He also confessed that there were five accomplices. The museum case was done by Zhao De, a well-known bandit who has been imprisoned in the Fourth Prison for many years. He and his accomplices live on small boats on the inland river, drifting aimlessly, and commit theft at night. After committing the crime on the night of the 5th, they went to Haimen and went to Shanghai from Qinglong Port to stay at the Yuebin Hotel. This time, they agreed to meet there.

The current amount of rice and paddy in the market is estimated to be more than 141,900 shi, and more than 1,746,000 shi are distributed in various districts. Calculated by the average population of the county, this year there is still a shortfall of 1,500,000 shi, which needs to be supplemented by production areas.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province Prepares to Reclaim Coastal Wasteland - The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that there are more than 14,400,000 mu of unreclaimed wasteland on the coast of Jiangbei, which should be reclaimed to plant cotton. The 505th committee resolved to designate the Jiangbei salt reclamation area, from Dongtai Jiaoxie through Yancheng Funing to Chenjiagang in Lianshui, as a special reclamation area. The provincial government appointed Leng Yuchiu, He Yushu, Li Mingyang, and Miao Bin as preparatory members to organize a preparatory office to conduct investigations, classify the land as official or private, measure the number of mu, and determine the grade of the geology, plan the survey, and budget the engineering. The project requires 20 million yuan per year and a total investment of 100 million yuan over five years. Because the provincial treasury is empty, it was decided that Rong Zongjing would raise funds from the United States, which is underway. Preparatory members He Yushu, Miao Bin, and technical officers Xiang Kaiti, Zhang Pengzhou, and Xu Zhen of the Industrial and Construction Departments and others came to Tong from Shanghai aboard the Daqing ship on the 8th and stayed at the Clubhouse Hotel. He and Miao told reporters that this trip was to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the reclamation area.

<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Punishing Traitors Sparks Repercussions: Hang Da Sheng Cloth Shop in Qingfeng Lane, Shaoxing, recently received a large shipment of cloth from Shanghai, all of which was counterfeit Japanese goods. The Shaoxing Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association was notified via a confidential telegram from Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 7th, they dispatched an inspection team to the shop and other cloth shops for inspection. Hang Da Sheng claimed that the cloth was of British brand and refused inspection. The two sides argued, and the iron gates were closed, arousing suspicion among the inspection team members, who intensified the inspection. Eight large boxes, totaling more than 430 pieces, of counterfeit Shanghai Lun Chang and Wujin Dyeing and Weaving Factory Japanese goods were found on the spot. The Anti-Japanese Association sealed them and stored them at the county government. On the morning of the 8th, the association, believing that Hang Da Sheng Cloth Shop was secretly hiding a large number of Japanese goods and dared to resist by closing its doors and inciting a crowd, intentionally disrupting the national salvation work, convened a meeting of representatives from various legal entities. They decided to have the shop's person in charge, Shen Ji Ren, stand in a wooden cage according to the method of punishing traitors. A Mr. Zhou, who resisted on behalf of the shop, was paraded through the streets. The shop was sealed and will remain closed until the case is resolved. After the meeting, the decisions were implemented separately. The traitorous merchant Shen Ji Sheng was paraded through the streets and stood in a wooden cage for two hours before being sent to the Public Security Bureau for detention, leading to a city-wide strike by all cloth shops to support Da Sheng. Outside their doors, they wrote: "All employees of this shop support Da Sheng. Employees voluntarily suspend business to support Da Sheng." Da Sheng's employees went to the county government to petition.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Compiles Secondary School Curriculum Schedule</h3>
<p>Based on Ministry-Promulgated Curriculum Standards</p>
<p>Detailed Schedule Catalog Developed</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department, in order to improve the level of secondary schools, previously promulgated a plan to raise the level of secondary schools. Now, in view of the fact that the curriculum progress of various schools is often uneven and the levels inevitably vary, a committee was organized to hire experts to develop a detailed schedule catalog based on the Ministry-promulgated standards. Each week and each hour are specifically regulated so that both teaching parties have adequate preparation, so that the progress will not be uneven and the courses to be studied will be completed on schedule, which is the best way to improve the level. The department has drafted a budget and submitted it to the provincial government for approval. Here is an excerpt of the proposal:</p>
<p>Jiangsu is reorganizing education throughout the province and effectively improving the level of secondary schools. Since the 21st year of the Republic, graduation examinations have been held, and all facilities have been promulgated and implemented in order. However, graduation examinations can only determine the level of teaching performance of each school. In order to ensure that regular teaching is effective and progress is balanced, a temporary examination by the graduation examination is not enough. The Ministry of Education promulgated the Secondary School Curriculum Standards for trial implementation, and the provinces and cities reported separately, and the Ministry convened experts to revise them in detail. It is reported that the amendments have been promulgated in order. The department will implement the above curriculum standards to give secondary schools throughout the province the opportunity to innovate teaching and science. The standards issued by the Ministry only list the outlines. For practical implementation, detailed items must be compiled. It is urgent to examine the actual situation in the province based on the standards issued by the Ministry, and invite experts in social science and natural science in the province with experience in secondary education to jointly study and compile the progress of each subject's courses, and distribute them so that the teaching materials in secondary schools throughout the province are appropriate and the level is uniform. For all high school subjects such as civics, Chinese, English, arithmetic, zoology, botany, physics, chemistry, national history, foreign history, national geography, foreign geography, health, mineralogy, and ethics, a total of fifteen subjects. For junior high school subjects such as civics, Chinese, English, arithmetic, natural history, geography, and health, a total of eight subjects. Depending on the complexity of the courses, two committee members will be hired for complex subjects, and one for simpler ones. The temporary quota is 30 people. It is planned to convene a meeting during the winter vacation of this year, and the results of the research will be prepared for printing and distribution to various schools as a standard for implementation in the next semester. However, this matter is cumbersome, and the hired committee members must be specifically responsible. The estimated remuneration is at least 200 yuan per person, which totals 6,000 yuan for 30 people, and the costs of hospitality and printing are not included. This expense is not included in the department's budget. It is proposed to pass it to the Department of Finance to be paid from the provincial reserve fund so that it can be allocated at the time. Is it appropriate? Please decide.</p>

<h3>A Short History of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>In the autumn of the 15th year of the Republic, comrades in Beijing and Shanghai who studied early childhood education, in view of the importance of early childhood education and the lack of research institutions and related publications in China, in December of that year, united with comrades from the Gulou Kindergarten to organize the Early Childhood Education Research Association and publish the Early Childhood Education Monthly and the Early Childhood Education Series to discuss and study practical issues in early childhood education. This was the beginning of the association. In March of the 16th year of the Republic, more comrades in the domestic education community joined the research. In order to expand the scope, it was renamed the Child Education Society. At the same time, the Early Childhood Education Monthly was renamed the Child Education Monthly. In July of the 18th year of the Republic, education comrades from Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Beiping, Guangzhou and other places joined the research in increasing numbers. In July of the same year, a formal establishment meeting was held in Hangzhou, stipulating eight articles of association, deciding that the society would be a purely academic research institution, and that the purpose of the society was to study primary school education, early childhood education, family education, focus on practical educational problems, and provide concrete teaching materials. The society is now located at No. 50 Beijing Road. Branches have been added in major cities such as Nanjing one after another. There are more than 30 agency group members and more than 700 individual members distributed in Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Beiping, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Jinan, Anqing, Wuhu and other places. The second annual meeting was held in Shanghai. This year's second annual meeting will be held in Beijing.</p>

<h3>Appeal by Teachers and Staff in Hubei Province After Resigning</h3>
<p>Six Months and Ninety Percent in Arrears | Running Around and Appealing Yields No Results</p>
<p>Hankou, 7th Correspondence: All teachers and staff of Hubei Provincial schools and museums, due to the lack of payment and difficult living conditions, recently submitted a general resignation. All levels of schools were thus effectively on strike, and tens of thousands of young people suddenly lost their schooling. All teachers and staff telegraphed General Commander Chiang on the 4th, requesting prompt relief. The telegram read: "General Commander Chiang Junjian: Hubei education funds are six months and ninety percent in arrears. Running around and appealing has yielded no results. Recently, the provincial government's decision on education funding cannot reflect your concern for education and the actual lives of teachers and staff. Teachers and staff are unable to support themselves and are suffering from hunger and cold. They have no choice but to resign to the heads of various schools and museums. They respectfully request that the competent authorities be ordered to provide prompt relief, with deep gratitude. All teachers and staff of Hubei Provincial schools and museums kowtow in support." A declaration was also issued, stating the reasons for the resignation. The original text is as follows: "All circles should be aware that Hubei has unfortunately suffered from banditry and natural disasters in recent years, leading to economic bankruptcy and a failure to repair the administration. The impact on education is particularly significant. Since last year, education funding has been in arrears, especially much. As of now, four tenths of the December salary of last year, and all of January, February, March, August, and September of this year, and five tenths of July, are owed, for a total of six months and ninety percent of salaries. This is an unprecedented record in the education sector. In this situation, Hubei education has long been unsustainable, but teachers and staff are still enduring hunger and cold, trying to support it, adhering to the meaning of sharing difficulties and not wanting to see the education that is the lifeline of the country suddenly interrupted. They also hope that the government will have relief measures to solve the crisis. Unexpectedly, it has been delayed until now and there is still no result. The so-called clearing of salaries owed before April with the 21st year of the Republic's rehabilitation public bonds is just the face value of an unrealized bond. The so-called allocation of half of the newly added business tax is entirely for the salaries owed after July to the teachers and staff who were laid off this time, which is an empty principle with no fixed date or amount, and the reissuance of salaries to those who remain employed is still far off. The monthly salaries of teachers and staff were already meager, especially since February of this year, when they have been repeatedly reduced. Even if they were fully paid on schedule according to the cost of living in Wuhan, it would still be difficult to maintain. Now, even this small amount is unavailable. Their plight can be imagined. Moreover, since the four rural areas have been unstable in recent years, there is no peace of mind. Even if the teachers and staff themselves are willing to serve the public with empty stomachs, what about their parents and wives crying from hunger and cold? If they abandoned their parents and wives, it would not only be difficult for the teachers and staff to feel at ease, but it would also be against human nature. In the past six months, some teachers and staff have been evicted for defaulting on rent, some have been crying in their cold clothes because they have no way to cook, and some have died without medical care or burial expenses. As for borrowing and mortgaging, it has become a more common phenomenon. Recently, they have mortgaged everything and exhausted all means of borrowing. Therefore, the teachers and staff's request for the payment of arrears is driven by the pressure of life and the desire to clear debts and relieve accumulated difficulties, and is by no means a purely creditor-debtor issue with the government. If the government's current method of solving education funding is followed, it will not help the actual difficulties of teachers and staff at all. The teachers and staff, at a meeting of all representatives on November 1, decided to resign to the heads of various schools and museums to seek other livelihoods. At a time when the country is in great difficulty, all compatriots should endure hardships and share difficulties. However, a careful examination of the facts is not entirely the same as other institutions. The salaries of the personnel of many agencies were paid up to September, and the salaries owed to the laid-off personnel were also paid in one lump sum (this is the case with the Education Department). The same are citizens, the same serve society, and the same are subject to the jurisdiction of a government, but the treatment is different. What would their feelings be if they were in each other's shoes? What is even more puzzling to the teachers and staff is that the Education Department, as the highest administrative organ for education in the province, bears the heavy responsibility of raising education funding. However, it has always been perfunctory and has never provided any relief measures. If the teachers and staff make any requests, they are either delegated to the provincial government or the General Headquarters, as if the establishment of the Education Department is only for show. This has greatly disappointed the teachers and staff. Education is the foundation of the nation. This is true in Europe and the United States, and the late Premier Sun's founding program clearly stipulates guaranteeing independent education funding and raising teachers' salaries. However, Hubei's education funding has not only been in arrears until July, but it has also been repeatedly reduced. In reality, the salaries received are less than those of the clerks and recorders in various agencies. This not only affects the lives of teachers and staff, but also seriously violates the late Premier's will and hinders the development of the country's future. This is another issue that must be appealed sincerely, hoping that society will pay attention. In short, all teachers and staff have received considerable education and are not ignorant of their responsibilities to the country and society. If they are able to do so, they are willing to make every effort and will never betray their conscience and make excessive demands to belittle human relationships. This resignation is truly a last resort. Teachers and staff are not only pained by the bankruptcy of education, but also feel the lack of livelihood. Both public and private matters are plagued and anxious. They earnestly plead for understanding and assistance.</p>
<p>The association's funding shall be provided by the following items." I have received your query, and I hereby inform you that I have received your order, and I hereby order you to inform you and comply with it. I hereby issue this order to inform you and comply with it separately.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Football Match: Tung Wah Wins Against British Navy</h3>
<p>Result: 7 to 1</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Tung Wah football team defeated the British Navy team with a score of 7-1 at the baseball field. This was a friendly match. The following is a record of the events:</p>
<p>The strength of the Connaught team was mediocre. Tung Wah originally planned to play a mixed team of the Army and Navy yesterday, but due to the short notice, they were unable to arrange it. Instead, the Connaught team from the Navy played. This team's strength was mediocre and could not withstand the strong Tung Wah team, resulting in a one-sided game with few highlights.</p>
<p>Li Yichen Opens the Score. The game started at 3:00 PM. The Navy kicked off and launched a spirited attack directly into Tung Wah's territory. After multiple attacks, Lu Zhongen defused the danger. Wan Xianghua attacked on the left, but lacked support in the center, making his efforts futile. Soon, Chen Jiaqiu dribbled the ball past two defenders and passed it in front of the goal. The goalkeeper rushed out to save the ball, but Li Yichen took the initiative, hitting the goalkeeper with the ball, which bounced back to Feng Yunyou in front of the goal. The goalkeeper had not yet returned, and Yichen shot into the empty goal, successfully opening the scoring.</p>
<p>Jiaqiu and Yichen Score Again. After the kickoff, in less than three minutes, Tu Kaiyuan threw the ball from the left sideline. Chen Hongguang passed it to Wan Xianghua on the left, who ran forward and crossed the ball directly in front of the goal. The goalkeeper caught it but fumbled, and Jiaqiu charged up and kicked the ball into the net. The goalkeeper panicked and was helpless. Afterwards, Li Yichen received a pass from Hongguang and scored another goal towards the left corner, making the score 3-0.</p>
<p>The First Half Ends 4-1. After conceding three goals, the British team vowed to counterattack. They advanced from the left, and Parsons made a solo breakthrough. Wu Youliang could not turn around in time, and Yin Zhengda's defense was insufficient. Parsons entered the penalty area and quickly shot the ball, which rolled along the ground and into the net, as the Tung Wah goalkeeper, A-Lu, could not dive for the ball. Soon after, the British goalkeeper, Bowdler, made another mistake, and Chen Hongguang rushed forward and scored. The first half ended 4-1.</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu Scores Two More Goals. After the break, the morale of the British team waned. After several back-and-forth plays, Chen Jiaqiu took the lead and scored two more goals, making the score 6-1.</p>
<p>Li Yichen Scores with a Header. At this point, the British goalkeeper was injured and replaced by the right inside defender. The replacement goalkeeper's skills were better than the previous one, and he saved many dangerous shots. Finally, Li Yichen scored with a header, making the final score 7-1. The referee was Li Silian.</p>
<p>Tung Wah Lineup:</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen, Li Ning, Yin Zhengda (replaced by Guan Xun'an), Tu Kaiyuan, Feng Yunyou, Wu Youliang, Wan Xianghua, Chen Hongguang, Li Yichen, Chen Jiaqiu (replaced by Chen Yutian), Cao Qiuting.</p>
<p>British Lineup:</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>We have read a correction published in the Education News Correction column of your newspaper on the 4th of this month, regarding the incident of the 6th District Security Regiment of Jiading County detaining and assaulting students of our school. We find this correction rather laughable. The Regiment's brutality and unreasonableness towards our school's students, the beatings that caused injuries, and the use of handcuffs were witnessed by almost all residents of Huangbo Town that day. Section Chief Xiang of the Education Department, Principal Zheng of Shanghai High School, and Mr. Di Feng from the enemy side came to our school and heard the details firsthand. However, after reading the letter from the Regiment, not only did they deny and conceal their actions with cunning words, but they also falsely accused our students of injuring their sentry soldiers and falsely accused our Principal Teng Songshi of acting arbitrarily and oppressing the Regiment. We students are all young people in our teens, how could we have the courage to injure the Regiment's soldiers who were armed and fierce like tigers and wolves? Our Principal is an educator with no weapon in his hand, how could he act arbitrarily and oppress the Regiment? This is self-evident. The details of the incident, in addition to the report by Principal Zheng of Shanghai High School and Mr. Nishitani to your newspaper's reporter, which reported the truth and was published in your newspaper on the 2nd of this month, have also been thoroughly investigated by officials sent by the county governments and county party headquarters of Jiading and Qingpu counties, who have understood the true situation. The general outline of the incident was also briefly published in the local communications columns of your newspaper, Xinwen Bao, and Shibao on the 6th of this month. At this time, our school can only wait for the official authorities to investigate and handle the matter according to the law. We do not need to refute the Regiment's cunning denials and false accusations. However, we fear that those far away may not understand the true situation, so we specially issue this statement and hope that your newspaper will publish it on our behalf. We wish you good health.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Student Self-Government Association of Huangdu Rural Teachers School</p>
<h3>New Basketball Techniques (20) (8) (Not Permitted) (to be Reproduced) Original by Claire Burcky, Translated by Zhang Guoxun and Qian Yiqin</h3>
<p>The Southern California Trojans had an outstanding record in last season's Pacific Coast Conference. This pivotal offensive method is their winning weapon.</p>
<p>Number 1 first gets the ball and passes it to Number 2. Immediately after, Number 1 goes straight down the sideline behind Number 2. Number 3 immediately goes to the free throw line to act as a pivotal point of reception. After receiving the pass from Number 2, Number 3 turns around and passes it to Number 4, who is diagonally passing behind to the left of Number 3. If Number 4 can remove his (Number 4's) defender, he can directly attack the basket. However, in this situation, the monitoring of the opponent's defenders is extremely strict. Therefore, Number 4 is forced to pass the ball to Number 1, who is advancing along the opposite sideline.</p>

<h3>Financial Bar Gold Plunges, Small Rebound</h3>
<p>Complex Process, Small Difference. Yesterday, on the last day of the Autumn Race, the gold market was still only open for half a day in the morning. The falling trend of the bar gold slightly subsided, but the trend of a large fall followed by a small rebound was very complex and the difference was not large. Transactions among colleagues in the morning were relatively active but the amount was not large and intentions were hesitant. Afterwards, it rose slightly by one or two taels. The price of silver initially rose slightly due to the US presidential election, but it was not affected by the big news and then fluctuated between 736 and 737 taels. When the foreign exchange rate was stable, it was suddenly reported near noon that Roosevelt was likely to win the US presidential election. As Roosevelt advocated raising the price of silver, a falling trend suddenly started. Sellers were everywhere and it finally dropped to 34 taels and 8 mace. Fortunately, the exchange rate was still stable and rebounded slightly. The Central Bank also sold US dollars to Taikang, Runda, Dadecheng, etc., totaling about 700 bars, which were calculated at US$223. The market will be closed after today's trading. The market situation of the previous session is recorded below.</p>
<p>Consecutive Drops for Three Days, Rebound of 9 Mace. The opening price for December was 737 taels and 2 mace. Although the silver bar rose by one-eighth, the proportional increase was 1 tael and 3 mace (estimated to be between 6 and 7 taels before the market opened).

At 10:10, the price was 7 taels and a half. Hengxing and others sold again, losing 1 tael and 0, to 6 taels and 2 mace. Suddenly, it was reported that the Central Bank was dumping spot goods, and Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang and others rushed in. Also, the bank absorbed 4.375 of the February's US dollar, so the price was raised by 1 tael. At 10:30, the price was 7 taels and 2 mace. Afterwards, there were slight advances and retreats. After 11:20, a storm suddenly arose. It was reported that Roosevelt would definitely win the US election, and the people's hearts were shaken. Various firms and Tong Taichang, Yuanchun, Hongli, Hengyu, Yifeng, Hengchangyong, etc. sold heavily, and the exchange market seemed to be broad. In a few minutes, it was reduced by 2 taels. At 11:30, the price was 34 taels and 8 mace. Finally, HSBC absorbed 30 yuan of the December's US dollar and Maccary absorbed half a yuan of February's US dollar. Zifengyongda, Dadechenghengyu and others took the opportunity to enter, immediately pulling up about 1 tael. At 11:45, the price was 6 taels and 7 mace. It then rebounded by 5 or 6 mace to 6 taels and 9 mace because Hengxing bought in. At noon, the price was 36 taels and 8 mace, a rebound of 9 mace from the previous noon (a reversal of three consecutive days of decline). According to the half-day, the maximum was 7 taels and 7 mace and the minimum was 4 taels and 8 mace, a difference of 2 taels and 9 mace. Looking back, the bare metal was added by 11 taels and 2.25 mace.</p>
<p>Quotation Finally Suppressed by 70 Taels. The quoted US dollar suddenly changed back to 807 taels, a decrease of 70 taels. Near noon, it was 72 taels before and after. Finally, the 70 taels were 1 tael less than the previous day. The bookkeeping was 39 taels in November, 37 taels in December, and 38 taels for water replenishment.</p>
<p>Inconsistent Inflow and Outflow, Weak Quantity. Table Transactions Differed Significantly.

Various banks did a lot of trading with each other, probably because the bar gold seemed to be on an upward trend. However, after a large fall, there was a small rebound. As US President Roosevelt has been elected, the gold industry believes that the price of silver may rise, and people's hearts seem to be apprehensive. The market is still closed in the autumn race.</p>

<h3>Securities Finance Overall Six Soars 3 Yuan</h3>
<p>｜Other securities also rise by 1 yuan to 1.78 yuan｜</p>
<p>｜Market situation is very strong with more than 9.7 million in transactions｜</p>
<p>Yesterday (9th), the bond market situation of the Chinese Securities Exchange was still slack, with only 21,000 yuan traded. The futures market continued to rise in price and the atmosphere in the market was very lively, and buying and selling transactions became more and more smooth. The good market situation was only seen this year, with more than 5 million traded in the morning and more than 4.6 million in the afternoon, totaling 9,715,000 yuan. Among them, salt tax reached more than 1.99 million and unified tax reached more than 1.67 million. Bonds such as 20 customs, demobilization, and 19 customs duties also reached about 1 million yuan each. However, the trend of each bond price in the morning and afternoon was still clear, and the atmosphere in the market was very good. All parties were rushing to collect and transactions were very strong, and empty accounts were also actively supplemented. Although the selling transactions were not deserted, the situation of demand and supply was very different and various prices soared rapidly, even stronger than before. In addition to the fact that the fixed tariff of 96 was more peaceful, the department continued to rise significantly. For example, the overall six finance soared by 3 yuan, the demobilization spot and unified tax spot rose by 2 yuan, and other bonds rose by 1 yuan to 1.78 yuan. It is heard that the firm rise in bond prices is due to a slightly better situation, and because the national treasury is seeking another source of income and will no longer rely solely on the financial industry, it should be the biggest reason for increasing buying enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Shows a Slight Bullish Trend</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is slightly rising, but the trend is still flat. Because the actual demand is still sluggish, all helpers have no excitement. The reason is that the silver is still difficult to loosen. However, Rongxing's long position is safely unchanged, but the majority of individual investors are looking bearish. In the afternoon, because US President Roosevelt has been elected, it is hoped that the world's commerce may recover, so people's hearts are good and the short side still has no intention of compensating.</p>
<p>The human bid is slightly better by 5 or 6 qian. The human bid opened in the early market, and the market sentiment was good because the US cotton market was closed and the new throwers were relatively scarce. Each month rose by 5 or 6 qian. The market situation was still good in the afternoon, with a near-term increase of 1 or 3 qian and a flat far-term. The total transaction volume for the day was 12,500 bales. It was found that Yichang sold 950 bales, Suijiang sold 500 bales, and Tonghe sold 350 bales. Daji bought 400 bales, Dachangcheng bought 400 bales, Yicheng bought 900 bales, Changfeng bought 850 bales, and Rongxing bought 400 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>The closing price of the human bid rose and fell, and the number of accounts was 21,466, an increase of 5, 38,150.</p>
<p>November 14,333, an increase of 4, 44,3503, 14,604, an increase of 2, 41,50.</p>
<p>December 14,406, 68,6504, 14,626, 67,50.</p>

<h3>More New Buyers in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Cotton prices rose because there were more new buyers and the market gradually showed signs of turning around. However, the amount of short selling by a certain manufacturer remained unchanged, and there was still the intention to continue selling, so the pressure was still heavy. However, some people heard that the prices in various production areas were difficult to loosen, and their minds were more expensive to purchase and do more. In addition, US President Roosevelt was elected, and they were deeply afraid that US cotton may have a bullish outlook.</p>
<p>The Zheng bid is gradually showing signs of turning around. The Zheng bid opened in the early market, and the market sentiment was good because the US cotton market was closed and the news was stable. The number of sellers in the market decreased and each month rose by 2 or 3 qian. The market atmosphere was quite strong when the afternoon market opened, but it turned weak at the close. As a result, each month was flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 48,900 dan. It was found that Suijiang sold 2,200 dan, Xincheng sold 1,000 dan, Yuanda sold 2,200 dan, Dachang sold 5,300 dan, and Taichang sold 1,300 dan. Changfeng bought 4,600 dan, Xinheng bought 1,700 dan, Tongxing bought 1,200 dan, and Renfeng bought 1,000 dan. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<h3>British and Indian Cotton are Softening</h3>
<p>｜US Cotton Election Shutdown｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was closed due to the presidential election. British cotton futures fell by 3 or 4 points, spot fell by 4 points, Egyptian cotton fell by 9 points. Indian cotton softened due to broker selling and long positions closing. Penguoer fell by 3.75, Robi Aomla fell by 3.5, Robi Bairoxi fell by 2.25, and Robi Yuandianlu Zuo (8th dispatch).</p>

<h3>Rice Market Arrives in Prosperous Sales and Weak Demand</h3>
<p>In recent days, a lot of Nantou rice from South Shanghai has arrived. The stock in the port is abundant and people's hearts are calm. The price of Hougeng is falling, and there are no transactions for late rice Feilaifeng guest help, and the price is 2 jiao lower. Lu Yangjian and Bianyin Yuanchou Rongruo all have a foot volume of about 1,000 shi throughout the day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 50 ships from Inland help arrived in North Shanghai. The transactions on this street are becoming sluggish day by day. The opening price of Baige early rice was reduced by 3 jiao. Jiangyin and Kunshan rice also followed with a small 2 jiao. The price of Chen Po Dao sales was unchanged, and the price of Yang Du Jian was short due to the influence of foreign rice.</p>
<h3>Guest Xian Arrivals and Sales Both Lacking</h3>
<p>｜Foreign Rice Sluggish｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was unusually sluggish. Both local and guest help did not inquire. The cargo owner insisted on maintaining the market, and the situation was in a state of disuse. There were no new arrivals of guest xian yesterday. The previously arrived Hunan rice has been distributed by the trade, and the estimated price is similar to the previous opening price. Fuzhou help bought 50 packages of newly arrived Jiangxi Yuan rice, and the price was slightly 2 jiao less than the previous selling price, only 10 yuan and 1 jiao and a half.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Turns Stable After Fatigue</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month was generally flat and the fatigue trend was seen. The price of foreign wheat quoted by Canada fell by 2.4 jiao, so people's hearts were already weak and the environment was like that. The opening price for each month was slightly 1 fen lower than the previous day's closing price. The market atmosphere improved slightly after the customers drew near the recent period of factory selling was not very smooth and the highest time returned good 5 li. When the afternoon market opened, the transactions in each month had been light and buying and selling were not abundant, and the selling atmosphere was even quiet. The Nanyang help had slight gains in the forward and because of the U.S. presidential election or with wheat prices related to the mind slightly stable not called due also. As a result, the current month was good for 5 li compared to the previous day, December was good for 1 fen and 2 li and a half, January was good for 7 li and a half, February was good for 5 li, March was unchanged, and April was good for 2 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market in Quiet Fatigue</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning, prices for all months generally trended towards a flat and fatigued state. With imported wheat quoted at a slightly lower price of 24 cents, confidence was naturally unstable. However, due to the lack of smooth selling by actual sellers, merchants were considering hedging imported wheat. Therefore, although confidence was fatigued, the degree of decline was minimal. By the afternoon opening, there were no transactions in November and December, and very few in other months. However, due to the renewed stability in the flour market, prices were also slightly raised. However, given the surplus of global commodities, future development is generally considered difficult. Consequently, November and December remained unchanged, January increased slightly by one cent, February improved by one cent, and there were no other comparisons. The current wheat market is very quiet in terms of arrivals and sales, so there is no trading to be done, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse and White Sugar Down by 5 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was flat and fatigued, with no improvement in the benchmark prices. Therefore, the association's trading floor continued to decline. No. 24 coarse white sugar was marked at 14 taels and 8 mace, down 5 cents from the previous day, but there were still buyers. No. 20 medium white sugar had thin inventory, marked at 14 taels and 3 mace, and the market remained stable. No. 18 medium white sugar was at 14 taels, followed by 13 taels and 9.5 mace. The calling prices for Nos. 8, 9, and 10 Dutch red sugar remained as before, with no transactions. The price for small-packaged local factory ice sugar No. 1 was 16 taels and 7 mace, and No. 2 was 16 taels and 6 mace. The Shanghai factory and others sold some. There was also a batch of goods from a certain factory, but due to the lower quality, although they wanted to sell at the same price, there were no buyers. It is likely that a slight reduction will be necessary to complete the transaction.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Honey Date Market Price Plunges</h3>
<p>｜Down Two to Three Taels Compared to Before｜</p>
<p>Since the rebound, honey dates were initially quite firm. Recently, as sales have become scarcer, prices have gradually loosened. A check of the previous market showed that the highest price for Anhui T-grade *tututu* dates reached 31 to 32 taels, and Lanxi dates were at 27 to 28 taels. The current market has dropped by two to three taels, and transactions are few. Yesterday, Anhui factory *tututu* dates sold for 28 to 29 taels, and Lanxi *tututu* dates sold for 25 to 26 taels. All other upper and lower grades followed the previous example, with the trend being flat and fatigued.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: White Silk Factory Warp Sold Poorly</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth day of the autumn races, and foreign firms followed the usual practice of taking the afternoon off. There were no updates from overseas silk telegraphs. Although European and American firms had inventory, their offered prices were still low. Chinese silk merchants were unwilling to sell at a loss. Silk sales from inland silk shops were also very scarce, and prices also tended to weaken with the trend. Yesterday, 20 packages of Grade B top-grade 20-22 denier white silk factory warp, newly arrived from Hangzhou silk factories, were priced at only 500 taels. Ten packages of Golden Horse brand top-grade Qilibai dried silk warp from Zhonghe were priced at 415 taels.</p>
<h3>Lyon Raw Silk: Actual Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>｜Silk Fabric Inventories Are Ample... Raw Material Consumption Greatly Reduced｜</p>
<p>French silk fabrics, such as Parisian satin, have a wide sales market and a long-standing reputation in Chinese and foreign markets. Since the global economic instability, French silk exports have long been sluggish. Recently, the political strife in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States has led to repeated fluctuations in exchange rates, making silk sales even more sluggish. Inventories are piling up, and the consumption of raw silk by various silk weaving factories has been greatly reduced. Actual sales are stagnant, and silk prices have fallen sharply. The current market price for Chinese and Japanese 22-denier silk has fallen by 10 to 20 francs per kilogram compared to mid-September, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Fine Eyebrow Tea: Active European Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British merchants such as Xiehe and Jinlong in Tunxi’s high-end fine eyebrow green tea trade reopened due to receiving telegrams from Morocco requesting supply. The entire city negotiated more than a thousand boxes to start trading. The opening market price ranged from 72 to 78 taels. Wuyuan Eastern Route goods were priced at 87 taels, a drop of two to three taels compared to before. There were also slight transactions in Qimen black tea and Gongxi green tea, but selling prices generally trended downward. Currently, although French merchants are showing slight activity, foreign firms are reporting that Japanese and Taiwanese teas are competing aggressively at low prices, and the market is likely to fall rather than rise.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<h3>Qingdao Businesses Handled Over 20,000 Loads of Hardware Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hardware trading was very brisk yesterday, and the trading by Qingdao businesses was unparalleled by other groups. It was found that the goods handled yesterday totaled over 20,000 loads. Among them, Wenxing, Chang Yongxing, and Chang and other firms had particularly strong appetites, leading all other groups. The goods handled included mostly old iron products, scrap iron, foreign metal heads, used rubber tires, English steel plates, black iron sheets, and tinplate, while plain white iron, French-style nails, and new lead wire were less common. The appetites of Tianjin, Hankou, and Fujian businesses seemed somewhat limited. Overall, judging from the current situation, the prospects for hardware have improved significantly. Given the limited amount of long-term delivery goods currently available, the market is destined to improve further in the future.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3>New Season Tung Oil Enters the Market</h3>
<p>｜Abundant Harvests and Increased Production in Various Regions｜</p>
<p>New tung oil has begun to arrive. In the Jinlan area of Zhejiang Province, several shipments can be produced daily, with a purchase price of 16 yuan per *zhu*. As new goods enter the market, there is not much fluctuation. Chen Oil of Hangzhou firms has already sold out and is urgently preparing for new oil. It is reported that some firms have handled hundreds of shipments of local tung oil from the Jiaxing area at a price of around 20 yuan, to be delivered by cart. The production volume of tung oil in Jiahe and other places will soon peak. This year's harvest has been extremely abundant, so the price of new oil is half as low as last year. However, it is reported that the Shao businesses in that area are heavily involved in tung fruit purchases, initially at 6 yuan 23 cents, later falling to 5 yuan 56 cents, but recently increasing again to 5 yuan 89 cents. Therefore, oil prices are not as weak as they were a few days ago. The cheapest rumored price among local firms is 20 yuan delivered to Shanghai, but according to yesterday's news, it must be 20 yuan and 5 cents. Information from Jingzhou and Yichang in Hubei Province, which are somewhat distant from Shanghai, is not very reliable. However, according to detailed Hankou reports, the harvest is also good, and with the bandits suppressed in various producing areas, the oil mills can also resume their previous operations. It is estimated that this winter's production volume will increase compared to previous years. Furthermore, there is still a lot of old oil in Hankou, and it has recently fallen to 13 taels for Chongjing oil and 12 taels and 34 cents for Pingjing oil. High-quality factory city oil is also at 12 taels and 56 cents, while the lowest quality Tianjin oil is only slightly above 11 taels, but the quality is not very reliable. Local firms have not accumulated much inventory, so they are all focusing on new goods, it is said.</p>
<p>Coal</p>
<h3>Zhongxing Coal in Extreme Short Supply</h3>
<p>Arrivals of Zhongxing coal have been scarce in the past month, so the amount of coal stored in various warehouses is limited, totaling less than 3,000 tons. Sales have been extremely active recently, with both local and external firms buying in large quantities. Yesterday, the market saw over 500 tons transacted, with prices being exceptionally firm at 11 taels and 25 cents per ton, it is said.</p>

<h3>"Truly No Bargaining"</h3>
<p>— Bi</p>
<p>｜Commercial Transportation｜</p>
<p>"Suzhou people bargain, half price," is a common saying among Shanghai people to describe how shops do not have fixed prices and customers can haggle freely. In fact, the half price of Suzhou people still has a standard, for example, if the asking price is two yuan, haggling down to one yuan is acceptable. However, Shanghai people who mock Suzhou people's half price often bargain for more than double the price. "Ask for the sky, pay on the ground," that is truly absurd.</p>
<p>However, Shanghai people's asking for the sky and Suzhou people's half price are the same in "work" but different in "tune." For the same one-yuan item, Suzhou people ask for two yuan, so the customer bargains down to one yuan, and the deal is done. Shanghai people, on the other hand, use the same method. A one-yuan item, under the golden sign of "Truly No Bargaining," is marked with an original price of ten yuan, and red and green strips of paper are pasted on the large glass window, proclaiming "regardless of cost" and "big sacrifice," "discounted to 90% of the original price." Thus, the customer can also close the deal for just one yuan.</p>
<p>"When entering a country, inquire about its customs." Each place has its own habits, so I have some thoughts and feel that there is an urgent need to promote "commercial ethics," otherwise you will suffer everywhere you go. Therefore, I now hope for "commercial transportation." What is commercial transportation? Well, for example, when we take a train, send a letter, or send a telegram, the price is fixed and unchangeable. Not even a penny less. The gentleman sitting behind the counter, no matter if you call him "sir" or "master," is iron-faced and merciless. You can't expect to get any favors. No matter if you are a local bigwig or a country bumpkin from afar, you are treated the same. So I hope that the bargaining in shops will be like the "truly no bargaining" of transportation agencies.</p>
<p>Also, nowadays, universities and middle schools in Shanghai entrust banks to collect tuition fees, and the bank issues a receipt as a license to attend classes. Thus, rich students and poor students, old and young, are treated equally. As long as the tuition is paid in full, there is no problem. If you can't afford to pay in full, don't even bother to bargain. This spirit of uniformity and no favoritism should be emulated by all merchants, big and small, Chinese and foreign. It would be good to implement commercial education.</p>
<h3>Photo Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>｜New Works of Several Female Portraits｜</p>
<p>A｜On her neck, it seems that a Shatin pomelo is placed. In the depression of her forward-pointing nose, there are sprinkled some things like fine gauze, which extend to the palms on both sides.</p>
<p>B｜The color of Shandong pears is so much more lovely... But her face is exactly shaped like an inverted Shandong pear. The yellow color on her face feels scary, although there is also the application of stiff powder and soft cream. Also, the small yellow-brown spots on the pears can also be found on her yellow face.</p>
<p>C｜I once saw a German breed of excellent dog at a friend's house. Its long black hair was draped over its white-haired face... Its two black and shiny pupils often shot out a pleasant expression, which I found very endearing. Now, meeting her made me relive the demeanor of that German dog... Because she also has a head of black hair, and it is very long, covering her face made white with cosmetics. But her black pupils do not have that kind of pleasantness.</p>
<p>D｜Equilateral triangles are the outline of her face. The most prominent feature is her pair of shaved and painted long eyebrows... The front ends of the eyebrows almost touch each other, and the outer ends almost curl back. If you look at her from a distance, it looks like she is wearing a thin hairband.</p>
<p>E｜Her companions all call her... "Double-bell alarm clock." Her two eyes, half-open and half-closed, resemble the semicircular double bells covering the top of an alarm clock... Her face is also round... And the sound of her speech is as loud as the simultaneous ringing of double bells.</p>
<p>F｜In her childhood, a large sore that reduced her beauty grew on her left cheek, so it became uneven fleshy warts, very much like a washed, white, round yam. However, her pair of eyes still has captivating authority, if you look at her from the right half.</p>
<h3>Standing on the Front of a Tram for a Ride</h3>
<p>— Cheng Luding</p>
<p>｜Daydreaming｜</p>
<p>Today, I'm standing on the front of a tram for a ride! I imagine, if I were a great man, if I were a capitalist, if it were summer right now, then I would be happy!</p>
<p>However, after all, it is late autumn, and what is blowing on my face is a cold wind. Even though it is an autumn wind, I am still standing on the front of a tram for a ride.</p>
<p>Standing on the front of a tram for a ride, although not beautiful, and seemingly a ridiculous thing in the eyes of ordinary people, is actually rare and possible. At the very least, it should be a novel ride, right?</p>
<p>I don't know about riding in a car, but whether there is such happiness is still a question. But ultimately, whether there is such a flavor bestowed upon me? Whether there is such scenery accompanying me? Is also a question.</p>
<p>The cold wind blows all over my limbs, the cold wind touches my five senses. Needless to say, the benefits of this ride are definitely more than just this. Even so, it will cause many people to feel elated, and even turn the act of riding into a privilege for the rich.</p>
<p>However, when the piercing autumn wind kisses my face, this is precisely the satisfaction of riding on the front of a tram. It is like being kissed by a modern girl, even if it is, mottled dust, patches of stains, imprinted on my face as a mark of happiness, what difference is there from applying cold cream?</p>
<p>If a shiny car speeds by in front, a cloud of mud and black smoke will fly over from behind. If I am hungry, opening my mouth may also be used as milk and bread. As for scarves and hats, the most practical solution is to ask Mr. Road for help.</p>
<p>In short, it is a joy to ride on the front of a tram. As for mud and sand flying into the eyes to play, as for black smoke flying into the nose to stay temporarily, that goes without saying.</p>
<h3>Short Message</h3>
<p>— Xiangfei</p>
<p>The Great Wall Records, which has been in preparation for a long time, has now decided to release the first batch of products on New Year's Day of the Gregorian calendar. A total of 46 types are all carefully crafted by famous artists from the North and South. Among them, the "Four or Five Flower Caves" is sung jointly by the four famous female performers and is the most valuable. Yu Shuyan has not recorded for a long time, but the Great Wall actually managed to get him to record, which shows its great influence. The first release includes "Catching and Releasing Cao," and "Stopping at an Inn," excerpts from "The Tassel Meeting." His voice is even more vigorous than before. Other examples include Mei Lanfang and Yang Xiaolou's complete "Farewell My Concubine" (a total of twelve sections recorded, the first two, three, and four sections are released first), Cheng Yanqiu and Wang Shaolou's "Fen River Bay" and "Making a Scene at the Kiln," Shang Xiaoyun and Wang Shaolou's "Wujia Slope," etc., are all perfect matches, wonderful products that are unparalleled for a time. It is heard that record distributors in this and other cities have already eagerly ordered goods from the company.</p>
<h3>Crossroads of Death (10)</h3>
<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>The mailroom sent in a stack of letters. Mu Liang was sorting them. The official documents from various agencies and organizations were quite large and extremely boring. Fortunately, there were small letters in pink, lake blue, and violet, some with fragrance, which diluted the blue indigo smell and the red ink smell. He considered himself specially favored, personally delivering the letters to the female comrades' seats one by one, accepting their standing up to thank him one by one. However, when it came to himself, he did not receive a single heartwarming letter, so he couldn't help but feel envious of the letters sent to the male colleagues. Who would bother to personally deliver them? He pressed the buzzer and called in a messenger, ordering him to distribute them. This was a daily routine that arrived on time every day, which made him feel that the first wife and concubines at home were not only not interested, but also annoying.</p>
<p>Ultimately, is it universal love? Or exclusive love? No, before solving the knotty problems at home, one cannot seek other paths to carry out this loving activity. He made up his mind, and in the waning moon of the second month, he took a week's leave and returned to Suzhou.</p>
<p>The first wife first asked him: "Is work tiring? I heard there are brothels in Fishing Lane, have you been there a few times?"</p>
<p>Mu Liang laughed and said: "Madam! You are too out of touch with the times. Under the National Government, is there still room for brothels to exist?"</p>
<p>The first wife looked unconvinced and said: "Can you really ban them completely? Just look at opium. The more it's banned, the more people smoke it."</p>
<p>Mu Liang said: "There are no official brothels anymore, but if you want to play, there are other ways."</p>
<p>"How so?" The first wife showed that she was good at predicting things.</p>
<p>Aigu also came, not knowing if she was afraid or unable? She didn't say a single meaningful word, just said a simple, straightforward, unanswerable question: "Young Master is back?"</p>

<p>Kaicheng Sulfuric Acid Plant started its furnace on National Day. The plant is located in the Yinhang District, Jungong Road, covering an area of about 50 acres. It is connected to the Huangpu River in the east, Jungong Road in the west, and is about three miles away from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant in the north. The buildings in the plant include offices, material warehouses, storage yards, machine repair shops, and chemical laboratories, as well as special factory buildings such as furnace rooms. In addition to the warehouses, lead rooms, and concentration rooms, there is also an arsenic removal room under construction, and a ore crushing room that only has foundations due to damage to the ore crushing machine. Gao Xingruo and Fang Lixi are responsible for the plant design. Currently, the factory area only occupies one-sixth of the total area, and the remaining area is said to be reserved for the construction of a saltpeter and nitric acid plant and the expansion of the sulfuric acid plant. The raw material, pyrite ore, is purchased from Zhuji and Ruian, and hundreds of tons have arrived and are piled up in front of the furnace room, their brilliant light gleaming like a ground covered in gold. It is said that the products are temporarily set at three types: the "bao acid" produced daily in various lead chambers, with a specific gravity of 50 degrees Baume, which is equivalent to about 62% pure sulfuric acid; the concentrated acid with a Baume degree of 66 degrees, which is about 95% pure acid, is concentrated using a concentrating furnace; and the mixed sulfuric acid with a Baume degree of 60 degrees, which contains about 78% pure sulfuric acid. In addition, various components of dilute acid or concentrated acid can be prepared according to the needs of various manufacturers. Currently, sulfuric acid on the market comes from Japan, and only one type of 66 degrees is available. Factories that use dilute acid must add water to dilute it, which is uneconomical and laborious. After Kaicheng ships its products, there will be various commodities on the market, which is very convenient for user factories. In recent years, many new factories have been established in the country, but the Kaicheng factory, which is operated with domestic capital, uses domestic raw materials, and hires domestic technicians to design, is rare. Therefore, the commercial attachés of various countries in China attach great importance to the company, and several have visited the factory. Sulfuric acid is not only extremely related to industry, but also very important to military affairs. It is said that General Chen Gongxia will soon hold a formal furnace opening ceremony for the plant.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Nationalized</h3>
<p>Reorganization Idea from Finance Minister Song</p>
<p>New Candidates Approved by Chiang</p>
<p>Guo Wen She reports: The China Merchants Bureau, the only shipping agency in China, has been decided by the 75th Executive Yuan meeting to be nationalized. All commercial shares will be repurchased by the government, and important figures from the financial world and society will be separately appointed to organize a board of directors and supervisors. Liu Hongsheng has been appointed as the general manager of the bureau. The reorganization principle has been passed by the Central Political Conference yesterday. The information obtained by this agency is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Origin and Process of Reorganization: The bureau was reorganized by government officials in 1929, and since then, its personnel have changed several times. Recently, the supervisor, Chen Fumu, was criticized for his poor reorganization, and the bureau's financial difficulties have reached an extreme point. Those in charge are unable to turn lead into gold, and the debtors are in dire straits. General Manager Li Guojie recently went to Nanjing and Beijing to make suggestions to Chairman Chiang and the new Minister of Communications, Zhu Jiahua, regarding the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau. Chiang and Zhu both sympathized with Li's plan, as the bureau has been living on debt for many years. Therefore, Minister Zhu stated a few days ago that the position of general manager would still be held by Li. However, Finance Minister Song Ziwen, noting that the China Merchants Bureau has not made any progress since the National Government sent officials to reorganize it, and that the amount of debt has increased, believes that the reason is insufficient funds. If the China Merchants Bureau is to be truly effective, it must have a large amount of financial resources to reorganize. This reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau is largely Song's idea.</p>
<p>Chiang and Song Discuss Reorganization Candidates: Finance Minister Song Ziwen invited important figures from the banking and financial sectors to his residence in Shanghai this Monday for a final discussion on the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau (some speculated that Song was borrowing money from the banking and financial sectors, which may have been a misunderstanding). The result was extremely satisfactory. The next morning, he took a plane to Beijing to attend the Executive Yuan meeting and present the reorganization plan, which was approved and forwarded to the Central Political Conference. On the same day, he flew back to Wuhan to present everything to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and submit various plans for nationalization and candidates for the new positions after the reorganization. Chiang expressed that it was feasible to abolish the original position of supervisor and form a board of directors and supervisors, as well as a general manager to preside over the bureau's affairs. Chiang also reviewed this list of candidates and submitted it to the next Central Political Conference for approval and appointment. The investigation conducted by the Guo Wen She reporter yesterday is as follows: Ye Zhuotang, Zhang Shouyong, Shi Liangcai, Zhang Gongquan, Yang Zhixiong, Zhang Xiaolin, Yu Feipeng, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Guangfu, Qian Xinzhi, Hu Bijiang, Li Fuxun, Yu Rizhang, Hu Junzhuang, Sheng Huangyi, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Qin Runqing, Guo Chengen, Huang Jinrong, Rong Zongjing, Jin Tingsun, etc. Liu Hongsheng is the general manager.</p>
<p>Accumulated Surplus May Cause Disputes: Yesterday, the reporter went to the China Merchants Bureau. In addition to the supervisory office preparing to hand over procedures, the general management office was still operating as usual. General Manager Li Guojie also came to the office to work. Then he went downstairs to the Accumulated Surplus Company. According to reports, the company only saw in the newspapers that the government would include all shares and assets of the Accumulated Surplus Company in this principle. The company was not willing to agree. According to another source, the nationalization of the China Merchants Bureau may cause disputes due to the issue of shares of the Accumulated Surplus Company.</p>
<p>Statement of the New General Manager: According to Liu Hongsheng yesterday, he stated that the Executive Yuan meeting had decided to nationalize the bureau and form a board of directors and supervisors, and appointed him as the general manager. He said that in recent years, he has felt very sad about China's shipping industry. The China Merchants Bureau has always had an unclear nature, with issues such as state-owned commercial, commercial-owned commercial, and commercial-owned government-supervised. Now that the government has decided to nationalize it and prepare to repurchase commercial shares, the issue of its nature should be resolved. He said that he has not yet received an order and cannot express his views.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Held Winter Defense Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cooperative Defense to Begin on the 16th</p>
<p>Three Defense Zones Each with a Commander</p>
<p>Due to the post-war depression and increasing unemployment in the city, the risk of desperate acts is high during the winter season. Therefore, the municipal public security authorities are taking winter defense more seriously this year than in previous years. Wen Hongen of the Public Security Bureau held a defense meeting at the bureau at 9 a.m. yesterday. Attendees included secretaries, section chiefs, chief inspectors, investigation team leaders, police detachment leaders, district chiefs, precinct chiefs, and heads of fire brigades and security corps from various sections of the Shanghai South area, totaling more than 60 people.

<h3>Beixin Bookstore Case</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Has Received Instructions</p>
<p>Will Execute with the Court</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan has instructed the Municipal Government to seal up the Beixin Bookstore with the court in the case of the Beixin Bookstore insulting Islam. The representatives of the Shanghai Muslims who petitioned in Beijing also returned to Shanghai yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Representatives Return to Shanghai: The Shanghai Muslims previously sent Da Pusheng, Mu Huating, Wu Yongxia, Ma Xingdong and other four representatives to petition in Beijing. Except for Ma Xingdong, who had returned to Shanghai earlier to report, the other three representatives took a night train back to Shanghai only after receiving the reply from the Executive Yuan the day before yesterday. They arrived at the North Station at about 8 a.m. yesterday. More than 800 Shanghai Muslims went to the North Station to welcome them. The three representatives got off the train amidst the cheers of the various religious friends and changed to cars and drove straight to the Islamic Association in Qinglian Alley, Fangbang Bridge. Representative Da Pusheng reported on the situation of the petition in Beijing. All the Muslims expressed satisfaction and applauded.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Petition: The Shanghai Muslims elected Ha Shaofu, Da Pusheng, Mu Huating, Wu Yongxia, Sha Peng, Wang Yi and other six people as representatives to carry the reply from the Executive Yuan to the Municipal Government to petition at 10:30 a.m. They requested the Municipal Government to reply to the documents submitted by the heads of the Shanghai Islamic mosques to the Municipal Government as soon as possible and to execute the orders of the Executive Yuan immediately. The Mayor sent Secretary-General Yu to receive them as representatives. First, Ha Shaofu stated the purpose of the petition and presented the reply from the Executive Yuan. Secretary-General Yu expressed his acceptance of the representatives' requests and said that the Municipal Government has received the instructions from the Executive Yuan and will execute them as soon as possible. The representatives expressed their satisfaction and left.</p>
<p>Political Yuan's Reply: The Executive Yuan previously replied to the documents submitted by the heads of the Shanghai Islamic mosques, saying that the book "Little Pig Bajie" published by Beixin Bookstore deliberately spread insults to Islam and should be sealed up immediately, and the publisher, editor and author should be prosecuted according to law, and the Shanghai Municipal Government should be ordered to comply.</p>
<p>Mayor's Talk: The Central News Agency reporter visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government yesterday to inquire about the handling of the Beixin Bookstore's insult to Islam case. According to Mayor Wu, the Municipal Government received instructions from the Executive Yuan this morning (that is, yesterday morning) to seal up the Beixin Bookstore with the court. The Municipal Government will naturally comply with the order and will now send a letter to the First Special District Court to order the police to execute the sealing.</p>
<p>Book Industry's Statement: The Shanghai Book Industry Association held an executive committee meeting at 10 a.m. yesterday to discuss the "Little Pig Bajie" case. More than ten executive committee members from Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, World Book Company, Datong Book Company, Guangyi Book Company, etc. attended the meeting. Li Zhiyun, the manager of Beixin Bookstore, also attended the meeting. It was decided that: (1) A request will be submitted to the central government and the municipal government to handle the "Little Pig Bajie" case fairly in accordance with the law; (2) Beixin Bookstore will be ordered to publish an apology to all Muslims again. The telegrams to the central government and the municipal government were sent yesterday afternoon. Beixin Bookstore has also complied with the order to publish an apology in various newspapers today. The original text reads: "Our bookstore published a collection of folk tales, including a book called "Little Pig Bajie". It mistakenly included Zhu Yangshan's manuscript, "Little Pig Bajie," which was not carefully reviewed. We have repeatedly expressed our apologies to the Muslims. Now, in accordance with the resolution of the Book Industry Association, we formally apologize to all Muslim gentlemen and earnestly hope that you will understand."</p>
<h3>Arch-Criminal in Major Assassination Case Arrested</h3>
<p>Previously Threw Bombs at Residences of Wang Jingwei and Song Ziwen</p>
<p>Tang Youlu Was Indeed Murdered by Him</p>
<p>Hired to Assassinate Lytton</p>
<p>Not Hesitating to Cause an International Dispute</p>
<p>The League of Nations Investigation Team, which came to China to investigate the Manchurian Incident, passed through Shanghai in March. At that time, the war of aggression against Shanghai by the Japanese army had temporarily ceased due to the retreat of our 19th Route Army to the second line of defense. Lord Lytton and other members of the team were also tasked by the League of Nations to investigate the Shanghai Incident nearby, so they stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund to conduct their investigation. Unexpectedly, at this time, some conspirators attempted to cause a major international incident to frame our country. They spared no expense in recruiting traitors and mercenaries to organize an assassination organization, and their followers</p>
<p>were hiding inside the Cathay Hotel, originally planning to throw grenades from the window when key members of the team entered or left the hotel, in order to harm the members. Fortunately, our government and the concession police provided thorough protection, and the plot of these people had no chance to succeed. This kind of conspiracy was not exposed until the 26th of last month, when Chief Inspector You A'gen and Detective Zhou Guisheng of the Lao Zha Police Station arrested 23 people, including Long Lin, in the French Concession, who were heavily implicated in the case of Lu Ziqing, who was kidnapped by bandits on Kunming Road on September 24 and killed on the spot when the kidnapping failed. It was then discovered that these bandits were indeed the arch-criminals in this unprecedented assassination case, and that the bombs thrown at the French Concession residences of the Premier</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei and Song Ziwen were also done by these people. Subsequently, the police lawyer Chen Ming petitioned the First Special District Court to postpone the public prosecution until the investigation was completed, which was approved, and the suspects were detained for interrogation. It is now known that Premier Song Ziwen, accompanied by his secretary Tang Youlu, went to the North Railway Station to take a train to the capital last autumn. When they were about to board the train, a bandit suddenly opened fire, killing Mr. Tang with a bullet. The murderer fled the scene immediately. It has now been found that this was also done by Long and his gang. He also gathered his gang on a certain day to go to the municipal government, intending to take the opportunity</p>
<p>to harm Mayor Wu Tiecheng. As for the cases committed by these people in the concession, which were prosecuted by the Public Works Department to the First Special Court, they include: (1) The defendants Long Lin and Tang Ming, from March 20 to 22, carried three grenades and two pistols in the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, plotting to kill Gu Weijun, Song Ziwen, Wu Tiecheng, and Luo Wengan, committing the crime under Article 284, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. (2) The defendants Long and Tang, at the same time and place, carried guns and ammunition with five accomplices at large, committing the crime of endangering public safety under Article 200, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and violating Article 1 of the Gun Control Ordinance promulgated by the National Government in October 1928. (3) The defendant Long Lin, on July 25 last year, gathered a gang at 521 Yuqing Lane, Nanjing Road, to rob Gu Keming of</p>
<p>a total of 16,000 yuan in cash. (4) The defendants Tang Ming and Ma Yijin, on October 2, gathered a gang and broke into 922 Edward Road to rob Zhou Dewen of property worth 258 yuan. (5) The defendants Tang and Ma, on September 22, threatened Cui Xianting at 3 Fuqing Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, with pistols. (6) The defendant Tang Ming sent a threatening letter to He Haiqing on March 19, attempting to defraud him of 400 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Chief Detective You, who was handling the case, led</p>
<p>Long Lin, Ma Yijin, Tang Ming, Ma Yinhe, Tian Zemin, Weng Xinwu, Chen Chunting, Li Yuncheng, Zhang Chun, Chen Jiesan, He Yinshan, Wan Jiayun, Liu Hanqing, Qin Tianyou, Xiang Ziyun, Xu Hongyuan, Wang Yunqiao, Su Zhian, Wang Bolin, Yu Minghai, Li Zhongfa, Feng Guoqi, and Xiong Zicheng, and others, a total of 23 people, as well as the</p>
<p>one grenade, one pistol, and nine bullets seized, and brought them to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court, where Judge Qian Hongye took the bench for interrogation. Zhan Jifeng, legal advisor specially appointed by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, appeared in court to request the transfer of the case. According to lawyer Zhan, there are two reasons for transferring the defendants: (1) The defendants Long Lin and others have been taken to the police station by the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. According to their confession, their sole purpose is to assassinate the highest government officials. Although they all live in the concession, the places where they commit their crimes are in the Chinese territory, such as the attempted assassination of Minister Song at the North Railway Station last year, which resulted in the accidental</p>
<p>killing of Secretary Tang Youlu, and the offense of the defendant Tang Ming waiting near the municipal government to assassinate Mayor Wu. All of these crimes were committed in the Chinese territory, and according to the law, they should be handled by the government agency where the incident occurred without any doubt. (2) If this case is handled by your court, it would not be inappropriate. However, according to the agreement, the investigation procedures of your court should be carried out by the police station, and the only task of the police station is to protect the safety and stability of the concession. It is understandable that they do not have an in-depth study of cases involving political disturbances or having a background, and they are not familiar with such cases. Moreover, the defendants only live in the concession without a fixed address, and</p>
<p>they are not ordinary robbers or murderers. They have absolutely no connection with the security of the concession. Therefore, in order to facilitate the investigation, it should be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for investigation so that the legal facts can be more thoroughly investigated. The police lawyer Gan Jingxian agreed with the Municipal Public Security Bureau's request for transfer and said that this case has political implications and should be handled by the Public Security Bureau. Although the Second Special District Court also sent a letter requesting the transfer, he requested the court to reply to that court and ask them to transfer the case to the Public Security Bureau separately. Judge Qian then approved the request of the lawyer of the Public Security Bureau and ordered that Long Lin and other 23 people be taken away by the personnel of the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Righteous Army Report on the War Situation</h3>
<p>Urgently Hoping for Assistance from Compatriots</p>
<p>The representative office in Shanghai of Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Army of Jilin, sent a letter to the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association and the Overseas Chinese Federation yesterday, saying (the above is omitted): Recently, Zhao Decheng, a secret investigator sent to the front line, returned to Beiping and reported that he was dispatched from Beiping on September 24 and arrived in Harbin on the 29th. The inspection along the way was extremely strict.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>On October 7, he arrived at Shangchengzi, that is, Xingyuan Town in Muling County. Because the rear staff preparation office of the National Salvation Army was stationed there, he first went to see Staff Officer Zhao Li to investigate the military situation and learned a rough idea, and also inquired that Commander-in-Chief Wang Delin was stationed in Dongning, guarding the fortress. He then took the road forward and arrived at the county seat on the 11th, where he met Commander-in-Chief Wang to report in detail the indignation of the people in Guannei, and also talked about everything with Cao Puquan, Secretary-General of the Headquarters, Staff Officer Jia Dequan, and Adjutant Cao Huating. Since the September 18th Incident, our army has vowed to resist to the death and has won every battle. In total, we have fought more than eighty battles of all sizes. All the cities and towns occupied have been immediately handed over to the Self-Defense Army for management after their recovery. Our army spends its nights in the open air and eats in the wind in remote mountains, specializing in attacking and never asking about taxation. Currently, we are gathering all our strength to capture Jilin Province, but the enemy's supplies are sufficient and their weapons are strong. In addition, with air cover, it is extremely difficult for us to succeed. We have already seriously surrounded it, and the complete recovery of the provincial capital is just around the corner, and there is no fear of failure. We have not relaxed our plans to disrupt the railways. Earlier, the Japanese army sent troops to protect the railway and transport lumberjacks to repair the Jidun line for the purpose of a long-term invasion. After our side detected this, we took the lead and Wu Yicheng led troops to intercept the enemy army. After a long battle, we finally defeated the Japanese railway protection army, killing hundreds of enemies and seizing countless supplies of gunpowder, such as machine guns, mortars, and large-caliber guns, as well as bullets. Our army suffered fifty or sixty casualties, and the enemy suffered about two hundred casualties. On the evening of the 14th, our 16th Regiment ambushed the invaders at Baligang, eight miles east of Hengdaohezi, causing the train to derail. The Japanese slaves fled in droves, killing two enemy officers and eight soldiers on the spot, and wounding twelve. Our side also suffered three deaths and six injuries. At that time, our Deputy Commander Kong Xianrong was planning to attack Ning'an County, and the situation was critical. It happened that a large number of gasoline and lumber vehicles were speeding west from the Shala River Station. Deputy Commander Kong heard the news and immediately sent a team to fire missiles, causing the gasoline to ignite and spread to all the enemy's forces. The sound of the explosion was like thunder, and the red flames covered the sky. All the violent Japanese vehicles were reduced to ashes. After suffering this heavy blow, the enemy's railway tracks were completely destroyed, and the rear support became more and more delayed. In the battle of Ning'an, our army killed more than two hundred enemy soldiers. In just half a month, we successively recovered Ning'an County, Tokyo Town, and Hailin Station. The markets and businesses were operating as usual, the schools were reading, the neighborhoods were peaceful, and the soldiers were rejoicing. There were originally three flour mills in Ning'an, two of which were burned down by our army, leaving only the Zengxing Flour Mill to replenish our army's military rations and flour. Although there are scattered Japanese troops hiding near the city, the number is small and it is not difficult to eliminate them with a thorough search. The retreating army has fled in two directions, one retreating to Hailin Station and the other fleeing to the West Mountain. As for ammunition, Commander Wang's arsenal has two hundred workers who manufacture various guns, cannons, and bullets. All are extremely useful. Various empty shell casings are transported back from the front line for reloading and re-sent to the front line for secondary bombardment, which saves time and speed. The clothing factory has fifty workers, but it has not been able to expand its operations due to financial constraints. Opium is also purchased from the factory in a roundabout way, and the procedures are complicated. How can a large amount of medicinal materials be prepared from Guannei so that they can be manufactured continuously? This is what Commander Wang urgently hopes to report to the authorities for attention. The clothing is one item. Because the war zone of our army is located in the extreme border, the weather in the severe winter is colder than elsewhere, and there is already snow and ice on the road. During the recent attack on Ning'an, many soldiers still went into battle wearing only single-layer clothing, and their skin was chapped, which is extremely worrying. In addition, Commander Wang is determined not to disturb the people and merchants, and takes the people as the oath of the army, which is indeed very different from other armies that can raise money on the spot to plan for a full stomach. This is also what the people of Northeast China have seen and heard together. If 70,000 armed comrades are trapped in the icy and snowy land and we do not urgently appeal to all parties for special maintenance and prompt allocation of funds for cotton-padded clothes, trousers, and leather hats, it will be difficult to achieve the final success. This is what Commander Wang urgently hopes to report to the authorities for attention. Secondly, when Decheng was about to leave, the Japanese had not yet completed the Mudanjiang Bridge. Commander Wang plans to weigh the pros and cons after it is completed and then carry out a fierce attack or occupation. At that time, there will be a detailed report, etc.</p>
<p>The communication office received a telegram from the front line yesterday, saying that Kim Soo-san (Korean), the commander of the First Detached Force of the Special Operations Unit, is currently stationed near Dagushan, Dali Jiabaozi. The puppet commander Li Baoshan led 1,500 water police to surrender, bringing countless supplies and bullets, and killed the deputy commander Zhang Zongnan (Japanese) to prove his sincerity.</p>
<p>In Liaoning, Wang Zhenzhong, Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route Army of the Northeast National Salvation Army, and Wang Jingmin, political special envoy of the Second Independent Detachment, came to Shanghai from Tianjin the day before yesterday to request assistance from the rear. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specially visited their residence yesterday and was received. When asked about the recent situation of the army, they said that since Zhu Jiqing left the customs this spring to advocate the formation of the Northeast National Salvation Army, the people in various places have risen up to respond and the momentum has grown. They have fought with the Japanese army many times and have achieved considerable victories, but due to insufficient materials, they have not been able to make full progress. At present, our military strength in the western and southern parts of Liaoning has reached more than 160,000 people, distributed in more than 40 counties. The area around Liaozhong is all an area where the National Salvation Army is active. In the summer, there were more infantry due to the green gauze tent, but now most of them have been formed into cavalry after the autumn. Currently, there are more cavalry than infantry. As for the progress of the war, the main battlefield in western Liaoning is in Yi County and Jinzhou, because these two places cooperate well in combat, can retreat and defend, and can cut off the puppet Fengshan Road so that the Japanese army cannot take care of both ends. Therefore, Zhu Jiqing is supervising the battle here. On June 18, Yixian City was captured by the Meng Zhaoyan and other troops. Recently, Daling River, Yangquanzi, and Shishan Station were captured by the Zhang Wuming and other troops. As for the attack on Jinzhou, it is being planned and will be completed soon. In short, the focus of western Liaoning is on the development of the puppet Fengshan Road. In southern Liaoning, since the United Militia drove out the Japanese police and recovered the five districts of Liaoyang, there have been five or six battles, and the following four were the most intense. Our army has won many times and captured many prisoners and weapons. Recently, the National Salvation Army recovered Dafanggou in the five districts of Haicheng, and the momentum at the front is even greater. Soon, it is also planned to attack Liaoyang in preparation for developing on the Anfeng Line. The suffering of life in the army is well known to compatriots across the country. The current needs are that no matter how willing the soldiers fighting are to sacrifice and endure hardship, the various difficulties in clothing, food, ammunition, and weapons will make it very dangerous to last long. Although Zhu Jiqing has been working hard to provide relief, the actual amount obtained by Zhu must be divided among the 160,000 troops. The various troops of the Northeast National Salvation Army are well aware of this situation. In addition, Zhu's personal hard work and diligence, leading by example, can especially move the soldiers. What is urgently needed at the front now is ammunition, cotton clothing, tents, and gas masks, because winter is the most difficult time, and it is also the most opportune time for the Japanese to increase their pursuit. If we want to resist for a long time and recover lost territory, compatriots at home and abroad must provide the Northeast armies with all kinds of practical assistance urgently, so that the front has enough ammunition, warm clothes, and full stomachs, so that the spirit of the soldiers in each unit can be united and the military strength of each unit can be used to recover the lost territory of the Northeast, which is the greatest blessing for our motherland.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ming Sends Telegram to Congratulate Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Ming and the newly elected President Roosevelt of the United States were classmates in the United States and have a very deep relationship. He hopes that Roosevelt will support the Chinese government's diplomacy and resolve all difficult issues as soon as possible after taking office, and wishes the United States prosperity.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Central Supervisory Committee Members Support Zheng Jicheng</h3>
<p>Telegraphic Request for Special Amnesty from the Central Government</p>
<p>The national public opinion unanimously supports Zheng Jicheng in the assassination of Zhang Zongchang, and telegrams from all parties requesting special amnesty from the Central Government have been pouring in like snowflakes, as repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Recently, more than a dozen members of the Shanghai Central Supervisory Committee, including Sun Ke, Cheng Qian, and Li Liejun, also sent a telegram to the Central Government to pardon Zheng. The original telegram is recorded below: Nanjing Central Political Conference, National Government, Zheng Jicheng, compelled by righteous indignation, shot Zhang Zongchang at the station and surrendered calmly, both avenging the public and respecting the national law. His filial piety and righteousness are commendable, and the facts are worthy of sympathy. The Book of Songs says that filial sons will not be lacking and will always be blessed. The reason why national public opinion is unanimously supporting him is that there is a reason for this. We should ask your government to issue a clear order to grant Zheng Jicheng a special amnesty to show compassion. We respectfully submit this telegram and humbly request your inspection and verification. Sun Ke, Cheng Qian, Bai Wenwei, Tan Zhen, Chen Jiayou, Li Liejun, Ma Chaojun, Chen Ce, Zhang Huichang, Xiong Kewu, Zhang Dingfan, Liang Hancao, Yang Shukan, Wen Zhenwu, Zhang Zhiben, Liu Luyin, Huang Jilu, Sun Jingya, Gui Chongji, Fu Rulin, Jiao Yitang, Xue Dubi, Kou Geng</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Transferred Back Home</h3>
<p>Pay Attention to Sugisaka's Instructions</p>
<p>Commander's Instructions The Shanghai Japanese Naval Landing Force was transferred from Sasebo with 625 new soldiers, of which 240 were assigned to various ships on the Yangtze River, and the remainder were assigned to the Landing Force to supplement the 300 naval personnel who were to be transferred back to Japan. Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., they were gathered in the headquarters by Rear Admiral Sugisaka, commander of the Landing Force, to give instructions.</p>
<p>Boarding the Ship to Leave Shanghai After Sugisaka finished his instructions, all the Landing Force soldiers went to the Osaka Wharf to board the special service ship Todoh Maru, which is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 6:00 a.m. this morning via Wusong and return directly to the Sasebo Naval Base in Japan. Yesterday, many Japanese expatriates in Shanghai went to Yangshupu to see off the army returning home. Commander Sugisaka, Chief of Staff Kajishima, and others also went to the pier to see them off.</p>
<p>Izumo Moves Berth Lieutenant General Sakonji, Commander of the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy, has now received orders to be promoted to Commander of the Sasebo Naval Port, and Lieutenant General Takahashi will succeed him as Commander of the Third Fleet. Sakonji is preparing to hand over his duties and will leave for home as soon as the new commander arrives. The flagship Izumo of the Third Fleet, which was originally moored at the Nikko Wharf near the Waitanyuan Bridge, moved to the Jiangmian No. 7 and No. 8 river piers in Yangshupu at noon yesterday because the naval soldiers in the ship were being replaced by new ones, so it was moved there to facilitate the boarding and alighting of the soldiers.</p>
<h3>Englishman Webb to Fly Home from Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that Englishman Webb bought an airplane at an auction house in Shanghai yesterday. If it can be used for long-distance flights after a test flight and is permitted by the government, he plans to fly back to his country in three or four weeks. Webb served in the British Air Force for two years after the European War, and then tried planting rubber trees in the Malay Peninsula for several years. He came to China two years ago and recently operated shipping in the Songhua River, but was squeezed out by the Japanese. He then came south to Shanghai. A few days ago, he happened to see two German-made biplanes for sale in the auction advertisement column in the newspaper, so he bought one for 750 yuan yesterday. The other one was bought by a Chinese aviator for 250 taels. After purchasing the plane, Webb decided to fly back to his country and applied to the government for permission to depart from Hongqiao Airport and reach Hong Kong via Fuzhou and Xiamen. After arriving in Hong Kong, he plans to take the route through Singapore, India, and Egypt to return to England. The aircraft is a Schwalbe two-seater model equipped with a 120-horsepower Siemens engine. It was shipped to Hong Kong four years ago by a certain company, which originally planned to sell it to the government. However, due to the company's liquidation, it was put up for auction, so the aircraft has not been used.</p>

<h3>News from the Inspection Group of Disaster Areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Depart on the 20th</p>
<p>Twenty People in Each Province</p>
<p>The three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei have long suffered from the ravages of bandits and communists. Since June of this year, the Central Government ordered a general suppression, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally went to Hubei Province to supervise the military operations. Now the military has achieved successive victories, and the bandit areas have been gradually recovered. However, the people are displaced, and the fields and houses are in ruins. The disaster situation is dire and the famine is worrying. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, deeply saddened, specifically telegraphed Mr. Wang Xiaolai to Wuhan, and also telegraphed Mayor Wu and leaders from all walks of life to find ways to provide relief and welcome the organization of an inspection group to go to the three provinces to inspect and understand the true situation of the disaster. Mayor Wu and others specially hosted a banquet for leaders from all walks of life at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the evening of the 5th to discuss relief measures. An ad hoc Joint Relief Association for the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei was established on the spot. Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Wen Lanting, Zhao Jinqing, Liu Zhanen, Huang Hanzhi, Ye Gongchuo, Yu Xiji, Pan Gongzhan, and other nine people were appointed as preparatory committee members for the inspection group of the three provinces. A committee was set up in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to welcome various Shanghai organizations and the press to participate in the inspection. According to Mayor Wu's words to the Central News Agency reporter yesterday, the inspection group of disaster areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei has been scheduled to depart on the 20th of this month, with a stipulation of twenty people in each province. All round-trip expenses will be borne by the inspectors themselves. However, the respective provincial governments will be responsible for the protection and reception after arriving in the disaster areas.</p>
<h3>The Post-Disaster Relief Society for the Jiangwan Disaster Area Decides on Three Measures</h3>
<p>This spring, the villages in the Jiangwan area suffered tremendous disasters during the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. The fields and village houses were almost completely burned down. After the end of the war, many civilians were left homeless. The Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association had successively donated huge sums of money, designating various districts to build memorial villages for the displaced people to live in. The Jiangwan area received 60,000 yuan, and the Municipal Committee of the district planned to build four memorial villages. One village at Gaojing Temple has already been completed, but the villagers are petitioning the Municipal Council because they are not suited to living together due to farming. This is about to cause trouble. In view of this, all parties are urgently planning post-disaster measures to remedy the situation. It was learned yesterday that the Relief Group of the Shanghai War Zone Rehabilitation Committee specially convened a meeting to discuss this matter and decided on three measures on the spot: ㈠ Please transfer the remaining 21,000 yuan of relief funds allocated to the Jiangwan area by the former Local Maintenance Association to relief funds; ㈡ The 15,000 yuan housing loan that the War Zone Rehabilitation Committee should allocate to the Jiangwan area will be allocated as soon as possible; ㈢ The War Zone Rehabilitation Committee will send a letter to the Songhu War Zone Rehabilitation Committee to continue to allocate 100,000 yuan of the second phase of relief funds, which will be submitted by the Social Affairs Bureau to the Municipal Government for review. If the Municipal Government deems it feasible, it will be handled accordingly.</p>
<h3>The Shandong Association Cables to Request Not to Deploy Large Troops to Shandong</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shandong Association sent a cable to the military authorities, saying: To Commander Chiang in Hankou, Acting Commander Zhang in Peiping, and Minister He in Nanjing: Upon investigation, the conflict between Han and Liu in Jiaodong has suddenly spanned a month, and the local area is in a state of devastation and misery that is difficult to describe. I have recently seen reports that you have repeatedly ordered a ceasefire, with each side returning to its own defense and that various measures, including the transfer of Liu away from Shandong, are about to be implemented step by step. In this way, the scourge of war will cease and the disputes will be resolved. It can be seen that you are concerned about the national crisis and care about the people. The people of Shandong are overjoyed. However, Jiaodong is located in a strategic location, with neighbors surrounding it to the east. If a gap appears, they will immediately take advantage of it. In order to punish the past and prevent future troubles, after Liu's army leaves Shandong, it is hoped that large troops will not be deployed. Internally, this will avoid conflicts of authority; externally, there will be no grounds for slander. The people's plight will be alleviated and the supply will be slightly restored. This is a natural cause and effect. Therefore, I dare to cable a request to comply with public opinion and not station large troops in the Jiaodong area in the future to avoid disputes and alleviate the people's suffering. The situation is extremely urgent and awaits orders. The Shandong Association in Shanghai bows respectfully.</p>

<h3>Assassination Case at the Old North Gate Last Night</h3>
<p>A Western-Suited Youth Named Zhang Zhigang</p>
<p>Was Riding a Rickshaw on Yanhai Street</p>
<p>When He Was Shot Three Times and Died on the Spot</p>
<p>At around 8 o'clock last night, a young man of about twenty years old, wearing a Western suit, was riding in a rickshaw near Heng Street, Old North Gate, when suddenly a thug dressed in black shirt and trousers jumped out from the roadside, caught up with the rickshaw, and took out a pistol, firing three shots at the youth in the rickshaw. All three shots hit the youth in the head. The youth fell out of the rickshaw and collapsed on the roadside, bleeding profusely. Passers-by and police officers gathered upon hearing the sound. The youth died on the spot. The police officers immediately reported to the head of the First Sub-station of the Second District by telephone. Upon hearing the news, the head of the sub-station immediately dispatched a patrol officer with armed police officers to round up the suspect, but the murderer had already escaped. The police officers then carefully examined the body of the deceased. They found the three characters "Zhang Zhigang" woven in red velvet inside the lining of the suit coat, and a card in the pocket with "Lu Jinxiang" and "Qinchuan" written on it, followed by "Far East Coal Ball Company Telephone 10669." The patrol officers then took the card and went to the Far East Coal Ball Company to inquire, but the company said that the deceased was not Lu Jinxiang and that they had never heard of Zhang Zhigang. At that time, two five-yuan banknotes and a double-dime silver coin were also found in the deceased's pocket, and there were tattoos on both arms. After half an hour, the First Sub-station of the Second District had completely investigated the deceased's history. The deceased's name was indeed Zhang Zhigang, 29 years old, from Zhenjiang. He had been a gangster in Shanghai for many years and had been sentenced to one year in prison. He had just been released this year. It was also heard that the deceased's wife had come to Shanghai from Zhenjiang the day before yesterday and was staying at the home of a friend, Weng Lao Si. Last night, the deceased also had dinner with his wife at Weng's house before going out alone to visit a friend in the Chinese area of Nanshi. Unexpectedly, he was ambushed by thugs on the way. The body was temporarily placed by the roadside pending an autopsy by the local court today.</p>
<h3>Eighty Pieces of Antiquities from the Tongzhou Museum Recovered</h3>
<p>Original Stolen Goods Found in the Nankang Hotel</p>
<p>Four People Detained, Wang Er Still Needs to be Apprehended</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, the Tongzhou Museum suddenly reported a theft, with a total loss of more than 80 pieces of bronze, porcelain, jade, stone and other antique items, all of which were priceless treasures. The authorities immediately conducted investigations everywhere, but there was no trace. At around 8 o'clock yesterday morning, Guan Qu, the head of the First District of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, suddenly received a secret report that the main culprit and stolen goods had sneaked into Shanghai the day before yesterday. He immediately dispatched patrol officer Guo Jifen to lead police chief Pang Zilin and others to inspect various hotels. When they passed the Nankang Hotel on the Bund of the Sixteenth Wharf, they entered to inspect the guests. Not long after, they checked room number four and saw two beds in the room. A man was sleeping on one bed, and another man and woman were sleeping together on the other bed. None of them got up. They immediately stepped forward and ordered them to get up and questioned their backgrounds. One man claimed to be Chen Jinbiao, and the woman (referring to the female guest) was Ms. Chen Xie, whom he did not know. They had only met on the ship. Since they were just meeting for the first time, why were they sleeping together in the same bed? Suspecting the situation, they immediately detained the two. When questioned further, another man claimed to be Zhou Jinquan, but his words were hesitant and his expression was flustered. They were also detained. Afterwards, they conducted a detailed search of the room and found a huge wooden box under the bed. When they opened it, they saw that it contained the eighty-odd pieces of antiques that had been stolen from the Tongzhou Museum recently. The witnesses were taken back to the district office, and police were stationed in the room to wait for the arrest of the remaining accomplices. As expected, another man named Hu Zixiang came to visit not long after and was detained. After being taken to the district office, the district chief, together with the acting officers, arrested Hu Zixiang and others for preliminary interrogation. Chen Jinbiao confessed that he was 34 years old, from Nantong, and had been engaged in the firecracker business. Zhou Jinquan confessed that he was 47 years old, from Nantong. Hu Zixiang confessed that he was 42 years old and from the same hometown as Chen and Zhou. Regarding the origin of the recovered antiques, they all claimed that a man named Wang Er, whom they knew in Nantong a few days ago, had entrusted them with the wooden box to bring to Shanghai on his behalf. Before leaving, he instructed them to be extra careful with the box along the way because it contained valuable items. In order to avoid attention, they took a boat to Haimen, while Wang Er himself took a boat from Tongzhou to wait in Shanghai, meeting at the Yuebin Hotel in Xiaodongmen. If things were successful, they would each be given 15 yuan. Wang Er lived in the Ximen Head Archway area of Tongzhou and used the alias Yu Yi Wu when he came to Shanghai this time. Unexpectedly, they were arrested by the police this morning after taking a boat from Haimen to Shanghai and staying at the Nankang Hotel. As for the detailed origin of the antiques, they really didn't know, etc. When Ms. Chen Xie was questioned, she confessed that she was 32 years old, from Haimen, and had come to Shanghai from her hometown by boat for important matters. She met Chen and others on the ship. When the ship arrived at the dock last night, it was already late, so Chen and others invited her to stay at the Nankang Hotel. At first, she slept alone in one bed, but Chen suddenly climbed onto her bed in the middle of the night and slept with her under the same quilt. She was caught by the police this morning, but she knew nothing about the antiques, etc. The police were then dispatched to the Yuebin Hotel to arrest Wang Er, but he could not be found. A document was prepared to hand over the four men and women, together with the evidence, to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Employees of the Washeng Electric Factory Donate Salaries to Help the Righteous Army</h3>
<p>All the employees of the Shanghai Washeng Electric Manufacturing Factory have launched a campaign to donate their salaries to help the Northeast Righteous Army. The method is that all employees, from managers to coolies, more than 100 people, donate one day's salary per month, estimated to be more than 300 yuan per month. The donation will start this month and continue until the lost territories of the Northeast are recovered. The funds are intended to be entrusted to a reliable organization for remittance.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Finance Approve the Measures for Surveying and Reporting Disaster Losses</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government previously drafted a plan for surveying and reporting disaster losses in this city and consulted the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Internal Affairs for review. The two ministries have now formally approved it and are specially recording it as follows: ㈠ The survey and reporting of disaster losses in each district of this city shall be handled in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the ministry in addition to the provisions of these measures. ㈡ Disaster losses as referred to in these measures include waterlogging, drought, wind, hail, insect damage and other disasters, as well as any tax reductions due to various disasters. ㈢ In the event of a disaster loss in each district, the municipal councilor of the district shall report it to the Social Affairs Bureau within the prescribed time limit. ㈣ The reporting date for the aforementioned disaster, except for those caused by sudden and rapid changes, shall be limited to the day before the Beginning of Autumn for summer disasters and the day before the Beginning of Winter for autumn disasters. ㈤ After receiving the report from the municipal councilor on the disaster situation in the district, the Social Affairs Bureau shall immediately notify the Finance Bureau and the Land Bureau to send personnel to conduct a joint survey to determine the extent of the disaster. ㈥ The extent of the disaster is classified as follows: Grade A is for damages of 60% or more, Grade B is for damages of 50% or more, and Grade C is for damages of less than 50%. Grade A shall be exempted from 30% to 50% of the tax, Grade B shall be exempted from 10% to 25% of the field tax, and Grade C shall be exempted from 0.5% to 10% of the field tax. ㈦ The above reduction in tax points shall be determined jointly by the Social Affairs, Finance and Land Bureaus depending on the severity of the disaster. ㈧ The Land Bureau shall prepare a register of the disaster-stricken fields and the number of tax extinctions in accordance with the determined tax reduction points, and shall, together with the Finance and Social Affairs Bureaus, verify and add seals to three copies and submit them to the Municipal Government for review and transfer to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Finance for submission and approval. ㈨ Regardless of political tax, surtax, municipal expenses and handling fees, the exemption of field tax must be uniformly exempted according to the exempted points. ㈩ The remaining field tax after exemption will no longer be collected on a yearly basis, but will still be levied in the current year. If the levy is made before the disaster is approved and the exemption cannot be made, it may be offset in the following year. ㈩㈠ If there are any matters not covered by these measures, the Ministry may be consulted for amendment at any time. ㈩㈡ These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation by the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>New Plan for the General Radio Station</h3>
<p>The renovation project of the Central Receiving and Transmitting Room of the Shanghai General Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications on Minquan Road has been completed. A belt conveyor is installed next to the report machine. All telegrams sent from other places are received by the station and placed on this belt, which can be transmitted and delivered by the report messenger in an instant. In the past, the telegrams submitted by local merchants to the station were sent from the bottom floor to the fourth floor by manpower. Now, light-weight reporting pipes are used for pneumatic wheel delivery, which only takes a few seconds. The old manpower transmission methods often resulted in accumulation or errors, all of which can be avoided and are extremely fast. As a result, the business aspect has developed very well. Recently, the station has been actively carrying out a new general station plan in order to concentrate all the transmitting stations in one place for easy management. The plan will be realized soon.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the senders, the station has complied with the requests of various circles, and all the fourth receiving and sending branches in the Shanghai Bank Branch on Minquan Road (the general receiving and sending office east of the Old North Gate Tram Station) and the Xiaodongmen Dongmen Road, and the second receiving and sending branch in the Shanghai Bank Branch in Hongkou, now all receive and send Hong Kong telegrams. Senders can submit them nearby without having to travel far, so they are all called convenient. Moreover, all the sub-receiving and sending offices and the general station use telegram machines to transmit telegrams, so it is even faster.</p>
<h3>The Housing Association's Proposals on Water Prices</h3>
<p>Adopting Both Fundamental and Transitional Solutions</p>
<p>Since the water prices in the Public Concession were calculated based on the meter readings, they have exceeded the original prices by as much as ten times. Therefore, the Housing Association has repeatedly protested and refused to pay. Now, someone has stepped in to mediate, and representatives from the Public Works Department, the Water Company, and the Housing Association are negotiating to find a solution. It is heard that both the Housing Association and the Water Company have submitted written statements. The following is a survey of the Housing Association's proposals on water prices: ㈠ Fundamental Solutions: (A) Convert the Water Company's capital to a silver standard and hire Chinese and foreign experts to re-estimate it. In the future, the interest rate will also be based on the silver standard. (B) Water is a necessity of life, and the Water Company has exclusive rights, which is different from ordinary businesses. In addition to the interest rate, no dividends should be distributed. (C) Each user should have a water meter installed, and the installation cost should be borne by the company. (D) In the future, the water bill should be collected directly from the user by the company. The landlord should deduct 7.5% from the rent. (E) Water prices should be stipulated separately according to the user's level, with first-class Western-style houses being the highest, and so on, with fifth-class Chinese-style houses being the lowest. The minimum standard should not exceed the current water bill calculated based on the rent. (F) The above-mentioned tiered water prices should be fairly stipulated by experts from the Public Works Department, the Water Company, and the Association. (G) The contract signed by the Public Works Department and the Water Company in 1992 and the recent meter installation contract are now obviously not applicable and should be amended separately based on the facts. ㈡ Transitional Solutions: (A) Before the various fundamental solutions are completed, the water bill will still be calculated based on 7.5% of the rent. If the exchange rate reaches two shillings, it will be re-evaluated. (B) Before the various fundamental solutions are completed, the water bill will still be collected and remitted by the owners. (C) The duration of this transitional solution should be at least two years so that residents can thoroughly understand.</p>
<h3>The Taxpayers' Association Again Asks the Public Works Department to Reconsider the Telephone Price Increase Case</h3>
<p>Social Decline Is Not Compatible With Economic Conditions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association yesterday sent a letter to the General Manager of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, saying: Dear Sir, According to the letter from accountant Bei Zuyi, the telephone is a public utility, and its price rate should be determined according to the social and economic conditions. It goes without saying. Now, the Shanghai Telephone Company disregards everything and rashly increases the price, causing criticism from the public. The company is still stubbornly doing so without any awareness. What is even more strange is that the Public Works Department was negligent in considering the proposal to allow the price increase beforehand and lightly passed it. Afterwards, it did not know how to repent and had no sincerity to remedy it. It is deeply regrettable. Reading a letter from Mr. An Sheng to the General Manager of the Bureau published in the Public Works Department Gazette further proves the Bureau's negligence. Mr. An Sheng's proposal to increase the telephone price rate was based on the social and economic conditions at that time in 1929. If there were no obstacles at that time, it would have been implemented with all efforts. Since the proposal was not immediately implemented at that time, the proposal has lost its timeliness and must be reconsidered before a plan can be determined. Moreover, after a delay of three years and a great economic panic, how can the old case be re-proposed and rashly passed? The undersigned believes that the current telephone price increase is not in line with the current social and economic situation. Regardless of whether the telephone company's service can be satisfactory, there is indeed a need to increase the price rate. In short, the Public Works Department's only knowing the interests of the telephone company and disregarding the suitability of the social economy is indeed a cause for suspicion for the undersigned. As the representative of the Chinese taxpayers, the Association cannot ignore the taxpayers and allow the Public Works Department to act hastily, affecting all taxpayers in Shanghai. It is earnestly requested that effective methods be used to fight for a reconsideration of the telephone price rate from the Public Works Department to obtain a fair method that takes into account both parties. This plan must be reviewed by your Association and deemed suitable for the current social and economic situation before it can be implemented. For the sake of social and economic stability and the love of the Public Works Department and the telephone company, the undersigned has to speak his mind. Therefore, a letter is specially sent for your reference and reasonable efforts. The goal will not be achieved and the society will be fortunate. The Association checked that the telephone price increase is not in line with the economic conditions of social decline after the Japanese army disturbed Shanghai. It has repeatedly sent letters to your General Council requesting the Board of Directors to reconsider the case. Now, according to the previous situation, another letter is sent for your reference and joint handling.</p>
<h3>The Responsibility of Customs Officials for Illegal and Derelict Conduct</h3>
<p>Various Trade Associations Sent a Letter to Customs Commissioner Luo</p>
<p>Punishment and Dismissal Should Be Given for Illegal Practices That Harm Merchants</p>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Industry, Sugar Industry, Woolen Cloth Industry, New Medicine Industry, Silk Industry, Ash Industry, Intestine Industry, and other trade associations sent a letter to Customs Commissioner Luo yesterday, saying: Dear Sir, Since the establishment of the customs office in Shanghai, all customs commissioners have been able to take into account both customs regulations and commercial conditions, so the official and commercial parties have been in harmony. Unfortunately, various accidents have occurred recently, such as privately changing labels, misinterpreting the Suzhou-Hangzhou shipping regulations, detaining and punishing private boats carrying goods without being towed by steamships, and exercising the power of anti-smuggling not in the customs port but breaking into shops for large-scale searches and arbitrarily imposing fines. All of these are unprecedented since the establishment of the Customs. In order to respect the law and safeguard the legitimate interests of our fellow traders, we cannot but ask the government to investigate. According to reports, your Customs Commissioner stated that from the date of your departure from Shanghai on July 12 to the date of your return to Shanghai on October 9, the customs affairs during this period were all handled by Deputy Customs Commissioner Qiao Li. Since the Deputy Customs Commissioner is a member of your Customs Commissioner, you have a responsibility to report the illegal practices and harm to merchants during his term of office. You should truthfully report to the superior official for removal and punishment in order to show fairness and harmonize public opinion. Sincerely, Jianghai Customs Commissioner Luo.</p>
<h3>The Transshipment and Customs Broker Association Requests Reform of the Customs' Harsh Regulations</h3>
<p>Yesterday Submitted to the Customs Administration's Tax Department</p>
<p>A Letter to the Chamber of Commerce Requesting Assistance</p>
<p>The Municipal Transshipment and Customs Broker Association, previously subjected to various oppressive measures by the Jianghai Customs and fined for any incident, convened a general meeting of all members. Yesterday, it collected all facts regarding harsh fines and regulations, compiled them into a detailed report, and sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs Tax Department requesting thorough reform. It also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting assistance, submitting a formal petition to the Customs Administration requesting immediate instructions to the Jianghai Customs Tax Department to improve the situation and alleviate the merchants' difficulties. The submitted letters are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Petition to the Customs Administration: Regarding a Petition. It is humbly submitted that while the state establishes customs to collect taxes, commerce is the source of tax revenue. It seems that those responsible for collecting taxes should embody consideration for merchants' difficulties while enforcing the law, so that the state can be enriched above and the merchants are not harmed below, and the tax revenue will also be substantial. I have observed that since the Jianghai Customs issued new management regulations, there have been many unexpected and harsh demands on our industry. Frankly speaking, fines have become the standard. However, it is not known that our industry acts as a link in indirect tax payment on behalf of customers. Although taxes come from various merchants, the losses are borne by our industry. Moreover, the capital is limited and the profits are meager, how can we withstand such unlimited destruction? Therefore, my colleagues have come to the association to complain. Our association has repeatedly relayed the situation to the Tax Department, requesting them to consider the difficulties of merchants and improve treatment. However, they remain stubborn as ever, and even intensify their actions. If this continues, our industry will have no place to stand. Therefore, the facts of the harsh fines and regulations of Jianghai Customs are compiled one by one into a formal petition. I humbly request your examination and approval, and grant an order to the Jianghai Customs Tax Department to thoroughly improve the situation in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. This would be truly virtuous and convenient. Respectfully submitted. (The letter to the Jianghai Customs Tax Department regarding fines is omitted).</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Respected Sirs, Recently, I read in the newspaper that your esteemed Chamber has specially sent Commissioners Lu and Luo to Beijing to submit petitions to various ministries and departments regarding the bizarre actions of the Jianghai Customs' tax administration. After hearing this, I am deeply moved. However, I have observed that since the Customs became independent in terms of tariff, the various mistakes in its facilities and the arrogance of customs officials have become increasingly serious. Those who suffer directly and most deeply are only our customs brokerage industry. Furthermore, our industry is the link for receiving taxes. Therefore, when the Customs issued new regulations for managing customs brokers last year, none of them were meant to prevent our industry from engaging in malpractice. Our association believed that the regulations were too harsh and repeatedly requested modifications, but all requests were denied. In the end, because it concerns the livelihood of our colleagues, and the law is intended for those who violate it, what is there to fear if the conduct is proper? Therefore, our industry has no choice but to comply with the regulations. However, customs officers regard our industry as easy to bully and exert their oppressive methods. Regardless of the size of the matter or the rights and wrongs, fines are the prerequisite. Among my colleagues, those who prioritize their livelihood either do not argue over small matters or, because the goods have already been declared, if there is any negotiation, all procedures will be delayed, resulting in losses even greater than the fines. They have no choice but to endure it without speaking out. However, they have intensified their actions to the point where our industry will have no place to stand. This is intolerable! Therefore, on October 31st, our association convened a general meeting of all members, collected all the harsh fines and regulations imposed by the Customs, and compiled them one by one into a report requesting the Customs Administration and the Jianghai Customs Tax Department to thoroughly improve the situation. Therefore, this letter is specially addressed to your esteemed Chamber, requesting your full assistance so as to achieve the goal of improvement and alleviate the suffering. I believe that the leaders of your esteemed Chamber share the joys and sorrows of all merchants and will not regard this as an irrelevant matter.</p>
<h3>Reporters' Association to Assist the Luoyang Zhonghua Daily</h3>
<p>Request the Henan Authorities to Investigate Impartially</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists' Association yesterday sent a telegram to the Henan Provincial Party Headquarters and Provincial Government to assist the Luoyang Zhonghua Daily. The original telegram stated: "To the Henan Provincial Party Headquarters and Provincial Government, greetings. According to a letter from Jia Xingyuan, the president of the Luoyang Da Zhonghua Daily, the newspaper was suddenly surrounded on October 5th by Xie Qing, a member of the Luoyang County Party Headquarters Committee, along with Tang Mingzhi, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, leading a security brigade and fifty or sixty police officers, fully armed as if facing a formidable enemy. Silver, money, and clothing were looted, and false instructions were fabricated to arrest the president and vice-president. Xingyuan managed to escape in haste after receiving prior notice. Xie Qing and others, using their authority for revenge and abusing their public office for personal gain, knew they were committing a crime and fabricated reactionary evidence after the fact using stolen newspaper stationery and private seals. Fortunately, County Magistrate Xie Suian refused to acknowledge it. Xie Qing then took the matter to the provincial capital to create an ironclad case. Local authorities and elders in Luoyang jointly telegraphed the province, guaranteeing the integrity of Xie Qing and others and requesting redress. Xingyuan and others also telegraphed the central government and the Henan Party, government, and military authorities to report the case. Now, they have rushed to Shanghai to report the facts and request assistance. It has been decided by the National Assembly to support the development of the news industry. If Xie Qing of the Luoyang County Party Headquarters and Tang Mingzhi, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, fabricated evidence and destroyed public opinion, it would not only be a disregard for the decisions of the central government but also a violation of criminal law. Our association is far away and our knowledge is limited. We urgently request that the Party Headquarters and Government of your province send personnel to investigate impartially and handle the matter fairly. We are endlessly grateful. Qian Cangshuo, Yu Kongwo, Yan Esheng, Qu Shao Yi, and Ma Chonggan, Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Journalists' Association, respectfully."</p>
<h3>The Overseas Chinese Association Will Welcome Huang and Xu</h3>
<p>The First Voice in the Movement to Relieve the Suffering of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Association was initiated by powerful overseas Chinese businessmen in this city, including Guo Shun, General Manager of Shanghai Wing On Textile Co., Ltd. Recently, Jian Yingfu, Associate Manager of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Co., Ltd., has also joined as one of the initiators. It is reported that the pure initiators of the association have reached more than 120 people, and ordinary members have not yet begun to be recruited. Its foundation has already achieved such results, and it is expected that it will have considerable development in the future. Its purpose is to protect overseas Chinese and save the country, and it especially focuses on the movement to relieve the suffering of overseas Chinese. This time, Vietnamese overseas Chinese specially sent representatives Huang An and Xu Yixian back to China to petition regarding the Sino-French Commercial Treaty issue. The Overseas Chinese Association, based on its principle of protecting overseas Chinese, is actually trying to provide effective assistance to relieve the suffering of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Vietnam. Lawyer Wu Chengyu, a standing committee member and chairman of the legal advisory group of the association, initiated a convening of a general meeting of all initiators to discuss assistance methods. It is reported that the association passed the principle of Lawyer Wu's proposal at its second standing committee meeting in the original clubhouse (No. 567, Nanjing Road, 2nd Floor) at 7 pm the day before yesterday. After the overseas Chinese representatives Huang An and others return to Shanghai from Beijing and make contact, a general meeting will be scheduled to jointly promote progress. At the same time, a welcome rally will be held to welcome the two representatives Huang and Xu to express the spirit of love and promote mutual assistance.</p>
<h3>Railway Authorities Deny the Incident of Derailment in Qishuyan</h3>
<p>Only a Slight Collision Due to Improperly Installed Iron Chains</p>
<p>Regarding the rumor that a freight train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway derailed in Qishuyan, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met with railway authorities yesterday. According to them, the derailment reported in the news is not accurate. When the freight train No. 494 arrived in Qishuyan that day, the iron chains connecting the cars were not properly installed during the transfer, resulting in a slight collision, but there was no obstruction. The so-called derailment is just a rumor, and the roadbed and other things were not damaged in the slightest.</p>
<h3>Workers in the French Concession Water and Electricity Company's Workshop Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>The workers in the machinery department workshop of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company went on strike the day before yesterday afternoon because their request for regular holidays was rejected by the foreman. The political department of the French Concession Police Department intervened to mediate. By the evening, the foreman agreed to follow the old practice of giving holidays on the 9th, but the wages for the workers' strike period had to be deducted. All the workers believed that the company was at fault for violating the old practice and refused to have their wages deducted. The police station persuaded the workers to agree to resume work on the 9th. All the workers entered the factory yesterday morning, and took their holiday in the afternoon as usual.</p>

<h3>The Burial of the Deceased Merchant Sheng Xingshu</h3>

<h3>County Security Corps Proclamation Clarifies Rumors</h3>
<p>Prevent Bandit Troubles and Protect the Peace of the Village</p>
<p>Arrive at the Designated Place on Time to Receive Training</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Security Corps issued a proclamation yesterday, stating: "Following the provincial order to organize and train the Security Corps, the original intention was to guide the people to organize systematic self-defense groups to cultivate self-defense capabilities in order to prevent bandit troubles and protect the peace of the village. The good intentions have been clearly announced by the government. Now, the special training class has been completed and the trainees will be dispatched to various districts to inspect the trainees and start universal training. However, there are unscrupulous people fabricating rumors to deceive the people. The ignorant villagers are suspicious and reluctant to move forward. This hinders progress and is regrettable. In addition to ordering the county public security bureaus to pay attention to investigating and arresting the rumor-mongers, this proclamation is hereby issued for all residents of the county to be aware. Know that this training of the Corps is originally to cultivate everyone's self-defense capabilities and bear the responsibility of self-defense in their hometown. The training period is only during the annual agricultural completion, with two or three hours of training per day, which does not hinder everyone's original profession. All trainees who have been enlisted must follow the notification of the squad leader and arrive at the designated place on time to receive training. Do not lightly believe rumors and hesitate to move forward, lest you be detained and fined. If there are still rumor-mongers causing trouble, they will be arrested immediately without leniency. Do not say that you were not warned."</p>
<h3>Collision Between Chinese and British Warships in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Investigating the Issue of Responsibility</p>
<p>After the British aircraft carrier HMS Hermes sailed to Hong Kong, the gunboat HMS Cricket was transferred to Shanghai and anchored in the Huangpu River off the French Concession. Rear Admiral Kelly, commander of the British naval forces stationed in China, had already left Shanghai on the 7th of this month aboard his flagship HMS Cornflower for Hong Kong. At around 1 pm yesterday, the Chinese merchant ship Anxing was entering Shanghai from Wusong. When the ship reached the river in front of the French Concession, the ship was washed by the tide. Also, because the driver could not control it, the bow of the Anxing suddenly crashed into the outer hull of the British gunboat HMS Cricket, which was anchored in the river. The British warship could not avoid the collision because it was anchored in the river. Both the Anxing and the British warship were damaged to an unknown extent. After the incident, the shipowner and captain reported to the customs harbor master, who sent personnel to investigate and inquire about the responsibility for the incident.</p>

<p>Ningbo Native Place Association Telegram Requesting Thorough Investigation of the Ningbo Shatin Branch Bureau</p>
<p>Continued Submission of Documents to Three Agencies</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shatin Branch Bureau does not handle Shatin affairs in accordance with the regulations issued by the Ministry and the detailed rules of procedure. There are numerous cases of illegal actions disturbing the people. The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai has repeatedly received reports from fellow villagers, business owners, that their land ownership has been illegally deprived and requested assistance. It has previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Shatin General Bureau to request prevention. Now, regarding the case of Wu Fuzhen, it has continued to telegraph the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Shatin General Bureau, stating: "According to fellow villager Wu Fuzhen, Fuzhen's ancestral house on Binjiang Road in Ningbo was rented to Shengshenghuo goods company for use as a warehouse. The house was purchased in December of the 19th year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, with a deed and payment of grain and rent. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, he complied with the order to register with the Ningbo Shatin Branch Bureau and was issued Property Management Certificate No. 1016 by the Bureau. When the Municipal Land Registration Office was established, he also registered and held Registration Certificate No. 2268 with the character 'You'. Recently, Zhang Yangwu of the Jiangdong Damao Bone Shop sent a letter to Shengshenghuo shop stating that he had purchased the land from the Shatin Bureau and asked him to contact him. Fuzhen was shocked and went to the Shatin Bureau to question him. Unexpectedly, the staff of the Bureau evaded him with the excuse of overdue registration. Later, he held a deed from the Jiaqing period and a municipal registration certificate for two houses on Houtang Street, as well as a Shatin Bureau Property Management Certificate. On April 1st of this year, the Shatin Bureau went to correct the measurement form due to an error in the re-measurement procedure, but the form was not issued. He was deeply afraid that it would be sold again and went to the Bureau to request it. The staff of the Bureau again made excuses for being overdue and requiring a bid. Also, Wu Yufang's house has a land area of three mu, eight li, and six mao, with a deed and a municipal registration certificate. On October 4th of the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Shatin Bureau had a registration receipt and a draft measurement form. The Bureau forced him to pay 480 yuan due to the deadline. This is deliberately creating difficulties and extortion, and there is no guarantee of property rights. The victims have presented petitions to the county government and the local court for relief, but the petitions are full of complaints and nothing has been done. Therefore, we respectfully request to take measures. The Ningbo Shatin Branch Bureau arbitrarily disposes of civilian land with legal contracts. We have telegraphed your ministry (government) to legally prevent it. The above is the general outline of the situation. We urgently request you to review and verify it, and quickly send personnel to thoroughly investigate and maintain the original property rights to prevent disputes and maintain local peace."</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case in Beichuan Sha</h3>
<p>Nine People Kidnapped</p>
<p>Ransom of 100,000 Yuan Demanded</p>
<p>Li Fengming (known as Little Foreigner), the eldest son of the late villager Li Jisheng (nicknamed Old Foreigner) in Beichuan Sha Erli Xu, Baoshan County, and his sister-in-law Ms. Liu and other nine people were kidnapped by pirates in mid-September. A ransom of $300,000 was demanded. Of the kidnapped, Ms. Liu and Ms. Wang escaped from the bandit den in Dasha, across the Liu River, and returned home safely at the end of last month. It is now known that after Ms. Liu and others returned home, their family received another letter from the bandits yesterday, stating that Ms. Liu and others were intentionally released to go home to communicate and raise money for the ransom. They now need to prepare $100,000 and send it to Sanjia Shuikou. A sailing boat with a box on the bow is the one. You must put the $100,000 in the box and cover the lid. The hostages can return home in two days. If you do not comply, we will take the last resort. The family was very anxious after receiving the letter, but they could not raise such a large sum of money and had to listen to it.</p>
<h3>A Conspiracy by Kidnappers to Rob and Obtain Funds as Kidnapping Capital</h3>
<p>The plan was unsuccessful and they were arrested</p>
<p>Zhao Yongqing and Xu Bingnan, Chinese detectives from the Huishan Police Station, previously learned that a large number of bandits were hiding in Room 111 of the Zhongzhou Hotel on Shandong Road. They reported to the head detective and, together with Western detective Arerqiqin, secretly went to the room and arrested Cai Yinlong from Pudong, Ruan Yongfang from Nanjing, Zhou Yuanlong from Qingjiang, Chu Xuezhen from Yangzhou, Zhu Deshan, Zhu Linsheng from Shanghai, Zhou Gengyuan, Yao Liuliang from Pudong, Xue Lian Zhang, a woman, and Ms. Yuan Chen and other ten people. A pistol and six bullets were seized and taken to the First District Court for investigation. Yesterday, after further investigation, Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the former police station, stated that during the adjournment, it was discovered that the defendants had rented rooms in the hotel to discuss kidnapping Gong Guisheng, who lived at No. 140 Gubart Road in the French Concession. Gong was scheduled to marry on the 17th of last month, and his family was quite wealthy. They planned to kidnap him the day before and demand a large ransom, but the cars, guns, and hiding places were not fully prepared, so they did not act. Later, Cai Yinlong, Ruan Yongfang, Zhu Linsheng, Zhou Yuanlong, Chu Xuezhen, Zhu Deshan, and others prepared pistols, cars, and a house to hide the hostage, and sent the pistol to the woman Yuan Chen. They were still short of several hundred yuan for expenses. They learned that Tang Laowu's construction factory at No. 52 Jianye Lane, Fululi Road in the French Concession, always had 2,000 yuan ready to be paid to the workers. They planned to rob the factory to get the money and start kidnapping Gong. At that time, they were gathering in the hotel and were secretly arrested by detectives from the police station. It was discovered that the first defendant, Cai Yinlong, had robbed Li Weilin's house at No. 478 Dagu Road with four other accomplices on the morning of February 26th of this year, stealing more than 6,000 yuan worth of property, clothing, etc. Cai confessed that one piece of clothing was pawned at No. 20 Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession for 13 yuan, and the case had been suspended. Some jewelry was pledged at Dehe Silver Shop at No. 124 Dama Road in the French Concession. Detectives checked with the silver shop, which said that all the jewelry had been melted, and only the bill was copied and brought back. It was also stated that the police had confirmed that Zhou Liangyuan, Yao Guoliang, and Xue Lianzhang, three of the defendants, were not related to the case and should be released first. The guns, bullets, clothing, and the receipt from the pawn shop were presented for inspection. Xue Lianzhang and others hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend them. Judge Zhao questioned each defendant about their age and origin. Because the number of defendants in this case was large and the case was complicated, the hearing could not be completed in the morning, so the judge ordered a special hearing at a later date. Each defendant was returned to custody separately. Zhou Liangyuan, Yao Guoliang, Xue Lianzhang, and other three were allowed to be released.</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Two Security Corps Members</h3>
<p>A Dispute Arising from a Search</p>
<p>Yan Huaigao Shot and Injured</p>
<p>On the evening before last (the 8th), Qiao Defa, a member of the fourth team of the Pengpu District Security Corps, was stationed on guard between Zhongshan Road and Hutai Road and was checking pedestrians. Yan Huaigao, a member of the Hutai Road sub-defense post, passed by. Yan was wearing plain clothes, so Qiao Defa searched him according to regulations. However, Yan firmly refused the inspection, so the two sides had a verbal conflict that almost turned violent. Another pedestrian mediated and persuaded the two sides to disperse. However, Qiao was still angry and took a wooden-cased gun to the Hutai Road sub-defense post at around 10 am yesterday to reason with Yan. Therefore, the two had another argument. Before long, Qiao opened fire on Yan's lower body. The first shot missed, but the second bullet pierced Yan's left leg. Nearby police officers heard the gunshots and rushed to the sub-defense post and saw that Yan had been injured and had fallen to the ground. They detained Qiao and took him to the Fourth District Office for questioning.</p>
<h3>The Second Special Court Burns Confiscated Drugs</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Jiangsu Second Special District Local Court, all drugs, opium, morphine, heroin, red and white pills, and drug paraphernalia confiscated in cases handled by the police station have been publicly burned every three months. By the end of June of this year, it has been destroyed three times. Now, all the drugs confiscated in the three months from July 1st to the end of September of this year have been scheduled by President Ying Changshi and Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan to be destroyed for the fourth time at 3 pm on the 19th of this month. The location is designated as the vacant land on the east side of the court. A public notice was issued yesterday and reported to the Judicial Administration Department and the Jiangsu Higher Third Branch Court. Separate letters were sent to various organizations in Shanghai, including military, government, judicial, police, business, drug refusal associations, and lawyers' associations, inviting them to send representatives to the site to supervise.</p>
<h3>Ren Zhennan Released on Bail During Retrial</h3>
<p>On the Grounds of His Father's Death</p>
<p>6,000 Yuan Shop Guarantee Provided</p>
<p>Ren Zhennan, a lawyer, was accused by real estate businessman Zhuang Chunpu of defrauding him of 5,476 yuan in settlement fees in the divorce case of Huang Lianxiang. The Shanghai Local Court sentenced Ren to four months in prison in the first instance and ordered him to return the private prosecution. Ren was dissatisfied and appealed to the collegial panel of the court, which changed the sentence to eight months in prison. He has been detained for thirteen months. Ren then appealed to the Jiangsu Higher Court for a third trial. Because Zhuang's wife, Zhuang Li, stated at the Ningbo Native Place Association that the amount was 5,560 yuan, which was inconsistent, the case was sent back for retrial. Judge Huang Changyuan held a hearing yesterday. Ren Zhennan stated that Zhuang Chunpu was sued for bigamy by Huang Lianxiang in the French Concession. He first hired lawyer Fei Xizhen, and then Qian Yumin and Gu Gongda introduced him to hire me as his defense attorney. The public fee was 200 taels, which has been received and there is a receipt. However, Zhuang did not appear in court three times. The French Concession wanted to issue an arrest warrant. I requested it, and Zhuang appeared in court for the fourth time. I persuaded Zhuang to appear in court. Unexpectedly, Zhuang Li was detained. She came to ask me for her husband. I couldn't stand her nagging, so I terminated the engagement and came to accuse me out of hatred. I really didn't take his money. Zhuang Li stated that it was true that she paid Ren Zhennan 200 taels for public fees, and there was a receipt for it. Regarding the settlement fee mentioned by Ren and the introduction fee of the other lawyer, the first time was 280 yuan, then 696 yuan, then 1,000 yuan, then 3,000 yuan, and a check for 500 yuan. As for the total amount agreed upon at the Ningbo Native Place Association, it may have included public fees or was a mistake. I have always said the same amount as above. Witnesses include Qian Yumin, Gu Gongda, Zhuang Qihuai, etc. Because he is a lawyer, we dared to be bold and did not have a receipt, so we would dare not accuse the lawyer. As for my husband being in Tianjin now, he has not arrived. At this point, the official ordered that the case still needed to be heard again, and the defendant's lawyer, Xue Jiaqi, immediately stated that the defendant's father had just died and requested permission to release him on bail. After questioning, the official approved bail of 6,000 yuan to be provided by a shop.</p>
<h3>Why Must You Die If You Fail to Join the Army?</h3>
<p>Ge Zhuxiang has Aspirations?</p>
<p>The Day to Serve the Country is Long</p>
<p>At around 9 pm the night before last, a young man named Ge Zhuxiang went alone to the Jiangtian Wharf in the Sixteenth Bund and took a ferry to Pudong. Near Lan Nidu, he suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. His body floated with the tide to the dock. A guard rescued him and took him to the Third District Police Station. According to the interrogation by Director Zhang, his name is Ge Zhuxiang, 18 years old, from Shaoxing, and he is an apprentice at the Xinda Customs Brokerage Firm on Yongan Street in the French Concession. Since the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, he has long wanted to join the Volunteer Army to kill the enemy, but due to various reasons, his wish has not been fulfilled. Recently, he entrusted a friend to buy military uniforms, but he was cheated out of five yuan and did not return. He wanted to save the country but was hindered in every way. It is better to die to repay the country. According to the confession, the director immediately sent police to summon the manager of the firm, Yang Huaitang, to the district. Yang claimed that he had searched Ge's drawer and found twelve letters of farewell. The director then ordered him to accompany Ge and supervise him to avoid another suicide attempt.</p>
<h3>Investigation of a Strange Murder Case</h3>
<p>The Man and Woman are Likely Servants</p>
<p>In the pavilion room of the house of Ms. Lu Hou, a Nanjing native, at No. 13 Shude Lane, Xujiahui, Shanghai, a man and a woman rented the room. After renting, the woman was strangled to death in the bed that night, and the man escaped. All the details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, Director Liu of the Second Section of the Sixth District ordered Xu Jianyu, the sixth Tudi Bao in the 28th Bao, to report to the local court for an autopsy. When the prosecutor and others arrived for the autopsy, Ms. Lu Li, the daughter-in-law of Lu Hou, and others stated that on the morning of the 7th of this month, a man wearing a blue cloth gown came to rent the room, claiming that he was a teacher at Nanyang Middle School. At 5:30 pm, he came with a woman, also wearing blue cloth clothes, who was said to be his wife. The only things they brought were a palm canopy and two cotton quilts. After arriving, the woman even washed rice and cooked dinner in a foreign stove. There were no signs of anything unusual. When asked about the rent, they said they would pay tomorrow. The next morning, the pavilion room was not opened, and they didn't know why. So, in the middle of the day, they knocked on the door to ask for the rent and found that the woman was dead, lying on the bed. After the judges and others confirmed that the female corpse was about 30 years old and was strangled to death with a rope, they ordered the collection of evidence and the arrest of the murderer. However, the judges examined the deceased and, according to the second landlord, the man's clothing was not that of an intellectual, but rather the shape of lower-class servants. Therefore, the investigation of the deceased's family is also underway.</p>
<h3>Flourishing Business of Shanghai National Goods Company</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the Shanghai National Goods Company on Nanjing Road has seen very prosperous business due to its high-quality goods and low prices.

Therefore, business is thriving threefold, and customers are unusually crowded. It is heard that yesterday, the value of goods sold exceeded twenty thousand gold.</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Company's letter to national goods organizations reads: "Respectfully, since the company's founding, we have been collecting products from famous factories, displaying and selling them in separate sections, making it easy for our countrymen to recognize and purchase them conveniently. However, with the wide variety of goods, there is an urgent need for review and improvement. We have long admired your association as a pioneer in national goods with rich experience. Therefore, we respectfully invite your association's committee members to visit our company at 2:00 PM on the fifteenth of this month to review each item and assess its strengths and weaknesses, and to provide guidance on how to improve.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing in response to a news report on the Xujiahui murder case published in your newspaper on November 9th, which stated, "The murderer, so-and-so, claimed to be from Jiangyin and a professor at Nanyang University." After investigation, none of our school's professors reside at No. 13, Shude Fang.

<p>Any Municipal Councilor who is convicted of violating the provisions of this section shall be liable to a fine of up to fifty pounds. The court that convicts the Municipal Councilor may remove him from his position as a Municipal Councilor without replacement, but if it is proven that the Municipal Councilor's violation of the provisions of this section was due to error or negligence, and not due to any lack of integrity, then the court shall not issue this order.</p>
<p>(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, no Municipal Councilor shall be prohibited from voting or discussing the following matters in the Municipal Council or any committee of the Municipal Council:</p>
<p>(A) Any plan to propose special taxes or</p>
<p>(B) Establishing a price list or its general applicable regulations or conditions regarding the supply of any items or the provision of any services by the Municipal Council within all or part of the district.</p>

<p>43. Disqualification of Dismissed Municipal Councilors</p>

<h3>Fifth Issue Concerning the Status of Employees of the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>A. Recommendations of the Foreign Employees Association</p>
<p>1.  The "Shanghai Municipal Council Foreign Employees Association" is a group established with the approval of the Board of Directors, with the main purpose of safeguarding the interests of all foreign employees working in the Municipal Council. With the exception of employees serving in the Police Department, who, according to their terms of service, are not allowed to join as members, almost all foreign employees of the Municipal Council are members of the association (Note 1). The reform of the Public Concession Governance Organization Law has an impact on the status and future of foreign employees of the Municipal Council. The association has raised this issue and asked me to make recommendations.</p>
<p>2.  Representatives of the association pointed out that most foreign employees working in the Municipal Council have a perception that the council often provides them with a kind of career in which they can dedicate their entire lives, with the expectation of receiving benefits from pensions and retirement savings. If, due to the adoption of a policy of employing Chinese staff, or due to fundamental changes in the terms of service, rather than due to any fault on the part of the foreign staff themselves, foreign staff have to leave their jobs before reaching the usual retirement age and without qualifying for a pension, the difficulties they face will be extremely significant.</p>
<p>3. The association then recommended that a plan be devised to protect the interests of foreign employees before the current organizational law of the Public Concession, as contained in the Land Regulations, is fundamentally reformed, resulting in adverse consequences for the status of foreign employees of the Municipal Council. This plan should be implemented as part of any new method of the proposed reform organization law, and a special committee should be established to formulate this plan. The committee should be composed of representatives from the Municipal Council and the Foreign Employees Association of the Council, as well as experts, and should include one or more Chinese members. The plan formulated by the committee should have two purposes:</p>
<p>(1) To guarantee as much as possible that foreign employees who are still employed by the Municipal Council on the date of implementing any fundamental reform of the organizational law of the Public Concession will continue to hold office, and that their terms of reference, in terms of remuneration and benefits, and in terms of status and promotion, will be the same as those previously enjoyed.</p>
<p>(2) It should be stipulated how to give full remuneration to foreign employees who are dismissed before the expiration of their expected continued service as a direct or indirect result of organizational law reform.</p>
<p>The association further proposed that within this plan, there should be a provision for the establishment of an arbitration committee. Any foreign employee who believes that he or she should be entitled to remuneration under the final provisions of the proposed plan should be decided by the arbitration committee, and a special fund should be pre-allocated and placed in the custody of a management committee so that the remuneration that should be given in accordance with this plan can be paid from this fund.

<h3>Carelessly</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Six Arts of Dealing with the World!</p>
<p>One cannot do things carelessly, and one cannot do things carelessly. If it should be done but is not done, that is carelessness, and that is not permissible. If it should be done well but is not done well, that is carelessness, and that is not permissible. Therefore, the four characters "carelessly" are actually a morbid state of fragile and perfunctory psychology.</p>
<p>If we talk about the art of dealing with the world, it cannot be like this.</p>
<p>There are things that should be done carelessly, and things that should not be done carelessly. The ancients said, "Clear water has no big fish." They also said, "If one is not quick-eared and slow-witted, one cannot be the head of the family." These are all examples of things that cannot be done without being careless. If a person deals with the world by scheming and competing everywhere, and calculating every penny, it will be too difficult to be a person and too painful to use one's mind. Therefore, if it can be done carelessly, then do it carelessly. If it really cannot be done carelessly, then it cannot be done carelessly.</p>
<p>The ancients had a saying, "Be muddled on small matters, but not on big matters." This means that small matters can be done carelessly, but big matters must not be done carelessly. This statement is correct. However, it is originally a difficult question as to what should be used to distinguish between big and small matters. The words "big" and "small" are originally comparative terms, not absolute terms. For example, if matter A is originally of great importance, but encounters matter B that is of even greater importance, then matter A is small and matter B is large. If matter A is originally not big, but encounters matter B that is even smaller, then matter A is large and matter B is small. For example, the Yangzhou tax collection turmoil is of great importance to the livelihood of a county's population, and it can originally be considered a big matter. However, compared to the war between Han and Liu in Shandong Province and the war between the two Lius in Sichuan Province, then Yangzhou is a small matter, and Sichuan and Shandong are big matters. The Yangzhou affair can be done carelessly, but the Sichuan and Shandong affairs cannot be done carelessly. The Sichuan and Shandong wars are indeed of great importance to our country. However, compared to the loss of territory in Dong Province and the organization of the puppet state, then the Sichuan and Shandong incidents are still small, and the Dong Province incident is serious. The Sichuan and Shandong incidents can be done carelessly, but the Dong Province incident must not be done carelessly. Now, our country is still doing the Dong Province incident carelessly. I ask, what else cannot be passed carelessly? Carelessness is indeed an excellent way to deal with the world. Therefore, I advise everyone to be careless.</p>

<h3>Expressing Feelings</h3>
<p>— Meng Jiao</p>
<p>In the past, I wrote a poem expressing my feelings, and with the support of fellow enthusiasts from home and abroad who composed poems in response, not wanting to conceal my clumsiness, I superimposed the previous rhyme.</p>
<p>Calling out has no plan to wake from a dream, touching my eyes, the rivers and mountains are broken. Alone at court, my heart is isolated, and I repeatedly presented letters, in anger at the times, I often tore my sword upon sharpening. I cannot bear the wind and cranes alarming the central lands, every time I face Xinting, my tears fall. When will my horse's hooves eliminate the captives, and level the three islands to vent the waves of the past?</p>
<h3>Answering Lord Feng Shangduan's Poem Lamenting National Crisis, Using a Coincidental Rhyme</h3>
<p>After the catastrophe, the rivers and mountains are also worth lamenting, the war marks on the sand fields are half desolate. The golden chalice is missing, I sadly turn my head, the national shame fills my chest, I vow not to forget. The sound of drums and horns are loud across the snowy ground, the bronze camel weeps in the cold twilight. Who can salvage a game half-finished? Stroking my ruler's sword, I sigh with prolonged emotion.</p>

<h3>A SIMPLE AND SATISFACTORY SNOW CREAM RECIPE</h3>
<p>— Lushuang</p>
<p>As the weather turns cold, tender faces need a moisturizer. Honey and glycerin, however, are too sticky and therefore disliked by many, allowing snow cream to take the lead.</p>
<p>Snow cream recipes are scattered throughout cosmetic manufacturing books, but if you follow their methods, the results are often unsatisfactory. This isn't because the methods they introduce are wrong, but because they don't provide detailed instructions.</p>
<p>In our laboratory, during our free time, we also play around with these things. After multiple improvements and experiments, we've come up with a simple and effective method. While the product may not be as good as the top-tier products on the market, it's sufficient for winter use and very affordable. You might want to give it a try.</p>
<p>Prepare: 3 ounces of stearin, 6 mace of sodium carbonate, 6 mace of glycerin, 6 teacups of water, fragrance, two glass or aluminum pots, two alcohol stoves, and one glass rod.</p>
<p>Procedure: Once all the above items are ready, place the stearin in a pot and melt it over heat. Place the sodium carbonate and water in another pot and heat to around 90 degrees Celsius. If the stearin has completely melted at this point, gradually pour in the sodium carbonate solution (at around 90 degrees Celsius), stirring with the glass rod as you pour, and continuing to heat from below. After pouring, add the prepared glycerin, at which point it should form a snow-white paste. Heat for another quarter of an hour, ensuring the flame isn't too strong, stirring as it heats. Finally, remove from heat and place in a cool place to let it cool. Once completely cooled, add the fragrance and mix well to complete.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>1.  The sodium carbonate solution must be around 90 degrees Celsius or brought to a boil before being poured into the stearin.</p>
<p>2.  The amount of glycerin and fragrance can be adjusted as desired, but they must be added after cooling.</p>
<p>3.  The more accurate the proportions of stearin and sodium carbonate, the better.</p>
<p>4.  If it's too dry after cooling, you can add an appropriate amount of boiling water before adding the fragrance, heating it briefly to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>5.  All the above raw materials are available in Western pharmacies. Except for the fragrance, the other three ingredients cost about one yuan per pound, with the fragrance being relatively more expensive.</p>

<h3>DISCUSSING CONCUBINAGE</h3>
<p>— Zongwen</p>
<p>| A Family Issue Worth Discussing |</p>
<p>"Concubinage" is inherently an utterly evil system in society. It's here that countless women's personalities have been degraded, and countless women's lives have been sacrificed. It is one of the heinous weapons – old etiquette – designed to dismember women. Therefore, to liberate women and grant them equal status with men in society, we must overthrow the utterly evil "concubinage system." Moreover, it is one of the evils left behind by the extended family system. Today, extended families should be abolished because the harms of extended families are too numerous to mention. How many people in society suffer from it! Therefore, the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo satirized our internal strife with the following illustration:</p>
<p>Republic of China</p>
<p>(Translation): "The League Council is approaching," Mother said. "You children must be good and not make noise! You should be polite when the old uncles of the League come!"</p>
<p>To prevent extended families from existing in society, we must first fundamentally solve the concubinage system! It is indeed an exceptionally cruel and inhumane matter!</p>
<p>The monogamous system is inherently a good marriage system. However, many men, failing to realize this, are still enamored with the idea of one wife and several concubines, truly regarding women as lacking personhood. Consequently, scenes of jealousy and rivalry, a "domestic drama," or perhaps even a "domestic tragedy," unfold within the family! Can such a family possibly have peaceful days? From morning till night, only scolding, crying, yelling, and lamenting sounds are heard. Isn't this suffering the harm of an extended family? The Shanghai Education Bureau has erected a very large sign in the City God Temple within the city, which reads: "If you want your family to be unhappy, take a concubine." It even includes colored illustrations. What a striking slogan, indeed perfectly true!</p>
<p>But why keep a concubine in an otherwise good family? The reasons can be categorized into three types:</p>
<p>(1) Satisfying one's own carnal desires: Many men, bearing the golden signboard of "There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest," are actually practicing concubinage to satisfy their own carnal desires. This is precisely an unfilial man using his evil "money" to insult women. His goal is not to have sons or dislike his wife, but rather to satisfy his own bestial desires! This is most prevalent in old-fashioned autocratic families, especially among Chinese warlords, such as the family of the "Dog Meat General."</p>
<p>(2) For the sake of sons: Some men genuinely want to have sons because the old saying of Confucius, "There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest," is deeply imprinted in their minds. However, his wife happens not to bear sons, so he is forced to take a concubine. The purposes are no more than four points: (1) preparing for old age, (2) wanting someone to provide for him in old age, (3) continuing the family line, (4) managing the inheritance. But this phenomenon is also more common in extended families. We often hear the phrase "marry a wife and have children." It is evident that the purpose of Chinese marriage is nothing more than having sons. Naturally, not having sons inevitably leads to taking a concubine. However, whether taking a concubine will actually result in sons is also a question. Due to space limitations, I cannot elaborate. But taking a concubine is ultimately an inhumane act. I hope that men of this type will quickly awaken. If they are anxious to have sons, practicing "adoption" or "passing on" is not necessarily impossible!</p>
<p>(3) Dissatisfaction with one's spouse! It's also very pitiful because, due to dissatisfaction with one's spouse, one has no choice but to privately take a concubine. This type mostly occurs under old-fashioned marriages, which are arranged by "parents' orders and matchmaker's words." Eventually, one becomes dissatisfied with their partner, but dare not formally announce a divorce. To satisfy the dryness of one's sexuality and the transgression of one's spirit, one has no choice but to practice concubinage. But this is still forgivable. These people are mostly self-aware youths forced out of suffering. Alas! Old-fashioned marriages are truly harmful! Be cautious!</p>
<p>But how should we remedy this concubinage system? In my humble opinion, it should be carried out in three aspects, with the following methods:</p>
<p>(1) Reform the extended family system and promote the nuclear family system. | This is the fundamental solution.</p>
<p>(2) Legal remedy | The law is to protect human rights. Since men and women are equally equal, women should have the same protection. There should be explicit provisions in the law to abolish the concubinage system. Hereafter, no man should be allowed to take a concubine; otherwise, it will be considered bigamy. In this way, I think many men would not dare to do it!</p>
<p>(3) Gender awareness | Men should be aware that this is an inhumane act, and women should respect their own personalities and refuse to degenerate. They should reject this type of marriage. Never covet men's money and willingly become men's slaves! Remember: "One wrong step leads to eternal regret; turning back is a hundred years too late." Never kill yourself!</p>

<h3>COLD SHIVERS - RANDOM NOTES</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The autumn wind has hardened its heart and swept the ginkgo leaves, scattering them all over the ground, keeping the street cleaners busy collecting the remains of the defeated. This is truly worthy of sentimental scholars and Taoists shaking their heads and sighing, saying, "Alas! It is over now, what more can be said?"</p>
<p>Wealthy grandmothers occasionally give away some cold porridge and cold rice, and people praise them as "greatly compassionate." However, if a poverty-stricken ghost, driven by hunger and cold, helplessly steals three copper coins from someone to buy a sesame cake, people denounce him as "taking what is not his." The hearts of people in the world are like this, so it is truly difficult to be a poor man.</p>
<p>Middle-aged people most desire money, and elderly people most desire children and grandchildren. This is the common psychology of people, especially the characteristics of us Chinese.</p>
<p>We watch bulls fight on the wild slopes, happy and laughing, even shouting loudly. Foreigners see Chinese warlords fighting each other, happy and laughing, and they also shout loudly.</p>
<p>As the weather grows cold and the year draws to a close, the blood of the Northeast Volunteer Army stains the white snow crimson. Therefore, we should provide financial assistance. But there is a better and more practical way to help, and that is to join the Northeast Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>When life is poor and difficult, one is willing to die, but if there is even a glimmer of hope, one feels terrified of death. Therefore, praising death is always the fantasy of poets. But the cowardly survival of a subjugated official is ultimately not as good as dying for the national struggle. That is to say, the life of a dog is ultimately not as meaningful as the death of a group of ants.</p>
<p>A horde of heads is better than ten hordes of cannonballs; a skeleton is better than ten beauties. Therefore, good men should recognize skeletons, reject beauties, and hurl their fiery heads to the Northeast to charge and fight hand-to-hand.</p>
<p>Yellow makes people tired, black makes people despair, red makes people excited, and white is bland and tasteless.</p>

<h3>LETTER TO THE EDITOR</h3>
<p>To Mr. Lushuang,</p>
<p>I have read your article "Uses of Vinegar" and have a question regarding the section on removing moles and warts. I would like to ask if I can also use vinegar to remove two small [mouse] moles on my face using the method you described.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Huang Muyin</p>
<h3>A KIND REMINDER TO CONTRIBUTORS</h3>
<p>We are very grateful to all of you for your contributions to our publication. However, we have discovered that eight articles have been published simultaneously or sequentially in our publication and various daily newspaper supplements. Some contributors have inevitably plagiarized from other newspapers and fraudulently claimed payment. Additionally, many contributors have submitted articles to our publication, which were not published, and then resubmitted them to other newspapers, resulting in duplicate publications. This is a difficult problem. Currently, there are many newspaper supplements, as well as weekly and monthly publications. Assuming plagiarism, it is practically impossible to identify. However, this is a matter of the contributor's personal integrity and only involves a minority. The most difficult issue is submitting the same article to multiple publications. Contributors who submit articles to our publication, finding that they have not been published within two or three days, assume that the article has been rejected and is unlikely to be published, so they resubmit it to other newspapers. The pain of our editors lies in this point. Our publication does not have a fixed length, so we must publish a few more articles each day. Assuming that we find an article that can be published, we will immediately send it for typesetting. However, due to the abundance of articles, it may be sent for typesetting the next day or the day after. After typesetting, it may not be included due to space limitations. Therefore, some articles may be published five or six days later, and some may even be published ten or more days later. We must ask for your forgiveness. If we were to ask contributors to submit to only one publication and not to others, we would have no legal or logical basis for preventing other publications from publishing it if our publication could not. We want the editors to pay attention to everything and see all the newspapers, but it is difficult to manage even for young and strong individuals, let alone someone like me who is old and weak. Reluctantly, we can only ask contributors that if they see that an article has already been published in publication A, they should immediately notify publication B to avoid publishing it. This way, the problem will be reduced. We have already respectfully informed you of this method, but we have not received your understanding, and this type of situation continues to occur, which is very distressing. In the future, we hope that you will follow this method and pay extra attention. We would be most grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Supplement Editorial Department</p>

<h3>HOLLYWOOD AND THE US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</h3>
<p>— Jieke</p>
<p>Hollywood has always seemed like an otherworld detached from politics. Campaigning politicians never set foot near the studio gates, and all the stars and actors seemed deprived of their right to vote. However, this year is different. Hundreds of stars will be voting in the US presidential election this year, a first for them in their lives.</p>
<p>The number of voters in Hollywood is also not small. After many campaigning politicians began to approach them, Hollywood became an area of political importance.</p>
<p>RKO Pictures held a grand banquet at its studio to entertain US Senate candidate McAdoo and formally introduced him to all its employees. Warner Brothers also held a political dance, with McAdoo as the special guest, inviting key personnel from various studios to participate. They also formed a Roosevelt-Garner Club, preparing to host a Hollywood civic assembly. Key Hollywood executives, such as Schenck, Lasky, Lehrman, Sidman, Cohn, Harry Cohn, and McCreary, have all expressed their support. There is a growing trend in the American film industry to fully support Roosevelt.</p>
<p>The situation at MGM is slightly different. Hearst is a passionate Democrat, but manager Mayer is a good friend of President Hoover and has stayed at the White House. Whether MGM personnel will support the Democrats or the Republicans is still uncertain.</p>
<p>Because of the economic panic and other personal interests, American film stars, both male and female, are united in voting this year. Deng Ailing, Meng Gaomei, Little Van Dyke, and Bowers were previously stage performers without a fixed residence, and this autumn marks their first time voting.</p>
<p>Noma Shearer grew up in Canada and recently became an American citizen. She hired a private tutor to help her study political economy and American history. This year, she is also voting for the first time. Mary Pickford is also a Canadian native. She became an American citizen a few years ago when she married Owen Moore. She and Van Dyke are among the more politically minded stars, so they are unwilling to give up their right to vote whenever they have the opportunity. They are especially concerned this year. Van Dyke is currently traveling abroad and has asked a representative to vote for him.</p>
<p>Marlene Dietrich, Charlie Chaplin, Eliza Landi, Clive Brook, and Silver Lai have not yet become American citizens, so they cannot vote this year. McDonald has always automatically given up his right to vote, but this year he has found the courage to vote.</p>
<p>Stars who have lived in Hollywood for a long time were previously uninterested in politics, so many have given up their right to vote. Corinne Griffith is one of them. Dayle, Hamilton, Gary Cooper, Binglio Haubipi, and Daniel are also this type of star who are unwilling to vote. Bi Bi has now given birth to Ning Xin'er. To fulfill her duty as a mother, she will vote this year. Constance Bennett has now become a wealthy woman, and she is voting this year because of tax issues.</p>
<p>There is also a Hewro Ji, who received sixty-six votes when the Democratic National Convention nominated a candidate for president.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>REVIEW OF "THE HUDDLE"</h3>
<p>— Yannan</p>
<p>Since Valentino's death, the most revered male beauty in the film industry has always been Ramon Novarro, especially as he is popular with women all over the world.</p>
<p>He has made many talkies. Relying on his God-given golden voice, he is even more brilliant than in the silent era. The brilliance of his silent masterpieces, Ben-Hur and The Student Prince, has been overshadowed by the talkies Pagan Love Song, Call of All Flesh, and the recent Mata Hari.</p>
<p>The Huddle, which premiered at the Cathay today, fully demonstrates that his youth is still surging, and his art is moving into its golden age. In this film, he still knows how to use his talents to win the audience's sympathy, using his rural state and weakness in the first half to contrast with his bravery and liveliness in the second half, revealing the scene of an American hero. Although his singing is not much, it is enough for us to savor.</p>
<p>The supporting cast is not bad – of course, not as organized as in Mata Hari – but Maggie Evans is commendable. Henry Armetta, who plays the father, also interjects well, turning the film into a comedy throughout.</p>
<p>In terms of directing, no loopholes can be found. The photography and lighting can also be said to be commendable. The scenery seems to have been filmed at Yale University. The film pays close attention to the ball game scenes, the movements are fast and clear, and it must be admitted that this is the skill of the American film industry.</p>
<p>The film depicts a student, from the countryside to the urban university, reforming his actions and environment step by step, until graduation, using very short shots to capture the drama.</p>
<h3>"A HAPPY YEAR"</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>When we have some worries, we hope to forget them. Therefore, Warner Brothers and First National, etc., all agree that the 1933 films should focus on comedy, making the coming year "A Happy Year." Almost all the productions end with reunions, and stories with a sad taste are changed.</p>
<p>But with depression in our hearts and nowhere to vent, keeping it suppressed for a year is too much. What is to be done?</p>
<p>The four years in this film do not seem rough, and the dialogue is concise and clear. Every sentence is indispensable, so it is indeed very powerful.</p>
<p>The depiction of the lives of general "privileged children" at American asset universities is very realistic and interesting. Many people sing marching songs, which can also stir up people's excitement.</p>
<p>In short, this film is a college student romantic comedy. Although there is no deep meaning beyond that, it is at least worth appreciating.</p>
<p>Film Studio Anecdotes</p>
<h3>THE HARDSHIPS OF EXTRAS</h3>
<p>— Mai</p>
<p>Moonlight Pictures. Since taking over the Great Wall Studio, the films they have produced have all been sold to the South Sea Islands overseas. Therefore, martial arts dramas are their main output.</p>
<p>Yesterday, they started shooting the "Fighting Arena" scene. The extras in the scene numbered forty-five people, and two cameras worked simultaneously. One took close-ups, and the other took wide shots. In theory, it should be faster than shooting with a single camera. However, they prepared from 3:00 PM until 4:00 AM the next morning before they finished. Therefore, the extras suffered greatly. The men had nothing to say, but the women were pitiful. Their families only knew that they could go back at 7:00 or 8:00 PM. They couldn't leave until their work was done. The anxiety in their hearts and the cold wind after the rain tormented them. They couldn't help but cry with resentment. It was so late, and they couldn't call a car. The company's gate was locked like a prison. They truly felt like they couldn't fly away even with wings. The thinner their clothes, the more their limbs trembled. Their stomachs were also empty. They were truly suffering from hunger and cold. The male extras took off their coats and put them on the women. But their stomachs were still unfed. They suffered for a night and half a day. The price they paid was only $1.20 (for women) and $1.00 (for men).</p>
<h3>THE BEAUTIFUL DANCES OF THE ANN SUMMERS STUDIOS DANCE SCHOOL</h3>
<p>Ann Summers Studios Dance School, founded in 1927, is the leading dance school in Shanghai. It holds a beautiful dance (Nick Nax) performance once a year. This year, it is scheduled for November 9th, 10th, and 11th at the Summer Peacock Theater on Jing'an Temple Road. The image on the left is the dance posture of Ms. Xie Meizhen of the school.</p>
<p>FILM TREATISE</p>
<h3>THE AMERICAN METHOD OF MANUFACTURING STARS</h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>The term "star" was originally borrowed by people in the arts in Europe and the United States to describe an outstanding actor, speaker, or socialite. In Western theaters, calling someone a "star" is like calling them a "pillar" or "major performer" in Chinese theaters. Have you ever seen a large five-pointed star drawn on the door of a backstage dressing room in an American film? The words "Star Room" are written on the door of this dressing room. Without outstanding artistic cultivation, one cannot naturally enter this star room to be the protagonist.</p>
<p>Film is the most developed in the United States. The psychology of worshiping stars naturally pushes Americans to be number one. Because they want to attract public attention to these stars, they do not hesitate to sacrifice a large amount of advertising fees. They deliberately instruct these stars to create a little commotion in social circles and all lively occasions, so that these newspapers that receive huge advertising fees can publish the news in special large print, indirectly allowing the theaters showing their films to be crowded with people every performance.</p>
<p>Originally, the psychology of the masses, like that of civilized and barbaric societies, is to worship great heroes and great men. However, in American society, which lacks internal turmoil and external troubles, how can one easily establish extraordinary achievements or create great undertakings? Americans use this defect, using thousands of candles' worth of automatic electric lights to dazzle the large but empty star signboard, shifting the masses' psychology of worshiping heroes to worshiping stars. However, there are too many film companies in the United States. How can the stage and schools produce so many stars? Therefore, the jokes about manufacturing stars emerge one after another. Mary Pickford became famous, so village girls whose appearance and posture were slightly similar to Mary were invited to the city by film company representatives who came from thousands of miles away and were forced to play the lead role in a film.</p>

<p>READER'S SPRING AND AUTUMN</p>
<h3>TALKING ABOUT "SUNSHINE SUSIE"</h3>
<p>In the past, British films generally gave us a bad impression. Their aristocratic expressions and many meaningless dialogues were truly boring. Who would have thought that this film, Sunshine Susie, would be a big exception?</p>
<p>When I walked into the Carlton Theater, knowing that it was a British film, I felt a inexplicable sense of loss in my heart. But when I walked out of that door after the show, I felt an unsurpassed pleasure and satisfaction.</p>
<p>The plot is very ordinary, a purely American-style love story. But the director was able to perform it with extreme enthusiasm, as if giving the audience a cup of rich coffee.</p>
<p>The actors are rarely seen by us, but their wonderful performances can be said to be "a blockbuster." Renate Muller and Jack Holbert are light and delicate, and can be chased after by Irene Dunne and McDonald. Everything in this film follows the same path as several famous "Scandal" films.</p>
<p>The appearance of each actor is under extremely natural conditions, avoiding the common European film problem of being far-fetched. Whenever there are some calmer scenes, appropriate interpolations are used, which are humorous and touching. The whole film consistently uses low-pitched music, and whenever there is a small opportunity, songs are used to represent dialogue. What is not slightly let go of is the sound of trains typing and other machines, which are also matched into a beautiful rhythm.</p>
<p>Even so, several actors have not detached themselves from the flavor of European continental opera. Of course, this flavor is extremely exciting. If we talk about the film in general, it is indeed similar to "Monte Carlo" in some ways, and it has all the scenery, performance, rhythm, and songs of "Monte Carlo," only the plot is different.</p>
<h3>Irrespective of Age</h3>
<p>— Ai</p>
<p>In Hollywood, age is not a concern. Marie Dressler is already sixty years old. But in 1932, she was elected queen! The reputation and welcome she enjoyed surpassed any young woman's wildest dreams. John Barrymore is fifty-one years old this year. Not only is he still regarded as a major star, but he also often plays young lovers. He is even more popular than younger stars. There is also a Chio Sale, whose face is beautiful and who is not yet thirty years old. Yet her success lies in her portrayal of white-haired old women. Dorothy Petrems is only in her prime, but she permanently plays older mothers. Few people can notice her youthful beauty.</p>

<h3>Income Tax of Hollywood Stars</h3>
<p>— Mei Cun</p>
<p>The income tax for Hollywood stars has been revised this year with a new tax rate, roughly more than double what it was last year. Consequently, most stars feel uneasy, especially foreign stars, who, in addition to paying taxes in Hollywood, also have to bear the tax burden of their home countries. For example, Charlie Chaplin has to pay income tax to his home country (England), which amounts to 25% of his total annual income. Maurice Chevalier also has to pay a similar amount to France.</p>
<p>Big star John Gilbert makes two films a year, earning US$500,000. He also has other considerable income. Last year, he paid 20% of his total income in taxes. However, this year he has to pay US$263,710 (52.7% of his total salary)—how significant!</p>
<p>Will Rogers' salary is US$450,000 per year, and he also has a considerable additional income. Although we cannot accurately estimate his total annual income, his income tax certainly accounts for more than 50% of his income. Charlie Chaplin's film "City Lights" has already grossed more than US$3 million. Calculated at an income tax rate of 57.12%, this number is quite staggering.</p>
<p>Ann Harding made four films this year, with a fee of US$80,000 per film. Her income tax this year, calculated at 46%, requires her to pay more than US$147,000 in taxes. In next year's contract, she can earn a fee of US$100,000 per film, so her income tax will also increase to more than US$180,000.</p>
<p>Ruth Chatterton and William Powell signed a two-year contract with Warner Bros. They will make three films in the first year at US$100,000 per film, and three films in the second year, increasing to US$125,000 per film. Therefore, their income tax next year will be more than US$170,000 each.</p>
<p>Tallulah Bankhead, Maurice Chevalier, Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Buster Keaton, and others have salaries between US$200,000 and US$300,000. The income tax they have to pay is approximately between 40% and 45%, which is also around US$100,000.</p>
