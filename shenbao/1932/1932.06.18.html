<h3 id="c1">東北問題究將如何彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自東北禍變發生。政府不以自力衛國守土。始則靜候國聯之解决。繼則坐俟國聯調查團之調查。遷延迄今。東北之淪亡已歷時九月。今調查團亦已調查完竣。將從事編製報告矣。吾人嘗傳聞調查團中有人云。［解决東北問題之困難。不在中國而在日本。］此即明指日本有侵略之决心。而吾國當局漠視東北問題之謂也。又云。［根據目前東北情况擇一可通行之辦法。以謀解决。］此所謂［可通行之辦法。］其無利於我。蓋可斷言。前此國聯三次决議日本均置之不理。就令此次調查團眞有公正之解决辦法。果能束縛日本之行動。轉移日本之一貫的大陸政策乎。故國聯將來未能解决此一問題。固無足怪。獨是我政府喪失半壁山河與三千萬人民。而遷延迄今。不僅未見其實踐出兵收回失地討伐僞國之宣言。抑且似將此國家生死關頭之東北問題而漸忘之。熙熙攘攘但知酣於權勢之爭競。祿位之攫取。此則事之至堪怪異而令吾人悲憤莫能自己者也。</p>
<p>當禍變發生之初。東北雖以不抵抗而爲强力所刦持。然而遼寗設有臨時省政府於錦縣。吉林亦設有臨時省政府於賓縣。以示不屈今則除馬占山將軍尙能以黑省主席之資格。努力奮鬥。及東北各地自動奮起之義勇軍。艱苦搏戰而外。遼吉之省府人員。早已不知所往矣。此非自爲放棄消滅乎。負有直接責任之東北長官。亦早已置此一奇恥大辱於腦後。而沉湎於歌舞逸樂矣。嗚呼。國家之法紀何在彼誤我國家負我人民者。固將何以自解乎。</p>
<p>今日本軍人第一幕。旣已手創僞國第二幕且擬正式予以形式上之承認。則其第三幕演出合併僞國之悲劇。自爲勢所必然我政府旣未能奮起收回失地。拯救處於水深火熱下之三千萬同胞。我國人則又被壓抑於不抵抗之政策下。不能自起抗爭。舉國上下。長怯者苟安積極者亦徒有悲憤。嗚呼。我東北半壁山河。其遂長此變易其顔色乎。</p>
<p>目前廬山會議之後。據政府當局之表示。謂對外已有整個計劃。吾人誠不敢斷言此所謂整個計劃。又爲空談然而回憶曩昔政府决以武力收回失地討伐僞國。决不負國家負人民之昭示之迄未實踐。則吾人深盼此次之所謂整個計劃。不徒爲口頭上之宣傳。而能見諸事實。今日山海關頭之飄揚。者已爲僞國國旗。山海關車站之巡邏者。亦皆僞國國警。顧維鈞氏此次返自東北。飽受刺激。迭發沉痛之談話。與九一八以來吾人所號呼者。恰爲同調。語之悲憤。令人泣血。吾人但一引領東北。但一默念東北三千萬之同胞。則前此政府所昭示之收復失地討伐僞國决不容再遷延也。</p>
<p>吾人今敢重述吾人在九一八事變之初之一貫主張。再爲當局告。一曰自力保全領土完整。二曰長期抵抗。三曰剷除東北歷來受日本政治經濟侵略之一切禍根。四曰通緝溥儀等一羣國奸此非高調。實與政府曩昔宣示［武力收回失地］［討伐僞國］［决不簽訂喪權辱國之條約］同一目標。政府諸公。保持我民族立國之精神。聽取人民之要求。此其時矣。</p>

<p>昨開首次全體大會</p>
<p>主席以五大國名義朗讀宣言</p>
<p>聲明到期債欵暫行保留交付</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯社十七日洛桑電舉世矚目之洛桑會議、已於今晨入於活躍階段、全體大會於今晨十時十五分舉行第一次會議、一般人士對於洛桑會議之結果、企望甚殷、今晨開會之始、即由大會主席英首相麥唐納以英·法·比·意·日諸國名義、作一極重要之宣言、其内容如下、</p>
<p>［署名各政府鑒於經濟財政危及全世界、情勢迫切、深信目下提出之各種問題、須予以最後並精確之解决辦法、以便改善歐洲之局勢、並深信此種解决辦法、宜即時尋覓而不容間斷、以期在全世界清算之範圍内、求其實現、又鑒於若干項賠欵及戰債、將於本年七月到期、以爲大會在最短時期之内、應商得結果、所有因賠償及戰債而對與會各國所欠之債欵、當大會進行之時、其交付應暫行保留、惟在市塲上發行之普通債務、不受此種决定之影響、署名各政府宣言各該國方面、準備即照此項商定辦法進行、並請其他債權國政府採取同一態度、一九三二年六月十六日在洛桑簽字、大不列顚及北愛爾蘭代表張伯倫、法國代表赫禮歐、比國代表倫金、意大利代表格蘭弟、日本代表吉田、］</p>
<p>▲國民社十七日洛桑電、麥唐納宣讀畢、采聲雷動、德總理巴本即起作簡短演說、歡迎此宣言書、稱爲簽字五國决意便利會議工作、以期獲得一偉大切實解决之第一證明、渠切望其他有關係各國亦將瞭解此宣言意義云云、按五國宣言與德國聲明、雖俱未明言美國、實均暗指美政府在内、巴本言畢、乃請新聞記者退席、改開秘密會議、討論暫行停付一切賠欵計劃、</p>
<h3 id="c75">巴本申述德國地位 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>措辭委婉而得體</p>
<p>按今日大會首由德總理開始討論、巴本操純熟法語、暢陳德國經濟財政情形、略謂德國固不願思正式抛棄曩年所接受之財政義務、但今有一事、實即時過境異、此種義務已與此中種種事實、不復有些微相應合、而應付此種實在情形、不僅在德國、即在全世界亦屬極端重要、當海牙會議時、世界仍充滿樂觀、但自此會議以後、樂觀漸易爲悲觀、甚且改變爲失望、今日吾人環顧世界、祇見失業激增、各國已被迫承認無力應付外債、資本與存放欵項逐見緊縮、再加以金價飛騰、物價慘跌、此種現象、皆供给吾人戰債賠欵急須重加整理之明證、嗣遂評論政治債欵與黄金分佈及物品交換之連鎖情形、及黄金存額與國外貿易出入超之關係、鄭重聲稱、目前世界危局之主要原因、必須於不合經濟原理之政治付欵制度中求之、繼乃轉述德國内政、謂國際清償銀行顧問委員會去年十二月已宣稱、德國捐稅已達最重限度、但德國新舊政府雖鑒於此種宣言、但爲維持國家機械之運用免其崩壞計、仍不得不甘冒全國破産之險、對於久苦重負之人民加徵新稅、今時局更見危難、失業民衆革命思想之長足進展、及德意志銀行外幣存額之日减、此種不之祥兆、必須以任何犧牲力遏其發展、胡佛停付計劃雖畀德人稍紓喘息、顧仍不充份、其後國際專家雖有建議、未獲相當考慮、良可遺憾、嗣乃力闢外間所稱取消賠欵後、德國將成爲世界市塲可怖競爭者之妄力言德國所借私人外債須付重利息、即令解除政治債務後、仍足以削弱其商市競爭力、最後聲稱、德國迭經試騐後、業已顯然證明賠欵之償付之能繼續、今以因其不僅有顯明之暗示、且已證明亦足以損害其餘之世界、余意即令再作試騐亦將毫無實際價値、因其必遭失敗、不特龜蓍、今用暫時展期及稍紓喘息方法以謀、解决之時期、業已過去、本會之工作、乃在清理已往種種開啓今後積極合作之途、蓋唯有此舉、方能引導吾輩入於光明前途云云、</p>
<h3 id="c76">不列顚準備大犧牲 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>▲路透社十七日洛桑電今日會議中巴本演說後、英財政大臣張伯倫即起致詞、謂渠今代表不列顚全體人民聲明、英國雖負擔綦重、但準備在總勾銷中佔一部分、惟須有關係之各政府均參加此項行動、此舉將迫令大不列顚犧牲約二百比英、（Ｂillion）金鎊、（按一比英依法美計算法、爲一·○○○·○○○、○○○依英德計算法、爲一·○○○·○○○·○○○·○○○、則二百比英當有二○○·○○○·○○○·○○○·○○○·之多、未知孰是、○此爲英國應付戰債與所收賠欵相差之數、惟英國人民現覺唯取此澈底之計畫、始能恢復信用云、</p>
<h3 id="c77">英法商定停付計劃 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>▲國民社十七日巴黎電、今晨巴黎晨報載極可靠消息、法總理赫禮歐與英相麥唐納對于賠欵問題、已試行商定不僅可延長胡佛停付計劃時期、且對於一切有條件與無條件賠欵、均可無定期停付、至其最後解决、則須俟至關於取消一切戰債問題可與美國商得某種協定之時、據稱、此項試行協定辦法、將繕製一决議案提出會議、昨日英相麥唐納與德總理巴本相晤時、曾力勸巴本勉從此議、放棄德國所持賠欵問題必須立即解决之主張、又今晨巴黎廻聲報載著名國家主義派新聞記者潘蒂那克士評論反對此計劃、力持消滅有條件與無條件賠欵界限妨碍法人利益之說、以爲洛桑會議不妨休會之後時時開會、直至十一月再行結束俾可一面與美國談判獲得充分進展、以便修改楊格計劃、</p>
<h3 id="c78">英相切望歐美合作 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>▲路透社十七日洛桑電英相麥唐納昨日開會時之言論、使人發生取銷戰債其期尙遠之印象、英相之言涉及美國者、尤爲動人其言曰、今有一大機會、現於吾人之前、可使吾人互相携手、以制止現造成全世界經濟凋敝之影響、歐洲不能單獨行動、美國已使吾人抱一種信心、以爲在現狀過去後、美國可與吾人合作、至少研究若干更大難題、而共同籌擬振興貿易致富國家之政策、此等保證、乃吾人全體所必引爲欣幸者也云、</p>
<h3 id="c79">解决戰債三項辦法 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>大會現所遇者、有三種不同之主要辦法、（一）大會能協定一致取銷賠欵、與戰債歟（二）大會能協定以百分比爲根據、裁减賠欵與戰債歟、（三）大會能協定展長六月三十日到期之國際政府債欵緩付期、而將總解决辦法延至他日爲之歟、據一般推測、最可實現者、殆上述之第三種辦法、惟無論有何發展、英國終處於極不能使人羡慕之地位、在任何决定之下、英國終不免於有所喪失、此乃無可疑者、美國現僅以旁聲資格列席大會、但有可注意者、美國現漸有一種輿情、主張完全取銷、而不願用稍减賠欵與戰債之政策、徒延長痛苦、英相麥唐納發言後、大會即略辦例行事件、旋休會、定今日再集會、</p>
<h3 id="c80">法德總揆談判和洽 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>▲國民社十六日洛桑電今日下午英·德·法·意·比·日·六大國首席代表、在杜·沙都旅館開秘密會議、僅歷二十分鐘而畢、當經决定明日上午起開始一般的討論、由德總理巴本首先演說、繼以法總理赫禮歐·英代表張伯倫·意外相格蘭第依次陳述意見、秘密會議後、巴本立即訪赫禮歐談話一小時、聞兩人係對於德國内政情形、及會議中各問題交換意見、雙方談話極具友好精神、且亦和洽、嗣巴本即訪英相麥唐納、繼又與赫禮歐密談一小時以上、巴本擅英法言語、三人間談話可以暢言心曲毫無隔閡之處不必用譯人爲介、此亦一大便利處、外傳巴本與赫禮歐第二次相晤時、意見互異、赫氏略有激烈語之說、業由當局切實否認、謂德法總理兩次會晤時、語調始終友好、法總理曾對於會晤結果表示滿意、並稱足見兩方俱有善意云、</p>

<p>▲路透社十六日華盛頓電、此間主張解除酒禁者、對於美共和黨大會採取黨綱、贊成以中央管理酒業、代替酒禁一節、表示不滿、稱此乃騎墻派之舉動、殊堪厭惡云、</p>

<p>幣制問題爲將來立一基礎</p>
<p>▲路透十六日倫敦電海外自治地大臣湯姆士、今日在下院略示哇太華英帝國經濟會議所將討論之事件、謂首須討論者爲貿易問題、即甲自治地與乙自治地間應採行何種步驟、始可有益於彼此貿易是、此事當然明白切實引起稅率與帝國優惠待遇之問題、英國許自治地貨物自由輸入英國市塲、此舉大有助於各方面對此問題之好意、其次所須討論者爲英帝國工業合理化及通幣與金融問題、整個幣制問題當然包括在内、任何會議决不能希望於數星期中、解决此種重要複雜事件、但英政府已着手辦理許多初步工作、甚可視爲重要云、湯姆士又稱、英政府將主張設立一種機關、可代表各自治地逐日接洽、而不必待至三年舉行帝國會議、此外尙有一事須考慮者、爲移民問題、移民必擊於自治地繁榮之恢復云、</p>
<p>▲路透十六日哇太華電加拿大現擬俟七月間英帝國經濟會議舉行後、再着手辦理對外新商約、一九二二年加拿大與法國間商約、近已作廢、曾擬締結臨時辦法以代之、但談判不成、故兩國皆將適用完全稅率、加拿大對日本及歐洲南美等十五國之商約、亦皆作廢、須俟哇太華會議後、再定新商約、</p>

<p>朱先生說到這裏，我是有幾分明白了。但是行動産生知識的理論究竟對於我們的學校要發生什麽影響，我還不能推定便打破沙鍋紋（問）到底的向朱先生請敎。朱先生說··［我們這個學校是根本與傳統的學校不同了。傳統的學校是一個鮑魚罐頭公司。學生好一比是一個一個的罐頭。先生好一比是裝罐工人。僞知識便是裝在罐頭裏的臭魚，没有煑熟，没有消毒，令人看了好看，吃了嘔心瀉肚送老命。何能怪人連罐頭一起摔掉呀！可是這個罐頭公司是個老店，掛的是歷代聖賢親筆所寫的招牌。我不要說别人只拿那主張［知行合一］的王陽明的理論來談一談，你便知道傳統學校的根是安得很深了。他說··［知是行之始··行是知之成。］這兩句話是代表了傳統學校的敎育方法。我們在學校裏用十年五年光陰把［知］的功夫做好了再到學校外去［行］。依傳統的方法你要學游水是在課堂裏聽游水的演講，在圖書館裏看游泳的書，到大考的時候，寫一篇游水論得七十分就算及格，得一百分京算你是個游水大王。誰能否認你呢？你的學校是有先知後行的哲學根據，你的考卷是有博士們的雙圈，你的文憑是有敎育部蓋的印子。誰能否認你呀？可是你得留神，海龍王只認本領不認文憑。大達輪船失了火，如果你也是般上的一個搭客，那時可眞是過游水的大考咧。好，傳統學校是必得拆掉。王陽明的［知是行之始］得翻半個觔斗。怎麽呌做半個觔斗呢？孫悟空一個觸觔斗十萬八千里。他是站在如來佛的手掌上翻觔斗，翻好了一個，他還是站着。翻一個觔斗是畫三百六十度，半個觔斗是畫了一百八十度，恰是顚倒了過來。我們的理論應該是這様··</p>
<p>［行是知之始，知是行之成。］</p>
<p>我們是要在行動上追求眞知識。行動遇着困難便不能不思想，思想貫通便取得了眞知識，運用眞知識以行動，便走上了創造之路。今日之學校是行以求知的地方。有行動的勇氣，才有眞知之收穫，才有創造之可能。］</p>

<p>— 芳洲</p>
<p>十九路軍參謀長黄强氏。於此次抗日戰役及停戰會議。運籌帷幄。折衝樽俎。倍極辛勞。最近以十九路軍行將奉調入閩。特來蘇主持一切。蘇州農校廖校長於日前邀之到校演講。幸蒙首肯。黄氏平日本不苟言笑。是日滔滔陳說達兩小時。而妙語如環。寓莊於諧。結果痛陳内戰之害。聞者動容。茲摘錄一二。足當快人快語之稱也。</p>
<p>黄氏自述其歷史云。十六歲畢業於法文學校。十八歲任滇越鐵路局翻譯員。因憤法人之無理。棄而入粤習陸軍。後又北上卒業於保定軍官學校。復回粤任下級軍官。參預討袁之役。嗣後因政變亡命海外。在法國習農業工業。在英國習航空。回國後歷任工業學校校長。並辦養蜂塲養鷄塲農塲等。結果均以受内戰影響而失敗。然百折不撓。從未灰心。其後開發瓊崖。具有遠大計劃。於二十個月中已得不少成績。亦以政變而功虧一簣。故本人從事社會服務垂三十年。治軍亦二十年。若以同業公會之例。計所經歷。則農工兵敎育各界均可加入。然至今仍不得不穿此一身武裝。未能在工農兩界覓一位置者。皆因内戰之影響也。</p>
<p>又云内戰之結果。致成今日貧弱之現象。悉索敝賦。以供軍費。而國内除土匪猖獗外。軍行所至。亦多擾民。故匪區及受兵災之處。可以成語數句以形容之。即『鷄犬不驚。路不拾遺。夜不閉户。』何以言之。蓋匪來如梳。兵來如　。犬已盡。當然不驚。廬舍爲墟。無遺可拾。室無長物。不必閉户矣。且軍需浩繁。則必取之於苛捐雜稅。於是田畝盡種罌粟。幾成花國。又如鄕人擔貨入城求售者。在鄕則有貨物稅。入城則有落地捐。過學校之門而有敎育捐。過警局之門而有公安捐。過保衛團之門而有地方保衛捐。層層剥削。終使其人棄貨而逃始已。故今日中國之事。非不可爲。祇須停止内戰。使民富庶。然後施以敎化。本人當年駐瓊崖時。先以四個月之時期肅清共匪。復進行築路墾荒。最後清查户口。實施保甲之法。年餘而瓊大治。每於休沐日單騎出游。作執一途人而問以姓名籍貫住所等等。即以隨帶之該鄕名册覆按之。如所言不實。即係形跡可疑。來歷不明矣。竟能做到眞實的路不拾遺。夜不閉户。故爲政不貴多言。能認清目標。埋頭做去。必有成績可得。在瓊崖二十個月。固始終未貼一紙標語也。</p>
<p>黄氏末復鄭重聲言因感覺内戰之害。故今後十九路軍對内决不妄發一顆子彈。對外則剩一兵一卒。亦必抵抗到底云</p>

<p>光緒庚子辛丑間。師任麗水學官處郡城二年餘。時余年未冠也。丙午自杭州來。慈溪謁師於里第。壬申三月清明。與其家人拜師墓於慈湖西北隅。宿草已離離矣。回憶三十年來。恍如夢寐。低徊俯仰。不自知涕之何從也。得詩云。三十年前事。一一上心來。我年十五六。曾拂玉階苔。徘徊杜老齋。日上吳公臺。掩户抄詩文。那識材不材。抄畢懷之去。師知無疑猜。有時顧我笑。此子心尙孩。别後將十年。游學以老槐。（師住慈溪槐花樹門頭門有老槐）從此風雨夕。虛室常追陪。三日不相見。便將詩句催。每言悽惘中。笑口爲汝開。自愧羊公鶴。徒伴嚝世才。忽忽三十年。昔孩今已　。去年我方病。聞師夢蛇虺。力疾浮海至。一面萬念灰。臨别握我手。相見能幾回。忍淚不敢落。爲言無後災。别後十一月。巖巖泰山　。千夫不可贖。一棺埋山限。璇璣與玉衡。萬古委蒿萊。今日拜墓門。靈風拂酒杯。已行却回顧。掩袂有餘哀。（不受酬）</p>

<p>上海友聲旅行團。成立有年。内分國樂·國技·藝術·國音·圖書館·旅行等小組。其中以圖書館爲靜的推進大衆文化。以旅行爲動的研究自然科學。十二日爲旅行組游覽崇島之期。是日陰霾四合。大雨如注。然仍冒雨前往。茲撮記當日景况。以誌鴻爪。</p>
<p>▲船上佈置賃大輪一艘。可容納五百餘人。因雨未到者有之。臨時加入者亦有之。總計約三百人。船上佈置。頗爲壯觀。船頂高豎友聲團徽大旗兩面。船身右側平行間隔分懸白地黑字油漆光亮直徑三尺之圓鉛牌十一隻。上書字云。［友聲旅行團直放崇明專輪。］船爲三層。上下左右。交互遍貼［少年旅行助敎育。壯年旅行增閱歷［。與［旅行爲求知方法。求知促民旅進化］等語。蓋已爲該團之座右銘矣。</p>
<p>▲滬瀛海景聞邵臥雲先生云。［崇明島古名瀛洲。吾等由上海直駛崇明凡經浦濱及海道一路之景色。在在足觀。所惜刦餘之吳淞破碎不堪。觸目驚心耳。雖以陰雨無常。然亦大飽眼福。浦江各國軍艦輪船。不下百數十艘。首尾啣接。藴藻浜中。俗稱水上黄包車之帆船無數。均於竿上高繫三角形紅布。再回首浦東。則綠野盈眸。尤助游興。輪越三峽水突見波濤洶湧。海天茫茫。又是一幅天然圖畫矣。輪泊崇明島。遙望對岸之海門野景。雲霧迷濛隱約可辨。前有漁船數十隻。如點水蜻蜓輕輕舞。洎乎泝流返掉。輪愈遠。島愈小。又如金蟬游龍活潑潑地知人意而歡送吾輩者。繼而雲散天霽。彩雲紛飛約四小時。泛泛入浦江。至高境廟軍工路附近。海上燈燦爛。洸入蜃樓海市。凡此種種。皆不可多得之水鄕風景也。</p>

<p>— 鏡清</p>
<p>海上塵囂。殊足損年。以是耈老。實不多靚。聞蜀省之開縣。有老人李青雲者。已屆二百六十餘齡。確屬事實。可稱寰宇壽翁之巨擘。與滬上名律師譚某。有葭莩之親。不佞曾以友人之馳函紹介。蒙贈壽翁照相一幀。指甲長逾尺許。廣額無鬚。雙目炯炯。的係壽者相。聞是翁業擅韓康。於古稀歲。登山。曾在無意中。啖某種藥草。頓覺體魄健爽逾恒。以臻今日云云。但恨未得其詳。姑談相老人攝生。</p>
<p>相老無嗜欲之煩。室家之擾。起居飲啖。全依科學上的規則。對於中國舊式養生法。及昔時鄭陶齋等學說。素持反對。但與大隈重信。及伍秩庸之攝衛。亦迴異。伍及大隈。生前向以皕歲自豪。徒貽夸語。</p>
<p>相老人居恒不食粥飯。每日三餐。止食牛乳。半生熟鷄卵。（或鴿卵）鷄汁牛肉汁及少量麵包。咖啡及普通紅燒魚肉等。富於纖維質之蔬菜。則絕對不啖。以其有碍高年人胃壁。艱於消化也。對於國産補品。僅偶然服食肉桂油銀耳等。雖間飲參湯。但並不認爲需要之物。每餐祇飲少量之酒。或兼服消化片。午晚二餐。必間食各類水菓二三枚。以助消化。水菓中尤喜檬菓蘋菓蜜橘梨等。牛乳中每切斷香蕉和而食之。餐後必漱口。刷齒。隨飲檸檬茶。或瀹茗消膩。平日所喜食者。（實基於生理上之學說）爲蜂蜜葱韮蒜及野百合等。</p>
<p>相老人曾謂猶太古時多高壽者。以其常啖蜂蜜葱蒜等物之故。邇來西醫咸主常食大葱。韮蒜等物。可以壯健身體。對於於體虛衰弱者尤宜。即以北方人與南人相比。亦多數較爲壯健。可爲引證。相老又謂高加索人。多壽逾期頣者。以其常啖乳酸餅。足以消滅有害之大腸菌。得以延年。對於粤人之食蛇肉。稱其頗合學理。可治皮膚病。以其有排除。體内穢質之力。如近代流行之靜坐法。雖深加贊許。但未見實行云。</p>
<p>相老人每晚九時左右。即熄燈而睡。黎明即起。洗潄整衣。即赴聖堂誦經。望彌撒。習以爲常。在嚴寒時。雖天尙黝黑。亦必準時早起。無非爲赴堂誦經故。以此塵慮滌盡。天君泰然。抑爲克享遐齡之一大原因。惟自倭寇猖獗以來。偕亡之痛。每溢言表。具徵老成謀國。棖觸深矣。</p>
<p>停午餐後。常寢臥一二時。以養息精神而助消化。所居爲三樓。陽光與空氣均感佳暢。樓臨綠野。可紓眼力。九峯在望。烟景宜人。憑欄挹翠。美意延年。户　等處。均籠以碧紗。以阻蚊蠅。在炎夏每日必浴。無論已。雖在寒冬。亦必三日一浴。平居則如楊鐵崖之晚年不下樓。絕少運動。（某醫師談相老人如壯歲後能注意運動體力當更壯健）坐擁書城。手不釋卷。樂道好學。殊覺望塵莫及已。</p>

<p>— 金俊仁</p>
<p>青島水族館。建於海濱公園中段。面向大海。背臨道路。外爲城垣式。富麗堂皇。綦壯觀瞻。遊覽者。須購門票一角。中爲一露天庭院。有噴水池二。噴珠濺玉。至饒趣味。兩旁則各水類之陳列處。表以玻璃。内貯水石沙草等。形同商店之玻璃窗。每窗之内。各置水中動物一二種。或三四種。海星。比目魚。爲人所鮮見者。故最惹人駐足。海星之狀。若菱角焉。有五角。藍地上著金白等色花點。頗美麗可觀。惟觀者迺弗能辨其口睛。位置何處。以其形爲圓形。呆拙不動故也。比目魚爲橢圓形。惟吾人苟粗視之。則僅一片薄紙。浮沉上下。不見有其他體類也。兩旁各水族陳列處之極端。則爲一大玻璃室。内藏一老蛟。身長近丈。想其生存水中。當能興波作浪。兇猛罕儔也。另有一室。則爲各水類之標本。珊瑚之類最多名式各異。按水族館之設。吾國殆爲創。見。聞所費頗不貲。海濱公園中。有此建設。遊人將愈益增多矣。</p>

<p>梁笑雲也停止了這些細緻矯揉的動作。只拉著安玉田另談正經的道。你簡直不要再擔心了。承啓處那般東西。你别要看他們擺著軍官架子。一個個全像個人樣。其實究是些極下賤的當差的胚。只不過想找人討一些錢。有錢就買得他們動。你想著要堂而皇之經過他們那裏去見老葉。原也是對的。但旣須打從他們手下過。要他們乖乖的替你跑狗腿遞片子。這點像是門包的運動費。本就萬不能省。不如爽爽快快賞給他們。落一個有面子。何犯著冒冒失失。的闖了去。讓他們瞧不起。我剛才所以埋怨你的。原就爲的是不願意你白受他們一頓糟踐呀。如今旣已這樣。更得把這面子十足的要回來。不免比平常多加他們一點數目。也就完啦。明天我自會把小毛呌了來。命他替你去辦。妥後。包你下回去就决不是那種臉子。花點錢自有値得的所在。并不是何等情理以外的怪事。比如我們家裏的男女聽差。誰不想找外快。賺零錢。我們若到别家公館去應酬。也須常開發一點賞號。不過地位和勢力有大小之分。承啓官仗著督軍的威風大。要的多一些。討得凶一些罷了。我們體諒人情。須從流俗。自當隨和些。漂亮些。落得讓他們這種底下人歡喜歡喜。古人說得好。小不忍則亂大謀。做大事也是不能惜小費的呀。這一席話。說得安玉田大爲佩服。自然就不再介意。到第二天。毛德順接著電話來到。梁笑雲便反這件事完全托他去疏通。也又就是煩他去送禮。撕下兩張銀行支票。一張開著四百元。一張開著二百元。交與毛德順道。這四百元單送與萬處長。那二百元也托萬處長分發給承啓處一般人。小意思。請他們各位聊嗑一杯茶。以後安參議去見督軍。總拜托他們多帮忙照應點。我一到此地。本就和安參議說起過。要送他們這一份規矩錢的。只因這兩天忙著陪五太太打牌。躭誤下了。</p>

<p>▲滬北昨日新閘蘇州河下到頭念三四號、早間開盤上落有限、錫宜之貨頂定、次疲角許、薄稻貨雖無多、價照原盤、變陰元市無榮辱、洋米又到一輪、約有五萬之譜、客胃勒價略取、本街呆木、致價逐萎、</p>

<p>▲存米已近二萬包···洋米銷呆···續小近角</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况本客進胃均淡、而存米充實、定貨尙多、市上洋商復有期貨兜賣、雖無新交易繼續成議、而市面與人心均被帶落、回籠貨市價亦低、亦無進户問訊、因此現貨續小近角、昨祇内地辦去紅大絞米二百餘包、價九元四角半、鄉莊本街辦進小絞一千包、價十元零二角至十元零零五分、其他統無成交、温州米日前去化甚佳、隨到隨銷、市上並無存積近日商到頭逐有、去化呆木、昨日又到一批、全市已有存貨二萬相近、昨日祇由本街辦去三百四十包、價乃跌進十元大　、祇開九元七角云、</p>

<h3 id="c163">海州港埠變遷 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>▲廢棄大埔趕築墟溝</p>
<p>海州爲隴海鐵路焦點、近年上海開行海州班輪以後、西北貨物之運入東南者、不經漢口與徐州南京、而均改由海州裝來、海州商埠之運輸地、以大埔爲主要港、車輪均集斯處、無如海港變遷、近來大埔吃水、異常淺落、商船時遭失事、妨害貨物運輸、路局爲發展業務便利運輸計、已另在東北别闢新港、車站輪埠均將建就、兩個月後即可實行、亟將此事詳情、查報如下、</p>
<p>▲海州航運盛興海州自闢港以來、隴海路貨物、可從該埠轉運至滬、大埔爲車輪聯絡之點、滬上輪局之與隴海路訂有聯運特約者、計有招商·大振·兩家、共派同華·泳平·泳安·三輪行駛之、而合衆公司亦派徐州·鄭州·各輪、往來滬海、滬戰時此路亦均停航、今已恢復原狀、來貨以雜糧油荳水烟等爲主、去貨以洋雜貨糖布紙烟等爲大宗、</p>
<p>▲大埔水綫難航大埔爲海州之唯一港埠、上海往該處約四百十海哩、隴海路特設鐵道運裝物貨、各輪碼頭亦悉在該港、以便於上下貨件、唯水勢漲落不一、在夏令最淺之際、祇有四五英尺、故商輪時有擱淺及失事等發生、即漲潮時、亦不過裝載五六百噸貨物、多則難行、因之航界深感不便、</p>
<p>▲墟溝開築新港隴海路路局、鑒於大埔之不能發展事業、决另謀開闢一新港、以利運輸、勘騐結果、在大埔東北約四十五海哩、有一灣進海港、地名墟溝、吃水甚深、最合海輪停抛、凡四五千噸重儎、亦可出入自如、昔年路局本有將墟溝開闢商埠之意、曾請德工程師估計、謂須二千萬元、方能造成港岸、事乃中止、今則决計在墟溝建築鐵道、增造棧房、並挖深海港、供輪碇泊、各項工程、業在趕造中、</p>
<p>▲秋間可以實現墟溝新港造就、路局即將大埔鐵路拆去、以後輪船碼頭、亦移到新港、大埔港完全放棄不用、茲因車站路軌貨棧、均將次竣工、而財部亦在該處建造海關一所、爲徵進出口貨之關稅、在本年八月、可望全部完工、惟輪船碼頭因海港尙未造駁岸、屆時祇可抛泊港面、貨件等用船駁裝、二月以後、海州新港、便可實現告成矣、</p>

<p>— 警愚</p>
<p>空氣之中，有無量數的微生物繁殖其間，食物如魚肉之類，歷時稍久，即爲其侵蝕而致腐敗，是以欲免此病，非用罐藏之法不可。</p>
<p>藏物於罐，就是市上所售的罐頭食物，因爲罐頭食物是用科學的方法，製造成功，罐内的空氣與一切微生物，取締得纖微無餘，所以能保持久遠，永不變壞，可是這種罐頭食物公司，在上海一隅，雖說是多如林立，但具製造之法，全恃機械，非家庭中所易倣效，故欲出外旅行，而便舟車携帶起見，祇有向市上購買各公司的産品，不過各公司的各種産品，是千篇一律的，這已是一種缺憾，况且它們的出品中，不能像家常菜之應有盡有，色色俱備，此尤難滿足一般講究飲食者的口腹之慾。現有一自製之法，早經實騐，成績絕佳，讀者倘能踵而行之，則日常喜吃的餚饌，無難携以隨行，即使遠適異國，家鄕風味，仍可快我朶頣，那麽雖處客地，無異故園，何樂而不爲呢，茲特揭載如下，請嘗試之。</p>
<p>購來的罐頭食物，食後弗將罐頭抛棄，等到積貯多了，逐一將其洗凈，更把水漬矖乾，罐面如已破碎，則另覓洋鐵皮，按照罐頭口徑的大小，剪裁適度，等到你將愛吃的東西烹好后，一一裝入罐中，把罐面加上，用錫封固，然後再將罐頭裝入鍋中，鍋内加水及罐之半，而用烈火煑之，約半句鐘，使罐内之物成沸，發爲蒸汽，將罐取出，用鑽在罐面鑽一小孔，鑽頭一經拔出，立刻用錫將孔眼堵住，至是則手續已備，罐頭食物已告成功，因爲罐面的鐵皮，甫經鑽穿，即聞有聲　然，在此　然一聲的當兒，所有封閉在罐内的空氣，和殘餘的微生物，即被蒸汽排擠而出，一些不留，以此能保持永久，而與機械製成的，同一功效。</p>

<p>許多學生囂張地嚷着，原來上課鐘已敲過了，牛先生丨國文敎員丨的帽頂上，同學們早已把他加上一斬條般的白紙條，而且他又撑上一副老花眼鏡，穿着老竹布長衫，汗珠滿面地走向敎室來，當然摩登化而好事的學生們，安可不發笑呢？</p>
<p>素以狡猾出名的學生陸馬二，看見先生走還未走近的時候，乃大施其神通手段，連忙把那揩黑板布放在半開不開的敎室門上面，預備請老師嘗嘗滋味，　　現在全堂學生都好像吃着安神藥水般的寂靜，無聲地坐着。</p>
<p>牛先生素來是步着秀才步，慢慢地走進來的，但是，今天因他有事遲到了，所以匆匆忙忙地趨前來，不管三七二十一，把門兒推開，那知他高徒的天落撑已打將下來，嚇得老頭兒魂飛魄散，呌道，［喲！］的一聲，老花眼鏡早已可惜成爲粉碎了·牛先生於是大興問罪之師。</p>

<p>［人浮於事］［謀事艱難］這二句，本是生命線上一個最大的難關，一般失業人們，推荐無門，徬徨失所的時候，祇得天天向着報紙上找尋機會，每天的聘請請職員的，徵求合作的，結果仍屬失望，因爲多數要數百元或至數十元保證金來交換職業的，試想貧窮的失業者，豈有這種能力負擔？</p>
<p>敝友張君，亦是失業的一份，這一天他在×大報上看到一段廣告，刋着</p>

<p>茲受各大著名影片公司之委託，招請男女演員數十人，如欲現身銀幕者，不計老幼，祇須粗通文字，每天有五角至一元之代價，機會難逢，報名從速，報名時不收任何費用，報名處××路××里××號，上海××電影社啓</p>
<p>這種不要保證，不收費用的機會，確是千載難逢的，張君很踴躍去加入，誰知所謂××電影社的社址，是××里内的一家灶披問，裏面的人物到是很漂亮幾位洋裝先生，一切佈置，除了一只破舊寫字檯和三四隻木椅，以及牆上用圖畫釘釘着幾張明星照片之外，再找不到一件寳貴東西，他們廣告上明明刋着不收任何費用，加入時倒要繳報名費六角，手續費四角，因爲數目還小，實在謀事艱難，報名的人，多不和他們計較，當時繳清了，到了第三天，果然出發到××大公司去參攝××××一片，每天早上由××公司裏用汽車來載去，晚上載回，伙食槪歸自備的，大約攝了十餘次之後，據社裏的主任說，××公司的片子已經工程完了，請我們暫回家休息二天，侍他把工賬算來發給後，再行攝片，於是我們欣然回家，靜候了二天，再到××電影社去看時，早已鳳去臺空了！</p>

<p>章太太五年前替大兒子娶媳婦時，因爲媳婦嫁來的「妝奩」十分菲薄，所以使她内心極不滿意，爲此屢在人前說話；「費去偌大的金錢，討來一個窮家的婆娘，眞是不上算極哩！」雖然這個大媳婦很會能幹地做事，並且也很孝順着她，可是終究不能得章太太底歡心，就是一般傭婦輩，也竟背地說話；「大奶奶還不是和我們一様的窮？」有的且說··「怪不得太太不喜歡她。」</p>
<p>最近的以前，章太太娶二房媳婦了·不用說，她替兒子訂婚的時候，第一個條件先問「坤宅有錢有勢否？」媒人絕口的稱贊；「女家眞富有，做爺的開二家大當舖，四爿洋貨店，年年賺大錢，幾個舅子都在銀行裏辦事的。」這一來，喜得章太太心花怒放，於是這門親事一撮便合。</p>
<p>那倒不是虛話，且看第二兒子結婚的那天，章家喜氣盈盈，鼓樂喧天，新來媳婦的「妝奩」確是又豐又富，足足裝進三四輛搬塲汽車，一屋子花團錦簇，幾全是些名貴的東西，引得看的人目不暇給，個個艶羨不置，在章太太想來眞覺得有叨天的榮幸了。</p>
<p>二奶奶嫁來後，章太太對之，自然分外的愛悅，平日若上餐館逛戲塲，終是帶着一起走，然而那大奶奶呢？却永是不能享到這恩寵，但她自己很明白；「這是窮家女兒措辦不起豐富「妝奩」所致的緣故。」唉！窮人家女兒出嫁做媳婦，竟有如此說不出底苦痛。</p>

<p>— 圭</p>
<p>在我們學校背後，一條街上，有兩家大餅店，東西對峙，最初它們的營業規模，和做出的大餅，都在同一水平線上。</p>
<p>但是近來的情形却不同了。</p>
<p>甲·近來改良了，增加了許多花樣，猪油的，火腿的，······滋味眞的比以前好得多了，而且拌着紅綠絲的白糖，紅的火腿，綠的葱，白的猪油，放在雪白的盆子裏，陳列在檯上，形式上也增進了不少，營業的發達，一日千里。</p>
<p>乙却依然故我，墨守舊法，原有的顧客，都被甲店吸引去了，不清鮮的大餅，油條，無人顧問，它的老闆，眼巴巴的望着對面的同業，妬忌而又羡慕，　　顯然的，甲因改良而發達，乙因守舊而淘汰。</p>
<p>由小見大，生意之道，都是如此，尤其是處於近代劇烈競爭的商塲中，不可不力求改良呀，</p>

<p>— 水也</p>
<p>在廢歷端陽節的一天，一條水門汀的弄堂裏，充滿着粽子的香味，有許多小孩子的額上，寫着王字，還有許多小孩身上，穿着黄色的老虎衣服，他們臉上現出笑容，因爲這是一個快樂的日子，遠遠地來了兩個×差，身上背着空皮包，站停在一家門口，對着裏面說，「端陽節到了，謝謝你，討兩個酒錢，」裏面的人說，「現在陰曆已經廢除了，爲什麽節上還要討酒錢？」他們兩人就不慌不忙的說，「我們不是廢除陰曆，是維持陰曆而來的，」那主人就給了他們二角洋鈿，一面作爲平日代勞的酬謝，一面就維持那已經廢除的陰曆了。</p>

<h3 id="c222">訶子 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>在前幾天的本刋的文藝欄裏，讀到張公玉的一首咏婦女的竹枝詞，原詩是這樣··</p>
<p>「蟬衣藉臂露酥胸，短髮烏絲屈曲蓬；最是魂消眞彀處，深藏訶子兩高峯。」</p>
<p>「訶子」，這個名詞，似乎有些人不但不懂得它的典故，並且也許不明白它的解釋，於是我來給他考據一下。</p>
<p>原來這典故是出在唐宫遺事上的，事實的大致是這樣··</p>
<p>「楊貴妃與安祿山私通，安誤以爪傷妃之乳，妃泣曰··「吾私汝之過也！」恐帝見之，乃繡胸服掩之，名爲訶子。」</p>
<p>如此說來，訶子是婦女的貼胸繡服，也就是所謂「抹身」，假如以現代裝束相擬，也就是小馬夾一類的作用。</p>
<p>本來婦女的束胸，原是一種陋習，這種習俗，也許是唐之前是没有的？作此俑者，乃是楊貴妃，而楊貴妃之所以爲此，說來也覺可笑，乃是爲的被安祿山抓傷了乳頭，假此以瞞騙明皇的，那末，習俗相沿，此種風氣，竟是在模倣楊妃的勾當，說穿了眞不禁令人忍俊不止。</p>
<p>自從近幾年來，提倡放胸的聲浪一天天的膨漲，小馬夾已被打倒，許多摩登女子，胸際隱露着高聳的雙峯，招搖過市，具着絕大的誘惑性，致使一般道德學者，又在那裏大發其「妖冶誨淫有關風化」的論調了。在下雖是一個極端贊成放胸運動者，但看了那種「肉感的誘惑」，對於大奶的提倡，和服裝的改革，也不禁把來當做有亟待研究的問題。</p>
<p>因篇幅的關係，本文暫且帶住，容有機會時，再另文專論婦女的裝束吧。</p>

<h3 id="e1">How Will the Northeast Problem Ultimately Be Resolved? <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the Northeast Incident occurred, the government has failed to defend the nation and its territory with its own strength. Initially, it passively awaited a resolution from the League of Nations, and then it waited idly for the League of Nations Investigation Commission to conduct its investigation. This dragged on until the Northeast had been lost for nine months. Now, the Investigation Commission has also completed its investigation and will begin compiling its report. We have heard that someone within the Investigation Commission said, "The difficulty in resolving the Northeast problem lies not in China, but in Japan." This clearly indicates that Japan has a determination to invade, while our country's authorities disregard the Northeast problem. It was also said, "Based on the current situation in the Northeast, choose a feasible method to seek a resolution." This so-called "feasible method" is unlikely to benefit us, which can be asserted. Previously, Japan ignored the three resolutions of the League of Nations. Even if this Investigation Commission has a fair resolution, will it be able to restrain Japan's actions and change Japan's consistent mainland policy? Therefore, it is not surprising that the League of Nations will fail to resolve this problem in the future. However, our government has lost half of its territory and 30 million people, and it has dragged on until now. Not only has it failed to fulfill its declaration to send troops to recover the lost territory and suppress the puppet state, but it also seems to be gradually forgetting the Northeast problem, which is a matter of life and death for the nation. They are bustling about, only knowing to indulge in the competition for power and the seizing of official positions. This is extremely strange and fills us with uncontrollable grief and indignation.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the disaster, although the Northeast was seized by force due to non-resistance, temporary provincial governments were established in Jin County for Liaoning and in Bin County for Jilin to show resistance. Now, apart from General Ma Zhanshan, who is still striving hard as the chairman of Heilongjiang Province, and the volunteer armies that have risen up spontaneously in various parts of the Northeast, fighting arduously, the personnel of the provincial governments of Liaoning and Jilin have long disappeared. Isn't this a self-imposed abandonment and destruction? The Northeast officials who bear direct responsibility have also long put this unprecedented shame behind them and indulged in singing, dancing, and leisure. Alas, where is the law and discipline of the nation? How will those who have misled our country and failed our people explain themselves?</p>
<p>Now that the first act of the Japanese military, the creation of the puppet state, has been completed, and they intend to formally recognize it, the third act of staging the tragedy of merging the puppet state is inevitable. Since our government has failed to rise up to recover the lost territory and rescue the 30 million compatriots who are in dire straits, and our people are suppressed by the policy of non-resistance and cannot rise up to resist on their own, the whole country, the cowardly are seeking temporary safety, and the active are only filled with grief and indignation. Alas, will half of our Northeast territory change its color forever?</p>
<p>According to the government authorities' statements after the Lushan Conference, they have a comprehensive plan for foreign affairs. We dare not assert that this so-called comprehensive plan is just empty talk. However, recalling the government's previous declarations to recover the lost territory by force and suppress the puppet state, and its assurances that it would not fail the nation or the people, which have not been fulfilled, we deeply hope that this so-called comprehensive plan will not be just propaganda and will be seen in action. Today, the puppet state's flag is flying over Shanhaiguan Pass, and the patrols at Shanhaiguan Station are all puppet state police. Gu Weijun, who has returned from the Northeast this time, has been deeply affected and has made a series of painful remarks, which are in the same tone as what we have been calling for since the September 18th Incident. His words are so grief-stricken that they make people weep blood. As we think of the Northeast and its 30 million compatriots, the government's previous declarations to recover the lost territory and suppress the puppet state cannot be delayed any longer.</p>
<p>Today, we dare to reiterate our consistent主張 [zhuzhang; position/viewpoint] from the beginning of the September 18th Incident and advise the authorities once again: First, preserve territorial integrity through our own strength; second, resist for a long time; third, eliminate all the roots of the political and economic aggression that the Northeast has suffered from Japan; and fourth, arrest and prosecute Puyi and his group of national traitors. This is not a high-sounding claim, but it shares the same goal as the government's previous declarations to "recover the lost territory by force," "suppress the puppet state," and "never sign treaties that cede rights and humiliate the nation." Government officials, uphold the spirit of our nation's founding and listen to the demands of the people. Now is the time.</p>
<p>National Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Executive Yuan Issues a Declaration to the Outside World Regarding the Japanese Recognition of the Puppet Government <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Recognizing that the Japanese Have Torn Up the League of Nations Covenant and Destroyed the Guarantee of Peace</p>
<p>The People of Our Country Are Determined to Oppose Resolutely at Any Cost</p>
<p>The Japanese Shall Bear Full Responsibility for All Disputes Arising Therefrom</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Japanese parliament's resolution to recognize the puppet Manchurian government, the Executive Yuan issued a declaration to the outside world on the 17th. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>It is reported that the Japanese parliament has resolved to recognize the puppet Manchurian government. The Chinese government is extremely shocked to learn of this. The so-called Manchurian government was established under the duress of Japanese military force, with Japanese advisors controlling real power. It has long been clear to the people of the world that it is a puppet organization created by Japan, and it does not need this recognition to be confirmed. The Chinese government has also repeatedly declared its non-recognition. However, this time, the Japanese government has abandoned its last pretense and blatantly recognized the puppet state. This kind of behavior is not only the most blatant aggression against China, but it also completely tears up the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty, thoroughly destroys the guarantee of peace that the nations of the world have worked so hard to build after the Great War, and deals a fatal blow in spirit to future efforts for world peace. For the sake of self-defense and to fulfill its responsibility as one link in the chain of the world peace organization, the Chinese people are determined to oppose this kind of behavior by the Japanese government resolutely at any cost. The Japanese government, which created and recognized this situation, shall bear full responsibility for all disputes arising from this kind of behavior (Special Dispatch on the 17th).</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues a Declaration Simultaneously <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The Puppet Organization Will Be Dealt With Under the Strictest National Laws</p>
<p>The Japanese Actions Are Considered a Consistent Act of Aggression</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In response to the Japanese parliament's recognition of the puppet organization and its undermining of our sovereignty and independence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a special declaration on the 17th, as follows: The puppet organization in the Eastern Provinces was entirely created by the Japanese government by force. Its real power is indeed controlled by the Japanese. From the leader of the puppet organization, Puyi, down, all rely on the Japanese for their breath and are directed by the Japanese government. From the beginning, Japan and the puppet organization have been one, which has become a universally known and undeniable fact. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated solemnly and formally notified the Japanese government that the puppet organization is a puppet of the Japanese government and that the Japanese government should be responsible for its rebellious acts. The Chinese government will never recognize it. Now, according to reports, various sectors in Japan are strongly urging the government to recognize the puppet organization in the Eastern Provinces as soon as possible, and the Japanese parliament has passed a proposal to that effect. This is simply not enough to hide the illegal facts committed by the Japanese government, and they are attempting to recognize the puppet organization in order to cover the eyes and ears of the world and facilitate the use of the same old trick they used to annex Korea. If the Japanese government follows its request and actually recognizes the puppet organization, it will further prove that its repeated statements in the League of Nations that it has no intention of seizing territory in the Eastern Provinces, and its repeated notifications to the Chinese government that the puppet organization has no relationship with the Japanese government, are completely deceptive words. Its actions of undermining China's sovereignty and independence, as well as the integrity of its territory and administration, violating the Nine-Power Treaty, and disregarding the League of Nations' repeated resolutions, are even more blatant. In addition to dealing with the puppet organization with the strictest national laws, the Chinese government has always considered Japan's previous and subsequent illegal actions in the Eastern Provinces as a consistent act of military aggression. It firmly believes that the signatory countries of the aforementioned treaty, the member states of the League of Nations, and all other countries in the world will not allow Japan or any country to rely on military force to complete its ambition of aggression according to its predetermined steps (Special Dispatch on the 17th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is planning to issue a declaration firmly stating that, in accordance with the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations' past resolutions, Japan should be responsible for respecting China's territorial and administrative integrity, as the Japanese parliament has recently passed a resolution to recognize "Manchukuo" (Reuters Dispatch on the 17th).</p>
<h3 id="e4">Wang Jingwei Issues a Circular Telegram <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Non-Recognition of the Puppet Organization Under Any Circumstances</p>
<p>Determination Not to Cease Efforts to Recover Lost Territory</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Executive Yuan President Wang Zhaoming issued a circular telegram regarding the Japanese parliament's recognition of the puppet state, expressing his stance. The original text is as follows: To all provinces, people's organizations, newspapers, overseas Chinese organizations: It is reported that the Japanese parliament has resolved to recognize the puppet Manchurian government, which shows that Japan has abandoned its last pretense and blatantly recognized the puppet organization it created by military force, tearing up the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty that it signed itself. In addition to declaring its opposition and ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with Japan, the government will adhere to its consistent policy of resolutely resisting and striving to recover the lost territory. However, it is mindful of the terrible changes suffered by our compatriots in the Northeast, whose lives and property are not guaranteed under the various oppressions of the puppet government, and whose spiritual pain is even more difficult to express. Now, upon hearing this bad news, they must be even more concerned about the government's attitude. Therefore, I do not hesitate to reiterate and announce that the government will not recognize the puppet organization under any circumstances, no matter how Japan tries to whitewash it, and will not cease its efforts to recover the lost territory. It is still hoped that the people of the country will maintain their usual spirit, sharpen themselves, endure hardship, unite sincerely, and make various preparations for genuine unity. If the Qin Dynasty had no worthy leaders, there would certainly be a day for recovery. May my countrymen take this to heart. Wang Zhaoming (Special Dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Luo Wengan's Remarks to Visitors <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>This Move by the Japanese Further Reveals Their Ambitions of Aggression</p>
<p>The Policy for Negotiations Regarding the Northeast Is Being Carefully Planned</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan told visitors that the puppet organization in the Northeast is merely a parasite living under the protection of the Japanese. What difference does it make in reality whether it is recognized or not? This move by the Japanese further reveals their ambitions of aggression against Chinese territory and makes all countries in the world fully aware of the overbearing behavior of the Japanese in the international community today. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is constantly and carefully planning the policy for negotiations regarding the Northeast issue. The current government authorities are determined to concentrate their efforts and seek an early resolution to this problem, rescuing 30 million compatriots from dire straits. It is deeply hoped that the whole country will work together with one heart and one mind, prioritizing the Northeast, so that the territory and mountains of the three provinces will ultimately be ours (Telegram on the 17th).</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Japanese Are Conducting Open Lobbying for the Recognition of the Puppet State and Have Publicly Formed a Lobbying Group <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The Puppet State Forms a Girls' Envoy Group</p>
<p>Led by Toyoko Ishida, They Go to Japan</p>
<p>(Beiping) In order to conduct lobbying for the recognition of the puppet state, the Japanese military has formed a lobbying group called the Alliance for the Promotion of the Recognition of Manchukuo. It plans to enter Manchuria in July: the 14th in Dalian, the 16th in Yingkou, the 18th in Fengtian, the 21st in Changchun, the 24th in Jilin, the 27th in Harbin, and return to Japan via Korea on August 2nd (Special Dispatch on the 17th).</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet state has selected two girls each from Manchuria, Japan, and Korea to form a girls' envoy group, which is led by Toyoko Ishida. They arrived in Changchun on the 17th to pay respects to the puppet and will go to Japan on the 18th (Special Dispatch on the 17th).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Komada ordered the puppet state to form a youth league and send representatives to Japan to seek cooperation between Japan and Manchuria (Special Dispatch on the 17th).</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet state's middle school students are being taught the essentials of nation-building to enhance their patriotic thought and to prohibit anti-Japanese behavior, and they are all required to carry certificates (Special Dispatch on the 17th).</p>

<p>Preparing to Fight to the Death With the Japanese</p>
<p>(Beiping) The commander-in-chief of the volunteer army in the 14 counties of Liaodong, due to the urgent attack by the Japanese army from Korea across the Yalu River, has concentrated all of his forces in Tonghua and deployed defenses around Miaogou, preparing to fight to the death with the Japanese army (Special Dispatch on the 17th).</p>

<p>(Beiping) Chen Yintang, a company commander in Xi Qia's army, contacted various companies, imprisoned the regimental commander, and led a mutiny. At that time, he incorporated more than 3,000 volunteer soldiers from various places and formed an alliance with the leaders of the Red Spear Society, Yu Zuosheng and Wu Fanghuo. Their forces have reached more than 3,000 men. They have repeatedly engaged the Japanese army south of Dunhua and have repeatedly destroyed the Jidun Road. They are currently in contact with Wang Delin's forces and are active in the eastern part of Jilin, gaining great momentum (Special Dispatch on the 17th).</p>
<h3 id="e9">Battles Are Occurring North of Lianshan <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>After a fierce battle, the volunteer army on the Shanhaiguan-Shenhai Road and Yu Zhishan's troops have retreated. The Japanese military headquarters in Jinzhou has dispatched a large number of aircraft to cover the infantry and artillery units attacking north of Lianshan. Fierce battles have taken place in Fanjialin and Chenjialin for several days. The volunteer armies on all roads in western Liaoning will coordinate and provide support (Special Dispatch on the 17th).</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the 12th, the volunteer army occupied Yingpan on the Shenhai Line, destroyed bridges, and cut off the Japanese army's road. The Japanese army dispatched 500 guerrillas to provide assistance (Special Dispatch on the 17th).</p>
<h3 id="e10">A Major War Is Imminent, and Ma Zhanshan Is Conducting Anti-Japanese Work <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Claim that Ma's Troops Are Well-Equipped</p>
<p>The Puppet State Humiliates Foreign Reporters</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to Japanese sources, Ma Zhanshan has been preparing for anti-Japanese resistance for a long time. He is now leading a large army south from Baiquan, intending to recover the areas occupied by the Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops. Cheng Zhiyuan, the "chairman of Heilongjiang Province," has ordered the "Manchukuo" troops around Wangkui to "suppress" the attacking troops. This order is somewhat optimistic, and it is doubtful whether it can be achieved. A major war is imminent. Although it is difficult to predict the outcome, it is said that Ma's troops have strict discipline and are well-equipped. If he wins in the future, it would not be surprising. Cheng Zhiyuan probably knows that it is not easy to resist Ma, so he is using it to incite the soldiers and promises to distribute all "booty" publicly. The Japanese claim that Ma has three trucks of banknotes, but it is not known what kind of banknotes they are or the total amount. The eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway is still being attacked from time to time, and it is far from being restored to its original state. Recently, two Chinese were killed and ten were injured in Cheng Gaozi, including two Russians (Reuters Dispatch on the 17th).</p>
<p>(Harbin) Regarding the meeting between the New York Times reporter Steele and the German Algemeiner Zeitung reporter Linz with Ma Zhanshan on the Hu-Hai Line northwest, Li Shu, the police chief of Harbin, issued a written statement yesterday afternoon, stating that Ma Zhanshan had entrusted the above two reporters to deliver important confidential documents to Zhang Xueliang and the Investigation Commission. Regarding the two reporters' military reconnaissance behavior, when the authorities wanted to interrogate them, Steele fled to the American consulate, and Linz entrusted the French consulate after the interrogation. Both said that they met with Ma Zhanshan as reporters and had no other intention, refusing to reveal the content of the meeting despite repeated inquiries. However, the authorities are determined to pursue the investigation to the end (Dentsu Telegram on the 17th).</p>
<p>(Harbin) Linde, a Swiss reporter for the German Daily, and Steele, an American reporter for the New York Times, recently visited General Ma Zhanshan in a village northwest of Hailun. Linde was arrested and interrogated in front of the Consul General on Wednesday evening and was released at 2:00 a.m. the next day. Steele is currently a guest at the American Consul General and has not been arrested. During Linde's interrogation, the police thoroughly searched his room and confiscated all records and films of his travels in Manchuria. Police authorities claim that the two went to meet Ma Zhanshan, the leader of the anti-Manchu army, without notifying the police station in advance, so they can be regarded as spies. However, the two now claim that their visit to Ma was solely for the purpose of exploring news and had no other intentions. According to the opinion of the consular authorities, this matter can be settled peacefully (Reuters Dispatch on the 17th).</p>
<h3 id="e11">The Investigation Commission's Route to Japan Has Not Been Decided <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The Report Is Scheduled to Be Completed on August 15th</p>
<p>(Beiping) At this morning's routine meeting, the Investigation Commission considered taking a detour to Qingdao and taking a ship directly to Nagasaki. Some members are still considering this. The report is scheduled to be completed on August 15th (Special Dispatch on the 17th).</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The International Investigation Commission will soon travel to Japan via Manchuria, Korea, and the sea. The return route will detour through Nanjing. There is talk of departing on the 22nd, but it has not been confirmed. The historical materials since September 18th have been compiled, and drafting has begun. The section on recommendations will be started after arriving in Tokyo. Gu Weijun will return to Beiping no later than the 18th and has decided to accompany the Investigation Commission to Japan (Dentsu Telegram on the 17th).</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun is scheduled to fly to Beijing from Shanghai on the 18th. After a short stay, he will fly to Beiping. In addition to Luo Wengan accompanying him, it is reported that Li Jishen will also travel together to discuss military issues related to the bandit suppression with Zhang Xiang (Telegram on the 17th).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gu Weijun telegraphed Beiping to confirm his arrival in Beiping at noon tomorrow and will host a banquet at his residence tomorrow evening for the Investigation Commission, Luo Wengan, Zhang Xueliang, and other important figures, and instructed to send invitations to all parties (Special Dispatch on the 17th).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Local authorities here now expect Wang Jingwei, Gu Weijun, and Luo Wengan to arrive here tomorrow. It is reported that the three intend to discuss important issues regarding the Northeast with Zhang Xueliang and may submit their opinions and evidence to the League of Nations Investigation Commission (Reuters Dispatch on the 17th).</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The military has decided that there is no basis to prevent Gu Weijun, the Chinese escort accompanying the Investigation Commission, from coming to Japan and has decided to tacitly acknowledge him. However, Gu will not be treated as a diplomat or other official, but as a private individual (Dentsu Telegram on the 17th).</p>

<p>Liang Gongfu's Regiment Engages in a Fierce Battle With Four Warships in Tangjiawan</p>
<p>The Four Warships Retreat and Flee Towards Macau, Planning to Sail Back to Hainan to Rejoin the Forces</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Liang Gongfu's regiment arrived in Tangjiawan early on the 17th and engaged in a fierce battle with Chen Ce's four warships. The battle lasted from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. As a result, the four warships retreated and fled towards Macau. These four warships were all small ships and will sail back to Hainan to rejoin the forces (Telegram on the 17th).</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang's army marched from Zhongshan to Naba Island under cover of darkness and launched a surprise attack on several warships under the command of Chen Ce that were anchored there this morning. The warships were caught off guard and were quite embarrassed. They then regained their composure, but because the artillery positions on the shore occupied a superior position, it was difficult to resist. Finally, they weighed anchor and moved beyond the range of the cannons. As they were sailing, an occasional shell struck back. Macau and Naba Island are separated by a narrow strip of water. This morning, residents were awakened from their sleep by the sound of cannons and machine guns and were all bewildered and panicked. After learning the reason, they flocked to the high ground to watch the battle. It is now believed that the damage is minimal except for Chen Ce's fleet (Reuters Dispatch on the 17th).</p>

They requested the swift dispatch of impartial officials to thoroughly investigate the matter in order to care for people from afar and maintain border stability. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission stated that Gonchok Tenzin is a monk from the Yonghe Temple in Beiping and not a representative of the Dalai Lama.

<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju issued a circular telegram today, stating that after Liu Guitang surrendered, he was organized into the Shandong Garrison Army and ordered to be stationed in Gaotang County. It was hoped that he would be trained and brought into line to serve the country. However, he has a wolf's heart and is fickle and treacherous. He has again colluded with accomplices to rebel, and even dared to drive out the county magistrate and confiscate the militia's weapons. His rebellious actions are obvious and outrageous. Troops have been dispatched to severely suppress him. The bandit is currently fleeing to the border between Shandong and Hebei, and is being pursued. The former designation of the Shandong Garrison Army has been cancelled to avoid further disturbances. A separate telegram has been sent to neighboring provinces to intercept him. This circular telegram is specially issued for your information. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Gunfire at Taikoo Dockyard and the Japanese Consulate</p>
<p>Grief and Indignation Lead to Madness, Murder, and Suicide</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Today, a crazed Chinese man killed one person and injured three. He then sat on the Japanese Consul's office chair, calmly raised a gun, and shot himself to death. The incident occurred around 3 p.m. The Chinese man broke into Taikoo Dockyard and, after a brief argument, drew a gun and shot Hu Haidong (transliterated), the son of the shipping manager of Taikoo Dockyard, directly. He then turned and seriously wounded Hu Haidong, who has been sent to the hospital. Reuters, which is located next to Taikoo Dockyard, heard the gunfire. Its manager rushed out to see Hu Bolu (transliterated) lying in a pool of blood, shot in the shoulder and head, and dying. He died shortly after. Two Indian guards from Taikoo Dockyard carried guns to protect him, but the incident happened so suddenly that they could not prevent it. By the time the police arrived, the assailant had fled. The crazed man then went to the Japanese Consulate and requested to see the Japanese Consul. The people at the consulate told him that the Consul was out. They were unaware of the incident at Taikoo Dockyard, so they allowed him to enter the office. Two Japanese officials were working in the room. The crazed man immediately drew a gun and shot them. One was shot in the shoulder and one in the abdomen. The crazed man then sat calmly on the Consul's chair. His gun was empty, so he reloaded it and shot himself in the head, the bullet piercing his brain and killing him. The Japanese official shot in the abdomen is seriously injured. The incident caused a great shock throughout the island. Hu Haidong is a well-known Chinese businessman who has worked for Taikoo Dockyard for many years. It is reported that his injuries are not serious. Further dispatch: It is now confirmed that the assailant today was a well-known overseas Chinese in Hong Kong. It is now believed that his actions were motivated by anti-Japanese grief and indignation, because the Wu family and his son are currently using Japanese coal to operate the ships they chartered. Of the two injured at the Japanese Consulate, one is the chief clerk, who was seriously injured in the abdomen, and the other is the secretary, who suffered only minor injuries. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) At 3:00 PM today, a Chinese man in Western attire visited the Japanese Consulate General. Consul Arida was out, and official Nanyama Katsuta郎 took over.

The victims were immediately sent to the hospital for treatment, but their injuries are serious. It is said that the perpetrator's name is Chen Fu. Before the attack, he shot and wounded Wu, a comprador at Taikoo Dockyard, and killed his son. Then he attacked the Japanese Consulate, it is said. (17th Japanese Union Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to information from American businesses, regarding the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's hope to borrow 10 million from the Da Lai Company, someone unofficially discussed the matter with the American side. The American side considers this a major undertaking and requires a reliable guarantee and a definite method for repaying the principal and interest before submitting a report to the board of directors in New York for approval. Recently, the Chinese side has not continued discussions, and it is unlikely that further talks will be successful. This is because a telegram from New York stated that the Chinese side's creditworthiness for borrowing needs further study. For example, the two tobacco and alcohol loans handled by Abbott through the Chicago Continental Commercial Bank and the Pacific Development Company have had no impact on the principal or interest to date, rendering the two bonds worthless in the market. In the future, investment in China must have the right to effectively supervise income and expenditure before negotiations can proceed. If that is the case, it will be difficult for the Chinese side to accept. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Anti-Banditry Should Focus on Military Training <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Zhizhong told people that red bandits in various provinces have been suppressed for several years, but not only have they not been eliminated, but their numbers have increased. The reason is mainly the lack of training of the anti-banditry troops. Poorly trained troops become flustered when they come into contact with bandits, abandoning their weapons, assisting the bandits, and fleeing from the battlefield. As a result, the bandits can easily obtain large quantities of weapons, increasing their strength and spreading their influence. In my opinion, anti-banditry troops should be lean and effective, not large in number. Unskilled and undisciplined miscellaneous troops only send weapons to the bandits, which is worse than not suppressing them at all. Therefore, well-trained troops are the basic plan for suppressing the communists. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e74">Lausanne Conference Enters an Active Phase <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>First Plenary Session Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Chairman Reads Declaration in the Name of the Five Great Powers</p>
<p>Declares Temporary Suspension of Payment of Due Debts</p>
<p>▲Havas Agency, Lausanne, 17th: The Lausanne Conference, which is attracting worldwide attention, entered an active phase this morning. The first plenary session was held at 10:15 this morning. The general public has high hopes for the outcome of the Lausanne Conference. At the beginning of this morning's meeting, British Prime Minister MacDonald, as Chairman of the Conference, made an extremely important declaration in the name of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Italy, and Japan. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>[The undersigned governments, recognizing that the economic and financial crisis is endangering the whole world, and that the situation is urgent, believe that the various issues currently raised must be given a final and precise solution in order to improve the situation in Europe. They also believe that such a solution should be sought immediately and without interruption, in order to achieve its realization within the scope of the worldwide settlement. Furthermore, in view of the fact that certain reparations and war debts will be due in July of this year, they believe that the Conference should reach a conclusion in the shortest possible time. The payment of all debts owed by the participating countries due to reparations and war debts should be temporarily suspended during the Conference. However, ordinary debts issued on the market will not be affected by this decision. The undersigned governments declare that they are prepared to proceed in accordance with this agreement and request that other creditor governments adopt the same attitude. Signed in Lausanne on June 16, 1932. Representatives of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Chamberlain; Representative of France, Herriot; Representative of Belgium, Runkin; Representative of Italy, Grandi; Representative of Japan, Yoshida.]</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Lausanne, 17th: When MacDonald finished reading, there was thunderous applause. German Chancellor von Papen immediately rose and made a brief speech, welcoming this declaration and calling it the first proof that the five signatory countries were determined to facilitate the work of the conference in order to obtain a great and practical solution. He earnestly hoped that other countries concerned would also understand the meaning of this declaration, etc. According to the five-nation declaration and the German statement, although neither explicitly mentioned the United States, they both implicitly referred to the US government. After von Papen finished speaking, he asked the journalists to leave the room and held a secret meeting to discuss the plan for a temporary suspension of all reparations payments.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Von Papen States Germany's Position <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Wording is Tactful and Appropriate</p>
<p>According to today's conference, the discussion was started by the German Chancellor. Von Papen spoke fluently in French, vividly describing Germany's economic and financial situation. He stated that Germany certainly did not want to formally abandon the financial obligations it had accepted in the past, but now one thing is different. These obligations no longer correspond to the various facts, and dealing with this reality is extremely important not only for Germany but also for the world. At the Hague Conference, the world was still full of optimism, but since then, optimism has gradually turned into pessimism and even disappointment. Today, when we look around the world, we only see a sharp increase in unemployment, and various countries have been forced to admit their inability to cope with foreign debts. Capital and deposits have gradually tightened, coupled with soaring gold prices and plummeting commodity prices. These phenomena all provide us with clear evidence that war debts and reparations need to be reorganized urgently. He then commented on the chain of political debts, gold distribution, and commodity exchange, as well as the relationship between gold reserves and foreign trade surplus and deficit. He solemnly stated that the main cause of the current world crisis must be found in the political payment system that does not conform to economic principles. He then switched to describing Germany's internal affairs, saying that the advisory committee of the Bank for International Settlements declared last December that Germany's taxes had reached the maximum limit. However, the new and old German governments, although aware of this declaration, still had to risk national bankruptcy in order to maintain the operation of the national machinery and prevent it from collapsing, and imposed new taxes on the people who had suffered for a long time. Now the situation is even more difficult. The long-term development of the revolutionary ideas of the unemployed people, and the daily reduction of the foreign currency reserves of the Deutsche Bank, these ominous signs must be curbed by any sacrifice. The Hoover moratorium gave the Germans a little respite, but it was still insufficient. Later, although international experts made suggestions, they were not given due consideration, which is regrettable. He then refuted the rumors that Germany would become a terrible competitor in the world market after the cancellation of reparations. Germany had to pay heavy interest on private foreign debts, which would still weaken its commercial competitiveness even after the abolition of political debts. Finally, he stated that Germany has clearly proved after repeated trials that the payment of reparations cannot continue. Now it is not only a clear hint, but also has proved to be harmful to the rest of the world. I think even if another trial is made, it will have no practical value, because it will inevitably fail. The time for solving the problem by using temporary extensions and a little respite has passed. The work of this conference is to clear up the various things in the past and open up a path for active cooperation in the future. Only by doing this can we lead us to a bright future, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Great Britain Prepares for Great Sacrifices <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Lausanne, 17th: After von Papen's speech at today's meeting, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain rose and addressed the meeting, stating that he represented the entire people of Great Britain and declared that although Britain bore a heavy burden, it was prepared to take part in the total write-off, provided that all the governments concerned participated in this action. This move will force Great Britain to sacrifice about 200 billion pounds sterling. (According to the US method of calculation, one billion is 1,000,000,000. According to the British and German method of calculation, one billion is 1,000,000,000,000. Therefore, 200 billion should have 200,000,000,000,000. It is unknown which is correct.) This is the difference between the war debts that the United Kingdom should pay and the reparations it receives. However, the British people now feel that only by taking this thorough plan can they restore credit, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Britain and France Agree on Suspension Plan <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Paris, 17th: Today's Le Matin in Paris carried a very reliable news story that French Prime Minister Herriot and British Prime Minister MacDonald have tentatively agreed on the reparations issue, which can not only extend the Hoover moratorium period, but also indefinitely suspend all conditional and unconditional reparations. The final solution will have to wait until some agreement can be reached with the United States on the issue of canceling all war debts. It is said that this tentative agreement will be drafted into a resolution and submitted to the conference. When British Prime Minister MacDonald met with German Chancellor von Papen yesterday, he strongly urged von Papen to reluctantly agree to this proposal and abandon Germany's claim that the reparations issue must be resolved immediately. Today's Le Journal Echo in Paris carried a commentary by the famous nationalist journalist Pantina Cuss, who opposed this plan, strongly arguing that eliminating the boundary between conditional and unconditional reparations hinders French interests. He believed that the Lausanne Conference might as well adjourn and convene from time to time until it ends in November, so as to negotiate with the United States on one hand to obtain full progress, so as to revise the Young Plan.</p>
<h3 id="e78">British Prime Minister Eager for European and American Cooperation <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Lausanne, 17th: British Prime Minister MacDonald's remarks at yesterday's meeting gave the impression that the cancellation of war debts is still far away. The British Prime Minister's remarks involving the United States were particularly moving. He said, "There is now a great opportunity before us that can enable us to join hands to stop the impact of the economic decline that is now causing the world. Europe cannot act alone. The United States has given us a kind of confidence that after the present situation has passed, the United States can cooperate with us, at least to study some greater difficult problems, and jointly formulate policies to revive trade and enrich the country. These guarantees are what we all must rejoice in."</p>
<h3 id="e79">Three Solutions for War Debts <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The current conference faces three distinct main solutions: (1) Can the conference agree to a unanimous cancellation of reparations and war debts? (2) Can the conference agree to reduce reparations and war debts based on a percentage? (3) Can the conference agree to extend the moratorium on international government debts, which expires on June 30th, and postpone the overall solution to another day? According to general speculation, the most likely to be realized is the third solution mentioned above. However, regardless of the developments, Britain is ultimately in an unenviable position. Under any decision, Britain will inevitably suffer some loss, which is beyond doubt. The United States is currently attending the conference only as an observer, but it is noteworthy that there is a growing public sentiment in the United States advocating for complete cancellation, rather than prolonging the pain with a policy of slightly reducing reparations and war debts. After Prime Minister MacDonald's speech, the conference briefly handled routine matters and then adjourned, scheduled to reconvene today.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Franco-German Prime Ministers' Harmonious Negotiations <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Lausanne, 16th: This afternoon, the chief representatives of the six major powers—Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, and Japan—held a secret meeting at the Hôtel du Château, which lasted only twenty minutes. It was decided that general discussions would begin tomorrow morning, with German Chancellor Papen speaking first, followed by French Prime Minister Herriot, British representative Chamberlain, and Italian Foreign Minister Grandi in succession. After the secret meeting, Papen immediately visited Herriot for an hour-long conversation. It is said that the two exchanged views on the internal situation in Germany and various issues in the conference. The conversation was extremely friendly and harmonious. Subsequently, Papen visited British Prime Minister MacDonald, followed by another private meeting with Herriot for more than an hour. Papen is fluent in English and French, and the conversations between the three could be frank and unreserved, without the need for an interpreter, which is a great convenience. It was rumored that during Papen's second meeting with Herriot, their opinions differed, and Herriot's tone was slightly heated. However, the authorities have firmly denied this, stating that the tone of the two Prime Ministers' meetings was friendly throughout. The French Prime Minister expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the meeting, saying that it demonstrated the goodwill of both sides.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Hoover and Curtis <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Still Nominated as Presidential and Vice-Presidential Candidates for the Next Term</p>
<p>The U.S. Republican Convention Concluded in Jubilant Celebration</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Chicago, 16th: The National Republican Convention today nominated Hoover as the U.S. presidential candidate for the next term and Curtis as the vice-presidential candidate, and then adjourned. Before the adjournment, the convention hall was filled with jubilation and uproar. The California delegation led the crowd in a serpentine dance around the hall, while five thousand colorful balloons floated in the air of the building, accompanied by whistling, banging on tin cans, singing, piano music, and dancing. A secretary and Treasury Secretary Mills playfully batted balloons back and forth on the stage as if playing tennis. Another delegate held a woman high above his shoulders and walked around the room.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 16th: Proponents of repealing Prohibition here have expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. Republican Convention's adoption of a party platform that supports central management of the liquor industry as a replacement for Prohibition, calling it a fence-sitting move that is quite detestable.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Scope of the Economic Conference <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Study of Trade Cooperation Methods Among Autonomous Regions</p>
<p>Monetary System Issue to Lay a Foundation for the Future</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 16th: Overseas Autonomous Region Minister Thomas today briefly indicated in the House of Commons the events to be discussed at the Ottawa British Empire Economic Conference, saying that the first issue to be discussed is trade, namely what steps should be taken between Autonomous Region A and Autonomous Region B to benefit their mutual trade. This matter will naturally and clearly raise the issue of tariff rates and imperial preferential treatment. Britain's allowing autonomous region goods to be imported freely into the British market has greatly contributed to the goodwill of all parties towards this issue. The second issue to be discussed is the rationalization of British Empire industries and currency and financial issues. The entire monetary system issue is of course included. No conference can hope to resolve such important and complex events in a matter of weeks, but the British government has already begun to handle many preliminary tasks, which can be regarded as important. Thomas also stated that the British government will advocate for the establishment of an organization that can represent the various autonomous regions in daily contact, without having to wait until the Imperial Conference is held every three years. In addition, there is one more matter to consider, which is the issue of immigration. Immigration must depend on the restoration of prosperity in the autonomous regions.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Ottawa, 16th: Canada currently plans to proceed with new foreign trade agreements after the British Empire Economic Conference is held in July. The 1922 trade agreement between Canada and France has recently been repealed, and a temporary measure was planned to replace it, but negotiations failed, so both countries will apply full tariff rates. Canada's trade agreements with Japan and fifteen other European and South American countries have also been repealed and will be subject to new trade agreements after the Ottawa Conference.</p>

<p>▲Japanese United News, Tokyo, 17th: Lieutenant General Nomura, Commander of the Third Fleet, is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on the 24th to take up the post of Military Councilor, temporarily retiring for recuperation. Lieutenant General Sakonji will succeed him as Commander of the Third Fleet and will depart from Sasebo on the Izumo warship on the 30th, arriving in Shanghai on July 2nd.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, New York, 16th: Japanese gold worth 5 million yen arrived here today, increasing the amount of cash stored in the United States, which has not happened in months. The recent surge in the U.S. dollar and the arrival of this Japanese gold in the U.S. lead many to believe that the outflow of U.S. cash will cease from now on. This is because after the Bank of France transferred 50 million yen in cash a few days ago, the bank's deposits in the United States have been completely withdrawn. Today, 8 million yen in cash was shipped to France and Switzerland, which is the amount that has already been withdrawn. It is estimated that there is still 43 million yen in cash that has been withdrawn and is awaiting export.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Peruvian Capital, 16th: According to a telegram from Santiago, a counter-revolution has broken out in Chile. It is reported that the counter-revolutionary party is led by General San Ciers and has occupied the Presidential Palace in the capital. The recent revolution in Chile was caused by former President Montt-iros dismissing Air Force Commander Grove. The military incited Grove to launch a revolution, overthrowing the original government and establishing a socialist-style political system. The revolutionary party organized a government committee of three, but internal divisions soon emerged. Revolutionary leader Tavella, originally a member of the government committee, resigned and retired after being criticized for being too soft on foreign businesses.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Chilean Capital, 17th: Counter-revolutionaries have nominated Tavella as the head of the new civilian government. The new government has declared that it intends to implement a moderate socialist policy and respect the interests of foreigners.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Chilean Capital, 17th: General San Ciers has declared himself the head of the new Chilean government. This is a non-military government, but it is said to have the full support of the garrison. Air Force Commander Grove, the leader of the socialist government that lasted only ten days, has been dismissed because Grove failed to separate the army from politics.</p>

<p>Uchida Will Take Up the Post of Foreign Minister Early</p>
<p>Finance Minister Takahashi's Resignation Intention Is Very Firm</p>
<p>▲Den-tsu, Tokyo, 17th: The Ministry of Colonial Affairs convened Vice-Minister Kawata, Bureau Chief Ikomi, Colonial Affairs Bureau Chief Gunyama, and Colonial Industry Bureau Chief Kitajima this morning at 10:00 to discuss the so-called four-headed political unification issue in Manchuria. The following decisions were made: (1) Establish a new agency to oversee all institutions in Manchuria. (2) The qualifications for the head of the new agency will not be restricted, but when a military officer is appointed, he will be concurrently the Commander of the Kwantung Army. (3) The head of the agency will be under the supervision of the Minister of Colonial Affairs, but matters involving foreign affairs will be under the supervision of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. (4) Under the head of the agency, there will be one assistant officer who is a civil servant appointed by the Emperor. (5) Abolish the Kwantung Government-General. (6) The administrative power of the Manchurian Railway Zone belongs to the newly established agency. (7) Consulates currently stationed in various parts of Manchuria and Mongolia will serve as staff members of the new agency and will be under the command of the head of the new agency.</p>
<p>▲Den-tsu, Tokyo, 17th: President Uchida will depart for Dalian on the 19th to sort out the remaining affairs in order to take up the post of Foreign Minister as soon as possible. After completing the arrangements, he will return to Tokyo to assume the post of Foreign Minister because the League of Nations investigation team will visit Japan on the 27th of this month, and Prime Minister Saito hopes that Count Uchida will take office early so that he can receive the investigation team at that time.</p>
<p>▲Hua Lian News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: Finance Minister Takahashi expressed his intention to resign to Prime Minister Saito after today's cabinet meeting, saying that important financial and economic bills have been passed by the Diet, and his health is weak, making him unable to bear this heavy responsibility. Prime Minister Saito tried his best to persuade him to stay, but Takahashi's intention to resign is very firm, and it is feared that he will not be able to remain in office. If Takahashi insists on resigning, the issue of his successor will be very noteworthy.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Araki <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Responds to Questions in the House of Representatives</p>
<p>▲Is Manchuria Not Territory of the Republic of China?</p>
<p>▲Did the League of Nations Investigation Team Report This?</p>
<p>Osaka Mainichi News reports that during a closed-door meeting of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Speaker Shimada Ryuji raised questions regarding troop expenditures in Manchuria, relations with Russia, and other issues. Araki said that troop strength in Manchuria still needs to be supplemented in the future and that military assistance will be followed by political and economic assistance. Regarding relations with Russia, the situation in northern Manchuria was tense for a time, but Russia has now changed its policy towards Manchuria, so there should be no problem, but attention should still be paid to changes in the background atmosphere. As for the future of Manchuria, there is nothing to worry about except for its relationship with the League of Nations, and the League of Nations' attitude will depend on the atmosphere at the time of the convocation of the General Assembly in September. However, Japan is very concerned about this point. Subsequently, Matsumoto Tadao also raised questions, asking whether the Shanghai Truce Agreement concluded on May 5 was the responsibility of the Minister of the Army. According to foreign news reports, the withdrawal of Japanese troops was due to the weakness of the Japanese army and economic difficulties, which is quite regrettable for the prestige of our army. It is also rumored that France has negotiated with Japan to invest in Manchuria. Is Manchuria included in the Republic of China? Please clarify the truth on all these matters. Araki replied that the Shanghai Truce Agreement belongs to a military agreement, and the information in foreign news reports is not credible. Director of the Asian Affairs Bureau Toya replaced Araki to continue the defense, saying that although Manchuria is formally included in the Republic of China, the reality is completely opposite. The interim report of the League of Nations investigation committee also states that Manchuria is not under the influence of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>Nagoya News, Tokyo, reports that on the 9th, the ambassadors of the four countries, Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, jointly visited Prime Minister Saito to respond to the previous Foreign Minister Yoshizawa's proposal to hold a round table conference in Shanghai to solicit the opinions of the Japanese government. The British and American governments absolutely believe that it is impossible to hold a preparatory meeting in Tokyo without China first. France and Italy also said that the time is too early. Since the four countries have expressed their opposition, it seems difficult to achieve the goal, and the meeting may be abandoned.</p>

<p>▲Military and Political Authorities of Five Provinces Summoned to Attend</p>
<p>▲Diplomacy, Finance, and Military Affairs Discussed with Solutions</p>
<p>▲Chiang Agrees to Increase Military Expenditures for Various Armies in Hubei Province</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Chiang Kai-shek ascended Lushan, military and political figures from the five provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Henan, such as He Yingqin, Xiong Shihui of Jiangxi, He Jian of Hunan, Liu Zhenhua of Henan, He Chengjun, Xu Yuanquan, Xia Douyin, Qian Dajun, Xiao Zhichu, Yu Feipeng, Ye Peng, and Shangguan Yunxiang of Hubei, have been summoned to Lushan to attend the bandit suppression conference. The civil affairs chiefs of the five provinces were also subsequently summoned to participate. The bandit suppression conference was originally said to be held on the 13th, but it was postponed by one day because the generals had not yet arrived. The scope of the conference was originally the allocation of troops, strategies for suppression, procurement of supplies, local rehabilitation, and issues such as how to unify command and how to divide responsibilities. When Wang Jingwei, Li Jishen, Huang Shaoxiong, Gu Weijun, and Li Shizeng jointly ascended the mountain on the 14th, the scope of the conference was expanded to include discussions on diplomacy and finance. On the evening of the 14th, the key figures first consulted on diplomacy and decided on concrete policies. On the 15th, they discussed finance and military affairs, and by the morning of the 16th, the discussions were completed. Wang, Li, and others then returned to Nanjing, and Xu Yuanquan and Xiao Zhichu also returned to Hankou on the Jiangshun ship. He Chengjun, however, needed to further consult on bandit suppression matters and could descend the mountain on the 17th. It is said that Chiang Kai-shek was slightly indisposed due to days of hard work and instructed He to postpone his return to Hankou in order to plan the military and supplies for bandit suppression in detail. Currently, Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government has departed from Nanjing westward, and Liu Zhenhua, the Pacification Commissioner of the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border area, has passed through Hankou eastward and will be able to ascend the mountain on the 17th. Presumably, after the meeting, He will be able to depart. As for the results of the conference, apart from Wang, Li, and others making simple statements upon their return to Nanjing, it is said that there were indeed new decisions on the diplomatic front, new avenues for revenue on the financial front, and more complete plans for military suppression. Issues such as unifying the military system and facilitating transportation were discussed, and there were also discussions about expanding the 10th Army into two armies and merging certain brigades into certain divisions. All of this is just piecemeal information and does not fully represent the content of the conference. In addition, regarding the issue of supplies for the various armies, nothing has been heard from other provinces, but the armies in Hubei Province have been suffering due to the lack of funds. This time, He Chengjun earnestly requested Chiang to increase the military expenditure by several tenths in order to encourage the soldiers to work hard in bandit suppression, and Chiang has verbally agreed, but the amount has not yet been determined. As for the date of Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in Hankou, it is difficult to confirm at present. The General Headquarters is said to be located in Hankou, while others say it will be located in Bengbu. It is more likely to be located in Bengbu, and Hankou will only have a command post, which will be abolished after Chiang leaves Hankou. (June 16th)</p>

<p>▲Shops in the Town of Guangji Looted Clean</p>
<p>▲Remnant Bandits Show Signs of Retreating to Qichun</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The 25th Army of the Fourth Front Army of the Red Army, known as two divisions, led by the bandit leader Xu Xiangqian, recently detoured from Yingshan and Huoshan in Anhui Province, through Ximabian in Qishui, and attacked Guangji. Because the local defense was weak, it was captured. The bandits took advantage of the situation to seize Wuxue, intending to cut off traffic on the Yangtze River and then disrupt Wuhan. At that time, only one regiment of Zhang Wanxin's division was stationed in Wuxue, and the strength was not large, and the situation was quite serious. Fortunately, the 47th Division was ordered to open Hankou, and one brigade arrived. The Pacification Commissioner's Office sent it to suppress the bandits and the navy also dispatched the Yongsheng and Datong warships to Zhenxie Wuxue. At the same time, the 4th Aviation Team stationed in Hankou also sent planes to assist in the bombing. When the bandits passed through Qishui, they were surrounded by Ge Yunlong's division and suffered heavy losses. After further pressure, they were unable to withstand it and had to change their plans. On the evening of the 13th, they automatically withdrew from the city of Guangji and fled to Shiyinzhaibei north of the county, attempting to disturb Qichun. On the 15th, the Pacification Commissioner's Office received a telegram from Shangguan Yunxiang, saying, "According to reports, the bandits occupying Guangji number about several thousand, half of whom have guns. It is heard that our army arrived in Wuxue, and on the 13th night, they fled to the vicinity of Shiyinzhaibei north of Guangji. I hereby report." The report received from the 34th Division stationed at Wuxue, from the commander of the regiment, Dong Tingbo, stated, "The bandit leader in Guangji is Xu Xiangqian. Yesterday, the 14th, repeated reports from people in the county town stated that the bandit troops completely retreated to the Baitu Ridge Zhangjiacai area last night, and the merchants and people in the city were looted clean. I have now asked County Magistrate Dong to quickly gather the team to go to the county town to maintain order." In addition, the Civil Affairs Office received a telegram from Gui Fucang, County Magistrate of Huangmei, stating, "According to reports, the Red Army bandits in Guangji were very panic-stricken yesterday due to the bombing by aircraft. At the same time, they were oppressed by the Nationalist army from Wuxue, and they showed signs of retreating to Qichun. I request that the Nationalist army in Wuxue be ordered to track down and suppress them in order to eliminate them." On the 16th, another telegram was received, stating that County Magistrate Dong had returned to the city, and order had been restored. However, after the catastrophe, the desolate situation was unbearable to witness. As for one part of Du Brigade of the 47th Division, it has been led by the Deputy Division Commander to advance towards Guangji. Li Brigade and the direct units of the division also arrived completely in Wuxue on the 16th, and the water and land defenses were extremely solid. (June 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Shandong Government-Established Yulu Pawnshop Opens <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>▲Purpose Is to Provide Relief to the Poor</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the May 3rd Incident in Jinan, all pawnshops have been closed. Japanese people saw an opportunity to take advantage of this and opened pawnshops one after another, exploiting with high interest rates. The term was as short as two months, and the interest rate was as high as 10%. Even if something was pawned for only one day, it was calculated as one month. For example, if something was pawned on the 31st of one month and redeemed on the 1st of the next month, it was only two days, but two months' interest had to be paid. In actual calculation, the interest rate was no less than 20%. Moreover, when there were good clothes, they were arbitrarily replaced, and gold and silver were randomly cut and reduced. Our people knew that they were losing too much, but they were forced to do so due to economic difficulties. According to statistics, in the four years since then, Japanese pawnshops have seized no less than 10 million yuan from our country. Each pawnshop earns an average of hundreds of thousands to over a million yuan per year. Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government, organized a government pawnshop to relieve the people's livelihood. Initially, it was planned to be jointly run by the government and merchants, but due to various difficulties, it took years to prepare and could not be realized. Recently, the Provincial Government allocated 300,000 yuan to establish the Yulu Government Pawnshop, with Zhao Xinru as the Director of Preparation. The old site of the pawnshop on Anchasijie was selected as the address. The Provincial Government also approved the allocation of 300,000 yuan from the rice and wheat special donation to be deposited in the Minsheng Bank for the official pawnshop to use. The official pawnshop's method stipulates an interest rate of 2%, with no interest charged for less than ten days. The term is one month, with an additional month for those who are late, to show relief to the poor. At 9:00 a.m. on the 15th, the Yulu Government Pawnshop held its opening ceremony. Those who participated included Chairman Han Fuju, heads of various departments, representatives of various agencies, representatives of various groups, and more than 200 other people. Zhao Xinru, Director of Preparation, reported on the preparation process, followed by a speech by Han Fuju. Finally, Zhang Honglie, Director of the Department of Construction, gentlemen Ma Liang, Zhang Weicun of the Provincial Rectification Committee, and others spoke in succession. At 10:00 a.m., a photo was taken and the meeting was adjourned. The pawnshop will start business on the 16th. (June 15th)</p>

<p>Since the Republic of China 17th year, Gansu Province has been afflicted with successive disturbances, followed by repeated famines, with starving people everywhere and fields completely deserted. In Lintao and other western areas, as well as Linxia, ​​Hezheng, Ningding, Yongjing and other counties, it has been five years since any crops have been planted. After Shao Lizi took office, he urgently sought to stabilize the situation and dispatched Lin Jing, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, as the Special Commissioner for Pacification in the west of Taohe to inspect various places in person. However, the provincial treasury was empty, and it was difficult to raise funds. The matter was previously submitted to the central government for relief, and the Executive Yuan has resolved to allocate 40,000 yuan from the national treasury. However, this is just a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. It is heard that Shao has also sent letters to Dai Chuanxian, Ju Zheng, Ma Fuxiang, Zhang Ji, and other key figures for assistance in raising funds. It is thought that Dai and others recently considered the development of the northwest as the top priority and are all determined to rescue those in distress and will definitely do their best to find ways.</p>

<p>New Regulations Restricting the Import of Chinese Labor</p>
<p>▲Only 1,000 Allowed to Enter Each Month</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: On average, over 120,000 people from Guangdong and Fujian go to Singapore and the Nanyang Islands each year to make a living. In recent years, due to the decline in the prices of local products in Nanyang and the sluggish sales of rubber and tin, all industries have been in extreme decline. The number of people who have been repatriated due to unemployment is very large. The British government in Singapore promulgated the Regulations on Restricting Overseas Chinese in September 1930, allowing only 5,000 people to enter each month, limited to three months. Later, the period was extended repeatedly, and the number was reduced to 2,500 per month. From June 1st of this year, new regulations were issued restricting the entry of adult male laborers (over 14 years old), allowing only 1,000 people to enter Singapore each month from the four ports of Hong Kong, Shantou, Xiamen, and Haikou. The shipping companies are allocated quotas according to their original passenger capacity. Currently, all the inns and shipping companies in Shantou are suffering significant losses. As for the unemployed overseas Chinese in Nanyang, about several thousand are transported back to Shantou each month. There are several overseas Chinese reception centers in Shantou's commercial street: (1) the Vietnamese Returning Overseas Chinese Reception Center, (2) the Unemployed Returning Overseas Chinese Relief Center. Those returning from the Annam area are managed by the Cunxin Shantang, and those returning from the British and Dutch territories are managed by the Municipal Government. Both are currently processing the sending of people back to their hometowns.</p>

<p>▲Provincial Government Strictly Orders Reporting and Delivery of House Rent: The Provincial Government, because the treasury was exhausted, spent a lot of money during the war, and after discussion, it decided to issue a general order to all counties to collect two months' house rent according to the precedent of the 17th year. After this county received the order to levy one month's house rent, the people said that the economy was difficult and sent telegrams to the provincial government requesting exemption. The provincial government issued an order refusing to allow the exemption and ordered the continuation of the levy and reporting. Now, the county government has received a strict order from Shu Shifu, Director of the Department of Finance, holding the County Magistrate and the Director of the Public Security Bureau fully responsible, stating that the collection of house rent has long been overdue and not a single penny has been delivered. Such negligence in the execution of the law and delay in important public affairs is truly hateful and should be punished, but leniency is granted for now. It is hereby urged again that the County Magistrate shall comply, quickly collect the two months' house rent that has been levied together with the Director of the Public Security Bureau, and report and deliver it in full within five days to meet urgent needs. If there are funds that have already been collected and stored, they should be delivered to the Jiangsu Bank Treasury immediately after receiving the telegram, with the receipt presented for verification and collection, and no arbitrary retention or misappropriation is allowed. Violators will be ordered to pay compensation and must understand that the County Magistrate bears full responsibility for handling the house rent and must effectively supervise the Director of the Public Security Bureau to earnestly collect it and complete it as soon as possible. If the order is violated again, the County Magistrate will be presented for severe punishment, and the Director of the Public Security Bureau who fails to handle the matter effectively will also be subject to disciplinary action. Reply by telegram immediately.</p>

<p>▲Director of the Construction Bureau Detained for Embezzlement: Wu Junyu, Director of the Kunshan County Construction Bureau, has been in office in Kunshan for five years, engaging in gambling every day, with no construction at all and hundreds of acts of corruption. In May, he was accused of embezzlement in the recruitment of laborers. After the county supervisory committee found solid evidence, it was transferred to the county for handling. However, on the evening of the 15th, County Magistrate Cheng Ruji secretly ordered the police team Liu</p>

<p>▲ Deserters Rob Near the City: After the troops stationed in Changshu were withdrawn, more than a dozen deserters gathered together and arbitrarily looted in various villages. On the morning of the 16th, around 2:00 AM, eleven deserters wearing uniforms without insignias arrived at the Xiao Maojia Shen Tong Fang area, about five li outside the North Water Gate of the city. They first fired their rifles to intimidate the residents. The partners inside scattered upon hearing the sounds. The deserters then arbitrarily looted everything within the Fang, taking all the foreign goods and women's jewelry. Afterward, they went to Gujiawan Lusanjiu's house near the Xingfu Temple at the North Dry Gate to loot. They dispersed at dawn. After receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau dispatched a security team, but they did not return to the city by evening.</p>
<p>▲ Provincial Committee Investigates Enemy Grain Supply Case: This county has fertile land and was originally a rice-producing area. Neighboring areas such as Shanghai, Chongming, and Haimen must come to Changshu every year to purchase food, amounting to tens of thousands of shi. The county government only needs to have a formal transport permit from these counties to allow the rice to pass. This year, since the January 28th Incident, the enemy, due to a shortage of food, colluded with merchants to purchase rice at high prices in the interior. At that time, this county was ordered by the military to prepare for long-term resistance, requiring the county to reserve enough domestic rice to supply 100,000 soldiers for a year. Therefore, even with permits from neighboring counties, exports were not allowed. However, treacherous merchants, tempted by huge profits, secretly came from Haimen and Chongming counties to purchase rice. Several ships carrying thousands of shi of rice were intercepted successively at ports and the Luyuan area. Subsequently, someone reported to the authorities, suspecting certain merchants of supplying grain to the enemy. At the same time, the Chongming county government was also bombarded with telegrams from the county's citizens to the provincial authorities, accusing the county government of issuing permits and aiding the enemy. They requested an investigation. At the time, the provincial authorities were unable to investigate immediately due to the military situation. Now, to clarify the truth, the Civil Affairs Department dispatched Wu Zezhong, a committee member, to investigate and verify the matter. After receiving the order, Committee Member Wu arrived in Changshu on the 15th of this month to secretly investigate the rice purchases made by the county. He went to the county government to review all the case files. It is said that Committee Member Wu will stay in Changshu for one or two days and then cross the river to Chongming County for a secret investigation.</p>

<p>▲ Xinji Steamboat Robbed Yesterday Morning: Robbery cases in this county are more frequent than in other counties. The Shanghai and Wuxi newspapers cannot record them all. The public security authorities rarely solve them, so the trend of theft is rampant. Several alarms occur in one night, causing great unease for the police. Yesterday, news came of three robbery cases, both on land and water. They are recorded as follows: 1. The Jiangyin Gushan route of the Xinji Steamboat Bureau at Gongyun Bridge. Yesterday (the 17th) morning, around 7:00 AM, it departed from Gushan fully loaded with passengers, heading to Wuxi. When passing the Xili Bridge area, about ten li from Zhangjing Bridge in the seventh district of this county, the steamboat stopped as usual to allow passengers to disembark or board. Unexpectedly, three bandits, carrying two Mauser pistols and a bayonet, disguised themselves as passengers on the steamboat. The purser, Deng, did not suspect anything. When the steamboat reached Huangshan Bridge, the three bandits drew their Mauser pistols, intimidated the passengers, and searched them one by one, losing more than 700 yuan. After the robbery, the bandits cut the tow rope of the tugboat and forced the helmsman to release the steamboat, quickly sailing to Wan'an Bridge, where they abandoned the boat and disembarked, heading towards Dongheng. Afterward, the purser, Deng, called the Xinji Steamboat Bureau to report to the Public Security Bureau and the county government, requesting the dispatch of police to pursue the bandits. After receiving the report, County Chief Chen and Bureau Chief Hua immediately dispatched detectives to the countryside by boat for a thorough pursuit. The police detachment stationed at Zhangjing Bridge and the Huangtutang merchants' association also rushed to hunt them down but were unsuccessful. 2. Cai Shigen and Long A'jun's houses in Shangmadun outside the East Gate were robbed by two thieves on the night of the 16th, one after another, losing more than 100 yuan. 3. Chen Yonggen's house in Yangxiang, near Yanqiao in the fifth district, was also robbed by five or six bandits who broke into the house. Only a silver bracelet was stolen. Chen Yonggen was stabbed in the right arm by the bandits. The case has been reported to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>▲ Power Lines Broken, Two Victims: Yesterday morning (the 17th) around 4:00 AM, two power lines, numbers 2253 and 2254, in Xiatang Town outside the South Gate suddenly broke. A vendor from Yancheng, Liu Zhongjing, and Xu A'fu asked the former's eldest daughter, Dabao, to help. After Dabao learned of it, she called a neighbor, Wu Tabao, to go together. Both were electrocuted. Wu died instantly due to the severity of the electric shock. Dabao was rescued with wooden objects and escaped danger. She was immediately sent to the Wuxi Sanatorium for treatment. The bodies of Liu Zhongchen and others were hastily coffined and buried after being examined by the court after a report.</p>

<p>▲ Peddling Japanese Cloth, Paraded Through the Streets as a Warning: On the morning of the 16th, Lu Fei, a member of the County Anti-Japanese Association, discovered a vendor shouting and selling Japanese cloth along County Front Street. After questioning, it was learned that the vendor's name was Chen Delong, from Haimen, Jiangsu. He arrived in Shanghai on the sixth day of the fifth lunar month. There were four or five hundred people traveling with him.

<p>Mr. Zhu's words made me understand somewhat. However, I still could not deduce what impact the theory of action-producing knowledge would have on our school, so I asked Mr. Zhu to explain it to the end. Mr. Zhu said: "This school of ours is fundamentally different from traditional schools. Traditional schools are like abalone canning companies. Students are like individual cans. Teachers are like canning workers. Pseudo-knowledge is like the stinky fish put in the cans, not cooked, not sterilized, pleasing to the eye but causing nausea and diarrhea and costing one's life if eaten. How can you blame people for throwing away the cans along with the fish! But this canning company is an old shop, bearing the signboard written by the saints and sages of all generations. I won't say anything else, just take Wang Yangming's theory of 'unity of knowledge and action' to discuss it, and you will know that the roots of traditional schools are very deep. He said: 'Knowledge is the beginning of action, and action is the completion of knowledge.' These two sentences represent the educational method of traditional schools. We spend ten or five years in school to do the work of 'knowing' well, and then go outside the school to 'act.' According to the traditional method, if you want to learn to swim, you listen to lectures on swimming in the classroom, read books on swimming in the library, and when it comes to the final exam, you write an essay on swimming and get 70 points to pass, or 100 points to be considered a swimming champion. Who can deny you? Your school has a philosophical basis of knowing before acting, your exam papers have the double circles of PhDs, and your diplomas have the seal of the Ministry of Education. Who can deny you? But you have to be careful, the Dragon King only recognizes skills, not diplomas. If the Da Da steamship catches fire and you are a passenger on board, that will really be a big swimming test. Good, traditional schools must be torn down. Wang Yangming's 'Knowledge is the beginning of action' has to do half a somersault. What is half a somersault? Sun Wukong's somersault is 108,000 miles. He is standing on the palm of Buddha's hand and doing somersaults, and after doing one, he is still standing. Doing one somersault draws 360 degrees, and half a somersault draws 180 degrees, which is exactly upside down. Our theory should be like this:</p>
<p>'Action is the beginning of knowledge, and knowledge is the completion of action.'</p>
<p>We must pursue true knowledge through action. When action encounters difficulties, we cannot help but think. When thought is thorough, we obtain true knowledge. Using true knowledge to act, we embark on the path of creation. Today's school is a place to seek knowledge through action. With the courage to act, we can have the harvest of true knowledge, and the possibility of creation."</p>

<p>— Fangzhou</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Qiang, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army. He worked diligently in planning strategies and mediating disputes during this war of resistance against Japan and the ceasefire conference. Recently, as the 19th Route Army is about to be transferred to Fujian, he came to Suzhou to preside over everything. President Liao of Suzhou Agricultural School invited him to give a lecture at the school a few days ago. Fortunately, he agreed. Mr. Huang usually doesn't smile easily. On that day, he spoke eloquently for two hours. And his words were witty and humorous, and he emphasized the harm of internal warfare. Those who heard it were moved. Excerpts are below, worthy of the title "quick words."</p>
<p>Mr. Huang recounted his history, saying that he graduated from a French school at the age of sixteen. At the age of eighteen, he served as a translator for the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Bureau. Because of his anger at the unreasonableness of the French, he abandoned it and went to Guangdong to study the army. Later, he went north and graduated from the Baoding Military Academy. After returning to Guangdong, he served as a lower-ranking officer and participated in the campaign against Yuan Shikai. Later, he fled overseas due to a political change. He studied agriculture and industry in France and aviation in England. After returning to China, he served as the principal of an industrial school and ran a bee farm, chicken farm, and farm, etc. All of them failed due to the impact of internal warfare. However, he never lost heart. Later, he developed Hainan Island, with great plans. He had achieved a lot in twenty months, but his efforts were ruined by a political change. Therefore, he has been engaged in social service for thirty years and has been in the military for twenty years. If calculated according to the example of trade associations, all sectors of agriculture, industry, military, and education can be joined. However, he still has to wear this military uniform and has not been able to find a position in the industrial and agricultural sectors. All because of the impact of internal warfare.</p>
<p>He also said that the result of internal warfare has led to today's poverty and weakness. All taxes are used for military expenses. And in the country, in addition to rampant bandits, the army also disturbs the people wherever it goes. Therefore, bandit areas and places affected by war can be described in a few idioms, namely, "chickens and dogs are not alarmed, nothing is picked up on the road, and doors are not closed at night." Why? Because bandits come like combing and soldiers come like raking. The dogs are all gone, of course, they are not alarmed. Houses are in ruins, nothing can be picked up. There is nothing in the house, so there is no need to close the door. Moreover, military needs are vast, so they must be taken from exorbitant taxes. Therefore, fields are planted with poppies, almost becoming a flower kingdom. For example, villagers who carry goods into the city to sell have a goods tax in the countryside and a landing tax in the city. Passing through the school gate, there is an education tax. Passing through the police station gate, there is a public security tax. Passing through the security group gate, there is a local security tax. Layer upon layer of exploitation finally makes the person abandon the goods and flee. Therefore, Chinese affairs today are not impossible to do. You only need to stop the internal warfare, make the people rich, and then educate them. When I was stationed in Hainan Island, I first spent four months clearing out the communists, then built roads and reclaimed land, and finally checked household registrations and implemented the baojia system. After more than a year, Hainan was well-governed. Every holiday, I went out on horseback alone, stopping a passerby and asking his name, hometown, address, etc., and then checked it against the accompanying register of the township. If what he said was untrue, it would be suspicious. I was able to achieve true "nothing is picked up on the road, and doors are not closed at night." Therefore, government is not about saying more. Being able to recognize the goal and bury yourself in doing it will definitely lead to results. In Hainan Island for twenty months, I never posted a single slogan.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang finally solemnly stated that because he felt the harm of internal warfare, the 19th Route Army will never fire a single bullet internally from now on. Externally, even if there is only one soldier and one soldier left, they will resist to the end.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Crying for Teacher Feng Huifeng <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— ·Ju· Mo</p>
<p>During the Gengzi and Xinchou years of the Guangxu era, the teacher served as a school official in Lishui County for more than two years. At that time, I was not yet twenty years old. In Bingwu, I came from Hangzhou to Cixi to visit the teacher at his residence. On the Qingming Festival in March of Renshen, I and his family paid respects to the teacher's tomb in the northwest corner of Lake Ci. The grass was already lush. Recalling the past thirty years, it was like a dream. I lowered my head and looked around, not knowing where the tears came from. I got a poem that said: "Events of thirty years ago, all come to mind. I was fifteen or sixteen years old, once swept the jade steps. Wandering in Du Fu's old study, rising to Wu Gong's Terrace. Closing the door to copy poems and articles, not knowing whether I was talented or not. After copying, I took them away, and the teacher knew without a doubt. Sometimes he looked at me and smiled, 'This child's heart is still young.' After leaving, almost ten years passed, studying in Laohuai. (The teacher lived in Cixi Laohuashu Mentou, and there was an old locust tree at the door). From then on, on rainy nights, I often accompanied him in the empty room. If I didn't see him for three days, he would urge me with poems. He often said in sadness, 'My laughter is for you.' I am ashamed of being Yang Gonghe, only accompanying the world in vain. Suddenly thirty years have passed, the child of the past is now old. Last year I was sick, and I heard the teacher dreamt of snakes and vipers. I struggled to cross the sea, and my mind was gray. Before parting, he held my hand, 'How many times can we meet?' I held back my tears, not daring to let them fall, saying that there would be no future disasters. Eleven months after parting, Mount Tai collapsed. Thousands of people cannot redeem it, and a coffin is buried on the mountain's edge. The celestial sphere and jade balance are left to the weeds forever. Today, I worship at the tomb door, and the spiritual wind blows the wine cup. I have already walked away, but I look back, covering my sleeves with lingering sorrow. (Unaccepted reward)"</p>
<h3 id="e128">Touring Chongming in the Rain <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Dingming</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yousheng Travel Group has been established for many years. It is divided into small groups such as national music, national art, art, national sound, library, and travel. Among them, the library is a quiet promotion of mass culture, and travel is a dynamic study of natural science. The 12th was the date for the travel group to tour Chongming Island. On this day, the sky was overcast and it rained heavily. However, they still went in the rain. The situation on the day is recorded to mark the footprints.</p>
<p>▲Boat Arrangement: A large ship was rented, which could accommodate more than 500 people. Some did not come because of the rain. Some temporarily joined. There were about 300 people in total. The boat arrangement was quite spectacular. Two large flags with the Yousheng Group emblem were erected on the top of the boat. On the right side of the hull, eleven round lead plates with a diameter of three feet, painted with white characters on a black background, were suspended at parallel intervals. The characters on them read: "Yousheng Travel Group Direct Chartered Boat to Chongming." The boat was three stories high. Everywhere, up and down, left and right, were plastered with the words "[Youth travel helps education], [Adult travel increases experience]," and "[Travel is a method for seeking knowledge, seeking knowledge promotes national evolution]." These are probably the group's motto.</p>
<p>▲Views of the Shanghai-Ying Sea: Mr. Shao Woyun said, "[Chongming Island was formerly known as Yingzhou. The scenery along the way from Shanghai directly to Chongming, passing through the Pujiang River and the sea, is worth seeing everywhere. It is a pity that the ruins of Wusong are broken and unbearable, shocking to the eye. Although the rain is erratic, it is still a feast for the eyes. There are no less than hundreds of warships and ships from various countries on the Pujiang River, connected end to end. In the Yunzao Creek, there are countless sailboats, which are commonly known as the water rickshaws. All of them have triangular red cloths tied high on the masts. Looking back at Pudong, the green fields fill the eyes, adding to the joy of the trip. The wheel crosses the Three Gorges, and suddenly the waves are turbulent, and the sea and sky are vast. It is another natural picture. The wheel docks on Chongming Island. Looking at the wild scenery of Haimen on the opposite bank from afar, the clouds and fog are hazy and vaguely discernible. There are dozens of fishing boats in front, like dragonflies skimming lightly on the water. As it flows back, the wheel gets farther and the island gets smaller. It is also like a golden cicada swimming dragon, lively and knowing people's minds and sending us off. Then the clouds cleared and the sky cleared. Colorful clouds flew for about four hours. Floating into the Pujiang River, to the vicinity of Gaoxing Temple and Jun Gong Road. The sea lights are shining, shining into a mirage. All of this is a rare water town landscape."</p>
<h3 id="e129">Trivial Notes on Health Preservation by an Old Man of Ninety-Three <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Jingqing</p>
<p>The noise and dust of Shanghai are very harmful to the years. Therefore, there are not many old people. It is heard that in Kaixian County of Sichuan Province, there is an old man named Li Qingyun, who has reached the age of two hundred and sixty. It is a fact and can be called the giant of longevity in the universe. He has a close relationship with a famous lawyer from Shanghai, Mr. Tan. I was introduced by a friend's letter and was given a photo of the old man. His fingernails are more than a foot long, his forehead is broad and he has no beard, and his eyes are bright. He is indeed a sign of longevity. It is said that this old man is skilled in the ways of Han Kang. At the age of seventy, he climbed mountains. He inadvertently ate some kind of herb and suddenly felt his body stronger than ever. That's how he reached today. It is a pity that I have not been able to get the details. Let's talk about Mr. Xiang's health preservation.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang has no煩恼 of desires and no disturbance of family. His diet and living habits are all based on scientific rules. He is opposed to the old Chinese health preservation methods and the theories of Zheng Taozhai and others. But he is also different from the health methods of Okuma Shigenobu and Wu Zhirong. Wu and Okuma boasted of living to be a hundred years old, but they only left behind exaggerated words.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang never eats porridge or rice. He only eats milk, half-cooked chicken eggs (or pigeon eggs), chicken juice, beef juice, and a small amount of bread for three meals a day. He never eats vegetables rich in fiber because they hinder the stomach wall of the elderly and are difficult to digest. For domestic tonics, he only occasionally takes cinnamon oil and white fungus. Although he sometimes drinks ginseng soup, he does not consider it a necessity. He only drinks a small amount of wine with each meal, or takes digestive tablets. He must eat two or three kinds of fruits between lunch and dinner to aid digestion. Among the fruits, he especially likes mangoes, apples, tangerines, pears, etc. He always cuts bananas into the milk and eats them together. He always rinses his mouth and brushes his teeth after meals, and then drinks lemon tea or tea to remove grease. He usually likes to eat (based on physiological theories) honey, green onions, garlic, and wild lilies, etc.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang once said that there were many long-lived people in ancient Jewish times because they often ate honey, green onions, garlic, etc. In recent years, Western doctors have generally advocated eating green onions, garlic, etc. regularly, which can strengthen the body, especially for those who are weak. Even comparing Northerners and Southerners, most Northerners are stronger, which can be used as evidence. Mr. Xiang also said that Caucasians are mostly over ninety years old because they often eat lactic acid cakes, which can eliminate harmful E. coli and prolong life. As for the Cantonese eating snake meat, he said it is quite in line with science and can treat skin diseases because it has the power to eliminate filth in the body. He highly praised the modern popular meditation method, but he has not practiced it.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang goes to bed around 9 pm every night. He gets up at dawn, washes and dresses, and goes to the church to recite scriptures and attend Mass, which is his habit. In cold weather, even when the sky is still dark, he must get up early on time, just to go to the church to recite scriptures. In this way, mundane thoughts are washed away, and the heart is at peace. This is also a major reason for enjoying longevity. However, since the rampant Japanese pirates, the pain of national subjugation has often overflowed his words, showing his deep concern for the country.</p>
<p>He often sleeps for one or two hours after lunch to nourish his spirit and aid digestion. He lives on the third floor, where the sunlight and air are good. The building faces green fields, which can relieve eye strain. Looking at the Jiufeng Mountains in the distance, the scenery is pleasant. Leaning on the railing, he enjoys the greenery, and the beauty extends his years. The doors and windows are covered with green gauze to block mosquitoes and flies. He must bathe every day in the hot summer, and even in the cold winter, he must bathe every three days. He rarely exercises, just like Yang Tieya in his later years who did not go downstairs. (A doctor said that if Mr. Xiang could pay attention to exercise after his prime, his physical strength would be stronger.) He sits surrounded by books, never letting go of the books in his hand. He loves learning and is far beyond my reach.</p>
<h3 id="e130">A Glimpse of the Qingdao Aquarium <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Junren</p>
<p>The Qingdao Aquarium is built in the middle section of the seaside park. It faces the sea and backs onto the road. The exterior resembles a city wall, magnificent and imposing. Visitors must purchase a ticket for one dime. The center is an open-air courtyard with two fountains that spray water like pearls and jade, which is very interesting. On both sides are display areas for various aquatic species, protected by glass. Inside are stored water, stones, sand, grass, etc., resembling the glass windows of a shop. Each window contains one, two, or three or four types of aquatic animals. Starfish and flounder are rarely seen by people, so they attract the most attention. The shape of a starfish is like a water chestnut, with five corners and gold and white spots on a blue background, which is quite beautiful. However, viewers cannot discern the location of its mouth and eyes, because its shape is round and it is dull and immobile. The flounder is oval in shape, but if we look at it casually, it is only a thin piece of paper, floating up and down, and we cannot see any other body parts. At the end of each aquatic display area on both sides is a large glass room, containing an old dragon, nearly ten feet long. One can imagine that when it lives in the water, it can stir up waves and is fierce and unparalleled. Another room contains specimens of various aquatic species. There are many types of coral, with different names and styles. The establishment of an aquarium in our country is probably the first of its kind. It is said that the cost was quite high. With this construction in the seaside park, the number of visitors will increase even more.</p>

<p>Liang Xiaoyun also stopped these meticulous and affected gestures, and only pulled An Yutian aside to talk about serious matters, saying, "You really don't need to worry anymore. Those people at the Adjutant's Office, don't be fooled by their military officer airs. They all look like human beings, but in reality, they are all extremely lowly errand runners. They just want to find someone to ask for some money. If you have money, you can get them to move. You thought it was right to go through them in a dignified manner to see Old Ye. But since you have to pass through their hands, you have to get them to obediently run errands and deliver your card. This, like the 'door money' movement fee, absolutely cannot be saved. It's better to give it to them straightforwardly and earn some face. Why risk being reckless and barging in, letting them look down on you? The reason I was complaining about you just now was because I didn't want you to be mistreated by them for nothing. Now that things have come to this, you have to get that face back properly. It's inevitable that you'll have to add a little more to the usual amount, and then it'll be over. Tomorrow, I'll have Little Mao come over and tell him to handle it for you. Once it's settled, I guarantee your next visit won't be with that kind of face. Spending a little money has its worth. It's not some kind of unreasonable thing. For example, the male and female servants in our house, who doesn't want to find extra income and earn some pocket money? If we go to other people's mansions for social engagements, we also have to give out some tips. It's just that there's a difference in status and influence. The Adjutant Officer relies on the power of the Military Governor to demand more and be more aggressive. We understand human nature and must follow the customs. We should be more accommodating and generous, so that these subordinates are happy. As the ancients said, 'A small impatience spoils great plans.' Doing great things also requires not being stingy with small expenses." These words made An Yutian admire her greatly, and naturally he no longer cared. The next day, Mao Deshun arrived after receiving a phone call. Liang Xiaoyun completely entrusted him to clear things up and asked him to deliver the gifts. She tore off two bank checks, one for four hundred yuan and one for two hundred yuan, and handed them to Mao Deshun, saying, "This four hundred yuan is solely for Adjutant Wan. Please also ask Adjutant Wan to distribute the two hundred yuan to everyone in the Adjutant's Office as a small token of appreciation. Please ask them to help Councilor An more in the future when he goes to see the Military Governor. When I arrived here, I had already mentioned to Councilor An that we should send them this customary fee. It's just that I've been busy playing mahjong with Fifth Madam these past two days, so I was delayed."</p>

<h3 id="e132">Another Big Drop in Foreign Currency <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview: In the past few days, foreign currency has risen sharply for several days in a row, arousing the excitement of the general public. Outsiders have all determined that there is a tendency for it to flourish. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday afternoon, it softened again, greatly disappointing everyone. And yesterday morning, a big drop reappeared, with the authorities unable to save it and only able to let it take its course. Eventually, the downward trend became rampant again. The difference between the two markets reached four cents, and a kind of decadent atmosphere has revived and is still in full swing. Alas, the market sentiment is not to be trusted.</p>
<p>▲ Currency Exchange Price: [Foreign Currency] The morning market was extraordinarily weak, with a strong selling atmosphere. Banks also sold more and bought less, causing the currency price to plummet again, reaching 69.5 cents, a drop of about three cents. The afternoon market continued to fall slightly by one cent, to 69.4 cents. The total drop in the two markets was 3.875 cents. [Silver Exchange] The morning and afternoon markets totaled nine cents, slightly better than the previous day by one cent, but the trend was very loose. Therefore, the "scratch head" (extra commission) increased, from several cents to a "blank scratch," and the situation was very loose and unregulated.</p>
<p>▲ Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small silver dollars: The morning and afternoon markets had few buyers and sellers, so competition was also sluggish, and the prices were the same at 60.5 cents, the same as the previous day. Only 2,000 *jiao* were traded in the morning market. Guangdong small silver dollars: Due to the exchange rate relationship, it was difficult to maintain its position when foreign currency fell, so it had to follow suit. The morning market was 59.5 cents, and the afternoon market was 59.25 cents, resulting in a large drop of 0.3 cents. The trading volume in the morning market was 120,000 *jiao*, and in the afternoon market was 40,000 *jiao*. Copper coins suddenly shrank by 3,000 *wen*, to 416,000 *wen*.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: [Silver Funds] Yesterday's news about bank receipts and payments was still the same as usual, with no significant changes. Chinese merchants received and paid 2.56 million in bills, foreign merchants received and paid over 1.9 million in bills, and the receipts and payments for foreign exchange, customs duties, import and export bills, telegraph fees, etc., amounted to 9.45 million. Chinese merchants deposited 500,000 into warehouses, foreign merchants withdrew 600,000 from warehouses, and the single receipts and payments of money shops and silver firms amounted to over 27.7 million. The receipts and payments of "scratch head" funds amounted to over 4.6 million. The receipts and payments of remittances from various routes amounted to over 500,000, and cash receipts amounted to over 300,000. [Foreign Funds] The morning market for exchange and bill payments reached 885,000, and the afternoon market reached 675,000. Banknotes in the morning market were 50,000, and in the afternoon market were 10,000. Outside the market, banknotes in the morning market were 95,000, and in the afternoon market were 80,000. Check transactions in the morning market were 40,000, and in the afternoon market were 35,000. Bank trading: inter-bank trading in the morning market was 700,000, and in the afternoon market was 600,000. The receipts and payments between foreign accounts of various banks amounted to 1.78 million. Banknote inflow and outflow amounted to over 1.1 million. The single receipts and payments of foreign firms of money shops amounted to 7.3 million. The foreign "scratch head" funds amounted to over 1.9 million. Interbank lending of foreign funds amounted to over 900,000, and small money shop transactions amounted to over 800,000.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The State of the Financial World After the Settlement <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>After the financial circles of this city concluded the account settlement for the 20th year at the end of last month (May), it was originally expected that they would engage in expanding their business and making efforts to proceed this month, in order to make up for the right to missed business opportunities in the first half of the year. Therefore, in the past two weeks, they have been quite busy with the formalities of distributing account books and establishing accounts. Unfortunately, the overall situation of the entire commercial sector in Shanghai is generally desolate after the disaster, and the economy is exhausted. If they want to develop as much as possible, they are too afraid of the risk. If they intend to choose cautiously, it is indeed an extremely difficult problem for the current shops to raise cash and make up for credit. Therefore, those who want to lend dare not try easily, and those who seek lending have no way to invite people to guarantee their credit. It is still the case that there is a surplus but no adjustment, a deficiency but no filling, and unevenness between fullness and lack, which is probably rarely seen in history. Observing this, the joys and sorrows of commerce this summer and autumn can be witnessed under this situation. Can its depression be described again?</p>
<h3 id="e134">Slight Changes in Gold Bidding <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>▲ Spot: A certain bank is still buying. Yesterday's gold bidding showed slight changes, trending towards decline. Fellow traders were at a loss, and in the end, they broke even. The former market was still level, with only about four taels of fluctuation. Initially, it rose due to a sharp decline in foreign exchange, but the silver market did not move, not taking it seriously. Afterwards, there were slight advances and retreats, and then sellers became diligent. When foreign exchange turned loose again, it was even rumored that Japan had shipped a large amount of gold coins to the United States. The market used this to go downstream, and the subsequent fluctuations were not small, even hovering around seven taels. Initially, a selling atmosphere permeated, and it once broke 720 taels. The exchange rate changed from deficient to good, and because a certain bank was buying spot goods, people's hearts turned firm, and it soared, leaping to six or seven taels. Buyers were brave. As for the short positions that had not been closed out in July before the rollover, there were still 12,000 to 13,000 contracts, and Qian Changxiang and Yi Fengyong were the most numerous, with about 3,000 to 4,000 contracts each. However, Da Decheng and Tong Taichang each had more than 1,000 contracts. It is said that Run Changyu had about 3,000 contracts. The rest were retail investors. Yesterday, it was heard that Hengxing and other short positions and Yuan Xingyong long positions had rolled over 500 to 600 contracts, and the short positions still posted seven taels, etc. The situation in yesterday's market is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Not much fluctuation in the morning: The opening price for August in the morning was 1.6 *qian* higher, at 726.3 taels. The large strips did not change much. However, the exchange rate suddenly decreased by more than 0.1 yuan, and people's hearts were still good. It was learned that the private telegram silver price was reported as 1/16 higher, and Hengyu, Hengxing, Bingxing, etc., were all selling, so it was immediately cut by two taels, to 24.2 *qian*. Soon after, Zhifengyong, Bingxing, Hengxing, etc., entered again, and the US dollar was still stable. Fellow traders slightly closed in, July 30.625, and October English gold was paired at 1.825, and July was settled at 1.25, so it returned high by more than one tael, 9:15 was 25.8 *qian*. Then, Yuan Maoyong, Fuyu, etc., sold, and it decreased by one tael to 24.8 *qian*. When the English gold announcement was as usual, the US dollar was reduced by 0.125 because the exchange rate was squeezed small. The intraday also saw a return to level, with a profit of absorbing the month at 5.625, and Huabi absorbing English gold at 0.0625. Therefore, the gold price gradually went upstream, but only with a few *qian* of ups and downs. Fuxingyong, Hong Kangyong, Bingxing, Wupin, Yifengyong all entered. At 10:30, it was 25.9 *qian*. Afterwards, it was slightly inferior by a few *qian*. After 11:00, Da Decheng, Yifengyong, Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Tai, Fuyu, Richang, Futai, Xiang, etc., all sold, and the foreign exchange market loosened again. Fellow traders threw out English gold, counted August 1.875 to 2.5, and the US dollar forward price was 31.3125 yuan, not easy to sell. It was also rumored that Japanese gold was being shipped to the United States, so the price plummeted by two or three taels, until 11:45, it was only 22.5 taels. After entering, retail investors bought in, pulling up 1.2 *qian*, but it seemed that there were not a few short positions sold, so the afternoon closing was still 22.6 taels. ▲ The afternoon's ups and downs were not small: The afternoon market opened at 22.8 *qian*, followed by a few *qian* of ups and downs. However, Fuyu, Da Decheng, Yifengyong, Hong Kangyong, Zhaofengchang, etc., all had sales, and English gold was quite strong. HSBC came out with November 1.8375, Shanghai bought October US dollars at 31.375 yuan, so the gold price depreciated by more than three taels, 2:30 suddenly became 19.2 *qian*, and in an instant it returned to a calm state. Because Mitsui bought October US dollars at 3.125, and Mai Xing bought September English gold at 3.125, and July at 2.5, then November Xiangjie 3.125, and the sellers on the surface were cut off, but the buyers followed one after another.

Also, about 450,000 yuan in US dollars, slightly pulled in the morning, and then came out in the afternoon.

<h3 id="e137">Bond Prices Had Mixed Ups and Downs <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 17th), the bond market situation on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange: the spot market was still quiet, with only 23,000 yuan opened throughout the day. Among them, the "20 Customs" accounted for 10,000 yuan, and the rest only accounted for a few thousand yuan. The futures market was also very quiet, with a total of 3.37 million yuan opened in the morning and afternoon. Among them, the "20 Customs" and consolidated tax each accounted for more than 700,000 yuan, the salt tax accounted for about 600,000 yuan, and others such as the "20 Cut Troops," "19 Customs Charity" only accounted for 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. The "Whole Six Customs Tax" and "96 Compiled Estates," etc., were even quieter. As for the trend of bond prices in various directions, since there was no new development in the bond market environment, large investors were more cautious, the market situation was quiet, and the supply and demand situation was balanced. Therefore, although the bond prices in the front and back markets changed constantly, they were all trapped in a revolving state, with no major ups and downs from beginning to end. As a result, except for the "20 Customs" and the consolidated tax, which were lower than before by about one yuan, the "Cut Troops" futures for July rose by 0.75 yuan, and the "Whole Six" current month futures were slightly lower by 0.7 yuan, the others had mixed ups and downs, only about 0.1 or 0.2 yuan.

<p>(American East Silver Company Report)</p>
<p>The New York stock market was very quiet on Thursday, and the market conditions did not change much. Because there was no new development in the economic world, people's hearts were quite stable, so after the rise in the previous two days, there was no reaction. Railway stocks were relatively strong, rising a few points compared to the previous day. Industrial and public utility stocks fell slightly. After the House of Representatives passed the Veterans' Bonus Act, it was heard that the report of the Senate Finance Committee did not express approval, which was beneficial and harmless to the stock market. It is expected that even if the bill is passed by Congress in the future, the White House will still reject it. The reason why railway stocks are trending strong is that there is hope that the freight tonnage will increase. The continued progress of the stock market in the future will be after Congress closes. The Dow Jones Index is attached as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market situation, the decline is fierce, today's decline is all caused by the previous day. The general psychology of this city, because the price has been low, the thought of buying and doing more has not been cut off, but the domestic economic bankruptcy and rural decline are closely related to cotton yarn. Moreover, world prices have plummeted, and overseas yarn prices are particularly cheap. Therefore, a part of them is unusually pessimistic and tends to sell short, and it is feared that there will be special changes in the future.</p>
<p>▲ Human Standard fell 2.7 taels. At the opening of the Human Standard front market, because there were not many buyers in the market, the market gradually fell, and the situation was particularly panicked. Each month fell by 1.5, 0.9, and 0.1 *qian*. In the afternoon, it was heard that Japanese merchants were selling yarn fiercely in Sifang, and people's hearts were even more empty, each falling by 0.6, 0.9, and 0.8 *qian*. According to the statistics of the whole day's transactions, 30,300 bales were traded. Xincheng 1,700 bales, Tongfu 600 bales, Mingde 650 bales, Deji 1,350 bales, Yichang 800 bales, Xinda 600 bales. Rongxing bought 1,500 bales, Taichang 950 bales, Changfeng 2,050 bales, Gengfeng 1,250 bales, Shenchang 900 bales. The closing prices of the Human Standard are listed as follows:</p>

<p>September 1427 24 45,250</p>
<p>▲ Spot Yarn Also Fell by 1 Taels Outside Spot Yarn Still Has Sluggish Clearance. According to the survey, the various gangs bought a total of 650 bales, and 42 bales were imported by the same industry. Foreign gangs imported 370 bales from Yunnan, 5 bales from Ningbo, 45 bales from Jiangxi, 60 bales from Guangdong, 5 bales from Fujian, and 120 bales from the interior, it is said.</p>

<p>The cotton market is very sluggish, and the price decline has returned. This is because the actual demand is stagnant, and the American cotton market is calm. Furthermore, various factories purchased as much foreign cotton as possible last year and have sufficient storage. Currently, they have no intention of activity. Therefore, fundamentally, it is still difficult to be good. However, cotton merchants in this port, because their base is already small, still have a strong inclination to go long. Therefore, the market trend is still relatively flat. But according to the general trend, there will be great changes in the future. Moreover, the northern road inventory is abundant, and most of it has not been shipped out. Therefore, Xincheng, a large account, is determined to sell off, and the future is not promising.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Biao's Plunge of 65 Copper Coins: At the opening of the Zheng Biao pre-market, there was a lack of buyers in the market, and prices for all months fell sharply by 56 copper coins. The afternoon opening fell again, and the closing rebounded, resulting in a flat finish. The total transaction volume for the day was 62,000 dan. It was found that Xincheng sold 4,400 dan, Jifeng 2,000 dan, Gengfeng 3,500 dan, and Yiyu 1,900 dan. Hengde bought 3,900 dan, Changfeng 1,700 dan, Dachang 1,500 dan, and Yichang 1,300 dan. The closing prices of Zheng Biao are listed below:</p>

<p>August 28.50 - 65 105,800</p>
<p>Total 446,500</p>
<p>▲ Current Cotton Opens at 800 Bales: Current cotton sales are sluggish, and futures cotton has turned into a price decline again. The hearts of people who had just settled down from a respite suddenly experienced another sharp drop, and the yarn market is becoming increasingly pessimistic. Therefore, the recovery in the past two days is almost like a flash in the pan.</p>

<p>Zhengzhou News: New cotton planting is progressing well. Since the beginning of spring, the climate has been mild. After the cotton was sown, the weather was favorable, and the development was very good. According to previous predictions, a bumper cotton harvest is expected in Zhengzhou.</p>
<p>The cotton business tax collected by the Zhengzhou Cotton Exchange, 70 copper coins per bale, expired on the first of this month. Therefore, the Henan Provincial Government has issued an order to abolish it, and no further collection is allowed from now on.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to a pest report, but later weakened due to profit-taking and poor spot demand. Futures prices rose or fell by 1-3 points, while spot prices remained unchanged. American cotton futures rose by 6-9 points, spot prices rose by 3 points, Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points, and Indian cotton was closed.

<p>▲ In the southern part of Shanghai yesterday, about 20 ships from various gangs arrived, and there were more than 200 warehouses in Puxi. Sales in urban and rural shops are difficult to develop due to tight finances. It is also heard that Xinzha is cheaper, and appetites are congested. Thick japonica fresh material has fallen sufficiently. However, the intermediate and late maturing rice has fallen by another 20 copper coins. The demand for early and late rice is very small, and the price has also been reduced. Luxiang indica rice arrivals and sales are both sluggish, and the market continues to be dull.</p>
<p>▲ In the northern part of Shanghai yesterday, Tou Nian No. 3 and 4 from Xinzha Suzhou River arrived. The opening in the morning was limited in its ups and downs. The goods from Xiyi were firmly priced, while the secondary goods were slightly weaker. Although there was not much thin rice, the price remained at the original level. The change in the Yin Yuan market was neither good nor bad. Another round of foreign rice arrived, about 50,000. The customer's appetite was slightly lower, and the local street was dull, causing prices to gradually decline.</p>

<p>▲ Rice stocks are approaching 20,000 bags... Foreign rice sales are sluggish... Continuing to be nearly a corner lower</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was weak in both customer demand and rice arrivals. Rice stocks are full, and there are still many orders. Foreign merchants in the market also have futures for sale. Although no new transactions have been agreed upon, the market and people's hearts have been brought down. The market price of returned goods is also low, and there are no buyers asking about it. Therefore, the spot price continues to be nearly a corner lower. Yesterday, only 200 bags of red large twisted rice were handled by inland offices, priced at 9 yuan and 45 cents. Local and rural offices handled 1,000 bags of small twisted rice, priced at 10 yuan and 02 to 10 yuan and 05 cents. There were no other transactions. The sales of Wenzhou rice have been very good recently, with sales occurring immediately upon arrival. There is no inventory in the market. Recently, merchants have gradually been arriving, and sales have been sluggish. Another batch arrived yesterday, and the city already has close to 20,000 bags in stock. Yesterday, only 340 bags were handled by the local street, and the price fell to over 10 yuan. It is said that the opening price was only 9 yuan and 70 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Flour Market Continues to Decline <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>▲ Actual Sales Have Not Yet Developed</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for all months uniformly showed a sharp decline. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat did not fluctuate much, the actual sales were unusually weak, and the new wheat was particularly cheap. Although the major factories are still selling spot flour at a loss, the internal and external environment is tending towards stagnation. It seems that the poor economic situation cannot be saved by human power. After the price increase, actual sales could be triggered, then the situation would be transformed. Now, the large-scale sales market has not yet developed. Therefore, it is gradually declining due to natural trends (it is heard that inland manufacturers have dumped goods). The afternoon price for July even broke through the 5-fen mark, and it may return to 80 cents. As a result, the price for July fell by 1 fen and 7.5 li compared to the previous day, the price for August fell by 1 fen and 5 li, the price for September fell by 2 fen, the price for October fell by 2 fen and 2.5 li, and the price for November fell by 2 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Wheat Market Still Weak <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>▲ New Wheat Continues to Arrive, Not Yet Opened</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market prices for all months generally tended to be flat and weak. Although the trend is still not good and the market value of new wheat in the interior is still cheap, local dealers have slightly increased their purchases, and inland gangs are also gradually reducing their positions. Therefore, the supply and demand are evenly matched, and the market atmosphere is relatively stable. However, due to sluggish flour sales, the overall situation is still not good and remains weak. Looking at the next step, if the interior gradually collects cash to hedge, and the factories have no intention of buying, the outcome may still be a small trend. As a result, the price for July was 2 fen lower than the previous day, the price for August was unchanged, the price for September was 2 fen lower, the price for October was 1 fen lower, and the price for November was 2 fen lower. New wheat continues to arrive, but the factories are inactive and have not yet opened for business.</p>

<p>▲ European Sales Suddenly Rise, Grade B Price Rises to Over 500 Taels</p>
<p>▲ The Effect of Manufacturers' Persistence, Up 40-50 Taels</p>
<p>Overseas: The sales of white factory silk are sluggish and the price is weak, reaching its extreme point. The price of Grade B has fallen to 420 taels (American market) and 60 taels (French market), with no buyers. The factories all believe that the losses are too great and insist on not selling. Silk sales have been stagnant for a long time. Recently, 100,000 bales of old Japanese silk have been purchased by the Japanese government. After this, raw materials will become scarce. The silk stocks in Lyon are insufficient, and various silk merchants and hoarders have started to buy futures and spot silk. Silk sales in New York are also starting to move, and the market atmosphere has become lively. Chinese merchants' attitude has become more firm. Yesterday, Xinfu Dachang Lianna and other companies imported 140 bales of Grade B top-grade 13-15 filature Shanghai white factory silk spot goods, priced at 520-530 taels, up 40-50 taels. The market is still expected to rise.</p>

<p>In recent days, the source of Hangzhou green tea has been affected by the mobilization of troops on various routes, and there is a shortage of freight cars between Shanghai and Hangzhou. Cased tea from Anhui and Zhejiang provinces has been accumulated in Hangzhou, reaching a total of 5,000-6,000 cases. The source from the Yangtze River, Qihong tea, has almost run out. Hongcha from Ningzhou in Hubei and Hunan provinces is also scarce. Therefore, only green tea from Wenzhou has arrived in Shanghai in recent days. Tea transactions are also sparse. High-end Qihong tea, Yihua Jinlong and other firms still have sporadic purchases. However, the green tea market is definitely sluggish. Zhenmei and Zhenmei and other items are uniformly trending downwards, and the situation is quite pessimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Sugar Market: Coarse Sugar White Sugar Tends to Fall Again <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's public market trading was still scattered. The price of Dutch No. 24 coarse sugar white sugar fell, with the transaction price at 13 taels and 8 qian, high-quality goods at 13 taels and 9 qian, and Hong Kong goods at 13 taels and 6 qian. Both buying and selling were sluggish, and the market appeared flat. Dutch red No. 8 was at 9 taels and 7 qian, and the trend was still firm. Taikoo refined B Mark was at 16 taels and 1 qian, and CW Mark was at 15 taels and 8 qian and 5 fen. Transactions were also scarce, and the market appeared stable.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Piece Goods: Summer Woolens Continue to Fall <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of woolens was flat. Summer white drill, white Zhigong, paletot, Pantpie, French wool, and feather yarn and other suit fabrics continued to be purchased, but because the market inventory was abundant, the sellers all reduced prices and competed to sell, and the prices were chaotic. Yesterday, Haoshi white Zhigong was sold for 3 taels and 9 qian and 5 fen, Yiji Family Fun white drill was sold for 4 taels and 6 qian, Daoxiancao was sold for 3 taels and 8 qian and 7.5 fen, Anli Pantpie was sold for 2 taels and 3 qian and 5 fen, Xinzongyong Ningfeng Haohua silk stripe paletot was sold for 3 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen, Zhengchang French wool was sold for 2 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen, Hualun suit feather yarn was sold for 2 taels and 9 qian, and Xinji Maolong silk stripe feather yarn was sold for 1 tael and 8 qian and 5 fen, and Hengli was sold for 1 tael and 6 qian.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3 id="e151">White Tung Oil Price Increase Not Yet Over <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>▲ Although Hangzhou is Slightly Weak, the Remote Assistance of Hankou is Strong</p>
<p>Since the source of white tung oil from Hankou has decreased, the situation has turned to rise. Foreign oil companies have also increased prices to 18 taels and 3 qian, which has boosted the market. Dealers' wholesale prices have increased to 15 taels and 2 qian, and then increased by another 3 qian, to 15 taels and 5 qian. Local firms have slightly increased their purchases, but not in large quantities, and the market has become more active. In Hangzhou, due to the scarcity of goods in the production area, the price increased sharply when the Hankou market was weak. However, since the north and south were going in opposite directions, the sales market inevitably declined. Therefore, the highest price was still sold at 29 yuan and 2 jiao per dan. However, the recent Hankou situation has rebounded, and the Hangzhou market has become weaker. According to the details in yesterday's letter, Jinlan and other places sold goods for delivery to Jianggan at 27 yuan and 6 jiao, while the Hangzhou market reported sales to Shanghai at 28 yuan and 4 jiao, which seems to be a slight decrease of several jiao compared to the previous few days. However, since the northern news is good, the strength of the situation in the future is even more predictable.</p>

<p>All Posts Set up in Districts 5, 1, 2 and 3</p>

<p>The Japanese army's occupied area north of the Public Concession, east of the Songhu Railway and North Henan Road, falls under the jurisdiction of Districts 5, 1, 2, and 3. Our takeover committee sent personnel to take over at 10:00 AM yesterday. The Japanese naval landing force stationed on Guangdong Street also withdrew towards Jiangwan Road at the same time. The details of yesterday's takeover are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Takeover Personnel: The takeover personnel included Huang Ming, Director of the Shanghai North Office of the Public Security Bureau; Gong XiKui, Inspector General of the Public Security Bureau; He Yiming, District Chief of District 5; Ju Jing, Chief of Sub-bureau 1 of District 5; Niu Jingjian, Chief of Sub-bureau 2 of District 5; Wu Tingxun, Chief of Sub-bureau 3 of District 5; Yin Tixin, interpreter; and Nan Qiang, Li Shengjun, Liang Fuchu, Jin Gong, and others from the takeover committee, along with Ma Hongbin, Captain of the Beiping Police Brigade, leading more than 300 Beiping police officers, ready to depart.</p>
<p>▲ Taking Over Defense in Separate Routes: The receiving personnel gathered at the Zhabei Office at about 9:00 AM yesterday. At 9:20 AM, they departed in four batches together with the Police Bureau Chief. The first batch received Sub-bureau 1 of District 5, led by Chief Ju Jing, takeover committee special commissioner Huo Shi, Public Security Bureau translator Bao Ju, a squadron of Beiping police, and a squadron of Shanghai police, totaling 252 people. They took nine cars to the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Songhu Railway, and after contacting Japanese representative Lieutenant Yasuda, they crossed North Sichuan Road to the former site of Sub-bureau 1 of District 5 in eastern Qiujiang Road and got off. After a brief rest, the municipal police took over the areas west of the Shajinggang River. A squadron of Beiping police took over the areas along the border of North Sichuan Road. The second batch received Sub-bureau 2 of District 5, led by Chief Niu Jingjian, and takeover committee special commissioner Li Shengjun, led a second police squad of 84 people to receive the area north of Fusheng Road Qiujiang Road, east of the Songhu Railway, and south of Baoxing Road, and set up posts separately.

The fourth batch received the General Office of District 5, led by District Chief He Yiming, takeover committee special commissioners Liang Fuchu and Xie Zhidao, and a police squadron of 126 people to receive Dong Yokohama Road and Doulean Road. The Japanese soldiers completed their withdrawal at 10:00 AM, and our side completed the defense and deployment of posts.</p>
<p>▲ Joint Committee Oversight: The takeover committee sent Jin Gong and Cha Nanqiang, together with Huang Ming, Director of the Zhabei Office of the Public Security Bureau, Gong XiKui, Inspector General, and Yin Tixin, secretary, departed at 9:40 AM, first to Sub-bureau 1 of District 5. After receiving reports that the takeover had been completed everywhere, they took six cars to the headquarters of the Japanese naval landing force on Jiangwan Road at about 10:00 AM. At that time, British military officer Bo Mingte, American military officer Bai Longmu, French military officer Peng Naweite, and Italian military officer Fa Tini from the joint committee had also arrived to supervise the exchange between the two sides.</p>
<p>▲ Signing Situation: Our representatives Huang Ming, etc., along with the military officers from the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, were received by Japanese representative Captain Onuma Tomio, the commander of the Second Battalion of the Naval Special Landing Force. They gathered at a place to inspect the map and explain the withdrawal of the Japanese army and the defense situation on our side. The Japanese side then presented the handover document, which was divided into three articles. Our side requested the deletion of the compensation issue in the third article, which was a political issue (according to the original text of the article, "[regarding the compensation for losses in the following locations, neither of the two countries shall raise negotiations]"). After Jin Gong and Cha Nanqiang, special commissioners of the takeover committee, and Yin Tixin, secretary of the Public Security Bureau, strongly argued with the Japanese side, Onuma took it to another room, crossed out all the clauses in red pen, and affixed a seal, and then brought it back to show our representatives. Our side was satisfied. Then our representative Huang Ming and Japanese representative Onuma saluted each other. The Japanese representative gave a speech, saying that he was pleased that the Japanese army withdrew and handed over to the Chinese takeover today, and that the order was orderly during the handover, and hoped that the friendship between China and Japan would increase. Our representative Huang Ming replied, saying that after our country took over, we would be obliged to seek order in security and defense to protect the residents. Huang Ming and Onuma signed the handover document at 10:30 AM. Finally, Onuma Tomio and our receiving officers and representatives from neutral countries took a group photo as a memento. It was already 12:00 noon. The military officers of neutral countries left first, and Onuma Tomio and others also shook hands and said goodbye to our receiving personnel one by one.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Handover Document: The original text of this document is in Japanese, and the translation is as follows: (1) The Japanese army withdraws from the area north of the Public Concession, east of the Songhu Railway and North Henan Road, and west of the Shajinggang River. The Japanese garrison area outside the extraterritorial road construction is not included. (2) The above locations are handed over by the Japanese side to the Chinese side for takeover. Both sides acknowledge and abide by the above items.

Lieutenant Yasuda set the withdrawal time at 10:00 AM and asked our takeover personnel to wait. Therefore, our side first deployed posts. The 40 or so members of the Japanese Naval Landing Force stationed there withdrew towards Jiangwan Road at 10:00 AM yesterday.

<p>▲ Residents Rejoice: After our police entered the city, they divided into posts and organized patrol teams to patrol in various parts of the district, once every three hours, divided into two shifts each time, with three policemen in each shift. Therefore, the order was very good, and there was no concern for security. When our police arrived, national flags fluttered along the streets, and residents set off firecrackers to warmly welcome them.</p>
<p>▲ End of the Road for Traitors: When the Japanese army in Shajinggang had not yet withdrawn, traitors gathered there, relying on the power of the Japanese. They opened opium dens and stolen goods dens, including Shunli Company at No. 1 Jishanli, Tiantong Road; Zhonghe Company behind Yue Nai Garden, Disiwei Road; Shunli Branch at No. 1 Lane 44, Shajinggang Road; and Jiufu Company at No. 1 Shandefang, Tiantong Road, and many other places.

In addition, there are four locations: Tongwen Academy, Toyota Yarn Factory, Gongda Yarn Factory, and Huafeng Yarn Factory. The Japanese side stated that they could also withdraw from each location, with about 40 or so people, in the next few days.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Wang Jingwei Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Returns to Nanjing by Train the Same Evening</p>
<p>▲ Meets with Song Chen to Make a Final Entreaty</p>
<p>▲ Also Explains the Results of the Lushan Conference</p>
<p>▲ Song Ziwen May Go to Nanjing Soon</p>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei, accompanied by Central Committee member Li Shizeng and his wife Ms. Chen Bijun, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Nanjing at 4:00 PM yesterday. Mr. and Mrs. Wang returned to their residence to rest. At 5:00 PM, Wang went to the Chen residence on Shan Zhong Road to visit Chen Mingshu, detailing the Lushan Conference and firmly urging Chen to resume his duties as soon as possible. Chen declined on the grounds of poor health and the need for temporary recuperation, and there was still no concrete result. After talking for about half an hour, Wang bid farewell. At 8:00 PM last night, Wang went to the Song residence on Qi Qi Road to visit Song Ziwen. In addition to explaining the overall central financial plan decided at the Lushan Conference, he also sought Song's opinion. At that time, Song expressed no objection. Wang then urged Song to go to Nanjing as soon as possible to cancel his leave and resume his duties. Wang left the Song residence at about 9:00 PM. The purpose of this trip to Shanghai was to meet with Mr. Song and Mr. Chen to explain the new plan for military, diplomatic, and financial affairs and to make a final entreaty. At the same time, because government affairs in Nanjing were complicated, he had no time to stay longer. He hurriedly took a special train from Fanhuangdu Station back to Nanjing at 10:20 PM last night. It is said that Song Ziwen has agreed to cancel his resignation after Wang's repeated and earnest request, and he is expected to go to Nanjing to resume his duties in the near future. As for the rumors that the national government will be reorganized and Sun Ke will be appointed as the President of the Executive Yuan, they are mostly speculative.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Gu Weijun <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Flew to Beijing this morning</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday afternoon, banking circles held a banquet to honor him.</p>
<p>▲ In the evening, St. John's University classmates held a welcome dinner.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative of the League of Nations Investigation Team, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing. People from all walks of life, in recognition of Mr. Gu's resolute and arduous journey, have successively held events to express their appreciation. Mr. Gu was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday, but due to the overwhelming kindness of various sectors, he stayed for one more day and decided to take a flight to Beijing this morning to meet with the Investigation Team. The following is a record of Mr. Gu's activities yesterday:</p>
<p>▲ Responded to a banquet by banking circles. Mr. Gu received relatives and friends at home yesterday morning. At 1:15 PM, accompanied by Zhang Xianglin and others, he attended a luncheon hosted by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and leading figures in the banking industry at the Bankers' Club. Those present included Xu Jilou, Qian Xinzhi, Lin Kanghou, Xu Xinliu, Guo Bingwen, Shi Liangcai, and others. Mr. Gu, along with Zhang Xianglin and other guests, totaled about thirty or forty people. During the meal, Qian Xinzhi stood up to deliver a congratulatory speech on behalf of the banking community, followed by Mr. Gu who also gave a speech in response. During the banquet, Mr. Gu provided detailed reports on Northeast China's financial situation. The banquet concluded at 2:30 PM with the guests and hosts parting on amicable terms.</p>
<p>▲ The Alumni Association of St. John's University hosted a dinner. Mr. Gu is an alumnus of St. John's University, and the Alumni Association held a banquet last night at 8:00 PM in the Continental Emporium building to welcome him and express their appreciation. Mr. Gu arrived to a round of applause from all the alumni, shaking hands and exchanging greetings with each classmate. They chatted freely during the meal. Everyone dispersed around 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Flew to Beijing this morning. Mr. Gu, considering that the Investigation Team is scheduled to depart for Japan within days and that his duties are not yet completed, decided to return to Beijing this morning. At 8:30 AM, he took the original flight from Hongqiao Airport to Beijing. After arriving in Beijing, he plans to pay respects to Premier Wang and Minister Luo. In the afternoon, he will fly north from Beijing and is expected to arrive in Beiping around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Decided to accompany the delegation to Japan. During his previous trip outside the customs, Mr. Gu was subjected to threats from rebels in the Northeast. Despite various obstacles upon arriving in the Northeast, he continued to advance with a resolute determination. His spirit and perseverance are truly admirable. As the Investigation Team drafts its report, they decided to begin in Tokyo, Japan, and complete it in Beiping. Mr. Gu, after being urged by key figures such as Chiang and Wang in both Nanjing and Lushan, agreed to accompany the delegation to Japan and has decided to depart for Japan when the Investigation Team leaves Beiping.</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Gu firmly stated that yesterday's news reported a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 16th, which contained threats against Mr. Gu. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Mr. Gu yesterday to inquire about his opinion. According to Mr. Gu's statement to the reporter, he has not yet seen the dispatch. However, this is an issue for the Investigation Team and is unrelated to him personally. As for his acceptance of the government's order to accompany the Investigation Team to Japan, he will maintain his past spirit, not shy away from difficulties, and resolutely accompany the Investigation Team on their trip to Japan. He will fly to Beijing tomorrow morning to meet with Foreign Minister Luo before heading north, as Minister Luo still needs to hold a meeting with the members of the Investigation Team.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives of the National Salvation Association visited. The Shanghai United Association of National Salvation Groups previously held a regular meeting at its premises on Guling Road and appointed Yin Zhiling and Tan Bozhi to visit Mr. Gu to express their appreciation and inquire about diplomatic policies. Mr. Gu personally invited them for a detailed discussion at his residence last night about the diplomatic policies that should be adopted in the future. The association appointed Yin Zhiling, Chu Huiseng, and Li Cishan to visit as agreed and discuss future diplomatic policies with Mr. Gu for about an hour. All possible diplomatic approaches were discussed in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Northeastern Volunteer Army Seeks Assistance <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>▲ Representatives of five route commanders, including Zhang Xingwu, come to Shanghai. Geng Jizhou, commander of the 4th Route of the Northeastern Volunteer Army, Li Fangting, commander of the 17th Route, Xiao Hanchen, commander of the 29th Route, Sun Yutian, commander of the 33rd Route, and Liu Chunqi, commander of the 34th Route, previously sent representatives Zhang Xingwu and Dong Yunlong south to seek assistance. They arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. According to them, the five routes of the Volunteer Army have a total of 23,000 soldiers who have been fighting fiercely against the Japanese invaders in the areas of Linyu, Suizhong, Xingcheng, Lingnan, Jinxi, and Chaoyang. However, they are in dire straits due to exhaustion of ammunition and food. They are appealing to the patriotic people to provide assistance and hoping that the government will send troops outside the customs as soon as possible to recover the lost territories and save the 30 million people in Northeast China.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Academic Circles Work Hard <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Donate to the Northeastern Volunteer Army</p>
<p>▲ Chaozhou Association donates 1,000 yuan</p>
<p>The Northeastern Volunteer Army Relief Association received notices yesterday from various collection points for donations, stating that students in primary and secondary schools are donating very enthusiastically. Details are listed as follows: Shanghai Zhejiang Industrial Bank received 2 yuan in silver dollars donated by Xu Yuanmin, receipt number Yu 18; Shishi Xinbao Newspaper Office received 8.3 yuan in silver dollars donated by the Twelve Fort Yangzi Primary School Municipal Government Propaganda Department, receipt number Zui 24; Tonghui Elementary School Grade 5 students' cost-saving association, Yang Anbang, Hu Shaoxiang, and others donated 4.58 yuan in silver dollars, receipt number Zui 25; Yao Heqing donated 30 yuan in silver dollars, receipt number Zui 26; Yan Kaidi donated 40 yuan in silver dollars, receipt number Zui 27; Ningbo Siming Middle School Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association donated 515.6 yuan in silver dollars for the second time, receipt number Zui 28.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the association received a letter yesterday from the Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Association, stating in brief that the Northeast has fallen for nine months, the government has made empty promises of resistance and watched idly as it was devastated. The Northeastern Volunteer Army could not bear to see their compatriots subjected to the enemy's cruelty and could only resist with flesh and blood, pressing forward one after another, regarding death as returning home. Reports say that Representative Gu Weijun said during his return to Beiping that the people outside the customs only ask when the government will recover the Northeast. How tragic this statement is! If one has no heart, how can one bear to not save them? Since the people in all parts of our country cannot share the dangers of fire and water with the Northeastern Volunteer Army, if they do not provide economic assistance, how much different would that be from watching without saving? Moreover, given the ambitions of the Japanese bandits, if the Northeast is lost, other provinces will inevitably be threatened. If we treat them like the people of Qin treated the people of Yue, we will all perish in the end. Your association spares no effort to promote donations, running around and appealing, which is deeply admirable. Our association has now raised 1,000 yuan in silver dollars from anonymous donors and is sending it along with this letter. Please remit it to the Northeast immediately to provide relief. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it serves as a whole fur coat to protect one armpit. Although the Northeast is only a corner, it cannot resist the violent Japanese invaders throughout the country. However, if the national lifeline can be extended, wouldn't the 400 million Chinese people have heroes rise up to lead the people to recover the lost land? As long as there is a breath of life left, we can only do our best and continue to raise more funds for future shipments. All 1,000 yuan of donations have been directly delivered to the Bank of China, and an official receipt has been obtained. Recently, the amount of donations from all sectors for the Northeastern Volunteer Army has surged. The Relief Association is now following the procedures stipulated in its regulations to petition the Custody Committee to immediately remit the funds to the Northeast to provide relief to the Volunteer Army.</p>

<p>The Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Association telegraphed Chen Jitang and Chen Ce, stating: Commanders Chen of the First Army Group in Guangzhou, Commanders Chen of the Qiongzhou Navy, learned that there is a risk of war in Guangdong due to the issue of command over the navy and air force. At this time of national crisis, we should be united against foreign enemies, how can we engage in internal strife and invite national disaster? We urge you to immediately cease war preparations and jointly save the nation from danger. In dire distress, we await your orders. Respectfully, Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Association, Xiao.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Problem of Reducing or Waiving Rent <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>▲ The municipal government consulted yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Meeting again on the 25th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government convened a discussion meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, gathering representatives from both landlords and tenants involved in the rent reduction and waiver movement to seek solutions. Those present included Yu Hongjun from the Shanghai Municipal Government, Sun Yongyi from the Social Affairs Bureau, landlord representatives Pan Xulun, Wu Baodi from the Nanshi landlords, Shen Lianfang from the Zhabei landlords, representatives of the Rent Reduction and Waiver Movement Committee Yu Hualong, Zhang Henghai, Zhang Yichen, Wang Hanliang, Li Yongxiang, and Zhang Xiaolin and Gui Yanfang from the Shanghai Local Association, Luo Qinghua from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, etc. The meeting was chaired by Yu Hongjun, who first delivered an opening speech, followed by Pan</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Xulun explaining that the owners also sympathize with the reduction or waiver of rent, but according to the General Principles of Civil Law, rent waivers are permissible when the premises are not occupied, but requests for rent waivers for occupied premises are inappropriate, and so on. Subsequently, Yu Hualong, Gui Yanfang, Shen Lianfang, and others spoke one after another to debate. Yu Hongjun then spoke, stating that he was pleased that the meeting had reached a consensus on the principle of rent waiver. Finally, it was decided to submit the seven measures proposed by the Rent Reduction and Waiver Association to the landlord representatives to formulate their opinions and submit a written statement to the municipal government for review. It was also decided to convene another meeting of both parties on the 25th of this month (Saturday). The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>The seven rent reduction and waiver measures proposed by the tenant representatives in Shanghai's district are appended below: (1) Rent for February, March, and April of this year in the areas north of the Suzhou River and in Hongkou and Yangshupu shall be waived entirely. Starting in May, further decisions will be made depending on the local situation. (2) Rent for February and March of this year in Nanshi, Pudong, and the extraterritorial road areas in western Shanghai shall be waived entirely. Starting in April, rent shall be paid at 40% of the original rent until the local situation returns to normal. (3) Rent for February and March of this year in the entire area south of the Suzhou River and in the French Concession shall be waived entirely. Starting in April, rent shall be paid at 50% of the original rent until the situation returns to normal. (4) Rent shall be waived entirely in the areas of Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, Zhenru, and other areas, as well as areas north of the Iron Gate in the Public Concession or adjacent areas, until the situation returns to normal. (5) Except in districts (1) and (4), tenants shall pay for public electricity and tap water during the rent waiver period, and sub-landlords may collect these fees from sub-tenants on a pro rata basis. (6) Tenants in all districts shall enjoy the same rent reduction and waiver rights during the reduction period. (7) During the rent reduction and waiver period, neither landlords against tenants nor sub-landlords against sub-tenants may use excuses to force eviction or increase rent.</p>
<h3 id="e158">A Glimpse into Foreigners' Psychology <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>▲ Disapprove of Establishing a Free City</p>
<p>▲ But Advocate Not Stationing Troops, Chinese or Foreign</p>
<p>▲ In short, it harms Chinese sovereignty</p>
<p>The Mainland News reported that yesterday, an official from the Public Works Department told the Mainland News reporter that the rumored Shanghai Free City plan is an unfeasible plan, directly violating the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Chinese government will ultimately not agree. If the great powers force China to implement it, it will infringe upon Chinese sovereignty. Therefore, although there has long been talk of a free city plan, it initially originated in 1862, and all countries have consistently rejected it. Even if the embers are rekindled this time, they will still be rejected by the great powers. He believes that a better plan that is easier to implement is to designate the area around Shanghai as a non-military zone, with a radius of approximately 20 or 30 miles from Shanghai, where neither Chinese nor foreign troops may be stationed. He believes that all countries concerned would benefit from this plan. Just as the Japanese army used the Public Concession as a base to attack the Chinese army, if the British and Americans wanted to use force to prevent the Japanese from taking this action, they would inevitably have to go to war with Japan. If Shanghai and its vicinity become a non-military zone, the Concession can be guaranteed as a neutral zone, and the recent hostilities would not have occurred. He believes that if the relevant powers sign a treaty with China to make Shanghai a neutral zone, many outstanding issues could be resolved. The reporter asked what the great powers would do if Japan or another country were to violate the neutrality. The official replied that the signatory countries could take joint action to force that country to respect Shanghai's neutrality. In short, Shanghai cannot be transformed into a free city without China's full consent, and he does not believe that China can agree to this. (Translator's Note: Although it is not explicitly stated, whether this official's words can represent the Public Works Department, it can indeed be said to represent the views of most important foreigners in Shanghai. But think about it, what impact would it have on China's sovereignty if Shanghai were to become a treaty-agreed non-military neutral zone? Would it not become a situation of "sacrificing to the gods, I am only nominally the master, but practically dead"? If I have a house and the neighbors agree, "You don't need to send people to guard this house, we neighbors will jointly guarantee its neutrality," then who would practically own this house? No need for wise men to debate it. If Shanghai were to become an agreed-upon non-military zone, wouldn't it be similar to this house? Then the Westerner's proposal is only one step away from a free city. Among the residents of Shanghai, there may be those who are concerned with their own interests, blinded by short-term gains, and secretly sympathize with the no-stationing-troops proposal. If they use the analogy of a house and give it some thought, they will surely realize that it is impossible.)</p>
<h3 id="e159">Post-War Reconstruction Funds for the Shanghai-Songhu Battle Zone <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>▲ The funds were borrowed from the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank for 300,000 yuan</p>
<p>▲ 150,000 yuan has already been allocated to both the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Regarding the post-war reconstruction and relief efforts in the Shanghai-Songhu Battle Zone, the central government has organized the Shanghai-Songhu Battle Zone Reconstruction Committee to take charge of everything. A reporter from the China Eastern News Agency visited Mr. Zhang Shouyong, a standing committee member of the committee, yesterday to inquire about the recent progress of the committee. According to Mr. Zhang, the relief funds were decided to be 1.1 million yuan at the second meeting. The method of bearing the funds has now been decided: the central government will bear 500,000 yuan, the local associations in the city will bear 300,000 yuan, the Shanghai Municipal Government will bear 150,000 yuan, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government will bear 150,000 yuan. Currently, the committee believes that relief efforts are urgent and cannot be delayed, so it has requested the central government to allocate relief funds as soon as possible. The central government then ordered the Ministry of Finance to negotiate with the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank for the first batch of loans of 300,000 yuan. This loan has no guarantees or interest, and the Ministry of Finance will repay 100,000 yuan from the national treasury each month. The three banks have now handed over the funds to the committee, which has decided on a distribution method: 150,000 yuan to the Shanghai Municipal Government and 150,000 yuan to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, to handle relief efforts separately. The scope of relief currently starts with emergency relief, such as assisting the reconstruction of the battle zone for the masses, providing economic relief to small businesses, and compensating farmers' planting, etc., all of which are handled by the respective provincial and municipal governments. In addition, 20,000 yuan has been advanced by the committee for epidemic prevention, which will be handled by the epidemic prevention team. The remaining 800,000 yuan of relief funds can be collected at any time, so that they can actively engage in disaster relief work. However, 1.1 million yuan is really a drop in the bucket for the battle zone, so the committee must continue to find ways to raise funds.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Be Careful of Munitions in the Battle Zone <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>▲ Report to the police on duty immediately if discovered</p>
<p>▲ Carefully excavate and remove them</p>
<p>Shanghai Public Security Bureau Proclamation Zheng No. 17: Proclamation regarding the discovery that since the Shanghai Incident occurred, there are munitions left behind in all battle zones. Civilians who accidentally touch them may die or be disabled. The director of this bureau has repeatedly received reports from various districts that there have been multiple cases of accidental contact resulting in death or injury, which is very sad. Therefore, we sincerely proclaim that all citizens should inform their sons and brothers that from now on, whenever and wherever dangerous goods are discovered, they should immediately report them to the police on duty, who will forward the report to the various districts for careful excavation and removal. Do not lightly pick them up, carry them, or throw them away arbitrarily, so as not to cause great misfortune and regret. This proclamation is important. June 18, 21st year of the Republic of China, Director Wen Yingxing.</p>
<h3 id="e162">April's <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Imports Increased Sharply</p>
<p>According to a report by the China International Trade Association, the value of foreign goods imported in April was 110,313,287 customs taels, and the value of exported goods was only 49,682,988 customs taels, resulting in a trade deficit of 60,630,299 taels. In January and February of this year, Japanese imports were less than 9 million taels. In March, they increased to more than 13 million taels. In April, they increased again to more than 20 million taels. From January to April, Japanese imports accounted for more than 13%, still occupying an important position among imported goods. In addition, the total value of imports from January to April this year was 370,571,964 customs taels, and the total value of exports was 190,819,873 customs taels, resulting in a total trade deficit of 179,752,091 taels. It was found that Japanese imports decreased during the Shanghai Incident in January and February, but they are expected to gradually increase in the future, and the total value of imports in the 21st year of the Republic of China will inevitably present an unprecedented record.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Changes in Haizhou Port <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>▲ Abandoning Dapu and rushing to build Xugou</p>
<p>Haizhou is the focal point of the Longhai Railway. In recent years, since the opening of the Haizhou liner service in Shanghai, goods from the Northwest that used to be transported to the Southeast via Hankou, Xuzhou, and Nanjing are now transported via Haizhou. Dapu is the main port for transportation in Haizhou. However, the port has been changing, and Dapu's draft has recently become unusually shallow, and merchant ships often encounter accidents, which hinders the transportation of goods. In order to develop its business and facilitate transportation, the Railway Bureau has opened a new port in the northeast. Both the station and the wharf will be built and ready in two months. The details of this matter are investigated and reported as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Flourishing Shipping in Haizhou Since the opening of the port in Haizhou, goods on the Longhai Railway can be transshipped to Shanghai through that port. Dapu is the point of contact for the carriages. There are two shipping companies in Shanghai that have special joint transportation agreements with the Longhai Railway, China Merchants and Dazhen, which jointly dispatch the Tonghua, Yongping, and Yong'an liners. The Hezhong Company also dispatches the Xuzhou and Zhengzhou liners to travel between Shanghai and Haizhou. This route was also suspended during the Shanghai War, but it has now returned to normal. The main imports are miscellaneous grains, oil soybeans, and water tobacco, and the main exports are foreign groceries, sugar, cloth, and paper cigarettes.</p>
<p>▲ Difficult Navigation in Dapu Dapu is Haizhou's only port. Shanghai is about 410 nautical miles away. The Longhai Railway has specially built a railway to transport goods, and the wharves for each liner are also located in that port to facilitate loading and unloading. However, the water level fluctuates. During the shallowest part of the summer, it is only four or five feet, so merchant ships often run aground and accidents occur. Even during high tide, it is only possible to load 500 or 600 tons of cargo, and it is difficult to travel with more. Therefore, the shipping industry feels deeply inconvenienced.</p>
<p>▲ Building a New Port in Xugou The Longhai Railway Bureau, realizing that Dapu cannot develop its business, decided to open a new port to facilitate transportation. After surveying and verification, there is a bay leading to the sea about 45 nautical miles northeast of Dapu. The place name is Xugou, and the draft is very deep, making it most suitable for sea liners to stop. Vessels weighing four or five thousand tons can also enter and exit freely. In the past, the Railway Bureau had the intention of opening Xugou as a commercial port and invited German engineers to estimate that it would cost 20 million yuan to build the port, so the matter was stopped. Now, it has decided to build a railway in Xugou, add warehouses, and deepen the seaport for liners to anchor. Various projects are being rushed to completion.</p>
<p>▲ Can Be Realized in Autumn After the new port in Xugou is built, the Railway Bureau will dismantle the railway in Dapu. The liner wharves will also be moved to the new port, and the port of Dapu will be completely abandoned. The station, tracks, and warehouses will be completed soon, and the Ministry of Finance is also building a customs house there to collect customs duties on imports and exports. It is expected that the entire project will be completed in August of this year. However, due to the fact that the seawall has not yet been built at the liner wharf, it will only be possible to anchor on the surface of the port at that time, and cargo will be loaded and unloaded by barges. After February, the new port in Haizhou can be realized and completed.</p>

<p>Commendations for Two Companies</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company</p>
<p>▲ Zhabei Commercial Water and Electricity Company</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident in Zhabei, the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company, under the leadership of Manager Zhu Kaichou, Deputy Manager Hong Jingping, Wu Zhongyi of the Vehicle Department, and station chiefs such as Bu Tingwu, immediately convened an emergency meeting. They decided to maintain transportation at all costs. Therefore, before the withdrawal of our 19th Route Army, the company transported troops and equipment, disregarding everything and making significant sacrifices. The Zhabei Commercial Water and Electricity Company also worked hard to supply water and electricity, providing substantial support to the national army. Consequently, both companies received commendations from the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday. The order stated: "To inform, the bureau previously reported the efforts of the company and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company during and after the war to the municipal government. Now, Directive No. 1405 has been received, stating, 'Having read the report, the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, amidst danger, disregarded everything, sacrificed, and worked hard, providing substantial support to the national army. Afterwards, they promptly restored services to meet the needs of the people, demonstrating outstanding achievements worthy of high commendation. The bureau is instructed to issue a commendation order, which should be followed.' Besides issuing separate orders, this order is for notification."</p>

<p>▲ To be sent to the Diplomatic Corps</p>
<p>▲ Not to the National Government</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that, according to a subsequent report from the Japanese semi-official news agency, the claim made last night that the Shanghai Consular Body would soon send a resolution from foreign chambers of commerce urging the convening of a round-table conference to the Nanjing National Government was a misunderstanding. It will be sent to the Diplomatic Corps instead. The resolution is currently under consideration by the Consular Body.</p>

<p>Oppose the Opium Monopoly</p>
<p>▲ Anti-Narcotics Association The Chinese National Anti-Narcotics Association held a meeting of its Standing Committee yesterday at the Navy YMCA on Sichuan Road. Attendees included Wang Jingqi, Li Denghui, Ding Shujing, Cai Rudong, Shen Gao, Chen Lingyun, Huang Jiawei, Wu Xiaofen, and others. The meeting proceeded as scheduled. First, Huang Jiawei reported on the association's affairs and the opposition to the opium monopoly over the past month. Then, the meeting discussed plans for future activities: (1) It was resolved to continue to oppose the government's rumored plan to implement an opium monopoly to the end. It was also proposed that, given the government's economic difficulties, alternative tax revenue measures should be proposed to offset the income from the monopoly. Based on a suggestion from Committee Member Li Denghui, this proposal would be submitted to each executive committee member to solicit opinions before being presented to the government. (2) The 22 articles of anti-smoking advocacy drafted by the association's secretariat were approved, and the association would seek input from other anti-narcotics organizations before submitting them to the government. (3) The National Anti-Narcotics Representatives Conference was decided to be held on August 29, the anniversary of the Treaty of Nanjing, in Hangzhou. All national anti-narcotics organizations would be notified to send representatives to participate. All preparatory matters would be handled by the secretariat in conjunction with the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Narcotics Association. (4) It was resolved that the association's monthly publication, the "Anti-Narcotics Monthly," would be expanded in scope and refreshed in content starting with the July issue (No. 56), transforming it into a general magazine. A contest would be held to solicit a new name. The meeting adjourned after these discussions.</p>
<p>▲ Academic Circles The Shanghai University Students' National Salvation Association, in protest against the opium monopoly, sent a letter to the Central Anti-Smoking Committee, clearly stating their anti-smoking stance. The original letter is recorded below: "To the esteemed Central Anti-Smoking Committee: Since the implementation of the opium monopoly during the seventh year of the Republic, public resentment has been boiling, and we are shamed before the world. Laws are disregarded, and public opinion is rising. The National Government, examining the advantages and disadvantages and heeding public sentiment, established your esteemed committee. At that time, a national anti-smoking conference was convened, and an anti-smoking plan was formulated. The opium demon was terrified, and local dealers were chilled. This was indeed a glorious moment. We believed that from then on, China's anti-smoking efforts would move from darkness to light. All yearned for this, and the entire population shared the same hope. However, in the three years since, we have not heard of any significant achievements. The rampant opium scourge in various regions remains the same as before, or even worse. In recent years, the government appointed Li, who has long promoted the evil theory of opium monopoly, and Wu Liande, known as the "Opium Monopoly Doctor," as anti-smoking commissioners, without stern rejection. Fragrant and foul are placed in the same container, and black and white are indistinguishable, leading to the withdrawal of righteous individuals and attracting the covetous eyes of those who profit from poison, who are constantly thinking about the opium monopoly. The management of narcotics and anesthesia has already deviated significantly from the original intention. What is the point of the state setting up this superfluous agency? Why should the people have one more enemy in the form of a monopoly? It is observed that twelve provinces, including Ji and Sui, have successively implemented disguised monopolies. Your esteemed committee, as the central anti-smoking headquarters, has not issued any punishments. Instead, you have lobbied for support, deliberately imitating the provinces to compete for profits. The central government has lost its dignity and its legal authority. The blame still lies with the central government. We recall that when Zhejiang Province was about to implement a monopoly, the provincial government resigned en masse in protest, and the plan did not proceed. This year, Fujian Province is implementing a monopoly, and the entire provincial committee has requested to be dismissed. Although the goal of banning opium has not been achieved, they can at least hope to be blameless. If names are not correct, words are not smooth; if words are not smooth, things cannot be accomplished. The repeated failures of the opium monopoly are due to this. If your esteemed committee still has sincere intentions to ban opium, please quickly rectify your hearts, abandon the fantasies of recent years, and strive to start anew with the people. When the central authorities are wavering on the issue of opium prohibition, a word of correction from your esteemed committee may bring some stability. If you wish to express your intentions, the precedents of Zhejiang and Fujian may be followed. Otherwise, as we have already said, why should the people have one more enemy in the form of a monopoly? Public opinion will impose its own sanctions. At this critical juncture, we urge all of you in your esteemed committee to reflect on yourselves, make a decisive choice, and lead the new capital. We will quietly observe the results. Written in haste, we have not fully expressed our thoughts. Respectfully addressed to the Central Anti-Smoking Committee. Sincerely, Shanghai University Students' National Salvation Association."</p>
<p>▲ Business Circles The Shanghai Niuzhuang, Zhifu, and Xiamen Three-Route Business Federation yesterday sent a telegram opposing the opium monopoly. The telegram reads: "To the Chinese National Anti-Narcotics Association and all national organizations: The tide of the opium monopoly has been surging for a long time. Recently, the government has decided to try a final measure and implement a monopoly, engaging in a life-and-death battle with the people. The news has arrived, and we want to cry but have no tears. The harm of the opium monopoly is known to everyone. Now the government is abandoning the path of light and choosing the path of certain death. It is evident that the country and the nation will be completely lost, and the tragedy of destruction is imminent. We earnestly request that your esteemed association strive to fight, adhere to a thorough and uncompromising spirit, and fight the evil forces to the end. Our federation is willing to lead all merchants and citizens as a rearguard. Shanghai Niuzhuang, Zhifu, and Xiamen Three-Route Business Federation kowtow. (Signed)"</p>

<p>Both Sides Still Insist Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Emergency Meeting Held, Three Declarations Issued</p>
<p>▲ Strike Committee and Foremen United</p>
<p>The labor strike at the Concession Telephone Company has become serious since negotiations broke down. The police have taken special precautions. The strike committee held an emergency meeting to decide on next steps and consulted with foremen on ways to unite. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Management's Hard Line Yesterday, the main office on Jiangxi Road and all branches and warehouses were heavily guarded by the police for protection. The company's attitude remained tough, insisting on unconditional resumption of work. The cable workers at the new Central Line shed on Fujian Road who were misled into resuming work immediately withdrew and insisted on continuing the strike. The strike committee's liaison office at the Avenue Edward VII Tongshang Hotel has been closed and moved to No. 79 Jiangsu Hotel on Wuma Road.</p>
<p>▲ Emergency Meeting The strike committee's presidium held an emergency meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. All strike committee members and the presidium chairman were present. The meeting resolved to: (1) Expand the strike committee's presidium to strengthen the strike organization; (2) Issue a third declaration; (3) Warn foremen who violate strike discipline; (4) Find ways to internally unite and prepare to face the outside world as one; (5) Decide on the next steps; (6) Establish committees for each trade and set up offices; (7) The strike committee members must report the resolutions to the workers.</p>
<p>▲ Consultation on Unity After the strike committee members Weng Zhenhua, Chen Zerong, and Pan Dingquan were removed from their war affairs duties by all the representatives and the strike committee was reorganized, internal disputes arose. Furthermore, the foreman Tang Liangzhi, Sun Guang, and others negotiated with the company privately and clashed with the strike committee, which significantly affected the future of the strike. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the strike committee, at the request of the workers, consulted with the foremen at the Far East Hotel on ways to unite. It is reported that all parties reached a mutual understanding and will unite from today onwards to prepare for the outside world.</p>

<p>Consultation on Water Supply Issues</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday to consult on water supply issues. The original letter reads: "To the esteemed Public Works Department: We have received your letter No. 1408 dated June 10th and the blank contract. The Association is still researching the water price calculated by meter, with a minimum price of 62.5 cents per thousand gallons, and has not yet expressed a specific opinion. However, we dare not speculate that the Shanghai Waterworks Company's failure to specify the distinction between 5,000, 3,000, and 2,000 gallons in the blank contract is for the convenience of manipulation, but Mr. He Lihua's protest is indeed due to this. Furthermore, although items two, three, and four are not related to the meter system, in the Association's view, they should also be included in the blank contract of the Waterworks Company, so that users have the opportunity to choose between the meter system and the fixed rate system. We believe that this approach would reduce a lot of trouble for the Department, the Association, the Company, and the users. We are sending this letter accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and handle it."</p>
<h3 id="e169">Recent News on the Extra-Settlement Roads Case <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Public Works Department Did Not Discuss It</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that, according to a statement by Feixin Dun, Director-General of the Public Works Department, the issue of extra-settlement roads was not discussed at the Public Works Department's board meeting on Wednesday. There is currently no change to the issue. It is reported that the Public Works Department and the Shanghai Municipal Government's Special Committee had previously discussed the matter and reached a settlement agreement, stipulating that the roads would be governed by the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Public Security Bureau would send police to guard them, but foreign supervisors would be hired. This agreement has not yet been formally submitted to Consul-General Cunningham. It is said that it will be submitted after the Public Works Department and the Shanghai Municipal Government approve it. After submission, it will be submitted to the Consular Body, the Diplomatic Corps, and the National Government for approval. Currently, the concession police and the Public Security Bureau police are providing services as usual on the extra-settlement roads. The concession police patrol the North Sichuan Road area, while the Chinese police stand guard at the entrances to the side streets leading to North Sichuan Road. Since the Chinese police took up their posts, most of the Chinese shops from Bazilu, North Sichuan Road to a certain point outside Shigaota Road have reopened, but they close early. At night, there are hardly any pedestrians on the streets outside Qiujiang Road.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Murder Case of an American Woman <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>▲ Chatting and Laughing in the Car, Shooting Down Below</p>
<p>▲ Abandoning the Body in a Creek, Leaving Calmly</p>
<p>▲ The Driver Was Terrified</p>
<p>▲ The Murderer is the Tianjin Bank Manager</p>
<p>Near Lincoln Road and Warren Road in western Shanghai, a Western assassination case occurred at around 11 AM yesterday. Both the victim and the assailant were Americans. Under the pretext of hiring a car, they went together westward. When they reached the intersection of Lincoln Road, the assailant ordered the driver to stop the engine. Then he and the victim got out of the car one after another, pretending to talk. The assailant pulled out a pistol from his pocket and fired two shots at the victim. One shot hit the victim's right waist, and the other hit the victim's head. Both shots hit vital points, causing instant death. Afterwards, the body was carried back to the car, and the driver was ordered to continue driving. After about three minutes, the body was thrown into the creek there. The murderer then fled north without a trace. The circumstances are bizarre. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Two Westerners Hire a Truck At around 11:10 AM yesterday morning, two well-dressed Westerners suddenly came to the United Automobile Company on Rue Mère Marie-Thérèse in the French Concession, claiming that they wanted to rent a truck to transport boxes and luggage to the Avenue Haig. At that time, the company did not have a truck, but for the sake of good service, they used the telephone to borrow a truck from the nearby Tanle Company for trial use. The number was noted as 56, and it was driven by Zhao Zhiliang, a Ningbo driver.</p>
<p>▲ Shooting the Companion After Getting Out of the Car However, after the car arrived, the two Westerners jumped into the car, sat side by side, and chatted and laughed. Zhao was ordered to start the engine and drive west. They drove along Route Robert and Avenue Haig to the intersection of Lincoln Road and Warren Road. One of the Westerners ordered Zhao to stop the car. The two got out of the car one after another, pretending to talk as they walked eastward. One of them then pulled out a pistol from his pocket and fired two shots at the victim. One shot hit the victim's waist, and the other hit the victim's head. Both shots hit vital points, causing instant death. Blood was all over the ground. At that time, the driver Zhao Zhiming, witnessing the scene, was stunned and terrified in the car.</p>
<p>▲ Throwing the Body into the Creek Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the murderer carried the body out of the car and ordered the driver to continue driving for about a mile. Then he ordered the driver to stop. The murderer jumped out of the car and threw the body into the creek there. He told the driver, "Don't be afraid. I'll take responsibility if anything happens." After saying this, the murderer walked away to the north.</p>
<p>▲ Detectives Went to Investigate Not long after, the driver Zhao Zhiliang, having recovered slightly from his shock, drove back at full speed and reported the situation to the foreman. The foreman immediately notified the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station by telephone. The police then sent detectives to investigate. It was verified that the deceased was wearing a light gray suit, was in his thirties, and had two gunshot wounds. The victim's yellow felt hat was taken back to the police station by the detectives for safekeeping. The body was sent to the morgue to await examination.</p>
<p>▲ The US Consulate is Investigating the Murderer According to investigations by reporters, the deceased was named R.K. Heim, and the murderer was his friend named T.M. Hansen. They were very good friends during their lifetime. Because they were unemployed in Shanghai, they were going to return to the United States together by ship. The cause of the murder has not yet been determined. The police station and the US Consulate are urgently arresting the murderer for punishment. It is reported that the murderer T.M. Hansen is the acting manager of Citibank in Tianjin. He had been in Shanghai for less than three days and lived in the Duchen Hotel on Simalu. The murdered R.K. Heim lived in the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road and had previously worked in the same bank.</p>

<p>▲ Free Injections to Prevent Cholera</p>
<p>At the Board of Directors meeting of the Public Works Department on the 15th of this month, the Director of the Health Department reported that the number of cholera cases had increased, but not as quickly as in previous epidemic years. This is the first time since 1902 that cholera has been discovered in May. It is impossible to know how extensive it will be this year, but fortunately, the rate of increase is not as dramatic as in 1902. Regarding the cleanliness of Zhabei, the Director stated that he had personally investigated it recently and that the situation was generally satisfactory. The first district has now been taken over by the Chinese authorities. There is some accumulation of garbage in this area, perhaps due to unavoidable oversights during the transition period. The second district is still being cleaned by the Public Works Department, and the situation is satisfactory. The Health Department is now increasing its equipment for free cholera injections. In addition to the injection car patrolling the concession, injections are given daily from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM (except Saturdays and Sundays) at the following five health sub-offices: (Central District) 23 Hankou Road; (North District) 100 Qipu Road; (East District) 67 Huade Road; 10 Tongzhou Road; (West District) 28 Maigen Road. All Chinese and poor Westerners can go there.</p>

<p>▲ Telegrams of Congratulations from Postal Workers Across the Country</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Association and the Labor Union previously suggested a plan to consolidate the postal foundation to the Ministry of Communications. After the administrative council meeting deliberated and resolved, the Postal Economic System Research Committee was organized. Wu Tiecheng, Chen Gongbo, Lin Shi, Huang Naiquan, Yang Jianping, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Shi Liangcai, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Gongquan, Du Yong, and Pan Gongzhan were appointed as members, and Wu Tiecheng was designated as the chairman. Wu has now drafted the outline of the committee's organization and has scheduled the first discussion meeting at the municipal government at 10:00 AM today. The committee will be formally established. However, the discussion of the postal system is closely related to all employees of the bureau, so the labor union has been asked to send representatives to attend. The labor union has decided to send standing committee members Shi Yitang, Kang Yong, Ge Fei, and Lao Jieming to attend.</p>
<p>Telegrams of congratulation from postal workers' unions across the country: "To Chairman Wu Tiecheng and all members of the Postal Economic System Research Committee: We have learned that the Executive Yuan has established the Postal Economic System Research Committee in accordance with Article 2 of the solution plan, and has appointed twelve gentlemen as members, with Mr. Wu Tiecheng as chairman. We are extremely pleased. We have always admired your leadership and your role as pillars of the party and the country. This time, you have been appointed as committee members, and you will urge the implementation of the plan to consolidate the postal foundation that we have proposed. We will see that after the establishment of the committee, the postal system will return to completeness and the postal economy will become more stable. Not only will all postal workers in the country never forget your virtue, but your names will also be immortalized with China Post. We send this telegram of congratulations and wish you success. The National Postal Workers' Union, together with the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Nanjing Postal Workers' Union, Suzhou Postal Workers' Union, Zhenjiang Postal Workers' Union, Wuxi Postal Workers' Union, Changzhou Postal Workers' Union, and more than forty other postal workers' unions kowtow."</p>

<p>▲ Many People Came to See Him Off</p>
<p>Although Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu Aoi's right foot was disabled, his injury gradually healed. He boarded the Shanghai Maru and departed at 9:00 AM yesterday. At around 8:00 AM, Shigemitsu left the Fumin Hospital. Due to his difficulty in moving, he rode in a medical car to the Huishan Wharf to board the ship. Accompanying him were his wife, Doctors Hirata and Yoshimori, Adjutant Takeuchi, Secretary Asaga, and several female nurses. Japanese police chief Aiga provided care and protection along the way. At that time, there was a large crowd of Japanese people at the pier to see him off. Important figures from the Japanese political world, such as Consul General Murai, Commander Sakano, Commander of the Marine Corps Sugisaka, Okazaki, Horiuchi, and Arita, also went to see him off. On the Chinese side, Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi and Mayor Wu Tiecheng also sent representatives to see him off. The situation was quite lively. It is reported that after Shigemitsu returns to his country, he will take a long leave of absence to recuperate. Whether he will return to China is currently undecided.</p>
<p>After Ambassador Shigemitsu returned to his country, all embassy affairs continued as usual, and Councilor Yano of the Beiping Embassy was appointed to be responsible for acting as his agent.</p>

<p>▲ The Qingdao Airport Has Been Selected</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation, in view of the inconvenience of transportation between Shanghai and Tianjin, is planning to establish the Shanghai-Tianjin air route to facilitate travel and postal services. Since the start of preparations, progress has been unusually rapid. The airports in Haizhou and Tianjin have been completed, and the radio stations at each station are also ready. Only the Qingdao airport has not been selected, so it has not been possible to open the route for the time being. Liu Peiquan, the general manager of the company, in order to open the route as soon as possible, sent Wang Xichang, the director of the business group, to Qingdao on the 10th of this month to make preparations. The company received a telegram from the official in Qingdao yesterday stating, "The former Japanese-used airport in Cang kou is the most suitable. It is government-owned land, and the municipal government has agreed to allocate it for use. It is currently being planned." Another telegram stated, "The municipal government has sent people to select the airport. Local Chinese and foreign merchants and citizens all want to see it completed," etc. The opening of the route should not be far off.</p>

<p>The Taikoo Company's Shengjing steamer ran aground on Qingming Island. The company sent the Fengtian and Ningbo steamers to unload the cargo inside the ship and hired a Japanese salvage company's rescue ship to rescue it. Yesterday, the Shanghai office received a telegram stating that the ship had floated off the reef. It is now repairing the hole and pumping out the accumulated water, and the Ningbo steamer is towing it to Weihaiwei, and then it will be brought to Shanghai for major repairs.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Explanation of the Telephone Price Increase <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the telephone price increase event announced by the Public Works Department yesterday, the phrase "Due to the fall in the price of silver, the company's capital expenditures have increased by 14% compared to Mr. Anstie's original estimate" in the original text is misleading. The so-called 14% increase is the amount of the increase in gold expenditure. If converted to silver, the amount of the increase is actually 117%. Mr. Anstie's original estimate was 8 million taels of silver, which at 2 shillings and 6.5 pence was converted to 4,936,000 yuan in gold. However, the company actually spent 5,636,229 yuan in gold, which is 14% more than the original estimate. In fact, due to the fall in the price of silver, 5,636,229 yuan in gold is equivalent to 17,342,242 taels of silver, which is more than double the original estimate of 8 million taels. The company's proposal was to first make Mr. Anstie's expenses applicable after implementation, and then increase the price by 11%. In this way, the company could obtain interest of about 6.7%. However, the Public Works Department is now only allowing Mr. Anstie's expenses to be changed to an applicable number. As for the additional increase, the company must submit a detailed explanation to the Public Works Departments of the two concessions and request their approval before it can be allowed.</p>
<p>Mr. Anstie's report stated, "In view of the company's needs in the coming years and the unfavorable exchange rate when importing equipment, it is proposed to temporarily allow the company to increase the price of commercial telephones from 78 taels to 105 taels, residential telephones from 52 taels to 65 taels, and private telephone lines from 40 to 50 taels per section, and extension lines and extensions by 25%... This price increase will increase the company's income by about one-quarter... but it is only a satisfactory method at present. The permanent price should be determined as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Article 13 of the company's franchise contract states, "The price list at the time of the contract should apply until the full conversion to automatic equipment, but the shareholders' price reduction method is not included in this example. After the full conversion to automatic equipment, the price should be agreed upon by the company and the Public Works Department. The standard should allow the company to obtain annual interest of 8%, plus an additional 2%. If the conversion to automatic equipment cannot be completed within two years, the price may not be increased during the period of delay, which is twice the duration of the two years. The annual net profit should be the total annual income, less maintenance costs, management fees, depreciation, stock raising funds, bad debts, insurance, pensions, savings, taxes, interest, and other expenses. However, stock interest, dividends, and business expansion reserve funds are not included. The company's business investment should include the following four items: (A) the paid-up capital and the excess income from the company's sale of shares; (B) the income from the issuance of bonds; (C) loans and mortgage loans, etc., with a term of more than one year, but overdrafts and outstanding accounts payable, etc., of a temporary nature, are not included; (D) general reserve fund, which is calculated based on the amount of capital used throughout the year."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Egg Industry Association, because the Anhui Egg Tax Bureau, even after the Ministry of Finance ordered its abolition, still detained goods and forcibly levied taxes, becoming increasingly oppressive. Thereupon, on [date], it telegraphed the Ministry of Finance again, requesting severe sanctions. Now, it is learned that the Association has received a fast mail telegram from the Ministry of Finance, bearing the reference number Fu Zi 318, which reads: "To the Shanghai Egg Industry Association: Your telegram of [date] received. It is verified that the Ministry previously received a letter from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan stating, 'By order of the President of the Yuan, the special stable goods business tax in Anhui Province shall be immediately abolished,' etc. The Anhui Provincial Department of Finance was instructed to comply and the matter was placed on file. In response to your telegram's information, the Department has again instructed the said Department [of Finance] to swiftly comply with the original decision of the Executive Yuan, immediately abolish the tax, and release the detained goods.

<h3 id="e180">Dinghai Fishermen Petition in Hangzhou <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Daishan and Changtu Islands, under the jurisdiction of Dinghai County, are the most abundant fish-producing areas in our country. Even Sun Yat-sen's posthumous teachings in the National Reconstruction Strategy mentioned the idea of building a fishing port on Changtu Island to promote the long-term development of China's fishing industry. Therefore, in recent years, the National Government has spared no effort in reforming the administration of the fishing industry. In addition to abolishing the people-harming likin tax, it has also completely exempted fish taxes to demonstrate its dedication to revitalizing the fishing industry and benefiting the fishermen. Unexpectedly, while the government is striving for improvement and expansion, the two fish firms of Zha Pu Hongchang and Run Tai are taking advantage of the situation to monopolize, speculate, and exploit the fishermen, which is increasing day by day. This has aroused a serious backlash from all the fishermen on the two islands of the county, who are jointly seeking self-rescue. They have publicly elected Zhao Guohuang, Bao Zhenpin, and more than ten others to form a petition delegation responsible for representing the whole, and they have rushed to Nanjing and Hangzhou to present a petition to the Ministry of Industry and the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction, describing their oppressed situation and requesting relief. They are also asking for strict prohibition and suppression of the two firms' illegal acts of oppressing the fishermen. It is reported that the delegates passed through Shanghai yesterday on their way to Hangzhou. According to them, the fish firms have traditionally charged a commission of five per cent on the value of fish sold (i.e., five yuan commission for every hundred yuan), and another three per cent discount (i.e., three yuan commission for every hundred yuan). The combined commission and discount amount to eight yuan and fifty cents per hundred yuan, constituting a double commission exceeding one yuan. The fishermen believe that the discount is a form of fraud and express their dissatisfaction. However, due to the long-standing practice, they have had to endure it for the time being. Unexpectedly, the two firms have become even more unscrupulous and have added new abusive clauses. Since the spring of this year, they have jointly forced fishing boats to pass their accounts through Ningbo for fish sold in Zha Pu. If the fishermen take money on the spot in Zha Pu, they must charge three, four, five, or even six yuan per hundred yuan according to the current declared price in Ningbo, leaving it to the firms' consciences. This has turned into another double discount, with excessive amounts being deducted. Fishermen brave the dangers of wind and waves, risking their lives in the ocean to catch fish and support their families. After a year of hard work, the meager profits they earn are now being heavily exploited by the two firms, making it unbearable for the fishermen. Therefore, as a last resort, they have publicly elected representatives to go to Nanjing and Zhejiang to appeal and request strict prohibition of the firms' illegal activities, the recovery of overcharged amounts, and the relief of the suffering of the majority of fishermen. Fortunately, the Ministry of Industry has approved the case and instructed the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction to investigate and handle it in detail. Therefore, the delegates urgently need to petition in Hangzhou in order to achieve the goal of severely punishing the illegal acts of the two firms and recovering the overcharged funds, thus relieving the suffering of the majority of fishermen.</p>

<p>Last night at 7:00 PM, colleagues from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Ningbo Railways held a joint banquet for the Director of the Railway Bureau, Chen Xinghan, at the Great Eastern Restaurant. More than a thousand people attended. During the banquet, Zheng Baozhao, the chief of the traffic department of the two railways, delivered a welcoming speech, stating that the economic situation of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway had been extremely difficult since the January 28th Incident. Fortunately, Director Chen had planned and managed the situation, enabling the maintenance of railway operations and the livelihoods of the colleagues. Secondly, after the bridges on the Beijing-Shanghai line were severely damaged, they were able to resume traffic in a short period of time, demonstrating the organizational capabilities of the Chinese people. All of this was due to the guidance of Director Chen. All colleagues should work hard and diligently, and obey the guidance of Director Chen, to restore railway operations after the loss of millions of dollars in railway assets. Director Chen then delivered a speech, stating that he was deeply grateful for the grand banquet. During the difficult period of the January 28th Incident, he was able to restore the entire Beijing-Shanghai line with the help and efforts of everyone. The Shanghai-Wusong line will also be open to traffic next Monday. This is all thanks to everyone's efforts, and he hopes that everyone will continue to maintain this spirit, work together, and strive together. Afterwards, Zou Zhenjian, the representative of the two railway party branches, Chen Bohua, the representative of the labor union, Wang Shenshan, the representative of the mechanical department, and the representative of the engineering department delivered speeches. The banquet ended joyfully at 10:00 PM.</p>

Ji Jiannan, Wang Hanqiang, and Zhu Zhenhan were publicly elected as the presidium. After the meeting began with the usual formalities, the chairman delivered an opening speech. Next, the proposals were discussed. Since the Shanghai War, the losses suffered by industry and commerce have been enormous. As the Association is a combination of factories, the losses suffered by member factories this time should be presented to the government for appropriation of funds for relief. A resolution was passed to hand over the case to the new committee for handling. There were many other important cases, which cannot be recorded in detail. Finally, the executive and supervisory committee members were elected. Twenty-one companies, including Sanyou Industrial Society, Wuzhou Pharmaceutical, Kang Yuan Factory, and Shengde Factory, were elected as executive committee members for the sixth term. Zhufeng Enamel Factory, Wuhe Factory, and Lingsheng Ink Factory were elected as supervisory committee members. After the election, a meal was held and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Electrochemical Plant Bleaching Powder Hydrochloric Acid Cheap Price</p>
<p>Although the Northeast Volunteer Army is still fighting hard, the sound of gunfire in Shanghai has been silent for a long time. Military conquest is obviously effective. The influx of Japanese goods is inevitable. In order to regain the original market, they do not hesitate to reduce prices for sales. Most of the factories are determined to save the country and have always resisted. However, there are also some who occasionally purchase due to the cheap prices. The crisis in the industry has arrived. It is reported that the factory is not afraid of sacrifice and actively resists. From today onwards, all bleaching powder and hydrochloric acid will be calculated at a 10% discount on the original price for a period of one month. Even those who have already signed contracts can also do so.</p>

<p>Donggou Splint Factory Electricity</p>
<p>▲ Supplied by Pudong Electric Company</p>
<p>Great China Match Company has been quite developed in business recently. There is a splint factory in Donggou, Pudong, which is large in scale and well managed. It is the giant of the national self-run match splint factory, equipped with a 120-horsepower steam engine and generator. The electric lights and power required by the factory are all supplied by its own machine. Later, after calculating the cost of coal, wages, repairs, etc., the expenses were huge and uneconomical, and the management was complicated and inconvenient. The capacity was limited and could not be expanded arbitrarily. However, the Pudong Electric Company has abundant power, supplies it day and night, and charges are cheap, which is more cost-effective. Therefore, the factory has now stopped its own machine and completely switched to the electricity supply of Pudong Electric Company. It is said that the monthly power cost can be saved a lot.</p>

In 1928, he felt compassion for the exposed broken coffins and skeletons, numbering more than 100,000, in the Jiang-Zhe border area, which were a hindrance to hygiene. He made a great vow to undertake burial work, fulfilling his obligations. For four years, he has been doing his best, but he has been struggling with financial difficulties. Over the years, he has handled the burial of more than 59,060 bodies in various places. This year, he continues to carry out this work, but he is deeply sorry that his aspirations are grand but his strength is weak due to economic hardship. It is reported that the auspicious day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar is the 80th birthday of Wang Junsheng's mother, Mrs. Jiang. Wang Yiting, Dong Hanzhi, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaoyu, Gong Ziyu, Yuan Ludeng, Zhao Wenhuan, and Li Shoushan have initiated a joint discussion to raise funds for celebrations. Mr. Wang plans to use the gifts and ceremonies donated for the celebrations for the cost of burial. This will not only benefit relatives and friends, but also promote public hygiene and respect humanity in society. His enthusiasm and perseverance are commendable. It is hoped that all circles, in view of Mr. Wang's concern for the bones and his painstaking efforts, will be willing to support this righteous cause.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Robbery and Assault on Guohuo Road <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>▲ None of the Robbers Have Been Apprehended</p>
<p>▲ The Injured Person May Become Disabled</p>
<p>The bean sprout workshop opened by Pan Huayun, a Shaoxing native, at No. 28 Yunjili, behind the Shanghai-Minhang South Extension Long-Distance Bus Company on Guohuo Road in the South City, has a fairly good business, which is coveted by robbers. The night before last, Pan was attending a Guandi gathering and drinking alcohol. He took out all the cash and silver dollars at home to be used, so there was no cash in the house. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 PM, four robbers suddenly came, two wearing long black gowns and two wearing short blue cloth shirts and pants, each holding a handgun. When they arrived at Pan's house, only Pan's wife, Mrs. Pan Xu, and two infants were at home, already asleep. The robbers went forward and pushed the door open. The neighbor, Mrs. Zhu Wang, was holding a child and standing at the door. When the robbers saw her, they immediately watched her. Seeing that she had a pair of gold rings, they slapped her twice on the face and took the rings. They immediately went to Pan's house and forbade her from making any noise. Although they robbed the house, they only got a pair of silver bracelets, a silver lock piece, a cloud gauze shirt, a blue cloth shirt, a straw hat, and a felt hat. At that time, the child saw it and cried loudly, and the sound was heard outside. The robbers stopped and fled with what they had robbed. The two women also went out. Many Shaoxing natives lived nearby. After learning about it, they each grabbed shoulder poles and bamboo poles and chased after the robbers. When they arrived on Guohuo Road, the smoke and paper store sounded the alarm whistle, and the bandits fled east. Seeing the sound of the alarm and the pursuers behind them, they fired their guns randomly and ran to the South Mountain Lane entrance, which was more than twenty houses away. A coppersmith nicknamed "Little Pockmark" (a Shaoxing native) had just walked out of the lane. Seeing this situation, he did not know it was a robbery and ran to the road to watch. The robbers fired at him, and one bullet hit Little Pockmark's right leg, penetrated his left leg, and then entered his right leg again, getting stuck in the bone. Little Pockmark was injured in both feet and fell to the ground, unable to stand up. The robbers continued to fire their guns and fled east towards the Shanghai Military Camp. None of the robbers were caught. Therefore, the robbed person admitted that he was unlucky, and the injured person was taken to the Shanghai Hospital by his wife to be treated after reporting to the police station in the Second District, fearing that he would become disabled.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Appeal of the Hadong Tenants' Association <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>▲ Three Demands</p>
<p>The Hadong Tenants' Association in this city has raised three reasons to the landlord, including correcting the lunar calendar for rent collection, reducing wartime rent, and reducing rent in response to the market downturn. They have not been accepted. They have filed appeals to the city's party and government organs, commercial associations, city unions, and various groups, requesting them to uphold fairness. The original text reads: "[The members of the association, etc., have rented Hadong's houses for many years. On January 28th this year, the Japanese army invaded the city, and the market was closed for two months, causing extreme hardship. Therefore, they wrote to the owner, Madam Luo Jialing, asking her to voluntarily waive the wartime rent, reduce the rent rate in the future, and correct the bad habit of collecting rent according to the lunar calendar, so as to conform to the law and alleviate the difficulties of the merchants, preserve the vitality after the war, and look forward to the prosperity of society. Unexpectedly, two letters were sent, but no reply was received. The merchants were deeply disappointed. Unexpectedly, things did not end there. The Hadong Foreign Company not only ignored the requirements of the association, but also used its position and power to wantonly destroy. Recently, for example, the Lianli Huazhuangpin Company in Huajin Lane, due to the impact of the war, owed five months' rent. It repeatedly stated that it would pay three months first, but the rental office refused to accept it and instead fabricated reasons to provide a guarantee in the special district court, applying to put the company under temporary detention. Also, if the Xiangmao Silk Thread Company on Er Malu retained and deferred payment of the February and March rent according to the city's reduction principle, it unexpectedly angered the rental office, which again used the excuse of renovating the house and taking it back for its own use, and applied to the court for temporary enforcement. Also, if the Taikang Company was elected by the public as one of the executive committee members due to the establishment of the association, the rental office held a grudge in its heart. On the afternoon of the 15th, it led ten people to the company in the name of collecting rent, roaring and coercing. Such incidents are countless. The association's various demands to the owner this time are not unreasonable, but the owner did not examine them carefully and instead trampled on them, which made the association feel regret and pain. As a last resort, the association had to appeal to your bureau for fair assistance for various demands and reasons. (1) Correcting the lunar calendar for rent collection: Shanghai is a part of the territory of the Republic of China, and the national laws should be obeyed by all. Since the national government ordered the abolition of the lunar calendar, all merchants, whether Chinese or foreign, have long complied with the reform for rent, but Hadong still relies on its power and continues to collect rent according to the lunar calendar, violating government laws and exploiting the interests of tenants. One who should immediately correct the government order. (2) Reducing and exempting rent during the war period: Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, not only February and March were during the shutdown period, suffering great losses, but even April and May, although the market has nominally opened, the business situation is much worse than before. It is like a weak body after illness, and it is necessary to reduce its burden in order to recover it as soon as possible. The rent for February and March should be reduced and exempted. Two (3) Implementing automatic rent reduction: The rent of Hadong's houses is the highest in the city. Taking the market houses in the San Malu area as an example, due to the high rent, no one dares to ask. The market houses have been closed for more than a year and are all eyesores. The same location, the same form, used to rent for more than one hundred taels per house, but now it rents for only eighty taels or seventy-five taels per house. From this example, how much do old tenants lose compared to new tenants? The Hadong Foreign Company always raises the rent whenever the market is slightly prosperous, but never reduces the rent when the market declines. Considering the current market decline, the rent should be reduced. Three. In summary, the above three are all legitimate demands that cannot be delayed. I sincerely request your bureau to understand the difficulties of the merchants, take on the role of mediation, and also issue an official letter to the special district court, paying attention to the suffering of the merchants, and not approving applications for temporary enforcement and temporary detention. I am eagerly awaiting orders.]"</p>

<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>According to foreign sources yesterday, the Soviet Union is very cold towards the Sino-Russian resumption of diplomatic relations talks, which further shows that Japan and Russia have already exchanged opinions. Our side is not without lagging behind. If this situation continues, then the previous talks were unfortunately correct.</p>
<p>Although the authorities regard the issue of Sino-Russian resumption of diplomatic relations as important, we do not regard it as important. The authorities regard it as disappointing, but we do not regard it as disappointing. The fact that weak countries have no diplomacy is an iron rule like a mountain. Even if the Soviet Union and our country really resume diplomatic relations, it is difficult to predict what the effect will be, and there are many issues that should be considered after the resumption of diplomatic relations, and it is not certain that any benefits will be received.</p>

Now, without repairing the fence first, we are eagerly hoping for the鹬蚌之爭(snipe and clam fight) and reaping the fisherman's profits. It is really [like a fool waiting for the sky to fall, a poor man waiting for the people to rebel]. Its foolishness is unmatched. I look back and look at our country's politics, party affairs, military affairs, and industry. There is nothing that does not make people sigh and feel pessimistic.</p>

<p>After the disaster, I searched for the pavilions in order, and the old gardens and forests are still outside the world. In the rain, the light of the lamps sinks in thousands of halos, and the sound of cars accompanies a chant under the leaves. Sitting and feeling that the river flows without a fixed form, I temporarily collect my soul and merge with the layers of shade. I wait for the moon and peek at the stars, striving to sink and float together with the Divine Land.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Making Canned Food at Home <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Yu</p>
<p>There are countless microorganisms breeding in the air. Food such as fish and meat will rot if left for a long time due to their erosion. Therefore, to avoid this problem, it is necessary to use canning methods.</p>
<p>Storing things in cans is the canned food sold on the market. Because canned food is successfully manufactured using scientific methods, the air and all microorganisms in the can are eliminated completely. It can be preserved for a long time and will never spoil. However, although there are many canned food companies in Shanghai, the manufacturing methods rely entirely on machinery, which is not easily imitated in the home. Therefore, in order to travel outside and be convenient to carry, one can only buy products from various companies on the market. However, the various products of various companies are all the same, which is already a defect. Moreover, their products cannot have all the dishes that home-cooked dishes should have, which is even more difficult to satisfy the appetite of general gourmets. There is now a homemade method that has been proven through practice and the results are excellent. If readers can follow it, it will be easy to carry the dishes they like to eat every day. Even if traveling to foreign countries, the flavor of their hometown can still please my taste buds. Then, even when I am in a foreign land, it is no different from my hometown, so why not do it? Now, I will disclose it as follows, please try it.</p>
<p>After eating the canned food you bought, do not discard the cans. Wait until you have accumulated a lot, wash them one by one, and dry the water stains. If the can surface is broken, find another piece of tinplate and cut it to the appropriate size according to the diameter of the can. After you cook the things you like to eat, put them into the cans one by one, add the can surface, and seal it with tin. Then put the cans into the pot, add water to half of the can, and cook it over high heat for about half an hour to make the contents of the can boil and emit steam. Take the can out, and use a drill to drill a small hole in the can surface. Once the drill is pulled out, immediately use tin to plug the hole. At this point, the procedure is complete, and the canned food has been successfully made. Because the tinplate on the can surface is just drilled through, you can hear a sound. At the moment of this sound, all the air sealed in the can and the remaining microorganisms are squeezed out by the steam, leaving nothing. In this way, it can be kept permanently and has the same effect as mechanically made ones.</p>

<p>— Kai Tao</p>
<p>[Hey! Mr. Niu is here! Ha! Ha! Mr. Niu is here! ...]</p>
<p>Many students shouted arrogantly. It turned out that the class bell had already rung. On the top of Mr. Niu's [Chinese teacher's] hat, the students had already added a chopstick-like white paper strip. Moreover, he was wearing a pair of old glasses and an old bamboo cloth long gown, walking towards the classroom with sweat all over his face. Of course, how could the fashionable and nosy students not laugh?</p>
<p>Lu and Ma, students who were famous for being cunning, saw that the teacher had not yet approached, so they used their magical abilities and hurriedly put the blackboard-wiping cloth on the half-open classroom door, preparing to let the teacher taste it. Now, all the students in the hall were as silent as if they had taken a sedative tonic, sitting silently.</p>
<p>Mr. Niu had always walked in slowly, but today he was late because he had something to do, so he rushed forward, regardless of everything, and pushed the door open. Who knew that his apprentice's sky-falling prop had hit him down, scaring the old man out of his wits. He shouted, [Yo!], and the old glasses had already unfortunately been shattered into pieces. Mr. Niu then launched a punitive expedition.</p>
<p>[Which fool?] Mr. Niu said angrily.</p>
<p>The students were all silent. Mr. Niu went to report to the principal, but the chopstick strip was still waving on Mr. Niu's head as he thought secretly,</p>
<p>[Are my eyes okay! ...]</p>

<p>— Wu Jichen</p>
<p>[More people than positions] [It is difficult to find a job] These two sentences are the biggest obstacles in the lifeline. When unemployed people have no way to be recommended and wander around, they have to look for opportunities in the newspapers every day. Every day there are people asking for staff and seeking cooperation, but the result is still disappointing, because most of them require hundreds or even dozens of yuan in guarantee money in exchange for a job. Just imagine, how can poor unemployed people afford this ability to bear?</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Zhang is also one of the unemployed. One day he saw an advertisement in the × newspaper, which said:</p>
<p>Recruiting Male and Female Actors</p>
<p>Entrusted by major famous film companies, dozens of male and female actors are being recruited. Those who want to appear on the silver screen, regardless of age, only need to be literate. There is a price of 50 cents to 1 yuan per day. This is a rare opportunity, so register as soon as possible. No fees are charged for registration. Registration location: ×× Lane ×× Road ×× Number, Shanghai ×× Film Company</p>
<p>This kind of opportunity that does not require a guarantee or fees is indeed rare. Mr. Zhang enthusiastically joined. Who knew that the address of the so-called ×× Film Company was a stove shop in ×× Lane. The characters inside were very beautiful and dressed in Western clothes. Everything was arranged except for a broken desk and three or four wooden chairs, and a few star photos nailed on the wall with pictures. Nothing valuable could be found. Their advertisement clearly stated that no fees would be charged, but when joining, they had to pay a registration fee of 60 cents and a handling fee of 40 cents. Because the amount was still small, it was really difficult to find a job, and most of the people who registered did not argue with them. At that time, they paid up. On the third day, they really set off to ×× Company to participate in the filming of ××××. Every morning, a car from ×× Company came to pick them up and returned them at night. Food and lodging were all prepared by themselves. After about a dozen times of filming, the director of the company said that the filming of ×× Company's film was completed. Please go home and rest for two days, and he will calculate and pay the wages before filming again. So we happily went home and waited quietly for two days. When we went to ×× Film Company again, it was already empty!</p>

<p>— He Zhou</p>
<p>When Mrs. Zhang married her eldest son five years ago, she was very dissatisfied because the "dowry" brought by her daughter-in-law was very meager. For this reason, she spoke about it repeatedly in front of people; "It cost so much money to marry a poor woman, it's really not worth it!" Although this eldest daughter-in-law was very capable and filial to her, she still couldn't win Mrs. Zhang's favor. Even the maids secretly said; "Isn't the eldest grandma as poor as us?" Some even said; "No wonder the wife doesn't like her."</p>
<p>Recently, Mrs. Zhang married a second daughter-in-law. Needless to say, when she arranged the engagement for her son, the first condition she asked was "Is the woman's family rich and powerful?" The matchmaker praised her in every possible way; "The woman's family is really rich. Her father owns two large pawnshops and four foreign goods stores, making a lot of money every year. Several of her brothers-in-law all work in banks." This made Mrs. Zhang so happy that the marriage was settled in one go.</p>
<p>That was not a lie. On the day the second son got married, the Zhang family was filled with joy and the sound of drums and music filled the sky. The new daughter-in-law's "dowry" was indeed rich and plentiful, filling three or four moving trucks. A room was filled with colorful brocades, almost all of which were precious things, attracting people to watch and admire them. Mrs. Zhang felt that she had been blessed by heaven.</p>
<p>After the second grandma married in, Mrs. Zhang naturally loved her very much. She always took her with her when she went to restaurants and theaters. But what about the eldest grandma? She could never enjoy this favor, but she understood very well; "This is because the daughter of a poor family cannot afford a rich "dowry"." Alas! The daughters of poor families have such unspeakable pain when they marry as daughters-in-law.</p>

<h3 id="e225">The Lesson of the Pancake Shop <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Gui</p>
<p>Behind our school, on a street, there are two pancake shops, facing each other. Initially, their business scale and the pancakes they made were all on the same level.</p>
<p>But the situation has changed recently.</p>
<p>Shop A has recently been improved, adding many varieties, such as lard pancakes, ham pancakes, etc. The taste is really much better than before. Moreover, white sugar mixed with red and green silk, red ham, green onions, and white lard are placed in snow-white basins and displayed on the table. The form has also improved a lot, and the business is developing rapidly.</p>
<p>Shop B, however, remains the same, sticking to the old ways. The original customers have been attracted to Shop A. The unclean pancakes and fried dough sticks are unattended. Its boss stares at the opposite peer with jealousy and envy. Obviously, Shop A has developed due to improvement, and Shop B has been eliminated due to conservatism.</p>
<p>From small to large, the way of business is like this. Especially in the modern and fiercely competitive business field, we must strive for improvement.</p>

<p>— Shui Ye</p>
<p>On the day of the abolished Dragon Boat Festival, a cement alley was filled with the aroma of rice dumplings. Many children had the character "king" written on their foreheads, and many children were wearing yellow tiger clothes. They had smiles on their faces because it was a happy day. Two × officials came from afar, carrying empty briefcases on their backs. They stopped at a door and said to the people inside, "The Dragon Boat Festival is here. Thank you. Give us some money for wine." The people inside said, "The lunar calendar has been abolished. Why are you still asking for money on the holiday?" The two of them said calmly, "We are not abolishing the lunar calendar, we are maintaining it." The owner gave them 20 cents, both as a reward for their usual help and to maintain the already abolished lunar calendar.</p>

<h3 id="e227">Terminalia <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Song Lu</p>
<p>In the literary column of this journal a few days ago, I read a bamboo branch poem by Zhang Gongyu about women. The original poem is like this:</p>
<p>"Cicada clothes lean against arms, revealing creamy chest, short hair, black threads, curling and unkempt; the most soul-stirring place is the gully, deeply hidden terminalia on the two high peaks."</p>
<p>"Terminalia", this term, it seems that some people not only do not understand its allusion, but also may not understand its explanation, so I will give it a textual research.</p>
<p>It turns out that this allusion comes from the Anecdotes of the Tang Palace. The general facts are like this:</p>
<p>"Yang Guifei had an affair with An Lushan. An mistakenly scratched the Consort's breast with his claws. The Consort cried and said: "It is my fault to have an affair with you!" Fearing that the Emperor would see it, she embroidered a chest cover to cover it, and named it terminalia."</p>
<p>In this way, terminalia is a women's chest-hugging embroidered garment, which is the so-called "bodice". If it is compared with modern costumes, it is also the role of a small vest.</p>
<p>Originally, the binding of women's chests was a bad habit. This custom may not have existed before the Tang Dynasty? The one who created this was Yang Guifei, and the reason why Yang Guifei did this is also laughable, because she was scratched on the nipple by An Lushan, and she used this to deceive Emperor Ming. Then, as customs continued, this trend was actually imitating Yang Guifei's actions. To put it bluntly, it can't help but make people laugh.</p>
<p>Since the past few years, the voice of promoting breast-release has been expanding day by day. The small vest has been overthrown. Many modern women, with their towering peaks hidden on their chests, swagger through the market, with great seduction, which makes general moral scholars criticize it as "related to the morality of lewdness." Although I am an extreme supporter of the breast-release movement, after seeing that kind of "fleshy seduction", I can't help but regard the advocacy of big breasts and the reform of clothing as problems that need to be studied urgently.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, this article will be put on hold for now. If there is an opportunity, I will write another article to discuss women's clothing.</p>

<p>▲Public Notice▲</p>
<p>Public Notice regarding the Delivery of Litigation Documents:</p>
<p>All fees that this court collects from parties for the delivery of litigation documents by court clerks are clearly marked with the amount due on the documents. Fees are collected accordingly, and a receipt is issued as proof. No extra fees are allowed whatsoever. This has been the practice for a long time. However, we fear that over time, the court clerks may become complacent and take the matter lightly, or that some may still solicit additional payments from the parties. Strict prevention is necessary to reduce litigation burdens. Therefore, this notice is issued. If, in the future, any parties encounter court clerks soliciting additional payments, they may immediately report the names of the clerks to the court. Upon verification, strict punishment will be imposed without leniency. Please take note of this.</p>
